<p>今後國際政治之趨向。不外二途。㈠各大國繼續維持國聯盟約與凱洛公約。并促進此兩大集合系統之關係。以應付新現實。㈡各大國加速作軍事凖備。以支持或毁壞此兩大集合系統。而分别謀本身權利之擴展或確保。</p>
<p>國聯組織實爲集合系統之中堅。然欲實現其使命。不可不具備兩大基本條件。第一必須羅致各大國於一堂。第二必須有實行强制盟約破壞國之方法。而此一條件。又有互相牽連之關係。如許年來。國聯不能盡如一九一八年間世人之其望。卽因上述關係不甚圓滿之故。</p>
<p>今日英國與其海外自治殖民地。固以維持現狀爲職志。不願徒自紛更故不惟國聯盟約與凱洛公約。早經簽訂。舉凡國際公斷及和解條約。亦多方參加。鮮有例外。今後衡情度理。自願支持各該集合系統。以貫澈其初衷。英國鑒於今後國聯之成敗關鍵。悉繫於裁軍會議。而欲求裁軍會議之進展。又必須予德國以「平等。」法國以「安全。」是以於本年一月三十一日公布裁軍節略。提議將軍備之平均調整。與政治之安全保障。合併辦理。又以德國之重返國聯爲必要條件凡此原則。無可非議。所難者。厥在遇有破壞各該原則之事。如保得發揮實行裁制之權威耳。所謂裁制之眞價値。惟由各國集合行動而後顯。不然。若僅由一二國負裁制之責則爲效必等於零。有時操之太急或適足以釀成戰禍。未可知也。</p>
<p>故揣度英國今後之外交方針。必以拉攏國聯會員國與凱洛公約簽字國爲指歸。其間美國態度。尤爲其注意之焦點。顧美國則雅不欲捲入歐亞漩渦。作繭自縳。觀其數年來負責人員之主張。最有鮮明色彩者。當推一九三二年八月史蒂生之宣言。與一九三三年五月台維斯之演辭。然據二氏之表示。充其量亦不過謂在裁軍公約簽訂後國際間發見有破壞凱洛公約之事。如經各國及美國一致確定某某爲破壞國。則當各國聯合裁制該國時美國將放棄其戰時之中立權利而已。</p>
<p>顧美國欲不受戰神之包圍。亦自有其限度。蓋按諸實際之經騐。在一世界戰爭之局面下。享有重大國際商業利益如美國者。必不肯如史台二氏之所言。放棄其戰時中立之權利。致失暴富之良機。但又必不能貫澈其中立權利而同時嚴守中立。爲美國計。旣不欲捲入歐亞戰爭之漩渦。又欲保全其中立之權利。則惟有設法限制戰爭範圍之局部化。勿使擴大而已。然此亦僅在英國同時維持中立而後可。若英國一旦參戰。美國又不肯放棄其中立權利。則終至與英衝突而後已。蓋以兩國地理歷史及立國利害之密切。其今後之和戰大計。合則俱利。分則俱傷。可斷言也。</p>
<p>但欲英國遷就美國。在下屆國際戰爭中採取同一步驟。而維持中立。顧有困難。蓋英國與其自治殖民地。旣爲國聯會員國。而英倫政府又爲洛卡諾條約之簽字者。對於歐陸糾紛。自不能如美國可以袖手作壁上觀也。</p>
<p>總之英美戰爭固爲兩國人民之最所顧忌。而觀於今後國際政治之趨向。則並非絶無可能性。欲此戰爭不爆發。在英人立塲。須由美國共同肩起維持和平之責任。而在美人立塲。須由英國共同採取保守中立之政策。南轅北轍。不相爲謀。吾人深覺日内瓦裁軍會議如歸失敗。英美關係必將爲此後國際戰爭擴大與否之關鍵。屆時英國當召集帝國會議。以交換母國與自治殖民地間之意見。而確定其對美政策焉。</p>

<h3 id="c113">英商會與中國協會滬支會前日聯席會議 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>字林報云、本埠英商會與中國恊會滬支會、昨（十二）日在上海總會、舉行聯席年會、演說者有商會會長馬歇爾、駐滬英總領事白利南、英使署商務參贊皮爾等、馬歇爾首先致詞、泛述各端如下、</p>
<p>（一）中國之貿易上年年會中曾述及一九三二年之貿易、殆爲中國貿易史上最惡劣年份之一、而一九三三年更見衰落、是年除閩變贛亂與北方之小騷擾外、中國無往年之重大内戰或騷亂、而足影響廣大區域之商業者、中國之貿易、雖受束縛的捐稅與時局不靖等之妨害、但貿易之衰落、其主因實由於中國國外之局勢、</p>
<p>（二）内亂閩變雖從未危及中央政府、但政府因以支出軍費甚巨、否則、此欵可用於建設事業、贛省等處剿共軍事、仍需大軍、但政府已悉該問題所含之經濟性質、故現正努力於農村之復興、政府之工作、殊非易易、必須假以時日始克奏功、但苟非改善農村工作者之經濟狀况、建設適當之農村制度、廢除一切苛捐雜稅、則不能滅除共產主義、而好亂者仍有播種破壞主義之沃腴園地、農村發展與新生活運動、刻正迅速傳播全國、一般人士之熱誠、如能長此不變、則必有重大影響及於人民之生活、且可直接裨益經濟狀况中國如能依提倡新生活運動者所定之原則、改築其基礎、而獲成功、則上層之構造、正不必爲之慮也、</p>
<p>（三）購買力一九三三年貿易之衰落、多由因世界經濟厄運之結果、而購買力减小、及許多國家採用人爲的方法、以求回復國家繁榮所致、茲將一九三三年與三二年中國輸入與輸出貿易總額相比較（除去東三省）一九三三年减少一萬三千六百萬元、或約百分之十五、稅收則因關稅增加之故、反增四千六百萬元、新稅則於一九三三年實施、其中多有太高者、致輸入貿易大受摧殘、惟儘可以科學方法加以修正、而使貿易與稅收兩無損害、目前之稅則、旣足妨害正當貿易、而又使某某數種貨物私運得以獲利、故正當貿易者與稅入、兩俱受損、</p>
<p>（四）工廠是年裝備電力機以製造内國銷費各種物品之工廠、增添者雖不見盛、然仍步步而進、目前許多工廠之產量、雖比較微細、而其運動、亦良足注意、紗廠營業雖見蕭索、仍有新廠開設、惟在外省者較多、將來交通便利、比種發展、必更廣及、漂白染布業、亦見發展最新式之廠數家、現正在建造中、又呢羢織造業、中國向無人注意及之現因毛製材料取稅甚昻、而需求日見增高、故已有人定購織造呢羢機、將來繼起從事是業者、必大有其人也、供發光與實業用之電力設備、現大爲人所注意、他日時局安靖、或天災消滅、則全國需求者、必可大增、</p>
<p>（五）鐵路公路與電報粤漢鐵路借英國所退還庚子賠欵之欵、已開工興築計長二百二十哩、大約三年之内、可以造竣、尙有一重要鐵路、現由浙省當局趕工建築、卽杭江鐵路是、現已通至玉山、日後將取道萍鄉、與粤漢鐵路相接、各省公路、之建築、現亦在積極進行中、京滬大道、今夏可成、幹路旣成、續修支路、可使蘇省實業發展、更易進步、照目前之程率計之、不久各大邑可以公路網銜接之、此與國家政洽經濟社會生活、均大有裨益、此外且可便利交通、與物產之運輸、電話與電報之交通、藉無綫與陸綫之擴張、亦有進步、本年之初、眞茹馬可尼無綫電臺、已能與英倫直接通無綫電報、不久當可與英倫成立商務電話交通、國内交通之進步、當大有助於商業、</p>
<p>（六）西比利亞郵件商業多賴信息靈捷、今以政治之困難、中歐來往之郵件、不能利用大連最速之路綫、以致遞送延遲、使商家等大受損失、並甚感不便、今望能早日消除此種商業上之障碍、</p>
<p>（七）改兩爲元政府與商界、今均通用銀元、若銀元之成分與重量長此不變、則此舉殊有利商業、中央造幣廠所鑄之銀幣、經按時化騐、其重量與成分、未見有何差異、</p>
<p>（八）銀價之漲落銀價以人爲的方法、而使漲高、若其他物品不隨以同漲、則不能發生任何長久有益之效果、卽在產銀國亦然、中國爲用銀國、任何人爲的方法、提高銀價、將碍及其輸出貿易、並增高已見龐大之出超、而將發生有害貿易與商業之結果、故希望外國現所堅主之建議、能予打銷、</p>
<p>（九）新權衡度量制海關採用新制後、其所遇之困難、不若初料之甚、雖折合之時、殊多麻煩、耽擱時間、但改革初行之時、自不能免、　　（十）中外訟案商人遇商業爭端、雖仍不願向地方法院起訴、而願在法院之外調解、但聞經交涉之結果、關於上訴與延宕等事、已有所修改、其結果使民法行政已有進步、而無謂之上訴案、逐見减少、但需改革之處今尚多也、</p>
<p>（十一）商品標識商品註明出產國之條例其實行期、已由一九三三年八月一日、延至一九三四年七月一日、但最近所訂之條例仍多技術上之窒碍、實行之前、有作種種修正之必要、</p>
<p>（十二）外人投資中國當局、雖常引外人注意投資中國之機會、但中國長此歧視外體管理全部與一部分之工廠出品、則似難吸引外人之資本、中國和向惟鼓勵實業家、而對於農業家與農材工作者之需要與幸福、絶不關心、今則已知從事農村發展、深望此後農工並重、無所軒輊、蓋中國之實業、若長此漠視農業、則必無成功之望也、是年中國之貿易與商業、雖見衰落、然於種種方面已獲有眞正進步、各省各邑物質上之發展、特其一端耳、中國當局、現努力改善其國民生活、必發生有利之反響、及於貿易狀况云云、馬歇爾述畢、後報告一年來商會中所辦之事業、次由英總領事</p>
<h3 id="c114">白利南致詞 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>略謂、英政府對華政策、一言以蔽之、卽願依條約輔助中國發展與維持有實效的與穩固的政府是、英政府具此宗旨、曾聲明願就可能的範圍徇從華人之志願與企望、而一面對英人現有之利益予以相當之注重、日者英使賈德幹爵士、曾在宴會席上、告知吾人、</p>
<p>英政府此項政策、迄未更變、吾人所最關心者、厥爲中英間之貿易、吾人之主要目的物厥爲中國市塲、他日各省回復安寗狀况、此市塲必能膨脹無已、而能予吾人以此種狀况之唯一力量者、厥爲强有力之中國政府、故吾人對於華人之望郅治、與由彼等自己洽理、能與同情也、至於中國内部之不靖吾人談論及此、未可過於躁急、或張大其詞、要知中國幅員之廣、與歐洲相埒、歐洲今日亦多不靖也云云、次由馬歇爾申謝白氏、並請</p>
<p>皮爾演說皮爾起立致詞、略謂、會長頃曾述及中國輸出輸入貿易狀况、並請諸君注意其遞落、查一九三一年與三二年减落不下百分之三十三、一九三三年復落百分之十五、本年一二兩月、續落百分之二十、中國貿易、有一大弱點、厥爲輸出貿易之所估成數、不及輸入之半、正不知將以何法彌補之、海外華僑每年雖有巨欵滙回、但恐每年不足二千五百萬鎊、果爾、則尙餘二千五百萬鎊、無法抵補、中國輸入貿易、今頗受國内產品之影響、此以棉織業可爲其證、生棉輸入、一九一二年爲二十五萬擔、一九三二年已增至三百七十五萬擔、皆供本國各廠製紗織布之用、在此二十年内、棉紗已由二百五十萬擔落至九萬六千擔、餘悉以國内所製者代之矣、棉織物已由二百萬擔减至二十萬擔、在最近四五年内、減落百分之六十之多、此固爲英國商家所極不歡迎者、但英國今日輸入中國之棉貨、較之已往十年、成數仍有增無减、英國今爲中國所需棉貨之第二最大供給者、若就不列顚帝國全部言之、則爲第一最大之供給者、蓋佔輸入總數百分之三十也、中國對英輸出、其成數較之已往十年、亦見增高英國爲華蛋最大之購主、其輸入英國之數、實屬首列、已打倒丹麥、上年輸英之蛋、共値英金二百五十萬鎊有奇、英國對華貿易之增加、非因中國抵制日貨之故、實由英國競爭能力優長所致、皮氏繼言中國幅員廣大、户口繁盛、且民皆忍苦耐勞、將來地方安靖、實業指導得人、則必能迅速在世界大國中佔一位置云云、次乃報告賬目、經會衆通過、及選舉新董事、而舊董事全體復被選、次乃接開中國恊會會議演說者僅會長胡德海一人、泛論各事、並述及中　政局、</p>

<p>申時社云、中航公司十六號塞可斯機失踪四日、昨日自晨起、各方續派飛機十架、出發搜索、至下午五時半、各機陸續飛返、仍無結果、僅發現一極可注意之線索、據出動之一機師諾力斯、於午後三時半返公司報告、彼曾在遠離魚腥腦約二十英里處之金唐山島降落、據該處村民相告、該機於星期二晨、曾飛經該島、惟係屬向西方飛去、公司據報、今晨將派機直往浙贛邊界鄱陽湖一帶偵查、同時對該機搭客某人、亦發現可疑之點、申時社記者、特將詳情探誌如次、</p>
<h3 id="c122">十機出動沿綫搜索 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>

<p>昨日搜索結果、據同時出發之諾利斯機師、於下午三時半飛回、向公司報告、該機昨曾飛至遠離魚星腦（ＶｏｌｏａｎｏＩｓｌａｎｄ）（據該處卽爲失機當日八時半電告返航地點）二十英哩處之金塘山島（ＫｉｎｇｔｏｎＩｓｌａｎｄ）降落、各處找尋、據該處島民報告、該失機於星期二晨九時、尙飛過該島、惟其方向係向西飛去、全島人民、均所共見、據公司及專家等、根據該項報告、研究推測、該機尙未失事、决有其他原因、蓋該機當日八時半至魚腥腦時、曾電告已於該處飛返、今在九時尙在該島西飛、顯係未曾飛反、亦未失事、别有不可捉摸之原因、</p>

<p>然而，我們在此還可肯定的說一句，這一妥恊對中國民族確是具有非常的嚴得性，它明明將中國民族推入殖民地的可能，這一點是每個研究者應非常警惕的。</p>
<p>以上自然不過是對這一題作了一點研究的提要，再詳細的檢討然請讀者自已去進行罷！這是非常有趣味的問題。我們更要請趙君將我們提出的要點及研究方法與趙君指的「國際問題評論家」的意見及看法，作個對照，我們不同的地方是在何處呢？</p>
<p>由此，我們可知，理論學習固不易，理論運用則列要難了。曰此我們又覺悟到純作抽象的理論的研究，祗能成爲書齋裏的學究，對於「天下蒼生」是無多大用處的。反之，我們只有從一切實踐各纔能眞正的把握住理論，實在成了不可認的眞理。但前者易於從事，後者就非下一番苦功不可。譬如，近幾年來中國介紹過來的史的唯物論的書籍也算不少了，但能拏它來運用到中國實際去的眞正少到「鳳毛麟角」。現在中國需要的已走過純作原理的研究的界限了。尤其像我們這類生活的人，卽全想讀幾本原論的書，一定也是爲了需要運用纔去讀它的，所以，在這裏，編者不得不特爲提出，希望讀者們多多注意運用，學了必需運用、不要專抱死的書本子了。</p>
<p>對於趙君這次通信，自然同時給了一般讀者一個學習觀察國際問題的機會。但是，從趙君的來信中，又證明了我們以前寫的那幾篇文字並未十分被讀者了解，至少還不能拏它來應用。我們再向讀者諸君提議，如果你們覺得某些原理的書感覺不易讀懽時，最好多多注意運用了正確方法的例證，卽關於研究各方面的文字。「讀書問答」欄内的東西，自然，有一些還是値得諸君一閱的。</p>
<p>以外，我們還希望讀者能提出自已運用方法的一些實騐給我們，（我們不要怕錯，怕幼稚。）將我們生活更進到推讀書眞正理論與實踐的配合。</p>

<p>香港隊得勝利後此廣州隊嘗一再反攻、但屢被中衛綫擊退、卒不能逞、無何球証歐傑生戰笛長鳴、二十二員戰將、亦遵命休戰矣、以個人球藝而言、廣州馮景祥、李天生·譚澕柏最爲出色、葉北華病後、球藝依然、但氣力略差、似不若前者之勇悍、黃季良之守衛、無可非議、中衛除劉慶慶才外、似無足取、港隊則以李惠堂·鄭季良·曹桂成三人表演至佳、中衛綫梁榮照李國威亦不劣、何佐賢頗嫌力弱、與後衛之梁選贊同病、劉茂表演亦佳、守門黃黃繼、原屬南華乙組、但是日戰來、大致不錯、意者黃亦可造之材歟、</p>

<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>昨晚到了　　城，看夕陽　没在有死去，便拖　　　，出南門，沿浣紗溪，去古　　村　訪了小小的西施祠。就在這兒，痛心地瞧見了中年尼姑在佛堂裏　　那帶髮小姑娘的慘劇，再鼓不起詩人的心情，去看對江金鷄山上的一片璀璨的黃昏春景。只得拾了幾片没有殘盡的紅葉，折回旅館來寫信寄給上海的曼麗，却有一點孤寂的情調。所以連晚膳都不用，就拿出被筒來睡，睁眼一直到了天明，這天却晴爽得使人愉快。</p>
<p>在約淸晨七點鐘時候，就坐了人力車，離開蒼鬰的古城，一路浸在迷漫的霧天裏，跟着游龍山脈迤　北去、山中啼着畫眉，靜而冷。到草塔鎭，太陽已變成銀灰色。一直入靑口途中，風景太好了。從靑口去五洩寺，要渡一十八個水澗，若非旱時；必需雇一種搖籃式的篾　，坐在裏面，由扛夫扛着，才能渡澗。但我去的時候，晴已一個多月，所以赤着脚，穿着草鞋，捲起犢鼻褲，很安閒地在澗水上經過，只三里路光景，五洩禪寺就落入眼簾來了。</p>
<p>五洩寺原名永安寺，凡來看瀑的人，因爲時間關係，在此必需食宿，我們便進去和印宏和尙說妥，一面吃了葷腥午飯之後，就去找瀑布去。這裏的寺僧，旣不戒殺，又不唸經，左袵留髮，就和在家人一樣。</p>
<p>所謂五洩，乃是發源於紫　村的一條瀑布，從各　岩　中，分上下曲折五個階級噴瀉出來的泉水而言。我們在印宏和尙的指導下，出寺北門，從石道上走了百步，登牛　山幾級，全是竹林，靑蒼的葉，幛滿高空，却從蔭隙裏流出一絲一片的陽光，照在山徑上，好像印了幾朶浮　的白花。這時候，在萬篠叢中，已聽到很大的泉聲，越走近，那聲音越響，我們正各抬頭向山上望去，尋覓那轟雷似的奇響，但印宏歪過頭來，立定了脚，伸出一根手指，向左面點着說；</p>
<p>「兀的不是第五洩？」</p>
<p>立刻衆人都出乎意料之外的站定了。注目一看。眞的在削天的石壁上，掛下一條銀光四射的大蟒，這樣粗壯地，憤怒地，從空中飛舞下來，擊在屋　上，作出猛烈的狂吼。</p>
<p>「喲！偉大！」我呌，一面向左走下石灘去，打算坐在那兒看個痛快。</p>
<p>「還有更偉大的哩。跟着來，朋友們！這和尙倒也有趣，他是很快地又向響鐵嶺上走去，乎裏不用杖，跑的却快，我們也只得追隨着。那豪放的瀑聲，依然留在耳裏，雪白的泉色，依然流在眼前。眞不知道所謂更偉大的又是怎樣呢？一種好奇的心情，鼓舞着我底雙腿，一點不討饒，一點不休息，居然一口氣發了半山，至此就没有路了。我們就入間道叢薄中，披棘而下，那没有人踏的靑草，非常之滑，草以生得高，往往呑没了全身，矮小的人影，在繁密的亂榛間隱約，傳出瑟瑟瑟瑟的聲音，只聽得前面呌了聲一啊」，那人就溜跌了，後面又有人跌倒，所有手杖幾乎失了效用。</p>
<h3 id="c200">五洩觀瀑（下） <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>好容易爬到高巔，向下眺望，見第二洩的懸瀑，分左右兩股衝激在斜石上，急流入方潭這潭土人喚他作棺材潭，水又從潭，水又從潭裏順勢跳躍而出，沿石坡下瀉，竟二三十丈遠，有如廬山天橋瀑布的奔放，自此向左轉下，便瞧見龍頭似的石罅，接着有孔的石板，正如一個井口，在口裏掛下瀑布二列，那氣勢是洶湧滂礴，噴雪濺玉，水花千朶萬朶的起滅，像老龍在那兒欬吐，這是第一洩。看了好久，泉聲倒並不怎樣雄渾，大約離開太遠的緣故。再緣危崖向下，在藤葛裏用足心神，一步一步攀下去，一手拿了手杖，一手抓在生刺的野草上，血從皮　裏一點一滴的鑽出，我却忘記了痛苦。我是注意於自己更大的生命，乃掛在百仭危崖的一棵小樹，一叢野草之上，我也曾戰抖地用雙眼下瞰那深䆳的大壑，我正匐伏爬行在挺立的石壁上，要是··呀！我不敢想，要是我的任何一隻手失了憑依的時候呢？要是脚踏的冬靑小樹連根拔起來的時候呢？要是手攀的石角鬆動滾下來的時候呢！喲！今天我才知道了遊山的眞意義！那坐在筍輿裏吸雪茄的人們會懂得危峰惡　嗎？又何怪水經注的酈道元談「中三洩不可得至」的話！而現今寫五洩遊記的文人，還是摭拾酈道元的陳言，而不敢親身歷險，眞是丢臉！</p>
<p>我們手足並用的結果，終於達到了三洩。三洩是兩折飛泉，流過蒙有積藻的大石頭上，縱橫有五六丈闊，一齊急迫地直瀉，好像前年漢口張公場突然被决去了的潮水一樣；這兒完全是赭紅的大石，烏黑的大石，茶靑的大石，都上下橫斜着，走在上面，就遇草鞋，一不留心，也會溜得跌交。所以向下爬時，要用背脊靠石慢慢兒瀉下去，向上起來，要把胸部緊覆在石上，用雙手極力提起體重，才能濟事。至於手杖，因爲和石都是硬的東西，承不住力，千萬不可用。那宏急的飛泉，就在這些滑石上朝夜磨洗。　注在石罅裏，向空谷逝去。這是第三洩，在五洩之中要算最闊大了。</p>
<p>從大石上點起脚尖，辛苦地渡過三洩，風前又有瀑聲洪亮，却瞧不見影，這便是第四洩。看到側邊蹲有黑石塊，像一條威猛的伏虎似的；我們便先後爬了上去。攀住下臨無地而是一望皆水的石尖上，探出首級來向那猶如兩扇門似的石洞裏窺察，只見一簇飛瀑的側面，不知從何處漂出，傾向深潭裏，分兩折奔騰而下，迫促湍急，勢不可當。這是五洩中最奇險的一洩。立在那兒，世界完全給泉聲包圍，我們是被形容得格外藐小，格外無力了。</p>
<p>可惜這樣的遊山，連生命都隨時有犧牲的可能，未便携帶攝影機爲它攝進鏡頭，眞是憾事！</p>
<p>這一晚，就宿在東龍湫的野寺裏，作了一個疲倦恐怖的春夢。</p>
<h3 id="c201">遊具 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>遊山玩水，爲人生唯一樂事，脫能濟之以遊具，則爲樂益永。西方人有以刀叉杯皿水樽酒罍之屬，合爲一篋，以供出遊時作辟克臬Ｐｉｃｎｉｃ（譯意野餐）之用者；又有一種旅行凳，作三角形，以帆布製，摺疊之，則可代行杖，厥製絶精，遊人便之。輓近以來，吾國旅行團體風起雲湧，春秋佳日，舟車絡繹中，一一皆遊人也。顧吾人求之國貨中，竟不能得一遊具，寗非憾事？讀淸人吳澹川氏筆記，謂黃山有江臞生者，自稱臥雲葊居士，作遊山具，刳柳木爲扁石，（卽扁擔，石轉音擔）塗以漆，光黝堅緻，荷兩竹𥮏，𥮏數層，懸扁石�</p>
<p>兩頭，所貯袖珍詩韻，五色仿宋箋佳硯石筆墨之屬；及銅茶酒器　，秘色飲食器沙壼瓦盆炊爐扇火箸火燧漆休銚斑竹箸等物，層層安放，外盛洒乾匏棕蒲團掛扁石上，每一出遊，見者無不知爲臥雲葊居士物也。予意此等遊具，頗爲美備，惟須荷之以扁，作擔夫狀，似太累墜，非今人所宜，如能采取其長而改製之，則遊人必人置一具自爲恩物矣。</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>民二三年的春假，已在六橋三竺間消磨去了！湖上的春光，當然是很好的；但，我自己也莫名妙，總覺得方寸間，浮起着一種悵惘的痕，唉！吹不散。剪不斷，是愁雲！　　我在滬杭道中，但覺車窗以外，多添着，層簾子；這，不是尋常簾子，是大自然公司裏的出品，把那廉　的雨絲，組織而成疎疎密密的簾子。我惆悵地說；一巴巴的趕到西湖來聽雨，未免多事。」同遊的朱氏昆仲丨丨嘯谷，造五，同聲說道；「也許是天公替西子添妝吧。」抵杭，已夜，翌日，新霽，抬頭見好山如沐，這夜的雨，簡直是天公所賦的催妝詩了。成一絶句；</p>
<p>湖山新霽換容光，柳自靑靑草自芳；省識西施圖畫裏，昨宵一雨是催妝。</p>
<p>西子湖上開了一個流動的音樂會，泛湖的男女學生都在蜻蛉式艇子裏面奏樂唱歌；西湖本來百媚千嬌的，有這水面樂歌，益發助媚添嬌了。然而，如此乾坤，倘有聞歌的桓子野，也不過輒喚奈保罷了！成一絶句；</p>
<p>輕舟一葉逐輕波，水面吹簫水面歌；倘有當年桓子野，也應搔首喚如何。</p>
<p>湖上聞得一不幸的事，美總領事克銀漢挈其夫人來遊湖山，夫人忽罹急症，殁於杭州某醫院，人言係腦膜炎，織女星沈，當然要悲生銀漢了！成一絶句；</p>
<p>挈眷遊春樂未英，歡腸驀地變愁腸！星沈織女悲銀漢，天上人間兩渺茫。</p>
<p>錢武肅王小字婆留，生時，光怪滿室，其父要把他抛棄，仗着一個老婆子把他留養，所以呌做婆留。後來用三千鐵弩，把潮水射退了，其事，雖近神話，但，聽了，令人氣壯，現在灜海風潮正惡，那裏再來一個射退潮頭的錢婆留呢？成一絶句；</p>
<p>婆留祠下儘徘徊，鐵弩雄風，安在哉？</p>
<p>今日海波侵大陸，何人解得射潮來？</p>

<p>過桐廬，因而後水深，原輪達七里瀧，卽登鈞魚臺與謝臯羽亭。二亭雖不甚高，而臨眺甚佳，下臨江邊，舟小如魚，不知當時嚴子陵恃何奇術鈞得眞魚，殆漁翁之意不在魚與？同行有黃翁爲告老之海關職員，一識途老馬也。於歸途尼旅行社中職員折入鷺鶿溪。上岸行里許，乍間溪水潺潺，冲擊灘石而而作急湍，繼見石塊高下，成　長而矮三瀑布。水作碧綠色，流過淡黃石卵，問以雪白之浪花，配色之佳，非畫家所夢想得到。且近山實起於水涘，還山環繞於左右，向之舟行畫圖中者，今則步七詩句裏矣。繼至一處，二水東西對流，匯成前溪，作淼字形，竹木起伏三水之間，溪水不深可脫履而涉，然流急，有一二木排直衝而過，灘石滿溪，水乾時可資息坐時方没於水中水淸見底，魚蝦畢現。惜時迫，不敢久留，鷺鶿寺亦未暇入。杭時，已逾原定時間一小時矣。甚望旅行社以後於富春江遊程中，加入鷺鶿溪一項，更望旅杭者，毋忘順便一遊此山明水媚之　春江也。</p>

<p>靈巖在蘇州的西南三十里，高度也不過五倍於虎邱，並且叨乾隆的光，舖着磚的御道，狠平坦，所以上下一點不費力，就是脚力不健的？也可以勉强登臨。我遊靈岩，迄今已三次，第一次還在草橋中學讀書，鼓着勇氣，從蘇州走到靈巖，路上還遇着雨，遊興雖好，遊况甚是狼狽。可是至今　想，覺得童年不再，童心已失，要再來一回，已做不到了。第二次是在去年，和東吳附中師生同行，相隔廿二年，江山不殊，風景大異，本來靈巖寺只有寥寥數椽屋，現在粉垣缭繞，𢌞廊曲折，還在運斤施圬，興建崇樓，那兩個巨大的六角八角井，也在疏濬開鑿。據說都是前住持募化之力，前住持曾參夏超軍幕，所以他向闊太太那裏募到不少的錢，那時我已驚佩他佛法無邊了。　　這一回是第三次遊靈巖，計家眷等以外，還有親戚們，大小男女共有十一名口，因此興會狠好。可惜計算得時間太經濟，八點十分到胥門，爲了遊客過多，船不能容，已提早開行，只好目過而送之，狠無聊地挨過了兩小時，趁第二班汽船前去，到底時間太侷促，不能從容遊覽。靈岩寺的新建築，已大體完成，雖未髹漆，有數處可以憇坐茗話。有一輛火車，運送石礎石階上山。據工人說，從黎明到黃昏時，方能運送一次，可見費力。府士仁君說。還有挑石灰，磚，瓦，河砂。也是零雇山農，每斤給二文。所以山農的生活，以抬轎爲最好，可惜只有春秋兩季，遊人較多，纔有主顧。我說，山下的婦女，眞値得佩服，伊們忙時種田。閒時剌繡，忙裏偷閒便抬轎，文武全才，粗細兼能，試間世界上那一國的婦女，有此能耐？　　寺裏牆壁上貼滿了格言，有許多並非佛家語，因爲今住持是印光法師的高徒、主張新僧運動的。連白塔橋附近的法雲寺，也在黃牆上大書「大同主義，惟有佛學。衛生之道，素食最宜。」大槪也受了他的影響。佛法宏通，固宜如此，那麽佛法更見無邊了。</p>
<p>靈巖山的石，古樸不亞於天平，本來有名「烏龜望大湖」的，現在刻着一望佛來一三字，頗能化俗爲雅。倘然經好事者多擬名目，多加品題，還可以使名山生色。山上樹木狠少，近來雖已添種，年齒尙稚，最好再種些梅花桃花之類。春色更見爛　。</p>
<p>前幾天，中國淸明外國淸明，閙着喜相逢，盡船相接，美春連翩，掃墓之餘，便登山遊覽，無怪山上熱閙異常，石家飯店，無日不是座上客滿，速麻餅也多銷了我千萬枚。所以風景線和生活線是互相聯系的。</p>
<p>從蘇州到木凟，上午有兩班汽船，都來得及還來，就是坐人力車去也行，倘然將來築成了汽車路，當然更見便利了。</p>

<h3 id="c206">無極外差機的特殊病象及治療法 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>無極外差式收音機，往往有一種特殊怪病象，就是在週率較高的一段，收音成績極好，但接收週率較低的電台，聲音却極微弱，有時竟完全收不到，這種怪現象，或許是服務收音機者時常遇到而最費思索的一個難題，此項困難的主要病因，通常有下述　種；</p>
<p>（一）襯墊電容器容量不合無極外差機中間放大紴的週率，就是振盪級的振盪週率和外來訊號週率的差數，如中間放大級的週率是Ｉ７５Ｋ·Ｃ·則振盪線路必須使時常較高週率放大綫路高出Ｉ７５Ｋ·Ｃ·</p>
<p>凡調整綫路，其所能調諧的週率，全視其綫圈自感量與電容量的相乘積而定，簡以ＬＣ表之，計算週率的基本公式是Ｆ＝２ＮＬＣ＝Ｉ，細察公式；可知ＬＣ的相乘積與週率的平方成反比，如將週率兩倍，ＬＣ須降到原値的四分之一，週率三倍，ＬＣ須降至原値的九分之一，例如設週率５００ＫＣ（即波長六百米突），應有的ＬＣ乘積是·Ｉ，則Ｉ０００ＫＣ的ＬＣ應爲·０２５，適合原數四分之一，Ｉ５００ＫＣ的ＬＣ應爲·０ＩＩＩ卽原値的九分之一，廣播收音機週率的範圍，都自Ｉ５００ＫＣ丨丨５００ＫＣ，最高週率適爲最低的三倍，所以高週率級内的調整電容器，其最大電容量必須爲最小電容量的九倍，方可適用。</p>
<p>振盪級的週率，因須較高Ｉ７５ＫＣ，其週率範圍應爲Ｉ６７５ＫＣ丨６７５ＫＣ，最高與最低的比數是二倍半，故調整電容器的最大電容量需等於２１／２的平方（卽６Ｉ／４）乘其最小電容量，但通常收音機高週率級及振盪級的調整電容器，都是連軸式的，所以振盪級内必須串聯一電容器，以减少總電容量，使最大時適爲最小的６Ｉ／４倍，此串聯的電容器，稱爲襯墊電容器（ＰａｄｄｉｎｇＣｏｎｄｅｎｓｅｒ），圖示無極外差機高週率級及振盪級的簡單調整綫路，Ｃ卽襯墊電容器，容量如圖中所註，讀者如略加思索，當可明瞭其計算方法，如此電容器容量不合，則卽使在最小電容量時，校凖爲Ｉ６７５ＫＣ，及轉至最大電容量時，已與預定的Ｉ６７５ＫＣ，相差極遠，以致收音不能靈敏，所以這種病象第一項的治療法，卽校凖墊電容，器的電容量。</p>
<p>（二）振盪管停止振盪無極外差機振盪級，有時在週率較高（波長較短）一帶，雖能振盪，但旋至較低週率（波長較長）時，眞空管停止振盪，以致該段電台，寂無所聞，此項情形，亦爲最易犯之病因，眞空管所以不能振盪的原因，大約盪的原因，大約由於（一）屏電壓太低，（二）簾栅電壓太低，（三）眞空管陳舊，已失原的效能，（四）回授電能不足等，治療方法；先測量屏極及簾栅極的電壓，如覺太低，在交流收音機，須注意屏路及簾栅路内的電阻，有無損壞或變値，電容器有無漏電或短路，再檢騐眞空管，是否完好，如該機内另有同號的眞空管，不妨交交換試之，往往會有意外的收穫，最後應校配屏路的回授電能，如增加回授電容器的電容量，回授圈的交連密度等、極爲有效，總之，務使此眞空管在需要的週率範圍内，均能得極穩定的振盪。</p>

<p>— 潘煜先</p>
<p>收音機的Ａ電瓶常常要充電，也是一件麻煩的事，並且稍不留意，電液滲出，還有損毁衣物的危險。下面的一張圖是把燈絲串接後用Ｂ電降壓供給的，電阻Ｒ３是降壓電阻一千歐姆，Ｒ２五十歐姆·Ｒ１有五百歐姆阻力，最好能用可變電阻則兼可調節音量，眞空管如用二弗打省電式時，Ｒ３大槪一千二百歐姆已够，餘件不必更動，其他用件都是普通收音機用的。</p>

<p>— 鑑</p>
<p>如上述第（三）式，若ＲＯ與ＲＰ相等時，則其輸出Ｐ應爲；</p>
<p>Ｐ＝９Ｘ７８４Ｘ２０００丨丨（２０００＋２０００）２＝０８８２瓦特如是ＲＯ與ＲＰ相等時，則可得如下之公式</p>
<p>Ｐ（Ｍａｘ）＝Ｕ２ＥＧ０早丨丨４ＲＰ·····（４）</p>
<p>Ｐ（ｍａｘ）爲最大輸出，如將前例之數値代入（４）式，則其所得結果亦同，卽Ｐ（ｍａＸ）爲最大輸出，如將前例之數値代入（４）式，則其所得結果亦同，卽Ｐ（ｍａｘ）＝９Ｘ７８４丨丨４Ｘ２０００＝０８２瓦特　　但欲使電力管不遺眞（Ｕｎｄｉｓｔｏｒｔｅｄ）而動作適宜，則外部總阻ＲＯ必須採用適當大之數値，倘ＲＯ之値過低時，則易起失眞Ｏ於是欲使電力管獲得不失眞之最大輸出時，普通外部總阻ＲＯ之値，宜採用屏耗阻ＲＰ之二倍之値，卽</p>
<p>ＲＯ＝２ＲＰ</p>
<p>如是則不失眞之最大輸出</p>
<p>Ｐ（ｍａｘ）＝２ｕ２Ｅｇ２丨丨９Ｒｄ··（５）</p>
<p>（５）式中之ＥＧ爲實効値（ＥｆｆｅｃｔｉｖｅＶａｌｕｅ），但因輸入交流電壓（最高峯雷壓）之値不得超過直流之Ｖｉａｓ電壓値，故若將此點加参考慮，而假設Ｅｇ爲最高峯電壓時，則（５）式可改變如次式</p>
<p>Ｐ（ｍａｘ）＝Ｕ２Ｅｇ２丨丨９ＲＰ··（６）</p>
<p>茲以二四五號式眞空管爲例，而計算其不失眞之最大輸出。按該管之定數爲ＲＰ＝Ｒ９００１ｕ＝３·５Ｏ將此數代入公式（６），則得不失眞之最大輸出如下；</p>
<p>Ｐ（ｍａｘ）＝３·５Ｘ３·５ＸＥＧ２丨丨９ＸＩ９００</p>
<p>＝０·６７Ｅｇ２丨丨Ｉ０００瓦特＝０·６７Ｅｇ２千分瓦特</p>
<p>ＥＧ之高峯電壓爲五十弗打，卽Ｐ（ｍａｘ）＝０·６７Ｘ０２＝Ｉ６７５千分瓦特　　今將各種常用之電力管之輸出，依照上述計算，而得一表如次，参資讀者設計電力放大器時參考。</p>
<p>由計算之結果，吾人可知，輸出電力與栅電壓Ｅｇ成一比例，例如採用二四五號式管時，如Ｅｇ之電壓過低，則未能充分發揮其能力，此乃設計電力放大器之最關緊要者。</p>
<p>第二圖係利用二四五號式管爲末級電力放大之綫路。欲使末級電力放大管Ｖ３獲得最大輸出時Ｅｇ應供給以五十弗打之最高峯電壓，此電壓由低週率變壓器Ｔ２之次級綫圈得之，故若Ｔ２爲一與四之比時，初級綫圈Ｅ３之電壓應爲</p>
<p>Ｅ３＝５０丨４＝１２·５弗打</p>
<p>卽在Ｖ２眞空管之屏綫路需要一二·五伏脫之電壓，而此電壓由下式獲得者，卽Ｅ３＝Ｕ２Ｅ２</p>
<p>一式中Ｅ２爲Ｖ２眞空管之輸入電壓，Ｕ２爲Ｖ２管之實効放大率故Ｖ２管輸入電壓Ｅ２應爲</p>
<p>Ｅ２＝Ｅ３丨Ｕ＝１２·５丨６＝２·０８弗打</p>
<p>其次變壓器ＴＩ爲一與三之比，故Ｅ３應得Ｅ１＝２·０８丨丨３＝０·６６９弗打</p>
<p>卽在檢波管ＶＩ之屏綫路如有○·六六九弗打之電壓時，則可獲得二四五號式管之最大電力也。（完）</p>

<p>（三）計算地位在未繞綫時，應將鐵片空隙（Ｗｉｎｄｏｗ）用鉛筆在一張白紙上繪下寛度，再計算初級圈共需多少厚（計算時應加入絶緣紙及絶緣布厚度）次級綫圈多少厚，加上紙心及絶緣布，初級與次級間的絶緣布，總共厚度是多少，看這空隙適合不適合、以决定繞綫方針，不致臨了有裝不下的弊病，</p>
<p>（四）鐵片不能厚免起流致發熱而損失電能，</p>
<p>（五）絶緣不宜用厚紙在地位寛舒時，厚紙絶緣以爲可以格外安全，殊不知厚紙容易儲熱，於耐用上大相抵觸，　　（六）綫圈抽頭綫圈抽頭愈多。恰緣問題更是重要。各個抽頭最好能够絶巧排列在綫圈的兩端中任何一端·銲引之綫。宜平坦，銲畢用漆漆過銲處·引綫最好用扁平的導綫，俾下圈繞時可以一樣服貼·在綫圈高壓段時，其導綫必細，然在此高壓圈兩端及各抽頭所銲引綫、均宜用較粗導綫。抽頭不呆拉得太緊，往往有脫出線圈之弊。</p>
<p>（七）注意短路往往因爲線圈中有一圈短路，致短路間產生一種電壓。因此引起大量電流通過，而燒斷此回路，致全體無效。</p>
<p>（八）綫圈加蠟綫圈繞竣，放蠟中煎透，切忌用膠質如松香樹脂之類。因爲漆包綫遇到了這種東西，包裹的漆，很會溶掉，並且因爲牠們含潮容易，綫圈不會乾燥。</p>
<p>（九）鐵心旋緊鐵片插入綫圈後，應用鐵夾旋緊，免鐵片振動引起交流聲。最好再用瀝靑或磁漆漆固之。</p>

<h3 id="c211">羅傑士來華的任務 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>在過去的不久，美國自發表了羅斯福工的提高白銀價格問題以後；曾引起了吾國朝野人士極大的注意。有些人主張禁止現銀出口，以防萬一，也有人主張加徵銀稅，取寓禁於徵的方式。不過，這些都是無辦法中的一個辦法！</p>
<p>最近，羅氏爲了欲澈底明瞭遠東方面，對於提高白銀價格的影響及購買力起見；便特派羅傑士敎授和白銀專家勃唐二氏，來華實地調查，一行人已於九日晨抵滬，並聲明須往南京平津等處視察，至於他們在華約有一個月的勾留。但是，據吾們的推測，此次羅氏派羅傑氏的來華考察，實負有兩種重大使命；這裏，吾們國人，不能不加以注意的。</p>
<p>（一）美國當局自羅氏提倡藍鷹運動後，其金融組織便日形動搖，工潮之澎湃，其勢不可約束，此仆彼起的相繼在各地擴張而蔓延着。六七千失業工人都結隊游行，向政府攪擾，並大呼「吾們需要麵包和工作的口號」。這工潮的醖釀已在不可遏制的發展，所以使羅氏的藍鷹運動突受一重大打擊，其根本計劃亦隨之失其效用。他爲了要應付目前的困難環境起見，遂不得不將白銀價格提高，以便將他們的過剩產品向遠東市塲來傾銷，一方面救濟失業工人的生機，一方面則挽回國内工商業的衰落。然而，爲了要使傾銷便利，和鼓勵吾國民衆的購買力，因派了羅傑氏來華考察吾國各地的商業情形，及提高白銀價格後所受的影響。</p>
<p>（二）羅氏又爲了要實行他唯一的獨裁主義，以適應目前國際間的危機。因此，命羅傑士到遠東來探察各國情勢，赂地現狀，作一度凖確的透視，而有所凖備，俾使其國内有恃無恐，以便處理他整個的政策；其用心的深遠，不得不令人嘆服！</p>
<p>於此推測；羅傑士之此次不辭跋涉，來華調查的原因，實不難按圖索驥而探求得之。因他的來華，不僅是調查白銀問題，並且還有其他重要的任務在呢。聞說銀行界，亦因恐外界猜疑，故對於羅傑氏的抵滬，並不前往迎迓。然而現在雖如是，其將來之將來，未必會使人們不滋生疑竇的。要之，他們在事實上還宜加以檢點，加以審愼，則外界的誤會，自無足畏了。據報載；本埠新聞記者向羅傑氏詢問各項意見，所答盡屬無可捉摸之語，這令人不得不生懷疑。不過，吾們最後竟意外地聽到了一句動聽的頌讚語；「吾看中國乃一極有希望之國家」！眞是榮幸，那使吾們聽了却有「却之不恭」「受之有愧」之感！吾們中國居然在羅傑士心目中看來還有希望，甚至而極有希望！不禁使人有「孺子可以敎也」之慨了！</p>
<h3 id="c212">法律與人情　觀亡命者後 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>人類社會日漸進化，神道設敎已不能敷衍這社會的代進展，爲了要保護人類在社會中的安寗，於是產了法律。牠以至尊無極的高權來統治在社會中的一切人類，但是法律是一個死的圈套，牠做成了一個木枷，將活的人類向木枷的空窿中鑽，所以法律只能作正面的裁判，而不能透視到法律所不能注意的背面，譬如說罷，汽車輾死了一個行路人，自然這汽車夾在法律上講牠要受某一種裁判的。法律一定說殺人者償命，（我不懂法律，也没有和法律發生過明顯的關係，認爲殺人者償命，法律上一定有這末一條。）但是法律不能把這事件發生時的情形作一個人情的裁判，牠這死的木枷將一個活的汽車夫鎖住了。汽車夫輾死行人，在事實上並不一定是汽車夫的過失，在他行駛的職業上他一定也時常想避免這類不幸失事件發生，他無論如何不會故意將車子向一個行人身上撞去，然而我也没有說被汽車輾死的行路人都是自去尋死的，總之，在法律範圍之内，一件細小的事情，有時是法律所絶對没有預料到的矛盾。但是法律是至尊無上的，牠要執行牠的威權，有無數的事實是絶對相反了的。</p>
<p>亡命者中的亞侖，他想尋覓發展他工程的雄圖，終於潦倒窮途，被無賴强逼作盜。他旣没有預謀，在當時的事件上他是和那店主人是在同樣的地位，他是被逼着做了一次殺人越貨的强盜。亞侖是否願意，或者以後他就此加入了盜夥，圖面是没有告訴我們，然而法律以死的木枷判决了他十年苦役。</p>
<p>以後他越獄逃亡之後，移名改姓，從事於他醉心的工程事業，可見亞侖並不是一個甘願作盜的壞坯子，不過在法律知道他是個越獄的盜犯，他又被送進那死的木枷中去了。我們對於前者後者都可以作一個人情的討論，他强逼爲盜，正如汽車夫輾死行人有時實在是在不得已之情形之下，法律是見不到背面的。其次好像法律不允許一個犯罪的人懺悔，你一做了强盜，永遠没有翻身的一天，亞侖二次越獄也只能「余去矣」此生將亡命以終。」</p>
<p>致於這影片的暴露以文明號稱世界的美國的監獄的黑暗，電影專刋已詳述殆盡，牠差不多每一個圖面都攫住了觀衆的靈魂，何怪租界當局的禁映了。所以我也想說一說一個患罪之後應否這般的鞭打，凌辱，牛馬一般的執行苦役？</p>

<p>「但是比躑躅在十字街頭俄着肚子不是高妙的多嗎！」</p>
<p>「我别的事幹不好嗎？」</p>
<p>「屁事也臨不到我去做，社會生產過剩，裁工還來不及，加上從破產中的農村跑來的產業後備軍又不知有多少，等到我有工可做的時候，社會該已染上了一層熱的血液。」講得昻激時，險些把桌上的墨水瓶打翻。</p>
<p>但我們的老李腦子並不像部機器，抽了烟便會產生出多量的Ｉｎｓｐｉｒｓａｔｉｏｎ出來的，那時他便走出了斗室，跑向所謂低等人物的聚合處踱着步，廳他說是在低層人間找材料。</p>

<p>日本的料理店有日本菜。有支那的，也有西洋的，不過後兩者都日本化了，僅用了烹飪的方法和它的形式而已。他除了喜歡冷食之外，每餐的菜都合於營養的滋補，并且還有水菓，以助消化。講到他們的體格，那眞今非昔比了！學校裏對於體育衛生勞作極端注重，設備周到，還有那種種旅行，爬山，夏季設施的海濱生活等，無不切實施行，怕不多多後，他們要呌我們中國人倭子了吧？</p>

<p>— 非</p>
<p>吾在過去底不久，讀了本刋上頎萍君底大作「願來世化作男兒身」一文後，不禁引起了吾底反感；於是把吾積鬱多年，久欲一吐而没有吐出底一大堆話，統統要想在這裏發洩了。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的，吾對於無論那一種女人，總懷着一種不同底矛盾心理；妒嫉，羨慕；，但，倒底不知道還是妒嫉，還是羨慕，却連吾自己也有些莫明其所以然！</p>
<p>不過吾想做女人倒底是好，不論在那一方面，總要比較男人佔上好些便宜。她們在法律上，交際上，生活上，都容易比男人佔着優勝。「前世不曾修，今生投着男人該吃苦！」在無聊底時候，吾時常這麽地自怨自艾；假使吾是一個女子，是一個現代摩登女子底話。那末，隨便怎樣，總不致會像現在那樣地吃苦了。「遂令天下父母心，不重生男重生女！」白樂天在長恨歌裏，也曾這樣說過，可是，現時代却替他確切不易地證實了。所以她們在名義上雖然稍遜一籌，然而在物質底享受和金錢底供應上，却大大底優越了。諸位如果不信，不妨聽吾道來；要是你肯到市面上去考察一下，研究一下，那麽你不難得到以下底例子；香啦丨美啦丨芬芳啦丨娟秀啦丨娉婷，婀娜，妍麗，肉感，一切香艷動人底名詞，都給她們一箍腦兒佔了一個精光，臭男子只好望着垂涎欲滴。卽就在這一些上面看來，已經儘够你妒嫉，羡慕了。男人却就不然，滿身都是臭氣，臭汗，臭嘴，臭氣冲天，看了眞要使人討厭！吾想自古來底文人們，眞太可惡了，他們何以拿女人形容得這般地可愛，而把男人輕視得一錢不値，其用意究竟何在？</p>
<p>再講到享受一方面吧！則自會有許多鬚眉男子，盡心盡力地爲她們去効勞却情願自己作牛作馬，而不敢違背玉皇大帝底懿旨，「儘可驚天動地，不肯得罪玉皇大帝」，不錯，一些也不錯。雖有些人說；從前中國女子都給男子壓迫的，壓迫了四千多年没有機會翻身過。但是，吾以爲不獨從前這樣；就是現在何嘗有些兩樣呢？她們每天打扮得花枝招展底，會拿整個底肉體，笑靨，赤裸裸地去獻給男人玩弄，欣賞！在她們則本能地來享受那以肉體，笑靨，換來底報酬，物質，性慾，揮霍無度，消費無量。而在男人方面却驀地增加了負担底得壓；當然，現社會底不安定，不景氣，在她們至少也有一部份底責任，國家弄到這般田地，和她們未始没有關係的。一般女學生，摩登小姐，都情願去嫁給要人聞人作姨太太，這又爲些什麽？兩個靑年男子，爲了同時戀愛一個女子，而不惜犧牲，勢不兩立，甚至傷生命，廢事業都不顧；唐皇爲了一個楊玉環，而把偌大底江山都置之不顧，「不愛江山愛美人」！試問「江山」與「美人」孰重？這些，這些，都無非是爲了一個女子，「可憐方寸地多少世人迷」！一個女子究竟値得些什麽？會這樣地爭天奪地起來！所以有人說；世界上要是没有了女人和金錢，纔眞會有太平底日子，平靜無事底時候。不然儘管是庸人自擾，也没有什麽意義！女子是禍水，唉！吾不欲多說了。</p>
<p>現在把女人差不多已捧到了三十三天之外了，在不久將來，吾們男人底飯碗，恐怕都要給她們打個粉碎，噫！男人危險！</p>
<p>但是話又得要說回來了。這些倒底也是子子們自己不好，也許是自作自受，那當然不能專責備於女人的。可是，女人比男人要幸福，自然也是不可否認底事實，因此吾想要「來生願作女兒身」也自有吾底理由······</p>

<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>茲有敝友蔣君，他有一個難於解决的問題，以致精神上很受痛苦，我爲了友誼的緣故，想要减輕他的痛苦，但是我自己也不能爲他解决這個問題、因爲知道你是社會的導師，所以特地請求你指敎他吧！</p>
<p>事實是這樣；敝友蔣君現肄業於某大學　最近他與乙女訂婚，當他未訂婚之前。曾見愛於甲女，但甲女是一個目不識丁的鄉下姑娘，而且前曾以父母之命，媒妁之言，與另一個男子訂婚，這樣的婚約現在是解除了，（據說是對方的不成器，而且不屢行婚約，甲女的父母不要他，所以雙方自願把婚約解除了，）至於乙女呢！是一個十足的中學生，這一次敝友和她訂婚，也是由於某某的介紹，雙方的同意，並得家長的許可。敝友以前對於甲女祇有感情並無愛的成分；簡直是落花有意、流水無情，所以這一次才和乙女訂婚，誰知甲女這時候突然向敝友表示；大有「非君莫嫁」之態度，假使不能如願，惟有自殺，以報敝友。敝友看她這樣隆情厚誼，整個的心竟爲她佔據了；但已女對他的感情，也還不錯，並且已實行訂婚了，因此敝友處於兩難之間，事齊乎？事楚乎？竟無法應付。</p>
<p>若是就乙女而棄甲女，那麽，甲女如果去自殺，敝友不但對她不住，而且自己良心上也說不過去；若是就了甲女而棄乙女，也是不容易的，因爲現在已經雙方願意訂婚，而乙女是智識份子，何况他倆彼此感情也還不錯；若是倆者兼收，那麽，不但爲乙女所不許，（對甲女事現在乙女當然是不知道而與乙女訂婚事甲女是知道的）而且也是社會所不容。那麽，怎麽辦呢？請你於最近期間内在貴刋上指敎吧丨順頌撰安！張小昌敬上</p>
<p>答；尊友這種難題、局外人是不能解决的。因爲局外人的解答祇是站在理智的立塲，而「戀愛」及「結婚」等事却大半由當局者的感情所操縱的。所以白旁人想出的法子，卽令說得娓娓動聽，但是在要應用到實際上去的人看來，總嫌旁人代擬辦法是不切實的，是不能體貼到他的苦處的。何况這是一個三角戀愛的問題，最是使人陷於苦悶，毫無解决辦法的僵局自然旁人的話更是無用了。不過，旣蒙誠意相詢，編者也極願對此問題商討一下，聊供尊友的參考。</p>
<p>三角戀愛之所以難解决，就是被愛的一方對於愛他的兩方都愛，都要，但是二者不可得兼，於是「取捨」便成了大問題了，若兩方面又有了「捨他莫屬」的决心，更是没有辦法。「取捨」說起來也很簡戰的，娶甲就不娶乙，娶乙就不娶甲，乾脆之極，有什麽難處、不過，要是取捨得「對得起人家，又對不起自己」這就難了。但這也不是眞無辦法，却是應當注意着三個原則的；（一）以他自己（譬如尊友）的將來幸福或事業之發展爲前提，卽把兩個人比一比，究竟那個是適合於自己的配偶；（二）把對方兩人的情形比較一下，如果有一方再與他人成婚是較難的，那令自己對於她的愛情差些，也不能過於自私，（三）以自己對於對方所應負的責任計較一下，卽如你不與她結婚就有欺騙的性質之類。如果上述三種條件又互相衝突，則應當以第三項及第二項爲凖。總結一句話，戀愛，結婚固然是應以自己的主張爲前提，但假如在以前對於某方已經表示過了，或者接受了「愛」，那就不得不負責任，不能完全以自利爲出發點，更不能朝秦暮楚，隨意再同人家談愛了。</p>
<p>尊友的塲合，照上述條件看來，應有兩種判斷；卽在以前尊友如確未對甲女表示過愛，則現在甲女雖以死要挾，亦可置之不理；因爲照情理論，尊友並不要負什麽責任，自無對不起她的地方，她要自殺，不是太痴，就是太狂妄了。但是據編者猜想，尊友以前卽使没有愛甲的心，恐怕在形式上祗少有點愛情的表示，（起碼甲是這樣意味着）所以現在要棄她，不免有點問心有愧吧！而且，從事實上講，甲是鄉下女子，乙是「十足的中學生」，則擇婚也自以後者爲易，所以，依編者意思，尊友雖與乙女訂有婚約，却還是應當不履約，而與甲女結婚，當然這樣是對不住乙的，但是兩害取其輕，取甲捨乙，無疑是要較取乙捨甲害輕一點罷。編者</p>

<p>— 曼之</p>
<p>普寗答聲，「是，大少爺回來了。」</p>
<p>「回來了！回來了！」六爺發瘋似地口裏說着，揑緊拳頭儘在書房裏頭走來走去。普寗還是站在那裏不敢動。他的眼睛跟着六爺的身體在房子裏頭轉着。六爺忽然站住在窗前，眼睛望着窗外在受雨打的綠芭蕉；站了一回又回過身來走着。走了一回，又在窗下的書桌子前面站住，忽然用拳頭擊了書桌子一下，大聲地呌着，</p>
<p>「自己殺死！」</p>
<p>爺又說，</p>
<p>「話話地將他打死！」</p>
<p>說着，又回過身來走着。普寗心裏想着，「六爺氣得發瘋了！大少爺也實」</p>
<p>在不肖，當年不要那樣跟着人家胡閙，六爺也不會不喜歡他！家裏有田有地的人也跟着人家胡閙，眞是該打。」</p>
<p>六爺走到房子的中央，忽然又站住，對普寗說，</p>
<p>「不要走漏風聲，懂得嗎？」</p>
<p>普寗回說，「知道的，六爺。」</p>
<p>六爺又吩咐他說，「告訴太太和少奶奶，今天不要放他走，我到二爺那邊就來。」</p>
<p>普寗應了聲是，走出去了。六爺摸到了一把紙傘兒接着就出門。二爺的書齋並不遠，六爺轉灣抹角怱怱地在雨裏走着，已經到了。在門口聽到六爺的大少爺蓮孫高聲地說着，「只要有錢賺，管他日本不日本，愛國熱心都不騙人哪！」又聽到三房的大少爺桂孫也高聲地話着，「眞是冷血動物！東三省可以亡，整個中國就可以亡，只管賺錢不管國亡，做亡國奴有什麽好處？」又聽見蓮孫說，「冷血動物也好，亡國奴也好，我不拘人家駡！」六爺掩了紙傘兒走過走廊到了書房門口，咳嗽了一聲，然後進去。蓮孫和桂孫停了爭論都從椅子上面站起身相迎，呌聲，</p>
<p>「六叔，請坐！」</p>
<p>蓮孫已經是三十多歲了，圓臉大嘴，模樣兒很像他爺，只是還没有留鬍子。桂孫也是三十内外的人，却長得像隻猴子。六爺平常對於這兩個侄兒是許稱不還的。都能幹，一個在汕頭開布行，一個在城裏開糖棧。六爺坐定以後，先問蓮孫侄兒說，「幾時從汕頭回家的？」蓮孫應說「今天。」又問桂孫侄兒說，「這幾天有進糖没有？」桂孫回說，「不能夠再進了。汕頭的糖行在香港買了日未糖化成糖水，裝鐵箱冒報香港糖水進口，然後過爐賣出，特别便宜，什麽糖都受了打擊，一跌幾塊錢，看還跌呢？」六爺心裏明白他們剛才爭論的原因。不願意再聽他們的爭論就不問不下去，回頭問蓮孫說，「你爹那裏去？」蓮孫回說，「到後面去。就來的。六叔烟舖上抽大烟。」</p>

<p>(Beiping) Road News: At various stations along the Jin-Yu (Tianjin-Shanhaiguan) and Beining (Beiping-Shenyang) lines, the Japanese garrison troops have increased by a dozen or so soldiers at each station since Umetsu took office, responsible for guarding the railway. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Miyun News: The puppet state recently established a Rehe Province Xinglong County Customs Collection Office in Xinglong County, and all goods passing through are required to pay taxes. Peanuts are taxed at a rate of 2.8 yuan per hundred catties. The goods of businesses in the county town have all been inspected and assessed for taxation by personnel sent by the office, and the merchants and people are all suffering. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain Japanese inspection group came to China for inspection. On the 12th, when they took the Beining No. 8 train to Tianjin and passed through Tangshan, the Japanese military police and garrison troops temporarily imposed martial law at the station. Our Public Security Bureau police and passengers were not allowed to enter the station. The situation was as if facing a formidable enemy. The martial law was lifted only after the train departed. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Shanhaiguan garrison troops are building a Yuguan Victory Monument in front of the Japanese elementary school in the South Gate City Pass, describing the achievements of their invasion of our Yuguan. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A large number of Japanese military supplies continue to arrive in Malanyu, all piled up at the residence of Zhuan Ziyi. Zhang Haipeng, the commander of the puppet army's engineering battalion, went to the area to inspect and left after two days. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong told reporters that a small team of Japanese soldiers, belonging to the Asami unit of the Tangshan Japanese garrison troops, was discovered in Zunhua and Fengrun, investigating traces of battles. We were notified in advance. A large number of Japanese troops were deployed to Malanyu, but the provincial authorities have not received confirmation. It is probably not true, as Japanese troops are frequently moved, leading people to suspect an increase. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Youxun is scheduled to return to Gubeikou on the 14th, and Huo Shiding on the 15th. Chaisan is scheduled to travel to Suiyuan and Baotou with Nishite and Sakamura on the morning of the 14th, returning to Beiping on the 18th. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Xiaoyi said that the Malanyu takeover issue is not hopeless. The Japanese side intends to continue negotiations after Huang Fu returns to Beiping. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Postal and Transportation Issues <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Sources say that the biggest goal of the Japanese request for postal and transportation links is to induce us to recognize the puppet state in fact. However, the side effects are: 1. Japan is plotting to complete the Northeast railway network, but the section outside Shanhaiguan of the Beining Railway has a British loan relationship. Japan intends to buy it from Britain and implement it after the transportation links are realized. 2. After we blocked Northeast postal services, the puppet state established its own postal service, employing 2,050 postal workers, of which 420 are Japanese, 200 are Koreans, and about 60 are White Russians. Since its opening until the end of last year, it has lost 600,000 yuan, so it is urgently seeking to restore postal links to remedy the situation. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Japanese military attaché Taniguchi said that the Japanese embassy has not received any report about General Araki's visit to China, but Araki is a military councillor, and if he travels or inspects abroad, it must be approved by the Japanese Emperor. His movements are quite restricted, so it is considered unlikely. Military attaché Chaisan's trip to Shanxi is purely for sightseeing, and he is expected to return to Beiping around the 18th. The rumors that foreign envoys will travel to Shandong and other places are not true. The takeover of Malanyu is expected to be unproblematic, he said. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 13th, the members, considering that the situation in North China is changing rapidly under Japanese control, and that the diplomatic response is currently being studied meticulously by the central government, agreed that they should also consider the matter at length. They continued to hold a discussion group meeting, which was held in secret as usual. As a result, they decided to hand it over to the Foreign Affairs Committee to organize and draft a memorandum of opinions, which would be submitted to the general assembly for approval and then sent to the central government for reference.

<p>(Nanjing) A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the rumors that China and Japan will hold a Far East conference on the Northeast Incident based on the recommendations of the Lytton Report and the resolutions of the League of Nations, under the supervision of the League of Nations, and inviting the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to participate, are unfounded and are a misrepresentation.

<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng went from Tong County to Yutian on the morning of the 13th to handle the dismissal of the police force and thoroughly rectify the security forces. Before leaving, he sent a long telegram to Huang Fu, reporting everything. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng telegraphed the provincial government on the 13th, reporting that he would go from Tong County to Yutian to reorganize the special police force, dismissing 900 men first and then 400 men. The Hebei provincial government has issued Yutian reorganization funds twice. The Political Affairs Committee reluctantly paid 10,000 for supplies. The provincial authorities are currently maintaining calm and waiting for Yin Rugeng to handle it. If Yin's handling is unsuccessful, other methods will be used. The 8,000-strong war zone security force compiled by the Hebei provincial government has been compiled and is scheduled to be deployed to the war zone within two months, distributed to various counties. If Feng Shoushan's unit in Yutian does not listen to reorganization, the security force compiled by the province can monitor the unit and force it to shrink. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The remnants of Sun Dianying's army, the Yang Monkey Kid bandits, more than a thousand strong, were discovered on the 12th between Baochang and Dolun in Chahar. Song Zheyuan has ordered the garrison troops in Baochang to intercept and suppress them. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Guihua telegram: Because the Suiyuan army's armored vehicle team arrived to encircle and suppress them at Zhaohe, Yang Monkey Kid's bandits plan to flee east to the key passes in eastern Suiyuan.

The headquarters has also sent Councillor Liu Chengyuan to Bailing Temple to explain to the banner the situation of the Suiyuan army suppressing bandits and protecting the temple. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan received a telegram from Zhang Zuoyi requesting that Yang Monkey Kid's bandits are indeed colluding with Li Shouxin's puppet army in eastern Chahar.

<p>(Jinan) This afternoon, the Liu bandits fled back to the Wulian Mountains from Sanguan. At 3:00 PM, they fled east again. The aim seems to still be Haikou. Li Xuande's regiment advanced from the north of Liushudian, Wu Yuanxing from the east of Majiazhuang, and Ma Guanyi's brigade from the southwest of Jietou, pursuing along different routes. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Liu bandits sneaked into the Laojuntang area of the Wulian Mountains, 70 miles south of Zhucheng, last night. This morning, they fled southwest to the Honghe Sanguan area, 50 miles north of Rizhao city. Because Tang Bangzhi and Ma Guanyi's two brigades took cars to deploy defenses along the Juxian to Rizhao road, the bandits could not flee south and returned to the Wulian Mountains. Li Xuande's cavalry regiment and Wu Yuanxing's regiment are in hot pursuit. Central government airplanes bombed the Linzhushan in Zhucheng yesterday, killing more than 100 bandits. The Wulian Mountains are quite dangerous and have a road leading to Guangming Temple, which has more than 100 monks and is heavily defended. There are no bandit traces in the Hongshiya area of Jiaoxian. Today, Zhan Shutang led his division and transported its Chang brigade back to Jinan. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han said that after clearing the Liu bandits, he will set off to inspect the upper reaches of the Yellow River. After the Shitoukoumen is blocked, the water level in the counties of Puyang, Fanxian, Shouzhang, and Yanggu in this province will drop, and the land has been spring ploughed. The Lin Binghai regiment of the bandit suppression army has also returned to Jinan today. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yangzhou) Wang Depu, the Copper Mountain District Supervisory Commissioner, is on patrol in the counties of Xuzhou. Because Pizhou is connected to Shandong territory, the Liu bandits have been fleeing uncertainly recently, and local self-defense is extremely important. He took a car east on the 13th and first went to Pizhou to inspect, followed by other counties. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Captain Li of the Marine Corps and Deputy Regiment Commander Qin of the Defense Regiment telegraphed the municipal government that because the provincial army was pursuing and suppressing them, the Liu bandits had no gaps to take advantage of along the coast and fled to Baoliao Ridge, 60 miles south of Zhucheng, at noon on the 12th, and then fled to the Chaohe River on the border between Rizhao and Zhucheng. A naval airplane flew over Hongshiya Wangtai and other places at noon on the 13th to scout and confirmed that there were no bandit traces. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Xu Kangliang and others still flew airplanes to eastern Shandong on the morning of the 13th to scout and saw the Liu bandits in the Taohuashan and Ma'ershan areas, surrounded by the Shandong army dispatched from Zhucheng and Juxian. They then dropped bombs and bombed them. The bandits were scurrying around at the foot of the mountain and had no way out in all directions. Many were killed and wounded. They returned to Xuzhou in the afternoon. The Shandong army is still besieging them. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Cheng Xixian arrived in Beiping from Jinan on the morning of the 13th and reported to He Yingqin on the recent situation of the Shandong army's advance in suppressing the Liu bandits. The Shandong-Han telegram reported that the remnants of the Liu bandits fled east north of Zhucheng, reaching the vicinity of Xiaoshaopo south of Lincun. They were surrounded and attacked. The remaining bandits numbered less than 400, and there were no more than 300 horses, causing them to flee southwest. It is planned here to suppress the bandits to the coast within Zhucheng territory and annihilate them. Shen Honglie has been telegraphed to block ships near Hongshiya from landing to prevent them from fleeing to the Jiaozhou coast, colluding with foreigners, and replenishing weapons and ammunition. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Zhou Xiuzhong and Zhao Jianzhen of the Central Air Force bombing squadron flew aircraft No. 65, and Xu Kangliang flew aircraft No. 66. They took off from Xuzhou at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 13th one after another. Aircraft No. 66 was damaged and needed repair, making it unsuitable for combat, so it landed in Linyi. Zhou and Zhao flew aircraft No. 65 around Toutangji, Juxian, Ma'ershan, Shenshui and Liangcheng Shigouya to scout and discovered the remnants of the Liu bandits. They immediately dropped bombs and bombed them. After flying back to Linyi to refuel, they installed bombs. Xu Kangliang then changed aircraft and flew to Taohuashan, where he discovered that the Liu bandits were surrounded by the welcoming and suppressing troops and pursuing troops of the Shandong army. The bandits were greatly defeated. They fled west first and are now turning back and fleeing to the northeast mountaintop. The mountains are full of bandits, and they are in a desperate situation. Xu dropped five bombs, four of which hit, killing and wounding 50 or 60 bandit soldiers and horses. They fled in panic and were in a state of extreme distress. On the Juxian to Rizhao Avenue, hundreds of cars were seen, transporting soldiers to meet and attack. If the bandits flee east again, they will be blocked by the sea. Therefore, the Liu bandits are trapped in a heavy siege. After the air force bombs them every day, they will be annihilated.

<h3 id="e29">International Politics and the Anglo-American Relationship <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The future trend of international politics is nothing more than two paths: ⑴ Major powers continue to maintain the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and promote the relationship between these two major collective systems to cope with the new reality. ⑵ Major powers accelerate military preparations to support or destroy these two major collective systems and separately seek the expansion or safeguarding of their own rights.</p>
<p>The League of Nations organization is the backbone of the collective system. However, to realize its mission, it must possess two basic conditions: first, it must gather all major powers together; and second, it must have a method for implementing coercive measures against countries that violate the covenant. These two conditions are interrelated. The reason why the League of Nations has not fully met the expectations of the world in 1918 over the years is due to the unsatisfactory nature of the aforementioned relationship.</p>
<p>Today, the United Kingdom and its overseas self-governing colonies are committed to maintaining the status quo and are unwilling to make changes on their own. Therefore, they have not only signed the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact but have also participated in various international arbitration and reconciliation treaties, with few exceptions. In the future, after weighing the situation, they will voluntarily support these collective systems to carry out their original intentions. The United Kingdom believes that the key to the success or failure of the League of Nations in the future lies in the Disarmament Conference. To promote the progress of the Disarmament Conference, it is necessary to grant Germany "equality" and France "security." Therefore, on January 31 of this year, it announced the Disarmament Memorandum, proposing to combine the average adjustment of armaments with political security guarantees. It also made Germany's return to the League of Nations a necessary condition. These principles are beyond reproach. The difficulty lies in exercising the authority to implement sanctions when there are violations of these principles. The true value of sanctions can only be revealed through collective action by all countries. Otherwise, if only one or two countries are responsible for sanctions, the effect will be equal to zero. Sometimes, being too hasty may lead to war.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is speculated that the future diplomatic policy of the United Kingdom must aim to win over the member states of the League of Nations and the signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Among them, the attitude of the United States is the focus of its attention. However, the United States is reluctant to be involved in the whirlpool of Europe and Asia and tie itself up. Looking at the propositions of responsible personnel in recent years, the most distinctive ones are Stinson's declaration in August 1932 and Davis's speech in May 1933. However, according to the expressions of the two gentlemen, at most, they only mean that after the disarmament convention is signed, if there is a violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in the international community, and all countries and the United States unanimously determine that so-and-so is a violator, then when all countries jointly sanction the country, the United States will abandon its wartime neutrality rights.</p>
<p>However, there is a limit to the United States' desire to avoid being surrounded by the god of war. According to actual experience, in a world war situation, countries with significant international commercial interests, such as the United States, will not be willing to abandon their wartime neutrality rights as Stinson and Davis said, so as to lose the opportunity to get rich quickly. However, it must also be unable to carry out its neutrality rights while strictly maintaining neutrality. For the United States, if it does not want to be involved in the whirlpool of the European and Asian war, and wants to preserve its neutrality rights, then the only way is to find a way to limit the scope of the war to be localized, and not allow it to expand. However, this is only possible if the United Kingdom maintains neutrality at the same time. If the United Kingdom joins the war and the United States is unwilling to abandon its neutrality rights, it will eventually conflict with the United Kingdom. Because of the close relationship between the two countries in terms of geography, history, and national interests, their future peace and war plans will be mutually beneficial if they unite, and mutually harmful if they separate. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>However, it is difficult for the United Kingdom to accommodate the United States and take the same steps in the next international war to maintain neutrality. The United Kingdom and its self-governing colonies are member states of the League of Nations, and the British government is also a signatory to the Locarno Treaty. Therefore, it cannot remain neutral in European disputes like the United States.</p>
<p>In short, an Anglo-American war is the most feared by the people of both countries. However, looking at the future trend of international politics, it is not entirely impossible. To prevent this war from breaking out, from the British standpoint, the United States must jointly shoulder the responsibility of maintaining peace. From the American standpoint, the United Kingdom must jointly adopt a conservative neutrality policy. They go in opposite directions and do not conspire with each other. We deeply feel that if the Geneva Disarmament Conference fails, the Anglo-American relationship will be the key to whether the subsequent international war expands or not. At that time, the United Kingdom should convene an imperial conference to exchange opinions between the mother country and the self-governing colonies and determine its policy towards the United States.</p>

<p>Miami City. Roosevelt, on a yacht, fished and traveled around the Bahamas for two weeks. Now that his vacation is over, he has taken a special train from here to return to Washington, D.C. to resume his administration. (12th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Miami. President Roosevelt passed through here today and went straight back to Washington. He narrowly escaped misfortune on the way, no different from escaping death. According to those who told people afterward, they still had lingering fears. Roosevelt landed from the dock today and went straight to the station to board the special train. Among those who accompanied him were General Johnson, the Director of the Reconstruction Office, and Li Mai, the secretary, as well as many White House correspondents. They were all in a large car driving straight to the station. Unexpectedly, a train suddenly came at a crossroads. The two cars were almost close to colliding. Fortunately, the train driver came to his senses and hurriedly turned the train into another track. The large car was spared from the disaster. According to reporters, Roosevelt's face has turned dark after two weeks of fishing, because it was exposed to the sun and heat. (12th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The important issues that President Roosevelt will encounter after returning to the White House tomorrow are tariffs, silver, taxes, and the Exchange Management Act. The most important action in the Senate in the two weeks since President Roosevelt's trip was the legislation to formulate the budget case for independent agencies, to restore salary cuts and veterans' pensions, and to defeat the president's veto. According to administrative leaders, the president feels that the country must increase tax revenue to make up for the burden on the government since the enactment of that law. Whether the government authorities are satisfied with the tax bills in the Senate and the House of Representatives is still uncertain. Although ordinary administrative policies can be exercised without hindrance, there may be changes due to the increase in veterans' pensions and official salaries. The Silver Act, which President Roosevelt requested the current Congress to postpone, is still on the horizon in Congress. The Senate has now completed the mixed silver bill that gathers the major clauses in the Dais case, the Weiler amendment, and the Thomas plan. There is a good chance that the case will pass. The "Phillips-Rayburn" Exchange Management Act, which President Roosevelt regards as an important plan, will soon be voted on by the two houses. The House of Representatives' state subcommittee amended the case today and determined a minimum margin of 40%, which is 15% less than the original case. The minimum margin and the management agency established by the government are the main points of contention between the opposing and supporting parties in the case. The progress of the tariff case has not been as fast as the government had hoped. The case has not yet been voted on by the two houses. The original intention of the case was to authorize President Roosevelt to sign reciprocal trade agreements with foreign countries. (12th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) A fierce battle between the Senate and President Roosevelt will break out soon. There are three bills in Congress, all supported by the two houses, that will undermine President Roosevelt's plan to avoid lowering the price of the dollar. The first is the Dais case, which conflicts with the government's policy of not starting the silver issue until the results of the plan to reduce the gold composition of the dollar are fully ascertained. The second is the McLeod case, which advocates that the government should compensate for deposits of less than $2,500 in banks that closed after January 1930, which amounts to hundreds of millions. Depositors are now writing to members of Congress, asking for assistance. Because Congress will have elections in the fall, members tend to show favor to depositors. The third is the Frazier-Lemke case, which advocates providing financial assistance for rural mortgages. If this case passes, the government will inevitably issue hundreds of millions of paper money. Although the public believes that the case has almost no hope of being passed, it is known that President Roosevelt will veto it.</p>

<p>(Washington) Bella, an advisor to the Senate Banking Committee, recently sent blank forms to brokers on the exchange, asking them to fill in item by item the names of those who buy and sell silver and trade silver speculation, the inventory of each household, and its position in the market. According to the current Senate's advocacy of minting silver coins, it seems that it has decided to fight openly with President Roosevelt. Therefore, some people believe that this investigation seems to be authorized by government personnel who oppose the minting of silver coins, so as to understand who will profit after the minting of silver coins, and then there can be an excuse to deal with those who generally advocate the minting of silver coins.

<p>Eighteen thousand automobile parts workers in Detroit are dissatisfied with the procedures adopted by the Labor Bureau and have threatened to strike at midnight tonight if their demands for reduced working hours and increased wages are not met. Labor leaders and representatives from the Reconstruction Office have been working hard in the past 48 hours to try to resolve this dispute, but to no avail. Typists, letter carriers, elevator operators, and others have started striking today, as if an epidemic is spreading. The labor climate is getting worse, and it is feared that the authorities' efforts in the last five minutes may not be able to reverse the labor strike tonight.</p>
<p>Three thousand eight hundred workers from forty-five automobile parts factories in Detroit City have started striking since midnight this morning. Also, the Nash automobile factory in Qwashacheng, Wisconsin, has resumed work after a six-week strike. (12th Havas Telegram)</p>

The situation in the Alabama coal mining area is particularly tense. Some miners who are willing to resume work have been shot by strikers. The president of the United Mine Workers of America openly threatened that if the mine owners still do not comply with the Economic Recovery Administration's methods of reducing working hours and increasing wages, they will not hesitate to cause internal unrest, and declared that the miners are all prepared and can listen to the President's dispatch with 20 divisions of armed workers within 15 days to force the mine owners to concede and allow the minimum wage set by the Reconstruction Office.

<p>Pottsville. In Pottsville, Pennsylvania, USA, today, thousands of taxpayers were angry because the tax assessment was too high, some as high as three times the original. The property valuation committee refused to hold a public inquiry. They broke open the money door of the committee room, forcibly dragged the committee members into the public inquiry room, smashed all the glass windows, overturned the tables and desks, and trampled on the committee members. The situation began to ease slightly after the police suppressed it. The committee members were extremely frightened and finally agreed to listen to the statements of the 12 district delegations. The taxpayers were satisfied and dispersed. (12th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Former Secretary of State Stimson delivered a speech at Princeton University today, strongly urging the United States to join the League of Nations, saying that the American people are most capable of sympathizing, having courage and providing assistance to the world in the important struggles of the world without feeling difficulties or taking risks, so as to protect public civilization and stop war. The League of Nations represents European politicians directly preserving Europe and indirectly preserving the world, with meticulous efforts to avoid the harm of new wars. If we must want our government not to be involved in foreign affairs and not to participate in the peaceful efforts of other countries in the world, then we will eventually encounter a fact, that is, the strength of peace organizations will be weakened, and mankind will often encounter war. Not only will other countries in the world be harmed, but the United States and its civilization will also be poisoned. (12th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) Various groups supporting the International Federation of Associations held a conference today. Lord Cecil, the former British representative to the League of Nations, attended and delivered a speech, saying, "The reason why the League of Nations has developed into the current crisis phenomenon is not due to the imperfections of the League of Nations' own system, but because it is not used properly. Workers who are not skilled often blame the disadvantages of the equipment. The criticism of the League of Nations is the same. Today, the world is encountering difficulties, but the only reason is that members of the League of Nations already have a peace organization, but they do not know how to remove private opinions and use it sincerely and practically. Even our United Kingdom cannot avoid this criticism." In the afternoon, the Federation also held a conference at the Guildhall to discuss international cooperation to prevent aggression. Former Foreign Secretary Chamberlain delivered a speech. What he understood was slightly different from Lord Cecil. Cecil expressed trust in the League of Nations. Chamberlain discussed the League of Nations issue from another perspective. Chamberlain clearly advocated common international cooperation to safeguard security by stern means. Chamberlain put forward a resolution, which stated, "If a member of the League of Nations is subjected to unreasonable aggression, other member states should rise up to defend it." The meeting was enthusiastically applauded. Chamberlain continued to say that he was not unaware that some people in the United Kingdom only wanted the United Kingdom to close itself off and not have anything to do with the European continent. However, under the current situation, this isolationism is no different from "ostriches encountering danger, being frightened and burying their heads in the sand, but ultimately unable to escape the bullets of hunters. Our England has the right not to ask about foreign affairs, but the three birds of England are separated from the European continent by a water. When war breaks out in Europe, can we not be affected?" Chamberlain then said, "To safeguard British interests, there is no better way than to determine our attitude in advance. The attitude that the United Kingdom should take is to jointly prevent war. If the United Kingdom wants to seek security, Sun Li (isolation) cannot solve the problem. The effective method is still to recognize the aggressor as an enemy of all mankind." When Chamberlain said this, the meeting applauded thunderously. Chamberlain finally said, "The world organization we hope for has already sprouted since the establishment of the League of Nations. We should move forward to this goal carefully. No matter how far away the realization of our ideals is, we should not be disappointed, nor should we abandon our long-held purpose." (12th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) In order to quickly and satisfactorily resolve the stalled negotiations on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway and restore friendly relations between Russia and Japan, Foreign Minister Hirota is actively mediating between Russia and Manchuria and supervising the "Manchukuo" side to draft the Chinese Eastern Railway transfer case to be submitted. If this case can be completed in time, the Foreign Minister will make it be submitted at the luncheon at the Foreign Minister's official residence at noon on the 14th. The luncheon will be the first consultation for the reopening of the transfer negotiations. If the Soviet Union expresses its sincerity when the "Manchukuo" side submits the case, it is believed that there is a possibility that the transfer negotiations will be resolved quickly. The attendees of the luncheon are: on the host side, Foreign Minister Hirota, Vice Minister Shigemitsu, Director of the Information Department Amou, Director of the European and American Bureau Togo, and Chief of the First European and American Section; on the "Manchukuo" side, Ding Tuyuan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Oohashi, and Foreign Affairs Officer Sugihara; on the Soviet side, Ambassador Yurelev, Counselor Raphael, and Kazinovsky. If the proposal of the "Manchukuo" side can be submitted on time as the Foreign Minister expects, then this meeting will be the same as the first meeting for the start of the transfer negotiations on June 26 last year, and will be a historical event.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the date of the upcoming conference, after consultations between the Japanese Ambassador to the Netherlands, Mr. Taketomi, and the Dutch Foreign Minister, Mr. Graaf, it has now been decided to hold it on May 19th in Batavia.

<p>(Tokyo) The attitude of the Dutch East Indies toward the Japan-Netherlands conference has gradually shifted towards a cooperative direction, based on subsequent telegrams from the Foreign Ministry and information from various sources. The issue of the Batavia system, initially considered the main problem, is, in fact, about the Dutch East Indies seeking to ascertain how much more Java sugar Japan can import. They are not immediately demanding an increase in sugar imports to Japan starting this year, but rather considering a plan for a progressive increase. Furthermore, the Dutch East Indies plans to grant special privileges to Dutch merchants for all goods imported into the Dutch East Indies, aiming to control imports. This point is noteworthy.

<p>(London) According to a report in the Daily Herald, regarding the Anglo-Japanese cotton industry dispute, when the President of the Board of Trade, Mr. Runciman, speaks with the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Mr. Matsumoto, he will propose a suggestion. As a new basis for Anglo-Japanese cooperation, the most important point is that Japan agrees to limit the total amount of its cotton textile exports to a certain quantity, and Britain, in turn, agrees not to increase tariffs on Japanese goods. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Since the breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese cotton industry negotiations, it is now even more doubtful whether the British government intends to resume trade negotiations with Japan immediately. According to impressions obtained by the Department of Trade, there is no hope that the negotiations held recently will produce results. The opinion of the Department of Trade is that, instead of making fruitless efforts to establish an unpredictable agreement, it is better to protect British industry from further encroachment by Japanese goods. Therefore, when the next budget案 is submitted to the House of Commons, it may include protective measures for industry. These protective measures have long been demanded, but never achieved, by the majority of members of the Conservative Party. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>

<p>(London) The British Foreign Office has received Germany's reply to Britain's inquiry regarding the increase in its military spending. It is currently being considered by Foreign Secretary Simon and will probably be announced in the House of Commons within a few days. Judging from the opinions of German newspapers, the German government believes that the increase in military spending is very justifiable. Replacing single-engine aircraft with twin-engine aircraft requires enormous expenses, and the amount listed in the current air force budget is not large. As for the army, Germany plans to reorganize the National Defense Force according to a shorter conscription system, which also requires significant expenses. Germany also has the right to replace old ships with new ships. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(London) After Germany increased its military spending, the British government instructed the British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Eric Phipps, to inquire with the German Foreign Office about the reasons for the increase in German military spending. The German government's reply to the British government was received here this morning. The content of the reply is being studied in detail and appears to be largely the same as the reasons given orally by the German Foreign Minister, Baron von Neurath, to the British Ambassador, namely: 1) The increase in army spending is due to the renewal required by changing over to a professional army; 2) The increase in air force spending is due to the renewal of civil aviation and the original engine</p>

<p>Brussels: Belgium is currently clearly expressing opposition to the Fascist Party. Since the death of former King Albert and the accession of the new monarch, Leopold III, a change in the political environment shows that the support of the Belgian Socialist Party for the new monarch is a guarantee against dictatorship and fascism. It is noteworthy that, when the former King Albert ascended the throne, the Socialist Party vehemently opposed him. However, since the succession of the new monarch, Leopold, it has been discovered that a united Socialist Party supports the continued existence of a constitutional monarchy. In addition to Socialist leader Vandervelde giving a eulogy to the former king, the Central Committee of the Socialist Party, representing the majority of the people, also voted to participate in the parliamentary address to the new monarch. The form of the address is a kind of speech after the new monarch's accession, implying the goals and hopes of the Belgian people in uniting to support the monarch and the constitution. Socialist members hope that, by participating in the address, they can consolidate constitutional government and avoid possible oppression by Fascism, as Fascism has not yet officially formed a political party. Vandervelde and other Socialist members explained that their opposition to the rule of the late King Albert was solely due to social injustice. However, Vandervelde and others also solemnly declared that Albert was truly the most democratic of monarchs and was able to implement social legislation, allowing the people to enjoy equal rights. Therefore, Socialist members are prepared to assist the constitutionally impartial heir to the throne. (National News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e58">Difficulty in Selecting Successor After Resignation of Army Minister Lin; Contradiction Between Peaceful Diplomacy and Militarism; Prince Kan'in Returns to Capital Early for Final Decision <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the resignation of Army Minister Lin, the Army Ministry officials say that it is awaiting the decision of Chief of the General Staff Prince Kan'in after he returns to the capital. However, in reality, this is a way to delay the matter because it is difficult to select a successor internally. It is rumored that Araki's reinstatement is unlikely to materialize because Foreign Minister Hirota is currently working hard to promote peaceful diplomacy with the United States. Would it not be a contradiction if Araki's militarism were to be realized again? However, the military has expressed dissatisfaction with Army Minister Lin, believing that he cannot continue Araki's tough policies, and internally, there is actually no one who can succeed Araki. This is why it is difficult to select a successor. The financial and political circles are well aware of this fact within the military and are secretly promoting Lieutenant General Koiso Kuniaki, the former Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army and current commander of the 5th Division, to become the Army Minister. This is because Lieutenant General Koiso has some economic knowledge and is also relatively well-informed about the world situation. However, Lieutenant General Koiso lacks the power to control the current military, so this promotion is probably difficult to achieve. At 8:50 this morning, Army Minister Lin went to his official residence. Vice Minister Yanagawa and Commander of the Military Police Qin had a long, confidential discussion with Army Minister Lin. At 10:20, he went to the Prime Minister's official residence to participate in the regular cabinet meeting. (Chinese United News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito is deeply concerned that the resignation of Army Minister Lin will affect the fate of the cabinet, so he is making every effort to persuade Lin Senjuro to stay. However, Lin's intention to resign is firm, and it is imperative to convene a meeting of the heads of the Army Ministry, the General Staff Headquarters, the Inspectorate General of Military Education, and the Military Police Headquarters to make a decision after Chief of the General Staff Prince Kan'in returns to the capital tomorrow. The government is most concerned that General Araki Sadao will be reappointed as Army Minister, in which case the political parties and financial circles will inevitably launch a major movement to overthrow the cabinet. They are currently collecting information from various sources to prepare countermeasures. (Chinese United News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prince Kan'in, Chief of the General Staff, who is returning to the capital early due to the Army Minister's resignation, departed from Tokushima at 9:00 p.m. today, boarded the Kyodo Maru at Komatsushima at 10:00 p.m., landed in Osaka at 5:00 a.m. on the 14th, and traveled by car to Kyoto. He will depart from Kyoto Station eastbound at 1:00 p.m. and arrive at Tokyo Station at 9:00 p.m. On the 15th, although it is Sunday, he will still grant an audience to Army Minister Lin, hold a meeting of the three top army officials, and decide on the resignation of Army Minister Lin and the successor to the Army Minister. All official procedures will be completed on the 16th. (Denstu News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>

<p>Deer Antler Extract Contains a Large Amount of Male Endocrine Substance Which Can Enhance the Vitality of the Body and Has a Significant Effect on Curing Wasting Diseases</p>
<h3 id="e60">Results of Research by Russian Medical Community <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>TASS Moscow, March 13th Dispatch: For thousands of years, Chinese doctors have always used deer antler (the engorged young horns of spotted deer) as a famous medicine. The Soviet medical community has recently become quite interested in this. The Soviet Fur and Hunting Society accepted the suggestion of the famous scientist Pavlovlenko and conducted scientific tests on the medicinal properties of this substance. This work was carried out under the guidance of Pavlovlenko. Pavlovlenko has already extracted the most medicinal substance from deer antler, calling it deer antler extract. Several prominent scientists and doctors from Moscow hospitals are proving the medicinal properties of this new substance. After analysis, it is known that deer antler extract contains a large amount of male endocrine substance, which has aroused strong interest in medical theory and practice. After hospital experiments, this substance has a high degree of medicinal power, namely it can enhance the vitality of the body, the activity of the heart, and eliminate the weakness of the heart muscle, etc. It can also accelerate the healing of friction injuries and is most effective for injuries that have been infected or festered. After many patients took deer antler extract, their workload and appetite immediately increased. Those who were disabled became less indifferent and nervous. This substance is also very effective for certain gastrointestinal diseases and sclerosis. In the second half of this year, Soviet hospitals will widely apply deer antler extract. Currently, the spotted deer farm of the Coastal Province Far East Livestock Mixed Ranch has 10,000 spotted deer. Two more deer farms will be added to the area this year to raise spotted deer.</p>

Further inquiries were made to the Ministry of Communications to find out what happened. According to Wei Yifu, Director of the Postal Department, after our blockade of the Northeast postal service, the counterfeit national postal service was completely managed by the Japanese. All mail from the people of the Northeast to destinations outside the counterfeit nation is handled and forwarded by the Japanese post office. If our post office receives mail from Japan and finds that it has counterfeit national stamps affixed to it, it will naturally be treated as invalid based on the principle of non-recognition. The post office will then notify the addressee and impose a penalty in accordance with the regulations on insufficient postage, requiring them to pay the penalty to redeem the letter. The policy of absolutely prohibiting our country's mail from being sent to the counterfeit nation has been consistent for two years. (Special dispatch from the 13th)</p>

<p>Ministry Has Not Received Reports of British and French Invasion of Yunnan</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to reports, King Hu Yu-shan of Ban Hong has already engaged in battle with British troops three times and is currently in a stalemate. Furthermore, the French troops have occupied E’ha Village. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs attaches great importance to this situation as it is closely related to border defense. On the 13th, reporters inquired with the relevant agencies. According to officials from the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as of noon today, they had not yet received any reports on the matter and had already telegraphed the Yunnan Provincial Government to inquire about the truth. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the British entered Ban Hong on the Yunnan border, investigations and negotiations are underway. Suddenly, the Jian Shui County Party Department sent a telegram stating that in February, 150 to 160 armed French soldiers suddenly invaded Zhong Meng and completely occupied E’la Village, requesting national support. However, as of the afternoon of the 13th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet received a telegram from the Yunnan Provincial Government regarding this matter. Li Pei-tian, the representative of the Yunnan Provincial Government in Beijing, is currently not in Beijing and cannot be questioned. Based on the telegram from the Jian Shui County Party Department, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specifically telegraphed Long Yun, Chairman of Yunnan, and Wang Zhan-qi, Special Diplomatic Commissioner, urging them to quickly investigate and report back for negotiations. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Ban Hong incident, the first colonial commissioner stationed in Simao, Li Yue-gai, and the second colonial commissioner stationed in Tengchong County, Yang Yi-qian, have personally gone to Ban Hong to investigate. Li and Yang have already departed and a more detailed report is expected in Beijing in about two weeks. Yunnan Chairman Long Yun believes that the British are exploiting the pro-British minority indigenous people in Ban Hong to assist in mining, while the majority of indigenous people are resisting, leading to a war between indigenous people. Long has dispatched special commissioner Lu Guo-fan to Ban Hong to sincerely comfort the indigenous people. Lu has been a local chieftain in Yunnan for many years and is highly trusted by the indigenous people. Kunming has a special diplomatic commissioner, Wang Zhan-qi, and Yangon has a consul, Xu Cong-yun. The British also have a diplomatic commissioner stationed in Yangon and a British consul in Kunming. In addition to reporting the Ban Hong situation to the central government, the Yunnan provincial authorities have also notified Wang Zhan-qi (Nanjing) and Xu Cong-yun to negotiate with the British consuls and commissioners nearby, taking a two-pronged approach: 1. Before the Yunnan-Myanmar border is surveyed and demarcated, the British should cease mining in Ban Hong. 2. China and Britain should each send commissioners to jointly survey and demarcate the Yunnan-Myanmar border. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>(Jinan) A production and sales cooperative for Boshan coal mines has been established. Forty articles of association have been agreed upon, named the Shandong East Coal Mine Cooperative Company. All participating mine operators will have their external sales managed by the company. Each coal mine will transport all types of coal produced to the nearest railway station and hand it over to the cooperative company for joint sale. The company's capital is set at 300,000 yuan, which will be allocated and paid according to the proportion of actual coal production of each mine. The company will be organized and established within one month after the agreement is signed and will begin operations. The company will have three supervisors, nine review committee members, a coal quality inspection committee, and a coal production review committee. It will also apply to the Department of Construction, planning to mortgage all mineral properties and mining rights of the mine operators to the banking sector for 1.5 million yuan. It is estimated that 4,000 tons of coal can be produced daily, with a levy of 5 jiao per ton, which can be repaid in about two years. Yu Wu-heng, a technical specialist from the Department of Construction, returned to Jinan on the 12th to report to Zhang Hong-lie.

<p>Japanese Garrison in Tangshan Conducts Live-Fire Exercises</p>
<p>Chairman of the Gubeikou Chamber of Commerce a Traitor</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the counties in eastern Luan and northern Ji have been designated as war zones, Japanese and Korean ronin and general traitors, under the protection of the Japanese, have been carrying out activities on a large scale, ostensibly establishing foreign firms to secretly sell various drugs and smuggle firearms, which are resold to local bandits. As a result, general riffraff and local ruffians also have secret meeting places. Bandits are rising up, and robberies occur frequently. The Japanese army also conducts live-fire exercises from time to time to demonstrate force, causing the local people to feel uneasy and living under a cloud of terror. Not only are the traitors still trying to be active, but the Japanese army's troop movements are also particularly active.</p>
<p>News that the Japanese army in Gubeikou would be transferred to Zunhua and Fengrun counties had been widely circulated. However, most people still thought it was unreliable and were half-believing, half-doubting. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 8th of this month, more than 30 Japanese soldiers took 16 heavy trucks, carrying military supplies such as guns and ammunition, and drove into Fengrun city. When asked about their intentions, they said they were visiting education and construction in the county. The Japanese soldiers also brought cameras and measuring instruments, the purpose of which is unclear. Because of the chaos of last year, local merchants and residents have become easily frightened, rumors are rife, and people are restless, with a feeling that they may not survive.</p>
<p>The Japanese garrison in Tangshan had always notified our Public Security Bureau in advance to inform merchants and residents of the previous exercises, so that they would not be alarmed and could maintain local order. However, during the period when the city was under serious alert due to the resolution of the labor strike in Tangshan and the search for reactionary elements, the team suddenly conducted live-fire exercises at the old shooting range in Xishan from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th without prior notice. For a time, people were in a panic, thinking that an incident had occurred. Fortunately, order was gradually restored through the maintenance of the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Lu Tai, Zhaishang, Hangu, Zhakou and other places in Ninghe County are prosperous commercial towns and have long been areas of activity for traitors. This time, a large number of recruited poor peasants from those areas were transported to Guanjie by way of Qinhuangdao. Upon receiving the report, the Ninghe Public Security Bureau led the police and the security regiment to surround the Tianjiazhuang in the South Railway Station and arrested the traitors Zhang Yichun, Liu Mingqing, and Wang and others, a total of five people. They also seized many reactionary declarations and publications. There are still three people at large and are being hunted down.</p>
<p>Liu You-xun, the director of the Gubeikou Miyun Bureau, has come to Beiping from Gubeikou to visit Yin Rugeng, the administrative inspector of the Ji-Mi District, to report on government affairs. The reporter met with Liu, who said the following: Gubeikou has been relatively peaceful recently. The local population is currently about 5,000 people, mostly from other provinces. Since the Changcheng War, many people have lost their jobs and are forced by life to become traitors. Recently, in order to provide relief, the War Zone Committee has approved a spring relief program to provide 8,000 yuan to a small number of farmers to add farming tools and seeds to facilitate spring plowing. However, this money has not yet been released. The fake police at Nantianmen in Gubeikou have been allowed by the Japanese to withdraw within this month. It is still difficult to say whether this will be realized at that time. If there is no trouble from traitors in Gubeikou, it will not be difficult to restore the situation before the war in a short period of time. Zou Hong-en and Guan, the chairman and vice-chairman of the local chamber of commerce, have become traitors and have recently been re-elected. Li, who was the chairman of the chamber of commerce before the war, has succeeded them. After investigation, several places have been found where Japanese and Korean ronin are secretly selling opium and heroin. There are also local thugs who are selling drugs secretly in the name of the Japanese. The Bureau has decided to send personnel to take measures to ban them. (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Chiang Orders He Chengjun to Take Responsibility for Blocking Sichuan Bandits; He Returns to Hankou from Jiangxi and Then Goes to Northern Hubei for Inspection; an Administrative Office Will Be Established in Fancheng to Facilitate Command <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Chengjun, the appeasement commissioner stationed in Hubei, was previously ordered by General Chiang to go to northern Hubei for inspection, to arrange for blocking Sichuan bandits, and was offered the position of commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the border areas of the four provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Hubei. After He repeatedly declined, he gave up. However, He has clearly taken on the responsibility of suppressing bandits in that area. Therefore, the rumor that the appeasement office would move to northern Hubei is rampant. On the 2nd of this month, He left Hankou for Jiangxi and arrived in Nanchang on the 3rd. In eight days, he met with Chiang four times, reporting in detail on his inspection of northern Hubei and the suppression of the remaining bandits of Liu Guitang, Ma Xiyou, and Wang You. Chiang paid particular attention to preventing Sichuan bandits from fleeing to Hubei. It is said that he has commissioned He to continue to be responsible for the defense and has given instructions. After completing his official duties in Jiangxi, He and Qian Dajun, Wu Jiaxiang, and Pang Bingxun took a car to Xun on the 10th. On the 11th, He, Wu, and Pang took the Jiangxin steamer west. Qian Dajun stayed in Xun for one day on official business. After the Jiangxin steamer arrived in Hankou at 5:00 AM on the 12th, He went to the appeasement office to work and scheduled to visit Deputy Commander Zhang on the 13th, after which he will go to northern Hubei for inspection. The appeasement office has suspended its relocation and will establish an administrative office in Fancheng when necessary to facilitate command. According to He, "This time, I went to Jiangxi to report to General Chiang on the various matters of inspecting and suppressing bandits and to ask for instructions on blocking Sichuan bandits. General Chiang gave very detailed instructions. The bandit suppression military affairs in Hubei Province can be described in general terms. The remaining bandits in eastern Hubei have been surrounded and have been fleeing for too long, exhausted. We also have fresh troops joining the cooperation in suppression. It is only a matter of time before they are annihilated. There are few remaining bandits in southern Hubei, which is also easy to clear. The He bandits in western Hubei have now fled abroad, and scattered small groups are being searched and suppressed by Commander-in-Chief Xu Yuanquan. There are no traces of bandits in the central and northern Hubei regions. Local rehabilitation is still carried out according to the plan previously set by General Chiang, which needs to be implemented urgently. The cleanup and rehabilitation of the border areas of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and the command of the stationed troops, are still under the command of General Liu Zhenhua. The Xu Xiangqian bandit forces have been damaged in Sichuan and are inevitably forced to flee elsewhere, so defensive military affairs are more important. I plan to go to northern Hubei again within a few days to continue inspecting the blockhouse projects and traffic conditions in various counties in order to make proper arrangements, and then transfer to western Hubei for inspection, with the general goal of consolidating the border defense and maintaining local peace. The bandit suppression in Jiangxi has indeed made great progress. It will not be difficult to complete it within the three-month period set by General Chiang. The market in Nanchang has improved and the atmosphere is new. Because General Chiang is promoting the New Life Movement, the people have heard the style and have a vigorous spirit, which shows that this movement is indeed a need for today's Chinese society, and restoring inherent morality is enough to save the declining customs and revive the last customs. I passed by President Wang in the middle of the road when he went to Jiangxi, so I did not see him. I have also never been to Beijing or Shanghai. All kinds of external rumors are unfounded."</p>
<h3 id="e91">Liu Bandits Flee to Zhucheng; Army, Navy, and Air Force Coordinate to Encircle and Suppress <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Because the Liu bandits lacked ammunition, they planned to flee to the Hongshiya seaport in Zhucheng to replenish ammunition. Yesterday, they fled to the vicinity of Lincun in the east of Zhucheng. Tonight, they were intercepted by the Wu Yuanxing regiment of the 58th Brigade of the 20th Division. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and fled in a panic to the southwest, to Gao Ge Village, and turned southeast. By the afternoon, they had fled to the vicinity of the Chaohe River and were threatening to flee to Rizhao again. The army and navy are now coordinating to block and intercept them. Central aircraft have arrived and dropped bombs today (12th), killing many bandits.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the Liu bandits passed through Louzi and Zhu Supu and fled east, they were attacked from the side by the Li Zhanbiao troops of the 66th Brigade, which were chasing from the south. The bandits suffered heavy casualties. In the evening, they arrived near Lincun and still wanted to continue fleeing east. Tonight, they were intercepted by Wu Yuanxing of the 58th Brigade of the 20th Division at Xiaoshaopo. The battle was fierce in the dark. In this battle, more than 60 bandits were killed, more than 100 were captured, and more than 100 mules and horses and more than 70 guns, and one mortar were captured, with only one shell remaining. It can be seen that the bandits are lacking ammunition, so they are desperately fleeing. Now the remaining bandits are no more than 300, and the mules and horses are no more than 200. Complete annihilation is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>The various bandit suppression forces are now coordinating their advance. Xu Wenyao, the deputy division commander of the 29th Division, led the Li Xiangchen brigade to intercept the bandits from the southwest. The Li Zhanbiao troops of the 66th Brigade are deployed on the north side. Zhan Shutang of the 81st Brigade led the Yun Qichang brigade to take charge of the east side in Jiaoxian. The Tang Bangzhi brigade of the division is on the north side. The Third Fleet dispatched the navy to the ancient town camp at the junction of Jiaoxian and Zhucheng, and today added another ship to that location to prevent the bandits from fleeing to the seaport. Because of the large gathering of the navy, the bandits did not dare to go to Hongshiya, so they fled to Chaohe (which is only three or four li from the border of Rizhao County) and were threatening to flee to Rizhao. Two aircraft dispatched by the central government arrived in Weixian from Xuzhou in the afternoon. Today, Wang Zuwen, a senator of the provincial government, took the plane to Chaohe and dropped six 32-pound bombs, causing heavy casualties among the bandits. Because the Liu bandits fled north, the chairman of the provincial government, Han Fuju, was afraid that the spring would approach the Jiaoji Railway line, so he planned to accompany the chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, Ge Guangting, on a train to inspect the line. Now that the bandits have fled south, he has decided not to leave for the time being. Therefore, Ge Guangting has already returned to Qingdao this morning. (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Political and Military Situation in Kang and Tibet (Continued) <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The military history of the Kang region during the late Qing Dynasty involved garrison troops dispatched by the Sichuan Governor-General. These troops were rotated every three years, with salaries, equipment, and provisions supplied by Sichuan. When Zhao Erfeng came to oversee border affairs, after pacifying Xiangcheng, he proposed comprehensive border political reforms, abolishing the Governor-General's office and replacing it with border defense forces. Initially, three battalions of the Western Army, five battalions of the New Army, and one battalion of the Banner Army were established. Ultimately, it was planned to form a mixed brigade of the New Army, with military expenses totaling over 458,000 taels of silver, allocated from Sichuan's oil and sugar levies. All military supplies were obtained from Sichuan. After the Republican revolution, there were ten battalions of border defense forces and two artillery units. When Yin Changheng led the Western Expedition, he mobilized six standard units and two battalions, along with the entire Ninth and Eleventh Standards. A guard regiment was also formed with a monthly salary of 200,000 taels. In the third year of the Republic, the border garrison commander was appointed, and the remaining army troops were reorganized into the First Border Defense Command, stationed in Ba'an, with one sub-command stationed in Qamdo, and another in Jiangka, totaling eleven border defense battalions, supplemented by one battalion of the Western Expeditionary Army and two artillery units, stationed in various counties west of the Jinsha River, from Derong in the south to Shiqu in the north, and west to Qamdo's Enda. The remaining border troops were reorganized into a mixed brigade, stationed from Xiangcheng in the south to Ganzi in the north, and east to Luding, requiring a monthly border expense of 149,400 taels. In the tenth year of the Republic, Sichuan's divisions changed taels to yuan, continuing with 135,300 yuan, which was disbursed monthly by Sichuan from Military Commissioner Zhang, Liu, to Yin, and military supplies were also requested from Sichuan. The military was well-equipped, the defenses were tight, and the Kang area remained relatively peaceful. In the sixth year of the Republic, Military Commissioner Chen took office, when Sichuan declared a revolution against the Southern government, Chen sided with the Northern Warlords, leading to the cutoff of Sichuan's supplies. The garrisons in Ningyuan and Ya'an were used as substitutes. Later, the Northern government agreed to allocate 80,000 yuan per month from Sichuan's salt revenues for border expenses, which sustained them. However, since the sixth year, Tibetan bandits invaded, losing eleven counties north and south of the border. The border army commanders and their units were disarmed by the Tibetan army. The four battalions under the sub-command stationed in Ningjing were reduced to three after one battalion was disarmed. The three remaining battalions were stationed in Yanjing, Chong'an, and Ba. After the signing of the truce agreement with Tibet in the seventh year, the army brigade was gradually withdrawn to Ya'an, leaving only a battalion of reorganized border troops in Ba'an and Yanjing, and a battalion divided between Ganzi and Zhanhua. The rest were transferred to the Ya'an River area, leaving the border defenses empty and bandits rampant. County officials in Derong and Xiangcheng were repeatedly killed and driven out, and their camp guns were seized. Local thugs became increasingly lawless, and the authority of the government declined, leading to the disintegration of border administration. After Military Commissioner Liu's land reclamation in Kang, the Kang area was still guarded by the original garrison troops, without any reorganization, making it impossible to speak of any military administration. After this army took over Kang, it reorganized the border army into the 14th Brigade and sent the 10th Brigade to Luding to exert control. Later, due to the Sichuan war, the 10th Brigade was transferred internally, leaving only the 14th Brigade as the garrison. Subsequently, the Sichuan-Kang Border Defense Army was established, reorganizing the 10th Brigade into the 1st Brigade, temporarily stationed in Qionglai and Ya'an for training, and reorganizing the 14th Brigade into the 2nd Brigade, with Regiment Commander Ma Sheng promoted to brigade commander. In the 19th year, the 39th Regiment of the 1st Brigade was transferred from Da Jin Temple to Kang for support, stationed in the Daofu-Luhuo area. In the 21st year, during the Tibetan campaign, the 53rd Regiment of the 1st Brigade and the 46th and 48th Regiments of the Ningyuan Defense Army were mobilized to assist in the battle. That winter, the Sichuan war broke out, and the 53rd Regiment was transferred internally. The 11th Brigade was stationed in Kang for garrison duty, merging into one regiment, the 48th Regiment. The total number of troops garrisoning Kang was the 39th Regiment, the 40th Regiment, and the 42nd Regiment, with each battalion supplemented by special forces companies, and a newly formed cavalry regiment, stationed on the east bank of the Jinsha River, confronting the Kang army. The second line of defense in the north, south, and central routes was also continuously reinforced with battalions stationed to provide support. Only a special duty company and two mountain artillery batteries remained in Luding. It was discovered that the Kang army's salaries, provisions, and military supplies all depended on the army headquarters' allocations. However, since the army retreated to Ya'an last year, the border expenses have become unsustainable, and even the strategic rice production area of Mingshan and Hongya Counties was lost, resulting in the Kang army's current situation of extreme financial and supply shortages.</p>
<p>Changes in Tibetan Affairs</p>
<p>Kang and Tibet are neighbors. Governing Kang without first addressing Tibetan affairs will lead to external threats and hinder internal administration. Moreover, Kang and Tibet are of the same ethnicity. If Tibetan affairs are unsettled, Kang affairs will inevitably be affected. Since the Republican revolution, the army mutiny greatly alienated the Tibetan people, leading to daily resistance and separation to this day. The divide between Han and Tibetan people has not been resolved and is, in fact, growing. It was found that in the first year of the Republic, when Lian Zhong and the Dalai Lama fell out, the stationed troops were forced to disarm by the Tibetans. At that time, Yuan Shikai coveted the country's leadership, and the British deliberately stirred up trouble, using Tibet as a bargaining chip, recognizing the Republic in exchange. Therefore, a laissez-faire policy was adopted towards Tibetan affairs. After Lian Yu left Tibet, he merely procrastinated and temporarily appointed Lu Xingqi as the acting chief of the Tibetan Affairs Office. Lu lacked prestige and was originally a low-level merchant. His sudden appointment to a high-ranking position was seen as an insult by the Dalai Lama, who perceived that the Han people had no intention of governing Tibet. Consequently, he severed communications with the central government, and the British took the opportunity to instigate the Tibetans to advocate for autonomy, making the Tibetan situation untenable. Yin Changheng's Western Expedition had an imposing military presence. At that time, Sichuan's financial resources were sufficient to supply his military needs. If Yuan Shikai had not sought personal gain and been timid in listening to their westward advancement, it would not have been difficult to restore the old order. However, he ordered the cessation of advancement and designated Qamdo Enda as the stopping point, preventing the Han army from crossing the Lancang River. The Tibetan people relied on Britain as their protector and became hostile to the Han people. In the sixth year, a minor dispute over grass cutting instigated Tibetan soldiers to take advantage of the situation to invade. Coinciding with the national division between the north and south, Military Commissioner Chen raised the Northern banner and focused on Sichuan, neglecting border defense, allowing the Tibetans to seize eleven counties. The signing of the Rongbaqia truce terms allowed the Tibetans to fulfill their ambition. For more than ten years, China was preoccupied with internal conflicts and did not consider Tibet. The Tibetan people have occupied the land for a long time, considering it their own. The Panchen Lama, due to his pro-Han stance, was forced into exile by the Dalai Lama. China could neither stabilize Tibet through military force nor reconcile the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama's affairs. Instead, it ceremoniously sent the Panchen Lama back to Tibet, singing high praises, further arousing Tibetan suspicion, and worsening Han-Tibetan relations. In the nineteenth year, the Da Jin dispute was not a major issue. The Tibetan side initially intended not to intervene, with some saying that Han officials should handle it themselves. However, ignorant individuals fabricated claims that the Kang army intended to use this opportunity to escort the Panchen Lama back to Tibet. Da Jin then instigated the Dalai Lama to formally assign troops to engage in warfare with the Han people, thereby escalating the situation. Following the Da Jin incident, the central government naively believed the Dalai Lama's claims of peace, prohibiting the Kang army from advancing militarily and demanding that the central government send personnel to mediate and both sides to withdraw their troops and cease fire. At that time, the Tibetan army was west of Da Jin, and our army was east of Baili. The Tibetan army withdrew to its original defense, only a station away. The central government's special envoy for mediation, Tang Keshan, had already arrived in Chongqing. However, Da Jin instigated the Tibetan army to launch a sneak attack while Tang's troops were complying with orders to withdraw and defend, seizing Ganzi and advancing to Zhuwo in Luhuo, and also dispatching troops to seize Zhanhua, which had not been garrisoned by Kang troops. As a result, Tang's delegation proposed that the Tibetan side first comply with the Dalai Lama's telegram ordering the withdrawal of troops from Ganzi and Zhanhua before starting negotiations. The Tibetan side claimed that it was not fulfilling the Dalai Lama's orders, and subsequently, the Dalai Lama formally requested the National Government to subordinate Ganzi and Zhanhua to the Tibetan government. Although the central government refuted this, the Tibetan side ignored it. Tang Kesan's negotiations were ineffective, and he planned to use military force as a backing, requesting the central government to provide the Kang army with funds and equipment to recover the lost territory before resuming negotiations, and also ordering the Qinghai army to assist. The National Government did not provide a concrete response to this proposal for several months. The Dongzhou Difficulty arose, and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission telegraphed Tang to conclude the matter with expediency. Consequently, the Guntuo truce agreement was hastily signed, allowing Tibetan troops to be stationed in Ganzi and Zhanhua. General Liu Wenhui and the Sichuan people strongly opposed this agreement, which was never signed. Tang was then ordered to return to the capital, and the central government telegraphed General Liu Wenhui, granting him full authority over Tibetan affairs. Thus, this army decided to recover the lost territory and wage war against Tibet. The Kang army set April 28th of the 21st year as the date to begin the attack. Tibet launched an attack on the Kang army on the first day. The Kang army divided its command into north and south routes, taking the opportunity to recapture Ganzi and Zhanhua. Tibet greatly reinforced its troops. The Kang army reorganized into five detachments, launching an offensive in the north, south, and central routes, engaging in fierce battles with the Tibetan army between Da Jin and Baili. The Tibetan army could not withstand the attack, and Da Jin was captured. The victory was exploited to advance directly to the east bank of the Jinsha River, successively recovering the four counties of Deyu, Baiyu, Dengke, and Shiqu. A joint attack on Qamdo with the Qinghai army was planned. However, the outbreak of the Sichuan War made it necessary to accept the Tibetan side's request and establish the Gangtuo truce terms.</p>
<p>The Tibetan Army's Strength, Organization, and Deployment</p>
<p>The entire Tibetan army consists of eleven Dabens (a Daben is equivalent to a regiment). During the fighting last year, there were a total of nine Dabens. After the establishment of the Gangtuo truce terms, some were recalled to Central Tibet. After the Qinghai-Tibet agreement was established, troops were dispatched to the Qanglei area, and transferred to Bomi, Shuo Luo Border, Riwuqê, Gongjue, Zhalie, and Jiangka. Militiamen were assigned to the Dabens. According to detailed investigations, the Tibetan side deployed nine Dabens in the north and south routes, with two Dabens in the south route and seven Dabens in the north route. In addition to the 500 troops in the headquarters, each Daben is attached with special forces and militia. Based on the Tibetan army's deployment and recent movements, it is speculated that their talk of peace is a tactic, while their repeated dispatch of personnel to Ya'an (recently, the Tibetan side has repeatedly sent official letters to Ya'an to visit Liu Wenhui, and this reporter encountered two of them at Da Xiangling on the way to Kang) suggests an intent to scout out Sichuan's situation and the Kang army's internal affairs. After these personnel return to Qamdo, it is feared that intense battles will break out.</p>

<p>Preparations for dredging the Songjiang city river have been underway for more than three months. Various plans have been submitted to and approved by the Construction Department, which has also approved the Tai Chang Quarry's construction department to contract the entire project. The official subsidy is 28,000 yuan, and sufficient funds have been raised for the project. Local donations have been collected from two months' worth of rents. The county government has recently announced the dredging procedures, which will begin from the Xinhua Yang Bridge to the east, west to the Qianjing Bridge at the Dongmenkou, and end at the Xizhalu outside the Kuatang Bridge. The branch rivers will be dredged from the Heiqiao to the Pingqiao, and the Hezhang Bridge from the Nanmen to the south of the Pingqiao. The contractor will immediately begin damming the water. The county government has announced that vessels within the affected sections must relocate to facilitate the project.</p>

During the appeal, Songjiang Bank directors and supervisors Qian Xuanqing and Song Lianjiang suddenly accused the credit representatives Bai Guanlan, Zhang Zuo, Liu Wu, and Boyang of fraud in the local procuratorate, presenting lawyer Zhang Yingkui and former provincial assembly members Zhu Hesheng and Sheng Jingsheng as witnesses. Yesterday (the 13th), the investigative court convened at 3:00 PM, with Inspector Meng presiding over the questioning of both the accusers and the accused. Only witness Zhang Yingkui appeared in court. The officer instructed that the hearing would be held after summoning witnesses Zhu and Sheng.</p>

<p>Xing Guangshi, a native of this county, invented the portable weaving machine. After his death, the National Government allocated a pension of 10,000 yuan and instructed the county to raise funds to find a site for his burial. However, Huang Xijie and others claimed that Xing was from Nantong, repeatedly requesting that the burial be stopped, causing delays. Subsequently, Xing's son, Bi Zheng, petitioned the Executive Yuan, arguing that his father was originally from Haimen and should be buried in his native place in accordance with the law. The Executive Yuan has approved this and instructed the county to handle the matter accordingly.</p>

<p>The Xingya Tobacco Company in Sanyang Town, Sixth District, temporarily ceased operations last year due to poor business and inability to sustain itself. Recently, Yang Shiyuan and others invested 5,000 yuan of new capital and were preparing to resume production when they suddenly received an order from the Ministry of Finance, instructing them to comply with the Ministry's regulations requiring tobacco factories to be established in the four major ports (Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Jinan) and to relocate to Shanghai, otherwise they would be shut down and all machinery would be purchased by the government.

However, he did not get up until 10:00 AM the next morning. Colleagues went upstairs to wake him up as it was office hours, but found him cold and barely breathing. They immediately reported to Bank Manager Hao Shebo, who urgently sent him to Jishan Hospital in the North Gate for treatment. Upon examination, there was no suspicious evidence or suicide note on his bedside. Only an empty bottle of Lysol disinfectant was found on the table, indicating that he had taken poison. However, after being sent to the hospital, he died at 1:00 PM due to the severity of the poisoning, despite efforts to save him. The bank urgently telegraphed his family in Zhenjiang to come to Changshu to handle the funeral.</p>

<h3 id="e107">National Economic Commission Decides to Ship American Loaned Flour to Northwest, Road Construction in Northwest Needs Many Workers and Enormous Expenditure, National Flour Has No Market There, So Conflict Can Be Avoided <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that among the cotton and wheat loans signed by Song Ziwen in the United States, 10 million yuan was for wheat loans. Later, the US Financial Relief Bureau, accepting the requests of the American flour manufacturers, negotiated with our government to ship $4 million gold worth of flour, totaling about 300,000 tons or 6 million small bags, out of the 10 million yuan in wheat loans. The National Economic Commission, considering that domestic flour has no market, has decided to ship it to the Northwest for the consumption of road construction workers. Shenshi News Agency reporters have investigated the situation as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e108">To Be Used as Food for Northwest Road Construction Workers <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Due to frequent years of famine, poor wheat harvests, and reliance on foreign aid, the country relies on foreign aid for wheat. As for flour, the domestic production is huge. Shanghai alone can produce more than 100,000 bags per day. Imports of foreign flour will clearly conflict with domestic production. The National Economic Commission's Standing Committee, Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, and Rong Jingjing and other flour manufacturers in Shanghai have repeatedly consulted and decided to ship all the American loaned flour to the Northwest for consumption by road construction workers. The Northwest is currently carrying out large-scale road construction projects such as the Xilan Highway and the Xihan Highway, which require thousands of workers every day and consume a large amount of flour. Shanghai flour mills have traditionally lacked a market in the Northwest, so using American flour can avoid conflict. This is a win-win situation.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Shipping Costs and Vessels Have Been Negotiated <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The first batch of American flour arrived in Shanghai on February 23, totaling 6,000 bags, which were sold out locally. There have been no continued shipments since. Now that the Economic Commission has decided to use it as road construction food for workers in the Northwest, it will no longer be sold in Shanghai in the future to avoid conflicts with the sales of Shanghai factories. It is planned that after June, all the flour will be entrusted to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for transport from the United States to Haizhou Laoyao for unloading, then transferred to the Longhai Railway for westward transportation and delivered to the Xi'an Economic Commission Office for verification and distribution to each road project. According to a certain official of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the American loaned cotton and wheat will depart from Portland and Seattle. The ships needed have been negotiated by Section Chief He Molin in the United States. The shipping cost from the United States to China will be about US$2.5 per ton, saving about US$1 per ton compared to direct transportation by other foreign ships.</p>

<p>Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, accompanied by Professor Rogers, a silver expert dispatched by US President Roosevelt to investigate China, arrived in Shanghai together at 7:30 yesterday morning on the night train. After getting off the train, Kong went straight back to his private residence on West End Road to rest. At 10:00 AM, Song Ziwen, a standing member of the National Economic Commission, visited him to discuss the commission's progress. He left after about half an hour. It is learned that Kong originally planned to hold a tea party yesterday to entertain silver expert Rogers. However, Rogers had already accepted an invitation from the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's Chief Manager Henri Thomsen, so it was decided to reschedule it for today from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM at his private residence on West End Road. In addition to the leaders of the city's banking community, the invitees include US Consul General Keenehan, totaling about 50 people. It is also learned that the city's banking community will present their opinions on the issue of raising silver prices to Rogers at that time for the US government's reference. Furthermore, Zhang Gongquan, Bei Songsun, Li Fuxun, and others hosted a banquet for Rogers in their private capacities at the Bankers Club on Hong Kong Road at 7:30 last night to fulfill their duties as hosts.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Spain National Day - Expatriates Celebrate Today <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Spanish constitution has been in a state of flux for seven years. Since the municipal elections of April 12, 1931, Spanish public opinion has clearly favored the restoration of the republic. After the election results were announced, the monarch abdicated, and the republic was declared two days later. The change of government occurred without bloodshed. Once the parliament convened, a new constitution was promulgated, and Niceto Alcalá-Zamora assumed the presidency. President Alcalá-Zamora was highly respected and enjoyed popular support. Coming from a distinguished family, Alcalá-Zamora made significant contributions to Spanish politics. He studied diligently under his father's tutelage and graduated from the University of Granada at the age of seventeen with a law degree and a doctorate. He initially served as a government judge and held ministerial positions in several cabinets. However, he retired from public life after General Primo de Rivera established a dictatorship, as he firmly believed in liberalism and was loyal to the nation, refusing to be intimidated by power. He later became a founding member of the revolution. On April 13, 1930, he issued a rallying cry in Valencia, becoming a pioneer of the republic and a key figure in the shift of public sentiment. In this public statement, Alcalá-Zamora declared that a republican government was the only way to stabilize the Spanish political situation. On December 11, 1931, amidst enthusiastic cheers, Alcalá-Zamora swore to uphold the constitution and assumed the presidency, diligently serving the country to this day. The foundation of the Spanish Republic has been stabilized, and his contributions have been significant. The Spanish people have been able to promote and enhance it, making it a glorious event in history, worthy of being remembered. The Spanish people have therefore designated April 14th as their National Day. The Spanish Consul-General in Shanghai has scheduled a commemorative event from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM at the Cathay Hotel, inviting government officials, local authorities, and foreign diplomats to participate in the grand occasion. Spanish expatriates will hold a celebration from 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM at the Spanish Consulate-General at No. 1205 Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<h3 id="e112">French International Trade Association Petitions for Promotion of Sino-French Trade - Chinese International Trade Association Submits its Views <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Chinese International Trade Association previously received a letter from the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, which included a petition form from the Paris International Trade Association for promoting Sino-French trade, as well as a request for the appointment of two Chinese representatives to participate in various events. The association was asked to submit its views. Yesterday, the association sent a reply to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, stating that it had received a letter forwarded by the International Trade Bureau, based on an order from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which in turn was based on a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to a report from the Consulate General in Paris, the Vice-President of the Paris International Trade Association sent a petition form to promote Sino-French trade and requested the appointment of two Chinese representatives to participate in various events, with the intention of appointing Lu Qinzhai and Ma Shoubai as representatives. The matter was submitted to the Ministry for review and instructed the Bureau to inform the International Trade Association and relevant organizations, and to inquire whether there were any volunteers to send representatives to participate in the association, and whether they agreed with the Consulate General's proposal to appoint Lu Qinzhai and Ma Shoubai, as well as to deliberate on the committee's petition and provide a detailed response. The letter was forwarded to the association, which in turn forwarded it to this association for review. The association notes that the Paris International Trade Association held a meeting last year, and the International Trade Bureau's letter was approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to send representatives. However, due to the proximity of the meeting, the association was unable to send personnel and replied to the International Trade Bureau, submitting a report on file. This time, the association sent a petition form and reiterated its request for the appointment of representatives. The Consul General in Paris proposed to appoint Lu and Ma as representatives, and the Ministry ordered a review. This association has not received a letter from the International Trade Bureau informing it of this matter. Now, with the letter from your association forwarding the previous cause, this association expresses its strong agreement with the Paris Consul General's proposal to appoint Lu and Ma as representatives to participate in the association. As for the various requests mentioned in the petition form of the Paris International Trade Association, this association has carefully considered them and presents its opinions as follows: Regarding the association's request to reduce the tax rates on French specialty industrial products such as woolen yarn, woolen fabrics, cloth, printed fabrics, silk fabrics, rayon fabrics, perfumes, cosmetics, lace, champagne, high-quality brandy, and cheese, etc., it should be noted that tariffs are divided into fiscal tariffs and protective tariffs. Fiscal tariffs are aimed at enriching the national treasury, and their tax rates are naturally limited. Protective tariffs, on the other hand, are aimed at protecting domestic industries and resisting foreign competition, and their tax rates are naturally different from fiscal tariffs. However, the interests of consumers should also be taken into account, and the rates should not exceed what is necessary. Furthermore, excessively high tax rates will inevitably lead to smuggling, and the resulting increase in administrative expenses may outweigh the benefits. Since China's achievement of tariff autonomy, the tax rates on woolen yarn, woolen fabrics, cloth, silk fabrics, rayon fabrics, perfumes, cosmetics, and cheese have indeed increased significantly compared to the old tax rates. However, these goods either have luxury characteristics or, although not luxury goods, are not French products. Due to the most-favored-nation clause in China's tariff treaties, if the tax rates on these French imports are reduced, then similar products from other countries will also benefit equally, which may not be feasible at present. This association believes that maintaining the current tax rates for a considerable period is still a way to balance the interests of both parties. Regarding the association's request to separately stipulate the tax rates for raw silk and rayon, and to avoid levying excessively high tax rates on rayon as it is a daily necessity, it should be noted that rayon is a raw material for textiles, and China does not currently produce it. Therefore, its tax rate cannot be compared with that of natural silk and should be levied at a lower rate. In the past, rayon was subject to an ad valorem tax of 5%, which was increased to 10% in 1929. Calculated at the prices at the time, this amounted to slightly more than 10 taels per dan. In the 1931 tariff, it was changed to a specific duty of 58 gold units per dan. Since August 1932, it has been further increased to 73 gold units per dan, which is equivalent to more than 80% ad valorem. The tax rate cannot be said to be low. India's import tax on rayon is only 25% ad valorem, and Japan's is 101 yuan per 100 catties, both of which are lower than China's. Since the successive tax increases, the import volume of rayon has been declining year by year, and smuggling is rampant, which is detrimental to legitimate merchants. This association believes that reducing the import tax on rayon is feasible from the perspective of developing domestic industries and expanding the national treasury. This request seems to be acceptable. Regarding the association's request to protect trademark rights and the original names of various commodities, such as champagne, brandy, and cheese, etc., Article 6 of China's Trademark Law stipulates that "Foreign nationals who wish to exclusively use their trademarks in accordance with treaties on mutual protection of trademarks shall apply for registration in accordance with this law." Therefore, French imported goods that have been registered can be protected by law, which is not a problem. Regarding the association's request to reduce the taxes on various important Chinese exports, it should be noted that taxing export goods will increase the cost of domestic production and reduce their competitiveness in the international market. In recent times, countries, except for a few special monopoly products, not only exempt taxes on general goods but also provide subsidies. China's international trade has long been in a state of deficit. In recent years, due to the loss of some trade in the three northeastern provinces and the impact of the global economic recession and the increase in tariff barriers in various countries, the deficit has become even more severe. In 1932, it reached more than 500 million yuan, and in 1933, it reached more than 700 million yuan. The future is dangerous and indescribable. Export taxes should be abolished as soon as possible as a remedial measure. Furthermore, international trade aims at mutual exchange, and tariffs should be based on the principle of reciprocity to benefit both parties. If France asks China to reduce import taxes, the association's goods will also be given corresponding preferential treatment. According to the Sino-French tariff treaty, the Chinese goods that enjoy the lowest tax rates include pure silk fabrics, pure silk scarves, pure silk crepe, pure silk nets, pure silk lace, pepper, chili, cinnamon, nutmeg with shell, cloves, and tea. However, major export goods to France, such as eggs and egg products, peanuts, raw silk, silkworm cocoons, straw hat frames, pig intestines, pig bristles, tung oil, cowhide, and antimony, have not been explicitly included in the lowest tax rates, which hinders the promotion of Sino-French trade. This association hopes that the association understands this situation and also suggests to the French government that the above goods be allowed to enjoy the lowest tax rates, which will greatly benefit the progress of trade between the two countries. This association's opinion is as such, and a corresponding letter is sent for your consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Joint Meeting of the British Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Branch of the China Association Held the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai and the Shanghai branch of the China Association held a joint annual meeting yesterday (the 12th) at the Shanghai Club. Speakers included Marshall, the President of the Chamber of Commerce, Brenan, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, and Peel, the Commercial Counselor of the British Legation. Marshall first delivered a speech, generally outlining the following points:</p>
<p>(I) China's Trade. At last year's annual meeting, it was mentioned that 1932 was one of the worst years in the history of Chinese trade, and 1933 saw further decline. This year, apart from the Fujian Incident, the Jiangxi Rebellion, and minor disturbances in the north, China did not experience any major internal wars or unrest that would affect commerce in a vast area. Although Chinese trade was hampered by restrictive taxes and unstable conditions, the main reason for the decline in trade was the situation outside China.</p>
<p>(II) Internal Disorder. Although the Fujian Incident never threatened the central government, the government spent a great deal of military expenditure as a result. Otherwise, this money could have been used for construction projects. Military operations to suppress the communists in Jiangxi Province and elsewhere still require a large army, but the government is fully aware of the economic nature of the problem. Therefore, it is now working hard to revive the countryside. The government's work is not easy and will take time to succeed. However, unless the economic conditions of those working in rural areas are improved, appropriate rural systems are established, and all kinds of exorbitant taxes are abolished, communism cannot be eradicated, and troublemakers will still have fertile ground to sow destructive ideas. The rural development and New Life Movement are spreading rapidly throughout the country. If the enthusiasm of the general public can remain unchanged for a long time, it will have a significant impact on the lives of the people and will directly benefit the economic situation. If China can rebuild its foundations according to the principles set by those who promote the New Life Movement and succeed, then there is no need to worry about the upper structure.</p>
<p>(III) Purchasing Power. The decline in trade in 1933 was largely due to the result of the world's economic misfortunes, which reduced purchasing power, and the adoption of artificial methods by many countries to seek national prosperity. Here, the total value of China's import and export trade in 1933 is compared with that of 1932 (excluding the three northeastern provinces). In 1933, it decreased by 136 million yuan, or about 15%. Tax revenue, however, increased by 46 million yuan due to increased tariffs. The new tariff regulations were implemented in 1933, many of which were too high, causing great damage to import trade. However, they can be revised in a scientific way so that trade and tax revenue are not harmed. The current tariffs are both hindering legitimate trade and making it profitable to smuggle certain kinds of goods. Therefore, both legitimate traders and tax revenue are suffering losses.</p>
<p>(IV) Factories. Although the increase in factories equipped with electric machinery to manufacture various goods for domestic consumption was not significant this year, it is still progressing step by step. Although the output of many factories is currently relatively small, its movement is worthy of attention. Although the yarn factories' business is languishing, new factories are still being opened, but more in the outer provinces. In the future, with the convenience of transportation, this kind of development will inevitably spread more widely. The bleaching and dyeing industry is also developing, and several of the newest factories are currently under construction. In addition, the woolen fabric industry, which China has never paid attention to, is now seeing an increase in demand due to the high taxes on wool materials. Therefore, some people have ordered woolen fabric weaving machines, and in the future, there will inevitably be many people who will engage in this industry. The electric power equipment for lighting and industrial use is now receiving great attention. When the situation is stable in the future, or when natural disasters are eliminated, the national demand will inevitably increase greatly.</p>
<p>(V) Railways, Highways, and Telegraphs. The construction of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, using funds from the British return of the Boxer Indemnity, has begun and is planned to be 220 miles long. It can be completed in about three years. There is also an important railway currently under construction by the Zhejiang Provincial authorities, namely the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. It has now been extended to Yushan and will eventually connect with the Guangdong-Hankou Railway via Pingxiang. The construction of highways in various provinces is also actively underway. The Shanghai-Nanjing Highway will be completed this summer. Once the main roads are completed, the construction of branch roads can make the development of the Jiangsu Province industry easier and more progressive. Based on the current rate of progress, the major cities will soon be connected by a highway network, which will greatly benefit the national political, economic, and social life. In addition, it will facilitate transportation and the transport of goods. The communication of telephone and telegraph has also made progress through the expansion of wireless and landlines. At the beginning of this year, the Zhenru Marconi Radio Station was able to directly communicate with London via wireless telegraph. Soon, it will be possible to establish commercial telephone communication with London. The progress of domestic transportation will greatly help commerce.</p>
<p>(VI) Siberian Mail. Commerce relies heavily on prompt information. Now, due to political difficulties, mail to and from Central Europe cannot use the fastest route via Dalian, which causes delays in delivery, greatly harming and inconveniencing merchants. It is hoped that this kind of commercial obstacle can be eliminated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(VII) Changing Tael to Yuan. The government and business community now use silver dollars in general. If the composition and weight of the silver dollars remain unchanged for a long time, then this move will be very beneficial to commerce. The silver coins minted by the Central Mint have been chemically tested from time to time, and no differences have been found in their weight and composition.</p>
<p>(VIII) Silver Price Fluctuations. The price of silver is artificially raised. If other goods do not rise at the same time, then it cannot have any lasting beneficial effect, even in silver-producing countries. China is a silver-using country. Any artificial method to raise the price of silver will hinder its export trade and increase the already large trade surplus, which will have harmful results on trade and commerce. Therefore, it is hoped that the current recommendations strongly advocated by foreign countries can be cancelled.</p>
<p>(IX) New Weights and Measures System. After the customs adopted the new system, the difficulties it encountered were not as severe as initially expected. Although the conversion is very troublesome and time-consuming, it is inevitable at the beginning of the reform.</p>
<p>(X) Sino-Foreign Lawsuits. When merchants encounter commercial disputes, they are still unwilling to sue in local courts and prefer to mediate outside the courts. However, it is heard that as a result of negotiations, matters concerning appeals and delays have been revised. As a result, there has been progress in civil law administration, and unwarranted appeals are gradually decreasing. However, there are still many areas that need to be reformed.</p>
<p>(XI) Commodity Labeling. The implementation period of the regulations on labeling commodities with the country of origin has been extended from August 1, 1933 to July 1, 1934. However, the recently formulated regulations still have many technical obstacles and need to be revised in various ways before implementation.</p>
<p>(XII) Foreign Investment in China. Although the Chinese authorities often draw foreigners' attention to investment opportunities in China, it seems difficult to attract foreign capital if China continues to discriminate against the products of factories that are entirely or partially managed by foreigners. In the past, China only encouraged industrialists and never cared about the needs and well-being of farmers and rural workers. Now, it is known that it is engaged in rural development. It is hoped that in the future, equal importance will be attached to both agriculture and industry, without any discrimination. If China's industry continues to ignore agriculture, it will never succeed. Although China's trade and commerce declined this year, it has made genuine progress in various aspects, especially the material development of various provinces and cities. The Chinese authorities are now working hard to improve the lives of their citizens, which will have a beneficial reaction and improve the trade situation. After Marshall finished speaking, he reported on the work done by the Chamber of Commerce in the past year, followed by the British Consul-General.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Brenan's Speech <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Briefly stated that the British government's policy towards China, in a nutshell, is to assist China's development and maintain an effective and stable government in accordance with the treaty. The British government has this purpose in mind and has stated that it is willing to follow the wishes and aspirations of the Chinese as far as possible, while paying due attention to the existing interests of the British. Recently, British Ambassador Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen told us at a banquet that the British government's policy has not changed. What we are most concerned about is trade between China and Britain. Our main objective is the Chinese market. In the future, when the provinces return to a state of tranquility, this market will inevitably expand indefinitely, and the only force that can give us this situation is a strong Chinese government. Therefore, we sympathize with the Chinese people's desire for good governance and to be governed by themselves. As for the internal unrest in China, we should not be too impatient or exaggerate it. It should be known that China's territory is as wide as Europe, and Europe also has a lot of unrest today. Then Marshall thanked Brenan and invited.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Peel to Speak <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Peel stood up and delivered a speech, briefly stating that the chairman had just mentioned the situation of China's import and export trade and asked you to pay attention to its decline. It was found that it fell by no less than 33% in 1931 and 1932, and fell by another 15% in 1933. In the first two months of this year, it continued to fall by 20%. One of the major weaknesses of Chinese trade is that the number of exports is less than half of the number of imports. I don't know what method will be used to make up for it. Although overseas Chinese remit huge sums of money every year, I am afraid that it is less than 25 million pounds per year. If so, there are still 25 million pounds that cannot be offset. China's import trade is now greatly affected by domestic products. This can be proved by the cotton textile industry. The import of raw cotton was 250,000 dan in 1912 and has increased to 3.75 million dan in 1932, all for the use of domestic factories to make yarn and weave cloth. In these twenty years, cotton yarn has fallen from 2.5 million dan to 96,000 dan, and the rest has been replaced by domestic products. Cotton fabrics have been reduced from 2 million dan to 200,000 dan, a reduction of 60% in the past four or five years. This is indeed extremely unwelcome by British merchants, but the number of British cotton goods imported into China today is still increasing compared to the past ten years. The United Kingdom is now the second largest supplier of cotton goods needed by China. If we talk about the entire British Empire, it is the largest supplier, accounting for 30% of the total imports. The number of China's exports to the United Kingdom has also increased compared to the past ten years. The United Kingdom is the largest buyer of Chinese eggs, and the number of eggs imported into the United Kingdom is the first on the list. It has defeated Denmark. The eggs exported to the United Kingdom last year were worth more than 2.5 million pounds. The increase in British trade with China is not due to China's boycott of Japanese goods, but to the superior competitiveness of the United Kingdom. Peel continued to say that China has a vast territory, a large population, and the people are hardworking and able to endure hardship. In the future, when the local area is stable and the industry is guided by capable people, it will definitely be able to quickly occupy a position among the major countries in the world. Then he reported on the accounts, which were approved by the audience, and new directors were elected, and all the old directors were re-elected. Then the meeting of the China Association was opened. The only speaker was President Hu Dehai, who generally discussed various matters and mentioned the political situation in China.</p>

<p>Mystery of the Missing Central Aviation Aircraft</p>
<h3 id="e122">Ten Aircraft Sent Out Yesterday Morning to Investigate and Discover the Aircraft's Flight Direction - Jin Tangshan Island Residents Reported Seeing It Fly West at 9:00 AM That Day - According to General Speculation, the Aircraft Has Not Crashed and There Must Be Other Reasons - A Large Number of Aircraft Will Continue to Be Dispatched Today to Investigate the Whereabouts Based on Clues - The Stranded Sikorsky Aircraft Was Damaged by Waves and Will Be Towed Back by a Ship <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, the Central Aviation Corporation's No. 16 Sikorsky aircraft has been missing for four days. Yesterday, starting from the morning, all parties continued to dispatch ten aircraft to search. By 5:30 PM, the aircraft had returned one after another, but there were still no results. Only a very noteworthy clue was discovered. According to one of the pilots dispatched, Norris, he reported to the company at 3:30 PM after returning that he had landed on Jin Tangshan Island, which is about twenty miles away from Yuxingnao. According to the villagers there, the aircraft had flown over the island on Tuesday morning, but it was flying westward. According to the company's report, aircraft will be dispatched directly to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi border and the Poyang Lake area this morning to investigate. At the same time, suspicious points have also been discovered regarding a passenger on the aircraft. The Shenshi News Agency reporter will record the details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e123">Ten Aircraft Dispatched for Search Along the Route <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of ten aircraft were dispatched to search for the missing aircraft, including two China Aviation Corporation Lockheed aircraft, with Allison and Norris each accompanied by a radio operator, departing at 6:10 AM. Two Eurasia Junkers aircraft departed at 10:30 AM. Four aircraft dispatched by the Hangzhou Aviation School departed from Hangzhou at 11:00 AM. A Hawker Condor aircraft departed at 8:00 AM. White of the Far East Company, accompanied by his wife, departed in their aircraft at 8:00 AM, searching separately along the coast and land. After 2:00 PM, the aircraft returned one after another. Despite the day-long efforts of all the aircraft, the whereabouts of Aircraft No. 16 remained undiscovered.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Pilot Discovers Whereabouts of Missing Aircraft <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>According to pilot Norris, who departed at the same time yesterday, after returning at 3:30 PM, he reported to the company that the aircraft had flown to Kington Island (twenty miles away from Voloano Island) and landed there. (According to that location, it was the place from where the aircraft telegraphed its return at 8:30 AM on the day of the disappearance). Searching everywhere, the islanders reported that the missing aircraft had flown over the island at 9:00 AM on Tuesday morning, heading west. All the people on the island witnessed this. According to the company and experts, based on the report, they speculated that the aircraft had not crashed and that there must be other reasons. The aircraft had telegraphed from Voloano Island at 8:30 AM that it was returning, yet at 9:00 AM it was still flying west of the island. This clearly indicated that it had not returned and had not crashed, but that there was some other unfathomable reason.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Company Announces Suspicious Passenger <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Although some oil slicks were found in the sea near Zhoushan Island as a result of the day-long search yesterday, there was still no more reliable discovery, making it difficult to determine that the aircraft had crashed into the water. The aircraft carried two rubber inflatable rafts on its wings, and if the aircraft had sunk, the rafts would definitely have floated to the surface. According to the company's announcement yesterday, the missing aircraft's passenger has been found to be highly suspicious. The passenger was named (Yuemura) and his destination was Fuzhou. When he purchased the ticket from the company, he spoke Japanese, so the company staff all regarded him as Japanese. However, according to the Japanese Consulate, there is no such Japanese person in Shanghai. Moreover, an hour after the passenger boarded the aircraft, two Chinese people suddenly came to the company, requesting the company to send a wireless message to the passenger on the aircraft. The message was in English, and the gist of it was to tell the passenger that after arriving in Fuzhou, he must quickly take a ship to another place, but the destination was not specified. The company refused according to regulations, and the two men left in disappointment. After the news of the aircraft's disappearance spread, neither the passenger's relatives nor the two Chinese people came to the company to inquire about it. According to various speculations, the passenger is indeed highly suspicious. The company has telegraphed the government and the Ministry of Communications with all the suspicious clues discovered yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Aircraft Dispatched Today to Search Westward <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>After receiving Norris's report yesterday, the company firmly believes that most of the aircraft has not crashed, but has strayed elsewhere due to some reason. Therefore, they will dispatch more aircraft today to search for it on various islands, and dispatch other aircraft to search westward, hoping to find traces in the Poyang Lake area on the border of Jiangxi and Zhejiang. It is also possible that the aircraft carried enough gasoline for more than five hours of long-distance flight when it departed, and may have flown to a more distant place. As for Nie Kai and others, they will still sail along the coast to explore today. The company originally planned to send a large team to search all the islands, but because the weather was clear yesterday and the aircraft had searched in great detail, there was no need to repeat the futile effort, so the decision was made to temporarily suspend the departure.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Reconnaissance Aircraft Aground, Damaged by Waves <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>As for the No. 19 Sikorsky aircraft, which was dispatched the day before yesterday to search for the missing aircraft, it ran aground and went missing. It was found anchored off Voloano Island and was subsequently hit by violent waves, causing the anchor chain to break suddenly, and drifting with the wind until it ran aground near Zhenhai. According to a telegram yesterday morning, the aircraft's wings and hull 2 were damaged due to the violent impact of the wind and waves, and it could not fly. The company decided to send a barge to tow it back for repairs within a few days. The pilots in the aircraft, Groschke and Sayler, have returned to Shanghai, while Huada and Mr. Lin are temporarily staying with the aircraft to guard it.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Shanghai-Chongqing Line Temporarily Reduced and Suspended <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hankou flights were temporarily suspended because the Lockheed aircraft had to be dispatched to search for the missing aircraft and there were no other aircraft available. The Hankou-Chongqing line, which was originally scheduled for three flights per week, has now been reduced to two flights per week. The Shanghai-Beijing flights today will continue as usual. The Shanghai-Guangzhou line has been temporarily suspended pending the outcome of the search for the missing aircraft, after which it will be restored to its original state.</p>

<p>The Jiangnan Railway Company held its first annual shareholders' meeting at the World Society Auditorium the day before yesterday. 147 shareholders and representatives attended. Supervisors were re-elected, and the increase of capital to $3 million and the completion of the entire Beijing-Fujian railway line were approved. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Shareholders' Meeting: The first annual shareholders' meeting of the Jiangnan Railway Company was held at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. Shareholders and representatives, including Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng, Ye Chucang, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Yang Zhixiong, and others, totaling 147 people, attended. Chairman of the Board, Song Ziwen, was unable to attend due to other commitments and was represented by Zhang Xiaolin as acting chairman. (1) Reports: (A) Report on resolutions of previous board meetings; (B) Report on the 1932 account and the Lixin Accountant's certificate; (C) Engineering Report; (D) Director Li Shizeng insisted on resigning as chairman. The 21st Board of Directors meeting resolved to approve this resignation and publicly elected Director Song Ziwen to succeed as chairman of the board. (2) Matters for discussion: (A) Resolved to complete the entire Beijing-Fujian railway line in stages, temporarily postpone the construction of the Sunjiabu to Zhapu section, and complete the Beijing-Wuhu section by the end of this year in order to connect with the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway; (B) Resolved to increase capital to $3 million; (C) Resolved to amend Article 27 of the Articles of Association to increase the number of directors by four and supervisors by two in order to increase capital. Additional directors will be elected at a special shareholders' meeting; (D) Re-election of supervisors: Chu Minyi, Qin Daishi, Yang Zhixiong, Xu Guannan, Zhou Wenrui, Wei Bocong, Fang Yaoting, and seven others were elected.</p>
<p>Completion in Stages: When the company was founded, the original plan was to build the Wuhu-Zhapu Railway, from Wuhu in Anhui, through Xuancheng, Guangde, Wuxing, and Jiaxing, to Zhapu in Zhejiang. Since construction began last year, progress has been very rapid. The Wuhu to Zhusigang section has already been temporarily opened for ticketing. Subsequently, the company planned to extend the line north to Nanjing and south to Zhao'an on the Fujian border, with the approval of the Ministry of Railways. After detailed planning, this was submitted to the shareholders' meeting and it was resolved to complete it in four stages. It is expected that the Beijing-Wuhu section will be completed by the end of this year and connected to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. The Wuhu to Sunjiabu section will be completed in mid-May. By the end of 1935, it will be extended to Shexian (Huizhou). By the end of 1936, it will be connected to the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. By the end of 1937, it will be built across the Xianxia Ridge from Yushan to Zhao'an on the Fujian border, and the entire line will be completed. The construction cost will increase to $3 million by the end of this year. More than $2.7 million of the capital has already been raised, and it will continue to be increased gradually in order to complete each stage of the project.</p>
<p>Active Construction: The section from Wuhu to Zhusigang has been temporarily opened to traffic, with only third-class tickets being sold. However, due to incomplete facilities, first-class passengers are charged a reduced fourth-class fare. According to the report from that location, the operating income is about $100 per day. The engineering vehicle has already been opened to Wanzi. According to the original plan, it can be built to Xuancheng this month. However, due to the delay in the bridge construction there, it must be completed in late May. At that time, a traffic opening ceremony will be held. At the same time, the Beijing-Wuhu section project is limited to completion before the end of this year. Therefore, the survey of the route started on the 25th of last month. The engineering department has limited the completion to the 5th of next month. Then the earthwork project can be tendered and started two months later. There is only one bridge in Dangtu in this section, which is also being planned and is planned to be built at the same time to avoid delaying the project.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Case of Russian Vagrants Impersonating French Vice-Consul Continues to be Tried Yesterday. The Defendants' Statements are Cunning and Stubbornly Refuse to Tell the Truth. Because the Two Key Witnesses, Xu and Fan, Were Not Present, the Date was Changed. <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Russian vagrants Raiviski, et al., previously impersonated French Vice-Consul and French Police General Inspector and Detective Chief, etc., falsely claiming to allow the establishment of gambling dens, defrauding Chinese Xu Haidu and Fan Gongru of huge sums. The French Police, together with the Chinese and Western detectives of the Joint Police Station, arrested the defendants at the Dante Moses Restaurant on March 28 of this year and sent them to the Second Special Court for trial. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date for the continuation of the trial. The interrogation is recorded below.</p>
<p>Case Overview: Three Russian vagrants, Raiviski, Lawmanov, and Bobov, impersonated the French Vice-Consul, the French Police General Inspector, and the French Police Detective Chief, etc., colluding with accomplices Sheshenaufa and Laguri Avaladimir, etc., to defraud Xu Haidu, a Chinese resident in the Sun Temple area of ​​Zhabei (formerly worked in the sample room of the British Public Works Department and opened the Danggui First Stage Theater), on the grounds that they were allowed to establish a club gambling den within the French Concession, defrauding him of 30,000 yuan in activity expenses. Xu first paid 2,000 yuan. Fan Gongxu, a native of Zhenjiang, who lived at No. 5 Lishui Lane, Danshui Road, intended to open a kitchen in the gambling den and also paid Raiviski et al. 1,000 yuan. Xu et al. believed that the matter had been successful and rented a house at No. 3 Garden Lane, 634 Avenue Joffre, and started preparing for the layout.</p>
<p>Later, an accomplice secretly arranged for Xu and Fan to host a banquet for Raiviski et al. at the Dante Moses Restaurant on Sichuan Road at 7:00 PM on the 28th of last month, and invited Pan Jielu to invite Qian Chenglong, the chief translator of the French Police, to act as an interpreter. Qian detected the flaw and reported it to Fan Langdeng, the deputy inspector of the French Police, who led Western detectives Yang Gaoski and Ivanoff to report to the Joint Police Station and ordered Chinese and Western detectives to assist. Lai, Lao, Bao, and Si were arrested one after another and taken back to the police station and transferred to the Second Special District Local Court for interrogation and investigation. During the postponement, the accomplice Laguri Avramir was arrested, and a full set of roulette gambling equipment was found in his home and sent to the court for joint investigation. The details have been reported in the previous newspaper. Waiting outside the Dante Moses Restaurant, I went to the Dante Moses Restaurant, where Xu Haidu introduced me to Raiviski. Xu said that he was the French Vice-Consul Buerui. Xu also pointed to Lawmanov as the French General Inspector and Bobov as the Detective Chief. When taking a seat, Lai said that the Avenue Joffre No. 634 had been issued a shooting permit for six months and that any gambling game could be established in the future.</p>
<p>Demanding 30,000 yuan, it was necessary to lobby the French Consul General and the police station for 30,000 yuan, with 15,000 yuan for lobbying fees and 15,000 yuan for start-up fees, etc. I resigned without waiting for the end of the banquet and reported to the deputy inspector who was waiting outside the door, who immediately arrested the defendants, etc., said the official, ordering the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 4th defendants to be taken down. According to the first defendant, Raiviski, he knew Xu Haidu and met him in January of this year at Lawmanov's house, introduced by Lao. Xu said that he had worked in the Public Works Department for 30 years. At that time, Lao said to Xu in French, "I am Bai Er Lai," but he did not say that he was a consul.</p>
<p>(Cigarette nickname) Bai Er Lai is my nickname, that is, the name of a cigarette. I met at Dante Moses on March 28. Qian Chenglong did not say to Qian that I was Vice-Consul Buerui. I met with Xu twice. The officer ordered the third defendant, Lawmanov, to be brought to court. According to the confession, he knew Xu Haidu for about four or five months, about December of last year or January of this year, but he didn't remember clearly. He introduced Xu to Raiviski, about on a road beside a car between a hotel on Avenue de France and the French Consulate.</p>
<p>(Adjourned for further hearing) At that time, I said to Xu, Raiviski Bai Er Lai, is Lai's nickname, which is a cigarette term. I didn't say that Lai was the French consul. Xu and Lai met twice. The first time was by the roadside, and the second time was the day of the arrest, etc. By this time, it was past noon. The court said that the witnesses were not complete and could not be tried, and announced that the hearing would be adjourned for another 20 days. The defendants were still sent back to prison separately. The defendants' lawyer then claimed that the police had finished investigating the defendants and requested that they be allowed to post bail pending trial. The officer said that the case was serious and that the defendants had not been fully interrogated. The request for bail was rejected. The defendants were then taken down by the bailiffs and sent back to the police station.</p>

<p>The Rende Hall of the Shanghai Guangzhao Scaffolding Trade is organized by Cantonese carpenters. Its nature is similar to a trade union. It was founded during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty and has a history of more than 80 years. It has always aimed to connect with the homeland and assist fellow tradesmen. Each year, several directors are elected to handle the hall's affairs. The hall's funds have always been collected from donations from fellow tradesmen and are quite sufficient. The funds accumulated over the years have been used to purchase real estate. Currently, there are two properties: one is the hall's address, and the other is the entire real estate of the North and South Rende Lane on Dongxi Huade Road. Due to the years of purchase, the value of the property has increased to</p>
<p>(more than 600,000) yuan. The regular expenses of the Rende Hall and the free school run by the hall are maintained by the income from the property. In 1931, the hall revised its regulations and formally reorganized according to the trade union method, abolishing the director system and adopting the committee system. However, when it was first registered with the Social Affairs Bureau, ambitious elements among the fellow tradesmen, who had long coveted the hall's huge assets, took the opportunity to collude with each other and forcibly take control. Those who kept themselves clean then retired and were unwilling to compete. Since then, each election has been held by these people to re-elect themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Taking Advantage for Personal Gain <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Last year, on the pretext of relieving unemployed fellow tradesmen, a few people advocated the unauthorized sale of all the real estate in the North and South Rende Lane, and the proceeds were freely disposed of. At that time, the Cantonese expatriates in Shanghai were all dissatisfied, and finally their undisclosed control aroused public anger. Then there was a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to withhold and investigate the funds deposited in the Hongkou Commercial Bank. As a result of the thorough investigation by the Social Affairs Bureau, it was determined that the hall's committee members Li Jiafu, Chen Yinbao, Qiu Shen, Li Jianfang, Zhu Jingcai, Huang Huibao, etc.</p>
<p>(unauthorized sale of public property) took the opportunity to commit malpractice, all of which were evidenced. Therefore, the bureau immediately ordered the hall to reorganize and, because fellow tradesman Lu Bingjie was quite trusted by the public, he was appointed to be responsible for convening a re-election meeting. Before the reorganization, Lu Bingjie was allowed to take over all the hall's affairs on a temporary basis, and the former illegal committee members were given a deadline to hand over the hall's affairs. Unexpectedly, Li Jiafu et al. hid the seals, account books, deeds, etc. and refused to hand them over. However, unemployed fellow tradesmen waiting to receive relief funds could not receive the funds and their hardships deepened. Lu Bingjie, in his capacity as a responsible person, repeatedly petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau on his behalf. With the approval of the bureau,</p>
<p>(Relief funds were issued first) A special notice was issued to Tong Bank to release the funds. Unexpectedly, Li et al. relied on the seized seals and sent a letter to the bank to stop payment. Because both parties had a dispute, the bank handed over all its deposits to the First Special District Local Court for safekeeping, pending legal resolution. On the 9th of last month, Lu convened a reorganization meeting according to the law, but Li et al. suddenly went to interfere and used lawyers as their amulet, tore up the meeting agenda and seized the meeting sign-in book, wantonly making trouble. After the suppression by Peng Zhenqiu and Rao Qiangsheng, representatives sent by the Social Affairs Bureau to monitor the meeting, Li et al. dispersed. The meeting was then opened. A total of</p>
<p>(270 fellow tradesmen attended) Under the guidance of the monitors, 11 organizing committee members were first elected to carry out the reorganization in advance. The meeting also passed resolutions to remove the illegal committee members Li Jiafu et al. from their posts and invalidate the old seals, and reported the resolutions to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval to put them into use. Soon after, they sent a letter to the First Special District Local Court, requesting that the funds deposited in the Tong Bank be returned to the hall for collection so as to relieve the unemployed fellow tradesmen. The special court then summoned them yesterday, and Judge Tao Dejun instructed the hall's representatives to transfer the deposit to Chen Enxian et al., the opposing party, who had filed a lawsuit. Before</p>
<p>(the judgment is confirmed), it is not convenient to issue the funds. If the procedures are legal, the reasons are sufficient, and there is sufficient evidence, they can be submitted at the future trial and await a fair hearing, etc. After the representatives of the teachers, they submitted a petition to the bureau, stating the circumstances of the court summons, and said that this matter originally belonged to a social group dispute, which should be handled by your bureau. Even if the opposing party does not agree, they can appeal to your court. However, they dare to play tricks and disrupt the government, causing litigation. Moreover, the unemployed fellow tradesmen are suffering from hunger and cold,</p>
<p>(leading and waiting for assistance) Fang Ji relief is on the way, and life can be turned from danger to safety. Unexpectedly, the funds were withheld and plunged into a slow litigation process, then I don't know how many years it will be delayed for this. The factual report is submitted secretly to the court, requesting the court to hand over the hall's funds to the responsible persons of the hall's organizing committee for distribution. It is also heard that the First Special Court will also summon the two parties in Chen Enbao et al.'s case against Lu Bingjie et al. within days to continue the investigation so as to resolve it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Jinjiachao, Xijiu Village, Yangjing Town, Pudong, is a village. There is a Sanxiu Experimental Primary School. The students are all farmers' children and are extremely naughty. At about 9:00 AM yesterday (the 13th), the school opened and the students gathered. However, there was still half an hour before class. Therefore, a group of naughty children were competing with each other and fighting each other. There was a primary school student named Xu Zhiming, who was 13 years old. When he was fighting with another primary school student, Chen Da (43 years old), a worker from Changshu, happened to be sweeping the classroom. Seeing Xu Hai twisting people into a ball, he went to pull them apart. However, Xu Hai was naughty and stubborn, causing him to quarrel with Chen Da. Unexpectedly, Xu Zhiming kicked up a foot, and Chen Da didn't guard against it. He hit the vital part of his abdomen. Chen Da was injured and immediately fell to the ground. He cried out miserably and died of breath. The principal of the school was shocked when he learned about it. He immediately detained Xu Hai and reported it to the Jinjiachao Police Station of the Third District and Second Sub-bureau. He took Xu Hai out and sent him to the Third District and Second Sub-bureau. He found that it was rare for a child to kick a strong man to death. In addition to summoning his parents, Yang Musheng, the local guarantee of the 44th Map of Nian Erbao, was ordered to report to the local court for a post-mortem examination in the afternoon. The prosecutor will cross the Pu River today to investigate the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e140">The Cadres Arrested at the Wusong Machine Factory Will Be Released Within Days. The Two-Route Special Party Department Sends a Letter to the Garrison Command Stating the Facts. <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The cadres of the Wusong Machine Factory Trade Union Office of the Two Routes were arrested by the Road Bureau and sent to the Garrison Command on March 30. It has been nearly two weeks since then. It is learned that the Two-Route Special Party Department, in order to seek a proper solution to this case as soon as possible, "has separately telegraphed the Central Executive Committee, the Central Organization Committee, and Chairman Chiang, and the Ministry of Railways, and sent a letter to the Songhu Garrison Command, stating the truth of the facts and instructing the release of the innocent." The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Reply to the Garrison Headquarters <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>A letter from the Two-Route Special Party Headquarters replying to the Garrison Headquarters states: In reply to your department's legal document number 756, which contained a letter from the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration regarding the arrest of eleven suspected counter-revolutionaries, including Cao Wenkui, etc., the matter has been referred to the military law office for investigation according to the law. However, it is crucial to conduct a detailed investigation into the defendants' usual behavior and whether they have committed any crimes, to ensure a fair trial. Therefore, we request that you investigate the following four points in detail and reply to us for further action. We also wish to maintain our official relationship. Herein, we first describe the facts and provide answers to the inquiries and contribute our opinions for your reference. We enclose a letter for your review and fair handling. We also wish to maintain our official relationship.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Detailed Account of the Facts <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>On February 19th of last year, our headquarters received a report from the Wusong Machinery Factory Branch of the Railway Workers' Union, transferred by the Railway Union, alleging that Mo Heng, the chief of the General Affairs Department and the Materials Department of the railway, was slandering the Party and the nation, undermining the labor movement, abusing his power, and engaging in private corruption. We immediately dispatched personnel to pay attention to the workers' speeches and requested the Railway Administration to resolve the matter publicly. However, party departments and workers' unions at all levels along the two railways successively filed complaints against Mo Heng, petitioned the Railway Administration for a solution, but to no avail. The public sentiment was agitated, and there was an informal work stoppage. Subsequently, our headquarters, fearing that counter-revolutionaries would seize the opportunity during the Fujian Incident, reported the matter to the Central Party Headquarters and requested the Ministry of Railways to send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and handle the matter fairly. At the same time, we made every effort to persuade the workers, who fortunately understood the importance of the situation and quickly restored normal work conditions. As for Mo Heng's abuse of power, private corruption, slander of the Party and the nation, and undermining of the labor movement, we are still awaiting a fair investigation and handling by the Central Government and the Ministry of Railways. This is a general overview of the case.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Answering Each Question in Detail <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>(1) Are Cao Wenkui, Xu Shanqing, Li Kuikui, Lin Jinlin, Zhou Weixian, Han Weiyu, Chen Shusheng, Shi Zhenyuan, He Laixing, and Tang Genfa all cadres of the Wusong Machinery Factory Branch of the Two-Route Railway Workers' Union? Is their usual behavior honest, and do they have any counter-revolutionary leanings? After investigation, the above-mentioned people are indeed cadres of the Wusong Machinery Factory Branch of the Two-Route Railway Workers' Union. Among them, Xu Shanqing, Chen Shusheng, and He Laixing are members of our party, and Li Kuikui, Shi Zhenyuan, and Cao Wenkui are probationary members of our party. Their usual behavior is very honest, they work very hard, and they have no counter-revolutionary leanings. (2) Was the work slowdown by the factory workers in December of last year incited by these cadres, and was there any obstruction of military transport or collusion with the Fujian rebels? The informal work stoppage by the workers of the Wusong Machinery Factory in December of last year was entirely caused by Mo Heng, the chief of the General Affairs Department and the Materials Department of the railway, who slandered the Party and the nation, undermined the labor movement, abused his power, and engaged in private corruption. Party departments and workers' unions at all levels along the two railways all filed complaints against Mo Heng. The workers of the factory, due to their direct involvement, waited for Mo Heng to come to the factory to explain the situation. This was not something that the cadres could incite. Moreover, with over a thousand workers in the Wusong Machinery Factory, inciting a work slowdown was beyond the power of these cadres. As for obstructing military transport, it is absolutely not true. The Railway Administration informed our headquarters only that it almost obstructed military transport, so there was no actual implementation of obstructing military transport. Furthermore, the Wusong Machinery Factory specializes in repairing machinery and has nothing to do with train operations. How could there be any talk of obstructing military transport? In addition, during the Fujian rebellion, the employees of the two railways were deeply indignant. Mo Heng slandered the Party and the nation and undermined the labor movement. The workers believed that Mo Heng's words and actions were helping to fuel the rebellion, so they filed complaints against him, which was actually to eliminate counter-revolution. How could they collude with the Fujian rebels? The fact that our headquarters, considering the severity of the situation, persuaded the workers to resume work, and the workers immediately accepted, proves that they had no such intentions or actions. (3) Did Cao Wenkui and others incite Shanghai locomotive workers to go on strike during the work slowdown last year? Cao Wenkui and others are loyal members who work hard for party affairs and the labor movement, with outstanding results. When the Song Factory incident occurred, they regretted it themselves. The Shanghai locomotive workers sympathized with the Wusong workers for Mo Heng's improper measures, but there was no consistent trend. Moreover, this kind of expression of sympathy was not limited to the Shanghai locomotive workers; all employees of the railway had the same feeling. The facts are all there and can be verified. Our headquarters has not heard of this, nor is there any fact that can give rise to suspicion. If it is said that Cao Wenkui and others had the suspicion of inciting, then it is really an unfounded accusation. (Enclosed are letters and telegrams from subordinate party departments and branch offices, which have already been published in various newspapers, so they are omitted.) (4) Was the beating of newly dispatched officials and committee members of the Railway Administration by the cadres, or were they the instigators? The cadres have a deep faith in our party and are responsible for reporting news to standing committee member Chen Jiansu and special commissioner Cheng Shi. When Standing Committee Member Chen was hit by objects thrown by a small number of workers, most of the cadres were next to Committee Member Chen and stepped forward to protect him at the risk of their own lives. Several of them were also injured as a result. It is unreasonable to say that they were the instigators, and their actions are not allowed by the facts.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Filing Complaints and Being Beaten Are Two Separate Matters <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Last year's case of the Wusong Machinery Factory filing complaints against Mo Heng was purely due to Mo Heng's abuse of power, private corruption, slander of the Party and the nation, and undermining of the labor movement. The statements he made and the various points he reported before and after, as well as the results of the investigations by the Central Government and the Ministry of Railways, all prove that there was no counter-revolutionary behavior or facts. Our headquarters is close by, and we will never tolerate counter-revolutionaries. We have previously reported this in detail to the Central Government and the Ministry of Railways, requesting a fair investigation and handling. Three months have passed since the incident, and any emergency measures would not have been delayed until now. This time, the Railway Administration sent Qiu and Wang to the Song Factory to explain the situation to the workers together with our standing committee member Chen Chengshi in his personal capacity, and as a result, they were beaten. The Railway Administration took the opportunity to retaliate, which is very inappropriate. Not only does our headquarters believe that last year's case of filing complaints against Mo Heng and this time's case of Committee Member Chen Chengshi being beaten are two completely separate matters, but on the afternoon of the arrest of all the cadres of the factory, our headquarters sent Standing Committee Member Chen to ask the Railway Administration for the reason for the arrest. When Chen Bohua and Xue Jie, directors of the Two-Route Workers' Union, went to inquire, Director Huang repeatedly stated that the two cases were judged separately. Cao Wenkui was framed for supporting the Party and the nation and reporting corruption, which is even more unjust. We respectfully hope that you will investigate in detail and handle the matter fairly.</p>

<p>Cao Wenkui, Lin Jinlin, Li Kuikui, Tang Genfa, Xu Shanqing, Shi Genfa, Han Weiyu, Zhou Weixian, Chen Shusheng, He Laixing, etc., cadres of the Wusong Machinery Factory Workers' Union Office, were arrested by the Railway Administration's railway police and the Public Security Bureau police on March 30th and escorted onto a car to the Garrison Headquarters. Subsequently, the Two-Route Workers' Union, the Two-Route Special Party Headquarters, etc., petitioned the Central Government to order the Ministry of Railways to handle the matter fairly. At the same time, they sent personnel to the Garrison Headquarters to explain the facts orally and in writing. According to news released by the Two-Route Party Headquarters yesterday, the Central Government has already ordered the Garrison Headquarters to allow bail. It is expected that they will be able to regain their freedom within days.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Measures to Sanction Fellow Traders Not Joining Guild Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Requests Further Instructions <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on the joint presentation of various industries that fellow traders refuse to join the association, thus the organization of fellow trade associations cannot be sound, had previously requested the Ministry of Industry to formulate measures to sanction those who do not join the association to control the economy and other conditions. It has been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that the Ministry of Industry has approved the guild's request, stating that it has no right to formulate sanctioning measures itself. The guild should, based on the "Nanjing Industrial and Commercial Guild Law" drafted by the Ministry, "After the Social Affairs Bureau verifies that the same-trade companies have not completed the membership registration procedures, they will be punished in accordance with the Administrative Execution Law." Report to the Ministry of Industry whether to use it or not. The two original texts of the approval and presentation are divided as follows:</p>
<p>The approval of the Ministry of Industry has been fully understood. The establishment of industrial and commercial associations is based on Article 2 of the Industrial and Commercial Association Law, which aims to maintain and enhance the public interests of the same industry. Companies and businesses should be happy to comply. Therefore, Article 7 of the same law only mentions that they should be members, and there are no provisions for sanctioning those who are not members. Moreover, since the law has not granted this Ministry the power to formulate implementation measures, this Ministry shall not formulate them without authorization. The previous presentation from the Chamber of Commerce has already been clearly instructed. It should still be handled in accordance with the previous order. This order.</p>
<p>The presentation of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is for the purpose of presenting matters. It is found that the explanation requested by the subordinate association last time refers to the fact that if it has not joined the association, it cannot be punished in accordance with the articles of association, which seems to be different from the tone of the approval of your department this time. However, based on what your department said that the law has not granted the power to implement the measures, according to the Central Daily News published on March 25 this year, the Nanjing Industrial and Commercial Guild, which was jointly drafted by the Central Mass Movement Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau of your department and approved for record, the Provisional Measures for Re-election or Reorganization in accordance with the law, Article 5 of which states, "Companies and businesses in the same industry shall join the guild as members in accordance with the law. Those who have not yet joined the guild shall complete the registration within the time limit notified by each guild." Article 6 also states, "After each guild handles the supplementary registration, if there are still companies in the same industry that have not completed the membership registration procedures, they will be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification and punished in accordance with the Administrative Execution Law, and the business license of the company may be revoked." Based on the above situation, the power to deal with companies that refuse to join the association lies with the official government, and there are precedents. The affairs of Beijing and Shanghai are the same. Whether or not to follow the example, the reasoning is combined to write a presentation to your department for review, and the government gives approval and obeys. If it is deemed feasible, please also order the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to handle it, which is really convenient for the public.</p>

In addition, 3,458 880 factory strips were produced (3,400 strips were transferred to the Central Bank), which is in line with those stamped by the committee. (2) Name of Silver and Amount of Copper Used It was found that the factory sent daily silver ingot melting reports (regarding the one-yuan silver part) and Class B factory strip casting reports in February, which have been individually calculated and compiled.

<p>According to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the quantity of tea exported and transshipped in the first quarter of this year (from January to March) was 72,623.67 quintals (1 quintal is equal to 1.6535 dan in the old system), compared with 77,769.66 quintals in the same quarter last year, a decrease of more than 5,000 quintals. Among them, those directly exported from Shanghai were 25,131.75 quintals, a decrease of about 1,400 quintals (26,479.74 quintals last year), and those transshipped from this port were 47,491.92 quintals, a decrease of nearly 4,000 quintals (51,289.92 quintals last year). In terms of tea exports, green tea accounted for 21,046.20 quintals, an increase of about 900 quintals compared with last year (20,181.09 quintals). Black tea exports were 4,825.86 quintals, a decrease compared with last year (5,319.02 quintals) of about 500 quintals. Brick tea exports were 45,021.28 quintals, the largest decrease, reaching 3,600 quintals. The output of other teas was also 1,800 quintals less. In terms of exports to other countries, except for a slight increase in the United Kingdom, the rest have declined, especially Russia and the United States. The transaction of foreign tea in the spring is usually idle. Last year's export increase was due to the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, which happened to be the opportunity, and the export of brick tea increased greatly. Since the beginning of this year, the tea market abroad has been sluggish, and the accumulation in Africa is relatively abundant, resulting in a sharp drop in tea prices and a standstill in transactions. Although exports are less than last year, they are still more than in the previous year, because it was rumored in February that the French government would increase tea taxes from April, so tea merchants actively loaded and transported to avoid the loss of increased taxes.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Machinery-Made National Goods Factory Federation, in view of the fact that the Mei Ya labor dispute has not been resolved and the situation is dangerous, which is worrying, telegraphed the municipal government and various party and government agencies yesterday to find ways to eliminate it in order to maintain the industry. The telegram from the federation to Mayor Wu is as follows: Dear Sir, I recently received a letter from the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory, (the original text has been seen in various newspapers), etc., to the meeting. Since foreign goods are dumped, domestic industry and commerce have been extremely panicked. Both labor and management should understand each other to compete for survival. However, the Mei Ya factory has developed an unprecedented large-scale labor dispute due to the small problem of reducing wages. Whether or not there is northern scenery manipulation in the report that the Mei Ya factory workers besieged the Social Affairs Bureau for as long as 19 hours is not mentioned here, but the dangerous situation is obvious. I respectfully read President Chiang Kai-shek's brilliant circular, which prohibits strikes and work slowdowns, which is an essential measure during the national crisis. The factory's painful situation in this Mei Ya labor dispute is overflowing with words. I hope that your Excellency will make a wise decision to avoid the long-term labor-management comparison, to maintain the precarious industry, and to eliminate the hidden worries and lurking labor disputes. The Shanghai Machinery-Made National Goods Factory Federation,</p>

<p>Pan Lanshi, a famous scholar in Lingnan, was seventy-six years old this year. He was in good spirits, but he died suddenly due to a stroke after falling. Those who heard about it regretted it. There are quite a few things to say about his funeral. (1) Pan had many writings in his life, and in recent years he selected them into ten volumes, which were published by his disciple Tan Junren. A clear copy was completed a few days ago, and he personally discussed the final draft with Yao Jun Yuqin. He died suddenly on the evening of his return, which is very strange. (2) Pan was very devout in Buddhism in his daily life. A few days ago, he wrote the four words "Let go of everything" and gave them to his friend Ling Jun, and firmly instructed his family members not to cry when he died, but to recite the name of Buddha in unison, and could not move until eight hours later. His family has followed his orders. This is another matter. (3) There were many male and female disciples. They privately called Pan "Mr. Jingyi". Pan was upright throughout his life and did not seek fame and fortune. He lived in Shanghai for forty years and made a living by selling his writings. He also did not like to associate with wealthy people. Those who commented said that the two words "Jingyi" could be worth Pan's guilt. Pan had three sons, the eldest doing business in Hong Kong, the second working as an assistant in a Western medical clinic in Hong Kong, and the third working in the Qiongzhou Customs. This time, Pan went from illness to death. His family and friends sent three telegrams to Hong Kong urging him to come, and only received a reply of "Abandoning his job and coming to Shanghai, he would have nothing to eat" eight words. It was not possible to help him with the funeral by helping his relatives and friends. It is said that in this time of moral decay, it is not surprising that the father's death is not cared for. Only the eight words in the telegram are very humorous. Fortunately, Pan was broad-minded before his death, even if he had this order, he might not be able to close his eyes, cloud.</p>

<p>Since the Chinese people changed their mentality and began smoking domestic cigarettes, Chinese tobacco companies have responded to the urgent needs of society by actively developing. The recent announcement in various newspapers of the Guanghua brand of Chinese standard cigarettes, which will be released soon, has sparked speculation among people. Many believe that only a powerful tobacco company could produce it. News from the cigarette industry says that it is a new contribution from the China Huamei Tobacco Company. When the company was first established, it operated two types of cigarettes, Red and Blue "Maisigan," which have been famous throughout the country for half a year. This new product, judging from its slogan "Chinese Standard Cigarette," must be extraordinary. What it is really like will be evaluated after it is released.</p>

<p>The Chinese Wrestling Association is an organization dedicated to promoting and publicizing the national art of wrestling. It was established in June of last year. Although it has not been long, its achievements have been remarkable. Recently, in view of the fact that wrestling has been adopted as one of the physical education textbooks for middle schools by the Textbook Compilation Committee of the Ministry of Education, but there are not many books on wrestling research in China, the president of the association, the famous martial artist Tong Zhongyi, has compiled a book on Chinese wrestling methods, with photography and printing by the up-and-coming artist Hong Zhifang. The book elaborates on wrestling methods and the principles of force in a very thorough manner. Enthusiastic physical educators, such as party and state figures Chu Minyi and Zhang Zhijiang, director of the Central Guoshu Institute, have highly praised it and have presented calligraphic prefaces. It is said that it is currently being typeset and printed and will be published next month. Another book, "Wrestling Competition Refereeing Method," is being compiled by Zhang Weichuan, a member of the association. After the manuscript is completed, it will be submitted to the Central Guoshu Institute for review and will be released.</p>

<p>Pig intestines were originally a type of export trade. In previous years, the export volume was quite considerable in the trade books. However, this year's business has plummeted, greatly affected by the global economic downturn. Germany, the United States, and other countries have stopped importing, resulting in business stagnation. In addition, no one consults about fresh intestines in this port. Therefore, the industry colleagues held an emergency meeting at the association's office on Sanma Road yesterday and resolved to submit a request to the Social Bureau to be forwarded to the Ministry of Industry for relief.</p>

<p>The Da Xin Silk and Satin Shop on Sanma Road and Shilu Road has decided to reorganize into the Da Xin National Goods Company to meet social needs. Because it must sell the shop base within a limited time, it is holding a grand sale of its stored silk goods. Business has been bustling in recent days, with daily turnover exceeding 7,000 to 8,000 yuan, which is indeed due to the fact that goods are high quality and prices are low. However, the deadline is approaching, and the inventory has not yet been cleared. In order to quickly conclude the business, the shop has decided to offer a further 10% discount on all items in the grand sale every day from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, making a great sacrifice for one hour. This is an unprecedented event and a rare opportunity. Since the shop is willing to make such a sacrifice, it should not be difficult to clear out the remaining goods in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e168">Another Example of Studying International Issues (4) <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>However, we can also say with certainty here that this compromise is indeed extremely harsh on the Chinese nation. It clearly pushes the Chinese nation into the possibility of becoming a colony, which is a point that every researcher should be very wary of.</p>
<p>The above is naturally just a summary of the research on this topic. Please carry out a more detailed review yourself! This is a very interesting issue. We would also like to ask Mr. Zhao to compare the key points and research methods we have put forward with the opinions and views of the "international affairs commentator" that Mr. Zhao referred to. Where are the differences between us?</p>
<p>From this, we can see that theoretical learning is indeed not easy, and theoretical application is even more difficult. From this, we realize that purely abstract theoretical research can only make us scholars in the study, which is not very useful for the "people of the world." On the contrary, we can only truly grasp the theory from all practices, which has truly become an undeniable truth. But the former is easier to engage in, while the latter requires a lot of hard work. For example, in recent years, quite a few books on historical materialism have been introduced to China, but there are very few who can use it to apply to China's actual situation. What China needs now has gone beyond the boundaries of purely studying principles. Especially for people like us who live this kind of life, even if we want to read a few books on the original theory, it must be to apply it, so here, the editor has to specially propose that readers pay more attention to application, learn must apply, and don't just hold on to dead books.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao's letter naturally also gave ordinary readers an opportunity to learn how to observe international issues. However, Mr. Zhao's letter also proves that the few articles we wrote before have not been fully understood by readers, or at least cannot be used to apply. We again propose to the readers, if you feel that some books on principles are difficult to read, it is best to pay more attention to the illustrated examples of using correct methods, that is, articles on research in various aspects. The things in the "Reading Q&amp;A" column, of course, there are some that are worth reading by you.</p>
<p>In addition, we also hope that readers can put forward some of their own experiments in using methods to us (we should not be afraid of mistakes, afraid of being naive). Let us further promote the combination of reading true theory and practice in our lives.</p>

Looking at the preliminary selection in North China, the testing in Nanjing, and the hard work of the athletes in Shanghai, the production of records will not be difficult like spring shoots after the rain. However, the weather is not good, with continuous rain and a particularly changeable climate, as if it were the middle of winter. This greatly disappoints the athletes. I sincerely hope that the clouds will dissipate today and that we can see the sun. This is what the athletes and spectators are all praying for. The preliminary selection order is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Shot Put 2:00 PM</p>
<p>(2) Long Jump 2:00 PM</p>
<p>(3) 100 Meters 2:15 PM</p>
<p>(4) 800 Meters 2:30 PM</p>
<p>(5) Pole Vault 2:30 PM</p>
<p>(6) High Hurdles 2:45 PM</p>
<p>(7) 10,000 Meters 3:00 PM</p>
<p>(8) Discus 3:00 PM</p>
<p>(9) High Jump 3:15 PM</p>
<p>(10) Intermediate Hurdles 3:45 PM</p>
<p>(11) Javelin 3:45 PM</p>
<p>(12) 400 Meters 3:05 PM</p>
<p>(13) Triple Jump 3:55 PM</p>
<p>(14) 1,500 Meters 4:10 PM</p>
<p>(15) 200 Meters 4:20 PM</p>
<p>(Note) (1) After each competition, the selection committee will select representatives based on the individual results. (2) The Decathlon will not be held separately and is cancelled.</p>

<p>For the track and field competition, talent selection does not count points but purely selects the best individual results and submits them to the selection committee to select the attending representatives. Athletes are expected to receive their number bibs at the Xie Jin Association office this morning. Entrance tickets are uniformly six dimes and can be entered through the Sapporo Road entrance. Entrance tickets for the evening basketball game are uniformly one dollar.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Basketball Preliminary Selection: Shanghai and Hubei First to Meet Tonight; Hubei Has Famous Players Who May Surprise <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The Far Eastern Games basketball preliminary selection has four teams: North China, Hubei, Nanjing, and Shanghai. The order has been arranged. Tonight, the first battle will be Shanghai vs. Hubei, starting at 8:00 PM on the newly built open-air floor of the baseball field. The Shanghai team has strong strength, while Hubei province also has many strong players, such as Yu Jingxiao and Chen Shengkui, who are famous throughout the country. Intense struggles at that time are expected. Tickets are uniformly one dollar and can be entered through Ma Lang Road. Referees: Jin Zhaojun, Wu Jiatang.</p>
<h3 id="e177">List of Four Teams Participating in Preliminary Selection <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Hubei team includes Chen Shengkui, a famous general who attended the Far Eastern Games in the past, Yu Jingxiao, a center from the Hebei team who won the National Games championship last year, and Wu Guolin, a former star from Shanghai's Hujiang University. Their strength is very strong and should not be underestimated.

<p>The Nanjing team is a collection of elites from the National Guard Sports Academy, the Central Military Academy, the Public Rest (i.e., Qingguang), and the Central University. Their strength is no less than that of other teams. However, Wei Haiqing, Xian Zhuanghuai, and Li Chunfeng from the Public Rest team are unable to leave Nanjing due to circumstances, which inevitably has a slight impact. The names of the remaining nine players are as follows: Wu Wenzhong, Gao Changming, Zhang Changjiang, Zhang Changchun, Li Gongyu, Wang Shixuan, Liu Mengjiu, Xu Biao, Long Jialu.</p>
<p>The North China team is composed of famous players from Beijing and Tianjin and has undergone long-term training. It is considered the strongest of the four teams and is listed as a basic team with the special privilege of directly entering the finals without attending the preliminary rounds. The team has twelve members as follows: Tang Baokun, Liu Zhenyuan, Liu Xueqi, Wang Hongbin, Zhang Jing Shi, Li Zhenzhong, Yin Hongxiang, Wang Yuzeng, Wang Kanruo, Wang Xiliang, Zhang Yucai, Mou Zuoyun.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Open-Air Court Installation Completed <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>After the Chinese Basketball Hall was burned down, a temporary open-air court was set up in front of the special grandstand of the baseball field for this preliminary selection. It was built day and night and has now been completed. However, due to the lack of time to install electric lights, gasoline lamps are used instead. It was originally planned to have sixteen lamps, but last night's test showed that the light was too dim. It was decided to divide them into six lines, with six lamps per line, for a total of thirty lamps, which should provide ample light. The grandstand will be equipped with electric lights because the competition will be held in the evening.</p>

<p>According to the initial regulations of the National Sports Association for men's volleyball, there will be no separate selection. The Shanghai team, which won the National Games championship last year, will be the basic team, and good players from Hong Kong and Guangdong will be selected to join the team. However, according to Xu Nihui, a veteran who just arrived in Shanghai from Guangzhou, the volleyball teams of Guangdong and Hong Kong have decided to combine to form the South China team to compete with Shanghai. They have already booked passage on the Russian Empress and are expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 18th or 19th. The date of the selection competition will be around the 20th. This unexpected competition will definitely add a lot of color to the national preliminary selection.</p>

<p>It was originally planned to invite overseas Chinese from Honolulu to return to China to participate in the baseball team, but that team cannot return to China, and the Chinese Sports Association has not announced the selection method for a long time. Therefore, there are rumors that the baseball team will not be sent to participate. According to the person in charge of the Sports Association, China has decided to send a team to participate. The selection of personnel will be handled by the committee members, such as Liu Dacheng, who have full authority to select good players from Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, Hong Kong, Guangdong, etc., to organize the team. There will be no separate preliminary selection.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Philippine Attitude Remains Unchanged Regarding the Issue of the Puppet State Participating in the Far East Games Does Not Want Any Country to Violate the Articles of Association Hopes Japan Will Participate in This Year's Games Executive Committee to Meet Today to Respond to Japan Statement by Vice President of the Philippine Sports Association <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the negotiations between the Philippines and Japan, according to a Japanese dispatch, the Philippine Sports Association will hold an executive committee meeting today to discuss a response to the protest from the Japanese Sports Association. According to general observations, the Philippine side's attitude will remain unchanged. Vargas, Vice President of the Philippine Sports Association, issued a statement saying that the Philippines will act in accordance with the articles of association of the Games and does not want any country to violate the constitution of the Games.</p>
<p>Vice President of the Philippine Sports Association Announces Attitude (Jiji News Agency, Manila, 3rd) Vargas, Vice President of the Philippine Sports Association, issued a statement late on the 12th, explaining the attitude of the Philippine representatives at the round table conference in Shanghai. At the same time, he hoped that Japan would participate in this year's Games. The content roughly stated that if Japan had any new proposals, we would naturally consider them. We sincerely hope that Japan will come to the Philippines to participate in the Games. Speaker of the Upper House, Kane, is currently on his way back to the Philippines from the United States. Because Kane also serves as the President of the Sports Association, I will telegraph Kane to clarify the Philippine position to the Japanese Sports Association when he arrives. The Japanese Sports Association's inquiry telegram has been received. This association will hold a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Sports Association at 9:00 a.m. on the 14th to discuss countermeasures and decide on a reply. Before Dr. Tan went to Shanghai to attend the round table conference, this association instructed him to vote in favor of the puppet state's participation, but refused to adopt a majority vote system. A unanimous decision is required because we do not want any country to trample on the constitution of the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<p>The Philippine Sports Association Will Still Take the Established Policy (Jiji News Agency, Manila, 13th) The issue of the puppet state participating in the Far East Games caused a sudden dispute due to the breakdown of the round table conference in Shanghai. Vargas, Vice President of the Philippine Sports Association, will convene a standing committee meeting on the 14th to decide on the final attitude towards this issue. According to general observations, the Philippine Sports Association will follow the established policy and decide to unanimously decide on the puppet state's participation.</p>
<p>Japanese Sports Association Telegraphed Philippine Sports Association Again (Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 13th) Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese Sports Association received a telegram from Yamamoto, the representative in Shanghai, requesting that the content of the inquiry sent by the Japanese Sports Association to the Philippine Sports Association the day before be revised. It also received a telegram from Yamamoto to the Philippine Sports Association, requesting that the inquiry letter issued by the Japanese Sports Association be temporarily reserved. The executives of the Sports Association immediately held an executive meeting at the Central Pavilion yesterday afternoon. As a result of the discussion, it was clear that the Philippine side was distrustful, so an inquiry should be sent. They also telegraphed Representative 本 to immediately lift the request for the Philippines to reserve the inquiry letter. At 7 p.m., they continued to hold an emergency board meeting at the Marunouchi Hotel. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to explain that the points pointed out by Representative Yamamoto were not the main points of the inquiry to the Philippines, and to telegraph the Philippines again, recognizing the ultimatum of the previous night as valid. The meeting adjourned at 0:40 a.m. The main points of the re-telegram to the Philippines are as follows: It is said that Representative Yamamoto telegraphed your association to cancel the telegram sent by the Japanese Sports Association the previous night. This was due to a failure to understand the main parts of the previous telegram. This association does not require the puppet state's membership, only hopes to invite it to participate. Although there is no such provision in the constitution of the Games, there is a precedent for India's participation. Those who wish to participate should be carefully considered and cannot be rejected outright. Regarding this point, it is hoped that your association will reflect.</p>
<p>Ilanan Advocates Rejecting Japan's Proposal (Jiji News Agency, Manila, 13th) The Japanese Sports Association telegraphed the Philippine Sports Council, accusing it of breaking its promise, and telegraphed again on the 12th, urging it to invite the puppet state to participate in this Far East Games. Today, Mr. Ilanan, who is in charge of the Philippine Sports Association, made a statement on the 13th regarding this so-called new proposal, as follows: The Japanese Sports Association's proposal cites the practices before the current implementation, saying that the participation of a country does not require a unanimous vote and that the puppet state should be invited and allowed to participate in advance, but the Philippines will never recognize it, no matter how much it is urged. I believe that the Philippine Sports Council will naturally reject this kind of request.</p>
<p>Yamamoto and Matsuzawa Returned to Japan from Shanghai Yesterday (Jiji News Agency, Tokyo, 13th) Representatives Yamamoto and Matsuzawa took the Nagasaki Maru from Shanghai on the 13th and returned to Japan. They are scheduled to arrive in Tokyo at 5 p.m. on the 15th.</p>
<p>Japan Postponed the Far East Preliminary Selection Today (Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 13th) The Far East Games Preparatory Committee has decided to postpone the All-Japan Preliminary Selection Conference scheduled to be held on the 14th until the Philippine Sports Association replies and the Japanese Sports Association decides on its attitude.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Wang Zhengting Returns to Shanghai to Discuss Implementing Established Positions Modifying the Articles of Association of the Far East Games Must Also Be Approved by All <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting, Vice President of the Far East Games, returned to Shanghai from Beiping yesterday. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency visited the Liuhe Man Coal Mining Company and asked for his opinion on the Far East Games and the issue of modifying the articles of association. According to Wang, his opinion has already been stated briefly. China should only implement its established position on this matter. Japan wants to expand this issue, and we should deal with it calmly. As for modifying the articles of association, it must also be approved by all to take effect.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Far East Games Football South China Preliminary Selection First Game Hong Kong Beats Guangzhou One to Zero Hong Kong Good at Attacking Guangzhou Good at Defending Li Huitang Contributes to Hong Kong Team <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The South China team preliminary selection for the Far East Games football, which has been prepared by both the Guangdong and Hong Kong sides for more than a month, was held at the South China Athletic Association Stadium on Caroline Hill in Hong Kong at 4 p.m. on the 8th. The second preliminary selection competition will be held in Guangzhou on the 14th. After the two preliminary selections are completed, the Guangdong and Hong Kong Sports Associations will carefully select the team, and then a joint team from Guangdong and Hong Kong will compete against the Shanghai joint team. Then, the elite players will be selected from the two teams to form the Chinese football team to attend the Far East Games and compete with teams from the Philippines, Japan, the Netherlands, India, etc.</p>
<p>Guangdong Team Loses Key Players On the 8th, the Guangdong team was forced to replace four key players, Chen Zhenhe, Xu Yahui, Mai Zhaohan, and Li Guozhao, with Huang Ruikai, Liu Qingcai, Li Jin, and Xiao Dianlian. The strength was inevitably affected. Fortunately, there were three key players in the back, Li Tiansheng, Tan Jiangbai, and Huang Jiliang, to defend, so there was no need to worry about the rear. If these three key players had not been working for the Guangdong team, the Hong Kong team could have done whatever it wanted. The opposing players are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangzhou Team</p>
<p>Huang Ruikai Ye Beihua</p>
<p>Tan Jiangbai Xiao Dianlian</p>
<p>Huang Shaoliang Liu Qingcai Feng Jingxiang</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Zhu Guolun</p>
<p>Li Jin Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team</p>
<p>Li Guowei Feng Qingyu</p>
<p>Liu Mao Zheng Jiliang</p>
<p>Huang Huaji Liang Rongzhao Li Huitang</p>
<p>Liang Xianzhan He Jiaqiang</p>
<p>He Zuoxian Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>Hong Kong Nearly in Danger At the beginning of the war, the Guangzhou side took advantage of the wind, and Feng Jingxiang, Hua Beihua, and Yang Shuiyi were quite active for a while. Feng Jingxiang picked left and right, galloping horizontally and vertically, and charging repeatedly. The Hong Kong side was almost in danger. Later, the Hong Kong team's central defenders stepped up their operations, and the arrogance of the Guangdong team was slightly reduced. Gradually, the morale of the Hong Kong team was better than that of the Guangdong team. At that time, Cao Guicheng, the flying general on the right wing, ran forward with the help of Liang Zhaozhi, the red-faced public in the middle. Li Huitang and Zheng Jiliang also advanced forward. All the capable players of the Hong Kong team gathered in front of the Guangdong team's formation. If it were not for Huang Jiliang's courage and wisdom, the Guangdong team would have lost its territory long ago.</p>
<p>No Win or Loss in the First Half After twenty minutes, Guangzhou relied on the wind again and rushed in, with Ye Beihua on the left and Feng Jingxiang in the middle making close contact. Song Guolun was also active, and the morale was boosted. During the melee, the referee Ou Jiesheng suddenly blew his whistle, indicating that the Hong Kong team had committed a handball near the goal seventeen yards away. This ball was kicked by the Guangdong team. Liu Qingcai concentrated and thought of the arrow successfully, but he used too much force, and the ball flew into the air. In the first half, Yang Shuiyi was extremely dutiful, but Li Guowei watched closely at all times, preventing him from shielding, which is a pity. In the second half, He Jiaqiang of the Hong Kong team did not play, and was supplemented by the fresh force Qu Bingming. The combat power was not affected much, and with the advantage of the wind, the ball king and the flying general were more active and completely occupied the advantage. The central defender line of the Guangzhou team almost lost its ability to resist, and the rear defenders Li and Tan felt exhausted. When it was eighteen minutes, the ball king Li Huitang got the ball from Zheng Jiliang's plate and shot it hard. The ball entered from the right corner of the goal, because of his strength, Jiliang finally could not save it. The audience was celebrating for the Hong Kong team.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team Wins After the victory, the Guangzhou team tried to counterattack again and again, but was repeatedly repelled by the central defender line and could not succeed. In any case, the referee Ou Jiesheng's war whistle rang long, and the twenty-two warriors also obeyed the order to rest. In terms of individual skills, Feng Jingxiang, Li Tiansheng, and Tan 澕柏 of Guangzhou were the most outstanding. Ye Beihua's skills remained the same after the illness, but his strength was slightly worse, and he did not seem as brave as before. Huang Jiliang's defense was beyond reproach. Except for Liu Qingqing, the central defender seemed to have nothing to take. Li Huitang, Zheng Jiliang, and Cao Guicheng of the Hong Kong team performed the best. The central defender line Liang Rongzhao and Li Guowei were also not inferior. He Zuoxian was too weak, and Liang Xuanzan, the defender, had the same disease. Liu Mao also performed well. The goalkeeper Huang Huangji belonged to the B team of the South China, but the battle was generally good that day. It is intended that Huang is also a trainable material.</p>
<p>Ideal Lineup for South China As for the ideal lineup for the match between South China and East China, as far as I can see, it should be as follows: Goalkeeper Bao Jiaping or Huang Jiliang, defenders Li Tiansheng and Liu Mao, central defenders Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Xu Yahui or Chen Zhenhe, forwards Ye Beihua, Li Huitang learn Feng Jingxiang, Zheng Jiliang, Cao Guicheng. As for the Far East players, it will be decided after East China arrives in Hong Kong and competes with South China.</p>
<p>Four Knights Difficult to Attend As for the list of the South China team, it will be decided after the second game. According to Zhou Runnian, the secretary of the South China Athletic Association, the Hong Kong team has decided to go to Guangdong this month to compete with the Guangzhou team. After the competition is completed, the South China team can be selected to compete against East China. Regarding the issue that the four knights cannot attend, the reporter asked Feng Jingxiang specifically. According to him, the four of them work in the same place. If they all attend the fast transport, it may be difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>Chen Bulei, Director of the Education Department, has always been weak and has suffered from neurasthenia for many years. Since his illness last year, his physical condition has not recovered. The old illness occurs from time to time, and he has felt increasingly overwhelmed since the beginning of spring. Feeling that his sick body cannot bear the heavy responsibility for a long time, he has already earnestly resigned from all his current positions to the Executive Yuan yesterday, and separately submitted them to the Ministry of Education and the Provincial Government for forwarding. The letter of resignation stated, "An old illness occurs frequently, and recently it has been getting worse. Even slightly complicated affairs make me exhausted. In public, I cannot work consistently; in private, I am physically and mentally exhausted. I earnestly request permission to resign in order to emphasize public affairs," and so on. Chen had repeatedly requested to resign last year due to illness, but was retained by the various parties in the Yuan, Ministry, and Provincial Government, and was unable to obtain permission. It is reported that this time the intention to resign is extremely firm. In addition to formally submitting the request, he also met with Chairman Lu in person to earnestly explain the reasons for his request to retire. He also sent a personal letter to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, detailing his physical weakness and the suffering that forced him to seek retirement, and earnestly requested him to convey his wishes to the Yuan to ensure that the Central Government understood and approved his request.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Watching the Waterfall at Five Vents (Part 1) <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>Arrived in 　　 City last night, watching the sunset 　 disappear, but not die, then dragging 　　　, out of the South Gate, along the Huansha Creek, went to the ancient 　　 Village 　 and visited the small Xishi Temple. Right here, I painfully witnessed the tragedy of the middle-aged nun 　　　 the young girl with hair in the Buddhist hall, and could not muster the mood of a poet to see the brilliant sunset spring scenery on the Golden Rooster Mountain across the river. I had to pick up a few red leaves that were not completely withered, and returned to the hotel to write a letter to Manli in Shanghai, but there was a bit of loneliness in the mood. So I didn't even bother with supper, and just took out the quilt to sleep, keeping my eyes open until dawn. This day was clear and refreshing, making people happy.</p>
<p>At about seven o'clock in the morning, I took a rickshaw and left the verdant ancient city, immersed in the misty sky all the way, following the Youlong Mountains north. Thrushes were singing in the mountains, quiet and cold. By the time I reached Caota Town, the sun had turned silver-gray. The scenery was so good all the way to Qingkou. To get from Qingkou to Five Vents Temple, you have to cross eighteen water streams. If it is not a dry season, you must hire a cradle-like bamboo raft, sit inside, and have porters carry you across the stream. But when I went, it had been sunny for more than a month, so I went barefoot, wearing straw sandals, rolled up my trousers, and leisurely passed through the stream. Only three miles away, the Five Vents Chan Temple came into view.</p>
<p>The Five Vents Temple was originally named Yong'an Temple. Anyone who comes to see the waterfall must eat and stay here due to time constraints. We went in and made arrangements with the monk Yinhong. After eating a meat lunch, we went to find the waterfall. The monks here do not abstain from killing, nor do they recite scriptures. They wear their hair on the left side, just like ordinary people.</p>
<p>The so-called Five Vents is a waterfall originating from Zikai Village. It refers to the spring water that gushes out from the various rock crevices in five upper and lower, winding stages. Under the guidance of the monk Yinhong, we went out of the north gate of the temple, walked a hundred steps on the stone road, and climbed a few steps of the Niudun Mountain. It was all bamboo forest, with green leaves covering the sky, but a wisp of sunlight flowed out from the shade, shining on the mountain path, as if printing a few floating white flowers. At this time, in the midst of ten thousand bamboos, we heard a loud spring sound. The closer we got, the louder the sound became. We were all looking up at the mountain, searching for the thunderous sound, but Yinhong tilted his head, stopped his feet, stretched out a finger, and pointed to the left, saying:</p>
<p>"Isn't that the Fifth Vent?"</p>
<p>Everyone was immediately surprised and stood still. Looking intently, a silver-shining python was hanging down on the towering stone wall, so thick and angrily, flying down from the air, hitting the eaves, making a fierce roar.</p>
<p>"Wow! Great!" I shouted, walking down the stone beach to the left, planning to sit there and watch it to my heart's content.</p>
<p>"There are even greater ones. Follow me, friends!" The monk was also interesting. He quickly walked up to Xiangtie Ridge, not using a cane, but running fast. We had no choice but to follow. The bold sound of the waterfall still remained in our ears, and the snow-white color of the spring still flowed before our eyes. I really didn't know what the so-called greater one was like? A curious mood encouraged my legs, not asking for mercy at all, and not resting at all, and actually made it up half the mountain in one breath, and there was no road here. We entered the path between the bushes and went down through the thorns. The green grass that no one had stepped on was very slippery. The grass grew so high that it often swallowed the whole body. The small figures were faintly visible in the dense bushes, and the sound of "rustling" came out. Only heard a scream in front, and the man slipped and fell, and then someone fell again, and all the canes almost lost their effectiveness.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Watching the Waterfall at Five Vents (Part 2) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>With great difficulty, we climbed to the top of the mountain and looked down, seeing the hanging waterfall of the Second Vent, divided into two strands, hitting obliquely on the stone, rushing into the square pool. The locals call this pool the Coffin Pool. The water jumped out of the pool and flowed down the stone slope for twenty or thirty feet, just like the rushing of the Tianqiao Waterfall in Mount Lushan. From here, turning to the left and down, we saw a stone gap like a dragon's head, followed by a stone slab with holes, just like a wellhead, with two rows of waterfalls hanging in the mouth. The momentum was surging, spewing snow and splashing jade, and thousands of flowers of water rose and fell, like an old dragon coughing there. This is the First Vent. After watching for a long time, the sound of the spring was not very majestic, probably because it was too far away. Then we climbed down the dangerous cliff, using our hearts and minds in the vines, climbing down step by step, holding a cane in one hand and grabbing the wild grass with thorns in the other. Blood oozed out of the skin drop by drop, but I forgot the pain. I was paying attention to my greater life, hanging on a small tree on a hundred-foot cliff, on a clump of wild grass. I also trembled and looked down at the deep abyss. I was crawling on the upright stone wall. What if... ah! I dare not think, what if any one of my hands lost its grip? What if the small holly tree that my foot was stepping on was uprooted? What if the stone corner that my hand was holding loosened and rolled down! Wow! Today I know the true meaning of traveling in the mountains! Do people sitting in sedan chairs smoking cigars understand the dangerous peaks and bad valleys? No wonder Li Daoyuan of the Waterways Classic talked about "the middle three vents cannot be reached"! And now the literati who write travelogues about the Five Vents are still picking up Li Daoyuan's stale words and dare not experience the dangers themselves, which is really embarrassing!</p>
<p>As a result of our hands and feet working together, we finally reached the Third Vent. The Third Vent is a two-fold flying spring, flowing over the large stones covered with accumulated algae, horizontally and vertically five or six feet wide, all rushing straight down urgently, just like the flood that suddenly broke through Zhanggongchang in Hankou the year before last; this place is full of ocher red large stones, black large stones, and tea green large stones, all horizontally and obliquely up and down. Walking on them, you will meet straw shoes, and if you are not careful, you will slip and fall. Therefore, when climbing down, you have to lean your back against the stone and slowly slide down, and when getting up, you have to tightly cover your chest on the stone and try your best to lift your weight with both hands to succeed. As for the cane, because both it and the stone are hard things, they cannot bear the force, so you must not use it. The rushing flying spring washes these slippery stones day and night. It is poured into the stone crevices and flows to the empty valley. This is the Third Vent, which is the widest of the Five Vents.</p>
<p>Tiptoeing on the big stones, we arduously crossed the Third Vent. In front of the wind, there was a loud sound of the waterfall, but we couldn't see the shadow. This is the Fourth Vent. Seeing a black stone crouching on the side, like a majestic crouching tiger; we climbed up one after another. Climbing on the stone tip that was facing the ground and was full of water, we stretched out our heads and peered into the stone cave that looked like two doors. We only saw the side of a cluster of flying waterfalls, not knowing where it drifted out from, tending to the deep pool, rushing down in two folds, urgently and rapidly, and its momentum was irresistible. This is the most dangerous of the Five Vents. Standing there, the world was completely surrounded by the sound of the spring, and we were described as being particularly small and particularly weak.</p>
<p>It is a pity that such a mountain tour, even life is at risk of sacrifice at any time, it is inconvenient to carry a camera to take it into the lens, it is really a pity!</p>
<p>That night, I stayed in the wild temple of Donglongqiu and had a tired and terrifying spring dream.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Traveling Gear <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>Traveling and playing in the water is the only pleasure in life. If it can be relieved with traveling gear, then the pleasure will last longer. Westerners have a basket that combines knives, forks, cups, plates, water bottles, wine flagons, etc., for use when traveling for a picnic; there is also a kind of travel stool, made in a triangular shape and made of canvas, which can be folded up and used as a walking stick. The manufacturing is very precise, which is convenient for tourists. In recent years, travel groups in our country have sprung up like mushrooms. On good days in spring and autumn, boats and vehicles are endless, and all of them are tourists. However, when we search for it in domestic goods, we cannot get a single piece of traveling gear. Isn't this a pity? Reading the notes of Wu Danchan, a Qing dynasty person, he said that there was a Jiang Jusheng in Huangshan who called himself the Layman Woyun'an. He made traveling gear, hollowing out willow wood to make a flat stone (that is, a carrying pole, the stone sound is a pole), coated with lacquer, shiny, dark, and strong. He carried two bamboo baskets, with several layers of baskets, hanging the flat stone on both ends. What was stored inside were pocket-sized poems and rhymes, five-color Song Dynasty imitation note paper, fine inkstone, stone brush, ink, etc.; and copper tea and wine utensils, secret-color food utensils, sand pots, earthenware basins, cooking stoves, fan fire chopsticks, fire flint, lacquer rest pots, mottled bamboo chopsticks, etc., which were placed layer by layer, and outside was a wet dried gourd, palm cattail cushion hanging on the flat stone. Every time he traveled, everyone knew it was the Layman Woyun'an's items. I think these traveling gears are quite well-equipped, but it is necessary to carry them with a flat pole, acting like a porter, which seems too burdensome, and is not suitable for modern people. If we can take the best of it and modify it, then every tourist will definitely have one as a special item.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Miscellaneous Poems on the Lake <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The spring holiday of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China has been spent between the Six Bridges and the Three Temples! The spring scenery on the lake is certainly very good; but, I myself inexplicably feel that there is a kind of melancholy trace floating in my heart, alas! It cannot be blown away. It cannot be cut off. It is a cloud of sorrow! 　　 On the Shanghai-Hangzhou road, I only feel that outside the car window, more layers of curtains have been added; this is not an ordinary curtain, it is a product of the Great Nature Company, weaving the fine rain threads into sparse and dense curtains. I said sadly; "It's a bit too much to hurry to West Lake to listen to the rain." The Zhu brothers who were traveling with me, Xiaogu and Zao Wu, said in unison; "Maybe it's God adding makeup to Xizi." When we arrived in Hangzhou, it was already night. The next day, it was newly cleared, and when we looked up, we saw that the good mountains seemed to have been bathed. This night's rain was simply a makeup poem given by God. I made a quatrain;</p>
<p>The lake and mountains are newly cleared and their appearance has changed, the willows are green and the grass is fragrant; I recognized Xishi in the paintings, last night's rain was the makeup.</p>
<p>A mobile concert was opened on West Lake. Male and female students floating on the lake were playing music and singing in dragonfly-style boats; West Lake was originally charming and beautiful, but with this water music, it became even more charming and beautiful. However, in such a world, if there is a Huan Ziye who hears the song, he will just call Naibao! I made a quatrain;</p>
<p>A light boat chases the light waves, playing the flute and singing on the water; If there is a Huan Ziye from the past, he should also scratch his head and ask what to do.</p>
<p>I heard an unfortunate thing on the lake. The American Consul General, Mr. Keyinhan, brought his wife to visit the lake and mountains. His wife suddenly suffered an acute illness and died in a hospital in Hangzhou. People said it was meningitis. The Weaver Girl star sank, and of course there was sadness for the Silver River! I made a quatrain;</p>
<p>Bringing family to enjoy the spring, the joy was not yet in full bloom, suddenly the happy intestines turned into sad intestines! The Star Weaver Girl sank and mourned the Silver River, heaven and earth are both vast and vague.</p>
<p>The nickname of King Qian Wusu was Poliu. When he was born, the room was full of strange phenomena. His father wanted to abandon him, but an old woman helped him to raise him, so he was called Poliu. Later, he used three thousand iron crossbows to shoot back the tide. Although the matter is close to mythology, it makes people feel energetic when they hear it. Now the Yinghai storm is evil. Where will another Qian Poliu come to shoot back the tide? I made a quatrain;</p>
<p>Wandering under the Poliu Ancestral Hall, where is the heroic wind of the iron crossbow?</p>
<p>Today, the sea waves invade the mainland, who can solve the problem of shooting the tide?</p>

<p>— Jiang Jiayan</p>
<p>Those who have heard of and admired the Fuchun River are already numerous, and some say it is far better than West Lake. I made a spring tour this time, so I went up the river by boat for hundreds of miles, gradually getting better and better. Sometimes the mountains are close and turquoise, and the distant mountains are green. Sometimes the peach blossoms are light red and the willow branches are green. Sometimes dangerous rocks are towering halfway to the sky, and sometimes strange rocks protrude from the water surface. The changes in the twists and turns of the merchants are endless; and there are often white sails and small boats, yellow sand beaches, and rocks dotted in between. The pleasing places, even if West Lake has not been artificially destroyed (such as foreign houses and new graves, etc.), should also be jealous when they see it. Where did the Creator come from, with such wonderful hands, to create this series of hundreds of miles of continuous paintings?</p>
<p>After passing Tonglu, the water becomes deep, and the original wheel reaches Qilong, that is, Dengjunyutai and Xie Gaoyuting. Although the two pavilions are not very high, the view is very good. Overlooking the riverside, the boats are as small as fish. I don't know what strange technique Yan Ziling relied on to catch real fish. I am afraid the fisherman's intention was not in the fish? Huang Weng, an old customs official, was traveling with me, and he was a veteran who knew the way. On the way back, the staff of the Nepal Travel Agency turned into Egret Stream. Walking for miles after going ashore, suddenly the stream water gurgled, impacting the beach stones and making rapids, and then seeing the stones high and low, forming long and short three waterfalls. The water is碧 green, flowing over light yellow stone eggs, asking for snow-white waves. The color matching is so good that painters cannot dream of it. And the near mountains actually rise from the water's edge, and the mountains surround them on the left and right. Those who were in the boat trip paintings are now walking in seven poems. Then we arrived at a place where two waters flowed east and west, converging into the former stream, forming the shape of淼characters. Bamboo and wood undulated between the three waters. The stream water was not deep and we could take off our shoes and wade through it, but the flow was rapid. One or two wooden rafts rushed straight through. The beach stones were full of the stream. When the water was dry, it could be used for resting and sitting. When the water was submerged in the water, the water was clear to the bottom, and the fish and shrimps were all visible. Unfortunately, due to the time constraints, I dared not stay for a long time, and I did not have time to enter the Egret Temple. When I arrived in Hangzhou, it was already an hour past the original scheduled time. I hope that the travel agency will add the Egret Stream to the Fuchun River tour route in the future, and I also hope that those who travel to Hangzhou will not forget to take a tour of this beautiful Chunjiang.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Three Tours of Lingyan <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>Lingyan is thirty miles southwest of Suzhou. Its height is only five times that of Tiger Hill, and it has the glory of Qianlong, with a brick-paved imperial road that is very flat, so it takes no effort to go up and down. Even those who are not in good health can barely climb it. I have visited Lingyan three times so far. The first time, I was still studying at Caoqiao Middle School. I mustered up my courage and walked from Suzhou to Lingyan. I even encountered rain on the way. Although the desire to travel was good, the trip was very embarrassing. But even now, I think about it and feel that my childhood is gone, and my childlike innocence has been lost. I can't do it again. The second time was last year, when I went with the teachers and students of Soochow University Affiliated High School. After twenty-two years, the mountains and rivers are the same, but the scenery is very different. Originally, Lingyan Temple only had a few thatched houses, but now it is surrounded by pink walls, with winding corridors, and it is still working hard to build towering buildings. The two huge hexagonal and octagonal wells are also being dredged and excavated. It is said that it is all the power of the former abbot to raise money. The former abbot once participated in Xia Chaojun's curtain, so he raised a lot of money from the wealthy ladies. At that time, I was surprised by his boundless Buddhism. This time is the third time I have visited Lingyan. In addition to my family, there are also relatives, a total of eleven people, both large and small, male and female, so the fun is very good. It is a pity that the time was calculated too economically. When I arrived at Xumen at 8:10, the boat was too crowded for tourists and had already left early, so I had to send it off with my eyes very boringly for two hours. I took advantage of the second steamship to go, but the time was too tight to visit at leisure. The new buildings of Lingyan Temple have been largely completed. Although they have not been painted, there are several places where you can sit and talk. There is a train that transports stone foundations and stone steps up the mountain. According to the workers, it can only be transported once from dawn to dusk, which shows how much effort it takes. Mr. Fushiren said. There are also people picking up lime, bricks, tiles, and river sand. They are also hired by mountain farmers, who are paid two cents per pound. So the life of mountain farmers is best to carry sedan chairs, but unfortunately there are only spring and autumn seasons, when there are more tourists, there will be customers. I said, the women at the foot of the mountain are really admirable. They farm when they are busy. They embroider when they are idle. They carry sedan chairs when they are busy and idle. They are talented in both civil and military affairs and can do both rough and fine work. May I ask which country's women in the world have this ability? The walls of the temple are full of maxims, many of which are not Buddhist sayings, because the current abbot is a high-ranking disciple of Master Yinguang and advocates the new monk movement. Even Fayun Temple near Baitaqiao is writing "Great Unity Doctrine, only Buddhism. The way to hygiene, vegetarian food is the most suitable." on the yellow walls, which is probably also influenced by him. Buddhism should be so widespread, then Buddhism will be even more boundless.</p>
<p>The stone of Lingyan Mountain is as simple as Tianping. Originally, there was a famous "Turtle Looking at the Great Lake", but now it is carved with the three characters "Looking at the Buddha", which can turn vulgarity into elegance. If people who like to do things propose more names and add more comments, it can also make the famous mountain more beautiful. There are very few trees on the mountain. Although they have been planted recently, they are still young. It is best to plant more plum blossoms, peach blossoms, and the like. The spring color will be even more gorgeous.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Chinese Qingming and Foreign Qingming met happily. The ships were connected, and the beautiful spring was dancing. After sweeping the tombs, they climbed the mountains to visit. No wonder the mountains were unusually lively. The Shijia Hotel was always full of customers, and I sold tens of millions of sesame cakes. So the scenic line and the life line are interconnected.</p>
<p>There are two steamships from Suzhou to Mudu in the morning, and they can all come back in time, even if you take a rickshaw. If an automobile road is built in the future, it will of course be even more convenient.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Special Symptoms and Treatment Methods of Neutrodyne Radios <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Neutrodyne radios often have a special strange symptom, that is, in a section with a higher frequency, the radio reception is very good, but the sound of receiving radio stations with a lower frequency is very weak, and sometimes it cannot be received at all. This strange phenomenon may be a problem that service radio workers often encounter and think about most. The main cause of this difficulty usually has the following two types:</p>
<p>(1) The capacitance of the padding capacitor does not match the frequency of the intermediate amplifier of the Neutrodyne radio. The frequency is the difference between the oscillation frequency of the oscillation stage and the frequency of the external signal. For example, if the frequency of the intermediate amplifier stage is I75KC, the oscillation circuit must always be I75KC higher than the high frequency amplifier circuit.</p>
<p>For all adjustment circuits, the frequency that can be tuned depends entirely on the product of the inductance and capacitance of the coil, which is simply represented by LC. The basic formula for calculating the frequency is F=2NLC=I. If you examine the formula carefully, you can see that the product of LC is inversely proportional to the square of the frequency. If you double the frequency, LC must be reduced to a quarter of the original value. If you triple the frequency, LC must be reduced to one-ninth of the original value. For example, if the frequency is 500KC (that is, a wavelength of 600 meters), the required LC product is ·I, then the LC of I000KC should be ·025, which is a quarter of the original number. The LC of I500KC should be ·0III, which is one-ninth of the original value. The frequency range of broadcast radios is from I500KC to 500KC. The highest frequency is three times the lowest, so the maximum capacitance of the adjustment capacitor in the high-frequency stage must be nine times the minimum capacitance to be applicable.</p>
<p>The frequency of the oscillation stage should be I75KC higher, and its frequency range should be I675KC to 675KC. The ratio of the highest to the lowest is two and a half times, so the maximum capacitance of the adjustment capacitor needs to be equal to 21/2 squared (that is, 6I/4) times its minimum capacitance. However, the adjustment capacitors of the high-frequency stage and the oscillation stage of ordinary radios are coaxial, so a capacitor must be connected in series in the oscillation stage to reduce the total capacitance, so that the maximum is 6I/4 times the minimum. This capacitor connected in series is called a padding capacitor. The figure shows the simple adjustment circuit of the high-frequency stage and the oscillation stage of the Neutrodyne radio. C is the padding capacitor, and the capacitance is as indicated in the figure. If the reader thinks about it a little, he should be able to understand its calculation method. If the capacitance of this capacitor does not match, then even if it is calibrated to I675KC when the capacitance is the smallest, it will be far from the predetermined I675KC when it is turned to the largest capacitance, so that the radio cannot receive sensitively. Therefore, the first treatment method for this symptom is to calibrate the capacitance of the padding capacitor.</p>
<p>(2) The oscillation tube stops oscillating. Sometimes the oscillation stage of the Neutrodyne radio can oscillate in the section with a higher frequency (shorter wavelength), but when it is rotated to a lower frequency (longer wavelength), the vacuum tube stops oscillating, so that no radio stations can be heard in that section. This situation is also the most common cause of illness. The reason why the vacuum tube cannot oscillate is probably due to (1) the screen voltage is too low, (2) the curtain grid voltage is too low, (3) the vacuum tube is old and has lost its original efficiency, (4) insufficient feedback energy, etc. Treatment methods: First measure the voltage of the screen electrode and the curtain grid electrode. If it is too low, pay attention to whether the resistance in the screen circuit and the curtain grid circuit is damaged or changed in value, and whether the capacitor has leakage or short circuit. Then check whether the vacuum tube is intact. If there is another vacuum tube of the same number in the machine, you may exchange it for a test, and there will often be unexpected gains. Finally, the feedback energy of the screen circuit should be matched. Increasing the capacitance of the feedback capacitor and the coupling density of the feedback loop are extremely effective. In short, this vacuum tube must be able to obtain extremely stable oscillation within the required frequency range.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Not Having an A-Battery Radio <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Yuxian</p>
<p>Frequently charging the A-battery of a radio is a troublesome matter. Moreover, if one is not careful, the electrolyte can leak out, posing a risk of damaging clothing. The diagram below shows how to use a B-battery with voltage reduction after connecting the filaments in series. Resistor R3 is a voltage-reducing resistor of 1000 ohms. R2 is 50 ohms, and R1 has a resistance of 500 ohms. It is best to use a variable resistor, which can also adjust the volume. If using a two-volt energy-saving vacuum tube, R3 is probably enough at 1200 ohms, and the other components do not need to be changed. The other components are those commonly used in ordinary radios.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Design of Power Amplifiers (Continued) <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>As shown in the above formula (3), if RO and RP are equal, then the output P should be:</p>
<p>P = 9 X 784 X 2000 / (2000 + 2000)^2 = 0.882 watts. If RO and RP are equal, then the following formula can be obtained:</p>
<p>P(Max) = U^2 EG^2 / 4RP ·····(4)</p>
<p>P(max) is the maximum output. If the values from the previous example are substituted into formula (4), the result will be the same, that is, P(max) is the maximum output. If the numerical values from the previous example are substituted into formula (4), the result will also be the same, that is, P(max) = 9 X 784 / 4 X 2000 = 0.882 watts. However, to ensure that the power tube operates properly without distortion, the external total resistance RO must adopt an appropriately large value. If the value of RO is too low, distortion is likely to occur. Therefore, to obtain the maximum undistorted output from a power tube, the value of the ordinary external total resistance RO should be twice the value of the plate dissipation resistance RP, namely:</p>
<p>RO = 2RP</p>
<p>In this case, the maximum undistorted output is</p>
<p>P(max) = 2u^2 Eg^2 / 9Rd ··(5)</p>
<p>EG in formula (5) is the effective value, but because the value of the input AC voltage (peak voltage) must not exceed the DC bias voltage value, if this point is taken into consideration, and assuming Eg is the peak voltage, then formula (5) can be changed to the following formula:</p>
<p>P(max) = U^2 Eg^2 / 9RP ··(6)</p>
<p>Taking the 245-type vacuum tube as an example, the maximum undistorted output is calculated. According to the tube's parameters, RP = 1900, u = 3.5. Substituting these numbers into formula (6) yields the following maximum undistorted output:</p>
<p>P(max) = 3.5 X 3.5 X EG^2 / 9 X I900</p>
<p>= 0.67 Eg^2 / I000 watts = 0.67 Eg^2 kilowatts</p>
<p>The peak voltage of EG is 50 volts, i.e., P(max) = 0.67 X 0.2 = I.675 kilowatts. Now, the output of various commonly used power tubes is calculated according to the above, and a table is obtained as follows for readers to refer to when designing power amplifiers.</p>
<p>From the results of the calculation, we can know that the output power is proportional to the grid voltage Eg. For example, when using a 245-type tube, if the voltage of Eg is too low, its capability cannot be fully utilized, which is the most important thing in designing a power amplifier.</p>
<p>The second diagram shows the circuit using a 245-type tube for the final stage power amplification. To make the final stage power amplification tube V3 obtain the maximum output, Eg should be supplied with a peak voltage of 50 volts. This voltage is obtained from the secondary coil of the low-frequency transformer T2. Therefore, if T2 has a ratio of one to four, the voltage of the primary coil E3 should be</p>
<p>E3 = 50 / 4 = 12.5 volts</p>
<p>That is, a voltage of 12.5 volts is required in the plate circuit of the V2 vacuum tube, and this voltage is obtained from the following formula, namely E3 = U^2 E2</p>
<p>In the formula, E2 is the input voltage of the V2 vacuum tube, and U2 is the effective amplification factor of the V2 tube. Therefore, the input voltage E2 of the V2 tube should be</p>
<p>E2 = E3 / U = 12.5 / 6 = 2.08 volts</p>
<p>Secondly, the transformer TI has a ratio of one to three, so E3 should obtain E1 = 2.08 / 3 = 0.669 volts</p>
<p>That is, if there is a voltage of 0.669 volts in the plate circuit of the detector tube VI, the maximum power of the 245-type tube can be obtained. (End)</p>

<p>— Bingyi</p>
<p>(3) Calculation of Position: When the wire is not yet wound, use a pencil to draw the width of the iron core window on a piece of white paper. Then calculate how much thickness the primary coil needs in total (when calculating, the thickness of the insulating paper and insulating cloth should be added), how much thickness the secondary coil needs, add the paper core and insulating cloth, and the insulating cloth between the primary and secondary coils. How much is the total thickness? See if this gap is suitable to decide on the winding plan, so that there will be no problem of not being able to fit it at the end.</p>
<p>(4) The iron core should not be too thick to avoid heat generation due to eddy currents and loss of electrical energy.</p>
<p>(5) It is not advisable to use thick paper for insulation. When the position is wide, thick paper is used for insulation in the belief that it can be extra safe. However, thick paper easily stores heat, which is greatly contrary to durability. (6) Coil Taps: The more coil taps, the more important the insulation problem is. Each tap should preferably be cleverly arranged at either end of the coil. The soldering wire should be flat, and the soldered area should be varnished after soldering. Flat wires are best for lead wires so they can be equally attached when winding the lower layer. When at the high-voltage section of the coil, the lead wire must be thin, but at both ends of this high-voltage coil and the lead wires soldered to each tap, thicker wires should be used. The taps should not be pulled too tight, as there is often a danger of pulling them out of the coil.</p>
<p>(7) Pay attention to short circuits. Short circuits are often caused by a short circuit in one turn of the coil, which generates a voltage between the short circuits. This causes a large amount of current to pass through, burning out this circuit, rendering the entire thing ineffective.</p>
<p>(8) Add Wax to the Coil: After the coil is wound, soak it in wax. Do not use gelatinous substances such as rosin resin, because when the enameled wire encounters these things, the wrapping paint will easily dissolve, and because they are prone to moisture, the coil will not dry.</p>
<p>(9) Tighten the Iron Core: After the iron sheets are inserted into the coil, they should be tightened with iron clips to prevent the iron sheets from vibrating and causing AC noise. It is best to paint them firmly with asphalt or magnetic paint.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Rogers' Mission to China <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>Not long ago, after the United States announced Roosevelt's policy of raising the price of silver, it aroused great attention from all levels of society in our country. Some people advocated banning the export of silver in case of emergency, while others advocated levying a silver tax, taking the method of prohibition through taxation. However, these are all stopgap measures!</p>
<p>Recently, in order to thoroughly understand the impact of raising the price of silver and purchasing power in the Far East, Rogers specially sent Professor Rogers and silver expert Mr. Burton to China for an on-the-spot investigation. The group arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 9th and stated that they needed to inspect Nanjing, Tianjin, and other places. They will stay in China for about a month. However, according to our speculation, Rogers' sending Rogers to China for investigation this time actually bears two major missions; here, our countrymen, must pay attention to it.</p>
<p>(1) Since Rogers promoted the Blue Eagle Movement, the financial structure of the US authorities has become increasingly shaken. The surge of labor unrest cannot be restrained. One wave after another has continued to expand and spread in various places. Six or seven thousand unemployed workers marched in teams, disturbing the government, and shouting "We need bread and work." The brewing of this labor unrest has developed uncontrollably, so Rogers' Blue Eagle Movement has suffered a major blow, and its fundamental plan has also lost its effectiveness. In order to cope with the current difficult environment, he had to raise the price of silver in order to dump their surplus products in the Far Eastern market, on the one hand to relieve the livelihood of unemployed workers, and on the other hand to reverse the decline of domestic industry and commerce. However, in order to facilitate dumping and encourage the purchasing power of our people, Rogers was sent to China to investigate the commercial situation in various parts of our country and the impact of raising the price of silver.</p>
<p>(2) Rogers also wants to implement his unique authoritarianism to adapt to the current international crisis. Therefore, he ordered Rogers to come to the Far East to investigate the situation of various countries and the current situation of the localities, make an accurate perspective, and be prepared, so that his country can be confident and fearless, so as to handle his entire policy; the depth of his intention is admirable!</p>
<p>From this speculation, the reason why Rogers came to China to investigate, not hesitating to travel far, is not difficult to trace according to the map. Because his coming to China is not only to investigate the silver problem, but also has other important tasks. It is said that the banking industry is also afraid of external suspicion, so it did not go to meet Rogers upon his arrival in Shanghai. However, even though it is like this now, it may not prevent people from generating doubts in the future. In short, they should still check and be cautious in fact, then the outside world's misunderstanding will not be worth fearing. According to reports; when reporters from this city asked Rogers for various opinions, the answers were all elusive, which could not help but arouse suspicion. However, we finally unexpectedly heard a beautiful praise; "I think China is a very promising country"! It is really an honor, which makes us feel "It is impolite to refuse it" and "Ashamed to accept it"! Our China is still seen by Rogers as hopeful, even extremely hopeful! It cannot help but make people feel "A child can be taught"!</p>
<h3 id="e213">Law and Human Sentiment - Watching the Fugitive <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>Human society is gradually evolving, and divine teachings can no longer cope with the progress of this society. In order to protect the peace of human beings in society, laws were produced. It governs all human beings in society with supreme and unlimited power, but the law is a dead trap. It makes a wooden shackle and forces living human beings to drill into the empty space of the wooden shackle, so the law can only make positive judgments, but cannot see through the back side that the law cannot pay attention to. For example, let's say that a car ran over a pedestrian, and naturally this car has to be subject to a certain kind of judgment in terms of law. The law must say that the murderer pays for his life (I don't understand the law, and I haven't had a clear relationship with the law. I think that the murderer pays for his life. There must be such a clause in the law.) But the law cannot make a human judgment on the situation at the time of the event. This dead wooden shackle locks up a living chauffeur. It is not necessarily the chauffeur's fault that the chauffeur ran over the pedestrian. In his driving profession, he must also often want to avoid such unfortunate events. He would never intentionally run the car into a pedestrian, however, I did not say that the pedestrians who were run over by cars all went to seek death on their own. In short, within the scope of the law, a small thing is sometimes a contradiction that the law absolutely did not expect. But the law is supreme, it wants to exercise its authority, and there are countless facts that are absolutely contrary to it.</p>
<p>Alan in The Fugitive wanted to seek the grand plan of developing his engineering, but finally became impoverished and destitute, and was forced by hooligans to become a thief. He had no premeditation. In the event at that time, he was in the same position as the shopkeeper. He was forced to be a robber who killed and stole goods once. Whether Alan was willing or whether he joined the gang of thieves because of this is not told to us in the picture. However, the law sentenced him to ten years of hard labor with a dead wooden shackle.</p>
<p>After he escaped from prison, changed his name and surname, and engaged in his beloved engineering career, it can be seen that Alan is not a bad guy who is willing to be a thief. However, the law knows that he is a fugitive thief, and he was sent into the dead wooden shackle again. We can make a human discussion about the former and the latter. He was forced to become a thief, just as the chauffeur who ran over a pedestrian sometimes really had no choice. The law cannot see the back side. Secondly, it seems that the law does not allow a criminal to repent. Once you become a robber, there is never a chance to turn over. Alan's second prison break can only be "I'm leaving" and he will end his life as a fugitive.</p>
<p>As for the exposure of the darkness of American prisons, which are called civilized by the world, in this film, the film review has described it in detail. Almost every picture grabs the soul of the audience. No wonder the authorities in the concession banned it. So I also want to talk about whether a person who has committed a crime should be beaten, insulted, and forced to perform hard labor like cattle and horses?</p>

<p>— Danxin</p>
<p>In that Yue Lao Temple, there are many young men in suits and fashionable girls; these seem to be middle school and college students from Shanghai. One by one, they kowtowed to Yue Lao, shook the lottery tube, and scrambled to draw lots. After drawing a lot, they spent four copper coins to buy a lottery slip from the incense vendor. After reading the lottery slip, they all left happily and joyfully. "Then, isn't smoking harmful to the lungs?"</p>
<p>"But isn't it much better than wandering the streets and starving?"</p>
<p>"Can't I do other things well?"</p>
<p>"I can't get any jobs anyway. There is overproduction in society, and layoffs are not keeping up. Plus, I don't know how many reserve armies of industry have run out of bankrupt rural areas. By the time I have a job to do, society should have been stained with a layer of hot blood." When speaking excitedly, he almost knocked over the ink bottle on the table.</p>
<p>But our Old Li's brain is not like a machine, which will produce a lot of Inspiration when smoking. At that time, he walked out of the small room and paced towards the gathering place of so-called lower-class people, saying that he was looking for materials among the lower classes.</p>
<p>The life of投稿 with breakfast but no dinner lasted for a year, but the physique of a twenty-year-old youth became almost a middle-aged man around thirty years old.</p>
<p>I haven't seen our Old Li for more than a month. Suddenly, this morning, I received a letter from his hometown. He was sick. He had been sick in Shanghai for a week. Because he had no money for medical treatment, he had to lie hard on the bed. But later, he really had no choice but to call a friend to accompany him back to his hometown. He said: My friends, don't move forward in literature anymore. That is a cruel dead end of hunger and ice!</p>
<p>Listening to the sound of spring rain dripping outside the window, looking at Old Li's letter full of blood and tears, I couldn't help but sigh; "Alas, Old Li has failed!"</p>

<p>— Wangwo</p>
<p>In Japan, which is in a state of emergency, the cover of every magazine is marked with "How should we prepare for the state of emergency?" Every head, young and old, is shaking with the seriousness of 1936. How should we prepare!</p>
<p>Tokyo, after the great earthquake, has been rebuilt, brand new. In particular, primary education is especially valued. Just the construction and internal facilities of primary school buildings alone cost millions! The reason is very simple: every child must recognize the greatness of national power!</p>
<p>Let's talk about some of Japan's clothing, food, housing, and transportation.</p>
<p>Ordinary people wear kimonos made of original-width cloth, which do not need to be cut, and are easy to be changed for other uses when they are not suitable. Students all have bald heads and wear light student uniforms. Teachers and other higher-class people all wear suits, which is probably the trend after the Restoration.</p>
<p>Japanese restaurants have Japanese, Chinese, and Western cuisine, but the latter two have been Japanized, only using the cooking methods and forms. In addition to liking cold food, every meal is suitable for nutritional nourishment, and there are also fruits to help digestion. Speaking of their physique, it is really different from the past! Schools attach great importance to physical education, hygiene, and labor, with complete facilities, as well as various trips, mountain climbing, and summer facilities at the beach, all of which are implemented practically. If it doesn't take long, they will call us Chinese dwarfs, right?</p>

<h3 id="e216">May I Be Reborn as a Daughter <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Non</p>
<p>Not long ago, after reading Mr. Qun Ping's article "Wishing to Be Reborn as a Son in the Next Life" in this publication, I couldn't help but feel a sense of aversion. Thus, I want to unleash the pent-up emotions that have been brewing within me for years, a large amount of words that I've long wanted to express but haven't been able to.</p>
<p>The thing is, I harbor a contradictory psychology towards all kinds of women; jealousy, admiration; but I don't know if it's more jealousy or more admiration, which even I find inexplicable!</p>
<p>However, I still think being a woman is good. No matter what aspect, they always have more advantages compared to men. In law, in social interactions, in life, they can more easily gain advantages over men. "Those who did not cultivate good karma in their past lives are reborn as men in this life to suffer!" In times of boredom, I often lament myself this way; if I were a woman, a modern, fashionable woman. Then, no matter what, I wouldn't have to suffer as much as I do now. "Thus, the hearts of parents throughout the land favor the birth of daughters over sons!" Bai Letian said so in "The Song of Everlasting Regret," and the present era has confirmed it for him in an undeniable way. So, while they may be slightly inferior in name, they are far superior in material enjoyment and financial provision. If you don't believe me, feel free to listen to what I have to say; if you are willing to go to the market and investigate, then you will easily find the following examples: fragrant, beautiful, sweet-smelling, delicate, graceful, charming, gorgeous, sensual – all the sweet and enchanting adjectives are monopolized by them, leaving us stinky men to only salivate with desire. Just looking at these aspects is enough for you to be jealous and envious. But men are different, full of stench, sweat, foul breath, a stench that fills the air, making people disgusted! I think the literati of the past were truly hateful; why did they describe women as so lovely and despise men as worthless? What was their intention?</p>
<p>Let's talk about enjoyment! Then, there will naturally be many men, with whiskers and eyebrows, who do their best to serve them, willing to be beasts of burden, not daring to disobey the Jade Emperor's decree, "They can shake the heavens and earth, but they dare not offend the Jade Emperor." That's right, absolutely correct. Although some people say that Chinese women were oppressed by men in the past, oppressed for over four thousand years without a chance to turn over. However, I believe that not only was it like this in the past, but how much different is it now? Every day, they dress up in flamboyant attire, willing to offer their entire bodies, smiles, and nakedness for men to play with and appreciate! For them, it is instinctive to enjoy the rewards, materials, and sexual desires that they exchange for their bodies and smiles, spending extravagantly and consuming limitlessly. On the other hand, men suddenly have an increased burden of pressure; of course, the instability and economic downturn of the current society are at least partly their responsibility. The country has been brought to this state, and it is not unrelated to them. In general, female students and modern ladies are willing to marry important figures as concubines – why is this? Two young men, for the sake of loving the same woman, are willing to sacrifice, becoming irreconcilable, even disregarding injury to their lives and ruin to their careers! The Tang Emperor, for the sake of Yang Yuhuan, disregarded his vast empire, "Loving beauty more than the country"! I ask, which is more important, "country" or "beauty"? All these things are nothing but for the sake of a woman, "Alas, how many people are lost in the inch of land in their hearts!" What exactly is a woman worth? To cause such a scramble for her! So, some people say that if there were no women and money in the world, there would truly be days of peace, times of tranquility. Otherwise, it's all just self-inflicted trouble, with no meaning! Women are a source of trouble, alas! I don't want to say more.</p>
<p>Now women have been elevated almost beyond the thirty-third heaven. In the near future, I'm afraid we men's rice bowls will be smashed to pieces by them, alas! Men are in danger!</p>
<p>But I have to say it again. Ultimately, these things are the sons' own fault, perhaps self-inflicted, so of course, we cannot solely blame women. However, it is undeniable that women are happier than men, so I want to "be reborn as a daughter in the next life" and I have my reasons…</p>

<h3 id="e217">I Can't Justify It to My Own Conscience <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I have a friend, Mr. Jiang, who has a difficult problem to solve, causing him great mental distress. For the sake of friendship, I want to alleviate his suffering, but I myself cannot solve this problem for him. Because I know you are a guide to society, I am specifically asking you to guide him!</p>
<p>The facts are like this: My friend, Mr. Jiang, is currently studying at a certain university. Recently, he became engaged to Miss B. Before he was engaged, he was once loved by Miss A, but Miss A is an illiterate country girl, and she had previously been engaged to another man by the orders of her parents and the words of a matchmaker. This engagement has now been dissolved (it is said that the other party was incompetent and did not fulfill the engagement, and Miss A's parents did not want him, so both parties voluntarily dissolved the engagement). As for Miss B! She is a complete middle school student. This time, my friend became engaged to her due to the introduction of someone and the agreement of both parties, and with the permission of their parents. My friend previously only had affection for Miss A and no love for her; it was simply that the falling flower had intentions, and the flowing water was indifferent, so this time he became engaged to Miss B. Who knew that Miss A would suddenly express to my friend at this time; with an attitude of "I will not marry anyone but you," and if she cannot get her wish, she will only commit suicide to repay my friend. My friend saw her such deep affection and righteousness, and his whole heart was occupied by her; but Miss B's feelings for him are also not bad, and he has already carried out the engagement. Therefore, my friend is in a dilemma. To serve Qi or to serve Chu? He is unable to cope.</p>
<p>If he chooses Miss B and abandons Miss A, then if Miss A commits suicide, my friend will not only be unable to face her, but he will also not be able to justify it to his own conscience. If he chooses Miss A and abandons Miss B, it is also not easy, because now both parties have willingly engaged, and Miss B is an intellectual, moreover, their feelings for each other are also not bad. If he accepts both, then not only will it not be allowed by Miss B (Miss B certainly does not know about Miss A, but Miss A knows about the engagement with Miss B), but it will also not be tolerated by society. So, what should he do? Please advise in your publication in the near future! With best wishes for your writing, Zhang Xiaochang</p>
<p>Answer: Your friend's kind of problem cannot be solved by outsiders. Because an outsider's answer only stands on the position of reason, while matters such as "love" and "marriage" are mostly manipulated by the feelings of those involved. Therefore, the method that others come up with, even if it is said eloquently, will still seem to the person who wants to apply it to reality that the method drafted by others is unrealistic and cannot appreciate their suffering. What's more, this is a problem of a love triangle, which is most likely to make people fall into depression, and the deadlock with no solution naturally makes the words of others even more useless. However, since you have sincerely inquired, the editor is also very willing to discuss this issue, just for your friend's reference.</p>
<p>The reason why love triangles are difficult to solve is that the one being loved loves both of the two parties who love him, wanting both, but one cannot have both, so "choice" becomes a big problem. If both parties have the determination of "no one but him," there is even less way. "Choosing" is also very simple to say: marrying A means not marrying B, marrying B means not marrying A, extremely simple, what's so difficult? However, it is difficult to make a choice that "is worthy of others and unworthy of oneself." But this is not really impossible, but three principles should be paid attention to: (1) Take his own (for example, your friend) future happiness or career development as the premise, that is, compare the two people to see which one is suitable for him as a spouse; (2) Compare the situation of the two parties. If it is more difficult for one party to marry someone else, then even if your love for her is worse, you cannot be too selfish; (3) Consider the responsibility that you should bear to the other party, such as if you do not marry her, it has the nature of deception. If the above three conditions conflict with each other, then the third and second should be used as the standard. In conclusion, love and marriage should of course be based on one's own opinion, but if one has previously expressed to someone or accepted "love," then one has to take responsibility and cannot completely start from self-interest, let alone change one's mind easily and talk about love with others at will.</p>
<p>Your friend's situation, according to the above conditions, should have two judgments: that is, if your friend has never really expressed love to Miss A before, then even if Miss A threatens to die, he can ignore it; because according to the theory of love, your friend does not need to bear any responsibility, so there is no place to be sorry for her, and her suicide is either too infatuated or too arrogant. However, according to the editor's guess, even if your friend did not have the heart to love Miss A before, I am afraid that he only had a little expression of love in form (at least Miss A meant this), so now if he wants to abandon her, he cannot help but feel a little guilty! Moreover, in fact, A is a country girl, and B is a "complete middle school student," then it is easier to choose the latter for marriage. Therefore, according to the editor's opinion, even though your friend has an engagement with Miss B, he should still not fulfill the engagement and marry Miss A. Of course, this is sorry for B, but between two evils, take the lesser one. It is undoubtedly less harmful to take A and abandon B than to take B and abandon A. Editor</p>

<p>— Manzhi</p>
<p>Pu Ning answered, "Yes, the eldest young master has returned."</p>
<p>"Returned! Returned!" Sixth Master said as if he was going crazy, clenching his fists and walking back and forth in the study. Pu Ning was still standing there, not daring to move. His eyes followed Sixth Master's body as he turned around in the room. Sixth Master suddenly stopped in front of the window, his eyes looking at the green banana trees outside, beaten by the rain. He stood for a while and then turned back to walk. After walking for a while, he stopped in front of the desk under the window, suddenly hitting the desk with his fist and shouting loudly,</p>
<p>"Kill himself!"</p>
<p>Master said again,</p>
<p>"Beat him to death!"</p>
<p>Saying this, he turned back to walk. Pu Ning thought in his heart, "Sixth Master is mad with anger! The eldest young master is really an unfilial son. If he hadn't followed others in making trouble back then, Sixth Master wouldn't dislike him so much! People with fields and land at home also followed others in making trouble, really deserve to be beaten."</p>
<p>Sixth Master walked to the center of the room, suddenly stopped again, and said to Pu Ning,</p>
<p>"Don't leak the news, understand?"</p>
<p>Pu Ning replied, "I know, Sixth Master."</p>
<p>Sixth Master instructed him again, "Tell Madam and Young Mistress not to let him leave today. I'll come over from Second Master's side."</p>
<p>Pu Ning answered, "Yes," and went out. Sixth Master took a paper umbrella and went out. Second Master's study was not far away. Sixth Master hurried through the rain, turning corners and arriving. At the door, he heard Sixth Master's eldest young master, Lian Sun, loudly saying, "As long as there's money to be made, who cares whether it's Japan or not? Patriotic enthusiasm is all deceiving people!" He also heard the eldest young master of the Third House, Gui Sun, loudly saying, "They are really cold-blooded animals! The Northeast provinces can be lost, and the entire China can be lost. They only care about making money and don't care about the fall of the country. What's the benefit of being a slave to a fallen country?" He also heard Lian Sun say, "Cold-blooded animal or slave to a fallen country, I don't care what people scold me!" Sixth Master covered the paper umbrella and walked through the corridor to the door of the study, coughed, and then went in. Lian Sun and Gui Sun stopped arguing and stood up from their chairs to greet him, calling out,</p>
<p>"Sixth Uncle, please sit down!"</p>
<p>Lian Sun was already over thirty years old, with a round face and a big mouth, looking very much like his grandfather, but he hadn't grown a beard yet. Gui Sun was also around thirty, but he looked like a monkey. Sixth Master usually praised these two nephews highly. Both are capable, one runs a cloth shop in Shantou, and the other runs a sugar warehouse in the city. After Sixth Master sat down, he first asked his nephew Lian Sun, "When did you return home from Shantou?" Lian Sun replied, "Today." He also asked his nephew Gui Sun, "Have you imported any sugar these days?" Gui Sun replied, "We can't import any more. The sugar companies in Shantou bought Japanese sugar in Hong Kong, converted it into sugar water, put it in iron boxes and falsely reported it as Hong Kong sugar water imports, and then sold it after processing. It's especially cheap, and all kinds of sugar have been hit hard, falling by several yuan. It looks like it will fall even more." Sixth Master understood the reason for their argument just now. Unwilling to listen to their argument any longer, he didn't ask any further questions and turned to ask Lian Sun, "Where did your father go?" Lian Sun replied, "He went to the back. He'll be here soon. Sixth Uncle is smoking opium in the cigarette shop."</p>
