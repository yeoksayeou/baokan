<p>我國近數十年來。廉恥道喪之舉。層出不窮。而官塲齷齪尤。爲小民所疾首。顧小民刦於一時淫威。往往忍氣呑聲。而莫敢與抗官邪倡披。導民於亂其弊在於害民之官多。治官之官少。近因時世之推移。頗有每况愈下嘆。誠可痛也。</p>
<p>說者每以淸季吏治黑暗爲言。乃不知淸代治官之官尙能盡其職守當時在科道制盛行下。猶有所謂都察院者。以整綱飭紀爲職志。舉凡政事得失官方邪正。有關於國計民生之重大利害者。皆得率直糾彈。無所顧忌其屬下之十五道監察御史。分别稽察京畿及十四重要省區之刑民事宜。御史各有彈劾之權。其彈劾範圍。就事言。自官吏殉私違法至於敗德遺行皆所網羅就人</p>
<p>言。自普通官吏至於王公貝勒大巨。罔居例外。所謂科道制之本身價値固不容抹殺也。</p>
<p>今日之監察。卽導源於曩昔之御史製度。國府監察院自民國二十年正式成立迄今。未嘗不以發伏摘奸糾彈違失爲已任而派員調查各省釐捐災賑堤工諸舉。尤得民心。顧自鼎革以還。監察權之獨立行施事屬草創或則因懲戒機關之不能集中。或則因監察職權之猶待擴充。辦事行政。動生阻礙則亦無庸爲諱。差可喜者。監委諸君。雅不欲故步自封。其改進之計劃中。有設置各區監察使一事。尤堪注意。此舉目的。蓋在使人民有就近控訴貪汚之機會。政府有洞悉民膜之鑑衡。是爲當務之急。可不待言。自本年四月初行政院通過特派。大員巡視地方規則以來。監院各委。以與監察使之職權相衝突。乃有從速組織各省監察使署先由蘇冀二省創辦之决議。此事旣爲該院組織法所許。一待經費之籌措有着。自可迅告成立。</p>
<p>據監察院監察區分區計劃之說明。全國分爲十四區。每區特派監察使。分赴各區行使彈劾職權。其意蓋略仿淸代十五道監察御史之舊制。所不同者。淸代監察御史。常川駐京。僅巡鹽巡漕巡倉等各差在外。將今之分區計劃。比擬古制。其最近似者。厥爲唐代之「十道分巡」制度。該制利益。如當時所言。蓋在使巡察人員「親至屬縣。或入閭里。督察姦訛。觀采風俗」也。今日民間疾苦。實倍蓰於唐代。以我國幅圓之廣大。民情之隔膜。及地方積弊之深厚。設立分區監察使署。以補救監委巡迴視察之不足。寗不爲吾人所贊同。然猶不能無慮者。則有監察使之權力範圍問題。監察使之人選問題。及對地方軍人之懲戒問題等三者在。</p>
<p>（一）監察院組織法第三條。「監察使分赴各監察區行使彈劾職權。」是其權力範圍。祗限彈劾一項無疑。以視淸代科道兼有建議政事。監督行政。考察官吏。會讞重案。檢查會計。註銷案卷。等權者。不可同日而語。今欲擴充各監察使之權力。當先擴充整個監察院之權力。前者監察院發表對於憲法草案初稿之意見。於此業已有所陳述。吾人亦表同情。特憲稿能否採納其意。則無從逆料。卽採納矣。又不知實行之期。在何年月。是則補苴罅漏。厥在監委諸君努力建議。中樞當局之樂予核准而已。不然。有彈劾權而無監察行政。考察官吏諸權。而懲戒機關。又依然不歸統一集中。則彈劾制度。實等於虚設。各區監察使縱有精明强幹其人。而無權以貫澈其彈劾初衷。則亦終心廢然而返而已。</p>
<p>揆諸設立監察署之原意。不其相剌謬乎。</p>
<p>（二）我國歷代御史之選任。大槪係重經騐才能。而新進之士。則摒而不用。蓋新進者。多以糾彈邀聲譽。甚至誣裁賢良。故事吹求。引用私人。作爲爪牙。積日　稍久。朋黨之弊且　緣而生。治官之官。尙不足以言自治。又轉而加速一般吏治之惡化。是亦不可以已乎。監察院組織法規定監察使得由監察委員兼任然並未謂非監委卽不得爲監察使。將來派充監察使之人選將何所依據誠不能不愼之又愼。惟能參照古制。則流弊差减耳（三）國人困頓於軍事者久矣。內地小民。受軍事長官之壓迫。更多無所告訴之苦。現制。彈劾與懲戒之權。旣已分裂。而軍事長官之交付懲戒者。復由中央最高軍事機關操其審議之權。將來監察使設立後。遇有此種彈劾案件。固無論輾轉詳申。曠日費時。結果未盡可期。卽各區監察使能否倖免當地軍事勢力之箝制。而自由發揮其彈劾之職權。亦爲絕大疑問。夫小民向監署訴冤。原爲伸雪計耳。若冒險投告於不能保護之人。以速其禍。則何如自甘静默之爲愈。監委諸君明知此路不通而爲之。毅力誠可佩。其如不能貫澈何。此爲今後監察使制度成敗利鈍之主要關鍵。誠不可以忽視之也。</p>

<h3>日謀改善對美關係美當局未置可否齋藤返國前一再試探美望提具體可行辦法</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　美聯社今日得悉、日本近曾向美國官塲試探對於日本建議改善日美關係之意見、星期二離美返國之日本駐美大使齋藤將乘此消夏時期與日政府當局商議促進日美友好關係之計畫、齋藤已與羅斯福總統及國務總理赫爾數度會議上月間羅斯福總統及赫爾總理曾接見齋藤數次、齋藤試探羅斯福總統及赫爾總理對於日本建議之反響、日本之建議如下、（一）締結日美不侵略公約、（二）根據商業諒解、發表彼此交好及不競爭宣言、（三）開始交涉「滿洲國」之地位、斐律濱之獨立、足以妨碍日美邦交之對華關係及其他問題、茲悉齋藤以爲日美間之政治問題如能圓滿解决、則海軍競爭危機自能迎刃而解、惟據美聯社所悉美國政府當局除聆此試探計畫外、並未表示可否、亦未提出對案、另據可靠方面消息、美政府當局以爲日本必須提出具體而可實行之主張、美國始能予以認眞考慮、更悉日本對華盛頓提出任何建議、亦必須爲遠東方面關係各國所能滿意接受云、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>海軍延會呼聲</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　美國海軍聯歡社前社長哈巴斯今日告美聯社記者、力主一九三五年之海軍軍縮會議無期休會、哈巴斯稱、海軍會議非僅無實際成就、反有危害世界和平及實際軍縮之可能、現在之政治及經濟狀况均不利於召集一九三五年之海軍會議、除美國外、世界海軍國對其海軍力有增無减、爲世界和平及未來之海軍軍縮會議計、現在倫敦進行之初步談話、希望能發展一種局勢、致使各國能贊成暫停一九三五年之海軍會議、以待適當時機、但各國須維持華盛頓及倫敦條約所規定之現狀、哈巴斯談至此、遂提出種種理由證明倫敦談話决無何等成就、例如日本要求海軍平等、英國要求增造巡艦二十二艘、及法意兩國建造戰艦及戰鬥巡洋艦實爲影響實際軍縮之三大原因、哈巴斯復喚起世人注意法意兩國要求俄德參加海軍會議之主張、哈巴斯稱、此舉將愈增困難云、哈巴斯主持海軍聯歡社甚久、該社甚有勢力、哈氏且被視爲海軍問題之權威、故哈氏此次表示或將引起各國之深切注意、海軍延會之說、上星期卽已聞之外交家已考慮此事矣、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>日海軍部見解</h3>
<p>（東京）　英國海相孟塞耳之海軍擴大演說、日海軍當局現不願發表正式意見加以批評、然據海軍某專門家之見解、英海相之演說可以證明歐洲一般軍縮交涉不能圓滿結束、及英美間意見不合以致英國受脅威之事　英美兩國對於海軍力意見之衝突、因於美國建造一萬噸巡洋艦時、英國非正式要求縮小艦、然美國政府拒絕其要求、爾來英國擴大軍備之熱度、日愈增加、將本年度原定建艦計劃六千噸巡洋艦四艘、改爲九千噸三艘、五千噸一艘、又英國小艦多數主義與美國大艦小數主義之根本的不同、亦係英美爭執之一原因也、又觀大陸方面法國去年起工建造一萬六千五百噸之快速力戰艦、在於其他潛水艦、空軍等實力亦頗優勢、意大利三萬五千噸之造艦計劃着着進行中英海相鑒於如此列强軍備之擴大故有今次演說亦未可知其對於海軍預備交涉之影響如何最堪注目、（二十五日日聯電）</p>
<h3>日本反俄活動</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　日本朝日新聞公佈消息、則（後經其他日本報紙轉載）謂、於審訊被捕之蘇聯友社領袖時、證明蘇聯駐日大使館職員某、曾恊助日本之共產主義運動云云、伊斯維斯太報對此評論曰、「日本報紙此項最近之反蘇聯運動、目的在令蘇日帮交惡化、其爲予盾雖不加評述、亦已了如指掌、吾人之於此等揑造所以須爲論述者、僅以此項謠傳竟由性質嚴重如朝日新聞之報紙所報道、同時復得外務省官方代表之證實、</p>
<p>日本報界此項新的反蘇聯運動、舍彼等有促使日本輿論反對蘇聯大使署及蘇聯之完全有意的願望而外、實無他道足以說明之、朝日新聞曁外務省代表固熟知蘇聯之友社乃成立於一九三一年、其發起人爲日本作家秋田·文學評論家長谷·藝術家津田·及其他藝術界科學家進步人物、該社當時之存在全係合法、且公開出版「蘇聯之友」雜誌、傳報關於蘇聯建設工作之公正消息、該社社員於一九三二年成立一獨立團體、另組「日蘇文會」該會迄今仍然存在、而據朝日新聞之消息、蘇聯之友社已於一九三三年初作最後之解散矣、</p>
<p>「吾人對於該項動人聽聞之新事件尙未知其詳情、唯自業已公佈之塔斯社電報及日本報紙之聲明觀之、此等新的非難顯有公開而遠大之挑釁性質、此項新運動之作者、其發明之能力顯然並不高明至於非難前東京大使署情報部長加爾可維契、將「若干關於蘇聯之情報材料及照片」供給一力謀與蘇聯親善之合法團體之秘書一則、殊堪發噱、此等作者顯未明瞭、任何國家內任何大使署情報部之責任、自在傳佈其所代表之國家之正確消息、至於非難加氏「援助日本共產主義運動」一節、更屬予盾、吾人由「日本報」之消息得知此項「可怕」之非難其根據、乃屬如是、卽加氏曾以日金三十五圓訂購上述團所出版之雜誌十份、由此而猜測「此項金項乃用於共產活動」、</p>

<h3>申報流通圖書館讀書指導部編</h3>
<p>目錄（一）加入讀書指導部以後</p>
<p>（二）一週情報</p>
<p>（一）加入讀書指導部以後</p>
<p>這是一個讀者的來信，他告訴我們他加入本部的經過，及自學的狀况。他是很艱苦的，一步步進到相當的成功了，這種誠懇的態度，艱苦自勵的精神，是値得欽敬的，因此將他的來信摘要登載於後，以供我們同學的參攷。</p>
<p>「在這二月內我與你們通訊已有五次了，每次都承你們懇切的覆我。現在我爲了不負你們的期望起見、將我的加入經過及加入後的自學狀况報告給你們。</p>
<p>今年三月間店裏定了一份貴報，我纔有讀報的機會。當我翻到第四張末尾時，忽然看見了「讀書問答」，引起了我特别的興趣，一連讀了幾大，我對於你們解答讀者疑難異常的感到滿意，因此，又引起我也來加入通訊，及到讀到你們的覆信後，我眞歡喜萬分。不久，我正式做了你們的學生，我的私生活也就因之一變了。</p>
<p>在今日的商店裏，一個當學徒的人不用說是不許作生意以外的事的，一般的說做學徒是沒有私生活的，整個閑暇都要被剝奪盡了。我在初入店的一年，從來看過一頁書一張報，這不是說我連看一頁書的時間都沒有，爲的是老闆不高興學徒尙不忘懷學問、回想學校生活。以前我是非常絕望的。一年後，我看了受同一痛苦的人不只我一個，我們大家就商議在公事上我們努力的做去，注意，敏捷，經濟，但同時老闆不能管我們的私生活，要讓我們能讀書，娛樂。起初他自然是不贊同的，以後見我們大家一致，在店務上，又沒有些許錯過，也就不說了。這次我們參加指導部共三人，我們現在都能有自學的時間了。這是我對於當前環境的克服。</p>
<p>至於自學的方法，這完全是近二月來你們給我們的。我應多謝你們。我記得第一次通信中我開出五六十種書籍，十數種學科要求你們指導，你們却替我删去了四十本，要我野心不要太大，要切切實實地讀一本是一本，我依照你們指導在進行了，以前每天晚上練習寫字，自讀了「習字無用論」後也改讀社會科學了。二月來，我已將社會問題大綱讀完。我做了兩本筆記。現在我覺得，我應遵照社會問題大綱的各部份，更進一步的去研究。現在就决定一門一門讀去。一年內我想對社會問題的全體知識，獲得一點基礎知識。我很自信，這方法是正確。這一來，增加了我學習的勇氣不少。從前爲了環境及年齡的關係，常憂慮着不能讀盡天下書，因而不能博學，現在這種謎已是打消了　（二）一週情報</p>
<h3>一、讀者通信箋開始發售</h3>
<p>讀者通訊箋現已印就，每册</p>
<p>百張裝成一本，祇收成本費大洋兩角，在本館收費處發售。今後讀者通訊希望一律用該項信箋，因八月一日起，凡不用該項信箋者，本部槪不作覆。信箋上我們印就姓名，登記號數，通訊次數，通訊處，問題性質等項，讀者寫信時，務必首先依式塡好，以免發信時忘記塡入，因爲這可省去我們的許多登記手續，又便於統計應用，在讀者方面，郤無一點損失。</p>
<h3>一、借書展期至多一月</h3>
<p>本館借書，照章以一星期爲限，有許</p>
<p>多內容艱深和頁數很多的書籍，讀者往往感覺得期限已過，不能讀完，續借又爲館中不許，非常的感覺不便，現在我們定一通融辦法，指定某些書籍，可額外展期二三次至一月爲止。但讀者如要展期，仍須於到期時來館聲明並辦理展期手續。</p>
<h3>三、外埠郵借</h3>
<p>本館對於外埠郵借書籍，原祇限於本館離滬讀者，不久</p>
<p>以前，我們接到外埠許多熱心讀書的朋友，要求擴充到外埠去，本館爲折中辦法起見，對於外埠已參加讀書指導部的朋友，如需要本館供給借書，本館可變通辦法，郵借書籍，並將這項辦法，作爲臨時試辦性質，所以凡已參加本部諸君，祇要經常與我們通信討論，均可來函聲請，審查合格卽可代爲介紹至郵借部。</p>

<p>敎育消息</p>
<h3>周佛海談江蘇中等敎育之設施（一）　！在省府總理紀念週講演詞！</h3>
<p>主席、各位同志、今天乘做紀念週的機會、特地將蘇省中等敎育的設施情形、向各位作一個簡略的報告、以後如有機會、或許要將小學敎育及社會敎育分别向各位報告、使各位對於蘇省整個的敎育有一明確的槪念、</p>
<p>在報告蘇省中等敎育以前、兄弟還要將全國中等敎育的趨勢向各位略爲說明、本來中等敎育包括中學與師範及職業三部分、這三項敎育各有牠的目標、其設施的分量、應該斟對環境的需要來决定、不應特别注意某項、而忽視其他、可是實際情形並不如是、全國中等敎育的趨勢都是中學特别澎漲、師範與職業則少發展、據敎育部十九年度的統計、全國普通中學校數約佔中等學校總數三分之二、經費數約佔四分之三、學生數超過四分之二、而職業學校校數不及十分之一、經費數僅及十分之一、學生數不足百分之七、可見這種畸形的發展、是全國一致的現象、於是中學畢業生的出路、便成爲重大的問題、因爲中國的中學在課程方面是專門爲學生升學打算的、而畢業生因經濟及家庭環境關係有許多</p>
<p>是不能升學、尤其是近年來各地農村經濟破產、中學不能升學的畢業生更多、這許多不能升學的學生、在校所學的都是些普通科學、毫沒有生產技能、卽毫沒有獨立生活的本領、在家坐吃、多不情願、而又要裝模作樣、自高身分、不肯從事勞作、農家子弟入了學校卽不願再爲農夫、工家子弟入了學校、卽不願再爲工人、唯一的辦法、祗有向城市中跑、鑽營奔競、各求出路、幸運的或在各機關謀得一個小小的位置、或在小學找得一個敎員、不幸的則東飄西蕩、茫無歸宿或竟窮途落魄、挺而走險、做出許多擾亂社會危害國家的事情出來、學校出來的畢業生愈多、則在社會上浮動的分子也愈多、社會的生產分子也愈加减少、這樣的展轉辦下去、對於國家社會前途、豈不是一個絕大的危險嗎　年來敎育部對於這點認爲很嚴重、曾經規定種種的辦法來限制普通中學的澎漲、提倡職業學校的發展、最爲緊要的辦法、就是規定中等敎育中普通中學與師範及職業學校所佔經費的百分比、卽普通中學佔百分之四十、師範佔百分之二五、職業佔百分之三五、通令各省務必照這種規定支配全部經費、以求將這種畸形發展的趨勢漸漸挽救過來、</p>
<p>大家都知道蘇省中等敎育是比較的發達、公私立的中等學校爲數已有一百九十餘所、未立案的私立學校尙不在內、在經費方面、除縣立及私立不計、單僅省立的中等學校經費已達兩百餘萬元、這在各省看來已不爲不多、兄弟自到蘇以來、卽聯想到蘇省中等敎育量的發展、是否盡爲事實所需要一問題、對於這問題開始卽抱懷疑的態度、所以數年來一面對於已有的公私立中等學校設法整頓其內容、提高其程度、如調查各校圖書儀器標本之設備、頒發各科敎學進度表及即化博物等科最低限度之設備標凖等項、都是就旣成的事實爲盤頓的工夫、一面則就設備較好、環境適宜的省立學校中如蘇中·揚中·上中等校、或增加職業科、或充實其職業科經費、此外又將已停辦之蘇工恢復、將宿遷中學改爲玻璃科職業學校、將公立宜興職業學校收歸省辦、分别改爲宜興陶瓷科職業學校及宜興高級農林科職業學校、而對於私立學校請求立案的則特别愼重、不肯輕易批准、凡此種種辦法、都是基於對中等學校量的發展問題抱懷疑的態度而來、然尤恐個人听懷疑的未必盡對、則又設法舉辦各項統計、以求得事實上的根據、關於全省師資供求調查統計久已完成、而全省中等學校畢業生出路統計、亦已大部完成、根據全省師資供求調查統計、則全省小學敎師共二萬三千三百零四人、合格的一萬七千四百三十五人、不合格的五千八百六十九人、而省縣立師範學校預計至二十三年度畢業生有六千二百○九人、以之更換不合格的敎師已有餘剩、如果不合格的敎師不能全部更換、則這些師範畢業生找不到位置的將更多、這是就全體上觀察的結果、若再就部分方面觀察、則二十一二兩年度全省師範畢業生人數爲四千　百二十八人、而二十二年度推廣小學須增加敎師數不過九百六十二人、預計更換不合格敎師人數也不過一千三百五十人、通盤計算、在此兩年度內差不多有一半師範畢業生找不到位置、又再從高中師範科方面觀察、則在二十一二兩年度內、全省高中師範科畢業人數合計一千三百九十三人、而二十二年度全省推廣高級小學總級數不過五十三級、卽令此五十三級都歸高中師範科畢業生辦理、亦爲二十餘人合辦一級的現象、由此可見從任何方面觀察、全省小學師資都有供過於求的現象、又根據全省中學畢業生出路統計、則二十一年度全省高中普通科畢業生總數八百零三人、升學的五百四十七人、佔總數百分之六十八、尙有百分之四十二未能升學、初中畢業生總數雖尙有少數學校未到齊、無法統計、而就已到之學校略約計算則升學的亦不過百分之七十左右、不能升學的也在百分之三十內外、高初中合計、不能升學的已爲數不少、根據這兩方面的統計、兄弟已深信在蘇省中等敎育方面不但普通中學已不能任意澎漲、卽在師範學校也應該設法緊縮、比較别省單祇要緊縮中學一部分的、在進行上還要困難、好在剛纔脫過、兄弟對此早有覺察、所</p>
<p>以在省立中等學校方面、要使各項敎育都恰如其量、有適當的發展、尙覺易於爲力、這是兄弟所感覺欣慰的一點、</p>

<p>春秋御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯　　　　　　　就在這一輛專放爐灶的車子的後面。還有一輛車子是專做預備工作的；所謂預備工作也者，就是把那些菜餚的原料，在未下鍋之前，先加一番整理的工夫的意思。因爲有的東西是要剝皮的，有的東西是要截斷的，有的東西是要切小的；：：差不多每一種生的東西，都需要加一番整治的工作。担任這項工作的共有二十多個人，但他們還是很忙。這倒不是他們不是他們的動作太慢，實在因爲這些剝洗切的工夫是太繁了。譬如像豆芽，在下鍋之前，必須先把它莖上所生的很細的根鬚摘去，而且摘的時候還得十分用心，旣不能讓它們有一支根鬚留着，又不能把那莖的本身連帶摘去，以致糟塌了有用的東西。這樣算來，便是專派一個人來料理豆芽一樣東西，也不會怎樣空閑了。何况别的東西都得一般的調弄呢！　我們退回去再講那些爐灶：它們一共是五十座，匀匀落落地分着兩行排列在左右，彷彿是一隊端整嚴肅的禁衛軍一樣。這些爐灶裏所用的燃料便是煤球；可是因爲煤球那東西很不容易着火，所以每次都得用廢紙或木花來做引火的東西。但也不能用得太多，否則那股烟就難受了。這一部份生火的工作是那些雜差做的，爲便利叙述起見，不妨暫時稱爲丙廚夫。因爲除了他們之外，還有那眞正做廚子工作的「上手」，「下手」，可以稱爲甲廚夫和乙廚夫咧。丙廚夫一共也有五十個，就是每一個人管一座灶。甲廚夫除掉每餐各做拿手的正菜兩種外，其他便一槪不管了；乙廚夫只須當甲廚夫工作的時候，站在他的旁邊，把醬油，糖，香料之類，依次遞給他，不過因要「依次」的緣故，他們就必須同樣的懂得一些烹飪的技術了。（六七）礮台灣  陳亮　　洋人的汽車，一輛輛儘開向那兒去那兒，黃色的江水托着淡藍色的天幕，赭色的風帆張在寂寞的太空裏，蝸牛般的移動着移動着。漲潮的時候哪，高堤脚跟邊的蘆葉兒呌水給淹沒了。長些的幾根還能伸出腦袋來透着凈潔的空氣。初夏的江面吹着烘熱的風，瑾姑娘的臉兒亦給吹熱了，浮着油光的，滋潤，的紅暈我打袋裏抽出一枝烟捲兒來吸着，倚着楊柳樹，望着那生滿野草的土堡，黑色守望臺的屋頂從綠蔭叢中透露出來，側面牽牽連連的一長排鐵絲網，沒頭尾地綳着，木椿子是腐爛了「那不是淞滬戰役的陳跡嗎？那不是中國民衆反抗日本帝國軍隊侵略的原址嗎？　「是呀！是呀！」理智回答我．　我拖拖瑾的衣角，「說不定，你會躺在抗日戰士的血漬上呢，你瞧那邊的砲臺，」，「說不定我亦會躺在敵人粗蠻的屍身上的．」伊張開眼來對砲臺望着，有力地，强烈的太陽光竄進伊的眼珠子，沒像剛才那麽萎倦了。　勇壯的事蹟呵！會給予人們勇壯的情感。這個世界，道德早扔在脚底下了。這是個鬭爭的時代，殘忍的局面一幕幕展佈開啦。「瑾我們不是被壓迫民族中的兩個嗎？我們不是行將給社會摔出來的兩個嗎？我們要不要鬭爭呢？」　「自然！這時代不完全是優哉遊哉，留戀景色的時代啊！」說着，伊便站了起來，拖着我，踏着江堤上初夏的陽光，悄然地離開了礮台灣。黃色的江水，赭色的風帆：：儘讓洋人們去流覽了。飯廳裏  賢賢　　上午的未一堂課是完了，照校規是須問隔十分鐘才開飯。但是在事實上，是下課鐘響過不到二分鐘，全飯廳上近二十張桌子上，已給蓬勃有爲的靑年們，疎疎落落地佔據了。於是静寂得像古廟般的飯廳，登時充滿了生氣。　離開飯時間，還有六七分鐘，但是筷子擊桌聲，醬油碟子與檯面的衝突聲，東響西應着，直嚇得値廳的當差門屁滾尿流，一疊連聲的催着廚房開飯。　一盤盤的菜，從廚房送上飯廳，而裝進靑年們的肚子，風捲殘雲，不上三分鐘，已吃得不成模樣了。這時，在飯廳門口，又走進來了凖時進膳的十一二位。每一桌上的菜，都已吃殘的了，有甚麽好說，廚房倒灶，補開二桌。　上波初平，一波又起，在廳角裏的某一桌上，在菜碗裏找出了一頭蟑螂。這是有碍衛生的，非與廚頭交涉不可，廚頭哭喪着臉陪不是，砰的一聲，一隻碗是給某一個學生打得粉碎，算是示威。於是廚頭是屈服了，願依舊例，每桌上奉送炒肉絲一盆。　奮鬥是成功之母，學生們是得到最後的勝利了，於是歡聲充滿了飯廳。臨走時，有的哼着「桃花江是美人窩」，有的哼着「我好比，籠中鳥」，或哼着其他的曲調。但廚頭却儘躱在廚廳門口瞪白眼。矻然不動  士英「虎列拉」  誠始　　談虎色變」這句話用在現在，不是說深山的猛虎，而是說傳染的虎疫。　深山的猛虎雖然能够傷人，但是爲數很少，並且目力能見；虎疫的病菌則是細微渺小，目力難察，乘機侵入人體，便卽滋生繁殖，數達千萬！它們能致一人一家一鄉的死命，在短時間之內。「虎列拉」西名Ｃholera,中國舊稱」霍亂；」它的本身是一種螺形菌或重球菌，散佈在汚濁的空氣和不潔的飯食當中；人們不幸被它傳染，那就要發生很劇烈的吐瀉，終於不能救治！「虎列拉」一年殺人幾千萬，可說是人類的大敵；我們知道溝頭，壁角，垃圾堆，便所，：：等等汚濕的地方，就是「虎列拉」毒菌集合的大本營，我們唯一預防的辦法，就是使用國貨「亞林防疫臭水」，（五洲藥房出品）澆入它們的大本營，殺滅虎疫的病菌；這種斬草除根的辦法，可以使人們平安渡過危險的夏天。東北四連長  張恨水第三十一回　三次交鋒白衣衝雪陣　全營殉國赤眼入槍林　　　　　趙自强是位意志稍嫌薄弱，而感情極豐富的人。今天他看到殷得仁這種拚命作戰的樣子，他加增了興奮不少。自已單獨的站在城堡上，向城外望着。正出神呢，後面有人呌着老趙。回頭看時，却是田靑。這孩子今天也是滿身滿臉都沾染着黑土。在那擁腫棉大衣外面，歪背了一桿步槍。大衣的胸襟，已經擦破了兩個窟窿。他雖然還是邁開大步子走路，然而他却走的是一步一頓，十足的現出他那疲勞的樣子來。便笑道；怎麽啦？小田，你累了。田靑笑道：彼此一樣。趙自强道：小鬼眞兇，昨晚上差不點兒讓他們衝上來了。到了後半夜，我不能不上來了。這小子，今天凖來，我們又沒有無線電，請援兵眞是不容易。田靑道：别說無綫電了，要兩挺平射砲，要了一個月，答應着也有半個月，現在還是沒來。趙自强笑道：咱們認了，就是這樣幹罷。假如小鬼就是昨天晚上那一股子勁，咱們還不難對付他。田靑笑道；對付得了是對付，對付不了，也要對付。到今天，我才沒有白算是東北人。弟兄們還在東門上呢，我還有事，再會，老趙。自强來不及和他說什麽，彼此散開了。本來這個時候，誰也來不及說閑話。所以要說閑話，也就是改作鎭静。自强在堡城子上站立了一會子，忽然省悟，我發個什麽呆？事情還忙着啦。一步步緩緩的走下了城堡，只見寳芳營長帶了十幾名弟兄，又怱怱的擁上城來，見了自强，便道：趙連長在這裏很好，我正要找你呢？自强聽了這話，自然就跟在他後面走着。寳芳走到垜口，就向前面指着給自强看道：你看，這裏是正北的一條路，也是我們和口子裏的交通綫，敵人要圍困我們，必是衝出這裏來。（四一八）雨的記錄  壬子　　　一九三三年六月中旬，梅雨連綿，各地災象已成，長江水勢高漲，圻春四十八堤潰决　一八九七年六月十二日，英國巴密加木市附近，有蛙雨降落。　一九○一年六月二十一日，美國加諾萊拿州降小魚雨。同年七月十六日，比利時降蟻雨。一九一七年一月十三日，日本宮城縣石卷町降五榖雨。　「天泣」是說在沒有風也沒有雲的晴明的時候降落下來的雨。科學上的解釋（一）風的作用。（二）稀薄的雲所構成。　華南多雨，福州春季平均一星期祗兩天晴明，華北雨少，北平幾月不雨，卽雨亦僅數小時耳。　日本冬季，日本海沿岸一帶常下很大的雨。　化石雨，硫磺雨，黑雨。：：：世界珍聞  東林產兒的新記錄　　奥國維印城的，呌做瑪麗惠爾曼的婦人結婚了三十年，最近又分娩了第二十九個孩子，以至非常聞名起來了。伊今年四十五歲，而丈夫是四十九歲。自從一九零七年生了長男以來，接連地生了二十二個男孩，和六個女孩。在其間有一對是雙生子，還有在一年間生過二次孩子有二回。伊是伊的雙親的第十四個女兒，由此我們可以知道，這大槪是因爲生產和系的血統之故吧！自動式的旅館　　比國的蒲羅塞城，最近設立了一種所謂「自動式的旅館」。凡是要投宿的人，只要放入二十五法郎於該旅館前門的自動式機器中，那麽就有房間的鑰匙從這機器中滾出來。這二十五法郎就是寄宿費。各房間都是一樣的價錢，所以你只喜歡那一間房間就開那一間房間就是了。這眞是非常使人感到便利的。萬國旗的警察　　近來巴黎的街頭，出現了袖子　　上卷着外國國旗的警察，這些警察聽說都是巴黎公安局的警察外國語學校的畢業生。譬如袖子上卷着意大利國旗的，就是會講意大利語的警察，他的職務就是在於照顧意大利人旅客的一切事情。警察狼　　屬於奥國維印城公安局的警察犬中，最近加上了一隻今年六歲的狼。最初這隻狼是被獵人從山中捉來的，後來送給了維印城公安局有關係的人，試騐的人將它與犬一起受訓練，因爲生來是腦和鼻都比犬銳敏之故，所以不久就變成非常有能力的警察狼了。並且曾數次建立榮譽的功績。據專家聲稱，該警察狼在歐洲居第一云。靠蛛絲吃飯的人　　英國瑤克地方，有一個呌做約翰史哥特的男人，他是專門靠着蛛絲吃飯的人。他時常到鄉間去收集許多蜘蛛。他第一把蜘蛛立在一根棒的上面，然後把這棒輕輕地一搖，蜘蛛就會驚赫了，預備要逃而吐出蛛絲，那麽他就把蛛絲捲在另外一根棒上，一直到把蜘蛛腹中的蛛絲都捲完爲止。這種蛛絲是造經緯儀以及其他各種科學儀器不可缺少的東西，所以能够賣得很高的價錢。窮學生的苦策　　米國惠斯康新州有一位呌做喬治培克的窮學生，因爲要賺自已的學費起見，曾受僱於馬鈴薯田中困於霜害的農夫，從午夜到朝上五時爲止，乘了飛到離地百呎高的地方，洶亂空氣，以防止落霜。而這件事他竟做成功了，遂得到了四百金元，以此爲學費他又得進學校讀書了，</p>

<p>自由談普通話與「大衆語」  魏猛克　　　　　　現在的所謂「文言文復活」，其實只是燈油將盡的「回光反照」。本來不足稀奇，更用不着怎麽憂慮。倘若爲靑年人前途打算，少使他們上點無謂的當，而羣起以攻之，則雖然所耗費的氣力太可惜，在當前却還是有意義的。關於「大衆文學」的問題，好幾年前早就有人當作一個嚴重的問題來提出過，不過那時所獲得的只是一個空洞的口號，理論上的鬥爭簡直可說是完全沒有。直到一九三二年文學月報創刋時，才又由宋陽先生將這問題重行提出，這回却不但有了理論上的鬥爭的發展，並且最先涉及到「用什麽話寫」的文字本身，這實在是大衆文學急待解决的先决問題。但是，他與止敬先生戰了一個回合之後，又不幸因該誌的停刋而被延擱下來。現在，我們再提出「大衆語」的建設問題來發展討論，倘能因此而成爲一個新的運動，那意義自然更重大了，　看現在的議論，是已經同意話和文不能分開。但「用什麽話寫」，大衆有不有一種普遍的語言，我們可不可採取一種語言來做「大衆語」呢的這些問題，却似手還少有具體的意見。但從前宋陽先生是提出過了：他以爲只有「現代中國普通話」才是「大衆語」，才是大衆中間的普遍的語言。不過他所指的普通話，主要的是「現代化的工廠」裏面流行的那種話。所以經止敬先生調查的結果，知道還是以當地士白爲基本，仍然不是普遍性的大衆所能懂得的話。其實，「現代中國普通話」是有普遍性的，牠是主要的流行在輪船，火車，碼頭，車站，客棧，飯舖，遊藝塲等處。工廠不過也受到影響，這是客籍的工人帶進去的，但因爲他們的生活不是流動的，久之就要和當地的語言同化。所謂普通話是因爲交通發達，各地人們往來日漸密切，要求交涉上的便利而產生的。所以牠的目的只在要人懂。牠不是容納各種土話，牠是竭力避免各種土話。牠在企圖每名話都能够說得出，寫得出，每個字眼都找得出意義來。牠比北平話簡潔，少「兒」「啦」等語尾詞。自然，「現代中國普通話」還沒有達到完善之境地，有時還夾雜些所謂「南腔北調」（零碎的土語），但牠必然會隨着交通發達而進展，隨着社會意識的轉變而轉變。中國處在現在世界的狂潮之下，語言的統一當然不是久遠的事，那時統一的語言爲「現代中國普通話」轉變而成，大約也未必會錯。所以我想，採取有普遍性的「現代中國普通話」作爲建設「大衆語」文學的基凖，是可以的。作家在作品中盡量採納普通話，也未必不是文學接近大衆的初步，完全用普通話寫文章，將來也許要變成最明朗簡潔的文章。　我對於採用土話的主張很懐疑，土話是原始的，沒有進步性的語言。土話寫出來只讀得出聲音，找不出意義（音義雙全的「土話」，便是人人可懂人人能說，不成其爲土話了，卽如「搗蛋」一語，便非山東人也常說，）試拿張天翼君的小說來看，他最喜用的一句駡語是：「奶奶雄」，這「奶奶雄」我們可知道是指什麽東西呢？又如「啊啦」，「頂括括」，「乖乖噲」等語，倘非當地人是不能從字面上理解其含義的。一篇文章用許多看不懂的土話，卽使加了註釋，那效果與搬用成語和典故，又有什麽分别麽！　「大衆語」文學的建設是艱難的工作，還需要更多的研究和論爭。倘談到土話的採用時，則希望不要忽略了牠現在在文學作品上所收到的是怎樣的效果。正是時候  張承祿　　「山梁雌雉，時哉時哉！」東西是自有其時候的。　聖經，佛典，受一部分人們的奚落已經十多年了，「覺今是而昨非」，現在就是復興的時候。關岳，是淸朝屢經封贈的神明，被民元革命所閒却，從新記得，是袁世凱的晚年，但又和袁世凱一同蓋了棺，而第二次從新記得，則是在現在。　　這時候，當然要重文言，掉文袋，標雅致，看古書。　如果是小家子弟，則縱使外面怎樣大風雨，也還要通往直前，拚命掙扎的，因爲他沒有安穏的老巢可歸，只得向前幹。雖然成家立業之後，他也許修家譜，造祠堂，儼然以舊家子弟自居，但這究竟是後話。倘是舊家子弟呢，爲了逞雄，好奇，趨時，喫飯，固然也未必不出門，然而只因爲一點小成功，或者一點小挫折，都能够使他立刻就退縮。這一縮而且縮得不小，簡直退回家，更壞的是他的家乃是一所古老破爛的大宅子。　這大宅子裏有倉中的舊貨，有壁角的灰塵，一時實在搬不盡。倘有坐食的餘閒，還可以東尋西覓，那就修破書，擦古瓶，讀家譜，懷祖德，來消磨他若干歲月。如果是窮極無聊了那就更要修破書，擦古瓶，讀家譜，懷祖德，甚而至于翻骯髒的牆根，開空虚的抽屜，想發見連他自已也莫名其妙的寳貝，來救這無法可想的貧窮。這兩種人，小康和窮乏，是不同的，悠閒和急迫，是不同的，因而收塲的緩促，也不同的，但當這時候，却都正在古董中討生活，所以那主張和行爲，便無不同，而聲勢也好像見浩大了。　于是就又影響了一部分的靑年們，以爲在古董中眞可以尋出自已的救星。他看看小康者，是這麽閒適，看看急迫者，是這麽專精，這，就總應該有些道理。會有仿傚的人，是當然的。然而，時光也絕不留情，他將終于得到一個空虚，急迫者是妄想，小康者是玩笑。主張者倘無特操，無灼見，說古董應該供在香案上或擲在茅厠裏，其實，都不過在盡一時的自欺欺人的任務，要尋前例，是隨處皆是的戀  邵冠華　　月亮拉長屋影，如條黑巖石。橫在橡樹下，狗子不會呑。ＸＸＸ夏風括過小河，屋陰下來一個黑影。黑影移動了，搭在另一個的肩上。孩子  周楞伽　　　　　　　　來，差不多成子習　般的，只要一聽到孩子的哭聲，就忍不住要過去抱起他，在房裏來回地走。　孩子的脾氣也眞古怪，别人抱着他，老是哭個不停，只要一到我手上，抱着他在房裏走了兩三轉，他便不哭了。先是張着眼打呵欠，接着眼皮便垂了下來，同時鼻息也輕微地發出了，這常常引起被孩子纏擾到筋疲力盡的妻極大的驚異，每次見到孩子熟睡在我手上，她總要笑着向我說：　「想不到你竟有這樣的本領，倒是個抱孩子的慣家！」　聽了妻的話，再望到在手上的孩子的睡態，我不自覺的安慰地笑了。於是，抱孩子這一椿事，便成了我日常功課之一。我是這樣的感覺；犧牲一些自已去造福别人，是這時代每個人所應爲的事，何况睡在我手上的，是我自已的孩子呢。　然而，這事情，漸漸的竟給了我極大的麻煩。孩子的脾氣是那樣古怪，也許是在我手上安適地睡慣了。除了夜間照例的一次熟睡以外，其他的時候，總不肯親一親枕蓆，就是把他放在車子裏推着也不行，他只是哭，一直要哭到我過去把他抱起纔罷。我素來是個把時間看得寳貴的人，一旦要在每天的生活裏，　出一部分時間來放在抱孩子這事上，不用說是要感到不耐的。尤其是有時正當提筆作着文章的時候，孩子忽然哭了起來，打斷了我的思路，雖然勉强擱下筆過去抱他，心却仍舊懸縣在那篇文章上。這就不能不想一個變通的辦法：等他在我手上睡熟了，便把他轉移到他母親手裏去。可是，就在這一轉移之間，他又醒了，又本能地哭了起來，使我無法把他放鬆。好幾次在厭煩到極點的時候，我止不住想橫一橫心，把他抛在牀上，聽憑他去哭，但總不忍這樣做。我只好對妻說：　「我們還是雇一個奶媽來領他罷！」　妻搖搖頭，對於我這提議，她常持着反對的態度。反對的理由是很充足的。第一當然是他的奶水多，用不着每月出八九元的工銀去另雇一個奶媽。其次是上海風俗澆薄，做奶媽的多半靠不住，她不放心把孩子交給她們去領。爲了證實她的話，她更舉出不久以前某家的奶媽因解雇懷恨把鋼針喂小孩的事作例，說雇用奶媽帶領孩子，是只有增加孩子的危險性的。　有着這些理由，於是我便不得不耐着心，每天匀出時間來抱孩子了。　大抵不論什麽事情，只要一成了習慣，便會發生出一種趣味來。最初把抱孩子看做一椿厭煩事的我，日子一久，倒覺得一刻不抱孩子，心頭恍惚若有所失了。瞧着孩子睡在我手上，緊閉着他的小眼珠，頭微微仰起着，口張開成半月形，從他的小鼻孔裏吐出香甜的鼻息來，我總要感到一種無名的喜悅。想到他未來的成就也許要遠勝於我這不成材的父親，我更忍不住由衷地微笑了。這笑常常會把孩子驚醒過來的。　可異的是我近來的氣質和心境都有了改變，平素浮躁的習氣不知道到那裏去了，現在是能非常耐心地處理每一件事情。這暗暗使我奇怪，難道抱孩子這事，對於我竟有這末大的影響嗎？我也曾把這可異處和一位朋友談起過，回答却出於意外地使我吃了一驚。　「這不算什麽，每個從靑年轉入中年的人，都是這樣的。」不錯，我近來的心境的確有些近似中年了，我非常執着現在，對於未來雖也存着不少奢望，但已不像幾年前那樣濃厚。誰知道我的靑春竟已在我不知不覺中倫倫地溜跑了呢！這靑春的消夫，在我的生命名上，是怎樣重大的損失呵！當孩子又一次睡到我的手上來時，我不禁有些惘然了。淄博印象  羅王　　（一）我們底巡迴演劇爲着巡迴講演底工作，我們曾到過山東產煤區域淄川博山兩縣。　我們所依附的組織，是民衆敎育館巡迴講演團。所到地方，夜晚演露天電影：白天演老百姓所稱爲「新戲」，我們自已呌作「化裝講演」。　每到一處，城隍廟和關帝朝，常是我們底寄托所；廟裏戲台便是我們上好的工作塲。我們掛上了灰色軟幕，應用所凖備好了的服裝。一個下午，起碼五幕劇，還加上閉幕時間的講話，解釋劇情和劇旨，三四小時的戲，三五千（？）的民衆擠得密密層層地站在那兒看，從他們底笑聲與淚滴中，看出了我們底戲是爲他們所了解。這班觀衆常是勞苦的農民，而士大夫階級至多不過百分之五六，所以大部分是短衣，布襖，踝足，背油簍，掮麻袋的。　事實給證明了，話劇能爲大衆所喜悅，而且我們常常和「西關」「南關」的「走鄉班子」，或「五人班」打對台，拉得他們開鑼無人去看戲。我們到處總形成一地方臨時的市集，正如廟會一般。想起熊佛西陳治策兩先生在定縣農民劇之試騐，與我們底巡迴各縣各鎭各麥塲之演劇，證明了話劇並非是「洋把戲」，而爲大衆願意接受的東西。因此我們却也隨處走走，增進了不少的見聞。　能演那適合大衆生活的戲劇給大衆看，而又爲大衆所能了解，這可以稱爲一種大衆的戲劇。至於局促在都市一角落的中產知識階級圈子裏的演劇，雖然理論怎樣地高超，實際上仍舊接觸不了短衣大衆，甚至所演的戲不能爲大衆所接受。我想與其那樣空呌，我們還是不如從實際工作中去找問題，多埋頭，少爭辨的好，說起來，這也就是我們三四年來巡迴演劇的實施不願大吹大擂示於人前的原因。　　爲着說明我「爲什麽」有淄博之行，順便先寫了這麽一小段引子。霧（續）  高爾基近作宜閑譯　　在這城市裏，鞋帽，衣服，毛皮，革製品，衣箱，雪茄，烟斗，手杖，瓷器，釣具，獵槍，還有給孩子們和給成年人用的玩具，還有金的，寳石的錶，好不豐富呵！這一切的繁華是使人眼花的。這些物品這麽燦爛的晃耀着，至於這班紳士們，太太們是否有使用這些物品的權利這一個問題竟消失在迷人的光輝裏了。　這裏有着種類非常繁多的食品，反映出美食學的進步，烹調術的發達，以及對於受高等敎養的人們的食慾的精細的研究來。在伙食舖的窗子裏，驕傲地陳列着全世界的，一切大陸，海洋，湖泊，森林和江河的物產。新鮮的，燻過的，鹽漬的，保藏着的肉，魚，牡蠣，野味，蔬菜，水菓，醬油，乳酪，調味品，糕餅，餅乾，罐頭食品，巧克力，可可！！都無疑地，成千噸的聚在一起，而這一切得由太太們，紳士們來咀嚼，消化，以變成大地的肥料。沿着有許多單調的每層三四道窗子的三層樓房屋的荒凉的街，！！沿着這荒凉的街，有一個穿蘇格蘭民族裝的長腿的人在濃霧裏急怱怱地大踏步走。他戴的是有兩條絲帶掛在後邊的帽子，穿的是左肘上有一條破綻的很舊的短衣，以及長到裸露的膝部的短褲；他的脚上是一雙笨大的破鞋。　他在臂膀下，用左肘夾住一支「風笛」紅的手指輕叩在笛孔上，便從笛管發出甜美歡樂的調子來，單調的嗡嗡的沈音反應了這調子。　那音樂家的臉又灰白又瘦削他突着頰骨，將皮綳緊得顯出紅紅的疤來。他的鼻頭尖藏在氣得直聳的紅鬍鬚裏，他的下巴上也蓋着一蓬濃密的紫銅色的硬毛。他臉上最惹眼的是深深的眼眶裏一雙眼晴。那靑色的瞳子似乎浮在發赤的眼球的表面；雖是浮着，可也發出光來，人就不由地要說這雙眼發燒了。　那音樂家在四所房屋的窗下急急地走了八十三步，回到那富庶的街的角落，又復逞着狂人的頑强，蹣跚着走開去，他肘上的破綻彷彿打算脫落似的飄着。脹大了兩頰，動一下鬍鬚，他便在「風袋」裏裝滿空氣了。他從嘴上取下笛子來之後，咳一陣，吐一口痰，繼續大踏步走。這是什麽緣故呢？原來警察禁止着他在富人們的窗下彈奏，免得擾害他們的安静。他只在走動的時候，纔可以彈奏，因爲英吉利！！這妥恊主義國家！的王的臣民是自由的。那音樂家咳一陣，吐出幾口暗沈沈的血塊來。彷彿不願將那血踏在他那汚濁的鞋底下面似的，他並不吐在人行道上，却吐在最下一層的房屋的濕膩膩的牆邊。他這麽着可也似乎並不怎麽用心，人料到他再走十多步，因爲疲乏和飢餓的緣故，一定要倒在地上的。　譯者按：這短篇是高爾基最近的作品，讀去簡直是一首蒼凉的散文詩。可惜我的譯筆拙陋，不能將原作的詩的韵味多多地傳達出來。篇中所說起的「風笛」（Ｂagpipe）是皮製的袋和四支長短不同的笛管所搆成的一種樂器。彈奏者將皮袋插在腋下，從最長的笛管將那袋吹脹了，撳以腕部，使空氣通過旁的笛管，同時用手指變換地按在最短的笛管的許多孔上，便有音調從那裏發出。從其他兩支笛管也就發出一定的沈音。這種樂器在蘇格蘭很流行。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言文言和白話論戰宣言  垢佛　　　　　　　　文言文和「白話文」的戰局，文開始地重演起來了，這問題眞是一個很嚴重的問題，亦眞是很値得研究和討論的問題。　記者旣不是「古文」專家，又不是「白話文」的老手，頭腦冬烘如我，决不敢偏袒任何一方，但記者對於黃臉老婆，天然還有一些薰情，而對於如花似玉的新人，又是十分的鍾愛，使人怎樣去解决這嚴重而很困難的問題呢？　因爲這問題太嚴重，所以不敢有所主張，亦不敢輕易去判斷甲方是是，乙方是非，亦因爲該問題太有嚴重性，更不可不去謀根本解决的方案，我們這裏，只有暫開一個民衆的法庭，請雙方當事人，各舒偉論，以待當世學者來批判不過雙方的當事人須認淸問題，不可别生枝節，討論到問題以外，亦不可混戰一塲，毫無秩序，使極嚴重極困難的問題，得不到一些良好的結果，和印象，這是很爲惋惜的事。　此外還有一個問題，現在「白話文」中，又新發現了一枝異軍，呌做」大衆語。」所謂大衆語者，到底怎樣一種文字呢？有的說「大衆語」有三個條件，一可以講，二可以聽，三可以寫，果眞這樣，則現在的白話文，何嘗不可以講不可以聽，不可以寫呢？若離開三個條件，根本上便不成爲白話文字。　有的說，「大衆語」卽是用各地的方言來連綴成文便是，若果如此，記者還有一些疑問，我國的方言，各處不同，倘用粤省的方言，我們江蘇人不懂，倘用江蘇的方言，湖南河北等省的人，恐亦不大明瞭，我想大衆語也决不如此簡單，可否請幾位提倡「大衆語」的作家，發表幾篇「大衆語」的標凖作品，使記者和讀者，大家來欣賞欣賞，研究研究，到是一個極有趣味極有價値的問題呢　更有一事聲明，討論「文言文」和「白話文」，是一個戰局，討論「白話文」和「大衆語」，又是一個戰局，雙方須將兩問題，分别討論，不可渾爲一談，使讀者易得認識，不致眼花撩亂口難言。　假令該兩問題實有連帶性的話，亦請雙方把主張臚陳明白，或者反對大衆語」，而并反對「白話文」，或者非但反對「文言文」，并「白話文」亦在反對之列。或贊成「白話文」而「大衆語」則絕不贊同，請將各人的主張，顯明地寫出來以供當世的探考和研究，這眞是記者和讀者掬誠企求的事實。慢性自殺  佳乃　　每天，到了可以睡的時候，便爬上牀去，到了可以喫飯的時候便去喫飯，除此之外一點也不明白自已到底在幹些什麽。糊裏糊塗過日子，難道這樣便說是一個人的生活麽。　是的，我何曾不知道生活决不止於物質的享受與滿足而已，越過物質以上尙有另一種更有意義更有價値的生活在，可是這個，離開我離得非常之遠，或是永遠地是一個夢。我祗看見！也許一般人都如我一樣。普天下之人皆是食肉之徒，每一個人成天成日在忙碌不休，芸芸然有如糞中之蛆在攢着攢着，爲的什麽，無非都是爲肚子問題吧。　至於我自已，終朝亦如人家的奔忙，相信除了吃喝睡覺以外。完全不曉得幹嗎要這樣。若說此外懷着任何的目的和野心的話，那我已說過，始終是個夢。於是我開始感到懷疑了，人眞是爲生活而生活，那樣子還有什麽興强意趨呢？簡直變成一塊木頭，一架機械，甚於</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>至一個贅疣。我能够做些什麽事呢？捨開是一條寄生蟲之外，我還有什麽力能。社會之中你我這專一種人實在是最不需要的多餘者。於已無益，於世無補的多餘者。於是我又感覺到生的恥辱，對自已的生命起了極大的憎恨，有些時候想以自已的手割斷自已的𩓐子，早一點�告别人間，可以減少一點罪惡。然而我又放開眼晴看一看有一班人比我更該死的更混帳的，尙且很快樂很有興緻的活下去，那我何必一定要如此固執呢，活一天算一天不是好麽。人生原就是一個戲台，喜劇也罷，悲劇也罷，管他苦呢還是樂，敷衍下去算了。　於是偷生的念頭支配了我的一切，隨時俯仰，與俗浮沉，再也不苦苦追究生活的意義了。對於目睹耳聞的一切的事事物物。不會引起我特别的興奮，自然卽在心境十分愉快的時候，也决不會把人生看得如何好，如何美麗。反而，對於一些爲人所認爲有害於身體的事，却是格外喜歡去做，去接近。因爲我根本便不曾將生命加以重惜，譬如酒的一回事，每天幾乎非飲不可，爲什麽，連自已亦莫明其妙，也並不是借它來消愁。只覺得它有一種不可思議的誘惑力，一見酒，大有未飲先醉之槪，它可以令我的情感和理智完全失了作用，忘記了一切，雖飽了酒，獰着赤紅的眼暗，想打人，想駡人，想放聲大哭，都能隨意所之，不受到一絲的束縛，這時候就變成一個英雄漢子，眞痛快不過的啊！本來，每天很有次序地十點鐘左右便就寢，明兒一淸早便溜下來，但是爲什麽要這樣有規則呢。可憐的啊，於是我又反叛了，消沉到一些最惡濁最足以有身心的地方去熬夜，絲毫不以爲可怕，有何可怕呢，到了天明，始牠着快要死去的身體回家，側在床上，一直睏到下午才起來。瞧鏡子，一面黃色的死灰的臉孔映了出來，是一天天地瘦了啊，可是我却微微地笑着。快定了吧！Ｄiene的白髮  陳亮　　寂寞的街哪。打喧鬧的都市邊岸，經過一小時的水程！到了這兒。　繁俗，全呌遺忘啦，讓柔軟的白帆布鞋的膠底扔在靑灰色的石板上，是不會驚覺了什麽的，躺在黑牆門口的黃狗，依然那麽躺着，蹲在矮屋子裏織布的女人，依然那樣勤苦地織着。　除掉一些木機的聲響，除掉一些孩子的哭呌，全然沒有别種聲音，多麽幽静的境域呵。「你也愛幽静麽？Ｄianeo」祗點了點腦袋兒，沒說話。她藏着一顆十七歲的姑娘幽嫻的心。「噹：：」的！鐵杓子敲在鐵鍋上的聲音，吃飯的時候啦，太陽重重的壓在她那頂西湖紙傘上，太陽重重地壓在我的大邊子草帽上。肚子裏就感到空虚：「吃了飯再上海濱去吧。」「也好，休息一回兒。」Ｄianeo的臉上貼着小的汗珠子，腮膀兒通紅，給烤過的燒鴨似的，她平常沒出過遠路，她是一頭養在金絲籠裏小鳥呵。「疲倦了嗎，今天累了你。」「你可别這樣　笑我。」　便胡亂地走上一家菜館。揀窗口邊坐下。她静肅地不說什麽，除掉在我點菜的時候，呌我少點幾樣外。雖在鬧哄哄的館子裏，我們這一角始終是冷寂的。憂慮的人常常歡喜保守住一種無底的冷寂。　「難得到鄉鎭上來跑跑，你可生些什麽感想？」我故意要把冷寂打破。　「有什麽感想呢，祇覺得鄉鎭的生活比我們更寂寞，更空虚罷了，」Ｄiane，搓了搓手掌，烏溜溜的眼珠子儘睜着窗外，綣曲的頭髮拖在肩上，她有着一個玉琢成似的鼻子，和珊瑚磨成似的嘴唇。靑春的光彩息留在她的雙頰上，她要是生了兩張翅膀，她要是那她就該被人呌作「愛神」的。　「Ｄiane，那末，我要問啦，你對於你自已的人生觀念怎樣？」　「那我不能澈底的回答你：最可寳貴珍愛的時代過去了，懷着希望火星的年頭還沒有來臨，我最惡恨着的是現實！十七歲不能給予我什麽：：」說到這裏的話就輕下啦。　「你期待着的。該是十八歲了？」「不過，我對於十八歲也沒有什麽過份的奢望。祇希冀向來束縛我的舊禮敎　　跟舊的時代淘汰，或者，年紀會使我增加起反抗的力量。可寳貴的十六歲以前的童年時代消逝了。我只有把我完全的希望放置在成年時代」　吃過飯，搭汽車到了海濱。六月的風打海面上滾過來，黃色的海水捲着螺旋紋兒儘向灘邊衝，衝去了心坎中久積着的沉鬱，衝去了沿途帶來的疲乏。我和Ｄiane沿着灘踱去，在淺黃色的沙舖成的柔毯上，輕輕地發出「沙沙沙：」的音律，在偏僻的一個所在坐了下來，沉默着。　我無意中在Ｄiane的腦袋上發現一根白髮，白洋綫似的那麽一根。　「怎？這樣年輕的人就白了頭髮。」我帶着異覺地說。　「拔掉它，替我拔掉它。」她却毫沒意思的模樣兒。　我伸着顫慄的手指替她拔去了，交在她手中，她用着兩支細瘦的指兒攀。她開始在臉上浮起一層陰晦，她怕，她怕再有第二根。　「這樣，亮；我對未來又起了駭怕　Ｄiane爲什麽不努力現實呢，現實是人生中不能放過的時代啊，一我又申說「　　　　　　驚濤驚浪中的船隻，除掉竭力挽救當時的危機外，能憧憬着過去和希望着未來的平安嗎！　她像在夢中驚醒過來，她這時的心已不再是那樣一顆幽嫻的心了。時代的女性  周希文　　　　　看了時代的兒女之後，同時在我的腦子裏便明瞭了這時代兩個字的意義，時代便是隨着潮流學時髦的原理。我們誰也知道上海是個著名的大商埠，也便是一個畸形的大都市，在這形形色色的都市裏面，當然更容易顯出時代的新潮流來，就像現在的夏季時光一到，馬路上的行人都受了暑氣的洗禮，便換上了一種新奇凉爽的夏季服裝來，又其是靑年男女們，愛修飾的哥兒公子們，他們（或她們）一到了夏季裏，便要穿一種更引人注目的衫服，到可總要帶些摩登化，西洋化，肉感化，否則便不能稱爲摩登漂亮的哥兒公子。我們如果在空餘的時光，在馬路上走走，便時常可以看到一兩個妙齡女郎穿的輕紗旗袍，露出雪白的兩臂，宛若鮮藕，資得水浪形的頭髮，臉兒稍爲塗些輕粉淡脂，分外鮮艷，使人看了，眞要垂涎，所謂路人便都要目逆而送之了。談起她們這些女郎的性情，當然不能一槪而論，也有急燥的　也有溫　的，也有貞節的，也有不知　恥一天到晚只想戀愛的，所謂時代的</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>女性者，便是高唱男女平等，社交公開的口號者，打扮得妖形怪狀，媚色迷人，吸引幾個小白臉兒來做做朋友，以後便由友誼而成爲情人，由情人而變爲夫婦，這種現象是都市裏極普通而不作爲奇的事情，而有的是單戀成爲雙戀，也有三角戀愛而戀爲四角戀愛的，甚至十七八角的戀愛都有，總之都市裏是無奇不有，所謂社交公開，男女平等便是這種玩意兒，把眞正極有價値提倡的新潮流，新道德，都給這些無知恥辱的靑年男女弄得一榻糊塗，變了戀愛公開，自由結合的口號勿怪有些舊腦筋的老頭子要搖頭大駡現代的潮流世風不古，原來是給這些媚人精靈催殘靑春的娘子妖怪們所弄槽的事情，往往軋軋朋友不到一個月光景，但成了什麽情人，意中人，這類的東西，還有一種肉麻的稱呼什麽小妹妹，小寳貝，我的天使，小心肝，親愛的小肉肉，這些怪難聽的呼聲，或許他們（或者她們）以爲這種的稱呼最爲摩登親密，合於時代化的，一做了情呂之後，往往終日相偕不肯離散半步，好像一離半步，便要給人家搶得去的一樣，忽而由情侶變爲了夫婦，這是極多的事情，往往今天心心相印，情意纒繞，明天冷淡隔膜，宛若沒有這回把戲，今天登報爲結婚啓事，明天成爲離婚啓事的也很多，結婚是一件極輕而易舉的事情，無庸考慮，無庸研究，用不到怎樣隆重其事，好在都市裏人們是看慣這種把戲的啦，這是不作爲奇的事，今天夫婦，明天便有變成朋友的可能，昨天是朋友，也有明天成了夫婦，這種事情眞是好玩，眞像孩子們弄玩的一樣，做律師的先生們，乘着這種離婚的事件一多，便可多一筆生意收入，好在辦理這種事情也不十分的費力，則要有話說過便是了，用不到多加爭辯。（却酬）失敗  魔　　祇要是親戚們聚會的時候，就是王太太誇張她有眼力有見識的好機會。不過這是學學關於她女兒的事，因爲三年來，她向每一個角落去挑選合於她理想的標凖女婿，現在對於這偉大工作的完成，自然是値得大吹大擂誇口的時候了。人才是怎樣的英俊漂客，家道是怎樣的殷實富庶，以及一切可以以最高的形容字句去加諸她的未來的女婿。且别說她女兒將來的生活，就是王太太自已的地位或者也因之增高，所以當她說得高興烈采的時候，覺得她周圍的那些窮親戚不免是很大的遺憾，因爲將來新婿上門的時候，不是有損她的體面嗎？　而那些親戚們呢？也直覺王太太確是個有眼力有見識的女英雄，不然，她那裏覓得到這一門女兒親呢！雖然那些親戚們並不像王太太想像的那樣窮困，但是對於王太太的成功，不免讚譽很自然的從各個不同的嘴巴中流露出來。因之，王太太在自族中的地位增高，並不是一個空想的幼夢。　彷彿風一般的迅速，曾一般的有力，王太太在這族中已是個不可一世的人物了，她的一句話甚至就是法律。甥兒大毛的失業，就被王太太臭駡一頓：說是一定做事不安心，才被經理先生辭退出來。雖然大毛竭力辯白，公司因市面不景氣而辭退了不少職員，但王太太是那樣地肯定，如其大毛眞是好好做事的話，公司不會辭退别人嗎？這一次依據了法律的裁判宣决了大毛的罪名之後，姪兒們的逛跳舞塲，吃花酒，都被王太太一一的審問過，而且她是賞罰分明，被判决的人是沒有上訴的餘地的。　到她嫁女兒的日子，更是大忙特忙，她將女兒的妝奩備得特别豐富，這不是王太太的故意擺闊，不然是顯不出她女英雄的手段的。雖然大毛說是王太太借了一筆巨債，但是儘可以置之不信。　在福氣的氛圍中王太太做了一個月快樂的夢。　彌月新夫婦雙雙挈手歸寗，對於這位高貴的女婿，王太太又是一番忙碌。幸喜從前王太太憂心的那些窮親戚們沒有如她想像的失了她的體面，而且衆口一辭的贊美這位新姑爺的人才出衆，這一喜，王太太幾乎反不自信這一件偉大工作是她造成的。　女婿當夜沒有住在岳家，這理由王太太知道得最親楚，但是她說：因爲姑爺公司裏事情忙，解釋了那些親戚們的疑問。　一個藝術家完成了一件傑作之後，他應該有一個長時間的修養。王太太自然一樣，她現在覺得遍體骨骼都舒適的解放開來。晚上她不免想問問女兒姑爺家中一切的情形，但是提起了第一句話，她女兒一個翻身向裏床後再也不見開口，這一點是太使王太太驚奇了，她起初還以爲女兒害羞，但是她將女兒翻過身來的時候，發現了女兒的眼淡。　王太太自然也是由小姐時代而到母親時代的，女兒哭的理由她豈有不知道淸楚的理由？不過她理在是這一族中的女英雄了，她的一句話就是法律，她能公開地承認這一次是失敗了嗎？故鄉  玲妮　　人生原是奥妙的，而且是不可思議的，自從故鄉道聲「珍重」後，身體漂泊到意想不到的所在。遊子的脚踪，如鴻泥般留印到曾到過的地方。以其是漂泊的遊子，所以嘗到客地的境况，常使我追戀到故鄉的可愛。　原是，故鄉是可頌謳的，可追味的，何况是有詩味的故鄉！　人，是有感情的動物，因爲有感情的衝動，所以連貫的思想，會激起無窮的慨嘆。　在某個晚霞的凄迷裏，我步出一隻載滿求生的人們的輪船，重回到了我生命產生地的故鄉。　故鄉！依舊無恙，依然是昔日的故鄉：蜿蜒的城郭，包容着多數的生靈盈盈的水波，織着無盡數的錦漪，巍聳的高塔，瞻望着遙遠的蒼山。一切兒時的憧憬，重溫上心頭；但兒時的情景，都成了被風吹破了的泡沫！　然而踏上了街上，倐變了花樣，所不同的點綴，有：漆亮的包車，有奇裝炫服的賣淫婦，有改頭換面的里巷，有外表華麗的洋房：：：畸形的發展，低層的基礎，都建築在農村破產的農民血汗上，給享樂者壓榨着！壓榨着！　人們也對我驚異：那來的遊子？那來的浪跡？他們已遺忘了我，我似乎已不容站足在故鄉了！　終於，我仍被追上了征途，　故鄉的外形雖然無恙，但是內臟的病態，已漸顯露着糜爛，我對故鄉的熱戀，不意竟空費了在異鄉時幻夢裏的追尋！撤謊和誠實  何覺夫　　誠實，是歷來被人認爲美德的。當你偕着你的朋友在大街上走時，如果對面跑來一個你的曾認識的人，你偷偷地指着他對你的朋友說：「這個人是很誠實的，」你的朋友必於不知不覺問起了敬佩之情，用一種欽羨的眼光，對他凝看；如果說：「這是一個謠言專家，」那你的朋友就會生了不快之感，連對他睬一眼也覺不大高興了。司馬光的身世事蹟，至今尙被一般人絮絮地熟誦着，原因就是他不說謊話之故。　誠實的人，是被人家這樣的尊崇敬重，撤謊的人，是被人家這樣的深惡痛絕‘照理，世界上，就應當多有誠實這種人存在着。但，事實是怎樣的呢？大家是有眼晴的，大家可以張開眼晴來看看一回。社會上，除幾個鈍魯的傻漢，不曉得如何玩弄玄虚外，稍略聰明之士，不是誰都長於撤謊撞騙這一枝，到處施展嗎？　關於撤謊的人之多的這一點，一般人都認爲撤謊是有利可圖的，所以大家才同趨這一途，這當然是有道理的；但我覺得除此之外，最大的原因恐還是由於一般人愛聽謊你之故。一宗平常的事件的產生，誰知將這事件的始末，原原本本說給人家聽，聽者是會感到倦厭的；如將事件擴大開去，說得天花亂墜，玄虚莫測，那聽者就感到十分快意和歡悅了。「科學靈乩」，原是件很平常很淺白的東西，但，虚構一些不可理喻的鬼你加進去，一般人就因此而顚倒了；人的面貎軀體，原是來自自然，並沒有什麽神秘的東西在上面，但，被人憑空說着，由此足以測知人的生死吉凶：：等事情來，就被一般人所欽服了，甚且，有的是明知道人家所說的爲謊話，他也常樂於聽聞的。人旣是愛聽希奇古怪，理知莫能解釋的話，才覺有趣；而天地間，這樣的事情，爲要迎合聽者這些趣味心理，最後說者只落得將說你誇張，另添枝節了。　一方旣尊重誠實者，一方又厭煩聽實話；一方旣深惡說謊者，一方又樂意聽謠言，人的心理是多矛盾的。爲要將撤謊者鏟除，首先就要將這矛盾的心理改正過來。</p>

<p>業餘信箱稱呼困難編者先生：　　大約在七年前我的一個表姊因不堪她丈夫的虐待而離婚了。把有一個親生女兒留在已離的丈夫那裏。我的表姊已另和人正式結婚，而她已離的丈夫，現在流落得將成乞丐。窮困迫着人向堕落路上走他自已都不能自立，怎還有養活女兒的能力。據說他現在要出賣他底女兒的意思。這個消息給我母親知道了，因和表姊有骨肉關係，不忍被别人買去受苦。我母親很願收買爲女，這當然是可以的，但是稱呼却有商量的必要了，難道她稱！我的母親爲媽，稱我約表姊爲姐麽？倘使以我出面收買爲女，：：；甥女當女，倫常上也無問題，：不過鄙人尙未過婚，這怎麽可以呢？因爲如此，所以有幾個長輩們正在計議討論，結果，總沒有完善辦法。鄙人的意見主張打破稱呼，收買爲我的妹妹，做我母親的女兒，未知先生以爲然否？倘使先生能給我更好更妥的辦法，那末鄙人更是樂願接受先生底指敎。專此順祝，撰安周鐵桅，　答：你提出的問題，無論從那方面想，我總覺得是不成問題的。第一，你母親旣然爲了骨肉關係，而要自已收養，那何必一定要使她非做自已人的女兒不可，保持她原來的地位不好麽？仍舊做你甥女不好麽？第二，稱呼我覺得總是不値得爭論的，尊名分，重長幼這些都是宗法社會裏的倫理觀念。我們現在固不必完全廢除親族間的稱呼，却也無過分重視的必要。據說五四以後，陳獨秀和邵力子的兒子，寫信給父親，竟直呼其號如「仲甫」或「力子」。這種風氣我們也不必提倡，因爲父親對，於子女的特權雖無根據，但把稱呼更改，却是無所謂得很。至於你們則恰巧相反，因爲稱呼關係竟至議論不决。因噎廢食，未免太不値得了。以所，我認爲，你母親如注意要收養稱呼是儘可不必計較的。李大成先生作品  李大成自我職業介紹　　陳君，浙籍，畢業持志附中，曾任某大公司營業部職員，書局校對，現欲就報館，書局校對，或公司小職員，不論本外埠均可，祇需供膳宿，略給津貼，通訊處中山路三鑫里六號收轉。　李君，上海籍，現年二十七，大學肄業歷任洋行公司學校等處職務多年擅英語國學，尤富有商業常識，敎授經騐，薪水不計，且有殷實舖保，如蒙採納請通信至楊樹浦路長安里十二號。　某女士，蘇籍，高中畢業，市敎育局檢定合格，已執敎鞭數年，尤工湘綉，茲願就小學或家庭敎師（中小學剌綉亦可擔任）薪金不計，如欲聘任者，請賜函新閘路鳳祥里二十一號薛君轉。　朱斌君，年十五，鎭海人，初中程度，備有殷實舖保，茲願就銀行洋行或公司寫間練習生，如需此項人材者請投函虹口蓬路廣興里二一零五號。　Ｃ女士，嘉善人，年十八，初中程度，現欲謀一職位，如書局，報館，洋行，銀行，商店職員或練習生等職，均所願就，能英文打字，薪金不計，通訊處郵政信箱三一七號羅君轉。　某君，年四十歲畢業於大學，精國學數理，通英法文語，願任國英法數理補習敎員或公司機關相當職務，通訊處辣斐德路二三九弄二十四號。　某君，浙江籍，年二十六歲，大學程度，精通商業各科，尤長會計，曾歷任中小學敎師曁銀行公司等會計員有年，現願任上開各項職務，薪金不計，並備有妥實舖保，如各界（本外埠均可）需用是項人才者，請通訊上海學院路洽升弄三號鈞轉。　徐君，年十八，上海人，高小肆業，願任機關公司行家練習生或送信員，能乘脚踏車，如欲需要此項人材者，請函寄滬東楊樹浦路新康里五十四號興幅君轉。　　鮑女士，粤籍，現年二十歲，畢業中學，曾任家庭敎師及書記等職，現願任上項職業或機關職員，月薪三十元左右，如合意者請函極司非而路地豐路二十一號。　鄭君，粤籍，現年二十六歲，畢業大學，曾任敎員及繙譯員，現願任各機關職員，月薪五十元左右，如有意者請投函極司非而路地豐路二十一號。小說節母坊（十一）  凌鶴　　「噢？」母親十分驚訝着：「有這樣的事麽？自已家的太婆的牌坊也敲碎，這還得了？你爲什麽不早來告訴我？我要打他一次的。　「這也要打他？你知道又不是他敲的，他不過是也想要那上面的菩薩頭罷了。小孩子都是如此的。」　「那末你以爲他這樣做得很對，是不是？」　「哎，我並不是這個意思，不過我以爲你就打他也是沒有用的，他那末小，懂得什麽呢？」　「那末人總得從小時候敎好的。」灰雞婆覺得沒有什麽好說，反正時敏這一次總是免不了的，所以便氣忿忿的跑開了。母親望着他走出了大門，再回轉頭來看着睡在身旁的兒子。他的嘴唇上聚滿了汗珠，掩不住的夢中的笑容；一想到醒轉來便要打他一次，立刻覺得心頭一陣隠痛。需想我不打她了麽？不，小孩子總是要打的，所謂之不打黃荆敎不成。打總是要打的，輕輕的打幾下屁股也就够了。不過她記得有一次曾經打得他臉上足足有四條殷紅的指印，一直到現在還够使她心痛。但是這一次她無論如何也不能饒過他的，不管他年紀小不懂事，然而毁壞自已家節母的牌坊，到底是不可饒怒的事。　關於這一牌坊，她知道得非常淸楚。雖然她沒有看見過自已家裏的節母是怎麽一個模樣，可是從自已的丈夫嘴裏，她是很知道節母之一生的。　遠在五十年以前，時敏的祖父大槪還是十二三歲吧。曾祖父的死，已經是十年以前的事了。節母不會忘懷丈夫臨終的遺囑。到祖父七歲的時候，便請了他的族叔來敎他讀書。　當時的房子很大，節母住在後進，留着前進給族叔帶着兒子讀書。那通前進的門，是終年關閉着的。節母和族叔一年頭不會見面一次，而且她和他也沒有見面的理由。她深深的懂得，對死丈夫表示貞操的寡婦是應該如此的。一年又一年的過去。在深夜的時候，她静對着那黃豆大的燈火，聽着表叔在敎兒子讀書的聲音，覺得手中在縫着的兒子的鞋子，每一針穿過去，都有很大的意思。不過表叔那明朗而年靑的讀書聲，却使她覺着又是親切又是難堪。這種心情，是那次在花園中偶然的看見族叔一面以後，每每想到他的時候，便不由的覺得臉上熱烘烘的，甚至於心跳起來。她每次都極力遏制這種念頭，似乎丈夫的面貎就顯在她的面前，這是非常可怕的。就是這樣，每每終夜的幻想着，直聽到老雄雞在喊破那寂寞的淸晨。</p>

<h3>Through Train to Shenyang to Begin Operations</h3>
<h3>The Organizing Body for the Through Train Service to Shenyang is Established, Named the "Oriental Travel Agency," with Organization Methods Fully Agreed Upon; Procedures for Commencing Service to be Handled According to Resolutions of the Dalian Conference</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 11:00 PM on the 24th, a secret meeting regarding the through train service was held at the official residence of Mr. Ning, north of Haihe Road, and adjourned at about 2:00 AM this morning. This morning at 9:00 AM, Chayama departed from Tianjin to return to Beiping. All preparations for the through train service are complete, awaiting implementation on July 1st. On that day, a passenger train will depart simultaneously from Shenyang and Beiping. The timetable has been internally agreed upon. Attendees at the meeting on the 24th included Yin Tong, Chief of the General Affairs Department Xu Ji, Chief of the Mechanical Affairs Department Chen Qingwen, Chief of the Accounting Department Wang Xuan, and Transportation Section Chief Bao Xuefan from the Beining Railway; Chayama and Director Suzuki of the Tianjin International Tourist Bureau from the Japanese side; and Manager Chen Xiangtao, Deputy Manager Zhou Shizhong, Cai Pingjiu, and Hu Shiyuan from the China Travel Service. All discussions at the meeting on the 24th were based on the resolutions made in Dalian by Yin Tong, Chayama, President Suzuki of the Japanese International Tourist Bureau, and Manager Saito of the Dalian International Tourist Bureau, with no new resolutions produced. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The name of the organization handling the through train service has been confirmed as the "Oriental Travel Agency." The head office will be located in Yuguan, with branch offices in Shenyang, Jinzhou, Beiping, and Tianjin. Ticket offices will be established in Tangshan, Luanxian, and major stations. Chen Xiangtao will be the manager, with two departments under him: Transportation and Accounting, each with two Chinese and Japanese section chiefs. All accounting books and tickets will be completely independent and managed by the agency itself, similar to the International Sleeping Car Company's management of sleeping cars on various routes. The order inspectors and conductors on the train will be seconded from both the Beining Railway and the South Manchuria Railway. Each train will have personnel from the Oriental Travel Agency accompanying to inspect tickets. Twenty carriages have already been manufactured and are stored in the Tangshan Locomotive Factory. The carriages are silver-gray, separated by red, yellow, and blue colors to distinguish first, second, and third class. The locomotives are also dark gray, with the words "Beiping-Shenyang Train" written on the carriages. They are more luxurious and cleaner than the current Beining Railway trains. On the 23rd and 24th,</p>
<p>several trial runs were conducted in the factory, with excellent results. The train will be driven to Beiping on the 31st, and service will commence on July 1st. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 11:00 AM on the 25th, Yin Tong, in the Beining Garden Technical Committee, invited Chen Xiangtao, Zhou Shizhong, Hu Zeyuan, Cai Pingjiu, and others to further discuss procedures for through train ticketing and inspection. The meeting adjourned at noon, and Yin hosted a casual lunch in the garden. At 2:00 PM on the 25th, Yin Tong summoned important officials such as Deputy Director Xu Wenguo, Zheng Baozhao, Chief of the Mechanical Affairs Department Chen Qingwen, and Chief of the General Affairs Department Xu Ji, to a meeting in the Beining Garden Grand Auditorium. Yin assigned each department the responsibilities for preparing for the through train service. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. This afternoon at 2:00 PM, Nitta, the representative of the South Manchuria Railway's Tianjin Office, contacted the Railway Bureau regarding a certain matter related to the through train service.

<p>(Beiping) Chayama went to Tianjin yesterday to attend the technical conference on the Beiping-Shenyang through train service. After the meeting, he returned to Beiping this afternoon and went back to the Japanese Embassy to rest. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chayama stated, "Although I met with Yin Tong, Chen Xiangtao, and others in Tianjin, there was no so-called conference. All principles and details regarding the through train service</p>
<p>have been decided. There is no need to hold further meetings. The date and plan for the commencement of service have been agreed upon, but it is not yet time for an announcement. I will inform you when it is convenient. The issue of the newly formed security force entering the war zone has not yet been agreed upon. The fundamental problem currently lies in organization, not in numbers. Because Zhao Lei, Liu Zuozhou, and Wei Yonghe's units are currently acting independently, without coordination, it is necessary to unify command. From now on, besides those who are recalled, any shortfall in numbers will be supplemented by the new security force." According to his intentions, he still insists on 6,000 men, combined with Zhao Lei's and other units to form a total of 9,000. Regarding this issue, Yu Xuezhong agreed to consider it further, and the two sides will continue discussions. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday afternoon, Yin Tong invited China Travel Service Manager Chen Xiangtao, Assistant Manager Hu Shiyuan, Chief of the Transportation Department Chen Qingwen, Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Chayama, International Tourist Bureau Director Suzuki, South Manchuria Railway Representative Kogu, and Tianjin Branch Manager Qingchao to the final technical cooperation meeting on the through train service at the Beining Hotel. It was decided that the China Travel Service and the Japanese International Tourist Bureau would organize the Beiping-Liaoning Travel Agency. The organizational regulations and operating rules were discussed and decided upon by both parties. The contract is ready to be signed, and the agreed items have been sent to the Beining Railway Bureau for printing, in preparation for simultaneous announcement on the 28th. Two train sets manufactured by the Tangshan Factory were recently test-run between Tangshan and Luanxian. One train set arrived at the Fengtai Locomotive Factory at 3:00 AM this morning, awaiting dispatch. The locomotive is number 188, and the passenger cars total ten. The entire train is gray. The color of the rolling stock prepared by the South Manchuria Railway is also the same. It is said that eleven cars per set have been transferred to Shenyang Station, including an observation car. The list of fourteen train conductors for the Guannei section has been announced by the Beining Railway's Transportation Department. The uniform is all white with red trouser seams. The style and color of passenger tickets have been determined and printed. Each ticket is divided into approximately five sections: one to be sold to the passenger, one to be kept by the Beiping-Liaoning Travel Agency, one to be kept by the sales outlet, one to be kept by the Beining or South Manchuria Railway Bureau, and one to be given to the luggage room. One section of the passenger's ticket is further divided into two parts. When passing through Yuguan, half is collected by the travel agency, and the remaining half is returned to the head office by the travel agency branch at the train's destination. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An official of a certain authority stated that the Japanese side's desire for the Beiping-Shenyang through train service dates back to more than a year ago. Our country was concerned about the suspicion of recognizing the puppet state. In addition, the Fujian incident occurred, and the Communist bandits in Jiangxi had not been eliminated, so there was no time to discuss it, and it was repeatedly delayed. Now, because the other side's demands are more urgent, and the central government is taking into account the compatriots outside the pass and the convenience of transportation within the pass, it has decided to conduct negotiations under the principle of not recognizing the puppet state. Currently, this matter is being handled by our country's commercial organization, the China Travel Service, and the Japanese commercial organization, the Tourist Bureau, together with the Beining Railway Bureau and the South Manchuria Railway, to discuss various technical procedures for the through train service. It can be resolved within a few days. A travel agency will be jointly established by the China Travel Service and the Japanese Tourist Bureau to be responsible for handling the through train service. In short, the Beiping-Shenyang through train service is no longer a problem. It is still difficult to determine whether the procedures will be implemented on July 1st. As for abolishing the Tanggu Truce Agreement after the commencement of the through train service, it is possible in fact, because our side has gradually taken over the war zone, local order has also been restored, and the obligations of the agreement have been fulfilled, so it will be abolished in effect even if it is not formally abolished. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Minzu News Agency, the through train plan will be announced in Beiping at 9:00 AM on the 28th. The detailed rules for the commencement of service have also been printed in more than 500 copies and will be announced simultaneously with the plan. At that time, Yin Tong will also issue a declaration or statement, explaining the process of the through train service negotiations. (25th)</p>

<h3>Optimistic Prospects for Xinjiang: Peng Zhaoxian's Remarks After Arriving in Beiping</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Peng Zhaoxian, Director of the Xinjiang Civil Affairs Department, arrived in Beiping this morning by Beiping-Baotou train after arriving in Suiyuan by Xinsui bus. According to him, he was ordered to inspect Xinjiang this time and felt that the land was vast and sparsely populated, and that immigration to populate the borders was essential. However, Xinjiang's finances are depleted, its currency system is chaotic, and Soviet Russian economic power has deeply penetrated Xinjiang. Therefore, developing Xinjiang's transportation and rescuing Xinjiang's finances are also imperative. Ma Zhongying is confined in Sacher seeking to surrender. The future of Xinjiang is optimistic. All ethnic groups realize that they cannot survive without unity. I will not stay in Beiping for long and will pay a visit to He before scheduling a trip to Beijing. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Central and National Government Memorial Weeks Report by Ju Zheng; Journey North</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held its 136th Memorial Week at 8:00 AM on the 25th, attended by Ju Zheng, Liu Shouzhong, Deng Jiayan, Li Ciwen, Gu Zhenggang, Li Zonghuang, Wang Qi, Xie Zuomin, Hong Ludong, and staff members, totaling 600 people. Ju Zheng presided and gave a report, stating that he was dispatched to the north and traveled through Jiangxi, Hubei, Hebei, Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Qufu, and other places, and had good impressions. Firstly, in general terms, the Party and government and construction in various places have made obvious progress, and the responsible persons in various aspects are able to strive to embrace the necessity of unity. However, agriculture, industry, and commerce are declining everywhere, and the government urgently needs to find ways to provide relief. Secondly, separately speaking, in the northern districts of Jiangxi Province, only three or four counties remain uncleared, and it will not be difficult to recover them in the short term. Order in Wuhan has greatly improved, especially the police have handled it very well. Military and political leaders in Beiping have maintained治安 with significant results. The public has made good criticisms of our party. The environment in Tianjin is very bad, but fortunately, the comrades in the Party department have worked hard, so the results are very good. Lu Han has worked hard to govern, and the politics and order of the entire province are very organized and solemn. The meeting adjourned at 9:00 AM. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>

President Ju presided and, after leading the ceremony, gave a report on "Towards the Road to Construction," stating briefly, "I started this time to inspect the Party affairs in North China. The impressions along the way were good. Although the situation in North China is special,</p>
<p>as long as the government and the people work together to carry out construction work, the national crisis can be saved. When I set off, I followed the waterway, passing through Anhui and Jiangxi to reach Hubei, and then took a car to Beiping, passing through the most convenient places for transportation. The journey took only one week. I passed through seven or eight provinces. Because I used modern boats and cars, I was so fast. From this, I feel that China's material construction is really urgent. Our country's territory has an area of 4.3 million square miles, but there are only 5,800 miles of railways. How inconvenient is this in terms of transportation? As for the waterways, although they are rich rivers, they cannot be used for irrigation, and floods cause floods, which proves the lack of economic facilities in China. Under the economic and military aggression of the powers, our country can only rely on the progress of transportation to eliminate material obstacles and strengthen national unity. Therefore, active construction has become the only way out for our country at present. I hope everyone will work together to move forward." (Central News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>

Xiao Focheng, Deng Zhiru, Tang Shaoyi, and other elders are also holding meetings to discuss and still adhere to their previous political views. The outside world has made many speculations about the results of the meetings. Some say that the southwestern provinces will be able to firmly unite to resist foreign aggression, and others believe that the generals have come here to negotiate a plan with the leaders of Guangdong Province to make the cooperation between the central government and the southwest a reality.

<h3>Current Affairs: Discussion on the Establishment of Circuit Supervisory Envoys</h3>
<p>In our country, in recent decades, incidents of moral degradation and loss of integrity have emerged endlessly. Corruption in officialdom, in particular, is deeply resented by the common people. However, the common people, intimidated by temporary tyrannical power, often swallow their anger and dare not resist corrupt officials. The reason for guiding the people to chaos lies in the abundance of officials who harm the people and the scarcity of officials who govern officials. Recently, due to the changing times, there is a growing sense of decline, which is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>Some speakers often refer to the darkness of official governance during the late Qing dynasty. However, they do not realize that the officials who governed officials in the Qing dynasty were still able to fulfill their duties. At that time, under the prevailing Censorate system, there was still the so-called Court of Censors, whose mission was to rectify the legal system and moral order. All gains and losses in political affairs, the integrity and corruption of officials, and significant matters concerning the national economy and the people's livelihood, could be directly impeached without any hesitation. The fifteen Supervising Censors under its jurisdiction separately investigated criminal and civil affairs in the capital region and fourteen important provinces. Each Censor had the power to impeach. The scope of impeachment, in terms of issues, ranged from officials engaging in personal gain and violating the law to moral failings. In terms of people, it encompassed everyone from ordinary officials to princes and high-ranking dignitaries, with no exceptions. The inherent value of the Censorate system cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Today's supervision originates from the Censor system of the past. Since the establishment of the National Government's Control Yuan in the 20th year of the Republic, it has always been its responsibility to uncover hidden wrongdoings and impeach misconduct. In particular, the dispatch of personnel to investigate various levies, disaster relief, and embankment projects in various provinces has won the hearts of the people. However, since the revolution, the independent exercise of supervisory power has been a pioneering endeavor. Sometimes, it is because the disciplinary agencies cannot be centralized, or because the supervisory powers are still awaiting expansion. In administrative matters, obstacles inevitably arise, which cannot be denied. What is gratifying is that the Control Commissioners are unwilling to remain complacent. Among their improvement plans, the establishment of circuit supervisory envoys in various districts is particularly noteworthy. The purpose of this measure is to give the people the opportunity to file lawsuits against corruption locally, and to provide the government with a clear understanding of the people's sentiments. This is an urgent matter that needs no further explanation. Since the Executive Yuan passed the regulations for special envoys to inspect local areas in early April of this year, the various Control Commissioners, believing that this conflicted with the authority of the circuit supervisory envoys, have resolved to organize circuit supervisory envoy offices in each province as soon as possible, starting with Jiangsu and Hebei provinces. This matter is permitted by the Organic Law of the Control Yuan. Once funding is secured, it can be quickly established.</p>
<p>According to the explanation of the Control Yuan's district division plan, the country is divided into fourteen districts. A circuit supervisory envoy will be specially dispatched to each district to exercise the power of impeachment. The intention is roughly based on the old system of the fifteen Supervising Censors of the Qing dynasty. The difference is that the Qing dynasty Supervising Censors were stationed in the capital and only went out on assignments such as salt inspection, grain transport inspection, and granary inspection. Comparing today's district division plan with the ancient system, the closest resemblance is the "Ten Circuits Patrol" system of the Tang dynasty. The benefits of this system, as stated at the time, were to enable the patrolling personnel to "personally visit subordinate counties, or enter villages and neighborhoods to supervise wrongdoing and observe customs." Today, the suffering of the people is far greater than in the Tang dynasty. Given the vastness of our country, the alienation of the people's sentiments, and the deep-rooted malpractices in various localities, the establishment of district supervisory envoy offices to compensate for the inadequacy of the Control Commissioners' itinerant inspections is certainly something we can all support. However, there are still concerns regarding three issues: the scope of the powers of the circuit supervisory envoys, the selection of personnel for the circuit supervisory envoys, and the punishment of local military personnel.</p>
<p>(1) Article 3 of the Organic Law of the Control Yuan states that "Circuit supervisory envoys shall go to each supervisory district to exercise the power of impeachment." There is no doubt that the scope of their power is limited to impeachment. Compared to the Qing dynasty Censors, who had the power to advise on political affairs, supervise administration, examine officials, jointly try important cases, inspect accounting, and cancel case files, they are not on the same level. If we want to expand the power of the circuit supervisory envoys, we must first expand the power of the entire Control Yuan. The Control Yuan has already expressed its opinions on the initial draft of the constitution, and we also express our sympathy. However, it is impossible to predict whether the draft constitution will adopt its intentions. Even if it is adopted, we do not know when it will be implemented. Therefore, patching up the loopholes depends on the efforts of the Control Commissioners to make suggestions, and the central authorities' willingness to approve them. Otherwise, if there is the power of impeachment but not the power to supervise administration and examine officials, and the disciplinary agencies are still not unified and centralized, then the impeachment system is practically useless. Even if each circuit supervisory envoy is intelligent and capable, without the power to implement their impeachment intentions, they will ultimately return with disappointment.</p>
<p>Considering the original intention of establishing the Supervisory Envoy Offices, isn't this contradictory?</p>
<p>(2) The selection of Censors in our country throughout history has generally emphasized experience and ability, while newly promoted scholars have been excluded. This is because newly promoted scholars often seek reputation through impeachment, even falsely accusing virtuous and good people. They deliberately sought faults and used personal connections as henchmen. As time went by, the evils of factionalism emerged. Officials governing officials were not qualified to govern themselves, and this accelerated the deterioration of general official governance. This cannot be allowed to continue. The Organic Law of the Control Yuan stipulates that Control Commissioners may concurrently serve as Supervisory Envoys, but it does not state that non-Control Commissioners may not serve as Supervisory Envoys. What will be the basis for selecting personnel to be assigned as Supervisory Envoys in the future? This must be carefully considered. Only by referring to the ancient system can the drawbacks be reduced. (3) The people of our country have long suffered from military affairs. The common people in the interior suffer even more from the oppression of military commanders, with no one to whom they can complain. Under the current system, the powers of impeachment and discipline are already separated, and the review of military commanders handed over for discipline is controlled by the highest central military organ. In the future, after the establishment of Circuit Supervisory Envoys, in the event of such impeachment cases, regardless of repeated appeals and time wasted, the outcome is not entirely predictable. There is also the great question of whether the Circuit Supervisory Envoys can escape the control of local military forces and freely exercise their power of impeachment. The original intention of the common people in appealing to the Supervisory Envoy Offices is to seek redress. If they risk lodging complaints with those who cannot protect them, only to hasten their own demise, then it is better to remain silent. The Control Commissioners know that this path is impassable, yet they persist in pursuing it. Their perseverance is commendable, but what about their inability to achieve their goals? This is the main key to the success or failure of the Circuit Supervisory Envoy system in the future, and it cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>The National Government Officially Abolishes Six Illegal Taxes and Strictly Prohibits Re-imposing Any Taxes</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 25th stating that "The people are the foundation of the nation, and when the foundation is firm, the nation is secure." Since ancient times, governance has always placed the relief of the people as the top priority. There has never been a case where the strength of the people is exhausted and the country can avoid danger. The historical record is clear and should serve as a warning. In recent years, due to numerous domestic troubles, frequent internal conflicts, rampant corvée labor, and heavy levies, the old and weak are left to die in ditches, and the strong become bandits. The people have lost their will to live, and the entire country has fallen into a state of chaos. If this continues, how can the country endure? It is imperative to rectify the situation quickly in order to alleviate the people's suffering and stabilize the country. The Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the order, convened a national financial conference and resolved to abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies. It defined the scope of illegal taxes into six categories: (1) those that harm social public interests; (2) those that harm the source of central revenue; (3) double taxation; (4) those that hinder transportation; (5) those that benefit one locality but impose unfair taxes on imports from other localities; and (6) local goods transit taxes. It also agreed on four reform measures: (1) For legal taxes collected by various provinces and cities that began before November 17th of the Republic, when the National Government announced the national and local revenue and expenditure division standards, a list of the tax names, uses, tax rates, collection amounts, and collection dates should be reported to the Ministry of Finance as a special case. (2) For legal taxes collected by various provinces and cities based on current laws or regulations that began after the National Government announced the national and local revenue and expenditure division standards, a list of the tax names, uses, tax rates, collection amounts, and collection dates should be reported to the Ministry of Finance as a special case and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for review. (3) When taxes collected by various provinces and cities or increases or decreases in tax items conflict with the provisions of laws or regulations, the Ministry of Finance may stop or cancel them at any time. (4) The aforementioned six categories of illegal taxes should be abolished in stages from July 1st to December 31st of the 23rd year of the Republic. How to compensate for this will be determined in a separate case. If various provinces and cities have special circumstances and are unable to abolish them completely within the time limit, they may submit a special report to the Ministry of Finance for review. The above four measures are crucial for alleviating the people's suffering and are essential. The provincial and municipal governments should instruct their subordinates to comply with them in order to fulfill the central government's intention to eliminate abuses and benefit the people. This order also states that the unified tax system was originally established to standardize the tax system and facilitate commerce. All goods subject to the unified tax, such as cigarettes, cured tobacco, cotton yarn, matches, cement, wheat flour, beer, and factory-levied tobacco and alcohol, have been newly regulated in the collection regulations. After one tax is collected at the customs, factory, or place of origin, they are allowed to circulate throughout the country and no other taxes may be levied. The Ministry of Finance has notified the provincial and municipal governments and made a public announcement. The provincial and municipal governments should comply with the central government's laws and regulations and strictly implement them. However, according to the Executive Yuan, some provinces and cities have recently been imposing taxes on goods under the pretext of local needs, which disrupts the national tax system and increases the burden on merchants and the people, which is detrimental to both the country and the people. The provincial and municipal governments should strictly instruct their subordinates that in the future, they must not re-impose any taxes on goods under the pretext of local needs. Those that are currently being collected should be ordered to stop immediately. If they still follow the old ways and illegally re-impose taxes, they should be severely punished to uphold the law and relieve merchants' hardships. This order." (Central News Agency, 25th)</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Department of Finance Abolishes Excessive and Miscellaneous Taxes</h3>

As for the stamp tax, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that one-tenth will go to the province, three-tenths to the county, two-tenths to assist remote provinces, and the remaining four-tenths to the Ministry.

<h3>Japan Seeks to Improve Relations with the U.S., but the U.S. Authorities Remain Noncommittal; Saito Repeatedly Probes Before Returning Home, Hoping to Offer Concrete and Feasible Solutions</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press learned today that Japan recently sounded out U.S. officials regarding Japan's suggestions for improving Japan-U.S. relations. Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Saito, who is leaving the U.S. on Tuesday to return home, will take advantage of this summer recess to discuss plans with Japanese government authorities to promote friendly relations between Japan and the U.S. Saito has held several meetings with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull. President Roosevelt and Secretary Hull received Saito several times last month. Saito probed President Roosevelt and Secretary Hull's reactions to Japan's suggestions, which are as follows: (1) Conclude a Japan-U.S. non-aggression pact; (2) Based on commercial understanding, issue a declaration of mutual amity and non-competition; (3) Begin negotiations on the status of "Manchukuo," the independence of the Philippines, Sino-Japanese relations which hinder Japan-U.S. relations, and other issues. It is understood that Saito believes that if political issues between Japan and the U.S. can be resolved satisfactorily, the naval competition crisis can be easily resolved. However, according to what the Associated Press has learned, the U.S. government authorities, aside from listening to these exploratory plans, have neither expressed approval or disapproval nor proposed counter-proposals. According to reliable sources, the U.S. government authorities believe that Japan must propose concrete and feasible proposals before the U.S. can give them serious consideration. It is further understood that any suggestions Japan makes to Washington must also be acceptable to all countries concerned in the Far East. (National Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Calls for Postponement of Naval Conference</h3>
<p>(Washington) The former president of the U.S. Naval League, Harbus, told Associated Press reporters today that he strongly advocated an indefinite adjournment of the 1935 naval disarmament conference. Harbus stated that the naval conference not only has no practical achievements but may also endanger world peace and practical disarmament. The current political and economic situation is not conducive to convening the 1935 naval conference. Except for the United States, the world's naval powers are increasing their naval strength rather than decreasing it. For the sake of world peace and the future naval disarmament conference, it is hoped that the preliminary talks currently underway in London can develop a situation that allows all countries to agree to suspend the 1935 naval conference pending an appropriate time, but all countries must maintain the status quo stipulated by the Washington and London treaties. At this point in his talk, Harbus then put forward various reasons to prove that the London talks would not achieve anything, such as Japan's demand for naval equality, Britain's request to build 22 more cruisers, and the actual construction of battleships and battlecruisers by France and Italy as three major reasons affecting practical disarmament. Harbus also called the world's attention to the French and Italian proposal to invite Russia and Germany to participate in the naval conference. Harbus stated that this move would only increase the difficulty. Harbus has presided over the Naval League for a long time, and the League is very influential. Mr. Harbus is also regarded as an authority on naval issues, so his remarks this time may attract the close attention of various countries. The idea of postponing the naval conference was already heard last week, and diplomats have been considering the matter. (National Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Views of the Japanese Naval Department</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese naval authorities are currently unwilling to make official comments criticizing British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell's speech on naval expansion. However, according to the views of a certain naval expert, the British First Lord's speech can prove that the general European disarmament negotiations cannot be concluded satisfactorily, and that disagreements between Britain and the United States have led to Britain being threatened. The conflict between Britain and the United States on naval strength is due to Britain's informal request to reduce the size of U.S. 10,000-ton cruisers, but the U.S. government rejected its request. Since then, Britain's enthusiasm for expanding armaments has been increasing day by day, changing the original plan to build four 6,000-ton cruisers to three 9,000-ton cruisers and one 5,000-ton cruiser. Furthermore, the fundamental difference between Britain's majority of small ships and the United States' minority of large ships is also one of the reasons for the Anglo-American dispute. Looking at the mainland, France began construction last year on a 16,500-ton fast battleship, and its strength in other submarines, air forces, etc. is also quite superior. Italy's 35,000-ton shipbuilding plan is proceeding steadily. It is not known how the British First Lord's speech will affect the naval preparatory negotiations, which is most noteworthy.

<h3>Japanese Anti-Russian Activities</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Japanese Asahi Shimbun published news (later reprinted by other Japanese newspapers) stating that during the trial of the arrested leaders of the Soviet Friendship Society, it was proven that a certain employee of the Soviet Embassy in Japan had assisted the Japanese communist movement, etc. Izvestia commented on this, "The purpose of this latest anti-Soviet movement in Japanese newspapers is to worsen Soviet-Japanese relations. Although the contradiction does not require further comment, it is already as clear as pointing to one's palm. The reason why we must discuss these fabrications is only because this rumor was reported by a newspaper as serious as the Asahi Shimbun, and was also confirmed by an official representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>This new anti-Soviet movement in the Japanese press can only be explained by their completely intentional desire to incite Japanese public opinion against the Soviet embassy and the Soviet Union. The Asahi Shimbun and representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are well aware that the Soviet Friendship Society was established in 1931, and its founders were the Japanese writer Akita, the literary critic Hase, the artist Tsuda, and other progressive figures in the artistic and scientific circles. The existence of the Society at that time was entirely legal, and it openly published the magazine "Soviet Friend," reporting impartial news about Soviet construction work. The members of the Society formed an independent group in 1932, and formed the "Japan-Soviet Cultural Association," which still exists today. However, according to the Asahi Shimbun's news, the Soviet Friendship Society was finally dissolved at the beginning of 1933.</p>
<p>"We do not yet know the details of this moving and sensational new event, but judging from the TASS telegram already published and the statements in the Japanese newspapers, these new accusations have an openly and far-reaching provocative nature. The inventors of this new movement apparently do not have a high level of invention. As for the accusation that the former head of the Information Department of the Tokyo Embassy, ​​Galkovich, supplied "certain informational materials and photographs about the Soviet Union" to the secretary of a legal group that was striving to be friendly with the Soviet Union, it is particularly laughable. These authors apparently do not understand that the responsibility of the Information Department of any embassy in any country is to disseminate accurate news about the country it represents. As for the accusation that Mr. Galkovich "assisted the Japanese communist movement," it is even more contradictory. We learn from the news of the "Japanese newspaper" that the basis of this "terrible" accusation is as follows: Mr. Galkovich ordered ten copies of the magazine published by the aforementioned group at a cost of 35 Japanese yen, and from this, it is guessed that "this sum of money was used for communist activities."</p>
<p>"Recently, reactionary Japanese militarists have revived their far-reaching anti-Soviet movement, and the aforementioned recent attack on the Soviet Union is by no means accidental, but is part of the entire plan of this movement. There is no doubt about this. Among such events, it must also be mentioned that major cinemas in Tokyo recently screened a new anti-Soviet film "Supreme Will," which aims to arouse militaristic and anti-Soviet sentiments in the audience, and openly impress upon the Japanese people the idea that they must prepare for an anti-Soviet war. The content of this film is sufficient to provide a fluent explanation for itself," the message said. (TASS Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Ukraine Moves Capital Yesterday</h3>
<p>Kyiv The Ukrainian Soviet government moved from Kharkiv to Kyiv today. Members of the Ukrainian government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party arrived here by special train. Large numbers of workers and collective farmers welcomed them at major stations along the way. When the government moved in, more than 500,000 people held a parade to show their welcome. At the same time, the Kyiv military police held a review, the message said. (TASS Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Izvestia commented on the move of the capital of Ukraine, stating that this move is a manifestation of the massive development of the Ukrainian Republic in terms of material and culture. The most adventurous fascists are willing to wager the Ukrainian issue as a desperate gamble in the international political arena, but they have not succeeded. After giving the counterrevolution a crushing defeat, Soviet Ukraine is building its socialist economy with confidence. Kharkiv has become one of the most noteworthy major cities in the Soviet Union. At present, the working masses of Ukraine are turning their attention to this relatively backward area, transforming the ancient city of Kyiv to make it the foremost fortress of material and intellectual socialist culture. The relocation of the capital of Ukraine is an impression of the consolidation of the strength of a most important Soviet republic," it said. (TASS Telegram on the 25th)</p>

At that time, all cabinet members and most of the members of the diplomatic corps stationed in Yugoslavia had been waiting on the shore. In addition, there were members of a youth sports team, wearing blue-gray uniforms and red shirts, guarding on both sides. The wharf was covered with French flags, and the crowd was crowded, singing and cheering. After Barthou landed, he took a car to the residence to rest briefly, and then went to the burial place of French soldiers who died in battle and the monument to the defense of the Yugoslav capital during the European War to lay wreaths.

<p>Belgrade French Foreign Minister Barthou disembarked here this afternoon from the Yugoslav magnificent ship Alexander. Accompanied by Foreign Minister Jevtic, he went to the Prime Minister's Office to see Prime Minister Urenovic. An interesting anecdote that can be mentioned when Mr. Barthou landed is that a team of Serbian farmers, each wearing colorful clothes, presented Mr. Barthou with a set of traditional clothing, including a pair of bottomless boots, which had to be tied with ropes to the calves when worn. Mr. Barthou accepted it, and it was quite apt. (National Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital Foreign Minister Jevtic invited Barthou to a casual drink in the evening to welcome him. At the same time, the press circles of the two countries also invited foreign journalists to dinner. After the two foreign ministers finished their dinner, they went to the press banquet to chat. Barthou said that he was deeply moved by the sincere and enthusiastic feelings of the people of the South. Jevtic said that the South's relationship with France is enduring. (Havas Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times commented on French Foreign Minister Barthou's visit to Romania and Yugoslavia, saying, "Barthou's visit to Romania was very successful. The hospitality in the Yugoslav capital for Barthou was equally enthusiastic. According to Barthou, he is a representative of the old style of diplomacy. One day, he said that the diplomatic procedures used in Geneva were unfamiliar to him. He extremely supports consolidating France's old alliances. Barthou also explicitly acknowledged the suggestion of Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov. Mr. Litvinov's advocacy is to emphasize security and de-emphasize disarmament. Barthou is exhausting his intelligence to enable France to carry out its mission again. In other words, it is to maintain the international status quo." The Times recounted Barthou's visits to Warsaw and Prague, as well as his meeting with Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss. It then concluded, "Britain has signed the Locarno Treaty, and its attitude towards international policy has already been decided. Therefore, it can only observe how this policy held by the French Foreign Minister develops. At the same time, it is hoped that the one-sided nature of Barthou's plan will not be as exaggerated as people say. In fact, the French government originally wanted Germany to participate in the work in Geneva on an equal footing, without any intention of exclusion. This can be seen from several signs," it said.

<p>Yugoslav Capital Although the weather was hot today when French Foreign Minister Barthou arrived here, there were many people welcoming him.

<h3>Hitler Party Members Continue Terrorist Activities in Austria</h3>
<p>Vienna The bombing actions of Austrian National Socialist Party terrorists continue to spread throughout the country. Recently, they have targeted the residences of church pastors. A landmine was buried in front of the residence of a pastor in the Kapfenberg district of Styria. When the pastor entered, it exploded and killed him, and several others were injured. The people of the entire city were very angry upon hearing this news. Newspapers reprinted the Italian Fascist Party's Working Newspaper's warning to Germany, proving that the bombs found many times were all made in Germany, so the terrorist incidents were actually instigated by Germany. The recent situation is particularly serious, and it is said that Germany's actions are a crime against Europe and world peace. (Havas Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Government is Gradually Becoming Dissatisfied and Losing Popular Support</h3>
<p>Propaganda Minister Refutes Slander</p>
<p>Essen Recently, Hitler's government has gradually become dissatisfied and lost popular support. For example, Vice-Chancellor Papen criticized domestic politics in a speech at the University of Marburg a few days ago. Therefore, Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave speeches in various places to refute those who criticized politics. The speech he made here today, attacking all "slanderers," was even more thorough. In his speech, he called the conservatives who were generally dissatisfied with the status quo the enemies of National Socialism, saying that those who were dissatisfied with the status quo did not belong to the workers' side, but to the officials, intellectuals, and journalists. However, the power of these people should not be overestimated, because all those with eyes will choose to judge for themselves and will never be influenced by these people. It would be a big mistake to think that we should argue with the conservatives, because we can ignore the conservatives and let the people understand our actions. When discussing the economic situation in Germany, Goebbels also did not express optimism, saying that if there is a mistake in economic measures, it will be enough to affect economic life, even after ten or twenty years. When discussing newspapers, he said that the current situation in the press is still not good. Although the newspaper law has been promulgated, I cannot invent journalists. In short, we will do everything we believe to be fair and upright with all our strength, without any scruples. In short, our ability is infinitely great, etc. (Havas News Agency Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<h3>German Aviation Craze</h3>

<h3>Anglo-German Debt Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Berlin) At the request of the British government, Germany will send experts to London tomorrow to discuss the Young and Dawes loan issues. As for who the financial experts being sent are, it is currently kept very secret. It is believed that the government delegation must include the president of the German National Bank, Schacht, and Finance Minister Krosigk. This delegation does not represent private bankers, because they are not related to the aforementioned two types of loans. It is understood that this Anglo-German conference is the result of the German National Bank's announcement of a six-month suspension of debt payments and the British Lower House's proposal to establish an Anglo-German clearing house, as well as the British government's approval of restrictions on German imports. (Reuters Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German delegation will soon fly to London to begin negotiations with the British authorities on the method of transferring debt. The newspapers here unanimously welcome this, but at the same time claim that Germany is afraid that it will be difficult to make any concessions in the current period, and that the German delegation's trip is only to state Germany's position so that the world can understand it. Furthermore, if the German delegation can arrive in London tomorrow, it will be very coincidental, because tomorrow there will be a fierce debate in the British House of Commons on the "retaliatory measures" caused by Germany's declaration of suspension of debt payments. According to the opinion published by the Press Association here, although the British Parliament has a trend to urgently pass the so-called retaliatory measures proposal and intends to pass the third reading on Tuesday as planned, this does not mean that the problem cannot be handled amicably. (National Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(London) German Chancellor Hitler made a statement when he met with the diplomatic correspondent of the London News Chronicle, explaining the attitude Germany should adopt towards the foreign boycott of German goods, and explaining the future prospects of the National Socialist Party movement, but he refused to comment on German foreign policy and his feelings about the League of Nations. He said, "Germany's isolation is the thing I least want to hear, but although Germany's export industry is encountering difficulties, the German spirit will not be discouraged by this. During the Great War, Germany could not import many goods, but Germany was able to manufacture them itself. Now, if necessary, Germany can still follow the story of the European War and re-encourage the spirit of that year, and its success will be greater than ever before. If the boycott of German goods by various countries continues unabated, we will also be forced to adopt a retaliatory policy. At that time, we can also order throughout Germany, for example, to stop buying American goods, so that even the slightest bit of money will not be allowed to cross the red line of the German border. Under such circumstances, the world will almost understand the true impact of adopting a boycott policy against German goods. As for the activities of the National Socialist Party, they are neither right-leaning nor left-leaning. This activity should continue to move forward bravely, and its lifespan can last for thousands of years without defeat. Today, the German people follow me, and their ranks are more dense than a year ago. Wherever I go, the people follow me. It is like this today, and it will be like this in the future. We are definitely not cowards. When difficulties are in front of us, we will not succumb to them. We will become stronger the more we fight. I still remember fifteen years ago, I declared that I would eventually rule Germany one day. Everyone who heard it ridiculed me as being outrageous. You can probably remember this situation. Today, I declare that I will hold power for a long time, and there are also those who hear it and laugh secretly. As I see it, those who laugh at me today are all unconscious, just like those who mocked me for being crazy before." (Havas Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Philippine Provisional Constitution Based on American Doctrine</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Philippine Constitution of Independence, which is anticipated by 14 million people, will definitely incorporate the principles of the American side. The 202 constituent representatives will hold a constitutional convention in Manila on July 4, but most of their work has been completed in advance. The constitution-makers may debate the form of a ten-year valid provisional constitution, because the essence of the constitution was decided in Washington when the Tydings-McDuffie Act was passed. There are two important provisions in the constitution, namely, that the Philippines must adopt a republican government and must contain a declaration of civil rights, which are entirely American doctrines. Before the United States abandons its sovereignty in the Philippines, the constitution should contain the following provisions: (1) The citizens of the Philippines should be loyal to the United States; (2) The officials of the Philippine Republic should recognize the supreme power of the United States; (3) Freedom of religion should be explicitly stipulated; (4) The property of the United States and the Church is exempt from taxation; (5) The commercial relations between the Philippines and the United States should be consistent with the restrictions in the Tydings-McDuffie Act; (6) Maintain public debt; (7) The new government should assume and repay all the debts of the current government; (8) Maintain the school system and teach English; (9) Laws on finance, coinage, import and export commerce, and immigration should be approved by the U.S. President; (10) Foreign affairs should be managed by the United States; (11) The Philippine Congress should report the laws it passes to the U.S. Congress; (12) The Philippines acknowledges that the United States has the right to dispose of property for public use, maintain the army, and the U.S. President may order the mobilization of all troops organized by the Philippine government; (13) Court judgments should be submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court for review; (14) The United States may intervene to protect life or maintain the government and its obligations.

<h3>Disarmament and Security; Advocates that Countries Conclude Bilateral Agreements</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Special Committee on Security Issues of the Disarmament Conference has recently passed the report submitted by the committee's chairman, Politis, advocating that countries conclude bilateral security agreements separately. A total of 28 countries are represented on the Security Committee, of which 26 countries voted in favor, but Italy and Hungary abstained from voting. Although Britain voted in favor, it submitted two reservations, namely: (1) In addition to the obligations stipulated in the Locarno Agreement, the United States cannot bear new obligations regarding security; (2) Britain reserves the right not to recognize the "definition of aggressor." The so-called "definition of aggressor" refers to the "definition of aggressor" stipulated in the non-aggression pact signed in London last July by the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Estonia, Latvia, Persia, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Lithuania, and Czechoslovakia.

<h3>Riots in Various Parts of France</h3>
<p>(Paris) - Riots have broken out in various parts of France at the end of this week, with hundreds injured. The tense atmosphere between the French Fascists and anti-Fascists is evident. The most violent conflict occurred in the Lorraine region, where more than two thousand rioters attacked mounted police. The police were ordered to disperse them, but the rioters seized bottles and chairs from cafes, and picked up bricks and stones from the street to hurl at the police. A melee ensued, and the police called for firemen to assist. However, the rioters also attacked the firemen, tearing their belts and destroying them. A veterans' association was holding a meeting when the crowd stormed in, attacking people and smashing the camera at the venue. The authorities dispatched police reinforcements, who charged several times, resulting in hundreds of injuries on both sides. The rioters eventually dispersed, and many were arrested, including an important labor union member who seized an injured police chief's baton and used it to direct the rioters. One policeman had an eye gouged out, and twenty others were seriously injured. All the injured have been taken to the hospital.</p>

<h3>American Ambassador to Moscow Nearly Crushed to Death by Plane</h3>
<p>(Moscow) - The American Ambassador to Russia, Bullitt, nearly died this afternoon when his private plane was forced to land and overturned. Mr. Bullitt, accompanied by his American driver, Mr. White, was flying to Leningrad to see his sixteen-year-old daughter.

White managed to land the plane in a swamp, and the fuselage suddenly overturned upon landing. Although the plane was destroyed, the American Ambassador and the driver were pulled out from under the fuselage, and both were unharmed. This plane was the American Ambassador's private plane, which he used to travel around Russia. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<h3>US to Issue Silver Certificates</h3>
<p>(London) - According to a Washington dispatch from the New York Times, responsible parties claim that the value of the silver certificates the US Treasury Department intends to issue will only be equal to the purchase price of the silver purchased by the Treasury. This method will be used at least for the time being. The Treasury has the right to issue silver certificates with a value equal to the legal price of silver at $1.29 per ounce. The fact that the Treasury does not want to exercise this right shows that the authorities are eager to avoid any action that could cause the public to lose confidence in American currency, so that the basic procedures of national recovery will not encounter unfavorable reactions. It is widely believed that since the implementation of the new policy, the authorities have purchased 100 million ounces of silver at a cost of $50 million, which was allocated from the $200 million exchange stabilization fund. It is said that the number of purchases will gradually increase until another 100 million ounces have been purchased. However, the Treasury will adjust its purchases to ensure that the price of silver does not rise rapidly. If speculative price increases occur in the silver market, the Treasury will stop purchasing silver until the price returns to a more favorable level. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Figures' Condemnation of the Current Situation in Manchukuo Exposes the Various Evils of the Japanese in Manchukuo: The Opium Policy, the Maladministration of Armed Immigration, and the Proliferation of Japanese Bandits and Chinese Bandits in Manchuria</h3>
<p>The "China Press" Tokyo dispatch of June 20th reports: "Criticism of the Japanese's evil policies in Manchukuo has been increasingly heard here. It is said that the people in many parts of Manchukuo are now on the verge of terror. Tens of thousands of hardworking farmers and small-scale businessmen are now turning into bandits to escape intolerable ill-treatment. What is even more shocking is that such criticisms do not come from resentful Chinese or anti-Japanese propagandists. If they were the exaggerations of such people, they would certainly not exist here. All of this is the conclusion of high-ranking Japanese army officers who have investigated the current situation in Manchukuo. Today, only these people can be expected to criticize Manchukuo, and they are also the first to be angered by any disparaging remarks. The only people who can speak frankly and without reservation today are members of the army. They are now the first to identify the poor state of Manchukuo, and they do not show any leniency to their comrades who govern Manchukuo."</p>
<p>"Most of these criticisms come from high-ranking army officers who have recently returned from inspecting Manchukuo. Their published opinions prove two things: (1) That liberalism is now spreading in the army, and that moderate and broad-minded elements are gradually gaining the upper hand. A year ago, no one in an important position dared to criticize Manchukuo, let alone army figures. Public opinion would not have allowed it. Even today, civilians are still very cautious when writing about Manchukuo. (2) That the leaders of the Tokyo army sincerely hope that Manchukuo will achieve peace and prosperity, even at the cost of sacrificing the army's reputation. Many influential military figures here now feel that the entire system of Manchukuo was a big mistake. Even those who implemented this system now have some regrets, but unfortunately, it is too late to change course. Therefore, the problem today is to remove the incompetent elements."</p>
<p>"The biggest criticism is that the Japanese recruit Manchus to hold important positions in the government and as clerks in private institutions, claiming to apply the principle of equality, but in reality, they do not give them any power or rights."</p>

<p>"It is true that the Manchus themselves believe that if they were given real power, bribery would be rampant, but they feel that this evil can be controlled and gradually eliminated. However, the Japanese insist on clearing out the methods commonly used in Chinese politics and business, but who knows, the evil may become even worse, causing resentment, so that the current Manchukuo officials have become puppets, and they are all resentful. However, if the Japanese themselves can be honest and impartial, they would not have created today's corrupt situation. Many Japanese, including officers on active duty and retired, hold important positions and take the opportunity to enrich themselves. These people had not seen much money in the past, and they feel that their time in Manchuria is only a few years, so they are eager to exploit the residents. The money that comes from Japan and is invested in Manchuria is taken for private gain. Even slightly more honest officials do not know how to restrain themselves. These people manage the purchase of opium, even forcing farmers to become bandits by deliberately lowering the price to an extremely low level when the opium is harvested, and then gradually raising it. The Japanese do not allow farmers to sell opium to others, only to the Manchukuo government, and only allow the Manchukuo government to purchase it at the price at the time of harvest. The farmers dare to be angry but dare not speak out. As a result, many are forced to become bandits out of hunger."</p>
<p>"Opium is only one aspect of the maladministration. What is most unpopular is the behavior of the armed immigrants sent to Manchuria by Japan last year. These people numbered a thousand, divided into two groups, and were resettled in northern Harbin. These people were all selected by village chiefs and mayors from the villages and towns at the request of the Colonial Office as so-called 'model' people, with the agreement that they would bring their wives to live with them in Manchuria after two years. The original intention was that these model people would be well-behaved and settle down, staying in Manchuria for two years until their wives arrived. If they were truly model people, they would of course be able to do so, but things went very wrong. When the villages and towns selected and dispatched people, they took advantage of this opportunity to send all the young troublemakers in their area, and the authorities did not know this. Among these were communists, extremists, thieves, and all kinds of ruffians. They were persuaded with sweet words and set off for Manchuria. Within a few months, the Colonial Office learned that these people were doing all kinds of evil in Manchuria, committing heinous crimes, and decided to recall all the lawbreakers, but the Chinese girls in the villages near where they lived had already been abducted in large numbers. At that time, the investigators felt that to stop this shameful situation, it was necessary to transport hundreds of them back to their country, and they finally made this decision resolutely. However, the local area had already suffered greatly. The people of Manchuria had simple thoughts. When they first heard that these people were all model people, they trusted them in everything. When they saw these people committing many evils shamelessly, they began to regret it greatly. Even today, they still harbor resentment in their hearts and will never forget it. The Chinese in Manchuria are especially resentful of banditry. In recent years, the areas where the Japanese have resettled have been plagued by banditry. Therefore, the Japanese government has decided to temporarily suspend sending the third batch of immigrants. Those who have already stayed, although they have rifles, are now asking the authorities for machine guns to defend themselves. In one area, the Japanese even forced farmers from Shandong to sell their only property, land worth 50 yuan per mu, for only two yuan. The farmers were extremely angry, and all the residents of the area were heartbroken and disturbed. Many Japanese, especially ruffians and criminals, are now spread throughout Manchuria, engaging in all kinds of fraud. Recently, when Puyi ascended the throne, a team of Japanese people took Puyi's portrait and forced people to buy it door-to-door. The value of each portrait was at most one cent, but they charged one yuan. The Japanese told the residents that if they did not buy it and hang it in a wooden frame, they would be regarded as unpatriotic and punished. The residents, fearing the tragic fate of many of their compatriots who were called 'unpatriotic' in the past, easily fell for their tricks. One silver dollar is a huge sum for rural farmers, and they must work hard for a long time to make up for this loss. Such incidents are too numerous to mention. Japanese officers who have recently returned from Manchuria also often say that Japanese bandits and Chinese bandits are now rampant in Manchuria, but the outside world rarely hears about it. The Japanese army authorities are now very concerned about this situation, and they are correcting past mistakes wherever they can be reformed. They are often replacing incompetent and disloyal officials, so many unlawful officials have recently fled in panic. Those who remain in office, if they do not change their ways and abandon evil and return to righteousness, will not be easily forgiven, whether they are retired military officers or not. This is the warning given by the Tokyo military authorities. It is estimated that in the future, more former military officers will be sacrificed than civil servants, because these military men know almost nothing outside of military affairs. It is impossible to find them to be competent and happy in positions outside the military."</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Six-Year Opium Prohibition Plan Adopts Resolutions from Past National Conferences; Strict Management of Planting, Transport, Smoking, and Sale</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek believes that although opium prohibition has been advocated for decades, the actual results have been minimal. Recently, potent drugs such as red pills, gold pills, morphine, and heroin have emerged as substitutes, and their harm is even greater than that of opium. Recognizing that past opium prohibition efforts focused solely on strict legislation and urgent deadlines, without considering necessary procedures and comprehensive measures, all opium prohibition laws have become mere window dressing, leading to various unexplainable malpractices. Now, after adopting resolutions from past National Conferences, a six-year prohibition plan will be implemented, with strict management of planting, transport, smoking, and sale. Yesterday, he ordered the governments of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces to strictly comply. The original order is as follows:</p>
<p>"The prohibition of opium has been advocated since the late Qing Dynasty and throughout the Republic of China. For decades, strict prohibitions have been in place, and criminal laws have been detailed. The decrees have been undeniably strict. However, in reality, the results have been minimal. Not only are the planting, transport, smoking, and sale of opium still prevalent everywhere and have been spreading for a long time, but also potent narcotic drugs such as red pills, gold pills, morphine, and heroin have emerged as substitutes. They are easier to carry and harder to prohibit. The number of addicts is increasing, and the harm is even greater than that of opium. If unchecked, the harm will be catastrophic. However, the penalties for these drugs in the laws are the same as for opium, with no stricter measures. Furthermore, corrupt officials, unscrupulous military police, and others have been complying with opium prohibition laws only superficially. They can exploit any relaxation of enforcement to engage in illegal activities and enrich themselves. In some areas, opium prohibition is strictly enforced, while in others, opium taxes are collected. Such contradictory and hypocritical situations are widely seen. The reason for this is that past opium prohibition efforts focused solely on strict legislation and urgent deadlines, without considering necessary procedures or planning comprehensive measures. The goal was to achieve superficial, impressive announcements and eliminate this deeply rooted scourge in a short period. Both the government and anti-drug organizations have been guilty of this flaw, resulting in all opium prohibition laws becoming mere window dressing and leading to various unexplainable malpractices. When this Chairman supervised the bandit suppression in the past, he was deeply saddened by the pervasive drug atmosphere and witnessed the emptiness of the prohibition orders. He deeply understands that to fulfill our Party's policy of completely eradicating drug addiction, we must adopt practical and effective methods. Therefore, after adopting the six-year opium prohibition plan resolved at the National Conference in the past, we will use scientific methods to issue various opium prohibition regulations, strictly manage all aspects of planting, transport, smoking, and sale, implement control, and gradually ban and reduce them year by year. This is to correct past mistakes and seek fundamental eradication. First, regarding the prohibition of smoking, those who smoke among Party, government, military, and academic personnel will be strictly prohibited first. The 'Measures for Opium Prohibition in Party, Government, Military, and Academic Circles' and the 'Regulations for Investigation and Punishment' have been issued. Those who are addicted and cannot quit within the prescribed period will be severely punished to set an example for the common people. For ordinary people who smoke, each province and region will be ordered to establish opium cessation hospitals and order addicts to undergo treatment. Those who are old, sick, or unable to quit within a short period will be allowed to apply for a limited-time opium smoking permit, which will gradually reduce the amount of opium smoked each year, with complete cessation in no more than six years. Second, regarding the prohibition of sale, since temporary smoking is allowed, there must be a corresponding supply of raw opium. Local authorities will specially permit the establishment of raw opium shops to sell to those in need, limiting the number of shops and only allowing them to decrease, not increase. Third, regarding the prohibition of planting, we will start with the inland provinces. Since the winter before last, we have been limiting the planting of opium. The 'Measures for Dispatching Personnel to Investigate and Prohibit Opium Planting in Ten Provinces' were issued. Over the past two years, continuous efforts have been made to prohibit opium and eradicate opium plants in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces. As a result, the famous opium-producing counties in western Henan, northern Hubei, and northern Anhui have reported the complete eradication of opium plants. In other border provinces where opium has been planted, no new planting is allowed. For provinces and regions that have traditionally planted opium and are unable to switch to food crops or other products, they will be required to report the acreage and estimated yield of opium planted and obtain special licenses for phased and gradual reduction and eventual prohibition. Fourth, regarding the prohibition of transport, the authorities will determine the price of opium in the producing areas, investigate the quantity of supply and demand, and uniformly collect and transport opium from border provinces where opium planting has not been prohibited. Merchants who are specially permitted to purchase opium will be issued public purchase licenses and required to transport opium publicly and unload it into public warehouses to control the transfer, transport, receipt, and distribution of opium, prevent leakage and flooding, and achieve the goal of complete eradication in each stage. Based on the above four measures, the number of old and sick smokers, the quantity of opium needed, the number of raw opium shops, and the acreage and yield of opium planted will all be accurately统计，严格管理，逐步缩减，以至廓清，使嗜好</p>

<h3>Songjiang: Fundraising for the Repair of Daguan Bridge</h3>
<p>Daguan Bridge, located outside the east gate of Jinshanwei, spans the Yanyan River and is an important passage for north-south transportation. Due to years of disrepair, it is on the verge of collapse, making travel difficult in wind and rain. The local people have long wanted to repair it, but they lacked funds and have not been able to do so. Recently, Mr. Shen Jixiang, Shi Jiliang, Song Shoupeng, and Zhang Qifeng have been enthusiastic about public welfare and resolutely launched a fundraising campaign. They have already raised more than 2,000 yuan, and the stonemason Qian Shunfu has been contracted to build the bridge. Construction has been underway for many days and is about to be completed.</p>
<h3>Villagers Kidnapped in Kuatangbang</h3>
<p>At Zhang Shouyu's house in Tangzihang, about three miles west of Kuatang Bridge in this city, there is one son and one daughter, and the family is well-off. They were coveted by bandits. Suddenly, this morning (25th), seven or eight bandits broke into the house. First, they ordered the victim to remain silent, then they took rings and earrings from his children. Then they found Shouyu's son, Daosheng, and kidnapped him. They immediately escaped by boat.</p>
<h3>Steamboat Capsizes in Collision, One Person Dies</h3>
<p>The steamboat from Tinglin to Minhang is used to transport passengers to Shanghai. At about 10 a.m. yesterday, when the steamboat arrived in Minhangpu and was about to dock at the pier, a fast boat from Shanghai suddenly arrived. The steamboat did not have time to steer clear, causing a collision. The steamboat gradually sank, and 27 passengers and more than ten pigs fell into the water. The fast boat immediately stopped after realizing what had happened. Surrounding fishing boats gathered to help rescue the victims. As a result, one person drowned, and the rest were rescued. More than ten pigs also drowned. It is reported that the owner of the steamboat has already filed a complaint.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: The Education Sector Strives for the Right to Manage Parks</h3>
<p>After the Municipal Public Property Management Committee was ordered to be dissolved, the question of who should manage the parks has become a major issue of concern to the public. The People's Education Promotion Association of this county believes that the management of parks should be governed by the education administrative organs in accordance with the education laws and regulations promulgated by the central government and the county organization law promulgated by the National Government. In addition to contacting the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department, an emergency meeting was held yesterday, chaired by Zhu Ruoxi. It was resolved to send a telegram to the Education Department, ordering the Wuxi County Government to hand over the management to the education organs. Ten representatives were elected to go to the County Party Headquarters and the County Government to appeal. Finally, a declaration was issued, calling on all sectors of the Party and government to advocate for this. However, Gui Wochen, a member of the County Party Headquarters, stated that the parks should be managed by the education authorities, as required by law, and there would be no obstacles.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau's Investigation of Drugs Causes Repercussions</h3>
<p>Amid the strict opium prohibition, Chen Yuchu, the director of the Public Security Bureau and head of the investigation team of the Opium Prohibition Committee in this county, sent inspectors to lead the police to search for drugs at the Li Wansheng Candle Shop in Tantou Alley on the morning of the 22nd of this month. The situation was serious, but nothing was found. Local gentry who were hired as members of the Opium Prohibition Committee, such as Qian Sunqing, Cheng Jingtang, and Li Changping, sent a letter to County Magistrate and Chairman Yan Shenyu yesterday to appeal for the people. The original letter stated that opium prohibition should start with persuasion and propaganda to encourage smokers to quit voluntarily and give them a chance to rehabilitate themselves, so as to avoid punishing them without teaching them. However, it is reported that the Public Security Bureau is searching everywhere, causing great disturbance. The recent Li Wansheng case has caused the local people to feel insecure, disrupting business and affecting social security. The local people have complained a lot. If someone has reported the case to the county, the false accuser should be severely punished and sent to the province for serious punishment. If it is a secret order from a higher authority, the higher authority should be informed and the original accuser should be severely punished. In the future, the opium policy should be implemented with both leniency and severity, in the hope of achieving the goal of prohibition. Otherwise, we will have to resign.</p>
<h3>Drought Affects Farmland</h3>
<p>This year, the weather has been dry, and there has been no rain during the yellow plum season, causing the soil to crack, making it impossible for farmers to transplant seedlings. A drought is imminent, and the river water is unusually shallow, causing several small boats in rural areas to stop operating. The passenger boat from Wujin to Liyang has also stopped operating. Farmers are eager to transplant seedlings, so they are hiring water pump boats to pump water, but most of the water pump boats cannot enter the river, leaving them helpless. It is now the 16th district, and the Yinyong Township area has been dredging the canal in an attempt to remedy the situation. According to veteran farmers, this kind of drought has not been seen in sixty years. Yesterday's weather was also very sultry, with the thermometer rising to about 90 degrees. The scorching sun caused pedestrians to sweat profusely, and throat ailments have become rampant in the city.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Drought in Various Townships; Since the Start of Summer, the Weather Has Been Dry, and the Rivers Have Been Shallow.</h3>
<p>Now is the yellow plum season, the time for transplanting rice seedlings. Due to the prolonged drought, irrigation is impossible. Farmers are all sighing. If there is no rain within the next ten days, the soil will crack and a drought will be inevitable.</p>
<h3>Child Transporting Opium Arrested</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 24th, in the southern part of the county, a boy of fifteen or sixteen years old was passing by on a rickshaw. Suddenly, the rickshaw had an accident and was stopped by the guards of the business association. Unexpectedly, the boy got out of the car and ran away in a hurry. The rickshaw puller chased after him to ask for the fare, and a dispute arose. Later, the guards saw that the paper bag carried by the boy was quite suspicious. They took it off and searched it. Unexpectedly, it was filled with opium. They immediately detained him and took him back to the association headquarters and handed him over to the Public Security Bureau. According to the boy, his name is Song Shaosheng. He used to be an apprentice on a boat in Suzhou. More than ten taels of opium were entrusted to him to carry. The Public Security Bureau transferred him to the County Justice Department for verification on the 25th.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Soldiers and Officers Committing Crimes are Punished Separately</h3>
<p>Liao Xingxiang, platoon leader of the first platoon of the second company of the Jiangyin Fortress Area Garrison Battalion, was ordered to be stationed in Changshan. According to the regulations on fortress areas, fishermen are not allowed to fish in the nearby river. Recently, fishermen have been setting nets there, but Liao did not stop them. It is said that platoon leader Liao is suspected of taking bribes. Commander Xie learned about it and, believing it was a matter of extortion, detained him for questioning and submitted the case to the Ministry of Military Affairs for verification. Also, Private Long Yun (from Sichuan) of the third company recently committed an act of violence for no reason and killed a deputy squad leader. Commander Xie also questioned him and submitted the case to the Ministry of Military Affairs for legal action.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Drug Pill Offender Arrested in Lingdian Port</h3>
<p>Drug trafficking is rampant in this county and harms the local area. The County Public Security Bureau recently ordered all branch bureaus to strictly investigate and arrest offenders. Inspector Ding and others went to Lingdian Port in a special car and arrested Cao Hengsan, a red pill offender, in the town. They confiscated half a tube of red pills, totaling 212 pills. He confessed that he bought them from Chen Yaoming in Tangjia Town. Later, they went to the town and arrested Chen. They were immediately escorted back to the county and reported to the Commissioner's Office, awaiting strict punishment.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Shandong Social Education Visiting Group Arrives in Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>A social education visiting group of more than 30 people from the Shandong Provincial Department of Education's Social Education Service Personnel Training Class, led by Wang Mianmin, the director of social education affairs, arrived at Zhenjiang Normal School on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Chen Bangshi, the director of administrative affairs of the school, entertained them. Yesterday morning, they visited the Fangongqiao Provincial People's Education Center, where Zhao, the director of the center, personally entertained them and led them to visit the exhibition rooms of each department for a week. The group asked in detail about the various social education methods implemented by the center. Director Zhao also presented them with several copies of the center's People's Education Newsletter for reference. The group then visited the Provincial Central People's School on Zhongzheng Road, and then visited the Provincial Zhenjiang Library on Taiping Bridge. In the afternoon, they toured the famous scenic spots of the three mountains in the provincial capital. It is reported that the group is scheduled to travel to Wuxi by car this morning to visit various social education institutions.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Pirates Defeated in Linjiadun</h3>
<p>The coast of Tongru is often invaded by large groups of pirates, which is very rampant. The Provincial Security Department specially dispatched a maritime guerrilla force to Fengju area to suppress them. The Nantong District Commissioner's Office also sent the 13th Provincial Public Security Team to block them. The water police defeated the pirates in the waters of Linjiadun and are pursuing them.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Township Chief Kidnapped and Killed</h3>
<p>Xu Yongqing, the township chief of Shuangju Township in the tenth district of this county, was kidnapped by bandits last winter. His family was repeatedly ordered to raise money for his ransom. Because it was difficult to raise the money, they failed to redeem him in time, which angered the bandits. A few days ago, the bandits shot and killed Township Chief Xu and threw his body into the river. Later, someone discovered it and reported it to his family, who went to collect and coffin the body. The body was so rotten that it was unbearable to look at. The situation was extremely tragic.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Prolonged Drought Leads to Drought</h3>
<p>Jiaxing has not rained for several months. The river water has dried up, and there is a shortage of drinking water. Many boats cannot pass, and navigation on the outer river is also inconvenient. The fields in the countryside have all cracked. Most of the early rice that has been planted has withered, and the late rice cannot be planted at all. Those in high-lying areas, even if they hire workers day and night to pump water, are of little help. Other crops have also withered, resulting in a severe drought.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: The Disturbance of Destroying the Foreign Tile Company Expands</h3>
<p>The disturbance of destroying the Jinmen Foreign Tile Company in Ganyao Town in this county, which occurred the day before yesterday, has expanded recently and cannot be eliminated. The reason is that the foreman of the company, Ying Fengting, has always been very harsh on the workers. A worker from Taizhou, Zhu Keyan, whose mother was critically ill, had to return to his hometown and asked Ying to settle his wages. Ying firmly refused and reprimanded Zhu. That night, Cai Yimei, the foreman of the Taishan Company, and five or six workers went to the factory to negotiate. It was late at night, and the workers in the factory mistakenly thought they were thieves. They tied up Cai and others and sent them to the security team for processing. Later, the town office invited Jin Hong, a shareholder of Jinmen Company, to mediate before releasing them. The next day, more than 300 workers from the Santai and Taoxin factories, each carrying weapons, led by Zhang Silong, the foreman of the Santai factory, and Wang Ruhuo, the foreman of the Taoxin factory, went to the engine room of the Jinmen Company and wantonly destroyed it. All the machines were completely damaged. Then they swarmed to Ying Fengting's house, looking for Ying Fengting, but could not find him. They searched Ying's house and stole 300 yuan in cash, three gold rings, a gold bracelet, and several pieces of clothing before dispersing. Jinmen Company held an emergency meeting, photographed all the engine rooms and Ying Fengting's house, and hired a lawyer to sue in the local court, demanding compensation and severe punishment. Six tile factories, including Santai, Taishan, and Taoxin, jointly went on strike to show their resistance. The disturbance will continue to expand.</p>

In the afternoon, Dr. Noll returned for treatment. Because of the busy government affairs in Nanjing and the scheduled meeting with the Japanese ambassador, Wang returned to Nanjing by overnight train at 11 p.m. last night. Chen Gongbo, Zeng Zhongming, and Chu Minyi accompanied him. Mr. Zeng Zhongming told our reporter yesterday that Wang has been busy with government affairs recently and has not had time to treat his old illness. This time, he took time to come to Shanghai to ask Dr. Noll to examine him. There was no other task. The examination result showed that the sugar content has been slightly reduced, and the liver disease has not progressed. Because he needs to attend the Executive Yuan meeting tomorrow (today), he rushed back to Nanjing.</p>

<h3>Chambers of Commerce Jointly Telegraphed Requesting the Continued Collection of Import Duty on Foreign Sugar</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received telegrams yesterday from Pang Songhui, representative of the Guangdong Qinlian Chamber of Commerce, and the Chengdu Chamber of Commerce in Sichuan, forwarding them to the Ministry, requesting that the import duty on foreign sugar be collected as before. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Telegram on Behalf of the Ministry and Yuan:</h3>
<p>Nanjing National Government, Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry, Greetings. Recently, a letter was received from Pang Songhui, representative of the Guangdong Qinlian Sugar Merchants, stating: "Recently, I read in the newspaper that the Ministry of Finance has decided to announce a new import tariff on July 1, and there is talk of reducing the tariff rate on foreign sugar, causing widespread anxiety and bringing the sugar market to a standstill. I believe that our country's local sugar could originally be self-sufficient. Since the opening of sea trade, foreign sugar has been dumped, resulting in an annual loss of more than 100 million yuan. Since the Ministry of Finance revised the import sugar tax in the past two years, the import of foreign sugar has sharply decreased, and local sugar has been able to recover, and rural areas have been able to revive, saving a lot of losses. Although the current tariff rate on foreign sugar is still not as high as that of Western countries, it can still be implemented effectively. Now, if the tariff rate is reduced, and the tariff barriers are removed, it will inevitably become the tail of foreign sugar dumping again. The local sugar that is just budding will have no place to stand. Considering the tariff protection policy, wouldn't it be greatly contradictory? Moreover, reducing taxes to benefit the people is still a concern for affecting the budget, how can there be tax cuts to hinder people's livelihood? Your association leads the group of merchants and cares about the sugar industry. After considering this rise and fall, you will definitely be frightened. I am sending a special letter to urgently telegraph the government, regarding the revision of the new import tariff, the import tax on foreign sugar, even if it cannot be increased to the minimum limit, please maintain the original tax rate, and must not reduce it again, in order to maintain a lifeline for domestic sugar." Also, a telegram from the Chengdu Chamber of Commerce in Sichuan was received with the same content. Each has been approved. It is true that reducing tariffs on foreign sugar is destroying domestic sugar. I believe that our wise government will not do this. However, rumors are spreading, and sugar merchants are panicking and telling each other. The domestic sugar market is almost at a standstill. It is reasonable to send a telegram to your government and departments for review and verification, and to request that the tax rate on foreign sugar in the import tariff be collected according to the old regulations, and to give a reply first, in order to reassure the merchants and people. It is extremely urgent."</p>
<h3>Reply to the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Reply directly: Recently, your association's telegram on behalf of the Ministry, requesting that the import duty on foreign sugar be collected as before, has been received.</p>
<p>This association has already telegraphed the National Government and various departments and ministries, requesting that it be filed. Once a reply is received, it will be forwarded to you. A corresponding letter is sent to your association in advance, hoping that you will check and take note of it. Addressed to the Chengdu Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Will Convene a National Telecommunications Conference to Comprehensively Plan and Reorganize National Telecommunications; the Merger of Postal and Telecommunications Can Be Completed by the End of This Month</h3>
<p>In order to develop the national postal and telecommunications business, the Ministry of Communications, in addition to scheduling the National Postal Conference to be held on September 1, also plans to convene the National Telecommunications Conference on the 4th. A reporter from Xinxin inquired about everything at the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau yesterday, and according to the spokesperson of the Bureau, in order to comprehensively plan and reorganize the national telecommunications facilities, the Ministry of Communications now intends to convene the National Postal Conference, scheduled to be held in Beijing on September 1, and after its closing, it is scheduled to convene the National Telecommunications Conference on the 4th. At that time, the directors of the telecommunications administration bureaus and telephone bureaus of various provinces and cities must attend, and telecommunications experts will also be invited to attend, in order to collect ideas and benefit from them. The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau has now prepared proposals and will submit them for discussion at that time. As for the merger of postal and telecommunications, since the order was received to proceed, fifteen branch bureaus have been merged and are ready, and the rest are in progress. Since this city is the national commercial center, there are more than thirty postal and telecommunications branch bureaus, so it is more difficult to proceed. It is expected that all mergers will be completed by the end of this month. It is also heard that Bao Keyong, Director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, was summoned to Beijing by Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua the day before yesterday to report on the recent situation of the Bureau's business and the merger of postal and telecommunications. He will return to Shanghai within days.</p>
<h3>The Preparatory Office for the Establishment of the Trust Bureau of the Central Bank Has Designated Ye Zhuotang as the Director of the Preparatory Office and Appointed Nine Preparatory Members and Two Advisors</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Executive Yuan of the National Government has resolved to add a Trust Bureau to the Central Bank. Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Bank, has designated Ye Zhuotang, the Managing Director of the Bank, to concurrently serve as the Director of the Preparatory Office, and has appointed Zhang Du, Li Yaohuang, Wu Jingan, Zhu Shikang, Chen Zhongsheng, Tang Zaijun, Ma Duo, Kong Xiangmian, and Liu Wangsu as preparatory members, and Baker and Xu Weizhen as advisors. Mr. Ye has taken office yesterday to prepare. It is also heard that, except for Ma Duo and Chen Zhongsheng, all of the appointees are existing employees of the Bank.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Railways Ordered the Railway Bureau to Decide to Use Baoshan Road as the Bureau Site and Appoint Dong Dayou to Design and Supervise Construction</h3>
<p>A Nanjing telegram states that the Ministry of Railways has ordered the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administration to decide to use Baoshan Road as the location of the construction bureau of the railway, and to negotiate to recover it for use. It also approved the appointment of Dong Dayou to design and supervise the construction.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Manufacturers in This City Went to Peiping to Visit the Iron Exhibition and Returned to Shanghai to Report That Over 1.4 Million People Visited; the Products of This City Made a Good Impression in North China</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways held the Third Exhibition of Products from Along the Railway Line in Peiping, and specially invited manufacturers from various ports along the line to visit. According to Mr. Gao Shiheng, a representative of the silk weaving industry in this city, the Shanghai delegation returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. In addition to reporting to all parties, he said that they left Shanghai on a special train on the 15th and arrived in Peiping on the 17th. They attended the reception of the Iron Exhibition, with more than 300 representatives from along the national railway line. Tan Yaozong, Deputy Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, presided over the meeting and reported on the purpose of the meeting and the recent improvements in the railway industry by the Ministry of Railways, which can be divided into seven categories: 1. Responsible for transportation, 2. Responsible for intermodal transportation, 3. Managing honor industries, 4. Managing cold storage, 5. Collecting payments for customers, 6. Hospitality services, 7. Holding two exhibitions every year, hoping that national manufacturers will work hard together so that the national railway industry can be fully developed, etc. On behalf of all manufacturers, I made a reply, hoping that the Ministry of Railways will strive to shorten the time of transportation and reduce transportation costs, so that the cost of domestic products can be reduced and compete with foreign goods. At the same time, I requested that the exhibition be open to the public for free for three days, so that the people of Peiping could have the opportunity to visit (the venue of the meeting was the Taimiao, which is a part of the Taigong Museum, which usually charges 20 copper coins for admission, and the fee was charged during several meeting periods). The request was adopted by the association. They visited separately. The venue was divided into ten pavilions, named: Famous Products, Jinpu, Beining, Pingsui, Jiaoji, Daoqing, Longhai, Pinghan, Yuehan, Beijing-Shanghai, and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo. The pavilions were full of dazzling displays, solemn and magnificent, bringing together the essence of national goods from all over the country. The pavilions offered as much as possible for local products, especially agricultural and mineral raw materials and handicrafts, which attracted attention. The highest number of visitors per day reached 94,000, and the average was 50,000 per day. It is expected that the 40-day exhibition period will have 2.5 million visitors. The population of Peiping is nearly one million, and the others come from all over the country, such as Shandong and Shanxi, with groups coming to visit the exhibition organized by the government. Except for the Nanyang Industrial Exposition and the West Lake Expo, this is the most successful. There are sales offices next to the venue, and all regions participated. The best-selling items are Meya silk, Jinhua ham, and Shanghai women's shoes. The sales office of Meya Silk Factory was crowded every day, competing to be the first, fearing they would be left behind. The factory brought more than 50 boxes of silk, which were completely sold out. The people of North China did not pay attention to domestic goods at first, but were surprised to see the abundant production. Shops in Peiping openly sell Japanese goods without any surprise. If the domestic goods industry does not rush to catch up, the North China market will be unimaginable. I admire the Ministry of Railways' willingness to spend money to hold the exhibition, which has a long-term vision. Ordinary exhibitions are limited to one area, but the Ministry of Railways can use its superior position to bring together the whole country. If it can continue to be held, so that the national people will love and use domestic goods, the effect will be significant. Manufacturers should also take the opportunity to refer to research and promote products, so that officials and merchants can cooperate and work together. The delegation was very satisfied with the hospitality of the two railway administrations, so they specially prepared a letter to thank them and presented a silver shield as a memorial.</p>
<h3>Outrage of Various Groups in Shanghai County at Nanhui County's Request to Divide the Fourth and Fifth Districts</h3>
<p>Since the division of the city and county in Shanghai County, only the six rural districts remain in the county. Now, according to the order, they are merged into five districts, with an area of only 450 square miles and a population of only 110,000, with very weak economic strength. Recently, according to Articles 7, 5, 6, and 7 of the Provincial, Municipal, and County Boundary Survey Regulations, the third county administrative conference submitted a request to the provincial government to transfer the interlaced areas of the county with Nanhui and Songjiang counties to the jurisdiction of the county. While the case is being investigated by the provincial government, which dispatched Miao Qiping, together with the county heads of the related counties, the Nanhui County side suddenly requested the provincial government to transfer the fourth and fifth districts of Shanghai County, namely the old Sanlin and Chenxing two townships, to the jurisdiction of Nanhui, organized groups, dispatched representatives, and went to the province to lobby. The provincial government's instructions even had the phrase "should be approved." As a result, various groups and people from all walks of life in Shanghai County were greatly indignant, because the county now has only five districts left. If two more districts are divided, it will no longer be a county. Moreover, Nanhui's area is eight times that of Shanghai, and its population is four times that of Shanghai, so it should not ask for benefits from the smaller Shanghai County. It is now heard that representatives of various groups have held several meetings, and the county party headquarters has taken the lead in drafting and publishing a circular telegram, asking the provincial government to clearly indicate whether Shanghai still needs to be preserved, and asking national public opinion to make a fair judgment. On one hand, representatives are sent to the province to petition. The issue of correcting administrative regions in the country has caused such a big stir, which is a bit of a fuss. However, Nanhui County's excessive demands have aroused the aversion of Shanghai County, which is really inappropriate. I don't know what the result will be in the future. Here is a telegram from various groups in Shanghai County to the provincial government, which is recorded as follows: Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, Provincial Government, Department of Civil Affairs, Greetings. It is hereby noted that the third county administrative conference of this county unanimously resolved to submit a request to reorganize the area of this county with Nanhui and Songjiang counties. The motive is that after the division of the city and county, only six remote districts remain in the county, with an area of less than 460 square miles and a population of only 110,000, with very weak economic capacity. Therefore, according to Articles 7, 5, 6, and 7 of the Provincial, Municipal, and County Boundary Survey Regulations, it is requested to transfer the abnormally interlaced areas of this county with Nanhui and Songjiang counties to the jurisdiction of this county, on the one hand, to make the terrain tidy and facilitate administration, and on the other hand, the area of this county can be slightly expanded to facilitate construction, and there is no loss in the neighboring county. This is a domestic reorganization of administrative boundaries, not a loss of national territory to foreign countries. The county being divided has no need to argue, and the provincial government believes that Shanghai County has historical relations and must be preserved, then it will certainly vigorously preside over the matter of this boundary division. Unexpectedly, Nanhui County actually made an unreasonable request to transfer the fourth and fifth districts of this county to its jurisdiction, and the provincial government's instruction No. 2670 of the Civil Affairs Department even had the phrase "should be approved," which is very surprising. According to Article 2 of the Jiangsu Provincial Method for Reorganizing Autonomous Regions in Various Counties, the number of districts in each county should be at least five and at most fifteen. This county originally had six districts, and now it is ordered to be merged into five districts. If two districts are divided, only three districts will remain, with an area of only 350 square miles and a population of less than 80,000. Is it still necessary for this county to exist? This is one thing that is incomprehensible. If according to the intention of the county head of Nanhui County, Shanghai should implement mergers or changes in accordance with Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the Provincial, Municipal, and County Boundary Survey Regulations due to changes in the administrative regions of the province and city. If the provincial government approves, then in addition to the fourth and fifth districts of this county being transferred to Nanhui, the other three districts should also be decided at the same time, either merged into Shanghai City or归song County, and the provincial government should send personnel to come to survey and divide, and there is no need for the Shanghai County Head, who is about to be abolished, to survey together. This is two things that are incomprehensible. Before the implementation of district, township, and town autonomy in the fourth district of this county, it was named Sanlin Township, and the fifth district was named Chenxing Township. Now, the county head of Nanhui County suddenly said in a telegram, "Chenxing and Sanlin two townships" or "Sanlin and Chenxing two towns," flashing its words, intending to deceive the provincial government, thinking that the division of two townships or two towns from Shanghai County is not very relevant. However, this kind of boundary division event is of great importance. Why not carefully check the maps and documents and issue the order "should be approved" hastily? This is three things that are incomprehensible. Nanhui County uses the Huangpu River as a natural shape, strongly wanting to cut off the fourth and fifth districts of this county and bring them under its jurisdiction. I don't know that the so-called natural shape of the land refers to places where the boundary lines are not very clear, and it is appropriate to delineate them according to the natural shape. It is not necessary for the division of provinces, cities, and counties to follow all natural boundaries. If according to Nanhui County's statement, then my Jiangsu should abandon Huaibei, Xuzhou, and Haizhou in the north, and take Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou in the south, and use the Yangtze and Qiantang Rivers as natural boundaries. I wonder if the provincial government also intends to do this? This is four things that are incomprehensible. What is even more strange is that the county head of Nanhui County said in a telegram that the rivers in this county mostly flow west out of the Huangpu, and the two townships cross the river, affecting the river outlet, which is even more important. Not only the central river and other townships and towns that are currently under the jurisdiction of Nanhui County are inserted into the fourth and fifth districts of this county, and the rivers all lead to the Huangpu and have not been blocked by the fourth and fifth districts of this county, but the tone of the language is like a small European country demanding an outlet to the sea. The small matter of reorganizing administrative regions domestically uses the tone of international negotiations, which is truly extremely ridiculous. The provincial government did not refute it, but approved it. This is five things that are incomprehensible. Furthermore, the so-called "interspersed land" refers to the case where the land is completely in County A, but the administration belongs to County B. Although the fifth district of this county is connected to Nanhui County on the east, south, and north, it is connected to the districts west of the Huangpu River in this county on the west, and is connected to the county seat. As for the fourth district, it is connected to Shanghai City in the north, the Huangpu River in the west, and only connected to Nanhui County in the southeast. Now it is forcibly referred to as "flying insertion," which is nothing but a strong argument and robbery. This is six things that are incomprehensible. In short, the ten townships and towns including the Central River of Nanhui County are inserted into the fourth and fifth districts of this county, and the distance from the county seat of Nanhui County is 80 li, and the distance from the county seat of Shanghai County is only 12 or 13 li. It is appropriate to transfer the townships and towns including the Central River of Nanhui County to Shanghai County, and it is not appropriate to transfer the fourth and fifth districts of Shanghai County to Nanhui County. Also, the area of Nanhui County is quite large, and the removal of the central river and other townships and towns, which are shaped like a basin, has no major impact, while the removal of two districts from Shanghai will make it impossible to form a county. Therefore, it is appropriate to transfer the ten townships and towns including the Central River to Shanghai County, and it is not possible to transfer the fourth and fifth districts of Shanghai County to Nanhui. This association and others have always believed that there is no need to dispute the domestic reorganization of boundaries. If the provincial government believes that Shanghai County should be abolished, please issue a clear order for implementation immediately, without having to linger on one's last breath. If it is believed that it has value for preservation, please reject the unreasonable demands of Nanhui County and reorganize them separately in accordance with the methods set by the third county administrative conference of this county. The county party headquarters and various agencies and groups are unable to dispatch representatives to the province to petition due to insufficient funds. Therefore, they dare to state the reasons and send a telegram to your department (government) (office) for review and approval, and quickly give clear instructions for compliance. I can't help but earnestly pray. Shanghai County Party Headquarters, County Education Association, County Farmers' Association, County Women's Association, Minhang Town Chamber of Commerce, Maqiao Town Chamber of Commerce, Sanlin Town Chamber of Commerce, respectfully kowtow together.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan People Strive to Change Provinces, Telegraphed Anhui Huining Two Fellow Provincial Associations to Strive Together</h3>
<p>Since the news reported that the Nanchang Headquarters, in order to facilitate administrative facilities and bandit suppression plans, specially sent a letter to the Executive Yuan to transfer the entire Wuyuan County of Anhui Province to the jurisdiction of Jiangxi, and instructed the competent authorities to file and handle it, the people of various counties in Anhui Province have paid serious attention, and the Anhui Fellow Provincial Association and the Huining Fellow Provincial Association in Shanghai have asked to strive together. It is heard that the Huining Fellow Provincial Association and others yesterday...</p>
<h3>Muslims Celebrated Christmas Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Islamic calendar, the first day of each month is the day when the moon is first seen after the new moon (if it is rainy, it is calculated according to "Big Two Small Three," that is, if the previous month is a big month, the second day is the first day, and if the previous month is a small month, the third day is the first day), and there is no leap month. Twelve months are one year (if there is a leap month in the lunar calendar, the Islamic calendar will be advanced by one month). Yesterday was the twelfth day of the third month of the Islamic calendar.</p>
<p>National flag and moon flag crossed in front of the gate of the Zhejiang Road Mosque (photo by Tianmin)</p>
<p>That is, the birthday of Muhammad, and Muslims all over the world held grand celebrations. The Ten Directions Mosque in this port also held ceremonies, and the religious leaders of each temple lectured on Manerzi (that is, the canon). Muslims went to nearby temples to participate in the celebrations, which was quite a grand occasion for a while. It is also heard that Muslims in Zhenjiang, Hankou, and other places went to public places to give grand speeches to promote the true teachings to non-believers. It is said that the various mosques in this port are not prepared enough and will hold large-scale publicity next year on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Also received a telegram from the Ziyang Academy and various public law groups in Wuyuan County, recorded as follows: "Shanghai Anhui Fellow Provincial Association, Huining Fellow Provincial Association, and forwarded to the Wuyuan Fellow Provincial Association, greetings. Reading the newspaper, it is reported that the Nanchang Headquarters, in order to facilitate political facilities, has decided to transfer the entire Wuyuan County of Anhui to the jurisdiction of Jiangxi Province, and specially sent a letter to the Executive Yuan, ordering the competent department to file and handle it, which is extremely shocking. The relationship between Wuyuan and Anhui is closer than any county in the entire province. Observing the organizational structure of Anhui groups scattered in various provinces, they all use Zhu Zi as a symbol, representing the culture and history of the province, which has become a permanent and unchangeable situation. Wuyuan is the hometown of Zhu Zi. Now, transferring Wuyuan to the jurisdiction of Jiangxi is tantamount to shaking the foundation of the entire Anhui Province. In addition to sending a telegram to the Nanchang Headquarters of the Executive Yuan to argue on the basis of reason, please unanimously support it to protect the reputation of the province and the friendship of the entire township. Wuyuan Ziyang Academy and various public law groups kowtow respectfully," etc. It is heard that the Huining Fellow Provincial Association in Shanghai will convene a general meeting to discuss solutions to this issue.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Salt Affairs Inspectorate Reorganizes Changlu Salt Tax</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Finance Salt Affairs Inspectorate in this city, in view of the fact that the Changlu salt tax is a major source of annual revenue in North China, and the situation of private sales and loss of tax revenues has been increasing in recent years, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi's trip north to inspect the Changlu salt tax is also an important task. The Inspectorate once sent Chief Inspector Zeng Yangfeng to inspect, and Zeng has newly drafted a very detailed written opinion on reorganizing Changlu salt affairs. The main points are divided as follows:</p>
<h3>Historical Situation: Over the years, the</h3>
<p>investigative affairs in the Lu District have tended to be corrupt and are in a state of decline. The loss of tax revenue is calculated to be 9 million yuan (including 600,000 yuan in shore tax, which belongs to the loss of the Henan Tax Bureau), and the total amount of private sales on the banks of Hebei and Henan in the Lu District is about 1,871,000 dan, which is equivalent to a loss of 15 million yuan in tax revenue (including shore tax). As for the rise and fall of the three major sources of private salt in the Lu District: (A) In the saltpeter area, official sales accounted for 52% of the actual needs of the population in the 12th year of the Republic of China, and decreased to 8% in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. In the ten years, official sales decreased by 84%. (B) In the abandoned beach area, official sales accounted for 81% of the actual needs of the population in the 12th year of the Republic of China, and decreased to 21% in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. In the ten years, official sales decreased by 74%. (C) In the salt beach area, official sales accounted for 98% of the actual needs of the population in the 12th year of the Republic of China, and decreased to 54% in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. In the ten years, official sales decreased by 45%. In addition to the above, there is also a large amount of private salt in Liaoning and private salt in the east. As for the bad habits of the exclusive merchants in various regions, such as mixing geological materials into the salt and hoarding for profit, etc., the Lu merchants are even worse than other regions.</p>
<h3>Reorganization Plan: There are seven reorganization plans: (1) Management of salt</h3>
<p>beaches, (2) Management of abandoned beaches, (3) Management of local salt, (4) Management of private salt in Liaoning and private salt in the east, (5) Reorganization of private investigations, (6) Management of transportation merchants, (7) Improvement of office efficiency. There are four plans for the management of salt beaches. The management of abandoned beaches is to repair roads. For the management of local salt areas, the superficial solution is to discourage the consumption of local salt and strictly prohibit transportation and sale at the same time. The fundamental solution is to ask soil experts to test the technique of changing the properties of saline soil to benefit agriculture, and to formulate regulations for county magistrates to assist in private investigations and rewards and punishments to encourage them. For the management of private salt in Liaoning and private salt in the east, two shallow-water patrol boats must be manufactured separately, equipped with machine guns and sea searchlights, to facilitate cruising in the Luandong area, and police stations must be set up along the coast to assist. Other expenses such as the cost of reorganization and planning, such as the construction of barracks, field affairs offices, motor roads, salt river bridges, telephone installation, etc., will cost 536,500 yuan, which will be completed in two years, and each year will require 268,000 yuan. It is proposed to follow the precedent of Huaibei, and a reorganization fee of five cents per dan will be added for the transportation and sale of edible salt and fish salt on the banks of Hebei and Henan. Calculated according to the current sales volume, an annual amount of 189,000 yuan can be collected, but in order to start construction immediately, it is proposed to temporarily order a short-term loan from the bank, and this additional donation will be used as a mortgage, etc. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi's plan will be reviewed and determined whether it can be implemented after an on-site inspection during his trip north.</p>
<h3>Sun Tonggang Will Come to Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the young aviator Sun Tonggang, who went to Beijing to visit Chairman Chiang, sent a letter to Lin Wojiang, Secretary-General of the Aviation Association, saying that after visiting Chiang, he would come to Shanghai to attend the meeting of the founders of the Aviation Society. According to Mr. Lin's interview with reporters, Mr. Sun may come to Shanghai today, and the meeting of the founders of the Aviation Society will be convened soon. When he went to Beijing and Jiangxi last time, he slightly inquired about the opinions of the founders in the two places, and they all expressed their support. If anyone is unable to attend due to official business, they will definitely send representatives to attend.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Representatives of the National Lawyers Association to Amend the Constitution</h3>
<p>The Lawyers Association of the Republic of China convened a special review meeting to amend the articles of association. Yesterday afternoon, representatives of various lawyers' associations continued to meet at the Shanghai Lawyers' Association. Representatives from Qingdao, Peiping, Jinhua, Hangzhou County, Wuxian, Jiangning, Shanghai, and other associations attended. Liu Liumin served as chairman and Dai Jixian served as recorder. First, the draft articles of association of the association were discussed and amended one by one, and then the research opinions sent by various lawyers' associations were collected together. After discussion by the representatives, it was agreed to send the copy of the articles of association and the research opinions sent by various associations to the representative office of Zhang Shishi, and ask Representative Zhang to organize the results and report to the association before August 1. Then, the Jiangning Association will schedule a meeting on August 12, and the meeting location will still be at the Shanghai Lawyers' Association. After the meeting, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Organizations Jointly Request Yang Hu and Others to Take Office Soon, Shanghai Branch Takes the Lead in Sending Telegrams</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union recently received a central government order to change to a system of chairman, unifying authority and promoting union affairs, which should be effective. It is heard that the seamen in this port have already taken the lead through the Shanghai Branch yesterday to send telegrams to the chairman Yang Hu, newly appointed preparatory committee members Wu Huan, Yang Donglin, etc., requesting them to take office and be responsible for the meeting as soon as possible. It is also heard that Yue Mingtai and others, members of the Tianjin Branch Preparatory Committee, came to Shanghai on official business a few days ago and were very pleased to hear this news. They have also sent telegrams urging them. The text of the telegram from Shanghai is specially recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Sanbei Opens New South China Shipping Route, Has Dispatched Four Ships to Operate, North China Ships Are Being Prepared</h3>
<p>Sanbei Company originally had no regular ships sailing in the North and South Oceans. Now, in order to expand its coastal shipping plan, it is adding regular liner services on the North and South Ocean routes. The company has been preparing for this for a long time. Now, it is starting with the South Ocean route first and has designated four ships to operate. North China ships are also being planned. The details are described separately below.</p>
<h3>Four Mountain Ships Sail to South China</h3>
<p>The Sanbei Company's seagoing ships, the Huashan, Taishan, Hengshan, and Mingshan, are the most popular.</p>
<p>The company has now designated them to operate</p>
<p>regular Shanghai to</p>
<p>Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou ships. Yesterday, the Hengshan left Shanghai, and the goods shipped to South China were fully loaded, mostly beans and flour. The Taishan has also been equipped with passenger compartments of various classes and carries passengers. This move by Sanbei is to compete in South China shipping and develop its coastal shipping routes.</p>
<h3>Warehouses Set Up in Guangdong and Other Places. Sanbei Company Aims to Stabilize Its South China Shipping Business.</h3>
<p>Specially built docks and warehouses in the four major ports of Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou to facilitate loading and unloading of passengers and goods.</p>
<p>The company is currently in the process of purchasing land for construction. In Guangdong, the company has first dispatched a large lighter to facilitate the storage of goods and the boarding and alighting of passengers. The lighter is named "Ping An" and has a very large capacity. It was towed by the Hengshan to Guangdong yesterday and anchored there.</p>
<h3>North China Route Also in Progress. As for the North China route, it was originally planned to open the route at the same time, and the route has been planned from Shanghai to Qingdao, Yantai, and Tianjin.</h3>
<p>Warehouses and docks for the ships Jing'an, Xinpu, and Songpu to operate in various places have also been actively planned. However, because the Jing'an is involved in a lawsuit that has not yet been resolved, and the North China Alliance is still in the trial stage, the dispatch of ships has been temporarily postponed, but it will soon be realized.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption from Shanghai Municipal Ship Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a request to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Communications, stating that the Chamber held its 5th Member Congress on June 17. According to the proposal of the Inland River Steamboat Association, the Chamber requested the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications to examine and act on the Executive Yuan's Order No. 3066, and separately instruct the Shanghai Municipal Government to promptly abolish the ship tax levied monthly by the Finance Bureau on cargo ships towed by steamboats, in order to avoid illegal double taxation. The proposal stated that since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government, its Finance Bureau has been levying monthly ship taxes on cargo ships operating or passing through the city's waterways, which has been a long-standing practice. Since the Ministry of Communications promulgated the Regulations on the Management of Tugs and Barges, all cargo ships towed by steamboats must comply with these regulations, apply to the Shanghai Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications for inspection and measurement, and submit an application to the Ministry for the issuance of a license, based on which they can report to the customs for loading. They must also pay customs tonnage dues, but the Finance Bureau does not automatically abolish the ship tax because the central government has separately established special regulations for these cargo ships, and even issues orders to stop operations if the tax payment is slightly delayed, which is a very strict procedure. The shipping companies believe that they have complied with the laws and regulations of the central government and should not be subject to double taxation, resulting in a situation of double taxation and an increase in additional burdens. According to Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Maritime Law and Articles 4 and 19 of the Shipping Law, all ships with a tonnage of more than 20 tons must apply to the central government's maritime authority for inspection and measurement and the issuance of a license. The cargo ships of the member bureau that are towed by steamboats are all over 20 tons and should comply with the Regulations on the Management of Tugs and Barges and apply to the Shanghai Navigation Bureau for inspection and issuance of tug and barge licenses. However, since the first day of this month, all cargo ships with tug and barge licenses must pay tonnage dues to the customs in accordance with the customs regulations when clearing customs at the Jianghai Customs, and must also pay ship taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau on a monthly basis, which is not abolished. Therefore, the same ship and cargo are subject to two taxes in the same place, which is contrary to the provisions of the Executive Yuan's Order No. 1449, which divides the management of navigation rights between the central and local governments. Moreover, in these days of decline in shipping business, how can they bear the burden of such redundant taxation? Furthermore, in mid-July of last year, the Executive Yuan issued Order No. 3066 to the provinces and municipalities, stating that local authorities should no longer levy fees on ships with a capacity of 20 tons or 200 piculs that have been legally registered and certified by the Navigation Bureau, so as to alleviate the difficulties of merchants with a single government order. Therefore, in accordance with the law and the facts, the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau should immediately abolish this monthly ship tax on cargo ships on its own, without any doubt. It is proposed that the Congress, based on the above reasons, prepare a document and submit it to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications to separately instruct the Shanghai Municipal Government to abolish all ship taxes levied by the Finance Bureau on cargo ships towed by steamboats that have already obtained tug and barge licenses from the Ministry of Communications, so as to maintain the shipping business with a maritime administration order. Is this appropriate? Please make a public decision, etc. The Congress discussed this matter and agreed that local authorities should not collect fees on ships that have been legally registered and certified by the Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. The Executive Yuan had issued an order to this effect early last year, and this Chamber had also submitted a request to prohibit the Zhejiang Province from illegally re-levying taxes. The situation in Zhejiang and Shanghai is the same, and it was found that the National Financial Conference considered all surtaxes on central taxes, or taxes that hinder the source of central revenue, or duplicate taxes that are the same as existing taxes, as exorbitant taxes that could be abolished. Since these cargo ships have paid tonnage dues to the central government, local authorities have no reason to require them to pay taxes again. It was decided that a request should be submitted to the government to abolish the ship tax in question. The matter is recorded and submitted for review and approval, and then transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Government for compliance with the Executive Yuan's order of last year to abolish the ship tax in question, so as to avoid double taxation and violate laws and regulations, which is in the public interest.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Municipal Council, Stating that Municipal Administration Should Adopt Citizens' Opinions, and Provide Full Consideration to Relevant Parties in Advance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Concession Industry and Commerce Bureau yesterday, stating, "Dear Sir, Our Chamber held its Fifth Member Congress on June 17. According to the proposals of the bicycle manufacturing and sales industry, ham industry, local goods industry, sandalwood and longan industry, and travel industry, the Municipal Council of the Concession should fully consider the opinions of relevant parties in advance for all facilities that have a major relationship with the business community, so as to achieve proper results. The proposal stated that the Municipal Council of the Concession has never given full consideration to the opinions of relevant parties in advance for all facilities. Once approved by the Council, it becomes an iron case, with no room for negotiation. The conflicts of interest often cause repercussions, and there are countless disputes in the past. In the future, for events of great importance to our business community, the Municipal Council should send the content of the event to the Chamber, notify the relevant business groups, and send representatives to make a thorough consideration to determine whether it is feasible or not. If necessary, these representatives may attend the relevant meetings of the Municipal Council to express their opinions, so as to facilitate overall planning, achieve proper results, avoid disputes, and benefit implementation. This is also beneficial to the Municipal Council and should be gladly accepted as a special proposal. We request that it be included in the agenda for discussion and implementation, etc. The Congress discussed this matter and agreed that the Municipal Government of this city previously discussed the implementation of business tax and first convened business leaders to discuss the methods many times in order to avoid misunderstandings. The Concession authorities should also expand the scope of this sincere and honest attitude and continue to adhere to it for events related to merchants, such as the changes in the methods for collecting license donations for the pawnshop industry last year, and invited representatives of the two industries to negotiate with each other in order to promote harmony between Chinese and foreigners. It was decided to send a letter to the Municipal Council stating that it should adopt opinions as much as possible in advance for municipal measures. We hereby record the matter and send a letter to your Bureau for reference and handling, and we will reply immediately."</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Sends Personnel to Persuade Workers of British American Tobacco Factory</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the strike at the British American Tobacco Company in Pudong has lasted for more than a month and has not yet been resolved. It is heard that the workers' side has decided to hold a banquet for all sectors of Shanghai tomorrow and invite them to organize a strike committee. The Pudong Native Place Association believes that the British American Tobacco workers' strike has been prolonged, affecting the Pudong market, which is no small matter. It also submitted a request to the Central Party Department, the National Government, and the Party and government organs of this city a few days ago, requesting that the company be ordered to quickly restore the factory in order to maintain the livelihoods of the workers. The words were very sincere. The Municipal Government also cares deeply about the unresolved British American Tobacco workers' strike. At 9 am yesterday, Zhu Guilin, a staff member of the Social Bureau, crossed the river to Pudong to persuade the workers to maintain order and wait for a solution. According to people in the strike committee, the responsibility for this strike is a matter of public opinion in all sectors of society, and there is no need to say more. However, it is rumored that the factory side recently wants to submit a request to the Party and government organs, asking them to order the withdrawal of the maintenance team of the Association outside the factory and on the wharf. It is not known that the maintenance team of this Association is entirely set up to maintain the order of the workers. Since the strike began, the order has been well maintained. If there is no maintenance team outside the factory and on the wharf, if there are troublemakers mixed into the factory and destroy the factory's property and attribute it to the Association, who can bear this injustice and responsibility? Furthermore, this strike of the Association was agreed by more than two-thirds of the representatives and cannot be transferred by any private opinions. In short, the Association has not had any incidents since the strike began on May 24, which can be comforted to all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Taisen Factory Shutdown Dispute, Workers Petition to Party and Government Yesterday</h3>

Dai Youheng of the People's Training Section and Wang Xianqing, director of the Third Section's Mediation, received them. The petition representatives first put forward two requests: (1) Order the factory to resume operations as soon as possible (2) Maintain the food supply for the workers before the dispute is resolved. Then, the two representatives Dai and Wang replied that they would order the factory to maintain the food supply, and hoped that the responsible representatives would persuade all the workers to wait quietly for a legal solution.</p>

<h3>Chief Ding of the Second District of the County Resigns, Assistant Li Youcai Succeeds</h3>

He has made considerable efforts in the district's administration. However, recently, due to the recurrence of an old illness, it is difficult to undertake the heavy tasks.

<h3>Case of a Dancer Abusing Her Adopted Daughter, Because the Adopted Daughter Does Not Want to Prosecute, the Court Rules That the Case Will Not Be Accepted</h3>
<p>Zhang Aizhen, also known as Zhang Aizhen, a local from Shanghai, aged 21, who was a dancer at the Dahu Dance Hall, lives at No. 6, Huai'an Lane, Baker Road. Three years ago, in Jiaxing, she spent 50 yuan to buy a girl named Xiaobao as her adopted daughter. Xiaobao is now six years old. Recently, she stole food and was beaten by Zhang with a chicken feather duster handle and bitten on the face. The China Child Welfare Association learned of this and believed that Zhang was inhumane, so it sent a representative, Zhao Jian, to report to the Xinzha Police Station. Detective Li Shizhong and Detective Ding Huaguo were dispatched to take Zhang Xiaobao to the police station and transfer her to the Child Welfare Association for temporary custody. At the same time, they reported to the First Special Court to issue a warrant, ordering Zhang Aizhen to appear in court for questioning. Zhang was extremely panicked after receiving the summons and secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide on the 17th of this month. Fortunately, it was discovered early and sent to the hospital for treatment, and she was able to recover. Yesterday morning, the trial was due to begin. Zhang Aizhen recovered and went to court with her lawyer. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the facts of the case and prosecuted her for serious injury under Article 294 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Zhang Aizhen admitted that she slightly punished Xiaobao for stealing food and playing with fire, and asked for leniency, and asked to be allowed to take Xiaobao back so that she could send her to school. Xiaobao also stated that she did not want to prosecute and was willing to go home with the defendant. Finally, the police lawyer argued that Xiaobao's injuries were undoubtedly there, but they were not serious and there was no danger to her life. It was not suitable for Article 294 of the Criminal Law and should be a minor injury under Article 293. However, Article 293 is a crime that is prosecuted upon complaint. Now that Xiaobao has stated that she does not want to prosecute, she should be informed that it will not be accepted. As for whether Xiaobao should be taken back by the defendant or by the Child Welfare Association, please consider it. The defendant's lawyer also stood up and argued. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the confession and ruled in court that the case would not be accepted. Zhang Xiaobao was allowed to be taken back by Zhang Aizhen for proper care and must not be treated again.</p>
<h3>A Madman Kills His Father, Qian Bingyi is Sent to a Mental Hospital</h3>

He stayed at home all day long, talking to himself, and recently his nerves were disordered and his actions changed drastically. At about 9 pm the night before, the family was cooling off in front of the door when Bingyi suddenly had an argument with his father for some reason. Bingyi ran into the room, holding a kitchen knife and a wooden stick in each hand, and chopped and struck his parents indiscriminately. Fortunately, Mr. and Mrs. Bingyi quickly evaded and were not killed or injured. Later, Police Officer Xu Xuemeng of the police station reported to the police and came to help twist him up and brought him back to the station along with the knives and sticks. After Director Bi briefly questioned him, the defendant denied the murder, but he did not answer the questions asked. He was ordered to be temporarily detained and sent to a mental hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Li Ruizhen Arrested for Extorting Boatmen and Secretly Sabotaging, Taken to the Public Security Bureau for Investigation, Using a Lawyer to Defraud Money</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to maintain traffic and local security on the unpaved road west of the new garbage bridge on Suzhou Creek, ordered Xu Chizhi, the patrol officer of the Second Squadron of the Water Patrol Team, to lead the police to investigate the population of the poor boatmen living along the banks of the river a few days ago and to persuade them to register, which caused the boatmen to misunderstand and gather more than a thousand people. A conflict occurred with the police officers, and even bricks were thrown, injuring Patrol Officer Xu and Police Officer Du Wenguang and others. Details have been published in this newspaper. It is learned that Li Ruizhen, nicknamed "Jiangbei Tycoon" (that is, Li Wenbao), had impersonated a water patrol team inspector and used the name of lawyer Zhang Shewo to falsely claim that he had hired Zhang as a legal advisor. He distributed advisor licenses, which were stamped with Li Ruizhen's seal. It is said that he collected monthly fees from first-class boatmen of 2 yuan and 4 cents, second-class boatmen 2 yuan, third-class boatmen 1 yuan and 6 cents, and fourth-class boatmen 8 cents, and claimed to be the representative of the boatmen and secretly sabotage.

He was sent to the Third Section of the General Bureau yesterday morning to be dealt with according to the law.</p>

<p>Li Shunrong, a native of Changshu, who lives at No. 18, Puqing Lane, Beihai Road, Public Concession, is 28 years old this year. He recently made a living by selling the poisonous drug red pills. At about 6 pm on the 23rd, he was carrying three cloth bags of red pills, totaling 3,000 pills, when he passed the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Avenue de Miolnis in the French Concession.

The detectives then took Li to the address and arrested Wang Lu (38 years old, a maid). She confessed that the red pills belonged to her master, Yang Xiaomao, and were hidden in the kitchen shed at No. 27 in the same alley. The detectives then went to the house and searched two white leather suitcases, which contained 61 cloth bags of red pills, totaling 61,000 pills. However, Yang had already fled upon hearing the news. The detectives took Li and Lu and the evidence back to the police station and sent them to the Second Special District Court yesterday. Judge Wang Gangxu took the seat in the First Criminal Court for trial. First, Police Lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the facts of the case and prosecuted them under Article 6 of the Opium Suppression Law. Then, Detective Wang Dongwan reported the arrest of the two defendants and the process of searching for evidence and presented the evidence to the court. When questioned, Li Shunrong confessed that he had bought the red pills to be smoked by his 63-year-old father and had also bought a bag last month. Wang Lu confessed that she had been helping Yang Xiaomao, a native of Shanbei, for only four or five days and that Yang had asked her to sell the red pills for a daily wage of 1 yuan. She did not know where Yang was now. The court reviewed the confession and announced the end of the trial, scheduling the sentencing for the 29th. The defendants were taken back to custody.</p>

The asphalt on the roads melted everywhere. A group of coolies and rickshaw pullers were all complaining. Cold drink shops were full of customers and made three times the profit. At noon, the Fahrenheit thermometer reached 101.5 degrees. Although there was a slight breeze, it failed to reduce the heat, but instead felt hot and smoky. After 6 pm, it was slightly cooler. A group of civilians gathered at the crossroads, naked to cool off. The swimming pools were also full. It was the first time this year that it was so hot in this city since the beginning of summer.

<h3>Chinese Concession Telephones Should Switch to Direct Dialing: Trade Associations Request Chamber of Commerce to Intervene</h3>
<p>The various trade associations of the wood industry, timber industry, flour milling industry, bamboo industry, sugar industry, cattle and sheep industry, etc. of this city, yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it negotiate for the Chinese Concession telephones to be switched to direct dialing as soon as possible. The letter stated: "We respectfully submit that the telephone business is a public utility, with the responsibility of facilitating communication. It is different from ordinary businesses that aim to make a profit. Therefore, governments of all countries supervise it strictly, and everything is done to facilitate commercial interactions. The Shanghai Telephone Company and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau are both transportation agencies within the Shanghai area. However, due to the separation of the Chinese Concession, each call abandons the convenience of automatic machinery and relies on manual switching. Furthermore, a fee of five cents is charged for each call, which increases the extra burden on users and goes against the duty of facilitating communication. The members of our associations have frequent commercial interactions and suffer greatly from this inconvenience. Therefore, we specifically send this joint letter to your esteemed chamber, requesting that you forward a letter to the Ministry of Communications to negotiate with the concession telephone company, and to send a letter to the Public Works Department to urge them to handle the matter. Additionally, please send a letter to the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, urging them to immediately plan the communication facilities between the Chinese Concession and the concession, and to switch to direct dialing in the shortest possible time, in order to facilitate communication and promote commercial prosperity. We would be most grateful." Addressed to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Detective Lu Baoshan of the Detective Team Assassinated: Repeatedly Solved Theft Cases, Suffered Revengeful Calculation; Impoverished After Death, Funds Raised for Funeral Expenses</h3>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, Lu Baoshan, an Anhui native, was 34 years old. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, he served in the 88th Division. Later, through introductions, he joined the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau as a detective. He lived with his wife, Madam Lu Feng, a Kunshan native (28 years old), on the upper floor of the Liu Hongtai brush shop at No. 63 Zhaozhou Road, Xieqiao North, Nanshi. This spring, he was assigned to the second district of Ximen with detective Fang Lingen to carry out detective and arrest work. At 9:15 PM the night before last, Lu Baoshan went to the Qixinglou teahouse opened by his fellow villager, Madam Chen Zheng, at No. 3289 Kangqu Road, Gaochang Temple, to have tea. Two thugs opened fire, hitting him in the left abdomen. The bullet did not pass through. He was still able to endure the pain and exit through the back door, cross the bamboo fence, and hide in the attic at No. 6 Hexing Lane, where he died due to his injuries. It is understood that Lu Baoshan cracked the case of the habitual thief Shang Ziqin at No. 81 Longhua Road on January 12th of this year, as well as a theft case in Kunshan, and cracked the red pill distribution network in Nanshi, which led to his assassination by fugitive bandits. It is reported that the deceased's parents, sisters, and siblings are all in his original hometown in Anhui. He only had his wife, Lu Feng, in Shanghai, and no children. He was impoverished after his death. The detective leader, Shen Wenda, reported the situation to the detective team leader, Lu Ying, and the district chief, Li Jing, who mutually donated funds and ordered the local security to report to the court. After the autopsy at 3:00 PM yesterday, the body was collected for burial. An order was issued to subordinates to strictly investigate the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Products Company Opens New Ninety-Eight Emporium</h3>
<p>Across from the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road, the Shanghai National Products Company, managed by Mr. Wu Zhihao and Mr. Lu Qisheng, has always upheld the principle of promoting national products. They have greatly sacrificed profits for all kinds of goods. It is heard that the two gentlemen believe that as the summer season is approaching, there will be a large demand for summer goods from all sectors of society. Therefore, starting today, they are opening a new Ninety-Eight Emporium near the Children's Paradise on the second floor of the company. It opens today.

<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Telegraph Training to Switch to Auditory System</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that in recent years, railway telegraphs in various countries have mostly adopted listening devices, which are convenient for receiving and transmitting messages as they are heard and recorded. It has specially ordered all railways to implement the abolition of telegraph paper strips and switch to the auditory system by July 1st of next year. It has also ordered that all telegraph personnel be trained within this one-year period. Initially, the two railways, the Beijing-</p>
<h3>Police Officer Disassembles Gun, Bullet Flies Out and Kills Youth: Only One Bullet, But Abdomen Pierced with Seven Holes; Zhu Jialu Dies from Unexpected Disaster</h3>
<p>Zhu Jialu, an 18-year-old employee of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant from Suzhou, lived in the dormitory provided by the plant at No. 838, Talas Tor Road. On the evening of the 13th of this month, Zhu was casually looking out at the doorway after dinner when a police officer on duty, Lin Yunchu, whom he knew well, joked with a group of young people and disassembled the gun to look at it. Unexpectedly, a bullet flew out and hit Zhu in the abdomen. After the incident, Zhu was unconscious. His colleagues reported it to the Fifth District Police Station. In addition to escorting Lin to the headquarters for investigation, Zhu was sent to Fumin Hospital for treatment. After the doctor's autopsy, it was surprisingly found that although there was only one bullet, his abdomen was pierced with seven holes, leading to his death. The body was sent to the China Funeral Home for burial by the employees of the company and his father, Zhu Jingju. Yesterday, before the burial, the family reported to the local court for an examination. Prosecutor Zhao and others were commissioned to come to the scene to verify the situation and ordered a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Line telegraph work has been using the auditory system, and the results are very good. However, the stations on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line still use the old system, relying on paper strips to record telegraph codes. Now, the Traffic Department has drafted training methods, which are scheduled to begin on July 1st of this year and be completed within one year. The plan has been approved by the railway bureau and is now recorded as follows: (1) All station masters and telegraph personnel of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo stations should use existing paper strip telegraph machines to temporarily imitate the sound methods of the Beijing-Shanghai Line auditory machines to practice receiving and recording telegrams. (2) When practicing, all related personnel must concentrate on listening and recording, but on the one hand, paper strips can still be used as a record, so that after work, the sound obtained by listening can be compared with the paper strips to clarify the results of listening and receiving. (3) The above training should be for a period of three months, starting from July 1st of this year, and all stations on the entire line will start training uniformly until September 30th of this year. (4) The section chiefs of each traffic section shall be responsible for the guidance, supervision, and assessment of the auditory system training of all related personnel under their jurisdiction. (5) The section chiefs of each traffic section shall assess the performance of the trainees under their jurisdiction once a month and submit the assessment results to the department for record. (6) Assessment standards: Those who can receive and send 15 Chinese characters per minute are considered qualified, and those who can receive and send 20 characters per minute are considered excellent. (7) At the end of the training period, the section chiefs of each traffic section or personnel additionally appointed by the department will jointly conduct an examination with the section chiefs of each traffic section. Those with excellent results will be given appropriate commendations, and those who fail will be given a strict warning and may be given a grace period of half a month to continue practicing. After the grace period, the competent section chiefs or personnel additionally appointed by the department will jointly conduct another examination, and the results will be submitted to the department for review. (8) The date for the official implementation of full-line training will be determined separately by this department.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Industry Establishes Free Clinic and Medicine Distribution Center for Rickshaw Pullers: New Village Hospital Remains Undefined</h3>
<p>In order to help rickshaw pullers, the Rickshaw Industry Association of the Special District of this city resolved at the rickshaw owners' meeting to establish a new village hospital for rickshaw pullers, etc. The association resolved at its 34th board meeting yesterday to first establish five medicine distribution centers, located on Lloyd Road, East Jiaxing Road, Zhabei, Caojiadu, and Tangjiawan. In addition to providing diagnosis and medicine, there are also tea pavilions, etc. They are scheduled to open on July 1st. The association has specially sent a letter to the National Medical Association and the Shenzhou Medical Association to hold examinations for physicians. As for the new village hospital, it will be established after the attached economic committee decides on it. In addition, six rickshaw pullers jointly submitted a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting an order to reduce rent. According to Mr. Gu Cunmao, a director of the association, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce had submitted the original letter, but after inquiring with rickshaw owners, none of them knew these workers. It is clearly a fabrication. However, rickshaw owners are also not well-off with the expenses of the equipment on the rickshaws. In order to care for the suffering of the workers, they have also made some reductions. The ongoing new village hospital and medicine distribution center are purely for the purpose of helping rickshaw pullers. Therefore, the genuine rickshaw pullers generally agree with the rickshaw owners' measures.</p>
<h3>German Merchants' Trademark Exclusive Rights Expire: Trademark Bureau Urges Continued Registration; Otherwise, Exclusive Rights Will Be Revoked; Yesterday's Letter to the German Chamber of Commerce for Reference</h3>
<p>Mr. He Zhuoxian, Director of the Trademark Bureau, stated that according to Article 16 of the old Trademark Law, the exclusive period for trademarks registered by German manufacturers in our country is based on the period originally stipulated in the country of registration, but may not exceed 20 years. The exclusive period stipulated by the German Trademark Law is ten years, and the exclusive period for trademarks registered by German merchants during the Beijing government era according to the old Trademark Law was also ten years. Most of them have now expired. The Trademark Bureau has specially sent a letter to the German Chamber of Commerce in this city regarding this matter, requesting that it inform them to continue registration. The original letter is recorded as follows: "We respectfully submit that Article 16 of the Trademark Law stipulates: 'The exclusive period of a trademark shall be limited to twenty years from the date of registration.' 'The exclusive period mentioned above may be extended upon application in accordance with the provisions of this law, but each time shall still be limited to twenty years.' However, Article 16, Paragraph 2 of the old Trademark Law states: 'If a trademark registered in a foreign country as stipulated in Article 6 is applied for registration, the exclusive period shall be based on the period originally stipulated in the country of registration, but may not exceed twenty years.' It is now found that the exclusive period for trademarks in your country is set at ten years, and the exclusive period for trademarks registered by your companies in our bureau in accordance with the old Trademark Law is limited to ten years. This type of trademark, if registered earlier, has now expired. Unless an application for renewal of registration is submitted in accordance with the law, it cannot continue to be used exclusively. Currently, there are many trademark holders who have applied for renewal of expired trademarks in accordance with the law, but the majority have not complied with the application. If the expired trademark is not applied for renewal, its exclusive rights will expire accordingly. In the future, if other businesses apply to register the same or similar trademarks, or if there are cases of counterfeiting, they cannot be protected legally. The Trademark Bureau is sincerely afraid that the merchants may not understand the law and miss the opportunity. In addition to publishing the above situation in the Trademark Gazette for public announcement, we specially send this letter to your chamber, please check and inform the overseas merchants to quickly come to the bureau to apply for renewal of expired trademarks that have not been renewed, so as to be cautious. Sincerely, Director of the Trademark Bureau, He Zhuoxian, addressed to the Shanghai German Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<h3>Rent Dispute in Xicheng Lane Heard Yesterday: Landlord Sends Personnel to Investigate the Truth; Tenants Hold General Meeting Yesterday to Discuss</h3>
<p>The rent dispute in Xicheng Lane, at the intersection of Ximen Road and Malong Road in the French Concession, due to the Yiyuan Company Management Office, the landlord, forcing tenants to sign harsh contracts, has been going on for many days. Although the court ruled that the contract should be cancelled, the landlord, in addition to appealing, still sent personnel to force the tenants to sign the contract, all of which were rejected by the tenants. On the one hand, the tenants, believing that the landlord was disregarding the court's ruling and oppressing them, have separately entrusted five lawyers, including Wu Kaisheng and Zhu Yakui, to file a counterclaim. On the other hand, the branch of the Fourth Division of the City Federation in the lane sent a letter of warning, urging them to respect the court's ruling and immediately stop any further coercion to sign contracts. It is heard that the landlord, Sun Chuanfang, is currently in Tianjin. Upon hearing this news, he sent a representative, Mr. Yao, to Shanghai a few days ago to investigate the cause of the dispute and mediate. He met with the representatives of the lane, Li Ruzhang and Yao Xingyuan, etc., the day before yesterday, inquiring about everything in detail. The lane representatives described in detail the unreasonable harassment of the tenants by the management office and requested the landlord: (1) to replace the management office, (2) to resolve the issue of compensation for the damaged tenants, and (3) to handle everything as it was when it was managed by Qian Yipin, etc. The representative agreed to return to Tianjin immediately to report to the landlord for a reply. The lane branch, in order to deal with the situation in a unified manner and seek a solution as soon as possible, convened a temporary general meeting of all members at Anxin Temple at 8:00 PM yesterday, attended by more than a hundred people. It was chaired by Li Ruzhang and recorded by Yu Jingqing. After reporting on the situation of the landlord sending personnel to Shanghai for investigation, they discussed the coping strategies and resolved as follows: (1) The illegal actions of the management office have disturbed the tenants. They unanimously demand that it be replaced. (2) If the landlord has sincerity in mediation, the whole body expresses acceptance. (3) It was found that the management office recently sent personnel to 36 households to coerce and intimidate them into signing the original contract, and there was an incident of beating Yao Xingyuan, the standing member of this association. In addition to commissioning a lawyer to file a counterclaim, this association will send a letter of warning. (4) Entrust Lawyer Wu et al. to publish a statement in the newspaper stating that the 91 households that were forced to sign the contract are declared invalid according to the court's ruling. (5) Demand that the landlord implement the restoration of the rent payment at the level of 19 years as soon as possible in order to lighten the burden. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3>Co-owner of Tofu Shop Hangs Himself Due to Poor Business</h3>
<p>Lu Quansheng, a man from Pudong, aged fifty-eight, opened a Changxingzhai tofu shop at No. 124 Changping Road. He had been in business for many years, but recently business had been unusually slow, while expenses had been increasing without end. As a result, the shop suffered significant losses. Lu, after much thought, felt that the future was bleak and that he could not continue. Yesterday, his resentment grew even stronger, and he suddenly conceived the idea of ending his life. He went to the rooftop without anyone knowing and hanged himself. Later, an apprentice, Zhang Liushan, caught a glimpse of him and was shocked. He immediately ran to inform the young owner, Lu Atu, who, together with Zhang, tried to take him down, but his breath was already faint. They were unable to save him and sent him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he soon died. The hospital reported to the Gordon Road police station, which ordered detective Li Bochuan to investigate. The body was then taken to the mortuary on Fielun Road for examination. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court dispatched Prosecutor Diao Chengtang, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuji, to the mortuary. After examining the body and questioning Lu Atu, who claimed to be thirty-two years old, he stated, "The deceased is my father.

<p>(1) After Joining the Reading Guidance Department</p>
<p>This is a letter from a reader. He tells us about his experience of joining our department and his self-study situation. He is very hardworking and has achieved considerable success step by step. This sincere attitude and the spirit of hardworking self-encouragement are worthy of admiration. Therefore, we have published an abstract of his letter below for our classmates' reference.</p>
<p>"In these two months, I have corresponded with you five times, and you have always replied to me sincerely. Now, in order to live up to your expectations, I will report to you my joining process and my self-study situation after joining.</p>
<p>This year, my store subscribed to a copy of your newspaper in March, and I had the opportunity to read the newspaper. When I turned to the end of the fourth page, I suddenly saw "Reading Q&amp;A", which aroused my special interest. After reading several pages in a row, I was extremely satisfied with your answers to readers' questions. Therefore, I was also prompted to join the correspondence, and after reading your reply, I was really overjoyed. Soon, I officially became your student, and my private life changed because of it.</p>
<p>In today's stores, an apprentice is not allowed to do anything other than business, not to mention that generally speaking, apprentices have no private life, and all leisure time must be deprived. In the first year I entered the store, I never read a page of books or a newspaper. This is not to say that I didn't even have time to read a page of books, because the boss was unhappy that the apprentices still remembered their studies and recalled school life. I used to be very desperate. A year later, I saw that I was not the only one suffering the same pain. We all discussed that we should work hard on official matters, pay attention, be agile, and be economical, but at the same time, the boss cannot manage our private lives and must allow us to read and entertain. At first, he naturally did not agree, but later he saw that we were all united and there were no mistakes in the store affairs, so he said nothing. This time, three of us participated in the guidance department, and we can all have time for self-study now. This is my overcoming of the current environment.</p>
<p>As for the method of self-study, this is entirely what you have given us in the past two months. I should thank you very much. I remember that in the first communication, I opened five or sixty kinds of books and more than ten kinds of subjects and asked you for guidance, but you deleted forty books for me and told me not to be too ambitious, but to read one book at a time in a practical way. I am proceeding according to your guidance. I used to practice writing every night, but after reading "The Uselessness of Practicing Writing", I also changed to reading social sciences. In February, I have finished reading the Outline of Social Problems. I took two notebooks. Now I feel that I should follow the various parts of the Outline of Social Problems and study further. Now I have decided to read it one by one. Within a year, I want to gain a basic knowledge of the overall knowledge of social problems. I am very confident that this method is correct. This has increased my courage to learn a lot. In the past, because of the environment and age, I often worried about not being able to read all the books in the world, and therefore could not be erudite. Now this mystery has been dispelled. (2) Weekly Information</p>
<h3>1. Reader Communication Stationery Now on Sale</h3>
<p>Reader communication stationery is now printed. Each book is packed with a hundred sheets and only costs two dimes of ocean currency. It is sold at the toll booth of this library. In the future, readers' correspondence is hoped to use this stationery, because from August 1st, this library will not reply to those who do not use this stationery. On the stationery, we have printed the name, registration number, number of communications, correspondence address, nature of the problem, etc. Readers must first fill in the form when writing a letter, so as not to forget to fill it in when sending the letter, because this can save us a lot of registration procedures and facilitate statistical application. In the reader's side, there is no loss at all.</p>
<h3>2. Book Borrowing Extension Up to One Month</h3>
<p>The borrowing of books in this library is limited to one week according to the regulations. There are many books with difficult content and many pages. Readers often feel that the deadline has passed and they cannot finish reading. It is very inconvenient to borrow again because the library does not allow it. Now we have set a flexible method and designated some books that can be extended for two or three times to one month. However, if readers want to extend the loan, they must still come to the library to declare and go through the extension procedures when the loan is due.</p>
<h3>3. Out-of-Town Postal Borrowing</h3>
<p>This library's borrowing of books by mail from other places was originally limited to readers of this library who are away from Shanghai. Not long</p>
<p>ago, we received many enthusiastic reading friends from other places who asked to expand to other places. In order to find a compromise, this library can make flexible arrangements for friends from other places who have joined the reading guidance department. If you need this library to provide book borrowing, this library can make flexible arrangements to borrow books by mail, and this method will be used as a temporary trial. Therefore, all of you who have joined this department, as long as you communicate with us regularly, can send a letter to apply. If the review is qualified, we can introduce you to the postal borrowing department.</p>
<h3>4. Conversation Time Change</h3>
<p>The time we agreed with readers to talk</p>
<p>, was previously set on Sundays. Now, because many readers are not free on Sundays, the time has been specially changed to 1:00 to 2:00 PM on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. All of you who have received this library's letter of invitation to talk, please come to the library for a face-to-face conversation in accordance with the newly revised time. No further notice will be given.</p>
<h3>5. Welcome Readers to Provide Short Manuscripts on Self-Study Experience - About Self-Study Experience</h3>
<p>We think it is very precious, and readers must be very interested in knowing other people's experiences. Now we plan to open a special column in the Reader News to often publish this kind of stuff. We hope that readers will provide short manuscripts of no more than 500 words, and readers' self-study environments are different, and each person writes out their own self-study process, and they will definitely gain the benefit of mutual discussion. However, this journal is for the use of the guidance department and like-minded friends to report to readers, so for the writers, everything is based on like-mindedness, so no manuscript fees are paid.</p>

<h3>Zhou Fo-hai on the Establishment of Secondary Education in Jiangsu (I) !Speech at the Provincial Government's Weekly Memorial Meeting!</h3>
<p>Chairman, fellow comrades, today, taking advantage of the Memorial Week opportunity, I will specially give you a brief report on the establishment of secondary education in Jiangsu Province. If there are opportunities in the future, I may report to you separately on primary education and social education, so that you will have a clear understanding of the entire education system in Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>Before reporting on secondary education in Jiangsu Province, I would also like to briefly explain the trend of secondary education in the whole country to everyone. Originally, secondary education includes three parts: middle school, normal school, and vocational school. These three types of education have their own goals, and the amount of their establishment should be determined based on the needs of the environment. One should not pay special attention to one item and neglect the others. However, the actual situation is not like this. The trend of secondary education in the whole country is that middle schools are particularly inflated, while normal schools and vocational schools are less developed. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the nineteenth year of the Republic (1930), the number of ordinary middle schools in the country accounts for about two-thirds of the total number of secondary schools, the amount of funding accounts for about three-quarters, and the number of students exceeds two-fifths. However, the number of vocational schools is less than one-tenth, the amount of funding is only one-tenth, and the number of students is less than 7%. It can be seen that this kind of deformed development is a consistent phenomenon throughout the country. Therefore, the way out for middle school graduates has become a major problem. Because the curriculum of Chinese middle schools is specially designed for students to go to higher education, and many graduates cannot go to higher education due to economic and family circumstances, especially in recent years, with the bankruptcy of the rural economy in various places, there are even more middle school graduates who cannot go to higher education. These many students who cannot go to higher education have learned some general science in school, have no production skills, that is, have no ability to live independently. They are unwilling to sit at home and eat, and they want to pretend to be sophisticated and have a high status, and are unwilling to engage in labor. Children from farming families do not want to be farmers after entering school, and children from working families do not want to be workers after entering school. The only way is to run to the cities, compete for opportunities, and seek a way out. The lucky ones may find a small position in various institutions, or find a teacher in a primary school. The unlucky ones drift around, have nowhere to go, or even become desperate and take risks, doing many things that disturb society and endanger the country. The more graduates from schools, the more floating elements in society, and the more the number of productive elements in society decreases. If this continues, isn't it a great danger to the future of the country and society? In recent years, the Ministry of Education has regarded this point as very serious, and has stipulated various methods to limit the inflation of ordinary middle schools and promote the development of vocational schools. The most important method is to stipulate the percentage of funding occupied by ordinary middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools in secondary education, that is, ordinary middle schools account for 40%, normal schools account for 25%, and vocational schools account for 35%. An order was issued to all provinces to allocate all funds in accordance with this regulation, in order to gradually reverse this trend of deformed development.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that secondary education in Jiangsu Province is relatively developed. The number of public and private secondary schools has reached more than 190, not including unregistered private schools. In terms of funding, excluding county-run and private schools, the funding for provincial secondary schools alone has reached more than two million yuan. This is not a small amount in the eyes of various provinces. Since I came to Jiangsu, I have associated the development of the quantity of secondary education in Jiangsu Province with the question of whether it is all needed by facts. I have held a skeptical attitude towards this question from the beginning. Therefore, in recent years, on the one hand, I have tried to rectify the content of existing public and private secondary schools and improve their level, such as investigating the equipment of libraries, instruments, and specimens in various schools, and issuing teaching progress tables for each subject and the minimum equipment standards for subjects such as botany and zoology. These are all efforts to consolidate the established facts. On the other hand, in provincial schools with better equipment and suitable environment, such as Suzhong, Yangzhong, and Shangzhong schools, either vocational subjects are added, or the funding for vocational subjects is increased. In addition, the Su Gong, which had been closed, was restored, and the Suqian Middle School was changed to a glass vocational school. The Yixing Public Vocational School was taken over by the province and changed to Yixing Ceramics Vocational School and Yixing Senior Agricultural and Forestry Vocational School, respectively. And for private schools requesting registration, special caution is taken and they are not easily approved. All these methods are based on a skeptical attitude towards the development of the quantity of secondary schools. However, I am afraid that personal doubts may not be entirely correct, so I try to conduct various statistics to obtain factual basis. The survey statistics on the supply and demand of teachers in the province have long been completed, and the statistics on the way out for secondary school graduates in the province have also been largely completed. According to the survey statistics on the supply and demand of teachers in the province, there are a total of 23,304 primary school teachers in the province, 17,435 qualified and 5,869 unqualified. And the provincial and county normal schools are expected to have 6,209 graduates by the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), which is more than enough to replace unqualified teachers. If unqualified teachers cannot be completely replaced, then these normal school graduates will have more difficulty finding positions. This is the result of observing the whole. If we observe from the perspective of parts, the number of normal school graduates in the province in the 21st and 22nd years of the Republic (1932-1933) was 4,128, while the number of teachers to be increased for the promotion of primary schools in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933) was only 962. It is estimated that the number of unqualified teachers to be replaced is only 1,350. Based on a comprehensive calculation, almost half of the normal school graduates will not be able to find positions in these two years. Furthermore, from the perspective of senior high school normal departments, in the 21st and 22nd years of the Republic (1932-1933), the total number of graduates from senior high school normal departments in the province was 1,393, while the total number of senior primary school classes promoted in the province in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933) was only 53. Even if these 53 classes are all handled by graduates of senior high school normal departments, it is a phenomenon of more than 20 people jointly running one class. From this, it can be seen that from any perspective, there is an oversupply of primary school teachers in the province. Furthermore, according to the statistics on the way out for secondary school graduates in the province, the total number of graduates from ordinary senior high school departments in the province in the 21st year of the Republic (1932) was 803, of which 547 went on to higher education, accounting for 68% of the total. There were still 42% who failed to go to higher education. Although the total number of junior high school graduates has not yet been fully counted by a small number of schools and cannot be statistically calculated, according to the schools that have arrived, it is estimated that only about 70% went on to higher education, and those who could not go to higher education were also within 30%. In total, the number of high and junior high school students who cannot go to higher education is not small. Based on these two aspects of statistics, I am deeply convinced that in the aspect of secondary education in Jiangsu Province, not only can ordinary middle schools not be arbitrarily inflated, but also normal schools should try to compress. Compared with other provinces that only need to compress a part of middle schools, it is even more difficult to carry out. Fortunately, I just got out of it, and I had noticed this early. Therefore, in terms of provincial secondary schools, I want to make all kinds of education just the right amount and have appropriate development. It is still easier to do. This is a point that I feel gratified about.</p>
<h3>This City's Summer Military Training Tentatively Scheduled to Begin on July 1 ▲National Military Training Association Convened a Meeting of Instructors from Various Schools Yesterday ▲Students Who Have Already Left School Will Hold It Before the Start of School</h3>
<p>This city's summer military training for schools above the high school level, after the Municipal Education Bureau and the Municipal National Military Training Committee planned to handle it, the committee convened a meeting of military instructors from various schools at 2:00 p.m. yesterday.

Immediately discussed, (1) Regarding the starting date of the summer military training, it is tentatively scheduled to start on July 1, but for a few schools where students have already left school, it will be held before the start of school, starting on August 20. (2) Training location, because there are too many people in this city and there are no suitable barracks to gather, so except for a few schools that are close to each other, the method of dividing the area is adopted. Schools are used as units and converted into temporary barracks. (3) Military instructors are not enough to be allocated, and a request has been submitted to the Garrison Command to allocate them. (4) The food expenses will be handled by the schools. The above methods still need to be submitted to the Education Bureau for approval before implementation, it is said.</p>

<h3>Three Academic Societies of Geography, Botany, and Zoology Participate in the Annual Meeting of the Science Society of China ▲Held in Guling Starting on August 21 ▲Two Committees of Theses and Lectures Are Working Hard</h3>
<p>The 19th annual meeting of the Science Society of China has long been decided to be held in Guling, Jiangxi, and Yang Yunzhong, Cheng Bolu and other six people have been appointed as the preparatory committee. The date of the annual meeting was originally scheduled to start on August 16 and last for six days, only because the number of tourists to Lushan this year is extremely crowded and it is difficult to find a house. Recently, Lian Gu Qingnian has been rented, and all meeting places will be the venue for the annual meeting. However, it was rented by other groups before August 20, so the preparatory committee has decided to reschedule the meeting to start on August 21. The two committees of theses and lectures of the association are now working hard. In terms of theses, more than 80 articles have been submitted. The lectures are divided into the middle school science education group and the production and construction group. Held in Nanchang, the members of the society have expressed their willingness to participate in the annual meeting very enthusiastically. During this session, three academic organizations, including the Chinese Botanical Society, the Chinese Zoological Society, and the Chinese Geographical Society, will jointly participate in the joint annual meeting. The liaison of domestic academic organizations will be the beginning of this year, it is said.</p>
<h3>Educational Bureaus of Various Counties in Jiangsu Demand Guarantee of Independent Funding ▲The Measures Promulgated by the Department of Finance Overturn the Original Plan of Independence ▲Telegram Requesting Submission to the Provincial Government for Review to Comply with Laws and Regulations</h3>
<p>Since the Department of Finance of Jiangsu Province collected the county surtax and other funds and stored them in the county treasury designated by the provincial government from the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), all expenses have been reviewed and signed by the county magistrate, chief accountant, and director of property. The educational authorities of various counties believe that this move by the Department of Finance violates the internal affairs and party program of the late Premier and the central laws and regulations, endangering the independence of educational funding. Therefore, they jointly telegraphed the party and government organs of Jiangsu Province to appeal for separate storage in order to maintain the spirit of independent educational funding. The original telegrams to the province and counties are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Telegram to Provincial Party and Government Organs</h3>
<p>Special Commissioner Li of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Director Zhao of the Department of Finance, and Director Zhou of the Department of Education Junjian, the Department of Finance issued orders to various counties on the measures for the receipt, expenditure, storage, and deposit of public funds, ordering them to be implemented on July 1. These measures are found to be inconsistent with Article 13 of the internal affairs and party program of the late Premier and the National Government's Order No. 123 and the Executive Yuan's Order No. 374. In accordance with Article 2 of the Provincial Government Organization Measures, the provincial single regulations and procedures are limited to not conflicting with central laws and regulations. The educational funding of various counties in Jiangsu Province has long been implemented with independent accounting in accordance with the 14 measures promulgated by the Executive Yuan, with remarkable results. The measures promulgated by the Department of Finance this time overturn the original plan of independence and clearly violate central laws and regulations. It should be submitted to the Provincial Government for review, and the educational funding should be excluded from the scope of the measures in order to respect the legacy and comply with laws and regulations. In addition to detailed explanations, we respectfully telegraph the text. Zhu Zhaosheng and other directors and section chiefs of the education bureaus of Songjiang, Jiading, Taicang, Nanhui, Shanghai, Fengxian, Kunshan, Jinshan, Qingpu, Changshu, Chongming, Wuxian, Baoshan, Jiangdu, Jiangyin, Chuansha, Wujin counties kowtow.</p>
<h3>Another Telegram to Various County Governments</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Junjian, the Department of Finance issued an order this time on the county fund collection and expenditure</p>
<p>Storage measures, ordered to be implemented from July 1, should be followed. However, it is found that these measures are clearly inconsistent with Article 13 of the late Premier's Party Program, the National Government's Order No. 123, and the Executive Yuan's Order No. 374, which guarantee the independence of educational funding. In accordance with Article 2 of the Provincial Government Organization Law, the provincial orders and provincial single measures are limited to not conflicting with central laws and regulations. These measures overturn the final decision on the independence of educational funding and clearly violate central laws and regulations. A request has been submitted to the provincial government for review to exclude educational funding from the scope of the measures in order to respect the legacy and comply with laws and regulations. It is appropriate to telegraph to Junzhang to temporarily suspend the implementation in order to avoid causing disputes. Education is very fortunate. Zhu Zhaosheng and other directors and section chiefs of the education bureaus of Songjiang, Jiangdu, Changshu, Fengxian, Jiangyin, Taicang, Chongming, Nanhui, Shanghai, Wujin, Kunshan, Wuxian, Jiading, Jinshan, Qingpu, Chuansha, Baoshan and other counties kowtow.</p>

<h3>National Shanghai Medical College</h3>

Mayor Wu Tiecheng, representatives of the Department of Health Quan Baoshan, Li Ting'an, Cai Zengji, Huang Renzhi, Ma Fengqi, and more than 50 guests attended. After the ceremony was held as usual, President Yan Fuqing briefly described the graduation process, followed by a speech by Quan Baoshan, briefly stating that the hard work of the students over the years can be contributed to society. It is deeply gratifying. The way to save the country, although there are many, the health of the people is the most important. 85% of China's population lives in the countryside. The lack of sanitation facilities and the spread of diseases are in urgent need of relief. Although there has been significant progress in sanitation facilities recently, the number of medical personnel, according to a survey at the end of May, is only 5,746, with an average of one doctor for every 70,000 people. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, more than 3,000 people have graduated from medical education, and it is quite insufficient to meet the needs, especially in rural areas, which are most affected. Therefore, I hope that the graduating students will serve in the countryside and save this 85% of the population. Then, Mayor Wu gave a speech, briefly stating that graduation is not the completion of learning, but the beginning of a lifelong career. I hope you will uphold correct aspirations and serve society. The construction of a new China requires two kinds of power: one is human power, and the other is material power. People must be educated, and things should be utilized, especially medical personnel, who are the most important, because they can make our nation strong and healthy. I hope you will work hard and dedicate yourselves to society, and continue to study in order to seek further education. Then, after a speech by Jordan, Director of the Health Department of the工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council), Mayor Wu's wife issued certificates to a total of 12 people, and swore to serve society. The student representatives gave a reply, and then went to the open space for photography and refreshments. The meeting ended at about 6:00 p.m., it is said.</p>

<h3>The Selling Trend in the Gold Market Persists, with the Gold Price Dropping Another $6.90; Guangdong Banks' Heavy Short Selling Slightly Covered After the Price Fell to a Low Level, Then Turned Flat; Starting Today, the Afternoon Market Opening Will Temporarily Be Changed to 2:30 PM</h3>
<p>The gold market's trend was still sluggish yesterday, continuing to decline. However, buyers regained some of their previous courage, and were able to push the price slightly higher after it fell to a low level. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw both British and American prices rise. The five metal exchange's forward silver prices were closed. Exchange rates rose slightly. London spot gold remained unchanged. American cotton rose by five pounds, and American wheat bounced back by one-eighth and one-quarter. Although the earlier report that the US Treasury Secretary would continue to buy 130 million ounces of silver still made people nervous, item market prices initially hit $1,000, but due to the extremely abundant supply at the higher prices, the market quickly turned downward, falling step by step. The market only stabilized after falling to $94. Trading outside the exchange opened at $95 or $96, but the trend was weak, with frequent selling. As a result, after opening, even though the banks were healthy, in the end, although they were able to rally, the market was stable at first. When the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's exchange rate was announced, the British rate rose 1.25 and the American rate rose 0.25. Sellers in the exchange fought bravely, but the gold price ended up being sluggish. Afterwards, Chinese merchants continued to sell US dollars, and the banks' appetite was slightly sluggish, causing the internal market to become even harder. The equilibrium was broken again, and most bulls were unable to resist. The $90 threshold was broken. However, because the banks were still willing to pick up bargains, and the Guangdong banks were working hard to buy gold bars, the price was able to rise, rebounding to above $91. At this time, although there were many sellers, some covered their short positions at the lower prices, and the buyers, who had been under pressure for a long time, gradually became active. The Guangdong banks bought aggressively, and the internal market also shifted with the gold price, and the situation stabilized. However, the supply was still abundant at the higher prices, and there were still remnants of the selling trend. The price rose and then fell again. With the support of the Guangdong banks, the market was flat at noon. In the afternoon, the market opened quietly, and the banks were eager to buy forward contracts and sell near contracts. The gold price only fluctuated. In the end, because buyers of forward US dollars were still active, and the Guangdong banks continued to buy gold bars, market confidence was relatively stable, and the market was able to recover. However, because there was a rumor that the price in Mumbai had risen six annas, the price rose and then fell again. Afterwards, the exchange rate market was mediocre, and the gold market's supply and demand were also fairly balanced, resulting in a fluctuating market. The red gold price was calculated at $1,003.60. The Tianjin banks sold over 5,000 taels, adding $11. The following is a record of the day's market conditions:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was $994.60, down $4.20 from last Saturday. Item market opened at $5.50. The exchange rate market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price for British exchange at one shilling and four pence, and US exchange at $33.625. Hongxing and Dingkang sold bars, but because Fuxing, Yongyuanmao, Yongheng, Yu Huixiang, Dafeng, Yongda, Decheng, Yifeng Yong, and others bought, the price rose from $4.50 to $5.90. Huabi bought US dollars for September at 0.875. Hongxing, Yuanmao Yong, Yuqing Yong, Fuxing Yong, Heng Yu, Xie Xing Yong, and others sold, falling $2.50 after learning that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's exchange rate was up 1.25 for British exchange and 0.25 for American exchange. Huabi bought US dollars for October at 0.0625. Shengda, Dafeng Yong, Zhentai, Tongyi, Yuanmao Yong, Zhaofeng Chang, Dingkang, Hengxing, Bingxing, Shunmao Heng, Yu, and others bought together. MacGalli and Mitsui also bought US dollars for October at 0.0625, and the price rose to $5.50. Bingxing, Yuqing Yong, Fuxing Yong took profits at the high price and sold, retreating to $4. MacGalli bought US dollars for October at 0.9375, and Heng Yu continued to buy, and it rose again to $5.30. Market sentiment was still nervous. Under the pressure of the Chinese merchants' selling, Yuqing Yong, Heng Yu, Fuyu, Yufu An, Dingkang, Yi Yu, and others sold one after another, gradually falling to $89. Fuxing Yong, Dafeng Yong, Shunmao Yuanmao Yong, Shengda, and others bought at low prices, rising to $91.80. Heng Yu, Tongyi, Yingfeng, Heng came to sell, retreating to 0.30. Shengda worked hard to buy bars, and Fu'an Yuanheng and Bingxing also bought. Zhengjin bought US dollars for October at 0.0625, and the price rose to above $2. Shengda, Dadecheng, Yuanyi, Heng Yu, and others bought again, and the price rose further to $4. Daxing Yong, Yuqing Yong, Wanxing, Yuanfeng Yong, and Heng Tai sold, the trend was still sluggish, and the price fell to $1.30. With Hui Xiang Shengda's aggressive buying, the price rose again to above $3. However, because sellers were extremely eager, Yuan Sheng Yong, Fuxing Yong, and Yi sold, and the price immediately retreated to $1.80. With Shengda's efforts to maintain the market, the market closed at $992.20 at noon. The item market was bid at $2.30.</p>

Fuxing Yong, Fuyu Hong, Kang Yong sold one after another, and the price retreated to $1.60. However, those who were trying to maintain the price at the low level were courageous. Fuxing Yong, Heng Yu Qing, Yu Daxing Yong, Yuqing Yong Shengda, and others fought to buy, and the price rebounded to above $3. After this, the situation was peaceful, but because Dalian Gang, Yuanyi Fuyu, and Hengxing were still willing to supply, the price retreated to $1.70. The item market was active, fluctuating around $2. The market closed at $991.90, and the item market was bid at $2. The highest price for the day was $995.90, and the lowest price was $989, a difference of $6.60. As a result, the price continued to fall by $6.90 compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The closing price, due to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's exchange rate for US exchange rising by 0.25 to $33, was equivalent to a gold price of $1,048, which was about $56 less than the closing price, about $1 less than last Saturday. July's registered price was $992, and August's was $992. The morning water supplement was $992, and the afternoon was the same. The red gold price was calculated at $1,003.60, about $9 more. In exchange transactions, the Tianjin banks' desire to sell was extremely strong, so the transactions were not deserted, and the market situation was active. Tianjin goods were all calculated at $11, with current goods vendors Yingfeng Heng advancing over 4,000 taels, Dafeng Heng advancing 1,000 taels, Taikang Runna advancing over 300 taels. The Central Bank's current appetite was relatively sluggish. In the previous market, an offer of $988 was made, but no transactions were heard of. The swap was slightly cheaper. During the market opening, Heng Yu Rui Kang were willing to cut prices and sell, and the price fell. Then Yingfeng Heng pasted 140 bars to Yicheng Heng Yu for only 50 cents. Fuxing Yong pasted 70 bars to Heng Yu for 70 cents. In the afternoon, Yuanmao Yong pasted over a hundred bars to Heng Yu, still for 70 cents.

<p>Silk and Tea Road Estate Chunmee Tea Sells Well in Europe. Yesterday, various foreign firms including the British Estate, Jinjiang, Jardine Matheson, Xiehe, and Tongfu showed strong interest in Chunmee green tea from Tunxi, Sui'an, Shexian, Wudong, and other areas in this city. Gaozhuang tea from Wuyuan East Road opened at 114 yuan per lot, and Tunxi tea opened at 1087 yuan per lot, with no change compared to previous prices. Gongse Chunmee tea from Wuyuan North Road also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The green tea market shows a good momentum for development. The sales of black tea are still active, and goods from Qimen, Ningzhou, and Lianghu are also holding steady. However, local estate black tea has contracted to within the 40 yuan range, a drop of four to five yuan from before. Summer silkworm development in Zhejiang is smooth. Early silkworms in Shaoxing are in the great sleep and opening leaves. Due to the small profits and heavy costs of spring cocoons this year, silkworm farmers in the four rural areas of Shaoxing have suffered losses. Many local seed papers remain, so they are supplementing with summer silkworm rearing. The weather is good, hatching is smooth, and development is also good. Early silkworms are in the great sleep and opening leaves, and late silkworms are also sleeping enough leaves. London Chinese Silk Exchange Rate Rises. Japanese silk prices are increasingly weak in the London market. Due to the rise in foreign exchange rates for Chinese silk, market prices have risen. Yesterday morning, Taihe Foreign Firm reported that the price of A-grade Xiulin Feima brand dried silk from Ji'an, London, was 45 shillings and 10 pence, and B-grade Black Lion brand was 5 shillings and 4 and a half pence, each rising one penny per pound. White filature silk also rose by one penny to one and a half pence. Sales of New and Old Filature Silk are Dim. Since the new Japanese silk came onto the market, silk prices in the New York market have plummeted. The price of Shanghai white filature silk has also fallen to 440-450 yuan. Actual sales in Lyon are not rising, and prices are also flat and weak. The Shanghai market is becoming increasingly dim. Foreign firms are unable to sell silk. Yesterday, only Choumeng advanced spot white filature silk. Package prices remain sluggish. The price of tung oil continues to fall. Since foreign firms have reduced their sales of tung oil, the market has gradually declined. Furthermore, there are three to five thousand Xiang tung barrels arriving in the market, and the deteriorating market situation is undeniable. A few days ago, Hankou Foreign Firm still handled dozens of tons at 18 yuan and 6 jiao, but yesterday, Hankou Telegraph reported another drop of 28 yuan. Although the market continues to fall, there are not many transactions, because falling prices do not stimulate buyers' interest. Therefore, we must wait for the situation to turn around, then both parties will rush to handle it. This is the common feeling. The Hankou oil firms' bid prices have also fallen to around 23 yuan for customer regulations. It is reported that more will continue to arrive, so without large foreign sales, it is not easy to become popular again. Zhejiang tung oil is naturally no exception to the impact of Hankou. Recently, Hangzhou firms sent people to Shanghai to sell each zhu at 16 yuan delivered to Shanghai, but there were very few transactions. The local firms believe that this price has not fallen enough, so their willingness to purchase is weak. Yesterday, a telegram from Lanxi, eastern Zhejiang, reported that each zhu was 24 yuan and 6 jiao delivered to the Hangzhou-Jiangshan border. If so, the market has fallen another six or seven jiao. However, domestic sales are about to move, and it is not the right time for families wanting to prepare goods.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Royal Incense Misty Records by Princess Der Ling, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Right behind that cart specifically for the stoves. There was another cart specifically for preparatory work; what is meant by preparatory work is to first do some organizing of the ingredients for the dishes, before they are put into the pot. Because some things need to be peeled, some things need to be cut off, and some things need to be cut into small pieces; almost every raw ingredient needs to undergo some sort of preparation. There were more than twenty people responsible for this task, but they were still very busy. This wasn't because their movements were too slow, but because the peeling, washing, and cutting work was too complicated. For example, bean sprouts, before being put into the pot, must first have the very fine root hairs growing on their stems removed, and this must be done very carefully, making sure that not a single root hair is left behind, and that the stem itself is not accidentally removed, wasting useful material. Considering it this way, even assigning one person to handle just bean sprouts would not leave them very idle. Not to mention that other things need to be generally sorted out! Let's go back and talk about the stoves: there were fifty of them in total, evenly arranged in two rows on the left and right, as if they were a neat and solemn imperial guard. The fuel used in these stoves was coal briquettes; but because coal briquettes are not easy to ignite, waste paper or wood shavings had to be used as kindling each time. But not too much could be used, otherwise the smoke would be unbearable. This part of the fire-starting work was done by miscellaneous servants, who, for the sake of convenience, could be temporarily called Cook C. Because besides them, there were the "upper hands" and "lower hands" who did the real cooking work, who could be called Cook A and Cook B! There were also fifty Cook C's, one for each stove. Cook A, in addition to making two signature main dishes for each meal, didn't take care of anything else; Cook B only needed to stand next to Cook A while they were working, handing them soy sauce, sugar, spices, and the like in order, but because it had to be done "in order," they also had to understand some cooking techniques.

<p>Artillery Platform, Taiwan by Chen Liang</p>
<p>The foreigners' cars are driving towards there one after another. The yellow river water supports the light blue sky. The ochre sails are stretched in the lonely space, moving like snails, moving, moving. At high tide, the reeds at the foot of the high embankment are submerged by the water. A few of the longer ones can still stretch out their heads to breathe in the pure air. The early summer river breeze is hot, and Miss Jin's face is also hot, with a shiny, moist, ruddy glow. I take out a cigarette from my pocket and smoke, leaning against the willow tree, looking at the earth fort covered with weeds. The roof of the black watchtower peeps out from the greenery. A long, unbroken row of barbed wire stretches out on the side, taut without end. The wooden posts are rotten. "Isn't that the relic of the Songhu Battle? Isn't that the original site of the Chinese people's resistance against the Japanese imperial army's invasion?" "Yes! Yes!" Reason answers me. I tug at Jin's sleeve, "Maybe you'll be lying on the bloodstains of the anti-Japanese soldiers, look at the artillery platform over there." "Maybe I'll also be lying on the crude bodies of the enemies." She opens her eyes and looks at the artillery platform, forcefully. The strong sunlight bursts into her pupils, not as tired as before. Brave deeds! Will give people brave feelings. In this world, morality has long been thrown underfoot. This is an era of struggle, and cruel scenes are unfolding one after another. "Jin, aren't we two of the oppressed peoples? Aren't we two who are about to be thrown out by society? Should we fight?" "Of course! This era is not entirely about leisurely enjoyment and lingering over the scenery!" Saying this, she stands up, pulls me along, and, stepping on the early summer sunlight on the river embankment, quietly leaves the artillery platform. Yellow river water, ochre sails: let the foreigners browse as they please.</p>
<p>In the Dining Hall by Xianxian</p>
<p>The first class of the morning is over, and according to school rules, meals are to be served ten minutes later. But in reality, less than two minutes after the class bell rings, nearly twenty tables in the entire dining hall are sparsely occupied by energetic young people. The dining hall, which was as silent as an ancient temple, is instantly filled with life. There are six or seven minutes left before mealtime, but the sound of chopsticks hitting the tables and the sound of soy sauce dishes colliding with the table surface echo each other, scaring the dining hall attendant so much that he repeatedly urges the kitchen to serve the food. Plates of dishes are sent from the kitchen to the dining hall and poured into the stomachs of the young people. Like a whirlwind sweeping away the clouds, they are eaten beyond recognition in less than three minutes. At this time, eleven or twelve people who are punctual for meals walk in through the dining hall door. The dishes on each table have already been eaten, so what's the use of saying anything? The kitchen has to start over and add two more tables. One wave is barely calmed when another rises. On a certain table in the corner of the hall, a cockroach is found in a dish. This is detrimental to hygiene and must be negotiated with the cook. The cook puts on a sad face and apologizes, but with a bang, a bowl is smashed to pieces by a student as a demonstration. The cook gives in and agrees to the old practice of serving a plate of stir-fried shredded pork to each table. Struggle is the mother of success, and the students have won the final victory, so joyful sounds fill the dining hall. On the way out, some hum "The Peach Blossom River is a Beauty's Nest," some hum "I am Like a Bird in a Cage," or hum other tunes. But the cook just hides at the kitchen door, rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>Stolidly Unmoving by Shiying</p>
<p>"Cholera" by Chengshi</p>
<p>"Talking about tigers turns faces pale." This phrase is used now not to refer to fierce tigers in the deep mountains, but to the infectious tiger epidemic. Although fierce tigers in the deep mountains can harm people, there are very few of them, and they can be seen with the naked eye; the germs of the tiger epidemic are tiny and difficult to detect with the naked eye. They take the opportunity to invade the human body and immediately multiply and breed, numbering in the millions! They can cause the death of one person, one family, or one village in a short period of time. "Cholera," Western name Cholera, old Chinese name "Huo Luan," is itself a spiral or coccoid bacterium that is scattered in dirty air and unclean food. If people are unfortunately infected with it, they will experience very severe vomiting and diarrhea, eventually leading to death! "Cholera" kills tens of millions of people every year and can be said to be a major enemy of mankind. We know that ditches, corners, garbage dumps, toilets, etc., are the main bases for the accumulation of "cholera" bacteria. Our only way to prevent it is to use the domestic product "Yalin Disinfectant Odor Water" (produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy) and pour it into their main bases to kill the germs of the tiger epidemic. This method of eradicating the roots can allow people to safely pass through the dangerous summer.</p>
<p>Northeast Fourth Company Commander by Zhang Henshui, Chapter Thirty-one</p>
<p>Three Battles with White Coats Charging into the Snow Formation,</p>
<p>The Entire Battalion Sacrifices Themselves, Red Eyes Piercing the Gun Forest</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang is a person whose will is somewhat weak but whose emotions are extremely rich. Today, seeing Yin Deren fighting so desperately, he became much more excited. He stood alone on the castle, looking out at the city. He was lost in thought when someone behind him called out, "Old Zhao." When he turned around, it was Tian Qing. This child was also covered in black earth today. He had a rifle slung across his shoulder outside his bulky cotton coat. The front of his coat had two torn holes. Although he was still walking with big strides, he was walking with a step and a pause, fully showing his fatigue. He smiled and said, "What's wrong? Little Tian, are you tired?" Tian Qing smiled, "We're both the same." Zhao Ziqiang said, "You little devils are really fierce. They almost charged up here last night. I had to come up here in the second half of the night. These kids are sure to come today. We don't have a radio, so it's really not easy to ask for reinforcements." Tian Qing said, "Don't even mention the radio. We asked for two flat-trajectory guns a month ago. They promised us half a month ago, but they still haven't arrived." Zhao Ziqiang laughed, "Let's accept it and just do it this way. If the little devils are as energetic as they were last night, we won't have much trouble dealing with them." Tian Qing smiled, "We'll deal with them if we can, and we'll deal with them even if we can't. I haven't lived in vain as a Northeasterner to this day. The brothers are still at the East Gate, and I have things to do. Goodbye, Old Zhao." Ziqiang didn't have time to say anything to him, and they separated. Originally, no one had time to chat at this time. So if you want to chat, you should change it to calm down. Ziqiang stood on the castle for a while and suddenly realized, "What am I daydreaming about? Things are still busy." He slowly walked down the castle step by step. He saw Battalion Commander Bao Fang leading a dozen brothers hurrying up the city. When he saw Ziqiang, he said, "It's good that Company Commander Zhao is here. I was just looking for you." Naturally, Ziqiang followed behind him after hearing these words. Bao Fang walked to the crenel and pointed forward for Ziqiang to see and said, "Look, this is the road due north. It's also our communication line with the pass. If the enemy wants to besiege us, they must charge out of here." (418)</p>
<p>Record of Rain by Renzai</p>
<p>Mid-June 1933, the plum rains were continuous, and disasters had formed in various places. The Yangtze River was rising, and forty-eight embankments in Qichun collapsed.</p>
<p>June 12, 1897, there was a frog rain near Barmica Wood City in England.</p>
<p>June 21, 1901, a small fish rain fell in the state of Carolina, USA. On July 16 of the same year, an ant rain fell in Belgium. On January 13, 1917, a grain rain fell in Ishinomaki Town, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan.</p>
<p>"Sky weeping" refers to rain falling when it is clear with no wind and no clouds. Scientific explanations: (1) The effect of wind. (2) Formed by thin clouds.</p>
<p>There is a lot of rain in South China. In Fuzhou, on average, there are only two clear days a week in spring. There is little rain in North China. It does not rain for several months in Beiping, and when it does, it is only for a few hours.</p>

<p>New Record for Childbirth in the East Forest</p>
<p>A woman named Marie Heilmann in Vienna, Austria, has become very famous for having her twenty-ninth child after being married for thirty years. She is forty-five years old this year, and her husband is forty-nine years old. Since giving birth to her eldest son in 1907, she has successively given birth to twenty-two boys and six girls. Among them, there was a pair of twins, and she had two instances of giving birth twice in one year. She is the fourteenth daughter of her parents, so we can know that this is probably due to the lineage of fertility!</p>
<p>Automatic Hotel</p>
<p>The city of Bruges in Belgium has recently established a so-called "automatic hotel." Anyone who wants to stay in the hotel only needs to insert twenty-five francs into the automatic machine in front of the hotel door, and a room key will roll out of the machine. These twenty-five francs are the lodging fee. All rooms are the same price, so you can open whichever room you like. This is really very convenient.</p>
<p>Multinational Flag Police</p>
<p>Recently, police officers with foreign flags rolled up on their sleeves have appeared on the streets of Paris. These police officers are said to be graduates of the foreign language school of the Paris Public Security Bureau. For example, a police officer with the Italian flag rolled up on his sleeve is a police officer who speaks Italian. His job is to take care of all matters for Italian tourists.</p>
<p>Police Wolf</p>
<p>Among the police dogs belonging to the Vienna Public Security Bureau in Austria, a six-year-old wolf has recently been added. Originally, this wolf was captured from the mountains by hunters and later sent to someone related to the Vienna Public Security Bureau. The people who conducted the experiment trained it together with dogs. Because its brain and nose are naturally sharper than dogs, it soon became a very capable police wolf. It has also established meritorious achievements several times. According to experts, the police wolf is number one in Europe.</p>
<p>Man Who Eats by Spider Silk</p>
<p>In the York area of England, there is a man named John Scott who specializes in eating by spider silk. He often goes to the countryside to collect many spiders. First, he puts the spider on top of a stick, and then gently shakes the stick. The spider will be frightened, prepare to escape, and spit out spider silk. Then he rolls the spider silk onto another stick until the spider's abdomen is empty. This kind of spider silk is an indispensable thing for making theodolites and other scientific instruments, so it can be sold at a very high price.</p>
<p>Poor Student's Bitter Strategy</p>
<p>A poor student named George Peck in Wisconsin, USA, was hired by farmers who were troubled by frost damage in potato fields in order to earn his tuition. From midnight to five in the morning, he flew a kite one hundred feet above the ground, agitating the air to prevent frost. He succeeded in doing this and received 400 gold dollars, which he used as tuition to return to school.</p>

<p>Free Talk: Mandarin and "Mass Language" by Wei Mengke</p>
<p>The so-called "revival of classical Chinese" is actually just a "last glimmer" of a dying lamp. It is not worth making a fuss about, let alone worrying about. If we are planning for the future of young people and prevent them from being needlessly fooled, and then attack it as a group, although the effort spent is too wasteful, it is still meaningful at present. The issue of "mass literature" was raised as a serious issue several years ago, but what was gained at that time was only an empty slogan, and theoretical struggles were almost completely absent. It was not until the creation of the Literature Monthly in 1932 that Mr. Song Yang raised this issue again. This time, not only was there a development in theoretical struggles, but it also involved the very language of "what language to write in," which is a prerequisite problem that mass literature urgently needs to solve. However, after he battled with Mr. Zhi Jing for a round, it was unfortunately delayed due to the suspension of publication of the magazine. Now, we are raising the issue of the construction of "mass language" again for development and discussion. If this can become a new movement as a result, the significance will naturally be even greater. Looking at the current discussions, it is already agreed that language and writing cannot be separated. But "what language to write in," whether the masses have a universal language, and whether we can adopt a language as a "mass language," these questions seem to have few concrete opinions. But Mr. Song Yang has proposed it before: he believed that only "modern Chinese Mandarin" is the "mass language," the universal language among the masses. However, the Mandarin he referred to mainly refers to the kind of language that is popular in "modernized factories." Therefore, according to Mr. Zhi Jing's investigation, it is known that it is still based on the local gentry, and it is still not a language that can be understood by the general public. In fact, "modern Chinese Mandarin" is universal. It is mainly popular in ships, trains, docks, stations, inns, restaurants, amusement parks, etc. Factories are only affected. This is brought in by migrant workers, but because their lives are not mobile, they will eventually assimilate with the local language. The so-called Mandarin is produced because of the development of transportation, the increasing close contact between people from various places, and the demand for convenience in communication. Therefore, its purpose is only to be understood. It does not accommodate various dialects. It tries its best to avoid various dialects. It is trying to be able to say and write every word, and to find meaning for every word. It is more concise than Beijing dialect, with fewer "er" and "la" sentence-ending particles. Naturally, "modern Chinese Mandarin" has not yet reached perfection, and sometimes it is mixed with some so-called "southern accent and northern tone" (fragmentary dialects), but it will inevitably develop with the development of transportation and change with the transformation of social consciousness. China is under the current world frenzy, and the unification of language is certainly not a distant matter. At that time, the unified language will be transformed from "modern Chinese Mandarin," and it will probably not be wrong. Therefore, I think it is possible to adopt the universal "modern Chinese Mandarin" as the base for constructing "mass language" literature. Writers trying to adopt Mandarin in their works may not be the initial step for literature to approach the masses. Writing articles entirely in Mandarin may become the clearest and most concise article in the future. I am very skeptical about the proposal to use dialects. Dialects are primitive languages ​​with no progressiveness. Dialects can only be read out loud, but no meaning can be found (a "dialect" that is both sound and meaning is one that everyone can understand and everyone can speak, and it is not a dialect. For example, the word "捣蛋" (dǎodàn, make trouble) is often said by people other than Shandong people.) Take Mr. Zhang Tianyi's novels as an example. The most used curse word is: "奶奶雄" (nǎinai xióng, maternal grandfather). What do we know this "奶奶雄" refers to? Also, words like "啊啦" (ā la), "顶括括" (dǐng kuòkuò), "乖乖噲" (guāiguāi kuài) and other words, unless you are a local, you cannot understand their meaning from the words. If an article uses many incomprehensible dialects, even if annotations are added, what is the difference between that and using idioms and allusions! The construction of "mass language" literature is a difficult task and requires more research and debate. When it comes to the adoption of dialects, I hope you will not ignore the effect it currently has on literary works.</p>
<p>It's the Right Time by Zhang Chenglu</p>
<p>"The pheasant on the mountain ridge, it's the right time! It's the right time!" Things have their own time. The Bible and Buddhist scriptures have been ridiculed by some people for more than ten years. "Realizing that today is right and yesterday was wrong," now is the time for revival. Guan Yu and Yue Fei were deities repeatedly conferred titles by the Qing Dynasty, but they were neglected by the Republican Revolution. They were remembered again in Yuan Shikai's later years, but they were buried with Yuan Shikai. The second time they are remembered again is now. At this time, of course, we must emphasize classical Chinese, flaunt our literary knowledge, show elegance, and read ancient books. If you are from a humble family, then even if there are big storms outside, you must still move forward and struggle desperately, because you have no stable nest to return to, so you have to keep moving forward. Although after you have established a career and a family, you may repair your family tree and build an ancestral hall, pretending to be from an old family, but this is still a story for later. If you are from an old family, you may still go out for the sake of showing off, satisfying your curiosity, following the trend, and eating, but even a little success or a little setback can make you retreat immediately. This retreat is not small. You simply retreat home. What's worse is that your home is an old and dilapidated mansion. In this mansion, there are old goods in the warehouse and dust in the corners, which cannot be moved away all at once. If you have the leisure to sit and eat, you can still look around, repair broken books, wipe ancient bottles, read family trees, and cherish ancestral virtues to pass your years. If you are extremely bored, you will need to repair broken books, wipe ancient bottles, read family trees, and cherish ancestral virtues even more. You will even turn over dirty walls and open empty drawers, wanting to discover treasures that even you yourself cannot understand to save this hopeless poverty. These two types of people, those who are well-off and those who are poor, are different. Those who are leisurely and those who are urgent are different. Therefore, the speed of the ending is also different, but at this time, they are both making a living from antiques, so their views and behaviors are the same, and the momentum seems to be huge. As a result, some young people are also influenced, thinking that they can really find their savior in antiques. They see that those who are well-off are so leisurely, and that those who are urgent are so focused, so there must be some truth to it. It is natural for people to imitate. However, time never shows mercy. They will eventually get an empty void. Those who are urgent are fantasizing, and those who are well-off are joking. If the proponents have no special skills and no sharp insights, saying that antiques should be placed on the incense altar or thrown in the latrine is actually just fulfilling the task of deceiving oneself and others for a while. To find precedents is everywhere.</p>

<p>The moon lengthens the shadow of the house, like a black boulder. Lying under the oak tree, the dog will not swallow it. XXX The summer wind sweeps across the small river, and a dark shadow descends on the house. The dark shadow moves and rests on another's shoulder.</p>
<p>Child by Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Coming over, almost becoming a habit, as long as I hear a child crying, I can't help but go over and pick him up, walking back and forth in the room. The child's temper is really strange. When others hold him, he always cries non-stop. As long as he is in my hands, and I walk him around the room two or three times, he will stop crying. First he yawns with his eyes open, then his eyelids droop, and at the same time his breathing becomes light. This often causes great surprise to my wife, who is exhausted from being pestered by the child. Every time she sees the child sleeping soundly in my hands, she always says to me with a smile: "I didn't expect you to have such ability, you're quite the experienced baby-holder!" Hearing my wife's words, and then looking at the child's sleeping posture in my hands, I unconsciously smile with relief. Thus, the task of holding the child has become one of my daily routines. This is how I feel: sacrificing some of oneself to benefit others is something that everyone in this era should do, especially since the one sleeping in my hands is my own child. However, this matter has gradually given me great trouble. The child's temper is so strange, perhaps he has become accustomed to sleeping comfortably in my hands. Except for the usual sound sleep at night, at other times, he always refuses to touch the pillow or mat, and it's no use even pushing him in the stroller. He just cries, and only stops when I go over and pick him up. I have always been a person who values ​​time, and once I have to take out part of my time every day to put on the matter of holding the child, it goes without saying that I will feel impatient. Especially when I am writing an article, the child suddenly cries, interrupting my train of thought. Although I reluctantly put down my pen and go over to pick him up, my heart is still hanging on that article. This makes me want to think of a workaround: wait until he falls asleep in my hands, then transfer him to his mother's hands. However, right during this transfer, he wakes up again and cries again instinctively, making it impossible for me to let him go. Several times, when I was extremely annoyed, I couldn't help but want to steel my heart and throw him on the bed, letting him cry, but I couldn't bear to do it. I had no choice but to say to my wife: "Let's hire a nanny to take care of him!" My wife shook her head. She often holds an opposing attitude towards my proposal. The reasons for opposing are very sufficient. The first is of course that she has a lot of milk and doesn't need to spend eight or nine yuan a month to hire another nanny. The second is that Shanghai customs are superficial, and most nannies are unreliable. She is not at ease leaving the child in their care. In order to confirm her words, she further cited the example of a nanny in a certain family not long ago who fed a child a steel needle because of being dismissed, saying that hiring a nanny to take care of the child would only increase the child's danger. With these reasons, I had no choice but to be patient and set aside time every day to hold the child. Generally speaking, no matter what the matter is, once it becomes a habit, it will develop a kind of interest. At first, I regarded holding the child as an annoying thing, but as the days went by, I felt as if I had lost something if I didn't hold the child for a moment. Looking at the child sleeping in my hands, his little eyes tightly closed, his head tilted slightly upwards, his mouth open in a half-moon shape, and his sweet breath coming out of his little nostrils, I always feel a kind of nameless joy. Thinking that his future achievements may be far better than my incompetent father, I can't help but smile sincerely. This smile often startles the child awake. It's strange that my temperament and mood have changed recently. I don't know where my usual impetuous habits have gone. Now I can handle every matter very patiently. This secretly makes me wonder, could it be that holding the child has such a big influence on me? I also talked about this strangeness with a friend, and the answer surprised me unexpectedly. "This is nothing, everyone who transitions from youth to middle age is like this." That's right, my mood has indeed been somewhat close to middle age recently. I am very attached to the present, and although I still have many extravagant hopes for the future, they are not as strong as they were a few years ago. Who knew that my youth had slipped away silently without my knowing it! What a great loss this disappearance of youth is in my life! When the child fell asleep in my hands again, I couldn't help but feel a little lost.</p>
<p>Impression of Zibo by Luo Wang</p>
<p>(1) For the sake of touring lectures, our itinerant acting troupe had been to Zichuan and Boshan counties, the coal-producing areas of Shandong. The organization we were attached to was the itinerant lecturing group of the Public Education Center. In the places we went, we showed open-air movies at night and what the common people called "new plays" during the day. We ourselves called them "costumed lectures." Every time we arrived at a place, the City God Temple and the Guan Yu Temple were often where we lodged; the stage in the temple was our excellent workplace. We hung up a gray soft screen and used the costumes we had prepared. At least five acts of plays in an afternoon, plus speeches explaining the plot and purpose of the play during the closing time. The three- to four-hour plays were watched by three to five thousand (?) people crowded together, and we saw from their laughter and tears that our plays were understood by them. These audiences were often hardworking farmers, and the gentry class was at most only five or six percent, so most of them were in short clothes, cloth jackets, bare ankles, carrying oil baskets, and carrying sacks. The facts proved that spoken drama can be enjoyed by the masses, and we often competed with the "Xi Guan" and "Nan Guan" "itinerant troupes" or "five-person troupes," pulling them so that no one went to see their plays when they struck the gong. We always formed a temporary market wherever we went, just like a temple fair. Thinking of Mr. Xiong Foxi and Chen Zhice's experiment with farmers' drama in Dingxian, and our itinerant acting in various counties, towns, and wheat fields, it proved that spoken drama is not a "foreign trick," but something that the masses are willing to accept. Therefore, we also walked around, increasing a lot of knowledge and experience. Being able to perform dramas suitable for the lives of the masses to the masses, and being able to be understood by the masses, this can be called a kind of mass drama. As for acting in the circle of middle-class intellectuals in a corner of the city, although the theory is so advanced, in reality it still cannot reach the masses in short clothes, and even the plays performed cannot be accepted by the masses. I think it is better for us to look for problems from practical work and bury our heads more and argue less than to shout in vain like that. Speaking of which, this is also the reason why we have been implementing itinerant acting for three or four years and are unwilling to show off in front of others. In order to explain "why" I had a trip to Zibo, I will first write this short introduction.</p>

<h3>Settling Accounts and Handling Funds During the Mid-Year Season</h3>
<p>! Foreign Exchange Rates Remain Unchanged for Days!</p>
<p>Yesterday, being the beginning of the week, the silver and money business was inherently busier. Coupled with the approaching end of the month and the mid-year closing season, the previously sluggish financial market showed slight improvement. However, the foreign exchange market price remained at six percent in the morning and afternoon, unchanged for several days. Adding water to the drawing resulted in a blank drawing, indicating the ongoing inadequacy of funds. The transaction volume of exchange bills reached over 4.6 million in the morning session, including transfers and new transactions. The afternoon session saw over 200,000 in transactions, over 500,000 in small consolidated transactions, and over 900,000 in redemption of foreign pawn loans, with over 1.4 million in new loans. Bank receipts and disbursements increased compared to the past, especially settlement receipts and disbursements, which saw a particular increase due to the closing season. Foreign banks' receipts of bill payments totaled over 3.5 million, settlement receipts over 3.2 million, telegraphic transfers over 1.2 million, and receipts for various goods, foreign exchange, pawn collateral, and miscellaneous items totaled over 6.2 million, with 600,000 entering warehouses. Chinese banks' receipts of bill payments totaled over 4.1 million, settlement receipts over 3.7 million, telegraphic transfers over 800,000, customs duties over 800,000, and receipts for various goods, foreign exchange, pawn collateral, and miscellaneous items totaled over 4.7 million, with 800,000 leaving warehouses. Japanese banks' receipts of bill payments totaled over 2.9 million, settlement receipts over 2.5 million, and receipts for various goods, foreign exchange, pawn collateral, and miscellaneous items totaled over 4.7 million, with 500,000 leaving warehouses. Money shops' receipts for foreign public bonds totaled over 48.8 million, receipts for foreign drawings totaled over 7.5 million, receipts for various remittances totaled over 700,000, banknote withdrawals totaled over 600,000, issuances totaled over 1.7 million, cash receipts totaled over 600,000, customer sources totaled 300,000, and disbursements totaled 500,000. Furthermore, the total exchange volume at the clearing house on the 25th was 9,598,981.52 silver dollars, including 4,298,091.83 silver dollars and 5,300,889.69 silver dollars in remittances.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Small Coins Rise by $9.50</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for subsidiary currency saw a complete rise across the board, with Jiangnan small coins experiencing a particularly sharp increase. The opening price in the morning was $820, a rise of $1.50 compared to the previous session. In the afternoon session, buyers were unwilling to sell, leading to a sudden increase of $8, bringing the price to $828. As a result, the price rose by $9.50 compared to the previous day, with 3,500 coins traded in the morning session and 5,000 coins in the afternoon session. Guangdong small coins traded at $732 in the morning session, a slight increase of $1.50 compared to the previous session. The afternoon session saw a decline of $1 to $731, resulting in an overall increase of only $0.50 compared to the previous session, with 75,000 coins traded in the morning session and 40,000 coins in the afternoon session. Copper coins also increased by 1,000 cash compared to the previous day, trading at 330,000 cash, with a transaction volume of 36,300 strings of cash, equivalent to $11,000.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Continues to Rise Before Securities Settlement; Only July Issue Traded Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, only one day remained for trading of this month's futures contracts. Although there was no fierce surge in the market, prices continued to rise. While squeezing was not severe, the short sellers ultimately felt disadvantaged. Because only a few contracts remained for settlement or rollover, fluctuations were relatively stable. Today, only the July issue was traded; trading in June futures has ceased, with settlement scheduled for the 18th. Trading in August futures will not begin until the 29th. There is no indication of a downward correction in the future trend, and the market may stabilize for a day or two. While prices have indeed reached a peak, this should not be considered in isolation from the environment and sentiment. Without changes in the political situation, even if there is some fluctuation in the future, it will not easily cause a sudden drop. Yesterday, in the morning session, numbers 26 and 38 were sold off quite a bit, but sporadic buying led to scattered yet surging momentum, and short-term gold also surged by as much as 8.5 cents. The remaining bonds also rose uniformly by 2-3 to 5-6 cents. In the second session, there was only a slight decrease of 1-2 cents in the "Bianyiyi" bonds, while all other bonds continued to rise. Retail investors were extremely busy covering shorts and rolling over positions, and prices rose again by 3-5 cents. The bond market suddenly saw new highs. The continued rise to such high prices indicates the strength of major players' buying power. In the afternoon session, the market was relatively stable, with most bonds slightly better by about 1 cent. However, numbers 4 and 69 were sold off heavily, causing "Zhenglu" to buck the upward trend of short-term gold and instead decline. However, this was due to rollover activity, an occasional phenomenon. The market became slightly weak at the close, and "Zhenglu" continued to decline by a small amount of 4 cents. This was also a reaction to the fact that most of the "Zhenglu" bonds were held by too many long positions. The final result was a price increase of about 2-3 cents to $1. The total transaction volume was estimated at over 20 million. The price fluctuations are listed below (unit: dollar):</p>

<h3>Three Grades of Yarn Fall by Eight Dollars; Long Positions in Out-of-Specification Yarn Slightly Liquidated</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains firm because the sales of spot yarn picked up again in the afternoon, maintaining investor confidence. In addition, the long positions are quite strong, holding tight and not releasing their positions. However, apart from the eighteen-dollar decline in three grades of yarn this month, some scattered long positions have been slightly liquidated, so the market loosened by 6-8 cents. The future situation will still depend on actual demand.</p>
<h3>Distant Month "Golden Rooster" More Stable</h3>
<p>The opening of the futures market was quite strong due to short covering by retail investors, but as trading reached the second and third sessions, the cotton market declined, and three grades of yarn also fell by another eight dollars this month. The closing was flat, and as a result, the prices of all months declined by one cent. It is said that three grades of yarn remain weak after the New Year. Long positions in the market are being liquidated, and the second and third sessions saw declines. The closing prices for nearby months remain weak, while distant months are slightly higher. As a result, prices for all months fell by 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 cents. Total transactions for the day were 48,250 bales. Da Feng sold 3,050 bales, Shen Ji 2,400 bales, Xin Chang 800 bales, Hui Kang 1,050 bales, Sen Kang 1,600 bales, Yuan Feng 2,100 bales, Xie Sheng 1,200 bales, and Rui Da 1,450 bales. Xin Cheng bought 1,600 bales, Da Chang 1,700 bales, Heng Chang 3,550 bales, Yi Chang 1,500 bales, Tai Chang 1,150 bales, Yuan Yi 2,550 bales, Chun Ji 1,000 bales, Sui Long 1,050 bales, Yuan Da 900 bales, and Ming De 800 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Futures Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Open Interest</p>
<p>June 183.3 182.7 182.7 Down 0.60 14,000</p>

<p>Total 315,200</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn Sales Not Weak</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. Total purchases by various groups for the day are estimated at 1,550 bales. The market situation is similar to the previous day. The purchase volume of each group is as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin 25 Guangdong 380, Inland 690 Wuhu 5 Jiangxi 15 Sichuan 300 Luzhou 25 Anqing 10 Colleagues 100</p>
<h3>Ample Delivery of Cotton This Month</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly flat, because the ample supply of delivery contracts for this month is putting pressure on the market. However, new cotton for distant months is more expensive. First, the weather is too dry, which is damaging the crop. Second, there are reports of flooding in India. Therefore, buyers are focusing on new cotton, which is tightening the market.</p>
<h3>Buyers Focus on New Cotton</h3>
<p>The opening of the futures market was lively, as deliveries for this month are active, and distant months have also softened, resulting in a decline of 2-3 cents in all months. In the afternoon, the market for nearby months remained weak, falling by 1 cent to 5 cents. New cotton for distant months rose again by 1 cent due to reports of good Indian cotton news. Total transactions for the day were 70,000 dan. Heng Yi sold 1,000 dan, Hui Kang 5,500 dan, Shen Chang 3,000 dan, Tong Xing 2,200 dan, Chong An 1,000 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 2,200 dan, Da Chang 400 dan, and De Ji 1,000 dan. Sui Long bought 3,100 dan, Chang Yu 1,100 dan, Yi Chang 2,400 dan, Chun Ji 3,100 dan, Jun Chang 1,300 dan, Chang Feng 600 dan, Tai Xing 1,100 dan, and Heng Chang 1,500 dan.

<p>Total 777,800</p>
<p>(Cotton Mill Demand Only So-So)</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are average. The source is estimated at 570 bales of "Tong" cotton and 80 bales of "Yao" cotton. Spot cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Shaanxi cotton $45.25 Yufeng Factory purchased 200 pieces of spot goods for delivery to the factory.</p>
<p>Shaanxi cotton $45.50 Baoxing Factory purchased 100 pieces.</p>

<h3>Weekly Report on Bombay Cotton Industry</h3>
<p>The market situation at the beginning of the week was completely dominated by the liquidation of long positions. Regarding the "Lan Duo" long positions, they preferred to take profits first and were unwilling to hold onto the July/August positions. Japanese inquiries have stopped due to rising prices, but may revive if prices fall slightly. China is more active, while Europe is quiet. The monsoon rains are favorable, and both "Aumu La" and "Bailuo Xi" have received widespread rainfall. The statistics for the past week are attached below (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<h3>Grain and Flour Futures Prices Rise Unabated</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months showed a rising trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago, rose by one dollar, and Canada rose by about 20-30 cents. In addition, the weather is very dry, and the heat has also soared. Jiangnan and other places have entered a period of panic, so after the opening price, investor sentiment was extremely excited. The money industry and manufacturers' related long positions deliberately raised the prices wildly, causing the prices for all months in each session to resemble turbulent waves, reaching an extreme level. The transaction volume in the first half of the day reached 800,000 to 900,000 bales, showing how lively the market was. When the market opened in the afternoon, the opening price for the current month immediately rose wildly, and the short sellers in the industry covered their positions regardless of price, causing distant months to also rise sharply. However, in the middle of the day, some profit-taking long positions took advantage of the high prices to liquidate their positions, resulting in a slight decline. Later, the money industry resumed its vigorous buying, so the market returned to a high level. Overall, the difference in prices for the day was more than one cent for the near months and 7-8 cents for the distant months. The total transaction volume for the day reached a huge 1.7 to 1.8 million bales, the first such record since the fall in flour prices. This shows that the potential strength of long positions outside the industry should not be underestimated. As a result, the current month surged by 1 cent and 7.5 li, July rose by 9.25 li, August rose by 8.75 li, September/October rose by 8 li, and October rose by 7.5 li.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, prices for all months showed a rising trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago, rose by one dollar, and Canada rose by 20-30 cents. In addition, the weather is too dry, and all places are suffering from drought, and the asking price of spot wheat in Wuxi has reportedly risen by 20-30 cents. Therefore, after the opening price, the prices for all months immediately rose by 3-5 cents. The liveliness of the exchange was rarely seen in recent times. When the market opened in the afternoon, the surge in flour futures further stimulated investor sentiment, especially in the current month, which was due for delivery and had a large short squeeze, reaching a high of 58 cents, a huge increase of 17 cents. The remaining months also rose sharply, but the distant months were relatively flat. Looking at the subsequent steps, there may still be a lateral jump. As a result, June rose by 17 cents, July rose by 13 cents, August rose by 11 cents, September rose by 9 cents, October rose by 8 cents, and November rose by 11 cents. The spot wheat market also rose by 5-10 cents due to flour and wheat futures. Wheat from Suqian, Bengbu, Mingguang, and Linhuai Guan was quoted at $3.05. Wheat from Liuhe, Gaoyou, Jiangyan, Xinfeng, Yangzhou, and Anqing was $2.95. Wheat from Hefei was $2.94. Wheat from Nanjing was $2.85, with a secondary grade at $2.75. Wheat from Bianjiang was $2.85, with a secondary grade at $2.80. Wheat from Hushu was $3.12, with a secondary grade at $2.80. Wheat from Daqiao was $3.00, with a secondary grade at $2.97. Wheat from Wuxi was $3.00. Fuxin took 15,000 bags, Fufeng took 5,000 bags, and Xinda and Huafeng each took 2,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Downriver Rice Prices Rise by 30-40 Cents</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various groups were slightly scarce compared to the past, with 14-15 late rice, thick japonica, and various colors of 15-16 rice arriving (a total of 4,500-6,000 shih). The late rice market had vitality yesterday, and today the sentiment is upward and the situation is very active. Both wholesale and retail sales are strong. It is said that the supply of rough rice in the inland is gradually depleting, and the prices are rising daily, so the sentiment is firm and stable, and the selling price has suddenly increased by 35 cents. The thick japonica shops are also strong, and with the help of package sales, the market feels particularly tight, with prices rising by 30-40 cents. A total of 2,400-2,500 bags of late rice and 600-700 bags of thick japonica were sold. The price of "Du Yang Jian" also increased by about 10 cents. "Yin Yuan" has been in short supply for a long time, so it is in high demand, and the price is also rising by more than 10 cents. "Bian Yuan" has no gains or losses.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the downriver sources were only 7-8, and the market sales were active due to the long-lasting sunny weather and the upward sentiment. "Bai Geng" sales were active, "Zao Bo Dao" sales were acceptable, and "Bai Yuan" and various fragrant rices were traded normally. The market price of "Bai Geng" increased by 10-20 cents, and the price of "Zao Bo Dao" and "Du Jian" increased by about 10 cents. The price of "Bai Yuan Yangbu Ke Jian" increased by a few cents.</p>
<h3>Prolonged Drought Spurs Rise in Foreign Upland Rice; Over 10,000 Bags Traded Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the upland rice market suddenly became active. The long-dormant trade in foreign rice "small twists" saw 2,000 bags change hands. Sentiment was upward, and market prices surged. As the days passed with no rain, the farmland could not be transplanted, and both the inland production areas and the foreign groups were optimistic. Yesterday, the "Beiyang" group suddenly arrived in the market to actively trade, sentiment was upward, the price of high-quality rice immediately rose by 20 cents, and the price of medium-quality rice rose by about 10 cents. As the recent arrival of rice has decreased and the production areas have reported rising prices, the market atmosphere is particularly intense. Yesterday, approximately 11,000 bags of rice were sold. The "Beiyang" group purchased 2,500-2,600 bags of upland rice, and jointly purchased 2,000 bags of "small twists" with this street. The "Fuzhou" group purchased 1,000 bags of upland rice, and the rest was purchased by this street. It is said that the price of "small twists" has now opened at $7.55 after falling a few days ago.</p>
<h3>New Rapeseed Continues to Fall by 10 Cash</h3>
<p>Yesterday, new rapeseed prices depreciated and were sold off as a result of weak sales, abundant harvests, and merchants seeking to liquidate their stocks. A transaction of 100 tons of Pinghu goods took place at a price of 2 liang 7 qian 2 fen according to foreign exchange rules, falling by 10 cash compared to last week. According to industry insiders, it will be difficult to stabilize the price. There were no changes in the new broad bean market. The supply of soybeans exceeded demand, and the price continued to fall by 3 fen. A transaction of "Feihe" beans took place at a price of $1.64. Factories on this street purchased 6 carloads of Xuzhou beans at a price of $2.54 to $2.525.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Weak with No Transactions in Raw Sugar or White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, with the continuous decline in customs gold and the increase in Dutch exchange rates, and at a time of uncertain sentiment, the Public Association's pricing board still showed a dull picture. The outgoing price of No. 24 raw sugar and white sugar was $20.02, while the incoming price was only $20, so there were no transactions. A few dozen bags of Taikoo Sugar's B mark were priced at $20.05, a decrease of 1-2 cents compared to before. The asking price for No. 1 domestic white sugar was $19, but no transactions took place. The supply of Hainan red sugar is endless. It is recently heard that the merchants are willing to sell at $12.80, but buyers are instead taking a wait-and-see attitude. The situation is relaxed. It is said that the domestic "Chao Qing" price plummeted in production areas, but it was a false rumor, so the pricing board tightened. Yesterday, only 500+ bags were sold by industry colleagues. The price of "Ti Zhuang Qing" was $13.1, and the price of "Huang Gang Qing" was $12.8. Prices ranged from $11.9 to $10.85 and $10.8 to $11.75.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Zhangzhou Lychee Assured; Zhangpu Sees a Bumper Crop</h3>
<p>The cold weather at the beginning of spring in Zhangzhou froze the flower seedlings, and there was also little rain during development, so it is said that the result is only 20-30% of the harvest. However, the "Wu Ye" lychee in Zhangpu will have 80-90% of the normal harvest. According to recent correspondence from the production areas, new dried lychees such as "Wu Ye Zao Hong" may be available in mid-July, while "Lan Zhu" will have to wait until the end of the month.</p>
