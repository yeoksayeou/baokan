<h3 id="c30">薩爾問題之前途 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>據二日柏林電訊德政府對於薩爾人民。巳發出通告命其依照凡爾賽和約之規定。凖備參加明年度之「全民投票」。藉以决定此一區域之歸屬問題。吾人苟不健忘。當憶希脫拉曾向法國直接交涉要求立卽交還薩爾且聲言法國果肯准如所請。則德國更無他求云云。希脫拉素以恢復失地自矢乃其對法之土地要求。竟若是其微小。殊出世人意料之外然而希氏之要求仍爲法人所拒絕。今就希氏之通告觀之蓋巳放棄其原有之主張而屈就凡爾賽和約之規定矣。國社黨態度之馴善。至於此極不獨有乖其平日之言論且較之其他政黨。亦大不如。蓋其他政黨之對外立塲雖不甚强硬然尙能達到削减賠欵之目的。而使凡爾賽和約有相當的修正希脫拉自登臺後喑噁叱咜。目空一世。以爲辦理外交。亦可危言恫嚇。一如奪取内政者然結果遂致失歡各國。孤立無助。今其態度。雖巳逐漸沈默軟化然其不能得人之信任與同情。則依若也。今後薩爾區域之能否歸還於德實與希氏政策大有關係姑</p>
<p>就吾人管見所及。一申論之。</p>
<p>按照凡爾賽和約之規定。薩爾區域。於國際聯盟所組織之統治委員統治十五年後。當地人民。卽可舉行投票決定三個問題（一）維持現狀卽仍由國聯統治。（二）爲與法合併。（三）爲歸還德國。此三問題至明年舉行投票時自當水落石出獲得最後解决。唯就現有之種種事態而觀此一區域之能否歸德實大有問題。設德國至今而無希脫拉其人。吾人敢預測明年薩爾之歸德無甚問題。唯在希脫拉獨裁之今日則殊　逆料也。其困難之可得而言者第一爲法國之態度自希黨在薩爾區域大肆活動之後。法國卽利用其在薩爾統治委員會中之勢力。積極取締。同時主張防止希黨操縱明年薩爾居民之投票運動。據本月二日日内瓦電。此一問題巳列入在本月中旬開幕之國聯行政院會議議事日程中。可見法人對於薩爾明年度之投票運事前巳有操縱之凖備。此爲薩爾歸德之難關一也。</p>
<p>第二薩居民八十萬。雖皆爲日耳曼人。然大部又爲天主敎徒德國中央黨之勢力。居全體人民之半數。可謂薩爾區域中之唯一大黨然此一政黨卽代表天主敎徒之政黨。其性質與奥國道爾夫斯所領導之基督社會黨（今巳與奥之内衛團合併。成爲法西斯性之政黨。）性質相同在奥反對希脫拉之德奥合併運動者。卽此代表天主敎徒之基督敎社會黨而天主敎徒之所以排斥希黨者不欲受希黨之統制耳。蓋希黨而得勢則不獨其他政黨皆無存在餘地。卽天主敎亦將受其所統制。此一事實旣巳表演於德國難保不波及於其他德人之區域。奥之日耳曼人。心知其然故寗願與拉丁系之意大利合作。而不願與同文同種之德意志合併。今以奥之前例推測薩爾雖不中當亦不遠。蓋一則德之天主敎徒。與希黨至今猶有糾紛二則代表德國天主敎徒之中央　。自希氏登臺後。巳爲希黨所消滅。轉不如國聯統治下之薩爾中央黨。反能自由活動。由此而論。薩爾之天主敎徒與中央黨鑒於前車之覆轍自必懐有戒心。不欲薩之歸德。此其難關二也</p>
<p>第三薩爾礦區之工人。多受社會民主黨與共產黨所指導此等政黨在德皆爲希黨所撲滅。其銜恨希黨之切。自必遠過於希氏未登臺之前近聞法人巳設法優容此等政黨。令其黨報加緊反對薩爾歸德之宣傳運動此爲薩爾歸德問題之難關三也。且自希脫拉登臺之後。凡不容於德之人民多聚居於薩爾。此輩亡命之徒。自必反對希氏之成功。可斷言也。</p>
<p>就此數點觀察。薩爾區域。卽使於明年舉行投票亦恐難以歸還德國其結果或將維持現狀。仍受國聯之統治。如是則德之外交又將遭一度之失敗矣</p>

<h3 id="c86">日本新的外交策略（日本通信）　有吉首先回國　廣田聲明用意 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>廣田外長所謂的道義外交、一新外交陣容、實際運用上、算是對美外交、巳得到了相當的功績、現在要次第召集駐在外國的大公使、回日本商酌新對策了、而者先應召回國的、就是駐華公使有吉明、從他歸國的步驟、以及歸國的時期、就可以窺知有吉氏歸國的重要性、日本對華外交、照廣由的意思、是打算乘這時候、轉變其以前的兇相、而爲比較的緩和外交、　　企圖經濟聯盟</p>
<p>注重應付蘇聯</p>
<p>然軍部方面、仍力主强硬、以爲至少日本要在中國取得所謂特殊地位、並且這種特殊地位、須爲世界各國所公認、祇少須得英美的諒解、所以外務部情報處長天羽英二、將廣田外長的說話、作成一篇非正式的談話、當作一種宣傳資料、向世界宣傳、旣申明了日本的立塲、又求得了軍部的諒解、不意竟因此惹起世界輿論的反應、又促起了英美兩國的嚴重注意、於是廣田氏又命駐外大公使到處解釋、特别是對英美要更詳細的解說、說明日本並未打算鎖閉東門戶、卽滿洲門戶、也可以開放的意思、來作一種策略、</p>
<p>有吉氏歸國的重要事件、報告中國的實情、　然是一個、其中尤其重要的、是進行其所謂中日經濟聯盟、因爲這件事、在中國一般經濟界、當然是贊成的少、反對的多、很不容易得到適當各意的效果、在國際方面、又都要取得優惠的利益、不肯讓日本獨占、尤其是在太平洋方面、關係重大、日本須細心應付、有吉氏歸國的任務、就是商量這一類的對策、看要運用怎樣的手腕、纔可以不致挑動列强的反感、纔可以使美國英國都取旁觀的態度、同時又是怎樣纔可以制著中國不聲不響聽她擺布、其内容－詳細的辦法、還不甚明瞭、大體上的原則是巳决定了、</p>
<p>日本凖備對蘇戰爭、差不多成了公開的秘密、不過這一戰爭、要什麽時候發動要以什麽方式發動、現在還不可知罷了、目前或最近的將來、日本還没有攻撃蘇聯的决心、最大的原因、是國際關係不曾弄好、在東北的各種工事、剛纔着手、而日本自身的軍事整備、還没有完成、特别是航空隊與坦克車隊的擴充、還不曾齊備、他自巳國内的經濟狀况、除了軍需工業之外、還是在不景氣之中掙扎、所以他不肯立卽挑戰、所以他第一是完成其所謂的「日滿經濟聯盟、」這不消說是要將東北四省的經濟實權、都歸收日本之手、并且是由軍部一手管理、卽三井三菱財閥、也須聽軍部的指揮、照軍部的說法、所謂、日滿經濟聯盟、」是以國防爲主、這個國防、不待言是指大興安嶺一帶的工事、以</p>
<p>及穆陵一帶的軍事設備、和東北四省境</p>
<p>内新計劃的七大鐵道綫、與鋼鐵工業氮氣工業·等等、大興安嶺的軍事建築、巳經次第實施、最遲明年夏季以前要完成、幾條重要的鐵道、特别是熱河的鐵道、今年就會完工、</p>
<p>現在没有把握的、在日本軍閥看、還是國際外交關係、對中國他還是有戒備之心、想要早一點有種確實可靠的辦法、對英美更是焦慮不安、假使日蘇發生嚴重問題、英美兩國、如果持嚴正中立態度、不給日本以物資的援助、他的他的鋼鐵原料和石油等重要資源、就會没有來源、結果卽不免於陷入悲境、所以廣田外交、一面要與英美求諒解、找出調和的因素、一面要獨占遠東市塲而不顯痕跡、這就是要與有吉商量將如何玩這一套的把戲、（四月三十日於東京）</p>

<p>相傳包頭在淸代、一片沙漢、人稀少、集五家或十家爲一村、居民多爲蒙人、純以游牧爲生活、間有貿易者、鳳毛麟角、均以腦包爲商塲、蒙漢通商、造端於斯、當時有大靑山中鹿、時來「轉龍藏」飲泉水、蒙人玩賞、觸景生情、漸呼東郊一帶爲「包骨圖」、包骨圖者、卽包頭命名之根源也、時有西藏大喇嘛來包、掛鍚轉龍藏、醫卜問世、名噪一時、會康熙征噶爾丹、返經腦包、備致欽仰、爲建五當山廣覺寺以居之、同時居民飲水思源、復爲喇嘛建廣德寺於轉藏、商賈日多、逐漸進化、始闢包頭、</p>

<p>喇嘛原係佛敎之一種、唐貞觀時、佛敎輸入西藏、爲神鬼邪說所　雜、故廟内塑像多神怪、且爲適應環境、身爲喇嘛、所食、牛羊肉仍如故、此亦與釋敎迴然不同、蒙人迷信喇嘛敎、爲喇嘛者、其榮殆如淸時之科舉、生子至少必有一人爲喇嘛、否則活佛將降病殃、故生殖率日低、子爲喇嘛、如進學校、有時且賴家人、供給費用、彼成千成萬之喇嘛、皆不事生產、而以化緣爲生、尙以政敎之手腕、取得人民之供養、美人安得利斯謂、「蒙古民族之滅亡、全由於喇嘛敎、倘能廢除喇嘛敎、再受政府相當敎化、蒙古尙有希望」、此言頗含至理、綏人有倡蒙地普及敎育、以代喇嘛敎之議、蒙人如「土默特總管公署、總管滿泰」、「蒙邊司令部秘書長榮祥」、等、聞皆學養俱深之士、與其他曾受學校敎育之蒙古靑年、曷不努力爲之、</p>

<p>長春通訊、日人在我東北計劃中之五路、在九一八事變以前、卽屢向東北當局要求修築、終因人民反對未果、今旣佔踞我東北、當可爲所欲爲、故去年度巳將其他四路築成、未成者僅長大一路、但本年三月中旬、又動工興築、全路計長約合八百餘華里、因沿綫旣無山險、又無河流、以是進行頗迅速、現巳將路基鋪好、預計在九月間卽可通車、至日人積極修築該路之用意及經過地點、亦極可注意也、</p>
<p>日軍雖佔我東北、而蘇聯方面、因有中東路之護符、在在予日方以不便、日人雖設法亟欲收買、俄方則虚與委蛇、不肯輕輕放棄、日人有鑒及此、故對該路之破壞　不遺餘力、而大賚又爲北滿重鎭、位居遼寧·吉林·黑龍江·三省交界、設長大路築成、　一旦日俄戰起、日方卽可由大連直趨北滿、遮斷俄人之歸路、使俄方决大敢輕出國境、長驅哈爾濱、則中東路之價値、完全掉、此可見長大路之重要也、</p>
<p>東北大豆出產之豐富、名聞於世、尤以北滿爲最、出口方面、完全仰賴中東路之運輸、因之該路收入數目、實足驚人、日方决不情願大宗利權爲蘇聯取得、故决心建築長大路、將來該路完成後、中東路不但失掉其軍事上之價値、卽貨運方面、恐亦無人問津、彼時俄方雖欲不賣、亦不可得矣、</p>
<p>大賚位於松花江流域、氣候適宜、各種農作物出產豐富、因水路運輸、亦很便利、以是商業十分發達、又該處產魚尤多、價造廉時、竟有每斤售洋一分者、故日本一般工業家集資籌設大規模製魚罐頭公司、現巳着手籌備、在五月間、卽可開始製力、而月亮泡所產之魚、佔全數十分之七、現該泡巳由日人賤價收買、同時該泡據滿鐵會社測量結果、謂能發八十萬匹馬最之水電、現正在集資設立水電廠、日方經營所以如此積極者、實欲將該地造成爲北滿之重鎭、以及工業中心區、</p>
<p>該路由吉林之長春縣起、中經農安·扶餘·二縣到黑龍江之大資縣止、再北銜接洮昻路之白城子站、（今巳改爲洮安縣）此路完成後、日本在東北之鐵路綱計劃、亦完全實現矣、</p>

<p>— 章淵若</p>
<p>考列國憲政發展之過程、其憲法之頒布、亦類都因時而制宜、英國最初頒布之大憲章、僅爲對於國皇課稅權之限制、厥後於一六七九年、一六八八年、一九一一年、一九一八年、一九二八年始陸續加以補充、法國最初頒布者僅爲參議院與政權組織法、亦屬殘缺不全、自是厥後、歷年加以增訂、他如芬蘭憲法之施行、另以法律定之（芬憲九十五條）、普魯士憲法之公布、僅卅一－四三曁八六諸條、發生效力、其餘諸條則於州議會按七十四條所規之新選舉後施行之、（普憲八十八條）波蘭憲法自公布日施行、其中條欵、有須另以法律規定施行者、則自各該法律施行之日起發生效力（波憲一二六條）立陶宛憲法、自公布日施行、但最遲應於十年内經國民公决核准之、（立陶宛憲一○七條）暹羅憲法自公布之日施行、惟仍須受暫行條文之限制、（暹維憲法第七章第六四－六五條）觀此、則憲法之頒布施行、固須視其民族的特殊城要與環境、而有斟酌變通之必要也、</p>
<p>中國憲政問題之困難、非在善良法制之創立、而在法治主義之推行、法治之精神、非僅止於白紙黑字之法典、而尤貴乎法律之實施、法律之擁護、法律之遵守、律之普及、法律之編訂其事易、其時暫、而法律之實施、擁護、遵守與普及、則有待乎法治精神之發揚、有待乎民衆習尙之造成、其事艱、其時長、而其效尤難著、中國民衆、素乏法治之精神、故維新變法之結果、新法律與舊習慣、初未發在任何關係、任何影響、新其所新法所法、而民衆仍舊其所舊、習其所習、改元以後國人仍急於求功、不圖其本、所制之憲、仍與民衆之習慣、未能一貫故吾人今日如欲求憲政之成功、自當於千鈞一髮、成敗所繋之訓政時期、努力培養治精神、鞏固法治基礎、務使將來之大法、與衆能打成一片、與民衆之精神習慣、能互相一致、不再離民衆而背馳、此項訓政工作之成敗、實爲吾國社會治亂、憲政成敗之總關鍵、（見拙著政與法治二十年三·二·中央日報）故當前歲起草約法之時、愚卽爲文、說明約法之之主要目的、一爲完成革命主義、二爲促進民權發展、三爲建設地方自治、四爲培養法治精神（詳見拙著約法眞詮二十年五月七日大公報）現在訓政尙未完、自治毫無成績、則此時憲法、論其精神、自仍當不出此四目的、論其實用當僅限於「試行五權之治、」（建國大綱十九條規定如此、）在憲法未頒布前、「各院長皆歸總統任免而督率之」（大綱第二十一條（憲法草案、當本於建國大綱、及訓政憲政兩時其之成績、由立法院議訂隨時宣傳於民衆、（大綱二十二條、）而不得亟亟以兩月爲公開評論時期、至於公布施行、則尤應照建國大綱第二十三條之規定、俟全國有過半數省分達至憲政開始時期、卽全省之地方自治完全成立時期開國民大會决定公布之、</p>
<p>戴季陶氏致立法院長孫哲生氏書中有言曰、「吾黨同志、若無爲國家百年大計而立法爲國家人民之福利而行法洽之决、或隨意利法、或立而不行、皆非所以完成國民之道、故兩年以來諄諄以實行約法爲言耳、今茲召集國民大會制憲、其意義之重且大、自然十百倍於約法、但若依然國人之態度、猶是對於約法之態度、則其憲絕之止於政務停滯、天下之大亂國家之危亡、或且因之而起、蓋國民今日、尙有一線之希望在將來、以爲國民大會尙未開、而憲法尙未製定也憲法發布後、中國國民黨於革命建國之任務、巳達最後階段、若其不能行、或行而有重大之缺陷、則國民之希望旣窮、而意外之變化莫　矣、」語重绅深、實獲吾心、</p>
<p>總之、制憲大業、永垂久遠、國家治亂、唯此是繋、非可隨意着筆、草率從事、　區愚見、自審精諴、老成謀國之士、幸深察之、（完）</p>

<p>首由主席童行白報告、略謂、今　　天是革命政府成立第十三週年　　紀念日、我們爲什麽要紀念十　　三年前的革命政府成立紀念呢、因爲這一次是總理就任非常大總統的日子、對於我民族國家的前途、有重大的關係、我們在此紀念期中、回想民元迄民十、這十年的歷史中、政治上發生不少困難、政治組織及形態、都有異常的變動、政府常被野心家操縱、所以總理爲促成革命計、非把萎靡不振的局面、改變一下不可、在當時一班人等見解、以爲民國成立、滿淸推翻了、就算是革命成功、在總理看起來、就不然、他覺得非將三民主義實現、非將全國的意志統一、革命實未成功、所以他寗可辭臨時大總統的職務、而在廣州組織革命政府要用黨的力量、摧毁封建餘　如稱帝的袁世凱·復辟的張勛·等實行叛逆的勾當、使中國政治的綱紀爲之蕩然、總理用全力與之奮鬭、故終有廣州革命政府成立、這是從國内說的　至於國外的帝國主義、又勾結一班政客軍閥、實行幸割中國、因之不平等條维、大半在那時簽定、實在是很可痛心的爲要完成救國救民的志願起見、總理竭力促成廣州的非常國會、和革命政府所以民國十年的革命政府、在民國歷史上、是有極大的關鍵、這是第一點、第二、革命政府成立後、總理絕不肯利用粤邊勢力、以攘權利、要以廣州爲根據地、進而統一全國的、所以於革命政府成立後、第一件事、就是北伐、等到旣打下湖南江西一部份的地方以後、陳炯明在廣州實行叛逆、乃回師蕩滅之、旣滅陳逆、又有第二次北伐、爲本黨奠定了很穩固的基礎、民十五年、蔣總司令的第三次北伐、實遵行總理遺志、到十七年國内便大部份統一了、我們推原其始、實以民十的革命政府成立爲根據的、今後我們後死的同志、必繼續總理遺志、擁護我們現在的領袖、以完成統一局面、如有叛逆、要起來擾亂中國統一者、必全體起而攻撃之、第三總理在生前抱不屈不撓之精神、與列强奮鬭、絕不肯把中國一尺一寸的土地送給外人、在粤爲了關稅問題、與外人奮鬭、無論帝國主義者如何以勢力來迫脅、總理是不肯喪失國家一點利權的、所以革命政府之成立、實亦爲對付帝國主義的、時至今日、東三省雖被暴日以武力奪去、但在法律上、我們始終未簽定始終未予以承認、日本以通車通郵等問題來誘引、政府至今並不受誘、日本最近之聲明、說日人在中國特殊地位、西方國家不能來干涉、我政府巳予以嚴厲駁斥、外間不諒、有所懐疑、不知政府策略、實始終未改、不過、因爲目前力量、尙嫌不够、將來國内實力充裕了、自有收復失地的希望、這是要看我們的努力如何了、</p>

<p>次吳市長代表陳克成致詞云、　　今天是五五革命政府紀念、也　　就是總理就任非常大總統的紀　　念日、吳市長是本會主席團之　　一、本定凖時來出席的、但因同時本市還有工人運動大會、和市府也開紀念會、爲時間衝突、來不及到此、所以特派兄弟代表參加、今天的紀念、在這内憂外患、相交煎迫的今天、我們回想當年總理在艱難困苦中、領導本黨與惡勢力决鬥的偉大精神、使我們起了無限的敬仰與感慨、在總理逝世一直到現在的十年當中、本黨誓師北伐、以至於全國統一、革命初步的事業、將告完成、而接踵而起的、却是外患的侵凌、和赤匪騒擾、外患的横襲、是要截斷我們革命的前路、赤匪的剼擾、以又破　了我們建設的進展、同時在外來的侵襲、和内在的不安中間、更給若干的野心家利用機會、希圖危害黨國、過去的閩變、便是一例、縱然費去了鉅額的代價、把閩變削平、可是整個的國家民族的元氣、又是經了一度的　斵喪、内未安而欲攘外、言攘外而别有會心、這便是中國現在一般普遍的現象、於是安内者不能放乎做去、而外患却更加不斷的壓迫、這種形勢、一天不轉變、中國便一天不可救藥、正如一個人的思想不正而要强制其行動不入於岐途、正是何從說起、我巳經說過外患的横襲、是要截斷革命前路、那末我們國家民族的出路、是否因此而便被截斷了呢、這裏我們便有個極大的前提、便是我們要用什麽方式來避免被截斷、同樣</p>
<p>我們用什麽方式來自强、這種理智的自强論、在國難發生以來、便少有人汪意過、敵人飛林大砲决不是我們的紙上談兵所可抵禦的、那末、我們唯一的凖備、便是要怎樣來跟着人家去製造飛機大砲、要製造飛機大砲、便非把整個國家的力量來努力不可、同樣、要齊集整個國家的力量、那便非統一國家不爲功、要統一便要安内、這結論便是先安内而再攘外、尤其是要安内、便得削平變亂、剿滅赤匪、在這個結論下、我們再檢閱過去兩年中民衆一般意識的揭示、我們却又不能不失望、可是我們再檢閱過去兩年中本黨的工作、又怎樣呢、我們縱不能自滿、却又不能不使我們興起叛逆的削平、赤匪的剿除、在蔣委員長領導下、顯著的成績、國人共知、毌庸多說、而各種建設事業的進展、便是英美的與論也多表示着驚駭的贊服、從這裏、我們可知證實惟本黨能救國、亦惟本黨才能在外内夾攻中奮鬥、才能復興中國、同樣、安内攘外的程序的不容顚倒、便從鐵一樣的事實中堅定了他的立脚點、說到這裏、我們要更進一層來看、一般的國民意識、又爲什麽要這樣的消沉呢、有人說、這頽廢消沉、是新舊過渡時代所必經的階段、那末、中國維新三十年、爲什麽新階段又老是没有進步呢、我們的回答、是國民思想的不統一、而尤很少正確的言論來引導、於是所表現於事實的、便有這國難以來兩年來的證明、今後本黨的工作、除一方面、於實地的安内和建設以外、尤要在國民一般思想的糾正、要糾正這頽廢消沉的思想、而使實行到現實的日常生活上、我們便更得努、</p>
<p>力於提倡和實行新生活運動、從小我的新生活運動中、來培養我們大我的偉大精神、來担當就國家民族非常時期的重任、這便是我們今天紀念總理的意義、我們今天的口號、是紀念總理要肅淸反動份子、實行新生活運動、努力建設、誓　國恥、</p>

<p>申報年鑑，本爲紀念申報六十週年而創刋。自二十一年七月着手進行，至翌年四月編成。出版以後，頗承各方獎許，殊非同人意料所及。惟在中國，以統計之不易蒐集，材料之難求凖備，於數月之短期間内，完此巨帙，墨誤　漏，自知不免。同人於第一次編輯工作告竣後，重加檢視，殊深慚恧。旣承熱心愛護者君賜批評指正，乃使同人得更明瞭欠缺所在，與夫改進之鵠的。而申報總經理史量才總主筆張藴和兩先生，亦以第一次年鑑風行全國，以後非於内容更求精審，無以副海内讀者之望；因此乃有澈底改編之舉。改編經過之足述者：　　一爲各專家及各界之合作申報年鑑，屬於普通性質，所涉範圍頗廣，欲於各門類盡得　　之材料，斷非羣常之徵求蒐　所能濟　·此次改編之初，特　求國内各專家各專門人員及機關團體，予以切實之合作，俾克完成一規模較備之普通年鑑。幸承各界不吝金玉，或慨任專篇之編撰，或指示改進之要點，或賜以不易獲得之材料，觀另列之「特約編輯人」一材料供給人」兩表，可知此二百萬字之藴　，實爲全國學者專家羣策羣力之所致，而非同人等所敢自居其功也。</p>
<p>一爲通訊調查之試行　依編輯年鑑成規，以徵求蒐集各種巳發表之統計爲原則；惟一種</p>
<p>綜括的統計之完成，所需時日頗久，及其發表，在未明編製統計實况者，巳嫌其　舊。當第一次編輯時，對於徵求蒐集，巳盡相當之力，乃尙有以材料過嫌陳舊見責者。此次改編，因就「人口」「農林」「合作」諸，試行進一步之通訊調查。其結果：人口編得十餘省民政廳及各市政府迅速寄與資料，俾得參照各刋物中之人口表，以成一「試編全國戶口數表」，其總人口四萬七千三百五十三萬七千三百三十五，與社</p>
<p>會調查所王士達先生調查結果相近，似尙未完全失敗；農林調查，得各專家以巳成重要統計見寄，多爲以前徵求所未得；合作由合作學社代發通告調查，材料巳較上次爲可信。此次通訊調查之試行，所獲雖仍未多，不可謂無些微之進步，故以後仍擬繼續辦理，以求完善，倘蒙各機關團體予以積極之援助，俾得逐漸更新，則受賜者，因不僅同人巳也。</p>
<p>申報年鑑經此次澈底改編後，可視爲業巳確立　礎者究有若干部份，同人現尙未敢斷言。惟因此一度改編之經騐，愈覺其事之非易。在改編時期，爲力求精確起見，特約撰稿諸君及社内同人，屢將巳發之稿，抽回修改，以是稿幅較預定者增多，出版亦因而延期。較閱旣竣，自覺仍多未能愜意之處。至關於舊列門類之變動，用意在於廢除不關重要之獨立篇目，合併於性質相類之各篇内，以免重複而便檢查，惟如此是否可稱愜當，於檢閱時是否便利，則仍望大雅之指示也。</p>

<h3 id="c192">讀書問答　「中國新文學運動史　資料」讀後的疑問（二續）　－答王仁堪君－ <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>一種新文學的成長，是有賴於雙富的階級生活的内容的。我們看那些徘徊於「藝術之宮」的中立份子，是怎樣在他們淺薄的，軟性的生活基礎上，來支持他們文學的門面！他們不是完全歐化，以資本主義没　期的享樂，做他們文學作品的内容，便是陷入於玄想。在這裏，我們可以舉出幾本作品來作例。冰心的繁星寄小讀者，是當時傳誦一時的作品，但我們進一步考察一下，這些東西所表現的，除了所謂淺薄的個人主義的愛，還有别的什麽。劉大白的舊夢郵𠰯，可以說是毛詩的變體，在内容上充滿了玄想的色調。其它，汪靜之的蕙的風，兪平伯的冬夜，莫不是停在這樣一個小天地内兜圈子，至徐志摩，不過「集其大成」而巳。照一般文學發展的歷史過程看，一種新文學的產生，其初期，應該是進攻的，有革命性的；應該是内容勝於形式的。然而，中國的新興資產階級的文學，却完全取了相反的形態。這表明�</p>
<p>了什麽呢？這表明了民族資產階級一抬頭便走上崩潰的途徑，失却了鬥爭的力量不能豐富；本階級生活的内容。所以在文學上，一般上　的智識份子，只拾取没落期的歐美資產階級生活的渣　。只能取巧形式去粉飾自身的淺薄。卽在文字的使用上，他們所成就的，除了歐化句子，便是新式古文，因爲一種語言文字運動之完成，也同樣是要受社會條件極大限制的啊。</p>
<p>說到這裏，我們應該特别提醒　者的，是在我們新文學運動的過程上，對於民族資產階級上層知識份子完全絕望的時候，當我們考察「五四運動」雖然開展了新文學運動，却並没有完成文學運動上的任何課題的時候，我們是不是就認爲新文學運動停止了它的運行呢？不是的，我們要注意一件事！「五四運動」旣使新文學運動深入了小資產階級的學生及小市民層，那末，必然的這較廣大的一羣便要起來要求他們自巳的文學。他們在某一時期是較上層資產階級的知識份子更積極的，他們雖然最易動搖，但他們是站在從資產階級到大衆的中間，他們容易看出資產階級的無力，同時也易發現下層羣衆之在蠢蠢欲動。於是當資產階級知識份子在文學運動上巳經喪失了他們的力量，而下層君衆還没有達負起這份責任的成熟期的時候，小資產階級恰恰地便當了這一過渡時代的橋梁。我們在否認資產階級智識份子在新文學運　上的成就，同時，我們還應該承認「五四」後支持這一運動的代表小資產階級的各羣。接着�</p>
<p>，我們便不能不落到周氏兄弟，創造社和文學研究會上去了。</p>
<p>就大體上看，他們－－這些前進的小資產階級的代表，是付與了這新文學運動以特定的内容的。他們提出「爲人生而藝衛」這口號，在目前看來，固毫不希罕，但在當時，對於那些爲「功名」爲「趣味」而藝術的封建文學者們，對於那些爲藝術而藝術的開小差的資產階級的文學者們，却不能忽視他的實踐的戰鬥意味。在創作上，也同樣產生了一些進步的東西。首先我們應該提出的是那使人不能忘記的魯迅，他的作品，從狂人日記以至阿○正傳都充滿了反封建的積極意義。其次郭沫若的詩和他的三個叛逆的女性，無論在内容和形式上，也是全新的作品，是有新生命的作品。如果我們要提出接受文學遺產的問題，只有這點點遺產是値得我們接受的啊。</p>
<p>那末，在這統一的單綫上，爲什麽會形成許多不同的壁壘呢？文學研究會和創造社爲什麽會在這時對立起來呢？顯明的這是因社會發展的不平衡，和他們階級本身的缺陷，而反映到文學上，於是使在　州經過了長時期的發展的各個階段的文學思潮，在中國便龐雜地同時出現。當我們認識這問題的時候，我們决不要以爲這是一個不好的現象。我們不要懼怕鬥爭，他們的鬥爭，巳不和白話文論戰一樣僅僅是形式問題，而是更切實的内容的問題。諴然，文學研究會是保守的，是趨向於自然主義的，創造社是進取的。是趨向於浪漫主義的。但我們的認識，只應該限於這一點，我們不要進一步來爲誰辯護。他們的鬥爭，是有促成另一階段的新文學運動長成的相當作用；同時，他們均受着本身階段的限制，却誰也没有勇氣走進那另一新的階段去。等到社會迅的進展，經過了「二八」「五卅」以至一九二五－－二七年的大革命的浪潮，下層羣衆起來要求他自巳的文藝，意識地負起這新文學運動的任務時，雖最早提出「革命文學」的呼聲的創造社，巳經和以前的創造社換了另一面目了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c218">學習和行爲的改變 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 氷如</p>
<p>小朋友：「你們在學校裏學習各門學科，你們的目的是在認識幾個字和讀畢幾册書，就算滿足了麽？」</p>
<p>没有一個小月友敢回答一聲「是的」吧？</p>
<p>那麽你們爲什麽要進學校來學習各門學科呢？我就很快的告訴你們道：「你們學習著，要改變你們的行爲。」</p>
<p>學習一項事物，便是學得一種新的行爲方法；學得這新的行爲方法以後，就該在事實上表現出來，從前所没有的行爲，現在有了，從前不好的行爲，現在變得好了。比方說，上過衛生科，此後就不喫水果攤前蒼蠅爬過的西瓜，聽敎師講過合作，就在學生自治會中服從大衆的意見，這纔是眞正的學習。這樣的學生能夠把衛生和合作的道理來改變他們的行爲，他們是好學生，他們不枉學各門學科。</p>
<p>僅僅讀書多少頁，多少課，或多少册，没有把多少頁多少課或多少册中的東西在行爲上表現出來，這個學生是不懂學習的道理的。</p>
<h3 id="c219">勤學 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 序東</p>
<p>小朋友，你們可知道美國開國時候的一位大科學家和大政治家－－富蘭克林嗎？他在小時何嘗有錢去買書，又何嘗有充分的時問去讀書！但是他不怕窮苦，仍舊很勤奮地讀書，終於成爲婦孺皆知的大人物！他是窮苦人家的孩子，十十多歲還没有上學。他父親是製蠟燭知肥皂的工人。他有時在家裏幇助父親剪燭心；有時背了肥皂到街上呌賣。他每把父親給他的零用錢買書看。看過了，再變買新書。如此的過了多年，他巳看過了很多的書。</p>
<p>後來，他的哥哥：開了一所印書館，他便在館裏做學徒。他每天除工作和讀書以外，簡直不做别的事情。肚子餓了，史吃些蘿葡乾，把飲食省下來的錢，去買書。看完了，便又到書館裏去變賣。</p>
<p>小朋友，看了上面的故事。你們以爲如何？你們的父親，送你們到學校去，爲的是讀書：你們的師長，終日勤懇地敎導你們，都希望你們讀了書，得到豐富的有價値的知識。將來爲社會謀幸福······。</p>
<h3 id="c220">畫眉烏和喜鵲 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 式燕</p>
<p>一個金銅的烏籠裏，裝着一隻畫眉，明亮的陽光照在籠欄上，發出耀眼色彩，彷彿國王的宮殿，盛水的盂是碧玉做的，淸到極點的水也映得綠了，盛粟子的盂是瑪瑙做的，正好盛同樣顏色的粟子·還有擱在中間的三根横欄，預備畫眉停歇的，是象牙做的·披在籠外的籠衣，預備晚上蒙下的，是最細的絲織成的綢做的·</p>
<p>一天，他的老友喜鵲飛到他的籠子所掛的枝頭，立着休息·畫眉撲着翅膀，飛舞着對喜鵲道：「看！言之成理樣的房屋，這樣的布；置，有誰能比得上尼！」喜鵲不慌不忙的答他道：「這樣的好房屋和布置，我可没有享受過，但是，那深藍的天空，浮着小白帆似的雲，葱綠的柳梢，微笑的紅杏，我是常玩到的；有時我高興起來，便張翅而飛，開始作長途的空中旅行，飛過了綠的平原，壯闊的長江，鋪着黃砂的大野，濁流滾滾的黃河，才想要休息，收　翅膀停下來，歇在一個大都會的城樓上·下望街市，一切情形都十分淸楚，假使餓了，就隨便找些野草果實吃；也隨便在溪水裏洗浴，白天還是活動跳舞，不過不像你有金銅的籠欄圍住罷了，」畫眉聽了，不由得把頭低着，一聲不響的默念·</p>
<p>小朋友·照你看來，究竟畫眉快樂呢？還是喜鵲快樂呢？</p>
<h3 id="c221">蜜蜂和蝴蠂 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 周玲</p>
<p>春天巳經來了，大地上的一切，都是美麗而可愛，紅紅的桃花，和其他的花都從它們的花苞中漸漸地開出花來。鮮艷的顏色，和綠如翡翠的垂柳相襯着。多麽美啊！</p>
<p>三三兩兩的蜜蜂都成羣結隊的在花心中採蜜，採了多量的甜蜜，藏在它們的家中。等到春天夏天去了，找不到食物時，就在家中吃他們當時用勞力換得的蜜。</p>
<p>許多蝴蝶，換了美麗的衣服，也在花心中採蜜，採得了蜜，便一齊吃掉，吃飽了後，便驕傲地在花中跳着輕快的舞它們終日祇是吃着舞着，一些也不想到春天夏天去後的生活怎樣，只知道譏笑别的蟲類，在這麽好的春天還要忙忙碌碌的工作，是多麽乏味啊！</p>
<p>但它不知道它的困苦就在眼前了！美麗的春天夏天回去後，那驕傲的蝴蝶，只好俄死在污泥之上。勤愼勞苦的蜜蜂，却在家中和子女們很快活的過着安樂的日子。</p>

<p>國恥日，是五三，蔡公時殉難在濟南。　　割鼻剜目眞慘酷，此讐不報没心肝！國恥日，是五九，廿一條件怎接受！　八十三日袁皇帝，萬人吐駡眞遺臭。國恥日，是五卅，顧正紅無辜遭慘殺；　學生游行與演講，南京路鮮血染泥沙。國恥日，六，二三，沙基慘案眞悲慘。　只爲援助五卅案，無數同胞中槍彈。國恥日，九，一八，瀋陽城一夜大屠殺。　遼吉黑熱全失去，靑天白日旗不得掛。國恥日，一，二八，上海閘北忽被炸。　健兒血戰不怕死，吳淞口死守砲開花。重國恥唱從頭，大家聽了别發愁，但願齊心同奮鬭，雪盡國恥方罷休。</p>

<p>小朋友們！你們覺得做日記感到痛苦嗎？我現在給你們幾條規則，想你們也是喜歡的吧：</p>
<p>（一）日記須記明日·曜·晴·雨·陰。</p>
<p>（二）日記須記實事。</p>
<p>（三）每日例行的事情，如起身·刷牙·漱口·吃早飯等，不必多記。</p>
<p>（四）日記的範圍很廣，如筆記心得，評論時事，摘記日常所見所聞，以及隨時隨地發生的感想等，皆可記載。（五）日記資料須擇較有價値的。</p>
<p>（六）日記切忌抄襲舊文。</p>

<h3 id="c224">寫字方法的進步 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>人類能够寫字，是人類最大的一椿幸福。因爲能寫字，就有記載，有了記載，古代的許多知識，才會流傳到代，給後代的人利用。如果不會寫字，那末許多重要的事情，只重靠日語流傳下來，（　如現在許多民間故事，都是幾百年來由口頭傳下來的。）但是口語是容易誤傳，更容易失傳的，如果單靠口語，我們老祖宗創造出來的許多文學上和科學上的珍貴產，一定會遺失，那不是我們人類的大損失麽？右圖是說明從石器時代以來寫字方法的進步情形。</p>
<p>（一）石器時代的人類，將發生的事情畫在洞穴的石壁上獸骨上。（二）（三）埃及人把象形文字鑿在牆上和陶器的碎片上，後來又寫在紙草紙上，紙草是尼羅河岸的一種植物（四）巴此侖人和亞述人把楔形文字寫在泥板上。（五）羅馬人和希臘人亦寫字在紙草紙上，有時候寫在羊皮紙上。（六）羅馬人又用一種光頭筆寫字在臘板上，這種筆另一頭是平的，寫錯了，可以用牠把臘磨平，重新寫過。（七）到了中世紀，人們都用羊皮紙·和蘆筆來寫字了。（八）我們中國人老早就用毛筆來寫字，牠是用羊·狼·兎·等動物的毛製成的。（九）蘆筆之後，又發明了羽筆。（十）鉛筆·（十一）石筆·（十一）鋼筆，這些都是後來發明的。（十三）（十四）最近又出現了打字機和自來水筆。至此，人類寫字的方法更快更便利了。</p>

<p>— 金鏞</p>
<p>在一個春光明媚的早晨。阿德的妹妹－－文倩要阿德和伊拍皮球。</p>
<p>「不高興，常常拍皮球有什麽好玩呢？」</p>
<p>阿德表示不滿意說：</p>
<p>「那麽玩甚麽呢？」文倩挺起了嘴，很不開心地說。」</p>
<p>阿德想了一會說：「還是放風箏吧。朱先生上次不是說－－放風箏是遊戲中最好的一種。妹妹你記得嗎？」</p>
<p>於是，阿德跑到一家紙紥店裏去，化了他平日所積蓄的糖果費－－二角，買了一頂老人鷂，繋上了繩和文倩一同到門前的空塲上去放了。</p>
<p>風不住的把風箏向上推着。一會，巳飄盪在天空了。</p>
<p>「怎麽！風箏會飛到空中去的。别的怎麽不能呢？」</p>
<p>文倩快活而帶些驚奇的問：</p>
<p>「妹妹，你不要着急，待我慢慢的說與你聽。」</p>
<p>於是，阿德一面放，一面講給伊聽：　　「你曉得麽？飛機，它不是靠着推進機，發出風來把它推上去的嗎？風箏呢，也是一樣的道理由風把它推上去的，假如你把繩拉得重一些，風受到了壓力，於是發生出一種强大的力向上托，風箏也就不斷的向上······」</p>
<p>這時候，文倩也曉得放風箏的原理了。伊覺得放風箏是很有趣的，從此，不再噪着要和伊哥哥拍皮球了。</p>

<p>— 劍芬</p>
<p>朋友：功課明瞭</p>
<p>的方法，據我過</p>
<p>去的經騐，把它寫在下面：當先生講的時候，第一要專心的聽，腦子裏不要思想到别種功課：因爲腦在運手的時候，是不能騒擾它的。譬如在聽講的時候，這時候就是腦在運用；如果這時再想别種的功課，非但先生所講的，一些不能映進腦海；就是所想的功課，也不能得到了解的結果。所以第一要專心聽，使先生所講的一切，完全映進腦海。第二就是在聽講的時候，巳經明瞭的功課當然不必說；如果遇着先生講了以後，仍舊有不明瞭的地方，可以把它記好，或用筆記着，仍舊聽先生講下去，等到先生把功課講完了以後，隨卽把剛纔不明瞭的地方，提出來細問先生，問到明瞭爲止。不過要注意的：不要只顧聽，而遇着不明瞭的地方就含糊過去：不要在先生講的時候不聽，而到先生講完了功課，也無從問起。�</p>
<p>小朋友：希望你們能够「聽」「問」並施。那未無論什麽功課，没有不明瞭的道理。</p>

<p>我是一隻母牛，住在一個風景很美麗的鄉村中農夫的牛欄裏。我有主人與主母，還有一個小主人，我的主</p>
<p>人和主母待我很是慈善，小主人也非常愛我，常常舞弄我頭上的角。</p>
<p>每天早上　，主人必帶了我和我的兩個同伴，到一個熱鬧的市塲裏去榨我們的乳，供給一般人們的飲料，下午便到田中去幇助主人工作，翻鬆泥土，很努力的盡職務，所以主人非常的歡喜我。</p>
<p>我的兩個同伴，因爲常常偷懶，得不到主人的歡心，常常受到主人的鞭打。他们兩個見主人這樣的愛我，非常妬忌。一天，向我問道：「你我是同類，因何主人這歡喜你不歡喜我們呢？」我說：「主人豢養我們，爲是要我們耕田，像你們這樣的「食焉而怠其事，」主人當然不歡喜的；我希望你們從此以後，努力盡職，博主人的歡心」。</p>

<p>— 彤華</p>
<p>國際聯盟婦孺保護諮詢委員會，於去年派遺調查團考察遠東，其結果，製成一報告書，述叙東方販賣婦女的情形，列舉販賣婦女最多的國家，第一爲中國，次之爲日本，次之爲朝鮮，馬來，安南，暹羅，斐律濱等處較少，小亞細亞和近東各處亦有販賣婦女的情事，這種販賣，主要是把被賣者作爲娼妓，調查團提出七種辦法，防止遠東各地販賣婦女的方法，其主要之點，爲廢止發給執照，或公認的　寮，特别注意香港與上海；設置婦女販賣總取締機關，嚴行監禁，與日内瓦密切合作，互通聲氣。</p>
<p>據上月十一日國民社電，國聯又决議將全球之娼寮，一律禁絕，以免冉有販賣婦女之事，其辦法爲通知各國當局，不發給執照，使娼業失去其法律上之保障；禁娼之後，各予以正當的職業，使彼等成爲良民。</p>
<p>國聨這一次的决議，比較去年遠東婦女調查團之主張，是稍爲進步的。雖則同以�</p>
<p>不發執照爲禁娼的第一個辦法，然而前者却注意到「如於禁娼之後，而能各與以正當之職業，則彼等自不難成爲良民。」但在國聯這兩種辦法之下，販賣婦女與賣淫制度是否能跟着這一張官樣文章而馬上消滅，這是很討論的。</p>
<p>娼妓是不能跟着賣淫之不公開而消滅的。公倡雖廢，私娼必將因而發達，私娼發達則販賣婦女之事，自必依然進行。爲什麽有人願當私娼，爲什麽有人願意出賣妻女，這是萊茵湖畔的紳士們所不懂的，因此，他們所决定的辦法，自然不免於隔靴掻癢了。現在，瓖我來說一說它的原因吧！</p>
<p>現制度的生產，是剩餘價値之再生產。在這種生產制度之下，財富的堆積，伴着窮困的堆積。一面少數的窮著極樂的有閒者一面有多數不能及時結婚的勞動者，及失去生活資料的，失業與無業的女人，在這種情形之下，有淫樂的人，有滿足性要求的人，亦有被迫以性換生活的人，性道德的矛盾配合着經濟制度的矛盾，賣淫制度便必然存在了，販賣婦女作娼妓的事情，亦就必然發生了。倍倍爾說：「婚</p>
<p>姻是市民世界的性生活的」面，其他一面就是賣淫。婚烟是盾的表面，賣淫是盾的裏面，男子社會不能在婚烟裏得到滿足，照例是向賣淫者去尋補償。」所以「賣淫是市民社會的一種必然的制度。」</p>
<p>西歐資產階級征掠落後民族的酷殘的事實，可用　森堡的經濟學入門中所舉的例子作證：</p>
<p>「因食物的缺乏，與親子訣别的悲傷，所以被囚的大部份的土人，都在克馬利港的途中死亡了。奴隸中因疲勞的關係，有不能與同伴一樣速度前者，西班牙人以爲彼等留後，有向前攻撃他們的憂慮，於是以匕首剌其背，而將他們很慘酷的虐殺了。如此不幸的生物，全身赤祼祼的，旣疲且傷，又因飢餓，幾不能起立，目覩這種慘狀，誠有心胸欲裂的光景。更用鐵鎖縛着他們的乎和足。少女中無一不遭這般强盜（西班牙人）們的暴行，供其荒淫而犧牲，所以多數的少女，皆巳染上海毒，成爲永久的痼疾。····一旦作奴隸的土人，都被他們以赤熱的鐵印，在身上烙上記號。有時奴隸之一部，被隊長掠去後，分配於兵卒之間。兵士以他們充賭品，或賣與西班牙的移民。商人們以他們作商品，與葡萄酒，麵粉，砂糖，及其他日用品相交換，而送到西班牙的殖民地中最需奴隸的部分去。在輸送中，商人將奴隸幽閉船底，不給與坐位，更不給與新空氣，和飲水，遂使他們斃命。」</p>
<p>這種絕無人道的搶奪，現在在表面上，雖然没有，然而實際是未嘗消滅的。遠東婦女調查團所稱中國是販賣婦女最多的國家，就是一個好例證。國際帝國主義爲欲保持中國之落後，一面維護封建勢力，一面進行經濟侵略。尤其這次世界恐慌以來，各國之跌價傾銷，更加速中國國民經濟之崩潰。農村方面因重重的剝削，水草，樹葉，麥苗，樹皮，便成爲農民充飢的妙品，賣兒鬻女便成爲他們飲鴆止渴的辦法了。「在陜西，十飲齡的孤女，鬻銀一二元，苦無受主：在浙江泉州一帶，八歲的小姑娘連中人錢在内祇賣二十二塊，十歲的亦僅賣五十塊。」其在城市方面，幼稚的工業，早不經帝國主義的一撃，絲廠，紗廠，樹膠和火柴廠等之停工關門，使大批失業的女工，無路可走。廣東順德各處因絲業衰敗，二十餘萬女工遂流落廣州�</p>
<p>，過着女傭或秘密賣淫的生活，便是一例。「就是能受麗於工商業或家庭的婦女，她們的工資也不會優厚，而不能用以維持一家的生活：於是在生活的負擔過於繁重，遠過於她們的微薄的工資所能供應時，她們應付困難的唯一辦法，也就是賣淫，以　補充。」在這種情形之下，中國各地賣淫的婦女，便有很大的數目了。就公私�</p>
<p>娼的人數說，上海一埠就在六萬以上十萬以下，南京折私娼就有三千餘，北平的公娼便有二千餘；漢口的公娼亦達一千七百三十五人，而這二處的私娼數倍於公娼，尙不計算在内，至於有一千左右的公私娼的城市，那是不可勝紀的。這種現象是何從發生的呢？難道不是帝國主義與封建勢力所造成的嗎？</p>
<p>矛盾的社會組織，必然產生這種黑暗的現象，以這種予盾的社會制度的前提，必然找不出解决的辦法。試問一紙通命怎能廢止販賣人口？怎能廢止賣淫制度呢？從其所謂善後的辦法來說，三千多萬失業的工人，成千萬的飢寒的人們，巳使各個資本主義國家都無所擔手足了，何能爲那些巳堕入火坑的婦女設法？德國希脫拉巳採取使婦女從職業回到家庭之辦法以解决男工之失業問題了，何能爲那些賣淫過活的娼妓謀正當職業？所以第二個辦法，亦是不兌現的空頭支票，根據以上種種，國聯這種决議，只是一種無補於事實的空論而巳。</p>

<p>— 華</p>
<p>五叔本</p>
<p>叔本華（ＡｒｔｈｕｒＳｃｈｏｐｅｎｈａｎｈａｕｅｒ）是德國的一個唯心派哲學家，而且是個悲觀主義者，生於一七八八年，死於一八六零年。我們以前講的幾位英法思想家，都是熱烈的主張女性平權的人，但叔本華這位思想家，却是極端辱駡女性的。他的「婦女論」（張慰慈譯，神州出版）把婦女駡得鷄狗不如。我們首先來講他反對婦女解放的幾點，然後再探討他有這種反動思想的原因。</p>
<p>第一，他根本瞧不起女子，認爲女子不配做大事。他說：「你們祇須看一看女子的形狀，</p>
<h3 id="c233">新愁碧遙 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>女子說起「愁」字，人必想着工愁善病的林黛玉式的佳人來，其實不是這話。</p>
<p>剛才前樓的主人，向娘姨使着威風怒駡，駡她爲甚麽偷跑出去終日不燒飯「他是「民八」北京學生運動時的幹員，怎能如今於有過光榮歷史的紀念日，獨自萎頓在房中餓肚？誰也要怒從中來。</p>
<p>娘姨也是一個很幹練的娘姨，在理路上她全不退讓，只聽他們主　僕倆一來一去的針鋒相對；</p>
<p>「你一定又是到甚麽王麻子那兒去了，你這混蛋！一</p>
<p>「先生！我如果在你這兒每月能多有三堍錢的進賬，我就不去了。」</p>
<p>「你的良心好黑！人家娘姨四塊錢一月，我巳經照數給了，你郤要我七塊錢！」</p>
<p>「我没有說定要你出七塊錢一月，不過我少三塊錢没處設法，自然要跑出去。家裏兩個男孩，寄在人家每月要付出六塊，其餘一塊錢，我要防着再生</p>
<p>下一個男的　若是女的，倒也壓死就　了。」</p>
<p>聽了這話，主人倒也怔了一下；但過了片刻，他又湧上了别種失意英雄的怒火，他說：</p>
<p>「你就要去壞事也不該不回來燒飯！而且你眞不要臉，居然承認是到王麻子那兒去了！四馬路野鷄，有時向她臉上扭一下，她還說一聲「難爲情」，你郤比她們更不怕難爲情！</p>
<p>「先生！我不回來燒飯是我錯了，不過請你原諒，我是肚皮太大；中午本想趕回來，不料一陣頭暈，昏過去了。但是你說我比四馬路的野鷄都不如，我郤不承認：她們根本没有其麽「難爲情」了，故意口上說怕難爲情，其實是更不怕難爲情。」</p>
<p>我不願再聽，把房門關了，這一陣喧吵，我的每一條神經，都給騒動了。　　這娘姨，似乎僅得代數的公式：負加正還等於零。不怕難爲情的人口說難爲情，也還是臉皮厚：「無恥之恥，是亦無恥矣。這公式反過來用，有仇加無仇國恥加無恥，也還等於零；所以五七，五九以後，雖失東北、失熱河，失····也還　没有甚麽。</p>
<p>這說法多麽的使人安慰，每人都輕了許多禦外的　担子。但「這又使不得不追恨前人：如果五四運動時一批人不那麽大喊，中國根本不會有國恥；而且那時若在巴黎和約上中國簽了名，日本也許有了二十一條的利益後客氣氣不再要我們的東北。就算要去，我們以十五年的生聚，十五的敎訓，長期抵抗的事業，現在也巳成功一半了。</p>
<p>舊恨且不去管他，這五月困人的天氣，日子長而又長，你想到大街小巷去散散步罷，會碰見許多不怕難爲情的雛妓，許多懐了大肚皮零星去賣淫的僕婦，許多潦倒肉香酒味的靑年，許多載了槍砲，水兵，洋貨的外艦，許多·····若說跑到鄉間去罷，你會在草叢之間，無意中踏着一個壓死了的女嬰兒，或是一顆有「大正」字樣的怪砲彈，或是啼啼哭哭的窮困人，或是····這些，怎能不撩起人無限的新愁呢？</p>
<p>就可以看出女子是本來不配做什麽偉大的工作</p>
<p>，無論是恩想方面或是物質方面的。···女人祇配做做我們孩兒時代的保姆和敎習，因爲她們自己是孩兒氣的，輕浮的，眼光放不遠的；簡單一旬話，她們只是做了一輩子的大小孩在小孩和成人間的一個時代。」</p>
<p>第二，他說女子的天職，是生兒，服待丈夫，管理家務。「女子應當注意家務，吃得飽飽的，穿得煖煖的，但不應當混雜在社會之中。宗敎方面的敎育應當有的，但不能讀詩文或政治，除了宗敎的或烹飪的書籍之外，其餘書籍一槪不准讀。」</p>
<p>第三，他反對男女平權，其理由是：「在這一夫一妻制度盛行的世界，一個人結婚以後，他的權利减少了一半，他的義務都增加了一倍。法律旣給了女子和男子同等的權利，法律也得要給她們一種男性的知識。但法律所給予女子的尊榮和權利却超過了造物主所給與她們的，法律愈結得多，能够享受這種權利的女子數目也愈少：所有其餘的女子的天然權利，也就�</p>
<p>被上級的幾個剝奪去了。」</p>
<p>第四，他主張女子不應當有繼承權。其理由是：「財產是由男子辛辛苦苦經過極長的時期受了極大所痛苦才得到的，假使這筆財產以後到了女子手裏，她們是不知金錢的價値的，糊</p>
<p>裏糊塗的就在極短的時期之内花完了，那是多末不應該，但這類事情却又時常有的。爲防止這類的事，女子承受遺產的權是應當限止的。　第五，他方張一夫多妻制，其理由是：在多妻制的國家裏，每個女子都有了主，但在一夫一妻制的國家裏，出嫁女子的數目是有限的，因之便留下了大羣没有地方住又没有人養活的女子。此等女子，若是她們是屬於上等社會的，就苟安度生，變成無用的老不姐；若是下等社會的，就要去做那種她們所不配做的苦工；或者變成娼妓，其生活是苦不堪言，旣没有快樂，又没有尊榮。「所以，從女子全體方面着想，多妻制確是一種眞正的利益。並且從那一方面着想，假使一個男子的妻是有老病的，或者是不能生育的，或者是太老了，爲什末他不能再娶第二個呢？」</p>
<p>叔本華的這些言論，在我國的目前還可找出好多好多同情者來。然歷史車輪是在不息的前進着。上述叔氏的每項意見，現在巳經都被事</p>
<p>實推翻了，這里用不着我們徒費筆墨，再去駁他。這兒値得我們注意的，與叔氏同一時代的英法大思想家，大抵是主張婦女解放的。爲什末叔氏的見解則如斯守舊而反動呢？</p>
<p>人們的意志並不决定他們的生活，返之，他們在社會中的生活却决定人們的意志。叔本鞾的這種反動守舊思想的根源，自然應求之於當時生長他的德國社會經濟狀况和他個人的生活環境中。那時德國還是十足的封建制度，經濟生活還滯留在農奴制之上，男尊女卑和宗法觀念籠罩着整個社會：且叔本華又是生長於地主的家庭，凡此一切不能不反映在叔氏的思想上。</p>
<p>其次叔氏的整個思想體系是反動的，唯心的，悲觀的。他認爲世界只是人們的意志和觀念；生活是一種虚榮和雜亂，生物在其中相互鬥爭，相互摧殘；要解脫生存地獄，只有克服求生志向，只有受痛苦，他的這種思想，也不能不决定他對婦女問題抱一種守舊的態度。</p>
<p>第三，他的生活，也是很偏僻孤獨的。他的一生没有一個知巳朋友，不論男的或女的。他只有一個狗，隨時不離開他。他的這種孤獨生</p>
<p>活，也是使他輕視婦女，反對婦女解放的一個重大原因。</p>
<p>這兒，我們由叔本華和以前所述幾個思想家的思想體系和其對婦女問題的意見，可得個原則上的結論：凡是思想守舊的，必定是反對婦女解放：反之，凡是主張婦女解放的，其全部思想亦必進步。這一結論，我們在以後更可得到充足的證據的·</p>

<p>— 碧雲</p>
<p>－－從歷史上了解婦　女與法律的關係</p>
<p>我們首先得問問：究竟什麽呌做法律？一般法律學家或法律哲學家大都認定法律是「調節」人與人之間的關係之一種「規範」，保護「人民」的固有權利及制裁侵犯這種權利的有效工具。所以他們歌頌法律是神聖的，人民在法律面前的「平等」是眞正的平等。但從現代的社會科學觀點看來，所謂法律，事實上不過是在一定社會内支配經濟政治的一層人用以保護自己的特殊權利之一種複雜的手段而巳。很顯然的，在這種冠冕複雜的手段之下，有無數的人在供着犧。不用說，當被犧牲者起來抗議或要求法律注意他們的權利時，法律有時也不能不向他們表示一點讓步。這就是說，法律隨着歷史的前進，不能不逐漸地想當放寛牠所保護的範圍和縮小牠所制裁的權限。所以從歷史上說來，法律本身亦是一種進化的東西，甚至能正確地反映社會進化的階段和社會關係的深度。</p>
<p>法律從何時起才與婦女生關係　？要回答這個問題，不能不回顧一下歷史。我們知道，人類社曾經有一個時期，而且是很長很長的時期，是没有法律的。那就是原始社會和氏族共有制社會。那時人們旣是共同生產共同消費，人與人間不平等的現象還未曾發生。人們生活在大自然的懐抱之中，相互間的關係異常簡單，因而便根本不需要那種冠冕而複雜的「調節器」－－法律。但是那時的人們－－婦女在同内－－相互間　是眞正的平等。自從封建的魔鬼把始的社會組織變更以後，他們憑着殘酷的武力搶刦了大多數人的財產，并創造了�</p>
<p>一種政治權力，第一次將人類分成爲剝削者與被剝削者，和壓迫者與被壓迫者的各種等級，同時婦女亦一般地被賤視與被壓迫之列。魔鬼們爲了在被剝削者和被壓迫者面前證明自己的特殊權利之正當，於是破題兒創造了法律，而法律也就第一次光顧到婦女們的頭上。自然，封建社會裏的法律只是一個極粗野的雛形，大都是混合着當時傳統的習慣，宗敎的敎條和封建主義的命令，與現代的法律距離很遠。因此，那時的法律所給予婦女的，不是保護怒她們的權利，而是殘酷的懲罰和横暴的侮辱。例如我國舊時對巳嫁女了子之「七出」之條，其對於女子之横暴殘忍，實等於一架絞殺機，在這絞殺機上犧牲了的婦女不知有多少哩</p>
<p>然而，由於歷史不懈地前進！十八世紀在英國發生子產業革命，同時在法國爆發了民主主義的大革命，這才給人類史上開了一個新紀元。一方面產業革命的鉅腕將婦女從狹隘的悲慘的古舊家庭的鐵鎖之下解放出來，送她們到各種的生產事業中獨立工作，并介紹她們逐漸　�</p>
<p>走入各種社會職業，這樣，便給了一部分婦女在經濟上取得了相當的獨立地位，另一方面，法國革命的民主主義的炸彈，猛烈地轟毁了幾百年來野蠻的專制主義：在政治上也高舉起之「人生而有自由平等之權（「權宣言」第一條）的旗幟，并標出「人人在法律面前平等」的原則，這時婦女才第一次公開被承認與男子平等，在法律上得與男子享受同等的權利。這總算是一個偉大的進步！但自此以後，實際上婦女從法律方面究竟獲得了些什麽？究竟是否從此就得到完全的解放？這是一個値得研究的問題，本文爲篇幅所限，只好就此結束！</p>

<p>春假開始的上一天，到一個小學校去接回寄宿着的大兒，和敎師們談話之間，得知他近來很有點行爲不檢，（據說敎師們是不便對家屬公然說到「偷竊」這兩個字的，在那張學月通訊錄上，也只輕描寫的塡着一隨意拿人之物」，但實際，正要家屬體會到這「偷竊」的意義。）這消息，眞使掙扎於貧困下而想做個淸白人的我感到異常的羞憤。很想回來時馬上雷厲風行的給他一點顏色看，但轉念到七八歲的小孩旣不懂得理義之辦，又生在物質誘惑强大的環境中，威嚇不如理喻。</p>

<p>— 宋芬</p>
<p>編者按：本篇是一位讀者當面交給編者的，他說，因爲看到近日中國局勢的日趨險惡，實在再也按不住他的憤慨情緒了，他說，這篇短文是他以至高至純的愛國熱誠寫成的，他希望讀者的嚴正批評，更望能引起讀者的共嗚。我們對宋君的意見是有絕對的同感，並深信讀者也是如此，不過同時我們更要想到的，卽祇是激昻的憤慨又有什麽用呢！我們最需要的是設法使全國民衆能積極的奮起，督促政府做政府的後盾來打開這個沉悶的難關。</p>
<p>翻開五一那天的報紙，眼底巳盡是驚心怵目的消息，好像是展開着一幅破碎悽慘的中國現狀圖。</p>
<p>自九一八以還，逆來順受的政策，結果不僅是美國遠東問題專家皮遜氏在外交政策恊會上正式報告中所說的：「日本最近侵佔滿洲與熱河，土地之廣，實與一八四二年英國併呑香港以來九十年間，中國所失去之二百四十萬方哩相等」。這老實還是安慰我們愛虚面子的貴同胞呢！我們如果不願自欺欺人，承認事實，把日本實際統治的華北，英國奪去的西康和班洪，日英搗亂並企圖建立回敎獨立國的新疆，法國佔領的瓊南九島，以及英國在川粤法國在滇桂支配�</p>
<p>勢力的加强，美國在全國航空及一般交通事業上的壟斷，尤其四月十七日日本外務省代言人獨佔中國的公開宣言·····把這一切事實暫時結筆總賬，便知亡</p>
<p>國滅種的慘禍，早巳是我們三年來的切膚之痛，兒孫未出世，奴隸的命運巳經被敵人安排齊備了。</p>
<p>像本日專電，立法委員某君的觀察：「中國短期内决不致亡國，良以國家過大，日本不論如何終不能一口呑下」，巳是瞎子算命；至於日本「侵略益甚，方可激發民氣」的論調，好像暴日恣情的侵凌和我們自己的婢膝奴顏還未到功德圓滿的境地似的，這簡直是「亡國之音」－</p>
<p>這類含垢忍辱的思想的散佈，和日本修正聲明的手段，目的完全相同：騙我們低首下心地走進萬刦不復的殖民地地獄！要知，卽令日本聲明的修正是出於眞誠，也是來緩和歐美的空氣，一種和平分贓的辦法。英外相在下院宣布的明明白白：「在華均等權利及原則，九國公約巳以極明白詞句擔保之」，除「日本所有之特殊權利爲他國所承認者外」，「不能承認日本有單獨决定任何特殊舉動如銀行團之權」。這裏九國公約的援引，目的不是保障中國領七的完整，而是宰割中國這隻肥羊，大家都有份，日本不該獨呑。「英國府决計就最大之範圍，並以國際合作之精神，襄助中國向和平與繁榮及趨向遠東和諧與好意之進步」云云，這是西門的外交辭令，譯成日用語，就是：在日本獨佔中國的範圍下，必須承認門戶開放原則，使歐美列强有共管中國之機會。　　日本擁有特殊權利，歐美列强擁有一般權利，做奴隸的總是中國是中國人！在日本獨佔下，中國亡國，中國人做奴隸；在列强共管下，中國依然亡國，中國人依然做奴隸。中國人的我們，到底是做那一種奴隸呢？或者，我們不願做任何奴隸而自求生路呢？</p>
<p>如果四萬萬中國人不甘心做奴隸，世界上任何兇狠的敵人都没有强迫我們做奴隸的可能！過去的不抵抗，事實上招致了獨佔和共管。我們必須把亡國的「不抵抗主義」刷洗凈盡。民族唯一的生路，只有「抵抗」。他來一拳，我去一脚。對豺狠不能講道德說仁義。我們必須認淸，民族當前最大的仇敵是暴日。抵抗暴日是民族當前的最大任務。復興抵制日貨運動，來制止日貨傾銷；開展義勇軍戰爭，來趕去日本在華的浪人和退伍軍官；没收日本在華的一切企業，來回答日本强奪中國人的土地財產：動員全國兵力財力來驅逐日本在華的軍隊，收復九一八以來的一切失地。我們以神聖的自由戰爭來制止日本的暴力侵略。全國人不分彼此，認淸當前的國難，撇開一切，同心恊力專來完成一件事業：抗日求國事業！信奉一種主義：抗日救國主！有錢的出錢，有力的出力；全國上下男女老幼團結成一個對日作戰的堅强部隊，以有敵無我的精神，破釜沉舟的意志，撲滅暴日的毒燄，這是中華民族唯一的出路，勝利的出路！全國人民便須以制裁暴日的手段，來聲討這暴日的走狗！</p>
<p>全國同胞們，數千年來我們祖宗斬荊闢棘艱難締造的大好河山，傳到我們手裏，我們不能讓暴日獨佔，也不能讓國際共管！我們要拿光榮的，神聖的，理直氣將的民族戰爭，來撲滅暴日，警告列强，打開一條自由獨立的民族生路！</p>

<h3 id="c268">香作裏 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 陳哲民</p>
<p>春天是一個燒香的季節。淸明節後，怕是各寺廟中香火最盛的時候了。每年有多少金錢消耗在燒香禮佛拜天祭祖身上，雖無確切的統計，但那一定是一個異常龐大的數目是無疑的。迷信的觀念　因料學進步而稍稍消减，倒反因一部分有力者的提倡，　假有更滋蔓的趨　。�</p>
<p>海的香店香作有一點表面的觀察。上海的香店不會少過一百五十家，而南市閘北最多，浦東爛泥渡楊家渡董家渡，滬西曹家渡周家橋北新涇亦復不少。這些都是自巳有作塲的香店。從這裏我們可�</p>
<p>以毫無困難的明白中國半封建社會的本質及迷信觀念的根深蒂固了。</p>
<p>我曾參觀過幾個作塲，我覺得作香，在手工業中要算是頂辛苦頂吃力的一種工作了。那幾乎是令人不能相信的，他們的工作時間，會從午夜的一點鐘起，要到次日下午五六點，鐘，方能告一個　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一天十六小時左右的工作，因爲有多數店家的雇用他們是以「件」論値的，照件工制計算的。他們作得多可以多得點工錢，他們怎能不拚死的賣命呢。</p>
<p>有時，就是他們願意賣命，還不可得。傱香要靠天氣，假設天下雨没有太陽，香無法囇乾，是只好停手的。在新年，淸明，端節，中秋等節令中香的需要大，生產可以多些；在其餘的時間中，像六七月或九十月，香的需要少，是不須勞你辛苦的。因這些原因，他們平均一個月只有二十天左右的工好做呢。　　香的工作過程是異常不衛生和十分吃力的。最早的一步是配香。按照香的種類精粗，把適當的原料酌匀；這時香粉（非小姐太太們用的香粉）的霧會絲毫無情的向你的鼻孔，你的嘴　，你的眼晴擈撃過來，使得你吐不過氣，張不開嘴，開不開眼晴。他們必須熟悉各種原料和配合法。原料的種類有好幾種，成分最多的是末香：其次榆未（價値比末香約貴一倍多），是用來增加香的粘性的，柏末是用來使香的顏色好看及增加香味的。還有　和木屑子的，這是因爲木屑便宜，可以减少一點成本－這些熟習了以後，才能希望做得　　　　　　則做出來的香不好，老板不但在工錢上將有所推敲扣算，還要把那不好的香毁掉重作，使你幸苦過多時的血汗化爲烏有。</p>
<p>原料配好以後，就遇到了一種最嚴重的工作了。那是攙和水分以後的調匀工作。他們和那調粉作饅頭的大師傅一樣必須把各種原料左揉右揉；而那香槽裏吸取他們精力的物事又是那樣多，非得他們光着赤膊（雖在冬天也如此），用盡平生之力，繼續三四水時以上的奮力是不克奏功的。你可以看到他們全身上冒着蒸氣：雖然粗壯的肌肉充滿了力的表現，但你一看到他們喘得一歇不停，你就知道這不是一種可等閒視之的工作了。</p>
<p>這常是不午應作的事。揉好了放在露天的空氣裏嚗曬着，以後他們可去用晚飯睡眠去了。他們是六七點鐘就去安睡的，因爲午夜一點鐘的抽香工作又在等待他們呀。這個工作是比較不吃力的，只是把香塊子抽成一根根的香條子，放在香架上，等待早晨的太陽來把牠曬乾。不過長時間幹這機械單調得要命的事，會把你的手弄酸，背鬱痛的！</p>
<p>他們的技藝對於工資是很有關係的。上海的香比内地講究得多，種類也多，普通的若綫香，棵香，盤香，壽字香，蚊虫香·····每一類裏面又有種種不同，這些技藝不是每一個香師傅都曉得且精到的。比如蚊虫香許多人就不會做或做得不好。所以技藝上很有些等級。手藝頂好的呌「上莊」，差點的呌「二莊」，其次就是學徒。每天辛苦所得，上莊約五角，二莊四角左右，學徒是照例無薪的。上莊每月平均工作二十天，約可得大洋十元。</p>
<p>此外，還有一種包香工人，是大香店爲要大量生產好批發給烟紙店南貨店而雇用的。他們的報酬是每包一棵香給銅板一枚。他們每天可包五六百棵，不是差不多每天可得大洋二元子嗎？非也，並没有那末多的香給他包，香店决不會使牠的賬房先生，店員，學徒在櫃臺上閒空的，這種包香工作是求過於供的時候才得有的。</p>
<p>說到他們的飲食，則我要指出黃魚，菠菜，豆腐，靑菜，鹹菜等是最好的。至於娛樂，則除了在陰雨天玩玩幾百錢輸赢的紙牌而外，其餘就什麽也没有了。</p>

<p>立的地位。在此「内憂外患」的局面下，日本除積極走上戰爭的道路，以圖最後一拚外，便是盡力設法利用其太平洋上之兩大敵人－－英美之衝突，以實現獨霸東亞的野心。</p>
<p>但是，不管怎樣，日本在中國過分的行動，英美對之都是　到極大的不安的。日本爲要緩和其與英美的衝突，並使英美間的衝突增長而從中取利，便不惜以花言巧語去與華盛頓作友好談判，與不列顚作商務的交涉。待到英日，日美談判有了結果，所謂東京的外交勝利後，日本便不進一步試探英美對牠的態度是否一致。巧國聯正於此時與中國進行「技術合作」，英美等國的銀行團正在與中國籌劃民立白銀公司，商議對華投資，「帮助中國建設」等問題，不邀日本參與；這當然給與了。日本一個借口。於是霹靂一聲，四月十七日本外務省發表了「對華宣言」，表明其在東亞之「特殊地位」，反對列强　共管或瓜分中國一的企圖。</p>

<p>在一個濃蔭的花園的門口，一個紅頰的小女孩，名呌搿利亞的在哭着：「我不要離開這裏。」三月前，一個蒼白而衰弱的女孩也就在這同一的門口哭過，她那時是怎麽樣也不肯進去的。</p>
<p>「爲什麽李逹，瓦利亞和科利亞可以在這森林學校裏住呢？我也不想回家去！」</p>
<p>這哭着的孩子的母親不知所措了，但她仍然是高興的，因爲在這個森林學校療養所住了三個月，她的六歲的女兒是足足增加了十磅的體重。</p>
<p>她不想回家去，因爲她在這兒過得十分快活。那些有敎養的保姆給她鉛筆，書籍，敎她去畫火車。搿利亞巳經能够認得她�</p>
<p>寢室裏掛着的「新鮮空氣，太陽和飲料給我們健康，標語了。每天早晨，搿利亞不驚醒别人，輕輕地爬到兎籠去，這些兎有着强傷害其在中國之所謂「特殊權利」，這正如英美之不滿於日本的掠奪東北一樣，是帝國主義在華的利害衝突的表現；同時，在這中間，日本更是在以驚人的言論，强硬的語調，以試探英美對牠的態度是否一致，而决定其方策。起初，倫敦方面好像從天空中降下了一顆巨大的炸彈樣，對日本的對華宣言表示非常的驚異，但華盛頓的空氣却很冷靜：待到日本將其對華宣言解釋並表面地取消其原來立塲後，英外相西門便覺「事件巳告了一叚落」，但美國却反而表示了嚴重的態度，正式照會日本，反對「東亞門羅主義」，重申九國公約。－－這是很顯明地表示了英美對日態度之不一致，表示了日本試探的初步成功。日本之遲遲不發表其聲明與不回答美之照會者，卽是因其看到英美對牠態度巳開始表示出了不一致的情勢，而要想靜待英美衝突之增長，以便從中取利。</p>
<p>如果英美對日的態度始終不能一致，那，本帝國主義必將用盡一切手叚向中國作猛烈的進攻，壓迫中國脫離英美的覊絆，而完全受東京的支配。因爲狡</p>
<p>詐的日本帝國主義雖欲將英美勢力驅逐於中國之外而獨霸東亞，但其在没有萬分必要時絕不會親自出馬，以武力與英美鬥爭，必然是壓迫中國不接受英美之侵略政策，乃至反對英美與别的帝國主義，而完全受制於日本，這樣，如其成功，當然便是是本完全勝利，如其失敗，受禍的也是中國，與之無干。最近日本的向華北增兵，向中國提出直接交涉，在常熟開砲，····所有這些，都是其這一陰謀的具體表現。</p>
<p>在此情形下，中國怎樣辦呢？求救於英美嗎？牠們也和日本一樣，是帝國主義者，是隨時都在没法瓜分或共管乃至獨佔中國的。所以我們惟一的出路，是在於我們自己的奮鬥，如果自己不起來，而要去靠任何。一個帝國主，來投救，那結果便是做亡國　！</p>

<p>— 夢白</p>
<p>德　在國社黨主政之下，對於救濟失業問題，也非常注意，而且自從展開了救濟失業運動的序幕之後，巳有相當的成效。我們回想起來，一九三三年的正月，那時統計的結果，德國的失業工人總數是六，○○○，○○○人，然而眼前祇有三，二五○，○○○人，而且德政府自本年三月二十一日起，第二度救濟失業工人運動幕展而後，在企望之中，更可减少失業工人二百萬。�</p>
<p>據國社黨宣傳委員的報告，自德國舉行救濟失業工人運動而後，工商業破產的紀錄巳低减百分之四十六，僅就一九三三年的一年之中；商品的銷售，一九三三年也经比較一九三二年超過百分之十二；工廠方面的轉機，到一九三三年的年底爲止，也比一九三二年底增加一四○，○○○，○○○馬克的資本；毛織業一九三二年增加六十四億馬克，而一九三三年增加七十一億。</p>
<p>就上文所述，德國在厲行救濟失業工人運動之下，工商業的極度發展，直接間接，巳都足使失業工人减少。回頭看到我們中國，農村破產，工商業不景氣，失業的人數巳超過全世界任何邦國，而政府方面，社會方面，都没有救濟失業工人的方法，�</p>
<p>和德國相形之下，眞令人感慨系之呢！</p>

<p>— 林可人</p>
<p>本來，經商是致富之道，只要生意　得　，就可以做陶朱公的。但是，日前的情形却　有點特别，許多對於生意經研究有素的商人，許多老牌商店，不僅賺不到錢，作不成富家翁，而且還一天一天地在那裏鬧不景氣，甚至走上破產的窮途。據報載：廢曆年節以後，上海的一般商店都有不能撑持之勢。其中不僅有許多牌面稍次的商店宣告停業，而且還有幾家關係大局之大商店也在無法支持中，若非法院顧全市面，恐怕早巳因債務關係宣告淸理了。至於外埠，因爲工商業没有上海的發達，一切都較上海爲不便利，其商業更是凋敝不堪的。單是徐州一處，由於大批的商店裁員和停業的結果，失業的店員就有三四千人之多－－這是什麽原因呢？一句話說完，因爲目前正是恐慌之年：在此恐慌之年中，就是做生意也是很困難的。</p>
<p>現在　　　地來談吧。</p>
<p>首先，經　，卽是做生意，必須要有人照顧。所謂　通生意絕者，便是善於做買賣，善於對付顧客的人。如果一家商店，没有生意，那便只有關門大吉。目前的中國，因爲農村經濟的破產，一般購買力的銳减，各種商店的顧客也就一天一天地减少了。在此情形下，如果一個商家還是依照平常做生意的方法，每一種商品必須要獲得好多利潤才賣，那便會要遭到舗面冷落的危險。一旦舗面冷落，商品　不出去，便會要使得現金缺少，經濟不能流通，以致走上破產的窮途。因此，一般商家爲要繁榮門</p>
<p>面，活動現金，便不得不減低物價，實行商業競爭。於是，四個銅板買五尺布，兩個銅板買枝鉛筆，三角小洋稱幾斤書·····等現象便發生了。但是，就在這樣的商業競爭中也不見得能使生意興旺起來；同時，商家的貨物也是用錢買來的，要是在此競爭中不能獲得一點利潤，甚至還要損失血本，那終於也只有關門了事。－－這是在現狀下生意不好做的第點。</p>
<p>其次，中國交通旣不便利，一切貨物的運輸都很困難；再加以各地苛捐雜稅的繁重，生產方法的幼稚，便搆成了中國的一切貨物的過高成本。成本旣高，購買者又少，而　業　　　是那樣尖銳，在此情形下來做生意，恐怕就是最懂生意經的商界天才，也是不能做陶朱公的罷。</p>
<p>同時，一般商家都要依靠錢莊銀行的借貸，才能周轉。要是錢業家和銀行界來一個特别穩定的政策，比較少有保障者便不放欵，那有許多資本不甚雄厚的商家便只有死路一條。但是不幸，今春以來，錢業家和銀行界，因爲看到了商業凋敝的情形，便就眞的來了一個特别穩定的政策，非有特殊保證的商家便不放欵。於是，商店關門的現象，便就比比皆是了。－－這是在現狀下生意不好做的第三點。</p>
<p>此外，帝國主義者之利用種不平等條約的保障，無限制地在我國傾銷商品，更是我們的工商業凋敝，生意不好做的主要原因。</p>
<p>生意困難，便是商業凋敝的表現；商業凋敝，當然與工業的危機有莫大的關係；工商業的危機，農村經濟的破產，便是我們的國民經濟破產的實情，所謂民生凋敝，社會不安的原因就在這裏。但是，怎樣辦呢？我對此没有具體意見，我只知道這些都是現狀下的中國的產兒。</p>
<p>言論</p>
<h3 id="c273">讀「中國銀行營業報告」以後 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 魯庸</p>
<p>中國銀行是國内最大的銀行之一，牠的民國二十二年度的營業報告，巳於日前在報端發表，其中除載有該行營業槪况等外，並詳述國民經濟的各部門，這裏，不僅使我們看到銀行業的畸形發展，同時還可以看出一般經濟低下的情况。茲將其分析於後：</p>
<p>一，銀行業的畸形發展－在此百業凋疲之際，銀行業却獨能赢利，這不容我們不加以注意。中國銀行二十二年度的營業槪况，單以存欵與放欵而論，其「各項存欵總餘額爲五三九，二八四，五二七，一六，較二十一年度計增加六二，七三六，四七三，七三；各項放欵總餘額爲三五一，三八八，六○九，一五，較二十一年度計增加二八，四九七，三九一，三三。」業務的特别發達，可以槪見。其他上海華商銀行，亦莫不一致發達。據該報告末端所載：「上海華商銀行二十年度發行額爲四萬五千四百十四萬三千一百六十五元，較二十一年增二千三百餘萬元；存欵總額約計爲二十一</p>
<p>萬萬元，較二十一年約增一萬萬元。」且，添設新銀行六家，原有銀行增設分支行辦事處十六家。　然「然以乏優良厚利之投資而傾向於公債寺產；其注意於商業者，亦以放欵途徑之狹隘，於欠戶信用押品折扣，不暇審愼選擇；不合理之信用膨脹日甚一日。」此實足道出銀行業的畸形發展。</p>
<p>誰都知道：年來銀行業的投資，視工商業如畏途，農村更不必說。所以，「社會僅有之資金，悉爲厚利之公債所吸收，而人人歎息痛恨於建設生產資金之缺乏。」另一方面，游資的充斥，亦非社會富力之增加，此乃由於農村騒動的擴大，一般土著的富有者均將其大量的金錢往都市輸送，且視存放銀行，獲取低微利息爲穩妥。但此種游資集中銀行以後，卽轉投於公債地產。所以銀行業的獲利，全在這兩方面，換句話說，公債的發行與游資的集中，實爲銀行業畸形發展的源泉。</p>
<p>二，一般經濟低下的狀况－中國是以農爲本的國家，所以農業實佔國民經濟的主要都門。農產方面，二十二年度的食糧收獲，據各方面統計全國平均總數比十一年少百分之六，其他如棉花，茶葉，烟草等增减不一。因此，農產物進口，仍達四萬萬元之鉅。所以農村表敗，達於極點。然其衰敗的原因雖有下列之多：卽一（一）農產價格之慘落；（二）農民負担之有增無减；（三）外國農產品跌價之反響；（四）農產收獲量之不豐。」但本年政府及社會方面對於減輕農產成本及提高農產價格之設施，實屬不多。這可以下列事實來證明：卽：（一）政府通令消苛捐雜稅；但各省尙未有减低或取消之切實舉動。（二）金融機關提倡農民放欵：各銀行或則設農業食庫，試辦小額放欵；或則提倡合作社之間接放欵；但總額不足六七百萬元。（三）政府議征收洋米進口稅，但洋米入口最多之廣東廣西福建，尙未實行征收。至若中央及各省辦理農業改進之機關，其數量雖如下：行政及設計四六；試騐及研究一六一；推廣三○農業金融五八。但所辦各種機關，類皆經費拮据，規模狹隘，力量有限，進行遲緩。所謂復興農村之成績，如此而巳。</p>
<p>同樣，工業亦一蹶不振。「以全般工業論，二十二年度可稱工業界困苦時期之開始。一其實去年的工業，因受農村衰敗及世界經濟恐慌的影響，巳表現急速的衰退。我們單以去年的紗廠减工與絲廠停閉而論，也就可以看出其衰退的程度。至於其他大小工業，亦莫不實行緊縮，藉圖渡過這一難關。但這不啻是一種夢想，何况中國的工業，尚有另外的阻力，無時不受二重威脅，卽在中國設外國工廠之競爭，及外國同樣進口品之傾銷。總之，中國民族工業的發展，在未排除帝國主義的勢力以前，始終要爲帝國主義的經濟所束縛。</p>
<p>此外，二十二年度的國際貿易：，進口總額爲十三萬四千五百餘萬元；出口額總爲六萬一千一百餘萬元，合計十九萬五千七百餘萬元，入超額爲七萬三千三百餘萬元。與二十一年比較，進口减百分之十八；出口減百分之二十；入超額亦减百分之十五。」此種銳减的現象，很顯明的表現出購買力的縮小與生產的不足。至入超差額之無法抵補，則於銀之出口，足以證之。</p>
<p>總之，銀行業的畸形發展，不僅對於整個國民經濟没有補救，反而足以助長社會的混亂。同時，一般經濟的低不，使生產表現不足，失業愈形增加，多數人的活都要陷於極端困苦的境地，以致無力購買其日常必需品。於是影響所及，促進國際貿易的銳减。這些整個經濟破產的形態，不能不說是一個極嚴重的問題。　　▲下轉入第五版▲</p>

<h3 id="c274">電氣養鷄法 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 因化</p>
<p>利用電熟孵化羹飼養鷄雛的方法，無疑地是一種最好的方法。這使得我們能在很短的時間内，得到一種質最精而量又多的優育食品。無論在飼養的金錢消耗上或勞力上，這種方法比任何舊式主法要經濟而有效得多。鷄雛的死亡，也可减少至最低限度。</p>
<p>雖然這種新方法的應用，在蘇聯和在别的國家一樣，是近頃的事，但這方法初期的研究實騐時期到底巳經過去，現在巳成爲蘇聯實業的一重要部門了。</p>
<p>直到一九三零年，蘇聯實際上還不曾有過一間電氣飼養室。從一九三零到一九三一年的時期中，有幾個科學的和經濟的機關作過一些關於這方面的實騐。到一九三二年這種研究才大有進步，到今日，這種實業以一種高速的</p>
<p>步調，在各地大量的發展了。</p>
<p>經騐指示着，只有把這種經營交與各地養鷄的專門機關經管，才可收到最佳的效果。在北高加索，克里米，烏克蘭等地，鷄蛋的生產是極有規律的。把這種養鷄室當作各地獨立經營的企業是表現得很合適的。</p>
<p>這一類的重要經營，在北高加索，亞美費，喬治夫斯克等地，尤其發達。這裏的電氣養鷄室平均的大小可養四萬五千到五萬頭雛鷄。在亞美費和喬治夫斯克的養鷄室，最大的，每個共可容雛鷄八萬五千頭。</p>
<p>工蘇聯現在有兩種不同的養鷄法，一種是按照鷄雛的年齡設備一種五層的養鷄室，第一層裏飼養二十天以内的雛鷄，第二和第三層飼養四十天以上的，第四層和第五層飼養六十天以上的。在五層中央通以電氣管以温暖各室。另一種方法是在一種能自由推動的木塒上裝上電綫，全塒也用電氣來使之温暖。比較上是後者來得簡便，而能爲更大量的飼養。�</p>
<p>上面所說的這種養鷄事業在蘇聯雖然是很新的，但養鷄家大可以誇口他們的努力巳有相當的成功了。比方說，在北高索的養鷄塲裏，一萬三千三百頭剛孵出的幼雛，在六十天中僅死去八百頭，不過當總數的百分之六。</p>
<p>爲了要檢查上面這種經營的成績，找出消除種種飼養上的缺陷的方法（如雛鷄的保護及食料等事），並使這種事業更普遍的發展，以及制定一些關於這一事業的管理規則等起見，好幾次會議巳由負責者，飼養工人，和各科學研究機關的代表召集過了。</p>
<p>爲了免除飼養上的困難，討論的結果，巳將雛鷄的食料。作更精密的分配，並注意雛鷄的生長各時其中不同的保護法，這些都是十分科學的。</p>
<p>蘇聯這種養鷄的活動在一九三二年巳獲得了　貴的知識和經騐，通過一九三三年更廣大更細密的注意，無疑地，將毫無困難地解决了第二五年計畫中的肉食問題。</p>

<p>鼓大眼晴瞪着臺上的「戲子」，被擠開去的退下來往「後排」，往「邊條」走，笑開了嘴臉批評着誰家姑娘打扮得入時。眼晴有點花，耳朶也不大健的老年人，旣來了，看戲可搶不過少年人，於是就乾脆坐到離「臺口」較遠的樹下或石上去找自己的老友閒談。婦女們，俏的醜的，除了較「門第八戶」的少年寡婦外，多穿着了自己最心愛的衣鞋來展覽，佇在高脚凳上看「臺上」的「小生戲花旦」，偷眼見了在端詳着自巳的「後生」時，拿起花帕兒來含羞地揑弄。小孩子成羣地攢過大人的腰肢，往「臺下小貨擔子」旁衝。人，全都那麽高興，有精神。從「開鑼」到「殺臺」，夜深了，打着「亮子」回家。明午又跟着「戲班」趕到另的鄰村。戲看得那麽高興，有精神，這是他們唯一的娛樂呵！直到「戲班子」遠去得十五六里以外，看完戲一支蠟燭趕不回家時，才若無其事地開始田事或結果冬藏。</p>
<p>社戲原是謝神敬祖的典禮，可是後來也變作一種人事了。這意義可以在「廟臺戲」與「、廠臺」的名目上來。前者是在寺廟大殿前的永久戲臺或臨時臺上演的，後者多在荒野地上的露天裏演，含有敬神意味的在臺的遠前方搭起一個廠來供奉神祇，呌「廠臺戲」，專爲人事的演戲就呌「暢臺戲」。</p>
<p>廟臺戲是土地堂，城隍廟等的開光，賽會，以及財神殿，關岳祠等的定期演戲。廠臺戲是春初演來祈禱人口太平，秋末演來報謝五穀豐登，以及養好了蠶，求得了雨，燒剩了房子的酬神戲。十幾年前農村經濟尙寛裕，農民生活還可温飽的時候，很多人事的演戲，如某姓宗祠修譜，某地望族進主時演戲來表示門第高貴，子孫昌旺。某人老年得子或大病方愈，以及高壽，升官等時際，邀班子唱幾臺戲來表示欣喜與闊綽，也有由親戚朋友送賀演的。某行業如泥水木匠，成衣帮等合攏資來唱臺戲，公訂行規，宣佈增漲工資。某處的山林，蘆蕩，桃園，果圃等等集合些錢來唱臺戲，公伸禁令，議定「違者罰戲一臺，罰酒幾席」等。這些暢臺戲的流行，非但酬神敬祖，簡直把演戲的娱樂來公開號召，用作公衆的集會了。不是嗎，終年勤勞的農民，要的是可以舒一下筋骨與精神的娛樂。至於這娛樂本身的是否有毒，甚至看完這次戲後，精神上受了某姓或某人的壓迫，和生活上增加了負擔這些，是無暇顧及的。</p>
<p>普通的一臺戲是八齣，俗稱前四回「正本」，後四回「添頭」。正本是由村莊上的紳董行生們點定，寫在水牌上掛在臺前。添頭就由本村的靑年們來酌定了，自然這一定是最合於他們胃口的，他們不像先生們的愛看列國三國，才子佳人。他們愛的是英雄好漢的打仗交結，和「小放牛」，「打花鼓」這些男女風情。紳董先生們有裝着正派不看添頭戲的。某姓修譜就鬧了點戲的笑話，原來開鑼前「拉班」的照例拿了戲單來請族長點戲，偏偏那個年尊輩長的族長却不大懂戲，看見戲單上的「翠屏山」，想起正對着宗祠門的那座據說有關風水的山來，就點定這齣戲開臺，雖然有人發見這成問題，可是碍於族長的面子不敢更改，演到潘巧雲偷了海和尙，又調戲石秀的當兒，這位族長溜了，那些靑年們就大點其潘金蓮這類的淫戲。事後某姓被駡作「演戲羞祖宗」，因爲他們恰巧姓潘。類於這種有關姓氏之戲的演出？往往會從笑話鬧成流血的慘案的，像秦姓與羅姓，曹，嚴，潘這些村莊就各有准演與不准演某戲的恊定。比如秦村不演「羅成陷沙」，只能演「羅通掃北」，羅村不點「秦瓊賣黃馬」；潘村點了「戰宛城」，「斬曹儀」或「打嚴嵩」等戲，那末曹嚴兩村人，不但要點了「活捉潘璋」或「陰審潘江」這類戲來報復，而且當時會在戲塲裏鼓噪起來，停止演戲，找着姓潘的就打，從此結下連親多不配的世仇來的。這就從看戲娛樂，轉爲嘔氣　殺了。可是酬神戲的點戲，就嚴肅與呆板得多了，比如開光賽會等的「周胡得道」與「西遊記」，求雨戲的「渭水河」與「水漫金山，蠶花戲的「嫘祖娘娘」，財神戲的「斯陀國獻寳」等都是。至於人事戲就多取吉利的戲目，如生了兒子演「九代榮忌演「殺子」「狸貓換太子」慶壽的演百壽圖」，忌演「七星坦」。這些看慣了的老戲點多了，靑年的觀衆就會感着不耐，背過臉去找打架胡調的機會來求　洩的。</p>
<p>短甲武生，小丑，旦角，和做工好的戲子最受歡迎。捧角這心情大家没有�</p>

<h3 id="c277">「阿蒲羅摩夫」的病症 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 森原</p>
<p>一阿Ｑ正傳」這部中國小說是很著名的，因爲一阿Ｑ」的病症在中國人民的每一個角落裏都隱藏着，上自朝庭，下至農舍，都有阿Ｑ先生在鎭守着。所以中國人受了欺侮，被人屠殺，或是被人奪了幾省地方，只是阿Ｑ似的，口廟說着「兒子打父親」，一面驕傲着，躱開了。</p>
<p>阿Ｑ在中國是够威風的了，不幸還有阿蒲羅摩夫作他的伴侶。</p>
<p>阿蒲羅摩夫是怎樣的一個人呢？阿蒲羅摩夫的病症和阿Ｑ的病症有些什麽不同呢？現在且來考古一下，請阿蒲羅摩夫先生出來，讓我們認識認識，也是有趣而又有意養的。　　和杜思托衣夫斯基同時代的一個俄國文學家岡恰洛夫（Ｇｏｎｈｔｃａｒｏｆｆ），寫了一部小說，呌做阿蒲羅摩夫（Ｏｂｌｏｍｏｆｌ）</p>
<p>阿蒲羅摩夫是一個俄國的貴族，有六七百農奴，中等財產。他的童年初期，把自己的創造才能完全毁滅了，一心祗夢想着伏爾迦美麗的河畔的遼闊平靜的貴族莊園，那兒没有鐵道來擾亂莊園的平靜，當地居民也没有什麽「問題」來煩擾，而阿蒲羅摩夫是被保姆，侍童，婢女，僕人供養着，他自己說：「從我最幼小的嬰孩時代起，我自己曾經動手穿過一次襪子嗎？」早餐時就准備午餐，很早吃過午飯就睡眠。　　後來阿蒲羅摩夫進了大學，忠僕跟隨着，懶惰與沉睡的空氣也跟着他。當聽了幾次講演，夜裏與另外一些年靑朋友們的奮激的談話和對於理想的或種糢糊的響往，也常常挑動這位靑年的心，但是莊園的温柔和睡眠的影響，懶惰，對於生活的平穩而又完全保證的感覺，使這些積極的美麗的印象完全消滅掉了。别的同學在他們的論爭中鬧得很熱，且加　各種團體，可是阿蒲羅摩夫却只觀望着而反問着自己：「這些到底是爲了什麽呢？」「你爲什麽要想這些，想那些事情來麻煩你自己呢？」</p>
<p>作者的描寫是這樣開的，　　－－阿蒲羅摩夫睡在寓所裏始巳經很　了，他還睡在床上；幾次他想爬起來的幾次他巳經把拖鞋穿在他脚上，但是停住想一刻，便又縮回到被窩裏去了。他的老僕手裏端了茶站在床邊，訪問的人來邀他去參加每年一次的五月一日的騎遊，而他却說：「爲什麽？爲什麽我要去尋找這些煩惱，去苦苦的亂跑呢？」</p>
<p>高尙底感覺的快樂，於阿蒲羅摩夫是很接近的，有時，他極憎恨人類的惡習，欺騙，罪惡，疾苦，心血沸騰，激動得從床上坐起來，馬上想把這種激動變成英雄事業，可是當太陽將落時，他就又轉身仰天睡下去，一切者平靜了，悲哀的目送着沉落的太陽。</p>
<p>般家，在何蒲羅摩夫看來，是很恐怖的，很奇異的，他總想拖延下去。他的老僕說：　　「「别人」當必要的時候，也須遷居呢！」</p>
<p>這一「别人」，可氣壤了阿蒲羅摩夫，把老僕責駡了一頓，並且說：</p>
<p>「你可知道「别人」這字的意義？」</p>
<p>「所謂「别人」，就是一個野　的，没有受敎育的人；貧苦而污穢的住在閣樓上，就在一塊地氈上他也可以安睡，吃着番夢和鯡魚過日子，貧苦迫着他東奔西跑－－這樣的人，當然隨時可以到他的新居去。比如那甲埃夫，手下挾着他的用手巾包好的兩件襯衫，就可以跑了。你若問他「到那裏去？他就說「我搬家呀！」「别」人的意義就是這樣的－－你以爲我也是這别人中的一個嗎？」</p>
<p>阿蒲羅摩夫還說了好一些：「「别一個人」，便是自己擦自己的皮鞋，自己穿自己的衣服，····自己買東西，自己燒火，自己掃地，從來不知道使用僕役有什麽意義的人·····」　　「是的，」老僕回答說，「這樣的人正多着呢。」</p>
<p>「對啦，可是我，你看，</p>
<p>我也是其中的一個嗎？」</p>
<p>「不是的，少爺完全不是這樣的····」</p>
<p>「是呀，我的確不是這樣的！我到處亂跑嗎？我工作嗎？我瘦嗎？我有什麽缺少的事情？我從没有遭過凍，遭過餓，我從不知道缺少什麽，－－從没有爲我自己的麵包工作過，也從没有作過污穢的工作·······你好，你爲什麽敢把我和那些「别人」相提並論呢？····」　　老僕流涙了，阿蒲羅摩夫說；</p>
<p>「把窗布入下來，替我蓋上被，不要讓人來打擾我，我要睡一會，回頭呌我用飯吧！」</p>
<p>阿蒲羅摩夫碰着了一位年靑的姑娘奥加，因爲女人常常喜歡作救濟工作的，她便决意要挽救他，可是要戀愛成功，達到結婚的境地，他必要奮發自己，打破生活的賴惰和單調，而這些他實在受不了，竟把阿蒲羅摩夫駭退了，他終於回復到他阿蒲羅摩夫的王國，他的沙發和他的拖鞋裏去了，奥加於是失望的離開他。</p>
<p>這小說自一八五九年出世後，全俄國的人都爭相傳誦着，討論着「阿蒲羅摩夫主義」。每一個人都發覺他自己與阿蒲羅摩夫之間，總有某些相同的病症。而千萬的靑年都愛着奥加，她所喜歡的歌「加斯塔笛華」也變爲他們常唱的曲子。</p>
<p>在現在的蘇聯，特别是在五年計劃的進行中，在工塲，集團農塲，和學校裏，除了列寗動章之外，還盛行着一種「阿蒲羅摩夫勳章」。</p>
<p>爲什麽在現在的蘇聯，還紀念着阿蒲羅摩夫呢？在五年計劃中的工作者，每一個人都相近阿蒲羅摩夫嗎？</p>
<p>那就是笑話了，假設五年計劃的實行者都接近阿蒲羅摩夫的話。絕不是這樣的，只不過是對於少數不努力者的一種處罰，一種侮辱而巳，正好像畫一隻烏龜貼在工作遲緩者的位置上一樣。</p>
<p>阿蒲羅摩夫所代表的是意志堕落以懶惰爲道德的行爲，以及保守性，對於熱情活動的輕視等等的，在農奴制度之下產生的典型人物，然而這種人物一直到現在大世界各處還没有完全死去。但農奴制也並不是這種典型產生的唯一原因，生活富足和資本生產的時代，使這種典型在我們之間永不消滅。</p>
<p>阿蒲羅摩夫是一個普通的典型，一個保守的安逸的典型。當一個人的生活稍爲富裕的時候，就不願有點變動，去開展新的事業，因爲那只會帶許多不快與煩惱給他的。</p>
<p>他避免計劃產業的麻煩，他不知道什麽是義務的工作，什麽是農民的勞苦，麥什麽時候種，什麽候收獲，想到鄉村生活的時候，只想到美麗的花園，森林中的野餐，跟一個美善肥腾的妻子牧歌式的散步；財產怎樣而且爲什麽到他手裏來，許多人爲什麽替他一個人勞苦工作，這些都没有煩擾過他的腦袋。</p>
<p>在智識份子中，在社會上，在個人生活中，卽在現在，也還存在有許多許多的阿蒲羅摩夫。比方在智識界，遇到一新的思想或主張，他們就不安起來，懐疑社會的改革，一件�</p>
<p>提到改變就駭住了他們，戀愛也駭住了他們。</p>
<p>大中國，阿蒲羅摩夫特别多，甚至於一個人具備有阿Ｑ和阿蒲羅摩夫兩種性格。不過這裏有一點不同，阿蒲羅摩夫都是上層的富有階級。新生活運動對於阿蒲羅摩夫們是没有感動的，他們根本就怕「新」，怕「動」，更怕「運動」，要是阿Ｑ轉了念頭，人家打了他的左臉，不拿右臉去就，而拿出拳頭來，那時候，阿蒲羅摩夫們就會消滅了吧。</p>
<p>假如現在作一個詳細的統計，調查全國所有的阿Ｑ和阿蒲羅摩夫，再製一種阿Ｑ勳章和阿蒲羅摩夫勳章，分别給獎，這一種新生活運動，倒也是很别緻不過的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Anniversary of the Founding of the Revolutionary Government: Central Government and National Government Hold Commemorative Meetings Separately; Lin and Wang Report on the Prime Minister's Assumption of Office; Chen Jitang Reviews the Guangdong Army, Navy, and Air Force; Wuhan Vigorously Implements the New Life Movement <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a grand meeting this morning to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the founding of the Revolutionary Government. The Party headquarters and its surroundings were decorated with flowers, colorful ribbons, cypress branches, and slogans, creating a new atmosphere. Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Wang Zhaoming, Liu Shouzhong, Deng Jiayan, Zhang Zhen, Chen Bijun, Zeng Zhongming, Duan Xipeng, Gu Zhenggang, Miao Peicheng, representatives from various organizations, and all working comrades, totaling over 600 people, attended. The meeting began at 9:00 AM with Qin Le as the host and Wang Zhaoming as the chairman, who also gave an impromptu report. He stated that the Prime Minister devoted himself to the revolution for 40 years. Before the Xinhai Revolution, the target of the revolution was the Manchu imperial system. From after the Xinhai Revolution until before the fifth year of the Republic, the goal was to overthrow Yuan Shikai. After the sixth year of the Republic, the objective was to eliminate the Northern Warlords. Although the imperial system had been overthrown, only the name of the Chinese nation was obtained. Without eliminating the warlords, it would be difficult to establish a Revolutionary Government based on the Three Principles of the People. In order to implement the revolutionary cause, the Prime Minister did not shy away from difficulties and took on the position of Grand Marshal in Guangdong in the fifth year of the Republic, and again on this day in the tenth year of the Republic, he returned to Guangdong to assume the position of Extraordinary Grand President, raising the banner of revolution and fighting against the warlords and counter-revolutionaries. This led to the events of the eleventh year of the Republic, where the Prime Minister faced danger and almost sacrificed himself. Despite this peril, his determination did not waver. The Prime Minister's thorough commitment to the revolution, his lack of perfunctoriness, his avoidance of difficulties, and his uncompromising spirit towards enemies should be admired and emulated by all compatriots. The hardships the Prime Minister endured at that time, and the price he paid, brought glory to the revolution, which shines upon the world. This spiritual light is left to us today to guide us to advance boldly on this bright path. This is the greatest significance of our commemoration of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government today, and we should never forget it for a moment. Currently, the national crisis is serious. The government is under pressure from external forces and faces criticism from within the country. How to overcome this crisis and enable the country to find a path to survival is something no one can confidently guarantee. However, we, as Party comrades, should learn from the Prime Minister's uncompromising spirit towards the revolution, unite sincerely with a thorough commitment, and advance courageously along the bright path the Prime Minister pointed out. No matter what, the country will surely turn from danger to safety, and the opportunity for revival depends on this. The speech concluded at 10:00 AM, and the meeting adjourned with music.

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a grand meeting this morning to commemorate the founding of the Revolutionary Government. He Yaozu, Chen Shaokuan, Cao Haosen, Niu Yongjian, Li Yuanding, Zhu Jiaj骅, Chen Qicai, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and civil and military officials from various ministries and departments, totaling over 300 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the attendees in paying respects, he delivered a report, stating that today is the 13th anniversary of the Prime Minister's assumption of the position of Extraordinary Grand President in Guangzhou. The Prime Minister, recognizing the perilous state of the country at the time and the inability of the corner of Guangzhou to achieve peace, resolutely assumed the extraordinary presidential position elected by the National Assembly, taking on the heavy responsibility of saving the Party and the country and fighting against all counter-revolutionary forces. Recalling the unification of the North and South in the first year of the Republic and the proclamation of the Republic, the Prime Minister relinquished the presidential position to Yuan Shikai, demonstrating that the Prime Minister was not concerned with power but was entirely devoted to fulfilling his responsibilities to the Party and the country. The greatness of the Prime Minister's spirit lies in this. After the Prime Minister stepped down, he had grand plans to build railways and develop mineral resources throughout the country. Unfortunately, many people at the time did not understand, and even doubted, leading to the failure of the Prime Minister's plans. Later, Yuan betrayed the Republic, overturned peace, and attempted to restore the imperial system, inviting foreign aggression. These were all the reasons that led to today's national crisis. Today, as we commemorate during this time of national crisis, we should uphold the Prime Minister's fearless spirit, strive to realize the Prime Minister's entire legacy, and make up for the negligence of the past. The meeting adjourned with music at 10:30 AM. (Central News Agency Dispatch, Fifth)</p>

<h3 id="e30">The Future of the Saar Question <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>According to a Berlin dispatch on the 2nd, the German government has issued a notice to the people of the Saar, ordering them to prepare for the "plebiscite" next year in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, in order to determine the ownership of this region. If we are not forgetful, we should remember that Hitler once directly negotiated with France, demanding the immediate return of the Saar, and declaring that if France agreed to his request, Germany would have no further demands. Hitler always vowed to restore lost territories, yet his territorial demands on France were so small, which was beyond the expectations of the world. However, Hitler's request was still rejected by France. Now, judging from Hitler's notice, he has abandoned his original claim and yielded to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. The National Socialist Party's attitude has become so docile, not only inconsistent with its usual rhetoric, but also far inferior to that of other political parties. Although the foreign policy stances of other political parties are not very strong, they can still achieve the goal of reducing reparations and make considerable revisions to the Treaty of Versailles. Since coming to power, Hitler has been harsh and arrogant, regarding the world as nothing, thinking that diplomacy can also be achieved through threats, just like seizing domestic power. As a result, he has alienated various countries and become isolated and helpless. Although his attitude has gradually become silent and softened, he still cannot gain people's trust and sympathy. Whether the Saar region can be returned to Germany in the future is greatly related to Hitler's policies. Let me venture to offer my humble opinion.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, after the Saar region has been governed by the Governing Commission organized by the League of Nations for fifteen years, the local people can hold a vote to decide on three issues: (1) Maintaining the status quo, that is, continuing to be governed by the League of Nations. (2) Merging with France. (3) Returning to Germany. When these three issues are put to a vote next year, the truth will naturally come out and a final solution will be obtained. However, judging from the various current situations, there are great problems as to whether this region can be returned to Germany. If Germany did not have a person like Hitler, I dare to predict that the return of the Saar to Germany next year would not be much of a problem. But in today's Hitler's dictatorship, it is very unpredictable. The difficulties that can be pointed out are: First, France's attitude. Since the Nazi Party has been carrying out large-scale activities in the Saar region, France has used its influence in the Saar Governing Commission to actively suppress them. At the same time, it advocates preventing the Nazi Party from manipulating the voting movement of Saar residents next year. According to a Geneva dispatch on the 2nd of this month, this issue has been included in the agenda of the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting that will open in the middle of this month. It can be seen that France has already prepared to manipulate the voting movement in the Saar next year. This is one of the difficulties for the Saar to return to Germany.</p>
<p>Second, although the 800,000 residents of the Saar are all Germans, most of them are Catholics. The power of the German Centre Party accounts for half of the entire population and can be said to be the only major party in the Saar region. However, this political party represents the Catholic Church, and its nature is the same as that of the Christian Social Party led by Dollfuss in Austria (now merged with the Austrian Home Guard and has become a fascist political party). It was this Christian Social Party, which represents Catholics, that opposed Hitler's movement to merge Germany and Austria in Austria. The reason why Catholics rejected the Nazi Party was that they did not want to be controlled by the Nazi Party. If the Nazi Party gains power, not only will other political parties have no room for existence, but even the Catholic Church will be controlled by it. This fact has already been performed in Germany and it is difficult to guarantee that it will not affect other German regions. The Germans in Austria know this, so they would rather cooperate with the Latin-speaking Italy than merge with the German-speaking Germany. Now, using the example of Austria to speculate on the Saar, even if it is not exactly the same, it is not far off. On the one hand, the Catholics in Germany still have disputes with the Nazi Party. On the other hand, the Centre Party, which represents German Catholics, has been eliminated by the Nazi Party since Hitler came to power. It is not as good as the Saar Centre Party under the rule of the League of Nations, which can still operate freely. From this point of view, the Catholics and the Centre Party in the Saar, learning from the past, will inevitably be wary and do not want the Saar to return to Germany. This is the second difficulty.</p>
<p>Third, the workers in the Saar mining area are mostly guided by the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party. These political parties have been wiped out by the Nazi Party in Germany. Their resentment towards the Nazi Party must be far greater than before Hitler came to power. Recently, it has been heard that France has tried to accommodate these political parties, ordering their party newspapers to step up their propaganda against the return of the Saar to Germany. This is the third difficulty for the Saar to return to Germany. Moreover, since Hitler came to power, many people who are not tolerated in Germany have gathered in the Saar. These exiles will inevitably oppose Hitler's success. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>Based on these points, even if a vote is held in the Saar region next year, it may be difficult to return to Germany. The result may be to maintain the status quo and continue to be governed by the League of Nations. If so, Germany's diplomacy will suffer another failure.</p>

<p>(Washington) After the US fleet departs from the Panama Canal</p>
<p>Zone tomorrow, it will conduct combat exercises against a hypothetical enemy, who is believed to have challenged the US naval hegemony in the Caribbean Sea. Fleet No. 15 of the Question Mark will demonstrate how to defend the Panama Canal and the US East Coast after a battle fleet suffers a defeat at the start of a war. This will give the peaceful US Marine Corps a taste of hardship. According to the simulated combat program, the hypothetical enemy fleet will occupy the US naval base in the West Indies and concentrate strong naval forces on the sea there, creating a wartime situation. Representing the United States is a battle fleet, commanded by Admiral Reeves. The hypothetical enemy is represented by a reconnaissance fleet,</p>
<p>led by Vice Admiral Blumbe. The commander-in-chief of the US fleet</p>
<p>is Admiral Sello, who will supervise the battle from the flagship Pennsylvania. Both sides are equipped with equal air forces and one aircraft carrier each. The Marine Corps is concentrated in the Canal Zone, serving as the attacking force, landing under the cover of the fleet's heavy artillery, and occupying the forward base. Marine Corps Commander Lehman is the former commander of the US Marine Corps in Shanghai. All ships will turn off their lights at night, guarding against enemy attacks. Officers and soldiers will practice at the combat location from time to time, and will open fire and bombard as soon as they encounter the hypothetical enemy. The only difference from a real war is that live ammunition will not be used. According to the US Navy's previous exercise, it was conducted in February 1933 by Fleet No. 14 of the Question Mark between the Hawaiian Islands and the Pacific coast. According to the official report, various fleets and aircraft carriers have made significant progress in that exercise. Secretary of the Navy Swanson declared in his last annual report: "The annual concentration and occasional tactical exercises of the fleet have great effects on the training of naval personnel and will continue to be held."

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a memorandum regarding the unofficial statement made by the United States on April 30 regarding Japan's policy towards China. As a result of deliberations on how Japan should deal with this, it was generally agreed that although there is no need to issue a statement against the United States at the moment, failing to express any intention would lead the United States to misunderstand that the Japanese government acquiesces in the US memorandum and fully acknowledges the US point of view. Therefore, in order to eliminate future misunderstandings, it is necessary to clearly express Japan's beliefs at an appropriate opportunity through statements and other methods. This view is generally consistent. (Dentsu dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) State Department officials today expressed satisfaction with the current trend of the Far Eastern situation. The attitude taken by French Foreign Minister Barthou in replying to the Japanese note was particularly pleasing to the State Department. Officials here believe that France's note upholding the Nine-Power Treaty is a full endorsement of Secretary of State Hull's firm opposition to Japan's Asian Monroe Doctrine. An Associated Press reporter also learned that State Department officials were also very satisfied with the warning issued by British Minister of Commerce Runciman to Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira in London yesterday. It is said that if the United States has a way, it will also take the same action as England to deal with the cheap sale of Japanese goods. State Department officials said that the British-Japanese trade war does not affect American commerce. Regarding the difficult situation of British-Japanese cotton industry competition, the Federal Tariff Commission announced that the President has approved the implementation of a tax increase on Japanese-branded canned food from May 31, which has attracted attention from all parties.

At the same time, the ad valorem tax on Canadian-branded canned food will be reduced from 35% to 23%. (National Telegram on the 4th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Hu Shih-tse, the Chinese Minister to Switzerland, spoke to an Associated Press reporter today, pointing out that Japan's attempt to create hegemony in the Far East has failed, and it is likely to vent its anger on Rajchman, the liaison officer between the League of Nations and China. Minister Hu declared, "Japan's declaration has aroused public outrage around the world. The Japanese are eager to save this matter, so they do not hesitate to turn Rajchman into their target of attack. The Japanese have no right to arbitrarily approve or disapprove of the League of Nations' assistance to China's construction. There are many reasons for this. The Japanese have withdrawn from the League of Nations and have no intention of returning, which is one. The tenth provision of the League of Nations General Assembly's report on the Sino-Japanese incident on February 24, 1933, suggested cooperation between China and the League of Nations, which is the second. The Japanese opposed this report at that time, which is the third reason. Because the Japanese do not trust this plan, it is absurd for the Japanese to oppose this major issue if it is unfavorable to them." (National Telegram on the 4th)</p>

During this conversation, the Secretary-General took the opportunity to inform the Japanese Consul-General of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations' resolution on technical cooperation with China and the specific content under the implementation of this resolution, in order to eliminate possible misunderstandings. He did not say that any changes are being made. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<p>Japanese Ambassador to France Sato formally visited Foreign Minister Barthou yesterday to explain the declaration made by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman on April 17. The Times published an editorial today, stating that the Japanese government automatically explained its views without waiting for the formal inquiry of the French government. This courteous act is enough to eliminate all misunderstandings in principle and in fact. From the statement of the Japanese ambassador, it can be seen that the views officially stated by the Tokyo government are more of a retreat than the views stated in a semi-official form by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman on April 17, and the threat of all disputes seems to have been avoided at present. Because Japan is currently facing various difficulties in its internal affairs, and various opposing trends are confronting each other, it is not allowed to make a decisive gamble. The French reply also resolutely stated that if Japan believes that a certain interference is sufficient to hinder the order and justice in the Far East, then whether in law or in fact, Japan can only consult the opinions of the signatory countries in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. As for other methods, they are not recognized by France. (Havas dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<p>Several newspapers this morning commented on the Far Eastern issue. The organ of the Progressive Party, "Business News," said that the League of Nations Committee on Technical Cooperation with China will hold a meeting on the 15th of this month, the purpose of which is to assist China in construction. The Japanese government is well aware of this and expressed its views a few days ago in an attempt to prevent European countries from assisting China. Japan's intention may be to provoke the whole world before directly negotiating with China. As for US President Roosevelt's recent overtures to Japan, Japan actually made the statement on April 17, which is nothing short of an insult to the United States and is unusually embarrassing. However, we believe that Japan has no worries in Asia for the time being. Within eighteen months, Japan will definitely attack Soviet Russia. If this happens, the whole world will feel the danger. This complex and serious situation will cause a reaction in Geneva. At that time, Japan will treat the rights of the powers in China in a generous manner in order to ease the hearts of the powers.</p>

We cannot predict. The only thing that can curb this impact is the inferior position of the British and American navies in the Western Pacific, so that it does not fully develop.

<h3 id="e49">Preparing to Implement a Trade War Against Japan: Banning the Import of Cotton Goods and Artificial Silk; Japan to Request Britain to Postpone Implementation <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A Reuters correspondent today visited the spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry to inquire whether the memorandum issued by British Trade Secretary Runciman was in the nature of an ultimatum. The spokesperson replied that the memorandum had just been completely translated and needed further study before any comments could be made. The drafting of a reply would also take several days, as it was necessary to consult with business leaders. At the same time, various newspapers expressed the opinion that the quota system would not seriously affect Japanese trade in the British territories, as Japanese goods sales had continued to increase despite repeated tax increases in the various British territories. It was also doubtful whether the quota system would affect Japanese trade with the British Dominions, as Japan's exports were currently continuing to increase. In April of this year, the increase amounted to 33 million Japanese yen compared to April of last year. The world orders received by Osaka have already extended to August of this year. Therefore, it seems difficult to agree with Britain's opinion. According to the prediction of a certain Japanese newspaper, the Japanese government will adopt a tough attitude, even if trade negotiations break down as a result. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira sent a telegram to the Foreign Ministry on the 5th, reporting the contents of the memorandum delivered by British Trade Secretary Runciman. According to the telegram, the British government limited the types of goods to be discussed in the Anglo-Japanese talks to cotton cloth and artificial silk, and the agreed-upon region was mainland Britain and its directly administered colonies. The measure to be taken this time was an import allocation system, applied to cotton cloth and artificial silk. For Japanese silk, it was planned to increase tariffs. If Japan did not express a compromising attitude in the Anglo-Japanese talks, it was planned to start an Anglo-Japanese economic war. After receiving this telegram, the Japanese Foreign Ministry studied countermeasures. Because confrontation with Britain would be unfavorable to Japan, it was planned to avoid an economic war and request Britain to postpone the implementation of the allocation system, or to present a Japanese proposal to Britain. (Japan United Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received by the Foreign Ministry on the 4th from Ambassador Matsudaira in Britain, British Trade Secretary Runciman met with Ambassador Matsudaira on the 3rd and personally handed over a memorandum regarding Anglo-Japanese trade. He also told Matsudaira that the contents of the memorandum would be announced in the British Parliament on the 7th. Matsudaira immediately asked the Trade Secretary whether it was true that the British government planned to implement an import allocation system for Japanese goods, as reported in the newspapers. The Trade Secretary replied that the import allocation system was still under consideration and had not yet been decided. Furthermore, the Japanese goods to which the system would be applied were limited to special commercial goods such as cotton cloth and artificial silk, and would not be applied to general merchandise. According to the Trade Secretary's reply, the British government seemed to intend to implement an import allocation system for Japanese goods, and the Japanese government attached great importance to its future. (Japan United Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department and the Commerce Department are currently studying the extent to which the low prices of Japanese goods in the Philippines, Hawaii, Panama, Puerto Rico, and Alaska are damaging American goods. Officials from both departments believe that Britain and its colonies have agreed to boycott Japanese goods, but it is difficult for the United States to follow suit. The fall in prices of Japanese goods has led to an increasing demand for them in various American territories, but the rate of increase is not of a serious nature compared to the total amount of Japanese trade. For example, in 1931, Japanese goods imported into the United States were valued at 425,330,000 Japanese yen, and in 1933 this had only increased to 492,113,700 yen. Furthermore, in 1911, the Philippine Islands purchased Japanese goods worth a total of 20,425,000 yen, and in 1933 this had only increased to 24,050,000 yen. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(London) According to an official announcement made today, a new tax will be implemented from May 8th, which will affect the Chinese egg industry importing to Britain. Currently, shelled eggs are taxed ad valorem, but in the future, they will be taxed by weight. Liquid or solidified eggs, including those prepared with glycerin, will be taxed at half a penny per pound. Whole dried eggs will be taxed at two pence and twenty-five hundredths per pound, dried egg yolk at one penny and twenty-five hundredths per pound, and dried egg white at two pence and seventy-five hundredths per pound. Furthermore, unground pepper will be taxed at five shillings and six pence per 112 pounds, also effective from May 8th. This new tax is approximately equivalent to 10% of the current average import value of the items listed. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e53">Plan to Raise Prices: Not Focusing on Currency Devaluation <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) According to information obtained from responsible sources, the authorities are currently implementing a plan to raise prices. The plan intends to start with stimulating commercial activities through indirect methods, and does not focus on experimental methods of currency devaluation. It is now believed that President Roosevelt still hopes that prices can be raised to be equal to those in 1926, but progress is slower than expected. Administrative leaders are still engaged in the price increase movement, and have not expressed impatience due to the slow progress. For example, officials of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration did not express excessive alarm over the recent decline in wheat prices. The authorities are urgently trying to raise prices in order to reduce the national debt and to allow real estate to circulate. For example, the $200 million Exchange Stabilization Fund will be used to devalue the currencies of non-gold standard countries in order to promote the sales of American goods in those countries. This step will also promote the increase of domestic prices. (National News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Interior Secretary Ickes told the Associated Press today that big business has already forgotten the lessons of the depression. The Public Works Administration plans to allocate another 500 million US dollars as construction reserves.

Therefore, the reconstruction funds have reached 4 billion US dollars. The previously allocated 3.3 billion was distributed completely in six months. This is the largest expenditure in peacetime, and has not been seen in any country or any place. The 500 million dollars now allocated is a part of President Roosevelt's 2.2 billion dollar budget, which has been designated by President Roosevelt for the next fiscal year. Roosevelt's allocation procedures are as follows: 600 million for relief, 500 million for public works, and 100 million for the Agricultural Credit Administration and domestic public debt.

<p>(New York) A bank in Fort Recovery, Ohio, was robbed by two armed bandits today, and five people were injured. It is generally believed that the notorious bandit Dillinger must be one of the two bandits. The two bandits were neatly dressed, looking like ordinary customers. They entered the bank without arousing suspicion that they were carrying weapons. However, after entering, they immediately brandished their submachine guns. The employees of the bank could not resist, and cash and securities worth 18,000 dollars were stolen. When leaving, the bandits forced one male and one female employee to walk in front of them as shields. At this time, the bank employee had already sent out a warning signal. The bandits knew that the situation was urgent, so they quickly took the loot into a car parked on the side of the road, and made the two employees stand on either side of the car's fenders. They drove off quickly. The bank employees chased them to the outside of the bank, firing shots remotely. However, it was too late. The police heard the alarm but did not chase them either, but they were all afraid of accidentally injuring the innocent employees next to the car, so they did not dare to shoot freely. When the chasers and the two bandits exchanged gunfire, five of the chasers were injured. The bandits finally escaped. After the car had gone a long distance, the bandits ordered the two employees to get out of the car. After this case occurred, 10,000 central soldiers and police immediately engaged in a large-scale search in Ohio and Indiana, hoping to capture the fugitives. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

Later, Mr. Todd, chairman of the Liberal Youth League, gave a speech, enthusiastically supporting parliamentary freedom and opposing right-leaning Pan-Germanism or the Labor Party's Pan-Germanism.

However, he was unwilling to support the destruction of private enterprises and individual entrepreneurship, as well as the transfer of industry and commerce and finance to political management, and he was also unwilling to condone the abuse of public funds. The Liberal Party's work is to re-create a united party with capacity that can abandon all individual issues.

<p>(London) According to the latest news from Cairo, after the Hejaz army advanced victoriously, a large number of Yemenese troops have mutinied. Hodeidah has reportedly been occupied, and 10,000 residents have requested protection from two British cruisers anchored in the port. The Hejaz Foreign Minister has notified various countries that he will be responsible for protecting foreign nationals in the occupied areas, and the Hejaz government will be responsible for maintaining the administration of the occupied areas. It is reported that the King of Yemen has decided to rely on the dangerous terrain to firmly defend the capital city of Sana'a, and the attacking troops have slowed their offensive due to the difficulty of marching through the mountains between Hodeidah and Sana'a. It is said that the Yemenese army can gain an advantage in mountain warfare, so the two Arab countries have reached the final decisive stage. The Hejaz ambassador to Britain told the Daily Telegraph that Hejaz's annexation of Yemen would not be affected by Aden. (National News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

According to another source, the Yemenese army has mutinied en masse, especially in Najran and Hodeidah. The Yemenese army in these two places is no longer able to resist. Another report said that a revolution had occurred in the Yemenese capital and was spreading to various cities. According to rumors, Ibn Saud's army is now occupying Hodeidah.

This would mean that Hejaz's actions could impact countries that border the Arabian Peninsula, such as: Iraq, Palestine (mandated to Britain by the League of Nations), Transjordan (mandated to Britain), and Syria (mandated to France) In short, this could set off various disputes with European countries that have interests in the Arabian Peninsula, i.e. England, France, and Italy. The Roman daily "Il Popolo di Roma" writes that the Hejaz King, Ibn Saud, holds great ambition to control the Arabian Peninsula, but its realization would present a grave situation in Europe given the interests of England, France, and Italy.

Additionally, the "Gold Discount Bank" has 60 million marks worth of promissory notes that can be collected.

<h3 id="e86">Japan's New Diplomatic Strategy (Japan Communication) Arita First Returns Home Hirota's Statement Intended <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota's so-called "moral diplomacy" and a new diplomatic lineup have, in practice, achieved considerable success in diplomacy towards the United States. Now, he intends to gradually summon ambassadors and ministers stationed abroad back to Japan to discuss new strategies. The first to be summoned back is Ambassador to China, Ariyoshi Akira. From the steps and timing of his return, one can glean the importance of Ariyoshi's return. According to Hirota's intentions, Japan's diplomacy towards China is planning to take advantage of this opportunity to shift away from its previous fierce image and adopt a relatively moderate approach.</p>
<p>Attempted Economic Alliance</p>
<p>Focus on Dealing with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>However, the military still strongly advocates a hardline stance, believing that Japan should at least obtain a so-called special position in China, and that this special position must be recognized by all countries in the world, requiring at least the understanding of Britain and the United States. Therefore, Director of the Foreign Ministry's Intelligence Department, Amau Eiji, turned Foreign Minister Hirota's words into an informal conversation and used it as a form of propaganda material to publicize to the world. While stating Japan's position, it also sought the understanding of the military. Unexpectedly, this aroused reactions from world opinion and prompted serious attention from Britain and the United States. As a result, Hirota ordered ambassadors and ministers stationed abroad to explain everywhere, especially to Britain and the United States, providing more detailed explanations, clarifying that Japan does not intend to close off the East's door, meaning that even the door of Manchuria could be opened, as a strategy.</p>
<p>The important event of Ariyoshi's return home is to report the true situation in China. However, one particularly important aspect is to promote the so-called Sino-Japanese economic alliance. Because of this matter, among the general economic circles in China, there are naturally few supporters and many opponents, making it difficult to achieve appropriate and satisfactory results. On the international front, everyone wants to obtain preferential benefits and is unwilling to let Japan monopolize them, especially in the Pacific region, where the stakes are high. Japan must carefully handle it. Ariyoshi's mission in returning home is to discuss these kinds of countermeasures, to see what kind of tactics to use so as not to provoke the resentment of the great powers, to allow the United States and Britain to adopt a bystander's attitude, and at the same time, how to restrain China from silently obeying its arrangements. The specific details are not yet very clear, but the general principles have been decided.</p>
<p>Japan's preparation for war against the Soviet Union has almost become an open secret. However, when and how this war will be launched is still unknown. Currently, or in the near future, Japan does not yet have the determination to attack the Soviet Union. The biggest reason is that international relations have not been handled well. Various projects in the Northeast have just begun, and Japan's own military preparations have not been completed, especially the expansion of the air force and tank corps, which are not yet fully equipped. The economic situation in its own country, apart from the military industry, is still struggling in a recession. Therefore, it is unwilling to immediately challenge. Therefore, its first priority is to complete its so-called "Japan-Manchuria Economic Alliance," which goes without saying that it is to bring all the economic power of the four northeastern provinces under the control of Japan, and under the sole management of the military. Even the Mitsui and Mitsubishi Zaibatsu must listen to the military's command. According to the military's view, the so-called "Japan-Manchuria Economic Alliance" is primarily for national defense. This national defense, needless to say, refers to the projects in the Greater Khingan Range area, as well as the military installations in the Muling area, and the new planned seven major railway lines within the borders of the four northeastern provinces, as well as the steel industry, nitrogen industry, etc. The military construction in the Greater Khingan Range has already been implemented step by step, to be completed no later than the summer of next year. Several important railways, especially the Jehol railway, will be completed this year.</p>
<p>What the Japanese militarists lack confidence in now is still international diplomatic relations. It still has vigilance towards China, wanting to have a reliable solution as soon as possible. It is even more anxious about Britain and the United States. If serious problems arise between Japan and the Soviet Union, and if Britain and the United States maintain a strict neutral attitude and do not provide Japan with material assistance, its steel raw materials and petroleum and other important resources will have no source, and the result will inevitably be to fall into a tragic situation. Therefore, Hirota's diplomacy, on the one hand, seeks understanding from Britain and the United States, finding factors of reconciliation, and on the other hand, wants to monopolize the Far East market without revealing traces. This is to discuss with Ariyoshi how to play this set of tricks. (April 30th, Tokyo)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Jidong</p>
<h3 id="e87">Military Telephones Extensively Installed Already Erected in More Than Two Counties Military Exercises Daily <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Communication: The Japanese troops stationed in North China have been very active recently. The troops stationed east of Tangshan and at various passes along the Great Wall conduct combat exercises every few days. The Asami Battalion of the Tangshan Japanese Army has conducted field exercises at the local Western Hills shooting range five times in the past month alone. Sometimes they notify our side before the exercises, and sometimes they conduct live-fire exercises late at night. Residents are awakened in their sleep, fleeing in panic. By the time the truth is understood, the Japanese army's exercises have already ended. Afterwards, the Japanese army informs our local authorities by telephone, explaining the course of the exercises, but by then the incident has already passed, the people's panic has subsided, and notification and explanation are too late. Similar incidents occur wherever Japanese troops are stationed in Jidong, causing deep disturbance. The Japanese troops stationed at various passes along the Great Wall form teams, enter various counties by car to survey the terrain, and photograph strategic locations, in countless instances. It is not known what the Japanese army's intentions are with such busyness. The Japanese troops stationed in various places have freely erected military telephone lines in ten locations, including Xinglong, Malan峪, Gubeikou, Tangshan, Zunhua, Linyu, Qian'an, Fengrun, Funing, and Luanxian. Their telephone lines are all hung on our long-distance telephone poles. The long-distance telephone bureau has telegraphed the provincial government in detail, requesting that the matter be included in the case for negotiations. The province has instructed Tao Shangming and Yin Rugeng to negotiate with the Japanese to remove the lines, but it is not certain whether this will be effective. The Japanese troops stationed in Beijing and Tangshan conducted a long-distance military vehicle exercise again on the 30th of last month. A heavy truck departed from Beiping, driven by 25 Japanese soldiers, passed through the Ping-Sui Line, and drove to Nankou, planning to camp overnight in Nankou. On April 2nd, it returned to Beiping along the original route. Three military vehicles departed from Tangshan, driven by a Japanese squad, and drove along the Beining Line to Tianjin. They departed on April 30th, camped in Hanzhuang on the first day, arrived in Tianjin at noon on the second day, went to Yixingbu south of Tianjin on the third day, and returned to Tangshan in the afternoon. In addition, on April 29th, two squads of Japanese troops, about 70 soldiers, arrived in Ninghe County from Bin Di County. After arriving in the county, they divided into two teams, one team went to the suburbs to survey, and the other team erected telephone lines and tried to communicate with Japanese troops in various places. On the morning of the 30th, they conducted street fighting exercises in the streets, disturbing the entire county's merchants, who closed their doors and stopped business, daring not go out. In the evening, the Japanese troops began to head towards Fengrun, and the area returned to peace. The Japanese troops stationed in Malanyu conducted field artillery exercises near the Qing Tombs on the morning of April 1st, firing dozens of cannons. Nearby residents all thought a major war was coming and fled in panic. By noon, the Japanese army's exercises stopped, and the people realized the truth and gradually returned to their original residences. These are all recent shows of force by the Japanese army, and we have no way to protest to stop them. (May 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Northwest Inspection Notes Special Correspondent Geng Ya's Miscellaneous News from Baotou <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li Yunyu, editor of the Baotou Daily, sends a copy of the newspaper to me daily, which I appreciate. To report on the local conditions and customs, I was guided to visit the only scenic spot in Baotou, the "Zhuanlongzang." Stepping out of the eastern suburbs, a slope faces you, with a low-lying middle section. The majestic temple corners tower high among the forests. This is the Zhuanlongzang. Climbing the slope northward, one sees the ruins of a radio station, which was built and then destroyed by Feng Yuxiang. Passing a stage on flat ground, one enters the "Longquan Temple" gate. In the courtyard, a spring gushes from the ground, its force almost enough to turn a millstone. The taste is sweet and the color is clear, and it is the drinking water for the entire city. Ascending the steps to the "Little South Sea" gate, a notice is posted: "Women are not allowed to enter the temple without reason." I once visited Yungang in Datong. When female students from a Beiping student tour group occasionally climbed on a stone Buddha, the village women who saw it from afar exclaimed, "That is a woman, how dare she defile the Buddha!" It is evident that the custom of "disparaging women" is still prevalent outside the Great Wall. In the main hall, three Buddha statues are sculpted. Beside the hall stands a stone tablet for famine relief, briefly stating that in the fifteenth year of Baotou, large armies passed through the area, and the local savings were exhausted. In the sixteenth and seventeenth years, a severe drought occurred, spreading throughout the Sui area, coupled with Fu Bu Jing's unrest, causing the people to be displaced. Wang Tingying provided famine relief for three months, spending over four thousand yuan in silver, etc. The abbot is a "Western monk," who is said to have a good understanding of Buddhist scriptures. I briefly talked with him and then left. Leaving the mountain gate, gazing at the scenery of the entire Zang, it all comes into view, as elegant as a natural painting, and the Yellow River fish boats ripple, clearly visible. The refreshing atmosphere is beyond comparison.</p>
<p>According to legend, Baotou was a sandy wasteland in the Qing Dynasty, sparsely populated. Five or ten families gathered into a village, and most of the residents were Mongolian, living purely by nomadic life. Trading was rare, only a few people, all using Naobao as a market, where Mongolians and Han Chinese traded, starting from there. At that time, deer from the Daqingshan Mountains often came to "Zhuanlongzang" to drink spring water. The Mongolians admired them, and the scenery touched their feelings, gradually calling the area in the eastern suburbs "Baogutu." Baogutu is the root of the naming of Baotou. At that time, a Tibetan Grand Lama came to Baotou, hung his staff at Zhuanlongzang, and his medical and fortune-telling skills became famous for a time. When Emperor Kangxi conquered Galdan and returned through Naobao, he expressed admiration and built the Guangjue Temple on Wudang Mountain for him to reside in. At the same time, residents, drinking the water and thinking of the source, also built Guangde Temple for the Lama at Zhuanzang. The number of merchants increased daily, gradually evolving, and Baotou was first opened.</p>
<p>Fuzheng Temple is located in the northeast corner of the city, purely a Mongolian Lama temple. The temple door is tightly closed, with the key hidden in the threshold. Opening the door and entering, the hall is short and deep. On the central table are small photos of the Panchen Lama and scriptures, with more than ten copper bowls of water and many kneeling pads placed beside them. Behind the table at an oblique angle, each has scripture shelves, wrapped in yellow silk, seemingly very precious. Buddha statues are sculpted against the walls, all hideous and terrifying, covered with yellow silk, making it difficult to see the details in the dim room. The guiding lamas all bowed to the table, making a sound by touching the table, and turning to look at us, repeatedly saying "Morocco," meaning that we should perform the ritual like them. Leaving the hall, I invited the lamas to take photos together. At first, they firmly declined, but later, seeing the camera being fully unfolded and the copper frame extended, they</p>
<p>each ran to their Zen rooms, re-arranged their clothes and came out. A certain Grand Lama of Wudang Zhao, who was here to welcome the Xuanhua envoy Zhangjia, also spoke Chinese and volunteered to join the photography. Could it be that interacting with the Mongols is like governing the people, "it is difficult to plan the beginning, but easy to enjoy the success"?</p>
<p>Lamaism is originally a type of Buddhism. During the Zhenguan period of the Tang Dynasty, Buddhism was introduced to Tibet and was mixed with gods, ghosts, and heresies. Therefore, the statues in the temples are mostly gods and monsters. Moreover, in order to adapt to the environment, lamas still eat beef and mutton as usual. This is also completely different from Buddhism. The Mongols are superstitious in Lamaism. For lamas, their glory is almost like the imperial examinations in the Qing Dynasty. At least one son must become a lama, otherwise the Living Buddha will send down illness and disaster. Therefore, the birth rate is declining daily. When a son becomes a lama, it is like entering school, and sometimes the family even relies on supplying expenses. Those tens of thousands of lamas do not engage in production, but live by alms and obtain the people's offerings through political and religious means. The American Andrews said, "The demise of the Mongolian nation is entirely due to Lamaism. If Lamaism can be abolished and the Mongols can receive proper education from the government, there is still hope for Mongolia." This statement is quite reasonable. The people of Sui have proposed popularizing education in Mongolia to replace Lamaism. Mongolians such as "Man Tai, the Chief of the Tumet General Administration" and "Rong Xiang, the Secretary-General of the Mongolian Border Command," are said to be scholars with deep learning, and other Mongolian youths who have received school education, why not work hard for this?</p>
<p>The Mongols use brick tea as currency. In addition to directly bartering furs for rice and cloth, the value of everything else is determined by brick tea. This custom has continued to this day and has not been completely changed. There are "39," "27," and "24" teas. The so-called "24" tea is the brick tea that can be placed in 24 pieces per box. Each "24" box is worth about 33 yuan, each piece weighs five and a half catties, worth one yuan and two or three cents. The red-colored leaves, containing twigs, and the "24" tea that has been soaked for a long time are the most preferred by ordinary Mongols. Holding it to exchange for furs and other items, it can be used as a two-yuan currency. The 39 tea is worth about six cents and can also be used as a one-yuan circulating currency. In addition, there is also Qianliang tea, which seems to be molded from willow trees, so the shape is very similar to willow trunks. When sold, it is sawn horizontally like a cutting board and sells well in Ningxia, Gansu, and other places.</p>
<p>Among the schools in Baotou, there is the Suiyuan Provincial Second Middle School (only offering junior high school), with four classes of co-educational students, about five hundred and sixty students. There are five county-run primary schools, but there are no schools in the villages. Teachers are lacking, mostly hired from outside. Classical scripture private schools are more numerous than schools. Slips of paper saying "So-and-so School will open on the sixteenth day of the first month" are everywhere, but those willing to send their children to school (whether new or old)</p>
<p>are few in number. School-age children do not know how to read and mostly take mud on the streets and alleys, knead it into bowl shapes, throw it on the ground to make a bang, startling passersby, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>The houses here are all single-story. Entering the door, one sees a screen wall, and a small temple is made in the cave wall to worship the local god. Entering another door, four rooms form a courtyard, and the courtyard is very wide. The roofs are mostly flat earthen platforms, easy to go up and down, and can be used for drying things. I once saw a courtyard where mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were quarreling. The neighbors heard it and climbed on the roofs to look down. They were all small-footed women. Hearing loud voices on the road also often comes from high places.</p>
<p>The shop signs in the city mostly use both Han and Mongolian characters. Those setting up stalls on the ground must either sell chivalrous Four Books or smoking utensils. Paper lanterns with "Opening a Lamp Smoking House" and "Buying Harmful Ash" are especially scattered everywhere, actually many times more than restaurants. In the open space in the southwest corner of the city, poppies have been sown. Every summer, when the red and white flowers bloom, tourists flock there. No wonder nearly half of the more than 20,000 residents of the city are opium addicts.</p>
<p>People gather in the streets to gamble at Xiangqi, with large wins and losses. I envied the liveliness, squeezed in to watch. A certain soldier took out a gold coin, wanting to gamble with a man wearing sheepskin. The "owner" politely advised him, saying, "It is either win or lose, it is not easy for soldiers to earn money, please don't." The soldier insisted, but unfortunately lost. He then snatched the gold coin back and left. The winner dared not say anything. A few days ago, Mr. Liu Shengwu invited me to a dinner. At the table, guests talked about "the reclamation army borrowing farmers' farming tools, employing farmers to cultivate for them, not only wasting the farmers' cultivation time, but also exploiting them with high interest," etc. At first, I dared not believe it, but now, watching Xiangqi, I began to believe it.</p>
<p>Agricultural products in Hetao, in addition to rice, include many kinds of grains and vegetables. Among them, the cabbage, with each seedling weighing thirty or forty catties, and the melon seeds, with the famous name of "Dingxin Bai," are especially popular. It is a pity that the land is vast and the population is sparse, with a total population of less than 100,000. On average, each person can obtain two qing of land. No wonder many people just sit and watch it lie fallow. In the old days, prices were very cheap. One yuan for white flour could buy forty catties, more than thirty catties of millet, fifty or sixty catties of oats, four or five chickens, more than one hundred eggs, and more than ten catties of beef, mutton, pork, and fish. Vegetables were even cheaper, not to mention. Therefore, even villagers eat meat, flour, and vegetables as common food. Now, due to military chaos, it is greatly different from the past. Cattle, horses, camels, pigs, and sheep have all been slaughtered and eaten. Bone piles are like mountains, unbearable to look at. Meat is very difficult to obtain, and flour is also surprisingly expensive, only seven or eight catties per yuan. The rest can be inferred by analogy. Idle soldiers along the way sell goods to the people. Camels are five or six jiao each, mules and horses are two or three yuan. Some even use their guns to exchange for a full meal or five or six eggs.</p>
<p>From Baotou to Ningxia, passing through Wuyuan and Linhe, you can reach it by car in as little as four days. However, recently, due to ice melting and rising water levels, cars cannot pass. Moreover, the war in Ningxia has just ended, and there are often illegal acts by roaming bandits and scattered soldiers along the way. Therefore, travelers are cautious and mostly detour elsewhere, or take the Ping-Sui Road to Datong and transfer to the Longhai</p>
<p>Road westward, which takes about ten days, or hire a small Yellow River boat, dragged upstream by manpower, which takes two or thirty days, or ride a camel, go through the Hexi grasslands, which also takes twenty days. There are mostly deserts along the way, rarely populated, and the people you encounter are not kind, hence the saying "Rather encounter a camel than a person." The reporter is unwilling to retrace the same route and detour through Shaanxi, and wants to appreciate the desert scenery. What is the true picture? I have already prepared for the journey, joined a camel transport merchant group, and decided to depart tomorrow (21st), which will take about twenty days to reach Ningxia, and then I will see the readers again.

Now that they have occupied our Northeast, they can do whatever they want. Therefore, they completed the other four roads last year, with only the Changda Road remaining unfinished. However, in mid-March of this year, they started construction again. The entire road is approximately 800 Chinese miles long. Because there are no mountains or rivers along the line, the progress is quite rapid. The roadbed has now been laid, and it is expected to be open to traffic in September. The intentions and passing points of the Japanese's active construction of this road are also very noteworthy.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese army occupies our Northeast, the Soviet Union, because of the talisman of the Chinese Eastern Railway, causes inconvenience to the Japanese in every way. Although the Japanese tried to buy it, the Russians played along and refused to give up easily. The Japanese, in view of this, spared no effort to destroy the road. Daan is also an important town in northern Manchuria, located at the junction of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces. Once the Changda Road is built, the Japanese can go straight from Dalian to northern Manchuria, cutting off the Russians' return route, making it impossible for the Russians to dare to easily leave the country and drive straight to Harbin, then the value of the Chinese Eastern Railway will be completely lost. This shows the importance of Changda Road.</p>
<p>The abundance of soybean production in the Northeast is world-renowned, especially in northern Manchuria. Exports rely entirely on the transportation of the Chinese Eastern Railway, so the road's income is astonishing. The Japanese are unwilling to have the Soviet Union obtain such a large profit, so they are determined to build the Changda Road. In the future, after the road is completed, the Chinese Eastern Railway will not only lose its military value, but also its freight transport will probably be unattended. At that time, even if the Russians do not want to sell, they will not be able to.</p>
<p>Daan is located in the Songhua River Basin, with a suitable climate and abundant production of various crops. Because water transportation is also very convenient, commerce is very developed. There are also many fish produced there, with cheap prices, sometimes selling for one cent per catty. Therefore, Japanese industrialists have raised funds to set up a large-scale fish canning company, which is now being prepared and can begin production in May. The fish produced in the Moon Lake accounts for 70% of the total. The lake has now been bought by the Japanese at a low price. At the same time, according to the measurement results of the South Manchuria Railway Company, the lake can generate 800,000 horsepower of hydroelectric power. A hydroelectric power plant is currently being funded. The Japanese are so active in operating because they want to turn the area into an important town in northern Manchuria and an industrial center.</p>
<p>The road starts from Changchun County in Jilin, passes through Nong'an and Fuyu counties, and ends at Daan County in Heilongjiang. It then connects to the Baichengzi Station of the Taoang Road in the north (now changed to Taoan County). After the completion of this road, Japan's railway network plan in the Northeast will also be fully realized.</p>

<p>At that time, I met with the Director of the Henan Finance Department. During our conversation, I learned that the central government was convening a national financial conference. Upon returning to the province, the order from the ministry had already arrived. After reading it, I learned that the conference was scheduled for May 21st. The materials requested from our province include the collection status of land taxes in each county and the budget books of each county in the province. However, our province is vast, with 131 counties under its jurisdiction. A single order would take at least six or seven days to reach all of them, and the preparation of budget books is no small task. Therefore, whether they can be completed and sent to this department before the conference is also a question. The department has issued multiple telegrams in recent days, ordering all counties to expedite the process. The conference is scheduled to be held on May 21st, and I plan to arrive on the 17th or 18th. I am preparing several proposals regarding the issues of our province to be submitted to the conference for discussion. Although we dare not expect any assistance from the central government in the current situation of our province's finances, this is a rare opportunity to present our province's predicament. Currently, the tax revenue in our province is the same as last year, with only a slight recovery in the war zones. However, due to special circumstances, there are obstacles to collection. The total annual revenue budget for the province before the war was 18 million. After the war, with the exemption of land taxes in the war-affected counties, it decreased by more than 4 million. The total annual expenditure for the province is more than 18 million, excluding temporary expenditures. Therefore, not counting temporary expenses, there is a shortage of more than 4 million. Temporary expenditures, such as the disbandment of various teams in the war zones and the recent expenses for the disbandment of the special police in Yutian, are all urgently needed, and their amounts are difficult to predict. The provincial treasury bears the most burden of these expenses, with an average monthly deficit of more than 300,000, which is being covered by scraping together funds. Chairman Yu Shu admonished me, saying, "When living in poverty, one must grit one's teeth and work hard." Hebei is now making a living by working hard in this poverty. Therefore, we are taking out loans every month to pay government expenses. For example, the expenses for various agencies in March were paid after obtaining a loan from the Provincial Bank, which will begin to be distributed tomorrow. Such difficult circumstances will be explained in detail at the upcoming national financial conference. (27th)</p>

<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: After suppressing bandits in northern Anhui last year, the 7th Division of the 3rd Army returned to garrison in Xuzhou and Bengbu for reorganization and training, which has lasted for several months. Wang Jun had previously telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to dispatch personnel for inspection. The Military Affairs Commission designated Ye Nanfan as the chief inspector, and the Training Supervision Department dispatched Infantry Supervisors Zhang Gongda and Lin Rifan, the Military Administration Department dispatched Reserve Division Qiu Wenhua, and the Military Medical Division dispatched Xiong Jiping as inspection committee members. They arrived in Xuzhou from Nanjing at the end of last month. On the morning of the 1st, a military parade was held at Jiuli Mountain, with thousands of people from various agencies, organizations, and schools attending to observe the ceremony. The 39th Regiment of the 7th Division stationed in Xuzhou and the 37th and 38th Regiments stationed along the eastern and western routes, as well as the division's directly subordinate units such as the artillery battalion, engineer battalion, cavalry company, and special services, were all gathered for the parade. Division Commander Zeng Wanzhong served as the commander-in-chief. The parade began with Wang Jun accompanying Ye Nanfan and other inspection committee members, as well as representatives from various sectors, inspecting the troops for a week. Then came the marching parade, with each unit passing in front of the command platform in high spirits and with orderly steps. After the parade, technical skills were randomly tested, including bayonet practice, combat training, individual training, squad, platoon, and company training, martial arts, etc., and the results were remarkable. On the morning of the 2nd, internal affairs were inspected, and in the afternoon, academic subjects were tested. On the 3rd, a full roll call was conducted. On the 4th, live ammunition shooting took place, and special forces demonstrated explosions. On the 5th, 6th, and 7th, field exercises were conducted, with plans to form eastern and western detachments. The troops stationed along the eastern route were designated as the eastern detachment, and the troops stationed in Xuzhou and Bengbu were designated as the western detachment. The exercise area extended along the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. After the inspection in Xuzhou is completed, they will proceed to Bengbu to inspect the troops stationed there. (3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Recent Situation in the Bandit Area of Changting; Mao Zedong Recuperating in Ruijin; Zhu De's Whereabouts Highly Secret <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Since a certain division of the Fujian Western Bandit Suppression Army captured Dayang Dam in Yongding on the 21st, a certain 3rd Division of the 4th Column has formed a communication line from Xinquan, Pengkou to Dayang Dam, 60 li from Liancheng and 140 li from Changting. Changting has been a bandit area for several years and has become a bandit nest, along with Ruijin, forming the bandit base. The county town of Changting is only 80 li from the town of Ruijin, and its importance is evident. The target of the Fujian Western Bandit Suppression is Changting. If Changting is recovered, the puppet capital will be difficult to defend, and the suppression of the Jiangxi bandits can be completed. According to those who fled from the Changting bandit area to Zhangzhou, the Central Army has been vigorously suppressing the Red bandits in various counties, and the puppet 3rd and 5th Army Corps have suffered the most losses, with over a thousand killed or wounded. Over two hundred were carried back to Changting for medical treatment. In early April, over two thousand Red bandits were sent from Ruijin to Changting, but only two-thirds had rifles. The next day, they set off for the border between Tinglong, Bian, and Nanyang Dam. Recently, most of the Red bandits in Changting have retreated to Ruijin and Huichang, leaving only a few hundred. In mid-April, a certain division of the Central Army in Longyan launched a two-pronged attack on the Baisha Red bandits from Xiaochi and Dayang Dam. There were several thousand bandits in the area. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the National Army captured Xiaochi, and the bandits retreated to the Changfang area on the morning of the third day. The National Army sent teams to search and suppress them on one hand and pursue them on the other. Most of the remaining bandits are now gathered near Jiuxian (place name). The bandits have designated Nanyang, Jiuxian, and Baisha in the Fujian Western region as two lines of defense. Now that Baisha has been recovered by the National Army, the first line of defense has been lost. As for the second line of defense, since the recovery of Baisha near Jiuxian, the Longyan garrison has sent personnel to Shanghang to purchase rice and grain. Now the route between Baisha and Shanghang has been opened, and the Central Army has established contact with the Guangdong Army in Shanghang. Mao Zedong, the head of the Red bandit's puppet political department, has recently had a relapse of his lung disease and is recuperating in the Shachou Dam area of Ruijin. He lives in a cave dug in the ground to avoid air raids. The cave is very large and can accommodate a hundred people. Zhu De wears the same uniform as the bandit soldiers, and those who are not familiar with Zhu De's face cannot distinguish him. Recently, with the National Army launching attacks on the bandit nests from all directions, his whereabouts are even more secret. Women in Liancheng between the ages of twenty and forty have all been abducted by the bandits to serve in the women's teams and as scouts. Those who resist slightly are accused of being counter-revolutionaries and executed by shooting. The number of bandits in Liancheng is also large. (April 25th)</p>

<p>Changsha Dispatch: The units participating in the bandit suppression in the Western Route include three columns, under the jurisdiction of fifteen divisions and two independent brigades. Over the past few months, they have achieved significant results. He Jian recently submitted a report to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the general situation of bandit suppression in the Western Route and notified all parties. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e101">First Column The area under the jurisdiction of the First Column is under the command of Commander Liu Jianxu, with Wang Dongyuan, Peng Wei <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Ren Chen Guangzhong and other divisions, working hard to suppress the bandits. They have successively recovered the county towns of Lianhua, Ninggang, Anfu, Ji'an, Xiajiang, Yongxin, Taihe, Wan'an, and Suichuan, and many villages and towns in the counties have been organized. There are no scattered bandits. Within the territory, there are only the puppet 17th and 18th Divisions, the Xiao Ke and Cai Huiwen units, totaling about four or five thousand people, with no more than half of them armed. Commander Liu is now using the bunker advancement method, encircling the Xiao Ke and Cai Huiwen bandits in the mountains of Heshan, Huaxi, Shangxingxia. He is gradually advancing, shrinking the bandit area day by day, and gathering them to annihilate them. If they can be resolved this time, the bandits in the First Column area will be completely eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Second Column <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Second Column originally took Pingxiang, Wanzai, Tonggu, Gao'an, Shanggao, Yifeng, Xiushui, Yichun, and Fengxin as its scope, responsible for suppressing the puppet 16th Division's Kong Hechong, Gao Yongsheng, and other bandits. Under the command of Commander Liu Yinggu, with Tao Guang, Zhu Yaohua, Yue Sen, and Li Jue's divisions, they broke through the Xiaoyuan old nest. After nearly two months of long pursuit, the bandit units have been broken up and scattered in all directions. Scattered bandits carrying weapons to surrender are continuously on the road, obtaining more than a thousand rifles. Now only the Gao Yongsheng bandit gang remains, with only a few hundred rifles, hiding in the Taoshu'ao Zaoxi area. All county towns and important towns have been occupied by the National Army. Now two divisions, without distinguishing borders, are advancing towards the Gao bandits. The Gao bandits are not strong and can be eliminated soon.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Third Column <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>

<p>Liu Peixu and other independent brigades, after breaking through Mount Wugong, the puppet 3rd Division's Ye Jinbo unit disintegrated and fled in all directions. Now in the area of the Third Column, in Ruichang, Yongxin, Wuning, Yangxin, Puqi, Tongshan, Tongcheng, and Daye, there are no longer any organized bandit gangs. The remaining scattered bandits have been divided into four zones by Commander Chen for active suppression, and he is sure to achieve the effect of early elimination. (April 25th)</p>

<p>A Police Officer Accused of Neglecting His Duty: Gu Yeyu's house on Dong Street in Tinglin Town was robbed by bandits, and the relatives Yao and Wang were kidnapped upon leaving. The police officer, surnamed Hui, at the town's branch bureau neglected his duty, allowing the bandits to escape far away, causing dissatisfaction among the Gu family and the entire town. They have repeatedly telegraphed the provincial office requesting a thorough investigation. The two kidnapped girls are still missing. Gu's wife, Yao, is unwilling and has filed a complaint with the procuratorate against the chief of the branch bureau and the four patrol officers, accusing them of neglecting their duty. This case has attracted the attention of the local people, and it has been scheduled to open a preliminary investigation court on the afternoon of the 7th to summon relevant witnesses for questioning.</p>

<p>The case of Liu Zhuomin, former chief of the Second Public Security Branch Bureau, and his wife Liu Li (namely Wen Rongzhen), refusing to hand over affairs and obstructing official duties, has now been prosecuted by Qian Chengjun, the chief prosecutor of the local branch court, to the criminal court of the same court. Liu Zhuomin is prosecuted for the crime under Article 144 of the Criminal Code, and Liu Li is prosecuted for the crime under Article 146. Whether Gu Li Shuyun incited obstruction of official duties is being investigated in another case. The procuratorate has scheduled a court hearing to investigate Gu Li Shuyun at 1:00 PM on the 12th of this month. The summons for Gu Li Shuyun was delivered to Yu Tianxi, the director of Chao Kun's law firm in Wuxi, yesterday (4th) for forwarding. It is still unpredictable whether Gu Li Shuyun will be able to appear in court at that time.</p>

<p>The Provincial Security Office, in order to reorganize the police teams and security corps in various counties, has dispatched special commissioners to different regions for inspection and has appointed Bai Zhujun as an inspector to come to Wuxi for inspection. Now Mr. Bai has scheduled to come to Wuxi on the 10th, and the inspection will be on the 11th or 12th.

Each soldier coming to the city for the inspection should be given a meal allowance of 2 dimes and a travel allowance. 2. The number of officers and soldiers from each company and platoon coming to the city for the inspection, except for the garrison troops, should be at least nine from each squad. The minimum number is 87 officers and soldiers from the first and second companies, 54 officers and soldiers from the second independent platoon, and 30 officers and soldiers from the third independent platoon. 3. Those who have not submitted the roster previously issued by the headquarters, as well as the stationing location table of each company, must submit them to the department by May 6th. 4.

<p>In recent years, the silk market has plummeted, and silk factories have suffered a sharp decline, closing down one after another. The sale of raw silk in the European and American markets is hindered by the dumping of Japanese silk and due to China's adherence to traditional methods, without knowing how to improve. As a result, sales have been stagnant, with almost no foothold. Recently, Xue Shou Xuan, the director of the local Huaxin Silk Factory, in order to rescue the situation, has specially sent Xue Zukang, the director of the silk manufacturing training institute of the factory, to go to the United States to promote Wei silk and to investigate the products of various European and Japanese countries for reference. Now Mr. Xue has gone to Shanghai yesterday to wait for the ship to go abroad.</p>

<p>The security corps in the county has never had dedicated funding. In the past, the corps in each district collected donations locally, totaling more than 200,000 yuan per year for the entire county. Later, the county government prepared an estimate and submitted it to the Finance Department and Security Office, requesting that starting this year, a surcharge of 5.5 cents per mu be levied under the land price tax item, but the order has not yet been approved. Now that the headquarters has been established, according to the new plan, A and B security companies should be formed. Before the funding is determined, a temporary allocation of 11,700 yuan will be made from the local general reserve fund. Yesterday (3rd), the county government affairs meeting discussed and decided to submit a request to the Finance Department to approve the collection of land tax surcharge.</p>

<p>The amount of land price tax arrears in the county from the 17th year to the 21st year reached a total of 280,000 yuan. The Provincial Finance Department, in order to clear the arrears, sent Commissioner Chen Nai to reside in the county to clear them. The new tax for the 22nd year, from December 1st to the end of April of this year, has collected 49.8% of the total. The county reported to the provincial department. The province believes that the county has a habitual arrears of grain and taxes. If it is not rectified, it will repeat its past mistakes. Therefore, the county magistrate, Zhou Heng, and the directors of the east and west counters for grain collection are ordered to recover 80% of the amount by the end of June of this year, otherwise the county magistrate and the two directors will be dismissed and punished. In this situation of rural economic bankruptcy, it is quite difficult to collect the arrears. Therefore, the county government has found it difficult to comply with the order.</p>

<p>Yang Meimei, a notorious bandit rampant in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, was a subordinate of Tai Bao Ashu and was as famous as Zhuluo Amei. Since Tai Bao Ashu was brought to justice, Yang Meimei led the remaining crowd and became their leader, committing more than 70 cases. A few days ago, they robbed Xiaozheng Town and kidnapped Cao Boming, the mayor of Xiaozheng Town, demanding 1,000 yuan. The meeting was scheduled to take place at Fengjing Town in the county. Yang's bandits were hiding in an opium den in Fengjing, and the matter was learned by Fei Gongxia, the captain of the Songjiang Water Patrol Team, who personally led the ship captain Tang Shuqin, scout Xia Chungen, and other police officers to Fengjing. They saw Yang Meimei on the street and immediately captured him and four other bandits. They were taken to Songjiang that night. After interrogation by the Water Police Headquarters, they confessed that they had been bandits for 19 years. Recently, they robbed Xiaozheng Town, Zhangliantang Town, and Shenjia浜 Yuan厙 and other places. They lived in taverns and enjoyed themselves with prostitutes for nearly four years. Now that they have been captured, they are certain to die. However, there are still long guns and cash hidden in the home of their mistress, Xu Sanniangzi, and with Cao Rongfu, the commander of the Xiaozheng Security Corps. After the Water Police Team Headquarters obtained the confession, in addition to detaining Yang and his gang, they also sent a team to bring Xu Sanniangzi and Cao Rongfu to justice.</p>

<p>Yesterday (4th) at around 1:00 PM, the Jiu Hua Silver Shop outside the Drum Tower in Hangzhou was suddenly visited by a robber dressed as a worker, who held a bill of sale and purchased two gold rings weighing two mace each and a pair of earrings weighing two mace each. The shop clerk did not suspect anything and took the goods to the counter for him to choose. The robber took advantage of the clerk's preparation and grabbed the gold jewelry and fled. The clerk shouted for the police to pursue him. He was captured at Wangxian Bridge by police officer Zhou Junjie. In desperation, the robber threw the gold jewelry on the side of the road in an attempt to destroy the evidence. After being detained and interrogated by the First Branch Bureau, he confessed his name as Wang Chunsheng, 44 years old, from Shaoxing, and admitted to planning the robbery. He was sent to the General Bureau and then to the court for trial on charges of robbery in broad daylight.</p>

<h3 id="e114">On the Issue of Promulgating the Constitution (Continued) – A Reply to Mr. Wu Jingxiong – <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuanruo</p>
<p>Considering the process of constitutional development in various countries, the promulgation of their constitutions is also tailored to the times. The Magna Carta, initially promulgated in England, only restricted the power of the monarch to tax. Later, in 1679, 1688, 1911, 1918, and 1928, it was gradually supplemented. France initially promulgated only the Organic Law of the Senate and the Government, which was also incomplete. Since then, it has been amended over the years. Similarly, the implementation of the Finnish Constitution is determined by law (Article 95 of the Finnish Constitution). The promulgation of the Prussian Constitution only put Articles 31-43 and 86 into effect. The remaining articles were implemented after the new elections of the state council according to Article 74 (Article 88 of the Prussian Constitution). The Polish Constitution came into effect from the date of promulgation, and some of its articles, which need to be implemented by other laws, came into effect from the date of implementation of those laws (Article 126 of the Polish Constitution). The Lithuanian Constitution came into effect from the date of promulgation, but must be approved by national referendum within ten years at the latest (Article 107 of the Lithuanian Constitution). The Siamese Constitution came into effect from the date of promulgation, but is still subject to the restrictions of temporary provisions (Articles 64-65 of Chapter 7 of the Siamese Constitution). From this, it can be seen that the promulgation and implementation of a constitution must be tailored to the special requirements and environment of the nation, with the necessary discretion and flexibility.</p>
<p>The difficulty of China's constitutional problem does not lie in the creation of a good legal system, but in the promotion of the rule of law. The spirit of the rule of law is not only limited to the written legal code, but also values the implementation, protection, observance, and popularization of the law. The drafting of laws is easy and temporary, but the implementation, protection, observance, and popularization of laws depend on the development of the spirit of the rule of law and the cultivation of public habits. It is difficult, time-consuming, and difficult to achieve results. The Chinese people have long lacked the spirit of the rule of law. Therefore, the result of the reform and change was that new laws and old habits initially had no relationship or influence. The new laws were new, but the people remained old, accustomed to their old habits. After the change of era, the Chinese people were still eager for success without considering the fundamentals. The constitution they made was still not consistent with the habits of the people. Therefore, if we want to achieve constitutional success today, we should strive to cultivate the spirit of governance and consolidate the foundation of the rule of law during the crucial period of tutelage, so that the future laws can be integrated with the people and consistent with the people's spirit and habits, and no longer depart from the people and run counter to them. The success or failure of this tutelage work is the key to the social order and the success or failure of the constitution in our country (see my book "Politics and the Rule of Law in Twenty Years" 3.2. Central Daily News). Therefore, when the provisional constitution was drafted a few years ago, I wrote an article explaining that the main purposes of the provisional constitution were: 1. To complete revolutionary doctrine; 2. To promote the development of civil rights; 3. To build local autonomy; 4. To cultivate the spirit of the rule of law (see my book "The True Meaning of the Provisional Constitution" May 7, Ta Kung Pao). Now that the period of tutelage is not yet complete and local autonomy has not been achieved, the spirit of the constitution at this time should still be based on these four purposes, and its practical use should be limited to "trying out the five-power government" (as stipulated in Article 19 of the Founding Program). Before the constitution is promulgated, "the presidents of all institutes shall be appointed and dismissed by the President and supervise them" (Article 21 of the Founding Program). The draft constitution should be based on the Founding Program and the achievements of the tutelage and constitutional periods, and should be deliberated by the Legislative Yuan and publicized to the people at any time (Article 22 of the Founding Program). It must not be hastily set a two-month period for public comment, and as for its promulgation and implementation, it should be in accordance with Article 23 of the Founding Program, which stipulates that the National Assembly should be convened to decide on the promulgation after more than half of the provinces in the country have reached the period of constitutional start-up, that is, the complete establishment of local autonomy in the entire province.</p>
<p>Dai Jitao said in a letter to Sun Zhesheng, the president of the Legislative Yuan, "If our comrades do not legislate for the long-term plan of the country and for the benefit of the people, or arbitrarily enforce the law, or enact it without implementing it, it will not complete the people's way. Therefore, for two years, I have repeatedly said that the provisional constitution should be implemented. Now, the convening of the National Assembly to create a constitution is of greater significance than the provisional constitution, but if the attitude of the Chinese people remains the same as their attitude towards the provisional constitution, then its constitution will only lead to political stagnation, and the chaos and the demise of the country may arise from it. The Chinese people today still have a ray of hope in the future, thinking that the National Assembly has not yet been convened, and the constitution has not yet been formulated. After the constitution is promulgated, the task of revolution and nation-building of the Kuomintang will reach its final stage. If it cannot be implemented, or if it is implemented with major defects, then the hope of the people will be exhausted, and unexpected changes may occur." His words are serious and profound, and I truly agree with them.</p>
<p>In short, the great cause of constitution-making is everlasting, and the order and chaos of the country depend on it. It should not be arbitrarily written or hastily done. My humble opinion is self-examined and sincere. I hope that those who are experienced and plan for the country will deeply consider it (The End).</p>

A portrait of the Prime Minister was hung in the center of the stage, with the Party and national flags crossed on both sides. The meeting agenda and slogans were posted on both sides. Banners were posted all around the venue, and the Public Security Bureau sent police officers to protect the venue and the entrance. The arrangement was quite simple and tidy.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Attending Representatives <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>

<h3 id="e119">Chairman's Report <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>First, Chairman Tong Xingbai gave a report, saying in brief: "Today is the 13th anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government. Why should we commemorate the establishment of the Revolutionary Government thirteen years ago? Because this was the day when the Prime Minister took office as the Extraordinary Grand President, which has a significant relationship with the future of our nation and country. During this commemorative period, we recall the history from the founding of the Republic to the tenth year of the Republic, during which many difficulties occurred in politics, and the political organizations and forms underwent abnormal changes. The government was often manipulated by ambitious people. Therefore, in order to promote the revolution, the Prime Minister had to change the sluggish situation. At that time, some people believed that the revolution was successful when the Republic was established and the Manchu Qing Dynasty was overthrown. However, the Prime Minister thought otherwise. He felt that the revolution would not be successful unless the Three Principles of the People were realized and the will of the whole country was unified. Therefore, he would rather resign from the position of Provisional Grand President and organize a revolutionary government in Guangzhou, using the power of the Party to destroy the remnants of feudalism, such as Yuan Shikai, who proclaimed himself emperor, and Zhang Xun, who restored the monarchy, and other rebellious acts, which made the principles of Chinese politics disappear. The Prime Minister fought with all his strength, so the Guangzhou Revolutionary Government was finally established. This is from the perspective of the country. As for the imperialists abroad, they colluded with a group of politicians and warlords to carve up China. As a result, most of the unequal treaties were signed at that time, which is really heartbreaking. In order to fulfill his aspiration to save the country and the people, the Prime Minister tried his best to promote the Extraordinary National Assembly and the Revolutionary Government in Guangzhou. Therefore, the Revolutionary Government in the tenth year of the Republic was of great significance in the history of the Republic. This is the first point. Secondly, after the establishment of the Revolutionary Government, the Prime Minister never used the power of the Guangdong border to seize power. He wanted to use Guangzhou as a base to unify the whole country. Therefore, the first thing after the establishment of the Revolutionary Government was the Northern Expedition. After capturing parts of Hunan and Jiangxi, Chen Jiongming rebelled in Guangzhou, so he returned to suppress it. After destroying Chen's rebellion, there was a second Northern Expedition, which laid a very solid foundation for our Party. In the fifteenth year of the Republic, Commander-in-Chief Chiang's third Northern Expedition followed the Prime Minister's last will, and the country was mostly unified by the seventeenth year. If we trace the origin, it was based on the establishment of the Revolutionary Government in the tenth year of the Republic. In the future, our comrades who die later must continue the Prime Minister's last will and support our current leader to complete the unification. If there are rebels who want to disturb the unification of China, we must all rise up and attack them. Thirdly, the Prime Minister, during his lifetime, adhered to the spirit of unyielding and fought against the powers, and would never give an inch of China's land to foreigners. In Guangdong, he fought with foreigners over the tariff issue. No matter how the imperialists used their power to threaten, the Prime Minister would never lose a bit of the country's interests. Therefore, the establishment of the Revolutionary Government was also to deal with imperialism. Even today, although the three northeastern provinces have been taken away by violent Japan by force, in law, we have never signed or recognized it. Japan uses the issues of through trains and through mail to lure us, but the government has not been tempted so far. Japan's recent statement that Japan has a special status in China and that Western countries cannot interfere has been severely refuted by our government. The outside world does not understand and has doubts, but it does not know that the government's strategy has never changed. However, because the current strength is still insufficient, there is hope to recover the lost land in the future when the domestic strength is sufficient. This depends on our efforts."</p>
<h3 id="e120">Chen's Speech <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Next, Mayor Wu's representative Chen Kecheng gave a speech, saying, "Today is the anniversary of the May 5th Revolutionary Government, which is also the anniversary of the Prime Minister's assumption of the office of Extraordinary Grand President. Mayor Wu is one of the members of the presidium of this meeting and was scheduled to attend on time. However, because there is also a workers' movement conference in the city at the same time, and the municipal government is also holding a commemorative meeting, the time conflicted, and he could not arrive in time. Therefore, he specially sent my brother to represent him. Today's commemoration, in today's situation of both internal and external troubles, we recall the great spirit of the Prime Minister leading our Party to fight against evil forces in difficult and arduous times, which makes us feel infinite admiration and emotion. In the ten years from the Prime Minister's death to the present, our Party vowed to launch the Northern Expedition and eventually unified the country. The initial cause of the revolution is about to be completed, but what follows is the invasion of foreign enemies and the harassment of red bandits. The invasion of foreign enemies is to cut off our revolutionary path, and the harassment of red bandits has disrupted our construction progress. At the same time, in the midst of external aggression and internal unrest, it has given some ambitious people the opportunity to harm the Party and the country. The Fujian Incident in the past was an example. Even though a huge price was spent to quell the Fujian Incident, the vitality of the entire country and nation was once again weakened. Wanting to resist foreign aggression without internal stability, and talking about resisting foreign aggression with other intentions, this is the general phenomenon in China today. Therefore, those who seek internal stability cannot do so freely, but foreign troubles continue to oppress them even more. If this situation does not change, China will be incurable. It is like trying to force a person whose thoughts are not correct to take a path that does not lead to heresy. Where does one start? I have already said that the invasion of foreign enemies is to cut off the revolutionary path. Then, will the way out for our country and nation be cut off because of this? Here, we have a very big premise, which is what method we should use to avoid being cut off, and what method we should use to make ourselves stronger. This kind of rational self-strengthening theory has been rarely paid attention to since the outbreak of national disasters. The enemy's planes and cannons can never be resisted by our empty talk on paper. Therefore, our only preparation is how to follow others to manufacture planes and cannons. To manufacture planes and cannons, we must put the strength of the entire country into it. Similarly, to gather the strength of the entire country, we must unify the country. The conclusion is to stabilize the internal situation first and then resist foreign aggression. Especially to stabilize the internal situation, we must quell the rebellion and exterminate the red bandits. Under this conclusion, we re-examine the general consciousness of the people in the past two years, but we cannot help but be disappointed. But what about our Party's work in the past two years? Even if we cannot be complacent, we cannot help but make us feel the rebellion has been quelled, and the red bandits have been wiped out. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the remarkable achievements are known to all Chinese people, and there is no need to say more. And the progress of various construction undertakings has been praised by British and American public opinion. From this, we can know that only our Party can save the country, and only our Party can fight in the midst of internal and external attacks and revive China. Similarly, the order of stabilizing the internal situation and resisting foreign aggression cannot be reversed, and it has firmly established its foothold in the iron-like facts. Speaking of this, we need to look at it from a higher level. Why is the general national consciousness so depressed? Some people say that this decadence is an inevitable stage in the transition from the old to the new era. Then, why has China's reform for thirty years not made progress in the new stage? Our answer is that the national thinking is not unified, and there are very few correct opinions to guide it. Therefore, what is manifested in the facts is the proof of the past two years since the national disaster. In the future, the work of our Party, in addition to the actual internal stability and construction, must also focus on correcting the general thinking of the people. To correct this decadent thinking and put it into practice in daily life, we must work harder to promote and implement the New Life Movement, to cultivate our great spirit from the New Life Movement of the small self, to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the country and nation in this extraordinary period. This is the significance of our commemoration of the Prime Minister today. Our slogans today are to commemorate the Prime Minister, to eliminate the reactionaries, to implement the New Life Movement, to work hard on construction, and to swear to eliminate national humiliation."</p>

<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reported that, regarding the issue of stabilizing flour prices, the Ministry of Industry, at the request of the China Industrial Federation, specially sent Liang Shangdong, the Director of the Department of Commerce, to Shanghai to investigate the truth.

<p>The Shenshi News Agency reported that, after the Japanese envoy Arima returned to the delegation, he met with Foreign Minister Hirota and important figures in the military department for several days to actively discuss the specific policies of diplomacy toward China. Japan recently believes that the diplomatic policy toward Britain and the United States has been effective, and the policy toward China can be fully decided. It will formally propose a threat of direct negotiations to our government. The central government, in view of the urgency of the situation, President Wang will go to Jiangxi to meet Chiang within one or two days to make all decisions. According to reliable sources, this meeting between Chiang and Wang will make final consultations on the recent Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues in order to seek a coping method. In the most recent week, the British and American envoys, and the Belgian envoy, have successively gone to Jiangxi to visit Chiang, all of which are closely related to our recent dynamics in Sino-Japanese negotiations. The British, American, Belgian, and other envoys stationed in China are eager to inquire about the true attitudes of all parties in the development of the Sino-Japanese issue, so as to report to their respective governments. According to the reporter of the Shenshi News Agency, it has been learned from another aspect that the date of the return to the north of Huang Fu, the chairman of the Pingzheng Committee who is currently staying in Hangzhou, must also be determined after the trend of Sino-Japanese diplomacy has been decided.</p>
<p>relief measures. Gu Xinyi, the chairman of the Flour Industry Association, specially hosted a banquet for Mr. Liang at the Yiyou Society on Sanma Road at noon to discuss methods. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Discussion of Methods <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Mr. Liang immediately</p>
<p>Visited the leaders of the China Industrial Federation to</p>
<p>Consult on ways to treat flour industry</p>
<p>At 12 o'clock, he accepted the invitation of Gu Xinyi, the chairman of the Flour Industry Association, for lunch at the Yiyou Society Club on Hankou Road. During the meal, he discussed the policy of stabilizing flour prices, and how to ensure the permanent way out for Chinese flour under this principle. Mr. Liang said on the spot that the fundamental reason for the current decline of the flour industry lies in the cost of raw materials and tariffs, but the treatment method is also extremely important. However, he still needs to solicit opinions on the relief measures and other related parts, and decide on the method after detailed consultation. It is estimated that it can be resolved after several more consultations.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Liang Shangdong's Talk <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>A reporter visited Mr. Liang at the Yiyou Society yesterday</p>
<p>And asked about the Ministry of Industry's opinion on relieving the flour industry. According to the conversation, the current situation of flour price decline is quite complicated. If one side is overemphasized, it will easily affect other issues. Therefore, it is better to consider in detail than to act hastily. However, the Ministry of Industry confirmed that the relief part is an urgent matter and should be carried out immediately to alleviate the current difficulties. I will stay in Shanghai for a few more days to discuss with relevant parties in detail, and decide on the treatment methods. After returning to Nanjing, I will start researching and then implement the relief measures.</p>

<p>Flour Industry Association and flour</p>
<p>Exchange and other related parties, investigate</p>
<p>The truth of the decline of flour</p>
<p>At the same time, he had another detailed talk with Gu Xinyi and others. The colleagues in the flour industry in this city believe that Mr. Liang came to seek relief and to stabilize market prices as a treatment method. Therefore, it was decided to convene a meeting in the near future to collect opinions for the reference of the discussion on relief measures.</p>

<p>Petition Results···The Hankou Anti-Drug Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has been advocating the anti-drug movement for ten years. Although the struggle has never been relaxed due to the harsh environment, it has recently learned that opium, red pills, and other substances are extremely poisonous, and sent representative Huang Jiajun to Hankou last month to investigate. Liu Yaochang, a member of the association in Hankou, Wu Deshi, the Chinese bishop of the Sheng Kung Hui, and Dunn, the adviser to Commander Zhang, accompanied him to visit Zhang Xueliang, the Deputy Commander of the Anti-Banditry of the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, to request strict prohibition in order to save the country. Huang Chen presented the situation he witnessed and vigorously advocated the advantages and disadvantages. Deputy Commander Zhang was extremely moved, and immediately transferred the petition to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, and asked Huang to draft the regulations and propose a prohibition plan as a basis for implementation. It is said that Huang Junye has returned to Shanghai after finishing his work. It is said that Chiang and Zhang have accepted the petition from the association and ordered the closure of all large and small opium dens in Hankou and Wuchang, and smoking by young people is absolutely prohibited. The order was implemented on April 30th, and there are also records in the special telegrams of various newspapers in recent days. The association was very pleased to receive reports from members in Hankou confirming that the opium dens in the city have been closed. It is said that the association is continuing its efforts to achieve the goal of complete purification. The statement submitted by Mr. Huang to Commanders Chiang and Zhang is excerpted below, "For the sake of regulations, opium is a poisonous substance that destroys the country and the people. All countries in the world have declared it a strict prohibition. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, our country was horrified by the fierce scourge of opium. Prohibition was necessary for survival. We spared no sacrifice and finally achieved the goal of prohibition, which was valued by the international community. In recent years, our country has been in constant chaos, foreign insults have been frequent, bandits have been everywhere, and disasters have continued. The scourge of opium has been rekindled, and it is even worse than at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Until today, the scope and degree of its poisoning has reached a point where it cannot be ignored. The arrogance of warlords, the corruption of politics, the exhaustion of the economy, and the bankruptcy of the countryside are all the steps that this thing has taken to become fierce. Furthermore, the aggression of strong neighbors, the failure of diplomacy, the decline of morality, and the decline of morale are all caused by opium. After the Japanese occupied the three northeastern provinces, they were eager to implement the public sale of opium. The colonial governments of various Nanyang countries wanted to control the overseas Chinese and also used opium to promote their rapid demise. The obvious lessons are all in front of us. Looking back at the domestic situation today, it is even worse than in the Northeast and Nanyang. Judging only by the amount of opium taxed by the Hankou Lianghu Special Tax Office, it was 100,000 dan in the 18th year of the Republic, 117,000 dan in the 19th year, 70,020 dan in the 20th year, 59,860 dan in the 21st year, and 71,756 dan in the 22nd year. The number of morphine, heroin, red pills, white pills, and other poisonous substances that are not taxed by the Hankou Special Tax Office or smuggled is not included. The number is even more alarming when calculated nationwide. Therefore, today, from the central government and military agencies to the local government, land and water military police, no one does not regard this as a source of wealth. Even courts, schools, groups, and newspapers are eager to share the profits equally. Therefore, the opium force is advancing by leaps and bounds, and the traffickers and opium merchants are extremely popular. To talk about prohibition is almost empty talk. However, opium prohibition is the only way to save the country. How can we abandon food because of choking and sit idly by?</p>
<p>From a general point of view, it seems that there is really no way to prohibit it. Therefore, the advocacy of banning in taxation and the provisions for public sale are rampant. Some use scientific opium prohibition as a slogan, or advocate turning private into public to move people. The authorities also believe that since there is no way to prohibit opium, it is better to collect taxes and allow sales to enrich the national treasury, and gradually prohibit it, which is better than letting it all fall into the hands of local military personnel, politicians, traffickers, and merchants. It is really a win-win situation. However, these methods have been tried repeatedly. The result is limited income and endless malpractices, which only make the scourge of opium spread day by day, and only create opportunities for corrupt officials, greedy officials, donation bandits, and upper merchants to make money. It is of no great benefit to the national treasury. What is the achievement of the Lianghu Special Tax and the ten-province opium prohibition today? It can be seen in general. Today, both at home and abroad, the reputation of the country is declining, foreigners are contemptuous, and at home, the officialdom is flooded and public opinion is boiling. All these are the evil consequences of opium taxes, and the losses outweigh the gains. I think it is already in your Excellency's awareness. My colleagues in the association have been refusing drugs for ten years, running around and calling out, and dare not slack off. However, our cotton power is limited and the effectiveness is not obvious. Although the environment is harsh, we still adhere to our long-standing advocacy and continue to struggle. We have presented the advantages and disadvantages to the central government and the governments of various provinces, and requested prohibition no less than dozens of times. However, the gentlemen in charge either regard it as insignificant or think that there is no way to do it. Therefore, we turn a blind eye to the requests of the people. But how can we sit idly by and watch the country perish and the species die out? Your Excellency is well-versed in the world situation and knows the suffering of the people. "For opium poisons, we must adopt the long-standing determination to deeply hate and thoroughly prohibit them, and properly plan a good method of fundamental prohibition, to lift the people out of the water and fire and lay the foundation of the country on a solid foundation. My colleagues should only contribute their years of research and the knowledge gained from domestic and foreign investigations and inspections. Here, we hereby put forward the following outline of recommendations for your Excellency's selection: 1. The government should hire experts from China and abroad on opium agricultural economics and other issues to conduct investigations, and based on the facts of the investigation, study opium prohibition methods that meet the needs of the facts. 2. The government should conduct surveys and provide full protection for opium, and facilitate the implementation according to the planned plan. 3. The central and local governments should compile statistics on the tobacco tax collected by the army and calculate the total amount. Experts should study and compensate for it from other sources. 4. The opening of new tax sources should be based on the principle of not affecting people's livelihoods and not disturbing social tranquility. 5. No matter what method is used to handle opium prohibition, it should be based on the principle of pure prohibition. The government should express its determination to strictly implement it, starting with military and political personnel, so as to restore the people's faith. 6. The government should select people with high moral character who are trusted by the people to take on the heavy responsibility of prohibiting politics, and should give them practical guarantees and necessary privileges to make it easy to achieve results. 7. The fines and any income from opium prohibition must not be used for military and political expenses, and should be allocated to fund drug rehabilitation and anti-drug education. 8. In handling opium prohibition, we should cooperate with the people on the one hand, such as surveying tobacco seedlings, arresting smuggling, prohibiting private sales, and banning smoking, in order to achieve thoroughness and rapid results. This responsibility can be taken over by the Anti-Smoking Supervisory Committee composed of fair people publicly recommended by the local legal groups. 9. The country has a vast territory, and it is not easy to prohibit it once and for all. Several provinces and regions should be designated to take the lead in order to establish a model for the provinces and increase the determination to follow it. 10. In order to ensure opium prohibition, the government should assist the anti-drug movement of the people and prohibit illegal officials from destroying it, so that it can help what the law cannot. At the height of the New Life Movement, opium prohibition should be listed as one of the work outlines. If the above ten outlines are accepted, then tens of thousands of families will be saved, and hundreds of generations will be fragrant. Your Excellency's achievements in saving the country and the people will be as long as the sun and the moon."</p>
<h3 id="e128">German侨 Celebrate National Day; Not to Commemorate International Labor Day; Statement by Mr. Barnick of the German Consulate <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Barnick, Acting Consul General of Germany in Shanghai, sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, "To the Editor, I have read in your newspaper's local news column on the 3rd of this month that regarding the German僑 celebrating the National Day, 'International Labor Day has been designated by German Prime Minister Hitler as the Commemorative Day for the German Brown Shirt Labor Vanguard.' In order to avoid misunderstandings, I hereby declare the following: The celebration and commemoration of May 1st in Germany has absolutely no international nature and is completely different from International Labor Day. The German government issued a decree on February 27 this year, stipulating May 1st as the German National Day, and the meaning of the celebration is the expression of the German people's cooperation with their motherland and nation, not the idea of international class struggle, such as the Marxist workers' May Day Labor Day held in other countries. May 1st in Germany is the same as the October 10th Double Tenth Festival in China, both are National Days. I hereby send this letter to your newspaper, and please check it."</p>

<p>Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai and Commander of the Songhu Garrison, recently received a secret report that Lu person Ma Chen and others impersonated Municipal Government Counselors, held Mayor Wu's business cards, forged letters, and falsely carved private seals, and went to various places in the city and other places to visit celebrities in an attempt to defraud them of money. Wu was furious when he heard about it, and ordered the military and police agencies under his jurisdiction to strictly arrest them, and also sent letters to the provincial and municipal governments to investigate and arrest them all, and bring them to justice.</p>

<h3 id="e130">The Residents of Peide Lane Had Their Water Turned On Yesterday, Thanks to Mediation by Feng Bingnan and Assistance from He Dekui; Tenants Declare They Will Not Bear the Increased Fees <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>A New Sound Society report states that the residents of Peide Lane on the Great West Road in the New Gate area had their water cut off by the water company at the behest of the landlord, who was unable to increase the water rates. Yesterday morning, Mr. Wang Xiangu, the lawyer representing the lane's residents, accompanied by representatives Wang Jieqing, Liu Chengyong, Huang Yaozu, Chen Silong, and others, went to the water company to negotiate with the Western deputy manager, Mr. Walter. Following mediation by Feng Bingnan, the Western manager's attitude was no longer as rigid as before. However, he still indicated that he needed to consult with the landlord before making a final decision, so no agreement was reached. Subsequently, they went to the Public Works Bureau to request the assistance of He Dekui. Mr. He also expressed considerable sympathy and agreed to negotiate with the water company. As a result, at 2:00 PM yesterday, the water company dispatched personnel to turn the water back on. Upon hearing the news, the residents of the entire lane were overjoyed and set off firecrackers, bringing the water cutoff dispute to a temporary end. However, according to the residents' representatives, although the company has restored the water supply, the residents will not bear the increased water fees if they are still paid by the landlord. If the residents pay themselves, they must deduct one-tenth of the ice money from the rent, in addition to the extra dollar. If this is not done, the more than three thousand tenants will not yield.</p>
<p>China Aviation Shanghai-Beiping</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Northbound Plane Was Grounded Yesterday; The Southbound Plane is Scheduled to Return from Tongzhou to Shanghai This Morning <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's weather was overcast, with a light rain in the morning, making air travel inconvenient. A Shen Shi News Agency reporter learned from China Aviation yesterday that the Shanghai-Beiping northbound plane, originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai yesterday morning, was rescheduled to fly to Beiping this morning due to the unfavorable weather conditions, for the sake of travel safety. As for the southbound plane on that route, which departed from Beiping the day before yesterday and was heading south, the weather suddenly changed en route, with thick fog, and it landed at the Nantong airport. It was originally scheduled to fly to Shanghai yesterday morning, but the weather did not clear yesterday. As of last night, the company had not yet received a report that the plane had taken off from Tongzhou. It is expected that it will be able to return to Shanghai this morning. Shanghai and Tongzhou are close to each other, and the flight only takes forty minutes. If it does not rain, there should be no major obstacles. As for the planes on the Shanghai-Chengdu route, they continued to fly as usual yesterday because the distances were shorter.</p>
<p>Tang Guanyu's Inspection</p>
<h3 id="e132">A Written Report on the Domestic Goods Factories in North China <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Tang Guanyu, a member of the Women's Domestic Goods Promotion Association, submitted a written report at the joint meeting of the three committee groups the other day. The report is recorded as follows: "On this trip, I was entrusted by the association to take the opportunity to visit domestic goods factories. It was my responsibility, but due to the limited time and my own limited abilities, I was unable to conduct a thorough investigation, which I regret. I will now provide a brief report based on my recollections. "[Beiping] In Beiping, I visited the following factories under the guidance of Mr. Chen Shiquan and Mr. Zhang Pengcai from the Municipal Party Department: (1) The Beiping Municipal People's Livelihood Carpet Factory, where I was shown around by Director Cheng Kuan. The raw materials used are very loose cotton threads, and the carpets are woven on wooden looms entirely by hand. The patterns are exquisite and artistically meaningful. This factory was established by the municipal government to support the livelihoods of the common people. (2) The Yanjing Carpet Company, where I was guided around by Mr. Ji Mengchun. The manufacturing method is the same as in (1). The patterns use colors, and the work is exquisite and beautiful. The facilities are also quite comprehensive. They pay close attention to worker welfare, such as labor hygiene. (3) The Tianyihe Enamel Factory, which produces the renowned Jingtailan (cloisonné enamelware). The manufacturing process involves first making objects out of copper, then embedding copper wires to create patterns, then coating them with various colors using materials from Boshan in Shandong, baking them, and then carefully polishing them by hand, resulting in an unusually bright and long-lasting finish. They sell a great deal to Western countries. (4) The Renli Industrial Company, where I was guided around by Manager Ling Qijun. The carpet department is on the ground floor, and the Boshan material department is upstairs. They produce various samples that resemble white jade and green jade, including flower vases, bowls, screens, and other items, all of which are bright and very beautiful. Various domestic goods companies in Shanghai often display them, but not very completely. According to a Renli company employee, most of these materials are sold to Western countries. (5) The Hebei No. 1 Prison Workshop, where I was guided around by Mr. Zhou Yuxiu. The building is circular and divided into two parts, each shaped like a fan. The first part is further divided into A, B, C, D, and E, and the second part is further divided into F, G, H, I, and J. The prison cells are connected to the workshops and are quite clean. The men's prison has a printing department, which is quite large. The products of its curtain department are exquisitely painted and are the best in Beiping, which is effective in resisting Japanese curtains. There is also a rattan ware department and a shoe department, which can also be relied upon to generate profits. In addition, there are woodworking and agricultural activities. Therefore, part of the building was built by the prisoners themselves with great skill, which shows the sanctity of labor. (6) Jade shops are located in the small alleys outside Chongwenmen, with numerous workshops. The production is exquisite. Beiping jade is truly a beautiful Chinese product. (7) There are many children's toy stores. The animal models they make are very lifelike and are made of flannel and old leather. The toy departments of the Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun department stores often display them. These are Beiping products. "[Tianjin]" In Tianjin, I was able to visit the factories thanks to a letter of introduction from Mr. Song Fei Qing, the manager of the Dongya Woolen Textile Company, who also offered to accompany me to other factories. His enthusiasm was commendable. (1) The Dongya Woolen Textile Company, where I was guided around by Manager Song Fei Qing. The scale is very large, and the facilities are quite well-organized. The raw materials selected can be described as pure. The Di Yang brand wool yarn produced is also quite smooth. The wool produced in China is slightly shorter and harder than that produced abroad, which is related to the breed of sheep (Japan does not produce wool). The dyes used to dye the wool are different from those used to dye yarn. Therefore, if yarn is mixed into the wool yarn, the yarn will not be colored, which shows that the raw materials for the wool yarn are entirely wool. (2) The Sheng Xifu Hat Shop, where I was accompanied by Mr. Song. Manager Zhou Yongze provided a thorough welcome. Most of the shop's work is done by hand, but there are a few small machines used to weave straw braids. The trademark is the Three Hats brand. They have both felt hats and straw hats. One type of thin felt hat has a brim that is woven from a combination of hemp thread, cotton yarn, and wool yarn. (3) The Renli Industrial Company Weaving Factory, which is a branch of the Renli Industrial Company of Beiping, where I was guided around by Deputy Manager Chen Li. The woolen fabrics, carpets, and other items woven are beautiful in color and the selection of yarn is exquisite. The scale is very large. (4) The Shengsheng Workshop, where I was accompanied by Mr. Song and Mr. Chen Xizhi from the YMCA. The workshop specializes in weaving jacquard blankets, which are made by hand on wooden looms. There are many patterns, all of which are considered excellent. They are woven purely from cotton yarn. The guide was Mr. Feng Yueqian. (5) The Yongnian Machine-Woven Cool Mat Factory, where I was guided around by Mr. Wang Fusun. The mat grass is purchased from Ningbo and woven on wooden looms. The printing of patterns has been prone to discoloration, but they now use steam printing and dyeing, which makes them durable and prevents discoloration. (6) The Mohong Magnetic Tile Factory, where I was guided around by Mr. Liu Fuzhai and Mr. Zhang. The raw material stone is produced in Tangshan, Tianjin. They manufacture glazed tiles, mosaic cement bricks, magnetic tiles, earthenware tiles, and ordinary bricks and tiles. The colors are bright, and the patterns are also good. I heard that they are quite durable and can compete with imported products. They can be adopted for new buildings. (7) The Tianjin Soap Company, which was founded nearly thirty years ago, produces Seven Star brand iron anchor soaps, Eight Trigram brand gourd brand medicinal soaps, various scented soaps, floral water, and snowflake cream cosmetics. Because they have chemical experts engaged in research, the colors and shapes can compete with foreign goods. (8) The North China Leather Company, where I was guided around by technician Zhou Naigeng. The enameled leather, flag leather, shoe upper leather, box leather, book cover leather, clothing leather, etc., made of cowhide are quite popular in the north. They have recently added the production of tire leather (used on various machines). In the past two years, the results have been gradually emerging. The highest quality is the Elephant brand, followed by the brand, which are both durable and long-lasting. The various leathers produced by the company also use the Elephant brand as a trademark. (9) The North Asia Industrial Factory, which specializes in the manufacture of buttons. There are many types, including Roman buttons and horn buttons, and the production is quite abundant.

<p>The Yingdou River in the first district of Shanghai County has recently become silted up, which is detrimental to agricultural irrigation. The local people in the area have planned to dredge it and immediately reported it to the county government to request funding. The county government then forwarded it to the provincial government, which approved a temporary levy of one dime per mu on the benefited fields on both sides of the river, which will be collected with the first installment of the land price tax in the 23rd year. The county government has now verified that the actual taxable mature fields benefited by the river are 2,664 mu, 1 fen, 8 li, and 9 hao in the 21st bao and 1st tu; 4,374 mu and 1 li and 2 hao in the 69th tu; 4,756 mu, 2 fen, and 4 li and 1 hao in the 54th and 55th tu; 961 mu, 7 fen, and 6 hao in the 42nd tu; 5,000 mu and 9 fen and 8 li in the 7th tu; and 3,312 mu, 3 fen, and 1 li and 1 hao in the 10th tu, for a total of 25,069 mu, 4 fen, 3 li, and 9 hao. Yesterday, the collection office was ordered to comply with the levy.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Ningbo Daily Seeks Support, the First Results Were Announced Yesterday, with More Than 1,700 Shares Obtained <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Daily's Restoration Movement Fundamental Readers' Congress, with Yu Qiaqing and Fang Jiaobo as the general and deputy captains, and Wu Yayi as the chief of staff, and various gentlemen and merchants from abroad and Shanghai serving as captains, separately sought support with the aim of raising 20,000 yuan to expand the newspaper's pages and purchase printing presses. Yesterday was the first day for announcing the results, and a luncheon was held at Yizhi Xiang. More than 30 people attended, including Fang Jiaobo, Wu Yayi, Xu Maotang, Yu Zuoting, Sun Meitang, Zhou Qiansheng, Wu Zhijian, Shao Xing, etc. General Captain Yu Qiaqing was unable to attend due to attending the preparatory meeting of Siming University and delegated Mr. Wu as his representative. Deputy General Captain Fang Jiaobo gave a speech, stating that although the Ningbo Daily is a local newspaper with a narrow scope, it is still an important opinion organ in the eyes of our fellow villagers. Moreover, since its creation eight months ago, it has indeed done a part for local welfare, such as the release of Rafu and the sealing of Jishengshenghui, which are too numerous to mention. This time, for a permanent plan, we are seeking funding and must achieve the goal so that it can exist for a long time. Furthermore, the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association was first created by our Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, and the Shanghai Local Daily was also the first by our Ningbo Daily. Recently, the Guangdong people in Shanghai have had the Shanghai Guangdong Daily to follow, and I hope that our Shanghai Ningbo Daily can be as prosperous as the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association and be imitated and followed by the general public. Then, Chief of Staff Wu Yayi gave a speech, saying that the organizer, Mr. Wang Beiping, was a colleague from the former Siming Daily, and his tireless and indomitable spirit is admirable. This time, in running the Ningbo Daily, he has been able to do the four words "hide evil and promote good", which is indeed commendable. In the future, when the funds are sufficient, we will further realize the goal of seeking welfare for the homeland and eliminating suffering for the villagers. Then, the captains reported the scores they had turned in, totaling 200 shares from Xu Maotang, 120 shares from Sun Meitang, 120 shares from Wang Boyuan, 120 shares from Chen Bogang, 120 shares from Zhou Zongliang, 100 shares from Chuan Xiao'an, 100 shares from Wu Qiting, 84 shares from Shao Xing, 60 shares from Yu Zuoting, 60 shares from Zhuang Honggao, 60 shares from Zhou Shuizhao, 60 shares from Dong Xinqin, 60 shares from Liu Sheng, 60 shares from Zhang Jingzhi, 50 shares from Wu Zhijian, 30 shares from Fang Shiru, and others who successively turned in shares, totaling more than 1,700 shares from Xiang Jiaonian, Shen Yimin, Chen Yanghe, etc. Finally, Chief Editor Zhang Jinglu gave a thank-you speech, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Tokyo News: After Mr. Wang Yitang attended the welcome meetings in Takano and Shizuoka in the east, more than 100 people from all walks of life in Tokyo, including Count Kiyoura, have also scheduled a meeting at the Electric Club on the 28th to welcome Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang arrived in Tokyo on the same day at 2:00 PM. There were many people from all walks of life welcoming him at the station, and the police department sent police to escort him. Mr. Wang shook hands with his old friends and famous figures from the Japanese government and the public. He then accompanied the personnel of our embassy to the hotel for a short rest and met with Ambassador Jiang, with whom he had a long conversation. At 6:00 PM, they attended the welcome meeting at the Electric Club together and met with Count Kiyoura, with whom he was very happy. About 200 people attended the meeting on that day, including President Tokuji, important figures from political and business circles, famous poets and writers, representatives of Buddhist associations, and representatives of women's circles. At 7:00 PM, they took their seats. Count Kiyoura and President Tokuji, as well as Doctors Hattori and Mikami, and former Tokyo Mayor Nagata, gave welcome speeches, expressing their hope for friendship between China and Japan. In his reply, Mr. Wang quoted Mencius's words, "Virtue, not force" and "Seek self, not others," saying that if the two countries could understand this true meaning, friendship would not be difficult to achieve. After Mr. Wang arrived in Tokyo, his old friends were happy to have the opportunity to meet him. Count Kiyoura, who is 80 years old, talked until the end of the banquet and insisted on continuing to meet in Kyoto. At 10:00 PM, Mr. Wang said goodbye and returned.

<h3 id="e140">The Membership Solicitation Meeting Opened Yesterday, with the First Announcement Soliciting 14,225 Points <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association held the opening ceremony of the ninth membership solicitation meeting in the lecture hall of the association at 6:00 PM yesterday, and the first membership scores were announced. More than 1,000 people attended, including General Captain Yu Zuoting, Chief of Staff Xu Maotang, Chen Runshui, Captains Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Jin Yansun, Mao Heyuan, Wu Zhihao, Hong Yanbin, Sun Meitang, Chen Zhonggao, Xu Qianxiang, Ge Weian, Shui Xiangyun, Xue Chunsheng, and team members Lin Huanzhang and Ni Rongtai. Mr. Fang Jiaobo was publicly elected as the temporary chairman, Dong Xinqin as the master of ceremonies, and Zhao Kuiyi as the recorder. The opening meeting and announcement situation are recorded below: The chairman's opening remarks briefly stated that since the completion of the new clubhouse until today, the membership solicitation meeting has been held a total of nine times. Each solicitation has exceeded the original goal. Although this is due to the enthusiasm and efforts of the captains and team members, it is also a manifestation of the Ningbo people's love and care for the fellow villagers' organization, which is why beautiful results have been obtained. Therefore, no matter what kind of organization in Shanghai holds a solicitation, none has been as enthusiastic as our association. This is what all fellow villagers are proud of. The last solicitation happened after the January 28th Incident, and the market was desolate and full of devastation. The members of the association were worried that the results would inevitably be reduced. The results exceeded the original goal by two-thirds. This kind of organizational spirit is really admirable. Although this solicitation is only on the first day, as evidenced by the enthusiasm of the fellow villagers and captains attending the meeting, and the perseverance of General Captain Yu Zuoting and Chiefs of Staff Xu Maotang and Chen Runshui, all of whom are young people, their spirit must be more abundant than before. In addition, the organization of each team in this session is based on industry, which is particularly sound. It can be predicted that it will definitely exceed the original goal. (A) The General Captain's speech: Zuoting was wrongly entrusted by the committee of the association to serve as the general captain of this membership solicitation meeting. As a native, I cannot refuse. Now the membership solicitation meeting is open. Our fellow villagers have always been known for their eagerness to help others, so previous solicitations have had excellent results. Now that the world is changing rapidly and the association's affairs are becoming more frequent, if we want to seek construction, we must first raise funds. I especially hope that you will work together to shoulder the heavy responsibility. The purpose of this solicitation is to collect 30,000 members and 30,000 yuan in membership fees, which is set at 100 teams. I rely on your enthusiasm and care to organize and establish the teams, and I am privately fortunate and indescribable. However, the period for this solicitation is only one month, and I still hope that you will actively carry out the work and make it a success, which will be infinitely beneficial to the association and the fellow villagers. Zuoting is also honored to be a part of it. (B) Speeches by Mr. Hong Yanbin, Mr. Wu Zhihao, and Mr. Shui Xiangyun (omitted).

<p>Zhuang Zexin, a field officer of the Zhifu Customs, at 3:00 AM on the first of last month, accompanied by inspectors and patrol teams, boarded a sampan to meet the Litong steamship arriving from Dalian. Unexpectedly, after the ship dropped anchor, it suddenly reversed, nearly colliding with the sampan. In a moment of urgency, Zhuang jumped into the water. At that time, the waves caused by the ship's propeller created a strong suction that pulled Zhuang into the bottom of the ship, causing him to drown. He left behind a wife and daughter, a truly tragic situation. Zhuang's brother, Zhuang Zezhong, currently the Deputy Commissioner of the Anti-Smuggling Department of the General Administration of Customs, went to Zhifu to handle the affairs upon hearing the news. All officers of the local customs and the General Administration of Customs, considering Zhuang's death in the line of duty, have not only sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting compensation but have also scheduled a memorial service at the Customs Club on Jing'an Temple Road at 2:00 PM on the 20th of this month to express their condolences.</p>

<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, the situation in Shanghai's pleasure quarters has been quite bleak recently. In April, 82,500 tickets for Japanese prostitutes were sold, a decrease of 100 tickets compared to the previous month. Only eight prostitutes were able to sell more than 1,000 tickets. After the Shanghai Incident, during the era of rampant sexual desire, the number of restaurants in the city increased to more than 160, with over 700 female waitresses. After reorganization, this number was reduced to 138, of which 47 were purely coffee shops, with a total of more than 430 female waitresses. Now, whether it is coffee shops or restaurants, the business situation has plummeted.</p>

<p>Chen Jinquan, a 20-year-old native of Ningbo who works as an employee at Dacheng Candle Shop at the corner of Dongjiadu inside the Limalu in Nanshi, impersonated Hu Gensheng, a rice merchant residing upstairs in the shop, at around 1:30 PM yesterday. He secretly called the Tongxing Money Exchange in Beishi, falsely claiming that he urgently needed to exchange 6,000 yuan. The money exchange, having previously had transactions with Hu, sent someone with the cash to exchange it. However, Hu Gensheng, realizing that he had not made the call, suspected an error and told the messenger that he did not need the money. Unexpectedly, Chen Jinquan then went upstairs and told the Tongxing messenger that his shop had borrowed Hu Gensheng's name to call for 6,000 yuan. The Tongxing messenger, knowing that the shop had also had transactions in the past, did not suspect anything and told Chen that they had sent 4,000 yuan first, and the remaining 2,000 yuan would be sent later. One party then handed over 4,000 yuan to Chen Jinquan. After Chen counted the money, he hid it in his pocket and told the Tongxing messenger to wait a moment while he went downstairs to get the exchange money. After saying this, he went downstairs and left. However, after half an hour, Chen had not returned, causing great alarm. They hurried downstairs to inquire and realized they had been deceived. However, Chen Jinquan had disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, the Tongxing messenger reported to the store, which in turn reported to the First District One Precinct, and the police ordered Hu Gensheng and the manager of Dacheng to be taken to the precinct for questioning.</p>
<p>Using Theft to Create</p>
<h3 id="e155">Large-Scale Iron Factory; A Bizarre and Shocking Theft Case; Secret Construction in Suzhou <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The North American Match Factory on Xichenjiadu Creek, Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, has been in operation for more than ten years since its establishment. The factory site occupies a vast area, and its capital is quite substantial. The internal layout and scale are also very grand and complete. The manager is an American named Blanc, and there are a total of four to five hundred workers. Unexpectedly, the factory recently experienced an unprecedented theft of a large quantity of important machinery, which was secretly transported to Suzhou to rebuild another factory. The details of the incident are recorded below. It turns out that Wang Jisong, a foreman at the factory, secretly contacted Wang Liangyu, a former foreman who had stopped working, and starting this year, continuously stole important machinery and large and small steel knives from the factory and transported them to Suzhou to imitate and build another factory. The factory building has been completed, and the machinery has also been installed. In early last month, Wang and others began raising capital and were in the process of recruiting when, unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by Blanc, the factory manager, who immediately began investigating. As expected, he discovered that many important machines were missing and also found a letter outlining all the plans for stealing and building the factory. The planned steps were to steal the machinery and transport it to Suzhou to imitate and build a factory as the first step, to complete the factory site and raise capital as the second step, to have all the original factory workers go on strike at a specific time and then transport them to Suzhou to start working as the third step. With conclusive evidence, Manager Blanc reported to the Sixth District on the 18th of last month. After receiving the report, District Chief Tan, considering the seriousness of the case, immediately sent Officer Wei to lead the police to the factory and arrested the five thieves, Wang Jisong, Gu Xishan, Lu Afu, Lu Ayou, and Su Asan. After separate interrogations by the criminal officers of the district, they confessed to stealing machinery and building a factory called Tianyuan Iron Factory outside the Changmen Gate of Suzhou. After obtaining the confession, the district officers immediately prepared a document and transferred it to the General Bureau for investigation. Meanwhile, District Chief Tan ordered Detective Team Leader Wu Kezhong to supervise detectives Cao Chu, Yang Qing, and others to accompany Blanc to Suzhou to locate the factory and arrest the thieves Wang Liangyu and Chao Bingrong. They confiscated twenty pieces of stolen goods, including large and small important machines, fifty-two large and small steel knives, seals, letters, and other evidence, and escorted them back to Shanghai early yesterday morning, detaining them in the Sixth District. They then prepared a document and transferred it to the General Bureau for joint investigation.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday was the sixtieth birthday of Mr. Lu Bohong, a philanthropist in this city. Prior to this, his relatives and friends planned to organize birthday celebrations, but Mr. Lu, considering the current national crisis, did not want to make a show of it. Therefore, Wang Yiting and others suggested that the birthday funds be used to support the construction of the Zhabei Muxin Hospital. Mr. Lu agreed and hosted a banquet at the auditorium of Zhengxiu Middle School on Guohuo Road to entertain the guests. At 6:00 PM, the Catholic Bishop of Shanghai, Father Haouisée, performed a thanksgiving Mass and offered blessings. The grand occasion is described in detail below.</p>

<p>During the banquet, Mayor Wu Tiecheng stood up to give a speech, which stated in brief: "Today is the sixtieth birthday of Mr. Lu Bohong of Shanghai. I and everyone here are very happy to participate in this event. Mr. Lu's industries and various charitable causes in this city are well known. This time, he plans to establish the Muxin Hospital in Zhabei to benefit the residents of Zhabei. I and everyone here should congratulate Mr. Lu even more. Today, the Pope of Rome has sent a telegram of congratulations and Bishop Haouisée has offered blessings, which is not only an honor for Mr. Lu but also an honor for the citizens of Shanghai. Mr. Lu's undertakings are always based on the spirit of 'the greatest joy comes from doing good.' Therefore, Mr. Lu is happy in body and mind and in good health. At the age of sixty, he looks like he is in his forties. The reason why Mr. Lu enjoys doing various charitable causes is to follow the spirit of Jesus's universal love and embrace the purpose of saving the world and helping people. His established institutions, such as the Xin Puyu Hall and the Sacred Heart Hospital, have excellent results, which are known to all citizens. Recently, there has been the planning of the Pushan Sanatorium and the establishment of the Muxin Hospital. One charitable cause is completed, and another follows. His spirit of never giving up and his perseverance in moving forward are all derived from his faith in God. We congratulate Mr. Lu on the success of his undertakings and even more congratulate Mr. Lu on becoming healthier as he does charitable causes. I, Tiecheng, respectfully offer a toast and, on behalf of the citizens of this city, wish Mr. Lu a long life and thank him on behalf of the residents of Zhabei."</p>

<p>Following this, Bishop Haouisée gave a speech, stating in brief: "I am here to perform the Holy Communion blessing ceremony to express gratitude to God for bestowing various graces upon Mr. Lu. All of Mr. Lu's undertakings are bestowed by God and cannot be achieved by human power alone. However, the graces bestowed by God are available to everyone, but those who receive the graces must use them well; then, everything they do will be good. If they do not use them well, they will surely fail. Mr. Lu is one who uses his graces well, so none of his undertakings fail, and none are not good. Moreover, Mr. Lu is selfless and impartial in everything he does. Whether they are poor or in trouble, those who ask Mr. Lu for help are always given assistance. The success of the various charitable causes he has undertaken today is due to God's protection. This is the secret to Mr. Lu's success in everything he does. Moreover, he seeks cooperation in everything, does not seek personal gain, and is willing to seek happiness for the public. Therefore, he has gained the trust of people from all walks of life. As a result, he has repeatedly received awards from the Pope. This time, he has even received a blessing by telegram. Cardinal Costantini, the Apostolic Delegate to China, and others have also sent telegrams of congratulations."</p>
<h3 id="e161">Mr. Lu's Reply <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Mr. Lu gave a reply, saying, "Today is Bohong's sixtieth birthday, and I am honored to receive the kindness of friends from all walks of life, as well as the Mayor's gracious presence and Bishop Haouisée's blessings and exhortations. I, Bohong, am deeply grateful and apprehensive. I have made very few contributions to the country and society, and my age has only increased in vain. How can I dare to speak of longevity? However, the various industrial companies that I, Bohong, am responsible for have received guidance from the Mayor at all times, which has prevented them from failing. The charitable institutions that I have traveled around to raise donations for, such as the Xin Puyu Hall in Nanshi, now care for over two thousand poor and disabled patients. The Sacred Heart Hospital in Yangshupu also has over a hundred patients. The medical clinics in various places provide medical treatment and medicine free of charge. In total, about four to five thousand people are rescued every day. The maintenance of the city government and the generous donations from people from all walks of life are essential. Such a large-scale relief effort cannot be accomplished by one person alone. It is truly due to God's protection that we have today's results. This is what I, Bohong, can be somewhat comforted by. What I would like to inform people from all walks of life is that recently, I have observed that the Zhabei area has thriving factories and shops, a large population, and is gradually recovering to the state before the January 28 Incident. There are not many hospitals that seek health for the public, which has caused me concern. Therefore, I plan to build the Muxin Hospital to benefit the residents of Zhabei. Now that I have received the kindness of everyone and the generous gifts on my humble birthday, I will use them all to fund the construction of the hospital, which is tantamount to asking for donations from all the great philanthropists to accomplish this good deed. In the future, the establishment of the hospital will all be thanks to the gifts of people from all walks of life. The book says, 'The family that accumulates good deeds will surely have blessings to spare.' I only hope that the Mayor, the Bishop, and all the great philanthropists will have much happiness and many plans, and I will bow nine times on behalf of the residents of Zhabei to thank you." The guests did not disperse until about 10:00 PM that evening.</p>

<p>Shops Near Jing'an Temple</p>
<h3 id="e166">Please Widen the Sidewalk: Booths Obstruct Business During the Bathing Buddha Festival; the Municipal Council Widens It from Two to Five Feet <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The 34th District Branch of the Citizens' Federation recently received a joint letter from more than a hundred member stores near Jing'an Temple, stating that during the Jing'an Temple Bathing Buddha Festival, the nearby stalls were crowded, and the sidewalk was only three feet wide, which not only hindered business but also posed a danger. They requested the Federation to send personnel to negotiate with the Municipal Council to widen the sidewalk. After learning about the situation, the Federation immediately appointed Zhang Yichen, Qin Linxian, Cai Jiugao, Feng Guangjia, and others to negotiate. The Municipal Council then sent He Dekui to conduct an on-site survey. Upon reporting back to Superintendent Zhong Si, Zhong immediately dispatched Assistant Mian Shi to instruct the Public Works Department to re-plan and widen the sidewalk by two feet to five feet. However, many store members insisted that a distance of one zhang (approximately 10 feet) was necessary, so the negotiation remained unresolved.</p>

<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News, Zhongtian Zhenyilang, a textile supplies peddler at No. 16, Derun Lane, Xihua Road, and Zhiye Suiwang at No. 62, Labourson Road, incurred dining expenses of 16 yuan at the Linglan Cafe at No. 10, East Qiu Jiang Road, on the first of this month. After they finished eating, they claimed they did not have money on them and requested a one-day delay. By the next day, Zhongtian was unable to raise the funds and made various excuses to evade payment. The cafe owner, Murakami, then accompanied Zhongtian to the Consulate General to request their intervention. However, the consulate was powerless since the men were penniless. It was found that the men were known for their dine-and-dash schemes. On April 30th, they had previously dined and dashed at the Songwu restaurant on Xing Road. The Japanese Consulate Police Department, concerned about the repeated instances of shameless dine-and-dash behavior by Japanese residents in Shanghai, has resolved to thoroughly crack down on such incidents.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Heavy Fog Affected Various Ships</p>
<h3 id="e168">Ships Blocked Outside Wusong Estuary: Only Two Ningbo Ships Arrived; Ningxing Damaged in the Fog <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weather in Shanghai was overcast, and heavy fog occurred both at the Wusong Estuary and in the Yangtze River. Many incoming ships did not arrive in Shanghai. The Ningxing, a Shanghai-Ningbo liner from the Sanbei Shipping Company, collided with a warship in the Huangpu River while entering the port, causing slight damage to the stern. It was repaired that day and departed as scheduled in the afternoon. The situation of ships being blocked by the fog is described in detail below.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Temple Fog Hinders Navigation <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, heavy fog descended on the sea outside the Wusong Estuary. The shipping companies’ liners from the south and north returning to Shanghai included Swire's Hubei from Yingkou, Suzhou from Nanhua, Shiyo’s Haosheng from India, China Merchants' Kunxing from Hong Kong and Guangdong, Xinfeng from Beiyang, Haixiang from Guangzhou, and Gongping from Qingdao. In addition, foreign ships included Great Britain’s Mengtou from Hong Kong, and Ting’s Luoer from Europe from Europe. These ships encountered fog in the ocean outside the Wusong Estuary. Due to the obscured sea routes and poor visibility, they anchored at sea to avoid the danger of running aground or colliding in the heavy fog. Therefore, they were unable to enter the port.</p>
<h3 id="e170">River Ships Not Arriving <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Yangtze River liners of various companies have fixed dates for entering and leaving the port, and these cannot be easily changed. Yesterday, the Yangtze River ships that were supposed to arrive in Shanghai included China Merchants' Jiangshun and Jardine Matheson's Ruihe, as well as several smaller Yangtze River ships. However, due to the extremely heavy fog downstream of the Yangtze River, which persisted throughout the day, the river ships were unable to see anything on the river surface due to the obscured waterways. They had to anchor temporarily and wait for the fog to dissipate before sailing to Shanghai. After anchoring, the ships sounded foghorns as usual as signals to avoid collisions with other ships.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Yongxing Slightly Damaged <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, not a single Yangtze River or sea-going ship arrived in Shanghai, except for the Ningbo liners Xinjingtian and Ningxing, which braved the fog to enter the port. When the Ningxing sailed into Wusong and reached the Huangpu River, the fog had not yet cleared, making it difficult to see clearly on the river surface. As a result, when the Ningxing was entering the Huangpu River, it rubbed against a British ship and a warship of an unspecified country anchored on the river surface while trying to avoid them. The stern of the Ningxing rubbed against the hull of the warship, causing minor damage. It then sailed to the Nanshi pier, where it unloaded cargo and passengers and underwent minor repairs. It departed from Shanghai for Ningbo as scheduled at 5:00 PM. The incident of the collision has been reported to the company, but the damage was minimal.</p>

<p>Ms. Qionghua is the wife of Mr. Sheng Junzu Jiang of Qingpu, the daughter of the late Xiaolian Zhu Gengsun, Mr. Ai Ren, and the niece of the historian Wen Qing. She received family education from a young age and, in her spare time, was fond of calligraphy and painting. Following Mr. Ai Ren's instructions, she studied with his old friend Feng Zidi, and her artistic skills have greatly improved. Her style is refreshing, vigorous, and not overly ornate. Her calligraphy is also graceful and elegant. Now, she is exhibiting her works in the capital, not for the sake of fame, but for appreciation and evaluation. Ms. Qionghua is not driven by material desires, but instead finds solace in her brush and ink. Her integrity and tranquility come from family teachings. Gaining fame through art is not her goal, nor is it the common desire of her peers. The personal exhibition will open on the 12th of this month at the Central Hotel in Nanjing, sponsored by Wang Shengzhi, Mu Ouchu, Ye Yuhu, and Chen Taoyi. The exhibition will last for seven days, and the works are not for sale but can be exchanged through the Trust Company.</p>

<p>The Grand Opening of "Pear Blossoms in a Rainstorm": The Jin Cheng Grand Theater is currently screening the Lianhua Film Company's special production, "Pear Blossoms in a Rainstorm." The audience is overflowing, and the crowds are overwhelming. Yesterday was a Saturday, and more than a thousand people were turned away due to lack of space. The film's success is unprecedented. The female leads are Chen Yanyan and Tan Ying. Chen Yanyan is known for her quiet demeanor, while Tan Ying excels in romantic roles. In this film, they have switched styles, and their performances are equally fitting. The entire film uses pear blossoms in a rainstorm to symbolize the plight of vulnerable women. The pear blossoms are covered in rain, making them pitiful and endearing. The audience cannot help but shed tears of sympathy for the tragic experiences of the characters in the film.

<h3 id="e181">A History of the Revision of the Shen Bao Yearbook <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Shen Bao Yearbook was originally created to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Shen Bao. The work began in July of the 21st year and was completed in April of the following year. After its publication, it received widespread praise, which was beyond the expectations of the colleagues involved. However, in China, due to the difficulty in collecting statistics and the challenge of preparing accurate materials, it was inevitable that there would be errors and omissions in the completion of such a large work within a short period of several months. After the completion of the first editorial work, the colleagues thoroughly reviewed it and felt deeply ashamed. Grateful for the criticisms and corrections from enthusiastic supporters, the colleagues gained a clearer understanding of the shortcomings and the goals for improvement. Mr. Shi Liangcai, the general manager of the Shen Bao, and Mr. Zhang Yunhe, the chief editor, also believed that since the first yearbook was popular throughout the country, the content should be further refined to meet the expectations of readers both at home and abroad. Therefore, a thorough revision was undertaken. The noteworthy aspects of the revision process are:</p>
<p>1.  Collaboration with Experts and Various Sectors: The Shen Bao Yearbook is of a general nature and covers a wide range of areas. To obtain comprehensive materials in each category, it was not sufficient to rely on ordinary solicitation. At the beginning of this revision, special efforts were made to seek the practical cooperation of domestic experts, professionals, institutions, and organizations to complete a more comprehensive general yearbook. Fortunately, various sectors generously provided valuable advice, either by undertaking the drafting of special articles, pointing out key areas for improvement, or providing materials that were not easily obtained. As can be seen from the separately listed "Specially Invited Editors" and "Material Providers" tables, this two-million-word work was the result of the collective wisdom and efforts of scholars and experts throughout the country, and not something that the colleagues involved dared to claim credit for on their own.</p>
<p>2.  Implementation of a Communication Investigation: According to the established rules for editing yearbooks, the principle is to solicit and collect various published statistics. However, the completion of a comprehensive statistic takes a long time, and by the time it is published, those who are not familiar with the actual situation of statistical compilation may find it outdated. During the first edition, considerable effort was made to solicit and collect materials, but there were still those who criticized the materials for being too old. For this revision, a communication investigation was conducted in the areas of "Population," "Agriculture and Forestry," and "Cooperation." The results are as follows: In the population category, data was quickly obtained from the civil affairs departments of more than a dozen provinces and various municipal governments, allowing for the compilation of a "Trial Compilation of National Household Population Table" with reference to population tables in various publications. The total population was 477,353,7335, which is close to the results of Mr. Wang Shida's survey at the Institute of Social Research, suggesting that the investigation was not a complete failure. In the agriculture and forestry category, experts provided important statistics that had not been obtained during the previous solicitation. In the cooperation category, the survey materials were more reliable than the previous ones due to the cooperation association issuing announcements and conducting the investigation. Although the communication investigation did not yield a large amount of data, it cannot be said that there was no progress. Therefore, it is planned to continue this practice in the future to achieve perfection. If various institutions and organizations provide active assistance, allowing for gradual updates, the benefits will extend far beyond the colleagues involved.</p>
<p>After this thorough revision of the Shen Bao Yearbook, the colleagues are not yet ready to definitively say how many parts can be considered to have a solid foundation. However, the experience gained from this revision has made them realize the difficulty of the task. During the revision period, in order to ensure accuracy, the specially invited authors and internal colleagues repeatedly withdrew and revised the drafts that had already been issued. As a result, the amount of material increased compared to the original plan, and the publication was delayed. After the review was completed, there was still a sense that many aspects were not satisfactory. As for the changes to the previously listed categories, the intention was to eliminate unimportant independent sections and merge them into related sections to avoid duplication and facilitate checking. However, whether this is appropriate and whether it will be convenient for reviewing remains to be seen and is subject to the guidance of experts.</p>
<p>Grateful to the enthusiastic teachers who corrected and supplied materials, to those who undertook the writing of the drafts, and to the various institutions and organizations that provided assistance, we hereby express our gratitude. Zhang Zishen, March 4, 5.</p>

<h3 id="e184">The National Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration 23 <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>First Quarter Work Overview (2)</p>
<h3 id="e185">Regulations for Publication of Periodic Reports <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Our bureau's external reports have only included accounting and statistical annual reports, limited to the year and primarily in English. This is detailed in economics but lacking in substance and insufficient to represent the overall business situation of our railway. Another publication each year, "An Overview" and "Quarterly Work Summaries," are also limited to the year and are in Chinese. The style of the "Overview" is mostly tables, while the "Work Summaries" are narrative and can supplement the accounting and statistical annual reports. Therefore, it was decided to make these three types the bureau's annual periodic reports and to formulate publication methods, which were submitted to the bureau's business meeting for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>3. Development and Expansion of Business: Promote business offices, promote combined water, land, and air transportation, sell fourth-class tickets for Weiting to Guandu Li, add temporary inter-city trains, promote spring travel, relax restrictions on the types of mixed-loaded goods in a whole car, reduce freight rates for pigs and grain, extend the storage period for goods at the Maigen Road warehouse, establish regulations for the custody of boats and vehicles, establish a sample display room for goods, and investigate the economic situation along the railway line.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Promoting Business Offices <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Our bureau, adhering to the principle of proactively attracting passenger and freight transportation, first established a business office on Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai in August of last year. This office piloted services such as answering inquiries, selling passenger tickets, and handling luggage. Later, it also began to handle freight transportation. This year, we also established a cooperative arrangement with China Travel Service. All goods or packages shipped to railway stations with business offices by the various branch offices of China Travel Service will be picked up and delivered by our business offices. For locations without business offices, the business offices will act as agents, handling the pick-up, delivery, shipment, loading, unloading, and collection of payments for goods. Since then, business operations have gradually developed, with daily receipts averaging around 1,500 yuan. Answering inquiries also occurs no less than 140-150 times per day, indicating that the office meets the needs of the public. Therefore, on January 1st of this year, we rented a residential building at No. 10, South Outer Ma Road in Shanghai to establish a business branch (later, due to the small size of the premises, we re-rented No. 18 Outer Ma Road and moved in on March 20th). At the same time, we actively prepared for a Nanjing branch, renting No. 372 Taiping Road as the location, which opened on February 10th.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Promoting Combined Water, Land, and Air Transportation <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Combined transportation between railways and other water and land routes not only increases convenience for travelers but is also very beneficial to the railway's own business. Our railway has been steadily progressing in this area in recent years, achieving good results. The Zhejiang Province's Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway originally handled combined passenger and freight transportation with our railway. Since the completion and opening of the Jinyu section at the end of last December, it was proposed to add the Huzhen, Longyou, Anren, Zhangshutan, Quzhou, Jiangshan, Hecun, Yushan, and eight stations to the combined transportation network. Our bureau immediately agreed and implemented this on March 1st of this year. In January, the Yangtze River was shallow, hindering navigation. Following the orders of the Ministry of Railways, we jointly arranged combined Shanghai-Hankou transportation with the Pinghan, Longhai, and Jinpu Railways. Starting from February 5th, daily round-trip services operated between Shanghai North Station and Hankou. The Shanghai-Xuzhou section temporarily utilized the Shanghai-Ping service. Passengers from Shanghai could take the 302 express train at 12:00 every night (changed to 4:05 PM daily starting April 1st) to Xuzhou, then transfer to Hankou via Zhengzhou. As the transportation of parcels between Shanghai and Hankou increased daily, we also discussed opening direct combined parcel service between Shanghai North Station and Dazhimen in Hankou. The Pinghan Railway provided three cars, and the Longhai, Jinpu, and Jinghu Railways each provided two cars, forming a total of nine cars. Each week, three round trips operated between Shanghai and Hankou, attached to the 11th and 12th trains of the Pinghan Railway, the 13th and 14th trains of the Longhai Railway, the 5th and 6th trains of the Jinpu Railway, and the 9th, 22nd, and 24th trains of the Jinghu Railway, directly crossing the river. The Joint Transportation Office of the Ministry of Railways also, in response to the increasing development of combined parcel transportation and to meet the needs of society, submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval and publication of regulations for the payment of combined parcel transportation fees upon arrival. Our railway implemented this starting April. As for the LCL (less-than-carload) freight cars between Shanghai and Xuzhou, we had previously agreed with the Jinpu Railway to send personnel to directly escort the goods. However, due to a lack of escort personnel, this was delayed. We have now selected eight luggage porters from Shanghai North Station for training and have agreed with the Jinpu Railway to implement the combined transportation method starting April 1st. In addition, regarding the Jinghu Railway, in addition to adding the Dahongqiao stop to the combined Qingyanggang-Hupu ferry service, we have been handling combined passenger, luggage, and parcel transportation with long-distance buses from Zhenjiang to Yangzhou since January 21st, and with long-distance buses from Zhenjiang via Danyang to Jintan since March 1st. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway also started handling combined passenger transportation with the Sanqingji steamboat, which operates from Zhouzhuang in Wujiang County via Lili and Luxu to Jiashan, starting March 1st. Our bureau believes that this cooperative method is beneficial to all parties and is considering extending it to air transportation, planning to hold separate combined transportation events with China and Eurasia Airlines in order to create a national water, land, and air transportation network, which is currently under negotiation.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Selling Fourth-Class Tickets from Weiting to Guandu Li <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The Jinghu Railway began selling fourth-class tickets from Weiting to Suzhou in June of last year. Based on observations over the past six months, most of these passengers were Weiting weavers traveling between Weiting and Guandu Li, with very few going to Suzhou. Therefore, we changed to selling fourth-class tickets from Weiting to Guandu Li, tentatively priced at one dime to assist the common people. At the same time, we canceled the fourth-class tickets from Weiting to Suzhou to avoid unnecessary losses.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Adding Temporary Inter-city Trains <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>In the early part of this quarter, during the winter season, there were particularly many passengers, especially those taking the Jinghu Line via Zhenjiang to Jiangbei. Therefore, starting February 8th, we temporarily added a Shanghai-Wuxi inter-city train, departing at 2:50 AM, with ten third- and fourth-class cars, so that passengers between Wuxi and Shanghai would not be crowded on the Shanghai-Zhenjiang train. At the same time, we added cars to the Shanghai-Wuxi third- and fourth-class inter-city train departing at 5:00 AM and attached it to the Yangzhou-Wuxi-Nanjing inter-city train after arriving in Wuxi to facilitate traffic.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Promoting Spring Travel <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>As winter ended and spring returned, with pleasant scenery, the areas along our railway, such as Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, were all famous scenic spots in Jiangnan. Every year, travel to these places is very popular. Therefore, we formulated methods to promote travel, such as arranging accommodations and transportation, and published promotional brochures to encourage interest. We also selected capable staff to handle recruitment and guidance, increasing convenience. We also stipulated that starting March 30th, special tour trains to Hangzhou would run for five days, with one extra round-trip express train between Shanghai North Station and Hangzhou each day to facilitate travel.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Continuing to Relax Restrictions on the Types of Mixed-Loaded Goods in a Whole Car <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Railway freight transportation regulations stipulate that a maximum of five different types of goods can be mixed in one car. However, our railway's average proportion of transported goods is mostly foreign general merchandise. Passengers mostly ship mixed items. This was clarified to the Ministry of Railways last year, and approval was granted to relax the restrictions on the types of goods in a whole car to ten on our railway. This was piloted for six months starting July 1st. After implementation, both the railway and merchants found it convenient. Therefore, before the expiration date, we submitted an application for approval to continue for another six months, starting January 1st of this year. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you concerning the news item in your newspaper's local news column on May 5th, regarding a large shipment of Taiwanese longan, which stated, "Our company recently sent people to Taiwan to purchase a large quantity of longan and dried longan, and it is rumored that more than a thousand pieces will arrive soon." This information is inaccurate. Our company is merely an agent that buys and sells goods on behalf of customers, earning commission. We have never sent anyone to purchase goods from various locations. Although fifteen pieces of dried longan and twelve pieces of dried meat were shipped to us in April, these were sent by the cargo owner without our company's prior consent and entrusted to us for exchange. We have already informed the sender of our position, requesting that they transfer the goods to another company or have them shipped back. We have not yet received a reply. The statement in the report that our company sent people to Taiwan to purchase the goods is completely unfounded. As for the claim that a large shipment of Taiwanese goods will arrive soon, this is even more groundless and based on pure conjecture. We are concerned that the public will be misled by this false information. Therefore, we are writing to request that you publish this letter in your letters to the editor column and issue a correction. We would be most grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e192">Q&amp;A on Reading – Doubts after Reading "Source Material on the History of the New Chinese Literature Movement" (Continued II) – Reply to Mr. Wang Renkan – <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The growth of a new kind of literature depends on the substance of a prosperous class life. Let us look at those neutral figures who linger in the "Palace of Art," how they support the facade of their literature on their shallow and soft life foundation! They either completely Europeanize, using the pleasure of the expiration period of capitalism as the content of their literary works, or they fall into metaphysics. Here, we can cite several works as examples. Bing Xin's "Stars" and "Letters to Young Readers" were widely circulated at the time, but when we further examine them, what else do these things express besides the so-called superficial individualistic love? Liu Dabai's "Old Dreams" can be said to be a variant of the Mao Poetry, full of metaphysical tones in content. Others, such as Wang Jingzhi's "The Wind of Hui" and Yu Pingbo's "Winter Night," are all spinning around in such a small world. As for Xu Zhimo, he is merely "integrating their great achievements." According to the general historical process of literary development, the initial stage of the emergence of a new kind of literature should be aggressive and revolutionary; it should be content over form. However, the literature of China's emerging bourgeoisie has taken the completely opposite form. What does this show? This shows that the national bourgeoisie, as soon as it raises its head, embarks on a path of collapse, losing its fighting power and unable to enrich the content of its class life. Therefore, in literature, the general intellectuals only pick up the dregs of the life of the European and American bourgeoisie in the period of decline. They can only use tricks of form to embellish their own superficiality. Even in the use of language, what they have achieved, besides Europeanized sentences, is new-style classical Chinese, because the completion of a language movement is also subject to great limitations of social conditions.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we should especially remind the reader that, in the process of our new literary movement, when we are completely disappointed with the upper-class intellectuals of the national bourgeoisie, when we examine that although the "May Fourth Movement" launched a new literary movement, it did not complete any tasks in the literary movement, do we think that the new literary movement has stopped its operation? No, we must pay attention to one thing! The "May Fourth Movement" has enabled the new literary movement to penetrate into the petty-bourgeois student and small-citizen strata, then, inevitably, this broader group will rise up to demand their own literature. At a certain period, they were more active than the upper-class bourgeois intellectuals. Although they are the easiest to waver, they stand in the middle from the bourgeoisie to the masses. They can easily see the powerlessness of the bourgeoisie, and at the same time, they can easily discover the undercurrents among the lower masses. Therefore, when the bourgeois intellectuals have lost their power in the literary movement, and the lower masses have not yet reached the maturity to bear this responsibility, the petty bourgeoisie just happens to be the bridge of this transitional era. While denying the achievements of bourgeois intellectuals in the new literary movement, we should also recognize the various groups representing the petty bourgeoisie who supported this movement after "May Fourth." Then, we cannot but fall on the Zhou brothers, the Creation Society and the Literary Research Society.</p>
<p>On the whole, they—these advanced representatives of the petty bourgeoisie—gave this new literary movement a specific content. They put forward the slogan "Art for Life," which seems nothing special at present, but at that time, for those feudal literati who were artists for "fame" or for "interest," for those bourgeois literati who were breaking ranks for art, we cannot ignore its practical combat meaning. In terms of creation, some progressive things have also been produced. First of all, we should mention the unforgettable Lu Xun, whose works, from "Diary of a Madman" to "The True Story of Ah Q," are full of active anti-feudal significance. Secondly, Guo Moruo's poems and his "Three Rebellious Women," both in content and form, are also brand-new works, works with new life. If we want to raise the issue of accepting literary heritage, only these little bits of heritage are worth accepting.</p>
<p>Then, on this unified single line, why are so many different barriers formed? Why did the Literary Research Society and the Creation Society stand against each other at this time? Obviously, this is because of the imbalance of social development and the defects of their class itself, which are reflected in literature, so that various stages of literary thought that have undergone a long period of development in Europe appear in China in a complex and simultaneous manner. When we recognize this problem, we must not think that this is a bad phenomenon. We must not be afraid of struggle. Their struggle is no longer a matter of form like the debate on vernacular literature, but a more practical matter of content. To be sure, the Literary Research Society is conservative and tends to naturalism, and the Creation Society is progressive and tends to romanticism. But our understanding should be limited to this point, and we should not further defend anyone. Their struggle has a considerable effect in promoting the growth of another stage of the new literary movement; at the same time, they are all limited by their own stage, but no one has the courage to enter that new stage. When society progresses rapidly, after the waves of the "February 8th," "May 30th," and even the great revolution of 1925-1927, when the lower masses rise up to demand their own literature and consciously take on the task of this new literary movement, even the Creation Society, which was the first to put forward the call for "revolutionary literature," has changed its face from the previous Creation Society.

<p>Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement: The opening ceremony of the Games was held at the City No. 1 Sports Field. The party and national flags were crossed outside the gate, and a white cloth banner with the words "The First Shanghai Workers Games of the Shanghai General Labor Union" was hung above it. The platform was set up in the north of the field, with a portrait of the Prime Minister in the center. The party and national flags were placed on both sides of the portrait. The front of the platform was filled with more than one hundred prizes donated by government officials, various agencies, and various sectors. They were dazzling and beautiful. The venue was also equipped with a generator for making reports. The order of the entire venue was maintained by members of the military training class of various labor unions, as well as more than one hundred boy scouts from Junyi, Shangzhong, Shixiao, and Post Office workers. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau dispatched inspectors and detectives to assist. The post office workers' military band played music, and the order was quite orderly and solemn.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Zhu Xuefan said in his opening speech, "Representatives of Party and government agencies, guests from all walks of life, and all the athletic heroes of the Workers Games, today is the opening of the First Shanghai Workers Games. I am grateful for the guidance of the representatives of the higher-level agencies and guests from all walks of life, and for the enthusiastic participation of workers' organizations and male and female workers throughout Shanghai. Although the Workers Games in Shanghai, or perhaps in China, this Games is still an unprecedented initiative every time. However, seeing the full spirit and tense atmosphere in today's Games, we can prove that the bright future of the Chinese labor movement will be opened vigorously after the opening of the Games. Then, how worthy is today's Games for us to celebrate! At the same time, we are grateful to the higher-level agencies and fellow countrymen from all walks of life who have guided us and helped us to hold this Games."</p>
<h3 id="e202">Mayor Wu's Address (Photo by Xu Tianzhang) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Workers' Union First All...The intention should be how grateful ah! Revolutionary workers participating in the conference, when holding the conference here, we must understand that the revival of the Chinese revolutionary movement, the salvation of China's difficulties, and the success of the Chinese revolutionary movement are all urgently awaiting our revolutionary workers to work together. This conference is a review of our revolutionary forces, and it is also the beginning of our responsibilities. The strong men participating in the conference today will be the worker soldiers standing on the front line of the revolution in the future. Therefore, I believe that the significance and mission of this Shanghai Municipal Workers' Movement Conference are beyond the significance of general sports meets, and it has a more significant meaning and a more difficult task. China's social and economic class is transitioning from an agricultural and handicraft economy to an industrial and scientific arena. People living in an agricultural and handicraft economic society have a slow, scattered, unstrict, and unregulated life. Therefore, others often scold us Chinese as a pile of loose sand. We examine ourselves and we are indeed like a plate of loose sand. How can we survive in this world surrounded by organized and tense powerful countries? Moreover, due to the objective environment, we know that various reactionary forces are hindering us. China's national revolution and economic construction have not yet been completed. It is because of this uncompleted and abnormal situation that the economic life of the people is becoming increasingly depressed and difficult, the people's situation is becoming increasingly passive and pessimistic, and social morality is becoming increasingly corrupt and declining. Only cruel and ruthless competition for private interests is seen between society and individuals. Other active and just activities are nowhere to be seen. Due to the objective environmental reasons mentioned above and the abnormal subjective weaknesses, our group life and mass life are affected. It can be said that the lives of ordinary people have very little discipline and are extremely unstrict, resulting in the lack of energy in the national spirit and the lack of tension in revolutionary emotions. We can know these facts as long as we think about them and take a look at them. Let's not talk about the facts of aggression and oppression that the imperialists have imposed on us in the past. Now, let's just talk about the cruel bloody lessons that the Japanese imperialists have given us since the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, and the Battle of Rehe. The Japanese imperialists destroyed our prosperous Southeast market and completely occupied our Northeast Four Provinces. They also used warships and airplanes to intimidate our coastal areas and vainly attempted to create puppet forces in the North China provinces. As long as they can create chaos in China and oppose the central government, the Japanese imperialists do not hesitate to provide huge amounts of money and weapons to fund their activities. In North China, the Japanese imperialists disregarded treaty constraints and acted recklessly, which has become a very open fact. Compatriots, in fact, we are already complete slaves of a fallen nation. Are we still waiting to be ghosts of a fallen nation? "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!" Today, we only have to prepare to shed blood and shed the last drop of blood. This is our plan to save the country, our aspiration to save the country, our plan for revolution, and our aspiration for revolution. However, preparing to shed blood is not easy to do, and it requires technology. The first step is to transform the revolutionary environment. We must create a large number of revolutionary fighters to enrich the foundation of the revolution. The second step is to organize ourselves and train ourselves so that we know how to go and fight desperately, instead of being slaughtered and treated as food. That is to say, we must know how to value every drop of our own blood, instead of letting others suck it without any resistance. Compatriots, a nation of loose sand, a corrupt and weak nation that only knows how to covet private interests, they do not know how to love and cherish their own blood and let it flow to the glorious road. We must bear the mission of revolution, we must have subjective cultivation conditions and personal fighting skills, and to go a step further, we must sweep away the weakness, looseness, corruption, stubbornness, indiscipline, disregard for order, and all aspects of life that are not suitable for today's world stage of life and struggle, and make our actions organized and disciplined, and our spirit solemn and active. For the specific methods of cultivation and training required for this, it is what Chairman Chiang recently announced, "to militarize the national life of the whole country." We must use the spirit and methods of militarization to change and save the weaknesses in our previous lives and make ourselves a team that is brave, knowledgeable, able to speak, and able to act. The significance of this first Shanghai Municipal Workers' Movement Conference, I believe, is not the significance of a general sports meet, but that the working masses of Shanghai will start to eliminate the weaknesses in the national life of the past, follow the announcement of the supreme leader, rectify themselves, train themselves, and embark on the leading position of the revolution. The establishment of new moral standards and the cultivation of new forces of the Chinese nation can all be recognized from this sports meet.</p>
<p>Preparation Report: Li Mengnan, Director of the Conference Preparation Committee, reported on the preparation process, saying briefly that today, the first Workers' Games are held here at the opening ceremony, preparing to use sports to train the body and revive the Chinese nation. Regarding the preparation process of this conference, it is divided into three steps. The first step is to propagate to various factories after the resolution of the General Labor Union's full committee meeting. The second step is to actively do internal work, such as soliciting prizes. The third step is to plan the order of sports, the venue, hire instructors, etc. Thanks to the help and guidance of Mr. Ling Xitao and Mr. Xu Duo, I would like to express my gratitude.</p>
<p>Mayor's Address: Mayor Wu Tiecheng gave an address, saying briefly that today is the opening of the city's first Workers' Movement Conference. We see the spirit of all the athletes, and we have infinite hope for the future of the country and the nation. We must know that workers occupy an important place in the organization of a modern country. Since workers bear a great responsibility for organizing a modern country, increasing production and enriching national strength are mostly on the workers. Of course, only when workers are organized, disciplined, and have a national system can they bear great responsibilities. This workers' physical exercise movement is to train workers' physique, so that workers have a group, have organization, and have discipline, so that they can generate strength, and only with strength can they enrich national strength and increase national production. Today, seeing the Workers' Games, there is already a new spirit full of hope for the revival of the Chinese nation. This hope really started from the Workers' Games. Wu Xingya's speech: Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Bureau, gave a speech, saying, "Today is May 5th, the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's establishment of the revolutionary government in Guangdong and his assumption of the post of Extraordinary President. It occupies a very important page in the history of the revolution. In the memorial meeting, holding the city's Workers' Games fully shows that most of the workers are revolutionary elements. Standing in this windy and rainy situation, we should take on the work of national revival to show that we have training, organization, and fighting power. At the same time, all our Shanghai workers who participate in the games should take on the responsibility to lead all Shanghai workers to break open a bloody path and revive the Chinese nation. At the same time, under the invasion of imperialism, we should cheer up and fight."</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan's Speech: Tao Baichuan, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, gave a speech, saying, "Brothers, today I represent the Municipal Party Department to participate in the first Shanghai Municipal Workers' Movement Conference, and I feel very honored, because the Municipal Party Department has participated in thousands of workers' gatherings, but has never participated in the Workers' Movement Conference. This is the first time the Municipal Party Department has participated, and I feel very honored. Regarding the past Workers' Games, only a few students or a few schools have shown some of their achievements. After this Workers' Movement Conference is held, it can be popularized to the general public. This significance is already worth commemorating. Moreover, in addition to the general athletes, there are hundreds of military training classes participating, so that ordinary workers have a group, discipline, organization, and morality. The success of the workers' movement is popularized to the people, and military training is used to perform sports, which is even more worth commemorating. Today, the ceremony is held in the wind and rain. I hope everyone will remember this in their hearts, because now China is also in the wind and rain. Our enemy, Japan, not only took our Northeast Four Provinces and regarded them as their territory, but also madly does not regard China as an independent country. We are not afraid of the wind and rain and hold a meeting here. We must not be afraid of enemies like storms and rain to unite the Republic of China and revive the Chinese nation. The meaning of our sports is to save the country. We hope that you will recognize this clearly." Pan Gongzhan's Speech: Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, gave a speech, saying, "Today we are here to participate in the first Workers' Movement Conference, and we have a great feeling. We believe in the power of the workers, based on discipline, and practice and cultivate from the root, we will definitely have considerable success in reviving the Chinese nation, and this is also the key to success. I not only hope that the workers' movement will be expanded, but also hope that it will be popularized to other sectors, so that everyone will stand up and exercise in the future, forge a strong physique, and retaliate against the enemy's bullying."</p>
<p>Wu Kaixian's Speech: Legislative Yuan member Wu Kaixian gave a speech, saying, "Comrades, today the opening of the first Shanghai Workers' Games is a demonstration of the national spirit, which is a way to save the country. Shanghai workers are also determined to take on the responsibility of reviving the nation and the responsibility of overthrowing Japanese imperialism. How to take on this responsibility? The first step is to train the body. Today is a review of the workers' physique, but it does not mean that it is over after the sports meeting. We should continue to work hard to be effective. Now we know that you are determined and trained. In the future, we should do the work of awakening the nation and strive and sacrifice for the Party and the country and the nation at any time and anywhere."</p>
<p>Lu Jingshi's Speech: Lu Jingshi, a member of the Municipal Party Department, said, "Today, the grand ceremony of the first Workers' Movement Conference of the General Labor Union is held here. Regarding the significance of the workers' movement, everyone has explained it in detail just now. What we should pay attention to is to train our physique to do the work of saving the country, because the past work of saving the country was not practical and was a temporary emotional impulse. Now we must be down-to-earth and use guns to attack the enemy. I hope that all workers will receive military training and become pioneers in saving the Party and the country in the future. Don't just sing high-sounding tunes like before. This Workers' Movement Conference is the preliminary step for receiving military training and doing practical work to save the country in the future. I hope that all workers will pay attention." Ma Shaoquan, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Ren Jinpin, a guest, also gave speeches.</p>

<p>Jiangxi Provincial Games</p>
<h3 id="e206">Chairman Chiang's Own Inscription <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Education Department held the Jiangxi Provincial Games on May 3rd in Nanchang. Chairman Chiang wrote an inscription in his own handwriting, and specially marked the two sentences "Forge a sound physique to undertake career" and "Abide by the rules of sports to cultivate morality" to indicate the direction of physical education. The inscription is recorded and reproduced on the left:</p>
<p>Jiangxi Provincial Games Inscription: Forge a sound physique to undertake career; Abide by the rules of sports to cultivate morality. Therefore, the purpose of our advocacy of physical education is to make the general youth of the whole country have a universal development of the above two, and make unremitting efforts to make each individual's physique strong and make each individual's life and group life all enter the discipline and militarization, so as to achieve the responsibility of the whole nation. The meaning is extremely profound and important, and it is by no means just: creating a few special experts to temporarily prop up the facade. I deeply hope that the students of this Jiangxi Provincial Games will carefully study this, and not treat it as a flash in the pan, or regard it as a game, but persevere and strive to complete the mission of physical education, so as to live up to the high expectations.</p>

<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>In a certain mountain, there lived a mother rabbit and two baby rabbits. The mother rabbit went to the forest alone to find something good to eat for the baby rabbits. Unexpectedly, she fell into a stone cave. The stone cave was five or six feet deep, and she couldn't climb out. The mother rabbit wept incessantly in the cave. After a while, a deer passed by the cave. The mother rabbit cried out for help. The deer looked at the deep stone cave and, seeing no way to help, raised its head and went its way. At this time, the two baby rabbits were very anxious because their mother had not returned for a long time. They left their burrow and went everywhere to look for her. Later, they walked to the side of the stone cave and heard their mother's mournful voice. They ran around the edge of the stone cave, frantic. The mother rabbit hurriedly said, "Now that you've arrived here and seen me trapped in this pit, you should think of a way to save me!" Although the two baby rabbits both wanted to save their mother, they saw that the stone cave was very deep and could only cry in despair.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a beam of moonlight appeared at the cave entrance. A woman descended and said, "Please save my mother, and I will never forget your great kindness. The woman said, "It's easy for me to save your mother's life, but I want the fur of you two." The baby rabbits thought, "I want to make clothes and hats." At this time, the two baby rabbits, seeing that their mother's life was in danger, couldn't care about their own bodies and agreed, "We can't sit by and watch our mother die in the stone cave. If you save our mother's life, we are willing to have our skin and fur stripped off, even if it means being crushed to powder." The woman heard this and immediately jumped into the stone cave and rescued the mother rabbit. She said, "I really don't want your fur. Your filial piety has moved me very much. You don't need to say much; just go back and be with your mother." After speaking, the woman disappeared.</p>
<p>Because they were grateful to the woman who appeared in the moonlight, from then on, every year on the night of the fifteenth day of the month, they invited a group of rabbits, mashed rice to make rice cakes, and offered them to the woman in the moon.</p>

<h3 id="e217">League of Nations' Prostitution Prohibition Issue <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Tong Hua</p>
<p>The Advisory Committee on Protection of Women and Children of the League of Nations dispatched a fact-finding mission to the Far East last year. As a result, a report was produced, describing the situation of trafficking in women in the Orient. The report listed the countries with the most trafficking in women, with China being first, followed by Japan, then Korea, Malaysia, Annam, Siam, the Philippines, etc., with fewer cases. Trafficking in women also occurred in Asia Minor and the Near East. This trafficking mainly involved selling the victims into prostitution. The fact-finding mission proposed seven methods to prevent trafficking in women in various parts of the Far East. The main points were to abolish the issuance of licenses or publicly recognized brothels, paying special attention to Hong Kong and Shanghai; establishing a general anti-trafficking agency for women, strictly enforcing imprisonment, and closely cooperating with Geneva to exchange information.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Kuomin News Agency on the 11th of last month, the League of Nations also resolved to ban all brothels worldwide, in order to prevent the trafficking of women from recurring. The method was to notify the authorities of various countries not to issue licenses, so that the prostitution industry would lose its legal protection. After the prohibition of prostitution, each prostitute would be given a proper occupation, so that they could become good citizens.</p>
<p>This resolution of the League of Nations is a slight step forward compared to the proposal of last year's Far East Women's Fact-Finding Mission. Although both take the non-issuance of licenses as the first measure to prohibit prostitution, the former noted that "if, after the prohibition of prostitution, each prostitute can be given a proper occupation, then it will not be difficult for them to become good citizens." However, under these two measures of the League of Nations, whether the trafficking of women and the prostitution system can be eliminated immediately following this official document is highly debatable.</p>
<p>Prostitution cannot be eliminated by simply making prostitution less public. Although public prostitution is abolished, private prostitution will inevitably flourish as a result. If private prostitution flourishes, then the trafficking of women will inevitably continue. Why are some people willing to become private prostitutes? Why are some people willing to sell their wives and daughters? These are things that the gentlemen on the shores of Lake Geneva do not understand. Therefore, the methods they decide are naturally bound to be superficial. Now, let me talk about its reasons!</p>
<p>The production of the current system is the reproduction of surplus value. Under this production system, the accumulation of wealth is accompanied by the accumulation of poverty. On the one hand, there are a few extremely happy and idle people; on the other hand, there are many laborers who cannot marry in time, and women who have lost their means of living, are unemployed or without work. In this situation, there are people who enjoy pleasure, people who satisfy sexual desires, and people who are forced to exchange sex for a living. The contradictions of sexual morality, coupled with the contradictions of the economic system, inevitably lead to the existence of the prostitution system, and the trafficking of women into prostitution inevitably occurs. Bebel said, "Marriage is the sexuality of the bourgeois world," and on the other hand, it is prostitution. Marriage is the front of the shield, and prostitution is the back of the shield. Male society cannot be satisfied in marriage, so it usually goes to prostitutes to seek compensation." Therefore, "prostitution is a necessary institution of bourgeois society."</p>
<p>The cruel facts of the Western European bourgeoisie plundering backward nations can be evidenced by the example cited in Luxembourg's Introduction to Economics:</p>
<p>"Due to the lack of food and the sadness of separation from their children, most of the imprisoned natives died on the way to Keemali Port. Among the slaves, those who could not keep up with their companions due to fatigue were stabbed in the back with daggers by the Spaniards, who thought that they would be a threat if left behind, and were cruelly abused. These unfortunate creatures, completely naked, tired and injured, and almost unable to stand due to hunger, the sight of this tragedy was heart-rending. Their hands and feet were bound with iron chains. Not one of the young girls escaped the violence of these robbers (the Spaniards), who indulged in their lewdness and sacrificed them. As a result, most of the young girls had contracted venereal diseases and become permanently crippled... Once the natives became slaves, they were branded with a red-hot iron to mark them. Sometimes, part of the slaves were plundered by the captain and distributed among the soldiers. The soldiers used them as gambling items or sold them to Spanish immigrants. Merchants used them as commodities, exchanging them for wine, flour, sugar, and other daily necessities, and sent them to the parts of the Spanish colonies that needed slaves the most. During transportation, merchants confined the slaves to the bottom of the ship, without giving them seats, fresh air, or water, causing them to die."</p>
<p>This kind of inhumane robbery, although not present on the surface now, has not actually disappeared. The Far East Women's Fact-Finding Mission's claim that China is the country with the most trafficking in women is a good example. International imperialism, in order to maintain China's backwardness, on the one hand, maintains feudal forces, and on the other hand, carries out economic aggression. Especially since this global panic, the dumping of discounted goods by various countries has further accelerated the collapse of China's national economy. In rural areas, due to heavy exploitation, aquatic plants, leaves, wheat seedlings, and tree bark have become the peasants' wonderful foods to fill their stomachs, and selling their children has become their method of drinking poison to quench their thirst. "In Shaanxi, ten-year-old orphaned girls are sold for one or two silver dollars, but there are few buyers. In the Quanzhou area of Zhejiang, an eight-year-old girl sells for only twenty-two yuan, including the broker's fee, and a ten-year-old sells for only fifty yuan." In urban areas, the nascent industries are not immune to the blow of imperialism. The closure of silk mills, yarn mills, rubber factories, and match factories has left a large number of unemployed female workers with nowhere to go. In Shunde, Guangdong, the decline of the silk industry has led to more than 200,000 female workers wandering in Guangzhou,</p>
<p>living as maids or secretly engaging in prostitution, which is an example. "Even for women who can be employed in industry, commerce, or households, their wages are not high, and cannot be used to maintain a family's life. Thus, when the burden of life is too heavy, far exceeding what their meager wages can provide, their only way to cope with the difficulty is prostitution, in order to supplement their income." In this situation, there are a large number of women engaging in prostitution in various parts of China. In terms of the number of public and private prostitutes, there are more than 60,000 to 100,000 in Shanghai alone. In Nanjing, there are more than 3,000 private prostitutes. In Beiping, there are more than 2,000 public prostitutes. In Hankou, there are 1,735 public prostitutes, and the number of private prostitutes in these two places is several times that of public prostitutes, which is not included in the calculation. As for cities with around 1,000 public and private prostitutes, they are too numerous to count. How did this phenomenon occur? Isn't it caused by imperialism and feudal forces?</p>
<p>The contradictory social organization inevitably produces this dark phenomenon. With the premise of this contradictory social system, it is inevitable that there is no way to solve the problem. How can a piece of paper abolish trafficking in people? How can it abolish the prostitution system? In terms of the so-called post-event solutions, the more than 30 million unemployed workers and the tens of millions of hungry and cold people have already overwhelmed all capitalist countries. How can they find solutions for those women who have already fallen into the pit of fire? Hitler in Germany has already adopted the method of returning women from occupations to the family to solve the unemployment problem of male workers. How can he find proper occupations for prostitutes who live by prostitution? Therefore, the second method is also a dishonored check. Based on the above, this resolution of the League of Nations is just an empty theory that does not help the facts.</p>
<h3 id="e218">World's Great Thinkers' Opinions on Women's Issues (5) <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>5. Schopenhauer</p>
<p>Arthur Schopenhauer was a German idealist philosopher and a pessimist. He was born in 1788 and died in 1860. The several British and French thinkers we discussed earlier were ardent advocates of women's equality, but Schopenhauer was an extremely abusive critic of women. His "On Women" (translated by Zhang Weici, Shenzhou Publishing) scolds women as worse than chickens and dogs. First, let's talk about his points against women's liberation, and then explore the reasons for his reactionary thoughts.</p>
<p>First, he fundamentally looked down on women, believing that women were not worthy of doing great things. He said, "You only need to look at the shape of women,</p>
<h3 id="e219">New Sorrow, Azure Distance <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>When women speak of the word "sorrow," people invariably think of Lin Daiyu, a beauty who is both talented and sickly, but that is not the point.</p>
<p>Just now, the landlord upstairs was scolding the nanny with authority, scolding her for sneaking out all day and not cooking. He was a cadre during the "May Eighth" Beijing student movement. How could he, on the anniversary of his glorious history, be alone in his room, starving? Anyone would feel anger rising from within.</p>
<p>The nanny was also a very capable nanny. She did not retreat at all in reason. Just listen to the back-and-forth arguments between the master and servant:</p>
<p>"You must have gone to that Wang Mazi's place again, you bastard!"</p>
<p>"Sir! If I could earn three more yuan a month here, I wouldn't go."</p>
<p>"Your conscience is so black! Other people's nannies get four yuan a month, and I've already paid that amount. You want me to pay seven yuan!"</p>
<p>"I didn't say I wanted you to pay seven yuan a month, but if I'm short three yuan and can't find a way, I'll naturally have to run out. Two boys at home, living with other people, cost six yuan a month. The remaining one yuan, I have to save in case I have another son. If it's a girl, it's fine to just kill her."</p>
<p>Hearing this, the landlord was stunned for a moment. But after a moment, another kind of frustrated hero's anger welled up in him. He said:</p>
<p>"Even if you're going to do bad things, you shouldn't not come back to cook! And you're really shameless, actually admitting to going to Wang Mazi's place! The Four-Horse Road prostitutes, sometimes if you pinch their face, they'll still say "I'm embarrassed," but you're even less afraid of embarrassment than them!"</p>
<p>"Sir! It was my fault for not coming back to cook, but please forgive me, my belly is too big. I originally wanted to rush back at noon, but I suddenly felt dizzy and fainted. But you say I'm not as good as the Four-Horse Road prostitutes, and I don't agree with that. They don't have any "embarrassment" at all. They deliberately say they're afraid of embarrassment, but in reality, they're even less afraid of embarrassment."</p>
<p>I didn't want to listen anymore and closed the door. This burst of noise stirred up every nerve in my body. This nanny seems to only understand the algebraic formula: negative plus positive still equals zero. People who are not afraid of embarrassment say they are embarrassed, but their skin is still thick: "The shame of having no shame is also shameless." This formula used in reverse, hatred plus no hatred, national shame plus shamelessness, still equals zero. So, after May 7th and May 9th, even though we lost the Northeast, lost Rehe, lost.... it still doesn't matter.</p>
<p>This statement is so comforting, everyone has lightened the burden of defending against foreign enemies. But "this also makes it impossible not to resent the predecessors: if a group of people hadn't shouted so loudly during the May Fourth Movement, China would not have had any national shame at all. And if China had signed the Treaty of Versailles at that time, Japan might have politely stopped asking for our Northeast after having the benefits of the Twenty-One Demands. Even if they wanted it, with fifteen years of recuperation, fifteen years of lessons, and a long-term resistance effort, we would have already succeeded halfway by now.</p>
<p>Let's not worry about old hatreds. In this annoying weather in May, the days are long and long. If you think about taking a walk in the streets and alleys, you will encounter many shameless child prostitutes, many pregnant servant women selling their bodies for money, many frustrated young men smelling of meat and wine, many foreign ships carrying guns, sailors, and foreign goods, many...... If you say to run to the countryside, you will accidentally step on a dead female baby in the grass, or a strange cannonball with the word "Taisho" on it, or crying and wailing poor people, or...... How can these not stir up people's infinite new sorrow?</p>
<p>You can see that women are inherently unfit to do any great work, whether in terms of intellect or material things... Women are only fit to be nannies and tutors for us in our childhood, because they are childlike, frivolous, and short-sighted themselves. In short, they are just big children for a lifetime, in an era between children and adults."</p>
<p>Second, he said that women's duty is to give birth to children, serve their husbands, and manage household affairs. "Women should pay attention to household affairs, eat their fill, and dress warmly, but they should not mix in society. Religious education should be available, but they cannot read poetry, prose, or politics. Except for religious or cooking books, all other books are forbidden to read."</p>
<p>Third, he opposed women's equality, his reason being: "In this world where monogamy prevails, after a person marries, his rights are reduced by half, and his obligations are doubled. Since the law gives women equal rights with men, the law must also give them a kind of masculine knowledge. But the honor and rights that the law gives to women exceed those that the creator gave to them. The more laws are made, the fewer women are able to enjoy these rights. All the natural rights of the rest of the women</p>
<p>are deprived by the few in the upper class."</p>
<p>Fourth, he argued that women should not have inheritance rights. The reason is: "Property is obtained by men through hard work over a very long period and suffering great pain. If this property later falls into the hands of women, they do not know the value of money and spend it all within a very short period in a muddleheaded way, which is extremely inappropriate, but such things often happen. To prevent such things from happening, women's right to inherit should be limited."</p>
<p>Fifth, he advocated polygamy, his reason being: in countries with polygamy, every woman has a master, but in countries with monogamy, the number of women who can marry is limited, leaving behind a large group of women who have no place to live and no one to support them. If these women belong to the upper class, they will live in comfort and become useless old maids. If they belong to the lower class, they will have to do hard work that they are not fit for, or become prostitutes, and their lives will be miserable, with no joy or dignity. "Therefore, from the perspective of women as a whole, polygamy is indeed a real benefit. And from that perspective, if a man's wife is old and sick, or cannot have children, or is too old, why can't he marry a second one?"</p>
<p>Schopenhauer's remarks can still find many, many sympathizers in our country today. However, the wheel of history is moving forward relentlessly. Each of the above opinions of Schopenhauer has now been overturned by facts, and there is no need for us to waste our ink here to refute him. What is worth our attention here is that the great British and French thinkers of Schopenhauer's time mostly advocated women's liberation. Why are Schopenhauer's views so conservative and reactionary?</p>
<p>People's will does not determine their lives, but rather their lives in society determine people's will. The root of Schopenhauer's reactionary and conservative thoughts should naturally be sought in the social and economic conditions of Germany at the time and in his personal living environment. At that time, Germany was still a completely feudal system, economic life was still滞留在serfdom, and male chauvinism and patriarchal ideas enveloped the entire society. Moreover, Schopenhauer grew up in a landlord's family, all of which could not but be reflected in Schopenhauer's thoughts.</p>
<p>Secondly, Schopenhauer's entire ideological system is reactionary, idealistic, and pessimistic. He believes that the world is just people's will and ideas; life is a vanity and chaos, in which living things struggle with each other and destroy each other; to escape the hell of existence, one can only overcome the will to live, only by suffering. This kind of thinking cannot but determine his conservative attitude towards women's issues.</p>
<p>Thirdly, his life was also very secluded and lonely. He did not have a single close friend in his life, whether male or female. He only had a dog, which never left him. This lonely life was also a major reason for him to despise women and oppose women's liberation.</p>
<p>Here, from the ideological systems of Schopenhauer and the several thinkers mentioned earlier and their opinions on women's issues, we can draw a conclusion in principle: those who are ideologically conservative are bound to oppose women's liberation. Conversely, those who advocate women's liberation, their entire ideology must also be progressive. We can get sufficient evidence of this conclusion later.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Women and the Law <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Yun</p>
<p>-- Understanding the relationship between women and the law from a historical perspective</p>
<p>We must first ask: what exactly is the law? Most legal scholars or legal philosophers generally believe that law is a kind of "norm" that "regulates" the relationship between people, and an effective tool to protect the inherent rights of "the people" and to punish those who infringe on these rights. Therefore, they sing praises of the law as sacred, and the "equality" of the people before the law is true equality. But from the perspective of modern social science, the so-called law is, in fact, nothing more than a complex means used by a group of people who control the economy and politics in a certain society to protect their own special rights. Obviously, under this complex and sanctimonious means, countless people are being sacrificed. Needless to say, when those who are sacrificed rise up to protest or demand that the law pay attention to their rights, the law sometimes has to show them a little concession. That is to say, as history progresses, the law cannot but gradually want to broaden the scope it protects and narrow the limits of its sanctions. Therefore, historically speaking, the law itself is also an evolving thing, and can even accurately reflect the stage of social evolution and the depth of social relations.</p>
<p>When did the law first become related to women? To answer this question, we cannot but look back at history. We know that there was a period in human society, and a very long period, when there was no law. That is the primitive society and the clan commune society. At that time, people were jointly producing and jointly consuming, and the phenomenon of inequality between people had not yet occurred. People lived in the embrace of nature, and the relationship between them was extremely simple, so there was no need for that complex and sanctimonious "regulator" -- the law. But at that time, the people -- including women -- were truly equal to each other. Since the feudal demons changed the original social organization, they plundered the property of the majority of people by means of cruel force, and created</p>
<p>a kind of political power, for the first time dividing human beings into various classes of exploiters and the exploited, and oppressors and the oppressed. At the same time, women were also generally despised and oppressed. In order to prove the legitimacy of their special rights in front of the exploited and oppressed, the demons created the law for the first time, and the law took care of the heads of women for the first time. Naturally, the law in feudal society was only an extremely crude prototype, mostly mixed with the traditional customs of the time, the doctrines of religion, and the orders of feudalism, and was very far from modern law. Therefore, what the law at that time gave to women was not the protection of their rights, but cruel punishment and brutal insult. For example, the "seven grounds for divorce" for married women in our country in the old days was as brutal and cruel to women as a killing machine. I don't know how many women were sacrificed on this killing machine.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the unremitting progress of history! In the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution occurred in England, and at the same time, the Democratic Revolution broke out in France, which opened a new era in human history. On the one hand, the giant arm of the Industrial Revolution liberated women from the narrow and tragic shackles of the old family, sent them to work independently in various productive enterprises, and introduced them to</p>
<p>gradually enter various social occupations. In this way, a part of women gained considerable economic independence. On the other hand, the democratic bombs of the French Revolution fiercely bombed the centuries of barbaric despotism. Politically, the banner of "men are born with the right to freedom and equality" (Article 1 of the "Declaration of the Rights of Man") was also raised high, and the principle of "all people are equal before the law" was marked out. At this time, women were publicly recognized as equal to men for the first time, and were able to enjoy equal rights with men in law. This is a great progress after all! But since then, what exactly have women actually gained from the legal aspect? Have they really achieved complete liberation since then? This is a question worth studying. Due to the limited scope of this article, I can only end here!</p>
<h3 id="e221">Mother's Musings <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Quan</p>
<p>"Having been a mother for eight years now," due to a lack of good education, environment, and living conditions, our children have grown up in a precarious manner without proper upbringing. When the children's father was still alive, our life was entirely unstable. Amidst the tumultuous times, the children were deprived of the happiness and peace they deserved. In the past two years, since the burden of life fell upon my bare shoulders, I have been struggling to make ends meet under the lash of life, let alone any education or ideals. Yet, precisely because of this, the sensitive mother's heart is constantly surging with endless thoughts. If I were to put them to pen and paper, I might be able to produce a few seemingly ordinary yet meaningful pieces of writing. "Mother's Musings" is born out of this motivation.</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>(1) On Stealing</p>
<p>The day before the start of spring break, I went to a small school to pick up my eldest son who was boarding there. During a conversation with the teachers, I learned that he had been behaving improperly lately (it is said that the teachers were reluctant to openly use the word "stealing" to the family. On the monthly school report, they only vaguely filled in "casually taking other people's belongings," but in reality, they wanted the family to understand the meaning of "stealing"). This news made me, who was struggling in poverty and trying to be an honest person, feel extremely ashamed and indignant. I really wanted to give him a good scolding upon returning home, but then I thought that a seven- or eight-year-old child does not understand the difference between right and wrong, and is born in an environment with strong material temptations, so threats are not as good as reasoning.</p>
<p>Starting with the "distinction between self and others," I extended it to "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame," doing my best. But my child seemed to have a natural expression of half-knowing and half-believing. In order to satisfy his childish material desires, I automatically increased his daily allowance from six copper coins to nine, which was naturally the best I could do. But the child was not satisfied, grateful, or joyful, which started to surprise me. I repeatedly pressed him for the reason, and his clear answer made me suddenly understand the core of the problem. However, to eliminate his bad habit, I had to say sternly, "They are them, and we are not the same as them. They can be extravagant, but we shouldn't follow them. There are people who don't even have food to eat, and you're still not content!"</p>
<p>In the depths of my heart, I have a clear understanding of this problem: "What is nine copper coins? Others have two dimes! They buy cakes and pastries, and so much candy!" As the child said, there are many people in this society who enjoy absolute comfort, making the poor drool and their eyes burn with envy. The child, the child understands nothing of fate or destiny, such profound "worldly wisdom." If others have good enjoyment, why shouldn't they have it themselves? If they don't have good enjoyment like others, why shouldn't they use some means to get it? So-called stealing, so-called robbery, honestly speaking, would not arise without the unequal distribution of society. Then, if you want your son to stop committing crimes (?), first you have to find a way to make him not feel the lack of life, at least passively prevent those with money from having excessive enjoyment! Do you understand that these are impossible to do for a while? Then shouldn't you plant some clear and reasonable basic awareness in his mind? Due to the so-called combination of force and reason, making him distortedly understand some of the principles of being a loyal and weak class, making his spirit forever trapped in shackles, his life tolerantly tasting the bitter juice, does our society need such a child?</p>
<p>"Others have money, so they should live comfortably. We are not worthy to be compared with them. Others have money, so there is no need to talk about thrift, but we should be content. Even if we have no food to eat, it is destined by fate..." Ah! How ashamed! I taught my son such a great way of obeying fate, being content with one's lot, admiring the rich and despising the poor! (End of this section, the entire article is not finished.)</p>
<h3 id="e222">After Marriage (Continued) <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Lian Sheng</p>
<p>Even worse, he blames me for making the wrong decision. With my looks, I could have married a rich young man, then I could enjoy myself every day, how pleasant! How satisfying! I really wanted to slap him. He shouldn't say such things to me. But I just smiled. Endless pain, endless grievances, only to be endured in my heart. What else can I say? I don't want to say anything either.</p>
<p>I understand, I understand, I am just a weak person, the weakest of the weak.</p>
<p>Before, the ideal married life... Now, it's all turned into illusion! I only deeply feel the etherealness of life! Unrelated!</p>
<p>In this world, how many happy marriages are there? I am confident: I still love him, and he deeply loves me. Although, the time for us to separate is coming soon!</p>
<p>Here, there is no crying, no tears. Only picking up endless hidden pain to seek happiness for society, to serve society.</p>
<p>Marriage, how many people's youth has it buried? From my personal observation, I have lost courage, passion, and struggle because of marriage...</p>
<p>There is only seeking a way out in society. Marriage is a dead end for us women! I understand, I deeply understand -</p>

<p>The yarn market remains firm, due to brisk sales of spot yarn. Demand for coarse yarn in North China is very strong, and stocks at various factories are dwindling daily. At the same time, the selling price of Japanese yarn is rising, which is driving up the price of Chinese yarn. Short covering is occurring. However, rumors circulated later in the market that the Shenxin factory was releasing 6,000 bales of "Red Man Bell" yarn, causing a softening trend at the third closing. It is said that the market will be closed on May 9th in commemoration of National Humiliation Day.</p>

<p>At the opening of the forward yarn market, the lack of major sellers caused prices for all months to rise by about one yuan. As speculative buyers closed out their positions at the second and third sessions, prices fell again. As a result, prices for all months rose by only 1.2 or 3 dimes. The market remained tight after the afternoon opening, but factory rumors surfaced mid-session, causing a softer close. Prices for all months rose by 1.3 or 4 dimes, with the far month falling by one dime. Total daily trading volume was 57,600 bales.

<p>A New York dispatch on the 4th reports on the cotton market for the week: Last week, the cotton market fell due to long liquidation and manufacturer selling. Southern selling was not heavy. Selling pressure gradually decreased when prices fell below 11 cents, and industry participants also absorbed some supply. However, buyers failed to follow foreign cotton upward in the second half of the week, causing slight price discrepancies. The main buyers throughout the week were Japanese merchants who bought on small dips. Other factors await developments in Washington regarding the silver issue, as well as new crop harvests and the overall cotton industry situation. Cloth trading is sluggish, and talk of factory production cuts is increasing.</p>
<h3 id="e239">American Cotton Rises Over Thirty Points <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market was firm due to good news from Liverpool, foreign buying, and a lack of sellers. Spot prices rose by 30 points and futures prices rose by 29 to 33 points. Liverpool spot cotton fell by 4 points and futures rose by 6-7 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 2 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to European exporters buying old cotton, but this was offset by long profit-taking. As a result, Pinga fell by 2 rupees and 7.5 annas, Omra fell by 3 rupees, and White Row Creek fell by 3 rupees and 2.5 annas. (Telegraph Dispatch from the 4th).</p>

<h3 id="e240">Silk and Tea: Pessimism Mounts in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Regarding Spring Silkworms <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Continuous Rain and Cold, Stuffy Weather Cause Changes</p>
<p>Lanxi: Lanxi in Jinhua, Zhejiang, has the earliest silkworm season. This year's silkworm farming is less successful. Native breeds account for 40-50% of hatching. Due to the lingering cold, ant collection was late. In addition, continuous rain and low temperatures caused early silkworms to develop diseases such as "yellow discharge," "black vomit," and "white muscardine" during the third sleep, peak leaf-eating stage. Losses reached 70-80%, so farmers supplemented with late silkworms and bred improved varieties. The silkworm season was later, but the weather was still unfavorable. High temperatures caused black and brown spots to appear on the bodies of 2nd and 3rd instar silkworms. They moved slowly and ate less. The stuffy weather caused many silkworms to stop eating and die. However, losses among late-stage (improved variety) young silkworms are still minimal.</p>
<p>Chongde: Farmers have suffered consecutive silkworm crop failures. The late sprouting of mulberry buds due to the spring cold delayed and unevened out hatching. Native breed silkworms are mostly turning yellow. In areas around Tujia Dam and Fujia Bridge, improved varieties are being bred to supplement. Ant emergence is also uneven. Early stage silkworms are starting their second sleep, while late stage silkworms have only been eating leaves for 6-7 days. Recently, prolonged rain has delayed silkworm dormancy and reduced appetite. There are occasional occurrences of "grasserie" disease, which spreads rapidly. Measures are being taken to isolate infected silkworms and thoroughly disinfect the silkworm rearing room and equipment to prevent further spread.</p>
<p>Yuyao: In areas such as Tianyuan City and Linxi Township, many farmers raise their own native breeds. After ant collection, the weather was abnormal, with fluctuating cold and warmth. During the second and third sleep, eating rain-soaked leaves caused diarrhea and foul-smelling deaths. Therefore, farmers in Henghe Town, Kan Town, and Xiaolu Town are supplementing with improved varieties. However, the cold and rainy weather is delaying development. Recently, the stuffy weather has caused black spots and brown patches to appear on the bodies of silkworms in the second sleep that have fully eaten their leaves. Third sleep silkworms are delaying molting and refusing to eat for a full day and night. The current situation is dire.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: In the model sericulture area, farmers are raising silkworms later this year due to the cold weather. Hatching takes 14-15 days and silkworms have not yet emerged. Efforts have been made to increase temperature using fire, but ant collection is uneven. Early stage silkworms have fully eaten leaves in their first sleep, while late stage silkworms have just started eating. Mulberry trees in the four rural areas are not sprouting well and leaves are only the size of silver dollars. Recent continuous rain and cold weather have hindered silkworm rearing. Farmers are feeding chopped improved mulberry leaves to silkworms. However, early silkworms are showing signs of leaf stagnation and sleeplessness.</p>

<p>The Gong Sheng Yong Tea Firm in this city recently transported two boxes of new black tea from Wenzhou, totaling 121 cases. After extracting samples, many foreign firms made counter offers, but Chinese tea merchants refused to sell due to high transportation costs. The new offers have not yet been released.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Suian Rough Tea Slightly Declines <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Since the opening of Suian's new green tea season last week, cold weather has hampered the flow of goods. Tea merchants from various regions, eager to get ahead of the competition, have been willing to pay higher prices to secure supplies. As a result, the price of rough tea rose to the 90 yuan mark. Upon learning of this market situation, Shanghai tea merchants immediately telegraphed to curb prices. It is now heard that tea prices in that region have fallen back by 10-20 yuan, and the situation is easing slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Grain and Flour Merchants Continue to Sell Off Stock <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed a stable trend for all months after the morning opening. The price of foreign wheat was about 5-6 dimes higher for Chicago wheat and about 3-4 dimes higher for Canadian wheat. Despite stable prices after the opening, market sentiment was difficult to stir. Domestic consumption was affected by the rural recession and the general decline in commodity prices. Although manufacturers requested the government to maintain the market, this has not been very effective. The actual difficulties are difficult to solve with simple words. By the afternoon opening, the near months showed a weak trend due to factory offerings. The distant months were absorbed by outsiders, showing initial signs of improvement. However, after the fourth session, prices declined due to continued selling by most manufacturers. It is unclear what motivated manufacturers to both request support and continue selling. However, their position is contradictory. As a result, the current month rose by 5 li, while June/July fell by 2.5 li, August fell by 7.5 li, September fell by 1.25 cents, and October fell by 1 cent.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Futures Wheat Rises in the Morning, Falls in the Afternoon <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures market initially showed a firm trend in all months after the morning opening. The price of foreign wheat rose by about 5-6 dimes for Chicago wheat and about 3-4 dimes for Canadian wheat. Coupled with continuous rain, market sentiment among both industry insiders and outsiders was relatively stable. As a result, the market was bullish after the opening, with prices rising by 2-3 cents. However, by the afternoon opening, the weather gradually cleared and the rain stopped, causing market sentiment to soften again. Current buyers seem powerless. Interior merchants are naturally inclined to sell as the new wheat crop is approaching the market. Longs are less attentive due to the influx of factories. Therefore, the future is still very concerning. As a result, June fell by 1 cent, July rose by 1 cent, August remained unchanged, and September/October did not open. The spot wheat market stagnated due to factory stoppages, with no activity. However, warehouse inventories are gradually increasing and are said to have reached about 100,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Late Rice Sales Sluggish, Continuing Small Declines <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's supply included late rice of the 18th and 19th grades, thick japonica, and various colors of the 4th and 5th grades (totaling over 3,000 shi). Sales of late rice to both northern and southern merchants have stopped. Although there is some sporadic buying, the market is currently weak. At closing, southern merchants bought a small amount, about 200 bags, followed by northern merchants who bought 200-300 bags. Therefore, the price of Qingjiao, Sifeng, and Liantang etc. continues to decline slightly. Thick japonica remains stable due to limited supply. Duyangjian also saw no changes, and Yinbian Yuan remained unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's shipments from Hexia were limited, about 30 boats. Sales of white japonica, foreign sharp rice, white yuan, Dujian, thin rice, and Shi Qiao were slightly active. The market lacked supply of early rice and Yin Yuan. High-grade white japonica was stable, but mid-grade and low-grade prices declined slightly. Sheep sharp rice also declined by 3-5 points. White Yuan and thin rice were firm. The price of Dujian increased by 3-5 points. Port and guest sharp rice remained stable.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Rough Foreign Rice Rises Another Half Dime <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Mechanized rice is in short supply, soaring 3 dimes. Yesterday's supply of guest indica rice was limited and inventories are dwindling. Sellers are hoping for better prices and continue to raise prices. However, buyers, due to consecutive days of price increases, were hesitant. Merchants from Nan Shao and Quanzhou stopped buying immediately. Therefore, Fuzhou only handled about 400 bags of rough indica rice and 240 bags of mechanized rice yesterday. Local merchants in this city also slowed down purchasing due to high prices. However, merchants from Shantou, Wenzhou, and other inland regions, who had stopped buying for several days, saw the brisk sales in Fuzhou and this city and the soaring prices, and dared not inquire. After the local merchants in Fujian slowed down purchasing yesterday, they took the opportunity to buy. Merchants from Tianjin also purchased 200 bags of Wuxi mechanized rice. Mechanized rice is in short supply at both river factories and warehouses. The price opened at 9.5 yuan yesterday, a huge increase of 3 dimes compared to the previous day. Warehouse holders were slightly less interested, but local village sales remained active. Together, merchants from Wenzhou, Shantou, the interior, and the northern ocean bought about 3,000 bags. The market for guest indica and mechanized rice is temporarily stable. However, the price of reclaimed rough foreign rice opened at 5.4 yuan for 500 bags of Siamese rough rice, another increase of half a dime. There is a large inventory of small-kernel rice, so it is temporarily stable.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Sugar Market: Domestic Sliced Green Sugar Continues to Open with 300 Cases <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday's sugar market, tariffs rendered Customs Gold without a market. Forward Gold remained flat with little change in trend. The association's price for No. 24 coarse sand white sugar remained unchanged with no transactions. The firm's stock of 21.2 yuan drew some offers. Eight and nine grade Dutch red sugar, Taikoo Sugar B mark, and domestic factory white sugar all saw little activity. Domestic Chaozhou green sugar opened with only 100+ bags for extraction at 11.8 yuan. A Guangzhou firm opened with 300 small cases of sliced green sugar at 9 yuan. A Huizhou white sugar opened with 100+ bags at 17 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Inventory of Dried Lily Flowers is Low in Both Northern Provinces <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>New crop not expected for two more months... Further price increases still expected.</p>
<p>Since the price increase, dried lily flowers have seen declining sales due to a lack of sustained demand. However, market supply is confirmed to be low, at no more than 800 bags. Based on past sales volume, a market price of 20 yuan should have been reached long ago. However, this year's demand has been intermittent, leading to irregular price fluctuations. Currently, only Guangdong merchants occasionally purchase small amounts, with little activity from other regions. The trend is toward stabilization due to low inventory. If sales pick up, the price of 20 yuan is still possible. The new crop is not expected for two more months, and the cost of new goods is estimated to be above 20 yuan.</p>

<p>Hardware trading was very quiet yesterday. The overall market was dull. However, sales of corrugated iron were relatively good. Trading was quite lively, with 700-800 dan offered. Buyers were Qingdao and Tianjin merchants, with little interest from the local market due to the abundance of Eastern goods. Prices were estimated at 13.85 yuan per box for 28-gauge, 13.3 yuan for 26-gauge, 12.4 yuan for 24-gauge, and 12.25 yuan for 22-gauge, a slight increase of 2-3 dimes compared to the previous standard. It is heard that the price of Eastern goods has also increased due to the Eastern exchange rate, resulting in limited trading.</p>

<p>Since northern merchants stopped buying, the small Guangzhou leather market has been quiet for a long time. Yesterday, a enamelware factory bought 200 cases, revitalizing the market. Prices were 10 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Oil Market: It Remains Difficult to Expect Lower Prices for White Tung Oil <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>After the price of white tung oil in Hankou foreign firms rose to 28 yuan per picul last week, it quickly fell back to 28 yuan, then 27.8 yuan. Foreign firms, seeing the market trending downward, stopped purchasing in hopes of lower prices. However, after holding for a week, the situation remains unusually stable. Although foreign firms have stopped purchasing, the supply remains low, making it difficult for trading to slow down. Hankou's inventories remain low. Incoming goods are not willing to be sold at lower prices. The southern branch firms have raised their offers to 22.8 yuan for goods including tax, and 22.8 yuan for goods without tax. Xiang Tung is offered at 23 yuan, a buyer's price. Overall, the yield was only 50% last winter, leading to a large decrease in production. Therefore, sellers are very firm. As a result, the market is unlikely to see lower prices even if foreign firms continue to refrain from trading. If foreign trading resumes, the upward trend may continue unabated. Zhejiang tung oil has gradually risen due to the influence of the Hankou market. Recently, firms in this city have purchased several hundred piculs from Zedong, with prices ranging from 22.2 yuan to 22.5 yuan. The price of Jiangjia is heard to be 23 yuan.</p>

<p>— Song Fen</p>
<p>Editor's Note: This piece was handed to the editor in person by a reader who said that he could no longer contain his indignation at the increasingly perilous situation in China recently. He said that this short essay was written with the utmost and purest patriotic fervor, and he hopes for the readers' earnest criticism, and even more hopes that it will resonate with the readers. We absolutely share Mr. Song's sentiments and firmly believe that readers will as well. However, at the same time, we must also consider, what use is merely impassioned indignation! What we need most is to find a way to encourage the people of the whole country to actively rise up and urge the government to act as a shield for the people and to break through this depressing predicament.</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper on May 1st, the eye is already filled with alarming news, as if unfolding a broken and tragic picture of China's current state.</p>
<p>Since September 18th, the policy of passively accepting aggression has resulted in not only what Mr. Pierson, a Far Eastern problem expert from the United States, stated in his official report to the Foreign Policy Association: "Japan's recent occupation of Manchuria and Jehol, the extent of the land, is equivalent to the 2.4 million square miles that China has lost in the ninety years since Britain annexed Hong Kong in 1842." This is still comforting our dear compatriots who cherish a false sense of pride! If we are unwilling to deceive ourselves and acknowledge the facts, consider Japan's actual control of North China, Britain's seizure of Xikang and Panhong, the Sino-British meddling and attempt to establish an independent Muslim state in Xinjiang, France's occupation of the nine islands of Qiongnan, as well as the strengthening of British influence in Sichuan and Guangdong, French influence in Yunnan and Guangxi, the United States' monopoly in national aviation and general transportation, especially the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson's open declaration on April 17th of exclusively controlling China... If we temporarily close the book on all these facts and take stock, we will realize that the tragedy of national subjugation and the extinction of our race has long been a deeply felt pain for us for the past three years. Even before our children are born, their fate as slaves has already been arranged by the enemy.</p>
<p>Like today's special dispatch, Legislator So-and-so's observation that "China will definitely not be subjugated in the short term, because the country is too large, and Japan cannot swallow it in one gulp no matter what" is like a blind man fortune-telling; as for the argument that Japan's "increasing aggression can inspire national spirit," it is as if the tyrannical Japan's unbridled invasion and our own servile obedience have not yet reached the stage of perfect merit. This is simply the "sound of a dying nation"—</p>
<p>The dissemination of this kind of humiliating thought and the means of Japan's revised statement have the exact same purpose: to deceive us into bowing our heads and stepping into the colonial hell from which there is no return! Know that even if Japan's statement of revision is out of sincerity, it is also to alleviate the atmosphere in Europe and America, a way of peaceful partition of spoils. The British Foreign Secretary announced clearly in the House of Commons: "Equal rights and principles in China are guaranteed by the Nine-Power Treaty in extremely clear terms," except for "special rights possessed by Japan that are recognized by other countries," "Japan cannot be recognized as having the right to unilaterally decide on any special actions, such as a banking consortium." Here, the invocation of the Nine-Power Treaty is not to protect China's territorial integrity but to carve up China, this fat sheep, and everyone should have a share, and Japan should not swallow it alone. "The British government has resolved, to the greatest extent possible and in the spirit of international cooperation, to assist China's progress towards peace and prosperity and towards harmony and goodwill in the Far East," etc. This is the diplomatic language of Sir John Simon, which, translated into Japanese, means: Under Japan's exclusive control of China, the principle of the open door must be recognized, so that European and American powers have the opportunity to jointly manage China. Japan has special rights, and European and American powers have general rights; the ones who are always slaves are China and the Chinese people! Under Japan's exclusive control, China is subjugated and the Chinese people are slaves; under the joint management of the powers, China is still subjugated, and the Chinese people are still slaves. Which kind of slave do we, the Chinese people, want to be? Or, do we not want to be any kind of slave and seek our own path to survival?</p>
<p>If 400 million Chinese people are unwilling to be slaves, no matter how fierce the enemy in the world is, they have no way to force us to be slaves! The past policy of non-resistance has in fact led to exclusive control and joint management. We must wash away the "non-resistance doctrine" that leads to national subjugation. The only way out for the nation is "resistance." He comes with a punch, and I go with a kick. You cannot talk about morality and benevolence to jackals and wolves. We must recognize that the greatest enemy of the nation at present is tyrannical Japan. Resisting tyrannical Japan is the greatest task facing the nation. Revive the movement to boycott Japanese goods to stop the dumping of Japanese goods; develop the war of the volunteer army to drive out Japanese ruffians and retired officers in China; confiscate all Japanese enterprises in China to respond to Japan's seizure of Chinese land and property; mobilize the nation's military and financial resources to expel the Japanese army in China and recover all lost territories since September 18th. We use a sacred war of freedom to stop Japan's violent aggression. People across the country, regardless of each other, recognize the current national crisis, put aside everything, and work together wholeheartedly to complete one task: the cause of resisting Japan and saving the nation! Believe in one doctrine: the doctrine of resisting Japan and saving the nation! Those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength; the whole country, from top to bottom, men, women, old, and young, unite into a strong army to fight against Japan, with the spirit of disregarding one's own life, the determination to burn the boats, and extinguish the poisonous flames of tyrannical Japan. This is the only way out, the way to victory, for the Chinese nation! The people of the whole country must use the means of punishing tyrannical Japan to denounce the running dogs of tyrannical Japan!</p>
<p>Compatriots across the country, the beautiful mountains and rivers that our ancestors have painstakingly created over thousands of years have been passed down to us. We cannot let tyrannical Japan monopolize them, nor can we let international joint management take place! We must use a glorious, sacred, and righteous national war to extinguish tyrannical Japan, warn the powers, and open up a path to freedom and independence for the nation!</p>

<h3 id="e254">Incense Making Lane <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zhemin</p>
<p>Spring is a season for burning incense. After the Qingming Festival, it is probably the time when incense is most popular in temples. Every year, a certain amount of money is spent on burning incense to worship Buddha, heaven, and ancestors. Although there are no precise statistics, it is undoubtedly a particularly huge number. Superstitious ideas have been slightly reduced due to the progress of material science, but on the contrary, due to the promotion of some powerful people, there seems to be a more rampant trend.</p>
<p>A superficial observation of incense shops and incense making in Shanghai. There are no less than 150 incense shops in Shanghai, and the most are in Nanshi and Zhabei. Pudong's Lanni Ferry, Yangjia Ferry, and Dongjia Ferry, and Huxi's Caojia Ferry, Zhoujia Bridge, and Beixinjing are also numerous. These are incense shops that have their own workshops. From here, we can easily understand the nature of China's semi-feudal society and the deeply rooted superstitious ideas.</p>
<p>I have visited several workshops, and I think that making incense is one of the most arduous and strenuous jobs in handicraft. It is almost unbelievable that their working hours start from one o'clock in the morning and last until five or six o'clock in the afternoon the next day, about sixteen hours a day. Because most stores employ them based on "piecework," calculated according to the piecework system. The more they make, the more they can earn. How can they not desperately sell their lives?</p>
<p>Sometimes, even if they are willing to sell their lives, they may not be able to. Making incense depends on the weather. If it rains and there is no sun, the incense cannot be dried, and they have to stop. During festivals such as New Year, Qingming, Dragon Boat Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival, the demand for incense is high, and production can be increased; during the rest of the time, such as June, July, September, or October, the demand for incense is low, and they don't need to work hard. For these reasons, they only have about twenty days of work per month on average.</p>
<p>The working process of incense making is extremely unsanitary and very strenuous. The earliest step is mixing the incense. According to the type and fineness of the incense, the appropriate raw materials are mixed evenly. At this time, the mist of incense powder (not the incense powder used by young ladies and wives) will ruthlessly attack your nostrils, your mouth, and your eyes, making you unable to breathe, unable to open your mouth, and unable to open your eyes. They must be familiar with various raw materials and mixing methods. There are several types of raw materials. The most common ingredient is makko powder; the second is elm powder (which is about twice as expensive as makko powder), which is used to increase the viscosity of the incense. Cypress powder is used to make the incense look good and increase the fragrance. There are also joss powder and wood shavings, because wood shavings are cheap and can reduce costs—After becoming familiar with these, one can hope to do well. Otherwise, the incense made will not be good. The boss will not only haggle and deduct from the wages, but also destroy the bad incense and remake it, turning your hard work into nothing.</p>
<p>After the raw materials are mixed, they encounter one of the most serious tasks. That is the work of mixing evenly after adding water. They, like the master chefs who knead dough to make steamed buns, must knead various raw materials left and right; and the things in the incense trough that absorb their energy are so many that they must take off their shirts (even in winter) and use all their strength to continue working hard for more than three or four hours to succeed. You can see steam coming out of their entire bodies: although their strong muscles are full of power, as soon as you see them panting non-stop, you will know that this is not a job to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>This is often a task that should be done before noon. After kneading, put it in the open air to dry, and then they can go to have dinner and sleep. They go to bed at six or seven o'clock because the work of pulling incense at one o'clock in the morning is waiting for them. This job is less strenuous, just pulling the incense blocks into strips and placing them on the incense rack, waiting for the morning sun to dry them. However, doing this mechanical and monotonous thing for a long time will make your hands sore and your back ache!</p>
<p>Their skills are very related to their wages. Shanghai incense is much more exquisite than inland incense, and there are more types. Common ones include thread incense, stick incense, coil incense, longevity incense, mosquito incense... Each type has various differences. Not every incense maker knows and is proficient in these skills. For example, many people cannot make mosquito incense or do not make it well. Therefore, there are some levels in skills. The best craftsman is called "Shangzhuang" (top workshop), the slightly worse one is called "Erzhuang" (second workshop), and then there are apprentices. The daily income for hard work is about 50 cents for Shangzhuang, about 40 cents for Erzhuang, and apprentices are usually unpaid. Shangzhuang works an average of 20 days a month, earning about ten silver dollars.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a type of incense packaging worker, who is hired by large incense shops to produce in large quantities for wholesale to cigarette paper shops and sundries shops. Their reward is one copper coin for packaging each incense stick. They can package five or six hundred incense sticks a day. Isn't that almost two silver dollars a day? Not really. There is not that much incense for them to pack. Incense shops will never leave their cashiers, clerks, and apprentices idle at the counter. This kind of incense packaging work is only available when demand exceeds supply.</p>
<p>Speaking of their diet, I must point out that yellow croaker, spinach, tofu, green vegetables, and pickles are the best. As for entertainment, they have nothing else besides playing cards for a few hundred coins on rainy days.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Current Affairs Research: What is Japan Intending? <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Shao</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th" Incident, although Japan has continued to plunder China's four northeastern provinces with bandit-like methods, and has seized many benefits in North China and even South China, at the same time, due to the development of domestic economic panic, political unrest, and the continuous resistance of the Chinese people in the Northeast, and the inability to stabilize the so-called "Manchukuo," Japan has become increasingly mired in a crisis from which it cannot extricate itself. In the conflict of interests between international imperialism in the Pacific and in China, because Japan's ambition to annex China and dominate East Asia has been fully exposed, it has become diplomatically isolated. Under this situation of "domestic and external troubles," Japan, in addition to actively embarking on the road of war to try a final gamble, is also trying its best to take advantage of the conflict between its two major enemies in the Pacific—Britain and the United States—to realize its ambition to dominate East Asia.</p>
<p>However, no matter what, Japan's excessive actions in China have caused great unease to both Britain and the United States. In order to ease its conflicts with Britain and the United States, and to increase the conflicts between Britain and the United States and profit from them, Japan does not hesitate to use flowery language to conduct friendly negotiations with Washington and commercial negotiations with Britain. After the British-Japanese and Japanese-American negotiations had results, and after the so-called diplomatic victory in Tokyo, Japan then proceeded to test whether the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards it were consistent. The League of Nations was at this time conducting "technical cooperation" with China, and banking groups from Britain, the United States, and other countries were planning a private silver company with China, discussing investment in China, "helping China build," and other issues, without inviting Japan to participate; this, of course, gave Japan an excuse. Thus, with a thunderclap, on April 17, the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a "Declaration on China," stating its "special position" in East Asia and opposing the attempt by other powers to jointly manage or partition China.</p>
<p>This opposition to the so-called "special rights" in China threatens its actions, just as Britain and the United States are dissatisfied with Japan's plunder of the Northeast. This is a manifestation of the conflict of imperialist interests in China; at the same time, in the midst of this, Japan is using astonishing statements and harsh tones to test whether the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards it are consistent, and to determine its policies. At first, London seemed as if a huge bomb had fallen from the sky, expressing great astonishment at Japan's declaration on China, but the atmosphere in Washington was very calm: after Japan explained its declaration on China and superficially revoked its original position, British Foreign Secretary Simon felt that the "incident had come to an end," but the United States, on the contrary, expressed a serious attitude, formally lodging a protest with Japan, opposing the "East Asian Monroe Doctrine" and reiterating the Nine-Power Treaty. --This clearly shows the inconsistency of the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards Japan, indicating the initial success of Japan's trial. The reason why Japan is slow to issue its statement and not to respond to the US note is that it sees that the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards it have begun to show inconsistent situations, and it wants to wait quietly for the growth of the conflict between Britain and the United States, in order to profit from it.</p>
<p>If Britain and the United States cannot consistently maintain the same attitudes toward Japan, then Imperial Japan will use all means to launch a fierce attack on China, pressuring China to break away from the shackles of Britain and the United States, and be completely subject to Tokyo's control. Because although the cunning Japanese imperialism wants to expel British and American forces from China and dominate East Asia, it will never personally come forward to fight Britain and the United States with force unless it is absolutely necessary. It will inevitably pressure China not to accept the aggression policies of Britain and the United States, and even oppose Britain, the United States, and other imperialists, and be completely controlled by Japan. In this way, if it succeeds, it will, of course, be a complete victory for Japan. If it fails, it will be China that suffers, and it will have nothing to do with it. Recently, Japan's increasing troops to North China, putting forward direct negotiations to China, and opening fire in Changshu... all these are concrete manifestations of this conspiracy.</p>
<p>In this situation, what should China do? Seek help from Britain and the United States? They, like Japan, are imperialists, who are always trying to divide or jointly manage, or even exclusively control, China. Therefore, our only way out is in our own struggle. If we do not rise up ourselves, but rely on any imperialist to seek rescue, the result will be national subjugation!</p>
<h3 id="e256">The Effectiveness of Germany's Relief for the Unemployed <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Mengbai</p>
<p>Under the administration of the Nazi Party in Germany, great attention has also been paid to the issue of unemployment relief, and since the curtain on the unemployment relief movement has been drawn, considerable results have been achieved. Looking back, in January 1933, the total number of unemployed workers in Germany was 6,000,000, according to statistics. However, at present, there are only 3,250,000 people, and since the German government launched the second unemployment relief worker movement on March 21 of this year, it is expected that the number of unemployed workers can be further reduced by 2,000,000.</p>
<p>According to a report by the Nazi Party Propaganda Committee, since Germany held the unemployment relief worker movement, the record of industrial and commercial bankruptcies has decreased by 46 percent, and in 1933 alone, commodity sales in 1933 also exceeded those in 1932 by 12 percent; as for the turnaround in the factory sector, as of the end of 1933, there was an increase of 140,000,000 marks in capital compared to the end of 1932; the wool textile industry increased by 6.4 billion marks in 1932, and 7.1 billion in 1933.</p>
<p>As stated above, under the vigorous implementation of the unemployment relief worker movement in Germany, the extreme development of industry and commerce, directly and indirectly, has been sufficient to reduce the number of unemployed workers. Looking back at our China, rural bankruptcy, industrial and commercial depression, the number of unemployed people has exceeded that of any country in the world, and neither the government nor society has a way to provide relief to unemployed workers.</p>
<p>Compared with Germany, it is really regrettable!</p>

<h3 id="e257">The Soviet Union's Forest School <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Huangyin</p>
<p>At the gate of a shady garden, a rosy-cheeked little girl named Gelya is crying: "I don't want to leave here." Three months ago, a pale and weak girl cried at the same gate, and she refused to go in no matter what.</p>
<p>"Why can Lida, Valya, and Kolya stay in this forest school? I don't want to go home either!"</p>
<p>The crying child's mother was at a loss, but she was still happy because her six-year-old daughter had gained ten pounds in weight after living in this forest school sanatorium for three months.</p>
<p>She didn't want to go home because she had a lot of fun here. Those well-educated nannies gave her pencils and books and taught her to draw trains. Gelya could already recognize the slogan "Fresh air, sun, and drinks give us health" hanging in her bedroom. Every morning, Gelya gently climbed to the rabbit cage without waking others. These rabbits have white fur and red eyes, how cute!</p>
<p>Next to the forest school is a model farm, which supplies the school with milk and food, and also serves as an educational experiment for teachers and children. It was this farm and good nutrition that made Gelya gain ten pounds.</p>
<p>The children eat five meals a day. According to the needs of each child, the doctor prescribes the most appropriate food for them. When the children sleep, the windows are wide open, and even in winter, they have to sleep in a ventilated place for two or three hours during the day.</p>
<p>Because it is surrounded by forests, this school is called a forest school.</p>
<p>Each forest school has a special department on pedagogy, where doctors and educators study each child. They regularly report their observations to the children's parents. These parents are all kinds of people, some are skilled workers, some are cleaning the courtyard, unskilled workers, technicians, doctors, etc., most of them are workers, but the unemployed are not among them, because there has long been no unemployed in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The children's parents can come to see them once a month. Because it is a sanatorium, outsiders are not allowed to enter the inner rooms of the forest school. The parents gather in an isolated room. Doctors and educators tell them, and also teach them (the floor washers and unskilled workers) how to educate their children. Therefore, the Soviet Union's forest school is also a school for educating parents.</p>
<p>Fourteen such schools have been perfectly established near Moscow, with fifty to two hundred children each. These schools are kindergarten-like in nature, but the ages range from eight to seventeen.</p>
<p>In the sanatorium, older children study the courses of ordinary schools. The Second Five-Year Plan will greatly increase the number of these forest schools.</p>

<h3 id="e258">On the Difficulty of Doing Business <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Keren</p>
<p>Originally, engaging in commerce was a path to wealth; if business went well, one could become another Tao Zhugong. However, the current situation is somewhat peculiar. Many merchants well-versed in the art of business, many established stores, are not only failing to make money and become wealthy, but are also experiencing a daily decline, even heading towards bankruptcy. According to reports, after the lunar New Year, general stores in Shanghai are finding it difficult to sustain themselves. Not only have many less prominent stores announced their closure, but several large stores with significant influence are also struggling to stay afloat. If not for the court's consideration of the overall situation, they would likely have been declared insolvent due to debt. As for other cities, because their industry and commerce are not as developed as Shanghai's, and everything is less convenient, their commerce is even more desolate. In Xuzhou alone, the mass layoffs and closures of stores have resulted in the unemployment of three to four thousand shop assistants—what is the reason for this? In short, it is because we are currently in a year of panic. In this year of panic, even doing business is very difficult.</p>
<p>Let's discuss this in detail now.</p>
<p>First of all, business, that is, doing business, requires customers. The so-called "those who are skilled in business never lack customers" refers to those who are good at trading and dealing with customers. If a store has no business, it can only close down. In China today, due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the sharp decline in general purchasing power, the number of customers in various stores is decreasing day by day. In this situation, if a merchant still follows the usual business practices, demanding a large profit for each item sold, they will face the danger of an empty storefront. Once the storefront is empty and goods cannot be sold, they will face a shortage of cash, hindering economic circulation and leading to bankruptcy. Therefore, in order to boost their business and circulate cash, general merchants have no choice but to lower prices and engage in commercial competition. As a result, phenomena such as buying five feet of cloth for four copper coins, a pencil for two copper coins, and several catties of books for thirty cents have emerged. However, even in such commercial competition, business may not thrive. At the same time, merchants' goods are bought with money, and if they cannot make a profit in this competition, or even lose their capital, they will ultimately have to close down. This is the first reason why business is difficult to do under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>Secondly, because transportation in China is not convenient, the transportation of all goods is very difficult. Coupled with the heavy burden of miscellaneous taxes and duties in various regions and the immature methods of production, this constitutes the excessively high cost of all goods in China. With high costs and few buyers, and competition being so fierce, doing business under these circumstances would likely prevent even the most business-savvy commercial genius from becoming another Tao Zhugong.</p>
<p>At the same time, general merchants rely on loans from money houses and banks to maintain their cash flow. If money houses and banks adopt a particularly conservative policy, refusing to lend to those with less security, many merchants with limited capital will be doomed. Unfortunately, since this spring, money houses and banks, having seen the desolate state of commerce, have indeed adopted a particularly conservative policy, refusing to lend to merchants without special guarantees. As a result, the phenomenon of store closures has become increasingly common. This is the third reason why business is difficult to do under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>In addition, the exploitation of unequal treaties by imperialists, who dump their goods in our country without restriction, is a major cause of the decline of our industry and commerce and the difficulty of doing business.</p>
<p>The difficulty of business is a manifestation of commercial decline; commercial decline is, of course, closely related to the crisis in industry; the crisis in industry and commerce, and the bankruptcy of the rural economy, are the reality of our national economic bankruptcy. The so-called people's livelihood being desolate and social unrest are rooted here. But what is to be done? I have no concrete ideas about this; I only know that these are all the products of China under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e259">After Reading the "Bank of China Business Report" <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Yong</p>
<p>The Bank of China is one of the largest banks in the country. Its business report for the 22nd year of the Republic (1933) was published in newspapers a few days ago. In addition to containing a summary of the bank's business operations, it also details various sectors of the national economy. This not only allows us to see the abnormal development of the banking industry, but also reveals the general economic downturn. An analysis is as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Abnormal development of the banking industry—At a time when all other industries are declining, the banking industry alone is able to profit. This is something we cannot ignore. Regarding the Bank of China's business overview for the 22nd year of the Republic, solely in terms of deposits and loans, the "total remaining balance of various deposits was 539,284,527.16, an increase of 62,736,473.73 compared to the 21st year of the Republic (1932); the total remaining balance of various loans was 351,388,609.15, an increase of 28,497,391.33 compared to the 21st year of the Republic (1932)." The extraordinary development of business is evident. Other Shanghai Chinese banks have also experienced similar development. According to the end of the report: "The amount of currency issued by Shanghai Chinese banks in the 20th year of the Republic (1931) was 454,143,165 yuan, an increase of over 23 million yuan compared to the 21st year (1932); the total amount of deposits was approximately 210 million yuan, an increase of approximately 100 million yuan compared to the 21st year (1932)." Furthermore, six new banks were established, and existing banks added sixteen branch offices. However, "due to a lack of high-quality and high-profit investments, they tend towards government bonds and real estate; those who pay attention to commerce also focus on the narrow channels of lending, discounting the credit collateral of debtors without careful selection; the unreasonable expansion of credit is increasing day by day." This truly reveals the abnormal development of the banking industry.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that in recent years, bank investment has regarded industry and commerce with fear, let alone agriculture. Therefore, "the only funds available in society are absorbed by high-profit government bonds, and everyone sighs and laments the lack of funds for construction and production." On the other hand, the abundance of floating capital does not indicate an increase in social wealth. This is due to the expansion of rural unrest. Wealthy natives are transferring large amounts of money to the cities, considering it safer to deposit in banks and earn meager interest. However, after this floating capital is concentrated in banks, it is reinvested in government bonds and real estate. Therefore, the profits of the banking industry come entirely from these two aspects. In other words, the issuance of government bonds and the concentration of floating capital are the sources of the abnormal development of the banking industry.</p>
<p>2.  The general economic downturn—China is a country based on agriculture, so agriculture constitutes a major component of the national economy. In terms of agricultural production, the food harvest in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), according to various statistics, averaged 6% less nationwide than in the 11th year of the Republic (1922). Other crops such as cotton, tea, and tobacco varied in increase and decrease. Therefore, agricultural imports still reached a huge amount of 400 million yuan. So the rural areas declined to the extreme. However, the reasons for its decline are as follows: "1) the tragic fall of agricultural prices; 2) the increasing burden on farmers; 3) the repercussions of the fall in prices of foreign agricultural products; 4) the unfavorable harvest of agricultural products." However, the government and society did not take many measures to reduce agricultural costs and raise agricultural prices this year. This can be proved by the following facts: "1) the government issued orders to eliminate miscellaneous taxes; but the provinces have not yet taken concrete actions to reduce or eliminate them; 2) financial institutions promoted loans to farmers: each bank either set up agricultural granaries and piloted small loans, or promoted indirect loans through cooperatives; but the total amount was less than six or seven million yuan; 3) the government discussed levying import taxes on foreign rice, but Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, which import the most foreign rice, have not yet implemented the levy." As for the central and provincial agencies that handle agricultural improvement, their numbers are as follows: 46 for administration and design; 161 for experimentation and research; 30 for promotion; and 58 for agricultural finance. However, all kinds of institutions are financially strapped, small in scale, limited in strength, and slow in progress. Such is the so-called achievement of rural revitalization.</p>
<p>Similarly, industry is also in decline. "Taking the industrial sector as a whole, the 22nd year of the Republic (1933) can be called the beginning of a difficult period for the industrial community. In fact, last year's industry, affected by the rural decline and the global economic panic, has already shown a rapid decline. We can see the extent of its decline simply by looking at the reduction in working hours in cotton mills and the closure of silk mills last year. As for other large and small industries, they are all implementing austerity measures in an attempt to overcome this difficulty. But this is just a dream. Moreover, China's industry has other obstacles and is constantly threatened by two forces: the competition from foreign factories set up in China and the dumping of the same imported goods. In short, the development of China's national industry will always be bound by the economics of imperialism until the forces of imperialism are eliminated.</p>
<p>In addition, in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), international trade: the total import amount was 134,500,000 yuan; the total export amount was 61,100,000 yuan, totaling 195,700,000 yuan, and the trade deficit was 73,300,000 yuan. Compared with the 21st year of the Republic (1932), imports decreased by 18%; exports decreased by 20%; and the trade deficit also decreased by 15%." This sharp decline clearly demonstrates the shrinking of purchasing power and the inadequacy of production. The inability to make up for the trade deficit can be proved by the export of silver.</p>
<p>In short, the abnormal development of the banking industry not only fails to remedy the national economy as a whole, but also contributes to social chaos. At the same time, the general economic depression causes production to be inadequate, unemployment to increase, and the lives of most people to be trapped in extreme poverty, so they have no power to buy their daily necessities. As a result, the sharp decline in international trade is promoted. This overall economic bankruptcy is undoubtedly a very serious problem. ▲Continued on page 5▲</p>

<h3 id="e260">Electrical Chicken Farming <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Hua</p>
<p>Using electricity to incubate eggs and raise chicks is undoubtedly the best method. It allows us to obtain a high-quality and abundant supply of poultry in a very short time. Whether in terms of money or labor, this method is much more economical and efficient than any old-fashioned method. Chick mortality can also be reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p>Although the application of this new method is recent in the Soviet Union, as in other countries, the early research and experimental period has already passed, and it has now become an important sector of Soviet industry.</p>
<p>Until 1930, the Soviet Union had virtually no electrical chicken farms. From 1930 to 1931, several scientific and economic institutions conducted some experiments in this area. By 1932, this research had made great progress. Today, this industry is developing rapidly everywhere.</p>
<p>Experience indicates that the best results can be achieved only by entrusting this type of operation to specialized chicken-raising organizations in various regions. In North Caucasus, Crimea, Ukraine, and other places, egg production is very regular. It is very appropriate to treat these chicken farms as independently operated enterprises in various regions.</p>
<p>This type of important operation is particularly developed in North Caucasus, Armavir, Georgievsk, and other places. The average size of the electrical chicken farms here can raise 45,000 to 50,000 chicks. The largest chicken farms in Armavir and Georgievsk can each accommodate 85,000 chicks.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union now has two different methods of raising chickens. One method involves equipping a five-story chicken house according to the age of the chicks. The first floor houses chicks under twenty days old, the second and third floors house chicks over forty days old, and the fourth and fifth floors house chicks over sixty days old. An electrical pipe runs through the center of the five floors to warm each room. The other method involves installing electric wires on a wooden frame that can be freely moved. The entire frame is also heated by electricity. Comparatively, the latter is simpler and allows for larger-scale farming.</p>
<p>Although the chicken-raising business described above is very new in the Soviet Union, chicken farmers can proudly boast that their efforts have been quite successful. For example, in the North Caucasus chicken farm, out of 13,300 newly hatched chicks, only 800 died within sixty days, which is only 6% of the total.</p>
<p>In order to examine the results of the above-mentioned operations, find ways to eliminate various farming defects (such as chick protection and feed), further develop this business, and formulate some management rules for this business, several meetings have been convened by those in charge, farming workers, and representatives of various scientific research institutions.</p>
<p>In order to avoid farming difficulties, the discussion resulted in a more precise distribution of chick feed and attention to the different protection methods for chicks during each stage of their growth. These are all very scientific.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's chicken-raising activities in 1932 have already gained valuable knowledge and experience. With broader and more detailed attention in 1933, there is no doubt that the problem of meat supply in the second five-year plan will be solved without difficulty.</p>

<p>— Yu Si</p>
<p>When it comes to farmers' amateur entertainment, the community opera, which can accommodate hundreds to thousands of people at the same time, is the most popular. Community operas are mostly held in early spring before farming becomes busy, and at the end of autumn after farming is completed. "Grass stage troupes" travel from east village to west village along individual large villages or combined small villages. The villagers in the village where the opera is performed busily and politely invite their old relatives and new friends from various villages in advance. They also rush to the opera to find acquaintances and pull them home, taking out leftover preserved vegetables from the New Year or newly brewed rice wine from the wine jar to entertain guests, wishing them good harvests this year or celebrating the harvest of this season. The opera is crowded with people, with the young excitedly squeezing to the "front of the stage."</p>

Old people with slightly blurred vision and impaired hearing have come, but they can't compete with the young people for watching the opera, so they simply sit under a tree or on a stone farther away from the "stage entrance" to chat with their old friends. Women, both pretty and ugly, except for the young widows who are more "private," mostly wear their most beloved clothes and shoes to show off. When they steal a glance at the "young men" looking at them on the "stage," they take out their handkerchiefs and twist them shyly. Children gather in groups, pushing past the waists of adults, rushing to the "small stalls under the stage." Everyone is so happy and energetic. From the "opening gong" to the "end of the show," it is late at night when they light their "lamps" and go home. The next afternoon, they follow the "opera troupe" to another neighboring village. Watching the opera so happily and energetically is their only entertainment! It is not until the "opera troupe" goes far away, fifteen or sixteen miles away, when they can't get home with a single candle after watching the opera, that they begin their field work or complete the winter storage as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Community opera was originally a ceremony to thank the gods and ancestors, but later it also became a kind of human affair. This meaning can be seen in the names "Temple Stage Opera" and "Open Stage Opera." The former is performed on a permanent or temporary stage in front of the main hall of a temple, while the latter is mostly performed in the open air in the wilderness. A shed is set up far in front of the stage to enshrine the gods, which is called "Shed Stage Opera," and the opera performed specifically for human affairs is called "Open Stage Opera."</p>
<p>Temple Stage Opera is performed regularly for the consecration of the Land God Hall, the City God Temple, and other temples, as well as the Wealth God Hall, Guan Yue Shrine, and other temples. Open Stage Opera is performed in early spring to pray for peace and prosperity, and in late autumn to thank the gods for a bountiful harvest, as well as to thank the gods for raising silkworms well, obtaining rain, and saving houses from burning down. More than ten years ago, when the rural economy was still relatively prosperous and farmers could still live in comfort, many human affairs operas were performed, such as when a certain clan's ancestral hall repaired its genealogy, or when a local gentry entered the ancestral hall, they performed operas to show their noble status and prosperous descendants. When someone had a son in old age or recovered from a serious illness, or on occasions such as longevity and promotion, they invited an opera troupe to sing a few operas to show their joy and generosity, and some were also sent as congratulatory performances by relatives and friends. A certain industry, such as plasterers, carpenters, tailors, and other groups, pooled their money to sing an opera, publicly set industry rules, and announced wage increases. Mountains, reed marshes, orchards, fruit orchards, etc., collected some money to sing an opera, publicly extended prohibitions, and agreed that "violators will be fined one opera and several seats of wine." The popularity of these Open Stage Operas not only paid tribute to gods and ancestors, but simply publicly called for entertainment from opera, and used it as a public gathering. Isn't that right, the farmers who work hard all year round need entertainment that can relax their muscles and spirits. As for whether this entertainment itself is toxic, or even after watching this opera, their spirit is oppressed by a certain surname or person, and their life is burdened, they have no time to consider these things.</p>
<p>An ordinary opera is eight acts, commonly known as the first four acts being the "main part" and the last four acts being the "addition." The main part is decided by the gentry and businessmen in the village and written on a water card hanging in front of the stage. The additions are decided by the youths of the village, who naturally choose what suits their tastes best. They don't like the gentlemen's love for the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and talented scholars and beauties. They love the battles and friendships of heroes and good men, and the flirtatious styles of men and women in "Little Cowherd" and "Drum Dance." The gentlemen pretend to be upright and don't watch the addition. A certain surname had a bit of a comical story about the opera when repairing their genealogy. Originally, the "team pullers" routinely took the opera list to ask the clan leader to choose the opera before the opening gong. However, the clan leader, who was older and of a higher generation, didn't know much about opera. Seeing "Cui Ping Mountain" on the opera list, he thought of the mountain directly opposite the ancestral hall, which was said to be related to feng shui, so he chose this opera to open the stage. Although someone discovered that this was problematic, they didn't dare to change it out of respect for the clan leader's face. When it came to the part where Pan Qiaoyun stole the monk Hai and teased Shi Xiu, the clan leader slipped away, and the youths chose obscene operas like Pan Jinlian. Afterwards, the surname was scolded for "performing an opera that shamed the ancestors" because they happened to be named Pan. Similar to this kind of performance related to surnames, it would often turn from a joke into a bloody tragedy. For example, the villages of the Qin, Luo, Cao, Yan, and Pan surnames each had agreements on which operas were allowed and not allowed. For example, Qin village would not perform "Luo Cheng Trapped in the Sand," but could only perform "Luo Tong Sweeping the North." Luo village would not choose "Qin Qiong Selling the Yellow Horse." If Pan village chose "Battle of Wancheng," "Slaying Cao Yi," or "Striking Yan Song," then the people of Cao and Yan villages would not only choose operas like "Capturing Pan Zhang Alive" or "Secret Trial of Pan Jiang" in retaliation, but would also make a ruckus in the opera, stop the performance, and beat anyone named Pan, thus forming a hereditary feud that would prevent intermarriage. This would turn from watching opera for entertainment to being angry and killing each other. However, the selection of operas for thanksgiving to the gods was much more solemn and rigid. For example, "Zhou Hu Achieving Enlightenment" and "Journey to the West" for consecration and temple fairs, "Wei River" and "Water Flooding Jinshan" for rain prayers, "Lady Leizu" for silkworm flower opera, and "Sitora献宝 [Siduoguo Xian Bao?]" for wealth god opera. As for human affairs operas, they mostly chose auspicious operas, such as "Nine Generations of Glory" for giving birth to a son and "killing a son" or "raccoon cat for a prince" for longevity, and avoided "Seven Stars Altar." After watching these old operas many times, the young audience would feel impatient and turn away to find opportunities to fight and make trouble to vent their anger.</p>
<p>Short-armor martial actors, clowns, dan (female) actors, and actors who did good work were the most popular. Everyone understood the mood of supporting an actor. When they were happy, they would throw fruit peels, sugar cane, and even stones onto the stage to express their dislike or appreciation for a certain character. Hua Xin and Cao Cao in "Xiaoyaojin" often got hit by stones.</p>

<h3 id="e263">The Apathy of "Oblomov" <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Mori Hara</p>
<p>"The True Story of Ah Q," a Chinese novel, is very famous because the apathy of "Ah Q" is hidden in every corner of the Chinese people, from the court to the farmhouse, there is an Ah Q guarding the place. Therefore, when the Chinese are bullied, massacred, or have several provinces seized, they are just like Ah Q, saying "The son beats the father" with a self-satisfied air, while hiding away.</p>
<p>Ah Q is quite formidable in China, but unfortunately, he has Oblomov as his companion.</p>
<p>What kind of person is Oblomov? What are the differences between Oblomov's apathy and Ah Q's apathy? Now let's delve into history, invite Mr. Oblomov out, so we can get to know him, which is both interesting and meaningful. Goncharov, a Russian writer contemporary with Dostoevsky, wrote a novel called Oblomov.</p>
<p>Oblomov is a Russian nobleman with six or seven hundred serfs and moderate wealth. In his early childhood, his creative talents were completely destroyed, and he only dreamed of the vast and tranquil noble manor on the beautiful banks of the Volga River, where there were no railways to disturb the peace of the manor, and the local residents had no "problems" to worry about. Oblomov was provided for by nannies, attendants, maids, and servants. He himself said, "Since I was a small child, have I ever put on my own socks?" Lunch was prepared at breakfast time, and he slept very early after lunch. Later, Oblomov entered university, with a loyal servant following him, and an atmosphere of laziness and sleepiness followed him as well. After listening to a few lectures, the fervent talks with other young friends at night and the vague yearning for ideals often stirred the young man's heart, but the gentleness of the manor and the influence of sleep, laziness, and the feeling of a stable and completely guaranteed life completely extinguished these positive and beautiful impressions. Other classmates were heated in their debates and joined various groups, but Oblomov only watched and asked himself, "What is this all for?" "Why do you want to bother yourself with these things?"</p>
<p>The author's description opens like this: Oblomov had been sleeping in his apartment for a long time, and he was still in bed; several times he wanted to get up, and several times he had already put his slippers on his feet, but after stopping to think for a moment, he shrank back into the quilt. His old servant stood by the bed with tea in his hand, and visitors came to invite him to participate in the annual May Day ride, but he said, "Why? Why should I look for these troubles and run around so hard?"</p>
<p>The pleasure of noble feelings was very close to Oblomov. Sometimes, he hated human vices, deception, sin, and suffering so much that his blood boiled, and he sat up from the bed with excitement, immediately wanting to turn this excitement into heroic deeds. But when the sun was setting, he would turn over and lie on his back again, everything calmed down, and he sadly watched the setting sun.</p>
<p>Moving house, in Oblomov's eyes, was very terrifying and strange, and he always wanted to delay it. His old servant said: "Others also have to move when necessary!"</p>
<p>This "others" annoyed Oblomov very much, and he scolded the old servant, saying:</p>
<p>"Do you know the meaning of the word 'others'?"</p>
<p>"The so-called 'others' are wild, uneducated people; poor and dirty, living in the attic, they can sleep on a carpet, and live on sweet potatoes and herring. Poverty forces them to run around – such people can of course move to their new home at any time. For example, that 甲埃夫, carrying his two shirts wrapped in a handkerchief, can run away. If you ask him, "Where are you going?" He will say, "I'm moving!" The meaning of "others" is like this – do you think I am one of these others?"</p>
<p>Oblomov also said a lot: "'Another person' is someone who polishes their own shoes, puts on their own clothes, ... buys their own things, makes their own fire, sweeps their own floor, and never knows what it means to use servants..." "Yes," the old servant replied, "there are many such people."</p>
<p>"That's right, but me, look, am I one of them?"</p>
<p>"No, young master is not like that at all..."</p>
<p>"Yes, I am indeed not like that! Do I run around everywhere? Do I work? Am I thin? Do I lack anything? I have never suffered from the cold or from hunger, I have never known what it is to lack anything – I have never worked for my own bread, nor have I done dirty work... Good, why do you dare compare me with those "others"?..." The old servant shed tears, and Oblomov said;</p>
<p>"Pull down the curtains, cover me with the quilt, don't let anyone disturb me, I want to sleep for a while, call me back for dinner later!"</p>
<p>Oblomov met a young girl, Olga, because women often like to do rescue work, she decided to save him, but to succeed in love and reach the point of marriage, he must strive to improve himself, break the laziness and monotony of life, but he really couldn't bear these, and Oblomov was frightened back. He finally returned to his Oblomov kingdom, his sofa and his slippers, and Olga left him in disappointment.</p>
<p>After this novel was published in 1859, people all over Russia competed to read and discuss "Oblomovism". Everyone discovered that between himself and Oblomov, there were always some similar conditions. And thousands of young people loved Olga, and her favorite song "Casta Diva" also became their favorite tune.</p>
<p>In the current Soviet Union, especially during the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, in factories, collective farms, and schools, in addition to the Lenin Medal, a kind of "Oblomov Medal" is also popular.</p>
<p>Why is Oblomov still commemorated in the current Soviet Union? Are all the workers in the Five-Year Plan close to Oblomov?</p>
<p>That would be a joke, assuming that the implementers of the Five-Year Plan are close to Oblomov. It is definitely not like this, it is just a punishment, an insult, for a small number of those who do not work hard, just like drawing a turtle and pasting it in the position of a slow worker.</p>
<p>Oblomov represents the degeneration of will, laziness as morality, and conservatism, contempt for passionate activity, etc., a typical character produced under the serf system, but this kind of character has not completely died out in the big world even now. But the serf system is not the only reason for the production of this type; the era of affluence and capital production makes this type never disappear among us.</p>
<p>Oblomov is an ordinary type, a conservative and comfortable type. When a person's life is slightly affluent, he is unwilling to have any changes or to start new businesses, because that will only bring him a lot of unpleasantness and trouble.</p>
<p>He avoids the trouble of planning industries, he does not know what obligatory work is, what the labor of farmers is, when to plant, when to harvest. When thinking of rural life, he only thinks of beautiful gardens, picnics in the forest, and idyllic walks with a beautiful and plump wife; how and why property came into his hands, why so many people work hard for him alone, these have not bothered his mind.</p>
<p>Among intellectuals, in society, and in personal life, even now, there are still many, many Oblomovs. For example, in the intellectual world, when they encounter a new idea or proposition, they become uneasy, doubting the reform of society, and a slight mention of change frightens them, and love frightens them as well.</p>
<p>In great China, there are especially many Oblomovs, even to the point where a person possesses both Ah Q and Oblomov characteristics. However, there is a slight difference here. Oblomovs are all upper-class wealthy classes. The New Life Movement has no impact on the Oblomovs. They are fundamentally afraid of "new," afraid of "movement," and even more afraid of "exercise." If Ah Q changed his mind, and instead of offering his right cheek when someone slapped his left, he raised his fist, then the Oblomovs would disappear, right?</p>
<p>If a detailed statistic were to be made now, investigating all the Ah Qs and Oblomovs in the country, and then making an Ah Q medal and an Oblomov medal, and awarding them separately, this kind of New Life Movement would be very unique indeed.</p>

<p>— Yu Ji</p>
<p>The wheat seedlings are gone, the willow branches are full of tender buds.</p>
<p>The bell in the bottom of the dipper rings busily in the fields, and people are sowing sorghum in a timely manner.</p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p>To buy fertilizer, one must skimp on cooking oil and salt,</p>
<p>To plant sorghum, one cannot vaccinate children; how dare one not plant when it's time to plant? – It is a difficult time, but also a rare time. XXX</p>
<p>People shake the 　, horses pull, the earth lies steadily beneath their feet, sowing the seeds of hope. Who knows what kind of sprouts will grow? XXX</p>
<p>Shaking the 　, talking about life, the thoughts in their minds sprout wildly like grass. "Maybe there won't be locusts this year?" "Can the price of grain still rise?" "The year before last, every liter of sorghum cost one thousand five," "Last year, it could still sell for a thousand," "Right now – spring is already deep," "One liter only sells for four hundred eight!" XXX</p>
<p>The earth lies quietly waiting for people to sow, the sun warmly watches the seeds sprout, but people sow the seeds with perplexity.</p>
