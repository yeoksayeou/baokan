<p>時評</p>
<h3>讀儲蓄銀行法後桐</h3>
<p>近年我國之關於金融業法規略具規模者。當推二十年二月二十八日立法院通過之銀行法。顧以其窒碍之處尙多。雖經通過。而迄未見諸施也。惟比年以來。我國普通銀行之兼營儲蓄業務者比比皆是。而風氣所趨。循至普通商店如百貨公司藥房等。亦多兼營儲蓄。其濫溢情况。於斯爲極。民國二十年春。財政部曾下令取締。一方對於素處放任自由情境中之兼營銀行。亦採取漸進式監督策。而其時國内之渴望政府頒布儲蓄銀行法規之呼聲。亦日漸高昻。良以儲蓄銀行之業務。其關係於社會者深且切。故儲蓄銀行法規訂立之重要。較普通銀行爲尤甚。蓋普通銀行與社會之關係。大都直接於工商業者。而儲蓄銀行與社會之關係。大都直接發生於下層階級。在各國均有訂定特别法規之先例我國今日之所謂普通銀行法規。内容旣尙不完全。而於儲蓄銀行法規且付缺如。至淸代之儲蓄銀行條例。揆與今日之實際情形。早不能符合適用矣。</p>
<p>民國二十年三月。不侫乘財部謀設法取締商店兼營儲蓄之機且鑒於其時各銀行之兼營儲蓄者。均未有明確之規程。乃於「取締商店兼營儲蓄誌感」一文中。卽力主當局應鑒於此類事實發生之前車。以後凡對於銀行之兼辦儲蓄業務者。亦宜從嚴規定。曾謂「凡欲兼辦儲蓄之銀行。必須於銀行註册而外。另行劃開資本。另訂章程。聲明由各董事經副理負完全無限責任。而其投資方法。以及資產負債之賬目。尤應按期呈報政府。並向社會公開。方可核准共辦理。不能以有限公司名義之銀行。收受應負無限責任之儲蓄存欵。至外國註册之公司。必須重向中國政府主管機關註册。否則不能承認其爲有限公司。」最近自馬寅初氏於全國財政會議席上。提議取締有奬儲蓄機關後。政府亦鑒於儲蓄銀行法有亟待頒布之必要。乃於六月二十二日由立法院修正儲蓄銀行法草案十七條。加以通過。按儲蓄銀行法規。在先進各邦。其主要規定之可舉者。爲（一）限制儲蓄銀行之名稱。不得濫用。（二）業務應有規定。（三）資本宜有限度。（四）經營應加限制。（五）放欵之方法及數額。均有限制（六）不能任意變更章程。（七）董監負無限責任。（八）嚴定罰則。（九）營業公開，凡此皆所以謀儲蓄銀行業務之穩健。及一般社會經濟这保障。美國儲蓄銀行鼻祖亨利鄧肯氏。謂「儲蓄乃以零星之欵。用自助之方法。依照穩妥與利殖之原則。以備緩急之需。」又美國儲蓄銀行專家尼芬氏。謂「利率这重視。無論如何。必較遜於本金。雖利子之日積月累。其數量亦甚可觀。但儲蓄究不在利子之積聚。而爲本金之累積也。」觀乎此可知辦理儲蓄業務之最要鐵則。在以自助方法。謀穩妥之利殖。及重視本金之安全。而不應以競逐高利爲務也。　　查新儲蓄銀行法全部十七條。包含鉅細。立論週詳。在原則及實際上允爲適全精當。尤以第七條規定資金之運用方法。其七八兩項之對於農村合作社之質押放欵。及以農產物爲質之放欵。處今日社會經濟凋敝農村情况惡化之際。誠最扼要。其第十二條及第十五條。對於儲蓄銀行之董事監察人。不憚一再確定其責任。此於今日猶有少數辦理儲蓄之金融機關。於其規章中。仍希圖避卸責任。不加明定者。可謂一大棒喝也。惟該法第一條意似微嫌含混輒依鄙意。擬分爲第一第二兩條如下。</p>
<p>第一條經營左列各項業務者爲儲蓄銀行。</p>
<p>（一）以複利方法計算利息之存欵。</p>
<p>（二）一次存入不滿十元之不定期存欵。但總額不得超過○○元以上　　（三）零存整付之定期存欵。但每次存欵。數不得超過○○元以上。</p>
<p>（四）整存零付之定期存欵。但一次存欵數不得超過○○元以上。</p>
<p>第二條合於第一條之規定。而不稱儲蓄銀行</p>
<p>第一條各項之數額限制。係就第五條中各項規定。移註於第一條。似易明瞭。則第五條可無需另列。同時第四條即可改擬如下。</p>
<p>第○條儲蓄銀行除第一條規定各項業務外。得兼營左列業務。</p>
<p>（一）保管業務。</p>
<p>（二）代收欵項及匯兌。</p>
<p>（三）代理買賣有價證券。</p>
<p>（四）公益團體及合作社之欵項收付。</p>
<p>（五）公益團體及合作社之通知存欵。</p>
<p>關於有奬儲蓄之禁止。亦爲該法特點之一。據馬寅初氏之談話謂該法可望於七月中實行。至實行之能否不成問題。今姑置不論。但實行後一方關於有奬儲蓄機關。應先定取締辦法。不然，中外待遇。不平孰甚。且此項機關。設任其滋長。將來積重難返。取締必更不易。而與今次頒佈儲蓄銀行法之本意。大相北謬矣。</p>

<h3>政友會又分裂　鈴木總裁拒絶入閣　惟床次派主張參加</h3>

<p>（東京）政友會鈴木總裁、因長老會决議一任善處對政府態度、七日上午九時訪問岡田首相於組閣本部、告以政友會决定採取是是非非主義、不派黨員入閣會議僅五分鐘卽辭出、（七日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）政友會六日晚開長老會議、討論對於岡田内閣應取如何態度問題、會議因各長老不願送員八蔑視政黨之内閣、主張採取是是非非主義、不援助新内閣討論至深夜、結果决定將此問題一任鈴木總裁解决、會議乃散、床次於長老會開會之前、會見岡田首相特派密使前鐵道省工務局長賀山、因賀山極力懇請床次入閣、就任遞信大臣、遂以政友會占閣内三席爲條件、同意入閣故床次在長老會席上主張援助内閣、但如政友會果然採取是是非非態度、則床次不得不脫離黨藉、然則床次派及與床次有關係之人物亦同時退出政友會、由此觀之、如鈴木總裁不認援助内閣說、則政友會將必分裂、床次竹二郎對記者曰、六日晨後藤前農相代表岡田首相來訪、請求援助新閣余乃答以政府表示诚意、並增加政友會閣員數、則可允入閣、後來政友會長老會開會前、岡田首相派密使來、謂新内閣組閣方針、决定政友會閣員三、民政黨閣員二、余因岡田首相接受余之提議、允諾入閣、長老會度上大多數意見、希望與内閣絶緣、然余獨主張援助内閣、舉國一致應付現下嚴重時局、會議之結果、决定一任總裁善處、但臨散會時余對諸人聲明、堅持自己竟見、故兩說對立尙未解决、（七日日聯電）</p>

<h3>日内閣改組與海軍會議前途</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）此間海軍方面以爲日本内閣因政治問題而難於產生、或將使海軍軍縮預備會議展緩開會、海軍觀察者以爲此項會議、不如暫行停止、俟東京方面空氣澄淸之後、日本可以正式决定其政策、然後再開亦不爲遲、現在岡田首相之不能迅速組成内閣、已使英美代表在倫敦之交涉無形延宕、因兩國代表在日本代表未抵倫敦之前、對於日本建議萬難有何正式决定也、前衆院海軍委員會主席民主黨議員布立頓、曾向美聯社表示、謂日本如堅持廢止現有海軍比率、則美國將實</p>
<p>實行在太平洋中美屬各島設置海軍及空軍之保護根據地云、布氏謂日本官塲近來屢次聲明將於明年海軍會議中要求擴大海軍、若然、則美國將以在進行獨立中之菲律濱羣島、亦擬一併增加軍備、美國在菲律濱之陸軍根據地、將於獨立時放棄、惟羅斯福總統曾言、海軍根據地須俟美國政府與菲島政府成立雙方滿意之條件、方能最後决定、布氏以爲日本要求擴大海軍、並無明確之理由、最近日本雖佔據滿洲、然中國海軍並無威脅日本之力量、而數年以來、日本海軍對於他國之比率、亦非常適當、是則彼之要求、無非欲於太平洋中稱覇而已、日本旣有此意、他國自宜加以提防、以免與滿洲同樣之事件、亦在他國領土發生、菲島關島及檀香山等處、皆最易受日本軍閥主義之蹂躪、故日本爲堅持其海軍政策、此等地域、皆宜妥　保護、并且現由日本代管之太平洋各島、亦宜移交美國或其他國家管理、現在海軍國家已開始預備會議、太平洋之政治局勢、對於海軍比率問題、當大有影響、英美兩國預料皆將反對日本之擴大要求、至於各國與日本成立新約之說、布氏以爲五年以來、日本視各種條約如廢紙、彼之不顧一切、摧殘中國人民之生命財產、卽爲最顯著之實例云、（六日國民電）</p>

<p>布哈勒斯政治觀察者咸信羅馬尼亞現正努力改革軍備、此可於鐵杜樓斯哥政府另設軍備部一點見之、軍備部雖與陸軍部密切合作、但各自爲政、不受陸軍部之束縛、此外足以表示此種趨勢者、則爲軍備部長安哥拉斯哥之出游、及近來法國貝丁將軍之訪問羅京、官方雖稱貝丁將軍之來訪、純屬私人性質、惟一般人仍認二人活動之眞正理由、爲實現羅馬尼亞陸軍部數年前擬就之軍備計劃、該項計劃之延宕實行、實由於財力不足之故、羅馬尼亞財政現已山窮水盡、國家銀行亦無巨欵資助此項計劃、故惟有外力是賴耳、現在謠傳此項奥援不久可至、關於此事至今雖無可靠消息、但傳聞克魯沙許特爾兵工廠已允以鉅欵借給羅馬尼亞、此適與法國資助其東方同盟國之政策相脗合、羅馬尼亞陸軍部無欵維持常備軍已成公開之秘密、過去數年中若干軍隊時有三分之一甚或二分之一之士兵遣歸就食、遣歸之時期長短不等、故處此環境之下缺乏經費以改革軍備彰彰明甚、以前亦曾向公衆募欵、例如三年前之特别空軍基金、卽其一端、聞十二月中已募集一萬萬二千八百萬羅幣云、募捐事宜仍在進行、但飛機則未見增加、傳聞此項經費已移作别用云、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>波羅的各國聯盟運動成敗　關鍵在立陶宛波蘭之關係</h3>
<p>羅伐爾愛沙尼亞之外交政策久已主張與立陶宛及拉脫維亞締結同盟、然此種努力、至今祇有一部份成功、卽拉脫維亞雖已與愛沙尼亞成立同盟、規定兩國之共同外交政策、然立陶宛至今尙未加入、此間認爲長此以往、波羅的各國之合作將永不可能、立陶宛所以獨異之理由、係因愛沙尼亞及拉脫維亞主張波羅的集團應與波蘭合作、但自一九二○年波軍佔據維爾那地方以來、立陶宛與波蘭之衝突卽驟趨緊張、自茲以後、兩國卽入於備戰狀態、兩國交界斷絶交通及商業關係、並均派重兵駐守、立陶宛以爲自兩國恢復外交及經濟關係以來、國民公意迄在防止戰爭之實現、此可視爲立陶宛放棄維爾那之象徵、但立陶宛以外之波羅的外交家咸信僅與波蘭合作、已足保障波羅的各國之利益、據稱、各國與蘇俄締結之不侵略公約、在波羅的各國之安全方面、甚有成效、但波蘭領導之波羅的各國之區間集團更有價値、故主要之問題、在緩和立陶宛與波蘭之敵視、愛沙尼亞現正努力促成此舉、愛沙尼亞外長席爾桀曼最近訪問華沙、而波蘭前總理施拉威克亦率領政治代表團親赴羅伐爾報聘、均曾提及波蘭與立陶宛國交問題、並悉愛沙尼亞自告奮勇出任斡旋、據稱和解辦法先在潛行消弭備戰狀態、然後再恢復兩國之商務及國交、茲悉和解之機運較前爲佳、一因立陶宛愛沙尼亞及拉脫維亞均已廢止國會制度、據稱相同之内政、實有利於外交問題之諒解、二因國社黨在美米爾活動甚力、因此立陶宛與德國之邦交緊張、故立陶宛似願變更其對波態度云、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>智利嚴防革命</h3>

<h3>舊金山工潮嚴重加州防軍出動</h3>

<p>（華盛頓）美國公務人員對于早日恢復去年實行緊縮政策所减去之百分之五俸給所存希望、今日已被打破、因羅斯福總統已正式命令於六個月内暫緩恢復云、此項命令今日已在白宫宣布、係經總統於好斯頓號巡艦中用無綫電傳達、查公務人員被减之俸給、共計百分之十五、數月前曾恢復百分之五、後復於六月卅日恢復百分之五云、（六日國民電）</p>

<h3>日本齋藤内閣解體（日本通信）　齋藤辭職後繼任人選困難　經商討結果岡田啟介拜命</h3>
<p>齋藤内閣屢次更換閣員、陸長·海長·外長·商工·都更換過、特别是更迭敎長時、惹出的問題更大、竟至於無法正式找出繼任的人、不艃已而由齋藤實首相自兼、這確是一件最苦的事、也是日本政治史上最醜惡的事、財政部次長受賄案、牽涉的不止他個人、還有銀行局長在内、是日本貪污案中的一件很大的案子、假如這件案子不致於再行擴大的話、那末齋藤内閣仍舊相勉强繼續着、因爲這不單是齋藤個人的事、也不能說齋藤戀棧、而是元老方面想支持立憲政治、想借海軍關係、擋一擋陸軍的盲目政策、緩和軍閥政治的抬頭、所以盡可能的支援齋藤内閣、但是一般日本人對齋藤内閣確已厭倦了、絶不願他再作下去了、所以黑田案發生以後、輿論卽一致消極的咀咒他、同時黑田受賄案又擴大而至於牽入前商工大臣中島久萬吉、於是齋藤内閣不能不倒了、但是後任人選却是非常難得、據一般推測、約有以下諸人、有資格拜命組閣、</p>
<p>第一個爲人所屬望的是朝鮮總督字垣一成、他是田中義一的繼承者、是陸軍方面的政治人物、雖然他常自稱是一介武弁，而在民政黨·在財閥·在貴族院·都有很多人對他表示好感、可是軍部方面、特别是陸軍的中級幹部對他不好、海軍也受影響、所以坂野海軍普及委員長發了不反對宇垣組閣的聲明、立卽撤職、在另自一方面他們却作擁護平沼的運動、來抵制宇垣、</p>
<p>第二要算平沼比較有望了、因爲他旣得到軍部的擁護、他自己又有國本社以下的右傾諸團體作羣衆基礎、軍民眞正聯合起來、豈不是所向無敵麽、不過我們知道日本到底是一個帶有極其濃厚封建性的國家、而財政資本又很發達、政黨雖然實力减低了、可是財閥依舊有力、他們還有力量主張他們自己的利益、絶不能讓軍人太軼出範圍、何况元老西園寺公望、又是憲政常道論者、尤其不肯完全不要憲法、所以平沼組阁閣所遇到的暗礁、并不比宇垣小些、</p>
<p>第三就是比較中和的人物淸浦奎吾了、在政治上他確能表示其超然的態度、不偏於法西斯、也不偏於政黨的私利、而其德望也極一時之選、使軍部方面的人不能反對、又能够兼具宇垣與平沼之長、而融和軍部與政黨間對立的僵局、所以許多人都以爲齋藤内閣倒台後、該由淸浦出台、但是淸浦年紀太老了、的確是不能勝任煩劇、他本人也堅决表示不能就任、那未淸浦内閣也難成事實、</p>
<p>次於淸浦的人、是現任樞密院議長一木喜德郎、他在現代日本政治人物中是超越的人材、在軍部與元老雙方都有好感如果一木登台的話、則政民兩黨、更容易調和、所謂聯合内閣也容易成立、因爲政黨内閣、無論政友會具有議會的絶對多數、但無法控制政局、鈴木的信譽也很低微、所以除了聯合民政黨組閣外、單獨一黨組閣絶無實現的可能、於是祇好多方拉攏、圖維持現狀、殊不知一木旣就任樞密院議長、短時期内、他自己與元老方面都不肯發生變動、</p>
<p>最後祇有使齋藤再次組閣爲較妥了、然而財長的責任問題、紀綱問題等等、都是根本上的矛盾、而齋藤内閣又不能不延長、結果在海軍界選出了閊田啟介大將來代替齋藤、事實上比以上諸人好像是適黨些、也足以維持着現政局、不讓引起過於激劇的變化、（七月四日於東京）</p>

<p>（訂立公約）滬津航運合作試辦收效後、各輪船公司、决繼續辦理、並於昨日下午十時、在廣東路九十三號航運俱樂部開會、到國營招商局·民營政記·三北·肇興·等代表伍德鄰·王伯芬·虞順懋·等對於草擬之滬津航運公約及附件、均詳加討論修正、决俟秘書將修正公文原文及附件整理後、再定期開會正式簽訂、</p>

<h3>樓桐孫抵滬談長汀一月内可收復</h3>
<p>新聲社云、贛粤閩浙鄂剿匪軍東路總司令部秘書長樓桐孫氏、於上月底、由閩邊軍次因公北返、抵滬後、復赴杭公幹、昨日由杭來滬、新聲社記者往謁於萬次、詢以最近剿匪實况、茲分誌其談話如下、</p>
<p>（匪區日蹙僅餘九縣）樓氏略謂、自去年蔣委員長在廬山、辦理軍官訓練團、實行第五次圍剿、穩紮穩打、步步爲營、風氣旣已轉移、肅淸確具勝算、試觀此年餘以來、各路國軍、有進無退、有勝無敗、截至目前爲止、土匪在閩贛邊界所佔區域、已僅餘歸化·淸流·寗化·長汀·（屬閩）石城·瑞金·興國·　都·會昌（屬贛）等九縣、且在四路大軍包圍之中、眞如釜底游魚、斷難漏網、乃外間不明眞相、惑於謠言、對於剿匪軍情、尙不無抱有憂疑者、可謂完全錯誤、此新聞界所應特加注意也、</p>
<p>（一個月後可復長汀）即就東路軍方面而言、自閩北之泰寗·建寗·閩西之永安·連城·相繼克復、歸化·淸流·之匪、已在東路軍三百包圍之中、現國軍前鋒、距汀不過數十里、預定在上個月後、長汀必可恢復、</p>
<p>（封鎖嚴密匪甚恐慌）匪軍因受我軍步進逼、嚴密封鎖、早已精疲力竭、恐慌異常、最近匪首失德親駐長汀督修工事、並强徵壯丁、補充傷亡、已可槪知、匪中食鹽、每元祇售二三兩、匪兵每日祇發米半斤、彈藥來源、亦經斷絶、危困情形、尤可想見、故匪軍戰略、重在「游擊」與「突破」、以作困獸之鬥、但我着着嚴防、以靜制動、土匪斷難倖遑、</p>
<p>（閩南社會漸復繁榮）閩南治安、蔣總司令亦極爲關心、分别剿撫、近已甚形安謐、社會狀况、漸復繁榮、聞樓氏不日赴京、並將轉贛一行、有所報告云、</p>

<p>本月四日曾論過主觀眞理與客觀眞理的問題，與這問題互相關聯的，還有相對眞理與絶對眞理的問題。這問題在很多哲學書上雖然常常提到、但大都只是說出了結論而忽略了解釋，所以許多讀者對這問題的解决不明瞭其所以然，常常來信問到。因爲疑惑的人很多，所以我們必須作公開的答覆。</p>
<p>這問題的中心是；在現代最進步的哲學裏，認爲絶對眞理是相對眞理的總和，其理由何在？</p>
<p>在舊的哲學裏、相對眞理與絶對眞理是對立而不能相容的；眞理是相對的時，便不是絶對的，是絶對的時，便不是相對的。因爲相對的眞理因時因地因人而不同、絕對的眞理則是</p>
<p>永久普遍的眞理。前者常常變易，而後者却不變不易。變易的和不變的當然是不能相容的，所以法國的實證哲學者孔德主張相對眞理，於所以法國的實證哲學者孔德主張相對眞理，於是就不承認有絶對眞理。而主張有絶對眞理的新康德主義者，又不承認有所謂相對眞理。相對眞理與絶對眞理的對立、在舊哲學史上是很嚴格的。</p>
<p>要解决這個問題、我們覺得要問一問；眞理是什麽？眞理是客觀現實在人類頭腦中的反映，换言之，眞理必須能反映外界事的本身，「人皆有死」是眞理，因爲事實上凡人都果然是會死的緣故。如果事實上人不會死而我們偏要說「人皆有死」，那就不成其爲眞理了。這樣，眞理是反映在人類頭腦中的客觀事物。但人類的觀察力是有限的，一切事物不會同時一起反映進人類的頭腦中。人類的認識眞理，只能先在他自己所能體騐到的事物上做起，更確切地說，只能在他實踐的範圍内看是眞理。而他的實踐的範圍，又因着他所處的社會狀態而有所不同。例如在原始的狩獵民族中，人類的生活飄流不定，他們所看見的「死」的現象，幾乎都是受傷出血的死，自然的死，在他們是極少見的，所以他們的死的觀念就與我們不同。他們認爲出血的死就是眞的死，而自然的死，在他們看來只是等於睡眠。這樣、在原始狩獵民族的頭腦中所反映的死的眞理，是與他們的實踐相對的，是不完全的眞理。而由這一個例了裏，我們就可以知道，眞理是受人類的實踐所限制的相對的眞理。</p>
<p>但相對眞理旣是眞理，它必得也是事物的眞實的反映，所以並不像主張只有絶對眞理的人所說似的毫無眞理價値，它只是不完全而已。「出血而死」是狩獵人的唯一的死的觀念，但這種觀念在我們現代人的死的觀念中也未嘗不可以適用，不過現代人死的内容更豐富更完全，不但有出血的死，還有病死，老死等。我們的生活實踐中比狩獵人看到更多的死的形態，所以我們有更完全的死的眞理。或者可以說，我們所知道的死，是絶對的眞理，而狩獵人的死則是相對的眞理，因爲狩獵人只相對着出血的一件事才承認是死，而我們則知道「人皆有死」。（未完）</p>

<h3>世界業餘網球霸權易手潘萊獲惠勃爾登冠軍　男直落三擊敗上屆冠軍克勞福　男二十五年來英人第一次得錦標　男女雙打皆到達决賽</h3>
<p>（倫敦六日電）英國潘萊今日以直落三擊敗澳洲克勞福、奪得惠勃爾登網球大會男子單打冠軍、比數爲六比三、六比○、七比五、</p>
<p>英人之得惠勃爾登冠軍、尙遠在一九○七年、今相隔二十五載、潘萊再得錦標、連已得之全美及澳洲兩錦標在内、潘萊爲目下全世界業餘網球这冠軍、毫無疑問、最可奇異者、此三項錦標、决賽中、皆擊敗克勞福也、</p>
<h3>潘萊連勝十三局</h3>
<p>第一盤潘萊表演極驚人之球術、擊敗冠軍保持者克勞福、不勝容易、比賽僅六十五分鐘即畢事、克勞福初甚穩健、第一盤中、以三比一居先、在極度驚人之狀態下、潘萊在此時、竟一連串獲十三局之多、反以六比三勝第一盤、六比零勝第二盤、復以一比零、在第三盤中居先、第一盤之第四局、潘萊以○丨四十（○比三）落後時、突發三記無還價之反手球、轉敗爲勝、第一盤僅二十五分鐘即畢事、</p>
<h3>五官之外有六官</h3>
<p>第二盤在第二盤中、潘萊完全將克勞福制服、五官之外、似乎有第六官之知覺、能預知克勞福之一舉一動、而將克迫入重重疊疊之錯誤、一記而得分者尤無數、第二盤僅十分鐘即畢、</p>

<p>兒童周刋大家預備怎樣過暑假？  林蔭　　小朋友，暑期已到了，你們預備怎樣度過呢？要是大家把它認爲是假期，假期裏是應該遊玩的，那就大錯特錯了！　　你們不要以爲舊書已經讀完了，新書要到秋季開學時才發，這時期中好像没有什麽事可做。儘可玩個暢快。要知道，書是讀不完的，雖然是讀過的舊書，也能够得着新知識可以有進步。孔子所說「温故而知新」的話，就是這個意思。而且，倘若你把功課丢在一邊，一天到晚玩着，等到秋季開學的時候，學問就會大大的退步了！　　因此，在這長長的假期來臨的時候，我誠懇的要求小朋友們，自己預先規定一個暑期工作計劃，才不會把光陰輕易的放過。我覺得下列的兩項工作，也可以供獻給大家作爲參考；（一）温習舊的功課。或進暑期補習學校，使功課不荒疎，學識有進步。（二）帮助隣居或自己家裏不識字的人。（無論大小）識字寫字，這件工和，不但是應用自己的能力。和實習自己的學問，而且還替社會普及敎育啊！不過，重在實行，希望小朋友們能始終如一的努力，勿間斷，勿虎頭蛇尾，向前努力呀！愛迪生的小時候  劉中希　　小朋友們！你們知道美國有一位偉大的發明家愛迪生，他小時候只讀了三個多月的書，先生常駡他是一個不可敎的孩子，後來他退了學，便在地窖裏做起實騐室來，收集空瓶二百多個，把買糖菓的錢省下來去買代學藥品，不够便去賣報紙掙錢，整天的在地窖裏實騐化學，不明白的地方便問别人，别的功課由他母親指導。後來他到火車上去販賣報紙，竟在火車的行李室裏做起實騐室來，有一天火車忽然出軌，因爲振動太厲害了，把他放在檯上的化學藥品都震倒在地上，便燃燒起來，守車的人看見了很是受氣，走上去打了他一下耳光，竟把耳膜都条聾了，使他一直聾到老，他吃了一個耳光並不憤怒，反說使他不致分心。後來他搬到自己家裏去，繼續的實騐化學，結果便是一位偉大的發明家，他自己也說「他的成功是從辛苦恒心中得來的哩！」運動歌  何其憨　　起來呀！朋友們！　　運動！運動！　　在微熹的早晨，　　我們早些兒起身；　　抖擻起我們的精神，　　使着勁兒運動；　　强國必先强身，　　强身只有運動！　　起來呀！　　朋友們！　　運動！運動！　　替我們國家强種！爲什麽冰放在上面？  篤心　　爲了防止食物的腐化，因此敏兒的爸爸買了一隻冰箱來，敏兒從没有看見過冰箱，因此，好奇的看了一回，後來他對爸爸說；　　「爸爸，這隻氷箱大槪是不好的吧，丨氷放在上面，和食物有什麽關係呢？」　　爸聽了笑笑的說「敏兒你不知道這個道理呢，現在讓我來告訴你吧，食物放在就氷箱裏不腐化的原因，就是因爲空氣很冷。空氣冷的是向下的，因此，我們要把氷放在上面，使空氣冷了向下流，假使如你的話，丨氷放在下面，那麽，食物在上面受不到氷空氣以後，不是仍要腐化嗎？因此氷是要放在上面的。」我所喜歡的書  伯眞　　好奇心的我，時常聽得敎師講；ＸＸ物體和ＸＸ液體混合後，便成了ＸＸ東西。ＸＸ氣體和ＸＸ混合後，便變成了ＸＸ，我覺得這種學問，眞是奇怪。　　我也知道科學在人們的衣，食、住，及日常生活中，佔着很重要的地位，並且將來的世界，也定是一個科學極端發達的世界。　　我於是東去打聽，西去詢問；舊書攤上去找尋，有没有適合我程度的淺近的科學書籍。買到了手就看，不管費掉多少金錢，不管耗去多少光陰。　　每逢休假的日子，在幽靜的地方，津津有味的在看科學的書籍，差不多有時中飯也會忘掉去吃的！　　我預測將來的世界，一定不是一個平凡的世界。現在科學已經很發達了。那麽將來呢？科學一定更發達。　　將來没有科學智識的人，我以爲一定不能立足在社會上，不能在社會上立足，一定要淘汰！滅亡！　　小朋友們！努力！努力！趕快在科學上用功夫吧！不要到將來懊悔「少壯不努力！老大徒傷悲！」啊。勸小朋友莫學頑皮  揚子江　　頑皮的孩子雖也可以做大事，成大業，歷史上雖也不乏大人物是頑皮孩子出身的實例，然而我總覺得，頑皮决不是一種値得讚美的行爲。大人物的孩童時期都頑皮，祗是說明了他的個性强，有作爲；而以後的成就，也還是要靠自身的修養，父兄師友的陶冶，以及環境給予他，艱苦的鍜鍊。如果靠了單純的頑皮，則其毫無前途，當可斷言。自然也談不到成爲大人物了。　　前天經過北四川路，頭上忽然洒了點水下來，抬頭一看，見是一家日本店裏的日本孩子在陽台上吐了一口水，看見我立定，便縮進裏面去了。在半月之前，鄰近日本小孩因摔泥塊到我們後樓，給房東去告訴了他們的家長，因此而遭小孩懷恨在心，便把後門上的斯撥靈鎖用柏油攪了爛泥來弄壞了。我覺得，日本小孩普遍的頑皮，和他們今日之成爲世界所側目的侵略民族，是有着深切的關係的因爲他們在孩童時期便頑皮慣了。我希望中國的小朋友們不要染到他們的那種惡習性。　　蔣委員長提倡的新生活運動，首先呌人淸潔規矩，頑皮當然是規矩的敵對，希望小朋友們能一致的捨棄它！努力加餐　　上期亦菴君所作「努力加餐」一圖，因製版略小，所註菜肴之名，糢糊不明，茲特放大如上。小能制大  章南邨　　螞蟻是很小的動物，牠合起羣來，　能將比牠大的蟲類，圍殺找着去吃，這是我們常可見到的，還有種小魚，能吃渡水的牛，以及種種大的東西，不是奇怪嗎？　　這小魚名呌里布，產亞馬　地方大河中，具有銳利的三角齒，不過一尺五寸的長，只要有幾尾魚將動物的血咬出，就有千萬成羣的同類，集合包圍，這裏一口，那裏一口，一整個的大動物，盡變成這無數的里布小魚食料。　　亞馬素大河中，因爲有這厲害的小魚，這地方的人，都不敢在這河中洗澡，倘若洗澡時候遇着，卽或不被咬死，也要受着重傷。　　這樣看來，日本蕞爾小國，併我屬國朝鮮，割我臺灣，無故侵佔我東北四省，昨步進尺，想制我死命，我國有三千五百萬方里的土地，有四萬萬的人民，受制於這種么麽小醜之下，也就同里布小魚，小能制大了。　　里布小魚，能够以小制大，是有合羣的效果，日本敢於這樣猖獗，不過也是多够合羣，我國如果大家戮力同心，合起羣來，以大制小，並不是什麽難事啊！小朋友，你看，合羣不是很要緊的嗎？農村小友的通問  子明　　　螢火蟲　　　　親愛的小朋友；夜幕籠罩了大地，萬俱俱寂，一切動物，大槪都到睡鄉裏去了。但靑蛙蝦蟆閣吵得怪熱閙的。　　淸風輕輕地吹來，送着「凉爽」到達人間。天上的月亮，笑嘻嘻地對着衆星們誇耀光明；那地上草叢裏的螢火蟲，憤憤地鑽出來，在尾巴上也放射出光亮來飛到東飛到西，很是得意。　　「火螢郎夜夜紅，婆婆織布，公公挑水。」朋友，這歌謠是什麽意思呢？是說我們農村裏是很忙的，連老年人都要帶做生活，可見壯年人的一般了。所以此地有句諺語；「田鷄閣閣呌，要請工人萬人轎。」農友的忙碌，在一年之中以這時爲最了。　　再說那一閃一閃的螢蟲，它自己並不以爲光小而不亮；但它喜歡集羣，細小的害蟲，往往就被它們殺掉，它是益蟲，却有許多小月友，用着蒲扇去捉它；實在可惜失很！　　朋友！我有一個妄想；一個小小的蟲，尙能發出光亮來，如果，人類依照它的比例，放起光明來，豈不是世界上永遠没有黑暗了嗎？賣冰的小孩  閻重樓　　「賣冰呀！····賣冰。」　　這是九歲孩子蘇的聲音，這聲音喊得怪響的，差不多地走到的地方每個人都能聽見。　　蘇是一個貧家的孩子，他父親做小工，他母親給人家帮傭，他自己因爲也要吃飯，所以在這夏天，他便想到這項賣冰的生意；他想從這賣冰的生意中賺幾文錢。　　太陽像火傘一樣高張在空中，把柏油的馬路曝得鬆軟；蘇走在濕熱的馬中上，頭上頂着太陽，汗珠像雨點子滴下來；他口渴得很！但是他不敢把自己籃子裏的冰拿出一小塊來解渴，他怕他少了一文的收入，便要餓肚皮！　　他從學校門外走過，看見許多小學生在通風的敎室中讀書；他從公園門外走過，看見許多小朋友在樹蔭下游戲；他心裏眞是羨慕得甚麽似的，但他却是一個貧家的孩了喲！　　儘管天氣是多麽的炎熱，儘管道路是多麽的難行；但蘇爲了維持他的生命，仍舊背着籃，流着汗，口裏喊着；　　「賣冰呀！····賣冰。」潛水艇的製法  澹如　　小朋友１你們不是渴望着一種奇妙的玩具嗎？這裏讓我來告訴你吧要做一個潛水艇是很容易的事，你先拿一塊厚木板做成艇身，如第二圖，再照第三圖做成艇上的甲板，板上的甲是一個圖塔，可以用軟木塞代替，乙是艇上的探望鏡，用圓木條做成的，尖端緊插在軟木塞的裏面，做成以後，就拿圖塔膠在甲板上，甲板照第一圖膠在艇身的上面。　　現在要做開動的機器了，照第四做一條木片，一端穿孔，另一端就釘在潛水艇的尾端，如第一圖　　潛水艇的推動葉，如第五圖，可以用洋鐵剪成，如果你不會做，可以到洋鐵舖裏去買，幾個銅元就够了。再拿兩個小鐵鈎，一個緊釘在潛艇的前叚腹下，一個貫在艇尾的木條孔裏，要能隨意活動，再把推動葉緊接在這個鈎尾上，如第一圖，最後，拿一條橡皮帶，緊緊地繫在這兩鈎之間，潛水艇便成功了。　　以後頂好是漆上些顏色；艇色灰色，甲板綠色，圓塔黑色，探望鏡白色，推動葉紅色，這就很美觀了。　　　　玩法；仔細地將推動葉轉動，使橡皮帶紐緊，一手執着艇身，輕輕地放在池裏；將手一鬆，潛艇便一溜烟駛去了。三個時代的七奇　丨先講古代的丨  何公超　　　　（一）金字塔（二）大神像（三）縣空花園（四）大燈塔（五）大寺院（六）太陽神像（七）大墳墓　　幾干年以來，我們人類用了许許多血汗建築了許多偉大的工程，在古代有七奇，中世紀也有七奇，到了現代也有七奇，不過，現代的七奇，並不是什麽工程，而是····（是什麽呢？小朋友們，請大家猜猜看）。今天先講古代的七奇，，以後再講中世紀的與現代的。　　古代的七奇，第一是埃及的金字塔，佔地十三英畝，你想它是多末大！古代的七奇中，只有它還保存着，其餘都已經没有了。第二是夏令配亞地方的大神像，它有四址尺高，平台尙不算在内。第三是巴比侖的懸空花園，它造在三百英尺高的地基上，好像懸空一般，所以呌作懸空花園。第四是惡歷山大里亞一個島上的大燈塔，它的燈光週圍一百哩内都看得見，你想它多高多大？第五是以弗所（屬於小亞細亞）地方的帝那寺，它有三百四十二呎長，一百六十四呎闊。它是斷瓦殘垣尙有一些保存在倫敦的不列顚博物院裏。第六是羅德斯島（在地中海裏）上的太陽神像，像高一百○五呎，費了十二年的功夫才造成功。第七是墨索勒士的墓，墓在哈利嘉納蘇（屬於小亞細亞），它的一小部分斷垣殘壁亦保存在倫敦不列顚博物院裏。古代七奇梅雨與黴菌  冰玉　　（梅雨）一语，是從我國起頭的，就指梅子熟時所降雨的季節，在這季節。氣候潮濕，温度昇高，瀠瀠的細雨，不時的降下，這雨對於人體，雖然覺到精神鬱悶，起居不適，然而對於農產物的種植，是很重的，倘若没有這雨，農產物往往要歉收。梅雨的發一是什麽緣故呢？因爲每年到了這時季，長江一帶，受了太陽的直射，發生了低氣壓，這低氣壓向東進行，凑巧白林海峽的冰，到了三四月間，開始溶解，成爲寒流，這寒流在東海岸附近，約有三個月光景，流來流去。因爲寒流的高氣壓，很占優勢，與揚子江方面東進的低氣壓，常相衝突，遂變爲濛濛的細雨了。在宽時期，大槪消化不良，易患消化器病，鳥獸要脫毛羽，最討厭的，黴菌的繁殖最爲迅速。　　（黴菌）是不開花的植物，屬於菌類，爲極微細的絲體，在空氣中飛散，其胞子，附着於物體上，就會繁殖的。種類很多，依氣候與地位而不同，普通以毛黴，綠黴等爲最著，毛黴生於糕餅食物上，菌絲生於食物表面，有黑色的子囊，中有很多的胞子，綠黴生於衣服鞋帽或食物上，其胞子成熟，變爲綠色，飛散空中，黑黴與綠黴相像，亦生於食物上，初時爲無色的黴細菌絲，漸漸變爲黑色的胞子，這等黴菌，都是有害衛生的。在梅雨時爲，受了濕氣與水分的關係，其胞了隨處可以繁殖，如飛到齷齪的衣服上，就賴衣服上的污垢爲營養分，繁殖起來了。飛到食物上，那更有各種食物，爲其做營養分，當然易爲繁殖。若在乾燥淸潔的地方就失去其繁殖力，所以在梅雨時期内，因爲氣候漸濕，水分豐富，加以温度昇高，到處可以繁殖的。我們在這時季内，不論衣服飲食器具，應當特别注意哇。</p>

<p>婦女園地第二十一期悼居利夫人  茲九　　舉世聞名的居利夫人，於本月四日在法境伐倫斯地方、與世長逝了！　　消息傳來，毌任惋惜，際此世界婦女，大半仍是屬從愚昧的現世紀裏，夫人，不啻黑亂中的一顆巨星，這巨星，一旦殞落，以不使人黯然？　　夫人於一八六七年生於波蘭的華沙鄉間幼名ＳｋｌｏｂｏｏｕｓＫａｙａＭａｒｙ從小卽有志於科學，及長與居利結婚，兩人共同努力於化學的研究，以發肯新元質「銑」丨丨卽鑐錠Ｒａｄｉｕｍ爲醫治癌症之必需品，而得貝諾爾奬金，不幸居利遭枉死，夫人在哀痛之餘，仍繼續研究。雖生活困苦，仍不稍懈，至一九零七年，美國富翁贈夫人以一實騐室，從此才得有較完備的工具，此後，各方雖常有巨額的饋贈，夫人均以之購買銑質，從事實騐，以期精益求精，從不願以金錢作無謂之消費，歐戰時更努力於救護工作，活人萬千，她終身不辭勞瘁，不嫌困苦，孜孜焉爲人羣造福。所以，居利夫人，不但是一個偉大的科學家，一顆人類的救星，同時也是我們女界唯一的典型！　　同胞們，環顧我們週遭，懦怯，依賴，虚榮，愚昧····除此，現今的多數婦女，表現了些什麽呢？　　中國的居利夫人在那裏？中國到幾時才有如居利夫人那樣的人才出現？有人說現中國的社會，現中國的環境，不會產生中國的居利夫人的，但社會可由人力來改造，環境可由毅力來反配，在哀悼居利夫人之餘，我希望我同胞，大家都有居利夫人的精神。論姦殺  碧梧　　在東方，女人向來做的蒙頭母猪。據說回敎徒，如果在路上遇見自己的女人没有掛上面巾，就有殺掉她的權利。中國的情形，比這也並不高明；抛頭露面，女人是向所嚴禁。　　近來的光景眞呌好看；一方淫聲，淫色，淫舞，淫電影，淫淸唱，大大地流行；一方又捉姦，姦殺的把戲，閙得層出不窮。某處有肢解了的女屍，某處有野狗拖出來的小脚，都是這類丈夫殺了通姦的妻子的新聞。　　這些舊套重翻的把戲，當然不像放風箏，踢鍵子一樣，有人重新提倡。然而也没有聽見人嚴勵地加以剷滅。這在「古風之時兮」的季節，若任其自然的趨勢，無疑地會日以加烈。　　在禮敎防閑之下，女人竟肯冒死和别的男人通一點欵曲，她的結婚生活，無用說也知是不爲圓滿；而且那不圓滿的原因之中，常常是因丈夫有外遇。這樣的情形，誰該死呢？　　法國女作家喬治桑，在她的作品中曾這樣的寫過「虚僞最是污損婦女的東西。所謂姦通。不是她委身於愛人之時，而是她其後和她的丈夫共夜的時候。」然而一般丈夫們，不但以爲委身給了愛人的妻子，自己還有權强迫她共夜，而且還以爲自己有權殺戳她的和愛人共夜，他們和專制時代的君王一樣，因爲擁有特權，便一切視爲當然，臉厚到無可形容。　　蒙古的瀚海，互古是沙漠至今還有沙漠；西藏的喜馬拉耶山互古是雪山至今還是雪山。一切的現象若任其自然，自然可以很久不變。我們如果要像一個有文化的國家。這種封建的，野蠻的姦殺的行爲，宜如何從政治的，社會的，加以種種的制裁和開導呢？因梅蘭芳想到鄧肯  易勾無　　最近梅蘭芳赴蘇聯的問題好像是在惹起了許多人的討論，可是，就在這個時候，我却想起了那位名震歐洲的鄧肯（ＩｓａｄｏｒａＤｕｃａｎ）。　　這連想不是没有理由的。第一，鄧肯在歐洲的聲名實在有些像梅蘭芳之在中國，同時也是曾經到過俄國的，第二，我和這位天才的舞女曾經有過一面的緣分；時間是在十多年以前，好時節也正是像現在這樣的一個酷熱的天氣。　　說鄧肯在歐洲像梅蘭芳在中國，這實在太唐突了鄧肯，不過這兒所指的只是在社會上的魔力而已。至於鄧肯所代表的藝術和她已有的貢獻，那自然和我們的梅郎没有一點相同的地方。　　我和鄧肯的會見是在巴黎響鄉間一位瑞士人家中的消暑會裏面。那天蒞臨的人客很多，鄧肯好像是一位不速之客。她的裝束是非常簡單。在許多人的包圍中，她縱聲談笑，無疑地，一望而知她是一個非凡的藝術家。我和她僅僅握了兩次手，交談的話也只有兩句，或者只有一句半也說不定，但是，她授給人的那種磊落而有獨立氣槪的印象使我怎樣也磨滅不掉。　　這位有奇才的女子所以能震動人心的固然一方面是由於她的藝術，一方面却也是由於她勇邁的革命精神。她的敢作敢爲，對於眞理的擁護，漫說是現代的女子，就是在男子中也是不可多得。在她一生中不可勝舉的事蹟中間，幾乎十有九都是有革命精神的。最爲人傳頌的和她在柏林街上被大學生包圍，要求她演說，她竟指着街上帝王的雕像破口大駡，說那不是美術，應該毁掉。再如意大利軍國主義詩人達能秋（ＤＡｎｎｕｎｚｉｅ）要和她結交，她竟當他夜半來時，把房中佈置成喪事的塲面，使詩人睡在牀上，像供奉死人一樣的給他四圍點起白燭，她則步着蕭賓的「出喪曲」一面跳舞，一面把燭光吹熄，結果是達能秋恐怖和呌了一聲，踉蹌地逃走了。這前一件事可以看出她是怎樣的一個厭惡專制與戰爭的人物，後一件事則更是妙到不可言狀，她是給軍國主義的詩人做了一塲送死的「道塲」。　　不消說像這種行徑，不要說我們變男爲女的梅郎是連夢也不會夢到，就是歐洲其他同樣的藝術家也從來没有過這樣的魄力。　　鄧肯解放了婦女有服裝，開創了現代的舞術，犧牲了所有的一切去辦學校，結果是窮愁萬狀，她抱着很大的計劃，想成立一個她理想中的跳舞團，然而事與願違。她在要赴俄的時候，簡直高興得發狂。連衣裳也不願帶走，以爲從此可以和「舊世界」絶緣，那料後來仍不能如她所想像，反而還發生了和詩人葉賽寗的悲慘故事。晚年寂寞的她，在法國南方妮市因汽車壓住了圍巾，竟被絞死，她終於齎志以没。　　白爾納兒（Ｂｅｒｎｈａｒｄｔ），我是没有見過；杜翠（Ｄｕａｅ），我僅見過她一次表演，但却没有「親炙」過。不過，這些對於我都没有甚麽遺憾，最遺憾的却是我只和鄧肯見了那麽一面，而竟然不曾看見過她一次表演。　　她的ＭｙＬｉｆｅ（中國有譯本，但聽說不是全譯）一書可以說是一部最有趣味的文學作品。我們讀她這本書，眞是「如見其人」。像書中叙述她和那位漂这而有錢的丈夫的結合是爲了她的失戀，但那位丈夫對她却第一次便給了一個庸俗的感受。她在問他平日做的甚麽，而他的回答却是；「我藏了不少十八世紀的鼻烟壺。」又像叙述和她另一位財主的丈夫同居，使她感到極端的痛苦。她不斷地向他講她生活的意義，反惹起他的恐怖。她給他誦惠德莽的名詩，他却嫌惡地呌了起來。　　總之她的自傳，簡直是一串動人的故事，我希望能看英文的人都去讀牠。　　本來不應該把梅蘭芳儘管和鄧肯拉在一起的，但因爲有梅蘭芳的赴俄纔連想到鄧肯，所以不由不再發一點對比的疑問；鄧肯到俄國以後，的確是有過很大的貢獻；但是我們變男爲女的梅郎到俄國去能做甚麽，這倒是我們應當想到的事體。論婦女（續）  高爾基著樊英譯　　二　　男性爲打獵者。他尙未脫離動物的狀態，在此種狀態中，動物本能，體力，弱肉强食，還佔着優勢，所以他需要極厲害極殘酷的方法，爲的防止獵者集團中粗暴的動物的雄性鬥爭的復活，這鬥爭有使人類集團瓦解或毁滅之虞。由是靑年歷受種種辛苦和戒律，有些部落且採取特别的方法，以保護老者的生命和經騐。恐女性破壞男性中間的社會關係，限制與女性往來，命令消費一定食物，此種對女性的態度，從此也開始了。　　男性打獵的勞動，本質上，還帶着動物性；尋求，追跡，包圍掠奪物，先用一番大力量，然後來一個長時期的休息，無憂無慮的安閑，但是女性勞動，却得人類發展，卽有經常的，系統的，紀律化的意識和有訓練的理智的處理生活。　　原因是懷朶與分娩，把女性拘束起來，迫使她們看護自己和小孩，防禦野獸，大雨、暴風。嚴寒。女性隱藏於穴洞，以樹枝編作茅屋。久而久之，便發現了可食的樹根，草類，種子，果實，利用鳥卵作食料。發見酸草有停止流血的特性，於是找到了藥草。火。大槪也是女性發見的，起初拾集森林焚燒後的灰燼，久之遂熟悉了火，後便設法經常地保持之，以至於看見兩木摩擦生熱和兩石相碰時的火星，得知了取火。人種誌上並未把發現火的功績歸於女性，但我們由邏輯的推想，取火正是婦女發現，而且學會的。其交要知道，人種誌不能列在特别「精確」的科學以内。正是女性利用火。來作食物及其他需用，火是那時原始人所征服的唯一的目然力量。女　將幼小禽獸的足翼折斷，把牠們馴舉起來。女味覺性的發展，較快於男性味覺發展；女性用種子，草類，果實充食，並且她們比男性先知道了甜，酸，苦，辣，及植物對於消化的影響。　　由上述種種，可以推知。走向安定生活的道路。是由女性指示給男子的。在人類社會轉向安定的生活上，尤其在與家庭經濟同時發展的原始的所謂「採掘」農業（此種農業全在女性手中）女性各種有益的活動，實有很重要的意義。於是形成了一種母系血族制。這時女性居於統治地位，指揮男性作戰。在凡與智慧，知識；及與自然規律；和征服自然觀念有關的一切；都歸功於女性的。在人類社會發展的這一時期，女性的尊重和女性在社會事業上的威權，是很大的，迄今不但在文化落後的民族中，且在歐洲的習慣上，仍保留着「母地」的模型。女巫，聖女，女仙等等觀念都是從此而來的，此等觀念以後被事件的行程所殘害。而變爲「老巫婆」，「女妖魔」等等了。　　不但女性的智識使原始人類驚奇，且女性生理上的特點，亦爲所驚嚇，例如，婦女的生產，婦女一胎產生二子或三子。甚至生產奇胎；有尾巴的，狗頭的，出毛的，或胸部多乳房的女孩。這些奇胎是暗示着婦女與野獸同居，同時，在有些古傳裏說。婦女與山羊，家畜同居，是她的特性，敎會責駡婦女與惡魔同居，且把幾千婦女架在柴上，活活地燒死。這種古傳還遺留到今日。十九世紀九十年代時日。十九世紀九十年代時，在雅庫特（在西伯里亞）地方有一警官，報告省長說；通古斯民族的婦女與熊同居已生了小孩。　　在安靜的社會中，女性比男性先有迅速發展智能的環境。自然，這環境是由她的勞動所造成的。　　「史前考古學」的證明，在古石器時代；當人類還不能製造器具而仍以亂石作工具時，他們已把碎石或骨作爲各種裝飾品，在新石器時代（約後于古石器時代數千年），則用磨擦光滑的石製成工具，且加添花紋，裝飾品的數量也大爲增加，如珠子，紐扣，用介殼做成的頸飾品等等。在這兩時代，對於宗敎文化的暗示，在考古學上没有任何材料。因此可以斷定說，藝術工程卽審美情感是先於「宗敎情感」，且這個情感是由勞動所產生的。法令摘要　　第二章婚烟　第一節婚約　　第九百七十二條婚約，應用男女當事人自行訂定。　　第九百七十三條男未滿十七歲，女未滿十五歲者，不得訂定婚約。　　第九百七十四條未成年人訂定婚約，應得法定代理人之同意。　　第九百七十五條婚約不得請求强迫履行。　　第九百七十六條婚約當事人之一方，有左列情形之一者，他方得解除婚約；　　一婚約訂定後，再與他人訂定婚約或結婚者。　　二故遠結婚期約者。　　三生死不明已滿一年者。　　四有重大不治之病者。　　五有花柳病或其他惡疾者。　　六婚約訂定後，或爲殘廢者。　　七婚約訂定後與人通姦者。　　八婚約訂定後、受徒形之宣告者。　　九有其他重大事出者。　　依前項規定解除婚約者，如事實上不能向地方解除之意思表示時，無須爲滿意表示，自得爲解除時起，不受婚约之拘束。　　第九百七十七條依前條之規定婚約解除時，無過無失之一方，得向有過失之他方請求賠償其因此所受之損害。　　第九百七十八條婚約當事人之一方，無第九百七十六條之理由而違反婚約者，對於他方因此受之損害，應負賠償之責。　　第九百七十九條前條情形，雖非財產上之損害，受害人亦得請求賠償相當之金額，但以受害人無過失者爲限。　　前項請求權不得讓與或繼承，但已依契約承諾，或已起訴者。不在此限。婦女應有的性交常識  良　　目前中國一般的靑年，男的很多犯着神經衰弱症，花柳病，肺癆病；女的有不少患着子宮病，月經病，白帶病等。這種靑年病之發現，固另有其社會的經濟的原因；可是缺乏性的智識之指導，也是重要原因之一。向來爲父母者在子女的面前，總是諱說「性」的問題；卽學校裏的敎師，對於學生也忌談「性育」。而性這一方面的知識，就成爲神秘穢褻，不可究詰的東西。故一有人談及「性」字，總免不了有些人丨尤其是所謂「道德」家，要表示頭痛。　　然而站在科學的敎育的立塲上說，關於性這一方面的事情，乃是男女老幼必須肯有的常識；而爲了性器官的構造和其功用之比較的複雜之故，女子對於性的常識之研求，尤爲不可或緩。今僅就性交一事來論，卽有下面幾點爲每個靑年女子所必須明曉的；　　（一）首次性交的注意處女與男子首次性次，不僅處女膜要被破裂，而且膣部同時也也損傷（多在膣之右側的後壁），甚至外陰，會陰，膀胱等處，都會伴有輕度的裂痕，這固然是初次性交必有的現象；但主要的原因，往往還是由於性交暴力作用的結果。爲了避免發生這一種過甚性的裂傷起見，女子在初期與男子發生肉體的交接時，應該打破恥澀的觀念，放出自動的精神，以防止對方任情使用過度的氣力。有時因兩性生殖器官的不匀稱，丨丨男生殖器的過大，或女膣的過窄（發育不完全），丨丨女的方面尤應注意限制對方之暴；力的動作，以减少裂傷的痛苦。因爲裂傷過甚，是極容易從而發生炎症。甚至性感退。（未完）與平一婦團體談話  聶曾紀芬　　（上略）鄙人來平不久對於社會情形，尚不十分明了；不過就大體説來；此地是千年來舊都，久爲文化重心，無論就家庭社會，都可看出；禮讓，各和順儉樸三種美德，爲他處所不及，這三種美德，是應該極力保存，而加以發揮的；不過在時代潮流激盪之下，恐怕也很不容易維持，現在的時髦人。拿了自由一個名詞，想抺殺一切，實在是錯了。一個人誠然要自由，但是必須尊重他人的自由，然後所得的自由方是眞的，鄙人眼中所見，耳中所聞，常有少年子女，全不體諒父母負擔之重，專謀自己的娛樂。稍不如意，就認爲没有自由，殊不想父母負擔的力量有限，而自己的慾望無窮，到了那時，一家的經濟能力。必定同歸於敗。自由是與獨立連帶的，現在的靑年男女，快樂是要自由的，經濟却是要倚賴的，眞可謂民族性墮落的表現。所以諸位如能就上面所說的；禮讓，和順，儉樸三種美德。加以保存發揮。不獨是北平的福音，也是全民族的一個轉機。關於「婦人心」  先　　自從我在本刋第十期上發表了「婦人心」以後。陸續地接到幾封批評的信；有的也在本刋上發表過了。　　批評的大半是「不對」；我很感謝這些批評的誠摯，正直！我更感謝蘭如女士的那些懇切而直率的話！　　「狠毒婦人心」，這句駡人的話，當觭是男子創造的。當男人一受到了些婦人的小小報復時，他們就下這樣惡毒的罪狀。向來是以柔和，温靜，慈惠等爲高尙的婦德的社會，一個婦人能不視此「咒語」爲恐怖的嗎？最富瘁犧牲，容忍而愛好榮譽的婦人，誰又願負一個「狠毒」之名而不容忍，犧牲的？　　婦人一致向崇高的美德丨丨慈愛，淑靜，柔和等丨丨努力，建築下堅固的「懦弱」的根基，形成了女性牢獄打不破的牆壁。「狠毒婦人心」，婦人的心想要狠，要毒，也就無能爲力了！　　爲什麽婦人的（心）不能「狠」一點「毒」一點呢？社會給婦人的待遇是不是太殘酷了？婦人的「心」已經被時代的潮聲喚醒，她知道了自己的痛苦，她會要「狠」起來「毒」起來的吧？　　過去的我，是一個弱者，因爲我太重感情了。我的家庭是個比較解放的。我在一個能够自由發展的環境中，却給自己造下了苦痛的，不自由的現實；這是我怎樣痛傷的一件事！我是如何地幼稚，單純；一棵粿富於情，熱血的心不好好地用在爲大衆，爲人類的事業上，會讓她掉在污潭裏，苦海中！現在我明白了；什麽是感情，什麽是人生；我只恨我的心不「狠」不「毒」！　　我寫「婦人心」就是想表白一個婦人的心懦弱丨丨感情熱烈，意志薄弱。多少個懦弱的婦人心存在，產生在新女性的羣中，我希望她們都覺悟到婦人心的懦弱的「不對」；我希望她們用「狠毒」的心去對付那殘酷的待遇！　　最後，我要告訴蘭如女士的；我現在把小孩子的責任都自己担負着，我絶不是想把孩子當寳貝要佔有牠，也不是對孩子們還有感情作用捨不得抛開他們，我也認淸了孩子是社會的了，可是我不能趕快抛棄孩子。因爲我不知道」我們的社會」在那裏？所謂「孤兒院」「育婴堂」，難道可以讓幾個天眞聰明的孩子葬送在裏面嗎？（我想，如果我的心狠毒一點，我與其眼看着孩子們在世上受活罪，不如親手弄死他們。）我想；我自己也是社會的，并非我自己的。我帶着孩子是替社會盡義務，我能够替社會做事的力量只有這樣大，這樣寛。等到我找到我可信托的。只要是爲我們大衆而設的孤兒院和育嬰堂或托兒所時，我就把孩子送去。總之，我掙扎着活一天，替社會人類盡一天職，也就是替孩子服一天務。我不貪自己的享樂；我願意做奴隸，做牛馬，犧牲個人，爲了幾個社會上的將來的戰士們。　　自然，我是否有這些力量實現我的理想；或因我的不自量反而害了幾個有用的孩子？但是我似乎不應再如此猶疑；我應該抱樂觀，信任自己的理想，盡力地做去。不計成敗利害。　　我是個愚戇的人。不能說很漂亮的話。做個漂亮的人。我并不贊美那些做賢妻良母的；但也反對那些拿「打倒賢妻良母」做口香糖的，自己却盡量享受那些低級的物質享樂，和虚榮的自慰只是澈底的自私自利的，社會的廢物。我想跟隨着那些忍辱負重，含苦茹辛的戰士們，默然前進。</p>

<p>申報業餘周刊業餘漫談最近公布的關稅新稅則  公樸　　最近盛傳一時的修正關稅新稅則，已於七月三日公布了。在這個稅則裏，其於本國工業競爭最烈，影響最鉅的幾項入口物品，如人造，紙貨，棉貨之類，稅率都酌量减輕，尤其是棉貨稅率竟减至百分之十至百分之五十不等，我國的工業是建築在輕工業上，而這幾項工業，不是佔着主要的地位，就是還可勉强維持。在這各國對我狂風暴雨的傾銷政策之下，更加着國民經濟的貧困，我國民族工業早已無日不在風雨飄搖之中，若現在的新稅則再給各國傾銷政策以一極在便宜，那就危險了。所以，自從新稅則頒行之後，已引起了工商業方面極大的反感，近日的報紙上已屢見它們希望政府糾正這稅則的函電、但是它們反對的理由祗是從與自己有切身利害的營業觀點出發，其實在這世界各國大家競謀鞏固關稅壁壘之秋，我國减輕輸入稅率，我們不可不加以研究的。　　關稅政策原分兩種，一種是保護政策，另一則爲自由政策，實現自由政策的國家，一定是自己國家内產業非常發達，無慮國外貨物之侵入，反因要使製造工業發達之故，必需輸入廉價原料，所以這些國家的徵收關稅，祇是爲了「調劑」國家的財政，並無保護本國工業的目的。反之，在工商業不發達的國家，却必須築固它們的關稅壁壘，使輸入品不能與本國物品競爭。一向實行自由政策著名的國家是英國、但近年來也早已放棄這種政策而採取保護制度。其原因就是，現在各國工業發展已到了極度，英國早已失去了先進的資格，她再也不敢擺出那不怕人家競爭的架子了。所以，一個國家欲實行某種關稅政策，主要的是要顧慮到整個國民經濟的發展，謀公共財政上的收入，祇能算作是次要目的。從我國的情形來說。則關稅政策不特應有保護幼稚工業之目的，且有防範整個國民經濟爲帝國主義經濟侵略而崩潰之絶大作用。外貨獨占了我國市塲，民族工業是崩潰了，因之而起的必然是失業人數的增加，農村經濟的更形衰落，現存上海的棉紗廠，早已在逐漸减工，裁工之中，若再受新稅則的打擊，大多數廠家一定不克勉强維持，這樣，又不知要增加若干新的失業隊伍了。　　有些人以爲祇要關稅能够自主，帝國主義的束縛就可解除了。但由於這次的事實，我們可以知道這種見解實是倒果爲因，完全是幻想。前天本報所載的市商會呈院部文中有云；「··今乃有人乘軍事佔領之餘威，强欲我以怨爲德，如果枉己徇人，遇事聽命，何以爲國，此尤不可之尤者。」弦外之音。我們不難窺見這次政府爲什麽要减稅的原因了。　　這種舉動，在現政府下實現，這不能不說是一件憾事。並且，這種事情的發生，除了上述的兩個嚴重的影響外，更有一點爲吾人所應深切注意的就是民衆與工商界對於政治的漠視態度。我們民衆對於政治的不關心，早爲一般人所深悉，此次對於新稅則的漠視自爲必然的結果，本無足怪。據我們知道。關於新稅則的内容，工商界的領袖在事前已有所聞，但祇有少數人與政府有所接洽，並未具體的有組織的向政府作任何磋商，遂因少數人之力量輕微，而無補於事。像這種與工商業有切膚之痛的新稅則問題，却也如此的漠不關心，則尤足令人駭怪！現在新稅則已正式公佈實行了。這幾天雖然有人反對和請願，但是事後的反對，恐怕很不易收效罷？</p>

<p>生活畫師  士美　　安排給畫家們走的路子是很廣大的，從工塲，學校，公司，商店，報館，書店，影片公司，一直到黨政軍各機關··都需要這方面的人才，雖然他們的出路多，但因爲美術靑年大批的被半野雞式的美術專科學校製造出來後，生存競爭亦跟着劇烈起來，他們的職業要求便必然地難於美滿、尤其是在這經濟恐慌深刻化的現階段，他們的出路將是一天窄狹一天，必然在位置的獲得上，要感到粥少僧多的痛苦了。　　他們最好的出路要算是去作官了。在黨政軍機關裏當一名藝術指導員或藝術宣傳員，我則一月拿一二百元，少也可拿三五十元，工作旣較淸間，又過着一班流浪的畫家們所望塵莫及的豐裕生活，是相當理想的了。不過這裏也有一點難處，就是；作爲一個藝術家，大槪是没有不愛自由和放任的，没有不厭惡那些呆板和束縛人的人爲鎖鍊與規則的，不幸在機關中的規律生活方式偏不合他們的口胃；他們爲了生存，大致是不能不壓抑自已的放任傾向的。　　當一名學校中的圖畫敎師，是多數美術學生們所最期望的吧？在内地，以每一小時一元，一元二角五，一元五角，一元七角五的代價出賣自己繪畫知識的高初中圖畫敎師，每月少也有五六址元，多則有百餘元的收入，是不辜負他們在學生時代的努力的了。即使當不了高初中的圖畫敎師，在小學裏敎敎圖畫，也未嘗不算是一個可以倚仗着生活的職位，薪給雖微薄到每月只有一二十元或二三十元，但比之那班流浪的藝術家們的生活全無着落，總要好得多吧？　　工塲，公司，商店，也爲美術靑年們開闢了一條生路，爲了要「生意興隆」，擴大營業，一個美術師是必然需要，必然要被僱用的。以一個美術宣傳員，廣告師，櫉窗師而出現，他們在爲着大小資本家的利潤而努力着。他們替老板們設計着大幅的廣告，精巧的櫉窗，以誘惑主顧的光臨選購；又以他們的聰明創制了各種别出心裁的美術字，言過其實的推薦了貨品的精美，使得街頭」過客」們從身邊摸出荷也送到老板的櫃台上去。爲了他們的忠實與辛勞，老板們每月酬勞他們少則三四十元，多亦不過六七十元的薪水。我知道有一個美術靑年以每月三十元被僱用於一個運動器具公司，又有一個以每月四十元被僱用於一家紙烟工廠，又有一個以每月五十元被僱用於一個大百貨商店，他們還都須膳宿自備，工作時間則每日最少四五小時，多可至八九小時。　　書店和報館也有僱用圖書編輯的。這在畫家們自然也是一個　當的「優差」，雖其薪水少則僅四十元上下，多亦不能過百元，而工作時間又相當的長，工作又相當的辛苦，自然，他　可以在職業以外抓再點「外快」，比如替人家畫幾張書報封面，照誾價每張可有五元意外的進益；或畫幾張信箋簿的外封面（如「卿卿箋」「伴侣箋」，「兒童箋」，「戀愛箋」，「慈母箋」，「明星箋」，「···」等等），照市價每張也可意外的拿到三元。無論從那方面看，得到這種職位的人兒應該說是相當幸運的人兒。　　電影公司的佈景師，美術員，雖是更爲專門的一種職業，但這種人才大半也都是美術學生出身，有的固受過相當的專門訓練，有的則僅以一個普通美術家的資格參加進這種產業部門。因爲這種人才比較的缺乏，待遇方面自然比較的優厚，普通每月的收入總不會少過七八十元的。資格老，技能熟的，每月一百幾十元也是有的。他們的主要工作是佈景的設計，至於實地搭蓋佈景，則另有佈景工人；他們只是以一個設計者，指導者，監察者而存在的。他們的工作應該說並不怎樣辛苦；然则電影界常在深夜攝製，有時則須跋涉山川，跑到千百里以外的地方去拍外景，這其中的辛苦勞瘁，該是不難想到的吧？　　上面所說的是畫家們經常的職業生活。那些没有固定職業的，也是要以他們的衣鉢去換取麵包的。他們可去的地方也是相當的廣大；他們常是以論件計値的方法。從公司，商店，書店，報館，雜誌社，··取得他們的生活之資。由朋友的介紹，他們可以替一家公司設計一扇櫉窗，這常是立體派或構成派的裸女的鋸刻和油繪，把這送到老板那裏作爲報酬，他們從老板那裏取回他們血汗的代價。這報酬常是不很小的，我有一位朋友就擺過這麽一扇窗飾，老板報酬了二十元，而他所花的本錢不過二元，除了所花的幾日工夫不算外，他却是一本九利的取償了呢。　　替書店畫封面，畫書中插畫，畫信簽簿，這也是那些窮、藝術家們所求之不得的好交易。他們的工作效率很大，比如一天他們可將十種信箋簿的封面構圖好，着色再用一天工夫，每種三元，兩天不就可賺三十元了嗎？可惜的，這種工作是並不常有的？　　投稿到報屁股，到小型的期刋，到大小畫報，他們的畫稿雖常不免被編輯先生投入字紙簍，然而在這方面成功的實也不乏人。我認識一位這樣的投稿家，因爲已有點小名氣，報紙副刋，期刋，畫報上都選登他的大作，東凑西凑的每月竟使他有百元以上的收入！這眞是難能可貴，但有這樣好運氣的美術靑年到底很少呵！　　雖然上面說過美術家的出路相當廣大，但我却仍要說靠油彩顏料墨汁吃飯的到底是一件艱苦而困難的事。這碗飯難得吃，有别種天才的就不得不去改行，另圖他就。他們有的去作作家，有的去當音樂師，有的去當播音員，或話劇與電影演員、有的則去流浪，過他們所謂波希米亞式的藝術家的漂泊生活，有的則和許多没有出路的大學生一樣，回到故鄉去吃吃家中祖遺的「老米飯」，或在市鎭鄉間去當當「土紳士」，以度過他們無聊的時日。應徵  麗女士　　就像一朶給風吹着的天際的浮雲，我又從長江的上游飄到下游來。船開進吳淞口，燈光煇煌裏，上海已經龐大地攝進我的眼簾了。明朗的秋夜的天空在頭上笑着，我的心在懷底笑着，那飛揚在玫瑰色的大都市的夜色裏的，不應當　　我是載着一顆尋找職業的希望的心來到上海的。　　馬路在白天在夜晚不停地沸騰着，我也捲進那沸騰的浪潮裏尋覓那含着笑的希望，但那希望只是停留在夢一般隱約的夜色裏的，當你踐踏着現實的道路追求牠的時候，牠是狡滑地飛走了，消逝了。　　於是我失着業，十天，二十天，三十天····那顆含笑的希望的心，在我的懷底枯萎了。　　我悲哀地咬着果腹的大餅，憤怒地推着身邊的牆壁職業依然和我隔離得遠遠地，連這雙獵狗似的在報紙的徵求欄逡巡着的眼睛，也漸次遲鈍下來。　　但有一天（大槪那天有着光朗的睛空吧），我的手顫抖地拆閱一封珍貴的來信了。那是兩天前寫出去應徵ＸＸ公司經理部招請打字員的回音，我提出五十元一月的薪金被接受，並且只約我第二天去面談一次，我的天呀，這該不是夢吧？職業是找到了，生活是有了解决了，你倒霉的冷大餅給我滾蛋吧，倒霉的小而又黑的亭子間也給我滾蛋，吧！我將要坐在光亮的充滿了太陽的房間裏，啜着香甜的麫包和咖啡做早餐，我將要伏在優美的燈光底下翻讀我所愛好的書本，也許我還要用五塊錢裝置一個無綫電的聽筒，偷聽那在天空裏飄行着的音樂，讓我疲乏的肢體在優美的音樂的愛撫底下沉沉地睡去·····假如，明天的「面談」出了什麽岔兒呢？呀！我不敢想下去了。　　第二天的難關逃過了。第三天的早上我踏進了那華貴的經理室。我是在現實裏抓住了我的夢想，我要在這裏謹防着這夢想再給風吹了開去。　　經理的頭光秃秃的，肥胖的雪茄吐出些淡藍的圈子，他就在那圈子中間呆呆地獃着。我的來到，好像引起了他很大的注意，陡從他那純綱的圈椅裏跳起來，嘻開着嘴，殷勤地招呼我坐下，温功課似的將昨天副經理問我的話重覆一遍，然後搓搓手，笑了一笑，看住我低聲地說道；　　「那末，照這樣看來，小姐還没有結婚？丨」　　我怔了一下，隨卽若無其事地點點頭。</p>

<p>「很好，很好，我最佩服自由的人。哈，哈，哈····」那笑聲裏面包含些什麽呢，我不知道，但我聽得出牠没有好意，而且潛伏着危機。爲了使自已從那危機裏拔出來，我向他說；　　「先生！請把我應做的工作分派給我吧！」　　「哦，哦！不忙，不忙！今天剛來，我們隨便談談吧！」　　我不耐地換了一張離開他更遠的椅子坐下，隨手拿起一張報紙來翻着，那經理似拉覺得這僵局不能再繼續維持了，於是東翻西找地翻出了兩張文稿交給我，要我從打字機上打出來。文稿都是那樣短，花不了兩個鐘頭就可以弄完的，餘下的時候又陪經理談天嗎？我想着，對於那夢想的希望的實現懷疑起來。「五十塊錢一月便幹些這樣的勾當嗎？」我仍在不敢想像下去·········　　「很好，很好，坐下來談談吧！」當我將打好的文稿交給經理的時候，他又嘻開着嘴，沉濁地笑着。我退在旁邊坐下，眼睛釘在自己的脚上。　　「Ｘ小姐，你一個人在上海，想來是很孤寂的吧！哈，哈，哈，···」又是那討厭的笑。但我還鎭靜着。那嗄聲的沉濁的聲音繼續下去；　　「我呢，也是一個人住着丨」　　「哦，先生的賓眷不在上海嗎？」我輕輕地嘘了一口氣。　　「没有家眷。我去年剛從美國回來，還没有家眷！」他好像要證明什麽，語氣是那麽重，但隨卽又放輕了；　　「Ｘ小姐，你是聰明人，你一定知道我請你到這裏來的用意····」　　一個驚嘆號猛然地在我神經上撞了一下，我陡的站起來，準備起。但一隻粗而且熱的膀臂握住了我的手，混濁的氣息從我的頭頂拂下來。我使盡氣力一掙，「碰」的一聲響，不知道是門關着響呢，還是那經理拿出手槍來打我，但我安心了，我已經衝出了那華貴同時也是卑污的他的辦公室·····　　明朗的秋夜的天空仍然在我頭上笑着，但我向高貴的洋房裏尋找職業的迷夢是淸醒了！我的脚必須向另一條路走去，我仍然要在這複雜的社會上尋找我的職業，因爲我要活！國際廣播無線電台美國復興運動與救濟失業的成效  夢白　　羅斯福的復興運動，無疑的，唯一的目的在救濟失業的工人，而結果，復興運動，對於失業工人的救濟，早已有了相當的成效。單就建築業的工人而言，向工會登記的失業者，現在得獲工作的已有一百萬人，可知在建築業方面。已有活動的氣象了。　　建築界方面，所有的工人，大部分是失業了，而且已失業了好久，雖然没有正確的統計，但至少當有二百萬人。名人曾國藩語錄  周樂山　　姑不論他的反民族的行爲是如何的不對；曾國藩一生的刻苦治學和光明謹愼的爲人，不愧爲諸葛亮而後的第一人。暑夜偷閑，讀完了一部他手寫的日記，現將他關於做人與治學的警語摘錄於後，以供讀者之採擇。　　（一）文章之事，以讀書多，積理富爲要。　　（二）讀書之志，須以困勉之功，志大人之學。　　（三）岱雲言余，「第一要戒怠慢之氣，」眞切中膏肓也，又言予「於朋友每相持過深，不知量而後入，隨處不留分寸，卒至小者齟龉，大者凶隙，不可不愼。」又言我「處事不患不精明，患太刻薄，」須步步留心。　　（四）竹如言「敬」字最好，予謂須添一「和」字，則所好者，方不是勉强反持，卽禮樂不可斯須去身之意。　　（五）心得語，一經說破，胸中便無餘味，所謂德之棄也；况無不得而有掠影之談乎？　　（六）凡事之須逐日檢點者，一日姑待，後來補救則難矣；况進德修業之事乎？　　（七）人處德我者不足歡，心術處相怨者而能平情，必君子也。　　（八）我誠能言必忠信，不欺，不妄語，積久人自知之，不讚人亦不怪，苟有試而譽人，人且引以爲重，若日日譽人，人必不重我言矣，欺人自欺，滅忠信，喪廉恥，皆在於此。　　（九）竹如說理，言捨「敬」字，别無下手之方，總以「嚴」「肅」爲要。　　（十）大人敎以保身三要；曰節欲，節勞，節飲食，又言；凡人交友，恒見得友不是而我是，所以今日管鮑，明日秦越。　　（十一）萬化始於閨門，除「刑于」以外無政化，除「用費」以外無經濟。　　（十二）心常忡忡不自恃，若有所失亡者，蓋志不能立，時易放倒，故心無定向，無定向，則不能靜，不能靜，則不以安其根，只在志之不定耳。　　（十三）將盡之膏，豈可速之以風，萌蘖之木，豈可牧之以牛羊，苟失其養，無物不消，况氣血素虧者乎？　　（十四）凡辦公事，須視公事如已事，爲國爲民，亦宜處處視如一身一家之圖，方能親切。　　（十五）杜詩韓文，所以百世不朽者，彼自有知言養氣功夫，惟其知言，故有一二見道語，談及時事，亦甚識當在要務；惟其養氣。故無纖薄之響。　　（十六）平日辯論夸誔之人，不能遽變聾啞，惟當談論漸低，開口必誠，力去狂妄之習。　　（十七）人必中虚不著一物，而後能眞實無妄，蓋實者，不欺之謂也。人之所以欺人者，必心中别着一物，心中有私見，不敢告人，而後造僞言以欺人，若心中了不着私物，而又何心欺人哉？其所以自欺者，亦心中别着私心也。所知在好德，而所知在好色，不能去好色之私，則不能不欺其好德之私矣。是故誠者，不欺者也。不欺者，心無私着也。無私着者，至虚者也。是故天下之至誠，天下之至虚者也。當讀書則讀書，心無着於見客也。當見客則見客，心無着於讀書也。當時不雜，旣過不戀，是謂之虚而已矣，是謂之誠而已矣。　　（十八）爲人惡言不出於口，岔言不反於身，此不之知，遑問其他。</p>

<p>這些失業的工人，又大半是具有高深的技術，生活程度也很高；也是消費量很大的階級，他們失了業，不但自己難以生活，而且還影響及他們所消費的各種物品的銷路。　　美國，失業的工人，最多的時候，到達一三·○○○·○○○人，但現在私人經營的實業，失業者已覓得工作的，有二·七五○·○○○人，爲公衆服務的三五○·○○○人，另外在各地方機關工作的也有三五○·○○○人。至於農業和實業界方面現在仍繼續不斷的在添僱工人。　　據當局所說，今年八九兩月公家方面更須添僱不少的工人。直接僱用的也許將到達百萬的數目。在美國，失業問題到現在還是閙得很厲害，唯一的原因就在投資的人現在不多；假如私人或國家準備投資一·○○○·○○○·○○元、開發新事業，那麽至少又可使一百萬失業的工人得獲職業呢！土耳其五年實業計劃  夢白　　土耳其第一度五年實業計劃現在已開始進行了，在當局方面，準備在這五年計劃中，固定的資金。一共美金三五，○○○，○○○元。爲了標語中有「實行圍裙獨立二語，他們已决定先行開辦規模宏大的國營紗廠四家。在土耳其本國棉花的出品雖是不少，但棉布的進口，專用以製造一般在經濟制度下工作的奴隷的圍裙的，過去十年之中，總共有美金四五○，○○○，○○○元。　　在經濟方面，默斯太發凱末爾政府比其他種種更見注意。把土耳其由一個原始的農業國改成一個能够工業自給的工業國，的確不是一件容易的事，而且，在短時期内自屬難能實現的。土政府方面，事前曾經向東部金礦區域。以至南部的棉區，所有從事礦業，實業，以至農業的美國的，土國的專家，徵集報告，從事研究，然後决定這五年實業計劃。　　官塲方面。實行五年計劃而後，五年之中所投的資金三五，○○○，○○○元，經過一度研究而後，可保證在五年之内，進口的熟貨，减少百分之三十，眼前要準備先事進行的實業，以原料在土國有出產的爲限，像棉，絲，鐵，煤，假象牙，木汁，山羊毛，硫磺等都有出產，將先行製造熟貨。　　各種重要的實業都由國家經營，私人經營的祗限小規模的實業，像花邊，天鵝絨，磁器，硫磺，和其他種種的小企業，向俄國訂的五百萬建設借欵，合美金八，○○○，○○○元，係專作購買紗廠的機器之用，他們擬在開賽里，拿西里，苛尼亞，和亞達那等地，開設許多紗廠。他如一爿織麻廠和一家電力廠的機器，也將向俄國購買。這筆借欵並不起什麽利息，而是預備用土耳其的物產，分二十年攤還的。會藝游倫麥壇藝  乙丁　　上海的游藝會，本來是專供老爺太太們開心的，不要說入塲劵的價目，是貴得與我們這些小店員半個月的生活費不相上下，卽所表演的節目，也合不來我們的胃口，譬如，什麽「歌」啦，什麽「舞」啦，無非是一種色肉的炫耀而已。但麥倫游藝會却完全不是這樣，麥倫游藝會實在値得我們出一塊錢去看看。　　我看的是六月三十日的晚塲，那是一個天氣非常熱的日子，會塲很小，在八仙橋靑年會二樓的一角，當我第一步踏進去的時候，幾乎又想退了出來，因爲我直覺到這是一件冒險的事。倘使觀衆太擁擠了，那便不熱死，也要悶死的。然而，終於因受不住游藝節目睥吸引。和不願輕輕抛掉一塊錢的緣故，僅猶豫了一回又坐下來了。　　游藝節目是很多的，不過，因爲時間關係，除中華口琴隊合奏口琴外，只演了兩個劇本；「出走後的娜拉」和「揚子江的暴風雨」。現在，且把我對於這兩個劇本的意見寫下一點。　　「出走後的娜拉」是一個三幕劇。作者異常聰明地把最近發生的有特殊社會意義的幾件事連綴起來。組成一幅反帝反封建的序幕，給觀衆以親切的實感。這點聰明，我以爲是一切編劇者所應該效法的。這劇本的意義，是指出現社會一個有知識的女子應該怎樣才能求得解放。在第一幕内，借着伊蘭農民的事變，指出要求解放必須堅决的反帝；爲了反帝，可以堅决的抛棄家，抛棄最親愛的丈夫，如果丈夫墮落到有當漢奸的危險。第二幕内借着秦理齋夫人服毒的事變，指出舊社敎的吃人罪惡，要求解放，必須堅决的從封建社會舊禮敎的束縛中逃出。至第三幕，於是觸到女子職業問題，在這失業恐慌襲擊着全世界的時代，像那樣的太太到好裏去找職業呢？於是這裏指出要與勞働婦女携手，要降低自己的生活，要能與勞働婦女同樣吃苦。這實是目前中國婦女解放運動的南針，易卜生所未解决的問題，是完全正確的在這裏解决了。　　關於演出方面，我以爲最成功的，是飾太太的胡萍和那飾母親的角色，胡萍在第一幕内那堅决的表情，是很能使人興奮的。第二幕則以母親演來最爲動人，那種頑固和深沉的性格，都能恰當地表現出來，尤其是他的說白和動作，能隨着劇情的緊張與鬆弛，絲毫没有過火和不及之處，其次是飾兒子的趙丹，活潑俏皮，以及服毒後慘澹的掙扎，都充分表現出了他的特有天才。最成爲缺點的是第三幕幾位飾病人的演員，說白旣不淸楚，且又完全没有劇容，以致全劇减色不少。且當他們要出病院時，那來看太太的丈夫，在爆竹聲中不知在什麽時候從眼底溜下了塲，這也是其中缺點之一。　　「揚子江的暴風雨」，這是一幕歌劇，完全是一種新的形式。作者以反帝作骨幹，使碼頭上三種不同的工人統一在反帝的陣綫上，唱出了最後的反抗的呼聲。在演出方面，是比前者更成功，每一演員從各種不同的表情中表現了他們的力量。這劇本，如果舞臺是轉動的，當他們高唱着反抗之歌時，當更能顯露出那種激昻前進的英勇氣槪。　　看完了這個劇，我異常滿，足地完全不覺得熱似地走出了會塲。科學救國蘇聯的化學工人  文雄　　化學在蘇聯國民生產的各部門中現佔着很重要的地位。因爲這是和人造肥料與人造化合物的製造丨丨用以剿滅農田上一切害蟲和獸類的丨丨鉀和淡氣化合物，木料中的人造　維等的生產，良質化學煤（混合的和燃燒的油類）的生產，顏料，建築材料等等的生產有關係的。　　戰前俄國的化學企業，祇做到推銷外國商品的工作，不能滿足社會的需要。迨社會主義國家成立以後，時常發生對於肥料更多要求的欲望，因而新的化學工廠極重要地被建設起來了。「國家集體化，國家要求人造肥料的生產」這口號，給農民相信人造肥料的功用。現在在新法耕作中的農民自己已經瞭解人造肥料的利益了，因爲用這種肥料可以擴大他們的收　範圍，同時使他們容易工作。　　爲了滿足各種需要，極重要地生產了幾百萬噸的人造肥料。在帝俄時代從輸入的半製品中還不能產出二十萬噸的流酸，現在僅僅在列寗格勒的一個化學工廠中就已能生產超過二十萬噸的這種化學品了。在烏拉爾工廠中生產四千噸的硫黃，而這種產品在不久以前還要從外國輸入的。鮑布里基和渦斯克列辛斯基兩處的廠已經在歐洲起了極大的作用。一九三三年人造肥料的生產與一九二九年相比成爲一百與七四之比。這種化學品在價格方面所表現的，一九二九年各種化學品的總生產價格爲二四三、○○○、○○○盧布，一九三一年爲四五○、○○○、○○○盧布、一九三二年達九三五、○○○、○○○盧布。　　和化學工業的發展並進的是工人數量上的增加。一九二七丨丨二八年蘇聯在化學工業方面的失業工人爲二五，○○○人，一九二九年爲一一、○○○人、到一九三一年化學工業的失業工人已經完全肅淸了。一九三一年在化學工業中工作的工人有一四九、三四九人；一九三四年人數增加到二四○、○○○人。因此在三年中安插在化學工業中的工人竟達九萬人。　　在蘇聯，新的技術和生產的合理化不致使工人减不物現象繼起發生。完全相反的，當鮑布里基，柏殊斯尼基和渦斯克列辛斯基等處的巨大化學工塲依照最近代的技術被作用和被建造起來的時候，失業同時也消滅了。新的技術使工人極容易的完成工作；同時，在蘇聯工作時間也己縮短至六丨丨七小時，也有幾處甚至縮至四小時，和生產的發展同時增大的是工錢。僅僅一九三二年與一九三一年相比，焦煤化學工人的工錢就已增加五八％，基本化學增加三八％。一九三一年一個工人一月中的平均工錢是一○三盧布；一九三二年增加到一三一盧布，一九三三年達一三九盧布。　　工資在間接上和名義上也都有增加。這就是城郊生產（ＡｐｒｄｕｒｂａＮａｓｔｒｕｍｏ）的組織，使工人有獲得廉價肉類，乳類，牛酪，蔬菜等等的機會。一九三二年工人從城郊生產中獲得一七○、○○○噸乳類，一三六噸肉類和四七八噸蔬菜。爲了要輔助城郊生產，使工人生活情况改善，一九三三年僅僅化學工人的職工會就已拿出一、四○○、○○○盧布作爲補助費。　　蘇聯化學工業的主要地帶是在烏拉爾的無人居住的森林中和中部俄羅斯的草原上；因此和工廠的建設同時建設起來的是社會主義的城市。在柏列尼斯基的濃密的森林和展開在未被耕種過的荒原上，現在成爲有人口三四○、○○○人的城市了。爲了要在化學工業的中心建設城市，一九三一年支出三四、○○○、○○○盧布，一九三二年七九、○○○、○○○盧布，這些欵項是作爲在一九三三年建築二六○、○○○立方米突最舒適的住舍之用的。　　社會保險是專政期内有力的組織。這個組織的基金估値起來在四五址億盧布，是勞働人民委員會和職工會中央蘇維埃合併以後由職業組織中轉交出來的。化學工人的工會從這筆欵項工獲得七九、○○○、○○○盧布、分配給每一會員。　　在發生疾病的時候，工人能領到六個月的完全工錢。一九三二年曾爲疾病工人支出七九二、五七七日的工錢計三、四七八、○○○盧布，就是每一工人平均有四、○五日分配到。每年有很多的療養院，休息室，醫室，由工人任意使用。去年在這種療養機關調養身體的工人有二五、五八二人。明年的人數還要增加到二九、四二二人。　　在蘇聯，婦女有各種權利完全像男子一樣參加着各種建設工作，她們能够完全和男子没有區别的當個鎖匠或是當個人民委員。她們在廠中工作的時候完全解脫家主和小孩撫養者的束縛，因　這種解脫，使女子完全獲得在能力上與男子同　進化的可能性。在化學工業方面工作的四八、○○○個女子中、一九三二年生了二、一○○個小孩。做母親的獲得姙娠及生產的時期總數一五五、○○○日的工錢計五六八、九九六盧布。當哺乳及爲小孩預備心需物的時期，每個母親能領到額外的維持費七五盧布。除了這以外每個母親還以獲得一天一小時爲小孩哺乳的請假時期。又爲了要使撫養小孩的工作更容易解决起見，每個工廠都組織了兒童看撫所和兒童室，工作的女子當她自己在工所裏工作的時候，只要把她的兒童寄養在裏面好了。一九三二年化學工人的職工會爲改善兒童室支出一二、○○○、○○○、盧布。設立在工塲中的食堂，更使婦女解脫回家預備飯食的麻類。　　到一九三二年爲止，專爲化學工人開辦的學校計四十八塲建設完竣；在這裏讀書的有二四、○○○學生。一九二九年開辦了十所的高等化學學校，一九三二年已經開辦了十七　　學生在讀書的全部時間内還能得到津貼費。這種津貼費是極爲充實的，使學生能在學習期間只要專心於學問，不必另外去找額外民入來維持生活。　　新建的俱樂部作成了工人文化休息和社會敎育的中心地方。在柏列尼斯基的化學工廠的俱樂部有一所可容納一千一百個客人的大廳，和一所可容納三百人的劇塲，四十間各種式樣的讀書和開研究會用的房間，兒童廳，物理文化廳（運動用），外國工人和專家各廳，技師客廳，技術客廳等等。也有一所可容納一千五百觀衆的音樂電影院。工人在俱樂部中可自由地休息和游玩，而他們所必需的知議和技能，也是大部份在這裏學成的。　　俱樂部和學校的開辦也像對於工人工錢的附加一樣，提高了工人失基本工錢。時事研究對於德國事變應有的認識  諶松節　　（一）·········（一）　　六月卅日，德國突然發生一件驚人的事變，希特勒以斷然的處置加於若干在過去數年中號爲國社黨基幹的挺進隊的領袖。關於這一件事，各電訊社所傳的消息紛紜，各國報紙的評論也極不一致。有的歌功頌德，以爲希特勒眞不失爲當代的偉大人物，能以大義滅親，安定德國政局；有的則謂這些驕奢淫逸的挺進隊领將袖都是希特勒一手培養起來的。他這樣一來恰足以暴露國社黨自身的醜態。第一種的輿論多見之德國國内，那是在槍桿壓迫下發出來的，不足爲據；第二種則見之法國和美國的報紙，也祇是一種洩憤的醜詆，并未抓住事實的中心，在中國雖也有幾家報紙對之作懷疑的論調。大槪都離事實很遠。　　消息和議論旣如此龐雜，新聞紙的讀者自難得事實的眞相，作者不敏，願就兩年來研究德國國社黨的一點心得貢獻給大家。　　（二）··········（二）　　「狡兎死，走狗烹！」本來是一種政治上的慣例。德國「六卅」事變也不無這麽一點意味，不過這點意味是很輕微的。實際上是由於挺進隊靑年中堅分子對於希特勒日趨右傾之不滿。這種不滿原已醖釀多少日子，因爲其初希特勒在德國的政權未能如今日之穩定，而且這些返對分子也多少接受一點商量，所以未成事變。自去年年底以後，希特勒在表面上得到了全國國民的擁護。其所以如此，這一班小資產階級出身的挺進隊員呌囂之功固居一部分，然大資產階級之漸認希氏可爲一種政治工具而予以絶大之助力實爲一主因。於是希特勒與德國　　以下接第五版</p>

<p>大資一家問的關係，較之去年三月初獲政權時更見密切起來，這樣，從前挺進隊員藉以號召羣衆的那些所謂「社會主義」性的政綱，便立刻失掉「兌現」的作用了。因之上級領導機關和下級工作及宣傳的機關常起齟齬。挺進隊中的靑年領袖在奪取政權時，所憑藉以與敵黨鬥爭的主要工具爲抓住各工廠的工廠委員員。但是爲了在工廠中取得工人的信用起見，自不能不多少以工人羣衆利益爲立塲和廠主發生必有的爭執，甚至發生劇烈的衝突。矛盾因以嚴重起來。一個政黨要同時代表工人的利益又要勾結資本家是辦不到的。而况還有他種主義的關係。卒因大資一家所給希氏的利益對於國社黨的實際用處要大得多，希特勒的態度乃事實上愈益趨於右傾。去年六七月之交，國社黨的領袖希特勒，列伊（勞動前綫隊大隊長），施密特（經濟部長），額爾（司法部長）等，均曾先後發表文章及重要談話，禁止工人侵及工廠管理權，確定企業主爲工廠之當然領袖，以保護大資本家的利益。於是國社黨不僅實際上離開了工人，且成了大資本家壓迫工人的工具了。國社黨内部的分裂遂成爲不可或免的事實。　　（三）···················（三）　　這裏，對於國社黨在去年一月奪取政權前所宣佈的「社會主義」性的政綱條文抄錄一點，便讀者更明白該黨前後矛盾到個什麽程度。　　該黨下綱第十條至二十一條是這樣寫着；　　（十）國民之第一義務必須從事精神的或體力的勞動。·········　　（十一）廢除不勞而獲之收入，撲滅「利息的奴隸制」。　　（十二）····一切因戰爭所獲之贏利須完全没收。　　（十三）吾人要求凡形成「聯合公司之大企業」（指托辣斯）收歸國有。　　（十四）吾人要求在大企業中參加利潤之分配。　　（十五）吾人要求對於「養老恩給」之大量改良。　　（十六）吾人主張將「大百貨公司」立卽收歸市區公有，而將其房屋以低價租與小商人。　　（十七）吾人要求製定一種「無代價而没收土地之法律」，廢棄土地租金。且阻止各種土地投機。　　（十八）反對利盤剝者········。　　（十九）吾人要求以德意志之「普通法」代替以實利主義的世界秩序之「羅馬法」。　　（二十）爲使每個有才幹及勤勞的德國人能受高等敎育起見，應根本改革德國的國民敎育制度。　　（二十一）國家爲增進國民之健康計，對於母及幼童須加以保護，并禁止幼年勞役。　　這些政綱對於促成希特勒掌握德國的政權，都發生過甚大的作用。但是在他執政一年半以後的今日，德國企業之嘉提爾化愈趨顯著；加以小商業之禁止，大資本家之被任用爲政府機關重要人員，···等，這些政綱早已丢到字紙簏中去了！（參看南京正中書店出版勞動季報第一期二十三頁）　　（四）···········（四）　　這一次的事變顯然是這些矛盾所醖釀成功的。希特勒旣不惜違反他自己所領導的政黨的莊嚴的政綱，更何吝惜殺死幾十個曾共患難的「同志」呢。現據報載被捕者已達三千餘人，被害人數尙未有確實的報告。希特勒因爲這次事變的功續將更深的投入大資本家的懷抱中爲其工具。但是，他的下層其礎却已完全　去了。我以爲他在　近最多能成爲英國麥克唐　爾第二，否則就是他　　　到了！請失業朋友注意　　現代文化服務社刻疑招請推銷員及廣告員數人，原有職業者亦可兼職，願就者請至四馬路二八六號現代文化服務社與陳士敖君接洽。　　某小學托聘暑期補習班敎員一位，不拘性别，須能担任國英算三科，如有豐富敎育經騐者得連聘爲下學期級任敎師，願就者請開詳細履歷函寄新閘路永壽里十號曹宅。　　某校需添聘男女敎員各一位，須師範或中學畢業，有意者請卽日携親筆自薦書備述經歷專長科目及需要薪金數目至法租界西門路一七五號與張君接洽。　　某宅擬聘中學程度或師範畢業女敎師一位，專敎小學程度子女數人，應徵者請開明詳細履歷及最低薪水數目，投函貝勒路貝勒里十四號謝君收。</p>

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Left Nanjing for Lushan Yesterday; Hosted a Farewell Banquet for Key Figures Before Departure; Going to Lushan to Oversee Military Officer Training; and Will Convene a Bandit Suppression Conference</h3>

<h3>Wang Received Yang Dezhao</h3>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Will Announce the Reasons for Revising Tax Rates</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the announcement of the new tariff on imports, local industries and businesses have come to ask for relief in order to seek remedy. In order to explain the misunderstandings of all parties, the Ministry of Finance plans to announce the reasons for revising the tax rates in the coming days. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the announcement of the revised tariff on imports, various industrial and commercial circles have called for relief, saying that it affects national products. According to the person in charge of the Executive Yuan, the import taxes on cotton yarn, paper, sugar, and other items reduced in this new tariff are said to affect national products, which seems to be an overestimation. In fact, what affects national products is foreign merchants setting up factories in China. For example, Japanese yarn factories produce yarn and cloth in Japan and transport it to China. Although their import taxes are reduced, it is not as profitable as Japanese merchants setting up factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places to avoid import taxes. Therefore, the fundamental problem lies in prohibiting foreign merchants from setting up factories in China. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be achieved overnight. It is still under planning. According to the observation of the Executive Yuan, the newly revised tariff on imports is unlikely to destroy the livelihoods of domestic merchants. It is currently believed that there is no need to revise this tariff immediately. After a considerable period of implementation, the extent of its impact will be studied before revising the method. However, it can be said that if it is deemed necessary to revise it, it will be revised directly. There are no plans to implement any special taxes because China's customs duties are autonomous and it has the right to weigh whether to revise or not. As for the case of Guangdong Province implementing special taxes on foreign goods, the central government has received a simple telegram, but the detailed report has not yet been received, but it is expected that the principle of collecting special taxes on foreign goods will be difficult to establish. In short, the new import tariff is more reduced than last year, but the number of reduced parts is not reduced compared to the tariff from the year before last. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Police on the Beijing-Shenyang Train Will Be Immediately Withdrawn; Security Along the Beijing-Nanjing Railway Will Be Strengthened</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) This afternoon, the Beijing-Nanjing Railway Bureau replied to the Ministry of Railways with a telegram. The telegram did not mention the name of the Railway Bureau and did not express any views on the Ministry's telegram of retaining the three bureau chiefs, Yin Tong and others. It only stated that regarding the tea dregs bombing incident, the Railway Bureau had ordered the police to conduct a thorough search for the criminals and ensure that they were arrested and brought to justice. Important and dangerous locations along the railway line, such as bridges, are guarded by a large number of police. The Beijing-Nanjing Railway Bureau received a telegram from the Ministry of Railways today ordering the army department of the Japanese Garrison to send troops to escort the Beijing-Shenyang train and quickly negotiate a withdrawal in accordance with the oral agreement between the two parties that the Japanese police would ride along the train for a week. The Railway Bureau sent Bao Xuefan, the chief of the Transportation Section, to meet with Meijin, the commander of the Japanese Garrison. Meijin happened to be in Beijing and was represented by Chief of Staff Kikuchi, who replied that the withdrawal would be decided on the 8th and no more police would be sent to escort the train. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong still did not go to the bureau to work today. According to the person in charge of the Railway Bureau, Yin has private matters to attend to and will be able to come to the bureau next week. After receiving the Ministry's telegram, Yin has sent a reply telegram regarding the arrest of the murderer, but did not mention whether he would resume his post. The Beijing-Nanjing Railway Bureau has negotiated with the army department of the Japanese Garrison in North China to withdraw the police escorting the Beijing-Shenyang train, and has obtained permission from the Japanese side. On the 7th, a public letter signed by Chief of Staff Kikuchi was sent to the Railway Bureau stating that the police escort would be withdrawn on the 8th and hoping that the Railway Bureau would be fully responsible for the security on the train. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Beijing-Nanjing Railway Bureau received a telegram from the Ministry of Railways retaining the three bureau chiefs, Yin Tong and others. The original text of the telegram stated: "To Yin Tong, Director of the Beijing-Nanjing Railway Bureau, Xu Wenguo, and Zheng Baozhao, Deputy Directors: We have received your secret telegram regarding the bombing conspiracy, which should be strictly investigated to ensure the arrest of the criminals, and the railway police should be responsible for strict precautions for future trains. The resignation of the bureau chiefs and others should not be discussed. It is urgently telegraphed for your compliance. Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways." (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) After the Beijing-Shenyang train was attacked in Hangu, the Railway Bureau has recently received reports from Tangshan, Luanzhou, and other sections that some people plan to destroy railway bridges. The Railway Bureau has dispatched a number of railway protection teams and police to the Luanhe Railway Bridge and important locations along the line to take precautions and implement a curfew after 9 p.m. every night, cutting off the passage of pedestrians. Traffic on the Guandong section of the train has also been stepped up recently. Before the Beijing-Shenyang train departs, an armored train will be dispatched from Shanhaiguan to pave the way. The train is equipped with flat-firing cannons and machine guns. Japanese troops are stationed at various stations in the Guandong section, including Qian Suo, Suizhong, Lianshanwan, Dahu Mountain, and Juliuhe. Each station has three electric small rail cars for emergency precautions. The inspection of passengers at various stations on the pseudo-Fengshan Railway is very strict. When passing the Shanhaiguan Railway Station, the pseudo-police are not allowed to carry small packages and must hand them over to the baggage car for safekeeping and transportation. The inspection of young passengers is particularly strict. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is rumored that postal service will continue to be negotiated and implemented. According to reports, the Beijing-Shenyang train is carrying a large number of mail items from Guandong, which is tantamount to a disguised postal service. A reporter from a certain agency met with Zhu Jiaju, Minister of Transportation, to inquire about his opinion on this matter. Zhu said "It's not good to talk about it." (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Japanese People Discovered in Baoding and Other Counties</h3>

<p>The Tianjin Municipal Government's Protest is Ineffective</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The land occupied by the new barracks of the Japanese soldiers in Tianjin's Haiguang Temple was leased under the false name of a traitor who leased the land rights to the Japanese side. The Tianjin Municipal Government has protested twice, but to no avail. This case is the same in nature as the occupation of the concession by the Japanese lease land in Balitai. The authorities have no way to negotiate and will classify it as a pending case in North China. After Huang Fu returns, he will conduct a general negotiation with Japan. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>After Reading the Savings Bank Law</h3>
<p>In recent years, among the financial industry laws and regulations in our country that have taken shape, the most notable is the Banking Law passed by the Legislative Yuan on February 28th of the 20th year of the Republic. However, it still has many shortcomings. Although it has been passed, it has not yet been implemented. However, in recent years, it has become increasingly common for ordinary banks in our country to also engage in savings business. As this trend has grown, even ordinary stores such as department stores and pharmacies have also engaged in savings business. This kind of overextension has reached its extreme. In the spring of the 20th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Finance issued an order to crack down on it. On the one hand, the Ministry also adopted a gradual supervisory policy for banks that had been allowed to operate freely. At that time, the call within the country for the government to promulgate savings bank laws and regulations was also growing louder day by day. This is because the business of savings banks has a deep and close relationship with society. Therefore, the importance of establishing savings bank laws and regulations is even greater than that of ordinary banks. Generally, the relationship between ordinary banks and society is mostly direct with industrial and commercial operators. However, the relationship between savings banks and society mostly occurs directly with the lower classes. There are precedents in various countries for enacting special laws and regulations. The content of what we call ordinary banking laws and regulations today is not yet complete, and there are no savings bank laws and regulations at all. As for the savings bank regulations of the Qing Dynasty, judging from today's actual situation, they can no longer be applied.</p>
<p>In March of the 20th year of the Republic, I took advantage of the Ministry of Finance's plan to crack down on stores concurrently operating savings businesses. Considering that at that time, banks concurrently operating savings businesses did not have clear regulations, I strongly advocated in the article "Thoughts on Cracking Down on Stores Concurrently Operating Savings Businesses" that the authorities should learn from the past lessons. In the future, strict regulations should also be imposed on banks that concurrently operate savings businesses. It was stated, "Any bank that wishes to concurrently operate savings business must, in addition to registering as a bank, separately allocate capital and establish separate articles of association. It should be declared that the directors and managers bear complete unlimited liability. The investment methods and asset and liability accounts should be submitted to the government on a regular basis and made public to society before they can be approved to operate. Banks in the form of limited liability companies cannot accept savings deposits for which they are liable with unlimited liability. Companies registered in foreign countries must re-register with the competent authorities of the Chinese government, otherwise they cannot be recognized as limited liability companies." Recently, after Mr. Ma Yinchu proposed at the National Financial Conference to crack down on prize-linked savings institutions, the government also realized the urgent need to promulgate the Savings Bank Law. On June 22nd, the Legislative Yuan amended and passed 17 articles of the draft Savings Bank Law. According to the savings bank regulations, the main provisions that can be cited in advanced countries are: (1) restricting the name of the savings bank to prevent abuse; (2) the business should be regulated; (3) the capital should be limited; (4) the operation should be restricted; (5) the methods and amounts of loans should be restricted; (6) the articles of association cannot be arbitrarily changed; (7) the directors and supervisors bear unlimited liability; (8) strict penalties should be set; (9) the business should be made public. All of these are intended to ensure the stability of the savings bank business and the protection of the general social economy. Henry Duncan, the founder of American savings banks, said, "Savings are to use small amounts of money, using self-help methods, in accordance with sound and profitable principles, to prepare for emergencies." Niven, an American savings bank expert, said, "The importance of interest rates, no matter what, is always less than that of the principal. Although the accumulation of interest over time can also be considerable, savings are ultimately not about the accumulation of interest, but about the accumulation of principal." From this, we can see that the most important iron rule for operating a savings business is to use self-help methods to seek sound profits and to value the safety of the principal, rather than competing for high interest rates. After reviewing the entire 17 articles of the new Savings Bank Law, it covers everything in detail and the arguments are well-considered. In principle and in practice, it can be said to be appropriate and precise. In particular, Article 7 stipulates the methods of using funds. Items 7 and 8 regarding mortgage loans to rural cooperatives and loans secured by agricultural products are most critical in the current situation of social and economic decline and deteriorating rural conditions. Articles 12 and 15 repeatedly affirm the responsibilities of the directors and supervisors of savings banks. This is a great warning to the few financial institutions that still operate savings businesses today and still try to avoid responsibility in their regulations. However, the meaning of Article 1 of the law seems to be slightly ambiguous. Therefore, according to my humble opinion, it is proposed to divide it into Articles 1 and 2 as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The following businesses are savings banks:</p>
<p>(1) Deposits with interest calculated using compound interest methods.</p>
<p>(2) Irregular deposits of less than ten yuan at a time, but the total amount shall not exceed ○○ yuan or more. (3) Fixed-term deposits with regular installments, but the amount of each deposit shall not exceed ○○ yuan or more.</p>
<p>(4) Fixed-term deposits with lump-sum deposits and regular withdrawals, but the amount of each deposit shall not exceed ○○ yuan or more.</p>
<p>Article 2: Those that meet the provisions of Article 1 but are not called savings banks.</p>
<p>The amount restrictions in each item of Article 1 are transferred to Article 1 from the provisions of each item in Article 5. This seems easier to understand, and Article 5 can be omitted. At the same time, Article 4 can be revised as follows:</p>
<p>Article ○: In addition to the various businesses stipulated in Article 1, savings banks may also engage in the following businesses:</p>
<p>(1) Custody business.</p>
<p>(2) Collection of payments and remittances.</p>
<p>(3) Agency for buying and selling marketable securities.</p>
<p>(4) Collection and payment of funds for public welfare organizations and cooperatives.</p>
<p>(5) Notice deposits for public welfare organizations and cooperatives.</p>
<p>The prohibition of prize-linked savings is also one of the features of the law. According to Mr. Ma Yinchu's speech, the law is expected to be implemented in mid-July. As for whether it can be implemented, let us put it aside for now. However, after implementation, measures should be taken to crack down on prize-linked savings institutions. Otherwise, the treatment of Chinese and foreigners would be extremely unfair. Moreover, if these institutions are allowed to grow, it will be difficult to reverse the situation in the future, and it will be even more difficult to crack down on them. This would be completely contrary to the original intention of promulgating the Savings Bank Law this time.</p>
<h3>TSUKOSHI's Joining the Cabinet and the Formation of the OKADA Cabinet; Negotiations with Political Parties Have Come to an End, but the Seiyukai Still Refuses to Cooperate</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Okada Cabinet's work of forming a cabinet was temporarily frustrated due to the Seiyukai's refusal to join the cabinet. However, as a result of Tsukoshi and two of his party members agreeing to join the cabinet, the situation took a sharp turn for the better. Tonight, a decision was made on all the cabinet members. Prime Minister Okada is scheduled to meet with the Emperor tomorrow morning to present the list of cabinet members. The appointment ceremony will be held at 11:00 a.m. (Jiji News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Riverada, the vice minister of colonial affairs and the staff member of Okada's cabinet formation, announced at 11:00 a.m. this morning that three members of the Seiyukai and two members of the Minseito will be included in the cabinet. The candidates will be summoned to the cabinet formation headquarters today. (Jiji News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tsukoshi Takejiro of the Seiyukai decided to join the cabinet regardless of the Seiyukai's attitude towards the government. If Tsukoshi's entry into the cabinet is realized, two of the three members of the Tsukoshi faction - Akita Kiyoshi, Yamazaki Tatsunosuke, and Uchida Shinya - will be selected to join the cabinet. It is expected that there will be no problems with the political parties and the cabinet can be formed today. (Jiji News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<h3>List of Okada's Cabinet</h3>

<h3>Abolition of the Colonial Affairs Ministry Rumor</h3>
<p>(Dalian) It is rumored that the newly appointed Prime Minister Okada intends to abolish the Colonial Affairs Ministry. The Kwantung Government, the South Manchuria Railway Company, and general merchants are alarmed by this, because after the abolition of the Colonial Affairs Ministry, they will be under the jurisdiction of the army. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<h3>The Seiyukai Splits Again; President Suzuki Refuses to Join the Cabinet, but the Tsukoshi Faction Advocates Participation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Suzuki, the president of the Seiyukai, issued a declaration on the morning of the 7th, stating the reasons why he did not send party members to Okada's cabinet. The content is as follows: The current domestic and foreign situation requires the unity of the whole country. There has never been such an emergency as today. It is needless to say that those who bear the heavy responsibility of national politics must have the cooperation of political parties that represent the will of the country. However, the cabinet formed by General Okada despises political parties in its spirit of cabinet formation, and errors have occurred in its organizational policy. Our party hereby declares that it will not send party members to the cabinet and intends to contribute to the development of the country from its own unique perspective. (Jiji News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Suzuki, the president of the Seiyukai, visited Prime Minister Okada at the cabinet formation headquarters at 9:00 a.m. on the 7th because the Council of Elders decided to leave the attitude towards the government to his discretion. He told Okada that the Seiyukai had decided to adopt the principle of right and wrong and would not send party members to the cabinet. The meeting lasted only five minutes before he left. (Jiji News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai held a Council of Elders meeting on the evening of the 6th to discuss the attitude to be taken towards the Okada cabinet. Because the elders were unwilling to send members to a cabinet that despised political parties, they advocated adopting the principle of right and wrong and not assisting the new cabinet. The discussion continued until late at night. As a result, it was decided to leave the problem to Suzuki, the president, for resolution. The meeting then dispersed. Before the Council of Elders meeting, Tsukoshi met with the Prime Minister Okada's special envoy, Mr. Kayama, the former Director of the Public Works Bureau of the Railway Ministry. Because Mr. Kayama earnestly requested Tsukoshi to join the cabinet and take the post of Communications Minister, he agreed to join the cabinet on the condition that the Seiyukai occupy three seats in the cabinet. Therefore, Tsukoshi advocated assisting the cabinet at the Council of Elders meeting. However, if the Seiyukai were to actually adopt the principle of right and wrong, Tsukoshi would have to leave the party. In that case, the Tsukoshi faction and those associated with Tsukoshi would also withdraw from the Seiyukai at the same time. From this point of view, if President Suzuki does not approve of the theory of assisting the cabinet, the Seiyukai will inevitably split. Tsukoshi Takejiro told reporters that Goto, the former Agriculture Minister, visited him on the morning of the 6th on behalf of Prime Minister Okada and asked for assistance to the new cabinet. He replied that if the government showed sincerity and increased the number of Seiyukai cabinet members, he would agree to join the cabinet. Later, before the Seiyukai Council of Elders meeting, Prime Minister Okada sent a special envoy, saying that the new cabinet's cabinet formation policy had decided on three Seiyukai cabinet members and two Minseito cabinet members. Because Prime Minister Okada accepted his proposal, he agreed to join the cabinet. The majority opinion at the Council of Elders meeting hoped to break ties with the cabinet. However, he alone advocated assisting the cabinet and coping with the current serious situation with national unity. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to leave it to the President to handle it well. However, he declared to everyone at the end of the meeting that he would adhere to his own views. Therefore, the two opinions are still opposed and have not been resolved. (Jiji News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Signs of division have already appeared within the Seiyukai. Secretary-General Wakamiya and key figures such as Ando Masazumi held a meeting at President Suzuki's house on the morning of July 7th to devise a plan to prevent division. Ando, upon hearing that Yamazaki Tatsunosuke and Uchida Shinya and others were unanimously leaving the party with Tsukoshi, visited the above people, requesting them to take their actions seriously and pleading with them to stop Tsukoshi from joining the cabinet. Wakamiya, Mido, and Ogawa visited Tsukoshi at 8:00 a.m. and requested him not to act rashly. (Jiji News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The government-affiliated faction of the Seiyukai opposed President Suzuki's statement and convened a meeting today. More than 30 people, including Kinoshita and Tsuzaki, attended. They resolved not to obey the party's decision to oppose joining the cabinet, actively assist the Okada cabinet, and encourage Tsukoshi Takejiro. According to the main figures of the liaison faction, if the Seiyukai expels them from the party on the grounds of disobeying the party's decisions, at least 170 or 80 people will withdraw from the Seiyukai. (Jiji News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 1:40 p.m. today, the new Interior Minister Goto visited Tsukoshi Takejiro and had a cordial discussion on various issues related to joining the cabinet. He left at 2:50 p.m. After the meeting, Tsukoshi said, "Nothing has been decided yet today. General Okada may also come to visit, so I intend to decide my attitude at his inquiry, at my leisure." (Dentsu dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tsukoshi Takejiro's postponement of whether to confirm his joining the cabinet now only awaits the Seiyukai's decision on the other two ministers. Therefore, Tsukoshi's entry into the cabinet seems to be a foregone conclusion. (Dentsu dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<h3>The Contradictions of Okada's Cabinet Formation: No Policy and No Money; The Burden of Leaving the Mountain Without Funds</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Admiral Okada, who was ordered to form a cabinet, is known as a frugal military man. On the day he was ordered, he decided to use all of his family's assets of 400 yuan as expenses for forming the cabinet and started his activities. However, he encountered difficulties due to the Seiyukai's obstacles and felt quite distressed. Fortunately, the Imperial Household Agency borrowed a car for his activities. However, the room tax for his residence at the Wanping Hotel is ten yuan a day, a bottle of whiskey is thirteen yuan (Okada is known as a heavy drinker), and the food expenses are six yuan. Because the weather is extremely hot, the daily cost of ice cream is three yuan, and the meals for the guards are around 20 yuan. The minimum daily expenses are 200 yuan. The 1,000 yuan in cabinet formation expenses raised by relatives and friends is almost used up. Okada said to Suzuki yesterday, "I have no policy," etc. However, it seems that what Okada lacks is not limited to policy. (Jiji News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<h3>The Minseito Agrees to Join the Cabinet</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada visited Ruoqi Reijiro, the president of the Minseito, at 10:15 this morning to report on his cabinet formation strategy and request assistance. After Prime Minister Okada met with Minseito President Wakatsuki this morning, he returned to the cabinet formation headquarters at 10:40 a.m. Machida Chuji and Matsuda Genji are strong candidates for joining the cabinet from the Minseito. Okada plans to visit Suzuki, the president of the Seiyukai, again today to request that the party send three members to the cabinet (Jiji News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Cabinet Reorganization and the Future of the Naval Conference</h3>
<p>(Washington) Naval circles here believe that the difficulty in forming a Japanese cabinet due to political issues may delay the opening of the naval arms reduction preparatory conference. Naval observers believe that it is better to temporarily suspend the conference and wait until the atmosphere in Tokyo clears before Japan can formally decide its policy and then reopen it. The inability of Prime Minister Okada to quickly form a cabinet has already invisibly delayed the negotiations between the British and American representatives in London, because the representatives of the two countries cannot make any formal decisions on Japan's proposals before the Japanese representatives arrive in London. Britton, the former chairman of the House Naval Committee and a Democratic congressman, told the Associated Press that if Japan insists on abolishing the existing naval ratio, the United States will implement the establishment of naval and air force protection bases on the American islands in the Pacific. Mr. Britton said that Japanese officials have recently repeatedly stated that they will demand the expansion of the navy at next year's naval conference. If so, the United States will also plan to increase armaments in the Philippine Islands, which are in the process of independence. The U.S. Army base in the Philippines will be abandoned upon independence, but President Roosevelt has said that the naval base will be finally decided only after the U.S. government and the Philippine government have established mutually satisfactory conditions. Mr. Britton believes that Japan's request to expand the navy has no clear reason. Although Japan has recently occupied Manchuria, the Chinese navy does not pose a threat to Japan, and the ratio of the Japanese navy to other countries has been very appropriate for several years. Therefore, its request is nothing more than wanting to dominate the Pacific. Since Japan has this intention, other countries should take precautions to avoid the same incidents as Manchuria from happening on their territories. The Philippines, Guam, and Honolulu are the most vulnerable to the tyranny of Japanese militarism. Therefore, in order for Japan to insist on its naval policy, these areas should be properly protected, and the Pacific islands currently administered by Japan should also be transferred to the United States or other countries for management. Now that the naval powers have begun preparatory meetings, the political situation in the Pacific will have a great impact on the naval ratio issue. The United Kingdom and the United States are expected to oppose Japan's expansionist demands. As for the theory that various countries and Japan have established a new treaty, Mr. Britton believes that for five years, Japan has regarded various treaties as waste paper. Its disregard for everything and its destruction of the lives and property of the Chinese people are the most obvious examples. (Guomin Daily dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It was learned today that the U.S. Navy Department plans to completely remove the torpedo equipment from the 10,000-ton cruisers. It is said that according to the improvement plan parallel to the Vinson's large naval bill, all Houston-class cruisers built before 1932 will completely abolish the torpedo equipment. Naval experts, after more than a year of experiments, have learned that the effectiveness of giant cruisers launching torpedoes is very poor, because the hull is too heavy and cannot turn freely. Therefore, naval experts believe that torpedoes are harmful to giant cruisers, because if enemy fire hits the torpedo, it will explode and damage the hull. Now the Navy Department plans to replace it with more practical equipment, but it must be within the limits permitted by the treaty. It is not yet certain what kind of equipment will be adopted.

<h3>Another Dispute Between Japan and Russia; Japanese Army Prank Protests Against Soviet Territory</h3>
<p>Berkley: According to news from Heihe, on the opposite bank of the Heilongjiang River in Hailanpao, the Japanese military police in the area suddenly opened fire with machine guns and rifles near the Soviet Consulate on June 28, lasting for a considerable period of time. There was no prior warning. The women and children inside the consulate were extremely panicked. The Japanese side later explained that the prank was a street fighting exercise, and this exercise was definitely held at that time. The Soviet Consul has lodged a verbal protest with the local Manchurian authorities. (TASS dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Baldwin Denies Anglo-French Alliance; Britain Still Opposes Mutual Assistance Pact</h3>
<p>(London) Lord President Baldwin, who is acting as Prime Minister, denied in the Lower House today that there is a trend towards an Anglo-French alliance. According to recent newspaper reports, General Weygand's return visit to England and British War Minister Halesham's return visit to France are the beginning of closer understanding between Britain and France. When French Foreign Minister Barthou visits London next week, he will discuss the alliance with the British authorities. Baldwin declared that Halesham's trip to France was purely to tour the battlefield, which is a common practice over the years and has no political odor. Labor MP Jones asked, "Does General Weygand's visit to England also have no political odor? Are the mutual visits of senior officials of the two countries without the 'honorary obligations' contained in the visits before 1934?" Baldwin replied, "No." This visit has no other purpose than what I have told you. (Reuters dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Daily Telegraph reported that the shortening of French Foreign Minister Barthou's visit to England was because the British Ambassador to France had previously informed Barthou of Britain's attitude. Britain is unwilling to negotiate anything further on matters already committed to in the Locarno Treaty, and Britain opposes any mutual assistance treaty. Therefore, Barthou's stay in London does not need to be very long. The Times said that Barthou's visit this time was not very important, because the task of Barthou's visit was to explain France's plans to the British authorities and not to ask Britain to join. The British government believes that the Locarno Treaty is the highest limit that the British nation can undertake. The Times repeated that negotiations between Britain and France on the alliance issue are not in question, because neither the British government nor the British people want to talk about the issue of the alliance, and there is no alliance of complete self-defense under the current situation in Europe. Before arriving in London, Barthou was very clear about this point, so his coming here was purely to explain France's plans or to report on the process of his activities in Central and Eastern Europe. The Times repeated that after Ms. Yi came here, she may re-engage in the restoration of political and military alliances to achieve its security goals, but Britain's policy is unwilling to take any active action. In the current turbulent situation in Europe, Britain has no other good strategy to abandon this. (Guomin Daily dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Brussels) The Belgian government has submitted a bill stipulating that the King of Belgium be authorized to rule the country by decree for seven months in order to implement economic and financial restoration and reduce public expenditures. However, changes to the currency law are not included in this. The King is also authorized to protect credit and trade and to relieve unemployment. If this case is passed by the parliament, the King of Belgium will in fact become a dictator. (Reuters dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>The Features of the Shi and Li Marriage in the London Embassy</h3>
<p>"London" The marriage of the son of Dr. Shi Zhaoji, the Chinese Envoy to the United States, and the daughter of the Shanghai banker Li Minzhi will take place tomorrow. At that time, Chinese and foreign guests will certainly gather. Those in the British Foreign Office and the London diplomatic corps who have friendship with Shi will all be present. Mr. and Mrs. Li Min arrived here from Shanghai on June 7, and Dr. Shi and Mrs. Shi also arrived here from the United States on June 12. It was suddenly discovered yesterday that the printed Chinese marriage certificate could not be purchased in England, so it was written by the Chinese Consul temporarily. The wedding will be held at the Chinese Legation. The legation is Chinese territory, so it is not necessary to follow British etiquette. The officiant will be Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Envoy to the United Kingdom. This is only the second time that a wedding has been held at the Chinese Legation. The bride will wear a Chinese-style silk dress in bright red, made by an American tailor. The bride, Ms. Li, told a Reuters representative: "I often wear Chinese clothes and will continue to do so in the future." (Special telegram from the Zilin Daily on July 6)</p>

<h3>Hitler's Domestic Affairs: Stormtroopers and Steel Helmets Compromise; New Chief of Staff Lutze Announces Reorganization of Party Army; 441 Killed or Missing in Incident</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The disagreement between the Stormtroopers (SA) and the Steel Helmets (Stahlhelm) was resolved today in a meeting between the new Stormtroopers Chief of Staff Lutze and Steel Helmets Commander Seldte. This is a key development since last week's incident. Commander Seldte announced the compromise solution to Steel Helmets leaders gathered for a special meeting. Commander Seldte told the conference that his meeting with Lutze had removed obstacles to sincere cooperation between the Stormtroopers and the Steel Helmets. The conference then closed with a unanimous shout of "Long live Hitler!" The Steel Helmets are also known as the National Socialist Front-Line Fighters League. In name, they have been incorporated into the Stormtroopers and serve as the reserve force for the Party Army.</p>
<p>(National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, the National Socialist Party's newspaper, *Völkischer Beobachter*, published an article entitled "The Future of the Stormtroopers," containing a statement by the new Stormtroopers Chief of Staff, Lutze. In the statement, Lutze declared that Stormtroopers members did not participate in Röhm's conspiracy. Therefore, last week's rebellion was entirely the private action of a small number of Stormtroopers leaders. The rebellion of these few individuals should not bring shame upon all Stormtroopers members. Furthermore, regarding last week's incident, the reorganization of the Security Squad is now a matter of urgent importance and must be carried out strictly in accordance with regulations. As for the details of the reorganization, Lutze was unable to announce them, only stating that everything must be completely refreshed. Lutze also indicated that during the internal refreshment of the Stormtroopers, the number of Stormtroopers members may decrease, which is also unknown. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The National Socialist Party's newspaper, *Der Angriff*, recently published the declaration of the National Socialist Party Stormtroopers Chief of Staff, Lutze, regarding the Party Army. Its content stated, "Although no Party Army members echoed Röhm's rebellious conspiracy, I believe that the reorganization of the Party Army is still a matter of popular demand." Following the aforementioned declaration, *Der Angriff* added a few words stating that Lutze's intention is to thoroughly purge the Brownshirt organization internally so that it becomes a completely reliable political tool of the Party. Therefore, as a result of the reorganization, the number of Party Army personnel may be reduced. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Germany's Anti-Russian Sentiment Intensifies</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The anti-Soviet propaganda movement within Germany has recently intensified, which is quite noteworthy. For example, the National Socialist Party's newspaper, *Völkischer Beobachter*, will soon publish a novel proving that a state of terror pervades the Soviet Union. German newspapers have widely published previews of this novel. Large advertisements have also been posted at newsstands throughout the capital, depicting a fur-clad woman wearing high boots, with a bewitching appearance, holding a gun in her hand, with lingering smoke from the muzzle. Behind the woman are many Cossack soldiers, whipping the poor, in a most tragic state. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, foreigners collecting reports from Berlin and various other places estimate that the total number of people killed or missing in Germany in the past week is 241. However, many of these have not yet been confirmed, and because the circumstances of many arrests and disappearances are very complex, this number may be far from the actual figure. The government's official list is in preparation. It is said that a total of 65 people were shot or committed suicide. Today, officials announced that three members of Vice-Chancellor Papen's staff have proven to be uninvolved in the conspiracy and have been released. Papen was initially suspected, but Chancellor Hitler has now restored his trust in him. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The rumor that Munich Bishop Faulhaber was arrested is unfounded. However, his residence is closely guarded by detectives, and those entering and leaving are interrogated and everything is recorded in detail. Faulhaber was sent by the Pope and therefore enjoys extraterritorial rights. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Barthou States French Diplomacy</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies convened to hear Foreign Minister Barthou's statement on diplomacy. Barthou first said that regarding the recent events in Germany, some people have fabricated rumors to slander France. In fact, these rumors are completely absurd and not worth discussing. Barthou then explained France's entire foreign policy, stating that the main purpose of French diplomacy is to utilize its full strength whenever and wherever there is a possibility of maintaining and safeguarding peace. This policy is closely linked to the principles of the League of Nations. Every action of the French government is based on this principle. Barthou then stated that after his visits to Poland and Czechoslovakia, he also visited Romania and Yugoslavia. The purpose of these visits was none other than to consolidate France's alliance with these countries, and the purpose of the alliance was none other than to seek peace without deviating from the scope of the League of Nations. Barthou continued, stating that France, the Soviet Union, and other related countries have conducted certain negotiations. These actions are based on the principle of "seeking peace whenever and wherever possible." These negotiations have not yet reached a sufficient level, so he cannot provide a detailed report at this time. However, in any case, the government will respect the power of congressional oversight. The Foreign Minister then briefly explained his talks with Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss in Vienna, and also said that on June 7 of this year, when he was in Geneva, British Lord Privy Seal Eden, representing Prime Minister MacDonald, invited him to London to meet with British authorities so that the understanding reached between the two countries that day could be further developed. He has already accepted this invitation and is preparing to go to London on the 8th of this month. The British Prime Minister is currently on leave due to eye problems, and he will not be able to meet with him on this trip. However, MacDonald sent a letter with extremely warm wording. It is expected that the main British cabinet members will meet with him in a tone of friendliness, just like the tone of the Prime Minister's letter. Barthou finally stated that his trip to London may not have immediate results, but the friendly relations between the two countries will be further consolidated as a result. The close relationship between Britain and France is one of the main conditions for peace. After Barthou finished speaking, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Basti thanked Barthou. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) The upcoming visit of French Foreign Minister Barthou to England is of great importance to public opinion. The *Times* believes that it is important for the French Foreign Minister to meet with British authorities, but there are two ways that should not be ignored. One is that "Britain and France are both guardians of culture," and the other is that "British politics must maintain a passive attitude for a certain period of time." The *Times* said that in the current state of division in Europe, the British government and public opinion are firmly opposed to the alliance policy, because alliance treaties, even if they are of a "defensive" nature, are inevitably drawn into war, as Foreign Secretary Simon recently stated to the House of Commons. The British representative to the Security Committee of the Geneva Disarmament Conference is prepared to participate, but the regional security agreements currently being discussed are unlikely to gain British approval. The British Cabinet believes that the Locarno Treaty has already contributed to international security and that there is no need to conclude other security treaties. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the *Daily Telegraph*, there have recently been two important developments in the diplomatic situation in Eastern Europe: "First, the Greek government does not intend to participate in any Mediterranean pacts that have not been signed by the British and Italian governments, fearing that such diplomatic institutions will lead to the formation of an anti-Italian alliance. Second, the Turkish government led by Kemal has realized that it cannot rely solely on its friendship with Soviet Russia and disregard other countries, so it has reached an understanding with Persia and will send a military delegation to Persia in the near future to seek friendship." (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Political observers in Bucharest believe that Romania is currently working to reform its military, which can be seen in the establishment of a separate armaments department by the Țătărescu government. Although the armaments department cooperates closely with the Ministry of War, it is independent and not bound by the Ministry of War. In addition to this, what is enough to show this trend is the trip of Armaments Minister Anghelescu and the recent visit of French General Béttin to Bucharest. Although officials say that General Béttin's visit is purely private, the general public still believes that the real reason for the two's activities is to implement the armaments plan drafted by the Romanian Ministry of War several years ago. The delay in implementing this plan is due to insufficient financial resources. Romania's finances are now exhausted, and the National Bank also has no large sums of money to fund this plan, so it can only rely on foreign forces. It is now rumored that this aid will arrive soon. Although there is no reliable news about this matter so far, it is rumored that the Krupp-Ehrhardt armaments factory has agreed to lend a large sum of money to Romania, which coincides with France's policy of assisting its Eastern allies. It has become an open secret that the Romanian Ministry of War has no money to maintain its standing army. In the past few years, some troops have sometimes sent one-third or even one-half of their soldiers back to their homes to feed themselves. The length of time they are sent back varies, so it is clear that there is a lack of funds to reform the military in this environment. In the past, public donations have also been raised, such as the special air force fund three years ago. It is said that 128 million lei were raised in December. Fundraising is still in progress, but no increase in aircraft has been seen. It is rumored that these funds have been used for other purposes. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Success or Failure of the Baltic States Alliance Movement Depends on the Relationship Between Lithuania and Poland</h3>
<p>The foreign policy of Reval, Estonia, has long advocated the conclusion of an alliance with Lithuania and Latvia. However, this effort has only been partially successful so far. That is, although Latvia has formed an alliance with Estonia, stipulating a common foreign policy between the two countries, Lithuania has not yet joined. It is believed here that the cooperation of the Baltic States will never be possible if this continues. The reason why Lithuania is unique is that Estonia and Latvia advocate that the Baltic Group should cooperate with Poland. However, since Polish troops occupied the Vilnius region in 1920, the conflict between Lithuania and Poland has suddenly become tense. Since then, the two countries have entered a state of war preparation. The border between the two countries has cut off transportation and commercial relations, and both have deployed heavy troops to guard it. Lithuania believes that since the two countries restored diplomatic and economic relations, public opinion has consistently prevented the realization of war. This can be seen as a symbol of Lithuania's abandonment of Vilnius. However, Baltic diplomats outside of Lithuania believe that cooperation with Poland alone is sufficient to safeguard the interests of the Baltic States. It is said that the non-aggression pact concluded by various countries with Soviet Russia has been very effective in terms of the security of the Baltic States, but the inter-state group of Baltic States led by Poland is of even greater value. Therefore, the main problem is to ease the hostility between Lithuania and Poland. Estonia is now working to facilitate this. Estonian Foreign Minister Seljamaa recently visited Warsaw, and former Polish Prime Minister Sławek also led a political delegation to Reval to return the visit. Both mentioned the issue of Polish-Lithuanian relations and learned that Estonia volunteered to mediate. It is said that the reconciliation method is to first gradually eliminate the state of war preparation, and then restore the commercial and diplomatic relations between the two countries. It is now known that the opportunity for reconciliation is better than before, first because Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia have abolished the parliamentary system. It is said that the same internal affairs are conducive to understanding foreign policy issues. Second, because the National Socialist Party is very active in Memel, the relations between Lithuania and Germany are tense, so Lithuania seems willing to change its attitude towards Poland.

<h3>Serious Labor Unrest in San Francisco; California National Guard Deployed</h3>
<p>San Francisco: The California National Guard today patrolled the San Francisco coast armed with live ammunition to prevent riots and stop the recurrence of cargo transportation incidents. The troops arrived three hours after the riots stopped yesterday, at which time the striking workers had dispersed. The National Guard commander ordered the troops to resist with bayonets before firing if attacked. The coastal area was still quiet today, but air freight vehicles were still attacked from time to time in more remote areas. Striking workers still gathered in groups at intersections to block the passage of cargo, so all perishable goods still dared not be transported to the areas where workers gathered. The strike committee asked various unions to join the general strike movement, but workers in various industries felt that the current strike seemed to be controlled by the Communist Party, so they all refused to join. The atmosphere of unease in the entire city is very obvious. If a general strike occurs, all businesses will be shut down. The San Francisco Dockworkers Union today received a notice from the Eastern Executive Committee of the International Dockworkers Union, stating that it has been decided to convene a special meeting next week to discuss whether to provide assistance to the Pacific coast strike. In the capital, the Ministry of Commerce is waiting quietly for developments and the authorities do not want to express any opinion. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>American Public Opinion Still Supports Roosevelt</h3>
<p>(New York) The "Literary Digest" magazine's referendum on public opinion concluded today.

The question was, "Do you approve, on the whole, of the policies pursued by President Roosevelt during his first year in office?"

Now, with the establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee, it was determined to complete the registration of smokers within three months, from June 1st to August 30th, and to completely eradicate opium addiction within four years. He emphasized that as long as there was determination, success was certain, adding that with hundreds of thousands of smokers in Jiangsu, it was a great disgrace. He urged all committee members and staff to act in accordance with their oaths, lead by example, and abide by the law to achieve the eradication within the set timeframe, thereby repaying the elders of Jiangsu. Smokers were also required to register within the prescribed period, with no leniency granted for those who failed to do so, and strict military law would be enforced for violations. He concluded by saying that the current anti-smoking effort was truly aimed at saving smokers, and that the ongoing registration was providing a path for smokers to reform. Smokers who failed to register within the deadline would be choosing their own demise. Subsequently, Gu Ziyang, Zhu Heping and others delivered speeches, followed by a response from Yu Jingtang on behalf of the committee.

<h3>Dissolution of the Saito Cabinet in Japan (Japanese Communication) Difficulties in Selecting a Successor After Saito's Resignation Okada Keisuke Accepts the Mandate After Discussions</h3>
<p>The Saito Cabinet has repeatedly replaced cabinet members, including the Army Minister, Navy Minister, Foreign Minister, and Minister of Commerce and Industry. In particular, the problems caused by the change of the Minister of Education were even greater, to the point that a successor could not be formally found. In desperation, Prime Minister Saito himself took on the additional role, which was indeed the most painful and the ugliest event in Japanese political history. The bribery case involving the Vice Minister of Finance implicated not only him personally, but also the Director of the Banking Bureau, making it a major corruption case in Japan. If this case does not expand further, then the Saito Cabinet can still continue with difficulty. This is not only Saito's personal matter, nor can it be said that Saito clings to power, but rather the elder statesmen want to support constitutional politics, to use naval relations to block the army's blind policies and to ease the rise of military politics, so they are supporting the Saito Cabinet as much as possible. However, the general Japanese public is indeed tired of the Saito Cabinet and absolutely does not want him to continue. Therefore, after the Kuroda case occurred, public opinion unanimously cursed him in a negative manner. At the same time, the Kuroda bribery case expanded to implicate former Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima Kumakichi, and thus the Saito Cabinet had to fall. However, finding a successor is extremely difficult. According to general speculation, the following people are qualified to accept the mandate to form a cabinet:</p>
<p>The first and most desired person is the Governor-General of Korea, Ugaki Kazushige. He is the successor of Tanaka Giichi and a political figure in the army. Although he often calls himself a military man, many people in the Minseito party, financial circles, and the House of Peers have expressed goodwill towards him. However, the military, especially the middle-ranking officers of the army, are not fond of him, and the navy is also affected. Therefore, when Sakano, the chairman of the Navy Popularization Committee, issued a statement of non-opposition to the Ugaki Cabinet, he was immediately dismissed. On the other hand, they are launching a movement to support Hiranuma to counter Ugaki.</p>
<p>The second most promising person is Hiranuma, because he has the support of the military, and he himself has right-leaning groups below the Kokuhonsha as his mass base. Isn't a true union of the military and the people invincible? However, we know that Japan is still a country with extremely strong feudal characteristics, and its financial capital is very developed. Although the strength of the political parties has been reduced, the financial groups are still powerful. They still have the power to advocate for their own interests and cannot allow the military to go too far beyond the scope. Moreover, the elder statesman, Prince Saionji Kinmochi, is a proponent of constitutional rule and is especially unwilling to completely abandon the constitution. Therefore, the obstacles that Hiranuma's cabinet will encounter are no smaller than those of Ugaki.</p>
<p>The third is a more moderate figure, Kiyoura Keigo. Politically, he can indeed express his detached attitude, neither biased towards fascism nor biased towards the private interests of political parties, and his virtue and prestige are also among the best of his time, so that people in the military cannot oppose him. He can also combine the strengths of Ugaki and Hiranuma and resolve the deadlock of opposition between the military and political parties. Therefore, many people thought that after the fall of the Saito Cabinet, Kiyoura should take the stage. However, Kiyoura is too old and cannot handle the heavy workload. He himself has firmly stated that he cannot take office, so the Kiyoura Cabinet is also difficult to materialize.</p>
<p>Next to Kiyoura is the current President of the Privy Council, Iki Kitokuro. He is a transcendent talent among modern Japanese politicians, and he is well-liked by both the military and the elder statesmen. If Iki takes the stage, it will be easier to reconcile the two political parties, and a so-called coalition cabinet will be easier to form. Because the Seiyukai cabinet, no matter how much absolute majority it has in the parliament, cannot control the political situation, and Suzuki's reputation is also very low, so apart from forming a coalition with the Minseito party, it is absolutely impossible to form a cabinet with one party alone. Therefore, they have to try to win over all parties to maintain the status quo. However, Iki has already taken office as the President of the Privy Council, and neither he nor the elder statesmen are willing to make changes in the short term.</p>
<p>Finally, the only relatively appropriate solution is to have Saito form a cabinet again. However, the responsibility issue of the Minister of Finance, the issue of discipline, etc., are fundamental contradictions, and the Saito Cabinet cannot but be extended. As a result, Okada Keisuke, an admiral from the navy, was selected to replace Saito. In fact, he seems to be a more suitable candidate than the people mentioned above and is sufficient to maintain the current political situation without causing overly drastic changes.

<h3>Sichuan Province Improves Tobacco Leaf Cultivation Jintang Tobacco is of Good Quality and Flavor, Not Inferior to Cigars Sichuan Silk Industry Remains Depressed, Tax Exemption Extended for Another Year</h3>
<p>Chengdu Airmail News: Since the opening of the sea, Luzon cigars and cigarettes have been sold very well in our country, with annual outflows of tens of millions of yuan or more. The sales of domestic tobacco leaves have been greatly impacted, leaving only small paths for laborers, farmers, workers, and small merchants. Even these small sales channels are gradually being taken away by imported tobacco products. Although domestically produced cigarettes have been able to recover some profits in recent years, the general gentry and official class still prefer to smoke expensive Luzon cigars, as well as Carlucks and Fortresses, which is their habit. As for the Jintang leaf tobacco produced in Sichuan (also known as Da Yan, brown in color, made into square or round sticks larger than cigarettes), which is sold in the western provinces and major ports such as Shanghai and Hankou, it has also been eroded by imported products. At this year's May Sichuan Provincial Production Conference, in view of this, it was decided to actively improve various native products in Sichuan and to promote the planting and improved manufacturing of Jintang tobacco leaves in order to resist foreign goods (Luzon cigars). The Native Product Improvement Association organized by the governor's office has already started working on this. The reason that the quality of our domestic tobacco leaves is not as good as imported ones is only because we stick to old methods and refuse to innovate, which has led to us falling behind. If we can work hard to study and improve manufacturing, it will not be difficult to replace foreign goods. I remember that when a Sichuan representative hired foreign petroleum experts to explore mines in Sichuan a few years ago, these experts were all very fond of cigars and had purchased and transported a large number of cigars from Shanghai. After being in Sichuan for a long time, they gradually ran out. These special smoking products of the wealthy gentry and foreigners (the general term for foreigners in Sichuan) were naturally impossible to buy in remote small towns, so they had to stop smoking for several days. Out of desperation, they tried smoking this Jintang Da Yan (its shape is very similar to cigars and different from ordinary cigarettes, so it is commonly called Da Yan). The taste was great, much richer than cigars, and the price was very cheap (about 200 sticks can be bought for one silver dollar). These foreigners abandoned cigars and specialized in smoking this kind of Jintang Da Yan. At the same time, they also advised the representative to raise funds to set up a large company to improve manufacturing in order to promote sales outside the province and abroad, so as to avoid the outflow of profits. The representative left Sichuan last winter and carried several boxes of this tobacco, inviting Chinese and foreign friends in Beijing and Shanghai to try it, and everyone praised it. Based on this, the representative telegraphed the Sichuan authorities to request improved manufacturing. At this year's May Sichuan Provincial Production Conference, this plan to improve tobacco leaves was passed into the five-year plan. Those who are unaware of the situation mistakenly call Da Yan (Jintang cigarettes) opium (a synonym for opium), saying that Sichuan is advocating the planting and improved manufacturing of opium. This is a ridiculous misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The Sichuan silk production was also discussed at the production conference, and it was decided to provide relief and support. The 21st Army Headquarters has recently issued a general order to all silk merchants to comply with the tax exemption for another year. The original order stated, "In order to order compliance, it is noted that the Sichuan silk industry is one of the most important international trades. In recent years, due to the impact of the world economic depression and the rapid progress and fierce competition of operators in various countries, foreign trade has been increasingly declining. The vast majority of men and women workers who depend on silk for their livelihoods have lost their jobs, which has severely affected the rural and social economy. In June of last year, this headquarters received the Sichuan Silk Reorganization Committee's proposed relief measures and immediately issued instructions to approve a temporary exemption of all donations and taxes on various silk cocoons transported from this province to the Yangtze River for export for one year to support silk merchants and provide relief, and issued separate notices for compliance. Now that the tax exemption period is about to expire, it is found that the world economy is still in a state of panic and the silk industry has not yet recovered. It is urgent to take further measures for relief. Therefore, the previous case is continued, and the various silk merchants who transport various silk merchants in this province from the Yangtze River for export will be exempted from donations and taxes for another year from July of this year. At the end of the period, the situation will be considered again, and another order will be issued for compliance in order to strengthen domestic products and maintain agriculture and industry. In addition to separate telegrams to the Tian and Yang army commanders to exempt them from donations and issue notifications, the combined action is to order the subordinates to comply immediately, and to report the handling situation for verification. Be sure to issue this order."</p>
<h3>Drought in Hubei Province, Torrential Rains in Zhongjiang and Xiangyang Two-Thirds of the Province is Affected by Drought Rising Water Levels Wuhan Actively Prevents Danger</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the beginning of summer this year, the climate has been extremely hot. In Wuhan, the temperature is often above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and epidemics are prevalent, with successive deaths. Except for northern Hubei, most counties have not had rain for a long time, and drought has affected two-thirds of the province. The harvest of cotton and beans is mostly hopeless, and the rice and paddy fields are also expected to have reduced yields. At this time of drought, torrential rains suddenly and simultaneously rose in the Yangtze and Xiang rivers. The water level of the Yangtze River is highest in Chongqing. According to a telegram from the Sichuan River Navigation Management Office, it has risen from 28 feet to 54 feet and 4 inches in the past three days, and is still continuing to increase sharply. The floodwaters of the Xiang River are even more intense, exceeding the highest water level in 20 years. As a result, the Wuhan water gauge has also increased without decreasing. On the 6th, it reached 40 feet and 4 inches. The Hankou river embankment is structurally sound, and there seems to be no danger at the moment. However, Wuchang is gradually entering a critical period. Half a month ago, seepage was discovered in Wutai Gate and other places. Recently, three leaks were also discovered in the gun emplacements inside the embankment near Xujiapeng. Many of the sleepers in the caves have rotted. The gate panels at Wannian Gate, Shaihu Dike Gate, Tongxiangmen Gate, and other places have been damaged. The water accumulated inside the Lao Sanyi Temple Dike cannot be discharged, and hundreds of households have been flooded nearby. The Provincial Flood Prevention Committee has set up inspection stations at Baiguan, Wutai Gate, Xiaxin River, and Qingshan. All committee members have set out to inspect the dikes and have set a period, with a water level of 40 feet being a critical period, 45 feet being a serious period, and 48 feet being a very serious period. The flood prevention funds have been presented by the Department of Construction to the provincial government for Jianghan Engineering Bureau to first allocate 40,000 yuan for standby use. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau has separately set up engineering offices in the counties along the Yangtze and Xiang rivers to pay special attention to rescue work. The required laborers are responsible for the conscription of the respective county magistrates. (6th)</p>
<h3>The Tongpu Railway's Taiyuan to Jiexiu Section Opens to Traffic; First Service Offers Simultaneous North-South Departures</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: The Taiyuan-Jiexiu section of the Tongpu Railway officially opened for business on the first of the month. Yesterday (the first) at dawn, more than two thousand people from all walks of life went outside Xiaodongmen to observe. At 7:30 AM, trains departed simultaneously from Taiyuan and Jiexiu stations. After switching tracks at Taiyuan Station, they arrived safely at both destinations around 7:00 PM. Passengers boarded and disembarked at each station along the way. A detailed account of the opening is as follows:</p>
<p>The train consisted of locomotive number 102, coupled with two passenger cars converted from boxcars, and one each of a gondola, flatcar, and mail car. The national flag of the Party and State was hung in a crisscross manner at the front of the locomotive, along with a red satin, green-edged triangular commemorative flag with the four characters "Construction Vanguard" presented by the Construction Promotion Association. At 7:30 AM, the train whistled and departed, stopping briefly at each station. The crowds were exceptionally dense, especially at the Yuci and Jiexiu stations. Upon reaching the Xiaohe Bridge, Jia Jingde and others disembarked one after another to inspect it. At Taigu, a northbound train also entered the station, consisting of locomotive number 103, coupled with one gondola and boxcar each, and one each of a flatcar and mail car, carrying many passengers and goods. The train stopped at the station for twenty minutes, and then the two trains departed north and south, respectively. The southbound train, in addition to arriving and departing at the stations along the way on time, also arrived in Jiexiu precisely at 7:30 PM last night. The audience at the station, men and women, numbered no less than several hundred.</p>
<p>The entire Tai-Jie section is paved with ballast, already covering several dozen kilometers. Eighty or ninety percent of the entire route has dense weeds growing on both sides. The interwoven roots of the grass are sufficient to solidify the roadbed, so even if there is rain this summer, it will not be affected in any way. Except for the bowstring girder of the Xiaohe Bridge, which has not yet been relocated, the other bridge projects on the Wuma River, Changyuan River, Dashi River, and Xiaoshi River are all largely completed. From five kilometers south of Xugou Station to Taigu, and south of Taigu to Dongguan, traffic is still using temporary roads. It is said that by the fifth of this month, the main road will be open. The two kilometers from the northern end of the Dashi River to Jiexiu are also accessed via a temporary road, but since the bridge construction has been completed, the date for moving to the main road should not be far off. The driving along the route is very smooth. However, a few minutes after leaving Qixian Station, it was reported that because of several sleepers with hollowed-out foundations, the speed was reduced, but the train passed smoothly. The new road is very slow, traveling at a little over thirteen kilometers per hour. Yesterday, the two stations sold over 289 yuan in tickets.</p>
<p>Jia Jingde talked about how the Tongpu Railway had already been designated at the end of the Qing Dynasty. The central government had borrowed 10 million yuan from the Belgian company, with the Zhengtai Railway responsible for repaying the principal and interest, paying 1.2 million yuan annually. The Shanxi Provincial Assembly rallied opposition, resulting in a stalemate. Later, Director Yan came forward and guaranteed the construction conditions, which solved the problem. However, in the fourth year of the Republic [1915], these funds were diverted by Yuan Shikai for imperial purposes. Later, Shanxi repeatedly requested the central government to raise funds for construction. In the seventeenth and eighteenth years of the Republic [1928-1929], I stayed in Beijing for six months, negotiating this matter. The central government only agreed to reclassify the third phase of the project as the second phase, but nothing came of it. However, Director Yan was determined to advance the construction. He hired two German engineers, Wang Nai and Möller, to survey the entire line. After Wang and others completed the survey, they suggested that building a light, narrow-gauge railway would be economically suitable. This time, Director Yan actively pursued this matter. After detailed planning, it was determined that building a standard-gauge railway would require 10 million yuan, while building a light-gauge railway would only require a little over 1 million yuan, making it the most economical to operate. Even decades later, to meet the needs of society, rebuilding it as a standard-gauge railway would still be very cost-effective, he said. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Archaeological Work Completed in Jiaodong; Many Pieces of Black Pottery Collected in Jimo and Rizhao</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Antiquities Research Association previously sent Qi Yanpei and Wang Xiang to Rizhao and Jimo to investigate antiquities. After several months, Qi and Wang have recently returned to Jinan one after another. According to their account of the investigation process and the items collected, "After we set off, we first arrived in Jimo, where we stayed for a total of nine days. In Chengzicun, west of the county seat, we discovered the remains of two ancient cities. The traces are still clearly visible. Later, we traveled by sea to the Xichengzhen area west of Rizhao City. There, several acres of land were filled with rubble. Stone knives, stone axes, tripod feet, and stone arrowheads were readily available. It can be determined that they are relics from the Stone Age, earlier than Anshang Village. The tripod feet have something resembling a human face on top and two holes. Locals call them 'ghost faces.' The story goes that in ancient times, there was an era when humans and ghosts were indistinguishable, and everyone wore a ghost face mask. When a guest visited a host, they had to take off the mask and put it behind them before being received, like today's name cards. In fact, they are tripod feet, hence the far-fetched rumors. After passing through Danshi Village, Liujialou, and Yaowangcheng, we returned to Xuejiadao along the coast, and then took the Jiaoji Railway from Jimo back to Jinan. A total of more than 5,000 pieces were obtained on this trip, all of which were black pottery, none of which were complete. However, some of the stone arrowheads were intact. Compared with the tripod feet previously obtained at the Longshan Chengzizhai site, their ages are similar, but the black pottery is from prehistory, making it the earliest of the antiquities collected in Shandong Province. They are currently being sorted and studied." (6th)</p>

<h3>The Songjiang County Chamber of Commerce Appeals for River Dredging</h3>
<p>To the Gentlemen of the Shanghai Songjiang Fellow Association: The following is a telegram to the Provincial Government's Department of Construction: "To Chen, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang, and Shen, Director of the Department of Construction: The Songjiang city river is silted up. Previous discussions on dredging the river were eagerly awaited by the citizens. However, work was suddenly halted after starting from the east gate, causing the area from the city center to Malu Bridge to be scorched by the scorching sun, exposing the riverbed and creating cracked earth. Drinking water is obtained from foul and rotten water. Commercial transportation is blocked due to the drying up of the river. Epidemics are spreading more and more rapidly. In the event of a fire, we can only sit and watch it spread. The lives and property of the Songjiang people are all sacrificed due to the cessation of river dredging. It has been found that the county government is responsible for presiding over the construction plan and the progress of the project. Although the suspension of dredging is due to the attacks of some people, the focus of the dispute is on the poor construction methods, not on the cessation of river dredging. Therefore, changing the approach is the right way. Abandoning food because of choking is not the solution. The county magistrate, in a fit of anger, allowed non-committee members present at the second river dredging committee meeting to conduct an illegal vote and hastily decided to suspend the project. Drinking water is related to hygiene, and transportation is related to commerce. What have the 80,000 citizens of Songjiang done to offend the county magistrate that he should bear to put all the citizens in a state of terror without considering it for even a moment? We have specially taken a film of the dried-up city river and appeal for your prompt attention. We urge you to order the county magistrate of Songjiang County to continue dredging as soon as possible to maintain water conservancy and emphasize hygiene. We are anxiously awaiting your orders." Songjiang County Chamber of Commerce, Yu Kou, etc. We respectfully request that you gentlemen unanimously advocate and do your best to help. We believe that you will grant our request, considering the concerns of our hometown. Sincerely wishing you all the best. Songjiang County Chamber of Commerce, July 7th.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Petition for Justice for Father's Wrongful Death</h3>
<p>A shocking and appalling murder case occurred in Muhangtou, Xin'er District, Haiment County, last month, unprecedented since the tragic case of a son killing his father to avenge himself that occurred in Nantong, causing a sensation in several counties. The deceased was Wu Guixiang, a cloth merchant from Chuangang Township, who was hacked seven times with an axe, and his heart was also dug out. Now, Wu Qihong, the eldest son of the deceased, claiming that Haiment County has been unable to solve the case, came to Suzhou yesterday, accompanied by Mr. Shen, Wu's uncle in Suzhou, to visit the High Court to petition. Since the matter fell within the scope of the procuratorate, they visited the Chief Prosecutor to petition. He promised to order the original county to solve the case within a limited time. Wu also intends to appeal to the fellow townsmen of Tongchonghai living in Suzhou and Shanghai, and to go to Zhenjiang to petition the provincial government. The original text of his petition is recorded below: "Petition for the wrongful death of my father, the authorities' failure to investigate effectively, the murderer at large, requesting an order to solve the case within a limited time to achieve justice. My father, Wu Guixiang, was 42 years old, and has been engaged in commerce in his hometown, abiding by the law and not having any grudges with anyone. Suddenly, on June 4th of this year, he was found hacked to death in the Song Jinxiang field in Muhangtou, Xin'er District, Haiment County, with his head and abdomen split, his body dismembered, and his brain, heart, and lungs all gone, leaving only a blood-soaked shell, a truly unbearable sight. Judging by the circumstances, it seemed that he was hacked to death with a large axe, with as many as seven cuts. People are spreading rumors that the murderer wanted to obtain a living heart and brain to make a secret recipe to treat a disease, and therefore committed this act. Such a shocking and appalling case is unprecedented. After reporting the case, the Haiment County government sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that he was hacked to death while alive. The county government agreed to solve the case within a week, stating that the circumstances of this case are not without clues. However, more than a month has passed, and there has been no news. It has never been heard that the authorities have sent personnel to investigate or ordered a limited time to solve the case. My father has a grandmother of ninety years old (i.e., my great-grandmother) and parents of nearly seventy years old above him, a wife and younger sister in the middle, and three sons and two daughters below him. I am the eldest, and the rest are young. Having suffered this great tragedy, they are all in so much pain that they wish they were dead. As a result, the elderly are either sick or insane, and the young are uneducated and uncared for. I have repeatedly petitioned the authorities to arrest the murderer and have been running around, spending a lot of money. Now, my father's injustice has not been redressed, and the family has gone bankrupt. I am truly overwhelmed with grief. I have no choice but to come to Suzhou to implore you to order Haiment County to solve the case and arrest the murderer within a limited time to redress the injustice and maintain the law."</p>
<h3>The County Government Discusses Drought Relief</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Wu Qiyun, considering that Wuxian County has not had rain for several months, the fields are cracked, and it is impossible to transplant rice seedlings, and a disaster is imminent, convened representatives from various agencies and local figures yesterday (the 6th) morning to discuss relief measures. County Magistrate Wu chaired the meeting, and the following resolutions were made on the spot: (1) Assuming that it does not rain again within ten days, transplanting rice seedlings using the replanting method will be implemented. If it still does not rain within twenty days, dry crops such as buckwheat and soybeans will be planted instead. (2) Notices will be sent to all district offices to instruct township chiefs to discuss water drawing methods with landowners and tenants. (3) A letter will be sent to the Land Industry Association to purchase water drawing machines and distribute them to various townships. (4) A letter will be sent to the Grain Storage Association to prepare for price stabilization. (5) A letter will be sent to the rice industry stating that hoarding and speculation will not be tolerated.</p>
<h3>Tragic News Amidst the Severe Drought in Wuxi</h3>
<p>The climate is extremely hot, and there is still no rain. The fields are cracked, making it difficult to transplant rice seedlings. The losses are very significant. It is common to hear of violent fights and械斗械斗 among farmers over water drawing issues. Yesterday, Huang Jinbao (52 years old), a villager from Xianghuaqiao Township, Xiatang, Luoshe Town, swallowed opium and committed suicide because his crops were about to wither and die, and Xu Chengkang and Ping A'da, the owners of a water drawing machine boat, deliberately made things difficult and refused to draw water for the hundreds of acres of land there. Upon hearing this, Huang was extremely anxious and suddenly had suicidal thoughts. Later, his wife, Mrs. Feng, hired a boat to come to the city and seek treatment at the Brothers Hospital. However, due to severe poisoning, he died. In addition, the Qishuyan Power Plant, due to the severe drought, is conducting electric irrigation. In Beixia Township, the tenth district, in order to help farmers, a Farmers' Loan Savings Office was established to implement water capital loans, stipulating a loan of one yuan per mu, which is to be repaid when the crops are harvested, and to guide farmers to automatically open rivers to facilitate the entry and exit of machine boats. In Hongshengli, Nanyan City, a drought demon was discovered climbing a tree, with its hands clasped together, bowing to the sun for about three minutes before suddenly disappearing. The villagers were greatly alarmed and said that this was a premonition of drought. Furthermore, small boats in the four townships have mostly stopped running due to the shallowness of the river, making transportation inconvenient. Only about half of the farmland has been transplanted. According to rice industry insiders, the existing rice in the county is still sufficient for the time being. If it does not rain for another month, people will be panic-stricken, and the price of rice may exceed 16 yuan per stone. Therefore, they hope that the authorities will prepare grain storage, control rice prices, and conduct price stabilization to help the poor. Also, in the Chenjiaqiao area of Donghutang, because the crops have all withered and died, some people are replanting soybeans and kidney beans, but they have not yet germinated due to lack of water.</p>
<h3>Changshu Farmers Request More Roads and Water Pipes</h3>
<p>The roadbed of the Xichang Highway has been built, and the bridges are currently being built by Yuqing Company. However, the farmland on both sides of the road will be obstructed for drainage and irrigation. The Department of Construction previously planned to install cement water pipes in each section, but due to economic constraints, it was stipulated that only two locations would be set up per kilometer. If there are not enough, each township should pay for its own additions. However, there is a lot of farmland on both sides of the highway, and the water pipes set up by the Department are not enough. They have asked the district office to submit a request to the county to add more. The county is now instructing each district to investigate the number of water pipes that should be added, totaling more than 140 locations. The county government will report the situation to the Department of Construction and request that it find a way to increase the budget to prioritize farmland.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Farmers Pray for Rain by Abstaining from Slaughtering Animals Due to Severe Drought</h3>
<p>Since the recent months, the heat has suddenly increased in the county, and the weather has been severely dry. There has been no rain. Plants in the fields, those that have emerged from the soil, are gradually withering, and those that have not been planted cannot be planted. Farmers in general are all worried. Therefore, all townships in the county have automatically stopped slaughtering animals since the fourth of this month to pray for rain.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Education Bonds Drawn Seven Times</h3>
<p>The seventh drawing of Jiangdu Education Bonds was held at 9:00 AM on the 6th in the county government auditorium. Wang, Secretary of the County Government, Xinlao, Director of the Education Bureau, Lang, Inspector of the Public Security Bureau, Zhou Yiren of the Property Office, Xiang Shucheng of the County Party Headquarters, Chang Shizhi of the Chamber of Commerce, and Yang Shengwu and Zhu Ganchen, salt merchants, were present. Secretary Wang and Chang Shizhi were publicly elected to draw the lots. As a result, the numbers ending in 2, 3, and 5 were drawn. Those who have won the lottery can go to the Education Bureau from the 16th to verify the bonds with a stamp and go to the Bank of Communications to withdraw the money.</p>
<h3>Collecting Special Funds to Purchase Grain for Famine Relief</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu County Government, considering that there is no hope for the autumn harvest in the northwest townships this year due to the drought and that a famine is imminent, and that the county's grain storage only began to establish a Food Management Committee last year, with warehouses set up in Shaobo and Yiling, purchasing grain for storage, has purchased only three thousand several hundred stone in total by the 22nd year, which is too small to prepare for famine relief. It has decided to rush to collect special funds for grain storage and purchase grain for storage in its entirety to prepare for disasters.</p>
<h3>A New Company Established on the Shanghai-Yangzhou Route</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai-Yangzhou shipping route by Datong and Dada companies, the business has been very prosperous. Currently, with wheat coming onto the market, the wheat transported from Huojiaqiao in the Huaibei area to Shanghai is counted in dozens of piculs per day. The merchant ships of both companies are always fully loaded on each trip. It is now heard that Yu Qiaqing and others in Shanghai have initiated the formation of Daxing Merchant Shipping Company to operate on the Shanghai-Yangzhou route. Tian Qirong has been assigned to prepare the branch offices in various towns. Once the company's organization is in place, it will be able to start operations.</p>
<h3>An Old Woman in Ningbo Gives Her Life to Pray for Rain Amidst Severe Drought</h3>
<p>Mrs. Chen of Chen Wenji Woodworks in Hengzhangqiao, Yinxi, is 63 years old this year and has seven children, all of whom are married. Recently, due to the long drought and the imminent failure of the autumn harvest, she bathed and changed her clothes, bid farewell to her ancestors, and went alone to Fengqiaokou (commonly known as Longtan) nearby yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, throwing herself into the water to give her life to pray for rain. By the time her family discovered her, she had already drowned. Such a senseless sacrifice is truly pitiful.</p>
<h3>Bridge Collapse in Haimen Injures Two</h3>
<p>The bridge in Juyang Town, the sixth district, has been in disrepair for years and is in poor condition. The other day, when many villagers were passing over it, the bridge surface suddenly collapsed with a loud noise, and eight people who could not escape fell into the river. Two of them, Shi Kaohu and Wang Zhiqing, were seriously injured by the bridge debris. They were rescued by people and are in critical condition, with concerns for their lives.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan Plague Rampant, Deaths Follow One Another</h3>
<p>Due to the severe drought and extreme heat in Xiaoshan city and countryside, the river water has dried up, causing problems with residents' drinking water. Recently, due to unclean drinking water, a plague has become rampant, and deaths have followed one another. From the 2nd to the 6th, there have been more than seventy deaths in the east and west markets. Doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine in Xiaoshan are extremely busy. Coffin shops have tripled their profits, and they are working day and night to increase production, yet they still cannot keep up with demand.</p>
<h3>Two Steam Launches Robbed at Qianshan Yang Lake, Huzhou</h3>
<p>The Jiahu Route of the Tongyuan Steam Launch Bureau of this city, was en route from Jiaxing to Huzhou the day before yesterday. At approximately 11:00 PM, when passing the river surface at the south entrance of Qianshan Yang Lake, a bandit boat suddenly appeared with nine bandits aboard. The bandits fired shots as a warning, forcing the launch to stop. The bandits boarded and searched, robbing passengers of silver dollars, jewelry, clothing, and other items, amounting to a loss of over four hundred yuan. The driver of the launch, Zhang Liansheng, was shot in the face by the bandits. Two passengers were also slightly injured. The bandits also damaged two oil pipes of the launch, rendering it unable to operate. It was anchored overnight at Qianshan Yang Lake. At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the Xin Changhang Launch of the Changhang Bureau passed by and towed it to Huzhou. Later, the Tongan Launch, also from the Shuang Kaihu Route, was also robbed at Qianshan Yang Lake. Fortunately, the launch had no passengers, so no losses were incurred.</p>

They arrived in Shanghai on the Italian Steamer "Ganqui" at 11:30 AM yesterday morning. President Wang's representative Chu Minyi and Mayor Wu, all went to the port to welcome them. Gu will rest in Shanghai for two or three days before going to Nanjing to meet with authorities and report. He plans to stay in China for three or four months before returning to his post. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Arrival at Port</h3>
<p>Gu Weijun, the Chinese Envoy to France, Hu Shih-tse, the Chinese Envoy to Switzerland, Judge Wang Chonghui of the Hague International Court of Justice, Wu Lien-teh, Director of the National Seaport Quarantine Service, Shi Zhaokui, Secretary of the Chinese Embassy in France, and Wei Daoming, former Minister of the Judicial Administration Department, all returned to China on the Italian Steamer "Ganqui" this time.

<h3>Welcoming Personnel</h3>
<p>Those who went to the port to welcome them yesterday morning included Chu Minyi, representative of the President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei; Yan Deqing, representative of the Chinese Envoy to Russia; Zhao Tiezhang, representative of the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Lin Shi, the newly appointed Consul General in Paris; Chen Shiguang, former Director of the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Huang Naishu, Director of the Postal Department of the Ministry of Communications; Gu Weijun's older brother, Weixin; and dozens of relatives and friends of Gu and Hu, who took the "Yuebao", "Jingguang", and "Jinghui" launches to cross the river and board the steamer to welcome them. Mayor Wu Tiecheng was unable to cross the river to welcome them due to attending the 7th Anniversary Celebration of the establishment of the Municipal Government. In addition to sending secretaries Tang Shixuan and Zhang Tingrong to board the steamer, Mayor Wu himself also rushed to the New Customs Wharf to greet them. After Gu disembarked, he took a car with Mayor Wu back to his private residence on Maigen Road to rest.</p>
<h3>Gu's Remarks</h3>
<p>Gu made the following remarks to reporters from various newspapers on the steamer, roughly saying that this time he returned to China to take care of private matters. Since he went abroad with the investigation team, he has been away for more than two years. When he went to take up his post, he was in a hurry and many private matters had not been taken care of. Now, he plans to take advantage of the relatively free time during the summer vacation to return to China. He plans to stay in China for three or four months before returning to his post.</p>
<h3>Foreign Countries' Attitudes Towards China</h3>
<p>He then said that people in European countries have a strong hope for China, considering China as the key to peace in the Far East and hoping that China can unify and strengthen. If China can strengthen itself, the Far East issue will be easily resolved. Authorities of various countries and those who know the situation in China well, also believe that China is now on the track of unification, expressing considerable relief and hoping that China can become more sound to avoid being disturbed by external forces.</p>
<h3>Resolution Not to Recognize Manchukuo</h3>
<p>All countries are now clear about Japan's policies and measures after the September 18th Incident. As for the puppet state of Manchukuo, since the League of Nations unanimously passed the principle of not recognizing it based on the Lytton Report, all countries still adhere to this principle to the end and always abide by it.</p>
<h3>Situation in Europe</h3>
<p>Gu then said that regarding the situation in Europe, various countries are currently dealing with many internal affairs. The disarmament conference has failed. Countries have not only not reduced their armaments, but are expanding them day by day. Although there are no major dangers at present, it is difficult to maintain lasting peace.</p>
<h3>Russia and Germany Joining the League</h3>
<p>As for the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations, the matter has been brewing for a long time. Before he left Europe, it had been largely agreed upon. It is widely hoped that the Soviet Union will be able to join at the League of Nations General Assembly on September 10 this year. As for Germany rejoining the League of Nations, it is difficult to achieve for the time being, but all countries hope that it will restore its membership status so that European issues can be resolved more easily.</p>
<h3>Report to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Gu continued to say that he has been traveling in Europe for many years and is not very clear about the situation in the Far East and at home, so he is returning to China to take the opportunity to investigate. After arriving in Shanghai, he plans to rest for a while and then go to Nanjing in about two or three days to meet with President Wang and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report everything. If Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has left Nanjing at that time, he will go to Jiangxi to meet with him. In addition, Gu expressed his views on the issue of postal communication, saying that the League of Nations has resolved three principles regarding postal communication, but they are based on the positions of various countries themselves. Whether they are beneficial or harmful to China needs to be carefully considered.</p>
<h3>Hu's Remarks</h3>
<p>According to Hu Shih-tse, the Chinese Envoy to Switzerland who came with Gu, his father passed away last November. He originally planned to return to China from Europe soon, but he was unable to do so due to busy official duties, so he gave up. This time, he took advantage of the summer vacation to request leave to return to China to take care of his father's funeral. His father is scheduled to be memorialized in Beijing on the 10th of this month. He plans to stay in Shanghai overnight and leave for the north the next day (that is, today) to handle the funeral. He plans to rest in China for two months and return to Europe in early September to attend the League of Nations conference.</p>
<h3>China General Chamber of Industry Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday, Resolved to Telegraph the Government to Revise the New Tariff, Publicly Elected Guo Shun and Others as Representatives to Petition in Nanjing, Sent a Letter to Both Banking Industries to Take Unified Action</h3>
<p>The China General Chamber of Industry believes that the new import tariff announced by the Ministry of Finance this time is not in line with the principle of protecting tariffs in many aspects, and the domestic industry and commerce will suffer significant damage. In order to remedy this situation, an emergency meeting of all members was held at the meeting hall on Hankou Road at 5:00 PM yesterday. It was resolved to telegraph the government to re-revise the new tariff, publicly elect Guo Shun, Hu Xiyuan, Ji Jiannan, and six others to petition in Nanjing, and send a letter to the financial community to take unified action. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Emergency Meeting) Those present yesterday included Guo Shun, Chairman of the China General Chamber of Industry, and industrial and commercial leaders Ji Jiannan, Hu Xiyuan, Zhang Zemin, Ying Yongxi, Mo Jingyong, Deng Gengxin, Wang Yunwu (Huang Zhongming representing), Liu Yuanshi, Xu Jingyi, Hong Weiguan, Wu Yunchu (Hu Xiyuan representing), Wang Yaochen, and Zhang Shoupeng of the Wuxian Branch of the Industrial Federation, and more than twenty other people, chaired by Chairman Guo Shun and recorded by Wu Shuchen.</p>
<p>(Chairman's Report) After the formal proceedings, Chairman Guo Shun reported, roughly saying, "Gentlemen, you all know why this association is holding an emergency meeting today. There is no need for me to go into details. This time, the government will revise the import tariff, either increasing or decreasing it. We didn't know anything about it beforehand. However, we got some news from Japanese newspapers. At that time, Mr. Yu Qiaqing and our cotton mill association immediately telegraphed the government, explaining the pros and cons in detail and asking the government to pay special attention. The decline of our country's industry and commerce is based on the original tariff to collect import tariffs, which still cannot limit the quantitative import of foreign goods and encroach on our country's market. Therefore, our country's industrial and commercial circles hope that the government will find ways to remedy it. I believe that this new tariff is a fatal blow to our country's industrial and commercial circles. Please discuss it at length and try to save it."</p>
<p>(Resolutions) (1) A proposal to telegraph the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and Ministry of Finance, requesting a revision of the new tariff to maintain industry and commerce was resolved to be passed. (2) Hu Xiyuan proposed that the Ministry of Finance's revision of the new tariff was announced and implemented on the 2nd of this month. It is found that this new tariff rate is of great concern to the vital interests of the national industry and commerce. It is proposed to send representatives to Nanjing to petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry. The proposal was resolved to elect Guo Shun, Hu Xiyuan, Ji Jiannan, Wang Yaochen, Liu Baijing, and Li Bosen as representatives to go to Nanjing to petition when Minister Kong returns to Nanjing. (3) Hong Weiguan proposed that when the representatives of this association go to Nanjing to petition, they should also request the Ministry of Finance to return the raw material tax. The resolution was passed. (4) Zhang Shoupeng of the Wuxian Branch proposed to unite the financial community to jointly fight for the government's case. It was resolved that the association should first send a letter to the banking guilds, explaining the pros and cons of not revising the new tariff, not taking a bystander attitude, and jointly discussing remedial measures. (5) The Wuxian Branch proposed that the new tariff implemented by the Ministry of Finance increased the weight of machinery, cotton, paper, and rayon, putting the domestic industry in a desperate situation. It should be requested to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry to promptly correct or temporarily suspend the implementation of the four industrial tariffs in order to maintain the industry. The resolution was approved for submission. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>(Telegraph to the Government) President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, Greetings. In recent times, all countries have built high tariff barriers to protect their own industries and restrict the import of foreign goods. Our country's industry is in danger and on the verge of collapse. We are looking forward to the government finding ways to provide relief and extend a glimmer of hope. Now, we would like to list the most harmful and impossible tariffs in the tariff rules as follows: (1) The most imported goods are cotton and foreign paper. Our country's textile and papermaking industries are very young. Due to the impact of Japanese goods dumping, they are always losing money. Now, the import tariff has been greatly reduced, which is a direct reward for the import of foreign goods. (2) Various machines required by factories across the country have to rely on foreigners because there are no suitable substitutes in the country. If the government wants to develop the industry, it should reduce this tariff to facilitate the purchase of various factories and reduce the indirect burden. (3) Foreign cotton and various pigments are necessary materials for our country's textile, dyeing and other industries. Now, the tax on foreign cotton has been increased to 42%, and the tax on various pigments has been increased to 20%, which is somewhat self-contradictory. To sum up the above, this revision of the import tariff, one decrease and one increase, is enough to reward the dumping of foreign goods and destroy the lifeblood of the industry, favoring others and harming ourselves, and leaving endless troubles. The members of the association are deeply concerned about the difficulties and cannot bear to see the only industry and millions of workers who rely on it for a living in our country fall into a desperate situation and perish together. Therefore, we telegraphed to your honorable courts (ministries) to show concern for the people's suffering and re-revise it to maintain the industry. China General Chamber of Industry.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Urge the Government to Abolish the New Tariff, Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association</h3>
<p>Sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "Dear Sir, the new customs tariff announced by the government on July 1, weighing the principles of fiscal tariff or protective tariff, your association has captured the main points and severely criticized it in the past, and various industries have cried out in distress afterwards because their vital interests are at stake. All those related to the backward industry of our country will lose the protection of the tax wall, and they will also reveal everything. Members speak about their industry and dare to contribute their survival to tell the leading businessmen of our association. I checked the tariffs announced this time, and those belonging to cotton products are reduced without increase compared with the old rate. The largest proportion is reduced to 50%. The content is roughly the same. The reduction of crude goods and those with considerable domestic production is still slight, such as plain cotton cloth, etc. The refined products produced in China are not many, and those with a large amount of domestic production but few imports of foreign goods have been greatly reduced. The former is like printed and dyed goods, and the latter is like dyed yarn woven cloth mercerized yarn. We remember the process of revising the tariffs this time. What the government declared to the people of the country was nothing more than preventing tax evasion. We sympathize with the hard work of the ruling officials. However, in view of the rise and fall of our country's industry, whether tariffs can fulfill the responsibility of protection, what we think is dangerous is difficult to keep silent. Our country's production is backward, not because of the inferiority of wisdom, but because it has been trapped in the shackles of tariffs that cannot be independent. After the Sino-Japanese tariff reciprocity agreement expired last year, the tariffs on cotton products increased considerably, and the national tax revenue increased as a result. Japanese cotton cloth has been greatly hit, and there are figures to prove it. Even the domestic dyeing and weaving industry can maintain its original position in the midst of wind and rain, with slight progress. It is known that protective tariffs are the only way to maintain domestic industry, and it is further known that the national products such as plain cotton cloth, dyed yarn woven cloth mercerized yarn, etc., can seize the position of foreign goods, and the very few production of printed and dyed cloth refined products depends on whether the protection of tariffs can be transferred. If the tariff wall policy is determined and promoted, those who have already gained a position can become more stable, and those who have very little production can also increase production and compete with foreign goods. Even if they cannot soar on the world commercial stage, they can become a situation of self-defense and self-sufficiency. Now, if they do not increase but decrease, those who have already gained a position will inevitably be driven to fragmentation and decline, and those who have not yet produced will have no day to sprout. As for using tax cuts as a means to prevent tax evasion, even if they can get their wish, it is still a small loss. Whether it can be stopped is unknown. Members are deeply aware of the pain of national subjugation and industry collapse, and dare to make urgent statements. We beg you to forward this to the government and withdraw the order.</p>
<p>The silk satin printing industry guild sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry yesterday regarding the Ministry of Finance's promulgation of the revised new import tariff, saying, "President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, Greetings. It is found that increasing import tariffs is a unified tariff care policy implemented by all countries in the world. Although our country's current tariff rate is still far from the meaning of tariff protection, it gives a blow to the import of foreign goods. Therefore, the domestic industry has a glimmer of hope, which is of great benefit to the country's economy and people's livelihood. However, suddenly, the Ministry of Finance suddenly promulgated and implemented the revised new import tariff on July 1. It reduces the tariffs on those that should be increased, and increases the tariffs on those that should be reduced. According to the Ministry of Finance, it can reduce leakage and increase tax revenue, but is the pros and cons really so simple? Taking the printed silk satin industry as an example, it has always been a major item of Japanese goods dumping. Through the efforts of the Chinese people in recent years, it has achieved considerable success. Now, once the import tax is reduced, it will give Japanese goods a chance to take advantage of, and they will inevitably dump a large amount of goods, seize the market, and the national printed silk satin will have no place to stand. Looking forward to the future, we cannot help but shudder. It should be requested to focus on the country's economy and people's livelihood and promptly cancel and stop the implementation of the revised new tariff, and also ask for overall planning, increase import tariffs, and implement a tariff protection policy, so that the future of the industry will be hopeful, and it will also be the blessing of the nation and the party.</p>
<p>The National Goods Factory Association held a meeting yesterday to discuss the new import tariff. They all believed that the new tariff issued this time is more harmful than beneficial to the national goods factories compared with the old tariff set in May last year. Taking the textile industry as an example, after the tariff rate increased last year, the import of foreign yarn and foreign cloth decreased slightly, but the factories set up by foreign businessmen in China still competed hard, causing the textile industry to be in a state of shock. This time, the new tariff reduces the import tax rate on foreign yarn and foreign cloth, which is tantamount to helping them dump. In addition, machinery is necessary for improving industry. Our country's industry is young and needs a lot of machinery. This time, the import tax on machinery has been increased, which is indirectly preventing the construction of domestic industry. It was resolved to telegraph the Executive Yuan, severely criticizing the pros and cons, and asking for the withdrawal of the previous proposal.</p>
<p>The Cotton Industry Association held its 28th executive committee meeting yesterday. It was resolved to submit a petition to the Legislative Yuan to quickly announce the Regulations on the Prohibition of Cotton, and to submit a petition to the Ministry of Finance to separately preserve and abolish the new import tariff. The original text is as follows: (1) Legislative Yuan, Greetings. According to reports, your honorable court has passed the Regulations on the Prohibition of Cotton, which shows the ultimate intention to eliminate evil and improve national cotton. However, it is found that the long-standing abuses of Chinese cotton are deeply ingrained. If there is no clear indication, it may be difficult to make everyone aware of it. It is not easy to discover and abide by the reward for reporting. The members of the association are engaged in the cotton industry and are familiar with the situation. Therefore, we specifically request that a reward for reporting be added to the regulations, so that people are willing to report, and those who commit fraud will know where to be wary. We also ask for prompt implementation, and before the new cotton is launched, we will issue a notice to all producing areas to make it known to all in order to eliminate abuses and protect national products. (2) Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance, Greetings. On the 2nd of this month, we were given the full text of the new customs import tariff. The increase in the import tax on foreign cotton is enough to prevent dumping and support national products. But it is found that foreign yarn and foreign cloth have been reduced by 30% to 40%, which is not the intention of protecting industry. Our country's textile industry is still young. We already feel difficult to import foreign goods. We have heard about the reduction of work and suspension of work from time to time. If we give it a chance to reduce taxes again, it will be tantamount to inviting its dumping. The future of textiles is in danger. Please abolish the reduction of various taxes in order to protect the industry and maintain the national economy. It has been sent by express mail and telegraph.</p>
<h3>7th Anniversary of the Establishment of the Municipal Government, Mayor and Directors of Various Bureaus Attend the Anniversary Ceremony, Wu Reports on Efforts to Build a Greater Shanghai Plan</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of this Municipal Government on July 7, 1927, it has been seven years in the blink of an eye. Through the careful management of successive mayors, it has gradually sought to realize the Greater Shanghai Plan. Since the completion of the new building in the city center on New Year's Day this year and its relocation to the office, other important buildings will also be realized in order. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Municipal Government specially convened officials from various departments and bureaus to hold the 7th Anniversary Celebration of the establishment of the Municipal Government in the auditorium. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Personnel: Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Director of the Public Security Bureau Wen Hongen, Director of the Land Bureau Jin Liren, Director of the Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>, Director of the Health Bureau Li Tingan, Secretaries Zhang Tingrong, Geng Jiaji, Guo Shihui, Section Chiefs Li Dachao, Wu Huanru, and more than 300 people from the entire staff security team and police brigade.</p>
<p>Ceremony Sequence: (1) Everyone stands at attention, (2) Play music, (3) Sing the Party song, (4) The chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will, (5) Silence, (6) The chairman reports, (7) Play music, (8) The ceremony ends, the meeting adjourns.</p>
<p>Mayor's Report: After the formal proceedings, Chairman and Mayor Wu Tiecheng reported, the original text is as follows, "Comrades, today is the 7th anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Since the establishment of the Municipal Government in the Republic of China, under the guidance of the government, the support of the local people, and the planning of successive mayors, and the efforts of all colleagues, we have achieved today's foundation. Today's foundation, we feel 12 points precious, in the future we should How to maintain this foundation, and make this foundation more and more consolidated and developed, this requires the continued efforts and dedication of all colleagues in the future. Shanghai is China's economic center. Since the national government established its capital in Nanjing, it is also the gateway to the capital. The construction of Greater Shanghai should live up to its name. The prosperity of Shanghai depends on the stability of the rural areas in the interior. The stability of the interior is the most important condition for the prosperity of Shanghai. In the past, due to the harassment of the Communist bandits in the interior, the rich came to Shanghai to take refuge, and those who had no money also came to Shanghai to make a living. The population of Shanghai has therefore increased a lot. The prosperity of Shanghai has been greatly affected by the increase in population. Now the work of suppressing bandits is progressing day by day. It is expected that the bandits can be eliminated this year. After the red bandits are eliminated, an even more important part of the work than suppressing bandits is the rehabilitation of the bandit areas and the revitalization of the rural areas. If we want to prosper Shanghai, we must arouse the interest of the people of Shanghai in the construction of Greater Shanghai. Secondly, we must also arouse the attention of the citizens to the revitalization of the rural economy, which is directly related to the prosperity of Shanghai. Now the interior is becoming more and more stable. Those who came to Shanghai to take refuge and make a living in the past will naturally return to their hometowns to seek the construction of their hometowns. If the people of Shanghai can directly participate in the revitalization of the rural economy, it is indirectly promoting the prosperity of Shanghai. In the past few years, Shanghai has become an oversupplied market and the economic situation is very slow due to the non-circulation of goods with the interior. Therefore, while we want to build a Greater Shanghai, we must also take into account the issue of rural revitalization in the interior. How should our Municipal Government and all colleagues arouse the interest of the people of Shanghai in participating in the construction of Greater Shanghai, so that Shanghai can truly become a representative city of China, and how to arouse the people of Shanghai to pay attention to the revitalization of the rural areas in the interior, and to invest in direct participation in the revitalization of the rural areas is indirectly promoting the prosperity of Shanghai. This is also the direction that all colleagues should work together in the future."</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Companies Held a Meeting Yesterday to Establish a Shipping Cooperation Agreement; A Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Federation Was Formed to Handle Cooperation; British Companies Taikoo and Jardine Matheson Joined with Separate Contracts</h3>
<p>The various shipping companies on the Shanghai-Tianjin line, after piloting shipping cooperation for two weeks starting from the 18th of last month and achieving effective results, held a meeting yesterday to continue the process, establish an agreement, and form a federation. British companies Taikoo and Jardine Matheson joined, each signing separate contracts with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Establishing an Agreement) After the successful trial of Shanghai-Tianjin shipping cooperation, the shipping companies decided to continue the process and held a meeting yesterday at 10 AM at the Shipping Club at 93 Guangdong Road. Representatives from the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, privately-owned Zhengji, Sanbei, Zhaoxing, etc., including Wu Delin, Wang Bofen, Yu Shunmao, etc., discussed and revised the drafted Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Agreement and its attachments in detail. It was decided to formally sign the agreement at a scheduled meeting after the secretary compiles the revised official documents and attachments.</p>
<p>(Forming a Federation) The candidates for the Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Federation committee were selected by each shipping company appointing one person. It has now been established, including 20 companies such as the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, privately-owned Sanbei, Zhengji, Haichang, Yu Da, Beifang, Zhaoxing, Zhidong, Tianjin, Hefeng, Hua Ning, Fu Ning, Zhong Tai, Huitong, Datongxing, Yuanxing, Shou Kang, Antai, Shunan, etc. The committee consists of 20 people, including Wang Bofen, Yu Shunmao, etc. The address is inside the Shanghai Shipping Trade Association at 93 Guangdong Road.</p>
<p>(British Companies Joining) During the trial period of Shanghai-Tianjin shipping cooperation, British companies Taikoo Steam Navigation Company and Jardine Matheson Steam Navigation Company were requested to join. Now, an agreement has been reached. The method is for the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to sign a Shanghai-Tianjin shipping cooperation agreement with British companies Taikoo and Jardine Matheson, stipulating freight rates and commissions, and not joining the Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Federation. However, the stipulated freight rates are consistent with the Federation, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is responsible for handling the matter.</p>
<p>(Stipulating Freight Rates) Shanghai-Tianjin shipping cooperation specifies freight rates for two categories: rice and flour. The stipulated freight rates are as follows: (Rice) Taikoo and Jardine Matheson: 4.4 jiao, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: 4.2 jiao, Chinese companies: 4 jiao. (Flour) Taikoo and Jardine Matheson: 2.1 jiao, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: 2 jiao, Chinese companies: 1.9 jiao. However, a recent amendment has been proposed: flour freight rates: Taikoo and Jardine Matheson: 2 jiao, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: 1.9 jiao, Chinese companies: 1.8 jiao, which is generally expected to be resolved without problems.</p>
<h3>Lou Tongsun Arrives in Shanghai, Says Changting Can Be Recovered Within a Month</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, Mr. Lou Tongsun, Secretary-General of the East Route Headquarters of the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Fujian-Zhejiang-Hubei Bandit Suppression Army, returned north from the Fujian border on official business at the end of last month. After arriving in Shanghai, he went to Hangzhou for official business. Yesterday, he came to Shanghai from Hangzhou. A reporter from Xin Sheng She visited him at Wan Ci and inquired about the latest situation of bandit suppression. His remarks are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(Bandit Areas Shrinking, Only Nine Counties Remaining) Mr. Lou briefly stated that since Chairman Chiang established the Officer Training Corps in Lushan last year, implementing the fifth encirclement and suppression campaign, with steady and solid progress, the trend has shifted, and the suppression is indeed likely to succeed. Looking at the past year or so, the national troops on all fronts have advanced without retreating, winning without defeat. As of now, the area occupied by bandits on the Fujian-Jiangxi border has shrunk to only nine counties: Guihua, Qingliu, Ninghua, Changting (belonging to Fujian), Shicheng, Ruijin, Xingguo, Yudu, and Huichang (belonging to Jiangxi). Moreover, they are surrounded by four armies, truly like fish in a pot, unable to escape the net. However, outsiders who do not understand the truth are misled by rumors and still harbor doubts about the military situation of bandit suppression, which is completely wrong. This is something that the news media should pay special attention to.</p>
<p>(Changting Can Be Recovered in One Month) Taking the East Route Army as an example, since Tai Ning and Jian Ning in northern Fujian, and Yong'an and Liancheng in western Fujian, have been successively recovered, the bandits in Guihua and Qingliu are now surrounded by 300 units of the East Route Army. Currently, the vanguard of the national troops is only a few dozen miles away from Ting, and it is expected that Changting will be recovered after last month.</p>
<p>(Strict Blockade, Bandits Are Extremely Panicked) The bandit army is under constant pressure from our troops' advance, with a strict blockade. They have long been exhausted and panicked. Recently, the bandit leader Shi De personally stationed himself in Changting to supervise the construction of fortifications and forcibly conscripted men to replenish casualties, which indicates the dire situation. Salt in the bandit area is sold for only two or three liang per yuan, and bandit soldiers are only issued half a jin of rice per day. The source of ammunition has also been cut off, and their plight is imaginable. Therefore, the bandit army's strategy focuses on "guerilla warfare" and "breakthrough" to fight a desperate battle. However, we are strictly guarding and responding to the situation with a calm approach, and the bandits will hardly escape.</p>
<p>(Southern Fujian Society Gradually Returns to Prosperity) Commander-in-Chief Chiang is also extremely concerned about the security of southern Fujian, distinguishing between suppression and pacification. Recently, it has become very peaceful, and the social situation is gradually returning to prosperity. It is reported that Mr. Lou will go to Nanjing soon and then to Jiangxi to report on the situation.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the County Public Funds and Property Office; Huang Yunzhen as Director, Peng Zhaotang as Deputy Director</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Public Funds and Property Management Office has received instructions from the provincial authorities to reorganize immediately and implement it at the beginning of the year. After receiving the order, the county government, in addition to instructing the office to comply, reappointed Huang Yunzhen as director (reappointed) and Peng Zhaotang as deputy director (former head of the second district of the county). Qin Xiqi, Shi She, Tang Fuqian, Sun Shiben, and other four people were appointed as accountants.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits a Petition to the Ministry of Finance to Abolish Wheel and Trailer Freight Tax</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "Regarding the petition, the association held its fifth member meeting on June 17. According to the proposal of the Inland River Steamboat Industry Association, please refer to the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 3066 and close the case (omitted) to abolish the wheel and trailer freight tax. On June 18, the association recorded the case and submitted it separately to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Transportation, requesting them to issue an order for cancellation. On the 6th of this month, we received Instruction No. 2295 from the Ministry of Transportation, which stated, 'Received. This case has been submitted to the Executive Yuan, ordering the Shanghai Municipal Government to handle the city's ship tax in accordance with Items 1 and 2 of the resolution on the Hebei Province ship tax collection, which was jointly reviewed by the Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Interior last year. Please inform the association and directly submit it to the Ministry of Finance for review.' The resolution and other information were distributed to the meeting. After reviewing Item 1 of the second item of the Hebei Province ship tax resolution attached by the Ministry of Transportation, ships with ship nationality certificates issued by the Ministry of Transportation will be exempted from ship tax by the provincial government. This is in line with the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 3066 issued in June last year, which states that local authorities should not levy fees on ships that have been legally registered and certified by the Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation. The matters are uniform. However, the Hebei Province ship tax resolution states that it can only be implemented after being reviewed by the Ministry of Finance and approved by the Executive Yuan. Therefore, the Ministry of Transportation believes that this matter is under your department's jurisdiction and instructed us to submit it directly for handling. We hereby submit the previous case in its entirety, requesting your ministry to take charge of the review and approval and issue an order for cancellation in accordance with the law, which would be in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Finance."</p>
<h3>Silverware Industry Labor Dispute Resolved by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions; Both Parties Negotiated a Settlement</h3>
<p>According to Da Gong She, all workers at the Sun Wanlong silverware workshop outside Xiaoximen went on strike the day before yesterday in response to the employer's reduction of wages. The Silverware Industry Union submitted a request to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for assistance. After receiving the request, the federation sent personnel to investigate the truth and convened both parties for mediation at 10 AM yesterday. Wu Bingquan from the labor side, Sun Binglong from the capital side, and Yuan Xingzhi from the trade association attended, with Fang Sheng, a cadre of the Federation of Trade Unions, presiding. After soliciting opinions from both parties, the labor side proposed the following: (1) All items already stipulated in the wage book should be calculated according to the wage book and should not be reduced. (2) New patterns, such as modern photo frames, should be jointly studied and decided by the trade association and the labor union. (3) Conditions for resuming work: (A) After the dispute is resolved, workers should not be dismissed on any pretext. (B) For all silver piece blanks, three cents per piece, or workers can do it themselves. (C) Wage deductions should not occur again in the future. Both parties agreed to the above conditions. Regarding (1) the wage issue during the strike period and (2) each worker being paid 20 yuan upon resumption of work, the capital side expressed disagreement. The trade association will convene a general meeting today to discuss and respond.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Factory Workers Reopen Meeting; Representatives Sent to Petition in Nanjing Again</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the strike at the Pudong British-American Tobacco Company is nearing its second month, and the labor and capital sides are at a stalemate. The labor side believes that the prolonged delay is causing hardship for the workers' livelihoods and has sent a letter to various circles for assistance to the British-American Tobacco Factory Workers Aid Committee, requesting a swift rescue plan. The committee is currently discussing rescue measures. The labor side reopened the 13th strike committee meeting yesterday, with all members attending. Chen Peide was elected as chairman. Resolutions: (1) Xiao Gengsheng will be sent to Nanjing again to petition. (2) Letters will be sent to the Da Mei and Hua Mei tobacco companies advising them not to produce products for the British-American Company until the strike is resolved, to avoid causing other complications.</p>
<h3>Provincial Capital National Exhibition Decided to Open as Scheduled; Liu Zhongying and Others Returned to Shanghai from Zhenjiang Yesterday; Manufacturers Association Specifies Participation Methods</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association undertook the Zhenjiang Provincial Capital National Products Movement Exhibition, all matters have gradually been prepared, and the opening ceremony has been set for the 20th of this month. The association previously sent standing committee members Liu Zhongying and other representatives to Zhenjiang to discuss the progress. They returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to a reporter from Yu Xin Xin She, the association's venue is located on Jiangbian Avenue in Zhenjiang, covering an area of more than eight mu. The venue is quite spacious, with a total of 150 houses built. The surrounding areas and walkways are very wide. All the engineering is expected to be completed within three to four days. It is learned that the association has specifically formulated methods and notified the manufacturers yesterday, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Notice to Manufacturers</h3>
<p>Regarding the notice, the Jiangsu Provincial Capital National Products Exhibition is co-sponsored by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, Provincial Government, and Construction Department, together with this association. Therefore, the local people in the provincial capital attach great importance to it. It is heard that the entire Shanghai manufacturer group will prepare a warm welcome on their arrival in Zhenjiang. Now it is confirmed that the official opening will be on the 20th of this month. In order to arrange in an orderly manner to avoid confusion and to make a grand spectacle, the association specifically stipulates the following methods:</p>
<p>(Stipulated Methods) (1) The products of participating manufacturers shall be shipped on the Shanghai-Nanjing train on the 13th and 14th. (2) The goods shall be sent directly from each factory to the North Railway Station. (3) Freight charges will be reduced by half according to grade, and paid directly to the railway business office by each factory. (4) Each piece of goods shall be affixed with the association's seal (seals can be collected from the association today).

If any participating manufacturer is found to be passing off enemy goods and foreign goods by rebranding them, in addition to confiscating the goods, a fine of up to 1,000 yuan will be imposed. Correspondingly, notice is hereby given.</p>
<h3>Tenants of Dalu Fang on Rue Lutetia Demand Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>The Rent Reduction Committee of Dalu Fang on Rue Lutetia sent a letter to the landlord yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>"Dear Sir/Madam, The tenants, for the sake of the common welfare of both parties, have sent a letter to the landlord, requesting a 30% rent reduction, but have not received a reply, which is very surprising. The previous letter was brief and did not fully express our intentions. Now, please allow us to elaborate further. Since the January 28th Incident, all industries in the city have declined, and the difficulty of life is twice as great as before. Everyone is doing their best to tighten their belts in terms of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, in order to achieve a balance between income and expenditure. Among the four, food, clothing, and transportation are sought by oneself and have been greatly reduced. Only the housing aspect must be discussed with the landlord. If the landlord says that the housing contract is there, you can stay if you agree, and you can move if you disagree, and the rent cannot be reduced, then what else is there to say? However, human beings have compassion and are ultimately different from animals. There is no one who would rather leave his thousands of mansions empty than prevent his fellow human beings from finding even a single rafter, suffering the burning sun, the rain, and the extreme heat and cold, with no place to hide, causing disease and epidemics to spread. The general people have meat to eat, cars to ride, and spend all day asking about houses and fields for profit. This human compassion may have been extinguished, and they consider themselves to be on par with animals. However, you are a believer of God and know the way of human love deeply, so we dare to ask you to consider human compassion and reduce the rent, firstly. In recent years, the market has been sluggish, and we are struggling under these circumstances, reducing everything. Only rent remains the largest monthly expense, which is not only beyond our ability but also unacceptable. Moreover, in terms of the price index, everything has decreased with the decline of the market. How can only rent remain unchanged? Therefore, please pay attention to the rise and fall of rent with other businesses and reduce the rent to match the current market situation, secondly. Moreover, rent reduction is not only beneficial to the tenants but also beneficial to the landlord. If the rent is too high, the tenants will inevitably move, from large houses to small houses, from living alone to subletting, causing the number of empty houses to increase day by day, with no one to take care of them. Landlords who want to make a lot of profit find that the houses are empty for a long time, so not only is there no profit to be made, but repairs and management also cost money everywhere. Why not reduce the rent to benefit both parties? Please consider the interests of all parties and reduce the rent, thirdly. Based on the above three points, we propose the following three methods: (1) Divide the rent of this fang into four types: 33 yuan, 35 yuan, 45 yuan, and 66 yuan (including water and street sweeping fees). (2) Collect rent at 70% of the above four rental prices. (3) Implement from July. We hope that all of the above three methods will be adopted. In addition, there are several things that cannot be left unsaid, please pay attention to them: (1) Add electric lights in the alley and extend the lighting time. (2) There must be police officers guarding the alley at night. (3) Set up toilets for urination and defecation. (4) Add lids to the garbage cans. (5) Clean frequently. (6) Prohibit vendors from entering the alley to hawk. We hope that we can work together in times of trouble and share our feelings as tenants and landlords to avoid a lose-lose situation. The tenants would be very grateful. We hereby make our request, hoping for a reply within a few days. We wish you all the best, The Rent Reduction Committee of Dalu Fang on Rue Lutetia."</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Approves Order to Protect the Zhou Taipu Shrine Property</h3>
<p>Regarding the Zhou Taipu Shrine property related to the dredging of the Wusong River, due to a dispute among the Zhou clan, the municipal government issued an order yesterday to protect it. The original text reads: "According to the petition of Zhou Datong, the eighth-generation descendant of Zhou Taipu Shrine, 'I am the eighth-generation descendant of Taipu Gong, and I have the ownership of the special shrines in Songjiang and Shanghai, and the Zhoujiaqiao shrine property in western Shanghai. The former Qing government and county government have recorded it, and I have obtained the ownership certificate from your government and the land. Any member of the same clan shall not covet it. However, Zhou Shuchun (also known as Pu) and Zhou Bingjun (also known as Xianwen) from Tianmashan, Songjiang, pretending to be descendants of the shrine, colluded with members of the same clan from Houma, Shaoxing, the hometown of Taipu Gong, and jointly published a warning in the Shen Xin Min three newspapers on the 16th of this month to Mr. Wu Yunzhu of Tianchu Weijing Factory, because Mr. Wu established the Tianli Ammonia Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, about half a mile away from the Taipu Gong Shrine, which has nothing to do with the shrine property. When I went to the shrine, I knew this very well, but the Xinwen Bao newspaper reported on March 18 this year that the factory site was temporarily located in the Zhou Taipu Temple, so they took the opportunity to collude with members of the clan from the nation and published a notice in the newspaper warning Mr. Wu, and claimed that it should be fully preserved and submitted to the official authorities for handling. Now, Mr. Wu has entrusted lawyer Cheng Shangfeng to publish a statement in the newspaper on the 19th of this month, stating that the factory has nothing to do with the Zhou Taipu Shrine property, and criticized Zhou Shuchun and others for publishing the newspaper rashly without investigating clearly, causing confusion. The truth of this case has already come to light. However, Zhou Shuchun (also known as Pu) came in August last year and sent a letter pretending to be a descendant of the shrine, using absurd and outrageous words. After entrusting lawyer Wang Zhengshao to send a letter of warning on August 30, he disappeared. Who knew that his ambition would not die, and this time he colluded with clan members to publish a newspaper notice, repeatedly pretending to be a descendant of the shrine, which is against the law. According to the fact that I worship Taipu Gong and obtained the ownership of the shrine property, it is no different from Confucius having the Yansheng Gong to inherit. Otherwise, the same clan would covet it, what would it be like? If I do not request protection, it is not enough to warn the wicked and protect the shrine property. Therefore, I specifically submit three kinds of clippings, a Zhang Mayor's approval document from the 17th year (photo), a sixth district police station approval document from the 9th of this month (photo), and request your government to review and approve the protection so that the absurd people such as Zhou Shuchun and Zhou Bingjun can dispel their delusions and stop their treacherous schemes. The spirit of Taipu Gong will surely see it. In submitting this, I cannot wait for your order, I respectfully submit." He also attached three newspapers clippings, two photos of the approval instructions, and a clan map. Based on this, after investigating that Zhou Shuchun and Zhou Bingjun pretended to be descendants of the shrine, if this is true, it is clearly an attempt to obtain improper gains, which is very inappropriate. If the aforementioned situation occurs again in the future, the direct descendants of the shrine should be allowed to file a complaint by name to clarify the matter. In addition to the instructions on the submitted matter, a notice will be issued for protection, so that the public can know. This is the announcement."</p>
<h3>Trial Opens for Liu Shufan et al. Prosecutor Appeals, Claiming Original Sentences Too Light. Liu Shufan and Ren Sida Surrender Yesterday, Initial Inquiry Focuses on Bond Transactions</h3>
<p>Former Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, Liu Shufan, and the manager of the Shanghai branch of the bureau, Ren Sida, are accused of fraudulently establishing the "Sun Kee" account to use internal savings to purchase public bonds, disregarding interest, solely for personal gain, and neglecting the harm to the national treasury. Additionally, when Yang Jianping was the Director-General of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, he colluded with Zhao Baomin, the Shanghai branch manager, and Yang Peichang regarding land purchases. They allegedly inflated land prices twice, illicitly obtaining 135,000 taels of silver in illegal profits, acting as accomplices. Subsequently, the Control Yuan impeached Liu and Yang, and the First Special District Procuratorate investigated and prosecuted them according to the law. Except for Yang Jianping, who fled to evade punishment for participating in the Fujian Incident, the others had their initial trial concluded by the First Special Court. Liu Shufan was sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment, Ren Sida to one year, Zhao Baoshan to two and a half years, and Yang Peichang to one and a half years, each with five years of deprivation of public rights. During the appeal period, they were allowed bail. Details have been reported previously. It is now known that after the sentencing, Liu and the other three claimed to be dissatisfied and filed appeals to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court through their respective lawyers. However, the original prosecutor, Zhong Qing, believed that the sentences imposed on the defendants in the first instance were too lenient and insufficient to deter corruption and uphold the law. Therefore, he also appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting a more appropriate disposition. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang specially opened an investigation court to examine the facts of the case. Prosecutor Zhong attended the court to perform his duties. Only the appellants Liu Shufan and Ren Sida were present. Zhao Baoshan had gone to Hong Kong a few days prior because his mother was ill in his hometown. Yang Peichang claimed that his business in Hankou had been affected since the case occurred and had gone to Hankou to manage everything. Each was represented by their defense lawyers, who requested an extension. The court, noting that Liu and Ren had surrendered, proceeded to hear the part of the case concerning their purchase of public bonds for personal gain. The court first questioned Liu and Ren about their names, ages, hometowns, addresses, and occupations. Then, the court repeatedly questioned Liu Shufan about the purchase of public bonds. According to Liu's testimony, he assumed the position of Director-General of the Savings and Remittance Bureau in 1930 and relinquished it in January 1932. Although the general bureau was in the same building on Fuzhou Road, the offices were on different floors. Ren Sida was the branch manager. On October 20, 1931, Minister of Transportation Wang Boqun gave him 100,000 taels of silver, stating that it was for purchasing public bonds under the "Sun Kee" name and instructed him to keep it for safekeeping. He would directly introduce someone to contact Ren Sida at the branch. After receiving the silver, he deposited it and issued checks to Ren Sida, relaying Minister Wang's instructions. He stated that he did not know how the public bonds were purchased, the dates of purchase, the amounts of each transaction, or how the bureau advanced funds, as Ren handled everything. He also stated that on December 3rd, Ren withdrew 60,000 taels from his deposit, and on December 31st, he withdrew another 40,000 taels. He claimed that Wang Boqun was a key witness in the case and currently resided on Yuyuan Road, requesting that he be summoned for questioning. He also requested a thorough review of all the physical evidence, as the initial trial did not conduct a detailed investigation. Liu's lawyer, Liu Chongyou, wanted to supplement Liu's statements, but the court stated that today's session was an investigative hearing solely to review the facts and did not involve legal arguments, so there was no need for lawyers to speak on behalf of their clients. Next, Ren Sida was questioned. He was asked that since he was buying public bonds on behalf of "Sun Kee", and "Sun Kee" had 100,000 taels deposited in the Savings and Remittance Bureau, why was it necessary for the bureau to advance funds for the public bonds instead of using those deposits. Furthermore, before November 27, 1931, more than 230,000 taels had been advanced. Why should interest be calculated from November 27th instead of from the date of the advance? The advance in December amounted to over 170,000 taels, but interest was also delayed until the end of the month. However, the 100,000 taels deposited by "Sun Kee" accrued interest from the date of deposit. Ren's reasons were generally that the advances were initially recorded in a temporary account, making it inconvenient to calculate interest. Therefore, interest could only be calculated at the time of settlement. He explained the accounting procedures of the Savings and Remittance Bureau in detail. By this time, it was noon, and the court adjourned for a future hearing.</p>
<h3>City Ferry Nighttime Pleasure Cruises Break Past Records; Shanghai Residents Increasingly Aware of the Mental and Physical Benefits of Suburban Outings; Minhang Night Route Launched Last Night for First Time</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Ferry Management Office of the Shanghai Xingye Trust Company launched nighttime pleasure cruises, passenger numbers have been high in recent days, breaking past records. The office hosted city government officials the night before last, and the Minhang nighttime route also launched last night. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>(Breaking Past Records) Since the Wusong nighttime pleasure cruise route launched on July 1st, the Huangpu Riverbank has seen streams of carriages every night, and waves of fashionable ladies. They have been rushing to buy tickets at the ticket booth at the Bronze Man Pier. One boat was not enough to carry everyone, so they added another boat. The passengers were crowded, and they sometimes needed to have three boats running simultaneously. Recognizing that the number of passengers was high, breaking past records, the office made sure to reserve boats every night at the pier so they could depart at any time. According to Tan Boying, the Acting General Manager of the Xingye Trust Company, recently, fashionable ladies in Shanghai have increasingly become aware of the mental and physical benefits of touring in the suburbs. This is proven by the fact that there are more ferry passengers on days off than usual. After the launch of nighttime pleasure cruises, the cool breezes on the Huangpu River are refreshing, and the air is clean, an absolute contrast to the riverbank. Additionally, the facilities on the boats are perfect, so both Chinese and Western fashionable ladies enjoy them.</p>
<p>(Private Boat Rentals Increase Daily) The company originally established ferry rental measures, and the price is extremely low. Recently, more and more people have been renting boats from the company for suburban outings. Some examples are the British Barracks, Muirhead College, the Yousheng Travel Agency, the Economic Travel Agency, the Jianghai Customs Club, and the French Concession Public Works Department. All of them have been traveling in groups and using the boats for dining purposes.</p>
<p>(Hosting City Government Officials) The night before last (the 6th), the office hosted city government officials, taking the nighttime route to tour Wusong. Over 800 people attended from the Municipal Government, various bureaus, and their affiliated agencies and family members. They departed on three boats. Tan Boying, the Acting General Manager of the company, Deputy Manager Zhou Yanmin, and Assistant Manager An Zhongrui led the department directors in providing attentive hospitality. They did not return to Shanghai until 12:30 AM, having thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It is rumored that the company has scheduled to host Chinese and Western reporters from local newspapers next week, and the invitation letters are currently being prepared.</p>
<p>(Minhang Night Route Launched) Minhang is located on the southern Huangpu River, where the trees are lush, and the scenery is pleasing. The city market there is also extremely prosperous. The municipal ferry has been launching the Minhang nighttime route every Saturday and Sunday since last night (July 7th). It does not stop along the way. The departure time is 8:30 PM, and the return time is 12:30 AM. Last night, the first day of the launch, over 1,000 passenger tickets were sold.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zuming et al. Not Guilty; Incidental Civil Suit Dismissed; Main Text of the Second Special Court's Judgment</h3>
<p>Criminal Judgment of the Second Special District Court of Shanghai, Jiangsu ((22) Jie Di No. 4379) Judgment: Defendant/Incidental Civil Defendant Zhang Zuming, male, 28 years old, native of Ningbo, merchant, resident of No. 69, Yangzheng Middle Village, Tangshan Road, retained defense lawyers Jiang Yiping, Lin Yingqing, and Zhang Junying; Defendant/Incidental Civil Defendant Zhuang Jimeng, male, 21 years old, native of Ningbo, merchant, resident of No. 42, Huade Road, retained defense lawyers E Sen, Qiu Fenling, and Li Guozhen; Defendant/Incidental Civil Defendant Wang Lianyou, male, 30 years old, native of Zhenhai, salesman, resident of No. 931, Xiangyu Village, Hanbi Li Road, retained defense lawyers Fan Gang and Mao Xianshen; Defendant/Incidental Civil Defendant Tang Qingyue, male, 33 years old, native of Taicang, doctor, resident of No. 293, Gordon Road, President of Dade Hospital, retained defense lawyers Sun Ji and Chen Tingrui; Incidental Civil Plaintiff Zhou Jinggeng, male, 46 years old, native of Jiaxing, resident of No. 9, Aidoa Road, litigation agents Yan Luqing and Zhang Shanle. The above-listed defendants are accused of robbery. The case was prosecuted by the Police Department, and Zhou Jinggeng filed an incidental civil suit. This court judges as follows:</p>
<p>Main text: Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue are all not guilty. The incidental civil suit is dismissed.</p>
<p>Reasoning: According to the facts of a crime, judgment should be based on evidence. Also, a defendant's confession must not be obtained through coercion, threats, enticement, fraud, or other improper methods, and it must conform to the facts to be used as evidence. This is explicitly stipulated in Articles 282 and 280, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. In this case, after the defendant Zhang Zuming was sent to the police station by Zhou Jinggeng's partner, Gao Yushu, and detectives on suspicion of robbery, the defendant confessed to holding a gun and robbing No. 9, Aidoa Road, and named Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue as accomplices. The Police Department filed a prosecution with the court. The defendant firmly denied engaging in robbery, saying that when he was arrested, he was too frightened and temporarily confused, which led him to identify several friends as accomplices. In fact, on June 9th, he was at the Jiangwan Racecourse, which can be proven by Dong Zhengqing, Lin Pengfei, and Chen Zhiding. Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue all claimed to know nothing about it. Regarding this point, this court has repeatedly investigated. The judgments are separated below: (1) Regarding Zhang Zuming, according to the plaintiff Zhou Jinggeng's report to the Police Department, at 4:30 PM on June 9th, he was robbed of 12,000 yuan of Chinese Industrial Bank notes with the red characters "Jing" and "Bao". When Zhang Zuming was arrested, a Hengda Xiang passbook was found on him, which stated that he deposited 1,000 yuan in foreign currency on June 14th and 15th, which was claimed to be from the robbery. However, the defendant admitted to robbing 1,000 yuan on the 9th. If this was true, why did he withdraw 600 yuan on the 10th? Also, the banknotes deposited on the 14th and 15th were not red. Furthermore, Zhang Yunfang, the manager of Hengda Xiang, stated in court, "All kinds of banknotes are available." The Police Department sent detectives to investigate but did not find any Chinese Industrial Bank banknotes with the red characters "Jing" and "Bao". Therefore, there is no doubt that the 1,000 yuan deposited on June 14th and 15th was not stolen goods. Furthermore, the defendant took a car from Yunfei Car Company to the Jiangwan Racecourse with his uncle Wei Bingzheng et al. at 12:55 PM on June 9th, as proven by the driver of the car company, Xia Changsheng, in court. He also stated that he was cursed by the defendant for arguing about the price. When leaving the Racecourse, he saw Dong Zhengqing, Lin Pengfei, and Lin Xuezhang, and borrowed 50 yuan from Chen Zhiding. Dong Zhengqing, Lin Pengfei, Lin Xuezhang, and Chen Zhiding all provided responsible proof in court. Therefore, the statements made by Gao Yushu and the accountant of his firm, McRowe, that they saw the defendant holding a gun during the robbery are obviously misidentified. Besides this, there is no other positive evidence to prove that the defendant committed robbery. The reasons for the Police Department's prosecution are purely based on the confession during the investigation. However, as this does not conform to the facts, it cannot be used as evidence to determine the facts of the crime. According to the above-mentioned articles of law, the defendant cannot be convicted of robbery. Regarding Zhang Zuming, there is no evidence of a crime, and he should be acquitted. (2) Regarding Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue, the defendants were named by Zhang Zuming as the accomplices present at the robbery. When the defendants were detained by the Police Department, they each denied being involved in the robbery. Although the Police Department's investigation records contain Zhang Zuming's confession that he took Zhuang Jimeng's car to commit the robbery and received 1,000 yuan of the stolen goods in the car, the victim's report to the Police Department did not mention that the robbers escaped by car after the robbery. When questioned, Zhuang Jimeng admitted to owning a car, but it was always driven by a chauffeur, as he was not very skilled at driving himself. He argued that he had a quarrel with his wife that day (June 9th), and his sister would not let him go out. Therefore, he claimed that he stayed at the store from the afternoon to the night, watching plays and playing cards. Zhang Menghua and Weng Jianru testified in court that the defendant did not go out. This is consistent with the defendant's statement at the Police Department. Therefore, it is very obvious that Zhuang Jimeng was not involved in the robbery. Wang Lianyou was also named by Zhang Zuming and arrested. After repeated inquiries, he firmly denied any involvement in the robbery and claimed that he was at a foreign company in the afternoon and at the Hengda Xiang hardware store. Hu Yuanxiang testified in court that he saw Wang Lianyou at the store on the morning of June 9th. Sun Zhaofan testified, "I returned to the store at 3:00 PM on June 9th. After a while, Wang Lianyou brought the order and sat there for more than an hour, leaving around 4:00 PM or 5:00 PM." Thus, it can be seen that Wang Lianyou was not involved in the robbery. As for Tang Qingyue, from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM on June 9th, he was seeing patients at the Dade Hospital he opened, as can be seen in the consultation book. Patient Zhang Jiubei claimed that he took his child to Dr. Tang's hospital around 4:00 PM that afternoon. Chen Zhou claimed that she went to Dade Hospital at 4:30 PM to see Dr. Tang for a leucorrhea problem. Yin Fang claimed that she went to Dr. Tang's hospital at 3:55 PM to get a sunlamp treatment. Jin Meiyun, Wang Yuling, Hu Kejing, and other obstetrics students at the hospital testified that Tang Qingyue took the exam in the morning and saw patients at the hospital in the afternoon and did not leave the hospital. Therefore, it is even more doubtful that Tang Qingyue was able to be an accomplice in the robbery. From this kind of observation, it is sufficient to prove that Zhang Zuming's confession to the robbery and his naming Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, Tang Qingyue, etc., as accomplices are proven to be completely inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, his statement that he was too frightened and confused after being arrested is believable. In summary, the defendants were all arrested and brought to the case based on Zhang Zuming's statements. Since Zhang Zuming did not commit a crime, the defendants cannot be accused of robbery. Regarding Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue, there is no evidence to prove their involvement in the robbery, so they should be acquitted. (3) Regarding the incidental civil suit, a person who has suffered damages due to a crime may file an incidental civil suit during the criminal proceedings. This is explicitly stipulated in Article 506 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Since it cannot be proven that the defendants in this case committed a crime, and they have been acquitted, the incidental civil suit requesting compensation for damages has no legal basis. Regarding the incidental civil suit, there are no grounds, so it should be dismissed. 3. Based on the above discussion, the defendant's alleged crimes cannot be proven. Each should be declared not guilty, and the plaintiff Zhou Jinggeng's incidental civil suit should be dismissed. In accordance with Articles 316 and 509 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. This case, the prosecutor of this court, Wang Ren, presented his opinion in court. July 3, 1934, Li Changnian, Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court of Shanghai, Jiangsu. This document is certified to be identical to the original. Clerk.</p>
<h3>Scenes from the Drought Relief Rally in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, it has not rained for a long time. Crops are withering, rivers are drying up, and farmers' irrigation and the public's drinking water are facing total failure. Therefore, farmers in the western Shanghai area launched a drought relief rally, which was held simultaneously in various villages. The number of fabric dragons made totaled over one hundred, a spectacular sight with their marching and dancing. The gongs and drums were deafening, and the atmosphere was extremely lively. Dust billowed up into the clouds. Occasionally, young women would carry buckets of water on their shoulders and sprinkle water along the way. Others wore bamboo hats, straw raincoats, nailed shoes, and carried umbrellas, shouting, "Rain is coming! Rain is coming!" The strange shapes and hard work were all for naught.</p>
<h3>Ping Pong Championship Lawsuit: Hopes for Settlement through Mediation</h3>
<p>This year in the spring, the table tennis team of the China Jiande Association participated in the 7th Champagne Lincoln Table Tennis Tournament hosted by the Race Club. After months of effort, they repeatedly defeated strong opponents. The Jiande and Guangdong teams each earned 17 points and were ranked as top contenders. On May 19th, the tournament officials notified the Jiande and Guangdong teams to hold the final match at the Meifeng Table Tennis Hall. The Guangdong team requested a postponement due to the small venue, which the officials approved. The final match was rescheduled for the evening of May 26th at the original location. However, that time coincided with the selection of the Chinese team for the Far Eastern Table Tennis Tournament hosted by the China Table Tennis Federation. The Jiande and Guangdong teams believed that this selection was of great importance and related to national honor, so they all participated, which caused a scheduling conflict. Therefore, they jointly requested a postponement according to Article 7, Section 5 of the tournament rules, which states that "If both parties agree to postpone or change the location of the competition, they must submit reports and complete the supplementary competition within two weeks; otherwise, it will be deemed mutual abandonment." They believed that there was no reason to deny the request. The Jiande team members then participated in the preliminary selection. Unexpectedly, the tournament officials replied one hour before the final match, denying the postponement. Due to the time constraint, the Jiande team was unable to gather its members in time, so they did not attend. The Guangdong team attended, and the referee ruled that the Jiande team had forfeited once and was ranked as the runner-up. However, the tournament officials changed the referee's ruling, declaring that the Jiande team had withdrawn halfway, canceling their previous scores. The Jiande team believed that a withdrawal must be made by one's own request, so it could not be cited as a basis for the ruling. Furthermore, the declaration issued by the officials was sufficient to damage their reputation, so they could not accept it. Therefore, they applied to the court for mediation, requesting that the ruling be revoked as invalid. They had previously attempted mediation, but the Champagne Cup tournament officials insisted on not conceding, so the mediation failed. The Jiande team then hired Yang Ruinian, E Sen, and Yin Jingou as lawyers to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing the Champagne Cup tournament officials Li Hongde, Lu Xiniu, Shen Zhirui, Shen Dingyi, Lu Hanjun, and Weng Shoufeng of abusing their power and requesting confirmation that the ruling was invalid. This case is the first of its kind in the sports world, so it has attracted much attention from society. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Qinglan of the First Special Court opened the Fourth Civil Division to summon the defendants. Lu Xiniu attended with lawyer Wu Baoyang, while Yang Ruinian was unable to attend due to business and appointed lawyer Yuan Yangan as his representative. After Judge Zhang briefly questioned them, the two sides had been mediating through intermediaries and there might be hope for a settlement. Therefore, he rescheduled the hearing for 8:30 AM on the 19th. After the hearing, the reporter met with the person in charge of the Jiande team. According to him, the team has always been committed to upholding sports. This time, it was because of the illegal ruling by the Champagne Cup tournament officials that their reputation suffered great damage. Therefore, they had no choice but to resort to law to seek relief. Now that there is hope for a settlement, the team only needs to have its reputation restored and will accept the settlement within the realm of possibility. Therefore, this case may be resolved peacefully.</p>
<h3>Tram Runs Over and Kills Young Child; Driver Disregards Child's Life</h3>
<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, a tram ran over and killed a young child at the Dongxinqiao Sanlu Tram Station. The child's name was Li Hongfu, four years old, from Taizhou, and lived at No. 523, Chengdu Road, Xinzha Road. At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Li Hongfu saw that his aunt was going to the Infectious Disease Hospital on Xizang Road to visit a sick relative. Thinking it would be fun, he insisted on going with her. So, his aunt took him along. They took the Sanlu tram to Dongxinqiao. However, the aunt also had an eight-month-old child, whom she was also carrying. When the tram stopped, the aunt first took Hongfu off the tram before getting off herself. Unexpectedly, just as Hongfu's foot touched the ground, the tram driver, disregarding the safety of passengers, started the tram. Hongfu lost his balance and fell, his head landing near the tram wheel. As a result, he was seriously injured when he was run over. The onlookers were in uproar, and the driver only stopped the tram then. The child was already covered in blood and barely breathing. The nearby patrol officers heard the news and quickly recorded the tram number and took the driver to the Laozha Police Station. They also rushed the injured child to the hospital for treatment, but he died at 5:30 PM due to the severe injuries. The body was then sent to the Coroner's Office for examination.</p>
<h3>Sun Wende Survives Five or Six Gunshot Wounds; Assailant Detained Pending Sentencing; Assailant Acts Preemptively because Sun is an Associate of a Detective</h3>
<p>Sun Wende, a northerner residing at No. 5 or 6, Zhangjia Bang Pingfang, Gaolang Bridge, previously worked at the Shenxin Spinning Mill. He was dismissed in January of this year. Later, he worked as an associate for a detective in the Chinese and foreign concession areas. At 9:45 PM on February 12, while resting at home, a thug suddenly appeared and shot him in the shoulders and waist. Sun fell to the ground. Seeing that his objective had been achieved, the thug took the opportunity to flee without a trace. Sun's family quickly reported the incident to the police station. Chinese and foreign detectives rushed to the scene to investigate. The injured Sun was taken to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injuries were not fatal, and he recovered after a month of treatment. However, the assailant could not be apprehended. On the 10th of last month, Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Concession Police Station arrested three robbers from Funing, Xu Fasheng, and seized two live ammunition pistols. After the Second Special Court questioned Xu, he was sentenced to four years of imprisonment. It was then learned by Shen Yuzhou, the Chinese detective chief of the Yangshupu Police Station, that the robber Xu was the assailant who shot Sun Wende. He requested the First Special Court to send a letter to bring Xu, along with a No. 554 pistol and six bullets, back to the police station. They were taken to the Third Criminal Court, where Xu denied the charges and was detained for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui held a hearing. Li Zhishan, the lawyer for the Public Works Department, stated that it was later discovered that the defendant and the victim used to be apprentices in the spinning mill and were acquaintances. The defendant associated with robbers, while Sun worked as a detective in the Chinese Concession Police Department. Therefore, the defendant acted preemptively and committed this heinous act to prevent Sun from arresting him. The No. 554 pistol, four bullet casings, and one bullet were found at the scene of the incident. A Western gunsmith identified them as matching. Furthermore, the defendant has a black mark under his left eye, which was described when the incident was reported. The victim and witnesses are all present in court and request to be questioned. Please examine the pistol and prosecute. According to Sun Wende's report, the defendant ran up behind him at the time and said, "I'm inviting you to return to your hometown!" Then he shot him in the left shoulder and waist. Sun fell to the ground, and the assailant fired several more shots before fleeing. His younger brother, Sun Wenqing, testified that he witnessed the defendant break in and shoot his brother. There were five or six shots in total, and then the assailant fled. When questioned, Xu Fasheng stammered and was extremely cunning. Judge Liu ruled that he would be remanded in custody and a date would be set for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Two Female Workers Beat Shen Jin'e to Death: Dispute Arises from a Minor Matter, Leading to a Violent Assault by Two Female Workers</h3>
<p>Shen Ruisheng, age 41, from Dongshan, Suzhou, resided at No. 5 Hongxing Lane, Changxing Road, Taiyang Temple, Zhabei. He made a meager living and had only one daughter, named Jin'e, now 18 years old. She worked as a female laborer at the Tongyi Yarn Factory, leaving early and returning late, as was her custom. At around 6:30 PM the day before yesterday, Jin'e finished work at the factory and was on her way home, taking the ferry at the waterworks (commonly known as the small ferry). While Jin'e was standing at the front of the ferry, another factory worker from out of town, Fu Longzhenzi, Sheng Zhenzi, and others pushed and shoved, stepping on Jin'e's feet. Jin'e was inexplicably teased and immediately questioned Longzhenzi and the others. Unexpectedly, Longzhenzi was equally unwilling to back down and retorted sharply, almost leading to physical violence. Fortunately, they were dissuaded by fellow passengers. When the ferry docked and everyone disembarked, Shen Jin'e had only walked a few steps from the boat when she reached the entrance of the No. 6 warehouse inside the Maigen Road station. The two women, Fu Longzhenzi and Sheng Zhenzi, caught up from behind and spoke rudely, leading to another verbal altercation. Then, Longzhenzi and the others grabbed Jin'e and beat her, kicking her repeatedly. Jin'e was, after all, a frail woman, unable to withstand the assault of four hands. She was beaten to the ground on the spot. However, Longzhenzi and the others were still not satisfied and continued to beat her brutally. Jin'e sustained serious injuries and was barely breathing, unable to get up from the ground. Seeing the magnitude of the disaster they had caused, Longzhenzi and the others tried to escape. However, they were seen by bystanders who intervened and called the police, who arrested the assailants, Fu Longzhenzi and Sheng Zhenzi, and detained them at the Railway Police Department for interrogation. Meanwhile, the injured Shen Jin'e was carried to the Chinese Red Cross Hospital on Xinzha Road for treatment. Unfortunately, she suffered severe internal injuries and died shortly after, before receiving adequate medical attention. Shen Deng, the mother of the deceased, rushed to the hospital upon hearing the news and mourned over the body. Yesterday morning, the Railway Police Department ordered Chen Quansheng, the local security officer of the Tianziwei First Map area in Zhabei, to report the incident to the local court for an inquest. Shen Deng, the mother of the deceased, also filed a petition with the court, seeking justice for her daughter. Her statement roughly stated that she had only one daughter, named Jin'e, who was 18 years old and worked at the Tongyi Yarn Factory. Her husband, Shen Ruisheng, made a meager living but was often at home resting due to his poor health. Therefore, the family of three relied on Jin'e's income to make a living. Now, she had been brutally beaten to death for no reason, which was unbearable. She requested an investigation, and the court accepted the petition and awaited examination.</p>

<h3>Yacht Race: Glory for the Chinese</h3>
<p>Shanghai's Westerners have an organized yacht club that holds annual races on the Huangpu River. The competition is fierce. The Chinese members include only Li Jingmei of Hefei, Tang Baoshu, Director of the Postal Remittance Bureau, Gu Zhongqing of the Exchange Bank, and Xiang Liansun of the Hechang Awning Company. Last Sunday, the winner of the yacht race at the Wusongkou</p>
<p>The competition for the Fair Cup is a major race that requires sailing around the outermost buoy outside Wusongkou. It is held only once a year and is highly valued by the members, who all put in their best effort. In addition, there was an extremely strong monsoon that day, which made the race dangerous but also more exciting. The race started at 9:00 AM from Wusong. The sails were hoisted high, and the boats sped through the waves like shuttles. After leaving Wusongkou, the waves were treacherous. Mr. Xiang Liansun on the yacht</p>
<p>was often in the water, with only glimpses of white sails fluttering on the sea. It was truly a grand sight. As a result of the competition, Xiang Liansun's No. 5 yacht won the championship (Note: Mr. Xiang was the only Chinese member present that day).

<h3>Zhabei Epidemic Hospital Opens</h3>
<p>Due to the hot weather since the start of summer, the General Red Cross Society of China has been concerned about the spread of epidemics. Many poor people suffering from illness have died because of financial difficulties. In order to popularize medical treatment for the poor and sick, a temporary epidemic hospital has been established at No. 1036 Xinmin Road, Zhabei, organized by Wu Yulin, Zhou Hongzhang, Yang Zantang, Shen Jintao, Bao Ning, and others. Wang Peiyuan was publicly elected as the director. The opening ceremony was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. More than 100 people attended, including Wang Binyan and Gong Xikui. The hospital can accommodate more than 120 beds, divided into first, second, and third classes. The first class costs two yuan per person per day, the second class costs one yuan, and the third class is free. Medicine is included. Before the opening, the hospital had already received more than 400 outpatient registrations and admitted more than 10 inpatients. The funds are allocated by the head office, about 1,000 yuan per month. Due to the high cost, assistance from all sectors of society is highly anticipated. According to the director of the hospital, Wang Peiyuan, this year's long drought has led to a particularly serious outbreak of epidemics. Special attention should be paid to drinking water. Unboiled water should not be consumed. The water in Zhabei, Beixinjing, Caojiadu, Xiaoshadu, Pudong, and along the Suzhou Creek is particularly unsanitary and should be treated with caution. Therefore, most patients come from the areas mentioned above. It is worrying that many patients only take Chinese medicine or mistakenly believe in scraping therapy instead of going to the hospital. He also said that as it is midsummer, the epidemic is still on the rise. Judging from recent trends, this year's epidemic will be worse than in previous years.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the local news column in your newspaper on the 2nd of this month, which reported that the fishery groups held a joint meeting yesterday, stating that a joint meeting was held at the Shanghai Fishery Association at 1:00 PM on the 1st, with more than 20 representatives from the freshwater fish, cured meat, fishing vessel, iced fresh fish, salted fish, and City Fishery Association, including Xu Wusun, Dai Jusheng, and Jin Chuxiang, and that the meeting was chaired by Jin Chuxiang, and after formalities, the following resolutions were passed: (1) Requesting the Ministry of Industry to provide relief to fishing villages and implement the establishment of fish factories in the producing areas, (2) The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM, etc. We were deeply alarmed to find that this information is completely inconsistent with the facts. Our association received a notice from the joint office of the Shanghai fishery groups, stating that the second meeting was scheduled to be held at the guildhall of the iced fresh fish industry at 1:00 PM on July 1st. Our association was requested to send representatives to attend and discuss. Our association regularly sent Secretary Shen Dingcheng, clerk Ru Shaoshan, etc., to listen in on time. Subsequently, Mr. Xu Yangshan stated that due to the small number of attendees today, the meeting could not be held as scheduled and had to be rescheduled. The date would be announced later. The secretary and others then excused themselves and left, without signing in or attending a meeting of the City Fishery Association. Furthermore, our association is the Shanghai Fresh Fish Industry Guild, not the freshwater fish industry. It is appropriate to clarify this. We are sending this letter specifically, hoping for a prompt correction. Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fresh Fish Industry Guild, July 6th.</p>
<h3>Reading and Answering Questions: Relative Truth and Absolute Truth – Answering Messrs. Chu Zhaoyin and Ji Shanshan –</h3>
<p>On the 4th of this month, we discussed the issue of subjective truth and objective truth. Closely related to this issue are the concepts of relative truth and absolute truth. While this topic is frequently mentioned in many philosophy books, most of them simply state the conclusions without providing explanations. As a result, many readers do not understand how to resolve this issue and often write to inquire. Because there are many people who are confused, we must provide a public response.</p>
<p>The central question is: Why does the most advanced modern philosophy believe that absolute truth is the sum of relative truths?</p>
<p>In old philosophy, relative truth and absolute truth are opposed and incompatible. When truth is relative, it is not absolute; when it is absolute, it is not relative. Because relative truth varies with time, place, and person, while absolute truth is</p>
<p>eternal and universal. The former changes constantly, while the latter remains unchanged. Things that change and things that do not change are of course incompatible. Therefore, the French positivist philosopher Comte advocated relative truth and thus did not recognize the existence of absolute truth. On the other hand, the Neo-Kantianists who advocated absolute truth did not recognize the so-called relative truth. The opposition between relative truth and absolute truth was very strict in the history of old philosophy.</p>
<p>To resolve this problem, we feel we must ask: What is truth? Truth is the reflection of objective reality in the human mind. In other words, truth must be able to reflect the essence of external things. "All men are mortal" is truth because in fact all men do indeed die. If in fact people did not die and we insisted on saying "All men are mortal," then it would not be truth. Thus, truth is the objective thing reflected in the human mind. However, human observation is limited, and not all things can be reflected in the human mind at the same time. Humans can only begin to recognize truth in things that they can experience, and more precisely, only within the scope of their practice. And the scope of their practice varies depending on the state of the society in which they live. For example, in primitive hunting tribes, human life is unstable, and the "death" they see is almost always death from injury and bleeding. Natural death is very rare to them, so their concept of death is different from ours. They believe that death from bleeding is real death, while natural death is just like sleep. Thus, the truth about death reflected in the minds of primitive hunting tribes is relative to their practice and is an incomplete truth. And from this example, we can see that truth is relative, limited by human practice.</p>
<p>But since relative truth is truth, it must also be a true reflection of things. Therefore, it is not as those who advocate only absolute truth say, of no value whatsoever. It is only incomplete. "Death from bleeding" is the hunter's only concept of death, but this concept can still apply in our modern concept of death. However, modern people's understanding of death is richer and more complete. In addition to death from bleeding, there is also death from illness, death from old age, etc. Our lives and practices allow us to see more forms of death than the hunters, so we have a more complete truth about death. Or it can be said that what we know about death is absolute truth, while the hunter's death is relative truth, because the hunter only recognizes death relative to the single event of bleeding, while we know that "all men are mortal."

<h3>First Week of Summer Military Training for This City's First Batch is Going Well: Luo Yi, an Official from the Nanchang Headquarters, Arrives in Shanghai for Inspection. Yesterday's Report of a General Training Assembly in Nanshi is Inaccurate.</h3>
<p>The first batch of summer military training for high schools and above in this city has been underway since July 1st. Everything is proceeding well at each school. Luo Yi, an official from the Nanchang Headquarters, will arrive in Shanghai within the day for inspection. Yesterday's report of a general training assembly in Nanshi is completely inaccurate. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(First Week of Training Completed) This time, schools are implementing three weeks of rigorous summer training. The first batch began on July 1st. Each school has established academic and practical courses in accordance with the temporary measures for summer military training. During the first week, practical courses completed individual training, squad and platoon training, and preliminary fortification and field exercises. Academic courses completed military interior affairs and essential wartime matters. Starting in the second week, important subjects such as combat training and live-fire shooting will be implemented.</p>
<p>(Good Situation in Various Schools) During the first week of the summer military training in this city, the weather was hot, so practical training was carried out at 4:00 AM, just as dawn broke. Instructors and students are working very hard. Although students were initially afraid of getting up early, they have gradually become accustomed to it and feel no hardship. The campus layout is completely militarized, and student soldiers take turns on guard duty every day and night, showing no fear. When reporters passed by the gates of various schools, they almost doubted that they were educational institutions.</p>
<p>(Headquarters Sends Personnel for Inspection) Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to summer military training in various places, so special personnel have been sent to inspect them separately. It is reported that the Nanchang Headquarters has appointed Luo Yi to come to Shanghai to inspect the summer military training achievements of various schools in this city. Mr. Luo is currently inspecting in Xuzhou and will come to Shanghai after visiting Nanjing. Commander-in-Chief He Chongti and Chief Instructor Chen Zhaoxin of this city will accompany him to the various schools at that time.</p>
<p>(No Joint Training Assembly Yesterday) Yesterday's report that Minli, Jiaoye, and Shanghai Middle School and other schools gathered in Nanshi for general training was denied by the Shanghai News Agency reporters after inquiries with the National Military Training Association and the authorities of the schools. Since this city lacks large barracks, it is not possible to implement joint training. Except for Tongji University and Merchant Marine School, which are conducting joint training in Wusong in the first batch, the rest are training individually. Provincial Shanghai Middle School is not within the scope of military training in this city, and Private Shanghai Middle School is far away in northern Shanghai, so there is no reason to conduct training in Nanshi. Since Minli and Jingye schools are training individually, the report of a general training assembly in Nanshi yesterday morning is completely inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Strict Implementation of Summer Military Training at the Municipal Xinlu Normal School</h3>
<p>After receiving the order to implement summer military training, the Municipal Xinlu Normal School immediately worked with the school's military instructor, Zhou Daming, to actively prepare. Dean of Students Yuan Gong served as the director of general affairs, and Pan Gongwang stayed at the school to assist with everything. From July 2nd to July 21st, the most rigorous military training will be carried out continuously for three weeks. Since the start of classes, all daily life and drills have been in accordance with military interior regulations, and management is no different from the military. In order to cultivate student barracks life, the diet is also very simple. There are four hours of practical courses every day, mostly involving field exercises, combat, training, and fortification construction. There are two hours of academic courses. From morning to night, there is almost no rest, but the students show no fatigue and are quite able to endure hardship and are keenly interested, studying with concentration. Instructor Zhou of the school does not hesitate to work hard and often gives spiritual lectures to the students during roll call every night, encouraging the students to take on the responsibility of saving the country and revitalizing the nation, recovering lost territories, and vowing to avenge the national humiliation. All the students are moved by this. Furthermore, the school has received an order from the Education Bureau that tuition and dormitory fees will be waived, and half of the food expenses will be subsidized from the next semester. The school will recruit two first-year high school normal classes next semester. In order to facilitate the candidates, the school is borrowing the Wanzhu Primary School on Nine Acres of Land to handle the enrollment matters. Registration begins immediately, and the entrance examination will be held on July 14th and 15th.</p>
<h3>The China Science Society Strives to Solicit Papers for the Annual Meeting: As of Yesterday, 100 Papers Have Been Received. The Paper Committee, including Zhu Kezhen, Engages in Sorting.</h3>
<p>The 19th Annual Meeting of the China Science Society, which is scheduled to be held at the Lian Gu Youth Association in Guling, Nanchang, for six days starting on August 11th, has been actively prepared by the organizing committee members Xiao Shushu, Cheng Bolu, Yang Yunzhong, Dong Shijin, Hu Buzeng, Zhong Zhongxiang, and others. In view of the fact that only 40 to 50 papers were submitted by domestic and foreign members for last year's annual meeting, which was not enough to fully represent the large number of professional talents of the members, this year's annual meeting has made great efforts to solicit papers. As of yesterday, 100 papers have been received. They are now being sorted by the paper committee members Zhu Kezhen, Zhang Jingyue, Xie Jiarong He Yanfan, Cao</p>
<p>Liangxia, Mao Yisheng, Gu Yiqun, Ye Qisun, Wang Jiaji and others. The society also pays great attention to the lecture matters of the annual meeting, and has a complete system plan for science education. The lecture topics are divided into two categories: science education in middle schools and production and construction. The lecture committee members Hu Xingxian and Wu Xianwen and others have invited experts to serve as lecturers. Regarding the travel issues of members attending the meeting, an application has been submitted to the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways to provide preferential treatment as usual. The most distinctive feature of this annual meeting is that the Chinese Botanical Society, the Zoological Society, and the Geographical Society will participate in the annual meeting at the same time, bringing academic groups together, which is very rare.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains the Establishment Methods of Public and Private Primary Schools</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to a report from the Jiangsu Education Department, stated that primary schools in various counties of the province often have elementary levels funded by county education funds and advanced levels funded by private funds, and are jointly established, called public primary schools. There is also a school where half of the funds are subsidized by the government and half are raised by local people, called public or district primary schools. After investigating the reasons for this phenomenon, it is found that most of the time, the government's financial resources are insufficient, and the local people have a strong desire to start schools, so they propose a public-private cooperation method to help each other and facilitate children's enrollment. Although this method inevitably has the suspicion of mixing public and private, in the past, because there were no clear restrictions, it was allowed to be established as a temporary measure and was not interfered with, which is also a different method to reduce out-of-school children. However, since the promulgation and implementation of the Primary School Law, the name of public has lost its basis for existence, and the aforementioned public-private joint schools are obviously in violation of the reporting order. However, if they are suddenly banned uniformly, not only will countless students enrolled in the school suddenly lose the risk of dropping out of school, but also the government is afraid that it will not be able to fully undertake the task of taking them back to the government. Now, various counties are sticking to their habits, and applications for the establishment of such schools are still pouring in. Should these schools be allowed to exist or be established? If they are allowed to exist or be established, what kind of name should be used? Since half of the funds are from private sources, should a board of directors be established? If a board of directors is allowed to be established, what is the scope of its powers? Is the appointment of the principals of these schools still handled according to the regulations of general public schools? Please instruct, etc. The Ministry of Education ordered that these primary schools should be allowed to exist or be established to benefit education. As for the crowning of the school name, it should be decided by the competent education administrative organ in consultation with the private donors. In principle, those with more public funds should be called county or district primary schools, and vice versa, they should be called private primary schools. However, if public funds are used as subsidies, such as calling private primary schools, the board of directors should be set up in accordance with the regulations of private schools, and public and private parties should each appoint a certain number of directors according to the proportion of the funds contributed to organize it, and select the principal to run the school in accordance with the regulations. Those called county or district primary schools need not form another board of directors, and they will be handled in accordance with the county or district primary schools, but the donors may propose plans for running the school to the education administrative organs for reference by the education administrative organs.</p>
<h3>Renowned Painter Exhibition Sponsored by Xinhua Art College Opens Today</h3>
<p>The renowned painter painting exhibition sponsored by Xinhua Art College is being held by Xu Langxi, Wang Yachen and others. Dozens of professors and renowned painters from the school have been invited to exhibit more than 200 masterpieces from the past year. All of them are roughly packed. Starting from 9:00 a.m. today, the Chinese painting exhibition will be held for eight days at Jingtu Nunnery, Gulang Road, Xizang Road in this city. For the convenience of general viewers, the visiting time has been specially extended until 7:00 p.m. Art lovers in Shanghai should not miss it.</p>
<h3>Guangdong People's University Inspection Group Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Guangdong National University is a private university in the southwest. Its achievements are remarkable. It has only been in operation for seven years, and the number of students has reached 2,000. Now, the graduates of the school are taking advantage of the summer vacation to organize several inspection groups to conduct inspections in different ways. The first group, the social inspection group, arrived in Shanghai on the 7th. The second group, the industrial inspection group, will also arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. According to the members of the group, they plan to stay in Shanghai for ten days and then go to Beijing. They will take the Jinpu Line to Pingjin, pass through Suiyuan, and come back. Then they will take the Pinghan Road through E, Xiang and Gui back to Guangdong. The inspection period is set for three months, and they plan to conduct inspections on the news industry in Shanghai and have contacted various schools.</p>
<h3>Fudan Experimental Middle School Will Move to Jiangwan and Plan to Build a New School Building</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported the news that the Public Concession of the First Special District issued subsidies to private schools. Regarding the schools whose subsidies were stopped, there was a sentence in it that "Fudan Experimental Middle School should move out of the concession before the end of July." Recently, inquiries were made to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, the Public Concession, and Fudan Experimental Middle School, and it was learned that the information was inconsistent with the facts. According to the person in charge of the Municipal Education Bureau, the original letter from the Public Concession to the Bureau stated that "except for Fudan Experimental Middle School, which may move out of the concession before the end of July, it is not convenient to accommodate other schools." Moreover, Fudan Experimental Middle School has already decided to move into Fudan University in Jiangwan in its entirety starting in the autumn, and is planning to build a new school building, which shows that its relocation is entirely voluntary.</p>
<h3>Bai E Painting Tutoring School Relocates to a New Location</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bai E Painting Tutoring School, which has a long-standing reputation, has been well-managed for several years and is developing steadily. It has long been trusted by society. The school originally had more than 100 students. For the enrollment of this year's summer class, those who came to register were also very enthusiastic. The school was once destroyed in the January 28th Shanghai Incident and suffered heavy losses. Later, it moved to Avenue Edward VII and actively prepared for its revival. Thanks to the efforts of the founders Fang Xuegu, Chen Qiucao, Pan Sitong, and others, it was able to restore its former glory. Recently, due to the carelessness of the neighboring house, the school building was badly damaged and needed to be repaired urgently. Therefore, it was temporarily moved to No. 231, Intersection of Carter Road and Shanhaiguan Road, at the beginning of this month to start school. The interior has been perfectly arranged. The summer class is now scheduled to officially start on July 10th. Those who aspire to learn painting can register and enroll in the school as soon as possible. It is reported that the professors of the school's summer class this year are particularly cautious about the guidance tasks and pay attention to the implementation of basic technology.</p>

<p>Three Strong Tianjin Basketball Players, Li, Liu, and Yin, Will Come to Shanghai on August 3rd</p>
<p>All Entering Great China University</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Tianjin) Li Zhenzhong, Yin Hongxiang, Liu Zhenyuan, etc., who represented our country in the Far Eastern Basketball Team, returned to China from Manila. Li stayed in Shanghai and participated in several Great China University expeditions, all of which were victorious. Liu and Li returned to Tianjin last week to visit their families and will return south after about a month to study at Great China University. In addition, there was previous news about Yin Hongxiang and Liu Zhenyuan going to Shanghai to study at Great China University, but this news has been quite quiet recently. After inquiries from reporters to Yin and Liu, it is confirmed that it is true. Yin and Liu have now met with Li Zhenzhong, and the three have agreed to leave Tianjin and go south together to Great China University next month on the 3rd. Yin will enter the university, and Li and Liu will enter high school. All three of Li, Yin, and Liu are famous players in the Tianjin basketball scene. Unfortunately for Tianjin, the loss of these three players will greatly reduce its strength, and the winner of the 18th North China Games championship is still difficult to predict.</p>

<p>Lingnan, Although Defeated by the Customs Office, Still Holds an Optimistic View of the Championship</p>
<p>Lingnan has the highest profile in the Shanghai Group. Yesterday, they fought against the Customs Office and were defeated by the Customs Office, creating the same situation for Lingnan and the Customs Office. According to the current situation, Lingnan has more wins than the Customs Office. For the championship issue, Lingnan still has great hope. However, Lingnan still has one game against Jingxiang K, and the Customs Office also has one game against the Green Team. Guessing the battle situation of the two teams, Lingnan winning Jingxiang K is easy, and the Customs Office winning the Green Team is difficult. Now, the results of yesterday's game are announced below.</p>
<p>Team Name, Group, Score, Referee</p>
<p>Kang Le defeated White Cat Association, 4 to 2, Sun Shanfu</p>
<p>Zero Team tied Tang Li, Bing, 1 to 1, Kong Hongbao</p>

<p>Supplementary Resolution:</p>
<p>Regarding the Hongling Jia protest against Dongxing for including unregistered players in the competition, the executive committee decided that Dongxing would forfeit with a score of 1 to 0.</p>
<p>Warning to Hongling Jia:</p>
<p>According to the referee's report, in last week's game against Dongxing, a Hongling player disregarded the referee's ruling and behaved indecently by insulting the referee, which is a great loss to the athlete's physique. Zhou specially warns the team captain to restrain the players and prevent them from engaging in any more out-of-bounds behavior and to maintain sportsmanship.</p>

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<p>How Are You All Preparing to Spend the Summer Vacation?  Lin Yin</p>
<p>Children, the summer vacation has arrived. How are you preparing to spend it? If you all think of it as a holiday, and that holidays are for playing, then you are greatly mistaken!</p>
<p>Don't think that because you've finished reading the old books and the new ones won't be distributed until the fall semester, there's nothing to do during this time. Feel free to play to your heart's content. You must know that books can never be finished. Even the old books you've already read can provide new knowledge and allow you to improve. Confucius' saying, "Reviewing the old and knowing the new," means just that. Moreover, if you put your studies aside and play all day long, your knowledge will greatly regress by the time the fall semester starts!</p>
<p>Therefore, as this long vacation approaches, I sincerely ask all of you children to create a summer work plan in advance so you don't carelessly waste your time. I think the following two tasks can be offered as reference for everyone: (1) Review old lessons. Or attend summer tutoring school so your studies don't become neglected and your knowledge improves. (2) Help neighbors or people in your own home who can't read. (Regardless of age) Teach them to read and write. This work not only applies your own abilities and practices your own knowledge, but also promotes universal education in society! However, the emphasis is on implementation. I hope all of you children can work hard consistently, without interruption, without starting strong and finishing weak, and strive forward!</p>
<p>Edison's Childhood  Liu Zhongxi</p>
<p>Children! Do you know that there was a great American inventor named Edison? As a child, he only attended school for a little over three months. His teacher often scolded him for being an unteachable child. Later, he dropped out of school and started a laboratory in the cellar, collecting over two hundred empty bottles. He saved the money he would have used to buy candy and used it to buy chemicals. If it wasn't enough, he would sell newspapers to earn money. He spent all day experimenting with chemistry in the cellar. When he didn't understand something, he would ask others. His mother guided him in his other studies. Later, he went to sell newspapers on the train and even set up a laboratory in the train's baggage compartment. One day, the train suddenly derailed. Because the shaking was so severe, the chemicals he had placed on the table all fell to the ground and caught fire. The guard saw this and was very angry. He went up and slapped Edison, causing his eardrum to become permanently deaf. He remained deaf until he was old. He didn't get angry after being slapped. Instead, he said it kept him from being distracted. Later, he moved back to his own home and continued to experiment with chemistry. As a result, he became a great inventor. He himself said that his success came from hard work and perseverance!</p>

<p>Why is Ice Placed on Top?  Du Xin</p>
<p>To prevent food from spoiling, Min'er's father bought a refrigerator. Min'er had never seen a refrigerator before, so he curiously looked at it for a while. Later, he said to his father:</p>
<p>"Dad, this refrigerator is probably not good, is it? The ice is placed on top. What does it have to do with the food?"</p>
<p>Dad smiled and said, "Min'er, you don't know this principle, do you? Let me tell you now. The reason food doesn't spoil in the refrigerator is because the air is very cold. Cold air goes down. Therefore, we have to put the ice on top so that the cold air flows down. If we did as you said and put the ice on the bottom, then the food on top wouldn't be exposed to the cold air from the ice and wouldn't it still spoil? That's why the ice has to be placed on top."</p>
<p>The Books I Like  Bo Zhen</p>
<p>As a curious person, I often hear teachers say: when XX substance and XX liquid are mixed, they become XX thing. When XX gas and XX are mixed, they change into XX. I find this kind of knowledge really strange.</p>
<p>I also know that science occupies a very important position in people's clothing, food, housing, and daily life, and that the future world will definitely be an extremely developed scientific world.</p>
<p>So I went east to inquire and west to ask, and searched the old book stalls to see if there were any simple science books suitable for my level. Once I bought them, I would read them, no matter how much money it cost or how much time it took.</p>
<p>Every time there was a holiday, I would be in a quiet place, reading science books with relish, often forgetting to eat lunch!</p>
<p>I predict that the future world will definitely not be an ordinary world. Science is already very developed now. So what about the future? Science will definitely be even more developed.</p>
<p>I believe that people who don't have scientific knowledge in the future will definitely not be able to stand on their own in society. If they can't stand on their own in society, they will definitely be eliminated! Extinct!</p>
<p>Children! Work hard! Work hard! Hurry up and put in effort in science! Don't regret it in the future: "When young, if you don't work hard, when old, you'll only be sad!"</p>
<p>Advise Children Not to Learn to Be Naughty  Yangtze River</p>
<p>Although naughty children can also do great things and achieve great careers, and there are indeed examples of great figures in history who came from naughty children, I always feel that being naughty is definitely not a praiseworthy behavior. The fact that great figures were naughty in their childhood only shows that they had strong personalities and were capable. However, their later achievements still depended on their own cultivation, the nurturing of their parents, elder brothers, teachers, and friends, as well as the rigorous training provided by the environment. If one relies solely on being naughty, then one's future is undoubtedly bleak, and one cannot even dream of becoming a great figure.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I was passing by North Sichuan Road when some water suddenly splashed on my head. I looked up and saw a Japanese child in a Japanese shop spitting a mouthful of water from the balcony. When he saw me stop, he shrank back inside. Half a month ago, a neighboring Japanese child threw a mud clod at the back building of our house. The landlord told their parents about it, and as a result, the child harbored resentment and ruined the spring lock on the back door with tar mixed with mud. I feel that the widespread naughtiness of Japanese children is deeply related to their becoming an aggressive nation that is viewed with suspicion by the world today, because they have been accustomed to being naughty since childhood. I hope that Chinese children will not be infected with their bad habits.</p>
<p>Generalissimo Chiang promotes the New Life Movement, which first calls for cleanliness and order. Naughtiness is, of course, the enemy of order. I hope that children can unanimously abandon it!</p>
<p>Work Hard and Eat More</p>
<p>In the previous issue, the picture "Work Hard and Eat More" by Yian Jun was made slightly smaller, and the names of the dishes indicated were blurry and unclear. Therefore, it is specially enlarged above.</p>
<p>Small Can Control Large  Zhang Nancun</p>
<p>Ants are very small animals. When they unite as a group, they can surround and kill insects larger than themselves to eat. This is something we often see. There is also a kind of small fish that can eat cattle crossing the river, as well as all kinds of large things. Isn't that strange?</p>
<p>This small fish is called piranha. It is produced in the Amazon River and has sharp triangular teeth. It is only about one and a half feet long. As long as a few fish bite the blood out of an animal, thousands of their kind will gather to surround it. One bite here, one bite there, a whole large animal will be completely transformed into food for these countless small piranhas.</p>
<p>Because there are these fierce little fish in the Amazon River, people in this area dare not bathe in the river. If they encounter them while bathing, even if they are not bitten to death, they will suffer serious injuries.</p>
<p>From this perspective, Japan, a small country, annexed our vassal state of Korea, cut off our Taiwan, and unjustifiably occupied our four northeastern provinces, advancing step by step, trying to control our fate. Our country has 35 million square miles of land and 400 million people, and yet we are controlled by these petty clowns, which is the same as being controlled by piranhas, where small can control large.</p>
<p>Piranhas can control large because of their collective effect. Japan dares to be so rampant, but it is also because it is very good at uniting as a group. If we in our country all work together with one heart and unite as a group, it is not difficult to control small with large! Children, you see, isn't uniting as a group very important?</p>
<p>Correspondence from Rural Children  Zi Ming</p>
<p>Firefly</p>
<p>Dear children:</p>
<p>Night has enveloped the earth, everything is silent, and all the animals have probably gone to sleep. But the frogs and toads are still making a lot of noise.</p>
<p>A gentle breeze blows, bringing coolness to the world. The moon in the sky is smiling and boasting about its light to the stars. The fireflies in the grass are angrily coming out, emitting light from their tails as they fly east and west, very proud of themselves.</p>
<p>"Fireflies glow red every night, Grandma weaves cloth, Grandpa carries water." Friends, what does this nursery rhyme mean? It means that our countryside is very busy, and even the elderly have to do chores, which shows how busy the adults are. Therefore, there is a saying here: "When the frogs croak, a thousand sedan chairs are needed to hire workers." The farmers are busiest at this time of year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the flickering fireflies don't think that their light is too small to be bright, but they like to gather in groups. Small pests are often killed by them. They are beneficial insects, but many young children use cattail leaf fans to catch them, which is really a pity!</p>
<p>Friends! I have a wild idea: even a small insect can emit light. If humans followed its example and emitted light in proportion, wouldn't there be no darkness in the world forever?</p>
<p>The Boy Selling Ice  Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>"Selling ice! ...Selling ice!"</p>
<p>This is the voice of Su, a nine-year-old boy. His voice is so loud that almost everyone can hear it wherever he goes.</p>
<p>Su is a child from a poor family. His father works as a laborer, and his mother works as a servant for others. Because he also has to eat, he thought of this ice-selling business in the summer. He wanted to earn a few cents from selling ice.</p>
<p>The sun is high in the sky like a fiery umbrella, baking the asphalt road soft. Su walks on the hot and humid road, with the sun on his head and sweat dripping down like raindrops. He is very thirsty! But he doesn't dare to take a small piece of ice from his basket to quench his thirst. He is afraid that if he has one cent less of income, he will go hungry!</p>
<p>He passes by the school gate and sees many students reading in a ventilated classroom. He passes by the park gate and sees many children playing in the shade of the trees. He is really envious, but he is a child from a poor family!</p>
<p>Despite the hot weather and the difficult road, Su still carries his basket, sweats, and shouts, "Selling ice! ...Selling ice!" to make a living.</p>
<p>How to Make a Submarine  Danru</p>
<p>Children 1, aren't you longing for a wonderful toy? Let me tell you here, making a submarine is a very easy thing. First, take a piece of thick wood and make the hull, as shown in the second picture, and then make the deck on the boat according to the third picture. A on the board is a turret, which can be replaced with a cork. B is the periscope on the boat, made of round wooden strips, with the tip tightly inserted inside the cork. After it is made, glue the turret to the deck, and glue the deck to the top of the hull according to the first picture.</p>
<p>Now we are going to make the moving machine. Make a strip of wood as shown in the fourth picture, drill a hole in one end, and nail the other end to the tail of the submarine, as shown in the first picture.</p>
<p>The propeller of the submarine, as shown in the fifth picture, can be cut out with a tin shear. If you don't know how to make it, you can buy it at the tin shop for a few copper coins. Then take two small iron hooks, one tightly nailed to the lower abdomen of the front section of the submarine, and one threaded into the hole in the wooden strip at the tail of the submarine, so that it can move freely, and then tightly connect the propeller to the end of this hook, as shown in the first picture. Finally, take a rubber band and tie it tightly between the two hooks, and the submarine will be completed.</p>
<p>It is best to paint some colors afterwards; the color of the boat is gray, the deck is green, the turret is black, the periscope is white, and the propeller is red, which will be very beautiful.</p>
<p>How to play: Carefully rotate the propeller to tighten the rubber band, hold the hull with one hand, and gently place it in the pool; when you release your hand, the submarine will drive away in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>Seven Wonders of the Three Ages 丨First Talk About Ancient Times丨  He Gongchao</p>
<p>(1) Pyramid (2) Great God Statue (3) Hanging Gardens (4) Great Lighthouse (5) Great Temple (6) Sun God Statue (7) Great Tomb</p>
<p>For thousands of years, we humans have used a lot of blood and sweat to build many great projects. In ancient times, there were seven wonders, in the Middle Ages there were also seven wonders, and in modern times there are also seven wonders. However, the seven wonders of modern times are not projects, but... (What are they? Children, please guess). Today, I will first talk about the seven wonders of ancient times, and then I will talk about the wonders of the Middle Ages and modern times.</p>
<p>The first of the seven wonders of ancient times is the Egyptian pyramid, which covers 13 acres. Think how big it is! Of the seven wonders of ancient times, only it is still preserved, and the rest are gone. The second is the Great God Statue in Summer Peiya, which is four feet high, not counting the platform. The third is the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, which were built on a foundation 300 feet high, as if they were hanging in the air, so they are called the Hanging Gardens. The fourth is the Great Lighthouse on an island in Alexandria, whose light could be seen within a hundred miles around. Think how tall and big it is? The fifth is the Dina Temple in Ephesus (belonging to Asia Minor), which is 342 feet long and 164 feet wide. Some of its broken tiles and rubble are still preserved in the British Museum in London. The sixth is the Sun God Statue on the island of Rhodes (in the Mediterranean Sea), which is 105 feet high and took 12 years to build. The seventh is the tomb of Mossolus, which is located in Halicarnassus (belonging to Asia Minor). A small part of its broken walls and rubble are also preserved in the British Museum in London.</p>
<p>Ancient Seven Wonders</p>
<p>Plum Rain and Mold  Bing Yu</p>
<p>(Plum rain) is a term that originated in our country, and refers to the season of rainfall when plums are ripe. During this season, the climate is humid and the temperature rises. Fine, drizzling rain falls from time to time. Although this rain makes people feel mentally depressed and uncomfortable in their daily lives, it is very important for agricultural crops. If there is no rain, agricultural crops will often have poor harvests. What is the reason for the occurrence of plum rain? Because every year at this time of year, the Yangtze River area is directly exposed to the sun and develops a low pressure. This low pressure moves eastward. Coincidentally, the ice in the White Sea Strait begins to melt between March and April, becoming a cold current. This cold current stays near the east coast for about three months, flowing back and forth. Because the high pressure of the cold current is very dominant, it often clashes with the eastward-moving low pressure from the Yangtze River, and turns into misty drizzle. During the period of broadness, there is often indigestion and susceptibility to digestive diseases. Birds and animals shed their feathers, and the most annoying thing is the rapid reproduction of mold.</p>
<p>(Mold) is a non-flowering plant, belonging to the fungi class. It is an extremely fine filament that floats in the air. Its spores attach to objects and multiply. There are many types, depending on the climate and location. Commonly, Mucor and Green Mold are the most well-known. Mucor grows on cakes and food, and its hyphae grow on the surface of the food, with black sporangia containing many spores. Green mold grows on clothes, hats, shoes, or food. Its spores mature, turn green, and scatter in the air. Black mold is similar to green mold and also grows on food. At first, it is a colorless mold bacteria filament, which gradually turns into black spores. These molds are all harmful to hygiene. During plum rain, due to the relationship between moisture and water, its spores can multiply everywhere. For example, if it flies to dirty clothes, it relies on the dirt on the clothes for nutrients and multiplies. If it flies to food, there are even more kinds of food for it to use as nutrients, so it is naturally easy to multiply. It loses its reproductive power in dry, clean places, so during the plum rain season, because the climate is gradually humid, there is abundant moisture, and the temperature rises, it can multiply everywhere. We should pay special attention to our clothes, food, and utensils during this season.</p>

<p>Women's Garden, Issue 21</p>
<p>In Memory of Madame Curie  Zi Jiu</p>
<p>The world-renowned Madame Curie passed away on the 4th of this month in Valence, France!</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, I felt nothing but regret. In this century when most women in the world are still ignorant and submissive, Madame Curie is like a giant star in the darkness. Now that this giant star has fallen, how can one not feel saddened?</p>
<p>Madame Curie was born in 1867 in the village of Warsaw, Poland. Her childhood name was Skloboodouskaya Mary. From a young age, she was determined to study science. When she grew up, she married Curie, and the two worked together on chemical research, discovering the new element "radium," which is a necessity for treating cancer. She received the Nobel Prize for this discovery. Unfortunately, Curie died unjustly. In her grief, Madame Curie continued her research. Although she lived in poverty, she never slackened. In 1907, an American wealthy man gave Madame Curie a laboratory, and from then on, she had more complete tools. Afterwards, although there were often huge donations from all sides, Madame Curie used them to purchase radium for experiments, in order to improve and refine her research. She never wanted to use money for meaningless consumption. During the European War, she worked even harder on relief work, saving thousands of lives. She devoted her life to benefiting humanity, regardless of hardship and fatigue. Therefore, Madame Curie is not only a great scientist and a savior of mankind, but also the only role model for women!</p>
<p>Compatriots, looking around us, cowardice, dependence, vanity, ignorance... Other than these, what else do most women show today?</p>
<p>Where is the Chinese Madame Curie? When will China have talents like Madame Curie? Some people say that the current Chinese society and the current Chinese environment will not produce a Chinese Madame Curie. But society can be transformed by human power, and the environment can be reversed by willpower. In addition to mourning Madame Curie, I hope that all my compatriots will have the spirit of Madame Curie.</p>
<p>On Adultery and Murder  Bi Wu</p>
<p>In the East, women have always been treated like mindless sows. It is said that if a Muslim encounters his own woman on the street without her face covered, he has the right to kill her. The situation in China is not much better. Women are strictly forbidden to show their faces in public.</p>
<p>The recent situation is truly a sight to behold. On the one hand, licentious sounds, licentious colors, licentious dances, licentious movies, and licentious singing are greatly popular. On the other hand, the drama of catching adulterers and murdering them is constantly being staged. Somewhere there is a dismembered female corpse, somewhere wild dogs drag out a bound foot. These are all news stories of husbands killing their adulterous wives.</p>
<p>These old tricks being rehashed are certainly not being promoted by anyone like flying kites or kicking shuttlecocks. However, no one has been heard to sternly eradicate them. In this season of "ancient customs," if one allows this natural trend to continue, it will undoubtedly intensify day by day.</p>
<p>Under the constraints of the rites and laws, a woman is willing to risk death to have a secret tryst with another man, her married life is undoubtedly not satisfactory; and among the reasons for that dissatisfaction, it is often because the husband is having an affair. In this situation, who should die?</p>
<p>The French female writer George Sand once wrote in her works, "Hypocrisy is the thing that most defiles women. So-called adultery does not occur when she gives herself to her lover, but when she later shares a night with her husband." However, most husbands not only believe that they have the right to force a wife who has given herself to her lover to share a night with them, but also believe that they have the right to kill her for sharing a night with her lover. Like the monarchs of the autocratic era, because they possess special privileges, they take everything for granted, and their shamelessness is indescribable.</p>
<p>The Mongolian desert, Hanhai, is still a desert to this day; the Himalayan mountains of Tibet have always been snow mountains and are still snow mountains to this day. If everything is left to nature, it can naturally remain unchanged for a long time. If we want to be like a civilized country, how should we impose various sanctions and enlightenment on this feudal and barbaric behavior of adultery and murder from a political and social perspective?</p>
<p>Thinking of Duncan Because of Mei Lanfang  Yi Gouwu</p>
<p>Recently, the issue of Mei Lanfang going to the Soviet Union seems to have aroused a lot of discussion. However, at this moment, I thought of Isadora Duncan, who shook Europe.</p>
<p>This association is not without reason. First, Duncan's fame in Europe is really somewhat like Mei Lanfang's in China, and she also went to Russia. Second, I once had the fate of meeting this genius dancer once. The time was more than ten years ago, and the good time was just like the hot weather we have now.</p>
<p>Saying that Duncan in Europe is like Mei Lanfang in China is really too abrupt for Duncan, but what is meant here is only the magic in society. As for the art represented by Duncan and her existing contributions, they are naturally not at all the same as our Mr. Mei.</p>
<p>My meeting with Duncan was at a summer resort in a Swiss family in the countryside of Paris. There were many guests present that day, and Duncan seemed to be an unexpected guest. Her attire was very simple. Surrounded by many people, she talked and laughed loudly. Undoubtedly, one could tell at a glance that she was an extraordinary artist. I only shook her hand twice, and the words I exchanged were only two sentences, or maybe only one and a half sentences, but the impression she gave of being magnanimous and independent could not be erased no matter what.</p>
<p>The reason why this talented woman can move people's hearts is certainly due to her art, but also due to her courageous revolutionary spirit. Her daring to act and her support for truth are rare not only among modern women, but also among men. Among the countless deeds in her life, almost nine out of ten have a revolutionary spirit. The most widely circulated is that she was surrounded by university students on the streets of Berlin and asked to give a speech. She pointed to the statue</p>

<p>These unemployed workers are mostly highly skilled and have a high standard of living; they are also a class with high consumption. When they lose their jobs, it not only makes it difficult for them to live, but also affects the sales of various goods they consume. In the United States, the number of unemployed workers reached a peak of 13,000,000, but now private enterprises have found jobs for 2,750,000 unemployed, 350,000 are serving the public, and another 350,000 are working in local government agencies. As for the agricultural and industrial sectors, they are still continuously hiring workers. According to the authorities, the government will need to hire many more workers in August and September of this year. Direct employment may reach a million. In the United States, the unemployment problem is still very serious. The only reason is that there are not many investors now. If private individuals or the government were to invest $1,000,000,000 to develop new businesses, then at least one million unemployed workers could get jobs!</p>
<h3>Turkey's Five-Year Industrial Plan Meng Bai</h3>
<p>Turkey's first five-year industrial plan has now begun. The authorities plan to invest a total of US$35,000,000 in fixed capital during this five-year plan. In order to have the slogan "Implement Apron Independence," they have decided to start four large-scale state-owned yarn factories first. Although Turkey produces a lot of cotton, the import of cotton cloth, used exclusively to make aprons for slaves working under the economic system, has totaled US$450,000,000 in the past decade. In the economic field, the Mustafa Kemal government paid more attention than any other. Turning Turkey from a primitive agricultural country into an industrialized country capable of industrial self-sufficiency is indeed not an easy task, and it is certainly difficult to achieve in a short period of time. The Turkish government had previously consulted American and Turkish experts engaged in mining, industry, and agriculture in the eastern gold mining area and the southern cotton area to collect reports and conduct research before deciding on this five-year industrial plan.</p>
<p>Officialdom. After the implementation of the five-year plan, the capital of $35,000,000 invested in the five years, after a study, can guarantee that imports of finished goods will be reduced by 30% within five years. The industries to be prepared for immediate implementation are limited to those with raw materials produced in Turkey, such as cotton, silk, iron, coal, artificial ivory, wood pulp, goat hair, sulfur, etc., which will be manufactured into finished goods first.</p>
<p>Various important industries are operated by the state, and private operations are limited to small-scale industries, such as lace, velvet, porcelain, sulfur, and other small enterprises. The construction loan of five million from Russia, equivalent to US$8,000,000, is specifically used to purchase machinery for yarn factories. They plan to open many yarn factories in Kayseri, Nasıri, Konya, and Adana. Machinery for a jute weaving factory and a power plant will also be purchased from Russia. This loan does not bear any interest and is intended to be repaid in twenty years with Turkish products.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Amusement Park's Artistic Performances Yi Ding</h3>
<p>The amusement park in Shanghai is originally designed to entertain the old masters and madams. Not to mention that the price of admission tickets is as expensive as half a month's living expenses for us small clerks, even the programs performed do not suit our taste. For example, what "songs" and what "dances" are nothing more than a display of flesh and lust. But the McLaren Amusement Park is completely different. The McLaren Amusement Park is really worth a dollar to see. I watched the evening show on June 30, which was a very hot day. The venue was very small, in a corner on the second floor of the YMCA in Baixianqiao. When I first stepped in, I almost wanted to back out, because I instinctively felt that it was a risky thing. If the audience was too crowded, then you would not die from the heat, but you would suffocate. However, I finally succumbed to the attraction of the entertainment programs and the reluctance to throw away a dollar lightly, and after hesitating for a while, I sat down again. The entertainment programs are many, but due to time constraints, in addition to the Chinese Harmonica Team's harmonica ensemble, only two plays were performed: "Nora After Leaving Home" and "Storm on the Yangtze River." Now, let me write down some of my opinions on these two plays. "Nora After Leaving Home" is a three-act play. The author cleverly linked together several recent events with special social significance to form a prelude to anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, giving the audience a sense of reality. I think this cleverness should be emulated by all playwrights. The meaning of this play is to point out how a knowledgeable woman in the current society should seek liberation. In the first act, through the peasant uprising in Iran, it points out that to demand liberation, one must resolutely oppose imperialism; in order to oppose imperialism, one can resolutely abandon one's family and one's dearest husband, if the husband is in danger of becoming a traitor. In the second act, through the suicide of Mrs. Qin Lizhai, it points out the cannibalistic crimes of the old society and education, and that to demand liberation, one must resolutely escape from the shackles of feudal society and old etiquette. In the third act, the issue of women's employment is touched upon. In this era when unemployment panic is sweeping the world, where can such a lady go to find a job? Therefore, it points out that one must join hands with working women, lower one's standard of living, and be able to endure hardships like working women. This is really the compass for the current Chinese women's liberation movement. The problem that Ibsen did not solve is completely and correctly solved here. Regarding the performance, I think the most successful ones are Hu Ping, who plays the wife, and the role of the mother. Hu Ping's resolute expression in the first act is very exciting. The second act is most movingly performed by the mother. Her stubborn and profound character is appropriately expressed. Especially her lines and movements can follow the tension and relaxation of the plot without any excess or deficiency. The next best is Zhao Dan, who plays the son, who is lively and playful, and the miserable struggle after taking poison fully demonstrates his unique talent. The biggest shortcoming is the actors who play the patients in the third act. Their lines are not clear, and they have no acting at all, which detracts from the whole play. Also, when they were about to leave the hospital, the husband who came to see his wife, slipped off the stage from under their noses during the sound of firecrackers, which is also one of the shortcomings. "Storm on the Yangtze River" is a one-act opera, completely a new form. The author uses anti-imperialism as the backbone, unifying three different types of workers on the docks on the anti-imperialist front, and singing the final cry of resistance. In terms of performance, it is more successful than the former. Each actor expresses their strength through various expressions. If the stage is rotating, when they sing the song of resistance loudly, it will be able to show the heroic spirit of excitement and progress even more. After watching this play, I left the venue extremely satisfied, completely without feeling the heat.</p>
<h3>Science Saves the Nation: Soviet Chemical Workers Wen Xiong</h3>
<p>Chemistry now occupies a very important position in all sectors of Soviet national production. This is because it is related to the manufacture of artificial fertilizers and artificial compounds 丨丨 used to eliminate all pests and beasts on farmland 丨丨 potassium and light gas compounds, artificial products in wood The production of Vitamin, the production of good-quality chemical coal (mixed and burned oils), pigments, building materials, etc. Before the war, Russian chemical enterprises only did the work of selling foreign goods and could not meet the needs of society. After the establishment of the socialist country, there was often a desire for more fertilizers, so new chemical plants were built extremely importantly. "National collectivization, the country demands the production of artificial fertilizers" This slogan gave farmers confidence in the effectiveness of artificial fertilizers. Now farmers who are using new methods of farming have already understood the benefits of artificial fertilizers, because using this fertilizer can expand their harvesting scope and make their work easier at the same time. In order to meet various needs, millions of tons of artificial fertilizers were produced extremely importantly. In the Tsarist era, it was not possible to produce 200,000 tons of sulfuric acid from imported semi-finished products, but now a chemical plant in Leningrad alone can produce more than 200,000 tons of this chemical. The Ural factory produces 4,000 tons of sulfur, a product that had to be imported from abroad not long ago. The factories in Bobriki and Voskresensky have played a huge role in Europe. In 1933, the production of artificial fertilizers was in a ratio of 100 to 74 compared with 1929. In terms of price, the total production price of various chemicals in 1929 was 243,000,000 rubles, 450,000,000 rubles in 1931, and 935,000,000 rubles in 1932. The development of the chemical industry is progressing in parallel with the increase in the number of workers. In 1927-28, the number of unemployed workers in the Soviet chemical industry was 25,000, in 1929 it was 11,000, and by 1931, unemployed workers in the chemical industry had been completely eliminated. In 1931, there were 149,349 workers working in the chemical industry; in 1934, the number increased to 240,000. Therefore, in three years, as many as 90,000 workers were placed in the chemical industry. In the Soviet Union, new technologies and rationalization of production do not cause workers to reduce or to produce material phenomena to continue to occur. On the contrary, when the huge chemical plants in Bobriki, Bershusniki and Voskresensky were built and functioned according to the latest technology, unemployment was also eliminated at the same time. The new technology makes it extremely easy for workers to complete their work; at the same time, working hours in the Soviet Union have also been shortened to six to seven hours, and in some places even to four hours. The increase in wages is growing at the same time as the development of production. Comparing 1932 with 1931 alone, the wages of coking coal chemical workers have increased by 58%, and basic chemicals have increased by 38%. The average monthly wage of a worker in 1931 was 103 rubles; in 1932 it increased to 131 rubles, and in 1933 it reached 139 rubles. Wages have also increased indirectly and nominally. This is the organization of suburban production (AprdurbaNastrumo), which gives workers the opportunity to obtain cheap meat, milk, butter, vegetables, etc. In 1932, workers obtained 170,000 tons of milk, 136 tons of meat and 478 tons of vegetables from suburban production. In order to assist suburban production and improve the living conditions of workers, the trade union of chemical workers alone provided 1,400,000 rubles as subsidies in 1933. The main areas of the Soviet chemical industry are in the uninhabited forests of the Urals and the grasslands of central Russia; therefore, socialist cities are being built at the same time as factories. In the dense forests of Bereniski and on the uncultivated wilderness, there is now a city with a population of 340,000. In order to build cities in the center of the chemical industry, 34,000,000 rubles were spent in 1931 and 79,000,000 rubles in 1932. These funds were used to build 260,000 cubic meters of the most comfortable housing in 1933. Social insurance is a powerful organization during the period of dictatorship. The fund of this organization is estimated to be worth 4.5 billion rubles, which was transferred from professional organizations after the merger of the Labor People's Committee and the Central Soviet of Trade Unions. The chemical workers' union received 79,000,000 rubles from this fund and distributed it to each member. When an illness occurs, workers can receive full wages for six months. In 1932, wages were paid for 792,577 days of illness for workers, totaling 3,478,000 rubles, which means that each worker was allocated an average of 4.05 days. Every year, many sanatoriums, lounges, and medical rooms are available for workers to use at will. Last year, 25,582 workers recuperated in such recuperation institutions. The number will increase to 29,422 next year. In the Soviet Union, women have various rights and participate in various construction works completely like men. They can completely and without distinction from men be a locksmith or a people's commissar. When they work in the factory, they are completely free from the shackles of the head of the family and the child's caregiver, because this liberation allows women to fully gain the possibility of advancing and evolving in ability on par with men. Among the 48,000 women working in the chemical industry, 2,100 children were born in 1932. Mothers received a total of 155,000 days of wages for the pregnancy and childbirth period, totaling 568,996 rubles. During the period of breastfeeding and preparing necessities for children, each mother can receive an additional maintenance fee of 75 rubles. In addition to this, each mother can also receive a one-hour leave period per day for breastfeeding. Furthermore, in order to make the work of raising children easier to solve, each factory has organized child care centers and children's rooms. Working women can simply entrust their children to them while they are working in the factory. In 1932, the trade union of chemical workers spent 12,000,000 rubles to improve children's rooms. The canteens set up in the factories further liberated women from the burden of preparing meals at home. By 1932, a total of 48 schools specially opened for chemical workers had been completed; 24,000 students were studying here. Ten higher chemical schools were opened in 1929, and seventeen had already been opened in 1932. Students can also receive stipends for the entire time they are studying. This kind of stipend is extremely substantial, allowing students to focus on their studies during their learning period without having to look for extra income to maintain their lives. The newly built clubs have become the central place for workers' cultural rest and social education. The club of the chemical factory in Bereniski has a hall that can accommodate 1,100 guests, a theater that can accommodate 300 people, forty rooms of various styles for reading and holding research meetings, children's halls, physical culture halls (for sports), foreign workers' and experts' halls, technicians' lounges, technical lounges, etc. There is also a music cinema that can accommodate 1,500 spectators. Workers can freely rest and play in the club, and most of the knowledge and skills they need are also learned here. The opening of clubs and schools also increases the basic wages of workers, just like the additions to workers' wages.</p>
<h3>Current Affairs Research: What We Should Know About the German Incident Chen Songjie</h3>
<p>(I) ······(I)</p>
<p>On June 30, a shocking incident suddenly occurred in Germany. Hitler took decisive action against several leaders of the Stormtroopers who had been called the backbone of the National Socialist Party in the past few years. Regarding this matter, the news from various news agencies is confusing, and the comments from newspapers in various countries are also extremely inconsistent. Some sing praises, thinking that Hitler truly deserves to be a great figure of the times, who can put righteousness before kinship and stabilize the German political situation; others say that these extravagant and dissolute Stormtrooper leaders were all cultivated by Hitler himself. This action of his is just enough to expose the ugliness of the National Socialist Party itself. The first type of public opinion is mostly seen in Germany, which is issued under the pressure of guns and is not enough to be relied upon; the second type is seen in French and American newspapers, which is just a venting of anger and slander, and does not grasp the center of the facts. Although there are also a few newspapers in China that have a skeptical tone towards it. They are probably far from the facts.</p>
<p>Since the news and discussions are so complex, it is difficult for newspaper readers to obtain the truth of the facts. The author is not talented, but is willing to contribute a little of what I have learned from studying the German National Socialist Party for the past two years to everyone.</p>
<p>(II) ······(II)</p>
<p>"When the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked!" This is originally a political convention. The German "June 30th" incident also has a bit of this meaning, but this meaning is very slight. In fact, it is due to the dissatisfaction of the young and middle-level members of the Stormtroopers with Hitler's increasingly right-wing tendencies. This dissatisfaction had been brewing for some time, because at first Hitler's power in Germany was not as stable as it is today, and these anti-establishment elements also accepted some discussion, so it did not become an incident. Since the end of last year, Hitler has outwardly gained the support of the entire nation. The reason for this is partly due to the clamoring of these Stormtroopers members from petty-bourgeois backgrounds, but the main reason is that the big bourgeoisie has gradually recognized that Mr. Xi can be a political tool and gave him great assistance. Thus, the relationship between Hitler and the big German capitalists is closer than when he came to power in early March last year. In this way, those so-called "socialist" political programs that the Stormtroopers members used to call on the masses immediately lost their "cash value." As a result, disagreements often arise between the upper-level leadership and the lower-level work and propaganda organs. The main tool used by the young leaders in the Stormtroopers to fight against the enemy party when seizing power was to seize the factory committees of various factories. However, in order to gain the trust of the workers in the factory, they could not help but take the interests of the working masses as their position and have necessary disputes with the factory owners, and even violent conflicts. The contradictions thus became serious. It is impossible for a political party to represent the interests of workers and collude with capitalists at the same time. Moreover, there are other factors involved. Finally, because the benefits given to Hitler by the big capitalists were much more useful to the actual use of the National Socialist Party, Hitler's attitude became more and more right-wing in fact. In June and July last year, National Socialist Party leaders Hitler, Lei Yi (commander of the Labor Front Team), Schmidt (Minister of Economic Affairs), and Erer (Minister of Justice) all successively published articles and important talks, prohibiting workers from infringing on factory management rights and confirming that business owners are the natural leaders of factories in order to protect the interests of large capitalists. Thus, the National Socialist Party not only actually left the workers, but also became a tool for large capitalists to oppress the workers. The division within the National Socialist Party thus became an inevitable fact.</p>
<p>(III) ·················(III)</p>
<p>Here, I will copy a little of the "socialist" political program announced by the National Socialist Party before it seized power in January last year, so that readers can better understand the extent to which the party's words and deeds are contradictory.</p>
<p>Articles 10 to 21 of the party's program are written as follows:</p>
<p>(10) The first duty of a citizen must be to engage in mental or physical labor. ······</p>
<p>(11) Abolish income obtained without labor, and eliminate the "slavery of interest."</p>
<p>(12) ····All profits obtained from war must be completely confiscated.</p>
<p>(13) We demand that all large enterprises that form "joint stock companies" (referring to trusts) be nationalized.</p>
<p>(14) We demand participation in the distribution of profits in large enterprises.</p>
<p>(15) We demand a large-scale improvement of "old-age pensions."</p>
<p>(16) We advocate that "large department stores" be immediately taken over by the urban area, and their houses be rented to small businessmen at low prices.</p>
<p>(17) We demand the formulation of a "law for confiscating land without compensation," abolishing land rent, and preventing various land speculation.</p>
<p>(18) Oppose usurers······.</p>
<p>(19) We demand that the German "common law" be replaced by the "Roman law" of the utilitarian world order.</p>
<p>(20) In order for every talented and hardworking German to receive higher education, the German national education system should be fundamentally reformed.</p>
<p>(21) The state must protect mothers and young children in order to improve the health of the people, and prohibit child labor.</p>
<p>These political programs have played a very significant role in promoting Hitler's control of the German regime. However, today, a year and a half after he came to power, the cartelization of German enterprises is becoming more and more obvious; in addition, the prohibition of small businesses, the appointment of large capitalists as important personnel in government agencies, etc., these political programs have long been thrown into the wastepaper basket! (See page 23 of the first issue of the Labor Quarterly published by Nanjing Zhengzhong Bookstore)</p>
<p>(IV) ···········(IV)</p>
<p>This incident was obviously brewed by these contradictions. Since Hitler did not hesitate to violate the solemn political program of the party he led, how could he be reluctant to kill dozens of "comrades" who had shared his hardships? According to reports, more than 3,000 people have been arrested, and there is no confirmed report on the number of victims. Because of this incident, Hitler will be more deeply invested in the arms of the big capitalists and become their tool. However, his lower-level foundation has been completely lost. I think that he will at most become a second MacDonald in Britain in the near future, otherwise that will be his downfall!</p>

<h3>The Eve of World War II Feifei</h3>
<h3>Woodcut Science Series: The Story of the Invention of Airships for Saving the Country Through Aviation (V) Shulin</h3>
<p>The balloon rose slowly, reaching about 500 feet in twenty minutes, and gradually drifted towards the suburbs with the wind, landing five miles from the starting point.</p>
<p>This was the first record of mankind's air travel by balloon. On the ground, from the residents of the city of Paris to the people in the countryside, they all looked up at the sky and admired it in unison.</p>
<p>The above is the situation in France. At that time, in England, on September 15, 1784, Vuson and Lunatai first made a balloon, which was released in London. The whole town climbed onto the roof to watch, causing a commotion.</p>
<p>A month later, James, Santra, made a new balloon. Santra was called the father of the British aviation world. Since then, he has made many balloons and made various flights, but he has repeatedly encountered dangers. Once, he bravely attempted to cross the English Channel, but was blown into the sea by headwinds, and almost lost his life because of this.</p>
<h3>3. The Origin of Airships</h3>
<p>Seventy years later, in 1852, Guifford made a balloon with a three-horsepower engine, but the result was not good. It could only travel in still air without wind. The speed was three meters per second. It had cost a lot of money to make this balloon, and Guifford had to stop halfway.</p>
<p>Next, a German, Helen, made a new airship with a small gas engine and a four-wing propeller. The propeller revolved about 40 times per minute. However, Helen used gas instead of light gas, and the results were not good. The speed was five meters per second.</p>
<p>In 1884, Kaipaden Schnat made the French airship, using an electric braking propeller and equipped with a rudder to determine the direction of left and right. However, the speed of this airship was still slow, and it was not easy to maneuver freely, so it was not practical. The speed was six meters per second.</p>
<p>About sixteen years later, a young man named Saite Sesta Mont, born in Brazil, established a special record in the history of aviation. In the history of the development of airships, Mont must occupy a place. After several failures, Mont finally completed the last airship.</p>
<p>At that time, the German government was encouraging the manufacture of airships, and if someone could drive an airship from the Sacrat district and circle the Eiffel Tower once, they would be given a reward of 3,000 pounds.</p>
<p>The young Mont responded to this reward with an airship he made himself. On October 9, 1901, he departed from the Krat district, flew for more than nine miles for 30 minutes, circled the Eiffel Tower once safely, and returned.</p>
<p>Mont's success shocked mankind all over the world. Airships gradually reached the dawn period in the early 20th century. From the time when Luge rode a balloon and flew with the wind to the time when Mont's airship appeared, about a century had passed. The progress of the invention world was just like the crawling of an inchworm. The aviation world, which had been in a state of distress, began to make rapid progress after Mont's success.</p>
<p>Germany, France, and the United Kingdom competed to build airships. Among them, Germany's Zeppelin airship achieved superior success.</p>
<p>Whether airships or airplanes are superior cannot be generalized. They each have their own strengths depending on the time and place. Airships are large and can carry more gasoline and goods, and can fly long distances. After the European War, airships often made transatlantic crossings. In 1926, Italian Major General Nopiler drove the Noe Kai airship to make an unprecedented Arctic transatlantic flight.</p>
<p>However, airships also have their shortcomings. For example, in air combat, they are easily attacked and caused accidents by agile airplanes due to their slow movements. Also, airships are most afraid of encountering storms and usually have to be stored in hangars, and the large body requires a lot of construction costs.</p>
<p>As a result of the competition among countries to build airships, many accidents occurred in the air and many unexpected disasters were suffered. For example, Wilmann's airship, which was exploring the Arctic, was shattered into pieces due to a storm.</p>
<p>Frenchman Lapee Brett's airship was blown away after the mooring rope broke in a storm while it was mooring, and blew across England into the distant Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The first airship built by England caught fire and was burned while it was mooring, and the first airship built by Zeppelin was also destroyed by a fire. Sepalo's airship caught fire in the air, and Mr. Sai and his assistant fell from a height of several thousand feet, were smashed to pieces and lost their lives. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of the Shi En Charity School Building - Solely Funded by Mr. Zhu Shi'en, a Ningbo Businessman in Shanghai - | Took Seven Years and Cost 160,000 |</h3>
<p>The private Shi En Charity School on Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, in this city, was founded by Mr. Zhu Shi'en, a Ningbo businessman residing in Shanghai. It was established in the seventh year of the Republic (1918). Initially, there were over a hundred students. Year by year, thanks to the excellent guidance of Principal Zhu, the number of students increased from just over one hundred to over eight hundred. Consequently, the old school buildings became insufficient. Seeing that many children were displaced and without education, Mr. Zhu spared no effort and, starting in the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), purchased adjacent land and began construction of a new, state-of-the-art four-story school building. It boasts ample light, thorough and clean sanitation facilities, and cost over 160,000 silver dollars, taking over seven years to complete. Mr. Zhu worked tirelessly, supervising and designing day and night. Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, a grand and solemn opening ceremony was held. Over a thousand guests from all walks of life, Chinese and foreign dignitaries, and businessmen came to the school to offer their congratulations. In the afternoon, there was a parents' meeting, and in the evening, a variety show. Students' achievements were also displayed throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Japanese Correspondence School Relocates - New Address: Chinese Arts and Crafts Society - The School Continues to Enroll Students</h3>

<h3>World Amateur Tennis Supremacy Changes Hands: Perry Wins Wimbledon Title - Defeats Defending Champion Crawford in Straight Sets - First Englishman to Win the Championship in 25 Years - Reaches Finals in Both Men's and Women's Doubles</h3>
<p>(London, 6th) Britain's Perry defeated Australia's Crawford in straight sets today to win the Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship. The scores were 6-3, 6-0, 7-5.</p>
<p>The last time an Englishman won Wimbledon was back in 1907. Now, after a gap of twenty-five years, Perry has won the championship again. Including the US and Australian championships he has already won, Perry is undoubtedly the current world amateur tennis champion. Most remarkably, he defeated Crawford in the finals of all three championships.</p>
<h3>Perry Wins Thirteen Games in a Row</h3>
<p>In the first set, Perry displayed extremely amazing tennis skills, defeating the champion Crawford easily. The match was completed in just sixty-five minutes. Crawford was initially very steady, taking a 3-1 lead in the first set. In an extremely astonishing state, Perry then won thirteen consecutive games, turning the tables to win the first set 6-3, the second set 6-0, and take a 1-0 lead in the third set. In the fourth game of the first set, when Perry was down 0-40 (0-3), he suddenly unleashed three unreturnable backhands, turning defeat into victory. The first set was completed in just twenty-five minutes.</p>
<h3>More Than Five Senses, He Has Six</h3>
<p>In the second set, Perry completely subdued Crawford. Beyond the five senses, he seemed to have a sixth sense, able to anticipate Crawford's every move, forcing him into layers upon layers of mistakes. Countless points were scored directly. The second set was completed in just ten minutes.</p>
<h3>Conclusion Amid Extreme Danger</h3>
<p>In the third set, each won a game, tying the score at 4-4. Until the ninth game, Crawford hit three deep lobs, taking a 5-4 lead. In extreme danger, Perry then won two consecutive games, turning the tables to take a 6-5 lead. In the next game, Crawford served, taking a 40-0 (3-0) lead. Perry leveled the score with an extremely brilliant return. Crawford then hit the ball out of bounds once. Crawford then served again, with immense power, but was judged to have committed a foot fault. Thus, Perry's victory opened in an atmosphere of tension.</p>
