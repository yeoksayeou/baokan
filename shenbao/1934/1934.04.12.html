<h3 id="c29">英在新加坡繼續築港說　恒 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>據日本報知新聞云。日本因英國在新加坡繼續築港。認爲足以威脅日本之安全。擬要求英國停止進行。否則於一九三五年海軍會議時。决意推翻英</p>
<p>美日海軍五五三之比例云云。日政府對於英國此舉究將進行何種事前之交涉尙不得而知。唯綜觀近頃國外電訊英美對於未來之海軍會議均主維持五五三之比例而英國之繼續建築新加坡軍港亦勢有必行當非交涉所能了事。</p>
<p>英於九一八後。對日態度迷離惝怳殊難捉摸自大體言之。則較美國爲消極。其意似欲藉美之勢以制日本不欲自露鋒芒致引起日本之敵意。然至美民主黨政府放棄菲島之意態明顯後英國對日之態度。亦由消極而趨向積極。如最近日印恊定限制日本棉織品之傾銷英國海軍預算之擴大皆可視爲態度轉變之表徵。礷而新加坡築港工程之繼續尤足見其對日戒備之嚴重蓋自日美間之緊張狀態漸次弛緩以後。向之可以藉爲牽製日本之勢力今已無可利用。則爲英國計。自非改取對日積極態度不可也。</p>
<p>更就英美兩國在遠東之利害言。亦英大而美小美若放棄菲律濱可無傷於其立國之命脈。英着放棄新加坡港所依附之海峽殖民地。則不列　帝國或恐隨而有瓦解之患其最顯然者。卽英領印度澳洲新西蘭皆將因此一海峽之放棄而陷入比較孤立無援之地位日本之優勢海軍足可加以壓迫而無所難故新加坡者。實爲英國防護印度之門戶。屏蔽澳洲之前衛英國大權在握不獨能塞日本海軍西進之途更能抑其南向之路。至若遠東貿易之保護。猶其餘事耳。故新加坡港。在軍事上商業上價値皆遠勝於直布羅陀與亞丁。日本爲應付起見。乃與暹羅政府商妥在暹羅加萊地峽開一運河以灌通印度洋與中國海。經費卽由日本貸予。於此可見英日兩國鈎心鬥角之一斑。</p>
<p>由我人觀之。英國此次對日態度之轉變。雖與我初無關係然其不利於日則殊爲明顯蓋英國此一舉動自消極方面言。固可謂出於自衛自積極方面言。則其意實欲於一九三五年之太平洋會議時。壓迫日本使之就範。則可推想而知也。</p>

<p>（日內瓦）本日軍縮會議主席團開會時一般形勢已誌前電、茲再將主席漢德森及各代表之演說詳誌如下、㈠漢德森主張於五月二十三日召集總委員會、旋謂各大國幾無一不增加軍事預算者、軍縮競爭重行開始、現仍繼續進行、若干部份輿論認時局已無希望、此輩人士對縮减軍備之意義已明白蔑視、意欲各國對於軍備各自爲政、而回復從前國際上混亂狀况、各挾堅甲利兵以相對峙、漢氏結論力勸各國誠意合作、本乎現存條約及以前業經决定之原則、訂立軍縮公約、俾新軍備競爭之潮流得以停止、而使逐日擴大之戰爭危險得以避免、㈡英國人表艾登主張主席團延至四月三十日開會、俾渠得熟察情形、再對總委員會確定重行開會一層表示意見、艾登謂法德兩國關於各種問題意見相參甚遠、例如關於軍額之計算、有殖民地軍隊·已訓練之後備軍隊、正式軍隊以外之軍事團體等、尙難取得同意、又如德國短期兵役軍隊、須經過一定試騐期間之後、始能配備防禦情</p>
<p>質之軍器、但此種試騐期間何時開始、其長短如何、皆爲尙難同意之點艾登鑒於種種困難、乃主張主席團延期開會、俾外交談判、得以繼續進行、㈢蘇俄代表斯泰因、繼漢德林及艾登之後起立演說、謂只須軍縮有世界性、則無論對於何種現存軍備之裁减、蘇俄無不樂於接受、所謂軍縮有世界性者、卽所有各國不加區别、一律實行裁軍是也、斯泰因以爲軍縮會議所應研究者、一爲蘇俄所提關於侵略國定義之建議、二爲法國所提關於安全之建議、三爲美國大總統所提關於不侵犯條約之建議、㈣法國代表馬西格里繼起發言、將一九三三年十月十四日德國退出軍縮會議以前軍縮會議所主張之主要原則重行叙述、謂目下又發生種種新事實、而德國要求在質與量上立卽重整軍縮之計畫、卽爲其最重要者、馬西格里謂、本年三月十三日德國致法國復文、一方要求允許德國立卽重整軍備、一方又要求他國縮減軍備、此種態度不免矛盾、馬西格里以爲德國之主張不啻將軍縮會議歷來討論之基礎根本推翻、如欲如此、必須召集總委員會、投標表决之、蓋軍縮會議工作、歷來所根據之原則、應否放棄、惟總委員會有權决定之也、馬西格里旋謂、德國實際上已從事重整軍備、故其要求之若干點與其軍備上之實際情形、究竟相差幾何、尙屬問題、法國代表繼稱、英國政府努力研究軍縮公約實施上保障問題、以求其日見光明、法國政府深爲感謝、渠深信不久可與倫敦同意得到解决辦法、馬西格里結論謂、法國政府必竭盡力量、使時局儘早得一總結束、以便報告於軍縮會議、㈤瑞典外長散特婁·瑞士代表摩達·及波蘭代表勒秦斯基相率發言、均希望能得到具體結果、散特婁特别主張三點、卽（甲）由實質上裁軍、（乙）酌量實行○軍縮平等權、（丙）設立新安全保障、摩達謂、渠以爲德國必須令其重回日內瓦、蓋無德國、則在精神上軍縮公約卽無法討論也、勒秦斯基則贊成法國代</p>

<p>借欵用途</p>
<p>首都電氣廠、戚墅堰電氣廠、及淮南礦務局、均係建設委員會直接經辦事業、規模雖不甚小、但以資金缺乏、周轉不靈、欲圖發展、亦屬困難、現向滬巿</p>

<p>國際問題研究會·及國際貿易恊會·於昨日下午五日、在香港路四號銀行俱樂部四樓、請國際貿易局長何炳賢演講、「國際貿易問題、」到兩會會員郭秉文·黎照寰·陳蔗靑·沈信卿·蔡無忌·顧季高·徐鳳石·劉士木·張祥麟·朱少屏·屠楚漁·等數十人、美國亞細亞叢刋編輯韋格氏、適來滬遊歷、亦被邀參與茶會、由黎照寰主席、茲分誌何氏演詞及討論情形如上、　　入超减少　保氏首謂、國際貿易問題、</p>
<p>範圍太大、非短時間內可講述、今略述去年進口出口貿易之分析、及研究國際貿易統計中發現之欵問、去年全國進出口貿易共十九萬萬五千餘萬、較前年（民國二十一年）减少百分之十九、進口總數爲十三萬萬餘兩、較前年减百分之十</p>
<p>八、出口總數爲六萬萬一千餘萬兩、較前年减百分之二十、但此項减少之比數、並不能作爲研究之根據、因前年上半年中包括東北各海關之進出口數在也、如將前年上半年度東北各關數字除去後比較、則去年入口較前年稍减、而出口則增多四千餘萬兩、比較上入超减少一萬萬餘兩、　　購買力弱　入超减少、驟視之固係好現象、然試一考其實際、則進口貨之减少、實係於我國農村破產、人民購買力薄弱所致、與我國增加進口稅、而出口貨仍多爲原料品、故並不足樂觀也、至貨物分類、進口最多者、首米麥棉花等農產品、次爲新工業品、輸出多爲絲茶桐油等、與數十年前並無稍變、</p>
<p>對日减少　分國别觀察、則入口美列第一·英列第二·日本第三·德國第四·輸出國别、則香港第一·美國第二·英日次之、與前數年輸入輸出、均以日本爲最大者不同、其原因固非一端、東北淪亡之影響、或其最大也、</p>
<p>統計困難　研究國際貿易、以海關統計爲最可確之根據、倘推而與他國統計相參照、在理應有同一結果、如我對彼爲入超、則彼對我必爲出超、但結果有出於意料外者、如中國對意對德對比歷年來均爲入超、而意德比三國貿易統計册上、則對華亦均爲入超、實爲怪事、其相歧之原因、或爲下一三點、一爲統計方法不同、如因轉口輸出、我國列入輸出口岸國家、而他國並不列入、或經過香港之貨物、彼作輸往香港、我則列入原輸出國、㈡貨價估計不同、㈢或尙漏稅輸入考、</p>
<p>今年觀察　何氏演講畢、郭秉文等均相繼發表意見、對如何平衡國際貿易、略作討論、後顧季高詢何氏以本年貿易之前途、如否有較佳之希望、何答稱、此次足以根據之材料、實不易搜集、其難作肯定之預測、惟個人私見、以爲銀價如再高漲、則出口貿易前途、殊未許樂觀耳、</p>
<p>顧氏意見　次白銀專家顧季高發表對入超問題意見、謂入超並非絶對不利於我、如日本英國均爲入超國、但並不因之而弱在產業落後之我國、倘國內物價不跌、則因利息較高、華僑及外人均樂於投資、使產業得逐步建設、而投資者、並非現金、卽爲入超之貨物、如是於我並無如何極不良之影響、故數十年來入超日增、然現金流出並不多、至民國十九年後、我國增加關稅、而增加者並非保護性質、而僅爲謀財政收入之增多、其後世界經濟恐慌接踵而至、致造成不良之貿易環境、近年來海關貿易册上、進口金額雖增、完全爲金貴滙率關係、實際上則我以巨量之農產口、易他國少數之貨品也、倘欲以人爲之力、强求貿易平衡、則必致農產品更低之價格、勉强巨量輸出、足更陷國民經濟於困難云、</p>

<p>招商局同華輪昨自汕頭返滬、行至浦江到金利源碼頭時、撞毁海關河筒燈船一艘、詳情如次、</p>
<p>途中有霧</p>
<p>招商局同華輪、上次由滬滿儎貨物赴汕頭、迨至由汕開還上海、因當地貨物、多爲太古怡和輪裝載同華僅七十五件、開還上海、不啻放空、船到浙江洋面、遇有重霧、船主姜長慶航行甚爲把穏、因放空遠航、不敢冒險、故在白節門洋面抛停避霧、歷一日一夜、及至霧散後開行、因之航程遲誤一天、至昨晨始到上海、</p>
<p>進口停泊</p>
<p>昨日、同華輪進口、該局爲老　聯運貨擁擠待運、故令其至南巿金利源碼頭靠泊、以備裝載貨件、同華駛進</p>
<p>浦江、直放南棧、輕儎急水、船主早令慢車前進、同華行至將近新江天碼頭前江面、照例船身掉頭、其時車已停駛、待掉正輪體、卽在金利源碼</p>
<p>頭上靠停、</p>
<p>燈船未開</p>
<p>浦江內各段河筒、夜間江海關例派燈船一艘、駐在河筒、懸燈示警、至早晨天明時、該燈船例須撤退、同華到第五號河筒前、（卽新江天開船河筒）業已天明、而河筒上海關燈船、猶未離開、其時同華船到、急欲轉身、潮水又激、該燈船妨碍掉頭、乃由同華船員高聲喝令速開、以免釀禍、</p>
<p>船體撞毁</p>
<p>其時燈船上共有三人、對同華開到、知照其砍斷繩索、速卽離開、燈船之人未加注意、同華車未開動、乘潮勢轉身、該燈船不早避讓、致遭碰撞、其船尾立向江內下沉、在燈船內三人、幸扳援河筒、得未落</p>
<p>水、惟燈船已經毁壞、幸同華急切避退、否則五號河筒、亦將受其妨碍而衝毁也、</p>
<p>渡輪拖去</p>
<p>海關燈船撞毁後、後經東門路巿輪渡渡輪到來、將撞毁燈船、設法拖往南巿、一面報告海關、同華於停船後、亦由船主姜長慶到總局、將海關燈船碍航及被撞毁壞情事、詳細報告船務科、</p>

<h3 id="c182">研究國際問題的又一舉例㈡ <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>分析國際政治不僅，要顧到國際間某一階段的基本對立。，不僅要顧到某一國度的矛盾的消長，而且最重要的還不能忘記資本主義以外的另一不同制度的國度內的一切變動。譬如我們要理解帝國主義反蘇戰爭日趨緊迫的意義，我們不應僅從資本主義與社會主義不能調和這一抽象的命題上去理解，我們卻要具體的從蘇聯經濟建設的巨大勝利，　新政治體系所表現的大衆的德謨克拉西，及大衆物質生活水凖飛速的向上，新與文化之飛躍這些方面所給與資本主義體系的影響上去考察。我們方纔明白帝國主義者反蘇不是反抽象的社會主義，而是反已在實行並且已獲勝利的社會主義國度，而這怪物的存在，壯大，無形的是對資本主義的一種威脅。這非獨在分析今日之國際上所不能忽視的主要點，卽小而至於分析一國之政治，也不能放過這一方面所給僣的影響。又譬如，日蘇關係，緊張是萬分緊張了，但日本也還不敢輕於嘗試。若要理解這種關係，一方面雖然我們可說日蘇關係的緊張是由於蘇聯經濟建設的成功上去觀察，但同時也要知道日本不敢輕於嘗試的原因，卻也正是由於蘇聯經濟建設的成功所致。看來好似矛盾，其實是很自然的。</p>
<p>國際問题就是這般簡單麽？不！决不！以上不過從各方面略爲加以考察罷了。如果一個觀察者只注意到某一方面，而忽視其他方面，他自然只能成一個形式主義者，只看見樹木，不曾見着森林。如果一個觀察者僅把握住了某一階段　成國際關係主要骨幹，而忽視具體的發展的事實，他一定會將一切問題看得空空洞洞，不能把握它的特殊性，他所作出的結論，只會是些抽象的原則，變成公式主義，背誦公式，它會失去時間性，只要大體未變，差不多任保時間都可應用。這類觀察者雖然較前者要進步些，實則仍是絲毫没有用處，最多也不過是一個機械論者，將一切動的事態機械化了罷了　　一個科學的觀察者，他不僅要正確的把握以上所提示的各方面，他還要從各方面，或各過程，活潑潑的動態中，去綜合每一歷史階段的形勢，指出每一歷史階段的特殊性，指出每一歷史階段上所發生的每一件事的本質，因爲，現在國際間每一問題的發生，都不是出於一個簡單的因素，而是被織在無數經緯交錯的網面上。一個科學的觀察者，自不應僅說些空洞的原則上的話就算了事，他應具體的分析事實的發生，剖白其眞實並指出發展的前途。</p>
<p>現在要回到趙君所提出的問題上來了。趙君說··「國際風雲，瞬倐萬變」，這是千眞萬確的，接着趙君又說··「眞是令人不可捉摸」，這句話是不大對的，國際問題雖甚複雜，雖變得很快，其實，只要細心觀察仍是「可捉摸」的，趙君對谥日美妥恊的認識也完全是戴的形式論理的眼鏡，所以對於許多評論家的意見不能指出他們的缺點，只看作是矛盾，是有意味「哄騙」他的。</p>
<p>我們不能否認「日美在遠東的利害不能相共」在太平洋上必出一戰」這些話的眞實，同時我們也一樣認「英美的經濟關係還比日美來得嚴重」這話的不錯。不過，這些話都只是研究日美英美關係中，主要的原則。日美妥恊這一當前事件的認識，固然不應離開這主要原則去理解，但我們不應僅背出這些原則上的話就算答覆了這一問題。趙君的不滿意目下的時論大抵卽由於此。現在且就「日美妥恊」，來提示趙君一點研究的途徑罷！</p>
<p>日美妥恊旣然不能像趙君來信所說的那般簡單，那末，實的發生將基礎應如何去理解呢？我們第一要從英美，英日及日美三方面去考察。英美的關係中包含有。　「經濟全面性的對立的矛盾」；但最近國際事件並無激化他們轉入新的鬥爭塲面。英日的關係，最近從貿易的競爭上現出的是露骨的外交戰，彼此到了互不相讓的階段了，日美的關係雖然在太平洋上實在不能調和，但因兩國經濟的結構的表面上並無多大冲突，單就兩國貿易而言，到還是彼此很好，多年的老主顧。他們的不和是在資本主義本身的矛盾及今後兩國發展上產出的，所以倘若其他方面有了變動，日美一時妥恊卽具有可能性。最近國際關係自然以世界經濟大恐慌爲其背影，恐慌使着英美處處不能不感到敵愾；恐慌使英日放棄了舊日同盟的餘情，轉而張目不能相讓了，恐慌使日美在太平洋的對立激化；但同時又促成了日本放棄英國轉而向美讓步條件，美亦以本國復興失敗，世界形勢日非，戰爭的凖備又還未有完全的把握，在戰爭的組織</p>
<p>過程中，美國的商人心中，不免想到「我們同日本商業上並無不快啊！他們旣然同我們講和，我們何妨來敷衍他一回呢？哈哈，這同時是拆開了英日舊好，這是對英的一種威脅啊！」（未完）</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>聖駕東行的旨意雖然是已經决定了，但是在啓行之前，儘有許多的事情須得凖備咧。第一步必須讓太后下一條正式的上諭，指定伊的專車將於何日自北京開回奉天。同時，還得添製一條新的法律，就是凡在太后的專車在路上行駛的時候，全路的無論那一段，都不准再有旁的車輛移動，違者處以極刑。當然，這一次京奉鐵路上的長官，都不免被派爲基本　從人員了。此外，太后又得隨意挑出幾個重要的廷臣來同行。至於其他的一切籌備工作，便由我和大將軍慶善負責處理，這裏也不及細寫。</p>
<p>籌備工作一開始，鐵路工人便首先忙碌起來了。因爲據我們的估計，要裝載全部的官員，宫監，宫女，以及各種用具，材料等等，這一列御用專車，就非得掛上十六輛車不辦。同時又因爲這些車輛在購到以後，還從不曾行駛過</p>
<p>，爲愼重起見，少不得先要施行一番檢查；這一部份的工作，居然是很迅速地辦妥了。其次就是要把十六輛車子完全改漆代表皇族的黃色。能夠保持本來的面目的，只有那一輛機關車。我想皇太后如果想到了這一點的話，伊是决不肯讓這輛機關車不换顔色的。</p>
<p>這是多麽可惜啊！我們竟不能有一輛黃色的機關車，拖着我們，在中華的原野裏往來馳驟，使我至今還覺得不勝抱憾！</p>
<p>皇太后雖然是决意要出京了，但是還得照例的敎朝中的</p>
<p>各位大臣對於這件事發表一些意見。每逢有什麽比較重要一些的事情發生的時候，伊總是要　詢他們一番的。（九）</p>

<p>— 恂子</p>
<p>新生活運動，自經各方面盡力提倡，近已『甚囂塵上』。</p>
<p>所謂新生活，是恢復中國固有的舊德，禮義廉恥；而使生活整齊，清潔，儉樸。　　黃包車夫，被印度巡捕撬了照會去，便在通衢大道之間，下跪，向着那印度巡捕，叩頭如搗蒜，口口聲聲呌巡捕老爺；我們在旁邊瞧見了，不覺得那黃包車夫媚外，無恥；但覺那黃包車夫爲生活所壓迫，可憫！</p>
<p>再看一看閘北空地上的許多江北草棚，平常出入是要傴樓着身體的，一下雨雪，人簡直便如蜷伏在汚泥裏；這種生活，無疑地是不覔整齊清潔的條件；然而要除掉這上海主會的汚點，還須爲草</p>
<p>棚裏的人們策善後，斷不是放一把火，燒個精光，所能了事。</p>
<p>所以禮義廉恥的基礎，是建築在『豐衣足食』上的；無衣無食，如保能實以習禮，守義，養廉，明恥；你埋怨他們衣服不整齊飲食不清潔，他們乾脆地回答你一句話，便是『没有錢』三字！古人講一個『儉而中禮』，在水平綫下生活的人們，窮困是眞的，談不到儉樸。</p>
<p>希望蔣委員長和其他提倡新生活運動的諸公，從國民生計上着眼，然後改善生活，便不成問題！</p>

<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>散會了，人聲很嘈雜。我隨着一片人潮擠出國立「音專」的音樂會，耳畔仍在嗡嗡作響；似乎還留有「茶花女飲酒曲」的餘音。</p>
<p>時已深晚，風很緊，天正下着雨。街燈是失神般的淡綠，遠處幾株未成年的松楸，像似誰在蹲着瑟瑟地打顫；茶花女不會在這時出現吧！我心裏想。</p>
<p>淋着雨奔回寢室，解衣便睡。但耳畔老是不清不靜地在作怪，怎麽也睡不着</p>
<p>。不好！要不是茶花女竟找到了我！你聽！這是什麽聲響！瞎！伊怎麽又會到這裏來「弔嗓子」呢！</p>
<p>這是個東方色彩的老晴天，大家及時行樂罷！嚇！若要有了這明媚風光才行樂，那又是糊塗絶頂太可憐！我們是什麽孝不提，只要大家舒舒服服笑嘻嘻，也不管天光好不好，只要是笑眼瞧着酒杯中，杯中的笑眼相𢌞瞧。天公造酒又造愛，爲的是天公地母常相愛。人家說我們處世太湖塗，算了吧！要不糊塗又怎麽？你們愛怎麽說就怎麽說，我們愛怎麽做就怎麽做。你便是一個最厲害的檢察官，請你來瞧一瞧我們酒杯吧！嚇！保你馬上的心回意轉，意滿心歡。</p>
<p>有人說我在「見鬼」，在裝糊塗。算了罷！要不糊塗又怎麽！</p>
<p>可是話又得說回來啦，劉半農先生這篇譯作，眞是再没有酷肖「現在」一般中國人的性格的了！劉先生纔不愧是個「先知先覺」的「中國人」哩！</p>

<p>不道凳子脚，正好絆住了他的大腿，人向前一栽幾乎是躺平了下去。若不是他懂得幾下把式，趕快將手</p>
<p>扶了牆壁，這一下恐怕還是摔得不輕。桂枝心上，正揑着一把汗呢，趙翁倒是不慌不忙，挺立了起來，笑道··没事</p>
<p>，我自已還有兩手。說着話，他自己走回房去拿着三個鷄蛋到廚房裏去了。桂枝看了這種情形，實在不安。但是自己已經撒過謊了，又不便說眼睛並不害病，只笑道··老爺子，您歇着罷，這可招罪死了，我怎敢要您張羅呢？趙翁那裏肯聽，直等着小林把鷄蛋煮着送來了，這才吃飯。桂枝口裏吃着鷄蛋，心想，老爺子是一番誠心，自己可是一番假意，細說起來，可對不住人了。因之吃過了飯，不敢裝病，也同着小林來收碗。趙翁連連搖着手道··你這是何必呢？論勤儉，也不在乎一天兩天的，你去趟着罷。我有事，還要上街去一躺呢。桂枝說是不要緊的，聽趙翁自去。不多大一會兒功夫，趙翁提着一個紙包就回來了。見桂枝在堂屋裏坐着，老遠的就將紙包伸了出來，向他笑道··</p>
<p>這是杭菊花，你拿去沏壺水喝，眼睛上火了，喝一壺就好的。桂枝笑道··倒要您這樣費心。趙翁並没有答話，又伸</p>
<p>着手到懷裏去摸索着，摸索了許久，摸出一隻小瓷瓶子來，兩個指頭钳着，放到桂枝手裏來，笑道··這是定州眼藥，點上就好，你就拿去點上罷。桂枝不料公公吃完飯怱怱忙忙走去，原來是爲自己買藥去了這個老人家待人，一切是仁愛忠厚，不帶點别的意味，讓人怎樣的不感激。當時連聲道謝，將眼藥和菊花都拿到屋子裏去了。（三六０）</p>

<p>— 影</p>
<p>女人的服裝，當然在不停的變幻，不要說服裝，就是頭髮也在不停的變幻之中，自去年的秋天起，世界上最時髦的女人。又乘着自然的棕色而不加改飾了。的確，從巴黎傳來的消息，已在淘汰白金色的淺黃，一般的人，都承認這種色彩行得太久了，在美丨丨用白金洗髮的地方丨丨首先感到不時行了，紐約一般的女人，甚至自四月起，還在使全美的婦女，以頭部表現金黃色爲標凖，百老匯的意見同時却起了「讓頭髮自然而長垂」的口號。</p>
<p>倫敦，我們如果比較一下，像那西部的第一流理髮師却對人這樣說··「女人來理髮，每是照各人所喜的，伊們現在却都說不再喜歡短頭髮，因爲要留起來垂到後面的頭頸這樣才可捲起來，這種捲髮是很輕的，否則伊們便要嫌重了。但因爲要把頭髮捲起唯一的方法，祇有把短頭髮留長呢！因此在倫敦，現在短頭髮將要不時了。」</p>
<p>現在，很少的女人，再要用白金色洗髮，像以前一樣，伊們喜歡這樣洗髮的，就是其他顔色，也不歡喜用了。否則，在理髮店中，要費去好多的時光。女人要反頭髮留長，就是很長了，也不必剪，因爲伊們時常戴了帽子出去，頭髮愈長，可把帽子放大的。</p>

<h3 id="c190">放風箏的玩意 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>放風箏的利益</p>
<p>到了春天，最時髦的一種玩意，當然是放風箏了，放風箏不要說成人，就是孩子們也誰都會放，而且不含賭博性，比什麽玩意都高尙，放風箏的孩子們在野外奔跑，跳躍，可增進活潑，而精神興奮，加之野外的空氣新鮮，風景優美，都可使孩子們發生快感，而且祇要有了麻綫，風箏，一次，兩次，無數次的可放，不必再化錢，是最經濟的玩意，莫怪這次國府要人，提倡放風箏呢！</p>
<p>風箏的製法</p>
<p>紥製風箏的原料，祇須彩紙，竹子，漿糊，線，在上海，出賣風箏的店家，價錢很貴，其實祇消自己紥製，用竹子紥成了骨，湖上彩紙，便成了，簡單的，六</p>
<p>角，八角，九串，人人會紥，複雜的蝴蝶，蜈蚣，精巧的人也會紥，不要費多少錢，不過紥</p>
<p>好了鬚要生得凖，不凖就放不高。風箏紥得上下大小相同，便要用鷂尾，風愈大，鷂尾愈多，但部大一些，就可不用鷂尾。</p>
<p>鷂燈的架法</p>
<p>放風箏另外還有各種玩意，先說鷂燈，到了晚上，便可架鷂燈了。五彩的紙燈，上面要遮鉛皮</p>
<p>，防風吹熄，下面結塊小磚，防風吹蕩，這樣可架在風箏的線上，距離要一律，下面看上去才整齊，燈的盞數多少，要看風箏的大小而定，多架了風箏要吃不消而跌落，在上海有的人生了電線，架紅綠電燈，但輕重也要量力而行呢！</p>
<p>弓形的鷂琴</p>
<p>鷂琴是用一根竹子，一片篾或絲帶做的，竹子鷂得像弓一樣，篾或絲帶作了弓絃，有的架在風箏上，有的架在線上，但角度都要對凖風向，否則便不響。風箏</p>
<p>上架了鷂琴，隨風波動而發出起伏的琴聲，在在空中抑揚高下，老遠可使你聽見。</p>
<p>火藥做的散沙</p>
<p>用一條綿紙做成一個管子，把火藥，炭屑，研細了放在裏面，紥緊了一頭和線結在鷂線上，一頭紥一根藥線，點了火把鷂線放出去，等到藥線着了火藥，炭屑，天空中便會散下一天火星，好像倒放花筒一樣。在晚上，是一種很有趣的玩意，但下面如果有草屋，那便要謹愼一些，怕會釀成火患，所以這種玩意，祇可在荒野的空塲中嘗試。</p>
<p>其他的種種</p>
<p>上海已說了幾種風箏上的玩意之玩意，但此外還有幾種像放疊鷂丨風箏上放風箏丨用紅綠紙紥了風車，架在鷂線上，結一串鞭砲，點着了，結在線上，放上天空，劈劈拍拍······都是很有趣的玩意兒呢！</p>

<p>十五比十一</p>
<p>中華４５十五比十分美國２１</p>
<p>十五比０分</p>
<p>先敗後勝　美國隊雖兇、但在中華選手雷霆萬鈞之殺球下、毫無生路、中華以個人技術之平均、無論殺球救球、無不擅長、使觀者歎觀止焉、惟時露荒張、往往大意失分、開始卽負</p>
<p>四分、陣容殊見凌亂、往後極力振作、打成六比六、而七比七、然後反敗爲勝、成十比七、中華以十四比十一佔先時、相持劇烈、各難獲分、然中華卒以十五比十一獲勝焉、</p>

<h3 id="c203">京巿敎育應行改進要點 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>敎部督學之報告</p>
<p>敎部前次派員視察南京巿敎育視察結果、業經呈報敎部、該項報告對於京巿敎育、應行改進之意見、茲探悉於左、</p>
<p>㈠查該巿義務小學尙能注意擴充、惟各校設備類多簡單、敎學方法亦多呆板、均應設法改善、並由局指定辦理較良之義務小學、於相當期內將辦理經過畢業生成績及一切困難問題、編成報告、報部察核、或指定設備完、由辦理較優之小學、試辦義務小學及二部全日制、觀其成績如</p>
<p>何、而謀推廣同時應再盡力擴充小學、使全巿學齡兒童、均有就學之機會、</p>
<p>㈡該巿小學校舍、類多簡陋、不甚適用、對於敎育設施兒童安全均有影響亟應由局切實、籌劃改善方法、</p>
<p>㈢查近年以來該由小學多有實行體罰、以濟敎育方法之窮、惟其影響所及、究屬不良、亟應剴切曉示各校避用體罰、採用其他適當之糾正方法、以防流弊、</p>
<p>㈣該巿小學之課室桌椅、均由局發給、樣式頗多未合質料亦欠堅實往往使用不久、卽須修理、殊不經濟、應設法改良、</p>
<p>㈤公私立中學之敎學設備、除安徽中學之生物與圖書、鍾英中學及中大實校之理化、金陵女中之圖書、匯文女中之家事巿立一中之圖畫勞作、尙有相當設備外、餘多簡陋、敎學方法不特對於語言及社會科學科目、多趨重講演注入、卽自然學科亦缺乏適當自動與實騐工作、一般敎員鮮見充分敎學研究精神應卽分别設法充實及改進㈥私立中學每班學生人數、往往達七八十人、殊與敎管有礙、且徵收費用、超過規定限度甚鉅、均應嚴予限制、以增進敎育效能、減輕學生負擔㈦靑年指導爲中學敎育之急務、該巿各校除巿立一中·中華女中·尙有相當設施外、其餘多未注意、他如各校訓育責任、仍多由一二訓育人員負責、敎員均置不問、亟應遵照部頒中小學升學及職業指導辦法及中學規程關於訓敎合一之規定、切實施行、</p>
<p>㈧勞作敎育之目的在從實際活動中獲得眞實技能與經騐、並養成靑年勸勞習慣、自應切實辦理、該巿各校除中大實校巿立一中、匯文女中、注意及此外、頗多因循敷衍、旣無塲所又無工具、多以簡易之籐工、鐵絲工、爲其唯一工作、甚有並此科目面不設、如鍾南中學者、亟應分别轉飭改進、</p>
<p>㈨該巿私立中學數量甚多、其中辦理尙有成績之數校、應自廿三年度起、由局詳加考核、酌量</p>
<p>設法補助、以資奬勵、</p>
<p>㈩私立中學經濟能力有限、欲其卽行改辦職業學校、事實上尙有困難、應由局斟酌各校情形、令其試辦職業科、職業補習班、或改辦小學、並由局擇優補助、以資奬勵、</p>
<p>㈩㈠私立學校於呈請立案之前、尙能努力設施、以求進步一經核准、則多漸趨鬆懈、故未立案者、固應嚴加取締、已立案者尤應隨時認眞考核督促、以符現定之標凖、</p>
<p>㈩㈡敎育視察重在指導、據該巿學校當局聲稱、「社會局督學每學期視察學校一次、但視察時旣多未發表意見視察復亦少指導改進之報告」、嗣复亟應注意、</p>
<p>㈩㈢私立南京美術專科學校、尙未辦理立案手續、業已令行該局轉飭遵辦、查該校校舍簡陋、甚不合用、設備經費、亦欠充實、應由該局飭令設法充實、內容增籌經費改建校舍、並促其迅速辦理立案手續、以憑核奪、</p>

<p>㈢普通軍事訓練自中學以上、均厲行極嚴格之軍事訓練、敎官由陸軍部直委、學生對敎官絶對服從、畏之如虎、學生受軍訓不力者、敎官可任意鞭撻、各校均有眞槍操演、實彈射擊、</p>
<p>野外實習、夜間演習等、學生平時均着制服、帶制帽、男生不許留髮、見師長行軍禮、一切生活如軍人、學校以外之靑年在十六歲以上二十五歲以下者、則由靑年訓練所於夜間施以嚴格之</p>
<p>軍事職業及公民訓練、全國共有靑年訓練所近二萬處、多利用中小學校舍爲之、此外有靑年團少年團之組織、在國家有事時、亦帶有軍事意味、日本如此普遍注重軍訓、一旦有事、舉國皆兵在東京所見之清國神社、保塜所見之少國民展覽會、國防展覽會、來鄕史蹟展會等、其所陳列之各種近代戰具、科學武器、各國軍力比較、日本對外戰爭之光榮歷史、及戰利品、與夫武人衛國之豐功偉烈、在在無不鼓勵其國民研究戰爭、凖備國防、參加向外侵略、實令人驚心動魄、吾國學校、近多設軍訓一科、然往往敷衍從事、敎官不能指揮、學生不知服從、行之多年、鮮有效果之可言、至一般社會則麻木不仁、更不知大難之將臨、國防爲何事、吾政府其速訂軍役軍訓統制辦法、國民亦應認清責任之所在、局勢之險惡、急起作軍事之鍜鍊、與國防之凖備也、</p>
<p>㈣培養勤勞習慣日本女子素以勤勞著稱於世、女學校中、無不着重家事、如學生實習用之縫紉烹調洗染園藝家庭經濟衛生諸設備、自小學以至大學、無不應有盡有、督課學生、亦至嚴格、正課之外、舉凡日常生活、如炊事·洒掃·以及一切學校整理雜務、均由學生輪値、地板一塵不染、玻璃透明如鏡、吾等所至之女校、多不用僕役、而由學生躬自處理一切、反觀吾國女校之製造雙料小姊者、眞不知相去幾何矣、至男學校中、洒掃諸務、亦多由學生爲之、中學之有學生千餘人者、往往祗用校工五六人、至多亦不過十人、其鍜鍊靑年勤勞習慣有如此者、吾國守會習慣、懶惰爲最大毛病、而敎育亦誤入造成養尊處優靑年之一途、欲治此病、非於學校中盡力提倡勤勞不可、此應效法於彼邦者也、</p>
<p>㈤提倡生產敎育各級學校中、各科敎材、</p>
<p>無不注重國家之富源、經濟之發展、農工之知識技能、以增進生產之方法、全國職業學校、則更授以生產之知識技能、吾等所至之五年制中學工科、已能製造極精緻之機器·電機·鐘表·理化彝器·無綫電泡·化裝品·上等家具·染織綢布·西式彫刻建築等、凡精緻工匠能製之物品、此類學校學生無不能爲之、各級職校畢業生、頗爲社會歡迎、供不應求、尤以自營工塲農塲者爲多、大學及專門除設職業科外、並設有職業敎員養成所、至爲一般祉會民衆增進生活技能者、則於各實業學校中附設補習夜校、日本職業敎育一方面以解决民生、增進生產、充裕國力爲務、一方面則令學生向外發展、製造貨物推銷於國外巿塲、尤以我國爲重要目的地、如京都工業學校所染織之布爲吾國人通用之花洋布、所製之電燈泡、爲吾國各地通用之二百伏打長形電燈泡、明白標示、以爲華人所需用、學生應努力學習製造推銷者也、吾人參觀之餘、不禁毛骨悚然、吾國近來各方多提倡職業敎育、或生活敎育、然多未注意社會之需要、設備之充實、與夫師資之培養、此應審愼者也、（未完）</p>

<p>— 天然</p>
<p>在這外貨傾銷日貨猖獗的時代，最不幸的消息，便是一個月來國貨工廠的工潮迭起，爲外貨日貨造暢銷的機會，眞是最痛心。可是政府方面，眼看這種情形，等於隔岸觀火，敷衍又敷衍，結果是愈弄愈糟，勢必把許多工廠關門停業而後已。，這是多麽傷心的事。在這無可奈何之時，忽然看到蔣委員長的一道通令，切實的主張消滅勞資糾紛，充實生產能力，於工人無故罷工時，得由主管署勒令解散工會，以速解决，惟各廠主亦不准虐待工人云云。這種乾乾脆脆的命令，確是保護生產事業，解决勢資糾紛扼要的途徑。苟各省巿政府當局，果能深體蔣委員長的意思，來嚴厲執行，設法取締，使辦理工廠的可以安心治業，使纔有萌芽的國貨事業，可以徐徐發展，足與外貨日貨抗衡。否則一綫生機，亦屬無望，我中國遲早必爲外商日商覇佔的巿塲。中華國貨產銷合作恊會，昨發擁護蔣委員長保護生產的通令，有「工潮迭起，言之痛心，每有事因極微本可卽行轉圖，徒以背後鼓煽之有人，動輙牽累月日，究其癥結，每一工潮，胥有少數操縱要脅者主持其間，以無識工人，羣衆供其利用，卒被兩敗俱傷，廠旣無以支持，工友亦失依託，使未來之有志企業者，視設廠爲畏途，不敢貿然嘗試。」這許多沈痛深切的話，一般操縱要脅居中播弄的分子，天良果在，不願爲國貨的大罪人，也應幡然覺悟，轉移鼓煽的伎倆，共來維持可憐的工人生計扶植垂危的國貨工業。或者中國的國貨工廠，尙有存在的地位。一般人人不致流爲餓殍。而主持行政的，對此繼續不斷的工潮，也該用快刀斬亂麻的辦法，早早解决，以維持地方僅有的元氣，工人生活的機會，這是記者垂涕而道，敢爲國貨界所韾香求禱的。</p>

<h3 id="c216">談談時事 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>我所要談的時事，就是現在雷厲風行的··「摩登破壞團」，他們是專門以消毁摩登服裝爲目的的，他們的破壞武器，據說就是··「灑鏹水」,這一個迅雷不及掩耳的手段，固足以震驚一般喜欲摩登的靑年男女！</p>
<p>不过，我細想，他們不合邏輯的地方正多呢！一，摩登二字，是否合理？二，他們的執行者，是否有鑒别是否國貨的能力。三，對於灑鏹水是否合理？四，鏹水是否國貨？現在再來所四項來說一說，一，「摩登」就是「現代」，合乎現代化，是很合潮流的事，却未可厚非，二，現代化的呢絨綢緞衣料，中國貨的極多極多，就是内行的人，恐怕也難一時鑒别，我想激於一時義憤的他們，當然也没有十分鑒别的能力吧！倘然在他們心目之中認爲是摩登而非國貨就施以破壞，而那人倒是道道地地垢國貨呢絨或綢緞製成的服裝，豈不是受了寃枉而遭無妄之災嗎？三，據說鏹水不但能消毁衣物，而且還能侵蝕肌膚，那麽就算他們的衣服，是摩登的洋貨的，而他們的身體的無端受着損害，不是太不人道了嗎？四，據說中國貨的鏹水還没出咧丨那麽已經違背了··「提倡國貨」的信條了。</p>
<p>我以爲與其消極的破壞，不如積極的建設，如何建設呢？我將一得之愚，貢獻出來··無論各鄕各鎭，都可舉辦一個「服用國貨會」他們的責任，就是「勤人服用國貨」，先從每一個會員的家庭起，這樣的及於親友，再由親友之親友，傳播開來，漸漸的及於窮鄕僻壤之間，都有「服用國貨會」，這樣，不是用不到消極破壞了嗎？丨據中華國貨產銷合作恊會的計劃，不出數年，在國內到處可以見到中國國貨公司，也就是中國人到處可以買到中國貨了。</p>
<p>還有，這樣地破壞人家的摩登服裝，有觸犯刑法的危險，那無怪汪院長要明令嚴行禁止呢！</p>
<h3 id="c217">談摩登破壞團 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>洋貨進口，雖然年有增加，但是牠的消路，完全是在大都巿中，並且牠的主顧，也完全是那些知識界中的人。你看西裝革履的摩登男士，　髮蓬松的摩登女士，他們的頭上，身上，足上，那一件不是洋貨？但是，他們不是有知識的嗎？爲什麽這樣不愛國呢？唉！說來也是可憐！他們是深深的中了摩登的毒啊！他們以爲不這樣，就不能稱爲摩登。摩登摩登，你眞是害人不淺！</p>
<p>據報紙上登載着杭州專电，謂『杭州巿上發現摩登破壞團，連晚在各游藝塲所出現。西裝及婦女之洋貨大衣，均遭剪裂，波及者達千餘人』。這實在是一件令人痛快的事，對待這些只知摩登，不知愛國的人們，惟有用這種手段去對付她們。不过在法律上講，恐怕又是犯法的。所以這一種手段，只能取快一時，究竟不可爲訓。我以爲最好刻幾個烏龜印，凡是穿着洋貨的人，就給他蓋上一個。並且用洗不掉的油。印在上面，使他們無法再着。這樣，對於提倡國貨，或者還能收些效力，比較那只喊提倡，而不實行的好多了。讀者諸君，以爲可如？</p>
<p>家庭訪問記</p>
<h3 id="c218">蔡子孑民夫人 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 兪洽成</p>
<p>記得當那下雪的冬天早晨，我曾爲着靑年修</p>
<p>養問題去訪过蔡孑民先生</p>
<p>；現在，又逢着春寒料峭的下午去訪問蔡夫人。本來，今年這婦女國貨年中</p>
<p>，蔡夫人周峻女士對於國貨問題早有許多意見在會議席上發表过；然而，我們爲要介紹每一個從事提倡國貨運動的婦女界領袖，更要介紹各個人在這工作过程中對於工作的意見，所以，我終於往滬西去晋謁。</p>
<p>客室裏是非常幽靜的，而且簡樸的佈置中，含有一種美的意味。窗前和地上，散佈着幾件在開</p>
<p>放的盆景，壁上是幾幅油畫伴着六尺的蔡先生畫像，春餘祇有吳稚暉先生的五言篆字對聯一付。這裏所給吾人的印象，并不是大紅大綠的俗氣，而是另外一種雅緻。</p>
<p>蔡夫人走進來的時候，身上穿着國產布製的衣服，態度是持重的，講話果斷而有力。</p>
<p>劈口我們就談到上海巿婦女國貨會，那已經是好多年前的組織，參加的份子都是智識份子的家庭主婦，目前雖然會員有多人已往外埠，可是蔡夫人和潘夫人李浩然夫人沈夫人等，現在仍是繼續努力的進行。這會是國貨年和婦女國貨年以前組織的，規定的公約很嚴，但是，蔡夫人是始終遵守着。　　當我問到婦女國貨年要如何才可以完成她的偉大使命時，蔡夫人的答覆是··「除去由婦女界努力提倡以外，有許多關係全局的，更需要由國家與社會輔助進行！」</p>
<p>「因爲愛好便宜是人們的天性，根本的辦法應由政府提高舶來品的賦稅，同時减輕國内土產的轉口稅，這樣，比嘴邊的提倡國貨的效率好的多！「　　同時，爲補足以上的理由，她含有悲憤的說道··「現在的東洋貨竟比國貨便宜！」</p>
<p>關於婦女國貨年的工作，蔡夫人是主張採用勸導方式的，目前的勸導祇能及到比較接近的一部份，推廣的方法應該着重到婦女團體和女學校去活動，譬如一校有一百個女生</p>
<p>，完全接受贊同的時候，各個人可轉勸她自己的家庭，實在的功效等於勸導过一百家。當時，她又談</p>
<p>到向工廠内女工去活動，然而，事實告訴我們，因爲經濟的關係，推銷洋貨的多是智識階級所謂上等人，所以她主張今後我們應有··「用外國貨是可恥，用國貨雖不美視而可敬的」一種觀念，建設起這樣的大衆心理！</p>
<p>最後，蔡夫人總括她的意見··㈠希望政府提高舶來品的關稅，在經濟方</p>
<p>面從事實際的提倡國貨，㈡希望工商界將國貨和舶來品分别調查清楚，使從事提倡的人，有一可靠的參考；㈢另一外面，婦女國貨年由婦女們努力去幹這。樣，才有獲得成功的可能！</p>
<p>先生可要來路貨的　戒到合間去問問看！</p>

<h3 id="c219">新生活制服與國貨 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 錢醉竹</p>
<p>新生活運動發生到現在，始終不过一個月，蓬蓬勃勃的氣象，已瀰漫到全國，牠的進行，也漸漸由言論而見之事實了。</p>
<p>從衣食住行上，規定新生活的公約，也在報上見到。假使能依此實行，那麽短時間内，便能煥然改觀，收移風易俗之效。</p>
<p>不过還有一事，似乎還没人提起；而其實是很需要的，便是··</p>
<p>「從事新生活的人，應當有一種表幟丨服裝」</p>
<p>「城中好高髻，四方高一尺」這確然是「上有好者下必有甚焉」的鐵證；但好高髻的人，倘若是僅僅「好在心裏」，而不「梳一個高髻」來給人看，好麽，短時間内，决不會有「四方高一尺」的大效吧。</p>
<p>假定；我們把「國料中山裝」來作從事新生活運動人們的制服，那麽，至少有下面的幾種好處。</p>
<p>一，穿了制服，隨時要檢束自己行動，引起自尊心；至少，不敢浪漫，汚濁，輕薄，因爲受人注目的緣故。</p>
<p>二，示範他人，引起社會的敬仰心，而思則效，改革。至少，使不穿制服的人，（卽不作新生活的人）内心上生一種愧恧，反省。</p>
<p>三，國貨可以暢銷，因爲處處有制服牽制他的行動，提撕他的良心。至少，國布國綢可以盛行，外貨可以不買。　　四，整潔簡樸的精神，可以充分在制服上表現出來；可以互相監視其言行，是否是「實行新生活」者；可以使社會上觀感一新，使新生活運動，推進的更快。</p>
<p>假使不規定「新生活的人須穿制服」的話，那麽上面所說的好處，便是害處。舉例來說，上面第一項，變了··</p>
<p>「不穿制服，不必檢束手心，不會引起自尊心，照舊可以浪漫……因爲不受人注目的緣故」</p>
<p>這樣對人對己，兩不負責的新生活，豈不鬆弛而空虛了嗎。</p>
<p>所以要提倡國貨，必須厲行新生活，要厲行新生活，必須規定用制服，看似漫不相關的三件事，而其實是有聯鎖性的。</p>

<p>— 天然</p>
<p>日本人的愛用國貨，不要說是男子女子，卽是兒童，敢說目下已經做到個個小孩子，不肯服用非國貨的。這種情形，我是在日本新眼看見的。我還記得，我在日本參觀一家吳服店，有幾個十二三歲的小孩子，到店買物，揀了又揀，揀到了合意的貨品，連連的問那店員，中不是本國貨？有一家人家，母親替小孩子穿了　件非國貨的服裝，這小孩子在學校中爲敎師訓責，同學嘲笑，結果是撕破了衣服，帶哭回家，告訴他的母親，不該替他做這種不愛國的服裝，丢了臉子。這種愛用國貨精神，吾不說小孩子的好，還是歸功於小學敎師。我國人的近來提倡國貨，可算熱閙之至，尤其</p>
<p>是最近的兒童節，這天的熱閙，似乎表示中國前途的很有希望。我說這不是趕熱閙，是寫契據，是加重小學敎師責任的契據，從今以後，做母親的責任。固然加重，做小學敎師的責任更重。小學敎師呀！你們敎的是什麽，你們應敎的是什麽，你們的責任，從今以後要加重了。</p>

<p>— 琱</p>
<p>「提倡國貨」，「服用國貨」，這種聲浪，閙得塵囂　上；試問仇貨完全的消滅嗎？摩登女郎服用嗎？這種唱高調的提倡，我可以斷定仇貨仍汗珠般的輸進。</p>
<p>怎樣呌唱高調的提倡呢？就是表面上說得很是熱心，而暗裏却是售仇貨的大主顧··照這樣的提倡，仇貨能不絶跡嗎？如欲絶跡，非照下列做不可。</p>
<p>㈠依身作則……邵爽秋博士，當他提倡丨丨土貨運動丨丨的時候，他竟「依身作則」的穿土貨，與工人無異；出外參觀演講，雖被人輕視，仍不减他的精神。我希望現在一般當局者的姨太太小姐們，和各界的領袖們，個個都能像邵博士一樣的「依身作則」，保愁奸商出賣仇貨呢？如能實行，我想一班的同胞一定能個個服用，决無顔再售吧？</p>
<p>㈡擯棄外貨觀念……在初用國貨的時候，一定有幾個摩登人們，對於仇貨仍戀纞不捨，而不願用國貨的心理；因國貨不及外貨華麗，又要滅少美觀的姿態。「你要曉得。國貨有國貨的美麗，外貨有外貨的美麗」，决不能存外貨必美的觀念；我希望初用者，快將這種觀念擯棄，如不，安能普遍「服用國貨」呢？</p>
<p>㈢廉價國貨……在「提倡國貨」的時候，希望各國貨商塲，從速廉價出售，决不顧慮蝕本；現在的犧牲，就是將來的發達。因使一班的人們在過渡「服用國貨」的時候，尤其要廉價，並改良商品；如此，我想或可剥得一班人們，喜購國貨的心理。</p>
<p>以上幾點，亦是老生常談，但如果諸位同胞都能如此的做去，其收效之宏，一定是很大的。</p>

<p>自食其力的三寳女郎，她披上了美亞綢廠出品的蘋色春裝！領問繫着國貨的絲繡手帕！足穿陳嘉庚公司的白番布橡皮底鞋！分外顯出她柳眉杏眼，婀娜矯健的一個美人兒呢！</p>
<p>她的芳名三寳，就是她愛好國貨三實的出典，這三件寳貝，是她的情人Ｓ君所贈與的。</p>
<p>Ｓ君並不向三寳求婚，他想；男女熱戀，不可勉强的，應該聽其自然！她覩物（國貨三寳）思人！或者也許會鍾情於我呢！她也覺得Ｓ君是可親的人，想他並不因巿小惠而追求異性·却落落大方，處處愛國家，愛國貨！愛屋及烏！簡眞是愛他的愛人呢！哼！和他做終身伴侶，多麽幸福！這機會怎　錯過呢。　　她不徵他的同意，在這春光明媚的佳日，報紙上現着很大的廣告，是三寳女郎和Ｓ君的結婚啓事，親友詫奇，都說··紅絲繫足國貨年！這是三寳女郎的一段佳話哪！</p>

<p>西湖煉乳公司，爲蕭家幹所創辦，慘淡經營，于茲七年，營業日見發達。所出燕牌煉乳，求過于供，最近蕭君發明奶粉機，出品甚佳，已呈請實業部專利十年，名爲「滾筒眞空並用式」。此外又有煉乳壓氣機之發明，此機係利用某氣體將煉乳罐內空氣壓走，使罐內煉乳色味，久存不變。是項發明，爲吾國首創，已引起各界之注意。國民政府建設委員長張靜江先生，亦認爲吾國有希望之創造事業，加入發起人，以示稱許，上海銀行界如交通銀行，浙江實業銀行等，均允予以實力之贊助。聞該公司因近來乳製品粉進口，年達兩千萬元，而乳粉最多。且關稅甚重，每晨公斤徵國幣四十八元有奇，實爲挽回利權之最好機會。故公司多除擴充普通股至十二萬元，已全數認足外，并擬公開添招優先</p>
<p>股八萬元。據蕭君云；該公司現有乳牛二百餘頭，牧地二千餘畝，牧塲擴充，絶無問題，且製造方面，亦甚有把握，各國所有乳製品，該公司　能製造，且所製機器，均蕭君所設計，將來全部機械造成，聞所需不足四萬，如向國外定製，最少須十數萬元，而機械能力，或較外貨爲高，其中之單效眞空機一只，眞空度能走至三十度以上，　已打破世界眞空紀錄。蕭君爲深造計，現正探求其高空之原理，果能如願以得，則將來世界之眞空表，或不致以三十度爲限，將另有高度眞空表以替代之也。</p>

<p>諺云··「若要家不和，除非討個小」。這是一句忠告男子們，不可討小老婆的金玉良言。凡是婦女們，聽了這一句金玉良言，自然，一百二十分的聽得進。因爲，做丈夫的討了小老婆，做妻了的便有被遺棄的危險！所以凡是婦女們，聽了這一句忠告男子們，不可討小老婆的金玉良言丨「若要家不和除非討個小」丨豈有聽不進之理呢？那麽，今年是「婦女國貨年」，現在我不妨把這一句婦女們聽得進的金玉良言丨「若要家不和除非討個小」丨，改一下說「若要國不亡，除非愛國貨，」以忠告婦女們。可不知道，婦女們聽了，也和那句「若要家不和除非討個小」的金玉良言，一樣的聽得進嗎？</p>

<p>— 阿那</p>
<p>社會上之打拱作揖，叩頭請安，本來非現代應有之習慣，而是「在昔盛世」的餘風。北方人比南方人奴性重，是因爲帝都附近，受了傳統的壓迫的緣故··旗人善於請安，「京派」官氣甚濃厚，便是例子。</p>
<p>這過錯應遠遠歸到叔孫通身上，他没有出息，無從表現自己，便大草「朝儀」，使漢高祖喜歡，可謂奴才之尤。二十世紀自由平等的時代，奴才應洗心革面了吧，在美國，總統或高等官吏，其氣焰遠不及我國一小知縣或「老爺」。無非因爲他們是文明，民治；而咱們則否。他們在做事，咱們在搗鬼。……</p>
<p>然而人類精神從來是自由的，無論怎樣受着奴才的敎</p>
<p>制，他本性還是要自由。許多做小官的五情薰灼，想做大官，正因爲官小了還受壓迫，做大官可以較自由故。從來没有人會受壓迫而甘心，被當作一塊磚頭嵌在牆壁里會甚舒服。然旣爲磚頭矣，逃不出牆壁之範圍，便只想怎樣壓迫同僚，想做頂上那一塊，所有的重量都在自已以下了，没有什麽更高的壓迫，換言之。卽更能丨丨自由。</p>
<p>經濟制度改觀，情形不同了，有金錢便較自由，便是商業社會的發展，無論被人看不起，捱駡，受壓迫吧，成了大富翁便可以變爲「要人」或「聞人」，那時不會受壓迫了，可以向壓迫者施行報復，可以左右許多事情，好像皇帝。於是人們低首下心，笑駡由他笑駡，爲官或爲。商，皆志在弄錢，好像把住了正脈，變成開金礦者。　　社會上「三十六行」「七十二行」業的人們，無非這麽敎育自己，敎育子弟，敎育旁人。有人說三個普通歐洲人不抵一個猶太人利害，三個猶太人趕不上一個中國人，這話是有理的。中國是傳統的受着壓迫，當了奴才而又想當主人，一律在苦里掙扎！努力向自己刻苦，狠，嗇！也狠，嗇，苦毒旁人。</p>

<p>才從車站送了一個朋友回來，走下平門橋時，我的傘觸着了别人的傘，我抬起眼：</p>
<p>那反破汕紙傘下的小貝</p>
<p>子母女倆都銳銳聲地··</p>
<p>「呦！」兩張慈菇顔色的臉都苦笑了。</p>
<p>不待她們說，我猛地想起來，今天小貝子要去上海，這是她昨晚上在打井水時告訴我的。這妮子有一個寒假，每晚到我那兒去學幾個字，深而黑的大眼珠子裏透露着聰明，到現在已能把平日習誦的歌曲寫在紙上。</p>
<p>昨天小貝子告訴我說她要去上海，我還以爲是開玩笑哪。這時我不自覺地背轉身來，又挨着她們走向車站去。　　「却是挺正經的吃飯的地方啦。小貝子的寄媽給介紹的，說她的嗓子嘹亮柔和，學清唱滿好的，哽，只是唱唱曲兒，并不丨丨」她媽舒了口氣，「也呌没有法子啦，她	爹欠着債，連買蠶種的錢都没有呢。」</p>
<p>「她還小啊，十五罷？」「十六了，花一樣的年紀呀！得點錢混混罷了。」</p>
<p>那女人說得怪坦白的，可是緊鎖的眉宇間告訴人，她的心和那反破油紙傘似的，有着無數的破綻。</p>
<p>小貝子始終缄着口，好像在堅忍地噎着人生的苦水。我想起了她伶俐的口齒，和夏夜隔河的河的清脆的歌聲。</p>
<p>爲着這點點天賦，小貝子找到了「生路」。</p>
<p>在月台上，迅速地響過了三次鐘聲。小貝子無聲地踏上車去，眼角上噙着淚。</p>
<p>「好好地去吧，到上海站上有你寄媽來接。」</p>
<p>車頭上噴着墨龍一樣的烟，　軌道上發着響。</p>
<p>小貝子媽抽噎着和我走出了地道。</p>
<p>細雨依然無厭地灑下來，我們撑着傘默默地在石道上走，懷着一樣的沉重的心。</p>
<p>我暗暗估計着··小貝子洗乾凈臉，敷一點脂粉，再穿上一件文素的旗袍，該是個惹人憐愛的歌妓了！</p>

<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>丨無窗室隨筆之四</p>
<p>「一代不如一代」！這句話在一般人的眼裏已成爲中國前途的定命論了，其實這是句毒辣的諷刺話，我們從正面說，無論如何應該說是「一代比一代好」。</p>
<p>「一代不如一代」是消極的看法，如果平心靜氣的把眼光朝前看，那在大事小節上在可以瞪明這句話的反面丨「一代比一代好」。</p>
<p>前一代的人呌過去的時代把他們的腦子定了形，鑭鞭都不能抽他前進一步，希望他們好，等於希望一個垂死的人，這是没辦法的，誰有回天的力量去把過去的時代翻過來呢？這時代到底是後來的，這時代裏的人到底不同上一代。我曾問一個靑年尼姑對於鬼神的意見，她說「什麽鬼神，我因爲念經才有飯吃，我口裏是說有鬼神的」。的這個回答很坦白。她贊成一個結婚的和尙，她說那是應該。從她這些話上看，如有機緣她一定會把自己解放了的。　　你如果出一個「你將來</p>
<p>的志願」這個題目給一般中小學生做，他們一定是說願意做一個革命家，打倒帝國主義，打倒軍閥，</p>
<p>打例……，把世界弄到大同。這話裏没有虛假，因爲小學生還不會弄虛假，我曾見過一本鐵路小學學生做這個題目的文章，他說將來願意做個段長，這表現了幼小的心總是潔白的。</p>
<p>一般人曾把「過三十者全殺」，視爲一個恐怖的口號，是的，這話有些來得太過份。然而你指望前一代的人把世界弄好，那眞是愚而且妄！把希望放在後一代人的身上，那希望一定會有結果的，雖然那果實的大小無法預量。</p>

<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>游了杭州，想寫一篇遊記，但是覺得没有什麽可寫，杭州不曾給我一點好題材。不過這不能怪杭州，當怪的還是我自己··遊杭州根本不應該從上海出發。</p>
<p>假如從僻陋的鄕間出發，一到杭州，必定是很有可觀的罷。但是從上海出發的人，總在心裏帶了一個上海去，而杭州正在竭力要變成上海，這就使上海遊客們有了「曾經滄海」「除却巫山」之感，杭州遂見得「難爲水」「不是雲」了。</p>
<p>譬如那黃包車。上海的黃包車夫，在十分擁擠的馬路上，也拉得頭頭是道，從從容容。偶有阻碍，嘴裏只喊一聲「喂，」便算警告了。杭州的車夫</p>
<p>，則雖在行人稀疏的塗上，口中也老是喊着「喂，靠小！靠小！」和别的一句我所不懂的話，顯得很慌張忙亂。還有，杭州的旅館的門口，常常塞滿了車和車夫，使他人簡直不能通過，但看在杭州的人好像是滿不在乎的，到杭州的人也無可如何。我以爲，杭州這個都巿的性質，在黃包車上面是顯示着一部分的··没有秩序，而其實是並不需要怎樣嚴整的秩序。因爲杭州的生活根本不大緊張，平日是散淡慣了的，在平日，車夫口中喊着「靠小」或什麽，倒是散淡的表示。</p>
<p>因爲平日散淡慣了，所以一到特殊的緊張的時節，杭州便不免慌張忙辭整不起秩序來。　　我到杭州的幾天中，正是杭州特殊緊張的時節。一則是香期，善男信女來巡禮；二則是春假期，學校師生來游賞；加之三則，是浙江全省童子軍集中省會舉行檢閱的時期。</p>
<p>杭州人是慌張忙亂了，然而很高興，因爲這是一個賺錢的機會，今年的生意全靠這幾日，於是不必說，旅館漲價，菜館漲價，划子漲價，車子漲價……一切全漲價。而那漲法實在是很可怕的，</p>
<p>有一晚，我在一家菜館中吃飯，看與我隔着三四張桌的一個顧客在呌醋溜魚吃，這是杭</p>
<p>州菜中有名的一樣。當醋溜魚燒好時。一個堂倌拿了交給另一堂倌，呌遞給那顧客去，同時吩咐道··</p>
<p>「五角八或六角四，隨你自已算去就是了。」</p>
<p>因爲他們說話時正在我的身帝，所我聽得很親切，心中便有點納罕。</p>
<p>那一天正逢清明，大概是杭州最盛的一日了。</p>
<p>過了兩日，盛况減了一點，我也想吃醋溜魚了。偏到同一菜館去，先向堂倌問明價錢，據說是四角八。</p>
<p>等到吃時，貨色原是和那天的「五角八」或「六角四」的一樣的。我不禁想到那天的顧客到底付了「五角八」呢還是「六角四」呢？</p>
<p>諸如此類，這時節的杭州的物價，是荒唐得驚人的。</p>
<p>那時候我還没達到像大人樣地懂事的年齡，對於他們底談話是不大了解的。呆是，當時那些健談的人們，往往在我底記憶裏出現，尤其是那個比誰都高大過的，比誰都率直過的吳大牛。</p>
<p>他是一個不大愛說話而肯做事的三十歲左右的男人。有着刀劈下來也不屈服的性子子丨丨在善良的農民裏常常發現的性子。和他站在一起，就好像站在一株堅實的，驕傲地直立的大柏樹旁一樣。他在我們一個有錢的族叔丨丨永祿叔家做長工。早上，他把女工們摘好的桑葉一籮籮地挑到巿塲去；把「蠶床」在忙着挑選熟蠶的成年女人和十三四歲的孩子之間移動着。此外，早晚還要到桑畿那邊去灌溉，和幫做永祿叔底瑣碎的家務　　「唔，這樣才是我底伙計。用心呀大牛！」蠶事頂忙的時候，永祿叔常常鼓勵地對大牛說。他爲了鼓吹用低廉的代</p>
<p>價收買希望外的勞力那此事，便愛用貪慾的口吻對人說··「其實世上的人都變成耕牛樣聽話，耐苦就好了。祇要有幾個人領領頭。看，聰明人多了，世界不就越壞了麽？」</p>
<p>那强壯的漢子没有給事主底讚美誘惑，他像祇爲了命運而勞作，但有時超過他底忍耐了，他便會用更陰鬰更笨重的動作來表示他底懷疑；這使事主激起了鄙視和憤怒。（未完）</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>初秋的天氣，就像故意和人們開玩笑似的，早上，它散佈着薄寒，一到午刻，竟會晒出比夏天還使人難受的陽光，一天裏的氣候，變化有很大的差别。没有風，儘是蒸發着熱氣，三點鐘的長時間，我看别人的臉上，差不多都冒出汗珠子，呆是這些夫和我一樣，忘記用手帕去擦，整個心神，彷彿全讓內心裏的沉鬰佔領了。</p>
<p>忽然，台上有人領頭喊起來··</p>
<p>「大日本帝國萬歲！」</p>
<p>「大滿洲國萬歲！」</p>
<p>台下的人羣，跟着喊，喊聲紊亂像一塲大的吵閙。然後，要人們在憲警衛護之下坐上汽車走了。</p>
<p>遊行了。路徑是出運動塲走尙儀街，然後是糧米行街，到省長公署　，再轉至糧米行街，新開門街，出新開門，沿大馬路到老提法司，轉入岔路口朝陽街，入大東門河南街再回到運動塲散隊。遊行隊伍的次序，憲兵在前，然後是日本尋常小學，同文商業，一師，一中，女中，女師，一中，縣中，助產，巿小，縣小。人海波動了，警倧呼喊聲，人們哄呌聲，亂竄，亂跑，全個運動塲裏，起了個絶大的騒動。</p>
<p>彷彿聽說這是個巿民慶祝的大會似的，然而施行的隊伍中，學生而外，找不到一個小巿民　　大旗在前面打着，軍樂隊奏着樂，人羣慢慢地移動着。路旁人人，黑壓壓的，我們恰作了戲劇中的丑角。</p>
<p>到省長公署原來是爲熙洽呼三聲萬歲丨我面對着身旁清明如鏡的松花江，再放　到江南的峻嶺高山，暗想道樣難得的山清水秀的吉林，這樣好的東北大陸，竟會讓日本帝國主義永遠盤據！我們三千萬民衆竟會安安靜靜地做着亡國奴，讓子子孫孫再也翻不過身來！呵，我不能相信！</p>
<p>清朗的天上，　着幾朵薄薄的白雲，江風微溫地飄散着，誰不說是一個好的秋日！然而，一年前的今日，二年前的後幾日，東北大陸上不正搬演着醜惡的騙劇和慘酷的屠殺麽？</p>
<p>再轉上糧米行街，看到嶄新的「恊和書局」的新招牌。（這卽是以前的中華書局，是由敎育廳下令更改的名字。）心想幾年之後，恐怕單是「中華」的字樣，我們都無法見到了。</p>
<p>隊伍中的人，漸漸地减少下去，當我發覺有些學生私自溜到隊外去了時，正苦疲倦得懶於遷動脚步的我，也找個機會，把身子溜到隊外面，躱進街邊的小胡同裏了。</p>
<p>時候已經十二點鐘了。</p>
<p>「半天的功課，算是作完了。」</p>
<p>這樣想着，一個人慢慢地走上回家的路··</p>
<p>「哪一天，我們才可以不上這樣的功課呢？哪一天，我們才能夠恢復自由呢？……」（完）</p>

<p>— 海如</p>
<p>帝國主義者爲了要企圖解决其自身及其相互間底矛盾，不能不再度分配巿塲，實行以武力來重新瓜分殖民地。次殖民地的中國，目前正處於受帝國主義瓜分宰割的形勢之下。自九一八事變以來，日帝國主義者先后奪取我東北四省，瓜分之局業已開端。而西陲的康藏問題，現又繼着東北問題而起。無疑地，藏兵之侵入川康境內，乃是英帝國主義者欲實行以武力來瓜分中國之明白的表現。</p>
<p>我國的民衆們，似乎眼光过於狹小了，他們只知道日本，只知道東北，而對於西陲的邊疆問題，大多漠然視之。這樣，會使英帝國主義者更得以侵略我國西陲，乘我國人未遑西顧之際而使西陲數省入其掌握之中，亦在其意料中的事。过去如安南之歸法，缅甸之屬英，不是同樣的情形麽？</p>
<p>當局對於康藏問題，素來不甚注意也不及注意，所謂「整理康藏計劃」「與英嚴重交涉」……等，直等於紙上談兵，毫不發生效力。近來如川康總指揮劉文輝之通電求援，要求政府作有力的接濟，而政府對此，除了通電飭令抵抗而外，所謂接濟，畢竟怎樣接濟呢？這也許是鞭長莫及吧？</p>
<p>在英帝國主義者指揮和利用之下的藏兵，劉文輝之不能抵抗是必然的，最近據重慶新民報載康藏形勢業已和緩，康方且派姜郁文代表前往與藏方交涉，這顯然可見是劉文輝之無接濟而出於妥恊，於是乎不能不由長期的抗而變爲短期抵抗，再由短期抵抗而變爲「和平抵抗」了。然而英帝國主義者之積極以武力侵略西康，並不爲了劉文輝之妥恊而終止的，反之，愈是「和平抵抗」，更會促成藏兵之積極侵入，結果，會使西康全省，全部入于英人之手。</p>
<p>事實果是這樣··據成都三月二十七日民是日報載··「藏番進犯金沙江之消息，一再披露前訊，近更逞其頑强手段，思有以貫澈其侵略政策，不惜其生命</p>
<p>財力，積極進犯不已。并聞親英派噶倫靈絨咸，主武力奪取失地，并宣言如果</p>
<p>戰敗，寗臣於英，不願求和於漢。……」成都新新新聞又載有··「康藏戰事勢將擴大，金沙江以西，藏軍强渡增援。和平之說，現已絶望。」（三月廿六日）</p>
<p>成都偏於西陲而地近西康，這些消息，不用說是千眞萬確的。英人之力圖西康，並不因調和妥恊而終止，正如日人之力圖東北。並不因了不抵抗之故而感恩不前的。帝國主義者對於弱小民族之武力侵略，只有以武力才能回答武力，以牙還牙，以血洗血，這是中國今日所應有的態度。</p>
<p>康藏問題是日漸趨于嚴重了，希望全國的民衆們加倍地注意吧！</p>
<h3 id="c257">兒女其態的婦女呼籲和平 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>戰魔已在天空徘徊許久，使這絢爛的大地蔽上一層慘淡的暗影，預示着不知幾許的人類生靈，將生牠血吻下遭到毁滅。前十幾年的血蹟未消，更大的腥風又要興起，這引動以「慈悲」爲懷的人道主義者呼籲和平，大出風頭，而懦弱的巡孺之輩就英知所措，啼泣不止了。　　最近法國婦女在此哀苦莫告中，乃加入「世界婦女團」以提倡世界和平運動，就是這一表現。我們在其有「敎會世界友誼同盟」甘地朋友及國際婦女恊會列名，致各國有力敎會諸領袖之請願書　中看到··「吾儕旣爲兒童之母親，世界兒童卽吾儕之兒童，吾儕安能坐視吾儕之兒童互相屠殺，而不加以援手乎？「幾乎一字一淚；再如「世界已入危險時期矣，吾儕以天眞兒童之名義，亦以母親愛護兒童之名義，懇求世界之清神權威者，造成犧牲之集團，繼續不息，要求各國政府放下屠刀也」，則畢盡其流眼抹淚，徒呼「昊靈不明，降此巨凶」之態。</p>
<p>有人說「眼淚是女人的武器」，那這些「憂心時事寢食俱廢」的婦女，竟將這一法寳拿到殘酷無情的戰神前來使用了。帳前虞姬，猶勸不轉霸王的好殺之心，何况這一紙空文的請願書，復投向所謂「精神權威」之各國敎會領袖乎？假若全世的呼籲和平者，都效此「苦口婆心」而隨諸「娘兒們」之後，則眞正和平實現之日，將不知「伊於胡底」也。因爲我們在目前呼籲和平，爲和平奮鬥，絶非「懇求」精神權威者可能奏效，而必須有下列三點認識··</p>
<p>第一，現在戰爭必然爆裂的原因，</p>
<p>不是甚麽殺星下凡，使人類遭此浩刦，用是現社會制度下經濟發展的結果。因爲生產關係成爲少數人龔斷生產機關，太多數人出賣勞力的狀態下，就逃不了生產过剩，也就逃不了經濟危機，牠的洪潮可謂激盪了整個的世界了。而站在維護現制度的統治者看來，欲求經濟恐慌的消解，只有出於「重分天下」的戰爭，所以用「要求各國政府，放下屠刀」的辦法來祈求和平，那無異否定他們自己，這樣呼籲和平的方式，不是與虎謀皮，那就是欺人欺己！</p>
<p>第二，所謂各國敎會諸領袖的「精神權威」，實質上就是各備戰毒菌的傳播者，一方面在他們十字架的掩護下，以「祖國」「光榮」等的催眠，驅人走向戰爭，一方面又以昇入天國的空言，使人退出擁護和平的實際活動，陷入聽天安命之消極的自多毁滅。這一批「仁愛」爲懷的人道主義，無寗說他們是破壞和平的補充者。</p>
<p>第三，就如砲彈無情一樣，一般主戰者也是不可理喩，若僅徒托空言的憑幾張宣言申請書來說得他們「解甲歸田」，那是比要張飛唱「毛毛雨」還要困難的事實。這一點須得認識，切莫諱病疾醫反對戰爭唯一的方法是以戰爭來制止。放掉懦弱的兒女之態，凖備人民的力量，用反對主戰的統治者的方法來制止。</p>
<p>可歎目前的「和平」爲懷者，均不此之圖，不是認賊作父的與鬼爲隣，就是塑佛自拜的聊以自慰了。現在想用通天法術來以招大乘至上之靈，求其施恩普渡，解救衆生的人，豈不是很多麽？</p>

<p>— 孟君</p>
<p>一脚踏進了門，一切都感到異樣，一顆頽唐的心，此刻已開始蠢動起來。眼裏看到的，耳裏聽到的，像是這個身子到了另一個國度。要不是我怕春會困人的話，我將一定在這裏追尋我所謁求的「春」。</p>
<p>裏邊已經有人起來招呼，但我不懂他們的話，只好點了點頭，揀個座頭坐下。跟着，一個和我們同言語的侍者走來，很謙和地問我們··可要喫些什麽？便由同去的老友齊回答了··啤酒吧。</p>
<p>老友齊是此道的老馬，我同他來，今天還是第一次。事前雖承他告訴我··</p>
<p>只顧盡興一下，什麽都没有關係；但一個言語不通的我，興打從那裏盡起頭呢？啤酒是樽滿了一杯，送到我面前來了，也只好仍點了點頭舉起杯子呷了一口。</p>
<p>嘴上儘是没話可說，心却砰砰地跳</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>動得很利害。</p>
<p>一個是這裏的女人，走到我面前，用着英語問我··「你會說英語嗎？」天喲！這就有了辦法，因爲英語我還能應付。</p>
<p>「怎麽不會呢？請坐啊！喝杯啤酒吧？」我就拉住她，坐了下來。</p>
<p>這時，我的目光整個的射住了她。她身上的任何一部份，我都没有把牠輕輕放過，一直從她的頭到脚，無不用着全力來注意。一襲印花深色的綢衣，六七寸大的袖口，袴肩下還掛着很大很長的一幅；一條極闊的雜色的綢帶將胸部纏得緊緊地，在背的一部份，像是裏面還塡着一塊什麽，凸得高高的丨丨我眞不懂這是什麽意思，定要纏着這個累人的東西。但是，我以爲這樣很好看，大概不致於爲着好看才纏的吧？</p>
<p>「你眞美麗！」我只能用英語來傳達我的意思。她對我微微地笑了笑，一個身子便振近了我些，伸出手將酒杯拿到我嘴邊，我盡量地喝了大口。</p>
<p>一切都感到異樣，尤其是那一殺那的面部表情。要不是我怕春會困人的話，我將一定在這裏追尋我所謁求的「春」。</p>
<p>「喝一口這個吧？」我把酒杯换到她嘴邊。</p>
<p>「我不能，給我來杯咖啡吧。」</p>
<p>一忽兒，咖啡已端來。</p>
<p>「你呌甚麽名字？」</p>
<p>她告訴了我，我學着她念，至四五遍，還是不能記清楚。一個又長又難念的名字，到現在我只能記得最前的三個字音··Ｆijisu··········以下都忘記了。</p>
<p>不去理會這些吧，反正我能認得整個的她。她似乎也揣摸到了我的意思，全身已貼緊了我，一個熱的吻，已在等候着我了。</p>
<p>她敎我學着唱她們的歌，我也學着唱了。先前念她的名字，已夠我難倒的了，這歌，當然更没有好成績。但是，異樣的感覺已全部支配了我的心，什麽都會變成有意義起來的。</p>
<p>她擺脫了我的兩手，站起身，移着輕盈的步子，走到放話匣的地方，開了匣蓋，唱起一隻大和的歌曲。雖然我不懂它唱的是什麽，那種輕快的調子，來襯托這一室愉快的空氣，該是最的當没有。她站在那話匣旁，按着那音樂的節拍，身子顚着，腰扭着，臉朝向我，不斷地輸送過來迷人的媚笑丨丨這一瞬間，我覺得我是至尊，我已勝利。</p>
<p>她重又回到我身旁，帶給我的是更熱烈的表情。我已不及顧到我周圍的一切，或看看老友齊有否和我同樣的陶醉了！</p>
<p>我們離開了那裏坐上街車後，老友齊帶着頗得意似的口吻問我··「不壞吧？異樣的情調。」</p>
<h3 id="c259">女朋友 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>眞奇怪，近來碰着許多男朋友，誰都在問着誰有没有女朋友，如果有，他便隨聲扯了滿天的讚揚語，再三的跟你道喜，而且佩服你手腕高妙，居然捞到目的物。若是零呢？那麽他又會很眞摯打拍着你的肩膊，呌你下點工夫，拚命些，或者還答應替你帮忙，自己覺得非當詫異，何以一般男朋友都那樣熱中於女朋友的追求，谁都急迫地希望自己又來一個。開口女朋友，閉口女朋友，一似除此之外便没有旁的事體一般，甚至逢　　詫人物色介紹也有。</p>
<p>也許因爲年齡方面的關係，迫於生理上的强烈的要求，情感超於理智，自己無力管束自己。於是有這種近乎性猖亂狂的急色兒的行爲表現出來。我曾將這些情形細加玩味，生理上的壓迫固然</p>
<p>有相當的道理，但其他尙有一個很大的原故在，就是對於「女朋友」這名詞的概念的誤解。一般人總不認清，以爲女朋友卽情人，當然囉，情人是女朋友蛻化而來的。可是事實並非如此單純，女朋友是女朋友，情人自情人，這其間有着很明　的分　，决不認爲彼此是二位一體的。誠然，情人的前身經常便是女朋友，由女朋友進则爲情人這是眞實。却不能一概而論，女朋友不一定便會變成情人的。並且也有永遠僅是止於女朋友的關係而己。有些人的女朋友簡直滿天下，你能夠說他所有的女朋友都是他的情人嗎。同樣你自己如查有女朋友（假如也不在少數），則你對於這些人没有友誼的關係，没有友誼以上的交往。這樣說是很明白的了。情人是一件事，女朋友又一件事。可是有不少人誤解「女朋友」這一名詞，於是由此誤解而產生出種種可笑亦可哭的悲喜劇來。記得我有一位舊同學，曾經跟一個女朋友挺要好，而女的亦表示親暱不過，兩口兒上館子，上影戲塲消遣的日子倒並不算少。可是從來未曾說過一句關於戀愛方面的話，肉體的接觸止有臨别握一握手而己，以外没有發生過别的動作。看樣子似愛非愛，迷離撲朔，弄得男的坐食不安，日夜乾着急。後來有一次男的終於勇敢地開口各她求愛了，而她馬上翻了臉，怒目責駡了一塲，說什麽是因爲敬重他的才能學問所以樂意做朋友，不料他却狂妄地做出這種荒誕的舉措來。自此就斷了根，於是男的開始單戀的失戀了，在痛苦悲慘中過着日子。像這樣的情形委實多着，一切的錯都是你自己造成，不能怪女朋友的無情，而是你没有把女朋友與情人之間的不同點看清。到這裏，話又得說回來，也有許多情人是從女朋友之羣衆成長的。但這須要時間的培養，以及聽其自然的發展，不可强致。最好是不要留下一個情人的觀念在女朋友的身上。</p>

<p>跳上××路的電車，風吹來，已經暖洋洋地，我第一次感覺到春的到臨，看見紫燕連翩着從電柱邊穿梭般閃過了，似曾相識呵！那幽吩的嗚聲，那黑翅，牠從北國帶回來春的消息了。</p>
<p>鄰童笑着折來一枝綠楊，我把牠插在窗檻上，每天，我起來總先看見迎着風，那碧葉；牠是容易會引起客子的離思的。於是我觀察到隔園的樹色，浮映着濃翠了，我悵然「春在枝頭已十分」　　偶然走過門口，幾個摩登女郎，一行列地站着似乎在等待什麽人，那粉壓長眉，似乎永遠是微笑着。袖子很高很高，原來她們已經換上了「輕紗薄翼」的外衣，就越襯托出婀娜輕盈的體態。我認得春還在她們的一雙玉手上，也只有她們能抓住了春。</p>

<p>編者先生··</p>
<p>我雖時常見到業餘信箱討論婚烟問題，可是，我這婚姻問題，與人家有些特别，在百思不解之下，祇得也來煩請先生了，諒先生旣爲大家除痛害，必不會不理我的罷！先生，慈善的先生，請速速地覆我吧！我的心切切地熱望着呢！</p>
<p>事實是這樣的，我有一個叔父，在年靑時就離鄕很遠的到江陰去謀生。嗣後，不幸我祖父母相繼逝世，而叔父與</p>
<p>家母感情不合，故不常到家，後來，就在江成家了，以至今日，家庭小康，惟吾嬸母從未生育，且年已四旬，於是他們常有伯道之憂。</p>
<p>自我懂得人事以來，時常去信安慰，他們也很鍾愛我。在家姊出閣時（前三年吧）他們也同返鄕，在歡樂之中，叔嬸曾謂大衆曰「吾哥嫂僅此一兒，吾倆亦僅此一姪兒，（卽我）我們四個人將來祇有靠他一個子，將來父母爲他娶一個媳婦，我們將來亦爲他在江陰娶一個，那末我們兩房都有安慰了」那時大家聞得這話，都不在意，不過歡笑一陣而已。</p>
<p>一二八戰事爆發後，我因無力就學而致輟學，嗣後，感受生計的痛苦，在</p>
<p>家亦是無聊，於是遠道探訪叔嬸，旣至，叔嬸待我甚佳。不久，接得親戚來函，代我謀事已成，喚我卽速前往服務，於是我就急急來申就商。在江時叔嬸曾提及某姓之女，甚爲能幹，爲我做媒，那時，我因感生計之困難，就對他們說，「我年尙輕，還談不到呢！」</p>
<p>去年他們曾來函數封，催吾至江陰過廢歷新年，我因他們的熱望，於是便應允了。誰料這次至江陰後，他們又提起這事，（比前次更爲急切）在新年裏他們要我到她（指說起的她）家去賀年，（她的母親是嬸母的妹妹，早知我在幼時已訂婚？可是她，並不因我已訂婚了而不肯，她反而同情，願把女兒嫁給我。）我被說得没法，於是也答允了，在年初二就到她家去（我叔嬸同去）到了她家，嬸母就爲我介紹，而那女子倒很自然並不在意，却還喚我一聲「哥哥」。可是我覺慚愧，「妹妹」這一句終没有出我的口。嬸母告知我，她在家處理家事，很是幹鍊，並亦稍認得字（現因家庭人口稀少故不求學，她只有一個，没有兄弟姊妹的）她比我小三歲（我現年十九）並問我的意思如何？然而我却很羞，祇一笑而已，没有答覆。然那女子見了我，彷彿一見如故，言語，態度非常自然，在我的心目中，的確是一個很好的女子。。</p>
<p>然而先生，我又要告知你，我在很小的時候（大约五歲吧！）已由父母作主，與離鄕約三里許的某姓女，訂立婚約了，然而我從未與她見過面，我曾數次要求，始終未遂，故該女子如何？一點都不知道，在我的心中，恨她家過於固執了。現在有欵問數條，乞先生爲我解答。</p>
<p>㈠因我家庭特種關係，可否一男二妻？於法律上應有何罪？（重婚罪的頭銜，總脫不了的）</p>
<p>㈡照我的選擇，在幼時的，我認爲不滿，可否否認？解約時要費鉅金嗎？㈢幼時的解約後，我應對吾老母，如何的態度與安慰？（因老母堅持不應是我所料到的，）若實行後，她恐要爲我而犧牲。</p>
<p>㈣如若拒現在的，（江陰的）那叔嬸與我及吾父母感情勢必完全喪盡；他們的一番熱望。也化爲烏有。加以這樣一來，或許會有意與我父母爲難。（回家把他一半之家產變賣，及追索數十年的田租，因田皆爲我父母所耕種，）或弄到我家不像家了。那豈不痛惜嗎？我要顧全兩方，怎樣去對付呢？</p>
<p>現在我立於危崖之上，偶或弄得不好，將來就是我一生的痛苦，悲哀。先生，請你放出慈悲的心來，指示一切，事關切急，希你卽速覆示。　　卽請</p>
<p>撰安·　　　　　　　　　　徐中堅敬上</p>
<p>答··編者認爲徐君所以發生這個問題，是因爲他祇爲着家庭方面着想，並未考慮到個人的未來幸福，更示顧及到他與社會的關係。如果照徐君叔父方面的主張，爲徐君娶兩房妻子，則不特徐君將來更感覺到「生計之困難」，精神上亦必要發生莫大的痛苦。而且，多妻風氣，宗祧觀念，是男權優超時代，封建勢力下的習俗，若照男女平等原則，及現代倫理觀念講來，根本是不合理的事。所以我們對於徐君的「一男二妻」希望</p>
<p>，不論從社會成個人立塲講，都是應當堅决反對的。</p>
<p>徐君究竟怎樣處置呢？我認爲，應當根據着這樣的原則；卽婚姻應當以自己的意志來决定，而選擇則應當以對方的品性，彼此的感情，以及最最緊要的卽能否輔助你發展事業等爲標凖，不應以家庭的意見爲轉移，更不應爲了左右爲難之故而採取糊塗的折衷辦法丨一男二妻。</p>
<p>徐君似頗中意叔父方面所介紹之婚烟，故編者以爲徐君可正式與對方訂婚，而取消父母之原約。至於解除父母代訂婚約，本信箱時常論及卽當初未同意而又達到法律上成年者，解約是不生問題的，至於金錢，則要看對方是否有損害賠償權，以及賠償的大小而决定，編者是不能瞎猜的。</p>
<p>至於第三第四兩項困難，徐君如果認清「婚姻是自己的事，並非爲父母（或你的叔父）而結婚時，想來也是不成問題的。你可對自己的父母解釋，你的要與江陰之女爲婚，並非是遵從叔父之命，更不是反對你父母，這事實出自願，叔父嬸母，在你看來，不過是一個介紹人而已；而且，就是不與江陰方面成婚，也是要取消你的原婚約的。</p>
<p>固然，你這樣做去，不論你怎樣的向母親解釋，她一時也未必就能贊成你，但是我們不有句俗話麽··「父母是有兩條心腸的，一條是疼腸，一條是恨腸。」所以你如果以後對於父母仍是非常敬愛，對於叔父方面也並不故意賣好，依編者猜想，你的母親决計能夠諒解你，更不會爲你而犧牲的。　編者</p>

<p>— 亦敏</p>
<p>前年是暹羅華僑敎育的全盛時代，如開辦中學，創設幼稚園，舉行各校聯</p>
<p>合學術競賽，以及盛大的聯合運動會等，都曾哄動過一時，一種與奮活潑的氣象，瀰漫于全暹的華僑社會。可是不久就受到了意外的摧殘，那就是暹政府頒</p>
<p>佈的所謂强迫敎育條例。</p>
<p>本來，强迫敎育是各國都有的，但暹國去年頒佈的條例，却是打破了國際通常的習慣。他們不僅限定本國的兒童，要受這種敎育，我們華僑子女，竟亦在被强迫之列。换句話說，就是要我們丢棄福國的文字，來讀他們的暹羅書。這是很顯明的，要把我們三百萬華僑同化！當時各校雖曾向他們請過願，但因內部不能一致，結果終於失敗了。</p>
<p>現在，華校都已改授暹文，僅僅是少數年齡超過他們規定的（十五歲以上）或是暹文程度已夠的學生，才能讀中國書。但這是極少的少數。所以，我們可以說··暹羅的華僑敎育，現在是完全破產了！</p>

<p>目前暹羅的華僑，實在是已到了萬分危急的時候，如不設法挽救，前途眞是不堪設想！我以爲一方面固然要請政府趕快和暹國訂約，一切問題，都可以迎刃而解。但更重的，還是僑胞自身的覺悟。只要大家摒除地方觀念，集中人材與經濟，一德一心，就不難恢復到以前的黃金時代因爲暹羅是一個農業國家，工業還非常幼稚，一切日用必需品的製造，目前是大可做得的。至于居留政府的增加苛稅，我們應該一方面據理力爭，一方面用科學的方法改良工廠管理，使成本减低，决不可因　　食，自蹈　境。再講到農業，現在已經墾殖的，不過是湄南河中流及河口一帶的冲積地，還不到全暹面積十分之一，其餘廣大的原野，也大可去開發。關於强迫敎育和移民條例等苛律，也不是絶對不能廢止或修改的。總之，今後暹羅華僑的成敗，全要看大家的能不能覺悟？（完）</p>

<h3 id="c265">「大地」影片的攝製 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>賽珍珠女士的「大地」小說攝製影片的事情，曾經聚訟紛耘了好久，現在决計開拍了。自從希爾君（George　W.Hill）率領了米高梅公司的職員來滬之後</p>
<p>，「大地」影片究竟進行到什麽程度，外間知者絶少，其實他們到各處搜集材料，已經邁步猛進，有好幾星期之久。希爾君茲將工作情形發表，於是這影界之謎方才解决。</p>
<p>希爾君擔任「大地」影片的導演，他對於這部重要的影片竭力主張實地取材，而摒棄一切假的佈景，因此他不遠千里的親自奔波於上海，蘇州，杭州，南京，北平以及內地的村莊。他率領了米高梅公司的專門技師攝取眞實的背景，工作的繁重，眞是出於一般人想像之外。有人問他究竟怎麽了？他說；「這却很難回答。我們對於富人的床褥以至農民的耕具等一切的物事無不在實地攝拍着。」</p>
<p>他又說，「有人疑心我們在把中國分裂，其實，我們確在搜集一切物事，凖備在好萊塢樹起一個中國的縮影哩。」他又說··「我們並不祇以仿製爲滿足。我們却把牠們購買了來，運回好萊塢。截至現在爲止，我們運往好萊塢的約有一百九十箱，而我們的工作十分之九已經完成。此後，我們將以幾個月的工夫去完成我們的佈景，或者今年秋末或明年春初「大地」影片就可僣與世人相見了。」</p>
<p>希爾君對於中國頗感興趣，滿望幾年裏重遊舊地，那時凖備租一只畫舫悠</p>
<p>優的往中國內地旅行。他心目中以爲北平是世界上一個最値得留戀的美麗都巿。他發覺中國人是善於合作的人民。國民政府曾經指派兩人帮助他們，而十幾個豪富的中國人却很喜歡獻示他們的珍寳。因此，他很有機會一睹私藏的寳石古銅以及華貴的裝飾。他欣賞之下，對於中國的國粹很是羨慕。他稱讚中國人的禮貎並不是一種口惠而實不至的虛僞，因爲有時他對於一物愛不釋手，那主</p>
<p>人便慷慨地贈送給他。</p>
<p>賽珍珠的小說叙述一九○六年至現在的事情，又全以中國爲背景。他說；「我們應有中國的服裝，主角以及普通演員，應穿一個時代一個時代的服裝。因之，他僱了中國的匠人設計圖案已經好幾個月了。專門技師和攝影師，完全不厭求詳的攝取中國的眞景，期望不失賽珍珠所描寫的中國人生活」。他們一行昨天又到南京去，再过幾個星期他們就要束裝回到美國去了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c266">「小婦人」評 <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 羅平·巽之凌鶴</p>
<p>“Little　Women”丨大上海丨</p>
<p>㈠</p>
<p>「小婦人」裏的女主人翁玉，是作者露意莎，奥爾珂德自己，而「小婦人」的一切，便是她</p>
<p>自己的遭遇。</p>
<p>是的，那平凡而瑣細的美國家庭生活的叙事詩的小說是廣汎地流行着。在十六年前，威廉白蘭地改編成了舞台劇，後來更搬上了銀幕，但是無聲的；在有聲電影時代的今日，便重</p>
<p>又製成了有聲片。</p>
<p>這是一部世界文學名著，但並不是凡文學名者都値得我們接受，這裏需要一步批判的工作。</p>
<p>文壇與影壇的交流，未始不是現代的一種好現象，在貧乏的中國影壇，以「春蠶」的映出爲記號，也開拓了一条中國的文學電影的新路，雖然不久就受到了打擊。但是，我們不可隨便以「文學電影」來向觀衆欺騙，却是很容易明白的。當電影商人在以原作爲號召之時，我們更應該用嚴肅的態度來指摘它。</p>
<p>自然，「小婦人」自有其相當之價値的，它是描寫了現社會下的小婦人丨賢妻良母的一羣。</p>
<p>這一羣，對於有錢的姑母怨恨而又馴服，她們對於父母的孝順，姊妹的和愛，她們對於富翁的餽贈和恩寵的欣慰和感激，她們對於一個初生孩子的窮人，予以人道而慷慨的施捨，她們對於她們的前途的没有理想和瞻望，或者想做個超人的作家丨這一切，便是她們，所謂「小婦人」與「好妻子」的生活。</p>
<p>在「小婦人」裏所表現出來的作者的人生觀，確切地說··祇是一種「安貧哲學」，所以作中人物個個都是安分守己，樂天知命，她們的最高目標，是在這社會裏面勤勤懇懇，地做一個「好人」，做一個好的女兒，好的姊妹，和好的妻子。在這故事中間儘有貧窮，不幸，和悲傷</p>
<p>，但是我們那些可憐的主人翁們所表示的祇是哀愁，順從，而没有絲毫的思慮。</p>
<p>同時，更主要的一點，是在這圈子裏面，全是一羣善良的人們，四姊妹可不必說，父母，勞笠，柏魯克，倍亞敎授，乃至使我們討厭的伯母，丨丨在這一羣裏面，相互間絶没有絲毫利害觀念，自私的思想，他們反有的祇是同情，慈愛，欣喜，和感激，換句話說，這兒的人們好像和我們隔離得很遠，很遠，用他們常常講的一句話來形容，她們都是安琪兒，都是超人。原作者和影片製作者，都在這種善良的「安樂克已」主義上用功，反以不論在小說，在銀幕，確是非常出色地現出了一團和氣，看了這作品，會將你帶到一個樂園，一個烏托邦，而使你忘却了人間的醜惡和憤怒。我們可以同情這樣善良的人們，同時，具有這種善良性質的人們，現社會也並不是没有，但是，當我們空虛地同情的時候，我們便會忘記了現實的憤怒，當我們劇中主人翁們的天眞和善良所感動，而淌了眼淚和賠了微笑的時候，在這時候我們便會消散了對於現實的愁苦。勸人安貧，克</p>
<p>已，消解現實社會中所蘊積的憤怨，以及糢糊對社會問題的觀察，這些就是「小婦人」的人生觀所遂行的客觀的任務。</p>
<p>我們要顧到作品的客觀的性能，並且要看到作品的被什麽人歡迎，我們更應該審愼一下了。「亡命者」和「小婦人」的同時在我們面前公映，正給了我們一個好的對照，我們相信，「亡命者」是遠比「小婦人」値得稱讚的，如果我們覺得要看一看「小婦人」而還没有看过「亡命者」的話，那麽，我們以誠摯和嚴肅向敬愛的讀者貢獻一點意見··還是先去看「亡命者」吧！</p>
<p>㈡</p>
<p>「小婦人」是一個美國的Ｈome　Life的故事，可以說，「小婦人」裏的人物就是美國的一般的平凡的人物。她們的遭遇也就是在美國內隨時隨地可以發生的遭遇。</p>
<p>爲着要將這種平凡的而瑣屑的故事詩化和美化起來，而「使觀衆同情地流淚，會心地微笑」，電影製作者最努力的是零圍氣的描寫，這一點得到了相當的成功。編劇（Herrman和</p>
<p>Mason）也很能删除繁屑，相當暢逹地叙述出這一個長期間的故事，當然，這兒也祇能說勝任，而没有特殊的表現，尤其在梅格和柏魯客結婚之後的部分，就稍見疏緩，入後，大約是急於向着結束進行，所以漸見零亂，當然，海本湼和保羅，洛加司的名演技，挽救了這缺點很多。</p>
<p>對於個性的描寫的細膩和生動，「小婦人」的導演是很成功的。如玉起光以頭髮賣錢，可是在晚上却又惋惜着她的失去了的頭髮，玉的天眞和富於情感的個性便刻畫出了。</p>
<p>還有一點，是導演很能支配和操縱觀衆的感情，從喜到悲，從悲到喜，都描寫得恰到好處，譬如最初，一羣天眞的孩子正在高興，母親進來，告訴她們父親來信，接着，就是母親慢慢地讀信，可是信未讀完，幾個特寫，女兒們都已經涕淚沾襟，這一塲十分使人感動。這樣的手法同樣的又在接到父病電報時用了一次。丨丨幾塲原作中悲嘆和哀愁的地方，都處理得很好，最出色的是玉的賣髮，和珮絲病狀的一段。佩絲病危時美未　以睡爲死亡，故作驚人之筆，亦極盡操縱觀衆感情之能事。</p>
<p>這戲的大部分的成功，是在海本湼的個性表演的成功，也許可以說，差不多使我們幻想，愛爾考德的原著是爲着她而寫的。全篇無懈可擊，此人的是可兒。盛名固不易虛致也。</p>
<p>講表演。法朗茜絲，提的梅格也很成功，在她訂婚前的一段，望一望窗外，對鏡理一理雙鬚，看見了玉，狼狽，可又掩不住心中的歡喜，和玉講了一段話之後，她的未婚夫進來，喘氣，故作鎭靜，而內心却又十分驚喜的表情　　一　　　女兒　之一　，不日在南京開映。</p>
<p>，的確演得出神入化。羅加絲的倍亞敎授，亦佳。</p>
<p>㈢</p>
<p>以這一影片爲例證，我們不妨來看看小說和電影之不同的分點。這一方面固然因爲一萬尺左右的膠片的容量决不像數十萬言的小說那般豐富，所以不能將小說全部搬上銀幕，而更</p>
<p>主要的是二者各有獨特的樣式和手法，所以在銀幕上所表現出來的，已經不能和小說完全一樣了。在這不妨舉出一二實例。</p>
<p>當原書第一章所寫的是每一個人的個性之輪廓的表寫，故事的中心是饙贈媽媽的聖誔節禮物之凖備。而在銀幕上的却是先說明當時的環境，再個别的寫到自媽媽以下每一個小姑娘的業務和生活。這將小說中一二句文章所說及的都畫面化起來，同時在時間的前後。也在有出入。</p>
<p>聖誕節的早晨，當媽媽自外面回來的時候，原著的對話是··</p>
<p>「媽媽·恭喜！謝謝你的書，」四個女兒同聲說··「我們已經讀了，以後每天，都要讀的」。</p>
<p>「恭喜你們，我的孩子們，」媽媽說，「我很高興你們已經讀了，希望你們繼續不斷的讀下去。不过，我有一句話要告訴你們，隔壁人家有一個婦人在睏着，還有一個新生的孩子。在一張床上，六個孩子擠在一堆，這樣才可不致於凍死，因爲他們家廛没有一點兒火。他們也没有東西吃，所以她的大孩便來告訴我，請求我去帮助他們。我的姑娘們，你們可以把你們的早餐，送給他當作聖誔節的禮物嗎？」</p>
<p>「幸虧你來得快，」玉說··「我們還没有吃掉」。</p>
<p>「可以允許我同去，」佩絲說··「拿這些東西支給那些可憐的孩子嗎？」</p>
<p>「我把牛酪和烤餅拿去。」梅說。</p>
<p>「我知道你們願意的，」母親說··「你們大家都去帮忙，回來我們吃些麵包和牛乳當早餐，午見于吃好的。」</p>
<p>而電影上的對話却是如下··</p>
<p>「香腸！那兒來的？」玉揭開蓋了大聲的說。</p>
<p>「還有烤餅哩？剛好每人兩塊。」梅亦高興的說。接上大女兒梅格說··</p>
<p>「還有咖啡！」」以後蓓絲嘆息着說··</p>
<p>「恐怕父親還没有咖啡喝哩」！</p>
<p>「我記得，」老女僕說··「當年在你父親桌上，是每天都有咖啡喝的。」於是梅天眞而驚奇的說··</p>
<p>「眞的嗎？那末，當初我們是很有錢的囉。」</p>
<p>這時候自外面回來，接受了女兒們的禮物之後，她說··「孩子們，且慢一會兒，我剛從隔壁人家來。她們新生了一個孩子，那個母親和六個孩子，都在睡着。他們又冷又餓，只有一條被，所以他們就互相擁抱着取暖。好女兒，你們願意施捨你們的早點給他們作聖誕節的禮物嗎？」·········</p>
<p>由於以上例證，我們可知道電影之特殊的手法。電影可以不必借重文學的心理描寫，而在畫面上又必須簡潔明瞭以動作代替文字。而有聲音電影又加强了對話的效果，於是每一個人物之個性便可從對話中描寫。如蓓絲說了一句「恐怕父親還没有咖啡吃哩！」便可看出她　　順和善。玉的男子氣世在方講中表現出來。至於梅的孩子氣的自私，也在最後拿起一盆菜時不願意的神氣表現出來。</p>
<p>好了，在電影上，劇作者的確是理解了原</p>
<p>著精髄而充分的使用了電影手法。反之，假使依據原著之故事的次序，完全一樣，那末將必然的得着沉悶嚕　的結果。在這裏强有力的回答了木天先生之「春蠶」應當和原著一樣的問題</p>
<p>。同時在這一影片中我們多少可以學習文藝電影之編劇技巧了。</p>
<p>㈣</p>
<p>因爲篇幅的限制，我們只好在此帶住。然而對於這一震撼美國的影片，却是大　的批判到了。</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The provincial government received a telegram from Fengrun County Magistrate Xu Ren stating that on the 9th, thirty Japanese soldiers suddenly arrived in the county, traveling in six automobiles and carrying a large quantity of military supplies. After arriving in the county seat, they stayed at the Fusheng Hotel. The soldiers divided into groups to conduct surveys and photography outside the city, and there are intentions to station troops there for an extended period.

<p>(Tianjin, 2:00 PM on the 10th) Japanese troops in Tangshan conducted combat exercises at the West Station again, without prior notification to our side. When the gunfire erupted, residents were extremely frightened and closed their doors. The exercises ceased around 4:00 PM, and the residents then learned the truth. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a Tangshan telephone report, the Japanese garrison in Tangshan suddenly announced martial law from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th to resolve the Kailuan labor strike. They conducted live-fire exercises at the old shooting range in the Western Hills, without prior notification. The citizens suddenly heard cannon fire and thought the labor strike had escalated, creating a tense situation. Fortunately, the Public Security Bureau made every effort to maintain order, and stability was restored. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng is scheduled to depart for Tongzhou on the 12th and transfer to Yutian on the 13th to handle the disbandment of the security forces. The planned takeover of Malanyu has been temporarily delayed, and there is still no progress, awaiting instructions from the Kwantung Army before proceeding. Huo Shi is scheduled to return to Gubeikou on the 13th. It will be determined whether to send police to replace the departing puppet police at Nantianmen based on necessity. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Youxun is scheduled to return to Gubeikou on the 13th. According to him, the situation in Gubeikou is calm. The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Zou Hongen, and the vice-chairman, Mr. Guan, are both leading traitors, and the merchants and residents are dissatisfied. Li has been elected to succeed them. The puppet border police team may withdraw by the end of the month. There are now Japanese individuals in Gubeikou Town, Sakata who runs a car company, and Matsuda who runs the Gubeikou Grand Hotel, both secretly selling drugs. The Zuo Zhi Bureau has decided to find ways to suppress them. The agricultural revitalization in Gubeikou has not yet begun. The agricultural revitalization team has sent personnel to inspect and allocated 8,000 yuan to handle it.

<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying returned to Zhangjiakou this afternoon at the summons of Song Zheyuan. According to him, the situation in Chahar East remains unchanged. After arriving in Zhangjiakou, he will discuss everything with Song and Qin and return to Beiping in four or five days. Qin Dechun will soon inspect Chahar North and then transfer to Chahar East.

<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying said that Song Zheyuan plans to inspect Shangdu, Zhangbei, and other counties in a few days. To avoid causing disputes, he will temporarily not go to Chahar East. Although the situation in Chahar East is unchanged, the crisis is imminent. The Japanese and the traitors they use in the North China war zone are still active at all times. The Japanese military construction is also being actively arranged daily. The people of Chahar East are suffering unspeakable hardships after the disasters of war and natural disasters. The provincial government has decided to find ways to provide relief. After Longmensuo was taken over by Zhang Zizhong's division, the area is peaceful. Yanqing is also being defended by the provincial army. He intends to stay in Zhangjiakou for three to five days and then return to Beiping.

<p>(Nanjing) On the issue of through traffic and mail, Minister of Communications Zhu Jiaxiao said that the Executive Yuan has not considered the issue of through mail so far. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications still adheres to the past policy of blockading Northeast postal services and has no intention of changing its approach. As for the problem of smuggling mail occurring in various places, after the ministry instructed local post offices to conduct a thorough investigation, much evidence has been obtained. Now, each bureau has been ordered to strictly prevent and vigorously suppress it and to consult with the customs to assist. Chinese-British postal air services are out of the question at this time. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's plans to develop international routes are a misunderstanding related to the company's ordering of ships from England. As for the investigation of smuggling mail, evidence has been obtained in Shanghai, Wuhan, Qingdao, and Tianjin. The method is to receive mail sent internationally at extremely low prices, concentrate it in Dalian, and then, according to the type of destination, use ships to transfer it to Japan for forwarding, or transfer it to Europe through the South Manchuria Railway via Japanese puppet post offices. Our post offices still send it to Europe via the Suez Canal. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications believes that since September 18, Eurasian mail has been affected due to the puppet organization, and mail coming to China via the Siberian Middle East Road has been affected. Overseas Chinese in the UK and France have long found it difficult to send letters to inland China. The UK and France hope that the Chinese government can find an appropriate solution and request assistance, citing the example of establishing telecommunications between outside the customs and inside the customs. It is learned that the Ministry of Communications has planned special and flexible measures for letters transferred from outside the customs by friendly countries and will consult with President Wang, Chairman Jiang, Huang Fu, etc. to decide on ways to remedy this convenient method of communication for friendly countries, absolutely avoiding changing the original proposition, so as not to tacitly recognize the puppet state.

<p>Zhao Dazhong Still Hiding in Tangshan</p>
<p>Accomplice Zhang Zhenfu Arrested</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The office received a report that the Kailuan labor strike was completely resolved on the 11th. More than a thousand workers from both internal and external shifts returned to work early on the 11th. The mining company still followed the procedures of the 10th, and workers returning to work must hold a certificate of proof and be verified by the police in the mining area before being allowed to enter. Workers are forced by livelihood to strive to return to work and no longer show any arrogance. Those external workers who are not allowed to return to work are all asking contractors to issue certificates on their behalf. The Kailuan Mining Bureau accepted the official opinions on the wounded and dead miners and plans to offer appropriate compensation and hand it over to the contractors for distribution on their behalf. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Qingdao) A group of more than 500 bandits led by Liu has slunk to Qishan Town in Anqiu, and will advance to attack the county seat. The two stations of Xishan and Huangqibao on the Jiaoji Railway are tense. At about 2:00 AM on the morning of the 11th, Dai Shihan, the police chief of the road, led three platoons of road police on a special train west to reinforce the defenses along the line. Another small group of about 200 people slunk north from Xiangzhou in Zhucheng. For precautionary measures in the Big and Small Zhushan mountains, the authorities in Jiaozhou Redstone Cliff, and this city, as a result of a meeting with the Qingdao office of the Third Fleet, sent the deputy commander of the defense corps, Qin, leading a mixed battalion of security forces and marines, to take a boat to Haixi to block the bandits. Wen transferred the marines stationed in Liuting back to this city to increase the defense. At 7:00 AM on the 11th, two planes were sent to bomb with bombs in the rain, but they did not drop the bombs due to the heavy fog, and immediately flew back.

In the afternoon, they arrived at Linjia Village, 20 miles east of the city. Captured bandits confessed that Liu's department actually numbered 700 or 800 people and wanted to escape to the Hongshiya port in Jiaoxian. Shen Honglie has sent warships carrying marines and planes to deploy along the coast to intercept them. Liu was riding a yellow horse, accompanied by two light machine guns, personally resisting the injury in Zhangjiayu, Yishui, and was supported by his entourage and fled on horseback. Central government planes will arrive within days, and the extermination of Liu can be expected. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e29">On the Rumor of England Continuing to Build a Port in Singapore - Heng <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>According to Japan's Hochi Shimbun, Japan believes that England's continued construction of a port in Singapore is enough to threaten Japan's security. It intends to demand that England stop the project, otherwise, it is determined to overturn the 5:5:3 ratio of the British, American, and Japanese navies at the 1935 naval conference. It is not yet known what kind of prior negotiations the Japanese government will conduct with England regarding this move. However, in general, the British and American telegrams from abroad in recent days have maintained the 5:5:3 ratio for the future naval conference, and England's continued construction of the Singapore military port is bound to be carried out and cannot be ended by negotiation.</p>
<p>England's attitude towards Japan after the September 18th Incident has been confused and difficult to grasp. Generally speaking, it is more passive than the United States. Its intention seems to be to use the power of the United States to contain Japan, not wanting to reveal its own power and cause Japan's hostility. However, after the attitude of the American Democratic government to abandon the Philippines became clear, England's attitude towards Japan also changed from passive to active. For example, the recent Japan-India agreement to restrict the dumping of Japanese cotton products and the expansion of the British naval budget can be regarded as signs of a change in attitude. Moreover, the continued construction of the Singapore port project is enough to show its serious vigilance against Japan. Since the tense relationship between Japan and the United States has gradually eased, the forces that could be used to contain Japan are now unavailable. Then, for England, it has to change to a proactive attitude towards Japan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the interests of England and the United States in the Far East, England's interests are greater and the United States' are smaller. If the United States abandons the Philippines, it will not harm its founding. If England abandons the Straits Settlements attached to the port of Singapore, the British Empire may collapse as a result. The most obvious thing is that British India, Australia, and New Zealand will all fall into a relatively isolated position due to the abandonment of this strait. Japan's superior navy can easily oppress them without any difficulty. Therefore, Singapore is actually England's gateway to protect India and the vanguard to shield Australia. As for the protection of Far Eastern trade, it is a secondary matter. Therefore, the military and commercial value of Singapore Port is far greater than Gibraltar and Aden. In order to cope with the situation, Japan has reached an agreement with the Siamese government to open a canal in the Kra Isthmus of Siam to connect the Indian Ocean with the China Sea. The expenses will be lent by Japan. From this, one can see a glimpse of the infighting between England and Japan.</p>
<p>From our point of view, England's change of attitude towards Japan this time, although it has nothing to do with us, is very obvious that it is unfavorable to Japan. From a passive point of view, this move by England can be said to be out of self-defense. From an active point of view, its intention is actually to pressure Japan at the 1935 Pacific Conference to make it submit, which can be inferred.</p>

Before their departure, Lieutenant General Pu Mu, commander of the 16th Division, and Zenta Wakayama, commander of the 3rd Division, went to Beijing in late March to discuss matters related to garrisoning with army officers. Minister of the Army Hayashi also went to Kyoto and Nagoya to address the departing troops. The advance party of Pu's troops, led by Major Yazawa, departed on the night of the 3rd. The second batch also departed on the night of the 9th. Lieutenant General Pu Mu, leading over a thousand staff members, departed from Kyoto this morning by armored train. The unit leaders of the first and second departures are numerous, but they all departed by train from small stations near Kyoto. Except for the advance party, the main force of Wakayama's troops will depart within days. The total number of the Pu Mu and Wakayama troops is 30,000.

<p>(Beiping) Information from official sources states: 1) Russo-Japanese military preparations have become fiercely intense. With the completion of the Jihui Railway, military transport has been shortened by two days. Japanese reinforcements to northern Manchuria and the Guadai troops are all landing at Qingjin Port and being transported north via the Jihui Railway. 2) The Japanese are forcing Antung and various eastern counties to make air defense preparations. According to the methods of the puppet air defense association, merchants and civilians are levied funds to purchase aircraft. Antung County has already purchased two aircraft and thirteen anti-aircraft guns and three sound locators. Japanese garrison troops in the eastern area have also dispatched many Han traitors to various places to promote air defense. Guerrilla forces were discovered in Youpenggou, Antung. The Japanese army burned down the entire village, causing many casualties among the people, a tragic sight to behold. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Hirota Koki declared to the "Courier de la Serra," "The most serious factor in the tension between Soviet and Japanese relations is the concentration of Russian troops in the Far East." Izvestia commented, "It is well known that the Japanese militarists are eager to invade and seize. It is only natural that the Japanese militarists desire that the Soviet Far Eastern border be without defense and that its defensive works are not worthy of attention. However, the examples of China and Manchuria are sufficient to show that Japanese imperialism cannot resist the temptation to destroy the inviolability of the borders of other countries whose national defenses are not strong. The Soviet Union must do everything possible to consolidate border defense work, precisely because we understand the innermost thoughts of the Japanese militarists." (TASS dispatch on the 10th)</p>

<p>Taipei: Over 20,000 Taiwanese aborigines live scattered in deep mountains and valleys. Because of excessive Japanese oppression, they seize opportunities to kill people and vent their anger. They originally had over 30,000 firearms, which have been repeatedly confiscated by the Japanese authorities. They currently have only over 4,500 firearms left, which are their only tools for resisting Japan and hunting. The Japanese authorities, considering the urgency of the international crisis, fear that the aborigines will rise up during wartime, causing Taiwan to suffer from attacks from within and without. The police bureau of the Governor-General's Office forcibly confiscated 120 aboriginal guns last year, causing unrest among the aborigines. This year's budget allocates 25,000 yuan to confiscate 500 aboriginal guns to prevent aboriginal resistance. (United Chinese Press communication)</p>

<p>Tokyo: At 3:40 PM today, Minister of the Army Hayashi visited Prime Minister Saito at his official residence and suddenly submitted his resignation. Although the Prime Minister tried every possible means to persuade him to stay, it was to no avail. His resignation was therefore confirmed. The Prime Minister is currently considering a successor for the Minister of the Army. The reason for Minister of the Army Hayashi's resignation is that his younger brother, former Tokyo City Assistant Mayor, Yūkichi Shirakami, was implicated in the Tokyo City bribery case and was sentenced guilty this morning. (Dentsu dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The actual reasons for Minister of the Army Hayashi's resignation are: 1) After this session of the Diet, the power of the zaibatsu (financial cliques) and political parties increased sharply, putting great pressure on the military. 2) Saionji did not approve of the military's policies. 3) The young officers of the military criticized Minister of the Army Hayashi for failing to maintain the strong stance of former Minister of the Army Araki. (United Chinese Press dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Hayashi has formally submitted his resignation. Prime Minister Saito, knowing that he cannot persuade him to stay,</p>
<p>immediately began considering a successor, with General Jinzaburo Masaki, Director of Military Education, being the most likely candidate. (Dentsu dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Hayashi resigned suddenly today. This action has nothing to do with politics. It is specifically because his brother Shirakami bribed several Tokyo City Council members on behalf of the Tokyo Gas Company in August 1932 to seek the continuation of the company's business license. The incident was exposed and he was charged. He was sentenced to ten months in prison today. Upon hearing this news, Minister of the Army Hayashi, considering his reputation at stake, immediately submitted his resignation. The Prime Minister tried his best to persuade him to stay until twilight, but Hayashi remained steadfast. Hayashi said that as a brother, he should be responsible for his younger brother's disgrace, so he had no choice but to resign to apologize to the nation.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding a certain incident that became an issue in the Diet, Minister of Justice Oyama met with the Prime Minister yesterday before the regular cabinet meeting to report the results of the judicial authorities' investigation. The issue is not as politically damaging as the world has reported. However, according to recent investigations, lawsuits have been filed against five major people due to company relationships. Depending on how the investigation progresses, there is a risk of affecting important areas. Therefore, the government is still concerned about this.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) After Minister of the Army Hayashi met with Prime Minister Saito, Secretary Arisue made the following statement on his behalf: "Because my brother has been convicted, as Minister of the Army, I have no way to face the Emperor, and I also feel deeply sorry for society, so I am particularly cautious." As for whether a resignation has been submitted, there is nothing to say at this time. (Dentsu dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Prime Minister Saito met with Minister of the Army Hayashi, he immediately summoned Chief Secretary Hori to discuss how to handle the Minister of the Army's resignation. The Prime Minister believes that this matter is originally related to the brother of the Minister of the Army, Mr. Shirakami, and is not a problem for the Minister of the Army himself, so he should not approve the resignation, and should strongly</p>
<p>persuade him to stay. If the Minister of the Army insists on resigning and directly submits it to the Emperor, he must also request the Emperor to return his letter of resignation, saying there is no need for discussion. (Allied Press dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) President of the Rikken Minseitō, Reijirō Wakatsuki, went to Itō at the end of last month to recuperate. He returned to Tokyo at 11:30 this morning and told reporters, "The other day, the Prime Minister visited Saionji to consult on the cabinet's progress and retreat. I believe that government leaders cannot consult on their own progress and retreat. Although the government has now decided to carry out new policies, it is ridiculous whether it has the power to reorganize finances and still fail to resolve the deficit public bonds. The Minseitō gave unconditional support when the current cabinet was established, but in today's situation, although there has been some progress in the diplomatic aspect, it is impossible not to have objections. Regarding the issue of cooperation between the two parties, if the Seiyūkai (Rikken Seiyūkai) is sincere, it can be carried out." (United Chinese Press dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The military expressed active support for the new policies decided at yesterday's regular cabinet meeting, saying that these policies, from the mission of the current cabinet, should have been started before former Minister of the Army Araki's advocacy of national policy. Although the decision was a little late, it is greatly welcomed. All departments should start anew, forget the past, unite together, and cooperate in carrying out the decision,</p>
<p>assisting Minister of the Army Hayashi in realizing these three items. Among the three items, the military is most concerned with educational reform and rural countermeasures. As specific investigations proceed, it is worth noting how Minister of the Army Hayashi will speak. (Dentsu dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of joint policy research between the Seiyūkai and the Minseitō, although the Seiyūkai is temporarily taking a laissez-faire approach, since the government expressed a blatant disregard for the attitude of political parties regarding the issue of the Minister of Education, the Minseitō has also expressed dissatisfaction with the government. As a result, the interests of the two parties have become aligned. Voices advocating for political parties are rising within both parties, standing on a common front, and the momentum to confront the government is gradually becoming stronger. This situation is sufficient to reconcile the feelings of the anti-coalition faction within the Seiyūkai. There are also those who advocate that joint research on emergency countermeasures and various policies can be agreed upon. The movement for cooperation between the Seiyūkai and Minseitō has improved significantly. Chief Secretary of the Seiyūkai, Wakamiya, will visit Chief Secretary of the Minseitō, Ōasa, within days to inquire about the intentions of the Minseitō and then seek to consolidate the framework of the coalition movement.

<p>1) The reorganization of finances and the recovery of public bonds must wait until the business community is back on track and be implemented at an appropriate time. 2) Railway revenue must be incorporated into the general account to reduce the amount of public bonds, planned to be implemented from next year. 3) Subsidies or incentive fees for various projects must be reduced or cancelled. 4) In order to maintain a balance between revenue and expenditure, reforms in management methods must be decisively implemented. 5) Reform of the tax system cannot be implemented next year because the economic world is still in a time of panic; it should wait for an opportunity to implement.

They reached a consensus on the development of Manchuria and the Japan-Manchukuo cooperation and adopted the following cooperation policy: 1) Developing industry: "Manchukuo" is naturally a raw material country, but in order to develop into an industrial country in the future, encourage Japan's financial and technical assistance, and cooperation with Japanese and "Manchukuo" economic groups. 2) Open door: Welcome the fair investment of capital from various countries in Manchuria, but it must not conflict with Japan's special interests based on the special nature of the Japan-Manchukuo economy. 3) Regarding the Russian issue: Expect the establishment of the North Manchurian Railway negotiations and take this opportunity to determine the border and resolve the issue of communist propaganda.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations has decided to ban all brothels worldwide to prevent the sale of women and children. The report on which this decision is based details the presence of official and private prostitutes in major cities around the world. This improper business can easily be prohibited if the authorities do not issue licenses. These prostitutes are often deceived by people who offer them job referrals and lure women into their trap. Once the women are stranded in a foreign land and cannot speak the language, they have no choice but to live a life worse than slaves. Some believe that if prostitution is banned and they change their appearance, it will inevitably be impossible to investigate. However, if they can be given proper jobs after the ban, they can easily become good citizens.</p>

<p>The Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium, is one of the most famous cathedrals in Belgium. The interior walls are made of marble, and the altarpiece is composed of three famous paintings by the Van Eyck brothers, 15th-century painters, entitled "Adoration of the Mystic Lamb." The three paintings were previously placed in three different locations: one in Ghent, one in Brussels, and one in Berlin. But the Treaty of Versailles stipulated that the Berlin painting be returned to Belgium, so the three paintings were restored to one place. The church verger would lower a curtain over them every night and roll it up the next morning. Today, when the verger rolled up the curtain, he found that one of the paintings had disappeared. The thief must have hidden in the church when the door was locked at night and stolen the priceless painting.

<p>Eden Indicates British Plan is Amendable</p>
<p>Diplomatic Negotiations Must Continue</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Steering Committee of the Disarmament Conference decided today that May 23 will be the confirmed date for the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference. April 30 will be the date for the next meeting of the Steering Committee. The Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, has the authority to postpone the dates of the two meetings if he deems it necessary. British Lord Privy Seal Eden suggested that the Steering Committee should meet on April 30 in order to continue direct negotiations. Eden said, "If a disarmament convention is to be established, it should be done as soon as possible, because a convention recording disarmament is worth our efforts today." Eden continued, "The British proposal can be amended again, but the</p>
<p>delays caused by changing circumstances are of the utmost concern to Britain." Subsequently, Soviet representative Stein stated that the Soviet Union is prepared to accept any disarmament convention, but it must be conditioned on the unanimous acceptance of the Soviet Union's neighbors. Stein also suggested that the Disarmament Conference should pay special attention to the non-aggression pact initiated by President Roosevelt based on the Soviet-defined aggressor boundaries. If the Steering Committee of the Disarmament Conference can convene on April 30, it will draft a new disarmament convention based on the points of agreement negotiated since last October.

<p>(Geneva) The Bureau of the Disarmament Conference met at 3:30 PM and decided that the Bureau would meet on April 30, and the General Commission would be convened around May 23.</p>
<p>However, Chairman Henderson may advance or postpone the date as appropriate depending on the negotiation situation. A detailed telegram reports other speeches made by various parties at today's meeting. Here is a brief explanation of the intentions expressed by each</p>
<p>party: 1) The representatives of Soviet Russia, Poland, and Sweden strongly stated that the purpose of the Disarmament Conference is to reduce armaments, not just to limit armaments. 2) The representatives of Belgium and Italy believe that the ongoing diplomatic talks are more promising, so they believe that although a date for the General Commission is scheduled, it is futile to set a date unless there is certainty that all parties agree. 3) The words of the British representative Eden are sufficient to represent the concerns of the delegation and deserve our attention. Eden advocated for "swift action," saying that Britain</p>
<p>is well aware that the facts in Germany are very dangerous to peace. 4) The French representative Massigli expressed sympathy with Eden on this point. In short, today's meeting was conducted in an atmosphere of sincerity and clarity. Tomorrow, Eden, Massigli, Belles, and other representatives attending the meeting will hold a closed-door meeting to exchange views to await the results of the Paris-London diplomatic talks. (Havas dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The general situation at today's meeting of the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference has been noted in a previous telegram. Here are the detailed speeches of Chairman Henderson and the representatives: 1) Henderson advocated convening the General Commission on May 23 and said that almost all major countries are increasing their military budgets. The disarmament competition has restarted and continues to this day. Some public opinion believes that the situation is hopeless, and these people clearly despise the meaning of disarmament, intending that countries should act independently regarding armaments and return to the previous chaotic international situation, with each holding strong armor and sharp weapons to confront each other. Henderson concluded by urging countries to cooperate sincerely, based on existing treaties and previously agreed principles, to establish a disarmament convention so that the new trend of military competition can be stopped and the ever-expanding danger of war can be avoided. 2) The British representative, Eden, advocated that the Bureau postpone the meeting until April 30 so that he could carefully examine the situation and express his views on the level of confirming the reopening of the General Commission. Eden said that the opinions of France and Germany on various issues differed greatly. For example, regarding the calculation of military quotas, it is still difficult to reach agreement on colonial troops, trained reserves, and military groups other than formal troops. Also, German short-term conscript troops must go through a certain trial period before they can be equipped with defensive</p>
<p>weapons, but when this trial period begins and how long it lasts are points that are difficult to agree on. In view of the various difficulties, Eden advocated postponing the meeting of the Bureau to allow diplomatic negotiations to continue. 3) The Soviet representative Stein spoke after Henderson and Eden, saying that as long as disarmament is universal, the Soviet Union is happy to accept any reduction in existing armaments. So-called universal disarmament means that all countries, without distinction, implement disarmament uniformly. Stein believed that the Disarmament Conference should study one: the Soviet proposal regarding the definition of aggressor countries, two: the French proposal regarding security, and three: the US President's proposal regarding non-aggression treaties. 4) The French representative Massigli spoke next, reiterating the main principles advocated by the Disarmament Conference before Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference on October 14, 1933, and said that various new facts have emerged at present, and the most important of them is Germany's request to immediately reorganize the disarmament plan in quality and quantity. Massigli said that Germany's reply to France on March 13 of this year, on the one hand, requested permission for Germany to immediately reorganize its armaments, and on the other hand, requested other countries to reduce their armaments. This attitude is inevitably contradictory. Massigli believed that Germany's proposal was tantamount to fundamentally overturning the basis of the discussions at the Disarmament Conference, and if this was to be done, the General Commission must be convened to vote on it, because only the General Commission has the power to decide whether the principles on which the Disarmament Conference has been based in the past should be abandoned. Massigli then said that Germany is actually engaged in reorganizing its armaments, so the question remains as to how much the difference between its demands and the actual situation of its armaments is. The French representative continued that the British government is working hard to study the issue of guarantees for the implementation of the disarmament convention in order to make it clearer. The French government is very grateful and firmly believes that it will soon be able to agree with London to find a solution. Massigli concluded by saying that the French government will do its best to bring about a general conclusion to the situation as soon as possible so that it can report to the Disarmament Conference. 5) Swedish Foreign Minister Sandtler, Swiss representative Motta, and Polish representative Lecinski spoke one after another, all hoping to obtain concrete results. Sandtler especially advocated three points, namely (a) substantive disarmament, (b) appropriate implementation of the ○ principle of equality in disarmament, and (c) the establishment of new security guarantees. Motta said that he believes that Germany must be ordered to return to Geneva, because without Germany, the disarmament convention cannot be discussed in spirit. Lecinski agreed with the French representative's opinion. (Havas dispatch on the 10th)</p>

<p>(London) Britain and Germany are currently engaged in secret negotiations to discuss the relocation of eighteen major German textile factories to Britain. This is a rare migration movement in recent years. It is said that Germany's policy of mistreating Jews has sparked a global boycott of the National Socialist Party and German-produced goods. Moreover, German manufacturers are unable to purchase foreign currency for exchanging foreign-produced raw materials. Consequently, the idea of relocating factories has emerged. Representatives of German industrialists are currently selecting factory sites in Britain and hope that the British government will approve the relocation. The factories involved in the relocation primarily manufacture women's clothing, and their total foreign trade amounts to approximately two million marks annually. Recently, due to the boycott of the National Socialist Party by various countries, they have suffered a severe decline. German manufacturers firmly believe that the "Made in Britain" label will avoid foreign boycotts and enable German foreign trade to recover. The German government has unexpectedly expressed approval, believing that this is the only solution for rescuing the factories in question. Managers of the factories involved have promised the German government to purchase a certain amount of raw materials from Germany annually and transport them to British factories for manufacturing. It is said that if the relocation continues unchanged and the outcome is successful, other German factories will follow suit, not just in the textile industry. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>

The tax rates range up to 20% ad valorem, and some weigh over three yuan per item. The names of these fees are constantly changing, and inspection points are everywhere, which is no different from disguised likin.

<p>Nanjing: At the request of Chinese flour mills, the Ministry of Finance has established three principles for refunding the original wheat import tax on exported flour: 1. The amount of the tax refund is limited to the amount of import tax actually paid by the flour mill for foreign wheat. 2. The percentage of Chinese and foreign wheat used by manufacturers to produce flour is not uniform. After wheat is made into flour, its form is completely changed, and it is impossible to distinguish between Chinese and foreign wheat. The submitted wheat import certificates can be approved for tax refund to facilitate customs enforcement. Due to the special preferential treatment of Chinese wheat, its sales can also be promoted. However, the tax refund should be reduced by 20% as compensation for tax refund procedures. 3. The tax refund will not be issued in cash but in the form of wheat tax payment certificates, which can only be used to offset wheat import taxes. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>New York: Today (the 11th), New York securities prices rose slightly. The anticipation of major changes to the Securities Exchange Act is currently quite exciting, and commercial statistics and silver development have also stimulated speculative sentiment, but there is still no aggressive momentum for advancement. After the opening, the market situation was calm, and a slight upward trend began to unfold, but merchants are still mostly observing.

<h3 id="e105">An Inspection Tour of Xinjiang by Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Route to Xinjiang</p>
<p>While waiting for internal permits in Pingyin, and after receiving a reply telegram from Xinjiang Province, I stayed for several days and visited Commissioner Zhu Jiqing, Chairman Song Zheyuan, and Director of Civil Affairs Qin Dechun, as well as several gentlemen from the press, Zhao Ximeng, Xu Maoxian, and Lang Xiaocang, and from the education sector, Chen Zhongyi, Wang Youdao, and Luo Ming. The main points of our discussions were: (1) The Japanese are implementing their Tanaka Doctrine thoroughly. The Northeast has already been seized, and the situation between Japan and Russia is tense again. The situation in North China is becoming increasingly dangerous. We lack strength and are finding it difficult to cope. (2) Given China's current situation, no matter from which perspective we view it, developing the Northwest is a crucial task. The sooner it is implemented, the better, as further delays may be irredeemable.</p>
<p>The Hui people of Gansu account for about half of the province's population. In Xinjiang Province, the Hui people make up 70 to 80 percent of the population. Before entering Xinjiang, I inquired about their customs. I specifically visited the "China Islamic Advancement Association" and met with Mr. Li Yunting and Mr. Ma Xingdong, the secretary of the Turkish Embassy.</p>
<p>They briefly stated, "In China's current precarious situation, the genuine cooperation of all five ethnic groups is barely enough to save the country. If they continue to harbor doubts and dissent, the future will be even more bleak." Mr. Xingdong, with his enthusiasm and sincerity, introduced me to Mr. Ma Songting, the principal of the Chen Da Normal School, who briefly explained the school's purpose and history: "Our school's purpose is to cultivate healthy teachers and promote Islam (the Hui religion). The expenses are covered by the board of directors' fundraising and we do not charge for board, lodging, or tuition. The reason for its establishment is that we, the same-minded people, realized the decline of our religion. Considering that we want to develop the religious teachings and improve the status of our religious people, we must first cultivate healthy teachers, organize the temple administration, and awaken the religious people. It is not enough to plan the overall progress of our Islamic nation. Therefore, we founded our school in Jinan in 1925, adopting the three-three system of normal schools, and started enrolling students. During this period, it was suspended twice due to the May 3rd Massacre, etc. After the same-minded people worked hard and with the strong support of Mr. Ma Hongkui, etc., school affairs were restored and developed daily. In 1929, the school site was moved to Beiping." Afterwards, I visited the auditorium, lecture hall, and dormitory, all of which were quite clean and tidy.</p>
<p>The most convenient route to Xinjiang is to take a plane from Beijing, via Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Hami, to Dihua, which takes three days and costs about 2,000 yuan. The next is to take the Xin-Sui long-distance bus from Ping to Sui, via Ulan Ali Gen, Hami, and Guchengzi, to Dihua. The entire line is 5,980 li (2,917 kilometers), takes 14 days, and costs 335 yuan. Food and lodging are provided by the bus. This road was originally a trade route, and it passes through hard Gobi deserts. Even if there is light sand, it is easy to handle. The road is flat and easy to travel, and it is quite appropriate to reconstruct it as a highway. Mule and camel transport takes at least 70 days (from Ping to Dihua). Supplies are difficult to obtain along the way, so the cost is lower than bus transport. The third route is to take the Siberian Railway. Currently, it is not possible to go directly from the Northeast. You must take a ship via Japan (because there are very few ships from Tianjin directly to Vladivostok), transfer to Vladivostok, and then take a train to Aigun, transfer to a bus, enter Tacheng, and reach Dihua, which takes more than 40 days and costs more than 400 yuan. The fourth route is to take the Longhai Railway, via Shaanxi, Gansu, and Hami, to Dihua, which takes about 80 days. From Hami to Dihua, if you do not take a car and walk with camels, it takes 20 days. In the winter and spring seasons, the climate is severely cold, so the</p>
<p>Southern route of Tianshan is taken, via Shanshan and Turpan. In the summer and autumn, the northern route of Tianshan is taken, passing through Muleihe and Qitai to reach Dihua. I do not wish to take the above routes by plane or detour through Siberia. The Xin-Sui long-distance bus has no buses going recently. In order to make a more detailed inspection along the way, I decided to take the Ping-Sui Railway to Baotou, transfer to Ningxia, and insert into the fourth route, and first detour to Qinghai before entering Xinjiang.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Japanese Control of the Northeast Railway Establishes Four Management Bureaus <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Important officials announced amidst reorganization, divided into six sections, fifteen departments, and forty-one units.</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: The Japanese built railways in the Northeast, completing the railway network, in order to facilitate military transportation and to defend against Russia and eliminate the Volunteer Army. However, although the railway network is completed, the internal organization is even more important. Therefore, the Japanese implemented a plan to control the Northeast Railway, adopting a four-bureau management system, dividing regions and allocating duties. It has been implemented since April 1st. The detailed organization and newly announced important personnel are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Bandit Liu Breaks Through and Flees into Ju County <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Most Fleeing Towards Fengshan</p>
<p>A Small Number Returning Near Xia Village</p>
<p>Seemingly Still Trying to Flee into Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The remnants of Liu Guitang's bandits were heavily surrounded yesterday in the areas of Xiatangzhuang, Jiangyu, and Sijiaoquan in Yishui County. Realizing that the various suppression forces were gathering, the bandits desperately broke out in an attempt to escape. Yesterday, they first planned to break out from the north of Yanziyu, but were repelled by Sun Tongxuan's troops of the 20th Division, suffering considerable losses. Around 7:00 PM, as darkness fell and visibility was poor, the bandits merged a small force from Sijiaoquan into one unit, and broke through to the south with all their might. The southern side was met by Xie Shuxian's Lu Southern militia, but the bandits were extremely fierce, advancing one after another without retreating. Xie's militia were ultimately weaker than the regular army, and were broken through, with the bandits spilling blood and fleeing south. They passed through Xiangluzi Cliff, Fengjia Cliff, Longhu Ridge, Gao Ridge, Baijia Ridge, and Zhangzhuangzi to Luyouzhuang, fleeing overnight without stopping. Today (the 9th) at 11:00 AM, headquarters received a report from Zhaoxian Town that the bandits had crossed Yishui, turned east, and entered Ju County. Because they suffered heavy losses during the breakout, heavy objects were discarded everywhere as they fled in panic. At 8:00 AM, they arrived at Luozhuzhuang, and then fled southeast to Xinlipu, reaching Tiandiling (40 li from Ju County). As of 4:00 PM this afternoon, headquarters continued to receive reports that the bandits had passed Mulishui from San Shili Pu and turned north again, heading for Li Ziwang (north of Zhaoxian Town). Currently, Ma Guanyi's brigade is in pursuit, and other units are also blocking them from all sides.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: After the bandits broke out, they passed near Majia Cliff, Weizao Hutong, and Tangjia River, stealing and breaking through heavy encirclement, and fleeing into the territory of Ju County overnight. They passed through the south of Zheshui City for thirty to forty li, passing through Hushang, Huangshan, Zhujialou, Taipingzhuang, Yaodianzi, Daqiaopozizhuang, Qianchengzi Wujiazhuang, Zhujiazhuang, Miaojiazhuang, Chengziji Quanliguanzhuang, Yuanjiazhuang Anzi, Xiajiaqiao Liujiazhuang, Nanshezhuang, Qiuzhuang, all the way to the Simadianzi area, which is directly south of Yishui City. The bandits were divided into two groups, the large group fled northeast from the south of Yongshan (south of Yishui City), entered the central part of Ju County, passed Wangjial, Duwa, Yinglingshan, Liuling, along the south of the Yellow River, passed Mazhuang Xiaowo, Lijiazhuang, Hujiazhuang, Mazhuang, Jialaiwang Lianzi Hutong, Huliugou, Yujiahe, Zhang Haizi Hou Kezhuang, Daguanzhuang, Jiaojiazhuang, Kangguan, passed Xueshan, passed Shang Yai Xia Yai, Huiquan Shankou, Zhujia Gou, to Luozhuzhuang, thirty-odd li north of Ju County City, at 8:00 AM yesterday (the 9th), and again passed through the front and rear Si Dun, Zhangzhuang, Sunkongzhuang, Qiuguazhuang, Beiwenzhuang, Zhoujiazhuang, Suguanzhuang, crossed the Shuh River, and then passed through Hedongzhuang, Jiajiazhuang, Lujiazhuang, Shiluguanzhuang, and had already reached Maopu Town by noon. In the afternoon, they fled northeast again, passing through Fengjiapo, Chenguantou, Donghaizhuang, and at 3:00 PM, they were in the areas of Ligou, Yongjin Temple, Haizhuang, Yuezhuang, Yinjia Guanzhuang, and Suguanzhuang, still fleeing northeast toward Fengshan. A small group fled southeast from Simadianzi in the west of Yishui County, returned to Zhujiazhuang, Linjiazhuang, and Xinglongdian, and after arriving at Sucun at 8:00 AM, fled southeast again, passed Yunshan Shengmuzong, and had returned to the vicinity of Xiazhuang south of Ju County City by noon, still fleeing east. The current goal of the Liu bandits still seems to be to flee into Jiangsu Province again. After the Liu bandits escaped, the suppression troops were ordered to pursue and suppress them overnight. Chairman Han Fuqu also ordered Gao Lantian's department, the 172nd regiment of the 86th brigade of the 29th division stationed in Jiaozhou, to proceed to Zhucheng in preparation for blocking the bandits.</p>
<p>According to the news obtained last night (the 9th), Ma Guanyi's brigade had arrived in Yishui, Li Xuande's cavalry regiment had arrived south of Sucun, Sun Tongxuan's division had arrived in Linyi, and Gu Liangmin's division's direct teams had also arrived in Linyi, while Xue's regiment arrived in Xiazhuang and Tian's regiment arrived in Tangtou Town. It is heard that Han believes that the Lunan area is all mountains, and the Liu bandits are extremely cunning, making encirclement and suppression difficult. He intends to change the plan, only dispatching considerable troops to pursue and suppress them, and deploying heavy troops in key passes between Linyi, Ju County, Yishui, Zhucheng, Rizhao, and Mengyin, to meet and suppress them everywhere, waiting at leisure to quickly eliminate them.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Measures in Guangdong Province to Maintain Paper Currency <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong Provincial Bank's paper currency has been experiencing a low discount trend for several months now. Although the Provincial Bank has stopped exchanging ten-yuan banknotes and adopted measures to seal up shop rental income to reduce the circulation of paper currency in the market, the shop rental income sealed up a month ago has reached its term and has been unsealed one after another. The symptomatic methods of maintaining the paper currency have come to an end, and the one-yuan and five-yuan silver banknotes have still not returned to full circulation. At the same time, some silver industry market brokers are taking this opportunity to openly trade, with different market prices every day. The value of one-yuan and five-yuan silver banknotes is often between ninety percent. The wages earned by the middle and lower-class people through hard work are invisibly reduced to ninety percent each month. On the merchants' side, unwilling to suffer the loss of low discounts, they have to raise prices to compensate for the low discounts on paper currency. The suffering is all transferred to the general public, and the poor are especially affected. Recently, the authorities have seen this and have been discussing ways to maintain the situation for several days. It has been decided to borrow from large merchants in the province and raise 5 million yuan in cash so that the Provincial Bank can fully exchange paper currency as much as possible. On the one hand, silver shops are prohibited from opening to buy and sell. With no one manipulating the market and the Provincial Bank resuming full exchange, it would not be difficult for the discounted paper currency to immediately restore its full value. This is a fundamental maintenance measure. It is understood that the procedures for borrowing a large sum of money are currently being negotiated separately. It is planned to temporarily borrow 1.5 million yuan from tobacco merchants, 1.5 million yuan from a certain merchant, and another 2 million yuan from the prize-winning association contractor as a reserve. As for the 3 million yuan borrowed from the above two merchants, it will be guaranteed by additional tax revenues and increased agricultural taxes, to be repaid within the year. The Provincial Bank will provide interest at the ordinary rate. As for the 5 million yuan borrowed, it will be allowed to be delivered in paper currency. According to Provincial Bank staff, the paper currency currently circulating in the market is no more than 13 million yuan. If the Provincial Bank borrows 5 million yuan in paper currency, then there will only be about 7 million yuan of paper currency remaining in the market. With such a sudden decrease in the amount of paper currency on the market, the restoration of the original value of the paper currency can be realized immediately. As for the government's future repayment of the loans, it is reported that there are already concrete measures in place. The so-called additional tax revenue can increase revenue by about 900,000 yuan per month, and at least 700,000 yuan. In addition, increasing agricultural taxes can increase revenue by 400,000 yuan per month, totaling over 1.2 million yuan per month. Within four months, there will be over 5 million yuan to repay the creditor merchants, which is more than enough. Currently, there is already some progress on this matter. If there are no unexpected obstacles, a loan contract will be signed with the merchants, and the Provincial Bank's paper currency can begin to be fully exchanged at the same time. (April 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e116">Feng Yuxiang's Difficult Situation <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Central Government Has Subsidized Him Three Times with 50,000 Yuan</p>
<p>More Than a Thousand Guards Returned to Han Fuqu for Maintenance</p>
<p>Tai'an Correspondence: Commissioner Feng Yuxiang has lived in Tai'an since he left Chahar in August of last year and settled in Shandong again, and it has been more than half a year. He lives by reading and practicing calligraphy every day, and his attitude is quite passive. However, his economic situation is extremely difficult. In the past, Committee Member Huang (郛) had subsidized Feng Yuxiang's living expenses three times for 50,000 yuan. The first time was 20,000 yuan, the second time was also 20,000 yuan, and the third time was 10,000 yuan. In addition, Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu and Chahar Chairman Song Zheyuan provided occasional subsidies. However, Feng's guards in Tai'an still number one to two thousand, and the food costs are high, so he really feels unable to maintain them. Therefore, recently the soldiers only have food to eat, and the officers only receive subsidies of 10 yuan. The poor situation can be imagined. In early December of last year, Feng telegraphed Chahar Province Chairman Song Zheyuan, willing to return the guards to Chahar Province. Subsequently, Liu Ruming, the former division commander of the Northwest Army, was sent to Lu to take them back, preparing to lead Feng's guards back to Chahar. However, Feng's guards resolutely refused to leave Feng, so it could not be realized. Recently, Feng, still unable to secure the guards' salaries, sent Ming Zhexi and Li Xin to Jinan to meet with Chairman Han Fuqu, requesting that more than a thousand guards be handed over to the Third Route Army for all maintenance. Han Fuqu had no choice but to agree, and it is heard that he has agreed to temporarily have Wu Huawen, the brigade commander of the pistol brigade, maintain the status quo of Feng's guards. Approximately within days, he will send personnel to Tai'an to inspect them, and all military salaries will be temporarily subsidized by the Third Central Army. (7th)</p>

<p>The Yuanbei small steamer, which travels between Suzhou City and Dongting West Mountain, left Suzhou for West Mountain on the 8th. When it arrived at the Wangmu Gate of Taihu Lake at about 4:00 PM, the wind and waves were very strong. A ferryboat towed behind the steamer was in great danger. Seven passengers on the ferryboat boarded the steamer one after another to take shelter from the wind. At this time, the ferryboat was overturned by the wind. The boat owner, Zhou Zhaoda, and his wife, Yao, both fell into the river. Fortunately, Zhou Zhaoda was good at swimming and escaped unharmed. After Yao fell into the river, the gale was even stronger, and she tragically drowned. The body was also swept away by the waves. Efforts were made to salvage the body, but no trace was found.</p>

<p>Gu Gengquan, a villager from Huangdai Township, brought vegetables to the city to sell the day before yesterday. On his way back to the township at 11:50 PM, he encountered more than 20 bandits at Feijiawei in Huangdai. They were divided into three small boats and blocked him to rob him. Because Gu refused to hand over the hidden silver, he was slashed in the back with a knife. The bandits then fled towards Suzhou.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Questioning of Civil Affairs Department Staff in the Gu Case <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Since the incident of Liu Zhuomin's refusal to hand over the case, involving Li Shuyun, the wife of former Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Gu Renfa, and leading to various cases of Gu Renfa's bigamy and fraudulent marriage, as well as Gu Renfa's resignation due to his self-awareness of unease in his position, etc., have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the County Court Procuratorate recently ordered the summoning of Zeng Fanrong (Binqiu, Sichuan), an inspector of the Civil Affairs Department, Hao Ruyuan (Shanxi), an accountant, and Huang Xutan, the director of Junhe Firm, for interrogation. Yesterday was the court date for this case. Only Zeng and Hao appeared as summoned, while Huang Xutan remained absent. At 2 p.m., Chief Judge Qian opened the court, and the questioning was extremely simple. First, Zeng was asked whether a woman surnamed Li had come to the Civil Affairs Department around March 20th to see Gu Renfa, and whether he had arranged the meeting. Zeng testified that he had arranged the meeting, and that Li came because she wanted to seek a position. Next, Hao Ruyuan was questioned whether a long-distance phone call from Nanjing to the Civil Affairs Department at the end of March was received by him. Hao testified that it was. After the interrogation, they were both ordered to return home. As for Gu Renfa himself, Chief Judge Qian, considering his failure to appear after being summoned twice, which constituted contempt of court, has decided to issue a third summons, ensuring that he appears in court for questioning. According to Hao Ruyuan's statement to reporters, Gu Renfa's personal seal was hung on his belt year-round, never leaving his person. Therefore, the Gu Renfa private seal found on the stationery of the Provincial Residence in Liu Zhuomin's luggage must be a forgery. From this, it can be seen that Gu Renfa's accusation that Li Shuyun stole his seal and sold official positions is also impossible. Furthermore, Mr. Hao also said that the newspaper's reports were mostly based on Li Shuyun's one-sided statements, because Gu Renfa had not treated Li Shuyun unfairly. When Shuyun was in Zhenjiang, Gu had given her 300 yuan per month for living expenses, and so on. It is also heard that this matter initially arose from a misunderstanding. When the Liu Zhuomin case broke out, Liu's wife, Wen Rongzhen, publicly claimed to be like sisters with Li Shuyun, seemingly unafraid. After receiving a report, Chen Guofu, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, believed that Li Shuyun's interference in administrative affairs was a disgrace to official conduct. Therefore, he sent a secret telegram to Gu Renfa, who was in Jiangxi for training, roughly saying, "You should ask your family elder to strictly discipline her, and not let her run around everywhere." Upon receiving the telegram, Gu immediately became angry and telegraphed Chairman Chen, requesting punishment for himself, and ordering his subordinates in the Civil Affairs Department to bring Li back to Zhenjiang for control. Initially, there was no intention to send her and her daughter to the judiciary for interrogation. However, a close confidant of Gu Renfa dispatched by the Civil Affairs Department, named Mr. Zhang Si, hoping to gain great merit, misunderstood Gu's intentions and mobilized a large number of troops, alarming the police and sending them to the court, which made it impossible to bring them back for control, and the case also expanded. Yesterday, Li Wenhui, Li Shuyun's uncle, came to Wuxi to collect the items sent by Shuyun from the detention center. According to talks, external rumors of reconciliation with Gu were strongly denied by Shuyun, whose attitude was resolute. Regarding the accusation of Gu's bigamy, it will be decided after careful consideration after Shuyun recovers from her illness.</p>

<p>Zhuang Caibao, a wealthy household in Xican Township, the fifth district, has considerable wealth and was coveted by bandits. More than 20 bandits suddenly came the day before yesterday, armed with guns, sticks, and other weapons, to rob the Zhuang family. At that time, Zhuang and others were asleep and were all dragged up, and asked about the whereabouts of the silver. Zhuang's wife, Li, and his elderly mother were all beaten by the bandits. They then arbitrarily searched and robbed for two hours before leaving. As a result, they lost approximately 4,000 yuan in cash, clothing, and jewelry. The next day, the incident was reported to the Public Security Bureau, and the detective team went to the countryside on the morning of the 10th for an on-site investigation. It has now been reported to the county, and the county government has now ordered the four injured Zhuang family members to go to the county for injury examination, in order to confront them after the case is solved in the future.</p>

<p>The central government has long intended to abolish the Huaibei salt ticket, but after efforts by the transport merchants to save it, it has not been realized until now. Recently, it was heard that Miao Qiujie, the transport envoy of Lianghuai, suggested to the central government, and the Ministry of Finance decided to approve the abolition. This news, when it reached the ticket holders in Yangzhou, was like a bolt from the blue, causing extreme panic. They are now gathering to discuss relief methods, intending to petition the central government to withdraw the order, in order to maintain their capital and avoid unemployment. However, if the abolition of tickets is implemented, it will not only affect the livelihoods of the ticket merchants, but also affect all circles in Yangzhou.</p>

<p>The home of Xu Yougui, a farmer in Sunjiazhuang, Ping'an Township, the second district, was coveted by bandits because he had sold a batch of rice grains the day before yesterday. That night, they went to Xu's house to search and rob, obtaining only ten or so yuan. The bandits then forced Xu to hand over the remaining money. Xu refused to the end, which angered the bandits, who tied him up and tortured him, and stabbed his face several times with sharp blades. They then split up to search for two hours, and it is estimated that they robbed him of several hundred yuan worth of rice money and gold jewelry. However, Xu's injuries are quite serious, and there is fear for his life.</p>

<p>Xi Tongfa, a villager in Baoshan Township, the first district, hid elsewhere last year to avoid conscription. Zhang Guirong, a clerk in the Judicial Office of the county government, learned of this and, posing as a trainer from the First District Regiment Department, went to Xi Tongfa to threaten him, saying that he needed to pay 60 yuan to avoid conscription. After repeated pleas, the amount was reduced to 35 yuan, and 20 yuan was paid. Later, another 7 yuan was paid, leaving 8 yuan unpaid. Unexpectedly, the First District Regiment Department recently learned of this matter. After verification, it was found to be true, and a report was submitted to the county government for investigation. County Magistrate Zhang was greatly angered by the report and issued a handwritten order yesterday (the 8th), suspending Zhang Guirong from his duties and placing him under surveillance for strict investigation.</p>

<p>The County Chamber of Commerce of this county, jointly with Ni Shuxiang, a resident of the border of Suzhou, and Shen Xiaoguan, a farmer of Xitang, reported that the Sixth Branch of the Ship Management Office stationed in the third district illegally levied donations, causing constant harm to farmers. For example, when Ni Shuxiang used his own farm boat to carry a sick person to Shan for medical treatment last month, it was already dusk. Suddenly, someone in uniform shouted to stop the boat and went straight into the boat. At first, he said to donate five yuan, nine jiao, and nine fen. After Ni and others begged bitterly, he said he would reduce it by one yuan. After begging again, he said three yuan, nine jiao, and nine fen was the minimum amount. The boatman and the sick person in the boat had a total of three people, carrying only about two yuan, which was only for medical expenses and food. They had no choice but to pay him everything. He still detained the boat and did not release it, forcing them to mortgage the cotton quilt to a shop, paying a total of three yuan and two jiao and four fen, before giving them four licenses, and saying that there were still seven jiao and five fen missing. After paying it off, two boat plates were given. After checking, the four licenses stated a total of three yuan, three jiao, and one fen. After paying the amount, there were still seven fen missing, and they even detained the boat plate and forced them to pay seven jiao and five fen, causing Ni Shuxiang and others on the boat to be hungry and cold, in extreme suffering, forcing them to mortgage the cotton quilt, showing no compassion for the sick person, which was even more inhumane. Not only do farmers directly suffer from it, but merchants also indirectly suffer from it. After receiving the report, the County Chamber of Commerce immediately forwarded it to the Construction Department. It is now learned that the Construction Department has clearly ordered the county to investigate and prohibit it.</p>

<p>Since Shandong Province suffered a major flood last year, the counties in western Shandong have not yet recovered from the damage. Therefore, the province is taking the Yellow River's spring dyke repair project within the province very seriously this year. The provincial government had previously decided to allocate 300,000 yuan to fund the spring dyke repair. The upstream levee has not seen water for many years, and the levee body is extremely weak. The River Affairs Bureau is paying close attention to this area for this year's spring dyke repair. Pan Yifen, the chief of the engineering section of the bureau, went to the area to survey and supervise the work and returned to Jinan today. According to Pan's statement, the project of adding grass and thickening the entire levee is extremely important and is currently underway, which is expected to be completed in about May. In addition, there are many places in the middle reaches where the local dykes and dams are damaged, and there are many places in the downstream reaches where the dykes and dams need to be repaired. He must inspect and supervise the repair one by one to ensure that it is completed before the major flood to resist the flood.</p>

<p>The Capitalist Side Should Also Not Engage in Abuse</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports, the Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Command announced yesterday, "This city is an important industrial and commercial area, and labor-capital disputes occur from time to time, which is detrimental to the future of industry. Moreover, at a time of national crisis, the entire country should unite and strive to produce and enrich national strength. If the labor and capital sides are allowed to have conflicts from time to time, it will not only reduce the country's due production but also endanger social order, which is a disaster. The duty of this command is to maintain the locality. For this reason, it is announced to all industrial and commercial people that the labor and capital sides share prosperity and adversity and are closely related. Factory owners should usually care for workers and not allow abuse, etc., and workers should work hard for their factories and should not arbitrarily slow down or strike to coerce factory owners, etc. Only in this way can both sides coordinate and expect good results in the process of industrial development. Recently, an order has been received from Chairman Chiang that if factories in various places arbitrarily strike or slow down in the future, the local competent authorities shall strictly prohibit them. If the workers who caused the above-mentioned unrest have a union, the competent authorities may also check the provisions of item 3 of Article 37 of the Trade Union Law and first order the trade union to be dissolved so that the unrest can be resolved quickly. This is an unprecedented example during the national crisis. As for the factory owners, they should not abuse the workers, and the competent authorities should pay special attention at any time and correct them in order to eliminate the invisible, etc. This command has the responsibility and will abide by the previous order if the above-mentioned situation occurs. It is hoped that the industrial and commercial people of this city will take the heart of mutual assistance and the policy of common prosperity, and unite to increase production and enrich national strength. This is our earnest expectation." This announcement is by Commander Wu Tiecheng.</p>

<p>Dagon News Agency reports that for many years, Chinese-owned yarn mills have borrowed money from the banking community to maintain their operations due to poor business conditions. However, according to the current situation, Chinese-owned yarn mills may not be able to repay the loans from the banking community as scheduled. According to people in the yarn industry, the latest situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The recession of Chinese-owned yarn mills</p>
<p>Due to poor business conditions and more than half of the capital losses, the Chinese-owned yarn mills in this city had no choice but to mortgage the factory and borrow a large amount of money from the banking community, totaling 120 million yuan. After borrowing this money, it was used to revitalize the yarn mill, but recently, due to the impact of the global economic recession, it has been impossible to repay this debt, so many yarn mills are said to be transferred to the management of the banking community. The Japanese are taking the opportunity to seize the management rights of the factory.</p>
<p>The banking community's investment in Chinese-owned yarn mills is purely to develop China's industry and relieve unemployed workers, but recently it has reached such a point that they have to think of other ways to recover this loan. However, the banking community are all laymen when it comes to managing yarn mills, so recently the Japanese have been actively engaged in negotiating with the banking community to have Japanese personnel serve as managers of the factory, but whether it can become a reality is still a question. The banks that invested in Chinese-owned yarn mills are the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Ningpo Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and other banks.</p>

<p>Because no one has introduced Rogers after arriving in Shanghai, he has not yet met with the banking community and chambers of commerce, etc. It is now learned that Finance Minister Kung telegraphed Shanghai yesterday, asking people to prepare a tea party to be held at his residence on Avenue Petain in the French Concession on the afternoon of the 14th to entertain Rogers and important figures from the Chinese and foreign banking and business circles in Shanghai, introducing both parties. The banking community will formally meet with Rogers after being introduced by Kung. The authorities denied the rumors that banking figures Bei Songsun, Xu Jiping, etc. would host a banquet to entertain Rogers in the next two or three days. As for the US community in Shanghai hosting a banquet for Rogers, the reporter of New Voice asked Rogers himself yesterday, who also said that there were no banquets. Even the banquet of the US Consul General Kincaid was suspended due to Kincaid's grief over the death of his wife.</p>
<p>Setting Up an Office</p>
<p>Because Rogers needs to stay in China for more than a month, it is inconvenient to work in a hotel. Therefore, a temporary office has been set up in the US Consulate General on Jiujiang Road and Jiangxi Road on the third floor, in the office building of the US Embassy, in order to facilitate contact with all parties. Therefore, Rogers went to the office with his secretaries Randman and Ichi Arnod at about 9 am yesterday. All matters of contact with Chinese and foreign parties have been changed to be handled there. The telephone</p>
<p>The telephone in the US Consulate General is also used.</p>
<h3 id="e138">After the Disappearance of the Sikorsky Aircraft, Search and Rescue Efforts Launched by Land, Sea, and Air; No Concrete Leads Found as of 7 PM; Not Entirely Giving Up Hope, Search Continues <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that the China National Aviation Corporation's Sikorsky aircraft, which departed for Guangzhou early the previous morning, suddenly went missing. Since yesterday morning, the company has dispatched personnel in three directions – land, sea, and air – to conduct simultaneous and intensive searches. Due to continued adverse weather conditions, as of 7 PM yesterday, according to reports from various sources, the aircraft had still not been located. General speculation suggests that the aircraft's fate is likely more ill-fated than fortunate. Currently, the company is continuing its efforts to search and rescue. The Shen Shi News Agency reporter has learned the following details:</p>
<p>Search and Rescue Efforts Launched by Land, Sea, and Air</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Guangzhou route's number 16 Sikorsky aircraft departed at 7 AM the previous morning. Half an hour later, it was declared missing. On the same day, the China National Aviation Corporation dispatched aircraft twice for searching, but to no avail. Starting yesterday morning, they dispatched personnel in three directions – land, sea, and air – to conduct search and rescue efforts. (1) The company dispatched staff members Wang Heling, Yao Qinru, etc., who hired a car from Shanghai to travel along the Minhang long-distance route to the Xiapu area for detailed inquiries. (2) The company dispatched Nie Kaiyi, deputy director of the flight crew, along with Wang Chengming, a staff member of the crew, who took a Jianghai Customs steamer from the Huangpu River and searched along the Huangpu River towards Wusongkou, splitting up along the way. (3) At noon yesterday, when the heavy fog slightly dissipated, they dispatched two aircraft, a Lockheed and a Sikorsky, which departed one after another at 12:30 PM to search southwards.</p>
<p>Search Yields No Trace</p>
<p>The customs steamer departed at 12 PM and arrived at Hangzhou Bay at 5 PM. According to a telegram to the company, they found no trace of the aircraft along the way. The land personnel had not reported any news as of 6 PM. These personnel will not return to Shanghai until there is a result, in order to continue the detailed search along the way. The dispatched aircraft sent a telegram to the company at around 7 PM, stating that they had also not seen any trace of the aircraft. The aircraft will spend the night in the Xisha Islands and will continue searching early this morning, and requested that another aircraft be dispatched to assist in the search. The company and the families of the pilots are extremely anxious. However, according to pilots who returned to Shanghai after the search, the aircraft may have landed on the sea surface. If there are no further results, a warship will be dispatched to search the sea surface. The pilots and passengers on board the aircraft are:</p>
<p>According to the China National Aviation Corporation's announcement, the missing aircraft included two American pilots: the main pilot, Robert L. Gest, and the co-pilot, Jamos Finek. Finek had only been in Shanghai for two months. In addition, there was one passenger, a manager of a certain Japanese export trading company, who was flying to Fuzhou on the aircraft. Yesterday, Manager Dai of the company told a Shen Shi News Agency reporter that, regarding this aircraft's disappearance, the company, as its duty lies, will make its greatest efforts to search for its whereabouts. If it is not found in one day, the search will not be abandoned for a single day. A detailed report has now been sent to the ministry.</p>

<h3 id="e139">American-Asiatic Factory Workers Surround the Social Affairs Bureau, Police Dispatched Yesterday to Disperse Them; Leading Trouble-Making Workers Detained and Sent to Police Headquarters for Interrogation; Party and Government Jointly Issue a Proclamation Ordering Workers to Resume Work; Factory to Comply with Orders and Resume Operations Normally Starting This Morning; Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Issues a Letter to American-Asiatic Factory Workers <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>All workers of the American-Asiatic Silk Weaving Factory went on strike to protest the factory's reduction of wages. The Social Affairs Bureau convened both parties for mediation the day before yesterday, but failed. All workers went to the Social Affairs Bureau one after another starting at 1 PM, ostensibly to petition, but in reality surrounded the bureau. They did not disperse the whole night before last. It was not until yesterday noon that the Security Department and the Public Security Bureau jointly dispatched police to disperse them, and arrested eleven leading workers who were stirring up trouble, sending them to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. Party and government organs issued a joint</p>
<p>proclamation, ordering the workers to resume work. The Silk Weavers' Federation of Trade Unions also issued a letter to the American-Asiatic workers, urging them to resume work and await a resolution. The details of each item are recorded below:</p>
<p>Petitioning Workers Dispersed by Police</p>
<p>All workers of the American-Asiatic Factory went to the Social Affairs Bureau in the city center one after another to petition, starting at 1 PM the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>The number of people reached five or six hundred. They put forward two demands: (1) Maintain workers' meals; (2) Stop reducing wages. Xu Yefu of the Social Affairs Bureau, together with Long Peiyun, a representative of the Municipal Party Committee, and Wang Guoxian, a representative of the Public Security Bureau, persuaded the crowd and expressed acceptance of the requests. However, the workers insisted on an immediate resolution and refused to leave, surrounding the doors of the Social Education Bureau and the Hygiene Bureau, preventing bureau staff from entering and leaving. Extending until the evening, the workers gathered in increasing numbers, reaching more than two thousand by about 11 PM the night before last. They still did not disperse until dawn, and shouted slogans, intending to break into the bureau and carry out destruction. Mayor Wu, upon receiving the report, believed that the workers dared to cause trouble by gathering a crowd and surrounding government offices, which clearly indicated that there were reactionary elements instigating them. He immediately ordered the Security Department and the Public Security Bureau to dispatch police to disperse them. Director Yang and Director Wen, upon receiving the order, immediately ordered the police brigade's third squadron, led by He An, and soldiers, all carrying bamboo poles, and prepared two fire trucks, to rush to the city center at 8 AM yesterday to disperse the workers. Because there were many workers, the order was disrupted for a while, and several people were squeezed and injured. Among them, two women and one man were seriously injured and were immediately sent to the Hygiene Bureau for treatment. It was not until about 11 AM that the workers gradually dispersed. Bureau staff, who had been surrounded for a day and a night, were finally able to go out, and were all exhausted.</p>
<p>Leading Trouble-Making Workers Detained and Sent to Police Headquarters</p>
<p>Mayor Wu believed that the workers dared to cause trouble by gathering a crowd, which was obviously disrupting public order and was close to being reactionary. In addition to ordering the Security Department and the Public Security Bureau to dispatch police to disperse them, he also ordered the Seventh District's Second Precinct to detain eleven worker representatives who were stirring up trouble. After being sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation, they were immediately transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for legal proceedings. Their names are as follows: Huang Baofu, Cai Shoufu (Factory 1), Feng Xianchun (Factory 2), Xia Zhiwei (Factory 3), Lü Haiquan (Factory 4), female worker Zhu Linchai (Factory 5), Cai Hangsong (Factory 6), He Yayun (Factory 7), Tong Chunqi (Factory 8), female worker Liu Yanqing (Factory 9), Pan Yuancai (Factory 10).</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Issues Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>Mayor Wu, regarding the American-Asiatic Silk Weaving Factory workers' petition at the Social Affairs Bureau the day before yesterday, which did not disperse overnight, believed that the actions were excessive and disregarded the law. He specifically issued a statement yesterday, saying that after the dispute occurred at the American-Asiatic Silk Weaving Factory, the municipal government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate the truth and, together with the Municipal Party Committee, to properly mediate. However, the workers were incited by malicious elements, gathered to occupy the Social Affairs Bureau, and refused to disperse, obstructing official duties. The actions were excessive and disregarded the law, which was truly unacceptable. According to reports, there were indeed people who were not workers manipulating and directing from within. The municipal government, considering that the workers were simple-minded, sought to resolve the matter in a roundabout way and was unwilling to punish them by law. Those who incited and instigated have been ordered to be investigated and arrested. Regarding the labor-capital dispute, the matter should be resolved after awaiting proper arrangements by the party and government organs. In recent years, the city has been affected by the current situation, and all industries are in decline. It is appropriate to strive for production and strengthen our forces. Both labor and capital should understand each other during this period and not create misunderstandings. Chairman Chiang's recent telegram also earnestly advised that labor and capital should be interdependent and must cooperate. Factory owners and workers should all abide by this.</p>
<p>Wage Reduction Issue to Be Handled Continuously</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau who spoke to a Dagong News Agency reporter, regarding the issue of wage reduction at the American-Asiatic Factory, the Social Affairs Bureau has decided to continue handling the matter in accordance with the law. Although the factory claimed that it had been shut down for a long time and its economic turnover was sluggish, requesting to be declared bankrupt, the Social Affairs Bureau still ordered it to resume operations as usual and maintain workers' meals in order to avoid inciting accidents and causing major disputes. As for the workers, if there are any further acts of resistance and trouble-making, they will be dealt with severely in order to maintain local order.</p>
<p>Party and Government Proclamation Orders Resumption of Work</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued a joint proclamation yesterday, ordering the workers to resume work, stating that the decline of China's silk industry has not been a matter of a single day. The American-Asiatic Silk Weaving Factory in the city, with its relatively large capital, has been able to maintain itself with great effort amid the industry's precarious situation. The workers working in the factory should remember the spirit of being in the same boat and share the difficulties together. However, during this wage reduction dispute, while the Social Affairs Bureau was convening a mediation committee, the factory workers still gathered to cause trouble in the name of petitioning. Such disregard for the facts and the expansion of the dispute clearly indicates that there are reactionary elements instigating them. If the labor-capital dispute leads the factory to a point of no return, wouldn't it be a situation of mutual harm? In addition to the wage reduction dispute still being mediated in accordance with the law, and ordering the factory to resume operations as usual, a special joint proclamation is issued, ordering all workers of the factory to comply, resume work on the specified date, work with peace of mind, and be careful not to be exploited by others to test the law. Be vigilant and do not violate this order. Sincerely, this proclamation, dated April, 23rd year of the Republic of China. Standing Committee Members Pan Gongzhan, Wu Xingya, Tong Xingbai. Director Wu Xingya.</p>
<p>Factory Claims Meal Supply Never Disrupted</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the factory, all factories have never disrupted meal supply. Factories 4, 10, and 7 are still providing meals as usual. However, the welfare workers who manage the meals in each factory have been repeatedly detained, beaten, and humiliated by the workers. Tea, water, and food have also been unable to enter. Their suffering is extreme. Ma Bole, the factory director of Factory 4, was even detained by the workers for a day and a night. He was rescued by police officers from the Sixth District's Security Bureau before he was able to escape. Therefore, the welfare workers are extremely fearful for the safety of their own lives and were only able to escape when the workers went to the city center to surround the Social Affairs Bureau. They are unwilling to continue to return to work. Currently, each factory has rice and firewood in reserve, and the cooks are still remaining in the factory. There should be no problem with the workers' meals. The factory is now trying its best to persuade the welfare workers to return to the factory to work.</p>
<p>Factories to Resume Operations Today in Compliance with Orders</p>
<p>The American-Asiatic Silk Weaving General Company, in order to comply with the orders of the party and government organs to resume operations immediately, has decided to make efforts to resume operations starting today. The general company has notified all branch factories to sound the whistle and resume operations as usual this morning, urging the workers to enter the factory and resume work. The party and government are deeply concerned that accidents may occur temporarily, so they have notified the Municipal Public Security Bureau to dispatch police to protect each factory. The factories in the concession areas have also been notified to the concession authorities for the same protection.</p>
<p>Federation of Trade Unions' Letter to American-Asiatic Workers</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions issued a letter to all workers of the American-Asiatic Factory yesterday, stating that, beloved workers of the American-Asiatic Factory, in today's China, under the continuous aggression of imperialism, the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and industrial and commercial enterprises are becoming increasingly depressed. The entire country is in a precarious situation. The imperialists are taking advantage of our danger to intensify their political aggression and implement dumping policies to carry out economic aggression. China's fledgling industry and commerce, after this major blow, and because of the social and economic depression, are increasingly trapped in a dangerous situation. News of factory closures and wage reductions is heard from all over the country, and the number of unemployed workers is rapidly increasing, forming a major domestic panic today. In this crisis, how should our labor and capital maintain each other, cooperate sincerely, break through this difficulty, and survive this difficult situation together? However, a few capitalists who are ignorant of the situation are still unable to awaken and continue to follow their habitual techniques of oppressing workers, creating unnecessary disputes. There are also some unscrupulous elements who disregard the current crisis and carry out their methods of sowing discord, inciting workers to indulge their ability to cause trouble, leading to major disputes between labor and capital. This is what the federation deeply regrets. The American-Asiatic Silk Factory, under the pretext that the silk industry is extremely depressed and business cannot be maintained, suddenly announced a wage reduction without submitting it to the party and government organs for approval, causing the workers' lives to be affected. The process is indeed inappropriate. Our workers announced a strike to seek self-preservation, and the federation expresses its deep sympathy. Maintaining the strike until now has lasted for a month. The federation is particularly concerned about the suffering of the workers' lives during the strike period. Now that the case has been mediated by the party and government organs in accordance with the law, the workers should share the difficulties together, be in the same boat, resume work on the specified date, and await a solution. This way, the future of the industry will not go bankrupt, and their own livelihoods will be spared from being affected. Do not be exploited by others to cause further incidents. This is what the federation sincerely hopes for.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Construction Committee Negotiates Electricity Loan with Banking Syndicate; Total Loan Amount is Three Million Yuan; Secured by Continued Issuance of Electricity Public Bonds <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that the Capital Construction Committee recently negotiated with the Shanghai banking community to borrow three million yuan for electricity projects, for the development of the Capital Electric Plant, the Qishuyan Electric Plant, and the Huainan Mining Bureau. After a month of negotiations, it has now been completely successful. The Shen Shi News Agency reporter has recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Use of Loan</p>
<p>The Capital Electric Plant, the Qishuyan Electric Plant, and the Huainan Mining Bureau are all projects directly managed by the Construction Committee. Although the scale is not very small, due to a lack of funds and sluggish turnover, development is difficult. The three million yuan borrowed from the Shanghai banking syndicate is expected to be allocated as follows: (1) Capital Electric Plant: 1.2 million yuan; (2) Qishuyan Electric Plant: 600,000 yuan; (3) Huainan Mining Bureau: 1.2 million yuan, for a total of 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Hope for Projects</p>
<p>According to a certain high-ranking official who represented the Construction Committee in the loan negotiations, the loan has now been fully established and the procedures have been agreed upon. In the future, this loan will be used to develop the following: (1) The Capital Electric Plant can increase its generating capacity by 10,000 kilowatts, and the necessary transmission, distribution, and user equipment can be improved according to plan. (2) The Qishuyan Electric Plant is the main hub for supplying power to the industries of Changzhou and Wuxi, and its position is particularly important. In the future, with improved equipment and increased capacity, the cost of electricity for each factory can be reduced, alleviating the burden on factories. This is a fundamental plan for developing industry and commerce. (3) The Huainan Mining Bureau was established in April 1930. The mining area is located in Shungeng Mountain, Huaiyuan, Anhui. Currently, it can only produce 7-8 tons of bituminous coal per day. After the loan is successful, new-style machinery will be purchased, and the daily output can be increased to 1,200 tons. Within two years, the estimated daily output can reach 3,000 tons. The coal quality is excellent, and the mineral resources are abundant, making it a promising mine.</p>
<p>Lending Banks</p>
<p>The amount of this loan is a total of three million yuan. The lending banks include twelve institutions: the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Bank, the China &amp; South Sea Bank, the Jin Cheng Bank, the Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, the Continental Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Ningpo Commercial Bank, the Kwang Hua Commercial Bank, the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. The Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Bank contributed the most, accounting for about half of the total. The two parties signed the contract yesterday, using the continued issuance of electricity public bonds as collateral, to be repaid in three years. The banking syndicate has designated the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications as representative banks to be responsible for receipts and payments. The funds are being paid in installments.</p>

Although the decision has been made, the date of departure has attracted much attention. According to reliable information from the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Industry, Chen and Guo have decided to take a ship from Shanghai on the 18th. Chen is currently in Beijing handling ministerial affairs and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by train on the night of the 12th (today) to handle private matters. During Minister Chen's inspection, the position of Minister will be temporarily held by Executive Vice Minister Liu Weichi.</p>
<h3 id="e142">He Bingxian Lectures on International Trade; Last Year's Trade Deficit Decreased Due to Weak Purchasing Power; Gu Jigao Says Trade Deficit is Not Absolutely Disadvantageous <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The International Problems Research Association and the International Trade Association invited He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, to lecture on "International Trade Issues" at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road at 5 PM yesterday. Members of the two associations, including Guo Bingwen, Li Zhaohuan, Chen Zheqing, Shen Xinqing, Cai Wuji, Gu Jigao, Xu Fengshi, Liu Shimu, Zhang Xianglin, Zhu Shaoping, and Tu Chuyu, attended. Mr. Weeks, editor of the American Asiatic Review, who happened to be traveling in Shanghai, was also invited to participate in the tea party, which was chaired by Li Zhaohuan. The following is a record of He's speech and the discussion. Reduced Trade Deficit.</p>
<p>Mr. He began by saying that the scope of international trade issues</p>
<p>is too broad to be covered in a short period of time. He will briefly describe the analysis of import and export trade last year and study the questions found in international trade statistics. The total import and export trade of the country last year was over 1.95 billion yuan, a decrease of 19% compared to the previous year (1932). The total amount of imports was over 1.3 billion taels, a decrease of 18% compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>The total amount of exports was over 610 million taels, a decrease of 20% compared to the previous year. However, this ratio of decrease cannot be used as a basis for research, because the import and export figures of the Northeast customs were included in the first half of the previous year. If the figures of the Northeast customs for the first half of the previous year are removed for comparison, then imports last year decreased slightly compared to the previous year, while exports increased by more than 40 million taels. Comparatively, the trade deficit decreased by more than 100 million taels. Weak Purchasing Power.</p>
<p>The reduced trade deficit is a good phenomenon at first glance, but if one considers the reality, the decrease in imports is actually due to the bankruptcy of China's rural areas and the weak purchasing power of the people. It is not optimistic because China has increased import taxes, while exports are still mostly raw materials. As for the classification of goods, the largest imports are agricultural products such as rice, wheat, and cotton, followed by new industrial products. Exports are mostly silk, tea, tung oil, etc., which have not changed slightly compared to decades ago.</p>
<p>Decrease with Japan. Observing by country, the United States ranks first in imports, the United Kingdom ranks second, Japan ranks third, and Germany ranks fourth. As for export countries, Hong Kong ranks first, the United States ranks second, and the United Kingdom and Japan rank next. This is different from the previous years, when Japan was the largest in both imports and exports. The reasons for this are certainly not limited to one, and the impact of the loss of the Northeast is perhaps the greatest.</p>
<p>Statistical Difficulties. When studying international trade, customs statistics are the most reliable basis. If it is extrapolated and compared with the statistics of other countries, there should logically be the same result. For example, if we have a trade deficit with them, then they must have a trade surplus with us. However, the results are unexpected. For example, China has had a trade deficit with Italy and Germany for many years, but the trade statistics of Italy and Germany show that they also have a trade deficit with China, which is a strange thing. The reasons for the discrepancy may be the following three points: First, the statistical methods are different. For example, due to re-export, China includes the country of the port of export, while other countries do not. Or, goods passing through Hong Kong are considered by them to be exported to Hong Kong, while we include them in the original exporting country. Second, the estimated prices of goods are different. Third, or there are still unreported tax imports.</p>
<p>This Year's Observations. After He finished his speech, Guo Bingwen and others successively expressed their opinions and briefly discussed how to balance international trade. Later, Gu Jigao asked He about the prospects for trade this year and whether there were any better hopes. He replied that it is not easy to collect sufficient materials to base on this time, so it is difficult to make a definite prediction. However, in his personal opinion, if silver prices continue to rise, the prospects for export trade are not optimistic.</p>
<p>Gu's Opinion. Next, silver expert Gu Jigao expressed his opinion on the trade deficit issue, saying that a trade deficit is not absolutely disadvantageous to us. For example, Japan and the United Kingdom are both trade deficit countries, but they are not weak because of it. In China, which has a backward industry, if domestic prices do not fall, then because of the higher interest rates, overseas Chinese and foreigners are happy to invest, so that the industry can be gradually built. The investors are not cash, but goods that are in trade deficit, so it does not have a very bad impact on us. Therefore, the trade deficit has increased in recent decades, but the outflow of cash is not much. After 1930, China increased tariffs, but the increase was not of a protective nature, but only to increase fiscal revenue. Afterwards, the world economic panic followed, creating a bad trade environment. In recent years, although the amount of imports in the customs trade books has increased, it is entirely due to the gold exchange rate relationship. In reality, we exchange a huge amount of agricultural products for a small number of goods from other countries. If you want to use artificial force to force a trade balance, it will inevitably lead to lower prices for agricultural products, forcing a huge amount of exports, which will further plunge the national economy into difficulty.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Italian Aviator Penatti Arrives in Shanghai and Talks About the Urgent Need to Save the Country Through Aviation <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Italian aviator Penatti, who performed in the city, was well received by people from all walks of life. He then went to Beijing, Nanjing, and other places for sightseeing and has now returned to Shanghai. The Shen Shi News Agency reporter visited him yesterday. According to him, he still has no definite date to return to his country. Before returning to his country, he will visit Chairman Chiang to discuss matters. The scenery of China is beautiful, and the people are harmonious, which makes me happy and forget to return. Especially the scenery of Beijing is picturesque and has a more natural and vivid beauty than in books. Mr. Penatti also said that when the Conte Rosso arrived in Shanghai a week ago, it brought a new-style fighter jet from Italy. This new aircraft is sturdy in construction, has a very high flying speed, and is equipped with machinery that can be assembled at will. It is suitable for both water and land. I have scheduled to fly this new aircraft and perform again to thank the kindness of all sectors. Finally, Mr. Penatti said that</p>
<p>China has a vast land and abundant resources, and saving the country through aviation is urgent.</p>

<p>The New Life Movement Promotion Association's publicity meeting, yesterday being Business Day, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce originally scheduled to meet at 2 PM. However, due to heavy rain, merchants and residents in the South City, Zhabei, and Jiangwan areas were unable to attend the meeting. In order to rectify the spirit and enhance the appearance, the association's chairman Wang Xiaolai, standing committee member Wang Yansong, Municipal Party Committee's Jiang Huaisu, and Municipal Government's Li Dachao, jointly decided to temporarily announce a postponement.</p>

<p>Guowen News Agency reports that seven shipping companies operating on the Sichuan River, including China Merchants, Minsheng, Taikoo, Jufu, Jiejiang, Sanbei, and Ewo, caused dissatisfaction among passengers and cargo merchants after the league increased water feet and freight rates. There was once a refusal to load, and the two sides argued for two months without a solution. Later, the Chongqing Municipal Chamber of Commerce served as a mediator, re-determined the new water feet, and announced its implementation. The seven shipping companies initially expressed their inability to accept, but considering that this would lead to a situation of mutual harm in the long run, and the shipping losses would inevitably be greater than those of the passengers and merchants, they negotiated several times and decided to slightly increase the water feet determined by the Chongqing meeting. That is, the original 5.5 jiao per English foot for wooden boxes was changed to 6 jiao, and 7.5 jiao was changed to 8 jiao. The passengers and merchants also expressed their agreement. Since the day before yesterday, each ship has been loading normally, and those who ordered goods are also very enthusiastic. The dispute has now been completely resolved. However, according to reports, Japanese merchants are actively restoring the Hankou-Yichang and Yichang-Chongqing shipping routes. Yesterday, after an investigation by reporters, it is difficult to materialize. Even if it can sail, the anti-Japanese atmosphere in the interior is still very tense, and no one dares to load rashly. The Japanese are cunning and are only using the old tricks of Pei Qian from years ago.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Yesterday the Municipal Government Issued a Notice Prohibiting the Mortgage of Jing'an Temple Property, Ordering the New Abbot Yuan Ying to Immediately Take Over <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The property dispute of Jing'an Temple in this city has lasted for ten years. After the Ministry of Interior, along with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance, decided on a solution, the Shanghai Buddhist Association elected Yuan Ying, Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, to serve as abbot. It is now learned that the previous abbot, Zhi Wen, had mortgaged the temple property at a low price. The Municipal Government issued a special notice yesterday to prohibit this. The notice is recorded below:</p>
<p>According to the case concerning the property dispute of Jing'an Temple in this city and the mutual contention for the position of abbot, this government previously received an order from the central government instructing the Shanghai Buddhist Association to convene representatives of various mountains to elect Dharma Master Yuan Ying as the new abbot of Jing'an Temple. At the same time, impartial individuals were separately appointed to organize a committee to begin the cleanup. All former monks of the temple, such as Zhi Wen, were not legitimate abbots and had no right to dispose of the temple's property. Repeated orders to stop such actions have been issued. Now that the new abbot is about to take over, it has been reported that there have been instances of mortgaging and renting out Jing'an Temple property at low prices. If this is true, it is extremely audacious and will certainly be strictly investigated and dealt with, without any leniency. All citizens should not be fooled and misinformed, lest they bring trouble upon themselves.

<h3 id="e147">The Trial of Mark in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Grand Fraud Case Concludes; Sentenced to Two Years of Imprisonment <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Among the defendants in the case of the giant fraud against the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in this port, there is a British man named Mark. After the preliminary trial was established, he was transferred to the British Assize Court for interrogation. Witnesses have been summoned for questioning in recent days. The trial concluded the night before last. After the judge, Mo Su, stated the defendant's charges to the five jurors, the five retired to consider whether the defendant was guilty of conspiring to defraud. About ten minutes later, they decided that the defendant was indeed guilty and informed the judge. Then the judge asked if the defendant had any previous bad records. The Royal Counsel replied that, to his knowledge, the defendant was a first-time offender. Then the defendant's lawyer, Hatuopu, rose and said that although the defendant was indeed guilty, the case involved many people. He dared to ask the court not to regard the defendant as the principal offender, but only as one of the accomplices, and to be lenient. The judge then declared to the defendant that the trial of the case had lasted for six and a half days. The jurors all believed that all three counts of the crime of conspiring to defraud with false checks were true. He knew that the defendant was not the mastermind, but only trapped among the criminals, hoping to recover his money. According to British law, the crime is very serious and must be severely punished. But after considering the words of the lawyer for the defendant, he felt that the sentence should be executed at the same time. The defendant's sentence for each count is two years of imprisonment. The judge finished the declaration, thanked the jurors, and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Tonghua Steamer Imported and Crashed Into a River Pontoon Lightship <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tonghua steamer returned to Shanghai from Shantou yesterday. When it reached the Jinliyuan Wharf in the Huangpu River, it crashed into a customs river pontoon lightship. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>There Was Fog En Route</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tonghua steamer last sailed from Shanghai fully loaded with cargo to Shantou. When it returned from Shantou to Shanghai, because most of the local cargo was loaded by the Taikoo and Jardine Matheson steamers, the Tonghua only carried 75 pieces. Returning to Shanghai was almost like traveling empty. The ship encountered heavy fog on the Zhejiang sea. The captain, Jiang Changqing, navigated very cautiously. Because he was traveling empty, he dared not take risks, so he anchored and waited for the fog to clear at Baijiemen. After a day and a night, when the fog cleared, he set sail, which delayed the voyage by one day. He only arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Entering the Port and Anchoring</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Tonghua steamer entered the port. The Bureau was crowded with old and jointly transported goods waiting to be transported, so it ordered it to berth at the Jinliyuan Wharf in the South City in order to load cargo. The Tonghua steamed into the Huangpu River and went straight to the South Wharf. Lightly loaded and with fast currents, the captain ordered it to move slowly forward. When the Tonghua reached the river surface near the Xinjiangtian Wharf, it turned around as usual. At that time, the engine had stopped. After turning the hull straight, it docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf.</p>
<p>The Lightship Did Not Leave</p>
<p>In each section of the Huangpu River, the Jianghai Customs routinely dispatched a lightship at night to be stationed on the river pontoon, displaying lights to warn. At dawn, the lightship must be withdrawn. When the Tonghua arrived in front of River Pontoon No. 5 (that is, the Xinjiangtian Wharf river pontoon), it was already dawn, but the Shanghai Customs lightship on the river pontoon had not yet left. At that time, the Tonghua ship arrived and wanted to turn around urgently. The tide was also rapid. The lightship was obstructing the turn. The crew of the Tonghua shouted loudly to open quickly to avoid causing trouble.</p>
<p>The Hull Was Wrecked</p>
<p>At that time, there were three people on the lightship. They noticed that the Tonghua had arrived and were informed to cut the ropes and leave quickly. The people on the lightship did not pay attention. The Tonghua's engine did not start and took advantage of the tide to turn around. The lightship did not avoid it in time and was hit. The stern of the ship was sinking into the river. Fortunately, the three people in the lightship grabbed the river pontoon and were saved from falling into the water. However, the lightship had been wrecked. Fortunately, the Tonghua quickly retreated, otherwise River Pontoon No. 5 would also have been affected and destroyed.</p>
<p>The Ferry Towed It Away</p>
<p>After the customs lightship was wrecked, the ferry from Dongmen Road arrived and tried to tow the wrecked lightship to the South City. It also reported to the customs. After the Tonghua stopped, the captain, Jiang Changqing, also went to the head office and reported the details of the customs lightship obstructing navigation and being wrecked to the shipping department.</p>

<p>Ruffians Xue Lin and Jin Xingnong, etc., because they were extremely poor and bored, then indulged in fantasy. They telegraphed senior military authorities, reporting that there was a reactionary group in Shanghai plotting to overthrow the government. They could act as clues, and it would not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop, but they needed application fees and considerable rewards, so they first requested start-up costs. As a result, they defrauded hundreds of dollars, which were received from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. However, after defrauding the money, there was no news. The money had already been spent. Then they concocted a second instance of deceit.</p>
<h3 id="e150">English Businessman's Public Bus Crushes a Chinese Person in Passing <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau's Director Tan Talks</p>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" of this port published on the 10th that at 6 PM on the 7th, a public bus of the English China General Omnibus Company crushed a Chinese person on Connaught Road in the extraterritorial settlement. Because of injuries, they were treated at a public hospital, resulting in death. Yesterday, according to Tan Baoshou, director of the 6th district, the district under whose jurisdiction the incident occurred, at 6:07 PM on the 7th, a Route 10 public bus of the English China General Omnibus Company was driving east on Connaught Road. When it reached the address 372 Connaught Road, the deceased, Shen Hongzhang, was also riding a bicycle, riding east against the right side of the public bus. At the same time, a Route 10 public bus with special district license number 15007 of the same company was driving west on Connaught Road. Shen Hongzhang swerved left to avoid the oncoming public bus, resulting in a collision with the public bus driving east. He was knocked down by the right rear wheel of the bus and then run over the neck and chest by the right front wheel of the public bus with special district license number 15007 driving west to east. Li Degui, the police officer of the 11th post in the district, heard the news and rushed to the scene of the accident. The driver of public bus number 407, Wang Changgui, had already fled. Shen Hongzhang died immediately due to his serious injuries. The deceased's mother, Shen Weng, who runs a cigarette paper shop at 360 Connaught Road, also rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and felt her son's hands and head, which were already cold. His mouth was open and bleeding, and his nose was also bleeding. He had already died. There was also an eyewitness, Ma Wende, who stepped forward after the accident and saw that Shen Hongzhang was lying on his back, his limbs motionless, and he had already died. The above three people all arrived before the ambulance. The district, because a person had died, and the Gordon Road police station wanted to move the body, the district should take pictures for filing. The newspaper claimed that "The Tragic Image of an English Businessman's Public Bus Crushing a Chinese Person"</p>
<p>China's police did not allow the injured to be sent to the hospital immediately, resulting in death, etc., completely contradicts the facts. Such inversion is likely to contain the effect of pushing and shirking responsibility, etc.</p>
<p>fraud, which was discovered as a fake. A secret order was issued to the Garrison Headquarters to lure the two criminals, who were handed over to the military court for investigation. The whole case has become clear.</p>
<p>However, since fraud to obtain property is an ordinary criminal offense, they were transferred to the local court yesterday for legal action.</p>

<p>The home of the famous doctor Zhang Gunong, located at No. 3 Yongxingli, Anhai Road, inside the Old North Gate, was suddenly visited by five thieves at 1:00 PM yesterday. Two thieves holding pistols, wearing long robes, broke in first, claiming to be there for medical treatment. Three thieves then stood guard. Unexpectedly, the two thieves who entered first immediately took out guns to frighten and prohibit any noise, monitoring the servant and keeping them from moving. Then they went upstairs to search and rummage through boxes and chests, robbing a total of more than four hundred dollars in cash, as well as a pearl necklace, three gold lockets, and several other gold, pearl, and diamond jewelry pieces, worth more than a thousand yuan, and fled. After the thieves left, Mr. Zhang opened a list and reported to the Second Branch of the Second District, requesting an arrest. Chief Shen immediately dispatched police chief Ma Yumin to lead the police to rush to the area to round up the thieves. However, since it had been a long time, the thieves had already fled far away. They went to Mr. Zhang's house to investigate for a week and returned to the office to report to Chief Shen. He then requested the headquarters to order an integrated arrest based on intelligence.</p>

<p>In various parts of the Chinese concession in this port, it has recently been discovered that there is a Ma Hua (i.e., Ma Shaohou) who claims to be a colonel of the army infantry, an assistant of the fourth group of the seventh branch of the recruiting headquarters of the Nanchang Military Committee, and the director of the Shanghai office of the preparatory committee of the Volunteer Relief Committee of the Chinese Relief Front Line Wounded Sanatorium. He wears a blue-gray cloth military uniform, carries an armed belt, wears leather shoes, carries a document bag, and carries a cane, flaunting himself in the city. His office locations have been rented in Room 22 of the Baoyuli Hotel in the French Concession's Xinqiao area, and at No. 44 Mantingfang, Wuma Road, in the Public Concession. His behavior is very extravagant. Whenever he has business to discuss, he does so in teahouses and restaurants, specializing in fraud. A certain person, who has a strong desire for officialdom, asked Ma to find him a position as accounting director. After several contacts, the result was that the person had to pay 360 yuan in foreign currency as an activity fee. It was agreed that the money would be handed over at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 11th) at the Guanshengyuan Restaurant on Heping Road in Ximen. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by a female investigator of the Inspectorate of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. She reported the information to the director of the Special Affairs Section, who ordered the female investigator to cooperate with the police officers of the second district of the museum. At about 3:00 PM yesterday, they secretly went to Guanshengyuan on Heping Road. It happened that Ma Hua was having a meeting, and Ma was arrested. The bag was taken to the district for interrogation. According to his confession, he is from Xuzhou, 32 years old, and speaks evasively. A large number of fake documents were found in the bag, including 64 silk ribbon symbols, 5 Chinese Relief Front Line Wounded Sanatorium staff certificates made of red and gold paper, a small mirror frame license signed by Zhang Xueliang of the Northern Pacification Office, a small mirror frame notice signed by the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Military Affairs, Wang Zhaoming, and He Yingqin, an appointment signed by Zhong Zhaojun, the director of the Chinese Relief Front Line Wounded Sanatorium, and many of Ma Hua's official title business cards and letters, as well as armed belts, etc., were all filed. After interrogation by Director Li, Ma was charged with impersonating a military officer and was transferred to the third section of the headquarters for legal action.</p>
<p>Zhao Weixian's Complaint Against Wei Tingrong Case is Postponed</p>
<p>Wei Cannot Attend Due to Eye Disease</p>
<p>As a Result, the Hearing is Postponed for Three Weeks</p>
<p>Wei Tingrong, the former commander of the Chinese Volunteer Corps in the French Concession, was kidnapped by bandits for ransom. The case involved his relative, Zhao Weixian, the former commander of the Sixth Independent Battalion of the Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and the current colonel of the practice team of the Central Air Defense School. He was arrested by the French Police and transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. After being found innocent and released, Zhao hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Qin Liankui, etc., to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Local Court, accusing Wei Tingrong and Wei Yuansheng, father and son, of false accusations. The court accepted the lawsuit and initially opened a court session to summon them. Because the lawyer of the Police Department of the French Bureau of Works attended the session according to the agreement, the court was instructed to wait for a report to be submitted to the superiors for explanation. The hearing was postponed. Later, because a certain major businessman in Shanghai mediated, both parties applied for a postponement, which was recorded in the previous newspaper. Because the mediation failed, the court summoned both parties and scheduled a joint hearing at 2:00 PM yesterday. The defendant, Wei Tingrong, could not attend the hearing due to eye disease, keratitis and iritis. At noon yesterday, he submitted a statement to the court, stating the reasons for his illness and the current mediation by a certain Ma, and attached a certificate from a Red Cross doctor, requesting that the hearing be postponed for one month. At 2:00 PM, the plaintiff Zhao Weixian arrived at the court in military uniform with his wife and brother, accompanied by a lawyer, to report and wait for instructions. On the defendant's side, because of the application for postponement, no one reported. At 2:30 PM, Judge Li Changnian, accompanied by clerk Wang Baoxun, took a seat in the Second Criminal Court for the hearing. First, the plaintiff Zhao Weixian was asked about his age, hometown, and occupation. Then, the announcement was made that the defendant had submitted a statement stating that he could not attend the court due to illness, and that a certain Ma was mediating a settlement and requested a postponement. The statement was then handed over to the plaintiff's lawyer for review. Then, Qin Liankui, the plaintiff's lawyer, stood up, expressed his legal opinion on the defendant's request for postponement due to illness, and said that the plaintiff was now working at the Air Defense School and his duties were important, so he could not leave his post often, and requested the court to consider shortening the period. The official then ruled that the hearing be postponed for three weeks and scheduled for 2:00 PM on May 2nd. The court was adjourned.</p>

At 12:00 PM yesterday, taking advantage of the unpreparedness of the Party and government authorities, the parade was held suddenly. Starting from Fuyou Road, passing Houjiabang, Jiomudi, to Zhaojiabang Road, and returning to the temple via Sanpailou, all the ceremonial guards were still in accordance with the previous practice. Various cavalry teams, flag teams, Yincao officials, judges, iron chains, executioners, etc., were all complete. In addition to the City God, the parade included the statues of Gaochang Si, Changren Si, Caibosi, etc. Although it rained yesterday, the crowd along the way was still extremely crowded.

<p>The Futaihe Silk and Satin Shop, located at No. 38 Dasheng Lane inside Xiaodongmen, is opened by Wang Jiabin (54 years old) from Danyang. Its business is usually quite prosperous. The shop has a total of three buildings. In addition to the first and second buildings being used as shops, the upper floor of the last building is rented to Lisheng Sugar Warehouse. The owner of the warehouse, Chen Lisheng, is currently 51 years old and from Shaoxing. All his family members also live in the warehouse. At 11:30 AM yesterday, four thieves suddenly broke into the Futaihe Silk and Satin Shop under the pretext of asking questions. One thief was left to guard the gate, and the remaining three thieves entered the shop, each taking out a gun, and drove all the employees of the shop into the厢房of the Lisheng Sugar Warehouse in the third building. A robber wearing a black gabardine long gown stayed there and guarded the employees' actions with a gun. Two thieves then broke into the accounting room of the shop and the bedroom of Chen Lisheng, the owner of the Lisheng Sugar Warehouse, and rummaged through boxes and chests, looting a total of more than 2,000 yuan in banknotes from the shop's accounting table (of which 1,000 yuan were new banknotes from the Bank of Communications, and each banknote was stamped with the hidden mark "民". There were also 700 yuan of semi-new and old banknotes from the Central Bank, each of which was also stamped with the code "42". The rest were various banknotes.), 90 cents in small foreign currency, and jade bracelets, pearl bracelets, pearl hairpins, pearl ear picks, etc., each, stored in Chen Lisheng's family's boxes, and carried the stolen goods out the door. Together with the thief standing guard at the gate, they scattered and fled. However, the thief who was monitoring the employees had not yet realized that his accomplices had already obtained the stolen goods and fled, so he was still standing in the last building, yelling at the employees to keep quiet. As a result, one of the employees took the opportunity to sneak out of the shop and reported to police officer Duan Jingming of the nearby 13th post for assistance in the arrest. After hearing the report, the police officer immediately rushed into the shop. At that time, the thief caught sight of the police officer arriving and realized that the situation had been lost. He ran out and fired a shot at the police officer to resist arrest. However, the thief was actually an amateur and did not know the method of firing a gun. Therefore, although he used his finger to move the firing pin, the bullet was not loaded into the barrel, so the bullet could not be fired. Seeing the opportunity, the police officer jumped forward and hugged the thief, snatching the pistol and finally capturing him alive. At that time, the second district of the first district also received a police report. The director, Liu Yunfang, led a large number of long-term police officers to rush to the scene of the incident and rounded up the area. However, because it was too late, the three thieves were nowhere to be seen, so they gained nothing. They took the captured thief back to the station. After a strict interrogation, he confessed that his name was Huang Defa, 33 years old, from Dongyang. He was previously a tailor and is now unemployed. The rest of his words were vague. It was later learned that the pistol held by the thief was a six-inch Brownring pistol with six bullets inside, but the gun handle was engraved with the number 125939 of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. The subordinates were ordered to temporarily detain the thief, and he personally led the long-term police officers to pursue and arrest the remaining thieves, and secretly investigate the origin of the gun. It is reported that many thieves have been arrested and are currently being interrogated.</p>
<p>Landing, the wheel company gave Dr. Te special treatment, and the fares, etc., were given special discounts.</p>
<p>Captains Can Be Exempted From Examination by the Ministry for Certificate Renewal: Within this year's January, a new chapter was specially issued stating that when applying for renewal after the expiration of the captain's certificate, an examination by the Examination Committee of the Ministry of Communications should also be taken in accordance with the Regulations on Crew Qualification, and if qualified, a certificate will be issued, etc. The Shanghai Masters Association raised an objection to this matter, and submitted a request to the Ministry to abolish the captain's certificate examination item. The Ministry has replied to Shanghai, approving the preservation of this case in the Ministry, so captains can be exempted from examination when renewing their certificates.</p>

The presidium of the fundraising group, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, and others, determined that since the group only started work on the 20th of last month, the timing should not be compared with the friendship building group’s 40 teams. Therefore, the final results for the fundraising group will be announced on the evening of the 20th of this month. It is said that the leaders are extremely dedicated to this fundraising drive. Most of the funds have already been submitted. It is expected that within these ten days, the group will definitely reach its target of 20,000 points. It is predicted that the results of this fundraising drive may, as Mayor Wu said, break the association's historical fundraising record.</p>

<p>92 Qi and 75 Ling: New Contributions in 1934</p>
<p>Shen Liuchun, a Ningbo merchant, has a long history and rich experience in the silk and satin printing business. He initially founded the Tiansun Printing Factory, which achieved excellent results and was well-known in society. Later, he founded the Xinfeng Silk Shop and Tianfeng Weaving Factory, which were then merged with the Tiansun Printing Factory, greatly expanding the business. Not long ago, its business premises moved to a new building in Qianji Lane on Tianjin Road for external operations, collectively known as Xinfeng Woven and Printed Silk Factory. Under the system of self-weaving, self-printing, and self-sufficiency, it strives to expand. It imitates the organization process of European and American trusts, managing three parts of the business, so that all 500 employees are dedicated to production and the improvement of products. It is said that the recently produced 92 Qi and 75 Ling have unparalleled texture and color, making them extremely suitable for spring clothing for modern women. Since their launch, demand has exceeded supply. Other new products are still under constant research. Moreover, the heads of the factory's departments encourage each other with the Han Dynasty's "Three Oaths of Righteousness."

<p>A Major Dispute Arises in the Ballroom</p>
<p>Yang Xianmei, a woman from Liyang living at No. 10 Hepingli, Avenue Edward VII, in the Public Concession, is a graceful and beautiful 25-year-old dancing girl. She currently works as a dancer at the Avenue Foch Dance Hall in the French Concession. At 3:30 AM on the 9th of this month, while Yang was sitting for a short break after dancing in the ballroom, Pan Meiying, a fellow dancer, sat next to Yang and was eating a large dish. Due to carelessness, she splashed the shrimp sauce from the dish, soiling Yang's newly made dance dress, which she had just put on. The oil stains were extremely unsightly. Yang immediately questioned Pan, asking why she wasn't more careful. Pan stubbornly refused to admit fault, and a quarrel ensued. Pan's companion, Chen Aying, was nearby, cheering her on. Words flew back and forth, and neither side would give in. The three initially argued verbally, but then escalated to physical violence. Yang, with her two fists, was ultimately no match for Pan and Chen's four hands. Pan slapped Yang's face repeatedly, while Chen punched Yang's arms and kicked her buttocks, causing Yang to suffer injuries. She complained to the dance hall's accounting office, but to no avail. Angrily, she went home and, yesterday afternoon, filed a lawsuit with the Second Special District Court's prosecutor's office, requesting a medical examination. She also hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to prepare a lawsuit, seeking a legal solution.</p>

<p>The Lei Yunshang Pharmacy at No. 252 Xinbeimenwai, Route de Sieyes, in the French Concession specializes in selling various pills, powders, plasters, and elixirs, especially its Liushen Pills, which are famous at home and abroad and sell in Japan for about a million dollars a year. This has led to unscrupulous people coveting the profits, often making counterfeit medicines to imitate and profit from. The store has offered a large reward for investigation and arrest, and there have been arrests and legal actions from time to time. However, unscrupulous elements still dare to defy the law and privately produce counterfeit medicines. Recently, Zhang Yaonan (41 years old), Li Jinyuan (25 years old), Song Tingshu (31 years old), and others from Nanjing were counterfeiting Liushen Pills, Wolong Pills, and other medicines, selling them under false pretenses in the market. The owner of Lei Yunshang Pharmacy, Lei Xianzhi, discovered this and reported it to the French police, requesting an investigation. The detective Lu Changsheng from the French police's detective department discovered that Zhang and others' counterfeiting operation was located at No. 30 Yuyangli, Rue du Maréchal Joffre. On the afternoon of the 10th, he secretly went to the address and arrested Zhang, Li, and Song. He confiscated three packages of pills, 2,500 ox horn boxes, 2,000 paper boxes, 21 bundles of imitations of labels of various sizes, a package of invoices, a half-foreign-style iron box of Wolong Pills, and many tools for manufacturing medicines. All were taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, explained the case, stating that the police had not yet investigated the case and requested a postponement pending a detailed investigation of the case, requesting a trial. He also presented the confiscated evidence. The detective also reported the arrest of the defendants and the details of the search. Judge Wu Fanglian reviewed the report and questioned the defendants briefly. He then approved a postponement of 14 days for further investigation and questioning. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Zhang A'er, a Ningbo native, 30 years old, lived at No. 49 Xiaobenli, Gongping Road. He was a ticket seller for streetcar No. 272 in the Public Concession. Yesterday, his friend Chen Yuqing, a coppersmith, held his wedding at the Zhuangyuanlou on Xinjibang Road in Hongkou. Zhang, because they had a long-standing friendship, took leave to help.

He lost his footing midway, injuring his head. Zhang also suffered from heart palpitations. He died on the spot. Later, the on-duty constable arrived and transported him to Tongren Hospital by car, transferring him to the coroner's office for examination.</p>

<p>Recently, due to the irregular weather, epidemics have been extremely rampant.

<p>China's flour milling industry has the most factories in Wuxi, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, Bengbu, Nanjing, and other places, with a total of more than 20 factories, capable of producing 300,000 bags of flour per day. Previously, they were sold to the Yingkou and Andong markets, but since the September 18th Incident, they have been seized by Japanese goods. When domestic goods arrive there, they must pay import taxes, making it difficult to compete. Although the government authorities have indicated that if domestically produced flour is sold in the eastern provinces, the taxes paid can be appropriately refunded, it has not yet been implemented. Flour prices have been steadily declining recently, with each bag losing 35 cents. All flour mills across the country can produce 300,000 bags of flour per day, which, at market prices, leads to a daily loss of more than 100,000 dollars. Therefore, in a few months, all flour mills across the country will go bankrupt, workers will lose their jobs, and the safety and security of society will be at stake, which is a cause for concern. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that the national flour milling industry is related to the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of workers and will face extinction, so it has specially dispatched commissioners to investigate the history of flour mills in various places in order to provide relief.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Umbrella Industry Dispute Resolved; Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning; Result of the Jingjiang Fellow-Countrymen Association's Mediation; Labor and Management Sign Four Conditions <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The strike of umbrella industry workers in this city was resolved yesterday through the mediation of the Jingjiang Fellow-Countrymen Association, with both sides agreeing to conditions and officially resuming work. Each factory will host the press at 6 PM tomorrow. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mediation Resolved</p>
<p>Since the umbrella workers' demands for management to sign a treaty were not met, the strike has been repeatedly mediated by party and government organs without success. The Jingjiang Fellow-Countrymen Association specially dispatched Zhang Yan, Chen Zhisun, Qu Shiji, and others, as well as the umbrella inventor Chen Lianfang, as fellow-countrymen and friends (because most of the labor and management in this industry are from Jingjiang, and most of the workers are Chen Lianfang's past employees) to mediate with both sides. Chen Lianfang even knelt down to the workers, forcing them to agree. It was not resolved until 6 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>Conditions Signed</p>
<p>Labor and management signed four conditions: (1) Workers whose monthly wages were originally above $10 will receive a 40% increase; those below $10 will receive a 50% increase. (2) Female workers will receive at least 1.2 cents for each umbrella they sew, excluding the frame (those who already have better terms will remain unchanged). (3) Workers who were originally paid by the piece will continue to be paid by the piece; those who are paid monthly will be handled according to the first condition. (4) Wages for the strike period will be paid at half rate.</p>
<p>Full Resumption of Work</p>
<p>After labor and management signed the conditions, all 1,000+ umbrella workers from 53 companies, including Fengli, Yingfeng, Minhua 1st, 2nd, 3rd, Minhua, Songlixin, etc., were notified separately by the mediators and labor-management representatives. They all resumed work at 7 AM yesterday. Unemployed workers no longer gathered to cause trouble. Both labor and management will submit the details of the agreement and the signed conditions to the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau for record.</p>
<p>Press Conference</p>
<p>The umbrella industry association, including Fengli and Minhua, believes that the news media's attitude towards this labor-management dispute was fair, so they have specifically scheduled to host reporters from various newspapers and news agencies at the Zhimeilou Restaurant on Daxin Street, Fuzhou Road, at 6 PM tomorrow to announce the details of the dispute and express their gratitude. Invitation cards will be distributed today.</p>

<p>Fan Shaozeng, the division commander of the Fourth Division of the 21st Army of the National Revolutionary Army, has won many battles and achieved considerable merits since receiving strict orders from the Central Government and the command of Army Commander Liu Xiang to suppress bandits. Division Commander Fan has made careful and meticulous plans for the bandit suppression work, working day and night. He always leads by example, bravely taking the lead in every battle. Therefore, his elite brigades and regiments are feared by the bandit army. Army Commander Liu Xiang, in command of a large army, is very glad to have such a person. Mr. Fan's loyalty to the party and the country is highly valued by the Central Government. Now, we have received a telegram from Division Commander Fan's Chongqing office to Shanghai, reporting victory. Zhou Brigade's Chen and Gao regiments occupied Jianglingtai, and Liu Regiment and Xu's unit also occupied Shichengzhai and Wangjingshan at the same time. The bandits in Jianglingtai collapsed and retreated from Jiazishan towards Shierzibailiang. The bandits in Shichengzhai and Wangjingshan collapsed and retreated to Xialao Guanmiao. In addition to ordering Liu Regiment and Xu Zaiming's unit to pursue the bandits, Zhou Brigade personally led Chen and Gao regiments to pursue Jiazishan. At 12:00, Meng Brigade also broke through Guanzishan, and the bandits pursued from Yangshan into Shiyalie and Shuangfenglie. The bandits on both routes were pinched and engaged in fierce battles by Zhou and Meng brigades for about two hours. The bandit rebellion fled toward the main front of Sitan River. Due to the rain, the large mountains, and the heavy fog, the bandits were scattered after the breakthrough. In addition to ordering Zhou Brigade's Gao Regiment to track them, the majority bivouacked in the Shuangfengshan area. After Liao Brigade broke through Hejiashan and Gancaoya, they followed in pursuit, and have now passed Luminglie, occupied Qiujialie, and are pursuing the bandits. Fan Brigade attacked Jinhuasi, but because the bandit fortifications were too strong, they only broke through at 8:00 AM and followed in pursuit, having occupied Nilongmiao and other places. It is now reported that Division Commander Fan is determined to suppress them with a large army, and it will not be difficult to clear the bandit area.</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read the "Local News" column in your newspaper, which contained a list of Chinese visitors attending the Nagasaki International Industrial Exposition, and my name was on the list.</p>
<p>After reading it, I was horrified. The reason is that I did not know the details of the expo before and thought it was a purely international industrial exposition of a sightseeing nature, so I once joined. After reading the newspaper, I learned that the expo had a different purpose, so I withdrew immediately to avoid being used. Now I am still in Shanghai and have not participated in going to Japan. I have nothing to do with all the subsequent actions of the group. I am afraid that there may be a misunderstanding, so I am writing to clarify this matter. Please correct it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hong Yisheng, April 10th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the parties involved, Xu Li-shi and Xu Cao-shi, who claim that the news item published in the Shen Bao on November 11th regarding the abandonment of a sick person in a vegetable garden who subsequently died is completely inconsistent with the facts. It has been verified that Liu Wen-kui's wife, Cai-shi, was ill, and Liu Wen-kui, together with his parents, carried Cai-shi to an open space on the east side of the residence when Cai-shi was dying. Although the parties are the landlords, they were never involved in the matter. Later, some unscrupulous people incited Liu Wen-kui to threaten the parties to borrow money without success, so they fabricated rumors in an attempt to slander them. If Liu Wen-kui has fabricated false accusations, the parties will file a lawsuit for false accusation. The report in the newspaper is based on hearsay and is inaccurate. Please ask your lawyer to send a letter to the newspaper requesting a correction, etc. We hereby inform you of the situation and hope that your newspaper will investigate and make a correction.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Another Example of Studying International Issues ㈡ <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Analyzing international politics not only requires considering the basic conflicts between nations at a certain stage, not only requires considering the ebb and flow of contradictions in a certain country, but most importantly, it is also impossible to forget all the changes within countries with different systems other than capitalism. For example, if we want to understand the increasingly urgent significance of the imperialist anti-Soviet war, we should not only understand it from the abstract proposition that capitalism and socialism are irreconcilable, but we must specifically understand it from the great victory of Soviet economic construction, the democracy of the masses expressed in the new political system, and the rapid increase in the material living standards of the masses. We should also examine the impact of the leap forward in new culture on the capitalist system. Only then can we understand that the imperialists are anti-Soviet not because they are anti-abstract socialism, but because they are anti-socialist countries that have been practicing and have won victory. The existence and growth of this monster is an invisible threat to capitalism. This is not only a major point that cannot be ignored in analyzing today's international situation, but even when analyzing the politics of a country on a small scale, one cannot let go of the influence exerted by this aspect. For example, the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union is extremely tense, but Japan still does not dare to try it lightly. If we want to understand this relationship, on the one hand, we can say that the tension in the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union is due to the success of Soviet economic construction, but at the same time, we must also know that the reason why Japan does not dare to try it lightly is precisely due to the success of Soviet economic construction. It seems contradictory, but it is actually very natural.</p>
<p>Are international issues that simple? No! Absolutely not! The above is just a brief examination from various aspects. If an observer only pays attention to one aspect and ignores other aspects, he will naturally only become a formalist, only seeing the trees and not seeing the forest. If an observer only grasps the main framework of international relations at a certain stage and ignores the specific facts of development, he will certainly see all the problems as empty and unable to grasp their particularity. The conclusions he makes will only be some abstract principles, becoming formalism. By reciting formulas, it will lose its temporality. As long as the general situation has not changed, it can be applied at almost any time. Although this type of observer is more advanced than the former, in reality, he is still of no use at all. At most, he is just a mechanist, mechanizing all dynamic situations. A scientific observer should not only accurately grasp the various aspects mentioned above, but also synthesize the situation of each historical stage from the various aspects or processes, in a lively and dynamic manner, point out the particularity of each historical stage, and point out the nature of every event that occurs in each historical stage. Because the occurrence of every problem in the international community today is not due to a simple factor, but is woven into a network with countless intersecting warp and weft threads. A scientific observer should not just say some empty words of principle and consider it done. He should specifically analyze the occurrence of facts, reveal their truth, and point out the direction of development.</p>
<p>Now it's time to go back to the question raised by Mr. Zhao. Mr. Zhao said, "The international situation is changing rapidly," which is absolutely true. Then Mr. Zhao said, "It is really elusive," which is not very correct. Although international issues are very complex and change quickly, in fact, as long as you observe carefully, they are still "graspable." Mr. Zhao's understanding of the "Japanese-American compromise" is also completely wearing formal theoretical glasses, so he cannot point out the shortcomings of many commentators' opinions, but only sees them as contradictions, which is meaningfully "deceiving" him.</p>
<p>We cannot deny the truth of "Japan and the United States cannot share interests in the Far East" and "A war must break out in the Pacific." At the same time, we also agree that "the economic relationship between Britain and the United States is even more serious than that between Japan and the United States." However, these words are only the main principles in studying the relationship between Japan and the United States and between Britain and the United States. The understanding of the current event of the Japanese-American compromise should not be understood without leaving these main principles, but we should not just recite these words of principle and consider it an answer to this question. This is largely why Mr. Zhao is dissatisfied with current events. Now let's give Mr. Zhao a hint of a research path on the "Japanese-American compromise."</p>
<p>Since the Japanese-American compromise is not as simple as Mr. Zhao said in his letter, then how should the foundation of its actual occurrence be understood? First, we must examine it from three aspects: Britain and the United States, Britain and Japan, and Japan and the United States. The relationship between Britain and the United States contains: "the contradiction of comprehensive economic opposition"; however, recent international events have not intensified their transition to a new battleground. The relationship between Britain and Japan has recently revealed a naked diplomatic war from trade competition, and they have reached a stage where they do not give way to each other. Although the relationship between Japan and the United States is indeed irreconcilable in the Pacific, the surface of the two countries' economic structure does not have much conflict. In terms of trade between the two countries, they are still very good, and they have been old customers for many years. Their discord is produced in the contradictions of capitalism itself and the future development of the two countries, so if there are changes in other aspects, a temporary compromise between Japan and the United States is possible. The recent international relations are naturally set against the backdrop of the world economic panic. The panic has made Britain and the United States feel hostile to each other everywhere; the panic has made Britain and Japan abandon the old alliance and turn to glaring at each other and refusing to give way; the panic has intensified the opposition between Japan and the United States in the Pacific; but at the same time, it has also prompted Japan to abandon Britain and turn to the United States to concede conditions. The United States has also failed to revive its country, the world situation is becoming increasingly difficult, and preparations for war have not yet been fully grasped. In the process of war organization,</p>
<p>American businessmen cannot help but think in their hearts, "We have no unpleasantness with Japan in business! Since they are negotiating with us, why don't we perfunctorily deal with them once? Haha, this is also breaking up the old friendship between Britain and Japan, which is a kind of threat to Britain!" (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e198">Drifting Record of Imperial Incense <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Although the imperial decree for the Holy Carriage to travel east had been decided, there were many things that needed to be prepared before departure. The first step was to have the Empress Dowager issue a formal edict, specifying on what date her special train would depart from Beijing and return to Fengtian. At the same time, a new law had to be added, which was that when the Empress Dowager's special train was running on the road, no other vehicles were allowed to move on any section of the road, and violators would be punished with extreme penalty. Of course, this time, the officials on the Beijing-Fengtian Railway could not avoid being assigned as basic service personnel. In addition, the Empress Dowager had to randomly pick out several important court officials to travel with her. As for all other preparatory work, it was handled by me and General Qing Shan, and I don't have time to write about it in detail here.</p>
<p>As soon as the preparatory work began, the railway workers were busy first. Because according to our estimate, to load all the officials, eunuchs, palace maids, and various utensils, materials, etc., this special imperial train had to be equipped with sixteen carriages. At the same time, because these vehicles had never been driven after being purchased, for the sake of prudence, it was necessary to conduct a thorough inspection first; this part of the work was actually completed very quickly. The next thing was to completely repaint the sixteen cars in yellow, which represented the royal family. The only thing that could maintain its original appearance was the locomotive. I think if the Empress Dowager thought of this, she would never allow the locomotive to not change its color.</p>
<p>What a pity! We couldn't have a yellow locomotive, dragging us, dashing back and forth in the wilderness of China. I still feel regretful to this day!</p>
<p>Although the Empress Dowager was determined to leave Beijing, she still had to teach the ministers in the court to express some opinions on this matter as usual. Whenever something more important happened, she always had to ask them for their opinions. (9)</p>
<h3 id="e199">New Life Movement <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Xun Zi</p>
<p>The New Life Movement, since its vigorous promotion by various parties, has recently reached a fever pitch.</p>
<p>The so-called New Life is about restoring China's inherent ancient virtues: propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame; and making life orderly, clean, and simple. When a rickshaw puller had his registration card taken away by an Indian policeman, he knelt down in the middle of the road, kowtowing to the Indian policeman like pounding garlic, repeatedly calling him "Officer." When we saw this, we didn't feel that the rickshaw puller was flattering foreigners or shameless; but felt he was oppressed by life and pitiable!</p>
<p>Looking at the many Jiangbei shanties on the vacant land in Zhabei, one usually has to bend over to enter. When it rains or snows, people are practically crouching in the mud. This kind of life undoubtedly lacks the conditions for order and cleanliness. However, to remove this stain on Shanghai's face, it is necessary to plan well for the people in the shanties afterwards. It cannot be solved by setting a fire and burning everything to the ground.</p>
<p>Therefore, the foundation of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame is built on "sufficient clothing and food." Without clothing or food, how can one practice propriety, uphold righteousness, cultivate integrity, or understand shame? If you complain that their clothes are not neat and their diet is not clean, they will simply answer you with one sentence: "No money!" The ancients spoke of "frugality within propriety." For people living below the poverty line, poverty is real, and there is no room for frugality.</p>
<p>It is hoped that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and other gentlemen who advocate the New Life Movement will focus on the people's livelihood, and then improving life will not be a problem!</p>

<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>The meeting was over, and the noise was very loud. I followed the crowd out of the concert at the National "Music Academy," my ears still ringing. It seemed that the lingering sound of "La Traviata Drinking Song" still remained.</p>
<p>It was late, the wind was strong, and it was raining. The streetlights were a dispirited pale green, and several immature pine trees in the distance looked like someone was squatting and shivering. La Traviata wouldn't appear at this time, would she! I thought to myself.</p>
<p>I ran back to the dormitory in the rain, took off my clothes and went to sleep. But the sound in my ears was always restless and noisy, and I couldn't fall asleep no matter what.</p>
<p>Oh no! Could it be that La Traviata actually found me! Listen! What is that sound! Damn! How did she get here to "warm up her voice" again!</p>
<p>This is an old, clear day with an Eastern feel, let's enjoy ourselves while we can! Ah! If we have to have this beautiful scenery to enjoy ourselves, then we are utterly foolish and pitiful! Let's not mention what filial piety is, as long as everyone is comfortable and happy, and we don't care if the weather is good or not, as long as we are looking at the wine glass with smiling eyes, and the smiling eyes in the glass look at each other. Heaven makes wine and makes love, for the sake of Heaven and Earth Mother always loving each other. People say we are too muddleheaded in our dealings with the world, forget it! What's wrong with being muddleheaded? You can say what you want, and we'll do what we want. Even if you are the most powerful prosecutor, please come and look at our wine glasses! Ah! I guarantee that your heart will immediately turn around, and you will be filled with joy.</p>
<p>Some people say I'm "seeing ghosts" and pretending to be confused. Forget it! What's wrong with being muddleheaded?</p>
<p>But then again, Mr. Liu Bannong's translation is truly a perfect portrayal of the character of the "modern" Chinese! Mr. Liu is truly a "foresighted" "Chinese"!</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, the leg of the stool tripped over his thigh, and he almost fell flat on his face. If he hadn't known a few tricks and quickly supported himself against the wall, he probably would have had a bad fall. Gui Zhi's heart was filled with anxiety, but Zhao Weng was calm and composed, stood up straight, and said with a smile, "It's alright, I have my own ways." As he spoke, he walked back to his room, took three eggs, and went to the kitchen. Gui Zhi was really uneasy when she saw this. But she had already lied, so she couldn't say that her eyes weren't hurting. She just smiled and said, "Old sir, please rest, I would feel terribly guilty. How could I ask you to bother yourself?" Zhao Weng wouldn't listen and waited for Xiao Lin to boil the eggs and bring them over before eating. Gui Zhi ate the eggs, thinking, "The old sir is sincere, but I am being insincere. Strictly speaking, I'm letting him down." Therefore, after eating, she didn't dare to pretend to be sick and came with Xiao Lin to clear the dishes. Zhao Weng repeatedly waved his hand and said, "Why are you doing this? Being diligent doesn't depend on one or two days. You go and lie down. I have something to do and need to go out." Gui Zhi said it was alright and listened to Zhao Weng leaving on his own. Not long after, Zhao Weng came back with a paper package. Seeing Gui Zhi sitting in the hall, he stretched out the paper package from afar and smiled at her, "This is Hangzhou chrysanthemum. Take it and brew a pot of water to drink. If your eyes are inflamed, drinking a pot will help." Gui Zhi smiled and said, "I'm putting you to so much trouble." Zhao Weng didn't answer, and stretched his hand into his coat, fumbling for a long time, and took out a small porcelain bottle, pinched it with two fingers, and put it into Gui Zhi's hand, and said with a smile, "This is Dingzhou eye drops, it will help if you apply it, just take it and use it." Gui Zhi didn't expect her father-in-law to leave in a hurry after eating, only to buy medicine for her. This old man treats people with kindness, benevolence, and loyalty, without any other intentions, how could one not be grateful? At that time, she repeatedly thanked him and took the eye drops and chrysanthemum to the room. (360)</p>

<p>Women's clothing is constantly changing, of course. Not to mention clothing, even hair is constantly changing. Since last autumn, the most fashionable women in the world have returned to their natural brown color without adding any modifications. Indeed, the news from Paris has already eliminated platinum blonde. In general, people acknowledge that this color has been popular for too long. In the United States, where platinum hair bleaching is prevalent, people have first felt that it is no longer fashionable. The average woman in New York, since April, has even been making the entire American female population aim to express golden hair as a standard. At the same time, Broadway has raised the slogan "Let your hair grow naturally and hang down."</p>
<p>In London, if we make a comparison, the top-notch hairdressers in the West say this to people: "Women come to get their hair done, and they usually do what they like. But now they all say they no longer like short hair, because they want to grow it out and let it hang down behind their necks so that they can curl it up. This kind of curl is very light, otherwise they will find it too heavy. But because the only way to curl the hair up is to grow out the short hair! Therefore, short hair is going to be unfashionable in London now."</p>
<p>Now, very few women want to bleach their hair platinum blonde like before. Even if they like to bleach their hair like this, they don't like to use other colors either. Otherwise, they will have to spend a lot of time in the barber shop. Women want to grow their hair long, even very long, and they don't have to cut it, because they often wear hats when they go out, and the longer the hair, the bigger the hat can be.</p>

<p>The Benefits of Flying Kites</p>
<p>When spring comes, the most fashionable pastime is of course flying kites. Not to mention adults, even children know how to fly them, and they don't involve gambling, so they are more noble than other pastimes. Children who fly kites run and jump in the wild, which can increase their vitality and invigorate their spirits. In addition, the air in the wild is fresh and the scenery is beautiful, which can make children feel happy. Moreover, as long as you have hemp string and a kite, you can fly it once, twice, or countless times without spending any more money. It is the most economical pastime, no wonder the government officials are promoting kite flying this time!</p>
<p>How to Make Kites</p>
<p>The raw materials for making kites are only colored paper, bamboo, paste, and string. In Shanghai, the stores that sell kites are very expensive. In fact, you can just make them yourself. Use bamboo to make the frame, and paste on colored paper, and you're done. Simple hexagonal, octagonal, and nine-string kites can be made by anyone. More complex butterflies and centipedes can also be made by skilled people. It doesn't cost much money, but it must be made accurately, otherwise it won't fly high. If the kite is made with the same size top and bottom, then you need to use a tail. The bigger the wind, the more tails you need, but if it's bigger, you don't need a tail.</p>
<p>How to Attach Kite Lanterns</p>
<p>Flying kites also has various other fun things to do. First of all, kite lanterns. In the evening, you can attach kite lanterns. Colorful paper lanterns should be covered with lead sheet to prevent the wind from blowing them out. A small brick is tied below to prevent the wind from swinging them. This way, they can be attached to the kite string, and the distance must be uniform so that it looks neat from below. The number of lanterns depends on the size of the kite. If you attach too many, the kite will be unable to handle it and will fall. In Shanghai, some people use electric wires to attach red and green electric lights, but the weight must also be considered!</p>
<p>Bow-shaped Kite Harp</p>
<p>The kite harp is made of a bamboo strip, a piece of bamboo, or a silk ribbon. The bamboo strip is bent like a bow, and the bamboo strip or silk ribbon is used as the bowstring. Some are attached to the kite, and some are attached to the string, but the angle must be aligned with the wind direction, otherwise it will not sound. The kite harp, attached to the kite, fluctuates with the wind and emits undulating琴 sounds, rising and falling in the air, which you can hear from far away.</p>
<p>Gunpowder Made Sand</p>
<p>Use a strip of cotton paper to make a tube, put gunpowder and charcoal dust, ground finely, inside, tie one end tightly and tie it to the kite string, tie a fuse to the other end, light the fire and let the kite string out, and when the fuse lights the gunpowder and charcoal dust, the sky will scatter a sky of sparks, like a reversed firework tube. In the evening, it is a very interesting pastime, but if there are grass huts below, you must be careful, for fear of causing a fire, so this kind of pastime can only be tried in the open fields of the wilderness.</p>
<p>Other Varieties</p>
<p>I have already mentioned several kinds of kite pastimes in Shanghai, but in addition, there are several kinds such as flying疊鷂 [kites on kites], using red and green paper to make windmills, attaching them to the kite string, tying a string of firecrackers, lighting them, tying them to the string, and releasing them into the sky, crackling and popping... they are all very interesting pastimes!</p>

<h3 id="e206">Whether Japan Participates or Not, the Far East Games Will Be Held as Scheduled; Non-Athletic Association Secretary Issues Statement <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>(National News Agency, San Fernando, 10th) According to Li Jin Yan Nan, Secretary and Treasurer of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association, today, the Far Eastern Games have been decided to be held here next month, regardless of whether Japan participates or not, this purpose will not change. The association was very indignant after hearing that Japan intended to withdraw from the competition because the puppet state's participation was rejected. The Philippine side has already spent a lot of money preparing for the conference, so the conference will proceed as usual, whether Japanese athletes participate or not. According to news obtained here from Japan, it seems that the Japanese sports authorities believe that the Philippine side is obstructing the participation of the puppet Manchukuo. According to Li, the Philippine Athletic Association did not interfere in the above matter. Furthermore, Shi, Chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, told reporters that those involved in the Far Eastern Games have no need to fear. Even if the Japanese side refuses to participate, the association's income will certainly not be affected in any way, because the Chinese Chamber of Commerce believes that the Chinese side will fully support it.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Our Country Is Still Actively Preparing for the Far East Preliminaries; Track and Field Preliminary Officials Appointed; North China Athletes Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Preliminary Program to Be Announced Tomorrow <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The 10th Far Eastern Games, which is attracting worldwide attention, is facing many obstacles due to the Japanese insistence on bringing the puppet Manchukuo to participate in order to achieve its political goals. The responsibility for this lies with them. Our team is implementing its principles, and while engaging in negotiations with foreign countries, it is still actively carrying out all preliminary procedures to prepare for participation at that time. The Shenshi News Agency reporter is specially exploring and recording the preparations for the preliminary rounds as follows:</p>
<p>Convening the Competition Committee The Far East Games National Preliminary Committee will hold a meeting on the 13th to discuss all matters related to the preparation of the preliminary rounds, such as the selection method for the women's volleyball team and the appointment of selection committee members. There are a total of five competition committee members. In addition to Shen Siliang and Ma Yuehan, who are in Shanghai, Competition Chairman Wang Zhengting is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 13th. Xu Minhui and Wu Yunrui will also arrive as scheduled to attend.</p>
<p>Announcing the Preliminary Program The items for the preliminary rounds held in Shanghai this time include basketball, swimming, track and field, and all-around. Except for swimming, which is scheduled to be held simultaneously in Hong Kong and Shanghai starting on the 18th, the others, such as basketball, track and field, and all-around, will be held on the 14th and 15th. The referees and preliminary programs have been determined and can be announced tomorrow.</p>
<p>Athletes Gather in Shanghai Twenty-nine track and field and basketball athletes from North China arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 am yesterday and stayed at the Sichuan Road YMCA. They plan to practice when the weather clears up to relax their muscles. Athletes from Yu and E have also set off, and Jing and Zhe have also started their journeys. Lin Shaozhou, because he does not know whether the Far East Games will be held or not, sent a telegram to inquire. The Athletic Association has replied by telegram urging him to come quickly. It is estimated that it may not be possible to arrive as scheduled. The Qing sisters from Shanxi, Wang Qingqing, will come to Shanghai with their mother. It is feared that there will be no track and field athletes from Guangdong Province participating.</p>
<p>Track and Field Preliminary Officials Our country's track and field preliminary competition for the current Far East Games will be held on the 14th (Saturday) at the China Track and Field Stadium. Athletes from all provinces and cities will arrive within days. The Association has rushed to complete the cleaning of the venue and the necessary equipment. Letters of appointment have also been issued to the officials for each preliminary event. The list is compiled and listed below:</p>
<p>Chief Referee: Ma Yuehan; Chief Judge of Finish Line: Ma Yuehan; Chief Judge of Field Events: Xu Minhui; Administrator: Zhou Jiaji; Starter: Zhuang Xiangqing; Finish Line Judges: Wu Yunrui, Peng Sanmei, Qian Yiqin, Huang Zhongfu; Field Event Judges: Wang Fudan, Dong Chengkang, Wu Demao, Shen Kunnan, Peng Wenyu, Shao Rugan;</p>

<h3 id="e208">Japan Wants to Stop Participating in the Far East Games to Coerce the Philippines; Yamamoto's Second Report Arrives in Japan Advocating Stopping Participation in the Far East Games; Japan Sports Association Holds Meeting to Discuss and Decide to First Question the Philippine Islands <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo, 11th) The Sports Association's plenary meeting to discuss countermeasures for the Shanghai round-table conference was held yesterday at Misaka Koraku, attended by Vice President Hiraji, Chief Officer Takashima, and others, centering on Dr. Yamamoto's instructions, discussed everything, and considered the issue to be of great importance, unable to decide lightly.</p>
<p>Postponed for one day, member groups will gather opinions tonight at the Marunouchi Central Pavilion for a board meeting. Depending on the shape of the board meeting, Japan may not participate in the Taisho 6 Imperial Cup Far East Games due to the untrustworthy behavior of China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>(Japan Federation News, Tokyo, 11th) The Japan Sports Association received a report from Dr. Yamamoto in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 10th on the progress of the round-table conference. Association authorities decided to hold a plenary meeting tonight after receiving Yamamoto's second report to decide on Japan's final attitude on whether to participate in the Far East Games or not. According to general observation, things have come to this point, Japan's non-participation (not withdrawal) in the Far East Games cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>Yamamoto's Second Report (Japan Federation News, Tokyo, 11th) The second report from Representative Yamamoto, which the Sports Association was waiting for, was received on the morning of the 11th. The Sports Association released the content of its report at 2 pm, as follows:</p>
<p>Although the Philippine side has not signed a contract on the articles, it has already approved its membership at this meeting, and has suddenly taken a position of abstention on the issue of participation in the competition. It is impossible to find any sincerity in this situation. Japan no longer needs to have any sentimental feelings about the Far East Games, but it seems cowardly to disengage from the difficulties. In my opinion, it is appropriate not to participate.</p>
<p>Japan Sports Association Attitude (Japan Federation News, Tokyo, 11th) The Japan Sports Association suddenly adopted a strong attitude towards the issue of participating in the Far East Games. Because Dr. Yamamoto's reply also advocated that it would be appropriate not to participate, the attitude of the Sports Association has become increasingly hardened. It is said that participation in this Far East Games was originally for the sake of seeking international trust with the Philippines, and Japan has no benefit to speak of. Now that the Filipinos have adopted such an unreasonable attitude, Japan should have no need to participate. If the Filipinos change their attitude of reflection because the Japanese side does not participate, and approve the participation of the puppet organization, then it should be discussed separately. However, whether the original proposal not to participate will be cancelled at that time is still Japan's freedom. This kind of opinion seems very powerful. The general tone of the board meeting convened at 6 pm on the 11th was quite strong, so the resolution not to participate in the Far East Games should be considered final.</p>
<p>Japan Sports Association Questions the Philippine Islands (Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, Express Telegram, 11th) The Japan Sports Association's emergency board meeting to decide on Japan's attitude towards the Far East Games was held at Fan Nei House at 7 pm today. Based on Dr. Yamamoto's report, discussions were held, and as a result, it was decided to send a letter of inquiry to Vice President Bagas of the Philippine Sports Association, questioning the untrustworthy attitude of the Philippine Islands. After the reply arrives in Beijing, the attitude of whether or not to participate will be decided. Dr. Sugimura Yotaro has started drafting the letter of inquiry as chairman of the drafting committee.</p>
<h3 id="e209">International Volleyball Tournament Ends; China Champions; USA Loses All Three Sets; Awards Given and Dismissed <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The first Shanghai International Volleyball Tournament held by the West YMCA ended last night. As a result of the final between China and the United States, China won two consecutive sets, and the championship has been obtained. Chinese athletes were sharpening their fists and preparing for the third set, but the American team cheered and dispersed, admitting defeat. According to the rules, China won the set 15-0. There were more than 100 spectators. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Fifteen to Eleven</p>
<p>China 45 Fifteen to Ten United States 21</p>
<p>Fifteen to Zero</p>
<p>Losing First, Winning Later Although the American team was fierce, it had no way out under the Chinese players' thunderous kill shots. Chinese players' average personal skills, whether killing or saving the ball, are superb, making the audience marvel. However, they sometimes reveal panic and often lose points due to carelessness. They initially lost four points, and the formation was very disorganized. Afterwards, they tried their best to cheer up, tied it at six to six, and seven to seven, and then turned defeat into victory, reaching ten to seven. When China took the lead at fourteen to eleven, the stalemate was intense, and it was difficult for each to score. However, China finally won 15-11.</p>
<p>All the Way Smooth The second set rotated serves, and neither side made much progress for a long time. However, the American team's formation revealed flaws, unable to withstand the Chinese team's fierce attacks. Before long, the Chinese team won 6-1. Although the American team managed to regain the right to serve several times, it had no chance to score. The Chinese team advanced steadily, taking the lead at 13-1, thinking it would be easy to finish it in one go. Unexpectedly, they lost the wind due to carelessness, and the American team soared up, 13-7, 14-9, before finally winning 15-10 and winning the championship. The United States forfeited the third set.</p>
<p>Team Scores In this competition, scores are not counted, but sets are counted. The Chinese team only lost one set to the United States. The United States failed to maintain the lead in the kill. The United States lost one set to both the Russian expatriates and the Jewish team, and lost three sets to the Chinese team. In terms of strength, the United States is no match for China. The Federation stopped fighting midway and was considered a complete defeat. The scores of each team are as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name Total Matches Won Lost Percentage</p>
<p>(1) China 12 11 1 set ·917</p>
<p>(2) United States 12 7 sets 5 sets ·583</p>
<p>(3) Russia 12 7 sets 5 sets ·583</p>
<p>(4) Jewish 12 5 sets 7 sets ·417</p>
<p>(5) Federation 12 0 sets 12 ·000</p>
<p>Chinese Team Members Cao Tingzan (Captain), Qiu Xie, Chen Baoqiu, Xu Heng, Chen Zongqi, Wei Dingyi, Xie Xianshang, Cai Tiange, Chen Bingde (Coach) American Team Hagman, George Lee, Nelson, Baden, Brand, Cole,</p>
<p>Awards Given and Dismissed After the competition, an awards ceremony was held, chaired by Topping, Director of Sports at the West YMCA, and awards were presented by Dr. McLagan. Dr. McLagan first made a brief speech and then gave the awards. The first was a large silver cup for the International Volleyball Championship, which was received by Chen Bingde. The second was the West YMCA Volleyball League Championship, which was won by Jinjiang Bay, receiving a large silver cup, which was received by Cao Tingzan. The next was the West YMCA Basketball A Group Championship, which was a large silver ball, extremely beautiful, won by the Pirates, and each person was awarded a small silver cup. The next was the B Group Championship, a large silver cup, won by Xinyang, and the next was the Women's Basketball Championship, won by Liangjiang. In addition to the large silver cup, each player was given a small silver shield, which was received by Chen Rongming and Yang Sen. They cheered and dispersed.</p>

<p>China Team Two Points... Western Team Three Points</p>
<p>The Fourth Public Exhibition Cup International Handball Tournament, the first day of the first week, opened yesterday at 5:30 PM in West Qing. A total of five matches were played.</p>
<p>In the first singles match, Zhu Kuan (China) defeated the Western champion, Mr. Luo, after three intense games. In the third and fifth singles matches, our players Hong and Sun had superior skills compared to their opponents, but they lacked stamina and were unable to sustain the effort, leading to their defeats.</p>
<p>It was deeply regrettable. In the seventh singles match, Mr. An (West) had better momentum and won two games in a row. In the ninth singles match, our player Hua Fenggang was young and fierce. Although he lost the first game, he defeated Mr. Ge (West) in the second and third games, resulting in a score of China 2, West 3. There are still five matches today.

<p>The annual basketball league organized by the Shanghai Secondary School Athletic Federation was originally approved to be held at the Chinese Basketball Hall. Unexpectedly, the Basketball Hall was destroyed by fire, preventing the original plan from being realized. Yesterday, the</p>
<p>Federation's Basketball Committee members Jiang Jingnan, Wu Shijie, and Liu Wenxiao (Lu Xiangqiandai) held a meeting at the Coordination Association to discuss remedial measures. It was decided that all matches could only be held at various schools. In addition to the original competition regulations, the following items have been added, and the competition schedule has been shortened. They are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Time: The competition will begin on the 18th of this month and end on the 22nd. The dates for the finals for the Chinese and Physical Education groups will be determined separately by the committee. Each match will start at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>(2) Location: The competition venue will be changed to various schools. If it is held at School A this year, it will be held at School B next time. The finals venue will be changed to a public location.</p>
<p>(3) Referees: The home team is responsible for hiring referees. The home team is responsible for the transportation costs. It is hoped that all schools will prepare early to avoid delays.</p>
<p>(4) Postponement: If the competition cannot be held at the scheduled time and venue due to rain, wet ground, or special circumstances, it must be completed between the 23rd and 29th of this month. However, postponement due to any reason requires the consent of the other party. Postponement due to wet ground must be notified to the opposing team in the morning. If both parties can negotiate to borrow an indoor basketball hall, that is also acceptable.</p>
<p>(5) Reports: The home team is responsible for submitting a written report of the results of the match to Basketball Chairman Jiang Jingnan (Guanghua University, Da Xi Road) on the same evening for reference.

<p>Huadong Girls' High School on Beile Road in this city is known for its efforts to promote sports. This semester, in addition to the original sports instructor, Xu Jiazeng, continuing to guide various sports, Hu Zongfan has also been hired as a ball sports instructor. It is expected that the school's various ball skills will improve further. In addition, due to the increase in students, the existing school buildings are insufficient. The school principal, Ma Jiazhen, in order to consolidate the school's foundation, discussed with the board of directors to actively raise funds to build a school building. It is heard that drawings have already been completed and bidding will begin soon. The construction plan will be carried out in stages. The first step of construction will cost approximately 40,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the Zhenjiang communication in your newspaper's sports column on the 27th of this month, which stated that students from our school's military academy beat a referee during a basketball game, upon reading it, we were extremely surprised. On that day (the 17th), when the Leiming team, composed of military academy students from our school's training team, was playing against the Xiaoniao team, the referee, Zhou Mingzhang, misunderstood the rules and made an unfair judgement. The team's players asked for an explanation and temporarily stopped the game. At that time, Mr. Yuan Zhongkang, director of the guidance department of the Provincial Sports Ground, acknowledged that Mr. Zhou did not understand the rules and made an unfair judgement. He was willing to apologize to our school's basketball team in writing or in the newspaper on behalf of the Provincial Sports Ground and his personal reputation. Our platoon leader, Huang, believed that the matter was minor, and since the director knew that Mr. Zhou's judgment was unfair, our school could give him due understanding in order to preserve Mr. Zhou's reputation and bring the matter to a close. At that time, our team only sent two representatives to ask Mr. Zhou for an explanation, and did not enter the room. The facts are all there and can be easily distinguished. How could it be said that the door was broken down and they rushed into the room? Furthermore, our school does not have a Wang instructor. Although platoon leader Huang was present</p>
<p>, the mistake was not on our side, and there was no apology. How could it be said that an oral apology was made through Instructor Wang? To investigate the referee, if the referee's judgment is unfair, it is common for players to ask for an explanation. At that time, everyone was watching, and the facts were all there. How could one fabricate facts and make false statements afterwards? The above situation is only a general summary. The details at that time cannot be described one by one. Because what your newspaper published does not match the facts, we are afraid of causing confusion. We hereby request that you investigate and correct it in your newspaper immediately. Sincerely, Dianlei School Training Team, attached by Xu Shidan, March 29th.</p>

<p>(1) It has been found that the city is able to expand compulsory primary schools, but the equipment in each school is mostly simple, and the teaching methods are also mostly rigid. Both should be improved. The bureau should designate compulsory primary schools with better management to compile reports on the management process, graduate performance, and all difficult problems within a reasonable period of time, and report them to the ministry for inspection. Alternatively, well-equipped and well-managed primary schools should be designated to pilot compulsory primary schools and two-part full-day systems to observe their performance and</p>
<p>consider how to promote them. At the same time, efforts should be made to expand primary schools so that all school-age children in the city have the opportunity to attend school.</p>
<p>(2) The school buildings in the city are mostly simple and not very suitable, which affects educational facilities and children's safety. The bureau should earnestly plan methods to improve them.</p>
<p>(3) In recent years, many primary schools in the city have implemented corporal punishment to make up for the shortcomings of educational methods. However, the impact is ultimately negative. Each school should be clearly informed to avoid using corporal punishment and adopt other appropriate corrective methods to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>(4) The desks and chairs in the city's primary school classrooms are issued by the bureau, but the styles are often unsuitable and the materials are not strong. They often need to be repaired soon after being used, which is not economical. Methods should be found to improve them.</p>
<p>(5) The teaching equipment in public and private secondary schools, except for the biology and books in Anhui Middle School, the physics and chemistry in Zhongying Middle School and Zhongda Shixiao, the books in Jinling Girls' Middle School, the home affairs in Huiwen Girls' Middle School, and the drawing and labor in the Municipal No. 1 Middle School, is mostly simple. Teaching methods not only tend to focus on lectures and indoctrination in language and social science subjects, but also lack appropriate automatic and experimental work in natural science subjects. Teachers generally lack sufficient teaching and research spirit and should be addressed and improved separately.</p>
<p>(6) The number of students in each class in private secondary schools often reaches seventy or eighty, which is detrimental to teaching management, and the fees charged exceed the prescribed limits significantly. Strict restrictions should be imposed to improve educational efficiency and reduce the burden on students.</p>
<p>(7) Youth guidance is an urgent task of secondary school education. Apart from the Municipal No. 1 Middle School and Zhonghua Girls' Middle School, which have considerable facilities, most schools in the city have not paid attention to it. In addition, the responsibility for moral education in each school is still mostly borne by one or two moral education staff members, while teachers are ignored. The regulations on the integration of moral education and teaching in the secondary school curriculum promulgated by the Ministry of Education should be strictly implemented.</p>
<p>(8) The purpose of labor education is to acquire real skills and experience from practical activities and to cultivate the habit of diligence among young people. It should be carried out earnestly. Apart from Zhongda Shixiao, the Municipal No. 1 Middle School, and Huiwen Girls' Middle School, which pay attention to it, most schools in the city are perfunctory. They have neither venues nor tools, and use simple rattan work and wire work as their only work. Some do not even offer this subject, such as Zhongnan Middle School. Each school should be ordered to improve separately.</p>
<p>(9) There are a large number of private secondary schools in the city. The bureau should carefully assess a few schools with satisfactory performance starting from the 23rd academic year and provide appropriate</p>
<p>subsidies to encourage them.</p>
<p>(10) Private secondary schools have limited financial resources, and it is practically difficult for them to immediately convert to vocational schools. The bureau should consider the situation of each school and order them to pilot vocational courses, vocational supplementary classes, or convert to primary schools, and provide subsidies to excellent schools to encourage them.</p>
<p>(11) Private schools are able to make efforts to improve their facilities before applying for registration, but after approval, they often gradually become lax. Therefore, unregistered schools should be strictly banned, and registered schools should be subject to serious assessment and supervision at all times to meet the current standards.</p>
<p>(12) The focus of educational inspection is guidance. According to the school authorities in the city, "The Social Affairs Bureau inspectors inspect the school once per semester, but often do not express their opinions during the inspection and rarely provide reports on guidance and improvement." Attention should be paid to this in the future.</p>
<p>(13) The Nanjing Private Art College has not yet completed the registration procedures. The bureau has been ordered to instruct them to comply. It has been found that the school buildings are simple and very unsuitable, and the equipment and funds are insufficient. The bureau should order them to find ways to improve the content, raise funds, and rebuild the school buildings, and urge them to complete the registration procedures as soon as possible for verification and deprivation.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Zhou Houxu Talks About the Impressions of Studying Education in Japan (II) <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>(3) General military training is strictly enforced from middle school upwards. Military instructors are directly appointed by the Ministry of the Army, and students absolutely obey their instructors, fearing them like tigers. Instructors can arbitrarily whip students who do not perform well in military training. Each school has live-fire drills and live ammunition shooting,</p>
<p>field exercises, night exercises, etc. Students usually wear uniforms and hats. Boys are not allowed to keep their hair long and salute teachers. All aspects of life are like soldiers. Youths outside of school between the ages of sixteen and twenty-five are given strict military, vocational, and civic training at night by youth training centers. There are nearly 20,000 youth training centers across the country, mostly using primary and secondary school buildings. In addition, the organization of youth groups and juvenile groups also has military implications in times of national emergency. Japan pays such widespread attention to military training that in the event of an emergency, the entire country becomes soldiers. The Qing Dynasty Shrine seen in Tokyo, the Junior National Exhibition Hall seen in Baozuka, the National Defense Exhibition Hall, the Local History Exhibition Hall, etc., display various modern war tools, scientific weapons, comparisons of military power of various countries, the glorious history of Japan's foreign wars, and war trophies, as well as the great achievements of military men in defending the country. All of this encourages its citizens to study war, prepare for national defense, and participate in foreign aggression, which is truly shocking. Military training is now offered as a course in many schools in our country, but it is often perfunctory. Instructors cannot command, and students do not know how to obey. After many years, there have been few tangible results. The general public is numb and ignorant of the impending disaster. What is national defense? Our government should quickly establish military service and military training control measures, and the people should recognize their responsibilities, the danger of the situation, and quickly engage in military training and preparations for national defense.</p>
<p>(4) Cultivating diligent habits Japanese women have always been known for their diligence. In girls' schools, emphasis is placed on household chores. The equipment for students to practice sewing, cooking, washing, dyeing, gardening, home economics, hygiene, etc. is available from elementary school to university. The supervision of students is also very strict. In addition to regular classes, daily life, such as cooking, sweeping, and all school management chores, are done by students in rotation. The floors are spotless and the glass is crystal clear. The girls' schools we visited mostly do not use servants, and students handle everything themselves. In contrast, the manufacturing of dual-material young ladies in our country's girls' schools is truly incomparable. As for boys' schools, most of the sweeping and other chores are also done by students. Middle schools with more than a thousand students often only use five or six school workers, at most ten. Their training of young people in diligent habits is like this. Our country's habit of idleness is the biggest problem, and education has also mistakenly gone down the path of creating pampered youth. To cure this disease, we must make every effort to promote diligence in schools. This is what we should emulate from that country.</p>
<p>(5) Promoting production education In schools at all levels, the teaching materials for each subject,</p>
<p>all emphasize the country's resources, economic development, and knowledge and skills of agriculture and industry, in order to improve the methods of production. Vocational schools across the country teach production knowledge and skills. The five-year middle school engineering courses we visited were already able to manufacture extremely sophisticated machinery, electrical machinery, clocks, physical and chemical instruments, radio tubes, cosmetics, high-quality furniture, dyed and woven silk fabrics, Western-style sculptures, architecture, etc. Students in these schools can do anything that skilled craftsmen can make. Graduates of vocational schools at all levels are quite popular with society, and demand exceeds supply, especially those who operate their own factories and farms. In addition to vocational courses, universities and specialized schools also have vocational teacher training centers. For the general public to improve their living skills, supplementary night schools are attached to various vocational schools. Japanese vocational education aims to solve people's livelihoods, increase production, and enrich national strength on the one hand, and to enable students to develop outwards and manufacture goods to sell in foreign markets, especially in our country, as an important destination. For example, the fabrics dyed and woven by Kyoto Industrial School are the general-purpose printed cloth for our people, and the light bulbs manufactured are the general-purpose 200-volt long light bulbs used throughout our country, clearly marked for use by Chinese people. Students should strive to learn how to manufacture and sell them. After our visit, we couldn't help but feel terrified. Recently, various parties in our country have been advocating vocational education or life education, but many have not paid attention to the needs of society, the adequacy of equipment, and the training of teachers. This should be considered carefully. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(Jinan Communication) The Ministry of Education previously issued a circular ordering schools in various provinces and cities to change the method of paying teachers' teaching salaries, prohibiting calculation by clock hours, and uniformly changing to monthly salaries. Previously, principals who held concurrent classes and received salaries will also be changed so that principals who hold concurrent classes for ten hours will not be paid. Many provinces are now implementing this, but because it is difficult to change suddenly in this province, it is still under consideration. The Ministry of Education is urging them to comply quickly. The Education Department has specially convened principals of provincial secondary schools and above to Shanghai to hold a meeting to study the implementation method. The meeting was held in the Education Department conference room at 9:00 AM today (the 9th). The attendees included Cai Fuyuan, the head of the First Normal School; Lin Shuyong, the principal of the Second Normal School; Wang Baolian, the principal of the First Women's Normal School; Qian Zhendong, the principal of the First Rural Normal School; Dong Fengchen, the principal of the Second Rural Normal School; Xiong Xiushan, the principal of the Fifth Rural Normal School; Chang Zizhong, the principal of the Sixth Rural Normal School; Song Huanwu, the principal of the High School; Meng Xianji, the principal of the First Vocational School; Ma Tingliang, the principal of the Second Vocational School; Wang Chaodong, the principal of the Third Vocational School; Hu Ganqing, the acting principal of the First Middle School; Hong Peiyuan, the principal of the Fourth Middle School; Yan Renpei, the principal of the Seventh Middle School; Su Jizhou, the principal of the First Women's Middle School; Sun Qingshan, the principal of the Twelfth</p>

The attendees from the Education Department included Wang Ziyu, the chief secretary; Liu Cipian, the secretary; Kong Lingcan, the head of the First Section; Qi Luxiang, the staff member; Lai Zhizhong, the head of the Second Section; Kong Eryi, the staff member; Zhang Zicai, the staff member; and Yang Mengyuan from the Audit Committee. Wang Ziyu presided over the meeting. During the discussion of the reform methods, it was decided to divide the review into four groups due to the many difficulties in suddenly reforming: the high school normal school group, the junior high school group, the vocational school group, and the rural normal school group. The principals will review in groups and present the review results for discussion at the Education Department at 9:00 AM tomorrow (the 10th).</p>
<h3 id="e223">Jiangsu Education Department Orders Zhenjiang County Education Bureau to Improve <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an order to Zhenjiang County Education Bureau, stating that according to investigation reports, the county's various social education institutions still have many areas that need improvement. These are listed separately as follows:</p>
<p>㈠ Modao Lane Public Education Center:</p>
<p>1. The center's premises are narrow, the light is dark, and the floor is damp, which is not suitable for use. Methods should be devised to improve this.</p>
<p>2. The purpose of livelihood surveys is to compare production quantity with consumption quantity. The center's livelihood surveys lack clear records of both production and consumption quantities. A detailed investigation should be conducted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>3. Illiterates in the basic education area account for one-half of the total population. According to statistical results, most of the illiterate are women. Future promotion of language education should pay attention to women.</p>
<p>4. The people in the area cannot sincerely accept various educations. This is because there are too few opportunities for contact on weekdays. In the future, methods should be devised to establish practical contact with the people.</p>
<p>5. Very few urban residents are physically strong, which is due to a lack of exercise opportunities. The original national martial arts training class in the center should be restored as soon as possible.</p>
<p>㈠ Baoyan Town Farmer Education Center:</p>
<p>1. Transportation in Baoyan is inconvenient, and news is delayed. The center plans to raise funds to install a wireless radio receiver, which should be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>2. The existing charts in the center mostly contain statistics from various countries around the world. Statistical charts concerning this country, this province, this county, and this district are still lacking and should be added immediately.</p>
<p>3. Public schools should be held entirely within the basic education area to eliminate illiteracy.</p>
<p>4. The streets of Baoyan Town are dirty, which is detrimental to hygiene. A township improvement association should be organized as soon as possible, and local forces should be used to guide each household to clean diligently and to ban the free-range raising of livestock such as pigs and sheep.</p>
<p>5. There are occasional armed conflicts among the people. This trend should be jointly addressed and eliminated by local party and government agencies.</p>
<p>㈢ Huashan Farmer Education Center:</p>
<p>1. The center has been established for five years, and the director has been changed six times, resulting in a complete loss of public trust. Future work should start with the most important and urgent aspects for farmers in order to awaken public sympathy.</p>
<p>2. Low-lying fields are suitable for growing rice, and high-lying fields are suitable for growing miscellaneous grains. However, local farmers only like to grow rice, regardless of the height of the field, which not only results in a poor harvest, but sometimes no grain at all. Special attention should be paid to guiding the improvement of agricultural practices in the future.</p>
<p>3. The center's basic education area includes six villages, including Huashan, Tangcun, Shangshe, and Shiqiao, with 1,200 households and a population of approximately 5,000, which is too large and should be reduced immediately.</p>
<p>4. The 20 mu of public property in Pingchang City that local people previously designated should still be recovered for use as a model farm.</p>
<p>5. Most of the students in public schools are students from private schools who come here for remedial study, which is inconsistent with the original purpose of running public schools. The number of women in the daytime class is too small, and both should be improved.</p>
<p>The above points should be conveyed separately for improvement, and the progress of the improvement should be reported for review and order. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Hurry Up and Protect Production Enterprises <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Natural</p>
<p>In this era of foreign goods dumping and rampant Japanese goods, the most unfortunate news is the frequent labor strikes in domestic goods factories over the past month, creating opportunities for the sales of foreign and Japanese goods, which is truly heartbreaking. However, the government is watching this situation as if it were a fire across the river, perfunctorily dealing with it, resulting in a situation that is getting worse and worse, inevitably leading to the closure and suspension of many factories. This is such a sad thing. In this helpless situation, I suddenly saw a public notice from Chairman Chiang, earnestly advocating the elimination of labor-capital disputes and the enrichment of production capacity. When workers go on strike for no reason, the competent authority may order the dissolution of the labor union to quickly resolve the issue, but factory owners are also not allowed to mistreat workers, and so on. This straightforward order is indeed a key way to protect production enterprises and resolve capital disputes. If the authorities of each province and city government can deeply understand Chairman Chiang's intentions and strictly enforce them, find ways to ban and suppress them, so that those who run factories can work with peace of mind, and the budding domestic goods industry can slowly develop, and can compete with foreign and Japanese goods. Otherwise, a glimmer of hope is also hopeless, and sooner or later China will be occupied by foreign and Japanese merchants. The China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association issued a notice yesterday endorsing Chairman Chiang's protection of production, stating that "Labor strikes are frequent, which is heartbreaking to say. In many cases, the matter is very small and can be resolved immediately, but it is only because there are people inciting behind the scenes that it often involves months and days. The crux of the matter is that every labor strike is controlled by a small number of manipulators and blackmailers, who use ignorant workers as a tool for their own use, resulting in a lose-lose situation. The factory is unable to support itself, and the workers also lose their livelihood, making future entrepreneurs see setting up a factory as a dangerous path and dare not try it rashly." These many painful and profound words, the general manipulating blackmailing in the middle sow the seeds of dissension of the elements, conscience fruit in, don't want to be the great sinners of national goods, also should suddenly realize, transfer the technique of inciting, come together to maintain the livelihood of the pitiable workers and support the endangered national goods industry. Perhaps China's national goods factory still has a place to exist. The general public will not be reduced to starvation. And those in charge of administration should also use a quick knife to cut through the mess to deal with this continuous labor tide as soon as possible, in order to maintain the only vitality of the place and the opportunity for workers' lives. This is what the reporter said with tears, and dares to pray for the national goods industry.</p>
<p>National Goods Talk</p>
<h3 id="e231">Talking about Current Affairs <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>The current affairs I want to talk about are the rampant "Modern Destruction Group." They are dedicated to destroying modern clothing, and their weapons of destruction are said to be "sprinkling sulfuric acid." This swift and thunderous method is enough to shock young men and women who like to be modern!</p>
<p>However, on closer thought, there are many illogical aspects to them! First, is the word "modern" reasonable? Second, do their executors have the ability to distinguish whether goods are domestic? Third, is sprinkling sulfuric acid reasonable? Fourth, is sulfuric acid a domestic product? Now, let's talk about these four points. First, "modern" means "contemporary," which is in line with modernization and is a very trendy thing, but it is not reprehensible. Second, there are many Chinese-made modern wool and silk fabrics. Even experts may find it difficult to distinguish them at a glance. I think that they, driven by momentary righteous indignation, certainly do not have the ability to distinguish them very well! If they think that something is modern and not a domestic product and destroy it, but that person is wearing clothes made of authentic domestic wool or silk, wouldn't they be wronged and suffer an unprovoked disaster? Third, it is said that sulfuric acid can not only destroy clothes, but also corrode the skin. Then, even if their clothes are modern foreign goods, it is inhumane for their bodies to be harmed for no reason, isn't it? Fourth, it is said that there is no sulfuric acid made in China yet! Then, they have already violated the tenet of "promoting domestic goods."</p>
<p>I think it is better to actively build than to passively destroy. How to build? I will contribute a little foolishness. Whether in each village or town, you can hold a "National Goods Consumption Association." Their responsibility is to "diligently persuade people to use domestic goods," starting from each member's family, then extending to relatives and friends, and then spreading from relatives and friends to relatives and friends, gradually reaching remote rural areas. There will be "National Goods Consumption Associations" everywhere. In this way, wouldn't there be no need for passive destruction? According to the plan of the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, in a few years, Chinese national goods companies can be seen everywhere in the country, which means that Chinese people can buy Chinese goods everywhere.</p>
<p>Also, destroying people's modern clothing in this way is in danger of violating criminal law. No wonder Director Wang wants to explicitly prohibit it!</p>
<h3 id="e232">Talking about the Modern Destruction Group <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Although the import of foreign goods has increased year by year, its sales path is entirely in large cities, and its patrons are entirely people in the intellectual community. Look at the modern men in suits and leather shoes, and the modern women with fluffy hair. Which one of them, from head to toe, is not a foreign product? But aren't they knowledgeable? Why don't they love the country like this? Alas! It's also pitiful to say! They are deeply poisoned by modernity! They think that they cannot be called modern if they don't do this. Modern, modern, you are really harmful!</p>
<p>According to a special telegram from Hangzhou published in the newspaper, "The Modern Destruction Group was discovered in Hangzhou City and appeared in various amusement venues every night. Western suits and women's foreign coats have been cut, affecting more than a thousand people." This is really a gratifying thing. The only way to deal with these people who only know how to be modern and don't know how to love the country is to use this method to deal with them. However, in terms of law, I am afraid it is illegal again. Therefore, this method can only be happy for a while, and should not be taken as an example. I think the best thing is to carve a few turtle seals and stamp them on anyone who wears foreign goods. And use indelible oil. Print it on them so that they can't wear it again. In this way, it may be possible to achieve some results in promoting national goods, which is much better than just shouting for promotion without actually doing it. Readers, what do you think?</p>
<p>Home Visit Record</p>
<h3 id="e233">Mrs. Cai Zimin <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Qiacheng</p>
<p>I remember one snowy winter morning I visited Mr. Cai Zimin to ask about issues of youth cultivation. Now, on a chilly spring afternoon, I visited Mrs. Cai. Originally, Mrs. Cai Zhou Jun, had already expressed many opinions on the issue of national goods at meetings during this year of National Goods for Women. However, because we wanted to introduce every female leader who is engaged in promoting the national goods movement, and especially to introduce everyone's opinions on their work in the process of this work, I finally went to the west of Shanghai to pay my respects.</p>
<p>The guest room was very quiet, and the simple arrangement contained a sense of beauty. In front of the window and on the ground were scattered several potted plants that were in bloom. On the wall were several oil paintings accompanied by a six-foot-long portrait of Mr. Cai, and only one pair of five-character seal couplets by Mr. Wu Zhihui remained from the spring. The impression given to us here was not vulgarity with a lot of red and green, but another kind of elegance.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Cai walked in, she was wearing clothes made of domestic cloth, and her attitude was dignified and her speech was decisive and powerful.</p>
<p>We immediately talked about the Shanghai Women's National Goods Association, which was an organization that had been established many years ago. The members were housewives from intellectual families. Although many members have now gone to other places, Mrs. Cai, Mrs. Pan, Mrs. Li Haoran, and Mrs. Shen are still continuing their efforts. This association was organized before the Year of National Goods and the Year of National Goods for Women. The regulations and covenants were very strict, but Mrs. Cai has always adhered to them. When I asked how the Year of National Goods for Women could complete its great mission, Mrs. Cai replied, "In addition to the efforts of women to promote it, many things that relate to the overall situation need to be assisted and carried out by the state and society!"</p>
<p>"Because it is human nature to love cheapness, the fundamental solution is for the government to increase taxes on imported goods and at the same time reduce transit taxes on domestic products. This is much more effective than promoting domestic goods by mouth!" At the same time, to supplement the above reasons, she said with sadness and indignation, "Now Oriental goods are actually cheaper than domestic goods!"</p>
<p>Regarding the work of the Year of National Goods for Women, Mrs. Cai advocated adopting a persuasion approach. The current persuasion can only reach a relatively close part. The method of promotion should focus on activities in women's groups and girls' schools. For example, if a school has 100 female students who fully accept and agree with it, each person can persuade her own family, which is actually equivalent to persuading 100 families. At the time, she also talked about reaching out to female workers in factories. However, facts tell us that, due to economic reasons, it is mostly the intellectual class, the so-called upper class, who promote foreign goods. Therefore, she advocated that we should have a concept of ""it is shameful to use foreign goods, and it is respectable to use domestic goods even if they are not beautiful"", and build up such a public mentality!</p>
<p>Finally, Mrs. Cai summarized her opinions: 1. I hope that the government will raise tariffs on imported goods and engage in practical promotion of domestic goods from an economic perspective; 2. I hope that the industrial and commercial sectors will investigate domestic and imported goods separately so that those engaged in promotion will have reliable information; 3. In addition, women should work hard to do this during the Year of National Goods for Women. Only in this way is it possible to achieve success!</p>
<p>If you want to buy imported goods, go to a cooperative shop and ask!</p>

<h3 id="e234">New Life Uniforms and National Goods <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Zuizhu</p>
<p>The New Life Movement has been going on for only a month now, and its vigorous atmosphere has spread throughout the country. Its progress has also gradually moved from words to facts.</p>
<p>The covenants that stipulate the new life in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation have also been seen in newspapers. If they can be implemented accordingly, then there will be a brand new look in a short period of time, and the effect of changing customs and habits will be achieved.</p>
<p>However, there is one more thing that no one seems to have mentioned; and it is actually very necessary, which is…</p>
<p>"People engaged in the New Life should have a symbol – a uniform."</p>
<p>"The city likes high buns, and the four sides are one foot high." This is indeed the ironclad proof of "what those above like, those below will like even more"; but if those who like high buns only "like it in their hearts" and do not "comb a high bun" to show people, well, there will definitely not be a great effect of "four sides are one foot high" in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Assuming that we use "national material Zhongshan suits" as the uniform for people engaged in the New Life Movement, then there are at least the following benefits.</p>
<p>First, wearing a uniform requires one to restrain one's actions at all times and arouse a sense of self-esteem; at least, one does not dare to be romantic, dirty, or frivolous, because one is being watched.</p>
<p>Second, demonstrate to others and arouse the admiration of society, and think about imitating and reforming. At least, make those who do not wear uniforms (i.e., those who do not lead a new life) feel ashamed and reflect inwardly.</p>
<p>Third, domestic goods can sell well, because there is a uniform everywhere that restrains his actions and reminds his conscience. At least, domestic cloth and silk can be popular, and foreign goods can not be bought. Fourth, the spirit of cleanliness and simplicity can be fully expressed in the uniform; one can monitor each other's words and deeds to see if they are "practicing the New Life"; one can give society a fresh impression and make the New Life Movement advance faster.</p>
<p>If it is not stipulated that "people in the New Life must wear uniforms," then the benefits mentioned above will become harm. For example, the first item above becomes…</p>
<p>"Not wearing a uniform, there is no need to restrain one's hands, and it will not arouse a sense of self-esteem. You can still be romantic... because you are not being watched."</p>
<p>Wouldn't this kind of New Life that is not responsible for others or oneself be loose and empty?</p>
<p>Therefore, to promote domestic goods, we must vigorously implement the New Life, and to vigorously implement the New Life, we must stipulate the use of uniforms. These three things seem to be unrelated, but in fact they are interlinked.</p>
<p>What year is it for these tasteless things?</p>

<h3 id="e235">Elementary School Teachers Have Increased Responsibilities <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Natural</p>
<p>The Japanese love to use domestic goods, not to mention men and women, even children. I dare say that every child now refuses to use non-domestic goods. I saw this situation in Japan with my own eyes. I still remember that I visited a kimono shop in Japan, and several twelve- or thirteen-year-old children went to the shop to buy things. They picked and picked, and after picking the goods they liked, they repeatedly asked the shop assistant if they were made in Japan. There was a family whose mother dressed a child in non-domestic clothes, and the child was reprimanded by the teacher and ridiculed by his classmates at school. As a result, he tore his clothes, cried and went home, and told his mother that she should not have made him such an unpatriotic outfit and lost face. This spirit of loving and using domestic goods, I do not say that the children are good, I still attribute it to the elementary school teachers. The recent promotion of domestic goods by the Chinese people can be said to be extremely lively, especially the recent Children's Day. The liveliness of this day seems to indicate that China's future is very promising. I say that this is not just catching up with the fun, it is writing a contract, it is a contract that increases the responsibility of elementary school teachers. From now on, the responsibilities of mothers will naturally increase, and the responsibilities of elementary school teachers will be even greater. Elementary school teachers! What are you teaching, what should you be teaching, your responsibilities will be increased from now on.</p>

<h3 id="e236">A Few Points to Eliminate Hatred of Goods <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Diao</p>
<p>"Promoting National Goods" and "Consuming National Goods" are resounding slogans that are making a lot of noise; but I ask you, is the hatred of foreign goods completely eliminated? Are modern girls using them? I can conclude that with this kind of high-profile promotion, foreign goods are still being imported like sweat.</p>
<p>What do you mean by high-profile promotion? It means that on the surface, people are very enthusiastic, but in secret they are the biggest customers of foreign goods. With this kind of promotion, can foreign goods not disappear? If you want them to disappear, you must do the following.</p>
<p>1. Set an example… Dr. Shao Shuangqiu, when he promoted the local goods movement, he actually "set an example" by wearing local goods, just like a worker. When he went out to visit and give speeches, even if he was looked down upon, his spirit did not diminish. I hope that the concubines and young ladies of the current authorities and the leaders of all sectors can all be like Dr. Shao, "set an example", and guarantee that unscrupulous merchants will sell foreign goods? If it can be implemented, I think a group of compatriots will definitely use them, and will never have the face to sell them again, right?</p>
<p>2. Abandon the concept of foreign goods… When using domestic goods for the first time, there must be some modern people who are still reluctant to part with foreign goods and do not want to use domestic goods; because domestic goods are not as gorgeous as foreign goods, and they want to reduce their beautiful appearance. "You must know that domestic goods have the beauty of domestic goods, and foreign goods have the beauty of foreign goods." You must never have the concept that foreign goods must be beautiful. I hope that first-time users will quickly abandon this concept, or else how can they universally "consume domestic goods"?</p>
<p>3. Cheap domestic goods… When "promoting domestic goods", I hope that national goods merchants will sell them at a low price as soon as possible, and never worry about losing money; the sacrifice now is the development in the future. Because we want to make a group of people especially cheap when they are transitioning to "consuming domestic goods", and improve the goods; in this way, I think we can get a group of people to like to buy domestic goods.</p>
<p>The above points are also old sayings, but if you compatriots can do this, the great effect it will have will definitely be great.</p>

<h3 id="e237">In Memory of a Practitioner of Promoting National Goods <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang Songmao, the general manager of the Five Continents Pharmacy, showed extraordinary intelligence from a young age, different from ordinary people. Growing up with great aspirations, he was forced by circumstances to abandon his studies and learn commerce. During his free time, he always had a book in hand, studying diligently. He inscribed a long couplet as his motto, which read, "In ordinary times, one should restrain desires to nourish the body, but in times of great adversity, one should accept fate and sacrifice life," and "In managing a family, one must live within one's means, but for the sake of righteousness, one should regard thousands of gold as insignificant." His selflessness is evident from this. After taking charge of Five Continents, he personally attended to every matter, never complaining about hardship or resentment. He once went to Japan to inspect the pharmaceutical industry. After returning to China, he purchased land to establish the Gubeng Soap Factory, Yalin Medicated Water Factory, and Dongwu Cotton Factory, hiring specialized personnel to research various products. He believed that relying on selling foreign goods resulted in the outflow of profits and rights. Therefore, it was necessary to invent new medicines oneself to benefit patients and prevent the loss of national wealth. He promoted national goods not with empty talk but with practical action. Therefore, the Shanghai National Goods Factory Joint Association elected him as an executive committee member. In every meeting, his insightful opinions always hit the mark, winning the respect and admiration of everyone, who honored him as a practitioner of promoting national goods. After the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, Mr. Xiang was filled with righteous indignation and planned strategies to resist the invaders. He organized a volunteer army within the factory, training them day and night, and joined the boycott of enemy goods organizations, actively working. During the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the Five Continents' second branch on Kaozha Road was searched by the enemy, and eleven employees, including Jiang Bangyu, Yu Gengfeng, Tong Yongcai, Qi Dejiang, Ding Zhaonian, Xu Zhijie, Chen Hankun, Wu Chenliang, Li Shengcai, Zhou Ruilong, and Tao Fu, were arrested, their fates unknown. Upon hearing the news, Mr. Xiang personally went to rescue them. His colleagues tried to dissuade him, but Mr. Xiang said, "As the company manager, this concerns the lives of eleven people. How can I not enter the tiger's den to save them?" He then ventured forth at great risk. He returned safely the first time, but was arrested on his second attempt. Seeing his business card, the enemy escorted him to the headquarters of the Marine Corps, questioning him about the reasons for organizing the volunteer army and boycotting Japanese goods. It turned out that the enemy had long been wary of him and taken note of him. Mr. Xiang spoke frankly, stating that the enemy should not disregard international conventions by forcibly occupying our land and massacring our compatriots. The enemy, angered by his unyielding stance, harmed him. This happened on January 31st, 1932. Unyielding in the face of force, he died a martyr, bringing glory to the nation. Though dead, he lived on. Therefore, the factory colleagues all engraved the three characters "131" on their badges to commemorate their grief. Recently, the factory planned to publish a special issue titled "In Memory of Mr. Xiang Songmao," inviting Supervisory Committee member Gao Youtang to write Mr. Xiang's biography. The manuscript has already been completed and contains phrases such as, "If Songmao had been wise and protected himself, not resisted Japan or rejected Japanese goods, he could have lived; not rescued people or taken risks, he could have lived; if he had knelt and begged for mercy from the Japanese invaders, willing to submit and be humiliated, he could have lived. But Songmao ultimately died for resisting Japan, rejecting Japanese goods, rescuing people, taking risks, and refusing to submit or be humiliated. Sima Qian said, 'Death can be heavier than Mount Tai.' This is what he meant by Songmao. With Songmao's death, Songmao became immortal. How can Songmao be said to have died?" Such words are enough to inspire spirits and encourage those who follow. Therefore, this is specially highlighted to inform my comrades who are enthusiastic about promoting national goods and concerned about national affairs.</p>

<p>— Sai Yu</p>
<p>Time: Some afternoon.</p>
<p>Location: A very wide road, but not crowded with people.</p>
<p>Characters: A vendor shouting along the road, Father, Son.</p>
<p>Setting: The father is leading the son by the hand, approaching from a distance. There is a vendor over there, holding small toy cars in his hand, shouting loudly, hoping to attract some customers, but there are none.</p>
<p>Vendor: Toy cars, want toy cars? Six copper coins to ride to the Bund!</p>
<p>Son: (Stops and refuses to move forward.) Daddy... this toy car is very fun. Let's buy one too!</p>
<p>Father: (Asks the vendor) How much does one of these cars cost?</p>
<p>Vendor: Only six copper coins! Look, isn't it very small and cute? (Takes one out and shows it off to them.)</p>
<p>Father: (Takes the car, looking at it repeatedly from all angles. Suddenly shows a surprised expression.) This thing isn't a national product, is it? (To son) We shouldn't buy this thing. Let's go buy one made by Chinese people instead!</p>
<p>Vendor: (Smiling) Aren't foreign goods the same, sir?</p>
<p>Father: (Slightly angry) You! Why don't you sell things made by Chinese people, and insist on selling foreign goods?</p>
<p>Son: This thing is a foreign product? We don't want to buy it then. I always hear our teacher at school say... we Chinese people should buy Chinese goods.</p>
<p>Father: (With a sincere attitude towards the vendor) I advise you to give up selling this kind of goods and sell national goods instead!</p>
<p>Vendor: Sir! We just want to get some profit. What do we care about national goods or foreign goods?</p>
<p>Son: (Shows an impatient expression) Let's go! Don't talk to him anymore.</p>
<p>Father: (While stopping his son from going forward, speaks to the vendor very sincerely) Don't you always hope that your own family will prosper? That's because you are a member of the family, and after the family prospers, you can also benefit. The nation is like a big family, and you and I are all members of this big family. If the big family can become strong, then we, as members of the family, can also benefit. But to make our big family strong, we must first do the work of strengthening the nation. If you can promote national goods, that is one way to strengthen our big family. Do you understand this reason?</p>
<p>Vendor: Sir! What you said is certainly right, but I don't know if selling Chinese goods is easy or not?</p>
<p>Father: Of course, you use the same method as selling foreign goods. After you sell your current stock, you can then promote national goods, and I hope you persuade your colleagues as well. Then, you will have made a great effort for the big family. (To son) Let's go!</p>

<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Bright spring sunshine! Replacing the withered, harsh winter! The plums and apricots are blooming in competition, and the green grass is like a carpet. "Spring slumber unaware of the dawn, everywhere one hears the song of birds." What a lovely season this is!</p>
<p>Sanbao, a self-reliant woman, is wearing a spring dress of apple green color made by the Meiya Silk Factory! Her collar is tied with a silk embroidered handkerchief of national goods! Her feet are wearing white canvas rubber-soled shoes from the Chen Jiageng Company! She especially shows off her willow eyebrows, almond eyes, and graceful figure as a beautiful woman!</p>
<p>Her name, Sanbao (Three Treasures), is derived from her love for the three practical national goods. These three treasures were given to her by her lover, Mr. S.</p>
<p>Mr. S does not propose to Sanbao. He thinks; the passionate love between a man and woman should not be forced, it should be allowed to develop naturally! She sees the objects (the three national goods) and thinks of the person! Perhaps she will fall in love with me! She also feels that Mr. S is a likable person. She thinks he does not pursue the opposite sex with small favors, but is generous and loves the country, loves national goods, and loves the loved one! It is such bliss to be his life companion! How can she miss this opportunity?</p>
<p>Without seeking his consent, on this bright spring day, a large advertisement appeared in the newspaper, a marriage announcement of Sanbao and Mr. S. Relatives and friends were surprised and said, "The Year of National Goods, Bound by Red Thread!" This is a beautiful story about Sanbao!</p>

<h3 id="e240">Chinese Inventors Invent New Style Condensed Milk Machine <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>The West Lake Condensed Milk Company was founded by Xiao Jiagan. Diligently managed, it has been seven years since, and the business is becoming increasingly prosperous. The Yanchai brand condensed milk produced is in greater demand than supply. Recently, Mr. Xiao invented a milk powder machine, and the products are excellent. He has applied to the Ministry of Industry for a ten-year patent, named "Roller Vacuum Combined Type." In addition, there is also the invention of a condensed milk air compressor. This machine uses a certain gas to compress the air out of the condensed milk can, so that the color and taste of the condensed milk inside the can remain unchanged for a long time. This invention is the first of its kind in our country and has attracted the attention of all sectors of society. Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, chairman of the National Government's Construction Committee, also believes that it is a promising creative undertaking in our country and has joined the founders to show his approval. Shanghai banking circles such as the Bank of Communications and Zhejiang Industrial Bank have all agreed to provide strong support. It is said that the company believes that the import of dairy products in recent years has reached 20 million yuan, and milk powder is the most. Moreover, the tariffs are very heavy, with more than 48 yuan in national currency levied per morning kilogram, which is the best opportunity to recover profit rights. Therefore, the company has decided to expand ordinary shares to 120,000 yuan in addition to the full subscription, and plans to publicly add 80,000 yuan of preferred shares. According to Mr. Xiao, the company currently has more than 200 dairy cows and more than 2,000 acres of pasture. There is absolutely no problem with expanding the pasture, and there is also great confidence in the manufacturing side. The company can manufacture all dairy products from various countries, and the machines manufactured are all designed by Mr. Xiao. It is said that the total cost of all machines will be less than 40,000 yuan. If they are custom-made from abroad, it will cost at least tens of thousands of yuan, and the mechanical capacity may be higher than that of foreign goods. Among them, a single-effect vacuum machine can reach a vacuum degree of more than 30 degrees, which has broken the world vacuum record. For the sake of advanced study, Mr. Xiao is now exploring the principle of high altitude. If he can get what he wants, the world's vacuum meter will not be limited to 30 degrees in the future, and there will be a high-altitude vacuum meter to replace it.</p>

<p>— Yiyi Guanzhu</p>
<p>As the proverb says, "If you want a family to be discordant, unless you take a concubine." This is a golden rule to advise men not to take concubines. All women, after hearing this golden rule, will naturally listen to it with 120% attention. Because if a husband takes a concubine, the wife is in danger of being abandoned! Therefore, all women, after hearing this golden rule to advise men not to take concubines丨"If you want a family to be discordant, unless you take a concubine"丨how can they not listen? So, this year is the "Year of Women's National Goods," and now I might as well change this golden rule that women listen to丨"If you want a family to be discordant, unless you take a concubine"丨to "If you want the country not to perish, you must love national goods," to advise women. I don't know if women will listen to it in the same way as the golden rule "If you want a family to be discordant, unless you take a concubine"?</p>
<p>I think, as long as they are citizens of the Republic of China, regardless of gender, after hearing this sentence "If you want the country not to perish, you must love national goods," there is no one who will not listen, right?</p>
<p>Alas? The situation is urgent! The country is in danger! If you want the country not to perish, you must love national goods!</p>
<h3 id="e242">On Domestic Tonics <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Among the valuable domestic tonics, the first is Jilin ginseng, and the second is Sichuan white fungus. However, truly wild ginseng is very rare, and most of it is produced by artificial cultivation. It is extremely difficult to distinguish between the superior and the inferior. Speaking of its efficacy, it only refreshes the mind and invigorates qi, which is what Western medicine calls containing excitatory substances. A previous report stated that a certain Mr. Zhang in Zhabei, Shanghai, bought and ate 20 yuan of ginseng, which resulted in his sudden death. Western medicine diagnosed that it was caused by excessive excitement from eating ginseng. This is like adding fuel to the fire, increasing its flames. Moreover, the ultimate element of any part of the human body that ginseng possesses has not been scientifically verified in this era of scientific advancement. In the end, it is difficult for everyone to take it with peace of mind. Now that the producing area of ginseng has fallen to a strong neighbor, I am even more unwilling to eat it to provide funds for the enemy. Therefore, most Chinese people have changed to eating Sichuan white fungus. Because the Sichuan white fungus has been sold exclusively by the Sichuan store in the local Paoqiu field for many years. The number of eaters is increasing day by day, the sales are booming, and the efficacy is also greatly enhanced. Such as male and female yin deficiency, physical weakness, blood deficiency, lung disease, hemorrhoids, women's irregular menstruation, children's physical weakness, buying and eating the store's white fungus have significant effects. The owner of the store believes that Sichuan white fungus has such great efficacy and has occupied the primary position of domestic tonics. And in view of the customs records of the import of foreign medicines every year, there are tens of millions of dollars, most of which are proprietary medicines and tonics that do not meet the constitution of the Chinese people. Both the leak of national wealth is alarming and the obstruction of health is difficult. Sichuan white fungus has been trusted by the Chinese people. Without scientific chemical verification, it is important to deeply understand what tonic elements it contains, so that the Chinese people have a deeper understanding of Sichuan white fungus. Everyone should work hard to promote it in order to reduce the invasion of imported tonics. In 1931, a huge amount of Sichuan white fungus was requested by Hu Zejun of the Chinese Science Society for precise scientific chemical verification. As a result, Sichuan white fungus, in addition to containing potassium, iron, sulfur, sodium, fat, protein, and other elements, produced a large amount of mucilage similar to gum arabic in the water-boiled solution. In summary, the various tonic elements contained have the following major functions. 1. Replenish blood. 2. Help digestion. 3. Benefit bowel movements. With the Sichuan white fungus alone, it has three major effects, which is truly unmatched by any tonic. Although Sichuan stores are in the midst of a depression in the Shanghai market, the store's business has grown year by year. The breadth of its sales can also be seen.</p>

<h3 id="e243">The Characteristics of the Chinese People <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Ana</p>
<p>Social practices like bowing, hand-cupping salutations, and kowtowing are not habits that should exist in modern times, but rather remnants of the "prosperous past." Northerners are more servile than Southerners because they are closer to the imperial capital and have been subject to traditional oppression... The Manchus were adept at hand-cupping salutations, and the "Beijing style" officialdom was very strong, which is an example.</p>
<p>The blame for this should be placed squarely on Shusun Tong. He lacked ambition and was unable to express himself, so he created elaborate "court rituals" to please Emperor Gaozu of Han, making him the epitome of a lackey. In this 20th-century era of freedom and equality, lackeys should repent and reform. In America, the arrogance of the president or high officials is far less than that of a small magistrate or "master" in our country. This is simply because they are civilized and democratic, while we are not. They are getting things done, while we are causing trouble...</p>
<p>However, the human spirit has always been free. No matter how much it is subjected to the education of lackeys, its nature still desires freedom. Many petty officials are consumed by their desires, wanting to become high officials, precisely because they are still oppressed when they are petty officials, and can be more free when they are high officials. No one has ever been willing to be oppressed, or felt comfortable being used as a brick embedded in a wall. But since they are bricks, they cannot escape the confines of the wall, so they only want to oppress their colleagues, wanting to be the brick on top, with all the weight below them and no higher oppression, in other words, being more free.</p>
<p>With the change in the economic system, the situation is different. Having money means being more free. This is the development of commercial society. No matter how much one is looked down upon, scolded, or oppressed, becoming a tycoon can transform one into an "important person" or "celebrity." At that time, one will not be oppressed, can retaliate against oppressors, and can manipulate many things, like an emperor. So people bow their heads and lower their eyes, letting others laugh and scold, whether for officials or merchants, all aiming to make money, as if they have grasped the main vein, becoming gold miners.</p>
<p>People in the "thirty-six trades" and "seventy-two trades" of society are simply educating themselves, educating their children, and educating others in this way. Some say that three ordinary Europeans are not as good as one Jew, and three Jews are not as good as one Chinese person. There is truth to this saying. China is traditionally oppressed, acting as a lackey while also wanting to be the master, all struggling in bitterness! Striving to be hardworking, ruthless, and stingy towards oneself! Also ruthless, stingy, and cruel towards others.</p>

<p>— Peng Xuezhen</p>
<p>I just came back from seeing off a friend at the station. Walking down Pingmen Bridge, my umbrella touched someone else's umbrella. I looked up:</p>
<p>Under that tattered oiled paper umbrella, the mother and daughter, Little Beizi, were both speaking in a sharp voice...</p>
<p>"Oh!" Both of their arrowhead-colored faces wore bitter smiles.</p>
<p>Without them saying anything, I suddenly remembered that Little Beizi was going to Shanghai today. She had told me this last night while drawing well water. This girl had a winter vacation, and every night she went to my place to learn a few characters. Her deep and dark eyes revealed her intelligence. Now she can write the songs she usually recites on paper.</p>
<p>Yesterday Little Beizi told me she was going to Shanghai, and I thought she was joking. At this moment, I unconsciously turned around and walked towards the station with them again.</p>
<p>"It is a proper place to eat, after all. Little Beizi's godmother introduced her. She said that her voice is clear and soft, and she's very good at learning to sing Qing opera, 呃, she's just singing songs, and doesn't..." Her mother breathed a sigh of relief. "There's nothing else she can do, her father owes money, and doesn't even have money to buy silkworm eggs."</p>
<p>"She's still young, isn't she, fifteen?" "Sixteen, a flower-like age! Getting a little money to make ends meet."</p>
<p>The woman said it quite frankly, but the tightly locked brow told people that her heart, like that tattered oiled paper umbrella, had countless holes.</p>
<p>Little Beizi remained silent throughout, as if she were enduring and choking back the bitter water of life. I thought of her quick wit and clear singing voice across the river on summer nights.</p>
<p>For this little bit of talent, Little Beizi found "a way out."</p>
<p>On the platform, the bell rang rapidly three times. Little Beizi stepped silently onto the train, tears welling up in the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>"Go well, your godmother will pick you up at the Shanghai station."</p>
<p>The engine spewed ink-dragon-like smoke, and the tracks rumbled.</p>
<p>Little Beizi's mother sobbed as she walked out of the tunnel with me.</p>
<p>The light rain continued to fall relentlessly. We held up our umbrellas and walked silently on the stone path, carrying the same heavy heart.</p>
<p>I secretly estimated... Little Beizi washing her face clean, applying a little rouge, and putting on a simple cheongsam, would be a pitifully attractive courtesan!</p>

<p>The Wenlan Bridge is a white stone bridge with iron railings in my hometown. It crosses the small river that surrounds the east of the village.</p>
<p>On this side of the village is the coal bunker and pond at the bottom of the Zhongxinheng Silk Factory. On the opposite bank are two rows of mulberry trees lining the road as far as the eye can see, and beyond that are vegetable fields and fish ponds. In the summer, that is where the farmers rest after dinner. Many people gather on this bridge, each talking about their daytime activities and simple feelings. Men lean against the railings, and women, pestered by children, sit on the stone steps holding their water pipes.</p>

<p>丨Random Notes from a Windowless Room, Number Four</p>
<p>"Each generation is worse than the last"! This sentence has become a deterministic view of China's future in the eyes of most people. In fact, it is a vicious sarcastic remark. From a positive perspective, we should say, "Each generation is better than the last."</p>
<p>"Each generation is worse than the last" is a pessimistic view. If we calmly look forward, we can clearly see the reverse of this statement in both major and minor matters丨"Each generation is better than the last."</p>
<p>People of the previous generation have had their minds shaped by the past era, and no amount of whipping can move them forward. Hoping that they will get better is like hoping for a dying person. It's impossible. Who has the power to turn back the past? This era ultimately belongs to the future, and the people in this era are ultimately different from the previous generation. I once asked a young nun for her opinion on ghosts and gods. She said, "What ghosts and gods? I only have food to eat because I chant scriptures. I say there are ghosts and gods with my mouth." This answer is very frank. She approves of a married monk, saying that it is right. Judging from these words, she will definitely liberate herself if she has the opportunity.</p>
<p>If you give elementary and middle school students the topic "Your future aspirations," they will definitely say that they want to be revolutionaries, overthrow imperialism, overthrow warlords, overthrow..., and create a world of great harmony. There is no falsehood in this statement, because elementary school students don't know how to be false. I once saw an essay by a student from a railway primary school on this topic. He said that he wanted to be a section chief in the future. This shows that the young heart is always pure and white.</p>
<p>Some people have regarded "kill all those over thirty" as a terrifying slogan. Yes, this statement is a bit too extreme. However, expecting the people of the previous generation to make the world a better place is truly foolish and delusional! Putting hope in the hands of the next generation will definitely yield results, although the size of the fruit cannot be predicted.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Random Thoughts on a Trip to Hangzhou <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Having traveled to Hangzhou, I wanted to write a travelogue, but I felt there was nothing to write about; Hangzhou didn't give me any good material. However, I can't blame Hangzhou; I should blame myself... Traveling to Hangzhou shouldn't start from Shanghai in the first place.</p>
<p>If I had started from a remote countryside, arriving in Hangzhou would definitely be quite a sight. However, people departing from Shanghai always carry Shanghai in their hearts, and Hangzhou is striving to become Shanghai. This gives Shanghai tourists a sense of "having seen the great ocean" and "having seen the Wushan mountains," making Hangzhou seem "hard to be water" and "not like clouds."</p>
<p>Take the rickshaw, for example. Shanghai rickshaw pullers can navigate even the most crowded streets with ease and composure. If there's an obstacle, they simply shout "Hey!" as a warning. In Hangzhou, however, even on streets with few pedestrians, the rickshaw pullers are constantly shouting "Hey, keep to the side! Keep to the side!" and some other words I don't understand, appearing very flustered and rushed. Also, the entrances of Hangzhou hotels are often filled with rickshaws and pullers, making it almost impossible for others to pass, but the people of Hangzhou seem indifferent, and those who come to Hangzhou can do nothing about it. I believe that the nature of the city of Hangzhou is partly reflected in the rickshaws... It lacks order, but it doesn't really need much strict order. Because life in Hangzhou is not very tense in the first place; it's usually leisurely. On normal days, the pullers shouting "Keep to the side!" or something else is actually an expression of leisure.</p>
<p>Because they are used to leisure, Hangzhou inevitably becomes flustered and unable to maintain order when it comes to special, tense times. During the few days I was in Hangzhou, it was precisely such a tense time for the city. One reason was the pilgrimage season, when pious men and women came to pay their respects; the second was the spring break, when school teachers and students came for sightseeing; and the third was the period when the Zhejiang Province Boy Scouts were gathering in the provincial capital for a review.</p>
<p>The people of Hangzhou were flustered and rushed, but very happy, because this was an opportunity to make money. This year's business all depended on these few days. So, needless to say, hotel prices went up, restaurant prices went up, boat prices went up, rickshaw prices went up... everything went up. And the way they went up was truly frightening.</p>
<p>One evening, I was eating in a restaurant and saw a customer three or four tables away ordering sweet and sour fish, which is a famous Hangzhou dish. When the sweet and sour fish was ready, a waiter took it to another waiter, telling him to pass it to the customer, and at the same time instructed:</p>
<p>"Five jiao eight or six jiao four, you can calculate it yourself."</p>
<p>Because they were speaking right next to me, I heard it very clearly and was a little surprised.</p>
<p>That day happened to be Qingming Festival, probably the busiest day in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Two days later, the hustle and bustle had subsided a bit, and I also wanted to eat sweet and sour fish. So I went to the same restaurant and first asked the waiter about the price, which he said was four jiao eight.</p>
<p>When it arrived, the quality was the same as the "five jiao eight" or "six jiao four" from that day. I couldn't help but wonder if the customer that day had paid "five jiao eight" or "six jiao four"?</p>
<p>Things like this made the prices in Hangzhou at that time absurdly astonishing.</p>
<p>At that time, I had not yet reached the age of understanding things like adults, and I didn't quite understand their conversations. However, those talkative people often appeared in my memory, especially Wu Daniu, who was taller and more straightforward than anyone else.</p>
<p>He was a man of about thirty who didn't talk much but was willing to work. He had a nature that wouldn't yield even if a knife was swung at him—a nature often found in kind farmers. Standing next to him was like standing next to a solid, proudly upright cypress tree. He worked as a long-term laborer at the home of one of our wealthy uncles—Uncle Yonglu. In the morning, he carried basket after basket of mulberry leaves picked by the female workers to the market; he moved the "silkworm beds" among the adult women and thirteen- or fourteen-year-old children who were busy selecting mature silkworms. In addition, he had to irrigate the mulberry fields in the morning and evening and help with Uncle Yonglu's trivial household chores. "Well, this is how my hired hand should be. Be diligent, Daniu!" When silkworm farming was at its busiest, Uncle Yonglu would often say encouragingly to Daniu. In order to advocate using cheap prices to buy unexpected labor, he loved to say to people in a greedy tone... "Actually, everyone in the world should become as obedient and hardworking as oxen. As long as a few people take the lead. Look, if there are too many smart people, won't the world get worse and worse?"</p>
<p>The strong man was not tempted by the landlord's praise. He seemed to work only for fate, but sometimes when it exceeded his endurance, he would use more gloomy and clumsy movements to express his doubts; this aroused contempt and anger in the landlord. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e251">Half a Day's Lesson (9) <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>The weather in early autumn is like intentionally playing jokes on people. In the morning, it spreads a light chill, but by noon, it can even bring out sunlight that is more unbearable than summer. The climate changes greatly within a single day. There is no wind, only the evaporation of heat. After three hours, I saw almost everyone's face dripping with sweat, but they, like me, forgot to wipe it with a handkerchief. Their entire mind and spirit seemed to be occupied by the depression inside.</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone on the stage started shouting:</p>
<p>"Long live the Great Japanese Empire!"</p>
<p>"Long live the Great Manchurian Empire!"</p>
<p>The crowd below followed, shouting in a chaotic noise like a big quarrel. Then, people were made to get on cars under the protection of police and soldiers and drove away.</p>
<p>A parade began. The route was to leave the sports field, walk along Shangyi Street, then Liangmihang Street, to the Governor's Office, then back to Liangmihang Street, Xinkaimen Street, out of Xinkaimen, along the main road to Laoti Fasi, turn into Chalu Kou Chaoyang Street, enter Dadongmen Henan Street, and return to the sports field to disband. The order of the parade was: military police in front, followed by Japanese elementary schools, Tongwen Commercial School, First Normal School, First Middle School, Girls' Middle School, Girls' Normal School, First Middle School, County Middle School, Midwifery School, Municipal Elementary School, County Elementary School. The sea of people surged, police whistles blew, people shouted and screamed, running around in chaos. A huge commotion broke out throughout the entire sports field.</p>
<p>It seemed I heard that this was a citizens' celebration, but apart from the students, not a single small citizen could be found in the procession. A large flag was being carried in front, a military band was playing music, and the crowd moved slowly. We were just playing the role of clowns in a drama.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Governor's Office, it turned out we were to shout "Long live" to Xi Qia three times! Facing the clear and mirror-like Songhua River beside me, and then thinking of the steep mountains and high peaks of Jiangnan, I thought to myself, how could the beautiful mountains and clear waters of Jilin, such a good land in Northeast China, be permanently occupied by Japanese imperialism! How could our thirty million people quietly be doing as slaves of a conquered nation, allowing our children and grandchildren to never be able to turn over! Oh, I cannot believe it!</p>
<p>In the clear sky, there were a few thin white clouds. The river breeze drifted by, warm and gentle. Who wouldn't say it was a good autumn day! However, on this day a year ago, and on the days after two years ago, wasn't a hideous farce and a cruel massacre being staged in Northeast China?</p>
<p>Turning back onto Liangmihang Street, I saw the brand-new signboard of "Xiehe Bookstore." (This was formerly the Zhonghua Bookstore, renamed by order of the Department of Education.) I thought to myself that in a few years, we probably wouldn't even be able to see the characters "Zhonghua."</p>
<p>The people in the procession gradually decreased. When I noticed some students secretly slipping out of the procession, I, who was already tired and reluctant to move my feet, also found an opportunity to slip to the outside of the procession and hide in a small alley on the side of the street.</p>
<p>It was already twelve o'clock.</p>
<p>"Half a day's lesson is considered done."</p>
<p>Thinking this, I slowly walked on the road home...</p>
<p>"When will we not have to take such lessons? When will we be able to regain our freedom?..." (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e252">Despite Rising Financial Silver Prices, the Standard Gold Market Remains Steady, with a Slight Drop of Three Jiao After an Initial Increase <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>The gold market was quite stable yesterday. Swap rates were nearing parity, and sentiment was relatively good. However, telegrams regarding the silver case were profit-driven, making it difficult for prices to rise sharply. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw both the U.S. and British markets rise in unison. The five-metal exchange saw forward silver prices increase by five hao to one and a half li, but the January contracts remained unchanged. Exchange rates narrowed, U.S. cotton rose by ten pounds, U.S. wheat rose by three and seven-five, and London spot gold rose by three pence, indicating a better overall environment. As a result, although the opening price of the gross market fell, it did not break the 50 yuan mark. Gan Changxiang Heng Yufu Xingyong competed to purchase, causing the price to rebound to above three yuan and a half. A Reuters report stated that the U.S. Senate subcommittee reported yesterday that the Agricultural Committee was scheduled to meet today to consider the Sires Silver Act and formally report to the Senate, with a vote possible within the week without delay. The report also mentioned the amendments by Weller and Thomas (three items omitted), causing prices to drop. However, Hui Xiang continued to advance and partially recovered. Later, Reuters reported again that the Sires Silver Act had a favorable situation within the Agricultural Committee, and that the Thomas Amendment, which would nationalize silver, was also gaining traction. This caused sentiment to turn cautious, and prices fell again after the opening. The Central Bank opened with over two hundred bars, and major players also bought heavily, stabilizing the market and causing it to hover around two yuan with little change. The price of red gold was estimated at 965 yuan. Because the swap premium for refined gold was feared to be high, many sellers emerged (those holding spot goods hedged with futures). The Central Bank's opening price also tended to be weak. The three-way swap, coinciding with the week, started early at 10 a.m. on Saturday. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 952 yuan and eight jiao, up three jiao compared to the previous close. Physical goods opened at the same price. The opening exchange rates for recent sales were one shilling four pence two five for British exchange and 34 yuan nine three seven five for U.S. exchange. Richang Yida Yong sold off some, causing the price to retreat from three yuan one jiao (this price was difficult to sell) to two yuan two jiao. Mai Jiali Huabi ate August U.S. dollars at 35 yuan and a half, and Yuanchun advanced with some bars, bringing the price to two yuan eight jiao. However, Yida Yong continued to sell, while Zhengchang Xie and Yongda Fenheng and others supplied. Citibank offered May U.S. dollars at one two five, causing the price to fall to one yuan two jiao. The Central Bank opened for spot, stabilizing the situation. HSBC posted its exchange rates, with both British and U.S. rates unchanged. Later, the bank bid for August U.S. dollars at five six two five, and Yida Yong Xie Kang Gan Changxiang took some bars, pushing the price back up to two yuan four jiao. Retail investors pressed the price aggressively, and the supply also surged. The bank pushed for distant contracts and closed nearby positions, leveling the positions, and the price once retreated to one yuan and a half, but the situation remained buoyant. Later, major players such as Yuanchun Yuanmao Yongheng Xing and others took advantage of the low prices to enter, while Shengda Wanxing sold off, causing the price to struggle around two yuan for quite some time. Hengxing Yuqing Yong Zhifengyong took positions more eagerly, pushing the price back up to two yuan six jiao. Mitsui offered July U.S. dollars at three seven five, and Zhifengyong and others sold, keeping the market stable. After hovering, the noon close was 952 yuan and two jiao. Physical goods were traded at one yuan nine jiao. After the close, Yongfeng supplied some bars, causing a slight drop. It was observed that the highest price for the half day was 953 yuan one jiao, and the lowest price was 951 yuan two jiao, a difference of one yuan and nine jiao, slightly down by three jiao compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on HSBC's U.S. dollar exchange rate remaining unchanged at 34 yuan and a half, resulting in a standard gold price of just under 1,003 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was estimated that the pressure was around 51 yuan, not much different from the previous close. The book value for this month was 953 yuan, and for May it was 952 yuan. The water rate in the morning was 953 yuan. The price of red gold was estimated at 965 yuan. Swap rates were nearing parity, and refined gold was weaker. Supply in the market was greater than demand, as those holding spot goods were bound to hedge with standard gold, necessitating a swap premium. The Tianjin gang sold over a thousand taels to Dafengheng, only adding 12 yuan and a half. Yingfenghang sold 993 fineness to the silverware gang, adding 13 to 14 yuan. In addition, East goods were priced around 10 yuan, with little transaction activity. The Central Bank's spot opening was sluggish, with the price almost at par with standard gold, also due to swap rates. The industry was very willing to supply. It was estimated that over 200 bars were handled by Tongfeng Yong Yingfenghang Taikang Run and others, priced at 952 yuan. As of today, there were still 196 bars remaining in this month's contracts, with three bullish houses in total: Yingfenghang Lihengxing. There were two bearish houses: Fuchang Dafengheng.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was still average. In summary, Yida Yong Tongchun Yifeng Yong Sida Ruikang Yuanmao Yongda Decheng Fuchang Huiyuan Hengyu Yicheng Yongfeng Xie Xingyong and others were sellers. Fuxingyong Gan Changxiang Heng Taicheng Kang Yongda Changxiang Hengxing Yuan Hongkang Yong Tongfeng Heng Futai Heng Yongde Bingxing Fuyu Yuanchun Yingmao Heng and others were buyers. Huixiang Xiexing Yong Zhifeng Yong were advanced and then retreated. Hengxing Dafa Yong Yuqing Yong retreated and then advanced. The Dalian gang Wanxing traded over 800 bars, with a slight net sale. Shunli traded over 600 bars, with a negligible net sale. The Guang gang Shengda traded about 200 bars each, Hengxing advanced 200 bars and sold 300 bars. As of today, the total number of May contracts was 24,052.</p>
<p>The lineup for May was as follows: Bullish houses included Shunli with over 2,600 bars, Yuanyi with over 2,300, Wanxing with over 2,000, Qingfa Yong with over 1,400, Hengyu with slightly less than 1,400, Zhifeng Yong and Yifeng Yong with over 1,200 each, Gan Changxiang with over 1,700, Dachanxiang with over 1,100, Run Changyu with over 900, Run Changyong with over 600, and Yingfenghang Shengda Xianghe Dingkang with over 500 each. Bearish houses included Hengxing with over 2,000, Yida Yong with over 1,700, Yuqing Yong Zhengchang with over 1,600 each, Yuanmao Yong with over 1,500, Huiyuan with over 1,300, Sida with slightly less than 1,300, Bingxing with over 800, Ruixing Yuanchang Yong with over 700 each, Tianfeng Yuanchun Dacheng with over 600 each, and Hengtai with over 500. There were 44 bullish houses and 56 bearish houses in total.</p>
<h3 id="e253">The Cable Rose, and British Exchange Rates Eased Slightly <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign telegrams, the London cable rate rose by three one two five for both near and distant contracts. U.S. banks increased by two five, forward silver prices rose by five hao, the British pound against the U.S. dollar narrowed by one cent, the U.S. dollar against the British pound fell by one and two five, the British pound against the French franc rose slightly by twelve pounds, the U.S. dollar against the French franc rose by two five, London spot gold rose by three pence, and private telegrams reported a soft silver price increase of zero six two five. Exchange rates fell by one and a half cents and were unstable. The opening exchange rates for recent sales in the morning were one shilling four pence two five for British exchange and 34 yuan nine three seven five for U.S. exchange. Compared to the previous close, the British pound eased by zero six two five, while the U.S. dollar was unchanged. Although the bank bid after the opening, the market sentiment was weak and the news was slightly negative. The bank offered near-term contracts and eased the rates. HSBC's posted rates were unchanged, and the Central Bank opened for spot and stabilized the rates. Later, the bank did swaps, but the process was mediocre and lacked variation. Extending to the noon close, the selling rates for recent contracts were one shilling four pence two five for British exchange and 34 yuan nine three one five for U.S. exchange. Compared to the previous close, the British pound eased by zero six two five and the U.S. dollar dropped . A Chinese merchant sold approximately 200,000 yuan in U.S. dollars, and Sassoon supplied shillings. The transactions for the first half of the day are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The opening selling rate for near-term British exchange in the morning was one shilling four pence two one. Dongli Huabi May was three one two five, and the Central Bank took the same month at the same price. Zhengjin also bid for the same month at the same price.

<h3 id="e256">The Bond Market Amid the Struggle Between Bulls and Bears <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Retail Short Covering Gradually Pushes Prices Higher, with the Situation Hovering and Changes Still Possible</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange hovered and gradually stabilized. After Monday's sharp drop and Tuesday's recovery, market sentiment became uncertain again. There were still many issues on the political front, but they were still in the brewing stage. There were also questions about whether Mr. Huang Fu would be satisfied with returning to the North. The extremely large volume of sales by No. 11 on Monday raised concerns about their ability to deliver the goods. No. 75 significantly increased its purchases to cover shorts, and No. 14 and No. 20 also showed strong buying interest. As a result, market prices slowly rose, but the trend seemed weak and lifeless. Moreover, two-thirds of Monday's sharp decline had already been recovered. If prices continued to rise, bulls would inevitably release a large number of holdings. Throughout yesterday, No. 46 released a large number of bull positions, and No. 75 also covered shorts aggressively. This was the most active buying and selling. Relatively speaking, there was more retail short covering, and market prices gradually rose. The first session in the morning immediately rose by two jiao to half a yuan or so. Bidding in the second session was quite intense. Although market prices fluctuated slightly, the highs and lows were only one or two jiao apart. After the afternoon opening, there were more retail buyers than sellers, and the market price remained strong, rising another two or three jiao. The closing was flat. The market situation was such that the bulls wanted to push prices up and the bears wanted to suppress them, resulting in a considerable struggle. There were still many potential changes, and the situation should still be guided by the times. Market prices mainly rose by two to six jiao, with a rise of nine jiao in military bonds being the largest. The total transaction volume was 17,334,000 yuan, significantly lower than Monday's 31 million and Tuesday's 23 million. A comparison table of the highs, lows, and increases/decreases is shown below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>According to a report from the Sin Feng Foreign Firm based on the Wall Street Journal yesterday, the market was active and trending higher. The largest gains were around two dollars, driven by positive commercial reports, including those from US Steel and Bethlehem Steel. The strike by auto mechanics had also been resolved. However, the market showed signs of fatigue at closing, although the decline was not significant. The minor exchange saw slightly higher activity. Speculative bonds surged due to favorable commercial news. US Treasury bonds saw minimal fluctuation. Foreign bonds, particularly German and Argentinian 6% bonds, were the weakest. Furthermore, a report from our agent stated that the positive commercial news and the resolution of the auto industry strike seemed likely to continue the upward trend. There was increased participation in the (US wheat) market, with a total volume of 491,000,000 bushels, and a slightly bullish sentiment. According to reports (US cotton), both the House and Senate agreed to the original form of the朋克海案. Also, according to Washington news, the Senate committee approved the戴斯 silver proposal, along with the湯麥士 and 衛勒 plan to purchase one hundred million ounces of silver. This led to a firm and bullish market with a surge in activity. (Rubber) The market was firm, with strong buying interest. March consumption is projected to be around 46,000 tons. (Sugar) The market was slightly soft, with pressure on spot prices.</p>
<p>Long positions were liquidated, and the technical position improved rapidly. The total trading volume for the day was 1.41 million shares. The Dow Jones Indices are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e258">Yarn and Cotton Price Decline Intensifies <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>#### New Low Price of $165.30 Per Person</p>
<p>The yarn and cloth market is weak, and the price decline is intensifying. The price of yarn for this month is the worst, with new lows discovered in each lot. However, the mills are not taking any action, reflecting the seriousness of the market situation. Consequently, there are even more sellers. The amount of yarn from various mills in warehouses is increasing, leading to extreme pressure. The future of the cotton industry appears bleak.</p>
<p>Price Lows Continue to be Discovered in Yarn Auctions</p>
<p>The pre-market opening price of yarn auctions, although American and Indian cotton prices rose, lacked significant buyers on the floor.</p>
<p>The market fell, with declines of 4, 5, 6, and 7 dimes for various months. In the afternoon, there were reports of sluggish yarn trading and strong selling pressure, with a near-term decline of $1.30 and a distant decline of 6 or 7 dimes. The total trading volume for the day was 38,400 bales. The sales included 1,000 bales from Yu Da, 2,300 bales from Tong Xing, 1,000 bales from Yi Yu, 1,000 bales from Hui Kang, 800 bales from Chun Ji, 800 bales from Jin Chang, and 650 bales from Yuan De. Purchases included 1,050 bales from Ming De, 2,600 bales from Yuan Da, 800 bales from Shun Da, and 900 bales from Chong An. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Auction Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Inventory</p>
<p>April 167.1 165.3 165.3 Down 1.70 42,150</p>

<p>Total 187,500</p>
<p>Spot Sales of 657 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. A total of 657 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day. 20-count yarn fell by 5 dimes, while 10-count yarn remained flat. The purchase amounts by various groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Inland: 62 for Shantou, 10 for Ningbo, 20 for Northern Groups, 465 for Guangdong, 100</p>
<h3 id="e259">April Cotton Reaches New Low Price <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market remains weak, although Indian and American cotton prices are trending higher. The local market has not been significantly affected due to poor yarn sales and mill shutdowns. Consequently, spot cotton trading is sluggish, and there is an increasing shortage of 16-count and 20-count raw cotton. Holders are rushing to hedge sell standards, resulting in a new low for April.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Continues to Decline</p>
<p>The pre-market opening price of cotton auctions rose following foreign cotton prices, but fell after two or three lots due to the decline in yarn prices and a lack of buyers, dropping 5 to 15 cents per month. The market sentiment remained weak in the afternoon, with each month falling another 10 to 15 cents. The total trading volume for the day was 79,600 piculs. Sales included 4,400 piculs from Dafu, 2,300 piculs from Yukang, 1,100 piculs from Changyu, 2,400 piculs from Yuande, 3,200 piculs from Dachangcheng, 9,400 piculs from Changfeng, and 3,200 piculs from Suilong. Purchases included 4,600 piculs from Dafeng, 5,400 piculs from Yuanda, 1,300 piculs from Gengfeng, 1,500 piculs from Dafu, 1,900 piculs from Yinda, 4,500 piculs from Xincheng, 1,600 piculs from Taichang, 1,400 piculs from Jifeng, and 1,300 piculs from Tongfu. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Auction Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change from Previous Day Inventory</p>
<p>April Future 41.00 40.75 40.75 Down 0.50 121,600</p>

<p>August Future 34.00 33.75 33.75 0.25 79,800</p>
<p>Total 656,000</p>
<p>Mills Halt High-Priced Raw Cotton Purchases</p>
<p>The need for spot cotton has dried up. Mills are stopping the procurement of high-priced raw cotton due to frequent declines in yarn prices, resulting in no transactions. The sources include 300 bales of Yao cotton and 300 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's yarn auction price change table, the word "Up" was missing from May onwards. Also, in the cotton auction price change table, the word "Up" was mistakenly printed as "Down" for all months. This is now corrected.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was firm and active due to positive news from Liverpool. Spot prices rose by ten points, and futures prices rose by 10 to 15 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by one point, while futures prices rose by five or six points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by three points. The孟贊 cotton market rose due to speculative buying.

<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a rise of 1 to 2.5 角 in foreign wheat quotations. However, the real transactions were not active. People were not optimistic just because foreign wheat prices rose. Only the distant months were affected by the rainy weather, and a few customers and shorts covered their positions, leading to a positive turn. At the opening of the morning session, near-term deliveries were briefly positive, with the current month rising to over $2.10. However, this was later offset by long positions closing and mills hedging, leading to a slight decline. Distant deliveries saw new buying and short covering. The closing price for the current month was slightly down by 0.5 分, next month down by 0.25, June up by 0.75, July up by 1.25 分, August up by 0.25, and September up by 0.05.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Quiet Trade in Both Near and Distant Wheat <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw quiet trading in both near and distant deliveries, with limited transactions. There were few near-term chips available, and the recent spot market has been active. Merchants are seeking to sell spot wheat in the market rather than hedging. After the morning opening, distant deliveries rose due to bullish sentiment driven by rainy weather, and sellers were unwilling to sell, with June, July, and August each rising by 1 分. However, longs closed out in July and August in the afternoon, and the closing prices remained the same as the previous day. Factory demand for spot wheat weakened, with continued arrivals. The market opened with Liuhe wheat at $3.36, Nantong wheat at $3.40, Yaowan wheat at $3.51, and Xuzhou wheat at $3.55. Fuxin purchased 200 bags, and Huafeng purchased 600 bags. With few transactions, the market outlook is bearish.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, about 30 sources arrived (over 5,000 piculs). Due to continuous rain, very few merchants visited the market, resulting in limited transactions. The local market sold only around 200-300 bags. The usual Zhejiang rice was not opened for sale, while Jiangsu and Southern Port rice saw slight movement. Prices remained unchanged. 洋尖 rice also had limited interest, while 杜尖 rice was slightly more popular, but 洋尖 rice was not opened for sale, and its price fell by 0.05. 阴变元 rice also saw no activity. However, the local customers initially showed interest in late-season rice, but later, merchants from Nanyang, Fuzhou, and Xiamen flocked to the market and made purchases, slightly shifting the market shape. However, since the purchasing power was extremely low, there was no room for optimism. Northern merchants also purchased 4 or 5 boats, with the two groups buying a total of 2,400-2,500 bags. However, the prices remained generally flat, and continued weakness was expected. Qingjiao, Xilian, Fengjing, and Nanjiang rice prices were adjusted down by 4-5 分.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over 10 boats arrived downstream from the river. Due to rain, both sellers and buyers did not come to the market, resulting in a flat and weak market.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Reduced Transactions in Ke Xian Rice <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market saw strong interest from the Ke groups. However, due to yesterday's rain,</p>
<p>the number of visiting merchants was not large, and total transactions were suddenly quiet. However, since raw material prices were high in the producing areas, freight costs were unprofitable, so holders remained optimistic and did not seek to sell at low prices due to quiet trading. The Ke cargo consisted of only 952 bags of rough Ke Xian rice from the Min and Ou groups in 沙市. The local market took advantage of the weak Ke cargo market and opportunistically purchased 150 bags of old Wuxi Chen Xian rice,</p>
<p>100 bags each of early-season machine rice, and 50 bags of red machine rice. The prices were similar to the previous market. The full batch of machine Xian rice was not sold because the holder was unwilling to lower the price.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Soybean Prices Rise Sharply <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market rose strongly. The supply was not large, and sales were still active. The exchange rates also rose, stabilizing the market and pushing prices up by 0.04. Factories transacted over 1,000 bags of Xuzhou soybeans, priced from $2.60 to $2.55. 7 cars of Yingzhou beans were also sold, priced at $2.60 to $2.54. One car of Huaiyuan beans was sold for $2.58. Merchants from Fuzhou bought</p>
<p>one car of Zhengyangguan beans for $2.70, as well as over 300 bags of Xuzhou beans for $2.60, and 200 bags of Guide beans for $2.61. Merchants from the local street bought one car of Zhengyangguan beans for $2.67, as well as one car of Feihe beans, also for $2.67, and one car of Yingzhou beans for $2.60. 500 bags of Hankou Xinyangzhou beans were also sold for $2.65 to $2.44, which were purchased by three groups from the inland, Fuzhou, and Zhuzhou.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar cloth market was flat, and transactions remained 不盛. Brokers quoted $19.85 for 二四 crude sugar white general goods, and $6.70 for re-exported goods, up 0.03 from before. Eight and nine grade He 赤划 $15.75, and eight grade five 0.05. Only 28 bags of Taikoo sugar B were sold at $20.03, up 0.05. It is recorded that No. 1 本绵白 was $18.40, with no change.

<p>The sales of Hunan lotus seeds have been sluggish recently. Although the inventory in the market is not very large, the selling prices have actually declined. Yesterday, the prices for Hengzhou lotus seeds were $42, Jiuxi lotus seeds were $43, Raozhou lotus seeds were $41, and Changde lotus seeds were less than $40. After the price drop, only sporadic transactions occurred.</p>

<p>Judging from the market situation of green lead in previous years, there must be a prosperous scene at this time. Because new tea is on the market, the tea gangs must have huge business. The trading of yellow lead factories should also develop at this time. Nai Jin Geng market, 改常規, not only the tea gang business does not move, but also the yellow lead factory paint company printing 　 room and other transactions are also dull and undeveloped. Therefore, the stagnation of the market can be said to be the extreme point, but the market price is rising day by day. The reason for this is that lead merchants are releasing air from all sides, 脱 overseas spot goods are extremely scarce, and the arrival of goods will be sold out. The Hunan lead market in Hankou, due to the absorption of military factories, has few arrivals. After the broadcast of rumors on the market, the air is suddenly better, and the market is rising more and more. The current market price is $15.25 per load, which has risen by three or four 角 from the previous time. The business has become more lively. It is estimated that four or five hundred items were traded yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e271">The Noteworthy Kang-Tibetan Problem <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Ru</p>
<p>In order to attempt to resolve their own and each other’s contradictions, the imperialists cannot but redistribute the markets and implement a forcible redivision of the colonies. China, a semi-colonial country, is currently in a situation of being divided and dominated by the imperialists. Since the September 18th Incident, Japanese imperialists have successively seized our four northeastern provinces, and the division has already begun. Now, the Kang-Tibetan problem in the western border region has followed the northeastern problem. Undoubtedly, the invasion of the Sichuan-Kang region by Tibetan troops is a clear manifestation of the British imperialists’ desire to implement a forcible division of China.</p>
<p>Our country’s people seem to have an excessively narrow perspective. They only know about Japan and only know about the Northeast, and most of them indifferently view the border issues in the western region. In this way, the British imperialists will be able to further invade our country’s western border region, and take the opportunity of our people not having time to look west, to bring the western provinces into their grasp, which is also within their expectations. In the past, such as Annam becoming French, and Burma belonging to the British, wasn’t it the same situation?</p>
<p>The authorities have always paid little attention to the Kang-Tibetan problem, nor have they had the opportunity to pay attention. The so-called “Kang-Tibetan Reorganization Plan,” “Serious Negotiations with the British,” etc., are just like empty talk on paper, and have no effect at all. Recently, such as the telegram from Liu Wenhui, the commander-in-chief of Sichuan and Kang, asking for assistance, requesting the government to provide powerful assistance, but what kind of assistance will the government provide besides issuing a telegram ordering resistance? Perhaps this is beyond the reach of the whip?</p>
<p>It is inevitable that Liu Wenhui cannot resist the Tibetan troops under the command and utilization of the British imperialists. Recently, according to a report in the Chongqing Xinmin Daily, the Kang-Tibetan situation has eased, and the Kang side has also sent Jiang Yuwen as a representative to negotiate with the Tibetan side. This clearly shows that Liu Wenhui is helpless due to lack of assistance, so he compromised, so that the long-term resistance could not but change to short-term resistance, and then from short-term resistance to "peaceful resistance." However, the British imperialists' active armed invasion of Xikang will not end because of Liu Wenhui's compromise. On the contrary, the more "peaceful resistance" there is, the more it will promote the active invasion of Tibetan troops. As a result, the entire Xikang province will fall into the hands of the British.</p>
<p>The fact is indeed like this... According to a report in the Chengdu March 27th Minshi Daily... "The news of the Tibetan bandits invading the Jinsha River has been repeatedly disclosed in previous reports. Recently, they have shown their stubborn means, thinking of ways to implement their policy of aggression, regardless of their lives</p>
<p>Financial resources, actively invade incessantly. It is also heard that the pro-British Galun Lingrongxian is advocating the use of force to seize the lost land, and declares that if</p>
<p>If the war is defeated, would rather be a vassal of England than seek peace with the Han people..." The Chengdu Xinxin News also reported... "The Kang-Tibetan war is about to expand, and Tibetan troops are strengthening their support by crossing the Jinsha River. The talk of peace is now hopeless." (March 26th)</p>
<p>Chengdu is located in the west and close to Xikang, so these news, needless to say, are absolutely true. The British are striving for Xikang, not because of reconciliation and compromise, just as the Japanese are striving for the Northeast, not because of the non-resistance and not knowing to be grateful and stop moving forward. For the armed aggression of the imperialists against weak nations, only force can respond to force, an eye for an eye, blood for blood. This is the attitude that China should have today.</p>
<p>The Kang-Tibetan problem is becoming increasingly serious. I hope the people of the whole country will pay more attention to it!</p>
<h3 id="e272">Women Who Are Like Children Appeal for Peace <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>The war demon has been hovering in the sky for a long time, covering this magnificent land with a bleak shadow, foreshadowing the destruction of countless human lives under its bloody kiss. The traces of blood from the previous decade have not yet disappeared, and an even greater storm is about to rise, which has prompted humanitarians who cherish "compassion" to appeal for peace, making a big splash, while the cowardly and weak people are at a loss, crying incessantly. Recently, French women, amidst this sorrow and helplessness, have joined the "World Women's League" to promote the world peace movement, which is this manifestation. We see it in their "Church World Friendship Alliance," friends of Gandhi, and the International Women's Association, listed in the petition to the powerful church leaders of various countries, stating... "We, as the mothers of children, the children of the world are our children, how can we sit idly by and watch our children slaughter each other without lending a hand?" Almost every word is a tear. Then, such as "The world has entered a dangerous period. We, in the name of innocent children, and in the name of mothers who love children, earnestly request the spiritual authorities of the world to create a group of sacrifices, continue without ceasing, and demand that the governments of various countries lay down their butcher knives," it is ultimately exhausting the state of shedding tears and wiping tears, merely exclaiming, "Oh spirit is unclear, sending down this great evil."</p>
<p>Some say that "tears are a woman's weapon." It turns out that these women who are "so worried about current affairs that they cannot sleep or eat" have actually brought this magic weapon before the cruel and merciless god of war to use. Yuji in front of the tent still could not persuade the king's murderous heart to turn, let alone this petition, which is just an empty document, and throw it to the so-called "spiritual authorities" of church leaders in various countries? If all those who appeal for peace in the world were to imitate this "painstakingly" and follow after the "娘儿们" (women), then the day when true peace is realized would not know "where it will end." Because we are currently calling for peace and fighting for peace, it is by no means possible to achieve results by "begging" the spiritual authorities, but must have the following three points of understanding...</p>
<p>First, the reason why war is bound to erupt now</p>
<p>It is not that some killing star has descended, causing mankind to suffer this catastrophe, but rather the result of economic development under the current social system. Because the relations of production have become a state in which a minority of people monopolize the means of production and the vast majority of people sell their labor, they cannot escape overproduction, and therefore cannot escape economic crises, and its tide can be said to have激盪 the entire world. And from the perspective of the rulers who maintain the current system, in order to seek the elimination of economic panic, it can only come from the war of "re-dividing the world," so using the method of "requiring the governments of various countries to lay down their butcher knives" to pray for peace is tantamount to denying themselves. This way of calling for peace is either seeking a skin from a tiger, or deceiving others and deceiving oneself!</p>
<p>Second, the so-called "spiritual authority" of church leaders in various countries is actually the spreader of the various war-preparatory germs. On the one hand, under the protection of their crosses, they use the hypnosis of "motherland," "glory," and so on to drive people towards war. On the other hand, they use the empty words of ascension to heaven to make people withdraw from the practical activities of supporting peace, and fall into the passive self-destruction of listening to fate. It cannot be said that this group of humanitarians who cherish "benevolence" are the supplementers who destroy peace.</p>
<p>Third, just as cannonballs are merciless, most warmongers are also unreasonable. If you only rely on a few declarations and petitions to persuade them to "lay down their arms and return to their fields," that is more difficult than asking Zhang Fei to sing "Mao Mao Yu" (a sentimental love song). This point must be recognized, and one must not讳病疾医. The only way to oppose war is to use war to stop war. Let go of the cowardly child-like attitude, prepare the power of the people, and use the method of opposing the warmongering rulers to stop them.</p>
<p>It is a pity that the current "peace"-loving people do not plan this, but either recognize the thief as the father and live with the ghost, or sculpt the Buddha and worship it for self-comfort. Are there not many people now who want to use magical powers to summon the spirit of the Great Vehicle Supreme to seek its grace to save all sentient beings?</p>

<p>— Meng Jun</p>
<p>The moment I stepped inside, everything felt different. My listless heart began to stir. What I saw and heard was as if I had arrived in another country. If I weren't afraid that spring would be troublesome, I would definitely pursue the "spring" I was seeking here.</p>
<p>Someone inside already came to greet me, but I didn't understand their language, so I simply nodded and chose a seat. Then, a waiter who spoke our language approached and asked very politely, "Would you like to eat something?" My old friend Qi, who came with me, answered, "Beer, please."</p>
<p>Old friend Qi is an old hand at this. This was my first time with him. Although he told me beforehand:</p>
<p>"Just enjoy yourself, nothing else matters." But I, who don't understand the language, where do I even begin to enjoy myself? A glass filled with beer was brought before me, and I could only nod again, lift the glass, and take a sip.</p>
<p>My mouth was silent, but my heart was pounding</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>very hard.</p>
<p>A woman from here walked up to me and asked in English, "Do you speak English?" Heavens! This was a solution, because I can handle English.</p>
<p>"Of course! Please, sit down! Have a beer?" I pulled her down to sit.</p>
<p>At this moment, my gaze was entirely fixed on her. I didn't lightly pass over any part of her, paying full attention from head to toe. She wore a dark-colored silk dress with a floral print and wide, six- or seven-inch sleeves. Below the hip was a large, long drape. A very wide, multicolored silk belt was tightly wrapped around her chest, and on the back, it seemed like something was stuffed inside, protruding high. I really didn't understand what this meant, why insist on wrapping this cumbersome thing. But I thought it looked good. Perhaps it's not just for looks that she wears it?</p>
<p>"You're so beautiful!" I could only convey my meaning in English. She smiled at me slightly, leaned closer to me, reached out, and brought the glass to my lips. I drank a large gulp.</p>
<p>Everything felt different, especially that fleeting facial expression. If I weren't afraid that spring would be troublesome, I would definitely pursue the "spring" I was seeking here.</p>
<p>"Have a sip of this?" I switched the glass to her lips.</p>
<p>"I can't. Get me a coffee."</p>
<p>A moment later, the coffee was brought.</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>She told me, and I tried to pronounce it, but even after four or five tries, I still couldn't remember it clearly. A long and difficult-to-pronounce name. I can only remember the first three syllables: Fijisu... the rest I've forgotten.</p>
<p>Never mind that, I can recognize her whole person anyway. She seemed to have guessed my thoughts, and her whole body pressed close to me. A hot kiss was waiting for me.</p>
<p>She taught me to sing their songs, and I tried to learn. Pronouncing her name was hard enough; of course, the song was even worse. But the strange feeling had completely taken over my heart, and everything seemed meaningful.</p>
<p>She pulled away from my hands, stood up, moved with light steps to where the phonograph was, opened the lid, and started playing a Japanese song. Although I didn't understand what it was about, the brisk tune set off the cheerful atmosphere in the room perfectly. She stood by the phonograph, tapping her body and twisting her waist to the music, facing me, constantly sending over charming smiles. In that instant, I felt supreme, I had triumphed.</p>
<p>She returned to my side with even more passionate expressions. I couldn't even bother to pay attention to my surroundings, or see if my old friend Qi was as enraptured as I was!</p>
<p>After we left there and got on the streetcar, old friend Qi asked me with a rather smug tone: "Not bad, right? Exotic mood."</p>
<h3 id="e274">Girlfriend <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>It's really strange, recently I've run into many male friends, and they all ask each other if they have a girlfriend. If they do, they immediately heap endless praise on them, congratulate you repeatedly, and admire your skillful hand in successfully getting the objective. If not? Then they'll very sincerely pat you on the shoulder, tell you to put in some effort, try harder, or even promise to help you, feeling very surprised that male friends are generally so enthusiastic about pursuing girlfriends, everyone eager to find one for themselves. Open mouth girlfriend, close mouth girlfriend, as if there is nothing else matters, even introduce other's characters to you.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's because of their age, they're driven by strong physiological demands, emotion overriding reason, and they're unable to control themselves. This results in a kind of almost sexually frenzied behavior. I've carefully considered these situations, and while physiological pressure certainly</p>
<p>makes sense, there's another major reason: a misunderstanding of the concept of "girlfriend." Most people don't recognize that a girlfriend is not the same as a lover. Of course, a lover is derived from a girlfriend. But the reality isn't so simple. A girlfriend is a girlfriend, a lover is a lover. There is a clear distinction between them, and they shouldn't be considered one and the same. It's true that a lover often starts as a girlfriend, and a girlfriend can become a lover. But this isn't always the case. Some people have girlfriends all over the place. Can you say that all of their girlfriends are their lovers? Similarly, if you have girlfriends (let's assume you have quite a few), do you not have a friendship with these people, no interaction beyond friendship? This should be clear. A lover is one thing, a girlfriend is another. But many people misunderstand the term "girlfriend," and this misunderstanding leads to all sorts of laughable and tearful tragicomedies. I remember an old classmate of mine who was very close to a girlfriend, and she seemed affectionate as well. They often went to restaurants and movies together. But they never said anything about love, and the only physical contact was a handshake at parting. There was nothing else. It seemed like love but wasn't, confusing and bewildering, leaving the man restless and anxious day and night. Eventually, he bravely confessed his love to her, and she immediately turned hostile, angrily scolding him, saying that she respected his talent and knowledge and was happy to be friends, but didn't expect him to make such an absurd request. From then on, they broke off contact, and the man began to suffer from unrequited love, living a life of pain and misery. Situations like this are common. It's all your own fault, you can't blame the girlfriend's lack of affection. You just didn't see the difference between a girlfriend and a lover. But then again, many lovers grow out of a group of girlfriends. But this requires time and natural development, not force. It's best not to have a lover's expectations of a girlfriend.</p>

<p>— Jian Wu</p>
<p>Hopping on the streetcar on ×× Road, the wind blowing felt warm. For the first time, I sensed the arrival of spring. Seeing purple swallows darting like shuttles past the electric poles, it felt so familiar! That faint cooing, those black wings, it brought the news of spring from the north!</p>
<p>A neighboring child smiled and broke off a green willow branch. I stuck it on the windowsill. Every day, I look first at the green leaves welcoming the wind. They easily evoke thoughts of leaving home. I observed the color of the trees in the neighboring garden, reflecting a thick green. I sighed, "Spring is already abundant on the branches." Occasionally passing the entrance, several modern young women stood in a row, seemingly waiting for someone. Their powdered, drawn-out eyebrows always seemed to be smiling. Their sleeves were very, very high. It turned out that they had already changed into "light gauze wings" of outer garments, which further highlighted their graceful and lithe figures. I recognized spring in their jade hands. Only they could grasp spring.</p>
<p>Amateur Mailbox</p>
<h3 id="e276">Both Sides Have Comfort <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Editor,</p>
<p>I often see discussions about marriage in the Amateur Mailbox, but my marital problem is somewhat special. In my confusion, I have no choice but to trouble you as well. I trust that since you alleviate pain for everyone, you won't ignore me! Kind editor, please reply quickly! My heart eagerly awaits!</p>
<p>The facts are as follows: I have an uncle who left home at a young age to make a living in Jiangyin. Later, unfortunately, my grandparents passed away one after the other, and my uncle and</p>
<p>my mother did not get along, so he did not come home often. Later, he started a family in Jiang, and today he has a comfortable life, but my aunt has never had children and is already forty, so they often worry about having no descendants.</p>
<p>Since I understood things, I often wrote letters to comfort them, and they loved me very much. When my older sister got married (three years ago), they also returned home. In the midst of the joy, my aunt and uncle said to the crowd, "My older brother and sister-in-law only have this one son, and we only have this one nephew (me). The four of us will only rely on him in the future. When his parents marry him a wife, we will also marry him one in Jiangyin, so that both sides of our family will have comfort." At the time, everyone heard this but didn't take it seriously, just laughed for a while.</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, I had to drop out of school due to lack of funds. Later, feeling the pain of making a living, I was bored at</p>
<p>home, so I went to visit my aunt and uncle from afar. Once there, my aunt and uncle treated me very well. Soon after, I received a letter from a relative saying that they had found me a job and told me to go to Shanghai as soon as possible to work. In Jiang, my aunt and uncle mentioned a Miss Mou, who was very capable, and offered to be matchmakers for me. At that time, because I felt the difficulty of making a living, I said to them, "I'm still young, it's too early to talk about that!"</p>
<p>Last year, they sent several letters urging me to go to Jiangyin for the Lunar New Year. Because of their eagerness, I agreed. Who knew that after arriving in Jiangyin this time, they would bring up this matter again (more urgently than before)? During the New Year, they wanted me to go to her (the girl they mentioned) house to celebrate the New Year (her mother is my aunt's sister; she knew I was engaged since I was young? But she doesn't refuse because I'm engaged. She's sympathetic and wants to marry her daughter to me.) I was persuaded until I had no choice, so I agreed. On the second day of the New Year, I went to her house (my aunt and uncle went with me). When I arrived at her house, my aunt introduced me, but the girl was very natural and didn't care, and even called me "Brother." But I felt ashamed, and the word "Sister" never came out of my mouth. My aunt told me that she was very capable in handling household affairs, and also knew a little bit of how to read (because the family population is small, she doesn't go to school; she is an only child with no siblings). She is three years younger than me (I am now nineteen) and asked what I thought. However, I was very shy and just smiled without answering. But that girl, after seeing me, seemed to have known me for a long time, and her words and attitude were very natural. In my eyes, she is indeed a very good girl.</p>
<p>However, editor, I must also tell you that when I was very young (about five years old!), my parents arranged a marriage for me with a Miss Mou from about three miles away from home. However, I have never met her. I have asked several times, but it has never been possible, so what is that girl like? I don't know at all. In my heart, I hate her family for being too stubborn. Now I have several questions, and I beg you to answer them for me.</p>
<p>(1) Because of my special family relationship, can I have two wives? What crime is it legally? (The title of bigamy is inevitable)</p>
<p>(2) According to my choice, I am dissatisfied with the one from childhood. Can I deny it? Will it cost a lot of money to cancel the contract?</p>
<p>(3) After canceling the contract from childhood, what attitude and comfort should I have for my old mother? (Because my mother insists that she shouldn't be is what I expected.) If I carry it out, she might sacrifice herself for me.</p>
<p>(4) If I refuse the current one (from Jiangyin), my aunt and uncle's relationship with me and my parents will definitely be completely lost; their ardent hopes will also be vanished. In addition, doing so might intentionally make things difficult for my parents. (Selling half of his family property after going home, and recovering decades of rent on the fields, because the fields are all cultivated by my parents.) Or make my home not like a home. Wouldn't that be a pity? I want to take care of both sides, how should I deal with it?</p>
<p>Now I am standing on a dangerous cliff. If I do it poorly, it will be my lifelong pain and sorrow in the future. Sir, please release your compassionate heart and indicate everything. The matter is urgent, and I hope you will reply quickly. Best wishes, Xu Zhongjian</p>
<p>Answer: The editor believes that the reason why Mr. Xu has this problem is because he is only thinking about the family aspect and has not considered his personal future happiness, let alone his relationship with society. If Mr. Xu's uncle's proposal is followed and two wives are married for Mr. Xu, then not only will Mr. Xu feel the "difficulty of making a living" in the future, but also a great spiritual pain will inevitably occur. Moreover, the custom of polygamy and the concept of patriarchal lineage are customs under the feudal forces of the era when male power was superior. According to the principles of gender equality and modern ethical concepts, it is fundamentally unreasonable. Therefore, we hope for Mr. Xu's "one man, two wives."</p>
<p>From the perspective of social accomplishment and personal position, both should be resolutely opposed.</p>
<p>How should Mr. Xu deal with it? I believe that he should follow such principles: Marriage should be decided by his own will, and the choice should be based on the other party's character, mutual feelings, and, most importantly, whether they can help you develop your career, not on the opinions of the family. More importantly, you should not take a confused compromise method due to the difficulty of making a choice – one man, two wives.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu seems to like the marriage introduced by his uncle, so the editor believes that Mr. Xu can officially get engaged to the other party and cancel the original agreement of his parents. As for dissolving the marriage contract arranged by the parents, this mailbox often discusses that if they did not agree at the beginning and have reached legal adulthood, there is no problem in dissolving the contract. As for money, it depends on whether the other party has the right to compensation for damages and the size of the compensation. The editor cannot guess blindly.</p>
<p>As for the third and fourth difficulties, if Mr. Xu recognizes that "marriage is his own business, not getting married for the sake of his parents (or your uncle), I think it will not be a problem. You can explain to your parents that your marriage to the woman from Jiangyin is not to obey your uncle's orders, nor to oppose your parents. This fact is out of your own free will. In your opinion, your aunt and uncle are just matchmakers; moreover, even if you do not marry the woman from Jiangyin, you will also cancel your original marriage contract.</p>
<p>Of course, no matter how you explain to your mother, she may not be able to agree with you for a while, but we have a saying "Parents have two hearts, one is a loving heart, the other is a hateful heart." So if you continue to respect your parents very much in the future, and do not deliberately please your uncle, according to the editor's guess, your mother will definitely be able to understand you, and she will not sacrifice for you.

<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>The year before last was the heyday of Chinese education in Siam. The opening of secondary schools, the establishment of kindergartens, the holding of joint academic competitions among schools, and large-scale joint sports meets all caused a sensation for a while. A kind of enthusiastic and lively atmosphere permeated the entire Siamese Chinese community. But soon it suffered an unexpected blow, and that was the so-called compulsory education ordinance promulgated by the Siamese government.</p>
<p>Originally, compulsory education exists in all countries, but the regulations promulgated by Siam last year broke the usual international customs. They not only limited the children of this country to receive this education, but also included our overseas Chinese children in the compulsory list. In other words, we must abandon the characters of our blessed country to read their Siamese books. It is very obvious that we want to assimilate our three million overseas Chinese! At that time, although the schools had pleaded with them, they finally failed due to internal inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Now, Chinese schools have been changed to teach Siamese language. Only a small number of students who are over the age they specify (over 15 years old) or whose Siamese level is sufficient can read Chinese books. But this is an extremely small number. Therefore, we can say that overseas Chinese education in Siam is now completely bankrupt!</p>
<p>8. Conclusion</p>
<p>At present, the overseas Chinese in Siam are really at a time of great crisis. If we do not find a way to save it, the future is really unimaginable! I think that on the one hand, we must ask the government to quickly sign a treaty with Siam, so that all problems can be solved easily. But more importantly, it is the awakening of the compatriots themselves. As long as everyone abandons local concepts, concentrates talents and economy, and is of one mind, it will not be difficult to return to the golden age before, because Siam is an agricultural country and its industry is still very immature. The manufacture of all daily necessities can be done greatly at present. As for the increased exorbitant taxes of the resident government, we should argue with reason on the one hand, and improve factory management with scientific methods on the other hand to reduce costs. We must never do our duty by eating, and be humble. Speaking of agriculture, what has been reclaimed now is only the alluvial land in the middle and estuary of the Chao Phraya River, which is less than one-tenth of the total area of Siam. The rest of the vast wilderness can also be developed greatly. It is not absolutely impossible to abolish or amend harsh laws such as compulsory education and immigration regulations. In short, the success or failure of overseas Chinese in Siam in the future depends on whether everyone can wake up? (End)</p>

<h3 id="e280">The Making of the "The Good Earth" Film <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The making of the "The Good Earth" film based on Pearl S. Buck's novel has been a matter of much debate for a long time, but now the decision has been made to begin filming. Since Mr. Hill (George W. Hill) led the staff of MGM to Shanghai,</p>
<p>the outside world knows very little about the progress of the "The Good Earth" film. In fact, they have been making rapid progress in collecting materials everywhere for several weeks. Mr. Hill has now announced the progress of the work, and the mystery of the film world has finally been solved.</p>
<p>Mr. Hill is the director of "The Good Earth" film. He strongly advocates taking materials on the spot for this important film, and abandoning all fake scenes. Therefore, he personally traveled thousands of miles to Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Beijing, and inland villages. He led the specialist technicians of MGM to capture real backgrounds. The arduousness of the work is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. Someone asked him what was going on? He said, "That's hard to answer. We are filming everything on the spot, from the mattresses of the rich to the farming tools of the farmers."</p>
<p>He also said, "Some people suspect that we are splitting China. In fact, we are indeed collecting everything and preparing to build a miniature China in Hollywood." He also said, "We are not satisfied with just imitation. We bought them and shipped them back to Hollywood. As of now, we have shipped about 190 boxes to Hollywood, and nine-tenths of our work has been completed. After that, we will spend several months completing our set. The "The Good Earth" film may be shown to the world in late autumn this year or early spring next year."</p>
<p>Mr. Hill is quite interested in China and hopes to revisit the old place in a few years. At that time, he plans to rent a houseboat and travel leisurely to the interior of China. In his mind, Beijing is the most worthy of nostalgia in the world. He found that Chinese people are good at cooperation. The National Government has appointed two people to help them, and a dozen wealthy Chinese people are very happy to present their treasures. Therefore, he has a good opportunity to see private collections of gems, ancient bronzes, and luxurious decorations. He admires the essence of China very much. He praised that the Chinese people's etiquette is not a kind of lip service, because sometimes he loves something so much that the owner generously gives it to him.</p>
<p>Pearl S. Buck's novel tells the story from 1906 to the present, and it is all set in China. He said, "We should have Chinese costumes. The protagonists and ordinary actors should wear costumes from one era to another." Therefore, he hired Chinese craftsmen to design patterns for several months. Specialist technicians and photographers spared no effort to capture the real scenery of China, hoping not to lose the life of the Chinese people as described by Pearl S. Buck. They went to Nanjing again yesterday. After a few weeks, they will pack up and return to the United States.</p>

<h3 id="e281">Review of "Little Women" <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Ping · Xun Zhi Ling He</p>
<p>"Little Women" 丨 Grand Shanghai 丨</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>The protagonist, Yu, in "Little Women" is the author, Louisa May Alcott herself, and everything in "Little Women" is her own experience.</p>
<p>Yes, this novel, a narrative poem of ordinary and trivial American family life, is widely popular. Sixteen years ago, William Brady adapted it into a stage play, and later it was made into a silent film; now, in the era of sound films, it has been remade into a talkie.</p>
<p>This is a world-famous literary work, but not all famous literary works are worth accepting; critical work is needed here.</p>
<p>The exchange between the literary and film worlds is not necessarily a bad phenomenon in modern times. In the impoverished Chinese film scene, marked by the release of "Spring Silkworms," a new path for Chinese literary films has been opened, although it was soon hit. However, it is easy to understand that we cannot casually deceive the audience with "literary films." When film merchants use the original work as a selling point, we should take a more serious attitude to criticize it.</p>
<p>Naturally, "Little Women" has its own considerable value; it depicts the little women of modern society – a group of virtuous wives and good mothers.</p>
<p>This group resents and yet submits to their wealthy aunt; they are filial to their parents, loving to their sisters; they are pleased and grateful for the gifts and favors of the wealthy; they give humane and generous alms to a poor family with a newborn child; they have no ideals or prospects for their future, or want to be a superhuman writer – all this is their life, the so-called "little women" and "good wives."</p>
<p>The author's view of life expressed in "Little Women" is, to put it precisely, just a kind of "philosophy of contentment with poverty." Therefore, the characters in the work are all content with their lot, optimistic, and believe in fate. Their highest goal is to work diligently and earnestly in this society to be a "good person," a good daughter, a good sister, and a good wife. There is poverty, misfortune, and sorrow in this story, but those poor protagonists only show sorrow and obedience, without the slightest thought.</p>
<p>At the same time, the more important point is that in this circle, everyone is a good person. The four sisters go without saying; the parents, Laurie, Brooke, Professor Bhaer, and even the aunt we dislike – within this group, there is absolutely no concept of self-interest or selfish thoughts among them. On the contrary, they only have sympathy, compassion, joy, and gratitude. In other words, these people seem very, very far removed from us. To describe them with a phrase they often use, they are all angels, all superhumans. The original author and the filmmakers have worked hard on this kind of benevolent "self-denial" doctrine. On the contrary, whether in the novel or on the screen, they have very wonderfully presented a picture of harmony. Watching this work will take you to a paradise, a utopia, and make you forget the ugliness and anger of the world. We can sympathize with such good people, and at the same time, people with this kind of goodness do exist in modern society. However, when we sympathize emptily, we will forget the anger of reality. When we are moved by the innocence and kindness of the protagonists in the play and shed tears and give smiles, at this time we will dissipate our sorrow for reality. Advising people to be content with poverty, to restrain themselves, to resolve the resentment accumulated in real society, and to obscure the observation of social problems – these are the objective tasks pursued by the life view of "Little Women."</p>
<p>We must consider the objective performance of the work, and we must see who welcomes the work, and we should be more cautious. The simultaneous public screening of "The Outlaw" and "Little Women" provides us with a good comparison. We believe that "The Outlaw" is far more worthy of praise than "Little Women." If we feel like watching "Little Women" but haven't seen "The Outlaw," then we sincerely and seriously offer a piece of advice to our dear readers – go see "The Outlaw" first!</p>

<p>"Little Women" is an American home life story. It can be said that the characters in "Little Women" are ordinary American people. Their experiences are also experiences that can happen anytime, anywhere in the United States.</p>
<p>In order to poeticize and beautify this ordinary and trivial story, and "make the audience cry sympathetically and smile knowingly," the filmmakers have worked hardest on the depiction of the environment, and this point has achieved considerable success. The screenwriters (Herrman and Mason) are also very good at deleting cumbersome details and narrating this long story quite smoothly. Of course, here we can only say that they are competent, without special expression. Especially in the part after Meg and Brooke's marriage, it is slightly lax. Afterwards, probably because they were eager to proceed towards the ending, it gradually became disorganized. Of course, the famous acting skills of Hepburn and Paul Lukas saved many of these shortcomings.</p>
<p>The director of "Little Women" is very successful in the delicate and vivid depiction of personality. For example, Yu sold her hair for money, but in the evening, she regretted her lost hair. Yu's innocence and emotional personality are portrayed.</p>
<p>Another point is that the director is very capable of controlling and manipulating the audience's emotions, from joy to sorrow, from sorrow to joy, all depicted appropriately. For example, at the beginning, a group of innocent children are happy, and their mother comes in and tells them that their father has sent a letter. Then, the mother slowly reads the letter, but before the letter is finished, several close-ups show that the daughters are already in tears. This scene is very moving. This technique was used again when they received the telegram about their father's illness. 丨丨 Several places of grief and sorrow in the original work are handled very well. The most outstanding are the sections of Yu selling her hair and Beth's illness. When Beth is critically ill, Mei pretends that sleep is death, deliberately making a shocking stroke, also exerting the ability to manipulate the audience's emotions to the extreme.</p>
<p>The success of most of this play lies in the successful individual performance of Hepburn. Perhaps it can be said that it almost makes us imagine that Alcott's original work was written for her. The whole article is impeccable, this person is Kerr. The great reputation is not easily achieved in vain.</p>
<p>Speaking of acting, Francis Dee's Meg is also very successful. In the section before her engagement, she looks out the window, tidies up her eyebrows in the mirror, sees Yu, is embarrassed, but cannot hide the joy in her heart. After talking to Yu, her fiancé comes in, panting, pretending to be calm, but with a very surprised expression in his heart – one of the daughters will be screened in Nanjing soon.</p>
<p>, indeed, she performed vividly. Lukas' Professor Bhaer is also good.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Taking this film as an example, we may as well look at the different points between novels and movies. On the one hand, this is because the capacity of about 10,000 feet of film is definitely not as rich as a novel of hundreds of thousands of words, so the entire novel cannot be put on the screen. More importantly, the two have their own unique styles and techniques, so what is expressed on the screen is no longer exactly the same as the novel. Here, we may as well give one or two specific examples.</p>
<p>The first chapter of the original book describes the outline of each person's personality, and the center of the story is the preparation of Christmas gifts for Mama. But on the screen, it first explains the environment at the time, and then individually writes about the business and life of each little girl from Mama down. This visualizes what is said in one or two sentences in the novel, and at the same time, there are differences in the timing.</p>
<p>On Christmas morning, when Mama returns from outside, the dialogue in the original book is:</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas, Mama! Thank you for your books," the four daughters said in unison. "We have read them, and we will read them every day from now on."</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas to you, my children," Mama said. "I am very happy that you have read them, and I hope you will continue to read them. However, I have something to tell you. There is a woman sleeping in the house next door, and there is a newborn child. Six children are huddled together on a bed so that they don't freeze to death, because there is no fire in their house. They have nothing to eat, so her eldest child came to tell me and asked me to help them. My girls, can you give them your breakfast as a Christmas gift?"</p>
<p>"Luckily you came quickly," Yu said. "We haven't eaten it yet."</p>
<p>"May I be allowed to go with you," Beth said. "To distribute these things to those poor children?"</p>
<p>"I'll take the butter and scones," Mei said.</p>
<p>"I know you're willing," the mother said. "You all go and help. When you come back, we'll eat some bread and milk for breakfast, and have a good lunch."</p>
<p>But the dialogue in the movie is as follows:</p>
<p>"Sausage! Where did it come from?" Yu opened the lid and said loudly.</p>
<p>"And scones! Just two for each person," Mei also said happily. Then the eldest daughter, Meg, said:</p>
<p>"And coffee!" Then Beth sighed and said:</p>
<p>"I'm afraid Father doesn't have coffee to drink!"</p>
<p>"I remember," the old maid said. "In those years, there was coffee on your father's table every day." Then Mei said innocently and surprisingly:</p>
<p>"Really? Then we were very rich in the beginning."</p>
<p>At this time, after returning from outside and receiving the gifts from her daughters, she said: "Children, wait a moment, I just came from the house next door. They just had a new baby, and the mother and six children are all sleeping. They are cold and hungry, and they only have one quilt, so they are hugging each other to keep warm. Good daughters, would you be willing to give them your breakfast as a Christmas gift?"·········</p>
<p>From the above examples, we can know the special techniques of movies. Movies do not have to rely on literary psychological descriptions, and the screen must be concise and clear, using action to replace words. Sound movies have strengthened the effect of dialogue, so the personality of each character can be described in the dialogue. For example, Beth said, "I'm afraid Father doesn't have coffee to drink!" can show her gentle and kind nature. Yu's masculinity is expressed in the way she speaks. As for Mei's childish selfishness, it is also expressed in the unwillingness she shows when she finally picks up a pot of vegetables.</p>
<p>Well, in the movie, the playwright has indeed understood the essence of the original work and fully used the techniques of film. On the other hand, if the order of the story is based on the original work and is exactly the same, then the result will inevitably be dull and redundant. Here, it strongly answers Mr. Mu Tian's question of whether "Spring Silkworms" should be the same as the original work. At the same time, in this film, we can learn some screenwriting techniques for literary films.</p>

<p>Due to space limitations, we have to stop here. However, for this film that shook America, it is time for a great criticism.</p>
<h3 id="e282">"White Mountains, Black Waters, and a Beautiful Heart" Returns from Hangzhou Filming <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Xu Xinfu's new film, "White Mountains, Black Waters, and a Beautiful Heart," went to Hangzhou on the third of this month to shoot outdoor scenes. In addition to Xu Xinfu, the team included the film's actors Hu Die, Wang Zhengxin, and the chubby child You Guangzhao, as well as the cinematographer Yan Bingheng. They filmed for three days at places such as the Liuhe Pagoda and the Nine Creeks and Eighteen Gorges in Hangzhou, and the results were satisfactory and the work went smoothly. The team has now returned to Shanghai, and the film "White Mountains, Black Waters, and a Beautiful Heart" has now been completely filmed.</p>
<h3 id="e283">"Abandoned Love" to Open Soon <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>On the 16th at the "Beijing" Theater</p>
<p>The film "Abandoned Love," produced by Guoqiang Film Company, has taken more than three months and cost thousands of yuan since December last year to complete the work of filming and sound recording. The results were satisfactory. It has now been reviewed by the Nanjing Film Censorship Committee and the Shanghai Concession Film Censorship Committee, and is scheduled to premiere at the Beijing Grand Theater on the sixth of this month.</p>
<p>The company is now preparing the second all-sound dialogue film script, "The Zhao Family." It is still directed by Ji Fansan, and written and starred by Zhao Yingcai. The female lead was once recruited, but has now been hired, with Ms. Chen Yin and Ms. Qing Ping taking on the role.</p>
<h3 id="e284">After the Establishment of the Revival Comrades Association, the Mingxing Company Has a New Look <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>Mingxing Company is the earliest and largest film company in the history of Chinese cinema. In recent years, it has been hit by various unexpected setbacks such as the "Romance of Laughter and Tears" disputes, and has fallen into difficult circumstances. Recently, the unexpected success of "Twin Sisters" has made the situation optimistic in all aspects, so it immediately initiated the organization of the "Revival Comrades Association" established on April 1, changing the organization, revising the rules, and giving the internal structure a completely new look.</p>

<p>"Children of the Times" Passed</p>
<p>Ai Xia has been dead for two months, and her destruction is a great loss to the film industry, but there is no way to bring her back to life, and regret is only futile. Ai Xia's posthumous works that have not been released publicly only include three, namely "Golden Valley," "Children of the Times," and "Two Against One" (talkie). Now "Two Against One" is about to be completed, and "Children of the Times," directed by Li Pingqian, has recently passed the Nanjing Film Censorship Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e286">Recent News of the Silver Screen Little Troublemakers <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang You</p>
<p>A few years ago, we often saw a team of male, female, beautiful, ugly, fat, thin, honest, and cunning child stars in films. They were dedicated to filming comical short films for various companies. They were famous for making trouble. In Hollywood, they often joked and played pranks with the big stars, making the film city turned upside down. So people gave them a nickname called the Silver Screen Little Troublemakers.</p>
<p>Previously, this group of little troublemakers was very young and very smart, so the comedies they starred in were very popular with the audience. But time flies, and now they have all grown up! It is really no longer suitable for them to play those slapstick, troublemaking films, so recently there has been no trace of this group of little troublemakers on the screen! Although a few talented individuals, such as Jackie Cooper, Dick Moore, and Spanky McFarland, have been continuously hired by major companies, most people are ignored. But they all have rich theatrical experience and skills, so how can they be buried like this! So they joined forces and went to New York, preparing to use the stage as a training ground to make a comeback. It is said that they have now been hired by a large theater on Broadway.</p>
<p>The film novel "Sound and Shadow Record" is temporarily suspended for a day or two due to the non-arrival of the sequel manuscript.</p>
