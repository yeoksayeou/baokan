<h3>總理誕辰紀念感言</h3>
<p>— 讓</p>
<p>韶光忽忽。又屈孫中山先生誕辰。時人慨念孫先生成就於邦國之大。顧兹時會艱難。每於其誕生之日。藉文字以發抒其感慨者夥矣。然則今兹紀念。又有何言乎。曰世界之風雲日亟。一九三五年之危機。迫在眉睫。總理之生。爲救國拯民而生。則總理後死之吾人。其將如何凛然知懼。以仰體總理遺志。發揚蹈厲以赴之乎。吾人不敏。願揭數旨。爲國人告。</p>
<p>近代國家政治之組織。類皆有一致的趨向。嚴密與集中是。尤其自一九二九世界經濟恐慌發生以後。爲域日廣。爲患日深。國際政治相隨激盪。社會秩序。騷亂堪虞。當國者對兹世界多難之際。知政治權力有改弦更張之需。於是議會政治。漸次傾頽。中央集權於焉强化。務使上下貫通。如臂使指。以圖應付倉卒挽救狂瀾之便利。考之東西。要已不爽。此無他。培養國力。應自組織始也。吾國自滿清顛覆以來。政治向不上軌。東焉美制。雖多試行。然實行議會政治。而議員變成猪仔。以黨訓政。則又意見紛歧。鮮裨國是。迄今國難日亟。朝野上下。問其中心信仰。則并偶像之崇拜而無之。人之譏我無組織也亦宜。夫全國之力。自組織而生。其組織嚴密者力自强。倘國家如一盤散沙。而猶囂囂然希望復興民族。挽救國難。得毋緣木求魚。捨本逐末之甚乎。雖然。欲求組織之嚴密。厥爲中央之强化。此强化之中央。又須有衆人信仰之領袖。方可鎮攝禍患。爭我生爭。然則今日中國之領袖。誰足當之。又誰爲擁護之耶。此種問題。人多諱言。實則此領袖問題。實不成爲問題。而亦不必諱言。其果具堅强實力。且有捨已爲公之精神。人民自必擁戴之。既擁戴矣。亦自無所用其謙遜。蓋國難至此。能毅然出任者。純係犧牲而絶無權利。今日之能犧牲而不私權利者有幾人也。</p>
<p>今之方經國者。每曰一團亂麻。無從措手。言剿匪則此伏彼起。事倍功半。言財政則百孔千瘡。山窮水盡。言經濟則天災頻仍。農村破産。言外交更苟延殘喘。偷安不得。他如國防軍備。更無論焉。其不淪於悲慘之厄運者幾希。然而環顧國内。高論雖多。困獸不鬥。即以社會上層頷袖言。誠能脚踏實地立志苦幹者。亦不多覩。類因昧於救國之道。或太重於私圖。以致巧取豪奪。不務本位。循使綱紀蕩然。風氣日壞。此種窮而不變之情勢。敢担保其愈久而愈不通。貽害所至。勢不至斷送國脈不止。吾人若不能急起糾正。則新生活運動可以不談。禮義廉恥更不必説。坐使社會之利害懸隔愈甚。階級之仇視加深。今日而欲急加糾正。則不得不有望於心地純正。埋頭苦幹。邁步勇進者。</p>
<p>抑又爲當局告者。今之言培養國本。必不容忽視民力。而所謂民力。實即人民之體力與財力。但今之中國。論體力愚弱日甚。論財力十室九空。政府近雖積極致力於體育之提倡。消極注意於麻醉品之取締。顧此沉痼之疾。未易立起。况以財力虧損。民不聊生。細民生計。不絶如縷。此固國家生産力之不振。直接由於帝國主義不斷的經濟侵略。然不能克盡保護之責。究亦咎無可辭。政府之建設。不能澤被平民。一也。國家之吏治。未能加以澄清。而每多擾民。二也。關税既不能有裨於内國實業。税捐反日以加增。國民幾成爲半乞丐的國民。則將令其如何抗禦外侮。復興祖國。總理有言。「建設之首要在民生。」其於民生主義與民族民權關聯之切。尤反復言之。足見衣食不週。不足言救國。此則政府當局應先注重充實民力以振民氣。庶爲當前急務耳。</p>
<p>六十九年前誕生之總理。方當清季敗亂之世。其動念革命。則由於國勢之警惕。今總理逝世亦已十的矣。而世事益非。國危至此。獨未能刺激上下。起而把握遺教。力行不舍。是豈眞茫然而無知耶。斯知而不行也。悲夫。</p>

<p>主席報告</p>
<p>公推楊志豪主席、行禮如儀後、主席報告云、立法院新近修正之刑法、對奸淫未滿十六歲女子凖强奸論罪一條、降低至十四歲、殊與女子健康有碍、蓋十四歲之女子、發育尚未健全横遭强暴、實足以摧殘其一生幸福、又刑法第二百三十九條有夫之婦、與人通奸、處一年以下有期徒刑、相奸者亦同、而於有婦之夫、獨未有規定、首都婦女界、曾一再反對、恊進會於理事會决議、特召集各團體、一致力爭、</p>
<p>會議情形</p>
<p>旋經討論、僉謂立法、院變更未滿十六歲爲十四歲、殊屬失當、翻閲報章、女子之横被污辱者、不堪勝數、舊法規定年齡較大、尚有如許違法情事、設改十四歲、則不啻予男子以特殊便利、間接且足以摧殘整個女性之保障、至於二百三十九條獨限於女子而疏於男子、又予男子以特殊權利、殊屬不合、</p>

<h3>夫或婦通姦問題王寵惠談科罪範圍</h3>
<p>取法各國法律規定於民法内</p>
<p>中央社云、立法院此次通過刑法草案第二百三十九條、有夫之婦與人通姦者、處一年以下有期徒刑、其相姦者亦同、第於有婦之夫與人通姦或相姦者、則法無科罪之規定、以致引起京滬各地婦女界激烈之抗爭、中央社記者、昨特往訪世界聞名之法學博士王寵惠氏、詢以對於此項問題之意見、據王博士談、有夫之婦與人通姦者科罪、而有婦之夫與人通姦者則否、此固根據生理學上之理由、各國百年前之舊法律、莫不如是、即迄今亦有三四國仍奉行、我國亦其一也、惟此雖根據生理學上之理由、然確有背乎男女平等之原則、但此次京滬各地婦女團體要求對於有婦之夫與人通姦者亦科以同等之罪、在事實上、亦難以實行、蓋因此項法律實行之後、娶妾者固皆刑事犯也、我國娶妾者達百分之三十以上、是則以全國之監獄、盡禁此有婦之夫與人通姦罪者、尚嫌不足矣、本人以爲有夫之婦或有婦之夫犯通姦者、可規定於民法範圍之内、不必視爲刑事犯、而以懲罰之責任屬諸社會、及個人道德之修餐、學問之研究、宗教之信仰、世界各國之法律大多如是、我國亦可取法也云云、</p>

<p>資産階級、是不需要合作社的、需要合作的、是中等以下階級、我國從前有一種互助辦法、一個人如果需要一百元、可以向十個親友各借十塊錢、以後分期還清、這是舊法、現在這經濟信用合作社、是新的法子、比舊法好得多、它把社友的儲金、拿去投資、拿去借給社友、可以説每人都帮助人了人、每人都得到他人的帮助、我國提倡合作、大約遠在十五年以前、可是成績並不好、現在這個經濟合作社、是有希望的、一定能够發展的、上海全市、除了一部分資本家以外、至少有三十六萬人、是需要加入合作社的、就是打個對折、也有十八萬人、就是再打對折、還要有九萬人、現在人數、僅僅只有千餘人、是因爲大家不大明白其中利益、大家一明白、自然會來參加的、試問加入社友、不但兼有儲蓄保壽二種的利益、而且還有各種貸款各種顧問·以及消費低廉種種利益、那一家銀行儲户、那一家保壽公司保户、有這麽大的利益、現在拿萬國儲蓄會來説、他是拿大多數會員的錢、供極少數人得奬、而會中又從中得利的、他有各種貸款的利益嗎、没有、他有各種顧問的利益嗎、没有、他的錢、是拿來投資有益社會有益會員的事業嗎、不是、他是拿去買外國公債票、是替外國人謀利益的、這和經濟合作社比較、不是相差得很遠嗎、加入萬國儲蓄會的利益、不如經濟合作社遠甚、而現在萬國儲蓄會的會員人數、至少在十萬人以上、所以經濟合作社的將來、是一定能够發展的、萬國儲蓄會在最初成立時、會員人數、也不過二千人、和現在經濟合作社的人數差不多、我們現在不必爲了人數不多而失望、要知道「作始也簡、將畢也鉅」、只要社友每人每年能够介紹十個人入社、明年二週紀念、便有一萬多社友了、</p>
<p>林康侯之演詞</p>
<p>該社基金保管委員會主席林康侯演説、略謂、不講經濟、便没有信用、没有信用、便不能合作、我們是既講經濟、又講信用、又講合作的、不但社中負責職員如此、即社友個人、也應該如此、本人負責保管基金、是嚴密的保管、認眞的保管、從没有偷懶過、從没有馬虎過、我們都是重信用的、絲毫不肯苟且、希望社友及來賓、大家一傳十、十傳百、使一般民衆、都知道我們的信用、都來加入合作、</p>
<p>何德奎之演詞</p>
<p>工部局會辦何德奎演説、略謂合作社的發達、有三個條件、第一要有信用、第二要有生活相似須要相同的社員、第三要有固定的住所、美國合作社的發達、不如德國·英國、就是因爲缺乏了第二·第三·二點、現在本社的負責人、是張壽鏞·林康侯·丘漢平、諸人、都是社會上信譽很隆的、第一個條件、是不成問題的、第二個條件、照潘局長剛才打的折扣、上海生活相似需要相同的人、至少也有幾萬人、也是不成問題的、第三個條件、住在上海的、雖然一部份人是流動、但是大部份還是固定的、所以這三個條件都具備、本社前途、是一定發展的、合作社本來是經濟上的意義、然而在政治上也有間接影響、經濟上合作的結果、使一般民衆、在政治上也能够團結、不至成爲一盤散沙、上海須要合作社、内地尤其須要合作社、上海是領導内地的、本社辦的成績好、將來内地羣起效法、推廣起來、一定是大有成績的、</p>
<p>擴大徵求給奬</p>
<p>演説畢、時間已不早、乃舉行本年擴大徵求給奬禮、由主席授以各種銀盾髣合作先鋒旗、計徵求份數最多、得奬者爲劉道芳·丘漢平·夏夙岐·三組、徵求人數最多得奬者、爲劉道芳·夏夙岐·趙錫光·三組、個人徵求份數最多得奬者、爲謝筱初·羅友翔·江鎮三·三人、徵求人數最多得奬者、爲謝筱初·俞庭玉·奚成元·三人、當時人衆、雖極擁擠、而會場秩序、甚爲良好、張·丘·潘·林·何·等演説時、大受聽衆鼓掌、給奬後、舉行茶點攝影、</p>
<p>午後開游藝會</p>
<p>散會後、羣衆擁至八仙橋黄金大戲院、社友來賓入場者、絡繹不絶、計參加人數、比紀念增加至數倍、約二千餘人、樓下樓上、均告客滿、銀月歌舞團、全體三十餘人、皆係少女、色藝雙佳、總指揮爲張蟾蛾女土、自十二時二十分、表演至二時、預定節目、除草裙艶舞改爲小蝴蝶外、均一一演完、演紅顔軍·求愛·丁香山·小蝴蝶·等節目時、尤博觀衆歡迎、掌聲雷動、聞該團係黎錦暉所領導、訓練有素、在木市表演以來、觀衆不下數百萬人、此次表演、純係義務、</p>

<h3>錢塘江橋籌備報告（續）</h3>
<p>（丁）設計研究</p>
<p>任何工程計設、皆應以堅固、適用、經濟、美觀爲前提、材料、式樣不妨變換、但橋梁理論、工程界已趨一致、以同一條件、同一市價、無論如何建築、如爲合理設計、其經費不能相差過遠、本橋設計條件前已詳述、最初由浙建廳函請美國橋梁專家、華德爾博士設計、橋工委員會成立後、復經多時研究、擬定設計原則、（一）錢江水淺、而沙灘變遷無常、爲顧及航行關係、橋墩距離、以相等爲宜、（二）本橋爲鐵路公路聯合橋、應顧及各種運輸之需要、且橋長一公里、須謀運輸之通暢、以節時間、（三）本橋關係國防、應顧及軍事上之防禦、（四）杭洲爲風景勝地、本橋設計應顧及兩岸觀瞻、兹將所擬六種設計略述如次、</p>
<p>（一）一百二十呎之上托梁、共二十九孔、計長三四八○呎、梁高十四呎、其優點、在佈置之經濟、上爲鐵路、下爲行人道、兩旁翅臂爲公路、所有桁梁隙地、均充分利用、而橋墩尺寸、亦大爲縮小、此種鐵路公路聯合橋之設計、在橋梁史上、尚屬創格、堪稱新穎、惜徑間小於規定、且公路來去單行、無避車之餘地、以本橋之長恐有阻碍交通之慮、</p>
<p>（二）一百五十三呎之下承桁梁、共二十三孔、計長三五一九呎、橋身係雙層建築、梁高二十五呎、下爲鐵路、上爲公路、及人行道、此種式樣於鐵路及公路之交通、最爲便利、</p>
<p>（三）一百六十四呎之下承桁梁、共二十一孔、計長三四四四呎、梁高二十七呎、中爲鐵路、旁爲公路及人行道、用翅臂梁支持與鐵路同層並列、</p>
<p>（四）一百八十四呎之下承桁梁、共十九孔、計長三四九六呎、梁高二十八呎、其佈置與第二種相同、</p>
<p>（五）二百二十呎之下承桁梁、共十六孔、計長三五二○呎、梁高三十五呎、其佈置與第二種相同、</p>
<p>（六）三百一十呎之下承桁梁、共十一孔、計長三四一○呎、因徑間甚長、兩梁相距較闊、故採用鐵路公路單層平列式、桁梁構造亦改爲灣弦、藉减重量、</p>
<p>以上連同華德爾博士之設計共爲七種抉擇取捨、頗費研究、每種皆有其優異之處、而不能各方俱顧十全十美、惟有求其比較經濟者採用、經委員會之慎重考慮、認爲二百二十呎之設計、最爲妥當、因决定以此招標、並繪具各部詳圖、以便估價、此計劃之概要如下、</p>
<p>在錢塘江控制綫一公里以内設置雙層鋼梁橋十六孔每孔二百二十英尺共長三五二○英尺、上層中爲公路兩旁人行道、下層爲單綫鐵道、橋身高三十五英尺、桁梁相距二十英尺、採用華倫式之構造接筍處、悉用　釘上層公路　橋面係鋼筋混凝土之建築、計厚七寸、承托於縱横鋼梁之上、與花梁之上弦相接、下層鐵路橋面、由鋼軌木枕及縱横梁組成、聯接於花梁之直桿、上下兩弦、皆有禦風梁架、採用鉚釘聯結式、所有内部設計、悉按規範書計算、全橋橋墩十五座、悉用鋼筋混凝土建築墩内留置空穴、以便减輕重量、上承橋座之處、墩蓋長三十三·五尺、寛十呎、兩端圓收墩座深入高水位下七十呎、其近南岸之九墩每墩下承木樁一百六十根、每根載重三十五噸、長約一百呎、北岸之六墩因石層較淺、用沉箱氣壓法、使墩座沉至堅石、不用木樁、正橋盡頭、各設引橋搗墩一座、南岸用木樁法、北岸用沉箱法、墩外設拱橋及混凝土樁梁、爲公路引橋之用、下層鐵路則於橋堍起用墊土建築與兩岸之鐵路接軌、</p>
<p>（戊）招標情形</p>
<p>設計確定從事招標、除凖備圖樣外、並擬定中英文之工程規範書及標單程式、俾作凖繩、規範書内容、係遵照鐵道部頒之章則標單程式、則顧及國内建築廠家情形、將全橋工程分爲九標、藉便選擇、於本年四月十五日、登報招商承辦、計陸續來處領取標單圖樣者、共三十二家、其中本國十七家、外商十五家、（内德商五家、英商四家捷商二家、法·日·荷·丹各一家）、原定六月十八日開標、嗣經投標人一再要求延期、至八月二十二日舉行、届時由鐵道部派滬杭甬路工務處副處長、濮登青、浙省府派建設廳秘書主任張鑑暄、財政廳科長唐世鑑、監視開標、計共投到標單十七份、内本國九家、外商八家、由監視委員逐一拆封宣讀、並將各標總價列表公佈、當晚工程處職員復澈夜工作、將各標投報數字逐一核對、並將九標標價及材料、工作單價、分别造具比較表十五種、以便翌日審查標單之用、</p>
<p>（己）審標定標</p>
<p>本橋工程偉大、而標單内容複雜、爲慎重起見、先後由浙省組織標單審查委員會、鐵道部組織設計審查委員會、延攬國内工程專家、悉心研究、計標單委員會主任委員、陳體誠·委員華南圭·浚鴻勛·鄭華·德斯福·濮登青·周象賢·葉家俊·朱耀庭·張自立·侯家源·茅以昇·羅英·設計委員會主任委員孫謀·委員顔德廢·陳耀祖·鄭華·德斯福·懷德好施·濮登青·浚鴻勛·羅魯·袁夢鴻·王貴循、趙拯·茅以昇·羅英兩委員會、除各分别開會外、並舉行聯席會議通過、工程處之設計、（除小部份之應修正者外）、並議决將本橋工程、分三部份包出、（一）正橋鋼梁（二）正橋橋墩（三）兩端引橋、其選標次序如下、</p>
<p>（一）正橋鋼梁—（一）道門郎公司、（二）西門子洋行、</p>
<p>（二）正橋橋墩—（一）　益洋行、（二）新亨營造廠、（三）寶利公司、</p>
<p>（三）兩端引橋—（一）東亞建築公司、（二）新亨營造廠、隨由工程處分别循序接洽、（一）各家之經騐、能力設備、與信用等關係甚鉅、須分别調查、藉明眞相、（二）各家標單有意義含渾者、須分别詢明、（三）各家建築方法不同、有須修正方能適用者、詢明其應增减之標價、（四）各家所報完工期限、有嫌太長者詢明其縮短之代價、（五）各家有自擬設計投報標價者、須覆核其内容、討論得失、經多次之探討、由處將各家情形、列表比較、呈請部省核示、分别商討合同、簽約施工、</p>
<p>（庚）工欵籌算</p>
<p>當本橋動議建造之初、羣以工程艱鉅、頗慮需費過甚、難期實現者、迨華德爾博士設計送到、估計共需七百五十八萬元、始有範圍可循、然如此鉅數、何從着手、嗣經橋工委員會調查國内市場情形、並將其設計内容、略予修改、重新估算、仍需五百十萬餘元、（連引橋接軌在内）按照當時市價、殆已無可再减、因根據此數籌欵、首由浙建廳商得導淮委員會同意、函請中英庚欵董事會息借料欵十六萬磅、復請全國經濟委員會撥借國幣一百萬元、一面由浙財廳　浙江興業、中國、交通、四明、及浙省實業五銀行息借二百萬元、均告成功、計共得五百五十萬元、足敷全部經費之用、繼鐵道部、以滬杭甬路借欵告成、可担本橋經費、因與浙江洽商、各認全橋經費之半、將籌欵辦法、重行支配、浙省仍以銀行借款爲資本、鐵道部則以中英銀公司及建設銀公司發行之滬杭甬路債劵爲資本、各認兩百萬元、餘俟需要時、再行籌措、按照此次招標結果、計正橋鋼梁一百三十餘萬元、（照最近匯兑價）、正橋橋墩一百五十餘萬元、兩岸引橋四十餘萬元、公路及鐵路路面二十餘萬元、約共三百六十餘萬元、（關税不在内）連同接軌及行政費等四百萬元、或足敷用、故工欵籌措、已無甚問題也、</p>
<p>（辛）工作程序</p>
<p>本橋工程、原定兩年完竣、嗣以浙贛路進展甚速、而滬杭甬路、急待完成、因與標商議定縮短工作時間、酌加工費、擬自開工日起、以一年半爲期、全部告竣、倘　辦到、則不僅橋梁收入、提前半載、借欵得以早清、即建橋之行政費用、亦因之减少、自屬最經濟之辦法、惟本橋關係重大、决不應重視時間、忽略工作、故承包廠家、須多備工具、各部同時興工、而工程處亦須加派監工人員晝夜勿懈、羣策羣力、方克有濟、其尤關重要者、則工作程序、必須就錢江情形、及工具設備、妥爲擬定、務期毋有參差得以全工無阻此項程度、已由工程處與包商研究甚詳、自開工日起、即將逐步實施、至明年六月時全部橋墩、均可動工、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　杯水見難求寒工護老　萬金談可致猾吏聯羣</p>
<p>車夫道：路步一半呢，你得加錢。李士廉道：加錢我就不要。説着，又是袖子一拂，竟自走了。在兩小時以後，李士廉滿頭是汗。鞋子上全是浮土，他可就回到小西天了。回到自己房間來時，早見同鄉郭敦品在院子裏同茶房説话，茶房道：來了來了。他回頭看到李士廉、高高舉手、連連作揖道：我早就算着你要來了，怎麽今日才到？剛才到財政廳去，見着廳長工没有？李士廉見院子裏人多，鼻子裏哼着，隨便答應了一聲。郭敦品上前握住他一隻手道：我在這裏，正苦着没有什麽朋友來往，你來了，那就好極了。茶房開了門、李士廉引着他進去，他還不曾坐下，就笑道：我今天來，雖是急於要看看你，可是也爲了急於要打你一個招呼。你什麽都不必去運動，想法子辦辦善後就是了。李士廉聽了這話，倒是一楞，爲什麽久别重逢，第一句話勸告我，就呌我辦後事，難道我們到西安來求差事的人，都有死罪嗎？取下帽子在手，正想向衣鈎上掛着，這倒掛去不够，縮回不得，作了一個姿勢，站在板壁下。郭敦品忽然省悟了，這是他有一種不通時務的誤會。便笑道：老兄，你要到陝西來辦税捐，連一些税捐名目，你也不打聽打聽嗎？這裏有一種説欵，呌善後捐，就是潼關以外的特税，特税是什麽税，你應該明白，用不着我來説了。李士廉這才把帽子掛上了，轉身向他笑道：你突然的呌我辦善後，我那裏會知道這些曲折，但不知詳細情形如何？請坐請坐，我正要請教一切呢。（六一）</p>
<h3>大學生宿舍</h3>
<p>— 孫育才</p>
<p>最近，我曾因爲拜訪幾位做大學生的朋友，在幾個大學校的學生宿舍裏光顧過，覺得大學生宿舍裏的佈置，具有一種相同的趨勢。</p>
<p>在粉白的墻壁上，我們看到一張十寸大或十二寸大的美術或彩色半身照片，挺刮的西裝，領帶是立體的垂在胸前，這就是這一間宿舍主人的玉照，在這一張照片四週，有不少的女性照片，大都是二八嬌娃，有半身的，有全身的，有坐着的，有立着的，服裝也是各式各樣的不同，但總是所謂最時髦，一九三四，三五，三六，年式，而且共同有一副迷人的笑容，那一雙秋波，好像在向我看着。</p>
<p>在電影，我是外行，電影女明星，除掉影后胡蝶，在照片上我還能勉强辨識外，其餘若阮玲玉，若袁美雲，我就無法識得，當我第一次看見這粉白的墻壁上有這許多摩登女士的玉影時，我還以爲這是這位朋友做了大學生以後結交的女友，或是女同學的照片，所以我開心的説：「老Ｋ！没得了，這許多女朋友我看你怎樣應付呢？」這一句就把我這位朋友笑倒了，他説：「還虧你在上海好多年電影也觀得不少，連幾位鼎鼎大名的女明星的照片都看不出來，這次記記好，以後不要再閙笑話了。」</p>
<p>我很奇怪，何來如此之多的照片呢？他説：這是甯波路一帶的照相館裏可以買到的：而且有不少的影院，在那裏舉行明星照片大贈送。</p>
<p>後來我在好幾隻大學的學生宿舍裏，同樣的看到這種情形。</p>
<p>這大概是大學生的審美觀念發達的象徵嗎？因爲明星都是美麗的，當然，這同日本學生宿舍裏，掛着東三省的地圖和風景片，是具有兩種風味的！</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （棲鳳樓主）</p>
<p>萬物起於點滴，已有人説過了，我現在再來談談，最光榮的一「點」，和最鄭重的一滴；</p>
<p>時科舉，考到殿試，皇帝在你的考卷上，御筆加上猩紅一點，你便是狀元，我想這「點」是最光榮的吧？</p>
<p>父子或母女，不幸自幼離散了，以後縱然遇見，難以辨認，祇有用滴血方法來解决，這鮮血一「滴」，當然最鄭重了。</p>
<h3>人海</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>我現在居住在人海的都市裏，於是我常常有些時候是走在人海中。</p>
<p>人海的景象是熱閙的！這些無量數的形形色色的人們：有穿着漂亮西裝的青年學生，有掛着徽章的商店職員，有歪戴小帽的外國水手，有挺着胸膛的西洋紳士，有挽着手臂的對對情侣，有塗脂抹粉的摩登小姐，有鳩形鵠面的襤褸乞丐，……這些人們表現着各種不同的姿態，忙碌的從铁面前掠過；我走在這樣一個複雜廣大的人海裏面，自己也顯得是渺小的了。</p>
<p>我眞的渺小得像是大海中一滴水珠嗎？（我問我自己。）在形式上，或者我可以承認；假使我更没有靈魂，没有理智，精神麻木，感情消失，那麽我簡直還不及大海中的一滴水珠：可是我並非那樣。我有熱情，我知努力，我要大步的跨過人類發展中的歷程。我要忠勇奮發的幹起超人的事業，我不能屈居在人海中做一個僅具形式的傀儡！</p>
<p>這就是説：假使我是大海中的一滴水珠，我也應當是屬於驚濤駭浪中的一滴水珠。</p>
<h3>老調又來了</h3>
<p>— 彤父</p>
<h3>縫窮婦</h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>氣候從温暖的空氣裏，漸漸轉到寒冷的綫條上，秋是深了—人們需要的棉衣，也就在這時添製，整理，預備，富人所製的是重裘，絲棉的衣服，窮人呢！只有整理舊衣裳，百衲襖，鶉雀衣，是他們唯一預防寒冷切身的恩物</p>
<p>在一個深秋的季節裏，是自食其力的縫窮婦生意最旺的季節，伊們拿着針綫包，或是提着綫籃，東街跑到西街，替人補綴衣服，整理舊衣裳，三個銅元，五個子兒的交易，伊們是做慣，不嫌生意的菲薄。</p>
<p>縫窮婦的主顧，是苦力，黄包車夫，這幾天因爲人家需要棉衣穿，縫窮婦的工作，大忙而特忙，貧民窟裏，草屋羣旁，東家搶到西家，零工整工，伊們眞是應接不暇，其實十個銅子整理一件破衣裳，貼針貼綫，還要找上四五小時的光陰，反不若一個補釘兩個子兒，來得劃算，省事。</p>
<p>社會經濟越困難，一般清貧孤苦的老婦人，越是没飯吃，伊們唯一的出路，是做縫窮婦，以解决目前生活問題，縫窮婦的産量，不論大都市裏，小村落裏，近年來越弄越多，伊們自己穿的破衣破服，却没工夫替自己縫補，專替人去補綫，東跑西轉，所得的工錢，肚裏仍是不飽，縫窮婦的痛苦，近來也感着搶飯盌，閙饑荒的困難伊們除去做這種事，却又另外謀不出其他的一條生路。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我瞧這些久已空閑着的宫院裏，差不多全已收拾得非常整齊潔净了，而且所有的一切點綴品，陳列品，也都安置得很適宜，太后見了是無疑的會滿意的。這些成績，便是那一批先期打發來的太監們所造就的；他們的人數也不多，日子又很局促，竟能有這樣出色的成績，倒是很教我佩服的。</p>
<p>太后在殿上觀看了一回之後，伊的第一個要求，就是午睡；午睡原是太后每天所不能少的工作，今天我們下車的時候，大約是十二點鐘，待我們鄭重其事的把這接駕典禮演完，已快打三句鐘，伊平常的午睡時間早已到了；就是伊自己没有表示，我們也必然會自動的去給伊凖備了。</p>
<p>盛京的宫院既已經過了這樣的一番收拾和佈置，當然也有很適當的寢宫，給太后端正下了；因此伊就表示要趕快到那新的寢宫裏去解决伊到奉天後的第一次午睡。伊這樣表示之後，我們這一起人，就得立即跟着變換一套動作了。原是一堆一堆地擠在一起的顔色，已漸漸地散將開去：那些佔最多數的太監，便各回原職，埋着頭，自去分别工作着；那政治犯式的光緒皇帝，本是不須服侍太后的，事實上他也不願服侍太后，太后也不要他服侍，所以待太后有了要午睡的表示，他也就帶着幾名太監，上他自己的寢宫中去了。他的寢宫便在太后的寢宫的旁邊，相距得很近，再過去一些，乃是他的妻子隆裕和瑾妃的寢宫。（一七一）</p>
<p>游踪所至</p>
<h3>寥天一雁</h3>
<p>— 厦千</p>
<p>我鄉黄厦千先生，任教北平清華大學，已届五年，本年得一學年之休假，並由學校供給費用，赴美研究　空氣象學，出發時遇之滬上，曾要其函告行踪，頃貽我一函，敘述華僑情况甚詳，擇要披露於此，或可供赴美者之參考歟？（寄萍附註）</p>
<p>舊金山華僑，在美國爲最多，歷史亦最悠久。此次見大批祖國青年前來留學，特舉行熱烈之歡迎會，饗以西餐及中餐，並導游舊金山全埠，盛意殷拳，殊可感荷，而近年華僑在舊金山情况，亦得藉以略知梗概矣。</p>
<p>舊金山華僑聚居之處曰唐人街，China　Town余在地理書中久已熟習其名，並常聞人言，唐人街污穢不堪，風氣亦甚壞，美國人每以化外視之，幾使余此次來美，不敢插足其間。迨既達唐人街後，徒覺此語不可信，雖大多商店，規模較小，而所謂污穢不堪與風氣敗壞者，迄未得有可資證明之事實。後乃聞華僑言，唐人街情形，在一九○六年前確不佳。一九○六年大地震後，房屋多重建，唐人街亦頓易舊觀，近年風氣所趨，華僑漸知自愛，街市情形，用愈有進步。然則所謂唐人街污穢不堪與夫風氣敗壞者，乃歷史上名詞，「士别三日，當刮目相看，」唐人街甯不可作如是觀。</p>
<p>舊金山華僑組織之嚴密，稱爲美國各地華僑冠，其最大之組織黨中華會館，英文名中華六省會館，Chinese　Six　Company以當一八四九年華人初到美洲時，僅有六者人也。今則省籍已遠超出此數，故六省會館，亦改稱爲中華會館，但美國人則仍沿稱之。其次團體，有中華美籍公民聯合會，Chinese　American　Citizen　Aliance（簡稱C.　A.　C.　A.）及數姓結合之團體，其中以劉關張趙四姓結合之「護國總公所」爲最雄厚，余曾往謁其辦事處，房屋甚佳，中供劉備關羽張飛趙雲像，畫工甚佳，四姓後人見之，回想其祖先當年聚義情形，當可增加若干團結力也。</p>
<p>舊金山華僑，據稱近數年來，觀念漸有變遷，以前頗多但得在美安居即不念鄉邦之人，今則殊不願離棄祖國，而以子女仍能在祖國立足爲榮。故頗注意於子女之教育，且中西並重，白日責其在美國學校受課，午後五至八時在華橋學校讀中文，有仍讀四書五經者。兒童在校情形，以余所見，體格多强健而活潑，殆久習於美國化歟？</p>
<p>舊金山華僑所辦之公益機關，有中華青年會·中華女子青年會·東華醫院·及學校多所·均頗可觀。其中男女青年會之便利往來僑胞，東華醫院之嫓美美國著名醫院，尤堪稱許。華文報紙，亦已刊行多種，曰少年中國晨報，曰國民日報，惜亦各自分屬於祖國之某派某系，有互相攻擊甚烈，涉及各系要人之私德，失言論界之風度者。倘美人而亦洞識中國文字，則今日在國内之黨國柱石，豈不將被其悮認爲一文不值。</p>
<p>唐人街中華僑所經營之各種商店均有，實可稱爲一獨立市鎮，其大要則屬於小本經營爲多。旅館類有共和旅館，Hotel　Republic大觀旅館，Grand　Veiw　Hotel新中國旅館New　China　Hotel等，價均不昂，最低者每日均美金半元左右，男女青年會亦可住宿，價相仿，酒飯館以「新上海」及「杏花樓」等爲最大，外人就食及往跳舞者甚多，「口之於味，」誠「有同嗜焉」</p>

<h3>猶太被擊片片碎東華八比一勝</h3>
<p>戴陳曹賈萬合作佳妙</p>
<p>猶太失常態攻守俱難</p>
<p>戰無不勝之東華、昨遇曾勝中華隊之猶太、在申園作甲組比賽、觀衆以李義臣被罰不能出場、前鋒缺一良將、進攻力量不無影響、且猶太前鋒驃悍活潑、兼而有之、是故未戰之前、觀衆彌不爲東華危也、庸知開戰之後、東華依仗其聯絡之純熟、射門之穩快、勢如破竹、上半時竟連得六球、下半時猶太雖能得洪光請客打破鴨蛋紀錄、但又被東華變本加厲增上二球、結果以八對一終場、是戰久稱東華本季之拿手傑作也、</p>
<p>戴中軍兩度立奇功</p>
<p>猶太開球向東進襲、三五回後、球落顧尚勷之手、轉入前鋒、曹秋亭突圍而入、戴麟經輔繼其後、哈斯坦半途解圍、曹再度問津、小萬及時趕到、短遞中路、戴中鋒以神化莫測之脚頭、搗破龍門、暴起四座彩聲、未旋踵、賈幼良翻翻滚滚、闖到敵人危險區域、高爾飛轉身不及、哈斯坦迎面撲到、賈幼良狡如山兔、足下翻花、麟經邁步而出、送球入門、</p>
<p>小派司賈馮雙告捷</p>
<p>猶太雖失二城、惡運未去、前鋒無法反攻、後衛動輒得咎、宫禁之地、遍見東華旗幟、五前鋒生龍活虎、泣鬼驚神、曹秋亭磅磚有丈夫氣概、高格兩番將、不在此公眼底、殺進殺出、如入無人之境、賈幼良伏兵一起、發腿射門、斜而且妙、直從左角彈入、迪却區驚魂未定、瞠目不知所措、洪光遥傳前方、哈斯坦與家球糾纏不已、格林勃躍起、頂成爲角球、萬矮虎挑送中心、大伯公遽放冷箭、成四對○之數　、</p>
<p>大屠殺火上又加油</p>
<p>猶太此時益見捉襟露肋、舉隊戰士、氣急汁喘、窘態畢露、尤以門神迪却區張皇失措、誤謬百出、小萬又開角球、家球禮讓爲國、戴院長却之不恭、抬起腿來、一掃而入、無何、高爾飛毛手毛脚、爲裁判發現、立判罰球、洪光隨意踢去、迪却區猶如驚弓之鳥、雖拍着而不路遠、顧尚勷從天而降、一撥即得、</p>
<p>請客人洪光做東道</p>
<p>休息之後、場外之猶太觀衆、無不呐喊加油、以勵士氣、場中人精神奮振、頗有作爲、幾度深入東華腹地、李甯大刀闊斧、殺人如麻、猶太累攻累潰、急切不能得手、焦灼情形、溢于眉宇、海雪克遥傳於東華門前、洪光躍起一頂、不料球不敵頭、反向網中逃去、猶太不血一刃、坐享一球、其喜可知、不移時S格林勃又來射門、凖而且急、距爲門柱彈回、亦祇有仰天長嘆、徒喚奈何、</p>
<p>八對一東華欣奏凱</p>
<p>雙方鏖戰良久、局勢平均、顧尚勷一軍起義、萬馬奔騰、曹陳賈三將擁護阿戴上台、其聲勢排山倒海、　不可當、「小曹瞞逼寫山陽表、」造成六對一、賈幼良意猶未滿、邊疆進窺、高爾飛有眼不識泰山、乃成引狼入室、陳家球津貼中軍糧草、萬象華受命舉義旗、門角落描凖一砲、猶太之門乃作第八次破焉、</p>

<h3>記「比蘭台羅」</h3>
<p>— 敬之</p>
<p>—本年諾貝爾文藝奬的得者</p>
<p>據本月八日的哈瓦斯電訊，本年的諾貝爾文學奬已經决定了哈與意大利的戲曲家並小説家比蘭台羅（Luigi　Pirandello）。</p>
<p>這一位作家的作品，在中國也有過相當的介紹。他是一八九七年生于西西里島，在波昂（Bonn）大學畢業，回本國後曾任羅馬女子高等師範學校的教授、同時從事文學創作。他的小説，詩，和劇本，數目很多，在他本國，他是個「風頭很健」的作家，他的著作銷行是很廣的。</p>
<p>比蘭台羅雖是個拉丁民族的作家，可是他在文學上却受了北歐文學的影響。有人説他全部的作品都表示了他所受斯德林褒格（Strindberg）的影響甚至比易卜生（Ibsen）的還多些。這話，當然是指比蘭台羅著作裏的悲觀厭世色彩而説的。</p>
<p>但是比蘭台羅根本上有和斯德林褒格不同的處所。斯德林褒格的悲觀思想是所謂「北歐式」的。他對於人生的終極是用了陰凄凄的悲觀的眼光去看的，然而他並不把「現實」看成毫無意義的一團混沌。比蘭台羅可不同。他的劇本和小説都使觀者感到什麽都是不穩定，都是一團糟，都是無意義，—他的作品裏的主人公幾乎全是些現代式的韓姆列德（Hainlet），什麽生活目的都没有。這些人物都是生活的中的敗軍；他們既不是深刻的人，也是什麽都鼓不勁來的人。他們對於生活的態度就好像一個什麽希望都没有的人蹲在一角冷冷地看着。他們怕想到將來，也無所謂對於現在的不滿足，他們覺得什麽都不能確定；在「已故的麥席阿斯·巴司喀爾」這一篇裏，主人公巴司喀爾説：「很少的幾件事裏有一件，也許只這一件，我是敢於確定的，這就是我呌做麥席阿斯·巴司喀爾。」但是到後來，這位巴司喀爾連自己呌做「麥席阿斯·巴司喀爾」這一點也不敢自信。</p>
<p>比蘭台羅的作品是這失却了任何自信力的舊世界的象徵！</p>
<p>在這裏，我們就要想到諾貝爾文學奬金委員會的既定宗旨是把這奬給與最好的理想主義的作家的。所以自來的暴露現實的自然主義以及舊寫實主義的作家幾乎没有一人得過奬的。但在今日要找「健全的積極的理想主義的作家」似乎頗不容易罷，所以這回的奬品只好給了悲觀懷疑的比蘭台羅。諾貝爾文藝奬委員會在每年一次不得不找個奬金的受者的時候，大概是異常「煩惱」的罷？然而不幸中之幸，總算還有比蘭台羅！</p>
<h3>辛克萊終於落選了</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>前幾月美國加拉福尼亞州知事候補豫選時，名聞世界的社會主義作家辛克萊氏，佔指名投票第一位而當選。此事立刻就轟傳世界。美國及各國的輿論，有些是説辛克萊已放棄他的社會主義主張，帮助羅斯福總統救美國的不景氣。但大多數刦是説辛克萊之出現政治舞臺，一方面是表示美國的同蘇聯復交後，美國的政治向左走的徵兆，一方面是表示羅斯福總統的傾向革命。因之這一派的輿論就拚命攻擊辛克萊的當選加州知事候補。辛克萊爲什麽會被選爲州知時候補呢？假使他當了州知事時，他將怎樣治加州呢？他發表了一篇宣言式的文章，説明他怎樣被選爲州知事候補及其將來治加州的兩年計劃。原文甚長，兹摘述其大要，並略加説明於下。</p>
<p>他首先説明他代代相傳都是民主主義者，他自己也是。他很贊成美國民主黨的創設者譚瑪斯，莎夫阿遜氏所説的：「人類並不是有多數人生來就有背脊負着鞍的命運，少數人生來就有合法地乘在那鞍上的命運」的話。他還希望這些話不僅是適用於政治，支配的分野，還能適用於商工業的分野就好。但以後的民主黨並没有執行創設者這樣的政綱，他就參加了新的時代的政黨——社會黨。他説他過了三十九年的文筆生涯，嘗盡了諸多苦楚，但他總願獻身於社會事業。曾三回投筆受加拉福尼亞州社會黨的推舉。兩回推舉爲州知事，一回推舉爲合衆國上議院議員。並曾得最高票數的六萬。他者，開始時是有民主黨的紳士寫信給他，勸他加入民主黨，並要求他答應推薦他爲一九三四年度民主黨的加拉福尼亞州知事候補者。又在一九三三年八月某夜，開過一個有五名民主黨的州議員出席的會議。在那會議上所討論的，就是要辛克萊參加民主黨，以他爲加州知事的黨候補。並且斯狄簧笙還説：「要是這樣，他一这下得民主黨的進步的部分，特别是青年們投票。就是進步的共和黨員恐怕爲着援助他而走到民主黨來者，也不下一○○，○○○名吧。」跟着他就説明他和一切善良的美國人一樣，是支持羅斯福總統的復興美國的N.R.A.　（籃鷹法）的。但他説其失敗是不可蒙蔽的。若依照政府搜集的材料，生産額不過達到一九二六年的水凖。就業者不過當時的七○％，賃銀則不過五○％。他確信在資本主義下，現在的失業者至少有一半再不能找到職業。因此他説假使他當選爲五十八個破産郡及一百個破産都市與城鎮的破産州知事，政治上台的第一根幹，就是給失業者以生産的工作，使他們自活。我們的新政治課題的第一條件，就是注意這個問題。人們的生命和福利是第一條件。我們不能不承認州中的人們佔有土地或密切接近土地，使其有生産手段的權利。我們所應該做的是使失業者回向土地（即歸農之意）。因此他提倡失業者的團居地。他從加州現有二種農業，他要提倡第三形式的農業。那就是由州之手創設由有訓練者所管理的團居地。在那裏建設勞働者的適當的家屋，共同廚房，輕便食堂，社交用的房屋等。使其在當初是保證生活，相當有成績時就保證安樂。使其能給加州一切失業男女以完全自活的機會。不但如此，他還説一切團居地要有圖書館，電影院，演講公共事業的主義的講堂，成爲文化的中心。假使我做了加州的州知事，就使一切男女，兒童不但有身體上的，還有知識上，道德上及審美上的自己教育的機會。及説我們必要有操縱團居地發展的公共會社及處理生産品的其他公共會社。必要洗衣館，麵包製造所，罐頭製造所，衣服，靴工場，士敏土工場，磚窰，木材製造所等。這與現世投機者榨取者毫無關係的。要建設新的失業者自己維持的世界的完全的職業組織。一切團居地要有賣工場生産品的店舖，一切工場要有廚房，輕便食堂及賣農産物的市場。這個組織必須有運工場生産品去團居地，運食料品去工場的搬運車。勞働者均以假證劵來買賣東西。他又提議加州發行十元美金的小額債劵，牠有低利，有的長期的，有的三十日的。使其實際上與公立貯蓄銀行是同樣的。債券作爲州通貨而使用。使民衆從私立銀行提出欵來交給州政府，爲發展州的産業組織而使用。他主張收入三千元以下的家庭全部免税，收入三千元至五千元者照普通率納税，每加五千元，加納一％之二分之一。收若收入一○○，○○○的家庭，須納一一％的税金。拒納者没收其住宅，用作收容孤兒，老人，或每日做十二小時的奴隸勞働而患肺病的人們的州設機關。</p>
<p>以上就是辛克萊自述他當選爲州知事候補的經過及其治加州兩年計劃的大概。按其中心内容，不外乎建立團居地。這團居地頗似蘇聯的集體農場。但蘇聯的集體農場之能神速發展是有其特殊的政治經濟組織爲後援。假定辛克萊眞能當選爲加州知事，在現在的美國，能否施行他這種計劃，仍成問題。若然，則他的簡單鬥爭口號：「杜絶加州的貧乏！」，將如二三年前轟動一時的「技術政治一一樣，只是口裏説説，紙上寫寫而已。</p>
<p>據最近的消息，辛克萊已被他的政敵麥里美Merriam擊敗了，辛氏無法獲得政權，他的政策，自然也無法實現了。</p>
<h3>「好喫船」</h3>
<p>— 尹光</p>
<p>我的一個愛説趣話的朋友，把這樣的船隻，呌做「好喫船」。</p>
<p>好喫船的外親，並不和普通的白木船有着顯著的差别。僅祇是中艙和後艙，是用木板和較厚的箴笆，裝置成了屋子的模樣。還在兩邊開了窗户，彷彿西湖里的大游艇似的。船身往往是很新色的，和剛纔下水的一樣。我幾乎從没見過一隻，因爲經過風雨的消磨，而顯着陳舊的灰褐色的。</p>
<p>在宜昌以上的幾處碼頭上，祇要那地方有着比較繁榮的市場，輪船一下椗，這好喫船，就要輪船尾巴上釘住了，幾乎神出鬼没似的。但也祇有停泊度的時候纔有，要是短時間的抛錨，便没有這類船隻的影子了。</p>
<p>「走呀？」到了夜靜的時候，一些長跑江湖的朋友，用下巴往上一點，便這樣地互相邀約着。於是兩三個一道，跋着拖鞋，拍—達，拍—達地走下廚房去，而從那裏，進到另一個小小的世界裏去了。</p>
<p>在船頭上，就照例地擺了爐灶，雜食擔子，酒，肉，和别的下酒菜，都是齊全的。中艙裏靠窗的兩面，各安置着兩張没有漆過的方桌。要是單祇喫一碗麵食，或者鷄蛋酒釀，或者喝一兩口「地窖」，便就在這裏停留下來了，不必再走進後艙去。</p>
<p>那里的門，是用門　遽住的。門幕以上的地方，總照例懸着一條小巧的木製積額，刊刻着「别有天」或者「世外桃源」這一類使人發笑的題字。但是走進來的客人，不管進不進那從稀薄的門幕，透出着誘人的光亮的密室一般的處所去，他們在未招呼食物以前，總要先把那帶點神秘性的布幕，用二指頭撥開一條縫，躬躬腰向里面瞅一眼，吸着鼻子説，「香呢。」然後纔退轉到桌子邊去。</p>
<p>這時「堂官」已經從船頭上踱進來了，站在桌邊，懶懶地拖下搭在肩頭上的抹布，問道：</p>
<p>「喝酒？」</p>
<p>「哎呀，您看，抹乾净來罷。」客人指了桌子上的油污，説。</p>
<p>有的單是爲壩補肚子來的，喫過一碗麵食，就用手掌抹着嘴巴回輪船去了。有的卻先要了茶來，很悠閒她喝着，彷彿是坐在岸上的茶舖里的一樣。直到把菜食慢慢地擺布好了，這纔從桌子上的一堆竹筷里，拿上五六支來，配揀着相稱的一隻。然後再討來草紙或者就把窗布扯下一搭，彷彿擦槍一般地打磨着食具。從他們，是看不出一點怱忙來的，有的祇是死氣和停滯，和煩人的囉唆。</p>
<p>這種來客，多半是私運商人，販賣手槍和烟土的流氓。酒食一完事，他們便又醉醺醺地打着「隔，」向堂官招呼説，「聽請清楚了麽？把茶端地來。」於是飄飄然地跨進後艙里去了。</p>
<p>這里面，就對面地安置着兩張粗燥的白木床。布置也很簡陋，祇有一層薄薄的稻草，一張草席，和一條藍布套子的舖蓋。枕頭已經很舊了，中間的一段凹陷着，恰如馬鞍一樣。白布枕套上，沾了泥污似的塗滿了頭油。</p>
<p>「南土嗎？」那個頭上勒着一條手帕的「打烟匠」，欠了身子，問。</p>
<p>「好……」客人回答着，向枕頭上横靠下去了。待到身體躺合適了。於是半閉了充血的眼睛，搔着大腿，用一種「喫膩了」的聲調嘟噥道：</p>
<p>「没有大袖子嗎？」（註）</p>
<p>「你正碰着我們這裏禁屠呢」。勒手帕的人笑着回答。</p>
<p>但是客人已經輕輕地打起鼾聲來了。</p>
<p>這種留連，多半是要到深夜纔完結的。來客不一定儘是抽烟，而且也不一定是「過癮」的。他們大都只是爲了無聊。在抽完一兩個小盒以後，他們便精神百倍地吹起牛來了。談的總是一些隱秘事件，屬於這一埠，這一段河面，或者就是這一隻停泊的輪船上的。而那範圍的廣大眞也　得上稱做淵博。</p>
<p>「呵，　的，……又討小老婆了？」</p>
<p>「就是那草棚裏紅眼老陳的女兒呀。她媽早些年就是一個爛貨……」</p>
<p>打烟匠做起歷史的分析來了。</p>
<p>但這裏，不管怎樣有趣，坐頭二等艙的客人，是絶對不來的。就是三等艙里較爲穿得周正的人，也甯肯卷臥在馬槽一般地舖位上，去咬嚼旅途的寂寞。然而，即使在這小小的世界裏，没有别的比較尊貴的面目了。不也儘够看出我們社會生活的斑麽！</p>
<p>註：凡吸烟的時候，是由女人當打烟匠的，通稱「大袖子烟。」這裏的「大袖子」，是指的女打烟匠。</p>
<h3>江湖客（四）</h3>
<p>— 蘆焚</p>
<p>他每年在這小城裏都有幾天逗留，而且幾乎是定規的，當杜鵑爲蓊鬱的夏天哭啞了嗓子，終於不得不帶着家眷逃荒之後，他應景出現了。是以這小城裏的孩子都認識了他，而追趕的喊着「香莩」。</p>
<p>他每年都落脚在那横街的小客店裏。這店的招牌老到記憶以上，因咸豐年間接待一位貴客，自今還和那貴客的事迹一道馳名。可是早也露出衰落氣象。自通火車，行旅間人再用不到過宿；兼之年來各處生意蕭條，就有幾個客倌也都住車站附近，大部率性停在堆棧裏。所以酒保兼小二在打過盹之後，縐縐眉心，還能想起這位老客前後落脚過八回，其中有一年爲打仗，老客將「香莩」全銷在别處。統計起來，自老客來到這城裏，已經有九個不幸的年挨過了。</p>
<p>他呌甚麽呢，那古怪的名字只有小二知道；然而也只是闢初二三年，過後都喊着「老客」或「香莩」，不久也就忘記了。</p>
<p>八月前後，小二從懶倦裏跳起，彷彿有聚「家小」的興頭，高聲宣嚷着：</p>
<p>「凖備着罷，「香莩」就來了哩——二鍋砲（即頂好的白乾酒）白燒。良心那良心！喎喎……」</p>
<p>他摹倣着出酒的樣子，滑稽使人捧腹，鼻頭的汗也冒出來了。於是他得意單伸出拇指，往上一舉：</p>
<p>「南海香莩……一隻雁！」</p>
<p>他委實高興，像等待一個老朋友。果然，不久「香莩」跟着第一隻雁來了。</p>
<p>「香莩」和别的「江湖」不同。</p>
<p>凡曉得江湖上情形的都知道，他們閑下來時就躲在僻處聚賭，彼此用盡心機，説着較親兄弟還親密的話。也就在這時候，將别人騙來的錢，以表面看去公正的方法再騙到手。談女人，誘引人家的媳婦，拚傢什。還有時間賸下來的話，就討論騙術或編法捉弄店東。也許只因爲一個人罷，他把所有賸餘時間都化在水邊。</p>

<h3>中國工業之病態</h3>
<p>— 趙晚屏</p>
<p>自從中國感受歐美列强經濟的壓迫，覺悟到自身工業建設的重要，一直到現在，也有好幾十年的歷史了。可是在這一段時期内，各種建設的企圖屢起屢仆，却始終不能在國内造成一個比較持久一點的，完全的，而且像樣的工業，這樣，我們眼看着有些工業，曾經一度繁榮了起來，不久却又花殘葉落似地衰倒下去了。許多近代式的工業，便乾脆無從建立起來，弱小無力的手工業，更不用説是接二連三地傾潰下去了。在這裏，我們忍不住要問，中國的工業究竟害着什麽樣的病症呢？</p>
<p>要是中國工業的不發達，是因爲牠害了病，那麽這一場病一定是一種疑難雜症，决不是普通的頭昏和傷風，可以用任何現成的藥，像凡拉蒙或阿斯匹　，來醫治的。因此，凡是對於救濟中國工業有興趣的人，一定不會否認，要救治中國目前工業的病害，非先把牠仔細診斷一下，明白牠底病源，再一步一步地着手開方下藥不可。</p>
<p>這一篇文章的意思，是想以作者平日觀察所得的印象，略爲提出一下，以供同好的研究。因爲只是印象，所以並不想在這裏下任何比　硬性的斷語，累贅的統計資料，自然也不是一定必要的了。</p>
<p>在平面所舉的各點之中，有些已經是大家口裏都唱過的常調了。可是我們却並不能因爲牠是常調，便忽略了牠底事實的存在。可是，在這裏，作者却很慚愧，他底學識是太不足了，如果他要執業行醫，那麽他至多也只能做到了個走江湖的行醫。</p>
<p>大概地説來，中國工業目前所遭受的災病，可以分成兩類：一種是外面的壓力，或稱外感：一種蚋在的缺陷，或稱内虚。</p>
<p>（一）外來的壓力</p>
<p>外來的壓力所加於中國工業的災害，是很明顯而普遍的，例如，我們所常舉的例子，在歐戰時，歐美各國都忙着從事戰爭，把他們手裏所抓住的遠東的經濟生命放鬆了，於是中國的各種工業，便突然地鬆動了起來，有着生氣了。就中尤其是棉紡織業，眞如脱羈之馬，遇着了千載一時的機會，蓬勃地發展着。可是，歐戰告終，和平恢復了，惡運又到了。因爲這時候，各國又都重整旗鼓，殺了進來，以圖恢復他們已失的市場。中國工業不是他們的對手，因此便節節失敗，損兵折將，竟到了今日潰不成軍的地步。外貨存國内市場的壓力，這是一個彰明較著的例案。</p>
<p>這種外來勢力的侵入，當以日本爲較急進。據本年九月二十四日新聞報所載消息，稱日本之東京，大阪，京都數大都市，有八十五個工業商品製造及推銷機關，决聯合以賤價在上海出售日貨，並擬隨時向内地發展。據最近報載，日本又設法在中國開日貨展覽會了。</p>
<p>在中國市場上，輿國貨最勢不兩立的，要算是日本的商品了。由歐美輸入的工業製造品，都是中國工業在現狀之下所不能生産的，不論是在技術上在經濟上，以及在生産的資料上。可是，日本的工業製造品却不同了，他們和我們一樣，很難希望有重工業的發展，因此，只能以輕工業爲努力的標凖來大量製造。他們人民的生活程度，和日常需要，又和我們相近似，所以他們底工業製造品，在合着我們的脾胃，這是歐美各國的工業所不及的地方。這樣，在許多地方，中日兩國的工業便常發生市場競爭的嚴重衝突，在我們救治中國工業的時候，我們也將以日本爲唯一的對象了。</p>
<p>前幾十年有一件很不幸的桎梏，使得國産工業品的銷路，蒙不利的限制，無力與外貿抗衡。這便是逢關過卡時所納的釐金，這幾年來，政府已經毅然决然地把釐金取消了，工業所佔的實惠眞不小。政府這種聰明的措施和忍痛的决心，是值得我們稱譽的，幾十年的秕政一旦取消，不是一件容易的事。</p>
<p>最近三年來，政府對外已總算取得了關税自主的權力了。在許多情形下，也儘量設法保護本國的工業。不過中國的工業還在幼穉時代，需要保護的情形比較迫切，需要保護的程度也比較深大，所以在許多情形之下，政府所定的税率還覺不足保護本國工業，我們不是説這件事只是政府一方面的責任。政府的保護税率的加高，不能不有一個限度，除非該項工業爲立國所必需的，政府還需顧到消費者的利益。例如，政府對於若干文化用紙之輸入，未嘗不可抽納重税，以保護本國之紙業。但是本國紙廠現在的設備，如以之生産該項文化用紙，其價格將　較舶來品爲高，這無疑是增加了文化所付的代價，而有阻滯文化發展的趨勢了。</p>
<p>此外，還有兩　困難的事，我們也得考慮的，第一是政府對外的地位，是否能容許她任意增加關税。第二是政府的收入多半來自關税，現在許多出口税都减低或免除了，要是再將外貨進口税增加到　無法輸入，那末政府方面　不是將損失一筆極大的税收嗎？</p>
<p>在國際市場上，中國的工業出品，也常受别國製造品的排擠。絲業和桐油業逐年輸出的减少，有一部份固然是由於世界一般購買力的跌落，其中也有一大部份却是由於消費國的自起製造，和他國貨品的競銷。</p>
<p>十幾年前，長江一帶輸出往歐美去的桐油，數量很大。因爲那時候市場的需要大，可是各國都不能够生産，近年來美國把桐子帶回去試植，結果很圓滿，雖然規模未必很大，可是中國桐油輸出的數量所受的影響，已經是很大的了。以後的結局究竟怎樣變出來，誰也不敢説。現在，不但美國試着栽植，便是日本也懷着野心，設法收買種子，在朝鮮境内做着初步的嘗試，以備將來能增加産量，把中國所有的市場奪去。</p>
<p>天津一帶所織的地毯，向來是以美國市場爲大主顧的。近來，美國也能設廠，用機器來製較粗的地毯了。對於輸入美國的地毯，加重抽進口税。這麽一來，在北平的許多織造粗製地毯的廠家，便失去了大部份的銷路，難以維持了。</p>
<p>不久以前，中國在洋群島也有較大的貿易的。到了現在有許多市場便多給日本貨槍估了。中國所出産的黄紙板，也曾一度銷售於南洋羣島，這一二年來，情形又大不相同了。日貨到處横衝直撞地攢營，國貨便没有能力來抵抗。</p>
<p>外來的壓力，有一部份雖不是中國工業本身的力量所能克服或抵抗的，不過我們也得承認，其中有一部份，却是由於牠自身的不健全，或是可以由自身的努力改進來挽救的。像絲，茶，及桐油的失敗，全是由於自己不長進，不肯學好。此外，有幾種新興的工業，如搪瓷業，熱水瓶製造業等，確曾因國人的努力而將外貨摒出境外，即向來以美觀賤價取勝的日貨，也只得退避三舍。這裏便表現出中國工業的眞正的能力。如果能善事應付，那末外貨的壓迫雖緊，也不足致我們於死地啊！</p>
<p>因此，要抵制外貨的競爭，除了政治的力量以外，還在工業界自己來打出路，像出品的改良，成本的减輕，造成一種愛用國貨的國民風氣，和各廠家的聯合來增厚實力。最近一二年中，國産廠商亦頗能自知振作，各種國貨運動非常活躍，並不時向内地去推展，這種情形以前是没有的，不能不説是一個良好的進步的現象。</p>
<p>（二）内在的缺陷</p>
<p>Ａ　經濟的　資本的缺乏是阻礙中國工業發展的最大的致命傷。這是因爲中國本來已經是一個貧民充斥的國家，而這些貧民又從來不知道怎樣把他們所有的那些可憐的本錢，利用到生産的路上去。因此，能够跑到金融市場來，作産業資本或調劑工業需要的現金便很有限。工業的周轉和活動，也就到處受到拘掣了。</p>
<p>因爲中國産業的不安定，銀行對於牠們底放欵，常採取謹填而嚴格的手段。有些保守和持重的銀行，便乾脆不肯做工業的放欵，甚至眼看一個工業因此倒下去，却依然見危不救。這一件事，使得工業在需要借欵緊迫的時候，倍感痛苦。金融界和工業界應彼此互相帮助，共同打通一條路，是現在最切要解决的問題。</p>
<p>國際匯兑率的漲落，也是大有影響於中國的工業的。像較近銀的匯價漲高的時候，不但外國的貨物可以有門徑侵入中國市場，打破中國工業原來的陣營，同時若干有輸出貿易的工業，却有失去原來市場的危險。匯兑率同樣也能影響别的國家；可是他們工業的勢力雄厚，能够暫時忍受匯兑率變動所遭的損失。中国或的工業，根基脆弱，那裏能吃得消呢！自然站不住脚了。還有一層，中國在國際債務或其他問題上，没有多少地位，處處都是被動的。他國可以自由操縱國際匯兑率，俾有益本國，我們却只能忍氣吞聲地吃受下去。像這樣的損失，便是中國所特有的了。</p>
<p>中國不能把她所有的工業都用來供給國内的消費，同時她又需要許多外來的貨物之輸入，那末她不能不有相當的貨品之輸出，來彌補國際間的一批債務。輸出的産物如果是中國所特有的，那便没有問題了。要不然，嚴重的困難便要臨上頭了。</p>
<p>中國没有直駛外洋的自有航輪，即以最近的日本和南洋羣　來説，也没有一艘本國的航輪。要是國産工廠有製造品要運到南洋羣島去，勢必裝在他國的船上，如日本及荷蘭公司的商船。這樣，他們可以隨意操縱運貨的水脚費，而中國廠商决無法和他對付。假如有一批貨物要裝運日本的輪船到南洋去，而這種貨物却是和日本的出品有競爭的可能的，那末聰明而愛國的日本輪船公司的主人，便會要索極高的水脚費，使中國廠商增加一重極苦痛的負担，同時對於所載的日貨，則欣然地予以拆减的水脚，並給以許多裝缷時的便利。很可能的，這一批日貨也許會和中國貨裝在同一隻船上的。中國的貨物既然遭受了這樣的磨折，那末到了南洋以後兩國貨物競爭的能力，是顯而易見的了。</p>
<p>Ｂ　技術的　技術人才的缺乏，是使關心中國工業問題的人很担憂的一件事。這多半是由於僱傭制度的不良。有許多人學成了，却懷才不遇，有許多人要想得有訓練的人才，却不知往那裏去要。所以我們常看見許多新式的工廠，他們所雇用着的技師或工程管理員，都只是有經騐的工人，而不是受過高等技術教育的人物。他們底經騐無疑地是粗淺和陳舊的，他們决不會有高深的知識的造就的。這種樣的人，在道德上，是很危險的，在學識上，是很欠缺的。以他們來維持故有的局面，容或可行，要希望他們能發展或改進事業，則深嘆不足。以這樣的工業，和經騐更爲豐富，學識遠見優勝的外國工業去競爭，勝敗之數，雖穉子亦能道之也。所以人才缺乏這一點，可以説是阻撓中國工業發展的大障礙，這一個障礙不除，中國工業將永遠是在停滯中，在死氣沉沉的破滅中。</p>
<p>中國工廠中，對於經營工場一層，似乎全没有注意到。他們很少會低頭去想一下，那一部份的工作是不必要的，可以减少了以節省成本的。那一部份的工作現在在感不足，非增加不足以使生産力充量發展。換句話説，他們很少知道如何利用「工作效率」這樣東西的。</p>
<p>僱工的制度，也大有可以改進的地方，包工制很顯然地是一個原始的，不經濟的辦法。廠方給付和普通工人一樣的工資，而工人所還報的工作，却無疑地是低於普通工人，因爲包工的工人，和廠方並没有直接的接觸，不會發生濃厚的感情的，同時，他們底工資的一部份既被包工頭所侵佔，他們實得的工資便很少，自然不會誠心悦意地作工了。</p>
<p>僱用私人是中國社會中普遍的習慣，在工業中也是免不掉此種傳播。我們每次搭乘中國公司的輪船，總免不掉要奇怪，爲什麽在船頭的甲板上，會擠滿了那麽許多莫明其妙的人，在那裏高談闊論。他們顯然是爲公司所僱在船上服役的，可是船上依然是那麽混雜和膩髒，他們却毫無所睹地閒着。我們每次總要驚異，公司方面怎樣能維持那麽多的人呢？可是在日本的船上，情形便全然兩樣了，所僱的人手雖不多，却總是一天到夜的刷洗和工作着，務使全船保持整潔和美觀，這兩者相差的地方，實在是太大了。同一的情形似不難見於其他的工業，這樣，不用説是增加了中國工業以甚大之負担。</p>
<p>在工場的組織方面，也常有許多不幸的缺點。中國企業家的眼光短小，往往只看到目前，是一個極大的弊病。</p>
<p>例如有一家廠要開辦了，他所有的資本僅够買兩架機器，那末他便只買了兩架，放置機器的地位，也剛够兩架之用，此外他便全不在意。以後事業發達了，他便再抽出些資本來購買機器。這時説不定人手已經換過了，或是其他所有可能的原因，所買的機器未必和以前的是同一種出品或是同種性質的機器。也許以前所買的是柴油引擎，而這次却是蒸汽發動機，我們也曾發見此種情形過。有時甚至在一個過程中，包括許多國家所製的各殊的機器。擱置機器的地位，既没有預籌，自然只好臨時再闢天下了。</p>
<p>這樣，工作的效率便很差，生簅的减加並不能减輕成本費用，因爲牠們並不能成爲一個整系的生産單位。</p>
<p>由於上述情形，我們乃常常碰到很離奇的現象。在若干工廠中，不無優良的機器設備，而經營者却是毫無學識及能力的人。若干工廠中，經營者的學識和能力頗有可取，却受制於破舊的機器，難圖抒展，在這畸形的狀况之下，中國工業所受的損失，眞難以數計。</p>
<p>心理的　中國的企業家之眼光不大，已經是大家公認的事實了。他們只想顧全目前的利益，對於未來的結果是很少留意的，而且他們也没有能力來作任何的預測。他們常常缺乏一種企業家所應有的，正當的，試探的，和前進的心理。要是他們很幸運地賺了錢，他們大都便畏縮不前了。因此，中國的各種工業便很難期其有大規模地發展了。</p>
<p>他們還有一種可恥的習性，便是墨守成規，秘而不宣。偶然得了些一知半解的東西，他們便諱莫如深，以爲自己的方法，乃係成功的唯一法門；手工業之以祖傳秘訣等等招牌來號召，且不去管牠，即在新式工業中，亦有此種現象，實在是很可嘆惜的。同時社會一般的心理，也多以祖傳和老牌爲貴，不務新奇與進步，於是别人嶄新而出奇的東西已經出來了，他們還是閉着眼睛，蒙着耳朶，捧起祖傳的招傳來自重　這種態度的結局，對人是在當時「秘法」無傳，事業不能普遍發展，對已是頑固不變，自甘落後。</p>
<p>墨守成規，不但是個人的心理的特點，也是中國舊式的經濟組織所自然造成的。中國故有的工業，都是些手工業。這種工業的成功，大半在手手藝的技巧。所以工人的工資普通多是很高的，至少是高於那些祖技工人的。如果工場的主人要一下子解散原有的工場而另起爐灶地，再立一個完全新式的工廠，那便什麽問題也没有。假如他底力量不容許他這樣做，他只能逐步地設法改良，那他便會遭受一種强有力的阻力，即工人的反對。生産過程現代化的換一方面，是生産過程的簡單化。這種改革一下實行，技工的身價便會大跌，他們或是被迫退　，或是忍受與粗工同等的待遇，這不是他們所堪的，生産方法的改良也許會增加他們底工作份量，這樣，如果工資不同樣地也增加，也是要被他們積極地或消極地反對的；工業的進步便大受横阻。</p>
<p>中國的企業家還有一種毛病，便是，只要有利可圖，大家便趨之若鶩，全不顧到大局。例如，在近幾年，電木業很能博利，大家便都撞上一條路來了。結果生産過多，彼此不惜拚命地抛價競銷，弄成額破血流的情景。六七年前，黄紙板業也差能謀利，於是大家都起來設廠製造，一時竟有六家紙板廠之多。以中國的市場，怎能推銷那麽多量的出品呢？不顧死活的競爭的結果，是兩敗俱傷，虧本的虧本，倒閉的倒閉。到了現在大家纔覺悟了互相聯合起來，也已經大錯鑄成了。到兩洋羣島去推銷，有日本貨爲敵，没有辦法，只好彼此約定以輪流停工來减少屯積。橡膠業在二三年前眞是風行一時，誰個眼見了不眼紅。其時上海一地，便有四十八家工廠，所製的出品彼此都是一樣，那時誰會想到有今日之慘敗。此外以同樣的原因失敗的工業很多，如搪磁業，電泡業等。</p>
<p>中國工業所吃的似此的虧，不知有多少。差不多每一種新興的工業，都有這樣的現象。由這種現象，我們看出了兩點事業：第一，中國現在已經有一部份資本要跑到工業的用途上來了，可是牠們摸不着頭，不知道走那一條路好。第二，企業家的惟利是圖，對於市場需給的情形却又漠然不知。他們從没有想到，他們底出貨加入市場以後，會發生怎樣的影響的。</p>
<p>關於這一點，瑞典的製造商便聰敏得多了。據錢承緒博士歐遊考察所得的，該國每同一種類的商品，在同一地製造的，絶不多見。其原則即在防止同業競爭，藉以維持貨價。他們從來不作無計謀粗製濫造，有時甚至避免與外貨競爭的犧牲，以本國所有的資本用在其他生利的事業上。</p>
<p>我們認爲中國現在確有一部份資本，想到工業上來活動，却苦於没有確實的知識。現在我們所需要的是，如何纔能想出一個辦法，來指導這些没有着落的資本，使牠們走入牠們所要走的路，發展牠們最大的效用，並隨時供給他們以市場情况的知識。</p>
<p>自然的　中國工業的發展，還有一個最根本的困難，便是基本原料的缺乏。重工業方面的原料，像煤和鐵兩種，據北平地質調查所近年調查所得的估計，所有的全國産量，不但没有以前所傳的那麽多得驚人，而且品質也多半是很壞的，不合工業上精良的用途。其他鑛産原料之缺乏，也是十分明顯的。</p>
<p>農産原料之不足及缺乏，是幾乎使人難以置信的。中國是一個農業的國家，依普通人的見解，一定以爲這種原料大可不愁。事實上却大謬不然！中國農民所耕植的幾全部爲穀物及雜糧所佔，工業上所需的重要項目如森林等，竟是貧乏得可憐。</p>
<p>據工商半日刊三卷二十二期所載，本國不能出産之原料，計有細棉紗人造絲，以及其他合用之原料，有硝石，陶工等十六種；本國生産價格高於舶來品之原料，有呢帽坯，柏油，及白蠟三種；本國前産而來源已絶之原料，有紫梗等。這裏所包括的恐怕只是見於國際貿易的項目上的，其不能包括一切，自　不成疑問。以後工業逐漸發達，原料所需的數量及種類俱增的時候，這種情形將更爲顯著。</p>
<p>由於這些自然所加的限制，中國的工業便如患着先天不足之症，非靠外來的原料供給，不能立足。中國没有殖民地及海外屬地，這些原料的來源，勢必仰求於其他國家。在這一點上，我們不難看出中國工業的危險來。牠底生殺之權，將完全操在别國人的手裏。道是一個如何嚴重的問題啊！</p>
<p>如果我們有心要發展中國的工業，那末這種原料的問題，即工業的食糧問題，非先加以解决不可。不過這種努力，是有一個限度的。除非去掠奪别人的土地，鑛産原料是人力所不能够大量製造的，要是自然的賦予是十分貧瘠。農産原料所受的限制雖不少如鑛産的那麽嚴厲，不過有許多植物是受土壤及氣候的限制的。只有化學品原料，人爲的努力尚能得到較大的效果。小規模的化學工業社在中國總算已有好幾家了。前二三年，大家有橡膠原料化工廠之發起，化學界，亦曾有人創設國貨原料研究會，目的即在促進各界採用或改良本國的原料。最近流酸鍾廠及酒精廠，亦正在大規模地籌設中，可見國人方在努力克服原料問題之困難也。</p>

<h3>從贛南新復匪品中之救護工作談到公家施診制（三）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周先生講　陳生白　江晦鳴筆記</p>
<p>（丙）醫藥人才不妨用多級制的討論</p>
<p>這次我和盧致德先生晤談，使得我的思想上也起了絶大的轉變。盧先生他的出身是在貴族化的恊和醫學院，過得優美的環境，在我們的理想中，將以爲他的思想行爲，也許要受都市物質文明的支配、或者以都市爲目標—這是中國人傳統的觀念、一般留學回來的學者，差不多都覺得在中國物質享受的不足——可是這位盧先生，他雖然是一位嶄新的人物，而他這次和我談論的醫藥問題的見地，完全没有貴族崇高的思想，可以説完全和我一致。因爲我的意思，正是想我們要離開了都市的背景，深入民間，絶對不可拏在都市的眼光，去看遍一切。法律隨各處風俗人情而有差異，醫藥也應該如此，尤其是中國的醫藥，要應時制宜，纔有辦法。現在且把盧先生的對於醫才採用多級制的理論，重複的再介紹一下。</p>
<p>盧先生説：「我們要想普及科學的醫藥，而使它深入民間，我們應當從鄉村醫院的建設着手。至於怎樣才可以使鄉村醫院成功呢？那麽就應該把眼光放眼，從國民經濟的力量上來打算。中國的醫才的分配，應積極採用多級制，就是看護出身的人才，也不妨用在鄉村操理醫病的技業」。我們想：盧先生大約是感覺到中國的醫藥人才是不够支配了。所以他道如此説，像我這次從上海帶去的護士，他們的技能，不僅爲鄉村間所缺乏，更爲内地各小縣各鎮所絶對的需要者。</p>
<p>説到這裏，順便再講一段關於舊醫的事情。在鄉間不但感覺到新醫的缺乏，就連舊醫也竟都缺乏，窮鄉僻壤簡直就無舊醫可尋。這次我到南昌車站的時候，爲了好奇心的驅使，曾經到一片中藥舖裏去調查。發現到該藥舖裏竟祇有三十幾樣的飲片，和七八樣丸散。瞧瞧：中國内地的醫藥是怎樣的簡陋。所以我認爲眞正要談到全國的醫藥問題，向來上海報紙上新舊醫藥的筆墨官司，可以説簡直没有搔首癢處哩。不過我在這裏所要聲明的，就是醫藥的普及，一定要根據科學的思想，科學的方法，和科學的學識去前進，這是絶對不能够動摇的。尤其是中國的科學醫藥的普及，更不是一定要拿都市做背景，和唱物質高調，方可實行的。</p>
<p>（丁）國家施診的動議</p>
<p>然而，從上面的統計中，我們應該認識的，就是它的範圍内，不僅包含門診的施診，而兼有住院的病人。而所診治的科目，也包括到（一）外科大手術四十二次。（二）軍事普通外科。（三）内科與皮膚各科（四）傳染病。（五）流行病等。至於包括的區域與性質，也各個不同，而且不局於一隅。如（一）匪區，（二）水災區域，（三）都市，（四）商埠附近。而地帶亘達杭州，上海，江西省，浦東等地。所用去的藥品中，如（一）高價的血清，譬如像赤痢血清，每次有用一百六十C.C.。</p>
<p>由上面的講述，我們知道江西河南等省的醫藥，都還没有像樣：試想：那荒歉連年的甘陝，也就不言可喻了。如此看來，整個的中國醫藥，如要找出路，一定非要辦到公醫制不爲功，而公醫制的萌芽，先要從新醫施診所去做起。不秘急急乎談大醫院。但新醫的施診所，則不妨先從富庶的省縣先創辦。如今且拿我個人歷年來辦各地公益醫院的經騐，統計出一些數目字來，看公醫制的可能性如何：</p>
<p>（一）最近據由上海地方恊會派赴南昌担任救護工作的報告，在最近兩個月中，共診病人一六四二七號，以後大致有增無减。統計在五個月中，要診四一一○○號。但經費只有八千元已足够用。平均每個病人代價，約爲二角左右。不過在我覺得，甚不經濟。這種不經濟的原因，約略如下。第一爲了路遠的盤費。第二是行裝的置備，第三器具的重新購置。第四往往因急於應用，故藥品不能用原料，而用比較高貴的丸劑。第五爲了短時期的聘用醫師，當然代價是要較高的薪水。我們看，上面已經説過，病人每人平均的代價計爲二角，在這個數目廟，分析地説，平均醫師的薪水，就要佔去一角二分五厘，實際上病人的藥費，實祗合到七分二厘。</p>
<p>（二）再將本人兩年中經手所辦的公益醫務九次，來平均統計一下。如川南五縣水災，廣昌，濟羣醫院，急救時疫醫院，洋涇醫院，高行醫院，浦東醫院，杭州時疫醫院，傷兵醫院等，計診病人號數爲二十二萬五千四百三十二人。而所用出的欵項，共爲九萬○七百○九元。平均每個病人代價爲四角○二厘，這數目似乎狠貴。</p>
<h3>徵求各地衛生醫藥狀况</h3>
<p>本刊創辦以來，瞬將兩載，平素以創倡新醫，促進全國衛生爲己任；惟是同人等才識有限，見聞不週，時虞隕越。兹特敬請各地人士賜予贊助，期於全國醫藥衛生方面，多所推進，無論公家報告，私人調查，均所歡迎。材料務期。材料務期正確，報告務期詳盡：一經收到，當即刊載，另具薄酬，以答雅意，謹此啟事。</p>

<h3>一個關於軍醫的希望</h3>
<p>— 李康年</p>
<p>編者先生：因爲連年在匪區裏參加勦匪工作，事實上的限制，和我每天要見面的老朋友—申報—是隔閡了許多時候了。這數月來的生活安定了些，而且移到這保定比較大的城市來住了，方纔再和我的老朋友恢復了舊交。在老朋友這裏，知道你們是含辛茹苦的爲公衆衛生事業在努力服務着，眞呌我萬分感謝的。</p>
<p>下面這個短篇，是鄙人數年來實地的經騐，覺得非常重要的，所以把它寫出了，請你能分一點寶貴的編幅給它吧—這對於軍醫事業的發展上，多少是有益的，而且成千成萬的非正式醫校出身的軍醫人員都很感激你的—爲了你們給他訴出苦哀與希望。即此敬祝努力！</p>
<p>在我們中國的都市裏，十數年來醫藥衛生事業，實在是有長足的進步了，但是在農村和軍隊的這面。當局雖不斷地圖發展，爲了人才和經濟的限制，離開水平線還是很遠的。</p>
<p>民國以來，國内陸續發生着内憂外患，無時不陷於戰爭的狀態中，於是軍隊的人數也隨着非常驚人地增加了，軍隊的醫藥衛生事業也跟着發生缺乏人才的恐慌了，本文想談的便是關於軍醫這方面的幾句話和一個希望</p>
<p>「富軍需，窮書記，副官拍馬屁，刁兒浪蕩幹軍醫，」這是軍隊中普遍地流行着的而又極其切實的諺語；在這裏我們便可以想像出軍醫人員在軍隊中是如何的樣子，是如何的使人看不起。</p>
<p>本來醫藥學是最高深的科學，做醫生的人是有高深的學問和高尚的人格的，那能够被稱爲「刁兒浪蕩」呢？這就是一般軍醫人員大多是濫竽充數的緣故，他們的出身大半是非正式醫校，他們只稍爲知道一點普通醫藥知識，他們診治病人的方式是馬得會呌人發笑的；所以「刁兒浪蕩」四字放置在軍醫人員頭上是極其切當的，就是軍醫人員自己，有的也居然承認他們是「刁兒浪蕩」的，在他們同行業的談話中，時常可以發見。</p>
<p>目今世界各大國，隨着科學的昌明，軍隊的醫藥衛生事業都在日新月異地猛進着，獨我們中國是操縱在這班「刁兒浪蕩」的人手裏，這實在是個嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>這問題，當局早已覺悟了的，所以除了軍醫學校擴充以外，還有軍醫學校補習班的設置，聽説每二年招一班，每班四十人，以每師保送二人入學；這是補救濫竽充數軍醫人員的至善辦法，不過中國現在的師已有一百數十師之多了，在這一百多師的軍醫人員當中，雖無確實的統計，但這種濫竽充數的佔大多數是無疑的。像這樣的辦法，可説是杯水車薪，效力欠少了—爲軍隊的醫藥衛生事業前途設想，我希望，當局能擴大補習班，至少在三五年以内，使全國濫竽充數，非正式醫校出身的軍醫人員有深造的機會。在這些軍醫人員中，有少數雖是不可救藥的了，他們不求上進，自以爲這點程度是够了；但多數是想求深造的，他們有豐富的經騐，他們時刻在求上進，只是苦於無門可入，當局正可以利用他們的這點長處來造就他們。</p>
<p>這個希望是普通的，平常的，然而是十分緊要的。</p>
<h3>今日之禁娼問題（下）</h3>
<p>— 「卻」寄自南京</p>
<p>私娼充斥，其影響於社會者殊劇，</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>兹舉其犖犖大者，約有三大點，（一）爲花柳病蔓延，不易防範，因私娼之秘密賣淫不知注意清潔與預防，鴇母惟利是圖，更不顧一切，致花柳病之猖獗，不可抑止，觀乎中央等醫院及本市各診療所主治花柳科人數之日見增加，即爲鐵證，（二）爲販賣人口，社會對於娼妓既急切需要，則視爲利藪者，自應時而具，於是慘極人生，違背人道之活劇，遂層出不窮，女子形同貨産，展轉買賣，全失自由，即所許營業之歌女，大多數又何莫不由販賣而來，罔論其他，（三）爲影響治安，因私娼之充斥而易滋宵小匪徒之混跡，且因販賣人口等等種因造成種種無勢力及黑幕，均可直接或間接碍及地方之治安。</p>
<p>關於救濟之策，吾人不願以提高女權，設立大工廠等等空泛動聽之言詞，向社會頻唱高調，按照上述情形，已得下列之結論，爲根本救濟之唯一無二辦法計有三大點，一爲管理花柳病：二爲嚴禁販賣人口：三普及教育：此三則如能做到，則娼妓可不标而自絶，名祇以「禁娼」二字，高唱入雲，不謀根本之策，則欲求實現，殆如痴人説夢，今并舉三項辦法，概略説明：（甲）關於管理花柳病者，一爲檢騐娼妓，有臨床檢騐，顯微鏡檢騐，血清檢騐，等項，即屬一一行之，以取精確，但實行之際，每一娼妓假如每十日檢騐一次，每月中其餘廿七日仍在傳染危險之中，苛言之或僅在檢騐時之一刹那，可保持其現狀耳，故其效極微，科學醫學雖日益進步，亦决不能一見面即能知其人有無毒菌，如某某市檢騐娼妓僅按脈，有眼，摸手心以定染毒與否，此事眞是欺人自欺，檢騐之手續，既如此複雜繁重，專恃爲管理花柳病之工具，更屬不可，若不與下列諸法併行，不足以言收效也（二）爲預防治療，最爲有效，且手續簡便，祇須在未性交前及已性交後施以相當預防方法，以避傳染，（三）爲早期治療，如不幸受有傳染，即應從速診治勿使延擱，致失治療機會，（四）爲免費治療，此則極爲重要，蓋凡身染毒菌後，以梅毒打針計必須三四十針方可治療，每針以五元計算，其數已屬可觀，試問以金錢爲唯一目的之鴇母豈肯出此鉅欵，以爲其不關痛癢之人治病耶？（五）爲避孕，此事亦應提倡，蓋藉以避免梅毒遺傳之兒女，以影響民族健康，一面并必須施以教育，使有性的常識，以爲防患未然之需，（乙）嚴禁販賣人口，取締老鴇制度，老鴇之毒害，罄竹難書，爲造成萬惡摧殘女性之大罪人，祇知圖飽私衆，不顧他人疾苦，即妓女已罹疾病亦絶不寛貸，仍令强迫接客，稍有不遂，則鞭撻立至，蓋老鴇之視妓女爲摇錢樹，决不甘放棄其利益，故妓女之火坑地獄，老鴇爲直接造成者，絶難粉飾，欲達禁娼之眞實目的以拯救女性，勢非禁止嚴厲販賣人口，取締老鴇制度不可，據吾人之調查，妓女之來歷，十分之九係販賣而來，販賣之原因，雖有誘拐有父母迫於生計者而其以自身利害，或情甘墮落者，究居少數，災區難民，未經老鴇之訓練，一躣而爲都市之娼妓者，實未見之也，販賣人口非僅爲女子墜入火坑地獄之階叚，而因此復産生種種惡勢力，以影響地方安甯亦復不少，故必須嚴厲禁止，如有所獲，宜繩以極刑，使知警戒，（丙）普及教育，普及教育，即提高生産，此爲社會上普遍問題，此間可不必細述，總之娼妓問題，關係社會者甚大，决非高懸禁娼招牌，所可解决者，此外妓女之婚嫁，亦須加以注意，愚以爲必須經過官廳所訂之法定手續，藉以避免第二次或第三次之販賣也。</p>
<h3>從體仁醫院談到租界上中外待遇之不平等</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>體仁醫院位於法租界之巨籟達路，蓋一慈善性質之醫院也。自余長院以來，即從事於内部之整理。惟至今引爲遺憾者，即門首之菜市無法驅移之也。</p>
<p>醫院以清潔爲條件，而外表之觀瞻亦至有關焉，今則門首之菜攤林立，至使交通爲之阻塞，腥穢因而雜聞。來院者每生不快之感，住院者時聞喧囂之聲；職是之故，吾人之於租界當局，如法公董局，如納税華人會，皆曾爲大聲之呼籲矣—無如言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，理雖足，而不能動其聽，情雖至而不能感其心；豈有鐵石之心腸，决非言辭所可感動者耶？此無他，中外待遇之不平衡而已！</p>
<p>同一醫院也，而中外所立待遇不同，外人所立者，無論其爲正式，爲江湖，爲慈善，爲營業，凡足以壯其觀瞻而增其利益者，租界當局無不盡力以爲之謀也。吾人試觀外立醫院之門首，有菜攤攤立之現象乎？一車之置，不在其位而警察且加以干涉焉。而况其他。今乃於華人所立之醫院，任其湫雜而不爲之謀，聽其呼籲而不加過問。夫租界之大權，操於外人之手，其爲歧視，尚非無故。獨所謂納税華人會者，係租界上華人之集團，爲華人謀幸福者也。而亦置若罔聞，深爲不解。</p>
<p>不僅此也，租界上之所表示者，無一非不平等待遇之現象也。同一租界區域，外人居者則馬路之修治，不絶於目，衛生之設備，惟恐不周，華人居者則亂石之路，行者崎嶇，塵穢之狀，見者礙目，試問華人所納之税，果少於外人乎？所盡之義務同，而所享之權利則判若天地，天下不平之事，甯過於此乎？</p>
<p>尤有進者，工部局對於外立醫院，無論其爲是否慈善性質，或是否爲正式醫院，往往不吝施捨，加以津貼，如上海某某外立療養院等皆是也。若爲華人所立，即其性質爲純粹慈善，而工部局亦殊尠施以津貼者，豈慈善之事業亦有中外之分耶？此租界之所以爲次殖民地也。</p>
<p>今者體仁醫院不幸而爲華人之所辦，又不幸而位於華人區域之中。於是門首菜攤，租界當局一紙公文即可令其遷移者，乃亦靳而不發。此其視華人爲化外，可斷言矣，余於斯事，前曾發爲二文，載於報端，此爲第三次之呼籲矣。今者醫院門首以修路之故，而菜攤暫移他處矣。是可見遷移非絶不可能之事，公董局是否乘機禁其再回，以爲亡羊補牢之計，予將拭目俟之矣。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問題</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（四十四）胃酸過多症</p>
<p>（問）胃酸過多症的原因是什麽？</p>
<p>（答）這是神經障碍的一分症，也有獨立發現的。中年的人很多。</p>
<p>（問）病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）通常在食後經一小時，胃部發疼病。（尤其是吃了酸味的或富於提出質的，或吃了米粉和酒等時候更著明）往往持續到下一回食事時爲止。疼痛，放散到脊部和兩肩胛部。若吃了食物或喝了飲料，便停止疼痛。</p>
<p>（問）胃酸過多症的人，食慾有無變化？</p>
<p>（答）食慾正常，或反而亢進。</p>
<p>（問）胃内有什麽不快？</p>
<p>（答）有吞酸，嘈雜，發酸性噯氣伴以痙攣性便秘。</p>
<p>（問）尿中有没有變化？</p>
<p>（答）尿的酸度减少，往往呈鹼必反應，有現燐酸成分的。</p>
<p>（問）胃内酸液過多時，對於食物的消化情形怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）對於肉類，容易消化；而對於炭水化合物很難消化。</p>
<p>（問）胃酸過多症的治療方法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）冶療胃酸過多症，食物和藥劑兩方面都須注意的。</p>
<p>（問）關於食物，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）食物最要避亢進胃液分泌的東西。一切食物，都行煮熟，不可吃焙烤的東西。</p>
<p>（問）含蛋白質的東西，可否攝食？</p>
<p>（答）蛋白質含得太多，雖能和遊鹽鹽酸結合，但有使分泌亢進之慮。所以不如吃少含蛋白質的東西，像牛乳，卵白，煮肉等東西較好。</p>
<p>（問）脂肪可否攝食？</p>
<p>（答）脂肪對於胃酸過多，有抑制之效，所以最爲合宜。</p>
<p>（問）調味品和茶，及咖啡等可否攝用？</p>
<p>（答）因爲都能促進胃分泌，都不相宜。</p>
<p>（問）藥劑應當用什麽？</p>
<p>（答）宜用鹼性劑，和收歛劑。鹼性劑如重炭酸鈉，煆性鎂，乾燥硫酸鈉等。收歛劑，像鉍劑。此外也可用些鎮痛劑像莨蓉浸膏，阿特羅品等。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（二十三）　實扶的里（俗稱白喉）</p>
<p>實扶的里是從原名Diphtherie譯音而來的一個病名。普通一般俗間稱爲白喉，喉風，喉痧，咽頭喉風等等。也都是指着實扶的里而言。其實這種名稱。似乎不大妥當。因爲實扶的里。並不單獨發生在喉部。他也可以發生在咽頭和鼻腔兩處。而且從臨診經騐上看起來。反以發於咽頭的時候較多。所以决不可用白喉或喉風二字。即可代表實扶的里。祇可將發於咽頭的實扶里。稱爲咽頭實扶的里。發於喉頭的實扶的里。稱爲喉頭實扶的里。發於鼻腔的實扶的里。稱爲鼻腔實扶的里。這樣才覺確當。</p>
<p>實扶的里的病原菌。是一千八百八十三年Loeffler氏發見的。稱爲Loeffler氏桿菌。因爲這種桿菌只可發生實扶的里。所以就稱他是實扶的里桿菌。常常存在實扶的里病人患部的僞膜當中。對於乾燥的抗抵力狠强。不容易死滅。在秋末初春天氣乾燥的時候。很容易流行實扶的里。也許因爲他的對於乾燥抵抗力强固的緣故啊。他雖存在患部的僞膜當中。然而他的毒素。則常侵入病人的全身。所以本病病人的全身症狀。反比局部症狀來得嚴重。他的傳染徑路。最多的，是扁桃腺。其次是鼻腔和喉頭。還有眼結膜，中耳，外陰部粘膜，皮膚小創等等。亦可侵入。但是很少。又本病往往和連鎖狀球菌，葡萄狀球菌或其他病原菌。混合傳染。此時局部的症狀。大都劇烈。</p>
<p>本病最易感染的年齡。要算從二歲至七歲的兒童最多。素有口　扁桃肥肥大症的兒童。更易發生。十四歲以後感染的。則漸次减少。所以在成人的年齡。感染本病的。比較很少。患過一次實扶的里。將來未必即得免疫性。因爲他的免疫性極短的緣故。有時反而增加本病再發的傾向。</p>
<p>實扶的里的傳染。多半是接觸傳染。像（一）病人咳嗽。（二）病人的衣服，被褥，書籍，食物，痰唾和小兒的玩具。（三）近距離的空氣等等。均可感染本病。在一個多兒童的家庭當中。若有患着本病的小兒的時候。常可傳染到他的姊妹兄弟。所以像幼稚園和小學校的兒童。如果傳染起來。那就很多傳染的機會。最危險的事實。就是在最初發病。而患兒尚未感覺。有病的時候。他的口腔裏面。已經含有本病的病原菌。或者患兒方才痊愈。而照常到校的時候。他的口腔裏面。尚含有本病的病原菌。有這兩種的機會。他的傳染。當然更易。説到這裏。我要奉勸患兒的家長的。就是在患兒痊愈的時候。須要經過醫師的證明許可。方可令他到校。我要希望學校當局的。就是在實扶的里流行的時候。必項時時刻刻注意兒童的口腔衛生。遇有可疑的兒童。應當立刻囑托校醫。施行診察。或者立即送回家屬。延醫診視。方爲妥當。千萬不可輕視啊。（未完）</p>
<h3>肺結核淺説（二十八）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>肺部爲什麽會發生濁音呢？這也有好幾種原因的。現在且僅説和本症有關係的。就是：在肺小泡裏而充滿實物或液體，構成病理解剖上所稱的浸潤狀態時，在他所在的部份，就會有濁音發生的。當然呢，他的侵潤面積須到相當的大小方行的。這一方面的舉例，除開本病外，像肺炎，肺膿瘍，肺壞疽，都是一樣的。這幾種病症和本症的濫别，僅靠打診是無辦法的；一定要經過聽診手續，或其他的檢查，方可水落石出的。</p>
<p>肺部怎樣會發生鼓音呢？他的成因是和本症關係極大的。第一是肺組織發生空洞：此空洞須有胡桃樣大小，始能由打診音響證明的。第二由於胸膜腔裏面含有氣體，所謂氣胸是。他的原因，大半因肺壁經本症的破壞，支氣管和胸膜腔連通而構成的。此外，還有一事也應該連帶提及的。就是：人工氣胸的治療本病，現在是非常普遍的。如果醫者在打診時發見鼓音了，一定要同時注意，是否由施行人工氣胸治療竹構成的。這問題的解决固然是不難，但也是千萬不可忽略的。</p>
<p>Ｃ聽診。　怎樣呌聽診呢？就是醫者以耳直抵患者的體壁，或體與耳間用一種器械，（聽診器，）以檢查身體内部現象之謂。這二種辦法，比較係藉聽診器來得凖確；因爲用耳祇能聽見大部分的音，至於局部小面積的地方，是狠容易忽略的；再則在胸壁有許多地方，用耳擊貼，有時是辦不了的。這一種檢查手續的應用，幾乎是僅限於胸部（心肺）的。在肺部行使這種手續，患者應同時作深呼吸的；這方面所聽到的肺胞呼吸音，名曰肺胞音，尋常在健肺方面發生的，即係此種。假使肺部生病理變化狀態時，呼吸音也會有種種異態，其至會發生其他雜音的。這方面詳細情形，當然不是在本文所可盡的；現在且將和本症有關的幾種寫在下面。</p>
<p>肺泡音有時會變爲微弱的。他的原因狠多，像氣管枝因分泌物而閉塞是最會發生：就是肺組織有浸潤狀態，或發生空洞，都會如此的。有時呼吸音比較粗糙了，所謂不純粹呼吸音是。這種狀態，在肺結核初期有時剛巧會發生的。如果肺組織發生浸潤狀態，或且是緊縮了，在平常聽取肺泡音的地方，會發生另外的氣管枝音的。像本症，肺炎，都是最著的例證。但肺炎浸潤部分，大半是在中下葉的，結核則大半在肺上葉，這是應該留意的。呼吸音帶有鑛音或鑛性餘響者，名壺性呼吸音。他是和吹氣入壺的雜音狠類似的，在肺部發生大空洞的時候，是最易發現的。</p>
<p>如果在肺部的氣道或肺胞裏面，積有液體或粘質（如粘液，膿，血液，腫脹液體。）時，他的口徑當然是比較狹小的；在這個時際呼吸，會發生另外的副雜音的，這就是「水池音了」！他大致可分乾性濕性二種的。濕性的發生，必須有流動性分泌物的，流動性越多，他的音也愈帶濕性。乾性則係粘稠液的關係。屬於乾性方面的，有類鼾音，吹笛音，叱咤音，等種，不同的音響。這部是因氣管枝中粘液緊張，呼吸的空氣經過裏面，振盪而起的。屬於濕性方面的，有大水泡音中，水泡音大水泡音，這都是因其音的大小强弱而加以分别的。大水泡音見於大氣管枝和空洞，小水泡音係見於小氣管枝和最小氣管枝的。此外尚有有響和無響水泡音的分别，這是根據他的音響而立論的。這種種呼吸音的變態，以及副雜音的區分，我想讀者們一定是嫌目迷五色的：不錯，就是醫者在學習的時候，也感覺非常困苦的。至於他每種的眞相，也不是文字可以形容的，這完全要靠醫者的經騐，和他聰鋭的聽覺，纔可以迎刃而解的。</p>
<h3>發熱普通治療法（七）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>退熱法　在前次已經講過，發熱如不過高可不必想法退熱，所要注意的是增加病人抵抗力。前次也已講過加增抵抗力法就是：（一）使病人靜養，（二）供給他身體所需的一切滋養料。我們所講熱度不過高就是指短期發熱，熱度在一百零五度以下，長期發熱在一百零三度以下。換一句話講，就是只要病人　心休息再加增他的抵抗力，熱度到這些限度與他無大害處。但熱度若高過這些限度就與身體的細胞有害處。近年來精細比較各種退熱的利弊已知水療法是退熱最好的方法。</p>
<p>水療退熱法　熱度高的與熱度不很高的病人每日兩次洗身與身體有很大的益處。病若是輕可以沐浴，病若是重，可在床上由别人代洗。洗浴一可以使皮膚清潔排洩順利，二可以帮助血脈流通好些。我們曉得天氣炎熱時人都歡喜洗浴，很多人一日幾次洗浴，因爲沐浴後覺着内外清爽。須知發熱的病人無論何時所過的都是炎熱的生活，出汗常多，皮膚排洩廢料亦多，若將皮膚上的排洩物一日一兩次或兩三次洗去他自然覺得清爽，並且皮膚也可多作排洩工作，這樣也可間接帮助病快全愈。病人若是因發熱精神不安適或睡不成眠可用一濕被單將他全身包起。注意用濕皮單包病人時他的皮膚時時是紅的，並且他也不覺到冷。這樣是與他有益的。假設看見病人的皮膚是淡白色，他也時時覺着冷就不可用這個方法，因爲濕單包是與他有害的。我們用水療的方法退熱不單單把他的熱退去，並且同時也可以帮助病人血流好些，呼吸加强。</p>
<p>各種水療退熱法略述　少微研究過物理化學的，都曉得水是一種收藏熱放出熱的好媒介。這就是水可以收藏很多的熱也可以放出很多的熱。比如，沿海的地帶與同在一緯線的大陸中心氣候大不相同。沿海地方夏天不過熱冬天也不很冷，大陸的中心則不然，夏日炎熱冬天嚴寒，其原因爲大陸中心缺少水調和氣候之冷熱。那末，我們用水來調劑身體的温度當然是很合理性的。而且水更是到處有，也不必出多少代價。雖是如此平常的原料我們也不應當看不費重代價就算没有價值。應當利用這種普遍有的原料用醫學的方法來爲痛苦的病人造幸福。</p>
<p>在施行水療以前我們須知病人皮膚的狀况，血流好否，兩腎排洩功用健全與否，神經穩定與否。高熱度病人的皮膚若是乾且熱用温水（水温度約在華氏表八十五度或百度表卅度）替他洗身，一方面呌他覺着很爽快，一方面也可退熱。熱度高病人若是皮膚冷，第一步用熱水（温度華氏表一○五度百度表約四十度）洗身，先使血多流到皮膚。用熱水以外再加上揉擦亦可。皮膚發熱了就可用温水洗。如果還不發熱亦可用芥茉粉和水濕被單包身（法詳後）或給他熱咖啡，茶類血脈激刺品。有飲酒習慣的給酒少許亦無不可。皮膚若是凉縱熱度高也不可在他皮膚上用冷退熱。</p>
<p>還有一件須注意的就是對於病勢危急的用這些無害的退熱法也要小心不可要急烈，因爲在病勢沉重時一個人的生命就好像風地的殘燈，稍一不慎就要熄滅。故一方面注意他的熱度又一方面也須注意不要多撓動他。若是這一點不明白就用這種退熱法也是有害的。腎排洩不健全的發熱病人不用冷水替他退熱，應當用温水。例如呌他臥在温水（八十五度）浴缸内自半時至兩時之久亦無不可。發熱病人若是腦筋昏迷没有精神用冷水給他洗身或外加揉擦，很可以呌他精神一振，呼吸也立即加强有力，飲食消化轉佳。若是不替他施行這種手術，他當然還是繼續昏迷下去。假設發熱病人失眠，心急不定，用一濕的被單把他們包在内，外包乾毛氈就可呌他心神穩定，容易睡眠。兹分述幾種普通水療法以供病家採用：</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>拍</h3>
<p>— 皮</p>
<p>俗語説得好：「千穿萬穿馬屁不穿」這原是一句屢試屢騐的經騐之談，「馬屁」二字，雖不見於經傳，但其運用之妙，推銷之廣，也可稱得謂「上窮碧落下黄泉」了。</p>
<p>因此我也想去研究研究「拍馬」的方法，不但是一種「處世的藝術」而升官發財之道，也庶幾焉。於是費盡心機，把歷史上種種「拍馬」的方法，彙集攏來，「懸樑刺股」般的研究，但究屬時代不同，方法太舊，多不大適用。我小時某私塾的一位老先生，常常駡我道：「你這小孩子脾氣太壞，到底不堪造就。」或者也是爲我的脾氣太壞之過，所以用不來這種方法。</p>
<p>西洋「馬屁術」是怎樣？因爲我没有讀「哀，皮，西，啼」的右行文字，没有研这分的資料。據説西人不喜「拍馬」專尚「吹牛」，他們「吹牛」的方法，很多很妙，我簡直像「劉老老初進大觀園，」眞是莫名其妙的。據説從前上海某藥房的老闆，深得其訣，故其事業做得十分偉大，即如前日美國人發明了「死光」説得驚天動地，不久德國人也發明了「死光」説得地動驚天，十分厲害。現在法國人也把「死光」發明了，也大吹大擂，自鳴得意。我中國人不尚「吹牛」專好「拍馬」，大約國民性剛柔的不同，故「吹拍」各異其趣麽？惟前見「永泊」先生「談誇大」一文，則外國人的風氣，或者也被聰明的中國人學會了麽？</p>
<p>有的説，拍馬亦未必有效的，俗語不是説過麽「拍馬拍在馬脚上，」非但拍不到好處，反而受其害者甚多，例如「滿清時有某佐雜，（小官）性好「拍馬」，而不學無術，一日，遇某長官於書肆，長官挈其二子，某佐雜欲進以恭維之辭，不能得。惟嘗聞贊人子之美者，往往曰犂牛之子，乃語某長官曰。二公子眞不愧爲犂牛之子，某長官大怒曰，以我爲犂牛乎？某佐雜大懼，知苗頭不對，比方差了。於是急轉其語曰，大人不是牛，卑職是牛，某長官更怒，力批其頰，曰這二子是你的麽？某佐雜仍抱頭鼠竄而去。」故欲「拍馬」而不善拍的，每得相反的結果，但這樣到底是例外的。</p>
<p>據説「拍馬」的利益比「吹牛」有出息，有長進，凡拍着一要人，或是有錢的人，非但直接受對方的賜與，果然無可限量。而人之拍其馬者，也如水就下，紛至沓來，如是所拍者不過一馬，而人之拍其馬者，或至不可勝數。故拍馬之利益，比較任何商業爲優，眞有意想不到的效力，所以中國人不喜「吹牛」而專好「拍馬」，其原因或亦在此。</p>
<p>並且「吹牛」要些本錢，而「拍馬」則不必本錢，因爲吹牛必有牛可吹，所以非本錢不可，而拍馬只是拍人之馬，所以不必要本錢。譬如某國吹牛發明「死光，」無論其牛之怎樣吹法，總得要「死光」一物，這就是所謂本錢，而拍馬則因人而施，只要一付拍馬手段，而運用之妙，存乎一心，所以中國人「拍馬」多而「吹牛」少，安知不是實騐主義之一種教訓麽？</p>
<h3>疲去了的秋林</h3>
<p>— 丁蔚南</p>
<p>樹木是凋枯了，葉子都脱落得光光地，祇剩着赤條條地的枝幹在似祈求上帝的照顧地的翹望着那蔚藍的天空。風本來是潑辣地吹，但是脱光了葉子的樹上，是看不見風底狂亂，祇有在那些地平上的衰草裏，可能找到她兇悍底行爲，没命的疾走，雖然風是那樣一味她的狂壓着這些没有抵抗的樹兒，而剥奪了它周身的葉子，但是像這樣叢密的一人多高不如的小樹兒；居然也能耐這風底陶冶的力，而不失其它固有葉兒，和着固有色澤而青的顔色。潑辣的風雖然是那樣欺弄它們，它眞不像那些老而無恥的，大而無力的高可參天底所謂「樑棟之材」的大樹，一到這時季裏它就失去了它曾經有過的威嚴！在詩人所讚賞的「萬紫千紅」的時季裏，也曾剥削過小同類們自然裏所給與着它的生命之源泉—抑壓着它們的勃發，而使之萎靡不振！風底魁力，風底醇醪，它狂瘋地飲着，它醉了，它滿臉通紅了，它倦乏了，它蕭蕭地下墮了，它缺乏着力的支持，它算是一度地被死去了！</p>
<p>鳥兒也很識趣地不那樣的饒舌了，祇還有那些不識相的鳩兒在那裏「苦呀，呀呀，」地的訴着：誰個也不會同情她們，縱使命運和她一樣的。儘管的訴，在這兒那兒儘管的訴；風還是那樣，不，而是加緊地颯颯的吹，瘋狂無情的掃，掃過枯老了的樹頭，掃過乾癟了的衰草，掃過了那畜類踐踏過的孤墳！</p>
<p>落日照在這疲去了的秋林裏，有幾家炊烟在屋頂上嫋出了時時幻變的畸形。糢糊而遠的鐘樓在糢糊而蒼茫的暮靄裏呈現着糢糊莫辨的鐘形。這裏失去了都市裏的煩囂，這裏呈示了我數年前離别了的故里底糢型！啊！故里呀，你遍體是受了傷痕，你那破碎的心，被那横暴者踏成了虀粉；你和平而甯靜底靈魂是被可怕的騷動震蕩得翼翼地抖顫！那素樸的渾厚的農民，從此餓着肚皮，在那些飢饉裏悲吟！啊！上帝呀，你何時是會給予我故里以甯靜！</p>
<p>人生眞是浮萍，我感痛着我故里底沉淪，我又感傷着我飄泊底無定！雲兒是那麽自由呵，然而我這没有被繩兒所羈縛着的靈魂，是怎樣地像被牢獄着一樣？這林裏每一樣的東西都比我安穩，眞不像我這水面上也似的浮萍！</p>
<p>小鳥有時也啾啾地呌着幾聲，像有隱痛似的不那樣十分的高興，眞是疲去了在這時序裏的所寄託底生命！風仍然吹掃着負着她底使命，她要迷惑着！不，摧殘着這自然裏的有葉子之林羣。横竪是將近掃光了，在這整的自然裏的有棄子之要羣，如果是有，那祇是醉了的將近睡下來的，祇有骨幹的苗條底瘦影，在這西下的斜暉裏悽摇，動蕩出它悲哀的祈求，輕柔的悲呌，誰個給與它們以同情？誰個給予它們以憐憫？可不是嗎？正像我們人類一樣，當你失時的時候，那些「趨炎附勢」「錦上添花」的人們，又是怎樣呢？</p>

<h3>鬭蟋蟀</h3>
<p>— 油琴</p>
<p>「㘗㘗㘗！」這所大厦原是人家的祠堂，自從那年改做了茶社之後，每到殘秋交冬的當兒，㘗㘗的呌聲，便喧滿了這茶社。許多老於鬭蟋蟀的人們，提着布包的一串串的蟋蟀盆子，多向那裏湧。</p>
<p>老金堂每年總有幾隻蟋蟀帶來上臺，往往也會贏幾塊錢。今年雖然窮，可是希望總有的，偷了老婆的衣裳當了錢來做資本。</p>
<p>「走開，有蟋蟀的來撞局！」那邊角裏有個沙桑子在喊，是呌人去登記　　對兒鬭的。</p>
<p>「唔！」老金堂便把經過秤手秤過的那隻「黄龍」送過去，依舊盆蓋上秤手標明的號數和重量，到屋角裏坐個八字鬚的周先生那邊去登記，同時，他便注意着登記簿上有没有可和他的對壘的。</p>
<p>「唔，四七三號倒和我的「黄龍」相仿……」老金堂找到了這個，便偷偷地去窺看那一號的蟋蟀，並且還賊忒忒的探聽了人家的蟋蟀。終於經老相識希明的介紹，才和四七三號的主人商妥，决定來四支花。是的，四支花是兩塊錢。</p>
<p>那鬭臺的四週堆滿了人，聲息可一些也没有。老金堂却在外面心跳。</p>
<p>「㘗㘗㘗，」他知道人堆裏，有别人的在鬭了。</p>
<p>「㘗㘗㘗！」這次的呌聲，他又肯定是决了勝敗，是的，看的人都在喊：「「白旗子」勝了。」於是老金堂心庠庠的，幻想自己的「黄龍」會戰勝了四七三號，挺着腿，仰着頭，翅膀裏振出勝利的呌聲，看客也會發喊：「「黄龍」勝了！」</p>
<p>「五六○和四七三上臺囉！」立刻臺上喊，打動了老金堂，他連忙擠進人羣去，把「黄龍」送上，眼看着兩個對坐的撁手，先把他和對手的蟋蟀，用紙筒傳進隔開着的鬭場去，又各把蟋蟀撁得興起，開了隔板，鬭拉！</p>
<p>蟋蟀在嗷着，跳着，踢着，壓在人堆下的老金堂的心，可就「剥剥」的跳個不住。</p>
<p>一分鐘，兩分鐘……好久了，眞個遇了敵手，大家都氣仰仰的，四七三號的主人，也在一旁不安着。</p>
<p>「啊！」陡的「黄龍」一退，老金堂駭了一跳，手摸着袋裏的錢。幸虧「黄龍」又抖撇着精神在鬭，鬆了他一口氣。</p>
<p>看的人都屏息着氣，有的還在替他們主人着急。</p>
<p>啊，不興，「黄龍」有些却了，老金堂的心，可要跳出口來了，眼也花，頭也有些發暈；四七三號的主人可就笑容堆滿了嘴角。</p>
<p>「㘗㘗，㘗㘗㘗！」老金堂可駭得抖了，彷彿有些不像自己的蟋蟀的聲音。好呀，「青元勝了！」比雷還響，震破了老金堂的心。</p>

<h3>下小館子</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>本來，像我們這樣吃包飯的人，館子，對於我們是少有往來的，提到下館子，似乎不是一件平常的事。</p>
<p>包飯，差不多誰都會領略到其中的况味的，是要聽憑人家的指揮，人家給你吃這樣，你就得吃，不准反抗，好像這飯是出於賞賜似的，不然的話，説不定你會遭受着白眼，再重一點，也許一言不合，拳足相見的。</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>假使下館子，那可以全聽「尊便」了，你要這樣，人家不敢那樣，你要口味重一點，他們不敢放得淡一點，只顯着自己的威風，不看見他們的沉臉。</p>
<p>這原因，就在「錢」的一點上。一個的錢是出在論月的整批上，而另一個則是出在隨便的零買上，整批，那「小賑」是不會有的，因爲既稱包飯，附帶的連小賑也認爲是「包」在裏面的，即使能有，不用問，那也是極有限的，不像零吃的人那麽爽快，在擦完了嘴以後，那花擦花擦的東西就會滚進了竹筒，或者是貼有黄金萬兩的錢櫃。</p>
<p>然而那是指的大飯館，要是在小館子，雖不見得有那樣的風光和場面，但，和包飯的比較一下，畢竟要佔着上風的。</p>
<p>不知怎麽，這兩天總是想要下一趟館子，雖説我所包的飯還算不錯，但是，這顆不能穩定的心，總是在向館子裏飛。</p>
<p>邀了老李和小朱，在一天的晚上，趁着寒冷的風，極隨便的走去。</p>
<p>在路上，我有點躊躇了，我想，到那一家館子呢？北方的口味對我是最適宜的。那末，同興樓？大雅樓？但是這些地方的場面太大，於是我們三個人到了一家天津小館子，地方很湫隘的，隔成了内外兩間，大概那是天津館子的特色，在外間，大的灶，凌亂的桌案和碗箸之類的東西，堆滿了兩旁，在裏間，那幾張紅漆的褪了色的八仙桌子，油膩積滿了桌縫的四周，而凌亂的程度，並不比外間來得高明。</p>
<p>隨便的，我們要了兩樣菜，在這裏，燒酒也是須要的，我們在慢慢地飲着，吃着，雖没有詩人的情趣，但却有異常的豪興。</p>
<p>完了，臉都有點紅，堂倌照例的送上了毛巾，假使來比擬的話，那末，這毛巾就像三友社出品的灰色軟自由呢。</p>
<p>在北方的小館子裏，畢竟還有一點是值得一記的，那就是當你的小賑交到了堂倌以後，他們會一喊連聲的答應着，像春雷的震動一樣。</p>
<p>走了出來，心頭彷彿有塊什麽東西鬆解了是的。眞的，雖説我包的飯還算不錯，然而，那味道，這回的館子畢竟要佔上風的。</p>
<h3>菊花時節</h3>
<p>— 僑生</p>
<p>那天我獨自個上北四川路一家茶樓去，這是我所熟極了的，幾乎每天都得去一次的地方。跑上樓，什麽都一樣，我照例揀了窗口那個位子坐下來，放下挾在臂間的雜誌；秋計是不問也曉得我要一壺龍井茶的，很快地就手巾一同送了上來。我坐下去，鬆了一口氣，拿起手巾揩了一回手。然後，我倒下一杯茶，我喝下一口去。</p>
<p>天氣已經是秋深了。</p>
<p>所以，一杯熱茶是可以增加身體的温度的。</p>
<p>因爲是午後三點鐘光景，又不是休假日，茶樓上寂寥地只有三幾個人。我靜靜地坐在那裏，打開雜誌來，我要把一段關於安得生的文章唸完。</p>
<p>那年青的伙計，也許是因於不慣冷清的緣故，不知道什麽時候站到我的身邊來了。</p>
<p>然而，他没有説話。</p>
<p>我看我的雜誌。</p>
<p>大約過了十來分鐘！</p>
<p>「×先生，菊花已經開了。」</p>
<p>他忽然這樣對我説了一句。</p>
<p>我煩厭這年青伙計的打擾，想不踩他；但是，他却用手指着放在窗子旁邊的一盆菊花，使我不能不跟着瞧了一眼</p>
<p>哦，多麽美麗的花朶呵！</p>
<p>黄色的菊花是會帶我回到記憶里去的。—兩年前的秋天，也許是十一月吧，我們大學裏開着菊花大會：這是照例每年都有一次的。</p>
<p>一早，我去找她。</p>
<p>「看菊花去呵！」</p>
<p>把她從宿舍里拉了出來，直往菊花叢里跑。菊花有着各種不同的顔色，不同的姿態，教我們瞧了半天還不滿足。</p>
<p>「我喜歡紅色的。」</p>
<p>「我喜歡白色的。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽？」</p>
<p>「因爲她潔净。」</p>
<p>是的，她是那麽愛好着潔净的東西呵！</p>
<p>於是，把她安置在白色的菊花之前，給這年輕的女同學照了一張像—後來我把她放大到二十四寸。…</p>
<p>然而兩年是過去了。…</p>
<p>這天我從北四川路回來，特意檢出那張照片注視了一些時候。照片是褪色了；我那女同學的印象在腦筋里也漸漸糢糊起來。</p>
<p>我想，再過兩年，我恐怕要完全忘記她的吧？</p>
<p>而現在，可又是菊花時節了。</p>

<h3>Chiang Flies from Taiyuan via Hankou to Xunyang</h3>
<p>Discussed current affairs with the chairmen and generals of Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces in Taiyuan</p>
<p>Arrived in Taiyuan yesterday morning, and flew south at noon, arriving in Hankou for a brief rest before transferring to the "Yongsui" warship to Xunyang</p>
<p>Soong Mei-ling and H.H. Kung flew to Beiping</p>
<p>Yang Yongtai led his entourage south by train</p>
<p>[Hankou] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek flew south from Taiyuan at 12:00 noon on November 11th on a Eurasia plane, arriving at Hankou Shijiadun Airport at 3:30 pm. His entourage included only the Chief Guard Xuan Tiewu, Secretary Wang Rizhang, and one adjutant. Because the plane carried foreign passengers, Chiang originally intended to remain on the plane after arriving in Hankou, and leave after the passengers disembarked and fly to Nanchang. However, the aviation station here received a telegram from Nanchang saying that the weather was bad and it was not convenient for flying. Therefore, Chiang temporarily stayed in Hankou for several hours. Upon hearing the news, Director He of the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters immediately went to the airport in his own car to greet him, and accompanied him to the Deming Hotel for rest. Director He also notified Deputy Commander Zhang and Provincial Chairman Zhang by telephone to visit him. After Chairman Chiang met with Deputy Commander Zhang and Chairman Zhang at the hotel, he took the "Yongsui" warship to Xunyang at 10:00 pm on the 11th to transfer to Nanchang. Those who saw him off at the Sanbei Wharf included Zhang Xueliang, He Chengjun, Zhang Qun, Qian Dajun, Ye Peng, Wu Guozhen, Chen Xizeng, Cai Mengjian, Tang Guozhen, Zhou Fangjin, and dozens of others. The police department and the public security bureau sent plainclothes investigators and police officers to guard the wharf. At about 10:00, Chiang and Zhang Xueliang took car No. 12 from the Deming Hotel directly to the Sanbei Wharf. On that day, Chiang wore a yellow woolen Zhongshan suit, a black cloak, and a felt hat. He was in high spirits and frequently nodded to the well-wishers. He insisted that they not board the ship. All the well-wishers stood together on the dock to see him off respectfully. The "Yongsui" warship sounded its horn and set sail at 10:15. Chiang stood on the deck, took off his hat, and greeted the well-wishers, saying, "Everyone, don't be polite, go back quickly." The "Yongsui" warship immediately left Hankou for Xunyang. Also, Chiang's special train has now arrived in Shijiazhuang. Yang Yongtai and others left Taiyuan at 2:00 pm on the 11th to Shijiazhuang to transfer to the special train south, and are expected to arrive in Hankou around noon on the 13th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Chairman Chiang departed from Taiyuan at 9:00 am on the 11th on a Eurasia plane with a total of five Chinese and foreign entourage members, arriving at Hankou Wangjiadun Airport at 3:30 pm. He went to the Deming Hotel to rest and met with Zhang Xueliang, He Chengjun, Qian Dajun, Ye Peng, Wu Guozhen, and others. Yang Yongtai and others left Taiyuan on the 11th by car to Shijiazhuang, transferring to the Pinghan train south, and will arrive in Hankou on the 13th to transfer to Jiangxi. Liu Xiang's representative Qiu Jia visited Chiang on the 11th, asking about the date and location for Liu Xiang's visit to Chiang. Liu is scheduled to fly to Jiangxi by plane within a few days. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Chiang returned to Taiyuan from Taigu at 9:00 this morning, and summoned the provincial committee members and the heads of various departments to the headquarters. After the meeting, he went to the airport. Yan Xishan and Zhao Daiwen, Zhang Jia, Song Zheyuan, Yang Yongtai, Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, Fu Zuoyi, Sun Chu, and other military and political figures went to the airport to see him off. The security along the way was very strict. Various agencies, organizations, and school students lined up outside the North Gate to greet him. Chiang talked with Yan Xishan and others for a few minutes at the airport, and then told Xuan Tiewu and others to board the plane and fly south. Soong Mei-ling, feeling slightly unwell, flew to Beiping by plane with H.H. Kung at about 2:00. The well-wishers were as before. Yang Yongtai and all of Chiang's entourage left Taiyuan at about 2:00 by a Zhengtai special train to go south to Shijiazhuang. Chiang summoned the chairmen and generals of Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan to Taigu last night and briefly discussed current affairs. Before leaving, Chiang rewarded the troops with 20,000 yuan, the police and military police with 3,000 yuan, and the servants with 300 yuan. Chiang and Yan Xishan met several times, talking and laughing happily. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] H.H. Kung, accompanied by Madame Chiang Kai-shek Soong Mei-ling and entourage, took a Ford plane from Taiyuan at 2:15 this afternoon and arrived at Nanyuan Airport at 4:30. After disembarking, they went to the Beijing Hotel with the welcoming party for rest. Tonight, Ding Chunwan, Ning Encheng, Wu Daye, Zhang Yongnian, and others hosted a banquet for Kung and his entourage. Kung said, "My trip to Shanxi was to welcome Chiang's visit to Shanxi and to inspect the financial and water conservancy conditions in North China. I will only stay in Beiping for two or three days, and then go to Tianjin. Soong and Fu invited me to visit Chahar and Suiyuan. If time permits, I will go. Regarding the water conservancy projects of the Fen River, Hai River, and Yongding River, and the Yellow River disaster relief, I will discuss everything with the relevant parties nearby. The expenses of the Beiping Military Branch will be assisted by the Hebei Provincial Government with 200,000 yuan in the past. Starting from November, the national treasury will allocate 100,000 yuan, and the Hebei Provincial Government can reduce its burden by half." (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] After receiving the news this afternoon that Madame Chiang and H.H. Kung had left Taiyuan for Beiping, Huang, accompanied by his wife Shen Manying, and He Qigong, Yuan Liang, Yu Jinhe, Ding Chunwan, Ning Encheng, and others, went to Nanyuan Airport to welcome them. After Soong and Kung disembarked, they were accompanied by Huang and his wife to change to cars and enter the city, staying at the Beijing Hotel. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] At noon today, Chiang Kai-shek and Xuan Tiewu took a Junkers large aircraft of the Eurasia Company and left Taiyuan. Chiang's Secretary-General Yang Yongtai, along with his entourage, took a special train from Taiyuan to Shijiazhuang at 3:00 pm today, and then returned south on the Pinghan Railway.

<h3>Date of Receiving Malanyu Is Not Yet Determined</h3>
<p>Yin Rugeng and Shibayama held concrete consultations</p>
<p>Shibayama went to Tianjin again to meet with Meijin</p>
<p>[Beiping] After Yin Rugeng returned to Beiping the night before yesterday, he visited the Japanese military attache Shibayama yesterday to discuss the matter of receiving Malanyu in concrete terms. It is reported that the reception period has not been completely arranged due to various reasons. It is still uncertain whether it will be realized on the 15th. Shibayama is going to Tianjin this morning to consult with Meijin, the commander of the Tianjin Garrison Army, again. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] A certain unit of the security team stationed in Xinglong County was originally scheduled to go to Malanyu on the 24th to take over defense. Now, because the reception period of Malanyu has not been determined, it is also uncertain whether it will go to Malanyu on the 14th. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Regarding the reception of Malanyu, the Japanese side, due to the misunderstanding between the Japanese soldiers and the militia in Huairou County a few days ago, made excuses that our team lacked training and was unreliable, and the proposal to return Malanyu must be postponed, and the proposal to implement the reception by us on the 15th has become empty talk again. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Endo Goes to Huludao for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Beiping] A person from Yuguan talked about it.

It is said that Endo's inspection of Huludao is of great significance. The Japanese plan for the Huludao Great Military Port will start construction in the spring of next year. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>There Is a Proposal to Expand the Urban Area of ​​Beiping</h3>
<p>[Beiping] There is a saying recently that the urban area of ​​Beiping will be expanded. It is heard that Nanyuan, Huangcun, Fengtai, Caiyuzhen, Faxianzhen, Qingyundian, Sunhe, and other districts belonging to Daxing County, and Changxindian, Lugouqiao, Mentougou, Qinghezhen, and other districts belonging to Wanping County, will be placed under the jurisdiction of Beiping. If it is realized in the future, then the land tax and miscellaneous taxes that should be collected annually in the districts belonging to Daxing and Wanping will be 45,000 yuan for Daxing and 67,000 yuan for Wanping. After the district boundaries are determined, the Beiping urban area will extend to Tongzhou in the east, Tangshan in Changping in the north, Liangxiang in the west, and Anci in the south. After the urban area is expanded, the police stations in the four suburbs will also expand their organization according to the methods in the city. However, this is just a proposal, and whether it will be realized has not been completely decided. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The Beiping Municipal Government is preparing to merge the two counties of Daxing and Wanping into the region after the expanded organization is realized, and divide them into two experimental zones for culture and agricultural affairs, and set up public security sub-bureaus. The population will increase by 1.2 million at that time. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Henan Provincial Government Plans to Set Up Kaifeng City Separately</h3>
<p>[Kaifeng] The provincial government plans to divide the four suburbs of Bian into Chenliu, Lanfeng, and Zhongmou, and set up Kaifeng City separately. Small counties such as Boai and Weichuan will be abolished. Important market towns that are conducive to preventing bandits will be set up as county seats. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Ruijin Has Been Recovered</h3>
<p>The Eastern Route Army marched into the city in formation</p>
<p>The bandits retreated towards Yudu and Huichang</p>
<p>The bandit suppression enters the post-war stage</p>
<p>[Nanchang] The headquarters announced today that the vanguard team of the Eastern Route Army, the Li Mo'an Division, captured Ruijin City on the 10th. Song Xilian detoured south of Ruijin to Tiaomijie. The pseudo-local independent battalion guarding here retreated towards Yudu and Huichang, and is being pursued. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Nanchang] After capturing Ruijin on the 10th, Chiang will devote all his efforts to clear the bandits and carry out post-war reconstruction. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Nanchang] When the Eastern Route Army captured Tingzhou City, the Li and Song divisions directly captured the pseudo-capital Ruijin. The main force of the bandits all retreated to the west. The pseudo-local independent battalions guarding the nest were all defeated and retreated towards Yudu and Huichang. The Li Division entered Ruijin City first on the 10th, and the Song Division detoured around Tiaomijie south of Ruijin to join forces. The pseudo-capital was shaken and has entered the post-war period. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Beijing Office of the Eastern Route Bandit Suppression Army Headquarters received a telegram from the headquarters in Zhangzhou stating that the Li Mo'an Division captured Ruijin on the 10th. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Nanchang] Military news, the Li Mo'an Division has occupied Ruijin on the 10th, and the bandits have collapsed and fled to Yudu and Huichang. When the division entered the city, the people welcomed them on both sides of the road. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Nanchang] After the news of the recovery of Ruijin was received here, all walks of life in the military and political circles were extremely excited. Ruijin has been occupied by the Red bandits for several years, issuing orders. Now that the bandit den has been destroyed, it is no longer a problem to eliminate the remaining communists. Although today is a weekly holiday, all levels of staff in the headquarters are still working, listening to reports from all parties, and giving instructions. According to a senior general, since the successive capture of Shicheng, Xingguo, and Ningdu last month, the bandit den has long been showing signs of shaking. When the Eastern Route Army captured Changting, the bandit's throat was strangled, and they could not support it even more. The remaining bandits fled west from Ruijin one after another. This time, the recovery of the bandit den was generally very smooth, although there were occasional contacts along the way. Some bandit leaders were among the remaining bandits who fled west, and our army is tracking and pursuing them in order to capture them all at once. Currently, only Yudu and Huichang are left in the bandit area in Jiangxi Province, and it will not be difficult to take advantage of the victory and go down. The military affairs of suppressing bandits in Jiangxi Province will come to an end in a very short period of time. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Fuzhou] Military news, the bandit suppression military affairs continue to make progress. The troops of the Eastern Route Army have advanced towards Xintian. After this, only Huichang and other scattered bandit areas will be cleaned up soon. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>Longxi: A person from Changting talked about it. Before the bandits withdrew on the 31st of last month, they captured and killed more than a thousand merchants and civilians who failed to extort money. Jin Wang Mutang, a former scholar in the Qing Dynasty, had a good reputation in Ting. The bandits hated him for some reason and killed his entire family of more than ten people before leaving. The corpses were displayed all over the street, which was unbearable to witness. Our national army entered the city and buried them, which took two days. When the bandits retreated, they burned all the bridges in the four cities (Tingzhou City is built by the Tingjiang River and is surrounded by water on three sides) to prevent the national army from advancing. Now they are rushing to repair the 40-mile highway from Hetian to Ting, working day and night, and it will be completed soon. The city of Tingzhou is in a state of depression, but the people are at peace. Many refugees who fled abroad before have returned to their hometowns. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<h3>Luan-Yu District Administrative Conference Discusses Local Security</h3>
<p>The county magistrate of Lulong fell and died</p>

<h3>The Court Files a Public Prosecution in the Yi Peiji Palace Case</h3>

<h3>Liu Kejun Explains the Doubts About Two Crimes in the Criminal Law</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The new criminal law reduces the age of raping a woman from sixteen to fourteen, and the adultery issue of the crime of obstructing the family still adopts the current criminal law. Also, the sentence is reduced by one year, and Article 161 of the gambling crime is changed to punishing those who gamble for property in public places or places where the public can enter and exit. There are many doubts in the society. The reporter went to Liu Kejun, the convener of the Criminal Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan, to ask for his opinion. According to him, regarding the first point, the difference between the new criminal law and the current criminal law is that the new criminal law separates Article 240, Paragraph 2 of the current law into two articles. For example, Article 221, Paragraph 2 stipulates that raping a woman under the age of fourteen is considered rape, and Article 227 separately stipulates the punishment for the situation of raping a woman over the age of fourteen but under the age of sixteen, which is also quite severe. This is stipulated after considering both academic theory and facts. The outside world mistakenly believes that the new criminal law does not protect women over the age of fourteen but under the age of sixteen, or because they failed to comprehensively view the preceding and following articles. Regarding the second point, women's circles strongly advocate reconsideration, but the bill has already gone through the three-reading procedure, and individuals are not in a position to advocate anything. Regarding the third point, the purpose of the general assembly's special approval of the amendment is to focus on preventing the use of criminal law to disturb the people. As for those who gamble as a profession, or intend to provide gambling venues or gather people for gambling for profit, the punishment is still severe, such as Articles 267 and 268. It seems that this provision does not condone gambling. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Commemoration of the Premier's Birthday</h3>
<p>— Rang</p>
<p>Time flies. It is again the anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. People today deeply admire Mr. Sun's great achievements for the nation. Considering the current difficult times, many express their sentiments through writing on his birth anniversary. So, what more can be said on this commemoration? The world situation is becoming increasingly urgent. The crisis of 1935 is imminent. The Premier was born to save the country and its people. How then should we, who live after the Premier, be filled with awe and fear, to uphold the Premier's legacy, and strive with vigor and determination? Though I am not talented, I wish to put forward several points for the people of the nation.</p>
<p>The organization of modern national politics generally has a consistent trend: strictness and centralization. Especially since the global economic panic of 1929, the affected area has widened, the suffering has deepened, and international politics have been turbulent. Social order is in danger of turmoil. Those in power, faced with these difficult times in the world, recognize the need for a change in political power. Thus, parliamentary politics are gradually declining, and central authority is strengthened. The aim is to ensure seamless communication between the top and bottom, like limbs controlled by the arms, to facilitate swift responses and rescue from chaos. This holds true, east and west. There is no other way. Cultivating national strength must begin with organization. Since the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, our country's politics have not been on the right track. American-style systems have been tried extensively, but parliamentary politics have turned members into "piglets" [a derogatory term for politicians seeking personal gain]. "Party-based governance" has led to conflicting opinions and little benefit to the nation. Now, as national difficulties worsen daily, when asked about their core beliefs, the people, from the court to the countryside, lack even idolatry. It is no wonder people criticize us for being disorganized. The strength of a nation arises from organization. A tightly organized nation is inherently strong. If a country is like a sheet of loose sand, and yet it clamorously hopes to revive the nation and save it from its difficulties, is it not the height of futility, abandoning the root and pursuing the branch? However, to achieve strict organization, the key is strengthening the center. This strengthened center must have a leader that the people trust to suppress disasters and fight for survival. So, who today in China is worthy of being such a leader? And who will support him? People often avoid discussing these questions. In fact, the question of leadership should not be a problem, nor should it be avoided. If one possesses strong real strength and a spirit of selflessness, the people will naturally support him. Once supported, there is no need for humility. Because the country has reached this point of crisis, those who bravely step forward are purely making sacrifices and have no rights. How many today are willing to sacrifice without seeking personal gain?</p>
<p>Today's leaders often say they face a tangled mess, with no place to start. When it comes to suppressing bandits, they rise and fall in different places, wasting effort. When it comes to finances, they are riddled with holes, at the end of their rope. When it comes to the economy, natural disasters are frequent, and rural areas are bankrupt. As for diplomacy, it is merely a matter of prolonging the inevitable and seeking temporary security. And national defense and military preparations are even more neglected. There is little hope of escaping a tragic fate. Yet, looking around the country, there are many grand pronouncements, but the trapped beast does not fight. Even among the upper echelons of society, few are truly willing to work hard and diligently. They are either ignorant of the way to save the country or too focused on personal gain, resulting in exploitation and a neglect of their duties. This allows the fundamental principles of governance to collapse and the social atmosphere to deteriorate daily. This kind of stagnant situation will only worsen over time, and its harmful effects will not stop until the nation's lifeline is severed. If we cannot quickly correct this, then there is no point in talking about the New Life Movement, let alone the traditional virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor. It will only widen the gap between the interests of society and deepen class hatred. To urgently correct this today, we must hope for those with pure hearts, those who bury themselves in hard work, and those who move forward bravely.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I must advise those in power that cultivating the foundation of the nation must not neglect the strength of the people. And the so-called strength of the people is in fact the people's physical and financial strength. But today in China, physical weakness is increasingly prevalent, and financially, most households are empty. Although the government has recently been actively promoting physical education and passively addressing the issue of narcotics, these deep-rooted illnesses are not easily cured. Moreover, with financial losses and the people struggling to survive, the livelihoods of the common people hang by a thread. This is due to the stagnation of the nation's productivity, directly resulting from the continuous economic aggression of imperialism. But the failure to fulfill the responsibility of protection is also undeniably blameworthy. The government's construction does not benefit the common people. This is the first point. The nation's governance has not been cleaned up, and there is much harassment of the people. This is the second point. Tariffs do not benefit domestic industries, and taxes are increasing daily. The people are becoming like beggars, so how can they resist foreign aggression and revive the motherland? The Premier said, "The primary task of construction is the people's livelihood." He repeatedly spoke of the close connection between the Principle of People's Livelihood and the principles of nationalism and democracy. This shows that without adequate food and clothing, there is no way to save the country. Therefore, the government authorities should first focus on strengthening the people's strength to boost morale, which is the most urgent task at present.</p>
<p>The Premier, who was born sixty-nine years ago, lived in a time of chaos and decline in the late Qing Dynasty. His revolutionary thoughts stemmed from an alarm about the state of the nation. Now, it has been ten years since the Premier passed away, and the state of affairs has worsened. The country is in crisis. Yet, this has failed to stimulate the court and the countryside to rise up, grasp his legacy, and persevere tirelessly. Is this truly a lack of awareness? It is knowing but not acting. Alas.</p>
<h3>U.S. War Department Prepares Large-Scale Air Defense Plan</h3>
<p>British Inspects Far East Air Route Again</p>
<p>Germany Renovates Cologne Airport</p>
<p>[Washington] The War Department is currently drafting a large-scale U.S. air defense plan, large enough to resist attacks from any direction. To complete this plan, it is necessary to first form an Air Force General Headquarters, directly under the command of the Chief of Staff. This air force must be able to resist the strongest enemy air force and be able to concentrate at any location in the United States within three or four days after receiving a warning. The announcement of this plan coincided with Lieutenant General Mitchell's criticism of the development of the Army Air Corps in the Federal Aviation Investigation Committee, saying that it was delayed by "Boy Scout-like" figures in the War Department. According to the War Department's plan, this Air Force General Headquarters will temporarily have about 450 fighters, including bombers, pursuit planes, and attack aircraft, stationed at seven or eight army airfields across the country. According to personnel from the General Staff Headquarters, after the establishment of this air force, the country will no longer be at risk of attack by foreign air forces. This plan was announced by Secretary of War Dern. He has ordered the existing army aircraft to be divided into 48 squadrons. Once the organization is completed, it will become the strongest air force in the United States, and the criticism of the Army Air Corps and the proposal to establish a separate Air Force department will also be somewhat reduced.

<h3>Anglo-Japanese Compromise Sound</h3>
<p>Breakthrough in Naval Impasse Said</p>
<p>Japan Not Insisting on Equality</p>
<p>[London] The *Sunday Referee* newspaper stated today that after the Japanese naval representatives visited the British Prime Minister's villa at the end of the week, the impasse has been broken, and a compromise can be reached in principle, allowing the naval conference to be held next year. The Japanese side has now expressed its willingness to accept a method that does not insist on naval equality, as the Anglo-Japanese alliance has been revived in a new form. Since the abolition of the old Anglo-Japanese alliance, British interests in the Far East have suffered greatly, hence this development. And the cotton war between the two countries should also be able to be terminated. Germany has already reached an understanding with Japan. The development between Britain and Japan may produce a new situation, making the remaining agreements between Britain and France even weaker. (Reuters Telegram from the 11th)</p>
<p>[London] It has long been clear that the trial proposal put forward by the British side is far from the fundamental demands of Japan. The Japanese delegation is now studying the secret strategy of how the British should recognize the common maximum limit for reaching this step. It has now been determined to outline the general situation of its policy. Representative Yamamoto and others are all in a wait-and-see attitude. When asked about their impressions, they discussed the following: Since the British side has this message, we have already decided on a method. Within this extent, no matter who we talk to, we will not be instructed in any way. Only international etiquette must still be maintained. As for the best way to approach the Japanese demands, we must choose. The only problem is this, and its policy has already been set and is difficult to change. As for the meeting with the British side, it has not yet been determined. It may be held roughly at the beginning of next week. Ambassador Matsudaira hosted a banquet on the evening of the 14th to entertain Mr. Sugimura, the Japanese ambassador to Italy. Representative Yamamoto and Colonel Iwashita and others were invited to attend. American representatives Davis and Admiral Standley have been out on an excursion since the morning of the 10th and will not be able to return until Monday. Therefore, this week is quite calm.

<h3>Situation of Japanese Autumn Maneuvers</h3>
<p>Maebashi Under the command of the Supreme Commander, this year's special army maneuvers were held in the three prefectures of the northern Kanto Plain, with the Konoe First, Second, and Fourteenth Divisions as the basis. The elite troops participating reached 48,000 people, plus the latest equipped mechanized units and 100 aircraft. The order to begin was issued at dawn on the 11th.

Abe, commander of the eastern army, presented a report on the military situation. He returned to headquarters at 11:15 AM. (Japan United Telegram from the 11th)</p>
<p>Sano The Second Division of the Eastern Army in this exercise deployed this morning at 6:00 AM in the Tomita, Azuma, and Tatebayashi areas. The cavalry group swept away the enemy troops on the front line, waiting for the arrival of the special forces of the First Division to the battle line to provide assistance. The Fourteenth Division of the Western Army confronted the Second Division on the Kiryu, Ashikaga, and Sano line. The Konoe Division, with mechanized units and tank units, faced the Eastern Army's cavalry group, deployed, and advanced. At 8:00 AM, the two armies encountered each other in the area of about ten miles north and south between Tomita, Sano, and Tatebayashi. The squadrons of aircraft of the two armies danced wildly in the air. The sound of artillery and gunfire mingled together. The 200,000 spectators were amazed by this magnificent battle. The Eastern Army, with its superior forces, firepower, and air force, only had the Second Division and the cavalry group participating in the initial stages of the battle. On the Western Army side, because the area was compact and the joint front was very skillful, the Second Division and the cavalry group of the Eastern Army had no choice but to retreat at 10:00 AM. However, the main force of the First Division soon joined the battle and began a fierce attack. Therefore, the Eastern Army reversed the decline and performed a back and forth battle in the Sano narrow pass. At 10:50 AM, the supervisory headquarters set fire to stop the battle. Each battle will be replayed at 5:00 PM and will enter the second operation around midnight. (Electric communication Telegram from the 11th)</p>
<h3>Gandhi Proposes New Village Life in India</h3>
<p>Begins Thrift, Self-Cultivation, and Hygiene Movement</p>
<p>Bombay Mahatma Gandhi has recently started a movement of thrift, morality, and hygiene, the purpose of which is to improve the lives of 500,000 Indian villages. Based on expert advice, Gandhi believes that the food of rural farmers contains more vitamins, and that coarse flour and brown sugar are more nutritious. Therefore, he generally advises farm families to use such foods, which both save money and are beneficial to the body. Also, several Indian millionaires have agreed to donate money to subsidize Gandhi's rural construction plan. Gandhi has formulated a plan to sever economic relations with Britain, believing that moral non-cooperation is not effective and that economic severance must be taken further. However, on the surface, Gandhi is acting prudently, using various methods to cover up his political goals. If not, the government can regard it as treason at any time and suppress his actions. His promotion of thrift, morality, and hygiene in rural areas is probably also a means. (Havas Telegram from the 10th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Republican Party Declares Party Platform Unchanged</h3>
<p>Still the Conservative Party in the Two-Party System</p>
<p>[Washington] The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Fletcher, issued a public declaration today, stating, "The Republican Party is not dead and will not die." Fletcher further said that the Republican Party will continue to fight on the platform it announced in the last election. Some leaders of the party advocate reorganization, but Fletcher indicated that the party should still be the conservative party in the two-party system government. This point by Fletcher may split the Republican Party, as some prominent members have already made left-leaning statements. Fletcher predicted today that the socialist policies of the "New Deal" will fail, and when they fail, the Republican Party will be the only party to take its place. Observers predict that the Republican members of Congress elected now support President Roosevelt and oppose radical inflationary policies and other radical bills. Therefore, after Congress opens, party distinctions may be completely eliminated when arguing over major issues. Some Democratic members of Congress in both houses are prepared to fight for bills opposed by the president, such as inflationary policies, while Republican members will support the president's proposals.

<h3>U.S. Budget Deficit</h3>
<p>[Washington] Government officials stated today that if Congress does not approve a reduction in appropriations to one-third of what the government needs, the hope of balancing the budget for the next fiscal year is very slim. The content of the government's budget proposal will likely not be released until January of next year. Business leaders have repeatedly asked the government for a definite guarantee of next year's finances, but judging from the current situation, it will be difficult for the president to announce before sending a message to Congress in January of next year. The president will first study the budgets of various departments. Although the government is also very willing to balance revenue and expenditure, it is unwilling to restrict itself in advance. It is recalled that in the last budget proposal, the president estimated that the expenditure in the two years up to the end of June next year would be US$16,529,805,667. At that time, it was said that the expenditure in 1936, including recovery and relief expenses, should be based on income. However, the federal government has been running a deficit since 1930. The expenditure for this year has already exceeded the income by 500 million yuan. (National Telegram from the 10th)</p>

<h3>Papen Discusses German-Austrian Merger</h3>

Even in Austria, we must fulfill our shared mission, which is of great importance to the future of Europe. For example, Austria's future, as seen by most people, is considered a potential threat to Europe, but it is merely a cultural issue. As for German-Austrian relations, the issue of merger is just a formality, because the policy of the new Germany is to unite the culture of all parts, not to quibble over the unification of national borders."

<h3>The Saar Commission's Work Makes Great Progress</h3>
<p>Rome - The three-member committee for the Saar region plebiscite, organized by the League of Nations Administrative Council and chaired by Italian Baron Aloisi, began meeting in Rome on the 6th of this month to examine various proposals regarding the Saar issue, with particular attention to financial and economic issues.

<p>Neustadt - The German Saar envoy Böckel returned to the country from Rome and, passing through here, made a statement to the local journalists, outlining his special mission to Italy and the results of this trip. Böckel said that the most important purpose of his trip to Italy was to clarify the League of Nations' various speculations about Germany. Therefore, what he most earnestly stated in Rome was that Germany had no intention of taking drastic action regarding the Saar. Because the Saar belongs 100% to Germany, and the outcome of next year's vote, in Germany's view, is undoubtedly a foregone conclusion, without any doubt. Böckel also stated that when he was in Rome, he made a request to the three-member committee, namely that French troops should withdraw from the Saar border, and that immigrants should be moved out of the country.

<h3>U.S. Will Urge Japan to Return Governance of the South Pacific Islands</h3>
<p>The Focus of Discussion for the League of Nations Mandates Commission</p>
<p>Japanese Claim They Have Invested Heavily in the Islands and It Would Be Difficult to Return Them</p>
<p>According to a Washington special telegram from the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on the 7th, the U.S. government authorities are paying close attention to the League of Nations Mandates Commission currently meeting in Geneva regarding the Japanese mandated islands in the South Pacific. Although the U.S. has no direct relationship with the commission and it is inconvenient to express opinions, the U.S. is concerned about how the South Pacific mandated islands will be handled after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. Therefore, the U.S. will actively discuss the matter. If Japan is proven to have constructed submarine and aircraft bases on these islands, the U.S. will deprive Japan of its mandate and give it to any other country. The U.S.'s reason is that these islands have a linked and important relationship with the Philippine Islands, Hawaii, Guam, and the U.S.'s Far East trade routes. If Japan builds defenses on the islands, it would have the ambition to threaten the U.S. Therefore, the U.S. will use legal arguments to dispose of the islands' right to continue governing the South Pacific islands whenever it has the opportunity. The Americans say that after the war, overseas territories cannot be ceded to one of the "major Allied Powers." The U.S. was originally one of the major Allied Powers. Although it governed these territories under the League of Nations, its mandate was not permanent. If the League of Nations takes action on Japan's continued governance of the South Pacific, the U.S. also has the right to speak. The recent sudden deterioration of U.S. public opinion toward Japan is due to the naval conference and the Manchurian oil control issue. The U.S. public has been greatly stimulated. On the one hand, the construction of defenses by Japan on the South Pacific mandated islands is even more unsatisfactory. Prominent New York newspapers have commented on this. In addition, it is also heard that the United Kingdom has an economic combination with Manchuria, Japan is trying to appease the Philippines, and Undersecretary of State Phillips has stated that Japanese authorities have refused U.S. naval officers to inspect the South Pacific islands. U.S. public opinion is very angry. However, when Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in March of last year, the U.S., Germany, and the League of Nations had discussions with Japan on demanding the return of the governance of the South Pacific islands. The U.S. said that it also has the right to speak on the South Pacific islands. At the same time, on March 24, Germany requested the Japanese chargé d'affaires in Germany to return the former territories. There has been no development since then. However, the issue itself, whether Japan has lost its mandate as a result of withdrawing from the League of Nations, is the subject of discussion for the League of Nations Mandates Commission. However, Japan has already invested 3 million yuan in state subsidies each year on the islands, so it will definitely not return them.</p>

<h3>Inauguration Ceremony of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge</h3>
<p>Held at Zhakou Station Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>A Massive Project Requiring a Year and a Half to Complete</p>
<p>The Qiantang River Railway Bridge, connecting the transportation of the two Zhe (Zhejiang) provinces, is of utmost importance to the connection of national railways and highways. The idea of building it was first proposed twenty years ago. Finally, with the joint efforts of the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the support of the financial community and people from all walks of life, the plan was successfully decided. Yesterday at 10 a.m., the inauguration ceremony was held at Zhakou Station. Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming of the Ministry of Railways, prominent figures from Zhejiang's political and business circles, and guests from Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, totaling over 5,000 people, attended. Residents from nearby areas also came to watch in an endless stream, truly making it an unprecedented grand occasion. The bridge project is massive, requiring a year and a half to complete. Once completed, it will not only be convenient for the people of eastern and western Zhejiang, but the entire nation will also benefit greatly in terms of economy, politics, and national defense. The details of the grand inauguration ceremony of the Qiantang River Bridge are recorded below.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue</p>
<p>The venue was set up on the open space next to Zhakou Station, between Fuhang Road and the Qiantang River.

The couplet on both sides read, "Transforming natural obstacles into ease, no need to ask about the tides coming and going; Starting a delightful journey, let us sing loudly about the endless flow of traffic." Beside the Qiantang River, there was also a colorful archway, with the words "Inauguration Ceremony of the Qiantang River Bridge" in round-framed white cotton regular script on the front. On both sides of the archway, there were two other couplets: (1) "A long rainbow from afar, the silver waves and white horses lose their fierce power; With ancient pagodas as neighbors, the sounds of bells and chimes have a clear rhythm," (2) "Benefiting the country and the people, laying this foundation for ten thousand years; Linking Jiangnan and Jiangbei, connecting the transportation of seven provinces." In front of the archway was the groundbreaking site, with over ten hoes and shovels prepared, tied with red and green cloth. About ten paces inside the colorful archway on Fuhang Road, a commemorative tablet was erected. The front was engraved with "Commemoration of the Inauguration of the Qiantang River Bridge, Established on November 11th, the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Zeng Yangfu," and other characters. The back had a hole prepared for setting up the central axis needle. Beside the commemorative tablet was a screen, with the four large characters "Connecting the Two Zhes" written on it. Below it were various planned blueprints of the railway bridge. The venue was temporarily set up, covered with reed mats. Small national flags and small flower balls were crossed throughout the venue. Two couplets were hung on the pillars: "The key to transportation in the southeast lies here; The Qiantang pillar will forever solidify the golden soup," "A monumental work for thousands of years, even better than Duan Ao establishing the ultimate pole; Ten thousand people happily cross, no need to cast crossbows to shoot at the tide." On the podium, the national flag and the portrait of the Prime Minister were hung. All the diagrams and explanatory notes were also posted on the left and right, along with various slogans. In front of the podium was a one-percent scale model of the railway bridge. The bridge was divided into two layers, with railway tracks laid below and a highway paved above. The bridge surface was for vehicles and pedestrians to pass. Both ends of the bridge were semi-circular, each 220 feet long. Various toy vehicles were placed on the bridge, attracting the interest of guests throughout the venue. In front of the podium was the press section, and behind it was the guest section, which could accommodate over a thousand people. Because there were so many participants, more than a thousand people were standing and watching around the perimeter. From the entrance of the venue, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau and police stations along the two roads secretly dispatched police officers to stand guard along the road. There were also police officers in the venue to maintain order. The public was not allowed to wander around on the road at will, and they were all instructed to visit the venue. As a result, the traffic was heavy and extremely crowded. All vehicles were parked in the open space behind the venue. Attendees</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Following the ritual, Chairman Director Zeng delivered the opening speech, saying, "Today, at the inauguration of the Qiantang River Bridge, I am very honored to have representatives from all parties and guests from afar participating. Now, I will briefly report on the process of building the bridge. As you all may recall, during the January 28th Incident two years ago, the people of Hangzhou were in a state of panic, and there were more than 20,000 people crossing the river eastward every day. The river was turbulent and the ferries were crowded. Seeing this situation, I felt uneasy and knew that the construction of this bridge had been proposed twenty years ago. However, it was suspended due to the magnitude of the project and the difficulty of construction. Some superstitious people even said that the Qiantang River had no bottom and could not be bridged. However, this kind of rumor does not conform to scientific principles. Driven by a sense of responsibility and curiosity, we tried to measure it. Around mid-June of last year, we tried driving four-inch steel rods five times, breaking four of them. At first, repeated failures almost made the employees believe in the superstitious rumors, but finally, we succeeded. The riverbed is mostly rock, making drilling very difficult, but we finally drilled more than 140 feet, shattering the superstitious rumors at once. The preparation for the construction of the railway bridge also proceeded actively. Initial estimates were that it would cost six to ten million, but considering its importance, we did not hesitate to submit a proposal to the provincial government, requesting the opinion of the chairman and all committee members. Former Finance Director Zhou Junyan was the strongest advocate, willing to take full responsibility for raising funds. The financial community was very supportive, and gentlemen from Zhejiang such as Zhang Jingjiang and Chen Aishi also gave strong encouragement, so this proposal was accepted. A preparatory committee was organized, raising two million yuan in one fell swoop. At that time, Chairman Ye of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, seeing the 20-year hope realized in one fell swoop, even visited and inquired, and ran around to make connections, providing a lot of assistance. The provincial government shouldered one million yuan, which was approved by the National Economic Commission to be borrowed. The Ministry of Railways shouldered 2.5 million yuan, which was borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund, totaling 5.5 million yuan, which is enough to meet the needs of the entire bridge construction. The drawings were decided after a long period of research. Bidding was invited in April this year, and the contract was recently signed, so a date was chosen to start construction. In total, the preparation time has been more than three years. It is estimated that the foundation project will take 400 days, and the bridge deck will take two months. The entire project is limited to completion in one year and four to six months. After the completion of this bridge, the impact will be that the two Zhe provinces can be connected, this is one. The Hangzhou-Jiangxi Road is now being extended to reach Nanchang and Pingxiang, and will even connect the Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, so the transportation in Jiangnan will take this bridge as a starting point and Hangzhou as the center, this is two. Hangzhou has beautiful scenery, famous all over the world. In the future, the two sides of the bridge will be lined with gardens, and the grandeur of the scenery will be embellished by the bridge and the Liuhe Pagoda, which will greatly enhance the charm of Hangzhou, this is three. I also hope that the responsible personnel will work hard to complete the project within the time limit, and I hope that all supporters will give guidance and assistance from time to time."</p>

<p>Preparatory Report</p>
<p>Then, Director Mao Yisheng of the Project Office reported on the preparation process, stating, "The design research and bidding process for the bridge have been recorded in the report booklet, which is briefly described as follows. The entire bridge has a total of sixteen spans, each span is 220 feet long, the total length is 3,520 feet, about twice the length of the Bai Causeway. The bridge foundation is deeper than the length of each span. The total construction cost is about 3.4 million to 3.6 million yuan. Now, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and the Zhejiang Provincial Highway have been completed and opened to traffic one after another, and urgently need this bridge to connect them. Therefore, the time limit is very short, and special efforts should be made to avoid delays. I also hope that leaders at all levels and people from all walks of life will supervise us from time to time. The inauguration of the railway bridge is appropriately held on the anniversary of the World War peace, which also has a profound meaning."</p>
<p>Directive from the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu was unable to attend due to illness. Counselor Xia Guangyu attended on his behalf and delivered a speech, saying, "The Qiantang River Bridge is the most important project of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. It was prepared for construction twenty years ago, and a decision was about to be made. Unfortunately, the sudden outbreak of the European War led to its suspension. The section of railway from Hangzhou to Cao Yao between Hangzhou and Ningbo was also temporarily suspended. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has not been completed to this day, which is a major regret. Now, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road is under active construction as the main east-west route south of the Yangtze River. In the future, it will connect Zhejiang and Jiangxi and reach Hunan Province to connect with Yuehan. In order to connect eastward with Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, so that Shanghai, the first commercial port of our country, can be connected with various parts of the south of the Yangtze River, we rely entirely on the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge. Therefore, its relationship, as far as the current situation is concerned, is not only the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Road, but also the transportation hub south of the Yangtze River. Its importance is self-evident. In recent years, the highways in Zhejiang Province have developed very rapidly, spreading vertically and horizontally, and the results are remarkable. However, the obstruction of the Qiantang River has prevented the connection between eastern and western Zhejiang. Therefore, both the railway and the highway on both sides of the Qiantang River urgently need a bridge to facilitate passage. The authorities in Zhejiang Province are aware of this and are engaged in preparing for the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge, especially Director Zeng Yangfu of the Construction Department, who has made the most efforts. Since the Zhejiang Province is promoting it, and the use of the bridge is closely related to the state-owned railway, it is believed that in all undertakings, the central government and local authorities should support each other and express the spirit of cooperation, which is the most excellent phenomenon in the country. Therefore, with this spirit, we work together to realize the construction of this bridge today. At the beginning of the inauguration ceremony, in terms of technology, this bridge adopts a dual-purpose design for railways and highways, with trains running on the lower level and highways and sidewalks on the upper level. It is the first of its kind among all railway bridges in the country. The design drawings have been reviewed by experts and modified many times before being finalized. In general, there should be no imperfections. If it is found that there are still areas to be considered during the construction process, Director Mao is a famous expert in engineering, and Chief Engineer Luo and Deputy Chief Engineer Whitehead, who are also engineering experts with rich experience, should work together to make sure there are no regrets and create a model for the future. The Kangyi Foreign Firm and the Daomenlang Foreign Firm have excellent reputations in terms of experience and credit. This time, they have contracted the bridge and steel beams separately. I hope that for the sake of maintaining their permanent reputation, they will be able to strictly comply with the contract conditions and drawing instructions and earnestly fulfill their obligations to ensure that the project is solid. The deadline for the completion of this bridge is very short. Representatives from Zhejiang Province and representatives from the Ministry of Railways have the responsibility to supervise the progress of the entire project. The director of the project office is responsible for overseeing all the works. During the construction of this bridge project, he should supervise it at any time. The key is to ensure that the project does not delay step by step, and then the entire project can be completed on time. As the saying goes, the beginning is the foundation of success. Therefore, at the beginning of the inauguration ceremony, the minister expresses his deep hope."</p>
<h3>Groundbreaking for the Qiantang River Railway Bridge</h3>
<p>— (Photo by Wang Kai)</p>
<p>Chairman Lu's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Lu's directive was read on his behalf by Zhang Heng, Chief of the Second Section of the Provincial Government. The original text reads, "The government's construction of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge has been planned for a long time and is now ready. Today, we are holding the inauguration ceremony, and honored guests from China and abroad have come to grace us with their presence. Their enthusiasm for assistance is truly appreciated beyond measure. Zhejiang Province connects the southeast and serves as a screen for Beijing and Shanghai. The Qiantang River is separated by a body of water, and the two Zhe provinces, east and west, take it as a natural boundary. The lower reaches of the river pass through Hangzhou City. The water surface is vast, and travelers have long felt inconvenience. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is thus interrupted and cannot be connected by rail. The Hangzhou-Jiangxi Railway winds down and stops at the river. Passengers and goods rely on boats for transportation. The province's more than 3,000 kilometers of highways are also blocked by the river and cannot be connected. This is only in one corner. In terms of national transportation relations, after the construction of Yuping Road, the Hangzhou-Jiangxi Road will become the trunk line of the southeastern system. The highways, such as Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou, have already been opened to traffic. The Hangzhou-Guangdong and Hangzhou-Fujian roads are under construction and will connect Zhanggong in the west and Bamin in the south, becoming the trunk line of seven provincial highways. If this bridge is not built, the railways and highways between the two Zhe provinces will be blocked by the river and cannot fully exert their effectiveness. Therefore, for the sake of the political, cultural, and economic development of Zhejiang Province, and for the sake of national transportation and national defense, it is necessary to complete this bridge in a timely manner. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, the government has repeatedly made concessions on building bridges, but due to the magnitude of the project, the discussions have been suspended. Now, with the leadership of the Yuan and the military leaders, and with the hard work of Director Zeng, we can start construction. After the completion of the bridge, it will enable Zhejiang's political, cultural, and economic development to make great progress due to the connection of the two Zhe provinces. It will also enable national defense and military affairs to obtain great convenience. Like the human body, the blood vessels have suffered from stagnation. Once they are fully connected, the physical strength will be healthy and strong. This can be asserted. Although the bridge project cannot be compared with the iron bridges in the world, it is in the first place in China. Although the Yellow River Bridge has a longer diameter and larger holes, it only passes trains. This bridge allows railways, highways, and pedestrians to pass at the same time. Its scale is great, and the project is perfect, it can be said to be unique for a time. Dipin is in charge of Zhejiang's politics and is honored to be here. From today onwards, all employees must work hard to make China's first combined railway and highway bridge appear as soon as possible, adding a unique color to the history of transportation in our country. This is not only the fortune of Zhejiang Province."</p>
<p>Director Zeng's Speech</p>
<p>Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming of the Ministry of Railways said in his speech, "Today, I came to Hangzhou from Beijing to attend the inauguration ceremony of the Qiantang River Bridge. I am very happy. In today's world, the importance of transportation is known to all. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is not only the only major trunk line in Zhejiang, but also a very important route in the five southeastern provinces. In the past, Director Zeng and Director Zeng came to Beijing to talk about the importance of the Qiantang River and planned to complete this bridge in cooperation with the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang Provincial Government. I expressed my deep sympathy. With the efforts of all parties, especially Director Zeng's meticulous planning, we can hold the inauguration ceremony here today. After the construction starts, it can be completed in one and a half years. The completion of this bridge is of great importance in politics, national defense, transportation, and economy. Therefore, we must make 20 points of effort to complete this road quickly. Minister Gu originally planned to come to participate in the grand ceremony, but he was unable to attend due to poor health. He has instructed Counselor Xia to come and participate on his behalf. We deeply admire Director Zeng's efforts in the construction cause, the progress of Zhejiang's transportation and other construction causes, which has benefited politics and economy greatly. All this is due to Director Zeng."</p>
<p>Guests' Speeches</p>
<p>(1) Chen Aishi, Minister of Accounting of the National Government, said in his speech, "I am originally from Zhejiang and serve in the central government. I am here today to participate in the grand ceremony and I am very willing to have the qualifications of the people of Zhejiang. When I first came into the world, I regretted that the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Road was blocked by the Qiantang River and could not be connected. It has been more than thirty years since then. In the past, it can be said that it was only a dream. Today, I am waking up from the dream. The Qiantang River will start to build a bridge from today. The preparation situation of the bridge has been reported in detail by Director Zeng, and there is no need for me to repeat it. However, if the responsible persons of the government and the sincere support of people from all walks of life had not worked hard to prepare, there would be no today. In the future, I hope that all relevant parties will work harder to complete it as scheduled. After this road can be connected, it will not only be much more convenient in terms of transportation, but also at the time of rural bankruptcy, it will rely on the convenience of transportation to make up for the shortage of those who have surplus production. Adjusting production is a good plan. I deeply believe that all undertakings should be a manifestation of strength for all citizens. The success of this bridge depends on the help of the people. I hope that the people of Zhejiang Province can encourage each other." (2) Wang Tingyang, member of the Zhejiang Provincial Supervisory Committee, said in his speech, "Director Zeng and Director Chen have given detailed reports on the construction preparation process and its significance of the Qiantang River Bridge. What I want to say is the history of the road. Thirty years ago, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway had been started by the Jiangzhe Railway Company. However, due to the vastness of the Qiantang River, the road line was blocked. At that time, some people advocated that the line should be built along the river to the upper reaches and raised shares to carry it out. Later, the bureau was reorganized to manage all the road lines east and west of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Road Bureau, which have been completed one after another. However, the matter of crossing the river has not been resolved. Now, the provincial government and the Ministry of Railways have carefully planned and completed the bridge construction plan and started construction today. This great project will benefit the people of Zhejiang, and it will not be a trivial matter." (3) Hu Wenhu said in his speech, "Today is the inauguration ceremony of the Qiantang River Bridge. I have traveled across the ocean and have not returned to China for a long time. I am very happy and honored to take this opportunity to return to China and participate in this grand ceremony. We, who are far away in foreign countries, look forward to our motherland becoming stronger and stronger every day. To become stronger, the first step is to revitalize the countryside, and transportation is of great importance to rural revitalization. Now that the authorities are able to build this bridge, the people of Zhejiang will benefit greatly on the day of completion. All overseas Chinese express their full support for this great project and hope that the authorities in other provinces can follow this spirit and engage in the great cause of agricultural revitalization, and congratulate the motherland on its rapid progress in construction." (4) Pusbei, director of the Central Company, said in his speech, "The Central British Company's investment in the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is based on the spirit of Sino-British cooperation. This time, the authorities of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, in order to complete the road, this company and the China Construction Bank jointly invested to see it through. I have done some research on bridge construction projects, so I know that the progress of the bridge project is not easy. The Chinese authorities can start construction today with a resolute spirit, and I can congratulate the future of China's construction." (5) Shou Yicheng, Deputy Manager of the Hangzhou Branch of the Bank of China, said in his speech, "The Qiantang River Bridge has reached where it is today, and it is impossible not to praise Director Zeng's resoluteness in doing things. I am in Hangzhou and I know that there must be remedial measures for the Qiantang River in transportation. Therefore, I express my sympathy for this matter and I am willing to promote its realization within the scope of my ability. A Japanese and Director Zeng and others talked about this matter after a banquet. According to Director Zeng, there are many people crossing the Qiantang River and there are not enough ferries, and there are people sleeping on both sides of the river. Moreover, the river surface is vast, and it is very dangerous to cross the river. Therefore, the construction of the bridge is urgent. I then discussed this matter with Manager Jin and went to Shanghai with Director Zeng to discuss borrowing money with the bank manager. I went to Shanghai with Director Zeng and Director Zeng to discuss borrowing money with the banking group. At first, the Shanghai banking group said that the construction of the Huangpu Bridge has been sung for a long time, but it has not been realized, and they regarded the Qiantang River Bridge as not as urgent as the Huangpu Bridge. After Director Zeng and I repeatedly explained and obtained explanations from all parties, the banking group agreed. Now that the bridge has started construction, the government and the people are cooperating with each other, making the completion of the great project not a small achievement." (6) Cai Zhengya, representative of the China Construction Bank, said in his speech, "The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has a long history. The road is one of the five major trunk lines in China. In the 26th year of Guangxu, it was contracted by merchants and first built from Shanghai to Hangzhou, which was completed in the 34th year of Guangxu. It was completed from Cao'e River to Ningbo from the 2nd to the 3rd year of Xuantong. The entire line is 177 kilometers long. According to the report in the last three years, the average annual revenue is 7.5 million yuan. The population along the way is 5.5 million people. In terms of economy, Zhejiang is rich in products. Paper making covers 43 counties. Cotton cloth is almost in every county. Other products such as bamboo and cotton are also very abundant. However, it is important that the products are circulated, and transportation must be convenient. The authorities built the Qiantang River Bridge this time. In the bridge itself, the Prime Minister has mentioned it in the Southeast Railway System of the Industrial Plan. However, due to the magnitude of the project and the huge cost, the inauguration ceremony is being held today. The largest bridge project in China is the Yellow River Railway Bridge. In addition, this bridge should be the first. When the Southeast Expo was held last year, there were proposals to build tunnels or floating bridges, but at that time, it was still an ideal. Now, it has become a reality from an ideal. In terms of the scope of Zhejiang, the separation of eastern and western Zhejiang can be connected in the future, and it can reach north and south. In recent years, the Ministry of Railways has held exhibitions of products along the line in various roads, so in the future, Zhejiang's local products will have great help in transportation. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the government authorities' efforts in highways and railways have given the people great benefits. I cannot but congratulate the future of China."</p>
<h3>Inauguration Ceremony for Starting Pile Driving of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge</h3>
<p>— (Photo by Wang Kai)</p>
<p>Inauguration Ceremony</p>
<p>The conference was held from 10 a.m. The chairman's report and guests' speeches took more than an hour. At 11:15 a.m., the inauguration ceremony began. The guests gathered in front of the commemorative tablet. Ms. Feng Xiaoyun, wife of Director Zeng, unveiled it. Amidst the military music, the national flag covering the tablet was slowly removed. Director Zeng stood behind the tablet and placed the prepared center point needle on the back of the tablet. There was also a cornerstone on the east bank of the river. This center point was to straighten the railway bridge. After the ceremony, the guests were led by the military band to the shore. Vice Minister Zeng and Director Zeng went to the Qiantang River. They walked to the pontoon bridge, which was temporarily built. The pontoon bridge was parked at the first pier. There was a flag inserted there, which read "First Pier of the Qiantang River Bridge." The pontoon bridge had an engine room and a crane pile driver. After Vice Minister Zeng and others arrived on the boat, they went to the engine room. There was an iron ring in the machine, hanging on the horizontal axis of the machine. The iron ring was tied with red silk. First, Vice Minister Zeng's wife and Director Zeng and his wife and others performed the ceremony in turn. At this time, bamboo explosions and high-rise buildings were released on the bow, and the sound of the machine was rustling. The crane had also turned, moving the wooden pile to the first pier, and then using the pile driver to drive the wooden pile into the water. Vice Minister Zeng and others left the boat to the shore and each held a hoe and shovel to dig the soil as a ceremony amidst the military music. The ceremony ended and the meeting was adjourned. It was already past 12:00 p.m. and the recruiters invited all the guests to the Zhakou Liuhe Pagoda in the northwest of the venue. The Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang Provincial Government hosted a banquet to entertain the guests. The meeting ended at about 2 p.m. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army in the Northeast Implements Opium Monopoly</h3>
<p>The Opium Policy is Becoming Increasingly Fierce</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: The Changchun "Opium Retail Union Office" has, since the Japanese and puppet regimes implemented an opium monopoly, become something that cannot be compared to the past when secret sales were profitable. Furthermore, in order to strictly implement the "monopoly policy" and facilitate control, it convened all the same businesses and decided on the wholesale prices of so-called "raw opium" and "prepared opium," in order to unify the entire city. It has already notified all retailers in the city to comply with it from November 1st. The price list is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Raw Opium (Unit: Yuan)</p>
<p>Monopolist Wholesale Point Retail Point</p>
<p>East Special Grade 3.45 3.75 4.05</p>
<p>East First Grade 3.20 3.45 3.79</p>
<p>East Second Grade 2.95 3.18 3.49</p>
<p>East Third Grade 2.65 2.86 3.14</p>
<p>East Fourth Grade 2.25 2.42 2.67</p>
<p>East Fifth Grade 1.75 1.89 2.07</p>
<p>Outside Grade 0.95 1.01 1.12</p>
<p>West Special Grade 2.80 3.02 3.32</p>
<p>West First Grade 2.60 2.80 3.08</p>
<p>West Second Grade 2.30 2.48 2.72</p>
<p>West Third Grade 2.00 2.16 2.27</p>
<p>West Fourth Grade 1.60 1.72 1.89</p>
<p>West Fifth Grade 1.20 1.29 1.41</p>
<p>Outside Grade 0.60 0.64 0.70</p>
<p>(2) Prepared Opium Prices</p>
<p>Inside Establishment Outside Establishment</p>
<p>Four Fen 0.20 0.25</p>
<p>Three Fen One Li 0.15 0.20</p>
<p>Furthermore, a certain Japanese ronin who specializes in selling narcotics on Siping Street came here to negotiate opium retail matters. According to his talk, after Siping Street received the circular from the Opium Monopoly Office, it greatly reduced the prices of various types of opium. However, Persian opium remains the same. First-grade Western opium, originally priced at 3.40 yuan per tael, has now fallen to 2.81 yuan. Second-grade Western opium, originally priced at 3.18 yuan, has now fallen to 2.48 yuan, including shipping costs. In total, each tael has been reduced by 60-70 cents, which is a significant reduction. However, for the retailers, it is somewhat harsh because the profit from retailing four-fen opium bubbles was already very small, and the expenses were very high, so they all suffered losses. Currently, each retailer is personally leading the operation, and they have petitioned to change the retail price of opium bubbles to 3.6 li, but they have not yet received approval from the Office. At this time when the price of raw opium is falling, if the Office approves, then retailers may be able to obtain considerable profit. According to the above, it is even more apparent that the Japanese are scheming in our Northeast. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Guizhou Provincial Government Sets Up Student Loans for Impoverished Students</h3>
<p>Annual Appropriation of 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>To Aid Impoverished Students</p>
<p>Nanning Correspondence: The provincial government has recently been quite concerned about educational facilities. However, Guizhou Province is a barren place, and the students' families are mostly not wealthy. There are those who are dedicated to learning but cannot advance, and there are those who drop out halfway. In order to aid these impoverished students so that they can achieve their aspirations and become talented individuals, the provincial government has decided to allocate 100,000 yuan from the provincial treasury annually as student loans. It has drafted regulations, submitted them to the 152nd committee meeting of the provincial government for discussion, and promulgated them for implementation. The measures are as follows: (1) All self-funded students from this province who are attending national, provincial, or private specialized schools and above approved by the Ministry of Education, as well as self-funded students from this province who are attending famous specialized schools and above abroad, may apply for student loans. (2) The student loans will be allocated from the provincial education budget at 100,000 yuan of national currency per year, with 60% for those inside and outside the province and 40% for those abroad. The distribution of quotas and loan standards will be determined separately. (3) Students applying for student loans should submit two recent 4.5-inch photos, proof of enrollment, transcripts, resumes, etc., and list the names of three generations, which should be submitted through their schools or overseas study management organizations (embassy or student affairs office supervisor) to the Guangxi Provincial Government for forwarding to the county government of the student's origin for verification to confirm that the family is indeed poor and unable to afford their tuition fees.

<h3>Shantou Counterfeit Merchant Treasury Bonds Case Cracked</h3>
<p>Several Main Culprits Arrested</p>
<p>Merchant Treasury Bonds are Re-printed</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The financial chaos in Chaozhou and Shantou was actually caused by the discovery of counterfeit merchant treasury bonds on the market. The Finance Department approved the issuance of 10 million yuan of merchant treasury bonds to relieve the financial situation in Chaozhou and Shantou, each bond worth 100 yuan. Silver shops and merchants registered their real estate in the city as collateral to obtain the bonds. A committee was formed by the Chamber of Commerce, the Silver Industry Association, and the Exchange Association, with Chen Jingqing as the chairman. Unexpectedly, on September 15th, counterfeit merchant treasury bonds suddenly appeared on the market. The Merchant Treasury Bond Committee initially did not recognize that they were fake and even sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, announcing to the citizens with gongs that they should not refuse to accept them. At the same time, a reward of 5,000 yuan was offered to capture those who spread rumors and disrupted the financial situation. By the 17th, the Merchant Treasury Bond Committee suddenly claimed that they were indeed fake and temporarily announced to the citizens to bring the treasury bonds to the Chamber of Commerce for identification. Genuine ones would be stamped and circulated as usual, while fake ones would be stamped and invalidated. The Bank of Taiwan pointed out that the genuine and fake treasury bonds were printed from the same plate and ordered the Merchant Treasury Bond Committee to be responsible for the Bank's acceptance of the fake bonds. Even if fake bonds were discovered in the Bank, they could not be stamped and invalidated. This matter was of great importance and attracted the attention of all the people in Chaozhou and Meizhou. Fortunately, only more than 3.8 million yuan of treasury bonds were used in the market. After a month, the identification was completely completed. Many merchants who mistakenly accepted the bonds were willing to suffer the losses in secret. However, by the end of last month, the counterfeit treasury bond organization was suddenly cracked. A certain important person in the Merchant Treasury Bond Committee hurriedly left Shantou. Those arrested in Shantou included Lin Jinru, the manager of Datong Hotel on Zhi Ping Road. Kwong Jiesan, Kwong Sheng, Kwong Jingzhong, and others, the main culprits, were arrested in Guangzhou by telegram. A Chaozhou native named Lin Junqi was also arrested. At the same time, counterfeit treasury bonds and the original plate worth 1 million yuan were seized, of which 90,000 yuan were reportedly used in the market. Currently, all the above-mentioned criminals are detained in the East District Pacification Commissioner's Office and are being interrogated closely. Zhou Jianhou, the owner of Jian Yuan Zhuang on Zhen Ping Road in Shantou, is currently a city councilor and is usually prudent and honest. He has considerable property in Shantou. After this case was discovered, he was also implicated. Now, relatives and friends are not allowed to visit him. It is heard that the content is complex and involves many people of reputation. The authorities also prohibited publication because the case is of great importance.</p>
<p>The Shantou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, because the treasury bonds are counterfeit, urgently needs to re-print them and recover the previously issued bonds. After completing negotiations with the Xinhua Company in Hong Kong, 10 million yuan will be printed, divided into four types: 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 30 yuan, and 20 yuan, totaling 350,000 bonds. The plate-making and printing costs are set at 31,000 yuan. The entire printing work is moved to the hall of the Shantou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Guo Yingmu, Yu Haishan, and Huang Jingchu are elected to supervise the printing. A blank line is reserved on the treasury bond face for the account holders to add a style stamp and jointly bear responsibility, so that the scope is different. In case of counterfeit bonds, it will not affect the finance of the whole Chaozhou and Meizhou. (November 5)</p>
<h3>New Sui Traffic Restored</h3>
<p>Long-Distance Bus Reaches in Ten Days</p>
<p>Capital Increased by Over One Million Yuan</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The long-distance bus from Suiyuan to Xinjiang has been restored on the first of this month. For the convenience of handling affairs, the New Sui Long-Distance Bus Company still has its head office in Tianjin. Currently, due to the restoration of traffic, five buses are temporarily prepared to depart from Suiyuan, with Hami in Xinjiang as the terminal, which can be reached in ten days. Zhu Xiting, the manager of the Tianjin head office, told the press about the company's organizational status and future plans, generally stating that the company's initial capital was 300,000 yuan. The first test run encountered the Xinjiang war, and the business was suspended. The gas stations along the route suffered particularly heavy losses due to the looting by soldiers and bandits. Nearly half of the 300,000 capital was lost. Now that the new unrest has been pacified, traffic can be restored. After the company negotiated with the Xinjiang authorities and obtained permission, it began to restore operations and had to raise additional funds to increase the capital to one million yuan due to the nearly exhausted past funds, adding 40 new buses. It is planned that in the future, each period will start from Suiyuan and Xinjiang once each. Starting from the 15th of this month, the formal traffic will begin. The company selects twelve buses with excellent machinery to depart from Suiyuan to Hami in turn. Currently, it is temporarily scheduled to run once a week to test the road's goodness and whether there are other difficulties. The gas stations and inns along the way have been renovated one month ago. If there are no other accidents, the bus can run smoothly. The issue of transporting mail has been contracted by the company with the Hebei Provincial Post Office, stipulating that each kilogram of mail will be charged four cents within 100 kilometers, and will be increased when exceeded. Packages are temporarily not accepted. As for selling tickets to carry passengers, it is handled by the Suiyuan general station, and China Travel Service also intends to handle it and is still in consultation. Sheng Shicai, the governor of Xinjiang, has provided considerable assistance to this restoration of traffic, but because the local order has not been fully restored, the Sui-Xin bus cannot directly reach Dihua. The section from Hami to Dihua is connected by the Xinjiang Provincial Long-Distance Bus, and a contract is signed separately. This section can be reached in about three days. Since the war in Xinjiang, both materials and talents have been lacking. With the New Sui Long-Distance Bus to connect it, the west may be able to achieve civilization earlier and rank among the major cities in the country. (6th)</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>National Exhibition Dispute Resolved</p>
<p>Guo Hua businessman Sun Zicheng, etc. initiated the organization of a National Goods Mobile Exhibition. More than 80 manufacturers from Suzhou and Shanghai participated. It opened on the 10th and will last for three weeks. However, more than 200 merchants in the Guanjian Street area strongly opposed it because their business was at stake. They have repeatedly petitioned the party and government agencies and the county chamber of commerce, requesting that the event be stopped. However, various agencies did not want to oppose the promotion of national goods, so the dispute lasted for many days without any result. Now, Sun, a special commissioner of the party department, has ordered the mobile exhibition to be shortened by one week for the sake of both parties, and the Guanjian Street stores may hold a large sale to compete.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>National Salvation Association Staff Corruption Exposed</p>
<p>The local National Salvation Association seized five pieces of inferior yarn of Xu Ri brand from Zhenxin Cloth Factory a month ago, totaling more than 300 packages. Unexpectedly, the owner of the goods suddenly asked someone to dredge up the National Salvation Association staff, offering 500 yuan to redeem the yarn. Wei Zhizhong, the general affairs and clerk of the association, colluded with the owner of the goods and changed the resolution of valuation and punishment to be that it was not inferior goods after inspection and approved the return. He also colluded with Liu Mingkui, a staff member of the association, and Wu Zhenji, a custodian, to secretly transport and return the five pieces of inferior goods. At the same time, Liu Mingkui held 65 yuan and a record book to the committee member Jiang Bosen, requesting a signature, and forged a resolution of release. Jiang was furious when he heard this and immediately reported it. Liu was twisted into the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the local branch court the day before. After the interrogating by the prosecutor Lian, Liu was ordered to pay 300 yuan in cash bail, but he was detained because there was no bail. Currently, the members of the National Salvation Association have also presented a report to the county party department requesting a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Petition to the Provincial Department to Universally Reduce Land Tax</p>
<p>The county government of this county believes that the autumn survey this year has been clearly re-surveyed by the hall. However, Article 7 of the Provincial Government's amendment to the Jiangsu Provincial Survey Report on Disaster Relief states that if there are a few maps in the county's territory, all or more than two-thirds of the fields in the entire map are indeed without harvest, they should be fully exempted, etc. After examining the situation of the bestowed county, if this restriction is followed, the exemption is equal to lip service, and the disaster victims have suffered losses in labor and capital. In the state of poverty and displacement, they are still required to complete 70-80% of the land tax according to the general practice of universal reduction. The legal facts are too far apart, how can they avoid repercussions? Even if they reluctantly obey, they will only resist and complete the increased civil debt. Those who have a good harvest this year can reach 80-90%, and those who are affected by the disaster not only have no harvest, but also suffer heavy losses. Comparing the two, the gains and losses are like heaven and earth. Although Xiyi has had poor harvests in previous years, there has been no reduction or exemption, and all have been collected in full. If the general reduction is followed this year, it is definitely not something that can be done by the facts. Yesterday, the provincial government was specially presented, requesting to look at the disaster situation and not be restricted, and to check and approve the proposed settlement. At the same time, the Finance Department was also presented, requesting that the issue of taxation still be based on the principle of universal reduction.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>

<p>After the three raw opium shops of Tongsheng, Yongsheng, and Xiecheng in this county were issued licenses by the provincial capital, Wang Yuanzhi and Cheng Zude were sent to the province to purchase 6,000 taels of official raw opium. It was transferred from the town to Jiangyin on the 6th and arrived at the port at 3 pm.

Now, the shops have officially opened on the 8th, and the opium shops and smoking places have also opened at the same time.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>Brother and Sister Commit Adultery and Abortion, Resulting in Death</p>
<p>In Pujizhen, Fourth District, Yuan Fengbiao's daughter, Mei Bao, is 19 years old this year. In August of this year, she was seduced and impregnated by her clan brother Yuan Bangxiang. Mei Bao was afraid of being found out, so she secretly discussed abortion with Bangxiang the day before (7th). Unexpectedly, after taking the medicine, she had severe abdominal pain and blood flowed straight. The fetus did not come down, and she died the next day (8th). Fengbiao found out the truth and was extremely angry. Yesterday (9th), he presented a request to the county government to send a staff member to investigate and handle the case.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Qing Huo Ban's Various Ships Detained</p>
<p>Shiyanggou Bridge in Dongxiang, a county area, is a necessary route for transportation between Yangxian (Xiannvzhen). Its bridge piers are often damaged by Qing Huo Ban's ships. Once the bridge pier is broken, the land transportation will be greatly affected. In the past half month, the Datong No. 1 small ship of the Dada Company destroyed five bridge piers, which had just been repaired. Then, the barge of the Datong Company destroyed three bridge piers again. Yao Maoshun, the custodian, was taken to the county for detention. Because the bridge piers of the bridge were often broken, Magistrate Ma believed that the small ships could not travel until the bridge was repaired and consolidated. Although it was repeatedly stopped, the companies did not comply. Recently, Magistrate Ma ordered the Sixth Substation of the Shaobo Public Security Bureau to detain the Xia Shui Xintai Zhou Gongxing two small ships of Dada Company and the Xia Shui Renhe small ship of Datong Company on the night of the 8th due to the request of the people in the Xiannvmiao area, and the First Branch of the Xiannvmiao Public Security Bureau detained the Dada Company's Shangshui Datong No. 1 small ship on the afternoon of the 9th. Therefore, the companies began to send telegrams to various companies along the Qing Huo route, stopping selling tickets and starting ships, and at the same time, they telegraphed the Shanghai head office to ask people to persuade them, planning to have the companies invest in repairing the bridge completely. As for sacrificing the route, it is feared that it is impossible in fact.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor:</p>
<p>After reading the Haimen correspondence column on page nine of your newspaper on November 8, the telegram of the Haimen Beijing Fellow Association opposing the opening of the Tongsha River is inconsistent with the facts. In the early years of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang Jian proposed a plan for the Tongsha River with eight or nine gates and culverts, with both advantages and disadvantages. The people of Haimen had their own reasons for opposing it. The current proposal is only to open the river without building sluices along the route, which is different from the previous plan. It is only a proposal to allocate disaster relief funds in exchange for work, and there is no specific plan. Juenong has stated that he will no longer be involved. Fearing that the distant rumors are false, I specially ask your newspaper to publish them in the letter column for correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Tan Juenong, Construction Section, Haimen County Government, November 10</p>

However, the banking circles in Hangzhou believed that the amount was too large and all needed to consult with banks in Shanghai, so no concrete decision has been made so far. A few days ago, Wang took the opportunity to come to Shanghai to meet with the standing committee members of the A-Xu Drought Relief Committee to discuss disaster relief matters in the province, and consulted with the authorities of various banks such as China in order to establish it as soon as possible to cope with the current difficulties.

Therefore, in order to maintain daily expenses, the Association specially requested Kong Xiangxi, the Minister of Finance, by telegram through Vice Presidents Xu Shiying, Wang Zhengting, Wang Zhen, etc., to sell the American wheat flour to the Famine Relief Association at the preferential price of the Ministry of Military Affairs. It is now learned that after receiving the telegram, Minister Kong replied to Xu and others of the Association by telegram yesterday, stating, "American wheat is of good quality and high price, which seems uneconomical for disaster relief. The price of American wheat has already been designated for use and cannot be transferred at will. It is difficult to comply with your request. If you are concerned that the Association has no funds, I will find another way to raise them."</p>

<p>The women's circles convened a joint meeting at Wuben Women's School yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm because the provisions of Article 239 of the Criminal Law and Article 211, Paragraph 2 of Chapter 16 of the Civil Law violated the principle of equality between men and women. Representatives from the China Women's Society, Women's League, Women's Temperance Association, Women's Collaborative Advancement Association, etc., including Hu Ying, Chen Wanzhen, Lu Yun, Bu Zhenhua, Liu Yuli Ming (representing Chen Lingyi), Chen Lingyi, Qiu Xisheng, Yang Zhihao, Jin Guangmei, Wang Ruizhu, Liu Ping Jichen, Wen Gongsi, etc., more than twenty people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Yang Zhihao was elected as the chairman, and after the ceremony, the chairman reported that the recently amended Criminal Law by the Legislative Yuan reduced the age for considering sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of sixteen as rape to fourteen, which is detrimental to the health of women. Girls of fourteen years of age have not yet fully developed and are subjected to rape, which is enough to destroy their lifelong happiness. Furthermore, Article 239 of the Criminal Law stipulates that a married woman who commits adultery with someone shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year, and the adulterer shall also be subject to the same punishment. However, there are no provisions for married men. Women's circles in the capital have repeatedly opposed it. The Collaborative Advancement Association resolved at the board of directors to convene various groups to strive for it unanimously.</p>
<p>Meeting Situation</p>
<p>After discussion, it was generally believed that it was inappropriate for the Legislative Yuan to change the age from under sixteen to fourteen. Reading newspapers, the number of women who have been defiled is countless. The old law stipulates that the age is older, and there are still so many illegal situations. If it is changed to fourteen, it would be tantamount to giving men special convenience and indirectly enough to destroy the protection of the entire female sex. As for Article 239, which only limits women and neglects men, it gives men special rights, which is inappropriate.</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>As a result of the discussion, (1) on the issue of whether to organize a women's organization to strive for legal equality between men and women, it was resolved to retain it and convene a general meeting to establish it after the petition. (2) On the issue of whether to send more representatives from various groups to Beijing for the petition, it was resolved that each group would send representatives to petition voluntarily without forming a petition group. (3) The date of the petition is limited to going to Beijing before Wednesday to petition the Central Political Committee. The case has already been submitted to the Legal Group Committee for review and will be submitted to the Central Political Committee for approval and implementation. It was resolved to pass it.</p>

<p>Petition in Batches</p>
<p>The Women's Collaborative Advancement Association appointed Jin Guangmei, Qiu Xisheng, Yang Zhihao and other three representatives to take the Beijing-Shanghai train to Beijing at 11:00 pm last night, and planned to petition at the Central Party Headquarters' Memorial Week today. The Women's League has decided to send Liu Wang Liming, Chen Lingyi, Wang Ruizhu and other three people to Beijing today to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the National Government. The third batch of the China Women's Society is scheduled to go to Beijing tomorrow to petition. In addition, various women's groups such as the Women's Temperance Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, and the Young Women's Collaborative Association have all scheduled to send representatives to the Central Political Committee for a large-scale petition.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Discusses the Scope of Punishment for Adultery by Husband or Wife</h3>
<p>Taking the Laws of Various Countries as a Reference and Stipulating it in the Civil Law</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Article 239 of the Criminal Law draft recently passed by the Legislative Yuan stipulates that a married woman who commits adultery with someone shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year, and the adulterer shall also be subject to the same punishment. However, there is no provision for punishment for a married man who commits adultery with someone, which has aroused fierce protests from women's circles in Beijing and Shanghai. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Wang Chonghui, a world-renowned doctor of law, yesterday to inquire about his opinions on this issue. According to Dr. Wang, punishing a married woman who commits adultery with someone, but not punishing a married man who commits adultery with someone, is based on physiological reasons. The old laws of various countries a hundred years ago were all like this, and even today, three or four countries still follow it, and China is one of them. However, although this is based on physiological reasons, it does violate the principle of equality between men and women. However, the women's groups in Beijing and Shanghai this time requested that married men who commit adultery with someone should also be punished with the same crime, which is difficult to implement in practice. Because after this law is implemented, all those who take concubines are criminals. More than 30% of people in our country take concubines, so even if all the prisons in the country are used to imprison those married men who commit adultery, it would still be insufficient. I believe that married women or married men who commit adultery can be stipulated within the scope of the Civil Law and should not be regarded as criminals. The responsibility for punishment should be attributed to society and the cultivation of personal morality, academic research, and religious belief. The laws of most countries in the world are like this, and our country can also take it as a reference.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submitted its Opinions on the Registration Law to the Yuan and Ministry</h3>
<p>Please Adopt a Policy of Commercial Control</p>
<p>To Make the Organization of Groups More Strict</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Yuan and Ministry yesterday regarding the commercial registration law, requesting that the share-based system be maintained. The original text is recorded as follows: It is submitted for the matter of submitting a request. I, in accordance with Article 681 of the current Civil Law Debt Section, the provision that partnership debts are jointly and severally liable, is difficult to implement due to conflicts with the policy of legislative impartiality and the current economic situation of our country. We repeatedly submitted requests to your Yuan and the Legislative Yuan for amendments on March 10, 1933, and June 26 of the same year. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan of your Yuan replied to the Executive Yuan, stating that this case had been submitted for review and report and did not need to be amended. As for partnership organizations, a commercial registration law can be formulated separately as a remedy. The Secretariat of the Executive Yuan informed the relevant chambers of commerce accordingly. It is noted that the so-called formulation of a registration law as a remedy was proposed by Legislative Members Wu Kaixian, Zhao Chen, Liang Hancao, Cheng Zhonghang, Qu Zengze, Wu Jingxiong, Zhao Naichuan, Sheng Zhenwei, etc. The original proposal stated, "Based on this, I propose that in Article 681 of the Civil Law Debt Section, when the joint property is insufficient to pay off the partnership debts, each partner shall be jointly and severally liable for the insufficient amount. Add, but if the partnership has formally registered with the competent authority, each partner may be liable for losses according to the amount of shares they acknowledge." The so-called remedy is that once formally registered, the liability for losses based on the amount of shares acknowledged in the partnership agreement can be recognized and effective externally, and they will no longer be jointly and severally liable. According to the meaning of the word remedy and the meaning of the original proposal, it is very clear. The only difference in the Yuan's discussion from the original proposal is that this provision will not be added after Article 681 of the Civil Law, but a separate set of regulations will be formulated to remedy it. This approach was decided by the 33rd meeting of the Third Session of the Legislative Yuan of your Yuan and replied to the Executive Yuan. Therefore, the commercial registration law currently being drafted must be based on the original draft of the Yuan's discussion to ensure that the legislative purpose is consistent. Recently, Chen Zeqing and Luo Qinghua, the representatives of the subordinate association attending the meeting, brought the draft commercial registration law formulated by the Legislative Yuan of your Yuan. Article 9 of it states that the name, address, type and amount of capital contribution of the partner, who has been registered with the competent authority by the individual, shall be liable for the share of losses within the limit of his capital contribution, which is extremely consistent with the original intention of the remedy discussed at that time. We deeply sympathize with the difficulties of the business community and are very grateful. However, we have heard from the representatives that the Yuan and Ministry are still studying this provision, and we are deeply concerned that the differences in opinion may affect the establishment of the original case. We respectfully state our views again. The issue of partnership responsibility has been a case of dispute for more than twenty years. Joint and several liability is a precedent of the Daliyuan in the past and is not a common custom in the commercial market. According to commercial practice, there is only the example of sharing based on the contract agreement and the amount of shares. At that time, the chambers of commerce petitioned the judicial authorities for the precedent of joint and several liability, which is no less than today's dispute over joint and several liability. The documents are all there and can be reviewed. With joint and several liability, the creditor can choose one person to sue for the full amount. With joint liability, if it is assumed that five people are liable for a debt and three of them are wealthy, the creditor should separately pursue the full amount from the three. Other than this, there is no major difference. If three of the above five people are wealthy, then even if the creditor sues any one of the three for the full amount because of joint and several liability, it is not difficult for the one of the three who paid the full amount to negotiate with the other wealthy one to repay it. Then why should the merchants argue about the virtual name of joint and several liability? The method of commercial debts in our country has been followed since ancient times. Whenever the amount is insufficient to pay based on shares, either it is settled according to the percentage, or a certain amount is paid in cash, and the rest is paid back in installments. Merchants have long been at ease with it and no disadvantages have arisen. Recently, in operating partnership businesses, they often rely on one or two slightly wealthy people to call the shots, while other partners may take advantage of the situation to make up the numbers. By the time the business content is extremely empty, those who take advantage of the situation to make up the numbers may not attempt to remedy the situation, thinking they can get away with it and still share the profits. Even if something happens, the slightly wealthy will use all their property as a sacrifice. Joint and several liability is suitable for opening the door of convenience for those who take advantage of the situation. No wonder the social atmosphere is becoming more and more superficial and commercial ethics are not as good as before. If the system of sharing based on the amount of shares is strictly implemented, each partner has their own responsibility to fulfill. They will not be clever at trying beforehand, and they cannot shirk responsibility to the outside world afterward. If it is said that non-joint and several liability is not enough to protect creditors and enable them to enjoy the right of full repayment, the association has already stated in detail in the documents submitted to your Yuan and the Legislative Yuan twice last year, in March and June, that the state formulates laws and protects creditors and debtors equally in principle and should not be biased. Moreover, creditor rights and debts are only relative and not absolute. Often, the same natural person or legal person is a creditor in one place and a debtor in another, or invests in one place and invests in another at the same time. Sharing responsibility is easier to adjust and has less impact. Joint and several liability has more implications and is difficult to maintain. Moreover, people always think that investing in real estate involves a discount and the loss is only the invested real estate. This is a hundred times less dangerous than operating a partnership business. Anyone with a little thought will concentrate cash in the city and invest it all in real estate and public bonds. As a result, it is enough to promote the decline of inland commerce. This is why the entire national business community is calling for the current Civil Law's joint and several liability provisions to be remedied. When your Yuan and the Legislative Yuan decided to formulate a commercial registration law as a remedy, it was also for this reason. Those who criticize the share-based system of partnerships often say that the agreement is an internal contract and the names and addresses of the partners and the amount of their shares have not been announced to the outside world, making it easy to hide and fabricate when something happens. Therefore, this is the reason why partners should be jointly and severally liable. Now that the Yuan's discussion intends to formulate a commercial registration law separately, the above-mentioned shortcomings no longer exist. This is why the association wholeheartedly supports the smooth passage of Article 9 of the draft law and cannot help but speak in detail. When your (Legislative) Yuan was drafting the commercial registration law, Huang Youchang, a member of the committee, came to the association to consult on the opinions. The association copied and sent to member Huang the nine draft measures for partnership registration and withdrawal, in which it was stated that those with trade associations should be transferred by the trade associations, and those without trade associations should be directly transferred by the chamber of commerce. The second draft of the commercial registration law stipulated by the Legislative Yuan stipulates that the parties concerned should apply directly to the official agency. However, the reason why the association has this proposal is that it really sees that the trade associations and their affiliated stores are too far apart on weekdays, just like a plate of loose sand. Although Article 7 of the amended Trade Association Law stipulates that companies and firms in the same industry should join the association, the actual effect is still equal to zero. Therefore, it is intended to maintain its close relationship through the transfer of registration procedures. Moreover, partnership is the oldest and most common organization in Chinese business, and the situation is even more complicated than company registration. If the partners have ever lost property or credit, whether the amount of partnership shares they have reported has actually been received or not, if it is not verified and transferred by the trade association, how can the content be known? Recently, the issuance of certificates of national goods and the completion of the industrial and commercial survey forms for the machine-made foreign-style goods tax must be stamped and certified by the statutory industrial and commercial organizations. The partnership registration is even more important with regard to future rights and obligations, and it seems that there is no exception. In terms of the world's economic policy, commerce has shifted from laissez-faire to control. The so-called liberalism of the 19th century has long become a thing of the past. Although we cannot deliberately follow suit, the policy should also gradually evolve. If the trade associations and chambers of commerce have delayed or difficult situations in handling the registration procedures, the competent authorities can supervise them, and the commercial firms can appeal. The group itself turns to be closely related to the interests of the industry, and the organization becomes more strict and the association affairs are easier to rectify. This is another fool's view that partnership registration transferred by the trade association or chamber of commerce is beneficial to commerce and to industrial administration. I hope that it will be considered when your (Legislative) Yuan discusses and revises it and add the text of trade association or chamber of commerce review in Article 2 of the draft. All the results of the study of the commercial registration law draft by the subordinate association should be prepared in writing and submitted to your Yuan and Ministry for approval, and it is really convenient for the public to adopt and implement it. In addition to submitting it to the Ministry of Industry (Legislative Yuan) separately, it is hereby submitted to the Legislative Yuan (Ministry of Industry).</p>
<h3>The Hunan Drought Relief Committee Sent Representatives to Shanghai to Ask for Relief</h3>
<p>Cao Bowen, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Two Others Came to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>He Jian, the Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government and the Director of the Drought Relief Committee, due to the severe drought disaster in Hunan Province this year, with disaster areas almost all over the province, has earnestly requested the Central Government to issue 10 million yuan of disaster relief bonds and to return the province's rice and salt public shares of more than 7.4 million yuan. He also sent representatives Xie Xiaozhong and Su Xianyang, together with Cao Bowen, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the province, to Shanghai by boat with the chairman's letter. They went to the Shanghai Association for Raising Funds for Drought Relief in Various Provinces yesterday to meet with Kong Xiangxi and Xu Shiying, the presidents of the association. Since Presidents Kong and Xu were not in Shanghai, Huang Hanzhi and Qian Jingping, the standing directors, met with them on their behalf and promised to forward the request and find ways to provide relief. The representatives believed that the results were satisfactory and left with thanks. The original letter is recorded below: To Presidents Kong and Vice President Wang Xu of the Shanghai Association for Raising Funds for Drought Relief in Various Provinces, the drought disaster in Hunan Province this year is severe, with disaster areas almost all over the province. We have telegraphed for relief one after another. The disaster areas are in urgent need of relief. The financial resources of Hunan Province are limited. If we do not find a way to help early, we are deeply afraid of other events due to hunger and cold. Winter is approaching, which is very worrying. We earnestly request the Central Government to issue 10 million yuan of disaster relief bonds to be released and used for resettlement, and to return the public shares of rice and salt in Hunan Province of more than 7.4 million yuan for the construction of highways in Hunan Province. The development of transportation is also a form of relief through work. This is really killing two birds with one stone. We have sent Committee Members Xie Xiaozhong and Su Xianyang and Cao Bowen, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Hunan Province, to your office to petition. We respectfully request to be received and instructed. He Jian, Director of the Hunan Provincial Drought Relief Committee, Peng Guojun, Cao Bowen, Liu Ce Cheng, Lei Zhuhuan, Xiao Du, Peng Shi Di, Xiang Yujie, and others,</p>

<h3>Another Dispute Over Human-Powered Vehicles in the Special Zone; Application for New Vehicles and Demand for Licenses</h3>
<p>Opposition to Returning the Security Deposit</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the Public Concession Board of Works previously issued new regulations for human-powered vehicles in the Special Zone. Those who could comply with the regulations could obtain an application form to apply for a new vehicle. At that time, there were about 20,000 applicants, each paying a security deposit of five yuan, which was more than double the original amount. Later, because the old vehicle owners were able to comply, the original licenses could not be distributed. The applicants previously received a notice from the Bureau, setting a deadline to return the security deposit as a cancellation. The applicants believe that the Public Concession Board of Works has gone back on its word and lost its credibility. For this reason, an emergency meeting was held in Caojiadu on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The results of the discussion were: (1) To contact all applicants in the city to unanimously oppose the return of the security deposit; (2) To demand that the Public Concession Board of Works issue vehicle licenses in accordance with the regulations. They vowed not to give up until their goals are achieved.</p>

<h3>International Problems Research Association Publishes A History of the Partition of China's Borderlands</h3>
<p>The Narrative of the Borderlands Background is Very Detailed</p>
<p>Our country's land border, from the northeast to the southwest, is surrounded by the four powers of Japan, Russia, England, and France. All places have been under external pressure for a long time. Since the September 18th Incident, the four northeastern provinces have fallen, and other border areas have been affected by urgency at the same time. Therefore, there is the autonomous movement of Inner Mongolia, the establishment of the Islamic state of Xinjiang, the invasion of Xikang by the Tibetan army, and the disturbance of the Yunnan border, all of which have a bad background and cannot be regarded as local events. The International Problems Research Association in this port, in view of this, originally planned to compile a booklet on the diplomatic situation of the borderlands for the reference of the people of the country. Recently, reading the article "A History of the Partition of China's Borderlands" by Mr. Biesheng, director of the US Foreign Policy Discussion Association, it has originally and completely described the actual situation of our country's borderlands, the historical background, and the problems in the future. It is specially translated and printed into a book for the common research of the people of the country. The book has now been published and is priced at two cents. Those who are concerned about borderland issues can go to the International Problems Research Association at 59 Hong Kong Road to purchase and read it.</p>

<h3>Hexing Iron and Steel Plant Reorganized into Hexing Steelmaking Company</h3>
<p>Hexing Iron and Steel Plant, founded by Shanghai industrialists in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, produces excellent products, such as bamboo joint steel bars, which have been certified by the Shanghai British Public Works Bureau, the Chinese Institute of Engineers, and Wusong Tongji University. Due to the situation at that time, it was temporarily suspended. Now, it has been re-funded and reorganized into Hexing Faji Steelmaking Company, which has been greatly expanded and added equipment. Preparations have now been completed, and metallurgical experts (i.e., steelmaking engineers) have been hired to be responsible for the chemical refining project. The project is specifically preparing: (1) building steel bars of any length; (2) three-foot-long furniture hard steel for car knives and chisels; (3) machine casting steel for any size machine parts used in railway shipbuilding factories, machine factories, yarn factories, flour factories, etc. The above items can be cast in the same way. It is heard that the factory has been opened and the products are more exquisite than before. Purchasers from all over the country are very enthusiastic. It is really a good news for promoting domestic steel to save the country in the face of foreign goods dumping.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Government Builds a Municipal Hospital in the City Center</h3>
<p>And One Public Cemetery in Each of the Five Districts of East, South, West, North, and Central</p>
<p>In order to build Shanghai and the city center, the municipal government plans to establish a public cemetery in each of the five districts of East, South, West, North, and Central of the city to facilitate public funerals. It also allocates 400,000 yuan from the municipal bond funds to build a large municipal hospital in the city center. The two construction projects have been tendered by the Public Works Bureau separately and will be started within a few days. The Shin Times News reporter learned the details and recorded them separately.</p>
<p>Construction Location</p>
<p>The municipal government, in view of the increasing number of residents in the city center, must have a large hospital for citizens to seek medical treatment. Therefore, it decided to allocate 400,000 yuan from the municipal bond funds to build a municipal hospital with a health experimental institute attached. The construction site is west of Huayuan Road, east of Funan Zuo Road, south of Fudong Outer Road, and north of Qiujiang Road in the city center. The base is 80 acres, and the area occupied by the first phase of construction is 1,100 square meters. The Health Experimental Institute is built east of Huayuan Road, covering an area of about 530 square meters.</p>
<p>Internal Equipment</p>
<p>The construction of the municipal hospital is divided into five floors. The lower floor is the management office and outpatient clinic, the second floor is surgery, the third floor is special wards and obstetrics, the fourth floor is general wards, and the fifth floor is the dormitory and machine room. The style is simple, modern and does not lose the flavor of Chinese architecture. The interior is arranged according to the latest type of hospital, with 150 beds. All facilities are new and complete.</p>
<p>Scheduled Bidding</p>
<p>The Health Experimental Institute is a three-story steel and concrete building, 40 meters long and 15 meters wide. The exterior walls are made of artificial stone, and the style is also very simple. The hospital project is now being tendered by the Municipal Public Works Bureau. All registered construction factories or construction companies in the city should register with the bureau before the 15th of this month. After passing the review, they will bid. At the latest, construction will begin in early next month and is expected to be completed in the autumn of next year.</p>
<p>Building Public Cemeteries</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, in order to facilitate public funerals, has tendered for the construction of municipal cemeteries in the East, West, South, North, and Central districts of the city. The tender will be opened the day after tomorrow (the 14th), and construction will begin within the next week. It will be completed before the end of this year. In addition, it is planned to build a public cemetery in each of the East, West, North, and Central districts, which is currently being actively planned.</p>
<h3>The Funeral of Pan Hongsheng Held Yesterday in Solemnity</h3>
<p>The Procession Was Magnificent, and Many Attended to See Him Off</p>
<p>The Coffin Was Temporarily Placed in the Suzhou Guildhall in the South City</p>
<p>Patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng's funeral was held at 1:00 PM yesterday. The funeral arrangements were meticulously prepared by the funeral committee. The procession was grand. The authorities of the concessions were on high alert. The iron gates at the junction of the Chinese and French territories were completely closed. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Temporary Alert</p>
<p>The funeral committee of the martyr Pan Hongsheng issued a notice to all merchants and citizens, requesting them to lower flags to half-mast in mourning. The funeral arrangements were also announced. The authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, for precautionary measures, implemented a special temporary alert. From 12:00 PM yesterday, the Public Concession police temporarily dispatched additional Chinese and Western detectives to be stationed in the Avenue Edward VII area, with the Great World being the most heavily guarded. The French Concession police dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives, starting in the morning, to be on high alert at the junction of the Chinese and French territories on Rue de la République, Nanyang Bridge, and Route de Zikawei.</p>
<h3>Martyr Pan Hongsheng's Portrait</h3>
<p>Traffic Blocked</p>
<p>From 12:00 PM in the morning, at the junction of the Chinese and French territories on Rue de la République, citizens stood on the road, crowding to watch the funeral procession of martyr Pan. The crowd became increasingly dense from 1:00 PM in the afternoon. The French Concession police immediately closed one section of the iron gates at the junction of the Chinese and French territories, cutting off traffic, leaving only the small door on the sidewalk open. As a result, streetcars No. 5 and No. 6 of the two French companies could only go as far as Xiaobeimen. Streetcar No. 3 of the Chinese and French companies was also blocked. Trolley buses No. 17 and No. 18 were rerouted to Route H Lafayette. Trolley buses No. 14, No. 15, No. 16, and No. 17 were rerouted to Avenue Edward VII. The Ximen branch and the Shiliupu branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, as well as various police stations, also dispatched armed police to defend. The French police's mobile patrol unit also fully deployed. The strictness of the alert was unprecedented.</p>

<p>Magnificent Procession</p>
<p>The coffin of martyr Pan departed from the funeral home on Fangxie Road at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. The procession was magnificent, with many pallbearers. It proceeded from Fangxie Road to Daji Road, Xiaoximen, along Zhonghua Road, passing Xiaonanmen, Dadongmen, Xiaodongmen, then along Rue de la République, passing Xinbeimen, Laobeimen, Xiaobeimen, Laoximen, and finally to the Suzhou Guildhall in the South City for temporary placement. The number of citizens along the route watching the funeral procession was no less than tens of thousands. Traffic was cut off wherever it passed. Traffic only resumed after a long time. The iron gates at the junction of the Chinese and French territories were also opened. The armed detectives of the Chinese Concession then began to withdraw.</p>
<h3>The China National Manufacturers Association Plans to Raise Relief Funds for the Drought in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Intends to Open a Temporary Market to Donate a Percentage of Profits for Relief</p>
<p>A Letter Sent to the Jiaxu Disaster Relief Association Seeking Agreement</p>
<p>The China National Manufacturers Association, due to the severe drought in Zhejiang Province this year, believes that raising a large sum of relief money is necessary to rescue the victims. It plans to open a temporary market to promote domestic goods while donating a percentage of the market's business income for relief. Yesterday, it sent a letter to Chu Huiseng, chairman of the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, seeking agreement. The original letter is recorded below: (Omitted above) Dear Sir, Water and drought are disasters, a heavenly calamity for China. Soliciting donations for relief is an urgent task. Your association's organization of the Jiaxu Association to relieve the victims of Zhejiang Province has spread a reputation of benevolence, admired by all. However, emergency relief fundraising requires a large-scale campaign to be truly effective. In view of this, our association plans to launch a temporary market to support relief with domestic goods. We request that your association find a way to borrow the open space opposite the Great World on the west side of the French Concession to build the market. We have learned that the open space is the property of Mr. Zhang Danru. We know that Mr. Zhang is enthusiastic about charity. If your association agrees to intercede, Mr. Zhang will surely approve. If this matter can be achieved, our association will be responsible for convening manufacturers to set the rules and regulations. All expenses will be borne by our association and the manufacturers. The percentage of profits to be donated is tentatively set as follows: (1) A certain percentage of the market's business income will be transferred for relief funds. The amount will be decided by the manufacturers' representatives' conference. (2) Market invoices will be distributed by the Jiaxu Association, using a triplicate form. One copy will be given to the customer, one to the Jiaxu Association, and one will be kept by the manufacturer. The amount of relief funds will be calculated based on the invoice, according to the prescribed percentage. A meeting of manufacturers' representatives will be convened to publicly extract the funds. (3) The Jiaxu Association will be responsible for advertising and promotion. This matter can not only raise a large amount of disaster relief funds, but also expand disaster relief and promote domestic goods, achieving two goals with one action. We believe it is a good deed. In addition to sending this letter, we have dispatched Mr. Hu Fengxiang, a member of our association, to meet with Mr. Chu Huiseng, chairman of your association, to discuss the matter. We hope that you will investigate whether this is feasible and provide guidance for implementation. Your public gratitude is deeply appreciated.</p>
<h3>A Public Passenger Nearly Raped by the Ship's Captain</h3>
<p>A Petition to Two Women's Organizations</p>
<p>The Tongmenghui Xie 進會 Convened a Joint Meeting</p>
<p>Four Resolutions Were Made and Submitted to the Ministry for Strict Handling</p>
<p>The New Voice Society reports that the Guoying Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Wuyang ship on the Shanghai-Xiamen-Shantou-Guangdong line is leased from the Yuan'an Shipping Company. The ship's captain, a Norwegian (Captr K. W. Ngquist), complied with local customs. On the 7th of this month, while sailing from Guangzhou to Shanghai, he went to a first-class cabin in Shantou at 1:00 AM at night, intending to rape a female passenger. The passenger, named Li Shuiyan, is a doctor practicing in Shanghai. Because the ship was stuffy, she did not close the cabin door after going to sleep. After the ship's captain entered the room, he groped the woman's head. The passenger immediately woke up and asked why he was there in the middle of the night. The captain then uttered obscene words. Ms. Li immediately slapped him. But the captain still did not leave. He was then tricked out of the room, and the door was locked tightly. The ship's deputy officer, Zhang Huoyan, found out about this. Fearing that she would be unjustly humiliated, he exchanged cabins with the female passenger and came to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, Ms. Li, as a lone female passenger, nearly suffered humiliation. She petitioned the Women's Tongmenghui and the Women's Xie 進會 yesterday, requesting (1) the cancellation of the ship's captain's service in Chinese ships, (2) the cancellation of the ship's captain's seaman's certificate, (3) an order for a public apology in the newspaper. The two women's organizations considered the matter to be of great importance and convened a joint meeting. They resolved (1) to submit the matter to the Ministry of Transportation for strict handling, (2) to request that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company dismiss the person, (3) to request that the Maritime Affairs Bureau revoke his service certificate, (4) to order him to publish an apology in the newspaper.</p>
<h3>Litigation Inevitably Leads to Misfortune</h3>
<p>Dispute Between Zhou Guansan and His Wife</p>
<p>The Judge Firmly Advised Reconciliation</p>
<p>Zhou Guansan, the Chinese general manager of the Far East Aircraft Company from Hangzhou, was sued by his wife, Wang Yuqing, for abuse and neglect of alimony. She requested cohabitation and alimony. The case was again heard on the afternoon of the other day by Judge Zhang Qingkuo of the First Special District Court in the Fourth Civil Court. First, the court ordered Yang Zhongxu, a witness submitted by Zhou Guansan, to appear in court. According to his testimony, he was a colleague of the plaintiff, Wang Yuqing, at Hongdao Girls' High School and is currently a teacher. The court immediately asked if he had seen Wang Yuqing beat Zhou Guansan at Zhou's house in July of last year. He replied that he and the plaintiff went to Guling in July of last year and returned to Shanghai in the late twenties of August. When they arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 AM, they went to Zhou's house to rest. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, they took a car to Hangzhou. Zhou was working at the company at the time and was not at home, so there was no quarrel. Zhou, upon hearing this, immediately claimed that the plaintiff had hit him on the head with a leather shoe and torn his clothes, which the witness had seen. Yang said that he did not see the incident of hitting the head with a leather shoe. As for the tearing of clothes, he said that one day when he went to Zhou's house, Zhou Guansan gave him a piece of clothing to read, which was slightly torn. Zhou said that it was torn by the plaintiff. He then asked the plaintiff why she tore the clothes. She replied that it was because Zhou wanted to go out dancing and she stopped him, which led to the tearing. Yang also said that after the litigation, Zhou Guansan had induced him to go to the lawyer's office and instructed him to testify that the plaintiff had beaten him. Because he had not seen it, he refused. The lawyer then instructed them to mediate. After discussing this with the plaintiff, he proposed three conditions: (1) cohabitation, (2) separation, with appropriate daily expenses, (3) divorce, with appropriate alimony. Unexpectedly, Zhou rejected all of them and criticized him. Therefore, he no longer advised on this matter, and so on. There was also a witness, Lawyer Song Yunhui, who did not appear because he was not in Shanghai. The court, believing that litigation inevitably leads to misfortune, advised reconciliation. However, Zhou did not accept. The court persuaded the plaintiff to proceed, and the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff always advocated a peaceful solution. Therefore, in this environment, she still requested cohabitation. Now that the court has advised reconciliation, the plaintiff's side should accept it. He requested that the hearing be postponed once more to attempt reconciliation. The court approved and ordered the hearing to be postponed for ten days.</p>
<h3>Huang Jinshen, a Lovesick Dancer, Jumps into the River</h3>
<p>No Rescue Possible, Buried in the Clear Stream</p>
<p>Huang Jinshen, a local resident, was only seventeen years old, young and beautiful. He was working as a trainee at a certain bank. He often frequented dance halls, which led to a love affair with a certain dancer. He made a vow of eternal love with the dancer. However, the Huang family had no permanent property and could not afford to marry the dancer. They had to use a hotel as a place for secret meetings. The dancer, burning with passionate love, vowed not to marry anyone but Huang. She had given him a silk scarf, on which she had personally signed her name (in English). On the afternoon of the other day, Huang suddenly went to the Dafang Hotel at No. 310 Zhengjia Bridge in the French Concession, changed his surname to Chen, and closed himself in the room. He wrote three letters, went out to mail them, and then ran to the Bund. He paid two yuan to hire a gasoline boat, rowed to the center of the Huangpu River, took off his long clothes, and jumped into the river to commit suicide. When the gasoline boat crew stopped the boat, no rescue was possible. The police were notified, who then informed the Huangpu River Rescue Bureau to search for the body for investigation.</p>

<h3>The China Economic Credit Cooperative Anniversary Celebration</h3>
<p>Several Hundred Representatives from Various Agencies Attended</p>
<p>Director of Education Pan Gongzhan and Others Gave Successive Speeches</p>
<p>The China Economic Credit Cooperative held its anniversary celebration at 10:00 AM yesterday at its new office at No. 918 Avenue Edward VII. Several hundred co-op members and guests from all walks of life attended, filling the seats. The party and national flags were hung at the entrance of the co-op office, along with the four characters for "Anniversary Celebration". Upon entering, attendees were greeted by co-op staff and received a copy of the co-op's anniversary special issue at the signature desk. On the second floor, the assembly hall was quite spacious. The walls were covered with lists of staff members, membership application forms, various photographs, and various statistical charts. In the center were various silver shields, intended to reward the captains of the teams that had achieved excellent results in expanding membership this year. The chairman was Zhang Shouyong, the chairman of the co-op's board of directors.</p>
<p>The Chairman Delivers the Opening Remarks</p>
<p>First, the chairman reported, stating that Chinese people lack organizational skills and that promoting cooperation is even more necessary. However, it cannot be rushed. Now, the co-op is like a one-year-old infant, and the responsibility for its protection lies with all sectors of society, especially the co-op members. All undertakings cannot rely solely on one or two responsible persons, but must rely on the collective wisdom and efforts of everyone. We not only hope that the co-op members will work together, but also hope that all sectors of society will rise up and promote it. As for the co-op's affairs, please listen to the report from General Manager Qiu Hanping. Qiu Hanping then reported on past work, future plans, and the current situation of cooperation in various countries in detail. The speech was lengthy and is omitted. Part of it is the same as the co-op's anniversary special issue in yesterday's major newspapers. Next, Director of Education Pan Gongzhan gave a speech.</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan's Speech</p>
<p>The asset-owning class does not need cooperatives. Those who need cooperation are the middle and lower classes. In the past, our country had a mutual assistance method. If a person needed one hundred yuan, they could borrow ten yuan each from ten relatives and friends, and then repay them in installments. This is the old method. Now, this economic credit cooperative is a new method, which is much better than the old method. It takes the savings of the co-op members and invests them, lending them to the co-op members. It can be said that everyone is helping others, and everyone is getting help from others. The promotion of cooperation in our country dates back to about fifteen years ago, but the results have not been good. Now, this economic cooperative is promising and will definitely be able to develop. In Shanghai, except for a small number of capitalists, there are at least 360,000 people who need to join cooperatives. Even if we cut that in half, there are still 180,000 people. Even if we cut that in half again, there are still 90,000 people. Now the number of people is only a little over a thousand. This is because everyone does not understand the benefits. Once everyone understands, they will naturally come to participate. May I ask, joining a co-op not only has the dual benefits of saving and insurance, but also has various loans, various consultants, and low consumption. Which bank saver or insurance company policyholder has such great benefits? Now let's take the International Savings Society as an example. It takes the money of the majority of members to provide prizes for a very small number of people, and the society profits from it. Does it have the benefit of various loans? No. Does it have the benefit of various consultants? No. Is its money used to invest in businesses that benefit society and benefit members? No. It is used to buy foreign public debt tickets and benefit foreigners. Isn't this very different compared to the economic cooperative? The benefits of joining the International Savings Society are far less than those of the economic cooperative. And now the number of members of the International Savings Society is at least over 100,000. So the future of the economic cooperative will definitely be able to develop. When the International Savings Society was first established, the number of members was only about 2,000, which is about the same as the current number of people in the economic cooperative. We don't need to be disappointed because of the small number of people now. We must know that "the beginning is simple, but the end will be great." As long as each co-op member can introduce ten people to join each year, there will be more than 10,000 co-op members by the second anniversary next year.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou's Speech</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou, chairman of the co-op's fund management committee, said that without economics, there is no credit, and without credit, there can be no cooperation. We speak of economics, credit, and cooperation. Not only the responsible staff of the co-op, but also the individual co-op members should do so. I am responsible for the custody of the fund, which is strictly and seriously guarded. I have never been lazy or sloppy. We are all trustworthy and will never be perfunctory. I hope that co-op members and guests will spread the word to ten people, and ten people to a hundred, so that the general public will know our credibility and come to join the cooperation.</p>
<p>He Dekui's Speech</p>
<p>He Dekui, a member of the Public Works Bureau, said that there are three conditions for the development of cooperatives: first, there must be credit; second, there must be members with similar lives and the same needs; and third, there must be a fixed address. The development of cooperatives in the United States is not as good as in Germany and England because they lack the second and third points. Now, the responsible persons of this co-op are Zhang Shouyong, Lin Kanghou, and Qiu Hanping, all of whom are highly reputable in society. The first condition is not a problem. The second condition, according to the discount just given by Director Pan, at least tens of thousands of people in Shanghai have similar lives and the same needs, which is also not a problem. The third condition, although some people living in Shanghai are mobile, most are still fixed. So all three conditions are met, and the co-op's future will definitely develop. Cooperatives originally have economic significance, but they also have indirect political influence. The result of economic cooperation is that the general public can also unite politically, so that they will not become a scattered sand. Shanghai needs cooperatives, and the interior needs cooperatives even more. Shanghai is leading the interior. If the co-op does well, the interior will follow suit and promote it, which will definitely be a great success.</p>
<p>Awards for Expanding Membership</p>
<p>After the speeches, it was already late, so the award ceremony for expanding membership this year was held. The chairman presented various silver shields and flags of the "Cooperation Pioneer". The groups with the most members recruited were Liu Daofang, Qiu Hanping, and Xia Suqi. The individuals with the most members recruited were Xie Xiaochu, Luo Youxiang, and Jiang Zhensan. The individuals with the most recruits were Xie Xiaochu, Yu Tingyu, and Xi Chengyuan. Although the crowd was extremely crowded, the order of the venue was very good. Zhang, Qiu, Pan, Lin, He, and others received great applause from the audience during their speeches. After the awards, refreshments and photos were taken.</p>
<p>A Variety Show in the Afternoon</p>
<p>After the meeting, the crowd flocked to the Golden Grand Theatre in the Eight Immortals Bridge area. An endless stream of co-op members and guests entered, with the number of participants increasing several times to about 2,000 people. The upstairs and downstairs were full. The Silver Moon Dance Troupe, consisting of more than thirty young women, all talented in both art and beauty, and led by Ms. Zhang Chane, performed from 12:20 to 2:00 PM. All of the scheduled programs were performed except for the grass skirt dance, which was changed to "Little Butterfly". The performances of "Red Face Army", "Seeking Love", "Lilac Mountain", and "Little Butterfly" were especially well received by the audience, with thunderous applause. It is said that the troupe is led by Li Jinhui and is well-trained. Since performing at the Wood Market, the audience has been no less than hundreds of thousands of people. This performance was purely voluntary.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-based Lake Gentlemen Chen Qicai and Others Plead for the Disaster Victims of Wuxing and Other Counties</h3>
<p>The Disaster Situation in Wuxing, Deqing, and Xiaofeng is Very Serious</p>
<p>Please Send Personnel to Re-Survey and Release Emergency Relief Funds</p>
<p>Shanghai-based Lake gentlemen Chen Aishi, Wang Yiting, Qian Xinzhi, and others are concerned about the serious disaster situation in Wuxing, Deqing, and Xiaofeng counties, but the Zhejiang Provincial Relief Committee has not released relief funds. They have specially described the disaster situation and jointly sent a letter to the Zhejiang Civil and Financial Provincial Directors, pleading on behalf of the disaster victims. Please send personnel to re-survey and quickly release relief funds to rescue the stranded fish and eliminate hidden dangers. The original letter is recorded as follows: Directors Qu Sheng, Xicun, and Renxiong, I am writing to you. Since the great flood in Lake six counties in the Xiwai year, they have not yet recovered. This year, they have suffered another drought, which is in an unmanageable state, causing the remaining disaster victims to exhaust all their possessions and reach a state of desperation. In this period of drowning without help, starving people are everywhere, with pale faces and emaciated bodies. They sell their daughters and sons in the market to exchange for a few pints of rice. They eat weeds, die of poisoning, and even commit suicide as a family because they cannot continue to feed themselves. They have no way to borrow and beg in the streets. All of these tragic scenes have factual evidence and are not deliberately depicted. Therefore, the severity of this year's disaster is greater than in the past. Emergency relief is needed to alleviate the suffering. We have previously detailed the disaster situation and sent a letter to the Zhejiang Relief Committee to quickly release emergency relief funds. Now we hear that the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association representatives who went to Hangzhou to attend the relief meeting reported back to Shanghai, learning that Wuxing, Deqing, and Xiaofeng counties of Lake Province are not included in the list of group relief funds. We are deeply disturbed. It is also said that the division of group relief funds is based on the surveys of the Civil and Financial Provincial Directors. There are still seven county surveys that have not been reported to the province. Whether Wuxing and other three counties are among these seven counties that have not been completed is unknown. I think that the disaster situation in these three counties is no different from that of the neighboring counties. I would like to explain the situation to you in detail. According to the three counties, the farmland that is usually planted with early rice is all from the guest people of Wenzhou and Taizhou Lakes, who lack knowledge of sericulture. Their planting is usually in July, and after inspecting the situation, there is still a small harvest. Therefore, the three county magistrates and the provincial committee reported to the provincial government before the end of July, without knowing that the local villagers, when the guest people were planting, were in the midst of raising silkworms. After the silkworm business was completed, planting and cultivating the fields was a different kind of late rice. They encountered a long drought and no rain, and the ponds were dry, making it impossible to rescue them. Some were unable to plant, and others planted but still withered. Even buckwheat and soybeans could not be planted. Encountering this strange disaster, they have no harvest at all. Moreover, the silk industry has declined, and there is no food from the previous night, so how can they survive? This is the actual situation of the disaster after the end of July, which the three county magistrates and the provincial committee did not report a second time. As a result, the disaster victims have gathered in the thousands, rushing to the county seat, crying and appealing, and抢米夺食. The district of Lake Province is adjacent to Su and Wan, the source of bandits. The highway reaches the capital. Although there is no risk of agitation, if they are taken advantage of by bandits, it will not only disrupt Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but also shake the capital. In terms of emotion and judgment, it is more than that of Haining and others. In this autumn of commercial recession, even if we try our best to solicit donations, the amount obtained will be small, and a cup of water cannot extinguish a cart of burning wood. Therefore, I have written this letter to appeal to you, begging you to send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and re-survey, and to list Wuxing, Deqing, and Xiaofeng counties separately, releasing emergency relief funds as soon as possible to rescue the stranded fish and eliminate hidden dangers. I cannot bear to look forward to your prayers. I am writing to you sincerely, wishing you good health. Brothers Chen Qicai, Wang Zhen, Qian Yongming, Shen Yong, Shen Zechun, Yuan Zhongxiu, Yu Fengshao, and Yu Shuxun.</p>
<h3>Dai Jilu's Appeal to the Supreme Court Rejected Again</h3>
<p>Still Sentenced to Four Months Imprisonment and a Fine of Six Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Dai Jilu, also known as Dai Liu, a native of Suzhou, nicknamed "Little Liu, the swindler," was a disciple of Cao Awu, the fugitive gambling king. In the early summer of last year, due to a dispute with his concubine, Jia Meili, Meili, holding their son, went to her parents' home. Dai immediately reported to the French Concession police, accusing Meili of absconding with property and requesting an investigation. At the same time, he gathered people and rushed to Meili's parents' house, attempting to seize the child. Meili reported to the French Concession police, accusing Dai of intimidation and requesting protection. While both parties were pressing charges against each other, the detective chief of the gambling squad of the French Concession police discovered that Dai had served as a "major director of internal relief" when Lu Laoqi operated a gambling den for "tong zi," and he was wanted for this offense. Therefore, he sent detectives to arrest Dai, collect evidence, and transfer him to the Second Special District Local Court. The lawyer representing the police department filed a public prosecution according to the law. Judge Wang Gangxu repeatedly held hearings and interrogated gambling offenders from the Second Special District Prison to finalize the case. Dai was sentenced to four months imprisonment and a fine of six hundred yuan. During the appeal period, he was allowed to be released on bail with a lien guarantee from Yang Lianhuan Shop while awaiting instructions. Subsequently, Dai, dissatisfied with the verdict, presented reasons and a statement to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, filing an appeal. The result of the trial was that the appeal was deemed to have no substantial counter-evidence presented, and was purely empty argument. There was no basis for the appeal, so the appeal was rejected. Dai, still unwilling to accept this, appealed to the Supreme Court for a third trial, hoping to be declared innocent. Ultimately, the ironclad case was insurmountable and impossible to overturn. The Supreme Court had reviewed the entire case file and concluded that the appeal was still without merit. A judgment was announced the other day rejecting Dai Jilu's appeal. As soon as the judgment is delivered to the Third Branch of the High Court, it will summon the appellant to court and send him to prison to serve his sentence.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern: We have recently received a statement from our clients, Mr. Gu Shaoqing, Mr. Tang Jingseng, and Mr. Xu Taiyu, of the Yuxing Steamship Company, stating that on the 6th of this month, the Shanghai Daily News published a news item in the local news column about the tragic case of the Xin Renhe Steamship, which stated that the Xin Renhe Steamship of the Yuxing Company in Nanshi was involved in a drug trafficking incident, and that as a result of secret discussions between the manager, Gu Shaoqing, and the assistant manager, Tang Jingseng, etc., Ma Koubao and four others were sunk into the sea. It also stated that Ting Taiyu, the former accomplice in the murder, secretly invited the relatives of the deceased to the company to intimidate and entice them, opened room number 435 in the Central Hotel, and forced them to sign documents, etc. The case of Sun Xingsheng and others being suspected of murdering Ma Koubao and four others has been investigated and judged by the Shanghai Local Court, and is now under the third trial. According to the indictment of prosecutor Zhang Zi and the contents of the judgments of each trial, not only Shaoqing, Jingseng, Taiyu, and others have absolutely no suspicion of conspiracy or being accomplices, but also the Xin Renhe Steamship has not been involved in any drug trafficking. As for the so-called secret invitation of the relatives of the deceased to the company to intimidate and entice them, and the forcing of them to sign documents in room number 435 of the Central Hotel, it is even more unfounded. However, the newspaper has a clear and untrue record of this matter. It is undoubtedly the use of the newspaper's words by unscrupulous people to deliberately slander Shaoqing, Jingseng, Taiyu, and others. We have specially entrusted your lawyer to send a letter to the newspaper, requesting that the letter be published immediately to correct the record. Accordingly, our lawyer has reviewed the matter and found no difference. We hereby request your newspaper to check and make a correction. This is addressed to the Shanghai Daily News Local News Editorial Department, Lawyer Guo Yihui, November 10.</p>
<p>Editor Sir: Yesterday, I read a news item in your newspaper entitled "Wang Yigong, Accused by Luo Yulan, Suddenly Received Three Threatening Letters in a Row." The content of the news item does not correspond to the facts, and I am deeply afraid that it will confuse the public. Therefore, I will detail the past course of my lawyer's handling of the case below, and I hope that you will publish it in the letter column to correct the public's perception. On October 13 of this year, Mr. Zhou Wenhua, a fellow villager from Changzhou, and Ms. Luo Yulan, together came to my office. According to their statement, Yulan was originally the wife of Sang Zhenbang of Changshu. Since she brought her private savings to Shanghai this summer and met with Wang Yigong, she divorced her husband and lived with Wang. They first lived in Zhabei, and then moved to the French Concession. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 12th of this month, Wang Yigong not only tricked Yulan into going to a hostel and kept her there under false pretenses, but also moved all the valuables from the residence. In addition to reporting the fact that Yigong had moved the property to the police station and requesting assistance, he also asked your lawyer to draft a complaint according to the law to prosecute Wang Yigong's acts of undermining public morals and malicious abandonment, etc. (The details of the original complaint, etc., have been disclosed by various newspapers in Yulan's statement,) and Zhou filled out the facts and signed the commission contract, and then the complaint was drafted and submitted to the court. On the 23rd of the same month, Yulan and Zhou Wenhua came to my office again, saying that they had received a notice from the police station that the case of Wang Yigong moving the property would be sent to the court for trial on October 30. As for the attached private prosecution part of the case concerning the hidden property, he also asked to appear in court as an agent. Since the matter was normal, I agreed to his request and then received the court's notification of the court date for Luo Yulan's lawsuit against Wang Yigong for undermining public morals, etc., which stated that the hearing would be held on the afternoon of October 30. On the 24th of October, Zhou Wenhua delivered a copy of Wang Yigong's lawsuit against Luo Yulan and Zhong Dexin for breach of trust, and a subpoena. After reading the subpoena, I learned that the date of the hearing was also October 30. Therefore, I went to the court on time that morning, and after checking, I found that there was no Luo Yulan case among the cases delivered to the court by the police station that day. I immediately went to the police station to inquire about the matter. The police station replied that the case still needed to be investigated further and that the delivery had been temporarily postponed. That afternoon, I went to the First Special District Court and the Second Special District Court one after the other to appear in court, and the courts changed the dates separately. (The First Special District changed the date to the 8th of this month, and the Second Special District changed the date to the 3rd of this month.) On the 3rd, when I appeared in court on time, Wang Yigong argued that Luo Yulan was a prostitute and gathered maids, etc. The court changed the date to the 7th of this month to summon her. On the afternoon of the 4th, Luo Yulan and Zhou Wenhua came to my office again and said that they had been falsely accused yesterday, and they were deeply afraid that it would be difficult to prove the facts. In addition to planning to invite Sang Zhenbang's relatives and friends to prove that Yulan was indeed a good woman, they also planned to return to Changshu and beg Shao Fen, the original matchmaker, and Sang's relatives and friends to persuade her ex-husband Zhenbang to come to the case and prove the facts in order to clear their grievances. However, considering that the feelings between her and Zhenbang had been severed, it may be difficult to invite him to the case, and the wind and rain were heavy, and although the date had been set, they were deeply afraid that they would miss the court date on the 7th of this month. They asked me to detail the whole story and continue to submit a statement to the court to allow the date to be extended. On the 7th of this month, Luo Yulan did not arrive in Shanghai. I submitted the above-mentioned statement to the court on the 8th, and in the afternoon of the same day, I went to the First Special District Local Court to appear in court again, stating the reason why Luo Yulan could not arrive. The court ruled that Wang Yigong's lawsuit against Luo Yulan was under the wrong jurisdiction, and the case was dismissed after the hearing. When I returned to the office after the court was adjourned, Lu Shaofen was already waiting in the office with Sang Zhenbang. They said that since the matter had reached this point, Yulan was indeed pitiful, and they could only come to court to testify truthfully, etc., and then left. After a moment, Luo Yulan also came to the office and said that she had returned to Shanghai yesterday and had gone to the court. She should have reported at any time, but she was sick in bed all day long because of the cold on the way, which caused the delay. Sang Zhenbang had been persuaded by a friend and had hired a motorboat to come to Shanghai with Lu Shaofen, and they were now staying at the Oriental Hotel. He asked whether they had been to the office. I told them that Lu and Sang had both been there. This is the past course of my lawyer's handling of the case. I hope that you will publish it as it is to correct the record. With best regards, Lawyer Gao Danhua, November 10, 23rd year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>錢塘江橋籌備報告（續）</h3>
<p>(D) Design Research</p>
<p>All engineering designs should prioritize solidity, applicability, economy, and aesthetics. While materials and styles may vary, bridge theory has largely converged in the engineering world. Given the same conditions and market prices, regardless of construction method, a rational design should not result in vastly different costs. The design criteria for this bridge have been detailed previously. Initially, the Zhejiang Construction Department requested design proposals from American bridge expert Dr. Waddell. After the establishment of the Bridge Construction Committee, extensive research was conducted to formulate the following design principles: (1) The Qiantang River is shallow, and its sandbanks are prone to unpredictable shifts. To accommodate navigation, equal bridge pier spacing is preferable. (2) This bridge is a combined railway and highway bridge, and the needs of various transportation modes should be considered. Given the bridge's length of one kilometer, efficient transportation is essential to save time. (3) This bridge is strategically important for national defense, and military considerations should be taken into account. (4) Hangzhou is a scenic city, and the bridge's design should consider the views from both banks. The six proposed designs are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Twenty-nine spans of 120-foot upper-supported girders, totaling 3,480 feet in length, with a girder height of 14 feet. Its advantage lies in its economical layout, with the railway above, a pedestrian walkway below, and highways on the side arms. All girder gaps are fully utilized, and pier dimensions are greatly reduced. This type of combined railway-highway bridge design is innovative in bridge history and can be considered novel. However, the span is smaller than required, and the highway lacks overtaking space, which may impede traffic flow given the bridge's length.</p>
<p>(2) Twenty-three spans of 153-foot lower-supported girders, totaling 3,519 feet in length. The bridge structure is a double-layered construction, with a girder height of 25 feet. The railway is below, and the highway and pedestrian walkway are above. This style is most convenient for railway and highway traffic.</p>
<p>(3) Twenty-one spans of 164-foot lower-supported girders, totaling 3,444 feet in length, with a girder height of 27 feet. The railway is in the middle, with highways and pedestrian walkways alongside, supported by side-arm girders on the same level as the railway.</p>
<p>(4) Nineteen spans of 184-foot lower-supported girders, totaling 3,496 feet in length, with a girder height of 28 feet. Its layout is the same as the second type.</p>
<p>(5) Sixteen spans of 220-foot lower-supported girders, totaling 3,520 feet in length, with a girder height of 35 feet. Its layout is the same as the second type.</p>
<p>(6) Eleven spans of 310-foot lower-supported girders, totaling 3,410 feet in length. Because the span is very long, the distance between the two girders is wider, so a single-layer flat arrangement of railway and highway is adopted. The girder structure is also changed to a curved string to reduce weight.</p>
<p>The above, together with Dr. Waddell's design, makes a total of seven options for choice and rejection, which took considerable research. Each has its own merits, but none can satisfy all aspects perfectly. Only the most economically viable option can be adopted. After careful consideration by the committee, the 220-foot design was deemed the most appropriate and it was decided to use it for bidding. Detailed drawings of each part were prepared for valuation purposes. The outline of this plan is as follows:</p>
<p>A double-layer steel beam bridge with sixteen spans, each 220 feet long, totaling 3,520 feet, will be built within one kilometer of the Qiantang River control line. The upper layer is for highways with pedestrian walkways on both sides, and the lower layer is for a single-track railway. The bridge is 35 feet high, with the girders spaced 20 feet apart. A Warren-style structure is used, and all joint connections are riveted. The upper highway bridge deck is constructed of reinforced concrete, 7 inches thick, supported by longitudinal and transverse steel beams, connected to the upper chord of the lattice girder. The lower railway bridge deck consists of steel rails, wooden sleepers, and longitudinal and transverse beams, connected to the vertical rods of the lattice girder. Both the upper and lower chords have wind-resistant frames, using riveted connections. All internal designs are calculated according to specifications. All fifteen bridge piers are constructed of reinforced concrete, with hollows inside to reduce weight. Where the piers support the bridge seat, the pier cap is 33.5 feet long and 10 feet wide, with rounded ends. The pier seat extends 70 feet below the high water level. The nine piers near the south bank are supported by 160 wooden piles each, each bearing 35 tons and approximately 100 feet long. The six piers on the north bank, due to the shallower stone layer, use the caisson pneumatic method to sink the pier seat to bedrock without using wooden piles. At the end of the main bridge, there is an approach bridge and an abutment. The south bank uses the wooden pile method, and the north bank uses the caisson method. Arch bridges and concrete pile beams are used outside the piers as highway approach bridges. The lower-level railway will be built on embankment from the bridge abutment and connected to the railway on both banks.</p>
<p>(E) Bidding Situation</p>
<p>Once the design was finalized, bidding began. In addition to preparing drawings, Chinese and English engineering specifications and tender forms were drafted as guidelines. The content of the specifications followed the regulations issued by the Ministry of Railways, while the tender forms considered the situation of domestic construction companies. The entire bridge project was divided into nine sections to facilitate selection. On April 15th of this year, a public notice was placed in the newspaper inviting contractors to bid. A total of 32 companies successively obtained the tender documents and drawings, including 17 domestic companies and 15 foreign companies (5 German, 4 British, 2 Czech, and 1 each from France, Japan, Netherlands, and Denmark). The original bid opening date was June 18th, but the bidders repeatedly requested postponement until August 22nd. At that time, the Ministry of Railways sent Pu Dengqing, Deputy Director of the Engineering Department of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government sent Zhang Jianxuan, Secretary of the Construction Department, and Tang Shijian, Section Chief of the Finance Department, to supervise the bid opening. A total of 17 bids were received, including 9 from domestic companies and 8 from foreign companies. The supervising committee unsealed and read each bid one by one and published a list of the total prices for each section. That night, the staff of the Engineering Department worked overnight to check each bid price and prepared fifteen comparison tables of the nine bid prices, materials, and unit prices for the next day's bid review.</p>
<p>(F) Bid Review and Award</p>
<p>The bridge project is grand, and the content of the bids is complex. To be cautious, the Zhejiang Province organized a Bid Review Committee, and the Ministry of Railways organized a Design Review Committee, to recruit domestic engineering experts for careful study. The Bid Review Committee included Chairman Chen Ticheng, and members Hua Nan Gui, Jun Hongxun, Zheng Hua, Desford, Pu Dengqing, Zhou Xiangxian, Ye Jiajun, Zhu Yaoting, Zhang Zili, Hou Jiayuan, Mao Yisheng, and Luo Ying. The Design Review Committee included Chairman Sun Mou, and members Yan Defei, Chen Yaozu, Zheng Hua, Desford, White House, Pu Dengqing, Jun Hongxun, Luo Lu, Yuan Menghong, Wang Guixun, Zhao Zheng, Mao Yisheng, and Luo Ying. In addition to holding separate meetings, the two committees also held joint meetings to approve the design of the Engineering Department (except for minor revisions) and resolved to contract out the bridge project in three parts: (1) Main Bridge Steel Beams, (2) Main Bridge Piers, and (3) Approach Bridges at Both Ends. The order of bid selection is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Main Bridge Steel Beams - (1) Daomenlang Company, (2) Siemens Foreign Firm.</p>
<p>(2) Main Bridge Piers - (1) Yiyi Foreign Firm, (2) Xinheng Construction Company, (3) Baoli Company.</p>
<p>(3) Approach Bridges at Both Ends - (1) Dongya Construction Company, (2) Xinheng Construction Company. The Engineering Department then contacted them in sequence. (1) The experience, capabilities, equipment, and reputation of each company are very important and must be investigated separately to clarify the truth. (2) Bids with ambiguous meanings must be clarified separately. (3) If the construction methods of each company are different and require modification to be applicable, the price increase or decrease should be clarified. (4) If the completion period reported by each company is too long, the cost of shortening it should be clarified. (5) For those who submitted bids with their own designs, the content must be reviewed and the pros and cons discussed. After multiple explorations, the department compared the situation of each company in a list and submitted it to the Ministry and Province for approval, and separately discussed the contract and signed the construction contract.</p>
<p>(G) Work Fund Calculation</p>
<p>When the bridge was first proposed, many were concerned that the project was difficult and the cost was too high to be realized. When Dr. Waddell's design arrived, it was estimated that a total of 7.58 million yuan would be needed, which provided a scope to follow. However, such a large amount was difficult to obtain. Subsequently, the Bridge Construction Committee investigated the domestic market situation and slightly modified the design content and re-estimated that more than 5.1 million yuan was still needed (including approach bridge connection). According to the market price at that time, it could hardly be reduced. Therefore, based on this number, the Zhejiang Construction Department consulted with the Huai River Guidance Committee and obtained the consent of the Sino-British Gengkuan Board of Trustees to borrow 160,000 pounds for materials. It also requested the National Economic Council to allocate a loan of 1 million yuan in national currency. At the same time, the Zhejiang Finance Department borrowed 2 million yuan from Zhejiang Xingye, China, Transportation, Siming, and Zhejiang Industrial five banks, all of which were successful. A total of 5.5 million yuan was obtained, which was sufficient for the entire project. Later, the Ministry of Railways, with the success of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway loan, could bear the cost of the bridge. Therefore, it negotiated with Zhejiang and each recognized half of the bridge's cost. The method of raising funds was re-allocated. Zhejiang Province still used bank loans as capital, and the Ministry of Railways used Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway bonds issued by the Sino-British Bank and Construction Bank as capital, each recognizing 2 million yuan, and the remainder would be raised when needed. According to the results of this bidding, the main bridge steel beams cost more than 1.3 million yuan (according to the latest exchange rate), the main bridge piers cost more than 1.5 million yuan, the approach bridges on both sides cost more than 400,000 yuan, and the highway and railway pavement cost more than 200,000 yuan, totaling about 3.6 million yuan (excluding tariffs), plus connection and administrative expenses, etc., 4 million yuan may be sufficient. Therefore, the raising of work funds is no longer a major problem.</p>
<p>(H) Work Procedure</p>
<p>The bridge project was originally scheduled to be completed in two years. Later, due to the rapid progress of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the urgent need to complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, it was agreed with the bidders to shorten the working time and appropriately increase the labor cost. It was proposed that the entire project be completed within one and a half years from the date of commencement. If it can be done, not only the bridge revenue will be advanced by half a year and the loan can be cleared early, but also the administrative expenses of bridge construction will be reduced accordingly, which is the most economical method. However, the bridge is of great importance, and time should never be emphasized at the expense of quality. Therefore, the contracting factories must prepare more tools and start construction on all parts at the same time, and the Engineering Department must also assign more supervisors to work day and night without懈怠, so that we can achieve success through joint efforts. What is especially important is that the work procedure must be properly formulated according to the situation of the Qiantang River and the tools and equipment, so that there will be no differences and the entire project can be carried out smoothly. This degree has been studied in detail by the Engineering Department and the contractors, and will be implemented step by step from the date of commencement. By June next year, all bridge piers can be started.</p>

<p>Chapter 4: A Cup of Water Reveals Hardship, a Poor Laborer Protects the Elderly; A Thousand Gold Can Be Discussed, a Cunning Official Forms a Gang</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller said: Half the road is done, you have to add money. Li Shilian said: I don't want to add money. Saying that, he flicked his sleeves and left. Two hours later, Li Shilian was covered in sweat. His shoes were all covered in dust. He went back to Xiaoxitian. When he returned to his room, he saw his fellow villager Guo Dunpin talking to the tea room attendant in the courtyard. The tea room attendant said: He's here, he's here. He turned his head, saw Li Shilian, raised his hand high, and repeatedly bowed: I expected you to come long ago, why did you only arrive today? I just went to the Finance Department and saw the department director. Did it work? Li Shilian saw that there were many people in the courtyard, snorted in his nose, and casually agreed. Guo Dunpin stepped forward and held one of his hands: I'm here, and I'm suffering from not having any friends to associate with. Now that you've come, that's great. The tea room attendant opened the door. Li Shilian led him in. Before he sat down, he laughed: I came today, although I was anxious to see you, but also anxious to say hello to you. You don't have to campaign for anything. Just think of a way to handle the aftermath. Li Shilian was stunned when he heard this. Why, after so long since we last met, does his first sentence of advice tell me to handle the aftermath? Do we all have the death penalty when we come to Xi'an to seek jobs? He took off his hat, wanting to hang it on the coat hook, but he couldn't hang it high enough, and couldn't retract it, so he made a posture and stood under the wainscoting. Guo Dunpin suddenly realized that he had a misunderstanding of being out of touch with current affairs. So he laughed: Brother, you want to come to Shaanxi to handle tax revenue, don't you even inquire about some tax revenue names? There is a type of funds here, called the "Aftermath Donation," which is a special tax outside Tongguan. What a special tax is, you should understand, there's no need for me to say it. Only then did Li Shilian hang up his hat, turned around and smiled at him: You suddenly told me to handle the aftermath, how would I know these twists and turns? But I don't know the detailed situation. Please sit, please sit, I'm just about to ask for your guidance on everything. (61)</p>
<h3>大學生宿舍</h3>
<p>— By Sun Yucai</p>
<p>Recently, I have visited several friends who are college students, and have patronized the student dormitories of several universities. I feel that the arrangements in the college student dormitories have a similar trend.</p>
<p>On the pink and white walls, we see a ten-inch or twelve-inch large art or colored half-length photo, a crisp suit, and a tie that hangs three-dimensionally on the chest. This is the portrait of the owner of this dormitory. Around this photo, there are many photos of women, mostly beautiful young girls, some half-length, some full-length, some sitting, some standing, and the clothing is also of various styles, but it is always the so-called most fashionable, 1934, 35, 36 style, and they all share a charming smile, and those autumn waves seem to be looking at me.</p>
<p>I am an amateur when it comes to movies. Except for the queen of the silver screen, Hu Die, I can barely recognize the movie actresses in the photos. As for the rest, such as Ruan Lingyu and Yuan Meiyun, I can't recognize them. When I first saw so many fashionable ladies' portraits on the pink and white walls, I thought that these were the girlfriends or female classmates that this friend had made after becoming a college student. So I happily said: "Old K! It's over, how are you going to deal with so many girlfriends?" This sentence made my friend laugh, and he said: "You've been in Shanghai for so many years, and you've watched a lot of movies, but you can't even recognize the photos of several famous female stars. Remember this time, and don't make a fool of yourself again."</p>
<p>I was very curious, where did so many photos come from? He said: This can be bought from photo studios in the Ningbo Road area: and many cinemas are holding big giveaways of star photos there.</p>
<p>Later, in several other college student dormitories, I saw the same situation.</p>
<p>Is this probably a symbol of the development of college students' aesthetic concepts? Because stars are all beautiful, of course, this has two different flavors compared to the maps and landscape photos of the three northeastern provinces hanging in Japanese student dormitories!</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— (Qifeng Louzhu)</p>
<p>All things originate from drops and specks. Someone has already said it. I will now talk about the most glorious "speck" and the most solemn "drop":</p>
<p>In the past, during the imperial examinations, when you got to the palace examination, the emperor would add a scarlet dot on your exam paper with his own brush, and you would be the number one scholar. I think this "speck" is the most glorious, right?</p>
<p>Father and son or mother and daughter are unfortunately separated from childhood. Even if they meet later, it is difficult to identify them. Only the blood-dropping method can be used to solve this. This "drop" of blood is of course the most solemn.</p>
<h3>人海</h3>
<p>— By Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>I now live in a metropolis that is a sea of people, so I often walk in a sea of people at times.</p>
<p>The scene of the sea of people is lively! These countless people of all shapes and sizes: there are young students wearing beautiful suits, there are shop clerks wearing badges, there are foreign sailors wearing small caps crookedly, there are Western gentlemen with their chests puffed out, there are couples holding arms, there are fashionable young ladies with rouge and powder, there are tattered beggars with pigeon-shaped faces and swan-shaped faces... These people show all kinds of different postures, and they rush past the iron front busily; I walk in such a complex and vast sea of people, and I myself seem insignificant.</p>
<p>Am I really as insignificant as a drop of water in the sea? (I ask myself.) Formally, perhaps I can admit it; if I had no soul, no reason, spiritual numbness, and emotional disappearance, then I would be even less than a drop of water in the sea: but I am not like that. I have passion, I know how to work hard, and I want to stride across the course of human development. I want to be loyal and courageous and start a superhuman career. I cannot be relegated to being a mere puppet in the sea of people!</p>
<p>That is to say: if I am a drop of water in the sea, I should also be a drop of water in the storm.</p>
<h3>老調又來了</h3>
<p>— By Tongfu</p>
<h3>縫窮婦</h3>
<p>— By Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>The climate is gradually transitioning from warm air to cold lines, autumn is deep—the cotton clothes that people need are also being made, sorted, and prepared at this time. The rich make heavy fur coats and silk cotton clothes. What about the poor? They can only sort out old clothes, patchwork gowns, and sparrow garments, which are their only means of preventing the cold.</p>
<p>In a deep autumn season, it is the busiest season for self-reliant poor seamstresses. They carry needle and thread bags, or baskets, running from east street to west street, mending clothes and sorting out old clothes for people. They are used to transactions of three copper coins and five cents, and don't mind the meager business.</p>
<p>The customers of poor seamstresses are coolies and rickshaw pullers. These days, because people need to wear cotton clothes, the work of poor seamstresses is very busy. In the slums, next to grass houses, they are snatched from house to house, doing odd jobs and full-time jobs. They are really too busy to handle it all. In fact, it takes four or five hours to sort out a torn garment for ten copper coins, including needle and thread, which is not as cost-effective and labor-saving as a patch for two cents.</p>
<p>The more difficult the social economy, the more starving old women are in general poverty and loneliness. Their only way out is to be poor seamstresses to solve their current livelihood problems. The production of poor seamstresses, whether in large cities or small villages, has been increasing in recent years. However, they don't have time to mend their own torn and broken clothes. They specialize in mending for others, running around and working for wages, but their stomachs are still not full. The suffering of poor seamstresses has recently been felt to be a difficulty in grabbing food bowls and making famines. Apart from doing this kind of thing, they can't find another way out.</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I see that these long-idle palaces are almost all cleaned up very neatly, and all the decorations and displays are also arranged very appropriately. The Empress Dowager will undoubtedly be satisfied when she sees them. These achievements are created by the group of eunuchs who were sent here in advance; their number is not large, and the time is very limited, but they can have such outstanding achievements, which I admire very much.</p>
<p>After the Empress Dowager watched it in the palace for a while, her first request was to take a nap; a nap was a task that the Empress Dowager could not do without every day. Today, when we got off the train, it was about twelve o'clock. By the time we solemnly performed this reception ceremony, it was almost three o'clock. Her usual nap time had already arrived; even if she didn't express it herself, we would have automatically prepared it for her.</p>
<p>Since the palaces in Shengjing have been cleaned up and arranged in this way, of course there is also a very suitable bedroom for the Empress Dowager to rest in; therefore, she expressed her desire to quickly go to the new bedroom to solve her first nap after arriving in Fengtian. After she expressed this, all of us had to immediately change our set of actions. The colors that were originally huddled together in piles have gradually dispersed: those eunuchs who accounted for the largest number, returned to their original positions, buried their heads, and went to work separately; the Guangxu Emperor, a political prisoner, did not need to serve the Empress Dowager, and in fact he was unwilling to serve the Empress Dowager, and the Empress Dowager did not want him to serve her, so after the Empress Dowager had an expression of wanting to take a nap, he also took a few eunuchs and went to his own bedroom. His bedroom was next to the Empress Dowager's bedroom, very close, and further on, was the bedroom of his wife, Empress Longyu, and Consort Jin. (171)</p>

<h3>A Lonely Goose in the Vast Sky</h3>
<p>— Xia Qian of Xiamen</p>
<p>My fellow townsman, Mr. Huang Xiaqian of Xiamen, has been teaching at Tsinghua University in Peiping for five years. This year, he was granted a year's sabbatical and provided with funds by the university to study aerometeorology in the United States. I met him in Shanghai when he was departing and asked him to write to me about his journey. I recently received a letter from him describing the situation of the overseas Chinese in great detail. I am selecting the main points and publishing them here, perhaps for the reference of those going to the United States. (Note by Ji Ping)</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese in San Francisco are the most numerous in the United States and have the longest history. This time, seeing a large number of young people from the motherland coming to study, they held a warm welcome reception, treating them to Western and Chinese meals, and guiding them around the entire city of San Francisco. Their kindness and sincerity are truly appreciated. Through this, I was also able to gain a brief understanding of the situation of the overseas Chinese in San Francisco in recent years.</p>
<p>The place where the overseas Chinese in San Francisco live is called Chinatown. I have long been familiar with its name from geography books and have often heard people say that Chinatown is extremely dirty and the atmosphere is very bad. Americans often regard it as uncivilized, which almost made me afraid to set foot in it during this trip to the United States. However, after arriving in Chinatown, I felt that this statement was not credible. Although most of the shops are small in scale, I have not found any facts to prove that it is extremely dirty or that the atmosphere is corrupt. Later, I heard from the overseas Chinese that the situation in Chinatown was indeed not good before 1906. After the great earthquake of 1906, many houses were rebuilt, and Chinatown also changed its old appearance. In recent years, due to the prevailing trend, the overseas Chinese have gradually learned to cherish themselves, and the situation in the streets has become more and more improved. Therefore, the so-called Chinatown being extremely dirty and the atmosphere being corrupt are historical terms. "A scholar should be looked at with new eyes after three days apart." Can Chinatown not be regarded in this way?</p>
<p>The strictness of the organization of the overseas Chinese in San Francisco is said to be the best among the overseas Chinese in various parts of the United States. The largest organization is the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, whose English name is Chinese Six Company. This is because when the Chinese first arrived in the Americas in 1849, there were only six people. Now, the number of provinces has far exceeded this number, so the Six Companies has also been renamed the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, but Americans still call it by the old name. The next largest group is the Chinese American Citizen Alliance (C. A. C. A.), and groups formed by the combination of several surnames. Among them, the "National Protection General Association" formed by the combination of the four surnames Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Zhao is the most powerful. I once visited its office, which had very good buildings. In the middle are the images of Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhao Yun, with excellent paintings. When the descendants of the four surnames see them, recalling the scene of their ancestors' gathering together in those years, it should increase some sense of unity.</p>
<p>It is said that the views of the overseas Chinese in San Francisco have gradually changed in recent years. In the past, many people were only concerned with settling down in the United States and did not think of their homeland, but now they are very reluctant to leave their motherland and take pride in their children being able to establish themselves in their home country. Therefore, they pay great attention to the education of their children, and they attach equal importance to Chinese and Western education. During the day, they are required to attend American schools, and from 5 to 8 pm, they study Chinese at Chinese schools, with some still studying the Four Books and Five Classics. As I have seen, the children in school are mostly strong and lively, probably because they have long been accustomed to Americanization?</p>
<p>The public welfare organizations run by the overseas Chinese in San Francisco include the Chinese YMCA, the Chinese YWCA, Tung Wah Hospital, and many schools, all of which are quite impressive. Among them, the convenience of the YMCA and YWCA for visiting overseas Chinese, and the Tung Wah Hospital's comparison to well-known American hospitals are particularly commendable. Many Chinese newspapers have also been published, such as the Young China Morning Post and the National Daily. Unfortunately, they are each affiliated with a certain faction or system in the motherland, and there are intense mutual attacks, involving the private morals of important figures of various factions, which is a loss of the style of the journalistic world. If Americans also understood Chinese characters, wouldn't the pillars of the party and the country today be mistakenly regarded as worthless?</p>
<p>The various shops run by the overseas Chinese in Chinatown have everything, and it can truly be called an independent town. The main feature is that most of them are small businesses. There are hotels such as the Republic Hotel, the Grand View Hotel, and the New China Hotel, etc. The prices are not expensive, with the lowest being about half a US dollar per day. The YMCA and YWCA also offer accommodation at similar prices. The largest restaurants are "New Shanghai" and "Xing Hua Lou," etc., and many foreigners eat and dance there. Truly, "there is a commonality in taste."</p>

<h3>The Dagong Vocational School Moves into its New School Building</h3>
<p>Lin Meiyan, the principal of Dagong Vocational School in Nanshi, this city, has been painstakingly operating and planning carefully. Since the founding of the school, the school's operations have gradually developed, and the number of students has increased. Seeing that the old school building was insufficient, he specially found a site of 30 mu on Longhua Road near Jumen Road. Then, Wu Tiecheng, Wu Kaixian, and Wu Xingya, the standing school board members, raised donations from social figures and those who are enthusiastic about production education and issued construction bonds. Fortunately, they were able to accumulate little by little. Therefore, in May of this year, they began to build the most modern cement and steel school building. It is heard that the school's new school building has now been completed. There is a school building named "Vocational Education Hall," with three floors and a total of 36 rooms. The arrangement is that the first floor is used for various offices, conference halls, libraries, reading rooms, typing rooms, consumer cooperatives, and the auditorium, etc. The second floor is used for classrooms. The third floor is used for student dormitories, analytical chemistry laboratories, general chemistry laboratories, Taigong Bank, and drafting rooms, etc. From the 7th to the 9th of this month, all the school's items were moved in by the faculty and students automatically. The order was orderly and the work was fast. It is also heard that the school also has large-scale factories, faculty and staff dormitories, female student dormitories, and student washrooms, etc., which are also under construction. After the project is completely completed, a completion ceremony and a parents' day will be held.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Tang Wan Elementary School Holds a Completion Ceremony for its New School Building Today</h3>
<p>The Municipal Tang Wan Elementary School in Tangjiawan, Lao Ximen, this city, built a new school building last year because the original school building was insufficient. It was completed during the summer vacation this year. The school is scheduled to hold a completion ceremony today (Monday). The school was originally private. At the beginning of its founding, only seven students came to study. Under the painstaking management and enthusiastic planning of the current Principal Ms. Lu Yunqian, the achievements have been remarkable. Since it was changed to municipal in the 12th year of the Republic of China, the school's operations and students have developed even more. The school building has been moved three times. Finally, the leased buildings were narrow and inconvenient. Therefore, Principal Lu went around and requested the Education Hall Bureau to allocate funds to build a mansion. Now the entire project has been completed, and the completion ceremony will be held at 10 am today. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, will personally attend to give instructions. The school has also opened up six rooms to display student achievements for people to exhibit. In the afternoon, various art performances will be performed to add to the fun. In the evening, movies will be shown to entertain the guests. There are many gifts sent by various circles, with a dazzling array that is a feast for the eyes. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<h3>Jewish Team Crushed to Pieces: Tung Wah Wins 8 to 1</h3>
<p>Dai, Chen, Cao, and Jia, Excellent Collaboration</p>
<p>Jewish Team Loses Form, Offense and Defense Both Difficult</p>
<p>Tung Wah, undefeated in battle, met the Jewish team, which had previously defeated the China team, yesterday at the Shen Garden for a Group A match. Spectators were concerned that Li Yichen's suspension would mean the loss of a good forward, impacting the team's offensive power. Furthermore, the Jewish forwards were known to be fierce and lively. Therefore, before the match, many spectators worried for Tung Wah's chances. However, after the start of the game, Tung Wah relied on their well-honed coordination and accurate, fast shooting, creating a momentum like splitting bamboo. They scored six consecutive goals in the first half. Although the Jewish team managed to break the duck in the second half with Hong Guang's goal, Tung Wah intensified their efforts, adding two more goals. The final score was 8 to 1. This match is considered Tung Wah's masterpiece of the season.</p>
<p>Dai Zhongjun Scores Twice</p>
<p>The Jewish team kicked off and attacked eastward. After a few back-and-forths, the ball fell into Gu Shangxiang's hands, who transferred it to the forward line. Cao Qiuting broke through, with Dai Linjing following closely. Hastan cleared the ball halfway, but Cao tried again. Xiao Wan arrived in time, making a short pass to the center. Center forward Dai, with his unpredictable footwork, broke through the goal, eliciting cheers from the crowd. Shortly after, Jia Youliang tumbled into the enemy's danger zone. Goerfei was too late to turn around, and Hastan rushed to meet him head-on. Jia Youliang, as cunning as a mountain hare, weaved his feet, and Linjing stepped forward, sending the ball into the goal.</p>
<p>Small Passes by Jia and Feng Result in Two Victories</p>
<p>Despite losing two goals, the Jewish team's bad luck continued. Their forwards couldn't counter-attack, and their defenders made mistakes easily. The Tung Wah flag was seen everywhere in the penalty area. The five forwards were as lively as dragons and tigers, astonishing the gods. Cao Qiuting possessed the courage of a hero, disregarding Gao Ge's defenses and penetrating the lines as if entering an uninhabited land. Jia Youliang launched a surprise attack, shooting with a diagonal and wonderful trajectory, directly hitting the left corner. Di Quque was in shock, staring blankly, unsure of what to do. Hong Guang passed the ball forward from afar. Hastan and Jiaqiu were entangled. Gelinbo leaped up, heading the ball into a corner. Wan Aihu picked up the ball and sent it to the center, and Da Bogong fired a cold shot, making the score 4-0.</p>
<p>Massacre Further Fuels the Fire</p>
<p>The Jewish team was now showing even more vulnerability. The entire team of warriors was breathless and panicked, their embarrassment fully exposed, especially goalkeeper Di Quque, who was flustered and made numerous mistakes. Xiao Wan took another corner kick. Jiaqiu selflessly let Dai Yuanzhang take the shot, who swept it in with his leg. Soon after, Goerfei's clumsy hands were spotted by the referee, who immediately awarded a penalty kick. Hong Guang casually kicked the ball, but Di Quque, like a frightened bird, although touching it, could not keep it far. Gu Shangxiang descended from the sky and easily got the ball.</p>
<p>Hong Guang "The Guest" Hosts</p>
<p>After the break, the Jewish spectators outside the field shouted and cheered to boost morale. The players on the field were invigorated and determined, making several incursions into Tung Wah's territory. Li Ning swung his broadsword, killing like a demon. The Jewish team attacked repeatedly but failed, their anxiety evident on their faces. Haixueke made a long pass in front of the Tung Wah goal. Hong Guang jumped up for a header, but unexpectedly, the ball betrayed his head, escaping into the net. The Jewish team gained a goal without shedding a drop of blood, their joy was evident. Soon after, S. Gelinbo came to shoot again, accurately and rapidly, but the ball rebounded off the goalpost, leaving him only to sigh and lament in vain.</p>
<p>8-1, Tung Wah Celebrates Victory</p>
<p>After a long battle between the two sides, the situation evened out. Gu Shangxiang led a mutiny, with ten thousand horses galloping. Cao, Chen, and Jia supported Dai on stage, their momentum overwhelming. "Little Cao Man forced the writing of the Shanyang Memorial," making it 6-1. Jia Youliang was still not satisfied, probing the border areas. Goerfei, not recognizing Mount Tai, led the wolf into the house. Chen Jiaqiu provided supplies to the center, and Wan Xianghua was ordered to raise the flag of righteousness, aiming a cannon at the corner of the goal, resulting in the eighth breach of the Jewish goal.</p>

<h3>Ring Road Long-Distance Race: Wang Zhengling Wins Champion</h3>
<p>Time: Seventeen Minutes and Forty Seconds</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the faint morning light and misty air, over a hundred long-distance running athletes from the Chinese Single-Item Track and Field Competition Promotion Association gathered in front of the Chen Ying Shi Memorial Tower at the Old West Gate. At the sound of the six o'clock standard bell, they started together. They ran swiftly, all vying for the lead. The fastest starters were Wang Zhengling, Yang Qingxie, Liang Chenxingpei and others. Later, Lan Junjie, Jin Zhonglian, and Xu Yanbo joined the lead. The competition was intense along the way, and the spectators on the roadside were packed like sardines. One lap around the Sanlu Circular Road was 7538 meters, which was easily covered. Wang Zhengling reached the finish line amidst thunderous applause, beating second-place Xu Yanbo by over a hundred meters. Zhang Liang, who fought fiercely with the second place runner, came in third, only half a foot behind. Following him were Wan Jinxie, and then Chen Xingpei and Guan Youwen, running shoulder to shoulder. The intensity of the competition can be imagined. Prizes were awarded to 20% of the participants. Gao Zhifang, a student from the police training institute, who had previously ranked eighth in a long-distance race, participated again this time, which was commendable. After the race, Miss Zou Shande presented the awards. The first place winner received a silver shield from Cheng Yize, the second place winner received a silver shield from the mayor, and the others received commemorative medals.

<h3>Men's Doubles Final</h3>

It was unlike the lackluster singles final the day before. De Ka's partnership was perfect, with no gaps to exploit. Qiu and Peng were comparatively weaker, their serves and smashes not as effective. Furthermore, De Ka's two players blocked the net, and Qiu and Peng repeatedly failed to break through, eventually losing. In the first set, the server always won, but Qiu lost the seventh game, and De Ka won 6-4. In the second set, De Ka led 4-1 and 5-3, but Qiu and Peng tied it at 5-5. However, they still lost 9-7.

<h3>On "Luigi Pirandello"</h3>
<p>— Jing Zhi</p>
<p>— The Winner of This Year's Nobel Prize in Literature</p>
<p>According to an Havas dispatch on the 8th of this month, this year's Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to the Italian playwright and novelist Luigi Pirandello.</p>
<p>This writer's works have been introduced to a considerable extent in China. He was born in Sicily in 1897, graduated from the University of Bonn, and after returning to his home country, he served as a professor at the Higher Normal School for Women in Rome, while also engaging in literary creation. He has written many novels, poems, and plays. In his home country, he is a "very popular" writer, and his works sell widely.</p>
<p>Although Pirandello is a writer of the Latin race, he was influenced by Northern European literature in his literary work. Some say that all of his works show the influence of Strindberg, even more than Ibsen. This, of course, refers to the pessimistic and world-weary color in Pirandello's works.</p>
<p>However, Pirandello fundamentally has different aspects from Strindberg. Strindberg's pessimistic thinking is so-called "Northern European style." He views the ultimate of life with a gloomy and pessimistic eye, but he does not see "reality" as a meaningless mass of chaos. Pirandello is different. His plays and novels make the audience feel that everything is unstable, a mess, and meaningless—the protagonists in his works are almost all modern Hamlets, without any purpose in life. These characters are all defeated soldiers in life; they are neither profound people, nor people who can muster any energy. Their attitude towards life is like that of a person with no hope squatting in a corner and watching coldly. They are afraid to think about the future, and they are not dissatisfied with the present. They feel that nothing can be certain. In "The Late Mattia Pascal," the protagonist, Mattia Pascal, says: "Among the few things, there is one thing, perhaps only this one thing, that I dare to be certain of, and that is that I am called Mattia Pascal." But later, this Pascal dared not even be confident that he was called "Mattia Pascal."</p>
<p>Pirandello's work is a symbol of this old world that has lost all self-confidence!</p>
<p>Here, we should think that the established purpose of the Nobel Literature Prize Committee is to give this prize to the best idealistic writers. Therefore, almost none of the naturalistic and old realist writers who expose reality have ever won the prize. But today, it seems quite difficult to find "healthy and positive idealistic writers," so this time the prize had to be given to the pessimistic and skeptical Pirandello. The Nobel Literature Prize Committee is probably extremely "troubled" when it has to find a recipient for the prize once a year, right? But fortunately, there is always Pirandello!</p>
<h3>Sinclair Finally Loses Election</h3>
<p>— Lin Huanping</p>
<p>In the past few months, during the preliminary election for the Governor of California in the United States, the world-renowned socialist writer Sinclair topped the list in the primary vote and was elected. This immediately caused a sensation around the world. Some in the US and international media said that Sinclair had abandoned his socialist views to help President Roosevelt save the US from the economic downturn. However, the majority believed that Sinclair's emergence on the political stage indicated, on the one hand, that US politics were shifting to the left after the US's resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, that President Roosevelt was leaning towards revolution. Consequently, this faction of the media desperately attacked Sinclair's election as a candidate for Governor of California. Why was Sinclair elected as a gubernatorial candidate? If he were to become governor, how would he govern California? He published a manifesto-like article explaining how he was elected as a gubernatorial candidate and his two-year plan for governing California in the future. The original article was very long. Here is a summary of its main points, with some explanations below.</p>
<p>He first explained that his family had been Democrats for generations, and he himself was as well. He greatly admired the words of Thomas Jefferson, the founder of the Democratic Party: "Humans are not born with a majority destined to have backs burdened with saddles, and a minority born with the legal right to ride on those saddles." He hoped that these words would not only apply to the fields of politics and governance but also to the fields of commerce and industry. However, the Democratic Party later failed to implement such a platform as the founders had intended, so he joined the Social Democratic Party, a party of a new era. He said that he had spent thirty-nine years as a writer, enduring many hardships, but he was always willing to dedicate himself to social causes. He had been nominated three times by the California Social Democratic Party: twice as a candidate for governor and once as a candidate for the US Senate. He even received a high vote count of 60,000. He said that initially, Democratic gentlemen wrote to him, urging him to join the Democratic Party and requesting that he agree to be recommended as the Democratic Party's candidate for Governor of California in 1934. Furthermore, one night in August 1933, a meeting was held with five Democratic state legislators in attendance. The discussion at that meeting centered on having Sinclair join the Democratic Party as their gubernatorial candidate for California. Moreover, Mr. Stevenson even said, "If that's the case, he will win the votes of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, especially the youth. Even progressive Republicans would likely come over to the Democratic Party to support him, no fewer than 100,000." He then explained that, like all good Americans, he supported President Roosevelt's NRA (National Recovery Act) for the recovery of the United States. However, he said that its failure was undeniable. According to the government's collected data, production only reached the level of 1926. Employment was only 70% of what it was then, and wages were only 50%. He was convinced that under capitalism, at least half of the current unemployed would never be able to find work again. Therefore, he said that if he were elected as the bankrupt governor of fifty-eight bankrupt counties and one hundred bankrupt cities and towns, the first cornerstone of his political platform would be to provide the unemployed with productive work so that they could support themselves. The first condition of our new political agenda is to pay attention to this issue. People's lives and well-being are the first condition. We must recognize that people in the state have the right to own land or be closely connected to the land, giving them the means of production. What we should do is return the unemployed to the land (i.e., return to farming). Therefore, he advocated for collective settlements for the unemployed. He wanted to promote a third form of agriculture, different from the two existing forms in California. That is, the establishment of collective settlements managed by trained personnel under the auspices of the state. There, he would build suitable housing for workers, communal kitchens, light dining halls, and social spaces. Initially, it would guarantee a livelihood, and when it was quite successful, it would guarantee comfort. This would give all unemployed men and women in California the opportunity to be fully self-sufficient. Not only that, but he also said that all collective settlements should have libraries, movie theaters, and lecture halls advocating public ownership, becoming cultural centers. If I were to become the Governor of California, I would ensure that all men, women, and children have the opportunity for self-education, not only physically but also intellectually, morally, and aesthetically. He also said that we must have public companies to manage the development of collective settlements and other public companies to handle production. We must have laundries, bakeries, canneries, clothing and shoe factories, cement factories, brick kilns, lumber mills, and so on. This would have nothing to do with contemporary speculators and exploiters. He wanted to build a completely vocational organization for a new world of self-sustaining unemployed people. All collective settlements should have stores selling factory products, and all factories should have kitchens, light dining halls, and markets selling agricultural products. This organization must have transportation vehicles to transport factory products to collective settlements and food to factories. Workers would use vouchers to buy and sell goods. He also proposed that California issue small-denomination bonds of ten US dollars, some with low interest, some long-term, and some for thirty days. This would be virtually the same as a public savings bank. Bonds would be used as state currency. This would allow the public to withdraw money from private banks and give it to the state government to develop the state's industrial organization. He advocated that families with incomes of less than $3,000 should be completely exempt from taxes, and those with incomes between $3,000 and $5,000 should pay taxes at the normal rate, with an additional 1/2% for every additional $5,000. Families with incomes of $100,000 would have to pay 11% in taxes. Those who refused to pay would have their homes confiscated and used as state-run institutions to house orphans, the elderly, or people suffering from lung diseases from working twelve hours a day as slaves.</p>
<p>The above is Sinclair's own account of his election as a gubernatorial candidate and an overview of his two-year plan for governing California. At its core, it is nothing more than the establishment of collective settlements. These collective settlements are quite similar to the collective farms in the Soviet Union. However, the rapid development of collective farms in the Soviet Union has special political and economic organizations as support. Assuming Sinclair could actually be elected as the Governor of California, whether he could implement this plan in the current United States remains a question. If so, his simple slogan, "End poverty in California!" will be just talk, written on paper, like the once sensational "Technocracy" of two or three years ago.</p>
<p>According to recent news, Sinclair has been defeated by his political opponent Merriam. Mr. Sinclair was unable to gain political power, and his policies will naturally be impossible to implement.</p>
<h3>"Delicious Boats"</h3>
<p>— Yin Guang</p>
<p>A friend of mine, who loves to tell jokes, calls these kinds of boats "Delicious Boats."</p>
<p>The external appearance of a Delicious Boat is not significantly different from ordinary wooden boats. Only the middle and rear cabins are made into the shape of houses with wooden boards and thicker bamboo mats. Windows are also opened on both sides, resembling large yachts on West Lake. The hull is often very new-looking, as if it had just been launched. I have almost never seen one that looks old and brownish due to the wear and tear of wind and rain.</p>
<p>At several docks above Yichang, as long as there is a relatively prosperous market, as soon as a steamer docks, these Delicious Boats will latch onto the stern of the steamer, almost like ghosts. But they are only there during mooring; if it's a short anchor drop, these types of boats won't be seen.</p>
<p>"Going?" When it's quiet at night, some friends who often travel around the rivers and lakes point their chins upwards and invite each other. Then two or three of them together, wearing slippers, walk down to the kitchen with a "slap, slap" sound, and from there, enter another small world.</p>
<p>On the bow, there are usually stoves, food stalls, wine, meat, and other snacks. In the middle cabin, on both sides along the windows, there are two unpainted square tables each. If you only want to eat a bowl of noodles, or fermented rice with egg, or drink an ounce or two of "cellar wine," you can just stay here and don't need to go into the rear cabin.</p>
<p>The door there is bolted shut. Above the door curtain, there is usually a small wooden plaque with humorous inscriptions like "A Different World" or "Shangri-La." But the guests who come in, regardless of whether they enter the secret-like place behind the thin curtain that emits an enticing light, before ordering food, always use two fingers to open a slit in the somewhat mysterious curtain, bend over and peek inside, sniff, and say, "Smells good." Then they turn back to the table.</p>
<p>At this time, the "waiter" has already strolled in from the bow, stands by the table, lazily pulls down the rag draped over his shoulder, and asks:</p>
<p>"Drinking?"</p>
<p>"Oh, look, wipe it clean," the guest points to the oil stains on the table and says.</p>
<p>Some are just there to fill their stomachs, and after eating a bowl of noodles, they wipe their mouths with their palms and return to the steamer. But some first order tea and drink it leisurely, as if sitting in a teahouse on the shore. After slowly arranging the dishes, they take five or six chopsticks from a pile of bamboo chopsticks on the table, choosing a matching one. Then they ask for draft paper or tear off a piece of the window curtain, polishing the utensils as if cleaning a gun. From them, you can't see any haste, only stagnation and annoying nagging.</p>
<p>These kinds of customers are mostly private merchants, smugglers of pistols and opium. After finishing their wine and food, they hiccup drunkenly and call out to the waiter, "Listen carefully? Bring the tea here." Then they stagger into the rear cabin.</p>
<p>Inside, there are two rough white wooden beds placed facing each other. The layout is also very simple, with only a thin layer of straw, a straw mat, and a blue cloth coverlet. The pillow is already very old, with the middle part sunken, just like a saddle. The white cloth pillowcase is covered with hair oil, stained with dirt.</p>
<p>"Southern soil?" the "opium craftsman" with a handkerchief tied around his head leans forward and asks.</p>
<p>"Good..." the guest replies, leaning back onto the pillow. After getting comfortable, he half-closes his bloodshot eyes, scratches his thigh, and mutters in a "sick of it" tone:</p>
<p>"No big sleeves?" (Note)</p>
<p>"You've come at a time when we're banning it here," the person with the handkerchief replies with a smile.</p>
<p>But the guest has already started to snore softly.</p>
<p>This kind of lingering mostly ends late at night. The guests are not necessarily all smoking, and they are not necessarily just "getting their fix." They are mostly just bored. After smoking one or two small boxes, they become energetic and start bragging. They always talk about secret events, belonging to this port, this section of the river, or even just this docked steamer. And the breadth of that scope can truly be called profound.</p>
<p>"Oh, really,...getting a mistress again?"</p>
<p>"It's the daughter of Old Chen with the red eyes in that shack. Her mother was a rotten piece a long time ago..."</p>
<p>The opium craftsman starts to do historical analysis.</p>
<p>But no matter how interesting this place is, first and second-class passengers absolutely don't come here. Even those who are more neatly dressed in third class would rather curl up on the bunk, which is like a horse trough, and chew on the loneliness of the journey. However, even in this small world, there are no other more respectable faces. Isn't it enough to see the variegation of our social life!</p>
<p>Note: When smoking opium, it is women who act as opium craftsmen, commonly called "big sleeve opium." The "big sleeve" here refers to the female opium craftsman.</p>
<h3>River and Lake Traveler (IV)</h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>He would stay in this small town for a few days every year, and almost regularly, after the azaleas cried themselves hoarse for the lush summer and finally had to flee with their families, he would appear in response to the season. Therefore, the children in this small town all knew him and chased after him, shouting "Xiangfu" (Spice Vendor).</p>
<p>He stayed at the small inn on Heng Street every year. The signboard of this inn was so old that it was beyond memory. Because it had received a distinguished guest during the Xianfeng era, it was still famous along with the deeds of that distinguished guest. But it had long shown signs of decline. Since the opening of the train, travelers no longer needed to stay overnight; moreover, businesses everywhere had been sluggish in recent years, so several guests had also stayed near the station, mostly staying in the warehouses. Therefore, after dozing off, the innkeeper and waiter could still remember that this old guest had stayed here eight times before, one of which was during the war, when the old guest had sold all the "Xiangfu" elsewhere. In total, since the old guest came to this town, nine unfortunate years had passed.</p>
<p>What was he called? Only the waiter knew that strange name; however, it was only for the first two or three years, after which everyone called him "Old Guest" or "Xiangfu," and soon they forgot it.</p>
<p>Around August, the waiter would jump up from his laziness, as if excited to gather his "family," and loudly proclaim:</p>
<p>"Get ready, 'Xiangfu' is coming! Erguo Pao (the best Baijiu) Baisao. Conscience, oh conscience! Woe woe..."</p>
<p>He imitated the appearance of dispensing wine, his humor made people laugh, and the sweat on his nose also came out. Then he proudly extended his thumb and raised it up:</p>
<p>"Nanhai Xiangfu... a wild goose!"</p>
<p>He was really happy, like waiting for an old friend. Sure enough, soon "Xiangfu" came with the first wild goose.</p>
<p>"Xiangfu" was different from other "river and lake" people.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows the situation on the rivers and lakes knows that when they are idle, they hide in remote places to gamble, using all their ingenuity, saying words that are more intimate than even close brothers. It is also at this time that they use seemingly fair methods to swindle the money they have cheated from others. They talk about women, seduce other people's wives, and fight with weapons. If there is any time left over, they discuss scams or devise ways to trick the innkeeper. Perhaps it was only because of one person that he spent all his spare time by the water.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Pathological State of Chinese Industry</h3>
<p>— Zhao Wanping</p>
<p>Since China felt the economic pressure from European and American powers and realized the importance of its own industrial development, it has been several decades now. However, during this period, various attempts at development have repeatedly risen and fallen, but have never been able to create a relatively lasting, complete, and respectable industry within the country. Thus, we have watched as some industries flourished for a time, only to wither and decline like fallen leaves. Many modern industries have simply been unable to establish themselves, and the weak and powerless handicrafts have collapsed one after another. Here, we cannot help but ask, what kind of illness is Chinese industry suffering from?</p>
<p>If China's industrial underdevelopment is due to an illness, then that illness must be a complicated and difficult one, certainly not a common headache or cold that can be cured with any readily available medicine, like Veramon or Aspirin. Therefore, anyone interested in saving Chinese industry will undoubtedly agree that to cure the current ailments of Chinese industry, it is necessary to first carefully diagnose it, understand the source of its illness, and then proceed step by step to prescribe the appropriate medicine.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to present, in brief, the impressions gained by the author through daily observation, for the consideration of those with similar interests. Because these are merely impressions, I do not intend to offer any rigid conclusions or burdensome statistical data here, as they are not necessarily essential.</p>
<p>Among the points mentioned below, some are already commonly heard refrains. However, we cannot ignore the existence of these facts simply because they are common refrains. However, the author is very ashamed that his knowledge is too inadequate. If he were to practice medicine, he could only aspire to be an itinerant quack.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the calamities and diseases currently afflicting Chinese industry can be divided into two categories: external pressures, or what we might call external pathogens; and inherent defects, or what we might call internal weaknesses.</p>
<p>(1) External Pressures</p>
<p>The harm that external pressures inflict on Chinese industry is obvious and widespread. For example, as we often cite, during the European War, European and American countries were busy engaging in war, and loosened their grip on the economic life of the Far East. As a result, China's various industries suddenly loosened up and became more vibrant. In particular, the cotton textile industry was like a horse freed from its reins, encountering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and developing vigorously. However, the European War ended, peace was restored, and bad luck returned. Because at this time, various countries reorganized and charged in to regain their lost markets. Chinese industry was no match for them, and thus suffered repeated defeats, losing soldiers and generals, eventually reaching the point of total collapse today. The pressure of foreign goods in the domestic market is a clear example of this.</p>
<p>Among these intrusions of foreign forces, Japan's is the most aggressive. According to a report in the News on September 24 of this year, eighty-five industrial product manufacturing and marketing organizations in the major cities of Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto in Japan have decided to jointly sell Japanese goods in Shanghai at low prices, and plan to expand into the interior at any time. According to recent reports, Japan is also trying to open Japanese goods exhibitions in China.</p>
<p>In the Chinese market, Japanese goods are the most irreconcilable with domestic goods. Industrial products imported from Europe and America are those that Chinese industry cannot produce under the current conditions, whether in terms of technology, economy, or production materials. However, Japanese industrial products are different. Like us, they find it difficult to hope for the development of heavy industry, and therefore can only focus on light industry as the standard for large-scale manufacturing. The living standards and daily needs of their people are also similar to ours, so their industrial products are well-suited to our tastes, which is something that European and American industries cannot match. Thus, in many areas, the industries of China and Japan often experience serious conflicts of market competition. When we try to save Chinese industry, we will also treat Japan as the primary target.</p>
<p>For decades, an unfortunate constraint has restricted the sales of domestic industrial products, making them unable to compete with foreign trade. This was the likin tax paid at customs and checkpoints. In recent years, the government has resolutely abolished the likin tax, which has brought considerable benefits to industry. This wise measure and painful decision by the government deserve our praise. Abolishing decades of corrupt policies is not an easy task.</p>
<p>In the past three years, the government has finally gained the power of tariff autonomy. In many cases, it has also tried its best to protect domestic industry. However, Chinese industry is still in its infancy, and the need for protection is more urgent and the degree of protection needed is deeper. Therefore, in many cases, the tax rates set by the government are still insufficient to protect domestic industry. We are not saying that this is solely the government's responsibility. There must be a limit to how high the government raises protective tariffs, unless the industry is necessary for the foundation of the nation. The government must also consider the interests of consumers. For example, the government could impose heavy taxes on the import of certain cultural papers to protect the domestic paper industry. However, if domestic paper mills were to use their current equipment to produce these cultural papers, the price would be higher than that of imported goods. This would undoubtedly increase the cost of culture and hinder its development.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two difficult issues that we must also consider. The first is whether the government's external position allows it to arbitrarily increase tariffs. The second is that most of the government's revenue comes from tariffs. Now that many export taxes have been reduced or eliminated, if the import taxes on foreign goods are increased to the point where they cannot be imported, would the government not lose a huge amount of tax revenue?</p>
<p>In the international market, Chinese industrial products are also often squeezed out by the manufactured goods of other countries. The annual decline in exports of silk and tung oil is partly due to the general decline in global purchasing power, but a large part is also due to the rise of manufacturing in consuming countries and the competition from other countries' goods.</p>
<p>A dozen years ago, a large quantity of tung oil was exported from the Yangtze River area to Europe and America. Because the market demand was high at that time, but no country could produce it. In recent years, the United States brought tung seeds back for trial planting, and the results were very satisfactory. Although the scale may not be very large, the impact on the export volume of Chinese tung oil has already been significant. No one dares to say what the final outcome will be. Now, not only the United States is trying to plant it, but Japan also harbors ambitions and is trying to buy seeds and conduct preliminary trials in Korea, in order to increase production in the future and seize all of China's markets.</p>
<p>Carpets woven in the Tianjin area have always relied heavily on the American market. Recently, the United States has also been able to set up factories to manufacture coarser carpets using machines. The import tax on carpets imported into the United States has been increased. As a result, many factories in Beijing that weave crude carpets have lost a large part of their sales and are difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Not long ago, China also had a relatively large trade with the South Seas Islands. Now, many markets have been seized by Japanese goods. Yellow cardboard produced in China was once sold to the South Seas Islands, but the situation has changed greatly in the past year or two. Japanese goods are rampant everywhere, and domestic goods have no ability to resist.</p>
<p>Although some of the external pressures cannot be overcome or resisted by the strength of Chinese industry itself, we must also admit that some of them are due to its own unsoundness, or can be salvaged through its own efforts to improve. The failures of silk, tea, and tung oil are all due to their own lack of progress and unwillingness to learn. In addition, several emerging industries, such as the enamelware industry and the thermos bottle manufacturing industry, have indeed driven foreign goods out of the country through the efforts of the Chinese people. Even Japanese goods, which have always been known for their beauty and low prices, have had to retreat. This shows the true ability of Chinese industry. If we can handle things well, then the pressure from foreign goods, no matter how tight, will not be enough to put us to death!</p>
<p>Therefore, to resist the competition from foreign goods, in addition to political power, we must also rely on the industrial sector itself to find a way out, such as improving the quality of products, reducing costs, creating a national atmosphere of loving and using domestic goods, and uniting various factories to increase strength. In the past year or two, domestic manufacturers have been able to consciously rejuvenate themselves, and various domestic goods movements have been very active, and they are constantly expanding into the interior. This situation did not exist before, and it must be said to be a good sign of progress.</p>
<p>(2) Inherent Defects</p>
<p>A. Economic. The lack of capital is the biggest fatal flaw hindering the development of Chinese industry. This is because China has always been a country filled with poor people, and these poor people have never known how to use their meager capital for production. Therefore, the amount of capital that can enter the financial market as industrial capital or cash to adjust industrial needs is very limited. The turnover and activity of industry are therefore restricted everywhere.</p>
<p>Because of the instability of Chinese industry, banks often adopt cautious and strict measures when lending to them. Some conservative and prudent banks simply refuse to make industrial loans, and even watch an industry collapse without offering help. This makes industry feel particularly painful when it urgently needs to borrow money. The financial and industrial sectors should help each other and work together to open up a path. This is the most urgent problem to be solved now.</p>
<p>The fluctuation of international exchange rates also has a great impact on Chinese industry. For example, when the exchange rate of silver rises, not only can foreign goods have a way to invade the Chinese market and break the original camp of Chinese industry, but also some industries with export trade are in danger of losing their original market. Exchange rates can also affect other countries; however, their industrial strength is strong and they can temporarily endure the losses caused by exchange rate fluctuations. Chinese industry is weak and cannot withstand it! Naturally, it cannot stand its ground. Furthermore, China has little standing in international debt or other issues, and is always passive. Other countries can freely manipulate international exchange rates to benefit their own countries, while we can only swallow our anger and endure it. Such losses are unique to China.</p>
<p>China cannot use all of its industries to supply domestic consumption, and at the same time, it needs to import many foreign goods. Then it must have a considerable amount of goods to export to make up for a batch of international debts. If the exported products are unique to China, then there is no problem. Otherwise, serious difficulties will come upon it.</p>
<p>China does not have its own ocean-going ships that go directly to foreign countries. Even in the case of nearby Japan and the South Seas Islands, there is not a single domestic ship. If domestic factories have manufactured goods to transport to the South Seas Islands, they must be loaded on ships of other countries, such as the merchant ships of Japanese and Dutch companies. In this way, they can arbitrarily manipulate the freight rates, and Chinese manufacturers have no way to deal with them. If a batch of goods is to be loaded on a Japanese ship to the South Seas, and this type of goods is likely to compete with Japanese products, then the clever and patriotic owner of the Japanese shipping company will demand extremely high freight rates, adding a very painful burden to Chinese manufacturers. At the same time, they will gladly reduce the freight rates for the Japanese goods they carry, and provide many conveniences during loading and unloading. It is very possible that this batch of Japanese goods may be loaded on the same ship as Chinese goods. Since Chinese goods have suffered such torture, the ability of the two countries' goods to compete after arriving in the South Seas is obvious.</p>
<p>B. Technical. The lack of technical talent is a matter of great concern to those who care about Chinese industrial problems. This is mostly due to the poor employment system. Many people have completed their studies, but are not appreciated, and many people want to find trained talent, but do not know where to go. Therefore, we often see many new factories employing technicians or engineering managers who are only experienced workers, not people who have received higher technical education. Their experience is undoubtedly shallow and outdated, and they will never have advanced knowledge. Such people are very dangerous in terms of morality and very lacking in terms of knowledge. It may be feasible for them to maintain the existing situation, but it is deeply regrettable to hope that they can develop or improve their business. To compete with such industries with foreign industries that have richer experience and superior knowledge, even a child can predict the outcome. Therefore, the lack of talent can be said to be a major obstacle hindering the development of Chinese industry. If this obstacle is not removed, Chinese industry will forever be in stagnation, in a stagnant and dying state.</p>
<p>In Chinese factories, it seems that no attention is paid to the management of the factory. They rarely think about which part of the work is unnecessary and can be reduced to save costs. Which part of the work is currently insufficient and must be increased to fully develop productivity. In other words, they rarely know how to use "work efficiency".</p>
<p>The employment system also has much room for improvement. The contracting system is clearly a primitive and uneconomical method. The factory pays the same wages as ordinary workers, but the work that the workers return is undoubtedly lower than that of ordinary workers, because the contracted workers have no direct contact with the factory and do not develop strong feelings. At the same time, since a part of their wages is occupied by the contractor, they receive very little actual wages, and naturally they will not work wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Employing relatives is a common habit in Chinese society, and it is inevitable that this will spread to industry. Every time we travel on a ship of a Chinese company, we cannot help but wonder why the deck at the bow is crowded with so many inexplicable people, talking loudly. They are obviously employed by the company to serve on the ship, but the ship is still so messy and dirty, and they are idle and oblivious. We are always surprised how the company can maintain so many people! But on Japanese ships, the situation is completely different. Although there are not many people employed, they are always scrubbing and working day and night, striving to keep the entire ship clean and beautiful. The difference between the two is too great. The same situation is not difficult to see in other industries. Needless to say, this has added a great burden to Chinese industry.</p>
<p>In terms of factory organization, there are often many unfortunate shortcomings. The short-sightedness of Chinese entrepreneurs, who often only see the present, is a major drawback.</p>
<p>For example, if a factory is about to open, and all its capital is only enough to buy two machines, then it will only buy two machines, and the position for placing the machines will only be enough for two machines. It does not care about anything else. Later, when the business develops, it will draw some capital to buy machines again. At this time, the staff may have changed, or for other possible reasons, the machines purchased may not be the same type or nature as the previous ones. Perhaps the previous purchase was a diesel engine, but this time it is a steam engine. We have even discovered such a situation. Sometimes, even in one process, there are various machines made in many countries. Since the location for placing the machines was not planned in advance, it is natural to have to create a new space temporarily.</p>
<p>In this way, work efficiency is very poor, and increases or decreases in production cannot reduce costs, because they cannot become a complete production unit.</p>
<p>Due to the above situation, we often encounter very strange phenomena. In some factories, there is no lack of excellent machinery and equipment, but the operators are people with no knowledge or ability. In some factories, the operators have considerable knowledge and ability, but are constrained by old machinery and find it difficult to develop. Under this deformed situation, the losses suffered by Chinese industry are truly incalculable.</p>
<p>C. Psychological. It is a generally recognized fact that Chinese entrepreneurs have a narrow vision. They only want to take care of their current interests and pay little attention to future results, and they also lack the ability to make any predictions. They often lack the proper, exploratory, and progressive mentality that an entrepreneur should have. If they are lucky enough to make money, they mostly shrink back. Therefore, it is difficult to expect large-scale development of various Chinese industries.</p>
<p>They also have a shameful habit, which is to stick to conventions and keep secrets. When they accidentally get some superficial understanding, they are very secretive, thinking that their method is the only way to succeed. Let's not talk about the handicrafts that use the signboard of ancestral secrets to attract customers. Even in modern industries, there is this phenomenon, which is really regrettable. At the same time, the general mentality of society is also to value ancestral and old brands, and not to seek novelty and progress. Therefore, when others' brand new and surprising things have already come out, they are still closing their eyes and covering their ears, holding up the ancestral signboard to show their importance. The result of this attitude is that the "secret method" is not passed on to others at that time, and the business cannot be universally developed. For oneself, it is stubborn and unchanging, and one is willing to lag behind.</p>
<p>Sticking to conventions is not only a characteristic of individual psychology, but also a natural result of the old Chinese economic organization. The original Chinese industries were all handicrafts. The success of this industry depends mostly on the skills of the craftsman. Therefore, the wages of workers are usually very high, at least higher than those of ancestral craftsmen. If the factory owner wants to dissolve the original factory all at once and start a completely new modern factory, then there is no problem. If his strength does not allow him to do so, he can only gradually find ways to improve, then he will suffer a strong resistance, that is, the opposition of the workers. The modernization of the production process, on the other hand, is the simplification of the production process. Once this reform is implemented, the value of skilled workers will plummet, and they will either be forced to retire or endure the same treatment as unskilled workers, which they cannot bear. The improvement of production methods may increase their workload, so if wages are not increased in the same way, they will also be actively or passively opposed; the progress of industry will be greatly hindered.</p>
<p>Chinese entrepreneurs also have a problem, which is that as long as there is profit to be made, everyone will flock to it, completely ignoring the overall situation. For example, in recent years, the bakelite industry has been very profitable, and everyone has rushed to it. As a result, there is overproduction, and everyone is desperately trying to sell at low prices, resulting in a bloody scene. Six or seven years ago, the yellow cardboard industry was also able to make a profit, so everyone started setting up factories to manufacture it, and at one time there were as many as six cardboard factories. How can the Chinese market sell so much output? The result of reckless competition is that both sides are injured, and those who lose money lose money, and those who go bankrupt go bankrupt. Now everyone has realized that they should unite with each other, but the big mistake has already been made. To promote sales to the South Seas Islands, there are Japanese goods as enemies, and there is no way. We can only agree to take turns stopping work to reduce stockpiles. The rubber industry was really popular two or three years ago, and everyone who saw it was envious. At that time, there were forty-eight factories in Shanghai alone, and the products produced were all the same. At that time, who would have thought of the tragic defeat of today. In addition, there are many industries that have failed for the same reasons, such as the enamelware industry and the electric bulb industry.</p>
<p>Chinese industry has suffered countless losses like this. Almost every emerging industry has this phenomenon. From this phenomenon, we see two things: first, a part of China's capital is now going to the industrial use, but it cannot find its way and does not know which way to go. Second, entrepreneurs are profit-oriented, but are unaware of the market supply and demand situation. They never thought about what kind of impact their shipments would have on the market.</p>
<p>In this regard, Swedish manufacturers are much smarter. According to Dr. Qian Chengxu's observations during his tour of Europe, the same type of goods is rarely manufactured in the same place in that country. The principle is to prevent competition within the industry, so as to maintain prices. They never make unplanned, crude products, and sometimes even avoid the sacrifice of competing with foreign goods, and use the country's capital on other profitable businesses.</p>
<p>We believe that China now has a part of its capital that wants to move to the industrial sector, but it is suffering from a lack of concrete knowledge. What we need now is how to come up with a way to guide these unsettled capital, so that they can go the way they want to go, develop their maximum effectiveness, and provide them with knowledge of market conditions at any time.</p>
<p>D. Natural. There is also a most fundamental difficulty in the development of Chinese industry, which is the lack of basic raw materials. In terms of raw materials for heavy industry, such as coal and iron, according to the estimates of the Geological Survey of Beiping in recent years, the total national output is not only not as surprisingly high as previously reported, but also most of the quality is very bad, and it is not suitable for the refined use of industry. The lack of other mineral raw materials is also very obvious.</p>
<p>The inadequacy and lack of agricultural raw materials is almost unbelievable. China is an agricultural country. According to ordinary people's views, it must be thought that there is no need to worry about this kind of raw materials. But the fact is quite wrong! Almost all the crops cultivated by Chinese farmers are grains and miscellaneous grains, and important items required for industry, such as forests, are pitifully scarce.</p>
<p>According to the third volume, issue 22 of the Industrial and Commercial Half-Daily, the raw materials that cannot be produced in China include fine cotton yarn, rayon, and other suitable raw materials, as well as saltpeter and potters, totaling sixteen types; the raw materials whose production price in China is higher than that of imported goods include felt hat blanks, asphalt, and beeswax, totaling three types; the raw materials that were previously produced in China but whose source has been cut off include purple stems, etc. What is included here is probably only the items seen in international trade, and it is certainly beyond doubt that it does not include everything. In the future, as industry gradually develops and the quantity and types of raw materials required increase, this situation will become more obvious.</p>
<p>Due to these natural limitations, Chinese industry is like suffering from a congenital deficiency, and it cannot stand without the supply of foreign raw materials. China has no colonies or overseas territories, and the source of these raw materials will inevitably rely on other countries. At this point, we can easily see the danger of Chinese industry. Its right to live or die will be completely in the hands of other countries. What a serious problem this is!</p>
<p>If we are determined to develop Chinese industry, then this problem of raw materials, that is, the problem of industrial food, must be solved first. However, this effort has a limit. Unless we plunder other people's land, mineral raw materials cannot be manufactured in large quantities by manpower, if natural endowments are very barren. Although the limitations on agricultural raw materials are not as severe as those on mineral raw materials, many plants are limited by soil and climate. Only with chemical raw materials can human efforts achieve greater results. There are already several small-scale chemical industrial companies in China. Two or three years ago, everyone initiated a chemical factory for rubber raw materials, and someone in the chemical industry also established a research association for domestic raw materials, with the aim of promoting the adoption or improvement of domestic raw materials by all sectors. Recently, sulfuric acid plants and alcohol plants are also being planned on a large scale, which shows that the Chinese people are working hard to overcome the difficulties of raw materials.</p>

<p>Call Loan Rate Steady, Spot Silver Slightly Up</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and as usual, the banking sector market was closed for the holiday, so there is nothing to report. Although the money shops conducted business as usual, their limited scope caused widespread inertia, resulting in an unusually dull market atmosphere. The market call loan rate for foreign currency remained at 1.2 cents in both the morning and afternoon, the same as the previous day. Call loan note transactions amounted to over 3.2 million in the morning session, with new transactions exceeding 500,000. Afternoon transactions totaled over 300,000, and transactions at the Small Exchange totaled over 500,000. Money shops' foreign currency collection amounted to over 34,000,000, and remittances from various routes amounted to over 50,000. Foreign currency loan transactions for redemption amounted to only over 300,000, with new loans made exceeding 800,000. Bank collections were completely suspended. In the subsidiary currency market, Jiangnan small silver dollars opened at 831 yuan in the morning session and rose to 834 yuan in the afternoon, resulting in an increase of three yuan compared to the previous day. Only 6,000 jiao were traded in the afternoon session, with no transactions in the morning. Guangdong small silver dollars were 747 yuan and 8 jiao in the morning session and 748 yuan in the afternoon, resulting in an increase of 7 jiao compared to the previous day. Trading volume was 110,000 jiao in the morning session and 50,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins were priced at 319,000 cash, the same as the previous day, with transactions valued at 8,800 foreign currency, equivalent to 28,072 strings of cash.</p>

<p>Bond Market Rose Steadily Last Week</p>
<p>——Increase of Several Cents to 1.34 Yuan——</p>
<p>Last week, from November 5th to 10th, the market trend of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was quite good. Although it had not completely broken free from consolidation, it was mostly on a steady upward trend, which was rare in recent weeks. Since the postponement of the Fifth National Congress and Chairman Chiang's inspection tours of various provinces, unity has been consistent wherever he went, and the situation in North China has become increasingly consolidated. Prominent figures in the Northwest are following the trend. Although there are some rumors created by villains, they are all unfounded. After the unity of all parties, the Southwest will also tend to be more consistent, and if there are no special accidents in the future, a grand unity can be gradually expected. However, the market chips have now gradually turned bullish, so supply and demand cannot be ignored. Last week, financial circles and northern groups bought in on Monday, and the 96 bond experienced an unconscious surge, rising by a full yuan. The bullish momentum of 96 bond did not abate on Tuesday, rising another half yuan, with strong buying interest from northern groups and more active trading. The upward trend remained strong on Wednesday, with the regular 6 bond rising sharply by 7 jiao, and the trend was quite firm. On Thursday, there were rumors, and the 96 bond fell by half a yuan, with northern groups gradually emerging. Friday was still very chaotic, but gains outweighed losses. On Saturday, northern groups were heavily unloading, and manipulators pushed the 96 bond up again, reaching around 13 yuan. The market price was generally good by 5 or 6 jiao. The overall situation for the week was stable with upward momentum. The 96 bond was completely manipulated by speculators. As a result, the market price increased by several jiao to 1.34 yuan. The total transaction volume was 13,002,400 yuan, with 160 shares of stock. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share).</p>
<p>New York Silver Stocks Firm</p>
<p>A report from Sin Feng Foreign Firm yesterday (the 10th) on the New York stock market stated that due to extremely bullish news, the market continued to rise, and trading was also active. The Pennsylvania Railroad has ordered 57 streamlined electric locomotives. National Drug Company issued a stock dividend of 100% plus a bonus of 1.5 yuan. There was an unfounded rumor that after the government nationalized silver, the silver revenue was less than expected, so it was planned to raise the silver price. Silver stocks were also firm. The main negative news in the market was that Granby Consolidated Mining, Smelting and Power Company issued a notice requesting shareholders to approve the permanent closure of the company's last mine. The bond market advanced under the leadership of U.S. government bonds. Small exchange stocks eased due to profit-taking. Chicago wheat rose due to increased public participation. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>American Cotton Buyers Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm due to good cloth market conditions and manufacturers buying forward contracts. Buyers were active, and the market was firm. Spot prices rose by 10 points per pound, and futures prices rose by 7 to 10 points per pound. British cotton futures rose by 7-8 points. Indian cotton rose due to market manipulators buying in. Nagpur rose by 7.5 annas, Oomra rose by 1.5 rupees, and Broach rose by 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 10th).</p>
<p>Conflicting Opinions on Increase or Decrease in U.S. Cotton Acreage</p>
<p>A New York telegram on November 9th reported on the cotton market situation for the week, stating that at the beginning of the week, operators were engaged in waiting for the election results and the Department of Agriculture's cotton production report, so all transactions at the beginning of the week were limited to this. The South sold slightly, and the bulls also closed out before the holiday. Under this pressure, prices were slightly weak, but later rebounded due to the stability of the Liverpool market, inflationary buying, the great victory of the government's new measures and policies, and the strength of the wheat and securities markets. The Department of Agriculture's cotton production report did not greatly affect the cotton market. At the end of the week, the market fluctuated. Currently, general attention is focused on the degree of cotton acreage under consideration in Washington. Opinions on whether to increase or decrease the acreage next year are divided, causing confusion. After the election, the buying momentum for textiles gradually weakened. There are now two situations: one is that the position of spot cotton is very tight, and the other is that merchants want to see a resurgence of consumer demand before making further purchases. The cotton market is hovering between these two situations.</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>River Rice Calm and Unchanged</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Over 30 sources from various groups (nearly 5,000 dan of goods in total). Sales in this street seem slightly more active than before, but the orders from other groups were completely suspended due to Sunday and today's customs closure, resulting in a stable market situation despite relatively strong sources. The prices of late rice from Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sijing, Fengxian, and Lianjiang, as well as thick new japonica rice from Sutong groups such as South Roll and Hirano white rice, continued to hold steady, without any increases or decreases. Medium-grade varieties such as Duyangjian also remained stable. Only high-grade varieties seemed slightly more in demand than normal, while there was no change in the price of Yin Yuan rice.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 15-16 sources from various groups at the river wharves. Sales of various goods in the market, new japonica rice, new Yangjian rice, broken japonica rice, thin rice, and early rice, were average. Old white rice was sluggish. New Dujian rice and new Chenbu Kejian rice were slightly lower. The market situation was that high-grade new japonica rice was tightly priced outside the corner, and the middle levels were firm. Broken japonica rice and new Dujian rice were stable. The price of new Yangjian rice increased by 1-2 jiao. Thin rice and early rice were still weak. New Chenbu Kejian rice showed a slight improvement. The price of old white rice decreased slightly by a jiao or so.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Slight Increase in Foreign Sugar Inventory</p>
<p>This week, foreign sugars such as raw sugar, white Dutch sugar, and brown sugar saw a weak decline due to slow sales. According to the investigation, the inventory of foreign sugar as of Saturday was slightly higher than the previous week's inventory, as noted below.</p>

<h3>From the Relief Work in the Newly Recovered Bandit Areas of Southern Jiangxi to the Public Clinic System (3)</h3>
<p>— Mr. Pang Jingzhou's Lecture, Notes by Chen Shengbai and Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>(C) Discussion on Using a Multi-Level System for Medical Talent</p>
<p>This time, my meeting with Mr. Lu Zhide caused a tremendous change in my thinking. Mr. Lu's background is in the aristocratic Xiehe Medical College, and he has lived in a beautiful environment. In our ideal, we would think that his thoughts and behaviors might be dominated by urban material civilization or take the city as his goal—this is the traditional concept of the Chinese. Most scholars who have returned from studying abroad feel that there is a lack of material enjoyment in China—but this Mr. Lu, although he is a brand-new figure, his views on medical issues discussed with me this time completely lack aristocratic lofty thoughts and can be said to be completely consistent with mine. Because my intention is precisely that we must leave the urban background and go deep into the people. We must never look at everything with an urban perspective. Laws vary according to local customs and human feelings, and medicine should be the same. In particular, Chinese medicine must be adapted to the times and conditions to be effective. Now, let me re-introduce Mr. Lu's theory of adopting a multi-level system for medical talent.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu said: "If we want to popularize scientific medicine and make it penetrate into the people, we should start with the construction of rural hospitals. As for how to make rural hospitals successful? Then we should take a broad view and consider it from the perspective of national economic strength. The distribution of medical talent in China should actively adopt a multi-level system, that is, talent from nursing backgrounds may also be used in rural areas to manage medical and disease treatment techniques." We think: Mr. Lu probably feels that there is not enough medical talent in China to distribute. That is why he said this. Like the nurses I brought from Shanghai this time, their skills are not only lacking in rural areas, but are also absolutely needed in small counties and towns in the interior.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, let me also talk about the old doctors. In rural areas, not only is there a lack of new doctors, but even old doctors are lacking. It is simply impossible to find old doctors in remote areas. When I arrived at Nanchang Station this time, out of curiosity, I went to investigate a Chinese medicine shop. I found that there were only about thirty kinds of decoction pieces and seven or eight kinds of pills and powders in the medicine shop. Look: How simple is the medicine in the Chinese interior. So, I think that to really talk about the national medical problem, the ink lawsuits between new and old medicine in Shanghai newspapers can be said to have simply not scratched the itch. However, what I want to state here is that the popularization of medicine must be based on scientific thought, scientific methods, and scientific knowledge to move forward. This must absolutely not be shaken. In particular, the popularization of scientific medicine in China does not necessarily have to take the city as the background and advocate material high-sounding arguments before it can be implemented.</p>
<p>(D) Motion for National Public Clinic</p>
<p>However, from the above statistics, we should recognize that its scope not only includes outpatient clinics, but also hospitalized patients. The departments treated also include (1) 42 major surgical operations, (2) military general surgery, (3) internal medicine and dermatology departments, (4) infectious diseases, (5) epidemics, etc. The regions and nature included also vary and are not limited to one corner, such as (1) bandit areas, (2) flood areas, (3) cities, (4) near commercial ports, with areas reaching Hangzhou, Shanghai, Jiangxi Province, Pudong, and other places. Among the drugs used, (1) expensive serums, such as dysentery serum, were used at 160 cc each time.</p>
<p>From the above discussion, we know that the medicine in Jiangxi, Henan, and other provinces is not yet up to par: Just imagine: It goes without saying that drought and famine have been continuous in Gansu and Shaanxi for years. In this view, if the entire Chinese medicine wants to find a way out, it must be done with the public medical system to be successful, and the germ of the public medical system must first start with the new medical clinics, without rushing to talk about large hospitals. However, the new medical clinics may as well be established first in wealthy provinces and counties. Now, let me take my personal experience in running public welfare hospitals in various places over the years and statistically compile some numbers to see how possible the public medical system is:</p>
<p>(1) According to the latest report from the Shanghai Local Association dispatched to Nanchang to take charge of relief work, a total of 16,427 patients were diagnosed in the past two months, and the number will generally increase. Statistics show that 41,100 patients will be diagnosed in five months. However, the funds of only 8,000 yuan are sufficient. The average cost per patient is about 2 jiao. However, I feel that it is very uneconomical. The reasons for this lack of economy are roughly as follows. The first is the travel expenses for the long journey. The second is the preparation of luggage. The third is the re-purchase of equipment. Fourth, often because of the urgency of application, the drug cannot use raw materials, but uses a more expensive pill. Fifth, for the short-term employment of doctors, the salary is of course higher. We see that the average cost per patient is 2 jiao, as mentioned above. Analyzing this number, the average salary of the doctor accounts for 1 jiao, 2 fen, and 5 li, and the actual drug cost for the patient is only 7 fen and 2 li.</p>
<p>(2) Let's take the average statistics of the nine public welfare medical affairs I have handled in the past two years, such as the floods in five counties in southern Sichuan, Guangchang, Jiqun Hospital, emergency epidemic hospital, Yangjing Hospital, Gaohang Hospital, Pudong Hospital, Hangzhou epidemic hospital, wounded soldier hospital, etc. The number of patients diagnosed was 225,432, and the amount of money spent was 90,709 yuan. The average cost per patient is 4 jiao and 2 li, which seems very expensive.</p>
<h3>Soliciting Information on Local Health and Medical Conditions</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, this publication will soon be two years old. It has always taken it as its responsibility to create and advocate new medicine and promote national health; however, the colleagues' talents and knowledge are limited, and their knowledge is not comprehensive, and they are always worried about falling short. We hereby respectfully invite people from all over the world to give us their support, hoping to promote more in the aspects of national medicine and health. Whether it is an official report or a private investigation, it is welcome. The materials must be accurate and the reports must be detailed: Once received, they will be published immediately, and a small reward will be given in return. This announcement is hereby made.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Editorial Department of Shen Bao Medical Weekly</p>
<h3>A Hope Regarding Military Doctors</h3>
<p>— Li Kangnian</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: Because of participating in the bandit suppression work in the bandit area for many years, the actual restrictions, and my old friend—Shen Bao—that I have to meet every day have been separated for a long time. Life has been more stable in the past few months, and I have moved to this relatively large city of Baoding to live in, and I have only recently resumed my old friendship with my old friend. Here at my old friend's place, I know that you are working hard for the public health cause, which I am very grateful for.</p>
<p>The short article below is the experience of a few years of on-the-ground observation that I consider very important, so I wrote it out and asked if you could give it a bit of your valuable space—this will be somewhat beneficial to the development of the military medicine cause, and tens of thousands of military medical personnel who are from unofficial medical schools are very grateful to you—for giving them a voice to express their grievances and hopes. I wish you all the best in your efforts!</p>
<p>In our Chinese cities, the medical and health cause has made considerable progress in the past ten years, but in the rural areas and the army, although the authorities have been constantly trying to develop it, due to the limitations of talent and economy, it is still far from the horizontal line.</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, there have been internal and external troubles in the country, which have been in a state of war at all times. As a result, the number of troops has also increased dramatically. The medical and health cause of the army has also been plagued by a shortage of talent. What I want to talk about in this article is a few words and a hope regarding military doctors.</p>
<p>"The logistics officer is rich, the secretary is poor, the adjutant butters up, and the cunning and dissolute is a military doctor." This is a popular and extremely real saying in the army; from this, we can imagine what military doctors look like in the army and how they are looked down upon.</p>
<p>Originally, medicine is the most profound science, and doctors have deep knowledge and noble personalities. How can they be called "cunning and dissolute"? This is why most of the military doctors are just filling in the numbers. Most of them are from unofficial medical schools. They only know a little bit of ordinary medical knowledge. The way they treat patients is laughably bad; therefore, the four words "cunning and dissolute" are extremely appropriate to put on the heads of military medical personnel. Even the military medical personnel themselves sometimes admit that they are "cunning and dissolute" in their conversations with colleagues.</p>
<p>Today, in all major countries in the world, with the advancement of science, the medical and health cause of the army is making rapid progress day by day. Only in China is it being manipulated by this group of "cunning and dissolute" people. This is really a serious problem.</p>
<p>The authorities have long been aware of this problem, so in addition to expanding military medical schools, there are also military medical school refresher courses. It is said that one class is recruited every two years, with 40 people in each class, with each division recommending two people to enter the school; this is the best way to remedy the military medical personnel who are just filling in the numbers, but there are already more than 100 divisions in China now. Among the military medical personnel in these 100-odd divisions, although there are no definite statistics, it is undoubtedly that most of them are just filling in the numbers. This kind of approach can be said to be a drop in the bucket, and the effectiveness is lacking—thinking about the future of the army's medical and health cause, I hope that the authorities can expand the refresher course, at least within three to five years, so that military medical personnel from unofficial medical schools who are just filling in the numbers have the opportunity to further their studies. Among these military medical personnel, there are a small number who are beyond redemption, they do not seek to improve themselves, and they think that this level of theirs is enough; but most of them want to seek further studies, they have rich experience, and they are constantly seeking to improve themselves, but they are suffering from having no way to enter, and the authorities can use their strengths to cultivate them.</p>
<p>This hope is ordinary, common, but very important.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Prostitution Today (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— "Que," sent from Nanjing</p>
<p>The proliferation of private prostitutes has a dramatic impact on society.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Here are three major points: (1) the spread of venereal diseases, which is difficult to prevent, because private prostitutes secretly engage in prostitution without paying attention to hygiene and prevention, and brothel keepers only seek profit, regardless of everything, resulting in the rampant spread of venereal diseases. The increasing number of people treated in the venereal disease departments of central hospitals and various clinics in the city is solid proof. (2) Trafficking in human beings. Since society has an urgent need for prostitutes, those who regard it as a source of profit will naturally appear in due course. As a result, tragedies that are extremely inhumane and violate human rights emerge endlessly. Women are like commodities, bought and sold repeatedly, completely losing their freedom. Even the licensed singers, most of whom are bought and sold, not to mention others. (3) Affecting public security. The proliferation of private prostitutes makes it easy for petty thieves and bandits to mix in, and various dark secrets caused by trafficking in human beings and other causes can directly or indirectly affect local public security.</p>
<p>Regarding the rescue plan, we do not want to repeatedly sing high-sounding slogans to society about raising women's rights and establishing large factories. According to the above situation, the following conclusions have been drawn. The only way to fundamentally save the situation is to have three major points: first, manage venereal diseases; second, strictly prohibit trafficking in human beings; and third, popularize education. If these three points can be achieved, then prostitution can be eliminated without being labeled as such. Only shouting the two words "ban prostitution" loudly without seeking fundamental solutions is like an idiot dreaming. Now, let me briefly explain the three methods: (A) Regarding the management of venereal diseases, one is to examine prostitutes, including clinical examination, microscopic examination, and serum examination, etc., which should be carried out one by one to ensure accuracy. However, in the actual implementation, if each prostitute is examined once every ten days, she is still at risk of infection for the remaining 27 days of the month. In other words, she may only maintain her current status for a moment during the examination. Therefore, its effect is minimal. Although scientific medicine is making progress day by day, it can never know whether a person has germs at a glance. For example, in a certain city, the examination of prostitutes is only based on pulse, eyes, and touching the palm of the hand to determine whether they are infected. This is really deceiving oneself and others. Since the examination procedures are so complicated and cumbersome, it is even more impossible to rely solely on them as a tool for managing venereal diseases. If it is not carried out in conjunction with the following methods, it is not enough to say that it is effective. (2) Prevention and treatment are the most effective and have simple procedures. It is only necessary to take appropriate preventive measures before and after sexual intercourse to avoid infection. (3) Early treatment. If unfortunately infected, seek diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible and do not delay, lest you lose the opportunity to treat. (4) Free treatment. This is extremely important, because after being infected with germs, if syphilis is treated with injections, 30 to 40 injections are required. At 5 yuan per injection, the amount is considerable. May I ask, will brothel keepers, whose sole purpose is to make money, be willing to pay this huge amount to treat people who are not important to them? (5) Contraception. This matter should also be promoted, in order to avoid children with hereditary syphilis, so as to affect national health. On the one hand, education must also be given to have sexual knowledge, in order to prevent problems before they occur. (B) Strictly prohibit trafficking in human beings and ban the old brothel keeper system. The harm of old brothel keepers is too numerous to mention. They are the main culprits in creating all kinds of evil and destroying women. They only know how to satisfy their private interests and do not care about the suffering of others. Even if prostitutes are sick, they will never be lenient and still force them to receive guests. If they do not comply, they will be whipped immediately. Brothel keepers regard prostitutes as cash cows and will never give up their interests. Therefore, the fire pit hell of prostitutes is directly created by brothel keepers, which is difficult to gloss over. To achieve the true purpose of banning prostitution in order to save women, it is necessary to strictly prohibit trafficking in human beings and ban the old brothel keeper system. According to our investigation, nine out of ten prostitutes come from trafficking. The reasons for trafficking include abduction and parents being forced to make a living, but those who consider their own interests or willingly degenerate are few. Refugees in disaster areas who have not been trained by old brothel keepers and become prostitutes in cities are rarely seen. Trafficking in human beings is not only a step for women to fall into the fire pit hell, but also creates various evil forces that affect local peace. Therefore, it must be strictly prohibited. If there are any gains, they should be severely punished to warn them. (C) Popularize education. Popularizing education is to improve production. This is a common problem in society and does not need to be described in detail here. In short, the problem of prostitutes is of great concern to society and cannot be solved by simply hanging up a sign banning prostitution. In addition, attention must also be paid to the marriage of prostitutes. I believe that it must go through the legal procedures stipulated by the official government to avoid second or third trafficking.</p>
<h3>From the Benevolence Hospital to the Inequality of Treatment Between Chinese and Foreigners in the Concessions</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The Benevolence Hospital is located on Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession and is a hospital with a charitable nature. Since I have been in charge of the hospital, I have been engaged in internal reorganization. However, what I still regret to this day is that the vegetable market at the entrance cannot be moved away.</p>
<p>The hospital takes cleanliness as a prerequisite, and the appearance is also very important. Now, however, the vegetable stalls are lined up at the entrance, causing traffic congestion and foul odors to be heard everywhere. Those who come to the hospital often feel unpleasant, and those who are hospitalized often hear noises. Therefore, we have made loud appeals to the concession authorities, such as the French Municipal Council and the Chinese Ratepayers Association—but the speakers are earnest, and the listeners are indifferent. The reasons are sufficient, but they cannot move their ears; the feelings are sincere, but they cannot touch their hearts. Do they have hearts of stone, which cannot be moved by words? This is nothing but the imbalance of treatment between Chinese and foreigners!</p>
<p>It is the same hospital, but the treatment given to Chinese and foreigners is different. For those established by foreigners, whether formal, informal, charitable, or commercial, anything that can enhance their appearance and increase their benefits, the concession authorities will do their best to plan for them. Have we seen the phenomenon of vegetable stalls at the entrance of foreign hospitals? Even placing a car in the wrong place will be interfered with by the police, let alone other matters. Now, for hospitals established by Chinese, they allow them to be cramped and messy without planning for them, and they listen to their appeals without paying attention. The great power of the concession is in the hands of foreigners, and their discrimination is not without reason. However, the so-called Chinese Ratepayers Association is a group of Chinese people in the concession, working for the happiness of the Chinese people. But they also turn a deaf ear, which is deeply incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Not only this, but everything shown in the concession is a phenomenon of unequal treatment. In the same concession area, the roads are constantly being repaired where foreigners live, and sanitary facilities are provided with utmost care. Where Chinese people live, the roads are rugged with loose stones, and the sight of dust and filth is an eyesore. I ask, is the tax paid by Chinese people less than that of foreigners? The obligations fulfilled are the same, but the rights enjoyed are as different as heaven and earth. Is there anything more unfair in the world than this?</p>
<p>What's more, the Municipal Council often generously donates and subsidizes foreign hospitals, regardless of whether they are charitable or formal hospitals, such as a certain foreign sanatorium in Shanghai. If it is established by Chinese, even if its nature is purely charitable, the Municipal Council rarely provides subsidies. Does charity also have a distinction between Chinese and foreigners? This is why the concession is a sub-colony.</p>
<p>Now, the Benevolence Hospital is unfortunately run by Chinese, and unfortunately located in a Chinese area. Therefore, the vegetable stalls at the entrance, which the concession authorities could order to be moved with a single official document, are withheld. It can be asserted that they regard the Chinese as uncivilized. I have previously published two articles on this matter in the newspapers, and this is the third appeal. Now, due to road repairs, the vegetable stalls at the entrance of the hospital have been temporarily moved elsewhere. This shows that relocation is not impossible. Whether the Municipal Council will take the opportunity to ban their return as a precautionary measure, I will wait and see.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge of Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(44) Hyperacidity</p>
<p>(Question) What are the causes of hyperacidity?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is a symptom of nerve disorder, and it can also be found independently. It is common among middle-aged people.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms?</p>
<p>(Answer) Usually, stomach pain occurs one hour after eating (especially when eating sour or extract-rich foods, or when eating rice flour and alcohol). It often lasts until the next meal. The pain radiates to the back and both shoulder blades. Eating food or drinking beverages will stop the pain.</p>
<p>(Question) Do people with hyperacidity have any changes in appetite?</p>
<p>(Answer) Appetite is normal, or even increased.</p>
<p>(Question) What discomfort is there in the stomach?</p>
<p>(Answer) There is acid reflux, heartburn, acidic belching accompanied by spasmodic constipation.</p>
<p>(Question) Are there any changes in the urine?</p>
<p>(Answer) The acidity of the urine decreases and often shows an alkaline reaction, with the presence of phosphoric acid components.</p>
<p>(Question) When there is too much acid in the stomach, how is the digestion of food?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is easy to digest meat, but difficult to digest carbohydrates.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the treatment for hyperacidity?</p>
<p>(Answer) To treat hyperacidity, both diet and medication must be considered.</p>
<p>(Question) Regarding diet, what should be done?</p>
<p>(Answer) The most important thing is to avoid foods that stimulate gastric acid secretion. All foods should be cooked and not baked.</p>
<p>(Question) Can protein-containing foods be ingested?</p>
<p>(Answer) Although too much protein can combine with free hydrochloric acid, it may increase secretion. Therefore, it is better to eat foods with less protein, such as milk, egg white, and boiled meat.</p>
<p>(Question) Can fat be ingested?</p>
<p>(Answer) Fat has an inhibitory effect on hyperacidity, so it is most suitable.</p>
<p>(Question) Can seasonings, tea, and coffee be consumed?</p>
<p>(Answer) Because they can all promote gastric secretion, they are not suitable.</p>
<p>(Question) What medications should be used?</p>
<p>(Answer) Alkaline agents and astringents should be used. Alkaline agents include sodium bicarbonate, calcined magnesia, and dried sodium sulfate. Astringents include bismuth preparations. In addition, some analgesics such as hyoscyamus extract and atropine can also be used.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(23) Diphtheria (commonly known as white throat)</p>
<p>Diphtheria is a disease name transliterated from the original name "Diphtherie". It is commonly known as white throat, throat wind, throat measles, pharyngeal throat wind, etc., which all refer to diphtheria. In fact, this kind of name seems not very appropriate. Because diphtheria does not only occur in the throat. It can also occur in the pharynx and nasal cavity. Moreover, from clinical experience, it seems that it occurs more often in the pharynx. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to use the words "white throat" or "throat wind" to represent diphtheria. Only the diphtheria that occurs in the pharynx can be called pharyngeal diphtheria, the diphtheria that occurs in the larynx can be called laryngeal diphtheria, and the diphtheria that occurs in the nasal cavity can be called nasal diphtheria. This is more accurate.</p>
<p>The causative bacteria of diphtheria was discovered by Loeffler in 1883 and is called Loeffler's bacillus. Because this bacillus can only cause diphtheria, it is called diphtheria bacillus. It often exists in the pseudomembrane of the affected area of diphtheria patients. It has strong resistance to dryness and is not easily killed. Diphtheria is easily prevalent in late autumn and early spring when the weather is dry. Perhaps it is because of its strong resistance to dryness. Although it exists in the pseudomembrane of the affected area, its toxins often invade the patient's whole body. Therefore, the systemic symptoms of the patient are more serious than the local symptoms. The most common routes of infection are the tonsils, followed by the nasal cavity and larynx. The conjunctiva of the eye, middle ear, mucous membrane of the vulva, small skin wounds, etc. can also be invaded, but this is rare. Also, this disease is often co-infected with streptococci, staphylococci, or other pathogens. At this time, the local symptoms are mostly severe.</p>
<p>The most susceptible age for this disease is children from two to seven years old. Children with hypertrophy of the palatine tonsils are more likely to develop it. Infections after the age of fourteen gradually decrease. Therefore, it is relatively rare for adults to contract this disease. Having had diphtheria once does not necessarily mean that you will be immune in the future, because its immunity is very short-lived. Sometimes, it even increases the tendency for the disease to recur.</p>
<p>The transmission of diphtheria is mostly by contact. Like (1) the patient's cough, (2) the patient's clothes, bedding, books, food, sputum, and children's toys, (3) the air at close range, etc. can all transmit the disease. In a family with many children, if there is a child suffering from this disease, it can often be transmitted to his siblings. Therefore, children in kindergartens and elementary schools have many opportunities to be infected if it spreads. The most dangerous fact is that in the initial onset, when the child has not yet felt ill, his mouth already contains the pathogens of the disease, or when the child has just recovered and still goes to school as usual, his mouth still contains the pathogens of the disease. With these two opportunities, its transmission is of course easier. Speaking of this, I want to advise the parents of the sick children that when the child recovers, he must obtain a certificate of permission from the doctor before he can be allowed to go to school. I want to hope for the school authorities that when diphtheria is prevalent, they must always pay attention to the oral hygiene of the children. If there are any suspicious children, they should immediately instruct the school doctor to conduct an examination or immediately send them home to the family to seek medical attention. This is the proper thing to do. Do not take it lightly. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (28)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Why do dull sounds occur in the lungs? There are several reasons for this. Now, let's only talk about those related to this disease, that is: when the alveoli are filled with solids or liquids, forming the so-called infiltration state in pathological anatomy, there will be dull sounds in the part where it is located. Of course, its infiltration area must be of considerable size to be effective. Examples of this, in addition to this disease, include pneumonia, lung abscess, and lung gangrene. The differentiation of these diseases from this disease cannot be done solely by percussion; it must be done through auscultation or other examinations before the truth can be revealed.</p>
<p>How does a tympanic sound occur in the lungs? Its formation is closely related to this disease. The first is the formation of cavities in the lung tissue: this cavity must be the size of a walnut to be proven by percussion sounds. The second is that the pleural cavity contains gas, which is called pneumothorax. Its cause is mostly due to the destruction of the lung wall by this disease, connecting the bronchus and the pleural cavity. In addition, there is one more thing that should be mentioned in connection, that is: artificial pneumothorax is now a very common treatment for this disease. If the doctor finds a tympanic sound during percussion, he must also pay attention to whether it is formed by the implementation of artificial pneumothorax treatment. The solution to this problem is of course not difficult, but it should not be ignored.</p>
<p>C. Auscultation. What is called auscultation? It is when the doctor places his ear directly against the patient's body wall, or uses an instrument (stethoscope) between the body and the ear, to examine the internal phenomena of the body. The latter method is more accurate because the ear can only hear most of the sounds, and it is easy to ignore small local areas. Also, in many places on the chest wall, it is impossible to press the ear tightly. The application of this examination procedure is almost limited to the chest (heart and lungs). When performing this procedure on the lungs, the patient should take deep breaths at the same time. The alveolar breath sound heard in this aspect is called the alveolar sound, which is what usually occurs in healthy lungs. If the lungs have pathological changes, the breath sounds will also have various abnormalities, and even other adventitious sounds will occur. The detailed situation in this regard is of course not something that can be exhausted in this article; now, let's write down a few kinds that are related to this disease.</p>
<p>Alveolar sounds sometimes become weak. There are many reasons for this, such as the occlusion of the trachea and branches due to secretions is the most likely to occur: that is, the lung tissue has an infiltration state, or cavities occur, will be like this. Sometimes the breath sounds are relatively rough, the so-called impure breath sounds. This state sometimes happens to occur in the early stage of pulmonary tuberculosis. If the lung tissue is infiltrated, or even contracted, another bronchial sound will occur in the place where alveolar sounds are usually heard. This disease and pneumonia are the most obvious examples. However, most of the infiltrated parts of pneumonia are in the middle and lower lobes, while tuberculosis is mostly in the upper lobes, which should be noted. Breath sounds with a mineral sound or mineral aftersound are called amphoric breath sounds. It is very similar to the adventitious sound of blowing air into a pot. It is easiest to find when a large cavity occurs in the lungs.</p>
<p>If there is liquid or viscous substance (such as mucus, pus, blood, swelling fluid) accumulated in the airways or alveoli of the lungs, its diameter is of course relatively small; breathing at this time will produce other adventitious sounds, this is the "pool sound"! It can be roughly divided into dry and wet types. The occurrence of wet sounds requires mobile secretions, the more mobile the sound, the more wet it is. Dry sounds are related to viscous liquids. Belonging to the dry aspect, there are snoring-like sounds, flute sounds, and crackling sounds, etc., different sounds. This is because the mucus in the trachea and branches is tense, and the air passing through it during breathing vibrates. Belonging to the wet aspect, there are large bubble sounds, medium bubble sounds, and small bubble sounds, which are distinguished according to the size and intensity of the sound. Large bubble sounds are seen in large tracheal branches and cavities, and small bubble sounds are seen in small tracheal branches and the smallest tracheal branches. In addition, there is also a distinction between resonant and non-resonant bubble sounds, which is based on its sound. I think readers must be dizzy with the distinction between these various breath sound abnormalities and adventitious sounds: That's right, even doctors feel very distressed when learning it. As for the truth of each kind, it is not something that can be described in words, it completely depends on the doctor's experience and his sharp hearing to solve it.</p>
<h3>Common Treatment for Fever (7)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Antipyretic Method: As mentioned in the previous article, if the fever is not too high, it is not necessary to think about reducing the fever. What you should pay attention to is increasing the patient's resistance. The previous article also mentioned that the method of increasing resistance is: (1) Let the patient rest quietly, (2) Provide him with all the nutrients needed by his body. The "not too high" heat we mentioned refers to short-term fever, with the temperature below 105 degrees Fahrenheit, and long-term fever, with the temperature below 103 degrees Fahrenheit. In other words, as long as the patient rests in peace and increases his resistance, the temperature at these limits will not cause much harm to him. But if the temperature is higher than these limits, it will harm the body's cells. In recent years, after carefully comparing the advantages and disadvantages of various antipyretic methods, it is known that hydrotherapy is the best method for reducing fever.</p>
<p>Hydrotherapy Antipyretic Method: For patients with high and not very high temperatures, bathing twice a day is of great benefit to the body. If the disease is mild, you can take a bath; if the disease is severe, others can wash it on the bed. Bathing can make the skin clean and excretion smooth, and it can also help blood circulation better. We know that people like to take baths when the weather is hot, and many people take baths several times a day, because they feel refreshed inside and out after bathing. It should be known that febrile patients are living a hot life at all times, often sweating a lot, and the skin excretes a lot of waste. If the excrement on the skin is washed away one or two or two or three times a day, he will naturally feel refreshed, and the skin can also do more excretion work, which can also indirectly help the disease recover quickly. If the patient is mentally restless or unable to sleep due to fever, he can be wrapped in a wet sheet. Note that when wrapping the patient with a wet skin sheet, his skin is always red, and he does not feel cold. This is beneficial to him. Suppose you see that the patient's skin is pale white, and he always feels cold, you should not use this method, because wrapping with a wet sheet is harmful to him. We use hydrotherapy to reduce fever not only to reduce his fever, but also to help the patient's blood flow better and strengthen breathing.</p>
<p>Brief Description of Various Hydrotherapy Antipyretic Methods: Those who have studied physics and chemistry slightly know that water is a good medium for storing heat and releasing heat. That is to say, water can store a lot of heat and also release a lot of heat. For example, the coastal area is very different from the climate in the center of the mainland on the same latitude. The coastal area is not too hot in summer and not too cold in winter, but the center of the mainland is not the case. It is hot in summer and cold in winter. The reason is that the center of the mainland lacks water to regulate the cold and heat of the climate. Then, it is of course very reasonable for us to use water to regulate the temperature of the body. Moreover, water is everywhere, and you don’t have to pay too much. Even though it is such an ordinary raw material, we should not think that it is not valuable if it does not cost a lot. We should use this commonly available raw material to create happiness for suffering patients with medical methods.</p>
<p>Before implementing hydrotherapy, we must know the condition of the patient's skin, whether the blood flow is good, whether the excretory function of the two kidneys is sound, and whether the nerves are stable. If the skin of a patient with a high fever is dry and hot, use warm water (the water temperature is about 85 degrees Fahrenheit or 30 degrees Celsius) to wash his body, on the one hand, it will make him feel very refreshed, and on the other hand, it can also reduce the fever. If the skin of a patient with a high temperature is cold, the first step is to wash the body with hot water (temperature 105 degrees Fahrenheit about 40 degrees Celsius), first let more blood flow to the skin. In addition to hot water, you can also add rubbing. If the skin becomes hot, you can use warm water to wash it. If it does not become hot, you can also wrap your body with mustard powder and a wet sheet (details later) or give him hot coffee and tea, blood vessel stimulants. It is also possible to give a small amount of alcohol to those who have a habit of drinking alcohol. If the skin is cool, even if the heat is high, you should not use cold on his skin to reduce the heat.</p>
<p>One more thing to note is that for patients with critical illness, you should also be careful not to be too aggressive when using these harmless antipyretic methods, because when the illness is serious, a person's life is like a candle in the wind, and it will be extinguished if you are not careful. Therefore, on the one hand, pay attention to his temperature, and on the other hand, pay attention not to disturb him too much. If you don’t understand this point, using this antipyretic method will also be harmful. Febrile patients with impaired kidney excretion should not use cold water to reduce their fever, but should use warm water. For example, it is also possible to let him lie in a warm water (85 degrees) bathtub for half an hour to two hours. If a febrile patient is delirious and has no energy, washing his body with cold water or adding rubbing can make him invigorated, and his breathing will immediately become stronger and more forceful, and his diet and digestion will improve. If you don't perform this operation on him, he will of course continue to be delirious. Suppose a febrile patient suffers from insomnia and is anxious, wrapping them in a wet sheet and wrapping them with dry felt can stabilize their mind and make it easier to sleep. The following are several common hydrotherapy methods for patients to use:</p>

<h3>Flattery</h3>
<p>— Pi</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A thousand wears, ten thousand wears, but flattery never wears through." This is originally an experienced saying that has been tested repeatedly. Although the word "flattery" is not found in the classics, its wonderful application and wide promotion can be said to be "reaching the heavens and the underworld."</p>
<p>Therefore, I also want to study the methods of "flattering," not only as a kind of "art of dealing with the world," but also as a way to get promoted and make a fortune. So I spent a lot of effort to collect various methods of "flattering" in history and studied them like "hanging my head from the beam and piercing my thigh," but after all, the times are different and the methods are too old, and most of them are not applicable. A former old gentleman in my private school often scolded me, "Your child's temper is too bad, and you are not worthy of being made." Perhaps it is because my temper is too bad, so I can't use this method.</p>
<p>What is the Western "flattery technique"? Because I haven't read the right-to-left text of "ABC," I haven't studied this information. It is said that Westerners do not like "flattery," but only advocate "bragging." Their methods of "bragging" are many and wonderful. I am simply like "Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden for the first time," I am really at a loss. It is said that the boss of a certain pharmacy in Shanghai in the past deeply understood the secret, so his career was very great. For example, the Americans invented the "death ray" a few days ago and said it was earth-shattering. Soon the Germans also invented the "death ray" and said it was earth-shattering and very powerful. Now the French have also invented the "death ray" and are also bragging and complacent. We Chinese do not advocate "bragging," but only like "flattery." Is it because the national character is different, so the "bragging and flattery" are different? However, I saw Mr. "Yongbo" 's article "Talking about Exaggeration" before, so the customs of foreigners, or perhaps they have been learned by clever Chinese?</p>
<p>Some say that flattery is not necessarily effective. Isn't there a saying, "Patting a horse on the hoof" not only doesn't do any good, but also suffers a lot. For example, "In the Qing Dynasty, there was a certain low-ranking official who liked 'flattery' but was not learned. One day, he met a certain superior in a bookstore. The superior brought his two sons. The low-ranking official wanted to offer words of compliment, but he couldn't get them. He only heard that those who praised the beauty of other people's sons often said that they were the sons of plowing cattle, so he said to the superior, "The two young masters are really worthy of being the sons of plowing cattle." The superior was furious and said, "Are you treating me like a plowing cattle?" The low-ranking official was greatly frightened and knew that the situation was not right and the analogy was wrong. So he quickly changed his words and said, "You are not cattle, I am cattle." The superior was even more angry, slapped him hard on the cheek, and said, "Are these two your sons?" The low-ranking official still fled with his head in his hands." Therefore, those who want to "flatter" but are not good at it often get the opposite result, but this is ultimately an exception.</p>
<p>It is said that the benefits of "flattery" are more promising and progressive than "bragging." Anyone who flatters an important person or a rich person will not only directly receive the other party's reward, but it is really unlimited. And those who flatter their horses also come like water flowing downwards, like those who flatter no more than one horse, and those who flatter his horse, or even countless. Therefore, the benefits of flattery are better than any business, and it is really unexpectedly effective, so Chinese people do not like "bragging" but only like "flattery." Is the reason perhaps here?</p>
<p>Moreover, "bragging" requires some capital, while "flattery" does not require capital, because bragging must have cattle to brag about, so capital is indispensable, while flattery is only flattering other people's horses, so there is no need for capital. For example, a certain country is bragging about inventing the "death ray." No matter how the cattle are bragging, there must always be a thing called "death ray," which is the so-called capital, while flattery is applied according to the person. As long as there is a flattery method, and the wonderful application depends on the heart, so Chinese people "flatter" more and "brag" less, how can we not know that it is a kind of lesson of the doctrine of practical experience?</p>
<h3>The Weariness of Autumn Woods</h3>
<p>— Ding Weinan</p>
<p>The trees are withered, the leaves have fallen bare, leaving only the stark naked branches reaching up to the azure sky as if imploring God's care. The wind was originally violent, but on the trees stripped of their leaves, the frenzy of the wind is invisible. Only in the withered grass on the horizon can one find its fierce actions, scurrying away desperately. Although the wind relentlessly and violently oppressed these defenseless trees, stripping them of their leaves, these dense thickets of small trees, barely taller than a person, can still endure the tempering force of the wind, retaining their inherent leaves and their original green color. Although the violent wind mocks them, it is truly unlike those old and shameless, large and powerless towering trees, the so-called "timber for beams and pillars," which lose all their former majesty in this season! In the season of "ten thousand purples and reds" so praised by poets, they once exploited their smaller kin, depriving them of the source of life that nature bestows—suppressing their vigor and causing them to wither! The power of the wind, the intoxicating brew of the wind, it drinks it madly, it is drunk, its face is flushed, it is weary, it falls down rustling, it lacks the support of strength, it is as if it has died once!</p>
<p>The birds, too, are sensibly less talkative, with only those tactless doves there, complaining "It's hard, oh, oh," but no one will sympathize with them, even if their fate is the same. Let them complain as they may, here and there; the wind is still the same, no, even more intensely rustling, sweeping madly and ruthlessly, sweeping over the withered and aged tree heads, sweeping over the dry and shriveled withered grass, sweeping over the lonely graves trampled by livestock!</p>
<p>The setting sun shines on these wearied autumn woods, and a few wisps of smoke from cooking fires curl from the rooftops in ever-changing, distorted shapes. A blurred and distant bell tower presents a vaguely discernible bell shape in the hazy and vast twilight. This place has lost the clamor of the city, this place presents a model of the hometown I left years ago! Ah! Hometown, your whole body is covered with wounds, your shattered heart has been trampled into powder by the violent oppressors; your peaceful and tranquil soul is trembling anxiously, shaken by terrible turmoil! The simple and honest farmers will henceforth go hungry, lamenting in those famines! Ah! God, when will you grant my hometown peace!</p>
<p>Life is truly duckweed, I feel the pain of my hometown's ruin, and I also grieve for my rootless wandering! The clouds are so free, yet how is it that my soul, not bound by any rope, is as if imprisoned? Everything in this forest is more stable than I am, truly unlike me, drifting like duckweed on the water!</p>
<p>Small birds sometimes chirp a few times, as if in hidden pain, not as happy as they could be. Truly, weariness is what life entrusts to this season! The wind continues to sweep, bearing its mission, it wants to confuse! No, to devastate these forests of trees with leaves in nature. Anyway, it is almost swept away, and among the abandoned ones in this entire natural world, if there are any, they are only those who are drunk and about to fall asleep, only the slender, thin shadows of the skeletons, swaying sadly in the setting sun, emitting their sorrowful pleas, gentle laments. Who will give them sympathy? Who will give them pity? Is it not so? Just like us humans, when you are out of luck, how do those who "flatter the powerful and influential" and "add flowers to the brocade" behave?</p>
<p>— Huang Jia's first work</p>
<p>Mr. A○ said: "It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep have been lost!"</p>
<h3>Cricket Fighting</h3>
<p>— Youqin</p>
<p>"Chi chi chi!" This large building was originally a family's ancestral hall. Since it was converted into a teahouse that year, every year when late autumn turns to winter, the "chi chi" sounds have filled the teahouse. Many people skilled in cricket fighting carry strings of cricket pots in cloth bags and flock there.</p>
<p>Old Jin Tang always brings a few crickets to the arena every year, and often wins a few dollars. Although he is poor this year, there is always hope. He stole his wife's clothes and pawned them for capital.</p>
<p>"Get out of the way, those with crickets come to register!" A Sha Sangzi is shouting in the corner, calling people to register for the matches.</p>
<p>"Um!" Old Jin Tang sends over his "Yellow Dragon," which has been weighed by the weigher, with the number and weight marked by the weigher still on the pot lid, and goes to register with Mr. Zhou, who has a figure-eight mustache, in the corner. At the same time, he pays attention to whether there is anyone on the register who can compete with him.</p>
<p>"Um, number 473 is similar to my 'Yellow Dragon'..." Old Jin Tang finds this one, secretly peeks at that number's cricket, and also stealthily inquires about the other person's cricket. Finally, through the introduction of his old acquaintance Ximing, he agrees with the owner of number 473 to play four branches of flowers. Yes, four branches of flowers is two dollars.</p>
<p>The fighting arena is surrounded by people, but there is no sound. Old Jin Tang is outside, his heart pounding.</p>
<p>"Chi chi chi," he knows that others are fighting in the crowd.</p>
<p>"Chi chi chi!" This time, he is sure that the victory or defeat has been decided. Yes, the spectators are shouting, "'White Flag' has won." So Old Jin Tang's heart itches, imagining his "Yellow Dragon" defeating number 473, standing tall, lifting its head, wings vibrating with the sound of victory, and the onlookers shouting, "'Yellow Dragon' has won!"</p>
<p>"Number 560 and 473, come to the stage!" The shout on the stage immediately moves Old Jin Tang, and he hurriedly squeezes into the crowd, sends the "Yellow Dragon" up, and watches the two handlers sitting opposite each other first pass his and his opponent's crickets into the separated fighting arena with paper tubes, then each excite their crickets, open the partition, and fight!</p>
<p>The crickets are roaring, jumping, kicking, and pressing on the Old Jin Tang's heart under the pile of people, which is "peeling peeling" beating non-stop.</p>
<p>One minute, two minutes... It's been a long time, it's really met an opponent, everyone is anxious, and the owner of number 473 is also uneasy on the side.</p>
<p>"Ah!" Suddenly, the "Yellow Dragon" retreats, and Old Jin Tang is startled, touching the money in his pocket. Fortunately, the "Yellow Dragon" shakes itself up and continues to fight, relieving him.</p>
<p>The spectators are holding their breath, and some are even worried for their owners.</p>
<p>Oh, no, the "Yellow Dragon" is a little weak, and Old Jin Tang's heart is about to jump out of his mouth, his eyes are blurred, and his head is a little dizzy; the owner of number 473 has a smile on the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>"Chi chi, chi chi chi!" Old Jin Tang is shaking with fear, the sound seems a bit unlike his own cricket's voice. Great, "Green Yuan has won!" Louder than thunder, shattering Old Jin Tang's heart.</p>
<h3>East, West, South, North</h3>
<p>— Sanduo</p>
<p>It's so hard to make a living these days. Those who want to be movie stars don't hesitate to introduce themselves with rape cases, while those who have become movie stars start living a life of cuddling.</p>
<p>Indeed, people complain about whatever they do. That's how people are, from birth to death.</p>
<p>But even though people complain, their methods must be unique to survive.</p>
<p>From selling thighs to jumping onto the screen, the first big advertisement is "breach of contract," which is similar to "regret for a misstep," but isn't the "reward of one thousand yuan" even more excessive?</p>
<p>However, this grand magic trick has unfortunately been exposed. The court authorities attach great importance to this trick. It is not known whether the magician can use his ability to steal the sky and change the sun. If he accidentally messes it up, that would be injustice! I'll say it again, it's so hard to make a living these days! (2 pm on the 9th)</p>
<h3>Eating at a Small Restaurant</h3>
<p>— Youqi</p>
<p>Originally, for people like us who eat fixed meals, restaurants are rare places for us to visit. Mentioning eating at a restaurant seems like an unusual thing.</p>
<p>Almost everyone can understand the situation of fixed meals. You have to listen to other people's commands. They give you this to eat, and you have to eat it, you can't resist. It's as if the meal is a reward. Otherwise, you might be given a cold shoulder. If it's more serious, you might even get into a fight.</p>
<p>However, if you eat at a restaurant, you can listen to your own "convenience." If you want this, they don't dare to give you that. If you want the taste to be heavier, they don't dare to make it lighter. You only show your own power and don't see their sullen faces.</p>
<p>The reason for this lies in the "money." One person's money comes from a monthly lump sum, while the other's comes from random small purchases. There won't be any "small tips" for lump sums, because since it's called a fixed meal, the incidental tips are also considered to be "included." Even if there are any, you don't have to ask, they're extremely limited, unlike those who eat individually who are so generous. After wiping their mouths, the rustling things roll into the bamboo tube or the money box with the words "Ten Thousand Taels of Gold" pasted on it.</p>
<p>However, that refers to large restaurants. If it's a small restaurant, although you might not see that kind of glory and scene, it's still better than eating fixed meals.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I've been wanting to eat at a restaurant these past two days. Although the fixed meals I'm getting are not bad, this unstable heart is always flying towards the restaurant.</p>
<p>I invited Old Li and Little Zhu, and one evening, taking advantage of the cold wind, we walked over very casually.</p>
<p>On the road, I hesitated a bit. I thought, which restaurant should we go to? Northern flavors are most suitable for me. So, Tongxinglou? Dayalou? But these places are too grand, so the three of us went to a small Tianjin restaurant. The place was very narrow, divided into two rooms, inside and out. That's probably a characteristic of Tianjin restaurants. In the outer room, there were large stoves, messy tables, and utensils piled up on both sides. In the inner room, there were a few red-lacquered, faded octagonal tables, with grease accumulated around the table seams. The level of messiness was no better than the outer room.</p>
<p>Casually, we ordered two dishes. Here, liquor is also necessary. We drank and ate slowly. Although we didn't have the poetic sentiment of poets, we had an extraordinary sense of heroism.</p>
<p>After we finished, our faces were a little red. The waiter brought us towels as usual. If I were to compare them, these towels were like the gray soft freedom produced by the Three Friends Society.</p>
<p>In a small northern restaurant, there is still one thing worth noting, and that is that after you hand your small tip to the waiter, they will answer with a loud shout, like the震動 of spring雷.</p>
<p>Walking out, it felt like something in my heart had been released. Truly, although the fixed meals I'm getting are not bad, the taste of this restaurant is still better.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Season</h3>
<p>— Qiaosheng</p>
<p>That day, I went alone to a teahouse on North Sichuan Road. This was a place I was very familiar with, a place I had to go to almost every day. I ran upstairs, and everything was the same. As usual, I chose the seat by the window, put down the magazine I was carrying under my arm. Qiu Ji would know without asking that I wanted a pot of Longjing tea, and he quickly brought it up with a towel. I sat down, breathed a sigh of relief, and wiped my hands with the towel. Then, I poured a cup of tea and drank a sip.</p>
<p>The weather was already late autumn.</p>
<p>So, a cup of hot tea could increase the body's temperature.</p>
<p>Because it was around 3 pm, and it wasn't a holiday, there were only a few people in the teahouse. I sat quietly there, opened the magazine, and wanted to finish reading an article about Andersen.</p>
<p>The young waiter, perhaps because he wasn't used to the quiet, stood next to me at some point.</p>
<p>However, he didn't speak.</p>
<p>I read my magazine.</p>
<p>About ten minutes passed!</p>
<p>"Mr. ×, the chrysanthemums have bloomed."</p>
<p>He suddenly said this to me.</p>
<p>I was annoyed by this young waiter's disturbance and wanted to ignore him, but he pointed to a pot of chrysanthemums placed next to the window, making me unable to help but glance at it.</p>
<p>Oh, what beautiful flowers!</p>
<p>Yellow chrysanthemums can take me back to my memories. — Autumn two years ago, maybe November, our university held a chrysanthemum festival: this was something that happened every year as usual.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, I went to find her.</p>
<p>"Let's go see the chrysanthemums!"</p>
<p>I pulled her out of the dormitory and ran straight to the chrysanthemum bushes. The chrysanthemums had various colors and different postures, and we weren't satisfied even after looking at them for a long time.</p>
<p>"I like the red ones."</p>
<p>"I like the white ones."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because they're clean."</p>
<p>Yes, she loved clean things so much!</p>
<p>So, I placed her in front of the white chrysanthemums and took a photo of this young female classmate — later I enlarged it to twenty-four inches. …</p>
<p>But two years have passed. …</p>
<p>That day, when I came back from North Sichuan Road, I made a special effort to take out that photo and look at it for a while. The photo had faded; the impression of that female classmate was also gradually becoming blurred in my mind.</p>
<p>I thought, in another two years, I'm afraid I'll completely forget her, right?</p>
<p>And now, it's chrysanthemum season again.</p>

<h3>Liu Desheng in Jiangxi (4)</h3>
<p>— Wanguo An</p>
<p>This one shouted, that one said, it simply confused the big black guy. He couldn't understand a single word, only hearing the sound of "ge li," "ge li." If the big black guy saw such a little girl in a place where there was no one, he would have many ways to deal with her. But here he was, in front of these people, encountering these grinning little girls, and at the same time unable to understand what they were saying. He really didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>The big black guy's face turned purplish-red, and he could only mutter dryly, unable to say a word. The little girls shouted more and more happily, their almost half-sized bound feet about to step on the big black guy's feet.</p>
<p>"White Army comrade: I'm really happy that you're here to join the Red Army. We must work hard!"</p>
<p>In the chaos, the big black guy heard the Jiangxi dialect phrase "work hard!" He became even more embarrassed, Little girls shouting about wanting to "do it" in broad daylight! This was truly a strange place.</p>
<p>"Red Army members should shake hands when they meet!"</p>
<p>"Let me be the first to shake hands."</p>
<p>The big black guy's large palm quickly grabbed the soft and tender little hand. His heart was pounding, and he thought that in another moment, they would take off his pants. Seeing that the situation was not good, this black fellow suddenly lifted his legs, as sturdy as flagpoles, and was about to charge out!</p>
<p>"Countryman: Don't run! This is the women's comfort team welcoming you!"</p>
<p>The three skinny guys forcibly held the big black guy back.</p>
