<h3>美國建艦之新提案　舒·</h3>
<p>｜太平洋上之狂潮｜</p>
<p>美國感於太平洋上之不安。感於遠東未來新市塲之受人威脅。感於菲利濱與關島之不易防守。是以乃有建造新艦以補足華盛頓條約所允許數量之計劃。以維持五五三之海軍比率。蓋以實際情形論。美國除主力艦。略勝於其太平洋上假想敵之外。其餘重輕巡艦。如潛水艦等。數量艦齡速率與續航力。表面雖與英國同等。實質則劣於日本。一旦世界有事美國海軍兵力。須顧及大西洋與太平洋之防務。勢力一分。戰鬭力自更削弱。卽使中立。尙難維持商務上之運輸。不能必保其公海上之航行自由。矧今後之世界戰爭。美國决不能免去牽入漩渦之危險耶。</p>
<p>同時遠東局勢。無時無刻不在激劇變動之中。僞國之爲日本製成也。日蘇關係之日趨緊張也。亞東門羅主義之進展也。與夫其他一切國際上之變遷。皆足使美國陷於困窘之中。其對日外交之棘手。以過去華盛頓會議情勢論。當時美國主張停止海軍軍備競爭最力。而日本則力爭其所謂八八艦隊之計劃。此種計劃如果成功。日本海軍實力。縱未必卽超越乎英美之上。而太平洋之勢力。已不能不讓日本獨步矣。美國當時爲緩和緊張之局面起見竟不惜犧牲菲利濱與關島建築要塞工程。以交換五五三之比率。更議定九國公約以保持遠東之和平。詎知此事守勢外交。結局祇見九國公約之被破壞。海軍比率亦等具文。美國海軍旣居下位。遠東霸權。遂不能不爲日本所操持矣。　　再則經濟恐慌之狂潮一再襲來。工業農業向極發展之北美合衆國。亦無法避免。更不能開闢新市塲。以作消售過剩商品之處所。經過將近一年之種種實際奮鬭。所得亦甚細微。工業生産之數字。未見振興農業且愈退化。所謂藍鷹革命運動。所謂金圓低價等等經濟上之非常手段。皆於事實無多大補益。而日本以産業後進國家。極力爲軍事上冒險行動。其産業界受其剌激。軍需工業遂突飛猛進。日本國内之經濟市面。賴以支持。此種非常方法。是否卽將引起非常之禍患。其人民因過度剌激。是否將由疲敝而至於頺廢。在此緊急關頭。彼皆不暇細問祗須興奮此一時期。然後徐圖補救。美國有見於此。故亦借建造大量軍艦。以爲當前産業界衰落之興奮劑。以今年以前所定之建造艦艇計劃尙不足以補濟目前之窮。而於是海軍建艦新提案出現矣。</p>
<p>據美海軍當局所擬議提案之輪廓。在倫敦條約限度内。約爲軍艦一百○二艘。其中包含驅逐艦六十五艘。八吋砲巡艦一艘。六吋砲巡艦五艘。航空母艦（一萬五千噸以上）一艘。潛水艦三十艘自明年度起以至一九三九年。總計支出建造經費。共五億一千六百萬美金。今後五年之中。毎年平均約建造大小艦艇二十艘在明年一年中將建造驅逐艦十二艘。八吋砲巡洋艦一艘。六吋砲巡洋艦二艘。潛水艦六艘。嚮導驅逐艦二艘。此種巨大建艦之提案。其激動太平洋上之波浪。將何如哉。</p>
<p>夫建立巨大海軍力。至少須有兩種主要條件。第一須有巨量之經濟實力第二須當事國國民有海事思想。受海外事業之剌激。欲求海外之發逹。然後乃可得而建立强大之海軍。今日之美國。固已具備此兩種條件焉。日本則僅有第二條件。經濟力則異常脆弱。建艦競爭展開之後。吾固知日本之必將無以爲繼也。</p>

<h3>蘇聯應付世界大戰的凖備（海參崴通信）</h3>
<p>蘇俄窺破日本的企圖</p>
<p>赤軍十五萬集中遠東</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰的主角是德意志、地點是在歐洲、作戰的主要國家是德·英·法·俄·諸國、引起戰爭的重大原因、到現在大家都會承認是經濟關係、是英德兩國爭奪經濟的覇權而起、</p>
<p>現時、經過了第一次大戰、歐洲諸國、僅只表面上恢復了戰前的市面繁榮、其實各自都有牠的弱點、例如英國擁有三百萬的失業工人、德國竟有五百萬、就這一點、也足令當事諸國不敢輕於挑戰、因爲怕惹起國内的禍亂、竟至於不可收拾、法國在表面上好像比歐洲大陸諸國都好些、其實也不過比較上略好而已、内部的困難、並不是可以樂觀的、</p>
<p>在歐洲祗有一個獨特與衆不同的國家、就是蘇聯、牠在實行第一五年計劃的時期、誠然還有許缺點、這些缺點在表面上看、如果從西比利亞大鐵道旅行而穿過莫斯科以至於歐洲、旅行者設使又是一個資本主義制度底下住慣了的人、就會感到許多的不舒適、也會看出蘇聯有許多不健實的地方、特别是蘇聯人民的日常生活用品、總覺着還不十分充足、鄉村農民的衣物、尤其缺乏、食用方面、如　食之類、更不用講了、</p>
<p>但這正是牠｜蘇聯的優點、｜牠的人民上下一致、節衣縮食、以從事於他們所理想的建設、他們自已剝削自已來建立生産手段的建設、不過這件事情在遠東方面、如沿海省·如阿木耳省等等地方都不甚看得出來、一則是這些地方、地廣人稀、天氣寒冷、二則是有被人威脅之虞、所以還没有什麽顯著的進步、</p>
<p>這個威脅的人是誰、想來住在祖國内的同胞、可以想像得到的、那就是第二次世界大戰的主人翁、日本帝國主義者、牠兩年以來、天天凖備和人家武力爭鬭、在世界一般的看法、以爲今後的國際鬭爭是太平洋上的鬭爭、是日美兩國爲主的鬭爭、或者是日英兩國因爭奪中國市塲而起的角逐、可是我們住在另一環境裏的人看起來、這類的鬭爭、雖然也是日趨於激烈、雖然也是各不相讓、可是牠們三國的本據無論政治的根據地、軍事的根據地、都相隔得太遠、而且海上戰爭、這様遠的距離也不是容易起來的、卽飛機行程很快、但續航力并不大、所以事實上還有比英美對日戰爭的可能性更大的、</p>
<p>這就是蘇日戰爭了、假定蘇聯這兩年來不力持和平主義、不一切採取靜觀的態度、老早就已惹起了正面衝突、因爲日本的大陸政策、不僅是要併呑南滿、要把北滿收入掌握之中、并且打算進窺西比利亞、把西北利亞的富源收爲已有、特别是要以庫頁北島的石油　來救濟日本的油慌、</p>
<p>日本這種心思、已經一天一天的顯露出來、其所以不敢發動的原因、第一·是資本主義各國内在的矛盾不能調和、不承認日本爲進攻蘇聯的先鋒、第二·是日本自已在財政上毫無把握、軍事時期延長以後、牠無法保持必勝、兩年來對中國的爭鬥、表面上勝利、實際上困難就是明證、然而日本依然着着進逼、於刦持中東路之外、還在哈爾濱等地暗地指引白俄爲反赤的組織、</p>
<p>因此、蘇聯纔有公然的表示、如果日本敢於侵犯西比利亞、蘇聯的赤軍、將决然起而自衛、從人民委員長莫洛托夫和外長李維洛夫的演講、都可以作證、他們的說話、并不是說過就算了事、我們看白魯赫爾（卽加倫）將軍的回任遠東軍司令官、駐在伯力指揮、現在由海參崴至貝加爾一帶十五萬的鐵血赤軍、卽不難窺見蘇聯的用意、再則一九三四年一月一日起、駐在遠東方面的赤軍兵士和下級官、都增加薪餉百分之五十、中上級增加薪餉百分之二十、同時更獎勵西比利亞移民、這正是針對日帝國主義大陸政策競爭啊、（一九三三年十二月三十日）</p>

<h3>張學良述歐遊印象與感觸</h3>
<p>昨日發博書面談話</p>
<p>杜張設宴爲張洗塵</p>
<p>遊歐歸國之張學良氏、昨日發表一書面談話、報告歐行之印象與感想、及此次歸國之原因、孔財長及李杜將軍、曾於昨晨先後往訪、共叙闊别、杜月笙·張嘯林兩氏·昨晚特設宴爲張氏洗塵、並邀張氏之舊屬作陪、茲將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<h3>孔杜兩氏先後往訪</h3>
<p>行政院副院長兼財政部部長孔祥熙氏·昨日上午十時十五分、往訪張氏、長談至十一時十分始行辭出、抗日名將李杜氏、亦曾於昨日上午十時許、往訪張氏、談約半小時許、先行辭别、據米春霖氏談、孔財長之訪晤張氏係屬共聚闊别、完全爲私人友誼的拜會性質、南京電傳張氏將任軍政部部長之說、此間尙無所聞、恐非確詞、</p>
<h3>杜張昨晚設宴歡迎</h3>
<p>杜月笙·張嘯林·兩氏、昨晚七時許設宴爲張洗塵、並邀滬上各界領袖及張氏舊部鮑文樾·熒臻·王樹常·米春霖·朱光沐·李應超·沈祖同·湯國楨·諸氏作陪、直至九時許、賓主始盡歡而散、</p>
<h3>意使亦將歡宴張氏</h3>
<p>意大利駐華公使鮑斯克理氏、昨晨、曾往訪張氏、談約二十分鐘、卽行辭出、意使館航空參贊、亦將於今日往訪張氏晤談、據意使館消息、意使與張氏曾在意國晤面、友誼頗篤、故將於日内歡宴張氏、</p>
<h3>張氏發表書面談話</h3>
<p>張氏昨午發表一書面談話、其原文云、連日承新聞界諸君枉顧、請余發表談話、不知余出國至回國、共八個月又十七日、對於國内情形、非常隔膜、今天僅能把遊歷的感想、向諸位說說、我遊踪所及的地方、有意大利·瑞士·德意志·法蘭西·英吉利·丹麥·瑞典·諸國、以居意爲最久、首先感受最深的印像、當然爲他們的物質文明、與利用厚生·各種建設、然由表面上深進一層追求、眞令人感慨萬分、</p>
<h3>擁護領袖試騐主義</h3>
<p>一個感觸、是他們民衆擁護領袖的熱烈、使他們的領袖、得以放手作事、意德兩國、都是大戰後、殘敗不堪的國家、莫索里尼成旋乾轉坤之大業於前、希特勒造起死回生之偉績於後、固由於兩個領袖忠誠無私努力奮鬥之力、實是人民擁戴之熱烈有以成之、返顧我們的國裏、想要當領袖的人太多、互爭雄長、你猜我忌、假如一個首領有成功之勢、必阻力橫彺、使之功敗垂成、所以我感觸到中國人第一個亡國病症、是旣不能令、又不受命、以致組織無力、圑結難成、結果寗可受外國人的强力壓迫、也不許自家兄弟來統治、弄到今日、國不成國、連自衛的能力都没有、全國人若是不願當亡國奴、必大澈大悟、痛改這個弱點、姑容許一個領袖有試騐的機會、姑擁護一個主義使得發展其效能、然後中國始得成爲有組織的國家、然後中國始得免於沉淪永刦之禍、</p>
<h3>實行刷新人材敎育</h3>
<p>又一個感觸、是西方學者治學精神之專摯、我參觀許多學術機關、拜訪許多專門學者、我看出他們眞是把生命獻給學術、他們的大學生、沉潛攻苦的様子、眞有鐵硯磨穿的精神、不像中國好多名實不符的大學、有些先生是純爲金錢敎書、有些學生是純爲文憑讀書、還有時得了金錢不敎書、得了文憑未嘗讀書、其對於國家的供獻、不外摇旗呐喊、欲以標語口號去打倒帝國主義、結果、國家建設所眞需要的人材、大學未爲預備、大學製造的大批畢業生、社會無法位置、於是業不得人、人皆無業、羣趨於利用掠奪之一途、釀成政治上之腐化、經濟上之破産、社會上之不安、人材敎育、畢竟是救國方法之出發點、非全國辦敎育的人、共同起來刷新不可、</p>
<h3>準備應付二次大戰</h3>
<p>再一個感觸、是西方人備戰心理的濃厚、他們的心理、眞是日在矛盾的過程中演變着、他們厭惡戰爭、厭惡到萬分、恐怕到萬分、可是預備戰爭、也急到萬分、各國間之疑忌、比大戰之前夕、還要險惡、經濟會議不成功、裁軍會議開不成、與國聯基礎之摇動、全是大戰禍之預兆也、可以說全是東洋國際不安之反射、炸彈是埋好了、何時爆發、在何地爆發、且視運命的支配、但返視國人心理、好像幸災樂禍、一若世界大戰起來、中國便有辦法、其實現在若不凖備、一旦世界戰禍爆發、豈止毫無辦法、恐怕就是整個滅亡的時候、因爲屆時敵人爲戰略計、爲資源計、必佔領我國重要地帶、驅我國民、爲之服從、我國局勢、照現情形延長下去、自衛尙談不到、遑論參戰的資格、結果、惟有總崩潰、無論大戰結果如何、我國之亡一也、故國人應當大澈大悟、泯滅一切恩怨、速息鬩牆之爭、來防備未來之大禍、以上感觸、皆是我受剌激最深、而願一吐爲快的、</p>
<h3>回國原因異常戰純</h3>
<p>至於我的回國、外間也有許多揣測、本來原因異常單純、第一我是倦鳥歸林、在外國居久了、天天受剌激、心總像火一般的燃燒着、恨不能化作精禽、立刻飛來、勸國人眞正作到精誠圑結四個字、把這個多災難的國家、明天就要治好、第二、我是怱怱去國、家庭及個人私事、多未得安置、不能不淸理淸理、第三、東北難民及失業的人太多、他們不斷的給我寫信、我聽見他們的困苦情形、實在難過、也急於回來、同政府商量個根本救濟辦法、</p>
<h3>今後行止聽命政府</h3>
<p>至於我是否作事、我是當軍人的、惟有聽從命令、國家如有用我的地方、我自度力能勝任、决不敢偸閒、自度不能勝任、决不敢一誤再誤、我始終不變的志願、是維持和平、促進統一、向生産建設之路邁進、志不得行、擬再出國外、調查研究、</p>

<h3>輜重運漳</h3>
<p>㈤閩軍現因福州危急、特將一切輜重、星夜運往漳州、以防不測、</p>
<h3>大批華茶運赴蘇聯</h3>
<p>去年、蘇聯運華之貨、以木材煤油等爲大宗、煤魚疋頭等、亦間有裝來、惟以輸入過多、儲在滬上各棧者、未能短時間淸售、故自十月以後、俄貨運來較少、而蘇聯商船隊之上海班輪、亦减少開來、直至本月、又有大宗俄貨從海參崴運來、由「蘇介吉洛夫」號船裝到者、除大批木材外、又有疋頭棉羢洋布等一千數百箱、到滬之後、昨已開始起卸、另有一船、滿裝俄貨、係華北商家定購、故赴津起卸、然後再來上海、裝貨赴俄、</p>
<h3>茶磚運崴</h3>
<p>我國運俄去貨、以茶磚一項最多、去冬俄商購定新茶磚、與前次購存陳茶磚、因無船運裝、儲在漢口上海者、計三個月來共有一萬噸左右、現經俄商與蘇聯隊商定、卽於「蘇介吉洛夫」等兩船、日内由滬、先裝新陳茶磚七千噸赴俄、係往海參崴、轉運莫斯科、連日東鐵駐滬辦事處、辦理報裝手續甚忙、明後日卽開始運載、今次運俄茶磚、價値三四百萬元、</p>
<h3>封港阻航</h3>
<p>蘇聯商船隊、毎年向上海租用大批華輪、往海參崴、至堪察加沿海岸、運載海産品木材等來華、昨據駐滬經理處人員語記者、海參崴至堪察加天氣奇寒、早已封凍、航運不通、所租華商輪、已陸續解約退租、暫行止航、須俟今年四月分開凍後、再可通行、故目前運來上海貨、均係海參崴所存積者、蘇聯隊暫時派用本隊自有船、行駛滬崴一路、故此次到滬兩船、均爲蘇俄旗號、租用華輪、將俟三月中接洽、</p>
<h3>貨運華北</h3>
<p>近數月來、蘇聯貨物銷塲、已漸次由南至北、華北方面、需用俄貨、似較華南爲多、蘇聯隊現有租輪數艘、常駛海參崴至靑島與天津、毎月至少有兩船開往、而載去之貨物、又次次滿儎也、</p>
<h3>滬閩間電報現尙不能暢通</h3>
<p>因戰事破壞甚大</p>
<p>一時尙難以修復</p>
<p>滬閩間有線電報、自戰事發生後、卽告中斷、賴以通逹消息者、僅厦門及汕頭兩處之無線電台、交通部茲爲便利客商通訊起見、特在浙江邊境之泰順·慶元·景寗·三處設立電報支局一所、收發商業電報、上海電報局、亦已開始收發、至福建·延平·古田·水口·等處、雖告克復、因軍事關係、各電線被破壞頗多、修理需時、故以上各處、有線電報、現尙不克照常暢通</p>
<h3>孔祥熙昨來滬</h3>

<h3>中波直接通讯</h3>
<p>希里魯斯號郵船昨第一次抵滬</p>
<p>吉狄尼亞埠將爲波蘭轉運口岸</p>
<p>字林報云、藍煤囱公司郵船希里魯斯號今日）十一日（自波蘭吉狄尼亞港Gdynia駛抵本埠、此實中波口岸直接通航之第一次、彼與航運無直接關係者、對於此舉、不免等閒視之、而一般與歐洲西北各國通商之各商行、則甚重視此舉者、希里魯斯號、於十一月二十五日、駛離吉狄尼亞、其經過之處、爲漢堡·洛特丹·波賽·檳榔·斯威唐漢港·新加坡·上海·大連·門司·神户·目前定爲星期班、將由藍烟囱公司與愛勒曼布克諾爾公司維持之、下次抵滬者、爲巴士城號、已於十二月十六日駛離吉狄尼亞、二月三日可抵滬埠、往日歐洲西北與遠東間商貨運輸、輒以漢堡或洛特丹爲歐洲終點、故里加與其他波羅的海各大口岸貨之欲運往遠東者、須先運往該二地、嗣後祇須運至吉狄尼亞、故吉狄尼亞將成波蘭東部各口岸轉運之中心點矣、</p>
<h3>絲廠停業殆盡</h3>
<p>大受日絲傾銷影響</p>
<p>現開工者僅祗五家</p>
<p>農村破産工人失業</p>
<p>我國絲業以國外貿易爲大宗、在民國二十年秋季、日本絲商、由日政府津貼、將大批存絲、向歐美市塲傾銷、對於價格、特别减低、以致華絲大受打擊、隨之步跌、Ｂ字等級、毎擔一千兩跌至六百兩、去年秋季、日絲傾銷更烈、致華絲毎擔自九百元跌至五百元、尙無交易、絲商虧本太鉅、無法維持、瀕於破産、</p>
<h3>絲價步跌</h3>
<p>我國絲商受傾銷影響後、去年秋初、將女工工資、毎日頭號由五角减爲四角五分、藉維現狀、奈因歐美市塲、華絲仍不見起色、市價繼續步跌、不得已暫行停業、以待時機、及至去年十月底、本市一百十三家、單雙宮絲廠、勉强維持開工者、僅寳泰·福綸恒等十三家、</p>
<h3>各廠停工</h3>
<p>自今年起、華絲上海市價、外銷Ｂ字等級、毎擔爲五百元、國内綢廠用户、毎擔爲五百四十元、但外銷僅有市價、而無交易、國内用户、因織綢業受日本絲織品傾銷南洋羣島一帶之影響、華綢外銷大减、致綢廠無法維持、亦紛紛停業、據新新社記者之調查、截止昨日、本市僅龍華寳泰第二·日暉橋寳泰第一·虹口永亨·廟頭恒蒼等五家、</p>
<h3>桑地改種</h3>
<p>自華絲暴跌後、各絲廠商收買鮮繭時、竭力壓低繭價、俾將成本减低、以抵以前之損失、去年春秋兩季、繭價毎擔平均自五十元跌至二三十元、育蠶農民、受極大打擊、農民經濟、均屬貧苦、育蠶時所需資金、大都重利借來、因此無法償還、江浙兩地農民、因育蠶失敗而發生慘劇者甚多、同時農民鑒於育蠶之無利可圖、往往將桑地改種其他農産品、以致桑地减少、江蘇省民國十九年桑地爲二十五萬一千畝、民國二十一年已减爲八萬四千畝、去年及今年、預料更須减少、</p>
<h3>繭産減少</h3>
<p>種桑地減少後、蠶繭之産額勢必隨之銳減、如江蘇省當盛時、毎年産乾繭十五萬担、約合鮮繭四十五萬担、浙江省産乾繭十萬担、約合鮮繭三十萬担、但去年蘇省僅産鮮繭二十三萬担、浙省僅産鮮繭十萬担、與往年産額比較大減、江浙兩省農村之衰落、最重要原因、實爲育蠶失敗、</p>
<h3>政府救濟</h3>

<h3>民航爭加聯運中大埔航運復振</h3>
<p>跌價競裝客貨</p>
<p>大埔海港漲水</p>
<p>隴海路局與招商辦理水陸聯運後、引起民航激爭、老窑通航後、大埔港各民航、初時甚爲恐慌、深慮商貨斷絶、營業影響、詎意事有出人意料者、大埔港貨運、近來較未聯運時更爲擁擠、港口水尺亦深、民航輪次次滿儎、無如運費大跌、航界暗虧至巨、亟將此事詳情、查誌如下、</p>
<h3>報關行合作拉貨</h3>
<p>隴海路開駛老窑聯運班、直接裝西北來貨、而將大埔港四十二家報關行擯絶不用、改由路局直接辦理、各報關行以根本營業攸關、極力與西北各處貨主接洽、拉攏到大埔下船、一面與滬上民航各輪局磋商、與聯運同等待遇、一切轉運事務、統歸報關行負責辦理、對路局方面、諉稱貨往靑島、與聨運絶無妨害、居然逹到願望、</p>
<h3>輪公司减價競運</h3>
<p>海州貨毎噸水脚、原定六元以上、自聯運開辦後、路航兩方、訂定毎噸水脚祇收三元五角、客家因價廉省事、故競裝聨運船矣、今大埔各報關行與滬上大振合衆等各輪局商定、亦將運費改跌、援照路航定率、亦减收三元五角一噸、忍痛競裝、以維航業、惟在實際上恐須虧本、但實逼處此、非此不能營業也、</p>
<h3>大埔貨擁擠裝載</h3>
<p>自此競航以來、隴海路東運貨客家、指定到大埔交卸者、日見增多、大振公司泳平泳安二輪毎次來滬、貨物總在八百噸以上、泳吉輪昨日到滬、裝有一千四百噸之多、合衆輪到來、亦班班滿儎、貨物之擁、較諸往日爲甚、據航界中人言、如此跌價競裝、客家獲得實惠、而輪局方面、爭羣衆的利益、使大埔港數千人生活有着、公司本身殊無利可言耳、</p>
<h3>海港水尺亦見深</h3>
<p>大埔港海口時常淤塞、以前海輪到該處、祇可裝四百噸貨、多則便擱淺、近來大埔港突然變遷、港内海水、平常忽增、在退潮際、亦有十三尺吃水、故泳吉可運一千四百噸貨、而安然行駛、記者又詢大振公司、對於民航參加聯運一事、如何進行、據該公司言、此事尙須候部中核定後、組織聯運的聯合辦事處、然後再議分配船舶運駛、在未經實現前、民航公司、照現狀行駛耳、</p>
<h3>中航公司被扣試航機法使電允放還</h3>
<p>轉知安南總督證明發還</p>
<p>預料今日可飛安南境地</p>
<p>復興社云、中國航空公司在西南試航之飛機、因氣候關係、被迫降落於法屬安南可防後、卽被法當局扣留、由駕駛該機之機師安利遜、及機航主任聶開一、至「河内」拍電來滬報告、滬公司當卽立電交通部呈報、並請證明、交部亦卽咨請外交部、轉向法國駐華公使、請證明發還、茲悉該公司昨已接交部電告、法公使已有覆電、允卽轉知安南總督、證明係中國民用航機、着卽放還、故預料今日（十二日）當可由可防飛出、經龍州而抵雲南、轉渝、沿江返滬云、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>我們所需要的「讀書指導」（二）</h3>
<p>｜以我們的工作方向答羅大璋先生；</p>
<p>並求敎於關心我們工作的朋友。</p>
<p>我們以無限的榆快接受社會對我們新創的小小事業所給予的回聲。我們工作開始雖然還不到一週而收到朋友們的鼓勵與建設的函件已逹數十通了。社會對我們如此的注意，使我們非常惶悚；同時更說明了我們工作的客觀的需要。它是當前急應做的而社會上還無人出來提倡的一件事。</p>
<p>現在，我們大膽的開端了。但確實祇能說是「開端」而已。因爲這正如羅君之言「前途的困難，恐怕比辦一所大學還難得多」；並且社會上並無舊例，可供我們的參考，一切均在試騐中，將來做到如何的程度，現在誰也不能預定。但是，工作的方向我們却是早已預定下了的。</p>
<p>「讀書指導」不是少數熱心家，憑自已一時的高興，從個人的理想爲出發點，它是基於我們圖書館的客觀要求，從眼前迫切的事實作爲工作的起點、所以羅君提出「指導的中心應注意目前讀者實踐生活」、完全與我們的意見相一致。如果以生活爲主體，一切敎育在廣義上都可解作生活的指導，讀書自然變爲手段了。不過，生活的指導卽就敎育而言，也是多方面的，我們固應注意：指導讀書，不要忘了這讀書是作爲讀者生活的補充，不是目的，而我們却難負起眞正作彺活的指導。好在實踐生活中的敎訓比什麽都來得大，讀者旣然都是在實際生活中掙扎的人，生活的閲歷自然可以指示他應走的道路。我們只能或只應供給大家經騐的補充（卽讀書），事象的分析，因果法則的指示，路是讓大家自已去走的。所以羅君要我們「注意生活的指導」，我們在原則上完全同意，但事實上只能做到這様。所以，在讀者方面說，讀書是手段，不是目的；而在我們這方面，似乎指導讀書也成我們的目的了。</p>
<p>除以上原則的討論外，羅君關於我們工作方面還提出了許多可寳貴的意見。因爲我們的工作，是根據我們草訂的「計劃」而進行的，現在且將我們目前實施的步驟，概述如後，同時求敎於羅君。</p>
<p>不錯！我們是甘於「無聲無色」的。因爲我們工作的實踐，决定了我們工作的内容。事實决定了我們不是在這裏辦大學，開學院，也不是爲社會育英才，造博士；所以湧到我們周圍來的是勤勞的一羣，與我們相探討的是日常生活中尊嚴而又卑賤，至大或又微小，一般或又特殊，高深或又淺薄，總括一句是「上下古今」「天堂地獄」一切生活動流中，所發生的一切問題的經歷。但不是拉雜的灌輸，是由實際去貫串，融成一定的聯繫，是有系統的指導。我們討論的範圍自然比大學講堂上談的要博，要淺，要瑣屑；却無心去爲能進大學的人作純粹理論的說敎。所以我們的工作進程是先着手對於讀者生活實况的調查，要讀者自已提了實際的需要的要求，作出個人讀書計劃，介紹於他自已生活所需要的讀物，解决讀物中不易了解的疑難，我們雖然從實際中認淸大家的要求，但我們决不迎保低級趣味，降低文化的水凖。我們要從對建帝國主義的意識中解放出來提高一般文化水準。</p>
<p>我們希望大家認淸我們工作的方向，不要作過高或事實上不能辦到的希望。</p>
<p>雖然如此、我們也知道我們的任務巨大。所以開始工作前，我們就有數月之準備，聘有數十位同情我們的專家，爲本部的專門顧問。所以凡是本部同人不能解决的疑難可由專門顧問解答之。因此，所謂「封鎖大家的意見」自是不會發生。我們知道我們工作的完成不僅自已的努力，與專家取得合作，尤其在與讀者能取得密切的聯繫，才可獲得相當的成績。</p>
<p>總之：我們對讀者第一是不作欺騙的僞語，不作嚇人而空洞的約言。第二，是我們做到那裏是那裏，不作過高的希望。卽就指導讀書的方面言，也只能概略的指示一條大家認爲必由的道路，是否充實，是否澈底，也還難十分自信。不過，我們總竭誠盡力的以求於已於人，兩無愧色。至於充實我們的工作，那是要從工作實踐中才能産生的，不是一兩個熱心人在寫字間中所可創造出的。</p>
<p>這就是我們工作的方向。</p>
<p>最後，我們希望羅君及關心我們工作的人時常賜以敎言和批評。並望讀者切實與我們取得密切的合作。</p>

<h3>浙省嘉區六縣代表留附小主任</h3>
<p>浙省嘉中附小自沈雷漁氏接事以後、校務蒸蒸日上、輔導工作、尤見努力、惟近以辦事棘手、致沈氏心力交瘁、遽萌退志、迭經敎廳勸勉、嘉中張校長及附小敎員等一再慰留、均未能打銷其辭意、聞該區崇德等六縣敎育局長又集議一致挽留、並呈請敎廳不予照准、一面派平湖嘉善崇德三縣代表南請張校長顧念六縣行方敎育、懇切挽留沈主任、聞張校長已允尊重六縣代表之意見、沈氏亦允加以考慮、</p>
<h3>敎部督學周邦道談視察豫省敎育近况</h3>
<p>敎部督學周邦道、視察陜豫兩省敎育歸來、對於、陜西敎育情形、曾記述其談話、詳刋報端、茲承詳談河南敎育近况、記述於下、</p>
<p>豫省敎育經常費、本年度二百三十七萬五千一百九十二元、臨時費約二十二萬元、共計約二百六十萬元、其最大來源、爲買當契税、次爲學校欵産收入、敎廳設有敎育欵産管理處、各縣設有契税經理局、省縣敎育經費均已獨立有年、數量亦屬可觀、惟職敎社敎經費所占成數、衡以部定標凖、相差尙遠、</p>
<p>豫省各種敎育機關、爲數頗多、尤以縣立師範校數、除河北省外、罕有其匹、㈠高等敎育有省立大學一、省立專科學校一、私立學院一、㈡中等敎育甲·「中學」初級中學省立十六、縣立二十三、聯立一、私立三十七、高級中學省立二、附設二、初高級合設者省立三、私立四、乙·「師範」省立八、縣立七十三、丙·「職業」初級職業、省立三、縣立二十一、私立一、高級職業、附設一、初高級合設者省立三、㈢初等敎育、甲·初級小學縣立二千二百一十、鄉區立一萬一千零九十三、私立二千一百六十三、乙·高級小學縣立七十三、鄉區立三十九、私立十、丙·完全小學省立十一、附設九、縣立四百七十二、鄉區立二百七十四、私立四十三、丁·幼稚園公立二十二、㈣社會敎育有省立民衆敎育館八十九、圖書館一百三十五、博物館一、美術館一、民衆學校一千四百六十八、閲報處一千五百三十一、體育塲八十四、講演所八、私人設立遊藝塲十六、</p>
<p>省縣敎育行政機關組織完整、對於敎育法令之推行、頗爲迅速、縣敎育局分五等、各設局長一人、一二等設督學二人、課主任三人、課員三人、三四等設督學一人、課主任課員各二人、五等設督學課主任各一人、課員二人、</p>
<p>敎廳設有開封敎育實騐區委員會、由李步靑君主持一切、内開封的兒童與民衆爲實騐對象、是一個實騐初等敎育與社會敎育之主腦機關、内分七部、一測騐部、二活用敎材編輯部、三實騐敎育月刋編輯部、四大花園敎育村、五杏花園敎育鎭、六兒童科學館、七衛生委員會、各部份工作、均頗緊張、且多創舉、河南兒童科學館最近開幕、開封各小學兒童、均有機會使用該館儀器藥品標本圖表之屬、此種集中設備辦法、異常經濟、切合需要、惟該館係由實騐區委員會設立、範圍又限於開封、如改組爲開封兒童科學館、當較恰切、省立開封第十小學、由該委員會領導試行二重制、一年來試行結果尙佳、據云已可節省幾個敎員和敎室、此制如逐漸演進改良、並擴充試行範圍、將來大可以彌補一般二部制之不足、</p>
<p>省立各小學試行二部制者、多係增加班級、分派各敎員以若干義務鐘點、鎭天直接敎學與普通班級無異、據云係維持家長平素對於學校之信仰、有不得已之苦衷、但此種辦法、似已失去二部制之本來的意義、有亟需研究改進之必要、</p>
<p>此次所到地方不多、就會經視察學校論、開封省立一小、十小、省立汲縣師範附小、辦理頗有精神、汲縣鞏縣、偃師等縣縣立小學、亦多可觀、鞏縣一小女小、校址過於低窪潮灦、敎員學生因而患瘧疾脚疾者甚多、亟需遷移、登封一小、校舍陳舊、光線暗淡殊不合用、</p>
<p>省立洛陽女中、開辦不久、校舍布置、尙見整雅、省立汲縣初中、女子初中、敎學管理、均頗認眞、偃師縣立初級中學、設有女子師範班職業補習班、師範成績、均多可取、惟校舍分成四院、間隔太遠、生活上管理上殊感困難、開封私立北倉女中、學生完全住校、限制請假、一切活動、完全由學生自治會主持、敎職員居於指導監督地位、自治能力之優越、不易多見、私立黎明初中、學生亦完全住校、在上課時間、無論有課與否、概須至敎室點名、課督自修、尙屬嚴格、敎薪以科目性質及任職所限、分别訂定、亦頗公允、私立兩河初中、毎班設有訓導、平時試騐概在課外舉行、時間頗爲經濟、汲縣私立豫北初中、敎職員刻苦努力、上年度畢業學生百分之九十以上均已考入省立高級中等學校肄業、鄭縣私立明新初中、圖様儀器年有增益、最近試行訓練週制、根據事實上之需要、决定德目、各年級或同德目異標凖、或德目標凖、完全不同、前後連續進行、限期考察結果、實事求是、禮常切當、以上幾個私立中學精神均頗特别、所有辦法、亦多足資觀摩之處、</p>
<p>各縣縣立師範、多係三年制、與現章不合、亟須延長年限、改爲簡易師範、省立汲縣師範、校舍整潔、管訓嚴格、畢業學生服務成績頗佳、省立輝縣百泉鄉村師範係百泉書院舊址、爲姚雪齋趙仁甫孫夏峯諸大儒講學之所、泉通百道、晝夜噴沸、樓閣亭台、風景幽雅、辦有實騐區、鄉会醫院、鄉民工廠、合作社、農塲、廢除星期暑假及一切例假、實行警衛、師生共同活動、毎晨五時半卽起床早操、操畢舉行農會、精神藡勃、學風優良、爲此次看見最有特色充滿朝氣之學校、但敎育科目、設置嫌多、各級學生分成鄉村學校與鄉村社會二組、從整個的鄉村師範敎育說、未免近於割裂、</p>
<p>省立開封染織業校、省立汲縣初級染織職校、工廠出品、均尙可觀、開封職校所織、種類尤多、但貨品堆積、不設法銷售殊爲失策、畢業學生多係升學、或充當小學敎員、或賦閒家居、從事染織職業者爲數甚少、上年度開封職校畢業學生十五人、多數充各縣工廠技師、差强人意、省立鄭縣職工學校去年八月開辦、暫設化學工藝科、分技師班工匠班、刻正籌設工廠、該處交通便利、校長且甚熱心、將來應易進展、聞豫省有建敎合作計畫、如能實現、職敎前途、彌多裨益、</p>
<p>各校勞作敎學、多與以前手工課無異、惟省立百泉鄉師之農塲實習、洒掃、站崗、澆花、灌竹及修路、輝縣縣立師範之砌路、種花、省立汲縣師範之平舖操塲、省立鄭縣職工學校之修築馬路、私立明新中學之編織柳條、製造電池、範圍比較擴充、作業亦頗實在、開封各校工藝作品、經張君巨杉之倡導、種類式様及用途、均饒有敎育的意味云、</p>
<h3>敎部批答周曉眞請頒行七巧板注音符號一案之經過</h3>
<p>周曉眞爲欲頒行七巧板注音符號、曾屢在上海申報刋登廣告、對於較部之批答、表示不服、茲據敎部負責人談、周曉眞案、發生於民國二十年、先是周曉眞以七巧板排成注音符號、名爲注音符號遊戲、呈部審查、本部以旣係用於遊戲、當卽批示准於發行、嗣周曉眞又呈請補助印行、並請由部公布印發、本部以補助一節、碍難照准、至請求公布、事與國語有關、應發交國語統一籌備委員會核議、經該會核議結果、認爲不能公布、駁斥理由六條、約二千言、均係根據學理立論、其結論略謂、「本會以周曉眞所著注音符號遊戲、利用世俗玩具七巧板、排成四十注音符號的略形、用來帮助注音符號的練習、爲兒童敎育玩具中方法之一、尙無不可、至所擬改正注音符號印刷體及說明、竟想把這七巧板玩具、排成的形體、作爲注音符號之基本式様、楷書草書、及印刷界鑄造銅模、均以此爲標凖、用來代替部頒的注音字母書法體式、本會細爲審核、所排形體、有僅僅略似注音符號的、有傾斜的、有偏畸的、有筆畫不淸的、照式書寫、無從着手、照鑄鉛字、不成行列、除作爲兒童的玩具遊戲外、别無用處、所請公布頒發之處、似可勿庸置議」云云、嗣該周曉眞具文呈請復審、本部以事關學術研究、不厭求詳、復將原案發交國語統一籌備會再審、在再審中、忽接其子周燦連發兩電、一則曰父憂七巧音符泣血失眠、再則曰父哭音符暈、而本部仍准國語統一籌委會之請、取其以七巧板帮助注音符號練習之點、止准注音符號遊戲、自由出版、並得自由籌造鉛字、印刷試用、並於該書出版時、得於書面上、刋印、「經敎育部審查准予發行」等字様、所請由部頒行之處、仍無庸議、乃該周曉眞堅執成見、非由部頒行不可、凟請不已、並具呈人如此喋嘵不休、逾越常態、以後對於來呈、遂概不予批答、蓋政令頒布、必須審愼周詳、斷無因私人凟請、卽輕於予以公布之理、該周曉眞如果再不覺悟、任意在各報上登載啓事、以非法侮辱之言詞、淆亂聞聽、本部將不能繼續寛恕之也、</p>

<h3>昨晚西靑籃球曁南力抗海賊</h3>
<p>結果卅一比四五敗北</p>
<p>西靑籃球昨賽甲組僅有一塲、曁南有優美表演、海賊雖强、亦徒呼負負、下半時曁南曾一度以二十三對二十超出、結果雖以三十一對四十五力盡而敗、但已予海賊一番威迫、此外乙組兩塲、慕爾以四十五對十七大勝法軍、同文勝幼級、賽成一面倒、上半時十九對五、結果五十對十七、</p>
<p>海賊勝曁南</p>
<p>曁南最近數戰、表演頗佳、昨與海賊交鋒、賽來局勢緊張、比數相差常在數分間、直至最後五分鐘、曁南始不支而敗、開賽初、海賊光芒四射、卡爾遜賴恩得分屢屢、頃刻間以十對一導先、曁南急起直追、韓振元有投必中、上半時追成十七對二十、再戰聲中、曁南無往不利、顧尙動連撥進兩球、黃兆霖錦上添花、頓以二十三對二十超出、海賊努力加鞭、長人賴恩獲得三分後、史密斯造成二十五對二十三之優勢、此後曁南卽望塵莫及、雖靠黃兆霖之遠軃、曾打成二十七對二十九、三十一對三十三、在後緊緊追隨、但至最後數分鐘、曁南聲勢一落千丈、連失六球、結果以三十一對四十五敗北</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>一九三四年式</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>時間與空間，銜住了尾巴，「不息」而「無隙」，所以一切都會得進步，而日新月異。不用說得，在民國二十三年裏，自然，又與民國二十二年不同，玩着民國二十二年所不會玩，不敢玩，不能玩，或是想不到玩的一切新鮮玩意兒。</p>
<p>今日是民國二十三年正月之朔，人壽幾何，及時行樂耳，所以在這歲首，我們該尋一個快活，才是人生大道理。誰長聲吁，短聲嘆，憂時傷國，怕着亡國滅種的，是傑出的天字元號雙料大椶子，該請小子們鳴鼓而攻之。</p>
<p>今日該「只談風月，不談國事。」</p>
<p>談到風月，自然又忘不了，而且是少不了女人。民國二十三年，就是一九三四年了，不知一九三四年的女人，又流行怎麽的一個模様兒。在去年，最摩登的女人，是健而美，所以有很多女人，都跑到沙灘上去曬成優黑色，據說可成爲美不可言的女人。「弱不禁風」，已經落伍了，一九三三年式的健而美，到了一九三四年，怕也已經不怎麽吃香了。據我的理想，今年或許該流行「裸體了吧。</p>
<p>風月之事，「女人」之外，該談到「飲」的問題。酒，俗人會飲，雅人也會飲，但是中國酒已不列於摩登之羣，洋酒，因美國已開酒禁，物不稀，便不足爲貴，無疑地，在民國二十三年中，或許已不怎麽能受人重視。茶，現在，已衰退了，你瞧，出口量一落千丈，外國人都不歡迎了，怎能算是一九三四年的標準飲料。我搯指一算，今年是活該咖啡當道。瞧着罷，在民國二十三年中，老虎灶老闆，或許會括掉了招牌上的「茶字」，而代以「咖啡」。的確，咖啡眞够味，因爲是比了甚麽都新奇，從中國的歷史上看來。</p>
<p>建築，汽車，皮鞋，大衣，甚至走路，烫髮，哭笑，打嚔，無可避免的，從二十二年到二十三年，都得來一個新花様。大家儘瞪大着眼瞧罷。</p>
<h3>江北孩子</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>江北人，幾於無地不有他們的蹝跡，有人說『世界上人類的生活力最强，要算是日本人，若照中國各省論，那末，可算是江北人最耐苦，而能爭生存於現在的環境；不消說沿鐵路的地方，兩旁都有老的小的江北婆和小孩子，在那裏拾煤塊過他們的日子，就是内地各縣各鎭，也都是他們以棲以息以生的所在；唉！江北人雖賤，江北人實在也是『天助自助』的人們，人家都瞧不起他，我反要稱贊他一聲，是民族性中最能掙扎最能奮鬭的好百姓！</p>
<p>他處不論，就從吾們嘉定一縣地方，雖在附郭，而江北人好像聚族而居一般；起初來的時候，不過一隻艒艒船，到後來船已壞了，就擱在旁岸的河灘上，拿船來當屋子住，這是第一步；他們的生活是怎様？賣菱，賣薑，賣水果，不斷的做小生意！尤其佩服的他們生殖力也和别處不同，譬如江北一男一女，夫婦兩人外，總有孩子三四個，若在夏秋的天氣，他們總是赤裸裸的，像在原人時代的自在着；就是天氣冷了，他們也會穿起人家所抛棄的破鞋破帽破襖來和西風搏戰；凍得鼻頭紅紅的，兩隻手伸出來倒還是白白的，在天熱時候，隨路拾着蘿菽皮去，當作燃料，所以江北人在這種地方，就是孩子們，也是一椿公德事；因爲道路上可以淸潔，不致生出許多蒼蠅，比衛生警察淸道夫來的普徧；現在冬天，在朝晨江北孩子三五成羣的，又拾着菜板菜葉，可以使市面上乾凈，眞是不可及的一種勞力，試問人家七八歲的兒童，婦養慣常，怕風又怕水，能幹這様的事麽？故我以爲江北人說起知識，那末，固然是不足，倘拿中國目前民窮財盡，要想救亡圖存，博得最後自立的地位，例是江北孩子，値得可以做個模範，因爲他們能『吃苦』，能『勤勞』，這是實在令人可敬的！</p>
<p>吾們一縣裏江北人來做生意的，究竟有多少，没有人調查過，大約不在少數；起初來的時候很是窮困，現在也有小康的，而願做土著，和當地人攀了親，所以他們的孩子們，失了江北人的種性，和本地同化了；還有仍在三間兩間茅屋裏過生活的，也稍有積蓄，而他們的孩子們，據說毎日還是喫蕃芋皮過日子，而他們的面貎倒也肥胖，人家到了冬天，要生凍瘃，他們倒面光皮滑，你想！這不是『天助自助』的明證麽？</p>
<h3>從駝子到啞子</h3>
<p>— 氏之</p>
<p>起初，摩登靑年向摩登小姐追求時候，小心翼翼，彎着身兒，低聲下氣，好像『駝子』。</p>
<p>其後，摩登靑年和摩登小姐發生了愛情，實行同居，出則偕行，入則同歸，寸步不離，又似握手杖放不下手的『跛子』。</p>
<p>再後，摩登靑年和摩登小姐走到百貨公司裏去，小姐年看見各種華貴的飾物，戀戀不捨，要靑年購這個，買那個，靑年聞若未聞，裝作一個『聾子』。</p>
<p>再後，摩登小姐有些厭惡摩登靑年了，獨自個兒出去，和男朋友厮混，跳舞，看電影，打高而夫球，：：：摩登靑年雖然一一看在眼裏，只好視若無睹，做了一個『瞎子』。</p>
<p>最後，摩登小姐提出離婚，向摩登靑年索取贍養費，摩登靑年已失了戀人，又要吃官司，拿出錢來，氣得口也開不出來，好似一個『啞子』。</p>
<h3>天韻樓</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>要把那靑色的電梯擠破了似的。這時候兒可分不得男和女，他們和我們的身子緊貼着。高肩大　攤邊絲絨帽，黑皮領裏的小臉，混糊的眼珠子，血紅嘴唇｜脂粉氣息和留蘭香。</p>
<p>擠着，擠着。『嚓』的電梯停住。人，像脫了網罟的鳥，各自没方向地飛開啦</p>
<p>這兒别有一番天地。</p>
<p>有戴打鳥帽的勞動份子，有穿長袍短掛的靑年紳士（？），有鄉下姑娘，有：：</p>
<p>女招待，那麽挺漂亮的娘兒哪，公館裏少奶奶似的，可是，没少奶奶們舒服呢，提着銅吊兒，絞着手巾把兒，得往人堆裏去擠，對毎一個人｜說不定自已所最憎惡的粗魯漢，也得陪着笑，讓人家在伊們面前打哈哈。伊們在賣笑，伊們又還賣了貞操。</p>
<p>在黑黝黝的影戲塲裏，男子幾乎都懷着一顆野獸的心，誘惑力從那些：：那些：：女人們的身上發出｜伊們雙頰焦黃，瘦削的嘴臉，站立在每一個塲角，被那些老媽子在一邊監視着，生活告訴伊們：『你們把肉體和靈魂去換飯吃！』</p>
<p>於是，輕顰淺笑，於是，慾火的燃燒。瞧吧，社會的矛盾在這裏。</p>
<p>在這裏，白電燈光到處亮着，鑼鼓，胡琴擊奏出生命的呐喊『喂，朋友；這是娛樂的塲合嗎？』仲坡拉拉我的胳膊　　朝下一望，電車，汽車，一連串一連串的來去着，還有那小得可憐的黃包車夾在中間，行走的人像螞蟻爬。我們到了都市的最高峯。</p>
<p>我們瘋狂的笑啦，對着那面旗幟，給風刮破了的『天韻樓』。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十一回</p>
<p>絮語燈前苦心訓弱息</p>
<p>杖游山下冷眼看英雄</p>
<p>趙翁在衫袖籠裏抽出一塊手絹擦了兩下額頭，臉上紅紅的向積之道：老弟台，你瞧怎麽様？我對付着没有丢醜吧？積之笑着點點頭道：好的！這呌龍生龍子，虎生豹兒，有了老太爺這種精神，怪不得趙連長是一條好漢了。我們先找個地喝碗水，再慢慢的上山，你看好嗎？回去的時候，乾脆騎驢，那也要不了多少工夫就到家了。趙翁點點頭道：好的，那兒有個小茶館。積之笑道：到了這裏，就省不得錢了。這茶館門對着上山的人行路雅座兒在後面，有窗户也只好看我們來的那條大路。我們不如到西山飯店樓下找個散坐兒，對了山上坐着。這西山飯店後面，零零碎碎的紅葉，也有個意思。這個小東，我是當候的，你千萬别客氣。趙翁雖是不願意到這種貴族式的飯座裏去喝茶，可是和積之新交，旣不便拂逆了人家的好意，而且也怕人疑自已是躱避會鈔。便笑道：你們穿西裝的朋友，要講個衛生的，鄉茶館裏，你們是不肯進去的。積之笑道：喝一壼茶，一塊錢罷了。若是這様的小東，都不能做，那也就太難了。說着話，他就在前面引路，將趙翁引到山麓西山飯店來。這個時候，雖然，是國難臨頭，然而住在舊京城裏和人，除了覺到報紙上所登的日本兩個字，比較要多一點而外，其餘並無什麽感觸，所以聽戲的還是聽戲，吃館子的還是吃館子，跳舞的還是跳舞。自然，那些享樂的人，毎年要跑出幾十里路來看一次紅葉的，當然還是來看紅葉。（二八九）</p>

<h3>金華觀鬥牛記　（下）</h3>
<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>因爲我們知道，牛是一種性氣很蠻的東西、所鬥的又是水牛，水牛不是往往有兩支很尖利的長角嗎？這様鬥起來，豈不可怕，但是到塲上一看，才知道竟和理想完全相反：第一這種水牛和尋常的不同，頭上的角不到半尺長，而且是蜷曲的，正好覆在牠自已的前額上，像人的頭髮一様，根本無從跳觸；再加在鬥的時候，每條牛的前額上都縛着一方極堅靱的皮革，使牠們不至探傷皮肉，所以自有鬥牛以來，流血的事情是誰得看見的。（牛主的械鬥當然例外）</p>
<p>開始角鬥的時候，雙方牛主各自指揮着四五個人把牛從塲角上牽將出來，同時，四圑的觀衆便像給名角捧塲似的紛紛喝起采來；就在一陣喝采聲裏，雙方都把牛嘴上勒着的繩索鬆了，讓牠們兩下裏頭對頭的撞着，頂着；祗要兩顆腦袋一义開，塲上的公證人便會搶上前去替牠們糾正，務必合牠們依着規則角鬥。｜就是一味用頭和頭頂，看那一條能够頂得使對方後退，以致無力反攻，便算勝了。</p>
<p>鬥牛的情形，大概就是這様而已；但是作者當塲曾找到一位金華老先生，向他請問過幾句話，他所給予我的答案，都是使我很滿意的，現在便附記在下面，讀者看了，多少可以長些見識。</p>
<p>「鬥牛的風俗，是否限於金華一地？」我的問句。</p>
<p>「不！浙東一帶，如江山，諸曁，衢縣，永康，嵊縣，泰順，各地都有這種風俗，而且多比金華熱鬧；尤其是嵊縣，鬥牛之後，接着往往是鬥人，近來聽說已經禁止了。」金華老先生的答復。</p>
<p>「這種牛形似水牛，何以没有長角？」我又問。</p>
<p>「這本是一種特殊的水牛，專養着鬥的。」</p>
<p>「牠們能耕田嗎？」</p>
<p>「絶對不能！」</p>
<p>「那末牛主人養着牠們有什麽好處呢？」我進一步的問。</p>
<p>「能够鬥得勝，便可以贏錢，因爲他們往往是先下了注然後才放鬥的。少的十元，二十元，多的百元以上也不甚希罕，所以往往要發生衝突了！」</p>
<p>「聽說這些年在毎次未鬥之前的幾天裏，牛主人往往用人參等補品去餧養牠。眞有這種情形嗎？」</p>
<p>「這都是外縣人的形容過火！」金華老先生竭力摇着他那一雙雞爪似的雙手，否認眞有這種駭人聽聞的事情。「不過特揀精細一些的草料讓牠們吃吃罷了，那裏會下這様大本錢。至多也不過在臨鬥前灌些黃酒給牛吃，發發牠的性子而已。」</p>
<p>「原來好此！因爲這様說的人太多了，所以大家都信以爲眞了！」我微笑着說。</p>
<p>「那末鄉下人都說上海姑娘不穿褲子，奈道也是眞有這種情形嗎？」金華老先生的談鋒端的不差。</p>
<p>「好，多謝指敎！」我忙表示信服他的話。接着又換了一個問題。「那末鬥牛的事情，是否只有秋季，或冬季舉行？」</p>
<p>「不！什麽時候都有。因爲鬥牛本是娛神的一種意思，所以毎當某一尊神道重修金身，或開光的日子，或生日，便有鬥牛了。</p>

<p>裁兵續漲一元六七角</p>
<p>餘亦好數角至一元半</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、因戰事消息、依然良好、閩事將有急轉直下之趨向、福州指日可下、二十三年新關税公債一萬萬、雖屬决定發行、但不在市塲流通、與市面當然毫無妨碍、晚間消息、中央軍已逼近福州、各債市大都又發現新高價、大户如十五三十五及四十六號等頗有賣出、其中尤以四十六號賣出爲最湧、但仍覺供不應求、不啻揚湯止沸、因十六五十四及七十五號等、需要極殷、加以北帮及散户紛紛購買、四十六號壓力雖大、竟毫無效力、趨勢已有軋空形勢、前途尙未必遽見回跌也、昨日上午開盤、初則漲風甚熾、裁兵衝出六十五元、入後漲勢稍殺、鹽税以後、尙略小一二角、次盤祗編遣裁兵略小三四角、此後則仍轉漲風、市上需要紛起、各債市復漲二三角至七八角、午後開盤、七十五號補空尤湧、十六號空頭掉期、漲風仍盛、祗鹽税等略見平定、餘又漲數角至一元有零、收盤時已六時後、交易依然頗爲踴躍、四十六號賣出愈見勇猛、但進户毫不示弱、各債市祗中間二三種稍稍平穩、餘則仍係漲勢、鹽税以後、又好三四五角不等、全日趨勢、一則以空頭急於抵補、一則以空掉期甚多、故四十六號雖有鉅額售出、檯面上不受影響、各倆債存賬數總額、尙有四千數百萬、前途傾軋之風正多、雙方壁壘、全恃時局之扶助矣、市價結果、裁兵續漲一元六七角爲最多、餘亦漲數角至一元四五角、成交總數、約共三千五百萬元左右、</p>

<p>紗花</p>
<h3>標紗得標花之助</h3>
<p>頓見回漲</p>
<p>紗市又回漲、形勢尙平、報載時局有良好消息、而原棉步步上升、致紗市帶起、且實需零星交易、尙不間斷、大量的銷塲仍缺、皆受金融枯涸影響、因此紗市漲風較棉市爲弱、根本上須依現銷爲伸縮、</p>
<h3>人標回好一元六一</h3>
<p>人標前市開盤、市氣尙平、拍至二三盤、棉市升高、紗市帶起、買風較濃、各月漲七·九角至一元三角、午後市况仍挺、近漲七·九角、遠漲一·三角、全日成交統計一萬六千一百包、查賣出同孚四百包、吉豐七百包、椿記一千一百包、源大九百五十包、愼記四百包、大昶五百五十包、昶記五百包、買進森康一千二百五十包、仁豐一千四百五十包、愼記七百包、通記四百包、義餘七百包、永大三百包、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>棉花漲風再接再厲</h3>
<p>空頭翻多：頻現新高峯</p>
<p>棉市漲風愈演愈熾、且步步發現新高峯、以美棉續漲、人心堅挺、而有一部份由空額翻多、故市氣漲勢尤激烈、但紗銷未見十分暢逹、廠需未能有大量的活動、近日之漲風未免太速耳、</p>
<h3>鄭標步漲八角半</h3>
<p>鄭標前市開盤、美棉又漲、買風仍熾、盤盤上升、各月漲五角至五角半、午後形勢依然緊俏、各月又漲一角至三角半、全日成交統計十六萬零九百擔、查賣出昌記三千擔、穗隆五千擔、源大八千四百擔、遠大四千九百擔、愼記二千八百擔、大昶五千七百擔、源興昌四千六百擔、同孚二千擔、同和三千二百擔、買進昶記三千三百擔、森康五千一百擔、仁豐四千擔、信誠七千一百擔、椿記四千八百擔、大豐七千擔、大昌成七千四百擔、德記四千四百擔、收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>粉市人心興奮逾常</p>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、均呈良好之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥又好四五角左右、坎拿大好二角左右、兼以本月份廠家籌碼、逐步收束、人心方面、不免顧及、所以開盤以後、近遠人心、均見堅俏、交易亦大見暢、迨至下午開盤、各月份市面、均又步佳、廠家亦續收本月份、較上午又好一分外、後則天津帮臨時多頭、趁高回出、一部份廠家、亦套出遠期、市氣略爲抑住、不過市塲人心、頗呈熱奮、後步或須再振也、結果本月份較前日漲三分、二月份漲二分七釐半、三月份漲二分半、四月份漲二分二釐半、五月份漲二分、六月份漲二分半、</p>
<h3>期麥回好五分</h3>
<p>午後交易甚寂一至五月空拍不開</p>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤後、各月份已穩固、以洋麥報價回漲二角至四五角不等、且以洋麥雖在旺卸、惟從事套出者實在少數、因此人心轉穩、開價卽好、一二三月份均好五分、惟交易甚寂、了無神采、下午各盤、一月至五月份均空拍不開、祇六月份開出一價、無甚上落、至現麥市况、尙見活絡、開瑶灣麥四元、蕪湖麥三元六角、計三</p>
<p>千包、由福新辦去云、</p>
<h3>晚稻轉定厚粳續跌</h3>
<p>（滬南）各帮來源似乎轉稀、祗到二十餘號、（三千餘石）然以日來去路滯澀、浦積已厚、計約二百餘號、（其中都有已售脫未斛去者）是其人心頗餒、市况遂難轉機、如常帮蘇同帮南港等厚粳、城鄉店胃都呈觀望、銷化呆而勉强、售方祗有跌價脫售、行情遂再落角許、杜洋尖至是雖胃動動、剩貨無多、昨市天津威海衛等帮續辦旣有近二千包、市况似能站定、陰變元時令關係、終是獨呈秀色、惟中次者平平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各路來源五十餘號、市上各種去胃仍屬呆滯、市形白粳羊杜埠尖早薄稻價小近角、變陰元客尖平疲、</p>
<h3>客秈祇本街略有交易</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、昨閩帮以該省形勢混亂、不敢暢行辦裝、他帮亦多觀望、粤帮新由長江各省辦到大批、更無意問津、故人心卽見趨軟、是以售開機油米又小一角、他米均居平軟、統市祇由本街應酬機油三百念六包、價六元八角六分至六元七角、又砶靖一百包、價五元九角、江西機元五十包、價七元三角半、後形均看平疲、倘得本客再有暢胃、方可轉機也、</p>
<h3>閘北貨</h3>
<p>金菜木耳瓜子轉漲</p>
<p>北貨自閩變以來、因受滯銷影響、大部份貨品均見降落、茲聞閩局有結束之說、故專销閩粤之主要貨品、如金針菜·木耳·瓜子等、昨均轉漲苟時局平定實現、則後市勢必續漲無疑、（昨報興化圓佔五分之一、係五分之四之誤、特此更正</p>
<h3>疋頭　呢絨衣着舖生意大忙</h3>
<p>邇來天氣漸轉寒冷、呢絨衣着舖生意驟見增繁、厚呢大衣現定者更盛、本埠霞飛路·小西門·棋盤街·大新街·四川路·吳淞路·南京路一帶西服男衣着舖、連日均有大批大衣交易、其中以點花西裝大衣、及五彩中裝大衣爲最暢銷、毎件價格在三十元左右者較爲普及、四馬路小花園一帶時裝女色衣着店、大衣生意亦視前爲激增寳逹利元平呢面子、洋狐皮領者、毎雙售洋二十五六元、銷路比他種貨色爲廣大、但呢絨拆貨躉批交易極形寥落、蓋衣着帮正在推銷前進之存貨、尙無再進新貨之意、故呢絨公會市氣、依然淸淡如前、各貨價俱無上升之望也、</p>
<p>五金</p>
<h3>平扎馬口鐵到銷兩旺</h3>
<p>平扎馬口鐵、近來到貨十分踴躍、故積存在棋昌棧分和祥諸碼頭、共有四千餘扎之多、惟出路方面、因馬口鐵店購胃甚强、故連日開出爲數逹二三千扎之多、其價頭號貨毎箱（卽二百磅計算）售二十四元、二號二十二元、三號二十元、四號十八元五角、比之先前雖未見進步、然一種良好氣象、殊非其他馬口鐵所能望及、</p>
<h3>英鋼板出路衰落</h3>
<p>英鋼板近來出路衰落、蓋客帮已呈停頓狀態、廠家進胃不多、交易異常蕭條、行情二厘半能售十元○二角半、半分九元、七厘半七元九角半、一分七元八角、</p>
<h3>絲茶　中外絲市同病相憐</h3>
<p>（海外日絲極度疲滯）日本去歲蠶繭豐收、絲産激增、積極發展海外絲銷、日絲在歐美市塲廉價傾銷、無如絲織品滯銷、紐約里昻各絲織廠生絲銷用大减、獻歲以來、日絲外銷極度疲滯、橫濱普通現絲價已跌破五百元（華幣）關、美法英各市塲日絲開價均祇扯華幣四百四五十元、且均有行無市、</p>
<p>（絲廠長吐綢銷漸起）内地各綢廠現均開織春綢、絲廠長吐綢門銷胃漸起、獻歲後杭湖兩屬綢商白長吐已購進一百四二五十擔、現正分批裝出、以應織造毛葛錦綈之需、</p>
<p>（人造絲走銷均不弱）人造絲春銷發動、走銷不寂、新歲後長江及烟靑等埠人造絲均有裝去、（</p>
<p>卽香港方面昨克利扶倫號郵船又裝去數十箱、現市長安硤石帮亦購進ＥＡＫ·龍麟塔等牌四十箱、價自二百十八元七角半至二百十二元五角凈盤、</p>
<p>（歐美絲銷難望轉機）歐美絲織廠去歲營業不振、存貨堆積、今歲開工者祇及十之四五、且均减少機車、是以生絲銷用益减、手中存絲、足敷需求、獻歲後紐約里昻實銷紅盤均未開出、華絲無人問訊、滬埠去電殊鮮轉滬、歐美絲銷一時實無轉機之望、市氣沈靜、黃白灰各絲經均陷於停頓狀態、幾無交易可報、</p>
<h3>英倫紅茶存積豐厚</h3>
<p>據最近英倫傳來消息、一九三三年度茶業概况、上半期商家頗多獲利、下半期則因印錫荷蘭茶、産量激增、市價步跌、商家多受虧折、現下英倫市塲、最高莊之祁門紅茶、雖已完全售罄、然兩湖中低莊茶、尙有二三萬箱、仍在商家手中、印錫爪哇茶、囤積更有十五萬担之鉅、就此種情狀觀之、華茶對英贸易、低莊粗貨、形勢至爲不利、</p>

<h3>女人未必多說謊</h3>
<p>— 趙令儀</p>
<p>侍桁先生在「談說謊」裏，以爲說謊的原因之一是由於弱，那舉證的事實，是：「因此爲什麽女人講謊話要比男人來得多」。</p>
<p>那並不一定是謊話，可是也不一定是事實。我們確也常常從男人們的嘴裏，聽說是女人講話謊要比男人多，不過却也並無實證，也没有統計。叔本華先生痛駡女人，他死後，從他的書籍裏發見了醫梅毒的藥方；還有一位奥國的靑年學者，我忘記了他的姓氏，做了一大本書，說女人和謊話是分不開的，然而他後來自殺了。我恐怕他自已正有神經病。</p>
<p>我想，與其說「女人講謊話要比男人來得多」，不如說「女人被人指爲『講謊話要比男人來得多』的時候來得多」但是，數目字的統計自然也没有。</p>
<p>譬如罷，關於楊妃，祿山之亂以後的文人就都撒着大謊，玄宗逍遥事外，倒說是許多壞事情都由她，敢說「不聞夏殷衰，中自誅褒妲」的有幾個。就是妲已，褒姒，也還不是一様的事？女人的替自已和男人伏罪，眞是太長遠了。</p>
<p>今年是「婦女國貨年」，振興國貨，也從婦女始。不久，是就要挨駡的，因爲國貨也未必因此有起色，然而一提倡，一責駡，男人們的責任也盡了。</p>
<p>記者某男士有爲某女士鳴不平的詩道：「君王城上堅降旗，妾在深宮那得知？二十萬人齊解甲，更無一個是男兒！」快哉快哉！</p>
<h3>鼻烟</h3>
<p>— KS</p>
<p>讀過周作人先生的「笑話選」的，大概都覺得這位倡中庸論的先生，以文章處世的本領越發精明了。正當咱們裏裏外外拚死拚活的時際，周先生有這種調度苦難的法術，呌我們在失望之中連聲打着哈哈，這不能不說是一種「無量的功德」。</p>
<p>有人時常訝異周先生爲什麽會出這様一本書，這様大驚小怪，實在不値一辯。凡屬亂世春秋，如戰國時九流的末流，南北朝的說狐道鬼，諧乘雜載，都是當時文人在無可如何的局面下擺下的疑陣。說它是消極，又含着樂天的心理，說它是樂天，却又完全是不恭的玩世。不過周先生却没有到廢名君的地步，居然能撰一部莫須有先生傳：周先生倒底要擺擺敎授的面孔，他却决不會出一本「笑話撰」。</p>
<p>說到廢名君的莫須有先生傳，彷彿記得某刋物上有過梁秉憲君的一篇短文，在北平的銷路非常旺盛，某大學文科的學生，差不多「人手一篇」。它會有這様的出路，依我想，一則是周先生那偉大的提拔力（見莫須有先生傳序），一則在那「嚴格的」北平社會生活下，太辣太鹹的料子來不得，於是廢名君給他們擦一把鼻烟，開一個文學史上的特例，這也許是周先生所認爲該大加稱讚的吧。</p>
<p>莫須有先生傳不但是一壼鼻烟，那文章的拉雜，簡直該打尼股一百。逹人雅士看了會莞爾笑了起來，正因爲廢名君不是做不出好文章，却是他會撒嬌，會「撇紐」。會「撇紐」的人，大概也可算做士氣，至少是要比那些情哥情姐討來得高出一頭。但這年下兒，也不是没有辦法，廢名君來的也太過份，至於周先生的捧塲也不見得就不是走的岔路兒。可憐的是我們的買書人，掏幾毛錢出來聞一把鼻烟，有些不値得。</p>
<p>聽說周先生喜歡會裝傻的人，而我們的廢名君居然學會了裝傻，所以有了這麽一着；但我總以爲中國不是毫無辦法，我們的文壇也不是就從此會譚玄說鬼，這種勁，希望他倆收回一下才好。</p>
<h3>說謊與湖南人的笨</h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>湖南有一句俗語，『哄死人不犯罪』，含有說謊騙人不算罪過的意思。其實湖南人頂笨，說謊騙人的会倆並不高明。就拿此較近一點的歷史來說罷。</p>
<p>洪楊之役，滿淸政府快要坍臺了，當時『勤王』的口號雖然是由統兵大將，封疆大帥呌出來的，可是實在担負了所謂『勤王』的責任的人，却是湖南幾個初無言責，無官守的書憨子。他們拿了『勤王』的空口號，自命所謂『忠義之士』，就幹，幹，幹，更幹，實幹，快幹，不顧一切地大幹起來。『紥更寨，打死仗』，是他們幹的方略，『拙』『誠』兩個字是他們幹的精神。本來所謂『勤王』，只是當時庸懦無能的將帥呌呌騙人的口號，湖南人却認眞起來，没有兵權在手，就練圑勇也完成了所謂『勤王』的大功。功成以後，於湖南人有什麽好處呢？於中國民族有什麽好處呢？他們是不曾想到的，結果，少數人成了忠臣義士，大多數人上了所謂忠臣義士的大當！至今長江下游各省還留下不少當年流落的湘軍的子孫！『洪死人不犯罪』，要是不錯的話，滿淸政府拿君臣之義一類的話騙了曾左一流人物，曾左一流人物又拿這類的話騙了他們的部下，誰說不該呢！而且當時有誰覺得聽了謊話，受了大騙呢？幸而不死的，散伍流落，受盡人間生活的苦辛；不幸而死的，入祀所謂湘軍昭忠祠，也只賺得『拙』『誠』兩個的考語。這兩個字是曾國藩一篇湘軍昭忠祠記裏的話。笨拙，誠實，確是湖南人的精神！曾老先生已經老實告訴人了。</p>
<p>洪楊之役以後，中國政局上毎一次大變動，湖南人就有機會表現出他笨拙誠實的眞精神。多的不便說，僅說一件罷。戊戍維新運動，康梁是主要人物，禍變一來，康梁聞風就逃了，譚嗣同却不肯逃，說是改革政治没有不流血的，流血請從他開始，他不知道維新變法原是當時所謂志士以及政府官僚騙人的口號　　總之，僅就政治來說，七八十年來，中國毎一次政治上的大變動，無論正面反面，怎様說謊，湖南人總是把牠認眞的，結果，充分表現了湖南人的笨！</p>
<h3>跣足的人（外四篇）</h3>
<p>— 繆崇羣</p>
<p>跣足的人，肩上有着重担，足下踏着石子磷磷的路。不躑躅，不喘吁；三步倒有兩聲吆喊，是『力』的節奏，是『生』生</p>
<p>的高歌。</p>
<p>血汗</p>
<p>用廢膠輪改製的鞋片，洞穿了，便再打上一個補綻，這並不是『工欲善其事，必先利其器』的意思，一個作爲肉的馬逹的勞働者，他一生的血汗，也就是馬逹裏面所需要的柴油和軋士林了。</p>
<p>新車</p>
<p>就是一九九九年式最新的汽車，恐怕和兩千年前的棺材様子也差不很多的。把行屍走肉來諷剌世上無用的廢人，古已有之；可是現今坐在機子裏飛東到西，躺在棺材裏也能橫衝直撞的事，這不能不說是以前所無的。</p>
<p>廢人被諷剌的語句是落了伍，而廢人在享受上實際是得着長足的進展了。</p>
<p>招牌</p>
<p>街西邊一家舊藥店的招牌『高黏除，』臨街的窗子上寫着：『本號只此一家，並無子孫在外。』可是街東邊就有一家膏藥店，他的招牌呌『老黏除，』臨街的窗子上没有什麽字。</p>
<p>這没有字的廣告，我以爲是勝過了那有字的了。</p>
<p>記得上海賣醬肉的陸稿薦，北京賣剪刀的王麻子，雖然同在一條街上有七八家，可是他們毎個招牌上都加着『眞正』兩個字。呌顧主都相信他們是眞正的，那或許不可能，反之，因爲都是『眞正』却懷疑着他們都是虚僞的了。</p>
<p>假如招牌廣告不帶着揚已貶的性質，那便失掉了他的作用；但街西邊那家膏藥店的老闆本來也是想取巧的，結果反駡了自已。</p>
<p>不過，這年頭的傻子畢竟少多了，招牌廣告其實都是多餘，能够魚目混珠便得了。</p>
<p>哀｜賀｜</p>
<p>傍晚的時候，聽見巷裏有很多人的沉重的脚步聲，並且一起的喊着：哀｜賀｜哀｜賀｜像是抬着什麽笨重的東西。｜不知那里又死了人。妻說。</p>
<p>｜怎麽？</p>
<p>｜抬棺材的。</p>
<p>我常常想，死是一件超脫了的事，可是要睡在那麽一個笨重的棺材裏，却覺得多事了。耐不住地便囑咐着妻：</p>
<p>｜我死了可不要張羅棺材，裸葬頂好　　：：：：：：：：：</p>
<p>聽着哀｜賀｜哀｜賀｜的聲音去遠了妻並没有說什麽。</p>
<p>｜抬煤的，挑糞的，走起路來都是喊着哀｜賀｜人死了想必也是一筆貨。</p>
<p>｜不，剛纔那是抬的空的棺材。</p>
<p>後來在街上遇着出殯的，注意到那杠夫沉默地並不喊着什麽。棺是够重的，裏面還加了一個人：：：</p>
<p>死，是相當的有它本身的嚴肅罷？不過我想，就是那麽喊着也好；他們喊的是『哀，』同時接着的便是『賀，』一個人的兩面意義都好像有了。</p>
<h3>趣喩　（續）</h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>㈤</p>
<p>程正揆復何省齋索題石公畫菜芋一扎，所用妙喩獨多，且無一不令人解頣，可謂趣喩中之佳搆。其文云：「石公不向鐘樓上念讚，却要床脚下種菜。大似磕睡漢思量捉虱子咬。吾兄見境生情，忍耐不禁，忽地迸出本地風光，片時解脫。不好機緣，祗累及不相干人硬差判斷，無謂，無謂」。這趣喩可謂「佛化的」。</p>
<p>㈥</p>
<p>徐芳答黃石菴云：「來敎諷繹數過，酸風凄雨，颯然而集。不但披示所及，卽諸未及，亦能以意會之。嗟呼！吾輩於今，固天地間一種苦物，如蔬薺果匏草茶木蘖之類，賦質已定，不可如何者也」。「諷繹」二字用得已妙，復喩以「酸風凄雨，颯然而集」，不僅使文姿更優，情感的分量也特殊的加重，何况還有「以意會之」？「苦物」以下，喩得更是適當之至。我說，「苦物」豈僅徐芳，生於數百年後之我輩，何一又非「苦物」乎？透過此書看當時，眞不禁感慨系之矣。</p>
<p>㈦</p>
<p>徐芳還有一封給張武仲的认，譬喩得也非常之妙，與上文頗有互發的地方：「今天下肥皮厚肉之人不少，而吾輩一二兄弟，受骨偏瘠。武仲之窮，旣不能保微肉於鷺鶿脚上，而弟之拙復欲削餘金於子午針頭，可笑亦可悼矣。」照這様看來，吾輩不但跟他做「苦物」，且要跟他做「鷺鶿脚」，雖没有肉，也是要被吃的，奈何，奈何！</p>
<h3>兩兄弟　㈧㈢</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>這已不是一種精神的，使人煩惱的痛苦，這却是一種没有藏身處的畜牲的癲狂，一種將被雨，風，暴風雨和世間一切猛务侵襲的，無家可歸的流浪者的物質的憂慮。在登上這郵船時，在鑽進這在波濤上摇蕩着的小房間時，那從來睡在一只固定的安寗的床上的肉身便對於未來的不安全反抗起來。至今爲止，這肉身是覺着受到陷在地下且被地吸牢的堅固的墻壁，和睡在能够禦風的屋頂下的同一地方的確信的保障。現在呢，我們在緊閉的溫暖的住所中所喜歡嘗試的一切都變成了一種危險，一種永恒的苦痛。</p>
<p>脚底下再没有陸地了，有的却是那流動的，怒鳴的，呑滅人物的海。身邊再没有可以散步，奔跑，使人迷路的塲所了，有的却是若干米突的木板，使人像一個罪犯夾在别的囚人中一様在那上面走着。再没有樹木，庭園，街道，房屋，而祇有着水和雲。並且他將不絶地覺到這大船在他的脚下動蕩。遇着有暴風雨的時候，他使得靠住板壁，拉着門屏，抓住仄狹的舖</p>
<p>位的邊沿，免得滚在地上。没有風浪的日子，他便會聽到推進機的響朗的顫動，並感覺這載了他的船在奔逝，一種不停的，有規則的使人激怒的奔逝。</p>
<p>而他之所以被判定去過這種流浪的徒刑犯的生活，却祇是因爲他的母親曾委身於一個男子的愛撫。</p>
<p>他往前走，他現在被那離去祖國的人們所通有的愴懷的哀愁弄得懦弱無力了。</p>
<p>他心裏再不感覺有這種傲然的輕侮，這種對於身邊走過的不相識者的意存輕視的仇恨，他有的却是一種想要和他們說話，告訴他們他將離去法國，使人聽他說話並安慰他的寂寞的願望。他心裏有的是一種向人伸手的可憐虫的羞人的需要，一種要覺得有人因他離去而悲傷的靦覥而又堅强的需要</p>
<p>他想起了瑪洛斯科。祇有這老波蘭人深切的愛他，能感着一種眞的痛心的情緖；於是醫生决定去看他。</p>
<p>當他走進小店時，那正在一個大理石的臼裏搗着一些藥粉的藥劑師，稍稍驚慄了一下，放下了他的工作。</p>
<p>「你簡直不出來了嗎？」他說。</p>
<p>靑年解釋他曾有過許多請託奔走的事要幹，却不曾說明那些請託奔走的動機，他坐下問道　　「那麽，生意好啦？」</p>
<p>生意是不行的。同行競爭得非常厲害，在這工人區域裏病人是少而且窮。在這地方祇能出賣一些廉價的藥劑；這裏的醫生是絶不開出那種稀少且複雜的，可以使人賺到五倍利息的藥劑的。這老實漢子的結論是：</p>
<p>「如果這情形再繼續三個月的話，那祗有關門之一法。假使我不指望着你時，我的好醫生，我早已去擦皮鞋去了。」</p>
<p>筆爾覺得心裏非常難過，突然决定給他那致命的一擊，因爲這是免不了的：</p>
<p>」啊！我：：我：：我再不能給你任何帮助了。我下月初便會離開哈佛爾。」</p>
<p>瑪洛斯科驚駭非常，取下了他的眼鏡說：</p>
<p>「你：：你：：你說什麽？」</p>
<p>「我說我會要走，我可憐的朋友。」</p>
<p>這老頭子簡直目瞪口呆，半響說不出話來，他覺得他最後的希望也崩解了，於是他突然對他所追隨的，他所喜歡的，他那様信任他而他却這様把他抛棄了的人，發生了反感。</p>
<p>他吃吃地說：</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「望帝魂」</h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>在民國政治史上，兼具「謬種」與「禍胎」之特徵的，當然應該推溥儀先生。現在，聽說這隻寳貝又要做「皇帝」了，區區義不「頌聖」，但是却要」論」牠一下。。</p>
<p>辛亥革命，本來就是一個「月份不足」的「流産」，所謂「民國」，那時實在是一個換湯不換藥的「老店新開」。袁世凱是壞在他自已也要一過「南面」之癮，不得不用四百萬民脂民膏的「優待」年金來呌溥儀先生休息幾年。否則老袁要是像曾國藩一様爲民族敵人「鞠躬盡瘁」的話，那落日古城的北京，多半不會在二十三年前就遇到「王氣黯收」之厄運的。所以袁慰廷後來以民國元首的資格，還是用奏摺「恭祝聖壽」，而且表示：「僅留尊號，至今耿耿」！蓋於太不客氣之中，還夾有三分「隱痛」也。</p>
<p>那經過「革命」而仍舊保存的禍根，一直讓牠在北京那個「大城圈内面一個小城圈」裏逍遥着｜｜娶妻納妾，斷袖分桃，閙得穢德彰聞。</p>
<p>張大辮子和「康聖人」首先轉溥儀的念頭，因而閙了民六復辟的一幕。木屐朋友始終是和呂不韋之於王孫異人一様，看定了溥儀是「此奇貨可居」，從民初以後，一直嘘寒送煖，饋問不絶。此外，不特那些「老而不死」的遺老們非靠定了溥儀吃飯不可，竟在民國首都的新華門内，經常閙着「南書房」，「上値」，「朝覲」等沐猴而冠的把戲，就是我們的名流胡ＸＸ，也還去呌過幾聲「皇上」，「社會主義大師」Ｘ博士，更恭維溥儀，說是「遜帝英明，前途有望」！這些事實</p>
<p>，都是表示着中國政治之養癰遺患的特點和若干人竟在有意無意之間，實行那煽撥殘灰，自取煖意的工作。</p>
<p>馮煥章先生在民國舞台之上，本不失爲一個快人，可惜不澈底，當他倒戈回師，趕走曹琨，附及溥儀的時候，竟在天橋解决李彦靑的那一會兒，多吝惜了一顆子彈，還是讓鄭孝胥之徒，把那禍苗搬到天津，等於替木屐朋友留下一個最合式的傀儡。弄到現在，那禍苗一變而爲「滿洲國執政」，且將再變而爲「滿洲國」（或「滿蒙國」，或「中和國」，或「囗囗國」？）的「皇上」了。</p>
<p>溥儀做「執政」，本來世人皆知其爲唱「提綫京戲」。現在，又由「執政」高陞而爲「陛下」，其政治生機將更削弱而成爲一個不拆不扣的「木仍伊」！遥想櫻花初放，溥儀或將到東京去演一齣「雙包案」，接着，「行都」將設熱河，實行向蒙古，綏察和長城以南蠶食侵呑。我們根據過去「要甚麽就給甚麽」的「諸葛大計」計</p>
<p>以推測未來，還不是讓木屐朋友去「呑」而已，</p>
<p>溥儀稱帝，不過是日本侵略中國之長鎖練中的一環，繼續抖開的，還有許多慾望無窮的新花様。結果，是中國被宰割之更加深刻和遠東戰爭的爆發。中日兩民族問題的正式淸算，就在中國平民的大多數覺醒，挺而自衛的時候。　　至於溥儀的個人，却是絶不關重輕，「日滿經濟計劃」全部完成以後，那一隻「木乃伊」必然會監在東京，過「安樂公」的生活，直至於死。</p>
<p>記得民國初年，浙督朱琛拼命屠殺革命黨人以換取洪憲朝廷的爵賞，結果，還是新華夢醒，一瞑不視。有一位幽默先生聯以輓之曰：「閨中悔作封侯夢，海上空歸望帝魂」！現在的溥儀，也就是因爲遺老國賊們之作「封侯夢」的太多，結果就不惜把溥儀這個除了荒淫而外，别無所知的混小子，送給日本作現在的「木乃伊」和將來的異鄉鬼。歷史和人事，七顚八凑，判定了溥儀先生之「之猶望君王化杜鵑」的命運，還說甚麽？</p>
<h3>戀愛與身份</h3>
<p>— 丁丁</p>
<p>今天珊來看我，說起她們校裏發生了一件師生戀愛的事情，現在學校當局正在加以調查和不准許的時期中。又說一方面在派别的女生勸導這位被纞愛着的女學生。「呵！你們學校裏不是祇有小學的嗎？小學裏的女生和男敎師鬧起戀愛的把戲來了，那是有些滑稽了。」我聽了珊的話，不禁呌了起來。過後我就想：</p>
<p>愛是人類的本能，也是天賦的特權。人類當有愛人的自由權。但是小學裏的學生，知識學問尙在萌芽時期，她能懂得什麽選擇？但談了戀愛而妨礙自已的學業以至蹉跎了求學年齡，這是無疑而又是何等可惜的一回事。同時在另一方面，戀愛至上主義，那我們是絶對不敢相信，因爲這明明是欺騙人的笑話，所以，應該想到的，當個小學敎員的人是否能够供給家庭而有餘？（這裏需要申明的，就是我并不是在譏笑當小學敎員一定就不能擔負家庭經濟的責任。女子固然應該放棄向來依賴男子的劣根性，而起來共同負荷家庭的經濟，但在今日的社會裏，還是不可能。雖然談了戀愛可以不必需要在物質方面去求怎様地享樂。但是至少總得要使生活不形於破産，因爲我不相信談了戀愛後能束緊肚子的。以現在一般小學敎師的待遇說，他們自已眞是差不多是在餓着肚子在講臺上亂喊，他們有力量去擔負家庭嗎？</p>
<p>然而事實上，有這位小學敎師在戀愛着他的一個小學生了。在這一戀愛之中，必定是存在一個有趣的聯繫，換句話說：一個窮得像個光蛋的小學敎師，何以會値得逗引一個知識才開的小學生的愛戀？這個聯繫，就是「身份」。</p>
<p>在買賣式的父母之命，媒灼之言的婚姻下，所謂身份，是以「門相户對」是唯一的主要條件，名家望族的女兒，非「門相户對」者勿嫁。同様的，飛黃騰逹的後裔，又非「門相户對」者勿娶矣。近來摩登少爺和小姐，對於身份，在無形中也定下了這様的規定：出洋回來的女士非省長部長會長Ｘ長則不嫁，大學畢業過的女士非嫁留學生不可，高中畢業的定要嫁個大學生才爲快事，高小初中的女士們能够嫁給她們的敎師，那自然是够她們心花怒放了。</p>
<p>男子們自然也有同様的要求。</p>
<p>呵！戀愛與身份，原來已有了這様密切的關係哩！</p>

<p>｜大年初一的讀報剳記｜</p>
<p>新年過去了，却總還放不下一條心，爲的是一九三四的新年，來得格外熱閙，而我竟懶得没曾留下半點痛跡，這，對於民族國家，誠有負「歌頌」之缺如，愧煞了是二十多歲的一位高大漢子的國民，所以總想絞盡腦汁來寫一鐘點，却又時光像電閃般的駛過了九大天，腦海裏仍祇有一幅「想寫」的企圖。不得了，再拖延下去，新年的獨一着就成了幻影，以後甚麽都不要空談了，日記也就抄它一頁吧。</p>

<h3>妻之欲</h3>
<p>— 士　�Z]現代名人書畫  張叔通别字垢佛松江人本刋主編我的女友斷鴻零雁之二  蔚大ＸＸ：　　太陽乏力地褂在西邊屋頂上，已是黃昏時候。我昏昏然被擁擠着推出巴黎大戲院的石級；一陣寒風迎面而來，我打了個寒噤，我很後悔犠牲了我難得的假日，而所得的結果正和我娛樂的初意相反。爲了要吃飯，找工作的而且是那様努力，簡直使我没有喘息的時候，今天意外的收穫了一天假期，我滿懷思忖着要怎様並不浪費的化去這一天。首先翻開今天的報紙，這本來是我每天的工作，今天却儘翻了兩張戲報，就被一幅巨大的廣告誘惑了我，那是巴黎大戲院開演的離恨天。我欣欣然獨自向霞飛路走來，半載没有親近她，舊地重臨，分外覺得親切；不過那許多似曾相識的市招被雨打風吹而黯然無光了的路旁的小樹也悄悄地飄着黃葉，不再我們會面時那般的迎風招展。僅是六個月的隔别，已景物全非，何怪我們萬物之靈的人類底境遇更是不可預測了？然而我的心被離恨天牽引着的我依然輕快的慢步向西，終於逹到了同様闊别了半年的娛樂塲所。我擠進了人羣，和六個月以前一様，在售票櫃中我買了一張｜｜張樓下的座券。那個收票的孩子，穿着皇家制服的，ＸＸ，就是你說過很討人喜歡的那個孩子，他似乎認識我，或者爲了我身旁没有熟識的伴侶而他不敢向我打招呼。本來世界上面貎相同的很多｜你告訴過我，有一次你在法國公瞏内將一個不認識的少年誤認了我，因爲那少年有幾分面貎和我相同；其實你惦記着我老是坐在那個茅亭裏的，祇要那少年的背影和我没有多大區别，你恐怕就要認爲是我了。所以今天｜我痴想，假能你和被認爲我的少年同來，那個很討人喜歡的孩子定也將少年認爲我的。ＸＸ，多少又是廢話，現在你不樂意聽這套吧？　　我若無其事的踏進裏面，在那個我們時常佔據着的角落坐定了。今天是那様孤獨，我半年前的情况，正如火一般的夏天進展到肅殺的冬令，使人不敢回憶過去的甜蜜的夢：我更不敢抬起頭來估理毎對挚手進來的情侶。我不是嫉妒他們，也不是羨慕他們，我替他悲哀，或者六個月之後他將同様地和我一般跌進冰窖；雖然以他們的時間計算起來，半年以後正是火一般的夏天。　　ＸＸ，從前她電影，往往出門的時候甚至忘了影片的題名。今天，我想，可以將這哀感的離恨天從頭迄尾瞧個滿。電燃暗下來了，眼前是一片漆黑，我忘了在電影院内，我認爲踏進了黑暗的世界，我害怕起來的雙手捧住了眼睛，兩個鐘點不敢偸自張開。　　現在我被寒風吹醒了瞧見牆壁上男女主角擁抱接吻的姿勢，我後悔一個難得的假日這様虚投了，而六毛錢的代價也是白白犠牲｜說起來自已都不信，半年來我的性情變成那様嗇吝，從前甚至不能記起影片的題名，反而化上兩倍的代價的時候也覺得滿目然的。人類的變遷眞是不可預測啊！　　被人的潮擁出了一段路，人羣的脚步漸次差落下來，我孤零零的埋着頭向前走，自然没有來時的那般興趣了。在一個電車站旁，我無意間瞧見了一家美麗的窗飾，ＸＸ，在六個月以前，我們時常在那精緻的雅座裏嚼着冰不知時光已經夜深了的，現在明亮的霓紅燈下已是新開張的時裝公司了，不知那個胖胖的店主人還那般的笑顔逐開嗎？想起了他，我想起了我的女朋友，我們最後一次在這裏分手。她說她的天津的母親害着重病，她要歸去探望三年没有見過面　　的娘，我們是那様依依不捨的分手的；我淸楚地記着我最末的一句話是：「我們以後不知再有見面的機會？」我女友的回答是一個微笑，同時緊握了我的手掌。　　如今已相隔六個月了，還不見她回來，｜或者她已到了上海。我祝福她不要被魔鬼呑噬了她的處女的心，祝福她天津的母親永遠康健！　　歸來時，我彷彿遺失了我的心一様！ＸＸ，我後悔浪費了一個難得的假日，還白白犠牲了六毛錢，換得來的是一顆痛創的心！　　下次再談罷。ＸＸ，我祝福你像祝福我的女友一般！　一九三三末日於新聲小樓　　鳴謝茲承航空署情報科惠贈航空小叢書「斷臂隊長」兩册特此鳴謝小說獄中記（七）  車輪九日　　　　脚指上毎一個都微腫，紫紅色，像初期的凍瘡一様；夜裏有時候會麻，不大概這麻木病的初期現象。　　　　我很恐慌，因我從來没有生過此項病，絶不知道它將來會發展到何如，對於我的生命將加以何種危險的脅迫。在老犯人的嘴裏也探聽不出什麽，只一味的以「不要緊」「没有關係」這類的話來安慰我，得不到對於將來的保證。　　這病的延長已有四五個月了。我發現而注意到它的時候是在南監，那時我恐怖異常，好像我的生命已不能長久延續。雖則我對家庭想隱瞞一切所感受的痛苦，但我千方百計要求到一封掛號信把一切詳情都報告了他們，在烏妹把家庭所受的打擊告訴我後，我自已都疑惑爲什麽明明知道會有的結果我却無勇氣去避免這結果，而克服住那一瞬的衝動？　　犯人的心是多脆弱｜他想自已忍氣呑聲去接受一切苦痛而不爲想念着他的人所曉得，但在某一刹那又詳詳細細的全揭露了他想保守的秘密，並且有時加重了語氣去告訴人。犯人的心是多脆弱呀，　　但這心的脆弱是由於生命的脆弱，在獄中的生命是很少保障的。生命的脆弱還另有一個原因｜卽是由於運動太少，給養太壞。這是獄中的兩個惡魔，犯人們的惡魔｜在他們統治下的犯人都染到了病，腸胃病，麻木病，肺病，攤軟病，種種在優良些的環境裏所不會發生的病。　　父親因爲我的脚麻木所以拿來了一瓶虎骨木瓜酒，打報告給二科長請發下來，他批下說｜「治病另有藥品烟酒乃干本監禁例不准。」　　　確實，這種有十多個醫官的醫務所，有紅的綠的黃的粉末的藥，每一星期有二次規定時間並且規定人數的看病機會｜｜一般的自由人也没有同醫生醫藥這様的密切過，但同這密切反是一個糟糕狀態的證明。並且所密切的醫生醫藥又是糟糕透的。　　當我們被帶的班長帶到醫務所，一個個的走到醫桌面前｜｜「六百六十六」｜犯人先講了番號，醫官手疾寫着，沉默着，用兩隻人的眼睛看着我｜｜胸脹：：：頭：：：」犯人病情都還未講完，却是他的藥方先寫好並且交給了你他還沉默着，最多說一聲｜｜「去吃吃試，大概有效的。」在那藥方上百分之三十至五十是阿司匹靈小蘇打或金鷄納松｜｜這是可以治一切病的藥似乎是。　　二三十個人的病在這様的迅速的看察下幾分鐘最多不滿十分鐘全了結了。在外邊的醫生對一個人的時間他對付了二三十個犯人，這様高明的醫生。</p>

<p>美國電影競賽是慘酷失望的造因  羅開競賽勝利的女子　　終有慘敗的危險　　昨天的一篇文章，所說的都是各種電影選舉競賽所造成的失望的慘酷。最使人駭異的就是因此而失望的人，數目字上的可驚，（最近的一次競賽，爲了一個人的勝利，使六千八百餘人都失望了）。我們現在再談談勝利者一方面的情形。他們雖然一次勝利了，但是至終還恐怕要失敗，並且是失敗的多。最可怕的是這般人於競賽之中得了勝利，差不多將他們從他們舊有的生活中，連根拔了起來，使他們不能再種下去。於是乎這般人，一旦到了好萊塢之後，就成了好萊塢無業羣衆的一部分。他們情願在好萊塢餓死，而不情願回故鄉而生存了。他們到好萊塢之前，先使大家都知道他們已經一步登天而做明星去了，等到慘敗之後，他們因以前誇張得太大了，所以就無顔回故鄉見父母了。　　但是在製作家一方面，却又不能完全歸咎於他們。他們所發起的各種選舉競賽，差不多全是眞實的。他們並且耗費了多量的金錢，往往結果一無所得。而那些獲得勝利的女人，亦都由公司方面給與種種的便利，使其能入成功之門。但是這許多年以來，從有聲電影發明起，由選舉競賽而來的演員，没有一個可以算得是已經成功的。　　大家總以爲加入競賽，是到電影光榮的終南捷徑，但是事實上却又不然。而由舞台上銀幕，却已屢次證明是方便之門。最近派拉蒙公司爲尋覓Ａlicejnwonderland裏的Alioo在美國全國舉行了若干次的競賽。總有七千個人被選而上了鐘頭試騐，但是始終没有一個人稱職。最後還是在一個小戲院裏，尋到了一位呌却樂德亨麗（harlotteHenry）的女伶。她因爲有過鏡頭上的經騐，並且能做戲，所以一試就當選了。其他各公司，亦都有過這種同様的經騐。　　新進演員的上不上鏡頭，並不在相貎好，亦不在腦筋靈敏，而却是由於天才的。曾有一次有十個大學學生，在競賽中被選了咨送到好萊塢，但是他們都不能上鏡頭。他們在好萊塢耽擱了一年，亦不願意再回學校了。至今他們還有好萊塢做些零碎的苦工過日子。至於各處送到好萊塢去的美麗女子，更是不計其數。他們亦是一到好萊塢，就不肯回家了。他們大半在臨時演員隊裏混著。一年兩年之後，一頓飽，兩頓餓的，度著日子，昔時笑容，亦都消滅，靑春亦都逝去了，衣服亦都襤褸了。結果之慘酷，往往令人不敢深詰。由此可知聰明美貎的女子，反容易自誤。　　這理有兩個參加競賽女子的座右銘。一個是「全美國第一名」的女子露茜龍特（TucilleLund）所說的。她說：「我覺得我很榮幸，能够贏得一個成功的機會，但是我所贏得的，不過是個機會。其餘的還要看將來。」還有一個競賽勝利者說：「無論勝敗如何，切不可過河拆橋。要是你贏了，不要擲掉回程的車票。最好你告訴你的朋友，不過到好萊塢玩玩，不久就要回家的。這様，你將來到回家的時候，亦不至於覺得難爲情了。」影片談評評「天下父母心」  王非TheSilverCord　　美國片，大概都以戀愛做喜劇的題材，而悲劇的題材，却往往採取倫理的故事。　　在不久以前，我們曾經看到一張傑出的倫理片「慈母恨」。他是把母愛，戀愛，國家的愛，做一個計劃的錯綜，而結果，是國家觀念佔了首先勝利，男主角戰死歐洲。接着母親的怨恨，終被愛克服，而接媳婦孫兒同居。現在我們又看到這張「天下父母心」。　　「天下父母心」，只是寫母愛與戀愛的衝突。而國家的愛不與焉。眞是一個普遍現象，當一個男子結婚以後對於妻子的親密，往往超過對於父母。因此父母們對於辛苦撫養成人的孩子，一旦和自已疏遠，而和别人親密，是何等的不高興？雖則和他親密的是自已的媳婦。尤其是母親，她的怨恨，是更大的在中國社會中，我們就常常看到唆使兒子疎遠媳婦的老婦人，但是這種觀念的起源，是什麽呢？我們不能不說到家族制度了。家族制度的確立，是隔離人們和家族以外的人的關係的。而在家族中最親密的，當然是兒子，現在兒子旣然得到更親密的妻子，而母親却失了親密的兒子了。尤其是年老的寡婦，她的社會關係更少，一旦親密的兒子疎遠了她，她的感覺孤獨而悲哀自然是更深的了。假使眞正的打破了家族的制度，或則把社會上人與人的關係，更親密起來，這種現象自然會减少，或則消滅了的。　　人類是有感情的，人類是習慣於家族制度太久了，倫理影片，所以能够感動人，是在這些地方，而不正確的倫理影片的爲害，也在這些地方。在目前中國電影有傾向倫理影片發展的趨勢，這一點是不能不注意，賺太太們的眼涙，是没有多大意思的！　　因爲是倫理片，自然導演者也跟着内容走，所以這張影片的節奏，是比較慢，比較沉着；尤其是深思憂慮的場面。他的一切色彩都能够表現出這點來或者這就是優點罷！評「蠻荒遊記」  凌鶴　　　在小資本的條件之下，如欲做一部眞有成績的影片，確非易事。因此，小公司在這種種條件之下掙扎着，必須以全力求上進，否則必然的遭受着極慘酷的失敗。　　看了「蠻荒遊記」之後，對於快活林公司應當有極誠懇的勸告。　　我們絶對不忽視小資本製片的艱難，正因爲如此，必須脚踏實地的做去。譬如說，毌求佈景的華麗，多拍外景，他如服裝單純等等，都是省錢的方法。所以，不妨採取農村中現實的題材，以極忠實的態度，十分努力的使電影成爲實生活的描寫。這様，雖然是慘澹經營，却有其無限量的前途。　　再解釋得明白一點，電影必須成爲實生活的素描。只有比實生活更眞實的描寫，才能使眞實的觀衆發生實生活的聯繫，而對於作品有着眞實的情感。如此，雖然是比較簡陋的作品，仍然可以得着廣大的觀衆之竭誠擁護。　　這裏有一個先决問題，便是力求作品的眞實。譬如說，現在農村以至於都市的貧民窟裏，在這動亂的年頭，儘有着許多可歌可泣的故事，他們的生活便是悲劇。悲劇最能動人感情，已經極顯著的事實，何况我們也没有將悲劇寫成喜劇的必要。旣如此，簡陋的佈景，破爛的服裝，：：都吻合了小公司的經濟情形，而成爲最好的製片條件了。　　但是，快活林公司却和其他的小公司一様，放棄着極有利的的方法不去使用，而極力以取巧的方法攝製不通的蠻荒影片，使電影成爲自欺欺人的東西，使觀衆發生厭惡的感覺，這在營業上毫無發展，自不待方，更主要的是聲譽上的失敗。　　「蠻荒遊記」製作上的動機，完全是因着偷剪了幾段外國獸片面可笑的凑合成一個故事，乃是毫無疑問的了。這在製作態度上，已經爲人們所不直，何况來幾段胡亂的凑合，更不値識者一笑。所謂矮人國或黑人國，不是連小孩兒也欺騙不到的麽？這様，欲使人們發生生活上的實感，更是不會有的事了。至於内容上的幼稚不通的地方，我眞不想一一指出。　　好罷，關於「蠻荒遊記」的評價，也不用多說了。我要竭誠的奉勸快活林公司當局，不要以爲開放神怪影片是小公司的好機會，趕快覺悟罷，努力製造眞實的影片。金燄王人美結婚　　民國二十三年中國銀壇第一件可紀念的事情，便是一月一日一時金燄和王人美兩大明星的結婚。她們結婚的消息宣佈的固然顯着突然，其實，她們從　　　合作之後便走進愛的途中了。她們的結婚，因爲她們是中國影界有相當地位的人物，在一般人想像之中他們的這一個婚禮不定要怎様盛大，其實，他們結婚的那天晚上，只不過藉着聯華同人舉行新年同樂會的機會完成了這個結婚的典禮。因爲他們聲明不做煩瑣的婚禮和消耗，所以同人也不備禮物，只是毎人隨便購買一些食品凑在一起大家一吃。金燄和王人美也没有什麽禮服不禮服，只是穿了平常所穿的藍布長衫，而這位新娘子人美小姐依然是赤着兩條大腿。舉行婚禮的時候，没有什麽音樂，只是男女同人同聲　他們歌唱婚禮進行之曲，由孫瑜證婚，講了幾句有趣的話。這一個婚禮便算完成了。像這様的婚禮在平常人看來，或者要說是太以平凡，其實，靜心的想一想，她們的這一種結婚的儀式，確實是有它的不平凡的意義存在啊。幾位女明星的蒼桑  時春　　這許多好萊塢舊時都曾經負一時重大聲望的舊明星，也許還有許多人尙能夠記憶他們的名字。他們雖然是曾經顯赫一時的影界老前輩，但是終究已被人遺忘了。即使有人能記起，亦年華老去，不復能賣力了。因之這許多滿想歸來的舊明星們，心理上不免感受着一百二十分的愴痛。　　愛拉哈爾EllaHall，在十五年之前確爲好萊塢絶紅的一顆明星，她曾醉倒過不知多少影迷。當她嫁給了依茂萊約翰遜，（也是一個好萊塢紅過的人物），她暫時同影界脫離。到現在，她已有三個孩子。她想起了往日的榮耀，又惠臨了好萊塢，但是現在的好萊塢，早已不認識十五年以前的紅明星了。她到好萊塢之後，即比較細小的職務，亦難找尋，誰認識她是十五年前的舊明星呢？　　密爾德黛蕙絲MildredDavis她是羅克的妻子，在以前曾有極大的聲望，羅克的滑稽片中亦常見她的踪跡。現在亦已休息了六七年而重來了。她以前的聲名難響，於是她但由羅克的竭力設法，亦不過得到了一張專演妻子或者母親的小角色。那還是看了羅克的大面子呢！　　斐妲勃郎孫，她的名望在十年前亦不可謂小。但現在她在好萊塢謀事二年之久，終不能得一相當地位。克拉克小姐，她現在亦已改稱了哈雷惠琳遜夫人。她想要復職而不得。黛逹白拉，在十年之前是影場中的老怪物，現在已重新歸來了，但是她亦不能得一位置，她的丈夫是好萊塢的導演，然而對於他的妻子的地位却仍舊束手無策。這裏許多人對於婚姻都十分怨恨，她們以爲如果不結婚，他們的地位决不會遺失的。電影小說歌壇雙絶ＴheCatandtheFiddle(三）  墨塵　　道逹站住了聽着，祇聽見維克多瘋狂似的繼續說道：「我願放棄所有的音樂：：所有的藝術：：所有的成功：：去換取她的一笑。我可以不要一切的財富和榮名。那些算得了什麽？因爲我今天已經得到了戀愛！」道逹笑了。多少年他的心裏没有受到像那少年現在所覺得的東西了。不過昔時的戀望，他還有些記憶。少年和戀愛，是我末光榮的兩件東西！爲了女子的一笑，可以一切都放棄了。於是他對着維克多道：「你的歌呢？彈給我聽吧。」　　維克多彈着歌，但是至終，使道逹感到興趣的，並不是維克多的歌，倒是先莉的歌。却巧先莉來了。她到音樂院門口的時候，維克多還在彈着他的調子。道逹看見了先莉，連忙止住維克多道：「好了，好了，你的小歌劇，將來我可以排演的，但是你還要多加幾友歌曲，偉大的歌曲：：使全巴黎城都要哼哼的曲子！」然後他回過頭來，對着先莉道：「你呢？小姐，讓我聽聽你的歌。」他對她笑了，但是先莉慢慢地說道：「我是到貝蒂爾敎授這裏來學音樂的。她知道她將維克多的事情弄僵了，她的眼涙快要掉下來了。她明白要是她不來的話，道逹的眼光不會專注在她一個人身上的。這不過因爲她是一個女子，她心裏恨恨地想着，男人對於女子，總是這様痴心妄想的。　　可是維克多在旁邊勸道：「先莉：：你還是彈你的歌吧。」他們兩個人四目相對着，在那個時候，他們已各人心裏明白他們怎様的心心相印了。先莉笑了，她悟到誰先成功，誰後成功，都算不了一回事。他們可以做伴侶：：做愛人：：互相帮助着。而那個中年的戲院經理，現在正在和她做着眉眼，無妨利用他一下，做做成功之路上的橋梁。她说是坐下了，先彈了一個開頭，然後她曼聲的唱了起來，愛情在她的胸脯起伏着，使她的歌喉份外的柔媚。她本來是爲維克多唱者，但是道逹聽了，覺得心房像春天的樹葉一像在和風裏動蕩着。他的心已經有多少年，没有受女子的動蕩了。現在她的靑春，使他亦覺得年輕了。她的美貎，使他呼吸都停止了，在傾想着舊日甜蜜的貪戀。"Thenlghtwasmadeforlove"她看着維克多的眼睛，柔情脈脈地唱着。　“Thenightwasmadeforlove“她婉轉低回地唱着。那眞是不可　的事。不過多少時候，那支歌已經轟動了全巴黎，成了毎個人心中的戀歌了！不過多少時候，他們已經不能秘爲私有了，不過多少時候，它巴屬之於全界了。還有那金錢滚滚而來，掩蓋了先筣，也掩蓋了維克多。但是維克多總覺得那不是正當屬於他的。巴黎的華美公寓：：舶來的大汽車”：僕從們服侍得他様様稱心如意：：瓶裏放着奇異卉，盆裏盛着的鮮果品：：那不都是先莉的錢買的嗎！（未完）</p>

<h3>Situation Regarding the Takeover of Yuguan Is Intermittent</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Although efforts have been made recently to take over Yuguan, the Japanese side still lacks sincerity, resulting in an intermittent situation. Although the results of the previous negotiations between Tao Shangming and Chaisan were quite progressive, Ii Mai still holds a difficult attitude. The Japanese side's request that we must organize a relevant agency to handle everything regarding the takeover of the various passes of the Great Wall is being considered for feasibility. In addition, the points of turning Yuguan into a special municipality and establishing a special public security bureau after the takeover are all related to the political system, and it is feared that they cannot be handled accordingly. Tao Shangming is now in Tianjin conducting a meticulous study with Yu Xuezhong, and is scheduled to go to Yuguan around the 15th to continue negotiations. If the Japanese side can sincerely negotiate, the problem can be solved easily. (11th Central Telegram)</p>

<p>Japanese and Puppet Troops Implementing Anesthetic Policies in Eastern Chahar</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Renjie and Zhang Yunrong came to Beiping from Zhangjiakou yesterday to meet with Song Zheyuan and Qin Decun to report on the attempts of the Japanese and puppet troops to invade Chahar.

<p>(Beiping) A person from Chahar Province said that last year, the fierce fighting between the Tang and Liu troops in Chicheng and Yunzhou caused great damage to the area. Civilian homes were almost completely destroyed. Chicheng and Yunzhou have not yet reopened for business, and most of the people are living in thatched huts for the winter. The disaster situation in the area of Eastern Chahar is extremely serious. Liu's troops rebelled. Longmensuo in Chicheng is garrisoned by Song Tielin's brigade of Zhang Renjie's division. Dushikou is garrisoned by Zhang Yunrong. The local people hate Liu and Tang to the bone. After the second and fourth districts of Guyuan were occupied by the Japanese and puppet troops, they are now garrisoned by Li Shouxin and Zhang Jinghui's son, Zhang Sihe. Recently, an airfield is being built in the district. The highway from Duolun to Guyuan has been completed and is accessible to automobiles. East of the Heihe River is the regimental unit of the Japanese 8th Division. More than 30 Japanese troops are stationed at Xifengkou. Military camps and an airfield have also been built in Dagetown.

The airplane was piloted by An Lisen, the chief pilot of China National Aviation Corporation, and carried Huang Baoxian and Nie Kaiyi, two employees of the corporation. It departed from Hankou and was conducting a test flight of the Han-Yue-Dian-Chuan air route. When it flew between Longzhou and Yunnan's provincial capital, the weather was unusually bad. The pilot decided to land in Gaopang, north of Tokyo.

<h3>No Postal Service to the Northeast</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Postal Administration recently announced that the postal areas for which the sending of parcels, insured letters and remittances is suspended include the three northeastern provinces, but ordinary letters are not included. The outside world suspects that postal service has been restored to the Northeast. A person from the Ministry of Communications said that negotiations on restoring postal service to the Northeast have long been stopped. The Postal Administration announced the locations for which the sending of parcels, etc., is suspended because people often request the post office to send parcels and remittances to the Northeast and other bandit areas after postal service was blocked. Therefore, it was specially listed and published in the newspaper. Since insured letters cannot be sent to the Northeast, why can ordinary mail be sent exclusively? Furthermore, since the postal blockade of the Northeast, except for the Manchurian-Mongolian Railway area, which had previously established a postal exchange agreement and maintained normal postal service, all other areas have been blocked, and there has been no restoration of postal service.

<h3>New American Shipbuilding Proposal - Shu</h3>
<p>｜The Rising Tide in the Pacific｜</p>
<p>The United States, feeling uneasy about the Pacific situation, the threat to future new markets in the Far East, and the difficulty in defending the Philippines and Guam, has therefore planned to build new warships to supplement the number allowed by the Washington Treaty, in order to maintain the naval ratio of 5:5:3. In reality, apart from battleships where the United States is slightly superior to its hypothetical enemy in the Pacific, its remaining heavy and light cruisers, submarines, etc., although superficially equal to Britain in quantity, age, speed, and endurance, are actually inferior to Japan. In the event of a global crisis, the United States Navy must take into account the defenses of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. With its forces divided, its combat power will naturally be further weakened. Even if it remains neutral, it will still be difficult to maintain commercial transport and ensure freedom of navigation on the high seas. Moreover, in future world wars, the United States will inevitably be drawn into the vortex.</p>
<p>At the same time, the situation in the Far East is undergoing drastic changes at every moment. The establishment of the puppet state by Japan, the increasing tension between Japan and the Soviet Union, the progress of the East Asian Monroe Doctrine, and all other international changes are putting the United States in a difficult position. Its diplomacy with Japan is thorny. Looking back at the situation during the Washington Conference, the United States strongly advocated stopping the naval arms race, while Japan vigorously fought for its so-called "Eight-Eight Fleet" plan. If this plan had succeeded, even if Japan's naval strength had not immediately surpassed that of Britain and the United States, Japan would have dominated the Pacific. In order to ease the tense situation, the United States did not hesitate to sacrifice the construction of fortresses in the Philippines and Guam in exchange for the 5:5:3 ratio. It also agreed on the Nine-Power Treaty to maintain peace in the Far East. Who knew that this defensive diplomacy would only result in the destruction of the Nine-Power Treaty and the naval ratio becoming a dead letter? With the United States Navy in an inferior position, the hegemony in the Far East has inevitably been taken over by Japan. Furthermore, the tide of economic panic has repeatedly struck. Even the highly developed United States of America, with its advanced industries and agriculture, has been unable to avoid it, nor can it open up new markets to dispose of surplus goods. After nearly a year of actual struggle, the gains have been minimal. There has been no revitalization of industrial production, and agriculture has further declined. The so-called "Blue Eagle" revolutionary movement, the so-called low-priced gold standard, and other extraordinary economic measures have not been of much help in reality. Japan, as a late-developing industrial nation, is vigorously engaging in military adventures. Its industrial sector has been stimulated by this, and its military industry has made rapid progress. Japan's domestic economic situation relies on this for support. Whether this extraordinary method will lead to extraordinary disasters, and whether its people will become exhausted and degenerate due to excessive stimulation, it has no time to ask in this emergency, only needing to be excited for this period, and then slowly seek remedy. The United States, seeing this, is also using the construction of a large number of warships as a stimulant for the current decline of its industrial sector. The previously determined plan to build warships before this year is not enough to alleviate the current poverty, and thus a new naval shipbuilding proposal has emerged.</p>
<p>According to the outline of the proposal drafted by the U.S. Navy authorities, within the limits of the London Treaty, it involves approximately 102 warships, including 65 destroyers, one 8-inch gun cruiser, five 6-inch gun cruisers, one aircraft carrier (over 15,000 tons), and 30 submarines. From the next fiscal year to 1939, the total construction expenditure will be 516 million U.S. dollars. Over the next five years, an average of approximately 20 large and small warships will be built each year. In the coming year, 12 destroyers, one 8-inch gun cruiser, two 6-inch gun cruisers, six submarines, and two destroyer leaders will be built. What will be the impact of this huge shipbuilding proposal on the waves in the Pacific?</p>
<p>To establish a huge naval force, at least two main conditions must be met. First, there must be enormous economic strength. Second, the nation concerned must have a maritime mindset, be stimulated by overseas enterprises, and desire overseas development. Only then can a strong navy be established. Today's United States is already equipped with these two conditions. Japan only has the second condition. Its economic strength is extremely fragile. After the shipbuilding competition unfolds, I certainly know that Japan will inevitably be unable to sustain it.</p>

<h3>Six U.S. Navy Aircraft Make a Long-Distance Non-Stop Flight</h3>
<p>Took off from San Francisco the day before yesterday and headed for Honolulu</p>
<p>Distance of 2,098 Miles</p>
<p>President Roosevelt Sets June for Reviewing the Entire Fleet</p>
<p>Six U.S. Navy flying boats from San Francisco took off here today and headed for Hooloooloo [Honolulu], 2,098 miles away, hoping to reach Pearl Harbor by noon tomorrow. The six flying boats carry six officers and twenty-four sailors of all ranks, commanded by Navy Lieutenant Commander McChinnis. McChinnis and his men have been waiting here for several days for the weather to improve. If they can safely reach Pearl Harbor, it will be the longest-distance flight completed by the U.S. Navy's seaplane squadron. The six flying boats will not stop en route and will communicate radio messages with various locations on shore and ships at sea. (Reuters dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>Six US Navy aircraft led by Navy Lieutenant Commander McChinnis today departed from San Francisco for a long-distance non-stop flight to Honolulu. The first aircraft took off at 12:05 PM, followed by the remaining aircraft. By 2:18 PM, all six aircraft were in the sky. Each aircraft was heavily loaded with fuel, making the ascent difficult. Two auxiliary aircraft sped ahead on the water to break the surface tension, allowing the aircraft to take off. After the first aircraft took off, it circled around to wait for the remaining aircraft to ascend. Once all six aircraft were airborne, they formed a formation and flew past the Golden Gate Bridge, performing a farewell ceremony with downwind maneuvers. Within five minutes, they became tiny dots and disappeared towards Hawaii. Although this operation was planned for Thursday, the departure date was moved up a day because the weather bureau reported that a storm and a dangerous low-pressure area were brewing in the Pacific and would be blowing across the route from the north. Today, the first five miles are expected to have good weather, but it is feared that the aircraft will fly into severe storms near Hawaii. Authorities stated today that if the departure were delayed by 24 hours, the operation would likely be called off due to the poor weather forecast for the coming week. (National Telegram on the 10th)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's plan to review the Navy is currently under consideration by the government. According to today's news, the current tentative plan is to have the entire fleet gather off New York starting in the last week of May, and to prepare for the president to review it on the Hudson River in early June. The scale of this review will be unprecedented since Secretary of War Daniels of President Wilson's cabinet reviewed the American troops returning from the European War. All American battleships, destroyers, submarines, pursuit ships, auxiliary ships, seaplanes, and airships will be gathered and placed under the control of the Navy Department. Although detailed plans have not yet been announced, it is understood that the patrol fleets in the South China Sea and the Yangtze River, and the ships of the Asian fleet stationed in China and the Philippine Islands, will not be ordered to return to participate because they are currently on duty. According to naval figures here, President Roosevelt's review of the Navy was motivated by his concern for the Navy. Roosevelt served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in President Wilson's cabinet and has announced his intention to expand the U.S. Navy to the full extent allowed by the treaty. It is reported that there are now two large naval bills before Congress, one proposed by Vincent, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, which proposes building new ships to replace old ones, and the other proposed by Republican Representative Britten of the House, which proposes spending US$482 million to build 101 new ships.

<h3>Outline of Hirota's Diplomatic Speech to the Diet</h3>
<p>Japan Has a Special Position in the Far East</p>
<p>Inducing Mutual Cooperation Between China, Japan, and Manchukuo</p>
<p>Maintaining Coordination with the Powers</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota's diplomatic speech at the 65th Imperial Diet has had its draft prepared by the heads of departments within the ministry. Regarding the content of the speech, the foreign minister and the heads of departments have reached a consensus on the following two points: 1. Departing from the old pattern of previous foreign ministers only reporting on diplomatic progress and internal speeches, it is necessary to clarify the grand strategy of the Empire's future diplomacy to both domestic and foreign audiences. 2. The minds of people both domestically and abroad are being misled by the imminent approach of the 1935 naval conference, mistaking it for the so-called Second Washington Conference, which is causing various doubts. Efforts must be made to dispel this notion. It has been decided to take these two points as the guiding principles for the speech. The draft was prepared by Vice Minister Shigemitsu. It is reported that the points most strongly advocated by the foreign minister in his speech are as follows: 1. The Empire's special position in the Far East is a solemn historical and substantive fact. The Empire will adjust its relations with foreign countries based on this fundamental fact. 2. Since its establishment, "Manchukuo" has been an independent country with remarkable development and great prospects for the future. This fact cannot be denied by anyone. 3. The Imperial government sincerely hopes to continue friendly and amicable relations with its neighboring country, China. Therefore, what China most desires is to quickly stabilize its national situation and for the authorities of Japan and Manchukuo to cooperate with each other. It is hoped that genuine trilateral coordination will be realized to maintain peace. 4. Regarding Britain, the United States, France, Russia, and other countries, the Empire had to withdraw from the League of Nations due to different views on the Far Eastern situation. However, there has been no change in the Empire's policy of cooperation with the powers. The Imperial government, in accordance with the spirit of the imperial rescript issued on March 27 of last year, will work with the powers to coordinate and strive to maintain world peace.

<h3>Japan-Taiwan Aviation Plan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The aviation route between Japan and Taiwan, planned by the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, was halted after preparations with the relevant ministries failed to pass the budget. However, recently, feeling acutely the necessity of this aviation route, it has been decided to use 180,000 yen from the Taiwan Governor-General's budget for this fiscal year to realize this plan. The policy is to first establish the Japan Aviation Transport Company with 60,000 yen, practice flying between Kyushu and Taiwan, and then use 110,000 yen to construct a Taiwan airfield and practice flying. It is necessary to fly between Japan and Taiwan in 10 hours, and air transport can be officially opened by 1935. (United Press dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Unrest in Siamese Politics</h3>
<p>The Navy May Launch a Coup</p>
<p>(Singapore) Today, this place received a message from Bangkok claiming that the Siamese political situation now appears to be calm on the surface, but there are strong undercurrents that may cause Siam to enter another revolutionary tide. Siam has undergone three revolutions since June 1932, each with sentiments unfavorable to the throne, but the King of Siam remains in power, though his rights have been restricted. The current brewing undercurrent is in the Navy. The majority of the Navy is currently dissatisfied with the government and is thinking of ways to reform it. People in Bangkok now feel that the Navy leaders may stage a coup, and the government also seems to be aware of the danger to its life and is currently trying to maintain its survival. An order was issued today prohibiting the publication of military news. If the situation does not improve, strict inspections may be implemented. (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Today, it was learned from a certain high-ranking official that the Italian government has sent a memorandum to the French government, listing the summary of the resolutions agreed upon by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and British Foreign Secretary Simon. The Italian Prime Minister's views have already been communicated to the British government. The document is also said to contain suggestions on what measures should be taken if the Franco-German negotiations break down. (National Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<h3>Disarmament Conference Postponed to Allow for Preliminary Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Paris) It is feared that the convening of the Disarmament Conference will be postponed again until February. This seems to have become a foregone conclusion in Paris. It is said that Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and Greek Foreign Minister Politis, who are now in charge of the proceedings of the League of Nations Disarmament Conference, have reached an understanding with the British government and the Secretariat of the League of Nations, and deeply feel that it is indeed necessary to postpone the convening of the Disarmament Conference, at least for two weeks, in order to conduct various preliminary negotiations.

<h3>League of Nations to Hold Meeting, Danzig Issue on Agenda</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The next meeting of the Council of the League of Nations will decide whether the constitution of the Free City of Danzig has been violated by the Danzig Nazi Party government. However, this move contains significant risks, as the Danzig government is now in the hands of the Nazi Party, and Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations and is unwilling to be subjected to any interference from the League of Nations. The League of Nations originally did not want to interfere, but League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig Rosting pleaded so earnestly that it was decided to include this matter on the agenda.

<h3>British Cabinet Discusses Disarmament</h3>
<p>Simon Reports on the Course of Talks with Italy and France</p>
<p>(London) The sub-committee of the Cabinet that is discussing the issue of disarmament, met this afternoon, lasting for two hours. Prime Minister MacDonald chaired the meeting, and Lord President Baldwin, Dominions Secretary Thomas, and Foreign Secretary Simon were present. The memorandum that France had sent to Germany was brought forth for discussion. All believed that France's efforts to come to a settlement, were worthy of praise. Simon then gave an account of the course of the talks that he had had in Paris and Rome, and explained to his cabinet colleagues the suggestions that Prime Minister Mussolini had verbally made to him. According to those in diplomatic circles, it would be difficult for the major countries concerned to acknowledge these suggestions.</p>
<h3>German Reply to France Sent from Daily-Mail</h3>
<p>The sub-committee, finally, listened to the latest report from the British ambassador to Germany, Sir Eric Phipps, who stated that Germany would respond to the French memorandum imminently. Its contents raise questions about some points, and request that France gives precise answers. It is heard that this reply, would be sent within the day. If this statement is correct, then Simon will remain in London temporarily, in order to study the German reply. The task of attending the meeting of the Executive Council of the League of Nations in Geneva, will be taken on by the newly appointed Lord Privy Seal, Eden. (Havas Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee Studies German Military Build-Up</h3>
<p>Insisting on Realization Under Conditions of Security</p>
<p>(Paris) Radical Party Leader Herriot, Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee, presented the recent French memorandum to the German government to the committee. After a lengthy study, the committee unanimously believed that the memorandum was excellent not only in content but also in form. France's firm stance was clearly expressed, while the wording was tactful and the spirit of reconciliation was not lost. One member called it "brave yet cautious." Herriot explained the British view on the arms control system based on various facts and documents, stating that Britain was not easily able to agree to a monitoring system and punitive measures. Member Flaubert called for attention to the principle of arms equality, stating that Germany was not asking for equality with France in terms of the number of troops and armaments. As he saw it, Germany was demanding the same rights as France in terms of national defense. As a result, Germany's military strength would inevitably be far greater than that of France, because Germany's population was larger than France's. Flaubert requested that France continue to adhere to the declaration issued by Britain, France, the United States, Germany, and Italy in Geneva on December 11, 1932, namely that arms equality can only be achieved under conditions of international security. Herriot said that France does not refuse to negotiate with Germany, but other countries that are related to the disarmament issue not only can participate in these negotiations, but also must participate.

<h3>Italian National Defense Policy</h3>
<p>Aviation Budget Greatly Increased</p>
<p>Army System to Undergo Reform</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian national defense budget will be discussed by the Senate tomorrow. The army budget is about 100 million lire less than the previous session, and the navy budget is also 172,000,000 lire less. Only the aviation budget has increased by 24,000,000 lire. The current national defense policy adopted by Italy can be seen from this. Furthermore, the Italian army system will undergo reform soon. The term of military service may be reduced to one year, while the preliminary military training system will be strengthened to compensate for the inadequacy of the short term of military service. (Havas Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) When presenting the army budget to Congress today, the Undersecretary of the Army indicated that the term of military service would be reduced from 18 months to 12 months. The Undersecretary suggested that the conscription of troops should be carried out in full, and that one-fifth of the new recruits should not be exempted as is currently done, in order to compensate for the shortened term. Although the term of military service has been shortened, the number of people conscripted has increased, which is tantamount to increasing the number of new recruits being trained.

<h3>Bulgaria's Exclusion from the Balkan Agreement</h3>
<p>Adding Weight to the Balkan Situation</p>
<p>(Sofia) Bulgaria believes that it may not be possible to conclude a Balkan Agreement based on the suggestion of Turkish, Greek, Romanian, and Yugoslavian Foreign Minister Marcius. Responsible sources in Bulgaria claim that Yugoslavia is still extremely cautious on this issue, and that the plan drawn up by the Turkish Foreign Minister three months ago is also unlikely to succeed. Bulgaria feels that this agreement will not only fail to unite the Balkan countries, but will also add weight to the current unstable situation in the Balkans because it is aimed at Bulgaria.

<h3>Romanian New Cabinet Completed</h3>
<p>Titulescu Accepts the Position of Foreign Minister</p>
<p>(Bucharest) After Titulescu accepted the position of Foreign Minister today, the new cabinet formed in Romania after the assassination of Prime Minister Duca has been completed. The new cabinet had originally decided on Titulescu as Foreign Minister, but Titulescu hesitated to take the position, so Prime Minister Tatarescu took the position himself. It was later reported that Titulescu had put forward conditions for taking office, stating that state power should be in the hands of the government and should not fall into the hands of small parties that are not responsible to the voters. (Reuters Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<h3>Removing Associates of the Monarch as a Condition for Joining the Cabinet</h3>
<p>(Bucharest) The conditions under which former Foreign Minister Titulescu would participate in the new cabinet have been finalized by Titulescu, the King, and the Prime Minister in a compromise manner. The points agreed upon are: 1. To have the King's private secretary, Similescu, dismissed from his position. 2. To have General Dimitrescu, the inspector general of the gendarmerie, also dismissed. Dimitrescu is a relative of the King's private secretary and has been the commander of the gendarmerie for three years. 3. To have General Tang Guxi, the head of the intelligence team, retired. 4. The current Minister of the Army, General Uită, should also retire within three months. (Havas Telegram on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Policy of Amity with France Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Bucharest) Titulescu has agreed to join the new cabinet and resume his position as Foreign Minister, which may stabilize the political situation. Titulescu's conditions for taking office were a strict ban on the Iron Guard and the dismissal of several senior officials who sympathized with the Guard. The King's private secretary, Dumitrescu, and his father, the Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie, were among them, and they were dismissed this afternoon. It is generally expected that Titulescu's joining the new cabinet will mean that Romania will continue to support the Little Entente and the League of Nations, and will do its utmost to oppose the revision of peace treaties and the Four-Power Pact.

<h3>Japan Defends All Railways in the Puppet State with a Settler-Style Security Network</h3>
<p>Dozens of Security Guards to Be Stationed at Over One Hundred Stations</p>
<p>Tasked with Securing the Entire Line and Preventing Attacks by Righteous Armies</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Since the opening of the Rabin Line, the railways in "Manchukuo" have a total length of 3,250 kilometers. However, various sections are frequently attacked by Righteous Armies. Therefore, the Kwantung Army and "Manchukuo" officials discussed countermeasures. As a result, it was decided to station five to ten security guards at each of the railway's hundred-plus stations. It was also decided to completely transform the agricultural land and the security guards into a settler-style railway security network. When this plan is completed, the entire line will have control over more than 2,700 immigrants, who can work with the approximately 4,000 members of the security force currently guarding the line to prevent attacks by Righteous Armies.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of reforming the security agencies in Manchuria, the Foreign, Army, and Colonial Affairs Ministries will soon convene a joint conference to make a final decision. The various opinions are as follows: (1) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes that, from the tenth year onward, the security agencies, acting as consular police officers, will be placed under the control of the embassy. (2) The Kwantung Army believes that the security agencies, due to their close relationship with the military police, should establish a police department within the consulate, with the military police commander concurrently serving as its head. (3) The Colonial Affairs Ministry sees no need to maintain the status quo. Because the three parties have differing opinions, they will wait for reports from officials stationed in Manchuria before holding another conference to make a final decision.

<h3>Franco-Russian Trade Agreement Signed</h3>
<p>Of a Temporary Agreement Nature</p>
<p>Debt Issues Awaiting Further Discussion</p>
<p>(Paris) The new Franco-Russian trade agreement was initialed at the Ministry of Commerce on Wednesday and formally signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today.

The agreement did not address pre-war debt issues, but they were thoroughly discussed in preliminary negotiations. Well-informed sources predict that the two countries will soon negotiate a special agreement on debt. (Eleventh Dispatch via National News Agency)</p>
<h3>Restrictions on British Goods Entering France</h3>
<p>Britain Lodges Protest with the French Foreign Ministry</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the British Commercial Counselor here lodged a protest with the French Foreign Ministry regarding France's restrictions on the import of British goods. It is expected that the French government, after clarifying the situation, will abolish the newly issued quotas. The new quotas represent a 75% reduction compared to the previous ones. France seems dissatisfied with Britain's abolition of free trade, so it will adopt a different approach to tariff negotiations with Britain. Although France recently abolished the 15% surtax on British imports to avoid causing an economic war with Britain, it simultaneously reduced the quota for British imports by 75%, affecting as many as 135 types of goods, resulting in an annual loss of £8 million in British trade. Furthermore, according to Britain's import tax bill, Britain can levy a 100% tax on imports from countries that discriminate against British goods, while the value of French wine and silk imported into Britain is approximately £8 million per year, which is equivalent to the amount lost by Britain.

<h3>Guaranteeing the Neutrality of the Baltic States</h3>
<p>Reports of Russian-Polish Proposal Are Premature</p>
<p>Foreign sources in the Estonian capital have recently reported that Soviet Russia and Poland have simultaneously proposed to Estonia that the two countries guarantee the neutrality of the Baltic states and the integrity of their territories. According to responsible sources, this news is a misunderstanding. During a recent speech by Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov, he stated that the independence and territorial integrity of the Baltic states must be maintained. Listeners misinterpreted this, leading to the aforementioned rumor. Local newspapers do not strongly support the idea of the Baltic states' neutrality being guaranteed by Russia and Poland. When a journalist asked the Foreign Minister for his opinion on the neutrality issue, the Foreign Minister replied that it had not yet been mentioned and might be considered in the future, but that the foundation of neutrality must be broad, in other words, based on the League of Nations.

<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Debates the Bayonne Fraud Case</h3>
<p>Demanding Thorough Clarification of Official Corruption</p>
<p>Political Atmosphere Remains Tense</p>
<p>(Paris) The debate on the Bayonne fraud case, which arose from a motion of confidence in the government proposed by Radical Socialist Party leader Herriot, began this afternoon in the Chamber of Deputies. The outcome of this debate is currently uncertain. According to Herriot's motion, the Chamber of Deputies should declare its demand to adopt free and active judicial actions to thoroughly investigate the malfeasance. (Eleventh Dispatch via Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) During today's debate in the Chamber of Deputies on the Bayonne fraud case, there may be historic and unprecedentedly fierce attacks on government officials. The Chamber of Deputies will propose six impeachment cases against the government to determine responsibility for the political and administrative errors discovered in this case, and intends to prosecute derelict officials to protect public funds and prevent future malfeasance. Since the disclosure of this matter, the people have expressed deep dissatisfaction with the authorities and demanded thorough clarification. Although Stavisky has committed suicide, the tense political atmosphere has not eased. The public suspects that politicians also shared in Stavisky's gains. (Eleventh Dispatch via Reuters)</p>
<h3>Huge Swindler Buried, Theater Manager Surrenders</h3>
<p>(Paris) The body of French swindler Stavisky was buried today in the municipal cemetery of Chamonix. Only a few local curious onlookers attended. His wife fainted when Stavisky was buried. Haiode, the manager of the Paris Imperial Theater, has surrendered to the police. He had been in hiding for some time and is now being escorted to Bayonne for trial under strict police surveillance. Furthermore, since the occurrence of this fraud case, socialist newspapers have risen up to make things difficult for the Paris Police Commissioner Chappee, claiming that Chappee's authority is no less than that of Fouché in the era of Napoleon. The Socialist Party's organ, Le Populaire, stated today that if Premier Chautemps does not agree to sacrifice Chappee, it will be very difficult for the Socialist Party to provide political support. Although Chappee is not an accomplice of Stavisky, his police organization must have many people who are in league with Stavisky, otherwise, why was Stavisky, who was arrested in 1926 for a major case and kept under surveillance for a year, never brought to trial? Therefore, the Socialist Party believes that the current Police Commissioner must be dismissed, as he was the mastermind behind Stavisky's escape. (Tenth Dispatch via National News Agency)</p>
<h3>Three "Sacred" Journalists Also Implicated</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Prefect of Bayonne will request the lifting of parliamentary immunity for Radical Party member Penol, who was Stavisky's lawyer, and has issued arrest warrants for Dubari, a director of the Volonte newspaper, and Aimar, former director of the Nationalist Party's organ, Liberte. Penol is accused of using Stavisky's money to campaign for election. According to Le Matin, Dubari received 2 million francs from Stavisky, and Aimar received at least 6,000 francs on two occasions. Both are well-known journalists, respected by their colleagues, and their arrest has caused great shock in the press. Dubari is seen as one of the most influential journalists today. During a meeting of the Radical Socialist Party Executive Committee, Herriot declared that any party member who commits a crime will be expelled from the party.

<h3>Roosevelt Promotes Rural Development</h3>
<p>Message to Congress to Amend Loan Act</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt sent a message to Congress today proposing an amendment to the Emergency Farm Mortgage Act, allowing the government to guarantee $200 million in bonds to subsidize the principal of rural mortgages. The interest on the bonds is already guaranteed. President Roosevelt stated that he firmly believes the government has a moral responsibility to guarantee these bonds, so that they would be on par with Treasury securities. In effect, the government's liability would increase by $200 million, but this moral obligation must be openly acknowledged. In any case, the bonds to be issued will not only be secured by the government's credit, but also by assets of tangible value. Democratic leaders now believe this proposal will pass.

After drafting six measures, which were sent to the provincial governments throughout the country to instruct their counties to comply, two additional measures were specified yesterday and sent to the provincial governments to instruct their subordinates to comply: (1) For cases of disaster relief or land acquisition for public purposes occurring before the beginning of the 22nd year, requests for remission or postponement of land tax may still list the amount of silver and rice, but the equivalent amount in national currency should also be included. (2) For all cases requesting remission or postponement of land tax occurring after the beginning of the 22nd year, only the amount of national currency due should be listed, and the amount of silver and rice should no longer be listed, in order to ensure uniformity.

<h3>汴黑岡口 河堤 危傾</h3>
<p>(Kaifeng) The Heigangkou riverbank, 30 li from Bian (Kaifeng), has been eroded and loosened by rapid currents during last year's autumn floods, causing it to tilt. According to a report by a certain water conservancy expert, the water surface there has suddenly narrowed to fifty or sixty zhang, with the current becoming extremely turbulent. It is inevitable that a breach will occur during this year's autumn floods, which will cut off both the Longhai and Jinpu railways, divert the Huai River into the Yangtze River, and inundate Jiangsu and Anhui, causing immense damage. Even if breaches occur anywhere in Lanfeng, Kaocheng, Zhongmu, and Yuanwu counties, they will inevitably lead to the above-mentioned disasters. Liu Zhi, upon receiving the report, has telegraphed Jiangsu, Anhui, and the Ministry of Railways, requesting them to send personnel to Bian to jointly investigate and plan for prevention.

<h3>Soviet Union's Preparation for World War (Vladivostok Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Perceives Japan's Intentions</p>
<p>150,000 Red Army Troops Concentrated in the Far East</p>
<p>The protagonist of the First World War was Germany, the location was Europe, and the main warring countries were Germany, Britain, France, and Russia. The major reason for the war, as everyone now acknowledges, was economic relations, arising from the struggle between Britain and Germany for economic hegemony.</p>
<p>Now, after the First World War, European countries have only superficially restored the prosperity of the pre-war markets. In reality, each has its weaknesses. For example, Britain has three million unemployed workers, and Germany has five million. This alone is enough to make the countries involved wary of launching challenges, fearing that it would provoke internal unrest that could become uncontrollable. France seems to be doing better than other countries on the European continent, but it is only slightly better in comparison. The internal difficulties are not something to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>In Europe, there is only one unique and different country: the Soviet Union. During the period of implementing the first five-year plan, it certainly still has shortcomings. These shortcomings, on the surface, if one travels across Siberia via the Trans-Siberian Railway, through Moscow to Europe, a traveler accustomed to a capitalist system will feel a lot of discomfort and will see that the Soviet Union has many unsound areas. In particular, the Soviet people's daily necessities always feel insufficient. The clothing of rural farmers is especially lacking, not to mention food.</p>
<p>But this is precisely its - the Soviet Union's - advantage. Its people, united from top to bottom, practice frugality to engage in their ideal construction. They exploit themselves to build the means of production. However, this is not very visible in the Far East, such as in the coastal provinces like Amur Province. One reason is that these places are vast and sparsely populated, and the weather is cold. The second reason is the threat of external aggression, so there is not much significant progress.</p>
<p>Who is this threatening person? Fellow compatriots living in the motherland can imagine it. It is the protagonist of the Second World War, the Japanese imperialists. For the past two years, they have been preparing for armed conflict every day. In the general view of the world, the future international conflict will be in the Pacific, a conflict mainly between Japan and the United States, or a rivalry between Britain and Japan for the Chinese market. However, from the perspective of those of us living in another environment, although these types of conflicts are also becoming increasingly fierce and neither side is willing to concede, their bases, whether political or military, are too far apart. Moreover, a naval war over such a long distance is not easy to initiate. Even if aircraft have a fast travel speed, their range is not great. Therefore, in reality, there is an even greater possibility than a war between Britain and the United States against Japan.</p>
<p>This is the Soviet-Japanese war. If the Soviet Union had not adhered to a policy of peace for the past two years and adopted a policy of observation, it would have provoked a direct conflict long ago. Because Japan's continental policy is not only to annex South Manchuria, but also to bring North Manchuria under its control, and plans to invade Siberia, taking Siberia's resources for its own use, especially using the oil of the northern part of Sakhalin to alleviate Japan's oil shortage.</p>
<p>Japan's intentions have become clearer day by day. The reason it dares not launch an attack is: first, the internal contradictions of capitalist countries cannot be reconciled, and they do not recognize Japan as the vanguard of an attack on the Soviet Union. Second, Japan itself has no financial certainty. After the extension of the military period, it cannot maintain its certainty of victory. The struggles against China in the past two years, the superficial victory, and the actual difficulties are clear evidence. However, Japan is still advancing step by step. In addition to seizing the Chinese Eastern Railway, it is secretly directing White Russians in Harbin and other places to form anti-Red organizations.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Soviet Union has openly stated that if Japan dares to invade Siberia, the Soviet Red Army will resolutely rise up in self-defense. This can be attested to by the speeches of People's Commissar Molotov and Foreign Minister Litvinov. Their words are not just empty talk. We see that General Blyukher (i.e., Galen) has returned to his post as commander of the Far Eastern Army, stationed in Khabarovsk to command. Now, from Vladivostok to the Baikal region, 150,000 iron-blooded Red Army soldiers, it is not difficult to glimpse the Soviet Union's intentions. Furthermore, from January 1, 1934, the salaries of Red Army soldiers and junior officers stationed in the Far East will increase by 50 percent, and the salaries of middle and senior officers will increase by 20 percent. At the same time, they will also encourage Siberian immigration. This is precisely to compete with the Japanese imperialists' continental policy. (December 30, 1933)</p>
<h3>Chiang Orders Blockade of Hubei-Shaanxi-Gansu-Sichuan Border Area</h3>
<p>Promulgates Implementation Measures and Divides Areas</p>
<p>Designates Various Pacification Headquarters and Sichuan General Headquarters to Handle</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xu Xiangqian's remnant bandits have been entrenched in various counties in northern Sichuan and have harassed southern Shaanxi for a year now. Although the various Sichuan armies have been dispatched to suppress them separately, the main force of the bandits does not seem to have been completely defeated. Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to the anti-bandit operations in Sichuan. In addition to telegraphing Liu Xiang to direct the various armies to make concerted efforts, he has also deemed that the blockade policies in various places have been effective, and that it is necessary to effectively blockade the impoverished counties in northern Sichuan to cut off the bandits' supplies. Therefore, he has formulated methods for blockading the border areas of Hubei, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan, which have been promulgated and implemented. Generally, the areas under the jurisdiction of the four provinces are divided into four zones: the Hubei border area is designated to be managed by a management office established by the Hubei Pacification Headquarters; the Shaanxi border area is the responsibility of the Shaanxi Pacification Headquarters; the Gansu border area is the responsibility of the Gansu Pacification Headquarters; and the Sichuan border area is the responsibility of the Sichuan Anti-Bandit General Headquarters. It is also stipulated that the progress of the various headquarters should be reported to the Wuchang Henan-Hubei-Anhui Three Provinces Anti-Bandit General Headquarters for review. (January 10)</p>
<h3>Hubei Eastern Rural Planning Recovery</h3>
<p>Chiang Orders Hubei Provincial Government to Handle</p>
<p>And Investigate Junxian People's Uprising</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The counties in eastern Hubei, such as Huangma, have been ravaged by bandits for the longest time, and the people have suffered the most. In December of last year, Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun returned from an inspection tour of the area and said that the misery was indescribable to those who had not experienced it personally. In Huang'an County alone, more than 200,000 people were killed, and the area between Huang'an and Qiliping was desolate, devoid of people and animals. On the 4th and 5th of this month, Cheng Ruhua, the administrative commissioner of the Fourth District, also inspected the Yanggonghe, Bailuoqiu, Shizishan, Sanjiaoshan, Erdaoqiao, Yejiahe, and Zhao Jiagang areas of Huang'an, and the Dasongshu area of Macheng. He saw houses burned down, fields barren, and the few people present looking emaciated, no different from the misery in the Ziyun district of Qiliping. He telegraphed Chairman Chiang with the various situations and drafted measures for approval. Chiang replied to Zhang Cheng on the 8th, saying, "The barren land and emaciated people in the Yejiahe area are truly pitiful. The proposed measures for summoning refugees, lending seeds for relief, and restoring rural areas are essential. Please direct their thorough implementation," and so on.</p>
<p>As for the resettlement of immigrants from the bandit areas, it is currently being stepped up. The number of refugees moved out has reached 20,000. Chiang also ordered the Hubei Provincial Government to quickly devise resettlement measures to provide relief. After deliberation by the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Departments, four measures were decided on the 10th: 1. Resettlement of refugee land reclamation measures: (1) The number of refugees to be moved out shall be investigated and reported by Director Cheng (Ruhua) of the Eastern Hubei Immigration Affairs Office; (2) Calculated for six months, each person needs about 12 yuan in living expenses, plus about 10 yuan for agricultural tools, seeds, and housing, totaling 22 yuan; (3) Each person will be granted ten mu of land; (4) The location of the land grants will be the public wasteland in Xiangyang, Jiayu, and Wuchang. 2. Job introduction measures for refugees: (1) Select refugees to build roads. The Bianqu Limalu will resettle 1,000 strong refugees, and the roads in various districts in northern Hubei will resettle 2,000 strong refugees; (2) Introduce female workers to work in small-scale hand-weaving factories, sock factories, and towel factories. The factories in Wuhan will resettle two people as the standard, and a total of only 66 female workers can be resettled. 3. Subsidy measures for making a living: The Eastern Hubei Immigration Affairs Office will inquire about the refugees' aspirations and their original occupations, and report for handling. 4. Measures for the shelter of elderly, weak, and disabled refugees: Each county has a very small number of relief homes, and funding is extremely difficult. The Eastern Hubei Immigration Affairs Office will investigate the number of people, concentrate them in Wuhan, and raise funds from various charitable organizations and philanthropists to shelter them.</p>
<p>In Jun County, northern Hubei, a people's uprising occurred last winter. The Yu-E-Wan Three Provinces Anti-Bandit General Headquarters reported, according to a report from the Political Training Office of the Nanchang Camp, which was forwarded from the report of Li Zhengjun, a trainer from the 303rd Regiment stationed in Jun County dispatched by Li Jinxiang, the director of the Political Training Office of the 51st Division. The report stated that the areas of the people's uprising, Longzhuan Gou and Lijia Ying, are all mountainous areas with barren land and impoverished people, who are superstitious about religion and have shallow knowledge. The land tax in the area is heavy, and the former land survey committee members Xiao Mingchuan, Ye Hualin, Wang Zhian, etc., acted on bribes, suppressed the truth, and there were many other miscellaneous taxes. In addition to the district security office expenses and the security team donations, there were also special expenses and temporary expenses. The security team's collection of fees in the countryside often gave the people a bad impression, and the resentment was deep, which led to the riot. It was due to the barren land, impoverished people, shallow knowledge of the people, most of whom were superstitious about low-level churches, coupled with poor local politics, too heavy a burden on the people, and the security team's constant resentment of the people, that they were exploited by petty people, resulting in a major change. Although the matter has been settled, the root cause has not been eradicated. It is reasonable to forward it for review. The headquarters ordered Li Guojun, the administrative inspector of the Eleventh District, to pay attention, and ordered the provincial government to be informed. However, the provincial government has not reported any record of the people's uprising. Therefore, the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Security Departments were ordered to investigate the details of the people's uprising at the time and how heavy the various taxes in the county were, and to draft measures for lightening the burden and providing relief for review and forwarding in order to eliminate future troubles.

<h3>Situation of the End of the Guizhou War</h3>
<p>You Guocai Suddenly Cooperates with Wang</p>
<p>Jiang Zaizhen Also Submits to Wang</p>
<p>Beijing News: Recently, there have been conflicting rumors about the situation of the Guizhou war. According to a gentleman who recently came to Beijing from Chongqing, since the Allied forces attacked the departments of Che, Lei, Yang, and Li on the eastern road and captured Zhenyuan, and after Wang Jialie's Sichuan general Pi Dexu was killed, the situation of the provincial army was extremely precarious. Later, He Zhiben rushed to Guiyang by plane, and the morale was slightly stabilized. Wang Jialie immediately used He to deal with the northwest roads, and changed the dispatch of Bai Huizhang's entire army to the east to assist Liao Huaisi, and drove the Che department out of Zhenyuan, and cut off the connection between the Lei and Yang departments. Therefore, You Guocai on the western road and Jiang Zaizhen on the northern road were both constrained by their backgrounds, and had to make their own plans. In particular, You's department had no combat capability. Suddenly, there was news that Long Yun had telegraphed to transfer Wan Baobang's Yunnan army to help You, and it was also rumored that Wang Jialie had a proposal to draw Liao's department from the eastern road to solve the western road, so they changed course with the wind and telegraphed to Wang Jialie to express cooperation, saying that we are all from the same hometown, classmates, and the same system, how close is our relationship? If we continue to go to extremes, we will only create opportunities for the Xingyi faction, which has always advocated the overthrow of the 25th Army. Isn't it a more obvious act of suicide, etc. The article was more than a thousand words long. Wang was enlightened after reading it, and decided to send He Zhiben, together with Gao Gui, the president of the court, Xie Xuntao, the special party committee member Huang Chongyu, and Dan Maoxin and Fu Chunchu, to travel west from the province by car on December 28, and then change to shoulder carriers from Guoshu to Xingyi County, where You Huang was located, on the 4th of this month to exchange views. As a result, since Wang's department is called the 25th Army, and You's department also publicizes itself to the outside world under the name of the 25th Army, it is better to give the position of army commander to You, so as to avoid the joke of having two 25th Armies. You was very satisfied with the comparison. As for Jiang Zaizhen on the northern road, seeing that the Wang department sent to contact You's department, not only had Dan Maoxin, Long Yun's representative, but also Fu Chunchu, Liu Xiang's representative, it was not only a symbol that Yunnan was unwilling to help You, but also clear evidence that Sichuan would not help him. Therefore, he also made a request to Wang Jialie, hoping to obtain Zheng'an County as a defense zone, so that they could cooperate to resist all troops other than the 25th Army. Wang allowed it, and Hou Zhijun, stationed in Zunyi, mediated. Now Jiang's troops have completed their withdrawal from Dongxi on the Sichuan border to Zheng'an, which is the second step of negotiation. As for Lei Mingjiu, who was called a tiger general by the Allied forces, suddenly died in battle, which was a major blow to the Allied forces. This is why the Guizhou war is coming to an end.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Changyuan Blocking Project</h3>
<p>|Most of it has been blocked|</p>
<p>Changyuan Correspondence: The Changyuan Yellow River breach was started to be blocked by the Yellow River Flood Relief Work Relief Team last year. Most of the project has now been completed, with only the third ditch of Fenglou not blocked. However, the Yellow River's water potential changes daily, and coupled with the new waterway opened by the break at Shitou Zhuang below the ditch, the situation is not only changing, but also the riverbed is four or five feet lower than the original one. Due to the downward nature of the water, the main current has shifted completely, making the project difficult and dangerous. Song Xishang, the chief engineer of the association, recently went to Zhengzhou to contact Qian Zongze of the Longhai Railway Bureau to transport stone materials. Then, on the first of this month, he led the engineers Li Cuqiang, etc., to the construction site and opened night work. The chevron dam of the third ditch has been connected to the island tree in the heart of the river on the 5th. According to Song, there is an urgent need for a large amount of stone willow and other materials, which have been raised separately. It will take about two more months to transport them all. He will work day and night to fully block the breach. Song plans to stay permanently at the construction site.</p>
<h3>Anhui Rice Exports Decreasing Year by Year</h3>
<p>|Statistics of Imports and Exports in the 21st Year|</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Anhui Province has always been a rice-producing area, and Wuhu is the center of the rice market in the province. According to statistics of previous years, the rice exported from Wuhu was more than 6 million shi in the 14th year of the Republic of China (1925), and decreased to more than 2 million shi in the 15th, 16th, and 17th years. In the 21st year, it was only more than 1.3 million shi. In terms of price, it used to be worth more than ten yuan per shi, but recently the rice price in Wuhu is worth more than five yuan per shi. In other places, it is about four yuan or more. The grain price is only one yuan and six or seven corners per shi. Farmers work hard all year round, and what they rely on for their livelihood is rice. Now that the grain price is low, sales are stagnant, and income is sharply reduced, they are unable to provide for their food and clothing, and they have no surplus to pay taxes. As a result, industry and commerce in various places are depressed, and the market is deserted. The impact is not small. Recently, the three departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction, following the order of the provincial government, transferred the order of Chairman Chiang to jointly formulate measures to abolish the malpractice of food merchant firms, and issued it to 61 counties in the province for compliance. The Construction Department, in order to regulate food, plans to establish a food management committee in Wuhu and implement a food control policy to prevent cheap food from harming farmers and expensive food from harming the people. However, there are many obstacles, and it has not yet been realized. Now, the Civil Affairs Department has statistics on the amount of various grains exported and imported in Anhui Province in the 21st year. The total export amount is 21,353,016 shi, and the total import amount is 4,102,604 shi. In terms of exports, rice is 10,980,795 shi, barley is 747,604 shi, wheat is 4,250,413 shi, soybeans are 3,375,955 shi, mung beans are 333,615 shi, peas are 178,246 shi, broad beans are 34,610 shi, sorghum is 788,827 shi, sesame is 482,482 shi, buckwheat is 3,169 shi, and sweet potatoes are 177,300 shi. In terms of imports, rice is 2,778,294 shi, barley is 121,997 shi, wheat is 749,369 shi, soybeans are 154,960 shi, mung beans are 60,928 shi, broad beans are 60 shi, sorghum is 2,600 shi, sesame is 109,916 shi, and sweet potatoes are 94,900 shi.

<h3>Travel Notes in Sichuan and Kang (2)</h3>
<p>|From Nanjing to Hankou| Li Xing</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM on the 8th, the Yongnian wheel left Beijing and continued westward. At around 3:00 PM on the 9th, the boat passed Xiaogushan. Passengers went out of the cabin to enjoy the beautiful scenery. At noon on the 10th, the boat passed by the Daye Iron Factory. The spirit of the factory has been controlled by others. Looking from the railing, I felt unhappy. That day, the boatman accidentally told me that the water was small and the road was dangerous above Hankou, and the boat could not travel at night. Therefore, the date of arrival in Yichang should be around the 15th, and the earliest arrival in Chongqing should be around the 21st or 22nd. It takes more than two weeks to travel from Shanghai to Chongqing by water. If you take a plane, it only takes two days. The economy of time is almost more than double. However, the price of civilian aviation from Shanghai to Chongqing is 500 yuan, so only dignitaries can afford to ride, and it is not something that ordinary people can talk about. That afternoon, the boat arrived in Hankou, scheduled to leave at 4:00 AM on the 11th, and then go west. (January 10)</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<h3>Songqing Two Counties Surveying and Determining Boundary</h3>
<p>The area of ​​the forty-three bao and eleven tu places bordering Qingpu County in this county is jagged and protrudes into the Qing territory. Qingpu County Government previously proposed to transfer the Songyi address of the tu to Qingpu area in order to facilitate administration. A map was drawn and submitted to the province for approval. Then, the provincial land bureau member Ran Zhonghu was sent to Song to meet with the county heads of Songqing and Qing to conduct on-site surveys. Jin Jian, the county head, led the first district chief Li Zufu and clerk Shen Houkui to the countryside at 8:00 am today, and drove to Guangfulin. Qingpu County Chief Xu Jia Ying led the Qingzhang high captain to meet them there. Under the supervision of Ran Provincial Commissioner, both parties surveyed. It was decided that Changbang would be the boundary, and about 20 mu of land in the forty-three bao and eleven tu of Songyi would be transferred to Qingpu County area. It is said that the situation of today's survey and the delimitation map will still need to be submitted to the province for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>New Appointed Police Chief Taking Over</h3>
<p>Shen Jing, the police chief of this county, has been in office for three years and has been self-disciplined, and is admired by the people of the county. Suddenly, he was dismissed by the provincial hall. All sectors telegraphed the province to retain him, but it was not approved. The new police chief, Zhou Ding, is a native of Guizhou and used to be a soldier. He arrived in Song on the 10th and stayed at the Daxin Hotel. After visiting Commissioner Jin, he took office at 4:00 pm on the 11th. The outgoing director Shen Jing, after completing the handover, was respectfully sent to the transportation hotel by all the officers and policemen. Dozens of silver shields and mirror frames presented by all walks of life were full of dazzling arrays, and firecrackers were set off to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Rental Contract Dispute</h3>
<p>There are more than 2,000 rickshaws in Suzhou. Most of their permits are sublet by companies from general car permit lessors (car permit lessors initially paid donations to the officialdom to obtain them, each costing about 160 yuan, and then donated two yuan per month, while companies rent them for five yuan and one corner per month). However, to operate at the railway station, another small permit from the station must be obtained. Recently, the Car Permit Leasing Industry Association believed that the methods formulated by the Railway Bureau for obtaining permits were harsh. The Leasing Industry Association applied for the permits according to law, but the Railway Bureau refused to issue them. However, the companies were absolutely accommodated when they went to apply for them. Therefore, it was decided that from the 10th of this month, when the companies rented permits from the car permit merchants, they should all be required to sign a contract not to operate at the station. Otherwise, the rental contract of the car permit will be recovered at any time as a countermeasure. The reason is that rickshaws can only operate with the station small permit. In the future, after the company obtains the small permit, due to the relationship of the capital, it will inevitably not release the large permit. For the sake of its own interests, it has to be so. If the companies do not sign the above rental contract, the car permit merchants can stop renting the permits to the companies and collect the rental price of five yuan and one corner from the association. Recently, because the rickshaw companies did not sign the rental contract, the car permit merchants sent the permits to the association, resulting in empty vehicles that could not operate. Yesterday (11th) at 10 o'clock in the morning, dozens of people gathered at the Furenfang Leasing Industry Association to cause trouble, and there was quite a dispute for a while. The Public Security Bureau sent a flying squad to the scene to suppress them. After about an hour, the representatives of the companies signed the rental contract of not going to the station as usual, and took the car permit to operate.</p>
<h3>Song Zhiqi, Suspected of Being Reactionary, Acquitted and Released</h3>
<p>Song Zhiqi, the husband of Liu Liying, a female actress of Lianhua Company, is 20 years old and from Beiping. He is a teacher at a girls' middle school in Shanghai. He was arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau on suspicion of being a reactionary and sent to the Suzhou High Court. Prosecutor Lai investigated him and filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 6 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China. Huang Bingdao, the presiding judge of the Criminal Provisional Court, opened a trial. As a result, Song was acquitted due to insufficient suspicion. Yesterday (11th) at 2:00 pm, Prosecutor Lai, who originally handled the case, released him from the court.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Robber Arrested in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Xu A'gen, a villager from Jinshanding in Huangdai Township, used to work as a servant in the Shanghai police station. After losing his job, he became a bandit. On October 27 last year, he colluded with many people to rob a family surnamed in 301 Shanhai Guan Road in Shanghai and fled back to his hometown. Recently, the Shanghai Public Concession Police Department learned of it and sent Detective Zhao Fuhai to Suzhou to join the Detective Team to go to his hometown and arrest Xu and send him to Shanghai for legal action.</p>
<h3>Niu Lan on Hunger Strike, High Court Extends Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>Chief Prosecutor Hu Yigu of the High Court said, (1) Niu Lan's hunger strike has been handled by the High Court and this office jointly issuing instructions to the First Prison to give good guidance and protection, and to extend the invitation to Westerners at the Gulou Hospital to the prison for treatment. (2) The Jin Shuren case is in the process of investigation. It is difficult to approve the bail requested by the generals of Xinjiang.</p>
<h3>The Gan Yun Case Begins Investigation</h3>
<p>After the Fujian Provincial Party Committee member Gan Yun was sent to Suzhou, Prosecutor Zhu Jun questioned him in court yesterday (11th) at 3:00 pm. After half an hour, the result was that the High Court was not clear who the accuser in this case was. Therefore, in addition to sending a letter to the Central Party Department to prove the case, Gan was ordered to submit a written statement for further verification.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<h3>Stipulating the Clothing of Singers</h3>
<p>Director Fu of the Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital believes that the strange costumes of the singers and the swaggering on the streets are related to social morality. He previously proposed to use black clothes, black edges, and black buttons as the prescribed clothing for singers, and has submitted it to the Civil Affairs Department for approval. It is now known that the case has been approved by the Civil Affairs Department and will be implemented as planned. It is heard that the bureau has now notified the various Qingchang tea houses to inform the singers to implement it uniformly from February 2.</p>
<h3>Installation of Water Lines Between Zhenjiang and Yangzhou</h3>
<p>To facilitate communication between the north and south of the Yangtze River, the Ministry of Transportation yesterday dispatched Pan Shoubo, a water line engineer from the Shanghai-Hankou Engineering Office, leading a team of craftsmen, to Zhenjiang on a special transport. They brought eight pairs of water lines, planning to install four pairs in Yangzhou, one pair in Taizhou, one pair in Qingjiang, one pair in Gaoyou, and one pair in Haian. After arriving in Zhenjiang yesterday, they immediately visited Mr. Liu Songtao, Director of the Jiangsu Long-Distance Telephone Administration, to discuss all matters. They then traveled to Yangzhou by steamer and are scheduled to start installation today. The work is expected to be completed within a week. After this, calls between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Yangzhou will no longer need to be transferred and can be connected directly.</p>
<h3>Appeal of Wu Chengyang Case</h3>
<p>Wu Chengyang, the former head of the Third Autonomous District who was dismissed and sentenced to life imprisonment for suspected murder, and Wang Ruizhi, the district secretary, declared their dissatisfaction in court and filed an appeal after the judgment by the local court in this port. It is now learned that the Jiangsu High Court in Zhenjiang has transferred the entire case file to Suzhou for review. Wu and others will be sent to Suzhou for interrogation in the coming days.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<h3>Qing Sheng Theater Sealed</h3>
<p>The Qing Sheng Theater on Dongxin Road outside Guangfu Gate was sealed by a team dispatched by Yu Xizhi, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the Third Regiment of the Supplementary Brigade of the Second Division of the Wuxi Army, at 5:00 AM yesterday (the 11th). The notice stated that the reason for the sealing was that when the battalion sent a team to inspect the theater on the evening of the 6th of this month, the theater resisted the inspection and injured soldiers, so it was sealed as a warning. The theater owners, Li Hanxiang, Li Yingjie, and Li Xingquan, three brothers, were detained and taken to the Huishan battalion headquarters for investigation.</p>
<h3>Local Budget for This Year</h3>
<p>Zhao Dihua, the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, organized a County Budget Review Committee to review the budgets of various counties. The first batch of ten counties, including Zhenjiang, has already summoned the county heads to the province for discussions. However, counties such as Wuxi have not yet been summoned. Therefore, it has been decided to summon the county heads of Wuxi and other counties to the province on January 17th to discuss the local budget for the 23rd year of the Republic. The County Government of this district has been notified by telegram. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Yan convened a budget meeting yesterday with thirteen local impartial gentlemen, including Xu Chizi, Chen Zhanru, Wu Shimei, and Cai Xiansan. The results were as follows: 1. Adhere to the teachings of the Prime Minister and ensure that the local land tax does not exceed 1%; 2. The agricultural improvement donation will be changed to 1.2%; 3. The land survey fee will be changed to 3.3%; 4. The security patrol donation will be changed to 1.5%; 5. The provincial road construction land tax will be completely reduced; 6. The county road construction land tax will be changed to 1.5% (of which 0.5% is designated for water conservancy expenses); 7. Qian Sunqing and Chen Zhanru are publicly recommended to attend the provincial budget meeting.</p>

<h3>Truth About the Dispute at the Women's Nursing Home</h3>
<p>The No. 1 Nursing Home of the County Relief Institute (namely Quan Jie Tang) had a dispute due to the change of director. An inside story has now been learned from relevant parties. The former director of the home, Li Haiping, was transferred to be the director of the No. 3 Nursing Home in Shaobo. In order to please the widows, he distributed 3,000 yuan of accumulated rice price funds over the years to the widows. The widows collectively elected six representatives to be responsible for the safekeeping of the funds for the future education of orphans and the marriage expenses of orphan girls. However, this accumulated fund was due to the fact that during the years 17 and 18 of the Republic of China, when rice prices rose, it was impossible to maintain the original standard. Therefore, the Charity Office decided that regardless of whether rice prices rose or fell, the price would be calculated at 10 yuan per picul. However, in recent years, rice prices have been falling, so there is this saved fund. According to regulations, it should be used as a reserve fund to prevent future rice price increases or insufficient funds in the institute, and should not be distributed without authorization. Therefore, after the new director, Gao Jingru, took over, he ordered the widows to hand over the passbooks. The widows, not understanding the situation, resisted, leading to a dispute. Later, Jiang Xiaoting, the director of the No. 1 Women's Education and Training Center, and Xu Tingsong, the director of the Nursery, were dispatched by the Charity Organization Management Committee to earnestly persuade them. The widows finally handed over the保管印鑑 (official seal for safekeeping) and declared that it was a misunderstanding, bringing the dispute to an end.</p>
<h3>Two Fishing Boats Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>Qiao Wende, a fishmonger from Gaoyou, loaded several loads of fish and shrimp on a boat and transported them to Yangzhou for sale. At around 6:00 PM on the 9th, when he was traveling to the entrance of the Six Gates in Shaobo, a boat suddenly approached, and more than ten bandits jumped out of the cabin. They were wearing white headbands and carrying box guns, threatening the fishing boat and claiming to be conducting an inspection. They robbed all the fish, shrimp, clothes, and money on the boat and fled in their original boat. In less than two hours, Wu Sentai, a fishmonger from Wangjiagang in Gaoyou, also loaded more than 700 catties of fresh fish on a boat to sell in Yangzhou. There was also a female passenger on the boat, carrying 24 silver dollars and clothing. They were also intercepted by more than ten bandits wearing white headbands in a boat. Both fishing boats have now arrived in Yangzhou and reported the robbery to the authorities, requesting them to investigate.</p>

<h3>All Chinese Medicine Practitioners in the County Must Register and Take Exams</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau, concerned about quack doctors causing deaths, submitted a registration method, examination regulations, and a survey form to the County Government. The proposals were approved by the political affairs meeting and submitted to the Provincial Government for approval. The Public Security Bureau, in conjunction with the Health Association, will conduct registration for all Chinese medicine practitioners in the county. The examination method is as follows: Before the central government promulgates the medical practitioner law, all practicing Chinese medicine practitioners within the county should follow the regulations and be examined by the County Government, which will hire reputable Chinese medicine practitioners to organize a Chinese medicine examination committee to conduct the Chinese medicine examination once a year. The qualifications for taking the exam are: practicing medicine in the local area for more than four years, having been taught by a master for more than three years, and having rich research and practical experience in medical knowledge. Those who pass the exam will be issued a business license. The registration qualifications are: graduating from a national university or a Chinese medicine college with a diploma, or having been taught by a master for more than four years and having a certificate from the master. Those who practice medicine in this county without registration and qualification will be fined up to 100 yuan and ordered to cease operations. The date and location of the examination and registration will be decided at a meeting on the 10th.</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Describes Impressions and Feelings of His European Tour</h3>
<p>Published Written Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>Du and Zhang Host Banquet to Welcome Zhang</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Xueliang, who has returned from his tour of Europe, released a written statement yesterday, reporting on his impressions and feelings of his European trip and the reasons for his return to China. Finance Minister Kong and General Li Du visited him yesterday morning one after the other, reminiscing about the long separation. Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin hosted a banquet last night to welcome Zhang, inviting his former subordinates to accompany him. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Kong and Du Visit One After Another</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, visited Mr. Zhang yesterday morning at 10:15 AM, leaving at 11:10 AM after a long conversation. Li Du, a famous general in the Anti-Japanese War, also visited Mr. Zhang yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, leaving after about half an hour. According to Mr. Mi Chunlin, Finance Minister Kong's visit to Mr. Zhang was a reunion, a completely private and friendly visit. The rumor transmitted from Nanjing that Mr. Zhang will be appointed as the Minister of the Military and Political Department has not been heard here and is likely inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Du and Zhang Host Welcome Banquet Last Night</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin hosted a banquet last night at around 7:00 PM to welcome Zhang, inviting leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai and Zhang's former subordinates Bao Wenying, Ying Zhen, Wang Shuchang, Mi Chunlin, Zhu Guangmu, Li Yingchao, Shen Zutong, and Tang Guozhen to accompany him. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until around 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Italian Envoy Will Also Host Banquet for Zhang</h3>
<p>The Italian Minister to China, Mr. Boscarelli, visited Mr. Zhang yesterday morning, leaving after about 20 minutes of conversation. The aviation counselor of the Italian embassy will also visit Mr. Zhang today for talks. According to sources from the Italian embassy, the Italian envoy and Mr. Zhang met in Italy and have a very close friendship, so they will host a banquet for Mr. Zhang in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Zhang Releases Written Statement</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang released a written statement yesterday afternoon. The original text is as follows: "I have been troubled by the media's inquiries for days, asking me to make a statement. I do not know that I have been abroad and back for a total of eight months and seventeen days. I am very unfamiliar with the domestic situation. Today, I can only share my travel experiences with you. The places I have traveled to include Italy, Switzerland, Germany, France, England, Denmark, and Sweden. I spent the longest time in Italy. The deepest impression I have is, of course, their material civilization and the utilization of resources, various constructions. However, after a deeper layer of pursuit from the surface, it is truly very moving.</p>
<h3>Supporting Leaders and Experimenting with Doctrines</h3>
<p>One feeling is the enthusiasm of their people in supporting their leaders, which allows their leaders to act freely. Italy and Germany are both countries that were devastated after the war. Mussolini accomplished the great task of changing the world, and Hitler created the great achievement of resurrection. This is due to the leaders' loyalty, selflessness, and efforts in struggling, but it is also due to the people's enthusiastic support. Looking back at our country, there are too many people who want to be leaders, competing with each other. If a leader has the potential to succeed, there will inevitably be obstacles, causing them to fail. Therefore, I feel that the first fatal illness of the Chinese people is that they can neither command nor obey orders, resulting in a lack of organization and difficulty in uniting. As a result, they would rather be strongly oppressed by foreigners than allow their own brothers to rule. To this day, the country is not a country, and it does not even have the ability to defend itself. If the people of the whole country do not want to be slaves, they must have a great realization and correct this weakness. They must allow a leader the opportunity to experiment and support a doctrine to develop its effectiveness. Then China can become an organized country and avoid the calamity of eternal sinking.</p>
<h3>Implementing Refreshed Talent Education</h3>
<p>Another feeling is the dedication of Western scholars to their studies. I visited many academic institutions and interviewed many experts. I saw that they truly dedicate their lives to scholarship. Their college students study diligently with the spirit of grinding an iron inkstone. This is unlike many Chinese universities that are unworthy of their name. Some teachers teach purely for money, and some students study purely for diplomas. Sometimes, they receive money without teaching and obtain diplomas without studying. Their contribution to the country is nothing more than waving flags and shouting slogans, trying to overthrow imperialism with slogans. As a result, the universities are not preparing the talents that the country truly needs for construction. The universities produce a large number of graduates that society cannot place, resulting in people not being able to find the right job, and everyone being unemployed. They all tend to exploit and plunder, leading to political corruption, economic bankruptcy, and social unrest. Talent education is, after all, the starting point for saving the country. It must be refreshed jointly by all those involved in education throughout the country.</p>
<h3>Preparing for a Second World War</h3>
<p>Another feeling is the strong war preparation mentality of Westerners. Their mentality is truly evolving in a process of daily contradictions. They hate war and fear it to the extreme, but they are also preparing for war with extreme urgency. The distrust between countries is even more dangerous than on the eve of the Great War. Economic conferences are not successful, disarmament conferences cannot be held, and the foundation of the League of Nations is shaking. All of these are precursors to the disaster of war. It can be said that it is all a reflection of the international instability in the Orient. The bombs are buried, and when and where they will explode depends on the control of fate. However, looking back at the mentality of the Chinese people, it is as if they are gloating over the disaster, as if China will have a solution if a world war breaks out. In fact, if we do not prepare now, once a world war breaks out, we will not only have no solution, but we will probably be completely destroyed. Because at that time, for strategic and resource reasons, the enemy will occupy important areas of our country and drive our people to obey them. If the situation in our country continues as it is now, we will not even be able to talk about self-defense, let alone have the qualifications to participate in the war. As a result, there will only be a total collapse. Regardless of the outcome of the war, our country will perish. Therefore, the people of the country should have a great realization, eliminate all grievances, quickly stop internal strife, and prepare for the future disaster. The above feelings are the ones that have stimulated me the most and that I want to express quickly.</p>
<h3>The Reason for Returning Home is Exceptionally Pure</h3>
<p>As for my return to China, there are many speculations from the outside world. The reason is actually exceptionally simple. First, I am a tired bird returning to the forest. After living abroad for a long time, I am constantly stimulated, and my heart is burning like fire. I wish I could turn into a fine bird and fly back immediately to persuade the people of the country to truly achieve the four words "sincere unity" and cure this disaster-ridden country tomorrow. Second, I left the country in a hurry, and many family and personal matters have not been settled. I have to sort them out. Third, there are too many refugees and unemployed people in the Northeast. They keep writing to me. I feel really sad when I hear about their plight and am eager to come back and discuss a fundamental relief plan with the government.</p>
<h3>Future Actions Will Obey Government Orders</h3>
<p>As for whether I will work, I am a soldier and can only obey orders. If the country has a place for me, I will dare not slack off if I think I can handle it. If I think I cannot handle it, I will dare not make another mistake. My consistent aspiration is to maintain peace, promote unity, and move towards the path of production and construction. If my aspirations cannot be realized, I plan to go abroad again to investigate and research.</p>

<h3>What Fujian Merchants Heard After Taking Xiamen</h3>
<p>Families of Chen and Others Fled</p>
<p>Fujian Army Supplies Transported to Zhangzhou</p>
<p>Xinxin News Agency reports that according to the Fujian merchants in this port, a telegram was received from Xiamen yesterday. Here is a record of it:</p>
<h3>Families Flee</h3>
<p>1. The families of Chen Mingshu and his senior military officers are currently fleeing in three places (Xiamen) (Gulangyu) (Hong Kong). It is rumored that the Fujian army is determined to make a desperate gamble.</p>
<p>2. Today, it is rumored in Xiamen that Chen Mingshu is quite frustrated because the Fujian army's situation is gone and that he plans to go abroad for inspection.</p>
<h3>Dai Will Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>3. Dai Ji has now fled from Fujian to Hong Kong and plans to go to Shanghai in the near future. When Dai was in Fujian, he never participated in any meetings of the puppet organization.</p>
<h3>Receiving Agencies</h3>
<p>4. After the Central Navy recovered Xiamen, all agencies in Xiamen are now being taken over by the Navy in sequence. The Blue Sky White Sun flag is flying all over the city, and the people are cheering.</p>
<h3>Supplies Transported to Zhang</h3>
<p>5. The Fujian army is now in a critical situation in Fuzhou and is transporting all supplies to Zhangzhou overnight to prevent unexpected events.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Chinese Tea Transported to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Last year, the goods transported by the Soviet Union to China were mainly timber and kerosene. Some coal, fish, and cloth were also occasionally loaded, but because too much was imported, the goods stored in various godowns in Shanghai could not be sold in a short period of time. Therefore, after October, fewer Russian goods were transported, and the number of Shanghai liners in the Soviet merchant fleet also decreased. Until this month, a large batch of Russian goods was transported from Vladivostok. The goods loaded on the "蘇介吉洛夫" (Transliteration: Su Jie Ji Luo Fu) ship, in addition to a large batch of timber, also included thousands of boxes of cloth, cotton velvet, and foreign cloth. After arriving in Shanghai, unloading began yesterday. Another ship, fully loaded with Russian goods, was ordered by merchants in North China, so it went to Tianjin for unloading and then came to Shanghai to load goods to Russia.</p>
<h3>Tea Bricks Transported to Vladivostok</h3>
<p>The most exported item from China to Russia is tea bricks. Last winter, Russian merchants purchased new tea bricks and previously stored old tea bricks. Because there were no ships to load them, they were stored in Hankou and Shanghai, totaling about 10,000 tons for three months. Now, after the Russian merchants negotiated with the Soviet fleet, they decided to use the "蘇介吉洛夫" (Transliteration: Su Jie Ji Luo Fu) and other two ships to load 7,000 tons of new and old tea bricks to Russia in the coming days, heading to Vladivostok and then transferring to Moscow. The Eastern Railway Office in Shanghai is very busy handling the reporting and loading procedures these days. Loading will begin the day after tomorrow. The value of this shipment of tea bricks to Russia is 3 to 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Port Closure Obstructs Navigation</h3>
<p>The Soviet merchant fleet rents a large number of Chinese ships from Shanghai every year to transport seafood and timber from Vladivostok to the coast of Kamchatka. According to the staff of the Shanghai office, the weather from Vladivostok to Kamchatka is extremely cold and has been frozen for a long time, making navigation impossible. The leased Chinese ships have been gradually terminated and the leases have been terminated temporarily. It is necessary to wait for the thaw in April of this year before it can be passable again. Therefore, the goods currently being transported to Shanghai are all accumulated in Vladivostok. The Soviet fleet temporarily dispatches its own ships to operate on the Shanghai-Vladivostok route. Therefore, the two ships that arrived in Shanghai this time are all flying the Soviet flag. The leasing of Chinese ships will be negotiated in mid-March.</p>
<h3>Freight Transport to North China</h3>
<p>In recent months, the sales of Soviet goods have gradually shifted from south to north. The demand for Russian goods in North China seems to be greater than in South China. The Soviet fleet currently has several chartered ships that regularly sail between Vladivostok and Qingdao and Tianjin. At least two ships sail every month, and the goods they carry are always fully loaded.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Fujian Telegrams are Still Not Smooth</h3>
<p>Due to Significant Damage from the War</p>
<p>It is Difficult to Repair for a While</p>
<p>Wired telegrams between Shanghai and Fujian have been interrupted since the outbreak of the war. Only the radio stations in Xiamen and Shantou are used to transmit messages. In order to facilitate communication for merchants, the Ministry of Transportation has set up a telegraph branch in Taishun, Qingyuan, and Jining in Zhejiang, to send and receive commercial telegrams. The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau has also begun to send and receive telegrams. Although Yanping, Gutian, and Shuikou in Fujian have been recovered, due to military reasons, many of the telegraph lines have been damaged. Repairs will take time, so wired telegrams to the above locations are currently unable to operate as usual.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Came to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Visited Zhang Xueliang and Had a Long Conversation</p>
<p>Had Contact with the Financial Community</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 7:30 AM by overnight train from Nanjing and went straight to his private residence on Avenue des Soeurs for rest. At 10:00 AM, he drove to No. 2 Route Molliere to visit Mr. Zhang Xueliang, who had just returned from Europe, and had a pleasant conversation for an hour before taking his leave. Reporters from various newspapers asked Mr. Kong about various financial issues yesterday, but Mr. Kong did not express anything. It is reported that Mr. Kong came to Shanghai this time to have some contact with the financial community and will return to Nanjing next week.</p>
<h3>Direct Communication Between China and Poland</h3>
<p>The Chiri Lus (Transliteration: Xi Li Lu Si) Postal Ship Arrived in Shanghai for the First Time Yesterday</p>
<p>Gdynia Will Be a Polish Transit Port</p>
<p>According to the "字林報" (North China Daily News), the Blue Funnel Line's postal ship "希里魯斯" (Transliteration: Xi Li Lu Si) arrived in this port today (the 11th) from the Polish port of Gdynia. This is actually the first direct voyage between Chinese and Polish ports. Those who are not directly related to shipping may take this lightly, but the general trading houses that trade with the northwest European countries attach great importance to this move. "希里魯斯" (Transliteration: Xi Li Lu Si) left Gdynia on November 25th, passing through Hamburg, Rotterdam, Marseille, Penang, Swettenham, Singapore, Shanghai, Dalian, Moji, and Kobe. It is currently scheduled as a weekly service and will be maintained by the Blue Funnel Line and Ellerman &amp; Bucknall Steamship Co.. The next ship to arrive in Shanghai is the "巴斯城" (Transliteration: Ba Si Cheng), which left Gdynia on December 16th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on February 3rd. In the past, the transportation of commercial goods between Northwest Europe and the Far East always used Hamburg or Rotterdam as the European terminal. Therefore, goods from Riga and other major ports on the Baltic Sea that wanted to be transported to the Far East had to be transported to these two places first. From now on, they only need to be transported to Gdynia. Therefore, Gdynia will become the transit center of the eastern ports of Poland.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Have Almost All Closed Down</h3>
<p>Heavily Affected by Japanese Silk Dumping</p>
<p>Only Five are Currently Operating</p>
<p>Rural Bankruptcy and Worker Unemployment</p>
<p>China's silk industry relies heavily on foreign trade. In the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic of China, Japanese silk merchants, subsidized by the Japanese government, dumped a large amount of stockpiled silk into the European and American markets, with particularly low prices. As a result, Chinese silk was severely hit and prices fell sharply. B-grade silk fell from 1,000 taels per dan to 600 taels. In the autumn of last year, Japanese silk dumping was even more severe, causing Chinese silk to fall from 900 yuan per dan to 500 yuan, with no transactions. Silk merchants suffered huge losses and were unable to maintain operations, teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>After being affected by the dumping, Chinese silk merchants reduced the daily wages of female workers from 50 cents to 45 cents in the early autumn of last year in order to maintain the status quo. However, because Chinese silk still did not improve in the European and American markets and market prices continued to fall, they had to temporarily suspend operations to wait for an opportunity. By the end of October last year, only 13 of the 113 single and double palace silk factories in this city, including Baotai and Fulunheng, were勉强 (barely) maintaining operations.</p>
<h3>Factories Shut Down</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the Shanghai market price of Chinese silk for export has been 500 yuan per dan for B-grade, and 540 yuan per dan for domestic silk mills. However, there are only market prices for exports, but no transactions. Domestic users, because the silk weaving industry has been affected by the dumping of Japanese silk fabrics in the Nanyang Islands, have seen a sharp decline in Chinese silk exports, causing silk mills to be unable to maintain operations and shutting down one after another. According to a survey by a reporter from the Xinxin News Agency, as of yesterday, only five companies in this city are still operating: Baotai No. 2 in Longhua, Baotai No. 1 in Rihui Bridge, Yongheng in Hongkou, and Hengcang in Miaotou.</p>
<h3>Mulberry Fields Converted</h3>
<p>After the sharp drop in Chinese silk prices, when silk merchants purchased fresh cocoons, they tried their best to lower the cocoon prices in order to reduce costs and offset previous losses. Last year, the average price of cocoons in the spring and autumn seasons fell from 50 yuan to 20-30 yuan per dan. Silkworm farmers suffered greatly. The farmers' economies are all impoverished. Most of the funds required for silkworm breeding are borrowed at high interest rates. Therefore, they cannot repay the loans. There are many tragedies that occurred in farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang due to the failure of silkworm breeding. At the same time, farmers, realizing that there is no profit to be made from silkworm breeding, often converted mulberry fields to grow other agricultural products, resulting in a decrease in mulberry fields. In Jiangsu Province, the area of mulberry fields in the 19th year of the Republic of China was 251,000 mu. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, it had been reduced to 84,000 mu. It is expected that it will be reduced even more last year and this year.</p>
<h3>Cocoon Production Decreases</h3>
<p>After the area of mulberry fields is reduced, the amount of silkworm cocoon production will inevitably decrease sharply. For example, Jiangsu Province used to produce 150,000 dan of dried cocoons every year, which is equivalent to about 450,000 dan of fresh cocoons. Zhejiang Province produced 100,000 dan of dried cocoons, which is equivalent to about 300,000 dan of fresh cocoons. However, last year, Jiangsu Province only produced 230,000 dan of fresh cocoons, and Zhejiang Province only produced 100,000 dan of fresh cocoons, which is a large decrease compared to the previous year's output. The most important reason for the decline of rural areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is actually the failure of silkworm breeding.</p>
<h3>Government Relief</h3>
<p>After the silk industry plummeted, it had a significant impact on the rural economy. The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, as well as the Ministries of Industry and Finance, issued the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds in the 20th year of the Republic of China and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Short-Term Public Bonds in the 21st year of the Republic of China for the sake of relief. However, because Chinese silk was too severely affected by Japanese silk dumping, it was of no avail. Recently, the unemployed workers of silk factories in this city have jointly requested the party and government organs for relief, guaranteed by the trade union. It is reported that the party and government organs have reported the situation to the Ministry of Industry to find a solution.</p>
<h3>Du Xigui's Funeral to be Held the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Admiral Du Xigui, after his passing, was encoffined at the International Funeral Parlor. It has now been decided that his funeral will be held the day after tomorrow (the 14th) in the afternoon.

<h3>Chen Shaokuan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Transferring to Wusong to Go to Fujian</h3>
<p>Ministerial Affairs Handled by Li Shijia in His Absence</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Beijing at 8 AM yesterday morning. Because he had his own car, the chauffeur was dispatched to the North Station to meet him, but the car was damaged in a collision on Suzhou Road. Therefore, at 8:10 AM, he transferred to the car of Chen Xunyong, commander of the Training Fleet, and rushed to Yang's residence on Yidingpan Road to pay respects to Yang Shuzhuang. He then went to Wusong, transferred to a small boat from the Ninghai warship, and boarded the ship, departing from Wusong at 9:27 AM, heading directly to Mawei. Few people knew about Chen's departure in advance, so only Chen Xunyong, commander of the Training Fleet, saw him off at Wusong. Only one attendant accompanied him. The escorting warships included the Yingrui, Jiangyuan, and Chuguan, a total of three ships, and they are expected to arrive in Mawei at 3 AM this morning. According to Chen's statement to a Huadong News Agency reporter, he is going to Fujian to meet with Commander Chen Jiliang, and may also make a trip to Xiamen. He expects to return to Shanghai in about a week. During his absence from Beijing, ministerial affairs will be temporarily handled by Vice Minister Li Shijia. As for the shipyard's duties, they will be overseen by Deputy Director Chen Zaofan.</p>

<h3>Another Pillar of the Navy Has Fallen: Yang Shuzhuang Passed Away the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Remains Sent to the International Funeral Parlor for Encoffinment on the 14th</p>
<p>Passed Away at the Age of 52, Leaving Behind One Son and Two Daughters</p>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang, the retired former Minister of the the Navy, who resided in Shanghai, recently suffered a severe relapse of lung disease. Despite medical treatment, he passed away at 10 PM the night before last at his residence at No. 78 Yidingpan Road in western Shanghai. He was 52 years old and left behind one son and two daughters. His remains were transported to the International Funeral Parlor on Rue Say Zoong at 8 AM yesterday morning. The Yang residence has scheduled the encoffinment for 10 AM on the 14th. After Yang's death, telegrams were sent to the central government and relatives and friends in various locations yesterday morning. Minister Chen Shaokuan personally went to pay his respects before his departure yesterday morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Lung Disease Worsens</h3>
<p>Yang was usually very robust, but he suffered from diabetes. After undergoing medical treatment for some time, he had recovered last year. However, on October 10th last year, when the National Games were held in the capital, Yang suddenly suffered a relapse of lung disease after returning to Shanghai from attending the games. Initially, it was just a slight cough, but it gradually worsened. He first consulted Wang Xiaoshu, a Chinese medicine practitioner and staff officer of the Ministry of the Navy, but the medicine was ineffective. He then consulted Dr. Mi and Dr. Bu of the Shanghai Sanitarium, both lung disease specialists. After a long period of treatment, there was still no improvement. He then returned home, where the two doctors continued to visit and treat him daily. However, an X-ray examination revealed that Yang's lungs were swollen and in the third stage. About a week ago, he was unable to sleep at night and his energy was greatly depleted.</p>
<h3>Passed Away the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>At 12 PM the day before yesterday, his condition suddenly worsened. He slept soundly in the afternoon, lasting for five hours, which had never happened since his lung disease relapsed. After waking up, Yang still called his confidant, Shen Jikui, to his bedside to inquire about the situation in Fujian, showing his concern for his hometown even in his serious condition. Shen then withdrew, and it was immediately heard that Yang continued to cough violently, intermittently. At 10 PM in the evening, he fell into a coma and passed away. After the Fujian Incident, Yang had gone to Ganzhou to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss the Fujian situation. Just a week ago, he had gone to pay his respects to Admiral Du Xigui. Unexpectedly, not long after, Yang also passed away. Another pillar of the navy has fallen.</p>
<h3>Encoffinment the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>After Yang's death, Chen Xunyong, commander of the Training Fleet of the Ministry of the Navy, who happened to be stationed in Shanghai, received notification from the Yang residence and rushed to Yang's residence at 12 PM to help with the funeral arrangements. Yang's remains were transported to the International Funeral Parlor on Rue Say Zoong at 8 AM yesterday morning. His family also went to the parlor to mourn. The Yang residence has scheduled the encoffinment for 10 AM on the 14th of this month.</p>
<h3>Chen's Condolences</h3>
<p>After receiving the telegram the night before last, Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan took a train from Beijing to Shanghai yesterday morning. After 7 AM, he went to the Yang residence to personally pay his respects and express his condolences. After a brief condolence visit, he departed for Fujian on the Ninghai warship at about 8 AM. Deputy Minister Li Shijia also personally went to pay his respects yesterday morning. Furthermore, the Yang residence sent out obituaries to the central government and various relatives and friends yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Circumstances After Death</h3>
<p>Yang held important positions in the navy for more than ten years. His first wife had passed away long ago. He left behind two concubines, one son, and two daughters. The eldest son, named Zhihong, courtesy name Guisen, is currently 16 years old and studying in London. A telegram has been sent to urge him to return. The eldest daughter, named Lingyu, is 20 years old and unmarried. The youngest daughter, named Xiaozhen, is 15 years old and currently studying at McTyeire School.</p>
<h3>Yang's Brief Biography</h3>

Chen Shaokuan also sent a telegram to express his condolences.</p>

<h3>Civil Aviation Competes to Increase Joint Transportation; Revival of Shipping in Dabu Port</h3>
<p>Price Reductions Compete for Passengers and Cargo</p>
<p>Rising Water Levels in Dabu Harbor</p>
<p>After the Longhai Railway Bureau and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company jointly handled water-land transportation, it provoked fierce competition from civil aviation. After the opening of navigation in Laoyao, the various civil aviation companies in Dabu Port were initially very worried, deeply concerned that commercial cargo would be cut off and business would be affected. Unexpectedly, things turned out differently than expected. The cargo transportation in Dabu Port has recently become more crowded than before the joint transportation. The water level in the port is also deep, and civil aviation ships are fully loaded on each trip. However, freight rates have fallen sharply, and the shipping industry has suffered significant hidden losses. The details of this matter are as follows:</p>
<h3>Customs Brokers Cooperate to Attract Cargo</h3>
<p>The Longhai Railway opened joint transportation services in Laoyao, directly loading cargo from the Northwest, and excluding the 42 customs brokers in Dabu Port. The customs brokers, concerned about their fundamental business interests, actively contacted cargo owners in the Northwest, attracting them to unload at Dabu Port. At the same time, they consulted with various shipping companies in Shanghai, offering the same treatment as joint transportation. All transshipment matters were handled by the customs brokers, who claimed to the Railway Bureau that the cargo was destined for Qingdao, and that it had nothing to do with joint transportation. They actually achieved their goal.</p>
<h3>Shipping Companies Reduce Prices to Compete for Transportation</h3>
<p>The water freight for each ton of cargo in Haizhou was originally set at more than six yuan. After the opening of joint transportation, the railway and shipping companies set the water freight at only three yuan and five jiao per ton. Customers, because of the low price and convenience, competed to load joint transportation ships. Now, the customs brokers in Dabu Port have negotiated with various shipping companies in Shanghai, such as Dazhen and Hezhong, and have also reduced freight rates, adopting the same rate as the railway and shipping companies, also charging three yuan and five jiao per ton. They are enduring the pain of competing to load cargo in order to maintain the shipping industry. However, in reality, they may have to lose money, but they are forced to do so, as they cannot do business otherwise.</p>
<h3>Congestion and Loading of Cargo in Dabu</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this competition, the number of customers specifying delivery to Dabu for goods transported eastward by the Longhai Railway has been increasing daily. The Dazhen Company's Yongping and Yongan ships each carry more than 800 tons of cargo on each trip to Shanghai. The Yongji ship, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carried as much as 1,400 tons. The Hezhong ships are also fully loaded on each trip. The congestion of cargo is greater than in the past. According to people in the shipping industry, with such price reductions and competition, customers are getting real benefits, while the shipping companies are fighting for the interests of the masses, providing a livelihood for thousands of people in Dabu Port, but the companies themselves have little profit to speak of.</p>
<h3>The Water Level in the Harbor is Also Deep</h3>
<p>The sea entrance of Dabu Port is often silted up. In the past, sea ships could only load 400 tons of cargo at that location; any more and they would run aground. Recently, Dabu Port has suddenly changed. The water level in the port has suddenly increased, and there is a draft of 13 feet even at low tide. Therefore, the Yongji can transport 1,400 tons of cargo and sail safely. The reporter also inquired with Dazhen Company about the civil aviation's participation in joint transportation. According to the company, this matter still needs to be approved by the ministry, and a joint office for joint transportation will be organized before discussing the distribution of ships for transportation. Before it is realized, the civil aviation companies will operate as they are now.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation's Trial Flight Aircraft Detained, French Minister Cables Permission for Return</h3>
<p>Instructed the Governor of Annam to Certify and Return</p>
<p>Expected to Fly into Annamese Territory Today</p>
<p>According to the Fuxing News Agency, the aircraft of the China National Aviation Corporation, which was conducting trial flights in the Southwest, was forced to land in Ke Fang, French Annam, due to weather conditions and was detained by the French authorities. The pilot, An Lisen, and the aviation director, Nie Kaiyi, telegraphed from Hanoi to report to the Shanghai company. The Shanghai company immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Transportation to report and request certification. The Ministry of Transportation also consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which in turn contacted the French Minister to China to request certification for return. It is now learned that the company has received a telegram from the Ministry of Transportation stating that the French Minister has replied, agreeing to immediately inform the Governor of Annam to certify that it is a Chinese civilian aircraft and to release it immediately. Therefore, it is expected that it will be able to fly out of Ke Fang today (the 12th), pass through Longzhou, arrive in Yunnan, transfer to Chongqing, and return to Shanghai along the river.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Movement by Residents in the Second Special District</h3>
<p>More Than Thirty Representatives Attended the Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Three Representatives Elected to Negotiate with the Citizens' Association</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the city's commerce has been greatly affected, and the occurrence of the Fujian Incident has further depressed the market. As a result, the general public is facing great difficulties in their livelihood. Low- and middle-income residents feel that it is not easy to live in Shanghai. Therefore, Wu Xiu and others, residents of the French Concession, invited representatives of residents and tenants of the French Concession at 2 PM yesterday afternoon to hold a joint meeting to launch a rent reduction movement. Attendees included Wu Xiu of Huayuanfang, Huang E of Xinlingcun, Wang Longzhang of Puqingli, Zhu Xiaochun of Chengyuli, Du Mengsen of Xinxinli, Lai Zhiwen of Rongrenli, Li Ruzhang of Xichengli, Wang Guoping of Jianyeli, Gui Yuankang of Cishouli, Zhu Renqu of Fengyuli, and Chen Zhizhao of Xihufang, totaling more than thirty representatives. Huang E was the chairman and Wang Longzhang was the recorder. The main issues discussed were: 1) Preparing to organize the Shanghai Second Special District Rent Reduction Movement Committee. It was decided to start organizing immediately. 2) Issuing a rent reduction declaration. It was decided to have Wang Guoping draft it. 3) Electing representatives to negotiate with the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' United Association on the rent reduction movement. It was decided to elect Wang Longzhang, Huang E, and Zhu Xiaochun as representatives to go. 4) Determining the location of the preparatory office. It was decided to temporarily use No. 434 Route Tenant de la Tour. (The rest omitted.) The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Jin Xi's Family Invited Various French Groups Yesterday</h3>
<p>Launched the Formation of a Support Association and Jointly Telegraphed the French President, etc.</p>
<p>Went to the Municipal Government and French Consulate Separately This Morning to Petition</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Chen Yang, Li Shichang, representatives of Jin Xi's family, and lawyers Lou Yunmei, Xu Jie, Zhou Xiaobo, and Luo Zhaoxin invited various French groups in Shanghai to a reception at the China News Agency on Weihaiwei Road at 2 PM yesterday. Attendees included more than ten organizations such as the Municipal Education Association, the General Labor Union, the Lawyers Association, the University Students' Federation, the Middle School Students' Federation, the Ningbo Native Association, the First Special District Citizens' Federation, and the Municipal Farmers' Association. The family representatives, Chen and Li, reported on the two arrests, followed by the lawyers Lou, Xu, and Zhou explaining the negotiation process and the legal perspective of the case, and offering suggestions for future negotiations. Representatives from various organizations present, Zhu Xuefan, Wang Weizhen, Huang Zhaoxiong, Cao Zhigong, and Dong Xinqin, proposed launching the Jin Xi Case Support Association. Considering that this case is of great importance to national sovereignty, it was decided to jointly telegraph the French President and the Paris Human Rights Protection League, and to go to the Municipal Government and the French Consulate separately at 10 AM today to petition for negotiation. The text of the telegram to the French President and the Paris Human Rights Protection League is as follows: (Telegram to President Doumergue) To His Excellency the President of the Republic of France, In the matter of Mr. Jin Xi, a Korean who naturalized as a Chinese citizen long ago and has resided in the French Concession for many years, he was suddenly illegally arrested in the French Concession on November 22, 1933, by the French Concession Police, in collusion with the Japanese police, and handed over to the Japanese Consulate for detention. Although a certificate of nationality was presented to the French Consulate in Shanghai for negotiation in accordance with the law, he has not been released. China and France have always maintained friendly relations. Now, the French Consulate in Shanghai has illegally assisted in the arrest of Jin Xi, which violates the judicial agreement of the Concession, greatly alarming the residents of the Concession and arousing public outrage. I urge Your Excellency the President to consider the friendly relations between the two countries and immediately telegraph Consul General Meyrier to be responsible to the Japanese Consul for his return. I am extremely grateful. (Telegram to the Paris Human Rights Protection League) To the Paris Human Rights Protection League, Mr. Jin Xi, a member of the Korean nationalist organization, became a Chinese citizen in 1929 along with his father, Jin Yongduo. In November 1932, Jin Xi and his father were illegally arrested by the Japanese police in the French Concession. After serious negotiations by the Chinese and French authorities based on their naturalized citizenship, they were released. Unexpectedly, on November 22 of this year, Jin Xi was again arrested in the French Concession by the French Police in collusion with the Japanese police and directly handed over to the Japanese Consulate for detention. Despite the best efforts of the Shanghai Municipal Government and various French organizations to negotiate, he has not been released. I sincerely request that your League, based on its great authority to protect human rights, raise public opinion and urge your government and various French organizations to pay attention, and send a letter or telegram to Consul General Meyrier in Shanghai, lodging a strong protest with the Japanese Consul, and sending Jin Xi back as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Note to Japanese Minister Requesting the Relocation of Residents in Fujian and Xiamen</h3>
<p>Japanese Minister Replies with Excuses and Intentional Delay</p>
<p>While Requesting the National Government to Take Effective Measures Quickly</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Central Government's campaign to suppress the rebels in Fujian has achieved successive victories in recent days. According to the Ministry of the Navy, Xiamen has already been recovered, and the army and air force are also pursuing the defeated troops of the rebels, hoping to wipe them out in one fell swoop. Fuzhou is expected to fall soon. Currently, only the issue of foreign residents remains unresolved. After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent notes to the ministers of various countries, ordering foreign residents to evacuate Fuzhou and Xiamen, the ministers of Great Britain and the United States issued replies to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and then instructed the consuls stationed in Fuzhou and Xiamen to make appropriate relocations. However, Minister Ariyoshi of Japan, after receiving a note from Foreign Minister Wang Jingwei on the 29th of last month requesting the relocation of Japanese residents in Fuzhou and Xiamen, and Taiwanese residents on Gulangyu, replied on the 9th, stating that the Japanese government felt it was difficult to relocate due to all its rights and interests, and requested that the National Government take effective measures. At the same time, he telegraphed the Japanese consuls in Fuzhou and Xiamen, giving the same reply to the Foreign Ministry of the puppet People's Government. The contents of the exchange of letters between Foreign Minister Wang Jingwei and Minister Ariyoshi are as follows:</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang's Letter</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang's letter to Minister Ariyoshi on the 12th stated that the National Government's military action against Fujian was solely for the purpose of expelling the rebels. When necessary, in order to ensure the safety of foreign nationals residing and traveling in Fujian Province, please have your nationals residing in the Fuzhou area temporarily evacuate to Nantai, and those in the Xiamen area relocate to Gulangyu to avoid danger and avoid damage.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister's Letter</h3>
<p>Minister Ariyoshi's reply stated that the Imperial Government not only has significant treaty rights and interests in Fujian, but also has a large number of residents living there. The Imperial Government has repeatedly stated during the Fujian Incident that as long as it does not harm the interests of the Empire and the lives and property of the residents, it will strictly adhere to a policy of non-interference. A large number of Japanese residents live in Fuzhou and Xiamen. It was originally planned to relocate as many as possible to Nantai to take refuge, but it is not only difficult to accommodate all of them, but also there are about 20,000 residents in Xiamen, and it is practically impossible to relocate all of them to Gulangyu. The property left behind by the residents is also very large, so it is hoped that the National Government will take effective measures.</p>
<h3>Anniversary of the Joint Reserve Committee and the Clearing House</h3>
<p>Zhu Boquan Reports on One Year of Achievements</p>
<p>The Clearing House established by the Joint Reserve Committee of the Shanghai Banking Association opened on January 10th of last year. The day before yesterday marked the first anniversary of the establishment of the Clearing House. In the evening, a banquet was held at the Hongkou Apartment Restaurant to celebrate with all the colleagues of the Clearing House. About 200 people attended, including representatives of 36 banks and clearing members. During the banquet, Mr. Zhu Boquan, the manager of the committee, gave a sincere speech on the achievements of the past year and the future facilities and improvements. Zhu then addressed the representatives of the four new clearing banks, namely Chunghui, Quangong, Qiye, and Hengli, welcoming them and introducing Mr. Xu Baoqi, the newly appointed deputy manager of the committee. After the banquet, there was also a lottery. Various valuable stationery and books and magazines were presented to the public. Colleagues from various banks rarely have the opportunity to socialize. The joyous gathering was a great success.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhu's Speech</h3>
<p>The proposal to establish a clearing house by the Shanghai banking community dates back more than ten years. Plans were made no less than four or five times, but they failed to materialize due to various obstacles. It was not until this day last year that this difficult-to-give-birth clearing house was safely born. Thanks to the concerted efforts of all the clearing members, it has developed repeatedly and the atmosphere has been completely renewed in the past year. As the clearing house celebrates its first anniversary, we should first express our deep gratitude to all colleagues for their hard work over the past year. Speaking of the achievements of the past year, the total amount of clearing for the whole year was 200 million, and there were more than 900,000 bills. This large amount of interbank funds previously required people to collect them separately, but now they are concentrated in the clearing house for settlement. The labor and expenses saved, as well as the security and convenience, can be imagined. Also, before the clearing house was established, interbank collections and settlements, according to the customs of the Qianye industry, charged bill fees. A single fee was 7 fen per thousand yuan, and a double fee was 1 jiao 4 fen. Usually, the double fee was more common, which was quite wasteful. Last year, the expenses of the clearing house were apportioned based on the total amount of exchange bills received and paid. The expenses for each exchange bill amount of 1,000 yuan were only 1 li and 1 hao (2 li and 2 hao for a single party), which is five or six times less than before. The establishment of the clearing house is solely for the purpose of serving the banking industry. It has only been operating for a year, and I am confident that the service performance will definitely improve year by year, and it will not be limited to the above-mentioned aspects. You are the pioneers of this new undertaking. If you want to promote and develop it, you should still work together and unite unremittingly in the constructive, active, and progressive aspects. I hope that you will continue to work hard in the future, so as to achieve the purpose of the clearing house fully serving the banking industry. I am not talented, but I am willing to work with you to encourage each other.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Headquarters Began Relocating Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Propaganda, Investigation, and Statistics Departments Have Completed the Relocation</p>

It is now learned that the Propaganda, Investigation, and Statistics Departments have all moved to the new site yesterday afternoon. A portion of the Organization Department has also moved, and is currently being arranged and organized. The remaining portion of the Organization Department will be moved this morning. The General Affairs and Civil Movement Departments are scheduled to move at the same time tomorrow. Starting from the 15th (Monday), all departments will be able to work at the new site.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Held a Board Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Submitted the Cost of Seaships to the Ministry for Instructions</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company held its 56th board meeting at 4 PM yesterday. Attendees included Shi Liangcai, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Shouyong, Ye Zhuotang, Liu Hongsheng, and others. General Manager Liu Hongsheng first reported: 1) Sending He Molin, the chief of the business department, to the United States to negotiate the leasing of ships to load American loan cotton and wheat for transportation to China. 2) Using the Boxer Indemnity funds to build river and sea ships, with the cost of the seaships exceeding the budget. 3) Conducting a business inspection in Qingdao, noting that the price of the Puan ship was too high and a separate plan should be made. Then, the discussion of various cases began. Regarding the case of the cost of the seaships exceeding the budget, it was decided to submit it to the Ministry of Transportation for review and approval. There were also several internal cases, and the meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>
<h3>Summary of Labor-Management Dispute Mediation</h3>
<p>Meifeng and Hengfeng Disputes Rescheduled for Mediation</p>
<p>Hongda and Huachang Disputes Declared Resolved</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the bankruptcy situation of the silk industry in Shanghai has been repeatedly reported in various newspapers. In order to protect the industry and safeguard the livelihood of workers, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs specially convened both labor and management from various silk factories yesterday to conduct mediation. In addition, the General Labor Union advised and mediated the dismissal dispute at the Huachang Ganpian Factory. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Meifeng Dispute Rescheduled for Mediation</h3>
<p>The case of the Meifeng Silk Factory on Haizhou Road, which declared bankruptcy due to excessive losses, with the labor side demanding resumption of business without success, causing a dispute, was mediated by the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday. Zhang Yixiang and Zhang Zhizhiquan from the labor side, and Ni Nengchang and Zhang Congxin from the management side, were present. Chairman Zhu Jintao requested that the factory determine a date for resuming work, allow workers to stay in the factory during the suspension period, and provide each worker with 10 yuan for travel expenses, as well as food expenses during the unresolved period. The management expressed disagreement, resulting in no resolution. Finally, the chairman ordered both parties to go back and consider compromise methods, and then reschedule the mediation.</p>
<h3>Hengfeng Dispute to Be Investigated and Rehandled</h3>
<p>The case of the Hengfeng Silk Factory on Pingliang Road, which announced a reduction in wages due to poor business, with the workers expressing opposition, causing a dispute, was also convened by the Bureau for mediation the other day. Regarding the disputed wage reduction issue, both sides had considerable reasons for their statements. In order to protect the industry and safeguard the livelihood of workers, the Bureau plans to conduct a comprehensive survey of silk industry wages before determining a compromise solution.</p>
<h3>Hongda Dispute Declared Resolved</h3>
<p>The Hongda Silk Factory on Julu Road in Nanshi is a leased factory. Recently, due to the expiration of the lease and poor business, it had no intention of continuing business and terminated the lease. The entire workforce submitted a request for assistance from party and government agencies because the wages they deserved had not been paid by the factory. The Bureau mediated the dispute yesterday. After both parties stated the details of the events, a lengthy consultation was held. It was decided that 1) the 25 workers, including Lu Zuguang, would be allowed to be dismissed, and the factory would provide each of them with a subsidy of 5 yuan. 2) If the factory resumes business in the future, it should first use the above-mentioned workers. 3) The workers' wages should be paid immediately. 4) The labor side voluntarily gave up the supplementary yardstick wages. Both parties expressed their agreement, signed the settlement agreement, and declared the resolution.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Dispute Over Layoffs at Huachang</h3>
<p>The Huachang Coir Fiber Factory in Pudong recently experienced sluggish business and reduced its scale. Last December, it laid off more than 30 workers. Government and party organizations convened mediation sessions, but no results were achieved due to the firm attitudes of both parties. Recently, the Early General Labor Union persuaded both sides, and a settlement was reached. Three conditions were signed as follows: First, due to the factory's sluggish business, thirty-two workers, including Sheng Zhenghua (27 male workers and 5 female workers), will be permitted to terminate their relationship with the factory. Second, the factory will provide each laid-off worker with severance pay. Female workers in the coir fiber department will receive 31 yuan each. Workers in the warehouse department will receive 96 yuan each. Workers in the coir processing department with more than eight years of service will receive 150 yuan each, and those with less than eight years of service will receive 140 yuan each. Third, when the factory's business returns to its original state in the future, it should prioritize re-employing the workers laid off this time. With both parties satisfied, the resolution was announced.</p>

<h3>The Cotton Control Association's Investigation Team for North China is Scheduled to Depart on the 15th</h3>
<p>Shanghai Investigation Nears Completion, Continuing to Wuxi</p>
<p>The Distribution and Sales Group's Scope is Extensive, Delaying Departure</p>
<p>Since the Economic Commission's Cotton Control Association decided to first investigate the production and consumption of cotton yarn to compile statistics for improvement, aiming for domestic cotton cloth to achieve self-sufficiency, the investigation of the cotton seed portion has been completed. The yarn and cloth investigation is divided into four regions: East China, North China, Central China, and South China. Except for the South China region, which has not yet organized an investigation team, the Shanghai aspect of the East China region is nearing completion since the investigation began and will depart soon to Wuxi, Nantong, and other locations. The departure date for the North China investigation team has been set for the 15th of this month. Team leader Nie Guangyao will lead more than 20 team members to investigate the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi. However, this team only belongs to the spinning group for yarn and cloth. The dyeing and distribution and sales group for yarn and cloth has a broader scope and a larger region, so its departure will be slightly delayed. Furthermore, the association previously used correspondence to investigate various ports where factories have not been established. Replies have been gradually received and will soon be compiled for reference.</p>
<h3>A Young Man Drowns in the Huangpu River from a Ferry</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 4:30 PM, a young man resembling a merchant, approximately 27 or 28 years old, wearing a long robe and leather shoes, was on a ferry on the Huangpu River at Laobaidu in the Nanshi area. When the ferry was sailing in the center of the Huangpu River, the young man suddenly exited the standing cabin. At that time, a steamer from the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. was passing by, causing the waves in the Huangpu River to surge. The small ferry shook, and the young man standing outside the cabin accidentally fell into the river. Although the crew members glimpsed him and wanted to find a way to rescue him, it was impossible, resulting in him disappearing without a trace. It is unknown whether the young man jumped into the river to commit suicide or accidentally drowned. It is difficult to ascertain.</p>

<h3>The Manager Who Abused Empty Checks to Defraud Goods Was Arrested and Tried</h3>
<p>A Total of More Than 10,900 Yuan Was Defrauded</p>
<p>The Official Adjourned the Debate and Scheduled the Verdict</p>
<p>Guangdong native Guo Wenqing previously opened the Yichang Sock Factory, also operating Huayang general merchandise, opposite the Datzeminzhong on the Avenue Edward VII. The store management was handled entirely by his nephew Guo Zhongfang for several years. Due to the reconstruction of the building, it was moved to No. 213 Zilai Street. Recently, due to poor business, the uncle and nephew colluded last December to defraud various goods from 66 stores, including Sincere Company, Wing On Industrial Company, Liang Xinjie Toothbrush Factory, Guangming Thermos Factory, Huachang Overshoe Factory, and Meiqiu Knitting Factory, worth a total of 10,969.981 yuan. Eighteen of them were paid with bounced checks as a means of deception. The goods were secretly moved to No. 21 Jianye Lane, Fulu Li Road, in the French Concession and secretly sold. On December 19, the store closed down and hired lawyer Wang Kanghou to publish a notice to clear the accounts. By the time the bad checks received by each business matured and could not be collected from the bank or money house, Guo was pursued, but the store was closed, and the person was avoiding meeting. After investigation, the truth was learned. Guo's behavior was actually fraudulent. It was reported to the Chinese and Foreign Sundries Association, and on the 3rd of this month, the French Concession Police Station was requested to investigate. The head of the police approved the request and sent detectives to investigate. Store owner Guo Wenqing was nowhere to be found, and only Guo Zhongfang was arrested. The next day, he was sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu Huanjing interrogated him in the Criminal Court No. 8. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the police's investigation and prosecuted him for fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Code. Representatives of the plaintiffs arrived to state the circumstances of the defendant's fraud and abuse of checks, as well as the circumstances of the discovery, and hired lawyer Zhu Taiqing to request an incidental civil lawsuit to recover the payment for the goods from the defendants. When questioned, the defendant Guo Zhongfang claimed that he was a clerk who only earned 12 yuan a month. All the affairs of the store were managed by the store owner. He was not the manager and did not know about the fraud. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. Next, witnesses Zhang Shengji, Wang Guoyu, Chen Dongchu, and others reported to the court to prove that the defendant was actually the manager of Yichang Sock Factory. They had collected payments from him and could only deal with him after he arrived at the store. Finally, the police lawyer, the plaintiff's lawyer, and the defense lawyer hired by the defendant debated the public and private lawsuits. The court then announced the adjournment of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the 15th. The defendant was not allowed bail and was returned to detention to await instructions.</p>

He then went to Vienna to study aviation at the Army University and practice flying.

<h3>The Opening of the Leprosy Sanatorium Fundraising Conference Was Grand</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech Was Passionate and Inspiring</p>
<p>1,800 Yuan Was Donated on the Spot</p>
<p>The China Leprosy Relief Association held the opening ceremony of the fundraising conference for the construction of the China Leprosy Sanatorium at the Bankers' Association yesterday at 7:00 PM, inviting captains and members of various teams. Those present included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Bureau Chief Li Tingan, Bureau Chief Pan Gongzhan, Lu Bohong, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, He Dekui, Wu Zhihao, Ding Fubao, Zhu Shaoping, Fan Wenzhao, Xu Xinliu, Wang Boqi, Zhu Xingru, Chen Zhifang, Tang Youwei, Zhu Lide, and Lu Ganchen, etc., more than a hundred people. Directors and executives of the association, Zhu Shaoping, Wang Zhiren, Cheng Lian, Yan Fuqing, Wu Zhijian, and Gao Mingqiang, etc., warmly received them. After taking their seats, Chairman Yan Fuqing reported, stating that the proposal to build a leprosy sanatorium in Shanghai has been around for many years, but the appropriate site has been difficult to find, which has delayed the implementation. Recently, a site of more than 100 mu was found at the mouth of the Yangtze River in the city, which is very suitable for this hospital. The construction cost is estimated at more than 100,000 yuan, and there is already 40,000 yuan secured, so only 60,000 yuan is lacking. Given the enthusiasm of the people present today, it will not be difficult to promote its completion. Mayor Wu then gave a speech, vividly describing the cruelty of leprosy and the urgent need for the people of Shanghai to take measures to provide relief. His passionate and inspiring speech moved the audience. Subsequently, Director Li, Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, Lu Bohong, Zhu Shaoping, and Chen Zhifang gave speeches, all stating that this sanatorium is most needed at present, and it is everyone's duty to work hard to raise donations. Finally, Wu Zhijian, the general manager, reported on the organizational overview of the fundraising conference. On the spot, Ding Fubao donated 1,000 yuan, Fei Wusheng donated 500 yuan, and Zhu Shaoping donated 300 yuan. Others, such as Mayor Wu, Director Li, Yuan Ludeng, Lu Bohong, and Chen Zhifang, also pledged large donations. The opening ceremony has already achieved such results, and the satisfactory outcome in the future can be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Subsidizes the National Crisis Propaganda Group's Travel Expenses</h3>
<p>The National Crisis Propaganda Group, Mongolia-Border-Northwest Exhibition, was originally scheduled to depart for the second time today, but due to time constraints, it was decided to postpone the departure to after the 20th of this month. Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city specially presented 500 yuan for travel expenses yesterday. The Ministry of Communications also issued free boat tickets to all seven members of the group, Shen Yiqian, Zhang Yi, Wang Bin, Mo Pu, Yu Chuangshuo, Huang Zhaochang, and Gu Tingpeng, which can be used on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ships. As for trains, it is currently being negotiated with the railway. The group also decided to publish a letter to the elders of the Southeast before departure.</p>
<h3>The Lake Society and Five Other Organizations Commemorate Mr. Zhou Xiangling and His Nephew</h3>

<p>Wu Xing native Mr. Zhou Xiangling and his nephew Mr. Bainian have passed away one after another. The Lake Society and five other organizations from their hometown have scheduled a memorial service at the Lake Society tomorrow (the 13th) at 2:00 PM.

<h3>Fellow Anhui Natives in Shanghai Commemorate Tong Maoqian</h3>
<p>Publicly Discussing Posthumous Title of "Xianwen"</p>
<p>Hefei native Mr. Tong Maoqian, during the Xinhai Revolution, was a guest in Anhui. He visited the local authorities to vigorously explain the advantages and disadvantages, and the Anhui situation was stabilized. He was jointly recommended to be the Civil Affairs Director, but he declined. His ambition was quiet and indifferent, but he was brave in doing what was right. He was almost what the ancients called a Confucian scholar and a knight. He once taught at Shuntian Middle School, served as the president of the Anhui Education Association, and founded Zhengyi Middle School in Hefei. He also donated funds to his village to run a clan school for many years. He was eager to nurture younger generations. He suddenly returned to the mountains, and people from far and near mourned him together. Therefore, Anhui natives in Shanghai held a public memorial service at the Qingliang Temple in Shanghai on the 7th of this month. Those present included fellow Anhui natives in Shanghai Xu Shiying, Wang Dizhai, Chen Ziyan, Li Mugong, Guan Jianfan, Liu Quanzhuang, Gao Yinzhao, Li Shaochuan, and Huang Bodu, etc., fellow Anhui natives in Shanghai Li Boqi and Zhang Fuqing, etc., fellow Wuhu natives Yuan Xiankui and Wang Delin, etc., and scholar Tan Shengyi, who had just returned from England. It was an extremely grand event. Xu Shiying was publicly elected to chair the memorial service, and as there were cases of changing names in the stories of sages, it was publicly discussed that the posthumous title should be Mr. Xianwen.</p>
<h3>Sanbei Shipping Company's Newly Established Shanghai-Qingdao Route, China Merchants Bureau's Puan Steamer Reduces Prices</h3>
<p>Jing'an Steamer Makes its Inaugural Voyage to Qingdao on Sunday</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, the General Manager of the state-run China Merchants Bureau, has returned to Shanghai from an inspection tour of Qingdao. He found that the original prices for passenger tickets on the Puan steamer, which travels the Shanghai-Qingdao route, were not entirely suitable. He has re-established new ticket prices: first class special is 40 yuan one-way, 70 yuan round-trip; first class is 20 yuan one-way, 36 yuan round-trip; cabin class is 12 yuan one-way, no round-trip tickets available; and steerage class is 6 yuan one-way, no round-trip tickets available. Except for first class special which is provided with Western cuisine, all other classes are provided with Chinese cuisine. These prices will be implemented starting today when the Puan steamer departs for Qingdao. All ticket prices have been reduced compared to the previous prices. Furthermore, Yu Qiaqing of the Sanbei Shipping Company, recognizing that the China Merchants Bureau's Puan steamer is the only Chinese-owned steamer with scheduled services on the Shanghai-Qingdao route, specially purchased the Qing'an steamer from the Navy Department and had it repaired and converted into a commercial vessel. Additional passenger capacity has been added, and the vessel was completed and made its inaugural voyage on the Shanghai-Qingdao route yesterday.</p>
<h3>Request for Flexible Reporting Procedures for Medicinal Saltpeter and Sulfur</h3>
<p>A letter from the New Pharmaceutical Association to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce states: When the weight of saltpeter and sulfur is within two dan, customs commissioners can use discretion to allow release of items, based on reports from reliable merchants that it is for industrial or medicinal use. The current Jianghai Customs announcement states that, according to ministry orders, regardless of the quantity, transport within the province only requires verification of the Ministry of Finance's internal saltpeter and sulfur transportation permit for release. Transport outside the province requires presenting a passport from the National Government and the Ministry of Finance's external saltpeter and sulfur transportation permit for release. However, the saltpeter and sulfur, and saltpeter/sulfur categories, used in medicine include a wide variety of items such as Chilean nitrate, calcium nitrate, Chilean nitrate special calcium nitrate, strong nitric acid, petroleum jelly, picric acid, red phosphorus, white phosphorus, yellow phosphorus, phosphorus nitrate, double phosphorus nitrate, sulfur, refined sulfur, strong nitric acid, and toluene. Quantities are very small. Schools, hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, and military doctors in other locations typically purchase no more than one or two pounds at a time from Shanghai. If transport to other locations requires presenting a passport and obtaining a transportation permit for release, the procedures are cumbersome and extremely difficult to complete. The association requests that the Ministry of Finance adopt the old procedures and implement flexible handling to alleviate merchants' difficulties. We have learned that the association's statements accurately reflect the situation and have agreed to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chinese Woolen Fabric Manufacturers Association Held Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Resolution to Request Thorough Investigation of the Woolen Fabric Manufacturers Association Re-election Case</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Woolen Fabric Manufacturers Association held an Executive Committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Committee members Chen Youyun, Xu Jutang, and others were present. Gu Jiuru chaired the meeting, and the meeting began with formalities. The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that recently some industry members have blindly followed one or two unscrupulous individuals to organize another Woolen Fabric Manufacturers Association, which violates the law that one industry cannot have two associations and obstructs the industry's business. Although an announcement was published in the newspaper the day before yesterday to inform various sectors, it is now necessary to discuss how to deal with the case. Resolutions: (A) Submit a request to higher authorities for a thorough and strict investigation. (B) Notify all industry members not to be deceived by this illegal organization. (C) Confidential.

<h3>Summation in the Kidnapping Case of Sun Yushun's Young Son</h3>
<p>The Young Hostage Has Already Died from Illness</p>
<p>All Suspects Remain in Custody Awaiting Instructions</p>
<p>Sun Yushun (50 years old, from Shaoxing, owner of Sun Shun Ji Silk Weaving Factory) of 53 Run'an Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, had his five-year-old only son, Jiabao, kidnapped after he suddenly disappeared while playing in front of his house at noon on May 20 of last year. Eight letters were received from the post office, demanding 8,000 yuan for ransom. It was discovered that he had been kidnapped by bandits. After sending people to negotiate with the bandits several times without success, the French police learned that Zheng Wenxiang, a tenant of Sun's house from Shaoxing, was a prime suspect. When they went to arrest him, Zheng had already moved his entire family and fled without a trace. Subsequently, Zheng's wife, Zhou, his concubine, Lou, his friend, Qiu Yaoshan, apprentices, Li Ziqing, Min Xinhao, and a woman, Zhou Wenying, a total of six men and women, were arrested at the Far Eastern Hotel on Xizang Road and sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. After interrogation and investigation, several court hearings were held, but the whereabouts of the hostage remained unknown. It was not until November 27 that Jin Jiulin, Chief Inspector of the Special Branch of the French Police, and others arrested the actual kidnapper in the case, Zhang Shuchuan, a resident of Run'an Lane, where the victim lived. Zhang confessed to conspiring with accomplices to kidnap and demand a ransom. He also admitted that the hostage had died of illness. Upon instruction, the case was rescheduled for investigation and further questioning. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Changnian presided over a continued hearing in the First Criminal Court. Zhang Shuchuan's testimony was the same as previously reported and will not be repeated here. Zheng Zhou, Qiu Yaoshan, and others all vehemently protested their innocence, claiming ignorance of the kidnapping and ransom demand. After reviewing the evidence, the court appointed a lawyer to defend Zhang and lawyers, including Jiang Yiping, to defend the other defendants, Zheng Zhou, etc. Attorney Gu Shouxi represented the police department in court. After the lawyers presented their arguments, the court declared the summation complete and adjourned the hearing. The defendants remain in custody awaiting instructions.</p>
<h3>The Case of Human-Dog Relations Is Remanded for Retrial on the Charge</h3>
<p>Victim Requests Severe Punishment in Court</p>
<p>Police Lawyer Requests Upholding the Original Sentence</p>
<p>|Closing Arguments Yesterday, Sentencing on the Afternoon of the 17th|</p>
<p>Chen Xinzhai, a diabolo performer at Tianyun Restaurant in the Yong'an Company, and his concubine, Chen, cohabited at 12 Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road. With the intention of making a profit, they took in four children, Chen Shuanglin, Chen Guilin, Chen Genlin, and Yuncaiyun, with ages ranging from eleven to five years old. They hired a teacher to train them in performing and also kept a black dog. Every night, they took the children to major hotels to perform human-dog sexual acts to make money. This kind of conscienceless and insane act was discovered by Chinese Detective Tang Jian and Detective Yang Feizhang of the Xinzha Police Station on July 20 of the previous year. They arrested Chen Xinzhai and his wife, along with the four young girls and the black dog, and brought them to the First Special Court. In the first trial, Chen and his wife were each sentenced to ten years and two months in prison, the four girls were sent to the Jiliang Institute for care, and the black dog was confiscated. Dissatisfied with the original sentence, Chen and others appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, but the result was still a failure. Chen and others remained unwilling to accept the verdict and filed another appeal to the Supreme Court. After the Supreme Court reviewed the case files in detail, it found that a portion of the case, namely, whether the victims Chen Shuanglin and others had the intention to request criminal penalties against the appellants, met the requirements for filing a charge and other lawful elements of a charge, was not yet fully understood. The case was remanded for retrial. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhao Yitang, along with Judges Jiang and Zhou, presided over the retrial at the Second Branch of the High Court. Because the other parts had already been dismissed by the Supreme Court, only the point of charge was examined. The twelve-year-old Chen Shuanglin and nine-year-old Chen Guilin stated that Chen Xinzhai and his wife were their parents, but neighbors said they were not their biological parents. In the past, they were forced to perform sexual acts with dogs in hotels, which caused them deep hatred. Therefore, they requested that the court severely punish them. Chen Xinzhai and Chen Lu's still denied the charges and asked for leniency. At the end, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin expressed his opinion that Chen's actions were extremely evil, and the evidence in this case was sufficient. The original sentence was without error and should be upheld. Judge Zhao announced that the summation of the case was complete and scheduled sentencing for the afternoon of the 17th.</p>

<h3>The Stamp Tax Bureau Lost a Store's Accounting Books</h3>
<p>Altering Receipts to Shirk Responsibility</p>
<p>Wusong Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Negotiate</p>
<p>Recently, the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau sent personnel to various shops in Wusong to inspect stamps, and took the inspected and found out-of-compliance accounting books and invoices to Shanghai for separate punishments, which were executed by the Seventh District Public Security Bureau of Wusong. Among them, Songxing Hengmao Dyeing Factory, at that time, one cash book and one ledger were taken away. The cash book did not have a seal, and the ledger did not have a stamp. A total fine of 20 yuan was imposed and paid promptly. When they went to the Seventh District to collect it, it turned out that two accounting books were returned, except for the cash book, one ledger was missing, and it was replaced with one from Xinmaochang. At that time, the Seventh District temporarily stored the fine and inquired with the Stamp Tax Bureau. When the Hengmao Dyeing Factory went to collect it for the second time, only one cash book was received, and the 20 yuan on the fine ticket was changed to 10 yuan. The non-stamping item under the violation was also deleted, intending to shirk the responsibility of not losing the transcription ledger. The store thought that the shop's transcription was the general ledger of people owing people, how could it be lost? Therefore, the above situation was sent to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce Office by letter to negotiate with the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau. After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday to strictly negotiate with the Bureau and send back the original book. It is now learned that the Stamp Tax Bureau has sent personnel to Song to request Hengmao to reconcile, but the store refused to agree and must negotiate to recover the lost book.</p>

<h3>Expansion of Ganlu Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company</h3>
<p>The southern section of the Jinpu Railway has a place called Jiashan, which belongs to Anhui Province. In the past, it was a prosperous area with fertile land and well-developed agricultural production. The hills undulate, the trees are lush, and the scenery is also beautiful. Unfortunately, since the tenth year of the Republic of China, it has suffered from bandits, resulting in the flight of the people, with ten houses empty in every ten. Recently, the mountains have been bare and the fields uncultivated. Since last year, the Anhui Provincial Government established county administration here, and the banditry has gradually subsided, and the people have gradually returned. It is heard that Li Weitang, Guo Yifan, and others organized a Ganlu Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company there last summer, not avoiding the hardship and difficulty, resolutely abandoning their urban life and returning to farming. They have now reclaimed about thirty square li of land and engaged in cultivation and animal husbandry.

Anyone interested in this can directly write to Mr. Zhu Qiqing of the Sanji Company in this port to obtain a brochure. The company is also very willing to assist those who are interested in returning to farming but do not know how to do so.</p>

<p>Reading Questions and Answers</p>
<h3>What We Need: "Reading Guidance" (II)</h3>
<p>｜Answering Mr. Luo Dazhang regarding the direction of our work;</p>
<p>And seeking advice from friends who care about our work.</p>
<p>We accept with boundless joy the response from society to our newly established small endeavor. Although we have been working for less than a week, we have already received dozens of letters of encouragement and constructive suggestions from friends. Such attention from society makes us feel very apprehensive; at the same time, it further illustrates the objective need for our work. It is a matter that urgently needs to be addressed but that no one in society has yet come forward to advocate.</p>
<p>Now, we have boldly begun. But it can only truly be said to be a "beginning." This is because, as Mr. Luo said, "The difficulties ahead are probably more difficult than running a university"; moreover, there is no precedent in society that we can refer to, and everything is in the process of experimentation. To what extent we will achieve in the future, no one can predict now. However, the direction of our work is one that we have long determined.</p>
<p>"Reading Guidance" is not something that a few enthusiasts rely on, based on their own momentary pleasure, starting from personal ideals. It is based on the objective requirements of our library, starting from the urgent facts before us. Therefore, Mr. Luo's suggestion that "the focus of guidance should be on the current practical life of readers" is completely consistent with our views. If life is the main body, all education can be interpreted in a broad sense as guidance for life, and reading naturally becomes a means. However, life guidance, even in terms of education, is multifaceted. We should pay attention to guiding reading, and not forget that reading is a supplement to the lives of readers, not an end in itself. However, we find it difficult to truly take on the role of life guidance. Fortunately, the lessons in practical life are greater than anything else. Since readers are all people who are struggling in real life, their life experience can naturally show them the path they should take. We can only, or should only, provide everyone with supplementary experience (i.e., reading), analysis of phenomena, and instruction of causal laws. The road is for everyone to walk on their own. Therefore, Mr. Luo wants us to "pay attention to life guidance," which we completely agree with in principle, but can only do so in fact. Therefore, from the reader's point of view, reading is a means, not an end; and from our point of view, it seems that guiding reading has become our purpose.</p>
<p>In addition to the above discussion of principles, Mr. Luo also put forward many valuable opinions regarding our work. Because our work is based on our draft "plan" to proceed, we will now outline the steps we are currently implementing, and at the same time seek advice from Mr. Luo.</p>
<p>That's right! We are happy to be "silent and colorless." Because the practice of our work determines the content of our work. The facts determine that we are not running a university or opening a college here, nor are we cultivating talents or creating PhDs for society; therefore, the diligent group that flocks to us and discusses with us are the daily lives of dignity and humility, the greatest and the smallest, the general and the special, the profound and the superficial, in short, the experiences of all the problems that arise in all the flows of life "up and down, past and present," "heaven and hell." But it is not a chaotic inculcation, but rather a connection through practice, fused into a certain connection, with systematic guidance. The scope of our discussion is naturally broader, shallower, and more trivial than what is talked about in a university lecture hall; but we have no intention of giving purely theoretical preaching to people who can enter university. Therefore, the progress of our work is to first start with an investigation of the reader's life situation, ask the reader to raise his own practical needs and requirements, make a personal reading plan, introduce him to the reading materials he needs in his own life, and solve the difficult problems in the reading materials that are not easy to understand. Although we clearly recognize everyone's requirements from practice, we will never cater to low-level tastes and lower the standards of culture. We want to liberate ourselves from the consciousness of building imperialism and raise the general cultural level.</p>
<p>We hope that everyone will recognize the direction of our work and not make excessively high hopes or hopes that cannot be fulfilled in fact.</p>
<p>Even so, we also know that our task is huge. Therefore, before starting work, we had several months of preparation and hired dozens of experts who sympathized with us as specialized consultants for this department. Therefore, any difficulties that the staff of this department cannot solve can be answered by specialized consultants. Therefore, the so-called "blocking everyone's opinions" will naturally not happen. We know that the completion of our work depends not only on our own efforts, but also on cooperation with experts, and especially on close contact with readers, to achieve considerable results.</p>
<p>In short: Our first attitude towards readers is not to make deceptive false words, and not to make frightening and empty promises. Second, we will do whatever we can, and we will not make excessive hopes. Even in terms of guiding reading, we can only roughly indicate a road that everyone believes is necessary, and it is still difficult to be completely confident whether it is substantial or thorough. However, we always do our best to seek for ourselves and for others, without shame. As for enriching our work, that is something that can only be produced from the practice of work, and cannot be created by one or two enthusiasts in a writing room.</p>
<p>This is the direction of our work.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that Mr. Luo and those who care about our work will often give us advice and criticism. We also hope that readers will earnestly establish close cooperation with us.</p>
<p>To Ms. Fang, He Zhongyong, Li Shengshan, Zhang Guocai, and Zhang Guisheng: Please provide detailed addresses so that we can reply by letter. (On behalf of the post)</p>

<p>Report on Vocational Education by the Ministry of Education's Commissioner to Europe</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>(C) Agricultural Schools: Agricultural schools are of a secondary school nature, teaching practical agricultural knowledge. Some also specialize in specific agricultural fields, such as grape cultivation, fruit orchard cultivation, horticulture, beekeeping, chicken farming, wine brewing, beer brewing, sugar making, cattle raising, and dairy production.</p>
<p>(3) Funding and Administration: With the exception of private schools, the funding for all public and government-run vocational schools is provided by the central or local governments, or by trade guilds. The operating expenses of supplementary schools are all provided by the local government, but teachers' salaries are partly provided by the state government. Middle and primary vocational schools are either run by the state government, the city government, or funded by vocational groups. However, regardless of where the funding comes from or what the governing body is, all levels of vocational schools are subject to government supervision.</p>
<p>(4) Teacher Training: The sources of teachers in vocational schools can be divided into two categories. The first category is engineers and architects, all of whom come from higher industrial schools and have many years of experience. Their tenure is for life. The second category is skilled artisans, whose tenure is either fixed for several years or for life. Schools and the development of free professions are always related. Some vocational schools, in addition to employing craftsmen, also hire people with special skills as teachers.</p>
<p>According to statistics from 1927, Germany had a total of 29,652 supplementary schools and middle and primary vocational schools, with 100,2923 male and female teachers, and 2,507,028 male and female students, of which students in supplementary education accounted for 94%, and vocational school students only accounted for 6%.</p>
<p>(2) School Visit Records</p>
<p>Hamburg</p>
<p>(1) Girls' Commercial Vocational School: The school is divided into junior and senior commercial departments, with a total of 550 students divided into 21 classes. The weekly coursework ranges from 32 to 34 hours. Specialized subjects include bookkeeping, shorthand, and typing. General subjects include German, economics, and civics. The junior class accepts primary school graduates, while the senior class accepts middle school students. The entrance exams for the junior class are in German and mathematics. There are no entrance exams for the senior class. Both the junior and senior classes graduate in two years. Graduates of the senior class can enter specialized commercial colleges for further studies.</p>
<p>(2) Girls' Vocational Supplementary School: This is a supplementary school for female workers, maids, and female employees. Students must have received eight years of basic schooling. The weekly coursework is eight hours. There are the following four training courses: (a) Needlework, housework, and home economics (b) Hygiene, social sciences, civics and moral education (c) Special courses divided into two parts: (i) Theater arts and dance (ii) Sewing (d) Unemployment class: Currently, 48% of the graduates are unemployed. The school has specially set up classes to engage in continuing supplementary studies to eliminate their leisure time, focusing on German, housework, and cooking. Students who wish to study home economics full-time must attend classes for 25 hours per week. The subjects include needlework, handicrafts, and home economics.</p>
<p>Düsseldorf</p>
<p>(1) Craft School (FachulefurHandwerk): This school is a mixed school of supplementary vocational and full-time vocational training. Supplementary classes are mostly for apprenticeship training, with eight to ten hours of coursework per week, all guided by craftsmen. Full-time classes are for craftsman training. Apprenticeship classes must graduate in three or four years to be eligible to take the craftsman exam. Craftsman classes must pass three to six semesters to be eligible to take the master craftsman exam. This is the custom of German craft vocational training. Currently, there are 800 supplementary students and 180 full-time vocational students. The school is divided into the following departments: 1. Metalwork, 2. Decorative Arts, 3. Shoemaking, 4. Needlework, 5. Architecture, 6. Ceramics. The situation of each department of the school can be described as follows:</p>

<h3>Resolutions of the People's Education Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 11th) The Ministry of Education's People's Education Committee held a meeting at the Ministry of Education at 9:00 AM on the 11th. More than ten people, including Wang Shijie, Duan Xipeng, Zhang Jiong, Niu Yongjian, Chen Lifu, Yu Dantang, and Wang Qi, attended. Wang Shijie chaired the meeting, reporting on the significance of convening the meeting, the process of compiling the nine drafts of the ministry, and proposed the implementation methods, and the two types of people's education scope. After a long discussion with various committee members, he then withdrew and Duan Xipeng chaired the meeting. First, there was a discussion of the general principles for people's education, implementation methods, and the essentials of implementation, clarifying many points. Three cases were decided after summarizing various opinions: (1) It was stipulated that the implementation outline should be drafted by the three committee members, Chen Lifu, Chen Jian, and Meng Xiancheng. (2) The Ministry's first and ninth cases, and Xiang Jutan's proposal to request the ministry to consult internally and designate one or several provinces for the county-level public hall director or farmer education hall director to concurrently serve as the district chief, or the integration of administrative and educational affairs, were combined for review. Niu Yongjian, Chen Lifu, Xiang Jutan, Gao Yang, and Wang Qi were selected for review, convened by Niu. (3) The original fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cases were combined for review, and Zhong Daozan, Yu Jingtang, etc. were selected for review. The results of the review and the draft outline will be presented at the general meeting on the morning of the 12th.</p>
<p>List of Committee Members</p>
<p>In addition to Jia Xipeng, Qian Changzhao, Zhang Jiong, Peng Baichuan, Chen Panzhao, Zhong Daozan, and Zhong Tingxi, the general meeting committee separately hired Niu Yongjian, Meng Xiancheng, Chen Lifu, Yu Jingtang, Wang Qi, Xu Tinghu, Chen Jian, Gao Jian, Liang Shuming, Xiang Jutan, Wang Xianqiang, Yan Yangchu and other twelve people as committee members.</p>
<p>General Meeting Proposals</p>
<p>All proposals have also been drafted by the Ministry of Education, including (1) Draft of the Public School Promotion Project, (2) Draft of the Public School Regulations, (3) Draft of the Provisional Regulations for the Public Education Hall, (4) Draft of the Curriculum Standards for Public Schools of the Ministry of Education, (5) Draft of the Compilation and Review of Public Reading Materials, (6) Measures for Promoting Vocational Supplementary Studies, (7) Draft for Improving and Enriching National Libraries, (8) Draft Regulations for Public Education Districts in Provinces, Cities, and Counties, (9) Draft Regulations for the Appointment and Treatment of Social Education Personnel, and other nine items.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiong's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Zhang Jiong, the Director of the Department of Social Education, among the Chinese people, from the age of sixteen to the age of sixty, there are more than 220 million people who have not received education. It goes without saying that this hinders political training, and it is an extremely dangerous phenomenon in the face of the serious national crisis today. In view of this, the Ministry of Education intends to vigorously promote public education. It is planned to add two districts in each province every year. All those who are sixteen years old or older and under fifty years old who cannot write their names (excluding the disabled) must be forced to receive public education until it reaches the entire province. All expenses will be properly disbursed from the donations from group institutions, schools, and factories and shops in each district, and local public properties will be used as school buildings. All educational personnel, whether they have graduated from higher primary school or are current primary school teachers, regardless of whether they are workers or shop assistants, can be appointed to promote popularization.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Corrects First Edition of Combined School Regulations</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education instructed the education departments of various provinces and cities, stating that in the first edition of the Combined Law and Regulations for Primary and Secondary Schools, Normal Schools, and Vocational Schools, on page 55, line 9, Article 63 of the Secondary School Regulations: "…should remain in the original grade for the next academic year," and in the errata listed on page 90, line 8, Article 67 of the Normal School Regulations: "…should remain in the original grade," is corrected to "…should remain in the original grade." The three words "original grade" are all a mistake for "original year." In the future, the legal regulations should be based on the articles published in the Ministry's Gazette, Volume 5, Issues 11, 12, 25, and 26, and the Collection of Education Laws and Regulations. Item 7 of the errata attached to the Collection of Education Laws and Regulations should be completely deleted. In addition to separate orders, this order is to inform and note.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Six Counties in Jia District of Zhejiang Province Retain the Principal of the Attached Elementary School</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Shen Leiyu took over the Jiazhong Attached Elementary School in Zhejiang Province, the school affairs have been flourishing, and the guidance work has been particularly diligent. However, recently, due to the difficulty in handling affairs, Mr. Shen has been physically and mentally exhausted and has suddenly developed the idea of resigning. After repeated persuasion from the Education Department, Principal Zhang of Jiazhong, and the teachers of the attached elementary school, they were unable to change his mind. It is reported that the heads of the education bureaus of the six counties, including Chongde, have also unanimously agreed to retain him and have requested the Education Department not to approve his resignation. On the one hand, they sent representatives from the three counties of Pinghu, Jiashan, and Chongde to Nanjing to ask Principal Zhang to consider the future education of the six counties and earnestly retain Principal Shen. It is reported that Principal Zhang has agreed to respect the opinions of the representatives of the six counties, and Mr. Shen has also agreed to consider it.</p>
<h3>Education Ministry Supervisor Zhou Bangdao Discusses the Recent Situation of Education in Henan Province After Inspection</h3>
<p>Zhou Bangdao, a supervisor of the Ministry of Education, returned from inspecting education in Shaanxi and Henan provinces. He had previously described the education situation in Shaanxi, and his talk was published in detail in the newspapers. Now, we are pleased to share his detailed discussion of the recent situation of education in Henan below.</p>
<p>The regular education expenditure in Henan Province for this year is 2,375,192 yuan, with temporary expenses of about 220,000 yuan, totaling about 2.6 million yuan. The largest source is the tax on pawnshop contracts, followed by the income from school property. The Education Department has an Education Property Management Office, and each county has a Contract Tax Management Bureau. The provincial and county education funds have been independent for many years, and the amount is considerable. However, the proportion of vocational education funds, compared with the standards set by the Ministry, is still far behind.</p>
<p>There are many educational institutions of various types in Henan Province, especially the number of county-level normal schools, which is rare except for Hebei Province. (1) Higher education includes one provincial university, one provincial vocational college, and one private college. (2) Secondary education: A. "Middle Schools": Junior middle schools: 16 provincial, 23 county, 1 joint, 37 private. Senior middle schools: 2 provincial, 2 attached, and provincial 3, private 4 combined junior and senior. B. "Normal": 8 provincial, 73 county. C. "Vocational": Junior vocational: 3 provincial, 21 county, 1 private. Senior vocational: 1 attached, and provincial 3 combined junior and senior. (3) Primary Education: A. Junior primary schools: 2,210 county, 11,093 township/district, 2,163 private. B. Senior primary schools: 73 county, 39 township/district, 10 private. C. Complete primary schools: 11 provincial, 9 attached, 472 county, 274 township/district, 43 private. D. Kindergartens: 22 public. (4) Social Education includes 89 provincial public education centers, 135 libraries, 1 museum, 1 art gallery, 1,468 public schools, 1,531 reading rooms, 84 gymnasiums, 8 lecture halls, and 16 privately established amusement parks.</p>
<p>The provincial and county education administrative organs are well-organized, and the implementation of education laws and regulations is quite rapid. County education bureaus are divided into five levels, each with one director. Levels one and two have two supervisors, three section chiefs, and three staff members. Levels three and four have one supervisor, two section chiefs, and two staff members each. Level five has one supervisor and one section chief each, and two staff members.</p>
<p>The Education Department has established the Kaifeng Education Experimental Zone Committee, presided over by Mr. Li Buqing. The children and the public in Kaifeng are the experimental subjects. It is a leading institution for experimenting with primary and social education, divided into seven departments: 1. Testing Department, 2. Applied Textbook Editing Department, 3. Experimental Education Monthly Editing Department, 4. Big Flower Garden Education Village, 5. Xinghua Garden Education Town, 6. Children's Science Museum, 7. Health Committee. Each department is working intensively and innovatively. The Henan Children's Science Museum recently opened, and children from various primary schools in Kaifeng have the opportunity to use the museum's instruments, medicines, specimens, and charts. This kind of centralized equipment approach is extremely economical and meets the needs. However, since the museum is established by the Experimental Zone Committee and its scope is limited to Kaifeng, it would be more appropriate to reorganize it into the Kaifeng Children's Science Museum. The Provincial Kaifeng Tenth Primary School is piloting a double-shift system under the guidance of the committee. The results of the trial implementation over the past year are good. It is said that it can save several teachers and classrooms. If this system is gradually evolved and improved and its trial scope is expanded, it will be able to compensate for the shortcomings of the general two-part system in the future.</p>
<p>Many of the provincial primary schools that are piloting the two-part system are increasing the number of classes and assigning each teacher a certain number of duty hours, which is no different from regular classes. It is said that this is to maintain the parents' usual belief in the school and there are unavoidable difficulties. However, this approach seems to have lost the original meaning of the two-part system, and there is an urgent need for research and improvement.</p>
<p>The number of places visited this time was not many. Judging from the schools inspected, the Provincial Kaifeng First Primary School, Tenth Primary School, and the Attached Primary School of the Provincial Jixian Normal School are well-managed. The county-level primary schools in Jixian, Gongxian, Yanshi, and other counties are also commendable. The school sites of Gongxian First Primary School and Girls' Primary School are too low-lying and damp, and many teachers and students suffer from malaria and foot diseases as a result, which urgently needs to be relocated. The school building of Dengfeng First Primary School is old and the lighting is dim, which is not suitable.</p>
<p>The Provincial Luoyang Girls' Middle School was established not long ago, and the school building layout is still neat and elegant. The Provincial Jixian Junior Middle School and Girls' Junior Middle School are quite serious in teaching and management. The Yanshi County Junior Middle School has a girls' normal class and a vocational training class. The normal school achievements are commendable. However, the school building is divided into four courtyards, which are too far apart, and it is difficult in terms of life and management. The students of Kaifeng Private Beicang Girls' Middle School all live on campus, and vacation requests are restricted. All activities are completely presided over by the student self-government association, and teachers and staff are in a guiding and supervisory position. The excellence of self-government ability is not often seen. The students of Private Liming Junior Middle School also all live on campus. During class time, regardless of whether there is a class or not, they must all go to the classroom to take attendance and supervise self-study, which is still strict. The salaries are determined separately according to the nature of the subject and the term of service, which is also quite fair. Each class of the Private Lianghe Junior Middle School has a counselor, and the usual tests are held outside of class time, which is quite economical. The teachers and staff of Jixian Private Yubei Junior Middle School work hard, and more than 90% of the graduates of the previous year have been admitted to provincial senior secondary schools. The equipment and instruments of Zhengxian Private Mingxin Junior Middle School have been increasing every year. Recently, a training week system has been piloted, and the virtues are determined according to the needs of the facts. Each grade has either the same virtue with different standards, or the virtues and standards are completely different. The progress is continuous, the results are examined within a time limit, and the facts are sought from the truth. The rituals are always appropriate. The spirit of the above-mentioned private middle schools is quite special, and all the methods are worthy of observation.</p>
<p>The county-level normal schools in various counties are mostly three-year systems, which is inconsistent with the current regulations and urgently need to extend the term and change to a simplified normal school. The Provincial Jixian Normal School has clean and tidy school buildings, strict management and training, and the service performance of graduates is quite good. The Provincial Huixian Baiquan Rural Normal School is the old site of Baiquan Academy, where great Confucian scholars such as Yao Xuezai, Zhao Renfu, and Sun Xiafeng gave lectures. The springs are connected to hundreds of paths and spout day and night. The pavilions and terraces have elegant scenery. Experimental areas, rural hospitals, rural factories, cooperatives, and farms are operated. Sundays, summer vacations, and all holidays are abolished, and security is implemented. Teachers and students participate in activities together. They get up at 5:30 every morning to do morning exercises. After the exercises, a farmers' association is held. The spirit is vigorous and the academic atmosphere is excellent. It is the most distinctive and energetic school seen this time. However, there are too many educational subjects set up, and students at all levels are divided into rural schools and rural social groups. From the perspective of the entire rural normal education, it is unavoidable that it is close to fragmentation.</p>
<p>The products of the Provincial Kaifeng Dyeing and Weaving Vocational School and the Provincial Jixian Junior Dyeing and Weaving Vocational School are commendable. The types of fabrics woven by the Kaifeng Vocational School are especially numerous. However, it is a mistake to stockpile goods without trying to sell them. Most of the graduates go on to further education, or serve as primary school teachers, or are unemployed at home. There are very few people engaged in dyeing and weaving. Most of the fifteen graduates of the Kaifeng Vocational School last year served as technicians in factories in various counties, which is barely satisfactory. The Provincial Zhengxian Vocational School for Workers and Peasants was opened in August last year. A chemical engineering and arts and crafts department has been temporarily set up, divided into technician and craftsman classes. A factory is currently being planned. The transportation there is convenient, and the principal is very enthusiastic. There should be easy progress in the future. It is said that Henan Province has a construction and education cooperation plan. If it can be realized, the future of vocational education will be more beneficial.</p>
<p>Labor teaching in various schools is mostly the same as the previous handicraft class. However, the farm practice of the Provincial Baiquan Rural Normal School, sweeping, standing guard, watering flowers, irrigating bamboo, and repairing roads, the road paving and flower planting of the Huixian County Normal School, the flattening of the playground of the Provincial Jixian Normal School, the construction of the road of the Provincial Zhengxian Vocational School for Workers and Peasants, and the weaving of wicker and making batteries of Private Mingxin Middle School have a relatively expanded scope and the operation is quite practical. The types, styles, and uses of handicraft works in Kaifeng schools, under the advocacy of Zhang Junjushan, are full of educational meaning, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education's Response to Zhou Xiaozhen's Request to Promulgate the Tangram Phonetic Symbols Case</h3>
<p>Zhou Xiaozhen has repeatedly published advertisements in the Shanghai Shenbao to promote the Tangram Phonetic Symbols. He expressed dissatisfaction with the Ministry of Education's reply. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Education, Zhou Xiaozhen's case occurred in the 20th year of the Republic of China. First, Zhou Xiaozhen presented phonetic symbols formed by tangrams, called Phonetic Symbol Games, to the Ministry for review. The Ministry approved the issuance immediately because it was used for games. Later, Zhou Xiaozhen requested a subsidy for printing and requested the Ministry to announce and distribute it. The Ministry believed that it was difficult to approve the subsidy, and the request for publication was related to the national language and should be sent to the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee for review. After review by the committee, it was deemed that it could not be published. The rejection reasons were six, about two thousand words, all based on academic theory. The conclusion was roughly that "the committee believes that the phonetic symbol game written by Zhou Xiaozhen uses the secular toy tangrams to form the outline of forty phonetic symbols, which can be used to help practice phonetic symbols as one of the methods in children's education toys. However, the proposed correction of the phonetic symbol printing type and description actually wants to use the shapes formed by this tangram toy as the basic style of the phonetic symbols. The standard of regular script, cursive script, and the printing industry casting copper molds are all used to replace the style of calligraphy for phonetic alphabets promulgated by the Ministry. The committee has carefully reviewed that the shapes are only slightly similar to the phonetic symbols, some are inclined, some are skewed, and some have unclear strokes. There is no way to start writing according to the style. If the type is cast, it will not form a line. In addition to being used as children's toys and games, it is of no other use. The request for publication and promulgation should not be considered." Later, Zhou Xiaozhen submitted a document requesting a review. The Ministry believed that the matter concerned academic research, and it was not too detailed to ask for details. It sent the original case to the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee for re-examination. During the re-examination, it suddenly received two telegrams from his son Zhou Canlian. One said that his father was worried about the seven-piece phonetic symbols and cried bloodlessly and insomniously, and the other said that his father cried for the phonetic symbols. However, the Ministry still approved the request of the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee and took the point of using tangrams to help practice phonetic symbols, only allowing the free publication of phonetic symbol games and the free casting of type and printing for trial use. The words "Approved for publication by the Ministry of Education after review" can be printed on the book when the book is published. The request for promulgation by the Ministry is still not necessary. Zhou Xiaozhen insisted on his own opinion and insisted on being promulgated by the Ministry. He kept begging and kept presenting. After that, no replies were given to the submissions. The promulgation of decrees must be prudent and detailed, and there is absolutely no reason to lightly publish them due to private requests. If Zhou Xiaozhen does not realize this and arbitrarily publishes announcements in various newspapers, using illegal and insulting words to confuse the public, the Ministry will not continue to forgive him.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Stipulates Receipts for School Construction Fees for Various Schools</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued instructions to municipal schools yesterday, stating that it has recently been found that some municipal schools at all levels collect tuition and construction fees from students without issuing formal receipts in accordance with the accounting regulations, or even temporarily issuing temporary receipts under the pretext that the formal receipts take time to be stamped, which is not a proper practice. It is hereby decided that from the second semester of the 22nd academic year, all tuition and construction fees collected by each school must be filled in with the official four-part receipt jointly printed by the Bureau and the Finance Bureau, and no temporary receipts of the respective schools shall be used again in order to examine and re-count the political affairs.

<h3>Middle School Students' Bookstore Publishes Contemporary Chinese for Middle Schools</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Department of Education, recognizing the significant disparities in Chinese curriculum among middle schools across the province, strictly compiled a Chinese syllabus and selected readings in accordance with the new curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education. However, the originally selected articles were scattered throughout ancient and modern texts, making them difficult to locate. Now, the Shanghai Middle School Students' Bookstore has hired experienced middle school teachers, such as Sheng Langxi, Xu Zhen'e, and Zhu _, currently teaching Chinese at the Provincial Shanghai Middle School, Provincial Songjiang Middle School, and Provincial Songjiang Girls' Middle School, to diligently search, annotate, and analyze grammar to complete the book. It has also been carefully reviewed and corrected by Liu Yazi, Xiang Jutan, section chief of the Jiangsu Department of Education, and Jin Zonghua, supervisor, ensuring accuracy. Consequently, contemporary celebrities and school principals have unanimously praised it. It is reported that this book is titled "Contemporary Chinese," and the volumes for the spring semester (i.e., volumes for Senior High 2, 4, and 6, and Junior High 2, 4, and 6) have already been published successively, while the volumes for the autumn semester are also in print. Middle schools, secondary vocational schools, and normal schools across the country will surely be eager to adopt it first. Schools and businesses that directly order from the bookstore will receive special discounts. Sample copies and other materials will be sent upon request.</p>

<h3>Last Night, the West YMCA Basketball Team Faced the Jinan Team, but Lost 31-45</h3>
<p>The West YMCA basketball game last night featured only one Group A match. Jinan displayed excellent performance, but despite the strength of the Pirates, they ultimately failed. In the second half, Jinan briefly led 23-20. Although they eventually lost 31-45 after exhausting their efforts, they gave the Pirates a run for their money. In addition, in the two Group B matches, Moore defeated the French team 45-17, and Tongwen defeated the Junior team in a one-sided contest, leading 19-5 in the first half and ultimately winning 50-17.</p>
<p>The Pirates Defeat Jinan</p>
<p>Jinan's performance has been quite good in recent matches. Yesterday's game against the Pirates was tense, with the score difference often remaining within a few points. It was only in the last five minutes that Jinan faltered and lost. At the start of the game, the Pirates were radiant, with Carlson and Ryan scoring repeatedly, quickly taking a 10-1 lead. Jinan quickly caught up, with Han Zhenyuan making every shot, closing the gap to 17-20 in the first half. In the second half, Jinan was unstoppable. Gu Shangdong scored two consecutive baskets, and Huang Zhaolin added to the lead, briefly pushing Jinan ahead 23-20. The Pirates intensified their efforts, and after Ryan scored three points, Smith created a 25-23 advantage. From then on, Jinan could only see their backs. Although Huang Zhaolin's long shots helped them close the gap to 27-29 and 31-33, closely following behind, Jinan's momentum plummeted in the last few minutes, losing six points in a row, and ultimately losing 31-45.</p>

<p>Moore Defeats the French Team</p>
<p>In the second Group B match, Moore and the French team continued to compete. The French team had plenty of courage but lacked skill. After the start of the game, Moore's young players were seen weaving in and out, unstoppable, with the score rising rapidly, reaching 19-8 in the first half. In the second half, Moore's momentum became even greater. Backguard Song Qifu successfully broke through several times, returning with credit. The result was 45-16, with the French team suffering a major defeat.</p>

<h3>Two-Roads Football Team Decides to Join West League Football Association This Autumn</h3>

<h3>Ms. Wang Yan Invents a Lawn Tennis Game Method</h3>
<p>Similar to Volleyball, Highly Suitable for Elderly Women</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Yan, a talented student at the Beiman Girls' Middle School in Beiping and a native of Zhenjiang, enjoys sports in her spare time. Based on her years of experience, she has recently invented lawn tennis game rules. It is reported that Ms. Wang has not only sent the rules to the National Sports Association for review and promotion, but also provided a copy to us, which we are publishing here for those who enjoy sports to study.</p>
<p>㈠ Name</p>
<p>The game can be set up and played in family courtyards, hence the name Lawn Tennis.</p>
<p>㈡ Venue</p>
<p>Divide an ordinary family courtyard into two parts with a horizontal line, each part being 8 meters wide and 4 meters long, as shown in the diagram on the left. At each end of the horizontal line in the diagram, erect a pole and tie a net. The net is 2 meters high, and a basket (with a bottom) is suspended every 2 meters (a total of 3 baskets). The baskets are circular, with a diameter of one foot, made of metal rings, similar to basketball hoops, parallel to the net rope. Half of the basket is in Party A's area and half in Party B's area, as shown in Figures 2 and 3.</p>
<p>㈢ Number of Players</p>
<p>When playing, divide into two teams, Party A and Party B, with seven players on each team, divided into two rows, four in the front row and three in the back row, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>㈣ Competition</p>
<p>Serving: ㈠ At the beginning of the match, the right to serve first in the first set is determined by drawing lots. The right to serve first in subsequent sets belongs to the losing team of the previous set. ㈡ After the start of the match, the right to serve belongs to the party that scored the point at that time. ㈢ The players of each party serving should take turns according to the numbers in Figure 1, otherwise, the entire set will be considered a loss. ㈣ The score is not related to the right to serve (e.g., if Party A's right to serve is taken by Party B due to one failure, Party B should score the points they deserve for each win). ㈤ The server should stand outside the sideline and must not cross the extended line of the end line, otherwise, the ball served will be invalid (see 笔 for invalid balls). ㈥ The server throws the ball into the air and uses one or both hands to legally lift the ball over the top of the net, Figure 2</p>
<p>without touching any part of the net or basket, landing in the area within the opponent's sideline and end line, or being accepted by any player on the opponent's team, or touching any part of any player's body, then the ball is valid, called a valid ball. Conversely, if the ball lands outside the opponent's sideline or end line,</p>
<p>Figure 3</p>
<p>(Pole height: 2 meters for women, 2.5 meters for men)</p>
<p>and is not touched or accepted by the opponent's players, or does not pass through the top of the net, it is considered invalid, called an invalid ball. If it touches the top of the net or basket, and the ball falls into the opponent's valid area, it is considered a net ball. There are two serving opportunities for each serve. One of the two must be a valid ball. When the ball is considered valid, both sides defend and attack. If both serves are invalid balls, it is considered one failure, and the opponent gets one point and takes the right to serve. If the first serve is a net ball, there are still two serving opportunities. If the second serve is still a net ball, it should be considered an invalid ball. ㈦ If the server serves the ball into the basket without violating any rules, the ball entering the basket is considered an "in-basket ball," and is considered to be worth two points, the same as an in-basket in an ordinary game. ㈧ If any player on Party A violates a rule when a certain player on Party A is serving, then whether the ball served at that time is valid or invalid, it should be considered an invalid ball. If any player on Party B violates a rule, whether the ball served at that time is invalid or valid, it should be considered a valid ball, and Party A wins one point. If Party B violates the rule intentionally to prevent the ball from entering the basket, Party A wins two points, the judgment of which is determined by the referee.</p>
<p>Scoring</p>
<p>㈠ Falling ball: When a party uses a legal lifting method, without violating the rules, and the ball falls within the opponent's sideline and end line (touching the line counts as inside) from the top of the net, or touching the top of the net and basket, it is called a falling ball, and that party wins one point. ㈡ In-basket ball: When a party uses a legal lifting method, without violating the rules, and lifts the ball into the basket without it falling out, it is considered that the ball has entered the basket, called an in-basket ball, and that party wins two points. ㈢ If a party does not use a legal lifting method to lift the ball over, whether the ball enters the basket or lands, the opponent wins one point. ㈣ One violation by a party, or several violations at the same time, regardless of whether the ball is lifted over the opponent or not, wins one point. ㈤ If both Party A and Party B violate the rules, the party that violates the rule first is considered to have violated the rule, and the party that violates the rule later is not considered to have violated the rule. ㈥ Under any circumstances, if a party's player intentionally violates a rule once, or several violations at the same time, to defend against the opponent's attack, it is called an intentional violation, and the opponent wins two points (for example, when a certain party is lifting the ball into the basket, the opponent's player determines this). ㈦ When serving, if the ball becomes a falling ball or an in-basket ball, the points are still awarded according to ㈠ or ㈡. ㈧ Neutral ball: When both parties' players touch the ball in the air at the same time, it is called a neutral ball, and no points are awarded. Another serve is made (To be continued).</p>

<h3>1934 Style</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Time and space, linked to the tail, "unceasing" and "seamless", so everything can progress, and change with each passing day. Needless to say, in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, naturally, it is also different from the 22nd year of the Republic of China, playing with all the new things that the 22nd year of the Republic of China would not play, dare not play, could not play, or could not think of playing.</p>
<p>Today is the first day of the first month of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. How short is human life? Enjoy the moment! So at the beginning of this year, we should find a happy way, which is the great truth of life. Whoever sighs long and sighs short, worrying about the times and hurting the country, fearing the destruction of the country and the extinction of the race, is an outstanding, top-notch, double-strength idiot who should be asked by the youngsters to attack him with drums.</p>
<p>Today, we should "only talk about love and romance, not politics."</p>
<p>Speaking of love and romance, naturally, we can't forget, and it's indispensable, to mention women. The 23rd year of the Republic of China is 1934. I wonder what kind of fashion the women of 1934 will be following. Last year, the most fashionable women were healthy and beautiful, so many women ran to the beach to get a dark tan, which was said to make them unspeakably beautiful. "Weak and frail" is already outdated. The healthy and beautiful style of 1933 may not be so popular in 1934. According to my ideal, perhaps the trend this year should be "nudity."</p>
<p>Besides "women," in terms of love and romance, we should talk about the problem of "drinking." Vulgar people drink wine, and elegant people also drink wine, but Chinese wine is no longer in the modern group. Foreign wine, because the United States has lifted the ban on alcohol, is no longer rare and therefore not valuable. Undoubtedly, in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, it may no longer be valued. Tea has declined now. You see, the export volume has plummeted. Foreigners no longer welcome it, so how can it be considered a standard drink of 1934? I calculate with my fingers that this year, coffee is destined to be popular. Watch it! In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the owners of tiger stove shops may scratch out the "tea" character on their signs and replace it with "coffee." Indeed, coffee is tasty enough, because it is more novel than anything else, from the perspective of Chinese history.</p>
<p>Architecture, cars, leather shoes, coats, even walking, perming hair, crying and laughing, sneezing, inevitably, from the 22nd year to the 23rd year, all have to come up with a new style. Everyone should keep their eyes wide open and watch.</p>
<h3>Jiangbei Children</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Jiangbei people, there is almost no place without their traces. Some people say, "Among the human races in the world, the Japanese have the strongest vitality. If we discuss according to the provinces of China, then the Jiangbei people can be considered the most resistant to hardship and able to strive for survival in the current environment. Needless to say, along the railway, there are Jiangbei women and children, old and young, picking coal pieces to live their lives. Even in the inland counties and towns, they all live and breathe there. Alas! Although Jiangbei people are humble, Jiangbei people are indeed 'God helps those who help themselves.' People look down on them, but I want to praise them, they are good people with the most struggling and fighting spirit in the national character!"</p>
<p>Let's not talk about other places, just from our Jiading County, although it is attached to the Guo, Jiangbei people seem to live together as a tribe. When they first came, it was just a small boat. Later, when the boat was broken, they left it on the river beach on the side of the bank and used the boat as a house. This is the first step. What is their life like? Selling water chestnuts, selling ginger, selling fruits, constantly doing small businesses! What I especially admire is that their reproductive power is also different from other places. For example, a man and a woman from Jiangbei, besides the two of them, there are always three or four children. If it is summer or autumn, they are always naked, living freely like in the age of primitive people. Even when the weather is cold, they will wear discarded broken shoes, broken hats, and broken jackets to fight against the west wind. Their noses are frozen red, but their hands are still white. When the weather is hot, they pick up radish and soybean skins along the way to use as fuel, so Jiangbei people in this kind of place, even the children, are doing a public service. Because the roads can be cleaned, so that many flies will not breed, which is more common than the sanitation police cleaners. Now in winter, in the morning, groups of three to five Jiangbei children pick up vegetable cutting boards and vegetable leaves, which can make the market clean. It is truly a kind of labor that is beyond reach. May I ask if children of seven or eight years old are accustomed to being raised and afraid of the wind and water, can they do such things? Therefore, I think that when it comes to knowledge, the Jiangbei people are of course insufficient. If we want to save the country and survive in China's current situation of national poverty and financial exhaustion, and strive for the final position of self-reliance, Jiangbei children are worthy of being a model, because they can "endure hardship" and can be "industrious," which is truly admirable!</p>
<p>No one has investigated how many Jiangbei people come to do business in our county. It is probably not a small number. When they first came, they were very poor. Now there are also some who are well-off, and they are willing to be natives and have become related to the local people, so their children have lost the Jiangbei people's kind and have assimilated with the locals. There are still those who live in three or two thatched houses, with a little savings, and their children are said to eat sweet potato skins every day, but their faces are also fat. People get frostbite in the winter, but their faces are smooth and slippery. Think about it! Isn't this clear evidence that "God helps those who help themselves"?</p>
<h3>From Hunchback to Mute</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhi</p>
<p>At first, when a modern young man pursues a modern lady, he is cautious, bending over, and speaking softly, like a "hunchback."</p>
<p>After that, the modern young man and the modern lady fall in love, cohabitate, go out together, and return together, inseparable, and are like "cripples" who can't put down their canes.</p>
<p>Then, the modern young man and the modern lady go to the department store, and the lady sees all kinds of luxurious ornaments, reluctant to leave, and wants the young man to buy this and buy that. The young man hears nothing and pretends to be "deaf."</p>
<p>Then, the modern lady gets a little tired of the modern young man, goes out alone, and fools around with her boyfriend, dancing, watching movies, playing golf: : : Although the modern young man sees everything in his eyes, he has to pretend not to see it and act like a "blind man."</p>
<p>Finally, the modern lady files for divorce, asking the modern young man for alimony. The modern young man has lost his lover, and also has to go to court. He takes out the money and is so angry that he can't even open his mouth, like a "mute."</p>
<h3>Tianyun Tower</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>The green elevator was about to burst from the crowding. At this moment, there was no distinguishing men from women, our bodies pressed tightly together. High shoulders, wide velvet hats, small faces under black leather collars, hazy eyes, blood-red lips – the scent of powder and spearmint.</p>
<p>Squeezing, squeezing. The elevator stopped with a 'click'. People, like birds released from a net, flew off in all directions.</p>
<p>Here, there was a different world.</p>
<p>There were laborers wearing hunting caps, young gentlemen in long gowns and short jackets (?), country girls, there were:</p>
<p>Waitresses, such pretty girls, like young mistresses in a mansion, but not as comfortable as those young mistresses. Carrying copper kettles and twisting handkerchiefs, they had to squeeze into the crowd and smile at everyone – even perhaps the most hated, boorish man – letting people laugh at them. They were selling smiles, and they were also selling their chastity.</p>
<p>In the dark and gloomy cinema, men almost all harbored the hearts of beasts. Temptation emanated from those: : those: : women. Their cheeks were sallow, their faces thin, standing in every corner, watched over by those old women. Life told them: 'Exchange your bodies and souls for food!'</p>
<p>Thus, faint frowns and shallow smiles, thus, the burning of lust. Look, the contradictions of society are here.</p>
<p>Here, white electric lights shone everywhere, gongs and huqin played out life's cry, 'Hey, friend; is this a place for entertainment?' Zhongpo pulled my arm, looking down. Streetcars, cars, came and went in endless streams, and the pitifully small rickshaws were squeezed in between, the people walking like crawling ants. We had reached the highest peak of the city.</p>
<p>We laughed madly, at the flag, torn by the wind, that read 'Tianyun Tower'.</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 21</p>
<p>Whispered Words by Lamplight, Heartfelt Instruction for the Weak Offspring</p>
<p>Staff in Hand, Rambling Below the Mountain, Cold Eyes Watch the Hero</p>
<p>Old Zhao took out a handkerchief from his sleeve and wiped his forehead twice, his face flushed, and said to Ji Zhi, "Brother, what do you think? Did I handle myself without losing face?" Ji Zhi smiled and nodded, saying, "Excellent! This is what they call 'a dragon gives birth to a dragon, a tiger gives birth to a leopard cub'. With your spirit, it's no wonder Company Commander Zhao is such a good man. Let's find a place to have a bowl of water, then slowly go up the mountain. What do you think? On the way back, we can just ride donkeys; it won't take much time to get home." Old Zhao nodded and said, "Good, there's a small teahouse over there." Ji Zhi laughed, "When you come here, you can't be stingy with money. The teahouse faces the path up the mountain, and the elegant seats are in the back. If there are windows, you can only see the road we came on. We might as well go to the West Mountain Restaurant downstairs and find a casual seat, facing the mountain as we sit. Behind the West Mountain Restaurant, the scattered red leaves also have some charm. I'm treating today, so please don't be polite." Old Zhao didn't want to go to such a high-class restaurant for tea, but he had just met Ji Zhi and didn't want to offend his kindness, and he also feared people would suspect he was dodging a bill. So he smiled and said, "You friends in Western suits like things to be hygienic; you wouldn't want to go into a rural teahouse." Ji Zhi laughed, "A pot of tea is just one dollar. If I can't even afford that, it would be too difficult." As he spoke, he led the way, guiding Old Zhao to the West Mountain Restaurant at the foot of the mountain. At this time, even though the country was facing a national crisis, people living in the old capital city felt little impact, except that the word "Japan" appeared more often in the newspapers. Otherwise, those who went to the theater still went to the theater, those who ate in restaurants still ate in restaurants, and those who danced still danced. Naturally, those who traveled dozens of miles every year to see the autumn leaves still came to see the autumn leaves. (289)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes</p>
<h3>The Bullfighting at Jinhua Temple (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>Because we know that bulls are very temperamental animals, and the ones fighting are water buffalo, and don't water buffalo often have two very sharp, long horns? Wouldn't it be frightening if they fought like that? But when we got to the arena, we realized that it was completely different from what we imagined: First, these water buffalo were different from ordinary ones. Their horns were less than half a foot long and curled, covering their foreheads like human hair, making it impossible for them to gore anyone. Furthermore, during the fight, each bull had a very tough piece of leather tied to its forehead, preventing them from injuring their skin. So since bullfighting began, no one has ever seen any bloodshed. (Except for brawls between the bull owners, of course.)</p>
<p>When the bullfight began, the two bull owners each directed four or five people to lead the bulls out from the corners of the arena. At the same time, the audience around the square cheered loudly, like fans supporting a famous actor. In the midst of the cheers, both sides loosened the ropes tied to the bulls' mouths, letting them collide head-to-head. As soon as the heads separated, the referees in the arena would rush forward to correct them, making sure they followed the rules of bullfighting. They just used their heads to butt each other, seeing which one could push the other back until it was too weak to counterattack, and that was considered the winner.</p>
<p>That's pretty much how bullfighting goes. But the author found an old gentleman from Jinhua at the scene and asked him a few questions. His answers were very satisfactory to me, and I will add them below. After reading them, the reader will be able to learn something.</p>
<p>"Is the custom of bullfighting limited to Jinhua?" my question.</p>
<p>"No! The custom exists throughout eastern Zhejiang, such as Jiangshan, Zhuji, Qu County, Yongkang, Sheng County, Taishun, and other places. It is often more lively than in Jinhua. Especially in Sheng County, bullfighting is often followed by man-fighting, but I heard that it has recently been banned," replied the old gentleman from Jinhua.</p>
<p>"These bulls look like water buffalo, why don't they have long horns?" I asked again.</p>
<p>"This is a special kind of water buffalo, raised specifically for fighting."</p>
<p>"Can they plow fields?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely not!"</p>
<p>"Then what good is it for the bull owners to raise them?" I asked further.</p>
<p>"If they can win the fight, they can win money, because they often bet before letting them fight. Some bet ten or twenty yuan, and it is not uncommon for others to bet more than a hundred yuan, so conflicts often arise!"</p>
<p>"I heard that in the days before each fight, the bull owners often feed them tonics such as ginseng. Is that really the case?"</p>
<p>"That is an exaggeration by people from other counties!" The old gentleman from Jinhua shook his chicken-claw-like hands vigorously, denying that such shocking things were true. "They just let them eat some specially selected, fine fodder. There is no way they would spend that much money. At most, they would just give the bull some yellow wine to drink before the fight to stir up its temper."</p>
<p>"I see! Because so many people say that, everyone believes it is true!" I said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Then do the villagers say that Shanghai girls don't wear pants? Is that also true?" The old gentleman from Jinhua's eloquence was not bad at all.</p>
<p>"Okay, thank you for your guidance!" I quickly expressed my belief in his words. Then I changed another question. "So, does bullfighting only take place in autumn or winter?"</p>
<p>"No! It happens at any time. Because bullfighting is originally a form of entertainment for the gods, so whenever a god is re-gilded, or a ceremony of opening light takes place, or a birthday is celebrated, there is bullfighting."</p>

<h3>Fujian Situation Takes a Turn for the Worse, Many New High Prices Found in the Bond Market</h3>
<p>Troop Reduction Continues to Rise by 1.67 Yuan</p>
<p>The Rest Also Rose by Several Jiao to 1.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the war news remained good, and the situation in Fujian tended to take a sharp turn for the worse. Fuzhou could be taken in a matter of days. Although the new tariff public bond of 100 million yuan in the 23rd year has been decided to be issued, it is not circulating in the market, which of course does not hinder the market. In the evening news, the central army has approached Fuzhou, and most of the bond markets have found new high prices. Large households such as numbers 15, 35, and 46 have sold out, among which number 46 has sold out the most, but it still feels like the supply is not meeting the demand, no different from trying to quench thirst with poison. Because numbers 16, 54, and 75 are in extremely high demand, coupled with the fact that northern merchants and scattered households are buying one after another, the pressure on number 46, although great, is completely ineffective. The trend already has the form of a short squeeze, and the future may not see an immediate decline. Yesterday morning's opening saw a strong rising trend at first. Troop reduction rushed out to 65 yuan, and the rising momentum slowed down slightly after entering the market. After the salt tax, it was slightly smaller by one or two jiao. The second round only saw the compilation and troop reduction slightly smaller by three or four jiao. After that, the rising trend turned again, the market saw a surge in demand, and the bond markets rebounded by two or three jiao to seven or eight jiao. In the afternoon opening, number 75 was particularly eager to cover short positions, and number 16 shorted the period. The rising trend was still strong, only the salt tax, etc., saw a slight stabilization. The rest rose again by several jiao to one yuan or more. At the close, which was after 6 o'clock, the transaction was still quite active. Number 46 was selling more and more courageously, but the entering households did not show any weakness. Only two or three kinds in the middle of each bond market were slightly stable, and the rest were still rising. After the salt tax, it was three, four, or five jiao higher. The overall trend of the day was that, on the one hand, short positions were eager to cover, and on the other hand, there were many short period dropouts. Therefore, although number 46 had huge sales, the table was not affected. The total amount of account deposits in each bond still has four thousand million, and the future trend of squeeze is still great. The walls on both sides are entirely dependent on the support of the situation. As a result of the market price, the troop reduction continued to rise by 1.67 yuan, which was the most. The rest also rose by several jiao to 1.45 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 35 million yuan.</p>
<h3>New York Bonds Reach New Highs</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company's 10th report said that the New York stock market was settled with the US dollar and commercial news was favorable to the bulls, including Roosevelt's report approving the establishment of a fund to pay off railroad debts. It rose by several jiao to four yuan. All kinds of bonds except US Treasury bonds have reached new highs. The total daily transaction was 1.42 million shares. According to the Steel Century report, the steel workload is now 31%. It is expected that due to the accumulation of demand from the automobile industry and the railway, there will be major progress before April. However, there is also the possibility of an increase in lowering before there is progress. The current workload is maintained by obtaining semi-finished products to supply factories, so it is not enough to measure the reduction in consumer demand. (Wheat) the market situation has been strong for several days, making transportation easier, and sellers are discouraged, and the situation has a continued high tendency. (Cotton) the government throws out to absorb when it rises, and the public still sees high, because of the good development in legislation, and the currency will be stabilized in the short term, which increases confidence. An expanded buying movement is now waiting for the market to react. Jin Shanhou Club's purchase price of gold per tael is 34.06 yuan, which remains unchanged. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>The Help of Winning Cotton in the Bidding of Yarn</h3>
<p>Suddenly Rebounds</p>
<p>The yarn market rebounded again, and the situation was still flat. It was reported that the situation had good news, and raw cotton rose step by step, leading to the yarn market. Moreover, the actual demand for sporadic transactions was still uninterrupted. Large-scale sales are still lacking, all affected by the drying up of finance. Therefore, the rising wind of the yarn market is weaker than that of the cotton market. Basically, it must be based on the current sales as the expansion and contraction.</p>
<h3>The Winning Bidding Rebounded by 1.61 Yuan</h3>
<p>The pre-market opening of the People's Bidding saw the market atmosphere still flat. When the auction reached the second and third rounds, the cotton market rose, and the yarn market was brought up. The buying trend was stronger, and each month rose by 7.9 jiao to 1.3 yuan. The afternoon market situation was still strong, with the recent rise of 7.9 jiao and the distant rise of 1.3 yuan. The total daily transaction statistics were 16,100 bales. It was found that the sales were Tongfu 400 bales, Jifeng 700 bales, Chunji 1,100 bales, Yuanda 950 bales, Shenji 400 bales, Dachang 550 bales, and Changji 500 bales. The purchases were Senkang 1,250 bales, Renfeng 1,450 bales, Shenji 700 bales, Tongji 400 bales, Yiyu 700 bales, and Yongda 300 bales. The closing price is as follows:</p>

<p>February 1763 Up 16 29,850 Total 126,150</p>
<h3>Sporadic Actual Needs Are Still Uninterrupted</h3>
<p>The current yarn sales are still good. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 1,261 bales throughout the day. The market price rose by 5 jiao. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Mainland 565 Shantou 60 Northern Gang 3 Jiangxi 80</p>
<p>Yunnan 240 Guangdong 210 Peers 103</p>
<h3>The Rising Wind of Cotton Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Short Positions Turned Long: New Highs Appear Frequently</p>
<p>The rising wind of the cotton market is becoming more and more intense, and new highs are appearing step by step. With the continued rise of US cotton and the firm sentiment, a part of the short amount has turned long. Therefore, the market atmosphere is particularly intense. However, yarn sales have not been very smooth, and factory needs have not been very active. The recent rising wind is inevitably too fast.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Rose by Eight and a Half Jiao</h3>
<p>In the previous market, Zheng Biao opened with American cotton rising again, and buying was still strong. Prices rose steadily, with each month increasing by five to five and a half jiao. The afternoon situation remained tight, with each month rising by another one to three and a half jiao. Total trading volume for the day was 160,900 dan. Sales were: Chang Ji 3,000 dan, Sui Long 5,000 dan, Yuan Da 8,400 dan, Yuan Da 4,900 dan, Shen Ji 2,800 dan, Da Chang 5,700 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 4,600 dan, Tong Fu 2,000 dan, Tong He 3,200 dan.

<h3>Demand for American Spot Cotton is Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market situation: due to enthusiastic buyers and good demand for spot goods, and strong support from Wall Street, prices rose. As a result, spot prices rose 10 points per pound, futures prices rose 6 to 9 points per pound. Liverpool cotton spot prices remained unchanged, futures prices rose 6 to 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 8 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to long positions being closed and a lack of buyers. As a result, Pingal and Baroach both fell one rupee, and Omra fell half a rupee. Original telegram recorded (10th telegram):</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>The Flour Market's Spirits are Excited Beyond the Norm</p>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the market for each month showed a good picture. The quotation for foreign wheat was good by about four or five jiao in Chicago, and about two jiao in Canada. In addition, manufacturers' chips for this month were gradually being collected, and people could not help but pay attention. Therefore, after the opening, both near and far spirits were seen to be firm, and transactions were also very smooth. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the market for each month had improved again. Manufacturers also continued to collect the current month, which was one cent better than in the morning. Later, the Tianjin gang temporarily took a long position, taking advantage of the high price to return the goods. Some manufacturers also cashed out long-term contracts, and the market atmosphere was slightly suppressed. However, the market's spirits were quite excited, and the market may need to rebound again. As a result, the current month rose three cents compared to the previous day, February rose two cents and seven and a half li, March rose two and a half cents, April rose two cents and two and a half li, May rose two cents, and June rose two and a half cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Recovered by Five Cents</h3>
<p>Trading was very quiet in the afternoon; empty sales were not opened for January to May</p>
<p>After the wheat futures market opened yesterday morning, the price for each month was stable. Foreign wheat quotations rebounded by two to four or five jiao. Although foreign wheat is being actively unloaded, there are very few people engaging in hedging. Therefore, people's spirits turned stable, and the opening price was good. January, February, and March were all up five cents, but trading was very quiet and there was no spirit. In the afternoon, empty sales were not opened for January to May. Only June opened a price, with no significant ups and downs. As for the current wheat market, it is still active. Yao Bay wheat opened at four yuan, and Wuhu wheat at three yuan and six jiao, totaling three thousand packages, which Fuxin handled, it is said.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Turned Stable, Thick Japonica Continued to Fall</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Sources from various gangs seem to be turning scarce, only arriving around the 20th (more than 3,000 shi). However, due to sluggish outgoing routes in recent days, accumulation in the ports is already thick, estimated at about 200 gangs (among which some have already been sold and not delivered). People's spirits are quite discouraged, and the market situation is difficult to turn around. Thick japonica from Chang Gang, Su Gang, and Nan Gang, etc., is being observed by urban and rural shops, with sales slow and forced. Sellers only have price cuts to sell, and the market has fallen by another corner. Although Du Yang tip has seen some movement, there is not much remaining stock. Yesterday, Tianjin and Weihaiwei and other gangs continued to handle nearly 2,000 packages, and the market situation seems to be stabilizing. Due to seasonal factors, Yin Bian Yuan is uniquely showing its colors, but the middle and lower grades are average.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, sources from various routes downstream of the river were more than fifty gangs. The market's various outgoing routes remained sluggish. The market shape of white japonica, Yang Du tip, Bu tip, early thin rice prices were slightly close to a corner. Bian Yin Yuan guests tip were flat and tired.</p>
<h3>Guest Indica Rice Only Had Limited Transactions in This Street</h3>
<p>Regarding yesterday's guest indica rice market, the Min Gang was hesitant to smoothly handle and load goods due to the chaotic situation in that province. Other gangs also mostly observed. The Yue Gang had newly handled and arrived in large quantities from various provinces along the Yangtze River, and had no intention of inquiring. Therefore, people's spirits immediately showed a softening trend. As a result, the sale of opened machine-milled rice was reduced by another corner, and other rice remained flat and soft. The unified market only saw this street handling 306 bags of machine-milled rice to cope with needs, priced at six yuan eight jiao six cents to six yuan seven jiao. Also, 100 bags of Zhe Jing, priced at five yuan nine jiao, and 50 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled rice, priced at seven yuan three jiao and a half. Later shapes were all seen as flat and tired. If there is a smooth outlet for local customers again, then it may turn around.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Goods</h3>
<p>Golden Vegetables, Wood Ear, and Melon Seeds Turned Up</p>
<p>Since the Min Bian incident, the majority of goods from the North have fallen due to the impact of sluggish sales. Now it is heard that the Min Bureau has a saying to end, so the main goods sold specifically to Fujian and Guangdong, such as golden needle vegetables, wood ear, and melon seeds, all turned up yesterday. If the situation is stabilized and realized, then the post-market is bound to continue to rise without a doubt. (Yesterday's report that Xinghua round occupied one-fifth was a mistake of four-fifths, hereby corrected)</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Woolen Cloth and Clothing Shops Have a Lot of Business</h3>
<p>Recently, as the weather has gradually turned cold, business in woolen cloth and clothing shops has suddenly increased. Orders for thick woolen overcoats are even more prevalent. Western clothing and men's clothing shops along Avenue Joffre, Xiaoximen, Qipan Street, Daxin Street, Sichuan Road, Wusong Road, and Nanjing Road in this port have had a large number of overcoat transactions in recent days. Among them, dotted Western-style overcoats and colorful Chinese-style overcoats are the most popular, with prices around thirty yuan each being more common. Fashionable women's clothing stores in the Xiaohuayuan area of ​​Simalu have also seen a sharp increase in overcoat business compared to before. Baodali Yuanping woolen surfaces with foreign fox fur collars are sold for 25 or 26 yuan per pair and are more widely sold than other types of goods. However, bulk wholesale transactions of woolen cloth are extremely desolate, because the clothing gangs are pushing forward the sale of existing stock and have no intention of importing new goods. Therefore, the market atmosphere of the woolen cloth guild is still as deserted as before, and there is no hope for price increases for any goods.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<h3>Flat Bundled Tinplate Arrives and Sells Well</h3>
<p>Flat bundled tinplate has been arriving in large quantities recently, so there are more than 4,000 bundles stockpiled in Qichang Warehouse, Fenhexiang and other docks. However, on the sales side, because tinplate stores have strong buying appetite, a large number of two to three thousand bundles have been sold off in recent days. The price of the top-grade goods is 24 yuan per box (calculated as 200 pounds), the second-grade is 22 yuan, the third-grade is 20 yuan, and the fourth-grade is 18 yuan and 5 jiao. Although it has not improved compared to before, a good atmosphere is something that other tinplate cannot hope for.</p>
<h3>English Steel Plate Sales Decline</h3>
<p>The sales of English steel plates have declined recently, because the customer gangs have shown a state of stagnation, manufacturers are not purchasing much, and transactions are unusually deserted. The market price of 2% can be sold for 10 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, ½ cent for 9 yuan, 7½ li for 7 yuan and 9 jiao and a half, and 1 cent for 7 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Chinese and Foreign Silk Markets Share the Same Ills</h3>
<p>(Overseas raw silk is extremely sluggish) Japan had a bumper silkworm cocoon harvest last year and silk production increased sharply. It actively developed overseas silk sales. Japanese silk was dumped at low prices in European and American markets. However, the sales of silk fabrics were sluggish. Silk consumption by silk weaving factories in New York and Lyon decreased significantly. Since the beginning of the year, exports of Japanese silk have been extremely sluggish. The price of Yokohama ordinary raw silk has fallen below the 500 yuan (Chinese currency) mark. The opening prices for Japanese silk in the American, French, and English markets are only at 440-450 yuan in Chinese currency, and there is no market for them.</p>
<p>(Silk factories' Changtu silk sales are gradually rising) Inland silk factories are now weaving spring silk. The sales of Changtu silk from silk factories are gradually rising. Since the beginning of the year, silk merchants in Hangzhou and Huzhou have purchased 142,250 dan of white Changtu, and are now shipping them in batches to meet the needs of weaving maoge, brocade, and damask.</p>
<p>(Rayon sales are not weak) Rayon spring sales have started, and sales are not deserted. After the new year, rayon from the Yangtze River and Yantai and Qingdao has been shipped out. (That is, the Hong Kong side also shipped dozens of boxes on the clipper Clifton yesterday. Currently, the Chang'an Xiashi gangs in the city have also purchased 40 boxes of EAK, Longlin Tower and other brands, priced from 218 yuan 7 jiao and a half to 212 yuan 5 jiao net.</p>
<p>(The silk sales in Europe and America are difficult to turn around) The silk weaving factories in Europe and America had poor business performance last year and inventories piled up. Only 40-50% of them have started this year, and all have reduced their looms. Therefore, the consumption of raw silk has decreased further. The silk in hand is enough to meet the demand. After the new year, the actual sales of red plates in New York and Lyon have not been opened. No one is asking about Chinese silk. Very few calls are being transferred to Shanghai. Silk sales in Europe and America are unlikely to turn around for a while. The market atmosphere is calm. Yellow, white, gray silks are all in a state of stagnation. There are almost no transactions to report.</p>
<h3>There is a Large Stockpile of English Black Tea</h3>
<p>According to recent news from England, the overview of the tea industry in 1933, businesses made a lot of profit in the first half of the year, but in the second half, due to the sharp increase in the production of Indian, Ceylon, and Dutch tea, market prices stepped down, and businesses suffered more losses. Currently, in the London market, the highest grade Keemun black tea has been completely sold out, but 20,000 to 30,000 boxes of medium and low grade tea from Hubei and Hunan are still in the hands of businesses. The stockpile of Indian, Ceylon, and Javanese tea is even more massive, with 150,000 dan. Judging from this situation, the situation for Chinese tea trade with England, especially for low-grade crude goods, is extremely unfavorable.</p>

<h3>Women Don't Necessarily Lie More</h3>
<p>— Zhao Lingyi</p>
<p>Mr. Shiheng in "Talking about Lying" believes that one of the reasons for lying is weakness, and the fact he cites is: "That is why women tell more lies than men."</p>
<p>That is not necessarily a lie, but it is also not necessarily a fact. We do often hear from men that women tell more lies than men, but there is no real evidence or statistics. Mr. Schopenhauer scolded women, but after his death, a prescription for syphilis was found in his books; and there was also a young Austrian scholar, I forget his name, who wrote a large book saying that women and lies are inseparable, but he later committed suicide. I am afraid that he himself had a mental illness.</p>
<p>I think, instead of saying "women tell more lies than men," it is better to say "women are accused of 'telling more lies than men' more often." However, there are naturally no statistics on the numbers.</p>
<p>For example, regarding Consort Yang, the literati after the An Lushan Rebellion all told big lies. Emperor Xuanzong was said to be carefree and uninvolved, but instead, it was said that many bad things were caused by her. How many dared to say "I have not heard of the decline of the Xia and Yin dynasties, but rather of the killing of Bao and Da"? Even Daji and Baosi were not the same? Women's taking the blame for themselves and for men is really too far-reaching.</p>
<p>This year is the "Women's National Products Year," and revitalizing national products also starts with women. Soon, they will be scolded, because national products may not improve as a result, but once they are advocated and scolded, men's responsibilities are also fulfilled.</p>
<p>A certain male reporter has a poem defending a certain lady: "The king raised the white flag on the city, how could the concubine in the deep palace know? Two hundred thousand men all removed their armor, and there was not a single man!" Splendid!</p>
<h3>Snuff</h3>
<p>— KS</p>
<p>Those who have read Mr. Zhou Zuoren's "Selected Jokes" probably feel that this gentleman who advocates moderation is becoming more and more skilled in using articles to deal with the world. Just when we are desperately fighting inside and out, Mr. Zhou has this kind of magic to deal with difficulties, making us burst into laughter in disappointment. This cannot be said to be a kind of "immeasurable merit."</p>
<p>Some people often wonder why Mr. Zhou would publish such a book. Such a fuss is really not worth arguing about. All troubled times, like the late streams of the Nine Schools during the Warring States period, and the legends of foxes and ghosts during the Northern and Southern Dynasties, were all elaborate formations set up by the literati of the time in a helpless situation. To say it is passive, it contains an optimistic attitude; to say it is optimistic, it is completely irreverent world-weariness. However, Mr. Zhou has not reached the point of abolishing the fame of the monarch, and he can actually write a biography of Mr. Mo Xu You: Mr. Zhou is determined to put on the face of a professor, but he will never publish a "Selected Jokes."</p>
<p>Speaking of Mr. Fei Ming's Biography of Mr. Mo Xu You, I seem to remember an article by Mr. Liang Bingxian in a certain publication, which sold very well in Peiping. Almost every student in the liberal arts department of a certain university had "one article in hand." The reason why it had such a circulation, in my opinion, is because of Mr. Zhou's great promotion (see the preface to the Biography of Mr. Mo Xu You), and because in the "strict" social life of Peiping, overly spicy and salty ingredients are not allowed, so Mr. Fei Ming rubbed a pinch of snuff for them and opened a special case in literary history. This may be what Mr. Zhou thought should be greatly praised.</p>
<p>The Biography of Mr. Mo Xu You is not only a pot of snuff, but the scattered nature of the article deserves a hundred strokes on the buttocks. Refined scholars will smile knowingly, precisely because Mr. Fei Ming is not incapable of writing good articles, but he knows how to act cute, how to "break the rules." People who know how to "break the rules" can probably be regarded as morale, at least they are a head taller than those love brothers and sisters. But in this day and age, there is also no way. Mr. Fei Ming is too much, and even Mr. Zhou's support may not be taking the wrong path. What is pitiful is our book buyers, who take out a few cents to smell a pinch of snuff, which is a bit not worth it.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Zhou likes people who know how to play dumb, and our Mr. Fei Ming has actually learned to play dumb, so there is such a move; but I always think that China is not without a solution, and our literary world will not just talk about the mysteries of ghosts and gods from now on. I hope that the two of them will withdraw this effort.</p>
<h3>Lying and Hunanese Stupidity</h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>There is a saying in Hunan, "Deceiving the dead is not a crime," implying that lying and deceiving people is not a crime. In fact, Hunanese are very stupid, and their skills in lying and deceiving people are not very clever. Let's take a slightly more recent example from history.</p>
<p>During the Taiping Rebellion, the Manchu Qing government was about to collapse. Although the slogan of "Loyalty to the King" was shouted by the generals in command and the regional governors, the people who really bore the responsibility of "Loyalty to the King" were a few bookworms from Hunan who initially had no official responsibility or position. They took the empty slogan of "Loyalty to the King" and proclaimed themselves as "loyal and righteous people," and then they worked, worked, worked, worked even harder, worked practically, and worked quickly, doing great things regardless of everything. "Building forts and fighting to the death" was their strategy, and the words "clumsy" and "sincere" were the spirit with which they worked. Originally, the so-called "Loyalty to the King" was just a deceptive slogan shouted by the mediocre and incompetent generals of the time, but the Hunanese took it seriously. Without military power in hand, they trained local militias and completed the great feat of "Loyalty to the King." After the success, what benefits did the Hunanese get? What benefits did the Chinese nation get? They never thought about it. In the end, a few people became loyal ministers and righteous men, and most people were fooled by the so-called loyal ministers and righteous men! To this day, there are still many descendants of the Xiang Army who were stranded in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River! "Deceiving the dead is not a crime." If that is correct, then the Manchu Qing government used the ideas of loyalty between ruler and subject to deceive Zeng, Zuo, and other people, and Zeng, Zuo, and other people used these ideas to deceive their subordinates. Who says it shouldn't be? Moreover, at the time, who felt that they had heard lies and been greatly deceived? Those who were lucky enough to survive were scattered and stranded, suffering all the hardships of human life; those who were unfortunate enough to die were enshrined in the so-called Xiang Army Martyrs' Shrine, and only earned the comments of "clumsy" and "sincere." These two words are from Zeng Guofan's "Record of the Xiang Army Martyrs' Shrine." Clumsy and sincere are indeed the spirit of the Hunanese! Mr. Zeng has honestly told people.</p>
<p>After the Taiping Rebellion, every major change in China's political situation gave the Hunanese an opportunity to show their true spirit of clumsiness and sincerity. It is inconvenient to say more, just say one thing. In the Hundred Days' Reform, Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao were the main figures. When disaster struck, Kang and Liang fled upon hearing the news, but Tan Sitong refused to flee, saying that there was no political reform without bloodshed, and that the bloodshed should start with him. He did not know that the reform and transformation were originally deceptive slogans used by the so-called patriots and government officials of the time. In short, in terms of politics alone, in the past seventy or eighty years, in every major political change in China, whether positive or negative, no matter how the lies were told, the Hunanese always took them seriously. As a result, they fully demonstrated the stupidity of the Hunanese!</p>
<h3>The Barefoot Person (Plus Four Other Pieces)</h3>
<p>— Miao Chongqun</p>
<p>The barefoot person has a heavy burden on his shoulders and steps on a path covered with sharp stones. He does not hesitate, nor does he pant; every three steps, there are two shouts, which is the rhythm of "strength," the high song of "life."</p>
<p>Blood and Sweat</p>
<p>The shoe piece made of discarded rubber tires is pierced, so another patch is put on it. This is not the meaning of "If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." For a worker who is a flesh-and-blood motor, his life's blood and sweat are the diesel and gasoline needed inside the motor.</p>
<p>New Car</p>
<p>Even the newest car of 1999 is probably not much different in appearance from a coffin of 2,000 years ago. The practice of satirizing useless people in the world as walking corpses has existed since ancient times; but the fact that today people can sit in machines and fly east to west, and lie in coffins and still rush around, cannot but be said to be unprecedented.</p>
<p>The words used to satirize the useless are that they are lagging behind, but the useless are actually making great strides in enjoyment.</p>
<p>Signboard</p>
<p>The signboard of an old drugstore on the west side of the street reads "Gao Nianchu." On the window facing the street is written: "This shop is the only one; there are no descendants elsewhere." But there is a plaster shop on the east side of the street whose signboard reads "Old Nianchu." There are no words on the window facing the street.</p>
<p>I think this wordless advertisement is better than the one with words.</p>
<p>I remember that Lu Gaojian, who sold stewed pork in Shanghai, and Wang Mazi, who sold scissors in Beijing, although there were seven or eight shops on the same street, each of their signs added the words "Genuine." It may not be possible to make customers believe that they are genuine. On the contrary, because they are all "genuine," people suspect that they are all false.</p>
<p>If a signboard advertisement does not have the quality of promoting oneself while demeaning others, then it loses its purpose; but the owner of the plaster shop on the west side of the street originally wanted to be clever, but in the end he scolded himself.</p>
<p>However, there are fewer fools these days after all. Signboard advertisements are actually superfluous. It is enough to be able to pass off fish eyes as pearls.</p>
<p>Mourning | Celebration |</p>
<p>In the evening, I heard the heavy footsteps of many people in the alley, and they were all shouting together: Mourning | Celebration | Mourning | Celebration | It sounded like they were carrying something heavy. | I wonder who died again. My wife said.</p>
<p>| What?</p>
<p>| The coffin bearers.</p>
<p>I often think that death is a transcendent matter, but it seems troublesome to have to sleep in such a heavy coffin. I couldn't bear it and told my wife:</p>
<p>| When I die, don't bother with a coffin. A naked burial is best :::::::::::::::</p>
<p>Listening to the sound of Mourning | Celebration | Mourning | Celebration | going away, my wife didn't say anything.</p>
<p>| The coal carriers and dung carriers all shout "Mourning | Celebration |" when they walk. A person's death must also be a piece of goods.</p>
<p>| No, that was a coffin being carried empty.</p>
<p>Later, when I encountered a funeral procession on the street, I noticed that the pallbearers were silent and not shouting anything. The coffin was heavy enough, and there was even a person inside :::</p>
<p>Death is quite serious in itself, isn't it? But I think it's good to shout like that; they are shouting "Mourning," and at the same time following it with "Celebration." It seems that both sides of a person's meaning are there.</p>
<h3>A Wife's Desire</h3>
<p>— Scholar Z [?] Modern Celebrity Paintings Zhang Shutong, alias Goufo, from Songjiang, editor of this publication. My girlfriend "Broken Goose, Scattered Flock" part two. Wei Da XX:</p>
<p>The sun weakly hung on the western rooftops, it was already dusk. I was drowsily pushed out of the steps of the Paris Theater; a gust of cold wind came head-on, and I shivered. I greatly regretted sacrificing my rare holiday, and the result was the opposite of my initial intention for entertainment. In order to eat, I was working so hard that I barely had time to breathe. Today, I unexpectedly gained a day off, and I pondered how to spend this day without wasting it. First, I opened today's newspaper, which was originally my daily task, but today I only flipped through two theater advertisements and was seduced by a huge advertisement, which was "Eternal Regret" being performed at the Paris Theater. I happily walked alone towards Avenue Joffre, haven't been close to her for half a year, and revisiting this old place made me feel especially cordial; however, many of the familiar storefront signs were dimmed by rain and wind, and the small trees by the road were also quietly fluttering yellow leaves, no longer waving in the wind as they did when we used to meet. Only six months apart, and the scenery has completely changed, no wonder the fate of us humans, the creatures of all things, is even more unpredictable? However, my heart was pulled by "Eternal Regret" and I still walked slowly westward, finally reaching the entertainment venue that I had also been separated from for half a year. I squeezed into the crowd, and just like six months ago, I bought a downstairs ticket at the ticket counter. That ticket collector, wearing a royal uniform, XX, is the child you said was very likable. He seemed to recognize me, or maybe because I didn't have any familiar companions beside me, he didn't dare to greet me. Originally, there are many people with similar faces in the world - you told me that once you mistakenly recognized a strange boy as me in the French Park because that boy had some resemblance to me; in fact, you were thinking about me always sitting in that pavilion, and as long as the boy's back wasn't too different from mine, you were probably going to think it was me. So today - I fantasize, if you and the boy mistaken for me came together, that very likable child would definitely recognize the boy as me too. XX, how much more nonsense is this, you probably don't like listening to this anymore, right?</p>
<p>I walked in as if nothing had happened, and sat down in the corner that we often occupied. Today is so lonely, my situation half a year ago is like the fiery summer progressing to the bleak winter, making people afraid to recall the sweet dreams of the past: I dare not even look up to assess the couples who are holding hands and coming in. I am not jealous of them, nor do I envy them, I feel sorry for them, perhaps six months later they will similarly fall into an ice cellar like me; although calculating by their time, half a year later will be the fiery summer.</p>
<p>XX, she used to watch movies and often forgot the title of the film when she left the house. Today, I thought, I could watch this sad "Eternal Regret" from beginning to end completely. The electric lights dimmed, and before my eyes was a pitch black. I forgot that I was in a movie theater. I thought I had stepped into a dark world, and I became frightened and held my eyes with both hands, not daring to open them secretly for two hours.</p>
<p>Now I was awakened by the cold wind and saw the male and female leads embracing and kissing on the wall. I regretted wasting a rare holiday like this, and the cost of sixty cents was also sacrificed in vain - saying it myself is unbelievable, my temperament has become so stingy in the past six months, I used to not even be able to remember the title of the film, but now I don't even feel relieved when spending twice the price. The changes in human beings are truly unpredictable!</p>
<p>After being pushed out for a while by the tide of people, the pace of the crowd gradually slowed down, and I walked forward with my head buried low, naturally not as interested as when I came. Beside a tram stop, I unintentionally saw a beautiful window display. XX, six months ago, we often chewed ice in that exquisite booth, unaware that it was already late at night. Now, under the bright neon lights, it is a newly opened fashion company. I wonder if that chubby shop owner is still smiling so broadly? Thinking of him, I thought of my girlfriend, we last parted ways here. She said that her mother in Tianjin was seriously ill, and she had to go back to visit her mother whom she hadn't seen for three years. We parted ways so reluctantly; I clearly remember my last sentence was: "I don't know if we will have a chance to meet again in the future?" My girlfriend's answer was a smile, and at the same time she tightly grasped my palm.</p>
<p>Now six months have passed, and she still hasn't returned - or maybe she has already arrived in Shanghai. I bless her not to have her virgin heart swallowed by the devil, and I bless her mother in Tianjin to be forever healthy!</p>
<p>When I returned, I felt like I had lost my heart! XX, I regret wasting a rare holiday, and also sacrificing sixty cents in vain, what I got in return was a heartbroken heart!</p>
<p>Let's talk next time. XX, I bless you like I bless my girlfriend!</p>

<p>Every one of my toes is slightly swollen, purple-red, like early stage frostbite; sometimes they are numb at night, probably an early symptom of this numbness disease.</p>
<p>I am very panicked because I have never had this disease before, and I absolutely don't know how it will develop in the future, and what kind of dangerous coercion it will add to my life. I couldn't find out anything from the old prisoners' mouths, they only comforted me with words like "it's okay" and "it doesn't matter", and I couldn't get any guarantees for the future.</p>
<p>This disease has been prolonged for four or five months. I discovered and noticed it when I was in the South Prison, and at that time I was extremely terrified, as if my life could not be extended for long. Although I wanted to hide all the pain I felt from my family, I tried every possible way to request a registered letter to report all the details to them. After Wu Mei told me about the blow that my family had suffered, I myself wondered why I clearly knew the result that would happen but I didn't have the courage to avoid this result, and overcome that momentary impulse?</p>
<p>The heart of a prisoner is so fragile - he wants to accept all the suffering while enduring quietly and not let those who are thinking of him know, but in a certain moment he reveals all the secrets he wants to keep in detail, and sometimes even exaggerates to tell people. The heart of a prisoner is so fragile,</p>
<p>But this fragility of the heart is due to the fragility of life, life in prison has very little guarantee. The fragility of life also has another reason - that is, due to too little exercise and too bad nutrition. These are the two demons in prison, the demons of the prisoners - under their rule, all the prisoners are infected with diseases, stomach problems, numbness, lung disease, softening disease, all kinds of diseases that would not occur in better environments.</p>
<p>My father brought a bottle of Tiger Bone Papaya Wine because my feet were numb, and wrote a report to the second section chief to request it to be issued. He approved it, saying - "There are other medicines for treatment, alcohol is prohibited by the prison regulations."</p>
<p>Indeed, this clinic with more than ten medical officers, with red, green, yellow, and pink powders, has a regulated time and a regulated number of people for seeing a doctor twice every week - even ordinary free people have never had such close contact with doctors and medicine, but this close contact is actually proof of a terrible state. And the doctors and medicine that are closely related are also terribly bad.</p>
<p>When we were led to the clinic by the squad leader, one by one we walked to the doctor's table - "Six hundred and sixty-six" - the prisoner first said the number, the doctor wrote quickly, silently, looking at me with two human eyes - "Chest swelling::: Head:::" The prisoner's condition had not even finished speaking, but his prescription was written first and handed to you. He was still silent, at most saying - "Try eating it, it's probably effective." On that prescription, 30% to 50% was aspirin, baking soda, or quinine - this seemed to be a medicine that could cure all diseases.</p>
<p>The illnesses of twenty or thirty people were all concluded in a few minutes, at most less than ten minutes, under such rapid observation. Outside doctors spend more time on one person than this doctor spends on twenty or thirty prisoners. Such a brilliant doctor.</p>

<p>American Film Contests are a Cause of Cruel Disappointment Luo Kai Contest-Winning Women Ultimately Face the Danger of Abject Failure</p>
<p>Yesterday's article spoke of the cruel disappointment caused by various film election contests. What is most shocking is the astonishing number of people who are disappointed as a result (in the most recent contest, the victory of one person led to the disappointment of more than six thousand eight hundred people). Let's now talk about the situation on the winners' side. Although they are victorious once, they still fear failure in the end, and are more likely to fail. The most terrible thing is that these people who win in the contest are almost uprooted from their old lives, making them unable to be replanted. Therefore, these people, once they arrive in Hollywood, become part of the unemployed masses of Hollywood. They would rather starve to death in Hollywood than return to their hometown and survive. Before they go to Hollywood, they first let everyone know that they have already ascended to the sky and become stars, but after a miserable defeat, they are too embarrassed to return to their hometown to see their parents because they exaggerated too much before.</p>
<p>However, the producers cannot be entirely blamed. The various election contests they launch are almost all genuine. They also spend a lot of money, often ending up with nothing. And those women who win are also given all kinds of conveniences by the company to enable them to enter the door of success. But for many years since the invention of sound films, not a single actor who has come from election contests can be considered a success.</p>
<p>Everyone always thinks that joining a contest is a shortcut to the glory of film, but the reality is not so. But going from the stage to the screen has repeatedly proven to be a convenient path. Recently, Paramount Pictures held several contests across the United States to find Alice in Wonderland's Alioo. A total of seven thousand people were selected for hour-long auditions, but none of them were qualified. In the end, they found a female actress named Charlotte Henry in a small theater. Because she had experience in front of the camera and could act, she was selected on the first try. Other companies have also had similar experiences.</p>
<p>Whether a new actor looks good on camera is not about appearance or intelligence, but about talent. Once, ten university students were selected in a contest and sent to Hollywood, but they could not get on camera. They lingered in Hollywood for a year and were unwilling to return to school. To this day, they still do odd jobs in Hollywood to make a living. As for the beautiful women who are sent to Hollywood from all over the place, the number is even greater. Once they arrive in Hollywood, they are unwilling to go home. Most of them hang out in the extra ranks. After a year or two, they live a life of one meal full and two meals hungry. The smiles of the past have disappeared, youth has passed, and clothes have become ragged. The cruelty of the results often makes people afraid to delve into them. From this, it can be seen that smart and beautiful women are more likely to mislead themselves.</p>
<p>Here are two mottos from women who have participated in contests. One is said by Tucille Lund, "the number one in the United States." She said: "I feel very honored to be able to win an opportunity to succeed, but what I have won is only an opportunity. The rest depends on the future." Another contest winner said: "No matter how you win or lose, never kick away the bridge after crossing the river. If you win, don't throw away the return ticket. It is best to tell your friends that you are just going to Hollywood to play and will be coming home soon. That way, when you come home, you won't feel embarrassed." Film Review: "Filial Piety Under Heaven" Wang Fei The Silver Cord</p>
<p>American films generally take love as the subject of comedies, while the subject of tragedies often adopts ethical stories.</p>
<p>Not long ago, we saw an outstanding ethical film, "Mother's Hate". It intertwined motherly love, love, and love of country in a planned way, and the result was that the concept of the nation took the first victory, and the male lead died in Europe. Then, the mother's resentment was finally overcome by love, and she welcomed her daughter-in-law and grandchildren to live with her. Now we see this "Filial Piety Under Heaven" again.</p>
<p>"Filial Piety Under Heaven" only writes about the conflict between motherly love and love. Love of country is not involved. It is truly a universal phenomenon, when a man gets married, his intimacy with his wife often exceeds that with his parents. Therefore, how unhappy are parents when their children, whom they have raised so hard, become estranged from them and intimate with others? Even if the one who is intimate with them is their daughter-in-law. Especially mothers, their resentment is even greater. In Chinese society, we often see old women instigating their sons to alienate their daughters-in-law, but what is the origin of this concept? We cannot but mention the family system. The establishment of the family system is to isolate people from relationships outside the family. And the closest person in the family is of course the son. Now that the son has a more intimate wife, the mother has lost her intimate son. Especially elderly widows, their social relationships are even fewer. Once their intimate son becomes estranged from them, their feeling of loneliness and sadness is naturally even deeper. If the family system is truly broken, or if the relationships between people in society are made closer, this phenomenon will naturally decrease or disappear.</p>
<p>Human beings have emotions, and human beings have been accustomed to the family system for too long. Ethical films are able to move people because of these things, but the harm of incorrect ethical films is also in these things. At present, Chinese films have a tendency to develop into ethical films, and this point cannot be ignored. Earning the tears of wives doesn't mean much!</p>
<p>Because it is an ethical film, the director naturally follows the content, so the rhythm of this film is relatively slow and calm; especially the scenes of deep thought and worry. All of its colors are able to express this point, or perhaps this is the advantage! Review of "Barbarian Travels" Ling He</p>
<p>It is indeed not easy to make a truly successful film under the conditions of small capital. Therefore, small companies must struggle under these various conditions and strive for progress with all their strength, otherwise they will inevitably suffer extremely cruel failures.</p>
<p>After watching "Barbarian Travels", there should be sincere advice to the Happy Forest Company.</p>
<p>We absolutely do not ignore the difficulty of small-capital production, precisely because of this, it must be done with a down-to-earth attitude. For example, not seeking luxurious scenery, shooting more outdoor scenes, and keeping costumes simple, etc., are all ways to save money. Therefore, it is possible to adopt realistic themes from rural areas, and with an extremely faithful attitude, make every effort to make the film a description of real life. In this way, although it is a difficult business, it has unlimited potential.</p>
<p>To explain it more clearly, the film must become a sketch of real life. Only a description that is more real than real life can make real audiences have a real-life connection and have real feelings for the work. In this way, even a relatively simple work can still gain the sincere support of a wide audience.</p>
<p>There is a prerequisite here, which is to strive for the authenticity of the work. For example, in the present day, in rural areas and even in the slums of cities, in these turbulent years, there are many stories that are worth singing and weeping about. Their lives are tragedies. Tragedies are most capable of moving people's emotions, which is already a very obvious fact, and we have no need to write tragedies as comedies. Since this is the case, simple scenery, tattered clothing, etc., all match the economic situation of small companies, and become the best production conditions.</p>
<p>However, the Happy Forest Company, like other small companies, abandons extremely advantageous methods and insists on using clever methods to film incoherent barbarian films, making the film a self-deceiving thing and causing the audience to feel disgusted. This is not only a failure in business, but more importantly, a failure in reputation.</p>
<p>The production motive of "Barbarian Travels" is undoubtedly entirely due to the ridiculous combination of stealing a few segments of foreign animal films to make a story. This is already considered dishonest in terms of production attitude, not to mention the random combination of a few segments, which is even more laughable to knowledgeable people. Can't so-called dwarf countries or black countries even deceive children? In this way, it is even more impossible to make people have a real sense of life. As for the childish and incoherent places in the content, I really don't want to point them out one by one.</p>
<p>Well, let's not say much about the evaluation of "Barbarian Travels". I sincerely advise the authorities of the Happy Forest Company not to think that opening up supernatural films is a good opportunity for small companies, and quickly wake up and strive to make real films. Jin Yan and Wang Renmei Get Married</p>
<p>The first memorable thing in the Chinese film industry in 1934 was the marriage of the two major stars, Jin Yan and Wang Renmei, at 1:00 PM on January 1st. The news of their marriage was announced prominently and suddenly, but in fact, they entered the path of love after cooperating. Because they are figures with considerable status in the Chinese film industry, people generally imagine that their wedding must be very grand, but in fact, on the night of their wedding, they simply took advantage of the opportunity of the New Year's party held by the United China Film Production Company to complete the wedding ceremony. Because they declared that they would not have a tedious wedding ceremony and spend money, their colleagues did not prepare gifts, but simply bought some food together for everyone to eat. Jin Yan and Wang Renmei also didn't have any formal attire, they simply wore the usual blue cloth gowns, and the bride, Miss Renmei, was still barefoot. When the wedding ceremony was held, there was no music, but the male and female colleagues sang the wedding march together, and Sun Yu officiated the wedding, saying a few interesting words. This wedding ceremony was considered complete. To ordinary people, this kind of wedding may be said to be too ordinary, but in fact, if you think about it quietly, their kind of wedding ceremony does have its extraordinary significance. The Vicissitudes of Several Female Stars Shi Chun</p>
<p>These many old Hollywood stars who once had great reputations in the past, perhaps many people can still remember their names. Although they were once prominent old seniors in the film industry, they have ultimately been forgotten. Even if someone can remember them, they are old and no longer able to work hard. Therefore, these many old stars who are eager to return inevitably feel a hundred and twenty points of sorrow in their hearts.</p>
<p>Ella Hall was indeed a red-hot star in Hollywood fifteen years ago, and she had captivated countless fans. When she married Immo Leslie Johnson (also a popular figure in Hollywood), she temporarily left the film industry. Now, she has three children. She remembered the glory of the past and came to Hollywood again, but the current Hollywood no longer recognizes the red star of fifteen years ago. After she arrived in Hollywood, even the smallest jobs were difficult to find. Who recognizes that she was the old star of fifteen years ago?</p>
<p>Mildred Davis, the wife of Rock, had great reputation in the past, and she was often seen in Rock's comedies. Now she has also rested for six or seven years and has come again. Her previous reputation is difficult to make an echo. So, even though Rock tried his best, she only got a small role playing a wife or mother. That was still because of Rock's big face!</p>
<p>Feda Brownson's reputation was also not small ten years ago. But now she has been looking for work in Hollywood for two years and has not been able to obtain a suitable position. Miss Clark has now changed her name to Mrs. Harley Wilkinson. She wants to return to work but cannot. Dada Barra was an old monster in the film industry ten years ago, and has now returned, but she also cannot get a position. Her husband is a director in Hollywood, but he is still helpless about his wife's position. Many people here are very resentful of marriage. They believe that if they had not married, their position would never have been lost. The Cat and the Fiddle: Film, Novel, and Song (3) Mo Chen</p>
<p>Dad stopped to listen, only to hear Victor continuing to say frantically: "I am willing to give up all music:: all art:: all success:: to exchange for her smile. I can do without all wealth and fame. What do those count for? Because I have already found love today!" Dad smiled. For many years, his heart had not received what the young man was feeling now. However, he still had some memories of the past desires. Youth and love are the two most glorious things! For a woman's smile, everything can be given up. So he said to Victor: "Your song? Play it for me."</p>
<p>Victor played the song, but in the end, what interested Dad was not Victor's song, but Shirley's song. It happened that Shirley came. When she arrived at the entrance of the music academy, Victor was still playing his tune. Dad saw Shirley and quickly stopped Victor, saying: "Okay, okay, your little operetta, I can perform it in the future, but you need to add a few more songs, great songs:: songs that the whole city of Paris will hum!" Then he turned around and said to Shirley: "What about you? Miss, let me listen to your song." He smiled at her, but Shirley said slowly: "I came to Professor Bertier to study music." She knew that she had messed up Victor's matter, and her tears were about to fall. She understood that if she didn't come, Dad's eyes wouldn't be focused on her alone. This is just because she is a woman, she thought bitterly in her heart, men are always so infatuated with women.</p>
<p>But Victor persuaded her from the side: "Shirley:: you should still play your song." The two of them looked at each other, and at that moment, they both understood in their hearts how much they were in love with each other. Shirley smiled, she realized that whoever succeeded first or whoever succeeded later didn't matter. They could be partners:: lovers:: helping each other. And that middle-aged theater manager, who is now flirting with her, might as well use him as a bridge on the road to success. She said she was sitting down, played a beginning, and then she sang softly, love rising and falling in her chest, making her voice extra gentle and charming. She was originally singing for Victor, but Dad listened and felt his heart like spring leaves fluttering in the breeze. For many years, his heart had not been stirred by a woman. Now her youth made him feel young too. Her beauty made him stop breathing, and he was pondering the sweet longing of the old days. "Then the night was made for love" She looked into Victor's eyes and sang tenderly.</p>
<p>“Thenightwasmadeforlove“She sang softly and lingeringly. That was truly impossible. But after some time, that song had become a sensation throughout Paris and had become a love song in everyone's heart! But after some time, they could no longer keep it secret and possess it privately, but after some time, it belonged to the whole world. And the money rolled in, covering Shirley and Victor. But Victor always felt that it didn't rightfully belong to him. Paris's gorgeous apartment:: imported cars:: servants serving him in every way he desired:: exotic flowers in vases, fresh fruits in bowls:: weren't those all bought with Shirley's money!

<h3>Anecdotal Metaphors (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Cheng Zhengkui requested He Shengzhai to inscribe a painting of cabbage and taro by Shi Gong. The metaphors employed were particularly ingenious, and each one was readily understood, making it a masterpiece among anecdotal metaphors. The inscription read: "Shi Gong does not chant praises atop the bell tower but insists on planting vegetables beneath the bed. It's akin to a drowsy man contemplating catching biting lice. My brother's environment inspires emotion, unable to restrain himself, suddenly bursting forth with local scenery, a momentary liberation. Unfortunate timing, unnecessarily troubling unrelated individuals with forced judgment, pointless, pointless." This anecdotal metaphor can be described as "Buddhistic."</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>Xu Fang replied to Huang Shian, saying: "Your letter has been pondered over repeatedly, and a gust of bitter wind and pouring rain seem to descend. Not only what is explicitly stated, but also what is not, can be understood through implication. Alas! We are, in this era, a kind of miserable entity in this world, like wild vegetables, gourds, grass, tea, or tannin bark; our inherent nature is fixed and unchangeable." The words "pondered over" are cleverly used, and the metaphor of "a gust of bitter wind and pouring rain seem to descend" not only enhances the literary style but also adds a special weight to the emotions. Moreover, there's the phrase "understood through implication"? The metaphor of "miserable entity" and so on is extremely fitting. I say, "miserable entity" is not only Xu Fang; we, born hundreds of years later, are we not all "miserable entities"? Looking at that era through this letter, one cannot help but be filled with emotion.</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>Xu Fang also had a letter to Zhang Wuzhong, which used very clever metaphors, with elements echoing the previous text: "Today, there are plenty of people with fat skin and thick flesh under heaven, but our few brothers are afflicted with thin bones. Wuzhong's poverty cannot protect even a bit of meat from the heron's claws, and my own clumsiness seeks to scrape off excess gold from the tip of a sundial needle. Laughable, yet also lamentable." Judging from this, we are not only "miserable entities" with him but also want to be "heron's claws" with him. Even without meat, we are still to be eaten. Alas, alas!</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (83)</h3>
<p>— By Guy de Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>This is no longer a spiritual, tormenting pain, but rather the madness of a homeless animal, a material anxiety of a vagabond exposed to rain, wind, storms, and all the fierce forces of the world. Upon boarding this steamer, upon squeezing into this small cabin rocking on the waves, the body, accustomed to sleeping on a fixed, secure bed, revolted against the future's uncertainty. Until now, this body had felt secure in the conviction of solid walls rooted to the earth and a roof overhead providing shelter from the wind. But now, everything we enjoyed in the warmth of a closed dwelling had become a danger, an eternal torment.</p>
<p>There was no more land beneath one's feet, but only the flowing, roaring, engulfing sea. There were no more places to stroll, run, or get lost, but only a few meters of wooden planks, upon which one walked like a prisoner among other inmates. There were no more trees, gardens, streets, or houses, but only water and clouds. And he would constantly feel the great ship tossing beneath his feet. During storms, he had to lean against the walls, hold onto the doorframes, and grip the edges of his narrow bunk to avoid rolling onto the floor. On calm days, he would hear the resounding vibrations of the engine and feel the ship carrying him rushing onward, a ceaseless, rhythmic, and infuriating rush.</p>
<p>And he was sentenced to this life of wandering convict simply because his mother had yielded to the caresses of a man.</p>
<p>He walked forward, now weakened by the melancholy nostalgia common to those leaving their homeland.</p>
<p>He no longer felt that arrogant contempt, that scornful hatred for the strangers passing by. Instead, he felt a desire to speak to them, to tell them he was leaving France, to have them listen to him and comfort his loneliness. He felt a shameful need, like that of a pitiable worm reaching out its hand, a shy yet strong need to feel that someone was saddened by his departure.</p>
<p>He thought of Malosko. Only this old Pole truly loved him and could feel genuine heartache. So, the doctor decided to visit him.</p>
<p>As he entered the small shop, the pharmacist, who was grinding some powders in a large marble mortar, paused slightly, startled, and put down his work.</p>
<p>"Don't you ever come out anymore?" he said.</p>
<p>The young man explained that he had been busy with various errands and requests but did not explain the motives behind them. He sat down and asked, "So, how's business?"</p>
<p>Business was bad. Competition was fierce, and in this working-class area, patients were few and poor. Only cheap medicines could be sold here; the doctors here never prescribed those rare and complex medications that could earn five times the profit. The honest man concluded:</p>
<p>"If this situation continues for another three months, I'll have no choice but to close up shop. If I weren't counting on you, my good doctor, I would have gone out to shine shoes long ago."</p>
<p>Bier felt deeply saddened and suddenly decided to deliver the fatal blow, as it was unavoidable:</p>
<p>"Ah! I: : I: : I can no longer help you. I will be leaving Le Havre at the beginning of next month."</p>
<p>Malosko was terrified and took off his glasses, saying:</p>
<p>"You: : You: : What are you saying?"</p>
<p>"I'm saying I have to leave, my poor friend."</p>
<p>The old man was dumbfounded, unable to speak for a long time. He felt that his last hope had crumbled, and he suddenly developed a resentment toward the man he had followed, the man he had liked, the man he had trusted, and who was now abandoning him.</p>
<p>He stammered:</p>

<h3>"The Soul of Wang Di"</h3>
<p>— Lizhai</p>
<p>In the political history of the Republic of China, the one that combines the characteristics of "evil seed" and "source of trouble" should of course be Mr. Puyi. Now, I hear that this treasure is going to be "emperor" again. I, in my humble opinion, do not "extol the sage" but want to "discuss" him.</p>
<p>The Xinhai Revolution was originally a "premature" "miscarriage". The so-called "Republic" was actually a "new opening of an old shop" with a change of soup but not of medicine. Yuan Shikai was bad because he himself wanted to have the "southern facing" addiction. He had to use four million of the people's fat and cream "preferential treatment" annuity to ask Mr. Puyi to rest for a few years. Otherwise, if Old Yuan had "given his all" for the national enemy like Zeng Guofan, Beijing, the ancient city of the setting sun, would probably not have encountered the misfortune of "the aura of kingship fading" twenty-three years ago. Therefore, Yuan Weiting later, as the head of the Republic, still used memorials to "respectfully wish for His Majesty's long life", and stated: "Only the honored title is retained, still constantly on my mind!" This was too impolite but still contained three parts of "hidden pain."</p>
<p>The root of the disaster that was preserved after the "revolution" has been roaming in Beijing, in that "small city circle inside a big city circle" - marrying wives and concubines, indulging in homosexual relations, causing scandalous notoriety.</p>
<p>Zhang the Braided and "Sage Kang" first stirred Puyi's thoughts, thus creating the farce of the restoration in the sixth year of the Republic. The geta friend has always been like Lu Buwei to Prince Yiren, seeing Puyi as "this rare commodity is worth hoarding". Since the beginning of the Republic, he has been constantly concerned and inquiring, with continuous gifts and greetings. In addition, not only those "old but not dead" remnants of the old dynasty had to rely on Puyi for food, but they even constantly created monkey-crowning farces such as "Southern Study Room," "On Duty," and "Court Audience" in the Xinhua Gate of the Republican capital. Even our celebrity Hu XX went to call out "Your Majesty" a few times. "Socialist master" Dr. X even complimented Puyi, saying that "the abdicated emperor is wise and has a promising future!" These facts show the characteristics of China's political nurturing of tumors and leaving behind problems, and that some people are intentionally or unintentionally carrying out the work of fanning the ashes and taking warmth for themselves.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Huanzhang was originally a straightforward person on the stage of the Republic, but it is a pity that he was not thorough. When he defected back to his army, drove away Cao Kun, and included Puyi, he spared a bullet when solving Li Yanqing at Tianqiao. He still allowed Zheng Xiaoxu and his followers to move the source of trouble to Tianjin, which was equivalent to leaving a most suitable puppet for the geta friend. Now, that source of trouble has changed into the "Chief Executive of Manchukuo," and will change again into the "Emperor" of "Manchukuo" (or "Manchu-Mongol State," or "Zhonghe State," or "Blank State"?).</p>
<p>Puyi's role as "Chief Executive" was originally known to the world as singing "puppet Peking opera." Now, he has been promoted from "Chief Executive" to "Your Majesty," and his political vitality will be further weakened to become a completely unadulterated "mummy"! Imagining the initial blooming of cherry blossoms, Puyi may go to Tokyo to perform a "double package case," and then the "provisional capital" will be set up in Rehe, implementing the gradual encroachment on Mongolia, Suiyuan, Chahar, and south of the Great Wall. Based on the "Zhuge's grand plan" of "giving whatever is asked for" in the past to predict the future, isn't it just letting the geta friend "swallow" it?</p>
<p>Puyi's称稱帝 is just one link in the long chain of Japan's invasion of China. What continues to unfold are many new tricks with endless desires. The result is that China's dismemberment is more profound and the outbreak of war in the Far East. The formal settlement of the problems between the Chinese and Japanese nations will come when the majority of Chinese civilians awaken and defend themselves. As for Puyi's personal fate, it is absolutely inconsequential. After the entire "Japan-Manchukuo Economic Plan" is completed, that "mummy" will inevitably be imprisoned in Tokyo, living the life of "Duke Anle" until death.</p>
<p>I remember that in the early years of the Republic, Zhu Chen, the governor of Zhejiang, desperately slaughtered revolutionaries in exchange for titles and awards from the Hongxian court. In the end, the Xinhua dream still ended, and he closed his eyes without seeing anything. A humorous gentleman wrote a eulogy: "In the boudoir, regretting making the dream of becoming a marquis, empty return to the sea, the soul of Wang Di!" The current Puyi is also because too many remnants of the old dynasty and traitors are making "dreams of becoming a marquis." As a result, they do not hesitate to send Puyi, a mixed-up kid who knows nothing but debauchery, to Japan to be the current "mummy" and future foreign ghost. History and personnel, seven times upside down and eight times mixed up, have judged Mr. Puyi's fate of "his soul still hopes to transform into a cuckoo." What else is there to say?</p>
<h3>Love and Status</h3>
<p>— Ding Ding</p>
<p>Today, Shan came to see me and talked about a teacher-student love affair that happened in their school. The school authorities are now investigating and forbidding it. It is also said that female students from different factions are advising the female student who is being pursued. "Oh! Isn't your school only elementary school? It's a bit ridiculous for female elementary school students and male teachers to start a love game." I couldn't help but exclaim after hearing Shan's words. Afterwards, I thought:</p>
<p>Love is a human instinct and also a gift from heaven. Humans should have the freedom to love. However, elementary school students are still in the budding stage of knowledge and learning. What choices can they understand? But if falling in love hinders their studies and delays their schooling years, this is undoubtedly a regrettable thing. At the same time, we absolutely dare not believe in the supremacy of love, because this is clearly a deceiving joke. Therefore, what should be considered is whether a person who is an elementary school teacher can support a family and have surplus? (It needs to be clarified here that I am not mocking that elementary school teachers are definitely unable to bear the responsibility of family finances. Women should indeed abandon the inferior habit of relying on men and rise up to jointly shoulder the economic burden of the family. But in today's society, it is still impossible. Although falling in love does not necessarily require seeking enjoyment in material aspects, at least it must ensure that life does not lead to bankruptcy, because I do not believe that one can tighten their belts after falling in love. Considering the current treatment of general elementary school teachers, they are almost starving on the podium. Do they have the strength to support a family?</p>
<p>However, in fact, there is this elementary school teacher who is in love with one of his elementary school students. In this love, there must be an interesting connection. In other words, why would an elementary school teacher who is as poor as a penniless person be worth attracting the love of an elementary school student whose knowledge is just beginning to open? This connection is "status."</p>
<p>Under the marriage arranged by parents and matchmakers in a buying and selling style, the so-called status is based on "matching family background" as the only major condition. The daughters of famous families must not marry those who do not have a "matching family background." Similarly, the descendants of successful and prosperous families must not marry those who do not have a "matching family background." Recently, modern young masters and young ladies have also set down these regulations for status: ladies who have returned from studying abroad will only marry provincial governors, ministers, chairmen, or directors. Ladies who have graduated from universities must marry foreign students. Ladies who have graduated from high school must marry university students to be happy. Ladies who have graduated from senior or junior high school are naturally thrilled to be able to marry their teachers.</p>
<p>Men naturally have similar requirements.</p>
<p>Oh! Love and status, it turns out that they already have such a close relationship!</p>

<h3>A Page from a Diary</h3>
<p>— Daitao</p>
<p>|Reading Notes on the First Day of the Lunar New Year|</p>
<p>The New Year has passed, but I still can't put down a piece of my mind. It is because the New Year of 1934 came exceptionally lively, but I was too lazy to leave any traces of pain. This, for the nation-state, is truly a lack of "praise," a shame for a tall, twenty-something-year-old citizen. So I always want to rack my brains to write for an hour, but time has passed like lightning for nine days, and my mind still only has a picture of "wanting to write." It's not good. If I delay any longer, the unique aspect of the New Year will become a phantom, and I won't talk about anything in the future. So, let's just copy a page from the diary.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>Early in the morning, as I was sleeping soundly, the newspaper vendor walked in and put a stack of newspapers on my head, pressing down on me so that I couldn't breathe. I woke up suddenly. Oh, this morning is actually the first day of the Lunar New Year. No wonder the newspaper is as thick as a chaotic yearbook. I casually flipped through it. Sure enough, in addition to the advertisements being particularly crowded, there were also more news than usual, and most of them were of profound significance. It is worthy of being the beautiful scenery that embellishes the New Year. I spent most of the day summarizing and noting down the essentials, to commemorate that I will not forget.</p>
<p>The first sheet, the entire three-page advertisements, one for Pinlang Brand Cigarettes, the second for XX Cinema's announcement of the screening of "The Fire of Youth," and the third for XX Bookstore's reprinting of Four Books in Preparation.</p>
<p>The second sheet was almost all congratulatory messages for the New Year. Among them, a famous figure, XX, prominently announced: "The country is in trouble, please excuse me for not celebrating the New Year!" After startling me, it made me laugh directly into the depths of the third watch.</p>
<p>The third sheet's single-eyed news was that Society and Education was suspended. It briefly stated that 3,800 copies of the New Year's special edition of the publication sent to subscribers were all detained by the postal inspection office, so it had no choice but to announce its suspension.</p>
<p>The fourth sheet had a lot of news, which I have summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The top headline reported on the intense battles in northern Fujian.</p>
<p>The puppet Puyi even attempted to relive his old dreams and presumptuously established a fake Manchu-Mongol imperial title.</p>
<p>Liu Guitang's troops in Zhangjiakou were plotting to destroy the railway.</p>
<p>A US representative revealed Japan's opium monopoly policy in Manchuria. (Notes by the notetaker: It would be best if the international community jointly sold opium in Manchuria and within China. How can Japan monopolize it?)</p>
<p>The fifth sheet was almost entirely lawyer advertisements, but there were also a few miscellaneous items, which I have noted as follows:</p>
<p>One engagement announcement, three marriage announcements, two divorce announcements, and one request for marriage, the main condition being that the person must have studied abroad and have a wealthy family.</p>
<p>Heavy snowfall in Beiping, an old woman froze to death in a certain alley, and an old and young male beggar froze to death on a certain road.</p>
<p>The Manqi section of the Hunan-Hubei Railway is plagued by bandits and has not yet been opened to traffic.</p>
<p>The sixth sheet was the National Medicine Weekly, and all the news was based on "preparation," with nothing remarkable to record.</p>
<p>The seventh sheet was the National Products Weekly. Nie Zengjifen personally inscribed the seven characters "Women's National Products Year Special Issue" in a solemn and elegant manner, truly a pillar from the women in the turbulent Honghu Lake of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Eighth, the results of the Women's Voice Society's election of female figures: the ancient Wu Zetian received 241 votes, and the contemporary Hu Die received 171 votes.</p>
<p>Xie Fucheng, the former warden of the First Special District Court Detention Center, embezzled prisoner rations and engaged in private malfeasance while in office, and has been investigated by the president of the Higher Second Court.</p>
<p>The Women's National Products Year automobile parade was held today, and many participants were the wives of important figures and celebrities in glamorous attire.</p>
<p>Ninth, the education column, the unrest at Jinan University has not yet ended.</p>
<p>Reading Duan Ni's 1934 literary forecast in Freedom Talk, there were many highlights, and I have noted several of them below:</p>
<p>A certain novelist's autobiography was published, about 1.2 million words long. Everything from daily life to diet was recorded in detail. However, he deeply regretted that he missed writing about swatting a fly while enjoying the cool air one summer month five years ago.</p>
<p>A certain Mr. Eight-legged essayist won the Nobel Prize in Literature because he was able to maintain the "old style." The literati in Shanghai held a grand dance party at the Paramount to celebrate.</p>
<p>New and old writers, in order to show friendship, jointly published a regular periodical, named "Saturday Afternoon."</p>
<p>A certain bookstore had a big winter sale, and new books were priced at ten pounds per yuan.</p>
<p>The tenth sheet, "Children's Year Special Issue," made me realize that this year is not only "Women's Year."</p>
<p>The four supplements were mostly the same as usual, but I found a congratulatory advertisement from Huili Ball in the film special issue, and the few large characters were written in a particularly "vigorous and powerful" manner.</p>
<p>Also, a certain theater screened "Singing and Dancing for Peace," saying there were thirteen stars and five hundred beauties. I secretly calculated it, there were enough "foreign thighs" to make a thousand, worthy of being the vanguard of the film industry in the New Year.</p>
<p>The book special issue had only one side, which was a fully modernized woman: "Holding a pet dog, welcoming the New Year."</p>
<p>After finishing the notes, I couldn't help but exclaim:</p>
<p>"Oh, how prosperous! The New Year of 1934."</p>
