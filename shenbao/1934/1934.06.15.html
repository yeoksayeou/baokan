<h3>愛國男兒鄧鐵梅被捕感言</h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>東北四省。受日軍鐵蹄之蹂躪者。已兩。年有餘。無論窮鄉僻壤。莫不爲日本統治勢力所威脅。其猶能高樹靑天白日旗。保持中華民國年號者。則爲義軍</p>
<p>活動之根據地。而吉東與安東之二大三角地帶。尤稱抗日勢力之淵藪焉。最近被人賣捕之遼寗自衛軍總司令鄧鐵梅氏。卽安東三角地帶之義軍首領也。</p>
<p>鄧氏自九一八後。卽在安東鳳城岫巖三角地帶。與鵬飛劉景文。敖錫三（卽海蛟）等部相聯合。從事抗日。每與日僞軍相接觸。輒用暗襲制勝。其地適處滿鮮交通之要道。日人視苦眼中釘。迭次進攻。迄未得逞。今年二三月起。鄧氏之活躍益甚。僞軍王殿忠部。且倒戈反正。與相結合。鄧氏乃擬更進一步。與王鳳閣。任福祥各部。乘今夏靑紗幛起。大舉起事。今不幸而出師未捷。身先被</p>
<p>捕。痛哉。</p>
<p>電訊傳來。鄧氏在獄中絕食。神色自若。一則曰。「好男見不食僞國飯。」再則曰。「義軍之活動。在遂行中國國民之責任。而反日思想。係出於愛國心。」寥寥數語。直從心坎中流出。何其眞墊乃爾。慨自民氣消沉以來。迥腸盪氣奮發惕厲之語。久焉不聞。聆此空谷足音。令人感極而涕。昔宋末文天祥氏。處燕獄。作正氣歌。有句云。「是氣所磅　。凛烈萬古存。當貫日月。生死安足論」若鄧氏者。大節泣鬼神。忠義薄雲天。可謂能繼承文作國之餘烈。而爲國人所師法者矣。</p>
<p>慷慨赴死易。從容就義難。觀於鄧氏入獄後之神情。而果死者。殆爲從容就義之死。其價値尤勝於因一時憤激而死也。譬如當兩軍作戰。金鼓相聞。砲火交接。髮指眥裂。血沸脈張。以與敵人相搏戰。先之以械鬥。繼之以肉薄或則斷脛拆臂。或則肚腦塗地。其死也。大都爲一時感情所驅使。而鮮有運用理智之餘暇。故雖難而猶易也。自九一八之變既作。倡言積極抵抗者滿天下。一待時過境遷。則氣餒神弛矣。寖假聲。色狗馬之好。富貴利祿之奉。環相引誘。迭起包圍。前後相較。且判然兩人矣。昔之以獻身救國爲樂事者。今可藉詞於人道和平而推諉矣。或歸咎於環境惡劣而解嘲矣。於是十倡百和。蒸爲習尙。知行相</p>
<p>違。漫不屑顧。其能始終於抗日救國運動生死以之如鄧鐵梅者。眞是鳳毛麟角。不數數覯。此其所以爲可貴也。</p>
<p>今敢正告國人曰。鄧氏入獄。殆無生望。其死也。實爲靑天白日旗而死。實爲中華民國年號而死。在靑天白日旗下奉中華民國年號者。舍鄧氏外。無虑數萬萬人。此數萬萬人。不盡能爲鄧氏。或不必盡爲鄧氏。然不可不明白認定者。過去如許抗日志士。皆爲我祖國而犧牲。爲我子孫而犧牲。而人類正義而犧牲者也。今鄧氏又繼如許志士而犧牲矣。我人若視鄧氏之死而一如秦人視越人之肥瘠。漠然無動於中者。則一旦亡國而後。縱有僞國飯。其足食耶。</p>

<h3>陳公博談　考察南洋經過　華僑商業衰落原因</h3>
<p>（南京）陳公博談南洋華僑年來衰敗之最大原因、據說昔土人向華僑借欵作爲資本者、息金甚爲雄厚、幾百分卅或五十之鉅、近年土人已漸靈敏、又爲其當地政府之維護、對此項放欵、已無利可圖、蓋南洋華僑可分三等、一爲大資本商人、一爲中等商人、一爲苦工、刻下大資本及勞工兩等僑胞、均勉爲維持、而中等商人前途可慮、年來吾國對南洋貿易、幾被日貨排斥殆盡、而日貨傾銷實爲奇特、某當地總督語余、有某一種日貨進口、每件納現金關稅三角、該貨在市塲價格每件僅售二角五分至二角七分、除其一切原料成本運費不計外、所售價格或較關稅尙</p>
<p>差三分或五分、此種不顧血本傾銷、百思不得其解、我國國貨推銷首須擴其市塲、尤欲與當地政府得有一種相當之交換、例如荷屬東印度對中國爲出超、菲律賓對中國爲入超、此皆政府中定有一相當之經濟了解、中國爲荷屬糖品之最大市塲、然中國貨品之入荷屬、每屬第十三、吾人急應設法、卽對匪貿易似居順境、然入數甚微且菲島市因美菲之關係、不在華而在美、倘數年後匪島完全獨立則情形自變、對菲出超、亦將勢爲入超余此次旅行各地與當地、政府討論者、首爲交換之數量問題、將來苟能照此實現則於中國之對外貿易、不無少補、現除與南洋當地政府交換意見外、并與渣華輪船商妥减輕國貨運價等等、均有相當决定、先聘專家數人作長時間之研究、然後决定國貨推銷南洋計劃、呈中央採納、救濟華僑、可謂已成過去、亦可謂無從談起、一、爲欲救濟華僑、政府財力實談不到、南洋中等華僑佔百分之七十、殊無財力救濟、二、政府表示救濟華僑、僅指新嘉坡一埠失業工人而言、現該埠失業工人已先後返國、而留住者勉有職業、亦可說已成過去事矣、陳嘉庚公司停閉、政府初願補助恢復、本人行前曾與汪院長商談過的、嗣余至新嘉坡時、該廠謂因種種外貨傾銷等關係、就政府善意作爲資助開業、亦極難持外、不願再事復業、以免將來辜負政府善意云、（十四日專電）</p>

<p>物輸入該地者數字僅佔第十一位、已與該地政府磋商一交換數量、俟研究後再决定、陳家庚廠政府本擬撥卅萬元助其復業、惟該廠尙多困難、暫難復工、南洋華僑生活、除勞工外、爲大資本商人、其餘百分之七十五均爲中小商人、殊難維持生活、本人考察所得、擬聘專家研究整理、以資改進我對南洋貿易、（十四日中央社電）</p>

<h3>談話性質重大</h3>

<p>會晤、然截至目下止、兩巨頭會晤之性質及其談話之内容、外間尙無從捉摸、所以如是者、其故有二、一因首相與德總揆親近人員對兩人會晤之内容、嚴守秘密、無論如何、不肯吐露一字、一則因兩首揆均居非常地位、其親自晤面、此又爲第一次、故會晤性質如何、殊難推測也、此次會晤之結果如何、全視會晤彼此能否發生同情而定、以會晤之環境而言亦非尋常可比、蓋第一日兩巨頭係單獨會晤、而會晤所在之阿斯特拉宮、又距城市甚遠也、總之無論會晤程序如何、兩巨頭之談話、必隨情形而變動、且其會晤程序、似有意使其寛泛者、此次會晤、由外交手續籌備已三星期之久、但吾人當知墨索里尼與希特勒二人之間、於通常外交關係之外、常有直接關係、且後者之性質、較前者爲重要、其直接關係或係由兩首揆親自派員互通往來、或則由汎繫黨與國社黨居中接洽、此外有兩種事實、間接促成此次之會晤、一爲國社黨在奥國重行活動、此爲德國方面之事、一爲法意友誼在外表上之表示、此爲意大利方面之事、由政治上言之、兩巨頭各有所挾以爲談判之具、據意大利人士言、意大利對於奥大利之態度、依然未改、其反對德國干涉奥國内政、依然如昨、如德國希望在奥國境内、與意大利平分勢力、必遭意大利之拒絕、除奥國問題以外本月八日法英美三國軍縮妥恊案所造成之局勢、當然亦在討論之列、但關於此事、絕無任何消息、惟一般人謂、此事關係甚爲重大耳意大利人士又謂此次會晤、不能視爲係對待法國者、因意政府曾於數星期之前曾以此舉非正式通知法國及英國政府故也云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>美國通過白銀法案　本市銀行界異常注意　生銀出超額殊可驚人</h3>
<p>美國白銀法案、業已正式通過、美財部卽實行購進大量白銀爲凖備金、本市銀行界已引起嚴重注意、申時社記者連日訪金融界各領袖、茲將所得各情誌次、</p>
<h3>銀案通過影響我國</h3>
<p>據經濟專家現任交通銀行經理金國寳氏表示、美國白銀法案、已於本月十二日通過、該案通過、勢必影響我國金融等各方面、按該法案之旨趣、美政府在以不超過每盎斯五角之市價下、得買進白銀、其買進最大額、可至現價凖備總額百分之二十五、卽四分之一、換言之、白銀對黃金可有一與三之比、目下美黃金凖備約有七十萬萬餘元、白銀若有三分之一、卽等於二十餘萬萬元、近來美政府陸續買進之銀數若干、雖不得而知、但美政府嘗宣稱、白銀凖備、尙不足總額百分之十五、由此推去、距其最高限度、尙有百分之十之差額、銀元成份、規定爲三七一·二五格蘭、故每盎斯等於一元二角九分、白銀二十餘萬萬元、依一元二角九分折算、約等於二十萬萬盎斯、是則由比例法計算、至少尙可買進七萬萬盎斯、因此我國所儲有限之白銀、難免不逐步被其所吸取、</p>
<h3>我國通貨勢將緊縮</h3>
<p>美國所需購進補充凖備金之白銀七萬萬盎斯、若依市價五角計算、約</p>
<p>合美金十五萬萬元左右、目下紐約銀價爲四角五分餘、將來尙可提高至五角、果成事實、則中國白銀輸出益多、物價必隨之益跌、在民國二十一年、我國白銀輸出、尙有入超三千八百餘萬元、但至去年、則以外國銀價提高之故、輸出多而輸入少、出入相抵之後、白銀出超、計達一千四百餘萬元、本年從一月至四月四個月中、出超竟達一千四百餘萬元、最近滬銀價與美國方面、已至平衡狀况若再行提高、則中國通貨緊縮將益甚、物價勢必益落、觀乎國定稅則委員會所編之物價指、數、及上海社會經濟調查所所編農產品指數之逐形低落、可爲其實之證明、</p>
<h3>征利益稅影響尙少</h3>
<p>關於美白銀法案通過後、附帶片收百分之五十之利益稅一點、據本埠銀界認爲此點於我國無甚影響、僅足將銀價暴漲之程度、稍稍緩和、同時可防止白銀賣買者之投機、故本市與香港方面白銀賣買停止期中、亦尙未受任何之顯著影響、至最近外傳匯豐運出大批現銀、據申時社記者探悉、該項現銀、計包括銀幣一千萬元、及銀條二十五萬兩三月份中亦同樣運出白銀一千四百萬兩、其目的地爲香港及印度、一部份確係轉運至僞國、作鼓鑄新幣之用、</p>
<h3>白銀貿易出超驚人</h3>
<p>據中國銀行昨發表、本年度四個月來、現銀輸出入相抵、出超額已達一三·六八零·五九二元、爲歷年來現銀出超最高記錄、計四個月來輸入額爲銀幣一·四八五·二四○元、生銀三·二六八·五二四元、共合四·七五三·八一四元、輸出額、銀幣三·五八五·二五○元、生銀一四·八四九·一五六元、合共一八·四三四·四零六元、出入相抵、計出超一三·六八零·五九二元殊可驚人、</p>
<h3>商會第五屆大會　提案審查完竣　共計會員提案卅三件　提大會討論者廿七件</h3>

<h3>藏本尋獲後　日使署對我表示感謝　電訓須磨對我表示謝忱　松井醫師前晚入京檢病</h3>

<p>昨據日文報每日新聞載稱、行將引起國際問題重大化之藏本副領事案、急轉直下、竟變爲一塲國際的滑稽戲、然藏本氏生還後、告中國方面、有「欲尋死之意」一語、而其欲尋死之動機、則謂自己一生之不遇、但渠失踪後、幾次出紫金山之洞穴、赴孝陵前之茶館、或啖中國麫瓜子菓子等品、或啜中國茶以止渴、由此點而論、渠最初顯然並無自殺之决心、更就精神狀態而言、渠於八日深更、登紫金山上、遙觀南京城中燈火輝煌、又聞獸聲、先脫去衣服、爲狼食凈、不願留下痕跡、至第二夜與猿同樣、攀登樹上等、推定其爲精神錯亂之結果、然至十三日發見時之服裝、曾遺失草帽一頂、共紐扣與領帶、亦與常人無異、不過經過六天的飢飶餓、兩頰稍瘦、鬍髭亦長、仍表示洒落態度、迨須磨總領事·有野秘書·扶出外交部大門時、頓現悲痛感慨之狀、及返總領事館、拒絕一切訪客、隱居於領館一室、綜觀此次事件、藏本以逾四十年齡之外交官、固可推定其缺乏常識、惟其行動、實爲常人想像所不及云、</p>
<h3>提案内容</h3>

<h3>引水會　力爭主權再斥謬說（續）　中國引水公會籌備會來稿</h3>
<p>爲證實此項意見、故當時白雅德仍有正式之訓令内中述及以下之事實、卽中政府防止其人民對交戰國取對敵行爲之義務、通常以該項事跡發生於該國裁判權以内者爲限、而列强則對中國因條約關係而取得治外法權者、白氏又云、唯此種法權、亦由法律規定、初非可以任意支配、但其性質乃非預防的而爲懲戒的而已、關於此點、白氏曾引增廣版美法第四一○二節爲證該節規定、凡對上列各國（按卽四○八二節所稱之各國中國亦卽其一、）任何一國政府有意圖存推翻該政府而作亂或謀叛者、及預謀暗殺者、應爲大罪而處以極刑、又云、</p>
<p>若與任一交戰國私訂合同、而在公開戰爭中爲之服務之簡單行爲、則不得照此節論罪、就令如是、我政府亦無正當之權力對此予以制止、</p>
<p>此外之例證、如一九三二年中日在上海之對敵、而上海領有營業執照之引水公會之引水人、竟將日本兵艦帶入吳淞及上海港口、雖事前曾經海關當局代表中國加以禁止、亦屬無效、一方執有由海關用中國名義而發給之營業執照、一方則顯然濫用其特享之權利、竟對彼發給營業執照之政府之命令加以反抗、蓋彼輩利用治外法權之利益、乃忻然爲中國樹敵、如帶領日本兵艦自海道侵入上海、彼輩實託庇於照英國法律在香港註册之上海引水有限公司之引水船所懸之英國國旗、該公會之每、引水人、卽爲該公司之一股東、故在戰爭中、彼輩均有自由以任意蹂躪中國、</p>
<p>關於中國與世界各海權國所共同簽訂之公約、則有一九○七年所簽關於中立國之義務與權利之海牙公約、應予以注意、該約第十一條中規定、凡中立國對於交戰之戰艦、如駛入中立國口岸時、得允許該戰艦僱用中立國之領照引水、此條條文之構成及其應用、其命意乃在利用中立國引水人之職務、以保持其中立性、此外則有一九三三年所簽訂之海上生命安全公約、該約中對於引水人之職務、亦有所規定、故中國苟不能在本國各口岸對於引水人有全權之管理、則必不能與列强共同盡其公約之義務、</p>
<p>以上爲關於中國家之地位及其有施行引水管理新章之必要之簡單檢閱、至於上海領照引水人公會之地位、雖成爲法律問題、並實際影響於中國國家之主權、而對於在上海之外籍船務公司、並不能與以滿意、試觀一九三○年四月廿四日、上海外國總商會秘書之致上海港務長一函、述及關於該引水人等取費過高、點、該會已　有本埠三個運費評議會的一致答案云、該評議會會員對於現行之引水價目、均主張應予核减、並對該引水會表示、應予以澈底的改組、</p>
<p>至關於上海埠四十餘中國候補引水人之航海資格、則彼輩均爲現任之中國船長、彼輩航海保有與任何外籍船長相同之技巧與能力、試觀外國水險公司對於彼等所長之船同樣接受擔保、實爲一動聽之辯證、復次爲外籍引水之資歷、吾人可引某國領事之言、蓋彼之意見、當可視爲公平之表白、葛朗務君上海挪威總領、於彼所致上海首席領事克銀漢君、書有云、船務公司（外籍）曾經指明上海之引水人、係與航　中國沿海之</p>
<p>各船長同一資格</p>
<p>復次、則所有管理引水之新章、對於上海之外籍引水、並未禁止其繼續執業、故實無理由足以引起東方事務月刋之不平、而未來之上海安全問題之迫脅、則更屬無稽、然彼之故作此言、無非用以排斥中國人不令在本國領海任引水而已、此種不幸而特奇之現象殆可爲世界任何國家所絕無也、（完）</p>
<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>我們應該用什　麽態度來讀　學校功課</h3>
<p>前不多時，我們接得一位大學生的來信，他說我們指導讀書的對象，限於店員學徒這種態度是不甚當的、現在一班在學校裏讀書的人，也同樣感覺到讀書無所適從的苦處。他希望我們也和他們做學問上的討論。我們的目標，固是希望補助未受正式學校敎育而欲自學者，但對於他這種請求，自然也是不會拒絕的。最近又接到陳叔怡君的來信，他感覺到學校敎育的機械，功課的枯燥，不能滿足他的求知慾，因之，他想脫離學校，集約幾個同志到杭州租間房子，每日從浙江圖書館借書出來，自己閱讀、他想這樣得益一定是不少。由於他們兩位的提示，我們感覺到現在的學生，對於學校裏的功課，爲什麽會採取這種態度，這個問題確有提出來討論的必要。</p>
<p>一般學生對於學校功課不發生興趣，無疑的這是現在學校敎育缺憾太多。我們在這裏自然不能很詳細的指出，且就幾項最基本的拏來一談罷！</p>
<p>第一，今日學校的功課實在太機械化了。高級學校大致是背講義，自己從美國學來了，轉而向後人背誦那些講義，在美國也許是很有用的，但到了中國，有些簡直是廢話，這些未消化的糧食，學生是無興味接收的。現在一般高級學生都看不起學校的功課，不是無緣故的</p>
<p>第二，他們把功課當做一條鎖練，恨不得立刻解除這種束縛。這原因就是現在社會生活的紛擾，繁複，不能從敎師的講述，課本的說敎裏，得到一些解答。課本知識祗是一些僵化了的知識遺骸。在現在一切都是急速地在變動着，社會處在飛躍的狀態中的現階段，實踐要求每一個靑年去了解這流動變遷的過程中每一事件，要求了解社會向前發展的方向、要求處理實　生活的知識，這些，從課本中，先生的口裏都得不到的。因此，他們對於學校功課是完全絕望了。陳君所以要到杭州去自修，大概就是由於這個原因吧！</p>
<p>這種現象是普遍的，學校裏的功課有許多的確不値得我們學習，雖然這不是說學校功課的完全無用，但不能說不是今日敎育的破產。我們所迫切要學到的東西在功課中既然學習不到，學生另謀出路，從别的方面去攝取新的知識，並不能說是無理由。前幾天我到某學校裏去看一位親戚，看見他的功課表上一格中塡了兩個科目，西洋史與外國報，我很詫異的問他「你一點鐘學兩個科目嗎？學校中有外國報的課目嗎？」他的答語却妙極了：一上西洋史課讀外國報。」你以爲奇怪嗎？現在時事比背誦洋大人家裏的譜系更重要啊！你想專門熟記了希臘，埃及的興亡，中古羅馬的盛衰，這些堆砌的不足站在進化原則上叙述出來的史事能有多大益處呢？兩洋史我老早就自己讀過幾本極好的了。敎我的人他却還未讀過，你想氣不氣。我們學校裏上課，都是看我們自己的書籍，或者簡直不上課，睡在圖書館裏。一他又告訴我，一他們採用的課本，異常陳舊，内容也貧乏得利害，敎員的講述，更是七扯八拉，並没有補充了多少。至於社會科學科目，只大多是不切合事實，聽了令人氣死。一我們聽了這番話幾乎不敢加以反對。我當時祇能滑稽的唸一</p>
<p>句：「阿彌陀佛！」</p>
<p>但我們並不完全否認學校敎育，因爲自修要先有基礎能力纔行的，有許多基礎功課，仍是應當在學校裏學習，而且對於這些功課，更是絲毫疎忽不得的。不論自己將來是喜歡做那一種研究，或者做那一種事業，各種基本科學的知識是必不可少的。有許多人因喜歡讀課外書而把這些功課荒廢，這是極嚴重的錯誤，我們决計是不應再蹈他們的覆轍的。其他如習讀自然科學的人，對於學校的自然科學實騐，也不應忽略，决不可因爲多讀課外書而妨害了這些不是敷衍的正　。總之，我們對於學校功課凡是貧乏，不能適切我們的實生活，或不切事實的可以想方法另外由自修來補充是可以的，却不可因噎廢食的一切基礎知識，可以從學校習得的也一概擲之腦後了。</p>
<p>關於陳君離開學校的話，我們有以下的意見：假如你現在是在大學裏讀書，基礎知識已有根底，那你有這樣勇氣，我們是十分贊成的，若你還在中學讀書，那我們還希望你不要離開學校，基本科目還應用功學習，但那些在學校裏敎不好的東西，你却儘可自己去謀發展，不必勉强受功課的束縛的痛苦。</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這個詔書在京城裏是傳佈得非常快的；也有各人口頭通知的，也有各衙門用公事傳達的，也有在報紙上公告的；總之，不到幾小時以内，所有的官員，再没有不知道的了。至於京外的各省各府呢，那是用電報來傳達的。因此，但須皇太后隨意轉一個念頭，不消一天工夫，中國各地的官</p>
<p>吏，便一齊穿起皮衣來了。</p>
<p>待到西北風刮得更有勁的當兒，天氣自然是一些一些的更冷起來了，於是太后就繼續的頒佈伊的命令：由銀鼠而灰鼠，復由灰鼠而狐皮，再由狐皮而紫貂。但是紫貂這一種皮，却不是尋常的人可以隨便用的，在法令上早經「非書面」的規定，除頭二品大臣之外，餘官一概不得濫用；所以待到頭二品大臣穿貂皮的時候，他們便照舊穿狐皮，無論他們自己怎樣的有錢，也不敢大胆去買來穿的。</p>
<p>每一個官員和他的妻子，對於這些四季不同的衣服都是十</p>
<p>二分注意的。這種習慣算起來也己有好幾百年的歷史，大家還是很服從地奉行着。除了四季所規定的衣服之外，還有一種特殊情形。譬如說春天是到了，在某一天上，太后的懿旨是下去了，要如天氣果然已較和暖，皮衣當然是可以換下來了：但是萬一天氣並不比先前和暖，春裝穿着實嫌太冷，再穿皮衣，又恐違旨，那末就有一種介乎冬衣和春衣之間的「隔季」衣服出現了。舉一個例：假定某一年春天的天氣是特</p>
<p>别的冷，一直到春末夏初，還是冷得敎人脫不下棉衣或夾衣來，可是照法令上所規定着的辦法，這些日子已經要算是夏</p>
<p>季了。（五八）</p>
<h3>時裝與奇裝</h3>
<p>— 殺羽</p>
<p>在這天氣一天熱似天的時候，一班站在時代綫上的小姐太太，也漸漸地更換伊們的服裝。由臂部，腿部，以至頸部，胸部，背部，一部部裸露出來，以至一切的一切，在薄如蟬翼的紗旗衫裏，凹凹凸凸的露出了週身的曲綫，！醉人魂魄的曲綫！</p>
<p>衣服原係用來保護身體的，古書上說：「夏葛而冬裘。」然而到了現代，時髦的觀念，早打倒了氣候的權威。一班時代小姐，到了雪深三尺的冷天，除了一領皮大衣外，兀的週身尋不出一絲棉花；爲了俏，不怕凍得吱吱呌，何况到了裸體不覺寒冷的夏季，當然要回到自然，恢復樂園中夏娃！夏天的女人！的淸白本色！</p>
<p>雖然薰風吹到身上，還有些微寒意。然而海濱浴塲的舞女，早已穿了肉身裸出三分之二的浴衣，在幽靜的電燈光下，在柔媚音樂聲裏，期待着我們布爾喬亞的少爺們。我們甜姐兒，也扣着僅僅遮着一二部分的舞裝，站在雜誌封面上，迷迷地發着甜笑。是的公園裏面，人行道上，已早發現穿了洞兒肉體的薄紗衣衫的女郎，雖然頑固的人瞧了會得起着寒栗。</p>
<p>據說蔣委員長爲厲行新生活運動，已决意取締婦女們的奇裝異服。然而這種肉體隱約的服裝，是來自歐美一九二四年是時髦的新裝，是不是要取締，和能不能取締，却還是另一問題，須待事實證明！</p>
<h3>驢與花</h3>
<p>— 季誠性</p>
<p>從前有過這樣一個故事。</p>
<p>有一個女人的左眼是瞎了的；但其餘部分仍不失其美人身份。同時有一個美男子，但他的右脚是跛了的。他倆都有缺陷美，假使有人介紹，互相結合，似乎是可能的。</p>
<p>他倆都想求得一個十全的活美人，一天，這女人在樓上的窗下坐着，伊在等候探婚的另人到來，右手揑着一束花，遮去了左眼。缺陷既被花遮了，同時花與女人相映，豈不是成爲史美麗了嗎？於是伊得意地微笑着。</p>
<p>那個從窗外經過的騎在驢上的男人，探到這樣一個活美人，自然滿面春風地策馬回家，不久卽托媒人上女家說媒。女的聽到來說媒的，正是那天騎在驢上的美男子，也非常快活。老實說，從那時起，彼此都有對方的好印象。</p>
<p>到了結婚那天，男的發見女的缺了左眼，女的發見男的跛了右脚。</p>
<p>「怎麽你的左眼是瞎的！」男的驚愕地望着女人。</p>
<p>「怎麽你的右脚是跛了的！」女的也驚愕地望着男子。</p>
<p>他倆一致承認，這内幕全是驢與花在作祟，以後男的瞧見花，就想起了瞎一眼的妻子；女的瞧見驢，就想起了跛一脚的丈夫。</p>
<p>驢與花竟這樣的惡作劇！</p>
<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 朱仲孫</p>

<p>某翁尾隨，摩登女郎，挑以輕薄語，婦回眸報曰：「請與令郎商議，渠苟允，則儂敢不從命。」</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>東北四連長第三十回　目送哀鴻埋頭守國土　蟬穿勁臂灑血染孤城</p>
<p>弟們看到連長這樣出力，當然，不便站在一邊不動手，也跟着努力起來。自强足足挖有一小時之久，才放下鋤子，將手一伸道：諸位弟兄等着，聽我說話罷。大家聽了，就各自放下工作，伸直了腰，站着聽自强的話。自强道：弟兄們，你别瞧着我這鋤頭，隨便向下放了去，你可知道我們這一鋤子挖起來，那怕是四兩土，都是祖宗給我們留下來的。我們要掙着硬氣，說是我們祖宗的後代，就得保守着這一塊土，不能讓别人搶了去。我們是軍人，國家給飯我們吃，給衣服我們穿，那是爲了什麽，就是爲了要我們替祖宗守土地啦。你們聽見說閒書的没有？薛仁貴征東，做到大元帥，同朝來封到平遼王，他可是當火頭軍的出身啦。俗言說得好，將相本無種，男兒當自强。什麽大事，不是入幹的。你别說自己是個當大兵的没有什麽出息，古來做大事的，誰不是從下面爬起來。這是往好處說。再往癩處說罷。要是咱們不能守住國土，讓敵人給佔去了。那就咱們的家，是敵人的家，咱們的兒女，咱們的祖墳，就是咱們身上空的衣服，說不定都會給敵人覇佔了去。一個人到了那個時候，還有什麽意思。你們還没有聽見說呢，小鬼可厲害的很。你要是亡了國了，他可以把咱們中國人，當活動板凳。怎麽呌活動板凳呢。就是呌咱們跟着在他身後走，假使他走乏了，就讓咱們蹲了下來，他好坐在咱們肩膀上。一個人到了那種地步，也不過牛馬罷啦。（四○九）</p>

<h3>麥特赫司　脫講話</h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>公共租界一路二路電車，沿着靜安寺路向西駛行，中途折入了愛文義路之後，在過了卡德路站口，還没到戈登路站口，這中間停下來的地方，斜對面有那租界惟一的工部局女子中學的　呌做麥特赫司脫路。這一條麥特赫司脫路，名字是公共租界馬路中頂長的了，可是從路的本身的長度上說起來，却只是許多短路裏面的一條。南面的一端雖說從威海衛路起，但一直到靜安寺路那一段，與其說是馬路，無寗說是弄堂的好，所以應該說從靜安寺路起，那麽曲了兩曲，向北穿過愛文義路，新閘路和武定路，一到康腦脫路便告了終結，因爲對面的那條是以曲折著名的麥根路了。</p>
<p>這是以麥特赫司脫作爲名字的馬路。</p>
<p>如果我們再從街頭跑回書齋，翻翻上海學校的名字，那麽便可發現一所呌麥倫中學的。這麥倫中學是英國倫敦敎會在民國紀元前二十一年創辦的，初名華英書院，設在山東路麥家圈。紀元前十二年，學校遷到了兆豐路現在的地址，校名也便改爲麥倫書院。直到民國十七年，纔遵照私立學校規程，把意義欠明的書院兩字，改爲兩級中學。可是敎會學校的名字是要看它原來的外國文的，而所謂麥倫中學者，英文却止是「麥特赫司脫學院」。</p>
<p>喝！又是個以麥特赫司脫作爲名字的學校。</p>
<p>卽使曉得麥特赫司脫是人名吧，我們難道不想再問問究竟是怎樣的人呢？</p>
<p>然而說起了麥特赫司脫，却不免有纒夾的危險。原來上海的外國名人，有父子兩個，姓氏果然都是麥特赫司脫（Medhiurot），而且名字的</p>
<p>縮寫也是同樣的Ｗ·Ｈ·這兩個字母。雖然因爲父親是個敎士，神學博士，西文書中說起他的時候，可以加上「多看透」（Doctor)這個頭銜，以與其未曾「多看透」的令郎相别，可是還儘多把老子的頭銜加到兒子身上去，或者把老子去掉頭銜變成了兒子的。免得纒夾，還是看他們的中文姓名吧。父親呌麥都恩，把他原姓中的Ｈ這個字母不讀出來，譯音而成。兒子呌麥華佗，麥當然是譯他原姓的第一個音，華佗則是他的敎名（Christian　Name)Walter的音譯。</p>
<p>這父子兩個英國人，都是著名的「中國通」。父親麥都恩是傳佈上帝福音的基督敎士。上海開埠之後，他便在上海四週，作宗敎的活動。道光二十八年（一八四八）靑浦不是發生過糧船水手與英國敎士衝突的事情，結果因爲駐滬英國領事阿利國的老虎外交，非但交出「肇事人」和賠償敎士損失，而且蘇松太道王紹復亦因而調任他處的麽？那三個敎士，麥都恩使是裏面的一個。咸豐四年一八五四）外人組織工部局，麥都恩便是工部局第一屆董事之一；這簡直是做了官了，不過不拿薪俸而已。</p>
<p>兒子麥華佗則不僅做官，而且又拿薪俸的。他於道光二十三年九月十七日（一八四三年十一月八日）跟了英國駐滬第一任領事巴爾福同夾上海，以中國通的資格充任領署翻譯。咸豐同治之交，他做了駐滬領事。光緒初，又回任了一次。</p>
<p>所以爲澈底正名起見，實在應該把紀念又親的麥特赫司脫學院改爲麥都恩中學，把紀念兒子的馬路呌做麥華佗路的。你說該不該啦？</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>關於文言文</h3>
<p>— 徐𢡟庸</p>
<p>我的一個朋友，在上海一個女校當敎員，敎的是高中三年級的國文，有一晚，他拿了一疊學生的作文簿來，說是因爲太忙，要我幫他改一下。</p>
<p>高中三年級的女生，在上海，至少已是十七八歲的摩登女郎，有的定該是寫情書的聖手了。我懷着一種近於好奇的必情，很高興地接過三十多本簿子，想看看這些卷子的主人們的手筆。在揭開封面以前，我幻想着，裏面有的是和她們的身段一般玲瓏的思想，和她們的裝束一般豓麗的詞藻：摩登女郎的文章一定是富於淸新的現代味的。</p>
<p>然而，眞所謂「不看猶可」，看完了三十歲本簿子之後，我是感到異常的「幻滅」了。</p>
<p>三十多個高中三年級的女生的文章没有一篇的造句是通達的，没有一篇的立意是妥當的。字數呢，最長的還不滿五百，雖然是這樣短的文章，改起來却異常費力，有幾篇簡直只配完全塗掉。</p>
<p>這是怎麽一回事呢？我馬上就明白了，原來是敎學文言文的結果。我翻遍三十本簿子，裏面的每篇都是用不通的文言寫的。我不禁要替這三十多個摩登女郎呼寃。然而我又知道現在在學校中同樣地受着文言文的毒害的學生，决不止這三十多個。文言文這僵屍，已「重來」到許多學校，大肆活動了。和這同時，有許多在雜誌報章上撰文的作家，也有意或無意地傾向文言文，或全以文方文撰稿，或在白話文中夾雜許多文言的句子去。</p>
<p>以上這兩種事實，不是偶然發生的，研究起來二者的原因其實是一個，在於社會的現狀。現在有一個反對文言文的運動正在開始了。但反對者的論證，若徒從文言白話本身的優劣上出發，那是必至成爲無濟於事的常談的。反對的第一步，必須指出目前事實的社會的原因。在這裏，我不能將那原因詳細地指陳。因爲在上面談的是女學生，我就將女人的纏足來作個比喻。纏足的起源，大概可有兩說：一說是婦女成爲奴隸之後，男子卽用種種方法加以拘束，纏足卽拘束的手段之一。自從解放的口號喊出之後，中國的女子確有許多留了天足，但因留了天足究竟太自由了，所心人們又給她們穿上高跟皮鞋，使她們走路時仍然一步一拐，和纏了足一樣。</p>
<p>第二說，則如Plekanov在藝術論中所云，是富裕的妖姬們，因爲無勞動之必要，不把時間看重，所以特地把自己的步行拘束起來，當做是媚惑的樣子，而和貧窮的因而從事勞動的女子們的走相故意表示相反。這是所謂「對立的根源」說。</p>
<p>這兩說都是合於事實的，但深究起來，原因也只是一個。就是某一時代的社會狀態使然。在那狀態中的社會的支配者，爲限制被支配者的起見，不但加以拘束，且將那拘束的狀態故意認爲高貴美麗而使人自願地去就範。</p>
<p>今日的學校之所以敎學文言文，就是拘束學生的思想的自由活動，這是很容易奏效的。至於有些作家，則因身處富裕悠閑的階級，做的是吟風弄月的文章，他們的生活决定他們的作品的題材，他們的作品的題材，决定他們的作品的形式，所以他們愛寫文言文。然而也有一類，則自知思想凌厲，用白話直抒胸臆，易致麻煩，所以帮意用文言作文，使他的思想披上一件不甚顯明的外衣免得十分惹眼。爲什麽許多學校要拘束學生的思想呢？爲什麽吟風弄月的作家又被重視的呢？爲什麽有的作家會這樣怕事的呢？我以爲這其間必有共通的社會的原因，但是我並不能詳細地明白地指出。誰能够指出呢？指出了原因，使大衆認識，反對文言文的運動這纔不至落空。</p>
<p>看敎育部所訂的課程標凖，專重文言文是不許的。那些違反敎育部的法令的學校，是要受處分的，這不待我來說。我只希望許多的作家，若非不得已，不要有意地再用文言撰稿，因爲這是無意地替某種不良的傾向推波助瀾。否則未來的靑年的頭腦，都將成爲冬烘，和有人推測高跟鞋流行的結果，將來全國女人的脚趾都和小腿成一直綫一樣。</p>
<h3>流言</h3>
<p>— 止</p>
<p>每當時局一混亂，荒謬的理論便層出不窮。糊塗人是時常怕天要掉下來的，老百姓的心理更虚弱，於是有作用者因此造謠，陰謀家藉此煽動，於是譁然相告，於是駭然而走，於是岌岌不可終日，於是乎時局便無法收拾。</p>
<p>正大光明的人是少的，雖然這正是社會的中堅。正大光明的理論是少影響的，有力量的正是無稽之談。歐戰時代，輿論算是還比較有人看了，那時民氣還正開通，但無論怎樣一時國人不明白「參戰」的道理，及德國應該被打的理由。其時科學好像萬能，於是有陰謀家製造流言，德國人正用死屍熬油，熬了油做什麽呢？做肥皂！</p>
<p>在西洋人眼裏中國的家族制度和祖先崇拜，是非常可驚的，這麽一宣佈之後，德國人在敝國人腦筋裏，便皆好像吃人的魔鬼了，當然應該有共同聲討的義務。遙遙遠遠在歐洲苦鬥的德國民族，便於不知不覺中蒙了不白之寃。</p>
<p>無如科學一直進步到今朝，還未曾有過死屍作肥皂的先例，歐戰終了，漸漸才發覺歷史上這麽一段奇寃。但已經生過效用了，解釋也無意義了。</p>
<p>時至今日，世界的風雲又正緊張，於是國際的陰謀家流言家又如雲而起，利用人心惶駭之際，製造出似乎可靠消息，惟利是圖，而且也層出不窮，一批無效，更來一批，愈出愈奇，愈來愈巧，寃翻了一時代人民的心理。</p>
<p>卽着近事，又有什麽國的預言家來華了，專講世界大勢，但也爲人論相，說吉凶。而敝國的報紙，不惜作義務宣傳，因爲那預言家說中國在世界戰爭中必勝。那兒來的招搖撞騙的流氓呢？社會上有羣起而攻之的中堅份子的輿論麽？</p>
<p>嗚呼！「如彼泉流，無淪胥以敗」。社會上正鬧某處靈仙降乩，某處又發現狐妖，這就呌作没有法子。</p>
<h3>箇舊廠（上）　丨丨鑛山通訊之一丨丨</h3>

<p>一邊是老陰山淫蕩的裸露着，一邊是老陽山不知羞恥的挺着。魚鱗似的千萬間房子，便建築在這天然「陰」「陽」之下在過去，此地是非常混亂的，丨丨</p>
<p>頭上裹着兩丈多長的繞子，領褂上繫着一二十個銀毫製的鈕扣，褲脚捲到膝頭上，手指常扳着一觸卽發的槍機，像煞有介事，出現在街道上的，多是這類英雄！</p>
<p>搕詐，欺騙，有時，扔下頭來孤注一擲，是他們的英雄本色。</p>
<p>還有穿着齷齪的泥巴衣裳，走在街道上，望着不過是一個從廠上下來的砂丁，可是，當他遇着那類獨身的英雄時，便會颶的一聲，冷不防將藏在身上的利刀㧞出，連戳幾下，搶着槍走了。</p>
<p>因此，晚上是没有人敢出門來，有錢的老板常是白天穿着一件粗布短衣，戴着瓜皮小帽，很寒酸的走在街道上。但也有悠閒的拿着象牙烟管，披着外套，前後左右擁着護衛的，那是没有人敢惹喲！</p>
<p>現在是不同以前了。街上愈見繁華，帝國主義的洋貨眩目耀眼的充斥滿每個商店裏。奢糜的菜館常是這末爲我們的老板們熱鬧着。</p>
<p>矗立在老陰山脚的錫務公司，高聳的烟囱口日夜不息的冒着黑烟，這是此地唯一的近代新式工業組織，除了這而外，便都是一些沿用舊法的小組織了。　　箇舊雖是產錫之地，但採鑛的却在離此三四十里的廠上。廠是很廣大的，蘊藏着極富的錫鑛，分爲四十八廠，每廠都是有着許多開鑛的。······</p>
<p>到廠上去的路，是崎嶇的山道，走在路上，一眼望出去，盡是光秃的鑛山，一棵綠得可愛的樹也不見！回頭一看：箇舊是在得這麽低低的。</p>
<p>那時，我跟着一個「走水」的熟人，挑着担子，一早便上廠去，怒號的罡風，呼呼的迎面撲來，使人連氣也喘不過來。冒着寒冷，走了這末一早才到廠上。丨丨使我一見便驚異的，是滿身呢土糊住的砂丁，很忙碌的在挖着，挑着。有的頭上挿着一盞煤氣燈，耳上夾着一根括汗片，一個蔴布褡褳掛在肩膀上，彎着腰，便如老鼠一般的鑽到鑛洞裏去。鑛洞是那樣黑得可怕，洞口剛剛能容一個人進去，頂上「使着廂」丨丨用一根根短小的栗木撑持着，洞深的有十多里，淺的亦有四五里。裏面有着許多不容易爬過的地方，有的，在出洞來時，非將滿裝着鑛砂的褡褳從肩膀上取下，先推過去，然後再如蛇一樣的匍匐着爬過去不可。有的，在匍匐着走的時候，俟頭過了關口，這得這麽翻一個身，慢慢的爬過去丨丨。這呌做「長蟲脫殻，老鷹翻身」。可是，還有危險的「牢塘」「吊井」哩。這些深不可測的陷阱，都是前人探鑛挖了荒廢的，若一不經心跌進去，我的媽天，活條條的一條性命，便是這樣嗚呼了！</p>

<p>駡你一聲「不要臉」，你必定感覺到非常難過，反過來說，讚你一句「多麽講究面子」，飄飄欲仙的輕鬆快感也許會游蕩在你心頭。</p>
<p>因此，爲着面子，人們算多了一件大事。</p>
<p>但是，雖然「面子」被當作一件大事，牠是按照各自所屬的階層而有等級的。縱使你有本領越級的向上爬，不見得就絕對不遭同級儕的嘲笑，向下跌呢，分明你是遭遇着什麽意外，照例人們是要你維持「面子」的。起碼他們將假作慈悲相，極力爲你多方張羅。說不定他們自己則在暗中揩些油水。像婚喪事體更是好例。本人略有金錢的固然想多花一筆錢，藉以博取人們的讚賞；自身業已一窮如洗的呢，爲着「面子」咬着牙根張羅起來，或由於自願，或由於親朋的主意，眞也不算少數。</p>
<p>自然，如上所述，「面子」講究到若何程度，主要的决定條件是在各人的所屬階層，所謂經濟背景。增減可以成爲正比例。所以在各階層中說來，究其講究「面子」的多寡程度，官僚，政客，富翁一定佔在優勢。似乎「衣食足禮義興」正是好話。不過，究其誠心與否，那又不見得官僚，政客，富翁會佔優勢。反比例的，他們爲的只是「交際」，是企圖換取或維持自己的地位，說不上有什麽誠心哩！</p>
<p>有些人，窮到不能有什麽禮物來「禮尙往來」，但是，假如他和你講交情，他是誠心誠意的。可是，你要是呌他講究應酬上的所謂「面子」，没有錢才正是他們的難題呵！</p>
<h3>咒唸</h3>
<p>— 徐訐</p>
<p>就因爲我去的時候稍晚，所有的人們已經獸散，大殿上只賸黃土的泥壇，地下有黃紙糊過的木板。一個個搬夫將一根根木條搬，他們一面揩着汗，一面長歎，那一根木頭不有黃色的聖紙粘？爲什麽他們的重量一點没有减！被超度的鬼們呌得更慘，</p>
<p>被降福的人們仍將乾草當做飯，只有附近的犬吠帶着七分懶，算是學會了這塲熱鬧的咒唸。一九三四，五，二三。</p>
<h3>桂英爸（一）</h3>
<p>— 嘩子</p>
<p>照這地方的例，對於一個有子女的男子，倘非有行輩可排的親戚，則常在其人的子或女的名字下加一個「爸」字，以相稱呼。這本是「ＸＸ的爸」的簡稱．但這「爸」字的聲音，在此得唸作Pan。他的女兒的名字是桂英，所以人們呌他「桂英Pan」。</p>
<p>所謂這地方，是我的妻娘家所在的Ｗ縣。Ｗ縣是浙東一個富庶的小縣，橘和米這兩種物產，給它造成繁榮的市面，但是它的一條西街，却十分冷落慘澹。這街的左右兩旁，都是些破奮的房子，可知這一帶並無有錢的人家。倘不是逢三逢九的日子，街上的行人，比徬徨覓食的野狗只多了一兩倍。每逢三九，則大不同了，西門外八十里内的鄉人，都到城中來趕市集。自早晨五六點鐘起，人和担子便潮水似的湧進西門，流過西街，一直衝到尾閭的大街。在九點至十二點鐘之間，若非氣力大能够擠的人，就不必想到街路上去走，在那里簡直尋不出容得一個人的空隙。到了十二點鐘左右，鄉人們的担子多半空了，褡褳裏已裝着和豫算差不多的銀角和銅元，家近的和節儉的就買了所要買的東西先回去。這　一大批，則分頭找着慣熟的小酒店，化十幾個銅元喝一兩碗酒，享樂一下子。</p>
<p>我的岳母家設在西門頭的一爿小酒店，便是做這班主顧在這些日子内的生意的。一到這些日子，那唯一的店員，我的岳母的長孫阿仁，就有應接不暇之勢，於是我的岳母也要親自出馬，　酒燙酒，忙個不了。有的時候，甚至我的妻和妻的姊姊，也得下樓帮一會忙。</p>
<p>岳母將家宅分給兒媳們住，自己和兩個女兒住在酒店的樓上。當我和她的最幼的女兒結婚之後，我也曾在這樓上經過一箇多月。住在這上面是很寂寞的，岳母聽不懂我的口音，根本不能交談，除了妻和妻的姊姊以外，没有第三個談話的對乎。樓下管店的阿仁，市日是太忙，閒日没有生意，老是在櫃台上仰躺着看連環圖畫。他卽使空着，同我也没有什麽可談。街上，當冷淸的時候，没有可看的事物，在店門口站不到五分鐘，就會厭倦。熱鬧的日子又太鬧，尤其是十多個鄉下人醉後高興像要擾事的狀態，使我恐懼。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>斥預言</h3>
<p>— 白榕</p>
<p>前兩天在大陸報以及幾個中文報紙上看到一件非常有趣的消息，就是某外國女預言家麗拉女士關於時局的種種預言，同時大陸報還把她那雙犀利的眼光拍照印在報上，可見人們對此事的重視了，可是對於此事，我們究竟不敢十分相信，現在把我的感想分述於下。</p>
<p>中國人的腦筋，好像一直就没經過科學的洗禮，對於一切事物，都存着一種似是而非的汛靈論的見解，新文化運動已經有數十年的歷史了，而一般人的文化水凖，却還没突過孔德所說的神權時期的最初階段，卽在較進步的知識階級也不能免，這不能不說是一件怪事。一方面高喊着科學救國，一方面邪說橫行，在民衆的思想上投以劇烈的毒素，卽如最近風行一時的科學碟乩就是這種假借科學之名愚弄民衆的明證。而最近，這原始女巫式的「預言家」也隨着帝國主義的槍砲商品一同侵入我們的生活中來了。</p>
<p>我們不說她預言之是否靈騐，先看看預言這種東西能否成立？牠的依據究是什麽？據我們愚昧的見解，預言這種東西是根本不能成立的，所謂能知過去未來這一類掩耳盜鈴的話的，　是在作着巫祝式的痴人說夢的工作。我們只相信歷史，歷史的進展與社會的變革自有其必然的規律。然而這是科學的，有因果律的，而非信口雌黃的胡說。同麗拉女士一樣，我們也知道日俄終必出於一戰，然而形成我們這種觀念的並非玄妙的推測，而是國際政治經濟之交綜作用以做成的鐵樣的事實。我們也相信中國之必將復興，然而這復興也不是什麽天意，而是物質條件所决定所促成。不脚踏實地去理解事實，而搖頭擺腦地說冥冥中的天理，這是一種不可補救的愚妄，相信這愚妄而爲定命論所拘囿，這是一種幼稚不堪的滑稽與荒唐！</p>
<p>在這裏，我願向同胞進一言。外國輸入我國的東西並不算少，其中雖有蒸汽機與無綫電，可是也有洋酒與嗎啡，外國的東西並不全是可崇拜的。作爲次殖民地的文化較低落的我國民衆，在與舶來品對面而受其影響的時候，是應當以批判的選擇的態度接受下來的。我們要在思想上佈好防禦綫，使一切含有毒素的菌物不會侵襲到我們生活中來，影響了我們的健康。年來美國肉感色情影片之流行，該給我們無數純潔靑年留下多麽可驚的影響！只要冷靜地思考一下時，就該明白外國東西不盡是可靠的吧？</p>
<p>照目前情形觀察，麗拉女士的預言，是很可能的使我們蒙其影響的。在這裏，中國人之缺乏科學觀念與盲目崇拜外人的心理雖可促成此種謬說的流行。但最主要的還是我們經濟生活所决定。列强的壓迫，無盡的内亂，連年的疾疫，使我們生出孤立無援的感情來。在爲生存鬥爭的過程中，孤立無援的人們，必然地要把眼光移向上天，希望神祇的救濟，而因此便胚胎出我們民族的宗敎性。因爲長久處於災荒動亂之中，定命論思想與果報觀念便在民衆思想上得到深刻的盤踞勢力。試看年來的推背圖，科學碟乩，那一樣不是在最危難最杌隉的時機產生出來的？</p>
<p>預言是靠不住的，我希望大家以科學爲血淸注射劑，把我們血管中的迷信毒素掃滌一淸，因爲只有這纔能把我們由愚妄中拯救出來！</p>
<h3>妻子的丈夫</h3>
<p>— 穆琳</p>
<p>從轉門中送出兩個一高一矮的漢子，每天在五點鐘的時候。一路談着向他們的家中走去，無論風雪陰晴，他們是被生活的重擔壓迫着，藉着兩條行路的腿節省幾文車費。</p>
<p>這時候，五點鐘，一高一矮的漢子從轉門中送出來了，照例是各自低着頭走路，閉上了眼睛也可以摸回家去的路</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>：然而不然，矮的一個向高的點了點頭，同時不知說了句什麽話，獨自向電車站那邊走去了，這是稀有的事，他的妻子在出門的時候不使他多帶一包仙女牌價値以上的一枚銅元。他走近了電車站，也似乎頓悟自己袋中是没有零錢，低頭沉思了一下，昻然地坐上黃包車走了，這自然是更稀有的事，估量他每天行路的時間，車費一定在三包仙女牌價格之上。</p>
<p>他推進了後門，一個中年婦人在自來水旁洗衣服，是他的妻子。照例他們是不交一語的，一個自顧工作，一個自顧跑上樓去。然而不然，妻子瞧見了丈夫歸來，忙拭乾了手跟着他上樓。進了臥房丨丨是那末小的一間亭子間，男的没有坐定，妻子露着稀有的笑臉開了：「加幾塊錢？」</p>
<p>丈夫的舉止也稀有的奇突，拉了妻子的雙手並坐到床沿上，這種熱情的表示，從他們結婚後遷到上海來就没有過的事，今天眞是個稀有的日了，他輕輕拍着她的手背那樣溫柔的反問：</p>
<p>「這猜？」</p>
<p>妻子側了頭，眼睛注視着對方，似乎顯出稀有的嬌態說：</p>
<p>「六塊？不，」她忙自己改正「四塊罷？」</p>
<p>「哈，都不是！」丈夫說了，對方彷彿失望似的歛了笑容；但是丈夫接着說了：「八塊啊！」伸出右手來在妻子的面前幌了幌。</p>
<p>妻子拍着手從床沿跳起來「你這樣辛苦　老關倒底知道的，所惟我老呌你不要偷懶；再過三年，照這樣子加上去，也好接我的媽出來住了。」說完了平平的攤着手掌。</p>
<p>丈夫從内衣袋裏掏出鈔票角子來，一五，一十，······二十八元四角都放到妻子的手掌上，然後舒了一口氣躺到床上去休息。</p>
<p>「噲，還有兩毛錢呢？」</p>
<p>丈夫微微昻起頭「坐黃包車回來的」。</p>
<p>妻子旋過頭去瞧瞧壁上的時計，這時候還較平時早十分鐘，一面可惜兩毛錢化得太浪費，一而也不願意十分責問他的丈夫，自語着：「三天的的香烟錢哩！」說着把鈔票角子藏到她的箱子裏去。</p>
<p>「眞的，今天事情太忙，香烟早抽完了，替我去買一包罷！」頓了頓，像不好意思似的「買一包美麗牌罷。」</p>
<p>字音一個個低下去，但是早給妻子聽淸楚了「什麽？誰喚你坐黃包車的，不是吃美麗牌也有兩包？就是仙女牌抽抽罷。」</p>
<p>丈夫微笑着，私忖「就是不坐黃包車也不能抽美麗牌的，女人永遠有女人的算計，做男子的永遠是妻子的丈夫。」　　吃過夜飯，他抽着烟對妻子說：「明年再加八塊錢可以抽美麗牌了。」</p>
<p>「到明年再說罷！」雖是笑着說，但是丈夫早知道明年的香烟問題已提前在這裏决定了。</p>
<p>「男子永遠是妻子的丈夫！」從烟圈中他望着妻子的臉。</p>
<h3>畢業和畢命</h3>
<p>— 何覺夫</p>
<p>在同學間，紛紛謠傳着老李自殺的消息，昨天是被證實了。</p>
<p>李李，是個愛說笑，愛胡鬧的靑年：性情是那麽的溫和，舉止是那麽的靈活。像他這樣一個看來是很樂天的人，竟也會自殺，起初我委實不大相信；但，他留給他父親的遺書和遺像，在拍紙簿上寫着不少首與世辭别的小詩，是淸淸楚楚地擺在我的眼前；前晚在新夜報上，登載着他在吳淞海自殺，屍體已被當地農民撈起的消息，又是同學們誰個都看到的。這還敢懷疑是誰個撤謊嗎？</p>
<h3>懐鄉小唱</h3>
<p>— 秋月</p>
<p>夜色是這樣的靜寂荒凉，晶瑩皎月放出她微弱的餘光，我獨自坐在槐樹蔭下，翹望着悠悠的碧天，　Ｘ　·　　Ｘ　　·　　Ｘ</p>
<p>㗒！往事如烟，不堪回首憶當年！啊！月兒喲！請把妳的淸輝，照到我的心田上吧，帶我到，我那懷念着的故鄉。我的故鄉喲，啊！我時時遙望着妳而惆悵！</p>
<p>Ｘ　·　Ｘ　　·　Ｘ</p>
<p>我離了家鄉，已有三年，不知那兒的風光，可和昔年一樣？丨丨那兒的烟樹，那兒的白雲縹渺的湖山。啊啊！還有那，嫩苗蒼綠的，風來時，陣陣成波的稻。··</p>
<p>Ｘ　　·　　Ｘ　　·　Ｘ</p>
<p>我想歸去，我想歸去！啊！我别後三年的故鄉！啊！我的故鄉喲！我如今，只有遙望着妳而惆悵！</p>
<p>本來，一個人的自殺，在這年頭，是算不得什麽一回事的；但，爲了考不畢業而尋短見，我總有些悵然！</p>
<p>「咳！老李也委實太懦弱了！」他的死，我苦找不到解釋，昨晚在老林之前，我就這樣的喟歎着。丨丨因老林與他是個比較親密的一個。</p>
<p>『這可也不怪得他懦弱，他所受的激刺，也委實太多了：他是在『一二八』那學期畢業的，恰就逢着戰事爆發，業畢不成；去年，他和幾個朋友，一同假造文憑，考進ＸＸ學的第二年級，剛讀滿一個學期，人家皆靑雲直上，單就他被學校查出，立卽開除學籍；今年，他轉回來讀高三第二學期，自以爲總可一帆風順了，誰想又碰着這釘子呢？並且，他是讀文科的，高等的自然科學，往前在學校是未曾學過，而這次恰就因了高等物理和解析幾何這二科不及格，致畢不得業，那呌他不氣憤？本來，一張文憑拿不到手，在我們看來，原是不多大要緊的；但，他讀書是那麽的用功，聲譽一向又很好，現在竟連在校畢業也畢不成，是受不了父母的辱駡，人家的奚落和譏嘲的呀！』老林很憤慨地這樣駁答我的話。</p>
<p>雖經老林這麽詳細地對我述說，我雖也曉得一個人的自殺，决不能像我那麽簡單地以『個性的懦弱』這一句話去解釋的；但，除能對死者挖苦幾句外，誰又敢責備那一個，歸咎那一種制度呢！</p>
<p>畢業會考的期間，尙没有到；但，一條年紀靑靑的生命，就此完結了！</p>
<p>去年，看見報載南開大學劉維翰君，因考不畢業，而跳樓自殺的消息，我不覺爲之不快許久；不圖今年我的同學老李，竟又罹着此禍，那呌我不爲之太息？幸好，見聞不廣的我，所知道的，也只是劉君與我的同學老李而已！</p>
<h3>猪仔與沙丁　丨南洋印象的回憶丨</h3>
<p>— 楓</p>
<p>這裏所說的猪仁，并不是我們日常所看見被豢養在栅欄裏面的小猪獧，而是在南洋羣島的「山巴」内做苦工的中國人；所請沙丁，也絕不是被作爲食料的沙丁魚，而是一種無形中已出賣了生命的鑛工；總之，這裏所說的猪仁與沙丁，原是在生活的鞭策下被趕到死綫上去的人們呀！</p>
<p>若干年前的南洋島，在我們中國人的眼中，簡直是一座金山，因爲那個時期確有不少的人空着手到南洋去，回來却帶着巨萬的資財。可是，時至今日，寄居南洋羣島的中國人，在雙重壓迫底下，因商業失敗而宣告破產。早日擁有巨資的財主，一旦已成爲破落户，而一班依靠財主們過活的人，至此更不堪設想！於是乎，猪仔的人類，由茲而生。</p>
<p>因爲在都市没法立足的中國工人，被擠到「山巴」内去做各種的苦工的，便是猪仔。他們每天得做十小時以上的工作，而得得的代價，每日最多不過一塊洋錢，還要經受工頭的剝削呢。且因氣候燥熱，生活苦，「山巴」内的山風瘴氣，毒蛇猛獸的侵害，因而致死者，（所謂死猪仔）日有所聞。實在的，被擠到山巴内去的猪仔，卽使有天大的本領，也無返祖國的希望。好像是命運决定了：一生是猪仔，死而後已！</p>
<p>同樣的，在國内有許多從破產了的農村裏逃出來的，和被生活的巨石壓得透不過氣來的人們，夢想着挖鑛可以發財，而把健壯的身軀，送進鑛山裏面，活活地被埋葬了，就好像罐頭裏的沙丁魚一樣。</p>
<p>一批批的沙丁，從各處被帶到鑛山裏面來，發財的美夢，終給苦囚一般的生活，打得粉碎了！他們在簽押了十年或十五年的工作合同之後，每天便得給公司做十小時以上的工作，在那瘴氣瀰漫着的鑛山裏面。在那暗無天日的地獄裏，橫受凌虐欺榨。據說這鑛裏是活着進來，死了也出不去的啊！</p>
<p>在鑛山裏的沙丁，有如牢獄裏的囚人，祇有號頭，没有姓名。他們在的是和監獄一樣的爐房，他們的生活是：天剛剛發亮，就得起身，由鑛警在門外呌一聲，全房間的人就魚實地走了出來，每個人穿着同樣的粗麻布衣，戴的粗麻布帽，掮着麻袋，脚下釘子脚鐐，每一個房間的沙丁排成一行列，由照應這房間的幾個武裝鑛警押送着，走過濃霧瀰漫的山路，攅進鑛洞裏去，一直到傍晚時分，才拖着疲勞的身軀，被押回爐房來。這樣的把生命斷送了！</p>

<h3>賣粽婦</h3>
<p>— 珍妮</p>
<p>老是下雨天，街上是泥濘的，從早上起，她便一手挽着木桶，一手挽着竹籃，在泥水裏走着，她是一個賣粽婦！</p>
<p>在每年的五月黃梅季節裏，她照例的從早上起就在街上喊着：『阿要粽子？』</p>
<p>雖然她也恨着這老是下雨的季節，但是爲着給生活所厭逼，恨也只好恨在肚裏，有時她在臉上浮着一層怒色，這怒色却亦没有誰會同情她的。</p>
<p>就說舊年吧！她雖然也從早上起就在街上喊着『』阿要粽子？假使是下着大雨，或是冒着風，覺得不舒適，不高興的話，就不一定要老早就爬起挽着木桶走到街上去喊賣粽子，因爲舊年她的兒子在廠裏有工作做，而且她的男人每天還擺一個小攤兒在街角上，或是弄堂口，一天多少總是收些進來，全家子是很舒適的和平的把歲月度過去了。</p>
<p>從今年起情形就變了，男人在正月裏得病就死了，兒子也就在這當兒給廠裏减除工人减除掉了，現在還是浮閒在家裏，事實在這苦痛的環境裏，五月的黃梅季節裏，泥濘的雨天裏，她無論怎樣都不能不高興挽着木桶在淸早就到街上去喊着：『阿要粽子』？而且她現在的喊聲是不像舊年那般没氣力似的單聲了。而是像唱小調似的脆響的喊着：</p>
<p>『阿要粽子要哦？豆沙粽子，肉粽子』！</p>
<p>買的人便圍着她了。她很和氣，很隨便，少她個把銅子她也不很喜歡計較的。而尤其是停在人行直邊的人力車夫們，她是從不向他們討論虚價的。</p>
<p>丨丨他們也許比我還痛苦吧！她時常這麽想着，便連自己的生活痛苦也忘記了。</p>
<h3>談科學</h3>
<p>— 石膽</p>
<p>中國人近年來像是革命得多了，單講對於「洋鬼子」以及洋鬼子所做的一切什麽，也比「閉關」「打屁股」時代客氣多多，多多了。凡是洋鬼子有些新鮮花樣，我們中國人居然也肯學着弄一弄。不過使人掃興的，是：經過中國人弄一弄之後，那件東西常常會糢糊了原樣，或廣大無邊起來。譬如說，幽默文學，是洋鬼子要的新鮮花樣，一經中國人學着弄一弄之後，就一變爲小丑化。這可以說是糢糊了原樣。</p>
<p>科學在二十世紀，成了時代的寵兒。無論什麽，只要揭起這面堂皇漂亮的大旗，就到處可以通行無阻的。於是來了：畫上一張鬼臉，印上若干不同的字樣；加上一只碟子，用三個人來扶住，搗了一通鬼，這是科學！解僱若干工人，添上幾架機器，這，也是科學！</p>
<p>而今，居然着在脚上的鞋子也科學起來。據說是用「科學方法製造，着來交關舒齊。」這話未免講得過於天眞，天眞到使人不敢相信。人的脚有大有小，有肥有瘦，有尖有團，有狹有闊，恐怕就無從找出科學的定律來。按說呢，鞋子也不過是那麽一件東西，是長而略帶方形似盒子的東西，是着在脚上的。那末，自從有薄底走鞋以來，一向就是用「科學方法製造」的（粉底烏靴，硬挺挺的，不方便，當除外）。現在所謂種種，不過是從新揭起這面漂亮大旗而已。</p>
<p>現在又有一種聰明人閙起什麽科學化來，丨其實老早就有的丨那講起是很好玩的。點心外面包上一層白紙，這是科學化。中醫所說的「肝」要是說「神經」，這尤其是科學化了。飯館裏的桌子上，蒙上一方白布，加蓋一片玻璃，於是在報紙上大登其科學化科學化。而廚房裏仍舊是蒼蠅翁的跳舞塲。</p>
<p>據作者以爲：中國只有茶壺蓋上的那個洞跟，和水車是科學的。講到「科學化」，則殺頭改爲槍斃，倒是之一。</p>

<h3>節母坊（二）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>在時敏看來，一切都是新鮮和奇異的。在東邊山尖上，那兒露着乳白色的天，魚鱗似的雲層中，透着一些微紅，但是要非常仔細才能看得出。各色各樣的蟋蟀聲，四面八方圍着他在呌；有的是像吹麥桿似的尖聲，有的却是唧唧唧唧，還有唖着喉朧呌的蛇鳴，再還有高低不等的蛙聲。本來這些聲音，平常在院子裏桃樹下面乘凉，睡看數天上的星的時候，也可以聽見，不過今天聽來，總覺得特别够味。一切都是新鮮和奇異的。特别是蟋蟀的呌聽，更覺得十分親切。他自己默默的想想回頭我要在村裏捉許多蟋蟀回去，和姑母的大頭鬼大鬥一次，一定可以鬥得牠贏。姑母的蟋蟀都是在家裏園子裏捉的，决不會有眞正的老種，而在村裏和田坂上捉的，一定比那一隻大頭鬼强得多。姑母的蟋蟀是給高麗參水給牠吃的，而時敏却也知道母親的高麗參是放在梳頭匣子的第二個小抽屜裏，他一定也要偷一二片給自己的吃。養得肥胖胖的，還怕她的大頭鬼麽？一想到這裏，他是覺得一切都有意思，就連村裏的狗吠，也覺得是爲了他去而特别呌得起勁似的。</p>
<p>不多時，他們一羣連空籮鐮刀一同在村口大路旁邊的田裏停下了。不久，便在小主人的身邊開始了，鐮刀割稻的頂熟悉的聲音。再遠些，打禾的聲音像放鞭爆一樣連接起來。在淸晨絕早的時候，這種聲音夾在嘈雜的虫鳴中成爲一種音樂的韻律怪淸脆的。然而這些，在長工們聽來，並不覺得如何了不起的可愛，因爲這對於你們眞是太熟悉了。小主人雖然不懂得什麽是音樂的旋律，可是這一境遇，在他還是第一次遭遇。</p>
<p>不消說，史時敏一會兒便開始在捉蟋蟀了？就在那臨田的空園旁邊。但是天還没有大亮，祇聽見蟋蟀的呌聲，那蒼老的嘶破布似的，在他聽來一定是深黑腿長腰身的老蟋蟀，等他輕手輕脚的走過去的時候，却無論如何也没有方法捉住。於是他有着說不出的焦急，甚至於咒駡着；爲什麽還不天亮呢？於是他所能做到的，祇是在每一個自己中意的蟋蟀呌着的地方，插下一根樹枝，當作標記，且等待天明再來動手，一定逃不了的。就是這樣跑來跑去，他的布底鞋子已給草上的露水滲透了，冰冷的。這時候眞是大靜了。忽然他看見田裏幾個黑影在緩慢的動着，好像幾隻大甲虫，再想一陣那簡直就是鬼，於是他大聲喊呌，直向灰雞婆他們那兒跑去。後來經過他們的說明，那些都是割禾的人，他</p>
<p>也很相信，可是一想到鬼的頭上去，總覺得毛骨悚然，怪可怕的。</p>

They were received by Vice Consul Asami, who said that Kuraoto's mind was still unclear after returning to his residence. Dr. Matsumoto of Shanghai Fumin Hospital has come to Nanjing to treat him, and he will be going to Shanghai for treatment soon. The rumors about the reasons for his suicide are not sufficient and would not cause a person with a clear mind to commit suicide. The real reason will only be clear after his mind clears up. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Vice Minister Tang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs arrived in Nanjing from Jiangxi at 2:00 PM on the 13th. Upon hearing that Kuraoto had been found, he immediately went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle everything. When reporters visited him on the 14th and asked what he had talked about when he met with Kuraoto on the 13th, Tang said that because Consul General Suma was afraid that Kuraoto was too tired, he advised him to speak less, so he only offered simple condolences. Kuraoto said that he had explained everything to Director Shen in detail and asked if his hand sore had healed. However, when he spoke, his voice was very low. The reporter then asked what his thoughts were on this matter. Tang replied that, based on Kuraoto's personality, his usual behavior, and the circumstances of his departure that night, we have determined that it was a personal act. Yesterday, when we saw him crying, it seemed that he had unspeakable pain. Since he himself does not want to say it, outsiders are even less convenient to speculate. In short, we have great sympathy for Kuraoto and do not want to express too much. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed relief today at the safe discovery of Kuraoto and said that the authorities would decide how to handle the matter after a thorough investigation. The investigation will begin as soon as Kuraoto recovers his health and his mind returns to normal. He stated that after five days of suspicion, it has now been resolved, and the dim atmosphere in Sino-Japanese relations has been cleared. All the newspapers here have published the news of Kuraoto's discovery in large headlines. The Kokumin Shimbun said that the reappearance of the Japanese vice consul was a cause for celebration for both countries in terms of friendly relations between China and Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Consulate General authorities have not been able to question Vice Consul Kuraoto, as his health has not yet recovered, and they cannot release any information about the motives and circumstances of his disappearance, so the truth is unknown. However, based on information and circumstances from various sources, he is a person with the most sensitive emotions, and he may have had thoughts of world-weariness. He sought a place to die in the forests at the foot of Zijin Mountain outside Nanjing. He did not die for three days and lived in a mountain nest, occasionally asking farmers for water and eggs, hoping to escape the world and await the arrival of the god of death. The motives for his world-weariness are kept silent by him, but there is no reason to believe that he had any problems in performing his duties as a public official, in his feelings towards his colleagues, in his livelihood, or in any incurable illness. Perhaps there is some deep-seated suffering in his family that is unknown. (Denstu dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Because Vice Consul Kuraoto returned safely and there were no signs of abduction, Consul General Suma will await instructions from his province regarding future actions. Meanwhile, last night, he consulted with the heads of the army and navy resident military attachés and the Consulate General. Today at 9:00 AM, he convened a meeting at his official residence with Deputy Consul Tanaka, Asami, and Chief Shimizu to discuss the matter for a long time. As a result, it was decided that they would issue a statement today, stating that Vice Consul Kuraoto, who had been missing since the 8th, had returned safely thanks to China's continuous efforts, and that they would express their deep gratitude to China. (Denstu dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Starting from noon, Consul General Suma will express his gratitude to the army and navy attachés and the Japanese representatives who cooperated in resolving the incident. It is scheduled to visit Foreign Minister Wang at his official residence starting at 4:00 PM this afternoon to express his deep gratitude for China's efforts in searching for Kuraoto. Next, he will visit the various relevant Chinese parties to express his gratitude in the same way. (Denstu dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Vice Consul Kuraoto, who spent his first night back at his residence with his family, is still being monitored by the Consulate General authorities this morning, and all meetings have been declined in order to allow him to calm down his excitement. Because of fears of suicide, consular staff are being assigned to rotate shifts to monitor him, and strict precautions are being taken. (Denstu dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dr. Matsumoto examined Vice Consul Kuraoto from 10:00 AM to 12:40 PM. After the examination, Dr. Matsumoto told reporters that he had symptoms of neurasthenia, which seemed to be a complete manifestation of thoughts of world-weariness. At present, his nerves are still excited and have not calmed down, but his health is gradually recovering. (Denstu dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 10:00 AM today, Consul General Suma convened all the consular staff in the Consul General's office to describe the details of the Kuraoto incident. At the same time, he severely admonished the consular staff regarding the future, saying that since they are serving in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they should be aware that they are representatives of the Empire, serving as envoys to friendly countries, devoting themselves to the service of the sovereign and the country, and being willing to die for it. If they merely resort to acts of escape due to personal annoyance or suffering, causing trouble for friendly countries and disgrace to the sovereign and the country, this must be avoided. During the instructions, he was tearful. The faces of the dozens of consular staff members were haggard from continuous day and night activities, and at this point, they dared not look directly at Consul General Suma's face. The whole place was silent. It can be seen that Consul General Suma's grief over the Kuraoto incident was revealed in his instructions. The meeting adjourned at noon. (Denstu dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 6:30 PM today, the Consulate General issued a statement summarizing the subsequent discussions. Vice Consul Kuraoto seemed to have had some feelings on the 8th, and he left the consular building, but at present, he urgently needs to rest. Because of fatigue and excitement, his words are incoherent, and the truth is difficult to determine. Also, Dr. Matsumoto of Shanghai Fumin Hospital, who came to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 14th, made the following diagnosis at 1:00 PM in the afternoon: Mr. Kuraoto has always been quite nervous and has a melancholy disposition, but there were no special symptoms. On the night of June 8th, he had a nervous breakdown and his spirit was abnormal, so he went missing. After returning home on the afternoon of June 13th, he rested, but due to physical and mental fatigue, and still being in a state of hypersensitivity, he lacked thought and his pulse fluctuated, occurring frequently and vigorously. Although it is not possible to conduct a detailed examination at present, it is indeed a case of extreme neurasthenia. For the time being, he needs to avoid surrounding stimulation and rest peacefully. (Denstu dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Osaka: Upon receiving the first report of Vice Consul Kuraoto's survival, we visited Kuraoto's mother and sister, who were staying at the Kurokawa residence in Koshien. His mother was so grateful that she shed tears, saying that she had prayed to Nishinomiya Kōdai-shi and now hearing of his survival was like a dream. Many people went to congratulate the family, and the whole family turned from sorrow to joy. Kuraoto's hometown of Oda Village in Soeda County, Nara Prefecture, was filled with joy. Village chief Ota and friends such as Mr. Kondo were overjoyed. (Denstu dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Vice Consul Kuraoto recovers his health and the truth is clarified, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seems to be adopting a stable approach to resolving the incident with the Nanjing government. The incident is not expected to hinder Sino-Japanese relations and is naturally hoped to become closer. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Consul General Suma's handling of this matter was entirely appropriate and that he does not need to resign. This will be telegraphed to Consul General Suma soon. (Denstu dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Consul General Suma visited President Wang at the Railway Department's office at 4:00 PM today. Vice Minister Tang Youren was also present. Suma said to Wang that the Kuraoto incident had been safely resolved through the careful actions of the parties involved and the efforts of the Chinese authorities. He expressed his gratitude. Wang replied, "The satisfactory resolution of this case is not only a personal matter, but also an opportunity to clear away the misunderstandings that have surfaced between the two sides and to allow relations between the two countries to be restored after the storm. This is something that we can all rejoice in." Suma then excused himself and left at 4:30 PM. Consul General Suma then visited Police Chief Shen and Military Police Commander Gu to express his gratitude for their efforts in searching for Vice Consul Kuraoto. Shen and Gu both said that they were pleased with the unexpected outcome of the Kuraoto incident and that they felt that the sky had cleared after the storm. (Japan Federation dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops Ravage the Area Around Duolun. Bandits in Eastern Chahar Province Appear and Disappear Unpredictably.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A gentleman from a certain agency who was sent to Eastern Chahar Province for inspection talked about the severe oppression and exploitation after Duolun Xinyuan was occupied by the Japanese. In Fifty Family, the first district of Guyuan, more than 100 troops of Li Shouxin's puppet army were stationed. Duolun was garrisoned by the 7th Division of the Japanese Army and Li Shouxin's troops. Xinyuan Heidayingzi was stationed by 60 Japanese soldiers, and the defense was very strict. Several Japanese aircraft were parked at the Xinyuan Airport, and automobile transportation was very busy. Pseudo-troops often went shopping at the Pingdingbao Catholic Church, 25 miles north of Guyuan. The uniforms of the pseudo-troops were the same as those of the Japanese army. The Rehe-West military automobile road has been completed. Japan's coveting of Inner Mongolia has been long-standing, and the crisis in Eastern Chahar is worrying. Guyuan and Chicheng have repeatedly experienced turmoil and suffered heavy damage. When we arrived in Chicheng last month, all the shops in the city had closed down, and there were only two floating stalls left. The situation was too terrible to bear. Salt had long been exhausted. The houses of the people of Chicheng and Guyuan were all occupied by soldiers and bandits, and the roofs, doors, and windows were torn down for fuel. Their property was exhausted. Guyuan County lost 150,000 cattle and 520,000 sheep. Bandits in Eastern Chahar appear and disappear unpredictably. Between Shacheng and Dushikou, there is a saying that one fears Chang'anling, two fears Diaogou, and three fears Chicheng to Yunzhou, which shows that the three places are dens of bandits. Recently, after the garrison troops suppressed them, most of them have been cleared, and the rest are just small gangs. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Guangdong-Hong Kong Journalists Delegation Visits Various Tianjin Institutions, Departs for Shanhaiguan for Inspection Last Night, Yu Xuezhong Speaks to the Delegation</h3>

Except for three members staying in Tianjin temporarily, the rest, accompanied by Tianjin reporters, left for Shanhaiguan for inspection tonight and will return to Tianjin southward on the 16th. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong spoke to the Guangdong-Hong Kong Journalists Delegation, saying that since the establishment of the Tanggu Truce and the demarcation of the 29 counties of Luandong as a war zone, the Japanese side has adopted a serious attitude towards all diplomatic matters, large and small, in the past year, making it truly difficult to deal with. The country must unify and concentrate its strength to face the outside world. Therefore, he hoped that after returning to the South, they would do their best to communicate the situation in the North and South, so that everyone would know the dangerous situation in North China and the whole country would concentrate its strength to deal with the enemy. This afternoon, Zhang Boling spoke to the Journalists Delegation, saying that the Chinese people are too selfish and self-interested. Everyone knows that the Tanggu Truce is a treaty signed under duress, but although we are angry at the enemy, we hate our people's lack of ambition even more. If everyone can work together, we can still avenge our humiliation by enduring hardship and biding our time. If we still bravely engage in internal strife, are we not inviting our own destruction? The Southwest is not the Southwest of a few people. If there are still those who cling to selfish opinions, the press should rise up to oppose them. If a few people do not cooperate, they can be removed. If our people unite and cooperate, there is still hope. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Thoughts on the Arrest of Patriotic Man Deng Tiemei</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>The four northeastern provinces have been ravaged by the iron hooves of the Japanese army for more than two years. No matter how remote the village, it is threatened by the Japanese ruling forces. Those who can still raise the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun and maintain the era name of the Republic of China are the bases of the activities of the Volunteer Army. The two major triangular areas of eastern Jilin and eastern Andong are especially known as the strongholds of anti-Japanese forces. Deng Tiemei, the Commander-in-Chief of the Liaoning Self-Defense Army, who was recently sold and arrested, is the leader of the Volunteer Army in the Andong triangular area.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Deng has been engaging in anti-Japanese activities in the triangular area of Fengcheng, Xiuyan, and Andong, in conjunction with the troops of Peng Fei, Liu Jingwen, and Ao Xisan (namely Haijiao). Whenever he came into contact with the Japanese and puppet troops, he used ambushes to win. The area is located on the main road of traffic between Manchuria and Korea, and the Japanese regarded it as a thorn in their side, launching repeated attacks, but without success. Starting in February and March of this year, Deng's activities became even more vigorous. The puppet army Wang Dianzhong's troops even defected and joined forces. Deng then planned to go a step further, joining forces with the troops of Wang Fengge and Ren Fuxiang to launch a major uprising this summer when the green gauze curtains rose. Now, unfortunately, he was arrested before he could complete his mission. Alas!</p>
<p>The telegrams reported that Deng was on a hunger strike in prison, looking calm and composed. One said, "A good man does not eat the rice of a puppet country." The other said, "The activities of the Volunteer Army are to fulfill the responsibilities of Chinese citizens, and the anti-Japanese thought comes from patriotism." A few words, straight from the heart. How sincere! Since the decline of national morale, words that stir the heart and inspire vigilance have not been heard for a long time. Hearing this sound from the empty valley, one cannot help but be deeply moved and shed tears. In the late Song Dynasty, Wen Tianxiang was imprisoned in Yanjing and wrote the Song of Righteousness, which contained the lines, "This spirit is so vast, that it will last for ten thousand ages. It can pierce the sun and the moon, and what is life and death worth discussing?" Deng can be said to be able to inherit Wen's remaining spirit of serving the country and be a model for the people of the country.</p>
<p>It is easy to die generously, but difficult to die calmly. Looking at Deng's demeanor after entering prison, his death is indeed a calm death, and its value is even greater than dying out of temporary anger. For example, when two armies are fighting, the sound of drums and gongs can be heard, and artillery fire is exchanged, one's hair stands on end and one's eyes are wide open, blood boils and veins swell, and one fights the enemy with all one's might, first with weapons and then with hand-to-hand combat, or breaking legs and arms, or having one's stomach and brains splattered on the ground. Such deaths are mostly driven by temporary emotions, and there is little time to use reason. Therefore, although difficult, it is still easy. Since the September 18th Incident, those who advocated active resistance filled the world. Once time passed and the situation changed, they became discouraged and dispirited. Gradually, the pleasures of singing, dancing, and fine horses, and the offerings of wealth and status, lured and surrounded them, and the before and after were like two different people. Those who once took pleasure in dedicating themselves to saving the country can now use the excuse of humanity and peace to shirk their responsibilities, or blame the harsh environment to exonerate themselves. Thus, ten people advocate and a hundred respond, and it becomes a common practice. Knowing and doing are contrary, and they do not care at all. Those who can stick to the anti-Japanese and national salvation movement from beginning to end, even to the death, like Deng Tiemei, are truly rare and not often seen. This is why they are so valuable.</p>
<p>Today, I dare to tell the people of the country frankly that Deng's imprisonment means that there is little hope of survival. His death is for the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun, and for the era name of the Republic of China. Under the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun, there are countless tens of thousands of people who uphold the era name of the Republic of China. These tens of thousands of people cannot all be Deng, or do not have to all be Deng, but what must be clearly recognized is that the many anti-Japanese martyrs of the past all sacrificed for our motherland, for our descendants, and for human justice. Now, Deng has followed in the footsteps of these many patriots and sacrificed himself. If we regard Deng's death in the same way that the people of Qin regarded the fatness and leanness of the people of Yue, and remain indifferent, then once the country is destroyed, even if there is the rice of a puppet country, is it enough to eat?</p>

<h3>Chen Gongbo Talks About the Experience of Inspecting Nanyang and the Reasons for the Decline of Overseas Chinese Businesses</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo talked about the biggest reasons for the decline of overseas Chinese in Nanyang in recent years. It is said that in the past, indigenous people borrowed money from overseas Chinese as capital, and the interest rates were very high, several hundredths or fifty percent. In recent years, indigenous people have gradually become more astute and are protected by their local governments, making it unprofitable to lend money. Overseas Chinese in Nanyang can be divided into three classes: large capital merchants, medium-sized merchants, and coolies. Currently, the large capital and labor classes of overseas Chinese are barely maintaining themselves, while the future of medium-sized merchants is worrying. In recent years, our country's trade with Nanyang has been almost completely squeezed out by Japanese goods, and the dumping of Japanese goods is truly remarkable. A local governor told me that a certain Japanese product imported pays a cash tariff of 30 cents per piece, but the market price of the product is only 25 to 27 cents per piece. Excluding all raw material costs and transportation costs, the selling price is even lower than the tariff by three or five cents. This kind of dumping at any cost is incomprehensible. The promotion of our country's national products must first expand its market, and it is especially desirable to have a considerable exchange with the local government. For example, the Dutch East Indies has a trade surplus with China, while the Philippines has a trade deficit with China. These are all due to a considerable economic understanding in the government. China is the largest market for Dutch sugar products, but China's goods entering the Dutch East Indies are only ranked 13th. We must urgently find a way. Even trade with bandits seems to be in good shape, but the amount is very small, and the market in the Philippines is not in China but in the United States due to the relationship between the United States and the Philippines. If the Philippine Islands become completely independent in a few years, the situation will change by itself, and the trade surplus with the Philippines will also become a trade deficit. During my trip to various places, what I discussed with the local governments was the issue of exchange volume. If this can be realized in the future, it will be of some help to China's foreign trade. In addition to exchanging opinions with the local governments in Nanyang, we have also reached an agreement with the Java Shipping Company to reduce freight rates for domestic goods, etc., and have made considerable decisions. We will first hire several experts to conduct long-term research, and then decide on a plan to promote domestic goods in Nanyang and submit it to the Central Government for adoption. Saving overseas Chinese can be said to have become a thing of the past, or it can be said that there is no way to talk about it. First, the government's financial resources are really not enough to save overseas Chinese. Medium-sized overseas Chinese in Nanyang account for 70 percent, and there is no financial strength to save them. Second, the government's expression of saving overseas Chinese only refers to unemployed workers in Singapore. Now, the unemployed workers in that port have returned to the country one after another, and those who remain have employment and can also be said to have become a thing of the past. Chen Jiageng's company has been closed, and the government initially wanted to subsidize its recovery. I had discussed this with President Wang before my trip. Later, when I arrived in Singapore, the factory said that due to various dumping of foreign goods and other reasons, even if the government provided benevolent assistance to start business, it would be extremely difficult to maintain it, and they did not want to resume business again, so as not to disappoint the government's good intentions in the future. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 11:00 pm on the 13th. On the 14th, he told reporters about his experience in inspecting Nanyang, saying that this time he passed through more than 20 places, including Annam, the Malay Peninsula, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippine Islands. Our trade with the Philippines is still good, and trade with the Malay Peninsula is also balanced. The anti-Chinese tide in Singapore has become a thing of the past. Now that the price of tin has stabilized somewhat, overseas Chinese are welcome to go there. A lot of Javanese sugar is imported into our country, but the number of our country's goods imported into that place is only ranked 11th. He has discussed the issue of exchange volume with the local government and will make a decision after research. The government originally planned to allocate 300,000 yuan to Chen Jiageng's factory to help it resume business, but the factory still has many difficulties and it is temporarily difficult to resume work. The livelihood of overseas Chinese in Nanyang, apart from laborers, is mainly large capital merchants, and the remaining 75 percent are small and medium-sized merchants, who find it difficult to maintain their livelihoods. According to my investigation, I plan to hire experts to study and reorganize in order to improve our trade with Nanyang. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>An Important Page in European History, The Two Iron-Fisted Leaders of Italy and Germany Meet in Venice, Political Talks Begin Yesterday Afternoon, The Situation in Central Europe Will Have a New Turn, Austria Asks the Italian Prime Minister to Pay Attention to the Terrorist Activities of the National Socialist Party</h3>
<p>Venice - German Chancellor Hitler, accompanied by diplomats and secretaries, fifteen people in total, flew rapidly from Munich in two planes, arriving here at 9:58 this morning. He landed at the Lido seaplane field, where Italian Prime Minister Mussolini personally came to welcome him. They immediately boarded a small motorboat and sailed to the Grand Hotel to stay. They are going to Stra to hold a major meeting in history. This meeting was initiated by Mussolini as a final effort to persuade Germany to return to Geneva and save disarmament. The Disarmament Conference is now adjourned indefinitely, pending off-site negotiations with Germany, because a disarmament treaty without Germany's participation is difficult to achieve. Mussolini is confident that he can shoulder this important task and invited the German Chancellor to Venice. (National telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Venice - After arriving here, German Chancellor Hitler, accompanied by his entourage, took a small boat to Rome Square in the city at noon and landed. Then, a car took the group to the residence of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Stra. Mussolini hosted a banquet in the residence to welcome the German Chancellor. Thirty people attended the banquet. After the banquet at 1:00 pm, the Prime Ministers of Italy and Germany held political talks. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>The Grand Occasion of Welcoming the German Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Venice - German Chancellor Hitler, along with Foreign Minister Neurath and several Social Democratic Party leaders, flew from Munich to the Venice Airport at 10:05 this morning, escorted by Italian planes. When the plane carrying the German Prime Minister landed, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, dressed in Fascist uniform, led Blackshirt comrades to welcome him at the airport. The military band played the German national anthem. After the two Prime Ministers exchanged greetings, the German Prime Minister inspected the guards, who were Italian marines, all dressed in black and yellow uniforms. The host and guests then took a motorboat to Venice. Warships in the port fired salute cannons in salute. When Hitler arrived at the Grand Hotel, the crowd cheered "Long live." This afternoon, the German Prime Minister will go to Stra, ten miles west of Venice, to accept the Italian Prime Minister's hospitality. After that, the two Prime Ministers will hold the most important talks in world history, discussing world affairs. Italians will hold a concert in the Doge's Palace at 8:00 pm tonight, and both Prime Ministers will attend. About 400 people will attend, and 200 boats will hold a lantern parade on the Grand Canal at the same time. This morning, Italian newspapers only carried news of the German Prime Minister's visit and expressed their welcome, but there was no commentary on the purpose of his visit. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>The Nature of the Talks is Important</h3>
<p>Venice - Prime Minister Mussolini and German Chancellor Hitler will hold their first meeting today. However, as of now, the nature of the meeting between the two giants and the content of their talks are still unknown to the outside world. The reasons for this are twofold: first, the Prime Minister and the German Chancellor's close associates are keeping the content of the meeting strictly confidential, refusing to reveal a word; second, both Prime Ministers are in extraordinary positions, and their personal meeting is the first time, so it is difficult to predict the nature of the meeting. The outcome of this meeting depends entirely on whether the meeting can generate mutual sympathy. The environment of the meeting is also unusual, because on the first day, the two giants are meeting alone, and the Astra Palace, where the meeting is held, is far from the city. In short, no matter what the meeting procedure is, the talks between the two giants will change according to the situation, and the meeting procedure seems to be intentionally made broad. This meeting has been prepared by diplomatic procedures for three weeks, but we should know that in addition to the usual diplomatic relations, there is often a direct relationship between Mussolini and Hitler, and the latter's nature is more important than the former. Their direct relationship may be through the Prime Ministers personally sending personnel to communicate with each other, or through the Fascist Party and the National Socialist Party acting as intermediaries. In addition, there are two facts that indirectly contributed to this meeting: one is the renewed activities of the National Socialist Party in Austria, which is a matter for Germany; the other is the superficial expression of Franco-Italian friendship, which is a matter for Italy. Politically speaking, both giants have something to use as bargaining chips. According to Italian sources, Italy's attitude towards Austria remains unchanged, and its opposition to German interference in Austria's internal affairs remains the same as before. If Germany hopes to share influence with Italy in Austria, it will be rejected by Italy. In addition to the Austrian issue, the situation created by the Anglo-French-American disarmament compromise on the 8th of this month will of course also be discussed. However, there is no news about this matter. However, it is generally said that this matter is very important. Italian sources also said that this meeting should not be regarded as one to deal with France, because the Italian government had unofficially notified the French and British governments of this move several weeks ago.

<h3>The German Government Issues a Notice</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The talk between Hitler and Mussolini, which has been rumored for a long time, was only officially announced tonight. The wording of the announcement is very simple, only stating that "the Italian leader and Hitler have long had the intention to recognize each other and discuss the general political situation, so the two leaders have now decided to meet in Venice on Thursday." (National telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>The Italian Prime Minister Arrives First</h3>
<p>Venice - Prime Minister Mussolini, accompanied by his son-in-law Ciano (former minister to China), arrived at the Astra Palace late tonight. According to the Roman Official Gazette this morning, Chancellor Hitler and Foreign Minister Neurath will also arrive here at 10:00 am today and go directly to Astra for a meeting with Mussolini. Hitler and others are coming by plane from Munich. Officials here say that the two Prime Ministers will hold their first meeting this afternoon, but cannot confirm it specifically. (National telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Venice - As soon as the Prime Minister arrived at the palace, he discussed the talks and reception procedures for Thursday and Friday. Deputy Minister Suvich then went to a hotel in Venice. The people of Venice seem uninterested in this matter at the moment. The local newspapers do not mention it at all, as if they do not know that there will be an important international meeting near here tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Attendants Gather</h3>
<p>Venice - Diplomats from both Germany and Italy have begun to gather here to prepare for the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini. The German delegation has chosen the Grand Hotel here as the residence for most of its personnel. The Italian delegation is expected to arrive tonight, and Italian Ambassador to Germany Cerruti has already arrived. (National telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Rome Remains Silent</h3>
<p>(London) According to official Berlin, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Chancellor Hitler will discuss the general political situation when they meet in Venice today. Officials in Rome remain silent on this matter. Bicchieri's residence has been busy with repairs for several months and has been equipped with electric lights and water pipes. The residence is surrounded by a brick wall ten feet high and one and a half miles long. This week, 300 soldiers have been stationed around it for protection. The Italian Prime Minister will stay in the residence. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Rome - Although the newspapers here are full of news about the meeting between Mussolini and Hitler, they mostly do not comment on it, only describing the impressions of the foreign side on this move as telegraphed by the newspapers' reporters. Among them, only the "Messenger" published a commentary, recognizing that the meeting was a major event, saying that at a time of European diplomatic turmoil, the meeting of the two Prime Ministers would ease the situation.

<h3>Venice Conference: Promoting Italian-German Unity - German Press Commentary</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The historical meeting between Prime Minister Mussolini and Chancellor Hitler in Venice today has aroused worldwide amazement and speculation. This morning, newspapers across Germany featured the news of the two leaders' meeting on their front pages, and refuted criticisms from foreign newspapers regarding the significance of the event. Rosenberg, the chief editor of the National Socialist Party's official newspaper, published an article today titled "The Historical Meeting between Hitler and Mussolini," arguing that the meeting was significant enough to transform modern world history. He stated that the decline of democracy and the brutality of Marxist followers were spreading throughout Europe. The two leaders would rescue Europe from this abyss. He claimed that secret orders were being disseminated from the centers of European activity, instructing party members to concentrate their efforts and distance themselves from Fascism and nationalism. Their goal, he said, was to create animosity between Germany and Italy, and other forces were trying to recreate the imperialist mindset of 1914, to draw in Allied nations, and using financial and other pressures to force other countries to oppose a resurgent Germany. All these issues would be topics for discussion between the two statesmen, who bear the significant mission of their countries and of Europe, and who would ultimately find a way to complete the unification of the two nations.

<h3>Austria Closes Western Border to Prevent Nazi Atrocities</h3>
<p>Vienna - The chief of public safety of Vorarlberg, Austria's westernmost province, has ordered a complete border closure to prevent the spread of terrorist atrocities. Even farmers living near the border are forbidden from crossing, with the order stating that the closure will remain in effect until the atrocities cease. The order also alleges that Germans are crossing the border at night to commit violence. Simultaneously, the Austrian government has sent to the Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs all materials proving that the unrest in Austria is instigated by Germans. However, the Austrian government hopes to ease tensions and has not taken the intrusive measures demanded by the Home Guard, the Austrian Fascist faction. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Vienna - It is reported that before the meeting between German Chancellor Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Venice, the Austrian government requested that Mussolini pay attention to the recent actions of Germany towards Austria, stating that the German National Socialist Party was using terrorist tactics and engaging in aggression in Austria, and using the name of the Communist Party as a cover. When Hitler arrived in Venice, newspapers in Vienna spared no effort in exposing the terrorist actions committed by Germany under the guise of the Communist Party. For example, the "Federal Post" stated, "The German government's various anti-Austrian propaganda efforts deliberately claim to be the work of the Communist Party. The credibility of German statements has from this point on been completely ruined." (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>

If its border were invaded, Belgium would appeal to nations that uphold their treaty obligations, and he was confident that those nations would act without hesitation and come to Belgium's aid. Therefore, Belgium must take various measures so that, in the event of an invasion, allied nations could assist the Belgian army at suitable locations. (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Disarmament Committee Meets - Discusses Implementation Guarantees for Conventions - Russian Representative Argues for Universality - Japanese Representative Yokoyama Retains Reservations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The committee of the Disarmament Conference discussing arms control and implementation guarantees for disarmament conventions met today. The chairman, Belgian representative Bourquin, and the French delegation pointed out the close relationship between implementation guarantees, arms control, and regional mutual assistance agreements. Japanese representative Yokoyama reiterated the general reservations previously expressed by Sato regarding arms control issues, stating that these reservations could still apply to the issue of implementation guarantees for disarmament conventions. Under these circumstances, it would be difficult for Japan to actively participate in the work of the committee. In light of Japan's reservations, Soviet representative Stein stated that the Soviet delegation believed that all obligations regarding arms control and convention implementation guarantees should be universal. The Soviet representative had stated this repeatedly. But, regardless, the Soviet Union would continue to participate in all the work of the committee. Representatives from the United States and Poland then exchanged views. The committee decided to entrust Chairman Bourquin with contacting the delegations of various countries to study in advance the various issues that should be raised at the next meeting.

<h3>London Deploys Air Defenses - Air Force Increased to Eleven Squadrons Stationed Around the City - Setting Up an Aerial Net to Prevent Enemy Aircraft Bombing</h3>
<p>(London) The air force defending London has been increased by one bomber squadron, with four more squadrons scheduled to be added this year. This is one of them. In the future, the air force specifically designated to defend London will be increased to eleven squadrons, stationed at airfields in the west, north, and northwest of London. The mission of these bomber squadrons is as follows: when London is attacked by enemy aircraft, the bombers will fly to enemy positions and bomb them in retaliation. Another fighter squadron is stationed southeast of London, and its mission is to provide cover for the bomber squadrons. In addition, the Daily Mail reports that the Air Ministry is currently working on another plan to strengthen London's air defenses. The method involves using a new type of balloon to deploy an extremely large net at a height of several thousand meters in the direction from which enemy aircraft are approaching. The net is made of extremely fine steel wire, making it difficult to see. If an aircraft touches the net, it will immediately crash. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>Warsaw - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels arrived here at 3:10 PM on the large aircraft "Hindenburg," an hour earlier than scheduled. Accompanying him were seven members of the Propaganda Ministry and seven journalists. The German ambassador to Warsaw, the Polish Minister of Interior, the Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Zaikinski, the chairman of the Warsaw International Cultural Association, were all present at the airfield to welcome him. Goebbels's visit to Poland was at the formal invitation of Zaikinski. (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Warsaw - Although German Propaganda Minister Goebbels's visit here is ostensibly for lectures, he has been busy meeting with Polish leaders, and the public is paying close attention. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Warsaw - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech today at the Polish Intellectual Society here. His topic was "National Socialist Germany as a Nation Promoting European Peace." Goebbels's main points were roughly the same as those previously declared by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, namely that National Socialism, like Fascism, is only suitable for domestic application and is not meant for export. Goebbels stated that German National Socialism is limited to domestic construction. As for foreign affairs, Germany is no different from other countries, with the aim of engaging with the outside world and protecting important national rights. Therefore, there is no special promotion of National Socialism in foreign policy. Goebbels continued by discussing the true meaning of the National Socialist revolution, stating that no previous German government had received the support of the entire nation as the current National Socialist government has. In the national election on November 12 of last year, 92% of the people supported the National Socialist government. The National Socialist government is truly a united government of the entire nation. Goebbels then listed the major achievements of the National Socialist government in the seventeen months since its formation, to show the effectiveness of the united cooperation of the entire nation. Regarding the Jewish issue, Goebbels said that before Hitler came to power, Jewish capital accounted for the majority of the nation's investments and enjoyed absolute freedom in the media, literature, theater, and film industries. In major cities such as Berlin, Jews accounted for 75% of physicians and lawyers, and their usurious lending practices were on the verge of bankrupting the countryside. In addition, they manipulated public opinion, controlled financial transactions, and held sway over Congress and political parties, demanding whatever they wanted, and being arrogant and domineering. In reality, the Jewish population accounted for only 9% of the total population. Therefore, Germany's exclusion of Jewish citizens is a defensive strategy that must be adopted. As for the various news stories of abuse and terror that have been spread abroad, most of them are fabricated. A little investigation will reveal that they are not credible. Goebbels then discussed Hitler's efforts in peaceful construction, citing the new understanding established with Poland as proof. He further discussed Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and its abandonment of its seat in the Disarmament Conference. Goebbels declared that Germany is a nation that cherishes honor and will only engage with nations that can reciprocate with honor, not just verbal equality. Polish Foreign Minister Beck will host a banquet tomorrow to entertain Goebbels and is scheduled to receive him in audience with the Polish President tomorrow afternoon. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Grand Maneuvers off Sasebo Port - More Than Sixty Warships Participating</h3>

<h3>Situation of Russian Military Deployment in the Far East</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph's correspondent, after arriving in Manchuria from Europe, telegraphed the newspaper that there were large-scale military preparations along the entire Trans-Siberian Railway. Various troops were concentrated in the area from Irkutsk to Manchuria. Trains heading east were full of soldiers and munitions. Chita was the location of the headquarters of General Galen, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Far East Army. The correspondent personally saw fifty fighter planes and nine new hangars there, each capable of accommodating forty small planes or fifteen large planes, as well as numerous oil tanks and barracks. Soviet authorities did not hide this, but stated clearly that these preparations were purely for self-defense. The correspondent said that he was initially skeptical, but now he was convinced of the strength of the Soviet Far East Army, which he heard comprised 300,000 soldiers and 4,000 aircraft. It was said that the purpose of this law was specifically for the Far East, where a major industrialization drive was underway to enable the troops to be self-sufficient.

<h3>Germany Announces Six-Month Suspension of Debt Payments - Young and Dawes Plans Included - England, America, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands Most Affected - Declares German Currency Will Not Be Inflated or Devalued</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Deutsche Bank announced today that, effective July 1, all long-term and medium-term debt payments will be suspended for six months. Reparations under the Young Plan and the Dawes Plan are also included in the suspension. The proposals made by Germany to creditor nations at the debt conference on May 29 will also be implemented unilaterally. The announcement also stated that rumors abroad that Germany would implement an inflation policy were unfounded, as Germany had the power to maintain British financial stability. If Germany were unable to purchase raw materials on the world market in the future, it would not be Germany's fault. The suspension notice also affected American debt. All parties were surprised that the Dawes and Young Plans were also included in the suspension. However, Deutsche Bank President Schacht declared that Germany had no intention of implementing an inflation policy or devaluing the mark. This statement slightly eased everyone's concerns. The countries most affected by this suspension declaration are England, America, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and France. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(New York) The international financial market has become more turbulent again. The German mark is about to be devalued, and the economic and financial crisis has made Europe uneasy. The devaluation of the German mark will cause gold standard countries to abandon the gold standard, and will lead to the further realization of the international gold standard agreement. This agreement can equalize exchange rates and reduce the adverse effects of the devaluation of the German currency. However, Wall Street believes that if Germany adopts the old tactics of the war and implements a large-scale inflation policy, the result will be harmful to the world's finance and commerce. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Brussels - The German Central Bank recently announced that all commercial payments to various countries by the country's clearing houses in marks will be suspended for fifteen days. As a result, Belgium's claims against Germany cannot be recovered. This matter has caused a very bad impression in Belgium. The Belgian government has ordered its ambassador in Berlin to protest to Germany. The Chief Auditor of the National Bank of Belgium has recently submitted a report. The government will decide what measures to take after reviewing the report. In addition, the news that the German mark will soon be devalued has also made the Belgian business community feel uneasy. They all say that once this happens, Belgium's economic interests will inevitably be threatened. (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) People in Basel, Switzerland, are closely observing the development of Germany's economic and financial situation. According to several people familiar with the German situation, Germany is about to announce a complete suspension of payments on foreign debt, both principal and interest. The weak attitude of the creditor countries is the reason for this. At the recent conclusion of the Berlin debt conference, Germany proposed that 40% of foreign debt, principal and interest, be repaid in cash. Representatives of all creditor nations, except the Netherlands and Switzerland, seemed prepared to accept. However, it should be noted that even this 40% minimum is not guaranteed, because Dr. Schacht, President of the German Central Bank, can manipulate the value of the mark at will to create a situation that proves Germany is unable to pay. It is generally stated that Germany has been buying up its own German bonds on various countries' markets at low prices for a year, amounting to a huge 100 million marks. Therefore, German industry's debt can be said to have already been discharged. Once the value of the mark is devalued, it can resume activity, and the unemployment problem can also be solved.

<h3>British and American War Debt Issues - Hull Explains America's Attitude - Does Not Wish to Pay Debt with Goods</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States, fearing that yesterday's note might cause misunderstanding, stated today that the United States has not suggested accepting goods in payment of war debts. Secretary of State Hull had suggested in his note to British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay that the US would welcome the payment of debt with goods. The White House clarified this point, saying that the economic payment of debt with goods is not really possible. The US government does not want to open the American market to accept foreign goods in order to allow debtor countries to repay their debts to the US, but it will listen to any suggestions for paying part of the debt with goods. The American note reiterated that the nature of British debt to the US is different from that of Allied debt to Britain. The repayment of war debts to the US has never been related to Britain's recovery of debt from the Allied nations. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The Associated Press learned today that Britain has decided to remit the American war debt due on Friday, and will not make any further payments, because unless the entire debt is paid off, even a credit payment will not remove Britain's name as a debtor. It is learned that the British government may not be able to sign a reply to the United States tomorrow. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>US Also Refuses to Pay German Debt - House Passes Resolution</h3>
<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives today resolved to suspend payment of debt owed to the German people until Germany determines when to pay debt owed to the US. The Senate can also pass this bill immediately. This bill does not need to be sent to President Roosevelt for approval, as the government has no right to change international debt, and this power is entirely in the hands of Congress. The German government has not yet indicated whether it will pay the upcoming principal and interest of $50 million US. Germany may only pay interest and not principal. The total principal is approximately 122 million marks. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Silver Act - Sent to Roosevelt for Signature - Senate Amendments Passed by House</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Silver Act was sent to the White House this afternoon for President Roosevelt to sign. This afternoon, after re-submitting the Silver Act, the House immediately passed the Senate amendments to avoid delaying the implementation date. The Senate amendments passed by the House today are as follows: (1) The Pittman Amendment, which stipulates that only speculators pay a 50% tax on profits from silver. (2) The McCarran Amendment, which stipulates that silver certificates issued by the Treasury for the purchase of silver must be circulated in the market. However, experts say that the McCarran Amendment does not affect the Silver Act. Observers here indicate that the President has the freedom to handle the amount and date of purchase during the period of raising the silver reserve to 25% of total reserves, so the ultimate benefit of the Silver Act to the status of silver cannot be predicted. It is also unknown how much of the coined silver will circulate in the market. Pittman explained his amendment to the Associated Press, saying that all daily commercial transactions, such as foreign exchange, are not bound by the profit tax. Anyone engaged in legitimate business does not have to pay profit tax. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>

<h3>The People of Various Counties in Eastern Jilin Suffer Greatly from Japanese Military Atrocities: Burning, Killing, Raping, and Plundering Without Doing Anything Evil; Secret Execution Machines Set Up in Changchun; Deadly Harm Done in the Name of Vaccination</h3>
<p>According to people from Jilin, since the leaders of the Volunteer Army rose up to kill the enemy, the Japanese army has been running around non-stop. Therefore, whenever the Volunteer Army passes through any place, the local people are regarded as having aided the Volunteer Army, so they burn, kill, rape, and plunder, doing everything evil. Furthermore, secret execution machines have been set up in places such as Toudaohai in Changchun. In Huachuan County, in the name of vaccination for public health, the cowpox vaccine used contains deadly toxins. It is said that hundreds of people have been harmed. From this, we can see a glimpse of the Japanese bandits' brutality.</p>
<p>In April, twelve Japanese soldiers were traveling from Yilan to Bo, passing through the woods outside Wang Yue's store in Xinkalun. A farmer surnamed Hao was seen by the Japanese army hunting in the woods with a foreign gun and was immediately shot dead. In addition, more than 20 people, including Wang Yue's seven nephews, Li Hai's father and son, the entire Chen family of seven nearby, and Zhang Haishan's third son, were simultaneously shot to death with machine guns in the area. Moreover, 42 Japanese military vehicles, engaged in a fierce battle with the forces of the Volunteer Army leader Chuan Jinting in Yilan. After the Volunteer Army retreated, the Japanese army took the opportunity to burn to death more than 2,000 elderly people, children, women and babies of 300 households in the 4th District 9th Li 6th area of Yilan, including the merchants Fuhua Wangxi Oil Workshop, the residents Kang Xijiu, Ma Wanlu, Li Zhifa, Yan Gongqin, and Hu Manzi. Additionally, due to Volunteer Army leader Xie Wendong leading his troops to attack Mengjiagang, Hunan Camp, and Wuzhen in Huachuan County, the Japanese army regarded the residents of these three towns as having acted in support of the Volunteer Army. Without waiting for the Volunteer Army to attack the areas above, they first set fire to them, and about 6,000 innocent civilians suffered. Furthermore, a civilian household, Xu Changhe, in Hunan Camp Town North, had a beautiful young wife, Tian. Three Japanese soldiers suddenly became lustful, expelled everyone from Xu's home, and used coercive methods to act in an abusive way. Having suffered such extreme humiliation, Tian has reportedly hanged herself. Moreover, Wang, the beautiful wife of Xu Xingzhai, who lived in Jiuliliu Street, was also insulted by the Japanese army almost to the point of death. Also, the thirteen-year-old daughter of Yang Qingshan of Duigouzi Village and the fourteen-year-old daughter of Wang Youcai, a resident near the Yang family, were both subjected to violence by the Japanese army, and have died from the pain. Major Commander Tetsuomi Higashinomiya, in Jiamusi Street in Zhanchuan County, under the pretext of promoting hygiene, forced the local people to be vaccinated. The vaccination method was to have his soldiers hold small knives and block pedestrians at the intersections of city streets, strip off their clothes, cut them on the arm with a knife, and apply a medicinal paste. Seven days after being vaccinated, the arms of those who were vaccinated became red, swollen, blue, and purple, and then festered severely. It is heard that more than 400 people have been killed by poison, all of whom are male strong men. The malicious and insidious intentions of the Japanese are something that we people of the Northeast will have no respite from.</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese army has secretly set up human-squeezing machines in places such as West Xiaohuaishugouzi in Toudaogou, Changchun, and East Sankeshu in Harbin. Their method of killing people is to first use heavy money to buy off rogues, traitors, and dregs of society who smoke opium and inject morphine, so they can scout for Volunteer Army members or enlightened youths who are temporarily hiding everywhere. Anyone who is unwilling to submit to the Japanese is considered to be acting against "Manchukuo." The Japanese army immediately sends investigators to demand the persons, and regardless of whether the information is true or false, they are pushed into the man-squeezing machine and ground into mincemeat in an instant, and washed away with the water. Such vicious acts are not only rare but unheard of in today's world. It is estimated that more than a thousand people have suffered this horrific massacre. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Qian Army Intercepts and Suppresses He's Bandits, Xiang Army also Dispatches Chen Quzhen's Division to Assist in Suppression; You Guocai Takes Office as Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Communists in various places, because of the successive encirclements by large armies from various provinces, and with the Southeast Armies succeeding in seizing Junmen and Liancheng, the Peng and Ye factions in central Jiangxi have been trapped in a jar. He Long's faction in Sichuan, after being besieged by the Sichuan Army, has recently transformed into roaming bandits, fleeing eastward into Guizhou. Wang Jialie's troops in Guizhou dispatched Li Chengzhang's brigade of the 25th Army, leading three regiments of elite soldiers, from Guiyang to Zunyi, to join forces with Jiang Pixu's troops to suppress them. After more than ten days of fierce fighting, He's bandits were unable to hold out on the 2nd of this month, and a portion fled back to the Sichuan border. The Guizhou army recaptured Wucheng and Zhuoshui counties. Wang Jialie reported in a telegram on the 4th, saying, "The Communist bandit He Long has fled into the territory of Guizhou. I have ordered the military corps of each county and transferred three elite regiments to vigorously encircle and suppress him. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers fought bravely, and after ten days of fierce battle, the bandits were unable to hold out, and retreated to the Sichuan border on the winter [2nd]. The three counties of Zhuoshui and Wucheng have been recovered, and we are working on post-war reconstruction and pacification of the area. The overall precarious situation in Guizhou has become stable. I am informing you especially." Wang Jialie, branch seal. Since the Guizhou army recovered Zhuoshui and other counties, due to military concerns, it temporarily stopped the pursuit. Unexpectedly, the Sichuan bandits, unable to succeed, reunited with more than 10,000 Communist bandits from Shihe in western Hubei to invade Guizhou again. The situation in eastern Guizhou has become tense again. Wang Jialie's Guizhou army has now transferred ten or more regiments to intercept. According to a telegram from Zheng Shaoqi, Director of the Department of Finance of Guizhou Province, He Long's bandit troops fled into the Houping border of Wuchuan at the end of last month. It is reported that more than 10,000 bandits from Shihe in western Hubei are moving towards Youyang, Xiushan, Qianjiang and Pengshui, colluding with He's bandits, plotting to disrupt southern Sichuan and northern Guizhou. The situation in eastern Guizhou is extremely urgent. We have transferred more than ten regiments of troops to defend and suppress them separately. Mr. Shao, for the sake of local safety and security, is striving to destroy the bandit scourge and complete unification. To fellow villagers overseas, we especially hope that you understand the situation in Guizhou, and can help us overcome the difficulties of the time. Your Nong [You Guocai] telegraphed Mr. Shao [Wang Jialie]." Wang Jialie telegraphed on the East [1st] day, taking office as Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression. Did the two Guangdongs receive the telegram? Please tell me. Xinkou First, Ge [5th] seal, etc. It has recently been heard that the bandit forces on the Guizhou border are growing, which is also unfavorable to Hunan. He Jian, Chairman of Hunan Province, for the sake of the inter-dependent relationship, has also dispatched Chen Quzhen's division stationed on the Hunan border to Guizhou to assist the Guizhou army in suppressing the bandits. He's bandits, being attacked from both sides, are likely to withdraw from the Guizhou border. As for You Guocai of the Guizhou army, he also took office as Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression of Guizhou Province on the 3rd. Wang Jialie has telegraphed to inform him, saying, "Please also tell fellow villagers that the turmoil in Guizhou has been prolonged, and the people are suffering deeply. Recently, He Long's bandit troops have invaded Guizhou again, and we must unite internally and make concerted efforts to alleviate the difficulties of our hometown. I have received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief You Nong [Guocai] on the East [1st] day, which opens, 'Chairman Wang of Guiyang: I am unworthy of being trusted, and have been given the position of Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression for the entire province of Guizhou. I respectfully took office at the military post in Huangzhouba on June 1st, and began using the official seal on that day. At this time of rampant red flames, I swear to exhaust my humble abilities to eliminate the chaos and disaster. In addition to reporting separately, I should telegraphically request you to take note and record it. Your officer You Guocai bows.' East [1st] seal, etc. Peace and unity, fortunately completed. I am especially telegraphing to inform you. We hope to release Jin Zhu." Wang Jialie Jiang [3rd] seal, [9th].</p>
<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to be Completed by End of Next Year; Vehicles have been Ordered from Germany; Hou Jiayuan Arrives in Jiangxi to Meet with Xiong Shihui</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Hou Jiayuan, Director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, arrived in the province by train from Liangjiadu on the 11th to discuss railway affairs with Provincial Chairman Xiong. According to Mr. Liang, the mission and progress of the railway are as follows:</p>
<h3>Discussing Railway Affairs</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau is organized by the Ministry of Railways and the governments of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. All progress on railway affairs must be in accordance with the intentions of the Ministry of Railways and the two provincial governments. I [Hou, referring to himself] set off from Hangzhou on the 4th and arrived in Nanchang today after inspecting the route along the way. The mission of this trip is to discuss the problem of requisitioning farmland and paying compensation with Chairman Xiong, because the farmers along the route are demanding very high prices, and the Railway Bureau's budget is limited, so it is difficult to pay them the full amount. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss with the Jiangxi Provincial Government to ensure that the interests of the people are not harmed while considering the government's financial resources. In addition, route issues also need to be discussed.</p>
<h3>Surveying Work</h3>
<p>The surveying work for the Yushan to Nanchang section of the railway has been completed. Because it was surveyed in sections, the work progressed quickly. However, the Shangrao to Hengfeng section only began surveying after Hengfeng was recovered. But the surveying team has been instructed to speed up their work and it should be completed within a month.</p>
<h3>Three-Part Project</h3>
<p>Currently, there is a call for merchants in Shanghai to contract for construction, with work expected to begin in early next month. The project is divided into three parts. The first part is the roadbed engineering, such as leveling hills and filling in depressions. Although the project is vast, it will be carried out in sections and is budgeted to be completed within seven months. After that, the second part, bridge construction, will begin, and in July of next year, the third part, track laying, will commence. If no unexpected difficulties arise, the entire line should be open to traffic by the end of next year.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Vehicles</h3>
<p>Regarding the application of vehicles, the cost of purchase will be covered by the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi provincial governments issuing public bonds worth 12 million, in addition to 8 million yuan borrowed against collateral from Shanghai banks, and another 8 million yuan borrowed in materials from Germany, with the public bonds worth 12 million serving as collateral and guaranteed by Shanghai banks. Therefore, the vehicles used must be purchased from Germany. Zeng Yangfu has already sent people to negotiate, and it is generally settled, but efforts are being made to keep prices low. In the future, when this road is completed, it will be of great benefit to national defense and the economy. (June 13th)</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government to Establish a Water County in Hongze Lake, Requesting Approval from Chairman Chiang to Send Personnel for Surveying</h3>
<p>Anqing dispatch: The Anhui Provincial Government, due to the increasing banditry in Hongze Lake, Si County, northern Anhui, has followed the instructions of the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Bandit Suppression Headquarters to establish a water county to maintain order throughout the lake and enhance security on the water. It has submitted a request to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to select appropriate personnel to go to the lake to survey the county. Recently, it received a petition from Zheng Guohuang and others, citizens of Si County, requesting the separation of Si and Hong for governance. Considering that the lake is planned to have a water county, and personnel have already been sent for surveying, the division of Si and Hong county governance is related to the establishment of the water county. A decision will be made after the establishment of the water county is determined, and the Civil Affairs Department has been ordered to comply. (12th)</p>
<h3>Repair of Temples of Confucius, Zhou Gong, Yanzi, Zisi, and Mencius; Central Government Allocates 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Jinan dispatch: Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, previously initiated the repair of the temples of Confucius, Zhou Gong, Yanzi, Zisi, and Mencius in Qufu and requested assistance from the central government. Yesterday, an instruction was received from the Executive Yuan, agreeing to provide a subsidy of 100,000 yuan. The order reads: "A case was received under the instruction of the National Government, approving the National Political Conference's letter, approving the government's transfer for review, the Ministry of Finance's compilation of the supplementary budget for the 22nd year of the Republic of China for the repair of the Temple of Confucius in Qufu and the subsidy for the temples of Zhou, Yan, Si, and Mencius. After being submitted to the Financial Group for review, it was reported that this case had previously been proposed by Committee Member Dai et al. at the 19th meeting of the National Government. Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, and other committee members telegraphed requesting the raising of funds for the repair of the Temple of Confucius in Qufu and the temples of Zhou, Yan, Si, and Mencius, proposing that the central government subsidize 100,000 yuan, which was resolved to be handled accordingly, ordering the Ministry to allocate funds, etc. Now, the chairman of the province has sent a telegram stating that this subsidy has not yet been allocated and requesting instructions. The Ministry of Finance, following the order of the Yuan, compiled a supplementary temporary budget for the subsidy and sent it to the Chief Accountant to request review. Upon review, there is nothing inappropriate, and it is proposed to approve this subsidy at 100,000 yuan and incorporate it into the national general budget for the 23rd year, etc." It was resolved at the 407th meeting of this conference to pass the review opinion. A corresponding record letter is issued, requesting that you examine and instruct compliance, etc. In accordance with this, it should be handled accordingly. In addition to replying and distributing separately, a joint order is issued to the Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Finance to comply and to notify the Provincial Government. This is the order."</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Vegetable Market to Use New Scales</h3>
<p>The National Government, considering that the old weights and measures in various provinces are inconsistent, not only failing to align with global standards but also hindering unification, is actively implementing a new system of weights and measures. The County Government has dispatched personnel to instruct various trade associations to encourage the implementation of the change, which has been largely adopted. However, the vegetable market, essential for daily life, still uses the old scales, inevitably causing conflicts with other industries that have already switched and incurring losses. This matter has come to the attention of the County Government, which has dispatched personnel to instruct all vegetable markets to uniformly adopt the new weights and measures for fair trade, in accordance with the law. It is reported that the vegetable markets have agreed to implement the change from the 20th of this month.</p>

Yesterday, the prosecutor, accompanied by the deceased's son, Wang Genbao, went to the scene of the incident for inspection. According to Wang Genbao, his father, Wang Jinsheng, was dragged from the bed to the alley by his mother, Wang Pan, and his brother-in-law, Chen Wanquan. Chen Wanquan then used scissors to cut his father's throat while his mother, Wang Pan, assisted by crushing his testicles. The body was discarded in the river.

<h3>Wuxi: Completion of Surveying for Huanhu Road</h3>
<p>The project of building a Huanhu Road in this county, after being initiated by Rong Desheng and other industrial magnates, has completed the construction of Baojie Bridge, located in the real industry area, which has sixty arches. The bridge foundation has already been built and is expected to be completed before August 15th. The roadbed for the entire road has also been surveyed by the County Construction Bureau, with a length of twelve kilometers and a specified width of seven meters. In order to actively promote the project, County Magistrate Yan Shenyu and Director of the Construction Bureau Zhang Fulin specifically invited Rong Desheng, Xue Mingjian, and Yu Nu, the district chief of the third district of the road, and Zhu Biao, the district chief of the fourth district, to the county for discussions to jointly plan the project. In addition to Baojie Bridge, the road requires the construction of fourteen bridges, costing 70,000 yuan. However, it is difficult to raise these funds, so Rong was asked to find a solution. As a result, Rong initially agreed to donate for the construction of two or three bridges, while the remaining ones will be built by the County Bureau. As for the name of the road, it was originally set as "Li Huanhu Road" and has now been changed to "Hushan Road". The goal is to complete it by the end of September and allow automobile traffic before Double Ten Day. Yan and Zhang went to the town yesterday (14th) at half past noon to attend the Southeast Transportation Week Exhibition in the Jiangsu Provincial Preparatory Committee on the 15th and present the road's draft plan to Director Shen Jian for review in order to start construction.</p>

<h3>Pinghu: Salt Smugglers Eat Living Person Alive</h3>
<p>There are many salt smugglers in the Jin Sinian Bridge area of this county, almost every household is involved. Feng Wenbin of the town rented out a house in Houtai to the anti-smuggling team. Because he had accumulated old grievances with the salt smugglers, and recently, anti-smuggling soldiers had come to the area to investigate, the smugglers suspected that Feng had invited them. Their resentment deepened. Yesterday, after the anti-smuggling team left, the salt smugglers rang gongs to gather a crowd of over 300 men, women, old, and young who poured into Feng's house. They dragged Wenbin out of bed, claiming to eat him alive. Then, they all bit him, covering him in blood, and causing bone and flesh to be scattered everywhere. When the smugglers saw that Feng had fainted, they dispersed. The Zha Pu Chengji Hospital received a telegram from Feng's house reporting the incident and urgently sent doctor Yan Jiesheng to rescue him.</p>

He warned her repeatedly, but to no avail. Ten days ago, Pinghu celebrated Huotian's birthday with lantern displays. The woman did not inform her husband and went to the city with several female friends to see the lanterns, spending the night at the Tong'an Hotel, a brothel frequented by prostitutes. Wang learned about the matter, became filled with anger, and waited for the woman to return home. After a disagreement, he grabbed a kitchen knife and hacked at her head. The woman was seriously injured and ran away. Wang chased after her and jumped into the river in an attempt to end his life. He was rescued ashore by onlookers. Then, he went to the Siming Public Office and hanged himself. His wife fled to the front of the Jiuda Candle Shop and fell to the ground.

<h3>Changning and Zhenning Gunboats Launched Yesterday, Internal Equipment Installation Will Take Two More Months</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department built ten coastal defense gunboats with the 寗 *ning* character, and yesterday (the 14th) at 2:00 p.m., on the occasion of the completion of the hull of the last two ships, Changning and Zhenning, a launching ceremony was specifically held at the riverbank on the west side of the Gaochang Temple Shipyard, where the two ships were originally built. The grand occasion of the launch is described below:</p>
<h3>Arrangement Situation</h3>
<p>The arrangement of the stage for the launch of the two gunboats yesterday was no different from the past. The stage was located at the head of the two gunboats, with the stage shaped like a concave character, about six feet high, about three *zhang* long, and about seven *chi* wide. The two concave sides of the stage were close to the bows of the two gunboats. The stage was surrounded by wooden railings, decorated with national flags of all countries. The center of the concave part was hung with the Premier's portrait, the Party and National flags, and the Premier's will. There was a ladder to the east of the stage, and security guards were stationed at the entrance.</p>
<h3>Structure of the Two Gunboats</h3>
<p>The structural style and color scheme of the two gunboats are the same as the previous eight. The hull is gray with a red bottom and white stripes inlaid along the edges. The name of the boat is painted in gold on both sides of the bow. The displacement of the two gunboats is 300 tons, with a length of 140 feet, a width of 20 feet, a depth of 10 feet 5 inches, a draft of 6 feet, and a speed of 12 nautical miles per hour. Each bow is tied with a colorful silk tassel, with a bottle of champagne tied at the end. Each iron pole in the boat is</p>
<p>hung with the national flag, and the national flags of all countries hang at both ends.</p>
<h3>Participating Representatives</h3>
<p>When the two gunboats were launched yesterday, the Minister of the Navy, Chen Shaokuan, could not attend because he was in Nanjing on official business. Chen Jiliang, Vice Minister of Navy and Commander of the First Fleet, presided. Those who came to the venue to observe included Li Baochu, Staff Officer of the First Fleet Command, Chen Hanfan, Deputy Director of Jiangnan Shipyard, Wu Zhennan, Director of Coastal Defense, Sa Shi Houjun, Captain of the Chutai Ship stationed in Shanghai, Qiu Shizhongliang, Captain of the Yixian Ship, Zheng Yuan, Captain of the Dingan Ship, Zhang Rizhang, Captain of the Jiangzhen Ship, and officers and soldiers from various ships, representatives from various agencies, totaling about 300 people.</p>
<h3>Launching as Scheduled</h3>
<p>At 2:00 p.m., after the representatives who participated in the ceremony arrived at the venue, the workers began to dismantle the supporting wood at the bottom of the boat. First, Lin, the third mate of the Yixian ship, smashed the bow of the Changning ship with champagne. Amidst the applause of the crowd, Changning slid into the river from the bottom of the wooden support frame. A quarter of an hour later, Ni Xiling, the third mate of the Chushou ship, launched Zhenning as scheduled. The ceremony ended at 3:00 p.m. After launching the two gunboats, the installation of internal machinery and the installation of two three-inch caliber steel cannons and four machine guns that must be equipped in the front, back, left, and right will require two months to complete.</p>
<h3>Commemorative Photography</h3>
<p>In addition, the Jiangnan Shipyard, in order to entertain the representatives of various agencies who attended the ceremony, took a photo on the stage after the launch of the two gunboats as a commemorative record and prepared refreshments in the auditorium of the shipyard to treat the guests.</p>
<h3>Kung Hsiang-hsi Arrives in Shanghai and Speaks: Chiang Kai-shek Will Return to Nanjing Soon, Ministry of Finance Adds Customs Posts to Strictly Investigate Smuggling, Huang Fu Is About to Go North to Preside Over Political Affairs</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kung Hsiang-hsi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, left Nanjing by night train last night and arrived in Shanghai at 7:20 a.m. yesterday morning. He went directly to his private residence on West Aixiams Road to rest. He met with reporters at 10:30 a.m. and went to the Central Bank at 11:00 a.m. to work. Kung's remarks are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Will Return to Nanjing Today or Tomorrow</h3>
<p>According to Kung, Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>is scheduled to leave Jiangxi today or tomorrow, take a warship, and return to Nanjing by waterway to attend the tenth anniversary celebration of the Central Military Academy. As for whether he will go to Hangzhou, I have not heard of it.</p>
<h3>Adding Customs Posts to Strictly Investigate Smuggling</h3>
<p>Since the September 18 Incident, the Dalian Customs has ceased to exist, and Dalian has become a tax-free port. Imported goods are transported from Dalian to the Northeast and then distributed to various parts of North China for dumping. Or they are loaded on sailing ships in Dalian and transported to Shandong, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces. The annual losses from smuggling are nearly 20 to 30 million. The Ministry of Finance has now added customs posts at various passes along the Great Wall and in Shandong, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces to strictly investigate smuggling. It has also ordered twelve gunboats from the Jiangnan Shipyard to patrol the coastal ports and investigate smuggling. Six of these have been completed, and the remaining six will be completed one after another before July. In order to strictly investigate tax evasion from postal packages, the Ministry of Finance has specifically added package inspectors in Jiangwan, Zhoujiazhen, and other places to prevent smuggling.</p>
<h3>Huang Yingbai Is About to Go North</h3>
<p>I previously met with Huang Yingbai, who decided to rest in Shanghai for a while and then go north to preside over political affairs in North China. There is absolutely no intention of being passive. As for whether he will go to Nanjing in the next few days to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, he did not mention it.</p>

<h3>United States Passes Silver Bill: Local Banking Circles Pay Close Attention; Silver Export Surplus Remarkably Alarming</h3>
<p>The U.S. Silver Purchase Act has now been formally passed. The U.S. Treasury Department will immediately implement the purchase of large quantities of silver as reserves. This has caused serious concern in local banking circles. *Shen Shi Bao* reporters have interviewed various leaders in the financial world in recent days. The information obtained is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Impact of Silver Bill Passage on China</h3>
<p>According to economic expert Mr. Jin Guobao, the current manager of the Bank of Communications, the U.S. Silver Purchase Act was passed on the 12th of this month. The passage of this act will inevitably affect China's finance and other aspects. According to the purpose of the act, the U.S. government may purchase silver at a market price not exceeding 50 cents per ounce. The maximum purchase amount can be up to 25% of the current total reserve amount, or one-quarter. In other words, the ratio of silver to gold can be one to three. Currently, the U.S. gold reserve is approximately 7 billion yuan. If silver accounts for one-third, it would be equivalent to more than 2 billion yuan. Although the amount of silver purchased by the U.S. government recently is unknown, the U.S. government has stated that the silver reserve is still less than 15% of the total amount. From this, it can be inferred that there is still a 10% difference from the maximum limit. The silver content of silver dollars is specified as 371.25 grains, so each ounce is equal to 1.29 yuan. More than 2 billion yuan of silver, converted at 1.29 yuan per ounce, is equivalent to approximately 2 billion ounces. Therefore, calculated proportionally, at least 700 million ounces can still be purchased. As a result, China's limited silver reserves will inevitably be gradually absorbed.</p>
<h3>China's Currency Will Likely Tighten</h3>
<p>The 700 million ounces of silver that the United States needs to purchase to supplement its reserves, calculated at a market price of 50 cents, amounts to approximately</p>
<p>US$150 million. The current silver price in New York is over 45 cents. In the future, it may increase to 50 cents. If this becomes a reality, China's silver exports will increase further, and prices will inevitably fall accordingly. In 1932, China's silver exports still had a surplus of more than 38 million yuan. However, last year, due to the increase in foreign silver prices, exports were higher and imports were lower. After offsetting the exports and imports, the silver export surplus reached more than 14 million yuan. This year, from January to April, the export surplus has surprisingly reached more than 14 million yuan. Recently, the Shanghai silver price and the U.S. price have reached a state of equilibrium. If it is raised again, the contraction of China's currency will be even more severe, and prices will inevitably fall further. The continuous decline in the price index compiled by the National Tariff Commission and the agricultural product index compiled by the Shanghai Social and Economic Research Institute can serve as proof of this.</p>
<h3>Small Impact of Profit Tax</h3>
<p>Regarding the 50% profit tax attached to the passage of the U.S. Silver Purchase Act, local banking circles believe that this will not have much impact on China. It will only slightly moderate the extent of the surge in silver prices and prevent speculation by silver buyers and sellers. Therefore, during the suspension of silver trading in Shanghai and Hong Kong, there has been no significant impact. As for the recent rumors that HSBC has shipped out a large amount of silver, according to *Shen Shi Bao* reporters, this silver includes 10 million yuan in silver coins and 250,000 taels of silver bars. In March, 14 million taels of silver were also shipped out. Their destinations are Hong Kong and India. Part of it is indeed being transshipped to the puppet state for minting new coins.</p>
<h3>Startling Silver Trade Surplus</h3>
<p>According to the Bank of China's announcement yesterday, the net surplus of silver exports over imports for the past four months of this year has reached 13,680,592 yuan, which is the highest record of silver export surplus in history. The total import amount for the four months was 1,485,240 yuan in silver coins and 3,268,574 yuan in raw silver, totaling 4,753,814 yuan. The total export amount was 3,585,250 yuan in silver coins and 14,849,156 yuan in raw silver, totaling 18,434,406 yuan. The net surplus of exports over imports, amounting to 13,680,592 yuan, is remarkably alarming.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Fifth General Meeting: Proposal Review Completed; Total of 33 Member Proposals; 27 Proposals Submitted to the General Meeting for Discussion</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to hold a general meeting of member representatives at 1:00 PM on the 17th. Registered representatives are very enthusiastic. It is heard that many proposals have been received from members and have been reviewed at a convened proposal review meeting. The agenda has been arranged and is ready for discussion at the general meeting. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Review Meeting</h3>
<p>The association convened the first Proposal Review Committee meeting on the 8th of this month. Fang Jiaobo, Yu Zuoting, Pan Xusheng, Chen Zheqing, Zhu Wenqi, Bei Songsun, Zheng Zenan, and others were present. On the 13th, the second Proposal Review Committee meeting was convened. Zhu Wenqi, Yu Zuoting, Pan Xusheng, Zheng Zenan, Fang Jiaobo, and others were present. The members' proposals were reviewed one by one, and categorized into (1) those to be amended in accordance with the proposal by the general meeting; (2) those to be discussed by the general meeting; (3) those for which the general meeting is requested to approve the principles, with detailed methods to be discussed and handled by the next executive committee; (4) those with slightly revised opinions to be submitted to the general meeting for approval; (5) those to be handled by the association first without submitting to the general meeting; (6) those to be replied to</p>
<p>the original proposer as unsuitable for discussion.</p>
<h3>After Finding Kuramoto, Japanese Consulate Expresses Gratitude to China; Telegraphic Instruction to Suma Expresses Gratitude to Us; Dr. Matsui Entered Beijing Last Night to Examine Him</h3>
<p>According to China East News Agency, after the whereabouts of Consul Kuramoto were found by the capital authorities the day before yesterday, the Japanese consulate in Shanghai received a report the day before yesterday afternoon. It immediately dispatched Secretary Kawai and Asahina, accompanied by Katsufuyu Matsui of Fumin Hospital and a female nurse from the hospital, to Beijing by express train last night to carry out examination procedures. Yesterday morning, Iwai Eiichi, a spokesman for the Japanese consulate, said that the Japanese consulate was deeply grateful for the efforts of the Chinese authorities and had instructed Suma, the consul general in Beijing, to express his gratitude to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese newspaper *Mainichi Shimbun* yesterday, the Kuramoto Deputy Consul case, which was about to lead to a major international problem, took a sudden turn and turned into an international farce. However, after Kuramoto's survival, he told the Chinese side that he had "the intention of seeking death." The motive for his desire to seek death was said to be his misfortune in life. However, after his disappearance, he went out of the cave on Zijin Mountain several times, went to the teahouse in front of Xiaoling, or ate Chinese melon seeds and pastries, or sipped Chinese tea to quench his thirst. From this point of view, he obviously did not have the determination to commit suicide at first. In terms of mental state, on the evening of the 8th, he climbed Zijin Mountain, looked at the brightly lit Nanjing city from afar, and heard the sound of beasts. He first took off his clothes, was eaten clean by wolves, and did not want to leave traces. On the second night, he climbed trees like an ape, etc., which is presumed to be the result of mental confusion. However, the clothing found on the 13th was missing a straw hat. The buttons and tie were also no different from ordinary people. However, after six days of hunger, his cheeks were slightly thinner, and his beard was also longer. He still showed an elegant attitude. When Consul General Suma and Secretary Arino helped him out of the gate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he suddenly showed a look of grief and emotion. After returning to the Consulate General, he refused all visitors and lived in seclusion in a room in the consulate. Looking at the whole incident, Kuramoto, as a diplomat over the age of forty, can be presumed to lack common sense, but his actions are beyond the imagination of ordinary people.</p>
<h3>Contents of Proposals</h3>
<p>The total number of proposals from members is 33, of which 3 are handled by the association first, 3 are unsuitable for submission, and the remaining 27 are submitted to the General Meeting for discussion. Among them, 6 are about merchant group organizations, 2 are about commercial laws, 4 are about promoting domestic goods, 12 are about increasing merchant benefits, 1 is about rescuing urban industrial decline, 1 is about social economy, and 1 is about national defense construction.</p>
<h3>Executive Committee Proposals</h3>
<p>In addition to the members' proposals, there are 9 proposals submitted by the Executive Committee as follows: (1) the final account proposal for the 12th year; (2) the proposal to amend the fiscal year; (3) the budget proposal for the 23rd year; (4) the proposal to add the Eight Guilds for each industry; (5) the proposal to establish a branch office in Nanshi;</p>
<p>Proposal (6) to commend the paper industry and copper and iron machinery guilds for their efforts to implement the resolutions of the General Meeting; (7) to continue to strive for the abolition of the ham and cured meat inspection; (8) to deal with members who have been in arrears with membership fees for more than two years; (9) to strive for joint and several liability for partnership debts. In addition, there is a proposal from Executive Committee member Wang Yansong, requesting the Legislative Yuan to amend the Chamber of Commerce Law to increase the number of executive and supervisory committee members of the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation and the Independent City Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Overview of Important Cases</h3>
<p>(1) The Eight Guilds should be added to each industry. Article 7 of the Guild Law for each industry only has the regulation that they should join, but there is no way to enforce non-joining. The association has requested the Legislative Yuan to further specify the regulations, but the request has been rejected by the Yuan. It has requested the Ministry of Industry to supplement the implementation regulations, but the Ministry has replied that the law does not grant this power and it is difficult to comply. It has requested to follow the method proposed by the Beijing Municipal Party Department Social Affairs Bureau to authorize the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Those who resist joining the guild will be punished in accordance with the Administrative Execution Law and their business licenses will be revoked. The Ministry has replied that the Beijing Municipal method has been rejected as inconsistent with the law. For two years, the exchange of documents for this matter has almost filled an inch, but the result can be summed up in a few words: nothing can be done. Should the General Meeting make a resolution again, jointly present a petition to the Yuan and Ministry by the guilds of each industry, and determine the method of sanction for non-membership should be decided by the General Meeting (2) To commend the paper industry and copper and iron machinery guilds for their efforts to implement the resolutions of the General Meeting, the 3rd General Meeting of Members of the Association once resolved that the task of the Association from now on will be to concentrate on promoting domestic goods. Whether this policy can be promoted and benefit to the fullest extent depends entirely on the guilds' ability to act with enthusiasm and perseverance. For the past two years, the inspection and investigation of the situation has shown that only these two guilds are most able to work hard and bear complaints in the investigation, accusation, public discussion, and punishment of various matters, and take the implementation of the resolution as the premise everywhere, which is truly rare. It is proposed to send a letter of commendation in the name of the General Meeting to encourage them. Is it appropriate? Should the General Meeting make a resolution, (3) Cured meat inspection case, this matter started in July 1932, and was organized by the Municipal Health Bureau. The two industries believed that this type of goods did not need to be inspected, and the Executive Yuan approved the revocation on December 31 of that year. However, the municipal authorities still tried to submit to the Executive Yuan for approval to overturn the previous case and decided to continue the inspection on April 1, 1933. The inspection fee was set at 30 cents per 100 catties. The association also stated that in accordance with the law, commodity inspection should be organized by the Ministry of Industry, and the fee should not exceed 3/1000 of the commodity price. The Municipal Health Bureau usurped the power of the Ministry and the fee exceeded the legal amount. It strongly requested the revocation and sent personnel to Beijing to petition. The result was only that the inspection fee was changed to 10 cents per 100 catties, and the limit of inspection power was said that the Yuan had approved it to be handled temporarily by the Municipality before the Ministry organized this inspection. Since then, although there have been repeated telegraphic disputes that the commodity inspection law does not have the regulation that it can be temporarily approved by the Municipality before the Ministry organizes it, the Executive Yuan has also been unable to change the law by order. Repeatedly based on this, it has been submitted to strive for it, but the Yuan and Ministry have ignored it. This is the biggest outstanding case during the term of office. Should the General Meeting designate representatives to continue to strive for the abolition from the authorities? Should the General Meeting make a resolution?</p>

<h3>Cooperation of Northern Shipping Companies: Alliance of 18 Companies; Implemented Starting from the 17th; Freight Rates for Grain to Be Increased First</h3>
<p>There are many ships and low prices on the northern route. Due to competition among the shipping companies, prices have fallen, especially the freight rates for flour and grain, which have fallen to the lowest level. This time, the Tianjin Shipping Company has united with 16 shipping companies on the same route, including Hua Ning, Yong An, Zhao Xing, Zhi Dong, Hai Chang, Bei Fang, Da Tong, Yuan Da Zheng Ji, He Feng, San Bei, Hui Tong, Yuan Xing, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Swire, and Jardine Matheson, to form a grand alliance for the cooperation of northern shipping, in order to unify freight rates, eliminate the disturbance of price competition, and avoid mutual destruction. With the unanimous agreement of the 16 companies, each sent a responsible representative to convene a meeting at the local Shipping Association to discuss the alliance plan. More than a dozen meetings were held successively, and northern customs brokers were invited to publicly negotiate. It was not until yesterday that it came to an end.</p>
<h3>Grain Freight Rates Discussed First</h3>
<p>The 16 representatives discussed repeatedly and decided to first publicly set the freight rate for grain transported from Shanghai to the northern ports as a standard.</p>
<p>The representatives of the customs brokers were also invited to participate in the meeting. It has now been jointly agreed that the freight rate for flour transported from Shanghai to the northern ports, which was originally 13 cents per bag, is now revised to 18 cents for non-China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships, 19 cents for China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships, and 20 cents for Swire and Jardine Matheson ships. The original rate for rice was 28 cents per dan, but it is now revised to 40 cents for non-China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships, 42 cents for China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships, and 44 cents for Swire and Jardine Matheson ships. The commission for flour is 2 cents per bag, and the commission for rice is 95%. If cash is paid for the freight, a commission of 75% will be given. As for the compensation for ship losses, it is agreed that 3 bags will be compensated for every 1,000 bags of flour, and 35 yuan will be compensated for every 1,000 bags of rice.</p>
<h3>Implementation Starts on the 17th</h3>
<p>The Northern Shipping Alliance will first appropriately increase the freight rates for grain. The freight rates for other goods will be gradually increased. It is approved that the 16 Chinese merchant marine and state-run ships will be implemented simultaneously from the 17th of this month. However, the British companies Swire and Jardine Matheson have more ships operating in the north than any Chinese merchant shipping company. Therefore, the companies decided to request them to join the alliance. Representatives from the companies have been consulting with Swire and Jardine Matheson in recent days. Yesterday, the negotiations were successful. Swire and Jardine Matheson have reluctantly agreed to the request of the Chinese shipping merchants and expressed their sympathy. However, they only agreed to try it for two weeks first. After two weeks, they will formally sign the alliance contract. It is said that the northern alliance contract of the 18 Chinese and foreign shipping companies has a total of 15 articles. The original text is relatively long and will not be recorded here.</p>
<h3>Jiang Minsheng Petitions Xu Shiying to Rescue Northeastern Refugees; Extending the End of the Relief Association and Remitting a Surplus of 50 Yuan to Shanghai for Relief</h3>
<p>Jiang Minsheng, a major general of the Northeastern Volunteer Army, in order to awaken the national compatriots quickly, unanimously support the central government, prepare for resistance to insults, and take the opportunity to investigate the situation in various places, set off from Shanghai on May 20 to tour the provinces of the hinterland. It is learned that Jiang has arrived in Hangzhou and will soon go to eastern Zhejiang. Yesterday, he sent a letter to Xu Shiying of the United Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees, requesting to continue handling the relief of Northeastern compatriots. His painstaking efforts are truly admirable. The original letter is recorded below. To Chairman Xu and all members of the United Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees:</p>
<h3>Northeastern Incident</h3>
<p>For three years now, 30 million compatriots have been slaves in fact. In order to save themselves, for the future of their descendants, to regain their personality, and for the glorious history of their ancestors and the calls of the Northeastern refugees, the Northeastern youth have to fight against the violent Japan with their lives to regain the heritage of their ancestors and rescue the suffering of the refugees. In this long-term resistance, no less than 100,000 youths have died in the artillery fire and been brutally killed by the violent Japan. The hometowns of the anti-Japanese people cannot stand, and they flee into the pass and are scattered everywhere. Fortunately, you have enthusiastically advocated relief and have received the assistance of your compatriots, so they have not become beggars. I am also one of the people who have been rescued and represent the Northeastern refugees to express my gratitude. Your efforts to save our refugees will increase the strength of the anti-Japanese forces. Once the Northeast is recovered, it will not be the strength of our anti-Japanese forces, but the strength of your leadership of the whole country</p>
<h3>Compatriot Assistance</h3>
<p>It is such glory in the history of anti-Japanese salvation in the future. Recently, I read in the newspaper that your association will end this month, and I wept bitterly after reading it. I think that in the near future, my refugees will either become beggars or be sent back to the Northeast to live the life of a slave forever, so that the people who are resisting desperately in the front cannot concentrate on resisting, reduce the strength of unity, and increase the opportunity for violent Japan to assimilate. I hope that you will continue to maintain your original intention of saving the refugees and will always be the loving mother of my refugees. We will pass on to our children and grandchildren to commemorate your merits of saving us. In order to recover the lost land, I am touring the country to promote and request 447 million compatriots to help my 30 million refugees recover the lost land, and to request all compatriots to commemorate forever. Among the 440 million compatriots, there have been 3 years of compatriots who have in fact tasted the pain of subjugation and have been brutally killed by the violent Japan. I also request all compatriots to unite</p>
<h3>Strength of Unity</h3>
<p>Concentrate their will to save the country together. I have passed through Songjiang, Jiashan, and Jiaxing, and have been deeply moved by dozens of performances with thousands of listeners. It can be seen that the people in various places have the unanimous view of resisting Japan and saving the country. I have the principle of never raising donations, relying on my own efforts, and saving the country first by saving myself. All expenses are incurred by selling anti-Japanese calligraphy and painting and Da Hua domestic goods pencils. In addition to expenses, there is still a surplus of more than 50 yuan. Now I specially remit 50 yuan to please transfer it to help the refugees. I am now in Hangzhou and will go south to the eastern Zhejiang area in the near future. I hope you will guide me from time to time and wish you well.</p>
<h3>Strike at British American Tobacco Company: Municipal Government Inquired Yesterday; Also Consulted with Various Agencies on Methods; Substantial Decision on Resolution Direction</h3>
<p>Regarding the strike at British American Tobacco, the municipal government convened both labor and management yesterday morning at 10:00 AM for inquiry and consulted with relevant agencies on methods. A substantial decision has been made regarding the direction of the resolution. Various circles in Pudong issued a joint declaration yesterday to support the British American Tobacco workers. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Convening of Inquiry</h3>
<p>Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the Municipal Government, upon the Mayor's instruction that the British American Tobacco strike should be urgently convened for a fair mediation by both parties, notified both parties the day before yesterday to send responsible representatives to attend in order to find a way to mediate. Chen Peide, Lou Jingguan, and Dong Aosheng attended as representatives of the labor side. Board members of British American Tobacco Shafie (transliteration), translator Chen Cangzhou, Tang Jianfei of the Ministry of Industry, Wu Qiding of the Ministry of Finance, Wang Diwen of the Central People's Assembly, Lu Yinchu of the Municipal Party Department, Wang Gang of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Wang Guoxian of the Public Security Bureau were all present. The meeting was held at the First Conference Room of the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM, presided over by Secretary-General Yu. After first inquiring in detail about the opinions of both parties, Chen Peide, the representative of the labor side, stood up and declared that British American Tobacco violated the laws and regulations of our government and disregarded the suffering of the workers, suddenly closing the old factory, which caused the anger of the new factory workers and caused the strike. To resolve this, the factory should be ordered to start work immediately, and the dispute can be quelled. Then Shafie, the representative of the company, replied that the factory had to close the old factory because the workers did not obey management, which greatly affected the work. Now, they are dismissed in accordance with the Factory Law, which is not inappropriate. The two sides immediately argued with each other. Secretary-General Yu first ordered the labor side to withdraw and wait for the government to handle it according to law.</p>
<h3>Further Mediation</h3>
<p>Then Secretary-General Yu invited Wu Qiding, the representative of the Ministry of Finance, Tang Jianfei of the Ministry of Industry, Wang Diwen of the Central People's Assembly, Lu Yinchu of the Municipal Party Department, Wang Gang of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Wang Guoxian of the Public Security Bureau, and continued to discuss the method in the First Conference Room. After each representative successively expressed their opinions, it is heard that a resolution direction has been drafted and both parties will be summoned again on a scheduled date for formal mediation to ensure that the strike is resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Petition to Beijing</h3>
<p>The Strike Committee learned that Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, had left Gan to go to Beijing yesterday, so it specially dispatched representatives Chen Peide, Xiao Gengsheng, Dong Aosheng, and others to go to Beijing to petition Chiang next Monday (i.e., the 18th, originally scheduled to go to Beijing today, but the date was temporarily changed due to the municipal government's second mediation). Their goals are (1) to consider the livelihood of 8,000 workers, (2) to order the factory to restore the business of the old factory, and (3) to compensate for the losses suffered by the People's Government during working hours. At the same time, they also plan to make the same petitions to the Central Party Department, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the People's Movement Committee, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and various agencies. They also plan to entertain newspaper reporters in Beijing to report the progress.</p>
<h3>Declarations from All Circles</h3>
<p>After the British American Tobacco workers went on strike, declarations of support were issued from all circles. Yesterday, the Pudong Farmers' Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the Fire Brigade, the Security Regiment, and more than a dozen other groups issued a declaration saying that it has been a whole month since British American Tobacco Company in Pudong announced the suspension of the factory. The suffering of all British American Tobacco workers is unbearable. The Pudong market has also been greatly affected indirectly. When the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer. The survival of one factory affects not only 8,000 people. If people's hearts are not yet dead, how can they allow themselves to stand by? Our associations, etc., initially believed that the company's production increased, its business developed, and its capital was strong. The sudden shutdown of the factory had no sufficient reason. Once the Party and government mediated, it would not be difficult to solve the problem. Unexpectedly, since the standoff, it has refused the mediation of the Party and government agencies, hired White Russians, and injured workers (excerpt) We hope that compatriots across the country will rise up and share the danger with the starving and drowning. Every man and woman should do their best. This is our declaration. In addition, the labor unions of the four districts and the Huai'an Association also have declarations, which will not be recorded here due to their length.</p>

<h3>Recent News from the Nanshi Rent Reduction Association: Two Landlords Agree to Reduce Rent</h3>
<p>As a result of the efforts of the Nanshi Rent Reduction Association, landlords who deeply understand righteousness have expressed their willingness to reduce rent. Recently, the association sent letters to landlords such as Lei Yunsheng and others for commercial firms such as Tongda Company and Qingshengsheng on Minguo Road. Now, landlord Wang Yueling has agreed in person to Tongda Company to reduce the rent by 20 yuan per month. Lei Yunsheng has sent representative Zhao Deru to the association to discuss, and it is generally expected that it will be resolved soon. Dozens of buildings in Taixingli, Jiangyin Street, initiated rent reduction this month. Under the leadership of the association, they consulted with Tu Peisun, the representative of landlord Taixingyi Coal Company, several times. The original letter from the landlord to the association is recorded below: To whom it may concern: I previously received the request from your association's committee members Shen Xinfu and Ni Yilu, representing tenants such as Wang Wanzhang of Taixingli, to reduce the rent. They have repeatedly stated that since the Shanghai Incident, the commercial sector has been declining and all sectors of industry and commerce have been greatly affected. Everyone's livelihood is difficult, and the burden of rent is often exhausted. Therefore, they request an appropriate reduction to ease the burden slightly. This is also true. Therefore, in response to your association's request, I have to consider the situation and adopt it to meet your expectations and maintain your emotions. The conditions proposed by our office are listed below. The original amount is 13 yuan and 3 cents per month, now the actual collection is 10 yuan. 14 yuan and 3 cents is actually collected at 11 yuan. 18 yuan and 3 cents is actually collected at 13 yuan and 5 cents. Please check and forward it. To the Shanghai Nanshi Rent Reduction Committee, the association has officially prepared a letter of thanks for the landlord's deep understanding of righteousness to commend the benevolence.</p>
<h3>West Cheng Li Housing Rent Dispute Escalates</h3>
<p>Due to the Yi Yuan Company, the owner of the Xicheng Li in the French Concession of this port, forcing all tenants to sign harsh rental contracts, causing a reaction from the tenants, although the court ruled the contract cancelled a few days ago, the landlord refused to comply with the order. Instead, the rent collector, Ling Guanqing, forced the tenants to sign harsh contracts every day and declared that if they did not sign, they would refuse to collect rent and order them to move out. The tenants believed that since the contract had been cancelled by the court, the landlord's move was a contempt of court. Therefore, they unanimously refused and the city's federation branch held a meeting of directors at the club at 8 pm yesterday and resolved the following cases: (1) Notify all tenants to refuse to sign unanimously in accordance with the court's judgment; (2) Starting this month, all rent in the area should be stored in the bank to avoid excuses from the landlord; (3) Those tenants who have been forced to sign harsh contracts should immediately file a counterclaim and entrust five lawyers, including Wu Kaisheng and Ao Kui, to be responsible for the proceedings; (4) Join the city's rent reduction association and request the landlord to automatically reduce the rent increased the year before, and warn the landlord not to force the signing of harsh contracts from now on.</p>

<h3>National Exhibition: Merchants Selling Goods Must Affix Stamps; Tax Bureau Cites Ministry of Industry Order to Request Chamber of Commerce to Advise; Manufacturers' Association Submits for Discussion at Next General Assembly</h3>
<p>The National Goods Exhibition at the Penglai Market, hosted by the China National Goods Manufacturers Association, has been open for nearly two weeks. Regarding the issue of affixing stamps to invoices for sales, the tax bureau has a record of the Ministry of Industry's order and has sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to forward the letter to advise. The Chamber of Commerce believes that this is close to oppression, but in order to quell the matter, it will submit it to the next general assembly of representatives for discussion. The reply to the Nanshi Office of the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday stated: "With reference to your letter of June 11 (the original is in the file and is exempt from full transcription), the end of the letter stated that your association and our association have the same position and should safeguard manufacturers' appeals to the tax bureau to exempt them from affixing stamps to support them. Now, according to the reply from the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau, the statements are also true. In order to eliminate disputes between each other, it seems that a proper method should be devised to take into account both legal provisions and commercial conditions, so as to avoid misunderstandings. Correspondingly, we inform you that we hope you will check and consider how to deal with it and reply. We approve this. The temporary commercial market attached to the National Exhibition is intended for participating manufacturers to promote their products and they all hold a sacrificial attitude, which is not comparable to those who do business for profit. Since the Ministry of Industry ordered all provinces and counties to hold National Exhibitions every year, the National Exhibitions held in the country have been seen many times, and petty taxes such as stamp duties have always been exempted. Regardless of the past, the recent temporary commercial market of the Capital National Goods Exhibition hosted by the National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, and the temporary commercial market of the 3rd Exhibition of the Ministry of Railways in Beiping, which is currently being held, and the temporary commercial market of the National Exhibition held by the Northwest National Goods Mobile Exhibition Group in Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Luoyang, and other ports, why not affix stamps? In this city, the National Exhibition hosted by the Municipal Social Bureau has been held for five sessions, and there has been a temporary commercial market in each session. The location is in the Penglai Market. In the spring of this year, the citizens advocated the National Goods Association to hold the temporary commercial market of the 16th Wharf Hunan National Exhibition, etc., why not affix stamps? The past events are not far away and the precedents can be verified. The bureau alone insists on our association's National Exhibition and does not hesitate to make various demands and unwarranted oppression. If it is not for ulterior motives, it is for other purposes. The intention of our association to hold the National Exhibition has been detailed in the previous letter. For the sake of appeasing the matter, your association instructed us to devise a proper method to avoid misunderstandings between the two parties. We are very grateful for your sincere feelings. Now, we approve that at the next general assembly of representatives, we will submit your opinions for discussion and report the results. We approve the previous letter. Correspondingly, we reply and hope you will check and forward it. We also hope to reply and cherish our public friendship."</p>
<h3>Aikais Soda Water Factory Visit</h3>
<p>Soda Fountain has long been popular in Europe and the United States, and is everywhere. It is still in its initial stage in China, but due to its hygiene, cleanliness, and low price, its business will soon be able to surpass fresh orange juice, etc. Upon the invitation of Manager Wu of the Hongfa Company, we took a car to the factory at No. 309, Xujiahui Road for a visit. The entire manufacturing of soda water is divided into three major parts: the water making department, the transportation department, and the machine counter department. The machine counter department has been very busy recently. The counter is as shown in the attached picture, with four glass tubes on it, filled with various fruit juices. The tubes have lids, so there is no chance for flies and dust to enter. There is also a cup washing device. By pressing the cup down slightly, a fountain of water will inject into the inside and outside of the cup, and the washing is simple and clean. The machine box has a built-in refrigerator, which can keep the soda at below 30 degrees at all times. It is also connected to an iron cylinder, which contains distilled soda. The gas is very sufficient, up to 250 pounds, and can remain unchanged for one or two weeks. The metal parts are all plated with chromium, and the rest are inlaid with white glass, which is quite beautiful and clean. The water making department has a large building, and the air and light are very sufficient. There are four large iron buckets, which contain distilled water. The water is pumped directly to another iron bucket, which is mixed with a large amount of gas and soda. Then, it goes through four different chemical reaction tubes, and all the non-drinking components of the gas are chemically removed. Then, the most amount is injected into a half-inch thick tin can for application. The transportation department is equipped with six large and small trucks and a motorcycle for maintenance. If the ice spring counters in various places need to be repaired, they can arrive within 20 minutes. The factory has 200 ice spring counters for rent, and does not charge any rent. There are such counters on all the roads in this port, and each cup is sold for only ten copper coins, which can be said to be cheap and good.</p>
<h3>Calligrapher and Painter Xu Cangyi Revises His Fee Schedule</h3>
<p>Xu Cangyi from Hangzhou County has extraordinary talent and excels in both calligraphy and painting. His regular script is calm and ancient, entering and exiting between Shanyin and Huating. His paintings focus on landscapes. He has copied many genuine works from the Yuan and Ming dynasties and later. His brushstrokes are particularly thick and full of natural interest, not falling into the mundane. Therefore, large paintings and small books are all leisurely and natural. He came to Shanghai at an early age and sold his works for several years, receiving praise from the art world. He returned to Hangzhou the year before last due to an event and stopped collecting fees for more than a year. He worked hard to achieve the best, and those who sought his works came one after another. He was too busy to respond to the work on the inkstone field. Therefore, starting from the Dragon Boat Festival this year, he revised the fee schedule to indicate restrictions. It is said that various letter and fan shops in Shanghai and Suzhou can collect fees on his behalf. His correspondence address is Tongshang Bank, Qinghefang, Hangzhou. The fee schedule will be sent upon request.</p>

<h3>Two Doctors of Shangxian Tang Women and Children's Hospital Accused; Trial Concluded; Sentencing Scheduled for the 19th</h3>
<p>Ge Chenghui and Zhu Changya, medical officers of Shangxian Tang Women and Children's Hospital on Sapo Sai Road in the French Concession, were previously sued by Shen Wenda in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District District Court for negligently causing death due to dereliction of duty, requesting that the case be investigated and prosecuted in accordance with Article 291, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law and punished with the crime they deserve. The court approved the application and summoned the parties for questioning. The details have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday afternoon, they were summoned again. According to the witness Zhong Shuzhen, at about 10 pm on the 29th of last month, Dr. Zhu Changya called me to see the situation of the pregnant woman, but I saw that the pregnant woman's temperature and pulse were both over 100 degrees. The court asked if the pregnant woman was in a dangerous state and answered that the amniotic fluid was broken and the child was in danger, but the adult was not in danger. Therefore, I discussed with Dr. Zhu to give the pregnant woman a pill to take and let her rest, and then perform surgery after the uterus was enlarged. At 11 o'clock, I left. The next day, I received another call asking me to go, but I happened to have a delivery and could not spare myself. So I specially invited Dr. Langesi to go. The court asked whether there was any certainty in terms of medical experience after the amniotic fluid of a pregnant woman was broken. The witness replied that doctors could not be sure, that God knows. However, in this position, doctors must be worried and panicked. The court also asked if the danger could be avoided if the treatment was proper. The witness replied that there were many cases where the treatment was good, but we doctors also hope that the patient will recover, etc. Another witness, Dr. Langesi, testified that on the morning of April 30, I went to the Women and Children's Hospital twice and saw that the pregnant woman's uterine opening had not been released. The court asked if there was any danger. The witness replied that he could not see it at the time. He gave her medicine to make her uterine opening enlarged. Later in the evening, he saw that the uterine opening was gradually enlarged, so he performed surgery. The court also asked if there was any danger in the ordinary case of amniotic fluid being broken. The witness replied that if the amniotic fluid was broken, it would be very difficult for doctors. Some use medicine to induce labor and some let it happen naturally. Because using medicine to induce labor, there is a deep fear of lawsuits, so it is better to let it happen naturally. Another witness, Gu Qinyu, testified that I was the head nurse at the Women and Children's Hospital. The plaintiff's wife came to the hospital to give birth and I was her nurse. However, the pregnant woman was usually very good and could eat and drink until the 29th, when she started to change, etc. The defendant Zhu Changya stated that the pregnant woman was responsible by me and Dr. Ge. Usually, listening and looking at her, she was very good. The court asked if he had ever given her medicine. The witness replied that because the pregnant woman did not have abdominal pain and there were no signs of labor, there was no need to take medicine. Ge Chenghui stated that the cause of death of the pregnant woman was postpartum hemorrhage, which was caused by Dr. Lan and Dr. Zhu performing surgery. At this point in the interrogation, the court concluded that the interrogation of the facts was completed, and ordered the debate to begin. The plaintiff's agent, Jin Xiongbo, stated that according to the witnesses, after the amniotic fluid of a pregnant woman is broken, medicine can be used to produce the child, and there is no danger to life. However, since the plaintiff's wife entered the hospital, the defendants never gave the pregnant woman medicine until the 29th, when they gave her medicine. They did not pay attention to what they should have paid attention to, causing the plaintiff's wife and children to die. It was the defendants' intentional dereliction of duty and requested that they be investigated and prosecuted according to law. Then, under the defense of the defendant's defense lawyer, Li Tangxiang, Judge Xiong Huiping announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 2 pm on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Xinxin Company Elects New Manager; Elects Secretary-General Xiao Zongjun as Manager</h3>
<p>Xinxin Co., Ltd. on Nanjing Road is the only department store completely owned by Chinese capital and registered by the National Government. In early February of this year, after the company's general manager Li Minzhou was shot and killed by the company's Sikh patrolman Zhou Zhanyuan while performing official duties, the company's board of directors elected his nephew Li Zhelun as general manager. Xie Tong, supervisor and secretary-general Xiao Zongjun, made every effort to rectify the internal affairs. In recent months, it has been completely renewed and the results have been remarkable. The business is booming. The company's board of directors made a full resolution yesterday to formally elect Xiao Zongjun as manager to assist General Manager Li Ze in developing the company's business.

<h3>Ye Shantao Case Remanded for Retrial</h3>
<p>Ye Shantao was a member of the board of directors of the Riyue Bank. After the founder Huang Chu Jiu died, the bank closed down immediately. The depositors filed a lawsuit against the shareholders and directors, requesting the court to order them to be responsible for repayment. Ye Shantao hoped to avoid debt responsibility and falsely created a letter from Huang Chu Jiu approving his resignation from the position of director and submitted it to the court as a shield for debt avoidance. Later, creditors Zhang Zhengji, Dong Longxing, Zhu Chengfei, Chen Kaifu, etc. discovered the flaw and accused Ye of the crime of forging documents in the First Special District District Court. After the trial was concluded, Ye Shantao was acquitted. The plaintiffs were not satisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. As a result of the trial, the original sentence of three months' imprisonment for Ye Shantao's crime of forging documents was revoked. However, considering that it was his first offense, a two-year suspended sentence was pronounced. The physical pain could be avoided, but his reputation was tarnished. Therefore, Ye appealed to the Supreme Court for the third instance. After the court collected the case files for review, it considered that the previous trial was not perfect and decided to remand the case to the Second Branch of the Higher Court for retrial. Yesterday afternoon was the date of the hearing. Ye Shantao was absent and submitted a request to change the date before the hearing. After deliberation between Judge Yu and Judges Zhao and Zhou, the lawyers representing the appellants were notified in court that the case was approved for postponement of the trial.</p>

<h3>Railway Department and Syndicate Sign Loan Contract for Refrigeration Equipment to Ensure Safety of Fresh Goods; All Income from Five-Route Fresh Transport is Guaranteed</h3>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, in order to develop railway business and ensure the safety of refrigerated goods, the Ministry of Railways and the Shanghai banking community have established a 1.5 million yuan refrigeration equipment loan. The contract was formally signed yesterday, and the payments will be allocated successively. Shenshi News Agency reporters explored the details of the establishment of this loan as follows:</p>
<h3>Refrigeration Equipment</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways transports various refrigerated goods, such as fresh fish, fruits, meat, eggs, and vegetables. Every summer, they cannot be transported long distances, and they cannot be stored after being transported to the station. As a result, customers can only sell their goods upon arrival, with no room for flexibility. The losses of the customers are very large. Now, the Ministry of Railways has decided to add 40 ice cars to the Longhai, Jinpu, Pinghan, Jinghu, and Huhang lines, with a load of 600 tons, attached to various trains, specializing in the transportation of various refrigerated goods, and purchase 10 automatic ice-making cars, with a load of about 600 tons. Each car is equipped with ice-making machines to manufacture ice cubes and travel back and forth with the car to meet the needs of the ice cars, so as to ensure safety during transportation. In addition, refrigeration warehouses will be built in Nanjing, Xuzhou, Beiping, and Hangzhou to serve as distribution points for refrigerated goods to facilitate customers to temporarily store them for a long time and load and unload them at any time.</p>

<h3>This City's Hygiene Campaign to Begin; Large Urban Areas to be Held in Districts for a Fixed Period of Seven Days; Celebrities Broadcast Special Issues to Awaken the Public</h3>
<p>Since the 13th Hygiene Campaign in this city was actively prepared by the Health Department, various arrangements and all plans have been completed successively. It will be held for a week starting on the 19th of this month, and Mayor Wu has been hired as the president of the conference. According to the details released by the office yesterday, they are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Preparations Completed</h3>
<p>The preparation and organization of the 13th Hygiene Campaign began on May 4 when the Municipal Health Bureau convened representatives from the Youth Association, the Women's Youth Association, and the China Children's Welfare Association to hold the first preparatory meeting. Subsequently, the representatives considered the scattered social organization and felt that the urban life was getting worse day by day. This year's hygiene campaign aims to awaken the public and make them aware that protecting life is to enrich the strength of the nation, and that spiritual unity must be preceded by mutual material assistance.

<h3>Center and Significance of the Campaign</h3>
<p>The center of this hygiene campaign is divided into five types: spitting must be done in a safe place, urination must be done in the toilet, receiving epidemic prevention injections, garbage must be dumped in the trash can, and drinking water must be boiled. The reason is that small evils such as spitting everywhere, urinating, and dumping garbage without correction can also lead to great disasters, and small good deeds due to the above five items have a great impact on the country and the nation. Hu Changqia, representative of the Health Bureau, said yesterday that the significance of this hygiene campaign is that the rise of the country has its own origin, and the auspicious signs are often in the people. Any campaign has its own individual function, and the development of the nation has its only goal. The colleagues are holding a hygiene campaign. During this campaign, the sincere cooperation of the people is needed, and the sweet prayers deeply hope that our people will work together in the campaign, and the latter will be endless.</p>
<h3>Regular Weekly Session Starting on the 19th</h3>
<p>The 13th Hygiene Movement Congress is scheduled to begin on the 19th of this month. Mayor Wu will serve as the chairman, and the work of each group has been properly assigned. At that time, each will perform their duties to ensure that the public understands the importance of protecting life. However, due to the vast area of ​​this city, the office of the Congress has decided to arrange dates for district-by-district sessions. The Congress is scheduled for seven days, from the 19th to the 26th of this month. Special attention will be paid to civilian hygiene. The publicity methods are roughly three types: (1) Posting hygiene movement slogans and pictures along the streets; (2) Contacting various newspapers to take turns publishing special issues of the Congress from the start date of the movement; (3) Yesterday, the Congress sent letters to prominent figures from all walks of life, inviting them to speak on major radio stations, in order to awaken the public's attention to the importance of hygiene.</p>
<p>The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, each for 250,000 yuan, totaling 1.5 million yuan, was completed by Railway Minister Gu Mengyu and Shanghai Bank's Zou Bingwen, representing Chen Guangfu, contacting various banks. The contract was signed separately yesterday. The main terms are: (1) Monthly interest of 9 per mille; (2) Loan term of six years, with interest paid in the first two years, and principal and interest repaid from the third year until the sixth year, when it is fully repaid; (3) The total income from frozen and fresh goods is used as collateral. According to statistics, the total income from fresh transportation on all five lines was 1.1 million yuan last year. After the loan is successfully obtained and the equipment is improved, the income is expected to increase by one-third, reaching 1.5 million yuan. Therefore, this income forecast is used as a guarantee fund, which is extremely reliable.</p>
<h3>White River Suddenly Silted Up, Tianjin Ships Only Reach Tanggu, White River Water 11 Feet Since the 13th, Shanghai Shipping Companies Discuss Freight Rates</h3>
<p>Since the 13th, the Tianjin White River has been silted up due to sand and mud from the Yongding River and other places upstream being washed down with the water. The river water has therefore sharply decreased, dropping from 17 feet to 11 feet. Merchant ships traveling to and from the Tianjin Zizhulin area, which have deeper drafts and heavier loads, have been completely blocked again since the 13th and cannot enter the White River. They have had to temporarily anchor at Tanggu Port, and goods and passengers are transported to Tianjin for loading and unloading by barges. Yesterday, various shipping companies in this port received an urgent telegram report from Tianjin. The shipping companies have already raised this for discussion yesterday. The water freight for goods shipped to Tianjin is already extremely low. Now that the White River is silted up again, the goods must be transported by barges, and the shipping companies must increase the barging labor, which costs at least 70 or 80 cents per ton. After negotiation, it is proposed to add 7 cents per dan to the freight for goods shipped to Tianjin to cover the White River silting barging fee, in order to maintain costs. However, the British merchants believe that this time the silting of the White River is different from the situation of water reduction in winter. The water level may rise again in a few days, and normal navigation may resume. The increase of the barging fee has been temporarily suspended. Therefore, the shipping companies are still waiting and watching, and they need to observe the water level of the White River before deciding whether to increase the barging fee.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Exemption of Rubber Export Tax and Exemption of Transit Tax for Domestic Sales</h3>
<p>Regarding the request from rubber merchants in various places to the Ministry of Finance to exempt rubber export tax and increase rubber import tax in order to revitalize foreign trade, the Ministry of Finance has instructed the National Tariff Commission to reply that imported rubber is a raw material for the rubber product manufacturing industry. The import tax rate is 10% ad valorem. The rubber produced in Qiongyai only accounts for about 3.6% of the total import tax, which is not enough to meet domestic needs. Moreover, the current business operations of the domestic rubber manufacturing industry are extremely depressed. If the raw material tax rate is increased again, it will have a significant impact. Regarding the increase of rubber import tax, after careful investigation of the customs records, there were no rubber exports in the years 1921 and 1922 of the Republic of China. If it is allowed to be exported abroad tax-free, it will be sufficient to revitalize its foreign trade. However, in recent years, the world's rubber production has been oversupplied. Even if China's rubber is exported abroad tax-free, it may not be able to compete with foreign rubber sales. However, in order to effectively provide relief to this product, all export taxes payable for rubber produced in Qiongyai and shipped abroad and transit taxes payable for sales in the country have been specially exempted.</p>
<h3>Robberies Occurred in Three Places: Nanshi, Zhabei, and Western Shanghai, Security Team Members Bravely Seized Guns and Were Injured, Robbers Impersonated Communist Arresters and Gambling Arresters</h3>
<p>Zhang Jingchen, a member of the third team of the Shanghai South District Security Team and a native of Yancheng, opened the Jincheng Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 19, Lingjia Residence, No. 543, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Nanshi, and the Dahua Tea Garden at No. 20 next door in July last year. The business was fairly good. Zhang's wife, Tang, had a son and a daughter, both of whom lived in the cigarette paper shop. At 4:30 a.m. yesterday, six robbers, four of whom spoke with a northern accent and wore blue cloth short shirts, and two of whom wore white cloth short shirts and black short shirts, entered Zhang's house through the back of the lavatory, claiming to arrest gamblers. They rushed into Zhang's bedroom and searched for silver dollars worth nine yuan on Zhang's body and a pair of gold earrings from Zhang's wife, Tang. When the robbers continued to rob the leather suitcase, Zhang bravely stepped forward to snatch the robbers' guns and held them tightly. Two robbers saw this and started to fight him. As a result, Zhang was outnumbered and was seriously injured on the top of his head, right corner, left face, eye, back, and right arm. The middle finger of his right hand was also bitten. However, he seized a live ammunition gun. Just as they were struggling with each other, Zhang shouted for help. Yang Shanhui, a barber from the nearby Yuji Barber Shop, happened to return to the shop after defecating in the nearby wasteland. He was spotted by a robber guarding the door and was dragged into the tea house to be watched. When Yang heard Zhang shouting for help, he knew it was a robbery and also shouted for help. The robbers were in a hurry and abandoned the gun and hat, and fled with the loot. Police officers from the Second District arrived at the scene after hearing the news and took the stolen goods back to the district for filing. The injured person was sent to Bethel Hospital for treatment. Although the injuries were serious, they were not life-threatening. Also, Wang Yizhang's home at No. 15, Rongshen Lane, Mongolia Road, Zhabei, was also broken into by three robbers wearing suits and white pongee at 9:50 a.m. yesterday. They broke in through the back door and claimed to the owner, Wang Yizhang, that there were reactionaries upstairs and they were there to arrest them. Wang asked which agency they were from. The robbers replied that they were detectives from the Nanshi Public Security Bureau's detective team. They held guns and rushed upstairs, searching the drawers of the dressing table in the room and taking 300 silver dollars. After the robbers got the loot, they swaggered away. Afterwards, Wang Yizhang reported the situation to the Fourth District Police Station and asked them to investigate and arrest the robbers. The police station reported the case and ordered the police detectives under its jurisdiction to investigate and arrest the robbers together, and reported it to the General Bureau's Inspectorate for telephone notification to the various district teams to cooperate in the arrest and bring them to justice for interrogation. Lu Huanrong's residence at No. 249, behind Lu Xue's house near Caojiadu, Western Shanghai, was also broken into by seven robbers with different clothing at 10:45 p.m. the night before. They went to Lu's house with guns to threaten them, and one robber guarded them while the six robbers searched and looted 26 pieces of striped cloth. After the robbery, they took the loot and fled east. Afterwards, Lu reported the robbery and the lost items to the Sixth District General Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and requested an investigation. The office immediately ordered the police officers to go to the address and report it to the General Bureau for filing. It was heard that Lu Ying, the captain of the Detective Team of the Bureau, also sent a large number of detectives to investigate the robbers separately after receiving the report, and made sure to bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Xu Jinshan's Condition Worsened and He Died After Praying to the Gods, Autopsy Results Confirmed Death Due to Illness</h3>
<p>Xu Jinshan, a native of Shaoxing, is 43 years old and lives at No. 1, Yongxingfang, Qingyun Road, Zhabei. Recently, Xu contracted an illness. Yesterday morning at around 10 o'clock, he and his wife, Lu, went to the Chenghuang Temple in the city to burn incense and pray to the City God. After he finished praying, his face suddenly turned pale, his breathing became rapid, and his limbs were weak. When Lu saw this, she was shocked and quickly helped Xu into the Shenping Tea House next to the Chenghuang Temple to rest. Unexpectedly, after Xu sat down and drank a cup of tea, he felt unwell and vomited blood, and could not speak. Lu was anxious and helped him down the stairs, planning to take him to the hospital for treatment. At that time, Xu fell to the ground and could not get up. When she touched him, he had already died. She immediately cried loudly. The patrol police at the scene heard the news and came to inquire. After learning the details, they reported it to the First District, First Station. After hearing the report, Director Liu, because the person died suddenly and the cause was unknown, reported the case to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy to clarify the truth. Then, at around 3 p.m., Prosecutor Zhao, commissioned by the court, arrived at the scene with the inspectors and other personnel to perform the autopsy. They found that Xu Jinshan died of illness before his death. The body was handed over to his wife, Xu Lu, to be taken back for coffin burial, and a written guarantee was obtained for filing and future reference.</p>
<h3>Pig Head Rong Compelled a Dancer to Become a Prostitute, Forced Her to Sign a Contract Unsuccessfully, and Dared to Gather a Crowd to Commit Violence</h3>
<p>He Yueying, a woman from Baoshan who currently lives at No. 18, Renji Lane, Xinzha Road, is 21 years old this year. Her parents died early, and only her grandmother is alive. She used to be taught dancing by her adoptive mother. After completing her studies, she worked as a dancer in a dance hall in Yantai. Recently, she met a dancer, Huang Maotang, a native of the south and owner of a clothing store in Yandi Hongbang. Last month, she accompanied him to Shanghai and lived with her girlfriend, Jin Meiying, at No. 6, Zhizhong Lane, Zilaishui Street, French Concession, planning to find a livelihood in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, Zhu Rongsheng, a gangster nicknamed Pig Head Rong, who lives at No. 11, Wenyuanfang, Shaniu Company, French Concession, and his wife, Zhang Lanzhen, coveted Yueying's beauty and artistry. On the 8th of last month, Zhu and his wife invited Yueying to watch horse racing as a pretext, and lured Yueying and her girlfriend, Jin Meiying, to Room 423, Far East Hotel, Xizang Road. Two old women resembling procuresses were already waiting inside. Zhu and his wife and the two old women forced Yueying to go to Fengtian to become a prostitute, willing to pay 1,000 yuan as a dowry and asking for help. They forced her to sign a contract immediately. At that time, Yueying was shocked and did not dare to agree rashly. She replied that she would discuss it with her grandmother before making a decision, and then she was able to escape. However, the two sides broke up unhappily. The next day, Zhu rushed to No. 6, Zhizhong Lane, to inquire about Yueying's decision. Because he did not get what he wanted, he beat Yueying with his fists. On the 17th, he gathered gangsters again to cause trouble and violently beat Yueying, tearing her clothes and injuring her body. She reported it to the French Concession Police Station for investigation. When the detective was dispatched, Zhu and others were nowhere to be found. Yueying then went to Renji Hospital to examine her injuries and sought medical treatment. At the same time, she entrusted lawyer Mao Xianshen to act as her agent and filed a criminal lawsuit with the Second Special Court, accusing Zhu Rongsheng and his wife Zhu Zhang Lanying of inducing and coercing her into prostitution and harming her out of malice. She requested that they be investigated and dealt with in accordance with Article 293 of the Criminal Law on the crime of injury, and attached a civil lawsuit, seeking to recover the cost of clothes, medical expenses, and losses during the suspension of dancing, totaling 263 yuan. After receiving the complaint, the court summoned both parties yesterday. Judge Sun Pengya presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff, He Yueying, arrived at the court with her lawyer and recounted the previous situation. Only the defendant, Zhu Zhang Lanzhen, arrived at the court and claimed that her husband was in Shandong collecting wool and would be able to arrive in court in two weeks. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that, according to the plaintiff's information, the first defendant was in Shanghai and had been seen yesterday. He was not present in court because he had committed several cases in the court and was afraid of being punished. He requested that he be arrested. The court ordered a postponement to the 21st, and the plaintiff was instructed to summon Zhu Rongsheng to court for further questioning and to submit an injury examination to the medical examiner's office.</p>

<h3>Extreme Decline of the Cotton Textile Industry, The Ministry of Industry Will Discuss Relief Measures, Liu Yin Fu Prepared Five Measures, The Yarn Industry Will Also Attend the Discussion</h3>
<p>In recent years, due to the internal disturbances caused by the Communist bandits and the external oppression of powerful neighbors, all industries in our country have declined, and the rural areas have gone bankrupt. As a result, the cotton textile manufacturers, which are the largest enterprises in our country, have also shown unprecedented signs of decline due to the weak purchasing power of the people. In the autumn of last year, the Yarn Factory Industry Association resolved to reduce working hours in order to clear inventory, but it did not help. Afterwards, it petitioned the government to find ways to provide relief, but it was unable to do so due to the government's financial constraints. In the middle, the yarn manufacturers suggested issuing public bonds, but it was abandoned because there was no one to guarantee them. The yarn factory merchants believed that if they continued to delay, they would be unable to maintain operations and would all have to shut down. Therefore, they petitioned the Ministry of Industry to urgently provide relief. After receiving the petition, the Ministry of Industry sent Liu Yinfu, Director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry, to Shanghai a few days ago to investigate the current situation of the yarn industry and report back to the Ministry, and prepared five measures to implement relief, which were submitted to the Ministry for adoption. The Dagong Daily reporter learned from the yarn industry yesterday that the measures prepared by Director Liu are divided into the following five key points: (1) Increase the import tax on cotton yarn; (2) Reduce the freight for yarn and cotton; (3) Ban adulteration and water mixing of unclean cotton; (4) Prevent labor disputes from occurring, so as not to hinder the factory's business; (5) Standardize the market price of cotton yarn to stabilize the market situation. After consideration, the Ministry of Industry believes that the above points are related to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways, so it has consulted the two ministries of Finance and Railways to send personnel to the Ministry to study the matter. After the opinions of the three parties are the same, a relief meeting will be convened, at which time the yarn industry manufacturers in this city will also be invited to attend the discussion.</p>

<h3>The Public Works Bureau is Studying the Issue of Charging for Music Band Broadcasts</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau Music Band will play seven times a week this summer (previously only six times). Also, concerts will be held in Huishan Park starting this season. The entry fee for the concerts in Zhaofeng and Hongkou Parks, as proposed by the captain, is set at one yuan and five corners for the former and four corners and two corners for the latter. This proposal has been approved. As for the brass music performances, it has been decided not to set up a garden, but to store some canvas chairs, and those who rent a chair will be charged two corners to sit anywhere. A notice will be posted in front of the park gate the day before the performance, and the music program will also be posted for public knowledge. The previous proposal to set up sound circuits in the Hongkou and Bund Corps to broadcast the music in Zhaofeng Garden was investigated by the captain and found to cost at least 2,500 yuan. The Music Committee decided to discontinue it. However, for the sake of popularizing the public, the public asked the captain to plan how to broadcast so that private homes can receive the sound, and how much it would cost. As for the income of the concert itself, the public believes that the secondary problem is the primary problem of how to serve the public. The charging schedule for private invitations to the Music Band has been revised and approved by the Music Committee. However, it is the public's intention that each item in the schedule should be clearly explained and translated into Chinese, and published in the Public Works Bureau Gazette and various newspapers, and distributed to various organizations in this port and nearby Chinese officialdoms to make it known. The above sections have been approved by the Board of Directors on June 13.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>At 8:45 PM the day before yesterday, two U.S. Marines hired our company's rental car No. 1205 from 41 Nanyang Road, driven by driver Jiang Amei and accompanied by Hu Shaoying. They picked up two Western women on the way and drove to Minhang. When they returned to Shanghai after their tour, it was already 10 o'clock. It was dark and there were no lights. At that time, they suddenly saw a peasant woman carrying a load coming towards them. Jiang Amei tried to avoid her and immediately braked. However, the left side of the road was full of coal ash, and the right side was a deep ditch. The car body crashed into a large tree on the right side. Driver Jiang Amei and assistant Hu Shaoying were injured and sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The U.S. Marines and the two Western women were fortunately safe and sound, only slightly frightened. The so-called subsequent sending to a certain hospital is obviously a rumor. This matter concerns the company's reputation, and we are afraid that the rumors are inaccurate. We hope that you will correct it. Respectfully, China General Yellow Motor Company, 23.64.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently read a news report in your newspaper about a young man named Shao Weizu committing suicide by drowning himself in the sea. The report mentioned that the captain of the Sanbei Wanxiang ship found a business card with the name Shao Weizu from Shishan, Jiangsu, which was believed to be his name. Friends and relatives saw the report and came to inquire. My younger brother, Shao Weizu, is studying at Shanghai Law School and has been on sick leave at home for the past two days. The young man who drowned himself must be someone else. I am deeply concerned that friends and relatives will have more misunderstandings and make unnecessary trips. I am writing to request that your newspaper publish a statement in the clarification column to correct the record. Thank you for your public service. Sincerely, Lawyer Shao Shengzu, June 14th.</p>

<h3>The Pilotage Association Strives for Sovereignty and Refutes Fallacies (Continued) - Contribution from the Preparatory Committee of the China Pilotage Association</h3>
<p>In order to confirm this opinion, Baiyad had formal instructions at the time, which stated the following facts: The Chinese government's obligation to prevent its people from taking hostile actions against belligerent countries is usually limited to cases where the incidents occur within the jurisdiction of that country. However, the powers have extraterritorial jurisdiction over China due to treaty relations. Bai also said that this kind of legal right is also stipulated by law and cannot be arbitrarily controlled. However, its nature is not preventive but punitive. On this point, Bai cited the expanded version of American law, Section 4102, as proof. This section stipulates that anyone who intends to subvert the government of any of the above countries (referring to the countries mentioned in Section 4082, including China), incite rebellion, or plot assassination shall be guilty of a serious crime and punished with the death penalty. It also said:</p>
<p>The simple act of privately entering into a contract with any belligerent country and serving it in open war shall not be considered a crime under this section. Even if this is the case, our government does not have the proper authority to prevent it.</p>
<p>Another example is the 1932 Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai. The pilots of the Shanghai Licensed Pilotage Association brought Japanese warships into Wusong and the port of Shanghai, even though the customs authorities, representing China, had forbidden it in advance. One party held a business license issued by the customs in the name of China, while the other party clearly abused its special privileges and resisted the orders of the government that issued the business license. These people took advantage of extraterritoriality to willingly make enemies for China, such as leading Japanese warships to invade Shanghai by sea. These people were sheltered by the British flag hoisted by the Shanghai Pilotage Co., Ltd.'s pilot boat, which was registered in Hong Kong under British law. Each pilot of the association is a shareholder of the company. Therefore, in wartime, they are free to trample on China at will.</p>
<p>Regarding the conventions jointly signed by China and the world's maritime powers, the Hague Convention of 1907 on the Obligations and Rights of Neutral Countries should be noted. Article 11 of the Convention stipulates that neutral countries may allow belligerent warships entering neutral ports to hire neutral licensed pilots. The composition and application of this article are intended to maintain neutrality by using the duties of neutral pilots. In addition, there is the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea signed in 1933, which also has provisions for the duties of pilots. Therefore, if China cannot have full management authority over pilots in its ports, it will not be able to jointly fulfill its treaty obligations with the powers.</p>
<p>The above is a brief review of the status of China and the necessity of implementing new regulations for pilotage management. As for the status of the Shanghai Licensed Pilotage Association, although it has become a legal issue and actually affects China's national sovereignty, it is not satisfactory to foreign shipping companies in Shanghai. Observe the letter from the secretary of the Shanghai Foreign General Chamber of Commerce to the Shanghai Port Director on April 24, 1930, which mentioned the excessive fees charged by the pilots. The association has the unanimous answer from the three freight rate evaluation councils in this city. The members of the evaluation council all advocated that the current pilotage rates should be reduced and expressed to the pilotage association that it should be thoroughly reorganized.</p>
<p>As for the nautical qualifications of more than 40 Chinese pilot candidates in Shanghai, they are all current Chinese captains. They possess the same skills and abilities in navigation as any foreign captain. The fact that foreign marine insurance companies accept guarantees for their ships is a convincing argument. Furthermore, regarding the qualifications of foreign pilots, we can quote the words of a consul of a certain country, whose opinion can be regarded as a fair expression. Mr. Grantums, the Norwegian Consul-General in Shanghai, wrote to Mr. Keringham, the Chief Consul in Shanghai, stating that shipping companies (foreign) have pointed out that the pilots in Shanghai have the same qualifications as the</p>
<p>captains of ships sailing along the coast of China.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all new regulations governing pilotage do not prohibit foreign pilots in Shanghai from continuing to practice. Therefore, there is no reason to arouse the dissatisfaction of the Eastern Affairs Monthly. The threat to Shanghai's future security is even more unfounded. His deliberate statement is nothing more than to exclude Chinese people from serving as pilots in their territorial waters. This unfortunate and peculiar phenomenon is probably unprecedented in any country in the world. (End)</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>What Attitude Should We Use to Study Schoolwork?</h3>
<p>Not long ago, we received a letter from a university student who said that our guidance on reading was limited to store clerks and apprentices, which was inappropriate. Now, a group of people studying in schools also feel the same distress of not knowing where to start with reading. He hoped that we would also have scholarly discussions with them. Our goal is to help those who have not received formal education and want to study on their own, but we would naturally not refuse his request. Recently, we received a letter from Chen Shuyi, who felt that the school education was mechanical and the coursework was boring, which could not satisfy his desire for knowledge. Therefore, he wanted to leave school and gather a few like-minded comrades to rent a house in Hangzhou, borrow books from the Zhejiang Library every day, and read them himself. He thought that he would definitely benefit a lot from this. Based on their suggestions, we felt that it was necessary to discuss why students now adopt this attitude towards schoolwork.</p>
<p>The lack of interest in schoolwork among general students is undoubtedly due to too many shortcomings in current school education. We cannot point them out in detail here, but let's discuss a few of the most basic ones!</p>
<p>First, today's schoolwork is too mechanical. Higher education is mostly about memorizing lecture notes. People learn them from the United States and then recite those lecture notes to later generations. They may be useful in the United States, but some are simply nonsense in China. Students are not interested in receiving these undigested foods. It is not without reason that most higher education students now look down on schoolwork.</p>
<p>Second, they regard schoolwork as a chain that they can't wait to break free from. This is because the current social life is chaotic and complex, and they cannot find answers from teachers' lectures or textbooks. Textbook knowledge is just some ossified remains of knowledge. In the current stage where everything is changing rapidly and society is in a state of rapid development, practice requires every young person to understand every event in this fluid and changing process, to understand the direction of social development, and to handle practical knowledge. These cannot be obtained from textbooks or teachers' mouths. Therefore, they have completely despaired of schoolwork. Chen's reason for wanting to go to Hangzhou to study on his own is probably because of this!</p>
<p>This phenomenon is widespread. Much of the schoolwork is indeed not worth our learning. Although this is not to say that schoolwork is completely useless, it cannot be said that it is not a bankruptcy of current education. Since the things we urgently need to learn cannot be learned in schoolwork, it is not unreasonable for students to seek other ways to acquire new knowledge. A few days ago, I went to a school to see a relative and saw that his timetable had two subjects filled in one slot: Western History and Foreign Newspapers. I asked him in surprise, "Do you learn two subjects in one hour? Does the school have a foreign newspaper subject?" His answer was ingenious: "I read foreign newspapers during Western History class." Do you find it strange? It is more important to know current events than to memorize the lineage of foreign adults! Do you think it is beneficial to memorize the rise and fall of Greece and Egypt, the prosperity and decline of medieval Rome, and these historical events that are not described based on the principles of evolution? I have already read several excellent books on Western history. But my teacher hasn't read them yet. Do you think it's annoying? We read our own books in class, or simply don't go to class and sleep in the library." He also told me that the textbooks they used were extremely outdated and the content was very poor. The teachers' lectures were even more rambling and did not add much. As for social science subjects, most of them were inconsistent with reality and made people angry to listen to. We almost didn't dare to object to this. All I could do at the time was to recite a sentence comically: "Amitabha!"</p>
<p>But we do not completely deny school education, because self-study requires a basic ability first. There are many basic subjects that should still be learned in school, and these subjects cannot be neglected in the slightest. No matter what kind of research or career you like to do in the future, knowledge of various basic sciences is essential. Many people neglect these subjects because they like to read extracurricular books. This is a very serious mistake, and we definitely should not repeat their mistakes. Others, such as those who study natural sciences, should not neglect the natural science experiments in school, and they should never hinder these not perfunctory due to reading more extracurricular books. In short, we can supplement whatever schoolwork is poor, cannot appropriately meet our real lives, or is inconsistent with reality through self-study. However, we must not throw everything behind us because of choking on food, and all the basic knowledge that can be learned from school.</p>
<p>Regarding Chen's remarks about leaving school, we have the following opinions: If you are currently studying in university and have a solid foundation of basic knowledge, then we fully agree with your courage. If you are still studying in middle school, then we still hope that you do not leave school. You should still study the basic subjects hard, but you can develop the things that are not taught well in school on your own and do not have to suffer the pain of being forced to be bound by homework.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Schools to Charge Production Education Fees Next Semester</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Last year, Jiangsu provincial schools, with the approval of the provincial government, waived tuition fees to alleviate the financial burden on students' families, which greatly benefited impoverished students. The provincial government intends to maintain this policy. However, considering that most of the departments in the schools, except for normal schools, are general senior and junior high schools, and graduates may not be able to earn a living with what they have learned, it is necessary to address the backwardness of production in China by reforming secondary education. It is reported that starting next semester, production education classes will be added to enable graduates to support themselves with a skill, whether in agriculture, industry, or other fields, without having to pursue further education. The government will provide funding to support the equipment for this type of production education, and the shortfall will be covered by charging tuition fees to junior and senior high school students, but it is said that the fees will be three dollars per semester for junior high school and five dollars for senior high school, which is half of the previous tuition fees.</p>

<h3>The Director of the Anhui Education Department Returns to the Province After Inspection – Thoughts on the Education in Northern and Central Anhui</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Yang Lian, the Director of the Anhui Education Department, recently inspected education in various parts of northern and central Anhui, first in northern Anhui, then western Anhui, and then central Anhui, including Chuxian, Fengyang, Bengbu, Huaiyuan, Fuyang, Yingshang, Huoqiu, Shouxian, Liu'an, Hefei, and other places, and returned to the province on the morning of the 10th via the Zhi'an Highway. It is reported that Yang believes that education in various places has generally progressed compared to the past, and students in various schools are thrifty, hardworking, honest, and lovely. Some school sites are also excellent, such as Fengyang and Fuyang, which are very large. However, there are many shortcomings, such as: (1) Local education funding is often in dire straits, with arrears of up to eighteen months or more; (2) Those running schools lack enthusiasm; (3) Equipment is too simple; (4) There are too many local factions, with deep-seated opinions, which greatly affects the development of education; (5) Local social education is particularly backward. In the future, county heads will be responsible for rectifying local education, local education funding will be thoroughly reorganized, school equipment will be improved, and local automatic development of social education will be encouraged with government support. In the near future, it is planned to build a group of science museums throughout the province as a preliminary step in developing education.</p>

<p>National Jinan University, the highest institution of learning for overseas Chinese in the country, celebrated its 28th anniversary of founding and the 7th anniversary of the completion of the university yesterday. The school held a grand celebration. A cypress arch was erected high in front of the school gate, and festive red lanterns and green branches and leaves were hung on both sides of the road into the school, creating a very magnificent atmosphere.

Acting President Shen presided over the meeting, and Bingxun Stenography Agency recorded the proceedings. After the ceremony, President Shen delivered a speech, stating that since the establishment of the university department seven years ago, the school's affairs have developed and gradually improved. The significance of today's celebration can be divided into three points: (1) Reviewing the past, the school's moral, physical, intellectual, and group education, as well as all aspects of the situation in the past, must be carefully reviewed. Any shortcomings should be improved immediately; (2) Reflecting on the present, if there are any shortcomings in the past, they should be reflected on now to remedy them; (3) Hoping for the future, by reviewing past shortcomings and reflecting on them now, the school's affairs will definitely improve day by day in the future, and there is no doubt that practical talents will be cultivated. Next, Dong Dingsan, the Dean of the School of Business, said that he had three opinions on today's commemoration: (1) Improving teaching materials and lessons; (2) Enriching the school library; (3) Cultivating talent education and leadership education so that students can serve society and be leaders in society after graduation.</p>

It is heard that the school will follow the Ministry's order and plans to begin enrollment in August for the next semester.</p>

<p>[P Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Teachers College Serves Female Students During Summer Vacation&gt;</p>
<p>The Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Teachers College in Jiangwan, Shanghai, recognizing that female students from various regions coming to Shanghai for entrance exams during summer vacation, as well as female students from afar studying in Shanghai, often feel that this corner of Shencheng (Shanghai) lacks suitable lodging that caters to their physical and mental well-being and academic pursuit, the college, based on the principle of serving education, is willing to use its spare capacity in physical education to resolve the summer lodging problem for these female students. The college covers an area of approximately 40 mu (acres), has dormitories that can accommodate 300 people, and possesses an environment that combines urban beauty with rural tranquility. Lodging there provides opportunities to practice cycling, horseback riding, boating, piano, organ, track and field, and various ball games.

During the previous military inspection in Jiangsu Province and the current military inspection in this city, schools such as Provincial Shanghai Middle School, Xuzhou Middle School, Merchant Marine School, Tongji University, Jinan University, Datong, and Kaiming, benefited greatly by purchasing various military training equipment from the company. It is expected that it will make more contributions to scientific and military education in the future.</p>
<h3>China Child Education Society - Japan Study Tour (8) Zhou Shang</h3>
<p>At 1 p.m., we visited the Hyogo Higher Elementary School. Higher elementary schools in Japan are equivalent to junior high school in our country. The entrance qualification is graduation from a six-year ordinary elementary school. The length of study is either two or three years. This school is a two-year system. The purpose of higher elementary schools in Japan is, first, to prepare for higher education, and second, to train vocational skills so that graduates have the skills in craftsmanship to directly engage in occupations. Therefore, the school is divided into three departments: one is the general course, the second is the industrial department, and the third is the commercial department. The subjects are divided into ethics, national language (reading, spelling, writing), arithmetic, abacus, national history, geography, science, drawing, handicraft (no industrial science), singing, and physical education. In addition, the commercial department also offers commerce, bookkeeping, English, and vocational guidance. The industrial department offers commerce, learning, woodworking, metalworking, English, and vocational courses. Each department has 32 hours of instruction per week, but the amount of instruction for each subject is different.</p>
<p>The commercial and industrial departments are vocational education. Although the subjects offered are limited, the cultivation inside and outside the classroom is extremely serious, and the completeness of the equipment is breathtaking. When we visited the handicraft classroom, we almost thought we were in a factory. All kinds of machines were available. Each student should select a worksheet and fill it out on time. I asked the teacher, Mr. Muranaka, for a copy of the metalworking worksheet, and I will excerpt its contents for reference. The sheet is narrow and long, oil-printed on both sides of drawing paper, such as (1) grade, (2) name, (3) finished product, (4) amount of material, (5) production material, (6) number of operations, (7) month, day, (8) operation start time, (9) operation end time, (10) number of operation hours per day, (11) remarks, (12) total number of operation hours</p>
<p>hours minutes operation completed certification (teacher's stamp) The reverse side is (1) seat number, (2) operation number, (3) product name, (4) operation sequence, (5)</p>
<p>Operation method, (6) Machine used, (7) Tools used for each operation</p>
<p>Category, (8) Number of operation hours. The cost of such operation materials is allocated by the school every year, and students only pay 25 cents per semester. The achievements of the graduating class in production are remarkable, and the products are welcomed by society. However, when students can produce independently, they are close to graduation, so the compensation for production is limited.</p>
<p>Elementary school buildings in Japan are built with rooftop yards, which has become a common phenomenon. The rooftop facilities of the school are school gardens, and livestock and birds are raised to implement horticulture and animal husbandry education. Students automatically manage feeding animals, cultivating flowers and vegetables. Teachers guide them in fertilizer composition, pest prevention, seasonal flowers, small animal care, and other skills. Materials are provided by the school, and the proceeds from the sale of products also go to the school. On the day of our visit, the operation procedures were (1) regional beautification, (2) fertilization, (3) after-school practice sales. The school's curriculum allocation focuses on two points: both industry and commerce are integrated, so that both industry and commerce can be employed. Moreover, it can make businessmen know about industry, rather than just engaging in selling and specializing in profit-sharing. It makes workers know about business, so that they can avoid being deceived and learn about the trends of society's demand for manufactured products, so that they can improve. Such a plan is indeed commendable.</p>
<p>The school believes that elementary school is a national and social education institution, guiding the entire life of children in the process of development. See its declaration on the left:</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Records of Floating Incense</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>This edict spread very quickly in the capital; some were notified verbally by individuals, some were communicated by government offices, and some were announced in newspapers; in short, within a few hours, all officials knew about it. As for the provinces and prefectures outside the capital, they were communicated by telegram. Therefore, as long as the Empress Dowager randomly changed her mind, in less than a day, officials all over China would wear fur coats.</p>
<p>As the northwest wind blew even harder, the weather naturally became colder and colder, so the Empress Dowager continued to issue her orders: from silver squirrel to gray squirrel, then from gray squirrel to fox fur, and then from fox fur to sable. However, sable fur is not something that ordinary people can wear casually. There has long been an "unwritten" rule in the law that officials below the top two ranks are not allowed to abuse it; therefore, when the top two ranks officials wore sable fur, they still wore fox fur, no matter how rich they were, they would not dare to buy it and wear it boldly.</p>
<p>Every official and his wife paid twelve points of attention to these different clothes for the four seasons. This custom has been going on for hundreds of years, and everyone still follows it obediently. In addition to the clothes stipulated for the four seasons, there is also a special situation. For example, when spring arrives, on a certain day, the Empress Dowager's decree is issued, stating that if the weather is indeed warmer, fur clothes can of course be taken off: but if the weather is not warmer than before, and spring clothes are too cold to wear, and wearing fur clothes again is considered disobeying the decree, then a "transitional" clothing between winter clothes and spring clothes will appear. For example: suppose the weather in a certain spring is particularly cold, and it is still too cold to take off cotton or lined clothes until late spring and early summer, but according to the methods stipulated in the law, these days should already be considered summer. (58)</p>
<h3>Fashion and Bizarre Dress</h3>
<p>— Sha Yu</p>
<p>As the weather gets hotter every day, the young ladies and madams standing on the cutting edge of fashion are also gradually changing their clothes. From the arms, legs, to the neck, chest, and back, parts are exposed one by one, until everything, in thin gauze shirts like cicada wings, reveals the curves of the whole body! Curves that intoxicate the soul!</p>
<p>Clothes were originally used to protect the body. Ancient books say: "Wear Ge (a type of linen) in summer and fur in winter." However, in modern times, fashionable concepts have long overthrown the authority of the climate. A group of fashionable ladies, in the cold weather of three feet of snow, cannot find a trace of cotton on their bodies except for a fur coat; in order to be pretty, they are not afraid of being frozen to the point of squeaking, not to mention returning to nature in the summer when they don't feel cold when naked, restoring the innocence of Eve in Paradise! The true color of summer women!</p>
<p>Although the gentle breeze blows on the body, there is still some slight chill. However, the dancers at the seaside bathing ground have already put on bathing suits that expose two-thirds of their bodies, waiting for our bourgeois young masters in the quiet electric light and in the soft music. Our sweet girls are also wearing dance costumes that only cover a small part, standing on the cover of magazines, sending out sweet smiles in a daze. Yes, in the park, on the sidewalks, girls in thin gauze clothes with holes in their bodies have already been discovered, although stubborn people will shiver when they see them.</p>
<p>It is said that Chairman Chiang has decided to ban women's bizarre costumes in order to vigorously implement the New Life Movement. However, this kind of clothing with vague flesh is the new fashion from Europe and the United States in 1924. Whether it should be banned, and whether it can be banned, is still another question, which must be proven by facts!</p>
<h3>Donkey and Flower</h3>
<p>— Ji Chengxing</p>
<p>There used to be a story like this.</p>
<p>A woman had lost her left eye; but the rest of her still retained her beauty. At the same time, there was a handsome man, but his right foot was lame. Both of them had imperfect beauty, and if someone introduced them, they could possibly get together.</p>
<p>They both wanted to find a perfect living beauty. One day, the woman was sitting under the window upstairs, waiting for someone else to come to propose marriage. Her right hand was holding a bouquet of flowers, covering her left eye. Since the defect was covered by the flowers, and the flowers reflected the woman, wouldn't it become historically beautiful? So she smiled smugly.</p>
<p>The man riding on a donkey who passed by the window saw such a living beauty, and naturally went home with a spring breeze on his face, and soon asked a matchmaker to propose marriage to the woman's family. The woman was very happy to hear that the matchmaker was talking about the handsome man who rode on a donkey that day. To be honest, from that time on, they both had a good impression of each other.</p>
<p>On the wedding day, the man discovered that the woman was missing her left eye, and the woman discovered that the man was lame in his right foot.</p>
<p>"How is your left eye blind!" the man stared at the woman in shock.</p>
<p>"How is your right foot lame!" the woman also stared at the man in shock.</p>
<p>They unanimously admitted that the whole inside story was caused by the donkey and the flower. Afterwards, when the man saw the flower, he thought of his one-eyed wife; when the woman saw the donkey, she thought of her one-legged husband.</p>
<p>The donkey and the flower played such a prank!</p>

<p>A said to B, "I have been married to my wife for ten years and have never had a fight at home." B said, "This is how you can be called a virtuous couple." A said, "Because when I fight with my wife, I must go to the courtyard, so this is the principle of preserving no fighting at home."</p>
<p>An old man followed a modern girl, teasing her with frivolous words. The woman turned her head and replied, "Please discuss it with your son. If he agrees, then I dare not disobey."</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>The Thirtieth Chapter of Northeast Fourth Company Commander: Gaze Farewell to Grieving Wild Geese While Guarding the Homeland, Cicada Pierces Strong Arms, Sprinkling Blood to Dye the Isolated City</p>
<p>The brothers saw that the company commander was working so hard, so naturally, it was not convenient to stand aside and do nothing, so they followed suit and worked hard. Ziqiang hoeed for a full hour before putting down his hoe, stretching out his hand, and saying: Everyone, wait, listen to me. Everyone listened and put down their work, straightened their backs, and stood listening to Ziqiang. Ziqiang said: Brothers, don't look at my hoe, putting it down casually. Do you know that when we dig this hoe, even if it is four taels of soil, it is left to us by our ancestors. We must fight for our courage, saying that we are the descendants of our ancestors, and we must protect this piece of land and not let others snatch it away. We are soldiers, the country feeds us and clothes us. What is that for? It is to ask us to guard the land for our ancestors. Have you heard of people telling idle stories? Xue Rengui's campaign to the east, reaching the rank of Grand Marshal, and being conferred the title of Prince Pingliao by the court, he was originally from a cook. As the saying goes, generals and ministers are not born of a certain breed, and men should be self-reliant. What great things are not done by entering. Don't say that you are just a soldier and have no prospects. Who hasn't climbed up from the bottom in ancient times to do great things. This is to say it in a good way. Let's talk about it in a rogue way. If we can't guard our homeland and let the enemy occupy it, then our home is the enemy's home, our children, our ancestral graves, and even the empty clothes on our bodies may be occupied by the enemy. What's the point of a person at that time? Haven't you heard that the little devils are very powerful. If you lose your country, he can treat us Chinese as living benches. What is called a living bench? It is to call us to follow behind him. If he is tired from walking, he will let us squat down so that he can sit on our shoulders. A person who reaches that point is nothing more than a cattle and horse. (409)</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Jingwu Sent Poems from Guangdong with an Appointment to Jiao, and I was also asked to Show them, and Elder Brother Han Xiaosong Responded in Rhyme</h3>
<p>— Qian Nan</p>
<p>A letter came from Zhuhai, giving me a string of pearl sentences. Why is the postal speed so late? In the middle, it has gone through cold and heat. Is this to calm the Creator, cunningly playing tricks on purpose? Otherwise, the road is not blocked, and its essence has been changed again and again (the poem arrived twice delayed, sent in winter and arrived in summer). This made the old man greedy, thinking of thirst like a hungry worm. I guessed back and forth, and my eyes were also lifted. I quickly saw it one day, as if waiting for milk. Although there is no return to Qiongyao, I should allow myself to go. The sentences are astringent, knowing that old age has arrived, and the poems also soar, the difference is that the monks groan hard, and their shoulders soar in solitude. It is still appropriate to fulfill the return appointment, this wish is not extravagant. Support each other with canes, and do not bother the geese to come and go. Moreover, invite both of them to come, and climb the clouds and mountains wantonly, passing by the thatched cottage in the evening, and the aroma of wine spills on the lotus dew. (There is a kind of cattail grass house at the foot of Baiyun Mountain)</p>

<h3>Mattehes Dropped Speech</h3>
<p>— Shanghai News Agency</p>
<p>Public Concession Route 1 and Route 2 trams, heading west along Jing'an Temple Road, turned into Avenue Road halfway. After passing the Carter Road stop, before reaching the Gordon Road stop, the place where it stopped in the middle, diagonally opposite, was the only girls' middle school of the Public Concession Municipal Council, called Mattehes Road. This Mattehes Road has the longest name among the roads in the Public Concession, but in terms of the length of the road itself, it is just one of many short roads. Although the southern end starts from Weihaiwei Road, the section up to Jing'an Temple Road is more like a lane than a road, so it should be said that it starts from Jing'an Temple Road, and then winds twice, crossing Avenue Road, New Zha Road, and Wuding Road to the north, and ends at Connaught Road, because the opposite road is the winding Megan Road.</p>
<p>This is the road named after Mattehes.</p>
<p>If we run back from the street to the study and flip through the names of Shanghai schools, then we can find a school called Melun Middle School. This Melun Middle School was founded by the London Missionary Society of England in the 21st year before the Republic of China. It was originally called Huaying College and was located in the Maijiaquan area of Shandong Road. In the 12th year before the Republic of China, the school moved to its current address on Zhaofeng Road, and the school name was changed to Melun College. It was not until the 17th year of the Republic of China that the word "College," which lacked a clear meaning, was changed to "Middle School" in accordance with the private school regulations. However, the name of a church school is to look at its original foreign text, and the English name of the so-called Melun Middle School is only "Mattehes College."</p>
<p>Ha! Another school named after Mattehes.</p>
<p>Even if we know that Mattehes is a person's name, don't we want to ask what kind of person he is?</p>
<p>However, talking about Mattehes is inevitably in danger of entanglement. Originally, there were two foreign celebrities in Shanghai, father and son, whose surnames were indeed Mattehes (Medhiurot), and the abbreviation of their names was also the same two letters, W.H. Although because the father was a clergyman, a doctor of theology, the Western books can add the title "Doctor" when mentioning him, to distinguish him from his son who had not "seen through" so much, but they still mostly add the father's title to the son's body, or remove the father's title and turn him into the son's. To avoid entanglement, let's look at their Chinese names. The father's name is Mai Duen, and the H in his original surname is not read, and it is translated into an audion. The son's name is Mai Huatuo. Mai is of course a transliteration of the first sound of his original surname, and Huatuo is a transliteration of his Christian Name Walter.</p>
<p>These two Englishmen, father and son, are both famous "China experts". Father Mai Duen is a Christian missionary who spreads the gospel of God. After Shanghai opened its port, he carried out religious activities around Shanghai. Didn't the Qingpu incident in the 28th year of Daoguang (1848) happen, in which there was a conflict between grain boat sailors and British clergymen? As a result, because of the tiger diplomacy of the British Consul in Shanghai, Ali Guo, not only were the "perpetrators" handed over and the clergymen's losses were compensated, but also Su Song Tai Dao Wang Shaofu was transferred to another place because of this? That the three clergymen, Mai Duen was one of them. In the fourth year of Xianfeng (1854), foreigners organized the Municipal Council, and Mai Duen was one of the first directors of the Municipal Council; this was simply becoming an official, but without taking a salary.</p>
<p>The son, Mai Huatuo, not only became an official, but also took a salary. On September 17th of the 23rd year of Daoguang (November 8th, 1843), he followed Balfour, the first British Consul in Shanghai, to Shanghai, and served as an interpreter in the consulate with the qualification of a China expert. In the exchange between Xianfeng and Tongzhi, he served as the Consul in Shanghai. At the beginning of Guangxu, he returned to the post once.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to thoroughly rectify the name, we should really change the Mattehes College, which commemorates the father, to Mai Duen Middle School, and call the road that commemorates the son Mai Huatuo Road. Do you think it should be or not?</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Regarding Classical Chinese</h3>
<p>— Xu Diaoyong</p>
<p>A friend of mine is a teacher at a girls' school in Shanghai, teaching Chinese literature to senior high school students. One night, he brought a stack of student essays, saying he was too busy and wanted me to help him grade them.</p>
<p>The girls in their senior year of high school in Shanghai are at least seventeen or eighteen years old and are quite fashionable. Some must be skilled at writing love letters. With a feeling close to curiosity, I happily accepted the thirty-odd notebooks, eager to see the handwriting of these young ladies. Before opening the covers, I imagined that inside were thoughts as delicate as their figures and vocabulary as glamorous as their outfits: the writing of modern girls must be full of fresh, contemporary flavor.</p>
<p>However, it was truly "better not to have looked." After finishing the thirty notebooks, I felt an extraordinary sense of disillusionment.</p>
<p>Not one of the essays written by these thirty-odd senior high school girls had coherent sentences, and not one had a proper argument. As for the length, the longest was less than five hundred words. Despite being such short pieces, grading them was exceptionally difficult; some were simply fit to be completely crossed out.</p>
<p>What was going on? I immediately understood that it was the result of teaching classical Chinese. I went through all thirty notebooks, and every essay inside was written in incomprehensible classical Chinese. I couldn't help but feel indignant on behalf of these thirty-odd modern girls. However, I also knew that the students being harmed by classical Chinese in schools were by no means limited to these thirty-odd. The corpse of classical Chinese has "returned" to many schools and is running rampant. At the same time, many writers contributing to magazines and newspapers are also intentionally or unintentionally leaning towards classical Chinese, either writing entirely in classical Chinese or interspersing many classical Chinese phrases in their vernacular writing.</p>
<p>The above two facts are not accidental. Upon investigation, the reason for both is actually the same, lying in the current state of society. Now, a movement against classical Chinese is beginning. But if the opponents' arguments stem solely from the merits of classical Chinese versus vernacular Chinese, they will inevitably become ineffective platitudes. The first step in opposition must be to point out the social causes of the current situation. Here, I cannot explain those causes in detail. Since we are talking about female students, I will use women's foot binding as an analogy. There are probably two explanations for the origin of foot binding: one is that after women became slaves, men used various methods to restrain them, and foot binding was one such means of restraint. Since the slogan of liberation was shouted, many Chinese women have indeed kept their natural feet, but because having natural feet was ultimately too free, people put them in high-heeled shoes, so they still walked with a hobble, the same as if they were bound.</p>
<p>The second explanation, as Plekhanov said in his theory of art, is that wealthy courtesans, because they did not need to work and did not value time, deliberately restricted their walking, treating it as a seductive appearance, and deliberately displayed the opposite of the walking posture of poor women who were engaged in labor. This is the so-called "root of opposition" theory.</p>
<p>Both of these explanations are consistent with the facts, but upon closer examination, the cause is only one: the social state of a certain era. In that state, the rulers of society, in order to limit the ruled, not only restrained them, but also deliberately considered that state of restraint to be noble and beautiful, and made people willingly submit.</p>
<p>The reason why schools today teach classical Chinese is to restrain the free activity of students' thinking, and this is very effective. As for some writers, because they belong to the wealthy and leisurely class and write about the wind and the moon, their lives determine the subjects of their works, and the subjects of their works determine the forms of their works, so they love to write classical Chinese. However, there is also a category of people who know that their thinking is sharp, and expressing their thoughts directly in vernacular Chinese is likely to cause trouble, so they deliberately use classical Chinese to write, so that their thoughts are cloaked in a not-so-obvious guise to avoid being too conspicuous. Why do so many schools want to restrain students' thinking? Why are writers who sing of the wind and the moon valued? Why are some writers so afraid of trouble? I believe that there must be common social causes, but I cannot point them out in detail or clearly. Who can point them out? Pointing out the causes and making the public aware of them is the only way to prevent the movement against classical Chinese from failing.</p>
<p>Looking at the curriculum standards set by the Ministry of Education, focusing solely on classical Chinese is not allowed. Those schools that violate the laws of the Ministry of Education will be punished, and this does not need to be said. I only hope that many writers, unless it is absolutely necessary, will not intentionally use classical Chinese to write, because this is unintentionally fueling some kind of bad trend. Otherwise, the minds of future young people will become dull, and as some predict, the result of the popularity of high-heeled shoes will be that the toes of women across the country will be in a straight line with their calves.</p>
<h3>Rumors</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Whenever the situation is chaotic, absurd theories emerge endlessly. Confused people are always afraid that the sky will fall, and the psychology of the common people is even weaker. As a result, those who are manipulative create rumors, and schemers use this to incite. So, people tell each other in alarm, and then run away in fear, and then are on edge all day long, and then the situation cannot be salvaged.</p>
<p>People who are upright and honest are few, although they are the backbone of society. Theories that are upright and honest have little influence, and it is baseless talk that has power. During the European War, public opinion was still relatively valued, and at that time, the people's minds were still opening up. But no matter what, for a time, the people did not understand the reason for "participating in the war" and the reason why Germany should be defeated. At that time, science seemed to be omnipotent, so schemers created rumors that the Germans were using corpses to make oil. What did they do with the oil? They made soap!</p>
<p>In the eyes of Westerners, China's family system and ancestor worship are very alarming. After such an announcement, the Germans in our people's minds all seemed like man-eating demons, and of course there was a common obligation to condemn them. The German nation, fighting hard far away in Europe, was unknowingly wronged.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, science has continued to advance to this day, and there has never been a precedent for making soap from corpses. After the end of the European War, people gradually realized this strange injustice in history. But it had already taken effect, and explanation was meaningless.</p>
<p>Now, the world situation is tense again, and international schemers and rumor-mongers are rising like clouds, taking advantage of the public's panic to create seemingly reliable news for profit, and they are emerging endlessly. One batch is ineffective, and another batch comes, becoming more and more strange, more and more clever, and overturning the psychology of the people of an era.</p>
<p>Even in recent events, there is some country's prophet coming to China, specializing in talking about the world situation, but also telling fortunes and predicting good and bad luck. And our country's newspapers do not hesitate to do free publicity, because that prophet said that China will definitely win in the world war. Where did these swindling rogues come from? Is there public opinion from the backbone of society to attack them?</p>
<p>Alas! "Like that spring water, do not sink into ruin together." The society is making a fuss about some place where a spirit is descending, and some place where a fox demon has been discovered. This is called having no way to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Gejiu Mine (Part 1) 丨丨One of the Mining Area Communications丨丨</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>Sandwiched between two mountains, the GeBi Railway connects to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, producing a huge amount of tin every year, which is transported and sold to Hong Kong. 丨丨Gejiu is the most famous mining area in Yunnan丨丨</p>
<p>On one side, the old Yin Mountain indecently exposes itself, and on the other side, the old Yang Mountain shamelessly stands erect. Tens of thousands of houses like fish scales are built under this natural "Yin" and "Yang" In the past, this place was very chaotic. 丨丨</p>
<p>With more than two zhang of cloth wrapped around their heads, one or two dozen silver buttons on their mandarin jackets, their trouser legs rolled up to their knees, and their fingers constantly fiddling with the hair-trigger of their guns, looking very serious, these types of heroes often appeared on the streets!</p>
<p>Extortion, deception, and sometimes throwing caution to the wind and taking a desperate gamble are their heroic qualities.</p>
<p>There are also those who wear filthy muddy clothes, walking on the streets, looking like just a sand miner coming down from the mine, but when he encounters those kinds of lone heroes, he will suddenly, unexpectedly, pull out the sharp knife hidden on his body, stab them a few times, and snatch the gun.</p>
<p>Therefore, no one dares to go out at night. Wealthy bosses often wear a coarse cloth short coat during the day, wear a small melon-shaped cap, and walk on the streets very plainly. But there are also those who leisurely hold ivory pipes, wear overcoats, and are surrounded by guards in front, behind, left, and right, and no one dares to provoke them!</p>
<p>Now it is different from before. The streets are becoming more and more prosperous, and dazzling foreign goods from imperialism fill every store. Extravagant restaurants are often lively with our bosses.</p>
<p>The Tin Affairs Company, standing at the foot of the old Yin Mountain, has tall chimneys that emit black smoke day and night. This is the only modern industrial organization here. Other than this, they are all small organizations that use the old methods. Although Gejiu is a place that produces tin, the mining takes place at the mine thirty or forty li away. The mine is very large, containing extremely rich tin ore, divided into forty-eight mines, and each mine has many miners.······</p>
<p>The road to the mine is a rugged mountain road. Walking on the road, looking out, it is all bare mine mountains, and not a single lovely green tree can be seen! Looking back, Gejiu is so low.</p>
<p>At that time, I followed a "water carrier" acquaintance, carrying a load on my shoulders, and went to the mine early in the morning. The roaring gale wind howled and撲 came head-on, making it difficult for people to even breathe. Braving the cold, we walked this early morning to reach the mine. 丨丨What surprised me at first sight was the sand miners covered in mud, busily digging and carrying. Some had a gas lamp inserted in their heads, a sweat scraper clipped to their ears, and a burlap bag hanging on their shoulders. They bent over and drilled into the mine cave like mice. The mine cave was so terribly dark, and the entrance was just big enough for one person to enter. The top was supported by short chestnut wood. Some caves were more than ten li deep, and shallow ones were also four or five li deep. Inside, there were many places that were not easy to climb over. Some, when coming out of the cave, had to take off the burlap bag full of ore from their shoulders, push it forward first, and then crawl past like a snake. Some, when crawling, had to roll over when their head passed the checkpoint, and slowly crawl past 丨丨. This is called "snake shedding its skin, eagle turning over." But there are also dangerous "traps" and "hanging wells." These unfathomable traps were abandoned by predecessors who explored and mined. If you accidentally fall in, my God, a living life will be gone like that!</p>
<h3>Talking about Face</h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>If I scold you with "shameless," you will definitely feel very sad. Conversely, if I praise you with "how particular you are about face," a light, ethereal feeling of pleasure may wander in your heart.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of face, people consider it a major matter.</p>
<p>However, although "face" is regarded as a major matter, it has levels according to the class to which each person belongs. Even if you have the ability to climb up to a higher level, you will not necessarily escape the ridicule of your peers. If you fall, you are obviously encountering some accident, and as usual, people want you to maintain "face." At the very least, they will feign compassion and try their best to help you in every way. Perhaps they themselves will secretly skim some profits. Weddings and funerals are good examples. Those who have some money naturally want to spend more to win people's praise; those who are already penniless grit their teeth and make arrangements for the sake of "face," either voluntarily or at the suggestion of relatives and friends, and there are not a few of them.</p>
<p>Naturally, as mentioned above, the main determining condition for how much "face" is valued is the class to which each person belongs, the so-called economic background. Increase or decrease can be directly proportional. Therefore, in all classes, officials, politicians, and rich people must occupy an advantage in terms of the degree to which they value "face." It seems that "when clothing and food are sufficient, ritual and righteousness flourish" is indeed a good saying. However, in terms of sincerity, officials, politicians, and rich people are not necessarily at an advantage. On the contrary, they are only doing it for "socializing," trying to exchange or maintain their own status, and there is no sincerity to speak of!</p>
<p>Some people are too poor to have any gifts to "reciprocate," but if they make friends with you, they are sincere. However, if you ask them to pay attention to the so-called "face" in social interactions, not having money is precisely their difficulty!</p>
<h3>Incantation</h3>
<p>— Xu Jie</p>
<p>Just because I arrived a little late, all the people had already scattered like birds and beasts. Only the mud altar of yellow earth remained in the main hall, and the wooden planks on the ground were pasted with yellow paper. One by one, the porters carried the wooden beams, wiping their sweat and sighing. Was not each piece of wood pasted with sacred yellow paper? Why did their weight not decrease at all! The ghosts being delivered cried even more miserably,</p>
<p>The people being blessed still took dry grass as food, and only the nearby dog barks, carrying seven points of laziness, could be considered to have learned this lively incantation. 1934, 5, 23.</p>
<h3>Guiying's Dad (1)</h3>
<p>— Hua Zi</p>
<p>According to the custom in this place, for a man with children, unless there are relatives with a generational rank, they often add the word "Dad" after the name of his son or daughter to address him. This is an abbreviation of "XX's Dad." But the sound of this "Dad" is pronounced "Pan" here. His daughter's name is Guiying, so people call him "Guiying Pan."</p>
<p>This place is my wife's family's home in W County. W County is a wealthy small county in eastern Zhejiang. The two products of oranges and rice have created a prosperous market, but its West Street is very desolate and bleak. On both sides of this street are dilapidated houses, indicating that there are no wealthy families in this area. If it is not on the days of the 3rd and 9th, the number of pedestrians on the street is only one or two times more than that of stray dogs wandering for food. Every 3rd and 9th, it is very different. Villagers within eighty li outside the West Gate come to the city to attend the market. From five or six o'clock in the morning, people and loads pour into the West Gate like a tide, flow through West Street, and rush all the way to the main street at the end. Between nine and twelve o'clock, unless you are strong enough to squeeze through, you don't have to think about walking on the street, where you simply can't find a gap for one person. Around twelve o'clock, the villagers' loads are mostly empty, and their bags are filled with silver coins and copper coins that are about the same as they had planned. Those who live close and are thrifty buy what they want to buy and go back first. The majority of them find familiar small restaurants, spend a dozen copper coins to drink a bowl or two of wine, and enjoy themselves for a while.</p>
<p>My mother-in-law's small restaurant, located at the head of the West Gate, does business with these patrons on these days. On these days, the only clerk, my mother-in-law's eldest grandson, A Ren, is too busy to handle it all, so my mother-in-law has to come out in person to heat up the wine and busy herself non-stop. Sometimes, even my wife and her sister have to go downstairs to help for a while.</p>
<p>My mother-in-law divided the house for her daughters-in-law to live in, and she and her two daughters lived upstairs in the restaurant. After I married her youngest daughter, I also spent more than a month upstairs. Living up here is very lonely. My mother-in-law doesn't understand my accent and can't communicate at all. Other than my wife and her sister, there is no third person to talk to. A Ren, who manages the shop downstairs, is too busy on market days. On quiet days, there is no business, and he is always lying on the counter looking at comic books. Even if he is free, he has nothing to talk to me about. When the street is quiet, there is nothing to see, and you will get tired of standing at the door for less than five minutes. The lively days are too noisy, especially the sight of a dozen or so villagers being drunk and happy and looking like they are going to cause trouble, which frightens me.</p>

<h3>Financial News: U.S. House Approves Silver Amendment, Spot Gold Plummets 8.5 Yuan, Biddle Proposes Silver Tax Amendment, McCarran Advocates Issuing Silver Certificates</h3>
<p>The gold market plummeted yesterday due to the sudden surge in silver prices, which frightened people. In addition, the Associated Press reported that the silver bill had been amended. Prices were approaching the 10 yuan mark. Although the initial price rise was followed by a rise, it was ultimately broken because the House had approved the amendment. In the morning, overseas silver markets in England and America rose sharply, and the Gold and Silver Exchange's forward silver prices also rose by two to four percent. The exchange rate of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) dropped slightly, London gold rose by six pence, American cotton rose by one pound, and American wheat fell by 3.375. Stock prices rose and fell slightly, and people's morale turned weak. In addition, the Associated Press reported that U.S. official Biddle had proposed a silver amendment, intending to change the scope of the silver profits tax to exempt those with legitimate positions, and that McCarran had proposed issuing silver certificates. The market was further hit. Extramural preliminary transactions initially traded around 10 yuan (goods had been trading at 11 or 12 yuan). After the opening, the market was stabilized by the tighter interbank clearing. HSBC's prices for England and America remained unchanged but rose. However, banks bought near and sold far. Reuters successively reported that the Senate had passed the Tydings-McDuffie Act and other bills. Thereafter, the situation was uncertain. However, because banks were still buying U.S. dollars, the Seattle night market silver price report came in, close to the spot price, with the forward price rising by only 2.25. Despite the low price, it was still able to rise. Later, Reuters reported that the House had approved the silver amendment: (1) Biddle advocated that the silver tax be limited to refined silver bars; (2) McCarran advocated issuing silver certificates with the same status as current currency. People's morale suddenly weakened. Large firms such as Guangbang and speculator Mr. Lu all supplied silver, breaking the 10 yuan mark. However, because the Central Bank opened a spot price of 10.10 yuan, it was still able to pull up at noon. Later, the Seattle night market silver price report came in unchanged, rising by 0.75 to 2.25. After opening, it broke into the 10 yuan mark. Although there was a rebound afterwards, it was ultimately soft due to interbank dumping of U.S. dollars. Buyers were diligent, and many were in an oppressed position. Afterwards, the exchange market calmed down, and some were able to buy low and gradually see improvement. In the end, it was still able to break out of the 10 yuan mark. The market was still calm, with gold priced at 1020.4 yuan. A seven-to-eight-month swap will be held at 3:00 PM on the 15th. Here is a record of today's market conditions.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 10.104 yuan, down 8 British pounds and one shilling 3/8 from the previous close, and U.S. dollars at 33.0625. The Central Bank took U.S. dollars for September at 3.75. Goods such as Hengyu, Fuyu, Yifeng, Yongda, Xingyong, Tongyi, Yingfeng, Hengqing, and Yu successively submitted silver, rising from 10 yuan to 2.8 yuan. Fuchang, Dafa, Yongtongchun, Yuqingyong unloaded, dropping to 1.8 yuan. The Central Bank and Magali took U.S. dollars for October at 4.375. Hengyu, Tongtaichang, Yukang, Fuxing, and Yuyuqingyong submitted more silver, rising to 3.3 yuan. HSBC's prices for England and America were both flat. Mitsui cleared U.S. dollars for July at 1.25, and Magali cleared August at 2.25, stabilizing slightly. Yingfeng, Hengda, Decheng, Dingkang sold silver. The Central Bank cleared U.S. dollars for August at 2.25, dropping to around 2 yuan. Futai, Heng, Zhaofengchang sold to 1.3 yuan. Huabi took U.S. dollars for October at 0.5 yuan and then rose again. The Seattle night market silver price was unchanged. Hengyu, Yuanmao Yong, etc. came in, gradually rising to 3.3 yuan. Huixiang and Hengxing unloaded and then fell again. Reuters reported that the U.S. House had approved the silver amendment proposed by the senators. People's morale weakened greatly. Zhaofengchang, Hengxingyuandaxing, Yongxin錩, Yifengyong sold off one after another, breaking the 10 yuan mark and dropping to 9.6 yuan. The Central Bank opened a spot price of 10.10 yuan. Buyers in the market were more enthusiastic. Large firms such as Yuqingyong, Fuxingyong, and Yingfenghengfuchang worked hard to buy in, rebounding to 0.8 yuan. Shenkang supplied silver and stabilized slightly. The noon closing was 10.107 yuan, with goods at 0.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opened at 10.094 yuan, with goods opening at 9.2 yuan, due to the automatic rise of the Seattle night market silver price, rising by 0.75 and 0.25. The Central Bank bought U.S. dollars for October at 5.625. Tongtaichang submitted silver, rising from 9.3 yuan to 10.02 yuan. Subsequently, because U.S. dollars for October at 5.625 were difficult to sell, Hengyushunli goods Fuyu Honglizhaofengchang sold to 8.4 yuan. Magali took U.S. dollars for October at 6.25. Fuchang continued to buy non-stop, rising to 9.3 yuan. Hengyu, Dachang, Xiangruikang, Tianfengyong, Yuqingyong, etc. supplied silver again, dropping further to 8.3 yuan. However, at this time, Dafa Yong, Fuxingyong, and Tongtaichang took advantage of the low price to take in silver, and were still able to rebound to 8.8 yuan. Yuanchang Yong, Tianfengyong, Dadecheng, and Yuqingyong sold again, dropping again to 8.3 yuan. Hengxing, Hengyu, Tongtaichang, and Jiatai bought in one after another, rising to outside 9 yuan.

The gold price was calculated at 1020.4 yuan, about 10 yuan more. There were not many transactions in the market, and the situation was quiet, due to the swap relationship. Tianjin goods were about 11 yuan more. The Central Bank opened to take in 210 spot goods, priced at 1009 yuan and 1010 yuan, handled by Yingfengheng. The psychology of the swap peers in this session was inconsistent, and the premium was also unpredictable. The market air, the bulls had a rumor to do swap, but in this waiting for the accumulation of spot goods, the general bears were not frightened, the premium was generally advanced by the bulls by about two yuan up and down, and the trend was extremely difficult to grasp.</p>

<h3>Sluggish Commodity Trade Before the Festival, Silver and Money Industries Less Enthusiastic Than Before</h3>
<p>As each year approaches the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival, Shanghai stores prepare various necessary items to supply the market for sale. Therefore, the inflow and outflow of funds in the silver and money industries seem particularly complicated. This year, the economy of both rural and urban areas has largely declined, and the sales of frugal goods have sharply decreased, greatly diminishing the festive atmosphere. Various industries are therefore silent and inactive, and the flow of funds is also very sluggish, eventually resembling a dead market. Commercial stagnation and the financial sector having nothing to do make the listlessness of people's hearts in the market an undeniable fact. Hence, the interbank lending rate has remained stable throughout. Yesterday, the morning and afternoon markets were still at 8%, the same as the day before. The "splitting the difference" was still somewhat present in the market the day before, but yesterday it was completely absent. In the morning market for interbank bills, only 3.7 to 3.8 million was transferred, with new transactions of just over 500,000. In the afternoon market, transactions were just over 200,000. Transactions in the small general association amounted to just over 400,000. Given the current economic stagnation, there are very few new transactions in foreign collateral loans. Yesterday, over 800,000 was redeemed, while only over 600,000 was newly made. Over 800,000 in banknotes were recovered, and 1.3 to 1.4 million were issued. In addition, over 300,000 in banknotes of the China, Siming, and Central banks were transported to Ningbo, reportedly for the purpose of collecting miscellaneous grains and spring flowers. Other cash sources amounted to 300,000, with just over 100,000 transported to the Yangtze River. Banks collected and cleared drafts for foreign banks amounting to 2.7 to 2.8 million, various commodity exchange collateral miscellaneous drafts amounting to over 4.9 million, and telegraphic transfers amounting to over 600,000. It is said that losses from speculation on Chinese merchant drafts in the first half of the year were substantial, so a large amount of this settlement money was remitted. Foreign merchants released 400,000 from warehouses. Chinese merchant banks collected and cleared drafts amounting to 2.5 to 2.6 million, various commodity exchange collateral tax miscellaneous drafts amounting to 5.4 to 5.5 million, and telegraphic transfers also amounting to 700,000 to 800,000. 800,000 was brought into warehouses. Japanese banks collected and cleared drafts amounting to over 2.2 million, various commodity exchange miscellaneous drafts amounting to 4.7 to 4.8 million, and foreign exchange settlement money amounting to over 900,000. 600,000 was released from warehouses. Money shops cleared over 35 million in foreign public drafts and over 6.2 million in foreign "splitting the difference", various remittances from different routes amounted to over 500,000, and cash receipts amounted to 300,000 to 400,000. Also, the total amount exchanged by the Shanghai Clearing House on the 14th was 6,800,002.817 yuan and 8 jiao 6 fen in silver dollars, including 3,394,747.5 jiao in silver dollars and 3,400,080.070 yuan and 3 jiao 6 fen in exchange drafts.</p>
<h3>Jiang Corners Fall to 800 Yuan</h3>
<p>Due to the return of capital from various places and sluggish sales, the market price of Jiang corners has fallen sharply in recent days. In the past week, it has successively declined by as much as 30 to 40 yuan, with the sharp drop yesterday being even more severe. The morning market yesterday was 803 yuan, a sharp drop of 17 yuan compared to the morning market the day before. The afternoon market continued to decline by a small 3 yuan, reaching a bulk price of 800 yuan, a difference of as much as 20 yuan. The exhaustion of the situation cannot be overstated. Transactions were made for only 2,000 corners in the morning market and only 3,000 corners in the afternoon market. Because sellers were eager and no one dared to buy, transactions were scarce and prices plummeted. Guangdong small foreign coins were 727 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, a small 6 and a half yuan lower than the previous morning. It is said that another 70,000 to 80,000 corners have arrived. Transactions were made for 80,000 corners in the morning market and 65,000 corners in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained at 331,000 wen, with 42,368 strings traded,</p>
<p>equivalent to 12,800 yuan in substitute foreign currency.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market Trends are Particularly Strong; Afternoon Trading Only Begins at 5 PM</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, due to the recovery of the hidden capital, had already made up for most of the "floating shorts" at the close of trading the day before. Although the facts have been fully revealed, the market has not been significantly affected, as there are still many who insist on shorting. As the Lunar Dragon Boat Festival approaches, many are cashing out profits on "floating longs" to provide funds. Most of the major long positions are for arbitrage purposes, so it is expected that the amount of goods received this month will be large. The hidden capital incident is in the past, the environment is trending towards stability, and Sino-Japanese negotiations are sure to proceed more smoothly. The future should still see rising trends. Throughout yesterday, the morning opening was chaotic, with highs and lows interspersed. There was profit-taking on "floating longs" and short-covering, resulting in a complex and chaotic situation. Market prices were also uneven, with highs and lows differing by about 2 to 3 jiao. Trading was mostly selling of numbers 21 and 75, and buying of numbers 5, 36, and 37. In the second round, number 75 continued to be sold, and the market price weakened slightly by about 1 jiao. The afternoon opening was delayed until 3:15 PM due to a minority of brokers and the exchange verifying transactions, which was more than 45 minutes past the scheduled time. The brokers then requested a re-trading session, and both sides insisted until trading finally began at 5 PM. Initially, the market price continued to weaken by 1.5 jiao. During the "unified tax" trading session, buyers gradually poured in, and numbers 32 and 50 were in high demand. Number 75 had been oversold and had to be recovered, so the market price gradually rose by 5 fen, 1 jiao, and even 3 jiao. "Gold Shorts" saw a new high price of 71.95 yuan. The closing session opened at 6:30 PM. Good news in the evening papers caused prices to rise uniformly by about 1 to 2 jiao, and the trend was extremely stable. The results of the market prices showed increases ranging from 1 jiao to 6 jiao, with three or four types slightly weakening by 1 to 2 jiao. The total trading volume was estimated at around 15 million yuan. A comparative table of the increases and decreases is listed on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Initially Rises, Then Returns</h3>
<p>A report from the Sin Fung Trading Company stated that yesterday (the 13th), the New York stock market initially rose and then retreated. In the early morning, May sugar futures reached a new high since April 1930, sugar stocks surged, and silver stocks also strengthened, pushing the market higher. Later, due to a sharp decline in wheat, largely due to continued rainfall in the United States and Canada, and disappointing reports from Western Union Telegraph Company for April, transportation stocks gradually softened, and the market could not sustain the gains. As a result, the market closed slightly lower overall compared to the previous day. In the bond market, German bonds plummeted, as it is widely expected that Germany will declare a suspension of debt payments under the Dawes and Young Plans, and the mark may also be devalued. Public bonds of other countries showed mixed ups and downs, domestic bonds were slightly higher, and U.S. government bonds were stable. Although there was profit-taking on "longs" on the small exchanges, the market was relatively stable. (Securities) The market softened slightly along with wheat, but sentiment was quite strong, although trading was not active. The forecast is for the market to gradually rise. (Wheat) Woodlice appeared in the fields, an increase in profit-taking on "longs," and limit orders being automatically executed as prices fell caused the market to plummet. However, this is a good buying opportunity, as the harvest situation has not changed. Speculative attention is now focused on corn, as prices are low and it has the potential to substitute for wheat. (Cotton) The government's weekly crop report was unfavorable, but expectations of improving weather caused buying to be subdued. Traders are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. The cloth trade is still active, but spot cotton is sluggish. Speculative attention is focused on weather reports. (Rubber) The market was strong and influenced by London, and sentiment was extremely strong. (Sugar) The market was firm with lively spot demand and few sellers. Statistical positioning is quite good. The total volume of shares traded for the day was 880,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Sales Show Signs of Decline; Cotton Yarn Prices Fall Again; Yarn Trading Suspended on the 16th for the Summer Festival</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and a falling trend is emerging. Due to the sluggish sales of current yarn, some anticipate very little hope from various merchant groups after the festival, as the financial situation in various regions is too weak, and purchasing power is unlikely to fully develop. Therefore, the Guang merchant group (Wanxing Hao) is largely liquidating "long" positions, with a contract volume of 5,000 to 6,000 bales. As a result, the market surface has greatly loosened, and the market price has fallen accordingly.</p>
<h3>Gold Rooster Falls by 1.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>In the opening of the Shanghai Yarn Exchange market, after the recovery of the</p>
<p>hidden capital of Mr. Zangben, the Japanese Deputy Consul, the market sentiment was slightly boosted, and prices rose by 4 to 5 jiao in each month. When trading reached the second and third rounds, large merchants sold off ahead of the festival, and the market suddenly changed, with prices falling round after round. As a result, prices fell by 4, 7, 8, and 9 jiao in each month. In the afternoon, it was reported that the Guang merchant group had liquidated a large number of "long" positions due to the small number of spot yarn transactions, and the market situation became even weaker. The current month fell by 1.1 yuan, and the distant months fell by 6 to 7 jiao. The total volume of transactions for the day was 37,500 bales. It was found that Da Ji sold 2,350 bales, Chang Ji sold 900 bales, Jun Chang sold 1,550 bales, Renfeng sold 1,200 bales, Taichang sold 3,500 bales, Huikang sold 1,150 bales, Tongxing sold 600 bales, Zhenda sold 600 bales, and Yuantai sold 700 bales. Hengchang bought 2,050 bales, Dafeng bought 1,100 bales, Chunji bought 1,000 bales, Minghua bought 800 bales, Huikang bought 1,000 bales, Dachangcheng bought 1,500 bales, Jinchang bought 650 bales, and Changyu bought 600 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Stock on Account</p>
<p>June 178.2 176.1 17.61 Down 1.50 28,800</p>

<p>Total 306,150</p>
<h3>Spot Sales Become Increasingly Weak</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales are becoming increasingly weak. It has been found that various merchant groups purchased a total of 458 bales throughout the day, with prices falling by 5 jiao. The purchase volume of each merchant group is as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 100 Inland 73 Ningbo 5 Wuhu 5 Guangdong 45 Overseas 230</p>
<p>The cotton market, after rising sharply for several days, is showing signs of declining. Although some "long"</p>
<p>companies have not completely given up, most have</p>
<p>exited the market. The sluggish sales of spot yarn and the increasingly severe reduction in factory work mean that less raw materials can be used. As for the new cotton crop in domestic fields, planting has generally increased, so there are still many who are selling on rallies.</p>
<h3>Zheng Cotton Gradually Shows Signs of Weakness</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Exchange market opened with a lack of buyers and a weak market situation. Foreign cotton was also flat, with prices falling by 1 to 2 jiao in each month. In the afternoon, as the yarn market trended lower, market sentiment was even weaker, with prices falling by 5 fen to 2 to 3 jiao in each month. The total volume of transactions for the day was 65,300 dan. It was found that Tongxing sold 3,000 dan, Jun Chang sold 1,900 dan, Tongji sold 1,700 dan, Mingde sold 1,100 dan, Renfeng sold 5,900 dan, Hengchang sold 1,100 dan, Xincheng sold 1,100 dan, and Xiesheng sold 1,100 bales. Dafeng bought 1,400 dan, Chunji bought 1,900 dan, Gengfeng bought 2,400 dan, Yuanda bought 2,800 dan, Yuande bought 1,000 dan, Changfeng bought 3,900 dan, Yiyu bought 1,000 dan, Hengchang bought 1,000 dan, and Changhe bought 1,200 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>

<p>Total 796,800</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Factories Require Small Quantities</h3>
<p>Spot cotton demand is quite sluggish. Sources include 650 bales of Tong cotton and 108 bales of Yao cotton. Spot cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 45.00 Yuan'an Factory Purchases 300 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 55.50 Baoxing Factory Purchases 160 Pieces Again Again</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 45.75 Hongzhang Factory Purchases 100 Pieces Again Again</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 42.00 Again 300 Bales Again Again</p>
<h3>American Cotton Shows Little Change</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially strong due to good market sentiment, but later retreated due to profit-taking on "longs." As a result, spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices fluctuated by one pound. English cotton futures rose by 8 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to profit-taking on "longs," but later rose due to purchases by Japanese merchants and speculators. As a result, Pinga Er rose by 7 and a half jiao, Aomula rose by 3 rupees, and Bairro Creek rose by 2 rupees and 7 and a half jiao. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 13th).</p>

<h3>May Statistics on Shanghai Japanese Factory Yarn Sales</h3>
<p>The total amount of Shanghai Japanese factory yarn shipped to various regions in May was 40,378 bales, an increase of 2,476 bales compared to April. The reason for the increase in sales is said to be that the foreign exchange rate softened in early May, resulting in strong exports overseas. Purchasing power in North China and Shanghai was also</p>
<p>healthy. The bale amounts shipped to various regions are listed below (unit: bales).</p>
<p>Qinhuangdao 431 Tianjin 7,197 Qingdao 2,404 Yantai 716</p>
<p>Hankou 992 Hong Kong 872 India 4,775 Shanghai 10,740 Japan 6,598</p>
<h3>Grain Shows Signs of Weakness: Flour and Wheat</h3>
<p>The flour market has become less active. After the morning market opened, foreign wheat prices were reported down by about 1 yuan and 5 to 6 jiao, and the market sentiment was already weak. Then, there was selling of "shorts" from factories and sales of "longs," so a slight downward trend was seen after the opening. The afternoon opening was even more lackluster, with recent months down by about 3 fen and distant months down by more than 2 fen. Because outside parties hoarding purchases stopped selling due to lower foreign prices, "floating longs" and new "shorts" competed to sell, and the strong selling of Fuxin and Fufeng factories caused the market to be so lackluster. The closing market saw some short-covering and stabilization. The closing prices were down 2 fen for the current month, down 1.75 fen for the next month, down 1</p>
<p>and a half fen for August to October, and down 1.25 fen for November.</p>
<p>The wheat market fell immediately because of the selling of inland and northern customers, the sharp drop of 1 yuan in foreign wheat prices, and the strong arrival of new spot wheat. In the afternoon, merchants engaged in arbitrage selling, so the market moved lower. The closing prices were down 5 fen for July and September, down 3 fen for August, down 4 fen for October, and down 6 fen for November. The arrival of new spot wheat included 4,000 bales from Dajiao, Huangqiao, and Gaoyou at 2.82 and 2/3 yuan, 2.77 and 7/8 yuan from Puzhen and Heqiao, 2.8 jiao from Yangzhou, 2.68 yuan from Kunshan, and 2.65 yuan from Anting and Penglai. Fuxin took 4,000 bales, Huafeng took 1,000 bales, and Fufeng took 1,500 bales, for a total of 6,500 bales. The market price softened slightly by 1 to 2 fen due to the large arrival.</p>
<h3>Late Rice: Northern Merchant Groups Still Have Healthy Appetites</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's sources from various merchant groups were the 25th and 26th (a total of over 4,000 shi of goods), among which late rice was more numerous than mid-season rice. The route for late rice was still畅办（can't translate this), and the market shape was very tight, with the market rising more than 1 jiao. Although the appetites for various thick粳(Jing rice type) continued to move more than 300 bags, the market in the street was清寂(silent), and the market remained stable. very little Du Yang尖(a type of rice) was開做(can't translate this), the market color was relatively stable and soft.陰元(can't translate this) has not been traded, 變元(can't translate this) route轉滯(became sluggish), and the market fell 1角(jiao).

<h3>Minhang Broad Beans Fell to 2.8 Yuan</h3>
<p>Although the source of new broad beans was not high yesterday, the market also had more than 20包(bags)抵埠(arrived), and only half of the routes were, resulting in the market situation falling all the way, yesterday, Minhang Qing 蠶(a type of broad bean) only started航船貨(shipped cargo) more than 100包(bags), the price was 2.8 yuan, for 本街(this street) to take away, the market was 比(compared to) the previous market fell 5角(jiao), compared to the first time the price of 75 identity,見跌(see fall) 1.5 yuan, today, it is the first day of new goods listing以來(since), the purchasing power has 見不濟(see a lack of, not helping), I am afraid that there will be more pessimistic 後之市(future market), Jia定白蠶(a type of broad bean)opened more than 1,000包(bags), for 天帮(Tian帮: the Tianjin帮 merchants, or merchant association) 辦去(辦去:辦去 is a phrase, means ‘handled by’ or ‘taken care of by’, but can also imply a sale in this context). the price was 3 yuan, market fell 1角(jiao), 吳江(Wujiang) 青蠶(a type of broad bean)opened 2.4角(jiao) also fell 2角(jiao),菜籽(rapeseed)无市(no market).</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Foreign Firm Tea Market is Thriving</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market of foreign firms in the city continued to trade actively. All European firms, because both England and France have postal ships departing these days, urgently need it, so they had to go ahead and猛進(advance violently). The entire city operates more than 20 boxes of tea industry. The market can be called extremely prosperous. Because the sales are lively, all tea markets are trending strongly. However, Zhenmei and Zhenmei green tea from Tunxi, Shexian, and Suian have all been sold out. After several days of畅销(selling smoothly), the stock of Qi浮紅茶(紅茶 black tea) is not very thick either. The tea market situation has gradually entered a good situation.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Silk Cocoon Market in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>New Cocoons in Yancheng Open at a Lower Price: In the various towns and villages of Yancheng, silkworm farming has been declining in recent years. This year, the silkworm rearing is still not prosperous. Only two firms, such as Yixing, are weighing and collecting cocoons. The cocoon price is not high. Improved varieties are only about 2 jiao per jin, while local varieties are 1 jiao 3 or 4 fen. Cocoon firms' purchase volume is limited, making it difficult for silkworm farmers to profit.</p>
<p>Jiangyin Cocoon Firms Close Down One After Another: This year, more than 30 cocoon firms opened in the four rural areas of Jiangyin. After weighing and collecting for a week, they are now gradually closing down due to the scarcity of goods arriving on the market. The average cocoon price for improved varieties is only 32-33 yuan, causing silkworm farmers to lose money. Most of them are drying the cocoons themselves.</p>
<p>Wuxi New Cocoons Tested for Reeling: New-style cocoons from Wuxi have been transported to Shanghai. According to the results of the testing done in various factories, the improved variety cocoons can only produce 100 jin of raw silk from 450 jin of dry cocoons. With high prices for fresh cocoons, the improved variety costs 35 yuan, drying 280 jin (i.e., drying into 100 jin of dry cocoons). Then the cost of silk is more than 450 yuan per dan, plus more than 100 yuan for reeling labor, etc. According to the current price of silk in foreign firms, the factories will still lose money.</p>
<p>Silk Sales in Europe and America Become More Difficult to Turn Around: Silk factories in New York and Lyon are unable to sell their silk, and silk prices continue to weaken. The Shanghai telegrams still show no signs of turning around. The market atmosphere is weak and stagnant. Silk sales are becoming more difficult to turn around. Yesterday, only Dafeng and other firms imported 20 bales of white factory silk and 5 bales of white Da Jing silk, and the prices were still weak.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Enamel Factories Scour for Waste Iron Sheets</h3>
<p>Enamel factories have recently seen a very active trade in waste iron sheets. In recent days, purchases have reached more than 1,000 dan. Colored sheets of 2.6 chi and 1.8 chi sizes are becoming very scarce, and colored sheets of 1.1 chi to 1.3 chi, etc., have been completely scoured. Prices are rising sharply. For example, 1.8 chi sheets are estimated at 9 yuan 5 jiao, and 1.1 chi to 1.3 chi sheets are estimated at prices ranging from 9 yuan 5 jiao to 10 yuan 5 jiao. It is said that recently, due to the shortage of spot goods, the selling price has been asked for 11 yuan, which shows the firmness of the market.</p>
<h3>Garden Brand Galvanized Wire: Quietness Provokes Thought</h3>
<p>Recently, Jiangxi merchants have actively been trading Garden Brand galvanized wire, and have been buying up a total of five or six hundred bundles over the past few days, and there are still those negotiating. As a result, the market is brisk. It is said that each bundle is estimated at 4 yuan 5 jiao, which is 2 jiao 5 fen better than before.</p>

<h3>Refuting Prophecies</h3>
<p>— Bai Rong</p>
<p>A very interesting piece of news that I saw in several mainland newspapers and Chinese newspapers a few days ago was the various prophecies of a certain foreign female prophet, Ms. Laila, about the current situation. At the same time, the mainland newspapers also printed a photo of her sharp eyes on the newspaper, which shows people's attention to this matter. However, regarding this matter, we really dare not fully believe it. Now I will describe my thoughts below.</p>
<p>Chinese people's minds seem to have never undergone the baptism of science. They hold a kind of quasi-spiritualist view of everything. The New Culture Movement has been going on for decades, but the cultural level of the general public has not yet broken through the initial stage of the theocratic period described by Comte, even among the more advanced intellectual class. This cannot but be said to be a strange thing. On the one hand, they are shouting slogans of "science to save the country," while on the other hand, heresies are rampant, injecting intense toxins into the minds of the people. For example, the popular "scientific planchette writing" of late is clear evidence of this kind of deception of the people in the name of science. And recently, this primitive witch-like "prophet" has also invaded our lives along with the guns and goods of imperialism.</p>
<p>We don't talk about whether her predictions are accurate, let's first look at whether the kind of thing called prophecy can be established? What is its basis? According to our foolish view, this kind of thing called prophecy cannot be established at all. The so-called ability to know the past and future is just engaging in the work of a wishful dreamer in the style of a shaman. We only believe in history. The progress of history and the transformation of society have their own inevitable laws. However, this is scientific and has a law of cause and effect, not random nonsense. Like Ms. Laila, we also know that Japan and Russia will eventually engage in a war, but what forms our view is not mysterious speculation, but the iron-like facts formed by the intertwined actions of international politics and economics. We also believe that China will surely be revived, but this revival is not some kind of divine will, but is determined and promoted by material conditions. Not understanding the facts in a down-to-earth way, but shaking one's head and talking about the Heavenly principle in the dark, this is an irredeemable ignorance. Believing in this ignorance and being constrained by determinism is an infantile farce and absurdity!</p>
<p>Here, I would like to say a word to my compatriots. Not a small number of things are imported into our country from foreign countries. Although there are steam engines and radios among them, there are also foreign wines and morphine. Foreign things are not all worthy of worship. As the people of our country, with a lower culture as a semi-colony, when facing imported goods and being influenced by them, we should accept them with a critical and selective attitude. We must set up a line of defense in our thinking so that all toxic bacteria will not invade our lives and affect our health. The popularity of sensual and erotic American films in recent years should have left a shocking impact on countless pure young people! As long as you think about it calmly, you should understand that foreign things are not all reliable, right?</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, Ms. Laila's predictions are very likely to affect us. Here, the Chinese people's lack of scientific concepts and the mentality of blindly worshiping foreigners can promote the popularity of this fallacy. But the most important thing is still determined by our economic life. The oppression of the great powers, endless internal strife, and years of epidemics make us feel isolated and helpless. In the process of struggling for survival, isolated and helpless people will inevitably shift their eyes to heaven, hoping for the salvation of the gods, and thus the religious nature of our nation is conceived. Because of being in disaster and turmoil for a long time, the ideology of determinism and the concept of retribution have gained a deep foothold in the minds of the people. Just look at the Tui Bei Tu and scientific planchette writing of recent years. Which one was not produced at the most difficult and dangerous time?</p>
<p>Predictions are unreliable. I hope everyone will use science as a serum injection to sweep away the superstitious toxins in our blood, because only this can save us from ignorance!</p>
<h3>The Wife's Husband</h3>
<p>— Mu Lin</p>
<p>Two men, one tall and one short, were sent out from the revolving door every day at five o'clock. They walked to their homes together, talking all the way. Regardless of wind, snow, rain or shine, they were being oppressed by the burden of life, saving a few copper coins in tram fare by using their two walking legs.</p>
<p>At this time, five o'clock, one tall and one short man were sent out from the revolving door, as usual, each walking with their heads lowered, they could feel their way home even with their eyes closed.</p>
<p>However, it was not so. The shorter one nodded to the taller one, and at the same time, without knowing what he said, he walked alone towards the tram station. This was a rare thing. His wife did not allow him to bring more than one copper coin's worth of Fairy brand cigarettes when he went out. He approached the tram station, and seemed to realize that he had no change in his pocket. He pondered for a moment, and proudly sat on a rickshaw and left. This was naturally an even rarer thing. Estimating the time he usually spent walking, the rickshaw fare must be above the price of three packs of Fairy brand cigarettes.</p>
<p>He pushed open the back door. A middle-aged woman was washing clothes by the tap, it was his wife. As usual, they did not exchange a word, one taking care of her work, and the other taking care of going upstairs. However, it was not so. The wife saw her husband returning, and quickly wiped her hands dry and followed him upstairs. Entering the bedroom 丨丨 it was such a small attic room. The man had not settled down yet, and the wife, with a rare smile on her face, opened up: "Got a few more dollars?"</p>
<p>The husband's behavior was also rarely bizarre. He pulled his wife's hands and sat down on the edge of the bed. This kind of enthusiastic expression had never happened since they got married and moved to Shanghai. Today was truly a rare day. He gently patted the back of her hand and asked gently:</p>
<p>"What do you guess?"</p>
<p>The wife tilted her head, her eyes fixed on the other person, seemingly revealing a rare charming state and said:</p>
<p>"Six dollars? No," she busily corrected herself, "four dollars then?"</p>
<p>"Ha, neither!" the husband said, and the other person seemed disappointed and retracted her smile; but the husband then said: "Eight dollars!" and stretched out his right hand and waved it in front of his wife.</p>
<p>The wife clapped her hands and jumped up from the edge of the bed. "You work so hard. Lao Guan really knows. That's why I always tell you not to be lazy; in another three years, if we add to it like this, we can also bring my mother out to live with us." After she finished speaking, she spread out her palms evenly.</p>
<p>The husband took out banknotes and coins from his inner pocket, one five, one ten, ······ twenty-eight yuan and four jiao and put them all on his wife's palm, then breathed a sigh of relief and lay down on the bed to rest.</p>
<p>"Hey, there's still two mao missing?"</p>
<p>The husband raised his head slightly, "Took a rickshaw back."</p>
<p>The wife turned her head to look at the clock on the wall. It was still ten minutes earlier than usual. On the one hand, she felt it was a pity that the two mao had been spent so wastefully, and on the other hand, she was not willing to question her husband too much, and said to herself: "Three days' worth of cigarette money!" and said as she hid the banknotes and coins in her box.</p>
<p>"Really, I was too busy today, and I finished smoking my cigarettes early. Buy me a pack!" He paused, as if embarrassed, "Buy a pack of Mei Li Brand."</p>
<p>The sounds of the words lowered one by one, but the wife had already heard clearly, "What? Who told you to take a rickshaw? Wouldn't you have two packs even if you didn't eat Mei Li Brand? Just smoke Xian Nv Brand."</p>
<p>The husband smiled and privately thought, "Even if I didn't take a rickshaw, I wouldn't be able to smoke Mei Li Brand. Women always have women's calculations. Men are always the wives' husbands." After eating dinner, he smoked a cigarette and said to his wife: "If I get eight more dollars next year, I can smoke Mei Li Brand."</p>
<p>"Let's talk about it next year!" Although she said it with a smile, the husband knew that next year's cigarette issue had already been decided here in advance.</p>
<p>"Men are always the wives' husbands!" He looked at his wife's face from the smoke rings.</p>
<h3>Graduation and Termination of Life</h3>
<p>— He Juefu</p>
<p>Among the classmates, there was a lot of rumor about Lao Li's suicide, and it was confirmed yesterday.</p>
<p>Li Li, was a young man who loved to joke and make trouble: his personality was so gentle, and his demeanor was so flexible. I really didn't believe it at first that someone as optimistic as him would commit suicide; but, the suicide note and portrait he left to his father, and the many small poems of farewell he wrote on a notepad, were clearly placed in front of my eyes; the news that he committed suicide in the Wusong Sea and that his body had been picked up by local farmers was published in the Xin Ye Bao the night before, and all the students had seen it. How dare you suspect that someone is lying?</p>
<h3>Homesick Serenade</h3>
<p>— Qiuyue</p>
<p>The night is so quiet and desolate, the crystal clear moon emits her faint remaining light. I sit alone in the shade of the locust tree, gazing at the distant blue sky, X · X · X</p>
<p>Alas! The past is like smoke, unbearable to look back on! Ah! Moon, please shine your clear light on my heart, take me to my longing hometown. My hometown, ah! I always look at you from afar and feel melancholy!</p>
<p>X · X · X</p>
<p>I have been away from home for three years. I wonder if the scenery there is the same as in the past? 丨丨 The smoky trees there, the misty white clouds of the lakes and mountains there. Ah ah! And also, the tender green seedlings, when the wind comes, the waves form in the rice fields.··</p>
<p>X · X · X</p>
<p>I want to go back, I want to go back! Ah! My hometown after three years of separation! Ah! My hometown, I can only look at you from afar and feel melancholy now!</p>
<p>Originally, a person's suicide is not a big deal in this day and age; but, to take one's own life because of failing to graduate, I always feel a little sad!</p>
<p>"Hey! Lao Li is really too cowardly!" His death, I can't find an explanation, last night in front of Lao Lin, I sighed like this. 丨丨 Because Lao Lin was a relatively close one to him.</p>
<p>"It's not fair to blame him for being cowardly, he has received too many stimuli: he graduated in the 'January 28th' semester, and it happened to coincide with the outbreak of the war, and he couldn't graduate; last year, he and a few friends forged diplomas together and were admitted to the second grade of XX University, and after reading just one semester, everyone else was soaring, and he was the only one who was found out by the school and immediately expelled from school; this year, he came back to study the second semester of senior year, thinking that everything would go smoothly, who would have thought he would run into this snag again? Moreover, he is studying liberal arts, and he had never learned advanced natural sciences in school before, and this time he failed to graduate because he failed higher physics and analytic geometry, how could he not be angry? Originally, not getting a diploma is not a big deal in our opinion; but, he studies so hard, and his reputation has always been very good, and now he can't even graduate from school, he can't stand his parents' scolding, people's ridicule and mockery!" Lao Lin retorted my words very indignantly.</p>
<p>Even after Lao Lin told me in such detail, even though I also know that a person's suicide can never be explained as simply as I do with the words "personal cowardice"; but, besides being able to dig at the dead a few words, who dares to blame that one, attribute it to that kind of system!</p>
<p>The period of the graduation examination has not yet arrived; but, a young life has come to an end!</p>
<p>Last year, I saw the news that Mr. Liu Weihan of Nankai University committed suicide by jumping off a building because he failed to graduate, and I felt unhappy for a long time; unexpectedly, this year my classmate Lao Li suffered this disaster again, how can I not sigh? Fortunately, I, who have little knowledge, only know about Mr. Liu and my classmate Lao Li!</p>
<h3>Piglets and Sardines 丨Memories of Impressions of Southeast Asia丨</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>The piglets mentioned here are not the small pigs that we usually see being raised in fences, but the Chinese who do hard labor in the "Shamba" of the Southeast Asian islands; the sardines requested are by no means the sardines that are used as food, but a kind of miner who has invisibly sold his life; in short, the piglets and sardines mentioned here are people who have been driven to the line of death under the urging of life!</p>
<p>The Southeast Asian islands of many years ago were simply a gold mine in the eyes of us Chinese, because in that period, quite a few people went to Southeast Asia empty-handed, but came back with huge amounts of wealth. However, today, the Chinese living in the Southeast Asian islands are declaring bankruptcy due to business failures under double oppression. The wealthy who once owned huge sums of money have once become paupers, and a group of people who rely on the wealthy to live are even more unimaginable! Thus, the human species of piglets came into being.</p>
<p>Because the Chinese workers who cannot stand in the city are squeezed into the "Shamba" to do various kinds of hard labor, they are piglets. They have to work more than ten hours a day, and the price they get is at most one yuan a day, and they have to endure the exploitation of the foremen. Moreover, because the climate is hot and life is hard, the mountain winds and miasma, poisonous snakes and beasts in the "Shamba" cause deaths (the so-called dead piglets) that are heard of every day. In reality, the piglets who are squeezed into the Shamba, even if they have great skills, have no hope of returning to their country. It seems that fate has decided: a lifetime is a piglet, death is the end!</p>
<p>Similarly, in the country, there are many people who have escaped from bankrupt rural villages, and people who are overwhelmed by the huge stones of life, dreaming of getting rich by mining, and sending their healthy bodies into the mines, where they are buried alive, just like sardines in cans.</p>
<p>Batches of sardines are brought from all over to the mines, and the beautiful dream of getting rich is shattered by the life of a prisoner! After they sign a work contract of ten or fifteen years, they have to work for the company for more than ten hours every day in the mines filled with miasma. In that dark hell, they are subjected to abuse and exploitation. It is said that this mine is alive when you come in, and you can't get out even when you die!</p>
<p>The sardines in the mine are like prisoners in a prison, with only numbers and no names. They live in the same furnace room as the prison, and their life is: they have to get up just as the sky is getting light, and the mine police shout outside the door, and everyone in the room walks out practically. Everyone is wearing the same coarse linen clothes, wearing a coarse linen hat, carrying a sack, and nails on their feet. Each room of sardines is lined up in a row, escorted by several armed mine police, and walks through the foggy mountain road and into the mine cave, until the evening, when they drag their tired bodies back to the furnace room. That's how they end their lives!</p>

<h3>The Zongzi-Selling Woman</h3>
<p>— Jenny</p>
<p>It's always rainy, the streets are muddy. From morning on, she carries a wooden bucket in one hand and a bamboo basket in the other, walking through the mud. She is a Zongzi-selling woman!</p>
<p>During the plum rain season of every May, she usually shouts in the street from morning: "Anyone want Zongzi?"</p>
<p>Although she also hates this always rainy season, but because she is disgusted by life, she has to hate in her stomach. Sometimes she has a layer of anger on her face, but no one will sympathize with her.</p>
<p>Just talk about last year! Although she also shouted in the street from morning, "Anyone want Zongzi?" If it was raining heavily, or braving the wind, and feeling uncomfortable and unhappy, she didn't have to get up early and carry a wooden bucket to the street to shout and sell Zongzi, because last year her son had a job in the factory, and her husband also set up a small stall on the street corner or in the alley every day, and he always earned something every day, and the whole family spent their days very comfortably and peacefully.</p>
<p>The situation has changed since this year. The man got sick and died in the first month, and the son was also laid off from the factory at this time, and is still idle at home. In fact, in this painful environment, in the muddy rainy days of May's plum season, no matter what, she can't be unhappy and carry a wooden bucket to the street early in the morning to shout: "Anyone want Zongzi?" And her shouting now is not like the listless monosyllabic shouts of last year. Instead, she shouts crisply like singing a ditty:</p>
<p>"Anyone want Zongzi? Red bean paste Zongzi, meat Zongzi!"</p>
<p>The buyers surrounded her. She is very amiable and casual, and she doesn't really like to haggle over a few pennies. And especially the rickshaw pullers who stop by the sidewalk, she never discusses unrealistic prices with them.</p>
<p>丨丨 They may be even more miserable than me! She often thinks this way, and even forgets her own life's pain.</p>
<h3>Talking About Science</h3>
<p>— Shi Dan</p>
<p>Chinese people seem to have become much more revolutionary in recent years. Just talking about "foreign devils" and everything done by foreign devils is much more polite than in the "closed-door" and "butt-whipping" era. Whenever foreign devils have some new tricks, we Chinese are actually willing to learn to play with them. However, what is disappointing is that after the Chinese play with it, that thing will often become blurred in its original form, or become boundless. For example, humorous literature is a new trick that foreign devils want, but once Chinese people learn to play with it, it will become a clownish transformation. This can be said to be a blurring of the original form.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century, science has become the darling of the times. No matter what, as long as you raise this magnificent and beautiful banner, you can pass unimpeded everywhere. So here comes: draw a ghost face, print some different words; add a saucer, and have three people hold it up, and stir up a ghost, this is science! Lay off some workers and add a few machines, this is also science!</p>
<p>Now, even the shoes worn on the feet have become scientific. It is said that they are "manufactured using scientific methods, and they are very comfortable to wear." This is a bit too naive to say, so naive that people dare not believe it. People's feet are large and small, fat and thin, pointed and round, narrow and wide, and I am afraid that there is no way to find a scientific law. According to what is said, shoes are just such a thing, a long and slightly square box-like thing that is worn on the feet. In that case, since the advent of thin-soled walking shoes, they have always been "manufactured using scientific methods" (except for the powder-soled black boots, which are stiff and inconvenient). What is now called various kinds is just raising this beautiful banner again.</p>
<p>Now there are some clever people who are making a fuss about what is called scientific, 丨 which has actually existed for a long time 丨 that is very funny to talk about. Wrapping a layer of white paper on the outside of a dim sum is scientific. If the "liver" mentioned by Chinese medicine is said to be the "nerve," this is especially scientific. Covering a white cloth on the table in a restaurant, and adding a piece of glass, so it is advertised in the newspaper as scientific scientific. But the kitchen is still a dancing ground for flies.</p>
<p>According to the author's opinion, only the hole on the lid of the Chinese teapot and the waterwheel are scientific. When it comes to "scientific," changing beheading to shooting is one of them.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>The Chaste Mother's Memorial Arch (2)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>To Shi Min, everything was fresh and wondrous. On the eastern mountaintop, the milky white sky was beginning to show, and within the fish scale-like clouds, there was a hint of crimson, though one had to look very carefully to see it. The sounds of crickets of all sorts surrounded him, calling from every direction; some were sharp, like blowing through a wheat stalk, others were "chirp, chirp, chirp," and still others were hoarse serpent-like croaks, along with the varied tones of frogs. Usually, these sounds could be heard when enjoying the cool air beneath the peach trees in the courtyard, or when lying down and counting the stars, but today, they seemed especially delightful. Everything was fresh and wondrous. The calls of the crickets, in particular, felt extremely intimate. He thought to himself, "When I get back, I'm going to catch a lot of crickets in the village and have a big fight with Aunt's Big Head Ghost. I'll definitely win. Aunt's crickets are all caught in the garden at home, so they won't be true old breeds. The ones I catch in the village and on the fields will definitely be much stronger than that Big Head Ghost." Aunt's crickets get fed ginseng water, and Shi Min also knew that his mother's ginseng was kept in the second small drawer of her dressing case. He would definitely steal one or two slices for his own cricket to eat. Once he raised it to be fat and strong, what was there to fear from her Big Head Ghost? Just thinking about this, everything seemed meaningful to him, even the barking of the village dogs seemed to be especially energetic because of his visit.</p>
<p>Before long, the group, along with their empty baskets and sickles, stopped in the field beside the main road at the village entrance. Soon, the familiar sound of sickles cutting rice began around the young master. Further away, the sound of threshing rice sounded like a string of firecrackers going off. In the very early morning, this sound, mixed with the clamorous chirping of insects, formed a rhythm of music that was strangely crisp. However, to the farmhands, these sounds didn't seem particularly lovely, because they were all too familiar. Although the young master didn't understand anything about musical melodies, this was the first time he had encountered this scene.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Shi Shi Min soon began catching crickets, right next to the empty garden beside the field. But it wasn't fully light yet, and he could only hear the crickets calling, their ancient, ripped-cloth-like sounds, which to him surely meant that they were old crickets with deep black legs and long bodies. But no matter how quietly he tiptoed over, there was no way he could catch them. So he felt indescribably anxious, even cursing; why wasn't it light yet? All he could do was stick a branch in the ground wherever he liked the sound of a cricket calling, as a marker, and wait for dawn to come and then he would take action, they definitely wouldn't escape. Running back and forth like this, the dew on the grass had soaked through his cloth-soled shoes, making them cold. It was very quiet at this time. Suddenly, he saw several black shadows moving slowly in the field, like a few large beetles. After thinking for a moment, he realized they were ghosts, so he shouted loudly and ran straight towards Gray Hen and the others. Later, after their explanation that those were just people cutting rice, he did</p>
<p>believe them somewhat, but the thought of ghosts still made his hair stand on end and feel strangely terrifying.</p>
