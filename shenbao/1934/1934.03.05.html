<p>久無生氣之軍備縮小會議。自德意志退出國聯以後。更不能順序開會。最近英國國璽尙書艾登爲軍縮問題歷訪巴黎羅馬柏林各地之政治首領提出英國備忘錄與之商酌。惟詳細内容。未經公佈。電傳英國將於本月召集軍縮特别會議於倫敦美法意日波比。西與小恊約國均被邀出席。卽退出國聯之德意志。及立於另一極端之蘇聯。亦與其列。美國且擬提出重要議案。以不用兵力侵略隣國爲號召。艾登所提之備忘錄。如果爲該會開議之根據。殆不外限制攻擊武器。其性質終屬於軍備之技術問題而已。</p>
<p>茲先就歐洲大陸之情勢立論。任何國家皆未嘗自認有攻擊他國之凖備。最大限度不過在於保障安全。强覇如法蘭西。持有世界第一之陸軍與航空隊。歐洲第一之巨大資財。復聯合各小國以爲已助。然亦未曾揚言有絶對攻擊之武器也。意大利則後法一着。無論在中歐在北非。莫不急起直追。圖與法國爭覇。是以竭力擴張空軍。前此横渡大西洋之飛行隊。卽其表現之一端。德國屈處凡爾賽和約之下已久。不甘再受壓迫。故决然退出國聯。以爭軍備平等。但以今日德意志之財力與國民經濟。殊難與法意之軍備爭短長。彼所恃者。惟其國民多年之科學技術訓練。與軍國民精神耳。英國乃思調和其間以和平方法勉强維持現狀。詎知東方有專以擄掠爲事之日本。匪特肆力擴張其軍備。且四出侵略。强占我國東北四省。暗襲南洋。印度以及非洲市塲。近又盲目突進。思染指於西比利亞。蘇聯乃不能不嚴加戒備。是以世界各國於軍備之增加。雖尙未十分露骨。而由其軍需工業之盛興。卽足以證明軍備縮小之難期矣。</p>
<p>再以英美而論。英國在外交上可謂老成圓滑。在國防上。亦堪稱堅實穩妥。當世任何一國之海軍。均不能制英國死命。英國且有力足以保持商務之巨大航船隊與交通聯絡。然其新嘉坡築港計劃與新增四個航空大隊。意果何居非備遠東有萬一事變耶。非圖印度洋上之安全耶。非鞏固　洋之門户耶。故英國雖倡軍備縮小之說。徒爲技術上之論爭。會議席上之敷衍耳美國講究産業復興計劃。不遺餘力但海外市塲。旣劃定範圍。歐洲發展之路。亦早見阻滯。南美方面。英美之經濟對立斷難和緩。而英帝國内之經濟聯盟。又處處牽制美國之發展。遠東市塲幾全爲日本所支配。美國經濟推進之前。途殊乏武力之保障。其國内一般消費力。又極薄弱。最後出路。惟有向軍需工業方面擴張。如建造百二艘軍艦也。新置千架轟炸機也。皆爲形勢緊張之顯示。烏見有軍縮之可能。</p>
<p>茲者奥大利以彈丸之地且新增陸軍七萬德國誠受凡爾賽和約之制限而十萬陸軍盡爲將校。一旦戰事發生。鋼盔挺進隊。卽可變爲勁旅。德人尙武之精神。復仇之狂熱。復屢屢流露於外。總之軍備縮小。大國對之并未有充分實行之誠意。眞正爭端發生。卽陷於無法解决之窘境。如法意之海軍競爭問題如維持或修改英美日主力艦五·五·三比率之糾紛。如滿洲之軍事行動等。皆其例證。今世界尙可勉强維持現狀者。蓋因各國有自身之盾矛。任何强國皆不敢盲目挑釁。故一度緊張之後。仍繼以殭持。今後之特别軍縮會議。卽令事前已經相當之疏通。仍不免蹈旣往之覆轍。欲求相當之軍縮。恐須待下次大戰之後耳。</p>

<p>（莫斯科）　蘇聯名記者拉狄克論溥儀稱帝事云、「清室自經一九一一年中國人民革命之輪摧毁而後、其末代子孫又乘堅甲之汽車、在日本士兵保護之下登極稱滿洲皇帝矣、日帝國主義之報界且尊之爲滿洲和平之保障、夫日本軍閥於歷史之飛輪捲去於歐洲最稱强盛之皇室如霍亨卓倫·哈勃司堡·及羅曼諾夫之後、乃傾聽「滿洲人民之呼籲」、及其自身保王之情感、以使一帝國出現於世界、故日帝國主義報界對之遂備加讚揚、</p>

<p>援引吳三桂故事　拉氏援引中國歷史、稱滿國入關主政乃得力於吳三桂、吳氏爲農民之暴動所窘、故深悉農民之行徑、遂請滿人入關統治中國、而援助自身鎭壓暴動農民、「日本軍閥深信中國將有多數新吳三桂、彼等爲工農革命之新高潮所威脅、俱願貫澈蔣介石之政策、日本軍閥以此爲懷、故創建帝國、並令溥儀登極佔領滿洲、自非最稱果决之日本帝國主義者之終結目標、熱河或内蒙亦未能饜其所欲、</p>
<p>準備進一步侵略　此等運動俱爲凖備未來進佔之初步、日本軍閥法西分子對中國統一之觀念殊爲顫慄、蓋擁有四萬萬人民之中國一經統一、且有新式牛産工具與新式武器、將令全世界力量之構成爲之劇變、而亞洲力量之構成將全部變更、日本軍閥左右憂慮、如中國走上資本主義途徑、則彼將唯美國之馬首是瞻、彼如走上社會主義一途、則將以蘇聯爲靠山、上述途徑對於渴望統馭亞洲者了無是處、日本軍人中一部分希望將中國領土儘量分割、一部分則企圖以日本帝國主義而統治統一之中國、彼等相信中國階級鬥爭之深化、將令中國地主及資本家之統治集團避居滿洲、以日本刺刀爲保衞、如此則日人將長驅直入長江流域、其所用口號必非合併、而爲以清室之合法政權統一中國、是時日本帝國主義則以後臺資格、攫取中國全部最重要之地位、此即爲溥儀登極之意義也、</p>
<p>爭取亞洲領導權　溥儀當依扶日本刺刀登極稱帝之際、卽向世界宣告其將執行之歷史的任務、彼宣告於舉世曰、「所謂滿洲國者將夾居於蘇聯與東方之間、而爲防制赤化遠東之堡壘、其於世界之貢獻、不亦大乎、」日本軍閥希望以赤化危機恫嚇帝國主義世界、以此而謀自身勢力在中國之擴張、一面以削弱其他帝國主義列强抵抗、溥儀及其後臺老　之希望不僅在反蘇聯、彼等乃欲爭取日本在亞洲之領導權也、</p>

<p>「政友會」有二相反之觀測、（一）現内閣因綱紀問題繼續發生、中島·鳩山·兩相相繼辭職、其辭職理由、現置不問、惟齋藤首相之奏請責任、在所難免、且内閣内因米榖統制問題、後藤永井兩相之意見各異、暴露内閣之不統一、况現内閣之應反者、大體已無、故已無期待、不能存續雖或渡過議會、終不免崩潰、至於鳩山文相之補充、旣不與政友交涉、復無何項表示、因係察悉其間之情形云、其（二）謂不補充鳩山文相之復任者、預算若獲通過、議會復補充之、此爲緩和貴院反對政府空氣、齋藤首相一派之狡猾手段、待議會完畢後、將謀永居内閣之策、因此或以繼任人物未得、或以西園寺公不希望政變等爲口實、單獨補充文相、或實行改造一部内閣謀久居也、至於政友會本身、因目下之政情、卽使發生政變、但於自黨無政權希望、故暫維現狀、待釀成恢復政黨内閣之氣運時、希望總辭職云、</p>
<p>「民政黨」現内閣因鳩山文相已辭職、預算案並救濟農村預算、當可安然通過、又外地米之統制問題亦已依衆院希望、不久當可决定、結果或能過渡議會、惟議會完畢後、因補充文相之難題、有謂將總辭職、但高橋山本兩相均同意維持内閣、故結果常平穩解决、而迄昭和十年度預算之編成期也云、</p>
<p>「國民同盟」現内閣對於我黨之不信任案、並不表示反省、此次議會或能安然渡過、但已完全暴露現内閣之無能爲、故議會後首相訪問西園寺表明辭意、至於後繼内閣、並非政黨内閣、是可斷言、而此次議會爲政黨恢復信用之絶佳機會、然因綱紀問題復失却信用、至於後繼内閣、必須爲有打開非常時之國策、並能實行之强有力内閣、於是平沼内閣較爲適當云、</p>
<p>「貴院」現内閣中島鳩山兩相旣已辭職、貴院不願負打倒現内閣之責行、不致積極攻擊現政府、惟現内閣無打開非常時手腕、故此際貴院應有意思表示、至於文相之復任、鈴木政友總裁所推薦之人物、不副政府所望、政府所希望者、政友又不願聞、若求於政黨外、則成與政友絶緣、將發生政局之危機、如是則現内閣方到達交代期云、（四日電通電）</p>

<h3 id="c87">美藍鷹運動後的新政策（紐約通信） <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>减低貨幣價値發展對外貿易</p>
<p>收回海外放欵克服經濟恐慌</p>
<p>自藍鷹運動實行之後、美國的經濟、似乎有了好轉的現象、一般人也都表示欣幸、但是事實上工廠製造出來的貨品、仍舊擺在棧房裏、爲消費者所消費的、到底是少數中的少數、何况一般人還是窮困、其窮困的程度、比實行産業復興法之前、並未减輕、所以多數的美國人、從前在纽約住的祗曉得盲目的享樂、什麽事情都要趕時髦、現在又祗曉得呌苦、丢了自用汽車而坐租賃車、坐不起租賃車、而坐公共汽車、生活的享受、却是减低了、但是依然少有人追究經濟恐慌的原因、政治趣味、還是很冷淡、英國的外交政策法國的縱横方略、日本的積極侵略、德國的猛烈硬趕、和美國一般社會、都似乎不甚相干、他們並不熱切的注意這些政治上經濟上的事態、在國外的一切事、絶對敵不過他們貿易熱積錢熱的情緒、卽以對蘇聯復交一事論、也是擴張貿易的計算、多於政治的意味、</p>
<p>可惜世界上再没有歐戰初期那樣的黄金時代、可以供美國盡量發展、海外各國的市塲、都據有强力的敵人、同時消費者又十分衰疲、那有許多餘力來消受美國高貴的製品、歐洲人的消費力是比較大些、可是各國都關起門來要自給自足、所以藍鷹運動的施行、縮短工作時間·增加工資·减少資本家利潤、是資本組織的新轉變、是一九三三年的新方法、然而收效還是很微小、算不得救濟美國的急假如就這樣繼續下去、非但不能克服恐慌、而且暫時的穩定也求不到、</p>
<p>因此纔又掉換新花樣、這就是一月三十一日所頒布减低美金圓純金成分的辦法、照此辦法、新金圓爲十五克冷又二十一分之五、（舊美金爲二五·八克冷）、爲舊幣百分之五九·○六、其减低的成分、約合百分之四十一、因貨幣價値减低的關係、政府可得到二十六萬八千六百萬美金的利益、不過其中要抽出二十萬萬美金作爲安定貨幣的資金、美國總統所以要如此採取通貨膨脹政策的理由、約有以下四端、</p>
<p>（一）金融界的週轉、也漸次不十分靈活、産業投資旣少、利息自然减低、政府所辦的公共事業、在生産的意義上講究、竟很有限、所以不能不用貨幣膨脹政策來扶植金融、增高其獨占的實力、同時剌激新興的産業、</p>
<p>（二）美金在國際匯兌上、誠然是跌落了、但並不穩定、所以貨品輸出、未見其激速增加、美國製品在海外、還是不能與日本英國競爭、這纔索性减低幣價、以求物品比價的增高、同時謀向外輸出的利益、</p>
<p>（三）美國對外投資、多半都凍結著、難於收回、凍結的原因、雖不止一端、但美金匯價過高、是其中重要原因之一、今後美金價値减低了、則投資的收回比較容易些、同時在國内債務者、也因而得到一點便宜、如果多數人能够還債、則金融的流通、就會比較暢旺、</p>
<p>（四）美政府在今年六月以前、要發行六十萬萬美金的公債、照目前的情形、美國一般人民、恐未必有消受的能力、而且貨幣價値不安定、人民也不敢輕於投資、現在這種辦法、能使幣價穩定、一般人纔樂於投資、政府的財源纔有希望、</p>
<p>這是羅斯福政府的希望、同時也是一般美國的希望、想從此可以漸漸的恢復以往的繁榮、但事實上會不會像藍鷹運動一樣、還是問題、要眞正得到解决、還不是容易的事啊、（一九三四年二月一日）</p>

<p>先生！過去我支配這二個鐘頭的　　的時間的讀書的計劃是這樣的；點至九點看書（或文藝書或社會科學書）；九點至十點作文一篇。我這一計劃所以得不到一些成績的理由·第一，誠同先生說的對於看書缺少了研究的「嚴肅性」的緣故。這個緣故，我自己雖也時常覺到「好讀書不求甚解」不去體會書中精緻的藝術的神髓是不好的辦法，於是也曾把一本書讀過三四通的，而結果不但得不到一個深刻的印象，反而趣味淡然，眞像出了氣的啤酒一樣。我也曾看過不少新的文藝書，和看過四五本社會科學書，但留在腦中的是只一團朦朧的印象而已，尤其社會科學如此。不過看這些書的時候相信自己的精神還算專一的，看不懂的大約也不見怎樣的多，然而結果得到的印象祇是這樣，能不使我像着了冷水樣爲之失望嗎？這是我的腦子記憶力衰弱的緣故呢？抑是别的？有什麽方法可以補救嗎？現在我從新打定一個讀書計劃：最重要的不求多讀，而求某一本範書的精髓，關於社會科學的書我選了一册一九三○年北新出版的唯物史覯的社會學，文藝方面長篇有屠塲，短篇有　　，愛的敎育，和自由談上心愛的小品。前者我曾看過幾頁，意思大約還懂得·當時只看了一半，現在我主張重看它的時候，每天至多閱一章，並欲閱完一章做一筆記，以冀多少得到一個明晰的概念。這樣對嗎？至於文藝·我主張不限定時間隨時翻閱，但要研究牠的句法結　如描寫等，極盼先生指示我一個探求的方法。</p>
<p>第二：我旣然有創作的野心，但我這個野心是不大的，只望我能做到一般水凖的　順的文字和能隨意抒寫就是够了。若照我目前的程度看來，離道個目標尙不知幾許路呢。但我的寫作慾非常的强大，每天我都想握起筆來寫作。因我不善取捨材料，和不知如何去描寫，故我的下筆非常遲綏，雖有每天想寫作的野心，然正因爲每天想寫，結果竟幾十天還寫不成一篇短文。這，我自己也知道這個毛病的成因是在於没有把想寫的東西先在腦中構成一個完密的整體，而只有一　若隱若現的印象的緣故。所以在寫時寫了這一點，又把别一點忘了；有些地方是預先没有想到寫的，却在不知不覺間寫上了；有時寫到一半，覺得寫不下去，就盡讀寫好的上文，以引起下文的意緒。所以我的寫文，是完全一邊寫，一邊在想的，没有一次我很快的一口氣寫完過。因之我每篇的稿子總是重改得一塌糊塗，非經重覆抄寫不可（卽是我寫的這封信，亦是如此）這在時間上無謂的損失，實使我痛心！尤其使我痛心的是旣費了極寳貴的時間和精神，而所寫出的東西丨丨不，祗是文字的排列而已丨丨竟毫無生氣，一如泥佛的死板。而習寫至今，不特此習難改，並依然毫無寸進。我有時苦悶得每連擊自己的腦袋，發誓自己不再寫作的時候。不過我的寫作慾太强了，只要過了一天，就又遏止不住的熱情敎我靜心坐下來寫的。但我看人家寫文，揮就好，竟至不要删改一字，看去眞像非常輕易快舉的事。而所寫的文意與佈局的周密，又决非我能做到。這是多麽使我欽羡和自痛呵！先生！你是有文字修養和專門寫作技能的人，望你不吝以你寫時的一點寳貴的經騐，指示我改良這種惡習的途徑吧！</p>
<p>再者：你看了我附上的這一篇隨筆以後，覺得我這個希望丨丨能做到一般水凖的清　文字和隨意抒寫的企圖不大嗎？至於這篇文字内中的描寫句語和結構等如何？要望先生更費心的詳細指示我一下，這，對於我以後的寫作上的帮助是很大的可！（吳鶴生來信）</p>

<h3 id="c188">顯美和獻醜 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 楓子</p>
<p>美，人人所歡迎，醜，人人所厭惡，三五歲的小孩子，一聲被人讚揚美麗時，弱小的心靈，也會掀起愉快的波瀾，更何論涉身社會的大人。不過，美不是人人有的，而是極少數的，醜，却在人羣裏占了極大的地域。因美之難得，所以美的地位也愈高，美之受人歡迎也更强烈。在處身社會的聰明人，如本身無美可找或無美可顯，那總得想些方法變些美出來，交換些光榮。萬一，不幸旣無美反有醜，則將惶惶然寢食難安，亟謀補救之道，如無法可想，至少的限度，總得掩藏起來！否則，蒙一生之恥辱，豈非大愚？</p>
<p>美和醜的界限當然不同，美和醜的性質也没有一定。本身方面有面貌和身體上的美醜，有裝飾和表現上的美醜；環境方面　有名譽上的美醜，有地位上的美醜。前者多數屬於女人，後者多數屬於男子。女人要面貌美麗，身體曲綫，要裝飾摩登化表現時代化，男子要名譽清高地位隆生，那未可以一般的受到特殊歡迎和優越待遇。反之，一切意外的卑視，被棄，甚至不測的禍殃也會輪到頭上。懿歟美哉，人聞無價之寳也。</p>
<p>以上美和醜的界限雖劃然不同，但也得通融借重；如戲台上的　伶可以以男當女，裝模作樣，大都市的男妓可以權充侍夜，搽脂抹紛。如自重的天賦美男子，至少可以在某種塲合下佔先一着。女人也可同樣取巧，生爲無鹽，挽救無方，不妨在名譽上投機，　幾篇詩，寫幾篇文章，擺上優先的招牌丨丨女士；那光榮的頭銜丨丨女詩人，女文學家，不怕没有人拜倒。</p>
<p>所謂地位，本無什麽美和醜，不過有了地位的人，無論男和女，卽使其他皆醜，也可補償得來。不見地位高的老漢可以博得摩登女郎的同情。所以功用是一樣！</p>

<p>丈夫的妻子，阿大篤娘，或者太健康了，生個兒子像生個蛋；然而太忙了，早晨給孩子穿着，給丈夫備早點，更大了肚子上小菜塲；回來後門口告訴隔壁嫂嫂，新開店買了四斤肉，眞便宜！</p>
<p>吃了飯，五百剷是過癮工作，肚子擱到桌邊，撩不着牌時：隔壁嫂嫂不怕累，常常授給她；阿在泥地上打彈子，阿二學吸香烟，阿大同隣孩打出手；伊祗覺煩吵的駡駡小殺千刀外；接着要緊：發財，碰！</p>
<p>在丈夫是缺少不了這個妻子，在孩子，在社會，是否需這般的母親呢？</p>

<p>第二十五回涙陯送人辭家歸遠戍　風沙澈夜出塞駐孤城</p>
<p>不過團長這樣催我回去，必宣前方有了消息，在這種情形之下，大概不是軍人接家眷的時候了。他沉沉的想着，不覺是車子已經到了西直門，座客紛紛下車，他才醒悟過來。由長途汽車而電車，由電車而火車，由火車而又掉到牲口背上，他心裏總横擱下了一個影子，便是桂枝眼眶子裏在流着眼涙，嘴角上還露着笑容。在一個風沙天裏，他趕到了喜峰口了。這天太陽被風沙遮住了，路上不見一點陽光，長空裏泛出那種似黄非黄，似紅非紅的顔色。西北風迎面由天空裏刮過來刮過去，呼呼作嚮。這樣的風沙天，在北方大陸地帶住慣了的人，原也不感到有什麽特别之處。只是在這個地方，却有些不同，遠遠看到萬里長城，在高山巓上，由上而下，由下而上的，拉了一條長線，又隱隱沉沉的，透露在風沙裏，回頭想起那偉大的北京，熟識的海甸，甜美的家庭，這會令人消失了前進的勇氣。但是他如醉如痴的，只認了一條路向前走，總是要繼續的走着。他們是一團人，駐紥在口子裏一所舊營盤裏，自强到了團部門口，見着門外路邊，插着那面團部旗，門口兩位背槍的守衞，和那重灰白的大門院墻，一切荒落悲壯的景象，都在眼裏，覺得這躺回家結婚，猶如一塲幻夢了。他開發了脚夫，自提着行李回連部去。上士王士立見他來了，行過了禮，就握着他的手道：趙連長，你來的眞快。我算着你要到明天早上才能到呢，不想你今天就到。（三二七）</p>

<p>— 陳祺</p>
<p>跑進每個朋友或者親戚家裏，我老是要吃了午飯或是晚飯出來，而且·總聽到朋友親戚們的「待慢」二字客氣話吐露，尤其是女人。</p>
<p>是咱們中國，處處顯得是客氣，也處處可以看到不客氣。</p>
<p>走過馬路上可以看見同是江北弟兄爲了綠燈一開，爭先恐後的互撞了一下車扛，竟破口大駡起來，雖然是爲要先拉到目的地。</p>
<p>再講到「待慢」果然是句極平常的客氣話，但是從這裏可以使我們明瞭古時禮節的隆重，和敬客的恭敬。</p>
<p>可是·仔細想來，那就矛盾了。</p>
<p>假使你是一個窮朋友的話，那就不然，你一脚跨進朋友親戚的門裏，每隻臉孔，都對你嗔怒，像你是他的對頭，或者竟會像怕鬼般的避開你，那時你眞要難堪死了。</p>
<p>要是想揩油頓飯的話，那更是活受罪，不是他們不理會你，就是裝死臉給你看。那麽休說「待慢」二字不會灌進你的耳朶，至少冷話會使你聽到幾句，反之，確實是十足道地的「待慢」。</p>
<p>所以受「待慢」二字，也須有相當的資格咧！</p>
<p>再有·在人家喜慶而邀你去吃酒，大魚大肉，最後·也會從主人口中傳來「待慢」的客氣話。但是，請注意要拿出最少兩元的代價去換來的。</p>
<h3 id="c192">賭 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 時春</p>
<p>世界上有一個著名的賭城，那邊是一個公開的大賭窟，這恐怕有許多人不消說得，都知道是法國的賭城蒙脫卡洛了，好奇的美國電影業並且在幾年之前曾拍攝了一部影片，以賭城爲背景，稱爲蒙脫卡洛的，可見賭城的聲名，遠播於世界各國了。</p>
<p>曾有人說東方也有一個蒙脫卡洛，那就是我們的上海，上海是不是東方的蒙脫卡洛，那自有人評定，也不必我們來多說，但是這賭的一件事情，在上海倒的確是十分流行的，雖然未必有蒙脫卡洛那般的盛，然而比較起來，也可以算算了，蒙脫卡洛是完全依靠了賭的收入來開支市政上費用的，上海未嘗如此，那或者就是上海同賭城的相差之處罷？　　賭這件東西，確然是十分奇怪的，上海的許多大飯店大旅館，一進去以後就可以聽到拍拍之聲，這許多地方，實在也無異於小規模的「蒙脫卡洛」，然而這似乎還是比較文相一些的賭，否則這東方的偉大城市，眞要弄得不可開交，變成蒙脫卡洛第二了。</p>
<p>賭這一種事情，也不知道是什麽時候才開始有的，在我國，賭的一種風氣，由來亦十分久了，我們所知道的，在古時有樗蒲這一種賭具，大概在古時曾經盛行一時，直到現在爲止，所有的賭都總稱爲樗蒲，也有稱爲葉子戲的，所以樗蒲的一種賭具，大約是一種紙牌，又有稱爲博色的，這種賭具在盛行的時候，終在唐朝以前，因爲在史乘上面可以知道，楊貴妃的哥哥楊國忠曾拿樗蒲獻經唐玄宗，唐朝以後，宋元明各朝都有對於樗蒲的禁例，可知古時候的人民未嘗不賭，也未嘗不嗜賭而經朝庭的禁止馬吊也是古時賭具的一種，有的以爲就是現在的麽雀，但事實上麻雀在太平天國之後才盛行於各地，雀戰一事，說起來實在是洪秀全所發明的，太平天國時，天王占據金陵，那時城外被清兵圍住，城内守門不出，經過了很久，相持不下，南京城裏有田，糧食不恐慌，因之安然受圍，但城中非常寂寞，没有事情可以做，於是發明了麻雀，互相消遣，本來祇有一百零八隻，以梁山泊有一百零八人做牌面，後來又加了二十八隻，於是成功了現在的一百三十六隻。</p>

<p>— 佩萸</p>
<p>假使你的家庭裏舉行宴會，到的賓客很多，你做主人的，一定要想些新穎有趣的娱樂方法，使賓客們覺得興趣盎然，歡樂無窮。否則，雖你竭力招待，十分周到，祗有談談講講，走走坐坐，吃吃喝喝，唱唱跳跳，總是冷清寡歡，不大熱閙。這裏有幾種建議，貢獻給讀者諸君，想必歡迎的。</p>
<p>餅乾賽跑</p>
<p>這是一種無需音樂演奏，而有比賽性質的團體遊戲；也是宴會中最有趣最簡便的娱樂方法之一。方法是這樣：把賓客分爲兩隊，每隊的人數要相同，對面分列兩行。假定每隊的人數是十人，那麽主人與主婦，各取一盆，盆中放餅乾十片，分立於每隊左首第一人的對面。一切都凖備之後，參加比賽的隊員，兩手放在背面，禁止伸前，更不能交頭接耳，任意談話了。由主人或主婦發令，喊一二三，「三」字的喊聲止後，主人和主婦，各自盆中拿起一塊餅乾，送到隊左第一人的嘴裏敎他吃，然後拿起第二塊餅乾，向右移步，立在第二人的面前預備着。隊左第一人見餅乾入口，趕快咬嚼，愈快愈妙。餅乾嚼碎嚥下吃完以後，轉過頭向右，對着第二人張口；這時主人或主婦應當趕快把第二塊餅乾送進第二人的嘴裏去。第二人吃完了，也照第一人般的關照第三人。如此的自左至右，依次而吃，那一隊先吃畢，就是勝利者。</p>

<p>這也是一種很有趣味的比賽遊戲。參加比賽的人，至少要有十個，另有一人做發號記錄者。參加的十人，平均分爲兩隊，對面而立，中間相距十餘步。事前做主人的應預備大小硬度和撲克牌相仿的白紙二十張，分爲兩套，每套的白硬紙，是從零到九的號碼：就是第一張的白硬紙上，寫一個「零」字，第二張上寫「一」字，第三張上寫「二」字，第四張上寫「三」字，第五張上寫「四」字，第六張上寫「五」字，第七張上寫「六」字，第八張上寫「七」字，第九張上寫「八」字，第十張上寫「九」字。另備一張白紙，鉛筆一枝，作記分數用，由發號記錄者管理。號碼紙每隊拿一套，分給自己一隊的隊員，號碼要依自左至右的次序，就是左首第一人拿「零」號，末一人拿「九」號。每人要雙手拿號碼紙，放在胸前，號碼之字向外，暗暗記牢·不准臨時偷視。分派立齊之後，發號記錄者拿本電話號碼簿來，隨意揀一個没有同字的號碼，高聲喊出。例如喊的是五七三九，那麽兩隊中拿這號碼人，走前兩步，依電話號碼的次序，排列而向左看齊，那一隊的隊員先成行列而無錯誤，勝一分。發號記錄者記下分數後，走出隊伍的人重去依次歸隊。假使預定舉行五次比賽，那麽比賽完畢，看總分那一隊所得的多，就是勝利者。</p>
<p>動作猜謎</p>
<p>這種遊戲，對於人數少的塲所，最爲相宜。先把賓客分爲兩個團體。一個團體留在室内，呌做猜的團體；個團體走到室外去，呌做做的團體，費幾分鐘的時間，商量一句字數不多而可用動作來表明的字句。商定之後，一起回至室内，各人做出不同的動作來。例如這一團體所定的字句是「裝飾」二字，那麽在這團體中的分子，走進室内後，向猜的一個團體，說明是兩個字的句子，然後做出動作來。或者把兩手擦面而作拍粉狀；或者把衣服的紐扣解鬆。拉拉揮揮，重行紐好，作穿衣狀；或者把一足踏上椅子，把皮鞋的帶子結結好；或者把頭上的頭髮；用手梳梳好；諸如此類的動作，敎那一個團體看了去猜。假使猜的一個團體，在三分鐘内，猜不出是甚麽［麽字句，那麽做的一個團體，再退出室内，另商一句字句，再進來表演。若是這次被那猜的一個團體猜中了，那麽猜中的一個團體走到室外去商量字句，進來表演，敎方才做的一個團體猜。如此你猜我做·我猜你　做·輪流行之。頗饒興味。</p>

<p>雙方新將出塲表演减色</p>
<p>東華前鋒仍銳獲勝歸來</p>
<p>頗爲一般人注目之東華曁南在西聯甲組足球中、第二次相逢之結果、東華以三比零戰勝曁南、復仇上次二比零失敗於曁南之辱、雙方皆因前日一戰之困疲、以新將補充陣綫、但曁南前鋒自較東華减色、故進攻方面、不若東華銳利、九十分鐘强半處於東華壓迫之下、然昨戰殊爽利可觀、雙方極能遵守體育道德、爲年來華人比賽中罕見之吉光、上半時東華以二對○先佔優勢、下半時曁南反攻無效、又失一城、綜計東華以三對○奏凱、</p>
<p>李中鋒足下不留情開球之後、　　東華卽取絶對攻勢、李義臣統率賈萬、節節進迫、顧尙勷二次營救險球、萬象華三打祝家莊、沿邊直下、勢如疾風暴雨、邢漢傑撲面迎來、小萬乘覺、勾與周光中、乘勢進窺曁南腹地、陳春秀與周洪倫禮襄爲國、致被賈幼良得隙挑送中樞、李義臣撒開飛毛大腿、對門搗去、小賴側身跌倒、依然不能免此大難、於是紀錄遂開、</p>
<p>陳洪光隔山開砲東華得一球後、聲勢愈見猛厲、顧尙勷雖然能作中流砥柱、惜一木難支大厦、是故曁南後防、人影紛亂、險象環生、周洪倫與陳春秀、二枝精兵、處在四面楚歌之下、有翅難飛、周光中渾如獅子盤球、全身解數、萬象華有空卽鑽、確是危險人物、羅海光猶思背城借一、無奈掝擋非人、反予東華以隙、陳洪光在二十五碼處、力射一記、捲入網窩、成二對○、</p>
<p>曁南反攻無效果　休息時過、對調陣地、羅海光與顧尙勷統率大小三軍、預備滅此朝食、進襲之聲勢、有若萬馬奔騰、劉始贊脚頭生硬、得機不能建樹、命也如何、張洪藻近門咫尺、依然白乎歸來、引得觀衆不勝慨嘆、此時丁吳兩前衞已奉命撤回三道防綫、周賢言生意興隆逆來順受、二十分鐘内、弄丸戲月、幸無大禍發生、</p>
<p>義臣造成直落三　陳公嶼雖係東將出身、然其脚頭之硬、殊足使人驚訝、當頭一棒、皮球飛過半塲、東華前鋒、至此又呈活躍、陳周兩後衞無法擋駕、時時逼成角球、幸小萬足軟無力、未能操刀直入、迨末後三分鐘、李義臣混入虎口、横身射掃、賴作榮無法得脫此刦、遂以三對○敗北、</p>

<h3 id="c226">中國棉紗業的危機 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 維祺</p>
<p>棉紗業爲我國現時最大工業之一，其資本約有一萬三千萬元之鉅，使用工人達十萬以上，依販運棉花棉紗棉布以生活之大中小商人爲數更夥；况棉紗爲棉織品之原料，而棉織品又爲我國廣大民衆日常生活所不可或缺之必需品，丨丨這只要看我國每年進口貨物，以棉貨棉紗爲大宗，便可知道。不僅如此，就政府的財政收入，於棉紗統稅一項，也爲其最重要財源之一，年達二千萬元以上；故棉紗業之興衰，與國計民生至有關係，已不待言。然中國華商紗廠，近年以來因外受世界經濟恐慌帝國主義洋紗洋布輸入傾銷之影響，内受在華外商紗廠之競爭傾軋，及連年天災人禍之襲擊，致農村經濟崩潰購買力銳减，市塲衰落，銷路停滯，陷全國紗廠於不能繼續維持之危局。這些一切，現在已成爲儼然的事實，而非理論的問題了。</p>
<p>關於中國棉紗業危機的原因，據我個人觀察所得，大約有下面諸點：</p>
<p>（一）原棉不足　棉紗之原料爲棉花，而其製品爲棉布，這是誰都知道的。故棉紗業之興衰，恒看棉價與紗價高低爲轉移。若棉賤紗貴則獲利而興，棉貴紗賤則虧折而衰。我國棉花以前向極便宜，不僅足用，且爲土産出口之大宗；但自民國八年以來，一方面因國内紗廠日增，另一方面因播種面積及收穫額增加甚微，致本國之棉花反不足以供各紗廠之需求，而不得不每年輸進大量高價的外棉了。本來自國原棉不足，使用外國原棉，與紗業之興衰是没有十分關係的。如日本就是一例。但中國産業落後，技術幼稚，資本薄弱，事事後人，畢竟不能與日本相比。所恃者僅爲廉價的勞動力，和低價的原料。現原棉旣告不足，使用外國輸入高價的原料，所以卽時成爲問題了。况近年以來，金貴銀賤，入口課稅等等，更加使製成的商品加重成本費。不僅如此，外棉輸入還可以直接破壞中國農村經濟，致農民購買力减少，影響棉紗棉布之銷路。故原棉不足，實爲我國棉紗業危機的最根本原因之一。茲將最近十年間我國棉産供給與消費情形列表於下以資參考。（播種面積以畝爲單位，其他以担爲單位）</p>
<p>年　次　播種面積　　國内産棉　　外棉進口　供給共計　紗廠消費</p>
<p>十二年　二九、五五四、○五三　八、三一○、三五五　　　六三九、七九七　八、九五○、一五二　　六、○三三　○○○</p>
<p>十三年　二九　七七一、五七七　七、一四四、六四二　　　一六一、八六二　七、三○六、五○四　　五、八九一、○○○</p>
<p>十四年　二八、一二一、○二七　七、八○八、八八二　一、○○六、六一八　八、八一五、五○○　　六、○三七、○○○</p>
<p>十五年　二七、三四九　七二七　七、五三四、三五一　一、八六六、五○五　九、四○○、八五六　　六、五八一、○○○</p>
<p>十六年　二七、六一○、二七六　六、二四三、五八五　　　九六八、五三二　七、二一二、一一七　　七、二○○、○○○</p>

<p>（二）中國棉質粗劣　中國的棉花，不僅産額不足供需求，就其品質也很粗劣，不適於紡製細紗及雙股綫之用。這從上表看來也很明白，卽中國的紗廠消費棉量並没有驚人的增加，而國内棉産額也没有急激的低落；但海關進口的外棉却有急速度的增大，其中尤以美棉及埃及棉爲最。這是因美棉及埃及棉盡屬細絨的緣故。我國近年難盡量輸入良好美種，但因棉農缺乏智識，不知選種留良之法，致原來纖維較長之美種，經過數年後，也逐漸退化，而變爲粗劣。據調查結果，這種纖維較長之棉花産額，民國十八年爲二·○七九·五四三担，十九年爲三·一六九·八八九担，二十年爲二·五二三·六五○担，二十一年爲三·○六五·九九五担，平均起來，每年尙不及三百萬担，而這三百萬担當中，因棉商攙粗的關係，致實際能供細紗之用者，殆不過其半額，卽一百五十萬担，以之與目前國内所出之細紗數量比較，相差實遠；於是一般紗廠便不得不採用美棉和埃及棉以補其不足了。茲將最近四年來國内紗廠銷用各種棉花之比率列表於下：</p>
<p>年　次　中　棉　美棉棉　印度棉　埃及　其他</p>

<p>（三）受外紗外布傾銷之壓迫中國以前因受恊定關稅之束縛，致進口外貨不能自由增稅以保護本國之工業，現在關稅雖已收回自主了；但是實際離保護還是很遠。一般說來，中國的關稅比其他各國仍是很低；且近年來，全世界資本主義國家皆受空前的經濟恐慌襲擊，生産堆如山，欲投往外國，則又爲關稅障壁所阻；於是只得向産業比較落後的關稅比較低廉的中國大量傾銷了。試看中國進口之外貨逐年增大，便可知道。茲錄民國十年以來棉織品及棉紗部分的數字於下以資證明。（單位海關兩）</p>

<p>註：上表中應該特别注意的是：棉紗部分自民國十一年以後逐漸减少者，係因外商在華設廠傾銷所致。</p>
<p>（四）受在華外商紗廠傾銷之壓迫　中國的棉紗業，不僅受國外棉紗棉布輸入傾銷之壓迫，同時且受在華外商紗廠傾銷之壓迫。中國因爲受不平等條約之束縛，所以各帝國主義者能够自由在中國設立工廠。帝國主義者在中國設立工廠，約有下面諸點利益；一、利用獸廉價的勞動力；一一、利用中國低價的原料；三、製品銷賣中國免負關稅及運輸船舶等費。現在帝國主義在中國設立的工廠，首推紗廠，而其中尤以日本爲第一，英國次之。據實業部調查，中國境内的日商紗廠，總共有四十三家，資本達一、○七八、○○○、○○○元，紗錠數達一、五八二、○五六枚。又據另一調查，英國在中國境内的紗廠，共有四家，資本二○、○○○、○○○元，紗錠二○五、三二○枚。這樣看來，在中國棉紗市場上起重大作用者只有日本。日本帝國主義者向來就以傾銷侵略中國爲一貫的政策，經過九一八及一二八兩次事變中國民衆嚴厲抵制後，雖稍微受了打擊；但他們爲突破這一難關，也就更進一步的貶價傾銷，以打破中國之抵貨防綫，奪回中國的市塲。然他們在中國所設立的紗廠每年産額究有多少呢？試看下表便可知道。</p>

<p>註；從民國十二年至十九年止的數字，係根據中國紗廠聯合會調查，棉紗以包爲單位，棉布以疋爲單位。二十年和二十一年係根據中國銀行調查，棉紗以包爲單位，棉布以件爲單位。</p>
<p>（五）資本薄弱全國華商紗廠共有八十二家，紗錠二、五二二、三○○枚；雖比日商在華紗廠多三十九家，紗錠多九四○、二四四枚；但資本却不是正比例的增多，而是反比例的减少，卽華商紗廠總共僅有一三○、○○○、○○○元資本。日商在華紗廠每錠占六百八十餘元，而華商紗廠則每錠僅不過占五十餘元。因此，華商紗廠往往事業大於資本，致金融周轉極度困難。倘一旦遇着外貨外商競爭，銷路停滯，貸借不來，便卽時倒閉，宣告破産了。</p>
<p>（六）技術幼稚華商紗廠不僅資本薄弱，就技術也很幼稚。比如在華日商紗廠紡二十文紗，每萬錠僅用二百四十工人，而華商紗廠同樣紡二十支紗，每萬錠則非用三百五十至七百五十工人不可。故華商紗廠紗錠及雇用工人雖多於在華日商紗廠；但産額則增加甚微·致成本費非常之大。不僅如此，且所出的貨品，也都大半參差不齊，成色較劣。</p>
<p>（七）金融资体不與合作　中國紗廠資本薄弱已如上述，但若有金融資本爲其後盾與之合作</p>
<p>，則尙不難勉强支持，渡過現時的難關。然中國的金融資本對於工業投資，向來並没有若何重視，只熱中於公債及地産，雖有一部分金融资本也爲工業所利用；但因市塲利息較高，條件非常苛刻，其利息每月甚至有一分四五釐者。故這樣與其說放欵救濟中國工業，不如說是剥削摧殘中國工業。然中國金融資本對於纱廠放欵的情形怎樣呢？據上海商業儲蓄銀行和中國銀行最近二年度的營業報告，上海商業儲蓄銀行二十年度放欵於工業者，總共二千三百餘萬元，占放欵總額百分之三四·三○·其中紡織業占工業放欵百分之四二·七八·二十一年度對紡織業放欵總額爲一千四百餘萬兩，較三十年度約增百分之四二。中國銀行二十年度放欵於工業者，總共三千三百六十七萬四千九百二十五元，占放欵總額百分之一○·一四·其中紗廠占工業放欵百分之四七·九·二十一年度對工業放欵，總共三千八百四十三萬五千四百二十三元，較二十年度增七百二十三萬七千七百六十九元，占放欵總額百分之一一·四六·其中紗廠占工業放欵百分之六一·九。這些數字，中國銀行還很滿意的說；「對於工業已頗盡了維護之責」了。但實際，因利息之高和其他金融資本之不願放欵給紗廠，對於紗廠本身可說仍是很少裨益。</p>
<p>（八）農村經濟崩潰農民購買力銳减　棉紗棉布雖爲農民日常生活的必需品；然因歷年以來，外受帝國主義之侵略，内受大小軍閥之摧殘剥削，及天災匪患之破壞襲擊，致農村日趨崩潰，農民購買力錢减，棉紗銷路停滯。因爲中國的棉紗不像生絲一樣，是以國外市塲爲主國内市塲爲副，恰恰相反，中國棉紗差不多是靠國内市塲；故農村經濟崩潰農民購買力减少，對於中國棉紗業，便成爲致命的打擊了。</p>
<p>（九）銷賣市塲縮小　所謂銷賣市塲縮小，便是指失去東北四省而言。自從九一八事變，日本帝國主義先後以武力强佔我東北四省後，不僅失去廣大的土地，豐富的資源，就貿易上也因日本帝國主義鐵蹄所到，而幾乎全部獨占了。且成立所謂滿洲國後，更自由設立稅關規定稅率重徵中國本部進口的商品稅。於是向爲消納中國本部輕工業製品的東北廣大市塲，近來輸往的貨物竟見大减。别的我們暫且不說，現單就棉貨一項而論吧！棉織品由事變後二十年度的一千一百六十萬兩减至前年度的八百三十萬兩；棉紗由二千萬兩减至四百九十萬兩，而去年及今年以後則更必减少無疑。故失去東北市塲，實爲搆成現時中國棉紗業危機的最主要原因之一。</p>
<p>（十）國家保護不周　一國工業之發達，端賴國家强力之保護與援助，已成定論，尤其是産業落後的國家工業，更非如此不可。我國政府過去固不用說，就現在也尙脫不上保護。比如在華外商紗廠購棉賣紗，一稅之後，卽可通行全國，而華商紗廠則不能如此，内地各省苛捐雜稅，至今存在者尙多。又如民國二十年二月所施行的棉紗統稅稅則，因條約關係不能獨惠於華商紗廠，而一律待遇；然實際則仍是與在華外商紗廠以有利。此外尙有許許多多，眞是不勝枚舉，然就此已可窺見政府保護棉紗業不周之一斑了。</p>
<p>除此以外，如機器之陳舊，産銷之不合理化，以及紗廠當局眼光之淺短不知團結，皆無一不足以搆成危機；然因篇幅有限，恕不述說了。</p>
<h3 id="c227">棉花分級與紡織業之關係 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 狄建菴</p>
<p>棉花分級之最大目的，爲供給紡織業採用之便利，而少無謂之虧損。英雖非産棉國，而言倡棉花品級標凖，紡織業憑藉標凖以採購原棉，無不適合其需要，故其紡織業之發達，爲世界冠。吾國號稱世界第三産棉國，而棉花分級尙付闕如。故雖有良棉，因無相當保護。常致湮没；劣棉則觸目皆是，其有碍吾國紡織業之發展，關係匪淺。年來紡織廠感於外棉品質優良，易於採購，對國棉日益厭棄。以致外棉進口日衆，國棉價格低賤，農村破産，紗銷遂滯，結果紡織業棉商棉農交受其困。欲圖挽救，非提倡棉花分級不可；欲提倡棉花分級，又非紡織業一致努力不可。吾國因素無棉花分級之詳細規定，各紡織廠咸以一己之利益爲依歸；凡購進原棉·惡有罰而善不賞，貪圖一時小惠而遺害於無窮。蓋紗廠收棉，不依照棉花分級方法，其結果非特紗廠自危，産棉區域，亦蒙極大之損害。舉例以言，民國十年前太倉北部咸産黑籽棉，棉農均肯勤加剔選，品質潔白優美，可紡二十支左右之紗，絶爲無錫上海等紗廠所賞識，紛紛在太設立辦花處，惜收貨者不知奬優罰劣，常玩弄棉農於股掌之上，忠實者雖有良棉，而每無高價可得，狡黠者售棉雖絶低劣，亦能得相當之價値，一任收貨者上下其手，壟斷取巧，農民自不願勤加剔選，而亦同流合汚。不數年間良棉漸消，品質日低，紡紗支數亦日粗劣。廠方固受害非淺，重者宣告營業停頓，或將辦花處收束，然太倉棉産亦爲之蹂躪無遺，欲恢復以前榮譽，非易易矣。又前年安慶裕中紗廠之倒閉，其重大原因，卽爲收進原棉，騐貨不公平·狡黠棉商施行賂賄，雖極惡劣之棉，濫收無限，致引起一部分公正之憤慨，將其所收棉花直接運至上海等地出售，不願售於裕中。該廠旣以劣棉紡紗紗質惡劣，銷路自呆，甚至有不能舉以紡紗，欲購較佳之棉花，當地己不可得，反須向上海購進，成本因之昻貴，致遭破産之危險。諸如此類，不勝枚舉。故年來紡織業衰落，影響於全國經濟之崩潰，實以紡織廠對於原棉不知分級爲最大之病源。夫在收棉時，祗顧棉價之合算；不詳細計其品質之優劣，良棉價格不易提高，劣棉則反享不應得之便宜，棉商棉販及棉農，遂毫不以改良棉産爲念，反日趨於作僞之一途。紡織業每痛心疾首，於國棉品質拙劣·而不知國棉品質之不佳，皆由各廠商用人不當，選擇不公，有以促成之耶，人應責廠商之自作孽，爲吾國平添漏巵，反以尤人怨物，抑何不明之甚也。茲述其原因如下。</p>
<p>（一）紡織業缺乏聯絡無公訂之標凖　各廠騐貨員祗憑一已之經騐，能辨别棉品爲已足，從無互相聯絡！交換各人之經騐，公訂統一之標準，致騐貨員能力有高低深淺之不同，予棉商以可乘之機，從中作癑弊。</p>
<p>（二）紗價低落之牽制　紗價低落而與原棉價格不合，收貨員祗迎合業主之心理，不能以高價收良棉，但關棉格之合算，濫收次貨，似便宜而實吃虧，影響紗質之劣次，及廢棉之增多，結果反較購買良棉損失爲大。</p>
<p>（三）收貨員之扯價　紡織廠派出之收貨員或辦花處，均受有廠方之限價，故抑優助劣以求其扯價之平衡，影響於日後該處之棉産前途，在所不顧。例如市塲上普通之棉價爲四十元：如遇上等棉，雖其貨應加出三元，而收貨者祗加二元，反之如遇次等之棉，雖其貨應減去三元，但收貨者祗減二元，以便扯合其價値，致衣棉毫無保障，漸趨低劣。</p>
<p>（四）期棉無合理之處置　紡織廠與棉商間，常有限貨之契約，其價格一經訂立得後在收貨時，如棉花市價較訂定後爲低，廠方每有多方挑剔，如退貨重磅扣水氣等，以補其所受之損失。反之則棉商亦有不講信用，以劣棉抵解，遂致糾紛時起。但棉商若以良棉抵解，廠方格於定價，若欲照原價加出若干，亦爲不可能之事，致有罰惡而不賞善之譏。</p>
<p>（五）貿易上之爭奪　在棉花原質市塲良棉不易得較高價値者，另一原因，則爲同業之爭相收買，苟有一家對於良棉特出高價，别家往往不知就裏，誤爲放價，爲求其門市之發達；不問良棉與否，濫放價格，因此閙大市面，各受損失，故棉商對於良棉，亦覺愛莫能助，因此良棉減少。</p>
<p>（六）營私舞弊之行爲　紡織廠騐貨員，每有私受賣方之賄賂，或情面上之牽制，騐貨時因人而異，無一定之方針，其中因而發生操縱壓迫等事，忠厚之棉商，雖執有良棉，祗以不善鑽營，其售價常在普通棉價之下，反使奸刁之棉商詐得高價，自詡基其能，遂使忠厚之棉商日少，而羣趨於奸刁之一途，此節影響於吾國棉花品質之改進甚大。</p>
<p>上述各種原因，爲紡織廠不可避免之事實。故吾國紡織業除去上項弊病，而圖營業之發達者，非　一致提倡棉花分級不可。</p>
<p>上海商品檢騐局對於吾國棉花分級，早已注意；曾參考美國棉花品級標凖辦法，採集各地棉樣，從事研究，將全國棉産通盤籌劃，依照歷年研究結果，試定標凖。同在一種學理之下，而有類别級别之分，褒優貶劣，使各地棉花均得有相當之價値，可處理棉花賣買手續，維持商業上之公平，並可提高品質，發展棉業前途。棉花之類别，依據品種及品質之不同，暫分六類：卽長絨美種棉，短絨美種棉，黑籽中棉，白籽中棉，粗絨棉，特粗棉是。至於級别，概分爲五級，並附以四個半級，卽第一級爲優級，第二級爲上級，第三級爲中級，第四級爲下級，卽第五級爲劣級是也。棉絲長度，另有長度標凖之規定，考察吾國棉花市塲，以美種棉中級長度在英寸八分之七者爲基本標凖品：（暗指鄭州棉紡二十支原料爲凖），則各地棉花，視其等級之高低，棉絲之長短，依照基本標凖而加减。以定其相當之價値。例如美種棉不論其爲何地所産，如其品級及長度均較基本標凖爲高，應得高價之利，倘其品級及長度均較基本標凖爲低，亦應相當减價，雖同爲一地所産之棉，照其質地之高低，均有不同之價値，（該局有試訂棉花標凖之加减表可以參考）其便利於紡織業之需要，不可限量。且其分級之條件，視棉中色澤之優劣，夾雜物之多寡，軋工之良窳而分。故高級棉花，紗質優良，廢棉减少，低級棉花，紗質窳劣，廢花增加，均與紡織上有密切之關係。棉花類别及棉絲之長度，與紡紗支數有相聯之關係。紡織業採用此種標凖，熟諳分級之方法，則一切問題，自可迎刃而解·如欲紡何種之紗，宜用何級之貨，調配便利，少無謂之消耗。訂定期貨時，可指明何類何級之棉，用何價格，成立議單，倘棉商在交貨時，品級程度較所指明之品級爲高，廠方應按級照加其價値，反之則應按級减低，此種交易，方爲合理。至於市價之漲落，係另一問題，賣買雙方，均不得因受損失而有自私不顧公理之行爲，且棉花品級，將來政府必有法規，棉商應有棉花品級檢騐委員會之設立也·其在棉商棉農方面，能引起整理棉花之與趣，而有向上之途徑，凡調製選擇等工作，必能逐漸改良，則棉質之提高，指日可待。良棉受品級之保護；有高價可得，則植棉事業，必能隨之而進展。我國棉産之「質」「量」問題，可不待煩言而决，最近全國經濟委員會棉業統制委員會，亦有推廣棉花分級之計畫；實爲發展棉業之先决問題，紡織業居棉業最高之地位，而與此種棉花分級有如此密切之關係，盍與政府合作以圖之乎？</p>

<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>醫學醫德問題。年來甚囂塵上。知者言之。識者辨之。而仁智各見。盡人不能身體而力行也。此醫之恥也。雖然。染化未久。不成風敎。自昔己然。苟得莊嶽之冶陶。什百年後。未嘗不可　化。學兄宋國賓氏。曩三致意於醫德。並有醫師倫理學之巨著。實維醫界風敎之先聲。自不可以尋常言論目之。識者以爲其功亦不在禹下也。惟是濁世滔滔。權利是攘。君子縱明利義之辨。而不能擯權利之爭。慨彼寂滅無爲。猶且苦離擺脫。而况紅塵十丈。出入貨殖塲中之我醫。此柳下之所以可貴也。日前宋氏醫師五權一說。乃繼醫師倫理之作。蓋誅心之言也。其實道德倫理本旨。絶非人生權利對稱之義務。乃天地間。圓顱方趾。應盡之責職。應踐之途徑。應就之範圍。應具之觀念。初非因對象之權利。而始履行。是故與法有間也。醫師倫理。雖不同凡衆。然其綱領。則天經地義。不外倫常原則。似不可以拘束於醫師職務。而偏解爲權利之代價。茲就法律點立論。醫師因受法律拘束。卽當履行法律上義務。同時又得法律保障。卽可取得法律上權利。是權利義務。有相對鉗制。相對維護之特性。存乎其間。所以法律。有暗寓補救道德之點。而絶非道德構成。從來論法者。以爲法律。爲補救道德不足而設。其實道德完備。亦當有法。再申言之。道德爲人生必由之路。而法律則貴在備而不用。因是。道德上之義利。如東西兩端之趨向。而法律上之義利。爲人欲屈伸之主張。固不可以相提並論者也。不佞讀宋氏五權之說。深感非對德之論。實就法而言。因再舉其法律上數權。以爲補遺。宋氏具不非我言乎。</p>
<p>（一）有使用麻醉品之權　如鴉片嗎啡海洛因以及土的年等。所謂法律上禁用之麻醉品。在一班人民。不特不得應用。抑且不准販賣。而醫師。任意與人内服。卽爲應用。人方配售與人。無異販賣。然則何以獨擅此權而不禁。曰限於善意的治人病。解人痛苦。</p>
<p>（二）有使用利器切割人體之權凡用一種器物。加諸他人。而使其體部損傷者。刑法上。當科以傷害罪。而况利器。當醫師。則執刀持剪。任意湔腸伐明。剖腹解顱。殆盡人間之殘酷行爲而不禁。何以故。曰限於善意的治人病。解人痛苦。</p>
<p>（三）有監禁並侵奪人自由之權　醫師。有禁止病人外出自由行動之權。此不但對精神病者而言。卽一班患病者。在相當適需條件之下。亦可監視其行動。侵奪其自由。若整形外科範圍。則不啻更加桎梏於其身矣。在如此臨近威脅暴行。而不加制裁者何也。曰限於善意的治人病。解人痛苦。</p>
<p>（四）有墮胎之權　對於懷孕之婦女。用藥物。及其他方法。使墮其胎者。觸犯刑章。而醫師。則得隨時執行此種行爲而不禁。何也。曰限於善意的保持母體安全。或對其所患疾病上有昨而出此。</p>
<p>（五）有猥褻行爲之權　稱猥褻行爲者。包括販賣。或陳列猥褻而有傷風化之文書圖畫。以及暴露陰部。或加以非法的動作。又乘心神喪失。或抗拒不能時。而加以猥褻行爲者。例有相當之罪責。而醫師則書有生殖生理。生殖病理。圖有交媾受精。與夫婦産科之檢視陰户。另以探索。有不能檢。或必動手術時。施用麻醉。可使心神喪失。抗拒不能。而强力行之。然則同一猥褻行動。而獨於醫師不禁者。何也。曰限於善意的研究學術。解人痛苦。</p>
<p>此外尙有傷害屍體等特權。不一而足。在常人行之。均足致罪召禍。故守法奉公者。恒戰慄恐懼。惴惴焉。惟避免之不遑。而獨我醫。則悍然爲之。非醫師之無上威權。無非尊嚴耶。今試反求其身。而觀察之。權貴跋扈。則亂國。醫師跋扈。則害人。所謂大盜不操弧矛。最足令人警惕而深戒也。顧予之作是篇也。以爲宋氏五權說。乃對於醫師切身之權利而作。予之所補五權說。乃醫師超越刑法之特權立論。然皆據法理而言。非倫常本旨也。然則醫師努力公衆衞生。解除人類痛苦。果爲此前五權後五權之代價乎。是難言矣。至若道德倫理。雖亦爲人爲之學。第每有不待人爲。而發自天性者。烏鳥知孝。羔羊感恩。物且如此。而况吾人。故吾謂言倫理者。不當以權利義務並論也。質諸宋氏。以爲如何。</p>

<p>— 瞿紹衡</p>
<p>（二）局部療法　局部外傷。須極度開放。將膿汁壞組織及異物完全搔去後。用碘酒塗布或雙養水或「配兒白兒洒姆」（ＢalsamumPerurinum）洗滌。再以五○丨一○○單位之抗毒素充塡之。此外尙有百分之○·五丨○·七五石炭酸水繼續溶及創傷部人工高山太陽燈照射在法。惟腐蝕法則古雖賞用。今已列爲禁例矣。</p>
<p>（三）血清療法　抗毒素血清。視其注射方法。而治療功果不同。</p>
<p>注射之法。分皮下注射。靜脈注射。動脈注射。神經内注射。腦内注射。及脊髓膜下注射六種。其選擇當隨醫師之觀察而定之。但腦内及脊髓内注射時。須先排出新欲注射血清同量之腦脊髓液。其用量。腦脊髓内。每次一○○丨一五○單位。靜脈内每次一○○丨三○○單位。神經内每次一○○單位。</p>
<p>（四）藥物療法　抱水　「克老拉兒」（Ｃhlorafmnhydralmu）灌腸。一日五次。每次一公分。「哄脫碰」（Ｐontopon）或嗎啡皮下注射。一日數次。每次○·○二。「威老那兒」（Ｖeronal）「魯咪那兒」（Ｌuminal）皮下注射。一日五次。每次○·四。「奴麽兒」（Ｎumal"Roche"）内　　一日五次　每次一錠　（每錠含量○·○六）百分之十五硫酸鎂溶液靜脈或臀筋内注射。每日二丨三次。每次一○西西。病症危篤者。可以該液一○西西注射於腰椎腔内。注射後經過三十分鐘。而不見筋之弛緩者。則將頭部放低。若注射硫酸鎂後。發生呼吸麻痺之危象。則以生理的食鹽水將腰椎腔洗滌之。並用百分之五鹽化鈣靜脈注射。呼吸困難者。行氣管切開及酸素吸入。</p>
<p>對於初生兒破傷風。除臍帶消毒外。抱水「克老拉兒」瀝腸。一日二丨三次。每次。·二五丨○·五。格魯仿（Chloroform）吸入。臭素劑内服。在最初二四丨二八小時内。以破傷風抗毒素五○單位注射於臍之周圍。五○單位注射於脊髓硬膜下。百分之四硫酸鎂溶液五西西皮下注射。第一日二次。其後每日一次。</p>
<p>余有姪女。自幼從余習醫。長適陸行謝氏。生一子。題名宗玄。僅七月而夭喪所。悲痛欲絶。姑念幼子在抱。克繼香烟。聊以自慰。乃善爲保育。愛如掌珠。年方七齡。能解詩文。見者莫不稱羡。謂謝氏有後矣。民國二十一年十月某日。手携玻璃瓶遊戲於門前之院中。偶倒地。瓶碎傷手。流血甚多。乃母卽爲之用藥包裹。越七日。因事至我家。日間尙與羣兒遊戲。至傍晚有微熱。及午夜。則熱高。而忽現牙關緊急之象。乃母卽疑爲破傷風病。然因鄉居。又値半夜。無醫可請。無藥可用。不得已。坐待天明。送入上海醫院。啓視傷部。則腐臭不可聞矣。檢之。因見破傷風菌。卽行注射血清。卒歸無效。按幼兒倒地受傷。事屬尋常。然因因受傷而闢破傷風菌侵入之門户。遂致不救。雖曰天命。實亦誤於最初處置之不善耳。余以有感乎中。乃作是篇。以儆世人。</p>
<h3 id="c238">疾病常識問答 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（二）（十）（五）格魯布性肺炎（續）</p>
<p>（問）格魯布性肺炎，在他的病狀和經過中，有那幾種變型？</p>
<p>（答）有種種變型：像中心性肺炎，逍遙性肺炎，酒客肺炎，無力性肺炎，小兒肺炎，老人肺炎等。</p>
<p>（問）中心性肺炎是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）中心性肺炎，病狀和普通型一樣；但病竈却限局於肺門部而不達邊緣。</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做逍遙性肺炎？</p>
<p>（答）就是說那肺炎的病竈部分，從肺葉移行到他肺葉的意思。所以病狀陸續不絶的消長，於是病勢的經過，要遷延很長久的時日了。</p>
<p>（問）酒客肺炎，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>答酒客肺炎，經過中現很重篤的病狀。他們在疾病的初期，已經訴强度的全身倦怠，陷於譫妄，手指震顫，見種種小動物等幻覺。大都取死亡的途徑。</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做無力性肺炎？</p>
<p>（答）病人衰弱很甚，口唇和舌都乾燥，肌肉震顫，陷於昏迷，經過非常重篤。有種種熱型，喀痰往往没有鐵銹色，又有缺乏痰液的。又有像傷寒症那樣有脾腫，蛋白尿和鼓腸等症狀。有現黄疸的。</p>
<p>（問）小兒肺炎怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）發病時並不以戰慄開始：但往往發劇甚的譫妄和痙攣，喀痰很少。預後，普通是佳良的。</p>
<p>（問）老人肺炎怎樣？</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>（答）發病起始很緩和：發熱較少，但心臟容易衰弱，危險很大。</p>
<p>問在什麽時候，格魯布性肺炎不現定型的病狀？</p>
<p>（答）在病人有心臟病，肺氣腫，腎臟病，脂肪過多症的存在時，不現定型的病狀。若已患消損病的人，早期就有心臟衰弱的危險。</p>
<p>（問）本病在經過中，有没有併發症？</p>
<p>（答）有的，像乾性肋膜炎，膿胸，肺壞疽，肝膿瘍等都是。也有併發心包炎或腦膜炎的。</p>
<p>（問）格魯布性肺炎的豫後怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）大概在年幼的人，没有什麽危險。老年人，心臟病，肺氣腫，脊柱後彎症，糖尿病，肌胖病，賢藏病，姙娠，酒客等病人，都不良。</p>
<p>（問）本病應當怎樣療治呢？</p>
<p>（答）病人宜絶對臥床安靜，胸部貼温濕布，心臟部和頭部置冰囊，給與流動性食物，内服吐根浸，洋遠志浸錏茴香水等祛痰藥，注射樟腦，洋地黄素，咖啡因等强心劑。退熱藥有時可用奎寗劑的注射，或内服Ｏptohino在小兒可注射肺炎血清。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c239">再談白濁菌 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 朱仰高</p>
<p>自從一千八百七十九年乃氏（Ｎrisser）發明了這白濁雙球菌之後。後來卽由布氏（Ｂumm）確實的認作白濁症的病原物。因爲他把這球菌用人工的方法純粹的培養出來，（純粹培養卽是由一堆雜菌中裏，培養出一種所要的細菌，）並且能用這培養出來的白濁菌，在健全人底尿管裏做了一個人工的（有意的）眞性白濁症，於是以前的病原物的疑團，至此就冰釋無遺了。</p>
<p>白濁菌的本身，至今可以說研究得清清爽爽，吾們並且可以把白濁菌分爲若干的異型，（此種分析方法，好比吾們在同一人族中區别個人的性格無異，此種精密的手續，在大如人體者固不足奇，然在如此的微生物上，然亦可以同樣做到，那就可以探知今日微生學之進步矣，）白濁菌的長是等於一·六米，（一米等於千份之一的密厘密達，）闊呢尙不足一米，（○·六米）亦可想到牠的實在的大小了。（人的血液，用肉眼看來，是一種流體，但是吾們知道牠並不）</p>
<p>是如水一般的東西，蓋其中含有極大量的有形體的紅白血球等等，白血球是大的，紅血球是小的，這紅血球是有七個米大，如果吾們把白濁菌與牠來比一比，尙是這有牠的幾十份之幾的容量。）人的白血球是大於紅血球二三倍，（約長十五米，）其中竟可包含白濁的球菌到百餘個之多。（平常當然没有怎樣多，）白濁菌是一種無動性的，怕熱的，（四十度之外卽受傷害，）怕旱的，並且容易消毒的病原菌，因爲牠的生活力（在人體外）極小，（普通只有一小時，）所以在培養此病菌的時候，最好取出病液之後，立即種上適宜的（温暖的）培養基上，那麽比較的可以得着好些的結果。</p>
<p>講到檢查白濁菌，在急性白濁，（尿管或眼膜炎等）固然是並不困難，但是在慢性的白濁症，確是件較難的問題了。除了臨床的症象診斷，及煽動刺激法（Ｐrovokation）等等之外，尙須行其他的細菌學方面的檢定，如血清反應，膿液的顯微鏡檢查及培養等等的試騐。此類方法，用之得時，則在今日之情形下，已可把一大部份的病家得着滿意的診斷。（吾所以把這末句話說出來，因爲眼見許多的病家，得着此病之後，感覺極大的精神上的痛苦，天天在疑疑惑惑之中，不知道本身的白濁症好了没有，所以談者趁此機會，更希望未病者之留意預防，並聲明花柳病之爲害之大。）</p>
<p>白濁病症之多少，是與文明進步成正比例。故處世在這二十世紀的人們，患此症的數目可稱很多。據德醫愛而迫氏（Ｅrb）的統計，所有他的病家，（二千人男性）共計百份之五十是得過此病。又據非孝氏（ＷＦisther）的統計，則稱凡住在大城市的人（至五十歲）們，平均都染着過一次半的白濁。不論以上的統計是對的或不對的，總之在歐西方面，生這病的人，確是不少吾國漸漸歐化，上海又是世界大都市之一，生白濁的人，雖難於統計，但爲數當不在小，這是無疑的。</p>
<p>因此吾們對於此病及其他花柳病的公共衞生方面，不得不稍加注意。其辦法可分爲二部：第一方面，卽政府方面，可用特種法規專理一般帶有危及民族性的花柳病；（德國有先例）第二方面，可用通俗宣傳（民衆自動的）的辦法，來使一般了解此花柳病之危險，並其預防的方法。</p>
<p>白濁症的二大危險：</p>
<p>（一）生白濁的母親，常使其嬰兒染着此症而成割眼。</p>
<p>（二）白濁症可减少國民生産率，（照非考氏的統計，凡不生育的母親，約有百份之四十至五十，是因爲她患有白濁病之故。（其他對於病體的危險，暫不計及，）</p>
<p>藥品預防：</p>
<p>因爲白濁菌是極怕銀製劑，所以克氏（Ｃrede）用牠滴在新生的孩兒眼裏來預防眼睛白濁，其後就有人將此法用於生殖器部份，亦得有相當的成績。（其他化學品暫不計及，）</p>
<p>吾們呢，尙有舊道德的關係，有許多人不願將此病好好的去醫治，免得人家知道了，尤其是婦女方面更甚。此種思想，照鄙人的意思，似乎可不必如此拘束，尤其是因爲醫家對於病家，原來是有守秘密的義務。</p>
<h3 id="c240">熱病淺說（上） <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 沈康白</p>
<p>健康人體温。常在體温表三十七度相近。過此卽爲有熱。卽俗稱寒熱是也。考熱之發生。乃因各種病原。侵入人體。致體内發温與放盪調節機關。不能保持平衡狀態。致熱度加增。兼有呼吸消化血行神經排洩各器官之障害。是吾人所常見者也。</p>
<p>凡由化學的毒物。或細菌的毒素。侵入血中。由其中毒中用而生熱。謂之中毒熱。然有時血中無起熱物之侵入。而發熱者。是謂非中毒熱。如神經障碍之神經熱。赫思底利Ｈysterie之奇怪熱型是也。</p>
<p>夫體温增進之原理。乃由發温增加。放温减少所致。放温之所以减少。乃由小動脈之收縮。致肺與皮膚表面之放温减少。同時新陳代謝機能則異常亢進　然過剩之熱。仍不能因之而有所减退也。</p>
<p>凡熱病之經過。大别可分爲下列四期。</p>
<p>（一）增進期　夫熱病有長短久暫之别。當體内血温旣昇之際。血管週圍之神經。受其刺激。致皮膚之毛細血管收縮。同時脈搏細硬而急速。呼吸淺清而頻數。且有頭痛寒顫等不快之感。且發温增加。放温減少。約一二小時。體温遂急亟昇高而達第二期。苟熱長者。初起常無惡寒。熱亦由漸而昇。約經一至數日而達第二期。</p>
<p>（二）極進期　此期爲熱病最嚴重之期。血管神經之亢奮依然不止。發温之增加因而持續。呼吸速。脈搏頻。患者有煩渴不安。倦怠失眠。食慾不振。分泌減少等症。且因肌温及放温之不正。或則皮膚蒼白冷厥。或則潮紅灼熱。倘熱型過高。則有害心肌。心力因而衰弱。若熱不越三十九度者。或尙無妨碍。此期之長短不一。有數時卽退如瘧疾是也。有亘數週者。如傷寒是也。</p>
<p>（三）减退期　患者一至此期。則皮膚血管逐漸擴張而充血。發汗甚多放温增加。而熱遂退。然其經過之長短。各有不同。短者自二三小時至三十六小時。其熱方解。名曰分利性減退。長者自二三日乃至三四日之問。於每朝逐漸減退一二度。以至平温。是曰渙散性減退。熱解後。脈搏雖尙軟弱。而患者則覺全身爽快。如釋重負。因疲勞煩渴而　安眠。</p>
<p>（四）恢復期　患者一至此期。體温往往興健康時無異者爲多。然亦有降至常温以下。二三日始復平常之體温者有之。又有於此期。每晚發輕熱者。</p>
<p>夫熱病之體温。通常皆朝降而夕昇。然亦有朝昇而夕降。或一日昇降數次者。茲就極進期中於朝夕昇降時。區别爲下列之三型。</p>
<p>（一）稽留熱ＦebrisContinea朝夕熱度之昇降。相差甚微。大抵熱狀常保持在同一水平線上。往往纒綿五六日。或一二週。而其熱方解。於急性傳染病。及急性炎症見之。</p>
<p>（二）弛張熱ＦibrisRemitens朝夕昇降之差甚大。而越常軌者也。常於輕性炎症。及慢性病等見之。</p>
<p>（三）間歇熱ＦebrisIntermittens常温與高温。於每日隔日。或每隔三日或一週左右。整然相互交換者也。例如瘧疾再歸熱等是。</p>
<p>其他更有暫時熱。與厞定型熱。前者之持續甚短。後者乃發不正之熱。而每日昇降無定者也。（未完）</p>

<p>— 王完白</p>
<p>吾國社會對醫學觀念之複雜與矛盾。於今爲極。一遇較難療治之病。莫不中西亂投。無所適從。或礙於親友之推薦。或惑於廣告之虚誇。姑爲嘗試。無識别與决擇之充分知識。此其一。</p>
<p>卽已延醫診治。亦鮮有長久信赖之者。往往僅憑一藥之是否立卽見效以爲斷否則日易數醫。不以爲怪。而應邀者亦無赤心負責之機會。此其二。</p>
<p>病家對舊醫之方藥。大都耳熟能詳。常喜參加意見。以顯其能。對新醫之名詞與理論。則因缺乏科學之基本知識。多瞠目結舌。莫名其妙。故信任之念無由發生。此其三。觀此數點。欲求病家能多受科學治療之益。非對社會多量輸灌新醫之常識不可。</p>
<p>輸灌醫學知識。向日所採用之方式。最普通者有二。一爲文學宣傳。二爲集會演講。如報章雜誌之醫藥論著。及會塲學校之衞生演說。但效力祗能及於能讀書報之中上流人物。或偶一聽講之少數座客。然家庭中對醫藥問題主權最大之婦女界。甚難得有效之方法。加以開導。</p>
<p>近所流行之電台播音。因能深入各地之家庭。男婦老幼。無不喜聽。勢力之大。無與倫比。據調查所知。輸入上海一埠之收简音機。業已售出者在二十萬具以上。若能用正當方法。從事宣傳。實爲輸灌醫學新知識之無上利器。</p>
<p>余去年春間。因戰事來滬。適遇中西電台落成。主人本屬老友。約余至電台講醫學常識。余以此舉合余服務社會之素志。乃允盡義務。但絶對不爲任何個人或機關作宣傳。後每日在午間講有系統之醫學新知識。不意遠近聽衆。來函表示歡迎者。日有多起。或有以醫藥問題相討論者。余於解答時。從不介紹專科藥品。或醫院醫師。故聽者皆知所講毫無作用或背景。有多處聽衆。按時約集親友圍坐收聽。且逐日紀錄講詞。以资研究。社會對醫學知識需求若渴之狀况。於此可以想見。</p>
<p>今年冬。基督敎同人。因鑒於商業電台。娱樂節目與商店廣告太覺龐雜。故發起另創一完全慈善性質之福音廣播電台。推余主持一切。余特在每晚八時最便利之時間。定一醫學衞生節目。訂請上海市衞生局。及醫師公會同人。按期主講。各地聽衆更起熱烈之歡迎。今其他電台亦接踵而起。增加醫學節目。實爲良好現象。</p>
<p>由過去軍經騐。無線電之播音。後必日益發達。各省市之新建電台者。亦相繼而起。我新醫界同仁。應善用此千載一時之良機。與各地電台合作。犧牲賓貴之時間。担任義務宣講。以期新醫之科學理解。亦能普及民間。家喻户曉。倘能集合同志。自建電台。。專講醫學衞生。則收效尤宏。諸君其有在意乎。</p>

<p>— 孟眞</p>
<p>自從兩年前有一次偶然地看過胡蝶主演的「啼笑姻緣」，直到現在，還悔之不迭，我就無論如何不願看國産影片。但是因了友朋的宣傳，最近我又看了胡蝶主演的「姊妹花」。在這片中，對於胡蝶，我不能不說她是有了成功。</p>
<p>這個片子的事實如軍閥的横征暴斂，奢侈淫逸，人民之困苦顚連，流離失所，雖說是民國十三年的事，其實也是亘古常新的狀况。胡蝶及扮老母的那個女角，能够把貧民的苦况都如實地表現了出來，使人看了，發生共同的感情，這正是藝術的成功。</p>
<p>不過由這個片子所提出的問題，却並不以其藝術的成功而得到解答。就純粹藝術言，只要表現事實便足，似乎不必提出什麽解决的方案，如上海在的宣傳所用。這可說是寫實主義的手法。他的力量在暴露事實，提醒世人，給與觀衆以深刻的暗示。但這是十九世紀的，像易卜生的戲劇給人稱爲「問題劇」一樣，姊妹花不過提出一個問題。丨丨一般人民除了把女兒送給軍閥爲姨太太或爲軍閥服役以外，還有什麽生活的路嗎？</p>
<p>看了影片，在從新光歸家的途中，我這樣的思量着。胡蝶的哭聲似還在耳中盪漾，那一種抛兒離家的苦痛狀况，也似在眼中閑耀。我且思且走的穿過馬路。抬頭一看，迎面便是那代售航空奬劵的店舖。於是就前一個思想浮上我的腦袋，難道這不是生活的路嗎？姊妹花所提出的問題，也許這就是解答之所在罷。可惜這奬劵要好幾個月來一回，倘若每天都有一個頭彩的希望，那是多麽好啊。</p>
<h3 id="c243">南國的小嶼 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 岳萌</p>
<p>白天，登上小坡，四周綠盈盈的海水，便爽然在望。入夜，睡在廊下，檳榔嶼的萬家燈火，就會從遠處的海上，撲面迎來。丨丨這是印度洋中的一個小嶼，鄰近着馬來半島的。</p>
<p>一九三○年的四月中旬，因事由缅甸赴星加坡，船經檳榔嶼，擬改道登陸，搭乘馬來聯邦的火車，不料竟給當地的衞生局，將我和一批印度人，扣留在這個小嶼上，消了一禮拜的毒。原因是，我們動身的地方，如孟買，曼德拉斯，加爾各達，及仰光等處，通已宣布爲暑天的疫港了。（在印度和缅甸，陽曆三月尾，各學校便開始放暑假了。）不過這只限於我們這些乘坐三等艙的，因爲當我們被邀上小船划向小嶼去的時候，頭二等的旅客們，却仍是歡然地自由地登上岸去。</p>
<p>然而，在這一禮拜中，眞算是享着從來所未有的清福吧？每天紅日的光輝，一拂去海上的朝霧時，便有人跑來把我們呌起，整隊立在樹蔭覆着的沙地上，裸露出上身，由白人醫生統率三四馬來助手，一一加以查騐，彷彿軍官檢閱新兵一樣，慈祥之氣，是一點也没有的。不過素來爲社會所不重視的人們，也居然能得着如此的照顧，總算是要令人不勝感激的了。雖然，那其間還深藏着另外的因素。約到早上九點鐘的光景，照例發給每人一份糧食，像乾魚，洋山芋，牛奶，雞蛋之類，總不缺少的。而印度人呢，也許就因爲是印度人的原故吧，且特别可以得着牛肉或子雞。</p>
<p>我們是住在軍營式（Ｃarnp）的屋裏，墻壁自腰以上，全是空的，眞是海上的清風，山間的明月，都可以自由地來拜訪我們。晝長無事，便爬在墻壁上坐着、閒眺波上搖曳的片片風帆，嘴裏却悠悠地吹着口哨。晚上睡在光滑的水門汀上面，靜聽着南印度人的歌聲，便怡然飄入夢中。屋外的空地，一半是水泥敷設的，可以早晚散步，可以晾晒衣裳。另一半却面以泥沙，上遮綠蔭，我們一天兩次，就在樹下，生起野火，烹調食物。</p>
<p>在許多印度人中，除我是個異國漂泊者之外、還有一家不丹國人，他們小家庭間的憂鬱氣氛，常常引起我的注意。男子是短小而茁壯的，腰上掛着一把　長的彎刀。頭剃得光光，只在後頂留一撮毛，看起來倒彷彿小孩似的，這原是宗敎的標記，印度的一般興度敎徒，都少不了這點花樣的，想來不丹人的文化，是大量地受着印度的影響吧？他好像時常都在發氣，兩個破衣汚穢的孩子，終日呆呆地坐在媽媽身邊，似乎是嚇得動也不敢動地。母親則骨都着嘴，靜靜地補着破衣，我一望見他們，便覺得宛如到了喜馬拉雅山上·對着陰愁的天色和長年不化的雪一樣，明媚的光輝的南國，於他們也彷彿全無補益呵！我想問一句，你們爲什麽遠離去你們的故鄉呢，但却不知道要用那國語言才好，因爲不丹話我是不懂得的。但一禮拜的接觸，他們眉宇間的氣色，也就全部告訴了我。難道一個流浪人還看不出别個流浪的因子麽？</p>

<p>有人憤慨，中國十餘年來的社會變革，反映在文學作品上的，祗是一張白紙。此語固不免爲過分之談，然創作不能有力的反映社會，如此可見。所以，偉大作品的産生，實在不是一件容易事。安致遠與蔡漫夫書云：「人常謂天寳二十年離亂，祇成得杜老一部詩集。自丙子以來十餘年中，將偌大一個乾坤，反覆播弄，幾番整頓，始有今日，不知尙有少陵野老，睥睨其旁否？有其時無其才，亦是天地一大缺陷」。是眞不啻爲今日文壇寫照也。我期待着偉大的作品之産生。</p>

<p>（七）</p>
<p>「愁」「病」是讀書人資本，此說大奇，然亦歷來之最普遍最平常的解說。曾弗人與邱小魯書，謂「來書謂在愁病中，此二字是我輩讀書著書資本，若在快樂猛健中，正不知增多少風流興會，未必與靜功無損也」。是不啻爲此說加一註脚。</p>

<h3 id="c245">雜談幽默 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>一九三三年對於中國的國民是「國貨年」，但在「海派」文士們，却又是「幽默年。」這一年中最盛行的文章，是幽默文章。比起「輸入日貨二萬萬元」的「國貨年」來，「幽默年」的成績似乎好得多，自論語以下，大大小小的許多刋物，都被幽默之風所偃。而且流風餘韻，至今未沫，大概在一九三四年這「婦女國貨年」中，論語的銷數仍然不會减少的罷？</p>
<p>什麽是「幽默」？大家都已知道是一個外國字Ｈumor的譯名。Ｈumor是怎樣一種東西呢，去年論語上曾經有許多專家討論過，但終於不能給我們一個要領，直至近日，始有林語堂先生的論幽默上，中，下三篇，可以說是關於幽默的最詳盡的理論。詳盡是詳盡了，但是，仍然，他也還不能給我們一個具體而明白簡單的定義。大概誠如德哥勃拉所說，「何謂幽默」這問題，是「比宇宙引力的問題更麻烦的問題！是文藝批評上的不規則多邊形！永遠没有人能够分析一個幽默作家的心理，這種心理使人捉摸不定，好比被生物學家所追趕的蝴蝶，當你剛以爲捉住了牠的時候，牠却逃了。」</p>
<p>說起德哥勃拉（ＭauciceDecobra），大家還記得，是法國的一個作家，去年來過上海的，上海人把他當作一個幽默家而歡迎過，和歡迎蕭伯訥一般，當然没有迎蕭那麽地盛大。照例，我們的新聞記者對於他舉行了一番口試，他也回答了一番幽默的談話，但據論語鑒定，他的答語算不上幽默。而且他所說的看得中國女子很美，竟被魅惑的話，惹起北平一位「姑娘」的抗議，很没趣。由此也可以知道他並不是一個高明的幽默家了。</p>
<p>但他對於幽默是用心在研究的。最近我看到他的一本書，呌做霧裏的笑，是他所編的英美幽默作家選集，在前面有他的一篇序文，題目呌做盎格羅撒克遜的幽默。</p>
<p>這序文開端，便是在上面引過的幾句話，接着，他又說「許多人常常試着給幽默下定義。有的提出考據式的定義　有的提出哲學似的曖昧的深刻的定義，有的提出歐幾里得的定理似的嚴格的定義···還有種種其他的。這些全都有點道理，但也没有一個是完全的。」</p>
<p>因此，他從新費了一番功夫，向英美的許多幽默作家徵求幽默的定義。</p>
<p>對於他的這種工作，應徵的人很多，現在抄繹幾條在下面：</p>
<p>「幽默的定義是不能下的，這是使人發笑的一種主要的原素」。丨蕭伯訥。　　「我不相信幽默這東西是可以解釋的。但照我的意思，幽默是這樣一種東西，···以其滑稽使我們感動的東西」ＪeromeKJerome</p>
<p>「我常以爲幽默是我們所吸取的空氣中的養氣那一類東西。牠創造而且保持人類的歡笑。牠固然還能創造别的許多更重要的東西，但以歡笑爲最先。」ＲCCarton</p>
<p>「幽默是智者的眼中的微笑」IsraelZangwill</p>
<p>「噯喲！我是常常在嘗試給幽默下定義的，但我也常常失敗！在我們之間最流行的態度是：與其跟着一個故事中的主人公一同笑，不如嘲笑他之爲愈」。ＷＰettredge</p>
<p>「我們也許可以這樣說，這是一個不通世故的人的愉快的思想」ＦＡnstej</p>
<p>人們常常從人種或國家的分别上來區别機智和幽默。他們說機智是拉丁人種的特質，而幽默是屬於北方人種的，如盎格羅撒克遜人或斯干的那維亞人。我覺得這種區分是武斷的，因爲有很多的例子證明着，北人也有機智，同時南歐人也有幽默。我以爲兩者的分别，實由不同的性情所産生，由我說來，幽默是對於變幻無定的人生的微妙的觀察，是摧毁憂鬱的思想的諷刺的力量，這種諷刺，時而取嚴重的態度，時而取游戲的態度，總之是要使我們暫時感到那些擾亂心胸的事情的無意義。」丨Ｗ·Ｌ·Ｃoustney（未完）</p>

<p>今天車站上可熱閙：車裏頭擠着各式各樣的人，站台上也是擠着各式各樣的人。黑壓壓的裏面還放着六塊舖板釘成的棺材，没有人躺的帆布床，一綑一綑的大槍，一紥一紥的山西人做的手溜彈···在對面的列車上，插着紅十字旗子，紅卍字旗子，裏頭横七竪八地臥滿了受着重傷不能動彈的兵士·····</p>
<p>越是靠近機關車的地方越是亂哄哄的；其實機關車頭還没有來，來了恐怕也要被這亂哄哄的聲音壓了下去聽不見。可是越往後走就越清靜，這清靜的度數是可以跟着車輛數的：二等丨二等丨頭等丨頭等餐車丨頭等臥車····萬國特等臥車·····</p>
<p>這一次萬國的特等臥車裏却裝了一個「國際英雄」的骨灰盒子。一邊放着兩個花圈，把這輛本來就富麗堂皇的車子襯得更有生氣更好看了。</p>
<p>剛才從保衞界裏出來的那些東洋兵，全都在這里集合起來了。他們順着列車排了兩行，像兩張「天牌」接在一起似的。</p>
<p>一個有兩撇極濃的仁丹式鬍子的軍官，看着很怱忙而且嚴肅，一會兒走上車，一會走下來，離開車時間不遠的當兒，他又以最規則的步法跑向水關那邊去了。因爲他的跑步足聲，使我們這個亂哄哄的車站裏鎭靜了許多，并且自然而然地給他開了一條道。從這刹那的鎭靜中，才可以看見了我們的路警，站長丨戴三道八道金箍　的丨都悄悄地像鬼似的躱在人羣的當中。有一個穿禮服呢千層底鞋的軍官，居然在他正點紙烟的時候也轉一下頭。他心裏在想麽？在前線上，我們終歸有見面的日子！</p>
<p>預告開車的鈴鐺響了，那個帶仁丹鬍子軍官才急怱怱地跑回來回來。他手裏托着一個三脚銅香爐和幾根線香，步法跑得還是和去時那麽一樣整齊。只是他的鬍子太重了，跑起來一上一下地扇着，彷彿眞的倒像了假的，未免失掉一些尊嚴而帶着滑稽的味道了。</p>
<p>「窩嘍窩嘍！」</p>
<p>不懂得他是喊的什麽，那兩排短腿兵就隨着這口令立正了。</p>
<p>車開始蠕動了。</p>
<p>不久，又是一聲：</p>
<p>「窩嘍窩嘍！窩裏嘍！」</p>
<p>這次的聲音似乎又複雜了一些，可是更不知道是什麽意思了。只見那兩排短腿兵由兩張「天牌」式的行列而變成四張「長三」式的行列了。他們遙遙地向着那漸去漸遠的列車行着敬禮。就在我們的列車上爲他們載着「馬革裏屍的戰士」丨我們的列車上載着屠殺我們自己父老兄弟的劊子手。</p>
<p>車站頓時冷清了許多没有走的只是那些走不了的傷兵，他們連呻吟都不呻吟地躺在那裏。還有的就是被遺留下來的那薄板的棺材，裏面裝着我們的無聲無　的戰士的屍骨。</p>
<p>車站外面倒眞是熱閙死了，幾萬件行李差不多要堆到街心，誰知道它們是向那裏運呢？</p>

<p>在這年頭，除了極少數有特殊的地位的作家·每月所入足以應付衣食住之外；其他的一切握筆桿者·差不多都在過着支離破碎的生活，終日咬着牙根與窮鬼周旋，間亦有聰明能幹的改途易業，或奔趨宦海，不過那是少之又少。而别無旁路可走的就祗有埋頭硬幹，以至於貧死餓死爲止，</p>

<p>返鄉瑣記</p>
<p>不是母親的兒子·生了個祖母的孫子。</p>
<p>在一個忘了的日子，跑到上海來之後，由於兩個人的賣命，病貧之中撕破了五組日歷。去年，妻的懷孕，敲破了一隻二十八塊錢一月的小學敎員的職位，更在禍不單行的俗俚下我患了很久時候的病，於是在小孩子將要問世的時候，姑敲木鐘的寫信到家裏要幾個錢，回信是在預料中的失望，然而孩子却自然地降臨到這個罪惡的世界上來了。一封簡單的信。某月某日某時産一男孩，大小平安，作爲掛號。但在不預料中來了封回信，講了許多孩子的什麽什麽，大概可作育兒須知讀，最後說彌月之後回鄉來瞧瞧她不是兒子的兒子。照例，自然應該抱回去，我或者爲了這小孩子面上添些金光。雖然不見得他將來是個眞命天子，但在故鄉，頭胎生男孩，倒底認爲可喜的事；不過在我，荒曠了可以賺錢的時候，再籌備了路費之類的額外支出，求一個僅僅「瞧」的結束，也倒底認爲損失的事。就推說「龍體違和」，再以瞎子的話「不出行」等把戲搪塞了事。</p>
<p>廢歷年底，不預料的信又來了，「新春拜年，無論如何帶孩子回來！」這是一條命令，有「違者格殺勿論」的嚴重，於是小得已抱着孩子「下江南」了。</p>
<p>從火車站踏上故鄉的土地，好像我對於每個人都是那般熟悉；然而都是陌生。黄包車在馬路上拉過，瞧見了許多「小脚放大脚」式的摩登洋房，故鄉似乎不再是我的了。「啊！五年了！」輕輕地嘘着，走着像夢中的路一樣抵家門口。</p>
<p>五株老樹矗在門前，牠們認識我的，一陣風過，牠們同聲地喊着「家啊！」是的，「家啊！」我台頭望着這破壞不堪的老屋，半邊支着兩根挺粗的木撑，牠的命運或者已在目前了。「家啊！五年來闊别的家啊！」</p>
<p>車子停住在門口，一個老年的婦人，瞧黄毛子似的　着我們。我認識她的，她是祖母手下的老僕人，那般忠心，和舊小說中的老僕人一樣。可是她祇能守着破屋，不能做一番救小主人的故事。我呌了她的名子，她纔瞇着眼跑出門口來　眞的，少爺奶奶回來了，哈哈哈，小阿官：一也忘了自己的年紀從妻手中把孩子搶了過去。抱到手裏，攙「哈多重啊！吳媽不中用了！」的說起來，下一句輕得像說給自己聽的。然而丨她嘆了口氣，喜孜孜的跑進去報信了。</p>
<p>母親立在堂屋裏，她微笑的抱着孫兒。吳媽彷彿從前家中來了多少客人似的忙這忙那，她雖不能救小主人，忠於小主人倒底是實在的。可憐的老婦人啊！</p>
<p>來信上「帶孩回來」之前，是「新春拜年，」這也是件大事。我似乎已忘了兒子對於母親還有信一套手續，妻提醒了，才不致辱命。</p>
<p>小孩子哭了，妻從母親手中授過來。婆媳兩個並在一起，我發覺妻出奇的蒼老。據說生了孩子的女人是容易老去的，母親生過兩個兒子，雖然現在的兒子不是她的。在年齡上，生育上，和妻對比起來，母親不應那樣年輕，妻的蒼老似乎是神話了。一個二十二歲的青春少婦啊！</p>
<p>眼皮羞澀的我跑到廳屋裏去，瞧瞧父親的像，他也年青。我的手自然的伸到　下，剌辣辣的鬚根己告訴我超出父親的年齡了，這時候我失了知覺，不知停留了多久，被母親呌醒。她問我在廳屋裏幹什麽？我隨口的答了句「瞧瞧我種的花。」</p>
<p>「早死完了·」她聲音聽來提得特别高。</p>
<p>「傻子！」我駡自巳。五年了啊，幾株小小的花草，經自然的摧殘，不受人類的保護，牠能不死去嗎？像人一樣，一個二十四歲的青年啊！</p>
<p>歇司底裏地獨自就向外跑。</p>
<p>歸來，在煤油燈下晚膳。我和妻對坐着，母親抱了孫兒立在横頭，忽然小孩子哭起來，講孩子什麽什麽的母親，就用育兒須知的什麽什麽來哄騙他。可是眞命天子不同凡響，他划着小拳頭儘是哭。</p>
<p>「認娘？」有經騐的母親不信任自己的方法會一敗塗地。</p>
<p>妻　放了飯碗把孩子接過來，划着小拳頭笑了。</p>
<p>「認娘？」我說。</p>
<p>妻笑了。那樣滿意，從結婚來我没有瞧見過。</p>
<p>横頭没有聲息，我低首頭吃飯，望着一顆顆的米推至嘴里去。</p>

<p>— 覺</p>
<p>翻開報紙，自殺的新聞，每天接觸於眼簾。我每次見到了這一類的新聞，總覺得這是不應該的行爲：同時，有一般人，又極力讚頌自殺者的勇氣，譏誚我這種態度，是怕死。我自己固不敢承認我有自殺的勇氣，可是，說我怕死，我又絶對不能承認。一般人的見解，總以爲自殺與怕死，是兩個相對的名詞，自殺者不怕死，怕死者不會自殺，絶没有像我這樣思想矛盾的。其實，死與活，都是有他的眞義存在着的，因借本欄篇幅之一角，提出討論，以期在這裏探求出怎樣才是我們應有的態度。</p>
<p>我們要知道：我們與死是不碰頭的，死神降臨的時候，人已經不存在，人存在的時候，就没有死，在我們的字典上是找不出「死」字的，因爲我們死了，我們這部字典，也就跟隨着毁滅了。所以怕死這句話，歸根結蒂的講起來，實是帶幾分滑稽的意味！我聽過一個故事：一位預言家與人打賭，預言家一定說這世界不出十年，就要完全毁滅，那人不相信，說絶對不會這樣，兩人相持不下，結果，就以一千塊錢打賭：後來，有人問他，你那來這末多錢，跟人輸東道，萬一輸了，你怎樣辦？那人笑着說：倘這個世界，眞眞毁滅了，没有他，也没有我，這東道從何輸起！這雖然是一個笑話，但細玩其味，很可使我們明瞭人與花的關係，到底是怎樣？所以死這一名詞，他的意義，僅是我們人類離開這世界的一瞬間：他與人生的關係，是突變的，死一來，人的知覺馬上就斷絶，我們本身絶不能體騐到死是怎樣一回事。那末，人旣不能體騐到死，便有何可怕！同時，人生的過程上，也許是多礁石的，使我們常常感到進行上的困難；我們因爲不願與困難搏戰，於是相率於自毁，以期逃出這社會，眼不見爲凈。但這不過是一時間感情上的畸形衝動，從實際上講，我們自從呱呱的降下地來，經父母的愛護，社會的培植，撫養成人；旣成了一個人，我們就祗有不得已的做一個人，絶不應該　到了些　　離，些　　　　　　　甲而準　倘　圖逃出這社會的，就是抛棄他們的責任，就是罪惡。至於說環境的困難，無法解除，那更不敢贊同，原因所在，並不是困難的不能解除，實是他自已不肯繼續不斷的與困難奮鬭。自殺，根本是一種弱者的行爲，除了死的崇拜者外，絶不能引起人們的同情，他的錯誤，也用不着化上許多篇幅來討論，事情是很明顯的擺在我們面前的。</p>
<p>總之，怕死固不可以，自殺史不應該，我們祗有把握着現實，因爲過去的是算了。未來的我們絶對不知道，祗有現實，我們才能把握着。挺着胸脯朝前幹，這才是好男兒應有的身手。</p>

<p>報載：「北平電，古物保管委員會發見盜砍丁柏，除天壇先農壇外，尙有日壇地壇共百零三株，半非蟲枯。又國子監亦有多株標頭待踞，且譚計全木廠所稱售價不同，該會已電内部澈究，輿論對此愈注意，某報評論謂内政部應負全責，因盜砍者乃内部所派，樹有蟲可撲滅，無連株毁去之理云。一我們看了這一段新聞，覺得眞是新聞。</p>
<p>自從「九一八」以後，北平古物南遷，其意義是古物乃珍奇之寳，不能够跟着北平的萬一失落一起失落，因此南遷保存於上海租界。算是萬幸得很，（雖知從北平南遷路途遙遠舟車跋踄在路上（？）遺失了一些，但是大部分是安全不缺的）現在北平日在强鄰耽耽虎視之下，後事如何，誰也不敢預料，那未除了古物丨古董之類丨北平還有古柏也算是値錢之物，如果不將丁柏南遷说該有個妥當辦法才對。内部派員砍去古柏，雖然用意何在未見宣布，顯然的是爲國家文化的保存起見而砍下古柏南遷，北平的輿論眞是坐井觀天毫無遠識，難道連這一點理由都想不到？又某報亦更奇怪，明明記載着是内部派員去砍的，却標題着「盜砍」，而且文中又說「因盜砍者乃内部所派」等語，這簡直是無法無天的了！夫「盜砍者」乃屬罪犯，怎麽可以直　曰「乃内部所派？」如要說是内部所派，至少也應該　說砍者不能加上　者　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　中國人最會大驚小怪，尤其是最會見小事而大嚷，一件盜砍古柏的事，比諸國家領土的失去，相差何啻千里，盜砍古柏算做什麽大不了事，何况盜砍者還是政府所派？更何况盜砍古柏的意義，顯然是與古物同樣是在南遷以保永存？</p>

<p>原來開彩要漲價的，這兩件事相連起來倒是個「問題」。</p>
<p>我後悔不接受朋友的勸告，在每一期航空奬劵開彩的那天就要多損失銅元二枚：如其恢復到彩票盛行時期，我無論懶到如何程度，一定坐黄包車到報館去訂一份，大概車錢總能出産的。</p>

<p>(Beiping) After the reception of Gubeikou, the office of the pseudo-Luanping County was closed and abolished. The pseudo-border police team stationed in the southern Tianmen Beixiapo and the pseudo-Rehe Province Customs Collection Office in the city were withdrawn to the north of the North Gate and the area near the Great Wall. After the administrative reception of the ancient town, our side immediately posted notices in the town and nearby villages to inform merchants and residents to live and work in peace. Various entertainment associations organized by the local people began to be held in the afternoon, and the evening was even more lively. (4th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) About a thousand soldiers of the Japanese garrison in North China set off on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway on March 1 for a military exercise. On the morning of the 4th, infantry and cavalry units returned to the Japanese barracks via Xiyingmen and Xiguan in the Chinese Concession. In the afternoon, a military parade was held on Miyajima Street in the Japanese Concession. Japanese veterans and volunteer corps also participated. (4th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the Japanese army conducted a large-scale exercise along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, they returned to Tianjin today, passing through the western city and entering the Japanese Concession. The Chinese people were already very irritated by the Japanese Concession's celebration of Puyi's ascension to the throne. Seeing the large-scale Japanese military exercises now, they felt even more indignant. The Chinese newspapers pointed out that this move by the Japanese army was surprising and indefensible, and contradicted Japan's status as a great power and the principle of royalism. However, the Japanese side said that Commander Nakamura would soon return to his country, so the exercise was held to honor him and had nothing to do with Puyi's ascension to the throne.

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan recently passed four important resolutions on the pseudo-Manchukuo usurpation, including one requesting the National Government to issue a declaration of non-recognition of pseudo-organizations and announce it to all countries, and another to formulate measures to punish traitorous activities. Regarding the issuance of a declaration, the government believes that the non-recognition of pseudo-organizations by various countries has become an ironclad international case, and there is no need to issue another declaration. The case of preventing traitorous activities was discussed at a high-level central meeting the following day, which stipulated the methods of punishment and disposal and ordered their implementation.

<p>(Beiping) Shi Zhongren and Yu Youjun from Liaoning have recently been issuing commissions to a large number of division, brigade, and regimental commanders in Beiping in the name of the pseudo-North China National Salvation Army. Many disgruntled people have joined them. The Central Military Police Corps learned that Shi and Yu were in internal strife, and Yu secretly reported to the corps. On the evening of the 3rd, the corps sent personnel to arrest Shi and Yu. After interrogation, it was determined that they were accomplices and were sent to the Baoding Garrison Headquarters for strict handling. (4th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) Guo Taiqi, the Chinese ambassador to Britain, acting on instructions from Nanjing, protested to the Foreign Office today against the Burmese company leading an armed escort across the border into Yunnan Province.

<p>(Nanjing) It was once reported that the war in Guizhou Province had been peacefully resolved, and the troops of Che Mingyi and Lei Mingjiu had been reorganized by Wang Jialie and sent to the Shiqian-Sinan area. However, Chen Quzhen, the commander of the New 34th Division in western Hunan, telegraphed Nanjing, saying that Wang Jialie of Guizhou had suffered heavy losses after being defeated by my Li and Zhou brigades at Tianjiaping Miaomiaoyan. Wang's subordinate, Bai Huizhang (commander of the Guizhou Army), was almost captured alive. Taking advantage of the victory, we could have taken Zhenyuan directly, but due to the mediation of various parties, Wang of Guizhou sent Bai Huizhang again to seek peace with me. Chen adhered to the principle of not being excessive and temporarily did not advance. Currently, the troops of Che Mingyi, Lei Mingjiu, and Yang Qichang are still concentrated on the border between Hunan and Guizhou, actively reorganizing and preparing. Outsiders do not understand the truth, and rumors are rampant, which seems to be a propaganda on the part of Wang of Guizhou and is absolutely unbelievable. I hope that it will be corrected nearby.

<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin and Pang, Hu, and Ji received a telegram from Fu Zhankui on the 4th, stating that after arriving in Linhe, he would advance to Dengkou. Li Mingxian arrived in Dengkou and contacted Sun's generals, and Sun's generals telegraphed the front to report to Sun. A reply from Sun was received, agreeing to go to Dengkou. Sun is currently near Ningyuan and is expected to arrive in Dengkou in two or three days. I can also arrive at that time. All incidents can only be decided after meeting with Sun. We are now watching the outcome of the meeting between Fu and Sun and adopting the final method. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to military reports, Fu Zhankui has passed Linhe and marched westward and stopped on the east bank of the Yellow River, waiting to meet Li Ming. Li is in Dengkou and has reportedly met with Sun, conveying our intentions. Sun feels that the military situation is already difficult, and it is difficult to raise supplies, so he seems to be aware of the situation. Fu will go to Dengkou to meet with Sun after Li returns to persuade him to leave the army. The Jin-Sui army has completed its deployment, and most of them are concentrated in Linhe. Fu Zuoyi will decide his actions after the outcome of the meeting between Fu and Sun. Fu Zuoyi and Men Bingyue are scheduled to go to Baotou first on the 5th, and then to Linhe.

<p>(Beiping) The Jin-Sui army is currently ordered to temporarily gather on the east bank of the Yellow River, waiting for the outcome of the meeting between Fu and Sun before deciding whether to advance. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zhankui arrived in Linhe on the 3rd, waiting for Li Ming to report on the situation of the meeting with Sun before going to Dengkou to persuade Sun to leave the army. It is rumored that Sun may take the opportunity to step down, but according to those familiar with Sun's internal situation, all political power in Sun's troops is in Sun's hands alone, so the possibility of leaving the army is still very small. After Fu Zuoyi returned to Suiyuan, everything was ready. Because peace has not been completely abandoned, the vanguard troops of the Jin-Sui army and Sun's army, Lu Fengnian's troops, are confronting each other at Huangyang Mutou. If there is still no result after Fu meets with Sun, Fu will go to the front to command the implementation of a pincer attack. (4th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Guihua Fu Zhankui, accompanied by Sun Dianying's representatives Hu Jiesan and Ma Ji, left Suiyuan for Baotou on the 3rd to meet with Sun in Ningbian to make friendly persuasion. Fu Zuoyi, Zhao Chengzhou, Wang Jingguo, and Men Bingyue are scheduled to go to Baotou together on the 5th to command the suppression of Sun's military. On the 3rd, the Suiyuan Provincial Government telegraphed the county magistrates of western Suiyuan, stating that the province is concerned that the counties in western Suiyuan lack food, fearing that military rations would hinder civilian food. It has discussed with the 35th Army Headquarters that all large quantities of military grain will be transported from Baotou. However, it is difficult for firewood and grass to be transported from other counties, and the county governments should fully reserve them for use. The price has been paid in advance by the army headquarters. The people of the counties must pay the price immediately when they deliver firewood and grass and must not delay, lest they delay the military operations. They hope to store as much as possible and not delay. (4th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Prospects for the Special Disarmament Conference 慎 <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The disarmament conference, which has been lifeless for a long time, has been unable to proceed smoothly since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations. Recently, British Lord Privy Seal Eden visited political leaders in Paris, Rome, Berlin, and other places regarding the disarmament issue, and presented a British memorandum for discussion. However, the detailed content has not been made public. According to reports, Britain will convene a special disarmament conference in London this month, and the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Belgium, Spain, and the Little Entente countries have been invited to attend. Even Germany, which has withdrawn from the League of Nations, and the Soviet Union, which stands at the other extreme, are included in the list. The United States is also planning to propose an important proposal calling for not using force to invade neighboring countries. If the memorandum proposed by Eden serves as the basis for the conference's proceedings, it will likely be limited to restricting offensive weapons, and its nature will ultimately be a technical issue of armament.</p>
<p>Let us first discuss the situation on the European continent. No country has ever admitted to being prepared to attack another country. The maximum extent is only to ensure security. A strong hegemony like France, which holds the world's first army and air force, and Europe's first huge wealth, and unites with small countries to help itself, has never claimed to have an absolutely offensive weapon. Italy is one step behind France. Whether in Central Europe or North Africa, it is catching up rapidly, trying to compete with France for hegemony. Therefore, it is making every effort to expand its air force. The flying team that crossed the Atlantic Ocean earlier is one of its manifestations. Germany has been under the Versailles Treaty for a long time and is unwilling to be oppressed again, so it resolutely withdrew from the League of Nations to fight for equality in armaments. However, given Germany's current financial resources and national economy, it is difficult to compete with France and Italy in terms of armaments. What it relies on is its people's many years of scientific and technological training and its militaristic spirit. Britain is thinking of mediating between them to maintain the status quo by peaceful means. How could it know that there is Japan in the East, which specializes in plunder, not only exerting efforts to expand its armaments, but also invading everywhere, forcibly occupying our four northeastern provinces, and secretly attacking markets in Southeast Asia, India, and Africa? Recently, it has been blindly advancing, thinking of getting involved in Siberia. The Soviet Union cannot but be on high alert. Therefore, although the increase in armaments by various countries in the world is not yet fully exposed, the prosperity of their military industries is enough to prove that disarmament is difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Furthermore, let us discuss Britain and the United States. Britain can be said to be experienced and sophisticated in diplomacy and solid and reliable in national defense. No navy in the world today can control Britain's destiny. Britain also has the power to maintain a huge fleet of commercial ships and transportation links. However, what is the intention of its Singapore port construction plan and the addition of four new air squadrons? Is it not to prepare for any unforeseen events in the Far East? Is it not to plan for the security of the Indian Ocean? Is it not to consolidate the gateway to the Pacific Ocean? Therefore, although Britain advocates disarmament, it is only a technical argument and a formality at the conference table. The United States is focusing on its industrial recovery plan, sparing no effort, but overseas markets have already been defined, and the path of development in Europe has long been blocked. In South America, the economic opposition between Britain and the United States is difficult to ease, and the economic alliance within the British Empire is restricting the development of the United States everywhere. The Far East market is almost entirely dominated by Japan. The economic advancement of the United States lacks the protection of force. Its domestic general consumption power is also extremely weak. The final way out is to expand into the military industry, such as building 120 warships and newly placing 1,000 bombers, all of which are signs of tension. How can there be any possibility of disarmament?</p>
<p>Now, Austria, with a land as small as a bullet, has added 70,000 troops. Germany is indeed subject to the restrictions of the Versailles Treaty, but its 100,000 troops are all officers. Once a war breaks out, the steel helmet assault team can be turned into an elite force. The German spirit of militarism and the fervor of revenge are repeatedly revealed to the outside world. In short, the major powers do not have sufficient sincerity in disarmament. When a real dispute occurs, they fall into an impasse that cannot be resolved, such as the naval competition between France and Italy, the dispute over maintaining or revising the 5:5:3 ratio of capital ships between Britain, the United States, and Japan, and the military actions in Manchuria. These are all examples. The reason why the world can still barely maintain the status quo is that each country has its own shield and spear, and no strong country dares to blindly provoke. Therefore, after a period of tension, it is followed by a stalemate. The upcoming special disarmament conference, even if there has been considerable communication beforehand, will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the past. To achieve significant disarmament, I am afraid we will have to wait until after the next world war.</p>

Regarding important contacts with diplomacy with China, Foreign Minister Hirota will, based on his aspirations since taking office, make a fundamental understanding of how Japan's relations with Britain and the United States must be resolved depending on how the China problem is resolved, and strive to adjust Sino-Japanese relations as soon as possible, and make the establishment of friendly relations the top priority.

<p>Russian Reporter Vigorously Criticizes Pu Yi's Usurping of the Title</p>
<h3 id="e17">Japan Will Never Be Satisfied with Annexing the Four Northeastern Provinces; Its Ambition Is to Further Plot for the Entirety of China <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The renowned Soviet journalist Radek commented on Puyi's ascension to the throne, saying, "Since the Qing Dynasty was destroyed by the wheel of the Chinese people's revolution in 1911, its last descendants have once again ascended the throne as emperors of Manchuria, riding in armored cars and under the protection of Japanese soldiers. The newspapers of Japanese imperialism even praise him as a guarantor of peace in Manchuria. After the Japanese warlords had the wheel of history roll away the most powerful European royal families such as the Hohenzollerns, Habsburgs, and Romanovs, they then listened to the 'appeals of the Manchurian people' and their own royalist sentiments to bring an empire into the world. Therefore, the newspapers of Japanese imperialism have lavished praise on it."</p>
<p>Ninety Percent of Manchuria's Population Is Han Chinese. The so-called State of Manchuria Is Indeed an Absurd Myth. Ninety percent of Manchuria's population are Han Chinese farmers. When the Qing Dynasty was on the verge of collapse, all the people of China and Manchuria were extremely stable. The clear proof of this phenomenon is that there was absolutely no powerful royalist party in China. The Japanese Kidnapped and Used This Title to Rally Support. The last descendant of the Qing Dynasty was preserved by the Japanese troops stationed in China. The Japanese army protected Puyi with meticulous care. Whenever there was danger, they immediately kidnapped him and hid him in the Japanese concession in Tianjin. As soon as the bell of Manchurian independence rang, they used Japanese warships to transport him to Manchuria." Radek replied to the question of why the Japanese warlords had to establish a new empire, saying, "The purpose of the Japanese warlords in establishing the Manchurian Empire and ordering the last descendant of the Qing Dynasty to become emperor is far beyond Manchuria.</p>
<p>Citing the Story of Wu Sangui. Radek cited Chinese history, saying that Manchuria's entry into China to govern was thanks to Wu Sangui. Wu, troubled by peasant uprisings, was deeply aware of the actions of peasants, so he invited the Manchus to enter China and rule, and to help him suppress the rebellious peasants. "The Japanese warlords firmly believe that there will be many new Wu Sanguis in China. They are threatened by the new high tide of the workers' and peasants' revolution and are all willing to implement Chiang Kai-shek's policies. The Japanese warlords have this in mind, so they created an empire and ordered Puyi to ascend the throne and occupy Manchuria. This is by no means the final goal of the most decisive Japanese imperialists. Jehol or Inner Mongolia cannot satisfy their desires.</p>
<p>Preparing for Further Aggression. These movements are all preliminary preparations for future advances. The Japanese warlords and fascists are particularly horrified by the idea of a unified China. Once China, with its 400 million people, is unified, and has new tools of production and new weapons, it will drastically change the composition of power in the world, and the composition of power in Asia will be completely changed. The Japanese warlords are worried that if China takes the path of capitalism, it will only follow the lead of the United States; if it takes the path of socialism, it will rely on the Soviet Union. The above paths are of no use to those who desire to rule Asia. Some Japanese soldiers hope to divide China's territory as much as possible, while others attempt to rule a unified China with Japanese imperialism. They believe that the deepening of class struggle in China will cause the ruling groups of Chinese landlords and capitalists to take refuge in Manchuria, with Japanese bayonets as protection. In this way, the Japanese will drive straight into the Yangtze River basin. The slogan they use will certainly not be annexation, but to unify China with the legitimate government of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, Japanese imperialism will seize all the most important positions in China with the qualifications of the backstage power. This is the meaning of Puyi's ascension to the throne.</p>
<p>Striving for Leadership in Asia. When Puyi ascended the throne relying on Japanese bayonets, he declared to the world the historical mission he would carry out. He declared to the world, "The so-called State of Manchuria will be sandwiched between the Soviet Union and the East, and will be a fortress to prevent the Red Scare in the Far East. Is its contribution to the world not great?" The Japanese warlords hope to intimidate the imperialist world with the Red Scare crisis, thereby seeking to expand their own power in China, while weakening the resistance of other imperialist powers. Puyi and his backstage bosses hope not only to be anti-Soviet, but also to strive for Japan's leadership in Asia.</p>
<p>Ultimately, It Is Difficult to Escape the Fate of History. People all have their hopes. Puyi's hope for his fortress does not bother us. We will make Puyi, who is entrenched in the Changchun "fortress," and his advisors, meet their historical fate." Radek pointed out in his conclusion that there is now a young and brave working class in China, which is full of vitality and can lead the masses of peasants. "Puyi's ancestors had their philosophical deduction that, regardless of north or south, the rebellion of the people will place the country under the power of a just ruler. Puyi's advisors can be considered clever if they do not try to relive this conclusion, as it will tear down their throne, and not be limited to Puyi's throne," he said. (TASS dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from the Japanese Association in Batavia to the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, the Dutch East Indies government has already implemented import restrictions on cement, beer, cotton fabrics, and bleached cotton. This time, it is preparing to implement a complete import restriction on general merchandise such as cretonne, gas cotton cloth, rayon fabric, molias, ceramics, black enamel ironware, paper, soap, benia boxes, and pigments. The purpose of the restriction is to suppress Japanese goods, or even to expel Japanese import merchants and retailers in the area. In addition, regarding ship insurance and warehouse operations, the Dutch East Indies government also intends to seize them from the Japanese and return them to the Dutch. Once the above import restrictions are implemented, Japanese stores in the area will collapse overnight, which is a matter of life and death for 7,000 Japanese expatriates.

<p>(Berlin) An official statement was released today, implying that Britain's renewed mediation on disarmament would be futile. It is said that when Britain acted as mediator, it obtained concessions from Germany, which France accepted, but France still maintained its position and assigned Britain the task of extracting further concessions from Germany. This French tactic is deceiving Britain's unremitting efforts at mediation and cannot last long, as the possibility of Germany continuing to make concessions has now been exhausted. The minimum program for German armament equality with other countries, as set by German Chancellor Hitler, is a complete and constructive solution that cannot be reduced. It is also said that Germany's demands for security and equality cannot be met now due to France's opposition. Therefore, any future mediation, regardless of its origin, can only be directed towards France, as the obstacles in the agreement are entirely on the French side. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>Seeking New Methods of Propaganda in Austria</p>
<p>Avoiding Difficulties in International Diplomacy</p>
<p>Rosenberg Explains the Tasks of the National Socialist Party</p>
<p>Vienna The German National Socialist Party propagandist Hape Hitto previously issued a warning to the Austrian government in the form of an ultimatum, saying that it would temporarily suspend attacks on Austria within a week, and that after February 28, if a satisfactory answer could not be obtained, it would resume the attacks. However, since the deadline has expired, except for a small disturbance by the Austrian National Socialist Party within the province of Tyrol, the German National Socialist Party has taken no action. Responsible parties here say that the reason why it is temporarily presenting a truce is not due to any new facts in German-Austrian relations. The real reason may be that Germany is seeking other propaganda methods to enable National Socialist Partyism to penetrate Austria without causing diplomatic difficulties. It will take some time to discuss and prepare this new method. The reason why it has taken no action against Austria for the time being may be due to this. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

The main point is that the German people must all take the same attitude. Roughly, one idea that Chancellor Hitler has cherished for the longest time will one day be realized. The idea is that the National Socialist Party cadres, who are currently led by one person, will certainly be led by an organization in the future. This organization is the crystallization of the National Socialist Party movement and represents absolute authority."

<p>Determining Four Fundamental Principles</p>
<p>Designating the Philippine Islands as a Buffer Zone</p>
<p>Opinions from the Navy Ministry Are Gradually Rising</p>
<p>(Tokyo) With the World Disarmament Conference approaching next year, Japan's fundamental principles in this regard are roughly based on the following four items to create a specific proposal: (1) Ensure national defense security; (2) Maintain the right to equal armament; (3) Eliminate the doctrine of naval category and proportional restrictions; (4) Limit armament due to the free construction of ships under the doctrine of total tonnage, that is, Japan always stands on the fundamental principle of mutual non-aggression. If legitimate demands are not recognized and the conference breaks down, the responsibility should be borne by the United Kingdom and the United States. Recently, within the Navy Ministry, the following informal opinions have gradually risen, causing attention from all parties: regarding the independence of the Philippine Islands, based on the absolute trust between the United States and Japan, guarantee the independence and neutrality of the Philippine Islands, with the island as a non-defensive buffer zone. In addition, Qam Island is the same as Japan's mandated rule in the South Pacific. Cancel the restriction of the Western Pacific defense agreement and restore the free defense state before the conclusion of the Washington Treaty. Then the United States will completely entrust the maintenance of peace in the Far East to Japan, enjoy the benefits of the open door and equal opportunity in the Orient, and establish a policy agreement such as this to sweep away the suspicions between the two countries. The two countries will restore a true friendly relationship. At that time, because the Philippine Islands are a buffer zone, the anxiety of the United Kingdom's Australia and other Pacific coastal territories can be eliminated. At the 1935 disarmament conference, naval armament issues can be easily resolved according to the above four fundamental principles of Japan. (Dian Tong News on the 4th)</p>

<p>Various Factions Observe That the Current Cabinet Will Inevitably Collapse Sooner or Later</p>
<p>After the Closing of Parliament, Saito Will Visit Prince Saionji to Determine His Course of Action</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito will wait until the current parliament is completed, restore the party situation with the Seiyukai, and then replenish cabinet members to remain in the cabinet. However, during this parliament, due to the replacement of two core cabinet members, the public is quite dissatisfied with the current cabinet's policies and measures. Therefore, after the completion of this parliament, due to the political situation, it is also believed that some people will resign. But all the mysteries are in the mind of Elder Prince Saionji. Therefore, after the completion of parliament, Prime Minister Saito will visit Prince Saionji to decide his course of action. (Dian Tong News on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The political developments after the resignation of Minister of Education Hatoyama are now being watched by all parties. The observations of various political parties also differ depending on their positions and are completely in a chaotic state. The observations of various political parties are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>"Seiyukai" has two opposing observations: (1) The current cabinet continues to have problems with discipline. Ministers Nakajima and Hatoyama have resigned one after another. Regardless of the reasons for their resignation, Prime Minister Saito's responsibility for reporting to the Emperor is inevitable. Moreover, the opinions of Ministers Goto and Nagai differ on the issue of rice control within the cabinet, exposing the disunity of the cabinet. Moreover, those who should oppose the current cabinet have generally disappeared, so there is no expectation and it cannot continue. Although it may pass through parliament, it will inevitably collapse. As for the replenishment of Minister of Education Hatoyama, since there is no negotiation with the Seiyukai and no indication of any kind, it is to understand the situation in between. (2) It is said that the reason for not replenishing Minister of Education Hatoyama's re-appointment is that if the budget is approved, the parliament will replenish it again. This is a cunning method of Prime Minister Saito's faction to alleviate the opposition air of the House of Peers. After the completion of the parliament, they will seek a strategy to stay in the cabinet for a long time. Therefore, either under the pretext that a successor has not been obtained, or that Prince Saionji does not want a political change, they will replenish the Minister of Education alone, or implement a partial reorganization of the cabinet to seek a long-term stay. As for the Seiyukai itself, because of the current political situation, even if a political change occurs, the party has no hope of political power, so it will temporarily maintain the status quo and wait until the atmosphere of restoring the party cabinet is brewing before hoping to resign en masse.</p>
<p>"Minseito" Now that Minister of Education Hatoyama has resigned, the budget and the rural relief budget should be passed safely. Also, the issue of control of foreign rice has also been in accordance with the hopes of the House of Representatives and should be decided soon. The result may be to pass through parliament, but after the completion of parliament, due to the difficulty of replenishing the Minister of Education, it is said that there will be a general resignation, but Ministers Takahashi and Yamamoto both agree to maintain the cabinet, so the result is always a smooth solution, and the budget for the fiscal year of Showa 10 will also be prepared.</p>
<p>"National Alliance" The current cabinet does not show any reflection on our party's motion of no confidence. This parliament may be able to pass safely, but it has completely exposed the incompetence of the current cabinet. Therefore, after the parliament, the prime minister will visit Saionji to express his intention to resign. As for the successor cabinet, it is not a party cabinet, which can be asserted. This parliament is an excellent opportunity for political parties to restore credibility, but they have lost credibility due to the problem of discipline. As for the successor cabinet, it must be a powerful cabinet that can open up the national policy in extraordinary times and can implement it. Therefore, the Hiranuma cabinet is more suitable.</p>
<p>"House of Peers" Since both Ministers Nakajima and Hatoyama have resigned from the current cabinet, the House of Peers does not want to take the responsibility for overthrowing the current cabinet and will not actively attack the current government. However, the current cabinet has no means to open up extraordinary times, so at this time, the House of Peers should have an expression of intent. As for the re-appointment of the Minister of Education, the person recommended by Seiyukai President Suzuki does not meet the government's expectations, and the Seiyukai does not want to hear what the government wants. If it is sought outside the political parties, it will break away from the Seiyukai, and a political crisis will occur. If so, then the current cabinet is about to reach the handover period.

<p>Japanese Representatives Will Propose a Recess</p>
<p>To Avoid Responsibility for Rupture</p>
<p>Osaka Regarding the Joint Committee on Countermeasures for British-Japanese Trade Negotiations, opinions have already been unified regarding the timing of the withdrawal of cotton industry representatives, namely: (1) In order to avoid the rupture of the negotiations, after observing the progress of the fourth meeting on the 7th, instruct the delegation to propose a recess to the United Kingdom and immediately carry out the withdrawal; (2) Until that time, firmly advocate the established policy and never concede. Also, after the committee adjourned yesterday, Chairman Kawabe issued a statement in the form of a speech as follows: (1) It is regrettable that the United Kingdom proposed an agreement on third-country markets that could not be implemented at the beginning of the meeting, putting the negotiations on the verge of collapse; (2) If the world market is to be the scope of the agreement, a world cotton industry conference should be held to agree on the production and export of cotton products. It is illegal to restrict exports only to Japan; (3) Japan is also negotiating with the Netherlands, Turkey, Egypt, Africa, etc., so an agreement on third-country markets is impossible; (4) It is heard that if Japan does not agree to the third-country market agreement, the British government will completely prevent Japanese cotton cloth and rayon from being imported to threaten Japan. If the negotiations break down, it will further stand on a common front with European countries to prevent Japanese goods. If this is the case, it is regrettable for international trade and British-Japanese relations. (Dian Tong News on the 4th)</p>

<p>Resolve to Punish Severely According to the Law</p>
<p>Ticket Stubs Obtained in a Major Fraud Case</p>
<p>Recipients of Funds Are Frightened and Anxious</p>
<p>(Paris) Tonight, Justice Minister Scherron issued a declaration, "The government will continue to handle the Stavisky fraud case with severe measures. The murderer who murdered Paris Court of Appeals Judge Purinschi must be captured and brought to justice. We will not hesitate to use various methods to achieve this goal. Recently, foxes and rats have been running rampant without any scruples, and the country has suffered deeply. It is inevitable to punish severely according to the law." It is said that he had met with Mr. Shi five or six times in a tavern, and had also met with Mr. Shi's wife twice. As for Congressman Ponor (who had received Mr. Shi's assistance in the election and is now in custody), he only happened to meet him at a dinner party somewhere. According to reports in the Paris Echo, the Stavisky checkbook stubs have now been found. It is still unknown who handed them over to the police. At yesterday's State Council meeting, Interior Minister Sarro did not want to name the name, only saying that these stubs were purchased and not voluntarily handed over. It is now heard that the person who handed over the stubs has left Paris. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Many important people in France are very afraid today, fearing that the names recorded in the checkbook stubs of Stavisky, the protagonist of the major fraud case, will be made public. There are 1,200 numbers of these stubs, and the amount of expenditure is about 2.5 million pounds in English gold. They all contain the names of the recipients and the date of issue, and are in Mr. Shi's own handwriting. It is heard that most of this huge sum was obtained by lawyers, judges, and politicians who protected him. The authorities are now protecting these stubs very closely. In addition to being monitored and photographed by responsible persons, these important documents are properly placed in the iron box in the office of the presiding judge. If the stubs are slightly lost, it is estimated that the most important parts are lost. The police believe that Mr. Stavisky's wife must know about it, but it is still questionable whether Mr. Shi's wife is willing to announce it. These stubs will be handed over to the Congressional Investigation Committee for storage in the future. Mr. Li Gaode, who had received Mr. Shi's check, was arrested today. Li claimed to have received 700,000 francs from Mr. Shi, but this sum was transferred to the Fulinte newspaper. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>Madrid - Spanish Catholic leader Robel stated today that if the government proposes any bills that oppose Catholicism, he will certainly rise up and overthrow it. From this, it can be seen that if the right wing does not cooperate, the new cabinet is unlikely to last for long. The new cabinet has already shown a conservative trend, and whether it can be stable is still uncertain. There are rumors that a general strike will occur on Monday. If it is not resolved immediately, it may affect the whole country once it breaks out. Therefore, after the establishment of the new cabinet, its first task is to organize a committee to mediate the current severe labor unrest and eliminate future troubles. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

Samuel said, "Democracy should strive for efficiency, perseverance, and the ability to carry out construction work. This is precisely what the current government has failed to satisfy. The current cabinet in Britain is in a state of sleep.

<p>Japan's Military Occupation of Northeast China</p>
<p>Has an Unfavorable Impact on China's Finances</p>
<p>International Assistance Received Is Only Empty Words of Morality</p>
<p>American Financiers' Statements of Putting the Cart Before the Horse Are Strange</p>
<p>(Berlin) - The declaration on China's economic construction issued by Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan of China, has recently been widely valued by German newspapers. The "German General Newspaper" published an article today stating that Wang's declaration was issued precisely at the time when the puppet Pu Yi claimed the title of Emperor, which may not be an accidental coincidence. The land in Northeast China is fertile and rich in raw material production, and suitable for cultivation. It is equally important in terms of imports and exports. Now that it has been forcibly separated by a strong neighbor, it will have a very serious impact on China's economic development. China's financial status, foreign trade, etc., will all be unfavorably affected. Moreover, the harm caused by the invasion of the three northeastern provinces indirectly is more than this. For example, the increasing rampant nature of the Communist bandits and the increasing internal strife are all caused by the weakening of the authority of the Chinese government. We all know that the three northeastern provinces were not invaded at a time when the world economy was in distress and natural and man-made disasters had not yet occurred. Therefore, the Chinese government's efforts to unite and develop in both political and economic aspects had already seen considerable achievements. However, since then, the only thing that countries around the world can do to assist China is a moral verdict from the League of Nations, which is still empty words without any practical effect. Even international finance has not provided any assistance to China, as evidenced by the strange attitude taken by American financiers Morgan and his colleague Lamont. Lamont once stated at a meeting of the International Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam, "If China can never manage its household well, foreign countries will never be willing to assist the Chinese government again." This kind of declaration is truly putting the cart before the horse. It is unexpected that it would come from the mouth of a famous financier like Lamont, which is truly strange. The reason why China's internal affairs are not in order is because China cannot obtain money in foreign markets. Looking back on the activities of various countries in China's finances over the past century, it can be seen that all the current financial difficulties in China are caused by international financial manipulation.

<p>Requested by Our Government</p>
<p>Has Obtained Understanding from the US Side</p>
<p>(Nanjing) - After the US$50 million cotton and wheat loan contract was established in New York, purchasing agencies successively shipped them to China in batches, and the amount of sales was limited to be used as the funding for construction and production projects. However, our country had a bumper harvest of wheat and cotton last year, and the consumption was almost self-sufficient, so there was no need to purchase a large number from abroad. Therefore, it was not possible to purchase and transport as much as stipulated in the original contract. The government authorities tactfully negotiated with the US side to reduce the original amount of the loan, and it is rumored that the consent of the US authorities has been obtained. However, the amount of the reduction has not been specifically resolved. Our government authorities intend to reduce the original amount of the loan of 50 million by 20 million to 25 million, and the goods purchased with the loan are limited to wheat and cotton. Everything that our country needs is the principle of purchase and transportation. It is rumored that the US authorities fully understand our country's request, but there is still a difference in the amount of reduction. The US side has agreed to reduce the amount by 10 million, and both sides are still consulting these days, and the opinions are very close, and a decision will be made soon.

<h3 id="e87">New Policies After the American Blue Eagle Movement (New York Correspondence) <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Reducing Currency Value to Develop Foreign Trade</p>
<p>Recovering Overseas Loans to Overcome Economic Panic</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the Blue Eagle Movement, the American economy seems to have improved, and people generally express their happiness. However, in fact, the goods manufactured by factories are still stacked in warehouses, and only a small minority is consumed by consumers. Moreover, most people are still poor, and the extent of their poverty has not diminished compared to before the implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act. Therefore, most Americans, who used to live in New York and only knew how to blindly enjoy themselves and follow fashion, now only know how to complain. They have given up their private cars and are riding rental cars. Those who cannot afford rental cars are riding public buses. The enjoyment of life has decreased, but few people are still investigating the causes of the economic panic. Political interest is still very cold. British foreign policy, French strategies, Japanese aggressive invasion, and German fierce pursuit all seem irrelevant to American society. They do not pay close attention to these political and economic situations with enthusiasm. Everything abroad absolutely cannot outweigh their enthusiasm for trade and accumulating money. Even the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union is more of a calculation for expanding trade than a political implication.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no longer a golden age like the early days of the European War for the United States to fully develop. The markets of overseas countries are occupied by strong competitors, and consumers are very weak. They do not have much spare capacity to enjoy American expensive products. European consumers have relatively greater purchasing power, but each country is closing its doors to be self-sufficient. Therefore, the implementation of the Blue Eagle Movement, shortening working hours, increasing wages, and reducing capitalists' profits, is a new transformation of capital organization and a new method in 1933. However, the effect is still very small and cannot be considered a solution to the urgent situation in the United States. If this continues, not only will it be impossible to overcome the panic, but even temporary stability cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>Therefore, new tricks are being tried again. This is the method of reducing the pure gold content of the American dollar, which was announced on January 31. According to this method, the new gold dollar is 15 grams cold and twenty-one and five points (the old US dollar is 25.8 grams cold), which is 59.06 percent of the old currency. The reduced component is about 41 percent. Due to the decrease in currency value, the government can obtain a profit of 2.686 billion US dollars, but 2 billion US dollars will be drawn from it as a fund to stabilize the currency. The reasons why the American president wants to adopt an inflationary policy are approximately the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) The turnover in the financial sector is also gradually becoming less flexible. There are few industrial investments, so interest rates naturally decrease. The public works projects undertaken by the government are very limited in terms of production significance, so monetary inflation policy must be used to support finance and increase its monopoly power, while stimulating emerging industries.</p>
<p>(2) The US dollar has indeed fallen in international exchange rates, but it is not stable, so the export of goods has not seen a rapid increase. American products overseas still cannot compete with Japan and Britain. This is why the currency value is simply reduced to seek an increase in the price of goods, while seeking benefits from exporting abroad.</p>
<p>(3) Most of the United States' foreign investments are frozen and difficult to recover. Although there is more than one reason for the freeze, the excessively high exchange rate of the US dollar is one of the important reasons. In the future, if the value of the US dollar is reduced, the recovery of investment will be easier. At the same time, debtors at home will also get a little benefit. If most people can repay their debts, the circulation of finance will be more prosperous.</p>
<p>(4) The US government will issue 600 billion US dollars of government bonds before June of this year. In the current situation, the American people may not have the ability to consume them, and the unstable currency value also prevents people from investing lightly. The current method can stabilize the currency price, and people will be happy to invest, so there is hope for the government's financial resources.</p>
<p>This is the hope of the Roosevelt government, and also the hope of the general American public, hoping to gradually restore the past prosperity from this. But in reality, will it be like the Blue Eagle Movement? It is still a question. It is not easy to truly get a solution. (February 1, 1934)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Japanese Army in Tianjin Conducts Demonstration Exercise <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Exercise Location Is Actually in the Hinterland of Hebei</p>
<p>The General Affairs Office of the Jinpu Railway Arbitrarily Allocates Cars</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence, Today (the 1st) is the date of Puyi's usurpation in Guanwai. The Japanese army stationed in Tianjin specially held a large-scale exercise. At 4:00 AM, the Japanese army, led by Commander of the Garrison Army Nakamura Koutaro, took a train to Jinghai County on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line south of Tianjin. At 8:00 AM, they began field exercises. It is said that this exercise by the Japanese army has actually exceeded the scope of previous exercises. Its meaning is probably to take advantage of Puyi's usurpation to demonstrate to the people of North China. A week ago, the Commander of the Japanese Garrison Army sent a letter to the Hebei Provincial Government regarding the location of the exercise, stating that on March 1, he would conduct field exercises in Liangwangzhuang, Duliuhe, and Tangguantun on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line in Jinghai County, south of Tianjin, and requested our side to allow it and inform the people. On the one hand, he sent personnel to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau to request the allocation of cars. Shi Yuxiao, who was in Ping, instructed the foreign affairs secretary of the provincial government to reply to the Japanese side by telephone, telling them that Jinghai belongs to the interior of Hebei and foreign troops cannot be allowed to conduct exercises there. After receiving the reply, the Japanese army sent another letter, raising three points: (1) A few years ago, the Chinese government allowed American troops to conduct an exercise in the area, which means that the area has a precedent for allowing foreign troops to conduct exercises. Based on this point, Japanese troops must also be allowed to conduct exercises. (2) A few years ago, the Japanese army conducted exercises in Daxing County, Hebei. Daxing and Jinghai both belong to Hebei counties. Since exercises were allowed in Daxing, they should also be allowed in Jinghai. (3) Last year, the Hebei Provincial Government allowed the Japanese army to conduct exercises in Nankou. What is the difference between Jinghai and Nankou? Moreover, they are both on the railway line, and Jinghai should not be declared as the hinterland. The wording of the letter was firm, indicating that there was no possibility of granting the request. Shi Yuxiao then forwarded the request to the Military Branch Political Committee in Ping for review. However, both committees have not yet responded. The Japanese side directly contacted Gao Hengru, the Chief of the General Affairs Office of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, to negotiate the allocation of cars. Gao actually did not ask his superiors and privately agreed, and allocated a train of cars, parked at Tianjin East Station for the Japanese army to use. Secretly, he instructed the Japanese to negotiate with the Hebei Provincial Government. If they obtained an order from the provincial government, he would immediately drive the train. The Japanese army headquarters then sent personnel to visit Shi Yuxiao. Since Shi Yuxiao was in Ping and had not returned, they urgently urged the responsible person of the provincial government to reply. Shi Yuxiao, upon hearing the news in Ping, returned to Tianjin on the evening of February 28. The Japanese side then sent personnel to meet Shi Yuxiao, demanding an order to drive the train. Shi Yuxiao said that traffic matters are the responsibility of the traffic authorities, so how could the provincial government be forced to issue an order? He then summoned Gao Hengru to inquire. At this point, Gao stated the truth, saying that he had received a telegram from the General Bureau a few days ago, prohibiting him from allocating cars for the Japanese army. The car affairs office, upon receiving the order, disbanded the train that had been allocated. However, because the Japanese were pestering him, he could not refuse, so he had agreed, but he did not dare to act arbitrarily, fearing responsibility, so he pushed it to the provincial government. Shi Yuxiao then became displeased. However, because Gao had already privately promised, he could not go back on his word. In order to maintain national rights and the prestige of the province, he showed the telegram from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway General Bureau to the Japanese side, telling them that the authority did not belong to the provincial government and they could negotiate with the Railway Bureau. At this point, the Japanese side knew that it was not the responsibility of the provincial government and turned to pressure Gao Hengru again. Gao could not withstand the intimidation of the Japanese and, in his private capacity, coordinated with the Beining Railway Bureau for a train of cars. Today (the 1st), a special train was opened to Jinghai, carrying the Japanese army. It is estimated that about 300 Japanese soldiers went by train, and the majority marched on foot. The exercise will last for four days. The participating troops include about 300 infantry, cavalry, and artillery, as well as three tanks and six armored vehicles, divided into attacking and defending teams, conducting large-scale exercises along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. It is hoped that the authorities are clearly aware that the Japanese army is demonstrating. Because the Tianjin-Pukou Railway arbitrarily allocated cars, the Japanese army was able to travel without permission. It is feared that once this precedent is set, the Japanese army may request to conduct marches and exercises in our inland areas at any time in the future. Therefore, it is proposed to telegraph the Ministry of Railways to investigate Gao Hengru for allocating cars. (March 1)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Mutual Killing of Minnan Quanzhou-Yongchun Militias <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Hong Wende Occupies Yongchun</p>
<p>Zhang Xiongnan Defends Dehua</p>
<p>Both Sides Aiming for Territory</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, With the end of military affairs in Fujian Province, the complex militia problem is the biggest issue. Recently, the old troops of Chen Guohui, the largest force in the Quanzhou area, led by Hong Wende, and the Dehua militia of Zhang Xiongnan are killing each other in Anxi. Zhang's troops are stationed in Yongchun, and Hong's troops are stationed in Nan'an. The war was launched on February 26. Hong's troops attacked Zhang in three routes: the central route led by Peng Tang, the western route led by Chen Yucai. Peng Tang's Nan'an First Detachment, Peng Deshan, departed from Jintao and joined Li Zhong, Zheng Mingzhi, etc. in Shishan to form the central route, directly attacking Yongchun via the Quanzhou-Yongchun-Dehua highway. Chen Yucai dispatched the recently incorporated remnants of the 19th Route Army, Shi Baoqi's unit, from Anxi to attack Dapu, to intercept Zhang's retreat from Penghu via Sukeng to Dehua. Hong also transferred Liu Chaoran's unit from Jinbei to the eastern route, attacking the eastern gate of Yongchun via Badu, leaving three or four squads in the Lijiuzhi area to block Zhang's retreat to Dehua. On the morning of the 26th, the central route, Peng Tang, arrived near Nanwushi, at the border of Nan'an and Yongchun, and made contact with the vanguard of Zhang's troops. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle. Zhang's troops were unable to resist and retreated to Xiaohu at noon. Peng's troops continued to advance and engaged in battle again in Xiaohu for several hours. Zhang's troops originally only had one company stationed in Xiaohu and then added two more companies, but they were still outnumbered and retreated again to Yongchun County. Peng took advantage of the victory to pursue and seized Niutouzhai. The vanguard advanced to the airfield outside the county seat. Zhang urgently transferred a large force to meet the enemy. Peng's troops, fearing encirclement due to the failure of the left and right wings to arrive at the same time, retreated out of Yongchun and back to Niutouzhai, where they were ambushed by Zhang's troops. Zheng Yonglai, the battalion commander of Peng's troops, was killed in action. They retreated to Wupushan in Nan'an. Zhang's troops pursued and engaged in a fierce battle at Changtan Bridge, on the border of Nan'an and Yongchun. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. The battle ended late in the evening. On the morning of the 27th, Peng Tang again dispatched a large force on more than ten trucks and counterattacked Yongchun. Hong Wende also transferred Liu Chaoran's troops to Shishan that day. Liu personally led the Tianying and Liu's directly subordinate units, a total of more than 500 people, departing from Heshi and Shishan, joining Peng Tang's 800-plus troops, with Liu's Tianying as the vanguard, to counterattack Yongchun. Zhang Xiongnan's troops, defending Changtan Bridge, Nanwushi, and Xiaohu, were unable to resist and retreated while fighting. By about 4:00 PM, Zhang's troops had retreated to Huangtianyang, and Peng's troops occupied Xiaohu, confronting Zhang's troops. At the same time, Hong's western route, Chen Yucai, with Shi Baoqi's regiment as the vanguard, advanced to Dapu in Yongchun and also made contact with Zhang Xiongnan's troops, then occupied Dapu. At this point, the important points of Yongchun County were all occupied by Hong's troops. On the morning of the 28th, Zhang's troops abandoned Yongchun and retreated to Dehua. Hong's troops then occupied Yongchun County. Hong Wende also arrived in Yongchun and, on March 1, gathered his main forces, with Shi Baoqi's unit as the vanguard, and continued to advance towards Dehua. The war is unlikely to end easily. It is said that Wei Lihuang has sent personnel to investigate and, after obtaining the truth, will report to the military and political leaders for review. Before the event, the Fifth Route Headquarters received a large number of telegrams from Hong and Zhang mutually exposing each other.</p>
<p>The reasons for the conflict between Hong and Zhang can be explained separately: (1) Distant Cause: During the heyday of Chen Guohui when he served as the commander of the First Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, he unified Quanzhou and Yongchun, but Zhang Xiongnan of Dehua refused to submit. Zhang was a local gentry in Dehua, occupying Dehua for many years and benefiting from its terrain. Chen entered Dehua several times to attack Zhang, confiscating more than 1,000 weapons from Zhang's troops, but was ultimately unable to eliminate Zhang. When the 19th Route Army entered Fujian and resolved Chen Guohui's troops, Chen was shot in the province. Chen's troops, Peng Tang, Chen Yucai, and Chen Peiyu's three regiments, were surrounded by the 19th Route Army and their weapons were confiscated. They retreated to Shuikou in Dehua, but Zhang cut off their retreat, causing Peng Tang's entire army to surrender their weapons. Chen Peiyu and Chen Yucai also had four-fifths of their weapons confiscated. Zhang obtained 3,000 weapons and more than 20 machine guns, greatly increasing his power. The 19th Route Army divided its troops to surround Zhang, but due to the unfavorable terrain, they ultimately had no way to deal with him. When the Central Army entered Fujian this time, Yang Fengnian incorporated Chen and Zhang's troops into the Minnan Punitive Army, with Hong Wende as the commander of the First Route. Zhang also served as the commander of the Third Detachment, but the two major forces stood side by side and had old hatred, which is why they killed each other. (2) Recent Cause: Zhang occupied Yongchun when the 19th Route Army retreated. However, Yongchun was the fundamental base of Chen Guohui's old troops. When Chen Guohui entered Quanzhou in the past, Peng Tang was stationed in Yongchun for more than two years. Now that the 19th Route Army has been defeated, Peng Tang, Chen Yucai, Chen Peiyu, Liu Chaoran, and others are doing their best to expand their strength, indiscriminately incorporating scattered troops, buying up the lost weapons of the 19th Route Army, and taking in the remnants of the 19th Route Army, Shi Baoqi, Ma Hongxing, and Huang Ying, claiming to have 10,000 people, confined to the corners of Nan'an Jinbei and the border of Anxi, requiring 2,000 yuan in food expenses every day. Zhang Xiongnan also had a large increase in troops, and provisions were waiting to be raised. Both sides set up checkpoints to levy taxes, and conflicts occurred frequently between Nan'an and Yongchun. Peng Tang was stationed in Shishan, which was particularly affected. Recently, dozens of telegraph poles were cut down between Shishan and Yongchun. Peng Tang sent a team to patrol Nanwushi, on the border of Nan'an and Yongchun. Zhang Xiongnan, upon hearing the report, transferred a large force from Xiaohu, and the two sides made contact once. Later, You Sifu's unit, with more than 300 bandits, originally contacted Zhang Xiongnan to surrender, but suddenly changed their allegiance to Chen Yucai, which greatly displeased Zhang and accelerated the opportunity for war. However, both sides still confronted each other between Dapu Penghu and Nanwushi Mountain. On the morning of the 26th, Hong's troops launched an attack, and the war began. Moreover, both sides aimed to gain territory to support their troops. Therefore, how to reduce the number of the huge militia at present, how to provide provisions, and prevent them from acting outside the law are major problems for the aftermath of the Fujian situation.

<p>A Plan to Jointly Suppress the Communist Bandits in Jiangxi Is Confirmed</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, Jiang Dingwen came to Guangdong from Fujian by plane on February 27 and met with Chen Jitang. It is said that the result was very satisfactory. At 9:00 AM on the 1st of this month, Jiang left his residence in Tuisi Garden in Dongshan and drove to Chen Jitang's private residence in Meihua Village. After talking for a while, he went to the headquarters with Chen to convene a military conference. Those present included important military officers such as Yu Hanmou, Miao Peinan, Deng Longguang, Huang Guangrui, Jiang Xiyuan, Zhang Zhiying, Du Yiqian, and Tang Haoqing. The plan to suppress the bandits, which Jiang and Chen had been negotiating for days, was submitted for discussion. (4) Regarding the time for the general attack on the bandit areas, it is planned to start in late March. Before the attack begins, each area should clear out the Communist elements in the vicinity to avoid future troubles. At noon, Jiang also went to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee for a banquet. Those present included Chen Jitang, Zou Lu, Deng Zeru, Deng Qingyang, Zhang Renmin, Liu Jiwen, Yu Hanmou, Miao Peinan, and Deng Longguang. During the banquet, Jiang Dingwen talked about the process of pacifying the Fujian Incident and the future progress of suppressing the bandits. Around 1:00 PM, the guests and hosts dispersed in joy. It is also said that Jiang's visit was to exchange views on the plan to suppress the bandits with Li Zongren of Guangxi. He once telegraphed Li, requesting him to come to Guangdong for face-to-face discussions. Later, Li replied by telegram, saying that he was tied down by official duties in Guilin and could not find time to come. The matter of discussing bandit suppression could be communicated by telegram. Therefore, Jiang did not get to meet with Li Zongren. (March 2)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Military Situation on the Fujian-Guangdong Border <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>| Punitive Army Will Jointly Attack Ruijin |</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence, The bandit forces in northern and western Fujian have been very rampant recently, and the military authorities are paying great attention to them. Communist bandits appear and disappear unpredictably in the areas of Changting, Liancheng, and Longyan. The remnants of the 19th Route Army in Longyan, after being reorganized by the Guangdong side into the Independent Third Brigade, entered the territory of Dapu County on the 23rd and transferred to Xingning and Wuhua to be stationed and trained. Deng Longguang's division, originally stationed in the area, returned to defend the counties under Huizhou. Five hundred students from the 19th Route Army's military academy also returned to Xingning, and it is said that they will return to Guangzhou to enroll in the Yantang Military Academy. There are still more than 2,000 scattered soldiers, who were sent to the area of Kanshi in Yongding and were received by Huang Renhuan's division. Currently, the situation near Longyan is still maintained by the security team led by Fu Bocui. It is not yet certain whether the Central Army will advance to Longyan at this time. The Guangdong army in Wuping, Shanghang, and Yongding are stationed on the original defense line and have not withdrawn. The Communist bandits in Changting twice attempted to take the opportunity to attack Longyan, but were repelled by the Guangdong army. The Communist bandits in Tinglian are the troops of Luo Binghui and Zhang Dingcheng, whose main force is in Yong'an, Shaxian, Qingliu, and the northern Fujian area. After Jiang Dingwen became the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route Punitive Army, it is said that he plans to set up a headquarters in Zhangzhou and a 行營 in Longyan, in order to contact and advance together with the Guangdong army in Wuhangyong. Currently, the Central Route Punitive Army, Chen Cheng, Wei Lihuang, Zhao Guantao, and other divisions have all moved to northern Fujian and are in contact with the bandits in the areas of Shunchang and Jianning. The date for the joint attack on Changting and Ruijin is not far away.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Overseas Chinese from Siam Arrive in Xiamen Due to Hardship <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Report on the Massacre of Overseas Chinese in Siam</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: A group of seven overseas Chinese, including Su Biaoqi, who were expelled from Siam and returned to their homeland, arrived in Xiamen on the 27th of last month. They reported that on October 28th of last year, in the area of Botongpo, Siam, local Siamese famine victims demanded relief from the government, which led to disturbances. The Siamese government used military force to suppress the unrest and indiscriminately shot, imprisoned, and expelled innocent overseas Chinese. At the same time, Su and others submitted a report to the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Association, requesting them to forward it to the central government for relief. The account of the incident by Su and others is so appalling and heart-wrenching that it is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>1. At 12:00 noon on October 28th last year, in Botongpo, Siam, sudden and loud gunfire was heard from the police station. The order in the streets was immediately disrupted, and shops and residences were closed one after another. The disturbance subsided at 4:00 p.m. This incident occurred because a small number of famine victims hoped for relief from the police station, which affected innocent people. A total of 22 people were shot dead, of whom 13 were confirmed to be good overseas Chinese. The names of the other nine are unknown. Later, the massacre continued with the following victims: Zhang Naiqing on the 29th, Ya Jin and Zheng Cheng on the 30th, and Lin Mei on the 31st, totaling 27 people. Before the incident, the Siamese government had detained five overseas Chinese, none of whom had committed serious crimes. When the incident occurred, they were all shot dead one by one. Among the five, Chen Yajiang was from Jiaying, Guangdong, and was accused of private gambling; Lin was from Guangxi and was accused of private wine brewing; Su Chengchun was from Yongchun, Fujian, and no crime was announced; Luo Shiyi and his son were from Jiaying, Guangdong, and no evidence of any crime was heard. It was found that Su Chengchun was a businessman with no bad habits, owning fifty to sixty acres of rubber plantations. He had an elderly mother, a wife, and four children. Luo Shiyi had an eighty-year-old mother, a wife, and three children. His eldest son, nicknamed Luo Bali, was only fourteen years old. Because his father was arrested innocently by the police, he chased to the police station and was also tied up and suffered the same fate. In the afternoon of November 1st, at 4:00 p.m., the authorities led a large group of police officers, fully armed, to spread throughout the streets. They immediately killed Che Shi from Huizhou, Guangdong; Wei Hao from Chaozhou; Fu Quan from Guangxi; five people including the driver of Xinhexing; one a clerk in a Hetu shop; one a Kelai person; and the other three were collecting rubber liquid in the rubber plantation behind the market. The most tragic was Che Shi, who was peaceful and amiable in life. Twenty years ago, he went to Botongpo to run a grocery store, built houses, and opened hundreds of acres of rubber plantations, with assets of about 100,000 taels of gold. He left behind an eighty-year-old father and a widow and young children. In the afternoon of the 29th, the police station summoned Zhang Naiqing to the yamen and shot him without discrimination. Zhang was 28 years old, from Yongding, Fujian, and a student at Tsinghua University in Beiping. In August of last year, he was hired as the principal of the local Chinese school and had only been in office for three months before being killed. On the 30th, Ya Jin and Zheng Cheng were shot dead. Ya Jin was from Guangdong, over sixty years old, and worked in a garden. That morning, he was plowing when he was suddenly shot. Before he died, he was carried to the police station, where he passed away. Zheng Cheng was from Tong'an, Fujian. Before the chaos occurred, he went to the county office for some matter. On his way home, he heard gunfire and fled to a witch's house for refuge. Three days later, when he wanted to return home, he was killed. On the 11th, Lin Mei was beaten to death by the police with gun butts. Lin was ill and had been detained for several days, cut off from food, moaning and waiting to die. But the cruel and inhumane police beat him to death with gun butts. Moreover, on the morning of the 29th, the local county magistrate and police chief led a large group to the streets, arresting anyone they saw, regardless of whether they were farmers, workers, or merchants, totaling 82 people. They were imprisoned in a small room of ten feet in the police station, which was almost impossible to stand in. The crowd was hot and stuffy, like being near a fire. Although they were hungry and thirsty, they were not given white water. The police beat them randomly with gun butts while searching them, filling their pockets with all the money they could find, amounting to about six or seven hundred yuan or more. As a result, more than ten people suffered from sudden illnesses and fever, and the sound of wailing was endless. In the afternoon of the 30th, the police allowed them to drink water after much pleading. On the 31st, the detainees, because they had not eaten a grain of rice and were starving to death, asked the police for food. The police replied, "The officials want to put you to death, do you still want to eat?" In the afternoon, the deputy police chief was on patrol, and the crowd told him that since the officials intended to put them to death, why not shoot them one by one. The deputy police chief was slightly moved. At dusk, each person was given a small package of rice (the amount of a small bowl). These 82 people were imprisoned until November 3rd, when more than 50 people were released. The rest were still tied to the stone pillars at the foot of the police station, all emaciated and almost starving to death. In total, from October 29th to November 4th, 5th, and 6th, Siamese vagrants were brought to the police station every day to falsely accuse them. On November 16th, the 82 people were divided into three groups. The first group consisted of 47 propertyless people who were bailed out by businesses. The second group of 16 people were sent to Songjiao on the 17th to suffer imprisonment. On January 19th, they were transported by train to Bangkok for detention pending trial. On February 3rd, they were sent to Shantou on the Youlishi ship. The third group of 19 people were taken to Danian in three cars on the morning of November 17th and are still being held in the local prison. It is unknown how they will be dealt with.</p>

<p>All Levels of Personnel Should Purge Themselves of Old Evils</p>
<p>Leaders and Officials Should Cultivate Themselves and Set an Example</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, while supervising the troops in Hankou, previously issued an order to the military and political authorities of all provinces to prohibit indulgence in feasting and entertainment. Yesterday, he reiterated the previous order, stating, "It is through adversity that we can survive, and indulgence only invites calamity. Moreover, in the face of internal and external troubles and numerous disasters, we are in a precarious situation. Every time I think of the soldiers on the front lines, their bones exposed on the battlefield, and the countless victims filling the ditches, I find it hard to sleep. Anyone with a conscience should be aware of the impending danger and should be vigilant, diligent, and introspective. However, a comfortable and decadent lifestyle has become a common practice, with endless singing and dancing taken for granted, pursuing pleasure and seeking only temporary security. If this continues, how can we encourage self-improvement and reverse the decline? From the date of this order, all military commanders at all levels and administrative personnel in all provinces shall cease banquets and eliminate unnecessary social gatherings. Moreover, opium and gambling can erode ambition, waste time, and are a great scourge that destroys the country and the family. Strict prohibitions should be enforced and diligently implemented. All public officials should strictly abide by the prohibitions and purge themselves of old evils. Leaders and officials should cultivate themselves and set an example, so as to achieve great benefits through small acts of integrity. Anyone who disobeys in secret will be severely punished without leniency upon discovery." (March 3rd)</p>

<p>On the 25th of last month, two Japanese men resembling merchants, carrying guns and without passports, came to Jiading from Shanghai by car. The Snowball Garden in the city is privately owned by the Hu family and is located in a remote western part of the city, rarely visited by tourists. However, it was used as a field hospital when the Japanese army invaded. Some say that the Japanese went there because they were familiar with the local situation, implying that their visit was ostensibly for sightseeing but secretly for political purposes. Later, the Japanese men got drunk in a restaurant outside the East Gate and were escorted to the Nanyang Hotel by police officers. At 10:00 a.m. the next morning, Inspector Yao Lianqun of the Public Security Bureau led police officers to the hotel and politely persuaded them to return to Shanghai. After arriving at the train station, the older one pretended to be drunk and punched someone, refusing to board the train. He then fled into the wilderness, almost causing trouble. The police immediately chased him back and sent them both onto the train. They were still acting crazy on the train, causing alarm to the other passengers.</p>

<p>A few days ago, several customers, including Li Ganlin, came to Jiang Senmao's restaurant in Xiamenwai, Taicang. Because the heated wine was not exchanged to their satisfaction, they had an argument with the restaurant staff, Shi Shaoqing. Fortunately, they were persuaded to stop. However, Li Ganlin was still unwilling to let it go and gathered dozens of people from the city to meet with Shi and others at the teahouse opened by Zhang Shouzhen for a mediation meeting. Because they disagreed, they threw tables, chairs, and teapots. When the police arrived, Shi Shaoqing, Yang Axi, Ding Gangrong, and two others were seriously injured. The police immediately telegraphed the headquarters, and all the police officers rushed to the scene to suppress the situation. Only then did they stop. Li Ganyao, Gao Zihuo, and six others were arrested and brought to justice. The injured were taken to the county government for examination.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Three Drown in a Capsized Brick Boat in Suzhou <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Yang Mazi from Hangzhou, who worked for the Sancailong Shipping Company outside Changmen, hired Shen Peisheng's boat to transport a large batch of bricks and tiles from Suzhou to Hangzhou. While passing through Yangcheng Lake, a sudden wind caused the boat to capsize. Of the four people on board, Yang was rescued by a neighboring boat. The boat owner, Shen Peisheng, his younger brother, who was deaf, and an old woman who cooked on the boat all tragically drowned. Two days later, the old woman's body floated up and was first reported to the local court for examination and coffin preparation. The bodies of Shen Peisheng and his brother were recovered on the afternoon of the third day and transported to the court for examination. It was a tragic scene.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Bandits Kidnap a Small Steamer in Wuxi <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Licheng Steamer Bureau, located under the Gongyun Bridge in this county, had small steamers running between Wuxi and Cheng counties. Initially, business was very prosperous. In recent years, due to the convenience of land transportation, especially after the completion of the Wuxi-Cheng Highway, passengers traveling between Wuxi and Cheng counties mostly took cars. As a result, the bureau's business declined significantly. In order to develop its business, it established branches in Qingjiangpu, Suqian, and other places, and the business was very good. However, on December 12th of last year, the bureau's Flying Whale steamer, departing from Qingjiangpu, encountered bandits in Yangzhuang (about 18 li from Suqian). All the passengers on board were robbed, suffering heavy losses. Before leaving, the bandits also hijacked the steamer. Recently, the steamer was released by the bandits, but the accountant, Mr. Li, and the old helmsman, Zhou Quangen, have not yet returned to the bureau and their whereabouts are unknown. Mr. Li is from Jiangyin, and Zhou Quangen is 20 years old, from Jinchengwan, Yangming Township, Third District of this county. He comes from a poor family and has an elderly mother, a wife, and two brothers. The bureau has reported the kidnapping to the families of Zhou and Li. After hearing the news, Zhou's family was extremely anxious, with his wife weeping and his children crying, a truly pitiful sight. They have repeatedly sent people to Qingjiangpu and Suqian to inquire, but there is still no news. The other day, they went to Jiangyin to inquire about the truth from the Licheng branch and requested the bureau to ask the public security authorities to rescue the hostages so that the family could be reunited.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Labor-Capital Dispute in Oil Factories <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>This county, once known as a developed industrial and commercial area, is now not only superficially strong but actually weak, but also unworthy of the name. Although there are many reasons for this situation, they are all due to the economic aggression of imperialism. The local industry has been completely eliminated, and the silk industry has also failed, leading to the collapse of the rural economy and shaking the entire economic foundation. As a result, the purchasing power of farmers has weakened. During the planting season, they are unable to afford fertilizer, and the sales of soybean cakes produced by various oil factories have sharply declined. Only the large soybean cakes have some sales to other regions, while the rest are virtually ignored. Last year's operations all resulted in losses. Therefore, at the beginning of this year's operations, the wages of workers were reduced, but the workers did not agree, causing the factories to delay their reopening. Until yesterday, the Hengde and Runfeng factories, which use mechanical power to produce cakes, temporarily reopened, specializing in large soybean cakes. All wages remained the same, but the number of official work shifts was increased to maintain operations. As for the oil factories that use manual labor, such as Yimao and Sanhe, two factories temporarily reopened. The rest have not yet resolved the issue of increasing the number of shifts, so they cannot reopen in the coming days.</p>

<p>Liu Xihua, a farmhand in Tangyang Bridge Township, Eighth District of Wujin County, was beaten to death on the third day of the month. The director of the Seventh Public Security Sub-bureau, upon hearing the news, not only went to investigate but also sent police officer Xu Wenhua to the county prosecutor's office to request an autopsy. Chief Prosecutor Yang Kongxi, upon receiving the report, immediately summoned Xu Wenhua for questioning and approved him to supervise the autopsy by car on the morning of the fourth. He would then proceed with the investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Jiangyin County Government Reduces Local Surcharges <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>In accordance with the telegram from the Department of Finance, the county government convened a meeting of heads of various groups and organizations on the afternoon of the second to discuss the reduction of local surcharges. Secretary Bao, representing the county magistrate, chaired the meeting and decided on the following: (1) There are slight discrepancies between the current land prices and the previously set prices, and they should be changed immediately. The previously set price of 110 yuan per mu for superior paddy fields in the canal region should be reduced to 104 yuan, and the previously set price of 44 yuan per mu for newly cultivated fields in the sandy region should be reduced to 40 yuan. (2) The county's regular and surcharges exceed the 101% limit of land prices by 76,092 yuan.

<p>Wanxiang Slightly Damaged, Zhaoxing Sinks</p>
<p>Passengers and Crew Members Safe</p>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Wanxiang and the Zhaoxing Company's Zhaoxing collided in the Huangpu River near the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou around 1:00 p.m. yesterday. The Zhaoxing sank to the bottom of the river in less than half an hour, while the bow of the Wanxiang suffered minor damage. This is the latest unfortunate incident in the shipping industry. Upon hearing the news, our reporter rushed to the scene to investigate and reports the details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e105">Wanxiang Returns to Shanghai After Duty <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Wanxiang had been chartered to transport soldiers of the 19th Route Army from Fujian and Xiamen to Beijing for pre-training. After disembarking the soldiers in Beijing, the ship returned to Shanghai. Yesterday, around 11:00 a.m., it entered the Wusongkou and at 12:50 p.m., while passing near the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou, it encountered</p>

<p>The Zhaoxing, belonging to Zhaoxing Company, loaded a large batch of flour and miscellaneous grains at the Longmao Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong, and departed for Yantai and Longkou. It set sail from Shanghai at 11:30 a.m. yesterday. At 12:50 p.m., while sailing near the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou, it saw the Wanxiang coming head-on. At that time, it was high tide, and neither ship could avoid the other, resulting in</p>
<h3 id="e107">A Tragic Collision <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Zhaoxing attempted to turn its bow towards the west bank to avoid the collision, but due to the ship's speed and the rapid current, it could not retreat in time. The Zhaoxing's starboard bow compartment below the waterline was hit, creating a hole. River water immediately flooded in. Upon realizing the disaster, the ship's owner immediately sounded the alarm for help. Fortunately, it was daytime, making rescue easier. The Wanxiang's bow also suffered minor damage, but it was not serious. Therefore, it helped with the rescue. In less than an hour, the Zhaoxing sank completely. Only the mast is now visible above the water. Fortunately, apart from the cargo in the cabins, which sank with the ship, all of the</p>

<p>The Zhaoxing was carrying 14 passengers and a crew of about 50 to Yantai and Longkou. They were all rescued by the water police, the Wanxiang crew, and nearby ships and safely landed ashore. However, all their luggage and belongings were lost.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Estimated Losses of the Zhaoxing <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Zhaoxing has a deadweight of 1,200 tons. It was carrying 40,000 bags of flour and over 1,000 pieces of miscellaneous goods, with an estimated loss of about 200,000 yuan. It had been insured with the Zhaotai Insurance Company, but the amount insured is unknown because yesterday was a Sunday, and the company was closed.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Wanxiang to be Repaired the Same Day <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>After the collision between the Wanxiang and the Zhaoxing, the bow of the Wanxiang suffered minor damage. The company helped with the rescue work while sending someone to report to the company. Upon receiving the report, the company immediately ordered its factory workers to repair the Wanxiang. The repairs were completed by 5:00 p.m. that afternoon, and the ship was moved to the Hongsheng Wharf at 6:00 p.m. As for the issue of responsibility for the collision, neither party expressed an opinion yesterday because it was a Sunday. Negotiations will have to be conducted today.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Customs Hangs Warning Signals <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The customs authorities, fearing that passing ships might mistakenly sail towards the sunken ship and collide with its upper part, dispatched small boats to anchor around the area during the day, flying green flags, and at night, they lit red lights to warn other ships to avoid the area and prevent danger.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Message from the Pilots' Association <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The General Association of Chinese Merchant Marine Pilots states that the Zhaoxing, belonging to the Zhaoxing Shipping Company on Guangdong Road in this port, had just completed its annual repairs at a Japanese shipyard in Dalian. It was delivered to Shanghai by the Japanese side on the 3rd of this month. It had not yet been inspected by the Shanghai Maritime Administration to determine if the repairs were legal. Due to the urgency to sail, it was loaded overnight with over 1,000 tons of flour and miscellaneous goods and departed from Longmao Wharf at 12:05 p.m. yesterday, heading for Yantai, Longkou, and Tianjin. When it reached the Lujiazui area, it encountered the Wanxiang, belonging to the Sanbei Company, coming from Wusong. At the time, a sugar barge was obstructing the route. The Zhaoxing, in an attempt to avoid it, slowed down and signaled the Wanxiang first. However, the Wanxiang was traveling at high speed and was close to the shore, causing the Wanxiang's bow to collide with the Zhaoxing's forward compartment. The ship, which was smaller and older, was unable to withstand the impact. After about four or five minutes, it was carried by the tide and sank in front of the Jardine Matheson Wharf. Fortunately, the accident occurred during the day, and no one was injured.</p>

Amidst the rumbling sound of the engine, she shook hands with the farewell party. At 8:25 a.m., with a final "goodbye," she turned the plane's nose, took off, and headed straight for Seoul. The farewell party only left after the plane disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>Lin Wo to Go to Hangzhou to Coordinate Preparations for Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>Aviation Association Flying Club Established at the Same Time</p>
<p>The Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory is exclusively funding the purchase of a Junkers fighter plane to donate to the government. After the trial flight and acceptance a few days ago, the date of the naming ceremony of the plane was set after Lin Wo, the secretary-general of the Chinese Aviation Association, went to Hangzhou to discuss with Xu Peigen, the director of the Aviation Department. It will be held at the Hongqiao Airport on the 18th of this month. Director Xu Peigen will personally come to Shanghai to accept the plane. According to sources from the local Aviation Association, Lin returned to Shanghai last night to make preparations. The Flying Club, which was organized by the Aviation Association to train aviation talent, was also established at the same time. The young aviator Sun Tonggang will serve as the coach. Du Yuesheng previously donated a plane to Sun, but it is not suitable for long-distance flights. Sun has decided to donate it to the club. Because the delivery of the Tianchu fighter plane has been delayed, the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory will also donate the training plane obtained from the interest income to the Flying Club. After the club is established, it will recruit members to learn flight techniques, which will take four to six months to complete.</p>

<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that the China National Aviation Corporation, due to the thriving business between Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, and Chengdu, and the extremely developed passenger and postal services, plans to use the latest type of aircraft for flights this summer in order to shorten travel time and facilitate passengers and mail. The company is currently planning to purchase the aircraft. The new aircraft has a single-flight speed of 150 miles per hour, equivalent to about 450 li, which is one-third faster than the aircraft currently in use. In the future, it will be possible to take off from Shanghai in the early morning, arrive in Hankou at noon, and reach Chengdu in the afternoon. At that time, the journey between Shanghai and Chengdu will only take two days, with only ten hours in the air. The postal service will become even more convenient.</p>

<p>Denouncing the Pseudo-Manchu Usurper</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union sent a telegram stating: To be forwarded to all compatriots nationwide by all newspaper offices nationwide: Since the Japanese invaders occupied our Northeast, though more than two years have passed, our government has led the people with a firm determination to resist. Our Northeastern heroes and righteous armies, upholding the spirit of perseverance, have fought bloody battles and sacrificed countless lives in the lands of Changbai Mountain and the Heilong River. This is sufficient to show the shared hatred of the enemy and the high morale of the people, preferring shattering like jade to remaining whole like a tile. Yet, Pu Yi, with a deranged mind, recognizes the thief as his father, and under the protection of the Japanese invaders, has established a puppet state. Recently, he has intensified his actions, usurping the title of emperor, willingly serving as a puppet, the most shameless of all. We urge the central government to expose these facts, declare them to the world, and deny recognition. We also hope that all compatriots nationwide will rise up together, assist the central government, and severely punish the traitor, quickly recovering the lost territories to wash away this great humiliation. Seamen nationwide are eager to act, vowing to be the rearguard. The telegram fails to fully express our indignation. Respectfully, the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, Branch.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Ministry of Finance Rejects Additional Cotton Yarn Tax Collection in Chongming <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Referred to Jiangsu Provincial Government for Handling</p>
<p>Chongming County is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, and its terrain is strategically important. Due to continuous erosion by the river, part of the county has already collapsed. Out of a sense of protecting their homeland, the citizens of the county intend to levy an additional tax on cotton yarn, using the proceeds to prevent further erosion. They had previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for review. However, the Ministry of Finance, considering that the additional tax on cotton yarn would affect the entire tax system, rejected the request and referred it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for consideration. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Ministry of Finance Rejects Additional Tax Collection <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a response stating: Received the submission. After the implementation of the unified tax on cotton yarn, all taxes and levies should be exempted. The county's continued collection of erosion prevention donations on cotton yarn that has already paid the unified tax clearly contradicts the regulations on the unified tax on cotton yarn and should be stopped in accordance with the rules. It cannot be compared with taxes on land, small rents, or port fees. Erosion prevention projects are local affairs and should be funded by the provincial government through other means. The ministry has received submissions from citizens of the county, including Chen Jiagu and Yufeng Yarn Mill, and has referred them to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for investigation and handling. Regarding the current situation, in addition to referring it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for joint handling, you are hereby notified.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating: The Ministry has received a petition from Huang Xianlin, standing director of the Chongming Farmers' Association, Li Wenwei, standing director of the Education Association, Ling Lianfa, standing director of the Textile Industry Workers' Union, and Fan Rulin, standing director of the Fishermen's Association, requesting the imposition of an additional tax on cotton yarn to fund erosion prevention. After the implementation of the unified tax on cotton yarn, Yufeng Yarn Mill has repeatedly submitted petitions to the ministry, and the ministry has referred them to your provincial government for investigation and handling. Regarding the current situation, in addition to issuing a response, the ministry hereby consults you for reference and joint handling. Please respond.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Domestic Manufacturers Schedule Shanghai North National Products Exhibition <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association believes that the dumping of foreign goods is increasing day by day. According to customs reports, the trade deficit in January of this year reached a staggering amount of over 40 million yuan, which is alarming. If we do not actively promote domestic goods and increase production, the national economy will be in a state of bankruptcy. In view of this, the association has joined forces with Shanghai North gentry and businessmen Wang Binyan, Li Zhuxuan, Cai Qiajun, She Xipin, Yuan Hongjun, Li Guangjin, etc., to hold a Zhabei National Products Exhibition to encourage the people of Zhabei to jointly promote domestic products. The association has already surveyed the Datong Road in Zhabei and designated the Zhabei Charity Group as the venue. Preparations are currently underway, and the opening is scheduled for March 15. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e130">Committee Meeting <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The association specially convened a committee meeting yesterday for this matter. Those present included Liu Zhongying, Chen Binghui, Jin Weixuan, Cai Qiajun, and more than twenty others. Liu Zhongying presided over the meeting, Zhou Zhaolin took the minutes, and the meeting proceeded as scheduled. The items discussed included: (1) Please confirm the name of the Zhabei National Products Exhibition. The meeting decided to name it the Shanghai North National Products Exhibition. (2) Please confirm the opening date. The meeting decided to open on March 15. (3) Please nominate the preparatory committee. The meeting decided to nominate Xu Yunhui, Chen Binghui, Wang Binyan, Liu Zhongying, Gu Zhuxuan, Cai Qiajun, Gu Wensheng, Yuan Hongjun, Cao Zhigong, She Xipin, Hu Xiyuan, Ren Shigang, Xi Guansheng, Sun Xinzhu, Jin Weiyi, Zhang Shengai, Lin Guyun, Tao Zigun, Li Guangjin, Zhang Lixing, Cai Mingzheng, and others as preparatory committee members.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Filing for Record <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The association specially filed a request with the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau for record, stating that the application is for holding the Shanghai North National Products Exhibition, requesting approval and registration for the benefit of the proceedings. Foreign goods are being dumped more and more every day, and the outflow of money is uncountable. If this continues, not only will domestic goods factories be in danger of collectively shutting down, but the national economy will also be on the verge of collapse. The root cause is that the Chinese people are chasing after foreign goods and despising domestic goods. If this inferiority complex of valuing foreign goods and despising Chinese goods is not eradicated, then domestic goods will never be able to flourish. Based on this purpose, the association is committed to promoting domestic goods, and the National Products Exhibition is the most important and practical way to promote them. At the request of the majority of members and factories, the association plans to hold the Shanghai North National Products Exhibition to give the people of Shanghai North an opportunity to recognize domestic goods, so as to arouse their awareness of using domestic goods. The Zhabei Charity Group on Datong Road in Zhabei has been designated as the venue, and a temporary business site will be attached to the venue for the public to purchase goods. In addition to submitting an application to the Social Affairs Bureau for registration, the association hereby submits a written request to your department for review and approval, so as to facilitate the proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Notice to All Factories <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Notice: It has been decided by the committee meeting to hold the Shanghai North National Products Exhibition.

<p>Wu Tiecheng Presided, Ye Chucang Represented the Central Government to Offer Sacrifices</p>
<p>The death of Chen Qubing, a prominent historian of the Southern Society and member of the Party History Compilation Committee, was commemorated by important figures from the Party and State, as well as his former colleagues and friends, at a memorial service held at the Ningbo Fellow Provincial Association at 3 PM yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Order of the Assembly: (1) Sing a memorial song, (2) Representative of the Central Party Department offers sacrifices, (3) Representative of the Judicial Yuan offers sacrifices, (4) Representative of the Southern Society offers sacrifices, (5) Representative of the Autumn Society offers sacrifices, (6) Representative of the Jingxiong Girls' School offers sacrifices, (7) Representative of the Wujiang Shanghai Fellow Provincial Association offers sacrifices, (8) Students offer sacrifices, (9) All attendees of the memorial service offer sacrifices, (10) Chairman of the preparatory committee delivers a eulogy, (11) Report on the life of Mr. Qubing, (12) Speeches, (13) Family members offer thanks, (14) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Attendees included Ye Chucang, representing the Central Party Department, Tan Zhen, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, Cai Yuanpei and Wu Zhihui, members of the Central Committee, Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan (represented by Liu Xialing), Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai, as well as Pan Gongzhan, Li Dachao, Liu Yazi, Hu Puan, Yao Yuping, and representatives from the Southern Society, Autumn Society, Wujiang Shanghai Fellow Provincial Association, Jingxiong Girls' School, etc., totaling more than 600 people. The service was presided over by Wu Tiecheng.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address: Chairman Wu Tiecheng gave an address, saying, "Members of the Southern Society initiated the memorial service for Mr. Chen Peiren and entrusted Tiecheng and others to be responsible for the preparations. Today, not only old friends from this city have taken time out of their busy schedules to attend, but many have also traveled from afar to be here, which shows the deep respect of people in society for Mr. Chen. Looking back, after the success of the 1911 Revolution, much of the credit goes to the power of written propaganda, and Mr. Peiren was one of the most diligent people at that time in using writing to promote the revolutionary movement. Although Mr. Chen was a scholar, he used writing as a tool for revolution, but he also took practical action on many occasions. His articles, morals, personality, and career are not only admired by the members of the Southern Society but will also be forever engraved in the hearts of people across the country. Many of you present here today are old friends from the Southern Society and are very familiar with the history of Mr. Peiren. I will only say a few words based on my personal feelings. Mr. Chen was one of the most powerful participants in the revolution. He worked hard during the initial rise of the revolutionary forces, and he never slackened even after the revolution was completed. This is one point that makes us admire him. He was extremely devoted to his friends, and if someone entrusted him with something, he would do his best to accomplish it. As for his family, this is the second point that we admire him for. At this time, I feel even more that the old comrades in the Party are gradually aging and gradually passing away, and the national affairs are also getting worse day by day. Therefore, we old friends are extremely saddened by Mr. Chen's death, and thinking of the efforts of the old comrades in the past, we feel even more saddened by the current state of national affairs."</p>
<p>Ye's Report: Ye Chucang, representing the Central Government, then reported, "All of you present here today are either old friends of Mr. Chen or his students, so you know a lot about Mr. Chen's death, and the history of Mr. Chen's revolution is even more known to everyone at home and abroad, so there is no need to repeat it. What I want to say is that we all know that Chen was a revolutionary scholar, but we do not know that Mr. Chen also repeatedly participated in the actual work of the military. When I was eleven or twelve years old, it was after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. At that time, people in the country all wanted to avenge the shame of the Sino-Japanese War. However, Mr. Chen believed that if we wanted to avenge the shame of the Sino-Japanese War, we must first avenge the shame suffered by our nation more than 260 years ago. Therefore, he immediately recruited comrades and organized the Xuechi Society, which was actually a revolutionary organization. Mr. Chen also tried his best to bring a powerful army led by Fei into the society, which aroused suspicion from the outside world and eventually failed. From this, we can see that Mr. Chen not only made written propaganda but also made far-reaching military preparations. Another time, I spent New Year's Eve in Zhouzhuang (a rural area in Suzhou), and Mr. Chen came in a hurry and left in a hurry before dawn. Later, I learned that Mr. Chen took advantage of the opportunity to seal the customs and secretly transported military supplies to a secret military organization in the countryside. The above two things were actual work of the national revolution, which was ten years before the founding of the Republic of China, when the Southern Society had not yet been established and I was still studying in a rural school. This small amount of information is of irreplaceable value. In addition, Mr. Chen often liked to talk about national affairs with his friends, often until all night. He would also earnestly teach and guide the younger generation who asked for advice and never got tired. I have been working in propaganda for a long time and know that the deepest influence on people must be a gentle and generous heart. Mr. Chen was a person who possessed this character. From this, we must recognize that Mr. Chen was a scholar who was also capable in the military, an old predecessor who liked to encourage the younger generation the most."</p>
<p>Speeches by Wu and Cai: Then, Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, and others gave speeches in succession. Wu said, "Mr. Cai Jiemin and Mr. Chen Peiren and I are all old friends, so I know them very well. Most people in the world today think that Chen is a scholar, but I don't think so. Mr. Chen did not use writing as a tool for entertainment but to exert his ability to lead the masses. It is not only in the propaganda of writing, but also in actual work. We should not regard the success of Yao, Shun, Wen, and Wu as not being scholars, and the failure of Confucius, Mencius, Lao Zhuang, Mo, and Xun as being only scholars." Cai said, "I want to contribute two points of view at today's memorial service. First, the function of writing has a great and lasting influence, and establishing a name can especially pass on people to immortality. Mr. Chen used his whole life to promote the function of writing, so we must collect his posthumous works today to commemorate Mr. Chen. Second, the life of a person is limited, but the life of a group is infinite. Although Mr. Chen did not enjoy a very long life, he passed away suddenly, but his spirit can be entrusted to the group to pass on to infinity, such as the Jingxiong Girls' School and the Southern Society founded by Mr. Chen. Therefore, I hope that the members of the Southern Society will be able to work hard to extend the Southern Society to infinity, because extending the life of the Southern Society is also extending the life of Mr. Chen." The rest of the speech was omitted.</p>

<p>Memorial Text of the Assembly: On March 4th, the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, all members of the memorial service respectfully offer clear wine and a variety of delicacies to the spirit of Mr. Chen Qubing, saying, "The ten thousand acres of Lake Taihu are truly blessed with spiritual beauty. The Pine and Pottery River and Marsh gave birth to our honorable gentleman. The family has a tradition of chivalry, with lofty aspirations like Zhu and Guo. The two Chens are distinguished, with high vision and foresight. Our honorable gentleman was orphaned early and depended on his mother. With the appearance of a dragon and the demeanor of a phoenix, he was a scholar but not pedantic. There was an elder scholar in Wu, named Xu Xianglu. He taught in the River and Fen area, a teacher of scriptures and a teacher of people. The door displayed high rankings, with two willows twice. Our honorable gentleman came out late, daring to follow Jin. In the year of Jiawu, the new flame was extinguished. In the year of Wuxu, there was reform. Kuaiji was ashamed, and lectures gathered the group. In the year of Guimao, he went east to Japan. To resist the Russian army, he raised a knife and slapped the tent. Where the wind and clouds went, to resist the barbarians and reject the Manchus, with bare hands, he swore to raise the Han banner. He struck the alarm bell and built the stage. The surviving people recorded it, and secret history suffered disaster. The literary network was highly visible, and he walked around Anhui and Zhejiang. After Xu Xilin was martyred, he followed in Nanyue. He mourned the ancients at Yai Mountain, with tears filling his eyes. He returned across the sea, and ulcers grew on his left elbow. The illness was finally cured, and he lived in seclusion in Gaoqiao. He then founded the Southern Society, and the national soul could be summoned. The three gentlemen stood as tripods, namely Gao and Liu. He recorded thousands of people, and his writings were eternal. The Xinhai Restoration was splendid and bright. He raised the great Han banner and lived in Canglang. He floated on the Xiang River and waded through the foothills. He traveled to Wanping. Shi Heng entered Luoyang, and ten thousand streams of hearts poured in. He had great thoughts and distant visions, crossing over Juyong. He planned the border and settled the far away, watching the sky dreamily. He protected the law in Guangdong and assisted Sun Zhongshan in planning in the tent, listening to his words and following his advice. He swore an oath in Shaozhou, with the Yellow Dragon wine full. Who would have thought that Chen Jiongming would eventually betray the Han? He returned to his lofty aspirations, putting down his arms and focusing on literature. He lectured at Tai Xue, on the bank of the Yangtze River. But heaven did not have pity, and the beams broke and the rafters collapsed. He escorted the coffin south and returned, with the soul of a loyal subject broken. He chose a tomb in Zijin, truly building it himself. The master craftsman transported the axe and consulted and measured. It was the year of Yangjiu, and Luoyang and Sichuan were in turmoil. He矫尾厉角, 左袒環龍. After the southeast was settled, Wu and Chu merged. A cry at Zhaoling, and grudges and grievances were all wiped out. The strong have already been rewarded, and the Peng map is temporarily suppressed. He典藏新京, 修史焦麓. Time does not stay, and the green jade and blue Yao are quite close to the beginning of smelting. One autumn night, the moon violated Shaowei. The jade coffin suddenly descended, and the women cried and the children wailed. Tracing back to the birth of the honorable gentleman, the rivers and mountains are like the sun and stars. Grieving the death of the honorable gentleman, the lingering shadow of the snake. On the Bin of Wusong, thinking of the honorable gentleman's old travels, the old friends are in the hundreds, and the high society is celebrating with drinking. Green pines and cypresses, setting the public spirit well, yellow bananas and red lychees, beckoning the public soul. There is meat in the sacrifice, and there is wine in the bottle. May you come down here, and bless and enjoy." Then, Liu Yazi, the representative of the Southern Society, respectfully offered a piece of incense and a thousand lines of hot tears to the spirit of the Choonam Mengchang, saying, "Alas, at the end of the Qing Dynasty, the sky was stinky and the sky was fishy. I raised the Southern Society to resist the Northern Court. We, the Chaonan Society, were the first to set up a big flag. There was also Tian Mei, with the left horn and the right corner. The thief was incompetent, but he was still in a tripod. He looked at the sky with white eyes, with tears filling his eyes. For thirty years, the sea has turned into a mulberry field. Tian Mei died early, and the public later passed away. Facing the flute and the yellow furnace, a cry in the west wind. Old friends have fallen, auspicious unicorns and mighty phoenixes. Zhongyuan Gaozhuan, Shenzhou is sinking. The little clown Pu Yi still occupies the false court. The Japanese barbarians are in turmoil, what a world. I am in a state of grief and wear my hair down. The whole land is full of cries. I call myself with my name on my way. The deer are running after wood on the land. What do I want in the forest? I mourn my fellow traveller and I'm sorry for the soul! The way has always been so with me! I am sorrowful for my predecessor, so i envy you because you have finished your ways of life! Arson with fierce fire, whom shall I blame. As I grieve for the dead, and about to think of myself, tears flowing and uttering my words, will the public spirit be ignorant. May you enjoy it." In addition, there were also memorial texts from the fellow provincial association, etc. (omitted). After the representatives finished their speeches, Chen Mianxiang, a family member, gave a thank-you speech. The meeting adjourned at five o'clock.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank Establishes Agricultural Marketing Office in Shanghai <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Office Located in Nanshi, Operations Commenced</p>
<p>In recent years, the rural economy has fallen into bankruptcy, attracting widespread attention. The root cause is, of course, the low price of agricultural products and the inconvenience for farmers in direct marketing to urban markets. Therefore, merely injecting financial resources without focusing on the marketing of farmers' products cannot fundamentally resolve their livelihood issues. Recognizing this, the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank has established the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Agricultural Marketing Office in Shanghai. This aims to provide continuous support to farmers from the seedling stage to the sale of harvested grains. It is reported that the office's objective is to exclusively act as an agent for the marketing of products produced by various cooperative societies and farmers throughout the province. The preparatory office has already commenced operations, located at No. 3, Peide Lane, Lima Road, Nanshi. The director is temporarily concurrently held by Mr. Hou Houpei, deputy manager of the Farmers' Bank head office, and the deputy director is Mr. Hu Duming. The office's regulations for agency marketing and purchasing are excerpted below: (1) According to Article 2, Section 2 of the organizational charter, the office may act as an agent for cooperative societies or farmers to purchase fertilizers, seeds, and other essential production materials. (2) When entrusting the office to make purchases, prior consultation and a detailed written commission, in a format prescribed by the office, are required. (3) When entrusting the office to handle goods, the trademarks, types, prices, and other details must be clearly specified in the written commission. Otherwise, the commissioning party will bear responsibility for any errors, returns, exchanges, or other losses. (4) When entrusting the office to purchase goods, the office may charge a handling fee proportionate to the value of the goods, but not exceeding 10 per mille. In special circumstances, the fee may be calculated based on the volume. (5) When entrusting the office to handle goods, the principle is to prepay a corresponding amount (interest-free), with any surplus refunded and any shortfall to be made up. When necessary, the office may introduce the commissioning party to the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank to borrow funds against the entire value of the goods. (6) If the market price is unsuitable, the prepaid payment will be fully refunded, and the handling fee may be partially or fully returned. (7) All shipping costs, taxes, and other expenses incurred in entrusting the office to purchase goods shall be borne by the commissioning party. If necessary, the office may advance payments, and the interest will be calculated daily according to the Shanghai interbank rate. Upon receiving notification from the office, the commissioning party shall immediately prepare funds for repayment and must not delay. All advanced payments and interest shall be calculated in Shanghai silver dollars. (8) Upon receiving the delivery notice from the office, the commissioning party shall immediately pay all outstanding amounts and present the receipt to collect the goods. If the goods are not collected after the deadline, the office may sell them. (9) When necessary, the commissioning party shall insure the goods. The office can act as an agent for insurance, and the insurance premium shall be borne by the commissioning party. (10) The office is not responsible for any accidents if the goods are not insured by the commissioning party or cannot be insured, or if they have been declared but not yet insured. (11) The price of all goods purchased on behalf of the commissioning party shall be based on the invoice. (12) If goods cannot be shipped immediately after purchase, the office may store them in a warehouse without seeking the commissioning party's consent, and the warehousing fees shall be borne by the commissioning party. (13) After the goods have been shipped, postal delivery will be based on the postal receipt, and shipping by sea will be based on the bill of lading. The office is not responsible for any incidents that occur en route but may jointly investigate with the commissioning party. (14) These measures may be amended at any time if there are any omissions. (15) These measures will be implemented after being approved and promulgated by the head office of the Farmers' Bank.</p>

<p>Decorating the Lantern Festival with Paper Lanterns Leads to Catastrophe</p>
<p>Unable to Wake Them in the Emergency, Resulting in Being Burned to Death</p>
<p>At approximately 2:00 AM yesterday morning, the Chen Yuji Shoe Store at No. 66, Yangjiadu Heng Street, Lima Road, outside the Dadongmen in Nanshi, suddenly caught fire. A tenant mother and son were burned to death on the spot, and five houses were destroyed. Details are recorded below.</p>

<p>The Chen Yuji Shoe Store was opened by Chen Shuxing from Jiangdu and has a history of several years. The business is considered relatively prosperous. Chen's wife, Guan, is 23 years old and has a one-year-old son named Hongzi. The whole family lives in the front building of the house. The back building is rented to his younger brother, Shumo. The pavilion is rented to a Mr. Gao, and a three-story loft is rented to Pu Changfa, a fellow villager who is a dockworker.</p>

<p>Chen's younger brother, Shumo, is 23 years old. He married a Miss Wang last summer. Recently, as the Lantern Festival of the old lunar calendar approached, city residents are accustomed to hanging paper lanterns indoors as decoration. Chen was no exception. Chen lit the lantern and hung it by the bed the night before. However, at approximately 2:00 AM yesterday morning, the red candle burned out, burning the entire paper lantern. In an instant, the curtains were all ignited, immediately starting a raging fire. Chen and his wife were awakened in shock, but it was already irreparable and impossible to save.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Catastrophe Occurred <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>In an instant, the flames had already spread to the upstairs, breaking through the roof. The fire brigades from various districts drove pump trucks to the scene to connect water for extinguishing. In addition to the complete destruction of the store's building, its neighbors, No. 64 Gu Shunxing Bamboo Mat Store, No. 62 Zhang Tongxing Hemp Bag Store, and the building of a certain Mr. at No. 60, as well as one façade of No. 58 Yuanxing Cigarette Paper Store, were also affected and almost completely destroyed. The total losses are significant.</p>

<p>It is believed that when the fire was raging, Pu Changfa (55 years old), a dockworker from Yangzhou living in the store's three-story loft, his wife, Wu (59 years old), and his son, Dengbao (37 years old), were sound asleep because they worked hard during the day. Therefore, they did not notice the fire downstairs at all. Subsequently, the flames spread to the loft, igniting the cotton quilts that Pu and others were covering. Pu Changfa woke up from his dream, but saw that the room was full of flames and was very panicked. He immediately called out to his wife and son to get up quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Fire Starter Arrested <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>It turned out that after calling out several times, they still did not wake up. At that time, Pu's shoulder had been burned by the flames and was unbearably painful. Therefore, he did not have time to put on clothes and jumped down from the loft naked to escape to the outside of the door, which allowed him to escape the danger. However, his elderly wife and beloved son could not be saved. He could only witness the two of them being buried in the fire. At that time, Chen Guan, the starter of the fire, had been arrested by a policeman from the first district and taken to the first district along with Pu Changfa. After first giving Pu clothes to wear, he was immediately sent to the hospital by car. The district chief, Guan Gong, interrogated Ms. Chen once and then ordered her to prepare a document and send it to the bureau for further interrogation. He also sent people to the fire scene to dig out the bodies of Pu's wife, Wu, and his son, Dengbao. However, both corpses were burned beyond recognition, with broken heads and rotten faces, and intestines flowing out, which was extremely tragic. Yesterday morning, District Chief Guan ordered the local Jia to report to the Shanghai Local Court and requested that personnel be sent to conduct an autopsy today.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Private Opium Den Established Inside Asia Hotel <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Exquisite Smoking Tools Used by Upper-Class People</p>
<p>Proprietor Sentenced to Eight Months and Fined Two Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>The Asia Hotel, located at No. 135 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, was previously found by the French police to be harboring gambling, and the Vice Captain Xie Guangming, Hang Bingquan, and detectives Cai Zongyi of the gambling arrest team were dispatched to search it. Twenty-seven gamblers, including the head of the gambling house Wu Changyou, Yi Chaorong, and the gamblers Cao Yuchang, were arrested in Room 327 on the third floor. Gambling tools and gambling funds were seized and taken to the police station, along with the hotel manager Shen Shouping, and sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. The gambling heads and gamblers were sentenced to imprisonment and fines, and the manager Shen Shouping was fined thirty yuan for illegally allowing gambling, as reported previously. Unexpectedly, in addition to hotels allowing gambling, they also allow people to privately set up opium dens inside, providing people with lamps to smoke opium. The mechanisms are tight, and it is not easy for outsiders to know. On the evening of the second, the detectives of the French police gambling arrest team learned that someone was gambling in the hotel and rushed to search it at 0.15 points. The gamblers had already escaped when they heard the news. The detectives searched the rooms one by one and found the smell of opium emanating from the front of Room 518 on the fifth floor. It was discovered that there was an opium den inside. After knocking on the door for a long time without opening, only the sound of footsteps was heard in the room. When the waiter was called to get the key to open the door and enter, the opium lamp was brightly lit on the bed, and the furnishings were extremely luxurious. The opium smokers had already escaped from the window or the mechanical door in the toilet behind the bed. Only Hua Daxin, a native of Yong (28 years old, formerly a compradore on a certain steamer of Taikoo Company), who privately set up the opium den, was arrested. Two smoking guns, four lamps, four pipes, fourteen taels of opium paste (including the jar), another box of thirty-one five-tael opium bubbles, a jar of ash, sold for fourteen yuan, one large and one small iron box, countless sundries, ten decks of dominoes, a box of Hua's business cards (printed with Asia Hotel, Room 510, Seafarers' Office), and two opium account books were seized. From the smoking tools seized, it was speculated that the addicts who went to smoke and eat were all upper-class people. Hua and the evidence were taken to the police station. After questioning, he admitted to privately setting up the opium den. When the detectives came to search, there were Wang and Zhu smoking inside. When they heard the knocking, they escaped, etc. The police chief ordered them to be detained. The next day, he was sent to the Criminal Court 1 of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case and presented the evidence to the court. Then, the bailiff Cai Zongyi reported the search process. When Hua Daxin was questioned, he confessed that the opium den was opened by Wang Yichang, who was at large. I went to find a friend to entrust a job in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and was detained. After Judge Zhang Zhaoyou examined the opium account book among the exhibits, he ordered the defendant to write numbers and compared them with the handwriting on the account, which matched. When the defendant was questioned again, he finally bowed his head and admitted to privately setting up the opium den. The court then sentenced Hua Daxin to eight months in prison and a fine of two hundred yuan. The fine was commuted to one day of imprisonment for every three yuan. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed was used to offset one day of imprisonment for every two days. The seized smoking tools and other items were confiscated, and the defendant was detained in the detention center pending instructions.</p>

However, Zhang is fond of women and lustful. Every time he is free from official duties, he wears gorgeous Western suits and frequents various amusement parks in this city, pursuing women and having fun. There was a Yangzhou woman named Dong Qiaoying, who is 17 years old and recently came to Shanghai from her hometown, residing with her uncle Li Youcai at No. 108 Danfeng Road inside the Xinbeimen. At approximately 9:00 PM the night before, after Li and others had dinner, because Qiaoying's visit to Shanghai was still the first time, he led her to visit the Fuan Amusement Park at Xiaodongmenkou. At that time, Zhang was also playing in the park. When he saw Qiaoying, although she was a villager.</p>

<p>Chen Atian, a local villager residing at No. 293 Rue Baye, working as a gardener, is 47 years old this year. His wife, Ms. Lu, is about the same age as Chen. Last month, she had a dispute with the neighboring landlord surnamed Wang over boundary stones. They argued with each other and then grappled and beat each other, causing Ms. Lu to suffer minor injuries. She reported the injury to the French police, and the police detained Mr. Wang and sent him to the Second Special District Local Court for prosecution. After the court hearing, the presiding judge ordered the bailiff to take the victim, Chen Lu, back to the court's forensic office to examine the injuries. At that time, her husband, Chen Atian, also accompanied her. After arriving at the forensic office, Chen Atian took out banknotes worth twenty yuan and gave them to the forensic doctor as a bribe, requesting the forensic doctor to help and report the injuries suffered by his wife as more serious, hoping that the defendant who caused the injury would be severely punished. Initially, the forensic doctor still thought that Chen was ignorant and refused to accept it and persuaded Chen with kind words, explaining the advantages and disadvantages. But Chen insisted on asking for help and stuffed the banknotes into the forensic doctor's coat pocket. At this point, the forensic doctor considered Chen to be unreasonable and detained Chen. At the same time, he sent the banknotes to the prosecutor's office and reported to the chief prosecutor, asking for an interrogation.</p>

<p>Court Verifies the Injury as True</p>
<p>Public Accusation Has Been Made in the Criminal Court</p>
<p>Zhao Changgen, the young owner of Zhao Tongxing Copper Workshop on Bendong Street, is 28 years old this year. He previously married Ms. Gu. Ms. Gu is 25 years old this year. Since getting married, it has been ten years, and the relationship between the husband and wife is flat. It is unexpected that Ms. Gu filed a complaint with the Local Court a few days ago, accusing her husband and parents-in-law of abuse and injury, requesting an examination. Her complaint stated that she married Zhao Changgen, the son of Zhao Bingsheng, at the age of sixteen and lived together in Zhao Tongxing Copper Workshop on Bendong Street. Her husband has no proper occupation and relies on his father to make a living. Recently, five years ago, her husband became acquainted with a little nun (named A San) in a certain temple in this city. Soon after, he brought her home and moved Ms. Gu's bedroom to the back building. The little nun occupied the main room instead, like a cuckoo occupying a magpie's nest. The little nun and her husband were like husband and wife, leaving Ms. Gu like　　　　. Ms. Gu thought that her fate was miserable and she had to endure it, hoping that her husband would change his mind in the future and that they would be reconciled. The little nun came to the house and lived together for three years. The little nun and her husband moved out together again two years ago, renting a house opposite Zheng School in Beizhangjia Lane on Sanpai Street. They were more affectionate than ever, walking and sitting together, inseparable. Her husband only returned home once or twice a month, or not for several months, and he was always in the　　, never staying overnight at home. However, Ms. Gu worked at home, no different from a slave, and her mother-in-law and sister-in-law ridiculed her all day long. Ms. Gu lived like years, as if she was living in the underworld hell in the Yangjian world. Ms. Gu suffered abuse from her husband and parents-in-law, which is difficult to describe in writing. This time, her clothes were cut to pieces by someone, and when her husband returned home, Ms. Gu immediately told him about it. Unexpectedly, her husband blamed Ms. Gu for not being careful and beat her violently, causing her injury. Her parents-in-law were on the sidelines and did not stop him, but instead helped their son commit the violence. In such a dark and unjust situation, she specially requested an examination, etc. After the prosecutor examined it and confirmed that Zhao Gu's injuries were true, he ordered her to go back for medical treatment and ordered Zhao Changgen and others to be summoned to court for questioning. Zhao did not come to court because he was afraid of being punished. It is heard that this case has been prosecuted in the criminal court by the prosecutor, requesting a public judgment.</p>

<p>Robbers Ransack and Plunder Before Fleeing in Wild Abandon</p>
<p>The Victim Follows Closely, Alerts Police Who Shoot and Hit the Mark</p>
<p>At approximately 7:40 PM last night, five robbers suddenly appeared at the residence of a Mr. [Surname] at No. 177 Connaught Road West, Shanghai. Four of the robbers were armed with handguns. They first guarded the front and back doors while the remaining robber(s) entered to commit the robbery. The victims were confined to a corner and forced to hand over the keys to the chests. Consequently, the robbers were able to search and plunder at will. After about an hour, they emerged with their loot, having stolen money, valuables, and clothing worth over 500 yuan. However, as the robbers left the house, the victim followed closely behind. Seeing that the robbers were about to escape, he shouted urgently for someone to catch the robbers. A nearby constable, hearing the call, quickly gave chase, ordering the robbers to stop. Ignoring the order, the robbers continued to flee wildly. The constable drew his gun and fired a single shot, hitting the last robber in a vital area.</p>

<p>The woman named Qiao Ying was elegant and beautiful. Zhang used his old tricks to pursue her, winking and making ugly gestures. Qiao Ying, seeing this, ignored him. Unexpectedly, Zhang went further, approaching her closely and surreptitiously pulling at her trousers. He then gestured with his mouth, implying that she should go with him to talk elsewhere. Qiao Ying, disgusted by this, went with her uncle, Li Youcai, to another venue to watch a show. Unexpectedly, Zhang followed them, continuing to pull at her trousers. The woman became furious and told her uncle what had happened, who rebuked Zhang. Zhang, ashamed and enraged, retorted with insults and curses. Onlookers, seeing this, were indignant, leading to a sudden commotion. The on-site police, hearing the disturbance, arrived and detained Zhang, taking him to the First Sub-District of the First Precinct. During the preliminary hearing by Director Liu, Zhang Ruquan continued to rant and rave, claiming he would call the mayor and demand that he come and severely punish them. The police then found a bottle of "External Application Quick Yang Medicine Dew" on Zhang. Because this person dared to harass a young woman and continued to rant and rave with such brazenness, it was ordered that a formal document be prepared yesterday morning and sent to the Municipal Police Bureau for strict investigation and punishment.</p>
<p>Following the investigation by Prosecutor Wang [Name], it was determined that Chen [Name] was indeed guilty of bribery. Chen was taken into custody, but after his family requested bail, he was allowed to be released pending further investigation. Recently, Judge Shan Zhang Zhao Zuo, together with Prosecutor Wang Ren [Name], held a trial in the First Court. The defendant couple and the lawyer hired by [them], Wang Shizong, appeared in court to await questioning. First, the defendant, Chen A'tian, was questioned regarding his age and origin. Then, the prosecutor stood and stated the grounds for the prosecution, asking Chen how he bribed the forensic doctor. Chen replied that he asked the doctor to examine the injuries. He said to the doctor to treat them. He says that he should send red envelopes to the doctors. He says he thought that it was cheaper to invite a doctor in the countryside than in Shanghai. Chen then sent twenty dollars. The court asked him if he knows that the court does not require any red envelopes for performing injury exams. Chen said that he knows in court other than the official fee for receipts, they do not take any money. Chen said that he is from the countryside and does not know about the court exam, and he just thought that he should be giving the red envelope to the doctor. Then, Chen's wife, Lu, was questioned. She says that after she was arrested, someone asked her for money. She said that she got injured and was sleeping at home. Her husband got arrested and she was crying at home. Then, Zhu Wenbao came to her and told her that he worked at Shen Yong's law firm. He told her that for 700 dollars, he can get her husband freed. But she says she did not have money. The court asks her how she knows that Zhu is from the law firm. She says that he told her. He said he lived in Caojiadu, but she does not know his address. After this question, the court says that there will not be debate that day. Instead, they will investigate and question at a later date. The defendant will still be on original bail.</p>
<p>The constable arrived on the scene and found the robber bleeding profusely, barely alive. The other robbers had already escaped. The constable quickly returned to the Gordon Road police station to report the incident and dispatched a vehicle to rush the injured robber to the hospital. However, due to the severity of the injuries, the robber died en route. The body was then sent to the coroner's office for examination. Meanwhile, detectives were dispatched to No. 177 to investigate, inquiring in detail about the clothing and appearance of the other robbers in order to apprehend them and bring them to justice.</p>

In addition, the bank's profit distribution over the years should also be submitted to the shareholders' meeting for approval. It was decided to schedule the third regular shareholders' meeting, in accordance with Article 19 of the bank's articles of association, to be held on April 5th at the Bank Association.

<h3 id="e162">The Ancient Bronze Ding Transported to Shanghai Has Been Sold <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>A Shanghai Collector Purchases It for a High Price</p>
<p>The ancient bronze ding transported to Shanghai from Shouzhou, Anhui Province, was confirmed by Shanghai archaeologists to be an antique from before the Three Dynasties. The Ministry of Education also sent a telegram to the Shanghai Education Bureau to investigate. It has been learned that the ding has been purchased by a Shanghai collector for a high price. According to the owner, the ding was buried deep in the ground, over sixty feet deep, surrounded by wooden boards on all sides. When it was unearthed, the wooden boards were already badly rotted. It took over six months and more than one hundred workers to excavate the ding. Therefore, the owner's expenses were considerable. When unearthed, there were many animal bones inside the ding. It is said that these bones were the so-called "animal charcoal" used for burning incense in ancient times. There are many antiques in the counties around Shouzhou, Anhui Province, but unfortunately, they have been scattered in various places. It has been learned that the owner has completed the sale and will soon be leaving Shanghai.</p>

The Panchen Lama personally drew a Tibetan version of the Guanyin Wàn Union as the initiator, handing it over to the Master and layman Liu. The Master also met with Shi Qingyang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and Huang Musong, a special envoy to Tibet, to discuss the religious and political situation in Tibet.

<h3 id="e167">Shen Enfu Reviews Introduction to Shuowen Books <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Six Books of Justice...Shuowen Key...Shuowen Key Sequel</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Junzhongyou immediately printed Shuowen Gulin and its sequel, the culmination of the government's study of Xu Xue, so that small scholars could originally examine each character and study the theories of various schools. Recently, he compiled and printed three kinds of "Six Books of Justice", "Shuowen Key" and "Shuowen Key Sequel", so that beginners can get the ladder to entry. Mr. Shen Xinqing recently read the three books, deeply admired Mr. Ding's diligence, and especially congratulated young people with national studies. The special features are as follows: ("Six Books of Justice") Among the six books, the two meanings of transformation and borrowing have the latest inventions. The example of borrowing in Xu's book is based on the theory of Gaomi, and it is correct to say that the wrong words written in Shuowen Xuchuan have a basis, and they are by no means created by imaginary ones. ("Shuowen Key") Using the circumference method, from shallow to deep, it attracts people, and the various articles of the official script change, and all those that do not conform to the original meaning of the word creation are collected and listed, which can save the scholar's examination of the eyes, ("Shuowen Key Sequel") collecting Shuowen's questions and answers, and the study and proofreading of the words in Shuowen's classics. Two types can help in the study of the classics. One type of ancient literature is that all common words that are not found in Shuowen can be seen at a glance. Its name is called Key, which can be said to be true to its name. In fact, all three are the keys to Shuowen. If scholars want to see the halls of Xu's book, they must first ask to enter the common gate, and if they want to enter the gate, they must first get the key.</p>

<p>Accused of Publishing a Satirical Cartoon</p>
<p>After the Ji Juemi was sued for raping Xu Yuying, Diamond News published a satirical drawing in the newspaper. The picture shows two doors, and a person is drawn making an entry. The word "law" is written on the door, and the word "Buddha" is written on the person's back. On both sides of the picture, the words "Yamen Hall opens and no money comes in", "No bystanders allowed" and "Backdoor entrance and exit" are written. It was discovered by the First Special District Court Procuratorate that the newspaper had published this cartoon, which was suspected of insulting the public office. The newspaper's editor, Zheng Yimei, was summoned to the case by Prosecutor Zhong Qing, and after the interrogation, it was deemed that a public prosecution should be filed. Zheng was ordered to pay a bail of 500 yuan, and the lawsuit was filed in the same-level criminal court in accordance with Article 146, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened a court hearing. Prosecutor Zhong stated the reasons for the prosecution in court, and the defendant Zheng Yimei also hired a lawyer to defend himself, saying that the illustrations published were satirizing the An Guan Temple and the old yamen. Finally, the prosecutor presented his arguments, and the judge then declared that the defendant was found guilty of publicly insulting the public office, and was fined 300 yuan, and two copper plates of the Diamond News and one copper plate were confiscated.

After Fan induced the girl to leave, he entrusted someone to marry the girl to Wang Lifu, who lived at No. 15 Zhiqing Lane, Shanghai West, as his wife, and obtained 100 yuan of gifts for use. Now that Xia Chuntai has learned of the previous situation, he secretly went to the address the day before yesterday, arrested Wang Lifu, Xia Xiaoyuan, and Fan Yilian, and called the police to detain them in the Sixth District. After the district officials interrogated them separately, they prepared a document to transfer them to the local court for interrogation.</p>

The examination will be held in Beijing on June 1st. (Registration procedures can be found in the recruitment regulations.) The quota is set at six people.

<p>Rongji Xin Quan Chi Bathhouse, located at the intersection of Route de Marche and Lafayette Road in the French Concession, was opened by a local named Xu Lantian, who has been in business for many years. Because Xu also operates a hydropower business, he has strong capital. Last summer, the bathhouse was renovated, and business has become more prosperous. Recently, it has been heard that unscrupulous people are impersonating the bathhouse, swindling money, and issuing receipts.

<p>Fire at Yu Ming Spreads to Five Stores</p>
<p>Zhu Jiachun Missing, Arson Suspected</p>
<p>Shen Zhenhua, the head of the First Branch of the Second District Public Security Bureau, upon receiving orders, immediately moved to crack down on foreign jade workshops and was in the process of ordering the owners of said workshops to sign pledges and install fire-fighting equipment within a set time limit. Unexpectedly, yesterday at 10:00 AM, a fire broke out at the Yu Ming Foreign Jade Store at 306 Fuyou Road. Due to the nature of the raw materials used in foreign jade, which are made of rosin, it can easily ignite if one is not careful, and it spreads extremely quickly. Police officer Cui Bingyan of the No. 2 post spotted it and immediately returned to the station to report it. Chief Shen, in addition to notifying the fire brigade, personally led Inspectors Qi and Hong, Police Chief Ma, and others to the scene to maintain order and assist in the rescue. However, the fire had already spread to five other businesses on the same road: the Yong Xing Foreign Jade Store at 304, the Ma Hong Xing Foreign Jade Store at 308, the Yong Xing Zhai Foreign Jade Store at 310, and the Hua Mei Glassware Store at 312, all of which were engulfed in flames. Fortunately, it was during the daytime, and no one was injured. The fire was extinguished after about an hour. Afterwards, Chief Shen, finding that the owner of Yu Ming, Zhu Jiachun, was out, had no choice but to detain Zhu Huian, the store's junior manager, for questioning. Zhu Huian confessed that he was from Danyang, 20 years old, and that the Yu Ming Foreign Jade Store was established by his father, Zhu Jiachun. This morning, his father had gone to a teahouse for a cup of tea and had not yet returned. He was upstairs when he heard the apprentices say that a mishap occurred when they accidentally spilled chemicals during work, causing the disaster. Chief Shen found Zhu Huian's statement vague and was unsure of the cause of the fire or whether there was insurance. As the store owner Zhu Jiachun could not be found, arson was suspected, and he was sent to the bureau for interrogation. Meanwhile, the police were ordered to investigate the true cause of the fire.</p>

<p>Runhua Kunji Hotel Offers Free Photos There are numerous hotels in Shanghai, but few are both economical and clean. The Runhua Kunji Hotel at 6045 Fuzhou Road, at the intersection of Zhejiang Road, has focused on cleanliness and economy since its reorganization. Over the past few months, the results have been remarkable. It is now heard that the hotel has made a special agreement with the Youde Photo Studio on Guizhou Road to offer a special deal to its customers. Any guest who pays a room fee of 5 yuan or more will receive a 20% discount on the room fee and a free 12-inch half-length artistic photograph, two 10-inch half-length photographs, or four 4-inch photographs from the Youde Photo Studio, with proportional increases for larger amounts, as a souvenir.</p>

<p>New Medical Techniques for Postpartum Complications Postpartum fever is notoriously difficult to treat. The Zhengdao Layman in Shanghai has promoted massage therapy, which has shown remarkable results in treating difficult cases. It is even more miraculous in treating postpartum conditions. Last autumn, in August, the wife of Director Huang Jintao of the Hankou Tax Collection Office had postpartum bleeding and abdominal pain two days after giving birth, accompanied by chills and fever. All doctors were ineffective. Later, she was admitted to the International Hospital in the city for treatment, which lasted for over eighty days. Her illness had weakened her, and she was in an increasingly dangerous state. A foreign doctor diagnosed that she would be in danger within three days. Fortunately, the layman rushed to Hankou and applied massage therapy, which resulted in her recovery. Generally speaking, this condition is mainly treated by draining the accumulated fluid. It is said that in Mrs. Huang's case, not only was the blood clot drained, but a large amount of mineral fluid was also discharged with the urine. The fluid was white, shiny, and hard, forming grains. It was different from the various white powders seen in ordinary urolithiasis or kidney deficiency, or other conditions of kidney weakness. Many obstetric experts have studied it and believe that they have never seen anything like it. It is truly a new medical technique for postpartum complications.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Shen Jicang Donates Toothache Relief Shen Jicang, an expert in internal medicine, is a well-known figure in the traditional Chinese medicine field in Shanghai. He is knowledgeable and experienced and has unique insights into men's, women's, and children's health. In the past three years, he has invented a special external medicine powder for toothache, named Toothache Relief, which specializes in treating toothache caused by cavities and wind-heat. It can immediately relieve pain and permanently eradicate the root cause, with powerful medicinal properties for clearing heat, killing insects, promoting blood circulation, and reducing swelling. It is highly effective and completely non-toxic. Moreover, this medicine is convenient to use and is given away completely free. In the past three years, countless patients with toothache have been cured, and as a result, it has been widely praised. Recently, after the News Report published Shen's thesis, the distribution was expanded, and more people became aware of it. In recent days, the number of people coming to ask for it has been overwhelming, and countless letters have piled up, resulting in the complete depletion of the large batch of Toothache Relief. Those who arrived late were filled with regret. It is now reported that Shen continues to uphold his original intention and continue to donate to benefit the public. The third batch of medicine has already been prepared and is ready. It is hoped that toothache sufferers will hurry to obtain it to get ahead of the game and not miss the opportunity. Shen's clinic is located in Jicangli, at the intersection of Beile Road and Dunshenfu Road. Those who live far away or in other cities can also send a stamped envelope to request it by mail.</p>
<p>Sekong Hospital Opens The Sekong Hospital, which strives to prevent venereal diseases, is officially opening today. With the enthusiastic support of Dr. Chu Minyi and Dr. Yin Benqiang, the hospital will undoubtedly achieve good results and showcase them to society. It is reported that although the association is not very large, it has all the necessary equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of venereal diseases, and its intentions are pure, without deception or fraud. All consultations regarding the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases and related issues are completely free of charge, and treatment only costs the price of the medicine. Poor patients will especially benefit greatly.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e186">Reading and Writing <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Sir! My previous plan for allocating these two hours of time for reading was as follows: From 8:00 to 9:00, I would read (either literary books or social science books); from 9:00 to 10:00, I would write an essay. The reason why I have not achieved any results with this plan is, first, because, as you said, I lack the "seriousness" of study in reading. Although I myself often realize that "it is not good to read without seeking deep understanding" and not to appreciate the exquisite artistic essence of the book, I have tried reading a book three or four times. However, the result is not only that I do not get a deep impression, but also that the interest fades, like beer that has lost its fizz. I have also read many new literary books and four or five social science books, but what remains in my mind is only a vague impression, especially in social science. However, when reading these books, I believe that my spirit is still focused, and there is probably not much that I do not understand. However, the impression I get is only this, which cannot help but make me feel disappointed, as if I have been splashed with cold water. Is this because my brain's memory is weak, or is it something else? Is there any way to remedy it? Now I have made a new reading plan: the most important thing is not to read a lot, but to seek the essence of a certain model book. For social science books, I have chosen "Sociology from a Materialist Historical Perspective," published by Beixin in 1930. For literature, the long stories are "The Slaughterhouse," and the short stories are blank, "Education of Love," and favorite essays in "Free Talk." I have read a few pages of the former, and I roughly understand the meaning. I only read half of it at the time. Now, when I advocate rereading it, I will read at most one chapter per day and take notes after reading each chapter, in the hope of getting a clear concept. Is this correct? As for literature, I advocate not limiting the time and flipping through it at any time, but studying its syntax, structure, such as description, etc. I hope that you can instruct me on a method of exploration.</p>
<p>Second: I have the ambition to create, but my ambition is not great. I only hope that I can achieve a general standard of smooth writing and be able to express myself at will. Judging from my current level, I don't know how far I am from that goal. But my desire to write is very strong, and every day I want to pick up a pen and write. Because I am not good at selecting and discarding materials, and I don't know how to describe them, my writing is very slow. Although I have the ambition to write every day, the result is that I can't write a short article for dozens of days because I want to write every day. I myself know that the cause of this problem is that I have not formed a complete and comprehensive whole of what I want to write in my mind, but only a vague impression. So when writing, I write this point, and then forget another point; some places are not thought of in advance, but are written unconsciously; sometimes, when I write halfway, I feel that I can't continue writing, so I read the written text to evoke the mood of the following text. So my writing is completely done while writing and thinking, and I have never finished writing in one breath. As a result, my drafts are always heavily revised and must be rewritten repeatedly (that is, this letter I am writing is also the case). This unnecessary loss in time really makes my heart ache! What makes me even more heartbroken is that I have spent extremely precious time and energy, and what I have written is not just the arrangement of words, but is completely lifeless, as rigid as a clay Buddha. And after practicing writing until now, not only is this habit difficult to change, but there is still no progress. Sometimes I am so depressed that I hit my head repeatedly, vowing that I will never write again. However, my desire to write is too strong. As long as a day passes, the unstoppable enthusiasm will tell me to sit down and write calmly. But when I see people writing, they can write it out at once, without deleting or changing a single word. It looks like a very easy and quick thing. And the writing is so thoughtful and the layout is so meticulous, which I can never do. How much I admire and regret myself! Sir! You are a person with literary cultivation and professional writing skills. I hope you will not hesitate to use your valuable experience in writing to guide me on how to improve this bad habit!</p>
<p>Furthermore: After reading the essay I attached, do you think my hope of being able to achieve a general standard of clear writing and express myself at will is not great? What about the descriptive sentences and structure in this text? I hope you will take the trouble to give me detailed instructions, which will be of great help to my future writing! (Letter from Wu Hesheng)</p>

<h3 id="e190">Displaying Beauty and Offering Ugliness <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>Beauty is welcomed by everyone, while ugliness is detested by everyone. Even a three or five-year-old child, when praised for their beauty, will have their young heart stirred with pleasant waves. How much more so for adults who are involved in society. However, beauty is not something everyone possesses; it belongs to a very few. Ugliness, on the other hand, occupies a vast territory within the population. Because beauty is so rare, its status is all the higher, and the welcome it receives is even stronger. Clever people in society, if they have no beauty to find in themselves or to display, will always try to conjure up some beauty to exchange for glory. But if, unfortunately, they have ugliness instead of beauty, they will be anxious and unable to sleep, urgently seeking ways to remedy the situation. If there is no way to think of, they must at least hide it! Otherwise, to suffer a lifetime of shame would be extremely foolish, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>The boundaries between beauty and ugliness are certainly different, and the nature of beauty and ugliness is also not fixed. In oneself, there is beauty and ugliness in appearance and body, and beauty and ugliness in decoration and expression. In the environment, there is beauty and ugliness in reputation, and beauty and ugliness in status. The former mostly belongs to women, while the latter mostly belongs to men. Women want beautiful faces, curved bodies, and modern and up-to-date decorations and expressions. Men want pure reputations and high status. Only then can they generally receive special welcomes and preferential treatment. Conversely, all kinds of unexpected contempt, abandonment, and even unforeseen disasters will befall them. Oh, beauty, what a priceless treasure to hear about.</p>
<p>Although the boundaries between beauty and ugliness described above are clearly different, they can also be accommodated and borrowed from each other. For example, actors on stage can play female roles as men, putting on an act, and male prostitutes in big cities can temporarily act as night attendants, applying rouge and powder. Self-respecting, naturally handsome men can at least take the lead in certain situations. Women can also use similar tricks. If they are born ugly and cannot be helped, they might as well speculate on their reputation, write a few poems, write a few articles, and put up the sign of a priority—Miss; then with the glorious title—female poet, female writer, they won't have to worry about no one bowing down to them.</p>
<p>So-called status has no inherent beauty or ugliness, but people with status, whether male or female, can compensate for it even if everything else about them is ugly. Don't you see how old men with high status can win the sympathy of modern girls? So the function is the same!</p>

<p>— (Written by Qian Yun) (Drawn by Dong Liang)</p>
<p>The husband's wife, A Da's mother, perhaps is too healthy, giving birth to a son as easily as laying an egg; however, she is too busy, dressing the child in the morning, preparing breakfast for the husband, and then, with her large belly, going to the small vegetable market; after returning, she tells the neighbor's wife at the door that the new store sells four catties of meat, so cheap!</p>
<p>After eating, five hundred shovels is her enjoyable work, with her belly resting on the edge of the table. When she can't draw the tiles, the neighbor's wife, unafraid of fatigue, often teaches her; A Er plays marbles on the muddy ground, A Er learns to smoke cigarettes, A Da has a fight with the neighbor's child; she only feels annoyed and scolds, "Little murderers!"; what's important is: get rich, "Pong!"</p>
<p>This wife is indispensable to her husband, but is this kind of mother needed by the children, by society?</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Five: Shedding Tears, He Bids Farewell to His Family to Return to Distant Garrison; Wind and Sand Permeate the Night as He Leaves the Border to Station in a Lonely City</p>
<p>However, the regimental commander urged me to return like this, there must be news from the front. Under these circumstances, it's probably not the time for soldiers to bring their families. He thought heavily, unknowingly the car had already arrived at Xizhimen, and the passengers got off one after another, only then did he wake up. From the long-distance bus to the tram, from the tram to the train, from the train to riding on the back of a beast, a shadow always lay across his heart, it was Gui Zhi's eyes filled with tears, yet a smile on the corner of her mouth. In a windy and sandy day, he rushed to Xifengkou. The sun was obscured by the wind and sand, and no sunlight was seen on the road. The sky was filled with a color that was neither yellow nor red. The northwest wind blew past from the sky, whistling. For people who are accustomed to living in the northern continental area, such a windy and sandy day is not considered anything special. But in this place, it was somewhat different. From afar, he saw the Great Wall, stretching like a long line on the peaks of the high mountains, rising and falling, faintly revealed in the wind and sand. Looking back and thinking of the great Beijing, the familiar seaside, the sweet home, this made one lose the courage to go forward. But he, as if drunk and enchanted, only recognized one road and walked forward, always continuing to walk. They were a group of people stationed in an old camp in the pass. Zi Qiang arrived at the regimental headquarters, seeing the regimental flag planted by the roadside outside the gate, the two guards with guns on their backs, and the heavy gray-white gate courtyard walls, all the desolate and tragic scenes were in his eyes, feeling that this trip home to get married was like a dream. He dismissed the porter and carried his luggage back to the company headquarters. Sergeant Wang Shili saw him coming, saluted, then shook his hand and said: "Company Commander Zhao, you came really fast. I thought you would only arrive tomorrow morning, I didn't expect you to arrive today." (327)</p>
<h3 id="e193">Neglect <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Qi</p>
<p>Every time I run into a friend's or relative's home, I always end up eating lunch or dinner there, and I always hear the polite words "Sorry for the poor hospitality" from my friends and relatives, especially the women.</p>
<p>This is China, where politeness is everywhere, and impoliteness can also be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>Walking on the road, you can see fellow Jiangbei brothers colliding with each other while vying to be the first to cross when the green light turns on, even breaking out into curses, even though it's all for the sake of getting to their destination first.</p>
<p>Speaking of "sorry for the poor hospitality," it is indeed a very common polite phrase, but from this, we can understand the solemnity of ancient etiquette and the respect for guests.</p>
<p>But upon closer reflection, it becomes contradictory.</p>
<p>If you are a poor friend, then it's not like that. The moment you step into the door of a friend or relative, every face will look at you with anger, as if you are their enemy, or they might even avoid you as if they were afraid of ghosts. At that time, you will really feel embarrassed to death.</p>
<p>If you want to cadge a meal, that's even more of a torture. Either they will ignore you, or they will give you a dead face. Then, not only will you not hear the words "sorry for the poor hospitality," but you will at least hear a few cold words, and what you receive will definitely be the real "neglect."</p>
<p>So, to receive the words "sorry for the poor hospitality," you must also have the appropriate qualifications!</p>
<p>Furthermore, when people have a celebration and invite you to a feast, with plenty of meat and fish, in the end, you will also hear the polite words "sorry for the poor hospitality" from the host. But please note that it is exchanged for a cost of at least two yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Gambling <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Chun</p>
<p>There is a famous gambling city in the world, a public den of gambling, which many people probably know without saying is Monte Carlo, the gambling city of France. The curious American film industry even made a movie a few years ago, set in the gambling city, called Monte Carlo, which shows that the gambling city's reputation has spread to all countries in the world.</p>
<p>Some people have said that there is also a Monte Carlo in the East, and that is our Shanghai. Whether Shanghai is the Monte Carlo of the East, that is for others to judge, and we don't need to say much. However, the matter of gambling is indeed very popular in Shanghai. Although it may not be as grand as Monte Carlo, it can still be counted in comparison. Monte Carlo relies entirely on gambling revenue to cover municipal expenses. Shanghai has never done so, which may be the difference between Shanghai and the gambling city? Gambling is indeed a very strange thing. Many large hotels and inns in Shanghai, as soon as you enter, you can hear the sound of slapping tiles. These many places are really no different from small-scale "Monte Carlos." However, this seems to be a more civilized form of gambling. Otherwise, this great city of the East would really be in chaos and become Monte Carlo the Second.</p>
<p>It is not known when gambling first began. In our country, the trend of gambling has a very long history. What we know is that in ancient times there was a gambling tool called chupu, which was probably popular for a time. Until now, all gambling is generally referred to as chupu, or sometimes called "yezi xi" (leaf game). So the gambling tool of chupu was probably a kind of playing card, also called "bose." This gambling tool was most popular before the Tang Dynasty, because it is known from historical records that Yang Guozhong, the brother of Yang Guifei, once presented chupu to Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. After the Tang Dynasty, the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties all had prohibitions against chupu, so it can be seen that the people of ancient times never did not gamble, and they never did not like gambling, which led to the court's prohibition. Ma diao was also a kind of ancient gambling tool, which some people think is the current mahjong, but in fact, mahjong only became popular in various places after the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Speaking of mahjong warfare, it was actually invented by Hong Xiuquan. During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Heavenly King occupied Jinling, and at that time the city was surrounded by Qing troops. The gates of the city were closed and no one went out. After a long time, there was a stalemate. There were fields in the city of Nanjing, so there was no fear of food shortages, and thus they were able to withstand the siege. However, the city was very lonely and there was nothing to do, so mahjong was invented to pass the time. Originally there were only one hundred and eight tiles, using the one hundred and eight heroes of Liangshan as the card faces. Later, twenty-eight tiles were added, thus creating the current one hundred and thirty-six tiles.</p>

<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>If you are holding a banquet in your home and there are many guests, as the host, you must think of some novel and interesting entertainment methods to make the guests feel interested and endlessly happy. Otherwise, even if you try your best to entertain and be very attentive, only talking and chatting, walking and sitting, eating and drinking, singing and dancing, it will always be dull and not lively. Here are a few suggestions for readers, which I hope will be welcomed.</p>
<p>Biscuit Race</p>
<p>This is a team game with a competitive nature that does not require musical performance; it is also one of the most interesting and convenient entertainment methods at banquets. The method is as follows: divide the guests into two teams, each team having the same number of people, and standing in two rows facing each other. Assuming that each team has ten people, then the host and hostess each take a basin with ten biscuits in it, and stand opposite the first person on the left of each team. After everything is ready, the team members participating in the competition put their hands behind their backs, are prohibited from extending them forward, and are not allowed to whisper to each other or talk at will. The host or hostess gives the order, shouting "one, two, three." After the shout of "three" stops, the host and hostess each pick up a biscuit from their basin and put it into the mouth of the first person on the left of the team to let him eat it, then pick up the second biscuit, move one step to the right, and stand in front of the second person in preparation. When the first person on the left sees the biscuit in his mouth, he quickly chews, the faster the better. After the biscuit is chewed, swallowed, and finished, he turns his head to the right and opens his mouth to the second person; at this time, the host or hostess should quickly put the second biscuit into the mouth of the second person. After the second person finishes eating, he takes care of the third person in the same way as the first person. Eating in this way from left to right in order, the team that finishes eating first is the winner.</p>
<p>Telephone Number</p>
<p>This is also a very interesting competitive game. At least ten people are required to participate in the competition, and another person is the caller and recorder. The ten participants are divided into two teams on average, standing opposite each other, with a distance of more than ten steps between them. Beforehand, the host should prepare twenty white cards of similar size and hardness to playing cards, divided into two sets. Each set of white cards has the numbers from zero to nine: that is, the first white card has a "zero" written on it, the second has a "one," the third has a "two," the fourth has a "three," the fifth has a "four," the sixth has a "five," the seventh has a "six," the eighth has a "seven," the ninth has a "eight," and the tenth has a "nine." Another piece of white paper and a pencil are prepared for recording scores, managed by the caller and recorder. Each team takes a set of number cards, and distributes them to their own team members. The numbers should be in order from left to right, that is, the first person on the left takes the "zero" number, and the last person takes the "nine" number. Each person should hold the number card with both hands, placing it in front of their chest, with the number facing outwards, secretly remembering it, and is not allowed to peek at it temporarily. After they are assigned and standing in order, the caller and recorder takes out a telephone directory and randomly selects a number without the same digits, and shouts it out loudly. For example, if the number called is five, seven, three, nine, then the people holding these numbers in the two teams walk forward two steps, arrange themselves in order according to the telephone number, and face left. The team whose members form a line first and without errors wins one point. After the caller and recorder records the score, the people who stepped out of the line return to their teams in order. If it is planned to hold five competitions, then after the competition is over, the team with the higher total score is the winner.</p>
<p>Charades</p>
<p>This game is most suitable for places with few people. First, divide the guests into two groups. One group stays indoors, called the guessing group; the other group goes outside, called the acting group. They take a few minutes to discuss a phrase with few words that can be expressed with actions. After agreeing, they return to the room together, and each person makes different actions. For example, if the phrase agreed upon by this group is the two words "decoration," then the members of this group, after entering the room, explain to the guessing group that it is a two-word phrase, and then make actions. They might rub their faces and pretend to pat on powder; or loosen the buttons of their clothes, pull and wave, and re-button them, making a gesture of putting on clothes; or step one foot on a chair and tie the laces of their leather shoes tightly; or comb their hair with their hands; and so on, to let the guessing group see and guess. If the guessing group cannot guess what the phrase is within three minutes, then the acting group withdraws from the room again, discusses another phrase, and comes back to perform again. If this time the guessing group guesses correctly, then the guessing group goes outside to discuss a phrase, and comes back to perform, letting the group that was acting guess. In this way, you guess and I act, I guess and you act, taking turns. It is very interesting.</p>

<h3 id="e196">This Year's Tung Wah Abdicates, French Business and Western Union Wins Group A Football Championship <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Fifteen Wins in Seventeen Matches, Already Having Thirty Points</p>
<p>The Last Match Is Irrelevant to Winning or Losing the Championship</p>
<p>You You, Tung Wah, Western Concession Police, and Chinese Soccer Team Compete for Second Place</p>
<p>This year's Group A championship of the Shanghai Western Union Football Association has fallen into the hands of the French Business Association, and there is only one match left after seventeen matches. The score is thirty, with a total of fifteen wins and only two losses. Even if the last match is lost, there will be a total of three losses. The results of Tung Wah, Chinese Soccer Team, and Western Concession Police are all five points behind the French Business Association. The French Business Association can still exceed by three points, without affecting the championship. Last year's champion Tung Wah has abdicated. After the start of the season last autumn, Tung Wah lost once to You You, again to the French Business Association, and three times to Jinan, and then forfeited against the French Business Association, and thus gave up hope. Jinan was strong at first but then declined, You You also encountered setbacks from time to time, and the Chinese Soccer Team was also often not in good form, thus allowing the French Business Association to grow day by day. The past is gone, and there is hope for the three teams of You You, Tung Wah, and Jinan, now let's add effort. The second place will be contested by the four teams of Chinese Soccer Team, Western Concession Police, You You, and Tung Wah. The results are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e198">Avenging Old Enmity, Tung Wah Defeats Jinan 3-0 <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Both Sides Use New Players, Performance Diminished</p>
<p>Tung Wah Forwards Still Sharp, Returning with Victory</p>
<p>The second meeting between Tung Wah and Jinan in the Western Union Group A football match, which was quite noticed by the general public, resulted in Tung Wah defeating Jinan 3-0, avenging the humiliation of losing to Jinan 2-0 last time. Both sides, due to the fatigue of the battle the day before, supplemented their lineups with new players, but the Jinan forwards were inferior to Tung Wah, so the offensive was not as sharp as Tung Wah. For most of the ninety minutes, they were under the pressure of Tung Wah. However, yesterday's battle was very refreshing and watchable. Both sides were very able to abide by sportsmanship, which is a rare and auspicious sight in Chinese competitions in recent years. In the first half, Tung Wah took the lead with a score of 2-0. In the second half, Jinan's counterattack was ineffective, and they lost another goal. In total, Tung Wah won with a score of 3-0.</p>
<p>After the opening kick by Center Forward Li, Tung Wah immediately adopted an absolute offensive. Li Yichen commanded Jia Wan, pressing forward step by step. Gu Shangxiang rescued dangerous balls twice. Wan Xianghua and the others attacked the Zhujiazhuang three times, going straight down the wing, with the force of a rapid wind and rain. Xing Hanjie rushed forward to meet them. Little Wan took advantage of the situation, and Gou and Zhou Guangzhong took the opportunity to peek into Jinan's hinterland. Chen Chunxiu and Zhou Honglun served the country with courtesy, causing Jia Youliang to take the opportunity to pick and send to the central position. Li Yichen unleashed his fast legs and charged towards the goal. Little Lai fell sideways, but still could not avoid this disaster, and thus the record was opened.</p>
<p>Chen Hongguang Opened Fire from Afar, Tung Wah Scored One Goal. After Tung Wah scored a goal, the momentum became even more fierce. Although Gu Shangxiang was able to act as a mainstay, it was a pity that one tree could not support a building. Therefore, Jinan's defense was chaotic and dangerous. Zhou Honglun and Chen Chunxiu, two elite soldiers, were under siege on all sides and had difficulty flying. Zhou Guangzhong was like a lion playing with the ball, using all his skills. Wan Xianghua took every opportunity to drill through, and was indeed a dangerous person. Luo Haiguang still thought of borrowing strength from behind the city, but unfortunately the blocks were not the right people, giving Tung Wah an opportunity instead. Chen Hongguang took a shot from 25 yards, rolling into the net, making it 2-0.</p>
<p>Jinan's Counterattack Was Ineffective. After the break, the positions were switched. Luo Haiguang and Gu Shangxiang commanded the large and small armies, preparing to destroy this morning's food. The momentum of the attack was like ten thousand horses galloping. Liu Shizan's feet were stiff, and he was unable to achieve anything when he had the opportunity. What could be done? Zhang Hongzao was close to the goal, but still returned empty-handed, causing the audience to sigh endlessly. At this time, Ding and Wu, the two midfielders, had been ordered to withdraw to the third line of defense. Zhou Xianyan's business was booming, accepting adversity. Within twenty minutes, he played with the ball like a moon, fortunately without any major disasters occurring.</p>
<p>Yichen Created a Straight Three. Although Chen Gongyu came from Tung Wah, his foot was surprisingly hard. With a bang to the head, the ball flew over half the field. The Tung Wah forwards were active again. The two defenders, Chen and Zhou, were unable to stop them, and corner kicks were often forced. Fortunately, Little Wan's feet were soft and weak, and he was unable to wield the knife and go straight in. Until the last three minutes, Li Yichen mixed into the tiger's mouth and swept across, Lai Zuo Rong could not escape this robbery, and thus lost with a score of 3-0.</p>

The Ministry of Education believes that the music teaching materials in all primary and secondary schools should use the textbooks approved by the Ministry. In addition to issuing orders for strict supervision, it also ordered the formulation of measures to prohibit the implementation of effective implementation, and report the handling of the situation for future reference.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Sharp Decrease in Student Enrollment at Various Universities This Semester <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Social Economic Downturn</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this semester, according to an investigation by the Shanghai News Agency, the number of students enrolled in various universities in Shanghai has decreased significantly. Guanghua University, Fudan University, and Great China University have all experienced a decrease of 100 to 200 students. Chih Tze University, which has both day and night classes, originally had over 600 students, but this semester's enrollment is less than 400. The number of students registered at the College of Political Science and Law and Jiangnan College is also lower than in the past. Even the Law School of Soochow University has experienced a decrease of about 30 students. The reasons for the decrease are complex, but the primary reason is the social economic downturn, which has made it difficult for families of high school graduates to afford the cost of higher education. The number of students in various middle schools in Shanghai has also decreased significantly compared to last semester.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Acting President of Jinan University, Shen Pengfei, Addressed All Students <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Pay Attention to the Cultivation of Moral, Intellectual, and Physical Education</p>
<p>Foreign Languages to Add Local Dialects of Southeast Asia</p>
<p>If Funds are Available, an Agricultural College Will be Established</p>
<p>Since Shen Pengfei became the acting president of National Jinan University, classes have begun on February 26th and make-up exams will be held starting today. President Shen is actively reorganizing the university. Yesterday, he issued a letter to all Jinan University students, as follows: I, Pengfei, was ordered to serve as the acting president of this university at a time of student unrest and general anxiety. Externally, we are under public scrutiny; internally, there are countless issues to be addressed. Moreover, being an incompetent person, I deeply fear failure. Fortunately, you students are well-read and understand reason. You know the importance of academic studies and recognize the need for discipline. Together, we have worked together to maintain order and restore normalcy. At the beginning of the second semester, lectures have resumed, and society is somewhat relieved. This is truly gratifying. However, the path to order and chaos is often separated by a narrow margin. For example, when managing silk, it is difficult to find the end of the thread after it has become entangled. But if you find the key, it is like the butcher解牛 (庖丁解牛), and everything can be solved easily. Also, like weaving, the thread and yarn are already in place, but if you are careless and break the spool, it will inevitably scatter immediately and cannot be recovered. Therefore, it is very difficult to seek order from chaos, but it is extremely easy to cause chaos when things are already in order. I, Pengfei, am mindful of the戒履霜 (the caution of treading on thin ice) and fear that things that are already in order will easily become chaotic. Therefore, at the beginning of this semester, I dare to sincerely guide you on the key to managing chaos and explain it to you students. The sages have said, "Things have roots and branches, affairs have beginnings and ends. Knowing what comes first and what comes later is the path to virtue." Although this seems like empty talk, it contains profound truths. If we can recognize our duties and do our best in the work that we should do, then although the tasks may be different, the results will be the same. This is why some people have recently proposed the idea of national salvation through fulfilling one's duty. Now, you students have come to this university from afar, either from Southeast Asia or from across the mountains and seas. The purpose is nothing more than to study and prepare for the world.</p>
<p>Those who seek knowledge　are fundamental. Sensual pleasures and the enjoyment of personal rights are all secondary. If we abandon the fundamental and pursue the secondary, there will be chaos. Therefore, the key to managing this is to do our best, study diligently, and not cause trouble or disrupt order by arguing over strict enforcement, heavy workloads, or excessive supervision. Any actions outside the norm should not be repeated. As for school administration, the responsibility lies with the authorities. If students have any opinions, they may express them directly for consideration. However, gathering crowds to make demands or show coercion, forming bad habits, and affecting the school's atmosphere will not be worth the losses, even if they gain something. The reputation of a school depends on the quality of its atmosphere. You students have limited years in school, but you have a long time to be in society. Once you graduate and enter society, people may discriminate against you because you come from a school with a bad atmosphere. The value of momentary excitement cannot be compared to the losses you may suffer. The purpose of establishing a school is to cultivate talents. All facilities should follow this path and aim to make the environment suitable for learning. Although this school has a special mission, its method of cultivating talents cannot be different from that of general schools. We must pay attention to</p>
<p>The Cultivation of Moral, Intellectual, and Physical Education. Consider the Chinese overseas who have traveled far to foreign countries, opened up wastelands, and struggled in lands with harsh climates. They must have special qualities to cope with the environment. During the time when European powers invaded the East and engaged in colonial expansion, they competed for the right to rule. They emphasized the rule of law to impose sanctions, but ritual and education were never promoted. Now, if we want to promote our country's inherent culture and instill it in foreign lands, we must ensure that our overseas Chinese children and those aspiring to engage in overseas Chinese education are thoroughly imbued with both traditional and modern morality. Sun Yat-sen promoted the Three Principles of the People and, at the same time, encouraged people to be loyal, filial, benevolent, loving, trustworthy, righteous, and peaceful. He must have known that both traditional and modern education are indispensable. Therefore, I hope that we can promote the spirit of the nation by sharing the above eight virtues with you students. Speaking of intellectual education, the research and teaching of academics are the main purposes of the school. However, the meaning of learning is diverse. Some are driven by the pure desire for knowledge, while others aim to learn for practical application. It depends on the individual's personality and the needs of the environment. At a time when the country is declining and the world economy is in a downturn,</p>
<p>Learning for Practical Application　should be emphasized by students. Therefore, the school's future policy should follow this goal. In addition to the literature and history courses in the Faculty of Arts, which are the main learning areas for promoting our country's inherent culture, the geography courses are the foundation for developing industries, and the education courses are needed to train teachers, full attention should be given to them. Regarding the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature, we plan to gradually increase the courses in various local dialects of Southeast Asia within the possible scope to adapt to the actual needs of various parties. The various courses in the Faculty of Science should focus on practical science so that they can be linked to various industries of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. The Faculty of Commerce should focus on industrial and commercial management, international trade, and banking courses, with the main goal of being able to obtain practical applications. If funds are available, we will establish an agricultural college, focusing on the education of agricultural and forestry management in Southeast Asia and the Northwest, to help Chinese people go overseas or overseas Chinese return to their country to cultivate and manage. This is the main point. As for physical education, in addition to focusing on maintaining the school's past reputation, we should strive to enhance</p>
<p>Sportsmanship　and promote etiquette, and encourage the development of universal health and physical fitness. For military education, in addition to having sufficient training in academic subjects, we should also focus on cultivating discipline, spirit, and teamwork, and encourage each other to achieve results, so that we can achieve the goal of physical and mental well-being. I have been at the school for less than a month, and I have been distracted by personnel matters and dealing with various affairs. I have not had time to plan the administrative and academic work in detail. Now, at the beginning of the semester, I would like to share my thoughts on the overall situation with you. If I have any further insights, I will publish them at any time to encourage you students.</p>

<p>(Zhenjiang Dispatch) The Jiangsu Education Department will be implementing the local education facilities for this year as ordered, and will pay attention to the development of village education. The report has been submitted to the Ministry of Education, and the ministry has now approved it for record. The main points of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department's improvement and development of village education facilities are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Establishing Village Education Research Associations and Training Courses: Village Education Research Associations will be established in various rural areas, bringing together people engaged in rural education in the area to study practical issues related to village education and encourage them to strive for further study. Teachers who do not meet the qualifications will attend training courses during the winter and summer vacations to enhance their knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>(2) Improving the Salaries of Rural Education Personnel: The salaries of rural education personnel have always been lower than those in urban areas, which affects the effectiveness of the work. Starting this year, the goal is to ensure that the salaries of teachers in urban and rural areas are equal.</p>
<p>(3) Improving Rural School Equipment: Rural school equipment is often simple and crude. Starting this year, funds will be actively increased to improve rural school equipment, and standards for rural school equipment will be established and ordered to be followed.</p>
<p>(4) Expanding Village Education: Starting this year, when local education funds increase, 80% of the total amount will be used for village education. Cooperative schools and cooperative classes will be actively added in various rural areas to ensure that all school-age children have the opportunity to attend school. Farmers' Education Centers will be added in various rural areas to continuously improve the knowledge of farmers, who account for more than 80% of China's population, and to enrich rural production. Each rural school and Farmers' Education Center must be attached to a public school to supplement the school's teaching. Appendix for the 22nd year.</p>

<h3 id="e228">The Crisis of China's Cotton Yarn Industry <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Qi</p>
<p>The cotton yarn industry is one of China's largest industries today, with capital of about 130 million yuan and employing over 100,000 workers. The number of large and small merchants who rely on trading cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth for a living is even greater. Moreover, cotton yarn is the raw material for cotton textiles, and cotton textiles are an indispensable necessity for the daily lives of the vast majority of Chinese people. This can be seen from the fact that cotton goods and cotton yarn account for the largest proportion of China's annual imports. Not only that, but the cotton yarn consolidated tax is also one of the government's most important sources of revenue, amounting to more than 20 million yuan annually. Therefore, the rise and fall of the cotton yarn industry is closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, which goes without saying. However, in recent years, Chinese-owned yarn mills have been affected externally by the world economic panic and the dumping of foreign yarn and cloth by imperialists, and internally by the competition and oppression of foreign-owned yarn mills in China, as well as by successive years of natural and man-made disasters. This has led to the collapse of the rural economy, a sharp decline in purchasing power, a market slump, and stagnant sales, plunging yarn mills across the country into a critical situation where they cannot continue to operate. All of these things have now become obvious facts, not theoretical issues.</p>
<p>Regarding the causes of the crisis in China's cotton yarn industry, according to my personal observations, there are roughly the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Insufficient Raw Cotton. Everyone knows that cotton is the raw material for cotton yarn, and cotton cloth is the product made from it. Therefore, the rise and fall of the cotton yarn industry is constantly determined by the high or low price of cotton and yarn. If cotton is cheap and yarn is expensive, then there is profit and prosperity; if cotton is expensive and yarn is cheap, then there is loss and decline. In the past, cotton in China was extremely cheap, not only sufficient for use, but also a major export product. However, since 1919, on the one hand, the number of domestic yarn mills has increased daily, and on the other hand, the increase in planting area and harvest amount has been minimal, so that domestic cotton is insufficient to meet the needs of various yarn mills, and a large amount of expensive foreign cotton has to be imported every year. Originally, the insufficiency of domestic raw cotton and the use of foreign raw cotton are not entirely related to the rise and fall of the yarn industry. Japan is one example. However, China's industry is backward, its technology is immature, and its capital is weak. Everything is behind others, and it cannot be compared with Japan after all. What it relies on is only cheap labor and low-priced raw materials. Now that raw cotton is insufficient and expensive foreign raw materials are used, it immediately becomes a problem. Moreover, in recent years, the high price of gold and the low price of silver, import tariffs, etc., have further increased the cost of finished products. Not only that, but the import of foreign cotton can also directly damage China's rural economy, leading to a reduction in farmers' purchasing power and affecting the sales of cotton yarn and cotton cloth. Therefore, insufficient raw cotton is one of the most fundamental causes of the crisis in China's cotton yarn industry. The following table lists the supply and consumption of cotton in China in the past ten years for reference. (Planting area is in mu, other units are in dan)</p>
<p>Year  Planting Area  Domestic Cotton Production Foreign Cotton Imports Total Supply  Yarn Mill Consumption</p>
<p>1923  29,554,053  8,310,355  639,797  8,950,152  6,033,000</p>
<p>1924  29,771,577  7,144,642  161,862  7,306,504  5,891,000</p>
<p>1925  28,121,027  7,808,882  1,006,618  8,815,500  6,037,000</p>
<p>1926  27,349,727  7,534,351  1,866,505  9,400,856  6,581,000</p>
<p>1927  27,610,276  6,243,585  968,532  7,212,117  7,200,000</p>

<p>1929  33,811,255  7,748,366  1,571,000  9,319,366  7,338,000</p>

<p>1931  37,593,012  6,399,780  3,862,864  10,662,644  8,859,968</p>

<p>(2) Inferior Quality of Chinese Cotton. Not only is the output of cotton in China insufficient to meet demand, but its quality is also very poor, making it unsuitable for spinning fine yarn and double-strand thread. This is also very clear from the table above, that is, the amount of cotton consumed by Chinese yarn mills has not increased dramatically, and the output of domestic cotton has not declined sharply; but the amount of foreign cotton imported by customs has increased rapidly, especially American cotton and Egyptian cotton. This is because American cotton and Egyptian cotton are all fine-staple cotton. In recent years, it has been difficult for China to import good American varieties in large quantities, but because cotton farmers lack knowledge and do not know how to select seeds and retain good ones, the original long-fiber American varieties have gradually degraded after several years and become coarse. According to the results of the investigation, the output of this long-fiber cotton was 2,079,543 dan in 1929, 3,169,889 dan in 1930, 2,523,650 dan in 1931, and 3,065,995 dan in 1932. On average, it is still less than 3 million dan per year, and of these 3 million dan, due to the adulteration of coarse cotton by cotton merchants, the actual amount that can be used for fine yarn is probably only half, that is, 1.5 million dan. Compared with the current amount of fine yarn produced domestically, the difference is actually far. As a result, most yarn mills have to use American cotton and Egyptian cotton to make up for the shortage. The following table lists the ratio of various types of cotton sold and used by domestic yarn mills in the past four years:</p>
<p>Year  Chinese Cotton  American Cotton  Indian Cotton  Egyptian Cotton  Other</p>
<p>1929  68.25  13.66  17.99  0.04  0.00</p>
<p>1930  63.11  13.60  22.76  0.21  0.30</p>
<p>1931  49.67  26.43  23.29  0.43  0.18</p>
<p>1932  52.13  38.58  8.81  0.45  0.03</p>
<p>(3) Oppression by the Dumping of Foreign Yarn and Cloth. In the past, China was bound by the agreed tariff, so it could not freely increase tariffs to protect its domestic industry. Although the tariff autonomy has now been recovered, it is still far from protection in practice. Generally speaking, China's tariffs are still very low compared to other countries; and in recent years, all capitalist countries in the world have been hit by an unprecedented economic panic, with production piling up like mountains. If they want to invest in foreign countries, they are blocked by tariff barriers; so they have no choice but to dump large quantities in China, which has a relatively backward industry and relatively low tariffs. Just look at the year-by-year increase in foreign goods imported into China, and you will know. The following are the figures for cotton textiles and cotton yarn since 1921 to prove this. (Unit: customs taels)</p>
<p>Year  Cotton Textiles  Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>1921  145,701,479  72,158,170</p>
<p>1922  154,124,026  71,229,571</p>
<p>1923  132,871,137  44,178,897</p>
<p>1924  154,471,049  36,867,638</p>
<p>1925  152,015,520  41,353,981</p>
<p>1926  172,122,233  31,163,048</p>
<p>1927  131,782,516  19,899,614</p>
<p>1928  166,581,215  19,222,867</p>
<p>1929  167,460,496  16,619,118</p>
<p>1930  132,886,267  12,778,344</p>
<p>1931  107,165,347  4,091,850</p>
<p>1932  72,574,258  9,357,973</p>
<p>Note: It should be specially noted in the above table that the gradual decrease in the cotton yarn section since 1922 is due to the dumping by foreign merchants setting up factories in China.</p>
<p>(4) Oppression by the Dumping of Foreign-Owned Yarn Mills in China. China's cotton yarn industry is not only oppressed by the dumping of foreign cotton yarn and cloth, but also by the dumping of foreign-owned yarn mills in China. Because China is bound by unequal treaties, imperialists can freely set up factories in China. There are roughly the following benefits for imperialists to set up factories in China: First, using extremely cheap labor; Second, using low-priced raw materials in China; Third, products sold in China are exempt from tariffs and transportation costs. At present, the factories set up by imperialists in China are mainly yarn mills, and Japan is the first among them, followed by the United Kingdom. According to a survey by the Ministry of Industry, there are a total of 43 Japanese-owned yarn mills in China, with a capital of 1,078,000,000 yuan and 1,582,056 spindles. According to another survey, there are 4 British-owned yarn mills in China, with a capital of 20,000,000 yuan and 205,320 spindles. From this point of view, only Japan plays a major role in the Chinese cotton yarn market. Japanese imperialists have always pursued a consistent policy of dumping and invading China. After the two incidents of September 18th and January 28th, although they were slightly hit by the severe boycott of the Chinese people, in order to break through this difficulty, they further devalued and dumped their products to break the Chinese anti-smuggling line and regain the Chinese market. But what is the annual output of the yarn mills they set up in China? Just look at the table below and you will know.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn   Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>Year  Chinese Yarn Mill Output  Japanese Yarn Mill Output British Yarn Mill Output Chinese Yarn Mill Output Japanese Yarn Mill Output British Yarn Mill Output</p>
<p>1923  1,019,718  422,250  31,800  | | | | | |</p>
<p>1924  1,171,575  543,718  84,500  2,490,475  1,260,000  | | |</p>
<p>1927  1,261,548  717,769  105,522  4,259,666  4,739,704  | | |</p>
<p>1928  1,377,788  695,656  125,522  6,900,038  7,58,750  | | |</p>
<p>1929  1,476,363  750,548  129,522  6,625,544  8,153,994  1,737,986</p>
<p>1930  1,400,919  823,437  76,315  6,854,091  7,587,767  | | |</p>
<p>1931  1,458,000  1,008,000  | | |  357,000  515,000  | | |</p>
<p>1932  1,427,920  805,979  | | |  260,000  255,000  | | |</p>
<p>Note: The figures from 1923 to 1930 are based on a survey by the Chinese Yarn Mill Association. Cotton yarn is in bales, and cotton cloth is in pieces. The figures for 1931 and 1932 are based on a survey by the Bank of China. Cotton yarn is in bales, and cotton cloth is in pieces.</p>
<p>(5) Weak Capital. There are a total of 82 Chinese-owned yarn mills nationwide, with 2,522,300 spindles; although there are 39 more mills and 940,244 more spindles than Japanese-owned yarn mills in China, the capital is not increasing in direct proportion, but decreasing in inverse proportion, that is, Chinese-owned yarn mills have a total capital of only 130,000,000 yuan. Japanese-owned yarn mills in China account for more than 680 yuan per spindle, while Chinese-owned yarn mills account for only more than 50 yuan per spindle. Therefore, Chinese-owned yarn mills often have businesses larger than their capital, resulting in extremely difficult financial turnover. If they encounter competition from foreign goods and foreign merchants, stagnant sales, and inability to borrow money, they will immediately go bankrupt and declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>(6) Immature Technology. Chinese-owned yarn mills are not only weak in capital, but also immature in technology. For example, Japanese-owned yarn mills in China use only 240 workers per 10,000 spindles to spin 20-count yarn, while Chinese-owned yarn mills must use 350 to 750 workers per 10,000 spindles to spin the same 20-count yarn. Therefore, although Chinese-owned yarn mills have more spindles and employ more workers than Japanese-owned yarn mills in China, the output increases very little, resulting in very high costs. Not only that, but most of the goods produced are uneven and of inferior quality.</p>
<p>(7) Financial Capital Does Not Cooperate. As mentioned above, Chinese yarn mills are weak in capital, but if financial capital is their backing and cooperates with them, it will not be difficult to barely support them and overcome the current difficulties. However, China's financial capital has never attached much importance to industrial investment, and is only enthusiastic about government bonds and real estate. Although a part of financial capital is also used by industry, due to the higher market interest rates and very harsh conditions, the interest rate is even one cent and four or five li per month. Therefore, such loans are not so much to rescue China's industry as to exploit and destroy China's industry. But what is the situation of Chinese financial capital lending to yarn mills? According to the recent two-year business reports of Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank and Bank of China, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank lent more than 23 million yuan to industry in 1931, accounting for 34.30% of the total loans. Among them, the textile industry accounted for 42.78% of the industrial loans. In 1932, the total amount of loans to the textile industry was more than 14 million taels, an increase of about 42% compared to 1931. In 1931, Bank of China lent a total of 33,674,925 yuan to industry, accounting for 10.14% of the total loans. Among them, yarn mills accounted for 47.9% of the industrial loans. In 1932, the total amount of loans to industry was 38,435,423 yuan, an increase of 7,237,769 yuan compared to 1931, accounting for 11.46% of the total loans. Among them, yarn mills accounted for 61.9% of the industrial loans. The Bank of China is very satisfied with these figures, saying that "it has done its best to maintain industry." But in reality, due to the high interest rates and the reluctance of other financial capital to lend to yarn mills, it is still of little benefit to the yarn mills themselves.</p>
<p>(8) Collapse of the Rural Economy and Sharp Decline in Farmers' Purchasing Power. Although cotton yarn and cotton cloth are necessities for the daily lives of farmers, due to the invasion of imperialism over the years, the destruction and exploitation by large and small warlords, and the destruction and attacks by natural disasters and bandits, the rural areas are becoming increasingly collapsed, farmers' purchasing power is declining sharply, and the sales of cotton yarn are stagnant. Because China's cotton yarn is not like raw silk, which is mainly based on the foreign market and supplemented by the domestic market, quite the opposite, China's cotton yarn almost relies on the domestic market; therefore, the collapse of the rural economy and the reduction of farmers' purchasing power have become a fatal blow to China's cotton yarn industry.</p>
<p>(9) Shrinking Sales Market. The so-called shrinking sales market refers to the loss of the four northeastern provinces. Since the September 18th Incident, after Japanese imperialists forcibly occupied the four northeastern provinces by force, not only did they lose vast land and abundant resources, but also because of the arrival of the iron hooves of Japanese imperialists in trade, they almost completely monopolized it. Moreover, after the establishment of the so-called Manchuria, they freely set up customs to stipulate tax rates and heavily levy commodity taxes on goods imported from mainland China. As a result, the vast market in the Northeast, which used to absorb light industrial products from mainland China, has seen a sharp decline in goods shipped in recently. Let's not talk about other things for the time being, let's just talk about cotton goods! Cotton textiles decreased from 11.6 million taels in 1931 after the incident to 8.3 million taels in the previous year; cotton yarn decreased from 20 million taels to 4.9 million taels, and it will undoubtedly decrease even more last year and this year. Therefore, the loss of the Northeast market is one of the main reasons for the current crisis in China's cotton yarn industry.</p>
<p>(10) Inadequate National Protection. It has become a consensus that the development of a country's industry depends on the strong protection and assistance of the country, especially for countries with backward industries. It goes without saying for the past of our government, and it is still not detached from protection even now. For example, foreign-owned yarn mills in China can purchase cotton and sell yarn, and can pass through the country after paying one tax, while Chinese-owned yarn mills cannot do so. There are still many exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes in various inland provinces. Another example is the cotton yarn consolidated tax regulations implemented in February 1931. Due to treaty relations, they cannot be exclusively beneficial to Chinese-owned yarn mills, but are treated equally; but in reality, they are still beneficial to foreign-owned yarn mills in China. In addition, there are many, many more, which are really too numerous to mention, but from this, we can get a glimpse of the government's inadequate protection of the cotton yarn industry.</p>
<p>In addition to this, such as the obsolescence of machinery, the irrationality of production and sales, and the shortsightedness of the yarn mill authorities who do not know how to unite, all are sufficient to constitute a crisis; but due to the limited space, I will not go into details.</p>
<h3 id="e229">The Relationship Between Cotton Grading and the Textile Industry <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Di Jian'an</p>
<p>The primary purpose of cotton grading is to facilitate the use of cotton by the textile industry and minimize unnecessary losses. Although England is not a cotton-producing country, it advocates for cotton quality standards. Textile companies rely on these standards to purchase raw cotton that meets their needs. Consequently, its textile industry is the most developed in the world. Our country is known as the world's third-largest cotton producer, yet cotton grading is still lacking. Thus, even good cotton lacks proper protection, often leading to its obscurity. Inferior cotton, on the other hand, is everywhere, which significantly hinders the development of our country's textile industry. In recent years, textile factories have favored foreign cotton due to its superior quality and ease of purchase, increasingly abandoning domestic cotton. This has led to a surge in foreign cotton imports and a decline in domestic cotton prices, causing rural bankruptcies and sluggish yarn sales, ultimately harming textile businesses, cotton merchants, and cotton farmers alike. To remedy this situation, it is imperative to promote cotton grading; however, promoting cotton grading requires the concerted effort of the entire textile industry. Due to the lack of detailed regulations for cotton grading in our country, each textile factory prioritizes its own interests. When purchasing raw cotton, penalties are imposed for poor quality, but no rewards are given for good quality, resulting in short-term gains at the expense of long-term harm. The fact that yarn factories do not follow cotton grading methods not only endangers the yarn factories themselves, but also causes significant damage to cotton-producing areas. For example, before the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921), northern Taicang produced black seed cotton. Cotton farmers were diligent in selecting cotton, resulting in clean, white, and high-quality cotton suitable for spinning around 20 counts. It was highly appreciated by yarn factories in Wuxi and Shanghai, which set up cotton purchasing offices in Taicang. Unfortunately, the buyers did not reward quality and penalize inferiority, often manipulating cotton farmers. Honest farmers with good cotton could not obtain high prices, while cunning farmers could sell inferior cotton at a reasonable price. The buyers manipulated the market, monopolizing and exploiting it. Farmers became unwilling to diligently select cotton and instead followed suit. Within a few years, good cotton gradually disappeared, and the quality declined daily, with yarn counts becoming coarser. The factories suffered significantly, with some declaring bankruptcy or closing their purchasing offices. The cotton production of Taicang was devastated, and it will not be easy to restore its former glory. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of the Yu Zhong Yarn Factory in Anqing the year before last was largely due to unfair inspection of raw cotton purchases. Cunning cotton merchants bribed inspectors, leading to the unlimited purchase of extremely inferior cotton. This angered some impartial individuals who directly transported the purchased cotton to Shanghai and other places for sale, unwilling to sell it to Yu Zhong. Because the factory used inferior cotton to spin yarn, the yarn quality was poor, and sales were sluggish. In some cases, the cotton could not even be spun. When the factory wanted to purchase better cotton, it was no longer available locally and had to be purchased from Shanghai, which increased costs and led to the risk of bankruptcy. Examples like these are numerous. Therefore, the decline of the textile industry in recent years, which has impacted the collapse of the national economy, stems primarily from the fact that textile factories do not know how to grade raw cotton. When purchasing cotton, they only consider the cotton price; they do not carefully assess the quality. Good cotton prices are not easily increased, while inferior cotton enjoys undeserved benefits. Cotton merchants, brokers, and farmers do not focus on improving cotton production but instead resort to deception. The textile industry bemoans the poor quality of domestic cotton, but it does not realize that the poor quality of domestic cotton is due to the factories' improper use of personnel and unfair selection, which contributes to the problem. People should blame the factories for their own misdeeds, which have added to our country's woes, instead of blaming others. How unclear this is! The reasons for this are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of Communication and Standardized Rules in the Textile Industry: Each factory's inspectors rely solely on their own experience to identify cotton quality, without any communication! There is no exchange of individual experiences or establishment of unified standards, which results in inspectors having different levels of ability, creating opportunities for cotton merchants to exploit and engage in fraud.</p>
<p>(2) Constraints of Low Yarn Prices: When yarn prices are low and do not match raw cotton prices, buyers cater to the owners' preferences and cannot purchase good cotton at high prices. They only care about the cost-effectiveness of cotton grades, resulting in the purchase of inferior goods. This seems cheap but is actually costly, affecting yarn quality and increasing waste cotton. In the end, the losses are greater than if they had purchased good cotton.</p>
<p>(3) Price Gouging by Buyers: The buyers or purchasing offices dispatched by textile factories are subject to the factory's price limits. Therefore, they suppress superior quality and assist inferior quality in order to balance their price gouging, regardless of the future of cotton production in that area. For example, if the average market price of cotton is 40 yuan, and the cotton is of superior quality, the price should be increased by 3 yuan, but the buyer only adds 2 yuan. Conversely, if the cotton is of inferior quality, the price should be reduced by 3 yuan, but the buyer only reduces it by 2 yuan in order to balance the price. This leaves the cotton farmer without any guarantees, and the cotton gradually deteriorates.</p>
<p>(4) Unreasonable Handling of Forward Cotton: Textile factories and cotton merchants often have forward contracts. Once the price is set, if the market price of cotton is lower than the agreed price at the time of delivery, the factory will often find various faults, such as returning the goods, increasing the weight, or deducting moisture, to compensate for their losses. Conversely, cotton merchants may also breach the contract by delivering inferior cotton, leading to frequent disputes. However, if cotton merchants deliver good cotton, the factory cannot increase the price due to the agreed price, resulting in criticism of punishing the bad and not rewarding the good.</p>
<p>(5) Competition in Trade: Another reason why it is difficult to obtain higher prices for good cotton in the raw cotton market is competition among businesses. If one company offers a particularly high price for good cotton, other companies often misunderstand and think that the price is being inflated. In order to develop their stores, they indiscriminately raise prices regardless of whether the cotton is good or not. This causes market chaos, and everyone suffers losses. Therefore, cotton merchants feel helpless in promoting good cotton, which leads to a decrease in good cotton.</p>
<p>(6) Corrupt Practices: Textile factory inspectors often privately accept bribes from sellers or are influenced by personal relationships. Their inspections vary from person to person, without a fixed approach. This leads to manipulation and oppression. Honest cotton merchants with good cotton often sell their cotton below the average price because they are not good at maneuvering, while cunning cotton merchants fraudulently obtain high prices and boast of their abilities. This causes honest cotton merchants to dwindle, while everyone strives to be cunning. This greatly impacts the improvement of cotton quality in our country.</p>
<p>The above reasons are unavoidable facts for textile factories. Therefore, if our country's textile industry wants to eliminate these malpractices and develop its business, it must unanimously promote cotton grading.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has long paid attention to cotton grading in our country. It has referenced the American cotton grade standards, collected cotton samples from various regions, and conducted research. It has made comprehensive plans for the national cotton production, and based on years of research, it has tentatively set standards. Under the same scientific theory, there is a distinction between types and grades, praising the superior and criticizing the inferior, so that cotton from various regions can have a corresponding value. This can facilitate cotton trading procedures, maintain commercial fairness, improve quality, and develop the future of the cotton industry. The categories of cotton are temporarily divided into six types based on differences in varieties and quality: long-staple American cotton, short-staple American cotton, black-seed Chinese cotton, white-seed Chinese cotton, coarse cotton, and extra-coarse cotton. As for grades, they are generally divided into five grades, with four half-grades: first grade is superior grade, second grade is high grade, third grade is medium grade, fourth grade is low grade, and fifth grade is inferior grade. The length of cotton fibers is subject to separate length standards. Observing our country's cotton market, the basic standard is medium-grade American cotton with a length of 7/8 inch (implicitly referring to the raw material for Zhengzhou cotton spinning 20s as the standard). The price of cotton from various regions is determined by adjusting the price based on this basic standard, considering the grade and length of the cotton fibers. For example, regardless of where American cotton is produced, if its grade and length are higher than the basic standard, it should receive a higher price. If its grade and length are lower than the basic standard, it should be appropriately discounted. Even cotton produced in the same region should have different prices based on the quality. (The bureau has a table of adjustments for the tentative cotton standards for reference.) This will greatly benefit the needs of the textile industry. Moreover, the grading conditions are based on the color of the cotton, the amount of impurities, and the quality of ginning. Therefore, high-grade cotton produces superior yarn with less waste cotton, while low-grade cotton produces inferior yarn with more waste cotton, which is closely related to textile production. The category of cotton and the length of the cotton fibers are related to the yarn count. If the textile industry adopts these standards and becomes familiar with the grading methods, all problems can be easily solved. If they want to spin a certain type of yarn, they can use the appropriate grade of cotton, making allocation convenient and minimizing unnecessary waste. When ordering futures, they can specify the type and grade of cotton and the price, forming a contract. If the cotton merchant delivers cotton that is of a higher grade than specified, the factory should increase the price accordingly. Conversely, the price should be reduced if the grade is lower. This type of transaction is fair. As for market price fluctuations, that is a separate issue. Neither the buyer nor the seller should engage in selfish behavior that disregards public reason due to losses. Furthermore, the government will eventually have regulations on cotton grades, and cotton merchants should establish a cotton grade inspection committee. This will stimulate the interest of cotton merchants and farmers in sorting cotton and provide a path for improvement. The work of adjusting and selecting cotton will gradually improve, and the quality of cotton will soon improve. Good cotton will be protected by grades and receive a high price, which will promote the development of the cotton planting industry. The "quality" and "quantity" issues of our country's cotton production can be resolved without further discussion. Recently, the National Economic Commission's Cotton Industry Control Committee also has plans to promote cotton grading, which is a prerequisite for the development of the cotton industry. The textile industry, being the highest level of the cotton industry, has such a close relationship with cotton grading. Why not cooperate with the government to achieve this goal?</p>

<p>Yesterday, both Chinese and foreign call loans in the market remained available for free, and bill discounting transactions were also lackluster. Early morning transfers amounted to over 2.2 million, new transactions were over 100,000, and transactions in the Small General Association were over 300,000. Bank clearing was unavailable due to the Sunday holiday. Foreign silver orders cleared by Qianzhuang were over 23 million. There were also no foreign exchange clearing. Outward remittances from various regions totaled over 300,000. Foreign pawn transactions amounted to over 400,000. In the early morning market, Jiangnan subsidiary silver was 846 yuan, slightly lower by 3.3 yuan compared to the previous day, with 4,000 jiao transacted. Guangdong subsidiary silver was 768.5 yuan in the early morning market, with 25,000 jiao transacted. Copper coins, known as "steel dollars," were priced at 500 wen, totaling 316,000 wen, with 36,024 strings transacted, valued at 11,400 foreign yuan.</p>

<p>| Number of New Accounts is Less Than One-Third of Previous Years |</p>
<p>In previous years, silver and banking industries would be in the process of expanding their business after the Lantern Festival, opening new current accounts and accounts, with at least 80% to 90% being opened. However, this year, due to poor performance last winter and the decline of commerce, many outstanding debts could not be repaid. Thus, everyone is being cautious and has not yet opened accounts as much as possible. According to people in the industry, the number of new accounts opened this year is less than one-third of previous years. (For example, if 600 accounts were opened in previous years, less than 200 accounts will be opened this year.) All the extracted accounts must be carefully considered before a decision is made. Therefore, this year, those outside the industry who want to rely on the financial community for financing may not get their wish.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Securities: Bond Market Hovered Last Week <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Resulting in a Slight Increase of About Half a Yuan</p>
<p>First Half of the Week: Investor Confidence Remained Steady and Continued to Rise</p>
<p>Second Half of the Week: Atmosphere Became Murky and Market Softened</p>
<p>Last week, from February 26th to March 1st, the China Merchants Securities Exchange was closed for one day on Monday for the settlement of February futures. There were a total of five trading days. The April futures contract began trading on Tuesday and has resumed two trading sessions each in the morning and afternoon. Initially, investor confidence remained steady, silver was abundant, and short sellers covered their positions, leading to continued gains. Subsequently, as the situation between Japan and Russia became increasingly precarious and the puppet regime in the Northeast brazenly declared independence, the atmosphere became somewhat murky, and the market hovered and softened. However, this did not have a significant impact on the government bond market. In reality, market prices were already high, which easily triggered profit-taking and speculation. Even if the market does not fall back in the short term, it will still fluctuate. The market was closed for settlement on Monday. On Tuesday, the April futures contract began trading, and the full day of four trading sessions resumed. Short sellers covered their positions, and arbitrage trading was also quite active, with market prices rising uniformly by several jiao to about one yuan. The situation was roughly the same on Wednesday, with continued gains of four or five jiao to eight or nine jiao due to abundant silver and few sellers. On Thursday, news suddenly spread that the situation between Japan and Russia had deteriorated, and the puppet regime was inaugurated, which, although inevitable, inevitably caused investor sentiment to waver slightly. Profit-taking emerged, and market prices fell by about half a yuan. Although there was an impact, it was very minor. On Friday, retail investors took profits, and large investors continued to sell, with market prices remaining sluggish. The decline continued by five to seven jiao. On Saturday, although the decline was only about three or four jiao, and some even saw a slight gain of one or two jiao, the trend did not reverse throughout the day, indicating that buyers have become more cautious. As a result of the week, market prices saw a slight increase of about half a yuan compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume was 56,852,000 yuan. The highs, lows, gains, and losses are listed below for comparison. (Unit: yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 20 suppliers from various groups (approximately 3,000+ stones). The customers' bulk purchasing of late rice suddenly weakened again, so the hope of a single line was vanished into thin air. Although there was some scattered purchasing, it was ultimately a drop in the bucket and did not help the overall situation. The situation immediately became quiet, and the market softened. For example, the Northern and Southern groups together acquired about 1,000 bales of Qinghe Si Lian goods, but the market was inevitably revised downwards. Fortunately, there were not many goods arriving, so the slight depreciation was only two to three cents. Although the arrival of Su Tong Nan Gang and other japonica rice was also scarce, sales were still stagnant in the city and rural areas. The market often showed fatigue and lack of vitality. However, sellers used the scarcity of goods to tighten prices, so there was no excessive setback. Market prices were slightly soft by two to three cents. However, Changbang japonica rice still showed a slight drop of a few cents due to continued sluggish sales. Yangjian rice was affected and also fell by a few cents. Dujian rice was still unaffected. The sales of Yinyuan rice were limited, and the market color became more tired. The market for Bianyuan rice did not show any change.</p>

<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>The issues of medical ethics and morality in medicine have been much discussed in recent years. Those who know speak of it, those who understand debate it, but each person sees it differently. It is impossible for everyone to practice what they preach. This is a shame for the medical profession. However, new customs and teachings take time to develop. It has always been this way. If we can find someone like Zhuang Yue to mold and shape us, then in a hundred years, we might be transformed. My learned friend, Mr. Song Guobin, has repeatedly emphasized medical ethics and has even written a monumental work on physician ethics, which is truly a pioneering voice in the development of ethical standards in the medical field. It should not be regarded as just another ordinary opinion. Those in the know believe that his contribution is no less than that of Yu the Great. However, in this turbid world, everyone is vying for rights. Even gentlemen who clearly understand the difference between profit and righteousness cannot avoid the struggle for rights. Even those who seek tranquility and non-action still struggle to break free, let alone we doctors who are immersed in the hustle and bustle of the world, constantly involved in commercial transactions. This is why Liu Xiahui is so admirable. Recently, Mr. Song's proposition of "Five Rights for Physicians" is a continuation of his work on physician ethics, and it truly speaks to the heart. In fact, the essence of morality and ethics is not an obligation that corresponds to the rights of others. Rather, it is the responsibility, path, scope, and concept that everyone under the heavens should fulfill. It is not something that only begins to be practiced because of the rights of the object. Therefore, it differs from law. Although physician ethics is not the same as that of ordinary people, its guiding principles are fundamental and universally valid, and are rooted in ethical principles. It should not be restricted to the duties of physicians and misinterpreted as a price for rights. Here, I argue from a legal perspective. Because physicians are subject to legal constraints, they must fulfill their legal obligations. At the same time, they are also protected by law, and can thus acquire legal rights. This is a characteristic of the relative constraint and relative maintenance of rights and obligations that exists between them. Therefore, law implicitly embodies the means to remedy moral shortcomings, but it does not constitute morality itself. Those who discuss law have always believed that law is established to compensate for the inadequacies of morality. But in fact, even if morality is complete, there should still be law. To reiterate, morality is the necessary path in life, while law is valuable when it is in place but not needed. Therefore, the righteousness and benefit of morality are like tendencies towards the east and west, while the righteousness and benefit of law are the assertions of human desires. They cannot be equated. After reading Mr. Song's "Five Rights" theory, I deeply feel that it is not a discussion of morality, but rather one based on law. Therefore, I add several legal rights as a supplement. Mr. Song will surely agree with my words, won't he?</p>
<p>(1) The right to use narcotics: Such as opium, morphine, heroin, and other narcotics that are legally prohibited. For the general public, not only are they not allowed to use them, but they are also not allowed to sell them. However, physicians can arbitrarily prescribe them to people for internal use, which is equivalent to applying them. If a pharmacist dispenses and sells them to people, it is no different from selling them. So why do physicians have this exclusive right and are not prohibited? It is limited to treating illnesses and relieving pain in good faith.</p>
<p>(2) The right to use sharp instruments to cut the human body: According to criminal law, inflicting bodily harm on others with any instrument should be punished as assault. Physicians, however, hold knives and scissors, arbitrarily excising intestines, removing tumors, opening abdomens, and dissecting skulls, performing almost all the cruelest acts in the world without being prohibited. Why? It is limited to treating illnesses and relieving pain in good faith.</p>
<p>(3) The right to detain and infringe upon a person's freedom: Physicians have the right to prohibit patients from going out and moving freely. This is not only for the mentally ill, but also for ordinary patients, under appropriate and necessary conditions, their actions can be monitored and their freedom infringed upon. In the field of plastic surgery, the constraints are even more severe. Why are such imminent threats of violence not subject to sanctions? It is limited to treating illnesses and relieving pain in good faith.</p>
<p>(4) The right to perform abortions: According to criminal law, using drugs or other methods to induce abortion in pregnant women is a crime. However, physicians are allowed to perform such acts at any time without being prohibited. Why? It is limited to maintaining the safety of the mother's body in good faith, or because of the treatment of a disease.</p>
<p>(5) The right to perform indecent acts: "Indecent acts" include selling or displaying indecent and obscene documents and pictures, as well as exposing the genitals or performing illegal acts. Also, taking advantage of a person's loss of consciousness or inability to resist to commit indecent acts is subject to appropriate penalties. However, physicians have books on reproductive physiology and pathology, diagrams of intercourse and fertilization, and examinations of the vulva in obstetrics and gynecology. Furthermore, exploration may be necessary, and if examination is impossible or surgery is required, anesthesia may be administered, causing loss of consciousness and inability to resist, and then the procedure is forcibly performed. So why is this same indecent act not prohibited for physicians? It is limited to academic research and relieving pain in good faith.</p>
<p>There are also special rights such as harming corpses, and many others. If ordinary people were to do these things, they would be committing crimes and inviting disaster. Therefore, those who abide by the law and serve the public are constantly trembling with fear, anxious to avoid them. But we doctors do them with impunity. Is it because of the supreme authority and dignity of physicians? Now, let us examine ourselves and observe. If the powerful and wealthy are tyrannical, it will ruin the country. If doctors are tyrannical, they will harm people. The saying that "great thieves do not wield bows and spears" is most worthy of our warning and deep caution. I have written this article because I believe that Mr. Song's "Five Rights" theory is written for the physicians' personal rights. My supplementary "Five Rights" theory is based on the physicians' special rights that transcend criminal law. However, both are based on legal principles and not on ethical principles. So, is the hard work of physicians in public health and relieving human suffering the price for these previous five rights and the latter five rights? That is difficult to say. As for morality and ethics, although they are also human endeavors, there are often things that arise from human nature without human intervention. Birds know filial piety, lambs know gratitude. Even animals are like this, let alone humans. Therefore, I say that those who speak of ethics should not equate it with rights and obligations. I ask Mr. Song what he thinks.</p>

<p>(2) Local Therapy: The local wound should be opened as much as possible. After the pus, necrotic tissue, and foreign objects are completely removed, apply iodine, hydrogen peroxide, or "Balsamum Perurinum" to wash the wound. Then, fill it with 50-100 units of antitoxin. In addition, there is also the method of continuously dissolving the wound with 0.5-0.75% carbolic acid water and irradiating the wound with an artificial alpine sun lamp. However, although corrosive methods were appreciated in ancient times, they are now prohibited.</p>
<p>(3) Serum Therapy: The therapeutic effect of antitoxin serum varies depending on the method of injection.</p>
<p>There are six methods of injection: subcutaneous injection, intravenous injection, arterial injection, intraneural injection, intracerebral injection, and intrathecal injection. The choice should be determined by the physician's observation. However, when injecting into the brain or spinal cord, the same amount of cerebrospinal fluid as the serum to be injected should be withdrawn first. The dosage is 100-150 units per injection into the brain or spinal cord, 100-300 units per intravenous injection, and 100 units per intraneural injection.</p>
<p>(4) Drug Therapy: Hydrated Chloral Enema, five times a day, 1 cc each time. Pontopon or morphine subcutaneous injection, several times a day, 0.02 each time. Veronal Luminal subcutaneous injection, five times a day, 0.4 each time. Numal "Roche" internal, five times a day, one tablet each time (each tablet contains 0.06). 15% magnesium sulfate solution intravenous or intramuscular injection, two to three times a day, 10 cc each time. For severe cases, 10 cc of this solution can be injected into the lumbar spine. If muscle relaxation is not observed 30 minutes after the injection, lower the head. If respiratory paralysis occurs after the magnesium sulfate injection, wash the lumbar spine with physiological saline and inject 5% calcium chloride intravenously. For those with difficulty breathing, perform a tracheotomy and oxygen inhalation.</p>
<p>For neonatal tetanus, in addition to umbilical cord disinfection, hydrated chloral enema, two to three times a day, 0.25-0.5 each time. Chloroform inhalation. Bromine agent internal use. Within the first 24-28 hours, inject 50 units of tetanus antitoxin around the umbilical cord and 50 units under the spinal dura. 5 cc of 4% magnesium sulfate solution subcutaneous injection, twice on the first day, then once a day thereafter.</p>
<p>I have a niece who studied medicine with me from a young age. She married into the Xie family of Luhang and had a son named Zongxuan. He died at only seven months old. She was overwhelmed with grief, but thinking of her young son in her arms, she continued the family line as a consolation. She took good care of him and cherished him like a precious pearl. At the age of seven, he could understand poetry and prose. Everyone who saw him praised him, saying that the Xie family had an heir. One day in October of the 21st year of the Republic of China, he was playing in the courtyard in front of the door with a glass bottle in his hand. He accidentally fell and broke the bottle, injuring his hand. He was bleeding profusely. His mother immediately applied medicine and bandaged it. Seven days later, she came to my house for something. He was still playing with the other children during the day, but in the evening he had a slight fever. By midnight, his fever was high, and he suddenly showed signs of lockjaw. His mother immediately suspected tetanus. However, because she lived in the countryside and it was the middle of the night, there was no doctor to call and no medicine to use. She had no choice but to wait for dawn and send him to a hospital in Shanghai. When they examined the wound, it smelled unbearably rotten. Examination revealed tetanus bacteria. Serum was immediately injected, but it was ineffective. It is common for young children to fall and get injured. However, because the injury allowed tetanus bacteria to enter, it was fatal. Although it can be said to be fate, it was actually a mistake in the initial treatment. I was moved by this, so I wrote this article to warn the world.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Common Sense Question and Answer on Diseases <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(2)(15) Croupous Pneumonia (Continued)</p>
<p>(Q) What are the different variations in the symptoms and course of croupous pneumonia?</p>
<p>(A) There are various variations, such as central pneumonia, migratory pneumonia, drunkard's pneumonia, asthenic pneumonia, pediatric pneumonia, and geriatric pneumonia.</p>
<p>(Q) What is central pneumonia?</p>
<p>(A) Central pneumonia has the same symptoms as the common type, but the lesion is limited to the hilar region and does not reach the edge.</p>
<p>(Q) What is migratory pneumonia?</p>
<p>(A) It means that the pneumonia lesion migrates from one lobe of the lung to another. Therefore, the symptoms continue to wax and wane, and the course of the disease is prolonged.</p>
<p>(Q) What is drunkard's pneumonia?</p>
<p>(A) Drunkard's pneumonia presents very severe symptoms during its course. They already complain of intense general fatigue in the early stages of the disease, fall into delirium, have tremors in their fingers, and see hallucinations of various small animals. They mostly take the path to death.</p>
<p>(Q) What is asthenic pneumonia?</p>
<p>(A) The patient is very weak, the lips and tongue are dry, the muscles tremble, and they fall into a coma. The course is very severe. There are various types of fever. The sputum often does not have a rusty color, and there is also a lack of sputum. There are also symptoms such as typhoid fever, with splenomegaly, proteinuria, and flatulence. Jaundice is also present.</p>
<p>(Q) What is pediatric pneumonia like?</p>
<p>(A) It does not start with chills, but often has severe delirium and convulsions, and very little sputum. The prognosis is generally good.</p>
<p>(Q) What is geriatric pneumonia like?</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>(A) The onset is very gradual: there is less fever, but the heart is easily weakened, and the danger is great.</p>
<p>(Q) When does croupous pneumonia not present typical symptoms?</p>
<p>(A) It does not present typical symptoms when the patient has heart disease, emphysema, kidney disease, or excessive fat. If a person already has a wasting disease, there is a risk of early heart failure.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any complications during the course of this disease?</p>
<p>(A) Yes, such as dry pleurisy, empyema, pulmonary gangrene, and liver abscess. There are also complications of pericarditis or meningitis.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the prognosis of croupous pneumonia?</p>
<p>(A) Generally, there is not much danger in young people. The prognosis is poor for the elderly, patients with heart disease, emphysema, kyphosis, diabetes, myopathy, kidney disease, pregnancy, and drunkards.</p>
<p>(Q) How should this disease be treated?</p>
<p>(A) The patient should be absolutely bedridden and quiet. Apply warm, moist compresses to the chest. Place ice packs on the heart and head. Give liquid foods. Internally, administer ipecac infusion, senega infusion, and asafoetida water as expectorants. Inject camphor, digitalis, and caffeine as cardiac stimulants. Quinine injections or internal administration of Optochin can be used as antipyretics. Pneumonia serum can be injected in children. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e241">More on Gonococci <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yanggao</p>
<p>Since Neisser discovered gonococci in 1879, Bumm later definitively recognized it as the causative agent of gonorrhea. This is because he purely cultured this coccus using artificial methods (pure culture means culturing one specific bacteria from a mixture of bacteria), and was able to use this cultured gonococcus to create an artificial (intentional) true gonorrhea in the urethra of a healthy person. Thus, the previous doubts about the causative agent were completely dispelled.</p>
<p>The nature of gonococcus itself can be said to have been thoroughly researched to this day. We can even divide gonococcus into several subtypes (this method of analysis is similar to distinguishing individual personalities within the same human race. Such a precise procedure is not surprising in a large body like the human body, but the fact that it can be done in such microorganisms shows the progress of microbiology today). The length of gonococcus is equal to 1.6 μm (one micrometer is equal to one thousandth of a millimeter), and the width is even less than 1 μm (0.6 μm), so one can imagine its actual size. (Human blood, as seen with the naked eye, is a fluid, but we know that it is not)</p>
<p>It is something like water, containing a very large number of shaped bodies such as red blood cells and white blood cells. White blood cells are large, and red blood cells are small. These red blood cells are 7 μm in size. If we compare gonococcus to them, it is only a fraction of its volume.) Human white blood cells are two to three times larger than red blood cells (approximately 15 μm in length), and can contain more than a hundred gonococci (normally not so many). Gonococcus is a non-motile, heat-sensitive (damaged above 40 degrees Celsius), and desiccation-sensitive pathogen that is easily disinfected. Because its viability (outside the human body) is extremely small (usually only one hour), when culturing this pathogen, it is best to immediately inoculate it on a suitable (warm) culture medium after extracting the pathological fluid, so that better results can be obtained.</p>
<p>When it comes to examining gonococci, it is of course not difficult in acute gonorrhea (urethritis or conjunctivitis), but it is a more difficult problem in chronic gonorrhea. In addition to clinical symptom diagnosis and provocation, other bacteriological tests, such as serum reactions, microscopic examination of pus, and culture, are needed. If these methods are used at the right time, a large proportion of patients can be given a satisfactory diagnosis in today's situation. (The reason why I say this last sentence is because I have seen many patients who, after contracting this disease, feel great mental pain and are constantly in doubt, wondering if their gonorrhea is cured or not. Therefore, the speaker takes this opportunity to hope that those who are not yet infected will pay attention to prevention, and declares the great harm of venereal diseases.)</p>
<p>The amount of gonorrhea is directly proportional to the progress of civilization. Therefore, there are many people living in this 20th century who suffer from this disease. According to the statistics of German physician Erb, 50% of all his patients (2,000 men) had contracted this disease. According to the statistics of W Fisther, on average, people living in large cities (up to the age of 50) have been infected with gonorrhea one and a half times. Regardless of whether the above statistics are correct or not, the number of people suffering from this disease in the West is indeed not small. As our country gradually becomes Westernized, and Shanghai is one of the world's major cities, the number of people suffering from gonorrhea, although difficult to count, is undoubtedly not small.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must pay more attention to public health regarding this disease and other venereal diseases. The methods can be divided into two parts: First, the government can use special regulations to specifically manage venereal diseases that endanger the nation (Germany has a precedent). Second, popular propaganda (voluntary by the public) can be used to make the public understand the dangers of venereal diseases and their prevention methods.</p>
<p>Two major dangers of gonorrhea:</p>
<p>(1) Mothers with gonorrhea often infect their babies with the disease, resulting in ophthalmia neonatorum.</p>
<p>(2) Gonorrhea can reduce the national productivity (according to the statistics of Fischel, approximately 40% to 50% of infertile mothers are infertile because they have gonorrhea (other dangers to the body are temporarily not taken into account)).</p>
<p>Drug prevention:</p>
<p>Because gonococcus is extremely sensitive to silver preparations, Credé used it to drip into the eyes of newborns to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum. Later, some people applied this method to the genital area and also obtained considerable results (other chemicals are temporarily not taken into account).</p>
<p>In our country, we still have old-fashioned moral considerations. Many people are unwilling to treat this disease properly for fear that people will find out, especially women. In my opinion, this kind of thinking seems unnecessary, especially since doctors originally have an obligation to keep patients' secrets.</p>
<h3 id="e242">A Brief Discussion of Feverish Diseases (Part 1) <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Kangbai</p>
<p>A healthy human body temperature is usually close to 37 degrees Celsius on a thermometer. Anything above this is considered a fever, which is commonly known as "cold and hot." The occurrence of fever is due to various pathogens invading the human body, causing an imbalance between the body's heat generation and dissipation regulation mechanisms, resulting in an increase in temperature and disturbances in the respiratory, digestive, circulatory, nervous, and excretory organs, which are commonly seen.</p>
<p>When chemical toxins or bacterial toxins invade the blood, causing fever through poisoning, it is called toxic fever. However, there are times when fever occurs without the invasion of fever-causing substances in the blood, which is called non-toxic fever, such as nervous fever caused by nerve disorders, or the strange fever patterns of hysteria.</p>
<p>The principle of body temperature increase is due to increased heat generation and decreased heat dissipation. The decrease in heat dissipation is due to the contraction of small arteries, resulting in reduced heat dissipation from the lungs and skin surface. At the same time, metabolic functions are abnormally enhanced, but the excess heat still cannot be reduced as a result.</p>
<p>The course of feverish diseases can be broadly divided into the following four stages:</p>
<p>(1) Increasing Stage: Feverish diseases vary in length and duration. When the body temperature begins to rise, the nerves around the blood vessels are stimulated, causing the capillaries of the skin to contract. At the same time, the pulse is fine, hard, and rapid, breathing is shallow, clear, and frequent, and there are uncomfortable sensations such as headache and chills. As heat generation increases and heat dissipation decreases, the body temperature rises rapidly to the second stage in about one or two hours. For those with prolonged fever, there is often no aversion to cold at the beginning, and the fever rises gradually, reaching the second stage after about one to several days.</p>
<p>(2) Peak Stage: This is the most severe stage of feverish diseases. The excitement of blood vessels and nerves remains unabated, and the increase in heat generation continues. Breathing is rapid, the pulse is frequent, and the patient experiences thirst, anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite, and reduced secretions. Moreover, due to the abnormality of muscle temperature and heat dissipation, the skin may be pale and cold, or flushed and hot. If the fever is too high, it can damage the heart muscle, resulting in heart failure. If the fever does not exceed 39 degrees Celsius, it may not cause any harm. The duration of this stage varies, from several hours to as long as several weeks, as in typhoid fever.</p>
<p>(3) Decreasing Stage: Once the patient reaches this stage, the skin's blood vessels gradually dilate and become congested. Profuse sweating increases heat dissipation, and the fever subsides. However, the length of the process varies. If the heat subsides in a short time, from two to three hours to thirty-six hours, it is called defervescence by crisis. If it takes a long time, from two to three days to three or four days, gradually decreasing by one or two degrees each morning until reaching normal temperature, it is called defervescence by lysis. After the fever subsides, although the pulse is still weak, the patient feels refreshed and relieved of a heavy burden, and falls asleep peacefully due to fatigue and thirst.</p>
<p>(4) Recovery Stage: Once the patient reaches this stage, the body temperature is often no different from when they were healthy. However, there are also cases where it drops below normal temperature, taking two or three days to return to normal. There are also those who experience mild fever every night during this stage.</p>
<p>The body temperature of feverish diseases usually decreases in the morning and rises in the evening. However, there are also cases where it rises in the morning and decreases in the evening, or fluctuates several times a day. Here, in the peak stage, I distinguish between the following three types based on the morning and evening fluctuations:</p>
<p>(1) Continued Fever (Febris Continea): The difference between morning and evening temperature fluctuations is minimal. The fever generally remains at the same level, often persisting for five or six days, or one or two weeks, before the fever subsides. It is seen in acute infectious diseases and acute inflammation.</p>
<p>(2) Remittent Fever (Febris Remitens): The difference between morning and evening fluctuations is very large, exceeding the norm. It is often seen in mild inflammation and chronic diseases.</p>
<p>(3) Intermittent Fever (Febris Intermittens): Normal temperature and high temperature alternate regularly, either every day, every other day, every three days, or every week. Examples include malaria and relapsing fever.</p>
<p>There are also ephemeral fever and atypical fever. The former lasts for a very short time, while the latter is an irregular fever with no fixed daily fluctuations. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e243">The Current Society's Need for Medical Knowledge <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Wanbai</p>
<p>The complexity and contradictions of medical concepts in our society have reached their peak today. When faced with a difficult-to-treat illness, people often resort to both Western and Chinese medicine haphazardly, without knowing what to do. They may be swayed by recommendations from relatives and friends or misled by exaggerated advertisements, trying them out without sufficient knowledge to distinguish and make decisions. This is one aspect.</p>
<p>Even when a doctor has been consulted, there is rarely long-term trust. People often judge the effectiveness of the treatment solely based on whether one dose of medicine shows immediate results. If not, they change doctors frequently without thinking it strange, and the doctors invited to treat lack the opportunity to be genuinely responsible. This is another aspect.</p>
<p>Patients are often very familiar with the prescriptions and medications of traditional Chinese doctors, frequently liking to participate in the discussion to show their knowledge. However, they lack basic scientific knowledge regarding the terminology and theories of modern medicine, often staring blankly and unable to understand. Therefore, trust cannot arise. This is a third aspect. Considering these points, if we want patients to benefit more from scientific treatments, we must disseminate common-sense knowledge of modern medicine to society on a large scale.</p>
<p>The most common methods used in the past to disseminate medical knowledge are twofold: one is literary propaganda, and the other is lectures at gatherings. These include medical articles in newspapers and magazines and health talks at meetings and schools. However, their effectiveness is limited to middle- and upper-class people who can read newspapers or a small number of occasional audience members. It is very difficult to find effective methods to enlighten the women in families who have the greatest authority over medical issues.</p>
<p>Recently, radio broadcasting has become popular because it can reach families in various locations, and people of all ages enjoy listening. Its influence is unparalleled. According to surveys, over 200,000 radios have already been sold in Shanghai. If proper methods are used for promotion, it would be an unparalleled tool for disseminating new medical knowledge.</p>
<p>Last spring, due to the war, I came to Shanghai and happened to witness the completion of the Chinese-Western Radio Station. The owner was an old friend and invited me to give talks on common medical knowledge at the station. I felt that this aligned with my long-held aspiration to serve society, so I agreed to fulfill this obligation, but I absolutely would not promote any individual or organization. Later, I gave systematic talks on new medical knowledge every day at noon. Unexpectedly, listeners from near and far sent letters expressing their appreciation, sometimes discussing medical issues. In my answers, I never recommended specific drugs, hospitals, or doctors, so listeners knew that what I said had no ulterior motive or background. Many listeners in various locations gathered friends and relatives at scheduled times to listen and recorded the lectures daily for study. The eagerness of society for medical knowledge is evident.</p>
<p>This winter, Christians, recognizing that commercial radio stations have too many entertainment programs and advertisements, initiated the establishment of a completely charitable gospel broadcasting station and appointed me to oversee everything. I specifically scheduled a medical and health program at 8 PM, the most convenient time, and invited people from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and the Physicians' Association to give talks on a rotating basis. Listeners from various locations responded with even greater enthusiasm. Now, other radio stations are also following suit, increasing their medical programming, which is a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>Based on past experience, radio broadcasting will inevitably become increasingly developed. New radio stations are also being built in various provinces and cities one after another. My colleagues in the new medical community should make good use of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to cooperate with radio stations in various locations and sacrifice their valuable time to undertake voluntary lectures to promote scientific understanding of new medicine to the public. If we can gather like-minded people and build our own radio station dedicated to medical and health education, the effect would be even greater. Are you all considering this?</p>

<h3 id="e244">Sister Flowers <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhen</p>
<p>Ever since I watched the "Love and Hatred" starring Hu Die two years ago and regretted it immensely, I have been unwilling to watch domestic films no matter what. However, due to the promotion of friends, I recently watched "Sister Flowers" starring Hu Die. In this film, I must say that Hu Die has achieved success.</p>
<p>The events in this film, such as the warlords' exorbitant taxes and levies, extravagance, and debauchery, and the people's suffering, destitution, and displacement, although said to be from the 13th year of the Republic of China, are actually eternally new situations. Hu Die and the actress who played the old mother were able to realistically portray the plight of the poor, evoking shared emotions in the audience, which is precisely the success of art.</p>
<p>However, the problem raised by this film is not solved by its artistic success. From a purely artistic point of view, it is enough to present the facts, and it seems unnecessary to propose any solutions, as used in the Shanghai propaganda. This can be said to be a realistic approach. Its power lies in exposing the facts, reminding the world, and giving the audience a profound hint. But this is like the 19th century. Just as Ibsen's plays were called "problem plays," "Sister Flowers" only raises a problem. What other paths in life do ordinary people have besides sending their daughters to warlords as concubines or serving warlords?</p>
<p>After watching the film, on the way home from the New Light Cinema, I thought about this. Hu Die's cries seemed to still echo in my ears, and the painful scene of abandoning children and leaving home also seemed to flash before my eyes. I thought and walked across the road. Looking up, I saw the shop selling aviation lottery tickets facing me. Then the previous thought surfaced in my mind, "Isn't this a path in life?" Perhaps this is where the answer to the question raised by "Sister Flowers" lies. Unfortunately, this lottery only happens every few months. How wonderful it would be if there were a grand prize to be hoped for every day!</p>
<h3 id="e245">A Small Island in the South <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Meng</p>
<p>During the day, climbing up the small slope, the surrounding green sea can be seen refreshing. At night, sleeping on the veranda, the myriad lights of Penang will rush towards you from the distant sea. This is a small island in the Indian Ocean, adjacent to the Malay Peninsula.</p>
<p>In mid-April 1930, I traveled from Burma to Singapore due to business. The ship passed Penang, intending to change course and land to take the Malay Federation train. Unexpectedly, the local health bureau detained me and a group of Indians on this small island to disinfect us for a week. The reason was that the places we departed from, such as Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, and Rangoon, had all been declared plague ports during the summer. (In India and Burma, schools start their summer vacations at the end of March in the Gregorian calendar.) However, this was limited to those of us traveling in third class because when we were invited onto the small boat to paddle to the small island, the first- and second-class passengers still joyfully and freely went ashore.</p>
<p>However, during this week, I truly enjoyed unprecedented tranquility. Every day, when the radiance of the red sun brushed away the morning mist on the sea, someone would run over to call us up, and the entire team would stand on the sand covered by the shade of trees, baring our upper bodies. The white doctor, leading three or four Malay assistants, would examine us one by one, as if an officer were inspecting new recruits, without any kindness. However, people who have always been disregarded by society can actually receive such care, which is truly gratifying. Although, there are other factors deeply hidden within. At about nine o'clock in the morning, a ration was usually given to each person, such as dried fish, potatoes, milk, and eggs, which were always sufficient. As for the Indians, perhaps because they were Indians, they could especially receive beef or chicken.</p>
<p>We lived in military-style (Camp) houses, with walls that were empty above the waist. The clear sea breeze and the bright moon in the mountains could freely visit us. During the long days, we had nothing to do, so we climbed up on the walls and sat, leisurely watching the sails swaying on the waves, whistling softly. At night, we slept on the smooth cement floor, listening quietly to the songs of the South Indians, and drifted happily into dreams. Half of the open space outside the house was paved with cement, which could be used for walking in the morning and evening and for drying clothes. The other half was covered with mud and sand, shaded by green trees. Twice a day, we would light a bonfire under the trees to cook food.</p>
<p>Among the many Indians, besides me, a wanderer from a foreign land, there was also a family from Bhutan. The melancholy atmosphere of their small family often attracted my attention. The man was short and sturdy, with a long curved knife hanging on his waist. His head was shaved, leaving only a tuft of hair on the top, which looked like a child's. This was originally a religious symbol. Hindu followers in India generally had this style. It seems that Bhutanese culture is greatly influenced by India. He seemed to be constantly angry, and two ragged and dirty children sat blankly by their mother's side all day, seemingly too scared to move. The mother pursed her lips and quietly mended her torn clothes. When I saw them, I felt as if I were on the Himalayas, facing the gloomy sky and the snow that never melts. The bright light of the southern country seemed to be of no benefit to them! I wanted to ask, "Why did you leave your hometown?" But I didn't know what language to use because I didn't understand Bhutanese. However, a week of contact told me everything in their eyebrows. Can't a wanderer see the wandering factors of another person?</p>
<h3 id="e246">Random Notes (Continued) <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Chang</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Some people indignantly say that the social changes in China over the past decade or so are reflected in literary works as nothing more than a blank sheet of paper. This statement is certainly an overstatement, but it shows that creation cannot powerfully reflect society. Therefore, the production of great works is really not an easy thing. An Zhiyuan wrote to Cai Manfu, saying, "People often say that the An Lushan Rebellion only resulted in a collection of poems by Du Fu. Since the Bingzi year (1936), for more than a decade, such a huge world has been repeatedly manipulated and reorganized several times, resulting in today's situation. I wonder if there are still any old men like Du Fu who are observing from the sidelines? Having the time but not the talent is also a great flaw of heaven and earth." This is truly a portrait of today's literary scene. I am looking forward to the production of great works.</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>Xu Fang also said, "The Chu madman Jieni is the most of the Spring and Autumn period."</p>
<p>A cold person. However, savoring his words, he is not the coldest person in the world, but precisely the hottest person in the world. When it is extremely hot and there is nothing to be done, one has to return to the cold. Extreme heat inevitably leads to extreme cold, which is why one sighs while riding a raft." This is precisely the origin of the production of so-called humor literature and satire literature.</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>"Sorrow" and "illness" are the capital of scholars. This statement is very strange, but it is also the most common and most ordinary explanation throughout history. Zeng Furen wrote to Qiu Xiaolu, saying, "Your letter says that you are in sorrow and illness. These two words are the capital for us scholars to read and write books. If we were in happiness and strength, we would not know how much more romantic and enjoyable it would be, and it may not be harmful to static exercises." This is nothing more than adding a footnote to this statement.</p>
<p>(8)</p>
<p>According to Li Qing, rewriting is also one of the competitions among literati. He said, "People only know that dripping ink on paper and writing hundreds of words in a moment is the ultimate. But they do not know that wielding the pen and writing dozens of lines in a moment is also the ultimate joy. Knowing it yourself is like this, let alone the onlookers. In the past, Yuan Fuchu had a work, and Yu Bosheng reduced it by one hundred and twenty words, and Fuchu also shouted quickly and accurately. This is a competition among literati."</p>
<h3 id="e247">Miscellaneous Talk on Humor <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>The year 1933 was the "National Products Year" for the Chinese people, but for the "Shanghai School" literati, it was the "Humor Year." The most popular articles this year were humor articles. Compared to the "National Products Year" with "200 million yuan of imported Japanese goods," the achievements of the "Humor Year" seem to be much better. From "The Analects" onwards, many publications, large and small, were swept away by the trend of humor. And the remaining influence has not yet faded. Probably in this "Women's National Products Year" of 1934, the sales of "The Analects" will still not decrease, right?</p>
<p>What is "humor"? Everyone already knows that it is the translated name of a foreign word, Humor. What kind of thing is Humor? Many experts discussed it in "The Analects" last year, but they still couldn't give us a clue. Until recently, Mr. Lin Yutang's three articles on humor, upper, middle, and lower, can be said to be the most detailed theory on humor. Detailed is detailed, but still, he still cannot give us a concrete, clear, and simple definition. Probably, as Maurice Decobra said, the question of "what is humor" is "a more troublesome problem than the problem of universal gravitation! It is an irregular polygon in literary criticism! No one can ever analyze the psychology of a humor writer. This psychology is elusive, like a butterfly chased by biologists. Just when you think you have caught it, it escapes."</p>
<p>Speaking of Maurice Decobra, everyone remembers that he was a French writer who came to Shanghai last year. The Shanghainese welcomed him as a humorist, like welcoming Bernard Shaw, but of course not as grandly as welcoming Shaw. As usual, our journalists held an oral exam for him, and he answered with humorous remarks, but according to "The Analects," his answers did not count as humor. Moreover, his words that he found Chinese women very beautiful and was fascinated by them aroused the protest of a "girl" in Beiping, which was very boring. From this, we can also know that he is not a skilled humorist.</p>
<p>But he is putting his heart into studying humor. Recently, I saw a book he wrote called "Laughter in the Fog," which is an anthology of English and American humor writers he edited. In the front is his preface, entitled "Anglo-Saxon Humor."</p>
<p>The opening of this preface is the few sentences quoted above. Then, he said, "Many people often try to define humor. Some propose archaeological definitions, some propose philosophical ambiguous and profound definitions, some propose Euclidean theorem-like strict definitions... and various others. These all have some truth, but none of them are perfect."</p>
<p>Therefore, he spent another effort soliciting definitions of humor from many English and American humor writers.</p>
<p>Many people responded to his work. Now I will copy a few of them below:</p>
<p>"Humor cannot be defined. It is a major element that makes people laugh." — George Bernard Shaw</p>
<p>"I don't believe that humor can be explained. But in my opinion, humor is something that... moves us with its humor." — Jerome K. Jerome</p>
<p>"I often think that humor is like the oxygen in the air we breathe. It creates and maintains human laughter. It can certainly create many other more important things, but laughter is the first." — R. C. Carton</p>
<p>"Humor is the smile in the eyes of the wise." — Israel Zangwill</p>
<p>"Alas! I am always trying to define humor, but I always fail! The most popular attitude among us is: it is better to mock the protagonist of a story than to laugh with him." — W. Pett Ridge</p>
<p>"We might say that this is the pleasant thought of someone who is not worldly." — F. Anstey</p>
<p>People often distinguish wit and humor from the distinction of race or country. They say that wit is a characteristic of the Latin race, while humor belongs to the northern race, such as the Anglo-Saxons or Scandinavians. I think this distinction is arbitrary because there are many examples proving that Northerners also have wit, and Southern Europeans also have humor. I think the difference between the two is actually produced by different temperaments. In my opinion, humor is a subtle observation of the ever-changing life, and it is the satirical power that destroys melancholy thoughts. This satire sometimes takes a serious attitude and sometimes takes a playful attitude. In short, it is to make us temporarily feel the meaninglessness of those things that disturb our hearts." — W. L. Courteney (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Miao Chongqun</p>
<p>The station is very lively today: the train is crowded with all kinds of people, and the platform is also crowded with all kinds of people. In the dark mass, there are also coffins nailed with six planks, canvas beds with no one lying on them, bundles of large guns, and bundles of hand grenades made by Shanxi people... On the opposite train, red cross flags and swastika flags are inserted, and it is full of soldiers who are seriously injured and cannot move...</p>
<p>The closer to the locomotive, the more chaotic it is; in fact, the locomotive has not yet arrived, and even if it arrives, it will probably be drowned out by this chaotic noise and cannot be heard. But the further back you go, the quieter it becomes, and the degree of quietness can be followed by the number of vehicles: second class | second class | first class | first class dining car | first class sleeping car... Wagon-Lits sleeping car...</p>
<p>This time, the Wagon-Lits sleeping car contained an urn of ashes of an "international hero." Two wreaths were placed on one side, setting off this originally magnificent car even more beautifully and lively.</p>
<p>All the Japanese soldiers who had just come out of the protection zone were gathered here. They lined up along the train in two rows, like two "heaven cards" connected together.</p>
<p>An officer with a thick Charlie Chaplin-style mustache looked very hurried and serious, going up and down the car for a while. As the departure time was approaching, he ran to Shuiguan in the most regular pace. Because the sound of his running footsteps calmed our chaotic station a lot, and naturally opened a way for him. From this moment of calmness, we could see our traffic police, station master | wearing three layers and eight layers of golden hoops | quietly hiding in the crowd like ghosts. An officer in a formal dress and a thousand-layer-sole shoes even turned his head when he was lighting a cigarette. What was he thinking? On the front line, we will eventually have a day to meet!</p>
<p>The departure bell rang, and the officer with the Charlie Chaplin mustache hurried back. He held a three-legged bronze incense burner and a few incense sticks in his hand, running as regularly as when he left. It was just that his mustache was too heavy, fanning up and down as he ran, as if it were really fake, losing some dignity and carrying a funny taste.</p>
<p>"Wo Lou Wo Lou!"</p>
<p>Not understanding what he was shouting, the two rows of short-legged soldiers stood at attention following this command.</p>
<p>The car began to move.</p>
<p>Soon, there was another sound:</p>
<p>"Wo Lou Wo Lou! Wo Li Lou!"</p>
<p>This time the sound seemed a little more complicated, but it was even more unclear what it meant. Only saw that the two rows of short-legged soldiers changed from two rows of "heaven cards" to four rows of "long threes." They saluted the train that was gradually moving away. On our train were "warriors wrapped in horsehide corpses" | on our train were executioners who slaughtered our own parents, elders, and brothers.</p>
<p>The station suddenly became much quieter. Only those wounded soldiers who could not leave were left, lying there without even groaning. There were also the thin-slab coffins that were left behind, containing the bones of our silent and unnamed warriors.</p>
<p>The outside of the station was really lively to death. Tens of thousands of pieces of luggage were almost piled up in the middle of the street. Who knows where they are going to be transported?</p>

<h3 id="e249">The Bitter Life of Literati <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>The global economic panic is spreading everywhere like wildfire. The merchant class can be said to be the most affected, especially small-capital businesses. The fall in prices, the reduction in purchasing power, and the closure or bankruptcy of stores on the market that cannot be maintained are happening every day. Under this atmosphere of recession, the sharp decline in the bookstore business is naturally not surprising.</p>
<p>In a previous article in this publication, Mr. Wen Li wrote an article "New Books Sold by the Catty." After reading this news, what I felt was truly a mixture of crying and laughter.</p>
<p>In this day and age, except for a very few writers with special status, whose monthly income is enough to cover food, clothing, and shelter, almost all other pen-holders are living fragmented lives, gritting their teeth and dealing with the poor ghost all day long. Occasionally, there are clever and capable people who change their careers or rush into officialdom, but that is very rare. And those who have no other way to go can only bury themselves in hard work until they die of poverty and starvation.</p>
<p>Living by eating one's own blood is painful enough, but what is even more tragic is that even if one exhausts one's blood, one cannot obtain even the minimum warmth and food, and is still oppressed by hunger and cold. Famous writers can still use their reputation to gain various conveniences in their sales, but what about unknown writers? It is not known how many difficulties, many twists and turns, and the white eyes of the big-bellied merchants they go through before they can sell a manuscript and obtain even enough to compensate for the loss of paper and pens.</p>
<p>In the past, people often regarded literati as remarkable figures in society. That is a big mistake. In fact, the status and life of literati in society are not as good as everyone else. To say it sadly, they are far inferior to the prostitute class. Prostitutes only sell their bodies in exchange for considerable remuneration, while literati not only sell their bodies, but also sell their souls, and the result is not worth the loss. What is more sorrowful than this?</p>
<p>Originally, books that cannot be eaten when hungry or worn when cold should have long been regarded as insignificant toys by some people.</p>
<p>The fact that mental laborers are despised by the world is just what one expects. In fact, the suffering and sorrow bestowed upon literati by this volatile era is truly too much. Since one cannot survive by walking this path, should one give up and change careers? In this society with more people than opportunities, it is not easy to find a job, so one has to continue to make a living by selling one's blood and brains, while struggling and panting under the heavy pressure of poverty and sorrow. The cruelty and coldness of society towards literati is already terrifying enough, and now there is news of new books being sold by the catty. I wonder what the writers who make a living by writing think of this event that is worth crying about. The decline of the market is becoming more and more serious day by day. In the future, it is difficult to predict what kind of situation it will become. Perhaps even more tragic encounters will follow one after another. At that time, a group of people who live by writing will have to wait for death.</p>

<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>Random Notes on Returning Home</p>
<p>Not the mother's son, but the grandmother's grandson.</p>
<p>After running to Shanghai on a forgotten day, and through the desperate efforts of two people, we tore through five sets of calendars amidst illness and poverty. Last year, my wife's pregnancy shattered the position of a primary school teacher earning twenty-eight dollars a month. Adding insult to injury, I suffered from a long illness. So, as the child was about to be born, I reluctantly wrote home, like a bell-ringing monk, to ask for some money. The reply was the expected disappointment. Nevertheless, the child was naturally born into this sinful world. A simple letter: "On such and such date, at such and such time, a boy was born, mother and child are safe," sent by registered mail. Unexpectedly, a return letter arrived, talking about the child and such, mostly suitable for childcare tips, and finally saying to bring him back to see her, the grandmother, after the first month. As usual, he should naturally be brought back so that I could add some glory to the child’s face. Although he might not be a true emperor in the future, the firstborn boy in the hometown is still considered a joyous occasion. However, for me, with wasted opportunities to earn money and additional expenses like travel costs, it would be a loss to just go back for a "look." So, I made excuses about "bodily discomfort" and used the blind man's trick of "not traveling" to get by.</p>
<p>At the end of the lunar year, an unexpected letter arrived again: "Come back with the child for the New Year's greetings, no matter what!" This was an order, with the serious implication of "disobedience will be punished severely." So, I had no choice but to hold the child and "go down to Jiangnan."</p>
<p>Stepping onto the soil of my hometown from the train station, it seemed like I was familiar with everyone, yet they were all strangers. Rickshaws pulled along the road, and I saw many "small feet enlarged feet" style modern foreign houses. My hometown seemed no longer mine. "Ah! Five years!" I sighed softly, walking home as if in a dream.</p>
<p>Five old trees stood tall in front of the door. They recognized me. A gust of wind passed, and they called out in unison, "Home!" Yes, "Home!" I looked up at the dilapidated old house, half-supported by two thick wooden props, its fate probably sealed. "Home! Home, separated for five years!"</p>
<p>The rickshaw stopped at the door. An elderly woman looked at us as if we were foreigners. I recognized her; she was the old servant of my grandmother, so loyal, just like the old servants in old novels. But she could only guard the dilapidated house and couldn't perform a story of saving the young master. I called her name, and she squinted her eyes and ran out the door. "Really, the young master and mistress are back, hahaha, young master!" She forgot her age and snatched the child from my wife's arms. Holding him in her arms, she said, "Oh, how heavy! Wu Ma is useless!" The next sentence was almost to herself. However, she sighed and happily ran inside to announce the news.</p>
<p>My mother stood in the main room, smiling as she held her grandson. Wu Ma bustled about as if many guests had arrived at the house, busying herself with this and that. Although she couldn't save the young master, she was indeed loyal to him. Poor old woman!</p>
<p>Before "bring the child back" in the letter, it was "New Year's greetings," which was also a major event. I seemed to have forgotten that a son had a set of rituals for his mother. My wife reminded me so as not to fail in my duty.</p>
<p>The child cried. My wife took him from my mother's arms. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law stood together, and I found my wife surprisingly old. It is said that women age easily after giving birth. My mother had two sons, although the current son was not hers. In terms of age and childbirth, my mother shouldn't be so young compared to my wife. My wife's aging seemed mythical. A twenty-two-year-old young woman!</p>
<p>My eyelids heavy with shame, I ran to the hall to look at my father's portrait. He was also young. My hand naturally reached down to my chin, and the prickly stubble told me that I had exceeded my father's age. At this moment, I lost consciousness, not knowing how long I stayed there, until my mother woke me up. She asked what I was doing in the hall. I casually replied, "Looking at the flowers I planted."</p>
<p>"They all died long ago," she said, her voice raised particularly high.</p>
<p>"Fool!" I scolded myself. Five years! A few small flowers and plants, subjected to natural destruction and without human protection, how could they not die? Just like people, a twenty-four-year-old youth!</p>
<p>I hysterically ran outside alone.</p>
<p>Returning for dinner under the kerosene lamp, my wife and I sat facing each other. My mother held her grandson, standing at the head of the table. Suddenly, the child cried, and my mother, talking about the child and such, tried to coax him with childcare tips. But the true emperor was extraordinary; he waved his little fists and kept crying.</p>
<p>"Recognizing his mother?" The experienced mother didn't trust that her methods would completely fail.</p>
<p>My wife put down her rice bowl and took the child. He waved his little fists and smiled.</p>
<p>"Recognizing his mother?" I said.</p>
<p>My wife smiled, so content, something I hadn't seen since we got married.</p>
<p>There was no sound at the head of the table. I lowered my head to eat, pushing each grain of rice into my mouth.</p>

<h3 id="e252">Fear of Death and Suicide <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Jue</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper, news of suicides meets the eye every day. Every time I see this kind of news, I always feel that this is an act that should not be done. At the same time, there are some people who vigorously praise the courage of those who commit suicide and ridicule my attitude as being afraid of death. I myself dare not admit that I have the courage to commit suicide, but to say that I am afraid of death, I absolutely cannot admit. The general view is that suicide and fear of death are two relative terms. Those who commit suicide are not afraid of death, and those who fear death will not commit suicide. There is absolutely no contradiction in my thinking like this. In fact, both death and life have their true meanings. I would like to use a corner of this column to propose a discussion in order to explore what our attitude should be.</p>
<p>We must know that we do not meet death. When death comes, the person no longer exists. When the person exists, there is no death. We cannot find the word "death" in our dictionary, because when we die, our dictionary will also be destroyed along with us. Therefore, the saying "fear of death," when boiled down, really carries a bit of a ridiculous meaning! I have heard a story: A fortune teller made a bet with someone, saying that the world would be completely destroyed in ten years. That person did not believe it, saying that it would absolutely not happen. The two sides could not agree, so they bet a thousand dollars. Later, someone asked him, where did you get so much money to bet with people? What if you lose? The person smiled and said, if the world is really destroyed, there will be neither him nor me, so how can there be a loss! Although this is a joke, carefully considering its meaning can make us understand what the relationship between man and flowers really is. Therefore, the meaning of the word "death" is only the moment when we humans leave this world. Its relationship with life is sudden. When death comes, a person's senses are immediately cut off. We ourselves can never experience what death is like. So, if a person cannot experience death, then what is there to be afraid of! At the same time, the process of life may be full of reefs, which often makes us feel difficulties in moving forward. Because we are unwilling to fight with difficulties, we then resort to self-destruction in order to escape this society, out of sight, out of mind. But this is only a temporary emotional distortion. In fact, since we were born into this world and nurtured by our parents and society, having grown into a person, we have no choice but to be a person and should never abandon their responsibilities, which is a sin. As for saying that environmental difficulties cannot be resolved, I dare not agree. The reason is not that the difficulties cannot be resolved, but that he himself is unwilling to continue to fight with the difficulties. Suicide is fundamentally an act of the weak, which, except for those who worship death, cannot arouse people's sympathy. Its errors do not need to be discussed in many pages, and the matter is clearly placed before us.</p>
<p>In short, fear of death is certainly not good, and the history of suicide should not be. We only have to grasp reality, because the past is counted. We absolutely do not know the future, only reality can we grasp. Strutting forward, this is what a good man should do.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Illegally Felled Ancient Cypress Trees <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Qiqi</p>
<p>Reported in the news: "Beiping (Beijing) Telegram: The Ancient Relics Preservation Committee discovered illegal felling of cypress trees. In addition to the Temple of Heaven and the Altar of Agriculture, there are also a total of one hundred and three trees in the Altar of the Sun and the Altar of the Earth that are either insect-infested or withered. Also, there are many trees in the Imperial Academy that have been marked for felling, and the prices quoted by the Tan Ji Quan Lumber Factory are different. The committee has telegraphed the Ministry of Interior for thorough investigation. Public opinion is paying more attention to this matter. A newspaper commented that the Ministry of Interior should bear full responsibility, because the felling was done by people sent by the Ministry of Interior. If the trees have insects, they can be exterminated, there is no reason to destroy them completely." After reading this piece of news, we feel that it is indeed news.</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th Incident," the ancient relics of Beiping were moved south. The meaning is that ancient relics are precious treasures and cannot be lost along with the possible loss of Beiping. Therefore, they were moved south to be preserved in the Shanghai Concession, which is very fortunate (although it is known that some were lost on the long journey south from Beiping by boat (?), but most of them are safe and complete). Now that Beiping is under the watchful eyes of a strong neighbor, no one dares to predict what will happen in the future. In addition to ancient relics and antiques, ancient cypress trees in Beiping are also valuable. If the cypress trees are not moved south, there should be a proper way to deal with them. The Ministry of Interior sent people to cut down the ancient cypress trees. Although the intention has not been announced, it is obviously for the sake of preserving the national culture that the cypress trees are cut down and moved south. The public opinion in Beiping is truly short-sighted and has no foresight. Can't they even think of this reason? And a certain newspaper is even more strange, clearly recording that it was the Ministry of Interior that sent people to cut down the trees, but it is titled "Illegally Felled," and the article also says "because the felling was done by people sent by the Ministry of Interior," etc. This is simply lawless! The "illegal fellers" are criminals, how can they be directly called "sent by the Ministry of Interior?" If you want to say that they were sent by the Ministry of Interior, you should at least say that the fellers cannot be labeled as criminals. Chinese people are most likely to make a fuss over trifles, especially most likely to shout loudly over small matters. The illegal felling of ancient cypress trees is thousands of miles away from the loss of national territory. What's so great about the illegal felling of ancient cypress trees, especially when the illegal fellers were sent by the government? Moreover, the meaning of the illegal felling of ancient cypress trees is clearly the same as that of ancient relics, to be moved south to ensure their eternal preservation?</p>

<p>Getting off the No. 5 tram every day and buying a Da Wan Evening News from a woman has become a habit. A friend asked me why I don't subscribe to one and have it delivered to my little apartment. I shook my head; in fact, I had no reason to answer.</p>
<p>Today, I took the newspaper from the old woman's hand. She exceptionally asked for six copper coins instead of the usual four. I asked her if the price had increased. She smiled and said, "Today is the lottery drawing."</p>
<p>So, the price increase is due to the lottery drawing. These two things linked together are indeed a "problem."</p>
<p>I regret not accepting my friend's advice. On the day of each aviation lottery drawing, I will lose two more copper coins. If it returns to the period when lotteries were prevalent, no matter how lazy I am, I will definitely take a rickshaw to the newspaper office to subscribe to one. The rickshaw fare can probably be produced anyway.</p>

<p>"Gu Gang won!" I shouted. "No," Meng Tefulan smiled and said, "Laweilou won." I was angry that he opposed me like this, but he continued to smile and oppose me; as a result, we made a bet. Finally, after half an hour of heartbeat and unease, I realized that Gu Gang had lied to me, I lost, and Meng Tefulan won, think about it! I told him that I would pay him immediately; he bowed to me and said not to be in such a hurry. Afterwards, I met him in Qi Ya Jia and gave him a questioning look. He smiled mysteriously and bowed to me. Meeting in the theater was the same, and it was the same no matter where I met him. I became very curious. Robert is handsome and twenty-six years old. So, this morning, Robert's father, my future father-in-law, and mother discussed for two hours.</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>"Is this a sign that you are listening carefully to me?" Oh, I know he has visited Yang Nait. Marriage is arranged like this. One major thing has not yet been decided: when should I go to the town hall, should I wear a gray dress, or a brown dress? Should I wear a hat with ribbons or no ribbons?"</p>
<p>"How far are you going to go with this madness!"</p>
<p>"Madness? Of course, there is no obstacle at all. Robert and I will love each other madly, and our parents are also satisfied — —"</p>
<p>"Are you willing to marry someone like this?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean by "like this"? The meaning of this sentence is too vague."</p>
<p>"Marry him without understanding him or loving him?"</p>
<p>"But I really understand him. I have seen him on the racetrack and on the road. I adore him! I didn't have a snack the day before yesterday because I didn't see him, and I didn't even drink three cups of coffee. I really wanted to commit suicide." "But what about him?"</p>
<p>"He is willing to marry me, so he loves me!" Lulu answered triumphantly. But when she saw the paleness on Sophia's face, she regretted that she shouldn't have said that, so she leaned towards her sister and asked affectionately:</p>
<p>"Did I say something that offended you?"</p>
<p>"No, dear, no; you are right. A person loves, and a person marries. It is difficult to awaken love," so she sighed softly.</p>
<p>"Awakening love, awakening love!" Lulu said repeatedly in a frantic manner. "It's easy, Sophia; but if a person has such a solemn look like you, melancholy eyes, and a face that doesn't smile, if a person walks and thinks, and sits in the corner and thinks, while others are dancing and making noise, if a person only reads and doesn't laugh, he is not living but falling in love, but naturally he has developed a good</p>
