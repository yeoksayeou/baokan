<p>（東京）日本現取銷四月十七日對華政策聲明中所處之立塲、日本之出此、是否因此驚人之聲明引起全世界之反響之故、今猶未悉、外相廣田現以爲四月十七日之聲明並未「正式存在」此項聲明乃由外務省省發表、而具非正式性質、廣田已以此節通告外交界、並聲明日本關於遠東之政策可以四月二十日外務省發言人所發之第二次聲明所載、「吾人人願中國之統一與肇榮、蓋知日本在地域上所處地位、設中國統一而繁榮、則日本可獲劉易增加之利益、惟中國之統一與繁榮必由中國之覺悟與中國自已之努力得之」數言槪括之、聞日政府已依此意旨於星期四晚以書面答覆英美駐日大使矣、至於四月二十日外務省發言人第二次聲明中所接稱、「非其他列强自稱開拓所能得之、要知其他列强或國聯運用其勢力、略取中國以自利之時代、今已過去矣」數言、未列入星期四晚書面答覆中國、殆已不復槪括日本之政策矣、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）自日本外相廣田向英國駐日大使林德萊解釋對華宣言後、英政府今日認事件現已告結束、今日午後官方向報界正式表示、西門外相將於星期一日在衆院宣布政府已認此爲「無事自擾」、而對廣田外相關於四月十七日聲明書之解釋、認爲完全滿意接受、外交界信美國政府對此與英抱同一見解、旋據此間半官方面稱、「外相西門於星期一日在衆院發表宣言後、將不致再有其他行動」、（二十八日國民電）</p>

<p>（東京）英國西門外長因恐目下開會中之英議會、詢問日本外務省之所謂非正式聲明之眞意、曾命駐日大使林德萊訪問廣田外相、凖備在議會答辯、一切已詳前電、西門外長在議會報告林大使與廣田外相之會談内容、請東京亦於同時公佈、因此日帝國政府亦定於三十發表、俾一掃英美及世界各國之誤解、至該會談内容、大體如下、</p>

<p>本且希望中國之門户開放、（三）毫無阻碍他國公正對華通商之意、（四）認定何國係擾中國之秩序事至難答復、祇有問諸現供給中國武器者之良心、日本對於點火於隣屋、終不能袖手傍觀、</p>
<p>又二十六日晚、由外務省傳達英大使林德萊與美大使葛羅之英譯聲明要旨、亦與該會談内容同樣發表云、（二十八日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）駐日英國大使林德列氏爲告老辭官計、已於二十八日午後一時四十分由東京車站出發、外務省幹部人員及其他多數人士均聯袂至站歡送、該大使訂於本日三時由横濱乘亞細亞皇后號、當經由加拿大歸國、在繼任駐日大使未到任以前、聞將由參事官特德氏暫代其職務云、（二十八日日聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）聞外相西門將於星期一日在下院詳細陳述日本所發「對華不許染指」之聲明事、並將以駐東京英大使林德萊、報告與日外相廣田談話情形之電文提交下院、並將提出林大使於美大使葛魯收到關於此事之日本正式宣言後數小時廣田外相所授與之公文一件、日本致美之正式宣言、中有數點、與外務省發言人原作之宣言不同、目下倫敦未有工英政府對於此案將續作舉動之徵象、（二十八日路透社電）</p>

<p>（東京）美國大使葛魯關於日本非公式聲明問題、前訪廣田外相、要求提示此非公式聲明之正式英譯文、廣田外相答以此係非公式談話、當與天羽情報部長接洽、作成正式譯文、茲外務省已將此項譯文於昨日送交美大使館、（二十八日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）美國駐日大使葛魯二十六日訪問廣田上相時、請要日外務省日前發表對華政策聲明書之英譯文、外相與首腦部恊議之結果、將該聲明内容以英文說明頗詳、作成文書、卽於下午六時派事務官赴美使館手交與大使、其内容主要部分如次、</p>
<p>（一）日本爲東亞和平之安定力、負担維持東亞和平之全責任、今次非公式聲明、不外於將日政府政策向全世界宣明者、</p>
<p>（二）中國如建成其統一與繁榮之目的、則日本因地理的關係、亦受其利益、故日政府毫無干涉中國獨立權之意圖、然中國之統一、須要中國本身之覺醒與努力、决不能以他國利已的權取建成之、</p>
<p>（三）日本政府並無意圖干涉第三國在中國之權益、如第三國以中國人利益爲主、與中國從事通商貿易、則日政府亦頗歡迎如此第三國之活動、</p>
<p>（四）日本政府並無背馳中國户開放與機會均等主義及現行條約之意圖、　　　　（五）然日政府如見第三國實行搗亂東亞和平及秩序之行動、則不問其形式或理由如何、斷然反對之、</p>
<p>（六）日政府希望列國承認「滿洲國」之公正自由行動、但日本對於「滿洲國」並無領土的野心、</p>

<p>（東京）有吉公使於今日下午與廣田外相會見後、對記者之談話如下、此次歸國别無要事、南昌會議亦係照例行事、並無若會議性質、國聯之對華援助、實際係在調查、尙未具體化、國聯欲如何爲之、豈不甚佳、惟其經由國聯之國際資本貸欵中國、因日本旣已退出國聯、則成爲除日本外之國際共管中國、故絶對反對、若列國各别合法援助、開發產業、固不妨事、至於供給武器、因蔣介石討伐共匪、武器或亦必要、其他若列國之經濟援助及軍事援助、亦僅係謠傳、雖亦有眞實者、但不可神經過敏、總之、中日關係之轉好、可斷言也云、（二十八日電通電）</p>

<h3 id="c17">日本立塲何嘗取消？廷 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>昨日路透社東京電訊。謂「日本現取銷四月十七日對華政策聲明中所處之立塲。」「外相廣田現以爲四月十七日之聲明並未正式存在」云云驟視之。一若日本果因世界輿論力强度之鞭撻。而表示軟化。實則在軍閥勢力把持下之東京政府。在未受嚴重的物質打擊之前。安敢直截爽快。自認屈服且證諸旣往日本外交之老謀深算。及十七日聲明書涵義之重大。該項聲明書之提出。决非爲操切將事之舉動。自可斷言。由是而類推國際反響之來。實早在日人洞鑒中。而其預謀應付之方針。亦必經擘劃周詳無疑。故取消立塲之說。於其謂出乎日人之軟化。毌寗以日人旣定之一步驟目之。如是則知吾人對之不僅不能據以自喜。且當引爲深戒。蓋日人處心積慮恊以謀我者。數十年如一日。每當其對華政策形似寛弛之會。卽爲其侵略方案積極凖備之時。欲擒故縱。以退爲進。彼固優爲之也。</p>
<p>今試詢諸任何稍知遠東時局之人曰。日本果肯幡然覺悟。改絃更張。一本眞正友誼之精神。而與中國相往還乎。其答語將必曰否。故謂以最近廣田取消立塲」之聲明。卽能抹去此十餘日來在世人心目中刻劃宛然之痕跡。其誰信之。且正惟此痕跡之不能輕輕抹去。彼方發表聲明書之初步使命。便　算達到。良以該項聲明書之對象。在反對國際援助中國之技術或金融全作。其樹敵形式。固爲多方面的。然必謂日人將仗其現有之力量。更進一步。而向各方施以直接壓迫之行動。則亦未必。人非喪心病狂。决不願到處肉搏挑戰。而自處於必敗地位。而况以日人之狡猾。安肯出此。由此推論。乃知國聯縱與中國繼續進行技術合作。日人能直接以壓力加諸國聯者。當有限度。以毫無武力之國聯猶然。擁有强大軍備之英美。更不待論。今始舉一事爲例。日本反對美國飛機輸入中國。騰口說。尙無不可。但若逕以軍艦封鎖中國港岸。勿使進口。甚至半途截留。强硬提取。則勢非釀成戰爭不止。此豈日人所願貿然從事者。故十七日之聲明。無非欲使國聯英美等國多加一層愼重將事之顧慮同時對於我國。則爲一異常嚴重之警告。國聯與英美等國。固不必畏懼日本之直接壓迫。惟因此而增益之顧慮。則决不能因廣田「取消立塲」之聲明。而渙然冰釋。至於我國所受之威脅。則有隨時實現之可能。日本僅須出以旁敲側擊之手段。强我國關閉門户。勿與國聯英美來往。而自居於第三者不負責任之地位。歐美列强。苟有煩言。當惟中國是問。與彼無涉。此爲日本實行其聲明之必採方針。將使列强不能藉條約以阻止。我國無從假外援而反抗。　　由此分析。可知日本外務省十七日聲書中所取之立塲。固有其維持與推進之方法。必不至有所取消。其存在之爲正式或非正式。又何嘗有所分别。我國誠欲貫澈反抗强權之宗旨。自當抱熱烈犧牲之决心。齩牙切齒。以圖最後之一拼。終不能因廣田今日一言而興奮。明日一言而沮喪。至聰明如英美各國。自亦不應徒受廣田烟幕彈之蒙蔽。而抱得遇且過之態度也。</p>

<p>歐洲政局顯生變化法國覇權次第動搖歐洲大陸的經濟問題、除開法蘭西是比較穩定、荷比等幾個國有點辦法之外、其他都在經濟恐慌狂潮激盪之中、特别是德國和奥匈多腦河流域諸國、更是震動得厲害、從前曾經在法國指導下在倫敦開過四國會議、其他如洛桑會議·如斯特勒薩會議·都是要圖解决多腦河諸國的經濟問題、但始終沒有什麽效果、反而使問題越見複雜、解决越沒有途徑了、</p>
<p>在這種混沌局面中、德意志的經濟情形、誠然每况愈下、已至瀕於敗壞的危境、但是他的政治調子、依舊倡得很高、反凡爾賽和平條約、要求軍備平等····等等、同時盡力煽起德國人的愛國熱情、一力想自形成一個系統、這個系統是以日爾曼民族爲中心、當然想進而平分歐洲的覇權、</p>
<p>意大利在這時候、正是向上發展得有力的國家、同時與法國在歐洲·在地中海·在北菲·都形成對立之勢、她帮助德國、但不願德國太强、所以她乘這個時候、——德國實力未充的時候、第一使奥大利脫離德國的掌握、第二使奥匈都傾向於意大利的領道、結果這個醖釀成功了、三月十二日·匈牙利首相貢巴斯到了羅馬、同月十三日·奥大利的獨裁總理杜爾斐斯也到了、他們兩位與意國墨索里尼、十四日會議於羅馬的維勒奇亞宫殿、這時候墨索里尼的態度、非常機巧、在恊議時、差不多擱下了政治問題不談、而專着力於經濟、到了十六日會議、就得了成果、十七日卽發布他們的議定書、其第一議定書、是三國的政治聲明、其中有「·····三國間以現存的各種條約與友好關係爲凖據的目的、對一切的問題、尤其是與三國有利害關係的各種問題、或並通問題、都必期其恊調·····以促進三國間有效的恊力爲目的·····」還有其他的兩通議定書、是關於經濟問題的、其内容有「·······確立意大利與其他兩國間的現行通商條約的擴張、對奥大利的工業品、給予特惠制度、意大利與奥國的工業、基於榖物價格低落、要取彼此諒解、克服匈牙利的困難的手段、並通過亞得利亞海諸港（卽埠姆與特里斯特）、規定了如何促進貨物的輸運·····」</p>
<p>這種恊定在政治上的影響、一方面是使德國合併奥大利的計劃完全打破、對凡爾賽和約與地里安條約·聖傑門條約·都有破棄或修改的意趣、這是對於歐洲政局前途有嚴重關係聯的、其他一方面在經濟上、奥國從前惟有向漢堡向布勒門經德國境内出口、雖然道程比較遠些、却也沒有法子、現在意大利旣對他們開放了亞得利亞海的通航權、而且埠姆與特里斯特·正是奥匈兩國所急欲得到的海口、這是意大利樹立中歐經濟覇權的基礎工作、是中歐糾紛的序幕、再次是意·奥·匈三國、並不曾關閉大門、並且還有意拉攏多腦河流域諸國加入他們這個組織、如果這事眞能形成的話、則小恊約國將傾向於意大利、法國的歐洲覇權、當然遭受打擊、卽於德意志也有很大的不利、阻止她的發展、</p>
<p>這次的恊定、照已經公布的公文看、似乎對於過去的一切國際條約、不但沒有破壞的意思、而且還要想維持、不過、這究竟是一種外交上的應酬、實際上還是盡量發揮自己的敏妙手腕、打破歡洲的現狀、特别是國際聯盟受着這種拆台的威脅、旣不能使意大利以及多腦河流域諸國忠實於國聯、履行國際的合作、又不能發揚國聯的權能平服歐洲各小國的不平、所以德意兩國各國運用其外交手段、拉攏小國作衛星、換言之、就是要抛棄國際會議的形式、轉而入於縱横裨闔的爭鬭了、（三月十九日於巴黎）</p>

<p>自本月十七日、日本外務省發表關於中日關係非正式言論後、引起國際間極大之反響、我政府亦已兩次發表聲明駁斥、最近國際問題研究會、對日本聲明發表意見如次、</p>
<p>欲獨呑中國本月十七日、日本外務省發表對華聲明、儼然以東亞唯一之保護者自居、而視我國不啻爲其附庸、舉凡國際與我合作事項、縱屬技術性質而毫無政治意味者、亦槪遭反對、日本聲明書中、認爲「滿洲與上海事變之後、外國所擔任之任何聯合行動、縱然以技術或金融援助之名義、當然含有政治意味、·····</p>
<p>在原則上、必反對如上述之擔任、」今日日本硬指「技術或金融合作、當然含有政治意味、」固無論此種發言、有越俎代庖、干涉鄰邦内政之嫌、而其强横之態度、實充滿政治的作用、蓋日本藉口不欲列强共管中國、而欲獨自呑滅中國也、</p>
<p>野心無已時前此日本之所大言不慚者、惟曰東三省爲其特殊的勢力範圍而已、自「九一八」後、恃其窮兵黷武的殘暴手段、攫奪我東北、乃竟不知饜足、妄欲獨覇東亞、以遂其東亞門羅主義之私、今日聲明欲「履行其在東亞之特殊責任」、他日何嘗不可進而狂言履行其在太平洋之責任、甚至全世界之責任乎、</p>
<p>超過廿一條查日本外務省此次之聲明、實代表其軍國主義之野心、方歐戰爆發之初、歐美列强無暇東顧、日本認爲良機難得、遂對我提出二十一條要求、今日國際情勢之危機、確似歐戰爆發之前夜、而日本此次聲明書之内容、亦卽重申民四要求之精神、二十一條中最足駭人聽聞者、厥爲「第五項」要求、其目的在包辦中國之軍事國防、與今日聲明書所謂「至於以軍用飛機供給中國、在中國建造飛行塲、及派遣軍事訓練官、或軍事顧問前往中國、或承募借欵供給政治用途之經費、則顯然可····擾亂東亞之和平秩序、凡此舉動、日本將反對之、」等語、不僅先後一轍、抑且超過二十一條之强硬要求、蓋當時主張由日本包辦中國之軍事國防、今則强制列强不得與中國合作、其言雖有消極積極之分、而其目的則一、</p>
<p>荒謬復矛盾夫國防建設、爲一獨立國家應有之權利、非他國所能干涉、日本軍隊可以盤踞隣邦土地、凖備攻勢與侵略的軍事行動、而中國獨不能自覺的在本國領土從事於守勢的與自衛的國防建設、鵲巢鳩居、喧賓奪主、凡有血氣之民族、能不髮指、日本聲明書中又云、「中國之統一、中國土地完整之保持、及中國境内秩序之恢復、皆爲日本所切望者、」讀之令人費解、日本其已忘不久以前曾以武力破壞中國領土之完整、攫我東北四省、盤踞迄今乎、</p>

<p>大公社云、自日本廣田外相爲反對國聯對中國之技術合作、發表非正式之聲明後、世界各國、莫不指日本此舉爲狂悖、並將聯合一致對付日本、并指日本此舉、不特破壞九國公約、抑且破壞世界國際之和平、日本鑒於國際間之感情日趨惡劣、爰由日使館情報局代表岩井英一發表聲明式之談話、强詞奪理、希圖淆亂世界聽聞、茲爲誌之如下、</p>
<h3 id="c141">反對國聯對華投資 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>據岩井英一談、國聯如以純正之態度向中國投資、同時保守機會均等門户開放之原則、則日本方面、當然予以同情、但目前國聯向中國投資、實係轉用於軍事政治者、此舉實足以促成中國之内亂、日本有維持東亞和平之責任、是不得不加以反對、</p>
<h3 id="c142">聲明廣田宣言意旨 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>至日本之意旨、卽係希望中國能達到和平統一</p>
<p>之目的、以期中日共存共榮、但中國態度則反是、故廣田外相、特發表非正式之聲明、以警告國聯、但不幸以聲明中稍有未曾注意之數點、致引起各國之誤會、故今日特再發表談話以解釋云、</p>
<h3 id="c143">反指中國態度不合 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>岸井繼譯、中國竟乘此機會、放棄往昔親日之論調、策動排日空氣、煽動世界各國反日、同時由外交部訓令駐美英二公使、分向英美二國接洽、以促成英美之全作、并於五月十五日、在英或美召集九國簽約國會會議、以壓迫日本、此舉殊爲不合、</p>

<p>將來如發生任何問題、則此種責任、應由中國負之云、</p>

有「勞働季刋」出版，便馬上購來閱讀。費了一天的功夫，終算把這本刋物讀完了。在我看來，這本刋物倒是比較進步的東西，内容也還充實，不過我讀該雜誌第一篇文字—勞働問題之理論的基礎裏，有一段說行進資本國對於殖民地勞働的剝削，却有點懷疑，現在引該文一段如下：　　「····不過他們在殖民地的加强榨取的過程中，又創造出反抗其自身的條件—勞働階級的成長和一般文化水平的提高，至於那作爲其工具的殖民地民族資本家，他們由於資本力的脆弱和又受他人榨取的關係下，乃亦只有轉而對勞働者實行過量的榨取以爲彌補·····」　　照上面的那種說法，似乎是祗有勞働階級纔提出反抗的口號，而民族資本家反而作爲先進資本國的工具，這是什麽理由呢？其次，民族資本家旣須實行「過量的榨取」，如何在該雜誌上「ＸＸ工人運動的回顧和意義一一文理又說：　　「····工人的罷工鬥爭，民族的勞資鬥爭往往熱烈於普通的勞資鬥爭。工人們對於外國資本家的反抗時常採取同盟罷工的手段，而對於本國資本家的反抗比較緩和····」　　離道勞働者廿甘於受「本國資本家的榨取麽」？擬或是本國資本家榨取程度要較外國資本家緩和些呢？就最近的事實看來，最近發生的罷工，又足以證明本國的資本家榨取程度實不亞於外國資本家。　　從此次罷工中，我們又看出此次的工潮，帝國主義者實與本國資本家是一致的，是互相勾結的，但該雜誌中對於目前的勞働運動的動向，却沒有提及。　　此外，在該雜誌二二一頁上篇文字的末一段裏，却說「工運，不唯漸次消沉，而且走上了澈底破產的道路」我認爲這也是不對的，根據最近勞資對立的情勢，不但不能說「工運」將「澈底破產」，我們反可以預言，工運的前途現在正漸進的發展呢！　　先生，我們對於勞働問題的動因，和工運的前途，實在有澈底了解的必要，上列幾個疑問，務必請你逐一答覆。　　——汪一中來信——　　關於勞働問題的來信不僅汪君一封，但要以汪君的信爲充滿着研究的態度，所以我們特地把汪君的信提出，但附帶也回答一切對勞働問題研究有所質疑的諸君。關於民族資本家變爲先進資本主義國家的工具，以及帝國主義的榨取殖民地，何以單祗激發勞働階級出來反抗，這個問題，本部的接到的李又南君關於印度革命的一封來信，對於這一點的剖析頗可作爲參考，現在就摘錄一段，以供汪君參考。李君說：　　「·····照理說，帝國主義的侵略殖民地，殖民地的整個民族都是感到切身痛苦的；殖民地的民族資本家，勞働階級，農民，都被帝國主義者的鎖鍊套住頭頸，不能自由發展。因此，殖民地的反帝運動應當是整個的民族革命運動。換句話說，反帝運動不是單一階級的特殊任務，而是各階級聯合戰綫的抗爭。因此，印度的革命運動在理論上是表現了這個動向。但是各階級相互間的鬥爭是絶對的，永久的，而這種對立的統一則爲相對的，暫時的。所以各階級的共同抗爭運動，在發展過程中，由於絶對的矛看之逐漸尖銳化，必然的會把這種相對的同一壓住。印度的民族資本家，一方面雖相解　帝國主義的束　，但另一方面，因着工農的要求，不單是要澈底反帝，解除帝國主義者套在整個民族上的鎖鍊，同時還要謀自己生活的解放，消滅社會上内在的矛盾，這一來，工農的要求與民族資本家是根本的衝突了。因此，在反帝上在反封建殘餘上，兩者的利益固是一致，在這一點郤使兩者，决計不能合作，必然的會產生裂痕。因爲民族資本家在帝國主義掌握之下，不過是不能向前發展，郤也不至於一會兒就滅亡，他們還可以充人家的買辦，苟安圖存。他們在這樣權衡的兩者間的輕重下，反帝的情緖自然沒有了。他反轉而作帝國主義的淸道夫，鎭壓本國暴民的叛亂」　　這一段話，似乎頗可證明民族資本家所以要變成先進資本主義國家工具的由來及帝國主義與民族資本家利益相互誘透的由來。這種殖民地反帝運動的，外力的矛盾，通過於社會内在的鬥爭過程中，更開展了勞働階級反抗的决心。他們現在已認識了反帝運動與爭取切身利益的要求是同一任務的兩方面。汪君來信所引的該刋物的那一段文字，雖指出了因爲帝國主義加緊榨取是創造出了反抗其自身的條件，却忽略了這種反抗的加强是基於社會内在矛盾發展之原故，及對於外力的抗爭惟有在通過内夜發展過程中　能　大起來。（未完）</p>

是我們所以貧弱不能富國强兵的最大原因、爲什麽全國各種事業不能進步發達呢、這就因爲我們從事於各種事業的人、沒有相當學問、或者他的智識不成熟、他的學問智識不成熟、怎樣的發達他所從事的事業、進而求其進步和成功呢、所以我們做一件事、如無學問智識、或學問智識不充足、馬馬虎虎糊里糊塗做事、這個事業、必定不能發達進步、並且一定要失敗的、反之、如有充分的學問智識並有把握的來經營一椿事業、這椿事業、一定可以得到成功、失敗是例外的、所以我們看全國各種事業、都不能有長足的進步、或者不能澈底成功、就是因爲從事於各種事業的人、學問智識不充足或者甚至於沒有學問智識、所以說、學問是全國各種事業中的中心事業、因爲有了學問、才知道如何做人、如何做事、什麽才是學問呢、學問就是智識能力經騐、可是學問又從什麽地方得來的呢、什麽地方造就的呢、家庭裏、學校裏、社會裏、以及自修、在家庭裏、你們靠你們父母長輩來扶植你們、在學校裏你們要靠你們的師長來敎育你們、在社會裏、更有許許多多的事情可以增長你們的學問和經騐、同時除了家庭學校社會以來、最要緊的、就是自修自修功夫做到了，一人的學問才可以成熟、那樣、你們將來畢業以後、到社會上來做事、才有把握、才知道如何做人如何做事、</p>

<p>春秋兒童週刋要利用萬能的手  芷園　　人爲萬物之靈，是一句古語，人的靈巧，雖說是腦的作用，還要靠着手，纔能夠做得出來，手的最大功用，就是能夠利用火的緣故，所以衣，食，住行上有種種幸福享受。不過習之旣久，不覺得罷了！禽獸沒有手，也就不能近火，鳥類利用嘴，獸類利用爪，但若是近着火，嘴和爪都燒壞了，甚至蔓延到周身毛上，是要燒死的。因此禽獸一見那裏有火，個個都嚇得遠走高飛，還能說得上利用嗎？不過，鳥雖會飛，獸雖會走，靈巧的人類，把利用火的方法，對它放起槍來，終逃不了供人食用，一點沒有抵抗力，祇好任人犧牲了。我們有手不做事，不同禽獸一樣嗎？况且「弱肉强食，天演公理」，國難日亟，將來要受外人的宰割，是多麽危險氷如啊！續書有三種方法，呌作「心到口到手到」，生字是要用手記的，成語是要用手抄的，····一切等等，都要用手努力去做，也說不了許多。　　還有一層，我見過有些小朋友，無論什麽事情，雖是自己能做的事，都要喊着人家替他做，不是喊媽媽，就是傭僕，不肯自己去動手，這種懶惰習慣，也是要改去的。童年時代的墨索里尼  人偉　　墨索里尼是現在意大利的首相，是法西斯蒂的首領。他的父親名呌亞里達羅，是一個富有冒險性和暴動性質的人。墨索里尼强項的性質，多半是他父親遺傳下來的。童年時代的墨索里尼，是一個頑皮透項的小孩子。打架是他解决一切困難的唯一方法；流血在他不當一會什麽事，放學回家，往往弄得頭破血淋。有一次，他同羣兒去偷人家的西瓜吃，不料西瓜沒有吃完，却被一個吝嗇的老農看見了，便拿了木棍來追打。他們一看來勢洶湧，連忙㧞脚便逃。不料在這一刹那間，這一羣孩子裏，竟有一個跌傷了踝骨，墨索里尼聽見了哭聲，不忍同羣的孩子，被他人欺侮，便回過身來，搶步把這孩子拖在背上，再往前跑。這種見義勇爲，不肯放棄朋友的精神，在墨氏的兒童時代，已有這種美德，難怪他現在成爲世界政治舞臺上一個偉大的人物了。急救的常識  張郁明　　在前幾天，蘇州有一次失火，燒死兩個八九歲的小朋友，因爲這兩個小朋友，他們的家是住在樓上，可巧那一次起火，恰在樓下，等到這兩個小朋友覺察了有火，而想逃命的時候，那樓梯已經燒斷，不能由樓梯下去，可憐這兩個小朋友，活活的被燒死了！　　事後，附近某一個小學裏有一位敎師，將這一件可慘的新聞，取了做常識测騐的敎材，用來測騐他們學校裏的小朋友的急救常識。　　敎師的命題：假使你們是這兩個小朋友，當時遇到這樣情形，你們怎樣辦法？　　三個聰明小朋友的答案：　　（一）第一個小朋友說：我們可以找一條繩，用繩的一端擊在樓窗檻上，一端垂在樓下，我們可以從繩索上溜下去，就不致於跌傷了。　　（二）第二個小朋友說：依我就用一把洋傘，張開了傘，緊握着傘柄，一躍而下，如同飛機上所用的降落傘一樣，這是一個安全的好法子。　　（三）第三個小朋友說「溜繩」降落傘」皆是很好的法子，假使沒有繩索，沒有傘，便怎麽樣？我以爲人家樓上，總有床舗，床上總有被褥，假使人沒有繩索與傘發現的時候，就可以用棉被裏在身上跳下去，如此縱不免跌傷，不過總比活活的被燒死好得多吧！　　我以爲這一件新聞與這一個學校裏舉行的常識測騐，皆與我們小朋友很有益處，所以我特地寫出來，介紹一下。柳條  宿縣立十四小學校常少英　　春天的景緻多麽美妙！一切都好像在微笑！楊柳呀！你有那細長嬌柔的枝條，好似翠帶兒隨風飄搖；請你把春緊緊的擊住了吧！好讓我永遠地臥在春的懷抱！講故事　　姐姐呀！請你講個可愛的故事！當你的故事開始，我好像成了故事中的人物。　　或者做故事中的勇士，騎着馬遊行於中世紀的街市：請你趕快飛來這裏——假使  上海偉達小學程文錚　　假使我是一個兵士，我希望努力殺敵，我要使敵人不敢輕視我國，我要使中華民國雄視全球。假使我是一隻雄雞，我希望啼聲響亮，我要使人們早起，還要在草地上任意游戲。　　假使我是一隻鴿子，我希望非常美麗，我要替人家傳送書信，還要引人玩笑。假使我是一朶雲兒，我要駕着小船上天河，還要在天上飛行。　　假使我是一顆樹，我希望枝葉茂盛，我要開美麗的花，結甜蜜的果。京滬鐵路的自述  人　　我生在淸光緖三十四年，我的身體很長，頭在上海的閘北，尾梢在南京的下關，人家便把我頭尾兩處所在的地名，當做我的名字，稱做京滬鐵路。我的身長一九三英里，横貫蘇州，無錫，常州，丹陽，鎭江等地，每天火車在我的身上滾過，來回各五六次，每次費七八小時，來往旅客，很是擁擠，從國民政府建都南京以來，火車的重量，更增加了。　　我的工作很忙，終年不輟，可是我很高興做事，願替人們盡力。不過我最怕戰爭，當戰爭的時候，常常有軍隊擲炸彈謀害我，我受了傷便不能做工，火車不能行駛，因此交通斷絶。我眞不明白，因爲我很高興替人們做事，反而得到人們的謀害，我思量到這一點，使我萬分地傷心啊！黃金時代  閻重樓　　讀完了日裏的功課，照例四個孩子又聚在花園裏；這四個孩子一個是郁姊，一個是秉哥，一個是婉妹，一個是我。　　月亮剛才透出頭來，花影洒滿地上，風絲輕輕的吹，小草放着一種幽香。「我們今天晚上怎樣玩呢？」留着滿頭小辮子的婉妹問。　　「指天畫星星好嗎？」秉哥提議這種游戲。「不好，我不願意跳！」郁姊說。「那麽我們捉謎藏吧。」我的這個提議，她們都贊成了：於是我們便走到亭子裏去，我們要用亭子做我們游戲的範圍。　　從秉哥的腿上解下一條帶子，蒙在我的眼睛上，他們就東西的散開，並且呌喚着，但等我尋聲往捉的時候，却總是落了空；他們幾次還拉着我的衣裳。當他們給我蒙帶子的時候，我的鼻子故意高聳着，這樣我的眼睛上還可以留一線隙縫；但這秘密却沒有被他們發現。最後我就利用這點把婉妹捉住，於是婉妹代替了我的職務。婉妹因爲眼睛全蒙住下，並且跑不快，所以她總捉不到人，引得我們大笑。············這樣的一幕，離開現在已經十幾年了！現在，郁姊嫁給人家，秉哥是兩個孩子的父親？婉妹死了－我生活在他鄕！　　小朋友們呀：你們知道黃金時代的寳貴嗎？你們要及時讀書，游戲，不要「少小不努力，老大徒傷悲！」奇怪的植物  受社　　小朋友！動物吃植物那是誰都知道的；但是植物會有知覺，會吃動物，我想你大槪還沒有聽見過，現在讓我告訴你幾種奇怪的植物吧·一·含羞草這草是有知覺的·假使我們用手指觸它的葉子，它的葉子立刻會收縮了垂下來，但是隔了一會，那葉子仍舊慢慢的張開來了。　　二·茅膏菜這種植物有許多小而圓的葉子，葉子上又張着許多刺般的東西，在這許多刺的頭上，每個都生着一粒粒的小珠子，裏面藏着發亮的液體，假使昆蟲來飲這液體，它的足就被這液體黏住，無論如何掙扎不開的，這蟲死後，就被茅膏菜消化做食料了。　　三·捕蠅草它也有許多葉子，每張葉子都裂成兩片，在兩片的邊緣上，又各生着一排牙齒，當昆蟲停到這葉子上去時，那兩片葉子就迅速地合攏來，那兩面的牙齒也很快的互相交錯起來，於是蟲被它捉住了，就做了它的食料。　　小朋友！奇怪的植物很多呢，我下次再講給你聽吧。國旗的摺剪法  白鵝　　小朋，你不是在渴望自己能製造一面國旗嗎？現在讓我來告訴你一個簡便的摺剪方法。　　拿一張正方形的紙，最好是藍色的。將它對角摺疊，如甲圖，摺後得乙圖，再將它對摺，於是得丙圖，（丙丁兩回在摺法上雖然有兩方面，可是都是像回上虚線指示的一樣摺好了。）再將丙圖摺成三分，得丁圖，同樣將丁圖摺成二分，得戊圖，好啦，握摺好了。你拿把剪刀將戊圖上黑色的部分剪去，再放開來，你便可以得到像已圖一樣的旗子，不過在下面還須襯着一張白色的紙罷了。　　我還要告訴你，圖中的一，二，三四，······。是表示位置的，摺的時候應該正確才好。怎樣才是好學生  夏瀛　　—綸小朋友們一個標凖—（甲）　　（一）凖時起身和睡覺。（二）要帮助父母做事。（三）無故不肯缺課。（四）凖時刻到學校。（五）注意衣服身體的淸潔。（六）按時做掉敎師指定的工作。（七）不做無益的事，不看無益的書。（八）不忘帶課業用品。　　（乙）（一）趁電車要讓婦孺老幼者在先。（二）靠左邊走。（三）與人同行不高聲談話。（四）如遇尊長要立定行禮。（五）不沿途買東西吃。　　（丙）（一）愛惜公共的東西。（二）游戲時盡力游戲，上課時肅坐靜聽。（三）見果殻或紙屑就拾起。（四）遵守一切的規則，（五）服從同學間的勸告。　　（丁）　　（一）尊敬國黨旗及總理遺像。（二）唱國歌等要立起並脫帽。（三）靜守秩序。（四）沒有緊要事勿離開會塲。　　（戊）　　（一）不抄别人的功課，（二）鉛筆不入口。（三）不隨意抛棄紙屑。（四）肯發表。（五）答問發問必起立。　　（己）（一）盡力替全級或全校服務，（二）要練習適宜的運動。（三）要凖時歸家。（四）要自己去解决困難問題。春天的小玩具  丁合　　在這春天，沒有别的禮物送給諸位，只有幾種小玩具的製法奉告，算是我春天送給你們的禮物。　　做這幾種玩具，實在很便利，不要什麽工具，也不要什麽用錢買的材料，祇要諸位願意做，就可以做來玩的。麥笛　　做這個玩具，祇要有一桿綠的麥桿，就可以做成。　　得到麥桿後，如圖（一），把根梢折去，只留中間一段，就用你的指甲，如圖（二）的點綫樣長，劃一條縫。劃的時候要注意，不要太重，或太輕，因爲要劃破麥桿的。　　劃好，就是已經做成，現在可以把甲端，放進嘴唇吹，那麽就有一種很動人的樂聲吹出。柳仙人　　跑到花園裏，跑到田野間，不是有一種樹，生着碧綠的小葉，很可愛的在風中飄蕩，這種樹就呌柳樹（楊卿）。要做枊仙人，就得從這種柳樹上去找，找得同圖（三）一樣的柳枝。找得之後，把枝皮連葉，勒至兩枝梢頭，使成球形後，兩枝打一擊，把枝根頂在指尖上，（無論什麽上），柳枝就不會跌落，同圖（四），卽是柳仙人。吹小球　　同第一個玩具一樣，也要找得一根麥桿，不過不只是一根麥桿，還須得到一粒小豌豆。（這種豆是圖小如黃豆大，也是從田野間找得的。）現在就可以動手做做，把麥桿一端，折分四爿，再向外折，如圖（五）。把豌豆放在麥桿甲端上，頭朝天，含在唇上吹，那拉豌豆，就騰空滾着，像一粒小球，在空中要上不上，要下不下的。琳兒的疑問  汪乾綽　　星期日那天，琳兒和他的父親到江邊去散步。江上那些來來往往的輪船，忽然使琳兒生了一個疑問。因此問他的父親道：「爸爸！爲什麽那些小石子在水裏會沉下去，而這些大輪船在水裏却不沉呢？」他父親撫摩着他的頭，微笑着答道：「好孩子！這的確是個有價値的問句。現在讓我告訴你吧。凡是一個在水中的物體，如較同容積水的重量大，就會沉下。如較同容積水的重量小，就浮在水面上。如和同容積水的重量相等，就會停留在水中。小石子所以會沉下，大輪船所以會浮在水面上，就是因爲一個較同容積的水重，一個較同容積的水輕的原故。」快樂的學生時代  績溪縣立中心小學汪國雄　　我們做學生的時代，是人生最快樂的時代，何以呢？因以呢？因爲現在的我們，衣食及一切事情，都有人擔負，而我們唯一的使命，就是讀書求智識，這樣豈不快樂嗎？所以我們對於這個快樂的學生時代，萬萬不要放過才好！　　諸位呀！快！快！快！趕快！趕快！趕快乘這個機會，努力！努力！努力！努力向學問的路上前進吧！</p>

<p>婦女園地第十一期優生學的末路  許席珍　　在近代文化發展的路程上，第一次世界大戰顯然地成了一個不可磨滅的時代的路碑。它所給予人們的敎訓，除開暴露了統治者的面目之外，就是給了一般學者以理論與事實衝突的醒覺。世界大戰後，資本主義的發展，用了高速率進行着，而它底末路——經濟崩潰的來臨，也因之呈了一種急趨直下的形勢，大戰前一般空談理論的學說，同時也得到了一個實騐的機會，優生學便是其中之一。　　優生學的唯一目的，便是企圖根據生物學原理來改善種族，他們把達爾文的淘汰與選擇的法則來處理種族，而認定家庭是對於種族發生直接關係的社會組織。因之優生學者在家庭問題上，和社會學者同樣地用過了許多力：他們認定家庭是社會的單位，最大的原因便是因爲它具有生殖的機能。他們對近代的家庭組織渙散的現象認爲是一種可怕的病態，他們反對不營生殖機能的男女配合，他們反對女性從事社會運動（他們說婦女運動，卽使是必要的，也祇須讓少數缺乏「母性」的女子來幹；但這實際就等於反對，因爲所謂「婦女運動」，是不是「少數女性」的事呢？），他們認爲女子的天職就是做一個賢明的育兒婦，或一般的所谓「賢妻良母」，在改善種族的事業上做一點功蹟；他們一方面反對了個人主義的浪漫精神，另一方面又指斥了社會主義者的兒童公育。旣用了優生學做出發點，這些結論也是必然地無足爲怪的。在改善種族的目的上看，女性除了做個賢明的母親之外還能做什麽呢？要解釋或者否定以上的命題，根本是一件繁瑣的事情；譬如說，要企圖說明兒童公充的利弊，女性從事於合理的社會制度之取得的必要性等等，都是專家的工作，而同時，在這裏，我們也不想儘用一些社會主義的專名或甚至惡意地指斥優生學家的謬論。我們僅想用目肖社會上的事實來說明女性的天職是否僅止於「養育優良的嬰兒」，和這種種設計究竟有否存在的可能。　　首先我們看一看資本主義發達得較早的國家；大戰的前後，在緊張的形勢下，大家都想找尋一種新的刺激，個人主義的意識分子潛進了文學與社會學，享樂的追求，伴着愛好自由的特殊民族性，使社會上的家庭組織日趨不穩固了，這現象的興趣當然不是突然的，生產的方法到了工業革命的階段，同時家庭的組織也開始逐漸地渙散了，這是優生學家非常憂慮着的一種現象。勞働階級的女子抛開了育兒的「天職」或家庭瑣事跑進廠，和齒輪馬達工作伴去了，有產階級的智識女性也不再高興給小孩子擾着了。人們爲了生活，爲了亨樂，都把小孩子當作一個可恨的累物，但那個時候僅止於「可恨」而已，而到了資本主義崩潰的現在呢？小孩子是要的，可是缺少撫養的能力是事實。我們跑進金元國家的偉麗城市，你可以去看看產科醫院的接見定裏每天有多少男子的心在跳着，「該死，可怕的小孩子哪。」　　在中國，家族觀念是比何國家都濃厚，照例似乎不會勞優生學家的擔憂與諄諄以育兒的本職來敎誨的。可是目前的事實怎樣呢？一小部份（極小的一部份）受了敎育的人們染着個人主義的氣息也不願生育了，而大部份給「不孝有三」的古訓形式了中心思想的小市民則大部是願意生育的，可是「生」是生了，「育」却大成問題，結果是社會上徒添了一班「半生不熟」的份子。至於工農階級的人呢？直截了當的一句話：「兒子養不起！」女的生了孩子，認爲是一個絶好的機會，全部丢了自己的兒子上公館裏做奶媽去了。對於這，她們並不是完全不覺得有什麽缺憾的，她們也一樣的懷恨着自己能力的薄弱，工廠中待遇孕婦的苛刻，她們無時無地不感到：「這世界有點不對。」　　不是不要家庭；而是維持不下去，怎麽辦呢？優生學重的理論與擔心，對於她們是一點用處都沒有的。她們卽使自己願意做「賢妻良母」，可是現實却使她們懷疑了。在這樣的環境下面，人口的生產率愈旺盛，社會上的貧血的，衰弱的，愚昧的人也就愈多，結果當然是不堪設想的。　　在合理的社會制度下的新女性，一定不會是憂生學家理想中的「良好育兒婦」，她們底勞力不會僅化在催眠歌與哺乳上面的。而社會制度如儘像現在那樣的混亂，「優生」又何從「優」起呢？　　對於這，優生學家一定會說：「那不是我們的事」，可是就因爲那般學者們忽略了作爲社會基礎的經濟組織，所以直到現在，優生學家幻想中的「昇平世界」，始終成了二十世紀的理想國。　　新時代的婦女，不會（也可以說是不能）再關在家裏做育兒的工作是事實。在我們，正認爲唯有這樣，才能走近合理的社會制度。世界大思想家對於婦女問題的意見（四）  華　　四約翰·穆勒約翰·穆勒（ＪｏｈｎＳｔｕａｒｔＭｉｌｌ）生於一八零六年，逝於一八七三年，爲當時英國的大哲學家，政治活動者，兼經濟學家。他的父親，詹姆斯·穆勒，是古典派經濟學的權威——李嘉圖的著名學生之一。所以，小穆勒承祖先生的餘蔭，也是古典派經濟學衰微時代的代表人之一。他著有「政治經濟學原理」一書，將十九世紀上半期英國所流行的經濟思想，加以槪括，使之統系化。　　約翰·穆勒，也是個首先力主婦女平權說者之一。他於一八七零年，發表他的名著「婦女依從論」一書，流行頗廣。他在這本書中，首先從社會發展的見地上推論，婦女必定要同男子處於平權的地位。他說：「假使人們都以爲，兩性平權說，只是根據於理論；那麽應當記着，兩性不平等說，除理論而外，也是沒有任何理由的。凡實際經騐證明兩性平權說爲有益者，這無非是說，人類只有在這一制度（男女平等）之下，才能够生存，時至今日我們所見的這種進步和幸福階段。·····經騐肯定地證明，每月一步改良，婦女社會地位必隨之而提高一步，歷史家和哲學，必然要以婦女社會地位的增高或降下，作爲測量某一民族或某一世紀的文明之最凖確最精當的尺度。我人試一檢討人類歷史的一切時代，就可看到，婦女地位在實際上是不斷的接近於和男性平權。單此一點，雖不能充足證明，此種運動必然要達至十足的平權，然無疑的，這亦可作爲若干推斷的資料：事實確是如此。」直到現在，有些反對婦女解放的人，其主要論據，謂婦女天禀資質，根本不及男性，意思是說，婦女是天生而爲「賤種」，不應與男子平等。其實這種意見，還是一種傳統的謬論。約翰·穆勒早就說：「最頑固最執拗的毒駡婦女的人，都不敢否認，凡男子能作的事，婦女—若將近代的經騐和過去諸世紀的經騐加在一起，可說不是少數婦女，而是大多數大多數婦女—也無不會作的，而且作各極其順手，極其誠摯。最重要的是，許多事件，還沒有一個女性成功作得像男性中若干—極少數—那樣作的好，也有些事體，她們還未達到最高的至善階段。禁止女性跟男子競爭一部分類似的職業，乃是對女性權利的極大的侵害，對社會的極大的損失，此理難道還不明顯麽？······兒童的口腔衛生  友白　　口腔是食物入體的門户，若口腔不洗，牙齒不刷，就可在無意之中把各種的病菌隨飲食呑入腸胃，傳染生病，且食物的殘渣汚滓，附着齒的内外，慢慢的使牙跟發炎，或病毒侵入齒髓，發生齒髓炎，華好好的牙齒成　齒，初則咀嚼不便，時常牙痛，神經不安，繼則發生各種胃腸病，結果，妨礙了全身的發育。尤以兒童時期，胃腸薄弱，發育未完，蒙害尤易。　　從上面看來，口腔的衛生對於兒童的健康，關係這樣密切，那末凡是負責有敎養兒童之責的父母師長，必須養成兒童口腔衛生的習慣。最簡而易行的方法如左：（一）每日晨晚刷牙二次，牙刷要洗凈弄乾（二）食後漱口。（三）少吃糖果，尤其是棗子。（多吃了易傷琺瑯質）（四）不嚼硬物（五）不吃過冷過熱的東西。（六）不把手指或銳筆桿等物，伸進口裏。（七）不用指甲或其他不潔的東西　牙。　　當父母師長發見兒童的牙齒畸形發育，重疊發育，　齒時，應該到牙醫處去矯正和治療治，務使他們的牙齒，得到正常的發育，保持全身發育的正當，培養出一個身體健全精神快樂的小國民—中國將來的主人翁。海外婦訊  碧梧　　（一）國際婦女門户開放聯盟（ＯｐｅｎＤｏｏｒＩｎｔｅｒｎａｔｉｏｎａｌ）國際婦女門户開放聯盟是由十八國的婦女代表組織而成，本年一月五日起在巨哥斯拉夫的首都伯爾格來得開第三次大會，到代表八十餘人，討論問題，爲：婦女職業問題，旣婚婦女勞動問題，婦女筋肉勞動問題等等，一致議决反對加於此等問題上之一切限制。　　（二）國際男女平等恊會（ＥｑｕａｌＲｉｇｈｔｓＩｎｔｅｒｎａｔｉｏｎａｌ）國際男女平等恊會第五届大會，於去年十二月開會於日内瓦，參加者有二十二國；；國際婦女門户開放聯盟及美國婦女團，俱已加入。該會以前以獲得男女平等權爲目的，現已略有變更，將傾其全力於締結男女平等國際條約方面。其思想與行動，大抵與美國婦女團相行動。　　（三）太平洋婦女會議太平洋婦女會議，以太平洋沿岸各國及與此有關之英國，印度的婦女代表所組成，合計爲十三國，定於今年八月，開會議檀香山，會期約一月。其主要議題，爲：勞動婦女與家庭問題，婦女與國際和平，婦女買賣問題，兒童與母親的衛生問題，婦女參政問題，職業敎育問題等。　　（四）汛美會議婦女的勝利去年十二月三日至二十六日之間，汎美會議第七届大會，開會於南美烏拉圭國的門得必多城，其時關於婦女提出兩大提案，其一：「在國籍法上，男女平等「，其二：「參加本會各國，在政治上，法律上，男女平等」。等二提案，僅以少數之差遭否决：其第一提案，則已通過。以前在國際聯盟主開之黑格國際法典編纂會議席上，曾提出與第一提案相類似之議案，當時雖經婦女竭力奔走，終於失敗；故此次汛美會議得以通過，可謂新大陸婦女的榮幸。　　（五）秘魯婦女選舉運動開始南美諸國，受其母國的影響，婦女運動，極爲銷沉。近因西班牙革命，趕走了專制君王，民氣漸伸，於是南美各國婦女，也漸現活氣。秘魯的首都利瑪，許多知名的婦女，觀於門得必多汛美會議時婦女的勝利，故開會决議，進行婦女選舉運動。　　（六）葡萄牙規定婦女選舉權的資格葡萄牙自革命之後，已給婦女以參政權，便資格上有所限定，卽：（一）有區議會選舉權者——負有扶養老小之職務的寡婦，離婚的婦女，别居的婦女，獨身的婦女。（二）有地方議會選舉權者——男子爲能讀與寫，繳納賦稅者。女子爲已受中等及高等敎育，或任公職者。（三）有中央議會及大總統選舉權者—具有地方議會之選舉權者。　　（七）希特勒治下德國婦女的否運希特勒的獨裁政府上臺以來，德國婦女遭受了莫大的否運，這是周知之事。開始卽以一聲「婦女應是家庭的東西！」的怪呌，而免了許多婦女官吏或敎師的職務，旣而又限制已婚婦女的就職權，去年十二月，政府與醫學團體的會議席上，又有排斥女醫的恊議。今年政府規定全國大學招生名額爲一萬五千，女子僅許爲一千五百人，爲總數的十分之一。而又於女子的入學試騐，多方刁難。學力之外，還須有體格人格的檢查。母心  諒　—日記的一頁—　　　　街頭轔轔的車聲，驚破我的好夢。朦朧中見窗隙間溜進來的陽光，告訴我時光，告訴我時光的不早仍鼓疲勞侵襲着的我，爲了工作，爲了生活，不能不支持着起來。看床裏熟睡着的曼兒，二頰紅得像熟透了的蘋果，乾燥的嘴唇，起了幾條裂痕，一雙眼皮浮腫着，這是昨夜啼哭的結果。平日總是笑着的孩子，誰都說乖得可愛的，昨夜這樣的哭着閙着，不用說，灼手的熱度，够使她受苦了。但疲乏而渴想休息的我，怎樣的不耐煩地加以訶責，多殘酷的我呀，「媽媽」我有愧了。替慧兒穿衣，洗臉，配置早餐後，自己也就草草的整理一下，塡飽肚子，已八點半鐘了。向王媽（她是我出外工作時惟一的托付者）說了照例的怎樣照顧曼兒外，還要她特别留心她的寒暖，飲食，因爲她的熱還沒有全退。這樣就帶了慧兒。怱怱的出了門。六歲的慧兒，有着好奇好動的天性，簡直沒有片刻的靜止。不懂得危險，不知道利害，試這樣，拿那樣，確是孩童最難管束而最須敎育的時期了。幸而我和他在同一個校裏，得時時顧到他的行動，不然，我不知將怎樣的爲他担心呢？今天有四節功課，實在並不算忙。恐回家後沒有餘暇的緣故，敎材的支配，參考的採集，課卷的批改，整整的塞滿了空的時間。但因爲夜裏的失眠，曼兒的疾病，使我心不在焉的不能全神貫注的工作。前天陳主任向我說，我級近來的整潔和秩序大大的退步，這次全次算術競賽又墊了末。他的言語，含着警告的意味，我是覺得的。我原也是個好勝的人，並非不想樣樣的出人頭地，可是環境總是這樣的困人。我的身體，自生了兩個孩子後，旣沒有好好的調養，又沒有適當的休息，已是大非昔比。近來因爲工作的繁忙，更覺精神不濟。照這樣下去，别說學校要對我不滿，自己也覺得難於應付了。可是一轉念，失業的恐慌不將加重精神的痛苦嗎？我惟有做，勉力的做！　　最後的鐘聲響了，我好像被赦般地—這並不是我不忠於工作，曼兒的病實佔了我整個的心—挈了慧兒回家。進了門，從王媽手裏接得後，心頭壓着的重負，已放下了一半，因爲從她的臉上，額頭，知道情形沒有像我在校裏預料的那樣壞。在我的一疊連聲的問句：「哭嗎？」「粥吃了嗎？」「幾次？」「多少？」「睡覺時間長嗎？」「大小便怎樣？」「熱什麽時候退盡的？」王媽的答覆，使我感到滿足了。憂慮像烟般地暫時消失。劍回來，見曼兒的口角上已掛了一絲微笑，展開臉上的愁雲，强作笑顏的向我說：「有你這樣的媽媽，小孩子們總不致十分吃苦的·」這是安慰我的話嗎？反使我不安了。一個能力薄弱的母親，曾竭了全力作生活的爭門鬥，孩子們的幸福，雖是榮繞心頭的唯一願望，可是仍不能不爲時間和精神的限止而疏忽。原因並不是不愛孩子，實在是太愛他們之故。晚膳比往日早了些，照例替慧兒温理了一回功課，料理些雜事，安頓了兩個孩子睡覺後，自己也想後的安息了。上了床，身體的疲乏已到萬分，但腦子仍不聽指揮的轉着，從孩子們的健康想起，孩子們的敎育，的前途，父母的責任，負担，職業和生活！！漸漸的，在許多模糊的影象中，失了知覺。婚後（續）  憐生　　窮雖窮，以賣文維持生活的我倆，每月亦可以從容的過活。住在亭子間裏，——臥室，廚房，會客室，飯室。我雖是生長在貴族的生活裏，一切以前不屑做，而現在全要做的事情，我一一地快活的做着，沒有埋怨過，沒有憂愁過。這使得他的友人們驚異，在前，他們不過以爲我只是漂亮的摩登的大學生而已，家裏的事，自然爲我所不屑做的事。但，事實却相反，每天的每天，我上菜市買菜，燒小菜，煮飯，洗碗鍋，洗衣服，掃地，拖地板····誰說不使他們嘆息，連他們鄕下出來的妻子，也不願去買小菜呢！我想找職業，他却不允許。他說：女人做什麽事，只是給機關作花瓶罷了！退一步，我說謀敎員之職吧，他亦不贊成，因爲這樣會給别的男人以機會來和我討好。有什麽法子呢？我不能不聽他的話，不然，我們的感情會因此破裂了。我只有，埋頭在寫文章，這樣，他是贊成的。肚裏有着孩子，已然七個月了，有時爲了一點小事而爭持，他便說孩子不是他的。「看生下來吧，不像我，就不是我的孩子！」好武斷的話，爲了這話，不知暗地裏流了多少淚，眞的，我能有什麽方法解說呢，而且誰會保定將來生下來的孩子會眞像他？這寃枉，將永達埋藏在自己的心底。　　因了他心的狹小，婚後，我便和以前的男友，斷絶了關係和通信——除非他的朋友。我不敢提他們任何人的名字，這樣，會使他妬忌而恨我。雖說這是他愛我的表現，我只覺得太拘束了我底自由，連以前的男同學，見了面理全不敢理，——唉！我感覺到他太自私了！　　全上午，是他寫文章的時間，自然，一句話也不敢和他多說的。我拖着沉重的肚子，來回的在樓下洗菜，燒飯。有時，菜味稍不好一點，他就埋怨，一點不會體貼你。常有時弄得自己飯全吃不下，一肚子的枉屈。然而他還要說：回家去吧，在家裏好做小姐，沒人駡。在這裏，你做錯了事我當然要駡的，我不管，誰還來管你？這一類的話。多麽使人痛心？又多麽使人灰心喲！春光明媚，春氣蕩漾着大地，使人輕鬆又陶醉。這時的他，在亭子間中再關不住了，提議要去西湖旅行，快生產的我，當然不好多動。只有勸他自己去，我自己可以好好保重的。他不放心我，便又不提再去了！可是，在房間一悶起來，就要說我太牽連他，不給他去散心—唉！他多麽忍心，會說出這種話來，我也只好對他苦笑，實在的，我的心已創痛得片片碎了！現在，他天天喊着要離婚。五月一日，我倆結婚紀念日，我們恊意在那天兩人分居，其實就是離婚。孩子，他說不管，隨我怎樣處置。「生產費呢？」「我留下百元給你吧。」他說。唉！我沒什麽好說，婚後的生活，是如此！（未完）讀物介紹婦女問題十講  紫文　　日本本間久雄著章錫琛譯開明書店出版一元五角婦女歷來是處於「作人」的地位的，但時代的進展，决不許這般地永遠存在，因此婦女問題，才成了改造現社會的一個重要的問題。原著爲日本比較具有實學的學者，譯文亦甚流暢。全書共十講，對於婦女運動的由來及其意義，戀愛，結婚，離婚等等問題，均有精湛的發揮。亦可說是婦女運動的初步讀本。而時尙有譯者附的「中國婦女，思想的發達」一講。對中國過去婦女的否運，以及近來的解放運動等均有詳細的叙述。醫藥問答　　答山東泗水縣東高劉君天生：　　血蛭病係德文Ｓｃｉｉｓｔｏｓｏｍｉａｓｔｓ之譯名，中國醫籍上，並不曾說起過。來信所說血蛭病，是否經過有信用醫生診斷？按照天時地理，貴處或不應有此病，所以先生從前是否生長在南方？現患此病。有如何證候，最好來信詳告。打針之藥，二種相較，以Ｓｔｉｂｏｓａｎ爲佳。但若病日已久，肝脾已腫脹過甚，雖注射亦不甚見效，應早期用之。陳方之答</p>

<p>申報業餘周刊業餘漫談我們對地方自治應有的認識  公樸　　自從記者對於上海市政選舉一再爲文討論以來，近已引起各方之注意、殊感欣幸。不過有幾種意見應予解釋的：第一有人以爲祗注意於租界範圍，未免太狹窄了，當然，在租界市政選舉時，討論選舉及華人代表問題，最低限度要在希望上海市政之進步及選舉方法之改良，然而記者作此種討論之目的實不僅限於上海之一隅，更不是單指着上海市中具有複雜國際關係之公共租界而言，不過借着此種有相當歷史之市政制度，作爲討論之基點，以鼓舞市民對於市政之興趣，積極參加選舉，進一步更能够注意到全國政治，使民主政治之前途减少障礙而已。現在憲法草案已經公佈，國人對於此煌煌之國家根本大法作學理上探討者已是很多很多，然若祇是止於研究，則於憲政實現前途上是沒有多大裨益的。我們一方面固然希育國家有良好的根本法規之製定，民權保障得以確立，但我們更希望法律不是具文，而能在實際上澈底實現。所以考究憲法的優劣得失，雖屬重要，然在實際上顧慮逐漸施行的辦法，却有同樣的重要性，否則憲法將自然的成爲具文而失其精神。我們從市政方面着手來討論選舉的問題，其目的卽在從實際上來探討逐漸施行的辦法，因爲市政問題與市民的關係較切，較易引起市民的注意及興趣；而同時我們更知道一個國家的實施憲政制度，是必須從一地方來做起點的呀。　　還有人說，現在一般民衆對於政治可說都是抱着一種厭乘，絶望消極，和不問不聞的態度，以爲我國政治是沒有前途了。當然，二十餘年來黑漆一團的政治，確能使人悲觀，而各種改革政治的高調也唱够了，然到如今沒有一樣能實現，在這種環境下，一般政治興趣本來就缺乏，政　認識本來就很薄弱的我國人，對於政治不但不敢抱着任何改進的企圖，反而充滿着痛恨，厭惡的心理，原無足怪。加之現在社會上中產以下的人民無不感受着生活困難之壓近，失業窮困之威脅，因此，一般人孜孜爲利力圖温館之不暇，更那裏有閒情去關心到政治呢！此種心理若不打破，則充其量將使政治愈糟，愈不堪問，愈不易改革，以至亡國爲止。記者在第一次討論上海市政的文字裏，引證市蒙氏所說上海租界市政爲少數特權階級把持時，就力說產生這種現象的原因，就是山於市民太不關心政治的結果。所以，我們如要改進現狀，對於上海市政就應當澈底剷除以前之消極態度，悲觀心理，而代之以積極的力謀改良辦法的建設精神。　　第三種意見是，有人以爲公民訓練在目前現狀下是不容易收效的。殊不知政治之改革本非可以一蹴而成的。必須經過無數次的試騐，改良，演化，　可逐漸有淸明之望。卽以英國而論，牠雖是憲政制席最發達的國家，議會政治爲舉世所羨稱，但事實上它的政治上的缺點仍是所在多有。但就是這種政治，也不是立刻可以辦到，它是經過將近三百年的試騐改良的過程，並且在開始時還發生過流血革命的，所以我們對於研究政治的興味要濃厚，參加政治的勇氣要熱烈，旣不可易於失望，更不可抱着過分的奢望，希望一步登天。　　我們固然希望望民衆在政治理想上應抱有遠大的目光，大家積極的來討論並研究政治制度之得失，但在實際改良政治上我們更希望人民能從小處着想，逐漸謀改進的辦法，我們應當先從一地之市政改革入手進而讑於到全國政治之更新。現在憲法雖未施行，關然地方自治，却是已由中央政府着各省市切實施行矣。不過這件重要工作在各省市中似乎並沒有努力的促其實現，他們的理由是因爲一切的不安定，無暇顧及，但比較安定的江浙等省，地方自治的成績又在那裏呢？這實是他們無法自解的一件事。我們要了解地方自治是實現民治之基礎，地方自治不能澈底實現，根本是不能談到憲政的。我們且先不必責政府工作之無效率，應先自責我們自己太漠視地方自治的重要與太缺乏督促政府的能力耳。我們應深切的覺悟，若人民完全依賴政府，不能督促，沒有行施民權的能力，則雖有賢明的執政者，也會慢慢的腐化起來，試看現在中國連一縣市的自治還辦不好，那裏還能谈到全國的民治呢？生活坐擁書城  紀辛　　—一個圖書館員的生活—我現在住的地方，就像鴿子籠一樣的。「書城」，想到這個名字，我就覺得好笑。虧了那些人能有閒情和時間，來想起這個好聽的名字。我現在的確是坐擁書城，但是我的靈魂不需要這樣高聳的城牆來圍護了。　　走進門來，就是一種難堪的氣息，撲進你的鼻孔。一間長方形的很小的房子，還要被分做兩部份。一面是藏書室，我就是被關在這個地方。一面是閱覽室，是給學生來看書的。居中有一道門可以通過。臨着門口裝了一個四尺高的櫃子。我站在櫃子裏面，就像小店員樣的。天天到這裏來的顧客，都是學校裏的大學生。與其說這些顧客文雅些，不如說這些顧客更難對付些。　　我的工作，雖說是僅有六小時，但實際上是無窮盡的，永久都做不完的。從下午一點到五點，晚上七點到九點，都要伺候借書。因爲規則上的限制，每人只能一次借一册。有些做論文的，一小時看十幾册的也有。平常的日子，看書的人稀少些。臨到考的時候，這間房子就擠得滿滿的。這樣的日子，平均起來，總佔多數。所以一敲鐘以後，在這幾小時内，我總是沒頭沒腦的在這書堆裏亂鑽。尤其是晚上，因爲燈光强度的刺激，加上日間的疲倦，明明一本書是豎在面前的，也要反復幾次的方能辨别得出。　　假如不詳細的說，也許你以爲在上午還是可以自修的，實則上午的工作是更其繁雜的。每天的上午下午，茶房要從郵務處送來二次包裹。那都是一扎一扎的書報；大的，小的，從機關　來的，從學校裏來的，都要把牠們拆開來，將卷曲的壓成平直的，再去拿卡片盒子將　們登記下來。有許多新來的，又要按照牠們的性質分成門類。有時候，主任先生因爲要廣博的研究，跑到舊書舗裏論斤論担的買了許多書來，放在地板上像小山堆一樣。這樣無窮盡的担子，都是放在我肩頭上的。　　在這樣的地方，用這些時間，做這樣的工作，誰能不感到枯燥和疲乏呢？又怎能有給自己去享受的情緖和餘裕呢？　　說到待遇，也是會令人發笑的。論資格，我當然比不上。這兒多是學士起碼的資格，還有些是喝過洋水的。工作的時間都是一樣，但所拿的薪俸却各有</p>

<p>不同、最高的有低的二倍，甚至三倍，有拿九十元的，有拿四十五元的，也有支三十元的，我就是一個。但我並不感到委屈，因爲也有頂學士頭銜支三十元的。甚至有薪俸多的，工作倒少些。有位英國來的，他每月支薪九十元，每天只須工作三小時。這樣待遇的標凖，我不知道是怎樣訂定的。普通的說法，當然是歸於他們的學識—說資格，也許更確切些。但學識也並不是可光榮的東西，假如有錢將子女送進學校裏去，除非是低能兒，我想誰都會幹他們樣的玩意兒的罷。科學叢談日光機  添華　　對日光能（Ｓｕｎｓｅｎｅｒｇｙ）利用的研究，蘇聯是早就在從事着的。在塔什干（在中亞，距吾國新疆之疏勒城甚邇。）物理學所究所内，經過科學家曹費莫夫和法兌耶夫的努力，這種知識已漸將應用到日常實際生活上來了。冷天，利用他們發明的目光機，可將室内温度常保持在八十度上；還可以用來烹飪，燒湯，煮茶。熱天，通過牠的精巧的機構，可保持室内空氣新鮮凉爽而不變。　　一個簡單的日光機是安放在尾頂上的。牠向太陽旋轉着。這樣收集在機内的日光能就被傳送到室内，用以熱水，煮蛋，暖屋及他項工作。這裏，有些懷疑者或等要問，若遇到一個陰霾的雨天又怎樣呢？這也不用憂慮，日光機不光是「收集」日光能，還能「儲藏」日光能，以備陰雨天不時之需呢。　　在冬天，說起來有點可怪，日光機會比炎熱的夏天更有效率的儲藏日光能。這是因太陽光綫在冬天更純粹（Ｐｕｒｅｒ）的緣故。　　這種裝置日光機的房屋，在遼遠的北冰洋附近，是更見其需要的。太陽在這些寒冷地方是曬不暖地的，可是利用日光機，牠將爲這些地方的居民温暖他們用房屋了。日光能也是可傳送的，比如通過地下管，將牠送到白海岸邊，也的不了多少時間。　　日光能的利用又是異常省費的。像上面所叙述的那種日光機，一架不過値二十個到三十個盧布。　　直到現在，日光機還是在試騐階段。雖然已有八架被應用着，而且效能很好，但發明家仍不肯說他們的努力已得到完滿的結果。不過，他們曾以决定的態度向人說明，不久的將來，每家人家將必有一個日光機在他們的屋頂上，好像現在我們有一扇窗子或一扇門在我們房屋的牆上一樣。　　現在這種研究仍在塔什干，烏茲貝其斯坦（中亞）進行着。似乎這是一個幻想—不必用許多複雜的機械，而能達到這樣的成功；但事實是這樣的擺在面前呢。小小專著一年來英國經濟之回顧  姚柯　　一九三年的英國經濟，不論在財政上，抑或在生產上，都表示出　大的進步。　　據本月十七日路透電英財相張伯倫的報告，一九三三年席英國財政的决算爲：收入七二四·五六七·○○○鎊，支出六九三·四九一·○○○鎊，因而有了三千一百萬鎊的盈餘。　　去年英國的工業生產指數也從一九三二年的八八·○升到第一季的八九·九，第二季的九一·七，和第三季的九一·七。　　因此，英國政府和一些樂觀的經濟學者便說英國已經突破了恐慌的重圍，而走入恢復繁榮的途徑了。　　可是事實上是那麽一回事嗎？且看下列諸種事實的答覆。　　去年，一方面是美元的跌價，一方面又有日元的競爭，於是在匯價上英鎊受了極大的打擊。匯價上受打擊的結果，在貿易上就表現出異常的不利。在一九三二年英國的輸出指數（金價）尙爲三六·一（以一九二九年爲基期），可是到了三三年便减到三四·三了。其中最惹人注意的，便是英國綿布的輸出，受了日本綿布傾銷的致命的打擊。三二年度英國綿布的輸出總額尙爲二·一九八百萬平方碼，可是三三年竟降至二·○三一百萬平方碼。日本綿布在三二年度的輸出額爲三·○三一百萬平方碼，三三年却增加到二·○八八百萬平方碼。印度本來是英國的殖民地，可是英國綿布之輸向印度者反而沒有由日本運去的多。不久以前所舉行的日英會商，便是由此而來的。在輸入方面，情形亦復相埒，計從三二年的四二·二（金指數）降到三三年的三八·五。　　在對外貿易上旣然受到了嚴重的打擊，那末在對内的生產機構上，勢必要加以一番緊縮。三三年度英國失業的人數，據英國勞工部的報告，雖然是比三二年减少了（三二年爲二百七十萬，三三年爲二百二十萬），可是這决不會使人輕易相信的。我們只要看一看曼徹司特綿布工人的罷工，英國煤礦工人的鬥爭以及最近飢饉旅行團，退伍軍人在倫敦的種種示威，便可反證英國失業者並未减少，而且他們的生活更趨惡化。三二年英國工人的工錢指數（以一九二九年爲基期）還逹九六·○，可是到三三年便急劇地降到九四·七。這不是工人生活日趨惡化的實證嗎？　　工人的所得雖然是減少了，可是他們的生活費却沒有平行地減少。三二年的批發物價指數還只是八六·一，可是到了三三年七月以後，便迅速地騰漲到八九·九。因而在三二年底的生活費指數，到了三三年底依舊沒有下降。（指數俱爲一四三。）　　不但是這種種事實說明了英國經濟並未恢復繁榮，卽就前述之財政及生產的好况來說，亦復是虚僞的，欺騙的。　　去年世界各國生產指數的升高，只不過是一時的膨脹，這在上期本刋已經有人論述過、讀者當能記憶。而英國財政之所以有盈餘，則是由於把「欠美戰債並未列入」的緣故。所以，如果把欠美戰債也一起算進來的話，那英國的財政依舊是入不敷出的。　　可是，比之於其他資本主義國家，英國經濟總算是比較地穩定。穩定雖則是穩定了，可是要想恢復戰前世界王者的寳座，現在却仍是渺渺無期。國際無線廣播電臺土耳其的改造  怒濤　　自十七世紀以後，土耳其遭受了不幸的命運，先後受制於德意志和奥大利；十九世紀至二十世紀初，尤屬危險，領土置於刀俎之上，一任列强恣意的宰割；大戰告終時，土耳其因聯盟國的緣故，那更是備遭凌辱。這時，凱末爾基於吊民伐罪的認識，起而革命，以現世主義，工業主義等理論爲前提；一面枰擊國内特權階級，知國家乃人民的國家，殘暴的寡頭政治的絶不能持久，「汎回敎主義」的絶不能實現，乃一掃而空之；一面反抗帝國主義，動員全國羣衆，爲取銷不平等條約及收復失地而鬥爭。自一九一九年至一九　　　　　　　　　　時期的領導之下，繼續不斷的與惡勢力奮門，最後，因土希一戰，一九二三年七月洛桑和約成立，這才在土耳其的歷史上，劃下了一個新的時期。　　在新政治制度之下。土耳其所施行白種種猛烈的革命的變革，人所共知的，是廢除蘇丹和宗敎，以拉了字母代替阿拉伯字母，消滅紅帽和面網，婦女從重重壓迫下解放出來，以及敎育的國家化，這些，都是土耳其改造的基本條件。　　但是，還有别的不很爲人所注意的一種變革，就是什一稅的廢除。在以前，因什一稅的綠緣故，富人們都儘他的財產，購買一個或一個以上的農村的收稅權利，而付定額的稅租給政府，於是，他就轉過身來向農民榨取，使農民受到　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　所需要的生產品，而降低了生產。現在呢，這種制度是廢除了，農民是可以儘量的爲他們自己生產一切必需品，而一槪免稅，雖然他們所售出的榖物仍須納稅，但這稅是歸購買者擔負了。　　還有，土耳其政府對於人民的態度，也發生了很大的變革。一般的說來，在各國歷史中，政治上的改革，都是由苦於壓迫下的人民而發生出來的，換句苦於壓迫下的人民而發生出來的，換句話說，就是從國家的下層發動，而達到國家的頂　的；在土耳其却發生了恰恰相反的現象，從未曾聽說過政府把他的政策與人民商量，一切的改革，都是由　政權的一班人，採取一種注入式的方法，計劃一些出來，編入人民　必須遵守的法制之内，生生的呌人民服從。但在共和國成立後，這種現象是見不到了，凱末爾雖是處處把握着他狄克推多無上的權威，可是他仍然　勤勞的，常到民間去徵集人民的意思，使他們感到不但政府的設施都是爲他們謀利益的，並且告訴他們，人民自己才是國家的眞正統治者，一切權力都是屬於他們的。　　在目前，因爲他改革的基本條件，日趨於進展的緣故，凱末爾對土耳其的復興，已得到了全部羣衆的擁戴，獲得偉大的成功。「土耳其已經不是東方的西部前哨，而是歐洲的西部前哨」，這絶不是凱氏的誇大的豪語！　　下轉入第五及第六版</p>

<h3 id="e1">Hirota's Reply to British and American Ambassadors: Intention to Withdraw Declaration Regarding China; Attempted Exploration Fails, Corrective Document Issued; Britain and America Satisfied, Consider the Incident Concluded <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan is now retracting its position stated in the policy statement on China of April 17th. It is unknown whether Japan did this because this astonishing statement caused repercussions around the world. Foreign Minister Hirota now believes that the statement of April 17th did not "formally exist". The statement was issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was of an informal nature. Hirota has notified the diplomatic community of this and stated that Japan's policy regarding the Far East can be summarized by the second statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman on April 20: "We desire the unity and prosperity of China, knowing that Japan, due to its geographical location, can gain additional benefits if China is unified and prosperous. However, China's unity and prosperity must come from China's own awareness and efforts." It is reported that the Japanese government has replied in writing to the British and American ambassadors to Japan on Thursday night in accordance with this intention. As for the words in the second statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman on April 20, "It cannot be obtained by other powers claiming development, but it must be known that the era in which other powers or the League of Nations used their power to take advantage of China for their own benefit is now over," which were not included in the written reply to China on Thursday night, it seems that they no longer summarize Japan's policy. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Since Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota explained the declaration regarding China to British Ambassador to Japan, Lindley, the British government now considers the incident to be over. Officials formally stated to the press this afternoon that Foreign Secretary Simon will announce in the House of Commons on Monday that the government considers this to be "much ado about nothing" and is completely satisfied with and accepts Foreign Minister Hirota's explanation regarding the statement of April 17. Diplomatic circles believe that the American government shares the same view as Britain on this matter. According to a semi-official source here, "After Foreign Secretary Simon makes a statement in the House of Commons on Monday, there will be no further action." (Kokumin dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Tokyo Announces the Content of Anglo-Japanese Negotiations; Hirota Appeals to the Conscience of All Nations; British Ambassador Retires and Returns Home Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) British Foreign Secretary Simon, fearing that the British Parliament currently in session would inquire about the true meaning of the so-called informal statement of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ordered Ambassador to Japan Lindley to visit Foreign Minister Hirota to prepare for a response in Parliament. All details have been reported in previous dispatches. Foreign Secretary Simon will report the content of Ambassador Lindley's meeting with Foreign Minister Hirota to Parliament, and Tokyo will also announce it at the same time in order to dispel misunderstandings from Britain, America, and other countries around the world. The content of the meeting is generally as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e3">Questions from Ambassador Lindley <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(1) What is Japan's view on the application of the Nine-Power Treaty to China? (2) Does Japan maintain the Open Door Policy and the principle of equal opportunity in China? (3) Does Japan intend to hinder other countries' trade with China? (4) Japan claims that the supply of weapons to China by various countries is disturbing peace in East Asia. Which country is Japan considering to be disrupting order in China? Foreign Minister Hirota's response: The words of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities were informal, and it was unexpected that they would attract the attention of Britain. I now answer the questions. (1) Japan maintains the Nine-Power Treaty on China, which has not changed in the past or present, and has no intention of violating the treaty. (2) The same applies to the Open Door Policy. Japan also hopes for the opening of China's door. (3) There is no intention to hinder other countries' fair trade with China. (4) It is difficult to answer which country is considered to be disrupting order in China. One can only ask the conscience of those currently supplying weapons to China. Japan cannot stand idly by when a fire is started in its neighbor's house.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on the evening of the 26th, the main points of the English translation of the statement were conveyed to British Ambassador Lindley and American Ambassador Grew by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the content of the meeting was also published. (Dentsu dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan, Lindley, retired because of old age and left from Tokyo Station at 1:40 PM on the 28th. Executives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and many others went to the station together to see him off. The ambassador is scheduled to take the Queen of Asia from Yokohama at 3:00 PM today and will return home via Canada. Before the successor ambassador arrives, it is said that Counselor Tredennick will temporarily take over his duties. (Nichiren dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that Foreign Secretary Simon will elaborate on Japan's declaration of "No encroachment on China" in the House of Commons on Monday and will submit to the House the telegram reporting British Ambassador to Tokyo Lindley's conversation with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota. He will also present a document given to him by Foreign Minister Hirota a few hours after Ambassador Lindley and Ambassador Grew received the official Japanese declaration on the matter. The official Japanese declaration to the United States has several points that differ from the original declaration made by the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. There are currently no signs in London that the British government will take further action on this case. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Main Points of Hirota's Document as Reported by the Japanese News Agency: Contacted Director of Information, Amau; Created Official Translation Delivered to US Ambassador <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of Japan's unofficial statement, American Ambassador Grew previously visited Foreign Minister Hirota, requesting the official English translation of this unofficial statement. Foreign Minister Hirota replied that this was an informal conversation and would contact Director of Information Amau to create an official translation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent this translation to the US Embassy yesterday. (Dentsu dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew visited Foreign Minister Hirota on the 26th, he requested an English translation of the statement on China policy recently issued by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As a result of consultations between the Foreign Minister and his leadership, the contents of the statement were explained in English in great detail and a document was created. At 6 p.m. officials were sent to the U.S. Embassy to hand it to the Ambassador. The main parts of its content are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan is the stabilizing force of East Asian peace and bears the full responsibility for maintaining East Asian peace. This unofficial statement is nothing more than a declaration of the Japanese government's policy to the world.</p>
<p>(2) If China achieves its goals of unity and prosperity, Japan will also benefit due to its geographical relationship. Therefore, the Japanese government has no intention of interfering with China's right to independence. However, China's unity requires China's own awakening and efforts, and it can never be achieved by other countries seizing benefits for themselves.</p>
<p>(3) The Japanese government has no intention of interfering with the rights and interests of third countries in China. If third countries engage in commerce and trade with China, mainly for the benefit of the Chinese people, the Japanese government welcomes such activities by third countries.</p>
<p>(4) The Japanese government has no intention of violating the Open Door Policy and the principle of equal opportunity in China, or existing treaties.</p>
<p>(5) However, if the Japanese government sees third countries taking actions that disrupt East Asian peace and order, it will resolutely oppose them, regardless of their form or reason.</p>
<p>(6) The Japanese government hopes that various countries will recognize the fair and free actions of "Manchukuo," but Japan has no territorial ambitions for "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>(7) In short, Japan and other Asian countries, especially China, share the responsibility for maintaining peace in East Asia. (Nichiren dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Ariyoshi Meets with Hirota, Denies Military Assistance from Various Countries; Calls for Japanese Not to Be Overly Sensitive <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Ariyoshi Akira, the Japanese minister to China, returned to Tokyo today and went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 1:40 PM to meet with Foreign Minister Hirota to report on his return and all circumstances. (Nichiren dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After meeting with Foreign Minister Hirota this afternoon, Minister Ariyoshi made the following remarks to reporters: There is no important matter for this return. The Nanchang Conference is also a routine matter and does not have the nature of a conference. The League of Nations' aid to China is actually under investigation and has not yet materialized. How the League of Nations wants to do it is quite good. However, because Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, international capital loans to China through the League of Nations will become an international joint management of China excluding Japan, so it is absolutely opposed. If the various countries provide separate and legitimate assistance for industrial development, it is not a problem. As for the supply of weapons, since Chiang Kai-shek is suppressing the communists, weapons may also be necessary. Other economic and military assistance from the various countries are only rumors, and although there may be some truth to them, one should not be overly sensitive. In short, it can be asserted that Sino-Japanese relations will improve. (Dentsu dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Minister to China Ariyoshi Akira and his party arrived at Tokyo Station at 9:00 AM this morning. Minister Ariyoshi told reporters that recently foreign countries have gradually understood Japan's fundamental spirit in East Asia. I believe that Sino-Japanese relations are better than last year. The problem of the country of origin marking regulations has been satisfactorily resolved, and other pending Sino-Japanese issues are gradually being resolved. Therefore, now is not the time to initiate concrete negotiations. The Japanese government and public attach great importance to the Nanchang Conference, but in fact the meeting is not of great importance. It is just Huang Fu going south to meet with Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek. Various pending issues in North China are currently being resolved. The so-called traffic issue is just a matter of changing trains. Postal services between China and "Manchukuo" have in fact been implemented, but because "Manchukuo" is not recognized, supplementary fees are charged. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement on China policy has caused a stir in various circles. Among the League of Nations' technical cooperation with China, nothing is currently being implemented. Japan has no intention of interfering with foreign aid to China, but if the aid takes a wrong step, it will lead to the problem of international management of China. However, various countries are forced to implement legitimate development projects separately. As for the purchase of military supplies, because it is the life and death problem of the Chinese government to suppress the Red Army, it is necessary to purchase the necessary weapons from foreign countries. Japan does not need to be overly sensitive about China's purchase of military supplies. In short, Sino-Japanese relations have yielded considerable results under the understanding of the two countries. I hope to promote its concretization through direct negotiations (which have already begun). (Nichiren dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Canadian Attention <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(London) The London Times Ottawa dispatch stated that the Canadian government is closely monitoring the development of the Far East situation and considering the impact of Japan's declaration of China policy on April 17 on Canada. Canadian Minister to Japan, Marler, has returned home on sick leave and has now returned to Vancouver. The Canadian government will listen to his report on the situation.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) A well-known foreign national in Hong Kong recently traveled to Siberia and stated that Soviet Russia is now openly making military preparations, fearing that war will break out in the East.

<p>(Geneva) The British Trades Union Congress passed a resolution, urging the British government and the people of the country to pay attention to the current crisis situation in a very strong tone. The resolution stated that the world war is getting closer and closer, and we should try our best to bring the United States and Russia closer to the League of Nations, and that the British government should take rapid steps to invite Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations and ensure that Soviet Russia obtains a permanent seat on the Council. The above resolution of the Trades Union Congress has attracted great attention in Geneva. People in Geneva believe that the Soviet Union is ready to join, but on the condition of obtaining a permanent seat on the Council. Judging from the resolution of the Trades Union Congress, it can be seen that British public opinion strongly advocates the joining of Soviet Russia. Recently, the Conservative Party's newspaper, The Observer, stated that the British government now wants to urge Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations, believing that it can counteract Japanese threats. This is generally believed here. It is generally expected that the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations in China in May, followed by the General Disarmament Committee on May 29, will have new developments.

<h3 id="e10">U.S. Navy Reunion Asks for Funds to Implement Shipbuilding Program; Mere Gestures Are Meaningless; Now Is the Time to Expand the Navy <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Navy Reunion issued a declaration today, stating that if funds cannot be allocated to continue the shipbuilding program stipulated in the Vinson-Trammell Act for a superior navy, the U.S. Navy will fall to third place. The Navy Reunion solemnly stated that although the Vinson-Trammell plan has been passed by Congress and signed by the President, these gestures are meaningless unless they are supported by funds to build the 102 battleships and 1,184 naval aircraft permitted by the plan. The declaration also requested Congress to pass a budget allocation bill to subsidize the plan. The declaration concluded by saying that now is the time to bring the U.S. Navy to the limits allowed by the treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States seems to be waiting for detailed reports from the British and American ambassadors to Japan before taking concrete action against Japan. Observers now believe that Japan's declaration has closed the door to consultations between Japan and the United States on Pacific issues, which are also the prelude to the 1935 naval conference. Officials claim that all countries related to the Far East should participate in this preliminary meeting. What can be predicted at present is that consultations among the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty may be the only action. (Kokumin dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan will review diplomatic issues and various committees are scheduled to meet on the 2nd of next month. According to the review committee members, since the Japanese side's so-called statement is an expression to foreign countries, the various countries should jointly assume responsibility for signing the Nine-Power Treaty and the Covenant of the League of Nations. The actions of Japan that exceed the treaty should be strictly corrected. China, as a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty and a member of the League of Nations, and also insulted by the Japanese side, should open up a path in this and use the international sacred treaty to seriously correct and restrain this expression from the Japanese side. Regarding this point, it is the unanimous opinion of the various committees. After the review is finalized and submitted to the general meeting for discussion, it will be sent to the central government for suggestions and handed over to the diplomatic authorities for reference.

<h3 id="e13">New York Times Editorial: Signatories to the China Treaty Should Respect the Dignity of the Treaty <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Washington, 26th - The New York Times editorial stated that President Roosevelt instructed the U.S. State Department yesterday to narrate a summary of the privileges and obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty. This fact is extremely simple. According to the Nine-Power Treaty, in addition to agreeing to respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity of China, the various countries also agreed never to support their own people in seeking any means to obtain general preferential rights related to commercial or economic development in any designated area in China. Although the Japanese side claims that it has no intention of violating the regulations and reserves the right to interpret them, according to the Japanese statement, it is clearly in violation of the treaty. According to the opinion of the editorial writer, according to Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty, apart from China and Japan, Britain and other signatory countries should have joint diplomatic action. From the perspective of London and Washington, doing so is not only for the benefit of their countries, but also to respect the solemn treaty that is still in effect. If Britain, the United States, and other signatory countries do not consult with each other regarding Japan's clear violation of the treaty, then those countries themselves cannot avoid the suspicion of violating the treaty.

However, the most meaningful plan is the proposed simulated war exercise, and an exercise in rapid transportation from Melbourne Port to Darwin Port.

<h3 id="e17">Has Japan's Position Really Been Cancelled? <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Reuters Tokyo dispatch stated, "Japan is now retracting its position stated in the policy statement on China of April 17th." "Foreign Minister Hirota now believes that the statement of April 17th did not formally exist," and so on. At first glance, it seems as if Japan is indeed showing signs of softening due to the strong pressure of world public opinion. In reality, under the control of warlord forces, the Tokyo government would not dare to directly and readily admit defeat without suffering a serious material blow. Furthermore, considering the long-standing and calculating nature of Japanese diplomacy and the significance of the content of the April 17th statement, it can be asserted that the issuance of the statement was by no means a hasty and ill-considered action. It is safe to say that the international reaction was already anticipated by the Japanese, and their plan to respond to it must have been carefully planned. Therefore, the claim of canceling the position should be seen as a predetermined step by the Japanese, rather than a sign of Japanese softening. Knowing this, we should not only not be complacent about it, but also take it as a profound warning. The Japanese have been plotting against us with great care for decades. Whenever their policy towards China seems relaxed, it is when they are actively preparing their invasion plans. They are good at playing the game of feigning retreat to advance.</p>
<p>Now, try asking anyone who knows the situation in the Far East, "Is Japan really willing to repent, change its course, and interact with China in the spirit of genuine friendship?" The answer will undoubtedly be "no." Therefore, the claim that Foreign Minister Hirota's recent statement of canceling the position can erase the marks that have been clearly etched in the minds of the world these past ten days or so, who would believe it? It is precisely because these marks cannot be easily erased that the initial mission of issuing the statement can be considered achieved. The target of the statement is to oppose all international aid to China in terms of technology or finance. Its form of creating enemies is multifaceted. However, it is unlikely that the Japanese will rely on their existing strength to take a further step and directly exert pressure on all sides. No one in their right mind would want to engage in hand-to-hand combat everywhere and put themselves in a position of certain defeat. Moreover, the cunning Japanese would never do this. From this, it can be inferred that even if the League of Nations continues to conduct technical cooperation with China, the Japanese can only exert limited direct pressure on the League of Nations. If that is the case with the League of Nations, which has no military force, it goes without saying for Britain and the United States, which possess powerful military forces. To give one example, Japan's opposition to the import of American aircraft into China is permissible in mere words. However, if they were to directly block Chinese ports with warships, preventing imports, or even intercepting them halfway and forcibly extracting them, it would inevitably lead to war. This is something the Japanese would not want to rashly engage in. Therefore, the statement of April 17th is nothing more than an attempt to make the League of Nations, Britain, the United States, and other countries add another layer of caution when dealing with matters. At the same time, it is an extremely serious warning to our country. The League of Nations and the United States do not need to fear Japan's direct pressure, but the added concern that comes with it cannot be dispelled by Foreign Minister Hirota's statement of "canceling the position." As for the threat to our country, it has the possibility of being realized at any time. Japan only needs to use indirect means to force our country to close its doors and not interact with the League of Nations, Britain, and the United States, while placing itself in the position of a third party that bears no responsibility. If the European and American powers complain, they should only question China and not involve Japan. This is the necessary strategy for Japan to implement its statement, which will make it impossible for the powers to use treaties to prevent it, and our country will have no way to rely on foreign aid to resist.</p>
<p>From this analysis, it can be seen that Japan's position taken in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement on the 17th has its own methods for maintaining and promoting it and will certainly not be canceled. Whether its existence is formal or informal is irrelevant. If our country truly wants to implement the purpose of resisting power, it should embrace the determination of fervent sacrifice, grit our teeth, and strive for the final victory. We must not be excited by Hirota's words today and frustrated by his words tomorrow. Intelligent countries like Britain and the United States should not be deceived by Hirota's smokescreen and adopt a "live and let live" attitude.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) On the 27th, Wei Yonghe, the commander of the Second Brigade of the War Zone Security Force, led his troops to Mashan Bridge and surrounded and disarmed 160 members of the rebelling Yutian militia. The remaining 150 members fled to Malage, guided by Japanese ronin. Wei inquired by phone with the Japanese garrison commander in the area whether they intended to lead the rebel unit across the Great Wall line into the puppet territory. The Japanese side replied that they would absolutely not allow it. The whereabouts of Wang Bingkao, the leader of the Yutian militia, are unknown. It is rumored that he is under surveillance by Wei Yonghe's troops, but officials have not confirmed this. It is reported that the rebellion was due to Wang's lack of command ability. His subordinates did not want to disband and, after being incited by Japanese ronin, supported Wang in rebelling, intending to join the puppet state. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng paid a visit to Yu Xuezhong this morning. After returning, he immediately used a long-distance telephone to instruct Wei Yonghe to be responsible for preventing the militia from fleeing abroad.

<p>(Tianjin) Official sources say that Wang Bingxiao's militia was recruited and trained by himself and was not approved by the provincial government. Wang had served as the Yutian security chief two years ago and was divided into two factions with the local gentry. When Hu took over Wang's troops, the two sides were quite at odds. Wang then recruited the militia for self-defense, and the funds were all from his private wealth. The battle at Yanhong Bridge two months ago was a conflict between Wang and Hu's troops. Later, they were defeated and retreated outside the city to Tuanshanzi. Recently, they were supposed to accept the provincial government's unconditional disbandment order, but were coerced by their subordinates and rebelled. Wang's father lives in Yutian City and has sent a letter urging his son to return quickly. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

Long-distance telephones have been installed throughout Fengrun County to facilitate the communication of news from various towns. The authorities plan to hold a county-wide event there and then continue in other counties. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the aborted Yutian militia mutiny, Yin Rugeng telegraphed Wei Yonghe, the captain of the security corps, from Tianjin, urging him to rush to Jixian to meet with Li Chao, the magistrate of Zunhua County, Chen Baosheng, the magistrate of Yutian County, and Wu Minghao, the magistrate of Jixian County, to go to Shimentown to summon Wang Bingkao and the militia captains to guide and persuade them. On the morning of the 28th, Wei arrived at Shimentown with the three magistrates and Li Weizhou, the leader of the Jixian militia, and invited Wang and the unit captains Zhao Wenyuan and Zhao Jingqi to talk. At that time, the unit had retreated to Mashen Bridge. Due to the unfavorable situation, more than a hundred people automatically dispersed. Wang has softened as a result and is expected to comply with the order for a peaceful resolution. The specific plan is still under negotiation and is expected to be decided on the evening of the 28th.

According to Ma, Ningxia Province is originally a poor area, and this time it was harassed by Sun Dianying's troops, causing great unrest. After the war, the dwellings were in ruins, and the cries of sorrow were everywhere. The villages and stockades of Pingluo Dengkou were looted for more than 200,000 yuan. They plan to request the authorities to investigate and compensate them. Yang Monkey's small band of bandits refused to be reorganized and led their troops to flee east, taking over 10 million in Ningxia banknotes and silver with them. Apart from the cash, the banknotes are rarely accepted in other provinces, which has a significant impact on Ningxia's finances.

<h3 id="e29">The Ministry of Finance Reorganizes Land Tax and Plans to Establish Standards for Handling Local Budgets <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to reorganize the land tax, the Ministry of Finance has formulated five standards for reorganizing local budgets and has sent them to the provincial governments for their information and compliance. Briefly, it states that in times of peace, taxes are lightly levied, but in times of chaos, taxes and levies are necessarily heavy. In the late stages of each dynasty, exploitation and oppression were rampant, leading to inevitable cycles of cause and effect and ruin. After the establishment of the Republic of China, military figures were autocratic, and internal strife was frequent. The people suffered from banditry and were also burdened by official rent. Working hard throughout the year was not enough to pay taxes. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang passed two proposals to reorganize the land tax, conduct land reporting, and reduce land tax surcharges to relieve the rural areas. These proposals aimed to clarify the tax amount, determine property rights, strictly eliminate abuses, and equalize the burden. As for land tax surcharges, they should be substantially reduced. As for county local budgets, they should be accurately verified. Miscellaneous taxes and levies have been repeatedly abolished by the Executive Yuan's order, but local revenues are often increased due to new policies or temporary anti-banditry efforts. Once they are added, they become the norm, accumulating endlessly. In some cases, land tax surcharges exceed several times the amount of the original tax. The root cause of the problem is that there is no definite budget for the locality. Now, if we want to reduce and fix the amount of taxes, we should first start by determining the local budget. Attached are five standards for handling local budgets: 1. Reorganize local finances and live within one's means, not the other way around, so as not to resort to excessive taxation. 2. Local administrative affairs must be considered in order of urgency and extravagance should be eliminated to ensure that income and expenditure are in balance. 3. The budget for the 23rd year must be prepared urgently. The ministry convened a financial conference to discuss the local finances and determine the budget. Local governments should make real cuts within the scope of not affecting necessary affairs, and compile a general budget and submit it for approval. 4. If there is any extravagance in the budget compiled by the counties, it should be strictly rejected. 5. After the budget is determined, if there is a surplus in the counties, it should be turned over to the provincial government. If the province has a surplus, it should be reported to the central government for approval and accumulated for local construction in the province. The county budget will be approved by the province, and if there is a shortfall, the province will find ways to subsidize it from the provincial treasury. The provincial budget will be approved by the central government, and if there is a shortfall, the central government will find ways to subsidize it. It is requested that you investigate, forward these to those who need to know, and earnestly comply with them, and also hope to see a reply. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e32">Jiang Orders Five Provinces to Ban Labor Unions from Collecting Membership Fees and Sets Working Hours at Ten Hours <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Jiang recently issued a telegram to the chairmen and party headquarters of the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian in order to reduce the burden on workers and accelerate production efficiency. The original telegram stated: Eliminating labor unrest and stabilizing society is currently the most crucial plan for the bandit suppression provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian. The primary cause of previous labor unrest has been demands for increased wages. Therefore, reducing the economic suffering of workers is the most effective way to eliminate labor unrest. The factory labor unions constantly collect membership fees or other fees from workers, causing the income earned by workers through their blood and sweat to be subjected to unnecessary exploitation. Although Article 17 of the Labor Union Law stipulates that labor unions may collect membership fees, regular fees, special funds, temporary fundraising, or shares from workers, this is a peacetime regulation. Under the special circumstances of the bandit suppression period in the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian, such regulations cannot be applied without modification in order to avoid interfering with the bandit suppression work and adapt to the current environment. All provisions of Article 17 of the Labor Union Law should be temporarily suspended in the five bandit suppression provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian. In the future, factory labor unions will not be allowed to collect membership fees or any other fees from workers. It must be understood that reducing the expenditure of workers is no different from increasing their income. This should be strictly prohibited, and the handling should be reported for review. Furthermore, eight hours of work is the general practice in various countries, but the main purpose of its legislation is to curb overproduction. China's production industry is already backward and does not suffer from overproduction but rather from insufficiency. To curb overproduction in an insufficient country is a misguided policy. Moreover, the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian have been affected by banditry for many years, and their production has declined even more than before. It will not be easy to restore vitality without striving to accelerate production. Although Article 8 of the revised Factory Law also stipulates that the actual working hours for adult workers each day should be eight hours in principle, there is a provision that allows for extending the hours to ten if the local situation or the nature of the work requires it. Therefore, under the special circumstances of the above five provinces, this provision should be appropriately applied to promote increased production. In the future, the daily working hours of workers in all factories, except for child laborers, should be set at ten hours as the standard, so that work that takes workers in other countries five days to complete can be completed by workers in our country in just four days. What is insufficient on a daily basis will be more than enough on a monthly or annual basis. The increased effort of one person is not obvious, but the combined increased effort of workers in several provinces will be enormous. By catching up quickly in this way, the contribution to the enrichment of national power and the restoration of local vitality will be significant. It is hoped that you will forward this telegram for compliance, pay close attention to the matter, and not allow factory owners to mistreat workers. If there is mistreatment, workers in that area can truthfully report to the local officials of the province, who will forward it to this headquarters for impartial handling, without any favoritism. Labor and management should each be treated fairly and live in peace, so that they can jointly overcome the economic crisis of the country. In addition to sending separate telegrams and orders, this telegram is specifically issued for compliance, and it is hoped that the telegram will be copied and posted at the entrances of all labor unions and factories for everyone to observe.

<p>(Nanjing) Chen Duxiu's case has been appealed to the Supreme Court for a long time.

Furthermore, when Han went to the north bank, Ge Xiangyi, a representative of the people of Heze, and the German Wan Binlai accompanied him. Lin Chengxiu, the director of the Ji Construction Department, promised that Hebei Province would provide one million yuan to repair the dikes on both banks. Ge requested the repair of the dangerous works at Liuzhuang on the border of Hebei and Shandong.

<h3 id="e39">The Kalachakra Dharma Assembly is Inaugurated; the Panchen Lama Presides over the Chanting of Sutras <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) The Kalachakra Dharma Assembly, presided over by the Panchen Lama, began construction at Lingyin Temple at 9:00 AM on the 28th. Before 9:00 AM, Zhang Zaiyang, Zhao Yanwu, Wang Yiting, and other directors of the association, as well as more than 200 monks from Lingyin Temple, held incense and formed a procession to welcome the Panchen Lama at Zhu Zhuang. The Panchen Lama then brought a small black foreign dog and rode in a yellow sedan chair to Lingyin Temple to begin presiding over the chanting of sutras. The ceremonies were similar to welcoming a deity. The congestion of the audience and those kneeling in prayer caused the clay Bodhisattvas to pale in comparison. A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to the Panchen Lama at his residence at 8:00 AM on the 28th. Through his secretary-general, Liu Jiaju, as a translator, the Panchen Lama said that this was his second visit to Hangzhou and that he would stay in Hangzhou for three weeks. Regarding the issue of returning to Tibet, he said that he would have to attend the Dharma assembly and would temporarily ask Secretary-General Liu to convey his views. At that time, those welcoming the Panchen Lama to the Dharma assembly were already lined up and waiting respectfully outside the mansion and sent several representatives to prostrate themselves before him. The reporter then took his leave. Later, according to Liu Jiaju, the Panchen Lama's return to Tibet was only a matter of time. When the Dalai Lama was dying, he had already expressed his sincerity in welcoming the Panchen Lama to Anqin Hutuktu and other representatives of the Panchen Lama who went to Tibet. At present, the authorities and people of both the front and rear Tibet are unanimously and enthusiastically welcoming the Panchen Lama. The chairman of the front Tibet government and religion, Silon Kasha, recently sent a telegram from Calcutta urging the Panchen Lama to return to Tibet. Moreover, the rear Tibet has now sent 56 representatives of all the monks and laity, including Ding Jieke Tu, to Beijing to urge his return. However, because the certification letters and other documents were still on the way, they had not yet formally met with the Panchen Lama. It is expected that Anqin and others will accompany them to Hangzhou to meet the Panchen Lama within a few days. At that time, the Panchen Lama will have a formal statement on the issue of returning to Tibet. As for when he will set off, he will listen to the orders of the central government. As for the original purpose of the Panchen Lama's return to Tibet, it is entirely to seek coordination between the central government and Tibet, not for personal power and position. In addition, Chairman Lin specially sent Xie Jian to Hangzhou to present the Panchen Lama with a white jade incense burner and several pieces of Magu as souvenirs and to express his condolences. Furthermore, the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly is scheduled to end on the 13th of next month. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Today, German Foreign Minister Neurath met with German journalists and issued the following statement on the issue of disarmament:</p>
<p>Negotiations on the disarmament conference have been underway for more than six months, but today France has abruptly undermined them. There is no need to refute the attacks and insults against Germany in the French memorandum, and France's other real intentions are also very clear. The figures in the German budget used for national defense are not its true target of attack. France has spent a huge sum of 1.6 billion francs on expanding its military preparations in the past year, and now it is surprised by its neighbor's military expenditure of 18 million marks, which is truly incomprehensible. Moreover, Germany has fully complied with its obligations regarding disarmament, but the other party's actions, namely the universal reduction of armaments by other countries, have not yet begun, and in fact, they have been delayed for several years, and today there is still no sign of implementation. The continued existence of such a state of affairs, such as Germany's unilateral disarmament while other countries' armaments are expanding to an unprecedented degree, or are still in the process of expansion, is absolutely unfair and politically impossible. If we want to judge this state of affairs based on fundamental legal principles today, we must first answer the following questions: Who is right and who is wrong between Germany and France? Should France insist on the reasons for its last memorandum, or should Germany demand equality of status and equal armaments with other countries, especially as sufficient as France? We are still willing to reach a peaceful understanding with France today, so we have sent a special representative for disarmament, granting him full authority to allow international negotiations to proceed smoothly. But today, we understand the dangers ahead, all of which are caused by France's actions. We only know that our viewpoint is flawless in law, morality, and politics, and we can wait for future changes without any doubts. (27th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and U.S. Disarmament Representative Davis held a meeting on disarmament at the White House today. Davis recently took leave to return to the U.S. and will soon return to Europe to participate in the Geneva Conference on May 23 as an unofficial representative. Davis did not participate in the discussions; his only task was to report important news to Washington. It is understood that Davis told the President that there is no hope for an early completion of disarmament, and the situation will become clearer in a month. Government policy has not changed. In his special message to Congress on January 3, President Roosevelt declared that the United States could not participate in European political problems but was willing to cooperate with Europe to complete any plan to reduce armaments or commercial barriers. Disarmament talks have now effectively stalled because France recently stated in its note that it cannot agree to disarmament because Germany is currently spending more money to rebuild its armaments. Britain still believes that the Geneva Disarmament Conference will achieve some concrete results. Disarmament talks have been underway for six months, and Britain has abandoned its hope of concluding a preliminary agreement with France, Italy, and Germany. (27th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>According to responsible sources in Riga, the Latvian government is dissatisfied that the Soviet Union and Germany are conducting negotiations alone on the issue of concluding a convention to guarantee the independence of the Baltic countries without seeking the opinions of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Therefore, the Latvian government intends to automatically propose to restart negotiations on this matter after obtaining the consent of Lithuania and Estonia. Latvian political circles believe that the inviolable nature of the Baltic countries should be recognized by all European countries, or by the League of Nations. Latvia's proposal is likely to be supported by Lithuania and Estonia. If so, the three countries will jointly conduct negotiations with European countries, and the first countries to be contacted will be Russia, Germany, and Poland. According to diplomatic experts here, since the Baltic neighboring countries have repeatedly expressed their concern for peace, it will be easier for the three countries to succeed if they make such a request.

<p>Riga The Soviet Union proposed to Germany to conclude a convention guaranteeing the independence and territorial integrity of the Baltic Sea coastal countries, which was rejected by Germany. A local socialist newspaper commented on this matter, saying that the German National Socialist government harbors aggressive intentions towards the Baltic Sea coastal countries, and the Soviet proposal is a good way to expose these intentions.

<p>Riga According to the Latvian national newspaper, the Lithuanian government recently submitted a memorandum to the governments of Latvia and Estonia, explaining the future cooperation plan of the Baltic Sea coastal countries. The newspapers welcomed Lithuania's proposal, recognizing it as a victory for Latvia's policy of establishing a Baltic Sea group in the past fifteen years. Some newspapers also said that it can be seen from the above memorandum that Lithuania has now leaned towards Britain, France, and Russia. Some people interpret Lithuania's proposal as aiming to show the Berlin government that Lithuanian policy does not need to be directed by Germany. (27th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) France is following in Britain's footsteps today, with its ambassador to Germany informing the German government that France will take any proposal to suspend the remittance of Dawes and Young loans very seriously. In other words, France, like Britain, hopes that German indemnity payments will continue to be remitted. However, Hjalmar Schacht of the Deutsche Bank has stated that Germany can no longer raise the necessary annual debt repayment of £23 million. German creditors are also meeting at the Deutsche Bank today to discuss the remittance issue.</p>
<p>Although their deliberations do not technically include Dawes and Young bonds, their resolutions will inevitably affect them. There is no doubt about this. The meeting will be divided into two subcommittees, which will continue to discuss tomorrow. Participants seem determined to oppose the complete suspension of remittances of over £10 million in 7% Dawes loans issued in 1924 and 5.5% Young loans issued in 1920. Britain supplied approximately £24 million for both loans, which are Germany's direct and unconditional obligations. The warnings from the British and French governments have caused great panic in financial circles. Secondly, the German creditors' meeting has opened in a completely new atmosphere, and its duration seems to be very short. German creditors feel that Dawes and Young loans cannot be made an exception, as this would harm a large group of German private creditors. Private creditors intend to clearly state that Germany must take concrete steps to create a more sympathetic atmosphere overseas, so that German goods can sell well. It has been said that Germany's inability to repay its debts is due to obstacles to its export trade. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Rome Today, the Italian King personally attended Parliament to perform the opening ceremony of the House of Representatives. This is probably the last House of Representatives in Italy. The Italian King stated in his speech that Italy sees the longest possible period of peace as necessary, and the greatest guarantee of peace is the efficiency of Italy's armed forces. The Italian government is now striving to increase the efficiency of the Italian army, but this relies on the construction of the legion as the basis, so that it can be expanded when needed, and on the unity of military power. Now it is necessary to strive to improve the physique of Italian youth and their military training, so as to raise the standard of military efficiency. It is important to renovate war equipment and unify military power. Italy, with its new political system as a guide for other countries, should be able to promote the revision of the constitutional government of other countries. The Italian King then spoke of the changes that will take place in the Italian Constitution, saying that these changes are sufficient to make the country's economic strength better disciplined. Italy is eager to assist in solving important issues in Europe and the world and is determined to maintain good relations with the Holy See. The Italian King ended by mentioning the need for a balanced budget and reiterating the Italian government's view of maintaining the gold standard. When the Italian King visited the House, he wore the uniform of Grand Marshal, while the members of Parliament and Prime Minister Mussolini were all dressed in black shirts. When the members of Parliament waited for the Italian King to visit the House, they all sang the Fascist Party song. When the Italian King mentioned constitutional changes and army reorganization, the entire House cheered in response. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e106">Italy, Austria, and Hungary Agree on the Post-Establishment Europe (Paris Correspondence) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The European political situation is showing significant changes. France's hegemony is gradually faltering. Aside from France, which is relatively stable, and a few countries like the Netherlands and Belgium, which have some solutions, the economic problems of the European continent are being stirred up by economic panic. In particular, Germany and the Danubian countries of Austria-Hungary are being severely shaken. In the past, four-power conferences were held in London under the guidance of France, and other conferences, such as the Lausanne Conference and the Stresa Conference, were aimed at solving the economic problems of the Danubian countries, but ultimately had no effect, instead making the problems more complex and harder to solve.</p>
<p>In this chaotic situation, Germany's economic situation is indeed deteriorating, reaching a point close to collapse. However, its political tone remains high, calling for the rejection of the Treaty of Versailles, demanding equal military status, and so on. At the same time, it is doing its best to stir up German patriotism, trying to form a system centered on the Germanic nation, and of course, aiming to divide the hegemony of Europe.</p>
<p>At this time, Italy is a country that is developing strongly, and at the same time, it is in opposition to France in Europe, in the Mediterranean, and in North Africa. It helps Germany, but does not want Germany to be too strong. Therefore, it takes advantage of this time – when Germany's strength is not yet sufficient – to first free Austria from Germany's control, and second to make Austria-Hungary inclined to Italy's leadership. As a result, this brewing was successful. On March 12, Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös arrived in Rome, and on the 13th, Austrian dictator Chancellor Dollfuss also arrived. The two met with Italy's Mussolini on the 14th at the Villa Chigi Palace in Rome. At this time, Mussolini's attitude was very clever. During the negotiations, he almost put aside political issues and focused on economics. On the 16th, the meeting yielded results, and on the 17th, their protocol was issued. The first protocol was a political statement by the three countries, which stated, "For the purpose of using existing treaties and friendly relations between the three countries as a standard, all issues, especially issues that are of interest to the three countries, or common issues, must be coordinated...for the purpose of promoting effective cooperation among the three countries..." There were two other protocols on economic issues, the content of which included, "Establishing the expansion of the current trade treaty between Italy and the other two countries, granting preferential treatment to Austrian industrial products, and based on the low price of grain, Italian and Austrian industries should reach an understanding to overcome Hungary's difficulties, and through the Adriatic Sea ports (namely, Fiume and Trieste), stipulate how to promote the transportation of goods..."</p>
<p>The political impact of this agreement is that, on the one hand, it completely shattered Germany's plan to annex Austria, and on the other hand, it has the intention of abrogating or amending the Treaty of Versailles, the Treaty of Trianon, and the Treaty of Saint-Germain, which has a serious relationship with the future of the European political situation. On the other hand, economically, Austria formerly had to export through Hamburg and Bremen through Germany, although the route was relatively long, it had no choice. Now that Italy has opened up the right to navigation in the Adriatic Sea to them, and Fiume and Trieste are precisely the ports that Austria and Hungary urgently want to obtain, this is Italy's foundation for establishing economic hegemony in Central Europe, and the prelude to the Central European dispute. Secondly, Italy, Austria, and Hungary have not closed the door, and also intend to attract the Danubian countries to join their organization. If this can really be formed, then the Little Entente will tend to Italy, and France's European hegemony will of course be hit, which is also very unfavorable to Germany, preventing its development.</p>
<p>According to the published documents, this agreement does not seem to have any intention of undermining the past international treaties, but rather wants to maintain them. However, this is ultimately a diplomatic courtesy. In practice, it still tries its best to exert its subtle skills to break the current situation in Europe, especially the League of Nations is threatened by this kind of sabotage. It cannot make Italy and the Danubian countries loyal to the League of Nations and fulfill international cooperation, nor can it promote the power of the League of Nations to pacify the inequalities of the small countries in Europe. Therefore, Germany and Italy each use their diplomatic means to win over small countries as satellites. In other words, it is to abandon the form of international conferences and turn to the struggle of vertical and horizontal alliances. (March 19, Paris)</p>

<h3 id="e107">Tianjin City: Rioters Seize Guns and Kill People; Five Gun-Grabbing Cases Occur in One Morning, One Police Officer Killed and One Policeman Injured <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: From midnight on the 24th to around 1 a.m. on the 25th, five cases of bandits robbing police officers of their firearms occurred simultaneously in the French Concession and the Nanshi district of Tianjin, and one police officer was shot and killed. Their actions seemed to be planned in advance. The bandits all fled into the Japanese Concession afterward, and spoke Japanese in a non-native accent when committing the crimes, leading some to suspect that they were plainclothes agents instigated by a certain party to deliberately disrupt Tianjin's security. The facts are described in detail below. At 0:50 a.m. on the 24th, police officer Shi Lifang of the Sixth Precinct of the First District of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, who was on duty in front of the Rong'an Street Hygiene Pond, suddenly saw two people, shabbily dressed and resembling workers, walking out of the Japanese Concession. Approaching Shi, they used a question as an excuse, and while the officer was unprepared, they grabbed him and dragged him into the Japanese Concession, taking his Mauser pistol and ordering him not to make a sound. They also ordered the officer to kneel against the wall. Officer Shi, unable to bear the insult, rose up to resist, and the two bandits struck him in the head with their gun butts, causing him to faint instantly. When Shi regained consciousness, the two bandits were gone. At that time, the road was quiet and there were few people. The officer staggered back to the station to report. Station Chief Tian Jiurong was about to lead his men out to pursue when he received a report from Patrol Captain Xue Peilu of the Fifth Outpost of the station, stating that police officer Liu Kuiqing, who was on duty on Fugui Street in the outpost, had also been shot in the chest by bandits. Tian immediately ordered him to be transported to the station. Shortly afterward, Officer Liu was carried in by people. According to [Liu], at approximately 1:20 a.m. on the 25th, two people suddenly walked out of the Japanese Concession, walked up to him, and one person suddenly grabbed Liu, while the other used force to seize the Mauser pistol Liu was wearing. Liu struggled, but the man fired the seized gun at Liu, hitting him in the chest and exiting through his back, causing him to faint immediately. The two bandits also fled immediately. After Station Chief Tian received reports of the two gun-grabbing incidents, he immediately reported by telephone to the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau and dispatched police officers to search for the bandits. At this time, he received a telephone report from the Fourth Outpost of the Haiguang Temple of the station, stating that at 1:30 a.m., two bandits had walked from the direction of the Haiguang Temple and fired two shots at the outpost, but did not hit anyone. By the time the outpost chief and police officers came out with guns, the bandits were gone. These three incidents occurred simultaneously within the jurisdiction of the Sixth Police Station of the Nanshi district. After receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau immediately ordered the Security Team to move out and patrol, and armored vehicles were sent out to patrol. Fortunately, nothing else happened afterward. Officer Shi, who was injured, was not seriously injured and is expected to recover in two or three days. Officer Liu was sent to the Municipal Hospital, and although he lost a lot of blood, he is still out of danger. The newly appointed Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau Chief Li Junxiang specially allocated 30 yuan yesterday for the officer's medical expenses and granted him a one-month leave for treatment.</p>
<p>While the above three incidents were occurring in the Nanshi district, Hua Police Officer No. 118, in front of No. 118 Sanhuai Lane behind the church in the Tianjin French Concession, was suddenly surrounded by three bandits, each wielding handguns and sharp knives. They threatened him and seized the officer's handgun, and then fled towards Mingde Fort in front of the church. The officer chased after them, blowing his whistle to warn others. At that time, Hua Police Officer Luo Fengzhang, No. 130, who was on duty in front of the church, heard the whistle and saw someone running frantically, and went forward to intercept them. He was shot twice by the bandits, one bullet hitting his head, and because it was a vital spot, he fell to the ground immediately. At this time, Hua Police Officer No. 93, No. 37, who was on duty at the entrance of the Lubei Chen Hotel, had also heard the alarm and was about to go to assist when he suddenly saw three people walking quickly on the sidewalk, speaking Japanese. The officer immediately raised his gun and questioned them. The three replied that they were going to find someone ahead. The officer did not suspect anything and continued to chase forward, but the three bandits suddenly turned around and grabbed the officer, snatched his handgun, and ran wildly towards the Japanese Concession. At this time, Hua Police Officer No. 85, who was on duty at No. 31, was also grabbed by two bandits, who seized his handgun and fled into Suma Street in the Japanese Concession. It is said that the bandits who seized the guns were all Chinese, deliberately speaking a broken Sino-Japanese language to avoid attracting attention. After the perpetrators fled into the Japanese Concession, it seemed that someone was waiting to assist them, so the authorities are paying close attention to this matter. Hua Police Officer Luo Fengzhang, No. 130, who was injured, died at 3 p.m. today due to his serious injuries. (25th)</p>

<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Xiamen and Taiwan are only a night's journey away by sea. From Magong in Taiwan to Xiamen, a destroyer can reach it in six hours. The same is true for Fuzhou. Therefore, the close relationship between Fujian and Taiwan and the large number of Japanese Taiwanese residing in Fuzhou and Xiamen form a special phenomenon. Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota recently summoned foreign ambassadors and consuls back to the country for training. The Japanese consuls in Fuzhou and Xiamen were also among those summoned. Takashi Tsukamoto, the Japanese consul in Xiamen, took the Phoenix Mountain Maru to Taiwan on April 10 and returned to Tokyo. According to recent news from Taiwan, the Governor-General of Taiwan, in view of the extremely close relationship between Taiwan and the other side, is eager to establish a policy towards South China. It has been decided to convene consuls from Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shanghai, Shantou, and Guangdong to Taiwan in late June to hold a consulate conference on the other side in the Governor-General's VIP room to discuss various important matters concerning the policy towards South China. This conference was originally scheduled to be held when the consuls from Fuzhou, Xiamen, etc. were passing through Taiwan from Tokyo, but due to the Taiwan Island Local Officials Conference in late April, and the fact that Taiwan Governor-General Nakagawa had to return to Tokyo on May 2 to discuss important matters with the Japanese government, it was decided to convene it after Nakagawa's return to Taiwan. The Governor-General's authorities had already drafted agreed-upon matters, but now, due to the gradual changes in the situation on the other side, the agenda will be revised again. Furthermore, the Taiwan Governor-General's Police Bureau held a conference of dispatch officers to the other side from April 12th to 14th. In conjunction with the consulate conference on the other side to be convened in June, the Taiwan authorities' emphasis on the situation on the other side is evident. The situation in South China is likely to become tense as a result. (April 25)</p>
<h3 id="e109">Bandit Suppression in Southern Fujian: Yu Sifu Executed; Garrison Announces Yu's Crimes <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Yu Sifu, a notorious bandit from Yongchun and former subordinate of the deceased militia leader Wu Wei, had over a decade of history with bandit militias in Fujian. He wreaked havoc in the areas of Yongchun, Dehua, Datian, Xingquan, and Yongjian, and his standing was comparable to that of Chen Guohui. Yu was recently apprehended in Yongchun by Song Xilian, the commander of the 36th Division and concurrent garrison commander of Quanzhou. His troops were disarmed, and Song ordered his on-the-spot execution to eliminate a scourge of the people. The execution was carried out at approximately 5:00 PM on the 20th of this month by the 106th Brigade Headquarters stationed in Yongchun, in compliance with the order.</p>
<p>Those executed along with Yu were his accomplices Yu Chang, Yu Quan, Chen Derong, and Xu Jie, totaling five individuals. Before the execution, Yu and the others were escorted from the regimental headquarters to the brigade headquarters (the brigade headquarters had relocated from Quanzhou to Yongchun on the 20th). Standing in the courtyard, Brigade Commander Li Liangrong individually inquired about the names of the bandits. Yu immediately said, "I have not done anything wrong. Please, Brigade Commander, investigate thoroughly." Li replied, "I have already investigated and understand clearly. Justice will prevail, and history will prove it." Upon finishing his words, he ordered them to be taken out and executed. Yu Sifu was a native of Funei in Yongchun. He started as a peddler and then entered the greenwoods, where his influence grew daily. In 1928, he served as a brigade commander in the newly organized army, enjoying a period of prominence. He had eight or nine wives and concubines. In August 1929, he was wanted by the provincial government and fled to Datian. His wives, concubines, and servants gradually dispersed. He currently has four wives and concubines. The announcement from the An'nan Yong Border Area Bandit Suppression Command of the 106th Brigade Headquarters is recorded as follows: "Upon investigation, the notorious bandit Yu Sifu and his accomplices Yu Yongchang, Yu Quan, Chen Derong, and Xu Jie have wreaked havoc in the jurisdictions of Yongde and Datian for more than ten years. Numerous complaints have been filed by the people of various counties, piling up like mountains. In 1929, the provincial government issued a reward for their capture. Yu and his gang then fled to Datian. During this campaign against the rebels, Yu again seized the opportunity to come to Yongchun, gathered his followers, occupied the western district, openly engaged in opium and gambling, and extorted money, robbed, and murdered without restraint. We have already detained and disarmed his subordinates. Yu and his gang were also captured on the spot. We have now received an order from Garrison Commander Song to verify the identities of Yu Sifu, Yu Yongchang, Yu Quan, Chen Derong, and Xu Jie and execute them by shooting. In addition to complying with the order, this announcement is made for general knowledge. This announcement." (April 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e110">Fujian Provincial Government Grants Communists Amnesty, Sets Two-Month Deadline to Surrender <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The 4th Regiment of the Military Police stationed in Fujian uncovered Communist provincial and municipal party headquarters, mutual aid societies, transportation offices, printing presses, the Communist Youth League, and the Anti-Imperialist League in Fuzhou and Xiamen. They arrested more than thirty individuals, including Chen Zhishu, Ni Shigeng, and Guo Bizhen, who held positions such as pseudo-provincial committee secretary, municipal committee secretary, and members. All were granted amnesty to repent and start anew. A special training class was established by the Security Office, and they were sent to study. The course was completed in two months, and they were assigned appropriate jobs. Classes began the day before yesterday. Considering that many Communist members are still in hiding, the provincial government issued an announcement yesterday granting them amnesty if they surrender to the government within two months. The original text is as follows: "According to a report from the 4th Regiment of the Military Police, Chen Zhishu and others, who were recently captured as Communist members, confessed that there are many remaining members who are currently on the run. I propose that Your Excellency publish an announcement in the newspaper granting amnesty to all remaining members who are on the run, in order to save young people who have strayed from the right path and to encourage them to return voluntarily." After investigation, it is found that these remaining members on the run are all weak-willed and have strayed from the right path. While the law cannot tolerate them, their situation is indeed pitiable. If they are allowed to remain in exile, they will inevitably face a dead end with no way to extract themselves. The regiment commander requests that this government publish an announcement granting them amnesty, which should be approved. Therefore, this announcement is hereby made. All remaining members on the run must be aware that they must awaken as soon as possible and resolutely return. Within two months, they must submit a signed pledge of surrender, attach a photo of themselves, and a declaration renouncing communism, and report to this government. Their past actions may then be forgiven, and they will be granted amnesty. They will be educated according to their abilities and procedures, so that they may become useful individuals. If they continue to be deluded and unrepentant after the deadline, they will be wanted by name."</p>

<h3 id="e111">Northwest Inspection Report: Special Correspondent Geng Ya <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Observations on the Rise and Fall of Baotou Commerce.  Suiyuan, 14th. I went to the train station at 11:00 AM. The train from the east was delayed by about three hours. Mr. Mou Pengling, Bai Xuchu, and others came to see me off. They insisted on returning before the train arrived. The station was flat and filled with people waiting for the train. Many women had bound feet, with red shoes and green trim. The ancient saying "lotus hooks," "three inches," is not an exaggeration. I wanted to step forward and persuade them to liberate themselves first and not inflict this torture on their children, but I felt it was inappropriate in a foreign land, so I hesitated. I saw an old woman leading a group of children, strolling leisurely. One girl in a red jacket, about seven or eight years old, also had bound feet and walked with difficulty, as if in great pain. I asked the old woman, "How can you bear to do this?" She replied, "She (the girl in the red jacket) is a local. I advised her not to bind her feet, but her parents wouldn't allow it. There's nothing I can do. I am from Tanggu. I came here with my husband who works for the railway. I am only fifty years old, but my feet are often cold because they were bound. That's why I don't allow my granddaughters to suffer this living hell." Promoting foot binding release for more than twenty years, and yet seven or eight year old girls have not escaped this misery. No wonder foreigners traveling to the Northwest often take films of men with queues and women with bound feet, labeling them as inferior people. Can those who have a responsibility to guide society continue to turn a blind eye?</p>
<p>The train departed at 4:00 PM. To the north, the Daqing Mountains stood side by side. To the south, the vast expanse of the earth stretched without end. Occasionally, there were deep pits and ditches, with alternating layers of sand and soil, forming symmetrical multi-layered patterns. The ice in the Daqing Mountains had not melted, hanging like white silk. At the Taige Mu, Bikeqi, and Salachi stations, I saw soldiers with disheveled clothes and hats, mixed with many muleteers and laborers. I knew they were soldiers from Sun Dianying's disbanded army. When the train stopped before reaching the station platform, women with bound feet found it very difficult to get off. Railway police helped them down, and they hurried away, not daring to look up. Outside the station, coachmen competed to greet passengers. They rode skillfully, but walked unsteadily. The people of the north are strong and good riders, and even women are no exception. If they did not bind their feet, wouldn't it further enhance their health and beauty?</p>
<p>The road gradually approached the Hetao region. The fields on both sides, with mountain springs to the north and canals to the south, were incomparably fertile. Where there were villages, there were also many trees. The fields were connected by footpaths, and the ditches crisscrossed. Farmers drove oxen to plow the fields, engaging in spring plowing. Further from the villages, the ground was fish-scale-like, covered with weeds and overgrown with vegetation, as if it had been cultivated and then abandoned. The train traveled for dozens of miles, and the view remained vast and endless. It is a pity to abandon the land.</p>
<p>I arrived in Baotou at 10:00 PM. Two or three miles into the city, young men carried luggage on their backs, using hemp ropes tightly pressed against their shoulders. It was clear that they were not strong enough, and carrying the luggage was unnatural. However, they were afraid that their business would be taken by others, so they struggled to move forward. Before they had gone a few hundred steps, sweat was pouring down their faces in the cold weather. If they could change from carrying to using a carrying pole, it might reduce their labor. The city gate was closed, but opened again when we called. Several guards did not inspect us. The streets were narrow, uneven, and unkempt. Dust flew in our faces, and the electric lights were dim. I stayed at the Taian Inn. The room next door was occupied by a demobilization office of a certain unit. Demobilized officers, their families stranded here, were forced by circumstances to wait to return east and came to collect their demobilization pay so they could leave tomorrow. However, the office was waiting for verification and was not willing to issue the payments immediately, causing a disturbance that lasted until dawn.</p>
<p>The earthen city of Baotou was built in the Tongzhi era and was nineteen miles in circumference. It was originally a town in Salachi County. In 1923, a governance bureau was established, and in 1926, it was changed to a county. It is located eight miles north of the Yellow River, at the end of the PingSui Railway, with convenient water and land transportation. Goods from Tianjin, Shaanxi, Gansu, Inner and Outer Mongolia all gathered and dispersed here. It is extremely important militarily and commercially. In the spring of 1933, a preparatory office for the municipal government was established. However, due to the lack of a comprehensive plan for the new municipal government's finances, it has not yet been established. The total area of the county is 47,400 square miles, with a population of over 17,300 households, totaling about 70,000 people. About 20,000 to 30,000 people live in the city. At the beginning of the establishment of the county, the business of various merchants was thriving, showing a trend of rapid progress. However, later, due to (1) the independence of Outer Mongolia, (2) the blockage of the western route, (3) the depreciation of Jin currency, and (4) the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, business suffered a huge blow, and business plummeted. Bankruptcies and closures were heard of daily. The rise and fall of various businesses in Baotou is specially inquired about from the Chamber of Commerce and listed as follows:</p>

<p>(Note) "Wholesale Stores" refers to wholesale dealers; "Mongolian Goods" refers to businesses specializing in trade with Mongolians.</p>
<p>Since the independence of Outer Mongolia, the Mongolian goods business has declined from 500 businesses to only 11. Currently, in addition to doing business with Inner Mongolia, they are also secretly trading with Outer Mongolians, which is called "stealing," but the profits are limited, and there is always the risk of being caught and confiscated. Therefore, although there are many reasons for the decline of Baotou's commerce, the severance of relations with Outer Mongolia is indeed the biggest fatal blow. This is not only the case in Baotou, but also in the ports along the PingSui Line, such as Zhangjiakou and GuiSui. However, Baotou has the advantage of being the hub of water and land transportation in the Northwest, and it is also the source of development in the Northwest. At this time of developing the Northwest and starting construction, all needs must rely on Baotou for supply, and future production will also rely on Baotou for export. The future holds great promise, and it is not only easy to restore the prosperity of a few years ago, but it can even reach the prosperity of Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan. If the local officials and merchants can unite and work together towards the goal of construction, then success will be within reach. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e112">Jiangxi Province: Guangchang Imminent; Bandit Suppression Army Very Close to Guangchang County; Bandit Stronghold on the Border of Xinfeng About to Be Captured <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The bandit suppression in Jiangxi Province has been achieving victories recently. The recovery of bandit areas, the construction of roads, the construction of blockhouses, the reception of refugees, and the organization of the people have all been completed. Recently, our army has advanced towards the bandit stronghold in Guangchang, consolidating and building as it advances. Since the offensive, we have captured dangerous passes one after another. Yesterday, Division Commander Xiao Zhiping telegraphed that his division captured Yunji Village and Guanfu Ridge on the 22nd, defeating the pseudo-35th Army Corps, seizing more than 200 guns. The bandits' fighting power has been lost, and they are fleeing at the sight of our troops. Our vanguard is only ten miles away from Guangchang City. Our army will advance again after clearing and recovering the remaining bandits in various places. Guangchang City will be captured soon. In addition, Nanfeng County Chief Liao Guoping recently telegraphed the provincial government, saying that our army has advanced to Shazi Ridge, and Guangchang County is within sight. From now on, cooperation in suppression and post-war reconstruction is eagerly awaited. The military authorities are entrusting Nanfeng to handle all matters related to bandit suppression in the territory of Guangchang, but due to the distance and complexity of the matters, it is feared that there may be delays, which may delay military opportunities. It is proposed that the newly appointed Guangchang County Magistrate Liu be ordered to take over as soon as possible to facilitate the advancement of the suppression.</p>
<p>Fengcheng News: Beishan, on the border of Xinfeng, was originally a stronghold of the Red Bandits. Since the large-scale encirclement and suppression by the five counties last year, the bandits have scattered. However, due to the dangerous mountain roads, the army adopted a steady approach and did not conduct a thorough search. However, the bandits hiding in the mountains did not dare to move. Recently, due to the shortage of supplies, the bandits sent people down the mountain to purchase food. The people reported this to the 3rd Security Regiment stationed there, which surrounded the area at dawn on the 19th. The officers and soldiers bravely advanced, and the remaining bandits had no resistance. More than 100 people were captured on the spot, and more than 30 rifles and countless other bandit supplies were seized. The bandits looked emaciated.</p>
<p>Their hardship can be imagined. After this bandit den is broken, it can be said to be the removal of a hidden danger for Xinfeng and other counties.</p>
<p>Le'an News: Our army is actively engaged in the construction of motor roads in the recovered bandit areas to facilitate transportation. It is learned that the 27th Division stationed in Le'an is particularly diligent in road construction. Previously, the road from Le'an to Lugang was reinforced with gravel, so that automobiles can travel smoothly without hindrance, even in rainy weather. More than 10,000 saplings have been planted along the road, and all are now in full bloom with green leaves. Recently, in order to expand the bandit area, the 79th Brigade and directly subordinate units have been sent to build the motor road from Le'an to Zengtian. Although there have been heavy rains recently, the officers and soldiers are still working hard to build the road as usual. The project is expected to be completed within a few days. (April 26th)</p>

<p>Zhou Jingqiu, the manager of the Yonghe Bank in Dongting Dongshan, was suddenly kidnapped on the 21st of this month. Subsequently, the water police arrested three suspects who contacted him about the ransom and sent them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Zhou Jingqiu was released on the 27th. He was taken to the district by the police en route to inquire about the kidnapping, but Zhou was evasive.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Some Rickshaw Pullers Have Resumed Work <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The general strike of rickshaw pullers in Suzhou has lasted for three days. After the party and government organs decided on a solution and strictly investigated the instigators, Shen Weiyang, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, saw that some rickshaw pullers had resumed work on the afternoon of the 27th, but were still being blocked. He went to Huaiyang Road outside the Shantangmen Gate at 6:00 AM on the 28th, accompanied by an inspector from the Third Branch Bureau, to persuade the rickshaw pullers who lived there to resume work. Most of them complied and resumed work. However, some striking rickshaw pullers went around blocking, beating the working rickshaw pullers. At the same time, they also coerced the horse-drawn carriage drivers to join the strike. When the horse-drawn carriage drivers refused, their carriages were destroyed. Chief Shen immediately led the police to arrest Ni Hesong and Jiang Erwangzi, the leaders, outside the Xu Gate, and Chen Xuejin, a rickshaw puller in western attire, on Huaiyang Road, who was suspected of inciting the strike. They were immediately sent to the headquarters for strict interrogation. The Public Security Bureau has decided to take strict measures against rickshaw pullers who prevent others from resuming work. However, yesterday, about 1,000 rickshaw pullers resumed work in the city.</p>

<p>After Station Master Zhuang of Suzhou Station was reported by the railway police for releasing a major criminal who smuggled raw materials for opium pills, the Railway Administration detained Station Master Zhuang and sent officials to investigate and verify the facts. The Ministry of Railways also attaches great importance to this case and has ordered the Railway Bureau to send Station Master Zhuang to Nanchang Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Changshu: The Rent Collection Office Is Closed <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Last winter, the farmers in various villages owed a large amount of rent to various landlords, so the landlords specially requested the county to strictly pursue the rent. The county government then established a rent collection office at this time, appointing Xu Chunian as the director, specializing in handling the rent affairs between landlords and tenants, resulting in all farmers who were unable to pay the rent being detained. As a result, there were three to four hundred people detained in the detention center. Now that the busy farming season has arrived, and the spring harvest is about to begin, the county government, in order not to harm agricultural affairs, closed the rent collection office. However, the farmers who are still in detention have not yet completed their payment, so on the afternoon of the 27th, Director Xu gathered the rent collectors to the county to announce the following two points: (1) The public servants are required to bail out the detained tenants within one week. (2) The public servants are responsible for paying the tenants' outstanding meal expenses in detention. However, the public servants seemed reluctant. Finally, they expressed the opinion that it would be impossible for them to be responsible for the meal expenses and that they should be collected from the local servants. Director Xu agreed to consider this.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Wuxi: The Replacement for the Chief of the Public Security Bureau Has Been Found <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Li Wengong, the chief of the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau, resigned and went to Shanghai after the Gu Li Shuyun case and the resignation of Gu Renfa, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs. All duties were temporarily performed by Chief Inspector Zhang Yu. The provincial government meeting has now approved the appointment of Chen Yuchu to fill the vacancy. Chen is from Hangzhou County, Zhejiang Province, and has served as the director of the Nanjing Municipal Police Department and the chief of the Accounting Section of the Bureau of Finance. He recently came south from Peiping and arrived in Zhenjiang the day before yesterday. After being appointed, he will make arrangements and come to Wuxi to take up his new post at the beginning of the month.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Provincial Governor: Active Improvement of Toll Calls <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Since the Department of Construction has actively developed toll calls in Jiangsu Province, there has been special progress. In the past year, the original twelve counties including Nanjing have been expanded to the counties north of the Yangtze River, making transportation between the north and south of the Yangtze River increasingly convenient. Recently, Director Shen of the Department of Construction found that the old regulations for provincial long-distance calls in various counties were no longer applicable, so he drafted new regulations and distributed them to the counties, which will be implemented from May 5th. Fees will be charged according to the new regulations in the future. There have also been many improvements in other areas. The calls are divided into six types: official calls, ordinary calls, urgent calls, scheduled calls, news calls, and special official calls. In addition, there have been many changes in the application methods and transmission methods. New regulations have been formulated for the upper fees. The prices for ordinary calls have been revised as follows: From Wuxi to Jiangyin, Wu County, and Wujin, 30 cents; Changshu and Yixing, 40 cents; Liyang, Danyang, and Jintan, 60 cents; Jurong and Lishui, 80 cents; Zhenjiang, 65 cents; Nanjing, 95 cents. The fees for delivering telephone calls are particularly low. The Wuxi township telephone areas that are connected to long-distance calls include Tangqiao, Nanfangquan, Daqiangmen, Houzhai, Dangkou, Zhangshe, Xinqiao, Anzhen, Houqiao, Yanjiaqiao, Zhajiaqiao, Xingtang, Zhangjingqiao, Zhaimen, Donghudang, Huangtutang, Chenshu, Wangzhuang, Yangjian, Huai, Yangyuan, and Xueyanqiao, a total of twenty-two towns.</p>

<p>Since last month, the weather in the county has been cold, and residents have had to wear cotton clothes. The cold weather has been even worse in recent days. Yesterday (the 28th), it rained, and the temperature dropped to 63 degrees. In previous years, people had to wear single clothes on this day. Therefore, the sprouting of mulberry leaves in the countryside has been very slow. They are now only the size of copper coins. There is a saying in the county that "silk worms will have white heads three days after Grain Rain." Grain Rain has now passed for a week, but the silk worms have not yet begun to spin cocoons. If the weather remains cold, they will still not be able to spin cocoons in the coming days. Therefore, the silkworm farming in this season has been delayed by ten days.</p>

<p>The Zhencheng Road project is vast and has taken two years to complete. The roadbed is now gradually being completed in various sections. However, the soil is very loose and cannot be covered with gravel immediately, so vehicles must travel over it for several months, and it must sink at least five inches below the new construction level before it can be stable. Therefore, after the road is completed, trial runs must be conducted at the end of May, and gravel must be paved again in mid-July. The full road opening ceremony must be held on June 15th, when the Seven-Province Transportation Exhibition opens, and will be held in Zhenjiang by Committee Chairman Jiang and others.</p>

<p>Regarding the regulations on foreign churches renting land in the interior and issuing permanent lease licenses, the provincial land bureau had previously ordered the Zhenjiang County Land Bureau to follow them. However, the foreign properties in the former British concession in Zhenjiang should be registered and licensed by the county land bureau for inventory purposes after the Qing Dynasty. However, before handling this, it must be clarified whether permanent lease contracts were exchanged in accordance with the Sino-British exchange of notes when the concession was recovered in 1919, how many households there are, and whether the permanent leases have expired. All of these should be investigated separately for reference. Yesterday, the county land bureau was ordered to investigate and report the above-mentioned items separately as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Shayao River in Zhenjiang has been actively underway since it started construction. According to the report from Director Lin of the Engineering Office, the project is divided into three sections, and the middle and north sections will be completed by the end of the month. The south section will be completed later, but it will also be completed in a few days. After that, more than 80,000 mu of farmland in the area will be able to enjoy water conservancy and obtain more harvests. The Zhencheng Road has been expedited since it was ordered to be built. The fourth district has already been contracted to build the road, and it can be completed by the end of the month. The section of the first district near the city will be contracted out, and it is estimated that more than 12,000 yuan will be needed. Director Shen has agreed to allocate 8,000 yuan, and another 4,000 yuan will be raised from the county construction funds. Construction will begin soon. However, the first district is the most difficult because 20 to 30 ponds need to be filled, which will have a great impact on the irrigation of farmers. If the soil is excavated from the farmland next to the ponds, the losses of the people will be even more unbearable. It has now been decided to avoid excavating soil from the farmland next to the ponds, and if it is absolutely necessary, only inferior fields will be excavated, and a request will be submitted to exempt the Jeng rice and issue land prices to reduce the losses of the people.</p>

<p>(1) Tang Xiaodi, a resident of Qianyao Town in the county, married Liang, and they had children. The family was poor. Two years ago, he borrowed 100 yuan from his wife's younger sister. Over the years, his wife's younger sister repeatedly demanded the debt from her brother-in-law, so Xiaodi beat her severely. Fortunately, others persuaded them, and she was rescued. Unexpectedly, Xiaodi went home and insulted his wife Liang. Liang was filled with resentment and jumped into the river last night and committed suicide. (2) Xu Jiesan, a resident of Luxu Town, married Jiang Zheng and had only one daughter, Aibao, who had just reached the age of fifteen. This spring, a relative acted as a matchmaker and betrothed her to someone with the surname Xi in Xitang. Jiang negotiated and agreed, but Jiesan did not agree. Later, when Jiesan found out, he was very displeased and scolded Jiang, causing Jiang to become angry and inconsolable. She committed suicide by hanging herself behind people's backs.

A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Chu at the Sino-French Institute of Technology and inquired about the arrival of Tibetan representatives in Beijing and the Panchen Lama's entry into Tibet. The conversation proceeded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e133">Anqin Brings a Personal Letter from the Dalai Lama <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>According to the discussion, Tibetan representatives led by Anqin, a group of fifty-seven people, had arrived in Shanghai on the Jisheng Wheel on the 23rd and entered Beijing, where they paid respects to President Wang and others, and reported in detail on the Tibetan situation. Anqin and his delegation had brought with them a personal letter from the Dalai Lama to the Panchen Lama. As the Dalai Lama was still alive when Anqin and his party left Tibet, he personally wrote the letter and entrusted it to Anqin to deliver to the Panchen Lama. The contents of the letter are unknown in detail, but it is understood that the general meaning is to welcome the Panchen Lama to return to Tibet as soon as possible. Anqin and his party are currently staying in Beijing, awaiting the Panchen Lama's return from Hangzhou to Beijing before discussing the matter in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Dai Jitao to Visit Hangzhou Soon <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, went to the Northwest last month to inspect construction in Shaanxi and Gansu. He has already returned to Nanjing and is scheduled to attend the National Government Memorial Week on the 30th to report on the findings of his inspection trip. It is understood that Dai will travel to Hangzhou by car along the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway after the Memorial Week to participate in the Kalachakra initiation ceremony. After the ceremony concludes, he will return to Nanjing with the Panchen Lama to discuss Tibetan issues with the Tibetan representatives, as Dai is said to have a relatively clear understanding of Tibetan matters.</p>
<h3 id="e135">All Circles in Tibet Welcome the Panchen Lama <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The reporter continued, noting that the Tibetan people and the Dalai Lama, before his death, also strongly advocated welcoming the Panchen Lama to return to Tibet as soon as possible. He asked if the Panchen Lama's entry into Tibet could be realized soon. The response was that at present, all levels of Tibetan society welcome the Panchen Lama to return to Tibet as soon as possible to preside over Tibetan affairs. The Panchen Lama's attitude is unknown, but this matter will be decided after the Panchen Lama returns to Nanjing from Hangzhou and consults with the central authorities and Tibetan representatives. Huang Musong, a special envoy sent by the central government to Tibet, has already departed for Sichuan and will enter Tibet via that route to preside over the Dalai Lama's funeral and investigate Tibetan affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Four Meetings on the Construction of Xinjiang <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the work of the Xinjiang Construction Committee, Chu Minyi told the reporter that the committee had held four general meetings, with the guidance of Chief Judge Luo and President Wang. It has now been decided to convene separate meetings of the construction, culture, industry, and transportation subcommittees to discuss their respective agendas. A fifth general meeting will then be held to submit the results of the subcommittee meetings for discussion. The results will then be transferred to the relevant authorities for implementation to the best of their ability, so that the construction of Xinjiang can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Kong Xiangxi to Return to Nanjing Soon <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Chu finally mentioned that Huang Yingbai, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Political Reorganization Committee in Beiping, is currently residing in Moganshan, and the date of his return north is undecided. The Executive Yuan hopes that he will return north soon. As for Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, he has visited Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other provinces to inspect the financial situation of those provinces and use it as a reference for reorganization. He will be returning to Nanjing soon. As for the issue of abolishing the two agencies in the Southwest, there has been no recent news. Chu plans to stay in Shanghai for two or three days before returning to Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Strange Warship Opens Fire in Changshu; Navy Has Not Received Report; Jiankang Warship Docked in Nantong Will Surely Clarify in the Future <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, two strange warships fired two live rounds while passing Gao Pu Kou in Changshu. The shells landed in farmland. At the same time, residents along the river heard machine gun fire, which lasted for half an hour. Yesterday, the reporter inquired with both the Chinese and Japanese sides in Mupu. According to the Japanese consulate, the naval landing party has not received any news of warships firing artillery near Changshu. The Chinese navy stated that there must be a prior notification for any foreign ships to conduct live fire tests along the river. They also stated that they have not received confirmation of the foreign ship firing in Changshu. The nationality of the warship is even more unclear. The reporter further inquired about the situation of Laoshusha and the stationing of Chinese warships along the river. It was said that there were many floating markers along the Changshu riverfront, and the river surface was very narrow. The beaches, such as Laoshusha Baimaosha, are numerous. Although the Jiankang warship is currently docked in Nantong, the Langshan mountain screens the view from the Nantong riverfront directly to the Changshu riverfront, and even the sound of artillery fire cannot be transmitted. Therefore, before it can be proven whether this event occurred, it will surely be clarified in the future. As Nantong is the throat of the Yangtze River, any foreign ships entering or leaving will be clearly visible and easy to identify. The inscriptions on the shells will provide a general indication. As for piracy, the area from Nantong to the Changshu riverfront has traditionally been peaceful because there are many beaches and few islands, leaving pirates with nowhere to hide. Moreover, it would be sufficient to deal with bandits with machine guns. There is no need to use artillery bombardment.</p>
<h3 id="e139">International Problems Research Association's Opinion on Japan's Statement: Absurd and Unreasonable, Attempting to Monopolize China, No Foreigners Allowed to Usurp Rights in Establishing National Defense <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Since the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an informal statement on Sino-Japanese relations on the 17th of this month, it has caused a great international reaction. Our government has also issued two statements refuting it. Recently, the International Problems Research Association issued the following opinion on Japan's statement:</p>
<p>Wanting to Monopolize ChinaOn the 17th of this month, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on China, seemingly acting as the sole protector of East Asia and treating our country as if it were its vassal state. All matters of international cooperation with us, even those of a technical nature without any political implications, are being opposed. Japan's statement believes that "After the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents, any joint action taken by foreign countries, even in the name of technical or financial assistance, naturally contains political implications..."</p>
<p>"In principle, we must oppose such undertakings." Today, Japan stubbornly insists that "technical or financial cooperation naturally contains political implications." Regardless of whether such a statement has the suspicion of overstepping boundaries and interfering in the internal affairs of neighboring countries, its overbearing attitude is filled with political implications. Japan is using the excuse of not wanting the great powers to jointly manage China in order to monopolize and annex China.</p>
<p>Unlimited AmbitionPreviously, Japan only shamelessly claimed that the three northeastern provinces were its special sphere of influence. Since the "September 18th" incident, relying on its aggressive and brutal means, it has seized our Northeast and is now insatiably seeking to dominate East Asia and fulfill its Monroe Doctrine in East Asia. Today's statement declares its desire to "fulfill its special responsibilities in East Asia." Tomorrow, why can't it go further and wildly claim to fulfill its responsibilities in the Pacific, or even the world?</p>
<p>Exceeding the Twenty-One DemandsThe current statement by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs represents the ambitions of its militarism. At the beginning of the European War, the European and American powers had no time to look east. Japan believed that a good opportunity was rare and thus presented us with the Twenty-One Demands. Today's crisis in the international situation is indeed like the eve of the outbreak of the European War, and the content of Japan's current statement is a reiteration of the spirit of the demands made in the fourth year of the Republic. The most alarming of the Twenty-One Demands was the "Fifth Item," which aimed to take over China's military and national defense. Today's statement says, "As for supplying China with military aircraft, building airfields in China, dispatching military training officers or military advisors to China, or raising loans to supply funds for political purposes, it is clearly possible...to disrupt the peace and order of East Asia. Japan will oppose such actions." These words are not only consistent, but also exceed the rigid demands of the Twenty-One Demands. Then, Japan advocated taking over China's military and national defense. Now, it forces the great powers not to cooperate with China. While its words are divided into passive and active, its purpose is the same.</p>
<p>Absurd and ContradictoryNational defense construction is a right that an independent country should have, and no other country can interfere. The Japanese army can occupy neighboring countries' land and prepare for offensive and aggressive military actions, while China alone cannot consciously engage in defensive and self-defense national defense construction on its own territory. Cuckoos occupy magpie nests, and guests usurp the role of the host. Can any nation with blood not bristle with anger? Japan's statement also says, "Japan earnestly desires the unification of China, the preservation of China's territorial integrity, and the restoration of order within China." It is perplexing to read this. Has Japan forgotten that it used force to destroy China's territorial integrity not long ago, seizing our four northeastern provinces and occupying them to this day?</p>
<h3 id="e140">Iwai, Representative of the Japanese Embassy's Information Bureau, Issues a Statement: Completely Fallacious and Dogmatic, Attempting to Cover Up <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, since Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota issued an informal statement opposing the League of Nations' technical cooperation with China, all countries in the world have condemned Japan's actions as arrogant and will unite to deal with Japan. They also pointed out that Japan's actions not only violate the Nine-Power Treaty but also disrupt world peace. In light of the increasingly deteriorating international sentiment, Iwai Eiichi, the representative of the Japanese Embassy's Information Bureau, issued a statement, resorting to sophistry and trying to confuse the world's hearing. Here is a record of it:</p>
<h3 id="e141">Opposing the League of Nations' Investment in China <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>According to Iwai Eiichi, if the League of Nations invests in China with a pure attitude while upholding the principles of equal opportunity and open doors, Japan will naturally sympathize with it. However, the current investment of the League of Nations in China is actually being diverted to military and political purposes. This move will actually promote internal strife in China. Japan has the responsibility to maintain peace in East Asia and must oppose it.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Declaring the Intent of the Hirota Declaration <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>As for Japan's intention, it is to hope that China can achieve the goal of peaceful unification in order to achieve coexistence and co-prosperity between China and Japan. However, China's attitude is the opposite. Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota specifically issued an informal statement to warn the League of Nations. Unfortunately, some points in the statement were not noted, causing misunderstandings in various countries. Therefore, he is issuing another statement today to explain.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Accusing China of Having an Inappropriate Attitude <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Kishii continued to translate, saying that China actually took this opportunity to abandon its past pro-Japanese rhetoric, incite anti-Japanese sentiment, and instigate countries around the world to oppose Japan. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructed the ambassadors to the United States and the United Kingdom to contact the United States and the United Kingdom separately to promote full cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom, and to convene a meeting of the nine signatory countries in England or the United States on May 15 to pressure Japan. This move is extremely inappropriate.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Using Pretexts to Frighten the Chinese Government <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese government remains calm on the surface at this juncture to avoid arousing public resentment and provoking Japan's anger. However, the Chinese government still does not abandon its policy of "using barbarians to control barbarians" to undermine peace in East Asia. If any problems arise in the future, this responsibility should be borne by China.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Denying Rumors of Personnel Changes at the Japanese Embassy <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Iwai also said that rumors of changes in the Japanese Ambassador to China after his return home to report on Sino-Japanese issues to Foreign Minister Hirota are not true. Reports that Consul General Suma, stationed in Nanjing, came to Shanghai from Nanjing on the order of Foreign Minister Hirota to explain Japan's statement to the consuls of various countries in Shanghai to avoid misunderstandings are also not true. Suma has always been in Nanjing and has not set foot in Shanghai.</p>

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the term of office of the second executive and supervisory committee of the Shanghai General Labor Union has expired. With the approval of the municipal party headquarters, a representative assembly was convened yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the union's auditorium to hold the third re-election. Committee member Lu Jingshi was sent by the municipal party headquarters to supervise the election and passed several important proposals. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Attending Representatives <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>

Committee member Lu Jingshi was sent by the municipal party headquarters to provide guidance, and Boy Scouts from the shipbuilding union in District 5 maintained order at the venue.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Staff and Order <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The staff of the assembly were as follows: Chairman Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Li Mengnan; Secretary-General Shao Xubai; Recorder Fang Rusheng; Master of Ceremonies Li Hua; Hosts Ye Xianggai, Lu Jiyun, Fan Yifeng, Zhang Linhua, Liu Xinquan, Zhou Qigui, Zhang Zhuyun, Lu Gan. The order was as follows: (1) All stand at attention, (2) Pay the highest respect to the national flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, (3) The chairman reads Sun Yat-sen's last will and testament, (4) The chairman reports, (5) The representative of the municipal party headquarters delivers a speech, (6) Elect the third executive and supervisory committees, (7) Discuss proposals, (8) Motions from the floor, (9) Adjournment.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Chairman's Report <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Zhu Xuefan gave a report, saying that the association had been established for three years. The term of office of the second executive and supervisory committee has expired, so the re-election is held today. Recalling the past work, it has not been possible to fully develop due to economic limitations, but fortunately there has been no failure. This is something to be comforted about. At this time of industrial and commercial decline and serious unemployment, the association's responsibility is even greater in the future. I hope everyone will pay attention to the candidates for the third committee. The large number of representatives attending today is full of new spirit, proving that the pace of our workers is consistent and unanimous, and we are working hard for the country and seeking liberation for our fellow workers.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Party Committee Delivers Instructions <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Next, the representative of the municipal party headquarters, Committee member Lu Jingshi, delivered instructions, saying that the General Labor Union has achieved good results in the past for the party and the country, such as rescuing Northeast refugees, comforting anti-Japanese soldiers, raising funds for the Shanghai Worker Aircraft, running worker night schools, establishing summer clinics, and recently organizing the citywide workers' sports meet. All of these have been carried out diligently and are deeply commendable. However, due to legal restrictions, it has not been possible to obtain the qualification of a legal entity, but it is urgently needed by workers throughout the city. Therefore, the municipal party headquarters has approved the filing, so today's General Labor Union is already a legal entity, and work will be smoother in the future. Under the guidance of the party, it is hoped that attention will be paid to the following matters: (1) Unify the city's labor movement and consolidate the basic front, (2) Implement labor-management cooperation and speed up production, (3) Strive for literacy movements (4) Promote the New Life Movement (5) Vigorously implement military-national training.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Elected Committee Members <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>

<p>The rice industry firms and factories in Zhabei believe that the municipal government's notice on the 24th of this month, based on the Social Affairs Bureau's continued presentation, to implement seven measures for the wharf rice transportation method, and to prepare for the organization of a Hui Gong business association, is slightly inconsistent with the method agreed upon by the Social Affairs Bureau on January 5 of this year, and the Hui Gong expenses are also difficult to bear. Yesterday, they sent representatives with a petition to the municipal government, requesting a postponement of implementation.</p>

<p>States That the Trip Was Fruitful</p>
<p>Gu Xin-yi, chairman of the Shanghai Bean, Rice, and Grain Trade Association, recognizing that the Ministry of Finance imposed import duties on foreign rice and wheat on December 16th of last year, while Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces had not yet implemented them, resulting in continued dumping of foreign rice, low rice prices, and a significant impact on rural areas, went to Nanjing to present his views to Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei. He then proceeded to Nanchang to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Having completed his mission, he returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. A reporter from the Dagong News Agency interviewed Mr. Gu yesterday. According to Mr. Gu, his visit to Jiangxi to petition Chairman Chiang Kai-shek included requests for (1) unified foreign rice tax, (2) reduction of flour business tax, and (3) matters concerning the Eight Provinces Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek adopted each suggestion, making the result very satisfactory. Detailed information will be provided after receiving an official reply.</p>

<p>Lieutenant General Bullardman to Inspect U.S. Troops</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that Lieutenant General Bullardman of the U.S. Army, recently arrived in Shanghai from the United States, initially believed he would be stationed in China for two years. However, General Bullardman recently received orders from the government, informing him that this visit to the East is in the nature of an inspection tour of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in the East. Therefore, General Bullardman will inspect the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai and Beiping. Before returning to the United States, he may also visit Manila to inspect the troops there. Due to unfavorable weather conditions, the 4th Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai cannot be inspected. Therefore, General Bullardman plans to go to Beiping for inspection early next week, and return to Shanghai between May 10th and 15th to inspect the troops stationed in Shanghai. He is tentatively scheduled to return to the United States on the President Coolidge on May 22nd. According to reports, this is not the first time personnel have been sent for inspection. The U.S. government also took similar actions in 1925 and 1929, approximately every five years.</p>

<p>上海華商　菸廠菸葉兩公會通告</p>
<p>Shanghai Chinese Tobacco Factories and Tobacco Leaf Associations Joint Announcement</p>
<p>幸勿見利忘義</p>
<p>Hope You Will Not Be Blinded by Profit</p>
<p>維護許葉營業</p>
<p>Maintain Xuchang Tobacco Business</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Tobacco Factories Association and other organizations recently received a letter from the Xuchang Tobacco Guild, stating that a large batch of Korean tobacco leaves from Japanese merchants has recently been imported into the market, sold at discounted prices, which harms the domestic tobacco business and has a particularly large impact on tobacco farmers. The letter requested them to find ways to maintain the business. The announcement from the association is recorded below: "Recently, Japanese merchants have taken advantage of the decline of Xuchang tobacco leaves and imported a large batch of Korean tobacco leaves, selling them at discounted prices, posing a threat to replace them. The reason for the decline of Xuchang tobacco leaves stems from poor quality, which urgently needs improvement. Our association has received a letter from the Xuchang Tobacco Guild, requesting us to maintain Xuchang tobacco and to find ways to improve it in order to maintain the current business situation. Furthermore, a large batch of imported Korean tobacco leaves is white-yellow in color, more uniform in quality, and sold at a cheaper price. It is rumored that many tobacco factories in Shanghai are greedy for their cheap price and yellow color, and are buying them in large quantities, causing the Xuchang tobacco business to fall into a desperate situation. Considering the future of domestic products, we cannot help but tremble with fear. If this continues, the consequences will be dire. Our association believes that this matter concerns the people's livelihood and industry, so how can we remain silent and complacent? Therefore, we specially publish this announcement, hoping that our colleagues will uphold the purpose of saving the country through industry and the principle of considering righteousness when seeing profit. They should do their best to maintain the Xuchang tobacco business and find ways to improve it, so that the quality will improve day by day, and the price will be appropriate, ultimately benefiting the people and protecting our nation. We hope you will not be greedy for small profits and ruin domestic products. This is our sincere plea."</p>

<p>絲廠業呈蠶絲改良會　請捐助國際絲會經費</p>
<p>Silk Factories Association Submits to Silk Improvement Association, Requesting Donation for International Silk Association Expenses</p>
<p>關係整個蠶絲推銷問題</p>
<p>Relating to the Entire Silk Promotion Issue</p>
<p>希望能捐助五千元美金</p>
<p>Hoping to Donate US$5,000</p>
<p>Leaders of American silk merchants, such as Gan Li, in view of the invasion of artificial silk, in order to promote silk sales, to resist and save the fate of the silk industry, specially initiated the organization of the International Silk Association, so as to gather the strength of the group to jointly promote it. The association was established in New York last year, and Gan Li was elected as the chairman. China, Japan, Italy, etc. are all major members of the association. Miao Zhongxiu, a staff member of the Raw Silk Division of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, went to the United States last year to inspect the silk industry and participated in the preparation of the association. Recently, Miao received a letter from Gan Li, hoping that China would donate US$5,000 for the association's expenses. The Shanghai Silk Factories Association has, according to Miao's letter, submitted a request to the National Economic Committee's Silk Improvement Association for assistance. The original submission is as follows:</p>
<p>"Regarding the New York International Silk Association's letter requesting a donation, please request your association to submit it to the standing committee meeting to discuss the handling method. Your association received a letter on the 22nd of this month from Director Miao Zhongxiu of the Raw Silk Inspection Office of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, which stated that he had received a letter from Gan Li, Chairman of the New York International Silk Association, which roughly translated, said that the International Silk Association had been organized and established, (omitted, In your country, I think the silk manufacturers and exporters should meet to decide to participate and send representatives to be directors of the association. In terms of funding, I hope to donate US$5,000 as a symbol of your country's financial cooperation with the association, (omitted) This International Silk Association was initiated by American silk merchants last August. The purpose of the association is to promote real silk fabrics in order to promote silk sales. Silk producing countries are all suffering from it. The Japanese silk industry has already participated. Not only is China a silk producing country, it is also the ancestor of silk, so it seems inappropriate to ignore it. Therefore, the original letter is copied and sent to you for your consideration so that you can reply by letter, etc., and the original letter in Western language is sent to the meeting. I think this matter is the whole question of silk promotion and publicity, and the relationship is indeed very important. It is appropriate to try to participate and sponsor the funding as a symbol of cooperation. I specially attach the original letter and a transcript of the situation for submission, and I beg you to submit it to the Standing Committee for discussion and methods so that it can be handled, and it will be convenient for the public. In addition, after the repeated failures of Shanghai silk merchants in recent years, it is really impossible to collect funds. Your association is already extremely difficult to maintain at this time, and there is no way to fulfill the obligations of a member. I will merge and repeat the above. I beg you to review and give instructions to follow, and I respectfully submit to the National Economic Committee's Silk Improvement Association Chairman Zeng.</p>
<p>航政局檢查外輪日期　靜候部令遵辦</p>
<p>Date for the Navigation Administration Bureau to Inspect Foreign Vessels: Waiting for Ministerial Orders to Comply</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the inspection of foreign vessels, but no satisfactory results have been achieved. Recently, the Ministry of Communications convened a navigation promotion meeting. All shipping merchants believed that it was unfair that foreign vessels were not subject to inspection and decided to implement it uniformly. The Ministry of Communications has consulted the Ministry of Finance to instruct the customs houses to notify the foreign merchant vessels of all countries that they must be inspected and measured by the local navigation administration bureau when they enter and close the port. At the same time, the Ministry of Communications issued instructions to the various navigation administration bureaus to implement it seriously. However, according to the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau, the ministerial order did not specify a date, and it is still necessary to wait for the ministerial order to comply with whether the Ministry of Finance has instructed the customs houses and the date when the inspection will begin.</p>
<p>海員團體紛電　蔣委員長請慰留楊虎</p>
<p>Various Seamen's Groups Telegraph Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Requesting Retention of Yang Hu</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Chang Yang Hu of the Preparatory Committee of the China Seamen's Union requested to resign from the Central Government due to the heavy workload of the Security Office. All sectors and seamen's groups in Shanghai unanimously requested him to stay. Telegrams and letters arrived in droves. It is now heard that Yang is in Hangzhou. He has sent letters to Shanghai expressing his gratitude to all parties for requesting him to stay. However, it is not known whether he has changed his mind about resigning. Therefore, the seamen are increasingly fearful. Yesterday, various groups jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang, requesting him to understand the situation and persuade the Central Government to keep Yang. The original telegram is as follows: (1) Nanchang Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Junjian, Yang Hu's resignation has left the seamen without support, and they are extremely fearful. The subordinate units are pleading for the lives of more than 100,000 seamen. We beg you to convey to the Central Government that he should not be allowed to retire, and we implore you to send a telegram of comfort. The urgency is overwhelming. Thirty-odd seamen's groups, including the China Merchants New Taikoo Jardine Matheson and Nissin Stevedoring Workers' Club, respectfully kowtow. (2) Nanchang Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Junjian, Seamen's Association Member Yang Xiaotian is tired of his duties. The workers and friends are sincerely requesting him to stay. In addition to sending a telegram to the Civil Movement Association, we especially ask you to understand the situation and convey to the Central Government that he should be strongly persuaded to stay. The seamen are extremely grateful. The entire team of the Xiaochangjiang ships respectfully kowtows. The Shipping Joint Righteous Society telegraphed, "Respectfully informing you, Member Yang Xiaotian has been leading our seamen's movement for less than a year since being appointed by the Central Government. He has handled all seamen's affairs with outstanding results, and the people love and support him. Now he suddenly submits a request to resign from his position as the head of the Seamen's Preparatory Committee. Our association believes that Member Yang is an advanced member of the Party and the country, and his plans are praised by the entire country. Our seamen workers are relying on his leadership to formally establish themselves, and it is difficult to allow him to retire suddenly. Recently, we sent a telegram to the Central Executive Committee and the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee, which read, 'To the Central Executive Committee of the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee in Nanjing, We are extremely shocked to read in the newspapers these days that Member Yang Hu has requested to resign from his position as the head of the Seamen's Preparatory Committee due to the heavy workload of the Security Office. We think that Member Yang is an advanced member of the Party and the country, and he has been leading the seamen's movement for less than a year, with outstanding achievements and the unanimous support of the people. Now he suddenly wants to retire due to the heavy workload of the Security Office, causing our workers to lose their loyal leadership. We implore your committee to send a sincere telegram to retain him and not allow him to retire, so that the future of the seamen's movement will be fortunate. The Shanghai Shipping Joint Righteous Association, including the Management Department, the Restaurant Department, the Small Wheel Department, the Sanbei Hong'an Stevedores Club, the Shipping Helmsman Carpenter Mutual Aid Association, the Nanjun'an Seamen's United Charity Association, the Beijun'an Seamen's Guild, the Yan Ying General Society, the Yan Ying South Society, the Shanzheng Guild Hall, the Shipping United Benefit Association, the Shipping Nine Guilds, the Joint Office, the Shipping United Righteous Society, and the Shipping Guild respectfully kowtow and affix their seals."</p>

<p>The China Merchants Bureau, considering the poor service system of stewards on its ships, who often extort tips from passengers for alcohol, has submitted a request to the Ministry to reform the steward system, providing wages to the stewards and implementing employment procedures. Any misconduct will result in dismissal in order to benefit travelers. The Shanghai Jianghai Customs Ship Middle Cabin Guild specially sent representatives Wang Oumin and Chen Zhiqing yesterday, together with representatives of the Jingjiang ship middle cabin, to submit a document to the Central Party Headquarters Civil Movement Committee and the Ministry of Communications, requesting improvements. It is reported that the Civil Movement Committee has instructed the Seamen's Union to discuss proper measures with the China Merchants Bureau. It is heard that the China Merchants Bureau has stipulated that all ships will be reformed in phases. The Seamen's Union sent representatives to negotiate with the China Merchants Bureau yesterday, but no results were achieved.</p>
<p>吳覺農赴皖指導茶業</p>
<p>Wu Juenong Goes to Anhui to Guide the Tea Industry</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Tea Improvement Farm, recognizing that China's tea industry market is gradually declining, and that red teas from India, Ceylon, and Java are replacing the position of Anhui tea, urgently needs to seek improvement measures in order to save it. It specially hired Wu Juenong, a Shanghai expert and current director of the Agricultural Crop Inspection Group of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, to go to Qimen, the location of the Anhui Provincial Tea Improvement Farm, to guide the improvement of the tea industry. It is learned that Mr. Wu's trip is a voluntary effort, and his tasks include (1) guiding cooperation, (2) organizing a red tea manufacturing competition, (3) investigating and testing the actual situation of tea leaves, and presiding over all tea testing matters, (4) preparing for the implementation of a revitalization plan. Mr. Wu believes that this matter is of great importance to the future of China's tea industry and is a matter of duty. He has already agreed and departed for Anhui the day before yesterday to guide everything. The term is approximately one month. Once the guidance is completed, he will arrive in Nanjing before June 10 to participate in the second commodity inspection technical conference of the Ministry of Industry.</p>

<p>張素民講統制經濟</p>
<p>Zhang Sumin Lectures on Controlled Economy</p>
<p>The other day, Daxia University specially invited economic expert Dr. Zhang Sumin to lecture on "What is Controlled Economy". Hundreds of people attended the lecture. After the lecture, the whole hall applauded. It has been found out that Dr. Zhang's lecture is as follows: Controlled economy has two meanings, broad and narrow. The broad sense of controlled economy is government intervention policy. Interference policy, on the surface, is familiar to us, but in Europe and the United States, it has only been around for seven or eight years. Before the middle of the 19th century, the economy of Europe and the United States was entirely dominated by liberalism. After the middle of the 19th century, economic relations became more complicated, and the conflicts between social classes became more intense, so the governments of various countries had to adopt intervention policies. The narrow sense of controlled economy is a further step, that is, the government's planned and systematic intervention in the economic activities of the people, so that they are connected, balanced and developed. Its essential elements are planning and connection, so it is also called economic planning or planned economy. However, this kind of control is easier to carry out in countries where the means of production are publicly owned, and slightly more difficult in countries where property is privately owned. In recent years, the call for controlled economy has been high because countries are seeking a way out of economic panic. In terms of what has been done in various countries, it can be divided into three systems: (1) the British and American system or the democratic system, (2) the Italian and German system or the Fascist system, and (3) the Soviet Russian system or the socialist system. The degree of implementation in the United Kingdom is not as good as in the United States, Germany is not as good as in Italy, and Soviet Russia is a completely planned economy. The fifth five-year plan has been completed, and it is now the second year of its second five-year plan. The Economic Commission of China should pay attention to planning in the future, and control without planning is difficult to achieve results.</p>
<p>外貨傾銷中　我國電業界近况</p>
<p>Foreign Goods Dumped: Recent Situation of China's Electrical Industry</p>
<p>外國燈泡在滬製造</p>
<p>Foreign Light Bulbs Manufactured in Shanghai</p>
<p>China's electrical manufacturing industry has been progressing rapidly in recent years, which has attracted great attention from foreign merchants, who have repeatedly devised various methods to defeat Chinese factories. In order to understand the truth, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency went to the Shanghai Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association and visited Mr. Hu Xiyuan, chairman of the association. Mr. Hu was out, so Mr. Lin, the person in charge of the association, said that foreign electrical merchants have been meticulous in their various aggressions against Chinese electrical manufacturing factories. After the January 28th Incident, a foreign merchant's famous flashlight factory came to China to set up a factory to manufacture flashlights and dumped them at low prices. As a result, the foreign merchant's factory failed and closed down due to the low overhead of Chinese factories. At the same time, inferior small light bulbs were dumped in China, but the association managed to resist them, so they could not compete and stopped. Recently, foreign light bulb merchants, because of the progress of Chinese-made light bulbs, were panicked. As of the spring of last year, they organized a foreign light bulb company and tried their best to attack Chinese light bulb factories. For a year, because most Chinese people gradually became patriotic, no effect was seen. Recently, seeing that their plan failed, they released a sub-brand and sold it at a discounted price. However, most users in various places already know that the so-called foreign light bulbs are also manufactured in Shanghai, but are divided into several foreign trademarks. Therefore, they are quite indifferent to the above-mentioned foreign light bulbs.</p>

<p>雄鷄牌毛巾商標勝利　行政院認局部核駁均爲不合</p>
<p>Xiongji Brand Towel Trademark Victory: The Executive Yuan Believes That Partial Rejection is Inappropriate</p>
<p>雄雞牌成立雞球牌不准註册</p>
<p>Xiongji Brand Established, Jiqiu Brand Not Allowed to Register</p>
<p>Mr. Ling Pengfei, manager of Jinglun Cotton Weaving Factory, for the Jiqu Brand trademark of Huaxing Towel Factory, after re-appealing to the Executive Yuan, the Executive Yuan decided that Jinglun had the final victory. The decision of the Executive Yuan is recorded below: (Twenty-third Year Litigation No. 9) Re-Appellant, Ling Pengfei, manager of Jinglun Cotton Weaving Factory, male, 56 years old, from Nanhui, residing at Yuchangxiang Towel Shop, No. 8 Dongjiadu, Shanghai. The right re-appellant filed a re-appeal to this court due to disagreement with the decision of the Ministry of Industry in a trademark dispute case with Huaxing Towel Factory. The decision of this court is as follows: (Main text) The original disposition and decision are both revoked. The Jiqu Brand trademark of Huaxing Towel Factory in this case should not be allowed to register. (Facts) The re-appellant submitted to the Trademark Bureau the Jiqu Brand trademark No. 13939 of Huaxing Towel Factory for use on towel products, believing that it was similar to the Xiongji Brand trademark No. 42 and the Diqiu Brand trademark No. 12916 that the re-appellant used on the same product and were already registered, and had a suspicion of imitation. He repeatedly raised objections to the Trademark Bureau, but they were all rejected. The re-appellant did not agree with this disposition and appealed to the Ministry of Industry, but was rejected again. Still not satisfied, he filed a re-appeal to the court. (Reasons) If the text and graphics of two or more trademarks objectively have the risk of causing confusion among buyers, they are similar. In this case, the Jiqu Brand trademark of Huaxing Towel Factory approved by the Trademark Bureau uses the chicken and the ball as the graphic pattern of the trademark. Comparing it with the Xiongji Brand trademark and the Diqiu Brand trademark registered by the re-appellant, the words "chicken" and "ball" are the same in the text, and the graphics all use the chicken or the ball as the main part of the trademark. Although the colors used by the two parties are different, the chickens have differences in whether their beaks are open or their tails are raised, and the patterns of the balls are also different, it is inevitable that there will be confusion among buyers at different times and places. The Trademark Bureau and the Ministry of Industry's request for the re-appellant regarding the Jiqu Brand trademark of Huaxing Towel Factory not to be allowed to register is unavoidable and inappropriate. Based on the above conclusions, this re-appeal is justified. Therefore, in accordance with the previous paragraph of Article 9 of the litigation law, the main text is decided, March 24th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, President Wang Zhaoming.</p>

Fortunately, the firefighters bravely extinguished the fire after half an hour. Three houses were destroyed, and it was learned that two female workers had not escaped. They were rescued urgently, but they were all burned. They were sent to the hospital, but died on the way due to their injuries. They were sent to the coroner's office for autopsy.</p>

<p>Pederi on Xinzha Road has been without water for five days because the Catholic Church, the landlord, demanded an increase in water fees, and ordered the water company to install meters for each household, which was rejected by the tenants. The landlord cut off the water supply on the 24th. The landlord has shown no remorse, although a public tap has been opened on Xinzha Road, thousands of tenants are scrambling for water, which is not enough, and it is extremely crowded.</p>

<p>Sports News: Guanghua and Central Divide the Spoils; Jiangnan University Athletics Championship: Guanghua Retains Track Title, Central Wins Field Title Again; Central Sweeps Women's Titles; Twelve New Jiangnan University Records Set by Men and Women</p>
<p>The Jiangnan University 7th Annual Athletics Meet, held at Zhenru and Jinan University over the past two days, concluded yesterday. Guanghua University retained the track championship, while Central University secured the field championship. The women's championship was again swept by Central. The weather was uncooperative, greatly diminishing the enjoyment, and thus the results were mediocre. However, while far from our ideal expectations, progress was indeed made. Men broke seven Jiangnan University records, women broke four, and one new event record was set, totaling five. This is also somewhat satisfactory. Score table for each school: Guanghua and Central Universities continue to dominate the "track" and "field" respectively, each retaining their championship for another year. Guanghua's track success was due to the Dong brothers and Tao Yingjie, who secured six first-place finishes. Only the 10,000 meters and high hurdles fell into other hands. Central also captured five first-place finishes in field events, only missing out on high jump and long jump. Women's athletics was entirely Central's domain. The scores are listed below:</p>
<p>Men's Track:</p>
<p>(1) Guanghua...32 points (5) Fudan...8 points</p>
<p>(2) Central...16 points (6) Chizhi...6 points</p>

<p>Today's Athletics Match: Far East Games Athletes vs. Shanghai Westerners at 2 PM at the China Athletics Field: A Gathering of Talents, a Spectacle to Behold</p>
<p>To prepare our country's athletics team for the Far East Games, a friendly match has been arranged against a Shanghai Westerners team at 2 PM today at the China Athletics Field on Father Laoshen Road. This gathering of national elites against outstanding athletes from various countries in Shanghai provides an opportunity to hone skills, and exceptional results are expected. The participating teams include 27 athletes from our side (the Western team list is not yet finalized). Number bibs for all athletes can be collected from the Association for the Advancement of Physical Culture at 10 AM today. Order at the venue will be maintained by the East Asia Physical Education College Boy Scouts. Admission tickets are uniformly priced at six dimes, and entry will be through the Sapor Road entrance. This competition is purely for practice and will not be scored. Participating athletes' events will be decided on the spot, so pre-grouping is not possible. The venue staff and competition schedule are listed below:</p>

<p>High Hurdles Record Broken: Liu Yingjun's time of 16.8 seconds in the high hurdles was somewhat satisfactory. Tao Yingjie finished third but was disqualified for knocking over three hurdles. Tian Wushunwen was promoted as a result. Tao Yingjie's time of 61.4 seconds in the low hurdles broke the Jiangnan University record, but it was much slower than the national record. There was no competition.</p>
<p>Javelin Performance Most Disappointing: Among the field events, the javelin throw of 39.35 meters was the most disappointing, due to the use of domestically made equipment. The javelins were soft and unstable, preventing anyone from performing satisfactorily. However, the meet regulations stipulated the use of domestic products, so there was nothing to be done. The field event results are listed below:</p>
<p>Pole Vault:</p>
<p>(1) Lei Ruilin (Central) 3.27 meters</p>

<p>Report on Women's Finals: Hu Ruisheng Scores a Hat Trick</p>

<p>Far East Games: Japanese Athletes Departed Yesterday; A Delegation of 163 Members</p>
<p>(United Japanese News Agency, Kobe, 28th) Regardless of whether it's for or against participation in the Far East Games, public opinion is divided. However, the delegation of athletes has decided to embark on their expedition amidst this swirl of opinion. At 10 AM on the 28th, amidst a heavy police presence and strict security measures, the delegation of 166 members boarded six buses. They boarded the special ship "Taihe Maru" at noon, and it is scheduled to set sail at 3 PM on the 29th. It is reported that the athletes are waiting quietly in their cabins before departure.</p>
<p>Breakdown of Athletes and Staff (United Japanese News Agency, Kobe, 28th): The breakdown of the athlete delegation on the "Taihe Maru" is as follows:</p>

<p>More than 20 Staff: Total: 143</p>
<p>Nambu Unable to Attend Due to Foot Injury (United Japanese News Agency, Osaka, 28th): Chūhei Nambu, considered a world-class athlete in jumping, suddenly announced before departure that his foot pain had not fully recovered and requested to withdraw from the Far East Games. It is said that his inability to attend is entirely due to his foot injury and has nothing to do with the issue of non-participation.</p>
<p>(Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 28th): At 11:30 PM last night, five thugs, each armed with a five-foot-long bamboo spear, attempted to break into the Athlete's Hotel, the lodging for the athletes from the Asia Rink Club sent to the Far East Games in Koshien. Members of the Nishinomiya Police Station, who were on guard, prevented them. In the ensuing struggle, the face and shoulder of Chief Investigator Kinoshita were lacerated. Swimmer Tetsuo Iyeshiro (Nihon University) suffered a right arm injury, and Toshihei Kaida of Tokyo Higher Normal School was injured in the face. Swimmers Tokushi Ishiharada (Meiji University) and Masanori Yusa (Nihon University), who rushed down from upstairs upon hearing the commotion, were injured in their arms. Yoshiyuki Kauchii (Waseda University) was also injured. Fortunately, the injuries to the athletes were not so severe as to prevent them from competing. The thugs were members of the Meisō Club Boxing Club in Iwabuchi, Tokyo.</p>
<p>(Electric News Agency, Koshien, 28th): The athletes sent to the Far East Games who were lodging in this Athlete's Hotel were demoralized by various acts of violence and agitation by a faction opposing participation. Despite concerns about their departure, they resolved to participate. At 9 AM this morning, they left the lodging and headed to Kobe to board the "Taihe Maru," which was waiting for them. They were escorted to Kobe by Hyogo Prefecture police in buses along the Hanshin National Highway. They boarded the "Taihe Maru" at noon.</p>
<p>Poor Track and Field Records (Electric News Agency, Osaka, 28th): The final record-keeping session for the track and field representatives to the Far East Games was held yesterday afternoon at the Koshien South Athletic Field under strict police guard. Except for the javelin throw of 65.50 meters by Saburo Nagao, there were no good records. This was partly due to the disputes surrounding participation, which affected the athletes' morale. Director Okita told reporters that the poor records were due to the athletes' mental state and that he believed they would recover before departure.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Sends Staff to the Philippines to Report on Far East Games; Feng Youzhen Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday and Set Sail in Two Days (Nanjing, 28th): The Far East Games are scheduled to be held in the Philippines on May 12th.

With ten minutes left in the game, it started to rain, and Huadian scored an own goal. As a result, Huadian won 5-1.

<p>Education News: Outlying Shaanxi Education Key Areas for Improvement Ministry of Education Supervisor's Report (Continued from Yesterday) As for "bad habits," in the past century, China has suffered from the invasion of foreign cultures, leading to the shaking and destruction of inherent Chinese etiquette. Meanwhile, the advantages of Western culture have not been successfully established. In this period of transition between the old and the new, a lawless society has formed, creating bad habits. All aspects of life, including clothing, food, housing, and transportation, lack proper restraint and have become a very loose way of life for the people. Due to bad habits, the spirit of the nation has declined daily. Especially since the "September 18th Incident" and the "January 28th Incident," people generally feel the invasion of imperialists, the danger to the country's status, and the lack of progress in Chinese politics. They believe that China is beyond saving and that it is best to live recklessly. With the loss of self-defense, general life has tended toward pessimism, negativity, romanticism, decadence, world-weariness, and hedonism. Society lacks discipline and order, so how can national spirit and national strength arise? "There is no greater sorrow than a dead heart." If the national psychology is so decadent, it will not be able to avoid destruction even without external troubles and internal worries, especially in these times of the strong preying on the weak. The influence of bad habits on society and the country is so great. There are many who talk about saving the country today, some say aviation will save the country, some say industry will save the country, some say domestic goods will save the country, etc. Although there are many methods, they are all biased towards one aspect and are not fundamental solutions. If the spirit of the nation is inclined towards negativity and decadence, how can any undertaking proceed? Therefore, the fundamental solution is to first invigorate the national spirit, and then all undertakings to save the country can be carried out. To restore the national spirit, we must first eliminate "bad habits," transform "old habits," and promote "new habits." Only then can we express a positive and upward spirit and promote all undertakings to save the country. Therefore, we see the order and restraint of the ancients and the lack of order and restraint of the moderns, and we see that the national crisis is worsening day by day. In order to think fundamentally, we have this New Life Movement.</p>
<p>10. The number of junior high school classes run by provincial normal schools is greater than the number of normal school classes, which goes against the original intention. From next year onwards, only normal school classes should be enrolled. If enrollment is difficult at present, a simplified normal course can be offered first. If there are junior high school classes, they can also be appropriately changed to simplified normal school classes.</p>
<p>11. The county normal schools in each county are all training courses for teachers, and the equipment, curriculum, and graduation period are not in line with regulations in many ways. Funding should be increased immediately, and they should be reorganized into simplified normal schools according to Article 6 of the Normal School Regulations.</p>
<p>12. The provincial vocational schools are few in number, and the results are not very impressive. In the future, in addition to thoroughly reorganizing the three existing schools, appropriate locations should be selected in the north and south, and junior and senior vocational schools should be added separately to meet local needs.</p>
<p>13. The workshops in each vocational school are not adequate. The internship time, except for the sewing, knitting, and dyeing departments of the Xi'an First Women's Public Vocational School, which already account for half of the teaching time, is far from the prescribed standards. They should be improved separately.</p>
<p>14. Women's secondary education in the province is quite backward. The number of schools should be increased according to plan, and the content should be enriched. In places where provincial women's secondary schools have not been established or cannot be added for a while, women's normal classes or women's middle school classes can be temporarily set up in provincial secondary schools to provide more opportunities for female primary school graduates to study.</p>
<p>15. The salaries of principals and directors of secondary schools should be divided into grades according to the number of classes and qualifications and experience. The teaching salaries of normal and vocational schools equivalent to senior high schools should also be paid according to senior high school standards to be fair. In addition, there are too many part-time teachers in each school, and the hours are fragmented. The full-time teacher system should be strictly implemented, and the number of part-time teachers should not exceed one-fourth of the total number of teachers.</p>
<p>16. The regulations for teacher training, salary scales, and annual salary increase regulations for secondary schools should be formulated as soon as possible and submitted to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>17. There are too many out-of-school children in the province. In addition to increasing the number of primary schools as much as possible, counties should be ordered to add simplified primary schools and short-term primary schools in accordance with Article 5 of the Primary School Regulations to promote free education.</p>
<p>18. The Department previously stipulated that all primary schools should start in the fall, which is not suitable for rural social life. Each school should be ordered to run spring classes to give more children the opportunity to attend school.</p>
<p>19. Many senior primary schools are still established independently in various counties. They should be ordered to add junior primary schools immediately or merge with other local junior primary schools to comply with the law.</p>
<p>20. The names of provincial and county primary schools should be corrected in accordance with Article 11 of the Primary School Regulations. Many primary schools in various counties still use the old model names. Their content is no different from ordinary primary schools. They should be ordered to abolish the word "model." It is also inappropriate for private groups to use public names for primary schools. In addition, the provincial experimental primary school lacks experimental plans and results and should be strictly reorganized to live up to its name.</p>
<p>21. The scores listed in the weekly teaching schedule for each subject in primary schools can be divided by three. The original intention was to facilitate the distribution of 30, 45, or 60 minutes into one class. Regardless of the subject, if 30 minutes are set as one class, it is too restrictive and loses the original meaning.</p>
<p>22. Primary school classes with fewer students should use a compound system in accordance with the Primary School Law to save expenses. The number of students in the lower grades is often excessive and the two-part system can be implemented to accommodate them.</p>
<p>23. The province is the source of Chinese culture, and the local teaching materials in various places are unusually rich. The education administrative agencies in each county should be ordered to be responsible for editing in accordance with Article 31 of the Primary School Regulations.</p>
<p>24. The teaching equipment of schools at all levels is extremely simple, except for a very small number. In the future, (1) public funds should be saved to support them, (2) equipment fees should be saved and used as a whole, (3) public science museums should be established in places with more schools, and (4) specimens, models, wall charts, and simple instruments should be made jointly by staff and students as much as possible.</p>
<p>25. Labor teaching should be thoroughly improved, and the religious curriculum of church schools should be completely abolished.</p>
<p>26. Many primary and secondary school teachers' teaching methods are inappropriate and urgently need to be studied and improved. The Primary School Education Research Association should also be organized in accordance with the Primary School Regulations.</p>
<p>27. After a strict reorganization, the order of general students is still good. However, in addition to negative sanctions and interference, more positive guidance and enlightenment should be added to achieve a more permanent effect of imperceptible influence.</p>
<p>28. The province's social education, in addition to the establishment of provincial institutions, is mostly poor in content and should be implemented in accordance with the proposed three-year social education plan to achieve results.</p>
<p>29. The province lacks social education talents and should attach a social education personnel training class to the provincial senior high school or the provincial first normal school. Each county should send personnel to receive training in stages. When the training is completed, they should be ordered to return to their place of origin to handle social education.</p>
<p>30. The province is the site of the capitals of the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties, and various antiquities, monuments, and documents are available everywhere. Destruction and dispersal are a pity. They should be transported in accordance with the implementation rules of the Law on the Preservation of Antiquities promulgated by the Executive Yuan and the revised organization outline of the Municipal and County Literature Committee, and the Antiquities Preservation Committee and the Literature Committee should be organized separately to be responsible for the collection and maintenance to respect antiquities.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Orders Zhejiang, Shandong, and Jiangsu Education Departments to Implement Regional Guidance System and Distribute Guidance Outlines (Nanjing, 28th): The Ministry of Education ordered the Education Departments of Zhejiang, Shandong, and Jiangsu to investigate the general outline of the methods of regional guidance of county and municipal public education in each province, which had been resolved by the Ministry's Committee on Public Education and recorded and sent. The public education of counties and cities has always been promoted by the education departments of each province, but it is not easy to guide Zhou Min in each province, and progress is often slow. This regional guidance system can still remedy the above-mentioned malpractices and should be tried out first. It is found that the province can try out this system, and it is appropriate to copy and send the original resolution outline and order to follow it, formulate methods and submit them for approval. (1) The Provincial Education Department may divide the whole province into several public education guidance areas. (2) Each guidance area must set up a central guidance agency, which shall be designated by the Provincial Education Department from the provincial public education hall, experimental public school, or other equivalent provincial education agency in the province. (3) The powers of the district central guidance agency are as follows: 1. Supervise the promotion of public education in the whole area, 2. Guide the improvement of public education in the whole area, 3. Train public education service personnel in the area, 4. Organize experiments and demonstrations of public education. All public education institutions in the area shall accept the supervision and guidance of the district central guidance agency. The results of the supervision and guidance shall be assessed by the Education Department. The supervision and guidance plan of the District Central Guidance Agency shall be submitted to the Education Department for approval, and the progress of supervision and guidance shall be reported to the Education Department for record. (4) The district central guidance agency shall cooperate with the district party and government agencies, education agencies, autonomous agencies, education departments, and other relevant organizations and enthusiastic people. (5) The central guidance agency may organize a district public education research association. (6) All regulations on guidance shall be formulated by the education departments of each province and reported to the Ministry of Education for approval.</p>
<p>University Presidents Must Not Hold Concurrent Positions (Nanjing, 28th): The National Government issued an order on the 28th to amend and promulgate Article 9 of the University Organization Law. The article is as follows: A university shall have a president who shall be responsible for all university affairs. The presidents of national, provincial, and municipal universities shall be appointed to a simple position and shall not hold other positions except for teaching courses at the university.</p>
<p>Education Bureau Orders Colleges and Universities to Postpone Enrollment to August</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau instructed the private colleges and universities in the city yesterday: It is hereby ordered that the new students enrolled by colleges and universities should be held in late July at the earliest, which has been communicated to the Ministry for compliance. Now, due to the complex procedures of the education departments of provinces and cities for handling the unified examination and issuing certificates, the date of enrollment is still not conducive to students' further education. Therefore, it is specially re-ordered that the new students enrolled by colleges and universities should be postponed to August. In addition to separate lines, it is appropriate to order the Bureau to instruct compliance.</p>
<p>Student Unrest in the Third Grade of Songjiang Provincial High School (Songjiang News): Students in the third grade of Songjiang Provincial High School have been brewing student unrest recently, and it broke out yesterday. Three probation students, Tang Zeyi, Shen Runmin, and Huang Zhaoguang, have been expelled by the principal for destroying the school badge, a serious offense, in accordance with the Jiangsu Education Department's Order No. 252 on rectifying the school spirit. The families of the other students in the class have been sent letters to persuade their children to come to school, stating that the students have been studying for nearly three years, and that when the summer vacation comes, they should work hard to complete their studies to live up to the expectations of their parents. Now, they still do not ask whether it is right or wrong, do not consider the pros and cons, and do not talk about reason. It is clear that they are motivated by temporary emotions and are actually obstructing the holding of the mid-term examination. Therefore, there are requests to withdraw from school and arbitrary strikes. Persuasion is ineffective, and the school authorities are heartbroken. They hope that the students will achieve success and are willing to compromise. They are hereby requested to persuade their children to come to school. It is reported that the reason for this student unrest is that the graduation examination will be held in Zhenjiang in accordance with the regulations. The school authorities plan to hold a mid-term examination before going to the provincial capital for the examination to select students who have completed their studies and whose examination results are acceptable to participate in the provincial examination. The students believe that the mid-term examination is redundant and are unwilling to comply with it. This is one reason. One night, some students went out of the school privately, and a director saw it. He did not stop them at the time and told the principal afterwards, who expelled and recorded the students. The students are dissatisfied. Recently, an mimeographed publication of Lao Yingji was found, with satirical articles. It was bound at Dashengchang yesterday and was found by the school. The Public Security Bureau was asked to send someone to Dashengchang to search for it and summon student Dai Kunpei for questioning. This is another reason. The school has scheduled to hold a spring sports meet, and the third grade students have agreed not to participate. It is said that Principal Peng Weiji is determined to rectify the school spirit. The two sides have different opinions. I wonder how the final result will be resolved.</p>

<p>The Eleventh Issue of Women's Garden: The End of Eugenics by Xu Xizhen</p>
<p>On the road of modern cultural development, World War I clearly became an indelible milestone. Besides exposing the faces of the rulers, the lesson it taught people was the awakening of scholars in general to the conflict between theory and fact. After the World War, the development of capitalism proceeded at a high speed, and its end - the coming of economic collapse - also took on a rapidly declining trend. The general theoretical doctrines before the war also got an opportunity to be practically tested, and eugenics was one of them.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of eugenics is to attempt to improve the race based on biological principles. They treat the race with Darwin's law of elimination and selection, and believe that the family is the social organization that has a direct relationship with the race. Therefore, eugenicists have put as much effort into family issues as sociologists: they believe that the family is the unit of society, mainly because it has the function of reproduction. They believe that the disintegration of modern family organization is a terrible morbidity. They oppose the combination of men and women who do not engage in reproductive function. They oppose women engaging in social movements (they say that even if women's movements are necessary, they should only be done by a few women who lack "motherhood"; but this is actually equivalent to opposition, because is the so-called "women's movement" not the business of a "small number of women"?). They believe that a woman's natural duty is to be a virtuous child-rearing woman, or the generally so-called "virtuous wife and good mother," to make a contribution to the cause of improving the race. On the one hand, they oppose the romantic spirit of individualism, and on the other hand, they criticize the socialist public child-rearing. Starting from eugenics, these conclusions are naturally not surprising. From the perspective of improving the race, what else can women do besides being virtuous mothers? It is simply a tedious task to explain or deny the above proposition; for example, to try to explain the pros and cons of public child-rearing, the necessity for women to engage in the acquisition of a reasonable social system, etc., are the work of experts. At the same time, we don't want to use some socialist jargons or even maliciously criticize the fallacies of eugenicists. We only want to use the facts of the current society to illustrate whether the natural duty of women is limited to "raising good babies" and whether such designs can exist at all.</p>
<p>First, let's take a look at countries where capitalism is more developed; before and after the war, under the tense situation, everyone wanted to find a new stimulus, and individualistic conscious elements sneaked into literature and sociology. The pursuit of pleasure, accompanied by the special national character of loving freedom, made the family organization in the society increasingly unstable. The interest in this phenomenon is of course not sudden. When the method of production reached the stage of the industrial revolution, the organization of the family also began to gradually disintegrate. This is a phenomenon that eugenicists are very worried about. Women of the laboring class threw away the "natural duty" of child-rearing or household chores and ran into factories, working with gears and motors. Intellectual women of the propertied class are no longer happy to be bothered by children. People regard children as a hateful burden for the sake of life and enjoyment, but at that time it was only "hateful." What about now when capitalism is collapsing? Children are wanted, but the lack of the ability to raise them is a fact. We run into the magnificent cities of the gold standard countries. You can go and see how many men's hearts are beating in the reception room of the obstetrics hospital every day, "Damn, what terrible children."</p>
<p>In China, the concept of family is more intense than in any other country. According to the usual practice, it seems that there is no need for eugenicists to worry and teach the inherent duty of child-rearing. But what is the current situation? A small part (a very small part) of educated people are infected with the atmosphere of individualism and are unwilling to have children. Most of the petty citizens who have been formally brainwashed by the ancient訓of "There are three unfilial acts" are mostly willing to have children, but "giving birth" is done, but "raising" becomes a big problem. The result is that the society adds a group of "half-baked" people. As for the working class and peasants? In a straightforward sentence: "We can't afford to raise sons!" After a woman gives birth to a child, she thinks it is an excellent opportunity and throws her son to a mansion to be a nanny. For this, they are not completely unaware of any shortcomings. They also resent their own lack of ability. The harsh treatment of pregnant women in factories makes them feel at all times: "This world is a bit wrong."</p>
<p>It's not that they don't want a family; it's that they can't maintain it. What should they do? The profound theories and worries of eugenics are of no use to them. Even if they are willing to be "virtuous wives and good mothers," reality makes them doubt. Under such circumstances, the more prosperous the population productivity, the more anemic, weak, and ignorant people there will be in the society, and the consequences will of course be unimaginable.</p>
<p>New women under a reasonable social system will certainly not be the "good child-rearing women" ideal of eugenicists, and their labor will not only be spent on lullabies and breastfeeding. If the social system is as chaotic as it is now, how can "eugenics" be "good"?</p>
<p>For this, eugenicists will definitely say, "That's not our business," but because those scholars have neglected the economic organization as the foundation of society, the "peaceful world" in the imagination of eugenicists has always become the ideal country of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>The fact is that women in the new era will not (or can be said to be unable to) stay at home to do child-rearing work. We believe that only in this way can we approach a reasonable social system.</p>
<p>World Great Thinkers' Opinions on Women's Issues (4) by Hua</p>
<p>John Stuart Mill John Stuart Mill (John Stuart Mill) was born in 1806 and died in 1873. He was a great British philosopher, political activist, and economist of the time. His father, James Mill, was an authority on classical economics - one of the famous students of Ricardo. Therefore, the young Mill, inheriting the legacy of his ancestors, was also one of the representatives of the era when classical economics was declining. He wrote a book "Principles of Political Economy," which summarized and systematized the economic thoughts popular in Britain in the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>John Stuart Mill was also one of the first to advocate women's equality. In 1870, he published his famous book "The Subjection of Women," which was widely popular. In this book, he first reasoned from the perspective of social development that women must be in a position of equality with men. He said: "If people think that the theory of equality between the sexes is only based on theory; then it should be remembered that the theory of inequality between the sexes, in addition to theory, has no other reason. All practical experience proves that the theory of equality between the sexes is beneficial, which is nothing more than saying that mankind can only survive under this system (equality between men and women), to this day we have seen this stage of progress and happiness. ······Experience certainly proves that with each month of improvement, the social status of women will be raised one step. Historians and philosophers must use the increase or decrease of the social status of women as the most accurate and appropriate measure of the civilization of a nation or a century. If we try to review all eras of human history, we can see that the status of women is constantly approaching equality with men. This alone, although not sufficient to prove that this movement must reach full equality, is undoubtedly some inferential data: the fact is indeed so." To this day, some people who oppose women's liberation, their main argument is that women's innate qualities are fundamentally inferior to men's, meaning that women are born as "inferior races" and should not be equal to men. In fact, this view is still a traditional fallacy. John Stuart Mill said long ago: "The most stubborn and persistent people who scold women dare not deny that women - if we add together the modern experience and the experience of the past centuries, it can be said that not a few women, but most women - can do everything that men can do, and they do it very smoothly and sincerely. The most important thing is that there are many events that no woman has successfully done as well as some - very few - men, and there are some things that they have not yet reached the highest stage of perfection. Is it not obvious that prohibiting women from competing with men in some similar occupations is a great infringement on women's rights and a great loss to society?······Oral Hygiene for Children by You Bai</p>
<p>The mouth is the gateway for food to enter the body. If the mouth is not washed and the teeth are not brushed, various germs can be swallowed into the stomach and intestines with food and drink without intention, causing infection and illness. Moreover, the residue of food and dirt adheres to the inside and outside of the teeth, slowly causing inflammation of the gums, or viruses invading the dental pulp, causing pulpitis. Good teeth become bad teeth. Initially, chewing is inconvenient, and toothache often occurs, causing nervousness. Then, various gastrointestinal diseases occur, and as a result, the development of the whole body is hindered. Especially in childhood, the stomach and intestines are weak and development is incomplete, so the harm is even easier to occur.</p>
<p>From the above, oral hygiene is so closely related to children's health. Then all parents and teachers who are responsible for raising and educating children must cultivate children's oral hygiene habits. The simplest and easiest methods are as follows: (1) Brush your teeth twice every morning and evening, and wash and dry the toothbrush. (2) Rinse your mouth after meals. (3) Eat less candy, especially dates. (Eating too much can easily damage the enamel.) (4) Do not chew hard objects. (5) Do not eat things that are too cold or too hot. (6) Do not put your fingers or sharp penholders into your mouth. (7) Do not pick your teeth with fingernails or other unclean things.</p>
<p>When parents and teachers find that children's teeth are deformed, overlap, or have decayed teeth, they should go to a dentist for correction and treatment, so that their teeth can develop normally, maintain the proper development of the whole body, and cultivate a healthy and happy little citizen - the future master of China.</p>
<p>Overseas Women's News by Biwu</p>
<p>(1) International Open Door Federation (Open Door International) The International Open Door Federation is composed of women representatives from eighteen countries. The third conference will be held in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, on January 5th of this year. More than 80 representatives will attend to discuss issues such as women's employment, labor of married women, women's physical labor, etc., and unanimously resolved to oppose all restrictions imposed on these issues.</p>
<p>(2) International Equal Rights Alliance (Equal Rights International) The fifth conference of the International Equal Rights Alliance was held in Geneva last December, with participants from 22 countries. The International Open Door Federation and the American Women's Federation have joined. The purpose of the association was to obtain equal rights for men and women. Now it has slightly changed, and it will devote all its efforts to concluding international treaties on equality between men and women. Its thoughts and actions are roughly the same as those of the American Women's Federation.</p>
<p>(3) Pacific Women's Conference The Pacific Women's Conference is composed of women representatives from countries along the Pacific coast and the United Kingdom and India related to it, totaling thirteen countries. It is scheduled to hold a conference in Honolulu in August of this year, with a session of about one month. Its main topics are: labor women and family issues, women and international peace, women's trafficking, children and mothers' health issues, women's political participation issues, vocational education issues, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Victory of Women at the Pan-American Conference From December 3rd to 26th last year, the Seventh Pan-American Conference was held in Montevideo, Uruguay. At that time, two major proposals were put forward regarding women, one: "Equality between men and women in nationality law," and the other: "Equality between men and women in politics and law in all countries participating in this conference." The two proposals were rejected by a small margin: the first proposal has been passed. Previously, a similar proposal to the first proposal was submitted at the Hague International Law Codification Conference hosted by the League of Nations. Although women tried their best at that time, it ended in failure. Therefore, the success of the Pan-American Conference can be said to be the honor of women in the New World.</p>
<p>(5) Peruvian Women's Election Movement Begins South American countries are extremely depressed in the women's movement due to the influence of their mother country. Recently, due to the Spanish Revolution, the autocratic monarchs were driven away, and the people's spirit gradually expanded. Therefore, women in South American countries have gradually shown vitality. Many well-known women in Lima, the capital of Peru, saw the victory of women at the Montevideo Pan-American Conference. Therefore, a meeting was held to decide to carry out a women's election movement.</p>
<p>(6) Portugal stipulates the qualifications for women's suffrage Since the revolution, Portugal has given women the right to participate in politics, but there are some restrictions on the qualifications, namely: (1) Those who have the right to vote in district councils - widows, divorced women, separated women, and single women who have the responsibility of supporting the elderly and young. (2) Those who have the right to vote in local councils - men must be able to read and write and pay taxes. Women must have received secondary and higher education or hold public office. (3) Those who have the right to vote in the Central Council and the President - those who have the right to vote in local councils.</p>
<p>(7) The misfortunes of German women under Hitler's rule It is well known that German women have suffered great misfortunes since Hitler's dictatorship came to power. It began with a strange cry that "women should belong to the family!" and exempted many women officials or teachers from their positions. Then, the right of married women to be employed was restricted. In December last year, there was also an agreement to exclude female doctors at the meeting of the government and medical groups. This year, the government stipulates that the national university enrollment quota is 15,000, and only 1,500 women are allowed, accounting for one-tenth of the total. Moreover, the entrance examinations for women are made difficult in many ways. In addition to academic ability, there must also be a physical and personal examination.</p>
<p>Mother's Heart by Liang - A Page of Diary -</p>
<p>The rumbling of cars on the street shattered my good dream. In a daze, I saw the sunlight sneaking in through the cracks in the window, telling me the time, telling me that it was not early. Still, I was attacked by fatigue, and for the sake of work and life, I had to support myself to get up. Looking at Man'er, who was sleeping soundly in the bed, her cheeks were as red as ripe apples, her dry lips had several cracks, and her eyelids were swollen. This was the result of last night's crying. The child who always smiles, everyone says is cute, cried and fussed like this last night. Needless to say, the burning heat was enough to make her suffer. But I was tired and eager to rest, how impatiently I scolded her, how cruel I am, "Mom" I am ashamed. After dressing Hui'er, washing her face, and preparing breakfast, I also tidied up hastily, filled my stomach, and it was already half past eight. I told Wang Ma (she is the only person I entrust when I go out to work) how to take care of Man'er as usual, and asked her to pay special attention to her cold and warmth, and diet, because her fever had not completely subsided. In this way, I took Hui'er and hurried out the door. Six-year-old Hui'er has a curious and active nature, and there is simply no moment of stillness. She doesn't understand danger, doesn't know the harm, tries this, takes that, it is indeed the most difficult to manage and most needs to be educated period for children. Fortunately, he and I are in the same school, and I can take care of his actions from time to time, otherwise, I don't know how I will worry about him? There are four lessons today, which is really not too busy. Because I am afraid that I will not have time after returning home, the distribution of teaching materials, the collection of references, and the correction of test papers completely filled the empty time. But because of the sleeplessness at night and Man'er's illness, I was absent-minded and could not concentrate on my work. The day before yesterday, Director Chen told me that the cleanliness and order of my class have greatly deteriorated recently, and this time the arithmetic competition was at the bottom again. His words contained a warning meaning, which I felt. I was also a competitive person, and it was not that I didn't want to be outstanding in everything, but the environment was always so difficult. My body, since giving birth to two children, has neither been properly recuperated nor had adequate rest, and it is very different from the past. Recently, because of the busy work, I feel even more exhausted. If this continues, not to mention that the school will be dissatisfied with me, I myself feel that it is difficult to cope with. But when I think about it, will the panic of unemployment not aggravate the mental pain? I can only do it, and work hard!</p>
<p>The last bell rang, and I was as if I had been pardoned - this is not because I am not loyal to my work, Man'er's illness really occupies my whole heart - I took Hui'er home. Entering the door, after receiving her from Wang Ma's hand, half of the heavy burden on my heart has been lifted, because from her face and forehead, I know that the situation is not as bad as I expected in the school. In my series of questions: "Did she cry?" "Did she eat porridge?" "How many times?" "How much?" "How long did she sleep?" "How are the bowel movements?" "When did the fever completely subside?" Wang Ma's answers made me feel satisfied. The worries disappeared temporarily like smoke. Jian came back and saw a smile on the corner of Man'er's mouth. She unfolded the clouds of sorrow on her face and forced a smile to say to me: "With a mother like you, the children will not suffer too much." Is this comforting me? On the contrary, it made me uneasy. A mother with weak ability has tried her best to fight for life. Although the happiness of the children is the only wish that surrounds her heart, she still cannot help but neglect it due to the limitations of time and energy. The reason is not that she doesn't love her children, but that she loves them too much. Dinner was earlier than usual. As usual, I warmed up Hui'er's homework and took care of some chores. After settling the two children to sleep, I also wanted to rest. After getting into bed, the fatigue of the body had reached its peak, but the brain still did not listen to commands and kept turning, from the health of the children to the education of the children, the future, the responsibilities and burdens of the parents, the occupation and life!! Gradually, in many blurry images, I lost consciousness.</p>
<p>After Marriage (Continued) by Lian Sheng</p>
<p>Although we are poor, we can live comfortably every month by selling articles to maintain our lives. We live in the pavilion room - bedroom, kitchen, reception room, dining room. Although I grew up in the life of the aristocracy, everything I used to disdain to do, I am now doing happily one by one, without complaining or worrying. This surprised his friends. Before, they only thought that I was just a beautiful and modern college student. Naturally, household chores were something I disdained to do. But the fact is the opposite. Every day, I go to the vegetable market to buy vegetables, cook side dishes, cook rice, wash dishes, wash clothes, sweep the floor, mop the floor····Who says it doesn't make them sigh, even their wives from the countryside are unwilling to buy side dishes! I wanted to find a job, but he wouldn't allow it. He said: What do women do, they are just vases for the institution! Taking a step back, I said to seek a teacher's position, but he also disagreed, because this would give other men a chance to please me. What can I do? I have to listen to him, otherwise, our feelings will break down because of this. I can only bury myself in writing articles, and he approves of this. I have a child in my stomach, and I am already seven months pregnant. Sometimes when we argue over a small matter, he will say that the child is not his. "Let's see when it is born. If it doesn't look like me, it is not my child!" What arbitrary words. I don't know how many tears I have shed in secret for these words. Really, what method can I use to explain? And who can guarantee that the child born in the future will really look like him? This injustice will always be buried in my heart.</p>
<p>Because of his narrow-mindedness, after marriage, I cut off relations and correspondence with my former boyfriend - unless he is his friend. I dare not mention any of their names, as this would make him jealous and hate me. Although it is said that this is his expression of love for me, I only feel that it restricts my freedom too much. Even my former male classmates dare not pay attention to me when we meet - alas! I feel that he is too selfish!</p>
<p>The whole morning is his time to write articles. Naturally, I dare not say a word to him. I drag my heavy belly and wash vegetables and cook rice downstairs back and forth. Sometimes, if the taste of the vegetables is slightly bad, he will complain, and he will not be considerate of you at all. Often I can't eat at all and I am full of grievances. But he still has to say: Go home, it's good to be a young lady at home, no one scolds you. Here, of course I will scold you if you do something wrong. I don't care, who else will care about you? What kind of words are these that make people feel so painful? And how discouraging they are! The spring is bright and the spring air is rippling on the earth, making people feel relaxed and intoxicated. At this time, he could no longer be confined in the pavilion room. He proposed to travel to the West Lake. Of course, I, who am about to give birth, should not move too much. I can only persuade him to go by himself, and I can take good care of myself. He was worried about me, so he didn't mention going again! However, when he is bored in the room, he will say that I am too involved with him and not giving him a chance to relax - alas! How cruel he is to say such words. I can only give him a bitter smile. Really, my heart has been broken into pieces! Now, he is shouting for divorce every day. May 1st is our wedding anniversary, and we agreed to separate on that day, which is actually divorce. He said he wouldn't care about the child, and I could do whatever I wanted with it. "What about the production fee?" "I'll leave you a hundred yuan," he said. Alas! I have nothing to say. This is what life is like after marriage! (To be continued)</p>
<p>Reading Introduction Ten Lectures on Women's Issues by Ziwen</p>
<p>Written by Hisao Honma, translated by Xi Chen Zhang, published by Kaiming Bookstore, 1.5 yuan. Women have always been in the position of "being made," but the progress of the times does not allow this to exist forever. Therefore, the issue of women has become an important issue in transforming the current society. The original work is by a Japanese scholar with comparative practical learning, and the translation is also very smooth. The book has a total of ten lectures, with sophisticated discussions on the origin and significance of the women's movement, love, marriage, divorce, and other issues. It can also be said to be a preliminary textbook for the women's movement. The translator's attached "The Intellectual Development of Chinese Women" is also included. It gives a detailed description of the misfortunes of Chinese women in the past, as well as the recent liberation movement.</p>
<p>Medical Q&amp;A Answer to Mr. Dong Gao Liu from Sishui County, Shandong:</p>
<p>Blood fluke disease is a translation of the German word Schistosomiasts. It has not been mentioned in Chinese medical books. Has the blood fluke disease you mentioned in your letter been diagnosed by a reputable doctor? According to the weather and geography, your place should not have this disease, so did you grow up in the south before? How are you suffering from this disease now? It is best to tell us in detail in your letter. Comparing the two types of injections, Stibosan is better. However, if the disease has been around for a long time and the liver and spleen have been swollen too much, even injections will not be very effective, so it should be used early.

<p>Shen Bao Amateur Weekly Amateur Talks: Our Understanding of Local Autonomy by Gongpu</p>
<p>Since the reporter has repeatedly written articles discussing the Shanghai municipal election, it has recently attracted the attention of all parties, which is very gratifying. However, there are several opinions that should be explained: First, some people think that paying attention to the concession area is too narrow. Of course, when discussing the election and the issue of Chinese representatives in the Shanghai municipal election, the minimum is to hope for the progress of Shanghai's municipality and the improvement of election methods. However, the reporter's purpose in making such a discussion is not limited to the corner of Shanghai, nor is it specifically referring to the Public Concession in Shanghai, which has complex international relations. However, the purpose is to use this municipal system with a considerable history as a basis for discussion, to encourage citizens' interest in the municipality, actively participate in the election, and further pay attention to national politics, so as to reduce obstacles to the future of democratic politics. Now the draft constitution has been promulgated. Many people in the country have made theoretical explorations on this brilliant national fundamental law, but if it only stops at research, it will not be of much benefit to the future of constitutional implementation. On the one hand, we hope that the country will have a good fundamental law, and the protection of civil rights can be established, but we also hope that the law is not a dead letter, but can be thoroughly realized in practice. Therefore, it is important to study the advantages and disadvantages of the constitution, but it is equally important to consider the gradual implementation methods in practice, otherwise the constitution will naturally become a dead letter and lose its spirit. We start from the municipal aspect to discuss the issue of elections. The purpose is to practically explore gradual implementation methods, because municipal issues are more closely related to citizens and are more likely to arouse citizens' attention and interest; at the same time, we also know that the implementation of a constitutional system in a country must start from one place.</p>
<p>Some people also say that now the general public can be said to be holding a kind of aversion, despair, negativity, and indifference to politics, thinking that there is no future for politics in our country. Of course, the pitch-black politics of the past 20 years can indeed make people pessimistic, and various high-profile reforms of politics have also been sung enough, but so far none of them have been realized. In this environment, the general lack of political interest, and the inherently weak political understanding of the Chinese people, it is not surprising that they not only dare not hold any attempts to improve politics, but are full of hatred and disgust. In addition, people below the middle class in the current society are all feeling the pressure of difficult life and the threat of unemployment and poverty. Therefore, the general public is busy trying to make a profit and solve the problem of food and clothing, so how can they have the leisure to care about politics! If this kind of mentality is not broken, it will only make politics worse, more unbearable, and more difficult to reform, until the country is destroyed. In the first article discussing the Shanghai municipality, the reporter quoted what Mr. Meng said that the Shanghai concession municipality was controlled by a small number of privileged classes, and strongly said that the reason for this phenomenon was that the citizens were too indifferent to politics. Therefore, if we want to improve the status quo, we should thoroughly eradicate the previous negative attitude and pessimistic psychology towards the Shanghai municipality, and replace it with a constructive spirit of actively seeking improvement methods.</p>
<p>The third opinion is that some people think that civic training is not easy to be effective under the current situation. Everyone knows that political reform cannot be achieved overnight. It must go through countless trials, improvements, and evolutions before there can be hope for gradual clarity. Take the United Kingdom as an example, although it is the most developed country in the constitutional system and its parliamentary politics are envied by the world, the fact is that its political shortcomings are still everywhere. But even this kind of politics cannot be achieved immediately. It has gone through a process of nearly 300 years of trial and improvement, and even had bloody revolutions at the beginning. Therefore, we must have a strong interest in studying politics and a enthusiastic courage to participate in politics. We must not be easily disappointed, nor should we have excessive expectations, hoping to reach the sky in one step.</p>
<p>We certainly hope that the public should have a long-term vision in political ideals, and everyone should actively discuss and study the gains and losses of political systems, but in the actual improvement of politics, we hope that the people can think about it from small things and gradually seek improvement methods. We should first start with the municipal reform of one place and then extend to the renewal of national politics. Although the constitution has not been implemented, local autonomy has been earnestly implemented by the central government in various provinces and cities. However, this important work does not seem to have been actively promoted in various provinces and cities. Their reason is that everything is unstable and there is no time to take care of it. But what about the achievements of local autonomy in more stable provinces such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang? This is really something they cannot explain. We must understand that local autonomy is the foundation for realizing democracy. Without the thorough realization of local autonomy, it is impossible to talk about constitutionalism. We should not blame the inefficiency of the government's work, but first blame ourselves for being too indifferent to the importance of local autonomy and too lacking in the ability to supervise the government. We should deeply realize that if the people completely rely on the government, cannot supervise it, and do not have the ability to exercise civil rights, then even if there are wise rulers, they will slowly become corrupt. Just look at the fact that even the autonomy of one county or city in China is not well done, so how can we talk about national democracy?</p>
<p>Life Sitting Surrounded by Books by Jixin - The Life of a Librarian -</p>
<p>The place where I live now is like a pigeon cage. "Book City," I find it funny when I think of this name. I give credit to those people who can have the leisure and time to think of this nice-sounding name. I am indeed sitting surrounded by books now, but my soul does not need such towering walls to protect it.</p>
<p>Walking into the door, there is an unbearable smell that rushes into your nostrils. A small rectangular room is divided into two parts. One side is the library, and I am locked in this place. One side is the reading room, which is for students to read books. There is a door in the middle that can be passed through. A four-foot-high cabinet is installed near the entrance. I stand inside the cabinet, just like a shop assistant. The customers who come here every day are all university students in the school. Rather than saying that these customers are more refined, it is better to say that these customers are more difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>Although my work is said to be only six hours, it is actually endless and can never be finished. From 1 pm to 5 pm, and from 7 pm to 9 pm, I have to serve to borrow books. Because of the restrictions in the rules, each person can only borrow one book at a time. Some people who are writing papers look at a dozen books in an hour. On normal days, there are fewer people reading books. When it comes to exams, this room is crowded with people. On average, these days account for the majority. So after the bell rings, in these few hours, I am always mindlessly drilling around in this pile of books. Especially at night, because of the stimulation of the intensity of the light, coupled with the daytime fatigue, even if a book is standing in front of me, I have to repeat it several times before I can distinguish it.</p>
<p>If I don't explain it in detail, you may think that I can still study on my own in the morning, but in fact the work in the morning is even more complicated. Every morning and afternoon, the tea room will send two packages from the post office. They are all bundles of books and newspapers; big and small, from institutions and schools, they have to be unpacked, the curled ones are pressed flat, and then the card boxes are taken to register them. Many new ones have to be divided into categories according to their nature. Sometimes, because Mr. Director wants to do extensive research, he runs to the old bookstore and buys many books by the pound and load, and puts them on the floor like a small pile of mountains. These endless burdens are all placed on my shoulders.</p>
<p>In such a place, using these times, doing this kind of work, who can not feel dry and tired? And how can I have the mood and leisure to enjoy myself?</p>
<p>Speaking of the treatment, it is also laughable. In terms of qualifications, I am certainly not comparable. Most of them here have at least a bachelor's degree, and some have even drunk foreign water. The working hours are the same, but the salaries they get are different. Some have twice as high as the low ones, or even three times as high. Some get ninety yuan, some get forty-five yuan, and some get thirty yuan. I am one of them. But I don't feel wronged, because there are also people with a bachelor's degree who get thirty yuan. There are even people with higher salaries who do less work. There is an Englishman who gets ninety yuan a month and only needs to work three hours a day. I don't know how this standard of treatment is set. The common saying, of course, is attributed to their knowledge - saying qualifications may be more accurate. But knowledge is not a glorious thing, if you have money to send your children to school, unless they are morons, I think anyone can do what they do.</p>
<p>Scientific Talks: Sunlight Machine by Tianhua</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has been engaged in the research on the utilization of solar energy (Sun energy) for a long time. In the Institute of Physics in Tashkent (in Central Asia, very close to Shule City in Xinjiang, China), through the efforts of scientists Cao Feimov and Fa Deyev, this knowledge has gradually been applied to daily practical life. In cold weather, using the glare machine they invented can keep the room temperature at 80 degrees; it can also be used for cooking, boiling soup, and brewing tea. In hot weather, through its sophisticated mechanism, the indoor air can be kept fresh and cool without change.</p>
<p>A simple sunlight machine is placed on the tail top. It rotates towards the sun. In this way, the solar energy collected in the machine is transmitted to the room for heating water, boiling eggs, warming the house and other tasks. Here, some skeptics may ask, what if there is a cloudy rainy day? There is no need to worry about this. The sunlight machine not only "collects" solar energy, but also "stores" solar energy for emergencies on cloudy and rainy days.</p>
<p>In winter, it may sound a little strange, the sunlight machine will store solar energy more efficiently than in the hot summer. This is because the sun's rays are purer (Purer) in winter.</p>
<p>Houses equipped with this type of sunlight machine are even more needed near the distant Arctic Ocean. The sun does not warm the ground in these cold places, but with the sunlight machine, it will warm the houses for the residents of these places. Solar energy can also be transmitted, for example, through underground pipes, it will not take much time to send it to the White Sea coast.</p>
<p>The utilization of solar energy is also extremely cost-effective. The sunlight machine described above costs only twenty to thirty rubles per unit.</p>
<p>Until now, the sunlight machine is still in the experimental stage. Although eight units have been applied and the performance is very good, the inventors are still unwilling to say that their efforts have achieved satisfactory results. However, they have explained to people with a determined attitude that in the near future, every household will have a sunlight machine on their roof, just like we now have a window or a door on the wall of our house.</p>
<p>This research is still being carried out in Tashkent, Uzbekistan (Central Asia). It seems to be a fantasy - to achieve such success without using many complex machines; but the fact is placed in front of us.</p>
<p>Small Monograph: A Review of the British Economy in the Past Year by Yao Ke</p>
<p>In 1933, the British economy showed great progress, whether in finance or in production.</p>
<p>According to a report by Reuters on the 17th of this month, the final settlement of the British fiscal year in 1933 was: income of 72</p>
<h3 id="e156">Document Presented to the Municipal Government <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>A document presented regarding the issuance of a proclamation by your esteemed government to resolve disputes over rice transportation, implement measures, address the current difficult situation, considering the financial burden of businesses, requesting postponement of implementation, and seeking compassion. It is with utmost respect that we read in various newspapers in this city on the 24th of this month, your esteemed government's proclamation regarding the dispute over rice transportation at the Zhabei rice market wharf. Now, based on the Social Affairs Bureau's continued submission, there are seven implementation measures to be proclaimed and ordered for compliance. The gist of the measures is to allocate welfare funds for workers from the original wages. The shortfall resulting from the allocation will be provided by the firms to the workers. In other words, the firms must bear the welfare expenses in addition to the original wages, which is extremely thoughtful for the workers. If the firms can afford it, there would be no objection. However, in the current social climate, everyone is deeply troubled. Since the January 28th Incident, firms have been closing down one after another. Those who have managed to survive are struggling to stay afloat. Encountering this misfortune, reviving and revitalizing the economy requires a comprehensive approach that considers both industry and commerce. Using this to benefit workers is akin to treating a boil by cutting away flesh. The firms cannot afford it, and the situation is unbearable. Moreover, the incident stems from the Shi Deng Society inciting a crowd to rob and seize rice transport, which is purely an act of external parties encroaching on the workers of the firms. Among the workers themselves, there is mutual understanding and harmony between labor and capital in this precarious situation. Therefore, the so-called welfare issue today is a problem arising as a consequence of the Shi Deng Society's robbery. It is clear that if the Shi Deng Society's robbery is deemed an illegal act, then the welfare issue arising as a consequence of the robbery cannot be tolerated or acknowledged. To tolerate or acknowledge this would be akin to advocating for illegal workers, and if such news spreads, all legitimate merchants will feel threatened. Furthermore, this welfare issue was not involved at the beginning of the case. Even in the four measures issued by the Social Affairs Bureau on January 5th regarding the resolution of disputes over rice transportation at the rice market wharf along the Wusong River, there was not a single word about this issue. It was not until the meeting convened on February 8th that it was mentioned. Since the association and others felt that commerce was declining and they were ultimately unable to cope, they never expressed approval. Moreover, on March 19th, they outlined the reasons why they could not bear the welfare expenses in a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting the Social Affairs Bureau to maintain the status quo, which is on record. Now, the Social Affairs Bureau is submitting to your esteemed government, claiming that it has obtained the consent of all parties, believing that the additional wages paid to the foremen are minimal and not difficult to bear, and requesting the issuance of a proclamation for compliance. Forcing people to do what they cannot do and compelling people to do what is difficult, the association and others in the same industry are truly fearful when considering the past and the future. Therefore, we do not hesitate to risk offense and lay out our grievances, requesting your esteemed leader to examine and consider the difficulties of merchants, and to grant a temporary postponement of the implementation of the aforementioned seven measures. Otherwise, the association and others in the same industry will be forced by livelihood and find it impossible to bear. Respectfully presented to the Mayor of Shanghai, Wu. Grain and Bean Industry Association Chairman Gu Xinyi, Rice Milling Industry Association Chairman Zhu Zixiang, Marketing Industry Association Chairman Zhang Songtao. Respectfully presented.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Cold Spring Harms Jiangzhe Silkworm Season <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that recent reports from Jiangzhe indicate damage to silkworms due to spring rains, resulting in illness, with silkworms unable to wake from their sleep and displaying symptoms of black spots and yellow discharge. Yesterday morning, the reporter met with He Shangping, head of the Shanghai liaison office of the National Economic Commission's Silkworm Improvement Association, who stated that due to the colder weather this spring, mulberry trees budded later, so the hatching of improved silkworm eggs was also later than in previous years. Currently, only a small portion of improved eggs have been hatched, and the results are excellent. As for local silkworms, because artificial suppression cannot be applied, some of the earlier hatched silkworms have suffered losses, but not to the extent of the various rumors.</p>
