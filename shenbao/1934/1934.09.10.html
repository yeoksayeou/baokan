<p>敬</p>
<p>美國是資本主義的典型國家。技術組織最優秀。天賦資源最豐富。所以在世界大戰中。發達最快。市塲的推廣。遍及全世界。幾駕英國而上之。日本在列强中稱後起。技術組織。雖精悍而短小。天賦資源。更特别薄弱。但是在以往大戰中。却佔到很大的便宜。樹立橫行東亞的基礎。一九二九年經濟恐慌襲來。美國始終浮沉於此經濟狂濤中。絶無解救的把握。日本則巳轉換方向。用對外的軍事開拓。來轉移國民的視綫。對内就以軍需工業來刺激市面。所以在表面的經濟情形、似較美國爲佳。然其實際。並無多大的差别。</p>
<p>美國實行産業復興法。巳經一年有餘。成績何如。吾人不用多批評。事實巳證明其並無多少效用。舊金山碼頭交通工人大罷工後。接着就醖釀紡織業工人罷工。參加運動的人員。有七十二萬。是美國有史以來的大運動。糾紛的主要原因。是勞資雙方。都不滿於復興法。勞工方面。要求實行團體交涉權。縮短工作時間。增加工資。而資本家方面。祇承認一個工廠的工會。而不肯承認總工會。同時如减短工作時間。卽要削减工資。且在事實上。棉毛織品存貨很多。市塲銷行。並不暢旺。假使罷工時間不太長。資方反而有利。所以有許多人。倒樂於聽工人罷工。借以减少生産。提高市價。</p>
<p>東京市電車工人的罷工。遠因由於大地震時所損失的五千餘萬元。到現在並没有彌補。近因爲其他各種交通。次第發達。利用電車的人數减少—一九二六年時。乘電車的人。全年有四萬五千萬。近二三年。跌至三萬萬左右。所以東京市電負債額數。超過二萬萬元日金以上。因此東京市電車收入。竟不能支付資本的官息和債務的本利。債上加債。乃陷於今日之窮境。於是市電車之營業。不得不設法整理。一方要增加收入。一方要裁减人員。其實在增加收入上。並没有甚麽積極方法。所謂改善工作。引誘乘客等。都是空話。於財政上補助很少。而工作人員的整理。却有很大的作用。在二千三百名的技師事務貴技手中要裁去四百名。電車夫賣票人技工信號手等一萬零八百名則全體解　照新規約重新雇用據電車局的計算。以爲在此一項可以節省三百萬日金。加上電力的節省。公債的整理。確可以填平當前八百萬元的「赤字」豫算。然而因此惹起東京交通勞動組合的大反感全電車工人罷工以示抗議。約計東京市電車每日的損失。至少須十萬元。</p>
<p>由這兩次罷工的原因和性質觀之。可以明白都不是單純的經濟問題加工資的糾紛。以美國論。主要的是勞工團體交涉權。次纔及於縮短工作時間。增加工資。復興法施行以來。對美國一般經濟。雖有相當的貢獻。但是力量很小。非特不能解救經濟危機。並且擴大了問題的範圍。日本自挑動九一八事變後。自以爲開疆拓土。穩持着東亞覇權。國民視綫。巳移轉到外面。國内的危機。可以掩蓋過去。那曉得農村經濟。瀕於破産。一般工業。也未見怎樣活潑。東京市電車。因折本無法彌補而至於罷工。足爲明證。</p>
<p>美國與日本。都欲極力彌補當前的罅穴。調和勞資間的糾紛和對立以企圖改善現狀。殊不知他們在本身經濟上政治上的種種矛盾依然日漸擴大。不能克服。縱令工潮能告平息。而困難問題。仍舊横亘在那裏。欲求解决。恐怕不容易罷。</p>

<p>俄入國聯部署完竣</p>
<p>大會三分之二票數確定</p>
<p>行政院常任席亦無問題</p>

<p>德意志的經濟新政策</p>
<p>切實履行農業政策以救失業人民</p>
<p>地方經濟與向外發展商業同重視</p>
<p>並主移都市人民於鄉村以增生産</p>
<p>國民新聞社德國通訊、德國國社黨秉政以來、不僅能改革政治狀態、並經濟狀態、亦巳力加改革、考之事實、改革經濟政策之實施、業巳頗有成效、是故德國之經濟政策、與世界有莫大之關係、國社黨無不竭力講求改革之方法、若經濟地位一變、則德國國際地位、亦因之而不同、故必須審愼考慮、今日失業之問題、若世界各國、均能解决、則世界經濟與政治情狀、當漸見繁榮、惟須留意者、蓋失業問題、爲目前經濟之轉動、及經濟組織變更之所致、自大戰後、無論德國或英國、其工業産品之出口、均不能恢復戰前之狀態、戰前之工業産品出口額、固時時見增、今則事實上已不見其增加、於是失業問題逐漸擴大、以致大戰時及大戰後經濟直接發生變化之時、各消費國亦自設工廠、開始製造、以致輸出品、已不如昔、銷路日小、收入銳减、</p>
<p>因此等不可掩飾之事實、國社黨以之爲經濟計劃之鑑誡、現在國社黨殫心於對外貿易、着着進行、以資充裕國内之經濟、期於最短時間内、達到目的、因此國民經濟不致紊亂、而德人須於此無可奈何之事實壓迫之下、解除内外之經濟困難、如此則德人自不能與世界經濟脫離、須知解决國内之經濟問題、斷不可與世界毫無連絡、惟須側重國内經濟而巳、然於對外貿易、則始終不可忽視、至於對某國貿易關係、或須多·或須少、一視各國之貿易情狀而定、</p>
<p>茲所論之問題、乃在應如何解决德國内部之經濟問題、其焦點在切實履行農業政策之計劃、德人現在對於地方經濟、固須重新整理、而於向外商業政策、尤宜切實奉行、使能獲多量之利益、以减少失業人數、將來不致减少工資、而工資之鞏固、亦不致動搖、今果欲達此目的、人人必須有向外發展之思想、如此則失業者可得復業、各自努力、隨處均有職業可就、在此計劃上、吾人可使大批失業者得以復業、因之人民之購買力、可以提高、</p>
<p>茲者德人首須明曉此非不整理地方經濟、一意建設大都市、實乃欲由大都市而及於小城市、易言之、卽按地方之需要而鞏固經濟之重要性、但此可否成功、事後始能知之、國社黨之經濟計劃、隨時隨地而異、積極負責以貫澈之、若此種計劃、果能實現、世界經濟、勢必受其影響、國社黨時時牢記不忘、欲於最短時期内减少一五○、○○○失業人數、此乃最大之事業、藉此可將購買力提高、俾德國内部經濟、日臻繁榮、而發展至於無限、但於此須有全體綜合之思想、國社黨之計劃、尙及於其他事項、卽整理經濟不純在經濟範圍内、此外尙注意政治與文化事業、故國社黨不惟對於經濟文化事業、並未稍忽、至德國東部、因人口稀少、以致久未有人經營之處、於政治上殊有危險、故亦宜實行移民、因都市之人民移入鄉村者逾多、則自然之産品自多、此種事業甚大、關係全國之民生問題者尤重、國社黨之經濟計劃、在力求步步合理、且適合於實施原則、實有空前絶後之能力、</p>

<p>隴西各縣與新省哈密之近况（續）</p>
<p>農村破産　農村破産之慘狀、更難罄述、田園荒蕪、無資耕種、選其中上并酌賠牛力人力、送人白種、惟請代納糧賦、竟無人應命者有之、日僅食小米稀粥、二餐或一餐有之、或此一二餐之小米稀粥、竟亦不得食、十三四歲之女兒、尙無褲穿、願以「一歲一金」之聘禮、以爲童養媳者有之、（汽車所到之處、鄉人麕集爭覩、彼輩無褲之姑娘、年齡較大者、或曲身側行、或席地遠視、情狀殊爲可憐）甲縣之農民、遠奔乙縣以賣工、而乙縣之少壯、又反來甲縣求「受苦」、輾轉流離、迄無定所者亦有之、詩有「千村萬落如寒食、不見烟火空見花」之句、蓋不啻爲今日隴西農村寫照也、夷考所以致此之由、原因雖甚繁多、但土劣得任意攤派農民之「寃枉捐」、殆爲農村破産之一大致命傷、所謂「寃枉」與「苛雜」不同、且較苛雜爲害、尤陰暗深烈、姑以臨澤縣第四區威狄堡、農民王有德所被派之四條「寃枉捐「單爲便、其一、「奉令公派每單出燈爐子」</p>
<p>四個、隨帶淸油、并栽燈夫一天」、其二、「奉令派每單應攤、成立區黨部照像及臨時車價、高等法院周委員宿膳制、區團總津貼、共四元、掛賬洋四角」、其三、「奉票派每單出五區送禮雜費、郵電費、印花車價及本區火食、共六元、其四、「奉公議仙姑會、獻戲十天、每單出錢十二千文、乾麵五斤」</p>
<p>關外三絶　安西之「風」、至爲迅烈、淸時例送新疆之恊餉銀車某次過此、曾被大風連人畜一共吹去、記者來者、亦遇大風數次、沙石飛擊車窓、錚錚之聲、至爲駭人、他如風吹流沙、能使平原變邱陵、邱陵變平原殆無疑也、吐魯番之「熱」、埋雞卵於沙中、貼肉片於石上、頃刻可成熟食、八里孔（鎭西）之「冷」、五六月尙飛雪霰、冬日小便、着地成冰、謂之關外三絶、俗將在新疆之冷熱二絶除去、另配以玉門之女、敦煌之經、殊覺不倫、又此間立秋甫過、氣候乍凉、土人巳着棉襖、此亦東南所無之氣候也、</p>

<p>第二十六期　申報流通圖書館讀書指導部編</p>
<p>目錄………我的讀書，經騐—高而讀書問答投票揭曉公開郵箱</p>
<p>我的讀書經騐</p>
<p>我是一個窮人家的子弟，自然進不了什麽新的學校，從小在家鄉，總算還曾讀過九年，三字經百家姓，認識幾個大字。我十六歲那年，因爲家裏窮的緣故，便離開了父母，跑到上海來當人家的學徒，在三年學徒的過程中，時常有機會看報紙、及那個時候所流行的鴛鴦蝴蝶派一類小說，但這些書報，對於我並没有多少益處，因爲他們所寫的，都是公子哥兒的戀愛生活，不然，便是什麽黑幕之類的東西，加之，那些書裏所用的詞句，典故，使我讀了莫明其妙，因爲我没有那樣的生活，所以，不能領會書中的原意，不能引起興味後來我感覺到這些旭書都不是我們學徒的，便終止不讀了，後來，我開始讀與我工作有關係的化學，物理等類的書，雖然有許多名詞不懂，但因爲這些書，倒切合我日常工作的需要，因此，稍許感到一些興趣，也得了一點益處。三年的學徒生活很快的過去了，接着便感到生活問題，人生問題。在這種情緖之下，我開始讀社會科學的書籍，可惜那時候社會科學書還不多，即使有，都是用文言文寫的，雖然讀，但感不着興趣，得不着益，這，自然是我不懂文言的緣故。後來便終止讀書，可是我表面上雖然終止了，我心裏還是熱烈的追求智識。在這種情形之下我每天工作完了，睡覺的時候，總要把日裏所遇到的看見的事情，慢慢的想，要把它想出一個道理來，否則睡不着。有時自己解决不了，就去問别人，同别人討論，這樣，我漸漸覺得有興趣，比讀一本書更實際些。譬如想起老闆虐待學徒的事情，以前總是一味的憤恨他們太無人道，後來深一層的看到這不是我們一家店裏的現象，原來社會就是一部分人虐待另一部分人，老闆並無人道不人道，天下烏鴉一樣黑：自己做了老闆也會一樣，於是想到這不是一人的問題，不過當時的認識是比現在說的還要膚淺。我自然還感着不足，我有時間還要找書讀，不過這時巳知道讀書要合我們實際生活，不白費時間，所以我在讀書之前，便想出以下的幾個問題：一·我們究竟讀什麽書好？二·什麽書切合我們的實際生活？三·讀了什麽書便能帮助我們生活？關於以上三個問題，就是我讀書的體騐，常常自己提出問自己，這樣一天天的摸索，纔明白讀死書是没有用的，知識要在實際生活中去尋求、社會上所存在的事物都是我們研究的材料，書本不過是我們研究這些材料的參考書。世界上不論什麽事物，都有牠存在的理由與條件，只要我們平心靜氣的研究，總可以找出它的因果關係來。（高而來稿）</p>
<p>讀書問答投票揭曉</p>
<p>我們非常感謝我們的讀者，凡我們的一切建議，都能給我們以回答，或是照做，或是提出反對。這對於我們的工作的進展上增加不少助力。這次徵求讀者對於「讀書問答」的投票，原不過自己想知道自己工作缺項，同時想知道讀者實際的要求到底是什麽，使我們的工作不致口裏反對人家做書獃子而實際上是指示人家做書獃子與他們的實際生活，距離太遠。茲將我們收到的投票，先爲揭示一部份如後：</p>

<h3 id="c7">核减鐡路運價與發展農村經濟（六）吳紹曾 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>在去年收成期内、京滬全綫上行運米、總數不過六千餘公噸、占全部産量之極少數、而此六千餘公噸、又大多數僅在本路範圍内運輸、其運往大江以北者、祇一千六百六十餘公噸、不足全數百分之二十八、亦足證長途運輸之不旺也、</p>
<p>（三）消費方面凡物以供求平衡爲良好之景象、尤以關係民生之農産品爲最、農産之消費地點、如供過於求、則其價低落、將使農民辛苦所得、不償所失、反之、如求過於供、則其價高昂、在農民固可獲利、而其他各界必有生活艱難之感、均非所宜、然中國早成世界尾閭、本國各地自給不足、適爲外貨造機會、故以農業著稱之國家、乃有向國外仰給農産品之怪象、據民國十九年米麫棉輸入統計如下、</p>
<p>米一九·九二一·一九一八（石）　一二一·二四四·七六六（海關兩）</p>
<p>麫五·一五０·三０七（擔）　三一·五五六·三八八（海關兩）</p>
<p>棉　三·四七四·八八九（擔）　一三三·一三五·五六七（海關兩）</p>
<p>三項輸入總值二萬八千六百萬海關兩弱、此外如外國進口之百果、據二十二年十二月份統計價值達三十三萬金元、以全年計之、又在四百萬金元、即國幣一千二百萬元以上、此其影響我農村經濟爲何如、溯其原因、無非由於主要生産地之供過於求、與主要消費地之求過於供、而究其所以致此求供失調之故、一則交通之梗阻、一則運費之高昂、否則即或有時仰求於外、故量亦决無如此之巨、可斷言也、</p>
<p>綜上所述、鐡路爲恊助發展農村經濟起見、對於多數農産品之運價、誠有澈底改訂之必要、似不妨由鐡道部指定與民生上、經濟上或國防上有重要關係之本國農産吕若干種、離開運輸成本特訂超乎一切之劃一低廉運價、即、</p>
<p>按照等級、分别規定每運輸一百公里每公噸（整車）或每五十公斤（不滿整車）運費若干、每二百公里若干、每三百公呈若干、每四百公里若干、每五百公里若干、（不滿百公里者槪照百公里計（五百公里以上、不分遠近、一律照五百公里計算無論本路運輸或各路聯運、一律照此辦理、至於運價之規定、可採下列步驟、</p>
<p>（一）考查各該種農産品之本身成本、（二）考查各種本國各該種農産品之普通市價、（三）考查國外輸入相等農産品之售價、（四）酌訂各該種農産品每公噸（整車）或每五十公斤（不滿整車）運輸一百公里、二百公里、三百公里、四百公里、及五百公里之最低運價、使各該種農産品於生産成本及運費相加後、尙不超過各市塲之普通市價、并能與國外輸入相等農産品競賣、（五）酌定自一百公里至五百公里之間、每增加一百公里應增加之百分率（務取便於計算之百分數）、（未完）</p>

<p>高級單打複賽</p>
<p>邱飛海苦戰勝鄭兆佳</p>
<p>五盤劇戰費兩點餘鐘始分勝負</p>
<p>第五盤鄭以五比一勝反遭失敗</p>
<p>▲羅伯杯複賽中華敗於美國</p>
<p>草地網球高級單打複賽之結果、卡爾生直落三勝馬達十分容易、邱飛海與鄭兆佳劇戰五盤歷兩小時餘、邱始得勝、且鄭可勝之機會甚多、均以少經騐而失敗、第一盤鄭曾以五比一局領前、往後竟連失六局、以五比七負、第五盤上鄭又以五比一局導前、且下局邱發球又負一比三（十五比四十、鄭僅須再勝一球、即勝邱飛海矣、詎料此一綫關頭、未能如願以償、反而一失再失、打成五比五平手、邱終以九比七勝最後之一盤、羅伯杯中美續賽、僅打五局、美以九比七勝第五盤、美葡之戰、因天晚改期比賽、各組成績如下、</p>
<p>（高級單打）卡爾生（六比二　六比○　六比三）馬達</p>
<p>（高級單打）邱飛海（七比五　六比四　五比七　三比六　九比七）鄭兆佳</p>
<p>（羅伯杯賽）卡爾生　史規亞（六比四　九比七　八比十　二比六　九比七）林寳華　邱飛海</p>
<p>羅伯杯中美續賽</p>
<p>羅伯杯複賽、中華對美國日昨各勝兩盤、第五盤至五比五局時、因天晚停止、昨日繼續在法商總會舉行、雙方小心翼翼、不敢造次、邱飛海發球、得勝一局、對手史規亞發球亦勝、林寳華發球又勝、卡爾生又成平手、成七比七、下局又爲邱發球、先勝三記後竟告失敗、美國乃以八比七佔先、史規亞之發球局、賴史之三次攔網成功、中華遂以七比九敗、</p>
<p>卡爾生戰勝馬達</p>
<p>高級單打複賽、卡爾生對馬達、勝負早在意料之中、卡爾生輕抽淡寫、以直落三勝、且僅失五局、馬達因林寳華之棄權而得複賽資格者、表演平平、一無可取、</p>
<p>邱飛海倖勝小鄭</p>
<p>邱飛海死裏逃生　邱飛海對鄭兆佳爲第三組登塲二人球藝無分軒輊、惟鄭缺少經騐、好來極好、壞來極壞、　勢鬆懈、球勢弛緩、興趣十分淡薄、開始後、霎時間、鄭即以五比一領前、邱隨夾隨去、僅招架而不還攻、蓋預知鄭之弱點、欲待其自殺也、初、鄭頗順利、自殺極少、故能一路順風、但往後則不然、一再送球入網、使邱飛海不勞而獲、連得六局、反以七比五歸邱勝利、第二盘艦邱先以三比一勝、鄭打成三比三、四比四、終以六比四仍爲邱勝、</p>
<p>鄭兆佳奮發有爲　第三盤上、鄭表演最佳、邱亦加足勁道、局勢遂見緊張、二比二後、鄭以沉重之發球、隨即上網、連勝四紀使邱一籌莫展、邱之發球局、亦被鄭以以上網取得、成四比二、鄭佔上風、邱亦猛力還攻、不若以前之守株待兎、候鄭自殺、未幾、邱又反以五比四居前、鄭不甘示弱、連下三局、以七比五奪回一局、休息後再戰、鄭一鼓作氣、以六比三勝、極爲容易、邱飛海面露倦容矣</p>
<p>邱飛海意外收獲　第五盤爲生死關頭、鄭先勝兩局、邱奪回一局、鄭之發球局上一人有極美麗之對角射擊、博得掌聲不少、爲最精彩處、鄭銳氣正盛、又得三局、以五比一遙佔優勢邱飛海精神暗淡、一籌莫展、鄭之最後勝負、似在掌握、且下局邱發球、巳負一比三、鄭僅須再勝一球、可以解决勝負、諒邱亦自認不敵矣、安知鄭一再自殺、即極易之球、亦均送入網内、而邱則穩健如常、雖不能用兇球抽殺、至少能回過網去、鄭重演　一盤之覆轍、被邱打成五比五、邱發球、鄭勝滑四、以爲鄭猶可獲勝是盤内下局爲鄭發球也、豈知亦失發球局、乃成六比六、邱則以得發球局而以七比六反佔優勢、鄭雖造成七比七、終以七比九失敗、惜哉、時大色將晚、英葡之羅伯杯雙打、不及舉行而改期、</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>第一回　鬼載一車關中來遠客家徒四壁渡口吊秦人</p>
<p>常秘書道：老百姓在地　找不出東西來，不能白白餓死，自然還要由别的方　把東西去換錢，買了糧食來吃。若論到變錢，鄉下人除了衣服農具，還有什麽？農具是都市裏人不要的，鄉下不能種地，大家窮，也没有誰買農具。衣服呢，這裏人，一件衣服可以穿半輩子，賣也無衣可賣。所以他們只有兩條竭澤而漁的路，其一是把牲口賣了，其二是拆下窗戶門板，以及屋頂上的屋梁，用車子推了，送到城裏去賣。拆屋梁賣，那是鄉下人最後的一着棋，賣了就逃荒去了。村子裏走一家就拆一家。有的人來不及拆，早走了，事後也有人代辦，所以村子裏常常變成只有墻没有屋的怪現象。爲了這件事，陜西人對於古書上形容窮人窮到家徒四壁這句話，來了一個莫大的證明。眞正家裏只有四堵光壁子了。程志前道：眞有這樣苦！現在離十八年大旱，也有六七年了，怎麽還没恢復過來？常秘書道：談何容易？說着，又搖了兩搖頭道：這也不是三兩句話說得盡的。張介夫聽了，心想，若是這種情形，還是在省城裏找一個位置罷，外縣恐怕太苦。李士廉也心想，地方這樣窮，老百姓决不吃葷，抽烟吃酒，大槪也隨便，屠宰稅，烟酒稅，大槪都湍有什麽出息。程志前聽說農村這樣苦，格外注意沿路情形，張李二人也各因觸景生情，各有各的心事。那位奉陪的常秘書，也不便多言，在大家默然無語的當兒，汽車穿過了一個寨子，在這寨子裏，也有幾家是家徒四壁的。（一五）</p>

<p>— （餘聲）</p>
<p>女人在臉髮上搽粉洒香水，常事，不足怪：這是一爲悅己者容一所應有的現象。但來路貨的香水竟會擦到粉腿上，這使我感到世風確在「日下，而世間男子們的嗅覺，也日趨下流了！</p>
<h3 id="c13">都市的成功人 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>誰都知道勤儉是「成功的路；一可是都市裏成功的路是很多，不單是「勤」儉」兩條路呀。也許只知道走這兩條路，未必成功；碰壁的時候，容或有之。</p>
<p>在三十年前，有ＡＢＣ三個小癟三，天天在Ｓ市度其流浪的生活，拾荒，拾香烟屁股，拉黄牛過橋，是他們唯一的職業。有一天，没錢買點心來充飢，肚子餓的吱吱　雷鳴。Ａ癟三從容地跑到粢飯攤，想賒一百二十錢三糰粢飯，以便三人分食。粢飯攤老闆，把兩只眼晴一瞧，見是小癟三，那裏肯賒給他。Ａ癟三没精打采地跑回，商量對付的方法。ＢＣ兩癟三跑到那粢飯攤前，借端打起架來，Ａ癟三乘機搶了一把銅圓，拔脚便逃；ＢＣ兩癟二也一轟而散。這回斷炊問題，終算解决。</p>
<p>有一年冬天，這三個癟三，忽然交了紅運。雪光裏照見一個老頭兒，酒氣薰人，一蹺一拐的走進弄裏來。他們見老頭兒，酒喝得爛醉，神志不很淸楚；老不客氣，一擁而上，實行他們拿手好戲的「剝猪玀」工作。也是他們命該交運，除剝了灰鼠褂兒，狐坎長袍以外、又在衣袋裏攫着三百多元的鈔票。弄得三個癟三眼花撩亂；笑得兩隻眼兒合不攏來。那老頭兒還湖裏糊塗，以爲有人和他打繩，掙扎了一回，便倒在地上，像死豬一般。</p>
<p>ＡＢＣ三癟三從此一帆風順，各人把发得的錢，做了基金，除做些正當買賣之外，不時仍做些特種買賣。到如今，這三位老兄，都有了家産，姨太太汽車。每天的進欵，委實不少咧。</p>
<p>「戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同」。像ＡＢＣ癟三的成功，不是走另一條路嗎？現在靑年們都喊着「失業」「飢餓」「不景氣，」眞是不會「打冷門」的一個懦</p>
<h3 id="c14">盂蘭勝會 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 顔波光</p>
<p>給迷信籠罩了的農村，今夏因了天氣亢旱，紛紛的把龍王抬出來求雨咧，把銅觀音放在烈日下曝晒咧，鳴鑼擊鼓，天天迎神賽會，直到如今，依然滴雨未下，反把飄秋的季節都忘懷了。禾田的裂縫有五六寸闢，等着補種的食糧，像喬麥咧，菉豆咧，……都不能下士，眞急得手足無措。</p>
<p>一般農人，看看秋收没有了希望，謠言蠭起，什麽殭屍作怪咧，過陰兵咧，說了許多迷信話，不值識者的一笑！</p>
<p>家中没有米子煮飯倒是不要緊，盂蘭勝會却是一椿頂大的事情。每家都當去了衣服，凑集錢來，雇幾員和尙，誦經唸佛，聲音嘹喨，梵音搭配，又糊了許多紙衣紙袴和紙紥的器具焚化，把有用的金錢虚擲在無影無蹤之中。相信佛法無邊，能替災黎解除一切苦厄，靠天吃飯。自己却情願嚼着草根樹皮，眞是愚得可笑。</p>
<p>廢歷七月專據說是一個鬼的季節，往年也有佛事和燒化的。可是今年連人都没有錢用没有米吃，一般人仍是很起勁的，天天做着盂蘭會，——打公醮——寗非咄咄怪事嗎？連楮頭錫箔的燒化，損失金錢更有可觀！</p>

<h3 id="c16">摩登攷異 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 姚仲寅</p>
<p>摩登二字，在中國收來已舊，通作時髦解！以時髦爲摩登，愈摩登，愈有害！查法國原文，摩登譯爲現代，以現代爲摩登，愈摩登，愈有益！余於此不能無感；嘗謂凡事在外國俱良，一到中國便壞！不獨摩登二字爲然，汪院長雖力爲矯正，無如積習巳深，相沿不悟，非澈底根本改革，决難收效，余試爲探其始，遏其流，覺其迷，指其失，物極必反，或未必終無望乎！</p>
<p>攷莫愁湖志卷六，鬱金堂詞證，車秋舲望海潮詞，内有二句云：「賸摩登妙相，周昉能描」，摩登二字，見於詞人手筆，摩登而曰妙相，確指女子而言，此詞原爲題莫愁湖盧家少婦而作，據以歷代名畫記，及宣和畫譜，「周昉，字景玄，善書婦女，多爲豐厚態度」，至鬱金堂詞證，爲淸嘉慶時馬菊村所輯，知摩登二字，沿用固巳久也。</p>
<p>又攷楞嚴經：「釋迦從弟阿難，遇摩登伽女，攝入淫室，將毁戒體！」摩登伽名，鉢吉帝，淫女也！阿雖旣爲佛弟，以佛弟而遇淫女，豈淫女亦爲佛之化身歟？阿難譯言歡喜，歡喜佛與摩登伽，兩相會晤，豈近今雍和宮之歡喜佛，即此佛之變相歟？摩登伽爲淫女，世人亦何取乎此，而必競尙摩登，佛之本意，原在普渡衆生，其亦以此示警歟？佛書又言「男子稱摩登伽，女子稱摩登祗一，鉢吉帝爲摩登伽女，摩登伽女，與摩登女子，一而二，二而一，仿效非無自也。</p>
<p>中國之摩登如此，外國之摩登如彼，中國講究摩登，日漸退化，外國講究摩登，日漸進化，見解不同，行爲互異，事實遂大相懸殊；中國事事落伍，不及外國，并談到摩登，亦不及外國遠甚，非但遠不及外國，且與外國背道而馳，以譌沿譌，誤伊於何底！欲正其誤，以現代二字，挽救時髦，爲時髦女子，不如爲現代女子，現代女子所需要者：敎育·職業·常職·不可缺少；努力新生活運動衣食住行，提倡國貨，崇樸素，愛淸潔，守儉約，尙幹練，斯不愧爲現代之女子！斯不愧爲現代眞正之摩登女子！今日研究摩登者，除舊布新，要不可不明辨之也！</p>

<p>它所發生的兩層效用是：（一）和天津車站隔離，（二）使太后的玉趾不致沾到尋常人所踐踏過的泥土。不用說，想出這一個計劃來的人，必然是一個很聰明的脚色！讀者諸君，你們試猜，這個聰明的脚色是誰呢？提起這個人的大名，我想不會再有不知道他的人吧？原來此人非别，乃是將在中國歷史上永遠佔到很重要的一頁的項城袁世凱先生！其時，他正當着直隷省的總督。他在太后没有從北京啟程南下之前，巳早就决定了要舉行一次盛大的接駕典禮，和另行建造一座新月臺的大計劃了。</p>
<p>這座月臺的長度很長，雖不能停靠整列的御用列車，但也足敷十輛車之用了。它的上面，搭着一座用蘆蓆所蓋就的竹蓬，蓬上滿掛着無數的龍旗，和其他的旗幟，還有五色繽紛的彩條，靑翠的松柏，以及各色各樣的宮燈，點綴得着實美麗動人。地上當然是遍鋪着金子一般的黄沙。而在中央的一方土地上，另外又鋪着一張杏黄色的毛氈，這就是整備給太后下車後駐足之所。不過他們雖然是這樣的設計着，但太后到了天津，是否眞的願意下車，却没有人敢斷定：就像袁世凱那樣權傾中外的大臣，也不敢說「太后非在這裏下車不可」。</p>
<p>月臺是新建的，地下有黄沙，頂上有燈彩輝煌的蘆篷，這樣子自然是非常的華貴了！我們老遠就從車窗外探頭出去張望，大家都覺得十二分的悅目，不禁爭着要觀看；而我們的列車却都巳漸漸地在準備要停下來了。（一二四）</p>

<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>牽强言之。風傷營者。乃今之空氣傳染諸病也。蓋風非能爲病。風之爲病。以其挾穢也。宋玉風賦曰。「夫庶人之風。塕然起於窮巷之間。堀堁揚塵。勃鬱煩寃。衝孔襲門。動沙堁。吹死灰。駭溷濁。揚腐餘。邪薄入甕牖。至於室廬。故其風中人狀直憞溷鬱邑。毆温致濕。中心慘怛。生病造熱。中脣爲胗。得目爲蔑。」餘杭章師以爲風之致病。卽在駭溷濁揚腐餘。使病原微生物得飛揚空氣之中。以播種於人體也。此言可謂能揭風之隱矣。所謂善言古者。必有騐於今也。空氣中旣有病原微生。物飛揚而中於人。或自口鼻吸入。或附着於皮膚損傷之口。則溷入組織細胞液内。由淋巴管而入血。以成諸種之病。如腥紅熱。如麻疹。如痘瘡。如流行性感冒。皆是也。然則空氣傳染之病原菌。多由淋巴之媒介而入於血。以是爲風傷衛。未始不可。然至於發病之時。則因病菌入血之後。繁殖魄類。産生毒素。以致發病。不得仍認爲淋巴之病矣。其證候。則視其所染之病之個性而異。其療法亦視其病所加害之點而殊。豈可以風傷衛而主以桂枝。爲三綱之一哉。</p>
<p>由上之言。旣知寒傷營非傷寒論。太陽篇之傷寒。又知風傷衛非桂枝證之中風。則共第三綱所謂風寒兩傷營衛者。根本不能成立。其妄可不待言而知矣。</p>
<p>三綱鼎立之說。昔人亦有知其非者。柯韻伯是也。易風傷衛寒傷營之名而代以桂枝證麻黄證之目。此法蓋本諸孫眞人千金翼用桂枝湯法。用麻黃湯法之意。而暢其流極其變者。徐靈胎傷寒類方也。徐氏傷寒類方序曰。「傷寒論當時巳無成書。乃叔和之所搜集者。雖分定六經。而語無詮次。陽經中多陰經治法。陰經中多陽經治法。」又曰。「當時著書。亦不過隨證立方。本無一定之次序也。」此言余極以爲是。蓋仲景之書。當時之方案耳。施治不必一人。疏方不定一時。隨證隨地而立方耳。卽非盡出於仲景一手。則亦自序中所謂博採衆方而成。乃古人之方案耳。施治亦不必一人。疏方亦不定一時。亦隨證隨地而立方耳。後之學者。不知此義。而顚倒之。錯亂之。更易前後。審辨眞僞。務使上下啣接。聯爲一氣。以演成特别之條貫。此則後人之傷寒論。而非仲景之傷寒論也。以爲是可以得仲景原文之本來面目。不亦遠乎。自方中行而下。僕僕然不憚煩瑣。眞所謂庸人自擾者矣。</p>
<p>太陽篇中三綱鼎立之外。最爲諸家所聚訟者。桂枝湯也。自來醫家。皆謂仲景之法。有汗用桂枝。無汗用麻黃。且因傷寒論有「桂枝本爲解肌。若其人脈浮緊。發熱。汗不出者。不可與也。」之言。於是遂謂桂枝湯之「歠熱稀粥。温覆。令遍身微似有汗。」之法。爲桂枝解肌之法。而以解肌專屬之桂枝。徐洄溪號爲能讀古書。亦持此說。餘子何論焉。深師方有麻黃解肌湯。見外臺卷一。其藥四味。其分量煎法服法。悉與仲景麻黃湯同。惟桂枝作桂心耳。且其後有注曰。「本仲景麻黄湯。」又外臺卷三。載肘後麻黃解肌湯。其藥無桂。是麻黃解肌。古人所通知。故别錄述麻黃之用。而有「解肌」三字也。肘後又有葛棍解肌湯之名。由是。可知後世之以解肌專屬桂枝。囂囂然發舒空論者。皆目光如豆。坐井觀天者之言也。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（三十八）蛔蟲病和蟯蟲病</p>
<p>（問）這兩種蟲類組織寄生在人體的那一部分？</p>
<p>（答）都是寄生在腸中的。</p>
<p>（問）蛔蟲的形態怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）蛔蟲的形態，很像蚯蚓。雄蟲長二○糎，雌蟲長四○糎，粗五耗，色淡紅。</p>
<p>（問）蛔蟲怎樣傳染到人體内呢？</p>
<p>（答）是由於不潔的水中或野菜上所附着的蟲卵，嚥下到腸内而起。蟲卵進入腸内之後，孵出幼蟲，通過腸壁進肝臟的門脈，達肺臟，經氣管再進食道達小揚而寄生在這裏。</p>
<p>（問）蛔蟲卵的形態怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）呈卵圓形，帶黄色，具有二層輪廓的卵殼，殼面粗糙隆起，内部有顆粒。</p>
<p>（問）蛔蟲寄生後的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）有時不呈什麽病狀。有時大便中混有潛在性的出血，或訴空腹痛，有時病人呈貧血病狀或起腸炎病狀。倘多數蟲體集結時，大便秘結腸管壅塞。有時侵入輸膽管而起黄疸，或成肝膿瘍。</p>
<p>（問）蛔蟲病的治療方法，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）内服山道寗，成人一天的用量，○·一—○·三克，連用三日後，服瀉劑，使他瀉出。小兒用量，用○·○二—○·○四克。此外可用海人草，每天用量一○—三○克做煎劑内服。連用二三天。</p>
<p>（問）蛔蟲和他的卵子的形態怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）蛔蟲是絲狀的小蟲，雄蟲長四耗，雌蟲長十至十二耗；蟲卵像蠶豆狀，長徑○·○五幅○·○二耗。</p>
<p>（問）傳染的徑路怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）蟲卵達胃中之後，迅速發生而産幼蟲，聚集於小腸和盲腸中。到成熟期，漸次移行到直腸中。卵子成熟的時候，雌蟲出肛門而産卵在肛門的附近。</p>
<p>（問）患了蟯蟲病的人，發生什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）被蟯蟲寄生的人，肛門部起煩癢，夜間尤甚。在女子陰部起瘙癢，或因夜間失眠致起神經病狀的。</p>
<p>（問）蟯蟲病爲什麽不易全治？</p>
<p>（答）因爲肛門附近的蟲卵，因手指搔爬癢處，再由手指傳入口内而起第二次的自體傳染。這樣反復不止，所以似乎不易全治。</p>
<p>（問）預防的方法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）爲防止自體傳染起見，禁止用手取食。夜間把兩手穿手套，或紥縛。</p>
<p>（問）治療蟯蟲病的方法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）第一用灰白軟膏（就是水銀軟膏）塗抹肛門周圍。每星期用百分之十的食醋，或一百倍到三百倍的鹽酸奎寗液，千倍的鞣酸液，二百倍的柳酸液，洗腸。内服駢困　，山道寗等驅蟲藥。服藥的前夜，宜先服瀉劑使腸内空虚，較易收效。</p>
<h3 id="c21">怎樣除去飛到你眼晴内的灰沙 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 吳之理譯</p>
<p>時常有灰沙或是其他的外界物飛進我們眼内，很是討論。一定要等到想到除去以後，痛苦才能停止。所受的痛苦和流了多量的眼淚，利害的能使你終夜失眠。如果我們不設法除去牠的話，就有發火而至於更麻煩的眼淚發生了。</p>
<p>當煤灰侵入的時候，切不可閉眼。不閉眼雖然很難，因爲閉眼是一種敏捷保護眼晴的反應；然而這種閉眼是非常急促而且用力很大，反而要將灰沙壓入深些。所以我們要閉着眼睛，或者用手（乾凈的手，將上下眼皮分開，讓天然要來的眼淚流出，那時灰沙或能浮出眼外，或者能够深解在眼淚的酸性中。如此約一分鐘，而後輕輕合攏你的眼晴。倘使仍然覺得眼内有物，你就應該放正你的頭。眼向下視，將上眼皮朝下拉，拉到下眼皮的外面。在這個位置時，你須自動的將眼球向上轉，而後鬆手，讓上眼皮退到她固有的地位。爲什麽要如此做咧？因爲灰沙倘使是在上眼皮之下的話，（最普通的情形），當上眼皮退上的時候，下眼皮的邊緣能够將灰沙磨刮出來。如果不能成功，可以多試幾次。</p>
<p>如果用了上面所說的方法，還是不行；我們就可知道，這外來的不速客大約是跑到瞳仁前很薄的眼角膜裏去了。到了這個所在，就不可自己亂動。我們所應做的，只是到一位醫生那兒去。不要貪便宜而到一位藥劑師或理髮匠那邊去解除你的困苦。因爲你的眼晴是太值錢了。你有一部漂亮的汽車，你决不會駛到小菜塲去出風頭，到那裏反而弄髒你的汽車。所以你决計不能要無知識和無經騐的人們來解决你的痛苦。</p>
<p>不但煤灰可用以上的方法來醫治，平常眼毛和鐡屑入眼等等，皆可以如法治愈。計多翻砂的工鋪子裏的工人，他們往往不當心或者不帶上避灰眼鏡；於是乎，熱的鐡屑就會光臨到他們的眼内。當時雖然痛一下子就不痛了，因爲鐡片的熱度已將眼角膜上的神經尾燒死；然而數小時後，劇痛又起，而且眼淚流個不住。這是因爲神經細胞又在復生，因之她傳達的功能亦復原了。在這些工鋪中，時常有一位自信能包治這種眼疾的工友，他怎麽辦呢？他身邊常藏着一柄鋒利的小摺刀，專爲此用。他用他的泥手將他的寳刀從他那汚穢的袋中取出後，呌受害者睜着眼晴不許關閉，直待他將鐡屑剔出爲止。平常人的眼晴，不能老是睜着，總會關閉；因爲眼角膜是最薄而且受剌激的感覺機能最是靈敏。所以刀尖一碰着她，眼晴因反應就要合攏。有是碰着這位工友和受害者的運氣高，一下子就取出來了，平常總要幾次。幾次一來，眼角膜就要破裂。一破裂，發炎的危險就來了，因爲刀子没有消毒。如果一發炎，整個的眼晴入了危險的狀况。最淺的程度是潰爛，視覺糊塗而至於失明。所以，親愛的工友們！你不要讓人亂弄你寳貴的眼晴。</p>
<p>不但工人有此危險，就是我們在路上走，孰鐡屑入眼的希望也是很多。在路上會遇見鑽鐡眼的工匠。鐡屑往往要從他鑿子下飛到你的眼内。凡是二鐡猛力相觸，熱鐡屑就會産生出來。附近如果没有醫生，倘有鐡屑等入眼的事發生，我們自己可設法來暫時保護一下。假</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>使你有硼酸油膏，或軟石臘（未曾飽和過炭酸者），可敷些到眼内，然後合起你的眼晴。油膏是有潤滑的功能，可以使眼角膜不會再受鐡片在内磨擦的損傷。如果你没有二種藥的話，你可放一些菎麻子油，或是橄欖油或是菜油在一個小杯子内，而後在沸水中煮約一刻鐘，（不可讓水濺到油内）。等到油全冷後，請人慢慢傾入你的眼内。最好是用滴藥管，其次是消毒過（煮過）的茶匙。每次一二滴就够了，太多的話反而剌激着眼晴。油進去了就可合住眼晴；最好雙眼全開着。因爲一個眼睛的轉動一定有影響到第二個眼晴，有了影響，就有剌激。</p>
<p>所以，朋友們，當你出門的時候，最好常帶着一些硼酸油膏放在眼藥管内。遇事發生的的時候，用藥管直接將藥敷進你的眼内。不要用火柴，牙籤或手帕角來代替。最要緊的乃是不可用眼石或菜子來放在眼内，而希望她在内亂動將鐡屑擊出。比如我們用一個大炸彈來炸去一個小樹，這棵樹雖然除去了，然而四周圍的東西都受了損失。所以你須强記着，當有灰沙或鐡屑進了你的眼晴，如果用我最先所說的法子不行，就應立刻去找醫生，不然就有發炎而至於殘廢的危險。</p>
<h3 id="c22">頭痛治療法 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>頭痛這種毛病是很平常的。故市上頭痛藥充斥。普通人頭痛了就去買頭痛藥止痛。很少人去問問爲什麽頭痛。但現在是二十世紀科學昌明醫學進步一日千里的時代。我們應當利用新醫學的知識去研究明白爲什麽頭痛。我們必須知道頭痛的原因才能去根本治療頭痛。不然頭痛服頭痛藥不過是敷衍了事並不是根本的辦法。每次頭痛服頭痛藥。如果過多還可把身體弄軟弱。最新的醫學是先尋出病原再對症治療故能百治百愈。此卽本篇内合理的治療法之意義。茲述頭痛的原因於後。</p>
<p>（甲）頭痛由身體内有毒質。例如。</p>
<p>（一）有病發熱時身内生毒質病者常頭痛。</p>
<p>（二）身内自生毒質。如。大便閉結。大腸將毒質吸到血内。故大便閉結的人常是頭悶痛。</p>
<p>（三）身内廢料增多。由腎排洩功用不完好。故患慢性腎炎（Ｎephritis）的常有頭痛。</p>
<p>（四）肝硬化過甚或有别種破壞肝的病阻礙或减少肝排毒的功用的。也常有頭痛。</p>
<p>（五）甲狀腺有病時也有頭痛。</p>
<p>（乙）頭痛由於血脈病。例如。</p>
<p>（一）心臟發火。（二）血流不暢。（三）血壓高。所紀較高兼身體肥胖的人頭痛。不少是由於血壓高。（四）老年人血管硬化也常有頭痛。（五）貧血的人常頭痛。由於腦中血不充足。（六）重肺病也頭痛。（七）梅毒。老梅毒特别呌人頭痛。</p>
<p>（丙）頭痛由於局部病。例如。</p>
<p>（一）眼受累（ＥyeStrain）如近視遠視眼面不平與眼發炎。注意。這是頭痛中一個特别平常的原因。（二）耳鼻喉發炎。（三）腦膜炎神經病。（四）子宮病與子宮位置不正。</p>
<p>合理的治療法</p>
<p>由上面看來欲根本解頭痛必須先知道頭痛的一定原因。茲分述於下。</p>
<p>發熱頭痛治發熱。發熱病好了頭目不痛。</p>
<p>大便閉結。每日通大便。法。食物多含渣滓每日容易大便。如係老閉結習慣可服通大便藥。</p>
<p>有腎病的須治腎病。有肝病的須治肝病。有甲狀腺病的亦須治療。</p>
<p>如果有服藥過多習慣的須停服無益藥品。</p>
<p>有心臟病與心臟發炎的須將心病治好。血流不暢的使血流暢。</p>
<p>血壓高的須治療。使血壓降低。如改良飲食帮助排洩。血壓降低了不但頭痛没有了連中風的危險也没有了。</p>
<p>貧血的當請醫生找出貧血的原因。先除掉貧血的原因再治療貧血。貧血愈頭自不痛。</p>
<p>因肺病頭痛的須治肺病。</p>
<p>頭痛的人曾有過梅毒的不要忘記須注射治療梅毒。</p>
<p>局部原因中眼毛病爲最要緊。並且在一切的原因中也佔重要位置。近視遠視散光的人看書做細工較别人費眼力大故生頭痛。配相當眼鏡就可以治好這種頭痛。學生與用眼多的人不可不明白這種病理。</p>
<p>如因耳鼻喉病神經病而頭痛的除去病原頭痛自愈。</p>
<p>婦女如因子宮病或子宮位置不正的治好子宮病或將子宮位置改正頭痛便可斷根。</p>
<h3 id="c23">兩肺空洞之治療 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>人工氣胸與橫隔膜神經截斷術及肋骨截除手術合併施行之</p>
<p>吾人在臨床上，往往遇兩肺結核空洞性患者，其治療最感困難，蓋日光空氣營養休息諸療法，雖爲治肺之大助力，然至是則不能發揮其固有之功能，而對症療法，更不免藥石罔靈之嘆，於是坐視患者日就危殆，呻吟床第，人生慘境，殆無有逾於此者矣。</p>
<p>古時有肺癆必死之說，以其無特效藥可以撲滅肺結核菌也，現代醫學雖日趨昌明，而自肺結核菌發現以後，其特效藥迄未發明，然吾人在療養院中，對於單面肺病，自施行各種手術以後，其治療成績，至堪驚人，雖不能謂爲完全有效，然重者以之輕，輕者以之愈，咯血者因之停止，高熱者因之消失，至於體重加增，痰量减少，更數見不鮮，其間有復發者，或限於經濟，未能得充分之治療，或忽視其平時之攝生所致，而其大槪之成績，對於單面之肺結核，堪稱佳良，惟對於雙面（兩肺）之肺結核，則尙無優良之療法，最近余在上海肺病療養院，對於兩肺空洞之患者，曾有合併手術之施行，今約述如下。</p>
<p>某君二十八歲，全身狀狀態並不佳良，肺病巳三年餘，咳嗽咯痰甚多，痰中發現結核菌，愛克司光圖上，左肺上半全爲陰影，可聽見水泡音，試行人工氣胸無效，因肋膜粘　之關係，遂先行橫隔膜神經截斷術，然此神經截斷術，於此例亦不能有優越之功效，不過於肋骨截斷術（卽左肺上部完全停止工作）之前，預防危險起見，故行神經截斷術，先使左面橫隔膜輕微上昇，以减少左肺呼吸工作。</p>
<p>然後余與外科醫師將左肺上部後面之肋骨，成一三角形式截去四根，上狹而下廣，左肺上端之患部，本因肋膜粘連不能壓縮者，至是遂告崩潰矣。</p>
<p>同時因右肺上部發見空洞，於肋骨截除術之前二日，施行微量人工氣胸，至今尙在繼續施行治療中，迄今二月餘，一切自覺他覺症狀，均已進步不少，現赴鄉間靜養云。</p>
<p>至於預後如何，在此極短時期内，尙難預料，倘能療養得宜，診治合法，要亦大有就痊之望，是在患者繼續之努力耳，此種手術療法，以視本來之内科療法，束手待斃者，相去遠矣。</p>
<h3 id="c24">肺結核淺說（二十） <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>（五）痰一提到咳嗽，尋常馬上都會想到多痰的，這二種症象幾乎和姊妹行一樣的；雖然有些人們但有乾咳，而痰是很稀少的。在肺結核症病勢開始的時候，大都痰量是很少的，他是純粹粘液性或粘液透明狀的，這種痰完全由氣管枝發炎而來，特殊是由肺門腺體方面，這時期的本病，大都係閉鎖性。但卽使有時痰中發現結核菌了，也不會一定是例外的。到了病勢逐漸前進了，他的痰大半是粘液帶膿性，但其間的膿和粘液，並不融合細密，和氣管枝炎氣管枝擴張兩病一樣的。這一種膿質，大半是肺部發生空洞的關係：他本來是很衡薄而帶流動性的，當他向上通過氣管枝氣管的時候，會被粘粹包裹住而分别凝聚的，結果成爲線條狀球狀貨幣狀幾種不同的形態；這就是我們平常所謂的球形痰和貨幣狀痰了。這空洞裏面發生的膿體，除大多含有結核菌外，其他的釀膿菌，像葡萄球菌連鎖球菌四聯球菌肺炎菌等，都時常發見的；尤以連鎖球菌在混合傳染中的意義是特别重要的。</p>
<p>（六）欬血　這是一個「談虎色變」的症象。一般的病家們，假使他發現咳嗽多痰了，甚至身體也較前消瘦了，大都視爲無足重輕毫不介意的：但如果痰中是發現鮮血絲了，他們大槪都知道不容再緩了，差不多馬上會去尋醫生想法子的。這一種情形，在我國的一般社會是非常普遍的。其實事實上並不盡然的。我們要曉得，肺結核病因大量出血而致直接發生生命危險的例證是很少的，遠不及胃潰瘍肝硬變二症那樣的多：再則欬血的發生，並不是一定在肺結核病嚴重的時候，在本病的開始也很多發現的。這一種初期欬血，預後並不一定是惡劣的，有時病者因此而不敢再馬虎了，長期療養和根本的治療也樂於接受了，就是醫生關照的話也不作等閒視了，結果因之而痊愈，事實上的例證，反而是很多的。所以欬血這一個症象，無疑地是給病人的一個嚴重警告：但這個警告，我敢大胆說一句，他决不是無的放矢的，有時反而是受益非淺鮮的。</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（十四）鼻茸腫（俗名鼻菌）</p>
<p>鼻茸腫（Ｍaseupolyp又稱粘液鼻茸腫Schleimpolypo也就是一般人所說的鼻菌。他在鼻病常中要算很多而很重要的一個病。我們在臨診上。也是常常遇得着的。他並不是一種眞正的腫瘍。無非是一種慢性炎性産生物。他的發生。决不會單獨發生的。必定要有一種原因病做他的發源地。方才可以發生。最多的原因病。就是鼻膜炎和副鼻腔炎（像上顎寳炎和篩骨蜂窩炎）。本病生在成年的人最多。小兒生的很少。就是憑我十餘年的臨床經騐。也是未曾見過患鼻茸腫的小兒。鼻茸腫大半生在鼻腔的中甲介。或原發於副鼻腔。有時生在鼻咽腔。稱爲後鼻孔鼻茸腫Choaualpolyp。鼻茸腫往往具有細莖。或有廣大的基底。他的形態。在發生的起初。多半爲球形。日後如果增大的時候。那就可以變爲囊形，帶形，鷄冠形等狀。他的表面很滑澤。顔色呈灰白色。或呈灰白黄色。而帶一種玻璃樣的光澤。若用消息子試按他的硬度。則覺柔軟如膠。</p>
<p>本病主要的症候。就是鼻閉塞。鼻呼吸發生障礙。鼻腔的分泌物。著明增加。爲粘液樣。或爲膿樣。患者時常感覺頭痛和頭暈。經過如久。那就精神漸次不振。記憶力往往减退。患者有時苦於噴嚔。鼻内常常覺癢。這是鼻茸腫刺戟鼻腔粘膜的緣故。鼻茸腫是很容易出血的。所以醫師用探針診察的時候。或患者用手指探入鼻孔。觸及鼻茸腫的時候。屢屢可以引起鼻出血。</p>
<p>本病最良最妥的治療法。就是一定要由專科醫師。探索他的原因病。究竟是鼻膜炎呢。還是副鼻腔炎。如果原因病是副鼻膜炎。那就更有因果的關係。譬如副鼻腔炎久不醫治。他的天然開口處。不斷的流出膿汁粘膜受着膿汁的刺戟。這時候非常容易發生慢性炎性産生物。這種産生物就是鼻茸腫。一方面副鼻腔天然開口處，因被新生的鼻茸腫所阻而狹窄。天然的排膿機能。亦因此而告不良。副鼻腔炎也就更爲劇烈。在這種情形的時候。一方面應卽施行手術。用冷蹄係（鋼絲圈）將鼻茸腫摘出或絞斷。一方面應當根本治療副鼻腔炎。一旦治愈。卽無膿汁。粘膜旣無膿汁的刺戟。當然可免鼻茸腫的復發。一般人常言鼻茸腫。割了還要發。又何必要割。這都是割去後未將原因病治療的道理。讀了本篇的諸位。或可解釋這種疑寳啊。</p>

<p>— 黎錦熙</p>
<p>『大衆語』這個名詞，恕我淺陋得很，簡直不知道牠和『國語』或『白話』有甚麽異同！但是，話也没有這麽簡單，僅就字面解釋，牠和『國語』『白話』的確是不一樣：『國語』是對『外國語』說的，『白話』是對『文言』說的，『大衆語』是對『小衆語』說的——限於某一階級（如所謂『買辦式的白話』或職業用之類）或某一地方（如方言）的語言只好稱爲『小衆語』了，但『大衆語』也得限於某一時代（如宋元話本明淸白話小說之類，大都是根據當時的『大衆語』做的，但到現在却有許多不但不能談而且不能懂了；現在的『大衆語』也是與年俱進，與時爲變的），并且限於某一國家或某一民族（若打通國界的『大衆話』，那便是『世界話』，不在這個討論的範圍了），那麽，一國全民族大多數的人同時彼此都能聽得懂說得出的語言就呌做『大衆語』。『大衆語』的定義果然是這樣，那我仍舊不知道牠和『國語』或『白話』有甚麽異同了。</p>
<p>但是，話也仍舊没有那麽簡單，凡名詞都是各有來歷的，打開中國大辭典編纂處的材料抽屜一翻，『大衆』這個名詞却是古巳有三，一方面也是舶來品，可以當牠作名詞來用，或把牠當形容詞用，加於其他一切名詞上，於是乎『大衆語』就從中産出來了。恕我辭費！我此給大辭典先纂一通『大衆』的長編（長編原稿是王述達先生擬的，究竟太「長」，這裏只好來個節錄）：</p>
<p>（一）在上古的用法，『大衆』是農民被徵發而當兵作工的一大堆子人。證之於「經」：禮記月令？「孟春……母聚『大衆，毋置城郭』。（鄭注：「爲妨農之始」宋張伏月令解：「毋聚大衆，不集大師徒；毋城郭，不興大力役」）」「孟夏……毋起士功，毋發『大衆』。（鄭注：「爲妨蠶農之事。」）「仲冬……毋發室屋，及起『大衆』。」又證之「子」：吳子（戰國時的吳起）應變：「今有少卒，卒（猝）起擊金鳴鼓於阨路，雖有『大衆』，莫不驚動」（這是專指作戰時的大徒師了。）呂氏春秋季夏紀音律：「仲呂之月，無聚『大衆』，巡勸農事。」漢高誘注：「促呂，四月；『大衆』謂軍旅工役也，」這就是『大衆』一詞在古代的正式訓話了。再證之「史」：漢書匈奴傳：「單于之走，其兵往往與漢兵相亂，而隨單于，單于久不得與其『大衆』相得。」（這也是專指作戰時的軍旅了。」故上古通用『大衆』一詞，其意義就是「農兵和農工的大隊」，但都是被「在上者」徵發出來的。（以前所有字書，對此詞的古義都失考：惟翟灝通俗編卷八武功類有『大衆』一條，其中又引了管子一句，却錯了。）</p>
<p>（二）到了中古，用法遂變，『大衆』乃是聚在一塊兒的和尙尼姑以及居士女居士們，這却是義譯的印度「舶來品」了。原來梵語「僧伽」（Saingha），此譯『衆』，有和合之義（本來不過是文法的一個「集合名詞」，唐宋佛門却指出數目來，如法華玄讚依「衆」字舊義說爲「三人巳上」；天台觀經疏則謂「四人巳上，乃至百千無量」：法華義疏則加以限制，謂「四大已上，至萬二千人以還。」一個和尙不可和「僧」，猶云乎不可稱「衆」也，如寄歸傳三曰：「不可言僧某乙，僧是僧伽，目乎『大衆』，寗容一巳，輒道四人？西方無此法也。」但中土語習，難循西法，故又云：「分稱爲僧，理亦無爽。」現在北語常言，「七衆唪經」，但稱一個和尙也可呌「一衆兒」，最普通。）而大衆』則以譯梵語的「摩訶僧伽」（Ｍoha-Saingha），如法華經序品：「世尊在『大衆』，敷衍深法義。」（智度論曰：「大衆者，除佛餘一切賢聖。」本來以剃度的僧尼爲限，但及門之維摩詰便是「居士」，「天女」也成信徒，所以在這條『大衆』的定義上，擅把「居士，女居士」加入，諒必是通得過的。）</p>
<h3 id="c27">談二十五史兼答稜磨先生 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 夏丐尊</p>
<p>前幾天『自由談』刊載稜磨先生的一篇文字，題目呌做『從二十四史說起』，承蒙他提起了正在刊印中的『開明版二十五史』。他說我們的辦法把這部龐大的東西印成少少的九本，無形中增加人讀牠的勇氣；又說這部書的定價也算便便宜，其不圖重利也可贊美。我們看了這些語句，深深感激他讚許我們的好意。</p>
<p>此外，稜磨先生似乎不很贊成我們的整部翻印整部發售的計畫，他主張把全史分類改編，按類分售，以應付專門研究某一方面的人的需要；他發表了許多關於分類改編的可貴的意見，依我們想來，留心史學的人，對於他的意見一定會表示相當的同意。</p>
<p>分類改編的計畫，我們早也有了，和稜磨先生的意見可以說大略相同。現在不先實現這個計畫而先來翻印全史，有兩個原因。第一，我們以爲除了專門研究某一方面的人以外，自有需要把全史放在旁邊隨時參考的人；而各地的圖書館學校的圖書室是爲供應各個需要不同的人而設立的，尤其應該備有全史。第二，我們這個節縮版本特鑄鋅版印刷的辦法是帶一點嘗試意味的，如果承蒙大家讚許，書賣得出去，我們就繼續走這條路，再印旁的書；而全史的需要量似乎大一點，所以先來翻印全史，作爲嘗試。</p>
<p>我們的分類改編的計劃是这样的：把各我的「書」「志」「表」依類彙集，使牠各成一個系統。如果原書没有這些門類的，如三國志，我們就儘量採用後人補作的東西，如洪亮吉的補三國疆域志，洪飴孫的三國職官表，侯康姚振宗的補三國藝文志，吳增僅楊守敬的三國郡縣表，周嘉猷的三國紀年表，周明泰的三國志世系表等。卽使原有這些門類的名史，如果後人有精當的補正，如孫星衍的史記天官書補目和考證，章宗源姚振宗的隋書經籍志考證等，我們也儘量採入。我們不但要像稜磨先生所說，把外國傳四夷傳匈奴傳西域傳等編爲專册；我們更要把各史的儒林文苑等傳彙集起來，使牠成爲學術史和文學中的長編；那些雖然列在專傳裏的人物，而學術文章很有聲名的，如宋史裏的歐陽修和王安石等，我們也把他們的傳分别收入。這樣辦法，在稜磨先生看來，也許要說一聲「先得我心」吧。</p>
<p>末了說到廉價的問題。稜磨先生的意見，以爲如果照現在流行的通俗小說那樣排印裝訂，售價似乎還可以便宜。其實這是無法仿效的。通俗小說的銷售以十萬二十萬計算，匀攤開來，售價當然可以極度低廉。我們的二十五史决不會有那麽多的銷數。並且，我們要求字體淸楚，没有錯字，所以用照相鋅版印刷，用墨和裝訂也得相當地講究：成本加重，售價自然不能和通俗小說相比。這一層，想來稜磨先生也能諒解的。</p>

<p>春天下午四點鐘後，廣州披上一件柔軟而美麗的衣裳；橫在牠南首的高第路，像一條光亮迷人，繞着五彩飾品的頸項。在這上面，那一切着急地呼喊着招徠顧客的賣綢緞，賣鞋，和女人各種裝飾品的，裝璜華麗的店舖，是怎樣得意的誇傲着，給這虚僞的都會添加不少迷人的色調。</p>
<p>高第路東頭，靠左這邊有一家舖面很淺窄，規模並不很大的「履亨」鞋店。店舖裏，那臉孔和眼晴，嘴巴，鼻子都有着一致的圓形，並且流露出很精明的神氣的胖胖的老板，正在曲尺形的櫃臺前來回奔跑着，一面照料顧客，一面指揮那兩個一胖一瘦的年靑的伙伴。</p>
<p>四個穿着同樣整齊光潔的灰衣黑裙的女學生，正在對着一雙黄色細珠皮的高跟鞋，向老板瑣碎麻煩地指摘疵點的時候，突然走進一個三十多歲，中等身材，穿了一套殘破的軍服，左腋下夾住一隻木腿的兵士。他跨進了舖面，把木脚向身旁一扔，便縮小了自己似地坐在長條靠椅上。粗糙的右手向上揑揑那把濃密而藏滿汚垢的頭髮，閃着黄光的，深深地躱在濃眉下的那雙眼晴，釘着對面那些受了驚似地，張着嘴的女學生。</p>
<p>「阿標，問問那位客人可要買些什麽？」老板不大高興地吩咐　了一句，然後盡量利用他底圓滑的舌頭，把女顧客底不安輕輕洗去。</p>
<p>「樹膠底鞋呀。」那失掉了左腿的兵士回答了店夥，掉過頭來向馬路上望着那些多樣的，流動的人物。尖銳而複雜的汽車喇叭和人與人衝突或歡洽的聲音，構成了繁榮的囂鬧的境界。他在牛乳漿似地柔滑而迷人的空氣裏，自己彷彿從椅子上升騰起來了。他小心地用左手捉住那多餘的左腿的褲管，另外一隻手便愛撫地摸着右腮上，那叢黑毛刷似的鬍子中間那個刀疤，深恐怕都市底混濁的氛圍汚辱了他底過去的功績，他嘆了口氣，擰過臉來平仰着，平靜地像在收拾他底零碎的心情；回憶兩年前的冬天，在吳淞怎樣劇烈地跟日本兵搏鬥，而且因此就失掉了左腿的那一夜。</p>
<p>等到店夥遞一雙綠帆凡面的鞋子給他的時候，他才厭倦子似地拿起一隻鞋子仔細地審視着，並且最後，試套上了他那唯一的脚板上。</p>
<p>「幾多錢？」</p>
<p>「九角錢一雙。」那個瘦削的店伴無精打彩地回答，說完了，眼晴便又獃在那些快要講好價錢的女學生身上。</p>

<h3 id="c32">棉花攙雜標準的檢討 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— 朱仙舫</p>
<p>國産棉花攙水攙雜之足貶損品質，妨害紡織工程，須嚴加取締而免無謂損失，巳成無可不認之公論。政府有鑒及此，制定取締條例，明令公布。是固紡織工廠與技術團體夙昔之所求，袪除積弊，處罰不厭其嚴，亦固無可非議。惟第一條規定，本國棉以含水百分之十一爲法定標凖，則竊有所惑，不能無說。第八條原棉夾雜物以百分之○，五爲限，時論有置疑於此而請增益者，需爲說正之。</p>
<p>查歐美各國原棉含水之法定標凖爲八·五里長，合全重之百分率爲七·八三，因原棉經華氏二二○·—二三○·度之温度烘乾後，取之置於大氣中，仍能吸收水分百分之八·五，乃以之爲標凖，而爲法定水分含量之制定。大氣濕度，固因時地而異；原棉天然含水量。亦因濕度之異而顯有若干差異；則於制定標凖水分，自須依所在地之濕度而損益之。我國原棉法定標凖水分，能否同以世界法定標凖水分八·五里長爲率，與政府公布法定標凖百分之十一，是否較天然含量爲高，必以吾國全年平均濕度，是否較歐美全年平均濕度爲特高以爲斷。茲將歐美各地與大坂上海全年平均濕度，比較於後：</p>
<p>地名　平均濕度　地名　平均濕度</p>
<p>紐約　七四％　曼澈司特　八○％</p>
<p>舊金山　八六％　巴黎　七九％</p>
<p>孟買　七八％　　大坂　七四％</p>
<p>柏林　七六％　　上海　八○％</p>
<p>三十四年間平均見商務中國年鑑</p>
<p>歐美同以七·八三％爲原棉含水標凖，在歐美不以舊金山濕度特高，增其原棉含水標凖；避免標凖含量在天然含量之下，而貽棉農以損失。則在濕度與歐美略似之吾國，與歐美同以七·八三％爲法定標凖，亦固未爲不可。今不從同各國，定標凖水分爲百分之十一，較各國多三·一七％，即每百斤原棉，較應含水分多三·一七斤，留爲商販加潮餘地，而使紡廠在物質上蒙受三·一七斤損失。徵諸學理，自不得謂爲適如其量，確切允當，盡若紡織廠與技術團體所企求，袪除積弊至於其極也。顧或謂嚮之市場，悉以十二斤爲含水標凖，今不低减一斤乎？若驟然從同各國定爲七·八三斤，不將去現實過遠，窒礙難行乎？然習慣之說，非不可破除也。吾國事業不進，未嘗不以此爲暗礁。錢商利幣制不統一，而於換算時，可盡春剝取之能。棉商利廠商競購原棉，以潮棉進，其潮量有高至十二斤以上者：積久成習，一若十二斤爲市塲標凖水分。改兩爲元，行之稱便，則以合理的科學爲觀點，改訂原棉含水法定標凖爲七·八三斤，將吾國原棉，與各國原棉而齊一之，改正國際視聽，微論國内紡織工廠，免受不合理損失，而於原棉謀輸出，亦裨益孔多。今茲制定爲十一斤，旣尙有科學範圍之人加潮三·一七，推演所及，弊害滋多。暫行條例第二條「本國棉花在市塲買賣，以含水百分之十三爲最高限度。」第三條「本國棉花所含水分，超過最高限度者，絶對禁止買賣。」則每百斤原棉含水在十三斤以内者，市塲可允許買賣，僅扣除超過法定水分十一斤以外之水是棉可加水出賣，爲國家法令所許，將何杜絶惡習，而免貶損棉質，禁止妄冀非分者乎？况商販利潮棉混進，不爲購者察出，可得非分收益，幾何不在法所允許範圍内。充量加潮，而紡廠收進國棉，不將盡含十三斤水分乎？原棉含水達十三斤，擱存稍久，必起化學變化，强力色澤，均必大受影響。歷觀普通華棉，存至翌年四五月使用，色澤必較初購入時爲次；成品强力，亦較未經長時間擱置之所成者爲遜；含水過多而至霉爛，更無論矣。然同一處所棧儲之美印棉，雖擱置一二年，取之使用，色澤强力，均不變易，此易所含水分純乎天然，在八·五里艮以内，不若國棉有人工加潮，溢出天然含量之大較。而其妨害紡織工程，貶損成品品質，增加回絲回花生成，又爲從事斯業者夙所感受視爲無上痛苦者，今又不將驅之樂於使用外棉乎？國棉産量，現時固常不足應消費之需，擱存經年而至二年者，猶爲事實所無。若産量增加，至如美國必擱積多年而後陸續賣出，一仍含法定十一斤水分，則求不霉爛爲不堪使用之物而不能。蒙受損失者，又爲棉農與棉商。况加潮過量之棉，即在不霉爛前賣出，而春色質業巳低减，價格不能提高，在商販亦可視爲作繭自縛。更或謂原棉法定含水標凖低减至若各國同以七·八三％爲率，市塲價格，並不因多扣水分而提高，商販不將蒙受損失乎？然物價高低依供求盈虚而異，求過於供則價高。雖欲抑之而不能；供過於求則價低，雖有操縱者故抬其價，而亦難持久。凖是棉價高低，於法定標凖水分多寡何異。若必爲此說，是欲於棉價低落時，故攫多水，以水代棉，彌補損失；或於棉價高漲，時攙水於棉，减少棉之實質，而利减價競銷，此種以水凑合市價之所爲，决無存在可能。况棉商之棉，購自棉販，棉販之棉，購自棉農，由棉農而棉販棉商，均在法定標凖水分下，互爲買賣，絶無攙潮事實，尙何扣水之可言？更何因扣水而受損失之有乎？此對於取締攙水暫行條例，認爲法定水分，須改十一斤爲七·八三斤，且須於最短期間實行者也。</p>
<p>原棉夾雜，在吾國本爲絶無之事。蓋吾國於棉鈴開放，絮衣外綻時，棉農巡行壟畝，以手採摘，枯枝敗葉，絶無雜入機會。不若美爲大農，制作大地面種植，以機器採商，不易避免枝葉夾入。故吾國原棉，能較印美爲純潔。除人工加雜外，天然溷入者，唯飛颺下落之塵砂，爲量至微，軋籽棉爲淨棉；非軋機機構不良，决無整個棉籽隨絮而出，亦不致有破子溷雜絮間，故取締攙雜暫行條例第八條，夾雜物以百分之○·五爲限，在天然狀態下，决無達於此量之時。以此爲公許量，巳不免有人工加雜之虞，更何增益可能。論者不察，有以雜物超過百分之二，在市塲始禁止買賣爲請者，於學理事實，不知何所依據。此需辭以正之者也。政令初頒，用就管見所及，提與國人一商之。</p>
<h3 id="c33">從去年關册抄來的一篇帳 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 溪南</p>
<p>一國經濟的盈虚消息，做一國國民的應該知道。知道了，對於應奇的不奇，應戒的知戒。但是一國經濟情形，頭緖紛繁，那裏能使人人知道呢？所以要有一種簡單報告—如關册之類，給人去看，那就可以曉得一些大槪。可是關册還有以爲卷帙浩繁，看的人尙少。近來又正有人注意白銀出口，皇皇然謀抵制之策的確是一件要務。但是如果一看關册，白銀的出口，列在出超地位，今年將要第三年了！當先不怪，此刻才怪，不是晚了麽？好在我空閒無聊，就民國二十二年海關印行的貿易報告中關於貿易入超金銀進出的文表，權且充一下「滕（謄文公」，說句時髦話，效法孔老夫子的「述而不作」，摘錄在一起，以供閱報諸君的參考：</p>
<p>「…蓋吾人驟觀中國歷年入超甚鉅，且所資以抵補者，非銀莫屬，遂以爲提高銀價，即可减少中國有形之逆超。然詳爲推論，則知中國旣非産銀之國，故其彌補入超之現銀，必須先向國外購入，然後方可藉以挹注；是則中國所急需者，乃爲增加購銀之能力耳。由是足徵中國出口物價，必須先行提高，或與白銀價格同趨上游，方克有濟也。然則當此中國産銀消沉物價衰落之際，而謂先行提高銀價，即足以促進東方白銀之用途，其誰信之？誠恐影響所及，洋貨受其鼓勵，得以亟量輸入，而投機者流，復行現銀出口，藉牟厚利，以致國内存銀，或有源源外溢之患焉、</p>
<p>「比來中國進口現銀，因出口貿易衰落，奥夫土貨價格狂跌之故，爲數業巳寥寥。迨至本年（二十二年）則以供求原理之支配，巳由入超而變爲出超矣。…」</p>
<p>「本年現銀出入數量，就下列金銀進出表觀察，均屬極度萎縮。且出超之數，竟達一千四百四十萬元之鉅。查此項出超情形，在中國貿易史中，不乏先例，歐戰時期即係如是。該時參戰各國爲防戰事延長起見，對於現銀積極採購，以備應用。於是銀價高漲，出口數量，爲之激增。至於本年，則因美國放棄金本位，中國銀元對於美金，價值提高，投機者流，競相運銀入美，以牟厚利，因而出超之數大增。觀夫本年由美輸入現銀，僅值國幣二千九百四十萬元，而運往該國者，乃達七千一百萬元，則美元影響中國現銀外溢者，不言而喻矣。」</p>
<p>「溯自經濟恐慌勃發以來，中國進口生銀遞見减少；但爲國内經濟衰落反響，殆無疑義也。政府鑒於生銀外溢之可危，乃規定自本年（二十二年）四月六日起，所有出口之銀條銀塊銀錠及其他可供鑄幣之銀類，除中央造幣廠廠條外，均按從價徵收百分之二·二五出口稅，以資限制云。」</p>
<p>「中國禁金出口法令，自民國十九年五月實行以來，迄今未弛。本年經政府特准輸出之金，按照下表所載，較諸上年减少國幣三千九百九十萬元；而進口則與客歲無甚軒輊。惟私運出口者，當然不在少數：不但海關緝獲之數，可資左證，即就下列香港輸出數字之鉅，亦可見其一斑。查香港去歲正式進口生金，共值港幣一千九百五十萬元，出口者共值六千三百七十萬元。而本年進口者僅值六百萬元，出口者則達八千八百九十萬元。雖則由華輸港確數，無從查悉，但非微末，似可斷言也。茲將最近十年金銀進出數量及貿易差額列表於左，以資比較。」</p>

<p>從上面三種表，可以見到，（一）黄金早禁出口，即使輸出要經特准，然而牠要輸出，終要輸出，實在無法禁牠不輸出，（二）白銀早年不輸出，還有一種原因，即世界白銀無去路，不如存放在用銀的國家，中國爲便；如今白銀是有去路了，那裏不會搬出呢？（三）貿易不但最近十年來是入超，早先亦是入超，譬如我們開店，向人家進貨多，而我出貨少，結算下來，欠了人家錢，終究要拿現金去抵償的。所以中國前數年祇是黄金出超，（也可說黄金貴）如今黄金搬得可觀了；即使銀價不貴，也要搬出銀子，何况有人正在收買白銀呢？</p>
<p>不但入超應付的錢，要付給外國人；此外要付給外國人的正不知有多少；姑且舉幾種重要的列後，</p>
<p>（一）歷次戰敗乞和的賠欵本息</p>
<p>（二）歷次借的外債的應還本息</p>
<p>（三）投資工商實業的應得本利</p>
<p>（四）輪船的運費</p>
<p>（五）留學的經費</p>
<p>以上祇有我們支出，他们收入：彼此有往來的暫且不說，（欲明白這種情形，可參閱講匯兌的書）至於我們中國人所可得到外國人的錢，有那幾種，說來慚愧，而且惶恐，並且無幾：</p>
<p>（一）外國人的傳敎費（大半還是中國人出的錢）</p>
<p>（二）外國軍隊駐在中國的用費（他們吃的用的穿的還是他們自己的多）</p>
<p>（三）外國人用中國賺的錢，投資在中國的，此雖盤剥，幸而有此一筆，否則還要不堪設想）</p>
<p>這幾筆錢，在我們中國人實在不該去領受。而我們旣年年要付給外國人這麽許多錢，早應該不得了！其實現在何嘗「得了」，雀巢危幕罷了！不過我國人另有一筆大宗收入，足以稍彌對外支付的損失，就是華僑在海外以汗血換來的金錢。他身雖在外，心存祖國，逐年匯進來的實不在少數。可是去年的情形，也是大變特變了。且看關册記載的話，如下：</p>
<p>「厦門：貿易差額，向賴海外華僑匯欵，以資挹注。比歲以來，南洋各地，商務衰落，華僑經濟，困苦異常；返棹歸來，絡繹不絶。匯歸之欵，逐年减削，本年跌落尤鉅，按照本年估量之數計之，本年匯歸之欵，巳由去歲之國幣四千萬元，降爲三千萬元。……」</p>
<p>「汕頭……旅外僑民多賦歸來；以致年内匯歸之欵，大形减少。惟匯欵確數，因統計資料缺乏，無從查悉；但據估計，亦不過二千五百萬元而巳。」</p>
<p>「江門…南洋華僑，旣多失業，而墨西哥排斥華人運動，又甚激烈；以致華僑匯欵，較諸去年。復减三分之一，本埠龐大入超，無法抵補，商業資金，頗覺三澀。」</p>
<p>「瓊州…本年華僑匯歸之現欵及食米，共值國幣五百萬元，據云全年匯歸之欵，僅此而巳！」</p>
<p>「勝越…年來旅緬華工，失業者多，匯歸之欵，爲數銳减，市面盧比，不敷週轉，比價因之提高矣。」</p>
<p>有了上面這樣情形，那末，我們中國人所賴以抵付外國人的錢，更加微渺了。結果，所欠外國人的錢，仍舊要付，試問中國人旣不能用貨物去抵償，用何物去抵償？現在儘有一般人討論阻止白銀流出，若照關册上所載情形，那裏挽回入住？即使有辦法的話，也應知道一種方法，在他人行之有益，另一人行之，或見其害，即使有百利無一弊，也要看看環境是怎樣。不要自己没有得到益處，依然是「爲叢敺爵，」替他人造了機會去，到底累了自己人，那是何苦？</p>
<p>我不是講句迂話，除了脚踏實地去做去帮助那興業的工作之外，没有第二條出路，有則也祗是洽得一時之痛。所謂興業的工作，就是振興中國國産事業以求自給自足的工作。還要大家把「崇洋」心理，澈底改造一下，不要重視洋貨，輕棄國貨；應盡量採用國貨。國貨商人也不要專事製造外國材料加工的國貨，應趕緊籌畫改用本國材料，以副國貨的名實；一面努力設法從品質信用各方面嚴密地注意，促進對外輸出事業，那末，自然有辦法了。</p>
<p>目下祗有希望大衆銘心刻骨地「節用洋貨，多用土貨，」衆志可成城，或許可以稍資補救。</p>
<h3 id="c34">美國白銀國有的對策 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— 伯棣</p>
<p>美國收白銀爲國有，銀價爲什麽趨高呢？這因爲美國白銀國有命令民間於三個月内，將所有白銀（除出僅少的例外）繳納於造幣廠，造幣廠得扣除其六一·三二％爲鑄造益金，其殘額則以每盎斯金元五角零一毫之代價付與賣銀人。這每盎斯付與五角零一毫，適與現在的銀價相差不遠。但一九三四年購銀法案（TheSilverPurchaseActof1934）（白銀國有令是依據這個法金的。）規定收得銀一盎斯得發行銀票（SilvcrCertificate）一元二角九分。且銀國有令規定「該項銀票將維持十足銀凖備，……請求兌現時，以標凖美元兌換之，」這就是說，起先以每盎斯五角零一毫之代價收買下來的白銀，以後以之爲凖備發行鈔票時便值一元二角九分了。換言之，就是起先值五角零一毫的一盎斯銀，以後將不折不扣的值一元二角九分。這就是銀價的檯高一倍以上。</p>
<p>在這樣的風聲下，自然引起了投機，在中國方面自然誘致中外銀價水準的不平，而致白銀流出了。白銀流出的結果怎樣呢？</p>
<p>第一，現金凖備的空虚，中國發行鈔票，採着分散發行制，就是非但中央銀行可以發行鈔票，其他許多銀行亦發行着鈔票。這是與先進國採着集中發行制不同的一點。可是採集中發行制的先進國的發行凖備制，大抵是採四成現金凖備，六成保證凖備的制度的；而中國恰恰與之相反，便是六成現金凖備。四成保證凖備。所以白銀流出得過度，必影響到那六成的現金凖備。現金凖備旣然减少，那麽與之成正比例的鈔票數額亦必將减少，而造成通貨收縮（Ｄeflotion）的現象。斯時物價跌下，市面的不景氣將更甚。</p>
<p>第二，新銀本位幣的幻滅　中國的新銀幣的鑄造，照銀本位幣鑄造條例第十一條規定凡「銀類成色，爲千分之九九九者，每元納純銀二三·四九三四四八公分，加納鑄費一元之百分之二·二五。」這即是說新銀本位幣一元之名目價值，比那實質價值，高着百分之二·二五。這百分之二·二五。以造幣差益的名義爲政府之利得，所以每月造幣以四百萬計，政府的造幣收益，約有九萬元之譜。那麽民間爲什麽喜歡出百分之二·二五，將銀子納諸造幣廠去鑄新銀元呢？這因爲外國向中國實行白銀傾銷的緣故，中國的銀價，向比外國要高，所以民間與其將中國的銀，化了運費，保險費，打包費，等運到外國去販賣，不如納這百分之三。二五就近在國内鑄造銀圓之爲得。可是現在因美國抬高銀價的結果，使外國的銀價反而比中國高了，所以與其是出百分之二·二五來鑄銀圓，不如出運費保險費等販賣到外國去了。其結果非但新去鑄銀圓的日漸减少，連巳鑄成的銀元，恐將逐漸運出於外國；於是形成新銀元幣的幻滅，而政府每日少一批鑄幣收益，猶其餘事。</p>
<p>不管白銀政策在學理上並無多大的根據。（關於此點，愚在新中華二卷十七期，巳評論之。）但此種波及於中國的影響，則爲可能的事。然則我人應該有如何的對策呢？關於此點，時賢論之巳久，迄無盡善盡美之方案。愚於原則上贊成蔭溥先生的意見，以爲要使國内幣位安定，必需與外國銀行脫離關係，但於實行手續，「匯劃不能收現」的辦法。恐爲外商銀行所不許，故不得不另謀妥善之辦法。</p>
<p>照愚見，以爲銀之爲物，在世界雖爲商品，在中國則爲貨幣；但貨幣之爲物，有對内對外的兩作用，譬如在實行金本位的國家，金對國内是一種保證手段實際上並可流通，對外才是流通手段而爲國際貿易結賬之方法。可見銀在中國爲貨幣，更還維持着自由銀本位制的面目，它非但對外爲流通手段就是對内爲保證手段之外，同時亦爲流通手段。所以它旣可自由賣買，也可自由鑄造，更可自由兌現，自由較出入，在這樣的自由銀本位制之下，要使中　的貨幣與世界銀價脫離關係是不可能的。要使中國的貨幣價值與世界銀價脫離關係，必須停止中國的無限銀本位制而使之成爲「有限銀本位制」；這是最好的方法，便是使銀對國内單成爲保證手段，對國外成爲流通手段，換言之，便是對内停止兌現，對外則不禁銀出口；不過停止兌現，事實上往往等於禁銀出口，蓋停止兌現，便無從獲得出口之銀；這樣爲償還入超之貨價，其術將窮。爲救濟這一點，不妨令中央銀行到滙兌銀行（如中國銀行）爲生銀之賣買；不過民間欲向中央銀行購銀輸出以償貨貨時，須令其呈繳貨物輸入證書之類，以示限制。這樣一來，中國的白銀亦等於國有了。</p>
<p>不過爲實行此種國有政策之前，中國須改善發券制度，中國須得把分散發行制度改爲健全的集中發行制度，而且把六成的現金凖備制亦不妨改爲四成。蓋發行集中，即凖備集中，容易實行統制，而現金凖備的减低，更可節省白銀，而　白銀爲保證手段之作用。</p>
<p>如此辦法，即使銀價繼漲增高，我們中國自可少受其影響了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">American and Japanese Labor Unrest <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>America is the quintessential capitalist nation, possessing the most outstanding technology and organization, as well as the most abundant natural resources. As a result, it developed most rapidly during the World War. Its market expansion spread throughout the world, surpassing even Great Britain. Japan, considered a latecomer among the powers, possesses a technology and organization that is compact and efficient, though its natural resources are notably scarce. However, it benefited greatly from past wars, establishing a foundation for its dominance in East Asia. When the economic crisis of 1929 struck, America remained mired in this economic turmoil, with no clear solution. Japan, on the other hand, shifted its focus, diverting public attention through military expansion abroad and stimulating the domestic market with military procurement industries. Thus, on the surface, its economic situation appeared better than America's. However, in reality, there was not much difference.</p>
<p>The implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) in America has lasted for over a year. What have been its results? We need not offer much criticism, as the facts have already proven its limited effectiveness. Following the San Francisco dockworkers' strike, a textile workers' strike is brewing, with 720,000 participants, marking the largest such movement in American history. The main cause of the dispute is that both labor and management are dissatisfied with the NIRA. Labor demands the implementation of collective bargaining rights, shorter working hours, and increased wages. Capital, however, only recognizes individual factory unions and refuses to acknowledge a general union. Simultaneously, any reduction in working hours would entail wage cuts. Furthermore, in reality, there is a large surplus of cotton and woolen goods, and market sales are not thriving. If the strike is not too prolonged, it would actually benefit the capitalists, so many are happy to see the workers strike, using it as an opportunity to reduce production and raise market prices.</p>
<p>The remote cause of the Tokyo streetcar workers' strike is the loss of over 50 million yen due to the Great Earthquake, which has yet to be compensated. The immediate cause is the gradual development of other forms of transportation, leading to a decline in the number of streetcar users—in 1926, there were 450 million passengers annually, but in the past two or three years, this has fallen to around 300 million. As a result, the Tokyo streetcar system's debt exceeds 200 million yen. Consequently, the revenue of the Tokyo streetcar system cannot even cover the official interest on capital and the principal and interest on debts, leading to a spiral of debt and today's predicament. Therefore, the operation of the streetcar system must be reorganized. On the one hand, efforts are being made to increase revenue; on the other hand, staff are being cut. In reality, there are no effective methods to increase revenue. So-called improvements in service and attracting passengers are mere words with minimal fiscal impact. However, the reorganization of staff has a significant effect. Four hundred of the two thousand three hundred technicians and clerical staff are to be laid off, and all ten thousand eight hundred motormen, ticket sellers, technicians, signalmen, etc., will be dismissed and re-hired under new contracts. The streetcar bureau estimates that this item alone can save 3 million yen. Combined with savings in electricity and the reorganization of public bonds, it can indeed cover the current 8 million yen "deficit" budget. However, this has sparked strong resentment from the Tokyo Transportation Labor Union, with all streetcar workers striking in protest. It is estimated that the daily loss to the Tokyo streetcar system is at least 100,000 yen.</p>
<p>From the causes and nature of these two strikes, it is clear that they are not simply economic issues involving wage disputes. In the case of America, the primary issue is the labor unions' right to collective bargaining, followed by shorter working hours and increased wages. Since the implementation of the NIRA, while it has made a significant contribution to the overall American economy, its power is limited. It not only fails to resolve the economic crisis but also expands the scope of the problems. Since instigating the September 18th Incident, Japan has assumed that it is expanding its territory and firmly holding its hegemonic position in East Asia. The public's attention has shifted outward, and domestic crises can be covered up. Who would have known that the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy and that general industry has not shown much vitality? The fact that the Tokyo streetcar system went on strike due to its inability to remedy its losses is clear evidence of this.</p>
<p>Both America and Japan are trying their best to repair the current cracks and reconcile the disputes and conflicts between labor and management in an attempt to improve the status quo. Little do they know that the various contradictions in their own economies and politics are still expanding daily and cannot be overcome. Even if the labor unrest subsides, the difficult problems will still remain. To seek a solution will probably not be easy.</p>
<p>Education Control</p>
<p>and Talent Governance Plan</p>
<p>Ministry of Personnel proposes to the Examination Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Personnel intends to propose to the Examination Yuan to implement the Education Control and Talent Governance Plan. The measures are as follows: henceforth, the qualifications for civil service appointments, in addition to university graduation or previous civil service experience, shall not include revolutionary work by youth. Civil servants should undergo an annual examination every year and a general examination every three years. Those with poor performance should be eliminated. Higher Examinations should be held once every autumn, with the eliminated civil servants filling vacancies. Each public and private university must be required by the Ministry of Education to specify the number of students in each department according to social needs, and they must not over-enroll, leading to the risk of unemployment upon graduation.

<p>Shao Yuanchong and others return to Nanjing yesterday</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shao Yuanchong and Zhang Xianjun arrived in Nanjing at 10:30 AM on the 9th aboard the Jiangxin Wheel. They mentioned that during their recent inspection of Hunan and Hubei provinces, they had a generally positive impression. In recent years, Hunan has made great efforts in economic construction, with remarkable results. The authorities are striving forward amidst financial difficulties, a spirit that is commendable. The development of highway construction is faster than in any other province except Jiangxi, and the roadbeds are solid and the road surfaces are smooth. However, in terms of education, the general public seems to feel that there is no compromise due to the conflict between new and old ideas. In fact, Chinese and Western cultures are not irreconcilable. On the one hand, Western science and civilization should be adopted; on the other hand, our inherent culture should be reorganized and the national spirit should be promoted, so that the nation's future can complete its mission of revival. Hubei's politics are also on the right track, and various construction efforts are underway. However, both provinces have suffered heavier disasters this year. In addition to the local authorities striving to make proper arrangements, it is hoped that the central government can provide active relief. However, our country has suffered repeated natural disasters in recent years, and post-disaster relief is not only consumptive but also fails to achieve the purpose of relief. In the future, both the government and the people should strive to prevent disasters in order to reduce the occurrence of natural disasters and spare the people from living in suffering.

<p>Tragic Fire on American Mail Ship</p>
<p>Over Five Hundred Passengers Awaken from Dreams in Terror</p>
<p>Sixty Dead, Seventy-Three Missing</p>
<p>Sharks in the Sea Keep Company with Those Who Fall into the Water</p>
<p>(New York) The American ship "Morro Castle," weighing 11,600 tons, was en route from the capital of Cuba to New York when, in the early hours of today, it caught fire due to an electrical fault eight miles off the coast of New Jersey. The flames spread rapidly to the front and rear of the ship, prompting an urgent distress call via wireless telegraphy. Several ships received the signal and rushed to the scene to carry out a heroic rescue. According to a recent check, there were 558 passengers and crew members on board, of whom 425 were rescued. The death toll stands at 60, with 73 missing, far fewer than initially feared. When the fire broke out, most of the 318 passengers were asleep and unable to fully awaken, which is why many failed to escape. Furthermore, according to rescued crew members, many passengers were panicked by the flames and thick smoke and, despite the sailors' efforts to urge them into lifeboats, they were reluctant to leave the ship, resulting in their deaths. Miss Cabo de Villa, the daughter of the first Vice President of Cuba, was also among the passengers. Awakened by the shouting, she rushed out of her cabin only to be forced back by the flames. Fortunately, a sailor smashed a small window in her cabin, allowing her to crawl out through the opening. A fishing boat rescued one woman and seven men, but all died on the boat before they could reach land. The woman suddenly realized that the baby in her arms was dead and threw the child into the sea. Tragic events of this kind are too numerous to recount. Naval aircraft also assisted in the rescue, descending to pluck survivors from the water. According to crew members of one ship, they saw three sharks swimming among those struggling in the sea. Many of those rescued and brought here have been injured, but only with minor cuts and bruises. Some suffered nerve damage due to prolonged immersion in the water. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Asbury Park After the Morro Castle mail ship was destroyed by fire this morning, several ships are searching the coast of New Jersey in the hope of rescuing those who have not yet drowned. One hundred and eighty-three bodies have been recovered, and fifty are still missing, but there is little hope of finding any more survivors. The cause of the fire is believed to be an electrical fault caused by lightning. The total number of dead and missing is estimated at 230. Of the 558 people on board, 325 have now been accounted for. Bodies washed ashore all day, some burned beyond recognition, others drowned. Tax officers recovered 100 bodies. The British ship "Bermuda" rescued 72 people and brought them to New York. Some of them are in critical condition, while the rest are suffering from shock and cold and are in urgent need of medical attention. A small fishing boat rescued 70 injured passengers and recovered 10 bodies. The Morro Castle's lifeboat also brought 16 passengers and crew members ashore. The Customs Patrol boat "Danbury" rescued 15 crew members and towed the burned ship to New York. The Federal Steamboat Service has launched a detailed investigation into the incident. Some say the fire was not caused by an electrical fault. The ship was luxuriously equipped and operated between New York and Havana, Cuba, with a crew of 240 and 318 passengers at the time of the accident. The loss is estimated at US$3 million, all of which is insured. At the time of the accident, the ship was six miles off the coast of New Jersey when lightning struck, and within minutes the entire ship was engulfed in flames. At that time, the passengers were all asleep and had no time to wake up, resulting in chaos. According to the ship's deputy engineer, Mr. Pujo, the fire was so intense that the crew could not rescue the passengers, so they should not be blamed for dereliction of duty. Passengers, at a loss, jumped into the sea naked, but a few were able to swim six miles through the turbulent waves to reach the shore. (8th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Major Fire in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan</p>
<p>Losses of Three Million Yen</p>
<p>Kanazawa A fire broke out in Daishoji Town, Ishikawa Prefecture, at 2:56 AM on the 9th. The wind was strong at the time, and the fire spread rapidly throughout the city. Zhongmachi, Daishin-dō, Nakakido, Banyang-chō, Hon-chō, Shinyashiki, Daishōji Promenade, Gotoku-chō, Nishi-Kannon-chō, and other major streets were completely reduced to ashes. All important organizations, banks, and companies have been destroyed. The fire brigade was unable to extinguish the fire due to its intensity. The Daishoji Police Department requested the Ninth Division Headquarters to send troops to fight the fire. The headquarters immediately issued an urgent order, dispatching two squads of engineer troops from Kanazawa to Daishoji at 8:40 AM this morning. As of 9:00 AM this morning, the fire has not subsided. (9th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Kanazawa The major fire in Daishoji Town lasted for eight hours before being extinguished. The area is a center of the textile industry, with more than 50 factories. Today's fire destroyed more than 500 factories, government offices, companies, banks, and residential houses. 5,300 people are homeless, and the losses amount to 3 million yen.

<p>American Labor Unrest Intensifies</p>
<p>135,000 People Join Strike</p>
<p>(Washington) The textile workers' strike intensified today, with another 135,000 workers ordered to join. Gorman, vice president of the United Textile Workers of America, ordered carpet workers to join the strike on Monday and 85,000 hosiery workers to join at midnight on Wednesday. The order was issued in response to some factory owners' plans to hire replacement workers and resume operations on Monday with police protection. Gorman suggested that both sides temporarily cease hostilities and wait for the mediation committee to make a public judgment, but warned that a tragedy could occur if management forced the factories to reopen. Although riots have gradually decreased in various places today, it is expected that they will recur if the factories attempt to reopen. President Roosevelt's special mediation committee is now doing its best to find a solution. Today, the committee consulted with AFL President Green for several hours in an attempt to find a basis for a public judgment. Green said that all issues had been discussed, but no practical solution had been found. Green is preparing to hold a meeting with union leaders in Washington next week to discuss the steps to be taken by workers in various industries to assist the textile workers. All AFL members who are working will contribute US$5 each to enable the textile workers to sustain a long-term strike. (8th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The leaders of the hosiery industry union have decided that the number of people who will stop working due to the industry's strike will reach 85,000. At the same time, an independent union has also decided to strike, with about 4,000 members. Unorganized workers in the New England region will be affected. AFL President Green declared that he would contact the strike committee, but all unions affiliated with the AFL on Wednesday and Thursday have negotiated and decided on their attitude. It is generally believed that if the strike cannot be stopped, the unions will take serious decisions to maintain the strike. Gorman, chairman of the strike committee, has suggested to the mediation committee established by President Roosevelt that it should step in to arbitrate, but he has put forward three conditions: (1) employers and employees must be willing to accept the decision of the arbitration committee; (2) arbitration must be carried out by Monday at the latest; and (3) all spinning mills must be closed before the arbitration decision is made to prevent further killings. The employers have not yet responded to this matter. Gorman, chairman of the strike committee, stated in a published declaration that the strike is neither against the economic system nor against the government, but is a resistance to employers who are arrogant and disregard the intentions of the government.

<p>Japan's Diplomacy in Action Again</p>
<p>Ensuring Major Powers Understand Naval Policy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota is now working hard to ensure that all parties concerned understand Japan's disarmament policy. It has recently been decided that Ambassador Saito to the United States, Ambassador Sato to France, and Ambassador Sugimura to Italy will return to their posts in early October to carry out their activities. Among them, Ambassador Sugimura will detour through London on his way to Italy to meet with Ambassador Matsudaira to the United Kingdom to discuss important matters. It is reported that Ambassador Matsudaira will return to Japan after the London Preparatory Conference to discuss countermeasures for next year's conference with the authorities.</p>
<p>Okada Resolves Issue of Garrison Organs in Manchuria</p>
<p>Military Demands Clash</p>
<p>Minister of War Hayashi to Resign</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada received Lieutenant General Nanjō, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, at 1:00 PM on the 8th to hear the Kwantung Army's views on the issue of reforming the garrison organs in Manchuria. Prime Minister Okada intends to resolve the issue based on the following principles: (1) the military should be the center of the Manchurian administrative organs; (2) the military should also be the main body of the affiliated territories' administration. The demands of the Army authorities are: (1) general administrative matters of the Plenipotentiary Ambassador shall be supervised by the Prime Minister; (2) the first supervision of the Kwantung Army Governor shall be by the Plenipotentiary Ambassador and the second supervision shall be by the Prime Minister; (3) a Bureau of Manchurian Affairs shall be established with a military councillor as chairman; otherwise, no resolution will be recognized. Therefore, if Prime Minister Okada's resolution violates the principles of the Army, Minister of War Hayashi will resign. (9th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>

<p>French Foreign Minister Makes Contact for Two Days</p>
<p>Russia's Entry into the League of Nations Arrangement Completed</p>
<p>Two-Thirds Vote of the General Assembly Confirmed</p>
<p>Permanent Seat on the Executive Council Also Not a Problem</p>
<p>(Geneva) This evening, French Foreign Minister Barthou met with League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol and the Latvian Foreign Minister, and also consulted with Portuguese Foreign Minister de Mattos for a long time. De Mattos arrived here today from Paris with the Portuguese Chief Delegate to the League of Nations, Minister to France, Vasconcelos. As a result of French Foreign Minister's negotiations with representatives of various countries over the past two days, it seems that the legally required two-thirds majority in the General Assembly for the Soviet Union's entry into the League of Nations has been secured, and the number of votes obtained may be far above two-thirds. In addition, the granting of a permanent seat on the Executive Council to the Soviet Union requires unanimous approval by the Executive Council. At present, the countries on the Executive Council that have expressed opposition have voluntarily waived their right to vote. Therefore, unanimous approval within the Executive Council also seems to be not a problem. (8th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Polish Foreign Minister Beck held talks with British Representative Eden this afternoon. It is reported that Poland has requested France, Italy, and Britain to guarantee to automatically continue to elect Poland unanimously when the League of Nations Council is re-elected until Poland's non-permanent seat becomes a permanent seat. In this way, Poland may not oppose the Soviet Union's entry into the League of Nations. (8th Guomin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Warsaw The semi-official Iskra News Agency declared that direct negotiations are currently underway between the Polish and Soviet governments regarding the Soviet Union's entry into the League of Nations. After reporting the above news, the news agency added comments. Judging from these comments, although the Polish government's final attitude cannot be predicted in advance, it will not take a firm and unyielding stance. (8th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is now increasingly credible that Poland will not oppose the Soviet Union's entry into the League of Nations, and even will not oppose granting the Soviet Union a permanent seat on the Executive Council. Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, requested in this morning's non-public meeting of the Executive Council that the Soviet Union's entry into the League of Nations be postponed for discussion until Sunday. And when Beck met with French Foreign Minister Barthou after the Executive Council meeting, he also made some expressions. At least from these two things, it can be proved that Poland has a tendency not to oppose it. According to the latest news, the attitudes of Argentina and Portugal are also no longer as firm as before. In short, judging from the situation tonight, it is by no means a dangerous speculation to say that the Soviet Union's entry into the League of Nations can obtain the approval of a very large majority in the General Assembly. Perhaps when the General Assembly votes, only Switzerland will remain opposed to the Soviet Union's entry, and most of the other countries opposed to the Soviet Union's entry have been persuaded to waive their right to vote at that time. (8th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Warsaw At the time of the League of Nations meeting, Poland again felt uneasy. According to the semi-official Polska Daily News, the entire Polish nation, regardless of party affiliation, is now watching the development of the League of Nations, and is even more apprehensive about the League of Nations' handling of the situation because the situation in Eastern Europe is precarious. Although Poland has repeatedly signed treaties with neighboring countries, it has not been enough to guarantee peace, and the treaties signed by Poland with its neighboring countries have not affected its previous alliances. For example, the non-aggression treaty signed by Poland with Soviet Russia does not affect Poland's alliance with Romania, and the non-aggression treaty between Poland and Germany does not affect the Franco-Polish alliance. However, these treaties related to the overall situation in Eastern Europe are now being shaken by other plans, and the concrete results that have been obtained are also in danger of being lost. Therefore, Polish Foreign Minister Beck's struggle in Geneva is supported by the entire Polish nation, etc. (8th Guomin Telegram)</p>
<p>Warsaw Admiral Galletti, commander of the Soviet Union's Baltic Fleet, sailed into Gdynia Harbor on the 3rd of this month with warships, formally visiting Poland, and set sail and left today, escorted to territorial waters by two Polish destroyers. Admiral Galletti and fifteen senior officers came to Warsaw and were cordially received by the military authorities. The sailors of each warship also visited the Poznań area. The government sent newspapers to repeatedly write articles stating that the visit of the Soviet fleet made the general friendship between Russia and Poland and the relationship between the two countries' navies even closer.

<p>Opening of the League of Nations General Assembly</p>
<p>(Geneva) The 15th session of the International League of Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open tomorrow. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol will submit a report to the General Assembly. It has been learned that the report states that countries assuming mutual obligations, establishing mutual connections, publicly consulting, and abiding by customs are the entire system of the League of Nations. Once this system is destroyed, the entire world will inevitably be divided into several groups that are mutually hostile. If this is the case, the destruction of the entire world can be counted on the fingers. The report stated that since the last General Assembly, the League of Nations has undergone an important stage of crisis, but he has always had faith in the League of Nations, because although many of the hopes of the League of Nations' heyday have been delayed, the League of Nations is still urgently needed and indispensable for the modern world. Isn't this the reason why some large nations that have never joined the League of Nations now cooperate with the League of Nations more closely than before? The report continued to list the major issues to be resolved by the General Assembly. When describing the world economic situation, it stated that only international coordination can reverse the economic decline. This kind of international coordination can be carried out within the scope of a small number of groups at the beginning, and then gradually extended to the entire body. When describing the League of Nations system, it stated that the methods used by the League of Nations and its traditional practices are certainly not strict. It is certainly unnecessary to think that the League of Nations system is immutable, but it is also too early to change course immediately at present. (9th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Minister Simon and Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson have both arrived here. Henderson declared before leaving London that his trip was to inquire about the views of the various delegations on the current situation, and he had no intention of convening a meeting of the Disarmament Conference Presidium in the short term, because there are two important issues that should be resolved before the General Assembly: (1) the Soviet Union's entry into the League of Nations; (2) the Eastern European mutual assistance and non-aggression treaties. He does not believe that the Disarmament Conference can reconvene before the beginning of November. (9th Havas Telegram)</p>

The General Assembly expressed the hope that the results obtained could be noted at the 15th General Assembly. The Spanish government's letter reporting these results was discussed by the Executive Council (78th meeting) on January 18, 1934.

<p>By our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Recent Conditions in Longxi Counties and Hami in Xinjiang Province (Continued)</p>
<p>Rural Bankruptcy: The tragic state of rural bankruptcy is even more difficult to describe exhaustively. Fields and gardens are desolate, lacking the resources to cultivate. Even selecting from among the relatively better-off farmers and compensating them for cattle and manpower to plant white opium, only to have them petition for the government to pay their land taxes, there are still none willing to take up the offer. Some eat only thin millet porridge, twice or even once a day. Some don't even get this one or two meals of thin millet porridge. Some have daughters aged thirteen or fourteen with no pants to wear, willing to offer them as child brides for a "one gold piece per year" bride price. (Wherever the car went, villagers flocked to see it. Those older girls without pants either bent over and sidled away or sat on the ground to watch from afar, their situation truly pitiable.) Some farmers from County A travel far to County B to sell their labor, while young men from County B come to County A seeking "hardship," drifting about with no fixed abode. The poem "Thousands of villages and tens of thousands of households are like the Cold Food Festival, with no smoke or fire to be seen, only flowers" is truly a portrait of today's rural Longxi. Examining the reasons for this situation, though the causes are numerous, the arbitrary apportioning of "unjust levies" on farmers by local bullies is a major fatal blow to rural bankruptcy. These so-called "unjust levies" are different from "excessive and miscellaneous taxes," and their harm is even more insidious and profound. To give an example, here are the four "unjust levies" imposed on Wang Youde, a farmer in the fourth district of Linze County's Weidipu, for ease of understanding: First, "Following orders, each household is required to provide four oil lamps, along with clean oil, and a lamp lighter for one day." Second, "Following orders, each household is required to contribute to the establishment of the district party headquarters, including photography and temporary transportation costs, the cost of meals and lodging for Committee Member Zhou of the High Court, and subsidies for the district militia commander, totaling four yuan, with a notation of four jiao on the account." Third, "Following official notice, each household is required to pay six yuan for miscellaneous expenses, postage, telegrams, printing, transportation costs, and local meals for the fifth district." Fourth, "Following public discussion of the Fairy Maiden Society, a ten-day opera performance will be held, with each household contributing twelve thousand cash coins and five catties of dried noodles."</p>
<p>Three Wonders Beyond the Pass: The "wind" of Anxi is extremely fierce. During the Qing Dynasty, a convoy of silver carts carrying military provisions to Xinjiang was once blown away, people and animals together. The reporter also encountered strong winds several times, with sand and gravel striking the car windows, making a frightening "clang" sound. Moreover, the wind-blown shifting sand can turn plains into hills and hills into plains, without a doubt. The "heat" of Turpan allows one to bury chicken eggs in the sand or stick slices of meat on rocks, and they will be cooked in a short time and ready to eat. The "cold" of Baliqiao (Zhenxi) still brings snow flurries in May and June, and winter urine freezes on the ground into ice. These are called the Three Wonders Beyond the Pass. Popular custom removes the two wonders of cold and heat in Xinjiang and replaces them with the women of Yumen and the scriptures of Dunhuang, which seems inappropriate. Also, here, just after the Autumn Equinox, the weather suddenly turns cool, and the locals are already wearing padded jackets, a climate not found in the southeast.</p>
<p>Rich Mineral Resources: Longxi is extremely rich in mineral resources. Those that naturally emerge on the ground and are repeatedly mined and abandoned include the gold mines of the Qilian Mountains in Zhangye and the Eight Great Gullies of Dunhuang, the coal mines of Changma, Honggou, and Beiyao in Yumen County, and the southern mountains of Jiuquan, Zhangye, and Linze Counties, and the oil fields of Chijinpu and Baiyanghe Village in Yumen County. The copper of Yumen, the lead of Jiuquan, and the salt lakes of Dunhuang and Haja'erzui are all substantial in terms of production and quality. Among them, the oil, after chemical testing, contains 15 to 17 percent gasoline components, making it a particularly valuable resource in modern times. Unfortunately, residents are only allowed to scoop it up for personal use, and no large-scale exploitation is done, so the gasoline used for aviation and automobiles here is purchased from distant Tianjin and Shanghai, with the value soaring eight or nine times higher (the price of each case of gasoline in Shanghai is eight or nine yuan, while here it costs eighty yuan), and that only includes the transportation costs and the loss from evaporation, not even the waste from damage. As the saying goes, "Begging for food with a golden bowl," this is precisely what is happening here.</p>
<p>News from Hami: Although Anxi borders Xinjiang and is the throat of transportation between Xinjiang and Gansu, because of the looting by ignorant Kazakhs between Qitai and Hami, transportation is blocked, so news from Dihua is rarely heard. Reports are conflicting and opinions are divided. Recently, postal letters have been able to get through, but packages are still not being sent, and telegrams are often sent but not received. According to a recent letter from Liu Yinglin, the administrative chief of Hami, to his friend Mr. Xia here, mentioning the recent situation in Hami, it can be used as a reference for the situation in Xinjiang Province. Here are some excerpts: "Hami Town is the gateway to the eastern route of Xinjiang. It has only now returned to our territory after being abandoned last year (referring to Ma Zhongying's occupation). After such a great calamity, recovery is not easy. Moreover, the price of silver notes has plummeted (four hundred taels of silver notes can only be exchanged for one yuan in cash), and the prices of all goods have soared, making it extremely difficult to maintain a livelihood. Currently, each hundred catties of flour costs fourteen or fifteen thousand taels of silver notes. The salary I (Liu speaking about himself) receive each month is only enough to buy one hundred catties of flour. Generally, those who do small errands and those whose livelihoods are difficult are fleeing, the situation is miserable, even worse than the great famine in Gansu Province in the eighteenth year [of the Republic, 1929]." After signing his name at the end of the letter, he added, "A disturbance occurred here in Hami (it is said that Sheng Shicai, along with Commander Xu from Dihua, led 500 soldiers, intending to station them in Hami, serving as the county magistrate of Hami, which was opposed by Yao Lebos, the leader of the Turban Muslims. Administrative Chief Liu was also under surveillance, but Xu's troops did not enter Hami City and soon retreated), which almost led to a war. Fortunately, the situation turned dangerous into safe and has now been restored to peace." Furthermore, according to people coming from Hami, recently Dr. Yao Lebos has called himself the Commander of Punitive Forces, and it seems that he will take action against the Dihua side, so the situation in Xinjiang Province is presenting an image of "an approaching storm." The future does not allow for optimism, and the central government should have already planned remedial measures. (Anxi, August 23rd)</p>

<p>Replace Soybeans and Sorghum with Opium</p>
<p>Rehe Correspondence: The Rehe Economic Survey Group, organized by the pseudo-Fengtian Railway Bureau, has recently completed its survey of Rehe's economic situation and natural resources and has decided to develop Rehe in the shortest possible time. The Chaore Railway built by the Japanese is currently being rushed to completion and will expand Huludao's "intake and output" to create an inseparable relationship with Rehe, in order to collect the effectiveness of transporting goods, and will increase troops along the Great Wall to control North China and approach eastern Chahar. According to the report of the survey group, the Japanese have also decided to reform Rehe's agricultural products, prohibit the planting of sorghum and soybeans, and replace them with cotton, tobacco, and opium. The income from the opium monopoly system will be used for military expenses and construction costs. Rehe's import and export trade volume this year has already made significant progress. Here are the trade volumes of Rehe Province from January to June of this year (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Heavy Rain Causes Disaster in Luan County, Eastern Hebei</p>
<p>Water Four to Five Feet Deep in Tangshan and Luan County</p>
<p>People in Yutian Seek Refuge on High Ground</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since autumn, there has been much rain in northern Hebei. The weather is overcast every day, and the temperature is already like mid-autumn. The amount of autumn rain in various places exceeds that of previous years. Tangshan, Luan County, Fengrun, and Yutian Counties suffered heavy disasters on the 3rd of this month due to heavy rain and sudden rise in river water. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Tangshan County: From September 2nd, the clouds were dense and there was drizzling rain. At about 2:00 AM on the 3rd, the rain suddenly turned into a downpour. In less than an hour, the streets were two or three feet deep in water. The Shuikou River of the Mining Bureau was flooded and overflowed, and traffic on all the streets and alleys was completely cut off. The eastbound No. 101 passenger train was delayed for two hours due to water accumulation on the tracks. Stores in all the low-lying streets and shops were flooded, and the goods were soaked, causing heavy losses. Hundreds of houses were flooded and collapsed here. At the same time, the Douhe River flooded and overflowed, and many farmlands and villages were flooded. Furniture and sundries floating on the water were countless. On the 4th, it was still not clear, and the entire city of Tangshan was still immersed in the floodwaters.</p>
<p>Luan County: For nearly half a month, mountain torrents have erupted upstream, and the water level has risen, flooding many farmlands on both banks. Traffic on the Luan River and long-distance buses has been cut off. On the morning of the 3rd, heavy rain fell again, non-stop all day. The water level rose again, and three sections of the upstream embankment were washed away. The water was six or seven feet away from the Luan River Railway. Seventeen or eight boats were sunk, and the villages along the river were all submerged. The water was four or five feet deep in the farmlands along the coast. Villagers who were flooded all climbed onto roofs or trees to escape the rain, leaving their belongings to be washed away. Vehicles traveling to and from Beining Road passed through the Luan River Railway Bridge with great care.</p>
<p>Fengrun County: On the night of the 3rd, there was a heavy downpour, and the water inside the city was about three feet deep. The main roads connecting the county with various places were all flooded. More than a thousand shops and households were submerged in the water. The water on both sides of the Douhe River and the coal transport river was turbulent, and the riverbed widened four or five times or more. Xuanzhuang and Lanzhuang were completely submerged due to their low-lying terrain. The county government specially requisitioned civilian ships to form temporary rescue teams to carry out relief work and telegraphed the provincial government to allocate funds for emergency relief.</p>
<p>Yutian County: On the 3rd of this month, due to strong winds and heavy rain, three breaches occurred in the Huanxiang River and two breaches occurred in the Jiyun River. Residents of villages along the river all fled to the high ground of Hongqiao Town. Two to three thousand people were living in makeshift sheds on the high ground. However, the weather was already cold at night, and cooking was difficult, causing many people to suffer from seasonal epidemics. County Magistrate Chen Baosheng has telegraphed the provincial government to request the allocation of funds for emergency relief. Recently, the water in Yutian City was also two or three feet deep, and traffic was blocked. In addition, Zunhua, Funing, Changli, and Qian'an Counties also suffered from flooding, but not as severely as the four places recorded above. (4th)</p>
<p>The Bandit Xiao</p>
<p>Attacks Lingling but is Repelled</p>
<p>Remaining Bandits Find it Difficult to Return to Their Lair</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The various gangs of communist bandits Xiao Ke and Li Zongbao in southern Hunan recently attempted to break out of western Hunan and join forces with the bandit He Long on the Guizhou border. They were met and attacked by Hunan troops along multiple routes, and Guizhou troops were deployed to block them in Lingling. After the bandits were defeated and retreated, they avoided the strong and attacked the weak, mostly fleeing back to southern Hunan, Linwu and Lanshan. Recently, the bandit gangs have been unable to take advantage of gaps and are hesitating. On the night of the 31st of last month, bandits from Lanshan attempted to attack Yizhang, but were fiercely attacked by [unclear] troops. After about an hour of fighting, the bandits began to retreat to Xintian. At the moment, Hunan troops are advancing south step by step, so it is very difficult for the Xiao and Li bandits to break through. It is expected that the bandits will not dare to return to their old lair in the east. A telegram from the Hunan army yesterday reported the bandit situation as follows: "[Unclear] Secret: All of Xiao's bandits retreated successively to Yangming Mountain Huangbaijin on the night of the [27th]. Our [unclear] division followed up and attacked in places such as Fenshuiling, all with gains. Currently, they are confronting the bandits near Yong'anxu, which belongs to Xintian. According to Gui Xing, a surrendered puppet regiment commander, when the bandits' battle guards attacked, they used dense formations to pounce fiercely. If they were unsuccessful, they retreated. The bandits are very cunning. When the two armies are one or two days' journey apart, they only place unarmed soldiers and a small number of armed soldiers in their garrison to create a false appearance, while the main force, in plain clothes, takes advantage of the night to advance. Puppet party representatives hold great power. If three soldiers in the army are even heard speaking, they are brutally killed. A countermeasure seems to be to expand propaganda to undermine their morale and encourage them to reform. When fighting, adopt [unclear] formations, so that the bandits will have no way to use their cunning." It is specially heard that He Jian [unclear] (31st) printed (4th).</p>
<p>Anhui Province</p>
<p>Borrowed and Allocated Granary Grain for Famine Relief</p>
<p>Distributed to Severely Affected Counties for Price Stabilization</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Anhui Province suffered a rare drought this summer, affecting more than forty counties, accounting for more than two-thirds of the province. The disaster-stricken people are clamoring for relief, but large-scale relief funds are difficult to raise in a short time. It is necessary to select the more severely affected counties and plan relief in advance. The Provincial Government's People's Food Regulation Committee now considers the grain stored in the Wanyi Granary in the provincial capital to be purchased with treasury funds and originally intended for famine relief. In the autumn of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the provincial government originally resolved to allocate 80,000 yuan to the granary for grain purchase funds. Later, the Department of Finance only allocated 54,000 yuan due to the shortage of treasury funds. The granary currently has only 13,000 shi of grain in storage. Apart from the 4,000 shi that have already been selected and are being replaced by officials and gentry appointed by the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance, there are still 10,000 shi remaining. If all of it is allocated, it is feared that the provincial capital will lack food at times and will be unable to provide relief. For the sake of both, it is proposed to allocate 6,000 shi of grain from the granary, along with the 4,000 shi that have already been taken out for replacement, totaling 10,000 shi, and distribute it to the severely affected counties, ordering the county magistrates and sub-committees of the People's Food Regulation Committee to receive it and implement price stabilization or loan matters to provide relief. As for the amount of grain borrowed from the granary, the provincial treasury will allocate the same amount from the disaster relief reserve fund in the budget and purchase grain to fill the granary. This has already been signed and submitted to the provincial government for approval and instruction. It is expected that this measure of borrowing and allocating granary grain for price stabilization and famine relief will be approved. (September 7th)</p>
<p>The Bandits on the Anhui-Jiangxi Border</p>
<p>Are Gradually Collapsing</p>
<p>National Army Advances and Encircles</p>
<p>Major Destruction of the Bandit Nest in the Pseudo-Hexi County</p>
<p>Wuyuan Correspondence: The bandits entrenched in the Chengjiashan area on the Wuyuan-Qimen-Fuliang border area, although still resisting stubbornly and engaging in sporadic disturbances, are gradually collapsing due to insufficient internal strength and repeated setbacks, as the National Army continues to encircle and suppress them. At the moment, [unclear] regiments will join forces to suppress them within days. When the [unclear] regiment arrived at Xinghua Temple a few days ago, they killed a member of the pseudo-Hexi County Committee, a member of the district committee, and more than ten bandits, captured dozens of bandits, destroyed a pseudo-Hexi County Committee, a New Jiayuan arsenal, several clothing manufacturing plants, and a grain and fodder warehouse, with more than 30 dan of stored grain. According to the captured bandits, the bandits who fought with the [unclear] regiment this time were the pseudo-Vanguard Division, with more than a thousand people and seven or eight hundred guns. Another part was the pseudo-Guerrilla Force, with about seven or eight hundred people and more than four hundred guns. A few days ago, they had fled south from Wuguitou. The bandits who attacked Huangjian in Shexian County were also intercepted by the Beiding team there and retreated to the Hongguan Tuochuan Gaohu area in the ninth district of Wuyuan. Because the National Army was closely following them, they fled in disarray to Fuliang and southern Qimen. It is said that the bandits who harassed the sixth district attacked Jiadao Town (where the district office is located) the night before last, looted it, and then set fire to the Wanhe Cloth Shop and two umbrella shops before retreating along Yanqian Changxi Tianbaotang and other places.

<p>Construction of the Nanjing-Wuhu Railway Begins</p>
<p>—Traffic will open in January next year—</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Jiangnan Railway Company's construction of the Beijing-Zhao Railway, the first section from Wuhu to Xuancheng, has already opened to traffic, and passenger and freight transportation has begun. The second section, from Wuhu to Nanjing, has also officially started construction on August 25th after months of planning. The entire line is divided into four phases of construction: the first phase is from Wuhu to Daqiao Town in Dangtu County, the second phase is from Daqiao to Dangtu, the third phase is from Dangtu to Tongjing Town in Jiangning County, and the fourth phase is from Tongjing to Nanjing. The entire line is about one hundred kilometers long, employing 1,500 workers. It is planned to complete the earthwork and roadbed within two months. Eight hundred workers have already arrived in Wuhu, and the first phase of the project has already begun. The second, third, and fourth phases are also planned to start this month. The entire line is easier to construct than the first section from Wuhu to Xuancheng, as it mostly consists of flat land with no hills or high ground. The most substantial project is the Luqiao Bridge over the Dahe River in Dangtu. It is now planned to build a steel bridge, while iron bridges and wooden bridges will be built at other ditches and gaps. It has been decided that bridge construction and track laying will begin simultaneously after the earthwork and roadbed are completed. It is estimated that the entire section will be completed and open to traffic in January next year. The total cost of labor and materials is 5 million yuan. In addition, the thirty-li project at Sunjiabu, where the first section connects with the Xuanwu Line, is also being rushed to completion and can reach Sunjiabu directly from Wuhu within this month.

<p>Fengxian: Adoptive Father Conspires to Sell Dry Daughter into Prostitution</p>
<p>Qianzhuang Pinjuan, a woman from Nanqiao, was conspired to be sold into prostitution by her adoptive father, Zhuang Boru, in collusion with Ni Shilin. After the County Women's Association reported the matter and requested an investigation, the county government scheduled several trials and pronounced a verdict in court yesterday. The kidnappers, Ni Baolin and Zhuang Boru, and the brothel keepers, Gu Wu and Liu Shen, were sentenced to imprisonment, and taken into custody separately. Also, Xu Linsheng, a county government clerk, impersonated a bailiff and helped the brothel keeper Gu Wu force Ms. Zhuang to return to Shanghai, which was also found to be true. He has been dismissed, and the Public Security Bureau has been ordered to expel Xu from the country to maintain public morals.</p>
<p>Suzhou: The Discharge Problem of the Dahua Factory Causes a Great Disturbance</p>
<p>The Dahua Paperboard Factory in Huguan Town has a capital of 500,000 yuan and is quite large in scale. Recently, the factory's illegal construction has caused opposition from citizens, and the Construction Department has ordered it to stop work. Furthermore, the factory has dug a river in front of the factory to discharge grass residue, causing the river water to become turbid and contain toxic substances. Citizens have sent letters to the factory requesting it to stop this practice to maintain the citizens' drinking water supply, but the factory has repeatedly delayed and continued to discharge as usual. As a result, the citizens were greatly alarmed. On the 7th of this month, citizens such as Chen Jianchou and Wu Xinzhi gathered the public and held a meeting at the district office, demanding that the district chief find a way to provide relief, and put forward conditions demanding that the Dahua Factory first use water boats to transport water every day to supply the citizens' drinking water, and then dig another river. Before another river is dug, the factory must suspend work for seven days to avoid further discharge of polluted water. District Chief Chen contacted the factory manager Zhang Deming, and the factory accepted the water transport but could not agree to the suspension of work, so the citizens were dissatisfied. At about 4:00 PM on the 8th, several hundred citizens gathered with incense at the sports ground and invited District Chief Chen to go to the factory to petition. District Chief Chen entered to negotiate at that time, and the citizens waited outside the door. Because the factory firmly refused to agree, the public was extremely angry and wanted to break into the door, but was stopped by the police. Wang Fangchen, a guard at the door, was beaten and injured by the public. However, because there were so many people, they were still crowded into the factory gate, with great momentum, and threw the incense they were holding into a pile of straw, and a fire immediately started, burning more than 24,000 dan of straw to ashes. The public then withdrew, and all the shops in the town closed. After the police district in charge reported to the Public Security Bureau, Inspector Zhang personally went to the countryside to conduct an on-site investigation in order to handle the matter. Those injured in this incident include Zhang Zhengyuan, Xu Shunquan, Zhu Jinwen, Jiang Yuankai, Xu Aliuyu and five others. In addition to sending a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, the factory also telegraphed the Nanchang Headquarters and the Provincial Authorities, requesting a fair investigation and handling.</p>
<p>Theft and Kidnapping in Zhouzhuang Township</p>
<p>Lu Yikang, a farmer in Gaotianbang, Zhouzhuang Township, Suzhou, is relatively well-off. Bandits have coveted him for a long time. On the afternoon of the 8th, at about 1:00 PM, six bandits suddenly came, holding guns and pouring in, searching at will. They stole more than 200 yuan in silver and clothing. Before leaving, they kidnapped the owner, Lu Yikang, and left a note, demanding that the family prepare 5,000 yuan within three days for his ransom.</p>
<p>Promote Social Undertakings in Various Counties</p>
<p>Ma Yuanfang, the Director of Party Affairs in the First District of Jiangsu Province, convened a meeting of social education directors from various counties in Suzhou yesterday. Yao Qisu, Wang Chao-yi, Zhang Gengfu and seven others from Danyang, Zhenjiang, Kunshan, Wuxi, Wujin, Wujiang, and Wuxian Counties attended. The meeting was chaired by Ma Yuanfang, and the agenda included: (1) Determining the central work for each county in September; (2) The central work committee of each county should prepare a budget and submit it for approval; (3) Setting a deadline for submitting the status of social undertakings in each county; (4) This discussion meeting will be held once a month.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Autumn Cocoon Market Temporarily Suspends Opening</p>
<p>The Cocoon Industry Guild of this county held a general meeting of its members at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the opening date and cocoon prices for the autumn cocoon market, which is about to open. As a result, all members agreed that the Construction Department stipulated that each dan of dry cocoon in the autumn cocoon market would be charged six yuan for improvement fees. At a time when agriculture and commerce are in distress, our guild will never admit this and resolutely oppose it. We have previously submitted a request to the Construction Department of the Provincial Government for exemption, but we have not yet received an approval order. We should continue to telegraph the Provincial Department to urge approval. Before receiving the approval for exemption, there is no need to discuss the opening date and cocoon price for the cocoon market. After the discussion, the guild immediately sent a telegram to the Provincial Department, urging it to approve the exemption of the autumn cocoon improvement fee and quickly issue an approval.</p>
<p>Suicide by Taking Poison Due to Economic Pressure</p>
<p>Jiang Linshu, a resident of No. 58, Beilizhen, was engaged in the automobile business in Shanghai before, but has been unemployed for several years and has also become addicted to smoking, so he cannot make ends meet and is sitting idle. On the night of the day before yesterday (the 8th), he left his wife, Ms. Zhang, and went to the Dizang Temple on Xishan Mountain, where he secretly took poison. He died of poisoning at dawn. People called Ms. Zhang home to take care of the funeral. He left behind four or five children, which is quite pitiful.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Liyang Disaster Area Came to Wuxi to Beg for Relief</p>
<p>Liyang, a county located in the border area of Jiangsu Province to the west of this county, has been in a state of great loss of vitality since the great flood of the tenth year of the Republic (1921). Unexpectedly, this year it has suffered another severe drought, and the rivers, lakes, and dams have all dried up. The fields and crops in the whole county are withered. The business community is also unable to support itself and has closed down one after another. Disaster-stricken people have committed suicide due to lack of food and have fled to other places to beg for food. The fourth district of the county sent a representative to Wuxi to beg for relief. It is said that the local people in the county, seeing the severity of the disaster, are all extremely terrified. Therefore, they specially organized a Drought Relief Committee and appointed Shi Cantang and five others as representatives to beg for relief in the Wuxi-Suzhou-Shanghai area. Shi and others arrived in Wuxi yesterday and are scheduled to report the tragic drought conditions in the county to the party and government agencies, charitable organizations, and major philanthropists in this county this morning, and to beg for relief to benefit the dying disaster victims.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>The Provincial Anti-Smoking Association Sends Personnel to Secretly Investigate Soil Merchants</p>
<p>Pan Youzhi, an investigator of the Provincial Anti-Smoking Association, had previously come to Changzhou to investigate the internal work of the County Anti-Smoking Committee and the anti-smoking situation in the county. It is said that Pan has recently come to Changzhou again in secret to investigate the smuggling of soil and the application of soil paste shops in various urban and rural areas. On the afternoon of the 8th, Pan visited County Magistrate Hou at the county government to discuss the anti-smoking issue in detail. He left after about an hour. It is also heard that he left Changzhou that night for Wuxi.</p>
<p>Jiangyin: Conflict Between Police Officer and Merchants</p>
<p>Liu Shihui, the patrol officer of the third police station of Yangshe Public Security Bureau, previously led the police to arrest Wang Ludeng and four other merchants from this town for playing mahjong and sentenced them to a fine of 14 yuan each. The merchants of the town felt that it was unfair to be fined such a large sum for playing mahjong and were dissatisfied. Three days later, the matter had not been resolved. Later, Guo, a person from the town, mediated and settled the matter for a total fine of 13 yuan. Unexpectedly, a few days ago (the 6th), four patrol officers were playing mahjong in a rice mill and were caught by Yang Shunbao and others. The mahjong tiles and other gambling tools were all taken to the Public Security Bureau. Patrol Officer Liu refused to accept the case. The patrol officers in the bureau used long benches and other weapons to beat Yang Shunbao and others. Now the local people are greatly angered and have reported the details of the incident to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Jintan: The Disaster Situation is Extremely Severe and Relief is Urgently Needed</p>
<p>The disaster situation in Jiangsu Province is most severe in Jintan. After the severe drought, there was a pest infestation. Farming was abandoned and there was no way to salvage the situation. Local people have established a Drought Relief Association, and because the local economic capacity is limited, they have to beg for relief from philanthropists and charitable organizations across the country. Their public announcement said, "Since the flood of the twentieth year of the Republic [1931], Jintan has suffered from severe droughts in the twenty-first and twenty-second years, and has suffered from successive years of crop failure. Even if the harvest were bountiful, it would still be difficult to cope. Unexpectedly, there was little spring rain this year, and the bottom water was extremely shallow. In April and May, when it was time to transplant rice seedlings, there was no rain at all. Most of the highlands in the northeast, west, and south were not transplanted. The rivers near the water in the southern countryside were cut off and became barren land. In June and July, the drought was extremely severe. Even by the Autumn Equinox, the occasional light rain was of little help. The severity of the drought has not been seen in a century. Although the wheat harvest was considered moderate, the proceeds from the sale of wheat were used to purchase machinery to draw water in order to save the drought. However, when the machinery arrived, the rivers had already been cut off. The few cultivated fields that were planted were also withered. People changed to planting soybeans or buckwheat, but the heavens did not repent, and a pest infestation occurred, resembling crickets. The newly sprouted soybeans and buckwheat were also bitten off. The disaster area is vast and the days are long. The situation of holding food to feed others cannot be selected urgently. Public and private sectors are in distress and lack the ability to provide relief. We humbly request that philanthropists at home and abroad, the Chinese and foreign relief associations, the Shanghai Renji Charitable Hall, and various charitable organizations send personnel to conduct on-site inspections and provide relief. We are extremely eager to await orders."</p>
<p>Haimen: Qidong Residents Fear Food Shortages</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer in Qidong, there has been a long drought with no rain, crops have withered, and the autumn harvest has been sharply reduced. According to a definite investigation, the total harvest in the county is 85,527 shi, and the total consumption is 1,577,527 shi, with a shortage of 1,492,000 shi. The lack of food for the people is very serious and is a serious problem at present.</p>
<p>Nantong: Bandits Harass Rural Areas</p>
<p>Recently, bandits have been harassing the four rural areas of Tongyi on a large scale. A robbery and injury to police officers occurred in Liuqiao. On the 8th, the county government ordered the security team to strictly guard against and investigate bandits and ordered them to solve the bandit case in the area within a week.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: The Anti-Smoking Association is Ordered to Reorganize</p>
<p>The Anti-Smoking Committee of this county was recently ordered by the provincial capital to reorganize and tighten its expenditures.

As for the position of chief of the license section, it is still held by Chang Shizhi due to the heavy workload.</p>

<p>Ningbo: Rice Shop Owner Shot Dead by Bandits</p>
<p>Wang Chunfu, a resident of Dantang, more than ten li outside Ximen, Yongbu, opened the Yisheng Rice Shop. At about 8:00 PM the night before last, six or seven bandits suddenly came and robbed all the current silver of more than 240 yuan earned that day. Seeing this, Wang immediately escaped from the back door and shouted for thieves. He was seen by a thief guarding the back door, who shot Wang in the vital point, killing him immediately. Wu Wenqing, Wang's sister-in-law, heard the noise and came out to see, and was stabbed in the right leg by the thief with a knife. Zhang Wenhe, a partner, was also beaten and injured by the thief. The thieves, having achieved their purpose, all rushed out the door and fled along the road.</p>
<p>Fishing Boat Encounters Robbery and Crew are Kidnapped</p>
<p>Wang Xianfang, a resident of Liangheng Township, Second District, Dinghai, makes a living by fishing and owns a large seine boat with several crew members. Unexpectedly, while the boat was fishing in the ocean a few days ago, it suddenly encountered a robber ship that ordered it to stop. More than ten robbers, all armed with sophisticated firearms, boarded the ship and kidnapped the crew members Wang Wencai, Wang Xianpin, Wang Xianxin, Wang Chengshan, Dong Lixiang, and the helmsman Dong Xiaolian. When they arrived in Chuanshan, the robbers took Wang Wencai and the other five ashore and abandoned the ship. In the midst of the chaos, Wang Wencai seized the opportunity to escape and immediately returned to Dinghai to report to the shipowner. The whereabouts of the other five are still unknown.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan: The Disaster Situation in Nansha is Dire</p>
<p>The disaster situation in Nansha, Xiaoshan, Xiaosibu, Heshanwu and other places is dire this time. The crops withered, and at the point of dying, they were fortunately revived by several inches of timely rain. However, they were followed by a pest infestation that ate the stems and leaves of soybeans, sorghum, and cotton, resulting in an average autumn harvest of less than 30%. The disaster situation is dire and has not been seen in sixty years. Therefore, in the past two days, villagers from various villages have petitioned the county government to submit the matter to the provincial government for exemption from taxes in order to relieve the people's difficulties.</p>

In this memorial meeting, we should first understand its historical outline. We all know that the Premier was from Cuiheng Village in Xiangshan, Guangdong, but the Premier's ancestry originated in Jinling. His distant ancestor, Duke Yuanzhong, served as the Privy Council Envoy during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty. Because his opinions on Wang Anshi's Green Sprout Policy went against the Emperor's wishes, he was demoted to Jiangxi, where he resided until his death. His fifteenth-generation ancestor, Duke Changde, was the Yuan Dynasty Prefect of Hangzhou, moved to Zhuji Lane, and later became friends with He Zhen, Duke of Wanbo. Together with his sons Gui Rong, Gui Hua, Gui Shao, and Gui Wu, he moved to Yuantoushan in Dongguan, which was the beginning of their arrival in Guangdong. By the Ming Dynasty, his thirteenth-generation ancestor, Duke Lizan, moved to Xiangshan County. The Premier's father, Duke Dacheng, engaged in agriculture in his early years. At the age of thirty-two, he married after ten years and gave birth to Duke Dezhang. From then on, the eldest daughter, Jin Xing, the second son, De You, and the second daughter, Miao Xi, were born three years apart. The eldest daughter and the second son died young. The Premier was born in the Bingyin year, also three years after the second daughter. After another five years, the youngest daughter, Qiu Qi, was born. When the Premier was born, Duke Dacheng was fifty-four years old, and Madam Yang was thirty-nine years old. This also shows the practical importance of eugenics in advocating late marriage. Since the Premier was a farmer's son, he was extremely clear about the suffering of farmers. In his youth, he aspired to alleviate the suffering of farmers. Later, he graduated from the American Education School in Honolulu and then studied at schools such as Royal College of Hawaii University, Guangzhou Boji Hospital, and Hong Kong Alice Memorial Hospital. He also obtained a doctorate. Later, he established a pharmacy in Macau and Guangzhou, where he began his revolutionary work and became acquainted with Zheng Shiliang, Lu Haodong, and Wei Youqin, gradually adopting a radical approach. At the age of twenty-eight, he wrote a letter to Li Hongzhang, which was not adopted, leading to the organization of the revolutionary group Xingzhonghui to call on revolutionary patriots to work together. By the time of the first uprising, the revolutionary atmosphere had permeated the country. China's achievements today are greatly influenced by the first uprising. We are commemorating this event here, and we should trace back the revolutionary spirit of the past and make it a model for our current revolutionary construction.</p>
<p>Slogans of the Assembly</p>
<p>(1) Strictly abide by the Premier's teachings; (2) Strive for the work of resisting Japan; (3) Strive to eliminate the Red bandits; (4) Unite sincerely to resist foreign aggression; (5) Revitalize the countryside and develop the Northwest; (6) Strive for construction work; (7) Long live the Three Principles of the People; (8) Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party; (9) Long live the Republic of China.</p>

<p>The Second Batch of Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Arrived at 1 p.m. by the Tsukuba Maru</p>
<p>Our overseas Chinese compatriots in Japan have recently been unreasonably expelled by the Japanese. The first batch of fifty people returned home on the Japanese ship Kasado Maru on the 5th of this month. Thirty-one overseas Chinese who were forced to land in Moji returned home in two batches yesterday, arriving in Shanghai on the Japanese ship Tsukuba Maru and disembarking at Huishan Wharf at 1 p.m. Because the Public Safety Bureau had not received any notice beforehand, they did not send personnel to take care of the wharf. Only the first batch of expelled overseas Chinese went to welcome them. The details are attached below:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai at Noon Yesterday, Extremely Embarrassed</p>
<p>The Tsukuba Maru entered the port at 11:30 a.m. and docked at the old Broadway Wharf at 1 p.m. The first batch of expelled overseas Chinese all went to the wharf to welcome them. These overseas Chinese were haggard, disheveled, and mostly had scars on their faces. They were extremely embarrassed and had a full of grief and wanted to cry but had no tears. After landing, they still stayed at the Daxin Gongzhan Inn in the Sixteenth Ward.</p>
<p>Detained in Moji and Severely Abused</p>
<p>A reporter from the National News Agency met with overseas Chinese Mr. Xia Yongchang on the ship. According to him, those who returned home this time were originally on the same ship as the first batch, but unexpectedly, when the ship passed Moji, they were forced to land by the Japanese water police. The overseas Chinese believed that since they had been expelled, they would not allow themselves to be subjected to such insults again, which angered the Japanese, who did not hesitate to take coercive action, handcuffed our compatriots, and tied them with rough hemp ropes, and beat them with fists and feet. We were all angry but dared not speak. What was even more hateful was that the Japanese water police burned the backs of our hands with cigarette butts and used short knives to cut a deep gash on the forehead of overseas Chinese Wu Linhao, causing blood to flow all over the ground. The cruelty of the situation is difficult to describe.</p>
<p>Presented to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Requesting Relief</p>
<p>Submitted to the effect of being unreasonably expelled and property confiscated, hoping that the government will approve serious negotiations to recover the industry, and use the national system to sympathize with the people. We have been doing business in Niigata, Japan, for many years, some opening Kori stores, some opening noodle shops, and some working as laborers. We have been following the rules and regulations and doing business peacefully. In recent years, the Kuomintang Party affairs in our country have developed abroad and are starting to set up branches directly under the Sendai branch. The number of people joining the Party has been increasing, which has been discriminated against by the Japanese. On August 10, 23rd year of the Republic of China, the Japanese authorities suddenly sent people to insult more than 70 of us and drive us back to the country, and did not allow us to carry our wives and children and property. We asked again and again, but they ignored it and escorted us to the Yokohama Consulate for more than ten days. Our Consul General Wang Hongnian sent representatives to the Japan Mail Ship Company and contacted the Kasado Maru, and then bought group tickets on the 27th at 11 a.m. Captain Yokoyama was responsible for protecting us along the way. We landed in Shanghai. On September 1st, the ship arrived in Moji, and after entering the port, water police came to check the ship. They said that there were too many people and were not allowed to return home together. We discussed it with them, and they relied on violence to beat us and did not allow us to say a word. They also mobilized more than 100 ground police teams, gathered in the ship, tied us more than 80 people with hemp ropes, and scolded and beat us at the same time. Zhou Baozhen wanted to beg them a few words, but the police were like jackals and wolves, and they pushed Zhou into the sea. Fortunately, we tried our best to rescue him and saved his life. Wu Linhao was chased on the deck and was seriously injured by a gun butt. His waist was stabbed by a bayonet to a depth of about two inches. We saw that he was so fierce and did not dare to resist him, so we had to let him arrange it. They then ordered us to divide into two groups. The first group of 50 people took the Kasado Maru back to China first, and the second group was detained at the Moji police station to wait for another ship. The next day, they ordered us to send representatives Chen Fengqing and beat our fingerprints on white paper before releasing us 50 people to board the ship. The Kasado Maru arrived in Shanghai on the same day. We were bullied and abused along the way and suffered unspeakable hardships. The remaining 30 people are still being held in Moji, and their lives and deaths are uncertain. I think that our dignified China is now being arbitrarily trampled by the brutal Japanese slaves. Anyone with a little bit of blood boils when they hear it. The loss of money to us is a small matter, but the loss of national prestige is a big matter. For this reason, we implore you to provide assistance, send personnel to Beijing to petition, negotiate seriously, compensate for the loss, and recover all the property that we accumulated in Japan with our blood and sweat, so that we can find another way to live. The country will be fortunate, the overseas Chinese will be fortunate, and we will be grateful. In addition to sending letters to various organizations to request assistance, we have prepared a document to request you to implement it quickly, which is a virtue.</p>

Yesterday, they also received a telegram notifying Tan et al. that temporary relief funds of five yuan per person would be issued temporarily, and the funds would be remitted to Shanghai. As for whether to send them back to their original places or find other appropriate ways to provide relief, it is still unknown.</p>
<p>The Changfeng Warship Patrolled the Wusong Estuary</p>
<p>No Traces of Bandits Found</p>
<p>Recently, pirates have been harassing the waters of Chongming Haimen and Sand Island outside Wusong Estuary, hindering navigation. It is said that these bandits are remnants of Liu Guitang's troops. Wu Zhennan, Director of the Coastal Patrol, immediately ordered the Changfeng patrol ship to patrol.

To the Central Bank. In addition, an order was issued to the Shanghai Exchange Supervisor stating that the establishment of the exchange was originally to facilitate the trading of goods, but the Shanghai Gold Exchange has recently rarely settled in cash and mostly uses foreign exchange to settle prices, which not only violates the principle of gold trading but is also a place for speculators to create rumors and manipulate. In order to stabilize the market, this department urgently orders the supervisor to immediately order the exchange to use cash for all new transactions from the date of this order and not to use foreign exchange to settle prices, so as to match the name with the reality. The transactions made before may still be handled according to the original contract. The cash settlement shall also be supervised by the supervisor to organize a fineness appraisal committee to handle. In addition to informing the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, this order.</p>

<p>Sichuan Native Association</p>
<p>Telegraphed to Request Ways to Suppress the Exchange Rate</p>
<p>The Sichuan Native Association in Shanghai, due to the high exchange rate in Sichuan, has a great impact on the future of Sichuan merchants and students. They specially telegraphed Liu Xiang, the Sichuan authorities, to request that the exchange rate be maintained. The telegram said, urgent Chongqing Director Liu Pucheng Xunjian, members of our association in the business and academic circles have repeatedly stated that due to someone manipulating the exchange rate, the exchange rate from Chongqing to Shanghai has soared to 300 yuan per thousand yuan. Recently, there has been an upward trend. It is found that there are more outflows than inflows in Sichuan, and the export of cash is prohibited. The rise and fall of the exchange rate are normal, but if there is no manpower to manipulate it, it should not soar so much. Our association believes that this phenomenon is very harmful to Sichuan merchants and students outside the province. We specially telegraphed you, please use the consistent principle of Anchuan and benefiting the people, and the responsibility of leading the group, to take effective measures to stop the manipulation and suppress the exchange rate, so that merchants do not suspend business, and students do not stop chanting, then the hometown will be fortunate.

<p>Women's Domestic Goods Committee</p>
<p>Actively Promoting the Domestic Goods Movement</p>
<p>Exhibiting Trademarks Starting Tomorrow</p>
<p>Going to Rural Areas in the Country for Exhibition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Domestic Goods Year Movement Committee, in view of the failure of the movement to encourage women to use domestic goods in the first half of the year, has decided that this week, four executive committee members, including Lin Kecong and Li Manyun, will go to Chuansha, Nanhui, Songjiang, Baoshan, Jiading, Taicang and other counties near Songhu for a small-scale mobile exhibition. If people near Songhu can take the lead in using domestic goods, then other places can be used as a demonstration. The association also believes that trademarks are the marks of goods and the representatives of goods. Often inferior goods are disguised as domestic goods, and most of them are disguised by trademarks, so the fish and the eyes are mixed. Therefore, it has decided to display various domestic goods trademarks in various girls' schools in the city on the 11th, 12th and 13th of this month, so that women of the knowledge class can first recognize the domestic goods marks.</p>

The center held its 17th rural improvement meeting yesterday and discussed it. It was unanimously advocated that a petition be submitted to the county government to strictly prohibit it. The center has already prepared a document to petition County Magistrate Pan to issue a prohibition. The document says that there is a custom among the people to slaughter plough cattle for food after the White Dew Festival every year. It is believed that plough cattle are important livestock for farmers. They help with plowing in spring and summer and endure all kinds of hardships. When the agricultural gap arrives, they should be properly cared for to reward their previous labor and restore the health of the cattle. Even if funds are needed, they can be borrowed for application. It is inhumane to kill them suddenly, and the slaughter of plough cattle is prohibited by law. The central, provincial and county governments have repeatedly ordered and emphasized it, but ignorant people still cannot avoid disobeying the law. The center held its 17th rural improvement meeting on the 5th of this month, and unanimously advocated that a petition be submitted to the county government to issue a strict prohibition. For this reason, a document is prepared and submitted to you for your review and approval, and a strict prohibition is issued to rectify the people's hearts and maintain agricultural administration. Both public and private interests will be benefited.</p>

<p>Franco-Italian Accord</p>
<p>British Public Opinion Mixed</p>
<p>(London) Recently, newspapers have been widely reporting that an agreement will be established between France and Italy, causing public opinion to be unusually excited. Although the rumor that France and Italy have established an anti-German military agreement was denied by official circles in Paris, claiming that Franco-Italian negotiations have not yet produced concrete results, this is difficult to believe here. For example, The Times claimed that France and Italy had long been alarmed by Germany's rearmament and were considering ways to defend themselves. The newspaper also criticized Germany's abandonment of the League of Nations policy, but stated that the establishment of an understanding between France and Italy is also quite difficult, the biggest obstacle being the friendship between France and Yugoslavia. As for the Franco-Italian naval agreement, the newspaper felt even more doubtful. The Daily Telegraph's political correspondent, however, stated that an understanding had been reached between France and Italy regarding the naval presence of both countries off the coast of Libya and the colonization of Tunisians in Italy, which was welcome news in London. However, regarding the so-called military agreement, it was said that it should not be fully believed yet. The Rome correspondent for the Morning Post stated that the negotiations between France and Italy do not aim to encircle Germany and establish a military agreement. The newspaper expressed great welcome to the solid friendship between France and Italy. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>Germany Does Not Forget Its Colonies</p>
<p>Speech by Deputy Chancellor Hess</p>
<p>Nuremberg Today, German Führer Hess gave a speech at the National Socialist Party Congress to the National Socialist Party's foreign groups, saying that Germany needs colonies to obtain raw materials and promote export trade, but now is not the time to make this request.

He believes it to be so. Hess concluded by saying that carrying out an active propaganda movement to restore the old colonies today would easily be misinterpreted by Germany's enemies, who would use it to criticize.

<p>Mussolini Again Advocates the Yellow Peril Theory</p>
<p>Saying That European Countries Must Unite</p>
<p>To jointly resist Japan's monopoly of the Far East</p>
<p>A special telegram from the Osaka Asahi Shimbun in Rome on the 3rd of this month reported that Prime Minister Mussolini recently issued the Japanese Yellow Peril theory, saying that although Italy's territorial interests in the Far East are relatively light, from an economic point of view, the current situation in the Far East cannot be ignored. The shipment of Japanese goods in the Eastern market is quite amazing, and Italy's artificial silk exports have been overwhelmed, because today Italy, in the world the position of the second country of artificial silk will be won by Japan, and even silk, cotton and other Japanese goods, also invaded the Italian market, etc. Originally, Mr. Mussolini, although politically advocated the integration of Eastern and Western cultures, he is quite vigilant against the real problems, because he fears that Japan will monopolize hegemony in the Far East and develop the power of Japanese imperialism, so he loudly calls for the promotion of the Yellow Peril theory to warn European countries, hoping to unite the common front to confront Japan, and said that European countries in the Far East must not turn against each other, so that Japan can take advantage of it and reap the benefits of the fisherman, and should inform Japan of the limits that should be observed, and if Japan does not agree, then unite the European countries to confront it.</p>
<p>Germany's New Economic Policy</p>
<p>Earnestly Implement Agricultural Policies to Save Unemployed People</p>
<p>Equal Emphasis on Local Economy and Outward Development of Commerce</p>
<p>And Advocates Moving Urban People to Rural Areas to Increase Production</p>
<p>National News Agency German Correspondent, since the German National Socialist Party took power, it has not only been able to reform the political state, but also the economic state, and has also been vigorously reformed. According to the facts, the implementation of the reform of economic policies has been quite effective, so Germany's economic policy has a great relationship with the world, and the National Socialist Party is doing its best to study the methods of reform. If the economic position changes, Germany's international position will also be different, so it must be carefully considered. Today's unemployment problem, if all countries in the world can solve it, then the world's economic and political situation should gradually become prosperous, but it must be noted that the unemployment problem is caused by the current economic turnover and changes in economic organization. Since the war, whether in Germany or Britain, the export of its industrial products has not been able to restore the state before the war, and the export amount of industrial products before the war has often increased, but now it has not been increased in fact, so the unemployment problem has gradually expanded, so that when the economy directly changes during and after the war, each consumer country also sets up factories and starts manufacturing, so that the export products are not as good as before, the sales are decreasing, and the income is sharply reduced.</p>
<p>Because of these undisguisable facts, the National Socialist Party used it as a warning for economic planning. Now, the National Socialist Party is devoting itself to foreign trade and proceeding step by step to enrich the domestic economy in order to achieve its goals in the shortest possible time, so that the national economy will not be chaotic, and the Germans must be under the pressure of this helpless fact, to relieve the internal and external economic difficulties. In this way, the Germans cannot break away from the world economy, and it must be known that solving the domestic economic problems cannot be without any contact with the world, but must focus on the domestic economy. However, foreign trade should never be neglected. As for the trade relations with a certain country, it should be more or less, depending on the trade situation of each country.</p>
<p>The problem discussed here is how to solve Germany's internal economic problems, and its focus is on earnestly implementing the agricultural policy plan. The Germans now need to reorganize the local economy, and the outward-looking commercial policy should be earnestly implemented, so that they can obtain a large amount of benefits, so as to reduce the number of unemployed people, and in the future, wages will not be reduced, and the consolidation of wages will not be shaken. If this goal is to be achieved, everyone must have the idea of outward development, so that the unemployed can be re-employed, and they can work hard, and there are jobs everywhere. In this plan, we can enable a large number of unemployed people to be re-employed, so the purchasing power of the people can be improved.</p>
<p>Now, the Germans must first understand that this is not to reorganize the local economy, but to build big cities with one heart, but to go from big cities to small cities, in other words, to consolidate the importance of the economy according to the needs of the local area, but whether this can succeed can only be known afterwards. The National Socialist Party's economic plan varies from time to time and place to place, and it is actively responsible for implementing it. If this kind of plan can be realized, the world economy will inevitably be affected. The National Socialist Party always remembers and never forgets that it wants to reduce 150,000 unemployed people in the shortest possible time, which is the biggest undertaking, and by this, the purchasing power can be improved, so that Germany's internal economy will be prosperous day by day, and develop to infinity. But in this, there must be an overall comprehensive idea, and the National Socialist Party's plan also extends to other matters, that is, the reorganization of the economy is not purely within the scope of the economy, and in addition, attention is paid to political and cultural undertakings, so the National Socialist Party has not neglected economic and cultural undertakings. As for the eastern part of Germany, because the population is sparse, so that it has not been operated for a long time, there is a great danger in politics, so immigration should also be implemented. The more people from the cities move into the rural areas, the more natural products will be produced. This kind of undertaking is very big, and the national livelihood problem is even more important. The National Socialist Party's economic plan is to strive for step-by-step rationality and to be suitable for the principles of implementation, and it has unprecedented ability.</p>

It is planned to selectively grab Liujuan to defend it. Yanggeng Dam has not yet leaned on the current, and it is feared that the current will rise to the embankment.

The Hebei Provincial Treasury is empty, and I beg you to forward it to the Executive Yuan to find a way to provide assistance, etc. After Li Yizhi received the telegram, he has forwarded it to the Executive Yuan today to allocate funds for emergency relief.

<p>My Reading Experience</p>
<p>I am a child from a poor family, so naturally I could not enter any new schools. From a young age in my hometown, I managed to study for nine years, reciting the Three Character Classic and the Hundred Family Surnames, and recognizing a few characters. When I was sixteen, because my family was poor, I left my parents and came to Shanghai to work as an apprentice. During the three-year apprenticeship, I often had the opportunity to read newspapers and the popular romance novels of the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies School at that time. However, these books and newspapers were not of much benefit to me, because they were all about the love lives of young masters, or things like dark secrets. In addition, the words and allusions used in those books made me feel confused when I read them. Because I didn't have that kind of life, I couldn't understand the original meaning of the books and couldn't arouse my interest. Later, I felt that these books were not for apprentices like us, so I stopped reading them. Later, I started reading books on chemistry, physics, and other subjects related to my work. Although I didn't understand many terms, because these books were in line with the needs of my daily work, I felt a little interested and gained some benefit. The three years of apprenticeship quickly passed, and then I felt the problems of life and the problems of humanity. Under this mood, I began to read social science books. Unfortunately, there were not many social science books at that time, and even if there were, they were written in classical Chinese. Although I read them, I didn't feel interested or gain any benefit. This was naturally because I didn't understand classical Chinese. Later, I stopped reading books, but although I stopped on the surface, I was still passionately pursuing knowledge in my heart. Under this circumstance, after finishing work every day, when I went to sleep, I always thought slowly about the things I encountered and saw during the day, and I wanted to figure out a reason for them, otherwise I couldn't sleep. Sometimes I couldn't solve it myself, so I asked others and discussed it with them. In this way, I gradually felt interested, which was more practical than reading a book. For example, when I thought of the boss's abuse of apprentices, I always resented them for being inhuman in the past. Later, I saw in a deeper level that this was not a phenomenon in our store alone. It turned out that society was a part of people abusing another part of people. The boss was not humane or inhumane. All the crows in the world are equally black: if I were the boss, I would do the same. So I thought that this was not a problem of one person. However, the understanding at that time was more superficial than what I am saying now. Naturally, I still felt insufficient. I still wanted to find books to read when I had time. However, at this time, I already knew that reading books should be in line with our actual life and not waste time. So before I read books, I thought of the following questions: 1. What books should we read? 2. What books are in line with our actual life? 3. What books can help us live? The above three questions are my reading experience. I often ask myself these questions. In this way, I gradually understood that reading dead books is useless. Knowledge must be sought in actual life. The things that exist in society are all materials for our research. Books are just reference books for our research of these materials. Everything in the world has its reasons and conditions for existence. As long as we study it calmly, we can always find its cause and effect relationship. (Manuscript from Gao Er)</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A Voting Results</p>
<p>We are very grateful to our readers. All our suggestions can be answered by them, either by doing them or by raising objections. This has added a lot of help to the progress of our work. This time, we solicited readers' votes on "Reading Q&amp;A" because we just wanted to know the deficiencies in our work and at the same time wanted to know what readers actually wanted, so that our work would not verbally oppose people from being bookworms while actually instructing people to be bookworms and their actual lives are too far apart. Now, we will reveal a portion of the votes we have received as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Recently, the replies from this department have often been delayed for up to a month, which has caused many readers to express well-intentioned reproaches. This makes us feel very sorry! The replies from this department, except for those that are prepared to be published in the "Reading Q&amp;A," have always been for ordinary questions. Replies can be sent within a week. Requests for application forms, etc., can be sent within three days. More specialized questions that require consulting many books must also be answered within two weeks at the latest. However, for those questions that the colleagues in this department cannot answer, this department will send them to specially contracted experts, or temporarily find others to answer them. The time will inevitably be extended. This time, two letters were delayed for up to forty days because they were sent to a certain gentleman for an answer last month. The gentleman left Shanghai due to an event, and repeatedly entrusted others to forward them. In the end, the original letters were returned. This department found someone else to answer them, setting an unprecedented precedent. In the future, we will firmly adhere to our previous decision. The general principle for replying to letters is one week. For those that cannot be answered within one week, we will send a separate card to inform the reader, so as to avoid the reader's anxious anticipation. (2) If readers raise more than one question, they must also consider the nature of the questions, based on the principle of similarity. If you casually ask about everything from heaven to earth, it is difficult for us to answer. It would be convenient for everyone if you divide the miscellaneous questions into several times to ask. (3) All the procedures for participating in this department are detailed in the library catalog compilation of this library. Each catalog sells for seven cents in foreign currency. It is sold at the fee collection office of this library. For out-of-town inquiries, please attach seven cents in postage stamps to be mailed. (4) The publication date of Reading News has been changed. This column, Reading News, was originally published every Tuesday. Starting this week, it will be published every Monday. We hope readers will pay attention! The manuscript "Explaining Contradictions" has not yet been fully published. It will continue to be published on Tuesday.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Reducing Railway Freight Rates and Developing the Rural Economy (6) Wu Shaozeng <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>During last year's harvest season, the total amount of rice transported upstream on the entire Beijing-Shanghai line was only over 6,000 metric tons, accounting for a very small percentage of the total output. Moreover, most of these 6,000 metric tons were transported only within the scope of this railway. Only over 1,660 metric tons were transported to the north of the Yangtze River, which is less than 28% of the total. This is also sufficient to prove that long-distance transportation is not thriving.</p>
<p>(3) On the consumption side, a balance between supply and demand is a good sign for everything, especially for agricultural products that are related to people's livelihood. If the supply exceeds the demand at the consumption site of agricultural products, then the price will fall, which will make the farmers' hard work unrewarding. Conversely, if the demand exceeds the supply, then the price will be high. Farmers may profit from it, but other sectors will have a feeling of difficult life, which is not appropriate. However, China has long become the end of the world, and the self-sufficiency of various places in the country is insufficient, creating opportunities for foreign goods. Therefore, agricultural countries have the strange phenomenon of relying on foreign countries for agricultural products. According to the import statistics of rice, flour, and cotton in 1920, they are as follows:</p>
<p>Rice 19,921,1918 (shi) 121,244,766 (customs taels)</p>
<p>Flour 5,150,307 (dan) 31,556,388 (customs taels)</p>
<p>Cotton 3,474,889 (dan) 133,135,567 (customs taels)</p>
<p>The total import value of the three items is slightly less than 286 million customs taels. In addition, the value of imported foreign dried fruits, according to the statistics for December 1922, reached 330,000 gold yuan, which is more than 4 million gold yuan annually, which is more than 12 million national currency. What is its impact on our rural economy? Tracing the reason, it is nothing more than the excess supply in the main production areas and the excess demand in the main consumption areas. The reason for this imbalance between supply and demand is that traffic is blocked and freight is high. Otherwise, even if we sometimes rely on foreign countries, the quantity will definitely not be so huge. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>To sum up, for the sake of helping to develop the rural economy, the railway has a real need to thoroughly revise the freight rates for most agricultural products. It seems that the Ministry of Railways may as well designate several kinds of domestic agricultural products that are important to people's livelihood, economy, or national defense, and set a uniform and low freight rate that is beyond everything, leaving the transportation cost aside. That is,</p>
<p>According to the grades, respectively stipulate the freight rate per 100 kilometers per metric ton (whole vehicle) or per 50 kilograms (less than a whole vehicle), how much per 200 kilometers, how much per 300 kilometers, how much per 400 kilometers, how much per 500 kilometers, (less than 100 kilometers are all calculated according to 100 kilometers) (500 kilometers or more, regardless of distance, all are calculated according to 500 kilometers. Whether it is transportation on this railway or joint transportation on various railways, all are handled in accordance with this. As for the formulation of freight rates, the following steps can be taken:</p>
<p>(1) Investigate the inherent cost of each type of agricultural product, (2) Investigate the ordinary market price of each type of domestic agricultural product, (3) Investigate the selling price of imported foreign agricultural products of the same value, (4) Appropriately determine the minimum freight rate for each type of agricultural product per metric ton (whole vehicle) or per 50 kilograms (less than a whole vehicle) for transporting 100 kilometers, 200 kilometers, 300 kilometers, 400 kilometers, and 500 kilometers, so that the sum of the production cost and freight of each type of agricultural product does not exceed the ordinary market price of each city and can compete with imported foreign agricultural products of the same value. (5) Appropriately determine the percentage that should be increased for every 100 kilometers added between 100 kilometers and 500 kilometers (be sure to take a percentage that is easy to calculate).

<p>Slaughter Tax and Brokerage Tax Collection and Transfer in Shanghai and Nanjing</p>
<p>The Special Education Fund Case in Jiangsu Province is Fully Resolved</p>
<p>The slaughter tax and brokerage tax in Jiangsu Province's education funding, amounting to approximately 1.3 million yuan annually, account for slightly less than one-third of the province's education funding. Since the establishment of the special municipalities of Shanghai and Nanjing, the slaughter tax and brokerage tax collected in the municipal areas have been designated by the Jiangsu education sector as a special education fund and cannot be transferred, affecting the inherent education cause of the entire Jiangsu Province. The Ministry of Education has convened meetings of responsible representatives from the province and municipalities for discussions, and the Executive Yuan has decided that since the funds are designated for provincial education, these two types of tax revenue should still be managed by the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office. Subsequently, the province and municipalities negotiated back and forth. Nanjing agreed that the municipal government would collect and transfer an annual slaughter tax of 30,000 yuan and a brokerage tax of 14,000 yuan, and the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office has already resolved to follow this. Shanghai has agreed that the municipal government will collect and transfer an annual slaughter tax of 70,000 yuan, and this has also been resolved. However, for the brokerage tax, the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office and the Shanghai Municipal Government recently agreed on a contract in late August that the Shanghai Municipal Government will collect an annual sum of 42,000 yuan and transfer it on a monthly basis. The municipal government and the management office will each stamp and hold a copy of the agreed-upon method to ensure credibility. The long-standing dispute between the two municipalities of Shanghai and Nanjing and the Jiangsu provincial education authorities over the slaughter tax and brokerage tax case has now been fully resolved. The agreed-upon method between the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office is excerpted below: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Government will take over the collection and transfer of brokerage tax from Shanghai and Baoshan, which are incorporated into the municipal area, starting from July 1, 1934. (2) After the municipal government takes over this brokerage tax, it will allocate a regular tax amount of 42,000 yuan annually to the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office to maintain the special education fund. (3) This brokerage tax will be collected and transferred monthly by the municipal government according to the fixed amount, with 3,500 yuan allocated to the management office each month for receipt. (Several other articles, which ensure the method for this special education fund and the date of transfer of funds, are omitted.)</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education</p>
<p>Entrance Exam for Nautical and Marine Engineering Students</p>
<p>Physical Examination and Subject Tests Commence</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education previously received a dispatch from the Ministry of the Navy to continue recruiting 50 nautical and marine engineering students this year, recommended by various provinces, overseas Chinese, and military officers above the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Navy, with 10 students from each province. The exams were scheduled to be held at the Ministry of the Navy next month. The provincial selection method was previously announced and distributed by the Department of Education. It is now learned that the Department of Education conducted physical examinations in Zhenjiang yesterday, and examinations for various subjects will begin today.</p>

<p>Addendum</p>
<p>It is found that the column for students from the previous joint entrance exam in the 22nd academic year who did not finish the senior high school graduation joint entrance exam but passed all three subjects after the make-up exam and should be allowed to graduate was missing the name of Yin Mei-gu from McTyeire School, which should be added. Also, in the column for senior high school joint entrance exam students who failed three or more subjects, Shi Xue-wu from the Hujiang University Affiliated Middle School and Chen Jing-chao from the Qiaoguang Middle School were mistakenly reported by their schools to have missed their Biology and Mathematics grades, respectively. After the original schools submitted supplementary reports, they were approved for review and passed. The students should be listed in the column for students who failed one subject and should be corrected accordingly.</p>

<p>Advanced Singles Quarterfinals</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Wins Against Zheng Zhaojia After a Fierce Battle</p>
<p>A Five-Set Thriller Lasts Over Two Hours Before a Victor Emerges</p>
<p>Zheng Loses After Leading 5-1 in the Fifth Set</p>
<p>▲ China Loses to the United States in the Robber Cup Quarterfinals</p>
<p>Results of the advanced singles quarterfinals in lawn tennis: Karlson easily defeats Mada in straight sets; Qiu Feihai wins a five-set thriller against Zheng Zhaojia, lasting over two hours. Zheng had many opportunities to win but failed due to a lack of experience. Zheng led 5-1 in the first set but then lost six consecutive games, losing the set 5-7. In the fifth set, Zheng again led 5-1, and in the next game, with Qiu serving, Zheng was down 1-3 (15-40). Zheng only needed one more point to defeat Qiu Feihai. However, at this critical juncture, he failed to capitalize, losing point after point, and the score was tied 5-5. Qiu finally won the last set 9-7. In the Robber Cup China-U.S. match continuation, only five games were played, with the U.S. winning the fifth game 9-7. The U.S.-Portugal match was postponed due to darkness. The results of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>(Advanced Singles) Karlson (6-2, 6-0, 6-3) Mada</p>
<p>(Advanced Singles) Qiu Feihai (7-5, 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 9-7) Zheng Zhaojia</p>
<p>(Robber Cup Match) Karlson, Squia (6-4, 9-7, 8-10, 2-6, 9-7) Lin Baohua, Qiu Feihai</p>
<p>Robber Cup China-U.S. Match Continuation</p>
<p>In the Robber Cup quarterfinals, China and the United States each won two sets yesterday. The fifth set was stopped due to darkness when the score was 5-5. The match continued yesterday at the French Chamber of Commerce. Both sides were cautious and did not dare to act rashly. Qiu Feihai won a game with his serve, and his opponent Squia also won with his serve. Lin Baohua won again with his serve, and Karlson tied the score again, making it 7-7. In the next game, with Qiu serving, he won the first three points but ultimately failed, and the U.S. took the lead 8-7. Squia's serve game relied on three successful net interceptions by Shi, and China lost 7-9.</p>
<p>Karlson Defeats Mada</p>
<p>In the advanced singles quarterfinals, the outcome of Karlson versus Mada was expected. Karlson easily won in straight sets, losing only five games. Mada, who qualified for the quarterfinals due to Lin Baohua's withdrawal, performed mediocrely and had nothing to offer.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Narrowly Wins Against Little Zheng</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Escapes Death. Qiu Feihai versus Zheng Zhaojia was the third group to take the stage. The two players' skills were evenly matched, but Zheng lacked experience. He was either very good or very bad. His momentum was loose, his ball speed was slow, and his interest was very low. After the start, Zheng quickly took a 5-1 lead. Qiu followed closely, merely parrying without attacking, knowing Zheng's weaknesses and wanting to wait for him to self-destruct. Initially, Zheng was quite smooth, with very few self-destructions, so he was able to cruise along. However, later it was not like that. He repeatedly sent the ball into the net, allowing Qiu Feihai to win without effort, winning six consecutive games and reversing the lead to 7-5. In the second set, Qiu took a 3-1 lead, Zheng tied it at 3-3, 4-4, and finally Qiu still won 6-4.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia Strives and Achieves. In the third set, Zheng performed the best, and Qiu also stepped up his game, making the situation tense. After 2-2, Zheng used a heavy serve, immediately followed by a net rush, winning four consecutive points and making Qiu helpless. Zheng also gained an advantage in Qiu's serve game with the above net rush, making it 4-2, and Zheng took the upper hand. Qiu also retaliated fiercely, no longer waiting for Zheng to self-destruct like before. Before long, Qiu reversed the score to 5-4. Zheng refused to be outdone and won three consecutive games, taking back a set 7-5. After a break, Zheng won easily 6-3 in one go, and Qiu Feihai's face showed fatigue.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Receives an Unexpected Harvest. The fifth set was a matter of life and death. Zheng won the first two games, and Qiu won back one game. In Zheng's serve game, one person had an extremely beautiful diagonal shot, earning a lot of applause, which was the most exciting part. Zheng's momentum was strong, and he won three more games, taking a distant lead of 5-1. Qiu Feihai's spirit was dim, and he was at a loss. Zheng's final victory seemed to be in his grasp, and in the next game, with Qiu serving, he was already down 1-3. Zheng only needed to win one more point to resolve the victory or defeat. It was thought that Qiu would admit defeat. Who knew that Zheng would self-destruct again and again, sending even the easiest balls into the net, while Qiu was as steady as usual. Although he could not use fierce shots, he could at least return the ball over the net. Zheng repeated the mistakes of the first set and was beaten by Qiu to 5-5. Qiu served, and Zheng won four straight, thinking that Zheng could still win. In this set, the next game was Zheng's serve, but who knew he would also lose his serve, making it 6-6. Qiu then gained the advantage with a serve game, reversing to 7-6. Although Zheng made it 7-7, he ultimately failed 7-9. Alas, the sky was getting dark, and the Anglo-Portuguese Robber Cup doubles could not be held and was postponed.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Deling, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Ghosts Carry a Cartload of Guests from Guanzhong; A Family with Only Four Walls Crosses the River, Lamenting People from Qin</p>
<p>Secretary Chang said: "The common people can't find anything on the land. They can't just starve to death. Naturally, they have to exchange things for money to buy food. When it comes to exchanging for money, what else do the villagers have besides clothes and farm tools? City people don't want farm tools. The countryside can't grow land, and everyone is poor, so no one buys farm tools. As for clothes, people here can wear one piece of clothing for half a lifetime. Even if they sell them, there are no clothes to sell. So they only have two ways to exhaust their resources: one is to sell their livestock, and the other is to tear down windows, door panels, and roof beams, push them into the city in carts, and sell them. Tearing down roof beams to sell is the last resort for villagers. Once they sell them, they flee the famine. When one family leaves the village, another is torn down. Some people don't have time to tear them down and leave early. Later, some people will do it for them, so the village often becomes a strange phenomenon of only walls and no houses. Because of this, the people of Shaanxi have provided great proof of the ancient saying describing poor people as having nothing but the four walls of their homes. Truly, their homes only have four bare walls." Cheng Zhiqian said: "Is it really that bad? It's been six or seven years since the great drought of the eighteenth year. How hasn't it recovered yet?" Secretary Chang said: "How easy is it?" Saying that, he shook his head twice and said, "This can't be explained in a few words." Zhang Jiefu heard this and thought that it would be better to find a position in the provincial capital. The outer counties might be too difficult. Li Shilian also thought that the place was so poor that the common people definitely wouldn't eat meat, smoke, or drink wine casually. The slaughter tax and tobacco and alcohol tax probably wouldn't be very promising. When Cheng Zhiqian heard that the countryside was so poor, he paid extra attention to the situation along the way. Zhang and Li also had their own thoughts and feelings due to what they saw. Secretary Chang, who was accompanying them, didn't say much. While everyone was silent, the car passed through a village. In this village, there were also several families with only four walls. (15)</p>

<p>— (Echo)</p>
<p>It is common for women to apply powder and perfume to their faces and hair, and it is not surprising: this is a phenomenon that should exist for those who want to please. But the fact that the perfume from unknown sources is applied to the powder legs makes me feel that the world is indeed "getting worse every day," and the sense of smell of the men in the world is also becoming more and more degenerate!</p>
<h3 id="e14">Successful People in the City <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Holding Buddha</p>
<p>Everyone knows that diligence and thrift are the "road to success"; however, there are many roads to success in the city, not just the two roads of "diligence" and "thrift." Perhaps only knowing to take these two roads may not lead to success; there may be times of hitting a wall.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, there were three street urchins, A, B, and C, who lived a wandering life in S City, scavenging, picking up cigarette butts, and pulling oxen across the bridge, which were their only occupations. One day, they had no money to buy snacks to fill their stomachs, and their stomachs were growling like thunder. Urchin A calmly ran to a rice cake stall, wanting to borrow 120 coins for three rice cakes so that the three of them could share them. The owner of the rice cake stall glanced at him and saw that he was a street urchin, so he wouldn't lend him anything. Urchin A ran back dejectedly, discussing how to deal with the situation. Urchins B and C ran to the rice cake stall and started a fight on purpose. Urchin A took the opportunity to grab a handful of copper coins and ran away. Urchins B and C also scattered. This time, the problem of running out of food was finally solved.</p>
<p>One winter, these three urchins suddenly had good luck. In the snow, they saw an old man, reeking of alcohol, staggering into an alley. They saw that the old man was drunk and not very clear-headed; without hesitation, they swarmed up and carried out their specialty, the "pig-skinning" job. It was also their fate to have good luck. In addition to stripping off the squirrel fur coat and fox fur robe, they also grabbed more than 300 yuan in banknotes from the pocket. The three urchins were dazzled and couldn't close their eyes from laughing. The old man was still confused and thought someone was playing tug-of-war with him. After struggling for a while, he fell to the ground like a dead pig.</p>
<p>The three urchins, A, B, and C, had smooth sailing from then on. Each of them used the money they had plundered as a fund. In addition to doing some legitimate business, they still did some special business from time to time. Now, these three brothers all have family property, concubines, and cars. Their daily income is really not small.</p>
<p>"Everyone can do magic, but each has their own tricks." Isn't the success of the A, B, and C urchins taking a different path? Now, young people are shouting about "unemployment," "hunger," and "recession." It's really a sign of weakness if they don't know how to "strike while the iron is cold."</p>
<h3 id="e15">Ullambana Festival <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Biguang</p>
<p>This summer, the countryside, shrouded in superstition, has been lifting out the Dragon King to pray for rain and exposing the copper Guanyin to the hot sun. Drumming and gongs, they held god-welcoming events every day, and until now, they have forgotten even the season of falling autumn. The cracks in the rice fields are five or six inches wide, and the food waiting to be replanted, such as buckwheat and mung beans, cannot be planted. It is really frantic.</p>
<p>The general farmers, seeing that there is no hope for the autumn harvest, rumors are spreading like wildfire, such as zombies causing trouble, passing Yin soldiers, saying many superstitious words, not worth a smile from those who know!</p>
<p>Not having rice at home to cook is not a big deal, but the Ullambana Festival is a top priority. Every family sells their clothes to collect money, hire some monks to chant scriptures and recite Buddhist prayers, the sound is clear and melodious, the Sanskrit sounds match, and they also paste a lot of paper clothes, paper trousers, and paper utensils to burn, squandering useful money in the void. They believe that the Buddhist Dharma is boundless and can relieve all the suffering of the victims, relying on heaven to eat. But they are willing to chew on grass roots and bark, which is really ridiculously foolish.</p>
<p>The lunar seventh month is said to be a ghost season. In the past, there were also Buddhist events and burnings. But this year, even people have no money to spend and no rice to eat, but people are still very enthusiastic, holding Ullambana festivals every day - performing public offerings - isn't it a strange thing? Even the burning of paper money and tin foil is an even more considerable loss of money!</p>

<p>— Yao Zhongyin</p>
<p>The two characters "摩登" (módēng), or "modern," have been used in China for quite some time and are commonly understood as "fashionable"! Regarding "fashionable" as "modern," the more "modern" one becomes, the more harmful it is! However, according to the original French, "modern" is translated as "contemporary." If we take "contemporary" to be "modern," the more "modern" one becomes, the more beneficial it is! I cannot help but feel moved by this. I have often said that everything is good when it's in a foreign country, but it turns bad once it arrives in China! This is not just the case with the characters "摩登." Although Director Wang tries hard to correct it, the ingrained habit is too deep, and people continue to be unaware. It's difficult to see results without a thorough and fundamental reform. I will try to explore its origin, curb its flow, reveal its confusion, and point out its mistakes. When things reach an extreme, they will inevitably reverse, so perhaps there is still hope!</p>
<p>Examining the "Records of Mochou Lake," Volume Six, "Verifications of the Words of the Yujin Hall," the "Wanghai Tide" poem by Che Qiuling contains two lines: "Remaining fashionable and wondrous appearance, Zhou Fang could depict." The two characters "摩登" appear in the writings of a poet. When "摩登" is described as "wondrous appearance," it clearly refers to a woman. This poem was originally written about a young married woman of the Lu family by Mochou Lake. According to the "Records of Famous Paintings Through the Ages" and the "Xuanhe Painting Catalogue," "Zhou Fang, styled Jingxuan, was skilled at painting women, often in a plump and dignified manner." As the "Verifications of the Words of the Yujin Hall" was compiled by Ma Jucun during the Qing Jiaqing period, it is known that the term "摩登" has been used for a long time.</p>
<p>Also, examining the "Surangama Sutra": "Shakyamuni's cousin, Ananda, encountered the Matangi woman, was led into her chamber of debauchery, and was about to break his vows!" The name of Matangi was Prakriti, a prostitute! Even though Ananda was already a disciple of the Buddha, how could a disciple of the Buddha encounter a prostitute? Could it be that a prostitute is also an incarnation of the Buddha? Ananda means "joy." When the Joyful Buddha meets Matangi, could the Joyful Buddha in the Yonghe Temple be a transformation of this Buddha? Matangi was a prostitute, so why would people embrace this and insist on pursuing "摩登"? The Buddha's original intention was to universally save all beings. Is this also meant to serve as a warning? Buddhist texts also say that "men are called Matanga, and women are called Matangizhi. Prakriti is the Matangi woman. The Matangi woman and modern women are one and two, two and one." There is a reason for imitation.</p>
<p>"摩登" in China is like this, while "modern" in foreign countries is like that. China's pursuit of "摩登" leads to gradual degeneration, while foreign countries' pursuit of "modern" leads to gradual evolution. Different perspectives result in different behaviors, and the facts become vastly different. China lags behind foreign countries in everything. Even when it comes to "摩登," it is far behind foreign countries. Not only is it far behind, but it also goes against the grain. Perpetuating errors leads to further errors, and where will this lead us? To correct this error, we should use the term "contemporary" to rescue "fashionable." It is better to be a "contemporary woman" than a "fashionable woman." What contemporary women need are: education, profession, consistent career, and indispensability. Strive for a new lifestyle in clothing, food, housing, and transportation; promote domestic goods; advocate simplicity, love cleanliness, uphold thrift, and admire competence. Only then can we be worthy of being called a "contemporary woman"! Only then can we be worthy of being called a truly "modern" woman! Those who study "摩登" today must distinguish clearly between the old and the new!</p>

<p>— Yuan Chu</p>
<p>Life values affinity; those of different kinds cannot mingle. I knew you in the early days of Renzi, when your literary talent chased after pure joy. Although our unrestrained temperaments differed, we understood each other perfectly. In the midst of wine, our words were sincere, often engraved in our hearts. Shiqiao was filled with the setting sun, the name of the street where you lived.</p>
<p>The autumn wind at the edge of the sea is cold. I came to sit and have a deep conversation, hastily arranging cups and dishes. Our farewell was always hurried, the meaning never fully explained. Twenty years pass in the blink of an eye, and now you are in a coffin. I recognized the tracks at the door, still bearing the marks of the year before. Ascending to the hall and relying on the spirit altar, the sight fills me with sorrow. I awkwardly offer condolences to the young children, silently watching. Returning feels like a lifetime ago; who can dry these tears?</p>

<p>— Original work by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The two effects it had were: (1) to isolate it from the Tianjin train station, and (2) to prevent the Empress Dowager's jade feet from touching the soil trod upon by ordinary people. Needless to say, the person who came up with this plan must have been a very clever character! Dear readers, can you guess who this clever character was? Mentioning this person's great name, I don't think anyone wouldn't know him, right? This person was none other than Mr. Yuan Shikai of Xiangcheng, who will forever occupy a very important page in Chinese history! At that time, he was serving as the Governor-General of Zhili Province. Before the Empress Dowager set off south from Beijing, he had already decided to hold a grand welcoming ceremony and build a new platform.</p>
<p>The length of this platform was very long, although it could not accommodate the entire imperial train, it was enough for ten cars. On top of it, there was a bamboo shed covered with reed mats, and the shed was covered with countless dragon flags and other flags, as well as colorful ribbons, green pine and cypress trees, and various palace lanterns, which were decorated very beautifully and movingly. The ground was naturally covered with golden yellow sand. And on a square of land in the center, another apricot-yellow carpet was laid, which was prepared for the Empress Dowager to stand on after getting off the train. However, even though they were designing it like this, no one dared to determine whether the Empress Dowager would really be willing to get off the train when she arrived in Tianjin. Even a minister as powerful as Yuan Shikai did not dare to say, "The Empress Dowager must get off the train here."</p>
<p>The platform was newly built, the ground had yellow sand, and the top had a brightly lit reed shed. Naturally, it was very magnificent! From afar, we leaned out of the car window to look at it, and everyone found it very pleasing to the eye and couldn't help but compete to watch. And our train was gradually preparing to stop.

<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>To interpret it forcibly: "Wind injures the 'ying'" refers to various airborne infectious diseases of today. Wind itself cannot cause disease; the disease caused by wind is due to the impurities it carries. Song Yu's "Ode to Wind" states, "The wind of commoners rises from poor alleys, stirring dust and creating oppressive resentment. It assaults doors and windows, moving sand and ashes, frightening filth, and scattering rottenness. Insidiously entering through broken windows, it reaches dwellings. Therefore, the condition of those affected by this wind is confused, depressed, and distressed, causing warmth and dampness, with deep sadness in their hearts, generating illness and heat, with sores on their lips and shadows on their eyes." Yu Hangzhang believes that wind causes disease precisely by frightening filth and scattering rottenness, allowing pathogenic microorganisms to fly in the air and sow themselves in the human body. This can be said to reveal the hidden nature of wind. The one who speaks well of the ancients must have verifications in the present. Since there are pathogenic microorganisms in the air, flying objects enter the human body, either inhaled through the mouth and nose or attached to broken skin, then mixing into tissue cell fluid. It enters the blood through the lymphatic vessels to form various diseases, such as scarlet fever, measles, chickenpox, and influenza. In that case, the pathogens of airborne infectious diseases mostly enter the blood through the lymphatic medium. Considering this as "wind injures the 'wei'" is not impossible. However, when the disease occurs, it is because the pathogens multiply in the blood, producing toxins that lead to illness, which should no longer be considered a lymphatic disease. The symptoms vary depending on the individual characteristics of the disease contracted, and the treatment also varies depending on what the disease harms. How can one prescribe cinnamon twig decoction for "wind injures the 'wei'" as one of the three cardinal principles?</p>
<p>From the above, it is known that "cold injures the 'ying'" is not the "typhoid fever" in the "Taiyang" chapter of "Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases," and "wind injures the 'wei'" is not the "wind stroke" with cinnamon twig decoction. Therefore, the so-called "wind and cold both injure the 'ying' and 'wei'" in the third cardinal principle cannot be established at all. The absurdity is self-evident.</p>
<p>Some people in the past also knew that the theory of the three cardinal principles was wrong. Ke Yunbo did. He replaced the names "wind injures the 'wei' and cold injures the 'ying'" with "cinnamon twig decoction syndrome" and "ephedra decoction syndrome." This method is based on Sun Simiao's "Thousand Gold Wings" using the method of cinnamon twig decoction and the method of ephedra decoction, and Xu Lingtai's "Formulae Classified According to 'Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases'" develops and changes it to the extreme. Xu's preface to "Formulae Classified According to 'Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases'" says, "The 'Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases' did not exist as a complete book at the time; it was collected by Wang Shuhe. Although it is divided into six meridians, the language has no order. Yang meridians often have Yin meridian treatments, and Yin meridians often have Yang meridian treatments." It also says, "At that time, books were written by prescribing based on symptoms, with no fixed order." I think this is very true. The book by Zhang Zhongjing is a prescription case from that time. Treatment does not necessarily involve one person, and prescriptions are not fixed at one time. Prescriptions are based on symptoms and location. Even if they are not all from Zhang Zhongjing's hand, they are also, as mentioned in the preface, "widely collected from various prescriptions." These are prescription cases from the ancients. Treatment does not necessarily involve one person, and prescriptions are not fixed at one time. Prescriptions are also based on symptoms and location. Later scholars did not understand this meaning and reversed it, disordered it, changed the order, distinguished the true from the false, and strived to connect the top and bottom, linking them into one breath to develop a special system. This is the "Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases" of later generations, not the "Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases" of Zhang Zhongjing. To think that one can obtain the original face of Zhang Zhongjing's text is not too far-fetched. From Fang Zhonghang downwards, they are busy and tireless, truly what is called "a fool troubles himself."</p>
<p>In addition to the three cardinal principles in the "Taiyang" chapter, the most debated by various schools is the cinnamon twig decoction. Since ancient times, doctors have said that Zhang Zhongjing's method is to use cinnamon twig decoction for those with sweat and ephedra decoction for those without sweat. Moreover, because the "Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases" says, "Cinnamon twig is originally for resolving the muscles. If the person's pulse is floating and tense, has fever, and does not sweat, it should not be given." Therefore, it is said that the method of "sipping hot rice porridge and covering warmly to induce a slight sweat all over the body" with cinnamon twig decoction is the method of cinnamon twig for resolving the muscles, and that resolving the muscles is exclusively attributed to cinnamon twig. Xu Huixi, known as being able to read ancient books, also held this view. What else can the rest say? Shen Shi's "Ephedra Muscle Resolving Decoction" is found in "Waike Secret Records," Volume 1. Its four ingredients, dosage, decoction method, and administration method are all the same as Zhang Zhongjing's ephedra decoction, only the cinnamon twig is replaced with cinnamon heart. Moreover, there is a note at the end saying, "Based on Zhang Zhongjing's Ephedra Decoction." Also, "Waike Secret Records," Volume 3, contains "Elbow Reserve Ephedra Muscle Resolving Decoction," which has no cinnamon. It is commonly known by the ancients that ephedra resolves the muscles, so a separate record describes the uses of ephedra and includes the three characters "resolving the muscles." "Elbow Reserve" also has the name "Pueraria Lobata Branch Muscle Resolving Decoction." From this, it can be known that later generations' attribution of resolving the muscles exclusively to cinnamon twig, making empty arguments, is the saying of those with limited vision, sitting in a well and watching the sky.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(38) Ascariasis and Enterobiasis (Pinworm Infection)</p>
<p>(Question) In what part of the human body do these two types of worms reside?</p>
<p>(Answer) They both reside in the intestines.</p>
<p>(Question) What does an ascarid (roundworm) look like?</p>
<p>(Answer) An ascarid looks very much like an earthworm. The male worm is 20 cm long, and the female worm is 40 cm long, with a diameter of 5 hao, and a light red color.</p>
<p>(Question) How does an ascarid infect the human body?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is caused by swallowing worm eggs attached to unclean water or vegetables. After the worm eggs enter the intestine, they hatch into larvae, which pass through the intestinal wall into the portal vein of the liver, reach the lungs, and then pass through the trachea into the esophagus and reach the small intestine, where they reside.</p>
<p>(Question) What do ascarid eggs look like?</p>
<p>(Answer) They are oval in shape, yellowish in color, with a two-layered eggshell with a rough and raised shell surface and particles inside.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms after an ascarid infestation?</p>
<p>(Answer) Sometimes there are no symptoms. Sometimes there is occult blood in the stool, or complaints of stomach pain on an empty stomach. Sometimes patients have symptoms of anemia or intestinal inflammation. When a large number of worms accumulate, the stool becomes constipated and the intestinal tract becomes blocked. Sometimes they invade the bile duct and cause jaundice, or form a liver abscess.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the treatment for ascariasis?</p>
<p>(Answer) Take santonin orally. The adult dose is 0.1-0.3 grams per day, for three consecutive days, and then take a laxative to expel them. The children's dose is 0.02-0.04 grams. In addition, sea wormwood can be used, 10-30 grams per day, decocted and taken orally for two or three consecutive days.</p>
<p>(Question) What do pinworms and their eggs look like?</p>
<p>(Answer) Pinworms are small, thread-like worms. The male worm is 4 hao long, and the female worm is 10 to 12 hao long. The eggs are bean-shaped, with a long diameter of 0.05 hao and a width of 0.02 hao.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the route of infection?</p>
<p>(Answer) After the worm eggs reach the stomach, they quickly develop and produce larvae, which gather in the small intestine and cecum. At maturity, they gradually migrate to the rectum. When the eggs mature, the female worms exit the anus and lay eggs near the anus.</p>
<p>(Question) What symptoms occur in people with enterobiasis (pinworm infection)?</p>
<p>(Answer) People infected with pinworms experience itching in the anal area, especially at night. Women experience itching in the vaginal area, or neurological symptoms caused by insomnia at night.</p>
<p>(Question) Why is enterobiasis difficult to cure completely?</p>
<p>(Answer) Because the worm eggs near the anus are scratched with fingers, and then transmitted to the mouth by the fingers, causing a second self-infection. This repeats endlessly, so it seems difficult to cure completely.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the method of prevention?</p>
<p>(Answer) To prevent self-infection, prohibit eating with your hands. Wear gloves or tie your hands at night.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the treatment for enterobiasis?</p>
<p>(Answer) First, apply gray-white ointment (i.e., mercury ointment) around the anus. Wash the intestines every week with 10% vinegar, or 100 to 300 times diluted quinine hydrochloride solution, 1000 times diluted tannic acid solution, or 200 times diluted salicylic acid solution. Take anthelmintics such as piperazine and santonin orally. It is advisable to take a laxative the night before taking the medicine to empty the intestines, which is more effective.</p>
<h3 id="e22">How to Remove Dust and Sand That Flies Into Your Eyes <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Wu Zhili</p>
<p>It often happens that dust or other foreign objects fly into our eyes, which is very troublesome. The pain can only stop after you think of removing it. The pain suffered and the large amount of tears shed can cause insomnia all night. If we do not find a way to remove it, inflammation will occur and even more troublesome eye problems will arise.</p>
<p>When coal ash enters the eye, do not close your eyes. Although it is difficult not to close your eyes, because closing your eyes is a quick reaction to protect your eyes, this closing of the eyes is very rapid and forceful, which will push the dust and sand deeper. So we have to close our eyes, or use our hands (clean hands, separate the upper and lower eyelids, and let the natural tears come out. At that time, the dust and sand may float out of the eye, or it can be dissolved in the acidity of the tears. After about a minute, then gently close your eyes. If you still feel something in your eye, you should straighten your head. Look down, pull the upper eyelid down, and pull it to the outside of the lower eyelid. In this position, you must automatically turn your eyeball upwards, and then let go, allowing the upper eyelid to return to its original position. Why do you do this? Because if the dust and sand are under the upper eyelid (the most common situation), the edge of the lower eyelid can grind and scrape out the dust and sand when the upper eyelid returns. If it doesn't work, you can try it several times.</p>
<p>If the method mentioned above does not work, we can know that this uninvited guest has probably run into the very thin cornea in front of the pupil. Once it gets to this place, you cannot move it yourself. All we should do is go to a doctor. Don't be cheap and go to a pharmacist or barber to relieve your troubles, because your eyes are too valuable. If you have a beautiful car, you will definitely not drive to the grocery market to show off, but instead you will get your car dirty. So you must not allow ignorant and inexperienced people to solve your pain.</p>
<p>Not only can coal ash be treated with the above methods, but also common ingrown eyelashes and iron filings entering the eyes, etc., can be cured in the same way. Many workers in foundry shops often do not take care or do not wear dust-proof glasses, so hot iron filings will come to their eyes. Although it hurts for a while, it doesn't hurt anymore, because the heat of the iron filings has burned the nerve endings on the cornea, but after a few hours, the severe pain will start again, and the tears will flow incessantly. This is because the nerve cells are regenerating, and therefore their transmission function is restored. In these shops, there is often a coworker who is confident that he can cure this eye disease. What does he do? He always carries a sharp small folding knife with him, specially for this purpose. He takes his treasured knife from his dirty bag with his muddy hands, and then tells the victim to open his eyes and not close them, until he has taken out the iron filings. Ordinary people's eyes cannot always be open and will always close, because the cornea is the thinnest and the most sensitive to stimuli. So when the tip of the knife touches her, the eyes will close in response. If this coworker and the victim are lucky, it will be taken out all at once, but usually it takes several times. After several times, the cornea will rupture. Once it ruptures, the danger of inflammation will come, because the knife is not disinfected. If inflammation occurs, the entire eye will enter a dangerous situation. The shallowest degree is ulceration, blurred vision and even blindness. So, dear coworkers! Don't let people mess with your precious eyes.</p>
<p>Not only workers have this danger, but we also have a high chance of getting iron filings in our eyes when we walk on the road. On the road, you may encounter iron-drilling craftsmen. Iron filings often fly from under his chisel into your eyes. Whenever two irons touch each other forcefully, hot iron filings will be produced. If there is no doctor nearby, if iron filings or other things get into your eyes, we can try to protect ourselves temporarily.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>If you have boric acid ointment or soft petroleum jelly (not saturated with carbonic acid), you can apply some to your eyes, and then close your eyes. Ointment has a lubricating function, which can prevent the cornea from being damaged by the friction of the iron filings inside. If you don't have the two medicines, you can put some castor oil, or olive oil, or vegetable oil in a small cup, and then boil it in boiling water for about a quarter of an hour (do not let the water splash into the oil). After the oil has completely cooled, please have someone slowly pour it into your eyes. It is best to use an eye dropper, followed by a disinfected (boiled) teaspoon. One or two drops is enough each time. Too much will irritate your eyes. Once the oil is in, you can close your eyes; it is best to keep both eyes fully open, because the movement of one eye will definitely affect the second eye. If there is an effect, there will be irritation.</p>
<p>So, friends, when you go out, it is best to always carry some boric acid ointment in an eye drop tube. In the event of an incident, use the tube to directly apply the medicine to your eyes. Do not use matches, toothpicks, or handkerchief corners to replace it. The most important thing is not to put eye stones or rapeseed in your eyes, hoping that she will move around inside and knock out the iron filings. For example, if we use a large bomb to blow up a small tree, although the tree is removed, everything around it will be lost. So you must strongly remember that when dust or iron filings get into your eyes, if the method I said at the beginning does not work, you should go to a doctor immediately, otherwise there is a risk of inflammation and even disability.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Headache Treatment <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Headache is a very common problem, so there are plenty of headache medicines on the market. When ordinary people have a headache, they go to buy headache medicine to relieve the pain. Few people ask why they have a headache. But now is the 20th century, an era of scientific prosperity, and medicine is advancing by leaps and bounds. We should use the knowledge of modern medicine to study and understand why we have a headache. We must know the cause of the headache in order to treat the headache fundamentally. Otherwise, taking headache medicine for a headache is just a perfunctory matter and not a fundamental solution. Taking headache medicine every time you have a headache, if you take too much, can also weaken your body. The latest medicine is to first find out the cause of the disease and then treat the symptoms accordingly, so it can be cured in all cases. This is the meaning of the rational treatment method in this article. The causes of headache are described below.</p>
<p>(A) Headaches are caused by toxins in the body. For example:</p>
<p>(1) When a person has a fever from illness, the body produces toxins, and the patient often has a headache.</p>
<p>(2) Toxins are produced spontaneously in the body, such as when the bowels are constipated. The large intestine absorbs toxins into the blood, so people with constipation often have a dull headache.</p>
<p>(3) There is an increase in waste products in the body due to imperfect kidney excretion function, so people with chronic nephritis often have headaches.</p>
<p>(4) Excessive cirrhosis of the liver or other diseases that damage the liver and hinder or reduce the liver's detoxification function also often cause headaches.</p>
<p>(5) Thyroid disease can also cause headaches.</p>
<p>(B) Headaches are caused by blood vessel diseases. For example:</p>
<p>(1) Heart fire. (2) Poor blood circulation. (3) High blood pressure. People with higher blood pressure and obesity often have headaches due to high blood pressure. (4) Hardening of the blood vessels in the elderly also often causes headaches. (5) Anemic people often have headaches due to insufficient blood in the brain. (6) Severe lung disease also causes headaches. (7) Syphilis. Old syphilis is especially called a headache.</p>
<p>(C) Headaches are caused by local diseases. For example:</p>
<p>(1) Eye strain, such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and eye inflammation. Note: This is a particularly common cause of headaches. (2) Inflammation of the ear, nose, and throat. (3) Meningitis and neurological diseases. (4) Uterine diseases and uterine malposition.</p>
<p>Rational Treatment Method</p>
<p>From the above, in order to fundamentally solve a headache, you must first know the definite cause of the headache. These are described separately below.</p>
<p>Treat fever for headaches caused by fever. When the fever is cured, the headache will disappear.</p>
<p>For constipation, have a bowel movement every day. Method: Eat foods with more residue to make bowel movements easier every day. If you have a long-term constipation habit, you can take laxatives.</p>
<p>People with kidney disease should treat kidney disease. People with liver disease should treat liver disease. People with thyroid disease should also be treated.</p>
<p>If you have a habit of taking too much medicine, you must stop taking useless medicines.</p>
<p>If you have heart disease and heart inflammation, you must cure the heart disease. If the blood circulation is not smooth, make the blood flow smoothly.</p>
<p>High blood pressure must be treated to lower blood pressure, such as improving diet and helping excretion. When blood pressure is lowered, not only will the headache be gone, but the risk of stroke will also be gone.</p>
<p>For anemia, please ask a doctor to find out the cause of the anemia. First remove the cause of the anemia and then treat the anemia. When the anemia is cured, the headache will naturally disappear.</p>
<p>Headaches caused by lung disease must be treated for lung disease.</p>
<p>People with headaches who have had syphilis should not forget to be injected to treat syphilis.</p>
<p>Among the local causes, eye disease is the most important, and it also occupies an important position among all the causes. People with nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism use more eye strain than others when reading and doing fine work, so headaches occur. Wearing appropriate glasses can cure this type of headache. Students and people who use their eyes a lot must understand this pathology.</p>
<p>If headaches are caused by ear, nose, throat, or neurological diseases, the headache will be cured after removing the cause.</p>
<p>For women, if headaches are caused by uterine diseases or uterine malposition, curing the uterine disease or correcting the uterine position can eliminate the headache permanently.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Treatment of Pulmonary Cavities <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Combined Artificial Pneumothorax, Phrenic Nerve Resection, and Rib Resection</p>
<p>In our clinical practice, we often encounter patients with cavernous pulmonary tuberculosis in both lungs, whose treatment is the most difficult. Although sunlight, fresh air, nutrition, and rest are of great help in treating the lungs, they cannot exert their inherent functions in such cases. Symptomatic treatment, moreover, inevitably leads to the lament that medication is ineffective. Thus, we sit idly by as the patient's condition deteriorates day by day, groaning in bed. There is hardly a more miserable scene in life than this.</p>
<p>In ancient times, it was said that tuberculosis was certain death because there was no specific medicine to eradicate the tubercle bacilli. Although modern medicine is becoming more and more advanced, a specific medicine has not yet been discovered since the discovery of the tubercle bacilli. However, in sanatoriums, the treatment results for unilateral lung disease after various operations have been performed are quite astonishing. Although it cannot be said to be completely effective, severe cases are alleviated, mild cases are cured, hemoptysis is stopped, and high fever is eliminated. As for weight gain and reduction of sputum volume, they are even more common. Some cases relapse, either due to financial limitations and the inability to obtain sufficient treatment, or due to neglecting daily health maintenance. However, the overall results for unilateral pulmonary tuberculosis can be called excellent. However, there is still no excellent treatment method for bilateral pulmonary tuberculosis. Recently, at the Shanghai Tuberculosis Sanatorium, I have performed combined surgery on patients with cavities in both lungs. I will briefly describe it below.</p>
<p>A certain gentleman, 28 years old, was not in good general condition. He had had lung disease for more than three years, with a lot of coughing and phlegm. Tubercle bacilli were found in the sputum. On the X-ray, the upper half of the left lung was entirely shadowed, and bubbling sounds could be heard. An attempt at artificial pneumothorax was ineffective due to pleural adhesions. Therefore, phrenic nerve resection was performed first. However, this nerve resection did not have a superior effect in this case. However, it was performed to prevent danger before rib resection (i.e., complete cessation of work in the upper left lung), so the phrenic nerve resection was performed first to slightly elevate the left diaphragm to reduce the respiratory work of the left lung.</p>
<p>Then, I and the surgeon resected four ribs in a triangular shape from the back of the upper part of the left lung, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. The affected part of the upper end of the left lung, which could not be compressed due to pleural adhesions, collapsed at this point.</p>
<p>At the same time, because a cavity was found in the upper part of the right lung, a small amount of artificial pneumothorax was performed two days before the rib resection, and it is still being continued. For more than two months now, all subjective and objective symptoms have improved a lot, and he is now going to the countryside for convalescence.</p>
<p>As for the prognosis, it is difficult to predict within this very short period of time. If proper recuperation and legal diagnosis and treatment can be obtained, there is still great hope for recovery. This depends on the patient's continued efforts. This surgical treatment is far better than the original medical treatment, which could only lead to waiting for death.</p>
<h3 id="e25">A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (20) <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>(5) Sputum: When coughing is mentioned, people usually think of excessive sputum. These two symptoms are almost like sisters. Although some people have only a dry cough and very little sputum. At the beginning of pulmonary tuberculosis, the amount of sputum is usually very small. It is purely mucous or mucoid and transparent. This sputum comes entirely from inflammation of the bronchial tubes, especially from the hilar glands. At this stage, the disease is mostly closed. However, even if tubercle bacilli are sometimes found in the sputum, it is not necessarily an exception. As the disease gradually progresses, the sputum is mostly mucopurulent, but the pus and mucus are not closely integrated, like in bronchitis and bronchiectasis. This kind of pus is mostly due to the formation of cavities in the lungs. It is originally very thin and fluid. When it passes upwards through the bronchial tubes and trachea, it is wrapped and aggregated by mucus, resulting in different forms such as linear, spherical, and coin-shaped. This is what we usually call spherical sputum and coin-shaped sputum. The pus produced in these cavities, in addition to mostly containing tubercle bacilli, also often contains other pyogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus, Tetradococcus, and Pneumococcus. In particular, the significance of Streptococcus in mixed infections is especially important.</p>
<p>(6) Hemoptysis: This is a symptom that makes people "turn pale at the mention of a tiger." Most patients, if they find that they have coughing and excessive sputum, and even that their bodies are thinner than before, regard it as insignificant and do not care at all. But if fresh blood streaks are found in the sputum, they mostly know that it cannot be delayed any longer, and will almost immediately go to a doctor to find a solution. This situation is very common in general society in our country. In fact, this is not entirely the case. We must know that examples of pulmonary tuberculosis causing direct life-threatening danger due to massive bleeding are very rare, far less than those of gastric ulcer and cirrhosis. Furthermore, hemoptysis does not necessarily occur when pulmonary tuberculosis is severe; it is also often found at the beginning of the disease. The prognosis of this kind of early hemoptysis is not necessarily bad. Sometimes, patients dare not be negligent because of this, and are happy to accept long-term recuperation and fundamental treatment, and do not regard the doctor's advice as trivial. As a result, they recover. In fact, there are many examples of this. Therefore, hemoptysis is undoubtedly a serious warning to patients. But I dare to say boldly that this warning is by no means unfounded, and is sometimes actually very beneficial.</p>

<p>(14) Nasal Polyps (commonly known as nasal fungus)</p>
<p>Nasal polyps (Maseupolyp, also known as mucous nasal polyp, Schleimpolypo) are what people generally call nasal fungus. It is a very common and important disease in nasal diseases. We also often encounter it in clinical practice. It is not a true tumor. It is simply a chronic inflammatory product. Its occurrence will never occur alone. There must be a causative disease as its origin before it can occur. The most common causative diseases are rhinitis and sinusitis (such as maxillary sinusitis and ethmoid sinusitis). This disease occurs most often in adults. It is very rare in children. Based on my more than ten years of clinical experience, I have never seen a child with nasal polyps. Nasal polyps mostly grow on the middle turbinate of the nasal cavity, or originate in the paranasal sinuses. Sometimes they grow in the nasopharynx, called choanal polyps. Nasal polyps often have thin stems, or broad bases. In the beginning, their shape is mostly spherical. If they grow larger later, they can become cystic, strip-shaped, or cockscomb-shaped. Their surface is very smooth. The color is grayish-white, or grayish-yellow, with a glassy luster. If a probe is used to test their hardness, they feel soft like jelly.</p>
<p>The main symptoms of this disease are nasal obstruction. Nasal breathing is impaired. Nasal secretions increase significantly, and are mucous or purulent. Patients often feel headaches and dizziness. After a long time, their spirits gradually decline. Memory often deteriorates. Patients sometimes suffer from sneezing. The nasal cavity often feels itchy. This is because the nasal polyps stimulate the nasal mucosa. Nasal polyps are prone to bleeding. Therefore, when a doctor examines them with a probe, or when a patient inserts a finger into the nostril and touches the nasal polyps, it can often cause nosebleeds.</p>
<p>The best and most appropriate treatment for this disease is to have a specialist explore its causative disease. Is it rhinitis or sinusitis? If the causative disease is sinusitis, then there is even more of a causal relationship. For example, if sinusitis is not treated for a long time, pus continuously flows out of its natural opening, and the mucosa is stimulated by the pus. At this time, it is very easy to develop chronic inflammatory products. These products are nasal polyps. On the one hand, the natural opening of the paranasal sinuses is narrowed by the newly formed nasal polyps. The natural function of pus drainage is also impaired. Sinusitis becomes even more severe. In this situation, surgery should be performed immediately. Use a cold snare (wire loop) to remove or strangle the nasal polyps. On the other hand, fundamental treatment of sinusitis should be carried out. Once cured, there will be no pus. Since the mucosa is not stimulated by pus, the recurrence of nasal polyps can naturally be avoided. People often say that nasal polyps will grow back even if they are cut off, so why bother cutting them off? This is all because the causative disease was not treated after the removal. Readers of this article may be able to explain this doubt.</p>

<h3 id="e27">The True Essence of Popular Language (Part 1) <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jinxi</p>
<p>Regarding the term "popular language," please forgive my ignorance, I simply don't know what the differences or similarities are between it and "national language" or "vernacular"! However, things are not that simple, just interpreting it literally, it is indeed different from "national language" and "vernacular": "national language" is spoken in contrast to "foreign language," "vernacular" is spoken in contrast to "classical Chinese," "popular language" is spoken in contrast to "minority language"—language limited to a certain class (such as the so-called "comprador vernacular" or occupational use, etc.) or a certain place (such as dialects) can only be called "minority language." But "popular language" must also be limited to a certain era (such as the vernacular short stories of the Song and Yuan dynasties and the vernacular novels of the Ming and Qing dynasties, most of which were based on the "popular language" of the time, but now many not only cannot be spoken but also cannot be understood; today's "popular language" also advances with the years and changes with the times), and is limited to a certain country or a certain ethnic group (if "popular language" breaks through national boundaries, then it is "world language," which is not within the scope of this discussion). Then, the language that most people of a country and the entire nation can simultaneously understand and speak to each other is called "popular language." If the definition of "popular language" is indeed like this, then I still don't know what the differences or similarities are between it and "national language" or "vernacular."</p>
<p>However, things are still not that simple, all nouns have their own origins. Opening the material drawer of the China Dictionary Compilation Office, the noun "popular" has already existed in ancient times, and on the one hand is also an imported product. It can be used as a noun, or as an adjective, added to all other nouns, and thus "popular language" is produced from it. Forgive my verbosity! I will first pre-compile a long entry on "popular" for the dictionary (the original long draft was proposed by Mr. Wang Shuda, which was ultimately too "long," so only an excerpt is made here):</p>
<p>(1) In ancient usage, "popular" refers to a large group of peasants who were conscripted to serve as soldiers and workers. This is evidenced in the "Classics": "Book of Rites, Monthly Ordinances: "Early spring... do not gather the 'masses,' do not build city walls." (Zheng's note: "To prevent the beginning of farming." Song Zhangfu's explanation of the Monthly Ordinances: "Do not gather the masses, do not assemble large groups of apprentices; do not build city walls, do not undertake large-scale corvée labor.") "Early summer... do not start construction projects, do not dispatch the 'masses.'" (Zheng's note: "To prevent silkworm farming.") "Midwinter... do not build houses, and do not dispatch the 'masses.'" Also evidenced in the "Masters": Wu Zi (Wu Qi of the Warring States period) "Contingency: "Now there are few soldiers, who suddenly strike the gold and beat the drums on a narrow road, even if there are 'masses,' none will not be shocked." (This refers specifically to the large apprentice teachers during wartime.) Lü Shi Chunqiu, Summer Record of Sound and Music: "In the month of Zhonglu, do not gather the 'masses,' inspect and encourage agricultural affairs." Han Gao You's note: "Culu, April; 'masses' refers to military brigades and corvée labor," This is the official interpretation of the term "masses" in ancient times. Also evidenced in the "History": Book of Han, Biography of the Xiongnu: "When the Chanyu fled, his soldiers often mingled with the Han soldiers and followed the Chanyu. The Chanyu was unable to reunite with his 'masses' for a long time." (This also refers specifically to military brigades during wartime.) Therefore, the term "masses" was commonly used in ancient times, and its meaning was "large groups of peasant soldiers and peasant workers," but all were conscripted by those "above." (All previous dictionaries have missed the ancient meaning of this term: only Zhai Hao's Common Customs, Volume 8, Martial Arts category, has an entry on "masses," which also quotes a sentence from Guanzi, but is mistaken.)</p>
<p>(2) By the Middle Ages, the usage changed, and "masses" referred to monks, nuns, and lay Buddhists gathered together. This was a transliteration of the Indian "imported product." Originally, the Sanskrit word "Sangha" was translated as "community," with the meaning of harmony (originally just a "collective noun" of grammar, but the Buddhist world of the Tang and Song dynasties pointed out the number, such as the Lotus Sutra Xuanzan, according to the old meaning of the word "community," said "three people or more"; Tiantai Guanjing Shu said "four people or more, even hundreds of thousands of immeasurable"; Lotus Sutra Yishu added restrictions, saying "four great or more, up to twelve thousand people or less." A monk cannot be with the "Sangha", just as one cannot be called "community," as Ji Gui Zhuan 3 says: "One cannot say monk so-and-so, Sangha is Sangha, referring to the 'masses,' how can one tolerate one's own self, and immediately say four people? There is no such law in the West." But the customs of the Middle Kingdom are difficult to follow the Western law, so it is also said: "Distinguish as monks, the principle is also correct." Now the northern language often says, "Seven Communities chant scriptures," but calling one monk can also be called "one community," which is most common.) While "masses" are used to translate the Sanskrit word "Moha-Saingha", as in the Lotus Sutra, Introduction: "The World Honored One is in the 'masses', expounding the profound meaning of the Dharma." (The Treatise on Wisdom says: "The masses are all sages except for the Buddha." Originally limited to tonsured monks and nuns, but the Vimalakirti who entered the gate was a "layman," and "heavenly women" also became believers, so on this definition of "masses," the addition of "layman, female layman" is presumed to be acceptable.)</p>
<h3 id="e28">Talking About the Twenty-Five Dynastic Histories While Answering Mr. Lengmo <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Gaizun</p>
<p>A few days ago, "Free Talk" published an article by Mr. Lengmo, entitled "Starting from the Twenty-Four Dynastic Histories," which mentioned the "Kaiming Edition Twenty-Five Dynastic Histories" currently being printed. He said that our method of printing this large thing into a small nine volumes, invisibly increased people's courage to read it; and said that the pricing of this book is also considered cheap, and its non-profit seeking is also commendable. After reading these words, we deeply appreciate his kind intention to praise us.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Lengmo seems not very supportive of our plan to reprint the entire history and sell the entire set. He advocates re-editing the entire history by category, selling it by category, to meet the needs of people who specialize in studying a certain aspect; he expressed many valuable opinions on classified re-editing. In our opinion, people who are interested in history will definitely express considerable agreement with his opinions.</p>
<p>We also had a plan for classified re-editing early on, and it can be said that it is roughly the same as Mr. Lengmo's opinion. There are two reasons why we are not implementing this plan first and reprinting the entire history first. First, we believe that in addition to people who specialize in studying a certain aspect, there are people who need to have the entire history by their side for reference at any time; and the libraries and school libraries in various places are established to meet the needs of people with different needs, and should especially have the entire history. Second, our method of printing this abridged version with specially cast zinc plates has a bit of an experimental meaning. If we are praised by everyone and the book sells, we will continue to walk this road and print other books; and the demand for the entire history seems to be larger, so we will reprint the entire history first as an experiment.</p>
<p>Our plan for classified re-editing is as follows: to collect the "books," "records," and "tables" of each history by category, so that each becomes a system. If the original book does not have these categories, such as the Records of the Three Kingdoms, we will try our best to adopt the things supplemented by later generations, such as Hong Liangji's Supplement to the Records of the Three Kingdoms' Territorial Records, Hong Yisun's Table of Officials of the Three Kingdoms, Hou Kang Yao Zhenzong's Supplement to the Records of the Three Kingdoms' Art and Literature, Wu Zengjin Yang Shoujing's Table of Counties of the Three Kingdoms, Zhou Jiayou's Table of Years of the Three Kingdoms, Zhou Mingtai's Table of Genealogy of the Three Kingdoms, etc. Even if the famous histories already have these categories, if later generations have made accurate supplements, such as Sun Xingyan's Supplementary Catalog and Textual Research of Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian, Heavenly Officials, Zhang Zongyuan Yao Zhenzong's Textual Research of the Book of Sui's Classics Records, etc., we will also try our best to adopt them. We not only want to compile the biographies of foreign countries, the biographies of the barbarians, the biographies of the Xiongnu, and the biographies of the Western Regions, etc., into special volumes, as Mr. Lengmo said; we also want to collect the biographies of the Confucian scholars and literary figures of various histories, so that they become a long series in academic history and literature; those figures who are listed in special biographies but have a great reputation in academic articles, such as Ouyang Xiu and Wang Anshi in the History of the Song Dynasty, we will also separately include their biographies. In this way, in Mr. Lengmo's view, he may have to say "that's what I had in mind!"</p>
<p>Finally, talking about the issue of low prices. Mr. Lengmo believes that if it is arranged, printed, and bound like the popular novels that are currently popular, the selling price seems to be even cheaper. In fact, this cannot be imitated. The sales of popular novels are calculated in hundreds of thousands or two hundred thousand, and when averaged out, the selling price can of course be extremely low. Our Twenty-Five Dynastic Histories will definitely not have that many sales. Moreover, we require the font to be clear and there to be no typos, so we use photographic zinc plate printing, and the ink and binding must also be quite particular: the cost increases, and the selling price naturally cannot be compared with popular novels. We believe that Mr. Lengmo can also understand this point.</p>

<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>After four o'clock in the afternoon in spring, Guangzhou puts on a soft and beautiful coat; Gaodi Road, lying at its southern end, is like a bright and charming necklace wrapped around colorful ornaments. On this road, those ornate shops selling silk fabrics, shoes, and various ornaments for women, shouting anxiously to attract customers, proudly boast, adding a lot of charming color to this hypocritical metropolis.</p>
<p>At the eastern end of Gaodi Road, on the left side, there is a "Lüheng" shoe store with a very shallow and narrow storefront and not very large scale. In the store, the chubby boss, whose face, eyes, mouth, and nose all have a consistent round shape, and who exudes a very shrewd spirit, is running back and forth in front of the right-angled counter, taking care of customers on the one hand, and directing the two young partners, one fat and one thin, on the other hand.</p>
<p>While four female students wearing the same neat and clean gray clothes and black skirts were meticulously and troublesomely pointing out the flaws in a pair of yellow fine beaded leather high heels to the boss, a soldier in his thirties, of medium height, wearing a tattered military uniform, and with a wooden leg clamped under his left arm, suddenly walked in. He stepped into the store, threw the wooden leg aside, and sat down on the long bench, shrinking himself as if to make himself smaller. His rough right hand pinched the thick, dirty hair upward, and his yellow-gleaming eyes, deeply hidden under thick eyebrows, stared at the female students on the opposite side, who opened their mouths as if frightened.</p>
<p>"A-Biao, ask that customer if he wants to buy anything?" the boss ordered unhappily, and then tried his best to use his smooth tongue to gently wash away the female customers' uneasiness.</p>
<p>"Rubber-soled shoes." The soldier, who had lost his left leg, answered the shop assistant, and turned his head to look at the diverse, flowing people on the road. The sharp and complex car horns and the sounds of conflict or harmony between people constituted a prosperous and noisy realm. In the milky and charming air, he seemed to rise from the chair. He carefully used his left hand to grab the excess left trouser leg, and the other hand caressed the knife scar in the middle of the black brush-like beard on his right cheek, deeply fearing that the turbid atmosphere of the city would insult his past achievements. He sighed, turned his face up flat, calm as if tidying up his fragmented mood; recalling the winter two years ago, how fiercely he fought with the Japanese soldiers in Wusong, and how he lost his left leg that night.</p>
<p>When the shop assistant handed him a pair of green canvas shoes, he picked up a shoe with a weary expression and examined it carefully, and finally tried it on his only foot.</p>
<p>"How much money?"</p>
<p>"Nine jiao a pair." The thin shop assistant answered listlessly, and after speaking, his eyes were fixed on the female students who were about to agree on a price.</p>

<p>We have said quite a lot already. In short, talking alone is not enough, what is important is doing. Many people need to do it: the masses and the pioneers; all kinds of people need to do it: educators, writers, linguists...

<p>Although this good method of pulling and towing or steering the rudder can also be discussed orally, it mostly benefits from experimentation. No matter how we look at the wind and water, the goal is only one: to move forward.</p>

<p>I was taken aback, and when I looked, it turned out to be another colleague of my younger brother.</p>
<p>"Hey, don't make such jokes." My younger brother said sternly.</p>
<p>"Damn it, what joke are you making, let's go, let's play cards."</p>
<p>"You know I haven't been playing cards lately, I don't have any money." My younger brother's eyeballs were staring, and I thought he was going to get angry. Suddenly, a senior military officer in a gabardine military uniform flashed out at the street corner, and the colleague quickly turned his back, stood at attention, and saluted.</p>
<p>My younger brother pulled my sleeve and said:</p>
<p>"Let's go!"</p>
<p>We turned the corner at once, avoiding those two people. I really didn't expect that after only two years of not seeing each other, my younger brother had changed so much. Although his eyes were shining with innocence, his face was shrouded in silence. His military uniform was no longer particular, and the sloping belt he was using was now narrow.</p>
<p>"Younger brother, what about the belt I gave you?"</p>
<p>His face flushed slightly, and he replied:</p>
<p>"Hey, I don't want it anymore! So-so."</p>
<p>I stayed for two days, and he told me many indignant things. He still regretted not having read more books earlier, otherwise he could have left. He was very sad when he said this. When I was about to leave, he saw me off very far, grabbed my hand warmly, looked at me with wide eyes for a long time, and then sighed and said:</p>
<p>"Brother, I will definitely save some money, I will definitely come. I really don't want to do this kind of sacrifice!"</p>
<p>Tears welled up in his eyes, and I was also very sad. I walked far away from him, and still saw that he had not turned his head back. Oh, who knew, this time was actually a farewell forever!</p>
<p>It has already been several years since I came out again. I have learned many lessons from my wandering life. My younger brother, one year he couldn't come out, two years he couldn't come out, three years, and finally he sacrificed under the bullets!</p>
<p>Oh, sacrificed! What does it matter? But someone else is using binoculars on a high mountain and saying, "The First World War was just like this!" (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e33">Examination of Standards for Adulterated Cotton <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Xianfang</p>
<p>It is a widely acknowledged consensus that the adulteration of domestic cotton with water and other substances degrades its quality and hinders textile production. Strict measures must be taken to eliminate these practices and avoid unnecessary losses. Recognizing this, the government has formulated and promulgated regulations to address these issues. This action has long been sought by textile factories and technical organizations. The elimination of these long-standing malpractices and the imposition of severe penalties are undoubtedly justifiable. However, I have some reservations and wish to express my concerns regarding the first article, which stipulates that the statutory standard for domestic cotton is a water content of 11 percent. Furthermore, I would like to offer some clarifications on the eighth article, which limits the amount of foreign matter in raw cotton to 0.5 percent, a point that has been questioned and for which some have requested an increase.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the legal moisture content standard for raw cotton in various European and American countries is 8.5 li long, equivalent to 7.83 percent of the total weight. This is because raw cotton, after being dried at a temperature of 220 to 230 degrees Fahrenheit, still absorbs 8.5 percent of its weight in moisture when exposed to the atmosphere. This is therefore taken as the standard for the statutory moisture content. Atmospheric humidity varies with time and location, and the natural moisture content of raw cotton also varies accordingly. Therefore, the standard moisture content must be adjusted based on the humidity of the location. It remains to be seen whether the statutory standard moisture content for raw cotton in our country can be based on the world's statutory standard moisture content of 8.5 li long, and whether the 11 percent statutory standard announced by the government is higher than the natural content. This must be determined by whether the average annual humidity in our country is significantly higher than the average annual humidity in Europe and America. A comparison of the average annual humidity in various European and American locations, as well as Osaka and Shanghai, is provided below:</p>
<p>Location　Average Humidity　Location　Average Humidity</p>
<p>New York　74%　Manchester　80%</p>
<p>San Francisco　86%　Paris　79%</p>
<p>Mumbai　78%　Osaka　74%</p>
<p>Berlin　76%　Shanghai　80%</p>
<p>Average over 34 years, as seen in the Chinese Yearbook of Commerce</p>
<p>European and American countries use 7.83% as the standard for moisture content in raw cotton. In Europe and America, San Francisco’s particularly high humidity does not lead to an increase in the moisture content standard for raw cotton, in order to avoid the standard content being lower than the natural content, which would cause losses to cotton farmers. Therefore, in our country, where the humidity is similar to that of Europe and America, it would not be impossible to use 7.83% as the statutory standard, as is done in Europe and America. However, the fact that we do not follow the same standard as other countries, and instead set the standard moisture content at 11 percent, which is 3.17 percent higher than in other countries, means that every 100 jin of raw cotton contains 3.17 jin more moisture than it should, leaving room for merchants to add moisture and causing textile factories to suffer a material loss of 3.17 jin. From a scientific standpoint, this cannot be considered appropriate, accurate, or as thorough as textile factories and technical organizations would like in terms of eliminating long-standing malpractices. Some may argue that the market used to accept 12 jin as the moisture content standard, so is it not reasonable to reduce it by 1 jin? Would setting the standard at 7.83 jin, as in other countries, be too far removed from reality and difficult to implement? However, customary practices can be broken. The lack of progress in our country's industries is often due to these hidden obstacles. Money changers profit from the lack of a unified currency system, exploiting exchange rates to the fullest extent. Cotton merchants profit from factories competing to buy raw cotton, bringing in moisture-laden cotton, with moisture levels as high as 12 jin or more. Over time, this has become customary, as if 12 jin is the market standard for moisture content. Just as changing "liang" to "yuan" was convenient, adopting a rational scientific viewpoint and revising the statutory moisture content standard for raw cotton to 7.83 jin would align our country's raw cotton with that of other countries, correcting international perceptions. Not only would domestic textile factories avoid unreasonable losses, but it would also greatly benefit the export of raw cotton. The current standard of 11 jin still allows merchants to add 3.17 jin of moisture, leading to many potential problems. The second article of the provisional regulations states, "The maximum limit for moisture content in domestic cotton sold in the market is 13 percent." The third article states, "The sale of domestic cotton with moisture content exceeding the maximum limit is strictly prohibited." This means that the market can allow the sale of raw cotton containing up to 13 jin of moisture per 100 jin, only deducting the water exceeding the statutory moisture content of 11 jin. In other words, it is permissible under national law to sell cotton with added water. How can this eradicate bad habits and prevent the degradation of cotton quality, thereby preventing people from hoping for improper gains? Furthermore, merchants can profit by mixing moisture-laden cotton without being detected by buyers, and their profits will likely fall within the legally permissible range. If merchants fully load up cotton with moisture, will textile factories not end up receiving domestic cotton containing 13 jin of moisture? Raw cotton with a moisture content of 13 jin will inevitably undergo chemical changes if stored for a long time, significantly affecting its strength and color. Ordinary Chinese cotton stored until April or May of the following year will inevitably be of lower color quality than when it was initially purchased. The strength of the finished product will also be inferior to that of products made from cotton that has not been stored for a long time. Cotton with excessive moisture content will, of course, rot. However, American and Indian cotton stored in the same location for one or two years will not change in color or strength when used, because the moisture content is purely natural, within 8.5 li jin, unlike domestic cotton, which is artificially moistened, exceeding the natural content by a large margin. The hindrance to textile production, the degradation of finished product quality, and the increased generation of recycled silk and recycled cotton have long been felt by those engaged in this industry as an immense pain. Will this not drive them to prefer using foreign cotton? The production of domestic cotton is currently insufficient to meet demand, and storing it for a year or two is still not unheard of. If production increases to the point where, as in the United States, it must be stored for many years before being sold gradually, and it still contains the statutory 11 jin of moisture, it will be impossible to prevent it from rotting and becoming unusable. Cotton farmers and cotton merchants will then suffer losses. Even if cotton with excessive moisture content is sold before it rots, its color and quality will have already decreased, and its price cannot be raised. This can also be seen as merchants shooting themselves in the foot. Some may also argue that if the statutory moisture content standard for raw cotton is lowered to 7.83%, as in other countries, the market price will not increase due to the deduction of moisture, and merchants will suffer losses. However, the price of goods varies depending on supply and demand. If demand exceeds supply, the price will be high, and it will be impossible to suppress it. If supply exceeds demand, the price will be low, and even if manipulators deliberately raise the price, it will be difficult to sustain. Therefore, the price of cotton has little to do with the statutory standard moisture content. If this argument is necessary, it is intended to grab more water in place of cotton to compensate for losses when cotton prices are low, or to add water to cotton to reduce its substance and compete for sales at a lower price when cotton prices are high. This kind of behavior of using water to match market prices is definitely not possible. Furthermore, cotton merchants buy cotton from cotton vendors, and cotton vendors buy cotton from cotton farmers. From cotton farmers to cotton vendors to cotton merchants, all buy and sell within the statutory standard moisture content, with no adulteration. What moisture needs to be deducted? How can one suffer losses due to moisture deduction? Therefore, with regard to the provisional regulations on eliminating adulteration with water, the statutory moisture content must be changed from 11 jin to 7.83 jin, and this must be implemented in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Foreign matter in raw cotton is inherently nonexistent in our country. When the cotton bolls open and the cotton fibers are exposed, cotton farmers patrol the fields and pick them by hand, with no opportunity for dead branches and fallen leaves to be mixed in. This is unlike the United States, where large-scale farming and mechanized harvesting make it difficult to avoid branches and leaves being mixed in. Therefore, domestic raw cotton is purer than Indian and American cotton. In addition to artificial adulteration, the only natural impurities are wind-blown dust and sand, which are minimal. Ginned cotton is clean cotton. Unless the ginning machine is defective, whole cotton seeds will not come out with the fibers, and broken seeds will not be mixed into the fibers. Therefore, the eighth article of the provisional regulations on eliminating adulteration, which limits foreign matter to 0.5 percent, will never be reached under natural conditions. Setting this as a publicly permitted amount inevitably raises concerns about artificial adulteration. How is any increase possible? Some commentators, without careful consideration, have requested that the sale of cotton with more than 2 percent impurities should be prohibited in the market, but there is no basis for this request in academic principles or facts. This needs to be corrected. These are my initial thoughts on the newly promulgated regulations, offered to the nation for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e34">An Account Copied from Last Year's Customs Records <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Xinan</p>
<p>The economic situation of a country, whether prosperous or declining, should be known to its citizens. Knowing this, they can be alert to potential dangers and understand what needs to be avoided. However, a country's economic situation is complex and multifaceted. How can everyone be made aware of it? Therefore, there needs to be a simple report, such as customs records, for people to read, so that they can understand the general situation. However, some people find customs records to be voluminous and rarely read them. Recently, there has been a lot of attention paid to the export of silver, and people are urgently seeking measures to resist it, which is indeed an important task. However, if you look at the customs records, the export of silver is listed as a trade surplus and will be for the third year in a row! Why is it only being noticed now, instead of earlier? Isn't it too late? Fortunately, I am free and bored, so I will temporarily act as a "Teng Wen Gong," using the trade report published by the Customs in 1933 regarding the trade deficit and the inflow and outflow of gold and silver. To use a fashionable phrase, I will imitate Confucius's "transmit but not create" and extract information for the reference of readers:</p>
<p>"...Generally, when we look at China's huge trade deficit over the years, and the fact that silver is the only thing that can be used to offset it, we assume that raising the price of silver will reduce China's tangible trade deficit. However, upon closer analysis, we know that China is not a silver-producing country, so the silver it uses to offset the trade deficit must first be purchased from abroad. Therefore, what China urgently needs is to increase its ability to purchase silver. This shows that China's export prices must first be raised, or move in the same direction as silver prices, to be effective. However, at a time when China's silver production is declining and prices are falling, who would believe that raising the price of silver first would promote the use of silver in the East? I am afraid that the impact will encourage the import of foreign goods, and speculators will export silver to seek huge profits, leading to a potential outflow of silver from the country.</p>
<p>"Recently, China's import of silver has decreased due to the decline in export trade and the sharp drop in the prices of local products. By this year (1933), due to the principle of supply and demand, it has changed from a deficit to a surplus... "</p>
<p>"The amount of silver entering and leaving the country this year is extremely depressed, as can be seen in the following table of gold and silver imports and exports. The surplus even reached 14.4 million yuan. This surplus situation is not without precedent in Chinese trade history, as it was the case during the European War. At that time, the participating countries actively purchased silver in preparation for a prolonged war. As a result, silver prices soared, and exports increased sharply. As for this year, the United States abandoned the gold standard, and the value of Chinese silver dollars increased against the US dollar. Speculators competed to ship silver to the United States to seek huge profits, resulting in a large increase in the surplus. The import of silver from the United States this year was only worth 29.4 million yuan in national currency, while the export to that country reached 71 million yuan. It is clear that the US dollar is influencing the outflow of silver from China."</p>
<p>"Since the outbreak of the economic crisis, China's import of raw silver has been decreasing, which is undoubtedly a reflection of the domestic economic downturn. In view of the danger of raw silver outflow, the government stipulated that from April 6th of this year (1933), all exported silver bars, silver blocks, silver ingots, and other silver that can be used for coinage, except for Central Mint bars, will be subject to an export tax of 2.25% ad valorem to restrict it."</p>
<p>"China's ban on gold exports has been in effect since May 1930 and has not been relaxed to this day. The amount of gold exported with special permission from the government this year decreased by 39.9 million yuan compared to last year, as shown in the table below, while imports were roughly the same as last year. However, smuggling exports are certainly not small in number: not only can the number of seizures by customs be used as evidence, but also the huge export figures from Hong Kong below. Last year, Hong Kong officially imported gold worth HK$19.5 million and exported gold worth HK$63.7 million. This year, imports were only worth HK$6 million, while exports reached HK$88.9 million. Although the exact amount of gold transported from China to Hong Kong is unknown, it is certainly not insignificant. The following table compares the amount of gold and silver imports and exports and trade balance over the past ten years."</p>

<p>22　1,345,567　611,828　733,739</p>
<p>From the above three tables, we can see that: (1) Gold exports were banned long ago, and even if exports are allowed with special permission, they will still be exported, and there is no way to prevent them. (2) Silver was not exported in the early years for one reason: the world had no use for silver, so it was better to store it in silver-using countries like China. Now that silver has a destination, there is no reason why it would not be moved out. (3) Trade has not only been in deficit for the past ten years, but also in the past. For example, if we open a store, we import more goods from others than we export, and after settlement, we owe them money, which we ultimately have to pay in cash. Therefore, China only had a gold surplus in previous years (which can also be said to be expensive gold). Now that gold has been moved out in considerable amounts, even if the price of silver is not high, silver must also be moved out, especially since someone is buying silver.</p>
<p>Not only do we have to pay foreigners for the trade deficit, but we also have to pay foreigners for many other things. Let's list a few important ones:</p>
<p>(1) The principal and interest of indemnities for past defeats</p>
<p>(2) The principal and interest of foreign debts borrowed in the past</p>
<p>(3) The due profits and interest on investments in industrial and commercial enterprises</p>
<p>(4) Shipping costs</p>
<p>(5) Tuition fees for studying abroad</p>
<p>We only have expenditures, and they only have income: we will not discuss mutual exchanges for the time being (for a clear understanding of this situation, please refer to books on foreign exchange). As for the money that we Chinese can get from foreigners, it is shameful, fearful, and small:</p>
<p>(1) Foreign missionary expenses (mostly paid by the Chinese)</p>
<p>(2) Expenses for foreign troops stationed in China (they eat, use, and wear mostly their own things)</p>
<p>(3) Foreigners use the money they earn in China to invest in China. Although this is exploitation, fortunately there is this sum of money, otherwise the situation would be unimaginable.</p>
<p>We Chinese really shouldn't receive these few sums of money. And we have to pay foreigners so much money every year, which should have been unbearable long ago! In fact, it is not "bearable" now; it is like a bird's nest on a dangerous curtain! However, our country has another large source of income that can slightly offset the loss of foreign payments, which is the money earned by overseas Chinese through hard work. Although they are abroad, their hearts are in their homeland, and the amount of money they remit back every year is substantial. However, last year, the situation changed drastically. Let's look at what the customs records say:</p>
<p>"Xiamen: The trade balance has always relied on remittances from overseas Chinese to supplement it. In recent years, business in Southeast Asia has declined, and the economy of overseas Chinese has been extremely difficult. They have been returning to China in droves. The amount of money remitted back has been decreasing year by year, and the drop this year is especially large. According to estimates for this year, the amount of money remitted back this year has decreased from 40 million yuan in national currency last year to 30 million yuan..."</p>
<p>"Shantou... Many overseas Chinese have returned home, resulting in a large reduction in the amount of money remitted back this year. However, the exact amount of remittances is unknown due to a lack of statistics, but it is estimated to be no more than 25 million yuan."</p>
<p>"Jiangmen... Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have lost their jobs, and the anti-Chinese movement in Mexico is also very intense, resulting in a reduction of one-third in the remittances from overseas Chinese compared to last year. The huge trade deficit in this port cannot be offset, and commercial funds are very tight."</p>
<p>"Qiongzhou... The total value of cash and rice remitted back by overseas Chinese this year is 5 million yuan in national currency, which is said to be the total amount remitted back throughout the year!"</p>
<p>"Sheng Yue... In recent years, many Chinese workers in Burma have lost their jobs, and the amount of money remitted back has decreased sharply. There are not enough rupees in the market, and the exchange rate has increased."</p>
<p>With the above situation, the money that we Chinese rely on to pay foreigners is even more insignificant. As a result, the money owed to foreigners still has to be paid. May I ask, since the Chinese cannot use goods to offset it, what do they use to offset it? At present, there are many people discussing how to prevent the outflow of silver, but according to the situation recorded in the customs records, how can we reverse the inflow? Even if there is a solution, we should also know that a method that is beneficial to others may be harmful to others. Even if there are a hundred benefits and no drawbacks, we should also look at the environment. Don't benefit others while hurting yourself. Why make things difficult for your own people?</p>
<p>I am not speaking nonsense. There is no other way out except to be down-to-earth and help the industrialization effort. If there is, it is only a temporary solution. The so-called industrialization effort is to revitalize China's domestic industries in order to achieve self-sufficiency. Everyone should also thoroughly transform their "worship foreign" mentality. Don't value foreign goods and despise domestic goods; we should use domestic goods as much as possible. Domestic goods merchants should also not specialize in manufacturing domestic goods using foreign materials. They should quickly plan to switch to using domestic materials to live up to the name of domestic goods. At the same time, they should make efforts to pay close attention to quality and credit in all aspects and promote the export business. Then, there will naturally be a solution.</p>
<p>At present, we can only hope that the public will deeply remember to "save on foreign goods and use more domestic goods." With the public's determination, we can build a strong defense and perhaps be able to remedy the situation slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e35">The United States' Countermeasure to Nationalizing Silver <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Di</p>
<p>Why does the price of silver tend to rise when the United States nationalizes silver? This is because the United States' nationalization order requires civilians to hand over all silver (except for a few minor exceptions) to the mint within three months. The mint deducts 61.32% of the value as a coinage profit, and the remaining amount is paid to the silver seller at a price of 50.1 cents per ounce. This payment of 50.1 cents per ounce is not far from the current price of silver. However, the Silver Purchase Act of 1934 (the nationalization order is based on this law) stipulates that one silver dollar certificate should be issued for every ounce of silver received. The silver nationalization order also stipulates that "the silver certificate shall maintain a full silver reserve... when redemption is requested, it will be exchanged for standard U.S. dollars." This means that the silver initially purchased at a price of 50.1 cents per ounce will be worth $1.29 when used as a reserve to issue banknotes. In other words, one ounce of silver, initially worth 50.1 cents, will then be worth $1.29 without any discount. This is more than double the price of silver.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, speculation is naturally triggered, and in China, it naturally induces inequality in the price level between Chinese and foreign silver, leading to the outflow of silver. What are the consequences of the outflow of silver?</p>
<p>First, the emptiness of cash reserves. China adopts a decentralized issuance system for banknotes, meaning that not only the central bank can issue banknotes, but also many other banks issue banknotes. This is different from advanced countries that adopt a centralized issuance system. However, the issuance reserve system of advanced countries that adopt a centralized issuance system generally adopts a system of 40% cash reserve and 60% guarantee reserve; while China is exactly the opposite, with 60% cash reserve and 40% guarantee reserve. Therefore, excessive outflow of silver will inevitably affect the 60% cash reserve. Since cash reserves are reduced, the amount of banknotes in direct proportion to it will also be reduced, creating a phenomenon of deflation. At that time, prices will fall, and the economic downturn will be even worse.</p>
<p>Second, the disillusionment of the new silver standard currency. According to Article 11 of the Regulations for the Minting of Silver Standard Currency, the minting of China's new silver coins stipulates that "for silver with a fineness of 999 per thousand, each yuan shall contain 23.493448 grams of pure silver, plus a minting fee of 2.25% of one yuan." This means that the nominal value of one yuan of the new silver standard currency is 2.25% higher than its actual value. This 2.25% is the government's profit in the name of coinage difference, so the government's coinage revenue is about 90,000 yuan per month, with a minting volume of 4 million. So why are civilians willing to pay 2.25% to send silver to the mint to mint new silver dollars? This is because foreign countries are dumping silver in China, and the price of silver in China is higher than that in foreign countries. Therefore, instead of spending freight, insurance, packaging fees, etc. to transport Chinese silver to foreign countries for sale, it is better to pay this 3.25% to mint silver dollars in the country nearby. However, now, as a result of the United States raising the price of silver, the price of silver in foreign countries is higher than that in China. Therefore, instead of paying 2.25% to mint silver dollars, it is better to pay freight and insurance to sell them to foreign countries. As a result, not only will the number of newly minted silver dollars gradually decrease, but even the silver dollars that have already been minted may gradually be transported to foreign countries; thus forming the disillusionment of the new silver dollar currency, and the government losing a batch of coinage revenue every day, which is secondary.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the silver policy has much basis in academic theory (I have commented on this point in the 17th issue of the second volume of New China), this kind of impact on China is possible. So, what countermeasures should we have? Regarding this point, contemporary scholars have discussed it for a long time, but there is no perfect solution. In principle, I agree with Mr. Yin Pu's opinion that to stabilize the domestic currency position, it is necessary to break away from the relationship with foreign banks, but in terms of practical procedures, the "remittances cannot be cashed" method may not be permitted by foreign commercial banks, so we have to find another appropriate solution.</p>
<p>In my opinion, although silver is a commodity in the world, it is a currency in China; but currency has two functions, internal and external. For example, in countries that implement the gold standard, gold is a guarantee means within the country and can actually circulate, while externally it is a means of circulation and a method for settling international trade. It can be seen that silver in China, as a currency, still maintains the appearance of a free silver standard system. It is not only a means of circulation externally, but also a guarantee means internally, and at the same time a means of circulation. Therefore, it can be freely bought and sold, freely minted, and freely exchanged for cash, and freely enter and exit. Under such a free silver standard system, it is impossible to separate China's currency from the world silver price. To separate the value of China's currency from the world silver price, we must stop China's unlimited silver standard system and make it a "limited silver standard system"; this is the best method, which is to make silver only a guarantee means domestically and a means of circulation externally. In other words, stop cashing domestically, but do not prohibit silver exports externally; however, stopping cashing is often equal to prohibiting silver exports. Because stopping cashing makes it impossible to obtain silver for export; in this way, the method of repaying the value of imports will be exhausted. To remedy this point, the central bank may be ordered to buy and sell raw silver at exchange banks (such as the Bank of China); however, when civilians want to purchase silver from the central bank for export to pay for goods, they must be required to submit import certificates for the goods, etc., to show restrictions. In this way, China's silver is also equivalent to being nationalized.</p>
<p>However, before implementing this nationalization policy, China must improve its banknote issuance system. China must change its decentralized issuance system into a sound centralized issuance system, and the 60% cash reserve system may also be changed to 40%. Because centralized issuance means centralized reserves, which makes it easier to implement control, and reducing the cash reserve can save silver and strengthen the role of silver as a guarantee means.</p>
<p>With such measures, even if the price of silver continues to rise, our China can be less affected by it.</p>

<p>The Foreign Exchange Market Was Quiet on Sunday</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and banks were closed as usual, which made the market even quieter. The foreign exchange interbank offered rate in the market was 9 points in both the morning and afternoon sessions, a further decrease of 1 point compared to the previous day. In terms of settlements, due to the bank holiday, everything was completely suspended, with only transactions between money shops themselves. The total amount of foreign exchange settlements was over 29 million, and the amount of remittances from various places was over 200,000. In terms of interbank lending, the morning session saw 3.1 million in transfers and new transactions, the afternoon session saw 300,000 in transactions, the Small General Association saw 300,000 in transactions, and pawn transactions saw over 400,000 in redemptions and 200,000 in new transactions. The situation in the subsidiary currency market was still stable. Although the Jiangnan small dollars once fell slightly in the morning session, trading at 832.8 yuan, they still returned to 833 yuan in the afternoon session, so the result was still the same as the previous day. The volume of transactions was 3,000 jiao in the morning session and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Guangdong small dollars had slight fluctuations, trading at 748.8 yuan in the morning session and 749.3 yuan in the afternoon session. As a result, they rose by 1.3 yuan compared to the previous day. The volume of transactions was 90,000 jiao in the morning session and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Copper coins also did not fluctuate, remaining at 317,000 wen, with a transaction price of 125,000 yuan, equivalent to 40,645 strings of wen.</p>

<p>The Bond Market Trended Upwards Last Week</p>
<p>Gains Ranged from Over 1 Yuan to 3.23 Yuan</p>
<p>Last week, from September 3rd to 8th, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange gradually started to trend upwards after the situation turned slightly better the previous week. This was because the foreign exchange interbank rate gradually decreased, decreasing by 6 points in a week. The outflow of cash stopped because international silver prices gradually became balanced. The situation between Japan and Russia suddenly eased after being extremely tense. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee was held as scheduled, and there were no problems. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had already recovered his health, and the rumors were completely quelled. It was also heard that a certain bank would release 20% of its 40% cash reserve for banknotes to circulate in the market, and the shortfall would be made up with government bonds. The Bank Savings Law was about to be implemented. The foreign exchange interbank rate was expected to fall, and short sellers panicked. Table and northern speculators were the earliest and most aggressive in covering their short positions, and the market price rebounded. Intermediate table speculators turned short, but found that they could not apply their skills to suppress the market. The trend should continue to rise, and the saying that the 96 bonds would be reorganized had a cause but no factual basis, as it was not yet the time. Over the past week, the foreign exchange interbank rate rose by 1 point on Monday, but the environment improved, the atmosphere between Japan and Russia eased, and silver was gradually no longer a problem. Northern speculators first covered their short positions, and the market price suddenly turned around, recovering several jiao to over 1 yuan. The foreign exchange interbank rate continued to fall on Tuesday, and the upward trend was strong. There were full-day gains, with the 6th reorganization bond being the strongest, rising by 2.75 yuan. The upward trend continued on Wednesday, but the closing price fell by over 1 yuan due to a temporary disruption of telecommunications between Fujian and Shanghai, but the result was still a gain of several jiao to over 1 yuan. Almost half of the previous losses were recovered, which again caused table speculators to sell short, and the 4th also saw selling. The price rebounded by a small amount of jiao to 1 yuan on Thursday. On Friday, the report on the central government's financial situation was good. The 96 government bonds suddenly rose by 1 yuan, and the others also turned upwards by several jiao to over 1 yuan. The initial gains were still strong on Saturday, but then rebounded slightly. As a result, the gains and losses were uneven. As a result of the week's market prices, gains ranged from several jiao to 3.23 yuan. The total number of transactions was 154,833,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the following table:</p>

<p>Sutong Japonica Plummeted by 2-3 Jiao</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various sources suddenly increased, with over 20 dealers arriving (a total of 3,450 shi of goods), mostly thick japonica rice. Late rice was indeed in the minority, and sales were still sluggish. Therefore, with this surge in supply, people panicked, and the market situation deteriorated. For example, Sutong japonica rice plummeted by 2 jiao. Fortunately, common varieties such as Nangang rice and late rice were scarce and still soft. In addition, new japonica and new pointed rice continued to fall by over 1-2 jiao. Yinbianyuan also fell by a small amount of 2-3 jiao, and fragrant rice was not spared.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 23-24 dealers from various sources down the river. There was some trading of shorter-priced goods on the market. The market price for white japonica was high, and the medium and low prices were down by a small amount of 1 jiao. Early thin rice was high, and the medium and low prices were down by a small amount of 2 jiao. Dongxin japonica was down by a small amount of 2 jiao. Chen Yang Dujian was tired and cheap. The arrival of new Yang Dujian continued to be strong, but the price was not good, and the price was down by a small amount of 2-3 jiao. Bairyuan new and old guest points were also tired by several fen. Twenty shi of Xixin japonica arrived today. The rice quality was inferior to last year, and the price opened at 11.8 yuan.</p>
