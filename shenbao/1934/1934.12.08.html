<p>時評</p>
<h3>一九三五年的日本支出預算敬</h3>
<p>在本年度日本國庫的總支出中。軍費一項獨占百分之四四。其數字的龐大。實爲空前所未有。查一九三一年度。日本的軍費支出。占總支出額的百分之三○點四。共爲四萬零六百萬圓日金。去年遞增到了九萬三千六百萬圓。區區數年之間。竟漲高一倍有奇。那得不令全世界驚異。尤其是使他的鄰邦有所警戒呢。</p>
<p>一九三六年是日本所謂非常國難的年份。他爲先發制人計。要在一九三五年內宣告廢棄華盛頓和倫敦條約。主張軍備平等。此外又要一步一步的實現其所預訂的大陸政策。擴張軍備旣是其國策之一。增加軍費預算。當然是必有的結果。然而日本現時的財政情勢却很緊急。加稅過多。會使產業界金融界因負擔太重而陷於停滯發行公債。如超過去年的限度不但將使國庫負荷太重。而且會阻滯戰時財政的財源。到了眞正的非常時期。反將發生意外困難。這是日本財政界所最憂慮的事。總之。倚靠公債來支持財政。在政府方面的。確是不經濟。在人民方面。又間接的受到了負担。甚至使他們的子孫都不免於受債務的連累。所以日本財政界方面的識者。多在反對此舉。普通人民而有財政知識的。更以爲政府不當着眼於此。日本財政當局在編制預算案之初。乃亦竭力主張。不能突破今年預算的數字。就是發行公債。也不能超過七萬萬圓日金。可是在最後决定的數字中。陸軍還是加添了二千七百萬圓。海軍也加添了二千七百萬圓。合計陸軍費爲四萬九千一百萬圓。海軍費爲五萬三千萬圓。軍費支出共計十萬零二千一百餘萬圓。占總支出二十一萬二千五百萬圓中的百分之四八。比較今年新數字還要多出八千五百萬圓。和日俄戰爭時的支出已相差無幾。</p>
<p>現在國際間雖盛行着軍備的擴張。但是英美兩國的軍費支出還没有超過總支出的百分之十五。法國稍大。也不過占總支出的百分之二一。就是這樣。已經使得歐洲人心皇皇。最近海縮預備會談。已陷絶境。英美二國正在苦思焦慮。怎樣才能繼續維持其在遠東的旣得權利。日本軍費預算的增加。在她本身固然可說是防禦一九三六年的危機。毫無其他用意。但在世界一般的形勢上。終究有引起軍擴的必然性。要知道打破以往的海軍比率。旣爲美國所反對。而英國希望把握「海上王國」的威權的心理。亦和以前同樣的濃厚。如果日本眞要預備建造與英美同等的海軍力。他們豈甘落後而不去竭力競爭嗎。何况英美等强國又知道提倡軍需工業。本是調劑經濟恐慌的有效方法之一。那末。今後的軍備競爭。將比較一九二一年以前還要猛烈。國與國間的利害衝突比。較該年以前還要劇烈。都是在意料之中的。假令日本今後的對外輸出貿易。因各國限制日貨輸入的關係。或竟至於減低。届時產業虧損影響於財政方面的。必更較今日爲大。財政問題的確是日本政治上的難關。不知道日人在財政壓迫之下。究將如何支持其在國際會議中的立塲呢。</p>

<h3>日本宣告廢約日倫敦談判終止時</h3>
<p>條約兩年內依然有效</p>
<p>美仍盼覓取合作辦法</p>
<p>安全平等英美意見一致</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務院最高當局今日宣稱、日本廢止華盛頓及倫敦海軍條約之時、卽美國視爲倫敦海軍談話終止之日、並稱、據美國之意、日本之廢止條約卽無異於退出談話、惟如日本能同時提出確切之計劃、以代替華府及倫敦兩約之軍縮原則、談話當可繼續進行云、官塲方面更注意一事、卽日本雖宣布廢約、華府條約仍得有效至一九三六年底、希望該約失效以前、各國能有所成就、俾得實行軍縮及互相合作、美國代表台維斯所稱、日本如堅持廢約、則美國將與日本競爭造艦、以維持五·五·三·之比率、此間半官方面聞此、已發生極大之衝動、蓋以前華盛頓方面雖屢有此項表示、然正式宣布尙屬初次也、華盛頓觀察者謂、台維斯氏之言雖屬非正式性質、當由彼個人負責、然國務總理赫爾及羅斯福總統大槪已完全同意、且台氏之言係針對日本而發、台氏曾謂、美國之立塲係「安全平等」而非日本所要求之「軍備平等」也云云、英美兩國自開始海軍談話以來、卽力稱兩國雖願與日本共謀軍縮、然並無聯合對日之意、然據觀察者之意見、則英美兩國政策對於平等問題幾完全一致、卽台氏昨日所用「安全平等」一語、亦曾經英國外相西門於最近聲明英國政策時引用之云、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）海軍談話日本首席專門委員山本中將、頃向哈瓦斯社代表發表宣言、表示日本努力工作、以期成立一般恊定、謂「限制海軍之現行制度、行將消滅一層、余甚至不欲加以考慮、美國方面聲稱、如華盛頓海約一旦廢止、則海軍談判應立卽終止、此種態度、實所不解、須知日本廢止華盛頓條約之决定、當吾人自東京出發之前、已爲世人所週知、且當倫敦海軍談話開始時、吾人卽以此項决定正式通知各關係國、吾人今仍繼續工作、今後集會時日、雖未預定、但技術談話、當不至延遲云、山本又謂、華盛頓條約宣告廢止、有一便利之處、卽可使法意兩國參加談判、（按法意亦爲華盛頓條約簽字國、）然日本請求法意共同宣告廢約、迄未得法意兩國之滿意答復、殊爲遺憾云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本廢約招致海軍競爭</h3>
<p>美自信力能制勝日本</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國已通知日本反對海軍平等要求、並稱如日本必欲廢棄海軍條約、則海軍競爭勢所不免、美國並作有力暗示、認海軍競爭、美國力能制勝日本、此項宣言係美國軍縮代表台維斯在倫敦讌請新聞記者時非正式發表、台維斯宣稱、美國之立塲完全以條約中規定之安全平等爲基礙、並不以軍備平等爲根據、其他方案必爲美國所反對、放棄現行條約之原則、勢將引起阢隉及國際猜疑以至不利各國之軍備競爭、美國認廢棄保障各國安全之現行制度爲大不幸事、台維斯最後稱、吾人承認各國應享受安全平等之權利云、（六日國民電）</p>
<h3>倫敦考慮第二階段辦法</h3>
<p>當前兩項先决問題</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國人士以爲華府海約一經宣告廢止、則海會初步談話第一階段卽告失敗須另行開始談話、但談話之第二階段、是否卽由現在倫敦之各國海軍代表團依舊担任抑或另以外交手續進行、則目下尙未决定、惟舉行第二階段之談話時、必將先行討論若干先决問題、然後始能考慮一九三五年海軍會議之是否宜於召集、所謂先决問題者卽（一）能否由英美兩國先行訂立一種條約、僅規定質的限制而不涉及總噸數及比率、俾日本認爲相宜時可以隨時加入、而其他各海軍國亦得參加、（二）同時又由全體海軍國討論是否能彼此約定、各以本國每年造艦計畫通知其他訂約國、如談話之後、彼此認爲造艦計畫互相通知一層可以辦到、則一九三五年海軍會議卽以此爲主要議題、否則正式海軍會議卽無庸召集矣、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>艦噸質的縮减英國表示意見</h3>
<p>（倫敦）美代表台維斯昨日發言聲明美國準備接受噸數上量的縮减後、倫敦現已重行說明其關於噸數上質的縮减之意見、謂英政府始終反對主力艦飛機母艦與巡艦噸數之過大、前曾在日內瓦提議將此種軍艦之最高噸數及砲位口徑、加以縮减、英政府現準備接受縮减、而將此項之噸數加以百分三十之限制云、各大海軍國已多數贊成此議、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>日代表之詭辯</h3>
<p>認庇護僞國爲當然義務</p>
<p>現率不適用主另訂新約</p>
<p>（倫敦）日代表山本今日語路透訪員、言及美代表台維斯第一次正式宣佈美國對於海軍之地位事、謂日政府之所以改變其對於華盛頓海軍條約之態度者、原因不一、而其主因之一、則爲空軍之發展、再、日本亦覺負有保護「滿洲國」之責任、以免受來自附近地方如蘇俄或中國之危害、美國與日本所擬海軍縮减之方案、基本上實相歧異、日本欲得更大之縮减、尤欲縮减攻擊式之戰具、但最大異點、厥爲美國欲得保留比率、而日本則欲取銷比率、軍艦航程之增大、致使軍艦可距其國內根據地甚遠地方作戰者、亦爲日本覺華盛頓海軍條約不能充分應付海軍發展之一重要原因、日本不欲有海軍毫無限制之局勢、但欲有較爲合理與公允之新恊定云、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日本首席專門委員山本少將之親近僚屬某人、用日本語發表談話、由舌人傳譯、其用意在以初步談話失敗之責、諉諸美國、略謂一日本要求規定一種共同最高噸數、並不願在各種艦别上均皆逹到最高共同限度、吾人至今依然作此請求、足見妥恊心理、此吾人所不憚反覆言之者、」又謂、「英美兩國對於此點若能承認、則吾人卽可在技術上從長討論日本提案、如是則「在安全中求平等」一層、其最可靠之實施辦法、實係吾人所供給、世界人士均能共見矣、美國人士謂華府海約廢止之後、則同時簽訂之四國恊定·九國公約·亦卽因之失效、抑知吾人所擬宣告廢止之海約、在法理上實與四國恊定·九國公約·不相關連、吾人對於此種條約、固仍然遵守也、總之、凡在公允範團之內、以謀限制海軍、吾人始終努力不懈」云云、日本發言人此項宣言、係在美國代表台維斯發表演說之後、美國政府曾以訓令寄交台氏、說明美國政府態度、並謂日本正式宣告廢止華府海約之後、苟無新提議、能使人得有新希望、則白宮卽將海會談判現行階段加以結束、實有充分理由、凡此諸端、直至本日始由台氏洩露於外、至台氏所謂美國準備賡續華府倫敦兩種海軍條約、並在�</p>
<p>細目上加以修改一層、英國人士以爲該屬美國接受英國折衷案之朕兆、此在台維斯左右、則謂台氏之言、决不能作如是解、台氏僅謂現行海約如能賡續、則美國對於大型艦現行制度在英國所引起之抗議、願充分加以考慮云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美主普减二成</h3>
<p>英美爭點較易解决</p>
<p>（倫敦）海軍談話中似未提及海軍縮减之百分數字、但據華盛頓消息、美政府贊成將各種軍艦盡裁减二成、惟巡艦與飛機母艦不在其列、英國所稱英帝國海道遼廣、須有巡艦特多一節、美國不反對之、而美代表台維斯之言論、可視爲英美間所爭各點較易解决之表示、據路透社華盛頓訪電、國務總理赫爾不欲批評台維斯之言論、惟官塲明白表示、如日本正式</p>
<p>廢止華盛頓條約、則美國將　倫敦三國談判業已終止、此外辦法、惟有由日本另提海軍限制之方案耳、（六日路透電）</p>

<p>政友會總裁旣下裁斷承認政府豫算、因此解散議會說稍見緩和、然其所付條件之內容及豫算總會之結果如何、尙有產生種種問題之可能性·前途仍不許樂觀、（七日日聯電）</p>

<h3>日衆院續開通過預算案</h3>
<p>解散危機完全消滅</p>
<p>（東京）本日預算總會於下午一時半在緊張空氣開會、政友會鈴木總裁亦列席傍聽、最先由島田委員長發言、謂岡田首相昨日在會議有所答辯、政友會爲决定態度、商議種種、以致遲開會、實爲遺憾、政友會東武君及其他諸委員要求本委員長詢問政府意見、本委員長茲體諸委員之意、請問政府、首相昨日答辯中有「不吝考慮」等語、其意是非不吝考慮各議員質問內容之意、或係不吝考慮議員意見及國民大衆對於預算案意見、不甚明瞭、請首相明答、</p>
<p>岡田首相答、政府决無蔑視民意、實行政治之意、卽於今後實際情形、不吝考慮必要施設者、卽於今後實際情形、以誠意實行政治之意也、今後如有必要、則當考慮必要施設、政府考慮民意實行政治、此卽議會政治也、</p>
<p>島田委員長問、政府有無增加災害預算之意、</p>
<p>岡田首相答、現在提出預算之外、並無提出其定預算案之意、</p>
<p>島田委員長詢問政友會議員有無意見表示、大口喜六發言、謂政府之誠意可以諒解、據政府聲稱、災害預算係苦心編成之預算、然徵之實際情形、極大充分、</p>
<p>大口於是說明各地被災地之窮狀後、續言、謂如何救濟災地非但政黨應考慮之問題、係天下之輿論、首相旣言考慮國民總意、實行立憲政治、吾人認政府確有誠意、然則希望卽時停止各人質問、開始討論政友會所提動議、</p>
<p>岡田首相謂、本人之發言、將閱速記錄後、實行更正、亦未可知、</p>
<p>此時議塲騷然、島田委員長稱、如首相更正發言、則不得不暫停審議、</p>
<p>岡田首相答、委員長之解釋似有誤解、請諸君續行審議、</p>
<p>大口喜六此時起而曰、本人因認首相與委員長之解釋同樣、故有提出動議、</p>
<p>島田委員長乃宣票决大口之動議、結果决定採用、解散議會之危機於是始消滅、其後開始討論、可决政府預算案、遂於下午二時半散會、（七日日聯社電）</p>

<p>人數至多二千俄捷除外</p>
<p>（日內瓦）關於派遣國際軍隊前往薩爾區域、俾在公民投票期內、維持治安一事、德國政府業於今晚六時向薩爾問題三人委員會主席阿樂亞西提出答覆文曰、「昨日國聯會行政院開會時、各國代表對於在公民投票期內、維持薩爾區域治安所發表之宣言、德國政府業予閱悉在德國政府之意、薩爾治安原不必定由外方軍隊予以維持、但若國聯會行政院决定由中立國組織少數國際軍隊派往薩爾境內、則德國政府亦表同意也云云、此間一般人士皆謂德國復文、已使薩爾問題之國際階段得告結束、（意謂現所餘者僅公民投票此係薩爾內部問題）大約國聯會行政院或於明晨卽行開會、將關於維持薩爾治安問題之妥恊辦法、予以備案、此項妥恊之得成立、固由於法國外長賴伐爾之提議也、英意兩國軍官若干人將於明日抵此、與行政院所屬機關接洽組織國際軍隊事宜、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據日內瓦消息、德國來文雖贊成派中立國際軍隊前往薩爾、但認薩爾現狀未有需用外兵之必要、日內瓦德領事送交此文時、向國聯秘書長聲稱、德國已接到英意兩國政府之保障、其所謂保障者、殆指德國所慮利用俄兵並捷克兵及外兵駐紥薩爾時期兩事而言、據可恃消息、蘇俄與捷克國皆未要求參加也、</p>
<p>據衆意見、國際警兵有一千五百人至二千人卽可敷用、而組成此警兵隊者、將爲英比意三國之人、蓋以此三國皆來因地安全公約之簽字國也、聞荷蘭已被邀請、大約可望承認、無論如何、此事進行繫於薩爾管理委員會、衆信此委員會將立卽着手辦理公民大會時國際警兵隊之組織計畫、（六日路透電）</p>

<h3>國聯十五届大會郭泰祺出席演說之全文</h3>
<p>聲明中國對東北問題之立塲</p>
<p>本年九月十四日、日內瓦國聯大會舉行第十五届會議時、我國總代表駐英公使郭泰祺、在秘書長皮尼士博士（捷克代表）提出年報之後、即起而演說自稱以國聯遠東報告員之地位發言、詳述日本武力佔據滿洲及中國遠東數省引起之時局、同時並宣布中國遵守國聯對李頓報告書决議案所取之立塲與態度、其要略曾於九月十五日載見本報、昨本埠字林報載其全文、亟迻譯如下、</p>
<p>郭使曰、秘書長就其　職後、今第一次提出年報、非僅僅正式致賀所能示感也、渠詳論國聯在其最危急一年中之命運、渠見國聯復具威望、脫離是年、邇者引導一二國舍國聯以求解决之絶望、今已使全世界覺悟國際　讓之健全與安穩、僅能伏於國聯機構之內、中國擁護此復始之世界的情緒、毫不附有保留、中國代表團以全世界人民什二之名義、以握掌國家行政權最久的政府之一之名義、以亞洲最大的　勢力之名義歡迎曾經恢復的國聯勢力之明徵、惟中國不抱過分之樂觀、如其鄙視過分之悲觀、然皮尼士君於大會開幕詞中、暢論世界今日之局勢、余於皮尼士君廣博之學識、明切之見解、不能望其項背、惟當力求競勝其質樸之寫實主義、而專論世界大局中最與遠東有關及中國政府以爲最危害世界和平前途之各點、皮尼士君之分析時局也、使人注意遠東和平之隱患、其言曰、一中日間目前之局勢、與中俄間現有之緊張、此二事之特别重大、無人能予置辯、余之演說、初非立於爭執中之一方面之地位、乃立於須請諸君予以寬容國聯遠東報告員之地位、而根據國聯忠實會員全體接受關於遠東目前緊張性質與責任之報告書、此報告書以密切注意遠東事變發展之責任加諸大會之　、余之所以發此言論蓋爲輔助集於此間之吾人盡此責任耳、今有三主要點、願請大會注意者、</p>
<p>第一點爲全部爭案今仍開啟、外國工首所委在中國東北數省　其服役之傀儡、今自稱爲帝、此事並未更變破壞國聯盟約武力佔　之性質、中國僅在必須忍受時而忍受之、國聯全體對此佔據、已通過最後之裁判、國聯今仍受其裁判之約束、一年之前、大會開年會時、中國代表曾發言曰、一中國政府視四省之局勢、爲條約固定的破壞、此諸約者、衆意世界之安全·軍縮·和平·咸將賴之、中國政府决計堅毅維持其一切權利與要求、决不承認或默認憲法造成之事實、此種違法造成之事實、僅將於中國在國力上不能或國聯餘部在政治上不能擁護諸約之尊嚴時留存</p>
<p>吾國之抱此態度、以爲不特已盡吾人無助的權力保持中國土地之完全與政治之獨立、以抗拒日本之侵略、中國之出此、目爲抵禦將國聯盟約化爲一紙文之企圖也、厥後大會採納一九三三年二月二十四日其一致的報告書、中國恪遵書中决議各條所載之義務、滿望報告書中之建議、能速實施、不稍延緩、特殊對於不承認愧儡國問題、中國之態度、堅决不變、中國自己不特保持此不承認之原則、且以爲凡在國聯之諸國、及曾同意於此原則之其他各國、皆有擁護之責任今某遠國雖屬含糊、而確已正式承認中國東北之非法組織、其實該國本身與東亞事務、罕有任何直接接觸、承認之情勢、如余所曾言、仍屬含糊、就中國爲國聯一分子之立塲而言、視此行動、實背國聯盟約、實爲國聯所當研究與懲戒之事件、且信無其他國聯會員國將以同樣行爲漢視國際公道、違反一致的報告書中之决議條文、與報告書中所列自己的莊嚴義務、此孤獨之事件、固不足介意、然在理論上、殊屬嚴重、國聯之裁判、曾保持其不可侵犯、以對付乘機引誘破壞之行動、此實甚偉大之事蹟吾儕中國人、非不知有人對於維持此不可侵犯性、到處努力鼓起若干含糊與游移、若　近日作不斷的企圖、揚言對彼不承認中國該部分非法制度者　施行經濟整治、及與彼等駐滿之領事爲難、以恫嚇受大會報告書約束之諸國、更圖以特别經濟利益誘引彼等屈服、關於此節、事有可追述者、大會報告書不特使各國負有在事實上或法律上予以承認之義務、且不得稍　足以便利目前非法制度的維持之行動、大會顧問委員會於解釋此項義務時、曾聲明各國政府對向非法制度主持者掌握中覓求讓與權之國人、不能予以保護、蓋此　非法制度處置中國國有之產業、在國際法上實</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>犯大逆不道之罪、凡根據此種利用時機的行爲之要求、顯然不能爲中國或受大會報告書約束之任何國所承認、凡享有會在滿洲破壞條約之當道所給予之讓與權者、中國政府得在受大會報告書約束之任何國法庭對之起訴、要求賠償損失、此亦爲顯明之事實也、</p>
<p>第二點、余願奉告者、國聯對於此事、有　續性之責任、此項責任、隨遠東局勢緊張與遠東和平隱患之增長而逐漸加重、任何國之拒絶參加日內瓦會議、對此不發生影響、蓋國聯盟約載明任何國非至其所負國際義務完全履行後、不能終止爲國聯會員也、此非無關重要之規定、實爲扼要與基本的義務、如任何國能隨意破壞盟約而逃避其退出國聯之第梨、則國聯之爲和平工具、將成一斷葦矣、大會曾切實宣布今日之武力佔據滿洲、實屬違反國聯盟約·九國公約·及巴黎非戰公約·之行爲、大會爲國聯榮譽之保衛人、責　就余頃所引述其自己之宣言與盟約之規定下一明白的結論、</p>
<p>第三點、余願前請諸君注意者、最關重要、即繼續在遠東作破壞條約之侵略、其後果現已殃及全世界是、大會報告書之詆責此種侵略並判定其責也、曾聲明滿洲目前制度之賡續、實與遠東和平之維持相牴觸、李頓報告書中亦聲明凡未得滿洲人民願意合作之制度、不能恢復中國該部分之秩序與繁榮、並稱、滿洲人民現堅决反對理當目爲用期詐與侵略所創設之外國軍人狄克推多制、事實已不幸證明大會對於佔據吾國東北省所造成之時局、取此見解之如何正當、泊乎今日、局勢毫無進步、且反去國聯前所盼望及對此所决定者更見遙遠、本年三月間、彼非法組織竟實行宣布其爲一帝國、其傀儡並僭自稱帝、雖此傀儡國之性質與地位、不因此而有所更變但爭案之非法性、已具更可危之程度矣、（未完）</p>
<h3>吉東義軍與日僞軍之激戰</h3>
<p>日僞軍組織聯合隊進攻</p>
<p>義軍分區抗敵鏖戰甚烈</p>
<p>長春通訊、日軍强佔我東北以來、我東北民衆雖在重要壓迫下、固無時無刻不在努力反抗中、失敗犧牲、其氣不餒、故前仆後繼、不屈不撓、尤以今歲情形、最爲激昻、蓋日軍建設之公路網雖大部告成、朝發夕至、而東北民衆、仍於艱難中作困獸之鬥、打破日人所謂「滿洲治安、已入安全時期、軍事行動、已告段落、」之僞宣傳以顯示我中華民族之奮鬥精神、然基此故、日軍乃晝夜不安、且認爲事態重大、而有大舉動員應付之行動、除遼寗東邊道一帶、以日軍獨立第一守備隊爲基幹、聯合僞軍、由守備隊司令官三毛指揮、開始攻擊外、近復以駐哈日軍若山師團（第三師團）爲主力、抽調駐熱河日軍第七師團谷旅團·及齊齊哈爾第十六師團篠原·小芝·兩聯隊、與「奉天」僞靖安遊擊隊第一軍全部、組成日僞軍聯合隊、與防區駐屯中之日僞軍相應、包圍吉林省東北部義軍活動區域、分配地區、開始攻擊、我吉林東北各部義軍得訊、均士氣激昻、誓與日僞軍拚殺一塲、連日已經接觸、茲將日僞軍配備與其攻擊義軍情形、探錄如次、</p>
<p>（一）濱江地區、日軍第三師團所屬之三迴·安井·兩聯隊、向義軍精銳部隊于海雲（九江）趙尙志兩部、取大包圍形勢、向陽山·（拉濱綫五常縣東方十五粁）帽兒山·（沿哈綏綫）黑龍宮·賓綫東南）同賓·（延壽）等地區內、發生激戰、</p>
<p>（二）寗安地區、日軍以駐熱河第七師團所屬之谷旅團部下各聯隊爲主力、向寗安地區各部義軍攻擊、已與陳東山部連系部隊愛民九標西部於南湖頭（鏡波湖）發生激戰、</p>
<p>（三）東部地區、日軍以第三·第七·第十六·等師團、抽調精銳之齋籐·吉木·南樾·三聯隊、（合組一旅團以上之兵力）分擔三路、各取一面、向實力雄厚隣近俄邊之義軍孔憲榮部進攻、其戰略上計劃、以包團隊形、採取陸空軍聯合威脅方策、壓迫孔部、但孔部實力甚厚、械彈亦有相當來源、當能持久、</p>
<p>（四）北部地區、日軍於依蘭·方正·佳木斯·等地以田村聯隊·阿文津支隊·小芝支隊·（均大隊階級）聯合組織向義軍謝文東部攻擊、已於長發屯·半截河·太平溝等處、猛烈接仗、日軍少尉梶尾·松田·二人、已被擊斃、</p>
<p>查義軍在吉林東北部活動甚力、而日僞軍所以難應付者、原因有三、（一）隣近邊境、義軍槍彈易於補充、卽至彈盡援絶、亦有來源、（二）當地民衆、受繳槍照地照之刺激、至爲深刻、確知日人之兇殘面目、故有决心抗日及暗助抗日武力、（三）吉林東北部靠近山林地帶、多係大規模之淤泥甸子、此種地方、祇有熟悉悉該地情形之土著、能以靈巧之技術、通行無阻、故日人視爲畏途、至汽車等之運輸更不可能、有此三因、故義軍得以作持久戰也、（東北社）</p>

<p>王吳演詞開會後、首由王正廷致介紹詞、略謂中英關係極爲密切英國雖離東方甚遠、但在太平洋方面、擁有殖民地甚多、故關係頗深、此次賈公使對中英庚欵、分配極佳、使中國諸如航運敎育、鐵路各方面、均能得到實際之帮助、繼由吳氏致歡迎詞云、今晨賈英使蒞臨、非常感謝、此次英使南行視察歸來、中國人民對英使有更深切之信仰、此種信仰、卽希望中英雙方、在賈氏努力之下、獲得更密切之友誼、英使近視察中國各地、對中國各地之努力建設、已有洞悉之認識、至上海方面之建設工作、現僅爲全國中之一小部份、將來全國建設事業、中國政府正力謀積極發展云、</p>
<p>英使演詞本人來華不久、所見亦不廣、對於中華情形、亦未能有深刻之認識、今日所能言及者、僅本個人平素所知、略予貢獻而已、本人初抵華時、遠東時局已趨穩定、本人深信今後能以日趨和平、中國對外外交、今年尙未至嚴重地步、中國內部、現已呈相當安靜、中國政府、在此安靜期中、得能充分注意國內之充實與建設、惟欲臻中國於强盛之地位、當須有長時期之努力、而中國在此時期中所應特别注意者、卽如何與國際謀互相之合作、蓋任何國家、决不能脫離國際關係、而能逹於繁盛之境者、至於中國內部、更有與國際合作之需要、因中國非先對內團結、不足以言向外發展、此點亦並非以國家觀念爲出發點、此種合作、需每一份子、均能以個人之實力、貢獻於國家、以求整個國家之健全、中國唯一之救藥、非在專事抄襲外人、應以固有之精神、擷取外人之長、以補我方之短、中國需要與國際合作之意義卽在此、余信任何國家、均必樂願予接受、現世界不景氣已將告終、英國國內經濟、雖經國內人民之努力而趨穩定、但今後英國之發展、亦非英國單獨所能逹到、同樣需要其他各國之合作、以期獲得共存共榮之目的云、</p>
<p>關於工人捐、日前已由總工會召集各工會、决定工人捐普捐辦法、昨日呈請市政府通令各工廠、定本月十日爲工人捐運動、論工者扣工資一天、論件者扣洋五角爲募捐、聞市政府已令社會局、速令飭遵辦、並登報通告、總工會及各工會正在擴大宣傳公告矣</p>

<h3>港務署疏濬黃浦江新水道</h3>
<p>位置在高橋及張華浜附近</p>
<p>濬寬三百呎縱度五千餘呎</p>
<p>昨日起設置標識船隻二艘</p>
<p>江海關港務署、自本月一日起、重行將黃浦江新水道區域、濬寬三百英呎、以利往來輪舶、並自今日起、在該處設置標識船兩雙、用以指浦西方面落潮時之深淺尺度、大通社記者茲探誌各情於后、</p>
<p>新水道沿革大通社記者昨晨向海關探悉、該項新水道區域、在高橋沙對面、附近於張華浜之間、該處流域、新闢尙僅十餘年、因以前浦江該處水流、尙在新水道之東面、嗣經港務署之測量、認舊流域之窒碍航行及水利、乃由濬浦局、經長時間之疏濬而成、惟現當進出口船舶日繁、故港務署認有繼續將該浦江新水道濬寬之必要、</p>
<p>查得利監工至此次疏濬闊度爲三百呎、縱度約五千六百呎、已由濬浦總局海龍第二號挖泥船、自本月一日起、開始疏濬工作、連日並由濬浦局查總工程師、會同測量濬工人員、監督工作、至海龍第二號挖泥船、尙屬新式、每小時挖泥量約在五六百噸之間、惟當工作時、因須避讓往來船舶、至疏濬時間、不無相當影響、故其究需時若干、可以將該工程告竣、現尙未能估算</p>
<p>輪舶之注意至疏濬時期內、其經過該處輪舶、均須靠浦西方面徐徐行駛、如其駛近挖泥船時、則須拉長聲、俾挖泥船有充分時間、得將其側面錨索放鬆、免致意外、至關各信號、則悉照海關通常停泊信號及燈光、遵循辦理、</p>
<p>設置新標識港務署長谷利恩、茲爲在該處設置標識船隻、特又出貼布告略云、「關於定期實行疏濬浦江新水道一事、茲爲明日指定通航水道之界限起見、特於本年十二月七日起、在該處設置標識船隻兩艘、此項船隻、係用以指明浦西方面落潮時、浦江十八英尺之等深綫、一艘泊於挖泥船之下游、約離船一千五百英尺、另一艘則泊於挖泥船之上游、亦離船一千五百英尺、每艘標識、桅頂上、日間均懸上海浚浦局旗一面、夜間則懸白燈兩盞、上下相隔約六英尺、此項燈光、於晴爽天氣時、在四圍地平綫上、至少一英里以內、均可見及」云云、</p>

<p>我在北平、碰見胡適博士、他說中國需要社會改良、并且他說、「中國幾處仍舊存在着纒足兩惡習慣」、走起路來扭扭　嬝、這種惡習慣、不但使他們的受了束縛、他們思想也受了束縛、日本女人走路很自由、全世界的女人、走路也很自由、爲什麽中國女人走路這樣受束縛呢、從政治上·智識上·道德上·經濟上·社會上·看來、中國急需要有新的人、新的方法來領導民衆現在我有一個問題要提出來、我們是新的領袖嗎、我們是否健全、我們能救中國嗎若是不能够、有什麽緣故、讓我舉幾個例子來說、我到了天津、看見日本租界裏的店裏、都出賣海洛因·嗎啡·這一類的毒藥來麻醉華北的人民并且到　看見鴉片槍人民都吃上了鴉片豆　烏烟瘴氣的景象、迷濛了整個華北這裏有一張十一歲的照片、他也是吃了日本人的毒藥而死的、這裏還有一張五百個鴉片鬼的照片、也是受了日本人的毒、但是比這個毒還厲害的、就是中國人自己種鴉片烟、我在四川、隨時隨地都可以買鴉片烟、像買麫包這樣、一包一包的賣出去什麽人都可以買、甚至小孩也可以去買、像這樣的中國、我們怎樣的挽救呢還有一樁事情比日本人流毒華北還要可惡十倍的、就是揩油、揩油能使軍隊隳滅、政府腐化、商業失敗、我曾在河南、看見有一個產煤區域、每年的產量亦甚豐富、最初這礦是外國人開辦的的、辦事的人不過幾十個、賺錢亦非常的多、後來中國人接收回來經營、用了六百個人來辦事、這六百個人都是他們的親戚朋友、都抱揩油主義、本來每年可以賺到十三萬元但是到了年終結算、反虧去了二百萬元、不久快要破產、後來把蔣委員長知道、就派人去改組、同時裁去了六百個辦事人員、重行整頓、到了第二年終結算、就賺回　百三十萬元、中國向來有絲·茶葉·　大宗出口物、現在中國出口的絲·茶·在那裏、中國向來有茶葉出口、但是現在牠的市塲、都被印度·日本·錫蘭·所奪去了、有一個省份、政府撥二十萬元到二十五萬元去救濟農村、這個欵項、分五部分耗費、但是四分的錢、用給人民、其餘的一分、　進了他們的私囊、買的農具　不好、農民一點兒得不到好處、這樣還算救濟農村嗎、這種揩油的行爲、是刦掠國家的命脉、熱河有一個　　、是一個很肥胖的將軍所管轄的、他有很多的車隊、有許多的妻妾、但是、百四十八個日本兵就把他趕跑這　揩油制度的不改變、中國永遠没有希望的、三十年以前、我在北方演講、有許多的學生、聽我的演講、聽到要革命的時候、大家就大大的鼓掌、然而因爲他們不誠實、自己做了官、比前清的官吏還要貪污、現在我來問你是誠實嗎、你是清潔嗎、我舉出兩個例、一個是誠實、一個是不誠實、這個實誠的人就是華盛頓在美國的歷史上做出許多偉大的事業、還有一個不誠實的、就是　前在北平、有一個很聰明的學生、他自以爲能救中國、他會演說、常常拿三民主義來做口號、後來做了官、賺到五百元一月、此後政府又派他出洋、他住了很貴族化的旅館、開了許多謊　、後來被政府知道了、結果將也撤職、他因此失業、流落到上海來做　匪、不誠實的結果這樣的、諸位、中國人是一般散沙、只知自私自利、只知揩油、這樣的不誠實、還能救中國嗎、這樣永遠醉死夢死、國家還能救嗎、你是誠實嗎、你的思想純潔嗎、你能救國嗎、我們大家都知道散沙是不相和合的、我們要用水門汀將他凝結起來、難道我們有理性的人類、反到不能團結起來嗎、我們要像石頭一樣的堅硬、用內心和外表工夫來救中國、來應付目前中國和平世界的重大危機、（完）</p>

<h3>蘇省職敎報告</h3>
<p>江蘇省敎育廳職業敎育槪况報告書如下、</p>
<p>江蘇辦理職業敎育不自今日始、約言之、已有二十年之歷史、當其極盛時、全省甲乙種實業學校已有二百七十餘所之多、而附設之職業敎育、尙不在內、至於關於職敎之推行與研究方面、亦曾有相當之努力、如設置職業敎育指導員舉行乙種實業學校校長會議、以及組織全省職校聯合會等、均爲其努力之表現、衡情度理、江蘇職敎之前途、當甚可樂觀、然至民國十六年學校改組、小學一律改爲普通小學、乙種實業學校因以不存、而中學師範之合併影響及於甲種實業學校、其能獨存者、僅蘇農淮農　蠶水產四校、以及中學兩職科而已、顧一詰甚結果所以至此之用、則過去職業敎育辦理之不善、實在以致之分析言之、則有四點、（一）由於課程太普通化、過去職業學校之講程、往往偏於普通學科、且不呈視技能訓練、致使其畢業學生、論科學常辯則不如普通中學學生之普徧、論職業技能則不若農夫工人之切用、有名無實、比比皆是、（二）由於無適當工農塲所之設備、過去農工職校雖亦附有農塲工塲、然非塲地過小、即設備不完、偶供學生實騐之用、其實騐工作之成績、最優異者亦不過如普通中學之科學實騐室、可供敎師講解之資而已、（三）由於不重視操作農工塲所設備之缺乏、旣如上述而職校敎師亦多囿於舊習、口能講而手不能做、農工塲所之基本實習工作、多由學校雇用農工夫役、實地操作、學生實習不過去農工塲所帮助農夫工人學學榜樣、敎師口講指書、亦多立於旁觀監視之地位、農工塲所基本生產技能之訓練、師生但屬缺乏、（四）由於學校不與職業界切取聯絡、過去職校專以敎書爲事、少與同性質之企業界切取聯絡、故學校訓練學生之技能、與職業界實地所需要不相銜接、因之畢業學生之出路、亦感學異常困難、因此種種、故蘇省過去職業敎育、雖曾開動一時、卒以其成效不著、關於社會之信用不立、　日特移墊異、遂至一落千丈、殆亦事有必至理有固然者、</p>
<p>二十年春、敎育部鑒於近年來普通中學異常澎漲之結果、中學畢業之人數急增、而其中能升學者僅屬少數、其不能升學者、又無相當生產技能之訓練、不能從事相當之職業、以營獨立之生活、如不亟謀救濟、實爲社會國家之隱憂、於是鈞部有第五三六號訓令限制設立普通中學增設職業學校在普通中學中添設職業科或職業科目縣立　中應附設或改設鄉村師範及職業科及第一四三六號訓令頒發各省市設置中等農工學校實施方案、敎廳奉令之後、當即審察蘇省中等敎育實在情形、積極遵照辦理、嗣二十　年九月奉到第一九七三六號訓令、頒發各省市中等學校設置及經費支配標凖辦法、查蘇省中等敎育、自十六年學校改組、職業學校數量銳减、近年來始復逐漸增加、期於二十六年度逹到鈞部規定標凖、然究竟能否按照預定計劃完全實現、尙未敢懸斷、茲就近數年來省立職業學校推進之情形、用數字報告如下、十九年度在職校四所中學職科二所、其情形與十六年相同、計分九科三十七學級經常費爲二三八·八○二元、佔中等敎育經常費總額百分之一三·六一、至二十年度有職校五所、中學職科四所、計分十一科四十二學級經常費爲一九·七九　元、佔總額百分之一五·六五、較之十九年度增加百分之二·○五、計五一九九○元至二十一年度有職校六所、中學職科四所、計分上三科四十學級、經常費爲三三二·四三五元、佔總額百分之一七·二一、較之五年度增百分之一·五六、計四一六四三元、至二十二年度有職校六所、又公立一所、中學職科四所、計分十四科五十一學校、經常費爲四一一、八四一元、佔總額百分之一九、二三較定廿一年度增加百分之一·○一、計七五四○六元、至二十三年度有職校九所、中學職科三所、計分十七科五十四學級、經常費用五五一·六二四元、佔總額百分之二五·三一、較之廿二年度增加百分之六·○八計一三九·七八三元、歷年來臨時費支配數目尙不計算在內、此專管省立職校年來推進情形言者、更就縣立及私立職校情形言之、蘇省縣立中等學校經費情形、較爲複雜、且各縣類多有　特殊之歷史、如必按照部頒中等學校經費支配標凖辦理、勢必困難甚多、因蘇省各縣敎育經費預算、向分爲行政費、普通敎育費、義務敎育費及社會敎育費等項、高級小學及普通中學職業學校經費、屬於普通敎育經費、初級小學及師範敎育經費、屬於義務敎育經費、爲防止侵佔起見、各項經費、俱不得任意挪用、倘欲推翻成例、重行支配、而勢必發生困難、加以各縣中等敎育經費有限、一縣之內、能兼辦中學師範　職業三種學校者、殊不多見、故關於經費支配、無論如何、難於適合部頒之標凖、因於無　辦法之中、想出一補救辦法、即限制各縣立及私立中學不得任意擴充、提倡各級職業學校、積極推廣、曾經擬定具體辦法、通令各縣、一各縣立中學原辦單軌者、不得藉口升學人數衆多、擴充學級、原辦單軌者、自二十三度起逐年减招、至二十六年止一律改爲單軌（二）各縣已辦有職業學校者、應設法擴充、未辦者應即籌設、其經費即以縮减之中學或新增經費抵充、萬一爲經費所限、亦應籌設職業補習學校、爲不能升學之學生訓練生產技能（三）已立案之私立中學其在普通中學設置較多之地、應督飭勸導减少普通學級、逐漸改辦職業學校或職業補習學校、（四）自　　年度起、私人籌設中學、應即督飭勸導改辦職業學校或職業補習學校、如或經費不甚富裕、逕即勸導改辦小學、以示限制、通令以來、頗見成效、計十九年度祗有縣立職業學校三所、私立職業學校四所、至　十三年度、而縣立職校已增至十一校、私立職校已增至十四所、此由江蘇省敎育廳近年來遵照部頒訓令對於各縣職業敎育推進之槪况也、</p>
<p>以上就職業學校量之增加而言、再就其質的改進言之、吾人旣已見及過去職敎失敗原因之所在、則此次辦理、不　　第二次試騐、從消極方面言之、對於已往種種之不幸、應如何設法避免不使之再見、而從積極方面言之、則應如何籌謀盡善、另闢新徑、以獲得更佳之結果、吾人職責所在、固不容不時時念茲在茲也、茲就三年來實施之改進計劃、擇要述其一二、以見平時注意改進之一班、照依此種計劃、尙有繼續推行者也、</p>
<p>甲、關於農校方面、（一）注意職業目標、修正課程標凖、使課程之重心、在於職業之訓練、而不在於升學之陶冶、爲欲逹到此目的、採取集中基本、科之訓練以增加專學需要之知識、加重技能實習之分量、以引起學生農作之興趣、（二）注重農產製造分期充實農產加工設備、（三）注　推廣合作事業、以　謀學校與農村生活打成一片、</p>
<p>乙、關於蠶校方面、（一）改良製種繅絲、兼程並進、同時推廣其　騐所獲之結果、於蠶絲界、使學校與蠶絲界打成一片、（二）將該校舊貸廠家債欵全數、一次償清、以謀學校與廠家信用之增進、</p>
<p>丙、關於農蠶研究及試騐機關方面、擬聯合首都與本省境內各著名大學之農學院、指導所試騐塲以及　屬各農蠶學校、組織、農蠶研究機關分門别類、從事研究試騐及指導關於農塲各項改進事宜、</p>
<p>丁、關於水產學校方面、（一）添置一切應用儀器、以增進敎育之效能、（二）於可能範圍設法　置拖網進輪、使學生得充分漁業實習之利益、（三）　飭學校充分利用學校內制罐及見扣工廠設備、務使實習效率與實習收入、日有增加、（四）獎勵學校繼續努力與學漁業界切取聯絡、</p>
<p>戊、關於工校方面（一）繼續完成各工校工塲之設備、以增加各該校敎學及實習效率、　積極設法注重學校工塲生產、務使製造成本减少、出貨標凖增　、工塲本身事業、因之日益發展、職工方面、亦定有提成獎勵辦法、以符合營業經濟之原則、（三）學生在工塲實習、完全與普通工人無異、非絶對服從技師命令、不得入塲工作、</p>
<p>己、關於商校方面、採集中充實辦法、省校高中商科、責成省立上海中學辦理、且積極充實設備、如實習銀行基金之儲存、小規模資產消費合作之實際經營商品陳列室之設備皆按照實際需要分别緩急次第舉辦、</p>
<p>至最近於十一月間、召集全省省立職業學校校長會議、關於畢業生之出路問題、學科敎材問題、實習分量問題、以及　科與同科之企業機關聯絡問題等等、均分别詳加討論擬具方案、以備採用、此皆有關於職業敎育質的改進者、</p>
<p>是敎育爲國家整個問題、職業敎育亦自不能例外、且就職業敎育之本質言之、要以農工商業發展、範圍爲立塲、就一省而論、則非　民財敎建四項事業眞實打成一片共爲進行之籌劃、不能臻於完善之域、目前江蘇省雖尙無其他一廳與敎廳聯合辦理職業敎育條例之頒布、然實則已具有民財敎建四種事業無形聯合之趨勢、例證甚多、如前實廳將織物整理機件撥充蘇州工校染織工廠、部分之甲、建廳亦曾劃若干農塲、由敎廳令飭所在地之縣敎育局擬具整理計劃負責辦理之、土地局辦理清丈事業、蘇州工校爲之訓練人材、借用儀器、彼此聯絡之情、與日俱深、財建兩廳近日與辦農業合作人材訓練塲會商敎廳　飭蘇州淮陰兩學校選送　業學生等等皆彰　在人耳日、此種聯合之精神、正與日俱進、實爲江蘇職業敎育前途之曙光、吾人所可引爲欣慰者、　蘇省辦理職業　者鑒於過去歷中異常審愼所有年來推進計劃、或因遵照前頒法令或由地方特殊情形、對於最近部令督促各省市推進職業敎育辦法容有未能　符之處、仍乞鈞部　予鑒原除　　意見另具提案外、與合據實報告　否有當敬乞鑒核、江蘇省敎育廳職敎主管科長向紹軒、</p>

<h3>勞展調查記</h3>
<p>敎育部舉行之廿三年全國職業學校　中小學勞作科成績品、覽會業於本月一日開幕、其中籌備、連日各界參觀情形、已分誌各報、茲經記者詳細調查並與各辦事人員接洽、所得材料、堪作統系之記載、因亟錄出、以嚮記者、諒以先覩爲快也、</p>
<h3>（一）籌備情形</h3>
<p>該會原訂於十月十日舉行、於七月中已派定籌備委員唐惜分·顧兆麐·周邦道·戴應親·鍾道贊等五人、專司其事、旋以借用勵志社·青年會·中人體育塲·華僑招待　等處均未成功、而朝大宮又　爛不堪、無　修理、時難覓適當塲所、幾全停頓、最後乃調查出考試院考塲　十一月中旬可以騰出、及交通部新屋業已完工可以借用該部舊址權作會塲即由籌備員分頭交涉、最後經戴院長季陶先生特　通　、始决定用考試院考塲　考塲建業、壯麗細緻、窗　地板、必須設法　護免　損毀、是時籌備委員已續派至十六人、並指定常委五人、主持大體、於是經多次討論結果、咸認爲必須安投地蓆、及順沿室內外緣陳列、方不至損壞地板及毀傷門窗否　以數萬參觀民衆、逐日行走　擠於內部、實難保其無破裂之虞也、該會常委對　　嚴考塲頗盡心力、因是耗費　保護建築之經費竟逹兩千元之數、此於公物不　謂不重視、</p>
<p>該會最困難之問題、除會塲地址外、即爲陳列成績品之櫉架、因一律定製不但經費不定、且不爲時間所許、蓋過於簡略、則不美觀、欲　整齊、則消費過重、乃將職　覽會新製之鋼質櫉架八十三件、全部借用、事前由平津運京、一切運費均由鐵道部　　義務、會內僅出輪渡費一百五十六元有　、安裝並由鐵道部派工擔任、頗稱便利、此外由會定製梯形本架一百八十個、圖片持架八十個、木板架三百個、木板若干方、共支經費一千三四百元、大會閉幕後、梯形架　作爲小商、陳列商品及居家陳設盆花之用、掛架可改作書架、均不至毫無用途、設計頗費心力、陳列一事、由該會先將各式櫉架安設齊全、再請各省代表會同各館陳列委員共同陳列各館同時工作一時需要臨時小工甚多、塲內頓形　　、其陳列次、按　敎育部規定、首爲職業、次爲中學、再次　小學因成績品式樣結構甚繁、分類頗有困難、自十一月十三日起開始陳列、至　十八日止、凡五日各館一齊佈置完畢、連日各省代表及陳列委員努力工作、其見與極異常豐厚中間且經增加夜工兩次、趕辦居然完竣、其工作緊張可知、最後二十九·三十兩日由全體籌備委員會同各省代表共同檢閱、從新整理　次、陳列工作乃告完畢、該部部次長且親自出馬在塲內審察一週、足徵該部對於此會、異常重視、</p>
<h3>（二）經費情形</h3>
<p>該會槪算、定於會址未决定以前、其總數爲一萬一千　百餘　均係節省　支、乃能敷用、迨至會址决定後、一則憑空增多用於保護考塲　築之費約　千元、二則爲愼重佈置力　整齊之費約多用四五百元三則因借用考塲至少須付水電半費約三四百元、二項約在三千元左右、此外如增設無綫電收音機、定製徽　等項亦略有增加、各館因特殊陳列品定做之木架亦佔一部分、因此又消耗數百元經費該會會期原定爲十日、現經延期二日、並評判二日共　四日經費上亦須增多開支、凡此種種均爲原槪算所無、而該會委員爲遵奉功令起見、正方圖緊　、以期不致十分超過大致會塲佈置、業已完成、此後大宗經費惟善後、薪工·印刷·整理各項較爲鉅數記者連日路逢該會常委、頗有由敎育部步行來往考試院者其撙節情形可見一斑、</p>
<h3>（三）組織情形</h3>
<p>該會組織爲籌備員會、由部長指定五人爲常務委員、其下分設陳列佈置及評判兩委員會·與總務·編輯兩組各設主任一人、陳列佈置委員會主任爲督學唐　分評判委員會主任爲司顧樹森總務組主任爲督學顧兆麐、編輯組主任爲督學周邦道組之下設股、有股長幹事若干人、多由部員兼任、外　者居少數、陳列委員則由籌備委員分任各自代表及其他部員均兼任幹事評判委員會委員係　請敎育界及工商界專家　任、已內定十餘人、現正徵求同意中、總務組設有總幹事及　務、會計招待一股股長在開會期內、各省代表兼任招待事宜餘由部員輪値每館各　人、開　期間、會塲內設總指揮二人、由郝更生担任統率塲內執事人員及童子軍維持全塲秩序、自開幕以來、　　情形不同、除常委全體每日到會外、所有籌備委員及辦事人員、均輪述前往照料、故能遇有特殊情事發生、隨時設法救濟、據該會　務主任顧兆麐云、一二日上午門外秩序欠佳、發劵人員應付容有不得法之處、現已加派人員竭力糾正、惟會內工作人員多係兼任不敷分配、又限於經費不能增設員額不周之處、除設法矯正外、尙祈各界多加原諒是幸」等語、言時頗表慨歎之狀、足見辦事不無困難、</p>
<h3>（四）會塲情形</h3>
<p>會塲佈置、大體尙屬整齊、惟第二館第四館有轉折　走路太狹觀衆易於擁擠、連日各界人士批評亦多言及此點應該會負責人云、一塲內佈置原定四英尺走路、足容三人通行、後因塲地狹小、而各省送來成績品過多、不便削足逍履、於是一再增加木架以致走路稍窄、實屬萬不得已之事、然如此陳列、僅及原送成績品四分之三、尙有四分之一無法容納、若加寬走路利便行人評判何所根據」、</p>
<p>連日觀衆雖甚擁擠、塲內秩序尙可勉强維持、惟二日上午有一婦女在第　館塲內暈倒、經童子軍救護出塲、又有一幼童在　四館壇上墜落木架之下、經湖北代表扶抱乃起、又有一執事人失落便　經工役拾得發還、又有青島市失去乎　一付、江蘇省失去坐鐘一個、其時尙　損失、此外塲內灰塵太多、確爲缺點、據該會管理人員云、「塲內每日閉門後掃除一次、有時且加夜工一日夜間直至深更、四時始行完竣整理不可謂不周、但「到上午上時後、塵灰又起考其原因、係觀衆鞋下浮塵飛起、殊難防制、現在窗門已不能關、惟有隨時開關墻上電扇以資調劑、現正設想種種方法便利觀衆」云、</p>
<h3>蔣委員長資助察省職敎推行</h3>
<p>撥十萬元充職校畜牧科及造林等之用</p>
<p>察哈爾敎育廳科長王繼儒出席敎部召集之全國職業敎育討論會、頃與晤談、據云、蔣委員長此次視察該省後已慨然由南昌行營年撥十萬元、（現已撥到五萬）以三萬爲造林經費、兩萬辦職業學校畜牧科一萬補助學校軍訓、四萬爲推進口外民衆敎育之用、現在該省敎廳、已於職校開辦畜牧科、明年仍推廣學級對於義務敎育之推行、先辦聯立鄉村師範、造就師資並加授蒙古語文、以便於推進口外小學關於盟旗子學之用、推行民衆敎育辦法、而組織汽車巡廻演講團備汽車數輛、分講演·衛生·美術·敎育·電影·四部、每月以二十日　出發分赴口外各地之巡廻演講期、如此推行民衆敎育、亦别開生面之一法、並聞該省敎廳代表、已商經敎部介紹業經自製敎育影片之省市、（如江蘇等）租借　多敎育影片、凖備於職敎討論會畢、帶往察省應用云、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第五回　謟笑逢迎挑燈照憔悴飢腸驅迫敷粉學風流</p>
<p>好在桌上放有地壺茶，倒出來，兩個人足足的一喝。這才見小紀笑嘻嘻的　了許多東西進來，放在桌上看時，臉盆，手巾，鏡子，胰子盒，雪花膏，粉匣，胭脂膏全有了。他向胡嫂子道：你替他打扮罷。說畢，跑出去，提了一壺熱水進來。再跑出去，又捧了一個衣服包進來。他見月英還是正正端端的坐在這裏，就正了臉色道：小姑娘，爲什麽不動手？你要知道，這樣跑來跑去，都是爲你呀，並不是我貪圖什麽好處。我要說一句不大通人情的話，假使你有了辦法，何至於我當茶房的人，送你這點子鍋塊，你都吃了呢。月英聽了這話，不由兩臉通紅。胡嫂子道：這話還要你說呀。我們這位姑娘，是有膏子的，只爲昨天餓得難受，實在没有了路子，今天早上才勉强來的。小紀道：却又來，旣然來了，當然是望事情辦成功，洗洗臉，換換衣服，讓人家一見就歡喜，豈不是好。如若嫌我在這裏，有些不好意思，我就走開。那賈老爺可起來了。說不定他早上，就會出門去，你們還是早一點去的好。說着，他替他們帶上了房門，先走了。胡嫂子道：月英，有鏡子在這裏，你自己動手罷。月英皺了眉道：若是那樣，不成了賣風流的人嗎？舅娘，你想，我這樣抛頭露面，已經羞死人，再要打扮了給人去看，我這兩塊臉，向那兒擱？胡嫂子道：誰不是這樣說呢？可是你得想到，今于不是厚了這兩塊臉，這些鍋塊就没有得吃。你還得記着，家裏還有兩個人，不定要餓到什麽時候呢。我們還想小紀那塊錢呵。（八四）</p>
<h3>悼史量才先生</h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>本來，我和史量才先生並無鄉誼戚誼，世誼，學誼，友誼，原不用把我蘊在心　的對於史先生的哀悼，多事的宣佈到　筆上去。但是，史先生這回的被刺的給予我的感想。實在太深了。爲了感想的發抒，就不能不寫此篇文字。</p>
<p>史先生此次的被刺，誠足令人哀悼的，同時又最値得欽敬的，而在另一方面。却又使人覺到感慨無窮；因爲史先生根本可以不致被刺，所以史先生的此次被刺，也可說是自召其禍。然而這一點，便是史先生的過人的偉大呀。</p>
<p>中國人抱的唯一的主義，便是享樂。所以在生活上只要能够超出掙扎和呼號的環境時，他就深居蟄處，閒散舒逸地恣意享受那物質上的快樂；無論國家怎樣的需要他，社會又怎樣的需要他，人羣事業也怎樣的需要他，他總不肯適應需要，走向風塵去肩起職責，而發揮他的本能了，這種主義，在他個人固然是得計的，勝利的，但在國家社會人羣事業諸方面，將要受到何等　的阻碍呢？現在史先生就不然，論他的地位與資財，儘可安居象牙之塔，做個南面王不易的快樂人，而且史先生旣建巨功於前，就是享樂於後，也可對得住國家社會人羣事業了。然而史先生他始終打破個人主義，始終爲大衆服務，千金之子，尙是坐不垂堂，史先生却還不辭勞瘁的僕僕風塵。雖則史先生的被刺，許就爲了他不肯享樂，祇知服務，但是史先生的寗願服務而不辭被刺的精神，就够何等的偉大呀。</p>
<p>最後，我想史先生的被刺，也許是爲在這個社會上像史先生的人太少了的緣故。唉！</p>
<h3>阿孟與綠牡丹</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>綠牡丹，在菊花當中，要算是一種奇葩了；因爲這種菊，花瓣是很闊，朶頭是很大，尤其是顏色，碧沉沉中帶着深青的異彩，而花蕊更顯得綠油油的逼人眉宇，這是他的特色；像城襄呂墅草堂，胡氏古花樓，南里鹽棧，西門外瑞芝義莊，種類果然是很多，而終不及北門縣立初中學校菊花之冠絶一時，就是有了這一盆綠牡丹，竟博得校園藝菊的聲名藉甚呢！</p>
<p>該校種菊，已多歷年所，但扦插灌溉，是托之花匠麽？例也不是，不過委諸校役一人的手中，而獲此成績，那眞不容易的一件事啊！這位校役，校裏都呌他一聲阿孟，新阿孟兩字的名氣，就在校外的人，亦多能認識；因爲他執役是很忠實，從没有一些過失給人指摘，所以他種的菊花，異常富麗，而有聲譽，大家也就歸功於阿孟了；有人說：「阿孟」，可稱他是菊奴，因他年紀，已經五十多歲，牙齒滿口已脫落，校裏的男女學生們，莫不呼他爲老太婆。然而阿孟聽了，常常癟着嘴，說道：老太婆，你！看我種的菊花，不是像十七八歲的青年男子，和摩登小姐麽？』</p>
<p>這回綠牡丹，由某君介紹，曾經參加青陽港的菊展，占了第一席，阿孟自然聽到這個消息，不由得笑逐顏開，快活得很；唉！那裏曉得這一盆綠牡丹在出門的當兒，實在齊齊整整的花。共有十三朶，待到回來的時候，在其他的眼光裏看，不過好像一個學生在運動塲，得到最後優勝，奏凱而回罷了；阿孟是親手種植這盆綠牡丹的，他的心裏，就像自己親生的兒子一樣，他對綠牡丹細細一看，不覺歎了一口氣，說：爲什麽十三朶花，現在祇有十二朶了，幾乎急得要眼淚直流；近來如有人問起綠牡丹，他還齗齗的怪人眞没有公德哩！</p>
<h3>絨衫狗歌</h3>
<p>— 山公</p>
<p>北四川路所見</p>
<p>世間奇事無不有，試看今日絨衫狗，狗何幸運著絨衫，應識追隨主恩厚，摩登女郎中國人，手牽一狗街上走，天寒親爲製寒衣，結絡絨衫費纖乎大衣熨貼披上身，緊束其腰加以紐，當年聞有賜緋猿，狗亦爭先豈甘後，狗今戴恩跳躍狂，或先或後左或右，主人亦復不寂寞，前行得得原回首。嗟哉今年歲事荒，窶人挑擔賣兒郎，聲嘶力竭耐寒餓，狗乃飽餐牛肉厭槄　，有如尋人尋狗登廣告，人價不如狗價昂，可以人而不如狗，欲求其故誰能詳，愛之則欲加諸膝，更被美服爲風光，狗乎狗乎不世遇，好頌爾主休無疆。我聞古人重博愛，仁民愛物有交代，賤人貴畜理何居，天地無庸輕一嘅，嗚呼！世間奇事無不有，試看今日絨衫狗。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （鵑）</p>
<p>距史總理被難之日，忽忽兼旬矣。以公之中正和平，萬無殺身之理，而卒不免於殺身，厥故安在？迄於今莫能明。公之目，其能瞑乎？今日本報同人，舉行追悼會於湖社，吾將携　斛熱淚，揮之　前，魂兮有知，或能於吾人之前，有所啟示乎？嗚呼！上帝無言，哲人何處　撫　　慟，百念灰冷矣。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>離開了第二座宮院，我們便穿到了第三座宮院中來。在這裏隨着進去的人都已各留心檢束，絲毫不敢做出聲音來。因爲這一座宮院中所藏着的遺物，必然會使太后一見之後，立卽非常尖刻地回想起伊自己昔年的一段歷史來。這一段歷史中所包含的事實，無非是艱難，痛苦，恐怖，憂愁，奮鬥，以及許多令人心碎的慘變；無疑地，這是很辛酸的回憶。如其可以避免，我想太后也是决不願時常回憶起來的，然而眼前所陳列的一堆遺物，乃是伊自己的丈夫——咸豐皇帝的遺物，一映入伊的眼簾，便無可避免的勾起了伊的辛酸的憶來。</p>
<p>伊當年初進皇宮的時候是和另外十六位旗籍的少女一起被選進去的，伊們十七個人，一般都是綺年玉貌，長得像花一樣的嬌艶；但咸豐却只愛上了伊一人，不久便正式把伊册立爲妃，寵冠一宮。</p>
<p>關於咸豐的歷史，太后當然是最詳細最清楚的一個；其欠，便要讓李蓮英了；不過在那時候，李蓮英還祇是一個十多歲的小孩子咧，他也未必會有怎樣清楚的認識。至於我們這些人呢，－光緒，隆裕，瑾妃，和我們八個女官。－大槪也各有少許知道，都是簡接從别人那裏聽來的；而其中聽得最多的，又得讓我了！因爲太后和我閒談得比較最多一些，每次閒談，總免不得要追訴一回往事，這睦往事裏頭，便有不少是牽涉咸豐的。（一九四）</p>
<p>游踪所至</p>
<h3>西湖訪秋記</h3>
<p>— 靄生</p>
<p>在報紙的廣告上，發現了西湖蝶來飯店的「訪秋會」，它說：紅葉的美灑。勝於春花，在廣告的句子裏，這種字面是不容易發現的。而且車票，汽車，住，食，游，一應在內，兩天的盤桓。一對伴侶，只銷三十塊錢，眞是多麽便宜而又風雅的事，所以我們也就做了「訪秋會」的一份子。</p>
<p>我們坐的是二等車，車票就是歸蝶來飯店預備，到了杭州城站，就　見「蝶來」的招待，穿了制服在招待，同時還有不少「訪秋會」的會員，都是一對對的，據我們估量去，至少是一對情侶，但是我們不認得。</p>
<p>從車站踏上了蝶來飯店的接客汽車，車身很華麗而寬舒，大小和公共汽車一樣，裏面却裝的沙發。我數了數，連我們恰好是六對，這大槪都是爲訪秋色而來的吧，所以都相視一笑，因爲明天還要同伴去遊覽呢。</p>
<p>蝶來飯店是在西冷橋之北，臨湖面山的一座精緻旅館，並不是貴族式，但狠華麗而幽雅，一帶紅廊彎彎曲曲的通到臥室裏去。外面似乎種着許多花木，還養着畫眉和八哥，因爲天晚了，鳥籠子罩着籠衣，鳥是照例不來歡迎你了。晚上吃的是西餐，很有「麥瑞」風味。</p>
<p>次晨侍者輕輕的叩着門，說：「先生！七點半了。」我連忙坐起來，滿室晶瑩，晒着朝陽，紅廊在窗外面，湖在紅廊外面，山又在湖外面，都和圖畫一樣，一重一重照入我的眼簾，連忙呼醒了伊，洗沐一會就是晨餐了。</p>
<p>原來「訪秋」的人，不止我們同車的六對，還有預先來和臨時加入的，我看那路由，始程是汽車送到四眼井，便想不坐車子，坐船去，旅館裏說：「可以」，我們本來備着船呢。這個「訪秋會」，是絶對自由的，就從柳陰中下了船，直向南湖搖去，晨曦照在水裏，和銀子一樣。</p>
<p>船搖到赤山埠不能再進去了，棄舟而步，一直向石屋洞來，船照例比汽車慢，等我們到石屋洞，訪秋會的人，已來過了。守門外停着兩乘轎子，原來是等我們坐的，我們就不再進寺，坐上轎子，一直向烟霞洞來。一路松陰，　約有幾株栗子樹和銀杏，染着鮮紅和嬌黃的顏色。我心想蝶來飯店的廣告，有些過誇了。誰知一到山下，向南高峰一邊望去，高高下下的樹，没有一株不像喝醉了酒，没有一株不鮮明，秋色如錦，眞非虛語。花廳上，樹陰石桌上，已有許多人在那裏吃喝起來，原來却預備兩個人一桌，誰也不必和誰拘泥，蝶來主人心思之細，設備之週，到了此時，却不得不佩服了。</p>
<p>飯後在山前山後，繞了一週，無非秋色，還有一處在動工，起造一所房子，據說就是蝶來主人設計蓋的名爲「蝶隱園，」因爲此地原有一所「蝶隱園」荒廢久了，現在再補砌的，名稱也就巧合得狠。馬夷初先生已有一付對聯，掛在洞裏，彷彿記得有「東是坡僊西蝶隱」這麽一句話。</p>
<p>從烟霞洞到龍井到理安，都是坐的轎子，沿路秋色，千變萬化，目接不窮，九溪十八澗，已經舖了馬路，汽車一直可以進去了。蝶來的專車已經等久了，我們還在九溪茶塲門前，雪白的茶布上吃了蝶來茶點，這一次却是一張長檯子，挨次兒排了名刺坐的，我們就在席上，互相將名刺交換了。一天的遊覽，恰結識了－六個歡喜山水的朋友，還在蝶來飯店特備的簽名簿上，留了名字和贊美。汽車到徐村，已五點半了，預定的六和塔遊覽，就没有去，怱怱的上了閘口火車，一直向上海進發。</p>
<p>這一種遊覽方法，確是旅行事業中値得注意而稱述的。可是今年的訪秋會，已結束了。　屐重遊，期之來歲。</p>

<h3>通報通話雙用的碼語練習機</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>無綫電廣播波長玩弄得厭倦了，我們應當換換口味，來試騐短波。短波，可作業餘通信，且有超超的特性，試騐時會得非常興趣。我們讀O.S.T.羨慕美國業餘家的活躍，時助國家電信交通所不逮之處；我國幅員遼闊，電信交通猶在襁褓時期，所以很需要許多業餘家起來，在業餘範圍內，爲國家努力。欲成就一個業餘家，首要聽懂碼語，熟練收發，本文卽介紹一具通報通話雙用的碼語練習機，亦適合於業餘家初步的基本練習。</p>
<p>碼語練習機製造甚易，所費無幾，所需零件皆可以在廣播機上所用的來代替。綫路請參看附圖。此機適合於二人實習，故分甲乙兩站，中距任意試騐，而用適當長度的雙絞合導綫連接，如若導綫過長，有靜電干擾，則導綫外須用鉛包管以隔離。如若爲便利起見，採用單綫而接地回路亦可試騐之。圖中T爲成音週率變壓器。Ｖ爲眞空管，最好採用９９或３０號式的，用電較爲經濟。Ｐ爲聽筒Ｒ爲二十歐姆的電流節制器。Ｃ爲固定電容器，量値自.005至.08兆分法拉，過大則音號深而糢糊。ＫＳ爲電鍵與開關。Ａ爲甲電，Ｂ爲乙電，電壓以所需眞空管之特性而定。將應用零件配齊，如圖接綫後，卽可約同志一位試騐。</p>
<p>試騐時若乙站發報員先發報，則甲站開關須閉合；乙站發報員打鍵，甲站報務員卽能收得清晰的碼語音調。甲方待聽完碼語後，卽將開關啟放，打鍵送報，打好後復將開關閉合，靜待乙方回報，可這樣往復練習。</p>
<p>此機又可作通話試騐，通話時甲站開關須先閉合，兩站發話人各將一聽筒講話，一聽筒聽話。惟講時語聲須重，否則聽筒振膜不起振動，對方毫無所聞。所用聽筒，總阻須相等，乃得佳效。</p>
<p>此機作發報試騐時須加注意的，若振盪器不生振盪，查看綫路有否接錯，第二步乃再調換兩方變壓器接綫以試之。</p>
<h3>關於高週率放大器構造的注意各點</h3>
<p>— 利</p>
<p>（Ａ）因高週率所生的電容作用</p>
<p>電容作用是什麽呢？最明顯的一個是電容器，兩片互相接近，有電容量。但是在眞空管中間的棚極及屏極互相對峙，各綫路的並行，都是一個電容器都有電容作用，電容作用發生的阻力呌做電容廻阻（Coondensiue　reactance）。依公式電容廻阻爲周率，Ｃ爲電容量，倘電容量的數一定不變時，電容廻阻的程度是依周率大小而定的。由公式裏看起來Ｃ的數値不變時，f的數値愈大Xc的數値愈小。所以可以證明週率愈高時，電容廻阻愈小，因爲射電周率放大電路上的電流都是高週的，那麽線路內的電容廻阻減小，以致高週率電流的運行，常易超越正軌，那就容易發生種種障碍，如振盪作用等，使收音混亂。所以在搆造放大收音機時，各部所用之連結線，最忌平行和互相緊密的接觸。要將連結綫設法成互爲直角的方向，使電谷作用减到最低的限度。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）變壓器的位置</p>
<p>在變壓器的近傍有磁力綫繞着，如果是鐵心的這磁力綫會依附着鐵心成做磁路，外散的磁力較少。但是空芯的變壓器因爲磁力線没有依傍的東西，所以附近牠的周圍有許多散磁綫Stray　Hux。。在綫圈的兩端尤其厲害。如果有幾個相似的變壓器裝置得互相迫近，互相連接等，都會互相擾亂，以致或起劇烈振盪。或减少效力。我們記好將安置變壓器的周圍，勿和他器緊觸，數個變壓器同裝時，各個須互相成直角，或各個互相平行（每個距離至少在二英過以上）。有人主張變壓器要裝置和地平面成四十度的斜角，不會和地心磁力發生作用。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）眞空管的選擇</p>
<p>各種眞空管都有放大的能力，但是有的眞空管可以檢波及放大兩用，有的是專供放大用的，放大用的管無非是揀用硬性的眞空管（Hard　tube），比較更好。所謂硬性眞空管是玻璃球裏面眞空的程度極高屏極才能够受得比較的高壓的電。</p>
<p>因爲眞空管放大的特性本來甚佳，所以有人主張在放大器上最好單純利用眞空管的放大作用。使用變壓器雖然能够增加放大的能力，但是使用比率大的變壓器不易得良好的成績，因爲眞空管的棚極所受的交流電壓，和牠所受的直流的電壓有一定限制，高比率的變壓器往往使後級的眞空管柵極受交流電壓太高，以致發生變態的電流，及振盪作用壓器，多加眞空管的級數，比較更可以得美滿成績，</p>
<p>（Ｄ）柵電壓的調劑</p>
<p>在放大用的眞空管裏面，放大眞空管常用Ｃ電池的陰電壓加在柵極上。但是各種眞空管各有牠的特性，互有差異，柵極所用的Ｃ電壓不能一槪而論，Ｃ電池的電壓斷不能够這般任意調節，所以用一個分壓器來調節柵電壓比較更便利些。不過分壓器是直連在Ａ組電池的兩極，要用相當的總啟閉器，不用的時候可以截去電流可以免無故的損耗。總觀上面的四種，雖是似乎普通，但是我們在搆造高週放大器的時候，那是不可不注意的。所以上面所述的四種，是高週放大器的搆造的要點。</p>
<h3>一隻靈敏的長短波單管收音機</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>用３３号成音週率放大管做檢波，其靈敏度確較普通３０號眞空管高超。本文所述之長短波一燈收音機，卽用一隻３３號眞空管作回輸式檢波，故其靈敏度確甚優越；曾用普通廣播收音天線收到蘇俄荷蘭及英國等之短波播音，及無數之短波電報，並且音量亦甚大。用其廣播線圈收聽本埠電訊，聽筒中聲響震耳。故爲介紹之。</p>
<p>本機綫路並無特異之處，故構造甚易，但製作時須謹愼從事，以期獲得美滿之效果。機中用一只五萬歐姆之變量阻耗調節３３號眞空管之簾柵電壓以控制回輸力，回輸作用十分平穩。共用插入式線圈四只，以收聽各段波長，其圈數及綫號如下：</p>
<p>波長L1L2L1L2間距離２０公尺４圈６圈１／４英寸６０公尺１８圈１６圈３／１６英寸１００公尺５０圈３０圈３／１６英寸廣播段１５１６英寸５８英寸１／８英寸</p>
<p>以上各綫圈除二十及六十公尺叚之Ｌ１用二十六號雙紗包綫外，其餘均用二十六號漆包綫。</p>
<p>其綫路如附圖，圖中另件均已註明，此處不再重述。各另件均應用上等品，否則影響其績。甲電最佳用小型二十五安培小時之蓄電池，或用二瓶乾電池串接而六六歐姆之變量阻耗降低至二弗打。乙電用四十五弗打已可，最大不可過六十七弗打。面板應用鋁板（此時Ｒ須與面板絶緣）各處接綫預須短直，接頭處均用錫妥銲，以得優良之成績。</p>
<h3>二張改良後的三回路礦石機綫路</h3>
<p>— 蔡日新</p>
<p>三回路是礦石機中最好的一種綫路，這是天家所公認的，的確，它的音量要比普通的單綫回路宏　很多，但是選擇性方面，還不十分優良，這是很可憤的：作者爲了要增加它的選擇性，所以試騐了二個星期，結果有圖一圖二的二個方法。（圖另附）</p>
<p>這二綫路的成績，都是極好，依我試騐後的觀察，圖二比圖一更好，圖一的滤波器没有圖二的效力大。諸位有三回路礦石機而感選擇性不好的不妨一試，ＬＬ１Ｌ２，普通的三回路綫圈亦可。</p>
<p>Ｌ－二十四號綫，在珠網板上繞十二圈。</p>
<p>Ｌ１－二十四號綫，在珠網板上繞五十八圈。</p>
<p>Ｌ２－二十六號綫，在珠網板上繞三十四圈。</p>
<p>Ｌ３－二十六號綫，在一時直徑圓筒上繞五十圈。</p>
<p>Ｌ４－二十六號綫，一隻圓筒上，離７／８吋，繞二十二繞。</p>
<p>Ｌ５－二十六號綫，在一吋直徑圓筒上繞七十圈，每十圈分一頭。</p>
<p>Ｃ－０００３兆分法特可變儲電器。</p>
<p>Ｃ－０００２５兆分法特可變儲電器。</p>
<p>Ｄ－靈敏礦石。</p>
<p>ＬＬ１Ｌ２裝在三廻路綫架上。</p>
<h3>濾波電路</h3>
<p>— 青釗</p>
<p>欲設計一選擇性較優之收音機，則須擇一優良的濾波電路以應付之，方可除却不需要之混音，以增加其選擇性，下圖甲乙丙所示者爲幾種優良的濾波電路。甲圖使LsCs電路與混音波長相配諧，給以低耗阻之通路，使不需要之射電週率流通於此間，而不使流入收音機，如是收音機中之混音則能屏除。乙圖，在收音機之天綫及地綫端之間，接一小綫圈Ls，使LsCs電路與ＬC相交連，使其與所要接收之波長相配諧，則LC受此電路之反作用，結果ＬＣ端之總阻（Impedance），對於所要接收的週率常最大；然對於其他週率，其總阻之値則低下，故可逹屏除混音之目的。丙圖所示者係先使CsLs電路與混音週率相配諧，而LtCt電路與所欲接收之週率相配諧，此因電路過於複雜，非熟練者，調節頗非易易。</p>

<h3>滇越路（上）</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>火车吐出漫長的黑烟，飄在車身後，像一條亂蓬蓬的辮子似的，隨着罡風的吹動，飄散在樹林裏，一會兒消滅不見了。</p>
<p>像走倦了似的，啌啌的喘着氣，從這隻山上竄到那隻山上，老是那末不斷的轆轆的響着，坐在火車裏的人，早給這有節拍的聲音催眠着了。</p>
<p>車窗外盡是巍峨重疊的高山，山上長着黑鬱鬱的樹林，和綠茸茸的茅草。火車終日只是在这闃無人烟荒凉寂寞的山野裏，沿着水勢滔滔的富良江奔跑。有時，鑽到陰森的隧道裏，由龐大的山肚子裏直穿過－這途程不想竟是這末艱苦的。</p>
<p>時候已經到了下午三四點鐘，河口似乎不久就要到了。天忽下起迷濛的細雨來，窗外陰沉沉的，同車的人除了三個從未出過門，正給這景物驚奇着的青年外，便是那一羣（約莫七八個）埋着頭睡熟了，穿着咖啡色的長衣，牙齒染得漆黑，嘴裏嚼着一口鮮紅檳椰的安同婦人，她們大槪是給這悠遠的程途顚簸疲倦了。</p>
<p>因爲語言不通的緣故，我們從没有同她們說過一句話，這些面白唇紅的異邦者，頭上裹着一辮粗大的黑髮，脚上套着一雙走起路來拍撻拍撻的木頭鞋，她們的一舉一動，常時使我們睜大眼睛驚奇的呆視着。尤其是她們那吸烟的樣子：蹲在地板上，背脊靠得牢牢的，擦着火柴，把嘴含着那没有水的烟筒，用勁一吸－過了這末三四分鐘，然後才慢慢的張開嘴把烟吐出，人就像非常之爽快了似的，那樣子眞使我們禁不住好笑！</p>
<p>我們三個年青人，悶沉沉的坐在火車裏，各人低着頭在想着自己的心事，不防，窗外的雨越發下大起來，火車爬在峻峭的山坡上走得很遲慢，肚子不覺餓起來了。</p>
<p>火車走到一個山㘭裏，忽然給一個從山頂上落下來的大石頭，擋住了去路，車頭給擠出軌外去了。幸喜這裏是一個山㘭，没有發生危險－若是走在千餘丈高，路側就是山水奔流着的山谿，那我的天，什麽都完了！</p>
<p>火車出了岔，一時便有許多工人來修理，但那橫臥在車輪下的石頭，是那樣不容易拿出，看這樣子，車是非到明天不能修好開了，然而，在這四無人烟的山㘭裏，我們將怎樣辦呢。</p>
<p>天漸漸的黑了，肚子越發餓得難過起來－我們彼此面對面的望着，焦急得只是苦笑！幸得這時，那幾個同車的安南菩薩，看我們那末狼狽，便慷慨的拿出她們帶在身邊的飯來分給我們吃。</p>
<p>這飯眞是希奇：用樹葉緊包着，好像棕子似的，雖然有點嫌其不衛生，但竟狼吞虎嚼的將牠吃完了。</p>
<p>拿起那篾織的飯盒還給她們時，肚子裏還有幾分不滿足，但一面却笑嘻嘻的靦覥着遞給她們了，心裏是說不出的感激！</p>
<p>已經是黑夜了，大家看看：今夜是只有在車裏睡了，便把車廂的窗門關上，防備着野獸來臨，打開行李，隨便靠着就睡了。</p>
<p>睡到深夜，月光從鐵門縫裏照進來，車裏一片皎潔的光輝，大家以爲天亮了，忙開了鐵門出去看看：山頂上蒙着一層雲也似的白霧，同天上的白雲連接着，月光的清輝照在這白霧上，白皚皚的，美妙得說不出－山上的樹呀，草呀······靜悄悄的浴在月光裏，是這末溫柔，可愛！彷彿已經睡熟了似的。寂靜的空氣裏泛着沁人的幽香，在這寥廓凄清的境地裏只有遠遠的清越的山泉聲，低低的在奏着。令人聽來，不知不覺的竟把旅途中的辛苦忘記了。</p>
<p>可惜這深山中的美妙的夜景，就只有這一夜隨便領略了一下，第二天早晨我們便到老街去了。</p>
<h3>特徵的强調</h3>
<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>特徵的强調，在單是存在於藝術上，而且也存在於自然科學和社會科學上。自然科學家探求得水的主要原素，是氫和氧，進而得知水是由二個氫和一個氧的化合物，於是就以H2O來代表水，然而實際上的水，在這兩種元素之外，還有别的許多雜質。社會科學家研究資本主義社會，求出了主要的特徵和法則：商品，貨幣等等是主要的特徵，恐慌，獨佔，戰爭，崩潰是主要的法則，於是以這些標識，來代表資本制社會；然而現實的資本制社會，還有無限複雜的現象在。我們不能因這種抽象的特徵的强調之故，而非難這些科學法則的非現實。</p>
<p>藝術也是這樣的，但非抽象的特徵的强調而是具體的特徵的强調。誰要呌西曼提斯找出眞的唐，吉訶德先生其人來，那就是傻瓜，因爲唐，吉訶德先生是西曼提斯所具體化了的典型的人物，是經過他一番特徵的强調之勞作而成的。</p>
<p>總之，特徵的强調，不論在科學或藝術上，都是必要的。科學無此，則認識無從集中；藝術無此，就喪失了藝術的感動力。尤其是作品中人物的性格，倘不將其特徵加以强調，那種損失是非常之大的。格萊特訶夫（Gladkov）最近說過這樣的話：「······現代的巨大的形象，指導的典型，要求作家有大的確信······在這際會，某種量理想化，某種性格的特徵之强調，並無恐怕的必要。」「我們注意的焦點，應該是··並非肖像畫的，而且典型的，並非時事性，而是現代性。」</p>
<h3>易卜生的創作方法</h3>
<p>— 王集叢</p>
<p>（上）</p>
<p>梅乃求考夫斯基說：「易卜生是否認了從來一切審美上的形式的藝術家。在作品構成上他是古典主義者：在有很深的詩的情緒上，他是浪漫主義者。但是，我們假使更進一步而精神地研究這位詩人的人格時，或者要確定他在什麽地方是到一個結論，就是他雖則在形式上和柏羅丢司（豫言之神······）一般有種種的樣式，但他的根本性質，决不是自然主義者，也不是古典派，更不是浪漫派。在易卜生的詩中，對於社會的反抗，和哲學的理想主義，論理的地以傳習的社會關係，錯雜地存在着。」如果從作爲偉大的劇作家的易卜生的複雜性的一點上說來，則梅乃裘考夫斯基的這叚話是有很深刻的意義的。但是，倘若我們將其複雜性綜合地觀察，那便可以知道易卜生是怎樣地在創作，知道他是屬於何種的文學的流派。因爲仔細分析起來，每一個偉大作家的創作方法，差不多都是狠複雜的，但規定其創作方法的，却是只有一個東西——他所要表現於其作品中的思想的內容；更進一步說，即是其所處的時代社會。易卜生也是一樣，只要我們能從此點出發，綜合地作總的觀察，則是可以看出其創作方法之主要傾向的。</p>
<p>所謂創作方法，不消說是用來表現一定的事物，一定的思想與感情的。離開了具體的事物，離開了社會思想與感情，任何創作方法也不存在。易卜生所描寫的十九世紀後半挪威的社會現象，他是個極端的個人主義者，他之描寫當時的社會現象，是在個人主義之下對當時的社會表示反抗的。　他的創作方法呢？當然是用來表現其所要表現的社會現象的，是用來表現其個人主義，反抗精神的；換言之，即是從其作品的內容中引出來的。因此，首先在採取題材上，他就不能像歌德之作「浮士德」或雨果之作「歐那尼」一樣，以歷史的故事爲題材來創作，他必須描寫現實的社會現象。他的「愧儡家庭」，「社會棟樑」，「國民公敵」······等作品所表現的，都是可以在當時挪威的社會中找到的現實的故事；他在他的創作中所提出的關於道德，宗敎，法律乃至婦女的問題，都是現實的社會問題：這些都是顯明的例證。其次，易卜生若要以個人主義的武器來反抗現實社會，那他在描寫時便不能遵守什麽律的形式，根據什麽「人性描寫」的原則，像一般古典主義者似的；同時，他也不能像浪漫主義者那樣，玄想現實以外的事情，任隨情感奔放，這樣地來描寫；對於他，必要的乃是生動地描寫那活的現實的社會現象，因爲要這樣，才能顯示出現實的醜惡（如果那現實是醜惡的的話），才能表現出他的反抗精神。——這樣，我們可以說易卜生不是古典主義者，也不是浪漫主義者，而是應該將其婦之於自然主義的旗下的。易卜生本人亦曾在一八八二年說：「我做書的目的，要使讀者人人心中都覺得他所讀的全是事實。」這便是一般自然主義者所持的論調。</p>
<p>（下）</p>
<p>然而，極端的個人主義者易卜生之反抗現實，並没有明確的出路。他只是猛烈地攻擊現實社會的道德法律與宗敎，並未注意到產生它們的那現實社會的基礎，所以，他不能從反抗道德法律走到政治的出口，致使他的一般宣傳貧弱曖昧。這結果，便使得自然主義者易卜生更穿上了象徵主義的衣裳。</p>
<p>所謂象徵主義，乃是在藝術家一方面旣要反抗現實，另一方面又没有明確的思想爲依據的情况下發生的。因爲没有明確的思想，便不會有明確的內容，所有的只是無意識的反抗；其結果當然没有光明的前途，只有「象徵」，只有沉溺於抽象的「唯我主義」的深淵中。易卜生便是這樣的。在他的一切劇作中，都充滿了反抗精神，但結果呢？都是歸結於渺茫的「凈化自己的意志」，甚至將其一切努力付之於天上的嚮往。譬如，「傀儡家庭」中的娜拉的對於法律，宗敎，家庭的反抗，乃是爲的要做一個人；「社會棟樑」雖曾無遺地暴露了當時挪威市民的僞善，但結果所指示給我們的，却是個人的自由比什麽都要重要；在「國民公敵」中的斯托曼醫生亦曾頑强地與舊勢力抗爭，但其中心意識却在於「世界上最强的人，便是那最孤獨的」；而「勃蘭德」中的勃蘭德更是將其最後的努力，付之於天上的嚮往；其他如「海上夫人」，「建築師」和其最後出的「復活的時候」，都是帶着濃厚的那樣的象徵主義的氣味的。</p>
<p>易卜生創作的長處，是在於他無情地暴露現實的罪惡，肯說實話，與夫他之生動地描畫其小市民的主人公的心理與行爲。有人說他是無比的小市民的心理學者，這是並非没有道理的。我以爲凡是研究小市民的心理學的人，都有一讀他的創作之必要。在他的劇作中，往往愛用使人意料不到的驚人的塲面，來抓住一般現象的心理，來實行他的說敎。譬如「傀儡家庭」吧，起初他是把主人公娜拉描畫得非常和善，像「小斑鳩兒」，「小松鼠兒」似的，使人意料不到這樣的人還會反抗，還會離家出走；但隨着他即以偶然的事變來刺激她的心靈，使她表示出堅决的反抗精神，整理行裝，决心出走了。於是，驚人的塲面出現，和平空氣消失，使觀衆演員也和作者一樣緊張起來；於是乘此機會易卜生便借着娜拉的嘴開始了他的說敎。——在這樣的法則下，易卜生的創作收到了莫大的藝術的效果。可是，他的象徵主義却是使得他的說敎曖昧貧弱了，因而在藝術上也給了他的作品以莫大的傷害。</p>
<h3>默念</h3>
<p>— 白英</p>
<p>小屋子旁邊，長着一棵枝葉茂密的槐樹。雖然是末秋了，葉子落的還没有幾個。溫暖的陽光，被遮得緊緊地，陰森森的空氣，有時侵得我滿身起着鷄皮疙瘩。</p>
<p>傍晚。</p>
<p>我坐在這小屋子的窗下，看那戰敗的萎黃的槐葉，一片片地從樹枝間滾下，摔在地上，又被秋風帶到牆角。</p>
<p>——這是多麽有詩意啊！</p>
<p>我默念着。然而我不是詩人，旣没有鑑賞的心情，也不存什麽神秘的感觸。只有如消失了的殘夢般的往事，驀然地浮上心頭。</p>
<p>首先想到的是五年前因爲失了業在家鄉的時候。那時，記不清是誰和誰正在打着仗，天天過着兵，村裏逃得一個人也没有。－我的家鄉，本來是在深山裏，據說：除了閙義和拳，過過一回洋鬼子兵，就是這回了。洋鬼子兵眞利害，殺人放火，他們都做。所以給我們那裏的人們，留了一個「兵」比「强盜」還可怕的印象。兵來了第一個法子就是逃。老總們一見没有了人就生氣，任意毀壞起來。最後，不但村裏的人没有了，而且房間的東西也空了。</p>
<p>記得第一次兵還未到時候，年老的父親，早把家裏的人，送到姑母家去住，他和我在家守着門。坐在書齋裏。－－和我這小屋子大小差不多的一個書齋。</p>
<p>——今天大槪又不來了。</p>
<p>父親看了我一眼。</p>
<p>——小福子剛才探到馬溝莊，没一點消息。</p>
<p>——你還不如不回來好呢！住在北京，雖然當下没事，然而總比在家「活」的多。現在路上這樣不平安，什麽時候才能走？在北京也不致於像在家裏這樣害怕呀！</p>
<p>——可不是！</p>
<p>——以後，咱們日子就好過了······再過三年，你兄弟也就畢了業。······</p>
<p>父親顯示着一幅得意微笑的面孔。</p>
<p>······</p>
<p>「三年」？現在已經過了五年了啊？「日子好過」在那裏？年老的父親，因了過度的勞碌，憂慮，已經死了。弟弟雖然畢了業，現在在家失業，曾經給他找點事做。他說家裏這幾年更難過了，希望我寄點錢回去。</p>
<p>錢，那裏有去寄呢！本來幾十塊錢維持一個小家庭就不容易。我又有什麽方法來安插我的兄弟呢！</p>
<p>父親，兄弟，家，從我的眼底現出來。</p>
<p>黃昏漸漸地在凄慘中統治了這世界。</p>
<h3>明天（十一）</h3>
<p>— （Joseph　Cornad）著吳向隅譯</p>
<p>海格波特船長，因爲講到他的衣服而懊惱，拿了他的剷，偷偷走到裏面去，兩個立在門外的人，猛被關門的聲音吃了一驚，隨後又聽到關門聲，上鎖聲，及裏面佯笑的回響。」</p>
<p>經過短時沉默後，那人說：「我不願打擾他。」「這一切是什麽意呢？他並不十分瘋呀」。</p>
<p>「他爲失去的兒子煩惱已經長久，」貝珊用低的抱歉的口氣說。</p>
<p>「哎，我就是他的兒子。」</p>
<p>「哈利！」她驚呼出來——隨後又極端沉默下去。</p>
<p>「曉得我的名字？同老頭子是朋友，哎？」</p>
<p>「他是我們的地主，」她囁嚅地說出，同時手去握住鐵栅。</p>
<p>「兩間兎圈都是他所有的麽，他是不是？」小梅格波特輕蔑地問：「這是他認爲可以驕傲的東西。你能告訴我麽，誰是那明天要來的傢伙？你一定曉得這事的一部分。我告訴你這是老頭子的騙局，没有别的。」</p>
<p>她不回答，在這不可克服困難的前面，她無能爲力，這必要的，而又能的，怕去解釋的事件前面，使她吃驚不小，在這情形裏面，她似乎也牽涉在瘋狂以內。</p>
<p>「啊！我是非常抱歉的」，她喃喃地說。</p>
<p>「什麽一會事？」他鎭靜地說。「你不必担憂引起我的不快。那也許是别個人當他一點也没想到的時候，會不快。我並不怕絞死；但當那個人明天出現的時候，就要有把戲看了。我並不要老頭子的家產，但權利總是權利。我將看到我要和那一個混蛋拚一拚，不問他是誰！」</p>
<p>他已經走得近些，他在鐵栅的那面比她高大了不少。他偷看她的兩手。他揣想她在在顫抖，這忽然使他想到她也許參與明天那件對付他的老頭子的小把戲。他來得剛正好去破壞他們的把戲。他被引起了這種觀念——對於那被他識破的計策甚輕蔑。但他有生以來對於一切女人的詭計，却是極其寬容的。她的顫抖實在頗爲厲害，她的包頭從她的頭上溜滑下來。「可憐的魔鬼」他想。「不要替那個傢伙担心。我敢說在明天以前他就會改變他的主張的。但怎樣對付我呢？我是不能在這門前閒度到明天早上。」</p>

<h3>紗花空方稍戒懼標紗買賣漸漸减少</h3>
<p>紗市晨跌午漲、形勢尙屬平靜、因通成公司及一般多頭看高觀念極深、故吸收之額頗巨、拉力日强、但現紗客銷日漸冷澹、賣方鑒於多方之動作、咸具戒心、不敢貿然抛空、所以標紗生意漸漸减少矣、</p>
<p>（金鷄晨跌午回）標紗前市開盤、因外棉回跌、致人氣略疲、塲中賣者稍多、各月均跌五·四·五·六角、但成交甚少、午後聞現紗交易增加、而棉市回漲、有一部份抵空、形勢轉挺、各月均漲一·三·四·五·六角、全日成交統計一萬零六百五十包、查賣出通記五百包、逹記六百包、愼記二百包、長豐一千五百包、恊成三百五十包、同和六百包、德記二百五十包、愼昌二百包、愼裕二百包、買進賡豐二百包、明德二百五十包、均昶二百包、長餘二百五十包、仁豐四百五十包、大孚三百包、錦昌七百五十包、潤康六百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>來源零落棉花欲跌又止</h3>
<p>棉市始跌後漲、但一般買方態度極、因堅各路來源凋零、上海存棉枯薄、故拉進之額、堅不吐放、惟現棉消費頗清淡、各廠採辦甚少、但源大號逢漲必抛賣云、</p>
<p>（鄭標漲跌五分）標棉前市開盤、市氣鬆落、因上日多數心理、預料美印棉市均有續漲之望、詎來電反趨下落、致多頭大爲失望、塲內買户缺乏、然新賣者亦稀、結果各月跌一角半至二角半、午後開盤突然轉緊、市上又有流言、謂有一部份印度棉洋行結轉之說、於是買風驟起、各月均漲一·二·三角、全日成交統計五萬三千九百擔、查賣出吉豐一千九百擔、大豐二千二百擔、遠大二千擔、長餘一千二百担、仁豐一千担、益康一千八百擔、源興昌一千一百擔、源大三千六百擔、同興一千七百擔、長和二千七百擔、買進均昶一千擔、長豐五千五百擔、生源一千四百擔、恒益一千一百擔、義成　千四百擔、永昌一千一百擔、一日間最高低價　收盤價列下、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平疲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回小二角另、坎拿大跌三四角左右、故開價後、各月份市氣、即見平疲、本月份開價即落一分、遠期至一分外、客帮交易、仍然停頓、祗業外多頭、交易依然暢旺、廠方出數、已見零星、故形勢雖已逆轉、跌度尙未巨大也迨至下午開盤、本月份市面、尙未平定、遠期則繼續向下、傳廠方又續定澳麥二船、價四元七角三分、不過對市塲之抛售、則趨觀望、故雖有此消息、市面並不大虛也、結果本月份跌二分、一月份跌一分七厘半、二月份跌一分七厘半、三月份跌二分二厘半、四月份跌二分、五月份跌二分半、</p>
<h3>麥市形同停頓</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平疲盤旋之象、以洋麥報價、回落二三四角左右不等、市塲人心、當然生氣减少、目下之關鍵、終因國曆結賬已近、各方賣買、無形停頓、且國麥之籌碼、已經落令、此後之發展、必須希望洋麥之進口也、上下午各盤、交易均寂、價稍軟弱、結果本月份較跌三分、二月份跌二分、餘均不動、現麥市面、仍見穩定、高貨喊起一二分、中次如常、開歸德麥三元九角八分、徐州麥三元九角七分、海州麥三元九角二分、漢口麥三元七角三分、明光麥三元九角四分、由　新去四十包、阜豐去一千包、申大去一千包云、</p>

<p>現洋米跟好一角</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、極形緊俏、因長沙漢口沙市各地均有來電報漲、產價激漲一角半以上、故此間售價一律喊高二角、但有洋麥關係、結果只漲一角及角半、惟客化甚活、內地更貪、本街及崇沙寗紹均有問津、全日開出湘米七千八百十六包、蕪湖元米二百四十八包、漢沙各米三千九百七十二包、洋米現貨亦跟大一角、開出二千多包、期貨成交二千噸、多數爲洋行抽出、價亦跟好數分云、</p>

<p>（歐美絲銷尙不寂寞）海外市塲、因日絲繼續上漲、對華絲頗有進胃、昨晨滬埠續有電轉交易、計怡和等進滬白廠經六十包、白乾經六十包、價均趨漲、</p>
<h3>平水珠茶法銷略動</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、浙省平水珠茶、法莊銷路略形活動、全市共由同孚永興英發等行、買進蔴珠二百九十餘箱、售價自五十三元至五十八元、較前見跌四五元、此外婺源北路珍眉綠茶、英莊怡和洋行、購進三百餘箱、其餘貢熙秀眉針眉等項、均無交易、形勢依然沉寂、</p>
<h3>糖市新潮青僅到七百餘包</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、趨勢稍見軟弱、公會划盤二四粗砂白普通現貨十八元五角三分、本棧貨十八元六角三分、略有交易、比前日均小二分、轉口貨呌五元二角未成、八九號尙未現貨普通呌十四元、轉口貨ＫＯ嘜四元九角半、ＫＮＧ嘜四元八角、太古糖Ｂ嘜十九元六角、交易寥寥、本廠綿白振記振裕一號均爲十七元角、零星開出市勢堅定、新潮青昨山東恊生兩輪入口、統共僅到七百數十包、今日可以見樣開盤、預測或須略漲、藍貨稀供不應求、</p>
<h3>南北貨泉泡元地價升三四元</h3>
<p>泉州泡圓昨福東告抵、統共運到一千八百七十四箱、據貨客函訊、地頭存底已稀、大部份均在焙户手內、不肯賤卸、且頗居奇、故此次各客辦下之貨、市價竟升三四元、均主飛漲不兌、但申市銷路正在清　之際、中下檔軋缺、或可加漲、上檔則不易轉升、</p>
<h3>五金白鉛皮靜極思動</h3>
<p>白鉛皮自去年秋季一度飛俏後、迄今無日不在衰疲中、雖各同業爲血本攸關、竭力兜銷、但終以環境險惡、不久即疲、惟近幾日來、市勢有靜極思動、茶帮已有採辦、而電池廠因冬銷甚繁、亦出乎添配、是以成交頗爲可觀、行情除二號五號各加起二角半、如二號售二十七元七角半、五號售二十六元五角外、别花色悉無上落、聞昨開出共有四十餘桶之多、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>新武器恐怖</h3>
<p>— 其</p>
<p>在現在，各國都在期待着「未來大戰」的降臨，眞的，每二次大戰的發生，彷彿是不可避免的了。在這一次的大戰中，「弱肉强食」自然是意料中的事，但是，「强肉」呢？是不肯輕巧被食的，那末，咱們得準備着武力，拚一個你死我活。</p>
<p>談起武力，似乎不是一個簡單的問題，而武力的首要條件，則是武器。大刀，長矛，太舊了，太不合用了，那長槍會給你一個致命傷的。呵，不成，長槍，甚至機關槍，也都有點腐化了，時代的需要，已經不是牠們的力量所能趕得上，牠們在漸次的被摒棄了。</p>
<p>「創造新武器」吧，這口號彌漫了整個的世界。</p>
<p>所謂新武器，自然要用最新的方法吞食了過往一切的笨絀的，於是「死光」在試騐了，成功了。據說這「光」在刷到了人的身上，可以使人的知覺麻木，像喝醉了酒一樣，不用什麽軍械，就能服服貼貼地，聽憑你擺佈。</p>
<p>但是，竟有「死光」還是不足的，因爲在發明者是須要盡「保守秘密」的義務，那末，假使眞的打起來的話，你有一道光刷過來，而我，没有東西還敬過去，似乎有些「不美」，不能像我們封神榜上所標列着的演習一回天空大鬥法，未免是一件憾事。</p>
<p>然而，時代畢竟是動的，所認爲遺憾的事，在經過某一個過程裏，或者能擺出了點顏色給你看看的。</p>
<p>許是凑巧，翻開了晚報就有這樣一條！</p>
<p>——······繼「死光」後之新武器，又有「死音」。死音爲使人致死之特殊音波，經科學家研究其構造原理，謂極有可能，其原則大致根據普通人類所聞聲音之每秒振動數，在此數之上或下，爲人類不能聽逹之聲音。現將其振動數增大，變爲一種極端之高短波，不可聽之音波，牠的力量能使聞者輕則癲狂，重則致死。······</p>
<p>在上面這段研究中，好像是一種新鮮的玩藝，但，當這不同的，新的玩藝開始展其力量的時候，人類的被其摧毁以至破滅，這是可能的。</p>
<p>站在大恐怖的前夜，站在新武器鯨吞之前，强食的弱肉，就任憑淘汰麽？</p>
<h3>路</h3>
<p>— 許席珍</p>
<p>阿虎跟着二伯他們第一次給鄉間的小航船帶到上海的時候，已是初冬的季節了。</p>
<p>在大都會的街上走着的時候，身上的單薄的夾襖袴給冷風打得拍拍的響；抖了一下，可是並不覺得冷「瞧着那些無千無萬的商店裏的大减價的旗子和五彩的電光，心眼兒都笑开啦。想着鄉裏鎭上的小舖子，在透着黃色的玻璃上歪欠地貼着的「特别大放盤」的紅紙條兒，眞是呌人怪不快意的。</p>
<p>到傍晚二伯找到了在城裏的一個人家當車夫的堂兄弟，他帶他們到一個親戚的空着的閣樓上去住宿。這樣，他們便到了上海啦。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，二伯帶着阿虎出去逛街，（其實是去認路的），在街角裏他們聽到一個測字的在喊：</p>
<p>「阿要試試看，靈勿靈當塲試騐！</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>四隻銅板，要問到流年運道，生意財氣，還要問到尋生意調生意！」</p>
<p>「尋生意調生意！」那麽一句動人的廣告碰的一聲打響了這個鄉下出來的老年「生意人」底心，像給一種不可抵的力吸引了似的，不由自主地，在那個測字攤面前停住了，堅决地搯出了八個銅子，給自己與阿虎問問「生意財氣」。</p>
<p>結果是怪呌人高興的：二個人全是流年大利，路路亨通！</p>
<p>回去的時候，二伯竟笑啦。（據阿虎所記得的：從五月節以來，還是第一次看見二伯那麽高興地笑呢。）三遍二遍的說着：「阿虎，我說天無絶人之路，到底是上海好，我們是路路亨通」，喝，你聽！」</p>
<p>把那個「吉利的好兆」像寳物一般的緊緊地密藏在心頭，第三天的下午便又去找着了那個當車夫的堂兄：「老哥，你上海的市面熟，給我想想法子看，有什麽生意的『路』没有？」</p>
<p>可是這回答，是比測字先生底「路路亨通更呌老二吃驚的，「噯，你眞把什麽都看得那樣容易！上海有那麽多的『生意』等着你嗎？你能做什麽：做工？你不見得有牛那麽大的力氣；再說，比你强的還在上海要飯過日子哩；做買賣？偌大的店舖减了價還没人來交易，「家家的關掉哩。」</p>
<p>可是話雖然够呌老二吃驚啦，然而却說不服他：他不信，那麽好的一個上海就没有他底「路」。</p>
<p>自己也過了花甲啦，在鄉下盤了一爿小店，少說也有十年了吧？然而這樣的年頭却從來不曾看見過：「挺硬」的貨品像洋火，肥皂，毛巾之類的日用品都没人要。實在的話，米店裏的白米都没人買哩！寗可自己吃山芋，這情形老二自己就經到過，知道得挺清楚。</p>
<p>和堂兄弟談了一天，才相信「路路亨通」的話有點兒靠不住了：連阿虎要想拉洋車都不成：拉洋車還要打保，這是老二連做夢都没想到的。</p>
<p>而阿虎，那麽結實的一個小夥子，他也呆住了。</p>
<p>想把從鄉下的那爿倒閉了的「京廣雜貨」舖子子裏帶出來的一點小貨同阿虎二個在街頭擺個小攤，可是據說又不成：先得繳攤捐：這麽着，這一點貨品也没用啦。瞧着帶出來的二塊多現錢一天天地少下來了，老二急得什麽的，好容易託堂兄弟把一些日用品賤買給了一家京貨店，拿到了五塊錢的時候，堂兄弟却說啦：「這年頭到處都没有路，上海是虎口，怪可怕的，我勸你們還是回鄉下去苦過一個冬再說吧。」</p>
<p>站在那兒，茫然了，什麽都没聽見，祇聽見了一句話：「這年頭到處都没有『路』。」</p>
<h3>打柴的老頭子「</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>「駝背老公公，鬍子撓鬆鬆，看見好娘娘，眼剩兩條縫。」當他每天出門去打柴的時候，便有一羣野孩子要追着他這樣喊，但他並不光火，總是回頭來笑着對他們說：「小囝頭嘸不規矩，晚些告訴了你的娘拷你。」</p>
<p>他爲人很慈和，因爲他慈和，所以許多孩子們都要去和他玩笑的。他今年六十八歲了，可還很壯健，他自己說：「不見誇口，四五個小夥子，勿拉我心上。」然而我去從没有看見他和誰打過一回架，或光過一回火，人家遇見他，他總是笑嘻嘻的招呼着。</p>
<p>我知道他姓忻，但是百家姓上不見有個忻字。至於他的名字我可不知道，便聽得人家呼他長毛公公；大槪就是他的名字了，然而記得從前太平天國時的官兵就呌長毛，那末他的名字也許是一個綽號吧！在我們村中，他没有班輩，無論老幼都呌他長毛公公。他呢，見了老些的婦人，呌嫂嫂，年青的便是新娘娘，没有出嫁的是姑娘，女孩子都呌小妹妹。呌起男人來也是一樣，老兄，老弟，小弟弟，小囝頭，遇着穿長衫的，却要呌先生或少爺了。</p>
<p>他住的房子是米姓的墳莊屋，終年靠打柴爲生，在屋傍的兩方小地上，他種滿了兩園綠油油的青菜。他無時無節，也不過年，村里人家有了事，那他得當一份燒火的差使，但並不和人家計較過報酬的厚薄，所以人家逢到過年過節，總要去送一些糕糰菜餚等給他吃的。他也愛喝酒，但不多量，一百錢原梁至少須做二天過癮，可是不喝那又不行，多少倒不在乎。他除喝酒之外，也抽幾筒旱烟，這兩樣總算是他生平的唯一嗜好。</p>
<p>講到他的生活，他每天早上一天亮便起身，抽一筒旱烟，登一個坑，到菜園里去巡視一週，看看有没有人來偸菜去，回來做了飯吃，便上山去打柴，中飯是不回來吃的，因爲來去要費很多工夫，所以他總帶些饝饝，或山芋之類去充饑，這樣又好多打幾捆柴，在太陽落山時才回來。回來了挑水澆菜，等到一切舒緒了，那纔將冷飯炒炒熱吃了，睡在床上，又得打量着明天應做的事情。</p>
<p>有一天，我因爲天下雨閒着，因此去找到了他談；到他家里，他恰在做草鞋，我們話了半天，他告訴我太平天國時的長毛麽兇，逃難的百姓是怎樣苦，官兵是那末殘忍的，他這時候還年幼，跟了他父親逃了出來，他母親是給長毛殺死了！他又說：</p>
<p>「父親逃到了這里，便替人家做做工，晚上就和我宿在這里，到現在我還宿在這里。因爲我歡喜講長毛的故事，因此人家都呌我長毛，其實我的本名是呌阿毛。」</p>
<h3>冬大衣</h3>
<p>— 晶</p>
<p>灰黑色的浮雲，像久　的破棉絮般的彌漫了整個的天空，冰塊似的凝凍着，一絲見瞧不見那一處有着青碧的裂縫；天，委實是低得好像蓋在人們的頭上。</p>
<p>初冬的寒風，似刀般呼呼地從枯黃的樹梢頭直瀉下來，沙沙地捲下了片片的落葉。沿着馬路的行人道上，稀疎的往返的行人，都給那挾着沙塵的寒風吹刮得縮着頸急速地走着。雖則百貨商店的樓上的吹鼓手，還在拚命地吹着，打着，然而門前却冷落得瞧不見一個主顧，祇有樓上傳送下來的「桃花江」歌曲，把那些店員們都催眠得有幾分倦態，仰着頭打着呵欠。站在路旁的街燈，吐着昏黃的光輝，乏力地，没有勁兒地，在</p>
<h3>彼此利用</h3>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>冬天的黃昏裏，似乎也感到天氣的寒冷，不住地戰慄着。</p>
<p>「天氣已漸漸地寒冷了，說不定快要下雪了，没有大衣是不行的。」當何連轉進那條清靜的小路，他分外地感到那寒風的厲害，把手足都凍得冷冰冰的有些兒麻木起來，暗地裏私自呢喃着。</p>
<p>於是，何連想起存在當舖裏的他底冬天的大衣了。</p>
<p>同時，他又想起昨天到他的朋友的家裏赴宴的時候所遭遇的一椿事－這椿事情現在想起來，還會使他的瘦削蒼白的臉孔頓時地泛上一朶紅雲，他底心像隱藏着許多的小蟲兒在爬着咬着一樣地難過，那個時候，他眞的連美好的菜色都没有心情好好兒地享受着：</p>
<p>當何連跨進他的朋友的家裏的時候，那陳設得很華麗的客廳已坐滿着許多客人，於是，朋友某君就爲他一一地介紹。當他和一位年輕小姐握手的時候，他覺得那位小姐一接觸着他的冰冷的手掌，不自覺地打了寒噤，頓時地雞皮似的栗子就在她的滿塗着胭脂的粉臉上浮現出來，這眞使他慚愧得恨不得有個洞裏可以馬上鑽進去，他的朋友某君也似乎有點覺得怎麽一回事，暗地裏對着他說：</p>
<p>「連，這幾天你不覺得冷嗎？怎麽不把大衣穿出來？」</p>
<p>也許流浪人的悲哀的生活的情况，在有些遺產的某君是不大知道的，正如深居簡出的富貴的人們的哲理中，不信着窮人們窮困得連飯吃都没有的情形一樣。然而面子又誰個不要呢？</p>
<p>「唔，因爲中午出門的，那時的陽光和暖得很呢······」說到這裏，可有客人來了，朋友又忙着招待，何連終於把下文擱下去了。</p>
<p>「冬天的大衣是非拿出來不行的」。當何連跨出他的朋友的大門迎着刺骨的寒風踏上黃包車回到家裏的時候，在歸途中他已打算着明天就把擱在箱裏的兩套夏季的衣服，送進當舖裏去，然後再把冬天的大衣拿出來。</p>
<h3>母親和妻子</h3>
<p>— 不</p>
<p>母親－　　多病的母親。</p>
<p>妻子－是個新婚的妻子。</p>
<p>他－母親的兒子，妻子的丈夫，是個還不能自立的二十歲開外的青年。</p>
<p>母親愛他，妻子也愛他，他十分幸福地接受着兩種不同的愛。</p>
<p>他有魚，同時他也有熊掌。可是這種天仙似的環境，事實上是不允許的，母親愛的是他，不是他的妻子：妻子愛的是他，不是他的母親，倘然母親和妻子都能愛屋及烏的話，那末，他的幸福是可以維持下去的。</p>
<p>可是女人終究是女人－她們的愛是直覺的，她們不會顧慮到兩個人的吵鬧痛苦是會加到自己心愛的身上去。</p>
<p>病前的母親是溫順的。可是整年的生病把她的性子練成暴戾了。</p>
<p>妻子呢？是忠於丈夫的，祗要她的理由不錯，對方的襲擊是要盡力地自衛的。</p>
<p>可是給病魔練得暴戾了的母親，却時時要履行做阿婆的，在她心目中認爲固有的職權，於是她指妻子的分辯是反抗，是忤逆不給些顏色看是收不下塲的。</p>
<p>於是幸福的皂泡是給走了氣。</p>
<p>怪誰呢？妻子，她並没錯；母親，她是自身的創造者呀！</p>
<p>痛苦的繩索緊緊地纏住他，他没力調解，也不敢庇護任何一方。</p>
<p>這樣不幸的危機蘊藏着蘊藏着，終於有一天爆發出來——</p>
<p>ＸＸ醫院三樓的一間病房裏，搬進一個服毒的少婦和一個驚慌失措的青年。男的口切地問那個正在施手術的醫生：</p>
<p>－有救嗎？</p>
<p>怪可憐的目光像法庭上求饒的罪犯。</p>
<p>－遲了！</p>
<p>放下了針，醫生一些没表情的回答。</p>
<p>和判决了死刑一樣，倒在妻的身上，兩手緊握着快僵硬的手指像招魂似的慘痛地喊着妻的名字：</p>
<p>－麗君！麗君！麗君！</p>
<p>淚水一滴滴落在自己愛看的女人慘白的面上，是一張徘徊在生死之門的妻子的臉呵！他希望那張緊閉着的嘴動起來，能够和自己說最後的幾句話。</p>
<p>可是一切都給命運判定了，妻的眼皮祗微微地抬動一下就再說不出什麽。</p>
<p>昏昏地像給妻帶走了靈魂一般，異常的刺激戳創了他的心，一閉眼妻的陰影就浮上來：他想起今早出來的時候，妻十分正經地問他說再會；可是誰想得到呢？這末輕的年紀（二十歲）這末小的事故（婆媳間免不了的口角）爲這末决心地走那條路。</p>
<p>想起妻已往的好處，想起妻目前的慘死，他眞想替她報仇，雖只犧牲他的生命也所不惜。可是無庸韙言的，釀成事變的是母親－是一個給病魔練成暴戾的母親呀！於是這個念頭只得永遠讓它沉在肚底裏。</p>
<p>怪誰呢？這婆媳間的鴻溝！</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Interior is scheduled to convene representatives from Hebei Province and Beiping City on the afternoon of the 8th to discuss the issue of border demarcation between Hebei Province and Beiping City. According to Yuan Liang, the Hebei Provincial Government has not yet agreed to the border demarcation. He came to Beijing to ask for instructions and will listen to the Central Government's handling of the matter without any preconceptions. If the expansion of the Tianjin urban area can be realized, he will thoroughly reorganize the famous scenic spots and various constructions in the future and plans to establish a Committee for the Organization of Cultural Relics of the Old Capital, which will be supervised by the municipal government to carry out everything. He will return to the north in two or three days. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Fan Renfu and other four representatives from Wanping and Daxing counties in Hebei Province went to the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 7th to petition. Chu Minyi received them and promised to forward the opinions expressed by the representatives to the President of the Yuan. He also expressed that he would respect public opinion and had no intention of incorporating Wanping, Daxing, Changping and other counties into the urban area. He also said that a solution has been decided regarding the border demarcation issue, roughly dividing the Beiping Nanwan Airport business street into Beiping City, and the Tangshan Hot Spring area will also be assigned to Beiping City, while the rest will still belong to the respective counties, etc. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government has additionally dispatched Provincial Committee member Zhang Yinwu to Beijing to attend the Hebei-Beiping border demarcation meeting convened in Beijing on the 8th.

Yu Xuezhong said that the Hebei Provincial Government has dispatched Provincial Committee members Zhang Lisheng, Hu Yuanhui, and Zhang Yinwu, along with assistant members Fu Weiji and Huang Zengyuan, to the meeting convened in Beijing on the 8th regarding the Hebei-Beiping border demarcation issue. The Provincial Government has formulated proposals for this meeting, which have been sent to Beijing in advance for reference. It is inconvenient to announce the points on which each attending committee member's speech is based, but it is still based on the two points of contention decided in the province's previous routine meetings: 1. Re-negotiate the management responsibilities of the counties adjacent to the city, and order continuous methods for municipal public utilities. 2. Re-survey the existing urban boundaries in order to determine what belongs to the province and what belongs to the county. For example, if the surrounding area of Nanwan with a radius of forty li is assigned to the city, it would be too large. If a part is assigned to the city, it must be decided after actual surveying.

<h3>Yu Xuezhong Reports to Beiping on the Reorganization of the Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Preparations for Moving to Baoding Have Not Yet Begun</p>

Because he cannot leave the provincial government's duties, he will return to Tianjin tomorrow afternoon. Although the Central Government previously issued an order regarding the relocation of the Hebei Provincial Government, the specific location and date of the relocation have not yet been determined, and the provincial government has not made preparations. Regarding the issue of border demarcation between Hebei, Beiping province and city, the Hebei Provincial Government has sent Zhang Lisheng, Hu Yuanhui, and Zhang Yinwu, three committee representatives from the Hebei Provincial Government, to Beijing to attend the border demarcation meeting to be held in Beijing on the 8th. The representatives will conduct responsible negotiations based on the established policies of the Provincial Government meeting.

(Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 4:00 p.m. today, Yu Xuezhong went to Beiping to pay respects to Huang Fu, reported on the inauguration of the Hebei Provincial Committee, and attended the routine meeting of the Military Branch Committee on Monday. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong said that preparations have not yet been made for the provincial government to move to Baoding, because this matter is completely subject to the Central Government's orders. No one has been sent to Baoding in advance to make arrangements. The more suitable existing buildings in Baoding are the former Qing Dynasty imperial palaces, but they have been dilapidated and need to be repaired before they can be used. In the future, after sending someone to survey, the repair work will be decided. Although the houses are narrow, in order to realize the spirit of joint office, they must try to accommodate 4,000 personnel. As for the so-called relocation in January next year, the provincial government has not yet considered this. The 51st Army is under my command, and for the convenience of handling affairs, it must also be moved. However, the troops stationed along the Jinpu Railway each have their own defense areas and have been stipulated, so there is no need to change them. As for whether to set up an office or a garrison in Tianjin, it will be determined according to the situation after the relocation is realized. Joint office of the provincial government, no matter where the provincial government is relocated, will be implemented on January 1 next year. Three sections each will be established in the four departments of civil affairs, finance, education, and construction, and there will be no further delay. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>British Envoy Establishes Residence in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(London) During today's session in the House of Commons, the issue of establishing a British embassy residence in Nanjing was raised. Conservative Party Member of Parliament, Mr. Angliu, inquired of Foreign Secretary Simon whether he could make a statement regarding the matter of a British embassy residence in Nanjing. Simon replied that the matter had been carefully considered and that it was hoped that the British Consulate-General in Nanjing could be suitable for the use of the British envoy. The member then asked if another residence could be found for the Consul-General. Simon replied that it could be properly arranged, but he was not aware of the details. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Regarding Japan's Expenditure Budget for 1935</h3>
<p>In this year's total expenditure of the Japanese national treasury, military expenditure alone accounts for 44 percent. The magnitude of this figure is unprecedented. In the 1931 fiscal year, Japan's military expenditure accounted for 30.4 percent of total expenditure, totaling 406 million yen. Last year, it increased to 936 million yen. In just a few years, it has more than doubled, which cannot but surprise the world, especially its neighbors, who are on guard.</p>
<p>1936 is Japan's so-called year of extraordinary national crisis. In order to preemptively act, it will announce the abandonment of the Washington and London treaties in 1935, advocating equality in armaments. In addition, it will gradually implement its planned continental policy. Expanding armaments is one of its national policies, and increasing military expenditure budget is naturally an inevitable result. However, Japan's current financial situation is very urgent. Excessive tax increases will cause the industrial and financial sectors to stagnate due to excessive burdens. Issuing public bonds, if exceeding last year's limit, will not only put too much burden on the national treasury, but also hinder the financial resources for wartime finances. When the real emergency comes, unexpected difficulties will arise. This is what Japanese financial circles are most worried about. In short, relying on public bonds to support finance is indeed uneconomical from the government's point of view, and the people are indirectly burdened, even to the extent that their descendants are burdened by debt. Therefore, knowledgeable people in Japanese financial circles mostly oppose this move. Ordinary people with financial knowledge believe that the government should not focus on this. The Japanese financial authorities also vigorously advocated that they could not break through this year's budget figure when preparing the budget, and that the issuance of public bonds could not exceed 700 million yen. However, in the final figures, the army still added 27 million yen, and the navy also added 27 million yen. The total army expenditure was 491 million yen, and the navy expenditure was 530 million yen. Military expenditure totaled more than 1.021 billion yen, accounting for 48 percent of the total expenditure of 2.125 billion yen. This is 85 million yen more than this year's new figure and is almost the same as the expenditure during the Russo-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Although the expansion of armaments is now prevalent internationally, the military expenditure of the United Kingdom and the United States has not exceeded 15 percent of the total expenditure. France is slightly larger, but it only accounts for 21 percent of the total expenditure. Even so, it has made the people of Europe anxious. Recently, the naval reduction preparatory talks have reached a deadlock. The United Kingdom and the United States are racking their brains to figure out how to continue to maintain their vested interests in the Far East. The increase in Japan's military expenditure may be said to be to defend against the crisis of 1936 and has no other intentions, but in the general situation of the world, it will inevitably lead to military expansion. It should be known that breaking the previous naval ratio is opposed by the United States, and the United Kingdom's desire to grasp the authority of the "Maritime Kingdom" is still as strong as before. If Japan really wants to prepare to build a naval force equal to that of the United Kingdom and the United States, would they be willing to lag behind and not strive to compete? Moreover, strong countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States also know that promoting the military industry is one of the effective ways to adjust economic panic. In that case, the future arms race will be more intense than before 1921. The conflict of interests between countries will be more intense than before that year, which is all expected. Supposing that Japan's foreign export trade will be reduced due to the restrictions on Japanese goods imported by various countries. At that time, the loss of industry will have a greater impact on finance than it does today. The financial problem is indeed a difficult hurdle in Japanese politics. I don't know how the Japanese will support their position in international conferences under financial pressure.</p>

<h3>Japan Declares Treaty Abolishment When London Talks End</h3>
<p>Treaty Still Valid for Two Years</p>
<p>America Still Hopes to Find a Way to Cooperate</p>
<p>Security and Equality: United Kingdom and United States Have Consistent Opinions</p>
<p>(Washington) The highest authority of the State Department announced today that the date when Japan abolishes the Washington and London Naval Treaties will be the date when the United States considers the London Naval Talks to have ended. It is said that, according to the United States, Japan's abolition of the treaty is tantamount to withdrawing from the talks. However, if Japan can simultaneously propose a concrete plan to replace the arms reduction principles of the Washington and London treaties, the talks can continue. Officials are paying more attention to one thing, that is, even if Japan announces the abolition of the treaty, the Washington Treaty will still be effective until the end of 1936. It is hoped that countries can achieve something before the treaty expires, so as to implement arms reduction and mutual cooperation. Davis, the US representative, said that if Japan insists on abolishing the treaty, the United States will compete with Japan to build warships in order to maintain the ratio of 5:5:3. Semi-official sources here have been greatly shocked by this, because although Washington has repeatedly made this statement before, it is the first time that it has been formally announced. Washington observers said that although Davis's words were of an informal nature and he should be responsible for them personally, Secretary of State Hull and President Roosevelt have probably fully agreed. Moreover, Davis's words were directed at Japan. Davis said that the US position is "security and equality" rather than the "equality of armaments" demanded by Japan. Since the beginning of the naval talks, the United Kingdom and the United States have strongly stated that although they are willing to seek arms reduction with Japan, they have no intention of jointly targeting Japan. However, according to observers, the policies of the United Kingdom and the United States are almost completely consistent on the issue of equality. The term "security and equality" used by Davis yesterday was also quoted by British Foreign Secretary Simon in his recent statement on British policy. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Vice Admiral Yamamoto, Japan's chief expert commissioner for naval talks, recently issued a declaration to a representative of the Havas Agency, expressing Japan's efforts to establish a general agreement, saying, "The current system of naval limitations will disappear, and I don't even want to consider it." The United States has stated that if the Washington Naval Treaty is abolished, naval negotiations should end immediately. This attitude is incomprehensible. It should be known that Japan's decision to abolish the Washington Treaty was known to the world before we departed from Tokyo, and we formally notified all relevant countries when the London Naval Talks began. We are still continuing to work now. Although the date of future meetings has not been scheduled, technical talks will not be delayed." Yamamoto also said that the declaration of the abolition of the Washington Treaty has one advantage, that is, it can enable France and Italy to participate in the negotiations (Note: France and Italy are also signatories to the Washington Treaty), but it is regrettable that Japan's request for France and Italy to jointly declare the abolition of the treaty has not been met with satisfactory responses from France and Italy. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Treaty Abolition Leads to Naval Competition</h3>
<p>America Confident it Can Defeat Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States has notified Japan that it opposes the demand for naval equality and stated that if Japan insists on abolishing the naval treaty, naval competition will be inevitable. The United States also made a strong suggestion that it believes it can defeat Japan in naval competition. This declaration was made informally by Davis, the US representative for arms reduction, at a banquet for journalists in London. Davis declared that the US position is entirely based on the security and equality stipulated in the treaty and not on equality of armaments. Other proposals will be opposed by the United States. Abandoning the principles of the current treaty will inevitably lead to chaos and international suspicion, leading to an arms race that is detrimental to all countries. The United States believes that abandoning the current system that protects the security of all countries is a great misfortune. Davis finally said that we recognize that all countries should enjoy the right to security and equality. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>London Considers Second Phase Measures</h3>
<p>Two Preconditions at Present</p>
<p>(London) British officials believe that once the Washington Naval Treaty is declared abolished, the first phase of the preliminary naval talks will fail, and talks must be restarted. However, it has not yet been decided whether the second phase of the talks will still be handled by the current naval delegations of the various countries in London or will be conducted through other diplomatic procedures. However, when holding the second phase of the talks, some preconditions must be discussed first before considering whether the 1935 Naval Conference is suitable for convening. The so-called preconditions are (1) whether the United Kingdom and the United States can first conclude a treaty that only stipulates qualitative restrictions without involving total tonnage and ratios, so that Japan can join it at any time when it deems it appropriate, and other naval countries can also participate. (2) At the same time, all naval countries will discuss whether they can agree to notify other contracting countries of their annual warship construction plans. If, after the talks, it is recognized that notifying each other of warship construction plans is feasible, then the 1935 Naval Conference will take this as the main topic. Otherwise, a formal naval conference will not need to be convened. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>United Kingdom Expresses Views on Tonnage Qualitative Reduction</h3>
<p>(London) After US Representative Davis spoke yesterday, stating that the United States is prepared to accept quantitative reductions in tonnage, London has now reiterated its views on qualitative reductions in tonnage, stating that the British government has always opposed the excessive tonnage of battleships, aircraft carriers, and cruisers. It previously proposed in Geneva to reduce the maximum tonnage and gun caliber of such warships. The British government is now prepared to accept the reduction and limit this tonnage by 30 percent. Most of the major naval powers have approved this proposal. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Sophistry</h3>
<p>Believes Protecting Puppet State is a Natural Obligation</p>
<p>Claims Existing Treaty is Inapplicable, Wants a New Treaty</p>
<p>(London) Japanese Representative Yamamoto spoke to a Reuters interviewer today, referring to US Representative Davis's first formal announcement of the US position on naval power, saying that the reasons why the Japanese government changed its attitude towards the Washington Naval Treaty are varied, and one of the main reasons is the development of the air force. Secondly, Japan also feels responsible for protecting "Manchukuo" from harm from nearby places such as Soviet Russia or China. The naval reduction plans proposed by the United States and Japan are fundamentally different. Japan wants greater reductions, especially in offensive weapons, but the biggest difference is that the United States wants to retain ratios, while Japan wants to abolish ratios. The increase in the range of warships, allowing them to operate far from their domestic bases, is also an important reason why Japan feels that the Washington Naval Treaty cannot fully cope with naval development. Japan does not want a situation where the navy is completely unrestricted, but wants a more reasonable and fair new agreement. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, a certain close aide to Japanese Chief Expert Commissioner Vice Admiral Yamamoto gave a speech in Japanese, which was translated by an interpreter. The intention was to place the blame for the failure of the preliminary talks on the United States. He stated that Japan requested the establishment of a common maximum tonnage and did not want to reach the maximum common limit on all types of ships. We are still making this request today, which shows a willingness to compromise. This is what we do not hesitate to repeat." He also said, "If the United Kingdom and the United States can recognize this point, then we can discuss the Japanese proposal in detail on a technical level. If so, the most reliable way to implement 'equality in security' is what we provide, and people all over the world can see it." US officials said that after the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, the Four-Power Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty signed at the same time would also become invalid. How could they know that the naval treaty that we plan to declare abolished is legally unrelated to the Four-Power Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty? We will still abide by these treaties. In short, we will always strive to limit the navy within a fair range." This declaration by the Japanese spokesman came after US Representative Davis delivered a speech. The US government sent instructions to Davis, explaining the US government's attitude and saying that after Japan formally declared the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, if there were no new proposals that could give people new hope, the White House would have sufficient reason to end the current stage of the naval talks. All these details were not revealed by Davis until today. As for Davis's statement that the United States is prepared to continue the Washington and London naval treaties and make modifications to the details, British officials believe that this is a sign that the United States is accepting the British compromise plan. However, those close to Davis said that Davis's words should not be interpreted as such. Davis only said that if the current naval treaties can be continued, the United States is willing to fully consider the protests raised by the United Kingdom regarding the current system for large ships. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>America Advocates Universal Reduction of 20%</h3>
<p>Points of Contention Between United Kingdom and United States Easier to Resolve</p>
<p>(London) The naval talks do not seem to have mentioned the percentage of naval reductions, but according to Washington sources, the US government supports a 20% reduction in all types of warships, except for cruisers and aircraft carriers. The United States does not object to the United Kingdom's claim that the British Empire has a vast seaway and needs many cruisers. The statements of US Representative Davis can be regarded as an indication that the points of contention between the United Kingdom and the United States are easier to resolve. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, Secretary of State Hull did not want to criticize Davis's statements, but officials clearly stated that if Japan formally abolishes the Washington Treaty, the London Three-Power Talks have already ended. The only other option is for Japan to propose a naval limitation plan. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3>Seiyukai Temporarily Softens, Japanese House of Representatives Continues to Meet</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At the budget general meeting, which was scheduled to open at 1:30 PM, Sunada Shigemasa, representing the Seiyukai, had learned of the government's sincerity. All the Seiyukai members welcomed Prime Minister Okada's response with applause. Because the Seiyukai expressed compromise, the atmosphere of dissolving the parliament has been completely swept away. (Dentsu Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the budget general meeting ended this afternoon, the government convened an extraordinary cabinet meeting, deciding to extend the parliamentary session by two days, because the crisis of dissolving the parliament has passed. (Japan United Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Seiyukai President Suzuki Decides on Compromise Measures</h3>
<p>All-Night Meeting with Two Elders</p>
<p>Conditionally Approves Budget</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai's attitude towards the government budget could not be decided because there were hard-line and soft-line factions within the party. Therefore, it appointed President Suzuki to decide the verdict. On the evening of the 6th, Suzuki invited the two elders, Kuhara and Yamamoto, to his residence to negotiate until 2:00 AM the next morning. As a result of the three-person meeting, it was decided that the Seiyukai's attitude would be determined after confirming whether the government had sincerity at the budget general meeting. In other words, Prime Minister Okada's words alone could not understand the government's true intentions. However, the Seiyukai was afraid that submitting a separate resolution would cause serious political consequences, and this had to be avoided. Therefore, if the government showed sincerity at the budget general meeting on the 7th, respecting the Seiyukai's dignity, it could approve the government budget in view of the urgent implementation of the disaster budget, but this budget had to be subject to the conditions desired by the Seiyukai.</p>
<p>Since the Seiyukai president made a decision to approve the government budget, the talk of dissolving the parliament was slightly eased. However, the content of the conditions attached and the results of the budget general meeting still have the possibility of causing various problems. The future is still not optimistic. (Japan United Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Nakamura Uemon, the chief secretary of the Seiyukai, was dissatisfied with the Seiyukai's attitude and submitted a party withdrawal letter to the Seiyukai headquarters on the 7th, and also submitted a resignation letter as a member of parliament to the parliament.</p>
<p>Kanai Masao and Kaneko Yosao, also of the Seiyukai, were dissatisfied with the party headquarters and declared their withdrawal from the Seiyukai on the 7th regarding the government's budget. (Japan United Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Continued Opening of the House of Representatives in Japan to Pass the Budget</h3>
<p>Crisis of Dissolution Completely Eliminated</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the Budget Committee convened at 1:30 PM in a tense atmosphere. Suzuki, President of the Seiyukai party, also attended as an observer. First, Chairman Shimada spoke, saying that Prime Minister Okada's responses at yesterday's meeting and the Seiyukai's deliberations to decide its stance had unfortunately delayed the start of the meeting. Seiyukai member To-bu-kun and other committee members requested the Chairman to inquire about the government's opinion. The Chairman, in deference to the members' wishes, asked the government: Prime Minister, in your response yesterday, you used phrases such as "willing to consider." Is that meant to convey willingness to consider the content of each Diet member's questions, or to consider the opinions of Diet members and the general public regarding the budget proposal? Please clarify.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada replied, "The government has absolutely no intention of disregarding public opinion and implementing politics. We will sincerely implement politics in the future, taking into consideration necessary facilities based on actual circumstances. If necessary in the future, we will consider necessary facilities. The government considers public opinion and implements politics. This is parliamentary politics."</p>
<p>Chairman Shimada asked, "Does the government intend to increase the disaster budget?"</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada replied, "Beyond the current budget proposal, there is no intention to propose additional budget plans."</p>
<p>Chairman Shimada inquired whether any members of the Seiyukai party had comments to express. Okuchi Kiroku spoke, saying that the government's sincerity could be understood. According to the government's statement, the disaster budget was meticulously compiled, but upon actual observation of the situation, it is extremely inadequate.</p>
<p>Okuchi then described the plight of disaster-stricken areas, continuing, "How to rescue disaster areas is not only a problem that political parties should consider, but it is the opinion of the whole country. Since the Prime Minister has said that he will consider the overall will of the people and implement constitutional politics, we believe that the government is sincere. Therefore, we hope to immediately stop each person's questioning and begin discussing the motion proposed by the Seiyukai."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada said, "My statements will be reviewed in the minutes, and corrections may be made."</p>
<p>At this time, the assembly hall became noisy. Chairman Shimada said, "If the Prime Minister corrects his statement, we will have to temporarily suspend deliberations."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada replied, "The Chairman's interpretation seems to be a misunderstanding. Please continue deliberations."</p>
<p>Okuchi Kiroku then stood up and said, "I also believe that the Prime Minister's interpretation is the same as the Chairman's, so I have put forward a motion."</p>
<p>Chairman Shimada then declared a vote on Okuchi's motion, and the result was that it was adopted. The crisis of dissolving the Diet was thus eliminated. Thereafter, discussion began, the government's budget proposal was passed, and the meeting adjourned at 2:30 PM. (Jiji Press, 7th)</p>
<h3>Center of Parliament Shifts to the House of Peers</h3>
<p>Closing Ceremony to be Held on the 10th</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers, having received the budget proposal from the House of Representatives on the evening of the 7th, convened a plenary session at 7:30 PM. First, Finance Minister Takahashi explained the disaster budget proposal, which was then entrusted to a committee. The meeting adjourned around 8:00 PM, and it was decided to convene the Budget Committee from 10:00 AM on the 8th to conduct discussions. (Jiji Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The disaster budget proposal was passed by the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives on the afternoon of the 7th. Next, it will be approved by the plenary session and then submitted to the House of Peers. This extraordinary session of the Diet will be extended for two more days and is expected to conclude. On the morning of the 7th, due to Seiyukai President Suzuki's sudden unexpectedly firm stance, the government's attitude also hardened, and the possibility of dissolution became very strong. However, the crisis of dissolution has now been avoided. The Seiyukai and the government have reached a satisfactory resolution, so the center of the Diet has now shifted to the House of Peers. After concluding deliberations on the 8th and 9th, the closing ceremony is expected to be held on the 10th. (Jiji Press, 7th)</p>

<h3>European Crisis Turns Milder</h3>
<p>Saar Plebiscite Problem Partially Resolved</p>
<p>Russia and France Deny Signing a Mutual Defense Pact</p>
<p>(Geneva) There are two new developments in the European situation today that are easing the crisis. The difficult problem of the Saarland residents' plebiscite on whether to belong to Germany, France, or maintain the status quo has been partially resolved. Germany has accepted the Saar Commission's proposal to send international police to maintain order in the Saar. Germany and France had each threatened residents and those who voted against them with retaliation, accusing each other. Now, according to an agreement, British, Italian, and other European countries will send troops to the Saar within a week. In addition, French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov have signed a treaty allowing France and Russia not to enter into any agreement that would hinder the Eastern Locarno Pact. Both representatives denied that there had been any alliance between France and Russia before and solemnly stated that this was the first treaty in which France and Russia adopted the same foreign policy. Recently, there was a saying in the French House of Representatives that France and Russia had already signed a military alliance treaty, saying that if Germany attacked France, Russia would help France attack Germany. Today, the statements of the French and Russian representatives have incidentally denied this statement. (Kokumin News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Laval has signed an agreement with Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov stipulating that France and Russia shall not enter into non-aggression treaties with other countries without each other's consent, and especially shall not enter into any agreement that could affect the Eastern European Pact during the negotiations of the Eastern European Locarno Pact.

<h3>Saar Problem Comes to an End, League of Nations Begins Discussion of South-Hungarian Case</h3>
<p>French Foreign Minister Laval Acts as Mediator</p>
<p>Southern Representative's Speech is Surprisingly Moderate</p>
<p>(Geneva) Now that the Saar problem has come to an end, the eyes of the general public have now turned to Yugoslavia's application. From today, all parties have already begun to seek a fair way to resolve the dispute between South and Hungary. French Foreign Minister Laval continues to mediate, and he expressed optimism tonight.

<p>(Geneva) Today, the Council of the League of Nations convened a meeting to address Yugoslavia's accusation that Hungary was harboring accomplices in the Marseilles assassination. The speech given by South Foreign Minister Ivtić was moderate and unexpected. Mr. Ivtić only cited the events and the behavior of Hungarian officials. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council, originally scheduled to meet this morning to discuss Yugoslavia's application regarding the political responsibility for the Marseilles assassination incident, has been postponed to 3 PM this afternoon. Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya arrived in Geneva last night and held talks with representatives of major countries. As for the presentation of the South Foreign Minister Yevdić at the Council meeting this afternoon, he will explain that Yugoslavia's application is not a political lawsuit between Yugoslavia and Hungary, but is necessary to restore faith in the inherent order. Yevdić will also list various evidences of Hungary's responsibility for terrorist acts and demand that the League of Nations fulfill its duty to safeguard peace. Next, Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu will present the opinions of the Little Entente countries. Then, the Hungarian representative Eckhardt will present Hungary's response. It is reported that Hungary, after the gentle persuasion of Britain and Italy, has decided to postpone the publication of its reply to Yugoslavia's application until tomorrow. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Southern Country Expels Hungarian Overseas Chinese, Hungarian Government Protests</h3>
<p>Two Thousand Refugees Wander at the Border with Nowhere to Go</p>
<p>Penniless, the Old and Weak Wailing, the Scene is Tragic</p>
<p>The Hungarian overseas Chinese expelled from South Ge-te have gathered in the border town of Ge-te in the past two days, and their total number has reached 1,308 men, women, and children. The scene this morning was unbearable. These drifters are temporarily residing in schools and hospitals to wait for transportation elsewhere. These people are thinly clothed, penniless, and carry only scattered furniture. Many are weak old men who have lived in the South for many years. There is a 14-year-old child with a broken leg, crying loudly to find his parents who were lost in the chaos. The remaining border stations are also full of helpless refugees waiting for the Hungarian government to transport them elsewhere by train. The South authorities have cut off the supply of vehicles. The Hungarian government has protested to the South government and asked European powers to pay attention to this matter. According to the refugees, the South military along the border has been transferred inland because these people are eager to attack Hungarian territory.</p>
<p>The Hungarian capital recently reported by the Hungarian Telegraphic Correspondence that a large number of Hungarians are being expelled by Yugoslavia and have arrived at the border. So far, Si-shi-te City has received 1,184 people, and Beike-shi City has received 214 people. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>According to a Reuters reporter in Belgrade, the South National Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an article stating that the expulsion of Hungarian overseas Chinese is reasonable and lawful. The South government, due to the serious problem of domestic unemployment, coupled with Hungary's attitude in Geneva and the Hungarian authorities' cancellation of the passports of hundreds of South nationals residing in Hungary, has decided not to renew the passports of 27,000 Hungarians working in the South territory. It also stated that this action has not caused any particular difficulty. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>It is rumored from the Yugoslav capital that Yugoslav troops are concentrating on the Hungarian border. The Yava-la News Agency here officially denies this statement, saying that not only are Yugoslav troops not concentrating on the Hungarian border, but the Yugoslav troops originally stationed on the border have been reduced by 50% due to Christmas holidays. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>According to Hungarian sources in Ge-te Town, the South military stationed on the border is now crossing into Hungarian territory in an attempt to incite an incident. According to the Little Entente Treaty, if there is evidence that Hungary has committed an act of aggression, France will assist the South. According to Hungarian opinion, the South is now planning to create this situation. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>International Police Force Enters the Saar, Germany's Reply Expresses Approval</h3>
<p>Organized by Britain, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, etc.</p>
<p>The Number is at Most Two Thousand, Excluding Russia and Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the dispatch of an international army to the Saar region to maintain law and order during the plebiscite, the German government submitted a reply to A-le-ya-xi, chairman of the Saar problem trio committee, at 6 p.m. tonight, stating, "When the League of Nations Council held a meeting yesterday, the German government has read the declaration issued by the representatives of various countries regarding the maintenance of law and order in the Saar region during the plebiscite. In the opinion of the German government, the security of the Saar does not necessarily have to be maintained by foreign troops, but if the Council of the League of Nations decides to send a small international army composed of neutral countries to the Saar, the German government also expresses its agreement." People here generally say that the German reply has brought the international stage of the Saar problem to an end. (Meaning that what remains is only the plebiscite, which is an internal problem of the Saar). The Council of the League of Nations may hold a meeting tomorrow morning to file the compromise on the issue of maintaining Saar's security. The establishment of this compromise is due to the proposal of French Foreign Minister Laval. Several British and Italian military officers will arrive here tomorrow to liaise with the agencies under the Council to organize the international army. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) According to Geneva sources, although the German letter approved the dispatch of neutral international troops to the Saar, it believed that the current situation in the Saar did not require the use of foreign troops. When the German Consul in Geneva handed over this letter, he told the Secretary-General of the League of Nations that Germany had received guarantees from the governments of Britain and Italy. The so-called guarantees probably refer to Germany's concerns about the use of Russian troops, Czech troops, and the stationing of foreign troops in the Saar. According to reliable sources, Soviet Russia and Czechoslovakia have not requested to participate.</p>
<p>According to public opinion, an international police force of 1,500 to 2,000 people will be sufficient, and the members of this police force will be from Britain, Belgium, and Italy, because these three countries are all signatories to the Security Convention in the area. It is heard that the Netherlands has been invited and is expected to agree. In any case, this matter depends on the Saar Management Committee, and it is believed that the Committee will immediately start the organization plan of the international police force for the general assembly of citizens. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) People in the League of Nations believe that Sweden and the Netherlands may be invited to send a small team to join the UK and Italy to form an international army to enter the Saar to maintain order. These people also believe that the UK will send two battalions of infantry, and Italy will send two battalions of cavalry. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>The report of the Saar Tripartite Committee has now been passed by the entire Council of the League of Nations, and both France and Germany have approved of Britain's cooperation in maintaining order during the plebiscite, and both have stated that they do not want to participate in the international army, so one thing that needs to be resolved later is the concrete methods that should be adopted during and after the plebiscite to maintain order.</p>
<p>The British Knox, chairman of the Saar Management Committee, told the Council of the League of Nations yesterday that his current limited police force cannot guarantee that he can maintain order in an emergency. If an international army is stationed in the territory in advance, the Management Committee feels that order can be maintained, and the voting conference and the difficult times thereafter will definitely pass safely.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Laval told the Council of the League of Nations that the Saar procedure is not French, nor German, but for the League of Nations, so he said that the Council must be responsible for deciding what can maintain order. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Simon Reports to the House of Commons</h3>
<p>Praises the Spirit of Cooperation of the Countries Concerned</p>
<p>Dispatching Troops Together is Beneficial to the UK</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Minister Simon announced this afternoon in a crowded House of Commons that good news had been received that the problem of dispatching police to maintain order during the Saar plebiscite had been resolved in principle. Simon spoke for a long time, praising the work of the tripartite committee in agreeing on recommendations that had been accepted by both France and Germany, and praising the spirit of cooperation shown by countries with immediate relations with the future of the Saar. Simon said that the British government has always held the view that if disturbances occur during or after the Saar plebiscite, it is not appropriate for France to be the only country to provide external assistance. A few days ago, British representative Eden had offered cooperation. I can now happily tell you that I have received a reply from the German government, which states that the German government believes that it is very beneficial to have international troops stationed in the Saar before and after the Saar plebiscite. It also said that the German government approves of the condition that France and Germany do not join this army. I can also announce that Italy is also willing to undertake cooperation under the same conditions as the British government. The British government is currently in contact with several countries. French Foreign Minister Laval immediately expressed his agreement. I hope that everything I have said will satisfy the House of Commons, because the British government is handling this matter with due consideration for British interests, and also has the firmest intention to ensure the orderly conduct of the plebiscite under the authority of the League of Nations. Maintaining its order is the responsibility of the League of Nations, and the United Kingdom, under the guidance of the League of Nations, should also fulfill its proper obligations. After Simon's speech, everyone cheered, and Labor Party leader Lansbury and Liberal Party member Foote also congratulated the Foreign Minister. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>US Replies to the League of Nations Regarding the Chaco Dispute Mediation</h3>
<p>Refuses to Participate in the Work of the Advisory Committee</p>
<p>Paraguayan Troops Continuously Occupy Bolivian Fortresses, the Momentum is Like a Broken Bamboo</p>
<p>(Washington) The League of Nations' Advisory Committee for the mediation of the Chaco dispute had also invited the United States government to participate in cooperation. The United States government has recently replied, saying that the United States will not participate in the work of the Advisory Committee for the Chaco dispute, because the United States is not a member of the League of Nations, but the United States will send a Consul General stationed in Geneva to continue to have formal contact with the Advisory Committee and, when necessary, order him to notify the United States government at any time. On the contrary, the United States has accepted to participate in the Neutral Country Committee monitoring the ceasefire between Ba-Bo, and the arbitration meeting in the capital of Argentina. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Asunción Today, it is expected here that the Paraguayan army will drive straight in and may soon invade the Bolivian mainland. In the past two days, the Paraguayan army has repeatedly captured five gun emplacements, and two more are about to be captured. The fall of the five gun emplacements was like cutting rotten weeds. It is said that the Dao-bie-ni gun emplacement and the Ke-ke-lun gun emplacement have also been broken, but this news has not yet been confirmed. If this is the case, Vila-Montes may fall within 48 hours, and a major invasion of Bolivian territory will occur. The Bolivian army has completely lost its fighting spirit and has repeatedly abandoned its positions, leaving weapons and firearms everywhere. The Paraguayan army, under the command of General Ais-tai-ge-la, has advanced 60 miles and now surrounds the strategic location of Vila-Montes on three sides, which is the gateway to the Chaco oil area. Newspapers in Asunción reported that the Bolivian army, due to political turmoil, lacks the support of the government and also lacks weapons, and is on the verge of rebellion. The Paraguayan army will launch a general attack on Vila-Montes at any time and will surely win, because it is believed here that the Bolivian army has been surrounded on three sides, lacks both food and weapons, and can only support it for at most one or two days.

<h3>French Foreign Minister's Tour of Italy May Not Be Far Away</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The negotiations between the French and Italian representatives in Geneva have made considerable progress. It is expected that French Foreign Minister Laval may visit Rome soon.

Afterwards, Laval and Mussolini looked forward to meeting each other, and it was quite eager. At present, the spirit of compromise between the French and Italian representatives in Geneva is indeed a prelude to this meeting. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<h3>Göring Declares Irrelevance in the German Parliament Arson Case</h3>
<p>The French Newspaper's Report is Completely Fabricated</p>
<p>(Berlin) On Tuesday, the Paris Daily published an alarming document proving that the burning of the German Parliament was tacitly approved by Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Prussian Prime Minister Göring. Today, Göring's secretary declared that Ernst's statement was completely false. General Göring does not want to defend this matter, because there are many rumors fabricated by enemies outside, and it is really impossible to defend against them. According to the document, it was personally signed by Ernst, the leader of the Berlin Stormtroopers who was shot during the National Socialist purge movement in June of this year, proving that the fire in the Parliament was tacitly approved by the Second Ge, hoping to destroy the credibility of the Communist Party and consolidate the power of the National Socialist Party.

<h3>US Senator Announces Arms Transferred from Europe to China</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Clark made a statement today at the Senate Arms Investigation Committee, saying that there is really no need for war to occur in the world unless it is for the benefit of arms manufacturers. In 1929, a certain company disregarded the government's ban on the transportation of arms to China and shipped a batch of gunpowder to the Netherlands, and then transshipped it to China. The company knew that this batch of gunpowder would eventually be transported to China, but because the government had no right to prohibit transportation to the Netherlands, it rashly started shipping in order to be opportunistic. In addition, Clark also mentioned the issue of the United States selling 20 million bullets to Bolivia between 1933 and 1934, saying that Paraguay only purchased 10,000 bullets from the United States, and the rest was supplied by manufacturers in Britain and Germany. At this point, Clark then presented a letter from a certain US arms company to its representative in Chile, which read: "Regarding the issue of arms embargo, we have contacted important official figures, and we can fully justify and eliminate this unconscious move, etc." (Havas, 6th)</p>

<h3>The Chinese New School of Painting's Show of English Brilliance Opens to the Public</h3>
<p>(London) One hundred fifty to two hundred pieces of Chinese new school paintings, which had been exhibited in Rome, Milan, Berlin, and Paris with the assistance of the respective governments and greatly admired by the audience, have now been shipped from Europe to the Chinese Legation here. Among them are works by fifteen Chinese famous painters such as Liu Haisu. The French government recently purchased one of Liu's paintings. The Chinese Minister, Guo Taiqi, is now preparing to organize an influential committee to hold an exhibition at the New Burlington Galleries at the beginning of the New Year. Recently, after the premiere of Mr. Xiong's adaptation of the Chinese ancient drama "Wang Baochuan" at the Little Theatre, it aroused the interest of the British people in Chinese art. Therefore, this painting exhibition is guaranteed to achieve beautiful results. It is currently being discussed to invite the Duchess of Connaught to officiate at the opening ceremony, because the Duke has had previous connections with China. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>Bao Yueqing is About to Go to the Temple for a Trip</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to Bao Yueqing, the representatives sent to Beijing, Buda Dalai and Chen Shaowu, are still staying in Beijing. The gifts promised by Chiang Kai-shek have been received. There is no report yet on when the representatives will return north. Staying in Beijing is to prepare for Chiang's inquiries on Mongolian affairs. It is said that Prince De and Wang Ye presented Chiang with fine horses, which will be selected and transported to Beijing immediately. Because the Mongolian Political Council's address is inconvenient for office work, it is planned to move it elsewhere, which can be realized next year. I, myself, will go to the temple to pay my respects and report to Prince De, who has already returned to the temple, in three to five days and ask for instructions on everything. I will probably be delayed for more than ten days before returning to Ping. The central government is currently investigating the whereabouts of the Han Fenglin case, which is very gratifying to the Mongolian compatriots. They still hope that this case will be thoroughly investigated and the truth will be announced to comfort the Mongolian people. (Special Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>New York: The New York rubber market opened down 5 pounds. Since then, the ups and downs are mixed, and the transactions are very small.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>New York: Before the opening of the New York stock market, the factors favorable to the market situation are (1) Although the stock market is now consolidating its position, there is no sign of loss of confidence. (2) The demand of investors and speculators is expected to remain unsatisfied. (3) Cooperation between the business community and the government is expected to eventually revive commerce. (4) The amount of bank bill exchanges this week has increased compared to the previous week. The unfavorable factors for the market situation are that there is a wait-and-see and suspicious atmosphere in the market regarding railway stocks, fearing that the railway freight volume report will not be satisfactory. The stock market may therefore suffer setbacks. The stock market opened this morning, with flat trading and mixed prices. The ups and downs are limited to single-digit numbers, and the sentiment is still good, but the market price does not seem to fluctuate much at one time. The market prices are as follows:</p>

<h3>The Full Text of Guo Taiqi's Speech at the 15th Session of the League of Nations Assembly</h3>
<p>Declaring China's Position on the Northeast Issue</p>
<p>On September 14th of this year, when the 15th session of the League of Nations Assembly in Geneva was held, Guo Taiqi, the Chief Representative of our country and Minister to the United Kingdom, stood up and delivered a speech after the Secretary-General Dr. Avenol (Representative of Czechoslovakia) presented the annual report, claiming to speak in the capacity of the League of Nations Far East Rapporteur. He detailed the situation caused by Japan's armed occupation of Manchuria and several provinces in the Far East of China, and at the same time announced China's stance and attitude in abiding by the League of Nations' resolution on the Lytton Report. A summary of his speech was published in this newspaper on September 15th. Yesterday, the Shanghai China Press published the full text, which we have translated as follows:</p>
<p>Minister Guo said, "It is not merely a formality to extend congratulations to the Secretary-General for presenting his first annual report since taking office. He elaborated on the fate of the League of Nations in its most critical year. He sees the League of Nations regaining its prestige and emerging from this year. The despair that recently led one or two countries to abandon the League of Nations in search of solutions has now made the whole world realize that the soundness and stability of international cooperation can only lie within the framework of the League of Nations. China supports this renewed global sentiment without any reservations. The Chinese delegation, in the name of one-fifth of the world's people, in the name of one of the governments with the longest history of national administration, and in the name of the largest force in Asia, welcomes the clear signs of the restored power of the League of Nations. However, China does not hold excessive optimism, just as it despises excessive pessimism. In his opening address to the Assembly, Mr. Avenol spoke eloquently about the current situation in the world. I cannot hope to match Mr. Avenol's extensive knowledge and clear insights, but I must strive to compete with his pragmatic realism and focus on the points in the world situation that are most relevant to the Far East and that the Chinese government believes are most harmful to the future of world peace. Mr. Avenol's analysis of the situation draws attention to the hidden dangers of peace in the Far East. He said, "The current situation between China and Japan and the existing tensions between China and Russia are both particularly significant, and no one can deny this." My speech is not based on the position of one party in a dispute, but rather on the position of the League of Nations Far East Rapporteur, who must ask you for tolerance, and is based on the report accepted by all loyal members of the League of Nations regarding the nature and responsibility of the current tensions in the Far East. This report places the responsibility of paying close attention to the development of events in the Far East on the Assembly. The reason why I make these remarks is to assist us gathered here in fulfilling this responsibility. There are three main points that I would like to bring to the attention of the Assembly:</p>
<p>The first point is that the entire case is still open. The puppet installed by a certain foreign power in several provinces of Northeast China now calls himself emperor. This has not changed the nature of the armed occupation that violates the League of Nations Covenant. China only endures when it must endure. The League of Nations as a whole has passed its final judgment on this occupation. The League of Nations is still bound by its judgment. A year ago, when the Assembly opened its annual meeting, the Chinese representative stated that the Chinese government regards the situation in the four provinces as a fixed violation of the treaties, on which the security, disarmament, and peace of the world at large will depend. The Chinese government is determined to steadfastly maintain all its rights and demands and will never recognize or acquiesce to the fact created by the constitution. This kind of fact created by illegal means will only remain when China is unable to do so in terms of national strength or the rest of the League of Nations is unable to uphold the dignity of the treaties politically.</p>
<p>Our country holds this attitude because we believe that we have not only exhausted our helpless power to maintain the integrity of China's territory and political independence to resist Japanese aggression, but China's move is also aimed at resisting the attempt to transform the League of Nations Covenant into a mere scrap of paper. Subsequently, the Assembly adopted its unanimous report of February 24, 1933. China has strictly abided by the obligations contained in the various articles of the resolution in the report and fully expects the recommendations in the report to be implemented quickly without delay. In particular, with regard to the issue of non-recognition of the puppet state, China's attitude is firm and unwavering. China not only upholds this principle of non-recognition itself, but also believes that all countries in the League of Nations and other countries that have agreed to this principle have a responsibility to uphold it. Now, a certain distant country has formally recognized the illegal organization in Northeast China, although it is ambiguous. In fact, that country itself rarely has any direct contact with East Asian affairs. The circumstances of the recognition, as I have said, are still ambiguous. From China's standpoint as a member of the League of Nations, it regards this action as violating the League of Nations Covenant and as an event that the League of Nations should study and punish. Moreover, it believes that no other member state of the League of Nations will regard international justice with the same behavior, violating the provisions of the resolution in the unanimous report and its own solemn obligations listed in the report. This solitary incident is not worth mentioning, but in theory, it is very serious. The judgment of the League of Nations has maintained its inviolability to deal with actions that take the opportunity to induce destruction. This is indeed a great achievement. We Chinese are not unaware that some people are making efforts everywhere to stir up some ambiguity and hesitation in maintaining this inviolability. If they recently made unremitting attempts to threaten those who do not recognize the illegal system in that part of China with economic rectification and to make it difficult for their consuls stationed in Manchuria, to intimidate the countries bound by the Assembly's report, and to induce them to submit with special economic interests. Regarding this section, there are things that can be traced back. The Assembly's report not only obligates countries to recognize it in fact or in law, but also must not take any action that would facilitate the maintenance of the current illegal system. When the Advisory Committee of the Assembly interpreted this obligation, it stated that the governments of various countries cannot protect those who seek concessions from the custodians of the illegal system, because this illegal system disposes of China's state-owned property and commits the crime of high treason under international law. All claims based on this kind of opportunistic behavior can obviously not be recognized by China or any country bound by the Assembly's report. The Chinese government may file a lawsuit in any court of a country bound by the Assembly's report against those who enjoy concessions granted by the authorities in Manchuria who are destroying treaties, demanding compensation for losses. This is also an obvious fact.</p>
<p>The second point I would like to inform you is that the League of Nations has a continuous responsibility for this matter. This responsibility gradually increases with the increasing tension in the Far East situation and the growing hidden dangers to peace in the Far East. The refusal of any country to participate in the Geneva Conference does not affect this, because the League of Nations Covenant states that no country can terminate its membership in the League of Nations until its international obligations are fully fulfilled. This is not an unimportant provision, but a crucial and fundamental obligation. If any country can arbitrarily violate the Covenant and escape the pear of its withdrawal from the League of Nations, then the League of Nations as an instrument of peace will become a broken reed. The Assembly has solemnly declared that today's armed occupation of Manchuria is an act that violates the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The Assembly, as the defender of the League of Nations' honor, is responsible for drawing a clear conclusion on the basis of its own declaration and the provisions of the Covenant that I have just cited.</p>
<p>The third point I would like to ask you to pay attention to is the most important point, that is, the consequences of continuing to carry out treaty-breaking aggression in the Far East have now affected the whole world. The Assembly's report, which condemned this aggression and determined its responsibility, also stated that the continuation of the current system in Manchuria is incompatible with the maintenance of peace in the Far East. The Lytton Report also stated that any system that does not have the willing cooperation of the people of Manchuria cannot restore order and prosperity in that part of China, and that the people of Manchuria are now firmly opposed to the foreign military dictatorship that should be regarded as created by fraud and aggression. The facts have unfortunately proved how correct the Assembly's view of the situation created by the occupation of our northeastern provinces is. As of today, the situation has not improved at all and is even further away from what the League of Nations previously hoped for and decided on. In March of this year, the illegal organization actually declared itself an empire, and its puppet even usurped the title of emperor. Although this does not change the nature and status of the puppet state, the illegality of the case has reached a more dangerous degree. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Between the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteers and Japanese-Puppet Troops in Jidong</h3>
<p>Japanese-Puppet Troops Organize a Joint Force to Attack</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Volunteers Fight Fiercely in Their Respective Areas</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: Since the Japanese army forcibly occupied our Northeast, the people of our Northeast, although under great oppression, have never ceased their efforts to resist. Despite failures and sacrifices, their spirit has not been broken. Therefore, they press forward one after another, unyielding and indomitable. The situation this year is particularly intense. Although the network of roads built by the Japanese army is largely completed, allowing travel from morning to evening, the people of the Northeast are still fighting like trapped beasts in the midst of hardship, shattering the Japanese propaganda that "Manchukuo's public order has entered a safe period, and military operations have come to an end." This demonstrates the fighting spirit of our Chinese nation. Because of this, the Japanese army is restless day and night and considers the situation serious. They have taken large-scale mobilization actions to cope with it. In addition to the area along the Liaoning Eastern Border, where the Japanese Independent First Garrison Unit, in conjunction with puppet troops, is commanded by the Garrison Commander Miura and has begun attacking, recently, the Japanese Wakayama Division (Third Division), stationed in Harbin, has been the main force. It has drawn troops from the Tani Brigade of the Japanese Seventh Division stationed in Rehe, and the Shinohara and Kozhiba Regiments of the Sixteenth Division in Qiqihar, along with the entire First Army of the "Fengtian" Puppet Jing'an Guerrilla Force, to form a joint Japanese-puppet force. Corresponding to the Japanese-puppet troops stationed in the defense area, they have surrounded the area of activity of the Anti-Japanese Volunteers in the northeastern part of Jilin Province, allocated areas, and begun attacking. The Anti-Japanese Volunteers in various parts of northeastern Jilin Province, upon receiving the news, are all in high spirits, vowing to fight to the death with the Japanese-puppet troops. They have been in contact for several days. The deployment of the Japanese-puppet troops and their attacks on the Anti-Japanese Volunteers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Binjiang Area: The Three-Kai and Yasui Regiments belonging to the Japanese Third Division are taking a large encirclement formation against the elite units of the Anti-Japanese Volunteers led by Yu Haiyun (Jiujiang) and Zhao Shangzhi, and fierce battles are taking place in areas such as Yangshan (15 kilometers east of Wuchang County on the Labin Line), Mao'er Mountain (along the Hasui Line), Heilong Palace (southeast of the Bin Line), Tongbin (Yanshou), and other areas.</p>
<p>(2) Ning'an Area: The Japanese army, with the Tani Brigade and its subordinate regiments of the Seventh Division stationed in Rehe as the main force, is attacking the various Anti-Japanese Volunteer units in the Ning'an area. It has already engaged in a fierce battle with the forces linked to Chen Dongshan's unit in the western part of the Aimin Ninth Battalion at Nanhu Tou (Jingpo Lake).</p>
<p>(3) Eastern Area: The Japanese army, drawing elite Saito, Yoshiki, and Minamikosuge Regiments (combined to form a brigade or more in strength) from the Third, Seventh, and Sixteenth Divisions, is dividing into three routes, each taking one side, to attack the powerful Anti-Japanese Volunteer force led by Kong Xianrong, which is located near the Russian border. Their strategic plan is to use a siege formation and adopt a joint army-air force threat tactic to suppress Kong's force. However, Kong's force is very strong, and they have a considerable source of arms and ammunition, so they should be able to sustain the fight for a long time.</p>
<p>(4) Northern Area: The Japanese army in Yilan, Fangzheng, Jiamusi, and other places, with the Tamura Regiment, Abunzuku Detachment, and Kozhiba Detachment (all battalion-level), organized a joint attack against the Anti-Japanese Volunteer force led by Xie Wendong. They have already engaged in fierce battles in Changfa Tun, Banjie He, Taiping Gou, and other places. Two Japanese Second Lieutenants, Kajio and Matsuda, have been killed.</p>
<p>It is found that the Anti-Japanese Volunteers are very active in the northeastern part of Jilin, and there are three reasons why the Japanese-puppet troops are difficult to deal with: (1) Being close to the border, it is easy for the Anti-Japanese Volunteers to replenish their guns and ammunition, and even if they run out of ammunition and are cut off from supplies, there is still a source; (2) The local people are deeply stimulated by the confiscation of guns and land, and they clearly know the brutal face of the Japanese, so they are determined to resist Japan and secretly help the Anti-Japanese armed forces; (3) The northeastern part of Jilin is close to mountainous areas, and most of the land is large-scale silty fields. In this kind of place, only the natives who are familiar with the situation can pass through unhindered with skillful techniques, so the Japanese regard it as a daunting task, and transportation by cars, etc., is even more impossible. With these three reasons, the Anti-Japanese Volunteers can wage a protracted war. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Situation of Bandits in Sichuan and Hunan</h3>
<p>Internal Division Has Already Begun Among the Sichuan Bandits</p>
<p>The Focus of Bandit Suppression Will Be in Sichuan in the Future</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After Xu Xiangqian's bandit forces rampaged in northern Sichuan, bandit gangs in various places, feeling unable to survive under the pressure of the National Army, all thought about fleeing to Sichuan to join forces. In recent times, those who have abandoned their nests and fled westward, such as the Jiangxi bandits entering Hunan, and the bandits on the border of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Shanxi, are also plotting to enter Shaanxi, which is all evidence of this. The resurgence of the Sichuan bandits in Suixuan and the return of He Long and Xiao Ke to western Hunan also have a significant role in connecting with the westward fleeing of the Jiangxi bandits. The border area of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei will be the focus of future military operations to suppress bandits, and the area around Hankou is sufficient for control. As for the strength of the various bandit forces, Zhu Mao is rampaging with all his forces and is being surrounded and suppressed by the National Army on all sides, and their strength has become weak. The He and Xiao gangs are not the main force, and the Wu Huanxian gang has less than a thousand people, which is even less worth mentioning. Combining news from various sources: (1) Xu Xiangqian's gang occupies more than ten counties in northern Sichuan, such as Banan. Following the old tricks of the Jiangxi bandits, they established a puppet "Chinese Soviet Republic." Its highest military organ is the puppet "Northwest Revolutionary Military Commission," with Zhang Guotao as the puppet chairman. Under it are the puppet "Northwest Military Region Political Department," with Chen Changhao as the puppet director, the puppet "General Staff Department," with Ni Zhiliang as the puppet chief of staff, and the puppet "General Headquarters of the Northwest Military Region of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Army," with Xu Xiangqian as the puppet commander-in-chief and Wang Shulin as the puppet deputy commander-in-chief. Under it are five armies: the puppet Fourth Army, commanded by Wang Hongkun, commanding the Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Divisions, with the Twelfth Division as the main force, being the most elite among the armies; the puppet Ninth Army, commanded by He Wei, commanding the Twenty-fifth, Twenty-sixth, and Twenty-seventh Divisions; the puppet Thirtieth Army, commanded by Yu Tianyun, commanding the Eighty-eighth, Eighty-ninth, and Ninetieth Divisions; the puppet Thirty-first Army, commanded by Sun Yuqing, commanding the Ninety-first, Ninety-second, and Ninety-third Divisions, all with average combat capabilities; and the puppet Thirty-third Army, commanded by Wang Weizhou, commanding the Ninety-seventh and Ninety-eighth Divisions, with the weakest strength. Although the bandits possess this huge force, the cadres from Hubei and Henan have died almost completely, and those who have been replenished are all Sichuanese, so they are still easy to pacify. According to a recent Sichuan telegram, it is said that Xu, realizing that it would be difficult to succeed due to the disunity within the bandit gang, secretly sent representatives to express their sincerity to the central government and requested that troops be sent to Shaanxi to provide cover so that they could lead their troops to return. However, the plan was leaked and they were secretly executed by Chen Changhao and Zhang Guotao. In order to stabilize the bandits, they still claimed to the outside world that Xu was responsible for military affairs, but in reality, Zhang was in command. Although the truth of the matter cannot be determined, internal strife among the bandits is indeed possible. The recent actions of the Sichuan bandits are that the right wing mainly defends, with many fortifications built on the north bank of the Ba River, and the left wing mainly attacks, plotting to once again rampage in Suixuan, attempting to spy on Kui Wan. The Sichuan army is currently taking strict precautions. After Liu Xiang returns to Sichuan after meeting with Chiang Kai-shek, he will order a general suppression. The various troops stationed in [illegible] have already obeyed the order to cooperate in the suppression. Once the Sichuan army launches an attack, they will join forces to advance and suppress. (2) The puppet First, Third, Fifth, Eighth, and Ninth Army Corps of the Jiangxi bandits, unable to gain a foothold in Jiangxi, entered Sichuan via Hunan. One force has crossed Quanyong, and another force is trapped on the Guibian, and fierce battles have been raging for days, with no less than 20,000 bandits killed or captured. (3) The He Long and Xiao Ke gangs, entrenched in western Hunan, number about several thousand people. They are currently surrounded in Dayong by the Hubei army, the Hunan army, [illegible] Chen Quzhen's various units, and are still fleeing downwards very rapidly. (4) The Wu Huanxian gang, rampaging on the border of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, has been defeated by [illegible] and other units. They have less than a thousand people. They merged the puppet Twenty-eighth Army into the puppet Twenty-fifth Army. The puppet Northeast Road and its subordinate two puppet guerrilla divisions were also completely merged, and they were reorganized into the Seventy-fourth and Seventy-fifth Divisions. Now they have been reduced to the Seventy-fifth Division. The puppet commander was formerly sent by the Jiangxi bandits, and Xu Haidong is the puppet deputy commander. Wu has retreated to become the puppet commander and political commissar of the Seventy-fifth Division. They are still continuing to flee westward, but they are no longer a cause for concern.

<h3>Guangdong Province Holds Winter Defense</h3>
<p>Various Counties Formulate Winter Defense Measures for Implementation</p>
<p>Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Inspect Police Teams Throughout the Province</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: As winter defense is approaching, and the bandits on the border of Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong are currently being jointly encircled and suppressed, the public order in the interior of Guangdong Province is important. The authorities have instructed various pacification district offices to issue orders to their subordinate counties and cities to hold winter defense preparedness to prevent petty thieves and bandits from mixing in. The various counties, upon receiving the order, have formulated winter defense measures separately and are implementing them uniformly. The guard office of the headquarters, in order to inspect the guard teams of various counties, assess their performance, and inspect the situation of their deployment, has dispatched supervisory commissioners to inspect the districts in daytime. According to the terrain of the various counties in the province, it has been divided into sixteen supervisory areas for guard teams. One supervisory commissioner is assigned to each area to inspect the counties on a rotating basis. The supervisory commissioners are rotated every six months. The supervisory commissioners have been successively appointed, and the delineation of the supervisory areas is as follows: (First District) Nanhai, Sanshui, Huaxian, Qingyuan, Fogang, Conghua; (Second District) Panyu, Shunde, Baoan, Dongguan, Zengcheng, Longmen; (Third District) Zhongshan, Xinhui, Taishan, Chixi, Kaiping, Enping; (Fourth District) Huiyang, Heyuan, Boluo, Zijin, Haifeng, Lufeng; (Fifth District) Xinfeng, Lianping, Heping, Longchuan, Wuhua, Xingning; (Sixth District) Raoping, Dapu, Fengshun, Meixian, Pingyuan, Jiaoling; (Seventh District) Nanao, Chenghai, Chaoyang, Huilai, Puning, Jieyang, Chaoan; (Eighth District) Qujiang, Shixing, Nanxiong, Lechang, Renhua, Ruyuan, Wengyuan; (Ninth District) Yingde, Yangshan, Lianxian, Lianshan; (Tenth District) Sihui, Guangning, Heshan, Gaoyao, Gaoming, Xinxing; (Eleventh District) Yunfu, Deqing, Luoding, Yunan, Fengchuan, Kaijian; (Twelfth District) Yangjiang, Yangchun, Dianbai, Wuchuan, Maoming, Xinyi; (Thirteenth District) Huaxian, Lianjiang, Suixi, Haikang, Xuwen; (Fourteenth District) Hepu, Lingshan, Qinxian, Fangcheng; (Fifteenth District) Qiongshan, Chengmai, Lingao, Danxian, Changjiang, Ganen; (Sixteenth District) Wenchang, Anding, Qiongdong, Lehui, Wanning, Lingshui, Yaxian.

<h3>Implementation of Feast Tax in Beiping</h3>
<p>Over Two Thousand Yuan Collected in a Short Period</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the abolition of miscellaneous levies in Beiping, the market has shown a slight recovery, but government expenses and all construction costs have become tight. The municipal government has levied a feast tax in an attempt to make up for this. The intention is to raise funds while curbing extravagance and waste. The tax has been in effect for twenty days, and the amount collected has reached a huge sum of over two thousand yuan. The citizens' monthly expenses for socializing and entertainment, as evidenced by this, are quite shocking. According to Wang Yinhuai, the director in charge of this tax, the process and current situation of the tax are briefly described as follows: "The feast tax in this city is an innovation, so since our office has undertaken the special levy, we have taken many things into consideration. The funds advanced for the undertaking are not small, and the difficulty of promotion is still felt to be thorny. When the municipal government promulgated the regulations, the guild of restaurant operators initially requested exemption, and then refused to collect on their behalf. It was not until November 8 that the implementation was slightly in order. Furthermore, due to sending personnel to distribute joint orders and various procedures, it was not until November 10 that it was truly the first day of collection. In the first ten days of November, the collection had not yet begun, so there was no income. In the middle ten days, a total of cash and arrears were collected, deducting 5% of the cost for collection on behalf, the actual donation of foreign money amounted to two thousand six hundred thirty-six yuan, three corners and six cents, which is the result of the total collection of each household up to today."

<h3>Impersonating Inspectors to Rob Under the Pretext of Inspecting Soil in Songjiang</h3>
<p>In Chenjia Hang, Twenty-eighth Tu, in this county, at the home of villager Dai Mao Gou, at about 8 p.m. on the third of this month, someone claimed to be carrying out important business on the orders of the district head, tricked them into opening the gate, and four people entered. Each wore a military cap, uniform, and carried a flashlight and pistol. Zhang Mingshan, who was among those who came, was familiar with the victim and claimed to be there on orders to investigate their trafficking of soil and morphine. The four people searched separately and stole seventeen pieces of cloth, five silver dollars, one paper dollar, and clothing, etc., before leaving. On the fifth, the victim encountered Zhang Mingshan on the road and immediately handed him over to the Sixth Sub-station, asking for him to be dealt with according to the law. He was sent to the general bureau today. According to Dai Mao Gou's confession, he witnessed Zhang Mingshan committing the robbery, but Zhang Mingshan said that he farmed more land than Dai Mao Gou, so how could he commit a robbery? Their confessions differed, so they will be sent to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Travelers Commit Double Suicide by Poisoning in Suzhou's First Inn</h3>
<p>Yesterday (7th) at 10 a.m., in room 32 of the First Inn outside Lümen, a traveler using the alias Wang Ru Yuan and a female guest Chen Si Bao (real name Gu Si Bao) both committed suicide by poisoning. After the tea attendant discovered this, he reported it to the police, and they were sent to Suyong Hospital for treatment. After Dr. Gu Suyong performed surgery, they are now out of danger, and their lives can be saved. The reporter visited at 12 o'clock, and their minds were clear. According to them, Wang Ru Yuan is his alias, and his real name is Zhang Rui Xian, 27 years old, a local, living at No. 9, Yinfeng Bridge Lane, Shengjia Dai. At the age of seventeen, he became an apprentice at Duanmu Xiang Store, Lianxi Fang in the city. At the age of twenty-two, he was laid off. Through a friend's introduction, he entered the Boxi Hospital in Tianci Zhuang, working as a registrar. He resigned this year in July due to a marriage incident. He met her (Gu Si Bao) in February of this year. They decided to marry each other through friendship. Because her parents did not agree, they could not fulfill their wishes, so they agreed to escape to Wuxi together on July 27 and live together. The eighty yuan they brought out has all been used up. On the fourth, they returned to Suzhou and went to Gu Si Bao's house, but were rejected again. Because of economic pressure and a lack of freedom, they sought death by poisoning. She (Gu Si Bao) is 22 years old, living at No. 12, Zhangjia Lane, Yanzhi Bridge. She has parents and siblings at home. She usually worked at the Zhenfeng Cloth Factory on Shiquan Street. Because they were in love, but not free, they committed suicide together. Now they deeply regret their mistake, etc.</p>

<h3>Autopsy Conducted Yesterday in Wuxi's Female Maid Suicide Case</h3>
<p>After Zhou Yufen, a female maid at the home of Dr. Zhu Daji, a surgeon in Yangting, was fired by Zhu, she committed suicide by poisoning at No. 43, Park Hotel, and died. The mother of the deceased, Zhou Qu, begged Zhu's family for money to buy a coffin, but was beaten by Zhu's wife and falsely accused of colluding with the tea attendant Tan Genfa to extort money. She was handed over to the local branch for questioning. The prosecutor Lian opened a court to interrogate her. Zhou Qu requested in court that justice be done for her daughter. As a result of the legal autopsy, the court ordered Zhu Daji to be released on bail. Zhou Qu, Zhou He Bao, Zhou Yu Ying, Zhou Xu, Tan Genfa, and others were all ordered to return home. Yesterday (7th) at 10 a.m., the prosecutor Lian, leading the coroner Liu and two bailiffs, took a streetcar to the hostel guild hall. He ordered the undertaker to carry Yufen's body out of the morgue. The coroner Liu performed a legal autopsy. The autopsy revealed that Yufen's entire body was red and swollen, and her fingers and gums were cyanotic. There were several rat bites on her left ear and left fingers. There were several needle marks on both arms from doctors. There were no other abnormalities. It was determined that she had died by poisoning while alive. After the autopsy, he ordered the family of the deceased to prepare a coffin for burial. During the autopsy, Zhou Qu cried bitterly and fainted. Her daughter, Yu Ying, tried her best to wake her up, and the scene was very tragic. It was also heard that the reason for Zhou Yufen's suicide was not due to being fired by Zhu's family. Therefore, the inside story of this case is quite complicated.</p>

<h3>Robbery and Assault Occurs in Changzhou, Near the Outer City</h3>
<p>At the home of Gu Genlin in Longku Village, near the outer city of Wuyi First District, at about 1 a.m. on the 5th, more than ten bandits suddenly came, carrying flashlights and sharp weapons. They passed through the wooden planks from the west and smashed through the back door to enter the house. First, they went to Genlin's bedroom, tied Genlin up, and burned his head with fire, forcing him to reveal where he had hidden his money. Then, they rummaged through the boxes and cabinets, stealing more than 300 silver dollars and more than 30 pieces of clothing. After about an hour, they escaped with the stolen goods. On the 6th, the village chief of the village, Wan Jianming, reported the incident to the First District Office, which reported it to the county government for investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Coal Shop in Zhoujing, Changshu</h3>
<p>Zhoujing Town, Second District, in this county, is located along the Xuliujing River Estuary and is a large market. The market was originally very lively, but due to the drought this year, the market is sluggish. At about 12 p.m. the night before last, more than ten bandits suddenly came to the home of Ma Sanbao, who runs a coal shop on the east side of the town, and robbed the house. Ma's wife did not have time to escape and was immediately kidnapped by the bandits and escaped towards Hupukou.

<h3>Numerous Disputes Arise in Jingjiang Over River Dredging</h3>
<p>The river bordering Jingjiang has been dredged, disputes have arose one after another. Guo Dechao, the director of the Juyi branch office, has ulterior motives. He first moved the lime piles without authorization and encroached on the border. Our branch office reported this to the county government, and the county heads of the two counties, along with Sun Yunxia, a member of the Department of Civil Affairs, went to re-hammer the stakes, and the storm subsided. Director Guo's plan did not succeed, and he later forcibly destroyed the only bridge connecting the two counties, the West Plank Bridge. This bridge had been decided by the two counties to be destroyed and rebuilt after the river dredging was completed. Now Guo has forcibly destroyed it in violation of the order, which has caused another storm, and all river dredging has been stopped. Our county head Li has telegraphed the special commissioner's office to send an engineer to supervise the work as soon as possible to avoid disputes from arising from time to time.</p>
<h3>Village Head Commits Murder in Qingjiang</h3>
<p>In Langshi Town, Nanxin Di, Fourth District of Huaiyin, a farmer surnamed Li had an argument with Wang Yinhuai, the village head, on the 3rd. It is unknown how it provoked Wang's anger, but he took out a box gun from his home and shot to death a man in the Li family and a woman. Then he escaped. Afterwards, the Li family and the brothers of the woman Li An were very indignant and went to the county government to report the case and request an inspection and ask for the murderer to be brought to justice. Today, the county government sent many people to investigate. For a time, the neighbors all cried out for justice for the Li family and helped to move Wang Yinhuai's food and supplies to sell to provide the Li family with burial expenses for the deceased, in order to vent public anger.</p>
<h3>Party Committee Being Sued in Haimen, Investigation in Suzhou</h3>

<h3>Head of Chongde Relief Center Being Sued</h3>
<p>Since becoming head of the Chongde County Relief Center in 1918, Ma Yixin has not announced any income or expenditure, which has caused criticism. Last year, Hua Zhenxin and others, standing committee members of the Chongde Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai, successively reported to the county government and the Zhejiang Department of Civil Affairs. The province repeatedly instructed a thorough investigation, but the case remained unresolved. It is now heard that the Department of Civil Affairs has instructed the Chongde County Government to investigate. At the same time, the Chongde Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai has also requested the Chongde County Government to order all judicial bodies in Chongde to immediately organize a liquidation committee and allow members of the Chongde Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai to join in order to ensure fairness.

<h3>The Central Government's Finances Can Safely Pass the End of the Year</h3>
<p>News from Banking Circles in This City</p>
<p>According to news from banking circles in this city from the Central News Agency, since Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi took office, he has worked diligently on increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. The income and expenditure can now be balanced. However, it is inevitable that there will be some difficulties at the end of each year. But for this year, there is no problem with the central government's finances. The Ministry of Finance has sold the stamp tax to the China Construction Bank Corporation at a 93% discount, obtaining a total of 30 million yuan. This amount is more than enough to safely pass the end of this year. Furthermore, since the Ministry of Finance increased the silver export tax and equalization tax, silver exports have virtually ceased. As for tax evasion and smuggling, the Ministry of Finance has joined forces with military and police agencies to strictly prevent it. Therefore, the money market has gradually eased. Yesterday, the interbank lending rate was 23%.</p>

<h3>Fenghua Fellow Villagers Association Cables Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting Disaster Relief for Zhejiang</p>
<p>This year, the drought in Zhejiang has affected 47 counties, with nearly 2.5 million victims. The old, weak, women, and children are suffering from hunger and cold, and are wandering everywhere. The situation is too terrible to bear. Currently, as it is the dead of winter, the situation is becoming more serious. Citizens from all counties in Zhejiang have telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, pleading for the relief of their hometowns and disaster victims, and requesting the Zhejiang Provincial Government to release the one million relief funds allocated from provincial bonds as soon as possible to benefit the disaster victims. Yesterday, Mr. Wu Zhihao of the Fenghua Fellow Villagers Association also telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting the simultaneous organization of emergency relief and work relief. The original telegram is recorded below: "Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Sir: The drought in Zhejiang this year is extremely severe. According to investigation reports, 47 counties are disaster areas with over 2.5 million disaster victims who cannot survive without relief. The majority are old, weak, women, and children, suffering from hunger and cold, wandering everywhere. Grass roots and tree bark have been exhausted, and people are starving to death and committing suicide in increasing numbers. The current situation in the disaster area is too terrible to bear. They are crying for food and urgently hoping for relief. Collecting relief funds is a drop in the bucket. The counties are sending urgent requests, and the relief personnel have no rice to cook. The Zhejiang Relief Conference has decided to allocate one million from the Zhejiang Provincial Bonds to provide emergency relief first, saving the disaster victims who are old, weak, women, and children from dying by sunset, and then organize work relief, enabling the strong to replace relief with labor and build a foundation for fundamental disaster relief. You, sir, care about your hometown and have compassion for the disaster victims. Please immediately telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to organize emergency relief and work relief simultaneously. The disaster victims in Zhejiang will be fortunate to have a day of revival. All of this will be your everlasting merit. We earnestly hope for your telegram as much as a severe drought hopes for clouds. On behalf of the disaster victims, we respectfully offer incense and pray. We eagerly await your instructions." Wu Zhihao of the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association of Fenghua bows.</p>

<h3>Pan-Pacific Association Welcomes British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen for a Speech</h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting and Wu Tiecheng Deliver Speeches in Succession</p>
<p>Advocating that China Urgently Needs Unity and Cooperation</p>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, the Pan-Pacific Association welcomed British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen at the Astor House Hotel on the 6th. In his speech, the British Ambassador stated that China's situation has gradually stabilized in the past year, and various constructions are gradually being completed. In the future, it is even more necessary to learn from the strengths of others to make up for one's own shortcomings in order to achieve prosperity. The details of the day are translated and recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendees: The attendees that day were mostly celebrities in Shanghai, including Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, Zhang Gongquan, Du Yuesheng, Li Ming, Lin Kanghou, Song Ziliang, etc.</p>
<p>Wang and Wu Deliver Speeches: After the meeting began, Wang Zhengting first delivered an introductory speech, stating briefly that the relationship between China and Britain is extremely close. Although Britain is far from the East, it has many colonies in the Pacific, so the relationship is quite deep. This time, Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen has done an excellent job in allocating the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds, so that China can receive practical assistance in various fields such as shipping, education, and railways. Wu then delivered a welcoming speech, saying that he was very grateful for Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's presence this morning. The Chinese people have a deeper faith in the British Ambassador after his return from inspecting the South. This belief is that both China and Britain will obtain closer friendship under Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's efforts. The British Ambassador has recently inspected various parts of China and has a thorough understanding of the construction efforts in various parts of China. As for the construction work in Shanghai, it is only a small part of the whole country. In the future, the Chinese government is striving to actively develop the national construction undertaking.</p>
<p>Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's Speech: I have been in China for a short time and have not seen much. I have not been able to gain a deep understanding of the situation in China. What I can say today is only what I know from my personal experience and offer it as a contribution. When I first arrived in China, the situation in the Far East had become stable. I firmly believe that it will become more and more peaceful in the future. China's foreign diplomacy has not reached a serious stage this year. China internally is now relatively peaceful. During this peaceful period, the Chinese government can fully focus on domestic enrichment and construction. However, to achieve China's strength, it must make long-term efforts. What China should pay special attention to during this period is how to seek mutual cooperation with the international community. No country can achieve prosperity by breaking away from international relations. As for China internally, there is even more need for cooperation with the international community, because China cannot develop externally without first uniting internally. This point is not based on the concept of the state. This cooperation requires every member to contribute their personal strength to the country in order to achieve the health of the entire country. China's only cure is not to copy foreigners blindly. It should use its inherent spirit to extract the strengths of foreigners to make up for its own shortcomings. This is the significance of China's need to cooperate with the international community. I believe that any country will be happy to accept this. The current global recession is coming to an end. Although the British domestic economy has stabilized through the efforts of the British people, the future development of Britain cannot be achieved by Britain alone. It also needs the cooperation of other countries in order to achieve the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity.</p>
<p>Regarding worker donations, the General Labor Union has convened various labor unions to decide on the method of worker donations. Yesterday, it submitted a request to the Municipal Government to issue an order to all factories to set the 10th of this month as the worker donation movement. Workers who are paid by the day will have one day's wages deducted, and workers who are paid by the piece will have 50 cents deducted for fundraising. It is said that the Municipal Government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to quickly order compliance and post a public notice in the newspaper. The General Labor Union and various labor unions are expanding publicity and announcements.</p>
<p>Today is the day for the Boy Scouts to mobilize for general donations. It is hoped that all citizens, residents, and stores who pass by or reside in the city will enthusiastically donate to general donations, save the disaster, and save those in need. The merit is immeasurable. If you have already donated and have a receipt, you will not be asked to donate again. It is even more hoped that you can donate more.</p>
<h3>Various Provincial Drought Relief Conferences Decide on Relief Methods</h3>
<p>Taking Food Distribution as the Principle, the Society Will Directly Investigate and Distribute</p>

Should it be added? It was resolved to be added. (4) Mr. Zhang Yongni sent a letter stating that Qingjiang Congee Factory is doing a conscientious job. This year, due to the drought, there are many people who need food, and the price of rice is expensive. It is very difficult. Please allocate a sum of 1,000 or 2,000 yuan from the aviation funds to provide relief. It was resolved to allocate 1,000 yuan. Temporary proposals were then discussed, including: (1) Detailed investigation and distribution rules. It was decided that the investigation and distribution group would draft them. (2) Recognition of the design group's resolution. (A) Forward a letter to the Banking Association, urging all money shops to organize relief and loan departments in the disaster area.

The public bonds are to be kept and managed by the Relief Committee.</p>
<p>The relief method was passed yesterday. The original text of the investigation and emergency relief methods is as follows: (1) The standard for relief distribution is that the disaster-stricken area is 60% or more of the total. The standard is to be investigated by the Investigation Director of the Society in conjunction with the provincial governments and provincial relief committees, submitted to the Society for approval. The standard for beneficiaries is extreme poverty, being 50 years or older, 15 years or younger, or having disabilities and other conditions that make it impossible to survive without relief. (2) The Society will conduct the investigation and distribution directly. (3) The principle of relief distribution is food distribution, with each person receiving approximately 2 yuan of relief grain. If there is a need to increase or decrease the amount, the Investigation Director may make temporary adjustments and report to the Society. (4) Each province will have an Investigation Director, named Shanghai Fundraising Society for Drought Relief in Various Provinces, Investigation Director of a certain province (city). Under the Director, staff may be employed. Each county that should receive relief may have a county Investigation Director and staff. (5) Relief distribution will use the Society's relief tickets, stamped with the joint distribution mark of the Central Disaster Area Multi-Term Emergency Relief Committee. The person who distributes the relief supplies or relief funds by the Society shall use this relief ticket. (6) The Society shall send personnel to distribute relief and report to the central government to send personnel for supervision. (7) The relief procedures shall be the responsibility of the Investigation Director of the Society for investigation and ticket distribution. All relief supplies and relief funds shall be publicly distributed by the local government relief associations with the relief ticket, and the relief ticket shall be collected. The local government relief branches shall issue a certificate of proof and hand it over to the Investigation Director of the Society for transfer to the Society, which shall hand it over to the accountant for review. After the review, it shall be submitted to the central government and the Relief Committee of the National Government for record. (8) All internal expenses of the Society shall be raised separately and shall not use relief funds. As for the relief distribution expenses of each province (city), the expenses shall be cut from the relief funds according to the official and charity relief precedents. The proportion shall be specified in the detailed investigation and distribution rules. (9) After the Investigation Director of each province (city) receives the relief funds and supplies, he/she shall store them in the bank designated by the provincial government and provincial relief association when arriving at each province (city) and wait for distribution. The relief supplies shall be stored in a designated public storage area. (10) The Investigation Director of each province (city) shall, upon arrival at the location, formulate a concrete plan for relief distribution in the province (city) and the actual situation of the current relief work in conjunction with the provincial government and provincial relief association and submit it to the Society for verification, and report the daily work to the Society on a weekly basis. (11) Detailed investigation and distribution rules shall be formulated separately.</p>

<h3>National Economic Commission Repairs Ningxia Water Conservancy</h3>
<p>Appropriates 200,000 Yuan to Dredge the Yunting Canal</p>
<p>Irrigates 600,000 Mu of Land, Can Establish Another County</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency in Shanghai, the National Economic Commission is repairing Ningxia water conservancy. The 15th Route Army soldiers are dredging the Yunting Canal. According to a report from the technical personnel stationed in Ningxia by the Water Conservancy Department of the Commission, the 15th Route Army soldiers are excavating the Yunting Canal. The canal mouth to Wangzhuang is divided into seven sections. The first and second sections each have 1,500 soldiers, the third and fourth sections each have 1,600 soldiers, the fifth section has 1,500 soldiers, the sixth section has 1,800 soldiers, and the seventh section has 2,200 soldiers, totaling 11,700 soldiers. They started working along the line from the 1st of this month, starting work at 7:00 AM every day, having lunch at 12:00 noon, and stopping work for dinner at 5:00 PM. When there is moonlight, they work at night for two or three hours. The regimental commanders personally supervise them. All officers and soldiers are able to work bravely and without slackening. Therefore, they have completed the work in a short period of time. The first section was completed on the 28th of this month, the second section was completed on the 21st, the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth sections were completed on the 18th, and the seventh section was completed on the 20th. All construction plans are formulated by the Construction Department in accordance with the rules of the National Economic Commission, and personnel are sent to each section to be responsible for guidance. As for the section from Wangzhuang to the end of the canal, the work must be continued next spring because the weather is too cold now. The canal's expenses, excluding the soldiers, are only 200,000 yuan allocated by the National Economic Commission. After the canal is completed, it can irrigate approximately 600,000 mu of land and can establish another county.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning, the Beifu Collided with the Hua'an in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Hua'an Enters Factory for Repairs</p>
<p>This Matter Has Already Concluded</p>
<p>The Northern Shipping Company's Beifu, originating from North China, arrived in Shanghai and docked at the Datong Wharf in the southern section of the Huangpu River to unload cargo. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, the cargo having been cleared, it needed to head to the Zhoujiadu Wharf in Pudong to load cargo. It immediately departed from Datong Wharf and began to turn its hull. Unexpectedly, an unfortunate incident occurred.</p>
<p>To Avoid a Ferry, the Captain of the Beifu Was a White Russian Named Guxin Cuofu. As the ship turned, he noticed a ferry coming from Gaochang Temple to Zhoujiadu, fully loaded with seventy or eighty passengers, approaching the Beifu's side. By this time, the Beifu had already moved away from the wharf and was turning. In the center of the Huangpu River was the Navy's transport ship, the Hua'an. If the Beifu avoided the Hua'an, it would inevitably sink the ferry, and all the passengers would drown. Considering the lesser of two evils, the captain had no choice but to yield to the ferry and collide with the Hua'an transport ship to avoid a major tragedy.</p>
<p>The Hua'an Was Hit. The Beifu crashed violently into the Hua'an's port-side iron plating. The iron plates of the Hua'an transport ship were damaged, a portion dented inward, and a portion broken by the Beifu. The damage was at the waterline, so river water immediately entered the ship. Fortunately, the breach was not large, so it was possible to devise a way to plug the gap and repair it.</p>
<p>Three-Party Joint Inspection. After the incident, the Beifu argued that to preserve the lives of the ferry's passengers, it had to yield, resulting in the collision with the Hua'an. However, the Hua'an was anchored in the river, so the responsibility for the accident rested with the Beifu, which was not in question. As for the damage, after the captain of the Beifu reported to the company, the company, together with the Navy authorities, requested a fair-minded person yesterday to conduct an inspection of the damage to the Hua'an transport ship. The Navy immediately sent the Hua'an to the factory for repairs. The responsible party will pay all repair costs. This matter has already been concluded. The Beifu did not suffer any damage and departed for the Laoyao area of Haizhou yesterday.</p>
<h3>Longshan Shipowner Telegraphs That Japanese Navy Has Understood</h3>
<p>Still Going to Saigon to Load Rice</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Longshan, belonging to the Sanbei Shipping Company, was en route to Saigon to load foreign rice ordered by Chinese merchants when it was struck by a hurricane off Keelung, northern Taiwan, a few days ago. It sent a telegram requesting assistance. After escaping from the hurricane, the shipowner, Leisibei, discovered that seawater had entered the hold, and he anchored there to pump out the water. However, as the location was a Japanese naval port, the stationed Japanese warship summoned the shipowner for questioning. The ship telegraphed Shanghai to report. After the general manager of Sanbei Company, Yu Qiaqing, sent a telegram, he received a telegram from the Longshan shipowner yesterday morning, informing him that they had obtained the understanding of the Japanese warship and would proceed to Saigon to load foreign rice as planned. The water in the ship has been pumped out. After inspection, although it was hit by a hurricane, it fortunately suffered no damage.</p>

<h3>Condolence Telegrams Received by This Newspaper</h3>
<p>To Mr. Shi Yonggeng, care of the Shen Bao Newspaper: It is with great shock that we learned of the tragic death of Shi Gongliang on his way home. The news has caused indescribable sorrow. Alas, the turbulent sea of events, alas, the cruelty of misfortune. How could such a wise man be targeted and attacked? Society is like this, life is like this, there are no tears to cry, no words to mourn. However, our Shi Gong will be admired by all, his great achievements will be a model for generations to come. His coffin will be closed and his life will be assessed, and he will be remembered for a thousand autumns. However, at this time when the country is in difficulty, such a brilliant person has passed away. It is not only that our community has lost a guide, but the country has also lost a pillar. Looking south to Chun Shen (Shanghai), the grief is extreme. I hope that you, sir, will restrain your sorrow and carry on his legacy, to avenge the wrong and complete the unfinished work. If his spirit knows, it will be without regret. Sending condolences from afar, tears and ink mingle together. With this, I respectfully wish you good health. Respectfully, Liu Langping Kofu of the Journalism Department of the Beiping Republic College.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Submits to the Municipal Government for Amendment of the Regulations Restricting Brokerage</h3>
<p>Various Industries Jointly State Their Difficulties</p>
<p>Please Promulgate the Compromise Solution Immediately</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce submitted to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of submitting a request, on the 6th of this month, we received a joint letter from the following trade associations: Fruit and Produce Industry, Seafood and Sundries Industry, Bean and Rice Industry, Coarse Grain and Oilcake Industry, Medicinal Materials Industry, Fresh Pork Industry, Liang Shaojiu Industry, Timber Industry, Charcoal Industry, Green Bamboo Shoots Industry, Salted Fish Industry, Chicken and Duck Industry, Miscellaneous Firewood Industry, Produce Industry, Southern Goods Industry, Cured Meat Industry, Fresh Fish Industry, Northern Goods Industry, etc., stating that since the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau announced the Brokerage Business Regulations on August 30th of this year, all those engaged in brokerage business have been alarmed and distraught. The affiliated associations have repeatedly requested the Chamber to present the case based on reason, industry customs, and the Social Bureau's approval, and to postpone the implementation of the new regulations to ensure that commercial practices and legal principles are considered. The Chamber dispatched Standing Committee Member Jin Runxiang and Committee Member Ma Shaoquan, together with representatives from various industries, including Gu Xinyi, Cai Runshan, Xin Wenyao, Ni Baizhai, Rao Hanzhang, and others, to petition the Municipal Government. Secretary-General Yu personally instructed them to draft a memorandum outlining the difficulties of each industry and submit it to the Government for review and a proper solution to alleviate the merchants' plight. The affiliated associations have separately drafted memorandums and requested the Chamber to forward them to the Municipal Government for review and decision. Nearly a month has passed, and no response has been received from the Municipal Government, leaving the brokers in a state of confusion and uncertainty. It is noted that the business regulations announced by the Finance Bureau this time have changed the usual practice and are based on the seven-point plan for reorganizing brokerage taxes decided by the National Financial Conference issued by the Ministry of Finance. However, Item 3 of the reorganization plan, which restricts brokerage commissions, states that brokerage commissions vary greatly from province to province, ranging from 1% to 5%. Given the current difficulties of agriculture and commerce and the decline in commodity prices, it seems appropriate to impose restrictions, proposing to set a limit of 3%, to be determined by each province and city based on the local trading conditions. The reason for the restriction is nothing more than the inconsistency of the rates charged in various provinces and cities, coupled with the difficulties of agriculture and commerce and the decline in commodity prices. However, the commissions charged by brokers are mostly based on the amount of the transaction. As commodity prices fall, the amount of the transaction also falls, and the commissions charged by brokers also decrease accordingly. It is clear that the difficulties of agriculture and commerce are affected by the decline in commodity prices, not by the amount of the commissions. If the commissions charged by brokers vary greatly from province to province and should be restricted to achieve uniformity, then the trading conditions in each province and city are different, and the rights and obligations of the parties involved in the transactions are also different. The amount of commissions set by each industry is based on the mutual rights and obligations of the parties involved and has been agreed upon by all parties concerned for a long time. Moreover, the economic life of urban areas cannot be compared with the economic life of rural areas. Since the economic conditions of each province and city vary, and the brokerage commissions on which brokers depend for their livelihood are mostly 10% in Shanghai, imposing a uniform restriction would be like cutting off the feet to fit the shoes, putting the brokers in Shanghai to death. However, the last paragraph of the annotation to Item 3, which states that 'commodity prices are falling and restrictions should be imposed, proposing to set a limit of 3%, to be determined by each province and city based on the local trading conditions,' implies that the right to impose restrictions is flexible and can be adjusted freely by each province and city. The Finance Bureau should follow the industry regulations approved by the Social Bureau and separately stipulate the commissions to maintain the industry's inherent customs and secure livelihoods. As for Item 4, the brokerage business tax should be based on the amount of the transaction or the amount of the commission (omitted). If it is collected based on the amount of the transaction, the tax rate should not exceed 3%. If it is based on the amount of the commission, the tax rate should not exceed 20%. In the future, if brokerage businesses are taxed at a rate of 3% based on the amount of the transaction, and brokers comply with Item 3 of the regulations and charge brokerage commissions that are equivalent to the amount of the tax, then the establishment of brokerage businesses would seem to be a tax collection agency, and the brokers themselves would have no means of support. Such a high tax rate and such a restriction on brokerage commissions would surely cause the conference participants to cry out on behalf of the brokers if they carefully reviewed the matter. If it is thought that brokers must be subject to a very heavy business tax, then it would also violate the highest tax rate of the business tax law. However, the Shanghai brokerage business regulations stipulate that the minimum fixed tax cannot be based on the amount of the transaction. Whether or not this fixed rate will be changed in Shanghai should be clearly indicated by the Finance Bureau to reassure the merchants. The affiliated associations have previously stated some of the above points, but there are still some unexpressed concerns. We respectfully submit this joint petition again and request the Chamber to promptly forward it to the Municipal Government to adopt the difficulties raised in the memorandums of the various industries and to quickly issue an improved solution to alleviate the merchants' plight. The Chamber has repeatedly forwarded to your Government the various statements and memorandums submitted by the industries, requesting a compromise solution. Regarding Item 3 of the National Financial Conference's plan for reorganizing brokerage taxes, which states that 'brokerage commissions vary greatly from province to province, ranging from 1% to 5%,' the situation in Shanghai is significantly higher than the so-called 5%. This has been repeatedly stated and need not be repeated. Shanghai is the largest commercial center in the country, and the original plan is so divorced from reality. It is clear that the plan was not based on an actual investigation before the discussion, and it is inappropriate to use it as a standard for restriction. First, the business relationship between merchants is purely a mutual contract between merchants. If it does not harm public order, the state should not interfere excessively. The National Financial Conference's restriction on brokerage commissions is based on the pretext of falling commodity prices. This argument is inappropriate, as detailed in the Chamber's rebuttal. If, as it is said, brokerage commissions are a certain percentage of the price of the goods, then if commodity prices fall, the fixed percentage of the brokerage commission will inevitably fall accordingly. The fall in commodity prices is the cause, and the fall in brokerage commissions is the effect. The state has not restricted commodity prices, which are following the natural trend, but has restricted brokerage commissions alone, which is inappropriate. Moreover, because brokerage commissions are falling due to the fall in commodity prices, merchants are already suffering losses implicitly. If a fixed percentage that does not correspond to the facts is now imposed, wouldn't they be suffering a double loss? Second, based on the above supplementary reasons, we respectfully submit this document again to your Government for review and approval, and we ask that the compromise solution be approved and announced immediately for the convenience of the public."</p>
<h3>Hu Xiyuan Discusses Participating in the Carnival with Domestic Products</h3>
<p>Short Preparation Time, Hoping for Rapid Participation from the Production Sector</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee for Chinese Domestic Products Participating in the Philippine Carnival held its second preparatory committee meeting at 115 Hankou Road yesterday afternoon. According to Mr. Hu Xiyuan, the convener of the committee, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the participation of domestic products in this Philippine Carnival is definitely not the same as domestic product exhibitions in China or foreign expositions that only compete with antiques, carvings, and ivory wares. The Philippines is very close to our country, and our compatriots originally held 80% of the commercial rights, which have now been reduced to 50%. This 30% has been completely seized by the Japanese. If the Chinese do not pay attention to commerce in the Philippines, others will make great progress, while we will lag far behind. The consequences are unimaginable. Mayor Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai is not only concerned about the industry and commerce in the urban area but also pays great attention to foreign trade. Last week, Mayor Wu invited colleagues to lunch at the Municipal Government to discuss this matter. He met with Mayor Shen Honglie of Qingdao and Mayor Yuan Liang of Pingjin in Beijing a few days ago. They expressed that Mayor Wu's initiative to participate in the Philippine Carnival with domestic products was very meaningful and were willing to support the participation. Therefore, it is hoped that all domestic production sectors that produce various daily necessities and domestic products, whether mechanized or native products, that are suitable for sales in the Philippines, will actively and quickly participate for the sake of future overseas trade promotion. Because the preparation time is less than six weeks, it is hoped that all sectors will cooperate to compete for commercial status in the international arena.</p>

It is now learned that the Administration has not completed the preparations for various procedures and will postpone the start date to December 17th, and the daily hours will be changed to 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Coin Exhibition Opens Today</h3>
<p>Displaying More Than 2,700 Kinds of Coins</p>
<p>Exhibition at the New World Hotel for Two Days</p>
<p>Financial figures Wang Shouqian and Ping Yulin, in view of the fact that China has had silver coins for more than 3,000 years, and there are many types of coins in various dynasties, in order to enable the Chinese people to understand the coinage system of various dynasties, have specially decided to publicly exhibit the precious coins purchased and stored with private funds from today to the 9th at Room 324, 3rd Floor, New World Hotel, Nanjing Road, and named it the Rare Chinese Gold, Silver, and Copper Coin Exhibition. According to Mr. Ping Yulin of the Industrial Society, the motive for launching this exhibition is that museums in various countries around the world have coin displays, and many have also collected Chinese coins, spending tens of millions of dollars to enable the public to understand the coinage systems of various countries. However, China has been lacking in this regard for thousands of years, which is regrettable. This time, colleagues have launched an exhibition to display a total of more than 2,700 kinds of coins, all of which are Chinese coins from various dynasties and are rare in society. However, due to the limited capabilities of colleagues, they cannot go to various provinces and cities to hold public exhibitions. They hope that the central authorities will pay close attention to coin displays.</p>

<h3>Liu Kaiqu's Design Is the Best for Sun Yat-sen's Bronze Statue in the Capital</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Municipal Party Department initiated the construction of a magnificent bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen at Xinjiekou in the capital. Since the establishment of the committee responsible for raising funds, it has been several months. Donations from all parties have been very enthusiastic. No less than dozens of designs and drawings for the bronze statue and tower have been sent in, among which the design by Liu Kaiqu, the author of the Anti-Japanese Memorial Tower of the 88th Division in Hangzhou, is the most magnificent. The Municipal Party Department will also ask Liu Kaiqu to make the bronze statue. According to reports, Liu Kaiqu exhibited two large bronze statues and four battle scene reliefs made for the base of the 88th Division's Fallen Soldiers Memorial Tower, which were highly praised by Lu Diping, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Yu Jishi, Director of the Provincial Security Office, and guests from all walks of life. The Beijing Municipal Party Department invited experts to visit the Sun Yat-sen statues and various memorial towers built in various provincial capitals to provide a basis for selecting the artist. According to the expert's report, Liu's sculpture is the most powerful and the most suitable for expressing Sun Yat-sen's great ideas.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Reservations for "Scenic Southeast"</h3>
<p>The book "Scenic Southeast" was compiled for the Southeast Five Provinces Tour. At the beginning of the compilation, the Zhejiang Construction Department invited famous domestic artists to tour a week according to the planned route, and then wrote it into text and attached it with pictures. It took half a year and cost a lot of money. The materials in the book are centered on Zhejiang Province, slightly extending to the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, and Jiangxi bordering Zhejiang. The scenery of Zhejiang Province, such as the peaks of Yandang, the waterfalls of Tiantai, the ancient trees of Tianmu, and the majestic pass of Xianxia, as well as the cliffs of Xuedou Fangyan and the caves of Beishan Shimen, is relatively complete. However, the scenery of the Taihu Lake area in Jiangsu, such as the Zhanggong Shanquan Scenic Cave in Yixing, as well as the glaciers of Jiangxi, the Huangshan Mountains of Anhui, and the Wuyi Mountains of Fujian, which are all places passed through during the tour, are also covered. The entire book is exquisitely printed on copperplate paper, measuring 10.5 inches wide and 14 inches high, and bound into a large volume. With this book, the scenic spots of Southeast China can be seen at a glance. The book is scheduled to be published on January 1, 1935, and reservations have now begun. The price of the book is eight yuan, but reservations only cost four yuan. The reservation locations are the United Advertising Company at 255 Shandong Road, Shanghai, the Sixth Section of the Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government in Hangzhou, the Life Bookstore at 384 Fuzhou Road, Shanghai, and the Shanghai China Travel Service Headquarters and its branches in Nanjing, Hankou, Beiping, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Wuhu. Reservations have been very enthusiastic in recent days.</p>

<h3>Cause of the Shanghai-Taicang Staff's Work Slowdown</h3>
<p>The Reason Is the Retention of Free Travel Passes</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Illegally Arrested a Ticket Inspector</p>
<p>Yesterday (Thursday) at 12:00 noon, when the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus company's fourth bus from Shanghai to Jiading passed through the Dachang station, an inspector in plain clothes boarded the bus and arrived at Liuhang, and carried out an inspection at Liuhang station. At that time, all the passengers on the bus questioned the inspector's right to carry out an inspection in plain clothes and without a badge. Later, the inspector claimed to be a member of the Opium Prohibition Committee and detained one male and one female passenger, taking them to the Liuhang Public Security Substation. They were released immediately after it was found that there were no prohibited items. After arriving at Liuhang, the inspector returned to Baoshan by bus. Station staff Xu Zixiang boarded the bus to check tickets. The inspector presented a free travel pass for the Dachang Public Security Bureau issued by the Shanghai-Taicang Company, but station staff Xu Zixiang, because he was in plain clothes and had no badge, believed that it did not comply with the company's regulations and retained the pass. He then asked the company for instructions. Unexpectedly, the inspector also reported to Zhou Jintang, the director of the Dachang Public Security Bureau, by telephone, and sent five armed police officers, carrying ropes, to rush to Liuhang station, bind Xu, and take him back to Dachang, and then transfer him to Baoshan. It is now known that the company believes that the free travel pass is to provide preferential treatment to maintain local security and charitable and cultural organizations and cannot be considered a due right. When using it, they should abide by the company's regulations. Since the inspector did not use it in accordance with the regulations, he illegally bound the station staff as if arresting bandits. Therefore, the company's staff became dissatisfied and triggered a strike. Yesterday, some of the staff on the Songhu Line declared a work slowdown, believing that unless the perpetrator is punished, it would not be enough to warn others. However, according to news from the Baoshan County Government, Xu Zixiang has been released and ordered to investigate and deal with the matter according to law.</p>
<h3>Port Authority Dredges New Waterway of Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Located near Gaoqiao and Zhanghuabang</p>
<p>Dredged to a width of 300 feet and a length of over 5,000 feet</p>
<p>Two marker ships set up starting yesterday</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Port Authority, starting from the 1st of this month, is re-dredging the new waterway area of the Huangpu River to a width of 300 English feet to facilitate the passage of incoming and outgoing ships. Starting today, two marker ships will be set up there to indicate the depth scale on the Puxi side during low tide. Our Datong News Agency reporter has explored and recorded the details below:</p>
<p>Evolution of the New Waterway: A Datong News Agency reporter inquired with the Customs yesterday morning and learned that this new waterway area is opposite Gaoqiao Sand, near Zhanghuabang. This water area was only newly opened more than ten years ago. Previously, the water flow of the Huangpu River was still on the east side of the new waterway. Later, after the Port Authority's measurements, it was recognized that the old waterway was hindering navigation and water conservancy, so the Dredging Bureau dredged it over a long period. However, now that the number of incoming and outgoing ships is increasing daily, the Port Authority believes it is necessary to continue to widen the new waterway of the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>It was found that Detaille is supervising the dredging to a width of 300 feet and a length of approximately 5,600 feet. The Hailong No. 2 dredger of the Dredging Bureau has started dredging work since the 1st of this month. In recent days, the Chief Engineer of the Dredging Bureau, together with the surveying and dredging personnel, has been supervising the work. The Hailong No. 2 dredger is still new and has a dredging capacity of about 500 to 600 tons per hour. However, when working, due to the need to avoid passing ships, the dredging time is inevitably affected to a considerable extent. Therefore, it is currently impossible to estimate how long it will take to complete the project.</p>
<p>Attention of Ships: During the dredging period, ships passing through this area must slowly sail closer to the Puxi side. If they approach the dredger, they must sound a long signal so that the dredger has sufficient time to loosen its side anchor cables to avoid accidents. As for the relevant signals, all customs' usual berthing signals and lights shall be followed.</p>
<p>Setting up New Markers: The Port Authority Director, Valienne, has issued another notice for setting up marker ships in the area, which roughly states: "Regarding the periodic implementation of dredging the new waterway of the Huangpu River, to designate the boundaries of the navigable waterway starting tomorrow, two marker ships will be set up there starting December 7th of this year. These ships are used to indicate the 18-foot isobath of the Huangpu River on the Puxi side during low tide. One will be berthed downstream of the dredger, approximately 1,500 feet from the ship, and the other will be berthed upstream of the dredger, also 1,500 feet from the ship. Each marker will have the Shanghai Dredging Bureau flag on top of the mast during the day, and two white lights, spaced approximately six feet apart, at night. These lights will be visible at least one mile within the surrounding horizon in clear weather," etc.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Committee Resolves Yesterday to Send Representatives</h3>
<p>To Petition the Fifth Plenary Session</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee held its 32nd executive, design, law, and joint meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Over 20 people attended, including Qiu Liangyu, Qiu Jialiang, Wang Jingdong, Zhou Fuzhang, Zhang Xianfang, Li Ruzhang, Ren Nongxuan, Zhang Yichen, Liu Zhongying, Hu Fengxiang, etc. Zhang Yichen was elected as the chairman and Liang Gengshun as the recorder. After the report, the following cases were discussed: (1) The case of realizing rent reduction to save merchants in distress was resolved: (A) Wang Jingdong and Hu Fengxiang were elected as petition representatives to go to Beijing immediately; (B) A petition will be submitted to the Fifth Plenary Session. (2) The case of the rent for Lao Qichang's Henglong Bingdian was resolved to be handed over to the investigation section for investigation. (3) Wang Xingyi's suggestion to invite comedic masters Liu Chunshan and others to broadcast propaganda for rent reduction was resolved to be notified for publicity separately. (4) The case of how to stop the Nanshi Rent Reduction Special Issue from charging fees with the "subsidy fee" designation was resolved to notify all branch offices to stop it uniformly to maintain the credibility of rent reduction. (5) The case of how to accelerate the rent reduction work was resolved to nominate Zhang Xianfang and Liu Zhongying to prepare a plan for discussion at the next joint meeting. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM. The representatives Hu Fengxiang and Wang Jingdong, who were nominated by the joint meeting to go to Beijing to petition, departed on the Beijing-Shanghai night express train at 11:00 PM last night. The petition is also recorded as follows: The petition is for the reduction of rents, and disputes are increasing daily, resulting in an unstable commercial situation. I implore your esteemed meeting to maintain public sentiment and approve the proposal to implement rent reduction to help merchants in distress. Our association, in response to the requests of the city's citizens and the joint organization of various groups, has been established and has been advocating for nearly a year. Regarding the rent reduction dispute, Shanghai has seen disputes and lawsuits in the courts due to the demand for rent reduction, and households are in dire straits. If this continues, the market will be unstable. The reduction of rents, as in Beijing and Anqing, has precedents. Shanghai, since the serious damage of January 28th, has seen its commercial market decline sharply. It is even more appropriate to implement it in terms of facts and human sentiments. When people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation are unavoidable, the government should have an obligation to maintain them. This is the concern for food, which is why the government flattens the rice price when it rises. Can it be that housing rents are high and not reduced and flattened? This is something the government would not do. Now that your esteemed meeting has opened and the sky is shining again, I implore you to consider the suffering of the people, stand on a fair position, and implement rent reduction resolutely, set up appropriate measures, and order the competent authorities to handle it, so as to maintain people's livelihood and stabilize the area, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<h3>Zhou Xiaoqing and Others Accused After the Closure of Guohua Electric Company</h3>
<p>Purchasing Goods on Credit and Issuing Bad Checks</p>
<p>Zhou and Others Accused of Fraudulently Obtaining Property</p>
<p>Guohua Electric Company was born in response to the popularity of wireless radios. Its shareholders are Zhou Xiaoqing, Chen Zizhen, Zhang Yansheng, Lu Mujun, Zhang Junliang, Yin Guisheng, Gu Ziyan, Xia Jifu, Zhu Zhenlu, Liu Hesheng, and others, totaling ten people. The authorized capital is 32,000 yuan, with each share valued at 10 national currency. A limited liability company was organized, with each shareholder serving as a director or supervisor of the company. Liu Hesheng also served as the manager of the company, overseeing all business operations. The company's address was initially located on Rue du Consulat in the French Concession. Because it was a newly established business, its operations were initially quite prosperous. However, as the number of competitors increased and the price of radios gradually fell, the company began to lose money. By the end of last year, the results of two years of business showed that there was not only no profit, but also a loss of 8,000 gold. After discussions among the shareholders, it was decided to continue operations in the hope of recovering the losses. Unexpectedly, the business in the first quarter of this year was even worse, and the losses were even greater. However, those in charge were still unaware of the situation and instead tried to revitalize the company by claiming to increase capital and expand the scope of business. After spreading rumors that the original address was insufficient, they moved the company to the Xinxin Company on Nanjing Road, the commercial center of the city, on October 1st. Immediately, Chen Zizhen and Liu Hesheng went around purchasing large quantities of goods from Chinese and Western companies specializing in radios and electrical materials on credit. They gave post-dated checks drawn on the Shanghai Bank or Tonghe Bank to pay for the goods. Most of the goods owners were influenced by their earlier rumors and felt that they were extravagant, so they deeply believed in them. However, after the 15th of November, the person in charge of the company suddenly closed the company without waiting for the checks to mature and hired an accountant to announce the liquidation in the newspaper. The goods owners then realized that they had been deceived. As a result, the managers of Philips, Feige, etc., Van Os Wang Jue, Yao Yuyuan, Zhang Zhihua, Zheng Wenyi, Lu Yubin, Yang Xuegeng, Wang Zhentang, Cai Xiangyu, Li Peihang, Chen Shengda, Sun Guangjun, Li Wenxiang, Ge Tai, Xu Qixia, Lin Peiqing, Wang Meiqin, and 26 other households jointly hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court against the company's shareholders and directors Zhou Xiaoqing and others for fraudulently obtaining property. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened the trial. All the plaintiffs unanimously appeared in court and stated that they had been defrauded of goods with bad checks without sufficient funds. They also presented the checks they held as evidence. The amount was approximately 27,000 to 28,000 yuan. Of the ten defendants, only Zhou Xiaoqing, Chen Zizhen, Lu Mujun, Zhang Junliang, Zhu Zhenlu, and Liu Hesheng voted. The accountant hired by the company also appeared in court to report the liquidation process, stating that the company had a total loss of more than 32,000 yuan and that the goods in stock were still worth more than 17,000 gold. Judge Huang then ordered the accountant to investigate and report in detail on two points: how many goods the company had purchased since moving to Nanjing Road and before the liquidation, how much had been sold, and whether there were any funds in the Shanghai Bank for the checks issued to the creditors. The case was then adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Bandit Suppression Army Battalion Commander Flees to Shanghai with Public Funds</h3>
<p>Detained and Transferred to the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Xin Fu, also known as Dehuang, a native of Xinning County, Guangdong, 26 years old, served as the commander of the second transportation battalion in the transportation department of the East Route Headquarters of the Five-Province Bandit Suppression Army in Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Hubei. On October 14th of this year, he was assigned by the commander of the general team, Sun Zhaoren, to take official documents to the military supply department of the Jiangxi Fuzhou Camp to receive 6,900 yuan of public funds to purchase military supplies. After Xin was ordered to Jiangxi, he received the full amount on the 16th of the same month. He did not follow the order to purchase the items but instead secretly fled to Shanghai with the funds, spending the public funds at will. The Beijing Office of the East Route Headquarters of the Five-Province Bandit Suppression Army learned of this and immediately reported it to the Capital Garrison Command and the Police Department for investigation and arrest. It was not until recently that Xin Fu was found to be hiding at No. 44 Garden Lane, Rue Pères, in the French Concession of Shanghai. As a result, the Beijing Office sent adjutant Zhang Naixin and detective Dai Wenshu from the Capital Police Department to Shanghai to report to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and request assistance in the arrest. Wu Tiecheng, who also served as the director of the bureau, ordered the captain of the detective team, Fu Ying, and detectives Wei Feng and Du Jinxiang to go to the French police station with the people who came to report the case on the morning of the previous day and request that police officer Wu Jiahui be dispatched to arrest Xin Fu at No. 44 Garden Lane. Xin happened to be out visiting friends at No. 48 in the same lane, so they immediately rushed over and arrested Xin Fu. They also searched his residence and seized a current account passbook with a balance of 2,000 yuan from the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank's Eight Immortals Bridge branch and two seals, one Xin's personal seal and the other Su Changgan's seal, which is the Shanghai Bank deposit account name. The Su surname seal and clothing baggage check passbook had been withdrawn to five hundred and fifty yuan, and there was still one thousand four hundred and fifty yuan. They were immediately brought into the French police station. According to Xin's confession, after being ordered to Fuzhou, Jiangxi, to receive military funds, he put 4,300 yuan in a leather box and deposited it in his apartment room. He took 2,300 yuan with him to buy things outside. When he returned to his apartment, he found that the leather box containing the funds was missing, and the soldier Zhang Yushan, who was with him, was also missing. This prevented him from returning to cancel the difference. He temporarily stayed in Shanghai. The police chief ordered him to be detained pending referral to the court for review. Yesterday, the police station transferred Xin Fu to the Criminal Division I of the Special District Court, where Judge Cao Junsheng held two hearings. The leader of the detective team of the Public Security Bureau, Wei Feng, submitted an official document requesting the transfer of the lawyer Zhao Chen, who was defending the case, to the police station, stating that the case was based on the report of the Public Security Bureau requesting the Police Department to assist in the arrest of the defendant for embezzling public funds. The Police Department did not object to the Public Security Bureau's request for the transfer to the Police Department. The court was requested to indicate its opinion. Then, an official from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau stated the case, and the court inquired of the defendant Xin Fu, who gave the same confession as he had in the police station. Judge Cao then ruled that the defendant Xin Fu be allowed to be taken away by the official from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to be interrogated.</p>
<h3>Ill-Fated Lovers on a Journey</h3>
<p>Man and Woman Attempt Suicide, Man Dead, Woman Critical</p>
<p>At the Xinmin Hotel in Yingchunfang, Taixin Street, Hubei Road, at about 1:00 AM yesterday morning, a young man in a Western suit and a woman arrived to check in. The man claimed to be Xue Xueliang, 29 years old, from Gansu, a rice merchant, and the woman was Xue Shen, 25 years old. The hotel clerk led them to Room 16 and allowed them to stay. Xue immediately paid the room fee of one yuan and eight cents and instructed the tea boy not to disturb them so that they could sleep peacefully. The tea boy and others did not suspect anything because it was late at night, so they closed the door and left. Unexpectedly, they had not gotten up by about 12:00 PM yesterday. They planned to knock on the door to inquire but suddenly heard a groan coming from the room. Knowing that something was wrong, they quickly tried to open the door and enter, and they saw the man and woman lying horizontally on the bed, both with pale faces. They quickly reported to the police station and had the man and woman taken to the hospital for treatment by car. After examination, it was found that they had both swallowed poison. Two suicide notes were found beside them and taken back to the police station for safekeeping. The man had been poisoned for a long time and could not be saved. He died soon after, and his body was transferred to the coroner's office for autopsy. The woman's life was also hanging by a thread. The reason for the poisoning is unknown.</p>
<h3>Yongfeng Exchange Operates as Usual</h3>
<p>Yongfeng Exchange, located in Fuchengli, Tianjin Road, was established in the 14th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty and has been in business for 47 years, making it the oldest exchange in Shanghai. The original shareholders were Wang Fengnian's ancestor, a Ningbo merchant, Chen Qiushan's successor ancestor, a Shaoxing merchant, and the _ family. Chen recommended his nephew Chen Yizhai as the manager and his fellow villager Tian Qiyuan as the assistant manager. After September 18th and January 28th, Chen wanted to close Yongfeng due to the economic downturn, but Wang did not agree. As a result, at the end of the lunar year, Chen formally withdrew his shares and Wang continued to operate the business solely. However, due to the heavy burden of settling the accounts for the withdrawal of shares, it was impossible to clear them up in a short time. Therefore, the original managers Tian Qiyuan and Li Jisheng stayed at the exchange to settle the accounts, which has been going on for ten months. Wang repeatedly urged Tian and Li, and then formally entrusted an accountant to handle the settlement of accounts. Tian, in his capacity as manager representing Yongfeng, used Wang's three outstanding debts as a way to resist. Wang then filed a lawsuit in court based on Chen's evidence of withdrawing his shares, requesting confirmation that Chen Qiushan had withdrawn his shares and confirmation that the two managers, Tian and Li, had lost their management positions due to Chen's withdrawal of shares. For the sake of protecting his rights, he applied to the court for a preliminary injunction. On the morning of the 3rd of this month, the First Special District Court ruled to grant the preliminary injunction, which stated that before the end of the lawsuit between the two parties confirming the withdrawal of shares and dismissing the managers, the opposing parties could not represent Yongfeng Exchange in any legal act without the consent of the applicant and could not change or move the exchange's property, equipment, documents, account books, inventory, etc. The reason was roughly that in order to maintain the status quo of Yongfeng Exchange and to ensure future compulsory enforcement, it was necessary to prohibit Chen Qiushan and others from engaging in legal acts that were detrimental to the applicant or from changing or moving the exchange's property, equipment, documents, account books, and inventory. After Wang received the ruling, he entrusted a lawyer to send a letter to the opposing lawyer to formulate five articles on the method of preliminary injunction, which were roughly as follows: (1) All records of account books, issuance of notes, receipt and payment of cash, preparation of letters, and stamping of receipts and receiving letters should still be handled by the original management personnel and must be approved by Fengnian, and Fengnian or an accountant or clerk entrusted by Fengnian should add a private seal on it for certification. (2) Major matters such as the recovery of loans, the signing of contracts, the increase in outstanding overdrafts, and the establishment of new pledges and new loans must be requested Fengnian's consent in advance, and Fengnian must affix his private seal to indicate approval. (3) Deeds, bonds, stocks, and all vouchers and documents should be stored in a library. The opposing party should list two copies of the list, which should be verified by Fengnian, and both parties should affix their seals. One copy should be stored in the library, and one copy should be handed over to Fengnian. The keys should be held by each party, and both parties should seal them to prevent changes or movements. (4) At the end of each day, the silver ocean should be checked against the inventory book, and the vault keys should be held by each party. The vault should be opened jointly the next day to prevent changes or movements. (5) All seals, account books, and all documents must be jointly kept by both parties to prevent changes or movements. The intention was to make all future actions of Yongfeng Exchange open to the public so that they could be supervised to avoid unexpected infringements. After the letter was sent, Chen and Tian did not reply and filed an appeal against the preliminary injunction. On the 6th of this month, the original court ruled to change the original ruling and rejected the application for a preliminary injunction. Wang obtained the ruling on the preliminary injunction for only three days before the original ruling was changed, so he was deeply shocked. He plans to file an appeal immediately to seek relief. At the same time, Yu Qiaqing and Qin Runqing believe that the situation is escalating, which is not a blessing for both parties, and plan to find a way to mediate.</p>
<h3>One Yuan Notes of the Bank of China Changed from Beijing to Shanghai Use</h3>
<p>The words "Beijing" are crossed out and the words "Shanghai" are printed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association received a sample of one yuan notes sent by the Shanghai Bank of China and recorded its original letter, which stated, "To whom it may concern, the Shanghai denomination one-yuan notes of our bank are in increasingly high demand in the mainland. The printed notes have all been used up. The ordered notes have not yet arrived in Shanghai. In order to meet the urgent needs of society, we have changed the Beijing denomination one-yuan notes that our bank has printed and is awaiting release to Shanghai denomination, added the Shanghai note signature, and issued them immediately in order to speed up the process. The style is the same as the Shanghai one-yuan notes, but the color is slightly different. All Chinese and Western Beijing denominations on the front and back have been crossed out with several black lines and changed to print the words 'Shanghai'. They are used in the same way as the Shanghai denomination notes. We have sent a sample of the front and back on one piece of paper each. Please check and keep it. When the notes are on the counter, please use them in the same way as the original Shanghai one-yuan notes. We are very grateful for your public relations." The association has approved this and has pasted the sample in the market to facilitate the identification and use of members.</p>

Sixteen schools have been exhibited, and all have achieved excellent results. Recently, the association, in view of the approaching end of the year, in order to continue to work hard to arouse the public's use of national products, has specifically designated the Shanghai Public Education Center on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi to hold a national products trademark sample exhibition for three days starting on the 14th of this month.

(3) The aforementioned trademark exhibition will display objects divided into six types: patterns, sample photos, certificates, physical styles, and event life (each factory must have at least two types of patterns and physical styles when participating). All of these will be prepared by the manufacturers themselves.

<h3>French Concession Board of Directors Increases Wine Tax</h3>
<p>Increases from One Liang to Five Liang Per Month</p>
<p>Wine Stores Ask for Assistance from the Citizens' Association</p>
<p>Xin Xin She says, Wan Shun Xin Store, No. 475 Rue Albert, French Concession, has recently been subjected to a sudden increase in wine tax by the French Concession Board of Directors. Starting from November, the tax has increased from one liang to five liang per month. The store owner, Chen Yunzhang, believes that the increase in wine tax is unreasonable and cannot afford it. He took a letter to the Eighth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens' Association to request assistance. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Dear committee members, please note that the wine tax on our small store has been increased out of the blue. The usual wine tax is one liang of silver per month, which is equivalent to 1.4 yuan in silver. Now, in November, it has suddenly increased by four liang of silver, making a total of five liang, which is equivalent to seven yuan in silver. However, our small store is very small, with only one shopfront, located at No. 475 Rue Albert in the French Concession. But this place is extremely deserted, and business is very small. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain even without an increase in wine tax, and it is even more difficult with an increase. The wine tax is suddenly increased, and the monthly earnings are not enough to pay the tax, which is less than seven yuan. In addition, we requested the members of the Eighth District Branch to go to the General Office of the Municipal Council the other day to request an exemption from the increase, but the General Office replied that they would send someone to investigate and then talk about it. Today, December 5th, the Municipal Council sent a letter stating that if the increased amount is not paid within five or six days, they will send someone to cut off the electricity wires at our small store. However, our small store has never owed any electricity fees to the electricity company. The Municipal Council is completely using coercive measures to deal with merchants. We are writing to request your association to uphold justice, negotiate on the basis of reason, and exempt us from the increased wine tax and unreasonable cutting off of electricity wires in order to maintain the difficult business."</p>

<h3>Investigation Confirms Five Robberies by Bandits</h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled After Interrogation</p>
<p>Huang Fugen, a Chinese detective from the Huishan Patrol Room, along with Detective Sun Aizhong and Chief Detective Mao Yiwen, previously apprehended three bandits – Yu Baolin from Ningbo, Chen Tanfu (also known as Mi Zhangsheng), and Huang Yinpu – in the jurisdictions of East Huade Road, Xinji Bang Road, and Pudong. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan of the Criminal Division Three conducted a trial. Lawyer Li Zhishan from the Public Works Department stated that investigations revealed that Yu and Chen, the two defendants, had, between January 18th and November 26th, held weapons and conspired to rob: Lu Lierong at No. 25 Changkang Lane, Zhoujiazhui Road; Shi Shanbao at No. 366 Tangshan Road; Qian Xiuyun, Wu Buzhou, and Zhang Chaodong at No. 14 Fengsheng Lane, Mao Hai Road; Wu Zhangshi at No. 58 East Huade Road; and a certain surname at No.  Hua Ji Road, Sanguantang, stealing clothing and silver worth over 800 yuan, totaling five cases. He requested severe punishment. However, Huang Yinpu was found to be unrelated to the cases, and the Patrol Room withdrew his detention, releasing him first. The court approved this. According to the victims who successively arrived in court, they testified about the robbery situation at the time. Judge Wu interrogated the defendants clearly and ordered them to be returned to custody, scheduling a sentencing date.</p>
<h3>Adopted Son of Deceased Gu Jisheng Files Appeal</h3>
<p>Sentencing on the 14th</p>
<p>The late Gu Jisheng, a local detective of the French Concession Patrol Room, in addition to serving as a public servant, also managed real estate, accumulating assets of hundreds of thousands of taels of gold. He owned a residence at No. 14 Pingji Road. Because he had no children, he adopted a son named Wei Yi, also known as Longgen, who is now married with children. Wei Yi was addicted to opium, did not work, and was extravagant. Gu was worried and adopted a 14-year-old son from Suzhou, Chen Xushi's son named Zhongxun (now 17 years old), as a second adopted son. After entering the family, he quarreled with Wei Yi daily due to Wei Yi's opposition. Gu was also old, weak, and bedridden year-round. For the sake of family peace, he temporarily sent Zhongxun to a friend surnamed Kong and enrolled him in the nearby Tonghui School, with all expenses paid by Gu. Unexpectedly, recently, Gu abandoned Zhongxun. Therefore, Zhongxun's mother, Chen Xushi, as the legal guardian, and her son hired a lawyer and filed a suit in the Criminal Division of the Special Court, accusing Gu Jisheng and Gu Wei Yi of abandonment. After the trial, the plaintiff lost the case. Gu Jisheng also passed away after the verdict. However, Gu Zhongxun and his mother were determined not to accept the original verdict and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, stating their reasons. After the High Court opened an investigative court, summoned witnesses, and concluded the interrogation, yesterday, Presiding Judge Guo Dezhang, along with Judges Zhang and Sun, and the Prosecutor of the court, formed a collegial panel and summoned both parties and a German individual for interrogation. After arguments by both lawyers, the court declared the debate closed and scheduled sentencing for the 14th.</p>
<h3>Fire in Sanpailou, Within the City</h3>
<p>At the home of Wang Futian, No. 48 Beidang Lane, Sanpailou, Shanghai City, yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, his wife, Wang, inadvertently left firewood unattended while preparing breakfast. Immediately, thick smoke filled the air, and the fire raged uncontrollably. The patrol police, upon seeing it, immediately telegraphed various fire brigades, which rushed fire trucks to the scene and tried to put out the fire. Fortunately, it was daytime, and the fire was extinguished after a while. Only the kitchen and two rooms were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Fire on Pushan Road, Zhabei</h3>
<p>At 12:20 PM yesterday, a fire broke out at the home of Wang Shi, an elderly Shaoxing woman, at No. 1 Dehe Lane, Pushan Road, Zhabei, because she left the fire unattended outside the stove while cooking. In an instant, thick smoke billowed out, and flames soared, completely destroying the bungalow she lived in and spreading to the adjacent houses at No. 3 and No. 5. The fire brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire at 1:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Pharmacy Owner Acquitted in Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Legally Responsible Person to Bear Criminal Responsibility</p>
<p>Shao Sunshi, wife of Shao Zhiying, a local resident of No. 283 Zhiren Lane, Kaizi'er Road, French Concession, suffered postpartum blood collapse in September of this year. Shao engaged traditional Chinese medicine doctor Zhou Weiqing for treatment. After examination, Dr. Zhou prescribed a blood-tonifying formula, instructing her to take one dose first and then return for a revised prescription. Shao took the prescription to Wang Tianfu Tang Chinese medicine store at the intersection of Xixinqiao Street, Fama Road, French Concession (the store had been open for decades and recently moved to Lucha Garden Road, Jiumu, after the lease expired; it had not been open for long). She bought two doses of medicine and took them home. After taking one dose, her condition not only did not improve but worsened. Shao urgently called Dr. Zhou again for examination and also examined the dregs. He discovered that the Puhuang carbon and Chen'ai carbon were not properly roasted or dried. Because raw ingredients cannot tonify blood but can stop blood, Shao immediately asked the doctor to prescribe another formula to remedy her condition. Meanwhile, she engaged lawyer Peng Qixiu to file a suit in the Special Court against Wang Futang, the owner of Wang Tianfu Tang pharmacy, for negligent business practices causing injury, based on Article 301 of the Criminal Law, requesting legal investigation and also filing a civil suit to recover losses. The court, after receiving the suit, ordered Judge Sun Peng to open a court session to summon and interrogate witnesses and verify the case. Yesterday morning, a continued trial was held, still presided over by Judge Sun in the criminal court. The defendant arrived with his defense lawyer, Zhu Taiqing. According to Wang's statement, "I do not manage the counter dispensing of medicine, and I was also unaware that the plaintiff came to collect the medicine. Therefore, I cannot be responsible for what the plaintiff accused." Then, witness Luo Jizhang, an apprentice, testified, "I do not manage the packaging of medicine; I only manage roasting the medicine." Witness Cao Yi also testified, "I work as a clerk at Wang Tianfu Tang. On September 19th, someone came to get two doses of medicine. I dispensed it, roasting both the Puhuang and Chen'ai thoroughly and putting them in. The boss does not manage packaging the medicine on the counter." The defendant, Wang Futang, also stated, "The plaintiff and I do not know each other, and the plaintiff is also from a pharmacy background and is now unemployed. Her purpose in suing me is to extort money." Upon hearing this, the plaintiff requested the court clerk to record Wang's statement clearly. The court then immediately began the debate and declared it closed, immediately acquitting the defendant and transferring the attached civil lawsuit to the civil court for trial. The judge also explained the meaning of the verdict to both parties, saying that the person packaging the medicine was not the defendant in this case and that the subject of the lawsuit was wrong. The legally responsible person must bear criminal responsibility. The plaintiff did not sue the defendant's employee before the debate concluded, so the defendant was acquitted.</p>
<h3>Impersonating a Court Investigator to Extort Money</h3>
<p>Huang Wanfang, who runs a clothing store on Daji Road outside the West Gate, has recently been involved in a lawsuit with others in the District Court that has not yet concluded. Yesterday afternoon, Lou Caihua, a Shaoxing native, suddenly arrived at the store, claiming to be an investigator from the District Court and demanding an investigation fee of several yuan. Huang Wanfang, knowing that the court does not charge such fees, clearly suspected impersonation and fraud. He pretended to comply and offered him cigarettes. Lou, seeing Huang's accommodating attitude, became complacent and began to brag. Unexpectedly, Huang ordered his apprentice to sound the alarm, and Lou was arrested and taken to the Ximen Branch Bureau. During interrogation, he confessed to selling old books. Today, he visited a friend in the area and used deceitful words to defend himself. Because the suspect dared to impersonate a public official and extort money, which is extremely illegal, it was immediately ordered that the suspect Lou Caihua be escorted to the District Court with documentation, requesting punishment according to the law to serve as a warning to others.</p>

<h3>Tang Hanwen Declared Not Guilty Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lawyer Yu Xiangqin Vigorously Defends</p>
<p>Xinmin News reports that Tang Hanwen and Shen Shizhong, who were wrongly convicted and sentenced to one year and nine months in prison in the Clark Road Jingxin Printing Press robbery case in May of this year, were defended by their lawyer Yu Xiangqin, who presented the points of false accusation in detail and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. After three investigation court sessions, the truth of the case was revealed. November 30th was the date of the appeal court hearing. Presiding Judge Guo Dezhang presided over the court and inquired in detail. The lawyer Yu presented the reasons for the appeal and the points of false accusation in detail, stating roughly that the appellant makes a living as a butcher, with monthly income ranging from one hundred and several tens of yuan to seven hundred yuan. Therefore, it is difficult to believe that he would give up his good business and covet a mere five yuan to commit robbery. If it is said to be the money from sharing the spoils, then why did Wang Meisheng and Chen Zhikang each get sixteen yuan, while the appellant only got five yuan? It can be seen that although the patrol room used torture to extract a confession and fabricate a crime, there were still loopholes to be found. Upon inspecting the Jingxin Printing Press, no one was seen holding a handgun at the time of the incident. The patrol room did not find a handgun at the appellant's place or at the Lu's place. Both parties in the confession also said that they did not carry a handgun. Therefore, there was no murder weapon in this case, and the so-called aiding and abetting robbery with a weapon is completely unfounded. Upon inspecting the defendants related to this case, they all stated that they had "never seen each other and did not know each other," which further proves that the appellant was not involved in this case, etc. At this point, the debate concluded. Yesterday was the date of the sentencing. Presiding Judge Guo Dezhang still presided over the court, inquired briefly, and then acquitted Tang Hanwen and Shen Shizhong in court. After the verdict was announced, the court adjourned.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I recently read in today's news column that a fire broke out at Wanxing Tobacco and Wine Store, No. 36 Hengtong Road. The cause of the fire was that the firewood store at No. 38 was careless in the front building, causing the fire to spread. The entire upstairs of our store was burned down. Fortunately, the interior of the store was not affected. Now, the Xinzha Public Security Bureau has arrested the Xu surname, the fire starter at No. 38. The truth will not be difficult to find. I am afraid that outsiders do not understand the truth, so I am writing to request your newspaper to make a correction. Sincerely, Wanxing Jiao Ji Book, December 7th,</p>

<h3>The Crisis of China and the World (4)</h3>
<p>Lecture by Dr. Eddy, recorded by Bingxun Quick Recording Society, Shen Wan Quick Recording</p>
<p>In Beiping, I met Dr. Hu Shi, who said that China needs social reform. He also said, "Some places in China still have the bad habits of foot-binding." The way they walk is awkward and delicate. This bad habit not only restricts their bodies but also their minds. Japanese women walk freely, and women all over the world walk freely. Why are Chinese women so restricted in their walking? From a political, intellectual, moral, economic, and social point of view, China urgently needs new people and new methods to lead the people. Now, I have a question to ask: are we new leaders? Are we sound? Can we save China? If not, what is the reason? Let me give you a few examples. When I arrived in Tianjin, I saw that the shops in the Japanese concessions were selling heroin, morphine, and other drugs to numb the people of North China. And when I went to ____, I saw that people were addicted to opium. The smoky, hazy scene blurred the entire North China. Here is a photo of an eleven-year-old, who also died from taking Japanese drugs. Here is also a photo of five hundred opium addicts, also poisoned by the Japanese. But even more terrible than this poison is that the Chinese themselves grow opium. In Sichuan, I could buy opium anytime, anywhere, like buying bread, selling it package by package. Anyone could buy it, even children. How can we save China like this? There is also something ten times more detestable than the Japanese poisoning North China, and that is corruption. Corruption can destroy the army, corrupt the government, and lead to the failure of businesses. I once saw in Henan a coal-producing area with very rich annual output. Initially, the mine was run by foreigners, with only a few dozen people in charge, and they made a lot of money. Later, the Chinese took it back and operated it, employing six hundred people to manage it. These six hundred people were all their relatives and friends, all embracing the principle of corruption. Originally, they could earn 130,000 yuan each year, but at the end of the year, the accounts showed a loss of 2 million yuan. Soon, it was about to go bankrupt. Later, when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek found out, he sent people to reorganize it and dismissed the six hundred administrative personnel, reorganizing it. By the end of the second year, they had earned back 1.3 million yuan. China has always had silk, tea, and ____ as major export items. Where are China's exported silk and tea now? China has always exported tea, but now its markets have been seized by India, Japan, and Ceylon. There was a province where the government allocated 200,000 to 250,000 yuan to help the rural areas. This amount was spent in five parts, but four-fifths of the money was used for the people, and the remaining one-fifth went into their own pockets. The agricultural tools purchased were not good, and the farmers did not get any benefit. Is this still considered helping the rural areas? This kind of corrupt behavior is plundering the lifeblood of the country. There was a ____ in Rehe, governed by a very fat general. He had many motorcades and many concubines, but one hundred and forty-eight Japanese soldiers drove him away. If this corrupt system is not changed, China will never have hope. Thirty years ago, when I lectured in the north, many students listened to my lectures. When they heard about the revolution, everyone applauded greatly. However, because they were dishonest, they became officials themselves and were even more corrupt than the officials of the Qing Dynasty. Now, I ask you, are you honest? Are you clean? I will give two examples, one of honesty and one of dishonesty. The honest person is George Washington, who did many great things in American history. And a dishonest person is ____. Previously, there was a very smart student in Peiping who thought he could save China. He could give speeches and often used the Three Principles of the People as his slogan. Later, he became an official and earned 500 yuan a month. After that, the government sent him abroad. He stayed in very aristocratic hotels and told many lies. Later, the government found out and dismissed him from his post. As a result, he became unemployed and ended up in Shanghai as a ____ bandit. This is the result of dishonesty. Ladies and gentlemen, the Chinese are a pile of loose sand, only knowing selfishness and self-interest, only knowing corruption. Can this kind of dishonesty save China? Can the country be saved if they are always drunk and dreaming? Are you honest? Is your mind pure? Can you save the country? We all know that loose sand cannot be combined. We need to use cement to solidify it. Can it be that we rational human beings cannot unite? We must be as hard as stone, using inner and outer efforts to save China, to cope with the major crisis facing China and the world today. (The End)</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Vocational Education Report</h3>
<p>The general situation report on vocational education of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education is as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangsu's handling of vocational education did not start today, roughly speaking, it has a history of twenty years. At its peak, there were more than two hundred and seventy A and B types of industrial schools in the province, and the vocational education attached to them is not included. As for the promotion and research of vocational education, considerable efforts have also been made, such as setting up vocational education instructors, holding meetings of principals of B-type industrial schools, and organizing the Provincial Vocational School Federation, all of which are manifestations of their efforts. Weighing the situation and measuring the reasons, the future of vocational education in Jiangsu should be very optimistic. However, until the reorganization of schools in 1927, elementary schools were uniformly changed to ordinary elementary schools, and B-type industrial schools ceased to exist due to this. The merger of secondary schools and normal schools affected A-type industrial schools. Only the four schools of Su Nong, Huai Nong, ____ Can, and Aquatic Products, as well as the two vocational departments of secondary schools, can survive independently. Considering the results, the reason why this happened is that the poor management of vocational education in the past really led to it. Analytically speaking, there are four points: (1) Due to the courses being too generalized, the courses of past vocational schools often leaned towards general subjects, and did not focus on skills training, resulting in their graduates not being as good as ordinary secondary school students in terms of scientific theory, and not as practical as farmers and workers in terms of vocational skills. They were often famous but not real; (2) Due to the lack of appropriate factory and farm equipment, past agricultural and industrial vocational schools also had attached farms and factories, but either the sites were too small or the equipment was incomplete, and they were only used for students' experiments. In fact, the results of the experimental work, even the best ones, were only like the science experiment rooms of ordinary secondary schools, which could be used for teachers' explanations; (3) Due to the lack of importance attached to the operation of agricultural and industrial farms, the lack of equipment in agricultural and industrial farms was as described above, and vocational school teachers were also mostly confined to old habits, able to speak but unable to do, and the basic practical work of agricultural and industrial farms was mostly done by agricultural workers hired by the school. Students only learned from the examples of farmers and workers in agricultural and industrial farms, and teachers mostly stood by and supervised. Teachers and students lacked basic production skill training in agricultural and industrial farms; (4) Due to the lack of close contact between schools and the vocational industry, past vocational schools specialized in teaching and rarely had close contact with enterprises of the same nature, so the skills trained by schools were not linked to the actual needs of the vocational industry, resulting in extreme difficulties in the employment prospects of graduates. For these reasons, although vocational education in Jiangsu once started for a while, it ultimately failed to achieve significant results, and the credibility of the society was not established. ____ As the days went by, it became even more alienated, and it fell to an all-time low, which is also a matter of course.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1931, the Ministry of Education, in view of the abnormal expansion of ordinary secondary schools in recent years, the number of secondary school graduates has increased sharply, but only a few of them can go on to higher education. Those who cannot go on to higher education also lack the training in appropriate production skills and cannot engage in appropriate occupations to earn an independent living. If we do not seek relief urgently, it will be a hidden danger for the society and the country. Therefore, the Ministry issued Instruction No. 536, restricting the establishment of ordinary secondary schools, increasing vocational schools, adding vocational departments or vocational subjects in ordinary secondary schools, and county-run ____ secondary schools should be attached to or converted into rural normal schools and vocational departments, and Instruction No. 1436, issuing the implementation plan for the establishment of secondary agricultural and industrial schools in various provinces and cities. After receiving the order, the Department of Education immediately examined the actual situation of secondary education in Jiangsu Province and actively followed the instructions. Later, in September 1931, Instruction No. 19736 was received, issuing the standards and methods for the establishment and funding allocation of secondary schools in various provinces and cities. It was found that the number of vocational schools in Jiangsu Province had sharply decreased since the reorganization of schools in 1927, and has gradually increased again in recent years, aiming to reach the standards stipulated by the Ministry by 1937. However, it is still uncertain whether it can be fully realized according to the planned plan. The progress of provincial vocational schools in recent years is reported in numbers as follows: In 1930, there were four vocational schools and two vocational departments in secondary schools, which was the same as in 1927, with a total of nine departments and thirty-seven classes, and a recurrent expenditure of 238,802 yuan, accounting for 13.61% of the total recurrent expenditure of secondary education. By 1931, there were five vocational schools and four vocational departments in secondary schools, with a total of eleven departments and forty-two classes, and a recurrent expenditure of 19.79 yuan, accounting for 15.65% of the total, an increase of 2.05% compared to 1930, totaling 51,990 yuan. By 1932, there were six vocational schools and four vocational departments in secondary schools, with a total of three departments and forty classes, and a recurrent expenditure of 332,435 yuan, accounting for 17.21% of the total, an increase of 1.56% compared to five years, totaling 41,643 yuan. By 1933, there were six vocational schools, plus one public school, and four vocational departments in secondary schools, with a total of fourteen departments and fifty-one schools, and a recurrent expenditure of 411,841 yuan, accounting for 19.23% of the total, an increase of 1.01% compared to 1932, totaling 75,406 yuan. By 1934, there were nine vocational schools and three vocational departments in secondary schools, with a total of seventeen departments and fifty-four classes, and a recurrent expenditure of 551,624 yuan, accounting for 25.31% of the total, an increase of 6.08% compared to 1933, totaling 139,783 yuan. The number of temporary expenses allocated over the years is not included. This is only for the progress of provincial vocational schools in recent years. Furthermore, in terms of the situation of county and private vocational schools, the financial situation of county secondary schools in Jiangsu Province is more complicated, and each county has more ____ special histories. If it must be handled in accordance with the financial distribution standards for secondary schools promulgated by the Ministry, there will inevitably be many difficulties. Because the education budget of each county in Jiangsu Province has always been divided into administrative expenses, general education expenses, compulsory education expenses, and social education expenses, the expenses of senior elementary schools, ordinary secondary schools, and vocational schools belong to general education expenses, and the expenses of primary elementary schools and normal education belong to compulsory education expenses. In order to prevent encroachment, the funds of each item must not be misappropriated arbitrarily. If we want to overturn the established practice and redistribute it, difficulties will inevitably arise. In addition, the secondary education funds of each county are limited. Within a county, it is rare to run secondary schools, normal schools, and vocational schools at the same time. Therefore, in terms of funding allocation, it is difficult to meet the standards promulgated by the Ministry anyway. Due to the lack of ____ methods, we came up with a remedy, which is to restrict the expansion of county and private secondary schools arbitrarily, promote vocational schools at all levels, and actively promote them. We have formulated specific measures and notified various counties: (1) County-run secondary schools that originally ran on a single-track system must not expand classes under the pretext of a large number of students going on to higher education. Those that originally ran on a single-track system will gradually reduce enrollment from 1934 and be converted into a single-track system by 1937; (2) Counties that already run vocational schools should find ways to expand them, and those that have not yet run them should prepare to establish them immediately. The funds should be offset by the reduced secondary schools or newly added funds. In case the funds are limited, vocational supplementary schools should also be set up to train production skills for students who cannot go on to higher education; (3) Private secondary schools that have been established and are located in areas with a large number of ordinary secondary schools should be urged and persuaded to reduce ordinary classes and gradually convert to vocational schools or vocational supplementary schools; (4) Since ____, individuals who are preparing to establish secondary schools should be urged and persuaded to convert to vocational schools or vocational supplementary schools. If the funds are not very abundant, they should be directly persuaded to convert to elementary schools to show restrictions. Since the order was issued, it has been quite effective. It is estimated that in 1930, there were only three county-run vocational schools and four private vocational schools. By 1934, the number of county-run vocational schools had increased to eleven and the number of private vocational schools had increased to fourteen. This is the general situation of the promotion of vocational education in various counties by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education in recent years in accordance with the Ministry's instructions.</p>
<p>The above is in terms of the increase in the number of vocational schools. In terms of the qualitative improvement, we have already seen the reasons for the failure of vocational education in the past. This time, we are not ____ a second experiment. From a negative point of view, how should we try to avoid all the past misfortunes so that they do not reappear? From a positive point of view, how should we plan to be perfect and open up new paths to obtain better results? Our responsibilities lie in this, and we must always keep this in mind. The main points of the improvement plan implemented in the past three years are described below to see the general class of attention to improvement at ordinary times. According to this plan, there are still those who continue to promote it.</p>
<p>A. Regarding agricultural schools: (1) Pay attention to vocational goals, revise curriculum standards, so that the focus of the curriculum is on vocational training, not on cultivating higher education. In order to achieve this goal, take centralized basic training, add knowledge of specialized studies as needed, and increase the amount of practical skill training to arouse students' interest in farming; (2) Focus on agricultural product manufacturing and gradually enrich agricultural product processing equipment; (3) Pay attention to promoting cooperative business, in order to ____ make schools and rural life a whole.</p>
<p>B. Regarding sericulture schools: (1) Improve seed production and silk reeling, proceed simultaneously, and at the same time promote the results obtained in their ____ experimental institute in the sericulture industry, so that schools and the sericulture industry become a whole; (2) Pay off all the old loans of the old factory owners of the school in one lump sum, in order to increase the credibility of the school and the factory owners.</p>
<p>C. Regarding agricultural and sericultural research and experimental institutions, it is planned to unite the agricultural colleges of various famous universities in the capital and this province, guiding institutes, experimental farms, and ____ affiliated agricultural and sericultural schools to organize agricultural and sericultural research institutions, classify them by category, and engage in research, experiments, and guidance on various improvement matters in agricultural farms.</p>
<p>D. Regarding aquatic product schools: (1) Add all application instruments to enhance the effectiveness of education; (2) Set up ways to ____ set up trawls within possible scope, so that students can get full benefits from fishery practice; (3) ____ Order the school to make full use of the school's canning and ____ factory equipment, and strive to increase the efficiency and income of the internship every day; (4) Encourage the school to continue to work hard and maintain close contact with the fishing industry.</p>
<p>E. Regarding industrial schools (1) Continue to complete the equipment of the workshops of various industrial schools to increase the teaching and internship efficiency of each school, and actively find ways to focus on the production of school workshops, so that the manufacturing cost is reduced and the shipping standards are increased. ____ The workshop's own business has therefore developed day by day. In terms of employees, there are also profit-sharing incentive methods to meet the principles of business economics; (3) Students in the factory practice are completely the same as ordinary workers. Unless they absolutely obey the orders of the technicians, they are not allowed to enter the factory to work.</p>
<p>F. Regarding commercial schools, we adopt a centralized enrichment method. The provincial school's senior high school commercial department is responsible for the provincial Shanghai High School to handle, and actively enrich the equipment, such as the storage of internship bank funds, the actual operation of small-scale asset consumption cooperation, and the equipment of the commodity display room are all organized according to actual needs, distinguishing between urgency and priority.</p>
<p>Most recently, in November, a conference of principals of provincial vocational schools in the province was convened. Issues such as the employment prospects of graduates, subject teaching materials, the amount of internship, and the contact between the ____ department and enterprises of the same department were all discussed in detail and plans were formulated for adoption. These are all related to the qualitative improvement of vocational education.</p>
<p>Education is the whole problem of the country, and vocational education is no exception. Moreover, in terms of the essence of vocational education, the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce is the foundation. In terms of a province, it is not possible to achieve perfection unless the four industries of ____ people, finance, education, and construction are truly integrated and jointly planned. At present, although Jiangsu Province has not yet promulgated regulations on the joint handling of vocational education by other departments and the Department of Education, in fact, it already has the trend of an invisible alliance between the four industries of people, finance, education, and construction. There are many examples, such as the former Industry Department allocating textile finishing machinery to the dyeing and weaving factory of Suzhou Industrial School. Some of the Construction Department has also designated several farms, and the Department of Education has ordered the county education bureaus where they are located to formulate a reorganization plan to be responsible for the handling. The Land Bureau is carrying out the land survey and measurement business, and Suzhou Industrial School is training talents for it and borrowing instruments. The relationship between each other is getting deeper and deeper. The Finance and Construction Departments recently consulted with the Department of Education on the establishment of a training farm for agricultural cooperation talents. ____ Suzhou and Huaiyin schools were ordered to select ____ agricultural students. These are all obvious ____ in people's ears and days. This spirit of union is progressing day by day, and it is the dawn of the future of vocational education in Jiangsu. What we can be gratified about is that ____ those who run vocational education in Jiangsu Province are unusually cautious in the past, and all promotion plans in recent years, or because of following the previous orders, or due to the special situation of the local area, may still be ____ compliant with the recent ministerial order urging various provinces and cities to promote vocational education methods, and we still ask ____ to give a preliminary review and remove ____ opinions. In addition to submitting another proposal, we will also report the facts truthfully. ____ Is there any need for review? The person in charge of vocational education at the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, Xiang Shaoxuan.</p>
<h3>National Labor Exhibition, Day 7</h3>
<p>Sixty-Three Groups Visited Yesterday</p>
<p>The Number of People Reached More Than Three Thousand One Hundred</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 7th Dispatch) A total of sixty-three schools and groups, with three thousand one hundred and seventy-eight people, visited the National Vocational Education and Labor Exhibition on the 7th.</p>
<h3>Labor Exhibition Investigation Record</h3>
<p>The National Vocational School and Primary and Secondary School Labor Course Achievement Exhibition, organized by the Ministry of Education in its 23rd year, opened on the 1st of this month. The preparations and the visits from various sectors in recent days have been reported in various newspapers. This reporter has conducted a detailed investigation and contacted the relevant staff, obtaining materials that can be used as a systematic record. Therefore, I am writing this report to share with fellow journalists, hoping to be the first to present it.</p>
<h3>(1) Preparation Situation</h3>
<p>The exhibition was originally scheduled to be held on October 10th. In mid-July, five preparatory committee members, Tang Xifen, Gu Zhaolin, Zhou Bangdao, Dai Yingqin, and Zhong Daozan, were appointed to take charge. However, borrowing venues such as the Lishi Society, YMCA, Zhongren Sports Field, and Overseas Chinese Reception Center was unsuccessful, and the Chaoda Palace was in a dilapidated state, impossible to repair. It was difficult to find a suitable venue, and the preparations almost came to a halt. Finally, it was discovered that the Examination Yuan examination hall would be available in mid-November, and the new building of the Ministry of Transportation was completed and could be used as the exhibition venue. The preparatory committee members then negotiated separately. Eventually, with the special approval of President Dai Jitao, it was decided to use the Examination Yuan examination hall. The examination hall was magnificent and meticulously built, and measures had to be taken to protect the windows and floors from damage. At this time, the number of preparatory committee members had been increased to sixteen, and five standing committee members were appointed to oversee the overall situation. After multiple discussions, it was generally agreed that carpets had to be laid and displays arranged along the interior and exterior edges to prevent damage to the floors, doors, and windows. Otherwise, with tens of thousands of visitors walking and crowding inside every day, it would be difficult to guarantee that there would be no damage. The standing committee members of the association put a lot of effort into protecting the examination hall. As a result, the expenditure on protecting the building reached as much as two thousand yuan, showing the importance attached to public property.</p>
<p>The most difficult problem for the association, besides the venue address, was the display cabinets for the exhibits. Custom-made cabinets would not only have uncertain costs but also be limited by time. Simple cabinets would not be aesthetically pleasing, while elaborate ones would be too expensive. Therefore, the eighty-three newly manufactured steel cabinets from the Vocational Education Exhibition were borrowed in their entirety. The Railway Department provided free transportation from Tianjin to Beijing, and the association only paid for the ferry fee of 156 yuan. The installation was also undertaken by workers dispatched by the Railway Department, which was very convenient. In addition, the association custom-made 180 trapezoidal stands, 80 picture stands, 300 wooden stands, and some wooden boards, spending a total of 1,300 to 1,400 yuan. After the closing of the exhibition, the trapezoidal stands could be used by small merchants to display goods and by households to display potted flowers, and the hanging stands could be converted into bookshelves, so that they would not be completely useless. The design was carefully considered. The association first installed all kinds of display cabinets, and then invited representatives from various provinces and the exhibition committee members to jointly display the exhibits. At the same time, many temporary workers were needed, and the venue was bustling. The exhibits were arranged according to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, first vocational, then secondary, and then primary. Because the styles and structures of the exhibits were very complex, classification was quite difficult. The display started on November 13th and lasted until the 18th, a total of five days, during which all the pavilions completed their arrangements. The representatives from various provinces and the exhibition committee members worked hard, and their insights were extremely rich. They even added night shifts twice to rush the work to completion, which shows how intense the work was. Finally, on the 29th and 30th, the entire preparatory committee, together with the representatives from various provinces, jointly inspected and reorganized the order. The display work was then completed. The Vice Minister and Chief Secretary of the Ministry even personally inspected the venue for a week, which shows that the Ministry attached great importance to this exhibition.</p>
<h3>(2) Financial Situation</h3>
<p>The association's budget, before the venue was determined, was estimated at over 11,000 yuan, all of which was saved from expenses in order to make ends meet. After the venue was determined, one was the cost of protecting the examination hall building, which was about two thousand yuan, and the other was the cost of careful arrangement and striving for order, which was about four or five hundred yuan more. The third was that, because the examination hall was borrowed, at least half of the water and electricity fees had to be paid, which was about three or four hundred yuan. These two items were about three thousand yuan. In addition, there were slight increases in items such as the installation of a wireless radio receiver and the custom-made badges. The wooden frames made by the various pavilions for special exhibits also accounted for a portion of the expenses, thus consuming several hundred yuan. The exhibition period was originally scheduled for ten days, but it has now been extended by two days, plus two days for judging, for a total of fourteen days, which will also require increased expenditures. All of these were not included in the original budget, and the committee members are trying to tighten their belts in order to avoid exceeding the budget too much. The venue layout has already been completed. The major expenses after this will be the aftercare, salaries, printing, and organization, which are relatively large. The reporter has seen the standing committee members of the association walking back and forth from the Ministry of Education to the Examination Yuan in recent days, which shows the extent of their frugality.</p>
<h3>(3) Organizational Situation</h3>
<p>The organization of the association is a preparatory committee, with five standing committee members appointed by the Minister. Underneath it are two committees, the Exhibition and Arrangement Committee and the Judging Committee, and two groups, the General Affairs Group and the Editorial Group, each with a director. The director of the Exhibition and Arrangement Committee is Inspector Tang Xifen, the director of the Judging Committee is Si Gu Shusen, the director of the General Affairs Group is Inspector Gu Zhaolin, and the director of the Editorial Group is Inspector Zhou Bangdao. Under the groups are sections, with section chiefs and staff members, mostly concurrently held by members of the Ministry, with only a few outsiders. The exhibition committee members are concurrently held by the preparatory committee members, and representatives and other members of the Ministry also serve as staff members. The members of the Judging Committee are experts from the education and business sectors who have been invited to serve, and more than ten people have been internally appointed and are currently seeking their consent. The General Affairs Group has a general secretary and a general affairs, accounting, and reception section. During the exhibition period, the representatives from various provinces serve as reception staff, and the rest are staffed by members of the Ministry on a rotational basis, with two people in each pavilion. During the opening period, there are two general commanders in the venue, Hao Gengsheng, who is responsible for leading the venue staff and the Boy Scouts to maintain order throughout the venue. Since the opening, the situation has been different. In addition to the full attendance of all standing committee members every day, all preparatory committee members and staff members take turns to go to take care of things, so that when special circumstances arise, they can find ways to help at any time. According to Gu Zhaolin, the director of general affairs of the association, the order outside the door on the mornings of the 1st and 2nd was not good, and the staff issuing tickets did not handle the situation properly. Additional staff have now been assigned to correct the situation. However, many of the staff members in the association are concurrently employed and not enough to allocate, and limited by funding, they cannot increase the number of staff. We hope that all sectors will forgive any shortcomings that arise." His words expressed a sense of sadness, which shows that the handling of affairs is not without difficulties.</p>
<h3>(4) Venue Situation</h3>
<p>The layout of the venue is generally tidy, but the turns in the second and fourth pavilions are too narrow, and the audience is prone to crowding. Many people from all walks of life have also mentioned this point in their criticisms in recent days. The person in charge of the association said that the aisles in the venue were originally designed to be four feet wide, enough for three people to pass through, but because the venue was small and the exhibits sent by the provinces were too many, it was not convenient to reduce the size of the exhibits. Therefore, the number of wooden frames was repeatedly increased, resulting in slightly narrower aisles, which was a last resort. However, even with this arrangement, only three-quarters of the original exhibits could be displayed, and one-quarter could not be accommodated. "If the aisles are widened for the convenience of pedestrians, what will be the basis for judging?"</p>
<p>Although the audience has been very crowded in recent days, the order in the venue can still be maintained with effort. However, on the morning of the 2nd, a woman fainted in the first pavilion and was rescued out of the venue by the Boy Scouts. Also, a child fell under a wooden frame on the podium of the fourth pavilion and was helped up by a representative from Hubei. Also, a staff member lost a pen, which was picked up and returned by a worker. Also, the Qingdao City lost a pair of gloves, and Jiangsu Province lost a clock. At that time, there were still no major losses. In addition, there is too much dust in the venue, which is indeed a shortcoming. According to the management staff of the association, "The venue is swept once every day after closing the door, and sometimes a night shift is added. The cleaning is completed at four o'clock in the morning every night, which cannot be said to be insufficient. But after ten o'clock in the morning, the dust rises again. The reason is that the floating dust under the shoes of the audience flies up, which is difficult to prevent. Now the windows and doors cannot be closed, so the electric fans on the walls can only be turned on and off at any time to adjust the situation. We are currently thinking of various ways to facilitate the audience."</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Subsidizes the Promotion of Vocational Education in Chahar Province</h3>
<p>Allocates 100,000 Yuan to be Used for the Livestock Department and Afforestation of Vocational Schools</p>
<p>Wang Jiruo, Section Chief of the Chahar Provincial Department of Education, attended the National Vocational Education Discussion Meeting convened by the Ministry of Education. In a recent interview, he said that after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek inspected the province, he generously allocated 100,000 yuan annually from the Nanchang Headquarters (50,000 yuan has already been allocated), with 30,000 yuan for afforestation expenses, 20,000 yuan for running the livestock department of vocational schools, 10,000 yuan for subsidizing school military training, and 40,000 yuan for promoting mass education outside the pass. Currently, the Provincial Department of Education has opened a livestock department in vocational schools, and next year will continue to promote the school system for compulsory education, first running joint rural normal schools to train teachers and provide Mongolian language instruction to facilitate the promotion of primary schools outside the pass for the League Flag children. To promote mass education, it is planned to organize a mobile lecture tour group with several cars, divided into four departments: lecture, health, art, education, and film. They will set off for a 20-day mobile lecture tour in various places outside the pass every month. Such a method of promoting mass education is also a novel approach. It is also heard that representatives of the Provincial Department of Education have consulted with the Ministry of Education to introduce provinces and cities that have self-made educational films (such as Jiangsu) to rent more educational films and prepare to bring them to Chahar Province for application after the vocational education discussion meeting.</p>

With the mobilization of the entire city, the results should be more than 50,000 yuan. It is reported that the school authorities decided to complete the donation in the morning in order to facilitate the students' travel and avoid repeated donations, as the Boy Scouts will be conducting street fundraising today.</p>
<h3>The Beiping Education Delegation Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Visited the City Center Area This Afternoon</p>
<p>The Beiping Municipal Primary and Secondary School Education Delegation arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday.

<h3>Military Training for High School Students in This City Will Be Conducted in a Centralized Training Next Year</h3>
<p>Training for Three Months from April to July</p>
<p>It is Said That the Training Site May Be the Shanghai Road Racecourse</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education and the Training Supervision Department have decided that from next year, all military training students in senior high schools and equivalent schools in all provinces and cities must undergo three months of centralized training before the summer vacation. In this city, the National Military Training Committee is responsible for the preparations. The period will run from April to July next year. However, there are more than 70 schools in this city that implement military training, and the number of military training students exceeds several thousand. It is difficult to find a suitable training venue for a while. During this year's summer military training, the location also encountered difficulties, so the method of separate training by each school in stages was adopted. However, the centralized training to be held next year cannot adopt this method. It is said that it is planned to borrow the Shanghai Racecourse as a training venue. The location of the racecourse is large and quite suitable. Once the negotiation is completed, it can be decided. All military training students from all schools must participate in this training. Students who have received military training and obtained a team certificate during this year's summer training will receive preferential treatment when participating in the centralized training next year. As for schools above the specialized level who did not participate in the summer military training this year, they will still need to make up for the training next year.</p>

<h3>Awards Given for the Beijing Central Cup Basketball Tournament</h3>
<p>National Sports and May Thirtieth Teams Receive Large Silver Cups</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 7th) The awards ceremony for the Central Cup Basketball Tournament was held at 10:00 AM on the 7th in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters. All members of the National Sports, Military Academy, May Thirtieth, White Team, and Central Pen Team who participated in the competition attended.

<h3>Xiqing Basketball Last Night Xiqing Defeats Chizhi by a Large Margin</h3>
<p>Jewish Wins Against White Cat in Group B... Leidian Wins Against Lingnan</p>
<p>There were two Group B matches and one Group A match in Xiqing basketball last night. The results were: (1) Group A: Xiqing defeated Chizhi. The first half was 36 to 7, and the overall result was 72 to 21. (2) Group B: Jewish defeated White Cat. The first half was 25 to 7, and the overall result was 42 to 18. (3) Group B: Leidian defeated Lingnan. The first half was 29 to 7, and the overall result was 98 to 23.</p>
<h3>Xiqing Defeats Chizhi</h3>
<p>This battle formed a one-sided situation, which was expected. Although Chizhi knew that they were no match, they worked hard throughout and did not dare to slack off. Chen Yunfan performed the best, running back and forth and being extremely active. He is indeed a talent in the team. Xiqing did not encounter strong opponents yesterday, so they easily let newcomers on the court, resulting in the team's cooperation not being particularly good, and only relying on personal skills to win the victory.</p>

<h3>All Finals of the Zhongqing Volleyball Tournament Tonight</h3>
<p>Standard Cup: Jiangwan vs. Zhenru Team</p>
<p>Dahua Cup: Qiangwei vs. Zhirenyong</p>
<p>The Zhongqing Volleyball League will hold the Dahua and Standard Cup tournaments this year. Since they began on October, all the battle records of each group are very clear. Zhenru and Jiangwan have five wins in five games in "Standard A." Tonight, the dragons and tigers will fight each other for the championship. Each team is sure to fight to the utmost of their ability. The strengths of Qiangwei and Zhirenyong in "Dahua" are balanced, with each team having one win and one loss. A battle to the death is expected. Dongwu in "Standard B" has won every game and will face the strong enemy White Team tonight. The team must fight to the death. To achieve this, tonight's battles will be gathered at the Hai Ten Club, making it a colorful and grand event. It is heard that the association only sells 100 seated tickets to limit the crowding of spectators (each ticket is 4 jiao). Players who hold the association's player card are limited to watching from the upper floor to ensure good order. The battle schedule is attached below:</p>

<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Fawning Laughter Meets Lamp Illuminates, Careworn Hungry Gut Drives Painted Wind and Flow</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was a teapot on the table. After pouring it out, the two of them drank it all. Only then did Little Ji come in smiling, carrying many things, and when she put them on the table and looked, there were washbasins, towels, mirrors, soap boxes, snow creams, powder boxes, and rouge creams. He said to Aunt Hu: "You dress her up." After saying that, she ran out and brought in a pot of hot water. She ran out again and brought in a package of clothes. Seeing that Yueying was still sitting upright and proper, she straightened her face and said, "Little girl, why don't you do something? You need to know that running around like this is all for you, and it's not that I'm greedy for any benefits. I want to say something that is not very considerate, if you had a way, would you have made me, a tea room worker, send you these pot pieces that you've already eaten?" Yueying couldn't help but blush when she heard this. Aunt Hu said, "Did you even have to say that? Our young lady has some pride, but because she was too hungry yesterday, and there was really no way, she barely came this morning." Little Ji said, "Here you come again. Since you've come, of course you're hoping that things will be successful. Wash your face, change your clothes, and let people be happy when they see you, wouldn't that be good? If you feel embarrassed with me here, I'll leave. That Master Jia is probably up. Maybe he'll go out in the morning, you better go a little earlier." Saying that, he closed the door for them and left first. Aunt Hu said, "Yueying, there's a mirror here, you can do it yourself." Yueying frowned and said, "If that's the case, wouldn't I become someone who sells flirtations? Auntie, you think, I'm already ashamed to death by showing my face like this, and if I dress up for people to see, where would I put this face of mine?" Aunt Hu said, "Who doesn't say that? But you have to think that if it wasn't for thickening this face today, we wouldn't have these pot pieces to eat. You also have to remember that there are two people at home who must be starving for who knows how long. We're still counting on Little Ji's dollar." (84)</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Shi Liangcai</h3>
<p>— Wo Fo</p>
<p>Originally, Mr. Shi Liangcai and I had no ties of hometown, kinship, family friendship, scholarly association, or personal friendship. I originally did not need to announce my grief for Mr. Shi, which I kept in my heart, to the world through writing. However, the assassination of Mr. Shi this time has given me such deep feelings. In order to express these feelings, I cannot help but write this article.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi's assassination this time is truly worthy of mourning, and at the same time, it is most worthy of admiration. On the other hand, it makes people feel endless emotion; because Mr. Shi could have avoided being assassinated, Mr. Shi's assassination this time can also be said to be self-inflicted. However, this point is precisely Mr. Shi's extraordinary greatness.</p>
<p>The only principle that Chinese people hold is enjoyment. Therefore, as long as they can escape the environment of struggle and shouting in their lives, they will live in seclusion, enjoying the material pleasures in a leisurely and comfortable manner. No matter how much the country needs them, how much society needs them, or how much public welfare undertakings need them, they are always unwilling to adapt to the needs, to step into the world and shoulder their responsibilities, and to exert their abilities. This principle is certainly advantageous and victorious for them personally, but what kind of obstacles will it bring to the country, society, public welfare undertakings, and other aspects? Now, Mr. Shi is different. Considering his position and wealth, he could have lived comfortably in an ivory tower, enjoying a life of ease. Moreover, Mr. Shi had already made great contributions in the past, so even if he enjoyed himself in the future, he would have lived up to the country, society, and public welfare undertakings. However, Mr. Shi always broke away from individualism and always served the public. Even a wealthy person would not sit under a dangerous wall, but Mr. Shi still tirelessly toiled in the world. Although Mr. Shi's assassination may have been due to his unwillingness to enjoy himself and his dedication to service, Mr. Shi's spirit of preferring service and not fearing assassination is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Finally, I think Mr. Shi's assassination may be because there are too few people like Mr. Shi in this society. Alas!</p>
<h3>A Meng and the Green Peony</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The green peony is a rare flower among chrysanthemums; because this kind of chrysanthemum has very wide petals, a very large flower head, and especially its color, which is a deep green with a touch of deep blue, and the flower pistils are even more green and vibrant, which is its characteristic; like the Caotang in Luxu, the Ancient Flower Tower of the Hu family in Chengxiang, the Salt Warehouse in Nanli, and the Ruizhi Righteous Village outside Ximen, although there are many varieties, none of them are as good as the chrysanthemum in the Municipal Junior Middle School in the North Gate, which once gained a reputation for its campus gardening just because of this pot of green peony!</p>
<p>The school has been growing chrysanthemums for many years, but is the planting and irrigation entrusted to a florist? Not exactly, but it is entrusted to one of the school's janitors, and to achieve this result is really not easy! This janitor is called A Meng by everyone in the school, and the name of Xin A Meng is well known even outside the school; because he is very loyal to his duties and has never made any mistakes that people can criticize, the chrysanthemums he grows are exceptionally beautiful and famous, so everyone attributes the credit to A Meng; some people say, "A Meng" can be called a chrysanthemum slave, because he is already over fifty years old, and all his teeth have fallen out, and the male and female students in the school all call him an old woman. However, A Meng often pursed his lips and said when he heard this: "Old woman, you! Look at the chrysanthemums I grow, aren't they like seventeen or eighteen-year-old young men and modern ladies?"</p>
<p>This time, the green peony, introduced by a certain gentleman, participated in the Qingyang Port Chrysanthemum Exhibition and took the first place. A Meng naturally heard this news and couldn't help but smile happily; alas! Who knew that when this pot of green peony went out, it had a total of thirteen flowers in good order, but when it returned, in the eyes of others, it just looked like a student who had won the final victory in the sports field and returned triumphantly; A Meng planted this pot of green peony with his own hands, and in his heart, it was like his own son. He took a close look at the green peony and couldn't help but sigh and say: "Why are there only twelve flowers now out of thirteen flowers?" He was almost so anxious that tears were about to fall; recently, when someone asked about the green peony, he still grumbled that people really had no public virtue!</p>
<h3>Song of the Sweater Dog</h3>
<p>— Shan Gong</p>
<p>Seen on North Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Strange things in the world are everywhere, just look at today's sweater dog, how lucky the dog is to wear a sweater, it should know to follow the master's great kindness, a modern Chinese girl, holding a dog walking on the street, she kindly made cold clothes for it in the cold weather, knitting a sweater with delicate hands, an overcoat is ironed and draped over it, tightly tied at the waist with buttons, in the past, I heard that there were monkeys rewarded with purple robes, dogs are also eager to be first, how can they be willing to lag behind, the dog now wears grace and jumps wildly, either first or last, left or right, the owner is also not lonely, walking forward, looking back. Alas, this year the world is in turmoil, poor people are carrying burdens selling their children, their voices are hoarse and exhausted, enduring cold and hunger, but the dog is full of beef and tired of chewing, it is like finding people and dogs posting advertisements, the price of people is not as high as the price of dogs, can a person be inferior to a dog, who can detail the reason for this, love it and want to add it to the knee, and be more adorned with beautiful clothes as a spectacle, dog, dog, unparalleled encounter, praise your master for endless blessings. I heard that the ancients valued universal love, treating people with benevolence and loving creatures, why is it reasonable to despise people and value animals, heaven and earth have no use to lightly sigh, alas! Strange things in the world are everywhere, just look at today's sweater dog.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Juan)</p>
<p>It has been more than ten days since the day that Premier Shi was killed. With the Premier's uprightness and peacefulness, there was no reason to be killed, but he could not avoid being killed in the end. What was the reason? To this day, no one can explain it. Can the Premier's eyes be closed in peace? Today, the colleagues of this newspaper will hold a memorial service at the Lake Society. I will bring a bucket of hot tears and wave them before the Premier's spirit. If the soul has knowledge, perhaps it can give us some enlightenment. Alas! God is silent, where can the wise find solace? I am filled with grief and despair.</p>
<h3>The Fragrant Shadows of the Imperial Palace</h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Leaving the second courtyard, we entered the third courtyard. Everyone who went in here was careful to restrain themselves, not daring to make any noise. Because the relics stored in this courtyard would surely make the Empress Dowager immediately recall a very bitter part of her own history as soon as she saw them. The facts contained in this history were nothing more than hardship, pain, terror, sorrow, struggle, and many heartbreaking tragedies; undoubtedly, this was a very painful memory. If it could be avoided, I think the Empress Dowager would never want to recall it often, but the pile of relics displayed before her eyes was the relics of her own husband - Emperor Xianfeng, and as soon as they caught her eye, they inevitably aroused her painful memories.</p>
<p>When she first entered the palace, she was selected along with sixteen other Manchu girls. All seventeen of them were beautiful and charming like flowers; but Xianfeng only fell in love with her alone, and soon officially made her a concubine, and she was the most favored in the palace.</p>
<p>Of course, the Empress Dowager was the most detailed and clear about Xianfeng's history; second only to Li Lianying; but at that time, Li Lianying was just a teenager, and he may not have had such a clear understanding. As for us - Guangxu, Empress Longyu, Consort Jin, and our eight female officials - each of us probably knew a little, all indirectly from listening to others; and among them, I heard the most! Because the Empress Dowager talked to me the most, and every time we talked, she couldn't help but recall the past, and there were many things in these past events that involved Xianfeng. (194)</p>
<p>Travels</p>
<h3>A Visit to West Lake in Autumn</h3>
<p>— Aisheng</p>
<p>I found the "Autumn Visiting Gathering" of the West Lake Butterfly Hotel in a newspaper advertisement. It said: The beauty of the red leaves surpasses the spring flowers. This kind of wording is not easy to find in advertisements. Moreover, the ticket, car, accommodation, food, and travel are all included. A two-day stay for a couple costs only thirty yuan, which is really a cheap and elegant thing, so we also became a member of the "Autumn Visiting Gathering."</p>
<p>We took a second-class train, and the tickets were prepared by the Butterfly Hotel. When we arrived at the Hangzhou Railway Station, we saw the "Butterfly" reception, wearing uniforms to greet us. At the same time, there were many members of the "Autumn Visiting Gathering," all in pairs. We estimated that they were at least couples, but we didn't recognize them.</p>
<p>We stepped onto the Butterfly Hotel's guest car from the station. The car body was very gorgeous and spacious, the size of a public bus, but the inside was equipped with sofas. I counted, and there were exactly six pairs including us. They probably all came to visit the autumn scenery, so they smiled at each other, because we would be traveling together tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Butterfly Hotel is a fine hotel located north of the Broken Bridge, facing the lake and mountains. It is not aristocratic, but very gorgeous and elegant, with a red corridor winding to the bedroom. There seemed to be many flowers and trees planted outside, and there were also thrushes and mynahs raised, because it was late, the birdcages were covered with cage covers, and the birds were not coming to welcome you as usual. We ate Western food for dinner, which had a very "Merry" flavor.</p>
<p>The next morning, the waiter gently knocked on the door and said: "Sir! It's half past seven." I quickly sat up. The room was full of crystal light, basking in the morning sun. The red corridor was outside the window, the lake was outside the red corridor, and the mountains were outside the lake, all like a painting, one layer after another shining into my eyes. I quickly woke her up, and after washing up, we had breakfast.</p>
<p>It turned out that there were more than just the six pairs who came on the same car as us to "Visit Autumn." There were also those who came in advance and joined temporarily. I saw that the route started with a car to Siyan Well, and I wanted to not take the car and go by boat. The hotel said: "You can," we have boats prepared. This "Autumn Visiting Gathering" is absolutely free. We got off the boat from the willows and went straight to South Lake. The morning sun shone on the water, like silver.</p>
<p>The boat could not go any further when it reached Chishan Wharf. We abandoned the boat and walked straight to the Stone House Cave. The boat was slower than the car as usual. When we arrived at the Stone House Cave, the people from the Autumn Visiting Gathering had already been there. Two sedan chairs were parked outside the gate, originally waiting for us to sit in. We did not enter the temple and sat in the sedan chairs and went straight to Yanhua Cave. Along the way, the shade of the pine trees, there were about a few chestnut trees and ginkgo trees, dyed with bright red and delicate yellow colors. I thought the Butterfly Hotel's advertisement was a bit exaggerated. Who knew that as soon as we reached the foot of the mountain, looking towards the South Peak, every tree, high and low, looked like it was drunk, and every tree was bright. The autumn colors were like brocade, really not empty words. In the flower hall, on the stone table under the shade of the trees, many people were eating and drinking there. It turned out that a table was prepared for two people, and no one had to be constrained by anyone. The Butterfly Hotel's owner's thoughtfulness and thoroughness of equipment made me have to admire at this time.</p>
<p>After dinner, we circled around the front and back of the mountain, all of which was autumn scenery. There was also a place under construction, building a house, which was said to be designed and built by the owner of the Butterfly Hotel, named "Butterfly Hidden Garden," because there was originally a "Butterfly Hidden Garden" here that had been abandoned for a long time, and now it is being rebuilt, and the name also coincides very well. Mr. Ma Yichu already had a couplet hanging in the cave, and I seemed to remember a sentence like "East is Su Shi West Butterfly Hidden."</p>
<p>We took sedan chairs from Yanhua Cave to Longjing to Li'an. The autumn colors along the way were ever-changing, and we couldn't see enough. The Nine Creeks and Eighteen Streams had already been paved with roads, and cars could drive straight in. The Butterfly's special car had been waiting for a long time. We were still eating Butterfly Hotel snacks on the snow-white tea cloth in front of the Jiuxi Tea Field. This time, it was a long table, and name cards were arranged in order to sit. We exchanged name cards with each other at the table. A day's tour just made us meet five or six friends who liked mountains and rivers, and we also left our names and praises on the signature book specially prepared by the Butterfly Hotel. The car arrived at Xucun at half past five. The planned tour of the Six Harmonies Pagoda was canceled, and we hurriedly boarded the gate train and went straight to Shanghai.</p>
<p>This kind of travel method is indeed worthy of attention and praise in the travel business. But this year's Autumn Visiting Gathering has ended. Revisit the old place, look forward to next year.</p>

<h3>Morse Code Practice Machine for Both Telegraphy and Telephony</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>If you are tired of playing with radio broadcast wavelengths, we should change our taste and try shortwave. Shortwave can be used for amateur communication, and it has super characteristics. You will be very interested in the experiment. We read O.S.T. and admire the activity of American amateurs, who often help the country's telecommunications traffic where it cannot reach; my country has a vast territory, and telecommunications traffic is still in its infancy, so many amateurs are needed to rise up and work for the country within the amateur range. To become an amateur, the first thing is to understand Morse code and be proficient in sending and receiving. This article introduces a Morse code practice machine for both telegraphy and telephony, which is also suitable for basic practice for beginners.</p>
<p>The Morse code practice machine is very easy to manufacture and costs very little. The required parts can all be replaced by those used in broadcast machines. Please refer to the attached diagram for the circuit. This machine is suitable for two people to practice. The intermediate distance can be arbitrarily tested, and it is connected with a double twisted wire of appropriate length. If the wire is too long and there is static interference, the outside of the wire must be isolated with a lead sheath. If it is for convenience, it is also possible to test using a single wire and ground circuit. In the figure, T is an audio frequency transformer. V is a vacuum tube, preferably of the 99 or 30 type, which is more economical to use. P is a receiver R is a 20-ohm current regulator. C is a fixed capacitor with a value from .005 to .08 megamicrofarads. If it is too large, the tone will be deep and blurry. KS is a key and switch. A is A battery, B is B battery, and the voltage is determined by the characteristics of the required vacuum tube. After matching the application parts and connecting them as shown in the figure, you can invite a comrade to test it.</p>
<p>During the test, if the sending operator at station B sends the message first, the switch at station A must be closed; when the sending operator at station B presses the key, the receiving operator at station A can receive a clear Morse code tone. After listening to the Morse code, party A immediately turns off the switch, presses the key to send the message, and after sending, closes the switch again, waiting for party B to reply. You can practice back and forth in this way.</p>
<p>This machine can also be used for telephony testing. When telephoning, the switch at station A must be closed first. The speakers at both stations each speak into a receiver and listen to a receiver. However, the voice must be heavy when speaking, otherwise the receiver diaphragm will not vibrate and the other party will hear nothing. The total impedance of the receivers used must be equal to achieve the best effect.</p>
<p>When this machine is used for sending test, attention must be paid to whether the oscillator is oscillating. Check whether the circuit is connected incorrectly. The second step is to exchange the wiring of the two transformers to test it.</p>
<h3>Important Points Regarding the Structure of High-Frequency Amplifiers</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>(A) Capacitance due to high frequency</p>
<p>What is capacitance? The most obvious thing is a capacitor, two pieces close to each other, with capacitance. However, the grid and screen in the vacuum tube face each other, and the parallel arrangement of each circuit is a capacitor and has capacitance. The resistance generated by capacitance is called capacitive reactance. According to the formula, capacitive reactance is the frequency, and C is the capacitance. If the value of capacitance is constant, the degree of capacitive reactance depends on the size of the frequency. According to the formula, when the value of C is constant, the larger the value of f, the smaller the value of Xc. Therefore, it can be proved that the higher the frequency, the smaller the capacitive reactance, because the current on the radio frequency amplification circuit is high frequency, then the capacitive reactance in the circuit is reduced, so that the high frequency current is often easy to exceed the normal track, which is easy to cause various obstacles, such as oscillation, etc., making the radio reception chaotic. Therefore, when constructing an amplification receiver, the connecting lines used in each part are most afraid of being parallel and in close contact with each other. We must try to make the connecting lines perpendicular to each other to reduce the valley effect to the lowest limit.</p>
<p>(B) Position of the transformer</p>
<p>There are magnetic lines around the transformer. If it is an iron core, these magnetic lines will adhere to the iron core to form a magnetic circuit, and there will be less external magnetic force. However, because there is nothing to rely on for the magnetic lines of the air core transformer, there are many stray magnetic lines around it. It is especially severe at both ends of the coil. If several similar transformers are installed close to each other and connected to each other, they will interfere with each other, resulting in violent oscillation or reduced efficiency. We must remember not to touch other devices closely around the transformer when installing it. When several transformers are installed together, they must be perpendicular to each other or parallel to each other (each distance should be at least two inches or more). Some people advocate that the transformer should be installed at an oblique angle of 40 degrees to the ground plane so that it will not interact with the earth's magnetic force.</p>
<p>(C) Vacuum tube selection</p>
<p>Various vacuum tubes have the ability to amplify, but some vacuum tubes can be used for both detection and amplification, while others are specifically for amplification. Vacuum tubes for amplification are nothing more than hard tubes, which are better. The so-called hard vacuum tube is a glass bulb with an extremely high degree of vacuum so that the screen can withstand a relatively high voltage.</p>
<p>Because the amplification characteristics of vacuum tubes are very good, some people advocate that the amplification effect of vacuum tubes should be used purely on the amplifier. Although using a transformer can increase the amplification ability, it is not easy to get good results using a transformer with a large ratio, because the AC voltage received by the grid of the vacuum tube and the DC voltage it receives have certain limitations. A high-ratio transformer often causes the grid of the vacuum tube in the later stage to receive too high an AC voltage, resulting in abnormal current and oscillation action. Adding more vacuum tube stages is more likely to get satisfactory results.</p>
<p>(D) Adjustment of grid voltage</p>
<p>In a vacuum tube for amplification, a negative voltage of a C battery is often added to the grid. However, various vacuum tubes have their own characteristics and have mutual differences. The C voltage used for the grid cannot be generalized. The voltage of the C battery cannot be adjusted arbitrarily, so it is more convenient to adjust the grid voltage with a voltage divider. However, the voltage divider is directly connected to the two poles of the A battery group, and a suitable total switch must be used. When not in use, the current can be cut off to avoid unnecessary loss. Looking at the above four types, although they seem ordinary, we must pay attention to them when constructing a high-frequency amplifier. Therefore, the four types mentioned above are the main points of the construction of a high-frequency amplifier.</p>
<h3>A Sensitive Short-Wave Single-Tube Radio</h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>Using a No. 33 audio frequency amplification tube as a detector, its sensitivity is indeed much higher than that of an ordinary No. 30 vacuum tube. The long-short wave one-lamp radio described in this article uses a No. 33 vacuum tube as a feedback detector, so its sensitivity is indeed very superior; it has used ordinary broadcast radio antennas to receive short-wave broadcasts from the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as countless short-wave telegrams, and the volume is also very loud. Using its broadcast coil to listen to local telecommunications, the sound in the receiver is deafening. Therefore, it is introduced.</p>
<p>The circuit of this machine is not particularly unique, so it is very easy to construct, but you must be careful when making it in order to obtain satisfactory results. The machine uses a 50,000-ohm variable resistance to adjust the screen grid voltage of the No. 33 vacuum tube to control the feedback force, and the feedback effect is very stable. A total of four plug-in coils are used to receive each segment of wavelength, and the number of turns and wire number are as follows:</p>
<p>WavelengthL1L2Distance between L1 and L220 meters4 turns6 turns1/4 inch60 meters18 turns16 turns3/16 inch100 meters50 turns30 turns3/16 inchBroadcast segment1516 inches58 inches1/8 inch</p>
<p>Except for the L1 of the 20 and 60-meter segments, which uses a No. 26 double-yarn covered wire, the rest of the coils use a No. 26 enameled wire.</p>
<p>Its circuit is as shown in the attached diagram. The other parts in the diagram have been marked, so they will not be repeated here. All other parts should use high-quality products, otherwise it will affect its performance. A small 25-ampere-hour storage battery is best used for the A battery, or two dry batteries can be connected in series and the 66-ohm variable resistance can be reduced to 2 volts. 45 volts is enough for the B battery, and the maximum should not exceed 67 volts. The panel should use an aluminum plate (at this time, R must be insulated from the panel). All wiring should be short and straight, and all joints should be soldered with tin to obtain excellent results.</p>
<h3>Two Improved Three-Circuit Crystal Radio Circuits</h3>
<p>— Cai Rixin</p>
<p>The three-circuit is the best type of crystal radio, which is recognized by everyone. Indeed, its volume is much louder than that of an ordinary single-wire circuit, but the selectivity is not very good, which is very annoying: the author tested two methods for two weeks in order to increase its selectivity, and the result is the two methods in Figure 1 and Figure 2. (The figures are attached separately)</p>
<p>The results of these two circuits are both excellent. According to my observation after testing, Figure 2 is better than Figure 1. The filter in Figure 1 is not as effective as that in Figure 2. If you have a three-circuit crystal radio and feel that the selectivity is not good, you may want to try it. LL1L2, ordinary three-circuit coils are also acceptable.</p>
<p>L - No. 24 wire, wound 12 turns on the bead board.</p>
<p>L1 - No. 24 wire, wound 58 turns on the bead board.</p>
<p>L2 - No. 26 wire, wound 34 turns on the bead board.</p>
<p>L3 - No. 26 wire, wound 50 turns on a one-time diameter cylinder.</p>
<p>L4 - No. 26 wire, wound 22 turns on a cylinder, 7/8 inch apart.</p>
<p>L5 - No. 26 wire, wound 70 turns on a one-inch diameter cylinder, with a tap every ten turns.</p>
<p>C - 0.0003 megamicrofarad variable capacitor.</p>
<p>C - 0.00025 megamicrofarad variable capacitor.</p>
<p>D - Sensitive ore.</p>
<p>LL1L2 is installed on a three-circuit rack.</p>
<h3>Filter Circuit</h3>
<p>— Qing Zhao</p>
<p>If you want to design a radio with better selectivity, you must choose a good filter circuit to cope with it in order to remove unnecessary mixed sounds and increase its selectivity. The following figures A, B, and C show several excellent filter circuits. Figure A makes the LsCs circuit match the mixed sound wavelength and gives it a low-impedance path, so that unnecessary radio frequencies flow through it without flowing into the radio. In this way, the mixed sounds in the radio can be screened out. Figure B connects a small coil Ls between the antenna and ground ends of the radio, so that the LsCs circuit intersects with LC and is matched with the wavelength to be received, then LC is affected by the reaction of this circuit. As a result, the total impedance at the LC end is often the largest for the frequency to be received; however, for other frequencies, the value of its total impedance is low, so it can achieve the purpose of screening out mixed sounds. Figure C shows that the CsLs circuit is first matched with the mixed sound frequency, and the LtCt circuit is matched with the frequency to be received. Because the circuit is too complicated, it is not easy for unskilled people to adjust it.</p>
<h3>Daily Difficulties and Remedies on the Radio</h3>
<p>— Zhenmin</p>
<p>When using radios, we often encounter various difficulties, such as not receiving any signal, weak sound, noise, etc. The occurrence of these phenomena is not necessarily due to errors in the components of your radio. Sometimes, it is the result of neglecting a small part. Inexperienced people often panic when encountering the above-mentioned difficulties and replace components without considering the consequences, which often makes the radio even worse. After discovering a difficulty, it is best to carefully inspect each part of the radio and then make appropriate repairs. The following points are the most common difficulties encountered in daily radio use. Now, let's briefly explain their causes and remedies.</p>
<p>(1) No Reception (No sound in the earpiece or loudspeaker)</p>
<p>Cause Remedy</p>
<p>(A) Broken circuit Inspect the circuit, carefully solder the joints, and tighten the screws.</p>
<p>(B) Transformer burnout Use a voltmeter to measure the voltage of the primary and secondary coils. If there is no reading on the meter, the transformer must be replaced.</p>
<p>(C) Poor vacuum tube Replace with a better vacuum tube.</p>
<p>(D) Battery depleted Charge.</p>
<p>(E) Insufficient B voltage or incorrect connection Replace or swap connections.</p>
<p>(F) Rust on the battery terminals Test with an ordinary light bulb (small bulb), then replace.</p>
<p>(G) Damaged or burnt variable resistor Test first, then replace.</p>
<p>(H) Poor contact of the earpiece plug Test first, and try to increase the contact area.</p>
<p>(I) Poor contact of the vacuum tube socket Test first, and tighten the screws.</p>
<p>(J) Internal short circuit in the earpiece plug Remove the plug and test, then test with another plug, and then replace.</p>
<p>(K) Cracked earpiece wire Replace with another wire.</p>
<p>(L) Incomplete contact of the earpiece wire Remove the earpiece cover and try to tighten the wire end.</p>
<p>(M) Partial contact of the variable capacitor Test with a light bulb. If the light bulb lights up, then replace it.</p>
<p>(N) Antenna and ground wire not connected properly Carefully inspect the circuit and connect them tightly.</p>
<p>(2) Weak Reception</p>
<p>Cause Remedy</p>
<p>(1) Loose circuit contacts Inspect the circuit, tighten or re-solder.</p>
<p>(2) Rust or looseness at the antenna connection Clean it or re-solder it.</p>
<p>(3) Poor ground wire installation Test and re-install a better ground wire.</p>
<p>(4) Antenna in contact with branches or other conductors Inspect the antenna and try to remove this contact.</p>
<p>(5) Poor antenna insulation First connect the earpiece and C battery to the antenna and ground wire. If sound can be heard, the antenna must be replaced.</p>
<p>(6) Poor vacuum tube Replace with a better vacuum tube.</p>
<p>(7) Incomplete contact of the variable resistor Clean or replace.</p>
<p>(8) Battery exhausted Replace or charge.</p>
<p>(9) Defects in the earpiece or loudspeaker, or poor installation Install properly first. If the reception does not improve, it must be replaced.</p>
<p>(10) Improper configuration of radio frequency Pay close attention when tuning in. (Rotate the variable capacitor slowly)</p>
<p>(11) Radio waves absorbed by other steel structures Try to install a higher antenna. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>The train exhaled a long plume of black smoke, floating behind the carriage like a messy braid, scattered into the woods by the gale, disappearing in a moment.</p>
<p>As if tired of walking, it panted hoarsely, darting from this mountain to that mountain, always clattering incessantly. The people sitting in the train were long since hypnotized by this rhythmic sound.</p>
<p>Outside the train window were towering, overlapping mountains, covered with dark, lush forests and green, velvety thatch. The train ran all day in this desolate, lonely mountain wilderness, along the torrents of the Fu Liang River. Sometimes, it burrowed into gloomy tunnels, piercing straight through the massive belly of the mountain - the journey was unexpectedly so arduous.</p>
<p>It was already three or four o'clock in the afternoon, and Hekou seemed to be arriving soon. Suddenly, a misty drizzle began to fall, the scene outside the window gloomy. Besides three young people who had never been out before and were marveling at the scenery, there was a group (about seven or eight) of Annamese women who were sleeping soundly with their heads bowed, wearing coffee-colored long gowns, their teeth stained black, chewing mouthfuls of bright red betel nut. They were probably exhausted from the long journey and the bumpy ride.</p>
<p>Because of the language barrier, we never spoke a word to them. These fair-skinned, red-lipped foreigners, with thick black braids wrapped around their heads and wooden shoes that clattered as they walked, constantly made us stare in amazement at their every move. Especially the way they smoked: squatting on the floor, their backs firmly against the wall, striking a match, putting the waterless pipe to their mouths, and inhaling forcefully - after three or four minutes, they would slowly open their mouths and exhale the smoke, as if they felt very refreshed. Their appearance really made us unable to help but laugh!</p>
<p>The three of us young people sat in the train, feeling gloomy, each with our heads down, thinking about our own affairs. Unexpectedly, the rain outside the window started to pour down, and the train was climbing a steep slope very slowly. We felt hungry.</p>
<p>The train came to a mountain hollow and was suddenly blocked by a large rock that had fallen from the top of the mountain, derailing the locomotive. Fortunately, this was a mountain hollow, and there was no danger - if we were traveling on a path thousands of feet high, with mountain streams rushing by the side of the road, then, my God, everything would be over!</p>
<p>The train derailed, and many workers came to repair it, but the stone lying under the wheels was so difficult to remove. It seemed that the train could not be repaired and started until tomorrow. However, in this uninhabited mountain hollow, what were we going to do?</p>
<p>It gradually got dark, and we became even more hungry - we looked at each other, anxiously smiling bitterly! Fortunately, at this time, those Annamese Bodhisattvas in the same carriage saw our plight and generously took out the rice they had brought with them and shared it with us.</p>
<p>This rice was really strange: wrapped tightly in tree leaves, like dumplings. Although we found it a bit unsanitary, we devoured it ravenously.</p>
<p>When we returned the bamboo-woven lunch boxes to them, we were still a bit unsatisfied, but we smiled sheepishly and handed them back, feeling unspeakable gratitude in our hearts!</p>
<p>It was already night, and everyone saw that we could only sleep in the carriage tonight. So we closed the carriage windows and doors to prevent wild animals from coming, opened our luggage, and leaned against it to sleep.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, moonlight shone in through the cracks in the iron door, illuminating the carriage with a bright glow. Everyone thought it was dawn and hurried to open the iron door to take a look: the top of the mountain was covered with a layer of cloud-like white mist, connected to the white clouds in the sky. The clear light of the moon shone on the white mist, pure white, and indescribably beautiful - the trees and grass on the mountain... were quietly bathed in the moonlight, so gentle and lovely! As if they were already sound asleep. The still air was filled with a refreshing fragrance. In this vast and desolate place, only the distant, clear sound of the mountain spring was playing softly. It made people forget the hardships of the journey without realizing it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we only briefly enjoyed the wonderful night scene in this deep mountain for this one night. The next morning, we went to Lao Cai.</p>
<h3>Emphasis on Characteristics</h3>
<p>— Xinren</p>
<p>Emphasis on characteristics exists not only in art but also in natural science and social science. Natural scientists discovered that the main elements of water are hydrogen and oxygen, and further learned that water is a compound of two hydrogen and one oxygen, so they use H2O to represent water. However, actual water contains many other impurities besides these two elements. Social scientists study capitalist society and find out the main characteristics and laws: commodities, currency, etc. are the main characteristics, and panic, monopoly, war, and collapse are the main laws. They use these symbols to represent capitalist society; however, real capitalist society has infinitely complex phenomena. We cannot criticize the irreality of these scientific laws because of this abstract emphasis on characteristics.</p>
<p>Art is also like this, but it is not an abstract emphasis on characteristics but a concrete emphasis on characteristics. Anyone who asks Cervantes to find the real Don Quixote is a fool, because Don Quixote is a typical figure concretized by Cervantes, created through his work of emphasizing characteristics.</p>
<p>In short, emphasis on characteristics is necessary in both science and art. Without it in science, recognition cannot be concentrated; without it in art, the power to move art is lost. Especially the character of the characters in the work, if its characteristics are not emphasized, the loss is very great. Gladkov recently said: "…Modern huge images, guiding types, require writers to have great confidence…At this moment, a certain amount of idealization, a certain emphasis on the characteristics of personality, need not be feared." "Our focus should be…not portrait painting, but typical, not topical, but modern."</p>
<h3>Ibsen's Creative Method</h3>
<p>— Wang Jicong</p>
<p>(Part 1)</p>
<p>Mehring-Kautsky said: "Ibsen is an artist who denies all aesthetic forms. In the structure of his works, he is a classicist; in his deep poetic emotion, he is a romanticist. But if we further and spiritually study the personality of this poet, we may have to determine where he comes to a conclusion, that is, although he has various styles in form like Proteus (god of prophecy...), his fundamental nature is neither a naturalist, nor a classicist, nor a romanticist. In Ibsen's poems, social resistance and philosophical idealism, theoretically mixed with traditional social relations, exist." If we speak from the point of view of Ibsen's complexity as a great playwright, then Mehring-Kautsky's statement is of great significance. However, if we observe its complexity comprehensively, then we can know how Ibsen created and know what kind of literary school he belongs to. Because upon careful analysis, the creative methods of every great writer are almost very complex, but what determines their creative methods is only one thing - the content of the thoughts they want to express in their works; further, it is the era and society in which they are located. Ibsen is also the same. As long as we can start from this point and make a comprehensive and general observation, we can see the main trend of his creative method.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the so-called creative method is used to express certain things, certain thoughts and feelings. Leaving concrete things, leaving social thoughts and feelings, no creative method exists. Ibsen, who described the social phenomena of Norway in the second half of the nineteenth century, was an extreme individualist. His depiction of the social phenomena at that time was to express resistance to the society at that time under individualism. What about his creative method? Of course, it is used to express the social phenomena he wants to express, to express his individualism and spirit of resistance; in other words, it is derived from the content of his works. Therefore, first of all, in choosing themes, he cannot create with historical stories as themes like Goethe's "Faust" or Hugo's "Hernani". He must describe realistic social phenomena. His "A Doll's House", "Pillars of Society", "An Enemy of the People"…and other works all express real stories that can be found in Norwegian society at that time; the questions he raised in his creations about morality, religion, law, and even women are all realistic social issues: these are all obvious examples. Secondly, if Ibsen wants to resist the real society with the weapon of individualism, then he cannot abide by any formal rules, follow any principles of "character portrayal", like ordinary classicists; at the same time, he cannot be like the romanticists, fantasizing about things beyond reality and letting emotions run wild. For him, what is necessary is to vividly describe the living realistic social phenomena, because only in this way can the ugliness of reality be revealed (if that reality is ugly), and can his spirit of resistance be expressed. -- In this way, we can say that Ibsen is not a classicist, nor a romanticist, but should be attributed to the banner of naturalism. Ibsen himself once said in 1882: "The purpose of my writing books is to make every reader feel that everything he reads is fact." This is the argument held by general naturalists.</p>
<p>(Part 2)</p>
<p>However, the extreme individualist Ibsen's resistance to reality does not have a clear way out. He only violently attacks the morality, laws, and religion of the real society, and does not pay attention to the foundation of that real society that produces them. Therefore, he cannot go from resisting morality and law to a political outlet, which makes his general propaganda weak and ambiguous. As a result, the naturalist Ibsen put on the clothes of symbolism.</p>
<p>The so-called symbolism occurs when artists on the one hand want to resist reality, and on the other hand do not have clear ideas as a basis. Because there are no clear ideas, there will be no clear content, all there is is unconscious resistance; the result is of course no bright future, only "symbols", only sinking into the abyss of abstract "solipsism". Ibsen is like this. In all his plays, he is full of the spirit of resistance, but what is the result? They all end in a vague "purification of one's will", and even put all their efforts into longing for the heavens. For example, Nora's resistance to law, religion, and family in "A Doll's House" is for the sake of being a person; "Pillars of Society" has thoroughly exposed the hypocrisy of Norwegian citizens at that time, but the result tells us that personal freedom is more important than anything else; Dr. Stockmann in "An Enemy of the People" has also stubbornly fought against the old forces, but his central consciousness lies in "the strongest person in the world is the loneliest"; and Brand in "Brand" even puts his last efforts into longing for the heavens; others such as "The Lady from the Sea", "The Master Builder" and his last "When We Dead Awaken" all carry a strong smell of symbolism.</p>
<p>The strength of Ibsen's creation lies in his ruthless exposure of the evils of reality, his willingness to tell the truth, and his vivid depiction of the psychology and behavior of his petty-bourgeois protagonists. Some people say that he is an unparalleled petty-bourgeois psychologist, which is not without reason. I believe that anyone who studies the psychology of the petty bourgeoisie needs to read his works. In his plays, he often loves to use surprising scenes that people do not expect to grasp the psychology of general phenomena and to carry out his preaching. For example, in "A Doll's House", he initially portrays the protagonist Nora as very kind, like a "little dove", "little squirrel", making people not expect that such a person will resist, will leave home; but then he uses accidental events to stimulate her mind, making her show a firm spirit of resistance, pack her bags, and decide to leave. As a result, a surprising scene appears, the atmosphere of peace disappears, making the audience and actors as nervous as the author; so, taking this opportunity, Ibsen begins his preaching through Nora's mouth. -- Under such rules, Ibsen's creation has achieved great artistic effect. However, his symbolism has made his preaching ambiguous and weak, and thus has given his works great harm in art.</p>
<h3>Silent Thought</h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>Next to the small house, there is a lush locust tree. Although it is late autumn, not many leaves have fallen yet. The warm sunlight is tightly blocked, and the gloomy air sometimes gives me goosebumps all over my body.</p>
<p>Evening.</p>
<p>I sat under the window of this small house, watching the defeated, withered yellow locust leaves rolling down from the branches, falling on the ground, and being carried to the corner of the wall by the autumn wind.</p>
<p>--How poetic this is!</p>
<p>I thought silently. However, I am not a poet, I have neither the mood for appreciation nor any mysterious feelings. Only the past, like a fading dream, suddenly surfaced in my mind.</p>
<p>The first thing I thought of was the time five years ago when I lost my job and was at home in my hometown. At that time, I couldn't remember who was fighting whom, and soldiers were passing by every day, and no one in the village had escaped. - My hometown was originally in the deep mountains. It is said that except for the Boxer Rebellion, when foreign devils passed by once, it was this time. Foreign devils are really powerful, they kill and set fires, they do everything. So for the people there, it left the impression that "soldiers" are more terrible than "bandits." When soldiers come, the first thing to do is to escape. The old men would get angry when they saw that there was no one, and they would destroy things at will. In the end, not only were the people in the village gone, but also the things in the rooms were empty.</p>
<p>I remember the first time the soldiers hadn't arrived yet, my old father had already sent the people in the family to live at my aunt's house, and he and I were guarding the door at home. Sitting in the study - a study about the same size as my small house.</p>
<p>--They probably won't come today.</p>
<p>My father glanced at me.</p>
<p>--Xiao Fuzi just scouted out at Magouzhuang, there is no news at all.</p>
<p>--You might as well not come back! Living in Beijing, although there is nothing going on now, it is always more "alive" than at home. Now the road is so unsafe, when can you leave? In Beijing, you won't be as scared as you are at home!</p>
<p>--That's right!</p>
<p>--In the future, our life will be better... In another three years, your brother will also graduate...</p>
<p>My father showed a proud smiling face.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"Three years"? It's been five years now, hasn't it? "Life will be better" where is it? My old father has died because of excessive labor and worry. Although my younger brother has graduated, he is now unemployed at home. I once found him something to do. He said that the family is even harder to live these years and hopes that I will send some money back.</p>
<p>Money, where is there any to send! It was already not easy to maintain a small family with a few tens of dollars. What method do I have to arrange for my brother?</p>
<p>Father, brother, home, appeared before my eyes.</p>
<p>Dusk gradually ruled this world in misery.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow (11)</h3>
<p>— (Joseph Conrad) written, Wu Xiangyu translated</p>
<p>Captain Hagberd, annoyed at the mention of his clothes, took his shovel and went furtively inside; the two standing outside the door were startled by the sound of the door closing, followed by the sound of the door locking, and the echo of a feigned laugh inside.</p>
<p>After a short silence, the man said, "I don't want to disturb him." "What does all this mean? He's not very crazy."</p>
<p>"He's been worried about his lost son for a long time," Bessie said in a low, apologetic tone.</p>
<p>"Hey, I am his son."</p>
<p>"Harry!" she exclaimed - then fell into extreme silence.</p>
<p>"Know my name? Friend of the old man, eh?"</p>
<p>"He's our landlord," she murmured, while her hand gripped the iron railing.</p>
<p>"He owns both rabbit hutches, doesn't he?" Little Hagberd asked contemptuously, "That's what he thinks he can be proud of. Can you tell me, who is that fellow who's coming tomorrow? You must know part of the story. I tell you it's the old man's trick, nothing else."</p>
<p>She did not answer, she was helpless in the face of this insurmountable difficulty, and she was greatly surprised by this necessary, capable, and fearful event to explain. In this situation, she seemed to be involved in the madness.</p>
<p>"Ah! I am very sorry", she murmured.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" he said calmly. "You don't have to worry about causing me discomfort. That might be someone else when he wasn't expecting it at all, it would be uncomfortable. I'm not afraid of being hanged; but when that person shows up tomorrow, there's going to be a show. I don't want the old man's property, but rights are always rights. I shall see I'm going to fight that bastard, no matter who he is!"</p>
<p>He had come closer, he was much taller than her on that side of the iron railing. He spied on her hands. He guessed she was trembling, which suddenly made him think she might be involved in the old man's little trick against him tomorrow. He had come just in time to spoil their trick. He was attracted to this idea - with great contempt for the trick he had seen through. But he had always been extremely tolerant of all women's tricks in his life. Her trembling was indeed quite severe, and her headscarf slipped off her head. "Poor devil," he thought. "Don't worry about that fellow. I dare say he'll change his mind before tomorrow. But how to deal with me? I can't spend my time idling in front of this door until tomorrow morning."</p>

<h3>Financial Balancing Tax Increases by 2.5%, Gold Market Stabilizes After Weakness</h3>
<p>Struggled, Resulting in a 6-Jiao Drop</p>
<p>Buyer's Prospects Not Optimistic</p>
<p>The gold market has been continuously weak, and its future is extremely difficult to revive. This is because the swap rate is unfavorable to the bulls, and there are many reverse hedgers. In addition, large holders of spot goods jointly shorted a huge amount of tens of thousands of bars, which has really discouraged the buying sentiment. Early in the morning, the silver market in overseas markets rose uniformly in both the UK and the US. The forward silver price in Montreaux also rose by 3 li. Exchange rates have already rebounded. London pure gold fell by 4 pence. The over-the-counter pre-market trading opened, retreating to 85.6 yuan. The Central Bank's listing was announced, with the British rate flat and the US rate rising by 1.25. The Customs Gold Unit shrank by 4 li. The Standard Gold Bar price also retreated to 1012.3 yuan and continued to fall, once retreating to within 4 yuan. However, large holders bought on the dip, which allowed it to be maintained. Then it rebounded. After the opening, large holders sought a balance between supply and demand. The market situation was stable and fluctuated repeatedly. Then, due to banks' strong selling of US dollars, the foreign exchange market hardened and fell once. Quasi-large holders and speculators took advantage of the low price to buy strongly, and it rebounded again. The domestic market was still hardening. Although it rose, there were still many sellers, and people's hearts were quite uncertain. When the silver balancing tax was announced, it rose by 2.5%, calculated as 7% of the tax. After calculating the British exchange rate at 1 shilling 5 and 78125 pence, people's hearts gradually revived, sellers were disappointed. The market situation was relatively stable after entry, gradually rising. However, there was still a supply of goods at high prices. The banks pulled back and sold again. After that, it fell back once. Finally, the trading in the market turned flat. People's hearts remained stable. Demand exceeded supply. Although the market situation was extremely mediocre, the afternoon closing showed a clear trend towards stability. The after-market over-the-counter market was frustrated due to more sellers, but it still rose after the opening. The banks took advantage of the high price to sell US dollars, and it stabilized again. At this time, the banks reversed and pulled back shillings. The overall trend was extremely sluggish. Helplessly, large holders of spot goods continued to sell bars. Mr. Luo also had supplies. Floating shorts could not support it, and the price fluctuated. However, the banks had a strong appetite for US exchange rates, and they could still pull it up after it fell low. Although there were supplies after that, the situation was very stable because Mumbai telegraphed a drop of 2 annas, and Sassoon also pulled back shillings. It gradually pulled up, but large holders still came to sell off, and the price fluctuated again. However, it soon returned to calm. Mumbai telegraphed for the second time not to move, and a sluggish situation appeared. However, the closing trend was stable again. The situation was uncertain all day. Although there were many sellers, the buyers resisted stubbornly because the balancing tax increased by 2.5%. Now, the market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 985.2 yuan, 1.5 yuan lower than the previous closing. Hengyu and Richang took the lead, rising to 6.3 yuan, while Yuanchang, Yongding, and Tailai sold, retreating to 4.8 yuan. Fuxing, Dade, Xianfu, Yuyu, Hengyu, and others bought bars on the dip, rising to 6.4 yuan again. Huabi offered US dollars for April at 33.25 yuan. The domestic market was still hardening. It was heard that Taiyuan, Yida, Dalian Gang, Hengyu, and others were competing to sell, falling to 3.5 yuan. Yuqing, Yongda, Decheng, Huixiang, and others bought on the dip, rising to over 5 yuan. Huabi offered US dollars for January at 34 yuan. Wanxing and Yuqing Yong suddenly sold, and there was still a struggle. Afterwards, Decheng, Hengxing, Yuankang, Fuxing, Yongshen, Changyong, Zhaofeng, Chang, and Huixiang repeatedly bought bars, gradually rising to over 6 yuan. At this time, Dingtai and Fuyu successively sold off, and there were many setbacks. When the silver balancing tax was announced, it rose by 2.5%, with a 7% tax, people's hearts revived. Zhaofeng, Chang, Ruikang, Zhengchang, Qianchang, and Xiang came to buy, sellers were disappointed, and it gradually rose to 8 yuan. The exchange rate hardened and there were many shorts in the middle. Jiaotong once pulled back US dollars for January at 34 yuan, and the situation stabilized. However, sellers were still willing to be active at high prices. HSBC offered US dollars for February at 6875. After Dalian Gang, Yuanchang, Yongda, Fada, Yong, and Zhaofeng Chang sold off, it retreated to 6.2 yuan. Hengxing, Yicheng, and Hengyu bought on the dip. Trading in the market was slightly quiet, making it easy to raise the price. It then rose to 8 yuan. Qianchang Xiang sold off, and it immediately fell to 7.1 yuan. The afternoon closing was 987.5 yuan, which was relatively stable after the closing.</p>
<p>The opening of the after-market was 986.7 yuan, because the Dalian Gang and others immediately supplied goods over-the-counter. It then retreated to 6.4 yuan. Yongfeng Chang Sheng Yong bought bars, rising to 7.8 yuan. Citibank offered US dollars for January at 9375. Qianchang Xiang sold bars, retreating to 7 yuan. At this time, it was still stable because Huabi pulled back shillings for March at 1875. Before long, Fuchang, Yuanchang, Yongqian Changxiang, Hengyu, Ruikang, Decheng, Futai, Hengshun, Maoyuan, Yihongxing and others sold off together, and people's hearts were unsustainable, gradually retreating to 4.1 yuan. However, the exchange rate was still flat. Zhejiang still wanted US dollars for January at 34 yuan. Mitsui also bought US dollars for March at 33.4375 yuan. Tianfeng, Fuyu, and Changda rose to 5.8 yuan. Although Qianchang Xiang and Chunyuan Yong sold to 4.7 yuan, Mumbai initially reported a drop of 2.2.2 annas, and the situation was very stable. Then, because Dafa Yong and Fuxing Yong Fu'an came to buy, it rose to 6.1 yuan. Yuanmaoyong tried hard to supply bars, and it fell to 4.5 yuan. Mumbai reported for the second time not to move. At this time, it hovered around 5 yuan. Futaiheng had some supplies. Finally, Hengyu, Dayuan, Fuxing Yong, and others competed to buy, and the closing rose to 986.1 yuan. After the closing, although Dachang Xiang sold, it continued to rise because Dalian Gang, Tongfu, and Hengyu all bought. It was found that the highest price of the day was 988 yuan, and the lowest price was 983.5 yuan, with a fluctuation of 4.5 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly by 6 jiao compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The closing price was announced by the Central Bank's Standard Gold Bar price, retreating to 1012.3 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 26 yuan below par, 2 yuan weaker than the previous closing. The bars for this month have been cleared. The on-book price for January is 988 yuan. The water supplement in the morning was 979 yuan, and the water supplement in the afternoon was 977 yuan. The price of pure gold is about 1 yuan less than the standard gold bar price. The spot market situation is even more idle. The bars for December have been completely cleared. There are even fewer transactions in the market. Tianjin goods are still 3 yuan more than the standard gold bar price, and the trend is sluggish.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was mediocre. In summary, Decheng, Yuqing Yong, Shenkang, Renfa Yong, Fuyu, Dachang Xiang, Yongli, Fu'an Chang, Sheng Yong Yongfeng, etc. were on the buying side. Hongxing, Yuan Yi, Tongtai, Chang Yi, Yu Qianchang Xiang, Yuanchang Yong, Fuchang, Ruixing Yong, Detong Chunyifeng, Yongding Kang, Yuanmaoyong, Futaiheng, etc. were on the selling side. Hongkang Yong Huixiang Yicheng advanced and exited later. Dafa Yongding Tailai exited first and entered later. The Dalian Gang had few transactions. In summary, Wanxing made more than 700 bars in total, clearing about 100. Shunli made more than 400 bars in total, clearing evenly. Guangbang Shenghua Hengxing had little in and out. On that day, the major short holder Qianchang Xiang suddenly increased by more than 3,000 to 6,600 and some odd bars, while Yuan Yi reduced to more than 700 bars. The January futures chips totaled 29,723 bars, with a total of 62 bull companies and 55 bear companies. The total number of transactions on that day was 31,409 bars in the morning market and only 17,038 bars in the afternoon market.</p>

<h3>Securities, Tight Money Market, Difficult to Acquire Goods, Government Bonds Have Similar Short and Long-Term Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, loan interest rates eased slightly by two points, and the market remained flat and unremarkable. Only the initial opening showed a slight improvement, after which it remained in a state of hovering and stagnation. Both sides held their positions firmly. However, in recent days, long-term market prices have been higher, and sometimes the short and long-term market prices have been equal. The bulls are willing to pay out all the principal and interest, indicating that long-term bullish positions are extremely active. Although short-term prices are cheaper, they are unwilling to try. This suggests two reasons: first, many of those who take long positions are floating and unsubstantial; second, loan interest rates are high, the money market is tight, and it is difficult to acquire goods. Based on this situation, if the future environment and news change slightly, it will be easier to move downwards than upwards. Therefore, starting next week, there will be changes. Yesterday's trading saw the opening rise due to the easing of loan interest rates, and retail investors continued to buy, leading to a firm and upward market. An increase of six jiao and four fen was the most optimal. The second session became chaotic, with most prices rising more than falling, returning to a state of hovering. The afternoon opening was flat and weak, falling back by one or two jiao. The closing still showed highs and lows, varying and inconsistent, with minimal fluctuations. In total, the results for the day showed a slight increase of about five fen and one jiao to three jiao. The total number of transactions was 8,190,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Bulls Closing Positions</h3>

<h3>Yarn, Flower, Short Side Slightly Cautious, Standard Yarn Trading Gradually Decreases</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the afternoon after falling in the morning, and the situation was relatively calm. Because Tongcheng Company and general bulls had a very strong bullish view, the amount absorbed was quite large, and the pulling force was getting stronger day by day. However, spot yarn sales have gradually cooled down. The sellers are wary of the actions of the bulls and are afraid to short sell rashly. Therefore, the standard yarn business has gradually decreased.</p>
<p>(Golden Rooster Fell in the Morning and Rebounded in the Afternoon) The standard yarn market opened in the morning, and the popularity was slightly weak due to the decline in foreign cotton. There were slightly more sellers in the market, and each month fell by five, four, five, and six jiao. However, there were very few transactions. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn transactions had increased, and the cotton market rebounded, offsetting some shorts. The situation turned firm, and each month rose by one, three, four, five, and six jiao. The total number of transactions for the day was 10,650 bales. It was found that Tongji sold 500 bales, Daji sold 600 bales, Shenji sold 200 bales, Changfeng sold 1,500 bales, Xiecheng sold 350 bales, Tonghe sold 600 bales, Deji sold 250 bales, Shenchang sold 200 bales, and Shenyu sold 200 bales. Gengfeng bought 200 bales, Mingde bought 250 bales, Junchang bought 200 bales, Changyu bought 250 bales, Renfeng bought 450 bales, Dafu bought 300 bales, Jinchang bought 750 bales, and Runkang bought 600 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>| Standard Yarn | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|-------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------|-----------|</p>
<p>| December    | 184.0         | 183.5        | 184.0         | —      | 36,700    |</p>

<p>(Spot Sales Slightly Increased Compared to Before) Spot yarn sales were good, more than before. It was found that various groups bought a total of 1,196 bales for the day, and the market was slightly weak. The purchase amounts for each group are listed below:</p>

<h3>Sparse Source, Cotton Wants to Fall But Stops</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose, but the attitude of the general buyers was very firm. Because the sources from all over the country were withering, and the cotton reserves in Shanghai were scarce, the amount pulled in was firmly held and not released. However, spot cotton consumption was quite light, and various factories purchased very little. However, the larger sources will definitely sell when prices rise.</p>
<p>(Zheng Standard Rose and Fell by Five Points) The standard cotton market opened in the morning, and the market atmosphere was loose and falling. Because of the majority of the previous day's psychology, it was expected that the US and Indian cotton markets would continue to rise. It was unexpected that the telegraphs turned to fall, causing the bulls to be greatly disappointed. There was a lack of buyers in the market, but new sellers were also scarce. As a result, each month fell by one jiao and a half to two jiao and a half. The afternoon opening suddenly turned tight, and there were rumors on the market that a portion of Indian cotton was being transferred by foreign firms. As a result, the buying trend suddenly rose, and each month rose by one, two, and three jiao. The total number of transactions for the day was 53,900 dans. It was found that Jifeng sold 1,900 dans, Dafeng sold 2,200 dans, Yuanda sold 2,000 dans, Changyu sold 1,200 dans, Renfeng sold 1,000 dans, Yikang sold 1,800 dans, Yuanxingchang sold 1,100 dans, Yuanda sold 3,600 dans, Tongxing sold 1,700 dans, and Changhe sold 2,700 dans. Junchang bought 1,000 dans, Changfeng bought 5,500 dans, Shengyuan bought 1,400 dans, Hengyi bought 1,100 dans, Yicheng bought 1,400 dans, and Yongchang bought 1,100 dans.

<p>(Spot Cotton Factory Needs to Stop) Spot cotton consumption remains mediocre, and factory needs are sluggish. Because after the price is high, manufacturers' buying appetite is increasingly weak. However, those holding goods say that the arrival of goods from all sides is not smooth, and the spot price is still high. Sources say that Yao cotton is 100 bales and Tong cotton is 460 bales.</p>
<p>Hankou fine velvet 46.25-47.25, 285 pieces of Shenxin entered spot and sent to the factory</p>
<h3>US Cotton Retreated Due to Southern Hedging Sales</h3>
<p>Government-Pledged Cotton 150,000 Bales Released</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was weak due to southern hedging sales, sales in New Orleans, and a decrease in buyers. Spot prices fell by ten points, and futures fell by seven to twelve points. According to news, the Pennick case has a tendency to continue. Farmers' production must not exceed two extra bales. The news of US cotton's easy trade with Germany is contradictory and has an impact on the market. It is heard that the government urgently wants to release 300,000 bales of pledged cotton, half of which have already been released. British cotton futures and spot prices are unchanged. Indian cotton initially fell due to Japanese merchants' sales, but then rebounded due to brokers and European exporters' purchases. Plain Gool fell by two and a half annas, Omura fell by two rupees, and Bai Luoxi fell by seven and a half jiao. The original telegram is recorded on the left (6th telegram):</p>

<h3>Shanghai Hua-Ri Yarn Export Volume Increased in Late November</h3>
<p>According to a survey by a certain foreign firm in this port, the total sales volume of Hua-Ri yarn in late November amounted to 20,638 bales, including 6,125 bales of Japanese yarn and 14,513 bales of Chinese yarn. Compared with the shipment sales volume in mid-November, Japanese yarn increased by 369 bales, and Chinese yarn increased by 3,754 bales. The reason for the decrease in sales of Japanese yarn is said to be due to the sluggishness of Grade 3 yarn and the difficulty in exporting overseas. The increase in sales of Chinese yarn in Sichuan is due to the low exchange rate and active procurement. The destinations and quantities of Chinese and Japanese yarn are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Although the Grain Factories Have Re-Set the Price of Australian Wheat Standard Flour, the Selling Trend Is Not Significant</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a generally flat and weak trend across all months after the opening bell in the morning. The quoted price for foreign wheat saw Chicago down slightly by 2.5 cents, while Canadian wheat fell by about 30 to 40 cents. Consequently, the market sentiment for all months was flat and weak after the price opening. The current month's opening price fell by 1 cent, and forward months fell by more than 1 cent. Transactions by foreign firms remained stagnant, while trading by non-industry speculators remained active. Factories have started releasing small amounts of flour, so while the situation has reversed, the decline has not been significant. By the afternoon opening, the market for the current month had not stabilized, and forward months continued to decline. It was rumored that the factories had continued to set the price for two more ships of Australian wheat at 4.73 yuan per unit. However, there was a wait-and-see attitude towards selling on the market, so even with this news, the market was not significantly affected. As a result, the current month fell by 2 cents, January fell by 1.75 cents, February fell by 1.75 cents, March fell by 2.25 cents, April fell by 2 cents, and May fell by 2.5 cents.</p>
<h3>The Wheat Market Is Virtually Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening bell in the morning and afternoon, the wheat futures market was generally flat and weak, hovering around the same levels. The quoted price for foreign wheat fell by varying amounts of about 20 to 40 cents. Market sentiment naturally decreased. The key issue at present is that because the Lunar New Year settlement is approaching, trading has virtually stopped, and the funds for domestic wheat have already been allocated. Future developments must rely on the import of foreign wheat. Trading was quiet in both morning and afternoon sessions, and prices were slightly weak. As a result, the current month fell by 3 cents, February fell by 2 cents, and the rest remained unchanged. The spot wheat market remains stable, with high-quality wheat being quoted 10 to 20 cents higher, while medium- and lower-quality wheat remained unchanged. The opening prices were: Guigui wheat at 3.98 yuan, Xuzhou wheat at 3.97 yuan, Haizhou wheat at 3.92 yuan, Hankou wheat at 3.73 yuan, and Mingguang wheat at 3.94 yuan. 40 bales were shipped from Xinqu, 1,000 bales from Fufeng, and 1,000 bales from Shenda.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat: Long positions were taking profits, and short positions were covering, so there were no major changes. It is rumored that a large quantity of low-quality Canadian wheat will be imported for use as feed. Wang Shushu [corn] had a sharp sell-off, so caution seems advisable at current prices. Chicago wheat closing prices: Dec 5th/Dec 6th/Change: December 102.75/102.00/Down 0.75, May 104.00/103.375/Down 0.625, July 97.25/97.23/No change.</p>
<p>Spot Market: No Market, No Market. Canadian wheat prices: Dec 5th/Dec 6th/Change: December 80.625/79.10/Down 1.125, May 94.75/84.50/Down 1.25, July 86.25/85.00/Down 1.2. Spot price: 81.125/80.00/Down 1.125.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Thick Japonica Continues to Rise by a Few Cents</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) There were over 30 sources from various gangs (totaling about 60 shi [approximately 6,000 liters] of goods). There was considerable activity in this street, and the situation was tight. Prices for all goods increased again. Although there was only one load of about 100 bales by the Qingdao gang, the price of late rice suddenly continued to rise by a few cents, and various types of thick japonica rice increased by a few cents or more. Du Yang pointed rice continued to be sluggish due to the impact of foreign rice.</p>
<p>Yin Bian Yuan [unspecified type of rice] supply and demand were similar, so there was no significant price change.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about 20 ships arrived from various gangs at the river wharf. The river inventory is gradually decreasing, with about 130-140 ships. In terms of market sales, White Geng [japonica] rice sales were still active in the morning market, and the steamer-transported bales were slightly moving. However, the market was stagnant in the afternoon. Various types of Jianzao and thin rice were flat. Xin [new] Yuan [rice] and Yuan [rice] in small quantities were available, but liquor merchants showed no interest. The market for White Geng [rice] was tight in the morning market, increasing by several points, but turned weak in the afternoon. Yang Jian [rice] was slightly tighter. Prices for early rice, thin rice, Ke Jian [rice], Du Jian [rice], new and old Bai Yuan [rice], and Yin Yuan [rice] were stable.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian [Indica] Rice Prices Are Reported to Be Rising at the Production Areas</h3>
<p>The Spot Price of Foreign Rice Followed Up by 10 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for Ke Xian [indica] rice was extremely tight because there were telegrams from Changsha, Hankou, and Shashi reporting price increases, with production prices rising by more than 15 cents. Therefore, the selling price here was uniformly raised by 20 cents. However, due to the influence of foreign wheat, the increase was only 10 to 15 cents. Ke Xian [rice] sales were very active, and the interior regions were even more eager to purchase. There were inquiries from this street, Chongsha, Ningshao. Throughout the day, 7,816 bales of Hunan rice, 248 bales of Wuhu Yuan [rice], 3,972 bales of Hanzhou and Shashi rice were sold. The spot price of foreign rice also followed up by 10 cents, with more than 2,000 bales sold. 2,000 tons of futures were traded, mostly extracted by foreign firms, and the price also followed up by several points.</p>
<h3>The Soybean Market Sentiment Is Gradually Easing</h3>
<p>The soybean market situation in the past two days has seen a large number of shipments arriving due to the exemption of taxes and levies in Anhui Province, causing market sentiment to decline. However, according to industry insiders, most of these soybeans belong to Wuxi and Changzhou merchants, and at most only one-third are shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, the atmosphere in yesterday's market gradually eased. However, general attention is still bearish on soybeans from the Jinpu and Longhai railways, so trading is scarce. Aside from that, Hankou Zhazao soybeans saw a tightening of 20 to 30 cents. The reason is that the small grinders in the interior and this street are not weak, and the production area price is rising, so the supply is not abundant. It is estimated that over 700 bales of Hankou Zhazao soybeans were traded, with prices ranging from 3.27 yuan to 2.2 yuan. Also, 300 bales of late Dou were traded, with prices ranging from 3.19 yuan to 1.5 yuan. 69 bales of Jiujiang late Dou were traded, with prices at 3.4 yuan. Also, 150 bales of Pixian new Dou were traded, with prices opening at 3.2 yuan. Four vehicles of Dalian soybeans were traded, with prices ranging from 4.28 yuan to 4 yuan, with destinations being the interior and this street.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The Silk Market Continues to See Telegraphic Transfers</h3>
<p>(British Inventory of Chinese Silk Increases Sharply) The British inventory of Chinese silk has increased sharply. The current inventory of yellow and white silk from Sichuan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, and other provinces, as well as Cantonese silk, totals 4,825 bales, an increase of 1,428 bales compared to the end of the previous month (October).</p>
<p>(Shipping of Jili Dried Silk to Shanghai Is Not Weak) Sales of Jili dried silk to the United States have recently slightly increased, and the supply is not weak. This week, a total of 314 pieces of high-quality and medium-quality white dried silk from Xun (Nanxun) and Zhen (Zhenze) ports were shipped to Shanghai and are awaiting sale.</p>
<p>(Overseas Silk Sales Are Still Not Quiet) In the overseas market, Chinese silk has seen some interest as Japanese silk continues to rise. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai port continued to see telegraphic transfers, with Jardine Matheson and others importing 60 bales of Shanghai white factory silk and 60 bales of white dried silk. Prices are all trending upwards.</p>
<h3>Ping Shui Pearl Tea Sales to France Are Slightly Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the tea market of foreign firms in this port, Ping Shui pearl tea from Zhejiang Province saw slightly active sales to French firms. The whole market saw Tongfu, Yongxing, Yingfa, and other firms purchasing over 290 boxes of Ma Pearl tea, with selling prices ranging from 53 to 58 yuan, down 4-5 yuan compared to previous levels. In addition, Jardine Matheson, a British firm, purchased over 300 boxes of Zhen Mei green tea from Wuyuan North Road. Other items such as Gong Xi and Xiu Mei needle tea saw no transactions, and the situation remained sluggish.</p>
<h3>Only Over 700 Packages of New Chaoqing [Type of Sugar] Arrived in the Sugar Market</h3>
<p>The sugar market saw a slightly weak trend yesterday. The association set the price of Grade 24 raw sugar and ordinary white spot sugar at 18.53 yuan, and goods at the local warehouse at 18.63 yuan, with slight transactions, down 2 cents compared to the previous day. Re-export goods were offered at 5.2 yuan but no transactions were made. Grade 8-9 ordinary sugar was offered at 14 yuan with no spot goods. Re-export goods of KO brand were offered at 4.95 yuan, KNG brand at 4.8 yuan. Taikoo Sugar B grade was offered at 19.6 yuan, with few transactions. Mian Bai, Zhenji, and Zhenyu Grade 1 from the local factory were all offered at 17 yuan, with small sales and the market was firm. Only seven hundred packages arrived total yesterday for New Chaoqing [sugar] from Shandong Xiesheng's two rounds of imports. Samples can be opened and traded today, and it is predicted that there might be a slight increase. Blue goods [unspecified] were scarce, with demand exceeding supply.</p>
<h3>The Price of Southern and Northern Goods - Quanzhou Po Yuan [Dried Longan] Increases by 3-4 Yuan</h3>
<p>A total of 1,874 boxes of Quanzhou Po Yuan [dried longan] arrived from Fu Dong yesterday. According to letters from cargo merchants, inventory in the production area is already low, and most of it is in the hands of roasting households who are unwilling to sell cheaply and are quite speculative. Therefore, the market price for the goods purchased by various cargo handlers has actually increased by 3-4 yuan, with the main focus being on a sharp increase rather than sales. However, since Shanghai's sales are currently in the stage of clearing inventory, with a shortage of medium- and lower-grade goods, it is possible that there will be a further increase, while it will not be easy to increase prices for the higher-grade goods.</p>
<h3>Hardware: White Lead Sheet is Extremely Quiet and Poised to Move</h3>
<p>After white lead sheet briefly became highly sought-after last autumn, it has been in a state of continuous decline ever since. Although various businesses are trying their best to sell the product due to the critical nature of their investments, they ultimately become exhausted due to the dangerous environment. However, in recent days, the market has been extremely quiet and poised to move. Tea merchants have already started purchasing, and battery factories are also buying to replenish stock due to the high demand during the winter season. Therefore, transactions have been quite considerable. In terms of prices, only Grade 2 and Grade 5 have increased by 25 cents each, with Grade 2 selling for 27.75 yuan and Grade 5 selling for 26.5 yuan. Other grades remain unchanged. It is reported that over 40 barrels were sold yesterday.</p>

<h3>The Terror of New Weapons</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Currently, all nations are anticipating the arrival of the "Future War." Indeed, the occurrence of each war seems inevitable. In this upcoming war, the "survival of the fittest" is naturally expected. However, what about the "fit"? They are unwilling to be easily devoured. Therefore, we must prepare our military force and fight to the death.</p>
<p>Speaking of military force, it doesn't seem to be a simple matter. The primary condition for military force is weaponry. Broadswords and spears are too old and impractical. Long guns can inflict fatal wounds. Alas, even long guns and machine guns are somewhat outdated. The needs of the times have surpassed their capabilities, and they are gradually being discarded.</p>
<p>"Create new weapons!" This slogan permeates the entire world.</p>
<p>The so-called new weapons must naturally devour all the past clumsy methods using the latest techniques. Thus, the "death ray" has been tested and succeeded. It is said that this "ray," when it touches a person, can numb their senses, like being drunk. Without any military force, people will obediently let you manipulate them.</p>
<p>However, even the "death ray" is insufficient because inventors have the obligation to "maintain secrecy." So, if a war truly breaks out, you send a ray at me, and I have nothing to reciprocate. It seems somewhat "unpleasant," unable to reenact the sky battles depicted in our "Investiture of the Gods" tales, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, times are changing. What is considered regrettable may show you some color after undergoing a certain process.</p>
<p>Perhaps coincidentally, I found this news item when I opened the evening paper!</p>
<p>"...Following the 'death ray,' there is now a 'death sound' as a new weapon. Death sound is a special sound wave that causes death. Scientists have studied its structural principles, stating that it is highly possible. Its principle is roughly based on the number of vibrations per second of sounds heard by ordinary humans. Above or below this number are sounds that humans cannot hear. Now, its vibration frequency is increased, turning it into an extremely high-short wave, an inaudible sound wave. Its power can cause those who hear it to go insane, and in severe cases, cause death..."</p>
<p>In the above research, it seems like a novel toy. However, when these different, new toys begin to unleash their power, the destruction and demise of humanity become possible.</p>
<p>Standing on the eve of great terror, before the devouring of new weapons, will the weak be left to be eliminated by the strong?</p>

<p>Walking on the streets of the metropolis, the thin lined jacket and trousers he wore rustled loudly in the cold wind. He shivered, but didn't feel cold. "Looking at the countless stores with their big sale flags and colorful electric lights, he couldn't help but smile. Thinking about the small shops in his hometown town, with their red paper strips crookedly pasted on the yellowish glass, saying 'Special Clearance Sale', it was really annoying.</p>
<p>In the evening, the second uncle found a cousin who worked as a rickshaw puller in the city, and he took them to stay in an empty attic of a relative. Thus, they arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The next morning, the second uncle took A’Hu out to stroll around the streets (actually, to familiarize themselves with the roads). At a street corner, they heard a character reader shouting:</p>
<p>"Want to try it out? See if it's accurate on the spot!</p>
<p>Four copper coins, to ask about the ups and downs of the year, business fortune, and also to ask about finding business and switching business!"</p>
<p>"Finding business and switching business!" That touching advertisement struck the heart of this old "businessman" from the countryside with a bang, as if attracted by an irresistible force. He couldn't help but stop in front of the character reading stall and resolutely took out eight copper coins to ask about "business fortune" for himself and A’Hu.</p>
<p>The result was surprisingly joyful: both of them had great fortune in their years and smooth sailing in all their endeavors!</p>
<p>On the way back, the second uncle actually smiled. (According to A’Hu's memory, it was the first time he had seen the second uncle smile so happily since the Dragon Boat Festival.) He said repeatedly: "A’Hu, I said heaven never blocks all paths, Shanghai is good after all, we have smooth sailing," listen to that!"</p>
<p>He hid that "auspicious good omen" tightly in his heart like a treasure. On the afternoon of the third day, he went to find his cousin who was a rickshaw puller again: "Brother, you are familiar with Shanghai's market, please think of a way for me. Is there any 'road' to business?"</p>
<p>But the answer was more shocking than the character reader's "smooth sailing" to the second uncle. "Hey, you really take everything so easily! Does Shanghai have so many 'businesses' waiting for you? What can you do? Do labor? You don't seem to have the strength of an ox. Besides, people stronger than you are still begging for food in Shanghai. Do business? The huge stores are on sale and still no one comes to trade, 'everyone's closing down'."</p>
<p>But although the words were shocking enough to the second uncle, they didn't convince him. He didn't believe that such a good Shanghai didn't have his "road."</p>
<p>He himself was over sixty years old. He had been running a small shop in his hometown for at least ten years, right? But he had never seen such a year: "Hard" goods like matches, soap, and towels—daily necessities—no one wanted. In fact, no one even bought white rice in the rice shop! He, the second uncle, had experienced this himself and knew it very well.</p>
<p>After talking with his cousin for a day, he believed that the words "smooth sailing" were a bit unreliable: even A’Hu couldn't pull a rickshaw: pulling a rickshaw required a guarantor, which the second uncle had never even dreamed of.</p>
<p>And A’Hu, such a strong young man, was also stunned.</p>
<p>He wanted to set up a small stall on the street with A’Hu with the small goods he had brought out from the closed-down "Jing Guang Grocery" shop in his hometown, but it was said that it couldn't be done: he had to pay stall fees first. Thus, these few goods were useless. Watching the two yuan and more cash he had brought with him dwindle day by day, the second uncle was so anxious. Finally, he entrusted his cousin to sell some daily necessities cheaply to a Jinghuo store. When he got five yuan, his cousin said: "There's no road anywhere this year. Shanghai is a tiger's mouth, it's very scary. I advise you to go back to your hometown and suffer through the winter."</p>
<p>Standing there, he was at a loss, not hearing anything, only hearing one sentence: "There's no 'road' anywhere this year."</p>
<h3>The Wood-Chopping Old Man</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>"Hunchbacked old man, beard all loose, sees a good lady, eyes are just two slits." When he went out to chop wood every day, a group of wild children would chase after him and shout this, but he wasn't angry. He always turned around and smiled at them, saying: "Naughty little kids, I'll tell your mothers later to punish you."</p>
<p>He was very kind, and because he was kind, many children wanted to play with him. He was sixty-eight years old this year, but he was still very strong. He said himself: "Not to boast, four or five young men can't rattle me." But I have never seen him fight or get angry with anyone. People always greeted him with a smile.</p>
<p>I knew his surname was Xin, but there was no Xin in the Book of Family Names. As for his name, I didn't know it, but I heard people call him Old Man Changmao; that was probably his name. But I remembered that the soldiers during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were called Changmao, so his name might be a nickname! In our village, he had no seniority, and everyone, old and young, called him Old Man Changmao. He, on the other hand, called older women "sister-in-law," young ones "bride," unmarried ones "girl," and girls "little sister." He called men the same way, "brother," "younger brother," "little brother," "little kid." When he met someone wearing a long gown, he would call them "sir" or "young master."</p>
<p>He lived in a tomb estate house belonging to the Mi family, making a living by chopping wood all year round. In the two small plots of land beside the house, he planted two gardens full of lush green vegetables. He didn't observe any holidays or festivals, and when something happened in the village, he would take on the task of providing firewood, but he never haggled over the amount of the reward, so people always sent him some cakes, rice dumplings, vegetables, and other food to eat during the New Year and festivals. He also liked to drink, but not much. A hundred copper coins worth of raw grain liquor could last him at least two days, but he couldn't do without it. He also smoked a few pipes of dry tobacco, which were probably his only hobbies in life.</p>
<p>Speaking of his life, he got up every morning at daybreak, smoked a pipe of dry tobacco, put on his jacket, and patrolled the vegetable garden to see if anyone had come to steal vegetables. After returning, he made breakfast and went up the mountain to chop wood. He didn't come back for lunch because it took too much time to travel back and forth, so he always brought some steamed buns or sweet potatoes to satisfy his hunger, so that he could chop a few more bundles of firewood, and he would return when the sun went down. When he got back, he carried water to water the vegetables, and when everything was settled, he would stir-fry the cold rice until it was hot and eat it, and then lie in bed, still thinking about what he should do tomorrow.</p>
<p>One day, because it was raining, I was idle, so I went to find him to talk. When I got to his house, he was just making straw sandals. We talked for a long time, and he told me how fierce the Changmao during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were, how the refugees suffered, and how cruel the government soldiers were. He was still young at that time, and he escaped with his father. His mother was killed by the Changmao! He also said:</p>
<p>"My father escaped to this place and worked for others, and slept here with me at night. I still sleep here now. Because I like to tell stories about the Changmao, people call me Changmao. Actually, my real name is A’Mao."</p>
<h3>Winter Overcoat</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>The gray-black floating clouds, like old tattered cotton wadding, spread over the entire sky, freezing like ice, with not a trace of blue cracks visible. The sky was indeed so low that it seemed to cover people's heads.</p>
<p>The early winter cold wind, like a knife, roared straight down from the tops of the withered yellow trees, rustling as it swept down the fallen leaves. Along the sidewalks of the road, sparse pedestrians hurried back and forth, shrinking their necks as they were blown by the sand-laden cold wind. Although the drummers on the upper floors of the department stores were still desperately blowing and drumming, the front doors were deserted, with not a single customer in sight. Only the "Peach Blossom River" song transmitted from upstairs lulled the clerks into a somewhat sleepy state, tilting their heads and yawning. The streetlights standing by the roadside, emitting a dim yellow glow, weakly and lifelessly,</p>
<h3>Mutual Use</h3>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>In the winter twilight, they also seemed to feel the cold weather, constantly shivering.</p>
<p>"The weather is gradually getting colder, and it may snow soon. It's impossible to go without an overcoat." As He Lian turned into that quiet little road, he felt the severity of the cold wind especially keenly, his hands and feet freezing cold and numb. He muttered to himself privately.</p>
<p>Thus, He Lian thought of his winter overcoat stored in the pawnshop.</p>
<p>At the same time, he also recalled an incident he had encountered yesterday when he went to his friend's house for a banquet—an incident that, when he thought about it now, still made his thin, pale face suddenly flush with a red cloud. His heart was as uncomfortable as if many small insects were crawling and biting inside. At that time, he really didn't have the mood to enjoy the delicious dishes:</p>
<p>When He Lian stepped into his friend's house, the luxuriously furnished living room was already full of guests. Thus, his friend introduced him to everyone. When he shook hands with a young lady, he felt that the lady, upon touching his cold palm, shivered involuntarily, and goosebumps appeared on her face covered with rouge. This really made him so ashamed that he wished there was a hole he could immediately crawl into. His friend also seemed to realize something and said to him privately:</p>
<p>"Lian, haven't you felt cold these days? Why don't you wear your overcoat?"</p>
<p>Perhaps the sad living conditions of wanderers are not well known to certain gentlemen with inheritances, just as in the philosophy of wealthy people who live secluded lives, they don't believe that poor people are so impoverished that they don't even have food to eat. But who doesn't want face?</p>
<p>"Well, because I went out at noon, and the sunshine was very warm then..." Saying this, another guest arrived, and his friend was busy entertaining them, so He Lian finally left the rest of the sentence unfinished.</p>
<p>"The winter overcoat must be taken out." When He Lian stepped out of his friend's door, braved the biting cold wind, and got on a rickshaw back home, he had already decided on the way to send the two sets of summer clothes in his trunk to the pawnshop tomorrow, and then take out the winter overcoat.</p>
<h3>Mother and Wife</h3>
<p>— No</p>
<p>Mother - A sickly mother.</p>
<p>Wife - A newlywed wife.</p>
<p>He - The mother's son, the wife's husband, a young man in his early twenties who is not yet self-reliant.</p>
<p>His mother loves him, and his wife loves him too. He happily accepts these two different kinds of love.</p>
<p>He has both fish and bear's paw. But such a heavenly environment is, in fact, not allowed. The mother loves him, not his wife; the wife loves him, not his mother. If the mother and wife could both love the house and crow, then his happiness could be maintained.</p>
<p>But women are, after all, women - their love is intuitive, and they do not consider that the pain of their quarrels will be added to the person they love.</p>
<p>Before her illness, the mother was gentle. But years of sickness have tempered her temperament into irascibility.</p>
<p>As for the wife? She is loyal to her husband. As long as her reasons are correct, she will do her best to defend herself against the other party's attacks.</p>
<p>But the mother, whose irascibility has been forged by illness, constantly wants to fulfill what she considers her inherent authority as a mother-in-law. Therefore, she sees her wife's defense as resistance, as disobedience, and feels that she cannot back down without teaching her a lesson.</p>
<p>Thus, the bubble of happiness has burst.</p>
<p>Who is to blame? The wife, she is not wrong; the mother, she is the creator of her own situation!</p>
<p>The rope of pain tightly binds him. He has no strength to mediate and dare not protect either side.</p>
<p>Such an unfortunate crisis is brewing, brewing, and finally one day it erupts -</p>
<p>In a ward on the third floor of XX Hospital, a young woman who has taken poison and a panicked young man are brought in. The man anxiously asks the doctor who is performing the surgery:</p>
<p>- Can she be saved?</p>
<p>His pitiful gaze is like that of a criminal begging for mercy in court.</p>
<p>- Too late!</p>
<p>The doctor puts down the needle and replies without any expression.</p>
<p>Like a death sentence, he collapses on his wife's body, his hands tightly grasping her stiffening fingers, calling his wife's name in a heartbreaking manner as if summoning her soul:</p>
<p>- Lijing! Lijing! Lijing!</p>
<p>Tears fall drop by drop on the pale face of the woman he loves, the face of a wife lingering at the gate of life and death! He hopes that her tightly closed mouth will move and be able to say a few last words to him.</p>
<p>But everything has been decided by fate. His wife's eyelids only lift slightly once and she can no longer say anything.</p>
<p>Dazed, as if his soul has been taken away by his wife, an unusual shock pierces his heart. The shadow of his wife floats up as soon as he closes his eyes. He remembers when he left this morning, his wife very seriously said goodbye to him; but who would have thought? At such a young age (twenty years old), such a small incident (inevitable bickering between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law), to take that road with such determination.</p>
<p>Thinking of his wife's past kindnesses, thinking of his wife's current tragic death, he really wants to avenge her, even at the cost of his own life. But needless to say, it was the mother who caused the incident - a mother whose irascibility had been forged by illness! So this thought had to be forever buried in his heart.</p>
<p>Who is to blame? This chasm between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law!</p>
