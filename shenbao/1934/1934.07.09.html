<h3 id="c16">法國外交政策與巴爾都東歐之遊 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 逸</p>
<p>爲凡爾賽體系主人翁之法國。對於歐洲大陸向有居高臨下操縱自如之勢。惟自希特勒崛起以來。感受「褐色危險。」卽慮及凡爾賽體系或將動搖。加以半年來。意國與奥匈關係日趨密切。以致法國經營日久之多腦河計畫。無從實現。近又親見希特勒與墨索里尼會談於威尼斯。益恐凡爾賽體系在兩個敵人携手之前受打擊。</p>
<p>另一方面。與歐洲大陸隔一衣帶水之英國。雖亦賴凡爾賽體系以生存。然不顧法國獨握覇權。則十五年如一日。故常採用扶德抑法政策。周旋於柏林與巴黎之間。以英國之有所偏袒。益使法國陷入重圍。六月初間。英法代表在日内瓦軍縮委會上之舌戰。卽英法矛盾比前緊張之證明。由此觀之。似乎法郎外交之難關。十年以來。未有如今日之甚者。</p>
<p>天下事惟窮則變惟變則通法國自批准法蘇互不侵犯條約以後。不惟放棄其傳統之反蘇聯運動。並且進而與蘇聯敦睦邦交。藉此以維持歐洲大陸之新均勢。法郎外交之靈活。卽此已見一斑。因法蘇關係之改善。在法國領導下之衛星丨丨小恊約國與波蘭。亦先後與蘇聯修好。去年七月所謂含有侵略者界說之多邊公約。曾經小恊約國與波蘭簽字。本年六月。羅馬尼亞與捷克亦同時與蘇聯恢復國交顯然是法國外交政策轉變後之新收穫。得到此種新收穫。法國在歐洲大陸上所受之威脅自然减輕。</p>
<p>但從另一視角觀察。似乎法國領導下之衛星。亦略露離心之傾向。如波蘭與德國接近卽其事實之一。故法國當前之外交政策。除拉攏蘇聯加入國際聯盟以壯聲援外。計惟有發揮其外交手腕。使各衛星更團結於凡爾賽體系之周圍。以與歐洲反凡爾賽體系之陣綫對抗。從前巴爾都訪問華沙與布拉格。卽前述外交政策之具體表現。最近巴爾都又於六月十八日重遊東歐。先往羅馬尼亞繼往南斯拉夫。於二十七日回到巴黎。溽暑遄征風塵僕無非欲憑三寸不爛之舌。加緊團結凡爾賽體系現有之勢力。以期突破法郎外交之難關也。</p>
<p>聞巴爾都車入羅馬尼亞國境。後到一城市。輙有居民盛服至站𤍠烈歡迎甚至參衆兩院。亦宣佈巴氏爲「羅馬尼亞名譽公民」。在南斯拉夫所受之歡迎。其𤍠烈不减於羅馬尼亞。吾人固不信如巴黎各報所稱。「法外長在二十四小時内征服羅馬尼亞。」然巴氏此行能使兩個衛星更與法國站到同一戰綫上。則右斷言也。本月六日巴黎衆議院外交委員會開會。巴氏卽席聲稱。法國外交主旨。本於「隨時隨地覓求和平」之原則何謂和平在巴氏心目中。不過爲維持凡爾賽體系下之均勢局面已。</p>
<p>假使法郎外交果眞百尺竿頭更進一步。則反凡爾賽體系之勢力自亦「水漲船高。」此次巴氏發表反對修改和條約之宣言所激起之匈牙利示威運動。不過其一例耳。鈎心鬥角之外交戰。或卽武裝衝突前夜所必採之手段歟。</p>

<p>（東京）岡田内閣因與政友會起糾紛、至今晨組織始完成、下屆國會難免與政友會起正面衝突、但政友會自身在此最近期間内、一定分裂、故其勢力並不可怕、據傳新内閣之施政方針、大略如左、</p>
<p>（一）澈底肅淸綱紀、革除中央及地方之黨弊、小原任法相·後藤轉任内相之目的在此、</p>
<p>（二）擴大陸海軍備、準備二次大戰、此内閣之性質、與日俄戰前之首次桂内閣彷佛相似、桂内閣以前、均爲元老輪流組閣、故稱桂内閣爲三流内閣、小村當外交、陸海之中堅寺内山本各任、陸海軍大臣、岡田閣之外相廣田爲小村外交之繼承者、大角及林又爲軍部中心人物、故目的在備戰（三）整理財政及行政、改爲戰時編制、</p>

<p>（六）實行强硬政策、以不辭一戰之决心、進行萬邦恊和外交（八日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）貴院方面以岡田内閣無視貴院、與政黨官僚結合、組標榜綱紀肅正、然其人選中是否能滿足此點、殊爲疑問、故評判不佳、惟期望後藤農相謀選舉之公平、但又有中途而止之危險、綜合此等事情觀之、岡田内閣恐意外短命云、（八日專電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）廣田外相於八日初次會議散會後、關於外交政策、語其抱負如左、</p>
<p>余曾於五省會議所决定之恊和外交方針仍擬盡力蹈襲、决不變更宗旨、現今内外均處於嚴重之時局、余竟留任於外相原職、責任重大、自不待言、至於日美關係曾於赫爾廣田行使換文之際、大致已獲諒解、是以日美親善關係、已非言論時期、早經進至實際境地矣、擬候齋藤大使（駐美日使）歸國、聽取此中詳細情形、然後加以考究也、至中日關係、現已漸次轉佳、已屬事實上之證明、故對華政策、仍須依照從來之方針也、日蘇關係之最近問題、不久可望解决、唯滿洲問題、乃日本當前最關重要之問題、因此國民須竭全力以傾注之、方能有所進展、日本爲完成滿洲問題計、無論人力財力、均須以其重要部分而担當之、並宜以此項覺悟而策進行也、現今世界在政治經濟上均陷於恐慌狀態之中、倘欲克服此項現象、非列强共同努力不可、若大國能於此時感其維護和平之責任、從其互相諒解、則世界之大亂苗自可滅絶、明年之海軍會議、可謂達到此目的之最大時機矣云云、（八日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）廣田外相之留任、係以前内閣當時五相會議所决定之國防外交方針、繼續維持爲條件、今因更具體化計、向岡田首相提議、從速召開岡田·廣田·林·大角·藤井等之五相會議、在該會議以一般國防外交方針及軍縮會議根本對策爲議題、進行恊議、（八日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）林陸相之談話如下、外傳余留任之條件、係承認陸軍之國防國策、但實無傳說之甚、余曾向首相充分披瀝所　、並成立相當諒解、則係事實云、（八日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）陸軍對新内閣之觀測、以爲照目下之情勢、成立若斯程度之内閣、以便適當、並希望岡田新内閣根據政策本位邁進、又關於陸軍之重要國策、岡田首相亦承認、故對其實現、有相當確信、且今後决向岡田首相充分要求、卽國防政策係充實軍備、解决對滿政策等、尤其對後者、欲以關東廳爲地方廳、根據從來之三位一體、改爲二位一體、於全權大使之管轄下、新設監督滿鐵及在滿諸公司之機關、並擬就計畫廢除該障礙之拓務省、又林陸相於久留任之際、對於此類政策之實施、曾獲得岡田首相之同意、故其前提於此次組閣之際、以首相兼攝拓相也、（八日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）今日藤井藏相關於今後之財政經濟政策、曾陳述懷抱、茲綜合其大要如下、</p>
<p>（一）財政經濟政策原則上、踏襲高橋前藏相之政策、（一）理財係謀减少公債·節約歲出等、以圖歲計之均衡、惟現在之内外局勢、於國防費及其他、需相當設施、故今後恐難急遽圖財政之確立、（一）因此若增稅等、乃痛感必要、但實行之時期及方法、須縝密研究、卽對國防外交財政三者之調和、擬與前内閣當時之方針全同進行、（八日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）拓務省之廢止說、日來極盛、岡田新首相一再否認、然竟不另薦適當人物担任拓務大臣、岡田自身兼攝、但政界料將來必行廢止、其原因如下、（一）軍部主廢止、認爲拓務省雖稱管轄台灣·朝鮮·樺太·關東州·南洋委治島、然此等地方均可由内務省管轄、故廢止一省以節省行政制、（二）拓務省從來所管理之移民事項、除南美一部分外、此後之移民政策、最注重滿洲、故移民事業須當由軍部主持、（三）關東州及滿鐵公司、現雖由拓務省主管、但此事將來必須關東軍司令官主管、（八日華聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）拓相一席由首相兼任者、因對滿政策之關係、遭軍部外務之反對、一時兼任、將於適當時期廢止拓務省、但另一方面謂軍部與岡由首相之間、並無廢止拓務省之諒解、係欲起用目下由美歸國之近衛文磨公爲拓相之故、蓋係一時的便宜云、（八日電通社電）</p>

<p>浦東高橋區人力車夫、於昨晨爲與該地公共汽車爭奪營業事、致與公安局警士發生衝突、致使公共汽車未能行駛、斷絶交通者凡數小時、直至下午六時半、始恢復交通、茲將各情、分誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c142">出事原因 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>高橋自海濱浴塲開闢之後、人力車生意頗佳、旋本市公用局在該地設辦公共汽車、因取價低廉而快穏、致人力車業受相當影響、車夫對之、頗爲不滿、昨日因係星期日、加之本埠羣益公記科學社同時又在該地首次試騐水上平安帶、故游者倍於往昔、昨日上午十一時、自滬上外灘銅人碼頭開出之市輪渡達高橋、當時在高橋碼頭之人力車夫與公用局公共汽車爭奪營業起見、未守秩序、上前向主客兜攬生意、而使在該地之公共汽車、未能駛行、警士上前勸止、車夫不從、警等遂將悅來黃包車公司之車夫二人、被拘入公安局三區四分所拘押、</p>
<h3 id="c143">衝突情形 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>此事之後、人力車夫均抱兎死狐悲之感、頗爲憤激、於是糾集同伴數十人、趨往高橋之公共汽車站前、將所用人力車輛及獨輪小車、均推置於汽車站前、阻止汽車開行、蓋人力車夫、素來極恨汽車之妨碍彼等營業、故藉此使彼此雙方均不能接待游客、當時之阻碍事輛、約有五六十輛之多、時在十一時三刻、車輛交通、完全斷絶、游人因在高橋碼頭、距離海濱浴塲、頗爲遙遠、於烈日下往返跋涉、頗感勞頓、無不呌苦、</p>
<h3 id="c144">各受微傷 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>惟公共汽車、爲維持交通起見、與三區四分所接洽、由上級機關派水上公安局警士一小隊、駛抵車站、是時各人力車夫更抬置巨大之磚石數方、置於道中、阻塞汽車、警士驅之不散、拔出警根、實行驅逐、車夫等竟一擁上前、徒手摶擊、警士見衆寡懸殊、急出槍向天放空槍示威、結果雙方各有數人受傷、至十二時一刻、車夫等退去、一塲紛擾、暂吿平息、惟車夫則依舊率車堆置道中、公共汽車爲避免糾紛起見、仍暫時停止交通、惟當時突時、有車夫六七人、被拘入警署、</p>
<h3 id="c145">臨時解决 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>同時汽車公司復派員與人力車公會交涉、旋經地方人士出而和解、結果、人力車夫於下午六時自動取消、以碍行動、公共汽車乃於午後六時半、恢復通車、至被捕之車夫、卽可望釋出、故昨日往高橋之遊客、幾有不能返滬之慨、直至八時餘、始抵本埠、</p>

<h3 id="c179">相對眞理與絶對眞理　丨答田昭尹繼善諸君丨（續） <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>死的眞理，在我們看來似乎是再淺顯没有了的。但原始狩獵民族還會由於社會的實踐上的限制而得不到完全的觀念。那麽，其他更複雜更深刻的眞理當然更是有實踐上的限制了。相對眞理，是人们走向絶對眞理必然要經過的過程，每一種相對眞理只有絶對眞理的一部分，絶對眞理是多方面的，而相對眞理就是它的一方面。人類的認識就是從相對眞理的過程中漸漸地接近絶對眞理，所以認識也是一種運動，眞理在人類的頭腦中，並不是固定的，眞理中所反映的事物，是活動電影一樣地漸漸地展開了的，每一節影片都代表全部影戲的一部分，而全部的影片就由這許多的部分所構成。所以說，絶對眞理是相對眞理之總合，總計，或歸結。</p>
<p>這樣，我們可以知道，相對眞理與絶對眞理互相間是有着不可分的關係的。没有相對眞理，則絶對眞理就無從達到。没有絶對眞理，則相對眞理便没不結論。舊的哲學尤其是觀念論的哲學在主張絶對眞理時，便完全否認了相對眞理而以爲絶對眞理可以突然達到，以爲不必從實踐中，去一步一步地認識出來，但一脫離了實踐，就不能不用空想來代替現實的眞理，結果成爲武斷，成爲觀論念，這是錯誤的。至於主張相對眞理的人則又凡事只注意眼前的實證不相信眞理可以用來推論將來的事物，只注意眼前而不信任將來的結果，便會成爲懷疑主義，但事實上眞理是能預測將來的，科學上的一　眞理决不欺騙我們，主張只有相對眞理的人在事實上是　然了科學的價値，我們自然要反對的。</p>
<p>還要指出一點：相對眞理有發展而爲絶對眞理的可能性，是前面已說過的了。而絶對眞理的本身，也决不是完全固定不動的，我們所認識的事物一旦有所增加，即可以使所達到的絶對眞理更豐富，更具體，使之成爲更高的絶對眞理。宇宙事物是無限地各方面的，眞理的發達也是無限的，我們所達到的絶對眞理，與無限多樣的宇宙萬物比較起來，它仍是相對而不完全的東西，它只在我們實踐的一定的階級裏有絶對的完全的意義，實踐愈發展，則絶對眞理的内容也會愈豐富，而其眞理的價値也愈增高。</p>

<p>一、該省女子職業敎育機除省立詐墅關蠶業職業學校外、尙無其他單獨機關、亟應增設一二所、以擴充女子職業敎育之機會、</p>
<p>二、省立學校、多係高級程度、在地方初級職業學校、尙未能遍設以前、應斟酌情形、兼辦初級職業學校、以適應需要、</p>
<p>三、家事敎育各省市均少提倡、該省爲敎育發達區域、應力予提倡、設校實施、</p>
<p>四、私立商業職業學校、每多名不副實、旣無商業實習之設施、又無充分適當之商業陶冶、無異於普通中學、應設予取締、於可能時責令改辦商業職業補習班、兼收靑年店員學徒、以利實用、　　五、中學與職業單獨設置、各項職業科勿令其繼續附設於中學、以符規定、</p>
<p>六、對於私人辦理職業學校、應設法提倡並獎助其校有成績者之發展、惟對於商業職業學校之設置、應切實依據環境需要、予以相當限制、</p>
<p>七、應利用原有職業學校之人才設備盡量附設各種需要之職業補習學校、或補習班、</p>
<p>八、查職業學校體育、規定每日二十分鐘、就實習工作時間内行之、以求學生身心之調劑、各校均未遵辦、應予注意、</p>
<p>九、原有各種職業學校校名、應即依照規程訂正、以求劃　、</p>
<h3 id="c191">乙、關於各校者 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>、省立宜興農業學校已往設施、諸多妥、學生訓練及實習工作、尤嫌鬆懈、農林工具及參考圖籍、亦殊缺乏、亟應改善充實、</p>
<p>二、省立宜興陶業學校學生二十名、年費二萬元殊不經濟、學校擬添設高中班製造瓷磚、惟根據已往經騐招生不易、初中學生更不易招收、可改招高小學生、五年畢業、同時並可添設補習班招收廠家學徒、學校出品定價過高、銷售不易、關於陶工彫刻等科、每週只一二小時、似應酌加调色配花及辨别火花等方法技術、尤應使學生熟練明瞭、並應積極與本地各業户各作研究、改良瓷業、</p>
<p>三、省立宿遷玻璃科職業學校、該校辦理不久、成績尙佳、惟所製品大部分爲杯·碟·油燈·燈罩·與社會上原有出品競爭、應兼製理化生物上所需要之一切玻璃用具、以抵制一部分之外貨、所設班次、並不宜限於高級、對於製品、須注意耐𤍠性之研究、</p>
<p>四、省立淮陰農業學校、全校敎職員四十餘人、計專任敎員十七人、兼任敎員九人、職員十七人、校工二十人、據說困於環境及校舍散漫未能裁减、揆之班級與學生人數、均嫌太多、應設法縮减、農產品製造、尚須加意改善、</p>
<p>五、省立蘇州工業學校、圖書很缺乏、儀器多係陳舊、工廠實習第三年級僅占全時間四分之一、一二年級更少、染織成績欠佳、敎廳令學校今後注重生產、惟因缺乏資本、未能進行、應添招職工輔助學生生產同時實施職業補習敎育、</p>
<p>六、省立蘇州中學化工科及省立揚州中學土木科、兩學各附設高級職業科、成績均尙可觀、惟蘇州中學與省立工業學校毘鄰、化工科應併入工業學校辦理、以專責成、揚中土木科、亦應併入蘇州工業學校土木科、如認爲必要、亦可連同擬添辦之水利科單獨設校以符職業學校單獨設置之規定、</p>
<p>七、省立吳淞水產學校、該校設備本尙充實、受一二八滬戰影響、損失殆盡、嗣敎廳撥欵四萬元、其中三萬元修理校舍、一萬元補添機械、不及原有設備六分之一、敎學上殊感困難罐頭製造工廠因設備不全又無流動資本、無法生產、應速設法恢復舊觀、學生缺乏勤苦勞作習慣、亦應注意、</p>
<p>八、省立蘇州農業學校、園藝科除注重菒種改良外、應兼注意花卉及庭園設計、農藝科之農產製造尤須添置機械改善出品、</p>
<p>九、私立啟明錫光疏雪成志安定高初級商業職業學校、以上各校除啟明原擬辦理商業學校外、餘皆限於高初級中學之設立、不得已而改辦商業、實際上仍實施其中學敎育、細查其授課時間表、關於商業科目、不及全數七分之一、言其實習、則只有簡陋不堪之學校商店一所、打字機一二架、且學習時間甚少、無實際價値之可言、亟應設法取締、限制設立、</p>
<p>十、私立南通學院附設高級紡織科及中學、高級紡織科之設立、其動機在華商紡織廠聯合會之提議、培養中級技術人員並由會擔任每年經常費三萬元、曾付過半年經費迄未續付、經濟非常拮据、敎學精神亦差、成績尙無表現、擬添設之金工設備、如翻砂·模型·木工·鍜工等、均困於經濟、無法進行、亟應設法補助、農科附設之中學、環境上並無需要、應即改辦高級農藝及畜牧科、利用原有設備及人才、以資推廣、</p>
<p>十一、私立鎭江女子初級職業學校、蠶桑科職業科目、每週僅有九小時至十一小時、家事師範科職業科目、每週只四小時至六小時、普通科目、如國文·英文·算術·理化等、每多至五小時至九小時、諸多款未合、家事師範科、因缺乏設備、實習甚不充分、且目前一切設施、亦未能與設科原旨相符、應注重家事勞作科目、最好前三年完全注重家事園藝敎育、其有志願充當小學勞作敎員者、則延長一年專習心理敎育方法及敎材组織等學科、</p>
<p>十二、私立正則女子職業學校、該校高級繪畫科人數稀少、尙無成績可言、應加重應用美術功课、刺繡科可加添縫紉科目、三年畢業籘工學科宜删、普通師範應停業辦、或改辦家事勞作師範科、補習班尙發達、應設法擴充、</p>
<p>十三、鎭江縣立職業補習學校及南通縣立女子職業補習學校、前者設文書編刺電鍍三科、後者設縫紉刺繡二科、設科目的旣未確定、一切設備敎學、亦屬簡陋平常、無成績可言、文書科學生年齡幼稚、程度低、又設施尤爲不當、亟須充實改善、</p>
<p>十四、私立東南職業學校、該校設農商二科商科毫無設備、農塲只有五畝上學期因學校尙未立案、人數銳减、家長紛紛請求多設普通科目以便升學、學校爲適應環境計、遂將職業科目减少、現有科目之設置、紊亂無章、缺少一定標凖、少數校董、如學校有適當整理計劃、亦願捐助農田、極力資助、應設法恊助整理、</p>
<p>十五、私立光化初級簡易化工科職業學校、該校實習塲所狹小簡陋、所擬定之學習科目、過於繁瑣、多而不精、亟應充實改善、校長楊正宇、兼任上海某大學課務、不常在校、校務由敎導主任負責、殊有未合、</p>
<p>十六、私立正誼初級職業學校、該校原設商業家事二科、辦理欠善、暑假後、商業科擬改辦鹽務科、注重管理及製造、應改辦高級、並注意課程編制及敎員人選、以收實效、現有家事科課程内容、過於簡單、名不副實、校長曹芻、現任省立鎭法師範校長每週只至校一次、均屬不合、</p>

<p>因爲瑾妃祇是一個（妾媵）式的妃子，而隆裕雖爲皇后，却也不得太后之歡。個中的情節，眞是曲折得令人難解：照理說，太后旣因光緒太寵愛珍妃而深惡珍妃，那末伊總該歡喜隆裕了，何况隆裕還是伊老人家嫡親的内姪女呢，然而伊竟不愛隆裕！大家庭中原是最多氣鬧的，在宮中，所有的人尤其不能和睦，眞是怪事！</p>
<p>太后對於光緒旣是這樣的漠漠無情，那末爲什麽這一次奉天去偏要帶着他同走呢？這中間的緣故，我們這些人差不多全知道；就是光緒他自己，也何嘗不明白。總括的說一句，便是太后對於他還是不信任，惟恐他在脫離了伊的堅視之後，再有什麽不良的企圖：所以太后無論到什麽地方去，總是很不放心，非得把這一個特殊的政治犯帶着同走不可。也許伊也相信光緒此刻確已没有什麽野心了，但是伊還擔心那些朝臣中或者再會有六君子那樣的人，在伊離京的時候，乘機出而煽惑光緒，勸他利用外力，再把太后的政權奪去，這一慮當然是很有幾分可能的；而太后的性氣，偏又是特别的歡喜弄權。雖然伊已經貴爲太后，一切享用，無不遠出别人之上，可是伊並不滿足，伊覺得倘無實在的政權，在伊自己的手掌中把握着，所有的榮華富貴，便一齊等於零；因此伊不惜冒了絶大的的危險，不顧各方的誹謗，拚性捨命地緊握着伊的政權。我往往見伊爲着一件疑難的朝政，以致於終日寢食不安，便不禁暗暗的懷疑，究竟伊爲着什麽緣故而能長時期的樂此不疲呢？（七八）</p>

<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>說起來，這彷佛已近乎老話了。八歲那年上了學塾，每天歸來後，總是歡天喜地似的有（放學錢）可得。這數目，於今思之，眞小得很可笑的，只有制錢三文！然而把它一天一天地積起來串在一條繩上；久之，自能變成百文，就交給母親代藏着，我似乎已變成富翁了。</p>
<p>所謂點心，用不着自己挖腰包的。旁的小吃，現在已有些茫然了。粽子糖似乎是一文錢一隻吧。立方體的晝方豆腐乾，三文錢可買二塊。有時把一天的放學錢貼上了二文，便可買到一塊扁圓形的荷包豆腐乾大嚼，可是這已似覺過於奢侈了！</p>
<p>說起點心，二十四文一碗的大肉麵是難得上嘴的。（蟹殼黃）呢，每個三文。湯包十件，値錢三十文。湯糰每個亦是三文。於今思之，這又是很可笑的：湯糰向例是一客五個的，可是我的表弟因爲食量太小，所以他每上點心店的時候，總要提着一隻盛着空碗的籃子去，把那吃剩的肉饀或整個的湯糰帶回來。</p>
<p>那年母親半夜生產，鬧得我終夜未能安眠。翌晨東方發白，蒙伊憐惜，命我上店去吃碗鷄麵，費了四十二文。</p>
<p>（寫書法）是學塾裏的必修課。三文錢的一張竹紙可裁十六張。母親把它放在一隻空蜜糕盒子内，我日取一張，異常珍惜似的。</p>
<p>以上所述，固然不過是些兒時的憧憬。（我瞻四方，蹙蹙靡騁，）也只有這些憧憬，還時時勾上心來。</p>

<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>在這兒，没有輪船汽笛聲，没有市廛的煩囂聲，寂靜的空間，只有淙淙的水聲，和婦女的擣衣聲，此唱彼和的，奏出一種很有節制的闪響曲。</p>
<p>水碼頭的構造，從平斜的河岸上，砌着一層一層的磚級，婦女們行走其間，從高低的階級上跋來報往，坦率的情形，比跑着樓梯，還來得舒適，寫意。</p>
<p>内地小城市裏，不論村莊，鄕眞，旣没有自來水的設備，又没有鑿着許多自流井。因此婦女們取水擣衣，以及淘米洗菜，莫不視水碼頭爲唯一的好去處。</p>
<p>汲水桶，擣衣杵，以及筐兒，藍兒，在每個人手裏提着，以每日傍晚，中午，最爲𤍠鬧，一般婦女　集的時候，從水平綫上的波紋浪跡裏，每引起嬉笑嬌嗔，及張家長，李家短，種種不同的談話。有時因水點的濺潑，及位置的爭奪，也可以演出相駡的活劇來；伊們面部的表情，從水鄕澤國的邊際，盡情流露着，完全是一種天眞之態絲毫不包孕着都市裏的虚僞的病象。</p>
<p>内地的水碼頭，委實是婦女們開露天談話會的好去處；我每天中午，傍晚，在那裏閒眺散步，婦女們的嬌聲，激動着流水的絃奏，每引起我内心一種深刻的不可說的留戀。</p>

<p>這眞是一件怪有趣的事情，隔壁的王家夫婦，爲了一句閒話不合，二人竟因此吵起嘴來，男人是一個孔武有力的朋友，所以他的妻子時常被他一把頭髮抓住了打。</p>
<p>可是婦人家受到了委曲，舊式女子仍用一哭二餓三上吊的老法門。不像時代女子用的一哭二跑三離婚的新法。王家婦人在上一次受到了委曲以後，伊哭和餓都做到了，丈夫是不理睬伊，伊就進而做第三步工作了，拿了一根繩，在房内做起上吊的把獻來了。正在懸樑高掛的當兒，不知怎的，却被伊的丈夫知道了。急急的跑到房内，把它打了三句反手巴掌，伊雖吃了三下巴掌，但是很情願，因爲是習俗吿訴伊，救吊死的一定要打三句反手巴掌，纔能嚇走死神。豈知伊丈夫把伊解下之後，反把伊的頸繩收一收緊，問伊可要再尋死？伊本是想嚇嚇丈夫的，那裏知道丈夫眞要伊死，伊只得連忙搖手，丈夫纔鬆了伊。今番一次，也因吵嘴，伊想上吊不靈，改用投河吧！待伊奔到河邊，還没有投到水裏，又被他捉住了。他問伊你要投水嗎？就把伊捉着，反向水内浸了幾次，伊腹内的水也喝飽了。伊着丈夫見死不怕，以後就再也不尋死了。</p>

<p>第三十一回　　三次交鋒白衣衝雪阵　　全營殉國赤眼入槍林</p>
<p>弟兄將口袋裏翻着，果然，有個紙捲，交給了自强，看時，上面先有幾個大些的字，射入眼簾，乃是父親大人安啟。這幾個字，眞不啻敵人的刺刀，紥了心尖一下，自强又昏然了。朦朧中聽到有點名聲，所點的，正是自己這一連弟兄。接着聽到寳芳道：弟兄們，咱們自己相信，不算傻種了，打了兩個勝仗，替咱們中國露臉。我就常說，我寳芳帶的弟兄，没有一個不够朋友的，現在就靈啦。怕什麽？咱們還有三百多人，還大大的可以和小鬼拚一下子。咱們是好種，守着這個寨子，不走，等到援兵來，把寨子交給他們，咱們還要向前進呢？弟兄們…寳芳這一篇訓話不曾說得完，早是聽到震天震地的一下響，一顆砲彈打來了，不知落在什麽地方，搖撼了這堡子裏整個地面。自强躺在坑上，神智可是很淸楚的，他心裏想着，這必是敵人的援兵到了，他們要趁着華軍休息未定，又用生力軍來攻城，這個手段，很是毒辣，他正這樣的推想着，這就聽到屋子外面，一陣脚步響，而且聽到很沉着的一種說話分派聲，分明是弟兄又才開始準備戰鬥了。這已經有了六七分鐘的工夫，便聽到哄通第二下響，又是一個砲彈，落到了堡子裏來。這時，自强萬萬不能忍耐着了。撑起了身子，就在坑頭上爬到土磚塞的窗子眼裏向外張望着，果然看弟兄們抬了子彈箱子，紛紛的向堡城子上面跑了去。同時那砲聲接二連三的向堡子裏放了來。這邊除了機關槍而外，並没有更重的軍器。所以雖是繼續的受着人家砲的威脅，可是只有忍耐着，靜靜的等敵人到來，然後撕殺。（四二九）</p>

<p>老媽子害牙痛，整整一夜没　眼，第二天一淸早，在弄口候到了一個捉牙虫的女人，宛如找到了一位活神仙，歡喜得手無足蹈，忙把伊請進灶披間裏。經了一度的討價還價之後，雙方議定了捉到每一尾牙虫，算一個銅子。據說，是瞧着老媽子吃了家飯，怪可憐的，所以手續費是特别的低廉。</p>
<p>捉牙虫的女人，旣經論妥了虫價，於是從脅下的布包裏，檢出一張黃紙符焚化了，命老媽子用淸水吞下了肚。於是又從布包裏，檢出一枝頭尖尾粗的木簪，把簪頭在一包灰色的藥末裏，攪了一陣，開始在老媽子嘴裏作法。先把老媽子的牙肉戳破了，牙上沾滿了血漬，於是從出血的所在，捉出牙虫來，放在水碗裏。</p>
<p>牙虫愈捉愈多，不多一會，己捉了五十幾尾，浮在水碗裏，雖然每一個牙虫，是只有半粒芝蔴那麽大，但瞧着，是够令人汗毛直豎的　五十幾尾，每尾一個銅子，己需五百多個大錢了，而那女人，還是不停的捉出來。老媽子一面肉痛，一面起了疑心，於是不要捉了，給了捉牙虫的，一個雙毫銀幣，事後，再細細一瞧碗裏的牙虫，却是一顆顆爆裂開了的草子。忙去追捉牙虫的，早已杳如黃鶴了。</p>
<p>接着，仍是整整一晚没闔眼。</p>

<p>某晚，給朋友拉着上某遊藝塲去。</p>
<p>在某一個塲子裏，坐下來之後，女茶房便送過二杯菊花茶來。接着，又送來了二把面巾。</p>
<p>我那朋友，是玩慣這一路的，一伸手，便把那女茶房拉到了鄰座的空椅上坐下了。女茶房是一臉的半推半就，似理不理的神情。我那朋友，便開始問伊是呌甚麽名字，那裏人。一陣子鬼混，那女茶房的面部表情，立刻大變，變得有說有笑了。</p>
<p>臨走時，我那朋友丢給了伊一塊錢，而且又低低的說（開棧房去。）女茶房回頭一笑，也低低地說道（我要一點鐘過，才能走呢。）朋友接着說道，（我在ＸＸ旅館等你。你到時只要問ＸＸ先生在那一號就得了。）</p>
<p>走出遊藝塲大門，我辭着回家。過了一星期，我又遇到了那朋友，問起他那一晚的事。</p>
<p>（那個女茶房，價錢倒很便宜，只是不怎麽潔凈，我給染到了惡疾了。）朋友哭喪着臉說　又過了幾天，因事去找那朋友，據說，因毒發，住進醫院去了。</p>

<p>上海的拆字先生，果然也少不了（文王神課），（運道流年，）的招牌，但是談論休咎吉凶，却並不是上海拆字先生的正業，他們的正當收入，是靠替人寫信。例如自己提不起筆的小商人，小工人，要寫信給家裏的（父母親大人），或（賢妻），得請敎拆字先生。在上海當老媽子的，要寫信給在鄕種田的（夫君），自然也是拆字先生的老主顧。明片二百文，信，至少一角，信紙，信封另加，郵票自備。地址不淸，姓名不對，投得到，投不到，拆字先生是不負責任的。</p>

<p>魏氏又曰。（足陽明胃。受足太陽之表邪。變𤍠入裏。因營衛在表者。原出於胃。故𤍠邪得從營衛通胃之絡入胃。病邪在胃。自當治胃。若手陽明之大腸病。邪及之。亦不必治。）此以太陽傳陽明。爲由營衛通胃之絡矣。柯韻伯則謂心主營。肺主衛。風寒來犯營衛。卽是手經。嗟乎。一營衛也。魏氏用之以說明傷寒傳足陽明胃。柯氏用之以駁斥傷足不傷手。可見無稽之言。任何方面。皆可引用。其無足重輕。可以知矣。要而言之。不認識營衛之果爲何物。不窮究其界限崖岸。漫然擇其有利於吾之說者。引而用之。則逞其筆舌。天地亦可翻覆。上下皆可倒置矣。豈但區區牽合附會醫說而已哉。至謂邪入大腸。可不必治。眞可謂鹵莽滅裂之言矣。</p>
<p>魏氏又曰。（足少陽膽。本爲蒼天生氣。凡一身之氣。無論邪正。皆由少陽而升。故腸胃之邪欲上升者。必傳於膽。病邪在膽。若手少陽三焦。………以其無形。藉軀殼之形爲形。故不能專受傳經病邪。）此說更爲渺茫。可不必辦。</p>
<p>魏氏又曰。（少陽之邪。不升散而傳裏。如木之發火。其烟必投濕。……若手太陰肺。卽有連及之邪。亦不必專治。）此純粹以五行立說。五行之說。今日之舊醫界。亦覺其非。更無俟吾之喋喋矣。</p>
<p>魏氏又曰。（足少陰在下。以水承土。其邪最易入也。邪入足少陰。卽治足少陰矣。若手少陰心經。非邪直犯心。無論何病。俱不受邪。皆以手心主代之。不必治也。）以水承士之言。亦依五行立論。不必辨也。至謂心不受邪。今日之腸窒扶斯。其致死之原因。多爲心臟衰弱。邪之能直犯心臟也。確實有據。主不受犯之言。君主政體下之想像而已。</p>
<p>魏氏又曰（足少陰受邪。無論寒𤍠。皆傳足厥陰腎。水中有火。其氣無論邪正。必緣木而上也。病邪在肝。治必在肝。若手厥陰心包絡。亦惟代心受病。並不受他經之邪。）腎水中有火之說。出自道家。火必緣木。附會易傳。皆屬空想。以腎屬水。以肝屬本。不過漢儒古文家一師之說。又復荒唐。心包洛代心受病。與心主不受邪之說。同一無稽。魏氏之論。無一句是處。</p>
<p>要之方氏以陰陽立說。魏氏以五行爲論。皆不足以證傷寒傳經爲眞理。更不足以證但言足經不言手經爲事實也。</p>
<p>方魏之後。欲於六經尋新出足新生命者。爲慈谿之柯韻伯。柯氏之方曰（仲景於諸病之表裏陰陽。分爲六經。淸理脈證之異同。寒𤍠之虚實。使治病只在六經。夫一身之病。俱受六經範圍者。猶周禮六官以總百職也。若傷寒。不過是六經中一證。叔和不知仲景之六經。是經略之經。而非經絡之經。妄引内經𤍠病論作序例。以冠仲景之書。而混其六經之證治。夫𤍠病之六經。專主經脈爲病。……仲景之六經。是分區地面。所該者廣。凡風寒濕𤍠。内傷外感。自表至裏。寒𤍠虚實。無所不包。所以六經提綱。各立一局。不爲經絡所拘。勿爲風寒畫定也。）此蓋欲於經絡之外。别求六經立足之地。不從方氏之體層陰陽之說。不祖魏氏五行性理之論。而獨以爲區分地面。蓋浸浸乎專以病之證候解說之矣。然其所謂地面者。仍不能脫離經絡之舊窟。故昔人有舉棋不定之　。試詳觀其地面之論。可以知其所持之說。無堅固不拔之特質矣。</p>

<p>（一）關於胎盤之舊說</p>
<p>胎盤，俗稱胞衣。舊醫藉中。稱人胞，曰紫河車。又曰混沌衣。治氣血羸疲。婦人勞損。又治一切產損等症。古方有河車丸，大造丸等。祇因修造極難。故世人用之不多耳。</p>

<p>胎盤者。床脫落膜與脈絡膜所成之扁平卵圓形海綿樣盤狀物也。多血管。帶靑赤色。目姙娠二個月初發生。至姙娠第四個月完成。姙娠末期之胎盤。直徑一五丨二○公分。惟其厚薄。邊緣與胎兒。猶吸烟後之餘燼矣。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（七月八日在民衆敎育館演講稿）</p>
<p>今天承上海市民民衆敎育館館長的待，來貴館演講，關於兒童們的衛生。招鄙人因爲這幾天來診務煩忙，没有一些空閑的時間盡力於社會，非常慚愧。可是盛意難却，所以今天特地抽一些工夫來胡謅幾句。</p>
<p>今天鄙人講的是學科敎授的衛生，和兒童體格的檢查。這是關於兒童身體和將來成人時的幸福上很重大的問題。同時也是我們幾位大敎育家時時刻刻記在心上，要想切實幹去的事情。我們要知道在敎育的時候，能够適當應用衛生的方法，對於在學的兒童心身上的發育，有很大的好影響，當然不必說。所以學校衛生書中常常把關於敎授各學科時的衛生方法詳細論述的。</p>
<p>第一　　學科敎授的衛生</p>
<p>在敎學的時候，應該注意的而最要的，是兒童們的姿勢是否正當。姿勢的第一要素，是胸廓左右均等發達。講到胸廓的部分初生的小兒和成人是絶對不同樣的。初生兒的脊柱，成一直線，没有彎曲，肋骨的直徑和脊柱成直角。肋骨四周造成的胸廓壁，成圓筒形，很像裝水泥的木桶樣子。等到能够營步行運動的時候，胸廓最初因爲要支持頭部的重量，其次因爲内臟的重量的他自己的重量，於是前壁被牽引到下方。而肋骨對於脊柱有傾斜到前下方的趨勢。那時候的脊柱，因爲重心的關係，起一定的彎曲。因爲這些原因，於是胸廓逐漸變成扁平，而成人的胸廓的横斷面，就成爲廓圓形，脊柱部又凸隆到前方。這樣的胸廓，是我們全身軀幹的基礎而爲姿勢的主要部。</p>
<p>身體的姿勢前後左右要匀稱，而四肢的發達也要適當。但是嚴密研究起來，我們人類的身體，左右並不相等的。左右的眼梢（眥）並不在同一高低線上；左右兩鼻孔形狀，也各有異同；左右四肢的粗細，也是不同。就是胸廓，也是左右不同的。再嚴密測計兩肩的高低，也有些不同。這樣左右不相稱的原因，是在乎内部臟器的位置和日常生活的習慣運動勞力的多少而使然的。如果程度深的，那末内臟的地位和作用，要大受影響。這就要成爲不良姿勢了。兒童們因爲幼小的時候，做父母的不能合理的護育，以致起脊柱彎曲（如駝背之類）和胸廓變形的很多很多。胸廓變形中最多的，像左右的不對稱，漏斗狀胸，雞胸，酒桶狀胸，萎縮胸，胸廓一部凸隆等都是。這許多變形，我們統稱爲不良姿勢。在學校中要訓練兒童實踐衛生，防止不良姿勢的造成，那就是養成健康國民的基礎。尤其在讀書，寫字，圖畫，算術，工作等學科時，兒童們最易取駝背樣的姿勢。這時候更應該充分注意他們的。</p>
<p>再講到讀書寫字，是我們在學校中的兒童，天天要做的事情。我國人的寫字，尤其比外國人來得複雜，旣要寫本國字，又要寫西洋字，有時候還要寫注音符號。就是用的寫字工具，有毛筆，又有鉛筆，石筆，鋼筆。還有紛筆，像這樣的繁多工作，又要天天去做，那末對於身體姿勢形成變態的機會非常之多，豈能不去十分注意呢？</p>
<p>第三　體格檢查</p>
<p>學校中在每一學期的開始，必定費了幾天工夫，替學生檢查體格。此外還有因爲種種目的而臨時施行體格檢查的。試想爲什麽敎育家願意犧牲這麽多的寳貴光陰，來幹這個工作呢？那就是說：兒童們每年施行體格檢查，可以使他們在健康保作或健康增進上得到一種贵重的記錄和統計。可是現在學校中對於多數學生，因爲時間關系，竟不實行完備的理想的體格檢查，那眞是很可惜撮</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>（甲）體格檢查的價値　我們把敎育可分爲精神方面和身體方面二種目標：身體方面的敎育，就是體育。而檢查體格，也是屬於體育一類中的。其結果當然進而講求適當的敎育法，像檢查體格之後，把兒童區分爲身體虚弱者和强健者二大類，而各别施行適當的體育。對於發育或營養不良者，要講求助成發育和增進營養的方法。對於有缺點的或疾病者，應該施以矯正和療治。</p>

<p>第四章　肺結核之演進</p>
<p>滲出性炎症是如何的現象呢？他是有滲出物爲其特徵的。這一種原因，係完全因血管壁起變化而致的；那時血管腔擴張，血液成分，於是也滲出到管壁外面，這樣一來，周圍组織係被浸潤了，局部從此也現潮紅腫脹狀態了。這一種經過，我們呌作（滲出作用）；這滲出血管外的血球和液體，卽剛綫所說的（滲出物一是。這種血球，以多核的白血球最多。此種滲出性炎症，又因滲出物的性質狀態，和病理上的變化，各種不同，有漿液性加答兒性出血性化膿性腐敗性等種種分别；這裏面的性態，當然是大嫌專門的，所以我也一槪節去不談了。</p>
<p>第二種是增生性炎症，尋常又呌做產生性，他係以結締組織的增生爲特徵的。這增生組織的成分，除新生毛細管外，更有種種細胞產出的。這一種狀態，大半爲每一種炎症痊愈的現象；但在發病時卽呈現這樣的變化，也是有的。　　明的了滲出性和增生性炎症的大槪情形，那末，我們不妨再進一步，談談結核症（狹義的說卽肺結核症）在人體組織裏面所發生的變化。我們要曉得，結核菌一侵入人體裏面，他於是在這裏面發育繁殖了，結果構成了一個硬固的小結節，這就是無人不知的（結核）了。他是由肉芽組織構成的；裏面不含有血管，至少的限度可以說，血管是非常貧乏的；所以裏面營養時常缺乏。結果易成（壞死）狀態的。</p>

<p>（四）談談一種由淋疾而來的眼病</p>
<p>初生兒膿漏眼的發生。大槪在產後第三日或第五日。他的傳染不是在產道直接感染。就是在分娩後間接感染。但是　褥婦如果本來没有淋疾。那　　初生兒也不會有傳染的機會了。講到他的危險。雖然比較成人性膿漏眼的危險少　　，治療如果得當。也容易好。不過　　　　起來。並不是這個樣。因爲到醫生那裏去求診的時候。大都已經發生上面所講的危險。總免不了失明的可慘結果。我記得在德國參觀盲童學校的時候。曾知道盲童因爲生了初生兒膿漏眼而失明的。有全數的百分之三十至五十以上。還有據某醫學家的調查。知道在生後第一年失明的一千零四十人中。到有七百五十三人。是因爲生了初生兒膿漏眼的緣故。照這樣看起來。初生兒膿漏眼和成人性膿漏眼一樣的危險可怕。也就可以證明淋疾同眼病的親密關係了。這種病最好住院隔離治療。千萬不可讓一知半解的自命醫師濫治。否則一旦錯過治療時期。那就免不了做一個盲人。我現在再把這種病的預防法。分條說一說。如果可以實行。未嘗不是一個安全的辦法啊。</p>
<p>（甲）對於已患洒病的人。（一）無論男女患有淋病的時候。應當卽刻囑托正式專科醫師診治。不可遷延時期。（二）飲食洗臉前。同小便後。應當用石炭酸肥皂洗凈兩手。不要自己直接傳染眼内。（三）衣裤不要和别人的一同洗滌。</p>
<p>（乙）對於未患淋疾的人。（二）勿多接近已患淋疾的人。（二）少用公共塲所的手巾。（三）禁止不潔的性交。可以减少間接傳染的機會。</p>
<p>（丙）對於初生兒膿漏眼的預防。這是產科醫師或助產醫士應當做的一件事體。在歐美各國及日本法律上。已有强制履行的規定。不知道我國有没有這條法律。不過一般正式產科醫師及助產醫士早已實行這條法律了。這條法律的辦法。就是依照一千八百八十二年克來特氏Ｃｒｅｄｅ所創行的方法。這個方法就是在小兒分娩後。洗淸全身同顏面。再用百分之二的硝酸銀水。滴入兩眼。在預防初生兒膿漏眼上講起來。敢說確實有效。近來有人改用百分之十至百分之二十的蛋白銀一類的藥。像ＴａｒｇｅｓｉｎＰｒｏｔａｎｇｅｌ等等。他的效力。也不錯啊。不過我國家有许多收生婆。不知道用不用這種預防法。這是屬於衛生行政上的事體。我是　　　什麽責備的話。祇好　求　　　　　　　　　　。（未完）</p>

<p>— 李辉英</p>
<p>坐上南滿路的火車上，人人都會引起幾種共同的感覺，那就是車裏面非常淸潔，車行平穏，而且少有乘客擁擠的事情。</p>
<p>但是，你也總少不了有一種相反的感覺，覺得你自己不是坐在火車裏，而是寄人籬下可憐的小鳥，車主人是一隻大鷹，無時無刻不在張着大口準備把你吞進牠的大肚子裏。</p>
<p>因此，前幾種感覺，其結果，使我們欽佩别人辦事的認眞，收到良好的結果，而後種感覺又使我們坐享其利的人感到漸愧，感到某種不自由而心驚不止的。</p>
<p>從長春南行，沿路盡是廣大的平原，這就是地理上關東平原的一部。四平街是長春瀋陽間最大的車站，同時又是糧實皮貨集合處。四洮路伸着長脖子到内蒙的邊陲，吞了一肚子糧實皮貨回來，一火車一火車地載到大連去，同時，遼寗北部，吉林西南部的農民們，也全在年終趕着四套馬或是六套馬大車，把糧實載到這裏銷售。但火車未通之前，代替四平街的地位的，聽說是鐵嶺。</p>
<p>再往南，土脈多是紅色的，沿綫農產多高梁，因爲這是遼寗人主要的食米，可是從去年以來，坐火車的人就看不到在二十里内有那綠莖红穗的東西了，這是日本人怕在田裏窩藏義勇軍的原故。　　遼陽南，海城北，鞍山車站，是不能不特别提出的，因爲這裏有一個很大的（究竟大到怎樣還是說不出）（鞍山製鐵所，）日本國内的製鐵所，没有幾個能和它相提並論的。坐在火車裏，遇到早上或是晚上，你就會看到兩旁提籃上工下工的中國賤價勞工，像珠串一般帶着一副一副的黃瘦面孔奔走着，他們都是從田地上脫開身子走到鐵廠給日本帝國主義賣血汗的奴隸。他們只能作着普通工作，聽說另外有些秘密工作，全由日本人自己作着，究竟是作些什麽，是外人說不出的，但由於是綱鐵廠，人們還是能想到十分有九分是在秘密製造殺人利器。</p>
<p>這以南，山漸漸多起來了，不過，全是秃的，那種頽靡不振的樣子，宛若冬天裏缺衣少食的乞丐。到瓦房店車站，情形又不然了，山領漸漸加多，每個山上都穿上碧綠的松衣，卽在岩石壁立的山上，也還是綠松滿地，不過是松枝稍微矮小，那是由於種植時間晚了一些。　　金州以南，沿路多菓子，特别是蘋菓，銷行範圍，已經突出南滿綫而遍及東北全土了，單只這一項蘋菓收入，每年就給日本人增加了很大的一筆進欵。　　南滿車上吃東西很便當，因爲車中有專賣小食的人，全是日本貨，不過，都很淸潔。乘客，十分之八是我們的同胞們。</p>
<p>現在每個車站上，都圍起來重重的鐵絲網，這可說是九一八事變後的新建設，還有車站上堆積的沙堆，都是爲防備義勇軍襲擊的新產物。</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>翻開小說半月刊第三期，便見郁達夫先生手寫的臨安道中書所見詩：</p>
<p>（泥壁芽蓬四五家，山茶初茁兩三芽；天晴男女忙農去，閒煞門前一樹花。）　不禁想起陸放翁的詩，幸稼軒的詞來。這輕鬆的農村風物，如三月和風，使人人路然塵外之想。可是我從農村來，頗知農村事，這詩的農村剪影，全是文人的幻覺。</p>
<p>近月天旱得很久了，水車該十二分的忙了。文人設想：明月一鈎，疎星數點，凉風輕送，薄露浸衣，這時手攀着横竿，脚踏着桔橰，依　水車聲與歌聲悠揚交作，這是多麽有詩意的勾當。前人詩云：（和風送得桔橰聲），有不令人神往者乎！然而，這一轉，要轉出（竟有大謬不然者）的結論來了。水車的身子，要用極細緻極堅硬的木頭來做成，因爲車身有時，浸在水裏，有時囇在太陽裏，不用這種木料，就容易龜裂；車踏和車輪要載三五個人，也得用細緻堅硬的木頭；水車渾身統是沉沉重的，四個詩人抬不了一輛車身，三雙文豪背不得一架車輪。車水常在溪邊塘埪，溪岸高，塘水深，（兩人車）是不足以勝任的；常是丈八車身，（四五人車）架在那里。當水多的時候，四五人同時踏水，一脚一脚挨下去，如挑千斤担，簡直半點偷懶不得；汗淌了，氣喘了，脚底發𤍠發泡了，還得一脚一脚挨下去。水淺下去了，車身輕鬆了，可是正發肥的稻苗，比嬰孩吃奶還急迫，望着亁枯的溪塘，更使人焦急萬狀。溪塘乾枯了，唯一的水源，只好依靠地底的山泉，挖地丈來深，等候三五點鐘，水泉才　滿一小潭；這泉水比黃金還要値錢。有時地高水小；聯車盤不上去，眼巴巴望着田禾枯了焦了，只好付之長歎！先父在世日，說起先祖壯年孤苦，天旱車水，力不能勝，先祖母用兩手扳送；指畫相示，涙如雨下。夜深人靜，每聞依　車聲，有如幽靈哀號，凄惋不堪終聽。可惜這一種實感，從不曾寫入诗人筆底呢！</p>
<p>李商隠詩：（停車臥看楓林晚，霜葉紅於二月花。）秋山看紅葉，高爽的天空，襯着如火的霜葉，此中自有至趣。紅葉，以烏柏葉爲尤佳美；其葉，比楓葉更密集，寒霜旣降，柏葉驟變，淡黃深紅，錯雜其中；彌山滿野，煊染成一幅大圖畫；詩人也愛把這個寫入　底。但農民自來不把這紅葉當一回事；紅葉旣落，烏柏子成熟了，銀白的柏子從黑亮中裂出，大的小的男的女的，大家到山野間去採摘柏子；柏子油用以點燈，柏子壳用以生火，柏子餅用以肥田，農民把這當作冬季的一筆收入。說起採拍子，我就毛髮竦然；柏樹上有一種毛蟲，雖是經了濃霜，還是活着，幾乎每樹必有。蟲一着身，發癢起泡，痛楚不可少耐；焚稻草薫灼，也得四五小時始復常態；或用菜油和鹽遍擦，隠隠作痛；此時即有十斗詩情，也化作憤火百升了！前年，在眞如鄕間，看見一樹紅柏，不覺動懷鄕之念；連想及於毛蟲，又心膽爲寒；一年一度苦毛蟲，此又詩人詠紅葉時所不及料者也。</p>
<p>夏日看荷採蓮，自是雅事。出水芙渠，嬌艷欲滴；田田荷葉，别有淸香；人間天上，此景不殊。新蓮鮮嫩，入口甜軟，更是可口佳物。（採蓮復採蓮，蓮葉何田田。）在荷叢的農民，不啻神仙中人。好，那就請詩人去採蓮吧！荷桿上滿生着細刺，兩脚過處，觸股若割，一度採蓮，正如凌遲一次。水中多螞蟥，叮股吸血，每作寄癢；又不可立拔，拔則頭斷入膚，侵入血管。這種種况味，又遠出詩人想像之外！</p>
<p>因此，我看了郁達夫先生的即事詩，又不禁想起魯迅先生的風波來：</p>
<p>（老人男人坐在矮凳上，搖着大芭蕉閒談，孩子飛也似的跑，或者蹲在烏柏樹下賭玩石子。女人端出烏黑的蒸乾菜和松花黃的米飯，𤍠蓬蓬冒烟。河裏駛過文人的酒船；文豪見了，大發詩興，說：（無思無慮，這眞是田家樂呵。）</p>
<p>但文豪的話有些不合事實，就因爲他們没有聽到九斤老太的話。……）</p>

<p>— 曹鵠雛</p>
<p>我總忖不懂，一百，一千，一萬個忖不懂：我們村子裏難道没有旁的人嗎，爲什麽偏要讓王老頭子做鄕長！</p>
<p>隔壁李家公公，說王老頭子是讀書人，是前淸的秀才，我們村子裏要算他的資格頂老，名望頂大，自然配做鄕長。</p>
<p>哼！讀書人！讀書人有什麽用？讀書人祇會喫飯，不會種田；祇會踱方步，不會趕長路；祇會搖頭擺尾哼幾句爛調，不會着着實實去做事。他們的身材瘦得像茄乾般，手膀細得和枯柴桿一模一樣，不要說，去打車洋人，用不着他們，就是呌他們去和村口的張二嫂翻一翻手掌，也要喊救命呢。前天橋頭小店裏的老板說；（我們中國窮到這個地步，被外國人欺侮到這個田地，實在是讀書人太多了的緣故；因爲中國的讀書人，大都祇會喫閒飯，搭架子，讀幾句死書，不肯着着實實去做事。）這句話仔細想起來，倒也有些道理。</p>
<p>哼！王老頭子是讀書人，看他有什麽本領？人家說他念過很多的書，肚子很通，而且能够寫得一手好字，南鄕幾個村子裏，要算他數一不數二的老牌秀才了。哼！肚子通，不會做事，有什麽用？字寫得好，祇會在大家的賣田契上，打幾個花押出風頭，不會握鋤頭掏地，有什麽用？如果我們村子裏的人，個個都像他不做事，不會握鋤頭掏地，就是天老爺可憐我們，長年風調雨順，也要田荒地枯，個個做餓死鬼了。哼！王老頭子配做鄕長，眞是皇天没有眼睛，人家個個尊敬他，拍他的馬屁，我却不服氣。</p>
<p>李家婆婆說：（讀書人是懂得道理的，何况王先生是南鄕有名的秀才先生，這把鄕長的交椅，不尊他坐，還有誰够得上資格。）</p>
<p>哼！老婆子懂得什麽！讀書人懂得道理這句話，我也不相信。縣裏的郭老鄕绅，不是世代書香，很有名聲的讀書人嗎？舊年三月裏，他爲什麽要謀奪他的寡居阿嫂的財產，害得他的嫂嫂投河尋死呢！東村學堂裏的敎書先生，當然是讀書人了。前幾年辦土地陳報，他爲什麽也要揩油，把公家的錢塞進自己的腰包裏去，坐了三個月的監牢呢！舊年我做生活的東家，第二個小老板，不是什麽大學畢業生嗎？他爲什麽不好好的去做些事業，偏偏要和流氓做伙伴，一天到晚，濫嫖濫賭，結果被他的老子攆走，不認是自己的兒子呢？你說王老頭子是懂得道理的讀書人嗎？他旣然做了鄕長，怎麽祇曉得向縣官，局長和城裏的大紳士拍馬屁，一些不知道辦村子裏的事情呢？村子裏年成不好，他不管；村子裏的人害了瘟病，他也不管；村子裏强盜來了，他更不管。這些還猶可，他天天躱在雅片燈旁，刮着肚腸油，打算怎樣去敲某人的竹槓，打算怎樣去揩一筆油；打算怎樣去巴結上司；打算怎樣去吊一個女人的膀子，……這種下流行爲，難道也好算做懂得道理嗎？</p>
<p>呵！呵！講起女人，眞把我的肚子，也要氣破了！昨天我在南河頭大樹下跟阿桂姐談天，被這個老賊看見了。他居然敎訓我起來，說我不該調戲女人，要是下次再是這樣，定要把我送到公安局裏去。　他的娘！他不摸摸自己的屁股，反而敎訓我起來！他早年的事，誰人不知，那個不曉？我是一個光棍漢，阿桂姐是捱近三十歲的老大姑娘，大家談談情，也算不得一回什麽事。何况我們除了見面時候，談幾句天以外，從來不曾有過偷偷摸摸的勾當；比之禽獸還不如的他，總要正當些，難道爲了他是讀書人，是秀才，是鄕長，便可横行不法，肆無忌憚，把下流行爲，也可算做正當道理嗎？難道我們窮人在白天太陽底下和心愛的人談幾句天，便算犯罪嗎？　他的娘！那個時候，要是我不怕阿桂姐吃驚的話，我一定要孝敬那個不要臉的老賊幾個耳光咧！</p>
<p>歸根一句話：王老頭子那種人，配做鄕長，眞的豈有此理，一百個，一千個，一萬個豈有此理！别人都尊敬他，拍他的馬屁，我偏偏不服氣；要我碰見了他，不白他幾眼，除非天地翻身，橫竪我不想靠他的牌頭，不想吃他的一顆飯粒。</p>

<h3 id="c240">進口稅則编訂之方法 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 葉子休</p>
<p>進口稅則有限制進口貿易之作用，故論者有關稅壁壘之稱。其實此項譬語尙不甚確切；與其謂爲壁壘，不如謂爲水閘。蓋稅則之作用不獨在限制貿易，同時又有調節之機能，如水閘之調節水流也。夫水閘之建築需要相當技術，不僅以高大爲得計，編訂稅則亦何獨不然。我國關稅自主以來稅率一再增高，國人論稅則者每多就稅率高下爲言，於稅則本身之組織似尙少注意，爰就編訂方法略述之。</p>
<p>編訂稅則之工作步驟大體可别爲四項，即（歸類），（分目），（定式）及（定率）也。</p>
<p>（一）所謂（歸類）者，商品千差萬别，首當按其性質歸納成一定系統，庶幾　舉目張，有條不紊，無遺漏，少牽連。歸類方式約有四種，或按稅率輕重，或按文字順序，或按生產系統，或按貨品用途。前二種方式較簡陋，條目簡少者方可採用。後二種方式比較精當，通常稅則多採用之。其間亦各有利弊。若純按生產系統歸類，普通大宗貨品自原料以至成品雖可有確定不移之次序，但辦製品則處置困難。若依用途歸類，雖無雜製品之困難，但對於一種貨品而有多種用途者亦不免左右爲難。故通常稅則大都斟酌於兩者之間而略加變通。變通之方法因各國情形不同而大有差異。例如某種貨品在某國爲進口大宗，或不妨特立爲一類，以示鄭重，若他國絶少進口，自無此必要，又如某種貨品在甲國用爲食料，在乙國或僅作工業原料，用途不同，歸類結果自不免有異。前國際經濟會議有劃一列國稅則分類之建議，原則雖經通過，終無成就者，即此故也。</p>
<p>（二）所謂（分目）者，將一項貨品按性質區分爲若干目，其目的在調整稅率或便利差别待遇。就差别待遇而論，同一項貨品之中有爲國内可以製造者，亦有爲不能製造者，有以甲國货進口居多者，有以乙國貨爲多者，欲謀適當對策自非分别淸楚不可。就調整稅率而論，同一項貨品之中優等貨與次等貨價格或相差甚遠，若予以同一稅率，負担不免畸輕畸重。例如某項貨品每單位價値自一元至十元不等，若稅率定爲一元，在優等貨僅合値百抽十，而次等貨則達値百抽百矣。在此種情勢下不得不酌量分爲若干目，而各配以輕重適宜之稅率。分目之標凖或以大小，或以輕重，或以長短，或以價格，或以某項貨品之特殊性質，例如棉紗之支數，布之經緯綫數，糖之旋光度，酒之成分等。總須有明顯界限，確切不移方向。有時一項貨品可有多種分法，究以何者爲適宜，則須視需要爲轉移。且有時爲需要起見，亦有明知可以分目而故意不分目者。例如某項貨品中之低級品國内可以製造，而高級品尙無製造之可能，則在相當情勢下，不計精粗予以同一稅率，使高級品貿易不受妨害，同時又可予低級品以進口之限制，亦未始不可。故分目並不以多爲貴，繁簡恰合需要方爲上選。</p>
<p>（三）所謂（定式）者，規定稅率形式之謂也。稅率形式约有（從價），（從量），（從價兼從量），及（從價或從量）四種。（從價）係按貨値計算，不計數量多寡，例如綢緞値百抽百，雜糧値百抽十是也。（從量）係按貨量多少計算，不計價値貴賤，例如手帕每打三角，鈕扣每羅六分是也。此兩種形式各有利弊，大體可從三點辨别之。第一，就負担公平而論，從價稅顯然比較靈活，不致有畸輕畸重之情勢。從量稅則適得其反，不論分目如何精密，在同一目中終不免有輕征高貨而重征次貨之情勢，惟分目愈精密則差額愈小而已。第二，就稅務行政而論，利弊正相反。從量稅征收手續簡便，從價稅於估價高低易生爭執，而稅收多寡爲物價漲落所左右，尤覺不便。第三，就保護効力而論，從量稅切實可靠，國内外貨價之差額旣經規定，確定而不可移。反之，從價稅常因貨價之變動而變動，貨價愈漲而稅率愈重，固有過份妨害貿易之虞，貨價愈跌而稅率愈輕，亦易爲傾銷者所玩弄。例如某種貨品每單位價格原爲十元，從價稅爲値百抽四十，當合四元。若貨價漲爲十五元値百抽四十當合六元。貨價　漲或已難合銷，稅率亦提高何異落井下石。反之，货價跌爲五元，値百抽四十僅合二元，貨價跌爲二元半，値百抽四十僅合一元。貨價銳减或已爲國内廠商所不可忍受，稅率亦無形减輕，又何異爲虎添翼。從價從量旣各有利弊，故有將此兩種形式參合應用者，即（從價兼從量）是也。例如呢帽每打三元又値百抽二十。同時有二重稅率。此種形式雖能兼具從價從量兩方之長，同時亦承襲兩方之短，而計算更覺複雜。然稅率隨貨價之漲而漸漸增高，隨貨價之跌而漸漸减輕，旣不若從量稅之一成不變，亦不若從價稅之極度增减，在相當範圍内，於稅收有益，則爲他種形式所不及。至於（從價或從量）之形式，係從價從量稅率並列而儘高採用（　低採用者絶少，蓋選擇權衡將轉　於商人之手也。），例如呢帽從價値百抽四十，惟不得少於每打五元。此種形式對於高級品爲從價，對於低級品爲從量，於不妨害高級品貿易之中，而專防止廉價品之侵入，保護幼稚工業之効用最宏。除上述四種形式外，尙有所謂（滑動稅率）與（限量稅率）者。（滑動稅率）者因季節之變動或貨價之上落而異其稅率，其目的偏重調節產銷及平凖貨價，施用於農產物者爲多。例如菓品稅於秋收時提高，至靑黃不接時則减低；又如糧食稅國於内價格低廉時提高，至價格高昂時則减稅或免稅。（限量稅率）者，規定每年或每季進口數量，在數量限度内之進口貨徵以较低稅率，滿額之後則提高稅率或禁止進口，其目的亦在保護產業，施用於工業品者爲多。細究此兩種稅率之性質，不同之稅率並非同時施行，不過稅率增减較普通修訂爲靈活而已，稅率形式仍不出上列四種之外。稅率形式之變化大體已如上述，至於實際上究應採用何種爲妥善，殊少確定辦法可言。可得而言者，大宗貨品高下相差不遠者宜（從量），零星貨品價格出入甚鉅者可（從價）：意在保護產業，或防止廉價貨品之傾銷者宜儘量採用（從量）及（從價或從量）之形式；意在財政收入而百分稅率甚高者可採用（從價）或（從價兼從量）之形式。</p>
<p>（四）所謂（定率）者，厘定稅率輕重數字也。厘定之方式大略可别爲（直接）（間接）二種。（直接方式）者，直接規定每單位徵稅若干。數字之高下由比較舶來品及國產品之生產成本或售價而定。此種方式之主旨在保護產業，使不受舶來品之不正當的壓迫，稅收之增减則不甚重視，（間接方式）者，先按各類貨品規定百分率之輕重，例如奢侈品稅率應高，必需品稅率應低，製成之奢侈品稅率應最高，必需之原料品稅率應特低。若稅率形式不宜從價，則根據所定之標凖完稅價格折算之。例如某種貨品之百分率定爲値百抽三十，若標凖價格爲每單位二十元，則從量稅率應爲六元。標凖完稅價格之計算或按國内市價酌减稅率佣金等項，或按國外市價酌加運費等項，視情形而定，在理論上二法均以求得貨品到海達關時之價格爲目的，原則並無不同。惟無論以何種方法計算價格，結果均須加以調整。調整價格之意義有二。其一，貨品花色衆多，無論分目如何精密，絶無每一種牌號給以一種稅率之可能，高下不等之各牌號集於一目中，則各牌號間銷數之消長每足以影響平均價格之上落。此種上落非眞正貨價之上落，在計算稅率時自難以取作標凖，否則高低各牌號之銷數常有變動，稅率亦隨之而屢進屢退，殊無謂也。其二，就各目之價格比較觀之，或有高下反常而不合事理也。例如某種加工品進口或多爲次等貨，同時未加工品者反多爲高等貨，若從量稅率按實計算，加工品稅率或反較未加工者爲低，與厘定稅率之原則根本不合。在此種情勢下，雖明知所計算之價格確實可靠，亦不得不將加工品之價格酌量提高，或將未加工者酌量减低。價格旣經調整後，所計算之稅率目不能無出入，不明實情者或將指爲估價不符，而實則爲事實所限，有不得不然者也。爲避免此種糾緾計，有時可採用（比加法），超脫於貨價之外，規定加工品按未加工品徵稅，而另外附加若干。附加之數，或爲按貨値値百抽幾之百分數，或爲按未加工品稅率之百分數，或爲每單位若干之從量形式。此種附加辦法可謂爲間接定率方式之中，採用直接定率方式爲變通者也。以上將直接間接二種定率方式大略說明。大抵間接方式適用於一般普通貨品，直接方式應用於少數特殊品目。前者爲粗放的，後者爲精細的；前者爲穏妥的，後者爲扼要的；前者猶之繪圖之起草底，鈎出稅率之分配輪廓，後者乃對於某部分之精細的描寫。稅則條目繁多，一一詳細研究，乃事實上所不能，何處應用直接方式精密計算，何處可用間接方式求其大致不差，或更略加變通，則均視關稅政策爲轉移矣。然所謂關稅政策亦不外從事實上推敲。就保護產業而論；似乎稅率愈高愈佳，但保護過度徒然增加消費者之負擔，致成粗製濫造之弊，或轉足以妨害其他事業之發展。就稅收而論，稅率增則稅收多，亦似爲極明顯之關係，然有時則不盡然。稅率增加過分，或運口數量减少，或引起走私漏稅之弊，稅收不但不增，或反减少。故厘定稅率必先對於國内外產銷狀况有相當了解，然後　酌生產者消費者行政及稅收各方情勢，於最低之免稅點，直至最高之禁止點中，擇一適宜之地位。縱不能達到增一分不可，减一分不能之精密地步，要當有相當計算。否則，僅憑直覺，任意爲之，鮮有不償事者。</p>

<p>— 光</p>
<p>我國國定進口稅則，當國民政府於民國十六年七月二十三日，宣佈關稅自主時，即訂有一種國定進口稅關稅暫行條例，並定於七月一日實施。孰知日英兩國，首先反對，卒不果行。逮民國十七年六月，國内已吿統一，國民政府，鑒於過去單純宣言關稅自主之無效，乃改變方針，謀於修約方面，求關稅自主之實現，因而採取廢約與改約兩種辦法，分别進行。歷經折衝，各國以次就範；茲將國民政府在民國十七年份對各國簽訂條約，表列如左：</p>
<p>整理中美兩國關稅關係條約…十七年七月二十五日中德條約……民國十七年八月十七日中挪關稅條約…十七年十一月十二日中和關稅條約…十七年十一月十九日中瑞（瑞典）關稅條約…十七年十二月二十日中英關稅條約…十七年十二月二十日中法關稅條約…十七年十二月二十二日中比條約之關稅條欵…十七年十一月廿二日中義條約之關稅條欵…十七年十一月廿七日中丹條約之關稅條欵…十七年十二月十二日中葡條約之關稅條欵…十七年十二月十二日中西條約之關稅條欵…十七年十二月廿七日　　國民政府，旣與各國訂立關稅條欵，關稅自主，本可早日實現。不料日本留難，　延甚久，殆無結果。我國乃以比較易行之七種差等稅率爲基礎，而定一種過渡稅率，此即民國十七年十二月七日所頒布之海關進口稅則，而决定自十八年二月一日起實施者也。及至民國十九年五月，中日締結互惠關稅恊定，國定稅則委員會，乃重行編定新稅則，國民政府遂於十九年十二月二十九日公佈，自翌年一月一日起實施。</p>
<p>民國二十二年五月，適中日關稅互惠恊定施行三年期滿，我國當局，鑒於實際上之需要，特將十九年進口稅則，全部加以改訂整理，於五月二十二日起發生效力。</p>
<p>此項修正國定進口稅則，頗能表見關稅自主精神。對於棉布及製品類，人造絲及其製品，水產品，烟酒等貨物，稅率特爲提高。人造絲及酒料稅率，有自百分之三○丨五○，提高至百份之八十者，對魚介水產品各項稅率，平均提高二倍以上也。</p>
<p>迄至本年六月，我國財政當局，爲保護本國工商業與維持國際貿易起見，將海關進口稅則，加以增减，業經國府修正公佈，於七月二日起實行。新稅則分類號列，與前相同，不稍變更。各項貨物新稅率其增减之數，列舉如左貨品名稱　增减說明漂白或染色棉剪絨回絨　减每公一角尺减一二厘至</p>

<p>— 沛</p>
<p>日本對華貿易，素以棉貨，糖，紙，棉紗，麫粉，機械，魚介水產品等爲大宗。自大戰以來，未有多大雙遷。其中棉貨一項，除一九二八年外，歷年來均占輸華商品之第一位。此外，糖，紙，與麫粉，互爭第二位。煤，及鋼鐵等類，亦爲大宗商品。茲將日本輸華商品變遷列表如下：</p>

<h3 id="c251">中日兄弟說 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 明堂</p>
<p>報載顏惠慶談話，謂彼曾對日人云，中日本屬兄弟，東方現存黃種人國家，惟中日兩國爲最大，故應互相合作，以謀共存共榮云。中國與日本，在種族上言，確屬是兄弟；東方現存黃種人國家，確亦以中日爲最大，亦是黃種人僅存的國家；中日兩國，在種族上言，確乎是應該互相扶助，以謀共存共榮的。卽日本人，他們也常喊中日應共存共榮的，然而其結果，却是日本人希圖獨覇東亞，壓倒中國人，成就其一個國家的獨存獨榮。這又是從何說起呢？</p>
<p>中國與日本，在理論上，在事實上，都應共同合作，以謀東亞人之發展東亞。然而日本人却偏要欺壓中國人，說什麽東亞門羅主義，讓這廣大的中國，爲他一個人獨自宰割，這是有一定的原因的。這原因便是日本的少數有錢人，貴人，高等人，希望在中國可以得到一筆更大的財源，去謀他們幾個人的所謂皇國的發展，這才是他們所以要謀獨吞中國的原因。這少數日本的有錢人，貴人，高等人，因爲在本國剝削得民衆够了，垂危的日本農民，苦人，已不能再被他們剝削，於是，聰明的日本有錢人等，乃不得不想法到剝削到國外。這才是他們所以要侵略到國外的一個動機。再則，日本有錢人的地位的增高，在原則上也非向外剝削不可，這又是一定的事實。因此，日本人（當然少數人）壓迫中國的事實，是有一定的歷史的原因决定的。這不是幾個日本人的不好，或是中國人的特别應該受剝削，而是錢的關係，使他們不得不如此。明乎此，則所謂種族之見，也就完全没有什麽關係了。</p>
<p>日本人的侵略中國，完全爲錢的關係，因之，日本人的與中國人是不是兄弟，怎樣做兄弟，兄弟是屬於那一種人才做得，所謂兄弟，是不是應該以錢的關係來分别？這些問題也就完全可以明白了。就是說，所謂兄弟是極應該以錢的關係來分别的。日本大多數的民衆（覺醒的民衆），爲日本少數的有錢人所壓迫，所欺騙，同樣，中國大多數的民衆，也爲日本少數有錢人所壓迫，所欺騙，這樣，在被壓迫被欺騙的立塲上，中國大多數民衆，與日本大多數民衆，就可成爲兄弟，成爲朋友。事實上也確乎是如此。反之，少數有錢的日本人，與少數以錢立命之日本軍閥，能幡然覺悟，不侵略中國人，不壓迫欺騙中國人，使國與國之間，没有什麽分别，亦可成爲兄弟，然而試問能不能呢？</p>
<h3 id="c252">廣州的茶樓 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 何覺夫</p>
<p>凡是到過廣州的人，廣州的茶樓總會在他的腦子中留下一個深刻的印象吧！</p>
<p>說起廣州的茶樓，也着實是多得令人記不淸，不管是大街小巷，到處都可以找得到的：甚連附近的鄕村，也常會發現三二間用茅草蓋起的茶寮。</p>
<p>在廣州，飲茶已是成爲那裏人的一種風氣，也可說是一班人每天生活中必不可少的開支。雖你是個不大酷愛飲茶的人，只要在那裏住上三五個星期，保你會漸漸地被他們同在而上了癮的。</p>
<p>茶樓的這麽普遍，飲茶的人這麽多，在一個不曉得廣州實情的人的想像中，必以爲那裏的人的生活，是多麽的舒適的；但，其實際情形，恰不像所想像中的那樣美麗，茶樓的林立和飲客的衆多，不過只足以表露出那裏人的生活的無聊和枯燥而已。因爲一班没有正當職業，而又没有大量金錢的人，看（光陰）這東西，實是一文不値，甚且還若於捱過；旣覺獨自困守在寄所裏痛苦，又没有較多的錢到各大娱樂塲尋開心，只好選擇上茶樓這一道，邀集三二知友來談談天，飲飲茶，把悶人的歲月消磨過去了。並且，廣州的茶樓的設備，也好像是專爲這種人而設似的。無論那一間茶樓的門口，都必有一攤出租各種大小報的攤子；每一間茶樓的座位，都是多到令人數也數不淸，不管你是在那裏坐了多少個鐘頭，老板也總不會顯露出逐客的顏色來；有些更在客座的中間，特設一個臺座，聘請一二位女伶，一隊樂隊，在上面淸唱和彈奏，以供飲客們歡賞。只要花個一二毛錢，租一二種報紙，呌一壼茶，一碟瓜子，　一碟點心，便能很悠間爽適地一邊喝茶，一邊剝瓜子，一邊閱報，一邊聽曲的度過一天了。這樣的生活，誰不樂過？</p>
<p>如果是個大𤍠天，那茶樓的生意，就更加的𤍠鬧了。因爲茶樓多是摩天大厦，空氣較爲凉爽，並且還有電風扇在不停地旋轉着。要不是嚢空如洗，誰個願禁固在矮小的寄所裏苦受着𤍠？</p>
<p>廣州的茶樓，說是没有一定職業的中產階級的大本營，並没有多大過錯處吧！因爲在那裏，佔最多數的，就是這種人。</p>

<p>四五個，赤着膊，脊背焦紅，腦袋四週掛滿汗珠，掛到頸根，肩膊，胸脯……那兒，挺粗的大繩扔在頸根邊，重重地，得嵌進肉去似的，火𤍠的太陽下，上橋啦，（拉啊！拉啊！）那在後面擋車梗的拼命喊，快要炸裂的喉嚨哪！前面的四五個又瞅了瞅眉頭，（拉死也就完了。）大家心兒裏怨恨，要吃飯，没法想。</p>
<p>一塌車鋼條，給太陽囇得火燙，鐵輪子壓住溶化的柏油橋面，給黏牢了不能動，把所有的力氣統用出來，旣乎把腦袋衝着地，條條筋絡都綳在皮外，短褲兒給汗染了個透濕。無軌電車緊跟在後面踏鈴，再後面還有一輛汽車，草綠色的車身，奶油色篷帳，鋼精備胎罩，三響啦叭，夏季最流行的跑車哪。</p>
<p>就那樣没關掉馬達停着，火𤍠的太陽照不到坐車人的身上，坐汽車的人多　福呵，在車子裏嚷着：</p>
<p>（幹嗎呀？前面車子儘停着不走！）是一個女人尖脆的聲音。</p>
<p>（大约又有什麽車子抛了錨。）是一個男子温柔的回答。</p>

<p>（晚上才風凉呢！）</p>
<p>套着白色手套的手抓住凡而盤，攤邊的草帽是美利堅式的，漿褶襯衫服貼貼地着胸脯，電影小生的風格哪，希佛來的笑容貼在他臉上，嘴角邊燒着濃郁的Ｃｈｅｓｔｆｉｅｌｄ。另一隻手伸在那女人的背後。</p>
<p>轉動着一對會說話的眼珠子。</p>
<p>疲倦地斜在司必靈皮坐墊，垂着一對二英寸長的耳墜子；</p>
<p>（Ｄａｒｌｉｎｇ，我們不會穿朝前去嗎！</p>
<p>馬路上薫進的𤍠氣受不了啊。）</p>
<p>像下屬接到上諭，凡而盤旋動的時候，汽車就打無軌電車身邊爬了過去。　　塌車的鐵輪子剛轉動啦，可是拉車拉在頂前的那個腦袋給汽車衝了個大窟窿嘖着紫紅的，𤍠的血，血，血，………在强烈的太陽下。</p>
<p>受傷的滾在橋半邊，没受傷的攔住汽車，把額上的汗揮進車廂，把粗黑的胳膊伸到他們臉前，（賠命！賠命！賠命！）</p>
<p>自然地把烟蒂兒扔了：（呌巡捕來說！）</p>
<p>打人堆裏擠進一個巡捕，在他臉上找不到驚異的表情，淡然地掏出一本日記册，（怎辦？同到行裏去，還是………？）</p>
<p>便掏出一張卡片（有什麽事來通知便了。）</p>
<p>（不過，先生要把受傷的送醫院才行。）</p>
<p>（那……還是請你設法吧，我們的時間可不能躭誤的。）</p>
<p>說着，馬達便在脚底下響起來，没给一句多少帶些慊意的話，開走啦。</p>
<p>巡捕把卡片夾進日記簿，雇輛人力車把受傷的送醫院，在火𤍠的陽光下。</p>
<p>没被撞傷的依舊要拉，車輪輾過柏油上紫色的血漬，（拉啊！拉啊！）瞅了瞅眉頭，（拉死了亦就完了。）大家心兒裏怨恨，要吃飯，没法想。</p>
<p>軍工路上，吹着夏晚的風，𤍠浪給吹退啦，浦江裏飄着幽閒的汽艇。</p>
<p>汽車，綠色車身，奶油篷帳，三響啦叭，套着白色手套的手抓住凡而盤，男的，掛着希佛來的笑容，女的，流蕩着會說話的眼珠子：</p>
<p>（Ｄａｒｌｉｎｇ，不會再開快點嗎？）</p>
<h3 id="c254">暑期的徬徨 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 布魯</p>
<p>據報載：北平今夏的各大學畢業，因不耐畢業以後的徬徨，最近組織了職業運動大同盟。這同盟的目的，約有兩點：（一）打倒失業；（二）間接的暗示高等敎育的應予改革。</p>
<p>在這普遍失業的情形之下，大學生的没有出路，似乎也是應有的現象。但我們稍加以檢視，則覺得這是有些滑稽。我們都知道，我國甚麽都落後，推求其故，缺乏人才是主要原因之一；我們又知道，在我國，讀書能到大學畢業的，都是一斑天之驕子，以人口來比例，據敎育部的統計，每萬人中僅佔一人；這是多末寳貴的數字，似乎社會是應該如何去利用這批有如鳳毛麟角的人才。而事實上，恰恰相反，一方面在喊没有人才，另一方面却人才失業，這種現象，不能不說是滑稽，不可理解。</p>
<p>爲甚麽會這樣矛盾呢。在這裏，我們不能不作如斯急迫的追問。</p>
<p>就學校說，不可否認的，現今中國的敎育制度，是造成少爺小姐的敎育制度，是完全離開現實社會的敎育制度，是消费的而非生產的敎育制度。由這種敎育制度所造就的畢業生，化費了幾年光陰，換到一紙文憑，價値祇產生於文憑上，而文憑不能就代表學識；以這樣的人才，在現階段的中國社會中，當然是没有担當任何職責的能力。可是，一部份需要眞實人才的社會，却仍然是有才難之嘆。</p>
<p>再就社會說吧，與資本主義下的市塲壟斷和獨佔一樣，任何一個機關，在某某主持之下，則整個機關的人員，便俱屬某某的夾袋中人物，祇須誼在同鄕，同學，同黨派，或是裙帶親，就都可以廣沾他的福蔭。反之，倘欲找一隻飯碗，不靠父兄的勢力，不靠阔人的推薦，不靠同鄕，同學，同黨派的援引，不靠裙帶的内助，祇是靠自己的眞實學問與訓練，那便是夢想。這是的確的情形，這社會的職業分配，是極不平均。</p>
<p>我們當然不能把大學畢業生的没出路，絶對的歸罪於那方面，但四顧中國目前的現實情形，這兩個現象，是同時表現於這個社會，誰都不能否認的。</p>
<p>這樣，北平的大學畢業生，組織這一同盟，在我們想，是認爲値得注意的一件事，至少，在他們把自己的問題由自己担當起來這一點上，表示充分的同情；對於他們提出的兩點目標，打倒失業，當然是大學畢業生的當前急務，而暗示高等敎育的應予改革，爲中國的將來着想，更是重要！</p>
<h3 id="c255">小燕的悲哀 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 𠆩仃</p>
<p>時光彷佛閃電似的流過去，小燕自從買進張家以來，足足有十八個年頭了。</p>
<p>她，從娘始的肚裏落地以至離開了家，這期間，也不過三十六個足月而已。</p>
<p>所以，關於她家的事和自己的身世，小燕委實知道很少，時間於她是那麽短促啊，她可能知道什麽？</p>
<p>不過在她的腦裏，還影着這麽一個糢糊的印像：</p>
<p>在田野的大地上，靠着南方那邊，不是有簇綠色深深的叢林嗎？就在這叢林裏面，不是有幾間矮矮的破落的茅舍嗎？那間門前有幾顆松樹，這就是她的家。</p>
<p>爹的面孔到底是怎樣？她可認不得淸楚，但有個大約四十來歲光景的人，滿面鬍子，頭髮生得怪長，在頭上打了個盤辫子，臉是扁的，顏色是外黃發黑</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>，像老年的橙皮那般，眼睛是凹進去，没有點兒光彩，牙齒又髒又黃，口裏常常噴出上種悶人的氣味。個子不高，但也不算是矮，身上老穿着這麽一件破黑布襖。說話嗓子很重，好喝酒，常常鬧事，看來似乎很兇，但實際上並不是那樣。</p>
<p>另外一個女人，終日愁面苦臉的，這便是她的媽。</p>
<p>娘對她的印像比較深，而她對娘似乎也有了一種特别的感情。在她的身上，她往往嗅出一種母親那種慈母的氣味。她愛娘，喜歡娘，因爲娘是直接養活了她，那麽痛她，關心她，撫慰她。</p>
<p>直到現在，她彷彿仍舊記得娘的面孔，娘的聲音，和娘時常向她唱着好些歌子。她永遠不會忘記娘，小燕覺得娘是好的，娘是多麽可愛呀！</p>
<p>可是，這只是一個依稀的印像而已在她，小燕那麽年紀輕輕的時候，丨丨丨丨在母親的嘴邊拾得一些牙慧的時候，也是她家鄕慘遭災難的時候，爹娘爲了支撑他們兩條老命，爲了淸還那些永遠還不淸的債孽，於是他們就不得不把這一個他們唯一僅有的財產丨丨小燕，賣給鎭上張家去了。</p>
<p>從這些時起，他們始終和艱難困苦的日子掙扎着。而小燕也在這時在張家較爲優裕的生活環境之下漸漸的長大起來。起初，在她還没有懂得人世的時候，小燕像隻小鳥，没有拘覊，在自由的天空裏翔來翔去，張家的主人很愛她，已經成人了，她比小孩的時節長得更好看，曉得事更多。</p>
<p>煩惱和不幸於是漸漸的漸漸的一天迫近她一大。</p>
<p>女主人對她起最　一種極大的妬嫉心，於是便特别虐待她，糟蹋她，日夜令她過着一種比牛馬更甚的生活。而張老爺呢，對她早已有了一副野心，所以在太太的背後，特别向她親近，花言蜜語，成脅引誘，無所不用他的技兩。</p>
<p>此刻，她正和痛苦戰爭着，從老婆媽的口中，知道了張家是怎樣一種人，知道了她的身勢，知道了她未來那可怕的命運。於是想起她的那樣的家，想起她爲飢寒交迫而出賣了他們兒女的爹娘，和她，目前自己所陷的境遇，不覺深深的打了寒噤。她决心想私逃，但逃到那兒去呢？她嚋躇着，疑惑着。家是没有了，爹媽死活不知，她與他們也許已經認不得了。</p>

<p>昨晚，我夢見了死去的母親，和活着一樣，臉上露着慈祥的笑容。</p>
<p>立刻，我好像知道我在夢裏似的，我好像知道這夢不久就要醒似的，我把我的身體投入她的懷裏。我像一個小孩子，仰着頭坐着她底臉，右手的食指啣在唇間，我快樂地呌着（嗎）！</p>
<p>母親用手撫着我的頭髮，低微温柔的熟悉的催眠曲又在耳邊盪揚。</p>
<p>（媽，我要永遠在你的懷裏，受你甜蜜的歌聲音催眠；看你那慈祥的笑容。媽，我們永遠不要分離！）</p>
<p>母親微笑着，不響。</p>
<p>（媽，弟弟長大了，妹妹也會跳會跑，了都是怪可愛的。媽，你知道麽？）</p>
<p>母親依舊笑着，没回答。</p>
<p>（媽，我有了愛人哩！她是美麗的一位姑娘。也會笑，也會唱。她有烏黑的頭髮，光亮的眼睛呢！媽，你歡喜不？）</p>
<p>母親笑着點點頭。</p>
<p>我低了頭想一想，我在想些快樂的材料向母親報吿。我的心中充滿快樂，我的喉口也塡滿了言語。但，我說不出　　我笑着不響了！我望着母親，母親也望着我。眞的，我們幾曾分離過！母親不依舊那樣慈祥的笑着嗎？</p>

<p>回今的市塲上，正在大賣死人頭，我們不必舉例，祇要在（死）的新聞之後留意着，那死人頭在最迅速的旋率中已搬上市塲。一則使顧客們腦海中尙存留着着這死人頭是最新式的時候投機取巧，再則死人頭個個會賣，各有快慢不同的先下手爲强主義，靠死人發財，正是市面不景氣中的終南捷徑。然而賣買的是（空頭，）我曾夢想過如其眞的把這死人頭搬上市塲，那盛况更可想見，可惜變法戲的人没有這能力而已。　　因爲是長衫同志，終得維持長衫的尊嚴，如果赤裸裸的賣起死人頭來，豈不坍盡了長衫同志的台？，所以這筆好賣買被另一階級的短衫同志効法了，掘起人家的袓墳來。</p>

<p>不過此風一開，許多有身價的祖墳，不能築在山明水秀的龍股之地了，這豈不於匪人以使嗎？，應該卽日喬遷於租界𤍠鬧之區，築高墻，建大厦，僱阿大，豢警犬，以防死人骨頭之被盜！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Opening of Through Train Service Between Peiping and Mukden: Japanese Guards Withdrawing from Train; Trial Period Ends Yesterday; After Negotiations Between Yin Tong and Japanese Side, We Are Fully Responsible for the Section Within the Pass <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Peiping) Regarding the issue of Japanese guards accompanying the Peiping-Mukden through train, the agreed trial period ended yesterday. Yin Tong negotiated with Staff Officer Kikuchi of the Japanese Garrison Headquarters in Tientsin. Simultaneously, due to the arrival of Japanese Commander Umezu in Peiping, the Political Readjustment Committee specially dispatched Liu Shi-sun to negotiate with him. Umezu agreed to withdraw the guards as scheduled, and yesterday notified the Japanese Garrison. Today, the Peiping-Mukden through train departing from Peiping will not have Japanese guards. The Peiping-Mukden train arriving in Peiping today departed from Mukden the day before yesterday. The Japanese guards on the train disembarked at Tanggu upon receiving orders from the Japanese military authorities. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) Starting today, the withdrawal of Japanese guards from the Peiping-Mukden through train will be implemented. The safety of passengers on the section within the Pass will be the full responsibility of the Peiping-Mukden Railway Bureau. The bureau has today ordered all railway police along the line to strictly inspect passengers boarding the through train after they purchase their tickets before allowing them to pass. A supervisor and ten policemen are assigned to each train to observe passengers with suspicious behavior and conduct inspections at any time. This afternoon at 4:00 PM, Yin Tong visited Japanese Commander Umezu stationed in Tientsin to discuss the safety of passengers on the through train, exchanging many opinions. Yin originally intended to take the train to Peiping tonight to meet with Shibayama, but was unable to do so due to circumstances. He plans to go on the 10th. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After Yin Tong negotiated with Shibayama yesterday, the Japanese guards on the Peiping-Mukden train have been withdrawn from the 8th. We are fully responsible for the section within the Pass. (Eighth Dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) The Oriental Travel Agency established in Shanhaikuan was finally organized by the 8th. It is divided into four departments, each with two Chinese and Japanese section chiefs. There are thirty-seven staff members, sixteen Chinese and twenty-one Japanese. Most of the Japanese staff are transferred from the South Manchuria Railway and the International Tourist Bureau. Each time the through train passes through Shanhaikuan, the travel agency sends personnel to the station to assist. There is also an information desk set up inside the station to provide passengers with information. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Regarding the withdrawal of Japanese guards from the Peiping-Mukden through train, which is due today, the original agreement was for a one-week period. Whether they will withdraw as agreed tomorrow, according to the Japanese side, the original agreement for Japanese guards accompanying the train was for one week. If no accidents occur during this period, they will be abolished immediately. However, because incidents endangering trains have occurred frequently between Tanggu and Tangshan, there are currently no preparations for withdrawal. This morning, the Japanese guards on the Peiping-Mukden trains departing from and arriving in Peiping carried three light machine guns. It is reported that Yin Tong contacted Japanese military official Shibayama by long-distance telephone from Tientsin this afternoon to negotiate. (Full Day Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Oriental Travel Agency in Shanhaikuan has been doing good business recently. The agency's address has now been renovated. In addition to the Japanese Deputy Manager Hirayama, there are also several Japanese employees, including Kojima. These Japanese all reside at the Donghai Hotel in Shanhaikuan. The signboard of the Oriental Travel Agency was written by Yuan Tai, the magistrate of Linyu County. (Seventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to postal officials, since the opening of the Peiping-Mukden through train, the number of letters transmitted by China Post through Shanhaikuan to the South Manchuria Railway area outside the Pass has increased by a quarter, averaging more than 35,000 pieces per day. More than 20,000 pieces are also imported into the interior. They are transported from the Peiping-Mukden train to Tientsin and Peiping, where they are received by the Chinese Post Office. Most of the stamps affixed to the letters are Japanese stamps. Many postal items are also unloaded at Shanhaikuan. The losses currently incurred by China amount to several hundred thousand yuan per month. Transmitting mail to Europe and America via sea routes or via Vladivostok through Siberia is very slow. If postal services are to be resumed, the first step is to restore international postal schedules and handle postal money orders between the Northeast and the interior. Due to the complexity of the procedures, this will not be done for the time being. Regarding the establishment of tax checkpoints at the Great Wall, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Tientsin Customs to handle it. Chilton, the British tax commissioner of Qinhuangdao, is currently in contact with Igi, the chief of the Kwantung Army Shanhaikuan Special Affairs Agency. It is expected that it will be established at the beginning of next month. Zhang Yongnian, the deputy tax commissioner dispatched by the Ministry of Finance for inspection, is currently investigating in Qinhuangdao and Shanhaikuan. (Seventh Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">National Mining, Metallurgy, and Geology Exhibition Opens Yesterday; More Than 50,000 Items on Display; Thirty-One Pavilions Open Simultaneously; Chen Gongbo Arrives in Tientsin to Attend Opening Ceremony <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Tientsin) The Mining, Metallurgy, and Geology Exhibition opened at 9:00 AM this morning. Chairman Chen Gongbo, along with more than 600 people from all walks of life and representatives from academic institutions, attended. After Chen finished his report, Wang Zhengting delivered a speech on behalf of the Central Government, urging the people to cooperate in mining. Yu Xuezhong, representing the Hebei Education Department, and Zhou Binglin, representing others, also gave speeches. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. Telegrams of congratulations from Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and various ministers were received today and read aloud by Li Shutian, the chief executive of the exhibition. Afterwards, photographs were taken and the exhibition was visited for a week before dispersing. A total of more than 50,000 items are on display at the Mining Exhibition. Products from famous mines in the country have been collected, and foreign countries such as Germany, Sweden, Britain, and the United States have also sent products for display. They are divided into thirty-one pavilions. It has been open to the public since 2:00 PM this afternoon. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) Chen Gongbo reported at the Mining Exhibition, stating: 1. China's coal reserves are 248 million tons, ranking third in the world. Coal mines with permits for mining total 11 million hectares, while other non-metallic mining areas total 1.8 million hectares. Therefore, coal mines account for 86% of the mining area. Before the September 18th Incident, the annual output was more than 20 million tons. Last year, due to the loss of 7 million tons of output in the Northeast, it was slightly worse. The domestic consumption is 20 million tons per year, so imports exceeded 1.3 million tons last year. 2. China's steel industry ranks ninth in the world, with a domestic annual output of 2,300 tons, necessitating the supplementation of foreign steel. The annual value of imports exceeds 70-80 million yuan. Today, people from the industrial and financial sectors are here, hoping to make efforts to assist the industrial sector to develop. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) Chen Gongbo arrived in Tientsin at 4:20 AM this morning and is staying at the Empress Hotel. He is here only to attend the opening ceremony of the Mining Exhibition and has no other business. He is scheduled to return to Nanjing by train on the evening of the 9th. This morning, Wang Zhengting arrived in Tientsin on behalf of the Central Party Department to attend the Mining Exhibition. Chen Gongbo said that the Ministry of Industry's ten-year national industrial plan is being drafted and cannot be announced until it becomes a reality. However, China is different from the Soviet Union, and the implementation of the plan cannot be forcibly imitated. Regarding the construction of a steel plant, the procedures have some minor problems and are being discussed with the British. It will be realized soon. This afternoon at 4:00 PM, Chen broadcast news about the Mining Exhibition. To facilitate visitors, the Mining Exhibition has agreed with the Peiping-Mukden Railway and the municipal government to add special train and bus services to Xigu every day, with very low fares, until the closing day.

<h3 id="e4">Judicial Yuan Interprets Legal Provisions <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan has unified the interpretation of laws and regulations regarding the authority of the head of the household over property and various doubts about establishing an heir. (1) The head of the household manages household affairs and, for the benefit of the entire family, may dispose of family property. However, property that has already been inherited by family members or that belongs to them requires the consent of the family members. (2) Before the implementation of the inheritance section of the Civil Code, a widow who remained chaste could establish an heir for her husband. According to the laws at the time, she should obtain the consent of the direct ascendants of her husband. If consent was not sought in advance, her ascendants could request revocation. However, they could still supplement by seeking consent later. If they disagree without legitimate reasons, a judgment may be used to replace it. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Tao Shangming Visits Shibayama to Continue Discussions on War Zone Issues; Replacement of the New Peace Preservation Corps to be Discussed After Huang Returns North; Japanese Side Decides to Ban Activities of Japanese and Korean Rōnin in Various Counties; Japanese Side Gives No Definite Indication Regarding the Transfer of Malanyu; Decision to Expand the Organization of the Committee for the Preservation of Eastern Tombs <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Peiping) Regarding the unresolved issues of the war zone, Tao Shangming came to Peiping after the implementation of the Peiping-Mukden through train to repeatedly meet with Yin Rugeng for negotiations and to negotiate with the Japanese side. However, there have been no concrete results. Tao visited Shibayama today to continue discussing these issues. 1. Regarding the replacement of the New Peace Preservation Corps, the Japanese side stated that the situation is complicated and not easy to resolve in a short time. It needs to be discussed further after Huang returns north. 2. Regarding the activities of Japanese and Korean Rōnin in various counties, Tanaka, the deputy consul of Japan in Tianjin, had previously gone to investigate with Kang Xuan, a consultant to the Jiji Mi Special Commissioner's Office, and had already taken measures to ban them. Recently, the Japanese consul notified our side that in the future, whether Japanese or Koreans come to the war zone to do business or travel, they must obtain a certificate from the Japanese consulate in Tianjin before they can enter. The Chinese side can protect them according to the law. If Japanese or Koreans enter the war zone without a consular certificate, the Chinese side can deport them. 3. Regarding the Malanyu issue, because the Japanese side has not yet given a definite indication of the transfer, the handover date has not yet been decided. Due to the recent heavy rains, the roads are difficult to travel, and Yin Tixin has postponed his trip. He will proceed as soon as he receives a definite reply from the Japanese side. 4. Regarding the preservation of the Eastern Tombs, it has been decided to expand the organization of the Preservation Committee, designating Wei Jian, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Hebei Province, Lin Chengxiu, Director of the Department of Industry, Yin Rugeng, Jiji Mi Special Commissioner, Li Chao, Magistrate of Xinglong County, Yin Tixin, Director of the Malanyu Office, and six representatives of the deposed Qing imperial family as ex officio members, with Yin Rugeng serving as chairman. Bao Ming was originally a representative of the Qing imperial family, but due to his old age, it has been decided to select someone else to participate, with Zaitao being the most promising candidate. Our side is responsible for the preservation rights and repair of the Eastern Tombs to restore the historical sites, but the deposed Qing imperial family can freely pay tribute to the Eastern Tombs. (Eighth)</p>
<p>(Peiping) At the Sino-Japanese representatives' meeting in Shanhaikuan, it was agreed that the unresolved issues in the war zone would be gradually discussed and resolved after the Peiping-Mukden through train was opened. Now that the through train has been implemented, Tao Shangming and Yin Rugeng have repeatedly met to discuss the steps for negotiations in the war zone and telegraphed Huang for instructions, preparing to conduct overall negotiations with the Japanese side. However, the Tanggu Truce Agreement is a kind of temporary military condition mutually respected. After all the post-war matters are resolved, it will lose its effect. Up to this year, we have completed everything that we should have fulfilled, but the Japanese army is entrenched inside the Great Wall line and has not complied with the agreement to withdraw from nine places: Jiumenkou, Luanxian, Lengkou, Taitouying, Jianchangying, Cuoheqiao, Xifengkou, Malanyu, and Gubeikou. Each place has 40-50 to 300-400 Japanese troops stationed there. The issue of the existence and abolition of the truce agreement is of great importance. All unresolved issues can only be concretely advanced after Huang returns north. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) It has been decided that Malanyu will be handed over on the 18th. Yin Rugeng met with Tao Shangming today to discuss matters. He will go to Malanyu on the 15th to participate in the handover ceremony. The issue of expanding the Malanyu Preservation Committee is currently being discussed by the provincial government, the Jiji Mi Commissioner's Office, the Xinglong County Government, and the deposed Qing princes. It can be established in the short term. (Seventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The pseudo-organization in Jixian County plans to repair the original long walls of the Eastern Tombs, restoring them to their original state. They have sent many people to measure the border walls, which are thirty li long. The construction costs require 600,000 yuan. The pseudo-organization has suspended the project because the required funds are too large. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Xu Yongchang, Chairman of Shanxi Province, accompanied by Yang Aiyuan, commander of the army, Jing Yuexiu, commander of the division, and more than 20 secretaries, arrived in Nanjing by Gonghe boat from Wuhan on the afternoon of the 8th.

Li Hongwen, representative of the Shanxi Provincial Government in Nanjing, Wang Yongbin, Chairman of the Examination Committee, and all the staff of the Shanxi Provincial Government's office in Nanjing, totaling more than 20 people, went to the Jiangbian Wharf to greet them.

After completing their affairs in Nanjing, they will go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for instructions. (Eighth Dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, Jing Yuexiu, and several members of their entourage arrived in Nanjing on the Jianghe ship at around 11:00 AM on the 8th. After arriving at the hotel, they visited friends in the afternoon. They plan to visit the mausoleum on the morning of the 9th. Yang Aiyuan, on behalf of Xu, told reporters that we have not met with the central authorities for a long time, so we came to Nanjing to receive instructions and report on the military and political situation in Shanxi Province. We plan to stay in Nanjing for three or four days. After reporting to the officials, we will go to Xunyang to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The recent situation in Shanxi Province that can be reported is as follows: (1) In terms of military affairs, due to the lack of military spending, the army has been reduced. The original infantry, cavalry, and artillery in Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces totaled nine divisions, but they were based on a four-company system. Now, after the reorganization conference, it has been decided to reduce one company per battalion and adopt a three-three system. 20,000-30,000 officers and soldiers have been reduced, saving 200,000 yuan in salaries. The reorganization will be completed before August 1st and the new system will be implemented. The officers and soldiers who were laid off this time will be given one month's severance pay. (2) In terms of politics and government, due to financial difficulties, new policies cannot be implemented. The province's income, including national taxes allocated by the central government, totals about one million yuan per month, which is only enough to maintain government expenses. All construction is unlikely to be carried out. Only the Datong-Puzhou Railway is being actively built. The Jiexiu section has been opened to traffic. By the end of the year, two-thirds of the entire line may be completed, and the entire line will be completed by the spring of next year. (Eighth Dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Person in Charge of Ministry of Finance Speaks on New Tariff <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Tax Reduction on Cloth Has Little Impact on Domestic Textile Industry; Paper Relies on Foreign Supply, Tax Reduction Is to Take Care of Consumption; Hope Domestic Merchants Strive to Improve to Reduce Production Costs</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The person in charge of the Ministry of Finance gave a statement on the new import tariffs implemented by the Customs on the 8th. He said that the tariffs should be revised after a considerable period of implementation to suit the national conditions. As for the contents of the new tariffs, the tax reduction on cotton fabrics is limited to printed and yarn-dyed fabrics. This is not the main product of China's textile industry. Except for slight changes in Western satin damask cotton flannelette, there are no increases or decreases in the two major categories of plain and bleached cotton fabrics, which are produced the most domestically. It can be seen that the tax reduction on cloth in the new tariff has little impact on the domestic textile industry. The tax reduction on paper is the suggestion of the competent cultural authorities because paper for printing books still relies on foreign supply. The tax reduction is to take care of consumption. As for the tariff rate on fish and seafood products, there have been changes. For example, due to the strong request from overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Macau, the tax on salted fish had to be reduced slightly. The tax on fish and seafood similar to salted fish has also been reduced, but the tax rate is still above 20% ad valorem. The import tax on cotton has been increased to maintain the rural economy. The tax rate on machinery is mostly 5% ad valorem, which was originally low. Now, a slight increase will not hinder construction. Taxes have been increased on pig iron, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, calcium carbonate, iron wire yarn, rubber products, wood chips, wood shavings, tiles, porcelain, etc., which provide considerable protection for the domestic iron smelting, chemical, and match industries. It is hoped that Chinese canning factories will strive to improve technology and management to reduce production costs and compete with foreign merchants. (Eighth Dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance explained the tariff and responded to the opinions of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and various groups requesting the cancellation of the tariff rules that had been set. It believes that the Ministry of Finance's feelings regarding this amendment to the import tariff are different from the views of the business community, which proves that the Ministry of Finance has no intention of revising it at this time.

<h3 id="e16">French Foreign Policy and Barthou's Trip to Eastern Europe <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>France, as the protagonist of the Versailles system, has always held a commanding and freely manipulative position on the European continent. However, since the rise of Hitler, feeling the "brown danger," it has been concerned that the Versailles system might be shaken. Furthermore, in the past half-year, the relationship between Italy and Austria-Hungary has become increasingly close, making it impossible to realize the Danube Plan, which France has been working on for a long time. Recently, seeing Hitler and Mussolini meet in Venice, it fears that the Versailles system will be hit before the two enemies join hands.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Britain, separated from the European continent by a narrow strip of water, although also relying on the Versailles system for survival, has ignored France's exclusive control of hegemony for fifteen years. Therefore, it often adopts a policy of supporting Germany and restraining France, shuttling between Berlin and Paris. Britain's bias has further plunged France into encirclement. The verbal battle between British and French representatives at the Geneva Disarmament Conference in early June is proof that the contradictions between Britain and France are more tense than before. From this point of view, it seems that the difficulties of French diplomacy have never been as great as they are today in the past decade.</p>
<p>In the world, only when things become difficult do they change, and only through change can they become smooth. Since France ratified the Franco-Soviet non-aggression treaty, it has not only abandoned its traditional anti-Soviet movement, but also further strengthened friendly relations with the Soviet Union, thereby maintaining a new balance of power on the European continent. The flexibility of French diplomacy can be seen from this. Due to the improvement of Franco-Soviet relations, the satellite states of the Little Entente and Poland, under the leadership of France, have also successively reconciled with the Soviet Union. The so-called multilateral convention containing the definition of aggressor, signed by the Little Entente and Poland last July, and the simultaneous restoration of diplomatic relations between Romania and Czechoslovakia with the Soviet Union in June this year, are clearly new gains after the change in French foreign policy. With these new gains, the threats France faces on the European continent have naturally been reduced.</p>
<p>However, from another perspective, it seems that the satellites under the leadership of France are also showing a slight tendency to drift away. For example, Poland's closeness to Germany is one of the facts. Therefore, the current foreign policy of France, in addition to attracting the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations to strengthen its support, only has to exert its diplomatic skills to make the satellites more united around the Versailles system in order to confront the anti-Versailles system front in Europe. Barthou's previous visits to Warsaw and Prague were concrete manifestations of the aforementioned foreign policy. Recently, Barthou revisited Eastern Europe on June 18, first going to Romania, then to Yugoslavia, and returning to Paris on the 27th. His hot and dusty journey was nothing more than an attempt to use his eloquent tongue to step up the unity of the existing forces of the Versailles system in order to break through the difficulties of French diplomacy.</p>
<p>It is said that when Barthou's car entered Romanian territory and arrived in a city, residents in full dress came to the station to welcome him warmly, and even the Senate and House of Representatives declared Barthou an "Honorary Citizen of Romania." The welcome he received in Yugoslavia was no less warm than in Romania. We certainly do not believe what Parisian newspapers claim, "The French Foreign Minister conquered Romania in twenty-four hours." However, it can be confidently said that Barthou's trip can make the two satellites stand on the same front with France. At a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French Chamber of Deputies on the 6th of this month, Barthou declared that the main purpose of French diplomacy is based on the principle of "seeking peace anytime, anywhere." What is peace? In Barthou's mind, it is nothing more than maintaining the balance of power under the Versailles system.</p>
<p>If French diplomacy really goes one step further, then the forces against the Versailles system will naturally "rise with the tide." The Hungarian demonstrations sparked by Barthou's declaration against amending the peace treaty are just one example. Is the diplomatic war of intrigue perhaps the means that must be adopted on the eve of armed conflict?</p>
<h3 id="e17">Okada Cabinet's Six Policies: Thoroughly Rectify Discipline, Actively Prepare for a Major War and the Russo-Japanese War, Similar to the Nature of the Former Katsura Cabinet, Poor Atmosphere in the Diet, Life Expectancy Likely to Be Short <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Okada Cabinet, due to a dispute with the Seiyukai, only completed its organization this morning. In the next Diet session, it is inevitable that it will clash head-on with the Seiyukai, but the Seiyukai itself will definitely split in the near future, so its power is not to be feared. It is rumored that the new cabinet's policy guidelines are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Thoroughly rectify discipline and eliminate corruption in the central and local governments. This is the purpose of appointing Ohara as Minister of Justice and Goto as Minister of Interior.</p>
<p>(2) Expand the army and navy and prepare for World War II. The nature of this cabinet is similar to that of the first Katsura Cabinet before the Russo-Japanese War. Before the Katsura Cabinet, the elder statesmen took turns forming cabinets, so the Katsura Cabinet was called a third-rate cabinet. Komura was in charge of foreign affairs, and Terauchi and Yamamoto, the mainstays of the army and navy, were appointed as Ministers of the Army and Navy. Okada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hirota, is the successor to Komura's diplomacy, and Osumi and Hayashi are also central figures in the military. Therefore, the purpose is to prepare for war. (3) Consolidate finances and administration and change to a wartime organization.</p>
<p>(4) Implement a colonial policy in China. The Prime Minister concurrently serves as Minister of Colonial Affairs in order to reform the system at any time.</p>
<p>(5) Solve the rural problem, eliminate domestic unrest, and guard against domestic revolution.</p>
<p>(6) Implement a tough policy and carry out diplomacy of cooperation with all nations with the determination to not hesitate to fight a war. (8th United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The atmosphere in the Diet is that the Okada Cabinet disregards the Diet and combines with political parties and bureaucrats to form a cabinet that touts discipline rectification, but whether the selection of personnel can meet this point is highly questionable, so the evaluation is not good. The only hope is that Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Goto will seek fairness in elections, but there is also a risk of stopping halfway. Considering these things, the Okada Cabinet is likely to be unexpectedly short-lived. (8th Special Dispatch Telegraph)</p>

At 10:20, the Emperor's Appointment Ceremony for Prime Minister Okada was held first. Then, at 11:00, with Prime Minister Okada standing by, the Emperor's Appointment Ceremony for each cabinet member was held. The list of new cabinet members is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada Keisuke (Admiral of the Navy), Minister of Interior Goto Fumio (Former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry), Minister of Foreign Affairs Hirota Koki (Reappointed), Minister of the Army Hayashi Senjuro (Reappointed), Minister of the Navy Osumi Mineo (Reappointed), Minister of Finance Fujii Masanobu (Former Vice Minister of Finance), Minister of Justice Ohara Nao (Chief Judge of the Tokyo High Court), Minister of Education Matsuda Genji (Minseito), Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Yamazaki Tatsunosuke (Seiyukai), Minister of Commerce and Industry Machida Chuji (Minseito), Minister of Communications Tokonami Takejiro (Seiyukai), Minister of Railways Uchida Shinyai (Seiyukai), Minister of Colonial Affairs Okada Keisuke (Concurrently), Chief Cabinet Secretary Kawada Isao (Vice Minister of Colonial Affairs) (8th China Press)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) At 12:15 p.m. today, the Okada new cabinet held its first cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence. All cabinet members, including Prime Minister Okada, attended. The Prime Minister said in his address that he had received the great order to take charge of national affairs and hoped for the assistance of everyone. He intended to implement fair and bright politics based on the constitution, and especially to strive for the rectification of discipline. Then, after deciding on the following two items, the meeting ended at 12:45 p.m., and everyone raised champagne to celebrate the establishment of the cabinet.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) After the first meeting on the 8th adjourned, Foreign Minister Hirota spoke about his aspirations regarding foreign policy as follows:</p>
<p>I will continue to do my best to follow the policy of cooperative diplomacy decided by the Five-Province Conference and will never change its purpose. Now that both domestic and foreign affairs are in a serious situation, I have been reappointed as Foreign Minister, and the responsibility is heavy, needless to say. As for the relationship between Japan and the United States, a general understanding has already been reached when Hull and Hirota exchanged notes, so the friendly relationship between Japan and the United States is no longer a time for talk, but has already entered a practical stage. I plan to wait for Ambassador Saito (Japanese Ambassador to the United States) to return home to hear the detailed situation and then study it. As for Sino-Japanese relations, they have gradually improved, which is a factual proof, so the policy toward China must still follow the previous policy. The recent problems in Japan-Soviet relations are expected to be resolved soon, but the Manchurian problem is the most important problem facing Japan today. Therefore, the people must do their best to devote all their efforts to it in order to make progress. In order to complete the Manchurian problem, Japan must bear the important parts of its manpower and financial resources and plan its progress with this awareness. Now the world is in a state of panic in both political and economic terms. If we want to overcome this phenomenon, it is impossible without the joint efforts of the great powers. If the great powers can feel their responsibility to maintain peace at this time and understand each other, then the seeds of the world's turmoil can be extinguished. Next year's naval conference can be said to be the greatest opportunity to achieve this goal. (8th United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Hirota's reappointment is conditional on continuing to maintain the national defense and diplomatic policies decided by the previous cabinet's Five-Minister Conference. Now, in order to make it more concrete, he has proposed to Prime Minister Okada that the Five-Minister Conference of Okada, Hirota, Hayashi, Osumi, and Fujii be convened as soon as possible to discuss general national defense and diplomatic policies and fundamental countermeasures for the disarmament conference. (8th Dentsu Telegraph)</p>
<h3 id="e21">Prime Minister Okada Complies with the Wishes of the Military, Striving to Realize All So-Called National Defense Policies <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Hayashi's statement is as follows: It is rumored that the condition for my reappointment is to recognize the army's national defense policy, but it is not as serious as the rumors. I have fully explained my thoughts to the Prime Minister and established a considerable understanding, which is a fact. (8th Dentsu Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The army's observation of the new cabinet is that it is appropriate to establish a cabinet of this extent in light of the current situation and hopes that the Okada new cabinet will move forward based on policy. Also, Prime Minister Okada has recognized the army's important national policies, so there is considerable confidence in its implementation. Furthermore, it is determined to fully request Prime Minister Okada in the future, that is, national defense policies such as strengthening military preparations and resolving policies toward Manchuria. Especially for the latter, it wants to make the Kwantung Office a local office, change it from a three-in-one to a two-in-one based on the traditional system, establish an organization to supervise the South Manchuria Railway and other companies in Manchuria under the jurisdiction of the Ambassador Plenipotentiary, and plan to abolish the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, which is an obstacle. Also, when Minister of the Army Hayashi was reappointed, he obtained Prime Minister Okada's consent to the implementation of such policies, so its premise was that the Prime Minister concurrently served as Minister of Colonial Affairs at the time of this cabinet formation.

<p>(Tokyo) Today, Minister of Finance Fujii stated his aspirations regarding future financial and economic policies. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In principle, financial and economic policies will follow the policies of former Minister of Finance Takahashi. (1) Financial management aims to reduce public bonds and save expenditures in order to achieve a balance of accounts. However, the current internal and external situation requires considerable facilities for national defense costs and others, so it will be difficult to rapidly establish finances in the future. (1) Therefore, increasing taxes is felt to be necessary, but the timing and methods of implementation must be carefully studied. That is, the harmonization of national defense, diplomacy, and finance will be carried out in the same way as the policy of the previous cabinet. (8th Dentsu Telegraph)</p>
<h3 id="e23">Rumor That the Ministry of Colonial Affairs Will Be Abolished, One Saying That Konoe Will Be Appointed Minister of Colonial Affairs <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The rumor of the abolition of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has been very strong recently. The Okada new Prime Minister has repeatedly denied it, but he has not recommended another suitable person to serve as Minister of Colonial Affairs. Okada himself concurrently serves, but the political world expects that it will be abolished in the future. The reasons are as follows: (1) The military is in favor of abolition, believing that although the Ministry of Colonial Affairs claims to govern Taiwan, Korea, Sakhalin, the Kwantung Leased Territory, and the South Pacific Mandated Islands, these places can be governed by the Ministry of Interior, so abolishing a province can save administrative costs. (2) The immigration matters that the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has managed in the past, except for a part of South America, will focus on Manchuria in the future, so the immigration business must be managed by the military. (3) The Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway Company are currently managed by the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, but this matter must be managed by the Commander of the Kwantung Army in the future. (8th China Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The fact that the Prime Minister concurrently serves as Minister of Colonial Affairs is opposed by the military and foreign affairs due to the relationship with the policy toward Manchuria. It is a temporary concurrent appointment, and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs will be abolished at an appropriate time, but on the other hand, it is said that there is no understanding between the military and Prime Minister Oka regarding the abolition of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. It is because they want to appoint Prince Konoe Fumimaro, who is currently returning to the United States, as Minister of Colonial Affairs. It is said to be a temporary convenience.

<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai's executive officers will expel the members of the new cabinet who joined the cabinet, both cabinet ministers and parliamentary vice-ministers, after they leave the party, or they will be expelled if they do not leave the party. However, members of the Tokonami faction may not leave the party one after another and will temporarily remain in the party, taking a self-respecting attitude. However, their self-respecting attitude is not to observe the party quietly, but to wait for the surrounding situation to be favorable to them and then make a decision. Therefore, although it will not split on the surface for the time being, the crisis of the Seiyukai is slowly proceeding from within. (8th Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai opened a general affairs meeting at 9:00 this morning to discuss the disciplinary action against Tokonami Takejiro, Uchida Shinyai, and Yamazaki Tatsunosuke, who joined the Okada Cabinet. As a result, it was decided that the three individuals disregarded the party's resolutions and disrupted the party's rules and were resolutely punished with expulsion. The three individuals were immediately notified, and the Seiyukai has shown signs of division at this point. (8th Dentsu News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e34">German Incident Promotes Anglo-French Approach, Barthou Visits Britain for Political Talks, Will Explain the Eastern Locarno Plan, Naval Issues Will Also Be Discussed Simultaneously, Germans Uneasy <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(London) French Foreign Minister Barthou and Navy Minister Pietri, at the invitation of the British government, will come here together tomorrow. On Monday morning, Barthou Pietri and Foreign Secretary Simon will begin meeting at the Foreign Office. It will continue in the afternoon. Prime Minister MacDonald is on vacation due to an eye ailment. Acting Prime Minister Lord President Baldwin will host a luncheon for the French representatives. The procedures for the talks between the two countries will depend on how long Pietri stays in Britain. If he and Foreign Minister Barthou have to return to France at the same time, then naval issues and general European political issues will be discussed at the same time. If Barthou returns to France first, Pietri can stay for a few more hours, then Barthou's talks will be limited to discussing general political issues. British people want to know France's views on naval issues. The recent Italian plan to build a 35,000-ton battleship gives the United States a legitimate reason for its big ship policy, or at least an excuse to advocate big ships. This is well known in London. As for how French naval policy is affected by Italy's shipbuilding plan, it is not yet known. What Britain is waiting for from the French representatives is to understand this point. Tonight, political circles briefly explained the significance of Barthou's meeting with British authorities, that is, Barthou's visit to London is a major event politically, but it is not as important as the Labor opposition said that the two countries will sign some kind of agreement. In fact, this meeting shows that once new difficulties occur in Europe, Britain and France will consult each other and get closer. (7th Havas)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The newspapers are quite uneasy about French Foreign Minister Barthou's visit to Britain and are issuing warnings, saying that if France is allowed to do what it wants in Europe, it will have dangerous consequences. According to Parisian sources, Barthou's mission to London is to lecture rather than negotiate and believes that Barthou will explain his proposed Balkan Locarno Pact plan and the close understanding between France and Russia to Britain. (7th Reuters)</p>
<p>Vienna The Neue Freie Presse commented on the French Foreign Minister's visit to Britain, saying that Barthou's opinions differed from Simon's at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, and there was a slight sense of estrangement between the two countries. This visit by Barthou to London may be expected to be easily understood by the British. Even if Barthou's visit to Britain is not to restore the pre-war friendly consultations between the two countries, there is at least one thing that can be doubted, that is, among the members of the British Cabinet and the people close to the cabinet, the atmosphere of supporting rapprochement with France has become relatively strong. Although Britain has always been reluctant to have relations with the mainland, it has to slightly change its old ways today. The semi-official Federal Post believes that Germany's most important incident has created a favorable atmosphere for Barthou in London. The newspaper said, (The rapprochement between Paris and London can be counted on. If the rapprochement between the two countries is really achieved, then we cannot but attribute it to the German National Socialist Party authorities), etc. (8th Havas)</p>

At the same time, Conservative MP Churchill gave a speech in Wimbledon, which contradicted Chamberlain's words. Churchill said that Britain is in danger from Germany and should consult with France and other friendly countries to protect each other. Churchill also said that Britain needs to strengthen its air force. (8th Havas)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Vice-Chancellor Papen has gone to Neudeck, New York, to visit President Hindenburg to discuss the current political situation. Political circles in Berlin unanimously believe that Papen's move is of great importance. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since the coup of June 30th, it has been generally believed that the position of the Hitler government has been affected. On what basis Hitler will exercise dictatorship in the future is a question that political figures are speculating about. Since the leaders of the Sturmabteilung were executed, the members of the Sturmabteilung have felt deeply uneasy. In the past two days, the National Socialist Party (Nazi) authorities have tried various methods to restore the credibility of the Sturmabteilung. Lutz, who succeeded Röhm as Chief of Staff of the Sturmabteilung, was completely unknown before the incident. Hitler intentionally appointed a second-rate figure to this position precisely to indicate a reduction in the status of the Sturmabteilung. Hess, a Minister without Portfolio who handles party affairs for Hitler, issued a declaration to stabilize public sentiment, saying that Hitler has always trusted the Sturmabteilung. All newspapers published this declaration this morning. However, how Röhm plotted his betrayal was never mentioned. According to people familiar with the Sturmabteilung's psychology, the members of the Sturmabteilung are deeply lacking in material needs. What they hope from their deceased leaders is nothing more than to convey their plight to Hitler. They have no other ambitions. Today, German newspapers also mentioned the relationship between former Chancellor Schleicher and France. This kind of fact is unbelievable, but German newspapers repeatedly mention it. If it is true, it can also be seen that the internal affairs of Germany are difficult. The general public believes that the position of Propaganda Minister Goebbels is solid, but in reality, it is not so. Goebbels exchanged telegrams with the new Chief of Staff of the Sturmabteilung, Lutz, with extremely affectionate words. Goebbels told Lutz that he always adheres to the spirit of the Sturmabteilung. The two men's telegrams were fully published in today's newspapers. Goebbels recently fiercely attacked the military and former military officers in Essen. Today, Goebbels issued a correction, expressing his apology. As a result, the weight of his recent remarks has been greatly reduced. Also, Aviation Minister Göring once claimed that "his mission has been expanded," but military leaders do not seem to fully agree with Göring's expansion of his own mission. As for Vice-Chancellor Papen's speech at the University of Marburg, it is closely related to the cause of this coup, as everyone knows. Papen is determined to clear up the doubts that foreigners have about him. It is rumored that Papen will rely on President Hindenburg to seek a swift clarification of the situation, because Hindenburg is currently the only undeniable authority in Germany. Under the same thread, we must also pay attention to one thing: the death of former Chancellor and Defense Minister General Schleicher. According to the government gazette, he committed treason. This is what people are widely rumored. When Schleicher was buried, his friend, former Chief of Staff General Hammerstein, personally went to hold the rope. This is also a matter worthy of great attention. In short, although the outcome of the June 30th coup is not yet clear, according to those who pay attention to the situation, it will soon become clear. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e39">Artificial Rain: The Soviet Union's Rainmaking Bureau Successfully Experiments, But Its Cost is Not Very Economical <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian authorities' (Rainmaking Bureau), established last year in the cotton-growing area of Uzbekistan, which had previously reported a drought, today released its official report on its first artificial rain experiment. Professor Gitten, director of the bureau, claimed that during the field experiment, he produced torrential rain that fell on an area of ​​one and a half square kilometers for as long as forty-five minutes. The artificial rain was produced using chemical methods and dispersing a special gas to promote the condensation of moisture in the air. As a result, this prototype rain cloud was subjected to a strong electric current, which caused it to release rain. The report further stated that this experiment was indeed successful, but the cost of production is extremely uneconomical. (National News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Nagasaki: Northern Kyushu, centered on the three cities of Yawata, Tobata, and Wakamatsu, has reached the extreme of drought. The Yawata Iron Works, the heart of Japan's military industry, is forcing citizens to conserve water for the use of factories due to a lack of water. However, it is still insufficient. Some seawater has to be used. Factory executives have been holding meetings every day to find relief measures. Therefore, if there is no rain in the next ten days, the factory will inevitably have to stop work, and the citizens of the above-mentioned cities will also suffer from water shortages.

<p>(Washington) U.S. congressional elections will be held this autumn. The Republican Party has begun to attack the policies implemented by Roosevelt. Senator Lewis, a Democratic senator from Chicago and chairman of the Senate Elections Committee, stated yesterday that President Roosevelt wants to make domestic industrialists and other members of the public understand the purpose of the laws passed during the last congressional session during the election campaign. The President also hopes that the people will offer more opinions on the above-mentioned laws so that they can be revised to suit their wishes. It is rumored that before the President went on tour, he instructed his advisors to prepare to draft new laws, and these new laws will only be announced after the next election. Therefore, business people are uncertain about the application of current laws. The President's intention is to eliminate this kind of doubt. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e43">U.S.-Japan Trade Relations <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Tariff Commission, in its study of trade with Japan for the Senate, stated that U.S.-Japan commerce is very important to both countries, accounting for a large portion of each country's foreign trade. The study is intended to serve as a basis for future commercial negotiations between the two countries, stating that in 1928, Japan's exports to the United States accounted for 42% of its total, while U.S. exports to Japan accounted for 28%. In 1932, Japan's exports to the United States accounted for 32%, while U.S. exports to Japan accounted for 36%. This shows that during the economic downturn, the United States reduced its purchases from Japan, while Japan increased its imports from the United States. The United States has benefited from this situation. However, U.S. business circles have repeatedly requested the government to implement protection policies for certain Japanese goods. The Tariff Commission's research results are purely statistical and have no relation to these specific issues. Moreover, the items requested by the business community are only a small part of the goods. Matches are one of them. The United States has now levied a domestic tax on colored stem matches to enable them to compete fairly. Another item is pencils. A gentleman's agreement has been reached between Japan and the United States to limit Japan's pencil exports to the United States. Other items, such as tuna and clams, have also had their tariffs increased. There have also been many discussions about light bulbs and rubber shoes, but all of these are not the main items of trade between the two countries. The largest item is raw silk, which accounts for four-fifths of Japan's exports to the United States. U.S. imports of raw silk are exempt from tariffs, so Japanese goods accounted for 88% of imports in 1928 and 86% in 1932. However, Japan's raw silk exports to the United States were valued at US$31.8 million in 1928, but decreased to US$10.6 million in 1932. Other Japanese goods that are exempt from tariffs include tea and hides, but these have all decreased by 1932. Goods subject to tariffs include silk fabrics, porcelain, camphor, straw hats, and light bulbs. (National News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>

It is believed that this is because the customs branches at the various passes of the Great Wall are about to levy taxes, so the Japanese are actively transporting goods into the pass. More than a dozen Japanese shops have now been opened in Dongluocheng, each with warehouses for storing goods. To prevent tax evasion, the Jin-Dong-Yong-Qi Anti-Smuggling Bureau is now conducting strict inspections within its jurisdiction. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Wu Heling said that the 30,000 yuan in operating expenses for the Mongolian Autonomous Political Affairs Committee approved by the Executive Yuan has not yet been allocated by the Ministry of Finance, so he has not been able to go to Bailing Temple to handle affairs. After Kong Xiangxi returns to Nanjing, he will negotiate with him. Even if 30,000 yuan cannot be fully allocated each month, a portion should be allocated, otherwise the political affairs of the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee cannot be promoted. The passenger and freight vehicles promised by the Ministry of Communications are also urgently needed during the implementation of the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee's policies. The Ministry of Communications replied that they can be shipped from Shanghai to Nanjing on the 10th and will be handed over to Chen Gengya to transport them to Bailing Temple first. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gengyang said: (1) The Mongolian Political Affairs Committee's previous budget did not include the expenses of the guard team and the newly established radio station, so the number of 30,000 yuan approved by the central government is quite different from the actual needs. It has now consulted with Bailing Temple to create a separate budget and send it to the central government for review. (2) The committee sent Shara Baatar and Puying Dalai to urge the director-general and deputy director-general to take office in Nanjing. Chairman He has already agreed and plans to build a director-general's office in Suiyuan. Ba and others are now going to Shanxi to urge Zhao Daiwen to take office.

<p>San Francisco. Labor unrest of varying degrees of severity has reportedly broken out in various industrial areas of the United States. However, the conflict between dockworkers and police here, which resulted in two deaths and many injuries, has now subsided. The waterfront area resembles a military camp, with armed troops patrolling the streets. California Governor Merriam is determined to use all the means within his power to prevent a recurrence of the disturbances. Although the National Guard will not use force beyond what is necessary, they may use their bayonets and bullets if the unrest recurs. If absolutely necessary, machine guns may also be opened. The striking dockworkers are currently quiet, focusing on a general strike movement. The labor unrest has the potential to spread to Portland, where representatives of eighty labor unions have already instructed union officials to discuss a general strike plan. It is reported that labor unrest has broken out to varying degrees in Oklahoma City, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia. The issue of a general strike has now been referred to the union strategy committee, which will promote an organized movement to bring about a nationwide strike. Today, representatives from one hundred and twenty labor unions voted to support the union officials' plan and passed a strongly worded resolution denouncing the state authorities' use of force to suppress the actions of the strikers. Tacoma and Seattle are currently quiet. The port of Tacoma is gradually becoming aware of the situation and is trying to facilitate trade between Tacoma and Alaska. Strike leaders and shipping companies have reached an agreement, so Tacoma workers have started loading cargo onto four merchant ships today for shipment to Alaska. It is reported that no fewer than four hundred passengers are traveling to Alaska by ship this afternoon, and goods are being transported by special train from other places to Tacoma for transfer to Alaska in an endless stream. Merchants in Seattle are concerned that Tacoma is monopolizing Alaskan commerce and fisheries. It is expected that they will also discuss a solution with strike leaders in the next few days to quell the dispute and restore trade there. However, the situation in Tacoma is not entirely peaceful due to this agreement. It is reported that the city's business community has formed an emergency committee advocating the deployment of armed troops in the harbor to open the entire port. However, the mayor claims that he does not want to take this action because dockworkers from Seattle, Olympia, and other nearby locations have already started working in Tacoma, loading cargo onto ships bound for Alaska.

Residents are not allowed to go outside between certain hours of the day and night; violators will be shot. It is reported that the disturbances have spread elsewhere. Incidents have occurred in Rotterdam, Hilversum, and Groningen, but they were quickly quelled by the military and police working together, and several people were arrested. Prime Minister Colijn and Defense Minister Dijxhoorn arrived here today to investigate the truth. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Amsterdam. As a result of forty-eight hours of continuous fighting between Communist Party members and police here, seven people have died and more than fifty have been injured. Other locations known as Communist Party strongholds, such as the Jordaan district, have experienced riots, an event unseen in the peaceful Netherlands for many years. Communist Party members in the Jordaan district had set up barbed wire obstacles and other things. However, the police and supporting troops have cleared all obstacles from the streets. Dutch Prime Minister Colijn arrived here this afternoon to advise the public, but the situation shows no signs of easing. Riots broke out again this morning. The Communist Party's newspaper, which has been inciting public unrest for days, has now been occupied by the police, and all printing presses have been confiscated. The government has now ordered that unemployed workers who participated in the riots will no longer be eligible for public assistance. Furthermore, in order to prevent the spread of the riots, the Prime Minister has requested special powers from Parliament to dissolve the Communist Party in the country. It is said that the recent events were orchestrated by the Communist Party. The government has also added a company of grenade launchers, two hundred foot police, two hundred mounted police, and many infantry and engineers, with machine guns, stationed at the scene of the incident to suppress it.

<p>The Number of Japanese Police Escorting the Train Increases From Seven to Eleven</p>
<p>Problems in the War Zone to Be Resolved After Huang Fu Returns to Beiping</p>
<p>Beiping correspondence: During Sino-Japanese consultations regarding security matters on the Beiping-Shenyang train line, it was decided that the Chinese side would be responsible for the section within the Great Wall, and the Japanese side would be responsible for the section outside the Great Wall. When train service began to resume on July 1, the Japanese side suddenly dispatched seven so-called "police escorts," requesting to accompany the train for protection. After the Chinese side argued based on reason, the Japanese side agreed to limit it to one week, after which they would withdraw. In the past week, the number of Japanese police escorts has actually increased from seven to eleven. In addition, they carry light machine guns and are fully armed on the train, following behind our railway police and conducting inspections. As of today (the 7th), the one-week limit has expired. When the Beiping-Shenyang train departed from Beiping at 8:45 this morning, there were still eleven Japanese police officers, armed, accompanying the train. At the same time, the second Beiping-Shenyang train arriving from Shenyang also had Japanese police following. Because Director Yin Tong of the Beiping-Ning Railway Bureau has resigned, all foreign affairs negotiations have been suspended, and no negotiations have been initiated with the Japanese side. At the same time, the Japanese side is using the excuse that safety on the line east of Tanggu is still a problem and has decided not to withdraw for the time being.</p>
<p>Since the bombing of the Beiping-Shenyang train at Chadian, the Railway Bureau has ordered the Tianjin Beiping-Ning Railway Police Department to strictly guard each station along the route. The Tangshan Police Section has recently dispatched police to strictly guard each station on the Tang-Yu section. Unexpectedly, on the 5th, the first Beiping-Shenyang train departing from Beiping was struck by a large rock (approximately two feet in diameter) at the Hangu train station at around 1:00 p.m., smashing two third-class train windows. One passenger suffered minor injuries. A search was conducted, but the person who threw the rock had already escaped without a trace. Currently, key locations along the line are heavily guarded. Japanese troops are guarding and inspecting passengers at each station in the section outside the Great Wall: Qiansuo, Suizhong, Lianshan Bay, Dahu Mountain, and Juliu River. As for the internal affairs of the Eastern Travel Agency, the important liquidation and business departments are controlled by the Japanese, with only the document and general affairs departments managed by the Chinese side.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of abolishing the Tanggu Truce Agreement, Yin Rugeng, the administrative inspector of the Jizhou-Miyun District, and Tao Shangming, the administrative inspector of the Yu District, recently received a telegram from Huang Fu, the chairman of the Political Readjustment Committee, stating that the central government has ordered negotiations with the Japanese side to abolish the Tanggu Truce Agreement. Therefore, all problems in the war zone can be resolved as a whole, without the need for direct negotiations. As a result, all matters concerning the rotation of the security team in the war zone and the withdrawal of Japanese troops from various passes along the Great Wall have been suspended, pending Huang Fu's return to the north to negotiate the abolition of the Tanggu Agreement. Huang recently sent a telegram to the Political Readjustment Committee, stating that he will go to Shanghai from Mogan Mountain this week and is expected to return to the north in mid-month. Yin Rugeng has agreed with the Japanese side that the handover of the Eastern Tombs will be carried out before the 18th of this month and has scheduled to leave Beiping for Malanyu on the 15th.

<p>Changchun Correspondence: The Japanese army is currently actively carrying out its invasion of Mongolia. In eastern Mongolia and the Xilin Gol League, they are confiscating civilian firearms, disbanding Mongolian troops, and completing the construction of the Lixi-Duolun automobile road, transporting large quantities of military equipment and ammunition. Under the pressure of their iron hooves, the people of the Xilin Gol League dare not do anything. Currently, only the western league of Inner Mongolia remains intact. If the Xilin Gol League is occupied, the gateway to the western league will be opened, and all of Inner Mongolia will belong to the Japanese. However, Inner Mongolia still has 150,000 cavalrymen, fully equipped with firearms. If there are capable and spirited generals to unify command and rigorously train them, it may not be impossible to resist. The people of Inner Mongolia also share a common hatred of the enemy.</p>
<p>In addition to military aggression in western Mongolia, the Japanese are also using a so-called two-year plan to periodically survey the mineral, commercial, agricultural, aquatic, hunting, pastoral, and industrial resources, as well as the distribution, types, quantities, and nature of commercial transactions in northern Mongolia and Xing'an, attempting to establish the fundamental direction and foundation for their industrial development. They have now established a temporary industrial survey bureau with the puppet business community to formulate and implement the plan. The puppet state has agreed to provide 800,000 yuan to cover expenses. The industrial bureau survey organization is divided into three industrial and commercial classes and thirty resource survey classes, requiring a total of approximately 1,500 personnel.

<h3 id="e78">Gansu's Diebu Prefecture Eagerly Awaits Development <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Formerly Belonged to Us Before the Ming and Qing Dynasties</p>
<p>Fell to the Tubo After Repeated Warfare</p>
<p>Lanzhou Airmail: Approximately two hundred li southwest of Taozhou and Minxian in Gansu is a place called Diebu. Before the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was within our territory, and was a zhou (prefecture) along with Taozhou and Minxian, i.e., the four zhou of Tao, Min, Die, and Dang, as described in history. Later, after repeated warfare, it fell to the Tubo. Taozhou and Minxian were soon restored, but Diebu, because it was slightly out of the way and easily became remote, ended up being overlooked. It is said that the eastern border of this place is Taozhou and Minxian, the southern border is the Sichuan frontier, the western border is former Tibet, and the northern border is Qinghai. The soil is fertile, the climate is warm, the forests are lush, and the rivers wind around. Currently, many people from Lintao, Minxian, Linxia, Zhang, and Long counties go to this place to cut wood and collect medicinal herbs, and they all reap substantial profits. An investigation of the conditions in this place is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) People: Starting from Houguo'an, the people in each village are sparse and by nature ignorant. They all make a living by farming. More indigenous Tubo people from the upper and lower temples are harbored. There are more than two hundred monks in the temples. Many merchants from Lintan trade here. Dihasi Temple is also inhabited by indigenous people and has a church, and the missionaries are all British. The rest graze livestock in search of water and grass and rarely have villages.</p>
<p>(2) Land: The eastern border is Taozhou and Minxian, the southern border is the Sichuan frontier, the western border is former Tibet, and the northern border is Qinghai. The mountains surrounding it on all sides are cliffs, making it a natural and secure place. The mountain roads in places such as Luoda Mountain, Jianzang Mao Ya Ya, etc., are rugged. The area harboring the upper and lower temples to Ni'elu is slightly flatter. The land in Zhaozigou is fertile and flat, and there are hundreds of qing (unit of area) that can be reclaimed as paddy fields in the dam. There are many plains on both banks of the Baishui River, and seven or eight places like Zhaozigou can be opened as paddy fields by diverting canals for irrigation.</p>
<p>(3) Jurisdiction: Diebu is mostly a Fan (Tibetan) tribe. The indigenous people are scattered and graze livestock in search of water and grass. There are no special administrative organs.</p>
<p>(4) Climate: From Luoda to Wocang Temple, the climate is mild. Summer wheat is harvested before Xiaoshu (Minor Heat). From Wocang Temple to Diebu, summer wheat is harvested after Dashu (Major Heat). The climate from Diebu to Lamu Temple and above is slightly cold. The land is mostly flat and suitable for highland barley, oats, buckwheat, and beans. Animal husbandry is excellent.</p>
<p>(5) Products: All kinds of grains are produced from Luoda to Wocang Temple, and vegetables are very good, such as grapes, chili peppers, jujubes, tobacco leaves, dried persimmons, and persimmons. Cotton is especially produced. The rock salt produced from Dadagusi in Luoda is of excellent quality and taste and can also be a special product.</p>
<p>There are many mines along both banks of the Baishui River, and the mineral deposits are very rich. For example, at the Shangxia Gold Mines opened by the Fan people of Luota, each person can pan for more than five qian (unit of weight) of gold per day. The iron ore east of Wocang Temple often floats to the surface. The Fan people do not smelt it but can use it to make utensils. The excellence of their manufacturing can be imagined. According to the Englishman Mr. Ke, there are two mature coal mountains on the south bank of the Baishui River. Because the Fan people use pine wood for fuel, they have not been mined. If the government establishes an agency to nationalize all mineral products and use new methods for mining, then the barren land will be transformed into a zone glittering with gold. In the current state of economic decline, it would be a small supplement to the country. The grassland in this area is very wide. The Fan people all live by nomadism, so they produce many fine horses and oxen. For example, cattle and horse dealers from Taozhou and Minxian, in groups, sell cattle and horses from this place every June and July. Statistics show that more than 20,000 cattle and horses are sold to Shaanxi and Gansu each year. As for livestock such as pigs and sheep, the Fan people use them as rice and wheat for food, and the amount produced is incalculable. If the government establishes a horse farm and changes the diet to livestock, not only will there be military horses, but the tax revenue obtained will also be considerable. As for medicinal materials and furs, this place, from Tianluota to Heihe, is approximately four hundred li in length. Apart from forests, medicinal materials are produced everywhere, whether on mountains, rivers, or in valleys, such as rhubarb, dangshen, jiao, fritillaria bulbs, deer velvet, and musk, which are a major category of mountain products. Merchants from Tianjin, Wuhan, Shanxi, and Taozhou sell them to Zhongba in Sichuan and Shanyuan in Shaanxi. Taking rhubarb, dangshen, and jiao as examples, there are at least five thousand dan (unit of weight) per year. As for furs such as sheepskin, fox skin, wolf skin, leopard skin, otter skin, and gold thread velvet, the amount produced is also large. When immigrants cultivate the land, they can dig up various medicinal materials from within the cultivated land, which is truly a win-win situation.</p>
<p>(6) Roads: From Minxian to Guzha Road is 30 li. Going southwest along the ditch for about 10 li is Dacaotan. Going straight southwest for about 40 li to Dala Mountain, going over the mountain for 10 li to Dala Ditch, passing through villages such as Zhuliliqi Kangduojiancang, you arrive at Luoda. From Luoda, going upstream along the river, passing through Lianghekou to Deguo Temple, these temples all belong to Houyacun in Minxian. The road is very dangerous. There are two bridges here, one called Mao Ya Bridge and one called Wo Bridge. After passing the bridge, go 40 li to Womao Lower Temple. Nearby is Wocang Village, about several li away, and then there is Wocang Upper Temple. Going along the river for 60 li to Ni'e Village, and along the river into Zhaozigou, you arrive at Dihasi Temple, which is 60 li away. Dihasi Temple has a church. From Dihasi Temple to Diecheng is 30 li. From Diecheng to Lamu Temple is about 70 li. There is also a church here. The land is mostly flat and easy to travel.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Fujian Province Divides Administrative Inspectorate Districts; District Commissioners Concurrently Serve as County Magistrates of Resident Counties; Minhou and Siming Counties Directly Under the Jurisdiction of the Department of Civil Affairs <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Fujian Province has recently divided the province into ten administrative inspectorate districts. All commissioners, except Xu Huhu of the Second District, who is handling industrial accounts in Fuding in eastern Fujian, are in Nanchang: Wang Boqiu of the Second District, Tang Yintang of the Third District, Meng Ping of the Fourth District, Yang Yongbin of the Fifth District, Zhu Xi of the Sixth District, Chen Zhuoru of the Seventh District, Lin Sixian of the Eighth District, Qin Zhenfu of the Ninth District, and Sheng Kaidi of the Tenth District. Around the 15th of this month, they will transfer from Jiangxi to Shanghai and then come to Fujian to be sworn in. After taking office, they will go to their respective resident counties to establish offices and work. All administrative commissioners concurrently serve as county magistrates of the resident counties, so the commissioner's office and the county government are located in the same place. All section chiefs and secretaries concurrently serve in both positions. The commissioner's office only has six staff members, eight employees, and two technicians. The cost is subsidized by the Nanchang camp at 2,000 yuan per month, and the provincial government pays 1,000 yuan per month (that is, the funds of the current four security branch offices in the east, west, north, and south districts will be reduced and transferred for use). The most important duties of the commissioners are to revitalize the countryside, organize rural militias, prohibit drugs, and suppress local bullies. The counties under the jurisdiction of each district have also been delineated as follows: The First District governs eight counties: Changle, Gutian, Pingtan, Minqing, Lianjiang, Luoyuan, Yongtai, and Fuqing, and is stationed in Changle. The Second District governs six counties: Fu'an, Xiapu, Fuding, Ningde, Shouning, and Pingnan, and is stationed in Fu'an. The Third District governs six counties: Nanping, Jiangle, Shaxian, Shunchang, Youxi, and Yong'an, and is stationed in Nanping. The Fourth District governs five counties: Xianyou, Putian, Yongchun, Dehua, and Datian, and is stationed in Xianyou. The Fifth District governs five counties: Tongan, Anxi, Jinjiang, Hui'an, and Nan'an, and is stationed in Tongan. The Sixth District governs six counties: Zhangpu, Changtai, Haicheng, Yunxiao, Zhao'an, and Longxi, and is stationed in Zhangpu. The Seventh District governs five counties: Longyan, Ningyang, Zhangping, Nanjing, and Pinghe, and is stationed in Longyan. The Eighth District governs five counties: Yongding, Changting, Shanghang, Wuping, and Liancheng, and is stationed in Yongding. The Ninth District governs six counties: Shaowu, Jianning, Taining, Ninghua, Mingxi, and Qingliu, and is stationed in Shaowu. The Tenth District governs six counties: Pucheng, Chong'an, Jianyang, Jian'ou, Songxi, and Zhenghe, and is stationed in Pucheng. Only Minhou and Siming counties, one being the provincial capital and the other being a commercial port, are directly under the jurisdiction of the Department of Civil Affairs and are not within the administrative inspectorate area.

<h3 id="e80">Drought and Famine in Various Counties in Southern Anhui <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Second District Commissioner Establishes a New Wuhu</p>
<p>Wuhu News: Since the beginning of summer, the counties in southern Anhui have not received any rain, and the weather has been extremely hot and dry. The temperature is consistently above 100 degrees, and even indoors it is between 98 and 99 degrees. There is no wind at all, making it impossible to cool down. The mountain villages of Wuhu, Yicheng, Nanling, Ningguo, Tongling, Qingyang, Guichi, and Tongcheng are all suffering from drought. Ponds have dried up, and the land has cracked. The farmland in each county is no less than several million mu (unit of area), and rice and grain harvested in the autumn are the only products. During this hot summer, irrigation is needed, but there is little water, making transport difficult. Prayers for rain are everywhere, and the signs of drought and famine have already formed. Farmers are fearful all day long, and the rural economy has long been bankrupt. Few families have accumulated food. If the autumn harvest is indeed hopeless, the impact is difficult to predict. Therefore, rice prices have been rising steadily in recent days. The market prices of all types of rice have risen by several qian (unit of currency) per shi (unit of volume). First-grade rice costs 4 liang and 9 qian and 5 fen (unit of weight), second-grade costs 4 liang and 8 qian and 3 fen, and the next grade costs 4 liang and 7 qian and 5 fen. Rice from river milling in prefectures costs from 4 liang and 5 qian and 2 fen to 4 liang and 8 fen. Prices are expected to continue to rise in the future, as the number of sellers is gradually decreasing. Wang Zhuren, the administrative commissioner of the Second District of Anhui and concurrently the magistrate of Wuhu County, believes that the rice market in Anhui has always been concentrated in Wuhu, which is the center of Anhui's business community. The Wuhu-Tunxi and Nanjing-Wuhu highways have recently opened, and the Nanjing-Wuhu and Wuhu-Zha railway lines are under construction. With seamless transportation, commerce, travel, and military affairs are gradually becoming the hub of the Yangtze River. However, the construction of the city cannot be compared to Nanjing and Shanghai, and even compared to Xunzhen and other places, it is inferior. In order to build a ring road around the city, a road along the river wharf, and to revitalize the market from Beiping Road to the railway station area, approximately 500,000 yuan is needed. A plan has been prepared and submitted to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the Anhui Provincial Government, and the Department of Construction, requesting that construction funds be increased by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan per year from this year onward to allow for step-by-step construction.

<h3 id="e81">Bandits in Southern Anhui Raid Wuyuan; Troops Sent to Suppress, Bandits Flee to Chengjiashan; Liu Zhenhua Sets Deadline to Suppress Banditry in Northern Anhui <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Commander Chiang Kai-shek previously proposed that Wuyuan County in Huizhou, southern Anhui, be placed under the jurisdiction of Jiangxi Province in order to facilitate command, since it is adjacent to the Jiangxi border, allowing bandits to emerge and raid. This has already been approved by the Executive Yuan. Unexpectedly, at this time, more than a thousand bandits suddenly arrived at Kaihua Fangcun in the third district of the county. They were wearing yellow uniforms and carrying hundreds of rifles and box cannons. First, they occupied Lizhuang, looting slightly due to the poverty of the countryside and kidnapping four people for ransom, before heading to Jixi Town and causing great disturbance. No shop or resident was spared. They also kidnapped twenty-three people for ransom, before invading Zhentou. They encountered the independent platoon of the militia of the second and third districts across the river, and exchanged fire. The militia, outnumbered, was forced to retreat to the entrance of Yongyuan Village. The bandits finally rushed into Jiangwan Town at night, causing an uproar, with miserable cries shaking the sky. People fled, carrying the old and the young, climbing over mountains. The next morning, as a unit of infantry from the 272nd Regiment of the 55th Division arrived, the bandits began to retreat to their old nest in Xinjian in the tenth district of Dexing. At the same time, a large group of bandits also raided Qimen County from the Fubian area, first disturbing the 24th district before approaching the city gates, setting fires and looting before fleeing towards Chengjiashan. It is reported that two regiments of provincial troops have arrived in the western township of the county, so morale has stabilized somewhat. The county governments have reported to headquarters, requesting the dispatch of large forces to encircle and suppress the bandits to prevent them from spreading.</p>
<p>Liu Zhenhua, the commander of the joint suppression of bandits in the border area of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, believes that banditry in various counties in northern Anhui has not been eradicated. Now that the green gauze screens have risen, he has decided to take the opportunity to set a deadline of two months to suppress the bandits. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Xiamen Bandits Rob Two Money Shops <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Robbed of Over a Thousand Several Hundred Yuan, All Shops Closed for One Day</p>
<p>General Chamber of Commerce and Money Trade Associations Set Deadline for Public Security Bureau to Solve Case</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Recently, the situation in Xiamen has been unstable, with bandits appearing from time to time. On the afternoon of the 2nd, at 2 PM, two money shops on Datie Road were robbed simultaneously at the same location. Afterwards, all the bandits escaped, leading to the closure of all money shops in the city for one day. The Chamber of Commerce has set a deadline to solve the case, causing a significant reaction. As of today, the case has not been solved. On the afternoon of the 2nd, at 2 PM sharp, the city's money shops were in full operation, and it was a Monday, so the amount of money being received was even higher than usual. Four men wearing white silk and black Xiangyun gauze shirts and pants suddenly came to Yongkang Exchange Money Shop at No. 27 Datie Street. One of them presented 20 silver dollars and 12.4 yuan in small coins to exchange for 30 yuan in banknotes. The owner's younger brother, Su Guanghan, accepted the money and exchanged it for banknotes. Unexpectedly, the man suddenly approached Su and pointed a gun at his chest, forcing him to hand over the safe key. The other three bandits, two of whom went inside to rob, one guarded the front and side doors, and the other cut the telephone line to monitor the staff. One bandit outside the door held a Mauser pistol to watch for any wind. Passersby and neighbors thought it was police officers conducting a raid, so many stopped to watch. They then saw the bandits take the money from the wooden safe. The bandit guarding the door scattered the silver dollars in the middle of the street. The crowd then realized that it was a robbery and dispersed. At the same time, at Longyi Money Shop at No. 126 Datie Street, diagonally across from Yongkang, three men also wearing white silk and black Xiangyun gauze shirts and pants arrived. One of them, wearing ink-colored crystal glasses, presented 11.21 yuan in small coins to exchange for 9 silver dollars. After the shop assistant, Lu Jinlong, made the exchange, the bandit then presented 21 silver dollars to exchange for banknotes. When Lu was about to hand over the money, the bandit suddenly pulled out a gun and pointed it at Lu, ordering him to hand over the money safe key. Lu was terrified and ran away, exiting the rear door into Shi Lane to call for help. The bandits then entered the safe to search and rob the money. The other two bandits also entered, all with guns. One guarded the telephone, and one stood outside the door. However, since the staff at Longyi had already escaped through the rear door, the bandits did not dare to stay for long. They hurriedly searched and were about to sort the two thousand yuan in stamped silver that Hengchang had sent over, as well as the 594 yuan in stamped silver that Dingchang Money Shop had sent over, all of which were placed on the counter. The bandits then poured all the stamped silver into the street. For a moment, the clanging sound filled the air, and the street was covered in silver. The three bandits then retreated. The four bandits from Yongkang also retreated into the street at the same time. The two groups of bandits converged and fled towards Wangye Temple at the beginning of Datie Road. In front of Haifeng Trading Company, about 20 steps away from Yongkang Longyi, the bandits turned around and fired more than ten shots as a warning. Two holes were made in the Haifeng signboard, one hole in the Jinshengchang Inn signboard, three bullets hit the walls of the shops, and three bullets hit the ground. Chen Tian, the owner of Xielong in the same street, was hit by a bullet in his crotch, with two holes piercing through the front and back of his trousers. Fortunately, he was not injured. A police officer on duty nearby heard the shots and rushed to the scene, but the bandits had already fled. Because he was unarmed, he only dared to follow them at a distance and was unable to catch them, so they all escaped. The entire incident lasted only five minutes. Afterwards, an inspection revealed that Yongkang Su Tianhan's safe key was missing and had not been handed over. Lu Jinlong from Longyi had escaped, and the safe had not been opened. Only the wooden safes were searched. The bandits only took a small amount of cash. Yongkang was robbed of 813.6 silver dollars, and Longyi was robbed of 516 silver dollars, 301 yuan in paper money, 52.3 yuan in small coins, and one 5-yuan Japanese gold ticket, totaling over 900 yuan. The two shops were robbed of over 1700 yuan in total. After this incident occurred, all the money shops in the city immediately closed. At 3 PM, the Money Shops Association held an emergency meeting, which all the shops attended. As a result, representatives were sent to the General Chamber of Commerce to request that they go to the Public Security Bureau to urge a strict investigation. The General Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4 PM, which all the money shops attended. It was resolved (regarding the case on this afternoon at 2 PM, bandits robbed Yongkang and Longyi Money Shops on Datie Road simultaneously in broad daylight on a main thoroughfare, setting a new record for robbery cases in Xiamen's history, greatly harming local security and commerce, it was resolved to request the Public Security Bureau to solve the case within three days and severely punish the perpetrators according to the regulations for punishing bandits. Otherwise, merchants will have no protection and will be unable to do business. A general meeting should be convened to properly discuss solutions). As for all the money shops in the city, they will temporarily resume normal business from the 3rd, while awaiting the handling of this case. On the one hand, a telegram was sent to Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Gupan to attend a meeting to discuss the matter. Wang sent Chief Inspector Lin Tinggan to the Chamber of Commerce to express that the Public Security Bureau had ordered the detective team to solve the case within a time limit. At the same time, the Second Sub-Bureau reported that they had seen the bandits enter the tea and gambling house opposite Hefuqing on Ci Street. They then cooperated with the Japanese consulate staff to search and arrest them, while surrounding the area near Ci Street. However, after a long time, nothing was found. The case is now under control. Please allow the money shops to resume normal business so that the Public Security Bureau can focus on handling this case, etc. As of the 5th, the three-day deadline had passed, and there was still no trace of the bandits. The General Chamber of Commerce, in response to the Money Shops Association, convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors, resolving to send Chairman Hong Xiaochun to the Public Security Bureau on the 6th to urge a speedy resolution of the case, with a deadline of the 9th. If the case cannot be solved by then, a general meeting will be convened to resolve the matter. Until the matter is resolved, all money shops will continue to operate as usual. Therefore, this case is still in a serious state. (6th)</p>

<p>Small Dam and Big Dam</p>
<p>On the 22nd, at 3 AM, we departed Wang Hong Fort. In the faint morning light, the car sped past the Ning Shuo county government. Only a few simple houses were visible, along with a screen wall, earthen roofs and earthen walls, with the doors and walls slightly whitewashed. A postal worker driving a donkey passed me. I got out of the car and walked with him, talking. According to him, he had been a postal worker for ten years, earning over twenty yuan a month, and had never been in arrears. However, as he was getting older, he was deeply afraid of being dismissed. He lived in Da Ba, where his wife and children farmed. They cultivated ten mu of land themselves, yielding five shi of wheat, worth 150 yuan. After paying the Qing Xiang fee of 25 yuan, the labor levy for dam construction of 10 yuan, and grain of two shi and four dou, totaling 72 yuan, only 43 yuan remained. This was barely enough to cover the costs of tools and fertilizer. However, when faced with miscellaneous levies and disasters, they were often at risk of freezing and starvation. When asked if he grew tobacco, he replied that growing tobacco required superior land, good fertilizer, and a large amount of capital, which he had nowhere to borrow. Moreover, it was easy to be stolen at harvest time, so he usually did not grow it. However, even if he did not grow tobacco, the Qing Xiang fee still had to be paid. According to statistics, Ning Shuo County should pay a Qing Xiang fee of 350,000 yuan this year, starting from May 1st for a period of five months, with 30% to be collected by the end of June, another collection by the end of August, and the full amount collected by the end of this month. The county has 181,200 mu of land. The land that was affected by the disaster last year is still difficult to cultivate this year and should be removed from the calculation, totaling over 24,040 mu. The actual area is 157,150 mu. According to the amount, each mu should pay 2 yuan, 2 jiao, 2 fen, 7 li, 2 hao. In addition, there are additional district fees, the amount of which has not yet been determined, but it is feared that it will be at least above the 2 yuan and 5 jiao collected last year. In Hedong Jinji County, each mu is levied over 3 yuan and 3 jiao. In addition to collecting the exact amount, the collectors also forcibly take a tip of four or five jiao (the county servants who collect grain often have no salary). If they are not given the tip, they will drag away bedding and clothes.</p>
<p>Fifteen li (Huinong Canal Office). The fort is built like a square city, with slogans pasted on the walls such as "Welcome Chairman Song to Develop the Northwest with Economic Strength" and "The Qinghai Army is the Living Buddha of the Northwest". A rustic old man digging vegetables on the canal embankment seemed to suspect that we were officials (those in Western clothes were traveling together). He cupped his hands and asked, "Are you traveling with Song?" He then muttered to himself, "One or two days before Song was scheduled to arrive in Ning, I heard that he would inspect the big dam. The farmers and merchants along the way who could provide rest stops and reception venues were told by the district and township chiefs, 'If Song asks about the people's sentiments, you can only say good things, and never say bad things, otherwise you will be punished.' When Song gave a speech at the mass welcome rally, I leaned on my walking stick and went to listen. I saw an unhappy look on Song's face, and he didn't speak much. Could it be that he noticed our people's suffering, and that the officials are too harsh and greedy, and that someone risked their lives to complain to him?" The attention of the border people to the words, deeds and expressions of important figures is such that their earnest expectations of the central government can also be faintly seen.</p>
<p>After traveling several li, we paralleled the Han Canal. There were rat holes in the canal banks, and swallows used them as nests. White eggs and yellow chicks could be seen by looking down. Old swallows flew towards us in groups, seemingly unafraid of people. Passing Li Jun Fort, Ye Sheng Fort, and other places, we saw two or three cemeteries. The graves were marked with soil, which was very different from the mounds of earth and tombstones in the hinterland. The Xiaoba River was sparkling with water. The canal ditches, bridges, water level, and other constructions were all suitable for the terrain. There was a pavilion on the dam called "Xi Rui", with the couplet "The pond is full of water and the spring grass is green, the sky opens and the painting is full of evening mountains". On the opposite bank of the pavilion was the "Han Yan Canal Office" and its affiliated nursery. The Dragon God Temple was also listed there. The Canal Office has an elementary school, combining science and classics. The teacher mistook the Prime Minister's will of (dedicate ourselves to revolution) into (make effort to revolutionize), and (for forty years) into (has been forty years). A certain former director of the Ning Provincial Civil Affairs Office mistakenly wrote on a registration certificate issued last year, including the Prime Minister's instruction, (what our party advocates) mistaken the "advocates" into "obeys (the principle is to follow)", mistaken the "principle" to "this". The business has been hung for a long time without realizing it, and it is almost invisible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Li Jun Fort, Wang Hong Fort, Ye Sheng Fort, and other places along the way are all named after people. The canals are crisscrossed and dense as fields. The soil is fertile and the produce is abundant. The plants and trees are secluded and beautiful. Nowhere else can all of these things be found at the same time. At 3 PM, we arrived at Da Ba and stayed for the night, covering 70 li. Da Ba used to be an important hub in the Northwest. Later, due to repeated wars, it became a ruin, and the population gradually decreased. The buildings surrounding the dam include the Tang Lai Canal Office, Qing Lai Pavilion, Cang Lang Pavilion, Wen Chang Palace, Dragon King Temple, and Bull King Temple, which are magnificent. The Bull King Temple enshrines the Bull King, the Horse King, and Su Wu. The incense is usually strong. Building dams and canals, singing operas to honor the gods, attracting crowds from far and wide, and blocking the roads for the purpose. Nowadays, due to bad harvests, frequent disasters, and insufficient manpower, the incense is dwindling. There is no money to sing operas, so the stage has been demolished. The abbot talked about it with emotion.</p>

All the passengers fell into the river. The cries for help were very tragic. At that time, because no one rescued them, eighteen people, including Tu Fugeng, drowned at the same time. Later, Chief Zhou of the Public Security Bureau of the jurisdiction sent police to salvage the bodies. Seventeen bodies were salvaged, which was also tragic.</p>

Deputy Team Leader Fan presented a silk military flag to the team, which was received by Team Leader Lu. After the county magistrate gave a speech, the team returned to their post. It is now known that in order to show their spirit, the team will not take boats or cars to Xixi for inspection. They will walk in stages in the morning of the 9th, arriving in Xixi after spending a night in Yangfu. They will arrive in Xixi on the 10th and are currently preparing their equipment.</p>

<p>The county has not rained for two months, and the drought is extremely severe. Farmland cannot be sown, and there are problems with drinking water. Although there was a brief shower the day before yesterday, it only amounted to just over an inch, and the weather cooled down slightly, but it was of no benefit to agriculture. Therefore, dragon kings are still being worshipped everywhere, and prayers for rain continue. The bronze Dragon King of Sanfeng Dragon Palace was also respectfully welcomed into the city by gentry and merchants and enshrined in Huiri Temple. Many people from all walks of life have come to offer incense and prayers. County Magistrate Zhou Heng, in order to follow public opinion, also goes to worship and offer incense at 5 AM every morning. The county government also issued a notice continuing the ban on slaughter for three days. On the 7th, it was discovered that Zhang Hexing Meat Shop was selling pork privately, and the shop owner Zhang Changming was arrested and fined. However, the weather has been clear and sunny for days, and there is still no sign of rain.</p>

<p>Since Xia Zhenlong took office as the director of the Business Tax Bureau in Wuxi, he has actively reorganized the bureau, and tax revenue has gradually improved. However, business owners have requested a reduction in tax rates due to the sluggish business climate. Recently, the tax bureau has not investigated the capital of various industries but has freely increased tax rates, harassing merchants and creating disputes. Yesterday, Jin Da Tai Sheng and other silk shops in Jiangyin Lane paid taxes according to the original amount, but the tax bureau refused to accept it. Therefore, they followed the decision made at the temporary meeting of various industries convened by the county chamber of commerce on the 25th of last month and paid the 780 yuan tax to Jiangsu Bank, separately stored. In addition, Zhuang Yuan Da Oil Factory, with a capital of 3,000, paid taxes according to the amount. Starting from the autumn of the 22nd year, the tax bureau levied taxes according to a capital of 8,000 yuan, an increase of more than double, which is really unbearable. Therefore, they also handed over the tax of 20 yuan that should be paid to the oil factory guild and transferred it to Jiangsu Bank for separate storage. At the same time, they sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce, forwarding it to the county government and the business tax bureau for investigation, to show their response.</p>

<p>Rong Zongjing, a native of the county, founded flour mills, textile factories, and other factories, totaling twenty-one, with assets of over 90 million yuan. He pays more than 10,000 yuan in national taxes every day, and the annual tax revenue is over 3 million yuan. In recent days, newspapers in Shanghai and Wuxi have reported that Rong has resigned from his position as general manager due to illness and that Rong has hired Wang Yuqing, a native of the county, as general manager. The reporter believed that this matter was of great importance to the country and society, so he went to visit the Wuxi authorities of Shenxin and Maoxin factories. According to them, Rong had been ill once last year and has recently recovered. However, in order to maintain his energy and devote his full efforts to the development of various factory businesses, he hired Wang Yuqing, the former manager of Fuxin, as general manager to jointly seek development. Rong himself does not leave the company. All the rumors are fabricated by newspapers of a certain country in an attempt to sabotage China's great industry.</p>

<p>Cai Ziping, the county magistrate of Wujin, has been in office for more than a year.

Taking advantage of the construction department director's telegram summoning him to the province to discuss road construction issues, he also went to the civil affairs department to meet with Director Yu Jingtang and pleaded to resign. Director Yu consoled him and urged him to reluctantly do his best. After County Magistrate Cai returned to Changzhou, it was reported that his resignation was firm and he had submitted his resignation again in order to recuperate.</p>

<p>Li Xianglin, a 26-year-old man from Chongming, enlisted as a porter in the Fujian province through the county's recruitment office in June of the year before last. Because he could not bear the pain of carrying heavy loads, he escaped in February of this year. He begged all the way from Fujian and Zhejiang and arrived in Cheng on the 5th. Near Huangtian Port, he could not return home. He hanged himself from a poplar tree with his belt. He was spotted and rescued by villagers and reported to Hua Xiongzhong, the director of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, who gave him five silver dollars to buy a Dada steamboat ticket and sent him back to his hometown.</p>

<p>Yangzhou is an important area in Jiangbei. Because of the salt industry, commerce is particularly prosperous. Since the Transportation Department moved to Qu (浦), commerce has plummeted. In addition, the rural economy is depressed. Therefore, dozens of shops in the bustling marketplace along Yuanmen Bridge and Duozi Street have closed one after another. Although the county chamber of commerce has tried to find ways to remedy the situation, it has been ineffective. It is rumored that Salt Transportation Envoy Miao recently instructed the Si'an Public Office of the county to inform the salt merchants to purchase private land in Banpu and that there are drawings to build a new village. All salt businesses will be moved to Banpu to operate. If this plan is implemented, the market in Yangzhou will be even more unbearable. Therefore, salt merchants have been hesitating about this matter in recent days.</p>

<p>Ji Shenghuai, the 35-year-old son of Ji Jinchuan, a farmer from Xilin Township in the Fourth District, hired his wife Chen to Shen Duxin's family in the same village because of his family's poverty. Shen saw that Chen was somewhat attractive, so on March 18th of this year, he colluded with Shen Duxin, Shen Zejing, and others to lure and sell Chen to Chongming. After Jinchuan and his son found out, they repeatedly negotiated with Shen, but to no avail. The day before yesterday (the 5th), Jinchuan went to Shen's place to demand her return again. Unexpectedly, Shen Duxin and others scolded him and ordered many people to push Jinchuan into the river, causing him to drown. Afterwards, they bribed Township Chief Zhai Yaoting to falsely report to the District Public Security Bureau, claiming that it was a floating body, in an attempt to absolve themselves of guilt. Ji Shenghuai, whose wife was lured and sold and whose father was killed, was filled with grief and indignation. Yesterday (the 6th), he petitioned the county government to arrest the murderers and bring them to justice in order to avenge his injustice.</p>

Wang said that due to the busy political affairs in Beijing, he had already taken the night train back to Beijing at 11 PM last night. Zeng Zhongming and Chu Minyi traveled with him. This newspaper's reporter met with Wang yesterday, who said that he came to Shanghai today (i.e., yesterday) on a weekly holiday specifically for medical treatment. After being diagnosed by Dr. Noel, it was determined that his diabetes had been slightly alleviated. He was treated with a new type of drug and instructed to take the medicine for two weeks, then return to Shanghai for examination and continued treatment in order to recognize the function of this new drug and adjust the amount of application. When the reporter inquired whether he had met with Minister Gu Weijun, who had recently returned to the country, Wang replied that he was busy diagnosing and treating his chronic illness and did not have a meal until 3 PM in the afternoon, so he did not receive any guests. As for Minister Gu, it was agreed that he would take the night train to Beijing on Wednesday (i.e., the 11th) and meet on the 12th in Beijing.</p>

<p>Datong News Agency reports: Li Yanlu, chief of staff and guerrilla commander of General Wang Delin of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, recently disguised himself, boarded the Ping-Shen train, and entered the pass to arrive in Shanghai. A Datong News Agency reporter met with him yesterday morning at a certain location. Mr. Li, besides having already visited the reception center for the families of the Volunteer Army on Julai Road and offering comfort to the received families, will take a boat to Guangdong in the next few days to personally report the military situation on the front lines to General Wang Delin.

<p>According to Mr. Li, "This time, when I boarded the Ping-Shen train to enter the pass, although the time required was not as long as before, which required detours, it was indeed more convenient, but also inevitably dangerous. Moreover, since the road has been closed for a long time, it is even more profound that I was able to board the train and enter the pass. The Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army has not relaxed its determination to resist, but recently, observing the public morale within the pass, it seems to be more depressed than before." Mr. Li continued, "The enemy's atrocities in the Northeast can be described as intensified. They are especially cruel to young intellectuals who are unwilling to be enslaved, even using iron wires to pierce their palms and hanging them from treetops, or pumping air into their anuses (or vaginas for women) to make their bellies bulge and then throwing them to their deaths. Such tragic situations will surely be dismissed by countrymen as alarmist talk, but how can they know that there is indeed another world outside the pass?"</p>

<p>Mr. Li also said, "My mission in entering the pass is to report the recent military situation outside the pass to General Wang Delin.

<p>Chenjia Ridge Station, Muling County, is the garrison of the 18th Regiment of the puppet army, led by Regiment Commander Pei (formerly Battalion Commander Pei in Yanji). On May 3, Chen Rongjiu, commander of the 8th Detachment of our army's guerrillas, led his troops to attack the station. At 12:00 PM, they advanced in three detachments, first surrounding the puppet army's regimental headquarters and cutting off the telegraph lines. They fought fiercely until dawn before retreating. Before the attack, a special service company was temporarily dispatched to collect grain, cloth, and other items, obtaining 97 bags of Japanese-made flour, two Korean cars of rice (about 10+ dan), more than 100 bolts of cloth, over 7,000 rounds of rifle ammunition, three Mauser pistols, and four flintlock guns.

After a two-hour standoff, the puppet army, seeing their unfavorable terrain and unwilling soldiers, retreated, saying, "Please retreat, old generals. You are the army that saves the country. Slaves of the country cannot save the country, nor can they fight those who save the country. Let our dog slave regimental commander do it alone. Old generals, there's no need to risk your lives. Company commanders, let's go!" and throwing down their guns to flee. Captain Li gathered the team and searched the battlefield, obtaining many abandoned guns and ammunition before returning to the team. In this battle, the puppet army lost one platoon leader and two wounded soldiers. Our side had 12 wounded soldiers and no other losses.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Construction Bank Decides to Invest RMB 5.5 Million in the Construction of the Cao'e River Railway Bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to Complete the Entire Line <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports: The China Construction Bank was established on the 4th of this month and is actively carrying out business operations. A Shenshi News Agency reporter learned from banking circles yesterday that the company's first business has been determined to be an investment of RMB 5.5 million in the construction of the Cao'e River Railway Bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Completing the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway: The Construction Bank was originally intended to support construction work and bears a heavy responsibility. It is extremely cautious in terms of investment. The previous rumor that it would invest in the Central Machinery Factory is still under discussion. According to reliable sources in the banking world that the reporter obtained yesterday, the first business after the opening of the Construction Bank has been determined to be an investment in the construction of the Cao'e River Railway Bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. The amount of investment has been agreed to be RMB 5.5 million, with a portion of the operating income of the railway as collateral. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway currently only runs to Hangzhou and from Baiguan to Ningbo. The section in between, from Hangzhou through Xiaoshan and Shaoxing to Baiguan, has not yet been completed. In addition to the Qiantang River Bridge, which has been separately contacted with Shanghai banking circles to borrow funds for construction, the remaining tracks that urgently need to be completed require approximately RMB 10 million. In addition to the RMB 4.5 million that the Sino-British Bank has agreed to reinvest, the remaining RMB 5.5 million will be invested by the Construction Bank.</p>
<p>Constructing the Cao'e River Bridge: At the same time, it is also stipulated that a portion of the funds will be used for the construction of the Cao'e River Bridge. Before the European War, a German company contracted to build the Cao'e River Railway Bridge and had completed part of the base-filling work. Later, due to the outbreak of the war, it was suspended. Reconstructing it this time can save a portion of the project. When the two major bridges, the Cao'e River Bridge and the Qiantang River Bridge, are completed, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and the Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway will be fully connected.</p>
<p>Expanding the Board of Directors and Supervisors: The China Construction Bank has expanded its leased office in the Continental Building on Jiujiang Road to six large rooms to cope with the increased workload after its opening. As for expanding the board of directors by four people and the supervisors by two people, after the shareholders' meeting has resolved and passed it, they are now looking for candidates. As soon as Chairman Kong Xiangxi returns to Shanghai, it can be formally announced.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Dr. Wu Lien-teh Discusses the Meeting of the League of Nations Health Committee: Dr. Rajchman Will Not Come to China This Year, the League of Nations Congratulates China on Its Achievements <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports: After Dr. Wu Lien-teh arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 7th), a representative of the North China Daily News visited him and asked whether Dr. Rajchman would return to China. Dr. Wu could not give a definite answer, but said that Dr. Rajchman would not come to China again this year. Dr. Rajchman's term as Director of the League of Nations Technical Expert Group in China was for one year. Although the term has expired, his position as Health Advisor to the Chinese Ministry of Health will not expire until August of this year. Whether he will be re-appointed will be decided at that time. Dr. Wu then described the meeting of the Geneva Health Committee, saying that the meeting had discussed Chinese affairs for a whole morning. He had submitted a report on the progress of health work in China since 1931, which was divided into four parts: (1) demonstrating the progress of central health undertakings and the Central Hospital in the capital; (2) China's epidemic prevention affairs, focusing on four central points; (3) the situation of cholera in China; (4) the progress of national isolation affairs in the past three years. The four central points of epidemic prevention are Outer Baikal, Tongliao, Shanxi, and Fujian. After 20 years of work, the plague in Outer Baikal has been completely eliminated. Tongliao is now in the hands of the Japanese and cannot be described. After he reported the epidemic prevention situation in Shanxi to the League of Nations Committee, the League of Nations Committee decided to cooperate with China and set up a research center in a certain county in the province. As for Fujian Province, it is heard that there have been outbreaks of plague again this summer. Dr. Wu continued to point out the great progress in controlling cholera epidemics, especially in Shanghai. Few people have died from it recently, mostly due to the people receiving vaccinations and the timely opening of seasonal epidemic hospitals every year. After he submitted the report to the League of Nations Committee, he further informed them that the ninth triennial conference of the Far Eastern Tropical Medical Association was scheduled to be held in Nanjing from October 1st to 10th of this year. All countries in the Far East have been invited to send representatives to China to attend the meeting. The League of Nations Executive Committee has also received this request and has decided to send three medical doctors, Parker, Posyk, and Strangpo, as representatives. Dr. Wu concluded by saying that the League of Nations representatives all congratulated China on the many undertakings completed in a short period of three years. Dr. Rajchman also attended the meeting several times and expressed his observations on overseas health work, especially praising the development of sports in China. Two days later, he submitted a complete report on the League of Nations' technical cooperation with China to the League of Nations Executive Council, which was fully accepted.</p>

<p>The Executive Yuan, based on a proposal by the Ministry of Finance to reduce and exempt various export taxes to promote the development of domestic industries and expand overseas trade channels, issued an instruction to provincial and municipal governments yesterday that no additional taxes or levies should be added in the future. The original order is as follows: It is hereby noted that, according to a proposal previously submitted by the Ministry of Finance to reduce and exempt various export taxes and revise tax rates, the matter was resolved and passed at the 161st meeting of this Yuan, submitted to the 409th meeting of the Central Political Conference, resolved in principle and passed, and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and amendment before being promulgated by the National Government by decree. A clear order has already been issued to all parties to inform them of the matter. It is noted that in recent years, our country's major export commodities have mostly shown a state of stagnation. The reason for this is, of course, the impact of the global economic panic, but high freight rates and heavy taxes and levies are all sufficient to strike a blow to export goods. The Ministry of Finance's proposal to change the tax rates this time is to promote the development of domestic industries, expand overseas trade channels, and reduce the burden on merchants. Since the promulgation of the revised tax rates, the provincial and municipal governments concerned must not increase any additional taxes or levies on the various goods exempt from export tax in the revised plan in the future, in order to conform to the central government's intention to promote industry and show consideration for the difficulties of merchants. In addition to separate orders, it is hereby ordered that they be followed and that all subordinates be instructed to follow suit. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Inland Parcel Tax to Be Levied Uniformly Starting Tomorrow to Prevent Merchants from Taking Advantage and Evading Taxes <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs authorities collect parcel taxes on parcels coming and going by post, assigning personnel to inspect and handle them at the General Post Office. However, inland parcels sent from one inland location to another do not go through the General Post Office, so they are not taxed. As a result, some merchants transport goods from Shanghai to inland post offices near Shanghai for shipment in order to evade taxes. Although the Customs authorities have strictly investigated and prohibited this, it is ultimately difficult to prevent. Now, the Jianghai Customs has repeatedly reported that some merchants are increasingly evading taxes, which is detrimental to commercial transportation. Commissioner of Customs Robert Brooke deeply feels that if this continues without rectification, it will have a profound impact on tax revenue. Therefore, he has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to levy taxes on inland parcels uniformly starting tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Lawyers' Association, General Meeting of Members Fails Again Yesterday <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association has repeatedly convened temporary general meetings of members in order to amend its articles of association and restore the chairman system of the Republic of China in 1927, but all have failed due to the lack of a quorum. At 2:00 PM yesterday (Sunday), a temporary general meeting of members was convened at Lake Society at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road in the Public Concession to discuss amending the articles of association and restoring the pre-1927 chairman system. Members Zhang Shijun, Shen Junru, Hu Jue, Huang Shaochang, Zhang Zhengxue, Mao Yun, Wang Weizhen, Ma Junshuo, Cha Renwei, Zhu Fojiu, Lu Dingkui, Zhao Zuwei, Chen Zhigao, Shi Qinghua, Chen Tingrui, Pan Zhensheng, Qu Yue, Wu Zhengwei, Shan Yuhua, Zhou Shiying, Wu Kaisheng, and others, totaling 137 people, attended. Prosecutor Wang Ren from the Second Special District Local Court and Prosecutor Ouyang Shu from the Shanghai Local Court attended to monitor and guide the meeting. At around 3:00 PM, only about 100+ members had arrived, while the total number of members was 1,095. The quorum of one-quarter was 275 people. Because the number of members present was insufficient for a quorum, the meeting was changed to a discussion meeting. The chairman's office reported the reasons why the meeting could not be held and asked the audience to discuss how to promote the meeting and whether to reconvene it after it cooled down in the autumn. As a result, it was decided to reconvene the meeting after it cooled down in the autumn, and the meeting adjourned at about 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Two Railways Revise Freight Rates for Bulky and Explosive Goods <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The traffic departments of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways issued a notice yesterday to all transfer companies and stationmasters, stating, "For the purpose of notification, the loading and unloading fee rates for bulky and explosive goods are hereby revised, to be implemented from July 10. The loading and unloading fee rates for explosive hazards and bulky goods stipulated in the notice of December 22, 1933, shall be cancelled at the same time. The newly revised price rates are copied and issued herewith for your compliance." The new revised handling rates for bulky explosives are as follows: (1) Bulky goods: Any goods whose weight exceeds 350 kilograms per piece are considered bulky goods. Whether transported by the whole car or less-than-carload, the price is calculated by adding to the normal loading and unloading fee rates. If bulky goods are loaded together with non-bulky goods, the fees must be calculated separately, that is, the bulky pieces are charged according to the bulky goods rate, and the non-bulky pieces are charged according to the non-bulky rate. When calculating the tonnage, the tonnage of the bulky pieces should be converted first (that is, if it is less than one metric ton, it is also calculated as one metric ton), and the tonnage of the bulky pieces should be subtracted from the total car tonnage, and the remainder is the tonnage of the non-bulky pieces (for example, if 30 tons of goods are shipped from the Shanghai North Station in one whole car, and one piece weighs 650 kilograms, then one ton of bulky goods should be charged 40 cents, which is twice the normal rate of 20 cents per metric ton, and 29 tons should be charged 5 yuan and 80 cents for bulky goods loading fees, which is 20 cents per metric ton, 29 tons is 5 yuan and 80 cents. If there are two pieces of 800 kilograms and one piece of 355 kilograms, then two tons of bulky goods should be charged 80 cents for loading fees and 28 tons of non-bulky goods should be charged 5 yuan and 60 cents for loading fees, and so on). (2) Explosives: Those stipulated in pages 127 to 129 of the Freight Classification Table shall be calculated at twice the prescribed ordinary loading and unloading fee rate, regardless of the weight of each piece (for example, if 250 kilograms are shipped from the North Station, one piece, then the loading fee should be 20 cents, two cents for every 50 kilograms, doubled to four cents). (Note) Loading and unloading fees should be calculated according to the weight of the railway freight, but explosives should be charged freight at a minimum of two tons in accordance with the regulations. Now that it has been stipulated that the loading and unloading fee for explosives should be doubled, the rule of charging loading fees at a minimum of two tons no longer applies. (3) If loading and unloading is done with a crane and assisted by workers, it should be calculated according to the prescribed ordinary loading and unloading fee rate.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications stated that there has been no age limit for recruiting messengers, reporters, and telephone operators at various telegraph bureaus. In order to rectify this situation, it instructed various telegraph bureaus in this port yesterday that those who do not meet the age requirements must not be employed. The original order stated: (It is hereby noted that various bureaus and stations recruit messengers, reporters, and telephone operators without any age limit. It is hereby specifically stipulated that in the future, the age of messengers employed for the first time must be between 16 and 32 years old, and the age of reporters and telephone operators must be between 18 and 25 years old.

<p>The Support Association for Workers of British and American Tobacco Factories, scheduled to hold a plenary committee meeting at the Xiaoximen Juvenile Lecture Hall at 5:00 PM yesterday, decided to postpone the meeting to Tuesday (the 10th) at 5:00 PM due to insufficient time to distribute notices, to discuss plans to provide relief to unemployed workers and other matters. In addition, the Strike Committee, because the dispute has been delayed and unresolved, decided, based on the resolution of the 13th Representative Assembly, to send representatives led by Xiao Gengsheng to Nanjing yesterday morning with a written document to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the People's Movement Committee, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the second time. Their goals are: (1) to provide relief to unemployed workers; (2) to order the company to reopen the factory immediately. At the same time, the Strike Committee, because workers have been unemployed for a long time, decided to send representatives to petition for relief at the Support Association meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e125">After Resuming Work, the Yixin Toothbrush Factory Continues to Suspend Work <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Yixin Toothbrush Factory on Manufacturing Bureau Road in Nanshi, since the factory intentionally dismissed worker Liu Boheng, the workers rationally requested the factory to withdraw the order, and the factory closed the factory building, resulting in a work stoppage. The party and government agencies sent personnel to mediate, but to no avail. Yesterday morning, representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters Li Weixiong, the Social Affairs Bureau Zhang Chuqiang, the General Labor Union Gong Yuting, and the Toothbrush Workers' Union Zhu Guan'gen, Zhang Quanyong, Liu Zipei, and others continued to mediate with both parties. The factory agreed to reinstate Liu Boheng, and the labor side was satisfied. Therefore, the superiors immediately advised the workers to resume work, and the matter came to an end. However, one wave subsided, and another rose. Because yesterday was the date for the factory to pay wages, in accordance with Article 6 of the agreement, wages were paid twice a month on the 5th and 20th. Therefore, after work yesterday, the workers went to the factory to collect their June wages. However, the factory's new manager, Dai Zhicheng, avoided meeting them. The workers believed that the factory intentionally violated the agreement, so they convened a meeting and decided to report to the labor union. After receiving the report, the labor union sent representatives Zhu Guan'gen, Liu Zipei, and others to the manager's residence due to the lateness of the hour and negotiated for a long time. However, there was no definite date for the wage issue, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the workers again. They decided to resume work after the wages were paid. The labor union representatives tried their best to persuade the workers, but to no avail. The labor union has reported to the superiors for review.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Municipal Government Bureaus Purchase Chinese-Made Huasheng Fans <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Since the municipal government of this city moved into its new building in the central district, the interior decorations are quite commensurate with the building's architecture. Recently, with the arrival of summer and the oppressive heat, the authorities felt that it was very difficult to work, so they purchased a large number of electric fans produced by the Huasheng Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Factory, no less than several hundred, and distributed them to the Secretariat and the subordinate Land, Social Affairs, Education, Health, and other bureaus. Because the factory has been specializing in manufacturing electric fans for 19 years, its various electric fans have achieved remarkable results and have long been famous at home and abroad, with solid quality, power saving, and durability, and have long been trusted and praised by the public.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Record of the Meeting of the South Shanghai Rent Reduction Association <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The South Shanghai Rent Reduction Association held a joint meeting of the executive committee of its branch associations yesterday at the Association's hall in Yongqing Lane, Minquan Road. Those present included Shao Tinglu, Lin Houfang, Wu Zaitang, Gu Xiayun, Wang Wanzhang, Yang Qiqing, Wu B善, etc. Shen Xinfu presided over the meeting, and Ni Yiguan served as the recorder. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the cases of landlords Zhang Dingxin Soy Sauce Garden and Lei Yushang Pharmacy on Minquan Road, and landlord Shen Xingchu of Sanpin Lane, Da Lin Road, who were requested by the Association to reduce rents to maintain market conditions, and who have successively replied, tentatively agreeing to a 10% reduction, and sending representatives to the Association for consultation on how to handle the matter, it was resolved that the opinions of the tenants should be solicited before further review. (2) The Association's special publication has been published once a week. In addition to mailing over 2,000 copies to various institutions, organizations, schools, and prominent figures in Beijing and Shanghai, how should the remaining copies be distributed to businesses and residents, given the high cost? It was resolved that members should be assigned to distribute them widely. Those willing to assist wholeheartedly should pay a small fee of 2 jiao for printing paper each month and must be given a receipt with the Association's seal. No extra demands are allowed. Because the publication progresses systematically and contains rent reduction information based on reason and legality, both landlords and tenants who are concerned about the market situation and paying attention to rent reduction should have a copy for reference. (3) The rent reduction movement has become unstoppable, and it is inevitable that it will last for a long time, leading to transgressive actions. How should this be prevented? It was resolved that for any request for rent reduction, whether in the name of a branch association or an individual, the Association should submit a written request to the landlord. Before the consultation is resolved, the rent should be deposited in the bank. If the landlord comes to collect the rent, the deposit book must be presented for inspection. However, the Association will not be involved in any rent reduction actions that have not been registered with the Association, whether by a group or individual. Even if a branch association or individual has registered with the Association, if they do not act in accordance with the Association's regulations, they will not be protected. (4) The Association has repeatedly received letters from landlords who find it difficult to comply with rent reduction in practice, generally stating that rents are already difficult to collect due to rent reduction, and they are already low but are being asked to be lowered further. Those who do not rely on rent for their livelihood can console themselves with righteousness, but for those who lack the ability to work or are widowed and rely on this small amount of rent to maintain their livelihoods, it is tantamount to destroying their lives. The wording is sincere. How should this be handled? It was resolved that tenants should not demand rent reductions if the rent has not been increased for more than six years, or if the landlord lacks the ability to work or is widowed and relies on a small amount of property to maintain their livelihood. If the landlord meets the above conditions, the Association will do its best to protect them. (5) The representative of Chengzhi Lane reported that the representative verbally agreed to a reduction of several yuan per month. How should this be resolved in terms of percentage? It was resolved that it should be reviewed after consultation between both parties. (6) The representative of Zhao Fang Lane reported that the landlord had already agreed to a 10% reduction, but the tenant still felt it was too high, leading the landlord to file a lawsuit. The judge instructed both parties not to be stubborn and to go out for reconciliation, but it has not been established yet. How should this be handled? It was resolved to send a letter to the landlord to resolve it with a 15% reduction. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Jiangxi Large Porcelain Factory is About to be Established, Du Chongyuan Will Go to Jiangxi Soon to Start Preparations <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Jiangxi Province plans to build a large-scale machine-made porcelain factory. Since porcelain expert Du Chongyuan personally went to investigate a month ago, the progress of the porcelain factory has become more concrete. Mr. Du once went to the Hunan porcelain clay mining area to test the quality of porcelain clay in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces. After returning to Shanghai, he met and talked with Wu Jiantao, Director of the Jiangxi Department of Finance, who came to Shanghai for the same purpose. They have roughly agreed that Mr. Du had previously planned to organize a purely commercial porcelain factory in Shanghai, and an agreement had been reached. Recently, Jiangxi also decided to change to commercial operation, with the provincial government investing 200,000 yuan as commercial shares and guaranteeing the smooth progress of the business without any resistance. The promoters of the Jiangxi porcelain factory repeatedly urged Mr. Du to go and take charge of everything. It is reported that Mr. Du has agreed and will go after finishing the matters in Shanghai to start preparations.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The License Tax is Transferred to the Municipal Finance Bureau. The Cigarette Exchange Association Held a Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>It has been found that cigarette and alcohol licenses have been paid in two installments over the years. Since 1928, cigarette licenses have been changed to four seasons. Shanghai's Chinese and foreign concessions are adjacent to each other, and the situation is special. Cigarette merchants cannot bear any further burden. A letter was sent to the authorities requesting a flexible solution. The authorities were sympathetic to the difficulties of the merchants, and the payment of the license tax was changed to quarterly, and the amount was changed to half. So far, they have been at peace with each other. The license tax is now ordered by the Ministry of Finance to be transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Government Finance Bureau for continuation. The industry has not understood the truth and has become panicked. Therefore, yesterday (the 8th) at 3 pm, a joint meeting of the executive supervisors was convened and resolved to explain the historical evolution over the years and send a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to request the Municipal Government Finance Bureau to allow the continuation of the usual practice in order to relieve the difficulties of the merchants and ensure the peace of business.</p>
<h3 id="e130">The Invoices of Soda Bottles Are Coming Off, The Inspectors Thought It was Tax Evasion and Detained Them. <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yongfaxiang requests the Industry Association to negotiate and return them.</p>
<p>Yongfaxiang Cigarette Exchange Shop at No. 61 Dalin Road, Xiaoximen, had its soda bottles detained by the Invoice Tax Bureau inspectors because the invoice was coming off due to water. They requested the Cigarette Exchange Industry Association to negotiate for their return. The original letter is recorded below: Dear Sirs, Our shop sells soda and purchases invoices in accordance with the regulations, and affixes them to the bottles for sale. On the 2nd of this month, an inspector from the Shanghai Invoice Tax Bureau came to the store to inspect the soda. The invoices were affixed in full without omission, which was fortunately certified by the police officers of the Second District. However, among the hundreds of empty bottles in stock returned by customers, 112 bottles had fallen off their invoices due to freezing and moisture after opening. The inspector mistakenly thought that it was tax evasion and detained them all, sending them to the bureau to wait for a penalty, etc. The water sold by the factory is purchased by the soda business that originally shipped the goods, who first purchases enough invoices and issues invoices, and then holds the freight receipt of the tax bureau for inspection along the way. Once it arrives at the store, it is immediately entered into the goods source register, then the invoices are affixed to the bottles, and then they are sold. We have asked ourselves and found no errors. Now, we are being detained innocently and forced to be punished, which is really inappropriate. Therefore, we are sending a letter to your association to uphold justice and quickly send someone to investigate in order to clarify the truth. We should ask the authorities to deal with it fairly and return the detained empty bottles in full in order to maintain commercial transport and ensure the peace of business, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The National Products Association Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, Asking it to Correct the Extortion of the Shangbao Tax Bureau, Regarding the Undeserved Deduction of Fines for Yili Soda <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products, regarding the Shangbao Invoice Tax Bureau's harsh treatment of the Yili Soda Company's empty bottle fine, resolved at the eighth joint meeting of the fourteenth session of the executive supervisors yesterday to telegraph the Ministry of Finance and immediately order a correction. The original telegram read: Minister Kong Jun of the Ministry of Finance, according to a letter from member Yili Soda Company of the affiliated association, the member specially sailed the Yili ship on June 30 to welcome and send leaders from all walks of life to Putuo for summer vacation, without taking boat fares, providing meals, and supplying soda. At that time, 20 boxes of this brand of soda were loaded, originally intended to be given to tourists to relieve the heat, and invoices were affixed in accordance with the regulations, and they had been inspected and stamped by the Shangbao Invoice Tax Bureau. Unexpectedly, when the ship returned to Shanghai yesterday morning, the inspector of the bureau falsely accused the 20 boxes of empty bottles loaded on the ship of not having invoices affixed and ordered a fine of 20 yuan. They had no choice but to pay the full amount to the bureau and receive a receipt under duress. Recently, we have heard that the government has abolished exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous fees, and has issued three orders and five applications to relieve the difficulties of merchants. Moreover, the taxation of national products is only once and can be circulated. However, the director of the bureau dared to despise the laws and regulations, extort the people, and act tyrannically and illegally. Therefore, a special letter is sent to request your association to relieve the suffering of the national products industry and ask for relief in order to eliminate corruption, etc. It has been found that the member entertained people from all walks of life to travel to Putuo and gave them soda to drink, and taxes have been paid in accordance with the regulations. However, a fine was imposed for transporting back empty bottles, which not only violates the government's good intentions to exempt exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous fees but also violates the national product's one-item, one-tax system. Invoice harassment has reached its extreme, and the false accusations and harsh fines are extremely painful. In addition to sending a letter to the bureau to exempt the fine, a special telegram is sent to request your Excellency to immediately order a correction in order to maintain national products and relieve the difficulties of merchants, which would be a great virtue. Yu Hede and others, Standing Committee Members of the Fourteenth Session of the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products, respectfully bow and affix their seals.</p>

<p>The meeting began with a report by Chairman Qu Wenliu, which roughly stated that the Bodhi Society had been initiated in the north several times but had not been established. This time, the Panchen Lama specially entrusted this matter during the banquet for guests at the Diplomatic Building, hoping that people in Shanghai would work hard to complete it. The purpose of this society is to communicate between the two schools of Esoteric and Exoteric Buddhism, so it promotes Buddhism and benefits all beings, and serves as the foundation for saving the country and the world, etc. Next, Luo Sang Jianzan, the representative sent by the Panchen Lama, reported on the Panchen Lama's intentions: (1) To bring a copy of the Kalachakra Tantra first, and then gradually bring the Tibetan scriptures in the future; (2) To send Yongzheng Buddha to lecture on the scriptures; (3) To subsidize the funds, first raise 2,000 yuan, and then determine according to the situation. Finally, the charter of the society was discussed and passed. Due to lack of time, the election of standing personnel was changed to be decided by the chairman.</p>

It is now known that the association has collected many kinds of exports for the fifth batch from various provinces, including Suzhou jade, Fujian lacquerware, Jiangxi porcelain, Hunan Gu embroidery, and Suzhou brocade, all of which are the best of their kind. It was originally scheduled to be shipped on the 7th of this month, but because the numbering and packing procedures were quite complicated, it was not shipped. It has now been rescheduled to be shipped by the Dollar Company's President Coolidge on the 17th of this month. However, the quantity is still undetermined.</p>
<h3 id="e139">A Vendetta Occurred at the Tangjiawan Vegetable Market. Zhang Ayou Was Resting in the Shade When He Was Chopped with an Ax, and His Injuries Were Critical, and the Murderer Escaped <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Ayou, a native of Yuyao, lives in Tangjiawan, Nanshi, working as a laborer. Zhang was unable to sleep in his house due to the hot weather. The night before last, he was resting in the shade in the Tangjiawan small vegetable market. He lay on the ground until about 2 am when suddenly several people violently arrived, holding a sharp ax, to the vegetable market and chopped Zhang Ayou hard on the forehead while he was sound asleep. He bled profusely instantly and was unable to speak. Seeing that the purpose had been achieved, the murderers dispersed and fled. Wang Changrong, the police officer of the 17th Squad of the 2nd District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, arrived after learning about it, but the rioters had disappeared without a trace. Only the wounded man was seen covered in blood, on the verge of death. So he sent him to the Shanghai Hospital in Nanshi for treatment by car. According to the doctor's diagnosis, the injuries were very serious, with excessive blood loss, and his life was in danger. It is said that the injured Zhang Ayou secretly reported to the detectives the arrest of Xiao Heshang, Xiao Suzhou, Cai Gui, and others for theft on June 13 of this year, which caused hatred. Yu Ying, the leader of the Detective Team of the 2nd District of the Public Security Bureau, has ordered detective leader Shen Wenda to be responsible for strict investigation and arrest of the fugitives.</p>

<p>A trolleybus No. 161 on Route 18 from Xiejiao to Yuezhou Road, operated by the French Tramway Company, had its front right tire suddenly burst near the North Chujiaqiao in the French Concession at 4:45 pm yesterday. The body of the bus tilted to the right, and the passengers were frightened. Fortunately, no one was injured. After the trolleybus had a flat tire, it could not move forward. The driver notified the company by telephone and sent a craftsman to repair and replace the tire. At about 5:30 pm, the bus was able to run as usual.</p>

<h3 id="e141">A Rickshaw Puller in Gaoqiao Prevented a Public Bus From Driving. The Rickshaw Puller Obstructed the Public Bus From Driving and Was Detained. The Vehicle Traffic Was Temporarily Interrupted Until After 6 PM When it Was Restored. <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The rickshaw pullers in the Gaoqiao area of ​​Pudong clashed with the police officers of the Public Security Bureau yesterday morning over the competition for business with the local public buses, causing the public buses to fail to run and interrupting traffic for several hours. Traffic was not restored until 6:30 pm. The details are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Cause of the accident <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the seaside bathing beach in Gaoqiao, the rickshaw business was quite good. Soon, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities set up a public bus in the area. Because the price was low, fast and stable, the rickshaw industry was considerably affected. The rickshaw pullers were quite dissatisfied with this. Yesterday was Sunday, and the Shanghai Qunyi Gongji Science Society was also testing the water safety belt for the first time in the area, so there were more tourists than in the past. At 11 am yesterday, the city ferry that departed from the Bund Bronze Man Pier in Shanghai reached Gaoqiao. At that time, the rickshaw pullers and the public buses of the Bureau of Public Utilities in Gaoqiao Wharf competed for business, did not obey the order, and went forward to solicit business from the passengers, making it impossible for the public buses in the area to drive. The police officers stepped forward to stop them, but the rickshaw pullers did not comply. The police officers then detained two rickshaw pullers from the Yuelai Rickshaw Company and detained them in the Fourth Branch of the Third District of the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Conflict Situation <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>After this incident, the rickshaw pullers all felt a sense of unity, and were quite angry. So they gathered dozens of companions and went to the front of the public bus station in Gaoqiao, pushing the rickshaws and wheelbarrows they used in front of the bus station to prevent the bus from running. The rickshaw pullers have always hated the bus for hindering their business, so they took this opportunity to make both sides unable to receive tourists. At that time, there were about 50 or 60 vehicles obstructing the road. The time was at 11:45 am, and vehicle traffic was completely interrupted. The tourists were quite tired from traveling back and forth under the scorching sun because the Gaoqiao pier was quite far from the seaside bathing beach, and they all complained.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Each suffered minor injuries <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>However, in order to maintain traffic, the public bus contacted the Fourth Branch of the Third District, and the higher authorities dispatched a squad of police officers from the Water Public Security Bureau, who arrived at the station. At this time, the rickshaw pullers even carried several huge square bricks and placed them in the road to block the bus. The police officers dispersed them, but they did not leave. They pulled out their police batons and carried out the expulsion. The rickshaw pullers rushed forward and punched them with their bare hands. Seeing that the number of police officers was too small, they urgently took out their guns and fired warning shots into the sky. As a result, several people on both sides were injured. At 12:15 pm, the rickshaw pullers retreated, and the disturbance temporarily subsided. However, the rickshaw pullers still stacked their vehicles in the road, and the public buses temporarily stopped traffic to avoid disputes. However, at that time, six or seven rickshaw pullers were arrested and taken to the police station.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Temporary Solution <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, the bus company sent representatives to negotiate with the rickshaw pullers' association. Then, local people came forward to mediate. As a result, the rickshaw pullers automatically cancelled the obstruction to traffic at 6 pm, and the public buses resumed traffic at 6:30 pm. The arrested rickshaw pullers can be expected to be released. Therefore, the tourists who went to Gaoqiao yesterday almost could not return to Shanghai, and they did not arrive at this city until after 8 pm.</p>

<h3 id="e146">The Grand Production of the Bank of China Research Office, the Banking Yearbook, is Published. The Book Contains 2.5 Million Words and is Divided into 15 Chapters. It is Extremely Detailed on Bank Surveys, Regulations, and Statistics. <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Economic Research Office of the General Management Office of the Bank of China has always spared no effort in economic surveys. The various statistics and books compiled have made many contributions to financial and economic issues. Recently, Dr. Zhang Xiaomei, the director of the office, and his colleagues, in view of the fact that the banking industry in our country has always lacked complete and systematic records and statistics, took one year to compile a 1934 National Banking Yearbook for research, which was published on the first of this month. The book contains 2.5 million words, divided into two parts, with a total of 15 chapters and 1,800 pages. It is extremely detailed on the major events of the bank in the past three years, a brief description of the national bank, an overview of the banks in various places, a survey of banking associations, banking regulations, banking statistics, a directory of bank personnel, a bank log, foreign banks, money shops and silver houses, trust companies, silver companies, savings associations, insurance companies, and pawnshops. It can be said to be an unprecedented masterpiece in the banking industry. In order to understand the actual situation of this work, the reporter has extracted the origin and process of the compilation of the Banking Yearbook by the office as follows:</p>
<p>The banking industry in our country has only been developing for 40 years from its germination to the present. Although its achievements cannot be compared with the European and American banking industries with hundreds of years of history, it is still one of the large and new types of enterprises in our country and has attracted the attention of people all over the country. Especially in recent years, the relationship between the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the banking industry has been the focus of researchers. However, due to the complexity of the relationship, the vast scope, and the lack of statistical figures, researchers have no way to start. They have no choice but to use the fragmented information in general newspapers as the basis for their arguments, which often fails to grasp the whole picture. This is what bank scholars deeply feel painful about, and this office has also long been aware of this. However, because this matter is of great importance, it is by no means possible to accomplish it with a small number of human and financial resources, and it cannot be done without a long period of preparation and research. Therefore, starting from 1931, we tried to compile a recent 10-year business overview of national banks, making a systematic analysis and compilation of facts, and publishing it in the Bank of China Monthly, which is published by this office on a regular basis. It was deeply appreciated by people from all walks of life. This office is still not satisfied, so at the beginning of 1932, it selected 26 Shanghai Banking Association member banks with a longer history from the more than 30 banks that had been published, as well as the Central Bank and the Four Bank Savings Association, etc., and reorganized them, adding a brief history, annual, category, notes, index, and charts of each bank, etc., totaling more than 360 pages, which were published at one time, entitled (Research on the Recent 10-Year Business Overview of Important Banks in China), which was published in May 1933. People in the country believed that it was the only reliable data and statistics for studying the banking industry in our country, and they further inquired about how many national banks there were, how much national bank capital there was, how much national bank deposits, loans, and issues there were, and so on. This office felt it difficult to respond and dared not use incomplete and unverified figures to prevaricate. Because we were urged by these questions at the time, we felt that the compilation of the Banking Yearbook could not be delayed any longer, so in June 1933, we formulated the following standards and actively worked:</p>
<p>1. Strive to be suitable for practical use in all aspects.</p>
<p>2. Strive for the most detailed, accurate, and complete records and figures.</p>
<p>3. Set the publication date for June 1934.</p>
<p>From the day the work started to the time the first batch of manuscripts was printed, the time was less than eight months. The compilation method was discussed dozens of times, and more than 10,000 investigation documents were completed to reach the current content. It was due to the concerted efforts of the industry and the assistance of the branches of this bank that the specified standards were not exceeded. Chapters 2, 3, 9, and 11 of this yearbook are the result of directly soliciting completed survey forms from various banks. The forms issued were recognized and assisted by various banks, and they were quickly filled in and returned. If there were any questions, they were also explained in detail, which the editors are very grateful for. Furthermore, the financial institutions in various places must be directly surveyed every year. If personnel are sent for on-site surveys, it is really not allowed due to economic and time constraints. Fortunately, the branches of this bank are all over the provinces, so we used the original communication network of the branches in various places to conduct direct surveys. Chapters 5, 10, and 15 of this yearbook are the result of the efforts of the branches, which are also deeply appreciated by this office. However, due to the short time, the staff members were busy with affairs, and the compilation methods were not good, the statistics were not prepared, the proofreading was not thorough, and the material was not properly selected. It is unavoidable, and everything depends on the readers' corrections and supervision in order to supplement it year by year and reach a state of perfection. This is what the staff of this office especially looks forward to, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Zhou Juemin Invented, the Water Safety Belt Trial Was Successful, All Sectors Considered it Satisfactory After the Trial in Gaoqiao Yesterday <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The water safety belt invented by Mr. Zhou Juemin of the Shanghai Qunyi Gongji Science Society has now been successfully manufactured. A public trial was held at the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach in Pudong at 5 pm yesterday, and the results were good. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e148">Successful Creation <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>This water safety belt is the only invention of Mr. Zhou's life. After many years of research, he finally succeeded. Its shape is similar to that of a life buoy, but there is a protruding part for storing medicine. One end uses a rubber tube to hold medicine powder. It has been reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Industry and has been registered as a patent.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Instructions for Use <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>This belt is shaped like a vest. Put your head into the hole, and tie the lower belt tightly behind your back. You can quickly crush the medicine pack in the back of the vest to mix it. Then, bravely jump into the water to make the entire vest wet. At this time, the medicine in the vest will suddenly vaporize. Within five or six seconds, the whole body will immediately float to the surface of the water. The entire vest will inflate, keeping you safely afloat. Use your feet to propel yourself towards the shore to wait for rescue. If you are far from the shore and there is no one to rescue you, and you stay in the water for a long time, gradually feeling that the air in the vest is insufficient and the buoyancy is decreasing, you can take the rubber tube on the vest, put it in your mouth, pinch the spring clip with one hand, loosen the rubber tube, and blow air into it to replenish it. After the air is full, release your hand, and the rubber tube will still be clamped, preventing air from leaking. Continue to do this, and you will never sink, waiting for rescue. It is indeed the only preventive device on the water.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Yesterday's Test <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 5:00 PM, a test was held at the Gaoqiao seaside bathing beach. News media and people from all walks of life were invited in advance, so many people arrived at the time. First, the testers Yu Binqi, Cai Shengmiao, Zhang Bin, Yang Hanzhi, Wang Fubin, Wu Wenhao, Wang Feilong, Xu Zhongqiang, Xu (photographed by Gong Shugui of the Asia East Agency)</p>
<p>Zhongzhi, Yang Jisi, Shi Guiying, Shi Genfu, Shi Changgen, and more than ten others took the belts into the water, crushed the powder, and soon all floated on the surface of the water, remaining unchanged for a long time. Those who saw it were amazed. The test was completed at 6:00 PM. Mr. Zhou plans to widely market it to all sectors of society and win glory for national products.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Intermodal Transport Between Ningbo, Shanghai and Chuanshan to Start on the 12th of this Month, Starting with Passengers <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo-Chuanshan highway has been built, and long-distance buses are already running. To facilitate the round trip of passengers between Shanghai and Chuanshan, the bus company has sent representatives to Shanghai to discuss with the Ningbo-Shaoxing Merchants Shipping Bureau the establishment of an intermodal transport plan. A contract has been signed and is about to be implemented. The general situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Issuing Through Tickets: The Shanghai-Ningbo-Chuanshan intermodal transport is limited to passengers and luggage traveling to and from these three ports. In Shanghai, the Xin Ning Shao Xing and Xin Jiang Tian steamships have been designated as the transport vessels for intermodal transport. Through tickets will be sold by the Merchants Shipping Ningbo-Shaoxing Shipping Bureau on behalf of the bus company, and by the road bureau on behalf of the company in Chuanshan. Detailed rules have also been established for the consignment of passenger luggage to ensure that travelers have no trouble and enjoy various conveniences.</p>
<p>Free Pick-up: Regardless of whether passengers are traveling from Shanghai to Chuanshan or from Chuanshan to Ningbo and then to Shanghai, the long-distance bus company will send special small steamships to pick up passengers at the Xin Jiang Tian and Xin Ning Shao Xing wharves. All those with through tickets are entitled to free rides on the small steamships. Special commissioners will be assigned to transport luggage on behalf of passengers.</p>
<p>Soon to be Implemented: This plan has been agreed upon by both parties and will be implemented starting on the 12th of this month. The Ningbo-Chuanshan Long-Distance Bus Company has sent the proposed plan to the Shanghai Shipping Company. Once it is approved, a public announcement will be made in the newspapers in Shanghai and Ningbo to inform passengers in Shanghai, Ningbo, and Chuanshan.</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Gonghe Steamship of the Public and Harmony Company Experienced a Mishap; Fire Extinguished After Reaching Shanghai Yesterday; Loss of Goods to be Inspected Today <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Gonghe steamship of the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yangtze River Line, which was sailing from Hankou to Shanghai, experienced a fire in the rear cargo hold on the afternoon of the 7th while sailing on the Yangtze River near Qixia Mountain upstream of Zhenjiang. Smoke was seen coming out of the cargo hold, and the crew immediately reported it to the ship's owner, who immediately ordered the hatch door to be sealed to prevent ventilation and avoid major danger. At the same time, the ship's personnel were ordered to do their best to extinguish the fire in the cargo hold, and the passengers on board were reassured.</p>
<p>Departed from Zhenjiang for Shanghai: When the ship arrived in Zhenjiang, it stopped as usual to load cargo. The cargo hold where the fire broke out had been sealed and suppressed with inert gas so that it could rush to Shanghai to open the hold for rescue. Some of the passengers on board had disembarked in Zhenjiang, and some had changed to trains to come to Shanghai. After the Gonghe steamship finished loading and unloading in Zhenjiang, it immediately set sail downstream to Shanghai at full speed. At the same time, the ship's owner telegraphed the Shanghai office to prepare fire-fighting boats to open the hold and spray water to extinguish the fire when the ship arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Rescue in Donggou: After the ship rushed back to Shanghai yesterday morning, it berthed in Donggou (opposite the Guanghua Petroleum Company wharf). The Shanghai head office had informed the Fire Brigade, which dispatched two fire boats to Donggou Xiaosha to spray water to extinguish the fire on the Gonghe steamship. Firefighters from the two boats boarded the ship and opened the hatch boards where the fire broke out to fight the fire. From morning to 5:00 PM, the fire was finally extinguished. In addition to being burned, the goods loaded in the cargo hold were also soaked in water, resulting in heavy losses. Fortunately, the other cargo holds were separated, so the impact was minimal.</p>
<p>Inspection Today: At 6:00 PM yesterday, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. dispatched a small boat to Donggou to tow the Gonghe steamship back to Hongkou and moor it at the Gonghexiang wharf because the fire had been extinguished. All the goods burned by the fire and the water-soaked goods will have to be unloaded today and inspected by a surveyor to determine the losses before handling matters such as water damage assessment. Whether the ship's hull was damaged and how the fire started still needs to be investigated.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Jianghai Customs Seized Smuggled Goods; Crew Members Were All Japanese and Taiwanese <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs recently seized two diesel engine vessels similar to fishing boats in the Huangpu River. One was loaded with 400 bales of artificial silk, and the other was loaded with 100 bales of artificial silk and a large amount of flour and sugar, etc. The value is probably over 500,000 yuan. They attempted to evade taxes. The crew members were all Japanese and Taiwanese. Jianghai Customs has confiscated the smuggled goods and the two motor vessels, and the crew members have been released. It is said that the customs plans to auction the confiscated motor vessels.</p>
<p>Continental News reports: On June 29th and 30th, the customs patrol vessel Lianxing seized two Japanese motor fishing boats smuggling goods outside Wusongkou. The amount of smuggled goods seized was unprecedented in recent customs history, including 500 bales of artificial silk worth more than 500,000 yuan, as well as a large amount of flour and sugar. It is said that all have been confiscated. The two fishing boats are equipped with large diesel engines and have been escorted to Shanghai. They were initially moored near the Pudong Water Police Station and then moved to the riverside near Weituoma in Shanghai, guarded by personnel from the Chinese Water Police Bureau. One of the fishing boats carries Japanese crew members and Taiwanese laborers, none of whom carry any passport documents. The two ships have the same structure and are equipped with oil engines, estimated to have a speed of more than 15 nautical miles per hour. The artificial silk carried is clearly intended to be smuggled into Shanghai and is now being unloaded from the ships, one carrying 400 bales and the other carrying 100 bales. It is still unclear whether the two ships sailed from Dalian or Taiwan yesterday. However, it is heard that after the people on board were taken ashore, they were all released because the smuggling of silk goods can only result in the confiscation of the goods or ships, or the imposition of fines, unlike the smuggling of opium and other items, which can lead to imprisonment. Therefore, there is no legal basis to punish the crew members of these two ships. It is now believed that the two ships departed from Dalian, costing around 8,000 to 10,000 taels each. They will probably all be auctioned by the customs for people to bid on.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Happiness Turns to Sorrow: Zhang Wensheng Dies from Exhaustion; Lover Flees in Fear; Illegal Hotel Under Investigation <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Wensheng, a 45-year-old man from Dongtai, Jiangbei, residing at No. 56, 40 Jiantou, Rue du Pere Froc, French Concession, was tall and obese. He worked as a servant in a mansion. He had a wife, Ms. Chen, 38 years old, a son and two daughters, and an elderly mother at home. However, Zhang still had a strong liking for women and often frequented brothels. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, Zhang met his lover, Ms. Zhang, 26 years old, near the Xiaocai Market in Baxianqiao. She was carrying a basket and scales to buy vegetables at the market. Upon seeing her, Zhang took her to the Yuandan Inn at No. 13 Huagequan Road, where he used the alias Wang Ar'er, 38 years old, from Zhenjiang. Upon entering the inn, without paying the room fee, he took the woman upstairs and ordered the tea boy to open room number two. They then closed the door to engage in intercourse. Unexpectedly, during this hot weather, Zhang, due to physical weakness and exhaustion, opened his essence gate and spilled all over the bed. Ms. Zhang was anxious and feared that making a fuss would be detrimental to her. She put on her clothes, took the vegetable basket and scales she brought, and pretended to be calm as she went downstairs, claiming that she was in a hurry to buy vegetables and fled. The tea boy waited downstairs for several minutes and did not see Zhang come down. He went upstairs to check and collect the room fee. The tea boy, Wu Axin, entered the room and saw Zhang lying on the bed, frothing at the mouth. When asked, he could not open his mouth to answer and was already on his last breath. The tea boy was greatly shocked and mistakenly thought that he was suffering from acute cholera. He informed the innkeeper and hired a rickshaw to send Zhang to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road for treatment. After the doctor examined him, he was diagnosed with exhaustion and no pulse and refused to admit him. Zhang, while sitting in the rickshaw, also died at that moment. The tea boy and others who accompanied him planned to send the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for a post-mortem examination and requested acceptance before reporting to the police. On the way, it was discovered by Chinese Constable No. 574 and taken to the Meilan Police Station at the Grand Clock. Detectives were sent to carry the body into the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for a post-mortem examination and to summon the family to the case. The court was requested to send someone to examine the body today. It is heard that the police are investigating the owner and tea boy of the Yuandan Inn for allowing prostitution during the day, which violates the regulations, and have summoned them to the case for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Trial of the Service Staff Fraud Case at the Sixth District Third Branch; Extorting 210 Yuan for Investigating Opium; Witnesses Testify in Court About the Incident <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Mei Liujiang, a villager from Meilong Town in the suburbs of Shanghai, used to be in the rice business. In recent years, due to his old age, he has been unemployed at home. He has a habit of smoking opium. He spends his free time lying on a couch at home. This was discovered by Liu Yin, a service staff member from the police station of the Sixth District Third Branch in the town. On May 28th, he led the police to Mei Liujiang's house, claiming to search for prohibited items such as red pills and morphine. As a result, nothing was found. Afterwards, the town spread rumors that the service staff member was engaged in fraud, and the local people submitted a complaint to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, accusing Liu Yin of illegal activities and extortion. After receiving the report, Director Wen believed that the matter concerned the reputation of the police and that the truth should be thoroughly investigated. He summoned Liu Yin to the case and sent a letter to the prosecutor's office of the local court for investigation. Prosecutor Lei interrogated him and ordered him to be detained, and also summoned Mei Liujiang and others.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Repeated Investigations <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Mei Liujiang was released on bail, and the case was prosecuted in the criminal court for public trial. The previous morning, Judge Sun Jikang held an open trial in the Fifth Court and ordered the detained Liu Yin to be brought to the case. Liu Yin confessed that he was a service staff member at the Meilong Town Police Station of the Sixth District Third Branch. On May 26th, he was ordered to go to Mei Liujiang's house to search for drugs such as red pills and morphine. At that time, he led police officers Zhao Bingwen, Luo Ren, and Li Shuangying to search, but no prohibited items were found, nor was there any extortion. Zhao Bingwen then testified that he was a police chief at the Meilong Town Police Station. On that day, he was ordered by the service staff member to lead Luo and Li to Mei Liujiang's house to search. Service staff member Liu ordered me to go and call Mei Jinchun and Mei Hongyuan to go to Mei Liujiang's house together. When I went to call them and arrived at the entrance of Mei Liujiang's house, I only saw many people.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Crowded at the Entrance <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>So I did not go in. Not long after, the service staff member came out, having found nothing, and returned to the station. Mei Liujiang testified that he was 63 years old, from Shanghai, and lived in Meilong Town. He had a son and a daughter. He used to be in the rice business, but now he is old and sick. He does not deny smoking opium, but he only smokes a few times a month when he is ill, and he has not smoked for more than a month now. (Question) Did the police find anything during the search? (Answer) What they found was an opium pipe, a jar of ashes, and five opium stems. (Question) What day was that? (Answer) In the afternoon of May 28th, four people came and said they were investigating the household registration. After they found the opium paraphernalia, they said that this was a prohibited item and wanted to take me away. Later, Mei Jinchun acted as a guarantor. At that time, they did not say they wanted money. At 8:00 PM that night, Liu Yin came and said that Director Wu Zhengding wanted to fine you 400 yuan. I replied that I had no money. He said that if I did not have a penny, the whole family would be taken away. Later, my wife said that she would take out some money. I agreed to pay 40 yuan, but he did not agree.

<p>It was reduced to 210 yuan. At that time, because there was no cash, we agreed to pay the money at Mei Hongyuan's house at 2:00 PM the next day. Liujiang borrowed 80 yuan in banknotes and 20 yuan in coins from me. Liujiang asked Liu Yin for a receipt, but Liu said there was no receipt. Liu took out a slip of paper and told him to write according to it, that there were no red pills or morphine and that there were no losses in my house.

At 12:00 AM, Liu Yin brought the police again and went to Mei Liujiang's house again. As a result, they agreed to pay 210 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<p>To pay, we agreed to pay the money the next day. A total of 190 yuan in banknotes and 260 jiao in coins were paid. Liu took out a draft of a slip of paper from his side and said to write a piece of paper so that everyone could be safe in the future. This paper was written by me on behalf of him. I am the platoon leader of the town's security regiment. The facts are like this and there is no falsehood, etc. Witness Mei Diqing testified that he was 59 years old and in the rice and grocery business. At 7:00 or 8:00 AM on May 29th, Mei Liujiang came and said he had gotten into trouble and borrowed 100 yuan in foreign currency from me to pay the fine. He also borrowed 100 yuan from Mei Jinchun. Mei Liujiang himself took out 10 yuan, totaling 210 yuan. (Question) Is there an IOU? (Answer) We are uncle and nephew and have always had dealings, so there is no IOU, etc. Li Shuangying testified that he was a policeman at the police station. (Question) Did you go to the search?

<p>Prohibited items. (Question) Were Mei Hongyuan and others on the scene? (Answer) They were on the scene. After hearing this, Mei Hongyuan testified again that the guarantee was written by Luo Ren. Later, Liu Yin discarded the guarantee in the spittoon. After Liu left, we took the guarantee out of the spittoon and took a photo of it. We can present it to the case next time. The interrogating official asked Liu Yin again, what do you say? Liu replied that they were all of the same clan, or were uncles and nephews, and this kind of testimony was not credible. As for Mei Hongyuan, because he was the platoon leader, I asked him to go with me, etc. The interrogating official asked Prosecutor Lei to come to the court to argue the case, and believed that the debate was over. The sentence was scheduled to be pronounced on the morning of the 13th. He also asked Mei Liujiang, you have already been prosecuted for smoking opium, what else do you have to say? He replied, I request to attach a civil lawsuit to return the 210 yuan in foreign currency. The official ordered Liu Yin to be taken back into custody, and Mei Liujiang was still released on bail. Then the court adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Two Pudong Newspapers Sued; The Xin Pudong Bao and the Pudong Xing Bao Cause a Disturbance for Publishing a Gambling Case in Zhoupu <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Pudong Bao has been published for many years and is known for its fair opinions. It is particularly sensitive and accurate in reporting news from villages and towns in Pudong. However, it has always criticized and condemned不良 events such as opium and gambling in rural areas, without any favoritism. A Tongxing Clothing Store in Zhoupu, due to its sluggish business and high expenses, opened a secret gambling den in its store as another way to make money to make up for the losses. It attracted gamblers and opened the den after closing the market every yesterday. The winnings and losses were huge, and the store enjoyed the benefits of collecting commissions. As time went on, it gradually leaked out. The Xin Pudong Bao revealed its secret on May 27th, publishing a news story about the store opening a gambling den and collecting commissions, with the headline "Gambling Den Set Up Inside Tongxing Clothing Store". However, the store owner Ni Qiusheng insisted on denying it and sent a letter to the newspaper requesting a correction. However, the newspaper believed that the report was indeed a fact and refused his request. It continued to publish the inside story of the gambling den, stating that a gambler surnamed Shen was playing mahjong in the gambling den one day and drew a set of three yuan cards. Among them, the white board had already been "ponged" out. Er'er (named Zhang Aichun, the owner of the local Gongheyuan Restaurant), who was watching, suddenly said, "This set of cards may not be able to win." Shen believed that this remark was tantamount to giving a warning, so after the game ended, he hosted a banquet for people from all walks of life in Zhoupu and announced the inside story of the clothing store setting up a gambling den to collect money on the spot. He also implicated Jin Dongsheng of the Delongmao Meat Shop and Qiu Jinsheng of the Zhoupu Watermelon Shop. The Pudong Xing Bao also published a news story titled "Gambling Case in Zhoupu" on May 28th. Ni, Zhang, Jin, and Qiu hired lawyers to file criminal self-suits against the chief writers of the two newspapers, Qu Wuyong and Tang Mengwu, in the First Special District Local Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan summoned them for interrogation. Tang Mengwu did not appear, but Qu Wuyong surrendered himself and stated that the Xin Pudong Bao had another person in charge and that he only occasionally wrote commentaries. Moreover, the newspaper was not for sale and its reports were always very cautious, etc. The court then decided to postpone the hearing.</p>

<p>Gao Xiaochen (named Quanzhong), formerly the garrison commander of Xiamen and a native of Xuzhou, and Tao Jiayao, formerly the governor of Jiangxi Province and a native of Gan, had a debt dispute in Japan concerning the late Xu Guoliang, former head of the Shanghai Municipal Police. Gao hired a lawyer and filed a criminal lawsuit against Tao in the Special No. 2 Court, accusing him of fraud. Tao, feeling aggrieved by the sudden accusation despite having cleared the matter, filed a countersuit accusing Gao of false accusation.</p>
<p>While the countersuit was being heard, Gao, enraged by Tao's insulting remarks in court, assaulted Tao on the stairs inside the courthouse after the adjournment, causing him to vomit blood. Tao then filed an assault charge against Gao. After trial, Gao was sentenced to six months in prison for assault. Later, through mediation by friends, Tao compensated Gao 4,000 yuan, and Gao withdrew his lawsuit, settling the matter, as reported in previous issues. However, Gao, dissatisfied with the original sentence in Tao's assault case against him, hired lawyers Xiang Xun and Liu Cailiang to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The Third Branch, after summoning witnesses and holding a court hearing, concluded that the evidence of the appellant's assault was conclusive. The court announced its verdict the day before yesterday, rejecting Gao Xiaochen's appeal and granting him a two-year suspended sentence. Thus, this high-profile case of a garrison commander assaulting a provincial governor and their mutual accusations came to an end.</p>

<p>On July 7th, I read in the "Local News" section of your newspaper that the 15th meeting of the Ship Collision Handling Dispute Committee of the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, chaired by Penghu, continued to discuss the case of the Yuxing Wheel colliding with and sinking the Shao Genggen civilian boat in the Huangpu River. The meeting questioned Tang Yinguo, the deputy of the Longmao small wheel, and Ling Zhaoji, the captain of the Yuxing Wheel, and (resolved) that the Shao Genggen civilian boat should bear 60% of the responsibility for the negligence, and the Yuxing Wheel should bear 40% of the responsibility for the negligence.</p>
<p>After reading this, I was very surprised. The case of Shao Genggen's rice boat being hit and sunk by the Yuxing Wheel in the Huangpu River around 2:00 PM on May 7th, and his wife Shao Guizhen tragically drowning and dying, has been inspected and verified by the Shanghai Local Court, and after questioning and investigation, it was deemed that a public prosecution should be filed and transferred to the Criminal Court for public judgment. We should wait quietly for the judgment according to law. As for the private claim for damages, it has already been entrusted to my lawyer, Te Quan, to act as an agent, requesting a judgment for payment.</p>
<p>On June 16th, Shao Genggen again commissioned my lawyer to publish a notice in the Shen and Xin newspapers, stating that the signature was invalid, denying mediation as uneasy, and advocating for a solution according to law. The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau's Ship Collision Handling Dispute Committee had previously unreasonably requested twice to publish a correction in the newspaper. My lawyer only knows to speak law in law, and knows nothing else, so he once replied and did not allow it. Your newspaper's "Local News" section yesterday (July 7th) reported the situation of the 15th meeting of the Ship Collision Committee, knowing that the committee failed to thoroughly investigate the facts of the case and its course of events, and used the partial statements of Tang, the deputy of the Longmao small wheel related to the Xingyu Wheel, and Ling Zhaoji, the captain of the Xingyu Wheel, as the standard for the committee's resolution. This is a lack of fairness in the meeting system, and it is clear that the decision was made with suspicion, intending to involve the legal effect.</p>
<p>In addition to presenting the facts of the case to the Control Yuan and the Ministry of Communications for investigation and handling according to law, in order to emphasize civil life, I will again request your newspaper to publish the original letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column, in order to correct the truth of the case and avoid confusing the facts, I am deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>[Addressed to] Local News Editorial Department of Shen Bao Newspaper</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>My client, Jia Li, took her two nieces from Xinzha Road to Dongxinqiao by the No. 3 tram around 8:00 AM on the 7th of this month. Originally, she was going to the West Tibet Road Epidemic Hospital to see her brother-in-law's illness. When they arrived at Dongxinqiao Station, the ticket seller and driver saw that she was a woman, poor and weak, and urged her to leave quickly. Ms. Jia was unable to resist, so she and her nieces got off the bus. One of the nieces, Li Fengfu (also known as Hongfu), was only four years old, and the other was only eight months old and still in swaddling clothes. At this time, the older child got off first, and just as she landed, the ticket seller rang the bell, and the driver, seeing that Ms. Jia and her nieces had not completely got off the bus, hurriedly turned the wheel, causing a tragedy. She died of her injuries around 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the same day.</p>
<p>We have already reported the facts to the Lao Zha Police Station and requested verification. Yesterday, I read the news reports, and except for the Shen Bao, which was more detailed, most of them did not match the facts. My lawyer's duty lies, I have to send a special letter to inform you, please correct it, so that the truth can be clarified, it is extremely grateful, it is extremely grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>[Addressed to] Local News Editorial Department of Shen Bao</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e179">Relative Truth and Absolute Truth - Answer to Messrs. Tian Zhao, Yin Jishan, et al. - (Continued) <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Even the simplest truth, like death, may seem self-evident to us. However, primitive hunting societies, due to limitations in their social practices, may not have a complete understanding of it. Therefore, more complex and profound truths are even more subject to practical limitations. Relative truth is a necessary stage in the process of people approaching absolute truth. Each relative truth is only a part of absolute truth. Absolute truth is multifaceted, while relative truth is one aspect of it. Human understanding gradually approaches absolute truth through the process of relative truth. Therefore, understanding is also a kind of movement. Truth is not fixed in human minds. The things reflected in truth gradually unfold like an active film. Each frame represents a part of the entire movie, and the entire movie is composed of these many parts. Therefore, absolute truth is the sum, total, or conclusion of relative truths.</p>
<p>In this way, we can know that there is an inseparable relationship between relative truth and absolute truth. Without relative truth, absolute truth cannot be reached. Without absolute truth, relative truth has no conclusion. Old philosophy, especially idealistic philosophy, completely denied relative truth when advocating absolute truth, believing that absolute truth could be reached suddenly, without having to gradually understand it through practice. However, once separated from practice, one cannot help but replace the truth of reality with fantasy, resulting in dogmatism and idealism, which is wrong. As for those who advocate relative truth, they only pay attention to immediate empirical evidence and do not believe that truth can be used to infer future things. They only pay attention to the present and do not trust future results, which will lead to skepticism. However, in fact, truth can predict the future. A truth in science will never deceive us. Those who advocate only relative truth, in fact, ignore the value of science, which we naturally want to oppose.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that relative truth has the possibility of developing into absolute truth, as has been said before. And absolute truth itself is by no means completely fixed. Once the things we understand increase, we can make the absolute truth we have reached richer and more concrete, making it a higher absolute truth. The universe is infinitely diverse in all aspects, and the development of truth is also infinite. Compared with the infinitely diverse universe, the absolute truth we have reached is still a relative and incomplete thing. It only has absolute and complete meaning in a certain stage of our practice. The more practice develops, the richer the content of absolute truth will be, and the higher the value of its truth will be.</p>

<p>At the Same Time, He is Also a Student, Which is Extremely Ridiculous</p>
<p>(Changchun, Northeast News) In order to deceive the people of Northeast China, the brutal Japanese must start with their puppet ruling class. Therefore, the Japanese instigated the puppet to establish a so-called "Manchurian-Mongolian Noble Children's School," named "Wei Cheng School." Puyi will serve as the (principal), and the Japanese Oohashi will be his (head of education). According to the plan, although Puyi is the principal, he will also be a university student of the pseudo-school. That is, Puyi must attend classes at the pseudo-school for 12 hours a week to study Japanese. The brutal Japanese have implemented various ridiculous measures in Northeast China, which are hateful but also laughable.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Ministry of Finance to Order All Provinces and Cities to Establish Schools to Train Tax Officials <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>To Cultivate Basic Talents and Thoroughly Reform Finance</p>
<p>Students Admitted Must Have Graduated from Junior High School</p>
<p>In order to create basic talents for financial administration personnel and thoroughly reform finance, the Ministry of Finance initiated the establishment of schools in various provinces and cities to train basic financial talents. The method has now been finalized and can be ordered to the financial bureaus of various provinces to follow. The reporter from the Daily News found out the details of the implementation of the school's establishment and has recorded them as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e182">Establishing Schools <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance believes that the improvement of finance lies in the goodness of legislation, and even more in the strength of its implementation. However, due to the changes in social economy and the adoption of new budget laws, the old-fashioned money and grain practices are no longer suitable. There is a great lack of newly arrived talents. In recent years, the authorities of various provinces have either used examinations to select true talents or established schools to train them. However, their purpose is mostly for middle-level and above financial personnel, and there are no examinations or training for lower-level personnel. As a result, matters such as investigation, collection, and disbursement of finance in various counties are still controlled by the old-fashioned clerks. Government measures are sometimes delayed under the pretext of training, not implemented, or superficially complied with, temporarily decorated. In severe cases, they hinder the officials and obstruct the new mechanism. The failure to thoroughly clean up the finance is really one of the reasons. Now, the finances of various provinces and cities are striving for clarification. If the management of books, the collection of taxes, and the compilation of accounting statistics are not changed to be handled by specially trained and qualified personnel, but are still entrusted to the old-fashioned clerks who are unlearned and unprincipled, it will be difficult to achieve good results. In order to thoroughly reform finance, it is urgent to train these lower-level financial personnel to meet the current needs of reform.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Proposed Methods <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>(1) The financial bureaus of various provinces and cities should establish schools to train basic financial talents as soon as possible. In order to save expenses, they may encourage groups or private individuals to establish schools, provide them with convenience, and help them develop. (2) The student admission qualifications for this type of school should be limited to junior high school graduates, or those with equivalent qualifications, or those who have served in society for a certain number of years. (3) The curriculum should be practical, such as financial laws and regulations, tax laws and regulations, accounting and statistical laws and regulations, and the financial and economic situation of the province, all of which should be taken as important subjects. (4) Moral education should focus on cultivating civic morality, developing labor habits, and inspiring a spirit of service, so as to improve their skills and enhance their personality. (5) After graduation, students should be screened and employed by the financial bureau. All agencies in the province and city that need tax collectors, accountants, statisticians, etc., should designate and assign them from the previously trained and qualified personnel.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Results of the Zhejiang High School Graduation Examination Announced <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The results of the Zhejiang Province High School Graduation Examination for this year have been reviewed by the examination committee members. According to the score calculation results, 252 students passed all subjects and are allowed to graduate, including 12 students with a grade of A, 181 students with a grade of B, and 59 students with a grade of C. 89 students failed one or two subjects and are allowed to participate in the next examination for those subjects. 30 students failed three or more subjects and are required to repeat the grade and participate in the examination. 5 students who failed to complete three or more subjects due to illness or other reasons should participate in the full examination in the next session. 6 students who failed the school graduation examination should send the make-up exam results for review. In addition, 4 students who participated in this year's examination and passed the make-up examination for the second and third graduation examinations are allowed to graduate. The first place in the individual category is Jiang Yimei from Ningbo Middle School, and the first place in the group category is Ningbo Xiaoshi Middle School.</p>
<h3 id="e185">The Committee for the Examination of Books and Magazines Hosted the Publishing Industry Yesterday, Announcing the Revised Examination Methods <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Committee for the Examination of Books and Magazines of the Central Propaganda Committee has been established in Shanghai for a month. In order to make the publishing industry understand the significance of the central government's establishment of this committee, the committee hosted a tea party for the publishing industry at Yipinxian Hall at 4:00 PM yesterday. Zhang Guangyu, Fu Donghua, Ma Guoliang, Liang Desuo, Zhang Yiping, Du Chongyuan, Xia Mianzun, Yao Mingda, Chen Lin, Zhao Jingshen, Li Bojia, Lou Pengnian, Li Zhiyun, Zhang Jinglu, Xu Yuyuan, Fang Dongliang, Wang Zicheng, Wang Yuanfang, Zhao Nangong, Yu Songhua, Gao Pengtian, Ji Zhizhong, Shen Junsheng, Wu Liande, Zheng Wuchang, Sun Shimin and other responsible persons of various bookstores and social organizations attended, totaling more than 50 people. Fang Zhi (Secretary of the Central Propaganda Committee), Li Songfeng (Director of the Police Department of the Ministry of Interior), Pan Gongzhan (Director of the Municipal Education Bureau), and members Sun Dezhong, Xiang Deyan, etc. reported on the organization and operation of the committee. The details are described as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e186">Chairman Fang Zhi Reported <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>First, Fang Zhi reported, saying, "I am very grateful for your presence at the reception today. There are many books and magazines published in Shanghai, and the authors are also gathered in Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai is the cultural center of the country. The publishing industry's efforts to improve culture will be assisted by the authorities. However, the authorities must impose penalties on the improper books in accordance with the law. However, the publishing industry has repeatedly requested to find a way to remedy the great loss caused by deletions, revisions, or detentions after distribution. After repeated consideration, the deletion, revision, or detention loss is quite large. Therefore, the committee organized this association in Shanghai to conduct preliminary review of manuscripts, so as to avoid losses such as detention and prohibition after publication. The committee will review the manuscripts submitted to the committee quickly and will not delay the publication time. Although the committee is located in Shanghai, it is actually a central government agency. This point should also be explained to you."</p>
<h3 id="e187">Li Songfeng and Others' Report <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Li Songfeng then reported, roughly stating that according to the detailed rules for the implementation of the Publication Law, the review of original manuscripts should have been carried out long ago. Now, all the methods of the committee established by the central government are based on the Publication Law and the detailed rules for its implementation. He hoped that in the future, the publishing industry would, in accordance with the law, submit original manuscripts of literary, artistic, and social science books and periodicals to the committee for review. Pan Gongzhan reported, roughly stating that since the establishment of the committee, many parties have submitted manuscripts for review in accordance with the law, but there are still some who have not. He attributed the reasons to two points: first, some people are still unaware of this matter due to the transfer of official documents; second, some are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The committee has now revised the review methods and hopes that the publishing industry can cooperate effectively with the committee. If submissions are not made in the future, penalties will be imposed in accordance with the law. Sun Dezhong and Xiang Deyan reported, roughly stating that the central government's requirement for the review of publications is for the sake of the nation's future and social thought. They hoped that writers and the publishing industry would, from this standpoint, cooperate effectively with the committee and pay attention to the matter. Furthermore, indicating the review certificate number on the books could reduce delays for the publishing industry. Finally, several representatives of the publishing industry expressed that the publishing industry felt very convenient about the central government's establishment of the committee and the speed of its review of manuscripts. Finally, the chairman announced that the committee's address has now been moved to Yishiyuan Garden, at the end of Shangwen Road, South City, also known as Ninghe Road. The telephone numbers borrowed from the Chinese district are 22401 and 22402.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Revised Review Methods <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>

<h3 id="e189">Key Points for Improvement in Vocational Education in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Report by an Inspector of the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently dispatched Inspector Zhong Daozan to inspect the state of vocational education in Jiangsu Province. The inspection report has been submitted to the Ministry of Education. The key points regarding the urgent need to improve vocational education in Jiangsu Province are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e190">A. General Matters <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>1.  Apart from the Provincial Zha She Guan Sericulture Vocational School, there are no other independent institutions for girls' vocational education in the province. One or two more should be added to expand opportunities for girls' vocational education.</p>
<p>2.  Provincial schools are mostly of a higher level. Before primary vocational schools can be established everywhere at the local level, they should consider running primary vocational schools concurrently, as appropriate, to meet the needs.</p>
<p>3.  Home economics education is rarely promoted in various provinces and cities. The province, as a developed area of education, should vigorously promote it and establish schools to implement it.</p>
<p>4.  Many private commercial vocational schools are not true to their name. They have neither commercial practice facilities nor sufficient and appropriate commercial cultivation, and are no different from ordinary middle schools. They should be banned and ordered to be converted into commercial vocational supplementary classes when possible, and to accept young shop assistants and apprentices to facilitate practical application.</p>
<p>5.  Middle schools and vocational schools should be set up separately. Do not allow various vocational subjects to continue to be affiliated to middle schools, in order to comply with the regulations.</p>
<p>6.  Efforts should be made to promote and reward the development of private vocational schools with good results. However, the establishment of commercial vocational schools should be based on environmental needs and subject to appropriate restrictions.</p>
<p>7.  The talents and equipment of existing vocational schools should be used to the fullest extent possible to attach various vocational supplementary schools or classes as needed.</p>
<p>8.  It has been found that the physical education regulations for vocational schools stipulate 20 minutes per day, which should be carried out within the practical work time to balance students' physical and mental health. All schools have failed to comply, and attention should be paid to this.</p>
<p>9.  The names of the original vocational schools should be corrected immediately in accordance with the regulations, in order to standardize them.</p>
<h3 id="e191">B. Matters Concerning Various Schools <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>1.  The facilities of the Provincial Yixing Agricultural School have been inadequate in the past, and the training and practical work of students are particularly lax. Agricultural and forestry tools and reference books are also very lacking. Improvements and enrichment are urgently needed.</p>
<p>2.  The Provincial Yixing Pottery School has 20 students and an annual fee of 20,000 yuan, which is uneconomical. The school plans to add a senior high school class to manufacture ceramic tiles, but according to past experience, enrollment is not easy, and it is even more difficult to enroll junior high school students. It can be changed to enroll senior elementary school students for a five-year graduation. At the same time, supplementary classes can be added to enroll factory apprentices. The pricing of the school's products is too high, making it difficult to sell. The pottery carving and other subjects only have one or two hours per week, which should be appropriately increased. Methods and techniques such as color mixing and flower matching, and identification of flame colors should be added, and students should be proficient and clear. They should also actively conduct research with local businesses to improve the pottery industry.</p>
<p>3.  The Provincial Suqian Glass Vocational School has been operating for a short time and has achieved good results. However, most of its products are cups, plates, oil lamps, and lampshades, which compete with existing products on the market. It should also manufacture all the glass equipment needed for physics, chemistry, and biology to resist a portion of foreign goods. The classes should not be limited to senior levels. For products, attention should be paid to the research of heat resistance.</p>
<p>4.  The Provincial Huaiyin Agricultural School has more than 40 faculty and staff, including 17 full-time teachers, 9 part-time teachers, 17 staff members, and 20 school workers. It is said that it is difficult to reduce the number due to the environment and scattered school buildings. Judging from the number of classes and students, there are too many. Efforts should be made to reduce the number, and the manufacturing of agricultural products needs to be improved.</p>
<p>5.  The Provincial Suzhou Industrial School lacks books, and most of the instruments are outdated. Factory practice in the third grade only accounts for one-quarter of the total time, and even less in the first and second grades. The dyeing and weaving performance is poor. The Department of Education ordered the school to focus on production in the future, but it has not been able to proceed due to lack of capital. More workers should be recruited to assist students in production while implementing vocational supplementary education.</p>
<p>6.  The Chemical Engineering Department of the Provincial Suzhou Middle School and the Civil Engineering Department of the Provincial Yangzhou Middle School, both of which are affiliated with senior vocational departments, have achieved considerable results. However, Suzhou Middle School is adjacent to the Provincial Industrial School, and the Chemical Engineering Department should be merged into the Industrial School for dedicated responsibility. The Civil Engineering Department of Yangzhou Middle School should also be merged into the Civil Engineering Department of the Suzhou Industrial School. If it is deemed necessary, a separate school can be set up for the planned water conservancy department to comply with the regulations for the separate establishment of vocational schools.</p>
<p>7.  The Provincial Wusong Fisheries School was well-equipped, but suffered heavy losses due to the January 28 Incident in Shanghai. Subsequently, the Department of Education allocated 40,000 yuan, of which 30,000 yuan was used to repair school buildings and 10,000 yuan was used to replenish machinery, which is less than one-sixth of the original equipment. Teaching is difficult. The cannery cannot produce due to incomplete equipment and lack of working capital. Efforts should be made to restore the old appearance as soon as possible. Students lack the habit of hard work and should also pay attention to this.</p>
<p>8.  The Provincial Suzhou Agricultural School, in addition to focusing on crop improvement in the horticulture department, should also pay attention to flower and garden design. The agricultural product manufacturing in the agronomy department must add machinery to improve products.</p>
<p>9.  The Private Qiming Xiguang Shuxue Chengzhi An Ding Senior and Junior Commercial Vocational Schools, except for Qiming, which originally planned to run a commercial school, the rest are limited to the establishment of senior and junior high schools. They have no choice but to switch to commerce, but in fact they still implement middle school education. A close examination of their class schedules reveals that commercial subjects account for less than one-seventh of the total. As for practice, there is only a dilapidated school store, one or two typewriters, and very little learning time, which is of no practical value. Efforts should be made to ban them and restrict their establishment.</p>
<p>10. The establishment of the Private Nantong College Affiliated Senior Textile Department and Middle School was motivated by the proposal of the Chinese Textile Mill Federation to train intermediate technicians. The Federation was responsible for an annual operating expense of 30,000 yuan, but has only paid for half a year and has not continued to pay. The economy is very tight, the teaching spirit is also poor, and there is no performance to show. The planned metalworking equipment, such as sand casting, models, carpentry, and forging, are all constrained by the economy and cannot be carried out. Efforts should be made to subsidize it. The middle school attached to the agricultural department has no need in the environment and should be converted into senior agronomy and animal husbandry departments to utilize existing equipment and talents to promote them.</p>
<p>11. The Private Zhenjiang Girls' Junior Vocational School's sericulture department has only 9 to 11 hours of vocational subjects per week, and the home economics normal department has only 4 to 6 hours of vocational subjects per week. General subjects, such as Chinese, English, arithmetic, physics, and chemistry, often have as many as 5 to 9 hours, which is largely inconsistent. The home economics normal department lacks equipment, the practice is very insufficient, and the current facilities are not in line with the original purpose of the department. Attention should be paid to home economics labor subjects. It is best to focus entirely on home economics and gardening education for the first three years. Those who aspire to be elementary school labor teachers should extend their studies by one year to specialize in psychology, teaching methods, and teaching material organization.</p>
<p>12. The Private Zhengze Girls' Vocational School's senior painting department has few people and no results to speak of. Applied art courses should be increased, embroidery courses can add sewing subjects, and the three-year rattan work subject should be deleted. The ordinary normal school should be closed or converted into a home economics labor normal department. Supplementary classes are still developed and should be expanded.</p>
<p>13. The Zhenjiang County Vocational Supplementary School and the Nantong County Girls' Vocational Supplementary School, the former has courses in document editing, stabbing, and electroplating, and the latter has courses in sewing and embroidery. Since the purpose of setting up the courses has not been determined, all equipment and teaching are simple and ordinary, and there are no results to speak of. The students in the document course are young and have a low level, and the facilities are particularly inappropriate. They urgently need to be enriched and improved.</p>
<p>14. The Private Southeast Vocational School has agricultural and commercial departments. The commercial department has no equipment. The agricultural field is only five mu. In the first semester, the number of people was sharply reduced because the school was not registered. Parents requested that more general subjects be set up to facilitate further education. In order to adapt to the environment, the school reduced the vocational subjects. The setting of existing subjects is chaotic, without a certain standard. A few school directors are willing to donate farmland and provide strong assistance if the school has a proper reorganization plan. Efforts should be made to assist in the reorganization.</p>
<p>15. The Private Guanghua Junior Simple Chemical Engineering Vocational School has a small and simple practice place, and the planned learning subjects are too complicated, many but not refined. They urgently need to be enriched and improved. Principal Yang Zhengyu also holds a teaching position at a certain university in Shanghai and is not often at school. School affairs are the responsibility of the director of teaching affairs, which is not appropriate.</p>
<p>16. The Private Zhengyi Junior Vocational School originally had commercial and home economics departments, which were not well-managed. After the summer vacation, the commercial department plans to convert to a salt affairs department, focusing on management and manufacturing. It should be converted to senior level and pay attention to curriculum formulation and teacher selection to achieve practical results. The content of the existing home economics curriculum is too simple and not true to its name. Principal Cao Chu is currently the principal of the Provincial Zhenjiang Normal School and only goes to the school once a week, which is inappropriate.</p>

<p>American Jacobs Suffers Defeat at 1-2</p>
<p>America Wins Men's Doubles Championship</p>
<p>Tournament Concludes with All Titles Decided</p>
<p>(London, 7th, Reuters) Miss Dorothy Langrishe, Britain's top female tennis player, displayed exceptionally beautiful tennis today, defeating the All-American Women's Champion, Miss Helen Jacobs, to win the Hulbert Den Women's Singles Championship. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Langrishe (UK) 6-2, 5-7, 6-3, Jacobs (US)</p>
<p>It has been eight years since a British woman won the Hulbert Den Women's Championship, the last time being in 1926. It has been a full twenty-five years since British players simultaneously won the men's and women's titles, the last time being in 1909. Langrishe's victory was a deserved result. From beginning to end, she displayed great confidence, neutralizing the opponent's powerful chops, and her serves and shots were more powerful than usual.</p>
<p>First Set: Jacobs served first and won the first game, but thereafter Langrishe controlled the situation, easily winning the first set with a score of 6-2.</p>
<p>Second Set: Jacobs increased her speed, taking an early lead at 2-1, 3-2, and then 5-3. However, Langrishe retaliated with extremely heavy sideline shots, tying the score at 5-5. At this point, she showed slight nervousness, and Jacobs seized the opportunity to win two consecutive games, taking the second set at 7-5.</p>
<p>Third Set: In the third set, Langrishe regained her confidence, displaying extremely beautiful ball skills, hitting several half-volleys and smashes, and aggressively attacking Jacobs' backhand, winning again at 6-3 and taking the championship.</p>

<p>The result of the Men's Doubles Final: The American championship team of Lott and Stoefen defeated the French duo of Borotra and Brugnon, who had held the championship for two years. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Lott and Stoefen (US) 6-2, 6-3, 6-4, Borotra and Brugnon (France). This French team lacked any of its former prowess. The Americans' powerful serves were often deadly, and their pressure was twice as strong as that of the French. (Havas) The American Lott and Stoefen's three consecutive victories over France are attributed to their ability to exploit the opponent's momentum. The French technique was very skillful, but their failure to capitalize on the opponent's momentum led to their defeat.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Women's Doubles Final <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The result of the Women's Doubles Final: Miss Ryan (US) and Mrs. Mathieu (France) defeated Mrs. Andrews (US) and Mrs. Henrotin (France). The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Miss Ryan (US) 6-3, Mrs. Andrews (US)</p>
<p>Mrs. Mathieu (France) 6-3, Mrs. Henrotin (France). This was Miss Ryan's twenty-sixth appearance in a Hulbert Den final and her thirteenth victory. Although the level of play today was not up to standard, Ryan was undoubtedly the best of the four. The pairing of an American and a French woman on each side was noteworthy. The King and Queen of England attended this match.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Mixed Doubles Final <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The result of the Mixed Doubles Final: The Japanese Miki and British Miss Langrishe defeated the British Austin and Miss Sheppard to win the championship.</p>
<p>Miki (Japan) 3-6 Austin (UK)</p>
<p>Langrishe (UK) 6-4, 6-0 Sheppard (UK). Following her victory over the American Jacobs, Langrishe continued to display excellent tennis in the mixed doubles, combining volleys and smashes with Miki's pressure, leaving the opponents helpless. Miss Sheppard was the weakest of the four, and the opponents focused their attacks on her. Although Austin occasionally intervened, it had little effect.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club's combined doubles championship concluded yesterday. The Kollasch siblings defeated Kerrick and Mrs. Taylor by two sets to one. In the men's doubles exhibition, Devoe was absent at the last minute and replaced by Yu Tianguang. Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia defeated Yu Tianguang and Bonnie Verick by two sets to zero. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e212">Mixed Doubles Final <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The style of play between the Kollasch siblings and Kerrick and Mrs. Taylor was completely different. The Kollasch siblings' victory was entirely due to their youth and strength, fighting tirelessly and playing more steadily. Kerrick's team had Mrs. Taylor constantly positioned at the baseline, tossing the ball high, never advancing. Due to her age, she was unable to run. Kerrick alone jumped around at the net, making more and more mistakes, eventually failing to maintain and losing. The server won in the first set until 8-8, when Kollasch's serve failed, and Kerrick's team won with a score of 10-8. The second and third sets were completely one-sided. In the second set, it was 4-2 and then 6-2. In the third set, it was 5-2, 5-3, and then 6-3. The Kollasch siblings won the championship. After the match, the club president, Graham Hsu, presented the awards. Kerrick was lying on the ground unable to get up. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Miss Kollasch 8-10 Kerrick 6-2</p>
<p>Miss Kollasch 6-3 Mrs. Taylor</p>
<h3 id="e213">Men's Doubles Exhibition <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Yu Tian replaced Devoe and paired with Bonnie Verick. The four players took the court, and the sound of their rackets was deafening. The two teams were evenly matched and difficult to distinguish. Lin and Zheng cooperated well. Zheng Zhaojia's serving errors were still unavoidable. Yu and Peng, partnering for the first time, had many misunderstandings. Bonnie Verick's mistakes were even more numerous. It is difficult to say who was better based on the four players' doubles techniques. Zheng Zhaojia served first and won in the first set. After 2-2, Yu and Peng took a 4-2 lead. Lin Baohua served to regain the game. Bonnie Verick made too many serving errors, gifting the next game, making it 4-4. Then it was 5-5 and 6-6. Lin and Zheng won with a score of 9-7. The situation was even looser in the second set. Lin and Zheng took a 5-2 lead. Yu and Peng won back a game, but it was still resolved with a score of 6-3. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Lin Baohua 9-7 Yu Tianxian</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia 6-3 Bonnie Verick</p>

<p>The Shanghai Bai Hong Track and Field Team is initiating a memorial service for Mr. Sun Duoqi, the team's secretary-general. The origin of the service is as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Duoqi, courtesy name Shuoren, was from Shouzhou, Anhui. He was honest, hardworking, and particularly fond of associating with the masses. In his youth, he studied at the Eighth Middle School in Jiangsu Province. Among all the students in the school, whether they knew him or not, there was no one who did not know his name. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, he was admitted to the Shanghai Postal Administration, where he currently serves as a postal worker in the parcel department. In his interactions with people, he retained the demeanor of a scholar. Among all his colleagues in the bureau, whether they knew him or not, there was practically no one who did not know his name. Such was his sociability. In the autumn of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Bai Hong Track and Field Team was formally established. In its early stages, the scale was relatively small, and he was elected as secretary. In the twentieth year, the team's charter was revised, and the position of secretary-general was added. He was elected to that position. Subsequently, there was an election every year, and everyone considered him an indispensable talent for the team. In particular, the position of secretary-general, as the backbone of the staff committee, was responsible for practical matters. He was re-elected for five consecutive terms, enduring immense hardship. Zhuge Liang was diligent in serving the royal cause, with the saying "exerting every effort until death." Mr. Sun's dedication to Bai Hong was a fulfillment of these words. How sorrowful. We, his colleagues, recall the difficulty of organizing the team, clearing thorns and weeds together from the beginning, and realizing that there were few who shared our success. We feel even more keenly the enormity of his responsibility and the greatness of his contribution. Therefore, we initiate this memorial service for Mr. Sun, simply to do what we can to ease our hearts. We, his colleagues, have worked with Mr. Sun for several years, and some of us may not be fully aware of his admirable words and deeds. Here, we will briefly describe his dedication to the team from the team's perspective, a brief history of his efforts for the team. The matters may involve trivial details, and omissions may be inevitable. However, from our perspective, revisiting the past and using it as a basis for remembrance is also to supplement any omissions in Mr. Sun's conduct. All team affairs were planned by the secretary-general, and Mr. Sun ran errands and did not avoid hardship. For example, when someone went to Beijing for a competition, the name of one athlete, Mr. So-and-so, was accidentally omitted during newspaper coverage. Mr. So-and-so thought it was intentional and sternly rebuked Mr. Sun with an angry tone. Mr. Sun still humbly apologized and tolerated the situation. Such was his ability to endure hardship and accept blame. The team's finances were very strained. Whenever there was a shortage, he would run around to raise funds. Many donors were touched by his sincerity and the rare dedication to promoting sports, so they were happy to contribute. The funds raised by Mr. Sun were substantial. Other expenses, such as those for team social events, negotiating international sporting events, hosting news reporters, hosting team members from other locations, and negotiating all kinds of expenses, were all paid by him. Also, at the beginning of the editing of the team's third annual journal, Mr. So-and-so initially agreed to help with all the printing costs, but after publication, Mr. So-and-so went back on his word. The team was therefore in debt. After several attempts to find a solution, there was still a balance owing. The team could not cover it. At that time, Mr. Sun had important matters at home and borrowed money from the bank at high interest under extremely difficult circumstances, and generously allocated the borrowed money to pay off the debt. His dedication to public service, his selflessness, and his putting public interest before private concerns were beyond the reach of ordinary people. Mr. Sun deeply felt that the maintenance of the team was not easy, so he preferred to endure hardship himself rather than burden the team. Thus, Mr. Sun was no less than a caretaker for the team. However, Mr. Sun was obese and suffered from heart disease, so he was not proficient in any field sports. However, he would occasionally participate in long-distance races. Although he was always the last, or perhaps dozens or even hundreds of steps behind the leaders, and many racers would stop halfway, he would always continue to move forward, completing the course before stopping. His perseverance was truly admirable. Although Mr. Sun himself was not an athlete, he deserves to be praised as a sports administration manager. At every Shanghai National Games, he was hired as the manager of the Chinese team. When the Fifth National Games were held in Nanjing in the twenty-second year, he was also selected as the manager of the Shanghai team. Therefore, in today's Chinese sports world, whether they knew him or not, there was almost no one who did not know his name. Alas, with his prime of life and dedication to serving the sports community, if he had continued to work hard and move forward, the future development of the sports community would have benefited immeasurably from Mr. Sun. But Heaven did not pity him and abruptly took his life. Mr. Sun's death is not only a major loss for the team but also a misfortune for Chinese sports figures. Mr. Sun's family is a prominent family in Anhui, and his brothers have made a name for themselves in the education field. They all maintain integrity and self-discipline. Mr. Sun's income from his postal work was sufficient for his livelihood, but he was fond of making friends and helping others in need, and he was thus in debt. He left behind a wife, a son, and a daughter in dire straits. If we could be granted financial assistance to support the orphans and widows, or bestow an epitaph to honor his grave, the benefit to Mr. Sun would be immense. Therefore, we attach this appeal. This is the announcement. Respectfully announced by all members of the Shanghai Bai Hong Track and Field Team.</p>

<h3 id="e219">The Fragrant Shadow Record of the Imperial Incense <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Because Consort Jin was merely a (concubine) style of consort, and although Empress Longyu was an empress, she was not favored by the Empress Dowager. The details of this are truly complex and difficult to understand: logically, the Empress Dowager should have disliked Consort Zhen because Guangxu was too fond of Consort Zhen, so she should have been happy with Longyu, especially since Longyu was her own niece. However, she did not love Longyu! Large families are the most prone to quarrels, and in the palace, it was especially impossible for everyone to be harmonious. It's a strange thing!</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager was so indifferent and ruthless towards Guangxu, so why did she insist on taking him with her to Fengtian this time? We people knew almost all the reasons for this; even Guangxu himself understood. In a nutshell, it was that the Empress Dowager still did not trust him, fearing that after he was out of her sight, he would have some ill-intentioned plans. Therefore, no matter where the Empress Dowager went, she was always very worried and had to take this special political prisoner with her. Perhaps she also believed that Guangxu no longer had any ambition at this moment, but she was still worried that some of the courtiers might be like the Six Gentlemen, taking advantage of her departure from the capital to incite Guangxu and persuade him to use external force to take back the Empress Dowager's power. This concern was certainly quite possible; and the Empress Dowager's temperament was particularly fond of wielding power. Although she was already an esteemed Empress Dowager, and all her enjoyments were far above those of others, she was not satisfied. She felt that without real political power in her own hands, all the glory and wealth would be equal to zero. Therefore, she did not hesitate to take a great risk, regardless of the slander from all sides, and desperately clung to her power. I often saw her so restless day and night over a difficult political matter that I could not help but secretly wonder, what was the reason that she could enjoy this tirelessly for so long? (7-8)</p>
<h3 id="e220">Childhood Longings <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>Speaking of which, this seems almost like old news. When I was eight years old, I went to the private school, and every day after returning, I was always happy to have (after-school money). Thinking about it now, this amount is truly small and laughable, only three copper coins! However, accumulating it day by day and stringing it on a rope, after a long time, it could become a hundred coins, which I would give to my mother to keep for me. I seemed to have become a rich man.</p>
<p>The so-called snacks didn't require me to dig into my own pocket. Other small snacks are now somewhat vague. It seems that a zongzi candy cost one coin, right? Square cubes of dried tofu cost three coins for two pieces. Sometimes, I would add two coins to the day's after-school money and buy a flat, round pouch of dried tofu to eat heartily, but this already felt too extravagant!</p>
<p>Speaking of snacks, a bowl of large meat noodles costing twenty-four coins was a rare treat. (Crab Shell Yellow) pastries cost three coins each. Steamed buns were worth thirty coins for ten pieces. Tangyuan also cost three coins each. Thinking about it now, this is also very laughable: Tangyuan were usually served with five pieces per order, but my cousin had a small appetite, so whenever he went to the snack shop, he always carried a basket with an empty bowl to bring back the leftover meat filling or the entire tangyuan.</p>
<p>That year, my mother gave birth in the middle of the night, causing me to not sleep well all night. The next morning, as the east turned white, she took pity on me and told me to go to the shop to eat a bowl of chicken noodles, which cost forty-two coins.</p>
<p>(Writing calligraphy) was a required course in the private school. A sheet of bamboo paper costing three coins could be cut into sixteen pieces. My mother put it in an empty honey cake box, and I took one sheet each day, as if I were treasuring it.</p>
<p>The above is of course just some childhood longings. (I look around, but cannot go where I wish,) and only these longings still tug at my heart from time to time.</p>

<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Here, there is no sound of ship whistles, no noise of market, quiet space, only the sound of water gurgling, and women pounding clothes, singing and responding, playing a very rhythmic glissando.</p>
<p>The water wharf is constructed of layers of brick steps built from the flat, sloping riverbank, women walking among them, going back and forth on the high and low levels, the frank situation is more comfortable and freehand than running up the stairs.</p>
<p>In small inland cities, whether villages or rural towns, there is neither the facility of running water nor the many artesian wells. Therefore, women regard the water wharf as the only good place to fetch water, pound clothes, wash rice, and wash vegetables.</p>
<p>Water buckets, clothing clubs, and baskets, blue children, are held in everyone's hands, with every evening, noon, the busiest, when a group of women gathered, from the ripple marks on the water level, aroused every giggle and coquettishness, and the Zhang family chief, the Li family's short, a variety of different conversations. Sometimes, because of the splashing of water and the competition for position, a live drama of mutual scolding can also be staged; the expressions on their faces, from the edge of the water village, fully reveal a kind of innocence that does not contain any of the hypocritical ills of the city.</p>
<p>The inland water wharf is indeed a good place for women to open open-air talk clubs; every noon and evening, I stroll there idly, the delicate voices of the women, agitating the strings of flowing water, often arousing a deep, unspeakable nostalgia in my heart.</p>

<p>— Yan Biguang</p>
<p>This is really a very interesting thing. The Wang family couple next door quarreled because of a casual disagreement. The man is a strong and powerful friend, so his wife is often grabbed by the hair and beaten.</p>
<p>However, when women are wronged, old-fashioned women still use the old method of one cry, two hunger strikes, and three hangings. Unlike modern women, who use the new method of one cry, two runs away, and three divorces. After the Wang family woman was wronged last time, she cried and went on a hunger strike, but her husband ignored her, so she proceeded to the third step: she took a rope and began to practice hanging herself in the room. Just as she was hanging high from the beam, somehow, her husband found out. He rushed into the room and slapped her three times. Although she received three slaps, she was very willing, because custom told her that you must give slaps to the person who hangs to death to drive away the god of death. Who knew that after her husband untied her, he tightened the neck rope, asking her if she wanted to die again? She originally wanted to scare her husband, but how could she know that her husband really wanted her to die, so she had to shake her head repeatedly, and the husband let her go. This time, also because of a quarrel, she wanted to hang herself but it didn’t work, so she changed to drowning herself! When she ran to the river, before she could jump into the water, she was caught by him again. He asked her, “Do you want to drown?” and grabbed her, dipping her into the water several times, and her stomach was filled with water. Her husband was not afraid of death, and from then on she never thought of dying again.</p>

<p>— Tianzai</p>
<p>Society is always a draft to be revised, and there will never be a time when it is satisfactory.</p>
<p>Chinese people love the beauty of neatness and want to collect (ten major crimes) when attacking people.</p>
<p>When flowers fall, pessimists feel sad for them, and optimists think that the time to bear fruit is not far away.</p>
<p>Those who can truly sacrifice should be like soap, dedicated to washing others, while disappearing themselves in the process.</p>
<p>The perfume in the city cannot cover the invisible stench.</p>
<p>Although the lights in the city are bright, they cannot illuminate the entire darkness of society.</p>

<p>Chapter Thirty-One: Three Battles, White Clothes Charge Snow Formations, Whole Battalion Sacrifices, Red Eyes Enter Gun Forests</p>
<p>The brothers rummaged through their pockets, and sure enough, there was a paper roll, which they handed to Ziqiang. When he looked at it, several large characters caught his eye first, which read, "Father's Safe Greeting." These words were truly no less than the enemy's bayonet, stabbing him in the heart, and Ziqiang fainted again. In a daze, he heard a roll call, which was precisely for the brothers of his company. Then he heard Baofang say: "Brothers, we believe in ourselves and are not stupid, having won two battles and made our country proud. I have always said that the brothers led by me, Baofang, are all good friends, and now it's proven. What are we afraid of? There are still more than three hundred of us, and we can still fight the devils for a while. We are good stock, guarding this village, not leaving, waiting for reinforcements to come and hand over the village to them, and then we will advance! Brothers..." Baofang had not finished this speech when there was a deafening bang, and a cannonball came, not knowing where it landed, shaking the entire ground inside the fort. Ziqiang was lying on the pit, but his mind was very clear. He was thinking that the enemy's reinforcements must have arrived, and they wanted to take advantage of the Chinese army's rest and use fresh troops to attack the city again. This was a very vicious method. Just as he was thinking this, he heard a sound of footsteps outside the house, and also heard a very calm voice assigning tasks, clearly that the brothers had just begun to prepare for battle again. After six or seven minutes, he heard a second crash, and another cannonball landed in the fort. At this time, Ziqiang could not bear it any longer. He propped himself up and climbed to the window made of clay bricks to look outside. Sure enough, he saw the brothers carrying ammunition boxes and running up the fortress wall one after another. At the same time, the artillery fire was continuously being fired into the fort. On this side, apart from machine guns, there were no heavier weapons. So even though they were constantly threatened by the enemy's artillery fire, they could only endure it and wait quietly for the enemy to arrive, and then tear them apart. (429)</p>

<h3 id="e225">Catching Tooth Worms <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>An old woman was suffering from a toothache, not closing her eyes all night. The next morning, she waited at the entrance of the alley for a woman who catches tooth worms. She felt as if she had found a living deity, overjoyed and jumping for joy. She quickly invited her into the kitchen. After some haggling, both parties agreed that each tooth worm caught would cost one copper coin. It was said that the woman took pity on the old woman eating home meals, so the fee was particularly low.</p>
<p>Having agreed on the price per worm, the tooth worm catcher took out a yellow paper talisman from her cloth bag under her arm and burned it. She ordered the old woman to swallow it with clear water. Then, from her cloth bag, she took out a wooden hairpin, thick at the end and thin at the tip. She stirred the tip of the hairpin in a packet of gray powder for a while and began to perform her magic in the old woman's mouth. First, she pricked the old woman's gums, covering her teeth with bloodstains. Then, from the bleeding area, she caught tooth worms and placed them in a water bowl.</p>
<p>The more worms she caught, the more there were. Before long, she had caught over fifty worms, floating in the water bowl. Although each worm was only about half the size of a sesame seed, looking at them was enough to make one's hair stand on end. Over fifty worms, at one copper coin each, already required more than five hundred large coins, yet the woman kept catching them. The old woman, feeling the pain in her wallet and becoming suspicious, told her to stop catching them and gave the worm catcher a two-cent silver coin. Afterwards, she took a closer look at the tooth worms in the bowl and found that they were actually seeds that had burst open. She hurriedly went to chase the tooth worm catcher, but she had vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>Following this, another full night was spent without closing her eyes.</p>

<p>One evening, I was dragged by a friend to a certain amusement park.</p>
<p>After sitting down in a certain area, a female teahouse worker brought over two cups of chrysanthemum tea. Then, she brought over two face towels.</p>
<p>My friend, accustomed to this sort of thing, reached out and pulled the female teahouse worker onto the empty chair next to him. The female teahouse worker had an expression of feigned resistance. My friend began to ask her name and where she was from. After some time of fooling around, the female teahouse worker's facial expression changed drastically, becoming talkative and smiling.</p>
<p>When leaving, my friend threw her a dollar and whispered, "Open a room." The female teahouse worker smiled back and whispered, "I can't leave until one o'clock." My friend continued, "I'll wait for you at the XX Hotel. Just ask for Mr. XX in room number X when you arrive."</p>
<p>Leaving the amusement park gate, I bid farewell and went home. A week later, I met my friend again and asked him about that night.</p>
<p>"That female teahouse worker was very cheap, but not very clean. I caught a venereal disease," my friend said with a mournful face. A few days later, I went to find my friend for something, but it was said that he had been hospitalized due to the illness.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Character Diviner <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Character diviners in Shanghai can truly be considered a profession outside of the three hundred and sixty trades. The nature of character diviners is originally that of itinerant performers, possessing a wandering nature, but the character diviners in Shanghai all have fixed locations. Those who set up shop on a certain road, at a certain corner, or at the entrance of a certain alley always set up shop on that certain road, at that certain corner, or at the entrance of that certain alley.</p>
<p>The character diviners in Shanghai also inevitably display signs for "King Wen's Divine Oracle" and "Fortune and Fate," but discussing luck and misfortune is not the main business of Shanghai character diviners. Their real income comes from writing letters for people. For example, small merchants and workers who can't write themselves need to consult character diviners to write letters to their "dear parents" or "virtuous wife" at home. Old women working as maids in Shanghai who need to write letters to their "husband" farming in the countryside are also naturally the character diviner's regular customers. Business cards cost two hundred cash, letters cost at least ten cents, stationery and envelopes are extra, and postage is self-provided. Character diviners are not responsible for unclear addresses or incorrect names, whether the letter is delivered or not.</p>
<p>In addition, writing betrothal cards, loan receipts, separation agreements for lovers, and red paper strips with "Heaven, Earth, Emperor, Emperor" are all good business. Relying on "fortune and fate" can only lead to starvation.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Continued Discussion of Typhoid Fever, Part 2 (Middle) <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Wei also said: "The Foot Yangming Stomach receives the surface evil of the Foot Taiyang. The disease transforms into heat and enters the interior. Because the defensive qi and nutritive qi at the exterior originally originate from the stomach, the heat evil can enter the stomach through the collaterals of the stomach via the defensive qi and nutritive qi. If the disease is in the stomach, it should be treated. If the Hand Yangming Large Intestine is affected by the evil, it does not necessarily need to be treated." This takes the transmission from Taiyang to Yangming as originating from the defensive qi and nutritive qi entering the stomach's collaterals. Ke Yunbo, on the other hand, said that the heart governs nutritive qi, and the lungs govern defensive qi. Wind and cold invading the defensive qi and nutritive qi immediately affects the hand meridians. Alas, the defensive qi and nutritive qi are a single entity. Wei uses them to explain the transmission of typhoid fever to the Foot Yangming Stomach. Ke uses them to refute that injury to the foot does not injure the hand. It can be seen that unfounded words can be quoted in any aspect. Their insignificance is evident. In short, without recognizing what the defensive qi and nutritive qi actually are, without thoroughly investigating their boundaries, arbitrarily choosing what benefits one's own argument, quoting and using it, one can indulge in rhetoric and overturn heaven and earth. It is not merely a matter of far-fetched medical theories. As for saying that evil entering the large intestine does not necessarily need to be treated, this is truly a reckless statement.</p>
<p>Wei also said: "The Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder is originally the life force of the azure sky. All the qi of the body, whether evil or righteous, ascends through the Shaoyang. Therefore, evil in the intestines and stomach that wants to ascend must transmit to the gallbladder. If the disease is in the gallbladder, the Hand Shaoyang Sanjiao... Because it is formless, it borrows the form of the body's shell as its form, so it cannot specifically receive transmitted disease evil." This saying is even more vague and does not need to be discussed.</p>
<p>Wei also said: "If the evil of Shaoyang does not ascend and dissipate but transmits to the interior, it is like wood catching fire. Its smoke must be thrown into moisture... If the Hand Taiyin Lung is affected by evil, it does not necessarily need to be specifically treated." This purely establishes a theory based on the five elements. The theory of the five elements is already deemed incorrect by today's old medical community, so there is no need for me to harp on it.</p>
<p>Wei also said: "The Foot Shaoyin is below, using water to support earth. Its evil is most easily entered. If evil enters the Foot Shaoyin, then the Foot Shaoyin is treated. As for the Hand Shaoyin Heart Meridian, unless evil directly attacks the heart, no matter what the disease, it does not receive evil. All are replaced by the Hand Pericardium and do not need to be treated." The saying of water supporting earth is also based on the five elements and does not need to be discussed. As for saying that the heart does not receive evil, today's typhoid fever often results in death due to heart weakness. Evil's ability to directly attack the heart is definitely substantiated. The saying of the monarch not being attacked is merely an imagination under a monarchical system.</p>
<p>Wei also said: "If the Foot Shaoyin receives evil, whether cold or heat, it all transmits to the Foot Jueyin Liver. There is fire in water, and its qi, whether evil or righteous, must ascend along wood. If the disease is in the liver, the treatment must be in the liver. As for the Hand Jueyin Pericardium, it only replaces the heart in receiving disease and does not receive evil from other meridians." The saying of fire in kidney water comes from Daoism. Fire must ascend along wood. It is a forced interpretation of the Book of Changes and all belongs to empty speculation. Taking the kidney as water and the liver as wood is merely the saying of a school of Han Confucianism and is even more absurd. The saying of the pericardium replacing the heart in receiving disease is as unfounded as the saying of the heart not receiving evil. None of Wei's arguments are correct.</p>
<p>In short, Fang establishes a theory based on yin and yang, and Wei uses the five elements as a theory. Neither is sufficient to prove that the transmission of typhoid fever through the meridians is a truth, and even less sufficient to prove that speaking only of the foot meridians and not of the hand meridians is a fact.</p>
<p>After Fang and Wei, the one who wants to find a new life in the six meridians is Ke Yunbo of Cixi. Ke's approach is: "Zhongjing divides the exterior, interior, yin, and yang of all diseases into six meridians, clarifying the differences and similarities of pulse and syndrome, and the deficiency and excess of cold and heat, so that the treatment of disease is only within the six meridians. If the diseases of the body are all governed by the six meridians, it is like the six officials of the Zhou Rites managing all functions. As for typhoid fever, it is merely one syndrome within the six meridians. Shuhe did not understand that Zhongjing's six meridians are meridians of strategy, not meridians of channels. He rashly used the Treatise on Febrile Diseases of the Inner Canon as a preface and confused the syndromes and treatments of the six meridians. The six meridians of febrile diseases specifically focus on the meridians as the site of disease... Zhongjing's six meridians divide the area of ground. What they encompass is broad, including wind, cold, dampness, heat, internal injury, external affection, from exterior to interior, cold, heat, deficiency, and excess. Therefore, the outlines of the six meridians each establish a system, not restricted by the meridians of channels and not defined by wind and cold." This intends to find a place to stand for the six meridians outside the meridians of channels. It does not follow Fang's theory of the layers of yin and yang, nor does it adopt Wei's theory of the nature and principles of the five elements. Instead, it uniquely takes the evidence of the disease's syndrome as the explanation. However, what it calls the area of ground still cannot escape the old nest of the meridians of channels. Therefore, the ancients were undecided like playing chess. Examining its theory of the area of ground in detail, one can know that what it holds lacks a strong and unyielding special quality.</p>
<h3 id="e229">A Discussion on the Placenta and Umbilical Cord (Part 1) <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Shaoheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times on June 25, 1934, published:</p>
<p>An Old Man Fantasizes about Rejuvenation by Eating Placenta. Grandson is Often Sick, Daughter-in-Law Complains, Accusing Son of Disrespect. The author is quite interested in this news item and believes that it is necessary to conduct detailed research on society, medicine, and law. I will now list my personal views on the left. I hope that comrades will correct them.</p>
<p>(1) Old Theories About the Placenta</p>
<p>The placenta, commonly known as the fetal membrane, is called "human placenta" or "Purple River Cart" in ancient medical books. It is also called "Chaotic Garment." It treats weakness and fatigue of qi and blood, and damage from labor in women. It also treats all kinds of postpartum damage. There are ancient formulas such as River Cart Pills and Great Creation Pills. It is just that the production is extremely difficult, so few people use it.</p>
<p>(2) The Composition of the Placenta and Its Effects on the Fetus</p>
<p>The placenta is a flat, oval, spongy disc-like object formed by the decidua basalis and the chorionic membrane. It is rich in blood vessels and has a bluish-red color. It first appears in the second month of pregnancy and is completed in the fourth month of pregnancy. The placenta at the end of pregnancy has a diameter of 15 to 20 centimeters. However, its thickness, edges, and fetus are like the ashes after smoking.</p>
<p>(4) Biological Research on the Placenta</p>
<p>Since Luthude and Larrierll discovered a specific PlassroidaleKugel in Syncytium cells in 1901, it has been considered a product of endocrine secretion, and the theory that the placenta has an endocrine effect has been advocated.</p>
<p>In 1904, Halbor stated that changes in the genitals during pregnancy, hair growth, the mammary glands of newborns, the uterus, mammary glands, and menstruation were all the result of stimulation by placental products. Buchaeart also advocated that the placenta has the effect of promoting milk secretion. Based on his own experimental results, those who supported his opinion included Lederer, Prjibsani, Mayer, and the Japanese scholar Dohi. Clypon initially refuted it but later agreed. However, according to the results of experiments by Ott, Scott, Ascherer, Crigorin, Herimann, and the Japanese scholar Taniguchi using the corpus luteum of the ovary; Hochstatter using the pituitary gland; Ott, Scott using the pineal gland and thyroid gland; and Schaefer, Mackensjie using the postpartum uterus, all obtained the same galactagogue effect as the placenta. Therefore, it is believed that the galactagogue effect of the placenta is not unique to the placenta but is a common component contained in the organs. The Japanese scholar Hirose's research on the placental emulsion, which has a proven effect of promoting mammary gland development, is quite detailed.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Yellow Plum Season and Lung Disease <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Shen De</p>
<p>It is generally known that winter is not suitable for the treatment of lung disease. In cold weather, the climate is dry, and the airways are prone to inflammation, causing colds and coughs, which have a negative impact on lung disease. However, there is less rain in winter, and there are more opportunities to perform outdoor air therapy. When the weather is cold, patients and caregivers are extra cautious. Therefore, as a result, fewer lung disease patients experience aggravation in winter. This is not the case in summer, especially during the yellow plum season, which is even more unfavorable for lung disease. Symptoms that are gradually recovering, such as fever and hemoptysis, often recur during this period. When the temperature is hot and the humidity is high, even healthy people feel uncomfortable, so the impact on patients is naturally even greater.</p>
<p>From my own experience, I often feel tired for no reason in the summer. Sometimes, I feel unwell all over and don't know where to place myself. Many critically ill lung disease patients in the hospital also die in the summer. Therefore, I believe that the yellow plum season and summer are the times when lung disease patients should pay the most attention to treatment.</p>
<p>The principles of treating lung disease are nothing more than rest, fresh air, and adequate food. Among these, rest is the most important. Overwork is most harmful to lung disease. Therefore, those with lung disease should be careful everywhere and not allow their bodies to feel tired. It is too late to rest after feeling tired.</p>
<p>In the city, except for those who live in the suburbs, it is difficult to obtain fresh air. Shanghai, in particular, has a dense population and poor air quality, which is worse than other places. Therefore, the wealthy</p>

<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Medicine is a tool for preserving life, but if used improperly, it is more than enough to kill. Therefore, for non-doctors to practice medicine and for non-doctors to use medicine are both extremely dangerous. Ordinary newspapers in European and American countries never publish any medical advertisements because the nature of advertisements is often exaggerated and untrue, and the general public lacks the ability to judge medicine. Once allowed to publish them extensively, both quack doctors and quack medicines can use a small space in the newspaper to sell their monopolistic sales tactics, and the public with simple knowledge will be shocked by their rhetoric, rush to them like ducks, buy them without hesitation, and fall into their trap without realizing it. To prevent their malpractices and eliminate their dangers, to save the public from confusion, to cut off the path of quack propaganda, and to prevent the tools of life from turning into instruments of death, this is what enlightened journalists in our country should deeply consider and carefully plan.</p>
<p>(Editor's note) This journal has always been extremely strict with medical advertisements, and the advertisements in this supplement are even stricter. Because medicine concerns life, it is necessary to pay serious attention to it.</p>

<p>can move to the mountains in summer. Those who are poor should at least open more windows and not live in enclosed rooms.</p>
<p>In summer, special attention should be paid to the cooking methods of food to make patients improve their appetite. Sometimes, the elemental diet therapy can be used as a supplement.</p>
<p>In the early stages of lung disease, it is necessary to examine the lungs with X-rays. If it is possible to perform artificial pneumothorax, then this therapy should be performed by a skilled physician. It can promote the healing of the disease and shorten the treatment time. Even from an economic point of view, it is the cheapest method. Its effect is a hundred times better than drug treatment. However, the timing of this procedure must be based on the doctor's instructions. Do not make your own decisions and stop it halfway.</p>
<p>Because once this procedure is stopped, it is difficult to reapply it. When I was a student, I contracted a lung disease and underwent this treatment for three years. I studied with the illness, and now I am engaged in busy medical work and do not feel any suffering. All of this is thanks to artificial pneumothorax.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(Manuscript of a speech given at the Public Education Hall on July 8)</p>
<p>Today, I am honored to be invited by the director of the Shanghai Public Education Hall to speak at your hall about children's hygiene. I, as a humble person, have been very busy with my practice in the past few days and have not had any free time to devote to society, which I am very ashamed of. However, it was difficult to refuse the kind invitation, so I have made some time today to ramble on a bit.</p>
<p>Today, I will be talking about the hygiene of academic instruction and physical examinations of children. This is a very important issue regarding children's bodies and their future happiness as adults. At the same time, it is also something that our great educators keep in mind at all times and want to do practically. We must know that being able to appropriately apply hygienic methods during education has a great positive impact on the physical and mental development of children in school, which goes without saying. Therefore, school hygiene books often discuss in detail the hygienic methods to be used when teaching various subjects.</p>
<p>First, the Hygiene of Academic Instruction</p>
<p>The most important thing to pay attention to during teaching is whether the children's posture is correct. The first element of posture is that the chest develops equally on both the left and right sides. The chest of a newborn is absolutely different from that of an adult. The spine of a newborn is a straight line without curvature, and the ribs are perpendicular to the spine. The chest wall formed by the ribs is cylindrical, much like a wooden barrel used to hold cement. When the child is able to walk, the chest initially bears the weight of the head, and then the weight of the internal organs and its own weight, so the front wall is pulled downward. The ribs tend to slant forward and downward to the spine. At that time, the spine curves to a certain extent due to the center of gravity. For these reasons, the chest gradually becomes flat, and the cross-section of the adult chest becomes oval, and the spine protrudes forward. This kind of chest is the foundation of our entire trunk and the main part of posture.</p>
<p>The body's posture should be symmetrical from front to back and left to right, and the development of the limbs should also be appropriate. However, upon close study, our human bodies are not symmetrical from left to right. The outer corners of the eyes are not on the same horizontal line; the shapes of the left and right nostrils are also different; the thickness of the left and right limbs are also different. Even the chest is different on the left and right sides. After carefully measuring the height of the two shoulders, there are also some differences. The reason for this asymmetry is due to the position of the internal organs and the amount of habitual exercise and labor in daily life. If the degree is deep, then the position and function of the internal organs will be greatly affected. This will become a bad posture. Many children develop spinal curvature (such as hunchback) and chest deformities because their parents do not provide reasonable care and upbringing during their childhood. The most common chest deformities are left-right asymmetry, funnel chest, pigeon chest, barrel chest, atrophic chest, and localized protrusion of the chest. We collectively call these many deformities bad posture. In schools, we must train children to practice hygiene and prevent the formation of bad posture, which is the foundation for cultivating healthy citizens. Especially during subjects such as reading, writing, drawing, arithmetic, and work, children are most prone to adopting a hunchbacked posture. At this time, we should pay full attention to them.</p>
<p>Speaking of reading and writing, these are things that children in our schools do every day. Writing in our country is especially more complicated than in foreign countries. They have to write both Chinese characters and Western letters, and sometimes they have to write phonetic symbols. The writing tools used include brush pens, pencils, slate pencils, and fountain pens. There are also chalks. With such a variety of tasks to do every day, the chances of developing abnormal body postures are very high. How can we not pay full attention to it?</p>
<p>Third, Physical Examination</p>
<p>Schools must spend a few days at the beginning of each semester to conduct physical examinations for students. In addition, there are also temporary physical examinations conducted for various purposes. Why do educators willingly sacrifice so much precious time to do this work? That is to say, conducting physical examinations for children every year can provide them with valuable records and statistics on health protection or health promotion. However, now, in many schools, due to time constraints, complete and ideal physical examinations are not being conducted for most students, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>(A) The Value of Physical Examination We can divide education into two goals: mental and physical. Physical education is physical education. And physical examination is also part of the physical education category. The result is, of course, to further pursue appropriate educational methods, such as dividing children into two categories, physically weak and strong, after the physical examination, and implementing appropriate physical education separately. For those with developmental or nutritional deficiencies, we need to study ways to help development and improve nutrition. For those with defects or diseases, we should provide correction and treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e233">A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (11) <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 4: The Evolution of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>What is exudative inflammation? It is characterized by exudate. This cause is entirely due to changes in the blood vessel walls; at that time, the blood vessel lumen dilates, and the components of the blood also exude out of the vessel walls. In this way, the surrounding tissues are infiltrated, and the local area exhibits redness, swelling, and heat. This process is called (exudation); the blood cells and fluid exuded from the blood vessels are what Gang Xian called (exudate). This kind of blood cell is mostly multinucleated white blood cells. This kind of exudative inflammation also differs in terms of the nature and state of the exudate, and pathological changes, with various distinctions such as serous, catarrhal, hemorrhagic, purulent, and putrefactive. The states within these are certainly very specialized, so I will omit them all.</p>
<p>The second type is proliferative inflammation, which is also commonly called productive. It is characterized by the proliferation of connective tissue. The components of this proliferative tissue, in addition to newly formed capillaries, also produce various cells. This state is mostly a phenomenon of healing for each type of inflammation; however, it is also possible for this change to appear at the time of onset. Having clarified the general situation of exudative and proliferative inflammation, we can then proceed further and talk about the changes that occur in the tissues of the human body in tuberculosis (strictly speaking, pulmonary tuberculosis). We must know that once tubercle bacilli invade the human body, they develop and reproduce in it, resulting in the formation of a hard nodule, which is the (tubercle) that everyone knows. It is composed of granulation tissue; it does not contain blood vessels, or at least, it can be said that blood vessels are very scarce; therefore, the nutrition inside is often lacking. As a result, it is easy to become (necrotic).</p>

<p>(4) Discussing an Eye Disease Originating from Gonorrhea</p>
<p>The occurrence of ophthalmia neonatorum in newborns usually happens on the third or fifth day after birth. Its transmission is not directly infected in the birth canal, but indirectly infected after delivery. However, if the puerperal woman does not have gonorrhea, the newborn will not have the chance of infection. Speaking of its danger, although it is less dangerous than adult gonorrheal ophthalmia, it is also easy to cure if treated properly. However, things are not always like this in reality, because by the time they seek medical attention, the dangers mentioned above have already occurred, inevitably leading to the tragic result of blindness. I remember when I visited a school for the blind in Germany, I learned that 30% to over 50% of blind children lost their sight due to ophthalmia neonatorum. Furthermore, according to a survey by a certain medical expert, among the 1,040 people who became blind in the first year of life, as many as 753 people were due to ophthalmia neonatorum. Looking at it this way, ophthalmia neonatorum is as dangerous and frightening as adult gonorrheal ophthalmia, which can also prove the close relationship between gonorrhea and eye diseases. This disease is best treated in hospital with isolation. Never let self-proclaimed doctors with superficial knowledge treat it indiscriminately, otherwise, once the treatment period is missed, blindness will be inevitable. Now I will talk about the prevention methods for this disease in detail. If it can be implemented, it may be a safe approach.</p>
<p>(A) For those who already have gonorrhea: (1) Whether male or female, when suffering from gonorrhea, a formal specialist doctor should be consulted immediately for diagnosis and treatment. Do not delay. (2) Before eating and washing your face, and after urination, wash your hands thoroughly with carbolic soap. Do not directly infect your own eyes. (3) Do not wash your clothes and pants with others.</p>
<p>(B) For those who do not have gonorrhea: (1) Do not get too close to people who already have gonorrhea. (2) Use public towels less often. (3) Prohibit unclean sexual intercourse, which can reduce the chance of indirect infection.</p>
<p>(C) Prevention of ophthalmia neonatorum in newborns: This is something that obstetricians or midwives should do. In European and American countries and Japan, there are already mandatory regulations in the law. I don't know if our country has this law. However, general formal obstetricians and midwives have already implemented this law. The method of this law is based on the method created by Crede in 1882. This method is to wash the whole body and face of the child after delivery, and then instill 2% silver nitrate solution into both eyes. Speaking of the prevention of ophthalmia neonatorum, it can be said to be very effective. Recently, some people have switched to using drugs like 10% to 20% silver proteinate, such as Targesin, Protangel, etc. Their efficacy is also good. However, there are many midwives in our country. I don't know if they use this prevention method. This belongs to the matter of health administration. I am not in a position to criticize anything. I can only hope... (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e235">On the South Manchuria Railway Line <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>When you get on the South Manchuria Railway train, everyone will have a few common feelings: that the train is very clean, the ride is smooth, and there are rarely crowded passengers.</p>
<p>However, you will always have an opposite feeling: that you are not sitting on a train, but a poor little bird living under someone else's roof. The owner of the train is a big eagle, always opening its mouth wide, ready to swallow you into its big belly.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first few feelings result in us admiring the seriousness with which others handle affairs, achieving good results, while the latter feeling makes those of us who enjoy the benefits feel ashamed and uneasy, with a certain sense of unease and lack of freedom.</p>
<p>Going south from Changchun, the road is full of vast plains, which is part of the Guandong Plain geographically. Sipingjie is the largest station between Changchun and Shenyang, and also a collection point for grain, fur, and hides. The Siping-Taonan Railway stretches its long neck to the border of Inner Mongolia, swallowing a bellyful of grain, fur, and hides, and transporting them to Dalian trainload after trainload. At the same time, farmers in northern Liaoning and southwestern Jilin also drive large carts pulled by four or six horses at the end of the year to transport grain to this place for sale. However, before the railway was opened, it is said that Tieling replaced Sipingjie's position.</p>
<p>Further south, the soil is mostly red. The main agricultural product along the line is sorghum, because this is the main staple food of the people of Liaoning. However, since last year, people on the train have not been able to see the green stems and red spikes within twenty li. This is because the Japanese are afraid that the Volunteer Army is hiding in the fields. South of Liaoyang, north of Haicheng, and Anshan Station must be specially mentioned, because there is a very large (exactly how large is impossible to say) (Anshan Iron and Steel Works,) few iron and steel works in Japan can compare with it. Sitting on the train, in the morning or evening, you will see cheap Chinese laborers carrying baskets, going to and from work on both sides, walking like beads, wearing yellow and thin faces. They are all slaves who have left the fields and gone to the iron factory to sell their blood and sweat to Japanese imperialism. They can only do ordinary work. It is said that some secret work is all done by the Japanese themselves. What exactly they are doing is impossible for outsiders to say, but because it is an iron and steel factory, people can still imagine that nine out of ten things are secretly manufacturing lethal weapons.</p>
<p>South of this, there are gradually more mountains, but they are all bald, and their decadent appearance is like a beggar lacking clothes and food in winter. When you get to Wafangdian Station, the situation is different. The mountains gradually increase, and each mountain is covered with green pine clothes. Even on the rocky mountains, there are still green pines everywhere, but the pine branches are slightly shorter, which is due to the later planting time. South of Jinzhou, there are many fruits along the road, especially apples. The scope of sales has already broken through the South Manchuria Railway line and spread throughout the entire Northeast. This item alone, apple income, adds a large amount of income to the Japanese every year. It is very convenient to eat on the South Manchuria train, because there are people who specialize in selling snacks on the train, all of which are Japanese goods, but they are all very clean. Eight out of ten passengers are our compatriots.</p>
<p>Now every station is surrounded by heavy barbed wire fences, which can be said to be a new construction after the September 18th Incident. Also, the piles of sand piled up at the station are all new products to prevent attacks by the Volunteer Army.</p>
<h3 id="e236">The Farmer's Life in the Poet's Mind <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Opening the third issue of the "Fiction Semi-Monthly," I saw Mr. Yu Dafu's handwritten poem about what he saw on the road in Lin'an:</p>
<p>(Four or five houses with mud walls and thatched roofs, two or three camellia buds just sprouting; when the weather is fine, men and women are busy farming, leaving the flowers in front of the door idle.) I can't help but think of Lu Fangweng's poems and Xin Jiaxuan's lyrics. This relaxed rural scenery, like the March breeze, makes everyone have thoughts beyond the dust. But I come from the countryside and know a lot about rural affairs. This poetic rural sketch is all a fantasy of the literati.</p>
<p>It has been very dry for months, and the waterwheels should be very busy. The literati imagine: a crescent moon, a few scattered stars, a cool breeze gently blowing, and a thin dew soaking your clothes. At this time, holding the horizontal bar and stepping on the treadle, the sound of the waterwheel and the singing intertwine, what a poetic thing this is! An ancient poem says: (The gentle breeze sends the sound of the treadle,) how can it not make people yearn for it! However, this twist will turn out to the conclusion that (there is a big mistake)! The body of the waterwheel must be made of extremely fine and hard wood, because the body of the wheel is sometimes immersed in water and sometimes exposed to the sun. If you don't use this kind of wood, it will easily crack. The treadle and the wheel have to carry three or five people, so they also have to be made of fine and hard wood. The whole waterwheel is heavy and heavy. Four poets cannot lift a wheel body, and three pairs of literary giants cannot carry a wheel. Water pumping is often done by streamside ponds, high streamside banks, deep pond water, (two people wheel) is not up to the task; is often a dozen feet tall wheels (four or five people wheel) erected there. When there is a lot of water, four or five people step on the water at the same time, step by step, like carrying a thousand kilograms of load, simply can't be lazy; sweat dripping, panting, the soles of the feet are hot and blistered, but you have to step on it step by step. The water level has gone down, and the body of the wheel is light, but the rice seedlings, which are being fertilized, are more urgent than a baby drinking milk. Looking at the dry streams and ponds makes people even more anxious. The streams and ponds are dry, and the only source of water can only rely on the mountain spring at the bottom of the ground. Dig a deep hole in the ground, and wait for three or five hours for the spring to fill a small pool. This spring water is more valuable than gold. Sometimes the ground is high and the water is small; the coupled wheels can't be hoisted up, and you can only watch the rice fields wither and burn, and you have to sigh! My father, when he was alive, talked about how my ancestor was lonely and poor in his youth. When the weather was dry, he pumped water, and he couldn't do it. My grandmother used both hands to help him. Pointing and showing each other, tears were like rain. Late at night, every time I heard the sound of the wheel, it was like a ghost wailing, so sad that I couldn't bear to listen. Unfortunately, this kind of real feeling has never been written into the poet's pen!</p>
<p>Li Shangyin's poem: (Stop the car and lie down to watch the maple forest at dusk, the frosted leaves are redder than the flowers in February.) Watching the red leaves in the autumn mountains, the high and refreshing sky, set off by the fiery frosted leaves, there is a great interest in this. Red leaves, especially the leaves of the tallow tree, are the most beautiful; its leaves are denser than maple leaves. Once the cold frost falls, the tallow leaves change suddenly, light yellow and deep red, mixed together; covering the mountains and fields, dyed into a large picture; poets also like to write this into the poem. However, the farmers have never taken these red leaves seriously; once the red leaves fall, the tallow seeds are ripe, and the silvery tallow seeds are cracked from the black and shiny ones. Big and small, male and female, everyone goes to the mountains and fields to pick tallow seeds; tallow oil is used to light lamps, tallow shells are used to make fire, and tallow cakes are used to fertilize the fields. The farmers regard this as an income in winter. Speaking of collecting tallow seeds, I am terrified; there is a kind of hairy caterpillar on the tallow tree, even after heavy frost, it is still alive, and almost every tree has it. Once a worm touches the body, it itches and blisters, and the pain is unbearable; burning rice straw to smoke it also takes four or five hours to return to normal; or use vegetable oil and salt to rub it all over, it hurts slightly; at this time, even if there are ten buckets of poetic feelings, it will turn into a hundred liters of anger! The year before last, in the countryside of Zhenru, I saw a red tallow tree, and I couldn't help but feel homesick; I also thought of the hairy caterpillars, and my heart was cold; the bitter hairy caterpillars once a year, this is also something that poets did not expect when chanting red leaves.</p>
<p>Watching lotus and picking lotus in summer is a refined thing. The lotus blossoms emerging from the water are delicate and dripping; the lotus leaves are fragrant; the human world and the heaven, this scene is the same. The new lotus is fresh and tender, and it is sweet and soft when it enters the mouth, and it is even more delicious. (Picking lotus and picking lotus again, the lotus leaves are so lush.) The farmers in the lotus bushes are no less than immortals. Good, then please ask the poet to pick lotus! The lotus stalks are full of fine thorns. Where the feet pass, they cut the thighs like a knife. Once you pick lotus, it is like being slowly sliced to death. There are many leeches in the water, stinging the thighs and sucking blood, often causing itchiness; and you can't pull them out immediately, otherwise the head will break into the skin and invade the blood vessels. These kinds of situations are also far beyond the poet's imagination!</p>
<p>Therefore, after reading Mr. Yu Dafu's impromptu poems, I can't help but think of Mr. Lu Xun's "Storm":</p>
<p>(Old men and men sit on low benches, shaking large plantain fans and chatting idly, children run like flying, or squat under the tallow trees and gamble with stones. Women bring out dark steamed dried vegetables and pine flower yellow rice, steaming with heat. Literary people's wine boats sail in the river; when literary giants see it, they are filled with poetic inspiration and say: (Without worries, this is really a rural paradise.)</p>
<p>But the words of the literary giants are somewhat inconsistent with the facts, just because they have not heard the words of Old Woman Jiujin. ... )</p>

<p>— Cao Huchu</p>
<p>I just can't understand, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand can't understand: are there no other people in our village? Why do you have to let Wang the old man be the village chief!</p>
<p>Grandpa Li next door said that Old Man Wang is a scholar, a Xiucai from the Qing Dynasty. In our village, his qualifications are the oldest, and his reputation is the greatest. Naturally, he is worthy of being the village chief.</p>
<p>Humph! Scholar! What is the use of a scholar? Scholars only know how to eat, not how to farm; only know how to pace, not how to walk long distances; only know how to shake their heads and hum a few rotten tunes, not how to do things honestly. Their bodies are as thin as dried eggplants, and their arms are as thin as dry firewood sticks. Don't say going to fight foreigners, we don't need them. Even if we call them to fight Zhang Ersao at the entrance of the village, they will shout for help. The boss of the small shop at the bridgehead said the day before yesterday; (China is so poor and bullied by foreigners to this point, it is really because there are too many scholars; because most of the scholars in China only know how to eat idly, put on airs, read a few dead books, and are unwilling to do things honestly.) Thinking about this carefully, there is some truth to it.</p>
<p>Humph! Old Man Wang is a scholar, let's see what skills he has? People say that he has read a lot of books, his belly is very open, and he can write good characters. In the southern villages, he is counted as the number one or number two old brand Xiucai. Humph! What's the use of having an open belly if you don't know how to do things? What's the use of writing well, only knowing how to make a splash by stamping a few signatures on everyone's land deeds, not knowing how to hold a hoe and dig the ground? If everyone in our village were like him and did nothing, didn't know how to hold a hoe and dig the ground, even if the Heavenly Lord pitied us and gave us good weather all year round, the fields would be barren and withered, and everyone would be starving ghosts. Humph! Old Man Wang is worthy of being the village chief, really the heavens have no eyes, everyone respects him, pats his ass, but I am not convinced.</p>
<p>Granny Li said: (Scholars know reason, and besides, Mr. Wang is a famous Xiucai in the southern villages. If we don't respect him and let him sit in the chair of village chief, who else is qualified.)</p>
<p>Humph! What does the old woman know! I don't believe the saying that scholars know reason either. Isn't the old gentleman Guo in the county a scholar from a family of books and incense with a great reputation? Why did he plot to seize the property of his widowed sister-in-law in March of the old year, causing his sister-in-law to commit suicide by drowning! The teacher in the Dongcun school is of course a scholar. Why did he also skim off the top when handling the land declaration a few years ago, stuffing the public money into his own pocket, and sitting in jail for three months! In the old year, the second little boss of the landlord where I worked, wasn't he a college graduate? Why didn't he do some business properly, but insisted on being a partner with gangsters, indulging in prostitution and gambling all day long, and as a result, he was driven away by his father, who refused to recognize him as his son? Do you say that Old Man Wang is a scholar who knows reason? Since he is the village chief, how can he only know how to lick the boots of the county officials, bureau chiefs, and big gentry in the city, and not know anything about running the village? He doesn't care if the village has a bad harvest; he doesn't care if people in the village are infected with the plague; he doesn't care even more if robbers come to the village. These are still acceptable, but he hides by the opium lamp every day, scraping his guts for oil, planning how to rip off someone, planning how to skim off a bit of oil; planning how to flatter his superiors; planning how to hang on a woman's arm... Is this kind of low-down behavior considered reasonable?</p>
<p>Ah! Ah! Speaking of women, it really makes my stomach burst with anger! Yesterday I was chatting with Sister Agui under the big tree at Nanhetou, and this old thief saw it. He actually lectured me, saying that I shouldn't be flirting with women, and if I did it again next time, he would definitely send me to the Public Security Bureau. His mother! He doesn't touch his own ass, but instead lectures me! Who doesn't know about his early years, who doesn't know? I am a bachelor, and Sister Agui is an old maid who is almost thirty years old. Everyone chatting about love is not a big deal. Besides, we have never had any sneaky affairs except for talking a few words when we meet; he, who is worse than beasts, is always more decent. Is it possible that because he is a scholar, a Xiucai, a village chief, he can act recklessly, do whatever he wants, and consider low-down behavior to be proper and reasonable? Is it possible that we poor people chatting a few words with the people we love in the sun during the day is considered a crime? His mother! At that time, if I wasn't afraid of scaring Sister Agui, I would definitely give that shameless old thief a few slaps in the face!</p>
<p>In a word: it is really absurd that Old Man Wang, a person like that, is worthy of being the village chief, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand absurd! Others respect him and pat his ass, but I just don't agree; if I run into him, I won't give him a few white eyes unless heaven and earth turn upside down. Anyway, I don't want to rely on his signboard and don't want to eat a grain of his rice.</p>

<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>My companion let out a mocking laugh in the next room, and I quickly broke free from her hand, deliberately shouting in a low voice when running out of the room (Female swindler, what a powerful female home wrecker!)</p>
<p>I don't know why God always calls me to run into those troublesome women.</p>
<p>It was my fifth year as a policeman, and at that time I was a squad leader. The fourth district chief was originally preparing to promote me to police chief. But because of a stupid thing, I had to suffer for two more years. But it's still considered that God has eyes, there are many people who have been policemen for twenty years and are still getting 80% of their wages.</p>
<p>That was a very unusual woman, her mouth as sharp as a sword! It was probably around noon in June of the previous year. I had just started work not long ago. A crowd of people surrounded the entrance of Pingxi Lane in Xiajiufu. I strode in with my police baton as usual. A thin woman with a sallow complexion in her thirties was sitting cross-legged against the wall, holding an infant covered in rags like a dried monkey in her hands, with some bloodstains on the little head. People believed that she had just given birth, so many coppers and coins stood quietly around the woman; I suddenly became very smart and understood in my heart that something must have happened. So I bent down and said to the woman:</p>
<p>(Can you walk?) She nodded reluctantly. So I took her all the way to the (Chengxi Convenient Hospital).</p>
<p>(Do poor people need to go to the hospital?) When she got to the entrance of the hospital, she hesitated and said, I explained to her and dragged her in.</p>

<h3 id="e240">Methods for Compiling Import Tariffs <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Zixiu</p>
<p>Import tariffs have the effect of restricting import trade, hence the term "tariff barriers" used by commentators. In reality, this analogy is not entirely accurate; rather than calling them barriers, it's better to call them sluice gates. This is because the function of tariffs is not only to restrict trade but also to regulate it, just like sluice gates regulate water flow. Building a sluice gate requires considerable skill; it's not just about being tall and large. Compiling tariffs is much the same. Since China achieved tariff autonomy, tax rates have repeatedly increased. When discussing tariffs, most Chinese people focus on the level of tax rates, seemingly paying less attention to the structure of the tariff itself. Therefore, I will briefly describe the methods for compiling tariffs.</p>
<p>The work steps for compiling tariffs can generally be divided into four categories: (Classification), (Categorization), (Formalization), and (Rate Setting).</p>
<p>(1) "Classification" refers to the process of categorizing the myriad of goods into a specific system based on their nature. This ensures that everything is well-organized, without omissions, and with minimal overlap. There are approximately four types of classification methods: by tax rate (high or low), by alphabetical order, by the production system, or by the use of the goods. The first two methods are simpler and can only be used when the number of items is small. The latter two methods are more precise and are commonly used in tariffs. However, each has its advantages and disadvantages. If classification is purely based on the production system, ordinary bulk goods, from raw materials to finished products, can have a fixed and unchangeable sequence, but semi-finished products pose a challenge. If classification is based on usage, there is no difficulty with miscellaneous products, but for goods with multiple uses, it is difficult to decide which category to place them in. Therefore, most tariffs usually consider both aspects and make slight modifications. The methods of modification vary greatly depending on the circumstances of each country. For example, if a certain product is a major import in one country, it may be designated as a separate category to show importance. If another country rarely imports it, this is not necessary. Furthermore, if a product is used as food in country A but only as an industrial raw material in country B, the classification results will naturally differ. The former International Economic Conference made a suggestion to standardize the tariff classifications of various countries. Although the principle was approved, it ultimately failed, for this very reason.</p>
<p>(2) "Categorization" refers to dividing an item into several categories based on its characteristics, aiming to adjust tax rates or facilitate differential treatment. Regarding differential treatment, some items within the same category can be manufactured domestically, while others cannot. Some are mostly imported from country A, and others are mostly imported from country B. To devise appropriate countermeasures, it is essential to distinguish them clearly. Regarding adjusting tax rates, the prices of superior and inferior goods within the same category may vary greatly. Applying the same tax rate would unfairly burden one more than the other. For example, if the value of a certain item varies from one to ten dollars per unit, and the tax rate is set at one dollar, the rate on the superior goods is only 10% of their value, while the rate on inferior goods reaches 100%. In this situation, it is necessary to divide the item into several categories and assign appropriate tax rates to each. The criteria for categorization may be based on size, weight, length, price, or the special characteristics of the item, such as the yarn count of cotton yarn, the thread count of fabric, the optical rotation of sugar, the alcohol content of wine, and so on. It is important to have clear and definite boundaries. Sometimes, an item can be divided in multiple ways. Determining the most suitable method depends on the specific needs. Moreover, for the sake of necessity, there are times when one knowingly chooses not to categorize even though it is possible. For example, if the low-end products within a certain item can be manufactured domestically, while the high-end products cannot yet be manufactured, then, under appropriate circumstances, applying the same tax rate regardless of quality can avoid hindering the trade of high-end products while restricting the import of low-end products, which is not unfeasible. Therefore, categorization is not about quantity; complexity that precisely meets needs is the best choice.</p>
<p>(3) "Formalization" refers to stipulating the form of the tax rate. There are approximately four forms of tax rates: (Ad Valorem), (Specific), (Ad Valorem and Specific), and (Ad Valorem or Specific). "Ad Valorem" is calculated based on the value of the goods, regardless of quantity, such as silk at 100% of its value and coarse grains at 10% of its value. "Specific" is calculated based on the quantity of the goods, regardless of price, such as handkerchiefs at 30 cents per dozen and buttons at 6 cents per gross. Each of these two forms has its advantages and disadvantages, which can generally be distinguished in three ways. First, in terms of equitable burden, ad valorem taxes are clearly more flexible, avoiding the situation of being disproportionately light or heavy. Specific taxes, on the other hand, have the opposite effect. No matter how precise the categorization, there will inevitably be a situation where high-value goods are taxed lightly and low-value goods are taxed heavily within the same category, though the difference will be smaller with more precise categorization. Second, in terms of tax administration, the advantages and disadvantages are reversed. Specific taxes are simple to collect, while ad valorem taxes are prone to disputes over valuation, and the amount of tax revenue is subject to fluctuations in prices, which is particularly inconvenient. Third, in terms of protection effectiveness, specific taxes are reliable and certain. The difference between domestic and foreign prices is fixed and unchangeable. Conversely, ad valorem taxes often change with the price of goods. If the price increases, the tax rate increases, which may excessively hinder trade. If the price decreases, the tax rate decreases, which can easily be exploited by those who dump goods. For example, if the original price of a certain item is ten dollars per unit and the ad valorem tax is 40% of its value, the tax is four dollars. If the price rises to fifteen dollars, 40% of its value would be six dollars. If the price increase is already difficult to reconcile, raising the tax rate is like adding insult to injury. Conversely, if the price falls to five dollars, 40% of its value is only two dollars. If the price falls to two and a half dollars, 40% of its value is only one dollar. If the sharp price reduction is already intolerable for domestic manufacturers, the tax rate is also invisibly reduced, which is like adding wings to a tiger. Since both ad valorem and specific taxes have their advantages and disadvantages, some combine these two forms, which is (Ad Valorem and Specific). For example, a felt hat is three dollars per dozen plus 20% of its value. There are two tax rates. This form can have the advantages of both ad valorem and specific taxes, but also inherits the disadvantages of both, and the calculation is more complex. However, the tax rate gradually increases with the rise in the price of goods and gradually decreases with the fall in the price of goods. It is neither as inflexible as specific taxes nor as extreme as ad valorem taxes. Within a reasonable range, it benefits tax revenue, which other forms cannot match. As for the (Ad Valorem or Specific) form, both ad valorem and specific tax rates are listed, and the higher one is adopted (the lower one is rarely adopted, because the power of choice will shift to the merchants). For example, a felt hat is 40% of its value ad valorem, but not less than five dollars per dozen. This form is ad valorem for high-end goods and specific for low-end goods, which does not hinder the trade of high-end goods while preventing the influx of cheap goods, making it most effective in protecting emerging industries. In addition to the above four forms, there are also so-called (Sliding Scale Tariffs) and (Quota Tariffs). (Sliding Scale Tariffs) vary their tax rates according to seasonal changes or price fluctuations, with the aim of regulating production and sales and equalizing prices. They are mostly applied to agricultural products. For example, fruit tariffs are raised during the autumn harvest and lowered during the lean season. Similarly, grain tariffs are raised when domestic prices are low and lowered or waived when prices are high. (Quota Tariffs) stipulate the annual or quarterly import quantity. Imports within the quantity limit are subject to a lower tax rate, and the tax rate is raised or imports are prohibited after the quota is met. The aim is also to protect industries, and they are mostly applied to industrial products. Upon closer examination of the nature of these two tax rates, the different tax rates are not implemented simultaneously. However, the increase or decrease in tax rates is more flexible than ordinary revisions. The form of the tax rate still falls within the four categories listed above. The variations of tax rate forms are roughly as described above. As for which one should actually be adopted, there is no definite method. It can be said that specific taxes are suitable for bulk goods with similar prices, while ad valorem taxes are suitable for scattered goods with significant price differences. If the intention is to protect industries or prevent the dumping of cheap goods, the forms of (Specific) and (Ad Valorem or Specific) should be used as much as possible. If the intention is to increase fiscal revenue and the percentage tax rate is very high, the forms of (Ad Valorem) or (Ad Valorem and Specific) can be used.</p>
<p>(4) "Rate Setting" refers to setting the specific numerical values of the tax rates. The setting methods can be roughly divided into (Direct) and (Indirect). The (Direct Method) directly stipulates the tax amount per unit. The level of the numerical value is determined by comparing the production costs or sales prices of imported and domestic products. The main aim of this method is to protect industries from undue pressure from imported products. The increase or decrease in tax revenue is not given much importance. The (Indirect Method) first stipulates the level of percentage for each category of goods. For example, the tax rate for luxury goods should be high, the tax rate for necessities should be low, the tax rate for manufactured luxury goods should be the highest, and the tax rate for essential raw materials should be the lowest. If the form of the tax rate is not suitable for ad valorem, it is converted based on the standard dutiable value. For example, if the percentage for a certain product is set at 30% of its value, and the standard price is twenty dollars per unit, then the specific tax rate should be six dollars. The calculation of the standard dutiable value is based on the domestic market price, with a deduction for tax rates and commissions, or based on the foreign market price, with an addition for freight and other items, depending on the circumstances. In theory, both methods aim to obtain the price of the goods when they arrive at the customs, and the principles are not different. However, regardless of which method is used to calculate the price, the results must be adjusted. There are two meanings to adjusting prices. First, there are many types of goods. No matter how precise the categorization, it is impossible to give each brand a single tax rate. Different brands with varying prices are grouped into one category, and the change in the sales volume of each brand is sufficient to affect the rise and fall of the average price. This rise and fall is not a real rise and fall in the price of goods. It is difficult to take it as a standard when calculating tax rates. Otherwise, the sales volume of high and low brands will often change, and the tax rate will also increase and decrease repeatedly, which is meaningless. Second, comparing the prices of each category, there may be abnormal and unreasonable prices. For example, imported processed goods may be mostly low-end, while unprocessed goods may be mostly high-end. If the specific tax rate is calculated based on actual figures, the tax rate for processed goods may be lower than that for unprocessed goods, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the principles of setting tax rates. In this situation, even if the calculated price is known to be reliable, the price of processed goods must be appropriately raised, or the price of unprocessed goods must be appropriately lowered. Once the price has been adjusted, the calculated tax rate cannot be without discrepancies. Those who do not understand the actual situation may point out that the valuation is inconsistent, but it is actually limited by the facts and there is no other choice. To avoid this kind of entanglement, a (Comparative Addition Method) can be adopted, which transcends the price of the goods. It stipulates that processed goods should be taxed according to unprocessed goods, with an additional amount. The additional amount may be a percentage of the value of the goods, or a percentage of the tax rate of the unprocessed goods, or a specific form of a certain amount per unit. This additional method can be said to be a variation of adopting a direct rate-setting method within an indirect rate-setting method. The above is a rough explanation of the two types of rate-setting methods, direct and indirect. Generally, the indirect method is applicable to ordinary goods, and the direct method is applicable to a small number of special items. The former is extensive, the latter is precise; the former is stable, the latter is concise; the former is like the first draft of a drawing, outlining the distribution of tax rates, while the latter is a detailed description of a certain part. The tariff items are numerous, and studying them in detail is not possible in practice. Where to apply direct methods for precise calculation, where to use indirect methods for a rough approximation, or to make slight modifications, all depend on the tariff policy. However, the so-called tariff policy is nothing more than deducing from the facts. In terms of protecting industries, it seems that the higher the tax rate, the better. However, excessive protection only increases the burden on consumers, leading to the drawbacks of shoddy manufacturing, or even hindering the development of other industries. In terms of tax revenue, it seems obvious that an increase in the tax rate leads to more tax revenue, but this is not always the case. If the tax rate is increased excessively, the import quantity may decrease, or it may lead to smuggling and tax evasion. Not only does the tax revenue not increase, but it may even decrease. Therefore, setting tax rates must first have a considerable understanding of the domestic and foreign production and sales conditions, and then consider the situation of producers, consumers, administration, and tax revenue. Choose a suitable position from the lowest tax-free point to the highest prohibitive point. Even if it is not possible to reach the precise point where an increase of one point is impossible and a decrease of one point is impossible, there should be a considerable calculation. Otherwise, relying solely on intuition and acting arbitrarily, there are few who do not fail.</p>
<h3 id="e241">The Process of National Import Tariffs <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Guang</p>
<p>When the National Government announced tariff autonomy on July 23, 1927, a Provisional Regulation on National Import Tariffs was drafted, scheduled to be implemented on July 1. However, Britain and Japan were the first to oppose it, and it was not implemented. In June 1928, the country was unified. The National Government, realizing the ineffectiveness of merely declaring tariff autonomy, changed its policy and sought to achieve tariff autonomy through treaty revision. Therefore, it adopted two methods, abolishing treaties and revising treaties, and proceeded separately. After negotiations, various countries gradually complied. The treaties signed by the National Government with various countries in 1928 are listed below:</p>
<p>Treaty for the Adjustment of Tariff Relations Between the United States and China… July 25, 1928</p>
<p>Sino-German Treaty… August 17, 1928</p>
<p>Sino-Norwegian Tariff Treaty… November 12, 1928</p>
<p>Sino-Polish Tariff Treaty… November 19, 1928</p>
<p>Sino-Swedish Tariff Treaty… December 20, 1928</p>
<p>Sino-British Tariff Treaty… December 20, 1928</p>
<p>Sino-French Tariff Treaty… December 22, 1928</p>
<p>Tariff Clauses of the Sino-Belgian Treaty… November 22, 1928</p>
<p>Tariff Clauses of the Sino-Italian Treaty… November 27, 1928</p>
<p>Tariff Clauses of the Sino-Danish Treaty… December 12, 1928</p>
<p>Tariff Clauses of the Sino-Portuguese Treaty… December 12, 1928</p>
<p>Tariff Clauses of the Sino-Spanish Treaty… December 27, 1928</p>
<p>Since the National Government had signed tariff clauses with various countries, tariff autonomy could have been realized sooner. However, Japan made things difficult, causing delays for a very long time, with almost no results. China then based on the relatively easy-to-implement seven different tax rates, and set a transitional tax rate, which is the Customs Import Tariff promulgated on December 7, 1928, and decided to be implemented from February 1, 1929. In May 1930, China and Japan signed a reciprocal tariff agreement. The National Tariff Commission then recompiled the new tariff, which the National Government promulgated on December 29, 1930, and implemented from January 1 of the following year.</p>
<p>In May 1933, when the three-year term of the Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Tariff Agreement expired, the Chinese authorities, in view of the actual needs, revised and reorganized the 1930 import tariff in its entirety, which took effect on May 22.</p>
<p>This revised national import tariff was able to express the spirit of tariff autonomy. The tax rates for cotton cloth and its products, rayon and its products, aquatic products, tobacco and alcohol, and other goods were specially increased. The tax rates for rayon and alcohol were increased from 30-50% to 80%. The tax rates for various fish and seafood products were increased by an average of more than two times.</p>
<p>Up to June of this year, in order to protect domestic industry and commerce and maintain international trade, the Chinese financial authorities have increased or decreased the customs import tariff, which has been revised and promulgated by the National Government and implemented on July 2. The classification number of the new tariff is the same as before, with no changes. The increases and decreases in the new tax rates for various goods are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e243">Japan's Trade with China <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Pei</p>
<p>Japan's trade with China has traditionally been dominated by cotton goods, sugar, paper, cotton yarn, wheat flour, machinery, and aquatic products. Since the Great War, there haven't been significant shifts. Among these, cotton goods have consistently ranked first among goods exported to China, except for 1928. Sugar, paper, and wheat flour compete for the second position. Coal and steel are also major commodities. The following is a table illustrating the changes in Japan's exports to China:</p>
<p>Changes in Japanese Goods Exported to China Over the Years (Figures in Gold Units)</p>
<p>Year   | First Place | Second Place | Third Place | Fourth Place | Fifth Place | Sixth Place | Seventh Place | Eighth Place</p>

<p>Regarding the past two years, cotton goods were the top Japanese export to China in 1931, totaling 65,257,731 gold units, accounting for 72% of China's total cotton goods imports and 24.8% of Japan's total cotton goods exports. This illustrates the significant role of cotton goods in both China's cotton goods import trade and Japan's cotton goods export trade. Paper products were second, totaling 16,826,371 gold units, accounting for 43.5% of China's total paper imports. Sugar was third, totaling 15,938,965 gold units. Following these were wheat flour, coal, cotton, machinery, electrical materials, aquatic products, rice, and timber. In 1932, affected by the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, Japanese cotton goods exports to China significantly decreased, amounting to only 38,284,523 gold units, but still maintained the top position among Japanese goods exported to China. Wheat flour was second, totaling 8,234,889 gold units. The subsequent order was sugar, paper, steel, aquatic products, coal, cotton, timber, rayon, and machinery. Generally, compared to 1931, all showed a sharp decline. A detailed table is provided below:</p>

Most transactions were halted, and prices remained largely unchanged. Slight fluctuations were minimal. The interest rate for overnight loans remained at 5%, both in the morning and afternoon. Overnight loan transactions totaled over 2.8 million, with new transactions exceeding 100,000 in the morning and over 100,000 in the afternoon. Transactions in small local associations exceeded 100,000. Money shops received over 32.2 million in foreign public bills and over 200,000 in remittances. The price of fractional currency remained within a few cents. The price of Jiangnan silver dollars was 836 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, a slight increase of 5 cents compared to the previous day, with no transactions due to the holiday.

<h3 id="e245">Securities: Bond Market Soars Last Week丨New High Prices Appear Continuously丨 <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>From July 2nd to July 7th last week, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange only conducted four days of trading, excluding Monday and Tuesday due to exchange settlement. Starting from the 4th, afternoon trading was suspended due to the scorching weather. The brisk trading and high market conditions were unprecedented. The anticipated high prices were reached within a day or two, exceeding the expectations of short sellers and the desires of long buyers. The ability of consolidated salt tax bonds to surge after reaching a 70% discount, abruptly and fiercely, was truly beyond the norm. Short sellers who sold at high prices consistently failed. Although there were various reasons such as the Ministry of Finance's inventory check, the 1996 reorganization, the Ping-Shen railway opening, and Sino-Japanese peace talks, these were all common knowledge and not new developments. The rumors of a new Sino-American loan agreement and the establishment of new tariff rates, along with Premier Wang's formal talks on reorganizing domestic and foreign debt, were more influential than previous rumors. As the balance continued to accumulate, short sellers increased, leading to successive surges in prices. As prices increased, some short sellers covered their positions, while others sold off, causing prices to rise even further. The eagerness of short sellers led to repeated surges, almost forgetting the high discount, creating a peak effect. New high prices seemed endless. In the near future, a sharp decline is unlikely, as market sentiment remains highly enthusiastic. Last week, Monday and Tuesday were settlement days with no trading. On Wednesday, after the market reopened, prices were relatively stable, showing signs of consolidation. On Thursday, half-day trading began, coinciding with rumors of the 1996 reorganization, boosting market sentiment. The 1996 bonds surged by over one yuan. The upward trend continued on Friday, with buyers showing no hesitation and prices rising sharply by several cents to about two yuan. On Saturday, the upward momentum remained strong, with various bonds reaching new highs. The surge was remarkable, with 1996 bonds rising sharply by over two yuan. As a result, the week saw gains ranging from over one yuan to over four yuan, with a total transaction volume of 87,675,000 yuan. The results are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e246">Weekend New York Stock Market Stagnant <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>New Feng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (7th), the low trading volume in the New York stock market was unprecedented in eleven years. Many traders were away for the weekend. The market initially opened firm due to positive business news, including a surge in steel production in the Youngstown area. Last week's production was only 20%, but it is expected to reach 30% next week. The firm's New York agent reported that the (securities) market was sluggish, with slightly higher prices expected next week. The (grain) market could not continue to ignore the ongoing selling pressure. (Cotton) prices initially fell due to lower prices in Liverpool and profit-taking by bulls, as well as predictions of rain in the eastern and central cotton-producing regions of the United States. The weather in Texas was generally good, but the central and southern regions remained dry, halting the selling pressure. Traders are now awaiting the cotton acreage report next Monday. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>|             | July 6 | July 7 | Change |</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton prices weakened due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, rain in the drought-stricken areas, and an increase in sellers. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 4 points. English cotton futures fell by 5 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to European merchants buying, but later weakened due to speculative selling and long liquidation. As a result, Ping-er fell by half a rupee, Oomra fell by one and a half rupees, and Bai-luo-xi fell by one rupee and seven and a half cents. The original telegram is recorded below (dated 7th):</p>

<p>Ji Feng Ying Hong Oil, produced in Changde, is known for its exquisite color. Although its history is not long, its sales have spread throughout the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, covering a wide area. The production volume this year is similar to last year. The first batch of 2,000 to 3,000 pieces was sold at a price above 23 yuan. Yesterday, another batch opened at a price of 22.8 yuan, with approximately 1,100 pieces sold, slightly cheaper than the first batch. This was not what the merchants initially desired, but due to the severe drought, sales may not be strong in the short term. Therefore, they made slight adjustments to stimulate the interest of buyers, which is a common strategy. However, as it is currently a busy time for farming, farmers are focusing all their efforts on watering and irrigating their fields and may not have the capacity for other activities. It is feared that strong tung oil sales will only occur after a significant rainfall. The quantity of goods taken in by local firms in recent days has not been large, so they are not in a hurry to sell, only preparing to build up their inventory.</p>

<h3 id="e251">On the "China-Japan Brothers" Theory <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Tang</p>
<p>The newspaper reports Yan Huiqing's remarks, saying that he once told the Japanese that China and Japan are brothers, and the only major yellow-skinned countries existing in the East are China and Japan. Therefore, they should cooperate to achieve coexistence and co-prosperity. In terms of race, China and Japan are indeed brothers; the major yellow-skinned countries existing in the East are indeed China and Japan, and they are also the only remaining yellow-skinned countries. In terms of race, China and Japan should indeed help each other to achieve coexistence and co-prosperity. Even the Japanese often shout that China and Japan should coexist and co-prosper, but the result is that the Japanese hope to dominate East Asia, overwhelm the Chinese people, and achieve the sole existence and prosperity of their country. How did this come about?</p>
<p>In theory and in practice, China and Japan should cooperate to promote the development of East Asians in East Asia. However, the Japanese insist on oppressing the Chinese people, talking about some kind of East Asian Monroe Doctrine, allowing this vast China to be solely dominated by them. There is a definite reason for this. The reason is that a small number of wealthy Japanese, nobles, and superiors hope to obtain a larger source of wealth in China to seek the so-called development of their empire. This is why they want to monopolize China. These few wealthy Japanese, nobles, and superiors, because they have exploited the people enough in their own country, and the dying Japanese farmers and laborers can no longer be exploited by them, therefore, the clever wealthy Japanese and others have to think of ways to exploit abroad. This is one of the motives for their invasion abroad. Furthermore, the increase in the status of wealthy Japanese is also necessarily linked to external exploitation in principle. This is also a definite fact. Therefore, the fact that Japanese (of course, a minority) oppress the Chinese is determined by definite historical reasons. It is not that some Japanese are bad, or that the Chinese should be specially exploited, but the relationship of money that forces them to do so. Understanding this, the so-called racial views have absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>The Japanese invasion of China is entirely for the sake of money. Therefore, whether the Japanese and Chinese are brothers, how to be brothers, what kind of people are brothers, and whether the so-called brothers should be distinguished by money are all questions that can be completely understood. That is to say, the so-called brothers should definitely be distinguished by money. The majority of the Japanese people (the awakened people) are oppressed and deceived by a small number of wealthy Japanese. Similarly, the majority of the Chinese people are also oppressed and deceived by a small number of wealthy Japanese. In this way, from the standpoint of being oppressed and deceived, the majority of the Chinese people and the majority of the Japanese people can become brothers and friends. In fact, this is indeed the case. Conversely, a small number of wealthy Japanese and a small number of Japanese warlords who live by money, if they can suddenly realize and not invade the Chinese people, not oppress and deceive the Chinese people, and make no distinction between countries, can also become brothers. But I wonder if it is possible?</p>

<p>— He Juefu</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Guangzhou must have a deep impression of the teahouses in Guangzhou!</p>
<p>Speaking of the teahouses in Guangzhou, there are so many that it is really hard to count. You can find them everywhere, whether on the streets or in the alleys. Even in the nearby villages, you can often find two or three thatched tea sheds.</p>
<p>In Guangzhou, drinking tea has become a fashion among the people there, and it can also be said to be an indispensable expense in the daily lives of a group of people. Even if you are not a big fan of drinking tea, as long as you live there for three or five weeks, I guarantee you will gradually be assimilated by them and become addicted.</p>
<p>With so many teahouses and so many people drinking tea, someone who doesn't know the real situation in Guangzhou would surely think that the lives of the people there are so comfortable. But the actual situation is not as beautiful as imagined. The abundance of teahouses and the large number of customers only reveal the boredom and monotony of the lives of the people there. Because a group of people without a proper job and without a lot of money think that (time) is worthless, even worse than getting through it. Since they feel painful to be trapped alone in their lodgings and do not have much money to go to the major entertainment venues to have fun, they have no choice but to go to a teahouse, invite two or three friends to chat and drink tea, and pass the boring years. Moreover, the facilities in Guangzhou's teahouses seem to be designed specifically for these people. In front of every teahouse, there must be a stall renting out all kinds of newspapers, large and small; the seats in each teahouse are so many that it is impossible to count them all. No matter how many hours you sit there, the boss will never show any sign of wanting you to leave; some even set up a stage in the middle of the guest seats and hire one or two actresses and a band to sing and play, for the enjoyment of the customers. As long as you spend a dime or two, rent one or two newspapers, order a pot of tea, a plate of melon seeds, and a plate of snacks, you can leisurely and comfortably drink tea, shell melon seeds, read the newspaper, and listen to music all day long. Who wouldn't enjoy such a life?</p>
<p>If it is a sweltering hot day, the business of the teahouse will be even busier. Because teahouses are mostly skyscrapers, the air is cooler, and there are also electric fans spinning non-stop. If one's pockets weren't empty, who would want to be confined in a small lodging and suffer from the heat?</p>
<p>It wouldn't be much of an exaggeration to say that Guangzhou's teahouses are the headquarters of the middle class without a fixed occupation! Because that's where the majority of them are.</p>

<h3 id="e253">In the Sweltering Heat <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Four or five men, bare-chested, their backs scorched red, beads of sweat hanging all around their heads, hanging down to their necks, shoulders, chests... There, a thick rope was thrown around the base of their necks, heavy, seemingly embedded into the flesh. Under the scorching sun, they were going up the bridge, (Pull! Pull!) The one behind, blocking the wheels, shouted desperately, his throat about to explode! The four or five in front glanced at each other, frowning (If we pull ourselves to death, that's it.) Everyone resented in their hearts, they had to eat, there was no other way to think.</p>
<p>A pile of steel bars, scorched hot by the sun, the iron wheels pressed against the melting asphalt bridge surface, stuck fast and couldn't move. They used all their strength, almost pushing their heads to the ground, every vein strained taut under their skin. Their shorts were soaked through with sweat. The trolleybus followed closely behind, ringing its bell, and behind that was a car, a grass-green body, a cream-colored awning, a steel spare tire cover, a three-toned horn, the most popular sports car of the summer.</p>
<p>It just sat there idling, the scorching sun not reaching the people in the car. The people in the car were so lucky. They shouted:</p>
<p>(What's going on? Why is the car in front stopping all the time!) It was a woman's shrill voice.</p>
<p>(Maybe another car broke down.) A man replied gently.</p>
<p>(It'll be late getting to Wusong.)</p>
<p>(It'll be cooler at night!)</p>
<p>A hand in a white glove gripped the steering wheel, an American-style straw hat rested on the side, a starched shirt clung snugly to his chest, in the style of a movie star, a Chevrolet smile pasted on his face, and a strong Chesterfield burned at the corner of his mouth. The other hand stretched behind the woman's back,</p>
<p>rolling a pair of talkative eyes.</p>
<p>She leaned wearily against the spring leather cushions, a pair of two-inch-long earrings dangling;</p>
<p>(Darling, can't we get past them?</p>
<p>I can't stand the heat coming in from the street.)</p>
<p>As if receiving an imperial edict, the car crept past the trolleybus as the steering wheel turned. The iron wheels of the cart had just started to move when the head of the one pulling the cart at the front was smashed in by the car, spurting crimson, hot blood, blood, blood... under the intense sun.</p>
<p>The injured one rolled to the side of the bridge, the uninjured ones stopped the car, wiping the sweat from their foreheads into the car, stretching their thick, black arms in front of their faces, (Pay for his life! Pay for his life! Pay for his life!)</p>
<p>He naturally threw away the cigarette butt (Call the police!)</p>
<p>A policeman squeezed into the crowd, with no surprised expression on his face. He calmly took out a notebook, (What to do? Go to the station together, or...?)</p>
<p>Then he took out a card (If there's anything, you can notify us.)</p>
<p>(But, sir, you have to send the injured person to the hospital.)</p>
<p>(Well... please figure it out. We can't waste our time.)</p>
<p>Saying that, the engine roared under his feet, and without a single word of apology, he drove off.</p>
<p>The policeman clipped the card into his notebook and hired a rickshaw to take the injured person to the hospital, under the scorching sun.</p>
<p>Those who weren't hit still had to pull, the wheels rolling over the purple bloodstains on the asphalt (Pull! Pull!) Glancing at each other, frowning (If we pull ourselves to death, that's it.) Everyone resented in their hearts, they had to eat, there was no other way to think.</p>
<p>On Jungong Road, the evening breeze blew in summer, the sweltering heat had retreated, and leisurely yachts floated in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>The car, with its green body, cream-colored awning, and three-toned horn, the hand in the white glove gripped the steering wheel, the man, with a Chevrolet smile on his face, the woman, with her wandering, talkative eyes:</p>
<p>(Darling, can't you drive a little faster?)</p>
<h3 id="e254">Summer Vacation Bewilderment <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Bulu</p>
<p>According to reports: This summer, college graduates in Peiping, unable to bear the bewilderment after graduation, recently organized a "Vocational Movement Grand Alliance." The purpose of this alliance is roughly two points: (1) To defeat unemployment; (2) To indirectly hint at the need for reform of higher education.</p>
<p>In this situation of widespread unemployment, it seems that college students have no way out, which is a natural phenomenon. But if we examine it a little, we feel that this is somewhat ridiculous. We all know that our country is backward in everything. The main reason for this is the lack of talent. We also know that in our country, those who can study to graduate from college are all privileged individuals. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics, in proportion to the population, they account for only one person in every ten thousand. This is such a precious figure. It seems that society should make use of this batch of rare talents in some way. But in fact, the opposite is true. On the one hand, they are shouting that there is no talent, and on the other hand, talent is unemployed. This phenomenon cannot but be said to be ridiculous and incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Why is there such a contradiction? Here, we cannot but ask such an urgent question.</p>
<p>As far as schools are concerned, it is undeniable that the current Chinese education system is an education system that creates young masters and misses, an education system that is completely divorced from real society, and an education system that is consumption-oriented rather than production-oriented. The graduates created by this kind of education system spend several years and exchange it for a piece of paper, a diploma. The value only arises from the diploma, but the diploma cannot represent knowledge. With such talents, in the current stage of Chinese society, of course, there is no ability to assume any responsibility. However, a part of society that needs real talent still laments the difficulty of finding talent.</p>
<p>Let's talk about society. Like market monopolies and oligopolies under capitalism, any organization, under the leadership of someone, is completely dominated by his cronies. As long as they are from the same hometown, classmates, members of the same party, or relatives through marriage, they can all benefit from his blessings. On the other hand, if you want to find a job, without relying on the power of your parents and brothers, without relying on the recommendation of wealthy people, without relying on the assistance of people from the same hometown, classmates, and political party, without relying on the internal help of relatives through marriage, but only relying on your own real knowledge and training, then that is a dream. This is the real situation. The occupational distribution of this society is extremely uneven.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot absolutely blame either side for the fact that college graduates have no way out, but looking around at the current reality in China, these two phenomena are expressed simultaneously in this society, which no one can deny.</p>
<p>In this way, the organization of this alliance by college graduates in Peiping is, in our opinion, a noteworthy event. At least, we express our full sympathy for the fact that they are taking responsibility for their own problems. For the two goals they put forward, defeating unemployment is of course the current urgent task of college graduates, and suggesting the reform of higher education is even more important for the future of China!</p>
<h3 id="e255">Little Yan's Sorrow <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ding</p>
<p>Time seemed to flow by like lightning. It had been a full eighteen years since Little Yan was bought into the Zhang family.</p>
<p>She was only thirty-six full months old from the time she was born in her mother's womb until she left home.</p>
<p>Therefore, Little Yan really knew very little about her family's affairs and her own life experience. Time was so short for her, what could she possibly know?</p>
<p>However, in her mind, there was still a vague impression:</p>
<p>On the vast land in the fields, leaning towards the south, wasn't there a cluster of deep green jungle? In this jungle, weren't there a few low, dilapidated thatched cottages? The one with a few pine trees in front of the door, that was her home.</p>
<p>What exactly did her father look like? She couldn't recognize him clearly, but there was a person of about forty years of age, with a face full of beard, hair that grew strangely long, tied into a braid on top of his head, a flat face, the color of which was yellowish and black.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>, like old orange peel, eyes that were sunken and without any brilliance, teeth that were dirty and yellow, and his mouth often emitted a kind of suffocating smell. He wasn't tall, but he wasn't considered short either, and he always wore this broken black cloth jacket. He spoke in a very heavy voice, liked to drink, often caused trouble, and seemed very fierce, but in reality, he wasn't like that.</p>
<p>Another woman, with a sad and bitter face all day long, that was her mother.</p>
<p>Her impression of her mother was relatively deep, and she seemed to have a special feeling for her mother. In her mother's body, she often smelled a kind of maternal scent. She loved her mother, liked her mother, because her mother directly raised her, loved her so much, cared for her, and comforted her.</p>
<p>Even now, she seemed to still remember her mother's face, her mother's voice, and the many songs that her mother often sang to her. She would never forget her mother. Little Yan felt that her mother was good, that her mother was so lovable!</p>
<p>However, this was only a vague impression. When Little Yan was so young, when she was picking up some scraps of information from her mother's mouth, it was also the time when her hometown suffered a terrible disaster. In order to support their two old lives, in order to pay off those debts that could never be paid off, her parents had no choice but to sell this, their only asset—Little Yan—to the Zhang family in town.</p>
<p>From that time on, they struggled with difficult and hard days. And Little Yan also gradually grew up in the Zhang family's relatively well-off living environment. At first, when she didn't understand the world, Little Yan was like a little bird, without restraint, soaring freely in the sky. The owner of the Zhang family loved her very much. Now that she had become an adult, she looked even better than when she was a child, and she knew more things.</p>
<p>Troubles and misfortunes then gradually, gradually approached her day by day.</p>
<p>The mistress began to have a kind of extreme jealousy towards her, so she especially abused her, ruined her, and made her live a life worse than that of cattle and horses day and night. And Master Zhang, on the other hand, had long harbored a wild ambition towards her, so behind his wife's back, he especially approached her, using sweet words and threats to seduce her, sparing no effort in his techniques.</p>
<p>At this moment, she was fighting with pain. From the mouth of the old nanny, she learned what kind of people the Zhang family were, learned about her situation, and learned about her terrible fate in the future. So she thought of her family, thought of her parents who were sold them their daughter because they were starving and freezing, and of the situation she herself was currently in, and couldn't help but feel a deep chill. She was determined to run away secretly, but where could she escape to? She hesitated, uncertain. There was no home, and she didn't know whether her parents were alive or dead. She might not even recognize them anymore.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Mother <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>Last night, I dreamed of my dead mother, just like she was alive, with a kind smile on her face.</p>
<p>Immediately, I seemed to know that I was in a dream, I seemed to know that this dream would soon wake up. I threw my body into her arms. Like a child, I looked up and sat on her face, my right index finger held in my lips, and I happily called out (Mom)!</p>
<p>Mother stroked my hair with her hand, and the faint, gentle, familiar lullaby echoed in my ears again.</p>
<p>(Mom, I want to be in your arms forever, hypnotized by the sweet sound of your song; seeing your kind smile. Mom, let's never be separated!)</p>
<p>Mother smiled slightly, without saying a word.</p>
<p>(Mom, my younger brother has grown up, and my younger sister can also jump and run. They are all so cute. Mom, do you know?)</p>
<p>Mother was still smiling, without answering.</p>
<p>(Mom, I have a lover! She is a beautiful girl. She can also laugh and sing. She has black hair and bright eyes! Mom, are you happy?)</p>
<p>Mother nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>I lowered my head and thought for a while, I was thinking of some happy things to report to my mother. My heart was full of happiness, and my throat was also filled with words. But, I couldn't say it... I smiled and didn't speak! I looked at my mother, and my mother also looked at me. Really, when had we ever been separated! Wasn't my mother still smiling so kindly?</p>
<p>(Mom, this must not be a dream!)</p>
<p>Then I woke up, my hand dragging the corner of the quilt.</p>

<h3 id="e258">Worse Than Death <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— San Duo</p>
<p>Currently, dead people's heads are being sold in bulk on the market. We don't need to give examples. Just pay attention to the news about "death," and dead people's heads are moved to the market in the fastest spin cycle. First, to take advantage of the fact that customers still remember that this dead person's head is the latest, and second, dead people's heads will sell, each with different speeds, so it is first come, first served. Making a fortune from dead people is precisely the shortest path to wealth in a sluggish market. However, what is being bought and sold is (future contracts.) I once dreamed that if I really put this dead person's head on the market, the grand occasion would be even more imaginable, but the people who do magic tricks don't have that ability. Because they are Changshan comrades, they have to maintain the dignity of Changshan. If they nakedly sold dead people's heads, wouldn't they collapse the stage for Changshan comrades? So this good business was imitated by the duanshan comrades of another class, who dug up other people's ancestral graves.</p>
<p>It is said that the trend of kidnapping for ransom was wholesale imported from American movies to China. A pistol kidnaps a person without a trace. Such a good, once-and-for-all business is naturally something that the people of the gold-dollar country could not have imagined. However, since there is attack in the art of war, there must be defense. Therefore, those who are qualified to be kidnapped hire Russian bodyguards with pistols. In this way, although it is not certain that they will not be kidnapped, it is ultimately more difficult to do so.</p>
<p>This point is naturally where our Chinese are cleverer, digging up other people's ancestral graves. Since the dead don't know how to resist, and they don't have strict defenses, they put the bones of the dead anywhere and ask for hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is ten thousand times higher than selling dead people's heads with empty promises.</p>
<p>However, once this trend starts, many ancestral graves with status cannot be built in the dragon's veins of scenic places. Isn't this giving the bandits an opportunity? They should immediately move to the bustling areas of the concession, build high walls, build large buildings, hire bodyguards, and raise police dogs to prevent the theft of the bones of the dead!</p>

<p>— Xijun</p>
<p>Just whispering, whispering, whispering behind the black robe. Smoking, listening to a pair of hurried Tangos played on the flute, browsing the bright fleshy scenery in front. Sexual sensation received intense stimulation, becoming increasingly unbearable. To resist the outbreak of this malaise, he sometimes unconsciously closed his eyes. He only allowed his auditory senses to be intoxicated by a slow and graceful Waltz, and Karl had reached a point where he had to dance, he was simply mad, he said:</p>
<p>丨丨 Hey, let's have a pair.</p>
<p>丨丨 He's got the malaise again.</p>
<p>丨丨 It's better not to come than to sit here doing nothing!</p>
<p>The lights went out, and Karl opened the record first.</p>
<p>Karl usually exaggerates his sexual sublimation, but with an exquisite and smooth body in front of him, he can prevent sexual cells from blooming. But at this moment, he was once again a conquered prisoner, the charm of sensory pleasure!</p>
<p>Yes, those who are tired of struggling in the torrent of life all love to use this implicit form to seek the discharge of sexual appetite, just like us together. Almost every night is spent immersed in these places, these places full of rich colors. But when the music is gone, the singing is gone, shoulders slumped, listlessly wandering on the lonely road home, listening to the night wind whistling through the leaves of the plane trees, the leaves falling one by one to the ground, far away, near and far, only you are sending off the chirping of the crickets in the sunset of youth, slowly drifting away, drifting away, at this time, the taste of loneliness poured into the heart only one's own self knows!</p>
