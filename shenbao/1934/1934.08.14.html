<p>日昨外電傳美國政府。已經公告白銀國有政策。公告内容。大體是要首先將美國境内市面存銀。限自八月九日以後三個月内一律解交造幣廠。規定官價爲每盎士美金五角零一釐（出礦生銀官價仍爲六角四分半。）美國如此大購白銀。不但引起了全世界的注目。對於我們以銀爲支付本位的國家更要發生絶大的影響。因此。我們當先根本認識美國白銀政策的眞實面目。然後才可以推測白銀國有政策的效力如何。　　從羅斯福登台以後。美政府的基本政府。就是在謀如何恢復金元王國在世界已經消失的繁榮。因此在貨幣政策方面。首先於一九三三年四月二十日脱離了金本位。一方面避免國内金融組織的崩潰。他方面加緊美國對於世界市塲的進攻。到了去年七月參與倫敦會議各大國的野心完全露後。羅斯福目擊世界危機依然不能消失。便决計雙管齊下。定了一個澈底的集中現金膨脹通貨的方針。去年十月下旬的購金運動。今年五月的購銀法案。以至最近白銀國有法令。都是根據着這個一貫精神而出發的。所謂通貨膨脹的實際意義。無非是一方面給工資成本一個折扣他方面則卽是抬高美國貨物在國際市塲中的競爭力量。原來自銀價抬高以後。一則用銀國市塲可以發生購買力增高一時的作用。二則（美元）對外匯價。在公告白銀國有并進行大量國外購銀的時候將因而日趨於跌落。這都是羅斯福（樂觀厥成）的貨幣政策的重要步驟。　　試問美國白銀政策。對於其他工業國家。必將發生怎樣的反響呢。在過去一年餘美國貨幣政策幾度演進的期間。英國的匯兌平準基金。增加了二萬萬鎊。而她同時對於（英鎊集團）的積極結合。亦不啻是助她發揮匯兌戰爭的重要工具。至於在法國領導之下的歐洲（金集團）國家。其所進行的國家財政緊縮計劃。以及减低工資利率房租等計劃。則是對抗美國貨幣政策的另一種集團現在美國旣然决意進行大量購銀方法。一方面不啻説明她在過去購金運動的目的。不曾完全實現。同時也指出她已開始向英法德意日。等工業國家作更尖鋭的市塲戰爭。不過像這樣熱烈的市塲戰爭只有加緊世界恐慌的可能。而對於購買力如何抬高一問題。却依然毫無解决的辦法　　上文已經説過美國白銀政策的基本目的。是在於恢復該國已經消失的繁榮。羅斯福在過去一年餘的政策。卽以此爲其出發點。然而成效如何。看最近幾個月美國工潮澎湃。就可以明白了。我們現在可由白銀收回國有的法令中。更看出羅斯福仍然不肯放棄其旣往的方針。我們雖不敢説這是（迴光返照）的現象。但也祗能承認是一種有力强心劑罷了</p>

<p>據俞秘書長云、吳市長籌欵百萬、擬廣建平民村舍之舉、現已積極進行中、吳市長對於進行此事之動機、蓋由鑒於本市貧民、爲數甚衆、若輩生活慘苦、而居處類均鄙陋不堪、或則草棚一椽、或則破船一隻、（即艒艒船）旣不足以禦狂風驟雨、而一遇火警、又輙不易收拾、此等貧民、可憐已極、市政當局、復以此等建築、旣屬形響市容、且碍公衆安全、累欲設法取締、而於取締</p>

<p>專門討論儲蓄銀行法第九條</p>
<p>國聞社云、本市各銀行、前以財政部頒布之儲蓄銀行法第九條、（儲蓄銀行、至少應有儲蓄存欵總額四分之一相當之政府公債庫劵、及其他担保確實之資産、交存中央銀行特設之保管庫、爲償還儲蓄存欵之担保、）並規定存欵總額、以每半年末日之結存總額爲準等條文、同業對於原則、表示遵從、至於施行辦法、尚須從詳研究、因推舉四明·綢業·國華·新華·金城·五銀行、組織小組會、籌議辦法、昨日中午十二時、五銀行代表駱清華·陳立廷·瞿季剛·胡錫安·孫瑞璜·及銀行公會秘書長林康侯等、在香港路銀行俱樂部叙餐、並會議關於儲蓄銀行第九條之應付辦法、僉以條文上交存中央銀行保管庫者、爲公債庫債及其他資産、而財部訓令、郤但有公債庫劵、並未提及其他資産、况公債庫劵、如遵部令、照市價核算、則市價時有漲落、而保管數量、遂亦須隨之增减等種種疑點、均應請求政府解釋及修訂、當經議决、（一）由同業公會具呈財政部、（二）呈文起草後、再行召集會議討論之、（三）定於本月十五日（星期三）再行開會、繼續討論、後對於此等貧民之安置辦法、初未顧及、吳市長有鑒及此、不覺惻焉憫之、於是决定籌欵百萬在本市滬西·浦東·南市·閘北·及其他各鄉區、廣建平民村舍、即以容納此等貧民、使其居身、有所、然後對於此有碍市容有碍公衆安全艒船棚户、予以取締、則旣不致影響於貧民之生活、而於改善市政一道、亦可易收實效也、</p>

<p>但茲事體大、需欵至少百萬、以市府最近之財政情形言、實覺力不勝任、但吳市長認爲此事無論如何、必當設法進行、故現已積極組織籌備委員會、並爲集思廣益起見、决聘請本市之中外名流、出任該會籌委、故此事實現、當不在遠、關於經費一層、現有辦法數點、或向商行界商洽借欵、或則與地方銀行界互相合作進行、現正考慮商洽之中也、該項平民村落之建築地點、將視各地情形而定、對於交通設備、及不致影響於貧民原有之職業生活一點、更當加以注意、至於房租一層、將來務以極低價格出賃、庶使貧民堪以負担、而符救濟之道也、</p>

<p>很多的讀者高興知道自己以外的人的讀書生活，這在交換各個人的讀書生活經騐上説，是有很重要的意義的。因爲一百個人即令同讀一樣的一本書，因爲各人的讀書生活不同，成績完全一致的事可説是極少的。因此，他人的經騐、不獨可供我們的參考，使我們可减少讀書過程中一些困難，並且也是鼓勵我們勇往前進，知道學問上的艱苦。　　所以，讀書經騐談之類的東西、一向就受人尊重的。　　現在且來談談我們五六百（以登記的爲限）讀者的讀書生活的一般現象罷！自然，我們知道的仍有限，不過，即就我們收到的僅有的材料而論，已可抽出如下的幾個重要點來，值得在道裏介紹的。　　第一，大家都是一面爲生活掙扎，一面在百忙中抽出一點時間讀書，生活指示了他們的讀書的目的與方向：並指示了修學的實踐的方法。他們在這奮鬥中，獲得了許多寳貴的經騐，逈非書本中可以得到者。　　第二，因爲讀書能按照以上的生活的實踐爲出發點，所以讀者的進益都非常迅速，書中難解的部分，他們每每於生活的實踐中找出答案了。這種現象，是學校教育中不易看見的。　　第三，他們打破了（要有好的環境，纔能讀書）的四書生氣味。他們因爲各自的生活的特殊性，在商店的櫃台後，工廠的車間裏，閒了寫，公共寢室，公園，電車、食店内，他們一遇到有空，就將書本拿出。能够善於利用環境，克服環境，打退了一切消極的情緒。　　第四，他們不知道一點則已，一知道一點了，就迫切的要求運用，好像不能運用書上的理論，書還是不能相信似的。　　第五，他們越讀越不知足，對我們提出的問題也越多、越複雜，最近有位杜洛基君向我們提出的疑問，寫成了一薄本寄來。可見讀者的疑問是要從（讀）中纔能發生，粗心的人，連疑問都是不會發生的。　　總之：我們的讀者都各自在前進。近兩月來眞是（一面在揮汗，一面在沉讀。）</p>

<p>登　　本刊第二十期内，曾刊有盧火君（談新詩歌創作專號）一文，現在接到（六兵士）的作者（六兵士）一詩是有帮助的。盧火先生：　　看到你的（談（新詩歌）創作專號）的文章，我想向你説幾句，因爲我就是（六士兵）的作，者。　　（合唱詩）這東西，一看我們就會明白它是來路貨一，據説在歐美是通行的，但我所見到的，是寫工人的，有没有寫士兵的，我不知道。在中國，聽説楊騷先生曾寫過？其結果，失敗抑是成功，没人知道，因爲他發表的地方就很少有人知道。　　繼（六士兵）後，我又寫…兩兄弟，防俄，醒來吧，滿洲！（這些東西或者會積在一塊和世人見面，但現在我不敢説。）都失敗了，其原因，也誠如先生所説（不能合唱的地方很多，唱起來也不緊張，聽不懂，有許多人物説的話就非要和做戲一般的先介紹出來不行。）爲什末要這樣呢？我得的經騐是這樣：　　譬如哥爾德的（一億二千萬），只要一張長方形的桌子就够了。但寫士兵的佈景就不同，首先不容易表演；尤其在中國寫東西困難，這首詩，原來我想三方面寫；戰景，長官，兵，但結果能够成爲（？）合唱的只是後面的一點點，前面的兩大段反成了累贅，這眞不能不説是（弄巧反拙）了！以後寫的幾首，是部份的改善了，但取材仍舊是士兵，所以又是失敗了。以我的失敗，告新的來者，（我希望（六士兵）能盡一點（抛碍引玉）的任務。）取材如不是萬不得已，請不要在士兵方面去取材，因爲這是極不容易寫好的。當然能够取材的東西多着呢。　　形式方面，我覺得最低限度是應該避免歐化，因爲寫者是中國人、讀者也是中國人，必要把自己的作品成爲讀者痛苦時的解毒劑。我相信，一個民族是有他獨具的特性的、就是説，形式不妨是民族的。　　寫進去的對白，最好是作者寫好後請幾個朋友來就地合唱，不妥的地方即時修改、這樣會成一首完美的大衆合唱詩也説不定。　　以上是我的意見。望祈能將道信登載。竇隠夫</p>

<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>我没有指斥文公直先生冒充代表，直接爲（康伯度）先生張目，暗地裏又爲西人侵略張目的企圖，但對於（中國語法裏要加一點歐化）的主張，是完全贊成的。尤其對於在翻譯和創作裏應用着的文學用語，爲丁（精密正確），語彚和語法底歐化有絶對的必要。</p>
<p>從前某先生説過，文言文底長處在含混糢糊，這是對的。白話文比文言文較（精密正確），歐化底成份便不能不多，大衆語比白話文更（精密正確），那麽中國語法將來一定更加歐化，是毫無疑問的了。</p>
<p>其實中國語法歐化，並不是從有了白話文，或有了康伯度先生底主張才開始的。梁啟超做的文言裏面，就有（烟土披里純）：在他之前，古文裏常用（梵語）；而對於廣東的機器工人，（士啤）（Ｓpare），（士派拉）（Spiral），（士胡衣紙（Switch）等字眼，二十年來，已經日常地成了他們底語言。這些人未必一定不受（帝國主義者的指使），何以文先生單單責難康伯度先生呢</p>
<p>中國目前的文學作品，大多數是一種含混模糊的槪念底游戲，很少能够具體地描寫出一把椅子，精微地刻畫出一個動作。幾乎完全没有用語言創造形象的能力。這恐怕是思想和文公直先生相近的人過多的原故吧。但一觸到西洋文學，則雖是順譯的東西，也不能缺少歐化的語彚和語法了。中國能希望有偉大作品産生麽？</p>
<p>歐化的起碼功夫是運用標點符號，這是人所共知的事。但這必要的起碼功夫，做來也就頗不容易，舉例説，（這我眞不知是從那里説起）這一句話，下面如果做個疑問號，就不能不算一個錯誤。文公直先生没有主張連標點符號都廢除，而且自己也在使用着，想來該是（必要）無疑，然而連這小小的地方都不曾會，可見中國人雖可以有用，話却不一定會説。</p>
<p>高爾基是會説話的，而且説得很好。他描寫過一個（失敗的著作家），我隨手抄兩句給大家看看吧</p>
<p>（青年説到這里，用他的嘴唇，把他那稀少而又）無光澤的上鬚，扭了一扭，半閉着兩隻又黄又白的憂鬱眼睛，用一隻發顫的手，很留神似的，自己斟了一杯白乾酒。）</p>
<p>（……他那鬆弛的兩頰上，布滿了許多小靜脈管構成的紅條子，他的鼻子中了酒毒，變成板栗色，露着悽慘的樣子，垂在上鬚上面。）（回憶瑣記：七五頁）</p>
<p>從這兩句例子，誰都可以看出中國語彚底貧弱和語法底殘缺，但仍能百分之幾地傳達出高爾基所要描寫的人物者，就全靠那個句子歐化了的原故。有誰肯用（純粹中國語彚語法）將那兩句話改説一遍的麽，他就會知道帝國主義者底眞心，恐怕倒希望中國人全用（古文）。假使對甚麽東西都只有一個含混糢糊的槪念，對帝國主義者底侵略行爲，自然也説得不清不楚的了。</p>
<h3 id="c211">歐化問題 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 先河</p>
<p>現在正是討論大衆語最起勁的當兒，反對文言文的文章已經很多，可是討論到歐化問題的却是非常缺少。</p>
<p>前幾天見到康伯度先生（玩笑只當牠玩笑），却是觸到這個問題的。這自然不能不説是可貴，可是因爲立論的含糊，很容易引起人家的誤會。</p>
<p>最大的遺憾，我以爲是康先生把攻擊歐化式白話這件正經的事，只當作是嘲笑。可是事實上，却决不如此。</p>
<p>我覺得反對歐化是應該的，因爲大衆所能懂的，决不是詰屈聱牙的歐化式白話。外國語的特點，是形容字很多，往往描摹一件簡單的東西，就要費去一連串的形容。這固然是（精密），同康先生所説的，但如果模仿得不當或過分，就變成了（蕪雜）。在外國語本身，當然是進步的東西，因爲牠能表達比較複雜的思想與感情。可是經過中國的作家們一模仿，却就成了牛頭不對馬嘴的垃圾堆了。現在市上出售的文藝書籍，不論打開那一本看，往往是滿眼的長句子，中間夾些不恰當甚至不連貫的（的）字，不用説這是刻意模仿的結果。尤其是新詩裏的十四行詩，簡直顚顚倒倒的裝得異常古怪，别説大衆，就連大學文科生也不會懂。這種現象的造成，大部人原因是由於作者好奇與盲目的崇外，倒並不是爲了固有的白話文不够用。其實是十分粗淺平凡的東西，却硬要拉一張燦爛耀目的外國虎皮，企圖遮醜，以至弄得不通或不順，難道這也是康先生所欲提倡的（精密）不成？</p>
<p>最重要的，是要把（神密）與（蕪雜）十分嚴格的區别開來。我們要求明確暢快的文字，去配合充實的内容，却反對拖泥帶水的歐化式白話。當然並我不是説絶對不能採納歐美近代的文體，而是攻擊目下正在流行着的，由一般作家學者硬模仿出來，未經融會貫通的新式八股文。</p>
<p>而且我這裏所指的是創作，翻譯却是應該寛容一點的。可是能够做到以（中國話）翻譯（外國語），而不以（變相歐語）翻譯（眞正歐語），自然是更所盼望。在這文化程度十分低落，而大衆已經渴望着智識的時候，我以爲容易了解是第一個要素。如果原很容易懂的一點材料，却給艱深晦澀的文字弄模糊了，無疑的是椿罪孽。翻譯固然要忠實，不能隨意改變或删改，但極力求其流暢簡潔，無論如何是個重要的條件，而且在事實上也是可能的。譬如曹靖華先生譯的（不走正路的安德倫），其譯筆就非常暢達，是個有力的例證。</p>
<p>至於康先生舉了幾個地名的例子，如（霞飛路）（麥特赫司脱路）等等，替歐化必要論辯護，我認爲是可笑的，因爲這並不是什麽（精密）。在現在創作界裏，趨時髦的作者老是愛塡上一批外國名字，以爲這才是複雜，才是新式，弄得不三不四。用（露絲）（曼莉）（娜娜）這些香艷的名字，代替了（小貓）（翠玉）（實釵，）是不是就是康先生所説的（精密）呢？</p>
<p>總之，我極力反對目下流行的白話八股，因爲他是離開民衆的，由智識分子生吞活剝地硬搬過來的一種形式。但我决計不是完全抹煞近代歐美文體帮助大衆語建立的作用，像頑固先生似的擁護國粹，因此我根本的主張是：把（歐化式白話）加以（揚棄）。</p>

<p>面孔人人皆有，自非（閲人多矣）或學到了些兒麻衣相法，是難分别好醜善惡的。相傳袁天罡善相，但對於李嶠的相便看了三日三夜，方得出結論來。可見這是多麽一種高深的（科學）了。</p>
<p>西洋是值得崇拜的、十九世紀初葉曾經流行過一種腦相學，和敝國的（揣骨相）大槪差不多。中國派遣留學生已經若干年，而至今没有給紹介這麽一種科學，與（科學靈乩）并美，可見留學生是怎樣不行的了。</p>
<p>但報章雜誌流行，照相術和工業進步，中外名人的肖像，映入吾輩之眼簾，大多觸目驚心，原來是這麽一個樣子！因爲種族之不同，東西洋人兩種截然不同的面貌也各有其美惡的看法吧。就其外表細心的觀察，也不難參透那表皮内所藴蓄的怎樣底一個靈魂。</p>
<p>不過看西洋人，無論政治首領，電影名星，文學家，哲學家……之流，或嚴肅，或瀟酒，皆約略看得出苦鬥的痕跡，有一種明顯的容顔。卽以政治人物而論，白里安之陋顔，墨索里尼之圓胖子，斯太林之大鼻，希特勒之愁眉，皆好像有一種使人不感覺模糊的特點，無論聰明愚蠢，奸巧率直，其表情終歸顯然，只有麥克唐納差一點，但虚僞之態可掬，也仍屬顯明的一類。</p>
<p>然一比較起敝國大人物小人物，名人要人，眞是不可同日而語了。這方面是模糊影響，不但旁人看不出什麽，好像連自己也憎惡那一副尊容。照在影片上，多半似笑猶顰，如嗔如喜，好像嚴肅而也滑稽，彷彿慈悲而又獰狠，浮烟似的，若隠若現了。</p>
<p>（徒有其表）也不可得，也足見内容之空虚。同種的日本人便不同的多，不過他們的樣兒有時好像做戲，表情又似乎很過火了。</p>

<p>詞的起源或許是與大衆的里巷歌曲有關的、但牠一登大雅之堂，便爲特殊的羣所獨有，因爲他們纔有醇酒婦人歌唱的享樂。有并水飤處，就有人歌柳詞，記得這是從宋朝一個敵國使臣所得的印象，或許是指都市而説的。如今柳詞具在，並不見得牠是大衆的東西。就算牠流傳到了大衆，也好像桃花江毛毛雨一類歌曲，流行到了黄包車夫，不過是聽慣了的緣故，然而這種歌曲的眞正享樂者，究竟是另一種特殊的羣。有一些文學史家以爲詞是平民文學，那是可笑極了！</p>
<p>現在要説到戲曲。</p>
<p>初民的舞蹈姿態，古代巫舞的情形，我們不甚清楚。從孔子所敬禮的鄉人儺，一直到現時代的迎神賽會，這種迷信的野蠻的宗教儀式，多少帶有戲劇的意味，在歷史上曾和戲劇的發展演進有過關聨的。秦漢的角抵，直到隋唐的百戲，除了供奉君主官僚的娛樂一個意義以外，同時含有誇耀權威的意味。就對外説，這可以威嚇四夷，漢武帝隋焬帝的所以舉行角抵百戲，招待歸順來朝的蠻夷使者商賈，就是這個意思。就對内説，這可以威嚇百姓，使小百姓看一看威武，同時娛樂一回，洩一洩不平之氣，這意味也是有的。何况這一類把戲原有嚇鬼驅疫，娛神祈年的意味，我們也可以意味到呢！總之，戲劇的所以起來，是有許我因子助成的，决不是僅僅爲了大衆的娛樂，這是我們應該知道的了。</p>
<p>唐宋的大曲，參軍，官本雜劇等等，大抵是教坊樂人的東西，供奉宮廷，這和大衆不相干。金元的院本，雜劇，當然是由這些東西發展演進而來。院本怎樣，很難考查了。顧名思義，牠旣是行院之本，妓院裏流行的東西，牠和大衆該有接近的機會罷。再就雜劇説，那是比後來的傳奇差不多完全變成特殊的羣一種把戲，似乎有點不同，至少牠的曲子説白，比較通俗得多，不曾有意注重詞藻駢儷。但據我們已經找得的記載而説，雜劇傳奇的演出，是由教坊家伶，有没有流行民間的戲班子，還是疑問。</p>
<p>皮黄繼傳奇而起，雖由特殊的羣提倡，却是和大衆有緣。不僅牠的曲子説白是用的比較接近大衆的語言文字，同時各地通都大邑，乃至鄉村市鎭，也都有這種戲班子的踪跡，所以我們要説京戲是雅俗共賞的一種藝術了。</p>

<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>但是在他的眼裏，什麽都是美好的，每一物件都有一段光輝的過去。除開了那些他自己用過或是爲他的家所有的之外，那些由别人賣到他這裏來的，（這可也是五年前的事了，五年裏他没有富裕的錢來收買别人的舊物，）也都有牠自已本身的故事，出賣者抹着眼涙説給他聽。那時他也許陪出些眼涙，把錢塞到賣者的手中，聽着他的道謝走出去，把這破舊的什物剩在這裏。轉過頭來他就覺得上了當，生着氣，把他唯一的助手駡一頓，（這個助手，就是他的孫子，名子是亞歷山大，平時爲人呌着縮名沙夏，一個二十幾歲的年青小夥子。　着）</p>
<p>他搬到一邊去。可是他却把那美麗的故事清清楚楚地印在腦中，如果有顧客來看中了他就能把這故事説得更動人一點，爲的是能得着好價格。</p>
<p>（你可不要看見它破就縐起眉頭，它可是咱們俄國造的上等貨。――可不是現時的俄國，那羣反叛的國家。這個手風琴就是一千八百五十一年，也許是五十二年，轟動了整個的彼得堡的歌唱家，呌什麽諾――，你可得原諒我，我記不起來了，，我是快要活到七十歲了。――就是他用過的。你可得知道這個諾――是又年青又漂亮，多少女人着了他的迷，他可就是性情不好，不歡喜那些娘兒們。我就知道有些不得和他親近的女人，買通了他的僕役，在他的手風琴上偷偷地吻一下。你不信聞聞看，到現在還有脂粉香呢！他愛上的是一個頂不愛他的女人，世界上的事都是這麽怪的，他一輩子可没有得着她的青睞，他就帶了他的琴，跳河死了――）</p>
<p>他自己在心中温着這只破舊的手風琴的故事，有一點疑難上來，即是把它的主人説成自殺死了的，是不是爲那買主們覺着一點可怕呢？</p>
<p>但是這件故事却使他自己十分滿意，甚至於連他自己也騙了過去，就喫力地把鼻子凑到那手風琴的近前，聞聞是不是留有脂粉的香氣。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>但是，我雖然一個人在暗暗的担憂，其餘的那些女官，宮女太監，却一些没有什麽感想；他們只知道眼前起了一件小小　變故，便是太后所心愛的那些古玩玉器，已翻下來了，他們好像尋常的人遇見了　類事件一樣，來不及的紛紛槍上前來，把已經吊下去的趕快拾起來，把没有吊下去而快要吊下去的，趕快用手扶住，差不多每個人已使出了他的全部的力量。可是這樣一閙，便把一座列車上的小朝廷閙得秩序大亂，不成體統了。在宮中，或在頤和園裏，可説是幾百年來，從不曾有過這樣大大失態的情形的！我想要如給先前拚命上秦章，反對太后冒險乘坐火車往奉天去的那些朝臣們見到了這種情形，他們一定會摇着頭，頓足長嘆道：（我們可諫勸得是嗎？現在你看：這不是一種不祥的預兆嗎）？</p>
<p>我因爲一來已經承認這件事情已是閙得不可收拾了，二來也許可以説我簡直是嚇昏了，所以我祗是袖手旁觀的候着，希望太后自己或者會想出什麽好的方法來，補救這個缺陷；但是伊也不作一聲。我忍不住旋過頭去看了伊一眼，－－心理是懷着十二分的恐懼－－不料伊却是在那裏輾然微笑，在這種時候，伊居然還能不着惱而反給我們以温和的微笑，眞是百年希逢之事！我心上的一塊大石頭，這才落下去了。可是我已經嚇得快要跌下去了，我的腿不由自主的索索地抖着，手冷得像冬天一樣。我想其餘的人，要如都像我這樣的嚇得呆立一傍，睜大了眸子儘看着那些東西自己吊下去，以致於打碎，我們便無論如可，難免要受一塲可怕的磨折了。虧得他們忘掉了朝廷的尊嚴，做出了這種手忙脚亂的態度，才使太后轉怒爲笑，把一天大事，化爲烏有，眞是不幸中之大幸！（一○四）</p>

<p>狡兎有三窟，）考大學也是一般，單考一校，希望是很少的。凡是應入學試騐的先生們，至少須考三處大學，小子也是未能免俗，考清華，考交大，考浙大，應了一句（三考裏出身。）考清華時，形容化子面貌苦了我，考交大時，誤造陜西房子苦了我，考浙大時，渾身腰脊疼痛苦了我。</p>
<p>考清華時，科學題目，不見得十分困難，惟有英文題目，眞個吃弗消了，同時應考的都是堅起了鋼筆梗，呆呆地出神，小子也是呆呆地出神者之一。題目的大意，呌做：（倘有一個化子向你乞錢，在你未付錢時，化子的面貌怎麽樣？旣付錢後，化子的面貌怎麽樣？試描摩化子的兩番面貌，限作一百五十字。）天哪！一百五十字描摩化子的面貌，怎樣描摩呢？恨不得拉一位癟三先生到面前來，把他實地試騐一下子！</p>
<p>考交大時，國學常識中，有一條文言譯語體的題目，呌做：（秦無廬，非無廬也，夫人而能爲廬也。）驟見之下，譯這幾句，費甚麽吹灰之力？便卽　落筆道（陜西没有房子，不是没有房子，每一個人都會建築房子。）我以爲大槪是不錯的了。出塲以後，講給老假聽，老師笑道：（你弄錯了，原文出於周禮冬官考工記，害個廬字，不作房子講，是説矛戟的柄。）我聽説，先是悵然，後來啞然，這一天誤造陜西房子的，不止小子一人，大槪百人裏面，倒有九十九個纏夾二先生。</p>

<p>— 海角囚徒</p>
<p>外國人到中國來，向來如入無人之境，我們的海關上是青眼相看的。中國人呢，不僅是僑居在國外的，例如殖民地内，不絶的飽受種種鹹酸苦辣的待遇，近來却連走出國門一步都要賦著（蜀道難）了。</p>
<p>（南洋），數百年來一向是我們閩粤兩省同胞的外府。安南，暹羅，缅甸，英屬馬來亞，美屬菲列賓，荷屬東印度……這些地方？我國的僑民少則數萬，多則數百萬，數量上比統治國的白種居民都要遠遠的超過。這些地方的開闢繁盛，一大半都曾經流著華僑的血汗。然而現在，各殖民地政府爲限制華人起見，只放你歸來，不讓你進門，已成了（來得去不得）的局面了。</p>
<p>最近，有一位朋友應著星加坡一個僑校的招請，因爲急於趕往開學，匆匆就道，領了護照隨同繳了十元的入口税，經英國駐滬領事簽了字，便去買船票。星加坡！走出我們的南門纔只幾步路！可是非得乘外國船不可。每條船，只限乘十五個到南洋去的華人，船票早已先期售完。船上空艙位雖然很多，却寗可裝運空氣。那位朋友迫不及待，聽到人家説到香港候船，比較船舶來得多。便先買船到香港。不料到港一問，港上候船去南洋的人比上海要多上數十倍。有的住在旅館裏等了半個月以上的。船票的價錢經手的旅館們它抬得像利市三倍的股票一樣。直等了十幾天，經了許多轉折，纔攢得了一張高價的三等船票向著熱烘烘的赤道進發。還不知前途是否一帆風順呢。現在到荷屬東印去的新客要繳國幣三百元以上的進口税，到菲列賓去的要一千元以上的菲幣（？）貧苦的中國人，要走出國門去找個麵包吃都没份子了啊！</p>

<p>— 馬嬰</p>
<p>我們隔壁人家有個老婦人，今年已經六十多歲了。伊娘家的姓氏，恐怕除了伊自已就没人知道的了，因爲伊婆家姓王，所以大家都稱呼伊做王老太。</p>
<p>王老太的歷史，我們雖然不大熟悉；但聽見一般父老們談：伊在嫁過來的三年後，就死去丈夫，伊乃立誓守節。那時伊還只二十歲呢，像這樣年青的少婦，竟有這樣重的節操觀念，這確是很難得的。</p>
<p>伊忍飢受寒，孤獨地操作，孤獨地休息，只有影兒是伊伴侣。</p>
<p>據説在新寡的第一年，除了至親幾個長輩以外，伊没有和一個陌生男人談過一句話。</p>
<p>在那時的鄉村里，舊禮教的勢力特别濃厚，王老太那種自甘孤苦生活，替丈夫守節的舉動，早已受了一般成正派人們的尊敬；但另一方面，所謂鄉村里的小遊民和閒漢，却又狂蜂浪蝶似的，集全力向伊進攻了。</p>
<p>到了第二年的春天，花兒萌茅，草兒芬芳，紫燕兒對語，蛺蝶兒雙舞，那麽輕鬆，那麽醉人的春之氣息心入了每個年青男女們的心里，都好像着了迷。這時候的王老太！那時伊只二十一歲，幸勿因老字而誤會！的舉動忽然改變了。在一個三月的夜晚，發生了一件出乎意外的事，那便是王老太在一個男子的威脅之下，間不容髮之際，伊忽然心上一冷，猛然將那男子推開，逃出門外，最後是投了河；幸而被人救起没有送命。</p>
<p>以後，伊看見男子就遠遠地避開。一直到現在，還是這樣。不過伊現在老了，有時坐在門前，仰望天空，在伊臉上的皺紋里似乎隠藏着寂寞的悲哀。</p>

<p>由於人類的愛美心很重，往往面上長着一個小疤會喪失了終生的愉快，或是引爲畢身憾事。但是我們聰明的女士們會利用美麗的頭髮掩去了面部的缺陷，同時就如爲着瞎了一隻眼睛反而戴上一副墨黑的眼鏡，以致視物更加不便的也大有人在。</p>
<p>裝俏作嬌，固是女士們最有效的御夫之術，可是也得看什麽時機，有時會因厭起來吃着兩個耳刮子。</p>
<p>你要攀上一個大名鼎鼎的舞女，你將會看見伊許多白眼，同時這舞女的一切未必怎麽好。假如你要攀上一個生意清淡的舞女，你非但可以節省化用，並可多得實惠，同一化錢，大有講究，不可不劃算劉算。</p>

<h3 id="c263">從外國説到中國 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 江明</p>
<p>在我還在小學念書的時候，有一位從美國回來的華僑告訴我説，（在外國是没有乞丐的，因爲政府要禁止。）於是我的心裏就幻想着這個（外國）是怎樣的一個（天國），甚至想到那（天國）裏去享一點生活。後來又有一位從呂宋回來的華僑告訴我，（在外國的乞丐是被禁止的，不過他們可以換一個方法去行乞，他們大多是手裏揑着一大把鉛筆，向行人討錢，你給他幾個銅板，他就給你一枝鉛筆，這也算作表示謝意。）於是我明白了，所謂（外國是没有乞丐的）原來是這樣的一套把戲！</p>
<p>在上海的租界，乞丐是一樣的懸爲禁例的。囚車在街跑着，遇到了乞丐就拿起來，這是司空見慣的事情。可是拿不勝拿，他們一出了工部局的大門，又只可再去行乞，於是前些時候，用運貨汽車把乞丐載到閘北一帶驅散，不準再回租界。天然租界是有特殊勢力的所在，我們也就没有什麽話可説。</p>
<p>然而，現在，（津社會局大捕乞丐）（九日申報）但是也有捕不勝捕之勢，（兩日内僅）一分局界内，捕得四百餘名，其流浪租界以乞爲職業者，尚有二萬餘名。）看了這樣偌大的一個數目就會使你心寒，如果（津社會局）把他們完全（捕）到了，救濟院是一定容無可容的，那麽又把他們怎樣辦呢？</p>
<p>值得注意的是（以乞丐爲職業），這眞所謂亦莊亦諧，乞丐也會成爲了一種職業了，説來眞會使人發噱，然而，這是一個嚴重的問題，這有其社會的原因存在的：在農村經濟破産，都市失業恐慌相交熬迫的時候，乞丐就成爲了一種職業。如果我們把全國的乞丐統計起來，數目一定很驚人，恐怕要在全國人口五分之一以。要使這末多的乞丐不再在社會中存在，只是把社會從根本改造過來，决無其他妥善辦法，像租界當局那樣（捉拿）（驅逐）是决不能見效的。</p>

<p>— 潔蓀</p>
<p>成叔的宴會過了之後，行李都搬齊了，殷姊才蹣跚地進來。今天是禮佛節地空閒着。屋中黑壓壓地濟滿了送行的；有的是送殷姊的，有的是送我的。搬行李的車夫的嘈雜和呌聲，和一般送别應説的話，凑成很刺耳的聲浪。華雖也，正不减少於我呢！她那微凝的屋眸，蓬蓬的鬢絲，已堪供我日後的深深的回憶了！</p>
<p>夕陽的紅暉映在漆紅的粉牆上，我和嬸母們含涙作别；和哥哥及親友們登汽車，飛也似的向那吵雜的碼頭駛去，繁亂的離情别緒，使我感到侷促不安！</p>
<p>碼頭上堆滿了一羣旅人，有的是衣錦還鄉，有的是窮途流落，有的是送君千里，有的是遠離雙親。這種形形式式的征人，悲喜不一的情緒，當然是悲喜不一。小艇枕航織梭般的在綠波上送客來往。我終於離開了送行的親友們，坐着小艇走了！翩翩的裙子，飛揚的手巾，漸漸在眼底迷糊了！眼前綠閃閃的柔波一片！</p>
<p>小艇漸漸駕近大船，黑雲也似的濃烟，急促地從船烟囱噴出；我們扶着高高的梯子，巍巍步上，行李搬進一間頗精緻的艙房，呵，這將伴我十多天的航程！</p>
<p>哥哥吩咐殷姊許多話，殷姊的父親也吩咐她許多話，大槪是教她照料我的意思。這時，和他們握手道别，心中的亂緒，是不能以筆墨形容的！嗚嗚的汽笛，催着他們回去。</p>
<p>呆呆倚着鐵欄，滿眶熱涙幾乎滾下來！然而，終於竭力忍着！因爲在衆目彰彰之下，我不願意現出我這樣的弱點。哥哥和小艇的遠影，慢慢盪向岸上去，我滿眶的熱涙呵，忍着，忍着！……</p>
<p>汽笛長嘯一聲，兩岸的青山，碧樹，樓厦，房舍，都向後退去。船身頓然開動了。芒目的紅光，照着樓厦，樹木都變成紅色。驕傲地好像對我説：（你這孩子，去罷！（蠻貊的異邦，）再不要留戀了！</p>
<p>我萬般的悵恨！我寳貴的童年就在這（蠻貊的異邦）的懷抱中消逝！</p>
<p>如今，如今我要歸去，歸去，懷着滿腔的熱望向着我的祖國歸去！！！</p>
<p>富有詩意的椰風蕉雨，和那，和那落日反照，波光激灧的湄南河，從此，從此只能在夢中回味你們了！</p>

<p>— 懷瀛</p>
<p>他的名字呌楊大可，但同學們都呌他（小辮子）。</p>
<p>在他的左後腦上，梳着一條長髮辮，這就是同學們給他起這個綽號的原因吧？</p>
<p>是的，像他這樣一個十二歲的男孩子，實在没有理由留着一條辮子，問到他，他説是媽媽的主意。</p>
<p>（你不好自己剃了麽？）</p>
<p>如果是别人問他這句話，他會認爲又是要戲他的，可是問這話的是我，是他的先生，他就不得不鄭重其事地回答我，他説：</p>
<p>（媽媽不讓剃，媽説這是還什麽愿，我也不願留呀。）</p>
<p>不錯，從别人一呌到他的綽號，他就紅臉，似乎有點怪難爲情的，我就知道他也是討厭這條辮子的，可是我因爲猜不出是什麽道理，所以這樣問。那麽，他是受到媽媽的限制了，不，是受着舊社會制度下迷信心理的影響了。</p>
<p>孩子倒不缺乏聰明，樣樣功課都答得出，作得出，而且還寫一手好字，説句老實話，他的字，我這作先生的眞都有些比不上。遊戲，踢皮球，他也樣樣能，只不過一當别人抓住他的辮子時，他就像作了錯事的孩子，讓大人發現到了似的，一聲不響着就往人少的地方躱去了。</p>
<p>他時常遲到，其實可以説天天遲到，遲到的鐘點，總是半點鐘，他來時，悄悄開開教室的門，向我行一個禮，就走到他的坐位。别的學生們，這時就把視線從書本上移到他的身上。</p>
<p>爲這事，我非常不痛快，曾經嚴厲的責罰過他，罰他站立，罰他背書，罰他擦玻璃，還罰他掃地，我是作先生的，總不能不立個規矩給别個學生看看的，也就是以一儆百的意思。他才怪呢，無論我怎樣責罰，都默默接受着，不哭，不喊。也不反抗，可是，如果問他是什麽原因，他却至死也不説，好像有什麽爲難的地方在着。有一次，我重重地打了他一頓手板子，兩雙手都紅腫起來了，因爲他旣然説不出遲到原由，又偏是天天遲到！他的右手和左手一樣腫了起來，所以下一課寫字堂拿筆管就不大容易了。</p>
<p>（你是一個殘暴的先生啊！）</p>
<p>我看他那情形，非常後悔，如果不是在一羣學生面前，眞要跑到他的身前，拉過的兩手，重重地吻上幾口，以贖贖我的罪惡。</p>
<p>他不但常遲到。手上，衣服上還常常染着一層鐵銹，我覺得這是與他遲到有關係的，就想法探究一下，然而，還是自想，問他家裏是作什麽生活的，都有什麽人，他也同樣不回答我，我的探究得不到結果。</p>
<p>有一個禮拜天，我用的一只洋鐵壺不知怎的漏了一個洞，若是不修補簡直就變成了廢物，我决計去找洋鐵壺舖鑲補鑲補。</p>
<p>我們這學校是没有聽差的，就以我這作教員的來説，如果想喝開水，都要自己去泡，自然鑲壺也只有自己出馬了，哼，想不到，我找到的洋鐵舖正是小辮子媽媽開設的。他正在嗙嗙嗙地用木棒打着鐵片，看着我，紅了紅臉，然後把壺接過去了，並告訴他的媽媽我是什麽人。</p>
<p>他的媽媽除了要請我在她的孩子身上多多分心教導外，並請我原諒他每天晚到半點鐘，因爲那半點鐘是他的工作</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>時間，我這才知道了小辮子每天遲到的原因。他家的苦况，我也從他母親口中聽到了好些。這愈使我覺得過去責罰他的罪過。</p>
<p>（小辮子，你是個好孩子，你是個苦孩子，是我錯責了你。）回校時，我這麽重覆着。一面呆呆地注視着修好的洋鐵壺。</p>

<p>— 王慈</p>
<p>（青光白光，</p>
<p>晒殺老蚌。）</p>
<p>三林兒站着草塲上，時候是在太陽剛下山的當兒，東面的天空發射着太陽旗似的光輝－－這是農人們認爲是象徴明兒旱熱的－－在三林兒意識里，以爲是天公公呌他唱歌謡的標識，歪着臉，呶起嘴兒，滿有勁兒地：</p>
<p>（青光呀！</p>
<p>白光呀！</p>
<p>明兒蘆浜里晒殺一隻大老蚌！）</p>
<p>唱唱，快活變了笑容襲上了臉，把身旁的一對大花雞趕着要。</p>
<p>大花雞被三林兒趕得轉了灣，撲到水橋跟邊，三林兒顫顫巍巍地追上去，把大花雞追得没路可走的當兒：</p>
<p>拍！拍！拍！拍！</p>
<p>一對大花雞，已撲到小河那里去了。</p>
<p>小河里已不像一條河，没有半點水，枯黄的水藻堆里間，或有三四條死魚反白了肚子楞着；祗有最低的地方一條不到二寸寛的小壕子里的泥兒還有些軟潤。</p>
<p>一對大花雞在河底里跳着走，偶而找到滿濕潤的一二個較深寛的壕子里啄濾些水喝，可是一下就跳走啦。</p>
<p>三林兒居住在水橋邊，不再去追趕，凝望着乾枯的河底裏，哇地哭啦：</p>
<p>（媽呀！媽呀！三林兒要吃晚飯啦！三林兒肚子餓得眞難過啦！）</p>
<p>不曉得那個被三林兒稱做媽的人兒在那裏，三林兒那末哭，那末喊；始終没有半個影子。</p>
<p>一條乾涸得可憐的小河依然仍在三林兒的面前。</p>
<p>三林兒知道，媽是在大日光里，就出去了，到離開現在三林兒站着的地方有半里多遠的地方去踏車去了；昨天媽回來的時候，天已是將近昏黑了，三林兒也站在這兒，在哭，看見媽來，把整個兒的身體撲上去，媽把他抱起來，親親頰兒：</p>
<p>（三林兒，好寳寳，幹嗎站在這兒哭啦？）</p>
<p>（三林兒肚子餓啦。）</p>
<p>（唉唉，寳寳呵！！）</p>
<p>媽把嘴唇呶向那條小河；</p>
<p>（河里的水越淺，媽回來的時候越晚；明兒再不下兩，媽回來還要晚些呢！寳寳，好寳寳，耐性兒些吧！）</p>
<p>三林兒聽得很清楚，看看媽的眼睛裏湧滿着眼涙，不好過起來，哇哇地又哭啦。</p>
<p>（三林兒，好寳寳－－）媽眞的抽咽起來了：（河里的水永遠乾着，媽永遠没飯給你吃…）</p>
<p>乾涸的小河觸動了三林兒昨天的印象：（河里的水永遠乾着，媽永遠没飯給你吃！）今天小河不是乾了嗎？三林兒没飯吃啦，三林兒肚子餓啦。</p>

<h3 id="c267">談賣稿 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 雋</p>
<p>賣稿與寫文章粗看是一而二、二而一，似乎分不出什麽差别來。其實不然，兩者是迴異其趣的賣稿一事，寫文章又一事。寫文章的大抵不是將文章視爲一種專門化的職業，換句話説，卽是不以筆墨爲生，而是附業的地，餘技的地，偶然興緻所至，信筆成文，目的不一定在於稿費之收入，而往往是籍作抒洩一時心中的苦悶，或是寄幽思於文字，或是把性靈於舊章。其間動機雖有不同，但用之以爲遣情娛目則一也，這對於本人至少，存有一種忘我的境界，陶醉的境界。高興則爲寫，不高興則罷，文章和生活是各自分開的，所以文章之於他們多少是具有一種精神的蘇息的愉快。説到賣稿呢，就截然不是如此了。所謂賣稿，明顯地説，便是專靠筆耕過活，把文章達到了專門職業化的田地。把稿子和生活聨成二位一體的密切的關係了。</p>
<p>世間無論那一宗事件，如果是一生到老老是不能分離，甚且不願意幹而仍不得不勉强幹下去，那不管是怎樣，有濃厚興味的事，也必於隨着時間的推移漸漸消失了那原有的興味，而習久生厭起來。文章一道，何獨不然？而且比任何事都容易感到厭倦，乏味。到了這種時候，文章所特有的興趣是消失了。這也祇有况浸此中的人，始能眞切地　略到那滋味。一到了專靠賣稿糊口，已經不能再抱着什麽抒發，心盡的間適的態度有筆，而是無往不含着。種種生活鬥爭的意味在其中，稿子等於生活，一切的質物資料，點滴都是要從一支筆尖上産生出來。生活如一個青面獠牙的惡魔，如一根鋭利的皮鞭，在緊緊抽抽打着你，進逼着你，爲生活，於是不由不寫，而且不憑你不寫，不寫也得咬着牙根冩下去。</p>
<p>固實現的要求和壓迫，於是只得寫因爲窮，於是拚命嗎，但有時越窮越寫不出，可是還得拚命，於是便只好拚命濫造粗造，爲了生活，不得不如此，筆一停就會餓死的。</p>
<p>然而個人的精神積蓄是非常有限的，不是象山泉的永遠流個不盡，卽是鑛山也終有發掘凈盡之一日。何况是人？因此爲稿費報酬的多寡起見，又得在這上面打算盤，而往往爲求各得點收獲計，於是把稿子盡量拉長，盡量的增加一些浪費的篇幅。</p>
<p>到了這樣，已不是在寫文章，而是變成一個工匠了，説去説回來，如今這年頭，稿子論字給值，文章的不值錢怕至此無以復加的了。作家們不幸而欲使筆桿温腹，實在也是再悲慘不過的事。况且文思有枯竭之虞，而生活的供應無止，人又不是鐵打的，更非如機械之可以加了油就可繼續轉動，一旦江淹才盡但是稿子仍不能不寫，這一來，就只得搜索枯腸，硬生生的榨出來一樣了。故其於稿子字句之間斤斤計較者，雖非上乘，蓋亦令不勝感嘆者矣。</p>
<h3 id="c268">情帑 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 清</p>
<p>預料中可能發生的事果眞一點不錯地擺在眼底：她好幾天没來，不就是證明事體本身已經有了極快的變化。自己早便猜準了的，她必然又在跟别個男人進行出賣唯一的財産－－肉體了。這一月個的中間，她差不多天天來和我糾纏在一塊，每晚當舞塲散了的微明的清早，她老是悄悄地推開房門進來。撳亮電燈，把我從酣睡的夢裏吵醒過來。</p>
<p>瞧着她坐在牀沿上，放蕩地望我笑了一笑。接着竟索性的將上半身倒在被窩上邊，再嘻嘻地笑着，這時候我眞有些覺得憤怒，不應該這樣荒唐來攪擾我甜密的睏覺，但一方面又被一種誘惑的魔念所支配着。郎亮的燈光射在她臉上，胭粉已經異樣地狼藉了。但在那惺忪的倦態裏却襯出更異樣的動人的風騷來。</p>
<p>她走後，便想起這麽一個商吕式蟑魚似的女人，每天在過着夜開花的生活，每晚每晚在那暗綠色的塲裏邊，在那爵士樂的旋律上面，打得你花一樣的妖媚，讓許多陌生的男子摟在懷裏，任人家調笑着，戲謔着。</p>
<p>愛是鍍了金的，用金圈去買得時間性的歡情。</p>
<p>會在那麽的地方認識了她，一個商品的都會女人！</p>
<p>她會輕輕便便地跟自己打得一片熱，自然也會同樣容易的就愛上了别個的。我是十分清晰地。决不至痴情的要求久的佔有她。况且每次臨走的時候，幾乎没一次會忘記了錢的一回事，這已經使我一想全身冷了半截了。</p>
<p>祇可憐這般女人不曾認清了自己看輕貞操如看輕紙片一樣，隨便將肉體供獻給男子踴躏。只消能够滿足她的物質慾。用自己的青春來過着豪奢的無恥的生活，放浪的生活，可是作爲妝飾生命的青春的時期究竟是短促有限的，等到過了落花時節的那時，後悔已來不及了吧？</p>
<p>如今她的行爲正是這一類都會墮落性的女人。儘在加速度的摧殘自己的生命。把自己一步步的送上墳墓的邊沿。這一月來的胡纏，着實使我對於一切的女人都感到極大的憎惡。不止是她，現在地來了，眞是像卸了一身債一般的輕鬆。</p>

<p>— 穆因</p>
<p>當一個正在成熟期中的少女，她遇見了一個陌生人，特别是對於青年男子，她便會不自覺地雙頰羞紅起來，也不必一定是要遇到青年男子，卽令同她的同學閨友在一處，只要在你的談吐中暗示出一點關係到男子或關係到女子的性的意識之時，僅一點點的暗示，或能引起聨想的談話就够了，她便會杏腮暈紅，粉頸低垂，表示出一種女兒的羞澀的態度來，這種態度就呌做女兒羞－（ＧIRL·SHY）</p>
<p>在我的經騐中，遇到這種事可謂很不少了，往往我回到家裏，遇見鄰家的少女們在我家裏正同穆家人們説話，一見我來，不是臉兒紅紅，眼兒下視的背着我，便是翩若驚鴻似地一瞥就跑回去了。本來她們正談得非常出神的、我一到，她們便自己中斷了，這是一種甚麽心理呢？她們還是怕懼我呢？她們還是厭惡我呢？這是表示一種甚麽意思？</p>
<p>我猜想：一個少女對青年男子會發覺到愛好嗎？見了青年男子會聨帶引起她的性意識嗎？或者她生恐她心中不可告人的秘密會被人發覺了？……</p>
<p>起初我不但覺到奇怪，而且有些失望。一個美麗的綽約如仙子的少女，又是正當含苞欲放的時候，正具有一種縈人夢想的姿態，而常常在你的眼前一瞥卽消失了，這是如何一種使人惘然的事！</p>
<p>但立刻我就覺出這是處女特有的美了。－－這種怯生生地的美，在不懂事女孩身上不能找到，在旣懂事的婦人身上也不能找到，除非是一個妖冶的蕩婦，她會故意的做出種種淫蕩的婆態來媚人、故意的裝出欲迎還拒佯羞的嬌嗔的態度來誘人、然此又是蕩婦特有的美點，不能與少女的羞怯並論。</p>
<p>我們不要忘了，一個正在成熟期中的少女，她正由兒童的無憂的樂國，踏入到成人的罪惡的世界之時，一切在兒童時代認爲神秘的事情，到此時都巳有了一部份的相當的解釋，尤共是關於男女相生相悦的道理，差不多佔據了她們整個的稚嫩的心，這是一種不可告人的秘密，至少在她們以爲如此，被她們發見了，於是她們的心充滿了驚喜，欣慰，懷疑，恐懼，憂慮……種種複雜的感情。她們徬徨着，然而又想嘗試。她們對于青年男子覺到愛好，然而又覺到恐懼。在這種矛盾的心理之下，她們常常坐立不安。她們的神經異常鋭敏，常會由一些不相關的事或一句不相關的話而意識到她們所想像的不可告人的東西和意識到她們所想像的不可告人的東西和事情。正當充滿了青春的血液的少女，她們自然會因這些想像而使她的粉頰飛霞，媚眼佯羞——不知覺地表出她們處女的特有的美點來。</p>
<p>我們不要以爲處女的含羞是不爽快，是不赤裸；須知一個處女的美點，正完全是她羞澀的心理所形成的呢。若有一個詩人，他能把含羞的少女做題材，詠成詩歌，我以爲那一定是一首好詩，足以令人迴環諷誦，像愛悦情人般的珍重它呢。</p>

<p>兩星期後，我因事到了三十里路外秀發村的姑丈家。姑丈的大門簇擁着密密的人叢，脚踏着脚，頭擠着頭，每一隻眼睛都注視着裏邊的中堂，像在看入神的幻術。中堂響着高聲的吆喝，滲雜着凄凄切切的慘呌，使我想起閻羅殿的牛頭夜义酷打三世惡人的神話。</p>
<p>我好奇地拚命擠上大門的石級，擠過同樣塞滿了人衆的寛大的天井，擠到中堂的跟前，忽然頭一陣昏，心一陣酸，眼一陣花，彷彿眞的進了閻羅殿了。</p>
<p>中堂右邊横樑上，懸掛着一個骨骼粗大肌肉消瘦的半裸體，手反縛着，兩脚在空中拚命地彈動。一個惡魏似的漢子向這半死半活的裸體用勁地抽看紅柴刺，無數小小的窟窿湧出殷紅的鮮血，織成一片糢糊的血網，我定神一看這幕悲劇的主角的嘴臉，原來就是那個被逐出境的呆子長工。</p>

<p>這是安娜日後成敗的一個緊要關頭。她那時候决不會想到她會成功一個世界聞名的大明星，就是美國的邀請她更是夢想不到的。</p>
<p>佛蘭克知道如果她在那影片裏没有位置，她就要被他們遣送回國的：無疑的她昨從此失敗了。但是他决不願意她得到這樣的結果，她一定要設法挽救。最後他向公司裏担承安娜攝片時的薪俸由他付給，公司裏方才答應讓她在片子裏做女主角。</p>

<p>她的努力改變了她的命運，她的成功有没有改變她的人呢？没有，可説完全没有，她還是那個樣子；并且她的成功反而使她害怕起來，她會見了一個稍爲重要一點的人物，她一定要問佛蘭克：（我説錯了話没有？我的舉動對嗎？）</p>
<p>佛蘭克在德國蓋了兩座屋了。本來他自己祗需要一座就够了，但是德國政府要地主多蓋房屋的緣故，對於空地的税特别的重，所以他就蓋了兩座，將一座租給安娜。他們現在變成了鄰居，佛蘭克的妻子早死了，安娜時常過來探望他和他的小女孩兒的。</p>
<p>一天，安娜修飾得格外美麗，跑進他的屋子就嚷着説道：（我要搬家了！）那時候佛蘭克聽到她的話，心房都停止搏動，雙手緊握着她的手，好像怕她要逃走似的，抖着聲音問道：（你要搬到那裏去呢？）她説：（我搬到你屋子裏來，伺你住在一起；我付房租付得厭煩了，并且我也歡喜這所屋子呵！）在一九三○年的秋天他們便結婚了。</p>
<p>他們的婚禮對於他們的愛情，並没有增加，也没有减少。後來桑高文（Goldwyn）把安娜帶到美國去，佛蘭克也就辭去了他的職務，跟着她一同到了美國。他們倆老是守在一塊兒，從來没有離開過，佛蘭克説過，影片是他的生命，安娜的成功是他的唯一的願望了。</p>
<p>這是佛蘭克他以前從來没有告訴過人家一個安娜史丹的故事。（完）</p>

<p>— 胡越</p>
<p>His　Man　is　Mine大上海映</p>
<p>（伉儷鏡）是一部描寫三角戀愛的影片。</p>
<p>一對結合了已有五年的夫妻，因了男人的舊愛而回到了本地，於是這三個角色，便起了一個小小的愛的波折。終於男人的舊愛和别人結了婚，於是這一對夫妻便又和好如初。</p>
<p>這裏有千篇一律的Happyending，有陳舊的，爛熟的羅曼史，有平凡的庸俗的手法。</p>
<p>（伉儷鏡）並不能給予我們以比較新鮮的東西，只是像普通的膚淺的戀愛片一樣，寫的依舊是少爺小姐們的閙不清的三角多角的戀愛把戲。</p>
<p>（伉儷鏡）和恩怨夫妻有相似的地方，同是叙述着布爾喬亞的在現社會裏的瑣屑的起居注的。</p>
<p>在這裏，幽默的輕倩的對話，逗引了紳士淑女們的笑，明快的手法，給予了紳士淑女們以娛樂的滿足，在這一點，劇作者是盡了他的職責的。</p>
<p>但是，在那笑聲裏，在滿足中，掩住了多麽醜惡的現實，粉飾了多麽慘酷的圖畫。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c274">（女人）我評 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>（女人），無疑的，我承認是國産片中一部成功的作品。先就劇本説，當然是有意識的，描寫三個不同個性的女性在生命途中，所遭受的一切，在中國的現社會中，女人眞難找出路。但女人却不能因爲難找出路而出賣靈魂，更不能以爲結婚是一定可以解决出路問題的。</p>
<p>（女人）已明白的告訴我們了，女人大多數是養了孩子以後，把愛丈夫的心去愛孩子；男人也就在這時候對女人的情感是冷淡了，另外去愛人，這是多麽錯誤呀！</p>
<p>（女人）中也明白的指示我們（九一八）東北四省失陷，失地至今没有收復，但失掉了靈魂的青年們，和小亭一樣，早已把這空前的國恥，忘記得乾凈，日夜沉浸在舞塲之中。</p>
<p>（女人）在警惕青年們不要醉生夢死。</p>
<p>（女人）不但把社會問題當做中心，而且還含有教育的意義，指導社會上那些在呐喊着的青年男女，不要再走上歧途吧？</p>
<p>導演也能把鏡頭活用，雖然有好多的穿揷，而使觀衆不覺討厭。女生宿舍裏的爭執，鄉下人看見公子哥兒帶了上海小姐回來少見多怪爭相看望，（九一八）後上海都市中所見的是大减價的旗子，滿街颶蕩，大工廠，大商號，常在倒閉，這些外界，都可爲中國都市鄉村的現實情形寫照。演員中黎明暉不拘在浪漫的時期，在悲痛的時期，演得都不差，不過她在被小亭遺棄，小芬焚斃，最苦痛的時候，她始終没有流過一滴眞涙，也許她是不善哭的吧？胡萍的金玲，王引的小亭，演得都不差。</p>
<p>小亭是這樣的一個儇薄少年，而最後不過撫屍大痛，徒呼奈何，關於這一點似乎還不够使觀衆大快人心吧？我以爲。</p>

<p>— 湧森</p>
<p>（女人）裏面，没有解决婦女問題，也没有指示一條女人的出路。</p>
<p>不過，有一個很好的啟示給予觀衆，乃是説：（女人）嫁了丈夫之後，應該做個（賢妻良母），並且不應（倚賴丈夫），他叙出梁玉芬嫁後的生活，－晏起，賭牌，以及最後的遭遇，－經濟窘迫被丈夫遺棄，燒死女兒……來驚醒現社會裏這一輩女人，比諸正寫，來得有力，這是劇作者的聰明處。</p>
<p>（女人）已經得着許多好評，不過我以爲有幾節，是該商榷的，並不是吹毛求疵。</p>
<p>第一，王意芳的讀書，當然是不願幹（出賣靈魂）的勾當，要想自拔而圖上進。不料被學校開除；爲的是（曾充舞女有碍校風）這一點也許劇作者爲南京歌女王玉容鳴不平而揷入；那末，便不該描寫她在學校裏，專事塗脂搽粉，以及上課遲到等，顯然習性未改。</p>
<p>第二，梁玉芬等是否大學生，抑係中學生？不過，由化學程度來講，祇是中學生。如果是大學課程，未免太淺了一些！</p>
<p>第三，洪小亭在（牀頭金盡）的時候，何以不回去請母親接濟呢？他的母親在他没有失業以前，不是有三百塊錢的貼補嗎？</p>
<p>第四，梁玉芬窮窘時，寄信給許多同學謀事，其中應添一二個書面－梁玉芬託金玲找事做，或金玲予以帮助－因爲牠倆是接近一些，並且對於故事的進展，或者要順勢一些！我想。</p>
<p>此外，如佈景尚佳，攝影比（漁光曲）稍遜，字幕雖然警惕，但是並不簡潔，甚至一句有二十多字，並且還有錯字如一（終替你辦到）等。（下略）</p>

<p>— 草時</p>
<p>勞雷的手腕和一位偵探呌佛雷尼根的一同銬着。那時埃第正偎傍着凱興冲冲地走出來。惠爾許看見了埃第，就和他打招呼。勞雷亦站住了。他對埃第道：（朋友，你不要弄錯了他是你的朋友。他一路來挑撥你的是非呢，）埃第正要撲到惠爾許身上去，勞雷將他們隔開了。他説：（朋友，安分些，打打他不會便宜的。你旣是放出來了，還是直走吧。我是進去的，不怕什麽。）這就是他們友誼的開始。勞雷的拳頭，打在惠爾許的頭上，他倆雖然痛快一時，他却亦後患無竊。惠爾許不是是好打發的人，報仇的思想像似的在他的心裏燒着。他計劃要怎樣幹法。</p>
<p>當勞雷被釋脱離牢獄的時候，他的小小的眼睛射出奸詐的光芒，他可以連埃第同時着手。至於埃第五金來度着誠實歸正的生活，他的良心幼女，簡直没有在惠爾許的心上。有一天，監牢裏逃走了一個囚犯。他是前曾和勞雷同牢住過史東。惠爾許認爲他的機會來了。</p>
<p>佛雷尼根偵探把惠爾許的事報告了警長，警長是知道埃第與勞雷已歸正，他敬重他們－不信史東的逃亡，他們會有嫌疑。他冷冷的望着惠爾許説：（你追逐他們很够了－幾次破壞他們的職業，阻碍他們謀事－現在你不許再去和他們纒撓不清！一惠爾許祇在上司面前，是戰戰兢兢的。到了外面，他就放出了他偵探的本色來。</p>
<p>埃第與勞雷依然很安靜，專心工作。勞雷急切的要把謀到好差使的事告訴琪恩。他有些害怕。要是不把一切都告訴她，他决不能向她求婚。但因爲凱這樣忠心於埃第，他亦希望琪恩能够瞭解一切。蕭麗生日的前夜，勞雷與琪恩在埃第家裏用膳。凱望着他們，她知道他倆愛情已經到了什麽程度，並且因爲自己的婚姻是美滿的，她的心亦爲他們的羅曼斯而跳躍了。</p>
<p>他們去後，埃第照常的和蕭麗玩着。這種時候是使他最愉快的。在停息之後，蕭麗的大眼睛裏現出一種懷疑的神色。（爸，明天我的生日，你送我什麽東西？）他不肯告訴她，於是她猜踏水鞋，洋媛媛，但他祇是摇頭。（紟你接吻，可肯告訴我嗎？這聲音是更媚了。（好，可是？）而蕭麗已緊張地喊道；一哦，我知道了一定跳舞衣！）埃第不懂她怎會猜中的，問好怎樣會想到是跳舞衣的。蕭麗愉快的答復是：（因爲還是我最愛的。）跳舞衣是很貴的，但凱和埃第知道她穿了會像一朶玫瑰花般嬌麗。（好一年亦不不過祇有一次生日呀！）埃第這樣説。但他反而多買一只鏡筒，倘使不知道的人將它放在眼上一看，會留上一條黑痕在他的眼皮上的。凱嘆息着，但她亦笑了。（討厭的玩意！你要把蕭麗弄得和你一般頑皮了！）</p>
<p>那不是昨夜嗎？埃第現在站在餐室的門口，呆望着蕭麗與她的賓客們，好似昨夜已過去數千年了。他的眼睛流盼到凱，但又不敢和她對視，怕她發見了秘密，因爲她還没有知道呢。（未完）</p>

<p>(Beiping) Wang Kemin was summoned by Huang Fu some time ago to report on the situation in North China in Moganshan. When he passed through Nanjing and Shanghai, he paid separate visits to Wang and Kong to report on the financial situation in North China and to seek instructions on all matters. After completing his mission, he returned north. After meeting with Soong Tzu-wen in Qingdao, he arrived in Beiping this morning. According to his remarks, his trip south was to visit Huang and report on the situation in North China. The rumor that he was seeking loans in Shanghai is completely unfounded. The current financial situation in North China can be maintained, and there is no need to seek loans. Huang's trip to Kuling to meet with Lin, Chiang, Wang, and others was a meeting that should have taken place before his return north and was not a so-called conference. If Huang has no other important matters, he should be able to return north within this week. Yin Tong may come north first. (13th Special Dispatch) Retired Japanese Military Officers</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held its 134th Memorial Week this morning. Approximately 500 people attended, including Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Shao Yuanchong, Fu Ruling, and other staff. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting, and Shao Yuanchong delivered a report entitled "Construction and National Revival," which stated that the Party has not yet completed the various tasks of construction and national revival. The reason for this is that it has been oppressed by imperialism from the outside, and internally, it has failed to achieve consensus, which has prevented the nation's spirit, wealth, and time from being concentrated and directed towards planned and effective efforts, and has even wasted them on useless endeavors. It must be understood that the responsibility for reviving the nation must be completed under the leadership of the Party. The most important thing is to make the people deeply believe in the Party and to have a close alliance between the Party and the people. Only then can the nation's spirit and wealth be concentrated. For example, in terms of developing the Northwest, it is not necessary to send people who understand the general situation in the Northwest, but rather people who are familiar with a certain small part of the endeavor and have specialized skills. The same is true for the revival of the nation. It is only necessary for each person to exert their efforts in their own profession or specialized field and serve the country. The way to revive the nation lies in this. The meeting adjourned at 9:00 AM after the speech. (13th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Beiping City Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government held a joint Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 13th. More than 100 leading officials and staff from the two organizations attended. Yuan Liang presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, Cheng Yuanfan reported on the financial situation of Beiping City, stating that the finances of Beiping City were originally in a state of deficit. Last year was a time of military conflict, and tax revenues were sharply reduced. In addition, there were considerable deficits and debts from previous administrations. However, after austerity measures were taken, the old debts were paid off. Since September of last year, tax revenues have gradually improved. As of June of this year, total revenue was统计5.2 million, and expenditures exceeded 200,000. After repaying the old debts of 260,000, it can be said that income and expenditure have been balanced. The major sources of income for Beiping City's finances are house taxes, shop taxes, vehicle taxes, deed taxes, and business taxes. In the past, there were often cases of tax evasion. After thorough rectification, the income has increased. From July of last year to June of this year, business taxes totaled 560,000, an average of 46,000 per month, which is an improvement. Regarding the abolition of excessive miscellaneous taxes, Beiping City has long been determined, and the central government has set a deadline of the end of December of this year. It will be implemented by the deadline. In addition, regarding land issues, the Finance Bureau specifically established a section in July. In the future, the work will first start with surveying and investigation, surveying and mapping a general map of the entire city of Beiping, and drawing sectional and segmented maps, and then proceed with determining property rights, land registration, and land valuation. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM after the speech. (13th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Foreign Silver Subsidiary Coins Are Not Included in This Exception (Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance issued an order to the customs superintendents of all ports, stating that the previous order from the Executive Yuan to prohibit the import of foreign silver coins in large quantities was already instructed to be followed by this Ministry's order on May 14th of the 19th year of the Republic. Later, a letter was received from the Consulate General in New York inquiring whether Mexican silver dollars (墨洋) were still legally applicable without restrictions in China. A letter was sent in reply that Mexican silver dollars were no longer allowed to be imported, and the prohibition had been communicated to all. Now, after investigation, foreign silver coins can be divided into two types: one is the commonly used silver coins on the market, such as Eagle dollars (Mexican silver dollars), Person dollars (Standing Liberty silver dollars), and Japanese dollars (Dragon coins); the other is silver subsidiary coins from other countries. Regarding the first type, the Eagle dollar was cast in Mexico for trade with the East, and the situation of the Person dollar is the same. The Japanese dollar is a currency that has been abolished in that country. None of them are legal tender commonly used in their own countries and should all be prohibited from import to uphold national dignity and purify the currency policy. As for the second type, silver subsidiary coins from other countries cannot be used in our country and are only carried by travelers. After arriving at the port, they are exchanged at small money shops, which has nothing to do with our country's currency policy and can be allowed to be imported. In addition to reporting this regulation to the Executive Yuan for record and issuing separate orders, it is hereby ordered that the superintendent instruct the customs officer to follow this order.

<h3 id="e28">Nationalization of Silver Policy and the American Economic Crisis <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign news reported that the U.S. government has announced the nationalization of silver policy. The content of the announcement generally stipulates that all silver existing in the market within the United States must be handed over to the mint within three months from August 9th onwards, with the official price set at US$0.501 per ounce (the official price for raw silver from mines remains at $0.645). Such a large purchase of silver by the United States has not only attracted worldwide attention but will also have a tremendous impact on countries like ours that use silver as the basis of payment. Therefore, we must first fundamentally understand the true nature of the U.S. silver policy before we can speculate on the effectiveness of the nationalization of silver policy. Since Roosevelt took office, the fundamental policy of the U.S. government has been to seek ways to restore the prosperity of the gold standard, which has already disappeared in the world. Therefore, in terms of monetary policy, it first abandoned the gold standard on April 20, 1933, on the one hand to avoid the collapse of domestic financial organizations and on the other hand to intensify the United States' offensive in the world market. When the ambitions of the major countries participating in the London Conference were fully exposed last July, Roosevelt, witnessing that the world crisis could still not be eliminated, decided to adopt a two-pronged approach, setting a thorough policy of concentrating cash and inflating the currency. The gold purchase movement in late October last year, the silver purchase bill in May this year, and the recent nationalization of silver law are all based on this consistent spirit. The practical significance of so-called currency inflation is nothing more than giving a discount to labor costs on the one hand and raising the competitive strength of American goods in the international market on the other hand. Originally, after the price of silver rose, first, the silver-using countries' market could experience a temporary increase in purchasing power, and second, the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar would tend to fall when the nationalization of silver was announced and large-scale foreign silver purchases were carried out. These are all important steps in Roosevelt's (optimistically successful) monetary policy.</p>
<p>What will be the reaction of other industrial countries to the U.S. silver policy? During the period of several evolutions of the U.S. monetary policy in the past year or so, Britain's Exchange Equalisation Account has increased by £200 million, and its active integration of the Sterling Area is no less than an important tool to help it carry out the exchange rate war. As for the European Gold Bloc countries under the leadership of France, their national fiscal austerity plans, as well as plans to reduce wages, interest rates, and rents, are another form of group to counter the U.S. monetary policy. Now that the United States has decided to carry out a large-scale silver purchase method, on the one hand, it is no less than explaining that the purpose of its past gold purchase movement has not been fully realized, and at the same time, it also points out that it has begun to wage a more acute market war against industrial countries such as Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. However, such a heated market war can only intensify world panic, and the question of how to raise purchasing power remains unresolved.</p>
<p>The above has already stated that the basic purpose of the U.S. silver policy is to restore the country's already vanished prosperity. Roosevelt's policies in the past year or so have taken this as their starting point. However, what is the effect? You can understand by looking at the recent months of surging labor strikes in the United States. We can now see from the law on the return of silver to national ownership that Roosevelt is still unwilling to abandon his past policies. Although we dare not say that this is a (last-gasp) phenomenon, we can only admit that it is a powerful tonic.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Stalemate in Sino-Soviet Negotiations over Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Insists on Original Position Ineffective Direct Negotiations by Puppet Regime Japanese Military Personnel Hinder Railway Administration (Changchun) It is currently believed here that negotiations for the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) are likely to break down. International disputes regarding this matter are causing considerable concern. The (Manchukuo) government has stated that the current situation will not affect other issues between (Manchukuo) and Russia. (13th Reuters Telegram) (Tokyo) As a result of discussions between (Manchukuo) representative Ohashi and the Japanese government, it has been decided to commence direct negotiations for the sale of the CER with the Soviet representative. Since Soviet Russia has rejected Foreign Minister Hirota's compromise plan, there is no way to resolve this issue other than direct negotiations between the two countries. (13th Japan News Agency) (Tokyo) Regarding the negotiations for the sale of the CER, (Manchukuo) Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi met with the Soviet Union's ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, and discussed the matter for two and a half hours from 4:00 PM to 6:25 PM today, without achieving any results. Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi is scheduled to depart from Tokyo for Manchukuo on the 14th. Judging from this situation, the CER negotiations are completely stalled and can be said to be on the verge of collapse. (13th Japan News Agency) (Moscow) Since Soviet Russia rejected Japan's terms for the sale of the CER, Russo-Japanese relations have deteriorated. Soviet newspapers are competing to publish anti-Japanese remarks, exposing the current state of the CER, such as banditry, and claiming that these disturbances are all instigated by Japan, considering it a form of blackmail by Japan. Soviet newspapers are also trying to make the people understand the significance of Japan's future military seizure of the CER, saying that Soviet Russia will never allow Japan's unreasonable actions. (12th National Telegram) (Moscow) According to a report from Khabarovsk, the director of the CER, Rutai, has reported to the Soviet Union's Ministry of Railways that the Japanese military authorities (stationed at the Suifenhe Station) have announced that a section of the CER near the Suifenhe Station, except for a narrow path along the tracks, is a prohibited area. It is divided into two special zones. The first zone strictly prohibits foreigners from entering, so the area will be excluded from the scope of activity, and there will be no railway employees or management. The second zone (including the town of Suifenhe) is allowed to enter, but it is forbidden to construct any buildings, defenses, afforestation, or other surveying projects in the area, and violators will be subject to heavy penalties. Rutai also reported to the Ministry of Railways that the various regulations set by the Japanese military are used to prohibit the CER authorities from managing the railway affairs in the area and from making necessary repairs to the railway property. At the same time, there are also reports that the Japanese-Manchukuo police have begun a movement against the clubs of the CER employees and workers. These clubs were only restored a few days ago after repeated requests from the Soviet Union's consul. A certain police station has strictly sealed off the club at the Handaohezi (translated) station, and there is no reason for the closure. (12th TASS Telegram) (Harbin) Today, official sources released the details of the Soviet plot to assassinate a large number of Japanese and (Manchukuo) officials, causing a great shock. It is said that this case was discovered when a Russian watchman hired by the Japanese military committee in Suifenhe was killed. The list of people targeted for assassination included the director of the Japanese military committee, the commander of the Japanese military police, important (Manchukuo) government officials, and the patrol chief of the CER Suifenhe police station. More than 30 Soviet Russians related to the case have been arrested. The Japanese military authorities also claim that there are documents proving that the Soviet military command in Khabarovsk ordered (Chinese bandits to destroy the CER train in the area near Yimianpo).

<p>Worry about Tense Relations Between Japan and Russia (London) Britain is paying renewed attention to the Far East. Newspaper commentaries on this matter occupy a large amount of space. Some newspapers express satisfaction with Britain's dispatch of an economic investigation team to Manchuria, while others express concern about the tension between Japan and Russia. The Daily Express stated that "Asian winds are shaking. Japan really wants to gain complete control of the CER and sweep away Soviet Russia's influence in Manchuria. Foreign Minister Hirota said that Japan's proposal regarding the transfer of the CER, which was rejected by Soviet Russia, was the last time. Soviet newspapers are telling the public that major events are about to happen. In fact, the ownership of the CER and the sovereignty of (Manchukuo) are not the real reasons for the difficulties between Japan and Russia. Japan's intention is to include (Manchukuo), Inner Mongolia, North China, and Russian Turkestan, and establish an Asian empire. Japanese Navy Minister Osumi said, 'There is currently no reason to prevent Japan from developing to this extent.' "The News Chronicle is quite worried about peace, saying that the aggressor must undoubtedly be Japan. At this moment, what endangers peace is definitely not Russia. This can be seen from Japan's handling of the CER transfer negotiations. "We should know that a part of Japan's powerful public opinion advocates a preemptive war in Manchuria, and Japan's successive restrictions on the management of the CER are indeed provocative. In Japan, it is said that Soviet Russia is preparing to join the League of Nations and conclude various treaties with Western countries in order to avoid worrying about the West and maintain freedom of action in the Far East. Once this view is analyzed, it is known that it has no basis. In fact, Japan has already lost its original position in the international community. What Soviet Russia is doing is just to gain connections in the international community. It is hoped that Japan can think deeply before provoking international public opinion for the second time."

<p>Lies in the Strength of the Soviet Air Force (Paris) Today, the royalist newspaper Action Française published an article stating that the French government's focus in French-Russian cooperation is the strength of the Soviet Air Force. Therefore, the French military and politicians have a very good impression of the French-Russian alliance because, in the event of war, Soviet aircraft squadrons can directly bomb Berlin without much difficulty, which is something France cannot do. However, Soviet aircraft's attack on the German capital must pass through other countries. Poland may not be willing to allow Russian aircraft to pass through at will, and Romania and Czechoslovakia are the inevitable routes for Russian aircraft. However, it is also a question whether these two countries will allow Russian aircraft to pass through. Therefore, according to the newspaper's observation, France's alliance with Russia and loss of Poland is like lip service that does not reach reality, which is a mistake. (12th National Telegram) (Paris) French Air Minister General Denain hosted a banquet for Soviet aviators, with a total of seventy guests attending. During the banquet, General Denain praised the Soviet aviators for the achievements they had made in repeated, brave, and extraordinary flights, and especially praised the flight personnel who rescued the Chelyuskin crew. Finally, he hoped that the flight cooperation between the Soviet Union and France would continue endlessly for the benefit of peace. Rosenbaum, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Union's embassy in France, replied, "I hope that Franco-Soviet friendship will become the core of the two countries' foreign policies." Usheltsov, the leader of the Soviet aviation delegation, praised France as the leader in conquering the air and thanked General Denain for his hospitality.

<h3 id="e34">Trend of the Eastern European Pact <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Opposition from Germany and Poland (London) If the hopes of the major politicians can be realized, a system of peace pacts and defense alliances will soon be established to ensure peace in Europe. The Eastern European Pact, which France recently conformed to the Soviet Union's intention and obtained the support of Britain and Italy, is one end. The pact covers seven countries: Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Soviet Russia. Each signatory country should not only respect other signatory countries but also assist them in resisting aggression from another signatory country or a country outside the pact. Although France is not a signatory country, it is the guarantor of the pact. The main point is that France guarantees the western border of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union guarantees the eastern border of France, and Germany and the Soviet Union guarantee the Polish border. Except for Germany and Poland, all related countries and some countries without direct relations have approved the pact. Germany's attitude is very indifferent, believing that the net cast by the pact is nothing more than to make Germany recognize the borders delineated by the Treaty of Versailles. Unless France recognizes Germany's military equality, it is impossible to make Germany comply. There is also a price to pay for Poland to accept the pact. Poland claims that its ally Romania should participate in the pact and requires that each signatory country guarantee the current Polish-Lithuanian border in order to have all countries recognize the legality of its annexation of the Vilnius region. If the seven-power pact fails, we can believe that France, Soviet Russia, and Czechoslovakia will sign a three-power defense alliance and put Germany in a great encirclement. The so-called Eastern European Locarno Pact will be related to other important treaties. First, the pact will be combined with the Western European Locarno Pact signed by Germany, France, Britain, Italy, and Belgium in 1925 to guarantee the borders of Germany and France and Belgium. Second, the pact will also be related to the Little Entente, with Czechoslovakia as the key role in the Eastern European Locarno system. (13th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Rumor that Minister Will Be Promoted to Ambassador The Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini may discuss the issue of upgrading the Italian embassy in Vienna to an embassy next month when they meet in Rome. The Italian government may appoint Undersecretary of State Suvich or Italian Ambassador to England Grandi as the ambassador to Austria. This seems to be in response to Germany's appointment of von Papen as the ambassador to Austria. However, it has not yet been determined whether the issue of upgrading the embassy will be discussed during the meeting between the Austrian Deputy Prime Minister Prince Starhemberg and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, because Prince Starhemberg is only visiting friends and exercising today, so he has not met with the Italian Prime Minister. (12th Reuters Telegram) (Paris) Parisian newspapers carried a message today stating that the Italian embassy in Austria will soon be upgraded to an embassy and that the current Undersecretary of State Suvich will be appointed as the first ambassador to Austria. As for the Austrian ambassador to Rome, it is rumored that the current Austrian ambassador to Paris, Dr. Murwald, has been internally designated, but this matter has not yet been officially confirmed. (12th National Telegram) Rome According to today's news, it is widely believed that the Austrian Deputy Prime Minister Prince Starhemberg must have discussed the issue of the restoration of the Austrian monarchy with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Oesterreich. According to well-informed Italian sources, the Italian Prime Minister stated that the restoration of the monarchy is not a practical issue. Italy believes that Austria can maintain its independence without the need for restoration. It is heard that Starhemberg has presented to the Italian Prime Minister the details of the failed Austrian Nazi Party uprising on July 25 and the current internal situation in Austria. Starhemberg also stated to the Italian Prime Minister that Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg's determination to maintain Austria's independence and adhere to the policies of former Prime Minister Dollfuss is supported by the Italian Prime Minister. People in Rome believe that the current situation has not changed slightly due to the assassination of Prime Minister Dollfuss. Austria can still rely on the strong support of the Italian Prime Minister to maintain its independence. (13th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) At the time when President Roosevelt prohibited the sale of arms to Bolivia and Paraguay, the profits made by American arms manufacturers from the Chaco War averaged seven U.S. dollars per minute, which shows the scale of the American arms industry. The total value of arms sold to Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, China, and Japan in January this year was US$47,578,484. Three months later, it fell to US$43,257,431. When President Roosevelt intervened, Bolivia was the third largest customer of American arms, with Japan first and China second. Officials from the Paraguayan embassy said that Paraguay had stopped purchasing American arms before the embargo order. Official figures show that in April this year, Bolivia purchased machine guns and rifles worth US$310,065, Japan US$7,999,258, and China US$1,064,801. Okada Considers</p>

<p>Senator Thomas of Chicago advocates immediately raising the price of gold to $41.34 per ounce, in accordance with the maximum price stipulated in the 1933 Gold Act. Speaking at the Century of Progress Exhibition, Thomas insisted that inflating the currency is the only way to offset the current excessive purchasing power of gold and restore the gold standard value of 1926 under Coolidge. Thomas urged the government to take drastic steps to relieve debt and save the majority of the nation trapped in debt. Thomas stated that this relief can only be achieved through currency inflation. A gold price of $41.34 is double the previous statutory value and equal to that of a silver half-dollar, enabling debtors to repay their debts with dollars of the same value as when they borrowed. Currently, debtors must pay between $1.35 and $1.50 for every dollar of debt borrowed during commercial prosperity and boom times, and immediately raising the current gold price (currently $35 per ounce) is the most reasonable and effective method of his proposed inflation policy. Thomas continued, broadly using silver will also help the country's economic recovery. Preparing silver as part of the national currency is the second practical way to reduce the purchasing power of gold. It is generally believed that Mr. Thomas' speech today is a harbinger of future inflationary movements. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Rear Admiral Byrd, a famous American explorer, set out with his team from the Bay of Little America in Virginia on October 22 last year for his second Antarctic expedition. Before departing, Byrd firmly stated that this expedition was not aimed at flying over the South Pole, but rather at continuing to collect materials about an unexplored land area almost the size of South America. His main base was set up in the Bay of Wales, and Byrd inspected from a camp 123 miles away, where he spent the winter. Byrd subsequently fell into a dangerous situation due to the melting ice. Today, the National Geographic Society received news that Byrd had been rescued. Although physically weak, his spirit was still good. The rescue team, led by Dr. Poulter, set off from Little America on August 8. After two failures, they finally reached Byrd's observation post. The first two attempts were driven back by strong winds. On Wednesday of last week, they made a third attempt, and with the help of specially made snowmobiles, they succeeded. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

After the accident, all the lights in the station went out. Rescue workers rushed to the scene, but due to the darkness, rescue was difficult. The locomotive of the fast train caught fire, threatening to spread to the passenger cars, so the rescue workers first focused on this. The injured moaned and cried out in pain, a tragic scene to behold. The number of dead and injured is not yet known, but it is known that there were no British or American passengers on the train. Rescue workers carried the injured out of the train and into the station for first aid, and also summoned nearby doctors to come and provide assistance. All four main lines at Avignon station were blocked and are currently being cleared. The cause of the accident is unknown, but many believe it was caused by the fast train traveling at excessive speed. Many police officers have also been dispatched to the accident site to assist in the rescue work, and officials are currently conducting an investigation.

<p>Bombings Occur Everywhere Havana today marks the first anniversary of the overthrow of former President Machado's government. A general strike has broken out throughout the city's transportation system, along with riots and multiple bombings. A bomb exploded at a Nationalist political club, seriously injuring two women. This is indeed a prelude to demonstrations in the Cuban capital. After the bombings, the police immediately took action, and vehicles and pedestrians near the political club were inspected, but the authorities did not capture any trace of the bomber. The general strike by transportation workers has obvious political undertones. National telephone, telegraph, and wireless communications have all been suspended. Although the strikers demanded the immediate release of reinstatement money, it is heard that the real reason for the strike is that the workers insist on dismissing all officials who had previously participated in the Machado government. President Madieta convened a cabinet meeting and immediately ordered transportation workers to resume work first, while the government would consider the workers' demands within forty-eight hours, but the government's proposal has been rejected by labor leaders. Workers at the power plant then held a meeting to decide to strike in support of transportation workers. Madieta immediately mobilized troops, and armed patrols were densely deployed near all main roads, power plants, and public utilities. The government's drastic steps have made the demonstrators lose courage. The whole city is relatively quiet tonight, but there are still bombings in the suburbs, but they have not caused major disasters. (National Telegram, 12th) Havana The strike situation here has not changed. Telegraphic communication remains blocked.

<h3 id="e92">Public Telegram <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from the Drought Relief Committee of Guichi County, Anhui, to the Shanghai Shen Bao office to be forwarded to various newspaper offices, charitable organizations, and disaster relief agencies: The drought in Guichi is severe, food is scarce, and the people are on the verge of death, with no guarantee for the next day. Regarding the actual situation of the disaster in the county this year, apart from the newly reclaimed polder land along the river where beans and miscellaneous grains can only yield 20% of the harvest, the majority of the farmland, totaling over 30,000 mu, which is subject to regular taxation, is all located in depressions and relies on rainwater for irrigation. During the early spring rice transplanting season, prolonged cold weather delayed the growth of seedlings. By early summer, temperatures gradually rose, and because the reservoirs dried up, irrigation was untimely, causing the rice plants to wither. In addition, continuous drought and scorching heat turned the lush greenery into scorched stubble. According to statistics, the loss of rice this time is estimated to be over 1.2 million shi, which is ten times worse than previous years of flooding. It is a rare catastrophe in centuries. Currently, the situation in the rural areas is precarious. The autumn harvest is hopeless, and the people are already panicking about food. They are unable to save themselves and can only look to the heavens for sustenance. Feeling the pain deeply, we send this telegram to call for help. We implore your newspaper to embrace the spirit of universal aid, with sympathy in your hearts. You have always valued humanity and served as the voice of the people. Therefore, we earnestly request that you publish the tragic situation of our county's disaster in your newspaper. If you could show compassion and grant us relief, the virtue of rebirth would be bestowed upon us by your esteemed newspaper. Sincerely, Drought Relief Committee of Guichi County, Anhui. Survey by the Sichuan Pacification Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Detailed Information on the Bandit Area of Wanyuan <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Rural Areas Bankrupt, People Sit and Wait to Die.</p>
<p>People's Militia Resist Communists, Killing Thousands of Bandits.</p>
<p>Epidemics Spread, Coffins Become Empty. Chengdu Air Mail Report: The Sichuan bandits have been holding out in Wanyuan for almost two years. The people have resisted the Communists barehanded, one after another, seizing thousands of bandits' weapons and killing thousands of bandits. Although Wanyuan City has been gained and lost three times, the bandits have not been driven out of the territory. However, their brave, resolute, and indomitable spirit is truly commendable. Therefore, we record the recent survey report by Zhou Bao Han and other members of the Sichuan Pacification Committee on the recovered area of Wanyuan on the left:</p>

<p>During this inspection, we traveled more than 300 li within Wanyuan. We saw very few farmers in the fields, and less than half of the rice paddies had been planted. It is said that farmers avoid conscription during the day and quietly plant at night. The anti-bandit army (such as the units of Liu Guangyu and Yang Guozhen) also helped with planting. The land is completely barren. After the wheat harvest, farmers mostly rely on potatoes, wheat, and barley for food, but the harvest is meager and quickly exhausted. In the sixth and seventh lunar months (the autumn harvest in Wanyuan is usually around mid-August), farmers are left with empty pots. Before Chengkou fell, the corn imported from there was still sufficient to provide relief. Now, although Chengkou has been recovered, the source of food is still difficult to secure for the time being. This requires finding a way to provide relief. In past years, Wanyuan produced about 3,000 jin of white fungus and about 200,000 jin of tea in the spring, worth about 300,000 yuan. This was enough to boost the city's economy, and farmers used it to exchange for rice, food, and utensils. Now, both tea and fungus are gone, and they are sitting and waiting to die. Able-bodied men and women are rarely seen in farmhouses. Either they have been forcibly conscripted by the Communists, died of disease at home, or are lying sick in bed. Those who have not experienced it firsthand may not believe this phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Epidemics <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Another terrible phenomenon in the recovered area is the prevalence of epidemics, with a large number of deaths. The people in the county, having been under the bandits for a long time, those who fled and those who remained, all feel that their lives are out of order. In addition, the Communists killed too many people, all buried shallowly. The Communists killed by the Sacred Mother Corps were left unburied in the fields. After a long time, the stench of corpses spread everywhere. Since the beginning of spring, a major epidemic has broken out. Medicine is in short supply, and once infected, people can only sit and wait to die. As a result, deaths are rampant and difficult to stop. The average number of deaths per household is two or more, and there are also reports of entire families of more than ten people dying. Coffins everywhere have long been used up. It is common to see wealthy families unable to find a wooden coffin for their parents after they die, and they cannot keep the bodies at home for long, so they are mostly buried simply (wrapped in mats). The deaths of soldiers and laborers are also everywhere, especially among the laborers. The symptoms of the epidemic are initially dizziness and pain, followed by fever all over the body, thirst, panic, chest tightness, and loss of appetite. If the medicine is administered properly (usually Chonghe Tang), a large amount of sweat will be expelled from the body, which is called "turning sweat." After turning sweat, further relief can be given with a soothing agent (roughly Minor Bupleurum Decoction plus White Tiger Decoction), and gradual recovery will be achieved. If there is no major sweat within one, three, or five days after taking the medicine, it is very dangerous. If there is no sweat for seven days, death is certain. During the turning of sweat, some may also experience nosebleeds, which is called "turning red sweat." This is a sign that danger can be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Militia Resistance <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>In mid-October of last year, the Communists came to attack. The stationed troops were ordered to abandon Wanyuan. The Wanyuan regular militia, unable to retreat in time, the entire Second Platoon was surrounded by the Communists. The regular militia and civilians then gradually gathered in Qishugou, Guankouping, Kuchouping, and other places on the border of Xuanhan and Kaixian counties, totaling about 1,000 men and guns. Because the head of the militia bureau, Zhu, had fled to Wanxian early, Zhang Ziyi, the head of the public security bureau, was publicly elected to lead the resistance against the Communists. At that time, supplies were difficult, and the enemy was pursuing closely. The hardship and suffering were self-evident. Later, contact was made with Chen Guoshu, the commander of the Chengwan guerrilla forces, and they were placed under his command and organized into two detachments, totaling about ten companies. Supplies were also provided by him gradually, but cotton clothing and bedding were lacking. They have suffered greatly in the snowy and icy weather. Starting on January 3rd of this year, the militia counterattacked and recovered the entire territory of the second and third districts with the support of the villagers, only 60 li from Wanyuan City. On February 4th, the Communists launched a counterattack with the main force of three or four regiments and a special task battalion. The militia was unable to resist, and they were reinforced by the Jinxiong and Yu detachments, but they were still unable to resist. They then retreated to the Hongmiaozi and Fanhuai stores area on the Xuanwan border. On March 20th, when they attacked the Gujunba of Wanyuan again, the Sacred Mother Corps had already defeated the bandits. The county seat was recovered, and the militia entered the city to help defend it. Xun's and Du's detachments from Wang Sanchun's unit also entered the city one after another, for about a week. The bandits increased their main force to counterattack, and the militia was caught off guard and unprepared, so they abandoned it again and retreated to Baisha River and Qinghua Creek, 60 li from the city. On April 17th, the militia, in conjunction with Chen Guoshu's entire force, Jin Zhitang's unit of Wanyuan civilians, and Yang Shiyuan's unit of the Sacred Mother Corps, recaptured the county seat. On May 2nd, the bandits counterattacked again, and it fell again on the 4th. The various units still retreated to their original lines. Currently, due to deaths in battle, deaths from epidemics, and returns home due to illness, only about half of the militia is defending the front line against the bandits.</p>
<h3 id="e97">People's Anti-Communism <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>When the Communists occupied Wanyuan, most of the people who fled were former and current government employees, accounting for no more than one-tenth. A large number of people stayed at home. After the Communists came, they reversed the traditional customs of the people and brutally murdered them. As a result, the people of the second, third, eighth, ninth, and tenth districts of Wanyuan resisted the Communists four times in November and December of last year and January and February of this year, remotely echoing the militia. They slaughtered many Communists and killed quite a few Communist political personnel. Quan Zhitang's unit in the second district was able to resist the bandits from beginning to end and attacked very vigorously. Quan is a man from Caojiagou, about 60 years old, who once served as a regimental leader. He has several sons, all of whom are farmers, strong and able, who assist their father in mobilizing the people of Caojiagou to firmly defend and not flee. They occasionally led the villagers to attack the bandits' Soviet, but when they lacked food and utensils, they would confiscate the villages where the bandits concentrated food and utensils to replenish their supplies. During the months when Wanyuan was in the bandit area, Caojiagou alone was able to preserve itself. Sometimes they even lured the bandits deep into an ambush, and none of the bandits escaped.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Sacred Mother Corps' Military Achievements <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>At first, the people thought that even if the Communists came, they would not cut off their lifeline. When they saw the increasing harm caused by the Communists, the people became determined to resist the Communists, and guerrilla units defected one after another. The bandits believed that the people of Wanyuan could not be utilized, so they carried out large-scale massacres and set fires everywhere. At this time, the people were desperate and prayed day and night to the gods they believed in to save them. This is how the Sacred Mother Corps was born, or perhaps it was a type of hypnosis. According to the Corps' proclamation, "The Red Bandits have plagued Sichuan for years, and the people have been displaced and died in droves. Among them, brave people have resisted the Communists many times, but they have not achieved complete victory. Fortunately, Wu Xiling, who has been farming for generations and enjoys doing good deeds, witnessed the rampant behavior of the Red Bandits and appealed to the Sacred Mother to save the people. He fasted for days, and his sincerity moved the Sacred Mother to bestow upon Xiling on the 26th day of the first month at the hour of Hai (9-11 PM), personally instructing him on the tactics of suppressing the bandits and the skills of boxing and fighting. The people were initially skeptical, but after the battle of Changba, they won three victories in three battles, and spread the word to various churches to establish the Sacred Mother Corps for suppressing bandits and saving the people. As a result, they captured more than a dozen market towns, recovered Wanyuan City, and obtained a machine gun and countless bullets. They also strictly ordered that they not take anything from the people." Before the third month of the lunar calendar, the Corps fought dozens of battles, large and small, with the bandits, and always won with fewer against more. According to reliable investigations, at least a thousand real Red Bandits were killed. At that time, the Communists were terrified at the mere mention of their name and seemed ready to flee at the sight of them. They called them the "Bladder Soldiers" and paid close attention to preventing them. After the bandits understood the situation of the Corps, they avoided them in fortifications to deal with them, and sometimes took advantage of the night to surround and burn the crowds inside the Sacred Mother Corps' churches, resulting in mutual casualties. Moreover, the Corps lacked supplies, organization, and training, relying solely on wooden knives and other weapons to resist the bandits, who were capable of raging frenzy. It is only right that they could only sustain a single burst of energy. However, at present, in the second, third, and eighth districts, there are still many of its members, who often coordinate with the anti-bandit army in combat and serve as vanguards. An investigation revealed that the members of the Corps are all rural farmers with dark faces. The weapons they use are wooden knives and wooden sticks, with knife and axe teams following behind. The leader is a general or child in red clothing, leading the way with a duster in hand. In times of emergency, with a single call along the way, women and children would follow, and farm tools and wooden sticks would all become weapons. Their spirit of courageously advancing, pursuing and attacking bandits, fearing neither death nor surrender, has caused the Communists to retreat three times in awe. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>＝Rivers Rise Due to Continuous Torrential Rains＝</p>
<p>＝Dozens of Counties Suffer Major Disasters＝ Kaifeng Correspondence: Due to continuous torrential rains in Henan Province, rivers have risen sharply. Dozens of counties, including Shangcai, Shangshui, Linying, Fengqiu, Suiping, Runan, Yancheng, Xiping, Wuyang, Tanghe, Yexian, Xihua, Fangcheng, Xiangcheng, Fugou, Taikang, Yanling, Weishi, Biyang, Qinyang, and Xin'an, have suffered disasters. Recently, many counties have reported flooding to the Provincial Relief Association. According to Changge County, heavy rains fell for three days, the 24th, 25th, and 26th of last month, and the Bo River overflowed, destroying more than 2,900 houses and inundating more than 24,000 mu of farmland in 19 villages including Dongfuzhuang. More than 1,000 houses were destroyed and more than 30,000 mu of farmland were inundated in 17 villages including Tianwucun. The Linying River also breached its banks, and the water depth from Shangzhuang in the Second District to Pingning City and other places was more than ten feet, navigable by boat, destroying more than 1,700 qing of land. Heavy rains fell again on the 5th of this month, and more than five zhang of the county city wall collapsed. The first, third, and fourth districts suffered severe damage again. After the rain in Tongxu, boats could sail on land and reach Fugou. Fifty li from Nandaizhuang to Xiaoqinggang and other villages in Taikang became a vast swamp. In Baofeng, the water depth was several feet, and the disaster was particularly severe in the third and fourth districts due to the overflowing of the Sha River. Yancheng suffered two floods, and all 7,000 qing of autumn crops were submerged, with less than 20% remaining. The Sha River breached its banks in five places, the Li River and the Gan River each breached their banks in four places, and the Ying River breached its banks in twenty places. The most tragic was Heya Li Village on the banks of the Sha River, where the houses, food, livestock of more than 200 households were completely washed away. More than 50 other villages were also affected, and more than 100,000 victims were all living outdoors and exposed to the elements. (August 11) Shaanxi Province</p>
<h3 id="e100">Overview of Population Distribution <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Continuous Years of Famine Lead to Extremely Low Population Density</p>
<p>Shanxi Residents Dominate Shaanxi's Commerce. Xi'an Correspondence: The ethnic issues in the Northwest have become extremely serious, but the migration of people to the Northwest is still not being paid attention to. Here is a brief description of the investigation in Shaanxi:</p>
<h3 id="e101">Population Density <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>According to a survey by the Shaanxi Autonomous Region Preparatory Office in 1924, the population of Shaanxi was 21,193,351. In September 1933, the Ministry of Interior, based on the statistical report of 1930, the population of Shaanxi was 10,296,531. In 1932, a survey by the Shaanxi Civil Affairs Department showed that the population of Shaanxi was 9,752,015. The first two surveys were too long ago and may not be accurate. Although the third survey was only two years ago, in the past year (1933), the counties in Shaanxi that suffered from water, drought, wind, hail, black frost, bandits, epidemics, and plague accounted for two-thirds and a half of all counties in the province, so it seems unreliable. According to a survey by the Party Headquarters, the population of Wugong County has decreased by more than two-thirds since the famine. By analogy, the number of people reduced in Shaanxi over the years will definitely not be less than 500,000. According to the investigations of recent academic groups and various surveyors and highway surveyors, all say that there is too much wasteland in the counties of Shaanxi. This can also indirectly prove that the population of Shaanxi is not large. In short, the current population of Shaanxi cannot exceed 9 million. If this population is compared with the area of Shaanxi, which is 195,067 square kilometers, the average number of people per square kilometer is less than five (based on Zeng Shiying's estimate of the area of Shaanxi). The scarcity of population density can be seen here. At the same time, the reason why residents of neighboring provinces with higher population densities migrate westward is not difficult to understand. Among the residents who have migrated to Shaanxi from neighboring provinces, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong provinces account for the most. The number of residents who have migrated to Shaanxi from other provinces is relatively small.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Shanxi Residents <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The people who have migrated to Shaanxi from Shanxi are distributed in the widest area, but most are in northern Shaanxi and Guanzhong. There are many Shanxi people in Yulin and Fuguo in northern Shaanxi, and Tongguan, Chaoyi, Dali, Chang'an, Xianyang, Sanyuan in Guanzhong. Almost all of them are engaged in business. Eight out of ten of the larger businesses in Shaanxi are run by Shanxi people. Among them, the salt industry, sauce gardens, groceries, and silver firms are almost monopolized by Shanxi people. The saying that Shanxi people are good at business is by no means an exaggeration. I once saw a couplet on the door of a salt store in Xi'an that said, "Transporting a piece of jade from eastern Jin, exchanging it for ten thousand taels of gold from western Qin." It is indeed a true portrayal of the people of Shanxi. The ways that Shanxi people enter Shaanxi are: (1) Crossing the Yellow River from Fenglingdu, taking the road to Tongguan and westward; (2) Crossing the Yellow River near Qikou in Shanxi, passing through Wubao and Suide, southward, or northward through Mizhi to Yulin; (3) Crossing the Yellow River near Baode in Shanxi to Fuguo, passing through Shenmu to Yulin; (4) Crossing the Yellow River from Puzhou (Yongji) in Shanxi through Daqing Pass (Pujin Pass), passing through Chaoyi and Dali, to Weinan County; (5) Crossing the Yellow River from Yongheguan in Yonghe County, Shanxi, to Yanchuan County; (6) Crossing the Yellow River from Liulin Ferry in Yongning County, Shanxi, to Wubao County. Among them, Tongguan is the main road, and there is the most traffic.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Henan Residents <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Residents who moved from Henan to Shaanxi mostly live scattered in areas south of the Han River, north of Shaanxi, and in counties stretching westward from Tongguan to Changwu. Their concentration points are in places like Chang'an, Nanzheng (i.e., Hanzhong), and Longju Village. They are mostly employed in handicrafts (coppersmiths, blacksmiths, barrel makers, cooks, carpenters) and manual labor (rickshaw pullers, boat pushers). The Henan residents in the Guanzhong area are mostly from Luoyang, Gongxian, Sishui, Wuzhi, Qinyang, Wenxian, and the Heishiguan area. The Henan residents in southern Shaanxi are mostly from Xichuan, Nanyang, and Lushi. Henan residents have the highest mobility. Every year after the old lunar year, people coming from west of Luoyang arrive in groups, each carrying a shoulder pole of goods, one after another, heading towards Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and other areas. They sell their goods as they go, and once sold, they return to places like Chang'an to wholesale more goods and head west again. Sometimes they make several such trips, eventually stopping in Gansu or Ningxia. Once they arrive, they buy local medicinal materials (such as licorice, goji berries, rhubarb, safflower, Tibetan green fruit) and carry them back to Henan for sale, or they buy ponies and drive them to the vicinity of Chang'an for sale. Quite a few people have become wealthy using this method. These people are extremely familiar with the conditions along the way, and there are many fellow villagers in major county towns (mostly engaged in photography and groceries), so the journey is peaceful and without unexpected dangers. There are four routes that Henan people take to enter Shaanxi: (1) from Tongguan through Huayin, Huaxian, Weinan, and Lintong westward; (2) from Shanzhou by Yellow River boat westward; (3) from Jingziguan, B亭, and Xichuan County, going upstream on the Dan River westward; (4) from Lushi County in Henan, through Muxianggou and Suxia, to Luonan in Shaanxi. The first two routes are the main routes for Henan to enter Shaanxi.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Shandong Residents <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>People who moved from Shandong to Shaanxi mostly live along the Wei River area, such as in Lintong, Sanyuan, and other places, where their footprints are abundant. Most of them are engaged in agriculture, and they like to live in groups to help and protect each other. The Shandong residents in the cities mostly engage in cloth and silk trade or drive large carts, going west to Gansu and Ningxia (there are many Shandong people in Ningxia). Shandong people entering Shaanxi mostly take the Tongguan route.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei Residents <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Since the Longhai Railway was extended to Tongguan, merchants from Tianjin and Hebei have set up branches in places like Xi'an in order to expand their businesses. Therefore, most of the Hebei residents currently in Shaanxi are engaged in hardware, foreign goods, military clothing, leather, cloth, sundries, photography, and medicinal materials. Those engaged in labor are mostly involved in driving cars and repairing cars. There are also many Hebei natives in the administrative circles. Since the government has focused on the actual development of the Northwest, more and more people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang have come to Shaanxi, but most of them live in Chang'an and hold positions in the political circles. After the September 18th Incident, the commerce of the Southeast was affected by the decline, and it was necessary to find other ways to develop. Therefore, there are many shops in Chang'an operated by people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, such as cigarette, silk, foreign goods, bookstore, and bank shops. There are not many Guangdong natives in Shaanxi, and most of them are engaged in photography. There are also one or two in the administrative circles. There is currently no accurate survey of how many people from other provinces are in Shaanxi. In short, Shaanxi's population density is very low. For the sake of the country's future and the survival of the nation, it is necessary to increase Shaanxi's population as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Opium Poison <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The reasons for the decline in Shaanxi's population are: (1) natural disasters, (2) man-made disasters, (3) opium, (4) diseases, such as trachoma, scabies, and goiter, which have become the most common diseases among Shaanxi people, (5) infanticide. It is said that in Yongshou and other areas in western Shaanxi, families often kill any children born after raising three children in order to reduce the burden. This kind of tragedy may also be caused by difficult living conditions. The healthiest ethnic group in the Northwest is the Hui people. They neither smoke opium nor have other bad habits, and their solidarity is particularly strong. This is truly the most promising ethnic group in our nation.

<h3 id="e107">Please Thoroughly Investigate the Grain Tax Corruption Case <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Song report: Wu Baohuang, member of the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office, Zhu Zhaosheng, director of the Songjiang Education Bureau, and others, petitioned Chairman Chen to thoroughly investigate the oppression and corruption case. The original petition stated that the Songjiang County government colluded to use the opportunity of converting land into grain transport and reducing the rent to jointly embezzle tens of thousands of yuan in tax money, damaging education funds. The case investigation found that the old Huating jurisdiction of this county included 34,639 mu, 1 li, and 6 si of converted land in the north of the Pu River, and 84,960 mu, 3 fen, 5 li, and 1 hao, 2 si in the south of the Pu River. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, when She Yingduo was the director of the Finance Bureau, he was ordered to convert it to grain transport and create a register for it, which was handled by the head of the Jingzheng Section, Che Zhao (a native of Songjiang), who is now the head of the Finance Section. The converted grain transport in the north of the Pu River was 3,260 shi, 6 dou, 4 sheng, and 9 ge, and each business household has cleared it annually. The converted grain transport in the south of the Pu River was 7,039 shi, 8 dou, 6 sheng, and 3 ge, and not all of the business households have fully paid. In summary, the annual levy of converted grain transport is about 5,000 shi or more. The price of each shi of grain transport was 5 yuan and 7 jiao in the 18th year, 7 yuan and 9 jiao in the 19th and 20th years, and 7 yuan and 7 jiao in the 21st year, averaging 7 yuan and 3 jiao. Ye Zongcheng, the director of the First Land Tax Collection Office, had a history of arrears and misappropriation. However, this item of approximately 10,300 shi of converted grain transport was included in the amount of actual levies and uncollected amounts in the autumn surveys over the years, and the Finance Bureau and the County Government filled in the forms and reported them, which can be verified. Che Zhao was the section chief during the tenure of former directors Shen Bingchen and Shen Binde. On May 1, last year (the 22nd year), the Finance Bureau was merged into the County Government, and County Chief Jin Tigan appointed Che Zhao as the head of the Finance Section because he was familiar with the contents of the grain counter. In September of that year, County Chief Jin, because some business households along the coast resisted completing the converted grain transport, used the method of reducing the rent to falsely claim that the coastal converted land and the converted land in the north of the Pu River were converted land in the south of the Pu River. In his reply to the Finance Department Commissioner Shen Zhengshu, he stated that more than 10,000 shi of converted grain transport in the south of the Pu River had not been received since the 18th year, and that it had to be reduced by 60% in the 22nd year and oppressively levied by 40% in the 18th year. After the Finance Department approved it, it deducted 10,299 shi, 9 dou, 5 sheng, and 2 he of converted grain transport from the amount of actual levies and uncollected amounts in the autumn surveys over the years. 10,300 shi and 6 he of converted grain transport in the 19th year, 10,300 shi, 5 dou, 1 sheng, and 2 he of converted grain transport in the 21st year, totaling 41,201 shi and 3 sheng and 8 he of converted grain transport in the north of the Pu River. However, the grain silver that the people had completed in the above four years, and the stamped coupons that had been intercepted, were not announced and returned or offset based on the coupons. (The 23rd year grain coupons notification was still created and stamped according to the unreduced amount. It is said that someone has reported it.) The amount of concealed converted grain transport that has been collected is no less than 20,000 shi, totaling about 150,000 to 160,000 yuan. About 30,000 yuan is for provincial education expenses, and about 12,000 yuan is for county education expenses. Most of the rest is for provincial funds. In June of this year, Yang Zhimin, a local, coveted the position of director of the collection office, and instigated Lu Boxin and others to file a report to the county party headquarters to expose him, first to coerce Director Ye to resign and allow Yang Zhimin's son, Yunwen, to succeed him. On July 1, County Chief Jin approved the change in order to appease the atmosphere and find a way to cover it up. But it was known to the outside world, and someone filed a complaint with the Finance Department (but the Finance Department only ordered the county to reply, which is no different from making the thief confess). The county party headquarters then decided to investigate the matters reported by Lu Boxin and sent a letter to the county to investigate thoroughly. The department committee director and bureau chief heard about it and successively reported to the county government, the education department, and the management office for instructions. County Chief Jin only sent the police to guard Director Ye on the 22nd of last month. However, County Chief Jin's instruction No. 2384 on July 18 stated that the government had heard about the alleged matters and had already ordered Ye, the former director of the First Land Tax Collection Office, to be responsible for verifying the Bao Tu, the embankment number, and the number of mu. A detailed inventory was to be prepared and sent immediately to ensure a thorough investigation. However, since this item of converted land was converted to grain transport from the 18th year, before the start of the levy in the 18th year, the grain register should have been created early, including the Bao Tu, the embankment number, the mu number, and the business household in the series of coupons. The missing coupons can be checked with the original grain register, and the collection office's general collection (etc.) ledgers and the township police's submission register can be clearly determined. Why create another inventory, causing delays and allowing those who colluded to make up for it at ease? It has been two months since this case was discovered. On what date did County Chief Jin say that the deadline was strictly limited, and until what date did it end? Why has it not been submitted or investigated? This is the first suspicious point. On August 9, County Chief Jin's Announcement No. 104 stated that in June of this year, it was discovered that the former director had collected the full amount of converted grain transport in the south of the Pu River, and that he had falsely reported the number of shi of converted grain transport in the north of the Pu River when reporting the number of shi to be reduced. However, the converted grain transport register of Dongju states that the converted grain transport in the south of the Pu River is 7,039 shi, 8 dou, 6 sheng, and 3 he, and the converted grain transport in the north of the Pu River is 3,260 shi, 6 dou, 4 sheng, and 9 he. The number of shi for converted grain transport in the north and south of the Pu River is very clear and has not been falsely reported. In September of the 22nd year, County Chief Jin and Finance Department Commissioner Shen Zhengshu jointly requested to reduce the converted grain transport by 40% in the 18th year. The original report stated that there were more than 10,000 shi of converted grain transport in the south of the Pu River, and that there had been no income since the 18th year. County Chief Jin's original report clearly does not match the grain register. Is it the confusion of County Chief Jin and the head of the responsible section, or is it the confusion of Director Ye? What kind of reasons were used for the discovery in June, and why is it still necessary to create a detailed register after two months, and to announce it on August 9? This is the second suspicious point. In short, the circumstances of this case are complex, the collusion is serious, and it involves many people. If they are not dealt with quickly and sent to the provincial law office, if it is delayed for a few weeks, they will buy back the coupons, forge ledgers, and destroy evidence, and it will be impossible to investigate. The department committee director and bureau chief have important duties and cannot remain silent. Therefore, I am responsible for reporting and have already submitted separate reports to Hall Director Zhou and Division Director Niu. I would also like to request that the head of the county government clarify the official administration and severely punish corruption, and suspend all the relevant officials of the county government and submit them to the local court in the location of the provincial government for thorough investigation and prosecution according to law. The overall situation is fortunate. Respectfully presented to Chen, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Songjiang.</p>

<p>The Qibao Police Station reported that three Hakka people claiming to be military officers used counterfeit money in the shops of Dong Yongxing, Delong, and Xiangyuan. When they were discovered, they had already left the town. Please inform the Xinzhuang Second Substation to intercept them. The police station sent a telegram to the Second Substation to send police to wait. Sure enough, at about 9:00 p.m., three people in military uniforms came slowly. They were immediately detained and questioned. They confessed that Lu De was from Xuzhou and impersonated an adjutant, Zhu Buting and Wang Yunxi. Counterfeit banknotes from the Four Ming Bank and flashlights were found. The Qibao merchants were brought to the case and identified them correctly. Because the case involved impersonating military officers and using counterfeit money, a document was prepared and sent to the bureau for review this morning (13th). Suzhou.</p>

<p>Causing a major disturbance. The Chenshe Town in the sixth district of the Xis district borders the Gushan Town in the fifth district of the Cheng district. At the western end of the town, there is a barren embankment that is about five zhang long and planted with trees. The project is strong. This embankment has always been a water conservancy guarantee for the surrounding farmland. This year, the weather is dry and the water is scarce. It also relies on the water from Changshu Shang Lake to flow westward. It depends on the embankment to stop the water and distribute it to the tributary rivers. The farmland is irrigated and the residents drink from the embankment. Recently, Wu Jize, the dismissed head of the Gushan Security Regiment, and Zhou Weisan, the town chief of Gushan Town, led a team of security regiment soldiers to Chenshe Town and demolished the embankment to build a wooden bridge, named Yongyu Bridge. Zhao Hongbin, the district chief of the sixth district of the Xis district, and Chen Zixiao, the town chief of Chenshe Town, learned that Wu and others should not demolish the embankment across the border, and immediately reported it to the county government and forwarded it to the Jiangyin County Government for investigation. They demolished the wooden bridge and rebuilt the embankment. Wu and others also presented separate reports to the Cheng and Xis counties, citing the convenience of transportation and irrigation of farmland, requesting that the embankment be demolished and the bridge built. The two county governments have now ordered the Construction Bureau to send personnel to conduct a joint survey with the district chiefs of the two districts to discuss a fair solution. Wu Jize and Zhou Weisan and others have led five or six hundred townspeople to prepare to demonstrate and petition during the joint survey.</p>

<p>Xicang Town in the Beixia Township of the Second District is a prosperous commercial market with a dense population. However, the foundation of the houses along the river on the lower bank of the town suddenly burst and sank more than four feet the night before, covering an area of more than one mu. Twenty-seven shops and houses from the Cai Family Charity Hall to the Sanji Bridge have all collapsed, with rubble all over the ground, causing considerable losses. Fortunately, the residents all fled, so there were no injuries. However, when a long bamboo pole is inserted into the holes where the soil burst, the depth cannot be measured. The danger is worrying, and there may be unexpected disasters. Business has been suspended as a result. Yesterday, Cai Hongjun and Cai Zixing, the township chiefs of the area, submitted a special report to the county government, requesting that personnel be sent to conduct an on-site survey, and forwarded to the Construction Department for review, and to provide relief and plan for the aftermath as soon as possible.</p>

The murderer escaped from the scene, and the county government issued a wanted order, but the case has not been solved. Yesterday, County Chief Yan learned from a secret report that one of the criminals in this case, Wang Jinkun, was hiding in the countryside. Please send police to arrest him as soon as possible. After receiving the report, County Chief Yan secretly ordered Wu Zhengrong, the chief of the political affairs police, to lead the police to the countryside to carry out the arrest. Wang was successfully arrested and immediately escorted to the city and sent to the county. The clerk Yu Quanqing held a court hearing and ordered him to be detained pending transfer to the local sub-court for trial. Yangzhou.</p>

<p>Xie Qin, a service member of the Jiangdu Public Security First Branch (stationed at the Caowang Market police station), and Liu Fang, a patrolman, caused public outrage for arbitrarily exercising their power. As a result, the city and the Zhu Family Township unanimously went on strike. Dozens of representatives from the eight townships of Zhongshan, Zhongyi, etc., including Zhou Jibu, came to Yangzhou on the 5th and went to the party and government agencies on the 6th to petition. Thirteen merchants, including Zhu Zhensheng, listed five charges against the service members and requested a thorough investigation. Subsequently, Gao Xinpan, the head of the district in charge, mediated, and Bao Yuan, the head of the first branch in charge, agreed to replace them. Unexpectedly, Xie Qin and others refused to accept the replacement and even surrounded the director of the first branch, saying that they would take extraordinary measures to deal with the replacement. Bao was forced to send armed guards to protect the service members and patrolmen on the 10th and return them to their posts in Caowang Market. They publicly set off firecrackers and shouted slogans such as "We will never live under the same sky as the township chiefs." Now, Ma Houan, the town chief of Zhongshan, Zhu Chengyao, the town chief of Zhongcheng, Si Ru, the town chief of Zhongyi, Ding Shisheng, the town chief of Zhulin, Zhu Ziyang, the town chief of Xingzhong, He Buqing, the town chief of Boai, Wang Wenbin, the town chief of Xieheng, and Yan Xinmu, the town chief of Labor, have jointly presented to the party headquarters, the county government, and the Fifth District Party Affairs instructor, the process of the armed forces being in love with the position, coercing the director, and disturbing the townships, requesting that the Public Security Bureau replace the police officers at the station and give Bao, the branch director, an appropriate punishment in order to maintain the safety and security of the townships and quell the public outrage of the merchants. On the public side, more than 30 representatives also came to the city on the 12th in the rain and went to the Fifth District Instructor's Office, the County Party Headquarters, the County Government, and the Public Security Bureau to petition, declaring that if they did not receive a satisfactory reply from the Public Security Bureau, they would gather at the Public Security Bureau and go on a hunger strike to await orders, and they must drive out all the public factories in the townships to secure the area. It is heard that if the representatives have no results, a large number of representatives will continue to come to the city to petition until they achieve their goal. Liyang.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, there has been no rain in this county, and traffic boats have been suspended for a month. The fields are cracked, the rivers are dry, and the barren landscape has become a reality. The autumn harvest is hopeless, and hundreds of thousands of farmers are in dire straits. Therefore, cases of farmers starving to death and committing suicide have been common in recent times. Some have even sold their sons and daughters to maintain their lives. Huang, a farmer in Nandu Town, used to be well-off, but his family has declined since the flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China. In addition, he has many daughters and many mouths to feed. This summer, he suddenly encountered a severe drought and was in extreme distress. At first, he pawned his household items to seek a full meal. Then, he gave up his children to maintain his remaining life. Finally, he could not find a way, and he hanged himself on the 8th. It is truly tragic. Haimen.</p>

<p>Deng Shaoxian (i.e., Deng Shaoyun), a soil seller in the Wu Gongxing Lane of the county and city, purchased a large batch of opium in Shanghai on the 8th of last month, worth more than 500 yuan, and transported it to Haimen.

After local newspapers learned and disclosed the case, County Chief Zhang read about it and found that the amount of opium presented by the squad was very different from the amount reported in the newspapers, and there was obviously something else going on. Yesterday, he ordered Xu Guoliang, the captain of the squad, to truthfully reply and sent personnel to investigate secretly for verification.</p>

<p>Wang Shengkang, 23 years old, from Henglin, Changzhou, had been unemployed for more than a year. The day before yesterday (8th), he went to Qidong Beixin Town to find a friend to seek a job. Unexpectedly, his friend had gone elsewhere and he did not meet him. So, he stayed at the Gao Jingou Inn in the town. The next morning, the innkeeper Gao Jingou saw that Wang's face was pale and his breathing was short. He knew something was wrong and asked him what was going on. According to him, because he did not meet his friend and failed to find a job, and because he had used up all his travel expenses, he swallowed opium and committed suicide. Gao urgently sought medical treatment, but the poisoning was too deep and could not be reversed. He died soon after. Gao Jingou reported it to the county government, which sent personnel to inspect the coffin and notify the corpse family to claim it. Nantong.</p>

<p>Unscrupulous merchants are profit-driven. A Central News Agency report from Xiamen states that rice prices have been rising recently, and various parties have been ordering foreign rice from foreign merchants. Although the customs authorities collect foreign rice taxes, the prices are still cheaper than those on the current domestic market. It is learned that rice and grains shipped from Xiamen, although only a few hundred bags each time, have been shipped to Shanghai repeatedly, and the number is quite considerable. It is reported that the rice and grains are not produced in Fujian, but are shipped from Taiwan, which belongs to Japan, to Xiamen, and then shipped to Shanghai. The reason for this transfer is that the Fujian Customs collects only half of the foreign rice tax standard set by the Ministry of Finance, while the Shanghai Customs collects the full amount. Therefore, unscrupulous merchants ship Taiwanese rice to Shanghai via Xiamen, passing it off as domestic rice to make huge profits. Cotton Industry Control Commission.</p>

Recently, in view of the lack of cotton planting talents in China, it has ordered the Central Cotton Production Improvement Institute to send students Hu Jingliang and Chen Lanshan to the United States to study various cotton planting subjects. It is reported that Hu Jingliang will study various cotton planting promotion subjects, while Chen will study various cotton planting breeding subjects. Hu and Chen will take the President Hoover wheel to the United States today. Hua silk prices are weak.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry sends personnel to investigate who have not yet arrived in Shanghai. There are only two double-cocoon silk factories in the city. According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the prices of Hua silk in the European and American markets, B-grade standard silk, have fallen to 400 yuan per package in Chinese currency, and there are no transactions, only market prices. Since the new cocoons were put on the market, a total of 33 silk factories in Shanghai have been勉强 maintaining operations. They are all of a temporary reeling nature. Now, because market prices remain weak, the reeled silk is bound to lose money. Therefore, the factories that have started operating stop and start intermittently. As of yesterday, fewer than 30 factories were in operation.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry has formulated measures to rescue the silk factory industry and has consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Government to allocate funds for rescue, but the municipal government has no funds to allocate and has replied to the Ministry of Industry. It is reported that Tan Xihong, director of the Agricultural Department of the Ministry of Industry, has been sent to Shanghai to investigate, but Xin Sheng News Agency reporters learned from Shen Huachen, a leader in the silk factory industry, yesterday that Director Tan of the Ministry of Industry has not yet arrived in Shanghai. The rumors that he has arrived in Shanghai are inaccurate.</p>

<p>In the spring of the 19th year of the Republic of China, there were a total of eight double-cocoon silk factories in Shanghai. Since the Shanghai War, only the Fulunheng Factory at the end of Tianbao Road in Hongkou has maintained operations. The silk it reels is sold to various places, such as India.

The Bank of China and the Shanghai Bank have loaned a total of more than 43 million yuan to the Shenxin Textile Corporation, which is operated by Rong Zongjing. Xin Sheng News Agency reporters learned from the banking and textile industries yesterday that in addition to the supervisory committee being attended by personnel from the two banks, further loans will be made to maintain the self-organization of Shenxin this time. However, it is stipulated that the loans will be for raw materials.

<h3 id="e126">Mr. Zhang Xiaomei's Opinion <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Seven Months of Silver Export Reaching 50 Million Yuan. According to Shen Shi News Agency, since the United States announced its silver nationalization plan, it has been making full use of silver, planning to issue silver certificates for circulation in the market. The government, in addition to taking in 200 million ounces under the nationalization order, still needs to purchase 130 million ounces of silver to meet the ratio of three-quarters gold to one-quarter silver. Since the announcement of this plan, countries using gold have felt a major threat and are devising countermeasures. Countries directly affected by the</p>
<p>International trade is still at a loss, not knowing what to do. The reporter of Shen Shi News Agency yesterday specially interviewed Dr. Zhang Xiaomei, director of the Economic Research Office of the Bank of China, to inquire about his views on this matter. According to Mr. Zhang's opinion, the United States' silver policy will cause China's silver reserves to decrease day by day, and it is difficult to be optimistic about the future. His remarks are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Silver Export <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>According to Dr. Zhang, since the past year, the inflationary faction in the United States has been advocating for higher silver prices and a lower US dollar value, which has already made it difficult for China to export goods, while cheap goods have been imported in large quantities to stimulate consumer society, resulting in an increasingly unbalanced import and export situation and creating a huge trade deficit. More silver is flowing out. Calculated over the seven months of this year, silver flowing abroad has reached as high as 50 million yuan. It is expected that this year's silver export will reach 100 million yuan. The total amount of silver in the country is estimated to be no more than 200 million yuan, most of which is concentrated in the nine major cities of Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin. The total amount stored in rural areas is extremely limited. Since silver is concentrated in cities, it is very easy to flow out of the country. As the amount of silver in the country decreases day by day, the price of securities and banknotes will inevitably plummet, the currency will contract, and industry and commerce will stagnate, ultimately leading to extreme panic.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Relief Measures <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Various experts have discussed many ways to deal with the US silver policy, which generally include: (A) levying export taxes, and (B) prohibiting silver exports. In China's treaty ports, most of the police power is in the hands of foreigners, and the coastline is so long that the suggestion in A is of little effect. China is originally a country with a trade deficit, and it must pay silver for purchasing foreign goods, so prohibiting silver exports is also practically impossible. According to my opinion, to deal with the US silver policy, efforts must be made in the following areas: (1) Purchase and use domestic goods. The purpose of the US silver policy is to increase prices and increase trade with China. If the Chinese people can see through their plan, they should automatically purchase and use domestic goods so that their plan cannot be realized. (2) Reduce debt. The total budget for the 23rd year of the Republic of China includes more than 25.7 million yuan in debt expenses, more than half of which is for foreign debt expenditure. This is an unavoidable fact of silver outflow and a leak in addition to the trade deficit. Even the returned portion of the Boxer Indemnity is still stipulated to be used for purchasing materials and goods from various countries, which is essentially no different from not returning it at all. Such treaties are restrictive and extremely erroneous; otherwise, a large portion of exports could also be reduced. Mr. Zhang continued, purchasing domestic goods and reducing debt are the only ways to deal with the US silver policy.</p>
<h3 id="e129">A Glimpse of Yesterday's Thunderstorm <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Heavy Rain in Slanting Sunlight - The City Center and Hongkou Are Soaked. This summer in the city has been unusually hot and dry. Since June 25th, except for a slight drop in temperature when the hurricane struck, almost every day has been around 100 degrees Fahrenheit, with the highest reaching 104.4 degrees, breaking the new record of 63 years since the establishment of the Xujiahui Observatory. After the Beginning of Autumn, everyone said that it could be hoped for coolness, but the sultry heat remained the same, lasting for fifty-one days. Yesterday afternoon around 2 o'clock, dark clouds gathered, thunder rumbled, and lightning flashed, as if a heavy rain was about to fall. Until 3:40 or so, the city center area began to experience strong winds and showers, lasting for about twenty minutes. Around 4 o'clock, the sunlight shone obliquely, and the rain became torrential. To the west of Jiangwan, near Fudan School, there was no rain at all, and the red earth and white dust flew in the air. However, south of North Sichuan Road and Hongkou Garden, there was a heavy downpour that stopped around 5 o'clock. As the saying goes, "Summer rain is separated by the edge of the field." Even though it is now autumn, it is still like summer, and it is unknown when it will finally be cool.</p>

<p>Raising One Million Yuan to Build Public Housing on a Large Scale - Improving Seawall Project Once and For All. Mayor Wu Tiecheng has recently planned to improve the lives of the city's poor and is actively proceeding with it. He plans to raise one million yuan to build public housing on a large scale in various districts of the city. In addition, he is also considering thorough methods for the city's east and west seawalls, planning a one-time and permanent project. This facility can be said to be a great contribution to the city's governance and future. A reporter from China East News visited Mr. Yu Hongjun, the secretary-general of the municipal government, yesterday to inquire in detail about the content of this plan. The details of each request are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e132">Ten Thousand Spacious Houses Shelter the City's Poor <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>According to Secretary-General Yu, Mayor Wu's plan to raise one million yuan to build public housing on a large scale is now actively underway. Mayor Wu's motivation for carrying out this matter stems from the fact that there are a large number of poor people in the city. These people live a miserable life, and their residences are mostly crude and unbearable, either a thatched shed or a broken boat (i.e., a shack boat). They are not enough to withstand strong winds and heavy rains, and when a fire breaks out, it is often difficult to handle. These poor people are extremely pitiful. The municipal authorities also believe that these buildings affect the city's appearance and hinder public safety, and they have repeatedly tried to find ways to ban them. However, banning them</p>

<p>Specifically Discussing Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the banks in the city previously, because of Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law promulgated by the Ministry of Finance (Savings banks should deposit at least one-fourth of the total amount of savings deposits in the form of government bonds, treasury bills, and other assets with reliable guarantees in a special vault established by the Central Bank as collateral for repaying savings deposits), and the provisions stipulating that the total amount of deposits should be based on the total balance at the end of each half-year, etc., the industry expressed compliance with the principles. As for the implementation methods, further research is still needed. Therefore, the Siming, Silk Industry, Guohua, Xinhua, and Jin City banks were elected to form a group meeting to discuss the methods. At noon yesterday, representatives from the five banks, Luo Qinghua, Chen Liting, Qu Jigang, Hu Xian, and Sun Ruihuang, and Lin Kanghou, secretary-general of the Banking Association, etc., had a meal at the Banking Club on Hong Kong Road and discussed the handling of Article 9 of the Savings Bank. It was generally believed that the items to be deposited in the Central Bank's vault according to the article were government bonds, treasury bills, and other assets, but the Ministry of Finance's instructions only mentioned government bonds, treasury bills, and did not mention other assets. Moreover, if the market price of government bonds and treasury bills is calculated according to the Ministry's order, the market price fluctuates from time to time, and the amount to be deposited must also increase or decrease accordingly. All kinds of doubts should be requested from the government for explanation and revision. It was decided that (1) the industry association should submit a report to the Ministry of Finance, (2) a meeting should be convened to discuss the draft of the report, and (3) another meeting should be held on the 15th of this month (Wednesday) to continue the discussion. Later, the resettlement methods for these poor people were not taken into account at first. Mayor Wu felt compassion for this and decided to raise one million yuan to build public housing on a large scale in the city's Huxi, Pudong, Nanshi, Zhabei, and other rural areas to accommodate these poor people, so that they have a place to live. Then, the shack boats and shantytowns that hinder the city's appearance and public safety will be banned, so that it will not affect the lives of the poor, and it will be easier to achieve practical results in improving the city.</p>

<p>However, this matter is of great importance and requires at least one million yuan. Given the municipal government's recent financial situation, it is really feeling overwhelmed. However, Mayor Wu believes that this matter must be carried out no matter what, so he is now actively organizing a preparatory committee. In order to gather wisdom from all sources, it has been decided to invite prominent Chinese and foreign figures in the city to serve as members of the committee. Therefore, the realization of this matter should not be far away. Regarding the funding, there are currently several methods: either consulting with commercial firms to borrow money, or cooperating with local banks. It is currently under consideration. The construction sites of the public housing will be determined based on local conditions. Attention should also be paid to transportation facilities and ensuring that it does not affect the original occupational life of the poor. As for the rent, it will be leased at a very low price in the future, so that the poor can afford it and meet the way of relief.</p>

<p>The city's seawall project is related to the lives, property, and well-being of all citizens. Every year during the autumn floods, dangerous situations often arise. Temporary funds are allocated for emergency relief. Although it is fortunate that no accidents have occurred, Mayor Wu believes that a permanent solution should be adopted for this matter. Although it will require a lot of money in the short term, after its completion, the city's citizens will be able to enjoy its benefits forever. However, since this project is huge and the plan for improvement cannot be accomplished in one word, Mayor Wu is still studying it in detail. However, this ambition will not change and will eventually be realized. Regarding the flood prevention work for this year's autumn floods, Mayor Wu has already allocated 200,000 yuan and ordered the Public Works Bureau to properly repair the east and west seawalls. This move was made before the last hurricane hit Shanghai, so this year's seawall in the city can be celebrated for its safety.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Paying Attention to Transportation, Mr. Wu Personally Inspects <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Secretary-General Yu also said that Mayor Wu has also been paying close attention to the city's transportation situation recently. Mr. Wu believes that the progress of transportation issues is closely related to the traffic police of the Public Security Bureau. Therefore, he recently ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to actively pay attention to the training of traffic police. In addition, Mayor Wu also personally inspects from time to time when he has some free time, and he does not hesitate to personally correct any inappropriate places.</p>

<p>In addition, Mayor Wu has also shown determination to ban drugs such as "Jing Wan" in the city. All offenders are strictly executed according to the regulations promulgated by the General Headquarters. He is even willing to give first-time offenders who smoke red pills a chance to reform. He has specially set up a drug rehabilitation center, and all first-time offenders who are detained for smoking red pills are sent to the center to break their addiction. The content and facilities of the center are very complete. Although it has only been established for a short time, it has already reached more than a thousand people. The expenses for this item are also funded by the municipal government, and the monthly expenses also reach thousands of yuan. China Merchants Bureau's New Ships Will Sail to China</p>

It was then forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for legal transfer and cancellation. Now, the Ministry's approval states: "The report is noted. Upon investigation, for ships that have already obtained nationality certificates from the Ministry of Communications, local governments may not collect license fees or ship taxes. It should be handled in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of the Provisional Regulations on Supervising Local Finance.

Therefore, the cholera in the Shanghai area can still be said to be calm. (2) The unusually hot and dry weather this summer was mentioned in the first announcement on July 13. It continued to be hot and dry until heavy rain fell between July 18 and 23. From that time until August 8, the weather was dry, and the temperature and humidity decreased slightly. On August 8, a hurricane blew in, the wind was not very strong, and at the same time, 2.36 inches of rain was obtained. (3) Among the three cases of mild cholera symptoms found, the first case was a servant woman, 36 years old, who lived in Nanshi. She fell ill on July 16 and was admitted to the Public Concession Industrial Bureau Isolation Hospital on the 19th. She was hospitalized for ten days. The disease was very mild and she recovered after saline injection. Her feces were tested twice and cholera vibrio was found. The second case was a male factory worker, 25 years old, who lived in the Public Concession. He fell ill on July 17 and was sent to the Shihhsiao Hospital the next day. His symptoms were also very mild and he recovered after treatment. The third case was a 24-year-old woman, unemployed, who lived in the French Concession. She went to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital for treatment on July 28. She did not stay in the hospital for long and left after being treated, and also recovered without saline injection. Cholera bacteria were found in the feces of all three patients. However, the diseases they contracted were not very serious. It is worth noting that none of the three people had been vaccinated against cholera. The origin of the infection is unknown. All three people drank tap water, not well water or river water. They had also not visited patients with the disease. Since July 28, there have been no further discoveries of cholera. (4) The epidemic hospitals established by the Industrial Bureau and philanthropists mentioned in the first announcement are all prepared to accommodate patients. However, although the weather this year has been very hot, it can still be called an extremely calm year. The number of inpatients and outpatients this year has decreased compared with previous years, and not only has cholera not been prevalent, but also other summer diseases (except for heatstroke) have been less than in previous years. According to the report of the medical director of the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, the hospital had about 400 outpatients a day last year, while this year there are only about 80 outpatients a day. (5) Public health agencies have not slackened in their epidemic prevention efforts. All tap water companies in the two concessions and the Chinese area provide free water to the poor as usual. The supply of this clean drinking water is the most important method for preventing cholera. In places where tap water plants are not convenient to set up, local authorities should dig artesian wells to protect the people. Dr. Hubble, Director of the Medical and Health Department of the Straits Settlements, said that when he was the Chief Medical Officer of Kedah Province, he discovered four major cholera epidemics between 1907 and 1914. Since the installation of tap water, this type of epidemic has not been discovered again. (6) Health propaganda is still being carried out as before. People from all walks of life should be vaccinated to protect themselves. As of the end of July, the number of people vaccinated against cholera is as follows: Shanghai City 160,000 people (approximately), Public Concession 57,165 people, French Concession 20,382 people, Railway Bureau 3,228 people, totaling 240,775 people. As of the end of June, 310,842 people. As of the end of July, 551,617 people. (7) The Epidemiology Group held its fourth meeting on August 10. In the reports received, the Shanghai Municipal Health Testing Institute tested 20 samples of suspected feces in July and 14 samples in August, all of which were negative for cholera. The Public Concession Health Department Testing Institute found cholera-like vibrio seven times, true cholera vibrio three times, and dysentery bacteria six times in 162 samples of suspected feces. (8) In order to determine the existence of true cholera vibrio or cholera-like vibrio, in addition to checking the water in rivers, wells, and ponds throughout the year, natural ice is also inspected to know if there are bacteria. However, the results obtained so far are all negative. (9) The Far Eastern Society of Tropical Medicine is scheduled to hold its ninth meeting in Nanjing from October 2 to 8. All tropical disease experts from various countries in the Far East, from India to Japan, are expected to attend the meeting. In addition to the various group meetings, a roundtable meeting will be specially opened for the cholera problem. Mr. Russell, Director of the Public Health Department of India, will be pushed as the chairman. He has rich experience in cholera during his tenure in Madras. It is hoped that in this discussion meeting, a deeper knowledge and stricter control methods can be obtained for this widespread epidemic in the East.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Requesting the Promulgation of Bankruptcy Law <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The National Association of Accountants submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "Upon investigation of the civil and commercial laws and regulations, since the establishment of our National Government, they have been promulgated successively and separately, and are generally considered complete. However, the bankruptcy law only has the draft bankruptcy law of the old Beijing government. Although it is clearly stated that it can be referred to, there is no current law that can be used as a standard. The reference and application are not binding, and it is easy to abuse by avoiding the important and taking the light. Accountants in various places are sometimes designated by the court as bankruptcy trustees, and they often suffer from the lack of a legal basis, making it difficult to handle the matter. The association is well aware of this actual situation, and hereby submits this document for review and consideration, and requests the Legislative Yuan to promulgate and implement the bankruptcy law as soon as possible so that there is a law to follow. Furthermore, Article 1 of the Accountants Regulations stipulates that accountants may act as bankruptcy trustees, because bankruptcy trusteeship involves accounting matters. It is also requested that the Ministry of Finance transfer the request to the Legislative Yuan, and that the position of bankruptcy trustee be clearly defined in the bankruptcy law as being held by accountants, so that accountants in various places can contribute to society."

<h3 id="e146">Anhui Province, Quanjiao Drought Relief Association Sends a Letter Seeking Relief <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>A fellow villager association was held at Guanshengyuan the day before yesterday to discuss the matter - it was decided to go to various charities today to petition for speedy relief. Shen Shi News Agency reports that the Anhui Province Quanjiao County Drought Relief Temporary Association sent personnel to Shanghai a few days ago, asking Jiang Xingsheng and other fellow villagers from the county in Shanghai to appeal to various charitable organizations for relief. According to the personnel, the county has an area of 5,500 square miles, and the disaster area has reached the entire county. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e147">The Disaster Situation is Severe with Hundreds of Miles of Barren Land <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>There was no rain or snow in the county last winter, and it has suffered from severe drought again this spring. The water stored in the fields and ponds is not enough to soak the seeds. Those who tried their best to plant less than three-tenths of the land. It was hoped that rain would make up for the planting, but since the summer, the drought has become more severe, with no rain at all. Most of the planted crops have withered, and the unplanted fields are cracked. The ponds and dams are dry and the rivers have stopped flowing, forming a rare disaster that has not occurred in 60 years, with hundreds of miles of barren land.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Selling Wives and Children, Starving People Everywhere <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The county has always been a poor area with few savings among the people. After the Xinwei flood disaster, the remaining survivors have not recovered their vitality. This spring, it has suffered from hail disasters again, and the harvest of wheat and barley has been sharply reduced. Now, it has suffered this drought disaster, and about 34,000 able-bodied men in the entire territory have been displaced. Ninety percent of the cattle have been slaughtered and eaten. The rural areas have collapsed, and ten out of ten houses are empty. Selling wives and children is often heard. Starving people are everywhere, and the tragic situation is beyond description. The residents cannot bear the remaining sufferings. Those who are pressed will risk danger and flee. Grain robbery has occurred in various villages, making it difficult to control. If relief is not sought urgently, the future of public security will be even more unbearable.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Elected Representatives to Appeal for Relief <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, all the fellow villagers from the county in Shanghai held a tea party at Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road to discuss the matter. In addition to the representative stating the previous situation, the climate of the county was also discussed. It was said that only buckwheat can be replanted when there is thorough rain before and after the Beginning of Autumn. Other crops are out of season. According to the investigation, disaster victims should be given relief grain and seed wheat, and large-scale emergency relief or king relief is especially needed to provide relief. Because the number of people waiting for relief is currently about 156,000, the meeting publicly elected three representatives to appeal to various charitable organizations in the port today, and plans to visit Xu Shiying, chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, to request relief. Pedestrian Safety Issues</p>
<h3 id="e150">Suggestions from the Nanjing Road Citizens' Association <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the pedestrian safety issue, the Nanjing Road Citizens' Association suggested to the Industrial Bureau Traffic Committee to limit the speed of cars and pay attention to the management of patrol officers. The original letter is as follows: "Reading the August 10th report, the council's discussion of pedestrian safety measures is well-considered, which shows that the committee members have done their best to protect pedestrians, and I am deeply grateful. However, according to the report of the police chief, most of the injured people are illiterate, and nine out of ten cross the road, which is true. However, how can these illiterate people understand the signs expressed by your bureau? There must be a definite method. According to the research of our association, the actual problem lies in the fact that your bureau does not pay attention to the arbitrary driving of car drivers. In prosperous areas and at key times, there is no absolute limit on the speed of cars. This is one of the biggest reasons. And the patrol officers' negligent management and failure to impose absolute enforcement on car drivers are also related. This is what your bureau and your association should pay attention to immediately." Dada Da Tong</p>
<h3 id="e151">Implementation of Joint Transportation Started Yesterday <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency from Yangzhou, which serves as the connecting point: The Datda Shipping Company operates three steamships on the Shanghai-Yangzhou route, namely Daqing, Dayu, and Dahe, each making a daily round trip between Shanghai and Yangzhou. To provide greater convenience for passengers and expedite the transport of goods, the company has partnered with the Datong Shipping Bureau, which operates between Huojiaqiao and Qingjiangpu, to launch joint transportation. Yangzhou serves as the connecting point. Both Datda and Datong are authorized to issue joint tickets. A ten-article contract has been agreed upon and signed in Shanghai on the 10th, and officially implemented starting yesterday. The Datong Shipping Bureau has specially prepared three shallow-draft, fast motorboats, along with towed barges, to depart daily from Huojiaqiao and Qingjiangpu, connecting with the Datda Shipping Company's ships. Passengers traveling from Shanghai to Shaobo, Gaoyou, Jieshou, Sishui, Pingqiao, Baoying, Huaicheng, Qingjiangpu, or from the aforementioned locations to Shanghai, can purchase joint tickets, and goods can also be shipped jointly. It is now changed to transport with small fast motorboats and barges. The navigation representative has submitted a petition.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Building a Public Charity Pier <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, a representative of the Western Shanghai shipowners in Pudong, yesterday submitted a document to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, stating: "We respectfully request consultation with the Bureau of Finance to promptly allocate funds according to the proposal for the construction of a public charity pier to facilitate commercial transportation. The Wanyu Public Charity, Yongsheng, Dongjiadu, and South Guild piers in the Nanshi area have long served as ports for ships traveling the routes from various towns and villages in counties such as Shangfeng and Nanchuan. They also serve as the busiest locations for loading and unloading goods for various businesses along the inner and outer roads of Nanshi, making it the commercial center of Nanshi. How can it be ignored? Since the sudden closure of the Wanyu Pier, the ships that used to dock there have had no reliable port. As a result, travelers from the countryside have scattered, and commercial activities have shifted. Fortunately, your bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau recognized this issue early on and stipulated the construction of a public charity pier south of the Wanyu Pier to meet the urgent needs of the citizens and benefit shipping. In October of last year, your bureau had already approved a plan for the construction of the public charity pier, with an estimated cost of over 20,000 silver dollars. However, due to the Bureau of Finance's exceptionally strained municipal treasury, funds must be allocated only upon receipt of land value tax, a decision that has been approved by the municipal government. We, the representatives, firmly request the preservation of all original port facilities and the construction of a public pier, solely to maintain the commercial center of Nanshi and prevent the collapse of the market. We are compelled to reiterate our request. We earnestly implore your honorable office to consider the actual situation, promptly consult with the Bureau of Finance, and immediately allocate funds according to the proposal to construct a public charity pier to appease the merchants and benefit shipping. We eagerly await your decision." North Station</p>
<h3 id="e153">Construction of a Railway Workers' Canteen Planned <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Two-Route Transportation Department, in order to address the issue of railway workers' meals, plans to first establish a public-friendly railway workers' canteen in a suitable location at the Shanghai North Station. Clean and hygienic Chinese meals will be provided at the lowest possible prices for workers from various departments, sections, and stations along the railway line to dine. The proposed plan is as follows: (1) Meal Variety: Each person per meal will be provided with one soup, one dish (vegetables, meat, etc.), several bowls of rice or several steamed buns (supplied according to appetite), and a large teapot with free boiled water. (2) Fee Standard: The temporary fee standard is set at one dime per person per meal. If possible in the future, it will be reduced further. (3) Internal Equipment: The canteen will have separate kitchen and dining areas. The kitchen will be equipped with long tables, long benches, iron stoves, refrigerators, water buckets, etc. Other necessary auxiliary equipment will be added as needed. (The construction cost of the canteen is estimated by Engineer Feng to be approximately 500 silver dollars.) Workers dining in the canteen must first pay the meal fee and receive a meal ticket from the cashier. They will then present the ticket to the cook to receive the meal, which they will take and eat at the dining tables provided. (4) Dining Utensils: All dining utensils, such as vegetable basins and rice bowls, will be uniformly purchased in enamel to ensure durability. (5) Employment of Workers: The canteen will employ one Chinese cuisine chef to specialize in cooking meals and two kitchen workers to handle tasks such as washing ingredients, utensils, and cleaning the dining area. (6) Cleanliness Inspection: The cleanliness management officer will be responsible for providing guidance. The bureau has approved a trial implementation and instructed the department to work with the general affairs and engineering departments to survey the vacant land west of the dry bridge north of the North Station as the canteen location. Once the engineering department completes the drawings for the building and equipment, bidding for construction can begin. Tiger Brand Eng Aun Tong</p>

The exterior resembles a large medicated oil box with a very large interior capacity. The company is known for its expertise in advertising and promotion. Last year, the tiger-shaped vehicle traveled throughout Zhejiang, the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway, and other areas, causing a sensation. Now, this new transport vehicle is even more attention-grabbing. It is said that this new vehicle is the latest model eight-cylinder Ford, with extreme speed, handled by Mr. Wang Rujia of Metung, and will be used to promote medicines on the five-province highways in the future.</p>

Chairman Xu Guqing presided over the meeting, reporting on the company's business status and income and expenditure for the year 1933. The meeting then discussed the 1933 net profit distribution plan, as well as amendments to the company's articles of association and business processing regulations, all of which were revised and approved in accordance with the law.

Shareholder Wang Mei-wu proposed that the original founders, such as Xu Guqing, Wang Caicheng, and Lü Yuequan, spared no effort in running around and calling for support when the company was founded in 1912. Lü, in particular, traveled extensively both north and south, enduring great hardships, which led to accumulated fatigue and illness, making his contributions especially significant. Employees such as Jing Qiankun and Yu Ci also made extraordinary contributions. The company's solid foundation and current success are the result of their collective hard work and perseverance. Rewarding virtue and merit is appropriate and should be encouraged. It was resolved to approve the principle of rewards, with the detailed measures to be decided by the board of directors. Next, directors and supervisors were re-elected in accordance with the articles of association. As a result, Wang Ziming, Jin Zongcheng, Du Yuesheng, Lü Rumin, Lü Yuequan, Song Ziliang, Sang Tieshan, Jing Qiankun, Xu Guqing, Wang Caicheng, Yang Gengguang, Gu Disan, Gu Qingyi, Wang Fangqi, and Wang Xiangyun were elected as directors; Lü Weiping, Wang Yuting, Shen Peiren, and Gao Xueguang were elected as alternate directors; Wei Shao-yi, Ding Rong, Zhang Danrong, Lu Wenshao, and Wang Hengjie were elected as supervisors; and Pan Zhiwen and Chen Zixin were elected as alternate supervisors.

The business is very prosperous. Mr. Guo, in view of the declining rural economy in various places, has been vigorously promoting animal husbandry, uniting capital to remedy the situation. He has contacted well-known farms and major milk companies in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, believing that the development of animal husbandry requires first and foremost the improvement of livestock breeds. Recently, a large number of dairy cows have been purchased from Australia on behalf of customers. Each cow is pregnant and about to give birth in China. Their performance is excellent, and the prices are fair, setting a record never seen before. The second batch of purchases is currently underway, and many places have heard the news and are enthusiastically placing orders.</p>

As a result, it is difficult for him to fully focus on the affairs of the Samsung Factory. Mr. Jiang Zhonghe is an executive member of the Shanghai National Goods Factories Joint Association and also serves as the coordinator of the China National Cotton Fabric Market. His experience and qualifications are both rich and extensive. He has recently been working hard to expand the business and make contributions to the national goods industry.</p>

Greatly surprised, he urgently reported to the receptionist, who managed to open the door and enter the room. They found Li lying on the bed, pale and lifeless, with foam constantly flowing from his mouth. A small amount of Lysol water was left on the table, indicating he had taken poison. They urgently reported to the police station, who dispatched detectives to the scene. They transported him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but his condition was critical. The reason for his suicide is still unclear. However, a suicide note was found, addressed to the hotel receptionist, stating, "I am very sorry for committing suicide here. I hope that after my death, you will notify the Pushan Villa to collect and bury my body." The note did not mention the reasons for his suicide. Knife Stabbing and Gunshot Wound</p>
<h3 id="e160">Shao Tansheng's Injuries Are Not Fatal <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>A new shirt was robbed. Rumors of smuggling contraband. Shao Tansheng, 29 years old, from Huangdu, has recently been residing in the clubhouse at the intersection of Hobilan Road and Lincoln Road in Western Shanghai. Around 9:00 PM the night before last, he took a car from Shanghai to Zhoujiaqiao and switched to a rickshaw pulled by Wang Xiaofan to return to the clubhouse. When the rickshaw reached the vicinity of Chenjiadu Xizhenliu Villa, two robbers dressed in black suddenly appeared, one wielding a bayonet and the other holding a pistol. They stopped the rickshaw to rob him. Shao immediately shouted for help. One robber then slashed him in the back of the head with the bayonet. Shao continued to shout, and the other robber fired a shot at his leg. The two robbers then grabbed a new shirt from his hand and fled. The police chief of the 6th District Police Station of Chenjiadu heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, but were unable to apprehend the robbers. They immediately transported Shao to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. The police officers of the police station subsequently arrested a suspect named Miao Tairan and sent him to the 6th District. During interrogation by the district officer, Miao claimed to be from Shandong and working in the Yipin Factory in Zhoujiaqiao. He firmly denied the robbery. Subsequently, District Chief Tan ordered the leader of the investigation team, Wu Kezhong, to summon rickshaw puller Wang Xiaofan to the district office. A bullet casing was found in the rickshaw. Wang identified Miao Tairan as the robber. Leader Wu then went to the hospital to question Shao. Shao's injuries were not life-threatening and doctors were trying to remove the bullet. It is rumored that Shao was smuggling contraband, which led to him being targeted by the robbers. After the Toxicity Passed</p>

<p>Suicide After Husband Ignores Advice. Starts making noise as the body is examined. Guomin News Agency reports that Wang Yu, a young woman residing at 46 Qichang Stockade in Pudong, had repeatedly and strictly advised her husband, Wang Xiansong, to quit his opium habit. The day before yesterday, Wang went to the home of Zhang Ni, a young woman from the same village, to indulge in opium again. When his wife, Wang Yu, found out, she was filled with anger and went to Zhang Ni's house. She found her husband and Zhang Ni lying in bed, smoking opium together. Wang Yu scolded Zhang Ni severely. Zhang Ni refused to show weakness, leading to a conflict. Wang Yu dragged Zhang Ni to the 3rd District Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. District Chief Zhang Mingqin summoned both parties to the station for questioning. The result of the interrogation was that the case involved mutual assault, and both parties were fined three dollars each and released. After being fined, Wang returned home dejectedly. Yesterday morning, around 8:00 AM, she secretly swallowed opium in an attempt to commit suicide. Her husband discovered her and transported her to Pudong Hospital for emergency treatment. The treatment was ineffective, and she died at 1:20 PM the day before yesterday. Wang believed that his wife was insulted and died out of resentment, so he reported the information to District Chief Zhang for filing. He also carried Wang Yu's body to Zhang Ni's house to negotiate, which led to another quarrel. In addition to reporting to the General Bureau through District Chief Zhang, he also ordered the local guard to cross the river to the local court to request an examination of the body. Subsequently, the district called the Supervision Office and reported that the deceased Wang Yu had made gurgling sounds from her mouth and had resurrected. Therefore, the death form for Wang Yu that had been previously filed should be canceled and invalidated. It is truly a miracle. Chen Asan's Robbery</p>

<p>Victims Testify in Court. Chen Asan Completely Denies Allegations. On the 4th of this month, at 11:20 AM, Bao Shuji, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, arrested Chen Asan (also known as Big Bowl Wang Xiaodi) from Jiangbei at the intersection of Tangshan Road and Dengtal Road. A Unique brand pistol and five bullets were confiscated. He was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. He claimed that the pistol was not his. All the details have been reported in this newspaper. He was ordered to be remanded in custody for further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie-fen presided over the Third Criminal Court. Iu Bao-yi, a lawyer from the Public Works Bureau, stated that during the extended investigation, it was discovered that the defendant, along with Zhang Xuecheng, Huan Zhixiang, and three others who had already been arrested and sentenced to imprisonment, had committed eight armed robberies between April 23rd of last year and June 2nd of this year.

The value of the stolen goods was over 700 silver dollars. The shop owners identified the defendant at the police station as holding a pistol and threatening them during the robberies. The three accomplices, Zhang Xuecheng and others, have been sentenced in the first trial and have appealed. If they propose to identify the defendant, they may not do so. The shop owners are present in court and request to be questioned. Yang Xingsheng, Zhong Shunda, and others testified to the robbery. They confirmed that the defendant was present at the scene, holding a pistol and ordering them not to make a sound, and that he took the goods. When questioned, the defendant completely denied the allegations. Lawyer Ru said that the defendant had rented a room at Zhu Shunxing on Edward Road for a month to plan the robberies. The hotel tea boy is present in court to identify the defendant. The tea boy, Chen Ruisheng, testified that the defendant rented a room at the time with many friends, who called him Wang Xiaodi.

<p>Ren Tangshi Smoke… Drowned… Sudden Illness. Ren Tangshi, the wife of Ren Qigui, a migrant residing at the Ren family wooden bridge in Zhabei, had a quarrel with her husband the day before yesterday due to a dispute over beating a child. Tangshi felt that she had been wronged and that life was worse than death, so she secretly committed suicide by smoking opium the night before last. When her family discovered her, it was too late to save her. Yesterday, the local guard, Li Er, reported the matter to the local court for an examination. Xu Xu, the wife of Xu Baoxiang, a Cantonese residing in the Dongshou Xujiajiao area of Pengpu Township, was 30 years old and had a history of mental illness that recurred from time to time. The day before yesterday, the old illness recurred, and she ran to a nearby small river and drowned. Yesterday, the local guard reported the matter to the court for an examination. Xu Haixi, a sixteen-year-old apprentice, Xu Haixi, from Taixing, lived in a shed at 40 Changsheng Street inside the Lao Beimen with Wang Liangzhi, who set up a cobbler's stall. The day before yesterday, Xu Haixi suddenly died of illness. Wang Liangzhi was afraid of future complications because the deceased's family members were all in his hometown, so he reported the situation to the local police station yesterday, ordering Jiang Pingyang, the local head of the nine shops, to report to the court for an examination. In all three cases above, Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia, accompanied by Examiners Xuan Zhiming, conducted separate examinations and ordered the bodies to be placed in coffins pending further instructions.</p>

<p>Inferior Hat Blanks Replace Sample Goods</p>
<h3 id="e169">Bei Xuehai Deceives American Merchants <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Shortages Discovered After Opening the Boxes. Six American Manufacturers Were Deceived. The Reputation of Chinese Merchants Ruined by Bei Alone. Bei Xuehai, a native of Ningbo, previously operated the Baoyu Import and Export Firm in this city. He sold straw hat blanks to companies such as the Blumberg Company in New York, USA. However, after the goods arrived in New York, the buyers, together with local customs officials, opened the boxes for inspection and discovered that the goods inside were of much inferior quality compared to the samples. Furthermore, the number of items in each box was supposed to be 600, but only 300 were found. Therefore, the buyers believed that Baoyu had engaged in deceptive behavior and sent a telegram to Shanghai in January of this year to investigate. Bei Xuehai, seeing that his deception had been exposed, closed down the store and fled without a trace. It was not until May that Detective Feng Zhiming discovered that Bei was hiding in Fangbang Road in the city. He, together with the Public Security Bureau, rushed to arrest him and handed him over to the First Special District Local Court, which ordered the defendant to post bail pending further investigation. It is now learned that since November of last year, Bei has defrauded companies in New York out of a total of: $12,175.18 to the Openshaw Textile Company, $5,497.28 to the Hentze &amp; Heymann, $8,321.17 to the Towro Lawson Brown, $5,086.88 to the A. Armitage, $13,128.38 to the Gemi, and $5,058.82 and $24,316.48 to the Blumberg Company in two separate incidents. The defrauded companies in New York have sent the samples and goods to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, the police escorted Bei Xuehai to the court, where Judge Huang Risheng opened the trial. Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu briefly described the case and presented the hat blanks of obviously superior and inferior quality as evidence. However, there are as many as six defrauded companies, and the court needs to investigate each one individually, which will take a considerable amount of time. Therefore, after questioning until 4:00 PM, the court ordered that the trial be adjourned to a later date.</p>

<p>Citizens Please Avoid Greed for Coolness Daily News Agency reports that at the time when true cholera was discovered in this city, dysentery was also discovered, but the situation was generally mild. Yesterday, a visit to the Red Cross Society's Epidemic Hospital on Tibet Road revealed that a large number of dysentery cases had suddenly been discovered in this city over the past week. At that time, more than 30 people went to the hospital for treatment every day. After five or six days, the number had decreased to about four or five people going to the hospital for treatment every day. The hospital is very careful in treating dysentery. However, statistics show that about three or four percent of the treated people died. The reason for the outbreak is that the weather is out of balance, and the weather is hot and cold. People who are greedy for coolness at night and drink unsanitary cold food are most susceptible to illness. The main cause of dysentery is excessive congestion. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will pay attention to this.</p>

<p>A German, enraged that his wife was living with an Englishman, first shot and killed the two, then shot himself to death. A German named Weisel, a metal craftsman with a shop on Nanjing Road, had married a Korean woman. Recently, Weisel, troubled by both family and business problems, had considered divorcing his wife, but according to German law, his wife had to reside in Germany first. However, Weisel's wife had recently become fond of a Scotsman named Britton, and the two had even set up a separate company to compete with Weisel's business. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Weisel went to the apartment of his wife and Britton on the upper floor of the Bie Fa branch store at No. 1181 Jing'an Temple Road, first shot and killed his wife and Britton, then shot himself to death. The police are currently conducting a thorough investigation and have not yet ascertained the truth. It is reported that Weisel, in financial straits two years ago, had won the top prize in the International Savings Society lottery, receiving a prize of 25,000 yuan, and later entrusted 10,000 yuan to his wife for storage. The main cause of this case is undoubtedly family honor and business competition. A Thug Causes Trouble in a Teahouse</p>
<h3 id="e174">Detailed Account of Shooting Leading to Death <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>"Little Pockmark" is the source of the trouble. Police have arrested two criminals. The Nanyang Teahouse at the intersection of Guangxi Road and Beihai Road was the scene of a thug's failed extortion attempt on gangsters around 8:00 PM the night before. The gangsters, in desperation, opened fire, resulting in six casualties among passersby. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that after the Public Concession Police, together with the French Concession Police, conducted a thorough investigation overnight, they arrested two suspects and learned the cause of the incident. A notorious gangster known as "Little Pockmark," who is being actively pursued by the police authorities, was walking along Beihai Road the night before, wearing a black silk shirt and pants. He was spotted by Gu Yonggui, a Shanghainese white-collar worker, 24 years old, residing at No. 44 Peikai'er Road; Shi Afa, a 22-year-old Ningbo native, residing at No. 5 Taiyuan Lane, Xizilaifeng Street; Wang Yurong, a 26-year-old Shaoxing native, residing at No. 11 Yushun Lane, Yunnan Road; and Ying Ronglin, a Tongzhou native residing at No. 65 Guangxi Road, who thought they saw an opportunity. They immediately stopped Little Pockmark, forced him into the Nanyang Teahouse for tea, and demanded 30 yuan as a hush money, threatening to report him to the police otherwise. Little Pockmark, a wanted criminal, knew that publicity would be detrimental to him, so he pretended to agree, falsely claiming that he did not have enough money and needed to consult with his accomplices downstairs. After speaking, he got up and went downstairs. Gu Yonggui and the other four believed him and followed him downstairs. Unexpectedly, Little Pockmark, after going downstairs, immediately rushed out the door, hoping to escape. Therefore, Gu Yonggui and the others hurriedly chased after him. During the chase, Gu's straw hat was blown off and fell to the ground. He bent down to pick it up. Little Pockmark, seeing this, suspected he had other intentions, quickly pulled out his hidden pistol and fired a shot at Gu and the others, then fled towards Guangxi Road. Gu and the others, seeing that they had not been hit, fearing he would escape, frantically blew whistles for help. Thereupon, nearby beat police gathered, seized guns, and joined the chase. Little Pockmark, seeing the situation, knew it would be difficult to escape, so he turned around and fired at the police. The beat police also returned fire, and the two sides engaged in a brief shootout on Guangxi Road. Neither side hit anyone, but three passersby, Zhang Zhong, a 30-year-old Yangzhou native; Xu Shengquan, a 15-year-old Suzhou native; and Qian Chenglun, a 38-year-old Changzhou native, were all wounded by stray bullets and fell to the side of the road. At this time, Little Pockmark had crossed Guangxi Road, reached Avenue Edward VII, and fled along the south side of the sidewalk towards the Bund. The Chinese police continued to pursue him relentlessly. When he reached Zhengjia Wooden Bridge Street, he turned into Baoyu Lane and escaped into the Public Concession via the lane and East New Bridge Street. Public Concession police officer No. 717, seeing this, stepped forward to arrest him, but Little Pockmark threatened him with his gun. The Public Concession officer, unable to draw his gun in time, had to let go and rejoined the Chinese police of the Public Concession in a tight pursuit. At this time, Little Pockmark had crossed Avenue Edward VII and reached Zhejiang Road. Suddenly, whistles sounded densely, as if a major incident had occurred. Little Pockmark, in a state of panic, turned around again and fought with the police. As a result, gunfire resumed, as dense as raindrops, with bullets flying everywhere. Passersby scrambled to avoid the bullets. Little Pockmark fought and fled, taking advantage of the chaotic situation to escape into Songjiang Lane and disappear without a trace. His pistol was also abandoned in the lane. However, three more people were injured by stray bullets at the time. Among them, Teng Baiqing, a 15-year-old mechanical apprentice from Wuxi, died after being shot in the head. Jia Lushan, 25 years old, from Zhenjiang, and Yang Shansheng, 46 years old, from Zhejiang, were also seriously injured and were taken to the hospital by police car for treatment. The pistol was taken back to the police station for filing. Meanwhile, the French Concession Police joined forces to conduct a thorough search day and night. It was not until yesterday morning that the whereabouts of Gu and the others were discovered. Detectives were dispatched in various directions to arrest them. However, Wang Yurong and Ying Ronglin had already been alerted and had fled, so only Gu Yonggui and Shi Afa were captured. They were immediately taken back to the Zhabei Police Station for temporary detention, pending the arrest of their accomplices and Little Pockmark for joint investigation.

<p>Zhang Atang boldly smuggled them into prison. Wang Bogang discovered the secret during inspection. Zhang Atang, a 52-year-old peddler from Pudong, residing at No. 85 Wu Songjiang Road, south of the Guoen Temple in the French Concession, visited the female prisoner Chen Asi at the Jiangsu Second Special District Prison on Avenue Edward VII at 4:00 PM on the 11th of this month. He handed over the items he brought to the female prisoner. During the inspection by the guard supervisor Wang Bogang, he noticed that both items had been tampered with. Upon detailed inspection, he found that the soap was hollowed out inside, storing several coins worth of opium dregs, and the Tangmian dumplings contained dozens of red pills. Zhang was immediately charged with violating prison regulations, and Zhang and the items were detained. The incident was reported to the French Concession Police, who dispatched detectives to take Zhang and the evidence to the police station. Under investigation, Zhang was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday, where Judge Wu Fanglian conducted the interrogation. The police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the case, prosecuting Zhang under Article 13 of the Opium Suppression Law. A representative from the Second Special District Prison was also present to testify about the incident. When questioned, the defendant Zhang Atang confessed that an unknown old woman entrusted him to deliver the items to the prison, and he did not know that they contained contraband. He pleaded for leniency. The court reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody, pending further investigation and review. A Garage at No. 6 Avenue Joffre</p>

<p>The deceased, Zhang Yinshi, had no biological children. She had only one daughter named Jinbao, who is 26 years old this year. Her former husband had passed away, and she lived separately from her mother, residing on the third floor of the Wanhua Spring Hotel at No. 167 Parker Road in the Public Concession. Because the deceased had no son, she adopted a man from Anhui named Huang Tianxiang (27 years old) as her son, and he lived with the deceased in Zhen'an Lane, Zhabei. Huang was fond of gambling, and his daily expenses were provided by Jinbao, who sent one silver dollar every three days for the deceased and Wang to live on.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Discovery of the Body <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, Jinbao again went from the Concession to Zhabei to deliver a silver dollar for living expenses. When she entered the door, she saw Huang Tianxiang at the door and immediately asked if her mother was at home. Huang replied that she had gone to your house to get money. Jinbao believed him and returned to her home on Parker Road. After arriving home, she asked her roommates, who all said that her mother had not come. So, around 3:00 PM, Jinbao took another silver dollar and went to Zhabei. Huang was no longer at home. When she entered the kitchen, she saw that the utensils were in disarray and smelled of blood. Suspecting something was wrong, she found a body under the iron bed, lying face down in a pool of blood. Jinbao, upon seeing this, knew that her mother had been murdered and could not help but weep loudly over the body.</p>

Jinbao and the subtenant Ni Fanshi, along with roommates Zhang Chenshi and Zhang Dongshi, were taken to the station. Jinbao testified that her mother, Zhang Yinshi, had an adopted son named Huang Tianxiang, who had previously wanted her to become his wife. Her mother refused, saying that since he had already been adopted as a son, he could not become a son-in-law. Unexpectedly, when I went to deliver money today, she had been murdered, etc. Ni Fanshi, Zhang Chenshi, and Zhang Dongshi all testified that they had seen the deceased go out to fetch water around 8:00 AM today (i.e., the day before yesterday) and had not seen her since.

<p>The Prosecutor Orders the Police to Apprehend the Escort. At 11:00 PM the night before last, an unnamed woman, about 35 or 36 years old, suffering from cholera, was assisted by a man in hiring a rickshaw pulled by Chen Zhonglu, a Taizhou native, at the junction of Zhaojiabang Road and Xianqiao Road in the Chinese Territory, to go to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Fourth Tibet Road for treatment. However, when they arrived at the hospital, the woman was barely breathing and her condition was beyond saving. The hospital refused to admit her, and they returned in the same rickshaw. After traveling only a few steps, the man escorting her told the rickshaw puller to go and exchange copper coins and instructed the puller to go ahead. The rickshaw puller pulled the rickshaw to the front of the Great World, where the woman had stopped breathing and died in the rickshaw. Patrolman No. 338 discovered this, stopped him for questioning. The puller looked back and shouted, but the man escorting her had taken the opportunity to flee and could not be found. The patrolman reported this to the police station, who took the body in the rickshaw to the Tongren Fuyuan Mortuary for an autopsy. Meanwhile, detectives were dispatched to investigate and found that the deceased had no family. Yesterday morning, a request was made to the Second Special District Court to appoint Prosecutor Wang Ren to go to the mortuary with a forensic doctor and clerk to conduct an autopsy.

<p>Carefully Select Exquisite Products and Take the Opportunity to Expand Abroad. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously received a report from the Consul General in Singapore, stating that local overseas Chinese were launching a National Products Exhibition at the Great World Amusement Park on National Day, October 10th, to promote the psychology of overseas Chinese using national products. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs forwarded the report to the Ministry of Industry for review. Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, having returned from an industrial inspection in Nanyang, is planning to promote national products to overseas Chinese in Nanyang to encourage their use. The fact that overseas Chinese are holding a National Products Exhibition at the Great World Amusement Park is a unique opportunity to promote and expand national products abroad. Yesterday, he instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, the Association of National Product Factories, and other organizations to gather national product manufacturers and carefully select exquisite products to be shipped to Nanyang for participation.

<p>The victim, Tan, Dies from Injuries Sustained in a Beating. Tan's Spleen Was Five Times Larger Than Normal. Tan Xin Attempted to Rape a Young Girl Twice. Tan Xin, a 25-year-old carpenter from Guangdong, rented a room on the front floor of No. 628 North Sichuan Road. He was not yet married. Yu Liang, a widow from the same hometown, lived in the kitchen and sold curry beef soup in the alley to make a living. She had a daughter named Yikai, who was only thirteen years old and had decent looks. She was accustomed to getting up alone every morning to buy beef and other ingredients. One morning five or six days ago, Tan saw that Yu had gone out and the girl had not yet gotten up. He had a bad idea and went to her room, rushed to her bedside, forcibly took off her clothes, and caressed her body, intending to commit rape. Fortunately, the girl shouted loudly, and he did not succeed. The day before yesterday morning, Tan planned to commit the same beast</p>
<h3 id="e191">Tongshang Bank Sues Dai Zhenwu for Debt Case <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Full Text of the Japanese Consulate Judgment: Dai Loses and Provisional Execution Granted. Because Dai Zhenwu ignored the debt to Tongshang Bank, it led to the bank's chairman, Chuan Xiao'an, accusing lawyer Yan Dajue of conspiracy to intimidate. The Shanghai First Special District Court has scheduled a further hearing on the 7th. Regarding Dai Zhenwu's ignoring the debt, the Japanese Consulate has announced its judgment. The litigation costs are to be borne by the defendant, and provisional execution is granted. The judgment is recorded as follows: Judgment of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai: Plaintiff: China Tongshang Bank, No. 7 Huangpu Bund, Shanghai, Legal Representative: Zhu Zikui, Litigation Agent: Lawyer Takada Ichiro. Defendant: Dai Zhenwu, No. 223 North Xizang Road, Shanghai, Litigation Agent: Lawyer Yano Nobuyuki. Between the above parties, regarding the loan recovery case No. 55 of the 9th year of Showa (1934), this Consulate General judges as follows: Main Text: The defendant shall repay the plaintiff principal of silver 73,000 taels and interest, of which (1) 50,000 taels, from January 25, Showa 8 (1933) until the date of repayment, at a monthly interest rate of 5%; (2) the remaining 23,000 taels, from January 25, Showa 8 (1933) until the date of repayment, at a monthly interest rate of 9%, compounded every three months. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant. This judgment is subject to provisional execution. Facts: The plaintiff's agent requests a judgment as per items 1 and 2 of the main text, and requests a declaration of provisional execution. The statement briefly states that the plaintiff lent the defendant (A) 50,000 taels of silver on January 25, Showa 8 (1933), with a repayment date of six months, at a monthly interest rate of 9%; (B) 8,000 taels of silver; and (C) 15,000 taels of silver, all due for repayment on January 25, Showa 9 (1934), with a monthly interest rate of 9%, compounded every three months, with interest added to the principal. If the repayment is still not possible after the deadline, the amount of damages incurred according to the agreed interest rate will also be added to the principal silver every three months. Because the deadline has long passed and the defendant has not paid, this lawsuit is filed to demand repayment of the principal silver, agreed interest rate, and damages, etc., and the original document No. 1 (Dai's IOU) is presented as proof. Witness Zhu Huanwen is also requested for questioning. The witness claimed ignorance of document No. 1 of Yi (乙). The defendant's litigation agent requests the dismissal of the plaintiff's lawsuit and denies the fact asserted by the plaintiff regarding the loan of 50,000 taels. As for other facts, it is partially admitted, and it is argued that in September of Showa 6 (1931), Wang Xinguan, the manager of the plaintiff bank, had obtained the defendant's consent to borrow 50,000 taels of silver from the plaintiff in the defendant's name. However, there was no transfer of money between the two parties, so the contract cannot be established. Even if it is assumed to be established, Wang Xinguan was acting as an agent for both the plaintiff and the defendant when concluding the contract. This procedure violates Article 108 of the Civil Code and should be deemed invalid, etc., and document No. 1 of Yi (乙) is presented as proof. The defendant himself is also requested for questioning. The defendant fully admits the establishment of document No. 1 of Jia (甲). Reasons: The plaintiff lent the defendant 8,000 taels and 15,000 taels of silver on January 25, Showa 8 (1933), both with January 25, Showa 9 (1934) as the repayment date, at a monthly interest rate of 9%, compounded every three months, with interest added to the principal. The fact that after the repayment deadline, the damage amount according to the agreed interest rate is also added to the principal every three months has been admitted by the defendant and is therefore an undisputed fact. Regarding the plaintiff lending the defendant 50,000 taels of silver on January 25, Showa 8 (1933), with a monthly interest rate of 9%, and repayment of principal and interest after six months, combining document No. 1 of Jia (甲) (i.e., Dai's IOU) and the testimony of witness Zhu Huanzhi, this consulate finds the reasons for its establishment to be sufficient and without doubt. All documents No. 1 of Yi (乙) submitted by the defendant and the defendant's own statements are insufficient to influence the above finding. Therefore, this consulate considers the plaintiff's claim in this case based on the above facts to be entirely legitimate. Regarding the bearing of litigation costs, Article 89 of the Civil Procedure Law applies, and regarding the declaration of provisional execution, Article 196 of the same law applies. The judgment is as stated in the main text. Consul of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai: Shimokawa Kuichi. Right Original Copy Without Error. July 30, Showa 9 (1934).

<p>Our party, with the Three Principles of the People as the national revolution, strives for the equality of the nation's political and economic status. For decades, we have never slacked off. Until the Northern Expedition in the 15th year of the Republic (1926), and then the establishment of the capital in Nanjing and the recovery of North China, the achievements were unexpected in less than two years. This is indeed because the doctrine of our party is sufficient to call on the masses, and the close cooperation of comrades and compatriots has enabled this great revolutionary cause to make considerable progress, and its achievements are also worthy of praise. Unfortunately, domestic rebels have risen repeatedly, and bandits and communists have been rampant. Natural disasters and man-made disasters have come one after another. When Japan took advantage of our suicidal situation, it seized our Northeast, invaded our Shanghai, seized our Rehe, and threatened our Pingjin. The party and the country are in danger of being toppled, and the nation has the pain of a gossamer thread. Our central government has handled it with caution, and Chairman Chiang has made various plans, so that the nation and the country can fortunately have a chance to rest and recuperate temporarily. However, the difficulty of our party's situation and the weight of responsibility will also increase day by day. Why? In terms of domestic politics, the realization of the Three Principles of the People must be based on whether the nation's political and economic status has been equalized. Therefore, the abolition of unequal treaties will make the nation-state tend towards prosperity and development to realize the principle of nationalism. The work of promoting local autonomy will enable the people to exercise political power and balance it with the government's governance power to realize the principle of democracy. The vigorous implementation of equal land rights and the control of capital will enable the people's livelihood problems to be universally resolved to realize the principle of people's livelihood. All these are necessary tasks in the revolutionary process. However, how much of these has our party started and how much has it completed? Thinking of this makes people sweat without being hot and shiver without being cold. Can all our comrades not realize the importance of their responsibilities and think of ways to serve themselves? Furthermore, let us try to talk about international politics. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has despised international justice, destroyed the integrity of our national territory, and used all means to seize and plunder. The equilibrium situation in the Pacific has been broken by Japan's iron fist. In Europe, Germany and France are at odds, Italy and France are opposed, Germany and Russia are at odds, Britain and France are in conflict, and Britain, the United States, France, and Italy are vying for hegemony. The current situation in the Balkans has also returned to before 1914. The failure of the disarmament conference and the panic of the world economy have further increased the crisis. At this time, China, located in a sub-colony, has only two paths in front of it: one is to be slaughtered by imperialism and tend towards destruction, and the other is to work hard and strive for the revival of the nation. Where to go and what to do is up to our party to decide under China's current party-rule system. All responsibilities are borne by our party. Can our comrades not work hard? As described above, the responsibility of our party cannot be said to be insignificant. Therefore, our party considers the quantity and quality of party members, and is deeply worried that it will be insufficient to cope with national disasters and complete the revolution. The total population of the country is 470 million, and there are only more than 1.1 million party members, which is less than one-four-hundredth of the national population. Even in this city, with a population of 3 million, there are only more than 10,000 party members, accounting for about one-three-hundredth of the city's population. With this small number of party members leading the unorganized masses to complete such a large mission, even if everyone has three heads and six arms, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve success. The truth is clear, and there is no need to avoid it. Moreover, (metabolism) allows all things to thrive. This law can also be applied to the organization of the party. If we listen to the gradual elimination of old members without new members to supplement them, then decades later, the party will not be a party, let alone a career, let alone a revolution. Our party deeply knows the necessity of absorbing new party members, and also knows that there are many outstanding elements outside the party who believe in the doctrine and are enthusiastic about the revolution, waiting for our party to accept them. Therefore, it is stipulated that 30,000 party members should be recruited in Shanghai, and this association will be responsible for it. It is also stipulated that each comrade must be responsible for introducing three new party members before September of this year to meet the predetermined number of 30,000 people. It is hoped that our comrades will find outstanding elements in their careers, social circles, groups, institutions, families, and relatives and friends, and sincerely invite them to join our party. With our comrades' usual loyalty and courage to the party, this work, which is of great importance and does not require much labor, will surely be completed quickly within the predetermined period. There is hope. Furthermore, this association also wants to inform our compatriots that human beings are political animals, and politics is the management of the affairs of the public. Since human beings cannot separate themselves from politics, human beings cannot but study politics, pay attention to politics, and participate in politics, and the organization of political parties has emerged accordingly. However, under China's current party-rule system, political power is in the hands of our party, and politics is guided by our party. The opportunity for the people to participate in actual politics is that in the near future, there is no other way than to join our party. Moreover, because the party is the party that exercises civil rights on behalf of the people, the fate of a country is largely tied to whether our party is sound. Therefore, if talented and capable people can join our party to contribute their abilities, not only can their political instincts be brought into play, but also helping our party is helping the entire China. Its significance is also very great. There were originally communist parties and so-called national socialist factions in the country. However, the Communist Party is kept and manipulated by Soviet Russia, and its nature is directly equal to that of Puyi, Japan's puppet, and the so-called Soviet in the red areas is also the same in form and substance as the puppet Manchukuo. How can we allow these traitors who sell themselves and forget their ancestors to seize the leadership of the Chinese revolution? As for the national socialists, although there was the organization of the Chinese Youth Party in the past, the party members are less than 1,000, the leaders have no ability, and their claims are all picked up from others and cannot form their own school. The misery of their present decline and the bleakness of their future can be judged without closing the coffin. Therefore, our party is not only the only large party in the country today, but it will also be the only large party in the country after handing over political power and disarming in the future. Therefore, for this very promising party, what concerns do our compatriots still have and why do they hesitate to move forward? Talented people, come on! Initiated by the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, According to the statement made by the person concerned, Chen Jingxu, in the news column of this newspaper on the 9th of this month, regarding the case of Li Shilin suing Shangxian堂 Hospital, there is a point about Dr. Chen Jingxu, which says (On the afternoon of July 4, I asked Dr. Chen Jingxu to come for consultation. As soon as I entered the patient's room, I felt a strange stench. Dr. Chen said that it was probably puerperal fever. After a closer look, the patient's body had red and white spots, and the temperature was as high as 108.8 degrees. It was indeed puerperal fever, which was caused by incomplete disinfection during the operation and improper washing after delivery), etc., which is quite different. I was invited to diagnose the condition of the deceased Li Wang氏 on July 4. At that time, in addition to stating the temperature of 104.8 degrees and the rash on the body, I never witnessed the operation and nursing washing during childbirth, and I had no reason to comment arbitrarily. As for the patient's experience, I have already made a report and submitted it to the court with my signature and seal. I am not responsible for any reports or rumors that have not been agreed to by me. I am only afraid that the outside world does not understand the truth. Therefore, I ask your lawyer to correct the facts and come forward. Based on this, I sincerely request your newspaper to publish it in the correction column of the letter to the editor tomorrow. This is my sincere request. To the Editor of the China Newspaper, Lawyer Huang Yiyan, August 12th, No. 22</p>

<p>Many readers are happy to know the reading life of people other than themselves. This is of great significance in exchanging personal reading life experiences. Because even if a hundred people read the same book, the results are rarely completely consistent because of the different reading lives of each person. Therefore, the experiences of others can not only be used as our reference, so that we can reduce some difficulties in the reading process, but also encourage us to move forward bravely and understand the hardships of learning. Therefore, things like reading experience talks have always been respected. Now let's talk about the general phenomenon of the reading life of our five or six hundred (limited to registered) readers! Naturally, we know it is still limited, but even based on the only materials we have received, we can extract the following important points, which are worth introducing in the Tao里. First, everyone is struggling for life while taking time out of their busy schedules to read. Life indicates their reading purpose and direction: and indicates the practical method of studying. They have gained many valuable experiences in this struggle, which cannot be obtained from books. Second, because reading can be based on the above practical experience of life as a starting point, the readers' progress is very rapid, and they often find answers to the difficult parts of the book in the practice of life. This phenomenon is not easy to see in school education. Third, they broke the pedantic atmosphere of (you must have a good environment to read). Because of the particularity of their respective lives, behind the counter of the store, in the workshop of the factory, when they were free, they wrote, in the public dormitory, in the park, on the tram, in the restaurant, they took out the books whenever they had time. They were able to make good use of the environment, overcome the environment, and repel all negative emotions. Fourth, they don't know a little then they have, once they know a little, they urgently demand to use it, as if they can't use the theory in the book, the book still can't be believed. Fifth, the more they read, the more dissatisfied they become, and the more and more complex the questions they ask us. Recently, Mr. Tuoluoqi wrote a thin book of questions to us. It can be seen that the readers' questions can only arise from (reading), and careless people can't even raise questions. In short: our readers are all moving forward on their own. In the past two months, it has been (sweating while reading intensely.)</p>
<h3 id="e204">Publishing the Letter from the Author of "Six Soldiers" <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>In the 20th issue of this magazine, an article by Lu Huo entitled (Special Issue on New Poetry Creation) was published. Now we have received a letter from the author of (Six Soldiers). The poem (Six Soldiers) is helpful. Mr. Lu Huo: After reading your article (Special Issue on (New Poetry) Creation), I would like to say a few words to you, because I am the author of (Six Soldiers). (Chorus Poetry) As soon as we see this thing, we will understand that it is imported. It is said to be popular in Europe and the United States, but what I have seen is written by workers. I don't know if there are any written by soldiers. In China, I heard that Mr. Yang Sao has written it? Whether the result is a failure or a success, no one knows, because few people know where he published it. After (Six Soldiers), I wrote...Two Brothers, Defend Russia, Wake Up, Manchuria! (These things may be accumulated together and meet the world, but I dare not say it now.) They all failed, and the reason is as Mr. said (there are many places that cannot be sung together, and singing is not tense, incomprehensible, and the words spoken by many characters must be introduced like a play.) Why is this? My experience is this: For example, Goer德's (120 Million), only a rectangular table is enough. But the setting for writing about soldiers is different. First of all, it is not easy to perform; especially in China, it is difficult to write things. Originally, I wanted to write this poem from three aspects: the war scene, the officers, and the soldiers, but the result is that only the last bit can become a (?) chorus, and the first two major paragraphs have become a burden. This really has to be said to be (defeating its purpose)! The few poems written later have been partially improved, but the material is still soldiers, so it is another failure. To tell the new comers about my failure, (I hope (Six Soldiers) can do a little bit of (introducing jade by throwing brick). If you are not absolutely necessary, please do not take the material from the soldiers, because this is extremely difficult to write well. Of course, there are many things that can be taken from. In terms of form, I think that the minimum limit is that Europeization should be avoided, because the writer is Chinese and the reader is also Chinese. It is necessary to make one's own work an antidote to the reader's pain. I believe that a nation has its unique characteristics, that is to say, the form may be national. The dialogue written in is best written by the author and then ask a few friends to sing it on the spot, and modify the inappropriate places immediately. This may become a perfect mass chorus poem. The above are my opinions. I hope you can publish the letter. Dou Yinfu</p>

<h3 id="e206">The Necessity of Europeanization in Literary Language <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Long Gonggong</p>
<p>I am not accusing Mr. Wen Gongzhi of pretending to be a representative, directly advocating for Mr. (Combert), and secretly intending to promote Western aggression. However, I fully agree with the idea of (adding some Europeanization to Chinese grammar). Especially in translation and creative writing, for the sake of (precision and accuracy), the Europeanization of vocabulary and grammar is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>A certain gentleman once said that the strength of classical Chinese lies in its vagueness and ambiguity, which is true. Vernacular Chinese is more (precise and accurate) than classical Chinese, so the proportion of Europeanization cannot but be greater. Popular language is even more (precise and accurate) than vernacular Chinese, so there is no doubt that Chinese grammar will become even more Europeanized in the future.</p>
<p>In fact, the Europeanization of Chinese grammar did not begin with the emergence of vernacular Chinese or Mr. Combert's advocacy. There were (opium "pilisuon") in Liang Qichao's classical Chinese writings. Before him, (Sanskrit) was commonly used in ancient texts. And for the machine workers in Guangdong, words like (spare), (spiral), and (switch) have become part of their daily language for the past twenty years. These people may not necessarily be (directed by imperialists), so why does Mr. Wen only blame Mr. Combert?</p>
<p>Most of the current literary works in China are a kind of game of vague and ambiguous concepts. Very few can concretely describe a chair or finely portray an action. They almost completely lack the ability to create images with language. This is probably due to the excessive number of people whose thoughts are similar to Mr. Wen Gongzhi. However, once exposed to Western literature, even literal translations cannot lack Europeanized vocabulary and grammar. Can China hope to produce great works?</p>
<p>The basic skill of Europeanization is the use of punctuation, which is a well-known fact. However, even this necessary basic skill is quite difficult to master. For example, if you put a question mark after the sentence (I really don't know where to start), it would be considered an error. Mr. Wen Gongzhi has not advocated abolishing punctuation marks, and he uses them himself, so it seems that (necessity) is beyond doubt. However, even this small point has not been understood, which shows that although Chinese people may be useful, they cannot necessarily speak well.</p>
<p>Gorky could speak, and spoke very well. He described a (failed writer). Let me copy two sentences for everyone to see:</p>
<p>(The young man, as he spoke, twisted the sparse and lusterless hairs on his upper lip with his mouth, half-closed his melancholy, yellowish-white eyes, and very carefully poured himself a glass of vodka with a trembling hand.)</p>
<p>(...His loose cheeks were covered with red streaks formed by many small veins, and his nose was poisoned by alcohol, turning chestnut-colored, drooping above his upper lip in a miserable way.) (Random Recollections: Page 75)</p>
<p>From these two examples, anyone can see the poverty of Chinese vocabulary and the incompleteness of grammar. However, it is entirely due to the Europeanization of those sentences that they can convey a few percent of the characters Gorky wanted to describe. Who would be willing to rewrite those two sentences using (pure Chinese vocabulary and grammar)? They would then know that the true intention of the imperialists is probably to have Chinese people use (classical Chinese) entirely. If one only has a vague and ambiguous concept of everything, one will naturally not be able to speak clearly about the imperialists' acts of aggression.</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Issue of Europeanization <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Xian He</p>
<p>Now is the time when the discussion of popular language is at its peak. There are already many articles against classical Chinese, but very few discussing the issue of Europeanization.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw Mr. Combert's (joke, just treat it as a joke), which touched upon this issue. This is naturally valuable, but because the argument is ambiguous, it can easily cause misunderstandings.</p>
<p>My biggest regret is that Mr. Combert treats the serious matter of attacking Europeanized vernacular Chinese as just a joke. But in fact, it is definitely not like that.</p>
<p>I think it is right to oppose Europeanization, because what the public can understand is definitely not the difficult and obscure Europeanized vernacular Chinese. A characteristic of foreign languages is that there are many descriptive words. Often, to describe a simple thing, a series of adjectives is needed. This is of course (precise), as Mr. Combert said, but if it is imitated improperly or excessively, it becomes (cluttered). In foreign languages themselves, it is of course a progressive thing, because it can express more complex thoughts and feelings. But after Chinese writers imitate it, it becomes a pile of rubbish that does not make sense. Now, no matter which literary book on the market you open, it is often full of long sentences, with some inappropriate or even incoherent "de" characters in between. Needless to say, this is the result of deliberate imitation. Especially the fourteen-line poems in new poetry, which are simply upside down and装得異常古怪 (decorated extraordinarily strange), even college students majoring in literature will not understand. The reason for this phenomenon is mostly due to the authors' curiosity and blind worship of foreign things, and not because the inherent vernacular Chinese is not enough. In fact, it is a very superficial and ordinary thing, but they insist on pulling on a bright and dazzling foreign tiger skin in an attempt to cover up ugliness, resulting in incoherence or awkwardness. Is this also the (precision) that Mr. Combert wants to promote?</p>
<p>The most important thing is to strictly distinguish between (mysterious) and (cluttered). We demand clear and fluent writing to match substantial content, but we oppose the rambling and verbose Europeanized vernacular Chinese. Of course, I am not saying that we absolutely cannot adopt modern European and American literary styles, but I am attacking the new-style formalistic writing that is currently popular, which is forcibly imitated by general writers and scholars without being assimilated.</p>
<p>Moreover, what I am referring to here is creative writing. Translation should be more tolerant. However, it is naturally more desirable to be able to translate (foreign languages) with (Chinese), rather than translating (real European languages) with (disguised European languages). At a time when the level of cultural education is very low and the public is already yearning for knowledge, I believe that easy understanding is the first element. If a piece of material that is originally easy to understand is blurred by difficult and obscure writing, it is undoubtedly a sin. Translation should of course be faithful, and should not be arbitrarily changed or deleted, but striving for fluency and conciseness is an important condition, and it is also possible in practice. For example, Mr. Cao Jinghua's translation of (Andrei's Wrong Path) is very smooth and is a powerful example.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Combert's examples of place names, such as (Avenue Joffre) and (Avenue des Soeurs), to defend the necessity of Europeanization, I think it is ridiculous, because this is not (precision) at all. In the current creative writing circle, trendy authors always love to fill in a batch of foreign names, thinking that this is complex and new, making it neither fish nor fowl. Is using glamorous names like (Louise), (Manly), and (Nana) to replace (Little Cat), (Emerald), and (Shi Chai) what Mr. Combert calls (precision)?</p>
<p>In short, I strongly oppose the currently popular formalistic vernacular Chinese, because it is alienated from the people and is a form forcibly copied by intellectuals without digestion. But I definitely do not completely deny the role of modern European and American literary styles in helping to establish a popular language, or stubbornly uphold national essence like conservative gentlemen. Therefore, my fundamental proposition is: to (abandon) the (Europeanized vernacular Chinese).</p>

<p>— Lin Xi</p>
<p>Why do you always walk silently up this silent slope, facing the setting sun? Whenever the setting sun lengthens the shadows of the trees, I always see you gazing wistfully towards the horizon.</p>
<p>The flock of sheep at the foot of the slope knows: the front of the slope was originally covered with continuous green grass. Now that green grass has been trampled by you into a path, and you always linger silently on that path.</p>
<p>Could it be that the setting sun has brought news again - unfortunate? Could it be that the vastness of the distant trees has stirred up your memories? But seeing the floating clouds, you should be vigilant, right? Why are you still walking, walking, silently?</p>
<h3 id="e209">On Physiognomy <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuan Zhai</p>
<p>Everyone has a face, but unless you have (read many people) or learned some Ma Yi physiognomy, it is difficult to distinguish between good and bad, good and evil. Legend has it that Yuan Tiangang was good at physiognomy, but he looked at Li Qiao's face for three days and three nights before reaching a conclusion. This shows how profound a (science) it is.</p>
<p>The West is worthy of worship. In the early 19th century, a type of phrenology was popular, which was roughly similar to our country's (bone reading physiognomy). China has sent students to study abroad for many years, but so far, no one has introduced such a science, which is as beautiful as (scientific spiritualism). This shows how bad the students studying abroad are.</p>
<p>However, with the popularity of newspapers and magazines, the advancement of photography and industry, portraits of famous people at home and abroad are reflected in our eyes, and most of them are shocking to the eye. So that's what they look like! Because of the different races, Eastern and Western people have two completely different faces, and each has its own views on beauty and ugliness, right? By carefully observing their appearance, it is not difficult to understand what kind of soul is contained within the skin.</p>
<p>However, when looking at Westerners, whether they are political leaders, movie stars, writers, philosophers... or the like, whether they are serious or unrestrained, you can roughly see traces of struggle. They have a distinct appearance. Even in terms of political figures, Briand's ugly face, Mussolini's round fat man, Stalin's big nose, and Hitler's sad eyebrows all seem to have a kind of characteristic that makes people not feel vague. Whether they are smart or stupid, cunning or straightforward, their expressions are ultimately obvious. Only MacDonald is a little off, but his hypocrisy is obvious, and he is still in the category of being clear.</p>
<p>However, when compared with our country's big and small figures, celebrities and dignitaries, it is really incomparable. This aspect is a blurred image. Not only can outsiders not see anything, but it seems that even they themselves hate that face. When photographed in films, most of them look like they are smiling but frowning, like anger and joy, seemingly serious but also humorous, seemingly merciful but also ferocious, like floating smoke, looming.</p>
<p>(Merely having the appearance) is not possible, which is enough to see the emptiness of the content. The Japanese of the same race are much different, but their appearance sometimes seems to be acting, and their expressions seem to be excessive.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Tracing the History of Popular Language Literature (Part 1) <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>The author has briefly discussed ancient popular language literature in the August 10 issue of this publication. For the sake of thoroughness, this article is also written. Ancient popular language literature is naturally not limited to poetry.</p>
<p>The chapter novels since the Yuan and Ming dynasties still inherited the tradition of storytellers. They wrote in the popular language of the time, simply to make the public able to say it, understand it, and see it clearly. *Water Margin*, *Journey to the West*, and *Golden Lotus* are such things.</p>
<p>The origin of *ci* poetry may be related to the songs of the streets and alleys of the common people, but once it enters the hall of elegance, it becomes the exclusive possession of a special group, because only they have the enjoyment of fine wine, women, and singing. There are places with 并水飤 (merging water and feed), and there are people singing Liu Yong's lyrics. I remember that this was the impression gained from an envoy of an enemy country in the Song Dynasty, perhaps referring to the city. Now Liu Yong's lyrics are still there, but they are not necessarily the things of the common people. Even if it is spread to the public, it is like songs like Taohuajiang drizzle, which are popular among rickshaw pullers, but only because they are accustomed to hearing them. However, the real enjoyers of such songs are ultimately another special group. Some literary historians think that *ci* poetry is popular literature, which is extremely ridiculous!</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about drama.</p>
<p>We are not very clear about the dance postures of the early people and the situation of ancient witchcraft dances. From the village exorcism ceremony (鄉人儺) revered by Confucius to the present-day welcoming gods and thanking the gods, this superstitious, barbaric religious ritual has some theatrical meaning and has been related to the development and evolution of drama in history. The *jiao di* (wrestling) of the Qin and Han dynasties, up to the *bai xi* (hundred entertainments) of the Sui and Tang dynasties, in addition to the meaning of entertaining monarchs and bureaucrats, also contained the meaning of showing off authority. In terms of foreign affairs, this could intimidate the surrounding barbarians. The reason why Emperor Wu of Han and Emperor Yang of Sui held *jiao di* and *bai xi* to entertain the barbarian envoys and merchants who came to surrender was this. In terms of internal affairs, this could intimidate the people, let the common people see power, and at the same time entertain them and vent their grievances. This meaning also existed. What's more, this kind of performance originally had the meaning of scaring ghosts, driving away epidemics, entertaining gods, and praying for the year, we can also sense it! In short, the reason why drama arose was due to the contribution of many factors, and it was definitely not just for the entertainment of the public. This is what we should know.</p>
<p>The *da qu* (grand songs), *can jun* (attendant officer dramas), and *guan ben za ju* (official script miscellaneous dramas) of the Tang and Song dynasties were mostly the things of the Jiaofang musicians, serving the court, which had nothing to do with the public. The *yuan ben* (academy scripts) and *za ju* (miscellaneous dramas) of the Jin and Yuan dynasties naturally evolved from these things. It is difficult to investigate what *yuan ben* were like. Judging from the name, since it is the foundation of the brothels, the things popular in the brothels, it should have had the opportunity to be close to the public. Furthermore, *za ju* seems to be a bit different from the later *chuan qi* (legends), which almost completely became a kind of performance for a special group. At least its tunes and dialogue were much more popular and did not intentionally focus on rhetoric and parallelism. However, according to the records we have already found, the performance of *za ju* and *chuan qi* was by Jiaofang actors. It is still doubtful whether there were folk troupes.</p>
<p>Pihuang arose after *chuan qi*, although promoted by a special group, it was related to the public. Not only were its tunes and dialogue using languages and words that were closer to the public, but also such troupes were found in major cities and towns throughout the country, and even in rural market towns. Therefore, we want to say that Beijing opera is an art that is appreciated by both the elegant and the popular.</p>

<p>But in his eyes, everything was beautiful, and every object had a glorious past. Apart from those that he had used himself or that belonged to his family, those that were sold to him by others (this was also five years ago, and in the five years he did not have the money to buy other people's old things) also had their own stories, which the sellers told him with tears in their eyes. At that time, he might also shed some tears, stuff the money into the seller's hand, listen to his thanks, and walk out, leaving this broken thing here. Turning around, he would feel cheated and get angry, scolding his only assistant (this assistant was his grandson, whose name was Alexander, usually called Sasha for short, a young man in his twenties).</p>
<p>He moved to the side. But he clearly imprinted that beautiful story in his mind, and if a customer took a fancy to it, he could tell the story even more movingly, in order to get a good price.</p>
<p>(You must not wrinkle your brow when you see that it is broken, it is a top-quality product made in our Russia. -- But not the current Russia, that group of rebellious countries. This accordion was used by a singer who caused a sensation throughout St. Petersburg in 1851, maybe 52, called something No --, you must forgive me, I can't remember, I am almost seventy years old. -- It was used by him. You must know that this No -- was young and beautiful, and many women were obsessed with him, but he had a bad temper and didn't like those girls. I know that some women who couldn't get close to him bribed his servants to secretly kiss his accordion. If you don't believe me, smell it and see, there is still the fragrance of face powder! He fell in love with a woman who didn't love him at all, and things in the world are so strange. He never got her favor in his life, so he took his piano and jumped into the river and died--)</p>
<p>He warmed the story of this broken accordion in his heart, and a difficulty arose, that is, would saying that its owner committed suicide scare the buyers a little?</p>
<p>But this story made him very satisfied, and even he himself was deceived. He laboriously brought his nose close to the accordion to smell whether there was a fragrance of face powder.</p>

<p>Meeting of the Education and Training Departments</p>
<p>Discussing Military Training Matters</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 13th) The Education and Training Departments held a joint meeting on the 13th to discuss military training matters. According to Pan Youqiang, today's meeting was to exchange opinions on military training and no concrete decisions have yet been made. The summer military training in schools has been decided to be abolished because the stipulated training period of only three weeks is very ineffective. The additional entrance exam for transfer students at Zhongda has been completed.</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 13th) The additional entrance exam for transfer students at Central University was completed on the 13th. Exam papers from both Wuchang and Beiping have been transported to Nanjing. Grading will be completed on the 15th, and results will be announced on the 23rd. Beiping</p>

<p>Recent Reforms (Middle)</p>
<p>- A Conversation with Officials in Charge of the Ministry of Education - (3) The Problem of the Secondary School Graduation Examination In order to standardize the graduation level of students and improve teaching efficiency, the Ministry issued the Provisional Regulations for the Secondary and Primary School Student Graduation Examination in May of the 21st year of the Republic of China. At the end of the first semester of the 21st year, Hunan, Guangxi, and Shandong rushed to hold it. By the end of the second semester, 18 provinces and cities had held it. In order to gather opinions and improve the examination methods, the Ministry sent out a questionnaire regarding the graduation examination at the beginning of the 22nd year to solicit opinions from all parties. A total of 17 provinces and cities replied and compiled the responses as a reference for revising the previous regulations. In December of the 22nd year, the Secondary School Student Graduation Regulations were promulgated, and the Provisional Regulations were abolished. The Ministry again compiled a booklet of statistics on the graduation examinations for secondary and primary school students in various provinces and cities in the 21st year based on the numerical statistics of the questionnaire answers and issued it to the education departments of various provinces and cities to show the best and worst subjects in the 21st year graduation examination, as well as the reasons and remedial methods. The subjects with relatively poor graduation examination results for secondary and primary school students were mathematics and natural science. Therefore, in addition to instructing the relevant departments to earnestly improve, it was stipulated that public and private universities should hold outlines for summer training classes for science teachers in secondary schools and asked the universities to follow them in order to remedy the situation. This summer vacation, the universities have already followed the order to hold them. The secondary school student graduation examination this summer vacation was held uniformly throughout the country, and the results have improved compared to the past. The Ministry has again issued an order to the relevant departments that schools with poor examination results should be warned by the competent education administrative organs and ordered to improve. Those with poor results that are difficult to improve should be ordered to close in order to avoid harming young people. The social bureaus of Beiping and Nanjing have already implemented this, and the remaining departments are also successively complying. Since the Ministry implemented the Provisional Regulations for the Secondary and Primary School Student Graduation Examination to the present, all universities have been instructed to pay special attention when enrolling new students. Those applicants whose secondary school graduation certificates do not have the words "passed the examination" or do not have a certificate of qualification for admission to higher education issued by the competent education administrative organ are generally not allowed to register for the examination. Since the implementation of the graduation examination, people in various places have mostly agreed with the examination in principle, but have criticized the examination regulations and other related issues. After carefully translating various criticisms, there are some misunderstandings. I will briefly describe them below. (A) The Problem of Textbooks As a result of the secondary school student graduation examination in Hebei and other provinces this year, nearly three-tenths or one-third of the students failed. There are many reasons for this, and some argue that the lack of uniformity in the textbooks used by various schools is a major reason. However, the examination questions issued by the education departments of various provinces and cities are based on the secondary school curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry, and the textbooks of various publishing houses must be edited according to these standards. After being reviewed and approved by the Ministry, schools may adopt them. According to the law, schools must not adopt textbooks and books that have not been approved. However, in practice, schools still inevitably violate this. Before there were graduation examination measures, the drawbacks were still hidden. Once the examination was held, the drawbacks were immediately revealed. In the future, if the Ministry's review of textbooks is stricter and the examination of teaching materials by local education administrative organs is stricter, the drawbacks pointed out by the critics can be completely eliminated.

<p>Lisheng Primary School in the French Concession has been established for several years. It has always been exceptionally diligent in its school facilities and emphasizes seriousness and strictness in teaching and management. Therefore, the students' achievements are excellent. Graduates who apply for further education have been admitted to various provincial, municipal, and renowned middle schools. It is reported that Liu Jiazhen, who achieved second place in the Shanghai Junior High School graduation examination, was a graduate of the school. Yesterday, the alumni association, composed of past and present graduates of the school, expressed gratitude for their accomplishments today, which are attributed to the past education and cultivation of the teachers of their alma mater. They obtained the consent of Principal Zhou to convene an alumni meeting in the school's new premises (corner of Huanghe Road and Baille Road), to host a banquet for all the teachers, and to celebrate the victory of classmate Liu Jiazhen, thereby honoring the alma mater. [P Xu Baitang to Study in America&gt;</p>
<p>Xu Baitang, the principal of Shaoxing Jishan Middle School, has been granted leave to study abroad, with the approval of the school board and the special permission of the Graduate School of Columbia University in the United States for his admission. Mr. Xu is scheduled to depart for the United States on the President Hoover on the 14th of this month. It is reported that Mr. Xu was selected as a magistrate in Jiangsu and served as the magistrate of Guanyun, Ganqiao, and Dangshan counties. After the January 28th Incident, he was strongly invited by the elders of his hometown to serve as the school principal. Mr. Xu then abandoned his political career and engaged in education. This time, he is going to the United States to study educational administration. It is also learned that Shao Lizi, the founder of Jishan Middle School, sent a letter from Shaanxi to encourage him to work hard. Xu Baitang</p>

<p>Pudong Middle School attaches great importance to military training. This year's summer military training was approved to begin on the 10th of this month due to the renovation of the school buildings. Students have been returning to school one after another, and the number of registrations is increasing daily. Under the supervision of the principal and military training instructor Zhu Jingqing, the summer military training plan of the Training Supervision Department is followed. The students are organized into two companies according to military methods, with platoon leaders being students. Strict management is enforced. Students rise at 4:00 AM every morning, tidy up their personal belongings, and operate with great intensity. Guards are stationed at the school gate, resembling a small-scale military camp.

The Chinese Walking Association, considering that our country's walking has already achieved considerable results, has sent a letter to the National Sports Association. The board of directors of the association has resolved that if excellent walking results are found at that time, athletes can be sent to participate. It also forwarded a request to include walking as a performance item in next year's National Games and as a formal championship item in the 26th National Games. It is heard that the Walking Association is now stepping up training. The draft of the letter from the Sports Association to the Chinese Walking Association is recorded below. Dear Sir, We have received your letter proposing to send walking athletes to participate in the 11th World Games. The board of directors of this association has decided that if excellent walking results are found in our country, we can select and send athletes. We have written it down for the record.

<p>▲Swap Discount Suddenly Drops to Three Dollars and Fifty Cents▲ The gold market experienced another decline yesterday. The overall trend was still flat, but the swap discount suddenly plummeted. Favorable news about silver led to active selling. Initially, overseas silver markets saw London rising and the U.S. remaining flat. London spot gold increased by half a penny, and exchange rates rose significantly. U.S. cotton fell by 20 points, and U.S. wheat decreased by 1/8 of a cent. As a result, sentiment remained relatively stable. Raw material trading opened with a slight decrease to $56. Gold businesses anticipated lower trading volumes. After the opening, due to bank tightness and abundant exchange rates, HSBC quoted British rates as flat and U.S. rates up by 1/8 of a cent. Settlement prices continued to approach, and the gold market declined. However, it managed to maintain some level after the drop. Therefore, the situation was highly volatile in the middle of the day. Eventually, there was a slight source of spot goods in the market, but spot dealers had no appetite. The swap discount suddenly dropped, affecting sentiment and creating a downward trend. Due to the strengthening of the exchange market, selling was more prevalent, leading to a further decline. However, there was fierce struggle at the $50 mark, making it extremely difficult to predict the market direction. Later, a private cable from New Fuhong Trading Company stated that the U.S. government had decided to purchase large quantities of silver abroad, with the possibility of silver prices rising to one dollar. Selling intensified, and other foreign firms also received similar messages. Gold prices then retreated below $50, showing a sudden weakness. The market became hesitant after Western brokers dumped December U.S. dollars at $36, but struggled. Afterwards, the domestic market strengthened, with December U.S. dollars rising above $36. The market followed suit and declined. Finally, news from Bombay reported only a one-anna increase, halting the selling momentum. Buyers were willing to become active at the lower prices, gradually pulling the market up. The situation remained uncertain. The price of pure gold was $969.10. There was a slight source of spot goods, but the lack of interest from buyers led to a sudden drop in the swap discount to $3.50, which significantly impacted sentiment. Considering the upcoming swap trading for September and October on Wednesday, here is a summary of the day's market conditions: The opening price was $954.10, a decrease of $3.60 compared to the previous Saturday. Raw material opened at $4.20. Exchange rates opened with recent selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling, 4 pence, 5625, and U.S. exchange at $35.25. Ding Kang, Fu Yu, Zhao Feng, Chang Qian, Xiang Fu Xing, Yong Yuan, Yi Yuan Mao, and Yong Ju all sold, gradually decreasing from $4.40. Huabi sold October U.S. dollars at $35.50. Zhengjin sold September U.S. dollars at $35.4375 and retreated to $2.80. Anticipating HSBC's quote of British rates flat and U.S. rates up by 1/8 of a cent, the market retreated further to $2. Banks released October U.S. dollars at 5625. Yuan Yi, Hui Xiang, Yuan Chun, Hong Li, Shun Li, Yuan Feng, and Yong took the opportunity to buy, rising to above $3.

Heng Yu, Tian Feng, Yuan Chun, Yi Cheng, Qing Fa Yong, Tong Tai Chang, Fu Xing Yong, Yong Li and others bought consecutively, and the gold market rotated and rose.

Because the swap was approaching, most spot goods traders short-sold the gold, and the swap should be discounted. Therefore, all spot dealers had no appetite. The swap was lacking in shorts, so Tianjin goods were still hard to sell even with an additional $15. The August swap was suddenly cheaper, with only Tong Yi giving Tong Feng Heng 28 items at only $3.50.

<h3 id="e238">Public Bonds North Faction Stops Selling <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>▲Market Prices Rise and Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market gradually turned strong from being weak because the North Faction mostly stopped selling and buying orders for the Four Bonds became more and more enthusiastic. The principle of accepting the bank savings reserve issue from the banking community is only slightly delayed at present and the panic of the exhaustion of chips in the future is inevitable. The 96 market price has been stable for many days. Although it is already known that there is absolutely no way to do it, the bullish people are still hopelessly optimistic. The market price is not easy to shake temporarily. Yesterday's market price experienced, the opening was consistently weak and lackluster, mostly down a little, two or three jiao, to the 22 mark. Because Four Bonds buying orders were very strong, the market price relied on it to stand firm and slightly stronger, the 23 mark was therefore still better by three jiao. The secondary market saw reductions in troops, fell a little, two or three jiao. After that, more and more incoming buyers, Four Bonds 50 Bonds, etc. all had buying orders, and the market price trended from firm to rising, up five fen, one jiao to three jiao half. The market price result was small five fen to three jiao, and some were better by five fen, one jiao to two jiao. The 23 mark alone was better by four jiao. The total transaction volume was 7.34 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left.

<p>The yarn market is trending firm and the price increase is gradually intensifying. Due to the extremely smooth sales of existing yarn, various gangs are making healthy purchases and the buying atmosphere is stronger. However, the unfilled amount of Japanese businesses has not yet been compensated, so there was a major price increase in the market in recent months. It is said that many factories have removed their bottom goods and chips are gradually becoming scarce.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Golden Rooster Buying Atmosphere Strong <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the spot yarn market was flat. Because US cotton fell, popularity was not strong in recent months, and it fell slightly in distant months. In the second session, raw cotton did not fall and the spot yarn customers still had purchase appetite. In addition, there were purchasing news from the Shu, Yue, and Xiang gangs. Therefore, the market price suddenly tightened in the third session. Buyers came like a tide, and each month rose by 0.8-1.5 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that the actual demand was good. The various gangs have a large absorption, and foreign short sellers still have not filled the market as soon as it opens, the distant months rose by 5-6 jiao. The third session heard that spot yarn had about 3,000 packages a day, and the market situation was especially tight. As a result, each month rose by another 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 jiao. The total daily turnover was 55,350 packages. According to the investigation, Mingde sold 2,450 packages, Zhenda 600 packages, Yuanda 700 packages, Shenchang 2,200 packages, Ruida 2,000 packages, Yuande 1,450 packages, Shenji 950 packages, Run Kang 850 packages, Daji 600 packages, Changyu 950 packages, Hengchang 1,350 packages, and Dachang 1,000 packages.

<p>New Cotton Dumped at Cheap Prices</p>
<p>Large Shorts Added to Positions When Prices Rose</p>
<p>The cotton market is flat and sluggish. Because of the decline in foreign cotton and the domestic new cotton report is still good, if the weather does not change after autumn, the cotton market is difficult to look high. Therefore, a large number of short sellers are dumping, and the table is overwhelmed by them. The factories are also waiting and watching, with no intention of purchasing. Moreover, the demand for old cotton in this month is quite small, so the cotton market is weaker than the yarn market.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Rising and Falling Cotton Futures <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>The cotton futures market opened with American cotton falling 20 points and Indian cotton also declining. Bullish traders were inactive, and the market felt tight, with each month rising by 0.12 yuan. Major short sellers took advantage of the rise to increase their positions, causing the market to slightly decline. The afternoon opening was still good, but after two or three rounds of trading, it suddenly fell back because the price of new cotton offerings was relatively low, and factory purchases were not strong. The market price suddenly fell, resulting in each month falling by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 113,800 dan. Sales included 4,500 dan of Jifeng cotton, 1,700 dan of Dafeng cotton, 2,600 dan of Tongji cotton, 1,600 dan of Yuanda cotton, 1,300 dan of Jinchang cotton, 1,700 dan of Shenchang cotton, 1,300 dan of Yuanda cotton, 1,700 dan of Tonghe cotton, 6,400 dan of Xincheng cotton, 4,200 dan of Deji cotton, 3,300 dan of Hongchang cotton, 3,600 dan of Yifeng cotton, 3,700 dan of Changhe cotton, and 1,600 dan of Renfeng cotton.

<p>Amidst a Frenzy of Falling Foreign Wheat Prices</p>
<h3 id="e245">Futures Flour Collapses <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>▲October Futures Break Through the 0.6 Yuan Mark▲</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market experienced a rare and violent decline in all months after the morning opening. Foreign wheat quotes from Chicago fell by about 1.67 yuan, and Canadian wheat fell by a huge 2.23 yuan. The market sentiment had already been wavering in the previous week due to the gradual increase in factory inventory. Declines had been frequent, suggesting a possible rebound. However, with the sharp fall in foreign wheat prices, the price of spot foreign wheat, though not determined by local factories due to tariffs, was easily set by factories in Shandong Province, which were not bound by such restrictions. Due to these concerns, market sentiment turned sharply negative. The opening price for the current month fell to 0.61 yuan, a significant drop of 0.15 yuan compared to the previous week's closing price. Prices for subsequent months also fell by 0.1 yuan. However, after the sharp decline, short sellers rushed to cover, and the market rebounded slightly, rising by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan in the first session. In the afternoon, the situation looked grim. The degree of the fall resembled the frenzy of a rise, because various factories pushed down the prices, while most of the bullish traders were outsiders, so they had no power to resist the headwind. As a result, the opening price for the current month fell sharply again by 0.06 to 0.07 yuan, and prices for September and October also plummeted simultaneously. Prices for August, September, and October all fell below the 0.6 yuan mark, a difference of more than 0.3 yuan compared to the highest market value at the beginning of the previous week. Although such a rapid rise and fall each had its basis, careful consideration suggests that they were not realistic and seemed to have a cause-and-effect relationship. As a result, the current month fell by a staggering 0.175 yuan compared to the previous week, September fell by 0.1825 yuan, October fell by 0.185 yuan, November fell by 0.1775 yuan, December fell by 0.1625 yuan, and January fell by 0.1525 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day reached over 1.8 million bags.</p>
<p>The wheat futures market experienced an unprecedented plunge.</p>
<h3 id="e246">October Futures Fall by as Much as 0.8 Yuan from the Highest Point <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market saw a sharp decline across all months after the morning opening. Foreign wheat quotes from Chicago fell by about 1.67 yuan, and Canadian wheat fell by about 2.23 yuan. With the adverse turn of events abroad, domestic grain prices also turned from their peak. Yesterday's sharp fall in foreign wheat prices greatly impacted the sentiment of both industry insiders and outsiders. Opening prices for near and distant months fell sharply by about 0.2 yuan compared to the previous week, and by as much as 0.25 yuan for distant months. The closing price rebounded slightly as the trend became clearer. In the afternoon, due to the instability in the flour market and the possibility of approaching pricing for imported wheat, market sentiment changed again, and prices for all months plunged again. Most amateur bullish traders also rushed to sell. The magnitude of the fall set a new record since the exchange was established. In the end, compared to the highest record on the 8th of this month, the current month fell by 0.58 yuan, September fell by 0.55 yuan, October fell the most by 0.7 yuan, November fell to 0.6 yuan, and December fell to 0.54 yuan. Compared to the previous week's closing price, the current month fell by 0.33 yuan, September fell by 0.37 yuan, October fell by 0.35 yuan, November fell by 0.41 yuan, and December fell by 0.36 yuan. In the spot wheat market, factories unanimously rejected purchases, and while the market called for 4 yuan, factories showed no interest.</p>
<h3 id="e247">New Hunan and Anhui Rice Already on the Market Yesterday <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Old Xiaojiao Rice Falls Below the 10 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>Three Hundred Bags of New Taizhou Rice Arrive</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign *xian* rice market saw gradual activity as new rice from various regions entered the market. New rice from Taizhou, Hunan's Jinggang, and Anhui arrived in Shanghai. In addition to ordered foreign rice, there were also shipments of *chong'an* glutinous rice from Hong Kong. As a result, the foreign rice market saw a decline, especially old Xiaojiao rice, which was affected by the new rice. It opened at 10.15 yuan and fell to 9.9 yuan in the afternoon, a drop of 0.25 yuan. Subsequently, hoarders were willing to lower the price to 9.8 yuan, but no major buyers inquired. In this way, it not only fell below the 10 yuan mark but also had to be lowered by another 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. Saigon rice was also expected to decline, but high-quality Saigon rice, such as Pagoda Brand, only had over a thousand bags in stock, and the owners were still asking for 12 yuan. Foreign rice was distributed from Jiujiang and inland areas of this street. New Taizhou rice opened at 10 yuan, then 9.9 yuan, and finally 9.6 to 9.7 yuan, with over 300 bags purchased from this street. Other *xiang*, *han*, Shashi, Jing, and Chu processed rice were all purchased by inland buyers, totaling 3,800 bags. As inland buyers eagerly purchased processed rice, market prices continued to rise gradually, and shipments of *xian* rice continued, slightly weakening the market.</p>

<p>– Soybean Cake Factories Have Also Shut Down –</p>
<p>Yesterday, soybean oil prices plummeted by 1.8 yuan due to the weakening production prices and sluggish market sentiment. 500 pieces of Qidou soybean oil were traded by sand boats, with the opening price at 12 yuan. Other oils and peanut oil also saw sharp declines, with buyers temporarily sticking to lower bids.</p>
<p>Due to the severe drought and the arrival of autumn, the demand for soybean cake suddenly disappeared. As a result, factories shut down one after another. Only customer cakes and recycled goods were still available on the market, so the market situation stabilized.</p>
<p>Due to the decline in cake sales, factories were inactive with regards to old yellow soybeans, and continuous small telegrams led to depreciation and decline. Yesterday's selling price had to be lowered by a fraction compared to last weekend. Five to six cartloads of various beans were traded, all in small quantities. New beans were sold as soon as they arrived, with a better sales path than old beans, so the market sentiment was stable.</p>

<p>Since the price of Jinshan mushrooms fell, the difference has been close to ten yuan. The trend has been stable in recent days, without much fluctuation. Yesterday, the market price suddenly rebounded, with better quality goods rising by a maximum of two yuan and ordinary goods rising by about one yuan. The market is expected to follow suit today, a true small rebound after a big fall.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Piece Goods: N绒 (Woolen Fabric) Recover Slightly Due to Favorable Exchange Rates <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>Chuanbei's (Northern Sichuan) Shanghai offices have been actively purchasing woolen fabrics recently, but the market has remained peaceful. Plaid Walt woolen fabrics are mostly priced at 3.75 yuan, Tianyou No. 1000 medium-thick serge at 5.5 yuan, Ningfeng Ruyi pattern at 5 yuan, No. 42,000 tweed at 6 yuan, No. 18,000 summer tweed at 6.5 yuan, No. 1 riding breeches cloth at 8.25 yuan, and No. 2 at 6.25 yuan. This is due to the continued favorable exchange rates and the decrease in customs duties. Yesterday, HSBC's listed exchange rate for British currency was 1 shilling and 4.5 pence, and buying settlements from foreign firms could secretly raise it further. On average, each yuan in national currency could be sold for 16.6875 to 16.75 pence. As a result, the cost of imported woolen fabrics was somewhat reduced. Previously, each yuan in customs duties required 2 yuan plus some change in foreign currency, but now it only requires 1.93 yuan. Thus, the average import duty per box could be reduced by more than 20 yuan compared to before.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, while I was secretly worried alone, the rest of the female officials, palace maids, and eunuchs did not seem to have any feelings. They only knew that a small incident had occurred, that the Empress Dowager's beloved antiques and jade artifacts had fallen. They reacted as ordinary people would to such an event, rushing forward to quickly pick up what had already fallen and support what was about to fall, almost everyone exerting all their strength. But this commotion threw the small court on the train into complete disorder and chaos. In the palace or in the Summer Palace, it could be said that such a loss of composure had never happened in hundreds of years! If those courtiers who had previously desperately petitioned against the Empress Dowager's risky train ride to Fengtian had seen this scene, they would surely shake their heads and stamp their feet, lamenting: (Could we have advised against it? Now you see, isn't this an ominous omen)?</p>
<p>Because I had already accepted that the situation was beyond repair, and perhaps because I was simply terrified, I stood by with my hands in my sleeves, hoping that the Empress Dowager herself would come up with a good way to remedy the situation. But she didn't say a word. I couldn't help but turn my head and glance at her—with great fear in my heart—but to my surprise, she was smiling gently. At such a time, that she could not only remain calm but also give us a warm smile was truly a rare event! A great weight lifted from my heart. But I was so scared that I almost fell. My legs were trembling uncontrollably, and my hands were as cold as winter. I thought that if everyone were as scared as I was, standing frozen and just watching those things fall and break, we would inevitably suffer a terrible ordeal. Fortunately, they forgot the dignity of the court and acted in such a hurried and chaotic manner, which made the Empress Dowager turn anger into laughter and turn a major event into nothing. It was truly a great stroke of luck amidst misfortune! (104)</p>
<h3 id="e252">Entrance Examinations During the Summer Vacation <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Xue</p>
<p>These past few days have been truly difficult for me. Holding my high school diploma, I rushed to Shanghai to take the university entrance exams. In the sweltering heat, we battled in the examination hall. Universal balm and *bagua dan* pills were our essential medicines for this "civil service exam." Under the pressure of "hot," "extreme," and "suffocating," we were either drenched in sweat or so anxious that our faces turned pale as paper. I can't produce any sophisticated writing, so I'll just adapt two of Wang Bo's famous lines to describe us exam-takers: "(Sweat and ink fly together, faces and paper share the same color)." Of course, I couldn't be excluded from the exam-takers.</p>
<p>(A cunning rabbit has three burrows.) Taking university entrance exams is the same; there is little hope if you only apply to one school. All of us taking the entrance exams had to apply to at least three universities, and I was no exception. I took exams for Tsinghua, Jiaotong, and Zhejiang universities, fulfilling the saying "(Rising from three exams)." When taking the Tsinghua exam, describing the face of a beggar was difficult for me. When taking the Jiaotong exam, mistakenly building a Shaanxi house was difficult for me. When taking the Zhejiang exam, my whole back was sore, which was difficult for me.</p>
<p>When taking the Tsinghua exam, the science questions weren't particularly difficult, but the English questions were truly unbearable. The other examinees were also staring blankly, pens in hand. I was one of those staring blankly. The general meaning of the question was: "(If a beggar asks you for money, what does the beggar's face look like before you give him money? What does the beggar's face look like after you give him money? Describe the two appearances of the beggar in no more than 150 words.)" Heavens! How could I describe a beggar's face in 150 words? I wish I could grab a vagrant and experiment on him in real time!</p>
<p>When taking the Jiaotong exam, there was a question in the general knowledge section that required translating a classical Chinese phrase into modern Chinese: "(Qin had no *lu*, not because there were no *lu*, but because everyone could make *lu*)." At first glance, translating these few words seemed effortless. I immediately wrote down (Shaanxi had no houses, not because there were no houses, but because everyone could build houses.) I thought I was probably correct. After leaving the exam hall, I told my teacher, Lao Jia, who laughed and said: "(You're mistaken. The original text comes from the *Kaogong Ji* in the *Zhouli Dongguan*. The character *lu* doesn't mean house; it refers to the shaft of a spear or halberd.)" When I heard this, I was initially disappointed, then amused. That day, I wasn't the only one who mistakenly built a Shaanxi house. Probably 99 out of 100 people were confused by the two meanings.</p>
<p>When taking the Zhejiang exam, the questions weren't difficult, but the seats were too cramped. I took the exam for three days, and my back ached for three days.</p>
<p>Each time I took an exam, I had to undergo a physical examination. I weighed 105 pounds for the first exam, lost one pound for the second exam, and lost another half pound for the third exam. (Doesn't see an ounce of meat, the same when taking the exam.)</p>
<h3 id="e253">Difficulty of Going Abroad <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Cape Prisoner</p>
<p>Foreigners coming to China have always been as if entering an unpopulated land, our customs officials greet them with open arms. Chinese people, on the other hand, not only endure all sorts of hardships and bitterness when residing abroad, such as in colonies, but even taking a single step outside the country's borders has recently become as difficult as (the road to Shu).</p>
<p>(Nanyang), for hundreds of years, has always been like the outer prefecture of our Fujian and Guangdong provinces. Annam, Siam, Burma, British Malaya, American Philippines, Dutch East Indies... These places? Our overseas Chinese population numbers in the tens of thousands in some places and in the millions in others, far exceeding the number of white residents of the ruling countries. The development and prosperity of these places have largely been fueled by the blood and sweat of overseas Chinese. However, now, in order to limit Chinese people, the colonial governments only allow you to return, not to enter, creating a situation of (being able to leave but not to return).</p>
<p>Recently, a friend responded to an invitation from an overseas Chinese school in Singapore. Anxious to get to the opening of the school, he hastily set off, obtained a passport, paid the ten yuan entrance tax, had it signed by the British Consul in Shanghai, and went to buy a ship ticket. Singapore! Only a few steps outside our South Gate! But you have to take a foreign ship. Each ship is limited to carrying fifteen Chinese to Nanyang, and tickets are sold out well in advance. Although there are many empty cabins on board, they would rather transport air. My friend was impatient and heard people say that there were more ships available in Hong Kong. So he bought a ticket to Hong Kong first. Unexpectedly, when he arrived in Hong Kong, he learned that there were dozens of times more people waiting for ships to Nanyang than in Shanghai. Some had been waiting in hotels for more than half a month. The hotels were raising the price of ship tickets like stocks with triple the dividends. After waiting for more than ten days and going through many twists and turns, he finally scraped together a high-priced third-class ticket and set off towards the scorching equator. It is still unknown whether the journey ahead will be smooth. Now, new arrivals to the Dutch East Indies have to pay an import tax of more than 300 yuan in national currency, and those going to the Philippines have to pay more than 1,000 yuan in Philippine currency (?). Poor Chinese people don't even have a share in going abroad to find a loaf of bread!</p>

<p>— Ma Ying</p>
<p>Our neighbor has an old woman who is already in her sixties this year. Her maiden name is probably only known to herself, because her married name is Wang, so everyone calls her Old Woman Wang.</p>
<p>We are not very familiar with Old Woman Wang's history, but we heard the elders talking: she was widowed three years after she married, and she vowed to remain chaste. At that time, she was only twenty years old. It is indeed very rare for such a young woman to have such a strong concept of chastity.</p>
<p>She endured hunger and cold, working alone, resting alone, only her shadow was her companion.</p>
<p>It is said that in the first year of her widowhood, she did not speak a word to any strange man except for a few close elders.</p>
<p>At that time, the forces of old ethics were particularly strong in the countryside. Old Woman Wang's act of living a solitary and bitter life to maintain chastity for her husband had long been respected by the respectable people. But on the other hand, the so-called petty vagrants and idlers in the countryside, like swarms of bees and butterflies, gathered all their strength to attack her.</p>
<p>In the spring of the second year, flowers sprouted, grass grew fragrant, swallows chirped, and butterflies danced in pairs. That light, intoxicating spring air entered the hearts of every young man and woman, as if they were mesmerized. Old Woman Wang at this time! At that time, she was only twenty-one years old, don't be misled by the word "old"! Her actions suddenly changed. One night in March, something unexpected happened: Old Woman Wang, under the threat of a man, in the nick of time, suddenly felt a chill in her heart, violently pushed the man away, fled out the door, and finally threw herself into the river. Fortunately, she was rescued and did not lose her life.</p>
<p>After that, she would avoid men from a distance when she saw them. It is still like this now. But now she is old. Sometimes, sitting in front of the door, she looks up at the sky, and a lonely sadness seems to be hidden in the wrinkles on her face.</p>

<p>— (Xin Ren)</p>
<p>Because humans have a strong love of beauty, often having a small scar on the face will lead to a lifetime of unhappiness, or be considered a lifelong regret. But our clever ladies will use beautiful hair to cover the defects of the face, at the same time, just like wearing dark glasses because of a blind eye, which leads to more inconvenience.</p>
<p>Acting cute and coquettish is the most effective husband-managing technique for ladies, but it also depends on the occasion. Sometimes it will lead to annoyance and two slaps in the face.</p>
<p>If you want to climb up to a famous dancer, you will see many cold looks from her. At the same time, everything about this dancer is not necessarily that good. If you want to climb up to a dancer whose business is slow, you can not only save money, but also get more benefits. There is a lot to be said about spending the same amount of money, so you must be careful.</p>

<p>— Chen Jingyu</p>
<p>Old friend Mr. Tong came from the old capital, and I met him by chance on the sea yesterday and chatted happily. During the conversation, he asked about the life of my friends and gradually moved on to (Doctor of Quality Studies); I did not know what it meant in a hurry, and after a moment of contemplation, I suddenly understood and laughed together for a long time.</p>
<p>(Doctor of Quality Studies) graduated from the University of Berlin in Germany. After returning to China, he immediately responded to the invitation of the ×× Academy in Beiping and served as a (Philosophy) professor; but on his name card, he wrote in large characters: (Doctor of Quality Studies). His peers were surprised by the novel title and asked him in their spare time: (The name you signed must be (Doctor of Geology). Did the printer accidentally omit the word (Earth) when it was printed)? He said: (No, no! What I study is not the structure of the earth's crust, but the principles of the universe. This kind of theory has a fixed name in European and American academic circles, how can there be any omission)? The questioner then realized that what he called (Quality Studies) was actually a mistake for (Philosophy): simply because (Quality) and (Philosophy) are homophones, the doctor was too broad-minded, which led to (confusing Li with Zhang), casting a big mistake. So he explained the meaning of the words in detail and corrected his mistakes; and the doctor was able to accept the advice and resolutely abandoned it, and never used it again. However, those name cards of his kind, which were scattered in the social field, were numerous, and it seemed as difficult to recover as spilled water; so the grand name of (Doctor of Quality Studies) was popularized.</p>
<p>It is now heard that the doctor has given up his educational career, hiding in the city, (long sleeves are good at dancing), and his reputation is growing. I wonder if, in his spare time, he can look back on the past and remember this old story of (Spring Bright)?</p>

<h3 id="e259">From Foreign Countries to China <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Ming</p>
<p>When I was in elementary school, a Chinese expatriate who had returned from America told me that "there are no beggars in foreign countries because the government prohibits them." So, in my heart, I began to fantasize about what kind of "heavenly kingdom" this "foreign country" was, and even thought about going to that "heavenly kingdom" to enjoy life a little. Later, another Chinese expatriate who had returned from Luzon told me that "beggars are forbidden in foreign countries, but they can change their method of begging. Most of them hold a large handful of pencils and ask passersby for money. If you give them a few cents, they will give you a pencil as a sign of gratitude." Then I understood that the so-called "no beggars in foreign countries" was actually such a trick!</p>
<p>In the Shanghai concessions, beggars are similarly prohibited. Prison vans running through the streets picking up beggars is a common sight. But they can't catch them all. As soon as they leave the gates of the Municipal Council, they can only go back to begging. So, some time ago, they used freight cars to carry beggars to the Zhabei area to disperse them, not allowing them to return to the concessions. Naturally, the concessions are places with special powers, so we have nothing to say.</p>
<p>However, now, "(The Tianjin Social Bureau Massively Arrests Beggars)" (Shen Bao, 9th) but they also cannot catch them all. "Within two days, one branch alone arrested over 400 people. There are still over 20,000 people who wander the concessions making a living by begging." Seeing such a huge number will make your heart cold. If the "Tianjin Social Bureau" completely "captures" them all, the almshouses will definitely be unable to accommodate them, so what will they do with them then?</p>
<p>What is worth noting is "making a living as a beggar," which is truly both serious and humorous. Begging has also become a profession. It's truly laughable to say, but this is a serious problem. There are social reasons for its existence: when the rural economy collapses and urban unemployment is rampant, begging becomes a profession. If we were to tally up all the beggars in the country, the number would be staggering, probably at least one-fifth of the national population. To make so many beggars no longer exist in society, we must fundamentally transform society. Simply "catching" and "expelling" them like the concession authorities is definitely ineffective.</p>
<h3 id="e260">At the Wharf <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Sun</p>
<p>After Uncle Cheng's banquet, all the luggage was moved, and Sister Yin staggered in. Today is a free day for the Buddha-worshipping festival. The room was dark and crowded with people seeing us off; some were seeing off Sister Yin, and some were seeing me off. The noise and shouts of the porters carrying luggage, and the usual farewell words, formed a very harsh sound. Hua, though a maid, was no less sorrowful than me! Her slightly gazing eyes and messy temples will be deeply remembered by me in the future!</p>
<p>The red glow of the setting sun shone on the lacquered red walls. I tearfully said goodbye to my aunts; and boarded the car with my brother and relatives and friends, speeding towards the noisy wharf. The chaotic feelings of parting made me feel uneasy!</p>
<p>The wharf was piled with a crowd of travelers, some returning home in glory, some wandering in destitution, some seeing off their loved ones for a thousand miles, and some leaving their parents far behind. These various kinds of travelers, with their different emotions of sorrow and joy, were naturally a mixture of sorrow and joy. Small boats weaved back and forth on the green waves like shuttles. I finally left my relatives and friends who were seeing me off, and left in a small boat! The fluttering skirt and waving handkerchief gradually blurred in my eyes! Before me was a green, shimmering expanse of gentle waves!</p>
<p>The small boat gradually approached the large ship. Thick smoke, like black clouds, poured rapidly from the ship's smokestack. We held onto the tall ladder, stepped on it cautiously, and carried our luggage into a rather delicate cabin. Ah, this will accompany me on my voyage for more than ten days!</p>
<p>My brother instructed Sister Yin many things, and Sister Yin's father also instructed her many things, probably meaning to teach her to take care of me. At this time, shaking hands with them and saying goodbye, the chaos in my heart cannot be described in words! The wailing whistle urged them to go back.</p>
<p>Leaning blankly against the iron railing, my eyes filled with hot tears almost rolled down! However, I finally tried my best to hold back! Because in the presence of so many eyes, I didn't want to show such weakness. The distant figure of my brother and the small boat slowly swayed towards the shore, my eyes full of hot tears, hold back, hold back!…</p>
<p>The whistle blew a long cry, and the green mountains, green trees, buildings, and houses on both sides retreated backwards. The ship suddenly started moving. The dazzling red light shone on the buildings, and the trees all turned red. Proudly, it seemed to be saying to me: "You child, go ahead! (To the barbaric foreign land,) don't be nostalgic anymore!"</p>
<p>I was filled with endless regret! My precious childhood vanished in the arms of this "(barbaric foreign land)!"</p>
<p>Now, now I want to return, return, with a heart full of longing, returning to my motherland!!!</p>
<p>The poetic coconut breeze and banana rain, and the, and the sunset reflected, the glittering waves of the Mekong River, from now on, from now on I can only savor you in my dreams!</p>
<h3 id="e261">The Little Braid <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Huai Ying</p>
<p>His name is Yang Dake, but the classmates all call him "Little Braid."</p>
<p>On the back of his left head, he wears a long braid. Is that the reason why the classmates gave him this nickname?</p>
<p>Yes, there is really no reason for a twelve-year-old boy like him to keep a braid. When asked about it, he said it was his mother's idea.</p>
<p>"Can't you shave it off yourself?"</p>
<p>If someone else asked him this question, he would think that they were teasing him again, but the one asking this question was me, his teacher, so he had to answer me seriously. He said:</p>
<p>"Mom won't let me shave it off. Mom says this is fulfilling some vow. I don't want to keep it either."</p>
<p>That's right, from the moment someone called him by his nickname, his face would turn red, as if he was a little embarrassed. I knew that he also hated this braid, but because I couldn't guess the reason, I asked like this. So, he is restricted by his mother, no, he is affected by the superstitious mentality under the old social system.</p>
<p>The child is not lacking in intelligence. He can answer and do all his homework, and he also writes a good hand. To be honest, my writing as a teacher is really not as good as his. He can also do everything in games, like kicking a leather ball. It's just that when someone grabs his braid, he looks like a child who has done something wrong and been discovered by an adult, silently hiding in a less crowded place.</p>
<p>He is often late, in fact, it can be said that he is late every day. The time he is late is always half an hour. When he comes, he quietly opens the classroom door, bows to me, and then walks to his seat. The other students then shift their gaze from the books to him.</p>
<p>Because of this, I was very unhappy and had severely punished him, making him stand, making him recite, making him wipe the glass, and even making him sweep the floor. I am a teacher, so I can't help but set an example for other students, which is also meant to warn the others through one person. It's strange, no matter how I punish him, he accepts it silently, not crying, not shouting, and not resisting. However, if you ask him the reason, he won't say it to the death, as if there is something difficult about it. Once, I hit his palms hard, and both pairs of hands were red and swollen, because he couldn't say the reason for being late, but he was late every day! His right hand and left hand were swollen in the same way, so it was not easy to hold the pen in the next calligraphy class.</p>
<p>"You are a cruel teacher!"</p>
<p>Seeing his situation, I regretted it very much. If it wasn't in front of a group of students, I really wanted to run up to him, grab both hands, and kiss them heavily a few times to atone for my sins.</p>
<p>Not only is he often late, but his hands and clothes are also often stained with a layer of rust. I feel that this is related to his being late, so I try to find out, but still, when I ask him what his family does for a living and who they are, he still doesn't answer me. My investigation gets no results.</p>
<p>One Sunday, the tin pot I was using somehow leaked a hole. If it wasn't repaired, it would simply become waste. I decided to find a tin pot shop to repair it.</p>
<p>Our school doesn't have errand boys, so as a teacher, if I want to drink boiled water, I have to make it myself. Naturally, I have to fix the pot myself. Humph, unexpectedly, the tin pot shop I found was opened by Little Braid's mother. He was banging on the tin sheet with a wooden stick. Looking at me, his face turned red, and then he took the pot over and told his mother who I was.</p>
<p>His mother, in addition to asking me to pay more attention to teaching her child, also asked me to forgive him for being half an hour late every day, because that half hour was his working</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>time. Only then did I know the reason why Little Braid was late every day. I also heard a lot about his family's plight from his mother. This made me feel even more guilty about punishing him in the past.</p>
<p>"Little Braid, you are a good child, you are a poor child, I was wrong to blame you." On the way back to school, I repeated this to myself, while staring blankly at the repaired tin pot.</p>
<h3 id="e262">The Dried-Up Little River <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ci</p>
<p>"Green light, white light,</p>
<p>Sun-killing the old clam."</p>
<p>Sanlin'er stood on the grass, it was when the sun had just set. The eastern sky emitted a light like a Japanese flag – which farmers believe is a symbol of tomorrow's drought and heat – in Sanlin'er's mind, it was as if the heavens were calling him to sing a nursery rhyme, tilting his face, pouting his mouth, and vigorously:</p>
<p>"Green light!</p>
<p>White light!</p>
<p>Tomorrow in the Lu Riverbank, a big old clam will be sun-killed!"</p>
<p>Singing, happiness turned into a smile on his face, chasing a pair of big flowered chickens beside him.</p>
<p>The big flowered chickens were chased by Sanlin'er around the bend, rushing to the edge of the water bridge. Sanlin'er chased after them tremblingly, chasing the big flowered chickens to the point where they had nowhere to go:</p>
<p>Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap!</p>
<p>A pair of big flowered chickens had already rushed to the little river there.</p>
<p>The little river was no longer like a river, without a drop of water. In the dry yellow waterweed piles, there were three or four dead fish lying upside down with their bellies white; only in the lowest places was there a small ditch less than two inches wide, and the mud was still a bit soft and moist.</p>
<p>A pair of big flowered chickens jumped and walked on the riverbed, occasionally finding one or two deeper and wider ditches full of moisture and pecking to filter some water to drink, but they jumped away immediately.</p>
<p>Sanlin'er lived by the water bridge, no longer chasing after them, staring at the dry riverbed, and cried:</p>
<p>"Mom! Mom! Sanlin'er wants to eat dinner! Sanlin'er is so hungry!"</p>
<p>I don't know where the person Sanlin'er called Mom was. Sanlin'er cried so much, shouted so much; but there was no shadow.</p>
<p>A pitifully dried-up little river was still in front of Sanlin'er.</p>
<p>Sanlin'er knew that Mom went out in the daylight, to pedal a waterwheel more than half a mile away from where Sanlin'er was standing now; yesterday when Mom came back, it was almost dark, and Sanlin'er was also standing here, crying, seeing Mom coming, he threw his whole body on her, and Mom picked him up and kissed his cheek:</p>
<p>"Sanlin'er, good baby, why are you standing here crying?"</p>
<p>"Sanlin'er is hungry."</p>
<p>"Oh, oh, baby!!"</p>
<p>Mom pointed her lips towards the little river;</p>
<p>"The shallower the water in the river, the later Mom comes back; if it doesn't rain again tomorrow, Mom will come back even later! Baby, good baby, be patient!"</p>
<p>Sanlin'er listened very clearly, seeing Mom's eyes filled with tears, he felt bad and started crying again.</p>
<p>"Sanlin'er, good baby -" Mom really sobbed: "If the water in the river is always dry, Mom will never have food for you…"</p>
<p>The dried-up little river touched Sanlin'er's impression from yesterday: "If the water in the river is always dry, Mom will never have food for you!" Wasn't the little river dry today? Sanlin'er had no food to eat, Sanlin'er was hungry.</p>
<p>The sky slowly darkened.</p>
<h3 id="e263">On Selling Manuscripts <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>Selling manuscripts and writing articles seem to be one and the same at first glance, and it seems impossible to distinguish any difference. In fact, it is not so, the two are very different. Selling manuscripts is one thing, and writing articles is another. Those who write articles generally do not regard writing as a specialized occupation, in other words, they do not make a living by writing, but treat it as a side business, a pastime, or an occasional fit of inspiration, writing something at will. The purpose is not necessarily to earn income from manuscripts, but often to vent the depression in their hearts for a while, or to entrust hidden thoughts to words, or to put their spirit into old chapters. Although the motivations may be different, they are all used to relieve emotions and entertain the eyes. This at least preserves a kind of selfless realm and a kind of intoxicated realm for the author. They write when they are happy, and they stop when they are not happy. Articles and life are separated from each other, so articles are somewhat of a spiritual respite and pleasure for them. As for selling manuscripts, it is completely different. The so-called selling manuscripts, obviously speaking, is to make a living solely by writing, turning articles into a specialized occupation. It closely connects manuscripts and life into a two-in-one relationship.</p>
<p>In this world, no matter what kind of event, if it is something that cannot be separated from one's life until old age, and even something that one is unwilling to do but still has to force oneself to do, then no matter how interesting it is, the original interest will inevitably gradually disappear with the passage of time, and one will gradually become tired of it. Why is writing alone an exception? Moreover, it is easier to feel tired and bored than anything else. At this time, the unique interest of articles disappears. Only those who are immersed in it can truly experience that taste. Once one relies solely on selling manuscripts to make a living, one can no longer have the casual attitude of expressing one's heart's content with a pen, but instead, it always contains the meaning of various struggles in life. Manuscripts are equivalent to life, and all the material resources, even the smallest details, must be produced from the tip of a pen. Life is like a green-faced, sharp-toothed demon, like a sharp leather whip, tightly whipping you, forcing you to move forward. For the sake of life, you cannot help but write, and you have to write even if you grit your teeth.</p>
<p>The pressure of solid reality, so they have to write because they are poor, so they desperately write, but sometimes the poorer they are, the less they can write, but they still have to desperately write, so they have to desperately create crudely and coarsely. For the sake of life, they have to do this, because if they stop writing, they will starve to death.</p>
<p>However, the individual's spiritual accumulation is very limited, not like a mountain spring that flows endlessly, and even a mine will eventually be completely exhausted. Not to mention humans? Therefore, for the sake of the amount of manuscript fees, they have to plan on this, and often in order to get some harvest, they try to lengthen the manuscript as much as possible and add some wasteful content.</p>
<p>When it comes to this, they are no longer writing articles, but have become craftsmen. Speaking of it, in this day and age, manuscripts are paid by the word, and articles are so worthless that there is nothing more to add. It is really a most tragic thing for writers to unfortunately want to warm their stomachs with their pens. Moreover, there is a risk of literary inspiration drying up, but the supply of life is endless. People are not made of iron, nor are they like machines that can continue to run by adding oil. Once Jiang Yan's talent is exhausted, but the manuscript still has to be written, then one has to rack one's brains and squeeze it out forcefully. Therefore, those who haggle over the words and sentences in manuscripts may not be of the highest quality, but they are also worthy of sighing.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Kept Woman <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>What I expected to happen really happened without a doubt: she hasn't come for several days, which proves that the situation itself has undergone rapid changes. I had guessed long ago that she must be selling her only asset – her body – to another man again. In the middle of this month, she came to bother me almost every day, and every night in the dim early morning when the dance hall was over, she always quietly pushed open the door and came in. She turned on the light and woke me up from my sweet sleep.</p>
<p>Looking at her sitting on the edge of the bed, she smiled at me wantonly. Then, she simply leaned her upper body on the quilt and smiled again. At this time, I really felt a little angry. She shouldn't disturb my sweet sleep so absurdly, but on the other hand, I was dominated by a kind of seductive magic. The bright light shone on her face, and the rouge powder was unusually messy. But in that drowsy and tired state, it set off an even more unusual and moving coquettishness.</p>
<p>After she left, I thought of such a prostitute-like woman who lives a night-blooming life every day, and every night in that dark green place, on the melody of jazz music, she plays a charming and enchanting role, letting many strange men hold her in their arms and teasing and mocking her.</p>
<p>Love is gilded, using gold rings to buy temporary pleasure.</p>
<p>I met her in such a place, a commodity-like urban woman!</p>
<p>She would easily become intimate with me, and naturally, she would fall in love with someone else just as easily. I was very clear about it. I would never be infatuated enough to demand long-term possession of her. Moreover, almost every time she left, she never forgot about money, which made me feel cold all over when I thought about it.</p>
<p>It's just a pity that these kinds of women haven't recognized themselves, they look down on chastity as if they were looking down on a piece of paper, and they casually offer their bodies for men to trample on. As long as they can satisfy their material desires, they use their youth to live a luxurious and shameless life, a dissolute life. However, the period of youth, which serves as the decoration of life, is ultimately short and limited. When the time of fallen flowers has passed, it will be too late to regret it, right?</p>
<p>Now her behavior is exactly that of this kind of decadent urban woman. She is accelerating the destruction of her own life. She is sending herself to the edge of the grave step by step. This month of entanglement has really made me feel extremely disgusted with all women. Not just her, but now that she's gone, it really feels like shedding a whole body of debt and being relaxed.</p>

<p>— Lin Bin</p>
<p>Like wildfire, the news spread into the wide gate of a building, reaching the ears of the village chief who was enjoying his opium, making him take a few less puffs. He immediately ordered the local constable to notify the heads of each household to expel this pair of demons creating poisonous germs, for the sake of the village's morals, the reputation of the Auspicious Temple, and for his, the village chief's, dignity. That day, Pockface was sent back to her parents' home, and Fool was banished from the village.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, I went to my uncle's house in Xiufa Village, thirty li away, on business. My uncle's gate was crowded with people, feet upon feet, heads pressed against heads, every eye fixed on the central hall inside, as if watching an absorbing illusion. Loud shouts echoed from the central hall, mixed with miserable and piercing cries, reminding me of the myth of the ox-headed demons of the Yama's palace brutally beating the wicked of three lifetimes.</p>
<p>Curious, I desperately squeezed up the stone steps of the gate, through the wide courtyard also packed with people, and to the front of the central hall. Suddenly, I felt a wave of dizziness, a pang of heartache, and a blur in my vision, as if I had truly entered Yama's palace.</p>
<p>Hanging from the right beam of the central hall was a half-naked body with large bones and thin muscles, hands tied behind, legs kicking frantically in the air. A brute-like man was vigorously whipping the half-dead, half-alive naked body with a red-wood thorn whip. Countless small holes oozed crimson blood, weaving a blurry web of blood. I focused my gaze on the face of the protagonist of this tragedy, and it turned out to be that Fool farmhand who had been banished from the village.</p>
<p>(He's a fool! Why?) I unconsciously said.</p>
<p>(Of course. Would someone who isn't crazy do such a thing? Would he offend a girl from such a family?) said one of the onlookers.</p>
<p>(But why exactly?) I seized the opportunity to ask.</p>
<p>(Haha... Miss Yan Xiufeng's grandmother, in the outhouse,) another said in a low voice, as if afraid someone would hear.</p>

<h3 id="e268">The Original Creator of Hollywood's Only Soviet Star, Anna Sten (Part 2) <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>This was a crucial moment for Anna's future success or failure. At that time, she would never have imagined that she would become a world-famous superstar, let alone that America would invite her.</p>
<p>Frank knew that if she didn't have a role in that film, she would be sent back to her country: undoubtedly, she would fail from then on. But he was unwilling for her to end up like that; he had to find a way to save her. Finally, he confessed to the company that he would pay Anna's salary during filming, and only then did the company agree to let her play the lead role in the film.</p>
<p>So, on the one hand, she worked hard to learn with the guidance of good teachers; on the other hand, she listened to Frank's advice and began to pay attention to her clothing. Under Frank's discerning eyes, she corrected many clumsy postures. In his sensitive ears, she corrected countless incorrect grammar. In just a few months, she transformed a rustic girl into a young lady born in a wealthy family.</p>
<p>As a result, she performed extremely well in the film. The film was a success, and Anna Sten also achieved tremendous personal success. From then on, her position was solidified, and the title of star was added to her name.</p>
<p>Did her efforts change her fate, and did her success change her person? No, it can be said that it did not change at all; she was still the same. Moreover, her success made her afraid. Whenever she met someone even slightly important, she would always ask Frank: (Did I say something wrong? Was my behavior correct?)</p>
<p>Frank built two houses in Germany. Originally, he only needed one for himself, but the German government wanted landowners to build more houses because the tax on vacant land was particularly heavy, so he built two and rented one to Anna. They became neighbors. Frank's wife had died long ago, and Anna often came to visit him and his little girl.</p>
<p>One day, Anna, dressed exceptionally beautifully, ran into his house and exclaimed: (I'm moving!) When Frank heard her words, his heart stopped beating. He gripped her hands tightly, as if afraid she would run away, and asked in a trembling voice: (Where are you moving to?) She said: (I'm moving into your house to live with you; I'm tired of paying rent, and I like this house too!) In the autumn of 1930, they got married.</p>
<p>Their wedding did not add to or subtract from their love. Later, when Goldwyn took Anna to America, Frank resigned from his job and followed her to America. The two of them were always together and never separated. Frank said that movies were his life, and Anna's success was his only wish.</p>
<p>This is a story about Anna Sten that Frank had never told anyone before. (The End)</p>

<p>— Hu Yue</p>
<p>His Man is Mine Shown in Shanghai</p>
<p>(A Couple's Mirror) is a film depicting a love triangle.</p>
<p>A couple who have been married for five years experience a minor emotional entanglement when the man's old flame returns to their town. Eventually, the man's old flame marries someone else, and the couple reconciles.</p>
<p>There is a typical happy ending, a clichéd and well-worn romance, and ordinary and vulgar techniques.</p>
<p>(A Couple's Mirror) does not offer us anything particularly fresh; it is just like any other superficial love film, depicting the messy love affairs of young masters and misses.</p>
<p>(A Couple's Mirror) is similar to "Husband and Wife of Grievances", both narrating the trivial daily lives of the bourgeoisie in modern society.</p>
<p>Here, humorous and lighthearted dialogue amuses gentlemen and ladies, and brisk techniques give gentlemen and ladies entertainment and satisfaction. In this respect, the screenwriter has fulfilled his duty.</p>
<p>However, behind the laughter and satisfaction, how much ugliness is concealed, and how much cruel imagery is prettified.</p>

<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>(Woman) is undoubtedly a successful work among domestic films, I admit. First of all, the script is certainly conscious, depicting everything that three women with different personalities experience on their life journeys. In today's Chinese society, it is truly difficult for women to find a way out. But women cannot sell their souls just because it is difficult to find a way out, nor can they think that marriage is necessarily a solution.</p>
<p>(Woman) has clearly told us that most women, after having children, shift their love for their husbands to their children; and it is at this time that men's feelings towards women become indifferent, and they go off to love someone else. How wrong this is!</p>
<p>(Woman) also clearly indicates to us that since (September 18th Incident), the four northeastern provinces have been lost, and the lost territory has not yet been recovered. But the young people who have lost their souls, like Xiao Ting, have long forgotten this unprecedented national humiliation, and are immersed in dance halls day and night.</p>
<p>(Woman) is warning young people not to live in a drunken dream.</p>
<p>(Woman) not only takes social issues as its center but also contains educational significance, guiding those young men and women in society who are crying out not to go astray.</p>
<p>The director also knows how to use the camera effectively. Although there are many interjections, the audience does not find them annoying. The disputes in the women's dormitory, the villagers' rare and strange sights of seeing a young master bring a Shanghai miss back, and the scenes after (September 18th) of Shanghai city seen are discount banners, street riots, large factories, and large shops, often in bankruptcy. These external scenes can all be a portrayal of the real situation of Chinese cities and villages. Among the actors, Li Minghui does a good job in both the romantic period and the painful period, but when she was abandoned by Xiao Ting and Xiao Fen was burned to death, she never shed a single real tear, perhaps because she is not good at crying? Hu Ping's Jin Ling and Wang Yin's Xiao Ting both performed well.</p>
<p>Xiao Ting is such a frivolous young man, and in the end, he can only stroke the corpse and cry in vain. Regarding this point, it doesn't seem enough to please the audience, I think.</p>

<p>— Yong Sen</p>
<p>(Woman) does not solve the women's problem, nor does it indicate a way out for women.</p>
<p>However, there is a good inspiration given to the audience, which is to say: (Women) should be (good wives and mothers) after marrying their husbands, and should not (rely on their husbands). He narrates the life of Liang Yufen after marriage - waking up late, gambling, and the final encounter - economic hardship, being abandoned by her husband, burning her daughter to death... to awaken this generation of women in modern society, which is more powerful than writing directly. This is the cleverness of the playwright.</p>
<p>(Woman) has already received many praises, but I think there are several points that should be discussed, and it is not nitpicking.</p>
<p>First, Wang Yifang's studying is of course unwilling to do things that (sell the soul), and wants to extricate herself and seek progress. Unexpectedly, she was expelled from school; because of (having been a dancer, which hinders the school's ethos). Perhaps the playwright inserted this to speak out against the Nanjing song queen Wang Yurong; then, it should not be depicted that she specializes in applying makeup and being late for class at school, showing that her habits have not changed.</p>
<p>Second, whether Liang Yufen and others are university students or middle school students? However, judging from the level of chemistry, they are only middle school students. If it is a university course, it is too superficial!</p>
<p>Third, when Hong Xiaoting is (broke), why doesn't he go back to ask his mother for help? Didn't his mother subsidize him with three hundred yuan before he lost his job?</p>
<p>Fourth, when Liang Yufen is in poverty, she sends letters to many classmates to find work. Among them, one or two written forms should be added - Liang Yufen asks Jin Ling to find a job, or Jin Ling helps - because they are closer, and perhaps it will be smoother for the development of the story! I think.</p>
<p>In addition, the scenery is still good, the photography is slightly inferior to (Fisherman's Song), and although the subtitles are vigilant, they are not concise, even a sentence has more than twenty characters, and there are also typos such as one (will eventually do it for you), etc. (The rest is omitted)</p>

<p>Helen Twelvetrees once went to see a movie with her husband in a small suburban movie theater. It was so crowded that they had to sit separately. The movie was gradually getting to the main feature. During the most tense, exciting, and thrilling scenes, Helen was eating a bag of candy. She suddenly thought of her husband, so she handed the bag of candy to a man in the next seat. The man didn't say anything, just slowly pushed the bag away. After a while, Helen handed the bag of candy over again. However, the same thing happened again.</p>
<p>No matter what, she couldn't stand it anymore. So she questioned him why he was doing this. While saying this, she glared at him very angrily. Oh dear! This look was wrong. That person was not her husband!</p>
<p>Then she remembered. She was sitting separately from him, and they were far apart. Since discovering this, she was extremely embarrassed. She wanted to change seats, but there was no second seat to be found. She had no choice but to stop watching the movie, run out, sit in the car, and wait until the theater was over and her husband came out. Afterwards, her husband knew about it and laughed non-stop. Even now, Helen often tells others about this joke.</p>

<p>Laurel's wrist was handcuffed to a detective named Flanagan. At that time, Eddie was coming out with Kai, looking angry. Welsh saw Eddie and greeted him. Laurel also stopped. He said to Eddie: (Friend, don't be mistaken, he is your friend. He has been stirring up trouble all along,) Eddie was about to pounce on Welsh, but Laurel separated them. He said: (Friend, be peaceful, beating him won't be cheap. Since you are released, you should go straight. I am going in, I am not afraid of anything.) This was the beginning of their friendship. Laurel's fist hit Welsh's head, and although they had a moment of pleasure, there were also hidden dangers. Welsh was not someone to be easily dealt with, and the thought of revenge seemed to be burning in his heart. He was planning how to do it.</p>
<p>When Laurel was released from prison, his small eyes shot out treacherous light. He could start with Eddie at the same time. As for Eddie, who lived an honest and rehabilitated life, his conscience and daughter were simply not on Welsh's mind. One day, a prisoner escaped from prison. He was Stone, who had lived in the same prison as Laurel before. Welsh thought his opportunity had come.</p>
<p>Detective Flanagan reported Welsh's affairs to the sheriff, who knew that Eddie and Laurel had reformed. He respected them - he did not believe that they would be suspected of Stone's escape. He looked at Welsh coldly and said: (You have been chasing them enough - several times destroying their careers and hindering them from finding work - now you are not allowed to go and entangle with them anymore!) Welsh was only cautious in front of his superiors. When he got outside, he released his detective nature.</p>
<p>Eddie and Laurel were still very quiet and focused on their work. Laurel was eager to tell Jean about finding a good job. He was a little scared. If he didn't tell her everything, he would never be able to propose to her. But because Kai was so loyal to Eddie, he also hoped that Jean could understand everything. On the eve of Shirley's birthday, Laurel and Jean were dining at Eddie's house. Kai looked at them, she knew to what extent their love had reached, and because her own marriage was happy, her heart also jumped for their romance.</p>
<p>After they left, Eddie played with Shirley as usual. These times were the most enjoyable for him. After a pause, a look of suspicion appeared in Shirley's big eyes. (Dad, what are you giving me for my birthday tomorrow?) He refused to tell her, so she guessed water shoes, foreign dolls, but he just shook his head. (Will you tell me if I kiss you? This voice was even more charming. (Okay, but?) Shirley had already exclaimed excitedly; (Oh, I know, it must be a dance costume!) Eddie didn't understand how she guessed it, and asked how she would think of a dance costume. Shirley's happy reply was: (Because it's still my favorite.) Dance costumes are very expensive, but Kai and Eddie knew that she would be as delicate as a rose when she wore it. (Well, there is only one birthday a year!) Eddie said. But he bought an extra telescope, and if someone who didn't know put it in their eyes, it would leave a black mark on their eyelids. Kai sighed, but she also laughed. (Naughty thing! You want to make Shirley as naughty as you!)</p>
<p>Wasn't that last night? Eddie now stood at the door of the dining room, staring blankly at Shirley and her guests, as if last night had passed thousands of years.
