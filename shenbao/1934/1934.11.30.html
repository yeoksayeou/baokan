<h3 id="c12">艾迪博士來滬演講有感 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>恒·</p>
<p>艾迪博士來華·此爲第九次。我國今日内外交困。無可諱言。而艾氏乃謂中國之希望·莫遇於今茲。國人聞之。能不興奮。孟子亦嘗謂。『無敵國个患者國恒亡·』微之史乘。多難興國之故事。代不絶書。艾氏之言。誠不我欺也。</p>
<p>然艾氏亦爲國人指出亡國之病源矣。是卽國人内在的腐敗是也。此而不除。縱無敵國外患。亦必日趨滅亡。觀夫羅帝國之崩潰往跡。可以恍然故今日之患。尙不在於外。而在於内。艾氏之觀察如是。我人所應深自警惕者也。。</p>
<p>昔賢有言。『國必自伐。而後人伐之。』卽謂國家之亡。必有其内在的原因</p>
<p>也。艾氏以爲貪贓納賄營私舞弊之風氣。實爲我國自伐之鐵證。不惟建設之</p>
<p>落伍。史治之　敗。民生之憔悴。莫非受此腐敗風氣之累。卽東北四省之失。亦應歸咎於此。</p>
<p>我人每覺我國之病源。在於自私。正與艾氏之意。不謀而合。唯其自私。故社會國家之福利。可以視若等閒。而個人利益之所在。則百計營求。猶恐失之。循至貪贓納賄。營私無弊之事。層出不窮。而艱苦險難之救國匡時工作。則望望然去之。鄙不屑爲。卽以學術言。中國今日所以缺乏偉大之發明。此種心理。實爲厲階。又如一『復興農村·』「到民間去·」等等口號。亦唱之屢矣。而民效卒鮮。豈非亦以國人富於自私之心耶。今日之一般青年。好名利。競鑽謀。不願刻苦砥礪致力於其所當務。而政客失意。亦往往閙意見。媚權貴。不肯稍自犧牲·若是者。又豈非因個人榮辱之念爲之中梗耶。總之。國人今日之病。在於自私。在於以個人利益爲唯一之目的。而視其他一切爲工具。一國之間。人與人之關係·旣悉出於自利槪念。則又何能發生眞摯之情感。旣無眞摯之情感。則團結民族國家應有之原動力。又何能發揮而增長。民族國家之原動力。旣不能發揮而增長。則欲其競存於强鄰角逐之今日·不亦難哉。</p>
<p>艾迪之言又曰。中國今日之國難。乃爲對於中國所下之警告。苟能接受此一警告。則復興有望。否則將爲朝鮮之續。蓋自已若不能革除其已往之弊病。解除人民之痛苦。發揚人民之能力。則必無術以抗外來之侵略也·今日之中國。實處於興亡之歧途。若能幡然改悔。捐故道而就新路。則卽爲自强之機。國勢日急。固不容我人之好整以暇也。艾氏爲耶敎中人。其來華也。亦以宣揚耶敎爲使命。其所見我國之病症。旣如上述。其爲我所開之藥方。亦爲耶敎之藥方。耶敎入我國爲時雖久。然眞能認識耶敎之眞諦者。爲數仍寥寥無幾。就我人管窺所及。耶敎亦有耶敎之長處。（一）卽不以個人爲中心。（二）其道德以利他爲基礎。而與世俗之功利主義適處於相反之地位。若能認眞作去。未始不能稍革國人自私自利有我無人之風。此我人盼望國人對於艾迪氏之藥方。予以深切之估量也。</p>

<p>邱吉爾鮑爾溫各有主張</p>
<p>德國秘密引起國際疑懼</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英國樞密大臣鮑爾溫今日在下院辯論帝國防務時、言及德國重整軍備事、其言頗關重要、邱吉爾對於國會答覆英皇訓詞之文、動議修正、謂最近世界視綫集中之大事、爲德國之重整軍備、其陸軍固已整頓、海軍亦稍增建、而空軍之擴大、尤與英國有關、倫敦經一星期或十天不斷的轟擊、則死偒人民將達三四萬人、而逃入鄉者、不久將達三四百萬人、英國各處幾皆爲天空襲擊所可及、卽將兵工廠移至西海岸、亦無益也、在未有新發明時、國防唯一切實方法、在能以重大损傷加諸敵人、如敵人所能加諸英國者然、此乃自全之道、故渠主張在今後十年中以全力維持强大甚於德國之空軍、德人對於英國甚友好、現未有遽信德人將攻擊英國之理由、但在國社黨制度之下、祗須少數人决議、卽可驟然對英施攻、德國現遠反凡爾賽和約、擅練空軍、德國重整軍備之謎、必須揭破、一九三六年底德國空軍將比英國多百分之五十、而至一九三七年、則其空軍力量將倍於英國、英政府鞏固空軍之計畫、珠不充分、如英國本身力量逈不如人、安能干涉以維持歐洲和平云、</p>
<p>德國空軍力　鮑爾溫起而答稱、對德猜疑原因不一、而德國眞相、内則自守秘密、外則漫無所知、此亦其一因也、鮑爾溫言至此、乃追述過去一二年内自德國政局變更後、歐洲之政治發展、而尤注意於德國之退出國聯與軍縮會議、蓋以德國此舉、適在時局希望較前爲佳之時也、外間所傳關於德國空軍之説、大都言過其實、英政府無時不注視大局、目前未見</p>
<p>事變之氣象、如果事變發生、英國决不致毫無準備云、鮑爾溫駁邱吉爾之説、並謂德國空軍迅將與英國平等一説、實屬不確、德國今日所有之眞正空軍力量、不及英國百分之五十、英政府無論如何、决不願自處於視德遜色之地位、</p>
<p>英空軍計畫　鮑爾溫繼乃陳述英政府之空軍計畫、謂今後兩年内、擬編成空軍二十二隊、充國防之需、此外尙擬添置三隊、供艦隊之用、而今年所編空軍四隊、尙不在上述二十五隊之内、故一九三六年英國第一道防綫之空軍、較現有之八百八十架增多約二百架、輔助隊與特殊後備隊尙未計入、此外尙有充分飛機、以備補充、從今年七月起、當道考慮可作飛行塲之地點、不下九十處、已擇定十一處、現復着手增置設備、多儲人材明年四月間將新辦航空訓練學校增多短期服務之軍官、並羅致平民駕駛員列入後備隊、英國最新式飛機、其速度約每小時二百三十哩云、</p>
<p>勸德毌秘密　鮑爾溫最後發警闢牛動之詞、勸德國撤去其關於軍備之秘密、予人以共見、謂内部如何、外人知者殊鮮、此歐洲惶慮狀態之所由起也、實則德國所最依頼者、厥爲對於鄰國之友誼與商務耳、渠希望德國早日承認此種事態、揭開秘密之幕、而使歐洲所引以爲惶慮者、供人討論、庶吾人可知人所可爲者、將屬何事、如是、則德國可與其鄰國重開談判、而鄰國固無一不準備爲之助也、苟能如是、猜忌自不復發生云、鮑爾溫又稱、渠希望此番辯論、可導成趨向歐洲各國重行聯絡而發揮智慧和平的聲浪策一步驟云、</p>
<p>或有新局面　外相西門最後起立、結束辯論、謂英國對於國防問題、絶無意見參差之處、亦未有片面的軍縮之主張、鮑爾溫頃所發表之言論、其内容渠已預先通知德法意美四國、並附以詳細説明、蓋以此種議論、不僅與英德兩國有關也、此項通告、已成一種新進展、或可造成新局勢、未可知也、吾人目的、在以最低程序成立國際軍縮、吾人主張有節制的軍備限制、而反對無節制的軍備競爭云、辯論絡畢後、下院通過答復英皇訓詞之文、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　此間各報對於英國衆院之軍備辯論均作極顯著之記載、惟並未評論、僅一報評鮑爾溫對邱吉爾之答辭謂「吾等應告鮑爾溫、彼對德之鄭重言論、如從軍維事實方面觀之、實欠公允、因軍縮會議之破裂、其責在法而不在德也、當日討論此問題時、英國與德國之主張本趨一致、然法國忽於本年四月十七日提出文書、軍縮談判遂告終止、英國遂亦停止斡旋、鮑爾溫氏之演説對於英國前所主張之空軍公約未提隻字、而該項公約德國本應在其内、故鮑氏之對德呼籲實有欠妥處也、鮑爾溫氏囑德國對其演説之主題加以注意、而不必斷章取義、故吾等亦不必從字面上有所評駁、但有一事不能默爾者、卽吾等所求之軍備平等、何以未見論及、深盼鮑氏能顧及此點也云（二十九日國民電）</p>

<p>（莫斯科）　蘇聯共産黨中央委員會、自本月二十五日至二十八日舉行常年全會、討論取消麵包及其他物品之計口分配制、及改組國營農塲及機器曳引機站之政治部兩問題、並通過决議案數則、全會關於取銷麵包及其他物品計口授物劵制度之决議、其引言中稱、此項計口授糧劵制度於實行之始、乃屬必要、因當時小農生産尙佔優勢、其技術落後、其生産薄弱、而當時各個城市及工業區域對於食糧之需要日益增加、自第一届五年計劃實行以後、城市日漸發展、全國急劇工業化工農大衆境遇日佳、故其於麵包及其他産物之要求急激擴大、而此時農業生産决不能饜其所欲也、時至今日、大規模機器農業生産已經鞏固、國營及集體農塲已佔優勢、情勢已大起變化、蓋國家今日已有充分榖物、得用麵包自由制度供給國民、無須　用計口授糧制矣、此種舊制度目下必須取銷、蓋此對於蘇聯貿易之發展、亦爲重要之步驟、此項制度一經取銷、則兩種差别價格、（卽計口售價及普通售價）卽告消滅、同時國家得用一種單一價格、此項價格略爲現有普通出售高價及計口出售低價間之平均價格、唯如此辦法、麵包價格必相當提高、故中委會以爲職工之工資與薪金亦須相當增加、現　行集體農塲販賣條例仍予保留、唯須全力禁止麵包投機活動、全會决議辦法如下、</p>
<p>（一）自一九三五年一月一日起、取銷麵包麵粉及榖物之計口分授制度、由國營及合作社商店經營麵包及其他物品之普遍的自由買賣、（二）取銷現行麵包麵粉及榖物之零售價格、代以國定統一零售價格、（三）自一九三五年一月一日起、增加工資薪金獎學金及補助金、並訓令人民委員會决定此項增加之程度、（四）凡向國家供給農業原料之人民、前此亦用計口分配麵包制度、此項制度應予取銷、此後凡出售農業原料區域亦須實行買賣烤麵包制度、同時國家收買此等原料、須提高其價格、（五）對於飼料進行大規模之買賣、（六）若干國營及合作社商品須立加擴充從事麵包之出售、（七）擬訂如何將麵粉及榖物供給買賣機關之計劃、令各地麵包買賣得暢行無阻、國民需要盡能滿足、該决議案復稱、計口授糧制之取消、麵包買賣及國定一致而穩定之價格之實施、以及將來此等價格及工業品價格繼續抵减之可能、均令工農大衆之繁榮、得以繼續上升、此項辦法今日已屬可能、因集體農耕制度已告勝利、農業已有一般之發展矣、同時此項辦法、在蘇聯盧布幣制繼續加强及城鄉貿日益擴充之基礎之上、復能促成農工業之更大發展云、</p>
<p>全國會關於團營農塲及機器曳引機站政治部之决議案内、指明此等政治部之創設、乃欲解除黨於進行鄉區社會主義改造之門爭中所遇之困難、同時爲謀國營農塲及機器曳引機站在政治之上之鞏固、爲謀彼等對於鄉區所施政治作用之加强、並謀彼等政治與經濟工作之一般改進計、此等政治部之設立、亦屬必要、兩年以來、機器曳引機站設立政治部三·三六八所、國營農塲設立二·八○二一所、黨已愼重選派工作人員二萬五千人努力工作、消除其一切缺陷、其成續如何、可舉例説明之、如有多數積極集體農民原非黨員、今已團聚黨之周圍、努力奮鬥、反對階級敵人、保全集體農塲及國家之資産、並履行農民對於國家應盡之義務、一般反蘇維埃分子及集體農耕之敵人、原已混跡集體及國營農塲、從事破壞工作者、現時均已暴露、大部份已被驅逐、集</p>
<p>體農塲已成一種堅實而無敵之力量、彼已結合全國四分之三之農塲、其耕地面積佔全國百分之九十、兩年以來蘇聯農業已有曳引機一三七·○○○架、收割兩用機一八·○○○架、馬拖及曳引機播種機六三·○○○架、打榖機二四○○○架、各種收割機三四三·○○○架、及卡車二五·○○○輛、目下集體農塲共二四○○○○所、機器曳引機站共三·五○○所、國營農塲共五千所、彼等共有曳引機二八一·○○○架、收割兩用機三三·○○○架、卡車三四·○○○輛、馬拖及曳引機播種機八四五·○○○架、打殺機一二九○○○架、各種收割機二·○八五、○○○架、過去兩年内此等機器之工作遠勝於往昔、一九三三年曳引機耕地三千五百萬公頃、本年則爲五千五百萬公頃、上年收割兩用機收割作物五三三○○○公頃、本年則爲一·五七六、○○○公頃、本年春季播種之完成較上年早十五至二十四、本年收割工作遠勝往年、本年氣候雖劣、若干南部區域收成並不弱於上年、一九三四年榖物繳納計劃之完成較上年早六星期、集體農民現已堅决了解、彼等對於國家應盡之義務應首先履行、所謂爲波爾希維克集體農塲及集體農民幸福生活而奮鬥之口號、已深植集體農民心坎、彼等視此爲日常生活之一部份、且爲彼等實際工作之計劃、凡此均爲黨之正確政策及鄉區具體領導之急激改進之結果也、政治部者乃黨組織之特種形式、彼等以整個黨的實力與威權、以及機器曳引機站之經濟力量爲後盾、故於促進社會主義建設之落後部門（卽　農業）轉變爲前進部門之工作中、已有重要之成就、唯據經騐所示、鄉區政治領導方面問題叢生、故僅有政治部之存在、已感不足、今欲領導集體農場之整個工作、（政治、經濟、文化等方面）則正常的黨與蘇維埃之機關（料理行政經濟、文化、財政等之全部工作者）須予鞏固、中委會全會承認過去政治部之創設全部適宜、彼等於清算缺陷方面已起重要作用、同時决議如下、（一）機器曳引機站政部應改成通常黨的組織、並併入現有各區黨委員會、以完成上述目的、（二）各區面積如特别廣大、應分成若干新區、而將政治部併入、同時將對於各個初級黨組織之領導權、移歸各區黨委員會、（三）較大農業區域之區黨委員會除第一書記外、應設第二書記一人、（四）區黨委員會應設農業部、各機器耕種機站應設政治副主任一人、現　有政治部工作人員、全部留於各區工作、（五）訓令政治局、此項决議須於一九三五年三月一日澈底實行、（六）國營農場政治部制維持不變、决議案復稱、集體農場之經濟力量雖臻鞏固、唯其工作仍有缺點、一部份集體農場、仍有富裕分子混跡在内、其怠工現象尙未擊破、據本年繳榖經騐、因有階級敵人之怠工、故若干區域於收割、打榖及儲藏之際、曾遭巨大損失、同時有工作組織不佳、曳引機打榖機及兩用機運用不充分之現象、鄉區共黨黨員仍有患政治近視及工作懈怠之痛者、故此等階級敵人仍能活動如故、各區黨委員會應利用本届冬季、更進一步鞏固集體農場、團集黨外積極集體農民、改進集體農場董事會及主席之工作、加强集體農民集會之作用及價値、並令彼等團聚於黨之周圍云（二十九日塔斯電）</p>

<p>三界合作　關於羅賓生君指陳之第一點、委員會主席云、現在三個市政府機關、已在會商關於公衆運輸之合作方法、關於統計方法、羅賓生君云、可以派員在路上計數、或用特備之電機計數、或以一定速度攝取電影、警務處長云、自一九一九年以來、每年在界内十六處地點、紀錄車數一次、每次計行兩天、至製作交通圖、則工務處長云、如作圖以表示各項經過之車輛數目、並非難事、但難在如何表示各項車輛之關係、</p>
<p>交通法庭　旋討論及交通阻塞於一點、所及於他點之影響、衆意、如對於易致阻塞之點、加以統計、當有裨益、至關於違章處罰一層、在本界内欲專設一交通法庭、主管此事、曾經詳加考慮、係不可能之舉、</p>
<p>行事信號　對於各地點之放行及停進、如何使有系統一層、如欲施行、非設置高價之自動信號器不可、且在一條路上同時阻止横綫通車、在美國今已鮮有行之者、其變通辦法、則爲在一段頗長之路上、使車輛繼續進行無阻、但在上海、車式不同、又有人力車、施行殊難、或者可就各點交通燈之啟閉、加以精密的時間規定、惟無論施行何種方法、非詳細籌畫不可、旋警務處長云</p>
<p>、行車不易加快、多由於路綫之形式、及其狹窄、　　單方通車　羅賓生君繼述十年來管理交通工具之進展、並云、如施行一詳密的循環式、或單方通車制度、於上海必屬有益、工務處長云、推廣單方通車辦法、自極有益、但恐招致多數居民之反對、而不能實行、且對於汽車之便利、似已嫌過分注重、應對於公共汽車·電車·人力車·之便利、同樣考慮、蓋此數種乘客之數、遠過於坐</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>汽車之人、又午飯時間、太爲齊一、以致中午之擁擠、而私家汽車、長時停放路上、亦應加以注意、渠意現行建築章程、應加修正、務使造屋之家、多留空地、以供停車之用、嗣又有一建議、將單方通車辦法、行於若干馬路、但只限制汽車、不限制人力車、或推廣單方辦法於忙碌之時間據云、美國某處、試行單方通車、三個月後停止、商家均請求恢復、此制可認爲美事、旋某委員云、漢口路商家之經騐、則並不認此爲美事、　　公衆運輸　旋討論及交通管理、及其關係方面、認爲主要交通系統、必需靈活、方爲一般之利益、工務處長云、電車軌道之敷設、係適應以前情形、改鋪係屬困難、現今有軌電車、仍是多數人之廉價交通工具、至無軌電電、雖較爲活動、然後車不能超越前車、公共汽車比較靈活、優於電車、但行駛之開支較巨、裝用笛塞　發動機、本可節省開支、但進口税又甚巨也、</p>
<p>研究情形　關於任用一交通專家一節、續據羅賓生君陳述、如得此員、從事專門研究、當可利用現有之設備、而增便車輛之行駛、該專家自須先就本地情形、加以研究、方能進行改良計畫、某委員主張、此項專員、須永久任用、並與警務人員密切合作、</p>
<p>建議辦法　委員會經以上之討論、並致謝羅賓生君恊助之盛意、旋經議决、建議董事會、在警務處内、任用一合格之交通專員、但委員會主席同時聲明此項建議、對於現在警　務處交通股之人員、及其效能、並不含任何批評之意、</p>

<h3 id="c98">中國最近航業趨勢 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>招商局新造四海輪旨趣</p>
<p>航權旁落中一支生力軍</p>
<p>招商局新造四海輪、年内均可到滬、沿海航業可以充實噸位、在航運上實爲一支生力運、記者昨承該局總稽核李雲良氏、談述國内航業趨勢、與沿海長江外輪之勢力、航業亟謀合作之方案、頗極切要、特錄如下、</p>
<p>外輪雄厚</p>
<p>我國外海内河、僥有航運便利、惜已喧賓奪主、英旂商船一百餘艘、約二十六萬餘噸、集中於太古怡和等行、日旗商輪三十五艘、約七萬五千噸、爲日清大連大阪等會社所有、該三社臨時班輪尤倍之、美有捷江公司、法有聚福公司、兩共十二艘、約七千噸、總計在三十五萬噸以上、長江輪船十四萬噸、占我揚子江運輸十分之七、外海航綫、幾盡屬人有、年來收回航權、固盛唱一時、中日通商條約、中英馬凱條約、中美商約、均早到期、政府於被侵害之航權、應力爭自全者、然弱國無外交、能否達到航業自主、尙不可必也、</p>
<p>國輪衰老</p>
<p>查國有輪船、百噸以上者祗五百十二艘、合三十八萬毛噸、在世界噸位七千萬噸内所占成數、實微乎其微、其中登記總噸數在二千噸以上者、祗四十餘艘、招商局即占三分之一、平均船齡約三十四年、在最近十五年來新造之船、滿二千噸者、祗四艘、一千噸以上祗十艘、其他均係小型、而失事之輪、歲輒數見、新建者恐尙不敷抵補、至於年來總噸量、較前略增者、全係收買外商舊輪、年齡老朽、設備簡陋、行駛遲緩、致不能與外商爭雄、</p>
<p>招商奮起</p>
<p>長江航業、國輪與英日鼎足而三、海船則國輪在在落後、北洋有新盛京·新順天·南華綫有太原·濟南·等船、致國人旅行南北洋幹綫、仍須仰頼外輪、利權外溢、莫可奈何、招商局此次建造四海輪、亦會加以考慮、如以每艘一百三十萬元造價收購舊船、至少可買四五艘、惟爲復興沿海航業、充實近海幹綫、旣爲國家交通上迫切需要、不得專從一時利益上打算、故毅然向英國定建此四輪、一切營運計劃、因亦澈底革新、而貨客生意、尤頼國人贊助與政府維護也、今年年底、四船統可航行南洋路綫、得此一支生力軍、亦可爲中國航業、稍稍揚眉吐氣矣、</p>
<p>合作進行</p>
<p>今年三月、交通部召集全國航商、討論促進航業辦法、議案雖有二百餘件、其中最主要者、爲航業合作一案、由交部領導上海航業公會·國營招商局·合組中國航業合作設計委員會、六個月内、已將方案擬就、以後將着乎由航業界自動組設中國航業合作社、並先由各航綫自行分别聯合、政府加以監督維護、知現在之滬台滬揚滬津各路、使一盤散沙之航業界、迫於環境之需要、達到團結之精神、苟能因利勢導、予以獎進、除其暗礁、因我國船東除招商三北政記等數家外、餘極分散、管有一二船之公司、實居多數、平日競爭甚烈、排擠尤甚、運費猛</p>
<p>跌、粗貨水脚、甚有每担祗收七八分者、長此以往、將使國輪陷於悲慘之境、同遭消滅、故實行合作、爲挽救航業唯一途徑、由政府加以監督、以防壟斷之弊、如此、則航界之嚴重問題、亦漸可解决也、</p>

<p>第五回　諂笑逢迎挑燈照憔悴飢腸驅迫敷粉學風流</p>
<p>那胡小脚和你説話的時候，我在一邊聽到，你先生走後，我就埋怨他，有眼不識泰山。他説，並不是故意頂撞賈老爺。因爲當了許多人的面，賈老爺説了他好幾句，他若是不回嘴，怕有人笑他。賈多才道：當了人，他更是不該頂撞我。小紀道是呀，我也是這樣的説，何况老爺們説的話，那總是有道理的，他應當想想再回話讓我點破了他，他也就明白了，他説了，明天來和賈老爺陪罪。賈多才道：笑話，千萬不要來，我和這種人，還計較什麽是非不成？小紀輕輕的道：不是他一個人來，把那小姑娘也帶了來。賈多才這就禁不住笑了，因道：這就更不對了，那小姑娘又没有得罪我，爲什麽要他來陪不是。小紀笑道：説不過是這樣的説，賈老爺心裏，還有什麽不明白的。賈多才笑道：我告訴你，你們打錯了主意了。以爲我是銀行裏的人，一定有錢。你們不知道，銀行是人家開的，我不過在銀行裏辦事。小紀笑道：賈老爺，你説這話，我們可承當不起呀。我也是看到賈老爺很喜歡那姑娘的，我才敢這樣的説。若是你老爺一點意思都没有，那我們就是設局騙財了。賈多才見李士廉那裏，並没有朱月英，這完全是自已的誤會，對於胡嫂子，已是相當的諒解。現在説到朱月英會來陪禮，他更是心裏有些活動。便笑道：他們眞是要</p>
<p>來的話，我也攔阻不住。但是人多的時候，呌他們可不要來，要來，可要悄悄的。小紀道：請賈老爺自已規定一個時候罷，賈多才在身上掏出烟盒子來，取了一根烟捲，坐在椅子上偏了頭抽着。（七七）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>假定説：伊巡遊到半途上，忽然想起一件重要的軍國大事，要馬上寫一道懿旨的話，筆硯紙張，便可立刻送到伊面前去。再如伊的頭髮假定給風所吹散了，伊想趕快整理一整理的話，也祇須伊自已揮一揮手，或説一句話，伊的理髮匠｜也是一個太監，頗博太后的信任，當讚他是中國第一名高手的理髮匠。｜便立刻會捧着應用的工具，走上來侍候了。至於手巾，香粉，以及其他的各種化妝品等等，更是應有盡有，隨時隨地不難一索卽得。</p>
<p>『這裏有四座宫殿，是我們所不能不去看看的。』在大隊人馬的行進中，太后忽然向我們説話了，伊是向全體的人説的。但我總覺得伊是向我一個人説的；雖然我也知道這是一個妄想，可是我心上的確如此希望。因爲我記得很清楚，伊已經三番兩次的向我説過，待伊一旦去世之後，能够把伊個人的性情，人格，行爲以及日常的一切私生活轉告給全世界人知道的惟有我：所以伊極願讓我明瞭一切的眞相和實在，免得也跟外邊人一般的隔膜，誤會。伊對於我的希望是要我在將來把我實在所見到的説出去，不要加多一些，也不要减少一些。｜其時，伊又繼續給我們説明爲什麽那四座宫殿是不能錯過不進去的緣故。『這裏邊所藏着的便是我們清朝歷代帝皇所留下的遺物！』</p>
<p>伊果然把我們領進了那四座宫殿中去，因此，我們便知道這裏面一起是藏着八代帝皇的遺物。原來這個政治犯式的光緖皇帝已是清朝入關後的第九代的君主了。（一八七）</p>

<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>我亦曾附和着喊過『到鄉間去』的口號｜而我根本又是從鄉間來的；但我的足跡却很少踏到『故土』。所以遇到鄉間有人來上海看我，就會覺得異常親熱。</p>
<p>『算小』是鄉下人牢不可破的習性。我常常警告他們，在上海不比在鄉間，千萬算小不得。但他們居然會學行坐『揩油電車』的乖，結果是往往給查票的下令驅逐，苦着雙腿跑回來的！</p>
<p>他們以乎知道上海是出産『扒兒手』的地方，並且知道扒兒手準得揀着鄉下人欺，所以出門不敢多帶錢；就是『電車銅板』也得經過精密預算，剛够應付往返的車費。如果爲了想買些東西而順便在馬路上溜躂溜躂的話，他們的洋錢角子必得經過草紙新聞紙層疊的嚴密包紥，這纔裝進掛在小腹前面那只『肚帶』的底面。設使在電車上遇到那種歪戴着帽子油頭粉面的家伙，因而自已身畔覺得似乎有隻手在摸索他的肚帶的時候，他得下着極大决心趕忙下車，代個僻靜而『尿痕』狼藉的地方撒上泡尿，檢點一下有否失竊｜</p>
<p>説起他們的『肚帶』，我老呌它『乾坤袋』的。洋錢角子不用説，就是田單，房契，當票，旱烟盒，自來火，痧藥瓶，眼鏡匣都得擠在裏面凑熱鬧。困此鄉下人買了件東西，從乾坤袋中挖出錢包，打開層層包紥，所費手續和時間，眞够店夥煩厭｜</p>
<p>他們大都是羅斯福的信徒，主張『白銀政策』的，對於鈔票就不大歡迎。他們也有充分的理由。據説帶了洋錢進賭塲，縱使輸，决不致頃家蕩産的，因爲白花花的洋錢究竟捨不得狠命下注，不像鈔票一抛出去就是幾十塊那麽不學心痛｜再則每塊洋錢有七錢二分的銀子，疊起五十塊就有五寸長這麽一大段，在『觀摩』方面就比鈔票好得多，何况後者有時還有變成『花鈔』的危險!</p>

<h3 id="c171">播音小姐 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>自從收音機，成了一般高尙家庭中的恩物之後，播音事業，便有了驚人的發展。而同時呢，歌舞團的産生，也成了求過於供的局面，雖然在播音室裏，舞是絶對不需要的。於是播音小姐，遂成爲今日一般的女校高材生的偉大的出路，因爲任何一個播音的歌舞團中，是少不了幾位具有宛囀珠喉的女團員的。</p>
<p>當播音小姐，自然比了當給人摟抱的舞女，比了當給男演員玩弄的電影女演員都强，甚而至於比了當給人當作西施花瓶的女職員也强。因爲當播音小姐，只須在播音室裏歌唱二三闋·旣不露色，又中露相，更不會受到儇薄的紈袴的輕薄。而同時呢，所得的報酬，却比了裸了大腿，玩草裙舞的來得優厚。所以很有此大家閨秀，現在也加入了歌無團，當起播音小姐來了</p>
<p>但是話雖是這麽説，當播音小姐的，也未始不能絶對的與惡環境不相接觸。尤其是走了紅的播音小姐，更多加以誘惑者。我有一位親戚的女兒，在某歌舞團裏當播音小姐。據説每天至少可收到十封以上的情書，而更有用電話來約着去瞧電影，吃大菜的。伊對於情書，是每人覆一封印就的覆信。業於約着去玩的，倒不論識與不識，無不一口應承，不過去的時候，至少得約了三五位同伴去，使儇薄者，掏腰包請客之後。無所施其誘惑。</p>

<h3 id="c172">種菊小記 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 心仁</p>
<p>時序一到秋令，内心就像有點兒説不出的空虚，同時住在這一個祗有黄沙祗有烟灰的都市裏，除掉一些物質的炫耀以外，要想找一片綠色的樹葉作爲自然給我的一份慰藉，却猶如沙漠裏的找不到甘泉。於是想自已找一點花草來種一種，以資彌補這個缺陷的心念，便早存在着了，不過試騐了幾次，差不多是『屢試屢北。』受了敎訓，知道没有空地没有功夫就乾脆不要種花，免得出了芽便把那些小小的生命孤獨地枯死。不過最近搬了一次塲，房子的旁邊居然發現有兩尺多見方的𨻶地，再一看泥土也還肥黑，於是一�興到，又想試一試手段，種一些花草，一想便想到菊花了。跑到市間，有着成本的菊花在賣，下種現在本已不是時候，並且我也懶得焦待種子的萌芽，再逐漸地長成，所以市間的已經成本的菊花，恰恰合了鄙意，一連購下蓓蕾較多的幾棵，高興得一躍一跳地跑回來，好像一個孩子得着了可愛的玩物啦。</p>
<p>妻，本來也是很愛花草的，但是瞧見我抱着幾本菊花回來却冷諷了一句··『你這個傻瓜！我一時不瞭解這「傻瓜」的意義，凝注伊一會，然後伊又像解釋似的説··「哦！幾棵草菊，什麽名件？」但是接着又説··「菊花會謝呢，我要一棵不會謝的花。」</p>
<p>『世間那來不謝的花？也好像没有不老的人。』我説。</p>
<p>『你看！』妻便笑着指點鏡子，鏡旁挿了伊自已做的紙花，『那不是一些不會枯謝的花嗎？』我這時當眞才禁不得要笑妻的傻。因爲自製的紙花不是眞花也好比銅像石膏像的不是眞人一樣的假，同時假的花和假的人像祗是對於眞的一種憧憬與懷念，不是眞的存在。惟其是花會枯謝才顯得花的可貴，我們不覺得青春的易逝與人生的迫促嗎，我對妻説··「我們同去種吧，你才是眞傻呢。」</p>
<p>把幾本草菊種下之後，心中好像平添了許多的煩忙，每天一張開眼睛便去看一看菊花長了多少没有？比買來的時候增多一點活氣没有？每天傍晚的時候還要澆一次水，有時候還同了妻去看一看花蕾，推測它們開放的時日。因此每天在這些花葉上所得的愉快眞不是化掉購買時用去了幾個錢所能買得來的。甚至我還能想到一個花圃的園丁比到一個花圃的主人要多耽許多心，但也多得許多花所給人的愉快的。</p>
<p>但是時候過了半月，菊花依然跟買來的時候没有什麽不同，當初我還以爲每天去跟菊見面，不容易看出不同來，因此便决定，隔兩天去看一次，隔兩天看菊，菊還是那麽着，並且有兩本已經快要活不成的樣子，我心中自然不免要難過一陣子，但同時我已發現了菊花所以傷命的原因，是在這屋旁十分陰濕的緣故上，這裏太陽不被鄰居的高房子遮掩了，到正午才有一點亮，但也不過數十分鐘就完了，我不禁要爲菊的命運而嘆氣，但也明白『菊花是不會開放在没有太陽的人家的。』</p>
<p>關於這，妻好像又找到了伊的哲學的根據説··『你種的花是不興的，開了也會謝，是什麽名件？祗有我做的紙花，那才是永遠不會謝呢。』</p>
<p>但當時我心中的傷　却並不在花的謝與不謝上。</p>

<p>昨日粉市、大致堅　、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好八分一角不等、坎拿大好一二角左右、并以本月份之回籠　單、廠方微有收回、而北路各帮、則續有現貨交易、因此近遠期人心、步見穩固、本月份雖交割在邇、進出亦仍熱閙、遠期各月份、因廠出有限、外行心思亦仍良好、同時帶振一二分左右、迨至上午開盤、初仍平穩、旋以本月份聞有大批回籠交進、在洋拆大昂之時、套頭又少、故見逐步鬆落、遠期以浮多出檔、小廠亦見抛售、各月份較上午回去一分、較前日則仍好近分也、結果本月份不動、十二月份好半分、一月份小二厘半、二月份好一分、三月份好七厘半、四月份好七厘半云、</p>
<p>期麥市面、並以國内麥市落令、交易已無發展之勢、故各盤出入、仍然稀少、惟以抛户不暢、價見挺住、至本月份已在交割中、聞交割者、已有三十餘車、大約總數在五十車左右、全部係廠方所去也、結果十二月份漲四分、一月份漲四分、二月份漲三分、三月份漲四分、現麥市面、高貨繼挺一二分、中次如常、開山東徐州麥三元九角、宿州海州麥三元八角六七分、計二千四百包、由福新申大辦去云、</p>
<p>芝加哥雜糧、以多頭之獲利了結、被收尙易以及阿根廷天氣不良、十二月期之脱售價、較五月期高六二五至七五、</p>

<p>河米續跌角許</p>
<p>（滬南）昨各帮來源興前相仿、共到四十來號、（貨共六千餘石、）市况初市猶　、形勢續清、各貨跌風殊猛、嗣有作客　市、頻有採取、青島帮包胃亦續進五六百包、漸見帶緊、當時現狀頗佳、結果以早市跌度過巨、尙難恢復原狀、各晚稻及厚粳等價續見修去角砠至角餘、杜洋尖　　來貨較稀、市見平平、陰元雖酒　動動、而零胃殊淡、卒落一二角耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各路到船二十餘號、河存二百二三十號、白粳少數同行十巧上棧、本街去胃比前略形活絡、羊杜埠客尖新白元陰元零胃仍滯、早薄稻清淡、市形折粳高料小近角、中次小一二角、薄稻早稻小角許、餘貨價形疲軟、</p>
<p>洋行續抛遠期西貢</p>
<p>西貢新到一船計二千五百噸</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况甚軟、現洋米立小一角至角半、因前定新到不絶、昨由揚子號輪裝到西貢一號米一千五百噸、又碎米一千噸、共計二萬六千包左右、且洋商求售尤勤、雅利洋行抛出三四月份一千噸、合義抛出一千五百噸、價祇五元○二三分、比之前市較小一角、盡由南市行家收入、現洋米以　日銀　奇緊、内地難有進胃、乃觀望不前、本街亦稍　　而已、全日祗開西貢　　各米八百六十七包、客秈到頭不絶、本客胃口亦呆、昨共計成交不到二千包、價亦各小一二角</p>
<p>黄豆祇小磨豆有市</p>
<p>昨日黄豆市氣仍屬呆定、各帮去路、因銀根關係、心思交易、漸見停手、故祇剩浙紹本街之小　胃口、計辦去漢口乍豆二千餘包、價自三元三角半至三元二角半、大連豆因連電報升、申存不厚、市價尙穩、昨開莊家屯大料豆四元三角、四平街豆四元、共成交三車、餘外均無市、</p>

<h3 id="c187">文學的感情 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 夏時</p>
<p>什麽是文學的感情？這問題，當我們一致地承認了感情是文學的特質這一前提後，似乎有重新提出來談談之必要。</p>
<p>感情，只是一個空洞的名詞。它本身是没有特定内容的；它的内容完全由於各人對於自已生活的感受力如何來决定。譬如：一張白紙，染上了紅色，便成爲紅紙，染上了黑色，便成爲黑紙。紅紙與黑紙，雖然同是紙，但因它們的色調不同，影響到人的視線，也就顯然不同了。感情也是這樣，哭是一種感情，笑又是一種感情，哭笑之間，却誰都知道有巨大的差别。而且，卽使同是哭，或同是笑，也不能認爲所表現的感情就是一樣，某些人見了要發笑的事，往往别些人見了會哭。因此，如果我們只是空泛地説感情是文學的要素，是非常不够的，我們應該進一步問：怎樣的一種感情才是文學的感情，怎樣的感情才能喚起讀者的同感。</p>
<p>有些人以爲文學的感情，是美的，超現實的。現實，只有殘酷，醜惡，架空的理想，才能配稱爲美，文學應該引人陶醉在非現實的理想生活裏。</p>
<p>這種説法，自然是不正確的。因爲他們根本把文學看成少數人的專利品，感情與現實生活割開。</p>
<p>文學旣是許多人的智識食糧，必然地文學的感情應該是一般人的感情，而且也只有這感情，才能引起同感。</p>
<p>所謂一般人的感情，並不是什麽架空的東西，乃是從他們的實生活中發生出來的。離開了實生活的感情，只是虚僞的感情。一個作者，倘要使他的作品具有豐富的感情，能深切地感動讀者，必須多多體騐生活，單從書本上是得不到辦法的。没有餓過肚皮的人决不會了解餓肚皮的痛苦，卽使憑着一點科學智識借文字表現出來，也不過等於太太們看到馬路上的乞丐，只管搖頭嘆氣，絲毫不會觸到他們苦處。拿辛克萊跟高爾基來比。辛克萊之終於只能爲一個旁觀的社會主義作家，就是因爲他並不是平民中的一個，他對於平民的生活完全陌生；至高爾基，本身便是一個流浪人，自然，他所表露在文學上的感情，便成爲眞實的感情，會使全世界讀者受到感動了。</p>
<p>當然，一般人的感情，也並不是單純的東西，不是整體的東西。他們的生活是複雜的，從生活産生的感情，也必然是複雜的。就在這裏，感情簡單地可以分成兩方面；消極的感情與積極的感情。同是遭遇着旱災，有的人要自殺，有的人却反會憤激起來想到求生存的别方面去。前者是舊社會殘留下來的武俠小説傳染給讀的感情，也就是這一種。這種感情，是有毒害的，如果文學的感情，是要滋補一般人向上的意志，便必然要把那些消極的有毒害的感情，從作品中肅清。</p>
<h3 id="c188">西貢岸上的新客衙（下） <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 辛爾</p>
<p>進到最後，是一個荒凉的空院，院中間是小石子砌成的天井。除了屋子和我們這些人之外，什麽也没有。這是什麽地方呢？就是專用來關新客的新客衙呵！人疲倦死了，就不顧地上汚髒，坐下去休息。但給這種荒凉悲慘的氣色襲得更不知怎樣才好。究竟是要把我們怎樣處置呢。這地方不就像牢監嗎｜相到這裏，想到故鄉，心裏不由不酸溜溜起來。望望半新舊的牆壁，和狼狽的同伴，垂頭喪氣的坐着。</p>
<p>還好是有個大窗，是朝着馬路的，窗上的鐵條中間的縫很大，從外面可以塞東西進去。窗外有許多安南婦人和華僑在探看着，許多華僑就是專來探看從故國來的人。從窗縫遞進許多食物。有人在説：</p>
<p>『危險，天這樣晏了，外國人不辦公，就要在新客衙過夜了！』</p>
<p>天呀，過夜｜怎樣過法呢，難道就坐在地上，餓着過夜，我老是憂鬱遲疑的。漸漸的，騷動略安了些，大家没法只好默坐着。没人送東西的，就遞角子到窗外街上買些包子麵包充飢，我的遲疑也動搖了，買了一大塊麵包，茫然在凖備過夜。人太多，不好意思哭。</p>
<p>竟竞就靜下去，灰白色的黄昏，接着夜來了。外國人很放心的讓這些中國人就躺在這兒過夜。這些人也就好好兒的過着這樣的夜，在異邦裏過着第一個夜。但不知多少人在黑暗暗中落淚，背鄉離井，番邦的黄金色的梦碰釘子了。</p>
<p>夜倒不十分冷，但蚊子太多了，糊亂的心事眞多，誰個能入睡呢。關在隔壁的婦人們抱着的孩子不住的哭着，哭得我們更加難受。地上透出冷凉凉的陰寒的氣味，不自禁有些顫抖。有的竟竞在發出哭聲，有的像婦人似的呢喃，有的呌着，嘆着。想着早上船入港時候的情形，更是凄楚萬分。</p>
<p>這些人安然忍受過了個夜，隔天他們又呌苦：</p>
<p>『天呀！今天是星期日，外國人又不辦公·』</p>
<p>新客衙内還是荒凉的躺着，裏面蠕動着這些中國人。好好兒的中國人啦，爲什麽一下子變成像囚犯一樣的人呢。我失望悔恨了！但有好此人們是緊咬着牙根忍受。</p>
<p>像一大堆蟲，蠕動着，在過着第二天和第二夜。多半只會伸動着手脚，不能説話似的。没有人來理我們這些人。像落在渺無人烟的沙漠裏，又似被囚在小牢内，没有人的自由。</p>
<p>星期日過了，第三天早上這堆狼狽極了的人，又被趕向附近一個大園子裏，那是新客衙官辦公的處所了。男女小孩又照舊混在一道。開始辦公的時候，人擁擠得如同搶金似的我。忍耐的等了許久，不能不恐慌了起來，也跟着大家擠上去，就被人們夾在中間擠進入羣中間：可是許久還没有擠進入辦公室的門，透不過氣，快要窒息｜，又仍擠出來。休息了許久，鼓起勇氣再擠上去，三翻五次，都被夾在中間窒煞了，喪氣的退回，有時擠到最前的人被安南人亂打，那擠着的一大堆人，就像堤崩下來似的；但過一會又擠攏上去。小孩就被踏得呌命。</p>
<p>最後怕等得太遲了會發生意外，就冒命擠進，幸好也夾在中間混進去。大辦公室裏有好多個白種人和安南人在辦公。但不曉得究是要先經過那一位的面前，看了許久，才跟人家上去。最初兩個是安南人和一個打手印的。到面前去老是呆着，不懂法國話和安南話，又没人告訴我，那怎辦呢。結果看人家手指夾着小角子，望在『身字紙』下低低呌角，角，我也跟着做，安南人才理你，給你把手續做了，入口紙呀，新字纸呀·入口紙約莫要十一元左右，『身字紙』是要三十多元，繳完錢，弄到紙，又需經過幾個地簽字，打手印也要角角。白種人是比安南人威風多了，他那目光是怕人，我像奴隷般不敢抬頭，目光更不敢迎上去。有一次弄不清要經過那位白種人的關口，所以也許是弄錯人了，那白種人不只不告訴我，粗大的脚，就把我踼倒了。這才比上天難呀｜旣没有説明，也不好詢問，呌我怎知道先過那個關口呢？外國人眞難以應付了。我倒在地上血快噴出來。有的十八九歲的少年，騙他説是十五六歲，想避免繳身税字（即人頭税）但白種人總要給他幾個耳光，打得他要命，才僥過他，或者無論如何不僥過。</p>
<p>站在辦公室内半點多鐘，我發昏了。昏糊的拿到了身字紙和入口紙之類，走出辦公室，淚滴下來！</p>
<p>爲什麽要到這裏來呢？揩去淚珠，問着自已。</p>
<p>出了西貢岸上的新客衙，全身麻木了，眼前昏黑地。脚酸手軟，連頭都抬不起來。</p>
<h3 id="c189">職業與志願 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 羅密</p>
<p>一個人總是從他自已的底　經過揀選</p>
<p>而默契着一種或不止一種他自已所願意做的事情的。可是一個人所做着的事情不一定就是他所願意做的那一種事情的。如果我們把一個人所做着的事情稱之爲職業，把一個人願意做的事情稱之爲事業的話，那麽我們可以説恐怕大多數的人都是在過着職業與事業分離的生活的吧！</p>
<p>這是我們見慣的事實：有的是只能在職業的餘暇，略略做一點自已所願意做的事情：有的是自已所願意做的事情一點也没有做，便把一生度完了；這眞是做現代人的一宗大悲哀｜至於過着事業與職業相吻合的生活的幸福者，大槪是稀有的吧？</p>
<p>本來我们做一種工作便是一種求生活力之發洩的事。生活力發洩到自已所願意做的工作上去，便覺欣喜；生活力發洩到並非自已所願意做的工作是去，便感痛苦。於是，緊身於距離自已所願意做的事很遙遠的職業中的現代人，都普遍地在喊着那由於深嘗職業味而感到的苦悶了｜</p>
<p>旣然過着職業與事業分離的生活是是痛</p>
<p>苦的，那麽爲什麽大多數人感到了這一點而仍然那樣生活着呢？旣然職業不就是他的事業，爲什麽不抛棄他的職業呢？這大槪可别爲兩種情形：第一，小部分的人是得不到他所願意做的事，以是不得已祇能求其次。如古代許多不得知於當道，便退而著書或息影山林的都是。第二，是大部分的人是爲着生存不得不就着與事業分離的職業，或者是姑且藉此等機會，或者想亽職業中去求得生存的保障後再去做他的事業，或者在職業的餘閒做他所願意做的事。這類人可説比比皆是。而其原因霱人有一個：便是環境使人願意做某種工作，却不給人以做某種工作的環境！</p>
<p>各人所就的職業，就正是各人所願意做的事業，換句話就是：各事人做着自已所願意做的工作，這樣的社會，終於會有一天合到來的吧｜至於，人類總是朝着這個方向努力着的吧，我想。</p>

<h3 id="c190">小旅舍生活的回憶 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>很清楚的記得，是在去年桂花正在盛開的季候，我曾有一個時期，流落在一處駐滿了軍隊的地方，我住在一個小旅舍裏候『差事』，日子是過得那麽長那麽蠢，本來是人地生疏，兼之我又窮，人窮了，朋友當然少，於是我每天總是獨個兒拖着長腿在清冷的街道上，在小山上，在田野間，踱着，做着白天的夢。是秋天，天是那麽高闊那麽蔚藍，有時天空中一陣鳥兒掠過，紫色的野花開在小溪畔上，悠悠的秋風拂過我的臉，使一個孤寂的旅人有時也會感到輕微的愉快！</p>
<p>在一個小旅舍裏生活了一個多月，於今，還給我以多量的回憶。那時候日子實在不容易挨過，人窮，有什麽方法來打發那些日子呢？於是憂鬱的因子就一天多似一天的佔據着我的心。一顆心，好像是整天放在油鍋煎那樣焦灼，日子一天天的過去，而『差事』也一天一天的渺茫，父親來信問我職業問題如何，我忍着痛寫了一封動人的信去騙父親，説職業不久就有了，那時的隱痛只有我自已了解。有一天，我病倒了，你想，一個人又窮，又流落，又病了，眞會把一個軟弱的人苦死，好在我是一個皆慣了苦難的旅人，而且病也不很重，一星期過去了，我恢復了原有的健康！</p>
<p>記得在病時一個深夜裏，小旅舍眞像古寺般的死與靜寂，一罩豆樣大的灰暗的油燈伴着我，我想起了兒時的一切，想起了近年來掙扎的血痕，更想起了渺茫的不來，我悲傷着，我落了一陣寂寞的淚｜流淚，是可恥的舉動，我曉得的。然而，我終於忍不住滴了，那酸的淚，那寂寞的淚｜·····</p>
<p>小旅舍的生活，没有嘗過的人是不曉得其中含有多量的人生意味的，我以前曾坐過牢，我覺得在小旅舍裏正如在牢獄中一樣，同是體騐人生最好的地方，到於今，我總忘却不了這地方給我的那豐富的智識。</p>
<p>在小旅舍裏，冷靜的時候像深山中的古寺，但熱鬧的時候，也有那些失意的流落者醉後的狂歌｜在灰暗色的壁上題滿了通俗的詩句，有怨天的，怨世的，怨命的，有消極的，頺廢的，浪漫的，··我澡經把這些詩句都抄在一本日記簿上，後來有一次事變中，在一個可紀念的地方失掉了，於今，將近一年了，我還是那麽地惋惜着！</p>
<p>過了一個多月的小旅舍的生活像過了一年多，這日子實在蠢得有點使人不相信，帶着焦灼的心等候『差事』來臨，而『差事』終於像一塊石頭沉落在大海裏似的永無半點音訊了，一位朋友來信對我説：『在這個社會上，你不會吹，又不會拍，你還要再訓練訓練你那没有餓慣的肚子啊！』</p>
<p>於是，我終於在一天早上，帶着一顆更徬徨的心離開了那個小旅舍，這時候的情感，學得是非常凄慘的。</p>

<p>— （ＪosephConrad著）吳向隅譯</p>
<p>海格波特船長從前是一個沿着陸地航海爲職業的水手。他是一個破産農夫幾個兒子中的一個，他去學習做水手，不久就做了船老大，以後他的海上生活都横直在沿海一帶度過去的。也許最初那是一個很困苦的生活；他從來没有喜歡這種生活過；他轉愛有着無數房屋的陸地，與聚居在火爐邊的過着安靜生活的人。許多水手都有理由的僧恨海上生活，但他的憎恨却完全是感情用事｜好像他的愛好比較安定的生活是幾代遺傳下來的一樣。</p>
<p>『許多人當他讓他們的孩子們去航海，並不曉得他讓他們的孩子們做了怎樣一種職業呀。』他這樣解釋作貝珊聽『正如把他們立即造成犯人一樣呀。』他不相信你對於海上生活會習慣下來。你的年齡愈增，對於這樣生活的憎恨愈甚。這是一個什麽職業呢，爲了這職業，你的一生中一半以上的時間你不會再踏進你的家門？你直接到海外去，你無法知道家有了什麽事發生。有人也許要想到他憎恨遠航；可是他所曾有的最遠的航行，也不過兩週的路途，在那次航行中，他大都的時間化在抛錨避免暴風雨上。一到他的妻子得着一座房屋及一些錢的遺産，可以過活後（從一個做煤炭　積下了一些的獨身的叔父得來），他好像脱離了苦役似的放棄駕駛『東海濱』的煤船的工作。就是經過了這幾年，他仍可以用他兩手的指頭計算出他離開英國的所有的日子。他從來没有曉得在海洋深處是怎樣情形。『我從來没有離開陸地八十尋（一尋六英尺）以外』，這是他的跨口。</p>
<p>貝珊·嘉维爾過去曾聽到這一切，他們小屋的前面，生長着短矮的黄槐：在夏天的午後，她常搬一張椅子放在草地上，坐下來縫袵。海格波特船長，穿着帆布衣服，支撑着一把剷。他每天在他的前面那塊小方地上掘。他每年都要把那塊地翻了又翻，但他却『在目前』不預備種植什麽。</p>
<p>他總要對貝珊，嘉維爾更明白地説：『我將一直不種什麽，除非等到我們的哈利明天未回來以後。』他聽到這樣希望的公式不知多少次，這常引起她的心中對於那痴心的老人的浮泛的憐憫。</p>

<h3 id="c192">逸性的磨煉 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>平常愛好活動的朋友們，不在我家花格門裏進出，已有兩個月了吧。是他們遺棄了我，還是我對他們發生厭惡？在自已却未嘗緻細思量過。從前，我是歡喜熱鬧的人，卽使是在睡眠的時候，亦要把那座雜聲怪重的四燈收音機開着，有時偶被家人們厭惡而偷偷地關掉，忽然間的寂靜會如澆一桶冷水般的，把剛憇息下來靈魂從陰冷的夢境中激回。寂寞與我，旣如冰炭的不能接近，自然，我不能生活在寂寞的境域中。然而，現在，却給我忍受了兩個月來的寂寞生活，這確實是反常的事態呢。</p>
<p>兩個月來的變態的結果，是｜收音機被遺棄在矮鋼床底下，報刻鐘的鈴子被拆掉，孩子們被禁止闖進我的室内，自已在寂寞中養成了優逸的性情。雖然，説話是人家的自由，遇到高聲我也要掀住自已的耳朶，『不是嗎，旣不是在競爭選舉的會塲上演説，亦不是在交易所拍板伸手的市塲上，那麽，這種劃破天空般的呼嘯並不需要呵！』是在心内暗暗的咒詛着。許多信件和請柬都被擱在鉛絲籃裏，想要回復的時候，腦子就隱隱作痛了：『這統是多餘的事呵，虚僞地在一張白紙上寫着數敷衍的欽慕和問候之類的字句。自已並没有一些建樹，偏僞受人家一番空洞的恭維，那不簡直是反面的侮辱嗎｜把金錢或禮物去交換人家的一頓酒菜，説着自已所不願説的俗套的應酬話，那就算是社交嗎？』我深切地厭惡着這點多餘的事呵。</p>
<p>於是，便成天價的躱在家裏。買了一隻小銅香爐，點着上等安息香，灰色古雅的烟味飄在靜默的雾圍裏，書橱子裏的精裝本和没有切遇邊的書籍的地位，已被天青色　　　　的棕色封面的綫裝書佔據了去，有着　樸的顔色和沉默的姿態。板壁上的人體畫的塗金堆花木框給頂替了的品件，是袁克文的中楷和吳昌碩的花島，沙發近旁的矮几上常有着一罐淡味的發達爾，一壼清芬的雨前茶，和一冊小品文選。書桌上有一個古樸的紅木盤，雜置着紫茄，紅椒，黄佛手，青皮橙···絶妙的而無富貴氣的案頭清供哪。在這裏是嗅不着名利的惡味的，可是，這里亦没有咖啡壼，板烟斗，提琴和五綫譜，這樣，朋友們不在我家花格門裏進出，已有爾個月了。</p>
<p>可是，我並不憎惡孤獨和寂寞，我並不承認自已頺唐没落的青年，我亦並不在摹仿什麽清高出俗的生活方程式，　我祗以爲這是一種逸必的磨煉，『人不能離開現實而生活，等於游魚不能離開流水一樣，魚是愛好清流而憎恨濁水的，那麽人爲什麽不能在清逸環境裏生活一些時日呢·』常這樣在青灰色的發達爾的烟圈裏冥思着，『人世的濁流中浮滿着虚僞，欺詐，各種不同樣的假面具，色情和名利的慾念，世紀病的傳染菌，克服不了的時候還是逃脱吧，這正是我磨煉的時期呢。』這樣，我就疏遠了愛好活動的朋友們了。</p>
<h3 id="c193">理髮漫話 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 羣英</p>
<p>自已是最懶於理髮，而上海的理髮匠是最善於巴結主顧的，在半小時候内可以做完的『生活』他一定像煞有介事的這裏那裏修之又修，剪之又剪，把你的頭顱作爲一件藝術品似的摩沙，賞鑒，往往延長到一小時以上是很普遍的。不過反過來説，自然有一部份的主顧喜歡練習靜坐的功夫，卽使化最高的代價也認爲很爲滿意的。恕我説句放肆的話，我們的女同胞就是這一部份主顧的代表者，她們甚至能够有一個終生最早起的紀錄，原因是爲了理髮。最近電湯風行據説時間要在二三小時以上，那你閉了眼睛想想，把頭髮用花綫吊住了，再通以電氣，這不是活活受罪。</p>
<p>但是在一個休假日子，旣没有朋友可以談心，又不願上電影院去，那要消遣這無聊的時間最好是上理髮店。</p>
<p>在你推開玻璃門的時候，就那樣熟烈地被店主人歡迎着，這種殷勤的招待在無論那一種交易中是找不出來的。待你坐到軟軟的理髮椅上，小學徒就擰上一把熱手巾，並送上一杯清茶，使人感到一種受寵若驚的餘味。於是掄到理髮匠的抵聲下問了，你自然可以點點頭表示你是理髮或修面，　那一種式樣之類，於是接過一疊授上來的小報，你可以隨意流覽，這裏都是你平時所没有注意的珍貴的材料，比之讀心愛的書是有另一種的風味的。</p>
<p>這樣時間是很快的過去了，在你不留意的時候，一件藝術作品早已彫作成功了，這時候你就感覺到最後的工作希望牠慢慢過去，最後的一刹那是値得可貴的呵｜甚至到你出門的時候，還有些依戀不捨呢。</p>
<p>如果不是這樣，你懶得什麽都喚不起的興趣，那是坐到理髮椅裏可以馬上閉起你的眼晴，迷迷糊糊的睡去，有時偶然被高聲驚過來，或者適巧門口的無綫電中奏出一個愛的曲子，覺得用耳朶聽是無論如何不够的，就使勁睜開眼來，這種似睡非睡的景况，卽使躺在席夢思的床上也是想像不出來的。</p>
<p>我是最懶於理髮的，然而相反地並不爲了懶於理髮而做了理髮店的常主顧，所以時常我告訴理髮匠『理髮』之後而</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>使他大大的驚奇這傢伙怎不知道『修面』</p>
<p>有同樣的結果呢！</p>
<p>是否與我抱同調的人太多，踏進理髮店往往常被先進者佔據了所有的座椅，這時候就感到微微遺憾。然而旣進了門，店主人是不肯輕易放過這個主顧的，他一定灣着腰，伸開手，一疊連聲的『請』，使你不好意思把最後的一步退回去，有時甚至聽見幾個同樣的聲音像誘惑似的説：『就好了』｜其實或者他們的工作剛開始呢。</p>
<p>他們在空地方是安置着一只長椅子的，那裏就堆着許許多多的小報，但是你一定不願意的翻它，而小學徒們授上來的熱毛巾及清茶，也並不覺得親熱，反而是一種壓迫似的。在這種塲合，一定要當機立斷，不管店主人的卑躬到若何態度，馬上退出門來掉頭不顧而去，到另一家理髮店去，或者可以有新的發見。</p>
<p>不過有許多人是不肯這樣做的，他們認定了一家理髮店，更有認定一個理髮匠的，這當然各有長處。因爲我没有這種經騐，從略。</p>
<h3 id="c194">風和塵 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 峯</p>
<p>｜｜北平印象錄之三</p>
<p>説到北平總不能不説説風和塵，好像風和塵和北平有很大的關聯似的。北平的風之大和塵之多，這原因大槪得推究到塞外：塞外是富於風沙的，木落的時候，風和沙便囂張起來了。</p>
<p>現在又正是這時候，塞外的狂風又捲進這個古城來。狂風帶來冰和雪的消息，掃盡了枯焦的葉，直至樹木只剩了光條迎着風顫：這樣，等到又一個春天來時，樹木由嫩黄而淡綠，狂風也　變成溫和的。</p>
<p>我喜歡在北方大平原裏看風捲着塵。記得天氣是深秋時候，我在西山住時，每聽到松枝搖出海潮般的聲浪。我便常常爬上山去，盡我的目力，望東南那一片灰色的平原：我抖着風，也像古松般的粗傲，在山巓上看平原裏的塵海｜那景和色眞是很渾雄的。近處很有些像</p>
<p>千軍萬馬在沙塲上搏鬥：遠處略顯着一點糢糊，那像夏日的大清早在山上看一條長河，長河上的霧，烟，和水氣，婉蜒地連成一條白的帶子；又像是百八十輛大車大平原裏走，由馬蹄和車輪捲起的灰塵，也是那麽蜿蜒的一條；然而這終没有近處的來得更渾雄，一片塵撲着一片塵，撲着，連成一片又去撲另外的一片，這就很有些像海浪，但海浪是没有那麽活潑的。我最愛萬叢塵中的第一片塵，牠很勇猛，很壯烈，牠是一往直前的，由牠我想起屈原的壯烈來：『來，吾導夫先路。』那聲勢眞是那樣的。那時，我會忘了我自已，我是一個勇武的將軍了，松濤鼓舞我，一層層的塵是我的後盾，我遠有什麽顧忌？那時的我的心情，眞有些與風塵俱化的意味了。一個人在那種境界裏是不會不壯烈起來的，雪萊的西風歌，大槪就是那樣作的，那狂風暴雨的情調，有如一個原始人對着大自然的震怒而忘了自已；北地的風和塵給過我這樣的印象。</p>
<p>我想，北地的風塵，終是有北地的風味的。吱兒｜｜吱兒｜｜像個速度十足的搶彈在空中尖呌那麽地，門窗隨而震動，發出轟轟然之聲，電綫抖擻着，布招噗噗地捲了起來，一個招牌被捲下地去，轟咚，又一捲，跑當街去了；這時候，北平是在灰中。街是蕭疎的，不爲生活所欺壓的人們，也許正在圍着烘烘的火爐，聽着風聲打發他們風塵中的日子，一開門，當面便撲來風和沙；出門去，帶回來的是一臉黑和一鼻子泥，這樣，風和塵是會被詛咒的。詛咒便詛咒，風和塵倒不會因而消滅下去，北平將永不與風塵隔絶，這因爲塞外還有的是風沙。這風和沙的渾雄和豪邁，造成了北方人的氣質。北地的風塵終是有北地的風味的。</p>

<p>— 惠士</p>
<p>隨旋風飛行，隨旋風飛行，隨旋風到東西南北去飄零：看哪｜落葉兒是這般身輕｜猶如空間一顆兩顆的埃塵。</p>
<p>唱着，唱着這多麽感傷的詞子，我抱着一顆難於彌縫的破碎之心，渡過綠水，掠過青山，由故鄉飄零到客地來。</p>
<p>夜來，西北風一陣緊一陣，像利箭似的吹着，樓頭的一切都是靜寂的，像罩上了一層嚴霜，陰沉，愁凄，在這寒風威迫着的冬之夜，撑着一邊創痛的肩，坐在幽暗的燈光下，死寂的樓頭，茫茫然的，祇有一隻小花貓伏在案上在用前爪摩面。</p>
<p>這是延續了幾個年頭而至今尙無完盡的我的流浪歲月的一鱗。我的心也悶鬱得和外圍的氣壓一般：凝神地冥想着，祇有斑斑的生的創痕，和永無間息懷思的憂傷，陣陣痛楚着我。</p>
<p>一想起過去長失敗的生涯，一想起茫然無歸此後的去途，是近來最難忍受的危難。也曾有着赴湯火而不辭前進的勇氣，也曾充着受鞭笞而不呌疼痛的硬漢；但是，無盡的命運的摧殘，和自已根性薄弱的靈魂，已使我連呻吟的力也已完全失却。</p>
<p>自從隱匿般的遯跡到這裏來，生活在一羣全無交涉的陌生人中，終日的生活，祗睡覺和看書，睡醒了看，看倦了又睡，這樣的也不知已過了幾多的日子。但是，没有多的覺可以讓我安睡，更没有多的書可以讓我飽看，在這萬分無奈的瞬間，唯一的慰救自已，祇有努力來吸引周遭的外物以舒適心神。</p>
<p>看慣了啊｜一切都默認得出了　汚濁狹窄的街，早上的小菜攤，下午的車輛行人，夜裏的路燈如豆，黑暗充溢整個宇宙。那座土地廟斑剥的紅牆頭，整天的關着門，狹弄角裏實個乞兒在捉着白虱，一切都是刻版地演出，呵｜人生，也是刻版的嗎？責任，義務，永遠刻版地過着了。</p>
<p>客地，客地的生活如此，如此，多枯燥，多無聊，一想起客地，就不免要聯想到故鄉，回故鄉去吧｜又要去問環境了。環境，故鄉，飄零，客地，整天的在腦膜傾軋着，得不到解答。</p>
<p>據説，人是有靈感的動物，但我祗覺得冷酷而已，卑鄙，虚僞，吹牛，拍馬，人生藝術四要素，我一件都不能，那所受的刑具當然也應該的了。不是嗎</p>
<h3 id="c197">生日 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>小三子孤獨地坐在門限上，靜靜地望着天上的雲彩。突然不遠的地方傳來了一陣爆竹聲把他的沉思驚醒了。好奇心與趕熱閙心的驅迫，他連忙向那放爆竹的地方趕去。幾個和自已差不多大小的孩子亂紛紛地在地上拾未爆的小鞭砲，他也擠了進去，也拾到了二三個。於是他想尋找爲什麽放鞭砲的理由。他睜大了眼睛從門口望進去，看見一張紅木的八仙桌上點着臂膊樣粗細的大紅燭，一注香在香爐中發烟。桌子上還擺着一桌很精美的菜肴。桌子前面還圍着繡着金花的桌幃。幾個人很快樂地在屋裏談笑。</p>
<p>他依舊不懂得爲什麽放鞭砲，他旁邊的一個拖鼻涕的小孩子告訴他那家的小少爺十歲生日，在敬神祭祖。他果然看見一個打扮得花花綠綠的小孩子在裏面跑來跑去，很快樂似的。他知道那就是和自已同年的小少爺了｜</p>
<p>他忽然像想到什麽，連忙問旁邊的那個孩子道：『今天是什麽日子？那孩子搖了搖頭。他又問别的小孩子，有一個告訴他説：『今天是十月十四日。』</p>
<p>十月十四｜這不禁使小三子發呆了｜他記得從前他的媽媽常常説起的，十月十四是自已的生日。那末今天就是他的生日了｜而且是十歲的生日呢｜和那位小少爺一樣的是十歲的生日呢｜</p>
<p>他低下了頭望了望手中的二三個小鞭砲，他想，『爲什麽我家裏不替我放鞭砲呢？』</p>
<p>他又彷彿記起了八歲那年的生日。他記得那一天是很快樂的，媽媽替他換了一套紅綠的花衣裳，並且還給了他五個銅子，在吃飯的時候，特爲下了碗麫給他吃，麫裏似乎記得還有一雙鷄蛋的哩｜那天媽並没呌他至外面去掏垃圾桶，任他在外面玩一天的。</p>
<p>他又想起了去年的生日。去年比前年壞一些，因爲媽媽病着。而且媽説爸爸的生意也丢掉了。雖没有麫吃，依舊給過他三個銅子的，並且也没到外面去拾破布條子。</p>
<p>然而今年｜他幾乎把生日都忘掉了｜非但没麫吃，連三個銅子都没有人給他了。因爲媽媽在今年三月裏死了。爸爸又娶了一個後娘來，幾乎天天打他駡他，連飯都不給吃飽。爸爸也和以前大不相同，對着他總没好氣，不像從前那樣的愛他了。所以生日也被自已遺忘掉，如果不是爲了一陣爆竹，他一定不會想起來的。</p>
<p>但是還是不要想起來的好｜想起來｜｜不知怎地，小三子覺得鼻頭有些酸溜溜的，胸口也似乎有東西壓着一樣的難過。</p>
<p>『爲什麽我的生日這樣的可憐呢？』他自已問着自已。抬起頭來望望門裏面，他暼見那位小少爺在吃着很好看的糕餅，一會兒又吃新鮮的水菓。這越使他覺得自已的悲哀了｜</p>
<p>他哭了｜淚水迷糊了他的眼睛，舉起沉重的脚向自已的家裏走，一面用袖子拭眼睛。</p>
<p>突然，他的右臉上挨了一下重重的敲打，接着又是一陣怒吼：</p>
<p>『不死的小鬼｜什麽時候了？還不去拾些東西來？死屍｜』</p>
<p>一只破籃子和一只竹鉗子丢在他的眼前。那一陣可怕的聲音早把他的淚嚇回去了。他連忙把籃子背在身上，提起鉗子，向外無目的的去着。</p>
<p>當他走到看不見家的時候，淚馬上又包圍了眼睛了｜</p>

<p>— 希白</p>
<p>天空這麽的晴明，顯露了碧青而純潔，游雲也不敢把潔凈的像處女般的聖潔的太空點汚。呀，是怎末好一個晴明的天空呀！</p>
<p>茫茫的海洋放開了它的歌喉，歌着那洪濤巨浪之歌，鼓起了平靜的水面化成了海原上的小丘和高崗。</p>
<p>破難的帆船被那失意了的舟子掉着櫓兒咿啞作響和着西北風嗚嗚悲鳴地沉吟。</p>
<p>自由的海鷗拍着了翅膀飛在天際，在那茫茫的海原上，在那破難的帆船的頭上，朝東了又朝西，朝南了又朝北。｜｜｜</p>
<p>呀，自由地飛着喲，忽而乘着了西風前進，俄而又翻轉了翅兒抗着西風翔騰，冲上了太空又降下海面而吻着了海面的高潮。</p>
<p>哦，自由的嘴舌可嘗出了那高潮底味兒怎樣？那不是血腥腥的臭味嗎？</p>
<p>呀，拍着了翅兒而雄呌｜爲什麽？是向這高潮示威，還是作那破難的帆船底哀悲的弔號？</p>
<p>啊啊，自由的雄呌驚破了海上的高漲，驚破了海上的波濤之歌聲，驚破了那破難的帆船咿啞和西風悲吟的哀调凄切的聲韻｜</p>
<p>那兒有無數威武耀揚的帝國的砲艦巡逡，啊，海鷗喲，爲什麽不鼓起翅兒飛到那兒去，去跟在那砲艦的後面作它的附庸，偏要在這兒繞着這破難的帆船盤桓而雄呌呢？呀，眞的要使這破難的帆船中底失意人從那迷曚的惡夢，眷戀着以往的光華的夢魔中驚醒｜</p>
<p>自由的海鷗負着了自由呐喊的歌聲｜｜哦，甦醒，起來跟着前進｜</p>
<p>海鷗鼓起了翼兒前進飛去，越過了這破難的帆船，跨過了海原上小丘和高崗似的波頭，作這破難的帆船底前鋒，作船兒的嚮導，領着這船兒前進。可是呵，這破難而垂危的船兒抵抗不着西風的狂猛，海原上的波濤挫折，終於不能趕上那海鷗的喲｜</p>
<p>海鷗的翼兒有了些乏了，但又雄呌怒呼起來了｜哦，這是一切的聲息俱停止了樣：波濤停止了高歌，西風停止了嗚嗚的哀調，船兒停止了咿啞的悲鳴｜呵，祗有，祗有這海原上，晴明的太空中底海鷗拍着它的翼兒啪啪作響，雄呌怒鳴的聲音驚醒一切做着惡夢的妈隸，打破了這沉危的，呻吟的一切低調｜</p>

<p>Kings Yun and De to Enter the Capital This Year</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Representatives of Kings Yun and De, Bu Ying Dalai, Chen Shaowu, and Xiao Zhenying, arrived in the capital on the morning of the 29th from Ping. Bu and Chen stayed at the offices in the capital for the various leagues and banners of Mongolia, and Xiao stayed at the new village in the mausoleum area. According to Chen, this trip to the capital is on behalf of Kings Yun and De, to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to thank him for his visit to the border areas last time, and for the warm words, and to request items. They will stay in the capital for about a week and then return north. The offices of the Mongolian leagues and banners in the capital received a telegram from Bailingmiao on the 29th, stating that King De had departed from the Yimeng on the 25th and returned to Bailingmiao, and would arrive within a few days. Su Guiqing, the captain, was sent to lead a team to greet him, and Pang Qin of the Mongolian Political Council was also dispatched.

<p>(Nanjing) Mongolian Political Committee Pastoral Affairs Director Bu Ying Dalai, Counselor Chen Shaowu, and member of the Ping Military Branch Committee Xiao Zhenying arrived in the capital on the morning of the 29th. According to Bu Ying, in the past, the central government was inevitably alienated from the situation in Mongolia. Recently, Chairman Chiang's northern tour was visited by King Yun and King De, who were deeply moved by the central government's goodwill. This time, we were sent south to thank the central government for its goodwill and to receive the items presented by the central government to Kings Yun and De. After completing the matter, we will return home. Committee member Xiao is familiar with the situation in Mongolia and will report everything to Chairman Chiang on this trip. Recently, King De returned to the league and encountered bandits on the way, but he has now safely arrived in Bailingmiao. Kings Yun and De are scheduled to come to Beijing before New Year's Day to meet with the central authorities, present a detailed plan for border governance, and make some requests.

<p>Changyuan Dike Closing Project</p>
<p>Kong Xiangrong's Remarks</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangrong, Director of the Labor Relief Group of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association, said that since the beginning of this month, the Changyuan dike closing project, the diversion of the Guantai dike, the closing of the mouths of various numbers on the Jiugu Road, the restoration of embankments, and the various projects such as water and drought sand in the Daniezhuang area have been carried out simultaneously. The closing is progressing smoothly, and the central government and Hebei Province have allocated the funds for the project, which have been remitted, and the special funds are stored and allocated at any time. The most important thing is the work of diverting the Guantai River. As of the 26th of this month, in addition to the completion of the entire earth dam project at Guantai West Station, the embankment has been built to a length of 53 zhang, the earth dam at the East Station has been built to a length of 11 zhang, and the eaves protection sweep has been built to a length of 14 zhang. The water depth at the mouth is 2.3 meters. Currently, the employees and laborers are concentrated on the East Dam to rush to build the eaves protection, and rush to build the rear retaining wall, working nervously for days, hoping to complete the closing within one month. The entire project is scheduled to be completed before the Lunar New Year, with the goal of not delaying the spring plowing next year.</p>
<p>(29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) For the dike closing project at the Changyuan breach, Hebei Province decided to close the Guantai ditch first within only 50 days. The ditch was formed this year when the Yellow River rose, connecting the Guantai settlement of Chenliu in Henan Province, causing the water to hit Changyuan. Now, it has been started and closed, first making the ditch dry, so as to contain the water, and other mouths will be closed next spring when it is warmer. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Oriental Travel Agency and Tourism Bureau Willing to Continue Running</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Ping-Shenyang through train, which is operated by the Oriental Travel Agency, has been in operation for almost five months. When the China Travel Agency accepted the commission from the Ministry of Railways, it was a trial operation for six months. Now that the Fang International Tourism Bureau is willing to continue running, the China Travel Agency also hopes that the trial operation will end as scheduled on December 31. It is said that the person in charge of the Oriental Travel Agency, Hirayama and Zhang Shuiqi</p>

<h3 id="e9">The League of Nations Opium Committee Meeting Concludes <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>General Opinion is Favorable to Our Country</p>
<p>Hoping for the Success of Our Country's Anti-Drug Plan</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Nineteenth Meeting of the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee concluded today. After the plenary session, the Chinese representative, Hu Shize, told the Central News Agency reporter that the committee paid close attention to the new regulations of the Chinese government's anti-drug plan. The committee's opinions can be divided into two factions: one faction is the representatives of countries with opium monopolies, who very much hope that China's ban on opium should also go through a monopoly method similar to that adopted by their governments, and they are unwilling to see China achieve it directly and immediately. The other faction is the representatives of countries that oppose monopolies and advocate strict prohibition of opium, such as the United States, Poland, and Spain. The Chinese government's position also belongs to this faction. The representatives of these countries are well aware of the difficulties facing the Chinese government, so they do not criticize the Chinese government's new plan, but hope that the Chinese government's anti-drug efforts will succeed, using facts as stronger than words. Generally speaking, the committee's general opinion is favorable to China. However, it is hoped that China will vigorously implement the new regulations, without any leniency, and implement them thoroughly in both letter and spirit, so as to gradually prohibit the purchase, consumption, and planting of opium within the specified time limit. It is expected that if the new plan can be effectively implemented, not only the people of North China will benefit, but even other countries that implement the monopoly system will also benefit. In the past, governments with various monopoly systems often used the excuse that smuggled opium entered their territories from China, so their monopoly policies could not be abolished. If China can ban opium in the future, smuggling will not occur, and these governments will lose their excuses. Moreover, when the Chinese government prohibits drugs, it can demonstrate to the world that the Chinese government's plan is indeed effective and that drugs can be prohibited. It should be known that if China wants to become a strong and powerful country in the international community, the first step is to crack down on drug manufacturing and drug abuse. The harm of drug abuse is even greater than any foreign aggression. It is hoped that the government will receive the support of public opinion and achieve the goal of banning drugs within the time limit. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Question from a Member of Parliament</p>
<p>(London) Recently, a movement advocating for the gradual recognition of "Manchukuo" has been discovered here. During today's meeting of the House of Commons, the remarks of Thomas, a Conservative Party member, also reflected this trend. Thomas asked Foreign Secretary Simon, stating that the League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly passed a resolution on February 24, 1933, deciding not to recognize "Manchukuo." Now that the existence of "Manchukuo" is a "fait accompli," is the British government prepared to request the League of Nations to cancel the aforementioned resolution to facilitate the country's export trade? Lord Privy Seal Eden replied on behalf of Simon, stating that "the government still faithfully adheres to the League of Nations' principle of 'non-recognition' of 'Manchukuo.' The government cannot make such a request to the League of Nations to cancel the previous resolution." (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e12">Thoughts on Dr. Eddy's Speech in Shanghai <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Heng</p>
<p>Dr. Eddy has come to China for the ninth time. Our country is in internal and external difficulties today, which is undeniable. However, Dr. Eddy said that China's hope is more present than ever. How can the Chinese people not be excited when they hear this? Mencius also said, "A country that has no external enemies will always perish." History is full of stories of nations rising from adversity. Dr. Eddy's words are indeed true.</p>
<p>However, Dr. Eddy also pointed out the source of the country's demise: the internal corruption of the Chinese people. If this is not eliminated, even without external enemies, the country will inevitably decline. Looking at the collapse of the Roman Empire, we can clearly understand that today's problems are not external, but internal. Dr. Eddy's observations are true, and we should be deeply vigilant.</p>
<p>An ancient sage said, "A country must first defeat itself before others defeat it," meaning that the demise of a country must have its internal causes. Dr. Eddy believes that the atmosphere of corruption, bribery, and abuse of power is solid evidence of China's self-defeat. Not only the backwardness of construction, the failure of governance, and the plight of the people's livelihood are all due to this corrupt atmosphere, but even the loss of the four northeastern provinces should be attributed to this.</p>
<p>We often feel that the source of our country's problems lies in selfishness, which coincides with Dr. Eddy's opinion. Precisely because of selfishness, the welfare of society and the country can be regarded as trivial, while personal interests are pursued by all means, fearing to lose them. This leads to endless instances of corruption, bribery, and abuse of power, while the arduous and dangerous work of saving the country is shunned and despised. Even in academia, the reason why China lacks great inventions today is due to this mindset. Moreover, slogans such as "Reviving the Countryside" and "Go to the People" have been repeated many times, but few people respond. Isn't this also because the Chinese people are full of selfishness? Today's young people are fond of fame and fortune, competing for personal gain, and unwilling to work hard in their duties. Politicians who are frustrated often complain and flatter the powerful, unwilling to sacrifice themselves. Are these not also due to the obstruction of personal honor and disgrace? In short, the Chinese people's problem today lies in selfishness, in regarding personal interests as the sole purpose, and treating everything else as a tool. In a country where the relationship between people is entirely based on self-interest, how can genuine emotions arise? Without genuine emotions, how can the driving force for uniting the nation be developed and increased? If the driving force of the nation cannot be developed and increased, how can it compete with strong neighbors in today's world?</p>
<p>Dr. Eddy also said that China's current national crisis is a warning to China. If this warning can be accepted, there is hope for revival. Otherwise, it will be like Korea. If it cannot eliminate its past ills, relieve the people's suffering, and develop the people's abilities, it will have no way to resist foreign aggression. Today's China is at a crossroads of rise and fall. If it can repent and turn from the old path to the new, it will be an opportunity for self-strengthening. The country's situation is urgent and does not allow us to relax. Dr. Eddy is a member of the Christian faith. His mission in China is also to spread Christianity. His observations of China's problems are as described above, and the prescription he prescribes is also the prescription of Christianity. Although Christianity has been in China for a long time, few people truly understand its essence. As far as we can see, Christianity also has its advantages: (1) It does not center on the individual. (2) Its morality is based on altruism and is opposed to the utilitarianism of the world. If it can be seriously implemented, it may be able to slightly change the Chinese people's selfishness and lack of consideration for others. This is why we hope that the Chinese people will give deep consideration to Dr. Eddy's prescription.</p>

<p>President's Two Daughters and Minister of War Also Among Enemy's Spoils</p>
<p>If This News Is True, Frontline Morale Will Plummet</p>
<p>(New York) Bolivian President Dr. Salamanca was recently defeated by Paraguayan forces, and he personally went to the Gran Chaco region to replace senior commanders. According to a dispatch from La Paz, Salamanca, his two daughters, the newly elected President Dr. Tejada, and Minister of War General Herzog were all captured by Paraguayan forces. If this news is true, Bolivian army morale will plummet. Details are currently unknown, probably due to strict censorship imposed by the La Paz authorities after the incident. It is unknown from which source this news first reached La Paz. It is generally believed that it must be based on something, because if this kind of unfavorable news were not true, no Bolivian side would have transmitted it to La Paz. Dr. Salamanca took office in 1931 and will complete his term in March 1935. His successor, Dr. Tejada, was recently elected and is now also a prisoner. The Bolivian president is effectively the commander-in-chief of the army, so the Paraguayan army's capture of him is unprecedented in modern warfare history. The capture of the Minister of War is also a rare "prize." It is expected that Paraguay will detain these people as hostages to achieve its demands. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>Britain Actively Plans Air Defense</p>
<p>Baldwin Expresses Confidence</p>
<p>Hoping Germany Can Cooperate Harmoniously</p>
<p>Simon's New Developments in Mind</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons' debate on imperial defense reached its climax today. After Churchill discussed Germany's preparedness for war while Britain was unprepared, Lord President of the Council Baldwin spoke, vaguely requesting Germany to return to the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. Baldwin stated that "if Germany remains isolated and does not directly communicate with other European countries, the suspicion of all countries will increase, and Germany's difficulties will only worsen." Baldwin also stated that the British government is currently conducting a detailed study of Britain's air defense, and a four-year plan to expand air defense has been drafted and will be announced next year. According to Baldwin, although the British Air Ministry claims that there is currently no reason to panic, it has planned to increase the number of aircraft produced next year by 80-90% compared to this year. Baldwin later stated that the four-year plan may be shortened due to the urgent situation in Europe, and if so, additional funding may be allocated before the end of this year to complete the plan within two years. Baldwin also announced for the first time today the British government's official estimate of Germany's army and air force strength, which is approximately between 600 and 1,000 aircraft. Baldwin also said that Germany is also urgently developing airfields, but the construction situation and location of these airfields are kept strictly secret. Baldwin denied that Germany would soon be equal to Britain's air force strength, but said that although Britain is not in immediate danger, it must take precautions so as not to be completely unprepared in unforeseen circumstances, because the situation is indeed very serious. Therefore, the government has long been paying attention to it and will continue to pay attention to future developments. In any case, the government will never be willing to fall behind Germany's future air force. It is generally believed that Baldwin's mention of Germany and the League of Nations is an implied invitation for Germany to return to the League of Nations. When Baldwin mentioned international panic, he said, "If Germany had not left the League of Nations, and if Germany had not taken a mysterious attitude towards its military actions, this panic would not have occurred." Baldwin later assured Parliament that the government is paying close attention to all developments, and finally added an optimistic tone, saying, "Even in this most chaotic moment, I have not completely given up hope for disarmament." Political observers believe that Baldwin's tone was very peaceful. His failure to mention the Treaty of Versailles may be intended to allow Hitler to propose new disarmament conditions. After Churchill's and Baldwin's speeches today, airline stocks on the stock exchange suddenly rose. (National News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e15">Parliament Debates Military Affairs <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Churchill and Baldwin Have Their Own Opinions</p>
<p>German Secrecy Arouses International Suspicion</p>
<p>(London) When British Lord President of the Council Baldwin spoke in the House of Commons today during a debate on imperial defense, his remarks regarding Germany's rearmament were of great importance. Churchill moved an amendment to the parliamentary reply to the King's speech, stating that the recent major event that has captured the world's attention is Germany's rearmament. Its army has been reorganized, its navy has also been slightly increased, and its air force has been expanded, which is particularly relevant to Britain. London will be subjected to constant bombardment for a week or ten days, and 30,000 to 40,000 people will die or be injured, and 3 to 4 million people will flee to the countryside. Almost all parts of Britain are accessible to aerial attacks. Even moving arsenals to the west coast would be useless. In the absence of new inventions, the only effective method of national defense is to inflict significant damage on the enemy, as the enemy can inflict on Britain. This is the way to self-preservation. Therefore, he advocates maintaining an air force in the next ten years that is stronger than Germany's with all its might. The Germans are very friendly to Britain, and there is currently no reason to believe that the Germans will attack Britain, but under the National Socialist system, only a few people need to make a decision to suddenly attack Britain. Germany is currently violating the Treaty of Versailles, privately training its air force. The mystery of Germany's rearmament must be revealed. By the end of 1936, Germany's air force will be 50% larger than Britain's, and by 1937, its air force strength will be double that of Britain's. The British government's plan to strengthen its air force is inadequate. If Britain's own strength is far inferior to others, how can it intervene to maintain European peace?</p>
<p>German Air Force Strength Baldwin rose to reply, stating that there are various reasons for suspicion of Germany, and one of them is that Germany keeps its internal affairs secret and little is known to the outside world. Baldwin then recounted the political developments in Europe in the past one or two years since the change in the German political situation, and paid particular attention to Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, because Germany's move came at a time when the situation was hoped to be better than before. The rumors circulating about the German air force are mostly exaggerated. The British government is always paying attention to the overall situation, and no signs of an incident are currently seen. If an incident occurs, Britain will definitely not be unprepared.</p>
<p>Baldwin refuted Churchill's statement and said that the claim that the German air force would soon be equal to Britain's is inaccurate. The true air force strength that Germany possesses today is less than 50% of Britain's. The British government will never be willing to place itself in a position inferior to Germany's.</p>
<p>British Air Force Plan Baldwin then elaborated on the British government's air force plan, stating that within the next two years, it plans to form 22 air force squadrons to meet the needs of national defense. In addition, it plans to add three squadrons for use by the fleet, and the four air force squadrons formed this year are not included in the above-mentioned 25 squadrons. Therefore, in 1936, the air force on the first line of defense in Britain will increase by approximately 200 aircraft compared to the existing 880 aircraft. Auxiliary squadrons and special reserve squadrons are not included in the count. In addition, there are sufficient aircraft for replenishment. Since July of this year, the authorities have considered no less than 90 locations that can be used as airfields, and have selected 11 locations. They are now working to add equipment, store more talent, and open new aviation training schools next April to increase the number of officers serving short terms and recruit civilian pilots into the reserve squadrons. The speed of Britain's newest aircraft is approximately 230 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Advise Germany Not to Be Secretive Baldwin finally issued a startling statement, advising Germany to remove its secrecy regarding armaments and give people a common view, saying that outsiders know very little about what is inside, which is the reason for Europe's state of anxiety. In fact, what Germany relies on most is friendship and commerce with its neighbors. He hoped that Germany would recognize this situation soon, lift the veil of secrecy, and allow what Europe is worried about to be discussed, so that we can know what can be done. If so, Germany can reopen negotiations with its neighbors, and none of its neighbors are not prepared to help. If this is possible, suspicion will no longer arise. Baldwin also said that he hoped that this debate could lead to a step towards re-establishing contact between European countries and developing wise and peaceful voices.</p>
<p>Perhaps There Is a New Situation Foreign Secretary Simon finally rose to conclude the debate, stating that Britain has no differences of opinion on the issue of national defense, nor does it advocate unilateral disarmament. He had previously notified Germany, France, Italy, and the United States of the content of Baldwin's remarks, and attached a detailed explanation, because this kind of discussion is not only related to Britain and Germany. This notification has become a new development, which may create a new situation, but it is not known. Our goal is to establish international disarmament at the lowest level. We advocate moderate arms limitations and oppose unrestrained arms competition. After the debate concluded, the House of Commons passed the reply to the King's speech. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The newspapers here have all given prominent coverage to the arms debate in the British House of Commons, but have not commented. Only one newspaper commented on Baldwin's reply to Churchill, saying, "We should tell Baldwin that his solemn remarks to Germany are not fair from the perspective of military facts, because the blame for the breakdown of the Disarmament Conference lies with France, not Germany. When discussing this issue that day, the positions of Britain and Germany were close to being aligned, but France suddenly submitted a document on April 17 of this year, and the disarmament negotiations came to an end. Britain also stopped mediating. Baldwin's speech did not mention a word about the British-proposed air force convention, which Germany should have been a part of, so Baldwin's call to Germany is inappropriate. Baldwin instructed Germany to pay attention to the theme of his speech and not to take it out of context, so we do not need to criticize it on the basis of the words, but there is one thing that cannot be ignored, that is, why is the equality of armaments that we seek not mentioned? We sincerely hope that Baldwin can take this into account." (National News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>The Failure of the Powers to Act Jointly</p>
<p>Has Created a Situation of Japanese Domination</p>
<p>Our Country Must Reorganize Internally</p>
<p>(London) The famous British wartime Prime Minister Lloyd George, who has not spoken in the House of Commons for more than a year, declared today that China's territorial integrity must be maintained in spirit and in letter, and said that he has studied in detail all the developments in the Far East, acknowledging that Japan has difficulty finding new markets for its products. However, the secret to Japan's success lies not in competition but in cooperation. All countries in the world must treat Japan equally, but there is no need to give it preferential treatment, so as not to close the gateway to the Chinese Sea. China must reorganize internally and develop its resources to assist various countries in achieving this goal, because all countries' dealings with China must be based on the principle of equality. (National News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Liberal Party leader Lloyd George continued to speak, explaining the world situation and mentioning China and Japan, saying that if China could get foreign financial assistance, it could proceed and increase its purchasing power fourfold. As for Japan's difficulties, they cannot be ignored, but we should tell them that the Chinese Sea is not a closed sea. China's integrity and independence must be fully restored in letter and spirit. The world must help China to restore its order and develop its great resources. All countries' actions towards China must be completely equal to each other. At present, due to the lack of joint action between the powers, Japan has given China the impression of being the only one. He believed that if Britain had adopted a clear and practical policy with other countries, this situation would change. There are plenty of solutions in the Pacific Ocean that are not only friendly to Japan but also beneficial to Japan, so that Japan will no longer have the idea of adding armaments and increasing burdens.

<h3 id="e17">Soviet New Economic Policy Restored <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Abolishing the System of Rationing by Headcount</p>
<p>Free Buying and Selling at State-Fixed Prices</p>
<p>Reorganization of Political Departments in Collective Farms</p>
<p>(Moscow) Since 1929, Soviet Russia has implemented a rationing system as part of the Five-Year Plan, requiring all people to purchase bread and other daily necessities with ration coupons. Today, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, during a meeting, passed a resolution proposing to petition the People's Committee to abolish this system. If successful, Russia will revert to the New Economic Policy of 1921, when the first attempt to implement pure communism failed, and private trade was partially restored. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party held its annual plenary session from the 25th to the 28th of this month, discussing two issues: the abolition of the rationing system for bread and other goods, and the reorganization of the political departments in state-owned farms and machine tractor stations. Several resolutions were passed. The introduction to the resolution on abolishing the system of rationing bread and other goods stated that this system was necessary at the beginning because small-scale agricultural production still dominated, with backward technology and weak productivity, while the demand for food in cities and industrial areas was increasing daily. Since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, cities have developed rapidly, national industrialization has progressed quickly, and the living conditions of the workers and peasants have improved daily, leading to a sharp increase in their demand for bread and other products, which agricultural production could not satisfy at the time. Now, large-scale mechanized agricultural production has been consolidated, and state-owned and collective farms have gained dominance, leading to a significant change in the situation. The state now has sufficient grain to supply the people with a free bread system, without the need for rationing. This old system must be abolished, as it is an important step in the development of Soviet trade. Once this system is abolished, the two different prices (i.e., the rationed price and the ordinary price) will disappear, and the state will use a single price, which will be roughly the average between the existing high ordinary selling price and the low rationed selling price. However, this method will inevitably raise the price of bread significantly, so the Central Committee believes that the wages and salaries of workers should also be increased accordingly. The current regulations for collective farms selling goods will be retained, but all efforts must be made to prohibit bread speculation. The resolutions passed by the plenary session are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) From January 1, 1935, abolish the system of rationing bread, flour, and grain, and allow state-owned and cooperative stores to engage in general free buying and selling of bread and other goods. (2) Abolish the current retail prices of bread, flour, and grain, and replace them with state-fixed unified retail prices. (3) From January 1, 1935, increase wages, salaries, scholarships, and subsidies, and instruct the People's Committee to determine the extent of this increase. (4) People who previously used the rationing system for bread when supplying agricultural raw materials to the state should have this system abolished. In the future, areas selling agricultural raw materials must also implement a bread-buying system, and the state must increase the prices at which it purchases these raw materials. (5) Conduct large-scale trading of feed. (6) Some state-owned and cooperative commodities must be expanded immediately to engage in the sale of bread. (7) Formulate a plan for how to supply flour and grain to trading agencies, so that bread trading can proceed smoothly everywhere, and the needs of the people can be fully met. The resolution further stated that the abolition of rationing, the implementation of bread trading and state-fixed consistent and stable prices, and the future possibility of continuing to reduce these prices and the prices of industrial products, will allow the prosperity of the workers and peasants to continue to rise. This method is now possible because the collective farming system has triumphed, and agriculture has generally developed. At the same time, this method, based on the continued strengthening of the Soviet ruble currency system and the increasing expansion of trade between cities and villages, can further promote the greater development of agriculture and industry.</p>
<p>The resolution of the National Congress on the political departments of collective farms and machine tractor stations indicated that the establishment of these political departments was intended to resolve the difficulties encountered by the Party in carrying out the socialist transformation of rural areas. At the same time, it was also necessary to consolidate the political position of state-owned farms and machine tractor stations, to strengthen their political role in rural areas, and to generally improve their political and economic work. In the past two years, 3,368 political departments have been established in machine tractor stations, and 2,8021 in state-owned farms. The Party has carefully selected 25,000 staff members to work hard and eliminate all their shortcomings. The results can be illustrated by examples, such as the fact that many active collective farmers who were not previously Party members have now gathered around the Party, striving to fight against class enemies, preserve the assets of collective farms and the state, and fulfill the obligations that farmers should fulfill to the state. In general, anti-Soviet elements and enemies of collective farming who had infiltrated collective and state-owned farms to engage in sabotage have now been exposed, and most have been expelled. Collective farms have become a solid and invincible force, and they have integrated three-quarters of the farms in the country, with their cultivated area accounting for 90% of the country's total. In the past two years, Soviet agriculture has had 137,000 tractors, 18,000 combine harvesters, 63,000 horse-drawn and tractor-drawn seeders, 24,000 threshing machines, 343,000 various harvesting machines, and 25,000 trucks. At present, there are a total of 240,000 collective farms, 3,500 machine tractor stations, and 5,000 state-owned farms. They have a total of 281,000 tractors, 33,000 combine harvesters, 34,000 trucks, 845,000 horse-drawn and tractor-drawn seeders, 129,000 threshing machines, and 2,085,000 various harvesting machines. In the past two years, the work of these machines has been far better than in the past. In 1933, tractors cultivated 35 million hectares of land, while this year it is 55 million hectares. Last year, combine harvesters harvested 533,000 hectares of crops, while this year it is 1,576,000 hectares. The completion of spring sowing this year was 15 to 24 days earlier than last year. The harvesting work this year is far better than in previous years. Although the weather this year is poor, the harvest in some southern regions is no weaker than last year. The completion of the grain payment plan in 1934 was six weeks earlier than last year. Collective farmers now firmly understand that their obligations to the state should be fulfilled first. The slogan of striving for the happiness of Bolshevik collective farms and collective farmers has been deeply rooted in the hearts of collective farmers, and they regard it as a part of their daily lives and as a plan for their actual work. All of this is the result of the Party's correct policies and the rapid improvement of concrete leadership in rural areas. Political departments are a special form of Party organization. They are backed by the entire strength and authority of the Party and the economic power of machine tractor stations. Therefore, they have made important achievements in promoting the transformation of backward sectors of socialist construction (i.e., agriculture) into advanced sectors. However, according to experience, there are many problems in rural political leadership, so the existence of political departments alone is not enough. Now, in order to lead the entire work of collective farms (political, economic, cultural, etc.), normal Party and Soviet organs (which handle all administrative, economic, cultural, and financial work) must be consolidated. The Central Committee plenum recognized that the establishment of political departments in the past was entirely appropriate, and they have played an important role in clearing up shortcomings. At the same time, it resolved as follows: (1) The political departments of machine tractor stations should be transformed into ordinary Party organizations and incorporated into the existing district Party committees to achieve the above-mentioned goals. (2) If the area of each district is particularly large, it should be divided into several new districts, and the political departments should be incorporated. At the same time, the leadership of each primary Party organization should be transferred to the district Party committees. (3) In addition to the first secretary, the district Party committees in larger agricultural areas should have a second secretary. (4) The district Party committees should have an agricultural department, and each machine tractor station should have a deputy director for political affairs. All existing staff members of the political departments should remain in the districts to work. (5) Instruct the Politburo to thoroughly implement this resolution by March 1, 1935. (6) The system of political departments in state-owned farms should remain unchanged. The resolution further stated that although the economic strength of collective farms has been consolidated, there are still shortcomings in their work. A portion of collective farms still have wealthy elements mixed in, and their phenomena of sabotage have not yet been broken. According to the experience of grain payment this year, due to the sabotage of class enemies, some areas suffered huge losses during harvesting, threshing, and storage. At the same time, there are phenomena of poor work organization and insufficient utilization of tractors, threshing machines, and combine harvesters. Rural Communist Party members still suffer from political myopia and lax work habits, so these class enemies can still operate as usual. The district Party committees should use this winter to further consolidate collective farms, unite active collective farmers who are not Party members, improve the work of collective farm boards and chairmen, strengthen the role and value of collective farmers' meetings, and unite them around the Party.

<h3 id="e18">Yugoslavia's Memorandum to the League of Nations <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Proving Hungary's Collusion with Terrorist Groups</p>
<p>Responsible for the Marseille Assassination</p>
<p>(Geneva) On the 22nd of this month, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić submitted an application to the League of Nations Council regarding the issue of political responsibility for the Marseille assassination, requesting the Executive Yuan to handle the case. Tonight, the Yugoslav Permanent Representative to the League of Nations, Fotitch, submitted a memorandum to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, strongly proving that Hungarian officials colluded with terrorists (i.e., the Ustaše, an organization formed by Croatian exiles). It is claimed that when the terrorists began their activities, they were personally trained by Hungarian army officers. Some terrorists were housed in the Fries Barracks in Békés, Hungary, until 1931. Afterward, Hungary established several training centers, the most famous of which was organized by Béla Székászi in Jankapuszta (near the Hungarian border with Yugoslavia). The recruitment, selection, and training of terrorists were all conducted within Hungary, and the Hungarian authorities facilitated the terrorists' possession of a large amount of military equipment and explosives. The memorandum pointed out that when the perpetrators of the Marseille assassination left Hungary, their passports were issued by the Hungarian authorities, and that the Ustaše printed its own currency, and its members wore uniforms and practiced openly. This was also acknowledged by Hungary in its note verbale of April 26 this year. The origin of the group's substantial funds must be thoroughly investigated. The memorandum went on to detail how the Yugoslav government had requested Hungary through diplomatic channels to stop the activities of terrorists, but the Hungarian government had consistently evaded the issue. The memorandum concluded by stating, "The Hungarian government bears a heavy responsibility. The Yugoslav government believes that it is an international duty of the utmost importance to reveal this to the highest international organization" (i.e., the League of Nations). (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After Yugoslavia's documents to the League of Nations were published, the Hungarian delegation immediately announced Hungary's position on the matter to international journalists. They first stated that the Hungarian delegation had not yet had the opportunity to formally respond to Yugoslavia's accusations, but generally and firmly denied them. The Hungarian government's response did not address each point, but only pointed out that Yugoslavia's actions were aimed at defaming Hungary's reputation. The claim in the Yugoslav memorandum that the Hungarian government was involved in the Marseille assassination was entirely fabricated. Hungary had no prior knowledge of the matter, and the perpetrators did not forcibly reside in Hungary. The Bulgarian government initially stated that the perpetrators came to Hungary from Bulgaria, but then retracted this statement. It is true that three people lived in Hungary before the Marseille tragedy, but the other perpetrators all came from other countries. The instigator of the case was not within Hungary. The Hungarian government has repeatedly notified the Yugoslav government of the situation in Jankapuszta. Hungary has also notified the League of Nations that the Hungarian government has been working since last spring to expel the Croatian outlaws in the area. However, although the area is called a "den," it is actually just a village with only 30 to 40 Croatian emigrants hiding there, but it was cleared on October 1. The Yugoslav government's request is no longer an issue, so there should be no further unfavorable actions against Hungary. This is what Hungary finds regrettable. (Guomin, 29th)</p>

<p>Japan to Propose New Plan</p>
<p>Content Accompanied by Numerical Explanations</p>
<p>(London) It is expected that Japan will propose a new plan, or a revised version of the original plan, which will be the second step in the London Naval Talks. Japanese representative Yamamoto stated yesterday during a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Simon that he now has a new plan. It is reported that it contains detailed technical explanations and is accompanied by figures to demonstrate how Japan's original plan for equality and total tonnage can be compatible with Britain's suggestions for qualitative restrictions, not building defensive engineering construction on Pacific territories, and mutually notifying shipbuilding procedures. This plan is expected to be formally presented at the next meeting between British and Japanese representatives at the end of this week. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Simon will visit US Chief Representative Davis. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tomorrow's meeting of the British-Japanese Expert Committee is the key to opening the naval preparatory talks. Japanese representative Rear Admiral Yamamoto plans to submit a new proposal at or immediately after the meeting. The main content is as follows: (1) Warships are divided into two major types: battleships, aircraft carriers, and Class A cruisers (10,000 tons, armed with 8-inch guns) are offensive weapons; Class B cruisers (10,000 tons, armed with 6-inch guns), destroyers, and submarines are defensive weapons. All aircraft carriers, offensive weapons, must be completely abolished. Battleships and Class A cruisers must be thoroughly reduced. The number and tonnage of various offensive warships must be required to be equal. Each country determines its common limit for defensive weapons, and within that limit, it is free to build various warships. (2) The overall maximum limit of offensive and defensive weapons that each country should possess is a common maximum limit. This limit should be reduced as much as possible to lighten the burden on the people as scheduled, realize mutual non-aggression, and achieve the purpose of disarmament. (Jiji, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese delegation notified the British-Japanese Expert Committee on the 27th that it would adjourn on the 30th. As a result of the meeting on the 28th and 29th to discuss the response policy, it was decided to begin discussing numerical issues in order to advance the preparatory talks. Therefore, future talks will focus on negotiating numerical issues. (Jiji, 29th)</p>

<p>Vincent Issues Declaration</p>
<p>(Washington) House Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Vincent declared today that if Japan insists on tearing up the naval treaty, Congress will allocate funds to prepare to build five ships for every three ships Japan builds. He personally will be the mover of this case and will request the necessary funds from Congress to implement this policy. We can ignore how Britain feels, but the United States cannot recognize US-Japanese naval equality because the area of territory that the United States must protect is larger than that of Japan. This would be tantamount to placing Japan in a superior position, and even at the cost of sacrificing the treaty, the United States cannot recognize Japan's naval equality. It is hoped that the Washington and London Treaties can remain effective. Americans certainly do not want a naval competition because taxpayers bear a heavy burden, and a huge navy is harmful to world peace, and the World War has already proven that the cost of armament is far less than the cost of war. It is reported that Vincent is one of the proposers of the Vincent-Trammell most superior naval bill. The House Naval Affairs Committee will demand to maintain the 5:5:3 naval ratio, and Vincent hopes that Japan can voluntarily withdraw its demand for equality. Vincent stated that if Japan insists on equality by threatening to break the treaty, the United States has no other choice but to maintain the 5:5:3 ratio in fact, that is, the United States builds five ships for every three ships Japan builds. Vincent also said that when the Washington and London Treaties were signed, Japan thought the ratio system was fair and accepted it, but now it considers this treaty unfair, shameful, and dangerous, and it is unknown what to make of it.

<h3 id="e24">Westminster Abbey Royal Wedding <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>London was full of dignitaries and the public scrambled to watch</p>
<p>Distinguished guests' attire was colorful and dazzling</p>
<p>The grand occasion was unprecedented since the coronation of the British monarch</p>
<p>(London) The gathering in London of monarchs and royalty from various countries to celebrate the marriage of British Prince Duke of Kent was an unprecedented spectacle since the coronation of King George. Among them were King Haakon VII of Norway and Queen Maud, King Christian X of Denmark and Queen Louise, Prince Paul, Regent of Yugoslavia, and countless others from all over the country eager to witness the event. People began to gather along the route the newlyweds would travel from midnight onwards, and the crowds grew larger and larger after dawn. Roofs and windows were filled with people, and specially built viewing platforms were even more crowded. At 10:36 this morning, the Queen, accompanied by the Queen Mother, left Buckingham Palace in a specially designed carriage with large windows, leading the royal family. The crowd waiting outside the palace cheered wildly. The carriage was pulled by two chestnut-colored high-stepping horses, escorted by a guard cavalry. The carriages carrying other members of the royal family were also drawn by teams of two chestnut horses each.</p>
<p>Three groups of people went to Westminster Abbey this morning. The first group was the King and Queen of England. The second group was the bridegroom, the Duke of Kent, also in a carriage drawn by two chestnut horses, departing from St. James's Palace, accompanied by his brother, the Duke of York, and the Crown Prince, as his groomsmen. The third group was the bride, Princess Marina, escorted by her father, Prince Nicholas. The bride had a joyful expression, wearing a silver dress adorned with roses, the national flower of England. She wore a diamond tiara, covered by a veil, and carried a bouquet of white lilies. Her attendants all wore scarlet uniforms with gold trim. Their hair and wigs were dyed, making them dazzling. Along the route, sailors, marines, and guards from Scotland, Ireland, and Wales stood respectfully, commanded by Lieutenant General Gallant.</p>
<p>Westminster Abbey was filled with dignitaries. Male guests wore formal attire according to their rank, while female guests competed to be the most beautiful. The splendor of their attire was difficult to describe. The robes of the bishops were also noticed. The eight bridesmaids were particularly dazzling.</p>
<p>At 11:00 a.m., the ceremony began. As the bride slowly entered the hall, the choir sang loudly. The Bishop of Westminster introduced the guests to the bride and groom, followed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. After the introductions, hymns were sung and prayers were offered. Then, the Archbishop delivered a sermon, followed by more hymns and prayers. Finally, the national anthem was sung and the wedding march was played. The ceremony was elaborate and solemn, with orderly movements.</p>
<p>After the ceremony at Westminster Abbey, the bride and groom rode in a carriage to Buckingham Palace. The crowds along the streets cheered, their voices reaching over a mile away. The King and Queen of England also returned to the palace. The newlyweds then attended a Greek Orthodox wedding ceremony in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace, officiated by Germanos, the Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church in London. It was also quiet and orderly. The newlyweds exchanged vows and rings. Those participating in the ceremony included members of the British royal family and royalty from foreign countries who came to offer their congratulations. After the ceremony, the newlyweds attended a wedding banquet at Buckingham Palace. Later, at 3:30 p.m., they rode in a carriage drawn by famous horses to Paddington Station. Along the way, crowds were still densely packed to watch. At 4:20 p.m., the newlyweds took a five-carriage royal train to Birmingham, arriving safely at 6:20 p.m. They then proceeded by car to Himley Hall, where they plan to spend part of their honeymoon.</p>
<p>Today, King George, the Crown Prince, and the groom all wore naval uniforms. The groom arrived at Westminster Abbey first, while the bride was late. The groom looked anxious. The Crown Prince also seemed uneasy about it. However, when the bride arrived, the groom's face lit up. The bride entered the hall, escorted by her father, in a silver wedding dress that sparkled brilliantly. The train of her dress was twelve feet long. She bowed her head and slowly walked to the altar. When the "obey" clause was used during the wedding ceremony, the bride's reply of "I will" was soft and gentle, only audible to those in the front row. The groom answered in a clear and firm voice. When the groom took off his wedding ring and placed it on the bride's finger, the hall was silent. At 11:14 a.m., the Archbishop declared the bride and groom husband and wife. Then, the wedding bells rang loudly.</p>
<p>The Queen watched the wedding ceremony with her hands clasped, deeply moved, and frequently wiped away tears with a handkerchief. The Crown Prince gazed at the printed wedding program. After the bride and groom completed the ceremony, they appeared extremely happy. As they stepped down from the altar, the groom turned back and whispered a few words to the bride. As the King and Queen of England exited the church, they repeatedly bowed to the cheering crowd. At 11:50 a.m., the wedding ceremony was completed. The newlyweds then left the hall amidst cheers and boarded their carriage. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) During the British prince's wedding, the police managed street traffic in a very thoughtful manner. The city was divided into three zones, one of which stretched from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey. From 8:00 this morning until the wedding ceremony, vehicles were generally not allowed to enter or exit except for those with special passes. According to foreign dispatches received by Reuters today, the radio broadcast of the prince's wedding was heard clearly in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.

<p>Hankou Correspondence: The military campaign against bandits in the five provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei has come to an end since the Jiangxi bandits fled west. The National Government specifically ordered the abolition of the General Headquarters of the East, West, South, and North Routes, as well as the General Headquarters of the Reserve Army, on the 27th. Gu Zhutong and Chiang Ting-wen were appointed as the Pacification Directors of Jiangxi and Fujian, respectively.

The original telegram is as follows: "Now that the remnants of the Jiangnan bandits have fled west and there are few scattered bandits left in the original bandit areas, it is imperative to redeploy forces to pursue and suppress them separately, with the aim of eradicating them as soon as possible. In addition to appointing He Jian as the Commander-in-Chief of the bandit suppression forces, leading the troops in Hunan, as well as the Xue and Zhou units, and the bandit suppression troops of various provinces, to pursue and block them separately, with the aim of annihilating them, the various bandit nests in Jiangxi and Fujian that have not yet been recovered must be recovered by the end of November, and fortifications must be completed.

<h3 id="e73">Hankou Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance to Strive for Cash Transportation to Hankou <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Financial Disturbances Throughout the City; Relief Efforts Are Difficult to Alleviate</p>
<p>Also Requests the Headquarters to Advocate for the Shipping of Huai Salt by Steamship</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the Ministry of Finance issued a new order restricting the transportation of cash to Xiamen, Shantou, Qingdao, Hankou, and other ports, a major disturbance has occurred in the Hankou market. The Shanghai notes have plummeted, requiring a surcharge of over 17 yuan per thousand yuan. Discount rates have also increased sharply. Financial institutions throughout the city are in a state of panic, and other businesses are also greatly affected. The Hankou General Chamber of Commerce, believing that this matter is of great importance to the prosperity of commerce, sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance on the 27th, requesting the swift transportation of cash for relief. The telegram reads: "To Minister Kong [Xiangxi] of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: The Ministry's new order stipulates that cash transported to Xiamen, Shantou, Qingdao, Hankou, and other ports must be accompanied by passports. The news has caused panic throughout the city. Shanghai exchange rates have plummeted in recent days, and discount rates have risen sharply. At a time when local products are entering the market, the need for cash is particularly urgent. With the source restricted and circulation impeded, any delay in timing could lead to unforeseen changes. Shanghai and Shanghai are closely interconnected, and the impact will be indescribable. We earnestly request the Ministry to carefully consider the pros and cons and promptly order the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to transport a large amount of cash to Hankou. If other commercial banks and money shops are required to obtain passports, the procedures should be simplified to provide relief and avert the crisis. Respectfully submitted, anxiously awaiting." Furthermore, the issue of Huai salt transportation is also a focal point of the dispute between the Hankou business community and the Ministry of Finance. Since Huai salt began to be transported by steamship, there has been the benefit of lower prices and faster speeds. Recently, in order to take into account the unemployed boatmen of Twelve Forts, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Hubei salt merchants to switch to sail transport, which is not only more expensive but also takes longer and has a significant impact on people's livelihoods. The Chamber of Commerce has already cabled the Ministry to vigorously advocate for steamship transport. On the 28th, they also submitted a petition to the General Headquarters of the Three Provinces for bandit suppression, stating: "Human evolution has reached a point today where everything is moving towards lightness, efficiency, and convenience. As far as water transport is concerned, after the advent of steamships, sailing ships have lost their importance in transportation. To reverse this trend is to go against the tide and will not be tolerated by the times. Now, the salt authorities, in order to meet the demands of the fort residents, have ordered the transport merchants to switch to sail transport. By analogy, all steamship transport would be taken away from sailing ships. If we only consider the partial livelihood of the sailing ship owners, we must prohibit steamship transport altogether, which is absolutely impossible given the circumstances. Moreover, salt is a necessity for the people's livelihood, and steamship transport is more convenient and can reduce costs, thereby benefiting the people, which is a fact that cannot be concealed. We respectfully request Your Excellency to investigate and promptly telegram the Ministry of Finance to implement this request in order to emphasize the people's livelihood and maintain salt transport."

<p>Opium Paste Shops Opening One After Another</p>
<p>The county's Anti-Opium Committee has approved the business licenses of the Gongji and Jinji opium paste shops, as well as eight opium paste shops such as Taili, with the autonomous region as their business scope. The Gongji opium shop is assigned to the Pubei area, and the Jinji shop specializes in the Punan districts. The opium shops have all been announced to be established, and their first batch of 10,000 liang of opium paste has been distributed to the opium paste shops in various districts for sale. It is about to be sold out, and preparations are being made to fill out the second consignment note to transport opium from the nine counties. However, the total consumption of opium by licensed smokers is used as the amount of opium paste sold by each opium paste shop, which is said to be less than one-third. According to people in the opium paste industry, official sales are not smooth, which is due to the activity of private opium. They will find ways to petition the county association to strictly prohibit it in order to maintain the prohibition policy.</p>

<p>Provincial Committee Secretly Investigates Private Opium Dens in Wuxi</p>
<p>No. 26, Yushan Chuanbang, North Gate, the Jiang's brothel, is a famous family of Ronghu pleasure boats, and the prostitution industry is at its peak. First, there was the famous courtesan A Feng, whose beauty rivaled the moon and whose reputation was unique. She was chosen by the people of the time as one of the Four Vajras, and she was also good at drinking, with the reputation of being a big drinker. When A Feng got married, she was replaced by "Feng Bao", whose eyes were bright and beautiful, and whose beauty was natural. Since the prohibition of prostitution, the brothel has relied on the patronage of regular customers, coupled with the popularity of pleasure boat cooking, so its livelihood is still not bad. Currently, there are three young prostitutes: Feng Zhu, Pan Di, and Xiu Bao (i.e., Xue Xue). Recently, the Provincial Anti-Opium Committee sent personnel to Wuxi to secretly investigate private opium smoking and selling, which was very strict. It was found that the Jiang's brothel was providing opium for people to smoke, and it was reported to the County Anti-Opium Committee, which notified the Public Security Bureau. At about 12:00 on the previous night, the police were dispatched to search the Jiang's residence and seized three opium pipes, two opium lamps, a large jar of opium paste, several decks of cards, and a copy of Jiang's opium prohibition license, and arrested the madam Jiang Qiu (Da A Sao), the prostitutes Jiang Huiying (Pan Di), Jiang Lianying (Feng Zhu), Wang Yunxing (Xiu Bao), the maid Wang Meixiu, the female servant Li Qian, and the boatman Yang Dongsheng, and took them to the bureau for interrogation and detention by the County Anti-Opium Committee. At the same time, the bureau also arrested Du Pan Gen at No. 9, Gengdu Bridge, South Gate, Zhao Ren Gen at No. 66, North Chang Street, Tang Huifen at Huilong Bridge, Shao A Qiao at No. 11, Huntang Lane, North Gate, Gu Zhou and Gu San Da at No. 12, Cao Zhang and Zhao Zhang at No. 19, Xiaosifang Lane, Zhang Hu, Zhu A Yuan, Li A Da, Chen Tingjing, and Jiang Qingping in the Malu District, Guo Hui, Cao Hua, Wu Zhao, Du Mingyuan, Li A Bao, Su A Gen, and Shen Zhongchu in Zhongzheng Road, and Wu Rongda, Xue Yonghe, Ji A Bing, Zhang Wang, and Liu Wang at No. 16, Jiulong Lane, and took them to the bureau for interrogation and detention.</p>

<p>World Crisis Is Inevitable; We Must Struggle to Save Ourselves</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, National Government Member Wang Zhengting recently went to Nanjing to attend the National Government meeting and pay respects to Chairman Chiang. After completing his official business, he returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. Wang told reporters who visited him yesterday morning that he had gone to Nanjing this time not only to pay respects to Chairman Chiang but also to attend the National Government meeting. He had also met Wang Liangchou, who had arrived earlier. It is reported that Wang's meetings with Wang [Jingwei], Chiang, and other gentlemen were very satisfactory. Wang is scheduled to leave Nanjing for Shanghai within a day or two and then take a ship south again, so the prospects for peace are very optimistic. Regarding the joint telegram from President Wang and Chairman Chiang to the Japanese League, the points listed therein, such as defining the powers of the central and local governments, are indeed essential at present, and I fully support them, because true national unification and peace cannot be achieved without such provisions. Wang then talked about the arms reduction conference held by Britain, the United States, and Japan in London, expressing his deep feeling that these countries are fighting too hard for their rights and will be difficult to succeed, so the future of the conference is very pessimistic. If the great war of 1935 and 1936, as rumored outside, unfortunately breaks out, our country will probably be difficult to maintain neutrality and will inevitably be drawn into the vortex. Therefore, I deeply hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will urgently catch up, first of all, with sincere unity at home, and at the same time, plan for production and education, so that we can cope with the difficulties. As for our country's desire to seek diplomatic alliances, we must follow the will of the Premier and unite with the nations in the world that treat us equally, struggle together, and strive for self-salvation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association's proposal for the reduction of prison sentences and amnesty for prisoners, which was resolved by the Central Political Conference of the National Government at its 369th meeting on August 9 of last year, has not yet been implemented for more than a year. Yesterday (the 29th), the association specially telegraphed the National Government, requesting that an amnesty be promulgated immediately. The original telegram is recorded below: "To the National Government of Nanjing: It has been more than a year since the Central Political Conference resolved the proposal for the reduction of prison sentences and amnesty for prisoners at its 369th meeting on August 9 of last year, but it has not yet been promulgated. The people of the whole country are eagerly awaiting it. At a time when the country is suffering from frequent disasters, it is appropriate to promulgate an amnesty in order to appeal to Heaven and relieve the prisoners. Therefore, we telegraphically request the government to review and approve it, and to promulgate a reduction of sentences and general amnesty immediately in order to appease public expectations. The Shanghai Lawyers Association respectfully submits, anxiously awaiting."</p>

<p>The Rumor of the Shanghai-Xinjiang Line Changing Course Is Absolutely False</p>
<p>The Beiping-Guangdong-Ningxia-Baotou Line Operates as Usual</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Li Jingcong, General Manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, was summoned by Chairman Chiang the day before yesterday to give instructions on the company's business. After completing his official business, Li took the night express train to Shanghai the day before yesterday and flew to Beiping at 7:30 AM yesterday. According to Cha Zhenhu, Secretary of the company, the rumor that the Shanghai-Xinjiang line was changing course was absolutely false, as it was not such an easy matter. The Beiping-Guangdong line is still operating as usual. The extension of the Ningxia-Baotou line was originally a test, and no new developments have been seen in terms of business. Li flew to Beiping because his mother was seriously ill and he was going to visit her.</p>
<h3 id="e88">French Concession Levies Inspection Fees <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Mechanical Industries Association Requests Negotiations</p>
<p>Document Submitted to the Government</p>
<p>Since the French Concession's Municipal Council promulgated the Regulations for the Management of Steam Engines and Machinery, it has openly levied inspection fees on the Hongxing Hosiery Factory to inspect our country's factories. The Mechanical Industries Association of national commodity factories in this city has therefore submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry of the National Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, requesting strict negotiations regarding inspection rights to prevent disguised encroachment. The original text reads: "Submitted for the authorities of the French Concession deliberately encroaching upon our country's factory inspection rights and levying steam boiler inspection fees, requesting strict negotiations to protect sovereignty. On April 16th of this year, the member Hongxing Hosiery Factory reported that on the 6th of this month, the French Concession Health Bureau sent personnel, accompanied by the Fire Brigade, carrying machinery to inspect the factory's boiler, injecting 120 pounds of cold water, and left satisfied. Unexpectedly, today (April 10th)</p>
<p>a notice in French was sent, stating that an inspection fee and other expenses totaling seventy yuan should be paid annually, which is deeply surprising. As it concerns national sovereignty, the factory is unwilling to rashly set a precedent," and attached a photo of the French notice to the association. The association immediately submitted a report to your ministry, requesting reasonable negotiations, and the French Concession authorities also stopped collecting the fees. Unexpectedly, after half a year, the old matter was brought up again, and a notice was issued to the Hongxing Hosiery Factory, first collecting half the fee. The factory recently reported that the special zone's factory inspection issue is under negotiation. In April of this year, the French Concession Municipal Council suddenly inspected the factory's boiler and levied an annual inspection fee of seventy yuan. As it concerns our country's sovereignty, it was reported to your association and forwarded to the Nanjing Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, requesting protests. Unexpectedly, on the 22nd of this month, another notice in French was received from the French Concession Municipal Council, still intending to levy an inspection fee of thirty-five yuan for half a year, claiming it is based on the recently promulgated Regulations for the Management of Steam Boilers in the French Concession. The factory believes that money is a small matter, but sovereignty is a major issue. Whether the inspection fee should be paid has not been dared to be decided without authorization. Therefore, a special letter is sent to your association to forward it to the Nanjing Ministry of Industry and the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting a clear instruction to follow. Because the factory is under the accumulated prestige of foreigners and easily makes mistakes, it should request the government to provide protection. A photo of the French notice is attached to the association. It is found that the Regulations for the Management of Steam Engines and Machinery, promulgated by the French Concession authorities this spring, are sufficient to seize our country's sovereignty. After being revised and promulgated recently, the Hongxing Hosiery Factory was asked to pay half a year's inspection fee first, and their deliberate encroachment on sovereignty is obvious. Our government is now working hard to recover lost sovereignty, and such disguised acts of encroachment cannot be tolerated. A photo of the French notice and a copy of the Regulations for the Management of Steam Engines and Machinery published in the Shanghai Commercial News are attached, and a document is submitted to your ministry for review and verification. A strict negotiation is requested to protect sovereignty, and instructions are requested so that factories in the concession can be protected and complied with, which would be a great convenience.</p>

<p>A Pioneer in Developing Foreign Trade</p>
<p>The National Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China previously received a letter from the Consulate General in Sydney, Australia, requesting that it collect business indexes, guidance books, and publications from various domestic goods organizations to introduce them to local overseas Chinese businessmen. The Chamber immediately sent letters to various domestic goods organizations, including the Shanghai National Products Manufacturers Association, and informed them of the situation, requesting collection. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Public Letter from the General Chamber of Commerce: Yesterday, the General Chamber of Commerce sent letters to the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, the Shanghai National Products Factory Association, the Shanghai Mechanical National Products Factory Association, the China International Trade Association, the China National Products Manufacturers Association, the China National Products Co., Ltd., the China National Products Production and Sales Company, and other domestic goods organizations, stating: "With respect, we have received a letter from the Consul General in Sydney, Australia, stating: 'Promoting trade between China and Australia is originally the task of this consulate. However, local businessmen often come to inquire about the situation of Chinese merchants and factories. The existing domestic industrial and commercial indexes and guidance books are outdated or too brief and not applicable. We plan to collect and keep the latest domestic industrial and commercial guidance books or indexes at this consulate to introduce them to local businessmen at any time, thereby promoting domestic goods and developing foreign trade, which your association will surely be happy to guide and assist. Please send a compilation of national goods manufacturing industries for introduction.' In view of this, please ask each industry to send the latest product trademarks."</p>
<p>Notice from the Manufacturers Association: After receiving the letter, the China National Products Manufacturers Association specially sent a notice to all manufacturers yesterday, stating: "Regarding the notice, in accordance with the letter from the National Chamber of Commerce forwarded by the Consul General in Australia, it is stated (original text omitted as above). It is found that our country's foreign trade is gradually declining. The Consul General in Australia stated that local industrial and commercial circles often inquire about domestic industrial and commercial situations, and the existing domestic industrial and commercial indexes and guidance books are not very applicable. Therefore, they specially requested that the latest product trademark catalogs of domestic manufacturers be compiled and sent to the Consul in Australia for introduction. As it concerns the promotion of foreign trade, please immediately send the product catalogs of your factory to this association for compilation and forwarding to the National Chamber of Commerce, which will then forward them to the Consul General in Australia."</p>
<h3 id="e90">Representatives from Twelve Provinces' Private Postal Bureaus <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Continued Emergency Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Resolved to Petition the National Government to Extend the Closure by Five Years</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Transportation ordered the Directorate General of Posts to instruct private postal bureaus to cease operations, private postal businesses in various ports across the country have been in a state of panic. They all believe that once closed down, more than 100,000 people engaged in private postal services across the country would be innocently unemployed. Therefore, they have successively sent representatives to Shanghai to discuss the aftermath. An emergency meeting was held once a few days ago. Considering the seriousness of the matter, more than 100 representatives from twelve provinces, including Jiangsu and Zhejiang, gathered at the private postal bureau in this city at 4:00 PM yesterday for a second emergency meeting, resolving to petition the Central National Government to extend the closure by five years and deciding to hold a large-scale petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government and Municipal Party Headquarters on Wednesday and Thursday next week. The details are as follows, as learned by the East China News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting: The national private postal industry held its second emergency meeting at the private postal bureau on Li Xian Gua Street at 4:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included representatives from Shanghai, Yin Yuantong and Hua Yunqing; representatives from Nanjing, Yue Xiechen; representatives from Yangzhou, Chen Jieren; representatives from Zhenjiang, Zhang Shiyu; representatives from Ningbo, Liu Shousheng, Xu Shan, Chen Bangxian, and Zhang Liansheng; representatives from Sichuan, Zeng Senchang and Yu Geshun; representatives from Jiaxing, Shen Baifu, Ying Chunyu, Shen Guoliang, Li Bingquan, Chen Kangning, Xu Ashun, and Zhu Qingfu; representatives from Yantai, Wang Ziying and Qiu Zhensheng; representatives from Datuantuan, Fang Xianzhang; representatives from Zhoupu, Chen Shaozhong; representatives from Hangzhou, Wu Bingshang, Wang Dabin, Yu Kedong, Zhuang Gengtang, Wang Zuhao, and Zhang Guitang; representatives from Fuzhou, Li Baosheng; representatives from Wenzhou, Wang Yongzeng; representatives from Suzhou, Ren Shiting; representatives from Shantou, Wang Hengfu, Fang Baokang, Fang Baoxiang, Zhang Xiling, Dong Pinsen, and Huang Huinan; representatives from Xiamen, Ge Tianxiang; and representatives from Hankou and other ports, totaling more than 100 people.</p>
<p>Petition for Extension: The meeting was chaired by Yin Yuantong, a representative from Shanghai. After the meeting was formally opened, the representatives jointly discussed the matter. As a result, it was decided to draft a petition immediately and, before December 10th, send three representatives to Beijing to submit the petition to various agencies of the National Government, the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Transportation, requesting them to consider the difficulties of the people and extend the deadline by five years before closing down. If necessary, representatives from the national private postal industry will be convened again to make a large-scale petition to the Fifth Plenary Session, not stopping until the goal is achieved.</p>
<p>Scheduled Petition: In addition to resolving to petition the National Government to extend the closure by five years, the meeting also decided to gather representatives from all parties next Wednesday and Thursday to launch a large-scale petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government, Municipal Party Headquarters, and Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and issue a letter to compatriots, explaining the difficulties of closing down private postal bureaus and the convenience of having private postal bureaus, hoping that compatriots across the country will sympathize and demand relief. The discussion dispersed at around 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Assistance from All Parties: According to Chairman Yin Yuantong, speaking to the East China News Agency reporter, the history of this industry has long been revealed in various newspapers. The news of the Ministry of Transportation's order to close down our industry came suddenly and in a hurry. It is known that there are more than 1,000 private postal bureaus across the country, with more than 100,000 employees. If they are closed down, it will not only be inconvenient for compatriots, but how will such a large number of unemployed people be taken care of? Wouldn't that be sitting and waiting for death? Therefore, we most hope that the authorities will consider the difficulties of the people and have appropriate party methods to enable 100,000 people to be able to work and maintain their lives. Therefore, this industry is drafting a petition to request the central government to extend the deadline by five years, so that during this period, they can gradually change industries or find their own ways to close down. Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, and various industry associations all believe that this matter is a serious issue and will also hold meetings to discuss and decide on assistance plans.</p>

<p>Women's Groups Fiercely Oppose</p>
<p>Believing It Is More Ridiculous Than Before</p>
<p>Will Still Strive for Consensus</p>
<p>Women's friendship groups held a joint emergency meeting and fiercely opposed the decision of the Legislative Yuan's Criminal Law and Legal System Committee on the 28th to review Article 239 of the Criminal Law, which revised the original text to "Anyone who commits adultery with a married person shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than one year," believing that the wording was vague and even more ridiculous than before. They also issued a declaration calling on women across the country to make a final effort to fight for it. The original text is recorded as follows: "To the women compatriots across the country, for thousands of years, the various inhuman oppressions suffered by women in our country have been entirely based on legal inequality. In order to eliminate obstacles to family happiness and maintain social morality, there has been this struggle for Article 239 of the Criminal Law. Unexpectedly, the results of the Legislative Yuan's review are even more ridiculous than before, and the wording is also vague. 'Only those who commit adultery with a spouse are punished, but those who commit adultery are not punished.' This is not only unfair, but also seems to intentionally encourage spouses to commit adultery with others. Our association and others advocate restoring the original draft or adding the five words 'those who commit adultery are also the same' to the review and amendment. As it concerns family happiness and social morality, we respectfully hope that our women compatriots will urge the legislators to awaken and create impartial and selfless laws and regulations to promote the Chinese nation on the road to rejuvenation. Otherwise, with what we consider to be dangerous, our association and others will still strive for consensus, not stopping until the goal is achieved."

<p>Decided to Cruise Around North China First</p>
<p>Also Going to Lianyungang and Lao Yao</p>
<p>You Sheng Books Passenger Seats</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's second new Hai Heng steamer, currently under inspection at the Jiangnan Shipyard, has assigned crew members and sailors to board the ship yesterday to receive and inspect various items. The shipowner and the first, second, and third officers have decided to be filled by Chinese, without giving in to the Hong Kong government's demands. After the bureau took over the ship, it was decided yesterday that the first maiden voyage would not go to South China, but would go to various parts of North China. It is expected to depart from Shanghai next Saturday, first arriving in Qingdao, where it is planned to invite people from all walks of life to board the ship for a visit, and then go to Tianjin, no longer stopping at Yantai and Weihaiwei. When heading south from Tianjin, it will also go to the newly opened port of Lianyungang in Haizhou and dock at Lao Yao. The You Sheng Travel Group in this city has booked all the passenger seats on the ship to organize a North China tour. Many people have recently joined, taking advantage of this new ship's special North China cruise to take a tour.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement Considers Transportation Issues <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Plans to Send Experts to Study Management Methods</p>
<p>Now Submitted to Two Committees for Further Review</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's Transportation Committee has recently conducted detailed discussions on the traffic management plan within the settlement, and has listened to various reports and opinions. It was recently decided to request the Board of Directors to appoint a qualified traffic management specialist within the Police Department. This proposal was submitted to the Board of Directors for discussion on the 28th of this month and was decided to be submitted to the Police Committee and the Merit Committee for further review.</p>
<p>Points for Discussion: At the recent Transportation Committee meeting, Mr. G. Robinson was specially invited to participate in the discussion. Mr. Robinson pointed out the important points, namely: (1) To negotiate and cooperate with neighboring authorities; (2) To complete statistics and produce traffic maps; (3) Enforce existing regulations and add new regulations, with strict penalties; (4) Study new tools for traffic management; (5) Close cooperation between various departments in the bureau, with mutual consideration in all aspects of road excavation; (6) Appoint a traffic expert to formulate the implementation steps.</p>
<p>Appointing Experts: A committee member also advocated that a traffic engineer with experience and ability should be appointed. This person is urgently needed to manage traffic and should not be delayed due to financial problems.</p>
<p>Accident Statistics: According to the report submitted to the committee by the Chief of Police, the number of deaths caused by traffic accidents in this settlement in 1933 was 10.7 per 100,000, compared with 15.9 in New York, 16.5 in London, and 25.7 in Los Angeles. The number of injuries was also not high in comparison in this settlement. In 1929, the number of car licenses was 6,575, and the total number of traffic deaths that year was 141. By 1933, the number of cars was 9,367, and the number of deaths decreased to 107. The total number of accidents in 1924 was 6,085, and in 1933 it was 13,571. However, regarding statistical comparisons, it is still necessary to consider the speed of vehicles and the size of the area.</p>
<p>Cooperation Among Three Settlements: Regarding Mr. Robinson's first point, the chairman of the committee said that the three municipal government agencies are now discussing cooperation methods for public transportation. Regarding statistical methods, Mr. Robinson said that personnel could be sent to count on the road, or special electrical counting machines could be used, or movies could be taken at a certain speed. The Chief of Police said that since 1919, the number of vehicles has been recorded once a year at 16 locations within the settlement, each time for two days. As for the production of traffic maps, the Director of Public Works said that it is not difficult to create a map to show the number of vehicles passing through each item, but the difficulty lies in how to express the relationship between each vehicle.</p>
<p>Traffic Court: The discussion then turned to the impact of traffic congestion at one point on other points. It was generally agreed that it would be beneficial to compile statistics on points that are prone to congestion. As for the level of punishment for violations, it has been carefully considered that it is impossible to set up a special traffic court in this settlement to be in charge of this matter.</p>
<p>Traffic Signals: Regarding how to systematize the release and stop of vehicles at various points, it is impossible to implement without installing expensive automatic signaling devices, and it is rare to prevent horizontal traffic from running at the same time on one road in the United States today. The alternative is to allow vehicles to continue moving unimpeded on a fairly long stretch of road, but in Shanghai, the types of vehicles are different, and there are rickshaws, making implementation difficult. Perhaps the opening and closing of traffic lights at each point can be given precise timing regulations, but no matter what method is implemented, it must be carefully planned. The Chief of Police then said</p>
<p>, it is not easy to speed up traffic, mostly due to the form of the road and its narrowness. One-way Traffic: Mr. Robinson continued to describe the progress of traffic management tools over the past ten years, and said that the implementation of a detailed circular or one-way traffic system would definitely be beneficial in Shanghai. The Director of Public Works said that promoting the one-way traffic method is extremely beneficial, but it is feared that it will be opposed by the majority of residents and cannot be implemented. It seems that too much attention has been paid to the convenience of automobiles, and the convenience of public buses, trams, and rickshaws should also be considered, as the number of passengers in these types is far greater than those in</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>automobiles. The lunch time is too uniform, resulting in congestion at noon, and attention should also be paid to the long-term parking of private cars on the road. It is his opinion that the current building regulations should be revised to ensure that houses have more open space for parking. It was also suggested that a one-way traffic system be implemented on certain roads, but only for cars, not for rickshaws, or that the one-way system be extended during busy hours. It is said that in a certain place in the United States, one-way traffic was tried and stopped after three months, and merchants requested to restore it. This system can be considered a good thing. Then a committee member said that the experience of merchants on Hankou Road does not consider this a good thing. Public Transportation: The discussion then turned to traffic management and its related aspects, recognizing that the main transportation system must be flexible in order to benefit the general public. The Director of Public Works said that the laying of tram tracks was adapted to the previous situation, and it is difficult to repave them. Today, trams are still a cheap means of transportation for most people. Although trolleybuses are more active, the cars cannot overtake the cars in front of them. Public buses are more flexible and better than trams, but the operating expenses are huge. The use of diesel engines can save expenses, but the import tax is also very high.</p>
<p>Studying the Situation: Regarding the employment of a traffic expert, Mr. Robinson continued to state that if this person is obtained to engage in specialized research, the existing equipment can be used to increase the convenience of vehicle travel. The expert must first study the local situation before proceeding with the improvement plan. A committee member advocated that this specialist should be permanently employed and work closely with the police.</p>
<p>Proposed Methods: After the above discussion, the committee thanked Mr. Robinson for his great assistance and then decided to recommend to the Board of Directors that a qualified traffic specialist be appointed within the Police Department. However, the chairman of the committee simultaneously stated that this recommendation does not contain any criticism of the personnel and effectiveness of the current traffic division of the Police Department.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Fellow Villagers from Hunan in Shanghai Petition the Central Government <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Send Senior Officials to Hunan to Supervise the Suppression of Remaining Bandits</p>
<p>And Appoint Representatives to Go to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>More than 200 fellow villagers from Hunan in Shanghai, including Yang Shixun, He Bingkun, Zheng Yan, Zhang Qipei, and Shen Ruli, recently petitioned the Central Government and the National Government in a joint name regarding the issue of the Red Bandits' intrusion into Hunan and disturbing the villages, requesting that senior officials be dispatched to lead troops into Hunan to pursue and suppress the remaining bandits, and appointed representatives to bring the document to Beijing to petition. The original submission is recorded as follows: "Submitted to petition for the dispatch of officials to supervise the suppression, provide funds for disaster relief, and reduce and exempt taxes to save Hunan and relieve the suffering. Our province of Hunan has recently been disturbed by the intrusion of communist bandits from Jiangxi, and all counties that have been passed through have been burned and killed, with no one spared in terms of life and property. Although the central government has recently dispatched a large army to enter the territory to suppress them, it is difficult to achieve victory due to the lack of a leader. Therefore, it is requested to quickly dispatch senior officials to supervise the entire bandit suppression force to eradicate the root causes of the communist bandits and avoid proliferation. This is also the first thing. This year's drought in Hunan Province has spread to more than 60 counties, and the grass roots and tree bark in various places have long been used up for hunger relief. However, the taxes in Hunan Province have increased endlessly, causing the residents of the disaster-stricken areas to commit suicide if they are weak, and to join the bandits if they are strong. Without providing relief, how can the lives of the people be preserved? Therefore, it is requested to provide disaster relief and strictly order the authorities of Hunan Province to reduce and exempt taxes in the disaster areas to comply with the central government's political strategy of suppressing bandits and alleviating the suffering of the people. This is also the second thing. The Hunan militia has always been able to defend itself. Since the reorganization by the Hunan Province authorities two years ago, the remaining abandoned guns and remnants of soldiers have caused the Red Bandits to invade and have no way to defend themselves. Therefore, it is requested to strictly order the Hunan Provincial Party Bureau to return the original excellent guns of the militia and cancel the additional six million yuan in militia land tax in order to reorganize the militia and reduce the people's distress. This is also the third thing. The petitioners are from various counties in Hunan Province. Recently, frequent reports have been received from home, saying that entire families have fled, or that they have all been burned and killed, or that they have been donated and levied. Every word is the sound of blood and tears from their hometown. How can the entire family and the entire village endure long-term decay? Unable to do otherwise, they plead and petition the Central Government to quickly find ways to provide relief and relieve the suffering."</p>

<p>Regarding the U.S. Proposal to Convene a Pacific Conference</p>
<p>The International Problems Research Society, a private group in this city, issued an English opinion on the recent non-official U.S. proposal to convene a Pacific Conference. The translation is as follows: "In view of the impending failure of the current London Naval Conference, the world has no choice but to seek other ways to resolve</p>
<p>this important and complex international problem, so as to avoid the crisis of naval competition. Anyone who understands the naval treaty issue knows that the establishment of the former naval treaties was based on certain political conditions, such as maintaining peace in the Far East and guaranteeing China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity. Japan now demands naval equality with Britain and the United States, but refuses to discuss political issues in the Far East. It is no wonder that the London talks are about to fail. Recently, the non-official U.S. side has proposed convening a Pacific Conference, and Britain has also expressed its agreement, while Japan dismisses it with a smile. Does Japan intend to obtain naval equality by unilaterally announcing the cancellation of the naval treaty? Can naval issues be completely separated from political issues? If Japan is prepared to compete with Britain and the United States in naval armaments, then its strong attitude today must change. Otherwise, the common interests, peace, and security of the Pacific countries will be greatly affected. In this meeting, our country is naturally the most relevant country, because the rights of our country, which were jointly guaranteed by the Pacific countries twelve years ago, have been tragically trampled on since the September 18th Incident. We hope to correct the previous injustice, recover the lost land, and obtain a more complete guarantee in the future. Britain and the United States have now made it clear that the integrity of China's territory is the key to their Far East policy. On the Japanese side, although they want to achieve naval equality, they turn a deaf ear to the proposal of the Pacific Conference. If Japanese politicians take a long-term policy on guaranteeing peace in the Far East, they should warmly welcome the convening of this conference, because the desire of various countries for them has long been suspected. This meeting is giving them a chance to eliminate doubts and make a clear discussion on various issues of maintaining peace. Today, Japan takes an isolated policy, refuses to participate in political talks, and takes a haughty attitude towards the proposer, which can never lead to the resolution of important international issues. On the one hand, Japan will never be able to obtain considerable naval equality because of this, and on the other hand, it will bear the responsibility for the failure of the London Naval Conference."</p>

<p>Must be completed within the Lunar New Year period</p>
<p>So as not to delay the people's spring plowing next year</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: News reports state that the water outside Changyuan County's city walls is one zhang higher than inside the city, posing a risk of the entire city being submerged. In response, Kong Xiangrong of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee's Labor Relief Team issued a written statement saying, "I just returned yesterday from supervising work at the Guantai Longmenkou and Jiugulu breach sites. Since the efforts to block the Guantai breach began, the water level has been visibly receding, and the source is gradually being blocked, so it shouldn't be that severe. I have already telegraphed Sang Ze-tong and Wang You-long, two members of our team stationed in the field, to personally investigate the situation in that county. All projects, including blocking the Guantai breach to cut off the flow, restoring embankments and plugging breaches at Jiugulu and other county locations, and plugging and dredging the interconnected waterways around Daniezhuang, are being undertaken simultaneously and progressing smoothly. Our team is aware that time is pressing, and the weather will soon turn cold and the ground freeze, making it difficult to obtain soil. Therefore, we are rigorously supervising the progress to ensure that the plugging is completed before the end of the Lunar New Year, with the goal of not delaying the people's spring plowing next year." It is also learned that Mr. Kong will return to the front lines soon to continue supervising the work.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Recent Trends in China's Shipping Industry <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new "Sihai" ships</p>
<p>A vital force amid the loss of shipping rights</p>
<p>The new "Sihai" ships built by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are expected to arrive in Shanghai within the year, which will replenish tonnage for coastal shipping and provide a vital force for the industry. Yesterday, the reporter had the honor of speaking with Mr. Li Yunliang, Chief Auditor of the company, about the trends in the domestic shipping industry, the strength of foreign shipping along the coast and the Yangtze River, and proposals for cooperation in the shipping industry, which are of utmost importance. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Foreign Shipping Strength</p>
<p>Our country's offshore and inland rivers have convenient shipping conditions, but unfortunately, foreigners have become the dominant players. British merchant ships number over a hundred, with approximately 260,000 tons, concentrated in companies such as Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire. Japanese merchant ships number thirty-five, with approximately 75,000 tons, owned by companies such as Nissin Kisen, Dalian Kisen, and Osaka Shosen Kaisha. The number of unscheduled liners operated by these three companies is even greater. The U.S. has the Yangtze Rapid Steamship Company, and France has the Compagnie Franco-Chinoise de Navigation, with a total of twelve ships and approximately 7,000 tons. The total tonnage is estimated to be over 350,000 tons. Steamships on the Yangtze River are 140,000 tons, accounting for seven-tenths of our Yangtze River transport. Offshore shipping routes are almost entirely owned by foreigners. In recent years, the reclaiming of shipping rights has been widely proclaimed. The Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the Anglo-Chinese Mackay Treaty, and the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce and Navigation have all expired. The government should vigorously strive to fully regain the shipping rights that have been infringed upon. However, weak countries have no diplomacy. Whether or not shipping autonomy can be achieved is still uncertain.</p>
<p>National Shipping Decline</p>
<p>An investigation reveals that there are only 512 Chinese-owned ships with a tonnage of over 100 tons, totaling 380,000 gross tons, which is a very small percentage of the world's 70 million tons. Among them, only over 40 ships have a registered gross tonnage of over 2,000 tons, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company accounts for one-third of these. The average age of the ships is approximately 34 years. In the last 15 years, only four new ships with a tonnage of over 2,000 tons have been built, and only ten with a tonnage of over 1,000 tons. The rest are small vessels. Furthermore, the number of ships lost each year is quite high, and the new construction may not even be enough to compensate for the losses. As for the slight increase in total tonnage in recent years, it is entirely due to the purchase of old ships from foreign merchants, which are old, poorly equipped, and slow, making it impossible to compete with foreign merchants.</p>
<p>China Merchants Resurgence</p>
<p>In the Yangtze River shipping industry, Chinese ships, British ships, and Japanese ships stand as three legs of a tripod. However, in ocean shipping, Chinese ships lag far behind. The Beiyang (Northern Seas) routes have ships such as the "Xin Shengjing" and "Xin Shuntian", and the Nanhua (Southern China) route has ships such as "Taiyuan" and "Jinan". Consequently, Chinese people traveling on the major north-south ocean routes still have to rely on foreign ships, resulting in the outflow of profits and creating a helpless situation. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also took this into consideration when building the "Sihai" ships. Purchasing old ships at a cost of 1.3 million yuan per ship would have allowed the company to buy at least four or five ships. However, to revive coastal shipping and replenish near-sea trunk lines, which is an urgent need for national transportation, the company could not only focus on short-term profits. Therefore, it resolutely ordered these four ships from England. All operational plans have also been thoroughly reformed, and the company relies on the support of the Chinese people and the protection of the government for cargo and passenger business. By the end of this year, all four ships will be able to sail on the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) route. With this vital force, China's shipping industry can finally hold its head high to some extent.</p>
<p>Cooperative Endeavors</p>
<p>In March of this year, the Ministry of Communications convened a meeting of shipping merchants from across the country to discuss measures to promote the shipping industry. Although there were over 200 proposals, the most important one was the proposal for shipping cooperation. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Communications, the Shanghai Shipping Association and the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company jointly formed the China Shipping Cooperation Design Committee. Within six months, the committee had drafted a plan. Subsequently, the shipping industry will automatically establish a China Shipping Cooperative, and each shipping route will first form separate alliances, with the government providing supervision and protection. The current Shanghai-Taiwan, Shanghai-Yangzhou, and Shanghai-Tianjin routes will make the disorganized shipping industry, compelled by environmental needs, achieve a spirit of unity. If the situation can be guided to benefit them and promoted, removing obstacles, it is possible, because apart from a few companies such as China Merchants, Sanbei, and Zhengji, most of China's shipowners are extremely dispersed, with many companies owning only one or two ships. The competition is very fierce, and the exclusion is even worse. Freight rates are plummeting, and the cost of transporting coarse goods is sometimes as low as seven or eight cents per dan (unit of weight). If this continues, Chinese ships will be in a tragic situation, facing annihilation. Therefore, implementing cooperation is the only way to save the shipping industry. The government should provide supervision to prevent the evils of monopoly. In this way, the serious problems in the shipping industry can gradually be solved.</p>

<p>Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, has suffered from severe drought this year, with barren land everywhere and withered crops. The Zhejiang Provincial Government issued 20 million yuan in disaster relief bonds, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also instructed that they be used solely for work-for-relief programs. However, the elderly, weak, women, and children are on the verge of starvation, their cries for food heartrending. For this reason, the county magistrate of Cixi, Cheng Yingju, came to Shanghai yesterday to contact fellow villagers in Shanghai for assistance. He is scheduled to petition the Shanghai Drought Relief Association, the Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, the China Relief Society, the Bodhi Dharma Society, the China International Famine Relief Commission, and the Jiaxu Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association within the next few days to seek relief.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Guichi County, 85% Disaster-Stricken, 85% Grain Taxed <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Appeal of the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association</p>
<p>The Telegram of the Drought Relief Association</p>
<p>Guichi County, Anhui Province, has suffered severely from drought this year. According to an investigation by the Central Relief Committee, 83% of the area has been affected by the disaster. The members of the Anhui Provincial Government, after on-site inspection, determined that the actual percentage was 85%. However, Commissioner Qiu Cheng considered that the harvest was 58%, and therefore decided that 85% of the grain tax should be collected as usual. The Finance Committee of the county, the Fellow Villagers Associations in Qingdao, Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai have successively requested the Anhui authorities to correct this, but to no avail. Yesterday, the Shanghai Association again petitioned the Shanghai Drought Relief Association for assistance. The telegram from the Relief Association is as follows:</p>
<p>To Chairman Liu of the Anqing Provincial Government, Commissioner Mao of the Department of Finance, and Commissioner Xiang of Chizhou: According to a letter from the Guichi Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, "Our county has suffered an extraordinarily severe drought. The Central Relief Committee's investigation found that 83% of the area has been affected. Commissioner Zhang Hongyou of the provincial government and the county magistrate conducted an on-site inspection and reported that the percentage affected was over 85%. However, Commissioner Sun Peijing, in assessing the autumn harvest, considered that there was a 58% harvest, and therefore decided that 85% of the grain tax should be collected as usual. The reasons for this error are: (1) The polder fields were not considered to be affected by the disaster. These fields only account for one-tenth of our county's arable land and are distributed among various 'bao' (administrative units). Even if they are considered unaffected, they are already calculated within the un-polderized fields affected in each 'bao'. There is no separate polder field area. This phrase should not be added to the assessment of the affected acreage in each 'bao' to deceive our people. (2) Miscellaneous grains were planted after the autumn harvest. Our county only received 30 shi (unit of volume) of buckwheat seeds from the Construction Department, which were distributed and planted, covering less than 200 mu (unit of area) of arable land. Moreover, due to drought and frost damage, how much can be harvested? Even if there is a thin harvest of millet and sorghum, it is purely for tenant farmers to survive and not pay the full rent, and it has nothing to do with landowners who pay grain tax. How can this be used to increase the harvest assessment? Furthermore, this point has already been reported to the Finance Department through the Commissioner, stating the error and requesting a correction. However, the assessment is still based on Commissioner Sun's decision, and the harvest is assessed at 58%, which has been submitted to the province for approval to begin collection. The disaster victims, who are on the verge of death, cannot bear this unjust tax." The Association has investigated and found that the drought this year is extraordinarily severe. The Association previously resolved to telegraph the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, informing them of the affected provinces and properly exempting the affected farmland from regular and surtaxes, which has been approved. Now, the county, with an 85% disaster situation, must pay 85% of the land tax, which does not seem like a way to show compassion for the disaster victims. It is requested that the Director-General, Chairman, and Commissioner investigate the two errors made by the Committee and correct them to show fairness. The disaster victims will be fortunate, and the region will be fortunate. Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the Shanghai Drought Relief Association, Xu Shiying and Wang Zhengting, Vice-Chairmen, respectfully present this report.</p>

<p>And opening of the Second Representative Assembly</p>
<p>On the 28th, the Shanghai Postal Workers Union held the 12th Inauguration Ceremony of the Executive and Supervisory Committee members and the Second Representative Assembly at the Management Bureau. Over 200 people attended, including all Executive and Supervisory Committee members, representatives from various branches, and members. Dai Youheng, representative of the Municipal Party Department, and Zhu Xuefan, representative of the National Postal Workers General Union, were present as observers. Chairman Zhang Kechang presided over the meeting, with Xiao Qingshan recording. The meeting began with the ringing of the bell. After the customary formalities, the Chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating in brief: "Today, we are holding the 12th Inauguration Ceremony of the Executive and Supervisory Committee members and convening the Second Representative Assembly. We are honored to have representatives from the Municipal Party Department and the General Union present to provide guidance. We are especially excited to see the representative of the General Union here today. Since the members of the General Union resigned previously due to difficult circumstances, postal workers across the country suddenly lost their guidance, and the public was extremely apprehensive. Fortunately, the postal workers across the country, with their united strength, urged the authorities to become aware, and the outstanding issues were resolved. Furthermore, after the sincere appeals of friendly associations in various locations, the members of the General Union have announced their reinstatement. We feel especially gratified to see each other today. Furthermore, today, the members of this committee are being sworn in under the supervision of the Municipal Party Department and the General Union. We hope that all members, after taking office, will continue to work diligently on association affairs with the spirit of past administrations. We especially hope that all members will provide supervision at all times to ensure that association affairs will continue to develop." Then, all the Executive and Supervisory Committee members took the oath of office. Next, Dai Youheng, representative of the Municipal Party Department, delivered a speech, stating in brief: "Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce, so there are more labor unions than in other places. Among those that are sound both in form and in spirit, there are few besides the Postal Workers Union. I hope that you will continue to work hard to promote and develop it. I especially hope that the Executive and Supervisory Committee members will work diligently and loyally in their respective positions after taking office." Zhu Xuefan, representative of the National Postal Workers General Union, delivered a speech, stating in brief: "Since the establishment of the Postal Workers Union, the union has been organized in most parts of the country. We are very fortunate that the organization of postal workers, whether in terms of quantity or quality, is very sound. However, this has caused some people to pay attention, and they are concerned about the expansion of the postal workers' power, or even become jealous. Therefore, the resistance we have encountered is very great. To cope with this environment, we must continue to work hard. Today, the Executive and Supervisory Committee members are being sworn in. I hope that all members will be loyal to their duties and strive for the development of association affairs. I especially hope that Shanghai postal workers will not underestimate the greatest determination and hope that they should have, and work hard towards our goals. We are in this era not only to seek our own welfare, but also to unite postal workers across the country to seek the revival of the nation." The following matters were then discussed: (1) The General Union members have announced their reinstatement after being unanimously requested to stay by the whole country. How should this association express its opinion? It was resolved: sincerely support it. (2) Association members have traditionally relied on membership cards. Now, according to the order of the General Union, it is necessary to issue badges separately. How should this be handled? It was resolved: Pass the motion and issue badges separately. (3) The association has suggested to the authorities that a postal workers' hospital should be established, but it has not yet been realized. How should we promote its realization? It was resolved: The Executive Committee should actively handle it. (4) The Executive Committee proposed: Now, the budget statement for the income and expenditure of this committee is proposed. Please discuss and approve it. It was resolved: Modified and passed. After the discussion, a group photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Someone Scammed Tang Yunsheng's Wife <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>A Case Within the Shi Case</p>
<p>China News Agency reports: Tang Yunsheng, who was arrested and detained in Hangzhou in connection with the Shi case, has not yet been released. His wife, Ms. Qiang, went to Hangzhou on the 21st of this month to visit him, staying for four nights, and returned to Shanghai on the 26th. Yesterday, the reporter visited Tang Yunsheng's wife, Tang Qiang, at the Sun family residence. According to her, "On this trip, I did not meet my husband (Tang Yunsheng). I indirectly received news from other sources that he needs to be identified by Ms. Zou, who was injured at the Shi residence, after she recovers, to determine if he was the perpetrator at the scene. If he is not suspected, he will be released. I only know that he is detained in the Provincial Public Security Bureau and is in good health. However, on the day I (Qiang) went to Hangzhou, a letter was delivered to my house by the post office. The letter stated that Yunsheng was suffering from illness and vomiting blood, and that he needed 300 yuan to purchase a precious medicine. The sender was named Cheng Jishou. The matter was quite strange. At that time, because I am illiterate, I felt quite terrified and helpless. Later, I took the letter to my uncle, Ma Chunyan, and after people deliberated, and since my husband did not mention any illness when I was in Hangzhou, I realized that the letter was a forgery and that someone was deliberately creating a false situation to extort money. In short, my husband, Yunsheng, is a legitimate businessman, and the truth will soon come out. The forged letter is currently at my uncle's house. Yesterday, someone from Hangzhou came to investigate, and I have already shown them the letter." The reporter then went to the Ma Yongsheng Hot Wine and Sundries Shop opened by Tang's uncle at the intersection of Lubangsheng Road and Yichang Road and copied the original letter, as follows: (The following two envelopes were sent as one piece to the Tang residence at No. 11 Sunjiazhai) (1) To Madam Tang: I am entrusted by Mr. Tang Yunsheng to communicate from Hangzhou to Shanghai. I originally intended to present the letter in person, but I heard that the investigation is very strict, so I dared not come forward. Therefore, I sent it by post office. Currently, Mr. Tang's condition is very serious. Please take care of it immediately upon seeing the letter and do not make any mistakes. When it is done, please use a piece of red paper to write the four characters "Zhaoban Yituo Yitao" (dealt with properly) and paste it next to the left side of the mountain gate of the Xiahai Temple on Kunming Road. After I see it, I will immediately return to Hangzhou to inform Mr. Tang. This is of utmost importance. Because I am afraid of being implicated, I am sorry that I cannot talk in person. If the madam does not take care of it, I will definitely take the night train back to Hangzhou on the 23rd. I will not say more and wish you well. From Cheng Zhenshou, written on the night of the 21st. (2) To my dear wife: I am writing to you. This time, I have suffered unjustly for no reason, which is extremely unfortunate. Since the incident, I have suffered greatly. Now, because of excessive mental stimulation, I suddenly suffered a serious illness, vomiting fresh blood, and my condition is very serious. My life is in danger. I repeatedly asked the bureau chief to allow me to go to the hospital for treatment, but because the case is serious, it was not approved. Fortunately, the police officer Bao provided assistance and secretly described my condition to the hospital, asking the doctor to prescribe a simple prescription. However, this medicine is extremely expensive, costing around 300 yuan per dose. I am specifically asking Mr. Cheng to inform you in Shanghai. I hope that my wife will see this letter and act quickly. No matter what, buy one dose and send it over to save my life. This is of utmost importance. Please do not make any mistakes. I wish you good health. From your husband, Tang Yunsheng. November 21st. Also, one dose of Grade 1 18-Ingredient Ginseng Blood Circulation Incense from the Jiuzhou Pharmacy at the head of Dongxin Bridge, South of Zhejiang Road, according to the prescription.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Four Assassinations in Two Years, Resulting in Five Deaths <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Communist Assassination Squad Organized After the Beat-Dog Squad</p>
<p>Kuang Huian and Ten Other Criminals Interrogated Yesterday and Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>| The Court Was Heavily Guarded During Yesterday's Trial |</p>
<p>The tragedy that occurred at Renji Hospital on September 26th at 3:00 PM, in which three lives were taken, was carried out by Communist bandits. After the incident, the police authorities of the International Settlement mobilized their detectives to investigate. Within 24 hours, they cracked down on the assassination organization formed by the party, arrested Kuang Huian, the second-in-command of the gang, and ten other male and female accomplices, and seized a large number of firearms. Later, it was also confirmed that these individuals had assassinated numerous people in the International Settlement in the past two years. They were charged with endangering the Republic of China, premeditated murder, and violating the regulations on the prohibition of military firearms, and were prosecuted separately. The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court has repeatedly held trials to investigate the facts of the various cases committed by Kuang and others. The facts of the cases have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Criminal Court President Yu Hua and two judges, Zhao Zhengzheng and Zhou Han, specially convened a collegial panel to conduct a public trial. Chief Prosecutor Wang Zhennan also attended the court to perform his duties. The investigation lasted until 5:00 PM, when the debate was declared closed, and the sentencing was scheduled for the afternoon of December 6th. The guards inside and outside the court were removed after the criminals were escorted back to the men's and women's detention centers in prison vans. Now, we will describe in detail the various cases committed by the assassination squad in the past two years, as well as the circumstances of the arrest, the cracking of the case, and the court trial.</p>
<p>Organizing the Assassination Squad: The Communist Party has always regarded riots and massacres as its main tasks. In the past, it secretly organized the "Beat-Dog Squad" in Shanghai, targeting police officers who were unfavorable to them. In recent years, law enforcement officials in this city have been assassinated numerous times. Two years ago, thanks to the efforts of the police officers from both the Chinese and international settlements, the "Beat-Dog Squad" was finally cracked down. Most of the members of the squad were arrested, sentenced according to law. However, there are still several people who should be executed by decapitation and are temporarily detained in the Western Prison, waiting for the order to be executed. After the "Beat-Dog Squad" was eliminated, the Communist leader Yao ordered the establishment of this assassination squad to continue the cruel acts of the "Beat-Dog Squad." Yao then ordered Kuang Huian, a native of Shantou, to direct his followers to carry out the work. Yao himself was in a position to issue orders, so the members of the squad could only approach Kuang and did not know who Yao was. All the weapons and firearms needed for the assassinations were issued by Kuang when needed. Kuang and his concubine, Lin Er-mei, a Cantonese, rented the upstairs of the Xinwenxiang Silver Shop at No. 112 Julai Road in the French Concession. The firearms were also stored there.</p>
<p>Four Assassination Cases: According to the investigation by the police, the first task of the group after it was created was the assassination of Ma Shaowu (also known as Lu Keqin), a secret agent of the former Municipal Public Security Bureau, on the night of June 14th of last year, in the small garden of Zhejiang Road. The participants were Kuang Huian, Meng Huating from Hubei, and four bandits who have been arrested and punished in Beijing and Shanghai. On June 9th of this year, Kuang was ordered by his leader Yao to harm Chen Jing, who succeeded Ma Shaowu. Therefore, on that day, he and his accomplices Zhao Xuan and Meng Huating from Hubei, Zhu Jinming from Anhui, and Zhang Mazi, who had already been arrested and imprisoned, ambushed him near Hankou Road and Guangxi Road. When Chen passed by, they opened fire. Chen fell to the ground after being hit by a bullet. Wang Jinrong, a Chinese constable numbered 558, who was on duty there, heard the sound and gave chase. Kuang and the others dared to resist arrest and shot and killed Constable Wang. Chen Jing recovered from his injuries and returned to Beijing after leaving Shanghai. This case was the second act of violence by these individuals. On the night of September 16th, Kuang, Zhao, Meng, and Zhu, together with Zhang Mazi, carried out their third assassination. They broke into the Qianji Inn on Shanxi Road and shot and wounded Xiong Guohua, who had served in the Northeast Volunteer Army and whom these individuals referred to as a traitor who colluded with the Japanese and puppet police in Guanwai (Northeast) to harm the volunteer army. Because the result was only that Xiong was injured, they were still not satisfied. After a ten-day interval, Kuang led Zhao, Meng, and others to break into a ward of Renji Hospital and kill him in his hospital bed. At the same time, two other people were killed: Wan Yuke, the detective guarding Xiong, and He Yongfu, the Chinese constable of the French Concession who was escorting a sick prisoner to the hospital for treatment. In total, they carried out four assassinations in two years, resulting in five deaths and one injury. They were extremely cruel.</p>
<p>The Course of Solving the Case: Since the Renji Hospital tragedy occurred, the military and police in this city have paid close attention. On the afternoon of September 27th, within one day, the firearms hiding place inside the Xinwenxiang Silver Shop was cracked down. Twenty-five various types of handguns, two Mauser pistols, 1,003 bullets, one steel vest, and one bayonet were seized. Kuang's concubine, Lin Er-mei, was also arrested there. Subsequently, Kuang, Zhao, Meng, and Zhu, and Tang Wanxuan, a native of Yangzhou, were arrested. An elderly woman from Ningbo, Li Yang, and her daughter-in-law, Li Zhou, from Hubei, were arrested because her husband (Li Yang's son) was also a member of the gang. This time, Yao ordered Kuang to order Zhao, Meng, and Zhu</p>
<p>to move into Room 13 of the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, where they were arrested. In addition, Liu Jinrong, a worker at a certain yarn factory who is currently the director of the labor union, and Zhang Li, a female worker from Chongming in the same factory, were also detained because they had arranged to go to Hongxiang for a private meeting, involving them in suspicion. After a thorough investigation by the police, they were charged with endangering the Republic of China, violating the Emergency Law, violating the regulations on the prohibition of military firearms, and the crime of premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Law, and were prosecuted separately to the Second Branch of the High Court.</p>
<p>The Circumstances of the Trial: Yesterday afternoon, the collegial panel organized by Judge Yu brought Kuang and the other ten male and female defendants to court for a public trial. The facts of the crimes committed by the defendants had been repeatedly interrogated and clarified. Yesterday, they were interrogated one by one again, and then the debate began. First, Gan Jingxian, the lawyer representing the police, spoke, stating that Kuang, Zhao, Meng, and Zhu were all in important positions in the Communist Party, which constituted the crime of endangering the Republic of China and the repeated crime of premeditated murder. He requested that they be punished according to the law. Li Yang and Li Yang's daughter-in-law were highly suspected of being involved in the Communist Party, and Li Zhou had been arrested previously in connection with a Communist Party case. This time, Zhu Jinming confessed that she was again working in an important position in the Communist Party. As for Lin Er-mei, she not only hid military weapons under the bed and next to the pillow in her bedroom, but also was Kuang's wife, so she was obviously helping the Communist Party in its work. He requested that they all be given serious consideration. Although the remaining Tang Wanxuan, Liu Jinrong, and Zhang Li lacked direct evidence, he also requested that they be judged freely.</p>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the 6th: After the lawyers hired by the defendants and the lawyers appointed by the court to provide free defense debated one after another, Chief Prosecutor Wang Zhennan stood up and argued that, "As a result of the investigation of this case, it was not possible to actively prove the criminal behavior of Liu Jinrong and Zhang Li in going to the Hongxiang Hotel. The fact that Li Yang and Li Zhou are the family members of important Communist Party members is already clear. It is also impossible to fully prove whether Tang Buxuan is related to the Communist Party. Since Lin Er-mei is Kuang's wife and a large number of military weapons were hidden in her room, it is undeniable that she helped the Communist Party in its work. As for the four defendants, Kuang, Zhao, Meng, and Zhu, they have confessed to the charges of endangering the Republic of China and the various cases of murder and attempted murder, and they have been proven. The purpose of these people is similar to that of the 'Beat-Dog Squad' that was previously cracked down. They can be regarded as the second 'Beat-Dog Squad'. Therefore, they should be handled according to the established case of the 'Beat-Dog Squad'. He requested that the presiding judge make a judgment according to the law. After he finished speaking, Judge Yu announced that the sentencing would be held at 2:00 PM on December 6th. The defendants were then escorted back to the police station and women's prison for detention under heavy guard.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Jiahe Steamer's Three Abductees Sent Letters Home <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Bandits Investigate Families' Circumstances</p>
<p>To Determine Ransom Standard</p>
<p>Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiahe steamer was hijacked, three crew members have been held for over twenty days. The company telegraphed authorities in Fujian, Guangdong, and the Navy Department for rescue, but their whereabouts remain unknown. The families of the crew members are extremely anxious. Yesterday, letters from the three abductees, sent from the bandits' lair to Shanghai, arrived. The bandits also dispatched their accomplices to investigate the financial circumstances of the three hostages, using this information to determine ransom amounts. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Send Letters to Shanghai The Jiahe steamer's business director, Shen Qinxiang, accountant Li Xiaobin, and tallyman Ge Liangchen were abducted by pirates from Shanwei and held in the bandits' lair for over twenty days. Their families anxiously awaited news, preparing for rescue. Yesterday, the Shen, Li, and Ge families each received a letter mailed from Hong Kong. Upon inspection, the letters were indeed written by Shen and the others from within the bandits' lair and taken to Hong Kong for mailing by the bandits, so there was no clear or detailed return address.</p>
<p>Comfortable Living in the Bandit's Nest Upon opening the letters, the families confirmed the handwriting as their own. The letters stated that since arriving at the mountains (but not specifying the name of the mountain, etc.), their food and lodging were relatively comfortable, and they were not suffering. They asked their families to be patient and not rush, and after the situation was clarified, it could be resolved, and they could return home for a reunion. The families suspect the three are being held near Dapeng Bay, but they cannot communicate with them.</p>
<p>Content of the Letters</p>
<p>The content of the three letters differed. The letter from tallyman Ge Liangchen was addressed to his widowed mother, and its tone was particularly poignant. He stated that their Shanghai residence was only a rented attic, and he was already two months behind on rent when he was abducted. He asked his mother to plead with the landlord to wait until he was released and returned to Shanghai to pay the rent. The letter from accountant Li Xiaobin advised his family not to worry, stating that the bandits were treating them well and there was no injustice. He said the bandits needed to conduct a thorough investigation of each hostage's family circumstances, and he hoped his family's poverty would be considered. The most important part of the letter from business director Shen Qinxiang instructed his family that if the bandits sent a representative to negotiate, they should ask the Shantou branch director to handle the matter. In reality, although Shen was a director, his family's financial situation was also quite poor.</p>
<p>Bandits Conduct Secret Investigation</p>
<p>When the bandits allowed the three men to send letters home, the bandit leader immediately sent his accomplices to investigate the financial situation of the three hostages, to determine if they had any assets, which would be used to set the ransom price. The three letters also mentioned that the bandits had sent people to conduct a secret investigation into the family circumstances of each person. However, how the investigation was being conducted was unknown.</p>

<p>Kicks and Punches Cause Severe Injuries</p>
<p>An old woman named Hua Da Si from Taizhou, aged 56, lives with her son Lin Chunshan, also known as Hua Chunshan, at 606 Avenue Petain, in the Xie Xing Chang paint shop. The old woman has been ill and unable to move lately. But Chunshan completely ignores his mother's daily needs. Helpless, the old woman asked Chunshan for living expenses on the evening of the 20th of this month at 8:00 p.m. Chunshan's bestial nature was revealed, and not only did he not give her any money, but he grabbed his mother and brutally beat her, kicking and punching her. Neighbors witnessed the abuse and could not bear it, so they stepped forward to dissuade him. The old woman was then able to escape, but had already suffered serious injuries. They immediately reported it to the Avenue Petain police station and hired lawyer Hu Jue to file a complaint with the Second Special District Court's criminal court, accusing her son Lin Chunshan, also known as Hua Chunshan, of abandonment and injuring his mother, requesting investigation and prosecution based on Articles 310, 311, 294, and 298 of the criminal law. The court accepted the complaint, and yesterday Judge Li Changnian opened a criminal court for questioning. The defendant did not appear, only the plaintiff Hua Da Si and her lawyer were present, stating the circumstances of her abandonment and beating by her son. The judge ordered a postponement and the defendant be summoned to appear for questioning.</p>

<p>Teacher's Wife Aware of the Affair</p>
<p>Police Arrest and Prosecute</p>
<p>Zhang Yinchen, 24, from Songjiang, who claims to have graduated from a certain school, is a lecherous man. His wife, surnamed Wang, and Er Bao, 23, from Suzhou, were not married but living together. They recently established Yuanchang Elementary School at 15 Yuanchang Lane, Yuanchang Road, Hongkou, where they served as teachers. Many young boys and girls in the neighborhood attended the school. Chen Wu Shi's 16-year-old daughter, Meiyun, a female student known for her beauty, lived nearby. Zhang, disregarding the reputation of a teacher, harbored evil intentions. On the afternoon of July 15, after class, he had his wife Wang lure Meiyun to the pavilion upstairs. Wang then left and locked the door. Zhang used sweet words and flattery to rape the girl. Afterwards, he told her not to tell her mother, or he would take drastic measures. The girl's will was weak, and she was young and ignorant, so she kept silent. She continued to attend school and do her homework. From then on, the teacher and student secretly met in the pavilion. Zhang became more intimate with the girl, and his feelings for his wife gradually cooled. Wang, regretting this, often quarreled with Zhang, preventing their rendezvous. Zhang was furious and transferred the school to someone else, moving to 223 Yuanfang Road. Zhang, still infatuated with the girl, invited her to the Great World amusement park on the afternoon of the 17th of this month and then went to the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road for a night of pleasure. The next day, he rented a pavilion at 21 Yongping Lane, Maigen Road, as a place to hide her. After Meiyun disappeared, her mother, Chen Wu Shi, searched everywhere. Remembering that she might be at Zhang's place, she inquired and learned from Wang that Zhang had also not been home recently. Chen Wu Shi, knowing that her daughter had been abducted, asked the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association for help and hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint against Zhang and his wife. The Hongkou Police Station's detective Zhang Yunsheng learned that Chen's daughter had been abducted and hidden in Yongping Lane, Maigen Road. The day before yesterday afternoon, he secretly went to a tiger stove near the lane to gather information. He saw Chen's daughter coming to fetch water and immediately stopped her, learning her address. He went with her to arrest Zhang. Chen Wu Shi confirmed that it was her daughter, and Zhang's wife was also brought to the police station. The police chief ordered them to be detained separately, and the girl was returned to her mother. The police charged them with rape and abduction and transferred the two defendants to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The case involved public morals and was closed to the public. When questioned, the defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Wu Zehan ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation. The complaint against Zhang Yinchen and his wife for offenses against public morals was scheduled for trial in the Eighth Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. However, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant appeared. Judge Wu Tingqi told the plaintiff's lawyer that the police had already filed a public prosecution in the case and would schedule a hearing after further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Inventor of Writing Cloth Received Assistance from Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Public Experiment Very Satisfactory</p>
<p>Writing cloth, needed by the Chinese cultural community, has always been imported, resulting in significant financial outflow each year. Zhu Jun Shilie devoted himself to research to counter this. However, due to financial constraints, he had not yet been able to establish a factory. After the newspapers reported on this, many people from all walks of life visited Zhu Jun's residence to see his work. Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, after receiving a letter from Zhu Jun requesting assistance, sent Mr. Xue Jianxin to Zhu's residence to investigate and conduct a face-to-face experiment. The results were excellent, and they promised substantial assistance. The following is a record of Zhu Jun's research process. Zhu Jun has a keen interest in scientific research. Ten years ago, he founded the Scientific Research Association, initially producing building steel tools and other items. Due to the failure of the Shanghai war, he turned his attention to chemistry, researching day and night with tireless efforts. Later, Sun Siyi, a reporter for the Financial Western News, proposed researching the invention of writing cloth. He spent two years but was unsuccessful, and his personal finances and spirit were on the verge of collapse. Fortunately, Mr. Sun repeatedly encouraged him and provided financial support, so he did not give up. After repeated experiments and painstaking exploration, he finally succeeded. He sent samples to major bookstores for testing, proving that they were superior to foreign products. However, he was unfamiliar with the procedures for registering with the Ministry of Industry and requesting rewards. Therefore, he wrote to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce for assistance. Yesterday, the chamber sent representative Xue Jianxin to Zhu Jun's residence at No. 3 Renhuai Lane, Xicang Street, in the city to conduct an on-site inspection and investigate whether it was entirely made of domestic raw materials. Zhu Jun personally presented the manufacturing chemical formula and publicly tested the manufacturing methods for writing cloth, such as imitation leather, crepe cloth, and lacquered cloth. The results were very satisfactory to Mr. Xue, and he agreed to submit a report. The chamber will do its best to assist in requesting the Ministry of Industry to grant rewards and exclusive manufacturing rights.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Branch Chief Li Swiftly Solves Theft Case <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Two Thieves Caught Checking Pedestrians</p>
<p>Another Thief Caught Based on Confession</p>
<p>Li, the chief of the Ximen City Public Security Bureau, ordered patrol officer He to lead patrol police Kong Fanchao, Zhang Shaoqin, Zhang Yao, and Yin Xiaozuo to check pedestrians. Yesterday around 8:00 p.m., while checking on Jumen Road in the Nanshi district, they noticed two suspicious individuals. They immediately ordered them to stop and searched them. They found a six-inch Browning pistol with serial number 100264, ten bullets, as well as 1116 double coppers, 31 copper tickets, 29 silver dollars, three ticket dollars, a gold ring, and two leather robes. They took the two thieves to the Ximen branch bureau and ordered Shen Wenda, the leader of the resident detective team, to investigate. They interrogated the thieves, who identified themselves as Ding Fusheng, 23 years old, from Jiangyin, living in Beitadai, Yangshupu. Today, he had gathered with Zhang Heshang and four others at the Nanxing Inn in the French Concession of Xieqiao to rob a rickshaw company in Changan Lane, Jumen Road, whose name was unknown. Zhang Heshang, 30 years old, from Changzhou, who lived with Ding Fusheng, said that the pistol belonged to Ding Fusheng and that there were four other accomplices who had escaped. After obtaining the confession, Chief Li ordered detective team leader Li Wenda to strictly pursue the accomplices and bring them to justice. He also ordered the Liyuan Road branch to investigate the name of the victim and the circumstances of the robbery for verification. At 9:30 p.m., the police from the Liyuan Road branch went to investigate and learned that Jiang Fuyin, 34 years old, from Yangzhou, who lived at 22 Changan Lane, Jumen Road, ran a rickshaw company. Around 8:00 p.m. that night, five robbers came, three guarding the door and two going upstairs with guns to rob. They stole 1600 double coppers, 43 silver dollars, one leather robe each for men and women, and a gold ring. The plaintiff, Jiang Fuyin, was taken to the bureau for questioning. Detective team leader Shen Wenda learned from the thief Ding Fusheng that the pistol belonged to his accomplice Chen Fulin and two other accomplices. Shen immediately dispatched deputy leader Fang Lingen and detectives Qiu Shuxian and Yu Ruhai, together with the Yangshupu police, to Beitadai to arrest the accomplice Chen Fulin, who was brought to the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Reform of Rickshaw Design Agreed Upon <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Rickshaw Driver Registration Starts Immediately</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's proposed new standard design for public rickshaws was met with objections from rickshaw owners. After a long period of consultation, the rickshaw owners' representatives have agreed to use the new design. In the past month, 131 old cars that had been determined to be discarded by the inspection office were allowed to extend the period for one month to replace with new cars. However, rickshaw owners have reported stockpiled materials for old-style new cars, estimated at more than 1,200. To avoid additional difficulties for rickshaw owners, it has been agreed that 350 of these can be used to replace old cars discarded in the future.</p>
<p>As for the registration of rickshaw drivers, it is now scheduled to begin on December 3. Rickshaw owners are encouraged to cooperate fully. The dates specified on the previously issued registration recommendation forms will be pushed back by two weeks. That is, those originally scheduled for November 19-24 will be changed to December 3-8, and those originally scheduled for November 26-December 1 will be changed to December 10-15, and so on.</p>

<p>Wife Sues for Divorce</p>
<p>Dai Baoquan, 31, from Ningbo, lives at 145 Racecourse Road and works as a chauffeur for a major merchant. His wife, Zhang Xinghua, 26, also from Ningbo, has been married for ten years and has one daughter. The couple had a good relationship. However, Dai suddenly became involved with Wang Meiying, an actress from the former Zhaohua Film Company, and lived with her, neglecting his wife and turning violent. If things didn't go his way, he would beat her with iron objects such as fire tongs. They have fought in the police station many times, and Zhang has had her injuries verified by the court prosecutor. Recently, Zhang has been repeatedly abused by her husband and can no longer live with him. Therefore, she hired lawyers Yu Enliang and Ma Leming to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court for divorce and demand repayment of debts incurred when he neglected her. Yesterday morning, Judge Yu Changzi opened the Fourteenth Civil Court for questioning. Dai Baoquan denied his relationship with Wang Meiying, saying it was just friendship. However, Zhang Xinghua said that if it was just friendship, why were his clothes and other items all at Wang's place? Dai accused Zhang of leaving their child at home at night, crying alone and not returning until late at night. The court, considering the relationship between the couple, attempted to mediate, asking Dai to pay Zhang 40 yuan per month for living expenses and guarantee that he would break off his relationship with Wang Meiying and no longer abuse her, and Zhang should not abandon her child again. However, both sides argued fiercely, and Judge Yu could not persuade them to agree. Judge Yu adjourned the case for further questioning with witnesses.</p>

<p>Woman Feng Liu Shi, 23, lives at 330 Ruijin Road. Her husband, Feng Jinsheng, works as a worker in the Oriental Red Electric Light Company on Jing'an Temple Road. The couple has been married for several years and has generally been harmonious. They have one child, who is still in infancy. On the day before yesterday, when she was doing housework, the child suddenly cried incessantly. Her mother-in-law, Feng Luo Shi, could not bear to see this and ordered her daughter-in-law to put aside what she was doing and breastfeed her grandson. Liu Shi ignored her. A verbal dispute arose between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Liu Shi suddenly felt extremely resentful and conceived the idea of ending her life. She secretly swallowed one yuan's worth of opium. When her husband discovered her moaning in bed, she refused to tell the truth. He immediately sent her to Hongkou Maternity Hospital. The doctor diagnosed a very serious illness and reported it to the Jiaxing Road police station. Detective Lu Shouchang was ordered to investigate and learned the details. She was transferred to Guangren Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and she soon died. The body was taken to the Fielun Road autopsy room. Yesterday morning, Tang, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Wei and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the scene. After examining the body, Western police chief Wei A reported the situation and said that he had notified the family the day before yesterday that they should come to claim the body the next morning, but they had not yet arrived and requested instructions. Tang said that the examination showed that the deceased, Feng Liu Shi, was a female who died from opium poisoning. The family had not yet arrived, so the body was temporarily handed over to the Pushan Villa for safekeeping. It was later learned that the reason the deceased's mother-in-law and husband had not arrived at the autopsy room was that they were trying to borrow money for a coffin.</p>

<p>Collect Remaining Food, Postpone Coffin Closure, and Re-Test or Autopsy</p>
<p>The Shunxing Restaurant at 50 Rue Orloff, Hongkou, suffered an incident the day before yesterday in which diners died from poisoning. The restaurant is owned by Han Huatang and Lin Rongzeng (44 years old, residing at 28 Dongbaoxing Road) from Haimen, and Li Zitang (46 years old, residing at 31 Sanle Lane, Xingjiaqiao Road). The restaurant specializes in providing food for laborers. All the food is taken from leftover food from major restaurants, re-cooked, and resold at low prices. The victims, mostly rickshaw pullers and laborers, ate the third batch of rice of the day before becoming ill. A total of eleven died. Two died on the spot: Gu Koulang, from Chongming, residing at 147 Fengtian Road, and Chen Ziying, 41 years old. Zhou Da Erzi collapsed and died on Linping Road while on his way home. Lu Jiayu, 30 years old, from Yancheng, residing at 8 Liancheng Lane, Tiantong Road; Jiang Xiaogenzi, 19 years old; Ding Fushan, 47 years old, both rickshaw pullers, residing in Oujiacun, Hongsheng Lane, Rue Orloff; and Luo Mingkui (also known as Honglin), 57 years old, former police chief of the North Sichuan Road branch, all died at home. Zhao Xiaolao Hai, 19 years old, from Yancheng, residing in a grass hut on Linping Road; Ma Kuijin, 25 years old, residing at 45 Ruihua Lane, Rue Orloff; and Xu Zhenhong, 35 years old, residing at 7 Gongkuan Lane, Yucai Road, all died at Tongren Hospital before they could be treated. Cao Zhenhai (also known as Ai Qiang), a local, 26 years old, residing at 59 Rue Orloff, had visited a friend on Yangjiabang Road after the meal, so he died at his friend's house before he could be treated. The incident was not noticed at the time. The authorities were first reported to the Linping Road branch, and the restaurant owners, except for Han Huatang who escaped, have been successively detained by the Linping Road branch. These include Lin Rongzeng, Li Zitang, Yin Tianmu (43 years old, from Zhenjiang), Li Caigen (40 years old, from Haimen) and Lu Caixiang (32 years old). The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has paid close attention to this incident and has delegated the Director of the Testing Institute and chemists to investigate. They have collected leftover food and fish bones in the garbage can for testing. The results have not been determined yet. All bodies, except Cao Zhenhai who was reported too late for verification, were reported to the local court yesterday morning. The court then delegated prosecutor Wu Deying and a team of examiners to conduct an investigation yesterday afternoon. As the cause of poisoning is unclear, the local heads were ordered to arrange for preliminary burial of the bodies without closing the coffins and wait for a re-examination or autopsy. At the same time, the Linping Road Public Security Bureau was instructed to transfer the leftovers to the court and send them to the Zhenru Forensic Examination Institute for examination. It is believed that an autopsy will be required.</p>

<h3 id="e120">City Chamber of Commerce to Hold Exhibition of Improved Chinese Bookkeeping Starting Tomorrow <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>From the 1st to the 3rd</p>
<p>From 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM</p>
<p>Our country's current bookkeeping is broadly divided into two schools: Chinese and Western. Western bookkeeping uses a horizontal format, and the paper, ink, accounting principles, and methods all rely on foreign imports. Not only is it difficult to imitate, but the cost is also enormous. Chinese bookkeeping uses a vertical format, and the paper, ink, accounting principles, and methods are all familiar to Chinese people. However, the system is flawed, lacks organization, and fails to meet the fundamental purpose of accounting, so it is often criticized. Mr. Xu Yongzuo, an accountant in this city, has spent more than ten years researching and compiling more than forty kinds of improved Chinese accounting books and forms. Each type is accompanied by detailed explanations, and a book entitled "An Overview of Improved Chinese Bookkeeping" has also been compiled to provide a general explanation of the entire improvement plan. Since its publication last year, it has attracted considerable attention throughout the country. The City Chamber of Commerce has held large-scale lectures and exhibitions for it. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Chinese Institute of Accounting Policy have also sent separate letters of introduction. Major newspapers in this city have successively published special issues on improved Chinese bookkeeping, demonstrating the importance attached to it by society. This year, more and more people are adopting improved Chinese bookkeeping, and its effectiveness is becoming increasingly apparent. The City Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Xu's accounting firm are also constantly engaged in training bookkeeping personnel and promoting the improvement plan. The Chamber of Commerce will hold a large-scale achievement exhibition at its premises from the 1st of next month to February. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Training Process　Since the exhibition and lectures on improved Chinese bookkeeping were held last year, requests for opening training courses to train bookkeeping personnel have been overwhelming. Remote areas such as Shaanxi, Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and the South Seas Islands, as well as nearby areas such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Jiangxi, and Anhui, often send letters requesting correspondence courses. Mr. Xu, Mr. Wang Yansong, Standing Committee Member of the City Chamber of Commerce and Principal of the Commercial Night School, and Mr. Yan Esheng, Secretary of the City Chamber of Commerce and Deputy Principal of the Commercial Night School, jointly drafted a simple charter and prepared a statement of purpose. The Commercial Night School of the City Chamber of Commerce and Xu Yongzuo Accounting Tutorial School jointly established an improved Chinese bookkeeping training course. Enrollment began on the 10th of July, with a planned enrollment of 400 students. However, the number of applicants was extremely enthusiastic, exceeding 700 in less than ten days. Later, there were hundreds more who could not be accommodated. Classes began on August 1st, with one hour of instruction each morning. Mr. Xu Yongzuo served as the chief instructor, and Mr. Pan Shihao, Mr. Xu Hanqing, Mr. Zhang Jun, and Mr. Lu Shanzhi served as instructors. The term was two months, with systematic explanations of improved Chinese bookkeeping and practical exercises on various accounting books and forms. In addition, special lectures were given by Mr. Wang Yansong, Mr. Yan Esheng, and Mr. Xu Yongzuo during weekend breaks. The classroom was located in the assembly hall of the City Chamber of Commerce. Due to the large number of people, the China Wireless Radio Research Institute installed a public lecture machine to facilitate listening. Lectures were completed on September 30th, and the instructors continued to guide the students in practical exercises. Graduation exams were held in late October. Recently, the examination of all academic achievements was completed. A total of 427 graduates passed, with 95 in Grade A, 164 in Grade B, and 160 in Grade C. Most of them are accounting personnel in the industrial and commercial sectors. Graduation certificates were issued on the previous two days. This is the first large-scale training of accounting personnel in the domestic business community.</p>
<p>Continued Promotion　Since the end of the improved Chinese bookkeeping training course, there have been many requests from all walks of life to continue the course, and many requests from other places for correspondence courses. Mr. Xu Yongzuo started a correspondence course in October, and the number of students has reached more than 590. At the same time, he jointly runs an elective course on improved Chinese bookkeeping with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and a specialized course on improved Chinese bookkeeping with the Shanghai Machinery-Made National Goods Factory Union. Mr. Pan Shihao, an employee of Xu's accounting firm, serves as the instructor. All the courses are roughly the same as the training course, but the Machinery Union focuses on manufacturing bookkeeping. Most of the students are accounting personnel from various factories. They are currently engaged in practical exercises on various accounting books and forms, and are expected to graduate around the end of the year. According to officials from the Machinery Union, various factories have a good impression of improved Chinese bookkeeping and plan to adopt it in batches after the graduation of this year's students to see its practical effects.</p>
<p>Achievement Exhibition　During the training period of the improved Chinese bookkeeping course, students have practiced various accounting books and forms many times. Many of the practical exercise papers are excellent and can be used as a reference for those who adopt improved Chinese bookkeeping. Mr. Xu's newly revised improved accounting books and explanatory books are also suitable for publication at this time. Therefore, the City Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Xu agreed that from December 1st to 3rd, the best student achievements will be selected for exhibition at the City Chamber of Commerce for three days. Each day, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, all sectors are welcome to visit and view freely. At the same time, more than forty kinds of improved Chinese accounting books and forms recently published by the Standard Accounting Form Document Manufacturing Institute, as well as the newly revised sixth edition of the "Overview of Improved Chinese Bookkeeping" and lecture notes, will be displayed for comparison. During the exhibition, many graduates of the training course will provide guidance and explanations to visitors. At 10:00 AM on the 2nd, a lecture will be held to elaborate on various issues related to improved Chinese bookkeeping. Mr. Xu Yongzuo, an accountant, and prominent figures from the business community will personally give lectures. It is reported that the City Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to all trade associations, informing all members to participate.</p>

<p>Chamber of Commerce Chairman Yu Zuoting to Perform Unveiling Ceremony</p>
<p>Deputy Manager Ma Shaoquan Concurrently Serves as Head of Savings Department</p>
<p>The Dahu Commercial Savings Bank in this city was organized by prominent business figures in this city, including Wang Yansong, Sun Hegao, Tong Rongchu, Xue Chunsheng, Li Heqing, Zhu Wenqi, Jin Runyang, Ye Yinshan, Zhu Meixian, Gong Xiang, Pan Luyan, Zheng Youzhou, Shen Jinfu, Yu Guozhen, Ma Shaoquan, and Wang Honglai. It has been operating on Shanxi Road for more than two years. Due to prudent investment, effective management, and the growing development of its business, in addition to the original commercial and savings departments, it also operates various trust businesses such as real estate mortgages and house rentals. As a result, the original address was not sufficient for expansion. The bank's board of directors decided to rebuild a new-style building at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Xiangfen Lane, the prosperous center of this city, covering an area of more than two mu. The latest style offices have been set up and the project has been completed. All sectors of the party, government, military, gentry, and business in this city are invited to attend the ceremony.

<p>At about 9:00 AM on the 21st of this month, the Shanghai Bank sent 5,200 yuan to the savings office of Jiaotong University on Haig Road. On the way, it was robbed. Yang Peisheng, the Chinese detective chief of the Yulin Road Police Station, along with detectives Huang Yufu and Ma Wenda, arrested the criminals Tan Jingeng, Huang Yaosheng, Zhang Zilong, and Liu Yucai. Zhang Yuanyuan from Haimen and Zhu Xuelong, a tea servant at Jiaotong University, were subsequently arrested in the jurisdiction of the Sixth District of Zhabei. Tan Jingeng and others were detained in the Public Security Bureau and escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation. All of this has been reported in this newspaper. The Chinese and Western detectives in charge of this case subsequently arrested Fei Amei, a local accomplice, at No. 4 Qingxue Road in Zhabei. Together with the Zhang and Zhu criminals, they were brought back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, detailed the process to the Third Criminal Court and requested an extension for a joint trial. Fei Amei confessed that Xuegen, who is at large, invited him to Zhang Zilong's house on Daxilu to discuss the robbery. After the incident, he received 150 yuan. Zhang Ruiyuan confessed that Zhang Zilong is his cousin, denied going to the robbery, and only got two yuan. Zhu Xuelong confessed that he delivered documents at Jiaotong University. Because the bank delivered money every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, he informed Zhang Zilong a month ago. Afterwards, he received 230 yuan. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for a joint trial with Tan Jingeng and others.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Resolution of Rickshaw Dispute Case <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Vehicle Committee Gave a Satisfactory Reply to All Rickshaw Merchants</p>
<p>Rickshaw Owners Form Repair and Manufacturing Cooperative</p>
<p>Various disputes over rickshaw replacement, etc. in the Special District have been resolved through negotiations between the rickshaw merchants and the Vehicle Committee, and have been approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department. The details have been recorded by the reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency from the Public Works Department as follows:</p>
<p>Rickshaw Merchants' Request　Rickshaw merchants in the Special District have repeatedly sent representatives, Yin Zhiling and Gu Songmao, to negotiate with the Vehicle Committee regarding rickshaw registration and replacement, and have put forward the following requests: (1) For the registration of public rickshaw pullers, in addition to the regulations for the registration of private rickshaw pullers, the rickshaw owners should introduce them. (2) The rickshaw owners' existing old-style new rickshaws should be allowed to be inspected and stamped from now on for continued use. (3) In order to facilitate and assist rickshaw owners in continuously replacing new-style vehicles, the vehicles may be mortgaged. (4) After the implementation of the new rickshaws, the vehicle inspection should be changed from once every two months to once every six months. (5) In addition to complying with the agreement on rickshaw rent of 1.50 yuan per day on August 6, the rickshaw companies should be allowed to collect arrears, savings, and accommodation fees from the rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>Vehicle Committee's Reply　The Vehicle Committee replied: (1) The registration of public rickshaw pullers will be carried out according to the method of registering private rickshaw pullers. The decision of 30,000 people should be introduced by the rickshaw owners. If it can proceed smoothly, the Committee will be responsible for considering and will sympathetically suggest to the Public Works Department that the rickshaw owners introduce the remaining rickshaw pullers for registration. If the registration reaches 40,000 people and it is still not enough to allocate, the Committee is prepared to increase the number of registered places. Only when the registered rickshaw pullers meet the required number of people can the registered rickshaw pullers be allowed to pull rickshaws. If the registered rickshaw puller is proven to have violated regulations and the license is revoked, or due to death, permanent departure from Shanghai, or bad behavior, the Committee will allow the rickshaw owner to introduce a replacement rickshaw puller. (2) In order to take into account the difficulties of the rickshaw merchants, if they are willing to actively cooperate in the rickshaw puller registration procedures, the Committee will suggest to the Public Works Department that 350 vehicles be replaced with vehicles that are no longer usable. The replacement of old-style new rickshaws should not affect the vehicles that have already been ordered to be replaced with new-style vehicles or have their licenses revoked. The extension for the replacement of the 231 vehicles that have already been ordered to be replaced will be extended by one month. The materials for the new-style vehicles can be modified, and the rickshaw owners can freely make suggestions. The Committee will adopt suggestions that are found to be beneficial. The new chapter of spraying paint can be replaced with various types of top-grade paint. (3) The Committee hereby reiterates that the Public Works Department has no intention of interfering with the mortgage of vehicles. If the mortgagee goes through formal and legal procedures to transfer the vehicle, and has sufficient evidence and the original owner's certificate, the transfer of the certificate will be approved. The Public Works Department Gazette of August 10th published the following Article 9 of the agreement between the Public Works Department representatives and the rickshaw owners on August 6th: "In order to resolve the ambiguity and misunderstanding in the wording of the public rickshaw license rules, two items have been agreed as follows: (A) The rickshaw owner who obtains the vehicle license does not have to be an individual, but the rickshaw company or guild can be the licensee. (B) Although the Bureau reserves the right to approve or disapprove the issuance of licenses at the end of each month, it will give considerable convenience to the transfer of vehicles due to sale or the transfer due to the death of the licensee. If the new licensee is deemed to be a suitable person and is willing to abide by the license rules and pay the rickshaw puller mutual aid fund donations, then the Bureau will approve the application when they purchase the vehicle or inherit it according to law." Of course, it can also be applied to mortgaged vehicles. (4) In order to meet the requirements of the rickshaw owners, the Committee will try to grant special permission for new-style vehicles to be inspected once every four months instead of once every two months. If this inspection method is satisfactory after the trial, the Committee will continue to implement it. The Committee is currently unwilling to cancel the licenses of rickshaws that are not in good condition, but is willing to try to first warn the rickshaw owners to improve new-style vehicles if there are any dissatisfaction and temporarily not</p>
<p>Cancelling the license. Rickshaw owners can apply to the Committee for a substitute worker's license badge if they automatically repair the vehicles. However, the license for the vehicle under repair should be deposited with the Public Works Department during the business hours of the substitute rickshaw. (5) Inquiring about the first item agreed upon by the rickshaw merchant representatives and the Public Works Department on August 6th, the daily rickshaw rent for public rickshaws from August 15th of this year will be a maximum of 0.78 yuan. Rickshaw owners who have prepaid the rickshaw puller mutual aid fund donation of 1.50 silver coins per vehicle per month may collect an additional</p>
<p>Seven cents per vehicle per day from the rickshaw puller in addition to the rickshaw rent. It is of course legal for the rickshaw company to collect arrears, savings, and accommodation fees from the rickshaw pullers. However, a receipt must be given for the collection of money and the rickshaw rent must be accounted for separately. If the rickshaw puller has an obligation to pay this amount, a separate account book should be kept for the Committee to check.　　Establishing a Cooperative　The requirements and replies of both parties have been approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, and all disputes have been resolved. The rickshaw merchants also held a meeting and decided to establish a rickshaw repair and manufacturing cooperative. The intention is to purchase all of the more than 1,000 new rickshaw shells stored in the rickshaw company. Those approved for use by the Vehicle Committee will then be sold by the cooperative to replace the 131 new-style rickshaws. The replacement of new-style vehicles will also be undertaken by the cooperative and sold to the rickshaw owners. The cooperative's handling fees will be distributed and raised equally among the rickshaw owners. It is purely a cooperation of the same industry to equalize the economic burden of the rickshaw merchants. The principle has been approved by the meeting and will be convened again to establish it.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Verdict of Mei Hua Company Sued Case <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Pronouncement Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>Pan Wenxia, a female actress from Nanjing of Mei Hua Film Company, was previously sued by the company's manager Zhu Ruifeng and Tang Hao lawyer for breach of trust at the First Special Court because she went to Shanghai Film Company to shoot a film during working hours without the company's permission. Later, the case was withdrawn after a settlement. However, the prosecutor's office of the Special Court, because there were many rumors outside that this prosecution actually contained the use of the court as a propaganda machine, and there were many doubts in the whole case, so the prosecutor Zhong Qing filed a public prosecution against Zhu Ruifeng and Tang Hao in accordance with Article 180 of the Criminal Law. The relevant information has been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan opened the Second Criminal Court for interrogation. Zhu hired lawyer Tan Yigong and Tang hired lawyers Dong Kang and Shi Liang for defense. Prosecutor Zhong Chen stated the intention of the prosecution, saying that the Ministry of Justice's Order No. 233 stipulated that civil cases filed with criminal charges should be treated as false accusations. Now, Zhu Ruifeng's case against Pan Wenxia is clearly a civil breach of contract case, but it is criminally prosecuted, which is actually a false accusation. It should be judged according to law.</p>
<p>Zhu Ruifeng confessed that Pan's incident was actually a breach of trust, so I entrusted lawyer Tang Hao to file a lawsuit. It was my intention at the time. Tang Hao confessed that this case was entrusted by Zhu. After he stated the facts, he wanted to file a lawsuit for breach of trust. After considering it, I believed that Pan's behavior met the conditions for breach of trust, so I drafted a lawsuit on behalf of the party according to the party's wishes. Then, the court ordered the start of the debate. After the prosecutor Zhong and the defendant's defense lawyer debated each other, Judge Wu ruled that the debate was over and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the afternoon of December 1.</p>

<p>At about 11:00 PM the other night, gunshots were suddenly heard at the intersection of Rihui Bridge, Dapu Road, and Xietu Road, which is under the jurisdiction of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The No. 70 patrolman of the Rihui Bridge Branch, about 300 steps away from the above-mentioned location, went to investigate after hearing the news and found an unidentified male body, about twenty years old, wearing a black cloth small cotton-padded jacket, gray thread spring silk cotton pants, black socks, flat head, lying face up on the ground, with bloodstains flowing from his nose, resembling a businessman. He examined the head and found gunshot wounds, which was actually an assassination. The Rihui Bridge Branch reported to the Ximen Branch and ordered the local bailiff to report to the local court for examination. The court sent a prosecutor to examine it at about 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon and took photos. It ordered the local bailiff to prepare a coffin for burial. The police were dispatched to investigate and arrest the murderer.

<p>Yongde Pawnshop on Hujiamuqiao Road in this city has been established for many years. Next door is a Tingshunlong Iron Shop opened by Ding Amei from Wuxi. At about 10:00 PM the other night, the workers of the iron shop were about to go to bed because they had worked too hard during the day. Suddenly, seven bandits broke into the door. The leader took out a pistol from his waist and said that no noise was allowed. The other bandits used iron tools to make a big hole in the wall and put a quilt on the ground to prevent the bricks and stones from making noise when they fell. They laughed in their mouths. The next door, in the middle of a sweet dream, thought that the neighbor was disturbing them and that nothing unexpected had happened. When the bandits came out of the hole and broke into the room, they woke up from their dreams. The bandits took out their guns to stop them from shouting, forced them to open the cabinet to get money, and searched everywhere. They robbed more than 280 yuan in cash and valuables such as gold rings and jewelry, worth about 500 or 600 yuan. When the bandits saw that their goal had been achieved, they left. Afterwards, the owner of the shop reported the details of the robbery to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. Chinese and Western detectives went to investigate. It is reported that the police authorities are now strictly arresting them.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3 id="e137">Qi University Has Resumed Classes <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>After Director He of the Department of Education Strongly Urged</p>
<p>(Jinan, 28th) All students of the College of Arts and Sciences of Qi University went to the Provincial Government to petition this morning. Director He Siyuan of the Department of Education received them on behalf of the government and tried to maintain order. He advised the students to return to school to resume classes, and he was responsible for contacting the Board of Directors by letter. He also stated that if the Board of Directors does not adopt the government's opinions, the government will not be responsible for anything that happens to the school in the future. Classes resumed this afternoon.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Students of the College of Arts and Sciences of Qi University on Suspending Classes to Promote the Resolution of School Affairs.</p>
<p>Since President Zhu Jingnong resigned in the summer of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Board of Directors has not produced a formal president. Only Mr. Lin Jiqing, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, has temporarily served as an agent. In the past two years, Agent Lin has worked hard to manage the school, and he has been assisted by the local government. The reputation of Qi University has been rising. Anyone who is interested can tell. Therefore, on August 15 this year, the Board of Directors formally passed a resolution to ask Mr. Lin to become the formal president in order to facilitate the development of school affairs. However, the Westerner Wei Limu, Shi Duoma, and others on the board were instigated by Dr. Schilder, Dean of the Medical School, and had ulterior motives. They intended to destroy the existence of our College of Arts and Sciences. After the resolution was passed, they repeatedly obstructed it. Seeing that the future was difficult, Mr. Lin resigned angrily at the beginning of this semester. Minister Kong Xiangxi also resigned as Chairman of the Board. The Board of Directors considered the issue to be serious, so it resolved on October 5 to send three representatives to the south to retain Kong and Lin, and the representatives also visited the local authorities and Mayor Shen to ask for assistance in retaining them. This time, Chairman Kong passed through Lu on official business and was repeatedly urged by the local officials to agree to withdraw his resignation and continue to be responsible. However, Wei Limu, Schilder, and others still insisted on their private opinions and acted arbitrarily. They manipulated everything in this Board of Directors meeting, forcing the Chinese directors to withdraw, and illegally overturned the resolution of August 15 with four votes (all Westerners, and not enough for a quorum). As a result, the list of students could not be submitted to the Ministry of Education, and the public was in an uproar. The students felt that the urgent solution to their own problems and the illegal manipulation of the Western directors had unimaginable consequences. Therefore, on November 20, the entire group gathered to petition the four Western directors, requesting them to abandon all private opinions and focus on the future of the school and the studies of all students, and on the one hand, they continued to attend classes as usual. The reason why the students did this was to take care of their own studies and were unwilling to take strike action to form a serious situation. We hope that all circles will understand this humble heart. Unexpectedly, Wei Limu and others regarded the students as insulting and had no sincerity in accepting the opinions of the whole group. They also made improper remarks and arbitrarily insulted them. In the end, due to the situation, they agreed to submit this issue to the entire Board of Directors for resolution. The students have lost trust in the repeated changes of Wei Limu and others. Even if the entire Board of Directors is convened, whether this Board of Directors can not be manipulated by them, whether the resolutions passed can not be obstructed by them, whether the president produced will be beneficial to our College of Arts and Sciences, all of these are questionable. Wei and others' actions are by no means sincere, but another insidious means to implement their destruction of our College of Arts and Sciences. This is undoubtedly the case. Therefore, the current dispute in our school is by no means a simple issue of the president, but an issue of Chinese people and two or three Western directors fighting for educational rights. The students should attach importance to their studies, which goes without saying. However, they are determined to oppose the use of education as a tool for personal fame and profit by Wei and others. Therefore, all students decided to reluctantly suspend classes from November 26, hoping to promote their awareness and petition the local officials for assistance. The matter was out of desperation, and the abandonment of studies is the responsibility of Wei and others. This has to be solemnly stated. Although the students are in a church school, they are receiving Chinese education and will definitely oppose all evil forces that destroy our Chinese education with all their strength. All our Chinese people should have sympathy. However, the students have limited ability, and the success or failure is of great importance. We hope that our Chinese people will give them voice so that they can achieve their ultimate goal. Then Chinese education will be fortunate, and all students of our College of Arts and Sciences will be fortunate.</p>
<p>According to a letter from the students of the Medical School of Qi University, the Medical School did not participate in the strike.</p>

<p>Sunday | Jiangwan Cross-Country Run</p>
<p>Next Week: Men's and Women's Race Walking</p>
<p>Individual sports are extremely popular, but because the association's members are required to pay a membership fee of twenty cents, it has led to misunderstandings from the outside, mistaking it for a registration fee, which is not accurate.

There is absolutely no possibility of profiteering. The association is scheduled to hold men's and women's Group A and B high jump competitions, men's Group A and B pole vault competitions, and women's 50-meter Group A and B competitions at the City No. 1 Sports Field starting at 1:30 PM this Saturday.

In addition, the association and the Pegasus Team are co-organizing the Jiangwan Cross-Country Run this Sunday. The registration deadline is set for this Saturday afternoon. The registration deadline for the high jump and other competitions is set for 8:00 PM tonight. Xu Zhiyi, Secretary-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, is donating prizes for the Jiangwan Cross-Country Run. All competition regulations have been detailed in last Sunday's newspaper. Those who wish to register should go to the China Individual Track and Field Competition Promotion Association at 272 Daji Road, Nanshi.

<p>When that Sister Hu was talking to you, I heard it from the side. After your husband left, I complained to him, saying he had eyes but didn't recognize Mount Tai [didn't recognize a great person]. He said he didn't mean to contradict Master Jia on purpose. Because he was in front of so many people, Master Jia said several things to him. If he didn't talk back, he was afraid people would laugh at him. Jia Duocai said: "He shouldn't have contradicted me even more in front of people." Xiao Ji said, "Yes, that's what I said too. Moreover, what the masters say always has a reason. He should have thought before answering." Let me point it out to him, and he'll understand. He said he would come tomorrow to apologize to Master Jia. Jia Duocai said: "What a joke! Don't come. Am I going to argue about right and wrong with this kind of person?" Xiao Ji lightly said: "It's not just him coming alone. He's bringing that little girl too." Jia Duocai couldn't help but laugh at this, and said: "That's even more wrong. That little girl didn't offend me. Why should she come to apologize?" Xiao Ji laughed: "That's just what I'm saying. Isn't Master Jia clear about what's in his heart?" Jia Duocai laughed: "Let me tell you, you've got the wrong idea. You think I'm from the bank, so I must have money. You don't know, the bank is opened by other people. I just work at the bank." Xiao Ji laughed: "Master Jia, we can't afford you to say that. I dared to say this because I saw that Master Jia really liked that girl. If you didn't have any feelings for her, then we would be setting a trap to cheat you out of money." Jia Duocai saw that Zhu Yueying wasn't with Li Shilian, and this was completely his own misunderstanding. He already quite understood Hu Saozi. Now that he heard that Zhu Yueying would come to apologize, he felt even more moved. So he laughed: "If they really want to</p>
<p>come, I can't stop them. But when there are a lot of people, tell them not to come. If they come, they should come quietly." Xiao Ji said: "Please let Master Jia decide on a time himself." Jia Duocai took out a cigarette case from his pocket, took out a cigarette, and sat in a chair, tilting his head to smoke. (77)</p>

<p>Tears fall frequently all day long. Not crying for Mr. Shi. Not crying, yet crying. What kind of feeling is this? (Mr. Shi's achievements are in society, dying unnaturally. What is lost is not just one person. Therefore, what I mourn today is not just Mr. Shi.) Who said the world is wide? Not allowing righteous people to walk. Who said the world is narrow? Demons and monsters follow closely. I remember last summer. Taking my child to knock on your door. A long talk of an hour. Loving words of dingning (careful instructions). (This summer, my child returned from the United States. Mr. Zhao Housheng introduced him to Mr. Shi. He also invited me to go with them. Upon seeing my child, Mr. Shi immediately expected him to be great and decided to extend an invitation to the Shen Bao newspaper office. Later, my child changed his mind and accepted appointments from Guanghua and Datong universities. Whenever I think of this, I often feel regret.) Unexpectedly, within a few months. Suddenly returning to the dark depths. Where can I find a demon-revealing mirror? To see the shapes of all the monsters. Where can I find a pair of flying dragons? To clear the way for you.</p>

<p>Mr. (Someone) was also a sociable figure in society. However, he had a peculiar habit. Whenever he attended relatives or other banquets, halfway through the meal, he would bid farewell to the host, claiming that he had to go to another banquet somewhere. In reality, there was no other banquet. After returning home, he would have to cook leftovers for himself to fill his stomach.</p>
<h3 id="e170">The Ethereal Record of Imperial Fragrance <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Let's suppose that, halfway through her tour, she suddenly thought of an important military and national matter, and wanted to write an imperial decree immediately, then pens, ink, paper, and inkstones would be delivered to her immediately. Furthermore, if her hair was blown by the wind, and she wanted to quickly tidy it up, she only needed to wave her hand or say a word. Her hairdresser, who was also a eunuch and greatly trusted by the Empress Dowager (she praised him as the number one hairdresser in China), would immediately bring the necessary tools and come to serve her. As for towels, fragrant powders, and other various cosmetics, they were even more readily available, easily obtained at any time and any place.</p>
<p>"There are four palaces here that we must visit." The Empress Dowager suddenly spoke to us during the procession. She was speaking to everyone, but I always felt that she was speaking to me alone. Although I knew this was just wishful thinking, I truly hoped so in my heart. Because I remembered very clearly that she had repeatedly told me that, once she passed away, the only person who could tell the world about her personality, character, behavior, and all aspects of her daily private life was me. Therefore, she wanted me to understand all the truths and realities, so that I would not be as isolated and misunderstood as outsiders. Her hope for me was that I would tell what I actually saw in the future, without adding or subtracting anything. At that time, she continued to explain to us why those four palaces could not be missed. "What is stored inside are the relics left by our Qing Dynasty emperors!"</p>
<p>She indeed led us into those four palaces, so we knew that they contained the relics of eight generations of emperors. Originally, this Guangxu Emperor, a political prisoner, was already the ninth emperor of the Qing Dynasty after entering the Pass. (187)</p>

<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>I also echoed the slogan "Go to the countryside" — and I was originally from the countryside. But my footsteps rarely step on "native land." So when someone from the countryside comes to Shanghai to see me, I feel extraordinarily cordial.</p>
<p>"Calculating" is an unbreakable habit of country people. I often warn them that Shanghai is not like the countryside and they must not be calculating. But they actually learn the trick of sitting on the "oil train" [illegally riding the tram], and the result is often being ordered to leave by the ticket inspector, and running back with sore legs!</p>
<p>They seem to know that Shanghai is where "pickpockets" come from, and that pickpockets are sure to pick on country people, so they dare not carry much money when they go out. Even the "tram copper coins" have to be carefully budgeted, just enough to cover the round-trip fare. If they want to buy some things and stroll on the street, their silver dollars must be carefully wrapped in layers of straw paper and newspaper before putting them into the bottom of the "belly band" worn in front of their lower abdomen. If they encounter a guy with a crooked hat and greasy hair on the tram, and they feel like a hand is groping at their belly band, they have to make a great determination to get off the tram quickly, find a quiet place with "urine stains" and let loose a bubble of urine to check if anything has been stolen -</p>
<p>Speaking of their "belly band," I always call it the "Cosmos Sack." Needless to say, silver dollars, deeds to land, pawn tickets, tobacco boxes, lighters, medicine bottles, and eyeglass cases all have to squeeze inside to join the fun. Therefore, when country people buy something and dig out their wallets from the Cosmos Sack, opening the layers of wrapping, the time and effort it takes is enough to annoy the shopkeeper -</p>
<p>They are mostly followers of Roosevelt, advocating the "silver policy" and not very fond of banknotes. They also have good reason. It is said that bringing silver dollars into a gambling den, even if you lose, you won't be ruined, because you can't bear to bet heavily with silver, unlike banknotes, which are thrown out in tens of dollars without feeling the pain - and each silver dollar has 7.2 fen of silver. Fifty of them stacked up are five inches long, which is much better for "admiring" than banknotes, especially since the latter sometimes run the risk of becoming "fake money"!</p>

<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Since radios have become prized possessions in most upper-class families, the broadcasting industry has seen tremendous growth. At the same time, the production of song and dance troupes has become a case of demand exceeding supply, although dance is absolutely unnecessary in the broadcast studio. Thus, becoming a radio announcer has become a great career path for most female graduates of today's schools, because any broadcast song and dance troupe needs several female members with melodious voices.</p>
<p>Being a radio announcer is naturally better than being a dancer who is hugged by people, better than being a film actress who is played with by male actors, and even better than being a female employee who is treated as a beautiful vase. Because when you are a radio announcer, you only need to sing two or three songs in the broadcast studio. You don't show your body, you only show your face, and you won't be harassed by frivolous playboys. At the same time, the reward is better than that of those who bare their legs and perform grass skirt dances. Therefore, many ladies from well-to-do families have now joined song and dance troupes and become radio announcers.</p>
<p>But even so, being a radio announcer does not necessarily mean that you can avoid bad environments. Especially if you become a popular radio announcer, you will be tempted even more. I have a relative's daughter who is a radio announcer in a certain song and dance troupe. It is said that she receives at least ten love letters every day, and some even call to ask her to go to the movies or have a big meal. She replies to each love letter with a pre-printed letter. As for those who ask her to go out, regardless of whether she knows them or not, she always agrees, but when she goes, she always asks at least three or five companions to go with her, so that the frivolous ones cannot tempt her after paying for the guests.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Brief Notes on Planting Chrysanthemums <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>As soon as the season reaches autumn, there is a vague feeling of emptiness in my heart. Living in this city of only yellow sand and smoky ash, besides some material displays, to find a single green leaf as a consolation from nature is like searching for sweet water in a desert. So, the thought of finding some flowers and plants to grow myself, to make up for this deficiency, has long been present. However, after several attempts, it was almost always a case of "repeated failures." Having learned a lesson, I knew that without empty space or time, it was better not to plant flowers, lest the little lives sprout only to wither away in solitude. Recently, however, I moved, and next to the house, I actually discovered a vacant plot more than two feet square. Looking closer, the soil was still fertile and dark. So, seized by a sudden impulse, I wanted to try my hand again at planting some flowers and plants, and the first thing I thought of was chrysanthemums. I went to the market, where there were fully grown chrysanthemums for sale. Sowing seeds was already out of season, and I was too lazy to wait for the seeds to sprout and gradually grow. So, the fully grown chrysanthemums in the market suited my intention perfectly. I bought several plants with many buds and happily skipped back home, like a child who had received a lovely toy.</p>
<p>My wife, who also loves flowers and plants, gave me a sarcastic remark when she saw me carrying several chrysanthemums back: "You fool!" For a moment, I didn't understand the meaning of "fool." I stared at her for a while, and then she said, as if explaining: "Oh! Some wild chrysanthemums, what kind of famous varieties are they?" But then she added: "Chrysanthemums will wither, I want a flower that won't wither."</p>
<p>"Where in the world is there a flower that doesn't wither? It's like there are no people who don't age," I said.</p>
<p>"Look!" my wife said, pointing with a smile at the mirror, next to which were inserted paper flowers she had made herself. "Aren't those flowers that won't wither?" At this moment, I couldn't help but laugh at my wife's foolishness. Because handmade paper flowers, not being real flowers, are like bronze or plaster statues, not being real people, are fake. At the same time, fake flowers and fake human figures are only a kind of longing and remembrance for the real thing, not a real existence. It is precisely because flowers wither that the value of flowers is revealed. Don't we feel the fleeting nature of youth and the urgency of life? I said to my wife, "Let's plant them together, you are truly foolish."</p>
<p>After planting the several chrysanthemums, I felt as if I had added a lot of busyness to my heart. Every day, as soon as I opened my eyes, I would go and see how much the chrysanthemums had grown? Whether they had more vitality than when I bought them? Every evening, I would also water them, and sometimes I would go with my wife to look at the buds, predicting the day they would bloom. Therefore, the joy I gained from these leaves every day was truly not something that could be bought with the money spent on purchasing them. I could even imagine that a gardener in a flower garden would have to worry much more than the owner of a flower garden, but also get much more pleasure from the flowers.</p>
<p>But half a month passed, and the chrysanthemums were still no different from when I bought them. At first, I thought that because I met with the chrysanthemums every day, it was not easy to see the difference. So, I decided to look at them every two days. Looking at the chrysanthemums every two days, they were still the same. And two of them looked like they were about to die. Naturally, I couldn't help but feel sad for a while. But at the same time, I had discovered the reason why the chrysanthemums were dying. It was because the side of the house was very damp. The sun was blocked by the tall buildings of the neighbors, and there was only a little light at noon, but it only lasted for a few tens of minutes. I couldn't help but sigh for the fate of the chrysanthemums, but I also understood that "chrysanthemums will not bloom in a home without sunshine."</p>
<p>Regarding this, my wife seemed to have found the basis for her philosophy, saying, "The flowers you plant are not thriving, they will wither even if they bloom, what is the point? Only the paper flowers I make are the ones that will never wither."</p>
<p>But at that time, the sadness in my heart was not about whether the flowers would wither or not.</p>

<p>Gold Market Meanders, Resulting in a Draw</p>
<p>Selling Pressure Persists, But Gradually Weakens</p>
<p>Positive News Emerges, Recovers After a Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market resulted in a draw, but the situation was weak in the middle. This was because, under the unfavorable situation of swap spreads, the supply in the market exceeded demand. Rumors were initially bad but later turned favorable. Buyers stubbornly resisted and then rebounded. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market was stable in London but rose in the U.S. The forward silver price in Montreux fluctuated. Exchange rates all contracted. The price of pure gold in London rose three and a half pence. The external forward trading opened, rising from 94 yuan to above 5 yuan. However, major players took advantage of the high price to sell and then fell. The Central Bank's listing was announced, with the U.S. and the U.K. remaining flat, and customs gold rising four percent. The standard price of bar silver rose to 1005 yuan and 40 cents. After the opening, it was quite stable, but the banks' appetite was high, the foreign exchange market loosened, so the supply exceeded demand, and the selling pressure started. However, the 90 yuan level was still maintained. Buyers took advantage of the low price to take action, and it rebounded. The internal market of the banks continued to harden, and people's hearts were difficult to cheer up. The sellers were pressing, and the 90 yuan level was finally broken. Then, due to the scramble by the Dalian gang and others at low prices, the psychology of the industry was inconsistent. The buyers were not discouraged. The HSBC Bank's listing did not move, and it rebounded once. Hedging came again to sell off, and large deals were difficult to close. The silver balance tax was announced, still at 6.25 percent, with the pound exchange rate still calculated at 1 shilling and 5.75 pence, without much impact. The foreign exchange market finally loosened, and again retreated to within 90 yuan, but the buyer's resistance was still strong. Afterward, there was still a rebound, but the rise was short-lived, and again hovered and retreated to within 90 yuan. After this, the foreign exchange market continued to harden, and the US dollar for this month has loosened to above 34 yuan. Although there were few transactions in the market, the overall trend was extremely weak and fell. After the afternoon closing was low, it rebounded, because although there were rumors in the market that China and the UK had established a loan of 20 million pounds, the general psychology was not affected. The afternoon market opened flat and weak, and then gradually tightened due to the tightening of the internal market. Major players suddenly had a buying appetite, and it was rumored that the foreign interbank lending rate had fallen to 3.5 percent, and the swap spread had also fallen to 10 yuan. The buyer's psychology was slightly relaxed and gradually rose. When the 90 yuan level was broken, although there was a setback, it had turned to a prosperous situation. Rumors spread that spot silver had been shipped back from Hong Kong, and the silver supply would no longer be tight. The buyers suddenly came to action, and a major player, Mr. Luo, also bought, and the gold price rose even more. The second report from the Indian silver market was unchanged. Taking advantage of the high price, there was some supply, and it fell slightly, but people's hearts were still hot. Finally, due to the relationship of the closing price, the overall trend struggled. Throughout the day, the market was meandering, and buyers continued to resist. Therefore, the morning atmosphere was relatively weak, and the morning and evening were quite firm. Now I will record the day's market situation.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 993 yuan and 30 cents, which was 50 cents lower than the previous closing. The Central Bank's listing was announced, with the U.S. and the U.K. remaining flat, and customs gold rising four percent. The morning market was quite stable.

<p>Yesterday, the market situation suddenly had no soft state, but the atmosphere in all aspects, probably the current low, dry, and impossible to make up, I am afraid it will not be easy to recover for a while. The foreign interbank lending rate was the same for both morning and afternoon markets, at four corners, the same as the day before.

<p>Public Bonds Surge After Initial Drop</p>
<p>January Futures Trading Begins</p>
<p>Sudden Reversal from the Second Round</p>
<p>Rising from Two Jiao to Over One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw the start of trading for January futures for the 24th year. Market trading was quite active. Although the foreign exchange rate remained at four jiao, this was due to the need for funds for settlement at the yarn and cloth exchange, so the initial auction was still sluggish. Subsequently, HSBC Hong Kong deposited silver to support the Shanghai market in a substantial amount, and a rising trend began. The stagnant situation of the past few days suddenly unfolded, showing signs of being unstoppable. The reversal had been anticipated by reporters for some time. As the rising trend started, good news followed one after another, such as hopes for the establishment of new foreign loans, the Construction Bank buying 20 million, Hu Hanmin setting off for Beijing, and various other rumors. These are not entirely credible, but the future of foreign exchange rates will naturally gradually ease. Today is the day for the financial sector to settle accounts at the end of the month. The foreign exchange rate will not be too small. The market price prospects still have turbulence today, and the result will likely be flat. After this, there should still be a rising trend. Yesterday, the market sentiment was still weak due to the high foreign exchange rate. Issues 16 and Bei continued to sell, falling another two to five jiao. In the second round, the news suddenly turned, and prices rebounded sharply. Salt tax rose by about half a yuan. In the afternoon, the head discount dropped from 4.8 jiao to 3 jiao at the close. After the close, the off-market trading was even more rampant, and market sentiment tightened further. Short covering increased, and the rising trend intensified. The demobilization issue rose sharply by seven jiao. The reporter had warned about the intensity of the reversal. The closing news was still good, and short covering was even busier, rising another one jiao to half a yuan. Throughout the day, the rising trend gradually tightened, with the highest and lowest prices differing by as much as two yuan and several jiao. The overall market price resulted in the 23rd issue soaring by one and a half yuan, while the rest rose by two jiao to over one yuan. The total volume of transactions was estimated to be around 25 million. The results of the gains and losses are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>US Utility Stocks Rebound on Short Covering</p>
<p>A report from the New Fong Foreign Firm states that yesterday (28th), the New York stock market rose due to the strength of utility stocks. Judge Grubb of the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court ruled that the Tennessee Valley Authority had no right to build power plants and compete with other power companies. Short sellers covered their positions heavily, so although the New York City Council levied a 3% tax on public utilities, the result was more than offset. The bond market was strong due to the surge in domestic corporate bonds. The small exchange was also lifted by utility stocks. Although Chicago wheat saw profit-taking by longs, it still rose due to poor weather reports from Argentina and the strength of corn. The total volume of transactions for the day was 1.16 million shares. The Dow Jones New York indexes are listed below:</p>

<p>Record of November Yarn and Cotton Deliveries</p>
<p>10,750 bales of yarn at a price of 181 yuan</p>
<p>9,400 dan of cotton delivered at a price of 36 yuan</p>
<p>The Jinji brand yarn for the November period was listed for trading on June 1st of this year. The first round price was 182.7 yuan. At this time, because North China was actively purchasing coarse yarn, the market gradually showed signs of life. Moreover, the inventory of cotton during the old cotton season was gradually thinning, and prices were rising. The factory felt it was difficult, so they had to take the method of reducing labor to compensate. Therefore, the number of people reducing or stopping work increased daily, the production quantity decreased greatly, and the market gradually stabilized. Later, in mid-July and August, the United States implemented the "Peng Hai An" policy, the cotton fields were reduced, and the price of US cotton rose. At the same time, the financial sector made large profits on wheat and flour, and turned to the yarn and cotton market, buying in large quantities. People's hearts were agitated, and the highest price of standard yarn was seen to be over 189 yuan. Before long, a large amount of silver flowed out, the price of gold fell, and the eastern exchange rate rose sharply. The national currency price of three-grade yarn was only 262.3 yuan. Japanese merchants dumped large quantities on our country's market, and the market price suffered great pressure, and the situation gradually became panicked. In addition, the exchange had thousands of bales of old goods due to expire in recent months. No one welcomed these goods, so the lowest price was seen at 170 yuan. In mid-October, in order to prevent the outflow of silver, the National Government increased the export tax on silver and added a equalization tax. The gold market soared, and prices soared all at once. The banking industry first speculated and bought in large quantities. The market price rose sharply from 170 yuan to 187 yuan. Later, those who made profits settled, and suddenly fell to 178 yuan. Extending to the recent period, due to the purchase by Tongcheng Company, preparing to receive goods, it rose again to 182.9 yuan. As a result, the remaining 10,750 bales were delivered at a price of 181 yuan. It is said that Tongcheng Company alone received 8,800 bales. The goods inspected included 2,000 bales of new goods, 1,300 bales of 20-count Fugui, 100 bales of Hongren, 200 bales of Ren, 250 bales of Baoyi, 200 bales of Shepherd, and the rest were expired goods.

<p>The November standard cotton was listed for trading on June 1st of this year. The first lot price was 33.9 yuan, slightly falling to 33.6 yuan. Later, due to the US cotton government announcing a reduction in acreage, the market price rose. At the same time, a drought had formed in the country, and the market gradually went higher. The yarn market rose due to the start of sales, and the price of cotton became more expensive, reaching a maximum of 37 yuan. However, some manufacturers and Tongcheng Company, in view of the large increase in domestic cotton acreage compared to last year, intended to view the market as low, and threw out a large amount of 120,000 dan, which was heavily pressured. Unexpectedly, the US cotton government's first estimate was released on August 8, and the market price failed to rise greatly. Domestic new cotton production was also good, and cotton yarn was sluggish, leading to the price of cotton dragging. The lowest price in mid-September was seen at 33.2 yuan. Then, in mid-October, in order to prevent the outflow of silver, the National Government increased the export tax on silver and added a equalization tax. The gold market soared for a time, and the rising trend of the cotton market became even more intense. The standard cotton rose directly from 34 yuan to 38 yuan. Later, the longs settled their profits and fell to 34.25 yuan. Unexpectedly, the financial sector bought in large quantities to go long, and the various sources dwindled. Extending to the end of the month, the seller's delivery was insufficient. The last round suddenly jumped five jiao to 36.5 jiao. As a result, the remaining 9,400 dan of goods included Fire Machine Flower, Yuyao Flower, and Hankou Coarse Fluff Flower. A portion was self-delivered, and the delivery price was 36 yuan.

Since the Shanghai standard yarn market price is reported to be good, all parties are showing vitality, and the market price is also higher than the previous month. According to a survey, the yarn inventory of this factory, Yuhua and Minsheng yarn factories, is less than 1,000 pieces each. The First Yarn Factory still has more than 4,000 pieces, but the yarn price has formed a situation of long-term weakness and short-term strength. Although the future is expected to be good, the market sentiment is weak due to the continuous decline of Shanghai yarn in recent days, and it is still determined by actual sales.</p>
<p>Overseas Cotton Market Sees Similar Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton rose due to good news from Liverpool, the government's efforts to facilitate commerce, and reports that trade agreements will continue to be signed with foreign countries except Germany, which caused a good impression. At the same time, the demand for cloth has also improved. The crowd believes that the 25% reduction in planting has been discounted. Once confirmed, transactions will expand. The need for spot goods is now improving, buyers are enthusiastic, and the market is firm and active. Spot goods rose by 10 points, futures rose by 4 to 9 points. British cotton spot goods rose by 6 points, futures rose by 5 points. Indian cotton was firm at first due to purchases by Japanese merchants and futures traders, but later fell back due to profit-taking by European exporters and bulls. Pingguoer and Aomura rose by 2.25 Robi, and Bairuo Creek rose by 1.75 Robi. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 28th):</p>

<p>Flour and Wheat Market Returns to Good</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was generally firm. The quoted price of foreign wheat was 8.1 jiao higher in Chicago and about 1.2 jiao higher in Canada. Furthermore, the factory slightly recovered the call-back orders for this month, and the northern firms continued to trade spot goods. Therefore, market sentiment for near and distant futures gradually stabilized. Although this month's settlement is imminent, trading is still lively. The external market sentiment for distant months is still good due to the limited output of the factory. At the same time, it brought up about 1-2 points. Until the opening in the morning, it was still stable at first. Soon, it was heard that a large number of call-backs were delivered this month. When the foreign exchange rate was high and there were few hedging positions, it gradually fell. Distant months were mainly floating and shorting, and small factories were also seen selling. Each month went back one point compared to the morning, but was still nearly one point higher compared to the previous day. As a result, this month was unchanged, December was up half a point, January was down 2.5 li, February was up one point, and March was up 7.5 li, and April was up 7.5 li.</p>
<p>The futures wheat market, and the domestic wheat market has issued a falling order, and there is no trend of development in trading. Therefore, the entry and exit of each market is still sparse. However, because the selling is not smooth, the price has been held. As for this month, it is already in delivery. It is heard that more than 30 cars have been delivered, and the total number is about 50 cars, all of which were taken by the factory. As a result, December rose by 4 points, January rose by 4 points, February rose by 3 points, and March rose by 4 points. The spot wheat market, high-quality goods continue to hold up 1-2 points, medium-quality goods are as usual. Kaishan Dong Xuzhou wheat is 3.9 yuan, Suzhou Haizhou wheat is 3.867 yuan, a total of 2,400 bags, which were bought by Fuxin Shenda.</p>
<p>Chicago miscellaneous grains, due to profit-taking by longs, being accepted is easy, and the weather in Argentina is bad. The selling price of the December period is 625 to 75 higher than the May period.</p>

<p>River Rice Continues to Fall by a Jiao or So</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various firms were similar to the previous ones, with a total of about 40 firms (with a total of more than 6,000 shi of goods). The market condition was still firm at the beginning, and the situation continued to be clear. The falling trend of various goods was very strong. Later, there were merchants who entered the market and frequently took action. Qingdao firms also continued to import 500-600 bags, and it gradually became tight. The current situation was quite good at that time. As a result, it was difficult to restore the original situation due to the excessive drop in the early market. The prices of various late rice and thick japonica rice continued to be cut by a jiao or so. The imported Du Yang sharp goods were relatively scarce, and the market was flat. Although the Yin Yuan wine was selling, the zero stomach was very light, and it eventually fell by 1-2 jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 20 ships arrived from various river routes, and there were 220-230 river stocks. A small number of white japonica rice went to the tenth floor of the same industry. The stomach of this street was slightly more active than before. The zero stomach of sheep Du Port sharp new white Yuan Yin Yuan is still stagnant. Early thin rice is deserted. The market shape is near a jiao for discounted japonica rice and high-quality materials, a small 1-2 jiao for medium-quality goods, and a small jiao or so for thin rice and early rice. The price shape of the remaining goods is weak.</p>
<p>Foreign Firms Continue to Dump Distant Saigon</p>
<p>2,500 tons of New Saigon Arrived in One Ship</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was very soft. The current foreign rice stood down a small 1 jiao to jiao and a half. Due to the continuous arrival of previously ordered new goods, yesterday the Yangzi ship loaded 1,500 tons of Saigon No. 1 rice, and another 1,000 tons of broken rice, for a total of about 26,000 bags. Moreover, foreign merchants are particularly diligent in seeking sales. Yali Foreign Firm dumped 1,000 tons in March and April, and He Yi dumped 1,500 tons, priced at only 5.023 yuan, which was a small jiao lower than the previous market. All were taken in by merchants in the southern market. The current foreign rice is very tight due to the tight Japanese silver. It is difficult for inland areas to have appetite, so they are watching and not moving forward. This street is also slightly deserted. A total of only 867 bags of Saigon rice were opened throughout the day. The arrival of guest Sen is endless, and the appetite of this guest is also dull. Yesterday, the total transaction was less than 2,000 bags, and the price was also a small 1-2 jiao each.</p>
<p>Only Small Ground Soybeans Have a Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was still dull. Due to silver constraints, the appetite of various firms for transactions gradually stopped, so only the small appetite of Zhe Shao and this street was left. It is estimated that more than 2,000 bags of Hankou Zha beans were purchased, priced from 3.35 yuan to 3.25 yuan. Dalian beans are still stable in price due to the rising telegraph reports and the lack of Shen stocks. Yesterday, Zhuangjia Tundaliao beans were opened at 4.3 yuan, and Siping Street beans were opened at 4 yuan, with a total of 3 cars being traded. There was no market for the rest.</p>

<p>Raw Peanuts Telegram Indicates Price Drop</p>
<p>Qingdao Telegram Indicates Further Slight Decrease of 12 Jiao</p>
<p>According to the initial telegram from Xuzhou, raw peanuts had risen to 6 yuan, while the declared price in Shanghai was 6.7 yuan, which was excessively different from the Shanghai market. Therefore, the merchants had no suitable place for their goods and remained cautiously on the sidelines. However, Guangdong merchants also kept their hands off due to the dull market in Qingdao. Both sides were gradually engaged in a standoff. Only Shandong peanuts were offered at 6 yuan, and Kaifeng peanuts at 6.1 yuan, a decrease of 2-3 jiao from the previous prices. By the evening telegram, the ground price in Qingdao had fallen by another 1-2 jiao, and the market price in the Xuzhou telegram also showed signs of wavering. The market in the future could be expected to decline. In addition, news was heard from customs that the additional tax on raw peanuts might be avoided, but no official document had been received, so it was not confirmed. This is also noted to observe its subsequent development. However, based on the ground price, the market in the future might continue to fall.</p>

<p>No. 3 Fine White Sugar Opens at 17 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's trend turned firm due to a slight rise in customs duties. The Public Association set the price of No. 24 raw brown sugar and white sugar at 18.95 jiao for ordinary spot goods, and 5.2 yuan for imported goods, with transactions occurring. No. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar was priced at 14 yuan, an increase of 5 fen from the previous day, and re-exported goods were quoted at 4.9 jiao. White No. 4 continued to sell 2-300 bags, with No. 3 at 17 yuan, No. 4 at 16.4 jiao, and No. 1 not being offered. Based on No. 3, 17.4 jiao, before and after need to raise 89 jiao, other by reason, still cautious do not out. The New Tide Qing steamship arrived yesterday, with only 1011 bags, a severe shortage, therefore extremely, as soon as open. Mentioned Qing, as thirteen yuan, yellow twelve yuan eight jiao, ten yuan six jiao.</p>

<p>Silk Business Has Been Quite Active Lately</p>
<p>Since the British government reduced import duties on Chinese and French raw silk, silk shipments to England have gradually become smoother. The other day, the Great Britain steamer shipped 415 bales of yellow and white raw silk and 170 bales of waste silk (i.e., silk waste) to London, including 195 bales of coarse silk for transshipment to Mumbai. The Wuxi factory's raw silk, 131 bales with Double Deer and Malu patterns etc., were loaded onto the docks yesterday and the day before, waiting to be transported to foreign trading houses. Trading houses only, white filature warp from entered Shanghai sixty packages.</p>

<p>Sales of Black Iron Sheets in the North Are Gradually Decreasing</p>
<p>The black iron sheet business in the north has been decreasing lately, so there are fewer price negotiations and transactions in the market than before. This is because the weather in the north is already very cold, and they have already prepared for winter sales products, so there is not much purchasing. Transactions in the south are also very meager. Enamelware factories and thermos factories are also making few additions, so the market situation seems to be passing its peak season, and sales are declining. The market price of 18-sheet cargo measuring three feet by six feet is 9.89 jiao per dan, while colored sheets measuring three feet by six feet with 3 to 13 sheets are estimated at varying prices from 9.23 jiao to 10.045 jiao. It is said that only 50-60 dan were offered in the market yesterday. The inventory is quite large, so there is little hope for a turnaround in the market situation this year.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Literary Sentiment <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Shi</p>
<p>What is literary sentiment? This question, after we unanimously acknowledge that sentiment is a characteristic of literature, seems to require renewed discussion.</p>
<p>Sentiment is just an empty noun. It itself has no specific content; its content is entirely determined by how each individual perceives their own life. For example, a blank sheet of paper, dyed red, becomes red paper, dyed black, becomes black paper. Although red paper and black paper are both paper, their different hues affect people's vision, and thus appear distinctly different. Sentiment is the same; crying is a sentiment, and laughing is also a sentiment, yet everyone knows there's a huge difference between crying and laughing. Moreover, even if it's the same crying or the same laughing, it cannot be assumed that the sentiment expressed is the same. What some people laugh at, others often cry at. Therefore, if we simply say that sentiment is an element of literature in a general way, it is far from sufficient. We should further ask: What kind of sentiment is literary sentiment? What kind of sentiment can evoke empathy in readers?</p>
<p>Some people think that literary sentiment is beautiful and surreal. Reality is only cruel and ugly. Only an idealized world can be considered beautiful, and literature should lead people to revel in a non-realistic, ideal life.</p>
<p>Such a view is naturally incorrect, because they fundamentally see literature as the exclusive property of a few, separating sentiment from real life.</p>
<p>Since literature is intellectual sustenance for many people, the sentiment in literature must necessarily be the sentiment of ordinary people, and only this sentiment can evoke empathy.</p>
<p>The so-called sentiment of ordinary people is not some abstract thing, but arises from their actual lives. Sentiment that is divorced from real life is merely false sentiment. An author, if he wants his works to have rich sentiment and deeply move readers, must experience life extensively; he cannot obtain the means solely from books. Someone who has never been hungry will never understand the pain of hunger, and even if they use some scientific knowledge to express it in writing, it would be no different from ladies seeing beggars on the street, just shaking their heads and sighing, without touching their suffering at all. Compare Sinclair and Gorky. Sinclair ultimately could only be an observational socialist writer because he was not one of the common people; he was completely unfamiliar with the lives of the common people. As for Gorky, he himself was a vagrant, so naturally, the sentiment he expressed in literature became genuine sentiment, which would move readers all over the world.</p>
<p>Of course, the sentiment of ordinary people is not a simple thing, nor is it a monolithic thing. Their lives are complex, and the sentiment arising from life is necessarily complex. It is here that sentiment can be simply divided into two aspects: negative sentiment and positive sentiment. Faced with a drought, some people will commit suicide, while others will become enraged and think of other ways to survive. The former is the sentiment passed down to readers from the chivalric novels left over from the old society. This kind of sentiment is poisonous. If the sentiment of literature is to nourish the upward will of ordinary people, then it is necessary to eliminate those negative and poisonous sentiments from the works.</p>
<h3 id="e190">New Guest House on the Shores of Saigon (Part 2) <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Er</p>
<p>Finally, we entered a desolate empty courtyard, with a patio paved with small stones in the middle. Besides the house and us, there was nothing else. What place is this? It's the new guest house, exclusively for detaining new arrivals! Exhausted, we sat down to rest, disregarding the dirt on the ground. But we were even more overwhelmed by this desolate and miserable atmosphere. How exactly are we to be dealt with? Isn't this place like a prison? Thinking of this, thinking of my hometown, I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness in my heart. I looked at the half-new, half-old walls and the disheveled companions, sitting there dejectedly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was a large window facing the road, with large gaps between the iron bars, allowing things to be passed in from the outside. Many Annamese women and overseas Chinese were looking in from outside, many of the latter specifically to see people coming from their homeland. Many items of food were passed through the window slits. Someone was saying:</p>
<p>"It's dangerous. It's so late. The foreigners don't work after hours. You'll have to spend the night in the new guest house!"</p>
<p>Heavens, spend the night! How? Could we really spend the night just sitting on the ground, hungry? I was constantly worried and hesitant. Gradually, the commotion subsided a bit, and everyone had no choice but to sit in silence. Those who weren't getting anything sent to them handed coins out the window to the street to buy some buns and bread to fill their stomachs. My hesitation also wavered. I bought a large piece of bread, blankly preparing for the night. There were too many people, so I was embarrassed to cry.</p>
<p>Finally, it quieted down, and the gray-white dusk turned into night. The foreigners were confident in letting these Chinese people spend the night here. These people also spent the night well enough, spending their first night in a foreign land. But who knows how many people were secretly shedding tears in the darkness, leaving their homes and villages, their golden dreams of a foreign land dashed.</p>
<p>The night wasn't too cold, but there were too many mosquitoes, and there were so many confused thoughts that no one could fall asleep. The women locked in the next room were holding their crying babies, which made us feel even worse. A cold, chilling air rose from the ground, making us shiver involuntarily. Some were even crying, some were murmuring like women, some were shouting and sighing. Thinking about the scene when the ship entered the port in the morning, we felt even more miserable.</p>
<p>These people endured the night peacefully, but the next day they cried out in pain:</p>
<p>"Heavens! Today is Sunday, and the foreigners aren't working again."</p>
<p>The new guest house was still desolate, and inside, these Chinese people were wriggling about. Good Chinese people, why have they suddenly become like prisoners? I was disappointed and regretted it! But fortunately, some people were gritting their teeth and enduring.</p>
<p>Like a large pile of worms, wriggling, they spent the second day and the second night. Most could only move their hands and feet, as if they couldn't speak. No one came to care for us. It was like being stranded in a desolate desert, or being imprisoned in a small cell, without human freedom.</p>
<p>Sunday passed, and on the morning of the third day, this extremely disheveled group of people was driven to a large garden nearby, which was where the officials of the new guest house worked. Men, women, and children were still mixed together. When the office started, the crowd was as crowded as if they were snatching gold. I waited patiently for a long time, but couldn't help but panic, and followed everyone to squeeze forward, and was squeezed into the middle of the crowd. However, after a long time, I still couldn't squeeze through the door of the office. I couldn't breathe and was about to suffocate, so I squeezed back out. I rested for a long time, mustered up my courage, and squeezed forward again. Three or five times, I was suffocated in the middle and retreated in disappointment. Sometimes the people squeezed to the front were beaten indiscriminately by the Annamese, and the large crowd squeezed back like a collapsing dam; but after a while, they squeezed back up again. Children were trampled and screamed for their lives.</p>
<p>In the end, fearing that waiting too long would cause an accident, I braved the risk and squeezed in. Fortunately, I was also squeezed into the middle and mingled in. In the large office, there were many white people and Annamese working. But I didn't know whose desk to go to first. After watching for a long time, I followed others up. The first two were Annamese, and one was taking fingerprints. When I went to the desk, I just stood there blankly, not understanding French or Annamese, and no one told me what to do. What to do? In the end, I saw people holding small coins, looking under the "identity paper" and calling out "coin, coin." I followed suit, and the Annamese paid attention to me, doing the procedures for me, the entry paper, the new paper. The entry paper cost about eleven yuan, and the "identity paper" cost more than thirty yuan. After paying the money and getting the papers, I had to go through several places to sign and take fingerprints, and coins were also needed. The white people were much more imposing than the Annamese. Their gaze was frightening, and I didn't dare to raise my head, let alone meet their eyes. Once, I couldn't figure out whose gate I had to pass, so perhaps I went to the wrong person. Not only did the white person not tell me, but with a thick foot, he kicked me to the ground. This was more difficult than ascending to heaven! There was no explanation, and it was impossible to ask, so how could I know which gate to pass first? Foreigners were really difficult to deal with. I fell to the ground, and blood was about to spurt out. Some eighteen- or nineteen-year-old youths lied, saying they were fifteen or sixteen years old, wanting to avoid paying the head tax (the head tax), but the white people always gave them a few slaps, beating them severely before letting them go, or not letting them go no matter what.</p>
<p>Standing in the office for more than half an hour, I became dizzy. Confused, I took the identity paper and entry paper, walked out of the office, and tears fell!</p>
<p>Why did I come here? I wiped away the tears, asking myself.</p>
<p>Leaving the new guest house on the shores of Saigon, I was numb all over, and the world before my eyes was dark. My legs were sore, my hands were weak, and I couldn't even lift my head.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Occupation and Aspiration <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Mi</p>
<p>A person always goes through selection from their own depths</p>
<p>and tacitly agrees to do one or more things that they are willing to do. But the things a person is doing are not necessarily the things they are willing to do. If we call the things a person is doing an occupation, and the things a person is willing to do an aspiration, then we can say that probably most people are living a life where occupation and aspiration are separated!</p>
<p>This is a common fact that we see: some can only do a little of what they are willing to do in their spare time from their occupation; some have not done what they are willing to do at all and have spent their entire lives; this is truly a great tragedy for modern people! As for the happy ones who live a life where aspiration and occupation coincide, they are probably rare, right?</p>
<p>Originally, doing a kind of work is a manifestation of the vitality of seeking a living. When vitality is expressed in the work that one is willing to do, one feels joy; when vitality is expressed in the work that one is not willing to do, one feels pain. Thus, modern people who are tightly bound to an occupation that is far removed from what they are willing to do are universally shouting out the bitterness felt from deeply tasting the taste of occupation!</p>
<p>Since living a life where occupation and aspiration are separated is painful, then why do most people feel this way and still live like that? Since occupation is not their aspiration, why not abandon their occupation? This can probably be divided into two situations: first, a small number of people cannot get the things they are willing to do, so they have no choice but to settle for second best. Like many ancient people who were not recognized by those in power, they retreated and wrote books or lived in seclusion in the mountains. Second, most people have to take up occupations that are separated from their aspirations for the sake of survival, or they temporarily take advantage of such opportunities, or they want to seek a guarantee of survival in their occupations and then do their aspirations, or they do what they are willing to do in their spare time from their occupations. There are countless people like this. And the reason is that the environment makes people willing to do certain work, but does not give people the environment to do certain work!</p>
<p>The occupations that everyone takes up are exactly the aspirations that everyone is willing to do. In other words, everyone is doing the work they are willing to do. Such a society will eventually come, right? As for mankind, they are always working towards this direction, I think.</p>
<p>At that time, a person will no longer feel bitter because of the separation of occupation and aspiration. At that time, work will not be for the sake of life, but for the service of human society!</p>
<p>Under that kind of life, people will become even greater!</p>
<h3 id="e192">Memories of Life in a Small Inn <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>I remember very clearly that it was last year, during the season when osmanthus flowers were in full bloom, that I had a period of drifting in a place full of troops. I lived in a small inn waiting for a "job," and the days were so long and so dull. Originally, I was unfamiliar with the place, and I was also poor. When people are poor, they naturally have fewer friends, so I always dragged my long legs alone on the cold streets, on the small hills, and in the fields, pacing and daydreaming. It was autumn, the sky was so high and so blue, sometimes a flock of birds would fly across the sky, purple wildflowers bloomed by the stream, and the gentle autumn breeze would brush my face, making a lonely traveler sometimes feel a slight joy!</p>
<p>Living in a small inn for more than a month has given me a lot of memories to this day. At that time, the days were really hard to get through. I was poor, so what could I do to pass those days? So, the seeds of melancholy occupied my heart more and more each day. My heart seemed to be frying in a pan of oil all day long. The days passed by, but the "job" became more and more vague. My father wrote to me asking how my job situation was, and I endured the pain and wrote a moving letter to deceive my father, saying that I would have a job soon. Only I understood the hidden pain at that time. One day, I fell ill. You can imagine, a person who is poor, adrift, and sick will really suffer to death if he is weak. Fortunately, I was a traveler who was accustomed to hardship, and the illness was not very serious. A week passed, and I recovered my original health!</p>
<p>I remember one late night when I was sick, the small inn was as dead and silent as an ancient temple. A dim oil lamp, the size of a bean, accompanied me. I thought of everything in my childhood, I thought of the traces of struggle in recent years, and even more, I thought of the vague future. I was sad, and I shed a burst of lonely tears. Crying is a shameful act, I know. However, I finally couldn't help but shed them, those sour tears, those lonely tears…</p>
<p>Those who have not experienced life in a small inn do not know how much meaning it contains. I used to be in jail, and I think that being in a small inn is just like being in jail, both are the best places to experience life. To this day, I can't forget the rich knowledge that this place gave me.</p>
<p>In the small inn, when it is quiet, it is like an ancient temple in the deep mountains, but when it is lively, there are also those frustrated drifters singing wildly after getting drunk. On the grayish-colored walls are full of popular poems, some complaining about heaven, some complaining about the world, some complaining about fate, some are negative, decadent, romantic… I once copied all these poems into a diary, but later, during an incident, I lost it in a memorable place. Now, almost a year has passed, and I am still so regretful!</p>
<p>Living in a small inn for more than a month was like living for more than a year. The days were really so dull that it was a bit hard to believe. I waited for the arrival of the "job" with an anxious heart, but the "job" finally sank into the sea like a stone and there was no news of it at all. A friend wrote to me saying: "In this society, if you can't flatter and you can't lick, you still have to train your belly that is not used to being hungry!"</p>
<p>So, I finally left that small inn one morning with an even more bewildered heart. The emotions at this time can be described as very miserable.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Tomorrow (4) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— (Written by Joseph Conrad) Translated by Wu Xiangyu</p>
<p>Captain Hagberd had been a coasting sailor all his life. He was one of several sons of a bankrupt farmer, and he went to sea. He had become a master mariner before long, and all his sea life had been spent along the coast. Perhaps it had been an arduous life at first; he had never liked it; he preferred the land with its innumerable houses, and the peace of life lived near a fireside. Many sailors had reason to hate the sea life, but his hatred was purely sentimental—as if his preference for a settled existence had been inherited through generations.</p>
<p>"Many people don't know what they are making of their children when they send them to sea," he would explain to Bessie. "It's just making prisoners of them at once." He did not believe you ever got used to it. The older you grew the more you hated it. What was it? For the best part of your life never to set foot in your own house? You went away right into it without knowing what might have happened. Some people may think that he hated long voyages; but the longest voyage he had ever made would have been one of a fortnight, and during most of that time he had been at anchor dodging foul weather. Directly his wife came into a house and some money to live on (from a single uncle who had saved a bit in the coal trade), he gave up the command of the collier "East Coast" as though it had been a galley slavery. Even after all these years he could count on the fingers of both hands all the days he had been out of sight of the British coast. He had never known what it was to be out in the deep ocean. "I have never been further than eighty fathom off the land," was his boast.</p>
<p>Bessie Carvil had heard all this many times in the front of their cottage, where dwarf yellow trees grew. In the summer afternoons she often carried a chair out on the grass and sat down with her sewing. Captain Hagberd, dressed in canvas clothing, leaned on a shovel. Every day he dug in his small square of earth in front of him. He turned it over and over every year, but he did not "mean to" plant anything "at present."</p>
<p>"I shall never plant anything till our Harry comes home to-morrow," he always said to Bessie Carvil more explicitly. She had heard that formula of hope so often that it awakened in her a vague pity for that infatuated old man.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Tempering of Leisurely Nature <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>It seems that friends who usually love activities have not been coming in and out of my house for two months now. Have they abandoned me, or have I developed a dislike for them? I have never thought about this in detail myself. In the past, I was a person who liked excitement, even when I was sleeping, I would have the noisy, strange four-tube radio on. Sometimes, I was disliked by my family and they would secretly turn it off. The sudden silence would be like pouring a bucket of cold water, shocking my soul, which had just rested, back from a cold dream. Loneliness and I were as incompatible as ice and charcoal. Naturally, I could not live in a lonely realm. However, now, I have endured two months of lonely life, which is truly an abnormal state of affairs.</p>
<p>The result of two months of abnormal behavior is that the radio has been abandoned under the low iron bed, the clock that announces the time has been removed, children have been forbidden from entering my room, and I have cultivated a leisurely temperament in loneliness. Although speaking is people's freedom, even if I encounter loud voices, I want to cover my ears. "Isn't it? It's neither a speech on a competitive election platform, nor the market where hands clap in the exchange, so this kind of howling that cuts through the sky is not needed!" I am secretly cursing in my heart. Many letters and invitations have been put in the wire basket. When I want to reply, my mind vaguely aches: "These are all superfluous things, hypocritically writing some perfunctory admiration and greetings on a blank piece of paper. I don't have any achievements myself, yet I am hypocritically receiving some empty compliments from others. Isn't that simply a reverse insult! Using money or gifts to exchange for a meal and saying some cliché and conventional words that I don't want to say, is that considered socializing?" I deeply hate these superfluous things.</p>
<p>Therefore, I spend my days hiding at home. I bought a small bronze incense burner, lit high-quality benzoin, and the gray, elegant smoky scent wafts through the silent atmosphere. The positions of the hardcover books and untrimmed books in the bookcase have been occupied by thread-bound books with azure and brown covers, with their simple colors and silent postures. The gilded flower frame of the human figure painting on the plank wall has been replaced by Yuan Kewen's regular script and Wu Changshuo's flower and bird paintings. There is often a can of light-flavored Fattal, a pot of clear pre-rain tea, and a small collection of essays on the low table near the sofa. What an exquisite and non-ostentatious arrangement for the desk! Here, you can't smell the foul smell of fame and fortune. However, there is no coffee pot, pipe, violin, and sheet music here. So, my friends have not been coming in and out of my house for two months now.</p>
<p>However, I do not hate solitude and loneliness, I do not admit that I am a decadent and declining youth, and I am not imitating any lofty and unconventional formula for life. I just think that this is a kind of tempering of leisurely nature. "People cannot live without reality, just as fish cannot live without flowing water. Fish love clear water and hate turbid water, so why can't people live in a leisurely environment for a while?" I often meditate in the blue-gray smoke circles of Fattal. "The turbid currents of the world are full of hypocrisy, deception, all kinds of different masks, lust for sex and fame, and infectious germs of the century. If you can't overcome them, then escape. This is exactly my time to temper myself." In this way, I have alienated friends who love activities.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Random Chats on Hairdressing <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Qunying</p>
<p>I am most reluctant to get my hair cut, but Shanghai's barbers are most adept at flattering their customers. For a "task" that could be completed in half an hour, they would meticulously trim and cut here and there as if it were a serious matter, treating your head like a work of art to be fondled and admired, often extending the process to over an hour, which is quite common. However, conversely, there are naturally some customers who enjoy practicing the art of meditation, and even at the highest price, they find it very satisfying. Forgive my impertinent remark, but our female compatriots are the representatives of this group of customers, and they can even have a lifelong record of waking up the earliest, all because of hairdressing. Recently, electric perms have become popular, and it is said that they take two or three hours or more. If you close your eyes and imagine having your hair suspended by threads and then electrified, isn't that just suffering alive?</p>
<p>However, on a holiday, if you have no friends to confide in and don't want to go to the cinema, the best way to pass the time is to go to the barber shop.</p>
<p>The moment you push open the glass door, you are greeted so warmly by the shop owner, and this kind of attentive service is hard to find in any other transaction. After you sit down on the soft barber chair, the young apprentice twists a hot towel and offers you a cup of tea, leaving you with a lingering feeling of being overwhelmed with favor. Then it's the barber's turn to ask in a low voice, and you can naturally nod to indicate whether you want a haircut or a shave, what style you want, and so on. Then, you take a stack of newspapers offered to you and browse through them at your leisure. There, you will find valuable information that you usually don't pay attention to, and it has a different flavor than reading your favorite book.</p>
<p>In this way, time passes quickly. Before you know it, a work of art has already been sculpted. At this time, you feel that you want the final work to pass slowly, as the last moment is so precious! Even when you leave, you feel a little reluctant to part.</p>
<p>If not, if you are too lazy to be interested in anything, you can sit in the barber chair and immediately close your eyes, falling into a hazy sleep. Sometimes you are accidentally startled awake by a loud noise, or perhaps the radio in front of the door happens to play a love song, and you feel that listening with your ears alone is not enough, so you forcefully open your eyes. This state of being half-asleep is something you can't even imagine when lying on a Simmons bed.</p>
<p>I am most reluctant to get my hair cut, but conversely, I have not become a regular at the barber shop because I am too lazy to get my hair cut. So, I often tell the barber "haircut" after and</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>it greatly surprises him that this fellow doesn't know what "shaving" is!</p>
<p>Are there too many people who share my sentiment? When I step into a barber shop, all the seats are often occupied by those who arrived earlier, which makes me feel slightly regretful. However, once you have entered the door, the shop owner is unwilling to let go of this customer easily. He will bend over, extend his hand, and repeatedly say "please," making you feel too embarrassed to retreat. Sometimes you even hear several similar voices saying as if enticingly, "Almost done!" But in reality, perhaps their work has just begun.</p>
<p>They have a long bench placed in an empty space, and many newspapers are piled up there, but you are certainly unwilling to flip through them. The hot towels and tea offered by the young apprentices also don't feel warm, but rather like a form of oppression. In this kind of situation, you must make a decisive decision, and no matter how humble the shop owner's attitude is, immediately exit the door, turn your head and leave without looking back, and go to another barber shop, where you might make a new discovery.</p>
<p>However, many people are unwilling to do this. They have their favorite barber shop, and even more so, their favorite barber. This, of course, has its advantages. Because I have no such experience, I will omit it.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Wind and Dust <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>｜｜Impressions of Beiping, Part Three</p>
<p>Speaking of Beiping, one cannot avoid mentioning wind and dust, as if wind and dust have a great connection with Beiping. The intensity of Beiping's wind and the abundance of its dust are probably due to the region beyond the Great Wall: the area beyond the Great Wall is rich in wind and sand, and when the trees shed their leaves, the wind and sand become rampant.</p>
<p>Now is precisely that time again. The raging winds beyond the Great Wall are sweeping into this ancient city once more. The raging winds bring news of ice and snow, sweeping away the withered and scorched leaves, until the trees are left with only bare branches trembling in the wind. In this way, when another spring comes, the trees will turn from pale yellow to light green, and the raging winds will also become gentle.</p>
<p>I like to watch the wind carrying dust across the vast northern plains. I remember it was during the late autumn. When I lived in the Western Hills, I would often hear the pine branches rustling like the tide. I would often climb up the mountain, straining my eyes to look at the gray plain to the southeast. I stood shaking in the wind, as rugged and proud as the ancient pines, watching the sea of dust on the plain from the mountain peak. The scene and color were truly magnificent. In the near distance, it looked somewhat like</p>
<p>thousands of troops and horses battling on the battlefield. In the distance, it appeared slightly blurred, like looking at a long river from the mountains on a summer morning, with the mist, smoke, and water vapor along the river winding into a white ribbon. It was also like a hundred or eighty large carts traveling across the vast plain, with the dust stirred up by the horses' hooves and cartwheels forming a winding strip. However, this was not as magnificent as the scene in the near distance. One cloud of dust rushed at another, rushing and merging into one before rushing at another. This looked somewhat like ocean waves, but ocean waves are not as lively. I love the first cloud of dust in the thousands of clouds of dust the most. It is very brave and magnificent, moving straight ahead. From it, I think of Qu Yuan's heroic sacrifice: "Come, let me lead the way." The momentum was truly like that. At that time, I would forget myself. I was a brave general, with the sound of the pines encouraging me and layers of dust as my rearguard. What did I have to worry about in the distance? At that time, my mood was truly one of merging with the wind and dust. A person in that kind of realm cannot help but become heroic. Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind" was probably written like that, with a mood of raging wind and storm, like a primitive man facing the wrath of nature and forgetting himself. The wind and dust of the North have given me such an impression.</p>
<p>I think the wind and dust of the North ultimately have the flavor of the North. Zhi er! Zhi er! Like a speeding bullet whistling through the air, the doors and windows tremble accordingly, emitting a rumbling sound, the electric wires vibrate, and the cloth signs flutter. A sign is blown to the ground, and then another one is blown into the street. At this time, Beiping is enveloped in gray. The streets are desolate, and people who are not oppressed by life may be sitting around a roaring stove, listening to the sound of the wind to pass their days in the wind and dust. When you open the door, wind and sand rush at your face. When you go out, you bring back a face covered in black and a nose full of mud. In this way, wind and dust will be cursed. Curse as you may, the wind and dust will not disappear because of it. Beiping will never be separated from the wind and dust, because the area beyond the Great Wall still has plenty of wind and sand. This magnificence and boldness of the wind and sand have shaped the temperament of the northerners. The wind and dust of the North ultimately have the flavor of the North.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Song of a Traveler <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Huishi</p>
<p>Flying with the whirlwind, flying with the whirlwind, flying with the whirlwind to drift east, west, south, and north: look! The fallen leaves are so light, like a speck of dust or two in space.</p>
<p>Singing, singing these poignant words, I hold a broken heart that is difficult to mend, cross the green water, glide over the green mountains, drifting from my hometown to a foreign land.</p>
<p>At night, the northwest wind blows harder and harder, like sharp arrows. Everything on the building is silent, as if covered with a layer of frost, gloomy and melancholic. On this winter night, oppressed by the cold wind, I support my painful shoulder, sit under the dim light, the silent building,茫茫然的, only a little tabby cat is lying on the table rubbing its face with its front paws.</p>
<p>This is a glimpse of my wandering years that have lasted for several years and are still not over. My heart is as depressed as the surrounding atmospheric pressure: intently meditating, there are only patches of scars from life and the endless sorrow of yearning, piercing me in waves of pain.</p>
<p>The thought of the past long, unsuccessful life, and the thought of the uncertain future path, are the most unbearable difficulties recently. I once had the courage to go forward even through boiling water or fire, and I once acted like a tough guy who wouldn't cry even if whipped. However, the endless devastation of fate and my own inherently weak soul have left me without even the strength to groan.</p>
<p>Since hiding away to this place, living among a group of completely unrelated strangers, my daily life consists only of sleeping and reading. I read when I wake up, and I sleep again when I am tired of reading. I don't know how many days have passed like this. However, there is not much sleep that allows me to sleep soundly, and there are not many books that I can read to my heart's content. In this moment of extreme helplessness, the only way to comfort myself is to try to attract the surrounding external objects to soothe my mind.</p>
<p>I am used to it! I have tacitly accepted everything. The dirty and narrow streets, the morning vegetable stalls, the afternoon vehicles and pedestrians, the streetlights like beans at night, darkness filling the entire universe. The mottled red wall of the Earth God Temple, with its doors closed all day long, a beggar in the corner of the narrow alley catching white lice. Everything is performed in a stereotypical way. Ah, is life also stereotypical? Responsibility, obligation, always passing in a stereotypical way.</p>
<p>A foreign land, life in a foreign land is like this, so boring, so tedious. As soon as I think of a foreign land, I can't help but think of my hometown. Let's go back to my hometown! But I have to ask the environment again. Environment, hometown, wandering, foreign land, constantly pressing against my mind, unable to find an answer.</p>
<p>It is said that humans are animals with inspiration, but I only feel coldness. Baseness, hypocrisy, boasting, flattery, the four elements of the art of life, I cannot do any of them, so the instruments of torture I have received are of course deserved. Isn't that so?</p>
<h3 id="e199">Birthday <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Jingjia</p>
<p>Little Sanzi sat alone on the threshold, quietly watching the clouds in the sky. Suddenly, a burst of firecrackers not far away startled him from his thoughts. Driven by curiosity and the desire to join in the fun, he hurried towards the place where the firecrackers were being set off. Several children, about the same age as himself, were scrambling on the ground to pick up unexploded firecrackers. He squeezed in and picked up two or three. Then he wanted to find out why they were setting off firecrackers. He opened his eyes wide and looked in from the doorway, and saw a large red sandalwood table with thick red candles burning like arms, and incense smoldering in the incense burner. There was also a table of very exquisite dishes. The table was surrounded by an embroidered gold-flower table skirt. Several people were happily talking and laughing in the room.</p>
<p>He still didn't understand why they were setting off firecrackers. A snotty-nosed child next to him told him that it was the little master of the house's tenth birthday, and they were worshiping the gods and ancestors. He indeed saw a little child dressed in colorful clothes running around inside, looking very happy. He knew that that was the little master, the same age as himself!</p>
<p>He suddenly seemed to think of something and quickly asked the child next to him, "What day is today?" The child shook his head. He asked another child, and one of them told him, "Today is October 14th."</p>
<p>October 14th! This couldn't help but stun Little Sanzi! He remembered that his mother used to say that October 14th was his birthday. So today was his birthday! And it was his tenth birthday! The same tenth birthday as that little master!</p>
<p>He lowered his head and looked at the two or three small firecrackers in his hand. He thought, "Why doesn't my family set off firecrackers for me?"</p>
<p>He also seemed to remember his eighth birthday. He remembered that day was very happy. His mother changed him into a set of red and green flower clothes, and also gave him five copper coins. At mealtime, she especially made him a bowl of noodles, and he seemed to remember that there were two eggs in the noodles! That day, Mom didn't tell him to go outside to rummage through the trash can, and let him play outside all day.</p>
<p>He also thought of his birthday last year. Last year was a little worse than the year before, because his mother was sick. And Mom said Dad's business was also lost. Although there were no noodles to eat, she still gave him three copper coins, and he didn't have to go outside to pick up scraps of cloth.</p>
<p>But this year! He had almost forgotten his birthday! Not only were there no noodles to eat, but no one gave him even three copper coins. Because his mother had died in March this year. Dad had also married a stepmother, who beat and scolded him almost every day, and didn't even give him enough to eat. Dad was also very different from before, always in a bad mood towards him, not as loving as he used to be. So his birthday was also forgotten by himself. If it weren't for the burst of firecrackers, he wouldn't have remembered it.</p>
<p>But it's better not to remember it! Remembering it... for some reason, Little Sanzi felt a tingling sensation in his nose, and his chest also felt like it was being pressed down by something, making him feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Why is my birthday so pitiful?" he asked himself. He raised his head and looked inside the door, and he saw that little master was eating very pretty cakes, and a moment later he was eating fresh fruit. This made him feel even more sad!</p>
<p>He cried! Tears blurred his eyes. He raised his heavy feet and walked towards his home, wiping his eyes with his sleeve.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his right cheek was hit with a heavy blow, followed by an angry roar:</p>
<p>"Undying little ghost! What time is it? Still not going to pick up some things? Dead body!"</p>
<p>A broken basket and a pair of bamboo tongs were thrown in front of him. The terrifying sound had long scared his tears back. He quickly carried the basket on his back, picked up the tongs, and went out aimlessly.</p>
<p>When he reached the point where he could no longer see his home, tears immediately enveloped his eyes again!</p>
<h3 id="e200">Seagull <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Xibai</p>
<p>The sky is so clear and bright, revealing a pure and pristine blue. Even the wandering clouds dare not sully the pure, virgin-like sacred space. Ah, what a clear and bright sky!</p>
<p>The vast ocean unleashes its voice, singing the song of roaring waves, stirring up the calm water surface into hills and ridges on the sea.</p>
<p>The dilapidated sailboat is rowed by the despondent boatman, its oars creaking and groaning in harmony with the whistling of the northwest wind.</p>
<p>The free seagull flaps its wings and flies in the sky, over the vast sea, over the bow of the dilapidated sailboat, now east, now west, now south, now north. ｜｜｜</p>
<p>Ah, freely flying! Sometimes riding the west wind forward, sometimes turning its wings to resist the west wind and soar, rushing into the sky and then descending to the sea to kiss the high tide.</p>
<p>Oh, has the free tongue tasted what the high tide tastes like? Isn't it a bloody and smelly odor?</p>
<p>Ah, flapping its wings and crying out loudly! Why? Is it to demonstrate against the high tide, or to sing a sorrowful dirge for the dilapidated sailboat?</p>
<p>Ah, the free cry shatters the high tide on the sea, shatters the song of the waves, shatters the creaking of the dilapidated sailboat and the melancholy sound of the west wind!</p>
<p>There are countless majestic and glorious imperial gunboats patrolling there. Ah, seagull, why not flap your wings and fly there, to follow behind the gunboat as its vassal, but instead hover around this dilapidated sailboat and cry out loudly? Ah, it is really to awaken the despondent people in this dilapidated sailboat from their dim nightmares, from the dream demons clinging to the glory of the past!</p>
<p>The free seagull carries the song of free shouting! Oh, awaken, rise up and move forward!</p>
<p>The seagull flaps its wings and flies forward, crossing the dilapidated sailboat, stepping over the hill-like waves on the sea, acting as the vanguard of this dilapidated sailboat, acting as the guide for the boat, leading the boat forward. But ah, this dilapidated and dying boat cannot resist the fierceness of the west wind, and the waves on the sea are frustrated, and it finally cannot catch up with the seagull!</p>
<p>The seagull's wings are a little tired, but it cries out loudly again! Oh, it is as if all sounds have stopped: the waves have stopped singing, the west wind has stopped its melancholy tune, the boat has stopped its creaking lament! Ah, only, only on this sea, in the clear sky, the seagull flaps its wings with a flapping sound, and the sound of its crying awakens all the slaves who are having nightmares, breaking the沉危的, groaning of all low tones!</p>

<p>Opening "Vocational Education"</p>
<p>Vocational skills are most important in life. The unemployed are truly pitiable. China has four hundred million compatriots. There are too many people and too few jobs, a boundless regret. In the past, Premier Sun Yat-sen was perceptive and advocated the Three Principles of the People. The Shanghai Chinese Vocational Education Society stands strong in society. Those without jobs first seek to have one, and those with jobs seek to serve with dedication. Truly, everyone has food to eat and clothes to wear. Benefiting the masses is beyond words. Such an organization is truly admirable. Shanghai should spread its reputation everywhere. Today, magnificent buildings are grandly opened. Remarkable achievements plant seeds of blessings. Many talented people are knowledgeable. They work together to create a peak. I hope you all work harder to cultivate talents for future generations. Talents are selected without omission. Saving the countryside relies on the talents of the masses. At that time, every household will surely recite and sing its praises.</p>

<p>Small business man, Qiao Yunge, thought that although small, it was not trivial. He made a living selling the freshest seasonal fruits on the street every day. He hadn't seen Ximen Qing for many days. Why didn't he come to buy fruit? He asked his son for guidance. He asked Granny Wu at the Purple Stone Street teahouse. It turned out that Ximen Qing was secretly having an affair with Pan, and they were lovingly together all day long. He hurriedly came to the teahouse and found Wang Po speaking unclearly. Therefore, Mother Wang was terrified. Someone shouted from several houses away. He grabbed Yunge and dragged him forward, scolding him as a bandit. Too muddleheaded. Who did you listen to that made you ramble on? Without asking the reason, she slapped him, knocking him down in front of the door, bereft of ideas. Then he scolded the old thief woman. He remembered this hatred. He would rely on his five-inch-long eloquent tongue. He will make waves out of nothing. He will kill the adulterer, the adulteress, and Wang Po.</p>

<p>After Li Taihu was awakened by a passage from Yu Shuicun, he realized that without money, there is no love to talk about. Originally, Li Taihu's pursuit of Qin Xiaoxiang completely followed Yu Shuicun. Now that he has figured it out, Li Taihu packed his luggage and took a job at the Zhonghua Photography Studio opposite the Confucius Temple. The next day, Taihu leaned against the railing alone, staring blankly at the Six Dynasties Store across the street. Among the passing singing girls, there was not a single Qin Xiaoxiang. He only saw Yu Shuicun wandering at the entrance of the Six Dynasties Residence. Li Taihu hurriedly called Shuicun to come to the Zhonghua Photography Studio. Shuicun told Taihu about his plan to return to Jinan. The two talked until dark before Shuicun parted ways to go home.</p>

<p>Topic (1): Looking at Ji Gate by Zu Yong</p>
<p>Leaving Yantai startles the traveler's heart, the sounds of horns and drums clamor in the Han general's camp.</p>
<p>Ten thousand miles of cold light arise from accumulated snow, on the three borders, the dawn colors move perilous banners.</p>
<p>Desert beacon fires encroach on the barbarian moon, beside the sea the cloud-covered mountains embrace Ji City.</p>
<p>Although I was not a pen-wielding official in my youth, I still wish to ask for a long tassel to discuss merit.</p>
<p>Topic (2): Sending Wei Wan to the Capital by Li Qi</p>
<p>In the morning, a traveler sings a farewell song, last night a slight rain made for an easy river crossing.</p>
<p>Wild geese cannot bear to hear the sorrowful sounds, the cloud-covered mountains are even more so when passing through as a traveler.</p>
<p>The dawn colors of the border city urge the approach of cold, in the imperial gardens, the sound of fulling blocks is plentiful towards evening.</p>
<p>Is Chang'an not a place for enjoyment? It only makes the years and days easily wasted.</p>
<p>Topic (3): Ascending the Wangxian Terrace on the Ninth Day, Presented to Prefect Liu by Cui Shu</p>
<p>The Hanwen Emperor had a tall terrace, on this day, ascending to it, the dawn colors open.</p>
<p>The cloud mountains of the three Jin all face north, the wind and rain of the two tombs come from the east.</p>
<p>Who can recognize the gatekeeper of the pass? The immortal of the river has gone and will not return.</p>
<p>I wish to seek out the magistrate of Pengze, and get drunk together in the autumn of chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>Topic (4): Climbing Phoenix Terrace in Jinling by Li Bai</p>
<p>On the Phoenix Terrace, the phoenix roamed, the phoenix has left, the terrace is empty, and the river flows on its own.</p>
<p>The flowers and grass of the Wu palace are buried in secluded paths, the clothes and caps of the Jin dynasty have become ancient mounds.</p>
<p>Three mountains are half-fallen beyond the blue sky, two streams divide White Egret Isle.</p>
<p>All because floating clouds can obscure the view, one cannot see Chang'an, causing sorrow.</p>
