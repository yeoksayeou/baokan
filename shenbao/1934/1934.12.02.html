<p>時評</p>
<h3>爲災區急賑普捐吿市民</h3>
<p>— 季</p>
<p>據八月間政府某機關之調查。本年入夏以後。全國水旱成災。損失已逾十萬萬元以上。受災區域。幾及全國土地三分之二。計旱災十四省。爲縣三百六十九。水災十三省。爲縣一百二十。此外更有八省六十八縣遭蝗災。十二省八十九縣遭風雹等災。災區之廣。損失之巨。皆尤過於民國二十年時。驚動中外之大水災。罹災人民。雖尙無統計數字報吿。但以情理推測。當亦較彼大水災時二千五百萬人爲多。今年災情奇重。由此可見一斑矣。</p>
<p>最蒙天災之影響者。厥爲全年收入不滿三百元之平民。若輩處歷年荒歉之後。農村崩潰之秋。蓋藏早盡。葦瓢屢空。卽在春夏二季。已至典偕度日。寅吃卯糧。勾延殘喘。今復禍不單行。罹此浩刦。秋收絕望。勢必束手待斃。於是家家作牛衣之泣。人人興仰屋之歎。甚至全家自盡。舉室逃亡。二三月來。屢不一聞。最近冬令已至。更爲狼狽。飢寒交迫。慘極塵寰。夫民我同胞物我同與。惻隱之心。人皆有之。軫念災黎。其能不惄焉傷神者乎。</p>
<p>顧時至今日。徒作同情之悲感。究無所補於災黎。誠有悲天惘人之心。當作慷慨解嚢之舉。涸轍之鮒。望救孔亟。報端所載各地乞賑函電。日必數起。大抵情辭悱惻。不忍卒讀誰無父母。誰無妻予。推已及人。斯得之矣。而况一人餓死固可憐鋌而走險。更應顧慮。當今哀鴻遍野。嗷嗷待哺。若不及時救濟。桀黠者流。勢必嘯聚爲患。重貽社會之憂。不幸而至此。顧欲袖手旁觀。獨善其身。亦必不可能矣。</p>
<p>抑又有進者。都市繁榮。本有賴於内地之復蘇。若内地鄕村。經此災荒而一蹶不振。則影響所及。都市亦必永離復興。卽以吾等身居滬瀆之市民而言。實宜飢溺爲懷。博施濟衆。發推解之誠。應將伯之呼。此豈徒爲慈善盡力而已。亦深含有自救之意義在也。</p>
<p>但考滬上今年對於賑災之舉。雖有各慈善機關。積極進行。惟規模較大之勸募運動。則尙待舉行。十月十五日。各界人士。曾集議於市商會。有旱災義賑會之組織。當塲推朝野名流爲領袖。積極籌謀。計劃固似不小。但視前年大水災時期。屢作全市普遍之輸捐者。則仍未免有所遜色。最近市政府有鑒於此。特召集黨政軍機關團體會商此事。乃有上海市急賑各地災區普捐會之成立。定於今日開始辦公。彙集各機關團體代表。通力合作。喚起全滬市民。踴躍輸將。深願本市三百萬市民。咸能聞風興起。慷慨解嚢。熱誠贊助。濟一歲之兇荒。卜來年之豐稔。豈特數千萬災黎。得沾再造。亦吾滬市民之光榮也。</p>
<p>法不與日同流合汚拒絕共同毁海約</p>
<h3>意國表示同樣態度英日舉行私人會商</h3>
<p>（東京）法國比拉代理大使、今日上午十時至外務省訪問廣田外相、關於前次日本勸誘之華府條約共同廢棄事、法國政府正式答復、婉曲拒絕、謂法國亦不滿華府條約之現行比率、曾力主改訂、惟對日本政府提議之共同廢棄、難卽應允云、又意大利大使亦將於下星期與法國同樣答復、（一日電通電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）當茲英美日三國在倫敦進行談話之際、日本要求法意兩國同時宣吿廢止華府海約、英國人士頗爲疑懼、第一恐三國談話範圍因而擴大、立卽將法意兩國牽涉在内、第二法國政府雖不自行宣吿廢止華府海約、然恐其對於東京政府有所舉動、致使日本態度愈益堅决、際此海軍談話轉入技術方面着重在遷延時日之時、英國乃與法意兩國進行外交談判、俾法意兩國勿受日本之影響、惟是法國政府置身於三國談話之外、絕無加以干涉之意、英國人士大可爲之安心、所望關係各國勿以「旣成事實」相加、如往昔在華盛頓海軍會議時所爲可也、此在意大利方面、亦謂華府條約旣許意國裝甲艦噸數得與法國相等、苟非有「奇蹟」發生、亦决無宣吿廢止華府海約之理云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>海軍談話轉入質的討論</p>
<h3>山本提示技術上數字</h3>
<p>（倫敦）日海軍代表山本今日與英海軍參謀長查斐爾爵士有重要之談話、山本以日本對於英國質的問題所可予以技術上答案之數字交與查斐爾、事後山本吿路透記者、渠未可謂更抱樂觀、但渠對於英國技術上見解、現有更明白之了解、渠提供於查斐爾之意見、關於將來海軍談話所可遵循之輪廓者、純爲渠自已之意見、並未商諸日政府、亦未與同僚討論之、此次談話未提出新因素、日本原有提案、毫不受其影響、渠與查斐爾之談話、大可視爲英日二國欲其海軍將來如何之表示云、據山本向查斐爾表示之意見、日本海軍將來必與現所有者大相變更、日本志在積極縮减、惟察今日之談話、山本恐未能有甚大變更、至少未必有驟然之變更、下屆會晤、將在明日華爾頓午餐及打高爾夫球之時、屆時將再討論海軍問題、英外相西門美代表台維斯及史丹德萊皆將參加、山本與查斐爾晤談後、日大使松平旋往晤美代表台維斯、吿以山本與查氏之談話情形、雖山本對於前途似未抱過分樂觀但聞者表示滿意、以爲日人現</p>

<p>英日異同各點</p>
<h3>削减主力艦英有難色</h3>
<p>（倫敦）昨日日英會談時、深信日英間技術的已得一致不一致之結論如下、（一）英國爲防衛散在的領土、擬擴張巡洋艦驅逐艦等、日本認此與防禦的艦種相等、表示同意、又英國希望將巡洋艦五十增至七十、如係意義輕洋艦之增加、日本方面準備考慮而承認之、（一）關於主力艦、英國方面對低减現在之水準，頗有難色、日方則認三國海軍爲純防禦的、始能達到眞正軍縮之目的、故有低减之必要、對英國之增加輕巡洋艦、雖可表示承認、然必消减主力艦、與此增加相殺、始有考慮之餘地、於此狀態之下、查斐爾之主力艦新造計劃、與山本代表之間、意見懸隔、至爲明顯、（一）關於將來之建艦、若爲自主的宣言、苟其契約條項不妨害日本之平等權要求、準備考慮、且暫行期間定爲五年、亦不反對、（一日電通電）</p>
<p>日本施展手腕</p>
<h3>力避導入政治問題</h3>
<p>（倫敦）先週來之英美會談、有主張導入政治問題、以牽制日本平等權要求之意、乃日本代表部巧妙展開局面、打消英美之計畫、同時岡田首相廣田外相主張澈底的軍縮、表示日本將爲世界軍縮之選手、故英國極贊賞日本外交作戰之成功、（三十日電通電）</p>
<p>維持現行率美國堅不放鬆</p>
<h3>對廣田言論表遺憾</h3>
<p>（紐約）各報對於日本廣田外相昨日在日本議會所發表之演說、認爲不足以鼓勵倫敦海軍談話使有成立妥恊之望、因此多抱遺恨、美國政府對於原有之五五三海軍比率、則抱定决心予以維持、斷不放鬆、如日本單獨廢止華府海約、則美國從目前起、至一九三六年底華盛頓條約實行滿期時爲止、除現在建造中之軍艦六十八艘外、當再建造新艦七十八艘、至於美國一般與論、對於海軍問題態度極爲鎭靜、甚且加以淡視、反之對於内政問題、則關懷較切、衆院海軍委員會主席文生日昨發表宣言、謂日本如宣吿廢約、則美國必仍維持五五三比率、此後日本若建造軍艦三艘、則美國當建造五艘云云、美國輿論或謂文生此項宣言、實屬無裨實際、則以未能誘使日本趨於妥恊也、此外參院外交委員會主席波拉表示反對軍、</p>
<p>備競爭、謂英美日三國目前財政情形、同感竭蹶、在法理上幾可宣吿破產、如尙欲從事軍備競爭、實有類瘋狂、爲今之計、當向支付軍費曁爲國家流血之人民徵詢意見而後可云、最後明尼蘇達州工黨參議員西蒲斯底得則恐英國與荷蘭對於目前事變、關係較美國爲切、或謀不利於美國、此種意見、大率出於農業區域人士、彼輩自大戰以遠、及戰債問題發生之後、對於歐洲國家不復信任、故有此種疑慮也、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）法外長賴伐爾今日以宣言書對衆院宣讀其中涉及當今各急要問題、賴氏促請德國重入國聯、並籲請希特勒今旣聲明其對和平之志願、則應效行法國在東歐所施之政策、法國决不接受德國重整軍備所造成之事實上的局勢、縱德國决議返至日内瓦、法國亦不稍遷就、法國與蘇俄關於保衛歐洲和平事、雖意見完全相同、但兩國間將無雙方的諒解、法意之親善或將擴及歐洲各國、而不擯絕任何國、但目下之疆界必須維持、法國俟至以爲國家可臻安全時、自將縮减軍備云云、（三十日路透電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）本日衆議院討論外交預算案、外長賴伐爾發表演說、謂「法國本身利益、實與和平利益相符合、若欲予以維護、必須國力强盛而後可、而秩序之維持與財政之健全、又屬國力强盛之要素、歐洲人心惶惶、各國人民均要求當局能以實現行爲、維持和平、勿僅以空言表示希望、賴伐爾欲在廣大之範圍内參加組織和平、因而調和各國之工作、關於意大利與法國接近問題、賴伐爾謂意大利與法國對於和平具有同一願望、自應進行談判、俾雙方交誼愈臻密切、但談判之際、必須設法保證意大利與小恊商各國能相接近、尤其是意大利與南斯拉夫之接近、否則談判目的卽未能完全達到、法意兩國相接近之善果、當使各親善國家均亨受之、俾歐洲有一廣泛團體咸受其惠「卽爲法意　商臻於鞏固計此項原則亦不可任其有所犧牲」賴伐爾繼稱、法國對於同盟各國素皆忠實、尤以對於馬賽血案中慘遭不幸之南斯拉夫爲然、至因保障奧國獨立而進行之談判、當務使其鞏固中歐和平、賴伐爾繼談及東歐互助公約謂政府對於此事亦正在進行談判、凡抱有和平目的之國家、法國皆以大公無私之態度與之合作、而不問其内政是吾與法國相同、此項目的不外在東歐方面維持和平、賴氏之言曰、「關於東歐互助公約之談判任何國家均可參加、其目的亦非反對任何國家、惟有一種原則爲人人所當承認者、卽現行疆界應予維持是也、」賴氏又稱、法國與蘇俄携手、其用意正在維持東歐和平、使人人感受其惠此乃公開之事「吾人曾邀請德國參加互助公約之談判、此後並當邀請之、凡公約所能畀予各國之保障、德國亦能享有之、」賴伐爾繼稱、德國領袖兼總理希特勒曾表示和平志願、法國請其參加東歐互助公約、正欲以其志願成爲實現行爲也賴氏以爲戰爭若果發生、必將延及全歐各處斷難限於歐洲某一地帶、今如多訂　助公約、直至歐洲各國悉數包括在内則爲法國自身計、旣可减少戰爭危險、而國際信用亦因以恢復、國際信用乃各國限制軍備縮减軍備所必不可少之條件也、關於和平組織、希望德國能以參加、希特勒旣屢以和平爲言、則對於和平組織當然不能拒絕、而「參加和平須以德國全部精神力量赴之、緣德國合作對於歐洲安全及其前途、實有决定之關係故也、」賴伐爾又謂、法國行動决不逸出國際組織範圍之外、（指國聯會而言）法國視國聯會之發展、爲維持和平必不可少之條件、至於薩爾問題、法國要求其他各國出而襄助、以便維持該處秩序、賴氏最後謂、有人以爲國際間因維持和平所作努力、趣旨不一、因而發生憂懼、渠希望此種錯誤之心理從此消滅、至於英法兩國密切合作、乃歐洲和平之主要保障、現在兩國意見完全相同、實堪慶幸云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>川省財政已有辦法</h3>
<p>據孔氏談、關於整理四川省財政問題、迭經本人在京與四川善後督辦劉湘、數度會商、現已議有具體辦法、但非發行公債、亦無所謂補助費、蓋四川係中央統治下之一省該省財政上旣發生困難則中央政府、自當代籌　法、</p>
<h3>滬市存銀三萬萬元</h3>
<p>孔氏繼稱、現據報吿、上海各銀行存銀、計共三萬萬、内華商各銀行、佔百分之八十一、外商各銀行、佔百分之十九、足證外傳滬地存銀缺乏云云、絕對不確、</p>

<h3>赴菲島考察僑務</h3>
<p>孔氏繼稱、日來外間盛傳、中央銀行將在海外設立分行云、殊非事實、蓋中央銀行、乃我國之國家銀行、按之國際通例、一國之國家銀行、絕對不容在他國設立分行、如事實上確有此項需要、亦祇能設一代理處、至財政部總務司長許建屏、此次奉派、前赴菲列濱各地、係爲考察各該地之僑務商務、此外並無其他任務、</p>

<p>廣東林局長馮銳前晨返粵</p>
<h3>發表復興蔗糖事業計劃</h3>
<p>廣東農林局長馮銳爲復興蔗糖、於上月十二日低滬、接洽銀行投資、及推銷免稅等、茲已於前晨、乘中國航空公司飛機回粵、並對新聲社記者、發表復興糖業計劃、分誌如下、</p>
<h3>復興計劃</h3>
<p>復興蔗糖事業、貴有整個之發展、故先就粵省適宜於蔗糖事業之地、劃分　五個蔗糖營造區、一曰廣州區、番禺·東莞·順德·南海·及珠江三角洲一帶屬焉、二曰惠陽區、惠陽·博羅·海豐·陸豐等屬焉、三曰潮汕區潮陽揭陽·惠來·普寗·等屬焉四曰徐聞區徐聞·海　·等屬焉、五曰瓊崖區各縣屬焉、五區各地無論氣候土宜、皆極適宜於蔗糖事業之發展、苟能聯鑣驂靳、同策進行、糖業復復興、固旦夕間事、惟以經濟與人才及交通市塲之關係、不能不分别緩急次第舉行、故第一年先　備成立者爲廣州·惠陽·潮汕·三區廣州區設蔗糖廠二、惠陽區潮汕區各一、其開辦費及歲出臨時費共達九百四十萬二千餘元、計第一年廣州區之蔗糖廠、每日共榨蔗一千五百噸、製糖一百五十噸潮汕區日可榨蔗五百噸、得糖六十噸、惠陽區倍之、合計每日共榨蔗三千噸、得糖三百六十頓合六千零四十八担、以第一年純利所得、爲第二年投資之用、計第　年開辦瓊崖徐聞各區中營造塲、經費約　九百萬　、則政府祇籌三百餘萬元、」即足以濟事、至以第二年純利所得、爲第三期投資之用、尙屬綽有餘裕、三年計劃完成、每區各有煉糖廠三所、每日出糖約逹千噸、幾可以供　國之用、如是、則每年購糖費之三萬萬元、不致爲外人掠奪以去、其直接間接、裨益於國民生計者、實非淺鮮也、</p>
<h3>機塲設備</h3>
<p>廣東各區蔗糖營造塲、自奉令籌設後、以新式機器購買費爲數不貲非粵省財力所能勝任、爰與外商定分期付欵法、計第一年訂購者廣州區新造廠全部機械及建築費之一部共約値一百五十九萬三千七百七十元、附設酒精廠計値二十萬零　千七百八十四元、市頭廠全部機械及酒精依　廠、共値　百七十九萬二千四百元、另建築費五十三萬零零二十五元、惠陽廠機械及建築費之一部、共値二百九十七萬五千元、附設依　酒精廠値三十五萬九千六百零七元、潮汕廠與廣州區之新造廠同、以上以粵幣伸算、計値一千零四十五萬零一百元、供分二十期擬付、以　月爲一期、計本年付欵不過全額中之一小部、而十二月初間、即可同時製糖、收入激增償還　欵、自屬綽有餘裕矣、故以廣州區計、每日可榨蔗一千五百噸、出糖一百八十噸、另兩酒精廠、日得火酒　十五噸、其中指揮監製、皆　西洋專家、以董其事、</p>
<h3>蔗糖原料</h3>
<p>本人奉命赴菲列濱、視察糖業時　對於　良蔗種設法搜集計得五十二種、皆世界公認爲最良之蔗苗、回國後、即設法藩殖、租黃埔永安圍爲優良蔗種蕃殖塲、得地四百餘畝、又以栽培甘蔗、最重管理、以夏威夷蔗論、現時每畝產量不過八九十擔如能採用最集約耕作、則每畝可產一百六七十擔、故於塲内舉行栽培法表證、以誘導農民、又以吾國糖蔗向祇施用淡肥、而不知參用鉀鏻、故結果常全蔗質不良、糖份减少、故又於塲内舉行肥料適量表　、以資倡導、一面復以優良蔗種、分給農民、以期推廣、又爲救濟農村、並充足本塲原料蔗起見、復訂立貸欵植蔗法、凡農民植蔗而缺乏資本者、由各營造塲貸以相當資金、月息八厘算、將來蔗出所穫、即以之售與營造塲、木蔗每擔九毫、竹蔗每擔七毫、故又名預約種蔗、且蔗性耐旱、收成最佳、每畝木蔗可收一百擔、値　幣九十元、連蔗種可得百元、其獲利之高、與投資之穩固、實爲農作物中不可多得、</p>
<h3>推銷踴躍</h3>
<p>本年十一月中、廣惠兩區糖廠皆同時開始榨製每日出糖三百噸、月得十五萬担、以廣州市面而論、短時間自不能立銷此巨量之糖而糖廠方面、又純靠現欵與農民　蔗、故銷路問題、其影響於糖廠與農民者、實至重大、爲　劑中面計、自當以四十萬担運滬推銷滬糖商亦以粵省各糖廠成立、實爲我國糖業界闢一新紀元、前曾派員赴粵作詳細之調查認爲設備完善、並爲愛護實業救濟農村計、對於此種國產蔗糖之運滬、尤樂爲擁護推銷將來國產蔗糖能推銷各埠其影響於國人之　感者、亦全鉅、故樂與粵省糖廠合作者至形踴躍、</p>
<h3>增稅以後</h3>
<p>民一十一年、中央政府鑒於環境之需要、增加洋糖入口稅、樹復興我國糖業之基礎實爲完美之措施、惟粵省以　汶紛歧、歷年走私者異常猖獗故仍無補於吾粵士糖之復興據加稅後、民二十二年之粵海關統計洋糖入口數量、祇有一四二八七担、而在未加稅之十九年之報吿、則有七八五·九三六</p>
<p>担、其比例率幾爲與五十五之比、非加稅後洋糖入口銳减、特私梟偷運耳、據民二十二年香港出口統計運往澳門之白糖、約六十萬担、運往廣州灣者約三十萬担、以澳門之入口論年銷　萬担、已覺有餘、其餘皆私運於吾粵内地、不問可知吾粵以地勢關係、私梟出沒貪夫殉財自無所不用其極、政府雖嚴厲處罰精密邏緝、仍不能挽救、</p>
<h3>統制辦法</h3>
<p>吾粵當局有見及此、爰毅然决然採取糖業統制政策凡營業之營運、槪中政府設推銷處、以統制之劃全省爲十二營運區擇省内大糖商十人爲營運部主理全省之營運營運商下有分銷部、及零沽店、凡省營糖皆須存於所指之公倉、然後轉運於各地、運銷時有　銷證、無證者即屬私運、按其罪之大小分别處罰糖價定自推銷處營運商除酌加運費外、不得居　、於是私運雖能進口、亦不能流銷市　、庶絕私梟之途又吾粵自　制糖業後即極力恊助海關加撥艦隊與鉅欵於緝私　處、以增加緝私力量、粵省私梟林立、海關對於糖稅之收入、已極微薄、粵省府統制糖業所入、乃取於私梟之手、挹彼注茲、於海關絕無所損而自嚴密緝私組織後、破獲其他　品之私運者、　數　鉅海關收入、因而轉增、是則統制糖業後、海關方面、亦受其利也、惟各糖廠、雖先　　立、然以原料蔗關係、須本月初、始能開始　　在靑黃不接之際、故購買原料　、煉製白　　　應社會之需要、盈餘所得、一歸之公、吾粵年來栽雜捐三百　萬、其所挹注、多取給於此、爲過渡時之良策焉、</p>
<h3>乘機回粵</h3>
<p>馮局長低滬後、即與上海銀行　經理陳光甫、副經理鄒秉文接洽投資粵省　業决定由上海銀行　導農民組合作社辦理甘蔗生產貸欵、先自番禺試辦、並晋京向財政部陳　粵產機製糖免稅、在明年初辦期間中央　表示扶植起見、已勉予允許、關於興發機製蔗糖　廣計劃、並商得經營糖業華僑某鉅商於經濟技術人員均予恊助即可按　三年發展步驟、　　進行唯惟銷方面、本市糖業公會各會員雖甚　　極力推銷、尙有某種問題未能解决但該糖廠指日即須開機馮局長故已於　晨乘中國航空公司飛機回粵、</p>

<p>勞作一科爲中小學課程中最新之名詞、究其實際、似較昔日之工藝或手工範圍爲廣、同時實施上亦較從前爲困難、提倡以來、時期不久、惟世人之注意是科者不乏其人、雜誌報章、往往發表其新頴之主張、即赴國外考察敎育者、亦每以此爲其目標之一、際此職業敎育展覽機會、自應共同表現其設施之眞相、以供從事敎育者之研究、此次送展之成品、種類繁多、優劣互見、有以本地特產見稱者、如湘南之刺綉、福建之漆器江西之陶瓷、有以模型敎具擅長者、如上海浙江河南等省市之軍用品模型、河北福建等省之敎學用具、有以敎學程序表示逐步製造方法者、如中華職業學校之機械木工成品、河北工學院附設職業學校之應化及染織作品、有以工讀敎育爲普通中學之設施表現其特殊勞作之精神者、如北平求知中學、有以創造能力發明紡綫機者、如平市之韓氏女子職業補習學校、種種優異之點、不　而足、</p>
<p>吾國職業敎育、如刺綉縫紉、如染織地毯如金工機器、如陶瓷漆器均有其些微之表現、獨國本攸關之農業、則殊少成績、年來各級政府提倡農業不遺餘力社會人士、亦無以此爲復興農村之要圖、雖高等農業、敎育機關、不乏相當成績、而負推廣與改善初步農業之中等技術人員、則迄未有所成就、是則本屆展覽會閉幕後之應討論的問題也、</p>
<p>刺綉·漆器·地毯三者爲吾國手工業之特殊出品、惟因其工作繁瑣、時間久而出品數量少、價格高昂、每非一般民衆所能享用、幾成爲休閒級之奢侈品、似應從事於簡易平凡適合於普通應用之研究、而使社會多數人士有購買之能力、以求技能之普及、出品之推銷</p>
<p>勞作敎育、小學注重於勞働習慣之養成、中學注意於工作技能之陶冶、惟因缺乏適當師資、敎材悉仍其舊、學習者興趣索然且多因循塞責、以敷愆部章爲能事者、甚有並此項科目而不列、認爲小數時間、决不能造就技能、不如改授他科尙可獲得些許裨益者、其見解之偏、無待贅言、近年以來、歐洲中學、頗注意於金木兩工之作業、不特爲一切科學之基本工具即國民軍事敎育上亦無不以此爲主要技能吾國各地中學、其能有是項適當設施、如木工工作台與鍜工機械工塲者、鳳毛麟角、往往以黏土·紙工·竹工·鐵絲工·籐工爲其普通之練習、以其較而易舉、爲一般舊式手工敎員所能勝任也、數月前江蘇某中學校長鑒於日本中學生之從事於科學工具之製造、足以提高學生對於理科敎育之興趣、亦從而仿效、用意甚是、其實中學勞作科敎材、正應循此道而設施、以發展學生創作之精神、</p>
<p>小學勞作雖不能如中學之艱深、但所有舊式厚紙工·荳工·剪紙工·黏土工及無敎育意義或實用價値之作業、均應設法剷除、代以園藝、家禽　養、及普通農作物種植或含有簡易實用之工藝作業、於練習簡單手藝外、兼養成團體生活之習慣、故中小學勞作科師資之有效培　、敎材之切實研究、及勞作科設備之最低標凖、亦爲本屆展覽會之兩待解决問題、秋間友人某君曾著文引起社會之注意、謂勿徒以展覽爲　其職　、固</p>
<p>另有見地也、</p>
<p>此次各省市送展之成品、共二萬九千七百餘件、參加者凡二十五省市、所送成績、自二十件至三千二百餘件不等、以全國區域如是之廣、區區之數、自不算多、但如所送作品、均爲有意義、有價値、並爲學生平時作業之表現則雖少亦多近年以來、敎育上問題因科學進步而逐漸增多、中小學手腦並用之勞作敎育、更因其内容廣大而增加其困難、吾人參觀此次展覽會、應迅速的引起我們敎育上須注意之點、而共謀有以解决之也、</p>

<h3>史高塔杯次賽東華二次大敗英尼斯</h3>
<p>五對零東華得複賽權</p>
<p>英尼斯實力不過如此</p>
<p>英尼斯前週在甲組聯賽中、以○對四爲東華所敗、昨又與東華作史高塔杯次賽於逸園上半時東華連獲三球、氣熖萬丈、休息後、英隊率師固守、但終於不濟、又失二球、成五對○之局面吿終、是戰東華雖少一曹秋亭、然充補此缺之賈幼良、猛勇活潑、殊能稱職、後衛新人陳公璵亦矯健可喜、英尼斯之中堅湯姆遜、進攻退守、的是將才、該隊如無此人、則負球之數目、當更夥矣、觀衆約五千餘人、</p>
<h3>英隊實力平平</h3>

<h3>什麽呌做難</h3>
<p>— 玲</p>
<p>難的反面是容易，容易的反面是難；做便是容易，不做便是難。難的事會使你成功，因爲難的事情一定要用腦子去想，容易的事情你以爲輕易，就不去想，恐怕做成的事，也不會好的。</p>
<p>這是什麽緣故呢？就是一個是用心做的，一個是輕易做的，他所得到的結果，自然大不相同了。難的事情，要用你聰明的腦子去想，想好了然後實行，那麽天下的事，沒有一件事是難的了，容易的事，你隨意去做，便沒有好的結果，足見容易的事，不一定都是容易的。俗語說：「只要功夫深　鐵杵磨成針」，在這句說話中，就能知道難的事，須有很長的時間去做，纔會成功。</p>
<p>所以我們在幼年時，要知道做就是容易，不做便是難的這句話。我們不因爲難而不做，亦不因爲容易而隨便去做；反過來說：我們因難而用心去做，因容易而努力去做，養成了這樣的好習慣，將來在社會上服務，無論難的事情，容易的事情，都會做了。</p>
<h3>什麽是我？我是什麽？</h3>
<p>— 庚健齋夫</p>
<p>小朋友們！先聽我說個故事：話說有一個公差押送一個犯罪的和尙到上司衙門去，途中宿在客棧裏，公差倦了，一夜酣睡。那和尙把镣銬摔斷，又把那酣睡着的公差頭髮剃光，一溜烟逃了。公差一覺醒來，摸摸自已的頭，不覺大驚道：『啊呀！和尙還在這裏，我到那裏去了？』</p>
<p>這個公差眞是昏憒，頭髮沒了，便連自已也不認識了。但是諸位想想：世界上有幾個人眞能認識自已的本來面目呢？有幾個人眞能永遠保持他自自已的本來面目呢？</p>
<p>世界上的一切，都刻刻在那裏變化，二十世紀的世界，已經不是十九世紀的世界，更不是紀元以前的世界了。人呢，今日之我，便非昨日之我，更非初出娘胎的我了。待到明日明年，今日今年的我又同那裏去尋找呢？這個刻刻變演的肉體的我，究竟是不是我呢？</p>
<p>一朶花兒開了，結了果，花兒不知往那兒去了。果子落在泥裏，長起新樹木來，果兒又不知往那裏去了。又是開新花，結新果。我們自已認識的我，也便是一朶花，一個果罷了。究竟「什麽是我？」「我是什麽？」</p>
<h3>菊花黃</h3>
<p>— 偉華</p>
<p>菊花黃，黃似金，</p>
<p>姐姐折一枝；</p>
<p>「爸爸拿去賑災民！」</p>
<p>菊花白，白如銀。</p>
<p>妹妹折一枝；</p>
<p>「媽媽拿去賑災民！」</p>
<p>賑災要白銀，</p>
<p>安得千千萬萬菊花盡化銀？</p>
<p>賑災要黃金，</p>
<p>安得千千萬萬菊花盡化金？</p>
<h3>地球上著名的洲洋</h3>
<p>— 苦</p>
<p>小朋友，地球上著名的洲洋，在我們從前的敎科書上，都說着亞細亞洲、歐羅巴洲，阿美利加洲，阿非利加洲，海洋洲的五洲，和太平洋，大西洋，印度洋，北冰洋，南冰洋，的五大洋。但是，據最近探險家的考察之後　已增加了一個大洲，减少了一個大洋，所以現在的地球上，我們應該說有六大洲，四大洋，六大洲就是，亞細亞洲，歐羅巴洲，北阿美利加洲，南阿美利加洲，阿非利加洲，海洋洲，四大洋就是：太平洋，大西洋，印度洋，北冰洋。</p>
<h3>初冬應時的小玩意</h3>
<p>— 芷園</p>
<p>蘭花燄火　吃過橄欖核，一一存留，曬乾，用針　入核的尖端小孔，把它扞在燭臺蠟燭上，核的尖瑞須靠近燭心，所用的燭，要舊式的燭，勿用洋燭，及點着火，就不斷的噴出蘭花瓣的燄火來，一片一片的形式，竟如蘭花一般，這個理由，係因核中細孔藏有空氣，經燭火包圍燃燒，裏面空氣急迫的逃出，繼續迸射，所以就放出那像蘭的火花，不須人工製造，居然也能，請人欣賞這好看的燄火了。</p>
<p>鐵菊開花　平常遇到紙烟開聽時，劃開下來的圓形洋鐵片，一一留着，每片以彩色紙或粉白紙糊在兩面，無論何色均可，不過兩面要糊一樣的，俟乾透後，在四週翦成細絲條，上上下下的移開，便成一朶名呌「森針」的形狀菊花了；當中鑿一孔，用鐵絲穿上作花柄，同時製了許多朶數，挿入花瓶，遠看與眞菊無二。</p>
<p>香個巧盒　香橼到要乾縮時候，不必棄去，在近蒂處，切去全個四分之一，將當中的子和瓤挖出，細細揭去裏面的白皮，口上向裏摺一捲邊，以後按四方或六方或八方等分劃，用手慢慢的捻成方形，方形須求正確，勿各方寛窄不等，致礙美觀，惟工作非在倉猝時間所能成功，不必性急，可分作多次，在　閒暇時，繼續爲之，及至製成，擺在透風處，經過長久時間陰乾，就成了一個美術盒子，并經久耐用，多年不壞。</p>
<p>橘子花籃　大廣橘在近蒂處切去　個四分之一，用小刀及匙子取出果肉啖食，橘皮外面，以手工雕刻方法，刻出美麗的花紋，就成功一個巧小玲瓏的花籃了：口旁穿四小孔，　線掛着，再放幾枝鮮艷的金錢菊小菊花，更覺有趣。</p>
<h3>買襪不用足量</h3>
<p>— 吳雄劍</p>
<p>小常識　天氣漸漸在冷起來，小朋友脚上的絲襪·或綫襪·已熬不往寒冷，大槪都要呌爸爸媽媽去買幾雙綫綫襪或者羊毛襪了。假使爸爸媽媽允許了你的請求，挽了手走到舖子裏去賣襪子，那時顏色也選好了，價目也講好了，但是不知道這襪子的大小合不合？小朋友！</p>
<p>我敎你一個法子，你不必脫去了你的鞋子，坐在凳上，然後再量長短；只要伸出個拳頭，呌爸爸或媽媽一手握住襪的頭，一手握住脚跟處，如果圍繞起來，正好合你的拳頭，不大也不小，這襪子的大小就是正好了。不信。你試試看。</p>
<h3>兒童科學講座住屋</h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>無論蟲魚鳥獸，只要是動物，總曉得找個藏身的地方。我們人類的生活中，這住的問題，便更重要了。小朋友都曉得，我們是住在屋裏。而屋的種類却非常多尤其是屋經過了詐多的改良，才成了現在的式樣。</p>
<p>我們爲什麽要住屋呢？小朋友們一定也曉得回答：第一是避風霜雨雪，第二是保障安全，人類在初民時代是穴居野處的。（；圖一）但是這樣居住野獸要來侵襲，風雨不能躱避，於是架起樹枝搭成房屋。像現在南洋羣島土人，把房屋利用着樹枝架搭起來一樣。（圖二）不過，這種木屋，比較穴居野處果然進步，而大風雨一來臨，便有傾覆的危險，許多能升樹的野獸，還是要來傷害，所以不得不另外想出方法來防禦，於是就進一步而用泥草來建築房子。也有用木板蓋成的，（圖三）這時的人民，大都移居在河流附近，但是泥草的房屋，經水一汜濫，便易被冲毁。以後所改良的房屋，是用磚石作材料，而且發明了樓屋，（圖四）比較上古時代的房子，眞大不相同了。</p>
<p>近年以來，因爲地皮價格昻貴關係，房屋的面積，不容易發展，於是就建築着高層的房屋，而材料也更堅固，利用水泥鋼骨來建築。（圖五）人類生活的進步，住屋自然出跟着進步的。</p>
<p>因爲住屋是生活上的需要，另外有一種隨時可以搬移的屋子，就是我國西北部蒙古地方的帳幕。（圖六）他們住在沙漠地帶，靠着畜牧爲生，所以臨時找到有水草的地方，住屋必須隨處遷移，他們的住屋便和我們的住屋，就完全不同了。</p>
<h3>蛋的好壞</h3>
<p>— 沙永采</p>
<p>小朋友！你歡喜吃鷄蛋嗎？鷄蛋是一種含有極多「維他命」的東西，吃了的畢是很有益處。但是我們買的時候，必須要買新鮮的，因爲新鮮的才合衛生，但是我們拿什麽方法來判别呢？現在有一個極簡便的方法，就是當檢買鷄蛋的時候，我們可以備一碗淸水，將鷄蛋放在水中，若是新鮮的，它一定毫不猶　的沉在水底，假使是壞的或不新鮮的呢，那就浮在水面上了。這是什麽道理呢？說起來也很簡單，因爲鷄蛋裏的蛋黃蛋白這兩樣東西，他的重量，和水的重量，比較起來，是各不相同的。蛋黃的重量昌比水輕，而蛋白的重量却比水重，在新鮮的鷄蛋裏，蛋黃的分量比蛋白少，因爲蛋黃少而蛋白多，所以就沉在水底了。反轉來說：假使是不新鮮的和壞的，它的蛋黃的分量却比蛋白多。因爲蛋黃多經過了時日，就要漸漸長大，同時卽把蛋白漸漸的吸收了，蛋白减少，整個的鷄蛋的分量就變輕，所以浮在水面了。</p>
<h3>小笑話</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>一天，慧兒的爸爸，挈同了他上街去買洋襪，到了一家襪店内，呌夥計拿出了許多襪來揀。</p>
<p>一回兒，慧兒的爸爸，揀了一雙白色的問他道：『這雙洋襪你可歡喜嗎』？</p>
<p>慧兒聽見了他的爸爸這樣問他，同時，他瞧見了有幾雙黑色的，他想爸爸旣呌那白色的爲『羊襪』，那麽，像這些黑色的，當然可以呌做『牛襪』了。於是乎，他便指着黑色的洋襪，對他的爸爸道：『我不要那白色的『羊襪』，我要這黑色的『牛襪』！</p>
<h3>全世界的小朋友</h3>
<p>— 文譽揚</p>
<p>（一）阿刺伯那裏有很大的沙漠？我們算術學用的字就是他們發明的，那裏的朋友所穿的衣服，用一張很大的布，把頭和身體包紥着，只露着面孔的一小部分。他們無論到什麽地方去，常常騎著驢子。</p>
<p>（二）西藏在我國西南部份，那裏的小朋友頭上束着布，衣服是很零亂的，我們看來一定是覺得很難看，但是他們却成了習慣。他們讀書的時候很少，天天帮忙家裏做着苦工。</p>
<p>（三）朝鮮本來是我國的地方，後來給日本奪去了，那裏的小朋友，所穿的衣服。是我們中國的古裝，他們的鞋子也很特别。他們現在是亡國的人，天天過着奴隸的生活，讀的也是日文，而且大半小朋友沒有讀書啊！</p>
<p>（四）法蘭西的小孩子，他們的生活是很快樂的，有書讀，有遊戲，遊戲中最喜歡的，是和其他的小朋友們乘着小汽車比賽。</p>
<h3>露與霜</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>露的變成原理，因爲白天地上吸收了太陽的熱，到了夜間，這熱是要放散出來，熱與寒氣相觸，遂變爲露了。放散的熱，物理學上稱爲「熱的幅射」，可是白天所吸收的熱，到了半夜幅射時候，假使天晴，那露愈多，天若陰曇就不顯著的。譬如有雲的夜，即要阻止地上熱的幅射，妨碍露的成立，換句話來說；露的發生，實在是天氣中的水蒸氣，凝結於草木上或其他固體物上的水分。因爲天氣晴朗溫和的日子，河川池沼的水，時刻蒸發，所以大氣中，含有許多水蒸氣，到了夜間，地表與草木所吸收的熱，逐漸放射出來，這溫的熱氣，與冷的章木或地上相接觸，遂成爲水滴的露了。不過露點也因溫度而不同，如含有水蒸氣的空氣是熱，就宿而成爲露，如露點到了華氏三十二度以下，那就結露而爲霜，而且成露的原因，還有其他的條件，就是不可有風，如風過强，那含有水蒸氣的空氣，都被風所吹散。露與草木的生長關係很大，當夏季無雨的時期，草木受露的潤澤，不會枯死。上面所說，露因溫度低降，即變爲霜，因爲物體的溫度，降到冰點以下，其附近的空氣，也同時冷却，物理學上所謂「飽和」假使空氣很　，附近空氣雖降至冰點以下，如過飽和時，那就變爲固體，這就是成霜的理由。在我國的氣候塞外比關内爲寒，江浙一帶，大抵到了九十兩月，就要落霜，過了翌年三月，才沒有霜，照節氣上說起來，有「白露」節，是露水　降的意思，「寒露」節是天氣陰寒愈甚的意思，「霜降」是露給爲霜的意思，「雨水是天氣漸暖，冰雪化爲雨水的意思，大槪過了霜降節以後，天晴夜寒，那霜凝結得愈白，若溫度降至攝氏零下，水即凝凍爲冰，我們當寒天的淸晨，常看見由瓦　　的露水，凝結爲冰柱，就是露水的溫度已降至冰點以下的緣故。</p>

<p>本週棉市狀况、較爲活動、同業與經紀商稍稍買進、價乃徐漲、一般商業前途有美滿景象、而出口需求亦有加增之望、此亦爲棉價稍起之原因、加以華盛頓有與德俄兩國談判買棉市消息、人氣乃愈堅、價旣漲起、現棉售出稍多、但南方套賣、在比較上依然寥寥、期貨購者並不猛進、以爲市價再漲、則目前指恃政府借欵而國積之棉、定可有若干售出、而同業需求、亦將以其所亟需者爲限也、再早期交割之新棉、現正貶値售出、蓋料明年棉產或將增多、而價格將更鬆動也、據華盛頓訊、棉農合作社所有及因抵借政府債欵而儲積之棉、共約五百萬包、</p>

<h3>期粉暴漲四分餘</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、　上午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼振之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回小二四角左右、坎拿大小四八分左右、當開價時、因洋麥報價、本月份開價、曾一度小落、低至四角四分、惟過此軟檔、市氣均呈步步挺貴之勢、本月份因實銷方面、南洋帮續見活動、北帮亦有抽買、至各廠方面、聞因原料不豐、一部分將須减車、是以買氣特盛、市况俏利異常　、較初開時、計近期反漌四分、遠期好二分外、迨至下午開盤、近期人心、依然良好、以實銷甚活、兼之廠家亦稍收回、致愈抽愈緊、收價衝至五角大關、照原料之不豐而言、近期恐少回短之望也、結果本月份暴漲四分二厘半、一月份漲四分七厘半、二三月份漲三分二厘半、四月份漲二分七厘半、五月份初開五角八分、收價亦漲一分七厘半云、</p>
<h3>小麥亦跟粉價轉高</h3>
<p>昨日麥市上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平穩之局、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小二四角不等、坎拿大小四八分左右、開價時、洋麥雖見小面、惟以市場之抛户淸淡、市趨平穩、遠期亦因出户甚少、大致呈穩固之局、迨至下午開盤、以粉市之轉昂、兼之稅率之謠傳未息、買氣轉活、市氣亦步良好、以本埠各廠小麥之需要而言、此後必須續定洋麥、方有救濟、但進口稅太巨、致廠家觀望不前也、結果本月份較漲三分、一月份漲五分、二月份漲五分、三月份漲七分、現麥市面、以紛銷已活、各檔喊價續好三四分、開山東　德麥三元九角四五分、正陽關麥三元九角三分、海州徐州明光麥三元九角、瑶灣麥三元九角四分、由福新去八千包、申大去三千包云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥市面似在盤旋中、目下價格挺進時引志抛出、廠家現購進、市場上之投機者則多空頭、因國内降甘霖及國外市揚軟弱而跌、</p>

<h3>河下米略見下游</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源稍夥、共到四十餘號、貨共六千餘石、晨初市面尙佳、因銀根關係軟化、加之到多銷淡、本街進胃萎疲、祇賴包胃、僅靑島帮辦百餘包、形勢反覺帶軟、各晚稻及厚粳價亦已跌落數分、杜洋尖及陰變元等各花色價亦相仿、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下内地各路城鎭到貨二十四五艘、市上各色去胃、白粳包胃、上棧略動、本街交易尙佳、早薄稻及各尖仍平淡、新陳白元陰元零拆路交易、酒户揀廉者續進、市形白粳早市帶疲、午市轉定、羊尖杜尖　稻新陳白元陰元價格又跌一角左右、早稻客尖定勢、埠尖高料挺立、中次貨小一二角、</p>

<h3>刑法通姦條修正以後？</h3>
<p>— 二九</p>
<p>新刑法通姦罪只處罰有夫之婦與人通姦，而不處罰有婦之夫與人通姦一事，轟轟烈烈地閙了多時，到前日立法院修正爲「有配偶而與人通姦者處一年以下有期徒刑，其相姦者亦同　而後，算吿了一個大結束。在這條法律上，我們再找不到男女不平等的痕跡。</p>
<p>然而與我們婦女切膚的關係，是事實而不是法律；解除婦女苦痛的關鍵，是經濟而不是空文。民國以來男女在法律上完全平等的規定，不是始於今日；然而婦女之爲牛爲馬，依然如故。</p>
<p>中華民族，素來喜歡單講表面：往者宋眞宗時只要遼人肯稱我們爲兄，便暗地每年送他銀十萬兩，絹二十萬疋也很願意。這醜惡的弱點至今仍未能除却，婦女的心理中，當然也是具有的。所以這次通姦條修正以後，許有人以爲男女已經平等，而覺得非常榮幸；那就眞是蠢人了！</p>
<p>婦女沒有獨立生活的知識，沒有獨立生活的機會（職業），單只靠她的性工具以爲衣，以爲食，以爲養老慈幼，她如何去承受法律的保障？以現在社會狀况日趨混亂而論，有婦之夫的需要他人妻女以滿足淫慾的男人，不見得會比有夫之婦的需要他人的男子以接濟衣食的女人多多少。那麽這條通姦的法律卽使能平等地執行，大批情有可原的與人通姦的有夫之婦，和事實難恕的荒淫無度的男子，受同樣的處罰，已經是寃枉千萬了。而况女子依男子以爲生的今日，有幾個能吿發她的丈夫的姦情呢？</p>
<p>男女在思想上習慣上不平等，敎育也自然不能平等，職業也更不能平等。中人之家，寗可送愚笨的兒子讀大學，而不願送聰慧的女兒讀中學，這是普遍的事實。各種機關，寗可用膚淺狂妄的男子，而不肯篤實誠愼的女人，這也是普遍的事實。各種工廠，女工生產無論能力如何，工資總不及男子的一半，這又是很明顯的事實。這些事實不解决，平等的法律，對於女子只是一種口惠而已。</p>
<p>我們謹提出刑法通姦條修正以後又將如何？的問題，願聞欲提高婦女地位的有心人的高論！</p>
<h3>寫在刑法「二三九」條修改以後</h3>
<p>— 郭箴一</p>
<p>新刑法二三九條，曾經婦女界的激烈反對後，現已由立法院復議：恢復原修正案：『有配偶而與人通姦者處一年以下有期徒刑，其相姦者亦同一。這一次婦女爭法運動，得如此下塲，總算差强人意。然而還有比這條更重要的法律，仍須我們繼續掙扎而要求删改。</p>
<p>如果因經濟的發展與由此而來的男女社交公開，結婚與離婚自由，兩性關係完全建立在同居之必須及有意識的意志做了維持的基礎，根本用不着法律，假使要法律來約束夫婦間的關係，那嗎夫妻間的情感早已消逝了。</p>
<p>不過女子在現時所處的環境中，男子挾其經濟上及社會上之優越地位及數千年之風俗習慣，男子通姦不算什麽，女子則爲大逆不道。雖明知此條法律於事實無大裨益，然而女子至少獲得了法律上明文規定的通姦罪平等處罰。設若不是在這個畸形社會裏，爲解除婦女一層壓迫，當然澈底廢除這條法律，未嘗不更妥善。</p>
<p>現在二三九條，已進吿一段落，但對二二一條，似乎已無人顧問了，按「二二一條」誘姦十四歲以下之少女始獲罪一條，受害者多半是大都會中產以下之户口，我們該更注重，爲保全未成年的柔弱少女，非請改爲十六歲之原文不可。</p>
<p>此外民法一千一百二十三條第三欵：「雖非親屬，而以永久共同生活爲目的同居一家者，視爲家屬。」民法因無妾的地位，這條是承認妾的存在，我們也應當反對的。</p>
<p>更重要者，婦女勞動法急需要求改善：使貧苦婦女從事職業，不再片面的爲僱主所犧牲。所以應請政府制定勞動法，如產前產後休假日數，工資提高（普通多低於男工）以及夜工之廢止或縮短時間等，均應明白規定而切實執行。</p>
<p>本着總理遺敎及民國約法，婦女在法律上的平等，是用不着再是動而要求的。這次運動的結果，要再求圓滿的話，最低限度必需達到删修改善以上這幾項刑法，民法，及婦女勞動法的目的。</p>
<h3>受過敎育的婦女到那裏去了？</h3>
<p>— 關露</p>
<p>反封建制度的婦女解放運動，到現在已經是提倡了不少的年代了。一般的說起來，這種運動是獲得了相當的效果的：「父母之命，媒妁之言」的婚姻打破了，「男女授受不親」「女子無才便是德」的敎條撕毁了。從前不出閏門，不習文字的深閨婦女，現在是提了書包上學校了。從幼孩時代直到成年，到結婚，是有不少的婦女接觸過大學的光陰的。在學校敎職員休息室裏，醫院裏，銀行公司裏，以及其他一切的商店和機關裏，已是有着不少的女服務者的足跡。</p>
<p>當然我們現在所談的婦女問題，只是就這些受過敎育的知識婦女，並不包括廣大的連小學敎育都受不起的體力勞動婦女，因爲那問題太大了。</p>
<p>現在就知識婦女說罷，是不是由上面所舉的那些現象，我們就可以得着解答：婦女解放運動得着成績了，婦女被解放了，女性和男性平等了？</p>
<p>這種解答，恐怕使一個現有着高等職業的婦女，如果她是覺悟的話，她是不會這樣去相信的。我們試看一看許許多多的知識婦女的出路　。</p>
<p>知識婦女來說，　　受　　中以下的敎　的婦女以外，單就受過大學敎育的婦女看，平均在每個大學裏的女生人數幾乎佔全數百分之十，這百分之十的女生人數，若拿去和男的比較，當然是蕭條得可憐，但是只就這每個學校平均的數目的　數，和各機關裏的職業婦女人數去比較，昌怎麽樣的差别；而且，職業婦女的數目是有限的，學校是每年送出一批舊生，招進一批新生，當然知職婦女的人數，不能只就在學的而言，那麽受了敎育的婦女，除開分配了潦潦的幾個在各學校各機關裏服務外，那大批　數目銷到那裏去了？從幼童時代到成年，到結婚爲止，在結束了四年丨丨或不滿四年丨丨大學光陰以後的婦女，她們把曾經是「十年窗下」的功課用到什麽地方去了，把實騐室和圖書館裏的收獲又給了誰了？不成問題的是這　婦女解放運的結果，把大批受着「愚民」敎育的深閨婦女，從柴米油鹽醬醋茶的家庭中解放了出來，完結了幾年的男女平等的敎育後，重新又把她們送回到老家去，做一個新型式的「賢妻良母」！</p>
<p>當然，「賢妻良母」主義的女性，不是婦女們自已所願意當的，不是婦女們自已不願意去尋職業，去參加社會活動，寗願做一個依人爲生的家庭婦女，而被人看作是一個鑑賞物和獨佔的「賣淫婦」，而是在這種婦女的生活形式中，使婦女們不能解放家庭生活的束縛，不能免去爲妻爲母的特殊任務，不能不由於這種特殊任務不發生對於社會活動的障礙。可以說，中國當前的婦女問題，不只是失業的恐慌，而是即使是有了職業怎麽樣去服務！</p>
<p>在這裏我們不能不想到的一個問題，就是對於婦女問題最有關係的家庭問題，是使婦女問題難以解决的問題，也就是那不止是家庭而是整個的社會制度的問題了。在一種不能使婦女經濟獨立，和不能使婦女成爲職業婦女與社會婦女的制度下，偶然在幾個最少數的婦女有了職業丨丨那些大多數無職業的並非是眞正不做事白受人供養，實在是操了另一種職業：即當奴隷和向特定的人賣身丨丨這種徼倖的職業，並不是靠着她們的知識，和她們的能力；不是每一個知識婦女都可以得到的，不能够永遠維持到明天的。「賢妻良母」是她們歸宿的總路綫，是她們活動與生動的總範圍；除開她是永遠抱着獨身主義，不要有過結婚的試騐，並且要永遠少年，永遠吸人，永遠能鬨人的調笑。</p>
<p>我們對於過去婦女運動的結論，就只用受過最高敎育的婦女來說：那種婦女運動，對於婦女是不曾解放的，加給婦女的許多封建壓迫是不曾解除的。在這麽多年婦女解放運動下的知識婦女，她們所有的東西，是除開了封建制度的壓迫外，還加上了資本主義國家輸進來的放大的耳圈，和翻譯出來的新蹂躪的契約；兩樣東西加起來的總數：便是西式的「摩登」和東方的「閑靜」。這就是人造的知識婦女曲型。</p>
<p>最後我們要明白的，我們知識婦女的任務，並不是用了幽默的文章和俏皮的語言去笑駡自已和别人，我們的任務是要反抗替這些婦女們造典型的主宰和制度，要反抗這種婦女的典型生活；要在社會裏尋找出那些失了踪跡的曾是受過敎育的知識婦女，替那些無知識的婦女造知識，替一切未解放的婦女求解放！</p>
<h3>麵包與咖啡</h3>
<p>— 子衿</p>
<p>詩人××，一天興高采烈地在他的朋友×××的家裏，大談共娶了妻子，有了孩子的中年時代的戀愛觀。他說「他結婚後！戀愛事件，约莫有了一百餘。中學生，大學生，美的，醜的，大的，小的，年高的，年靑的愛人都有。失戀也快有一百次，但他一點也不悲傷，一點也不介意。因爲中年人有了妻子，再去戀愛，就等於喝「咖啡。」閒了喝幾杯「咖啡，」當然多喝一點也好，不喝亦可。拿到了手裏，被人搶去，也不必傷心痛哭。反正這是消閑的「咖啡，」······。夫人可就不同，夫人等於「麵包，」這維持生命的「麵包，」可不能缺少。所以做夫人的假使明瞭了這一點，儘可以讓他的男人出去玩玩，喝幾杯「咖啡，」潤潤喉，點綴點綴生活。」</p>
<p>詩人說畢，嘴角邊漾出綠綠玩世的微笑。滿屋子的人，都爲他這高明的見解，讚嘆不已，大笑不止。</p>
<p>這詩人所代表的現時代的一般玩世的中年男子，這時全好像赤裸裸地站立在陽光之下。他們家中放着一個安分的妻子，給他們當會計，裁縫，廚子，買辦，保姆，婢僕，發　性慾的機　。一切替他們安排得舒服。她們的丈夫，認爲這是家常「飯食，」這是「麵包。」僅這「麵包，」他們不能滿足。空閒了要出去玩玩，吸點新鮮空氣，喝杯「咖啡。手臂上持着個活的Ｓtick。於是就有那些年靑的女學生，意志薄弱的女人，被他們引誘，被他們安置到「咖啡」杯裏。暫時可以解他們的口渴，醫他們的孤寂，治他們一時的狂病。</p>
<p>淸山之顚，綠水之濱，熱鬧的遊藝塲，幽靜的公園，北平，南京，上海，杭州，漢口，天津，······一切大都市，大名勝，風景區，常常可以看到一些西裝的體面紳士，手臂上掛着個「活的Ｓtick，」這就是他們消閑「咖啡」。</p>
<p>活的Ｓtick，消閑的咖啡丨緊貼在你們身旁的活魔，實在就是蛇蝎，就是撲殺你們靈性，毁滅你們幸福的猛獸！</p>
<p>可是社會只有毁壞你們，不能帮助你們。專利一方的法律，也不能保護你們！尤其是寬容大量的新近修改的法津，准許十四歲的少女，也有資格被安置到消閑的咖啡杯裏了。這一定爲××詩人那樣的中年男子所笑逐顏開，恭而敬之地接受的。姊妹們，甚麽都不能靠别人，掃除你們的依賴性像一堆塵土。趕快地自已覺悟，自已猛醒，站直來做一個人！</p>

<h3>桂林特别區妓院街寫眞</h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>雖說是一區，但所佔的地盤並不大，至於妓院街，那就只有三五排房子的衖堂模樣大小。在這手掌大一塊天地之間，高下貴賤的階級，可說分得非常嚴密。頭兩排一前一後約有十來家牆壁扮得白白的土庫房子，是一等娼寮。這種房子有一樓一底兩層，是一廂房一客堂式客堂向後退出七八尺見方的地盤，凑成一個内天井。這些娼寮一般統名曰廬，客娼寮又冠以各自特别的名稱，例如金廬，玉廬，來鳳廬，黃鶴廬等。就像有祖傳似的，各廬客堂内靠着上方的壁頭，都擺有一個長長的香几，不拘香几上零亂汚濁到若何程度，香几正中央總有一個資格很老的香爐，爐内挿着不少的香籤棍丨丨這是鴇母妓女們敬過財神的遺痕。不知是中國人不良習慣的展露，抑或是妓院的風俗，這一等娼寮的客堂内，無論那一家都是橫七豎八擺上兩三張不成樣的床舖，而且時常擁擠滿了不成樣的男男女女，就像上海的薦頭行丨丨當然那是鴇母　頭以及在妓女身上括飯喫的一些有瓜葛關係的人們丨丨與陳設華麗的妓女房間（廂房内）合成一個絕妙的對照，而也就說明了妓女房間内的美好陳設與她們身上的麗都服裝，全不是爲了生活的享受，只不過爲的做生意。</p>
<p>這一等娼寮的妓女們，服裝都很入時，平日也是旗袍皮鞋。她們白晝無事，姊妹們三三兩兩佇立在妓院門外，望着近在咫尺的甲天下名勝象鼻山和明鏡般的漓江水出神，一面兼用暗示方法招徠生意，以及有時乘着脚踏車在江邊兜兜圈子外，人們不容易多見她們，尤其在晚上，她們好似特别保持她們的高等身價，决不在門外閒站，只打扮得如花似玉在自家「廬」内等待出堂差和歡迎高貴的嫖客。</p>
<p>在一等娼寮後面，便是兩排面對面的木板平房，這是二等娼寮。這些平房本身很平凡，室外全是刷的靑一色的土紅色，可是室内的佈置，就頗出奇。好好一間不能算大的房，由中間用木板向後隔出一個小房，旁邊又空出一條窄窄的走路，而且這木板在離地四五尺高，前面正對着大門，後面正對着小房的床舖地方，挖有約摸三尺寛兩尺高的一個洞，洞内嵌上一塊透明的玻璃。沒有客人（嫖客）時，該房内妓女的床帳舖蓋，過路人可以看得淸淸楚楚，有客時，玻璃上便蒙有一塊花布。在小房外好像是客堂的那一方空間内，也如一等娼寮的客堂一樣，橫七豎八擺有一兩張不成樣的床舖，日夜都有鴇母之類的人坐在上面，彷彿在做監督工夫。</p>
<p>這二等娼寮的妓女們，大半是着短衣長褲，小半是穿旗袍，而且旗袍也不十分入時。她們時常站在門口，但大多數却同坐在門闞内的一張小凳上，將頭斜斜依着門，宛如雀巢内待哺的乳燕似的將一對熱望的眼一貶不貶地注視門外，期待着來客。也就在這兩排平房的盡頭，在一　　光　則發亮的門外，掛有一塊黑底白字的招牌，上面寫着「××花捐微收處」有。</p>
<p>在一等娼寮後面，又是一連二十餘間在建築上更爲鳌脚的木板平房，外面也全是刷的土紅色，但除了那日夜虚掩或緊閉着的出入口丨丨門以外，沒有看見一個窗，這就是三等娼寮。以全體妓院街而言，這三等娼寮門前的道路特别寛，妓女們就像上海四馬路和北京路的晚景一樣，全是親自站在路上拉客。這些三等妓女們的年齡好像極不劃一，其中有些三十以上的，也有些看去只十三四歲。她們的裝束全是短衣長褲，而且幾乎都是布的，那樣子，與上海灘上初上街給人帮傭的大姐差不了多少。</p>
<p>「居移氣，養　體」，看看桂林特區這一二三等妓女們所住的房屋與所呼吸的空氣，她們的生活，我們可以想見了。</p>
<h3>潮洲的婦女生活</h3>
<p>— 彭毓炯</p>
<p>爲着想要觀光一下這農村破產的眞實面目，所以今年毅然决然的！離開了上海，而特地跑到這遠隔城市的鄕村來，過着敎書的生涯：但，每當到了禮拜日，或是休假期間，我們便照例的要約些同志，從城市跑到鄕間，遠近的去調查各處的婦女生活實况，我認爲這是必要的！</p>
<p>在目前，中國婦女的解放問題，不但沒有得到澈底的解决，而多數婦女，還是依舊過着從來的牛馬生涯！我們假若只要離開這大都市，而走到任何一個鄕村去看，那種婦女一般的生活狀况，　實在使我們感到中國婦女生活，確是「刻不容緩」的急待解决呢！雖然，這個問題，丨丨丨要求大多數勞働婦女解放的這問題，是隨着整個社會問題的解决才得有解决的可能的。</p>
<p>潮洲，是廣東東部一個極大的區域，屬於東江的九縣；那裏一般的婦女生活，痛苦的更是令我們不忍目睹！</p>
<p>第一，潮洲婦女的婚姻，是絕對沒有自主權的。女的，除了憑媒妁之言，父母之命而被訂婚；結婚之後，不但要討丈夫的喜悅，還要極端的奉承公婆，而借此得到公婆的歡心之後，才能在那一個家庭裏面站得住脚呢！不然的話，就是丈夫一人歡喜你，但得不到公婆的歡心，而你也沒法子在那家庭生存得下去！最近潮陽地方發生一件案子就是：因爲該女結婚後，得不到公婆的歡心，居然驅使他的兒子，將他的妻子亂刀殺死，先將乳部割去······的悲慘事件！</p>
<p>第二，潮洲的婦女智識，一般尙很低淺；雖然，在城市，鄕村，都有一些女子學校的設立，但，能得入校的實在佔少數！因爲從來的封建思想的束縛，家長的不同意，使潮洲的婦女，因此沒有法子受到相當的敎育！而一女子無才便是德的呼聲，更高唱在她們每一個家長的口中。</p>
<p>第三，因爲潮洲地方偏僻沒有廣大熱鬧的交際塲，而一般有閒階級的婦女，往往感到精神空虚，而沒有一個正當的寄托的所在，她們便跑向禮拜堂去，借以發洩她們苦悶無聊的空虚的精神，一切都希求建造在來年！所以，潮洲的一般婦女，她們的生活，都宗敎化了，迷信化了！整日裏，她們都在家裏唸着經，做着禱吿。逢禮拜日，她們就裝飾起來，跑到禮拜堂去。反之，一般勞苦無依的婦女，她們正朝朝暮暮，裸着身子，（因爲氣候的關係）在碼頭上，挑着泥土；在街市上，担着販賣零星的担子，沿街呌喚。</p>
<p>末了，隨着整個制度的破滅，而潮洲一切社會現象當然不能例外。年來的潮洲婦女，受着雙層勢力的壓迫，生活得痛苦的程度，愈加尖銳，愈見惡劣！在這樣情形底下，中國婦女解放的前途，要何時才能放出一綫曙光呢？同樣的，被沉淪在這地嶽裏面生活的，是無數個婦女呢！</p>

<p>三年不到湖濱路，心裹怪空空的。今年蟹肥菊艷的時候，避着百忙的覊絆，悄悄地到了那個夢裏的舊地。爲要先得湖山的歡心，不曾通知一個故人。趕着夕陽還在山巔，放船蕩到湖心；三潭印月的袁柳，依依輕舞，表示仍然相識。從杏花村沿裏湖歸來，已是披星戴月時分；萬籟無聲，點點燈光，陪伴一湖明月。忽然林蔭深處，傳來朗誦之聲，覺得有些耳熟，便信步走了近去，則聽那人正在讀朱淑貞的秋夜詩：</p>
<p>夜久無眠秋氣淸，燭花頻剪欲三更，鋪牀凉滿梧桐月，月在梧桐缺處明。</p>
<p>這分明熟習的聲音，已凄凄地充了我一個滿懷：然而她的名字，却被衝散在胸懷之外。沒動靜地過了一會，那淺紅的紗窗裏，映出一個低低的大大的頭來，頓時喚醒了我的記憶；我不等她將『無家枉說曾招婿，有影終年只傍親』的詩　完，便直去敲她的前門。裏面一隻狗「汪汪汪汪地吠着，樓上臨窗而立的笛蓀，知　不理。我知這不是深夜呌門的辦法，便大聲　出她我的名來。她『啊！』了一聲就已跑到樓下，雙手握住我在階下開始哭泣。</p>
<p>三年來我們消息斷絕，這在漂泊的人是常有的事，而不料笛蓀的音容，竟像隔了幾　·以前她是黑而肥的，現在是黃而瘦了·惟有那個不曾减的矮矮的身材，依稀還是前時的人·我找不出最適當的話來，在她陳設嶄新的房裏，沉默了好一會，才問她道：『笛蓀！你怎麽的？』</p>
<p>『我嫁了！』她用哭聲回答。我知道許多姊妹最傷心的事莫過於婚姻問題，這種事最好避開不提，不然，反而使她痛定思痛。然而笛蓀她不肯緘默；她凄咽了一會，開始說道：</p>
<p>『白石！人生如夢，結婚才是夢裏的惡夢呢！不過夢醒來一切可以復原，而我們却是萬刦不可復返了！全然破滅了！正像彗星碰着行星，兩都粉碎了！······其實是只有一年，一年短短的歲月啊！一年以前，他雖然是那麽瘦長，却並不掛着招牌『薄倖』；我雖然那麽肥短，却並不是沒有靈魂的肉屍。然而現在，我們都完了！我一看見他常常想起他那雙又瘦又黑的手手是不乾凈，不乾淨；他看見我時當然想的更壞，更兇，因爲他是有十倍地厭我啊！你知道：我三十多歲不曾浪漫，爲的甚麽？我並不曾夢想朝秦暮楚地過活，而他，却把我當作比神女生涯的人更不値錢，更不像樣，更不配和他同居，我怎麽受得了呢？』</p>
<p>她的浸沉於凄咽傷感，使我想起了許多往事。四年前她的摯友少蘭出閣，她整整有一月工夫沒有開過笑顏。終日倒在枕上，很少見天日。這樣一個多情多恨的人物，當然是經不起失戀的。往常曾和她開過玩笑：她若結婚，必得選一個和她的性格相近的人。於是我忽然得了一句恰當的話問她，藉以打斷她的哀思。</p>
<p>『誰給你介紹的？是一個甚麽人？』</p>
<p>『人是你知道的，也沒有誰介紹，他自已來找我。』</p>
<p>『倒底是誰呢？』我又問她。</p>
<p>『李漁！』她拖着沉痛的尾聲。</p>
<p>『李漁！』我腦子裏反覆了一遍，登時便浮現了一個蒼白的瘦長的少年的姿態。天！這是怎樣一回錯誤！這一個冷漠的憔悴的少年，拿甚麽去承受笛蓀的火一般的熱，絲一般的柔的深情？</p>
<p>『他來看過我兩次病。』笛蓀從頭說起他們的經過。『後來便託人來問我是不是抱獨身主義，我回說沒有這回事。過了一禮拜，他來邀我游湖；在船上他突然問我：假如我們合作的話，有沒有甚麽問題。這話若是由一個别人半呑半吐地對我說，我一定要轉輾尋思，三五日也不能答覆。然而是他，平素不多開口的人，他這一問我只當他早已審察過了：我的年紀大，我的容貌不美，我的情感很痴，······所有這些，我們同事了四五年，他該熟習了的。他旣然沒有甚麽問題，我當然想不出大的不可；雖然經濟有些可慮，然而我母親還有幾個積蓄，所以我當時找不出拒絕的理由。不久春假來到，我回家去接母親，共同來學辦這一件事：臨走前將一份快到期的錢莊的存摺，託他代取。我和母親到杭時，離結婚的日期只有三天；三天是很容易過的，到那日吃酒的客人剛散，他問我怎樣開支賬目，我茫然不知所答。除了那一份存摺以外，我和母親再沒有這許多活動現欵。幸而一切還是他出去照料，不多久他已淸閒地回房。房裏的陳設，從生花到地板，沒有一處不現出暖和而紅艷；然而當我迎接他時，他的臉就和銀元一樣白，一樣冷。我抱着這個冷爐住了三天，時時打着冷顫。三天過後，他蹬起脚往學校去了，從此我們就完全生疏；不僅是生疏，還在毫無成見的生疎以上。直到現在一年多，我只有夢裏見他時還有些快樂。我也明知結婚常有破裂的時候，然而像我這樣快却是夢想不到的。苦苦辛辛種了一回花，不說不開花，葉子都不曾抽一片，到底做的甚麽呢？······我現在身體已經這樣了，也不願說些甚麽；只是：他爲麽要和我結婚這一問題，我要一直疑問到黃泉去。······』說到這裏，她又掩面了。</p>
<p>我竭力勸慰她，拉她到窗前望月，拉她到院子裏散步，等她好了一些，才又别去。跟着我來的船大姐，已經在門口睡着。我大聲呌醒了她，一隻林鳥受了驚飛向湖心而去。不知怎的我忽然覺得牠便是李漁的影子，牠飛到水裏吃魚，牠飛到山中吃果，有着絕大的自由；魚和果雖能招了來，却不能留了牠住。笛蓀的悲劇或許就在這裏：現在還有生活的路爲男子開着，小小的斤兩是絆不住他們的脚跟的。</p>
<p>湖上飄着輕輕的白霧，柳絲掃動着水底的沉月；在這夢一般的故地，第一個逢着夢一般的故人。</p>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>職業的活動與人生觀</h3>
<p>— 雉羽</p>
<p>如果說每一個人都有他的人生觀，大家就會感覺到這話未免有點誇大罷？因爲人生觀是指着對於人生的究竟之哲學的思想體系或槪念而言，大多數人何嘗理解什麽哲學，我們說每一個人都有他的人生觀，這不是誇大是什麽？而且，把人生觀弄得太多樣性了，也是很不科學的。因爲假使每一個人都有一種人生觀，這不是把作爲社會思想而體現出來的人生觀，弄得極端混亂了嗎？還說得上它是一種社會思想體系嗎？</p>
<p>其實，事實的確是如此，不但每個個人都有一種人生觀，而且也並不因此就妨礙社會思想體系的人生觀之成立。因爲個人的人生觀雖在社會中表現得數量無限，但社會中是有着許多地位環境大略相同的多數人組合的各種羣，所以這一定的社會羣就有其共同的人生觀。而且就每個歷史的一定時代說，亦有那一時代特定的人生觀，以别於他一時代的人生觀，這是社會科學家已經證明了的事實。個人的人生觀之多樣性，其所以並不妨礙作爲社會思想體系而體現的人生觀之成立，乃是因爲個人的人生觀有小異於一定的羣和一定的社會之社會的人生觀，但亦有其大同於一定的羣和一定的社會之社會的人生觀的緣故。一定的羣和一定的社會的人生觀，是從個人的人生觀中抽繹出來形成的總的體系，所以個人的人生觀中包含着社會的人生觀，社會的人生觀中也包含着個人的人生觀。這就論理學上說來，則是「一般」包含於「個别」之中，「個别」也包含於「一般」之中的論理法則。</p>
<p>爲什麽人類的人生觀會有如此複雜的多樣性呢？它的根本關鍵的所在，乃是由於人類的一切觀念形態並非天賦的，個人，社會羣，社會都有其特定的生活環境，一定的生活狀態，以及個人和社會羣之一定的社會地位等等，這就影響或者直接說產生他的思想，形成他的人生觀。人生觀是人類的社會地位與生活狀態之觀念的表白，它建立在實際的生活基礎上的。</p>
<p>我們明白了上述的理由，便很容易理解和說明職業活動與人生觀的關聯性了。一定職業的勞働者，因爲他的職業活動的生活狀態，因爲他的經濟生活狀態乃至社會地位不同，遂由實際的事實反映，决定着他的人生觀甚至宇宙觀。在遠古的人類歷史上，已經充分地表現過這種事實和現象。漁獵時代的人，他們因爲終日從事獵取動物的職業活動，所以在他們的石洞裏，壁間，繪畫着各種動物，從那些藝術上表現他們的人生觀和宇宙觀，認爲動物是唯一値得注意的，甚至崇拜動物，以動物爲神聖。在農業的居民，是不知世界和社會的廣大及其一切的，他們的思想只注意到年歲的豐欠，注意到田禾的生長與成熟，他們所認識的人生幸福與痛苦，就只在於收穫的美滿或荒歉。他們的職業上是依靠着自然的節令，天時，風雨，日光等等，所以他們不但迷信着風伯，雨師，日月星辰等神，而且把他們的命運都寄託在這些自然物上面，搆成一種聽天安命的人生觀。</p>
<p>在近代社會裏，就工人來說，他們在城市和工廠裏工作，一切天時的變化是與他們無關的，因而沒有農民的那種人生觀和宇宙觀。而且他們還以自已的力量駕馭着機器，利用偉大的電力，蒸氣力，火力，水力等等，所以他們便知道自然不是神秘的，而人力是偉大的，這就形成了他們的特殊的人生觀。此外如那些從事商業活動的人，其人生觀是以市塲，價値，賺錢失本爲中心；智識勞働者則對於知識，學問，宇宙和人生根源之哲學的探求與獲得，視爲人生最高尚和最有興味的事體，而商人，工業家等則常視知識勞働者爲不足道。所有這些，都充分地表明着個人和各種社會羣，由於他的職業活動範圍的不同，就有不同的人生觀。</p>

<h3>南洋書商</h3>
<p>— 海秋</p>
<p>說一說南洋書業的情形，是一件很有趣味的事。一般的說來，南洋在文化上是比較落後的，華僑的文化事業雖有相當的發展，但較之中國本土大城市的文化水準却仍是望塵莫及。這一點，從南洋的書業情形裏反映了出來。</p>
<p>南洋的書大半是從上海批發去的。什麽樣的書在南洋最有銷路的呢？丨丨這或者是諸位讀者所要問的。我們知道，南洋各地能够升大學的靑年學子多半要跑回本國來，在廣州，厦門，上海等地的大學裏找他們的智識；大學程度的書的需要不用說幾乎是等於零。中等程度的書雖較有銷路，但究因買主有限，又要受當地官廳的種種限制，自然也談不到多大的買賣。最需要，銷路最好的是一種娛樂性的舊小說，看圖增加興趣的連環圖畫和其他的圖畫書，以及指導日常生活的「日用便覽」「萬事不求人」「珠算指授大全」等的通俗智識書。至外，四書五經和迷信的符咒書之類也有着不少的需要。這些書多半都是石印的，線裝的。</p>
<p>上海有一種書店專門作内地和南洋各埠的批發生意。我曾因了一個偶然的機會，到這種書店去參觀過一次，也曾看見過南洋的書商們向他們批發的書籍的目錄。一間長的廂房，一間客堂，四壁的書架上都滿滿的堆着各色各樣大小不同的綫裝石印書籍，是這個書店所給予我的最深的印象。南洋的書商們稱這種綫裝書爲「舊書」，把「各科常識問答」，「各科投考指南」，「××基礎」，「××百日通」·········之類的洋裝鉛印的投機書稱爲「新書」，那些與新文化有關係的書籍，自然也是在「新書」之列了。</p>
<p>這些「舊書」價錢大都是很便宜的。有三五分錢一部的，有三五角錢一部的，很少有每部超過一元的。書店批發給他們，大半是折實後再打八折。</p>
<p>不要看這些書不値錢，買得多了，一筆生意却也不在少數。批發書價，數百元是小數目，千把幾百元也並不算多。書商們對於有銷路的書，如日用的通俗書，舊小說中的「封神演義」，「列國演義」，「三國演義」，「西遊記」，「水滸傳」，「紅樓夢」，「七俠五義」，「濟公傳」，「鏡花緣」······等，起碼要批發一百部到兩百部，其他銷路次些的書也視其需要的多寡而批發五十部，三十部，十部，五部不等。這些書的名目多到不可勝計，這裏恕我不一一列舉了。</p>
<p>南洋書商們不僅是在上海批發書籍，也在上海批發筆墨。南洋各埠大都愛銷老牌貨物的，筆墨以胡開文，周虎臣等商號的出品爲佳；但老牌貨物價錢大都昻貴，如一枝鷄狼毫或小楷羊毫筆，在上海非一角五到兩角大洋莫辦，可是南洋的顧客却不願出這數目購買的。若照這數目批發了，則不但到南洋沒有銷路，就是銷掉了，貼了水脚，恐怕還不够本呢。於是，有些書商想出了一條錦嚢妙計，他們偷偷地和上海的筆作坊裏的老板約好，把每枝値價一分，二分，三分，四分，五分，六分等的筆，冒大筆店的招牌，刻上一些「大京水」，「金不換」，「凈純羊毫」，「小楷羊毫」，「鷄狼毫」······等等的字樣，以適應南洋買主的需要。他們出的本錢輕，到南洋自然是很可以獲利的。</p>
<p>他們也運銷自來水筆的，但大都是野鷄牌子，質料次些的大致每打値價十五元，較好的約二十二元。他們購買這些貨物，大都有書店跑街向他們介紹，跑街則從貨價中抽取百分之幾的佣金，以作酬勞。</p>
<p>書商向上海辦貨，有親自來的，有在上海僱用「坐莊客」的，有僅用通信手續直接和書店筆店辦貨的。南洋書商多是長江流域一帶的人，他們回家時自然也可以順道在上海辦這種事情。</p>
<p>書價不一定要用現欵全部繳淸，大都是採用「押匯」辦法。比如一千元的生意，現欵交二三百元就可以了，俟書筆到達南洋時，再將餘欵向郵局交淸卽可。老主顧不用說又是可以「掛帳」的。</p>
<p>書商在南洋營業情形是這樣的：有本錢的開大的或較小的書店，做門市生意；本錢小的則在馬路邊擺攤子，一如上海馬路旁的書販，也有將書打個包袱從這裏賣到那裏的。</p>
<p>在南洋經營書業，早年頗能獲利。這不但是批發得便宜，賣得貴的緣故，南洋銀元市價和中國的不同也是一個原因。例如星加坡銀元一元，三四年前値上海大洋三元，現在雖低了些，但一百元星加坡錢仍合上海洋一百七十五元左右。從前，他們從星加坡匯一百元到上海就變成三百元，以三百元購買書物，到星加坡又照該地的洋價賣出，這中間是有好幾倍的利息的。不過，近年來南洋爲不景氣籠罩着，買書的人少得多了，所以這個生意現在也是很不好做的了。</p>
<p>名人訪問記</p>
<h3>徐朗西訪問記</h3>
<p>— 道昆</p>
<p>徐朗西先生雖然已經是四五十歲的人了，但其積極生活的精神，恐怕有許多靑年都趕不上他罷。無論怎樣冷或熱的天氣，只要天明，他就起床了；接着就開始他一天的工作。所以，凡是要去訪問他的人，不管你習慣如何，早上還不到六點鐘就要動身到他家裏去，否則，他一早出門了，你走去便會落空，見不着他的。</p>
<p>我去訪問徐先生，當然也是很早就到他家裏的。當我走到他的會客室門前的時候，就見有三五個中年人正圍着一位鬚髯飄飄精神奕奕的長者在談話，我認識這位年長的人就是徐朗西先生，於是我便走了進去，在徐先生的和靄地接待之下，選了一個坐位安身了。</p>
<p>在照例的幾句寒暄語之後，我卽開始</p>
<p>「徐先生近來做些什麽事情，可以吿訴我們嗎？」</p>
<p>「怎麽不可以呢？我是已經决心盡我的力量，努力於文化事業。」他這樣說的時候，眼光是顯得特别明銳，聲音也非常響亮，談吐當然也是很流利的。那神氣，使你見了可以馬上感到這位長者的談風是很容易征服人的。</p>
<p>「是的，新華藝專據說是徐先生辦的，想現在成績一定很好······」</p>
<p>「怎樣好，也難說，不過，我想只要努力幹下去，總是可以一天一天地好起來的。我以爲一切努力都不會落空，只要肯幹，什麽事情都辦得好的。丨丨一勤天下無難事！」</p>
<p>「是的，過去徐先生不是曾主編過一個呌做「朔望」的雜誌嗎？很好，但是爲什麽停刋了呢？」</p>
<p>「啊，原因很多，譬如　經濟困難」之類。不過，文化事業很多，一個「朔望」雜誌停了，還可以做别的事情。我是絕不灰心的！」他的健狀的手搖動着，表示出一種非常堅决的態度。</p>
<p>「聽說徐先生正在創辦一個圖書館，不知現在進行得如何了？」</p>
<p>「是的，正在購置圖書。」</p>
<p>「現在已經有好多書了？」</p>
<p>「一萬多册，還要繼續購置！」</p>
<p>「館址在新華嗎？」</p>
<p>「現在暫設新華。不過，馬上就要另建新屋了，就在新華附近。」</p>
<p>「徐先生是現化書局的董事長，聽說現代經理洪雪帆君已去世了，今後「現代」如何，想來徐先生是早有計劃的。·········」</p>
<p>「說不上。不過，大家的意思都主張實行緊縮政策。「現代」雜誌和别的刋物，大槪都要暫時停刋，以减少開支。</p>
<p>······」</p>
<p>這時候，别的幾位客人，忽然因爲政客與文人的性情問題起了爭論。於是，健談的徐朗西先生卽刻掉轉舌頭，滔滔不絕地發表了他對這問題的意見丨丨</p>
<p>「政客當然長於交際，他們隨便遇到什麽人，都是一見如故，表示出非常親切，非常關心的樣子。假如這時有一位政客到我們這兒來，那此間的空氣馬上就要緊張，活躍，因爲他要和此地的每一個人握手，談話，並要述說他曾見了某些聞人的事情。但是，你要明白，政客們的感情是虚僞的，他們只知道交際，應酬，並沒有眞實的情誼。我可以說，假如你在這裏遇到一位政客，不管他對你怎樣好，只要走出門以後，他就不會認得你了！文人呢？他們也許不長於交際應酬，而且性情或都還有點孤傲，但我要說他們的情誼是眞實的。············」</p>
<p>以後的談話便就很雜亂了：忽而講靑年生活問題，忽而又說到中國戲劇問題，忽而講梅蘭芳，忽而又說到張學斌，······丨丨人多嘴雜，眞不知道談了多少事情。但是，在這些談論中，無論講到什麽，徐朗西先生都有最有趣味的意見。例如，當大家談着現代的戀愛問題時，他就直率地說：</p>
<p>「戀愛嗎？完全是爲金錢所支配的。只要你有錢，有金鋼鑽的戒指，包管可以得到許多人的愛情。不信，請你戴一個項大的金鋼鑽戒指，走到馬路上去，必然會有很多人來愛你的！」</p>
<p>接着便是大家一陣哄笑。我便在這哄笑之後，吿辭出來。</p>

<h3>運鹽</h3>
<p>— 周明</p>
<p>（貴陽通信）　「不要你做官做府，但願你揹鹽巴（卽磚鹽，產自四川自流井）一百四五」，這話差不多成爲農民們敎訓子孫的唯一信條了。因爲貴州不產鹽的緣故，食鹽完全仰給於四川，在川黔通衢的大道上，無時無刻不看見運鹽的隊伍。他們已經把運鹽專門化了。他們的名字呌「鹽巴老二」。這些專門家運鹽的方式有種種的不同，在上黔北一帶多半是用「背杵」，在黔北一帶多半是用「扁担」和「包簍」；但是運用着原始的氣力，在萬里長途中一步一步地滑，是沒有絲毫兩樣的。</p>
<p>號稱「山國」的貴州，山路的崎嶇崢嶸，階梯的層層疊疊，幾乎是成天的在山巒上打轉，平地是太少了，往往一上一下就化了一個白天。有時在山麓起脚，就顯然的望得見山巓，那山道築成了無數的「之」字拐，整整走了。半天，也不過僅是到達山巔。在這種情形之下，如飛的健步是不可能的了。你得把一切的力量放在脚跟上，踏上一步，再伸一步的向前展。揹着鹽的鹽巴老二，腰是已經够彎的了，還不成，還得盡量的彎下去。你假如很留心的在走路的話，你會發現在路旁的石板上有排列得還算整齊的漩渦，深深的，那是運鹽者在疲乏的時候需要</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>休息，所以把揹着的鹽息在牛角形的杵上，足蹲着，杵柄鑽在石板上刻下了他們的成績。</p>
<p>他們的任務是把鹽運了來，再運别的東西去。此外還有一種駝鹽或别的貨物的「駝馬」，那是組成隊伍的，每隊十隻，三五十隻不等。在沿途，山坡上，總有幾家供運鹽者吃飯和抽鴉片烟的小店，老遠你就可以在對聯上看見：「前途正遙遙，客，請坐，新鮮飯，　豆花（卽熱豆腐團），加得鋼來，邁開大步。」這一類的警語，這是正中心坎的。兩百個錢一碗的「冒耳頭」（卽添得尖尖的一碗飯）至少得噉上兩碗。吃完飯再張眼一看，會有别的妙語使你高興，如：「筋疲力竭困難當，一到南烟，呑雲吐霧精神爽。一這裏又得化去一百錢，或者幾百。他們明知道吸鴉片是有害的，而且「孤魂燈照見拱手猴子，烟扞子挑盡萬貫家財。」的奧義，是透澈得爛熟了，但他們因爲要用氣力來和山打鬭，鴉片烟還是非抽不可的。</p>
<p>一提到山，「九龍三溝」是不能忘記的，那裏藴藏着一些使人心驚肉跳的事情。九龍，據說有九個峯，在峯脚下可以看見三段河，路沿山腰而過，甚或跨過山峯，那下面是很深很深的懸岩。山路曲折，迎面不見人，路又窄，壁又峻峭，一遇着駝馬可就進退維谷了。有一次被駝馬擠掉一個人下去，自然是粉骨碎身了；後來他們得到了敎訓，老是沿着石壁走，殊不知又把駝馬擠掉了下去。因此，在馬帮提議之下，攔路徵工，經過一個月的開鑿，算是築成了一條闊約三尺的大路。</p>
<p>駝馬是一種極爲可憐的生物，頸子長長地，扁而枯乾，頭總是抬不起來。背部太令人可怕了，眞個似受了霉毒的侵襲，鮮紅的，紫黑的，白皚皚的，組成了一個個的瘡洞，那是被馬槖子（卽便於載物的木鞍）打壞了的肌肉。有的地方是平滑得一根毛也沒有，燦爛發光。至於鹽巴老二哩，因着運鹽工具的不同，也有着各色各樣的典型。用「背杵」的肩骨和胸前，老是有兩條顯著的血痕，而背多半是發了疹子的。用「扁担」的兩肩，高聳着兩個肉瘤，其邊沿泛溢着成熟了的桃子似的血紅；這是因爲「蹺扁担」的一閃一縮，重力集中在一點的緣故。「包簍」的肩上，是一塊棕黑而堅靭的硬壳，壳下有很多縐縐的曲綫。</p>
<p>大槪春秋二季是他們幸運的時節。一到夏天可爲難了，汗水直淌着，濕透了衣衫，面龐和胸前開出了無數道的運河。那末，他們用什麽方法來防堵的哩？他們用竹麻紥成了像短髯一樣的帶，捆在眉上，防止汗水向眼睛裏侵襲，用竹篦製成個環，刮去汗珠，再用手巾拂拭。在路上，除了到達站口或　店子，是沒有開水好喝的，沒有辦法，就祇好飲田水或泉水；因此，痧疫就流行了；眼睛一花，把鹽扔在一邊，痛死痛活地起不來了。治痧的妙法，是在病者的手彎裏吐上兩口唾沫，拍幾下，用力的抓上幾把，使皮膚由紅而紫，幾乎快出血的樣子，這樣，病就算好了。</p>
<p>冬天哩，除了下雪，就是綿綿不斷的細雨，路是滑滑的，運鹽時須注意把鹽包得好好的。鹽在陰雨天是要回潮的，倘若失了分量的話，鹽號裏是不肯收的。</p>

<h3>滑冰與國民性</h3>
<p>— 李葵</p>
<p>滑冰是頂好的運動。冬天，在寒冷的北方，滑冰這種運動就像：夏天，在炎熱的南方，游泳這種運動一樣的盛行。現在正是冬天，我又想起了滑冰這種運動。現在我就把這種運動在哈爾濱的情形略略的說一下子。</p>
<p>在北方，不論是多寛多深的河或江，到冬天都要結成很厚很厚的冰的，冰面有的地方像鏡子一樣的平（這就是天然的滑冰塲，此外還有人工澆的滑冰塲）於是滑冰者就穿上冰鞋在冰面上滑跑了。</p>
<p>他們滑冰時所取的方式和表現出來的精神，是隨着所屬國籍的不同而不同的。哈爾濱的住民大約有三種：最多的是中國人，其次是俄國人，再其次是日本人。茲分述如左：</p>
<p>中國人滑冰是好玩花樣的。他們總是在光溜溜的冰塲上左一歪，右一倒的，向前跑又向後退的玩耍着，也或者用脚底下的冰刀在冰面上劃出幾個英文字，如：Iloveyoy!······之類。他們玩耍得很自然，就像一些快活的小鳥，翩翩的飛來飛去似的。外觀上是非常好看的，可是，他們已經失去了滑冰的眞義，他們不是拿滑冰當運動，他們是拿滑冰當遊戲了。</p>
<p>俄國人滑冰是帶着探險性的。他們總是邁着大步，向遼遠的不知處跑去。</p>
<p>日本人滑冰是非常技巧的。他們不玩沒有用的花樣，也不去冒險。他們只是在冰面上不停的跑着，跑着，就像一羣探水的燕子似的，從這裏飛到那裏，從那裏又飛到這裏。他們滑冰的目的，完全是爲着運動身體。他們往往一跑就是兩點鐘，足足跑到不能再跑時才停止。停止後就坐在冰塊上休息，像蒸氣一樣的熱氣從他們的頭上冒着。他們也不唱歌，也不說笑，他們只是默默的休息着。就是非常開心，也不肯表示出來。</p>
<p>從這裏，我們可以看出三個國民性的不同來。雖然這些滑冰者並不足以代表出他們整個的國民性，但是，總不致相差太遠吧！</p>

<p>開始我就要說「不幸得很」，一直到現在，我們還沒有一本系統的科學的關於中國文學史的書籍；不但如此，而且我們還沒有台恩，蘭松······等類人物，還沒有比較進步的有系統的中國文學史的著作；呈現於我們眼前的什麽中國文學「大史」「小史」以及什麽中國文學「史綱」「史要」等類東西，不是登記書名人名的流水賬簿，便是帶着「疑古」或「信古」的氣味的先生們努力堆集一些死古董的舊的字紙簍，根本就沒有什麽價値。因此，要研究中國文學史實在是一件很困難的事情：不僅沒有一本好的書籍可以作我們研究的依據，而且就是蒐集材料，整理材料，選擇材料，也都很成問題。</p>
<p>然而，不管怎樣，中國文學史總是需要正確的科學方法去研究的。這正確的科學方法並不有待於我們來創造，早已有些六思想家爲我們預備好了。現在雖還沒有一本科學的中國文學史的書籍，但只要我們能用這已有的科學方法去努力研究，總是會產生出科學的完善的中國文學史的著作的。</p>
<p>那麽，我們要用怎樣的科學方法來研究中國文學史呢？</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang, along with Wang Yizhe, Shen Honglie, and more than ten people including advisor Donald, arrived in Nanjing at 12:30 PM on the Changxing Wheel. Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, Garrison Commander Gu Zhenglun, and Chief of the Police Bureau Chen Zhuo, among others, all came to the riverbank to welcome them.

At 2:00 PM, Zhang, accompanied by Donald, visited Chairman Chiang to report on the bandit suppression situation in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Minister He. Zhang stated that he came to attend the Fifth Plenary Session, pay his respects to Chairman Chiang, report on the military affairs of bandit suppression in the three provinces, and request instructions on everything. He himself had no proposals for the Fifth Plenary Session. After the plenary session closes, he will immediately return to Wuhan. The bandit suppression military affairs have been proceeding smoothly recently. The main force of the remaining bandits has been completely destroyed. All the remaining bandits who are wreaking havoc on the border of Sichuan are being surrounded and suppressed on all sides, and it is expected that they will be annihilated soon. (1st Daily Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yizhe said that after repeated encirclement and suppression by the armies in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, the remnants of the bandits have been completely defeated and will be wiped out soon.

After the pursuit and suppression by various armies, the false 28th army was completely annihilated, and the false 25th army was mostly resolved. The remaining less than a thousand people fled to the Tai County area in southwestern Henan, attempting to flee to Sichuan. They are currently being surrounded and suppressed by various departments, and it is expected that they will be eliminated within a month. The military affairs of bandit suppression have now come to an end. The post-bandit-area reconstruction is indeed an urgent task at present. However, construction after destruction is not difficult, as long as the economy is abundant. Finally, he said that he had no proposals for the plenary session. He had read the telegrams of gratitude from Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, and the points they raised are indeed the essential measures at present. (1st Central News Agency Electric)</p>

<h3>Cigarette Tax Stamps Are Still Sold and Used in Installments</h3>

The China Construction Bank will pay the Central Bank 2.5 million yuan of tax tickets each month and collect the current funds in full. If the cigarette tax stamps are not sold for 2.5 million yuan by the end of the month, the tax funds will be allocated in full from the Central Bank without shortage to comply with the provisions of the contract.

<h3>A Certain Director-General of the Ministry of Finance Denies the Saying that Silver is Nationalized</h3>
<p>Silver Reserves in Shanghai Still Amount to Over 200 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Domestic Banks Account for 80 Percent</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Unscrupulous Merchants from Smuggling Silver Out of the Country</p>
<p>The Central Bank's Reserves are Extremely Adequate</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the implementation of the export tax on silver, the amount of outflow has been significantly reduced compared to before. However, the matter of exporting has not completely stopped, leading to rumors of tight money in the market, and even the saying that silver is nationalized and the redemption of banknotes is suspended. The Central News Agency reporter specially visited a certain Director-General of the Ministry of Finance on the 30th to inquire about the situation. According to him, it is true that silver is still flowing out at present, but it is not as much as the outside world has rumored. Moreover, most of the silver exported recently is done by foreign banks and a few unscrupulous merchants. There has not been much change in the silver reserves of domestic banks. According to investigation reports, the silver reserves in Shanghai used to be 540 million yuan, of which 55% belonged to foreign banks and 45% belonged to domestic banks. After several months of outflow, the current silver reserves are still over 200 million yuan. Although it has decreased by more than half compared to a few months ago, it is still ten times more than the Shanghai silver reserves of only 20 million yuan during the period from 1919 to 1920 due to the impact of the European war, when countries banned the export of gold and the price of silver soared. Currently, domestic banks account for more than 80% of the total silver reserves, while foreign banks account for less than 20%, which proves that most of the silver exported is stored by foreign banks, and there has been no change in the silver reserves of domestic banks. At this time of financial crisis, exporting silver has a negative impact on our country. However, in order to seek profit, even savings funds and reserves for issuing banknotes are exported in large quantities. Once a run or panic is caused, the first to be affected will still be their own banks. Facts have already proven this. Smart foreign bankers will certainly not be fooled again. As for speculative and unscrupulous merchants exporting silver, in addition to paying taxes and exporting, there are also those who use the excuse of regulating the market and transport large amounts of silver dollars to Xiamen, Shantou, and other places, and then smuggle them out without paying taxes. These people only know personal interests and do not know the interests of the country, which is extremely painful to say. On the government side, since the balance tax law has been implemented, it is not difficult to increase the balance tax rate to be equal to the difference between the London silver price and the Shanghai silver price, so that silver exporters have no profit to be made. The current tax rate of only 70% of the difference is to facilitate legitimate merchants. Because our country is a country with import surplus, in addition to offsetting the price of goods coming in and out, silver must be exported to pay for the import surplus loans. If the tax rate is increased, merchants will inevitably suffer losses. The government reduces taxes out of consideration for merchants, but unscrupulous merchants take the opportunity to make profits, so as not to harm the interests of the country. Those with a little conscience should not do this. In addition, according to the usual practice of domestic silver transportation, a permit passport from the Ministry and an exemption passport from the Ministry of Military Affairs are required before transportation can begin. Now, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from transshipping and smuggling, the previous order is reiterated and enforced more strictly than before, which is indeed a necessary measure. The outside world is unaware of this and makes many criticisms, which are not worth refuting. In short, in addition to strictly investigating and handling the smuggling of silver by unscrupulous merchants, the Ministry also strictly supervises domestic banks in accordance with legal procedures. The banks themselves are also very self-respecting, and the reserves for savings funds and issuing banknotes are extremely adequate, especially the Central Bank's cash reserves are over 70%, and marketable securities are over 20%. The adequacy of the reserves is rare among national banks of various countries. This situation of fully sufficient reserves has been proven by the business and is by no means empty propaganda. Even if money is tight, it will definitely not affect the redemption of banknotes, which can be asserted. As for the nationalization of silver, it is even more nonexistent.

<h3>Zhao Lianfang, Director of the Agricultural Department of the Economic Commission, Talks About His Inspection Experience</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Lianfang, Director of the Agricultural Department of the Economic Commission, returned to Nanjing from Shaanxi on the 1st. According to his account, he left Beijing on July 16th, first went to Xi'an to inspect the rural areas of various districts in Shaanxi, and negotiated with the provincial authorities to form the Shaanxi Agricultural Cooperation Affairs Bureau, which has already been established. After spending a month in Shaanxi, he went to Gansu to investigate the livestock situation, passing through Lanzhou, Xiliangzhou, Ganzhou, and other counties, as well as Hezhou and Taohe counties in the south. The rural scenery was very bleak, especially in Liangzhou. In the area within 200 to 300 li around Liangzhou, 40% of the people have fled, and most of the houses have collapsed, leaving only the ruins. The reasons are: 1. Years of drought, 2. Last year's earthquake, 3. Ma Zhongying's troops' slaughter. He then went to the Songshan pasture 200 li west of Lanzhou, and the Dama Camp pasture at the border of Qinghai, where the water and grass are suitable. He then went to Xining, first to the Tiebujia pasture near Haixi Dulan County, and then inspected four pastures in the Dahe Dam area of ​​Gonghe County. He spent more than ten days in Haixi, because the nomadic Tibetan tribes there are naturally strong, there are no inns along the way, and it is very dangerous to travel. They brought their own dry food and tents and traveled with a cavalry team, so they were relatively safe along the way. He then returned to Xining and went to southeastern Qinghai to inspect the many pastures in Hualong, Xunhua, and Tongren counties, and carefully inspected the Ganping Temple pasture between Tongren and Xiahe. The pasture is hundreds of li wide and the water and grass are convenient, making it very suitable for animal husbandry. The pasture is five stations away from both Xining and Lanzhou. After inspection, it was decided that this pasture is more suitable, and the transportation is also better than the Gansu pasture. The surrounding livestock production is abundant, especially the sheep. It was decided that this pasture would be used by the department to breed good livestock, and Su Han Zhuo was appointed as the director of the pasture to engage in development and selection of good breeds.

<h3>An Appeal to the Citizens for Universal Donations for Urgent Relief in Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted by a government agency in August, since the beginning of summer this year, the whole country has been hit by water and drought disasters, with losses exceeding 100 million yuan. The affected area is almost two-thirds of the country's land. There are 369 counties affected by drought in 14 provinces, and 120 counties affected by floods in 13 provinces. In addition, 68 counties in 8 provinces have suffered locust plagues, and 89 counties in 12 provinces have suffered from wind and hail. The extent of the disaster and the magnitude of the losses are even greater than the major floods that shocked China and foreign countries in 1931. Although there are no statistical reports on the number of people affected by the disaster, it can be inferred from reason that it is also more than the 25 million people in the major floods of that year. The severity of this year's disaster can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Those most affected by the natural disasters are the common people with an annual income of less than 300 yuan. These people, after years of famine and the collapse of the countryside, have exhausted their reserves. They are already living from hand to mouth in the spring and summer seasons, barely surviving. Now, misfortune does not come alone, and they have suffered this great disaster. The autumn harvest is hopeless, and they will inevitably be left to die. Thus, every family weeps in tattered clothes, and everyone sighs in despair. There have been repeated reports of entire families committing suicide or fleeing. Recently, as winter has arrived, the situation is even more desperate. They are suffering from both hunger and cold, a truly tragic situation. Fellow citizens, we are all human beings. The heart of compassion is in everyone. Thinking of the disaster victims, how can we not feel deeply grieved?</p>
<p>But today, simply expressing sympathy will not help the disaster victims. Those who have a truly compassionate heart should make generous donations. The fish trapped in a dried-up rut desperately seek rescue. The begging letters and telegrams from various places published in the newspapers appear almost every day. In general, the language is poignant and unbearable to read. Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have a wife and children? Thinking of others as we think of ourselves, we will understand. Moreover, while it is pitiful for one person to starve to death, we should also consider the danger of turning to crime. Today, the starving are everywhere, waiting to be fed. If we do not provide timely relief, the cunning and mischievous will inevitably gather together to cause trouble, adding to the worries of society. Unfortunately, if it comes to this, it will be impossible to stand by and take care of oneself alone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the prosperity of the city depends on the recovery of the interior. If the rural areas of the interior are devastated by this disaster and never recover, the city will inevitably be permanently deprived of the opportunity to revive. As citizens of Shanghai, we should be concerned about the hunger and suffering of others and give generously to help the public. We should show sincerity and answer the call for help. This is not only doing our best for charity, but it also contains a deep meaning of self-preservation.</p>
<p>However, looking at the efforts to provide disaster relief in Shanghai this year, although various charitable organizations have been actively engaged, there have been no large-scale fundraising campaigns. On October 15th, people from all walks of life gathered at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to form the Drought Relief Association, and prominent figures from various fields were elected as leaders on the spot to actively plan. The plan seemed ambitious, but it was still somewhat lacking compared to the repeated city-wide donation drives during the major floods of the previous year. Recently, the municipal government, in light of this, specially convened a meeting of party, government, military, and group organizations to discuss this matter, and the Shanghai Municipal Universal Donation Association for Urgent Relief in Disaster Areas was established. It is scheduled to start operating today, bringing together representatives from various agencies and groups to work together to awaken the citizens of Shanghai to actively donate and generously assist in helping with the famine this year and hoping for a bountiful harvest next year. Not only will tens of millions of disaster victims benefit from reconstruction, but it will also be the glory of the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>France Will Not Flow With Japan and Refuses the Joint Destruction of the Sea Treaty</p>
<h3>Italy Expresses the Same Attitude, Britain and Japan Hold Private Consultations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The French Charge d'Affaires, Billa, visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:00 AM today. Regarding Japan's previous urging to jointly abolish the Washington Treaty, the French government formally replied with a subtle refusal, saying that France was also dissatisfied with the current ratio of the Washington Treaty and had strongly advocated revision. However, it was difficult to immediately agree to the Japanese government's proposal to jointly abolish it. In addition, the Italian ambassador will also give the same reply as France next week. (1st day Dentsu telegram)</p>
<p>(London) As the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan are holding talks in London, British people are quite worried about Japan's request that France and Italy simultaneously declare the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty. First, they fear that the scope of the three-nation talks will be expanded, immediately involving France and Italy. Second, although the French government will not declare the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty itself, it is feared that it will take some action towards the Tokyo government, causing Japan's attitude to become more determined. At this time, when the naval talks are turning to the technical aspects and focusing on delaying time, Britain is conducting diplomatic negotiations with France and Italy, so that France and Italy will not be affected by Japan. However, the French government is outside the three-nation talks and has no intention of interfering. British people can rest assured about this. It is hoped that the countries concerned will not add to each other with "faits accomplis," as they did during the Washington Naval Conference in the past. In Italy, it is also said that since the Washington Treaty allows Italy's battleship tonnage to be equal to that of France, unless a "miracle" occurs, there is absolutely no reason to declare the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty.

<p>Naval Talks Turn to Qualitative Discussion</p>
<h3>Yamamoto Presents Technical Figures</h3>
<p>(London) The Japanese naval representative, Yamamoto, had an important conversation with Sir Chatfield, the British Chief of Naval Staff, today. Yamamoto handed over to Chatfield the technical figures that Japan could give as an answer to the British qualitative question. Afterwards, Yamamoto told a Reuters reporter that he could not be said to be more optimistic, but he now had a clearer understanding of the British technical views. The opinions he provided to Chatfield, regarding the outline that future naval talks could follow, were purely his own opinions and had not been discussed with the Japanese government or with his colleagues. This conversation did not raise any new factors, and Japan's original proposal was not affected by it in any way. His conversation with Chatfield could be regarded as an expression of how the United Kingdom and Japan want their navies to be in the future. According to the opinions Yamamoto expressed to Chatfield, the Japanese navy in the future will be very different from what it is now. Japan aims to actively reduce it, but judging from today's conversation, Yamamoto fears that there will not be much change, at least not a sudden change. The next meeting will be at Walton's lunch and golf game tomorrow, when naval issues will be discussed again. British Foreign Secretary Simon, US Representative Davis, and Standerley will all attend. After Yamamoto met with Chatfield, Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira immediately met with US Representative Davis to tell him about Yamamoto's conversation with Chatfield. Although Yamamoto did not seem overly optimistic about the future, those who heard it expressed satisfaction, believing that the Japanese are now</p>

<p>Points of Agreement and Disagreement Between Britain and Japan</p>
<h3>Britain Is Reluctant to Reduce Battleships</h3>
<p>(London) It is believed that the following conclusions were reached regarding the technical agreements and disagreements between the United Kingdom and Japan during yesterday's British-Japanese talks. (1) In order to defend its scattered territories, the United Kingdom intends to expand its cruisers and destroyers. Japan recognizes that this is equivalent to defensive ship types and expresses its agreement. Also, the United Kingdom hopes to increase the number of cruisers from 50 to 70. If it is an increase in light warships, the Japanese side is prepared to consider and acknowledge it. (1) Regarding battleships, the British side is quite reluctant to reduce the current level. The Japanese side believes that the navies of the three countries must be purely defensive in order to achieve true disarmament. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce battleships. Although it can express agreement with the British increase in light cruisers, the battleships must be reduced to offset this increase before there is room for consideration. Under these circumstances, the gap between Chatfield's battleship construction plan and Yamamoto's representative's opinion is very obvious. (1) Regarding future warship construction, if it is an autonomous declaration, it is prepared to consider it if the contract terms do not harm Japan's demand for equal rights. It also does not object to setting the provisional period at five years. (1st day Dentsu telegram)</p>
<p>Japan Exerts Its Skills</p>
<h3>Striving to Avoid Introducing Political Issues</h3>
<p>(London) During the British-American talks last week, some advocated introducing political issues to contain Japan's demand for equal rights. However, the Japanese delegation cleverly unfolded the situation and dispelled the British and American plans. At the same time, Prime Minister Okada and Foreign Minister Hirota advocated thorough disarmament, expressing that Japan will be a champion of world disarmament. Therefore, Britain highly appreciates the success of Japan's diplomatic operations. (30th day Dentsu telegram)</p>
<p>The United States Firmly Refuses to Relax Its Current Rate</p>
<h3>Expressing Regret Over Hirota's Remarks</h3>
<p>(New York) Various newspapers believe that the speech given yesterday by Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota in the Japanese Diet is insufficient to encourage the hope of a successful conclusion to the London Naval Talks, and therefore, express much regret. The US government is determined to maintain its existing 5:5:3 naval ratio and will not relax its stance. If Japan unilaterally abolishes the Washington Naval Treaty, the United States will build 78 new warships from now until the end of 1936, when the Washington Treaty expires, in addition to the 68 warships currently under construction. In general, American public opinion is very calm about naval issues, even downplaying them, and is more concerned about domestic issues. Representative Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, issued a statement yesterday, saying that if Japan declares the treaty abolished, the United States will maintain the 5:5:3 ratio, and if Japan builds three warships, the United States will build five. Some American commentators say that Vinson's statement is of no practical help because it fails to induce Japan to compromise. In addition, Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed opposition to the arms race, saying that the current financial situation of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan is one of exhaustion, and that they are almost bankrupt in legal terms. If they still want to engage in an arms race, it would be akin to madness. The immediate solution is to consult the people who pay for military spending and shed blood for the country before proceeding. Finally, Senator Shipstead of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party fears that the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are more concerned about the current situation than the United States and may be plotting against the United States. This opinion is largely held by people in agricultural areas who, since the Great War and the issue of war debts, no longer trust European countries and therefore have such concerns.

Swanson said that it was gratifying to restore the Navy's position, enabling it to assume its responsibilities for the current unstable situation. The Navy is willing to reduce its military strength in concert with other countries, but in view of the magnitude of the stakes, it should maintain an invincible fleet. There has been significant progress in filling the Navy to the limits allowed by the treaties. The ongoing naval replenishment occupies a strong 78%, but the minimum safety limit should be 85%. If this is not addressed promptly, the vessel replenishment will be even more insufficient when the 68 warships in the shipbuilding program are completed. The serious impact of the shortage of fleet personnel on war preparations cannot be overstated, and this is a serious danger in the event of unexpected events, as warships should be prepared to repel enemies at all times. The report listed the performance of squadron flights from Panama to the United States and from the US mainland to Hawaii and Alaska, proving that the naval aviation corps has made satisfactory progress. Swanson therefore stated that the American naval aviation corps can be called the world's best. A detailed report was also given on the number and nature of large vessels that have not reached fleet age, stating that at the beginning of this year, the United States had 92 major vessels, the United Kingdom had 139, and Japan had 165. As for those with funding secured and still under construction, the United States has 68, the United Kingdom has 62, and Japan has 45. To reach the limits allowed by the treaties, the United States needs 78, the United Kingdom needs 44, and Japan needs 1. (30th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Tens of Thousands of Acres of Land Submerged, Thousands Homeless</h3>
<p>Melbourne - Melbourne is experiencing the most severe flood in its history today, with multiple deaths, tens of thousands of acres of land submerged, and hundreds of houses destroyed.

Within a few hours, as far as the eye could see, there was a vast expanse of water, and the wind has not abated. The decorations for the centenary celebration have all been destroyed. Many houses have been damaged by the wind and floods. Many trains were stranded midway due to high water levels and could not move forward. The flood struck unexpectedly, and it is reported that thousands of cattle, sheep, and horses in Victoria's pastures have drowned. Officials are currently raising relief funds and sending personnel to disaster areas to rescue flood victims sheltering on rooftops. (1st Reuters telegram)</p>

<h3>Russia and France Join Hands to Maintain Peace, Urge Germany to Return to Geneva, and Will Not Compromise on Germany's Military Build-Up</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Laval read a declaration to the Chamber of Deputies today, addressing various urgent issues. Laval urged Germany to re-enter the League of Nations and called on Hitler, now that he has declared his desire for peace, to emulate France's policies in Eastern Europe. France will not accept the de facto situation created by Germany's military build-up, even if Germany decides to return to Geneva, France will not compromise. Although France and Soviet Russia share the same views on defending peace in Europe, there will be no bilateral understanding between the two countries. Franco-Italian friendship may extend to all European countries without excluding any country, but the current borders must be maintained. France will reduce its armaments when it believes the country can achieve security. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Laval declared to the Chamber of Deputies today that France does not want to sacrifice any treaty in pursuit of a Franco-Russian alliance, and that Franco-Russian unity will be entirely based on the interests of all countries and the maintenance of peace in Eastern Europe, and will be pursued in a fair and open manner. Recently, some in the Chamber of Deputies have mentioned a Franco-Russian alliance to deal with Germany. Laval's speech today was in response to this. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies discussed the foreign affairs budget today. Foreign Minister Laval gave a speech, saying, "France's own interests are in line with the interests of peace. If we want to maintain it, we must have a strong national power, and the maintenance of order and sound finances are essential elements of strong national power. The people of Europe are apprehensive, and the people of all countries demand that the authorities take real actions to maintain peace, not just express hope with empty words. Laval wants to participate in the organization of peace on a broad scale and thus coordinate the work of various countries. Regarding the issue of rapprochement between Italy and France, Laval said that Italy and France have the same desire for peace and should conduct negotiations to make the friendship between the two sides closer. However, during the negotiations, it is necessary to find ways to ensure that Italy and the countries of the Little Entente can be close, especially the rapprochement between Italy and Yugoslavia, otherwise the purpose of the negotiations cannot be fully achieved. The good results of the rapprochement between France and Italy should be enjoyed by all friendly countries, so that a broad group in Europe can benefit from it. "This principle cannot be sacrificed in order to consolidate the Franco-Italian alliance." Laval continued, saying that France has always been loyal to its allies, especially to Yugoslavia, which suffered misfortune in the Marseille assassination. As for the negotiations to guarantee Austria's independence, they must be made to consolidate peace in Central Europe. Laval then spoke about the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, saying that the government is also conducting negotiations on this matter. France will cooperate with any country that has peaceful intentions with an impartial attitude, regardless of whether its internal affairs are the same as those of France. This goal is none other than maintaining peace in Eastern Europe. Laval said, "Any country can participate in the negotiations on the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, and its purpose is not to oppose any country. However, there is one principle that everyone should recognize, that is, the current borders should be maintained." Laval also said that France and Soviet Russia are working together to maintain peace in Eastern Europe, so that everyone can feel its benefits. This is an open matter. "We have invited Germany to participate in the negotiations on the Mutual Assistance Pact, and we will continue to invite them in the future. Germany can also enjoy the guarantees that the pact can give to all countries." Laval continued, saying that German leader and Chancellor Hitler has expressed his desire for peace, and France is asking him to participate in the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, precisely to turn his desire into a real action. Laval believes that if war does occur, it will extend to all parts of Europe and cannot be limited to a certain area of Europe. Now, if more mutual assistance pacts are signed, until all European countries are included, then France itself can reduce the risk of war, and international credit can be restored. International credit is a necessary condition for all countries to limit and reduce armaments. Regarding the organization of peace, it is hoped that Germany can participate. Since Hitler has repeatedly spoken of peace, he certainly cannot reject the organization of peace, and "participation in peace requires Germany to devote all its spiritual strength to it, because Germany's cooperation has a decisive relationship with European security and its future." Laval also said that France's actions will not go beyond the scope of international organizations (referring to the League of Nations). France regards the development of the League of Nations as an indispensable condition for maintaining peace. As for the Saar issue, France asks other countries to come forward and assist in order to maintain order there. Laval concluded by saying that some people believe that the efforts made by international organizations to maintain peace have different purposes, and therefore, they have anxieties. He hopes that this kind of misconception will disappear from now on. As for the close cooperation between the United Kingdom and France, it is the main guarantee of peace in Europe. It is gratifying that the two countries now have completely the same opinions. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Ministry's budget proposal was submitted for discussion in the Chamber of Deputies today. The reporter, Central Party member D'Allier, made a statement, first expressing condolences to the late King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, French Foreign Minister Barthou, and former President Poincaré. He then reviewed the following international issues: (1) the conditions for rapprochement between Italy and France, (2) the issue of the union of Germany and Austria, (3) the increasing consolidation of the Nazi dictatorship in Germany, (4) the threat from Germany in the field of aviation, and the warning from British Privy Councilor Baldwin (referring to Baldwin's speech in the House of Commons the day before), (5) the issue of Swiss neutrality, (6) the Saar region plebiscite, (7) the issue of rapprochement between France and Russia, (8) the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact and the relationship between France and Poland. The conclusion was that France should maintain a calm attitude and pay close attention to the international situation. When D'Allier's statement mentioned the issue of Swiss neutrality, he said that it was quite believable that Swiss neutrality might be violated during wartime (referring to being violated by Germany), because it was possible to attack southeastern France via Switzerland, and the defense there was quite weak. "Currently, the Allied countries are very sorry for the shortcomings of the defense in southeastern France. Although we are not overly alarmed, we also take this warning seriously." D'Allier then mentioned the Soviet Union's assistance to France in the event of war, saying that the Soviet Union's assistance was quite strong and should be obtained, but it should not be overemphasized because the Soviet Union was far away and it was difficult to transport troops to the necessary locations. Regarding the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, D'Allier said that it should not be rashly joined, and attention should be paid to the following two points: (1) avoid being bound to guarantee Russia's borders outside Europe, (2) Japanese commercial competition is aggressive and may cause friction with Western countries, and Japan and Russia are mutually opposed, so there is even more possibility of conflict with Russia. However, this kind of friction is economic in nature and should not be allowed to enter the political sphere. D'Allier mentioned the relationship between France and Poland, saying that Poland has recently signed an agreement with Germany to end the customs war. This agreement does not hinder the Franco-Polish alliance and is a success of the economic reconciliation policy, which France should be happy about. Finally, D'Allier praised Foreign Minister Laval, saying that he was thoughtful, cautious and decisive, and although future diplomatic negotiations are extremely delicate, he believes that Laval will be able to work closely with Premier Flandin to make France's views prevail. This view is the view held by countries that cherish peace in Europe." (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Germany's Military Build-Up Relies on Diplomacy as a Backing</p>
<h3>The Desire for Peace Is Not Inferior to Others, Hitler Made It Clear</h3>
<p>(Paris) German special envoy for disarmament, General Ribbentrop, met with the leaders of French veterans today for three hours. The leaders presented the fears of the French people regarding the Saar plebiscite and Germany's military build-up. Ribbentrop replied that Germany now has a desire for peace, and the Nazi Party will not incite riots in the Saar. As for Germany's military build-up, Germany has the inherent right to establish a strong army for diplomatic purposes. Blood is not used as a weapon of war. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Foreign Minister Neurath, when meeting with a Reuters reporter today, stated that Germany, like other countries, is eager to eliminate the clouds of suspicion that have been sown in the European skies. The German government will pay sympathetic attention to any action that can improve the current situation. Unfortunately, the decision on this kind of matter is not only in Germany. When asked about the possibility of Germany re-entering the League of Nations, Neurath replied that Germany has repeatedly stated that Germany's fair request deserves free and sincere consideration. As the South African politician General Smuts said recently, Germany is willing to cooperate with all countries. If it is not certain that Germany will never be subjected to unfair discrimination again, Germany obviously cannot return to Geneva. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Goebbels Declares Germany's Raising Troops Is Not for War Preparation</p>
<h3>No Disarmament Without Equality</h3>
<p>Stettin - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave a speech last night on the issue of disarmament, saying that countries raise troops for war preparation, while our country raises troops to avoid war. Therefore, whoever wants to talk to us about disarmament will come at our call. However, if we are not given equal status, there will be no real peace in the world. Those who treat us equally, we are prepared to talk about disarmament with them, and the issue of disarmament can also be discussed on the basis of this. What we want to ask is that we have already disarmed, so why do we need to disarm again? If other countries are also willing to disarm to the same level as us, and are prepared to negotiate further, then they will call us and we will go. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Goal of British Policy Is to Safeguard the Authority of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Minister Simon gave a speech at a meeting in Scotland last night, saying that the main goal of the National Government's policy is none other than to safeguard and expand the authority of the League of Nations. If people talk about war in passionate terms and say that it is imminent and unavoidable, it is not conducive to the way of peace, because talking about war is not the way to establish peace. The only international organization that can maintain peace is the League of Nations. Unfortunately, the League of Nations has not yet included the whole world. Recently, Soviet Russia has joined, while Germany and Japan have withdrawn. In addition, the United States is also staying out of it. All these situations weaken the power of the League of Nations. However, the League of Nations has a very good influence on the cause of peace. The Foreign Minister concluded by saying that the United Kingdom should maintain friendly relations with all countries in the world. If it is said that the United Kingdom can guarantee the security and greatness of the British Empire by concluding special agreements with some of the great powers, then it is not something that they dare to believe.

<p>Hitler's Special Envoy Travels to France to Pave the Way for Hess</p>
<h3>The British House of Commons Debates the Issue of Armaments, Opening the Door to Direct Negotiations Between France and Germany</h3>
<p>A New Franco-German Trade Agreement Is Announced</p>
<p>(Paris) General Ribbentrop, Hitler's special envoy for armaments, whose actions have attracted general speculation, is now returning to Berlin, carrying with him a new compromise between France and Germany on economic issues. Ribbentrop discussed this matter with the French until 3:00 a.m. yesterday, and after sleeping for a while, resumed negotiations at 9:00 a.m. According to Berlin sources, Ribbentrop's trip to Paris is purely private in nature and will return to Berlin tomorrow. German officials are very secretive about the issue of armaments. People in Berlin believe that the British are probably using the debate on German armaments in the British House of Commons as the beginning of new negotiations, but the subsequent actions depend on the French side. At the same time, the Paris press believes that the main purpose of Ribbentrop's trip to France is to find a way to arrange a meeting between French Foreign Minister Laval and Hitler's representative Hess. The German diplomat Lersner has been in London for a week and does not seem to be returning to Germany in half a month. Lersner has been in England for a longer time, while Ribbentrop's stay in France has been quite short, which shows that London is a more suitable place for negotiations than Paris. Last night, Ribbentrop went to the French Chamber of Deputies to listen to its debate on foreign affairs. It is now heard that Hess will officially travel to Paris with Ribbentrop in mid-December.

<p>(Paris) A new commercial agreement between France and Germany was signed tonight. According to some sources, the agreement is only valid for three months. The current bill exchange system will continue to be used, but with slight modifications to maintain the balance of trade between the two countries. In addition, Germany owes France about 60 million French francs, and the new agreement also establishes a solution for its repayment. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Germany Can Handle the Saar Vote with Confidence</p>
<h3>Observations of a British Historian</h3>
<p>Breslau - British historian Beesly gave a speech at the university here, saying that according to historical records, the residents of the Saar region were Germans as early as 400 AD. In 925 AD, they were incorporated into the territory of German King Henry I, so the Saar should undoubtedly belong to Germany. In the 1910 census of the region, only 342 people were French citizens. Former French Prime Minister Clemenceau actually said at the Paris Peace Conference that 150,000 French people lived in the region, but in fact, it was the people of Lorraine who lived on the border. Therefore, Beesly said that according to his observations, Germany will win after the Saar vote. (30th National Telegram)</p>

<p>The Diet's Interrogation War Intensifies</p>
<h3>Nakajima Mentions the Pamphlet Issue and Rejects Attempts at Military Dictatorship</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives convened at 1:15 p.m. today. Seiyukai member Kunimatsu Hamada took the stage to question the issue of official discipline. Hamada said that if the judicial authorities use the law as their backing to implement unconstitutional acts, then the judicial authorities will become the target of national resentment. Although the current cabinet has strongly stated that it will uphold constitutional government, the establishment of constitutional government cannot be expected. Hamada then spoke of the corruption case of the Ministry of Finance officials, attacking the judicial authorities' attitude towards this case, calling it the emergence of legal fascism. His speech lasted for two hours. Minister of Justice Ohara responded to this, the same as his response in the House of Peers. Hamada also attacked Agriculture Minister Gotoh. Prime Minister Okada then descended from the stage. Next, Minseito member Yadanji Nakajima took the stage. He first raised the issue of the disaster budget. Regarding the measures taken by the Osaka Meteorological Observatory during the Kansai typhoon disaster, he attacked Minister of Education Matsuda. He then turned to the military budget, expressing his opposition to the huge military budget, saying that 60% of next year's budget is for the military budget, and the budget for rescuing rural areas has been greatly reduced. With no rural relief, what is national defense? Nakajima also mentioned the issue of the Army pamphlet, saying that we are not discussing whether or not to issue the pamphlet, but want to ask Army Minister Hayashi what his views are on the controlled economy advocated in the pamphlet. He also asked if Navy Minister Osumi had said that when the cancellation of the treaty leads to naval competition, he would find ways to avoid using funds, and what those methods were. Hamada finally questioned the Minister of Finance, saying that the Prime Minister stated yesterday that he would not implement general tax increases, and asked if the Minister of Finance's opinion was the same as the Prime Minister's. Hamada's questioning ended after an hour. Army Minister Hayashi first responded, saying that the pamphlet issued by the Ministry of the Army was based on national defense relations and published various social situations that the people should consider, but this was not a formal publication. The News Section of the Ministry of the Army printed and distributed it for the purpose of providing the people with reference material, so it only stated the points that the Army considered necessary to improve and did not advocate that the Army would immediately implement this plan. At this time, the assembly hall was in turmoil, and someone loudly questioned, "What about the future?" Next, Navy Minister Osumi responded, saying that the Japanese government's disarmament countermeasures, as stated by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, are fair and appropriate countermeasures. Representatives Matsudaira and Yamamoto are working hard on negotiations, and the details cannot be disclosed. Unfortunately, if the preparatory negotiations cannot be concluded satisfactorily, the claim that the countries will immediately start building ships and competing is not believable. After Japan announces the abrogation of the treaty, the treaty will still be in effect for the next two years. This period is a great opportunity for the countries to reflect. At this time, if there are those who reject Japan's fair and appropriate disarmament proposal, we will have to deal with it with a decisive determination. However, we do not hope that such a result will occur, because our plan is for national defense and security. Prime Minister Okada and Minister of Finance Takahashi also responded. Next, Seiyukai member Masazumi Ando questioned the issue of discipline, attacking the Prime Minister for the issue of corruption in the organs stationed in Manchuria and the issue of the cabinet's disunity. He also questioned Internal Affairs Minister Gotoh's responsibility for the issue of misleading the Imperial Regalia. He then raised the issue of the Army pamphlet, saying that we cannot agree with the Army's discussion centered on national defense, and that the people's livelihood is an important center. After the government responded to this, Minseito member Tanjiro Nishimura, Seiyukai member Ichimin Tabuchi, and Proletarian Party member Motojiro Sugiyama questioned the rural issues. Nationalist Alliance member Masataka Nakano questioned general administration issues. The meeting adjourned late at night. (1st Jiji dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Tibetan Prime Minister Responds, the Assembly Becomes Silent</h3>

Prime Minister Okada responded by saying that he recommended Takahashi as Finance Minister in view of the current financial situation of our country. Next, Takahashi stated, "Regardless of the outcome of the trial in this case, I feel regret. However, this matter will never deprive me of the freedom to carry out my loyalty in the future." After the Finance Minister finished speaking, the members of the Minseito Party applauded thunderously, and the cabinet members were also deeply moved. The assembly became silent.

However, Prince Paul consistently refused, saying that if this method were adopted, it would likely cause disturbances in South Slavic countries, and firmly insisted that the League of Nations clearly define Hungary's responsibility.

<p>Northwest Inspection Notes Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<h3>From Anxi to Baitunzi</h3>
<p>On the morning of October 5, the camel driver came to pick up the luggage to prepare the camel cart. Xie Dousheng, the Magistrate of Anxi County, hosted a farewell banquet, inviting Fan Yuancen, Zhang Shengwei, Luo Zhenzhong and other gentlemen to accompany him. During the conversation, he learned that hundreds of miles west of the county seat, there is a place called Little West Lake. The soil is fertile, and the springs are abundant. The farmers live far away from the city, go to sow in the spring, and return in a few days. They do not apply fertilizer or weed. They only go to harvest in the autumn. The yield is mostly more than 60%. If it is cultivated further, thousands of acres of good land can be obtained. Furthermore, the Mazong Mountain, two or three hundred miles north of the city, has a vast area and lush water and grass, which can graze 100,000 camels. It is indeed a large natural pasture. Seeing its desolation is extremely regrettable.</p>
<p>He left the city at noon and walked to the camel farm, where he saw the tent set up. The outside was</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>foreign cloth, and the inside was lined with white felt, which was impermeable to wind and frost, making it very suitable for winter use. The camel farm was on the bank of the Sulai River. No drop of spring water could be seen in the river. After walking four or five miles, he suddenly saw the stream flowing gurgling, and the more it flowed, the more it became. It was thought to be the emergence of an underground stream. The river came from 湭泉 (Suzhou) and flowed west to Dunhuang, converging with the Dang River and entering Zhu Hala Naor. In the summer and autumn seasons, the entire river dries up due to irrigation. It gradually flows smoothly only in winter, but it is quickly frozen. On the way, he turned northwest and passed the Dragon King Temple (ten miles from the city and fifteen miles from the camel farm east of the city). The temple had five courtyards and nine halls. The wind chimes clanged, and the tiles were bright and shiny. The city's architecture was not as magnificent. The road was a hard Gobi Desert, wide and flat, where two or three cars could travel side by side. Fifty miles to Shiyaozi, six or seven sand dunes surrounded two or three dilapidated walls. It used to be a waist station, but due to lack of water and grass, it is now uninhabited. It was late, so he set up a tent and stayed overnight. At dawn on the 6th, he set off on an empty stomach. Sand dunes undulated, and the ground was paved with black stones. Bitter beans (two or three feet high, with branches and leaves like locust trees, butterfly-shaped purple flowers, and pods clustered, curled up like a lazy dressing), white thorns, several zhang in a clump, thirty miles to Baitunzi, with water and grass. He stopped to let the camels graze. Baitunzi is the first post station from Anxi to Xinjiang. Fifteen years ago, there were more than 20 households. Now there are only two, making a living by opening shops. The desolation is indescribable. On the high ground north of the village, there is a spring gushing from the cracks in the rocks, which can be used for irrigation after long-term storage. The stream flows eastward through the village and then disappears into the sand. The village has about 70 acres of land, exempt from grain tax, which can be cultivated at will, in order to persuade the remaining two families not to continue to escape. The gun tower and smoke mound have all decayed. An ancient temple was built next to it, but it is empty. Only the four walls are full of poems, which are quite beautiful. One of them says, "The ancient temple of Baitun is on the top of the mountain, how many years have the evening drums and morning bells been ringing? The slanting sun hangs upside down, the shadow of the pavilion and pagoda, the light wind sweeps across the smoke. The spring passes through the stone rocks and it is difficult to stay, the peaks emerge from the clouds, broken and connected again. Passing travelers frequently visit, and I will chat here as a wandering immortal." I don't know who wrote it. The house is leaking and raining, the beams are stained with pigeon droppings, and the handwriting is blurry. Although it is possible to get a glimpse of the emotions of the soldiers, it is difficult to get a glimpse of the whole picture of the masterpiece, which is a pity.</p>
<p>He spent the night in a tent, burning camel dung, cooking noodles, chatting around the stove, and sleeping on the sand, which was exactly the same as when he rode a camel from Baotou to Ningxia. The only difference was that there were uninvited Mongolian guests who often came to the tent to say hello. Now, he was traveling with the Xinjiang turban (believing in Islam, they like to call each other Azizi, which is as common as the word "Sir" in the mainland. Women wear white scarves, dressed like Indians, and are one of the Xinjiang ethnic groups). The merchant Ashim was from Yutian, Xinjiang. He entered the port to do business and stayed in Jiuquan for nine years without being able to return. He had more than 80 camels on this trip, all of which were his sole property. He heard that he had five or six hundred thousand properties in his hometown. He hired eight camel drivers, half Han and half turban. He could speak Chinese, and although he was rich as a "shopkeeper," he could share weal and woe with the camel drivers. He called the Han camel drivers "Big Brother So-and-so" and the turban camel drivers "Ahong So-and-so." Ahong, in the mainland, refers to the leader of the mosque, but in turban it is more common. Children under the age of ten are called "Balangzi," meaning "child" or "baby." Otherwise, they can all be called Ahong. Each driver's monthly salary is two yuan, and they are all happy to work. In addition to the entrustment, the passengers include Mr. Su Yunxiang. Mr. Su is a "scholar of textual research" (see his business card). He started from Beiping and walked to Gansu. His destination was also Xinjiang. He met in Anxi and hired camels to travel together. However, the turban merchant believed in Islam, so it was inconvenient to eat separately. He specially prepared live sheep and asked Ahong to kill them and share the meal together. (Muslims usually ask Ahong to slaughter animals, recite scriptures, and slaughter them. If Han people invite Muslims to eat, they must also ask a Muslim chef to cook and kill them.) Ashim took care of them personally every day, from getting up to sleeping to meals. Fortunately, there was less wind and dust on this Gobi expedition.</p>
<p>The turban custom is to serve guests with "roast mutton," "roasted whole lamb," and "hand-grabbed rice." Roast mutton is to cut the mutton into slices, put it on a fire fork, and roast it over the fire, eating it while roasting. Most of it is not fully cooked. For hand-grabbed rice, first pour oil into the pot, and after it is refined, dip your hand in salt water and sprinkle it in frequently, making a loud noise, often causing a fire (that is, the oil tin ignites). Then pour half a catty or four taels of meat chunks and ribs into the pot and stir-fry. Then, put the soaked wet rice on top, tightly cover it with cloth, and move it in time to ripen. Serve the meat into two or three wooden basins, gather together, and eat it with your hands. After the meat and rice are finished, knock on the bones and suck the marrow, feeling quite</p>
<p>complacent. Today, he only traveled a short distance, and there was plenty of time for dinner. Ashim deliberately prepared roast meat and hand-grabbed rice. The rice was fragrant and delicious, but the meat stuck in his teeth. As for roasted whole lamb, he did not know whether it was the same as the roasting method in the mainland.</p>
<p>After the meal, he learned some conversational turban from Ashim. He first stated that he could recite the Quran in Arabic and also recite the Three Character Classic in Chinese. Then he recited the Three Character Classic aloud, saying, "The first person's hook (the first character was misread, or could not be read, same below), the nature is Pishan, the nature is close to each other, the nature is abyss, you can not teach, the nature is cavity one," Although the pronunciation was slightly wrong, it seemed that he was quite interested in it. Then he added, "(Zeng Xin) General set up a school, we all mistakenly thought that going to school was to be an errand. Rich people hired poor people to study. At that time, Zhou, the magistrate of Yutian, also set up a school. Our father was the leader and did not hire anyone to study. He first called my eldest brother to study, but his tongue was stiff and he could not read. Then he changed me to study. A year later, the Daotai came to test, and more than 30 students were selected, five were selected. The Daotai wanted to take them to teach again. I hurriedly sent a post, inviting the local leaders to eat, and asked them to say that I died of illness. There was also one who drank saltpeter water and had a lot of diarrhea and did not go. The other three were originally hired to read, so they had to go crying. Everyone said there was no hope. Who knew that after graduation, one became the county magistrate, and two went back to Yutian to be section chiefs. Until I went out, the county magistrate had been changed several times, but they had not been changed. It was my life that I had no official to do, so I went to do business at the entrance. I didn't know a single word, and I didn't know what reason was. Please don't laugh at us, sir, hahahaha." Observing this evening's conversation, I know that the lack of education in Xinjiang is not without a solution.</p>
<h3>Japanese Goods Evade Taxes and Are Imported Into North China in Large Quantities</h3>
<h3>Within a Week, Customs Has Discovered Three Instances of Confiscation at the Great Wall Cards, Reaching Under 200,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Tianjin Communication After the establishment of cards at the Great Wall to collect taxes on goods transported from Pseudo-State, it is extremely inconvenient for Japanese goods to evade taxes and dump them in North China. However, the Great Wall spans hundreds of miles, and it is difficult for the tax card to take care of smuggling, and the doors are open, allowing Japanese goods to flow in freely. Moreover, the coastline of Hebei Province, from Yuguan to Tanggu, is extremely long and winding, and goods can be smuggled ashore everywhere. In the last half month, the smuggling of Japanese goods into the country, which has been discovered by customs, is about three major cases. The Tanggu Customs received a report from a sea patrol boat on the morning of the 27th, saying that private goods had arrived at Tanggu Station and were loaded into armored vehicles. Therefore, the customs immediately notified the military and police agencies to prepare in unity. At 4:30 PM that afternoon, two armored vehicles drove in. The flag was not lowered outside the station, so they had to stop. The military and police guarding the area swarmed up and searched 24 large hemp bags of cigarette paper in the car, each bag containing about 30 plates, all of which were Japanese goods, imported into North China for use by cigarette factories to roll cigarettes. Each plate was sold for 24 yuan. There were also seven large packages of rayon worth about 20,000 yuan. Customs verified that the goods all came from Dalian, but there were no Japanese on the car, only one guard and two drivers, who were sent to the Gendarmerie Headquarters and transferred to Tianjin for interrogation on the 28th. The discovery of this matter is quite related to the military reputation of the armored vehicle team. The captain of the team has stated to the Gendarmerie that he was not involved in the matter beforehand, and that it was a secret transportation by Japanese merchants and vehicle guards. Whether the truth is so simple is still unknown. The second case was on the 24th of this month, when a Japanese cargo ship suddenly appeared at the Nanhai Estuary of Shanhaiguan, fully loaded with sugar, rayon, toys, foreign cloth, etc., with a total value of more than 300,000. After being discovered by customs, they planned to detain it. The Japanese shipowner notified the Japanese Gendarmerie in Shanhaiguan and sent a sergeant and two soldiers to stop it, saying that the goods on the ship were all for military use and were exempt from customs duties according to regulations. The customs personnel argued, but to no avail. They had to send people to monitor where the goods were unloaded, while the other side telegraphed the Tianjin Customs for consultation. On that day, the Japanese Gendarmerie used dozens of cargo trucks to transport the ship's goods to Qinhuangdao. The customs monitoring personnel were unable to stop them, and only watched them transport them. The third case was on the 24th of this month, when the Shihe Zhen tax card between Yuguan and Qinhuangdao seized 12 cars carrying smuggled goods, which were opened from Tianjin. The cars were loaded with hemp yarn, cloth, woolen fabrics, etc. It was found that the goods were transported by a Japanese merchant transfer company from a certain foreign firm on Fukushima Street in the Japanese Concession of Tianjin and transferred to a certain traitorous merchant in Yuguan for resale. They were detained, and the goods have been transported to Tianjin. In addition, the five newly established cards on the Great Wall have intercepted smuggled goods worth 200,000 yuan in the past few months, but those who are detained are detained, and those who smuggle have not stopped.

<p>All of Jiangxi Is Divided Into Twelve Pacification Zones</p>
<h3>Gu Zhutong Establishes Pacification Headquarters and Security Department to Implement Conscription System on a Trial Basis</h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication The main force of the Red Bandits in Jiangxi has all fled to Hunan, and all the counties that were captured by the bandits have been completely recovered. In the future, it is only necessary to suppress and appease at the same time, eliminate small groups of bandits in various places, and arm the people so that they can defend themselves. Therefore, when Chairman Jiang left Nanchang for Beijing, he summoned Gu Zhutong to discuss ending the encirclement and suppression of five provinces and proceeding with pacification measures. After the Central Government issued an order to abolish the commanders-in-chief of various routes and appoint Gu as the Pacification Director of Jiangxi, Gu has ended the Northern Route Headquarters and is preparing to establish a Pacification Headquarters in Ji'an, because Ji'an is located in the middle of the Gan River, the center of southern, western, and eastern Jiangxi, which is very convenient for command. In order to eliminate all bandit areas within a time limit to avoid mutual excuses, the entire province is divided into twelve pacification zones. A bandit suppression commander is set up in each zone, with Zhao Guantao, Chen Cheng, Mao Bingwen, Sun Lianzhong, Zhang Fang, Luo Zhuoying, Tan Daoyuan, Wu Qiwai, etc. serving as district commanders, responsible for suppressing scattered bandits, supervising rehabilitation, organizing Baojia, training the masses, and all rehabilitation responsibilities in their respective districts. The Security Department decided to implement the conscription system on a trial basis in order to arm the people so that they can defend themselves. Detailed measures will be drafted soon. In order to make the people understand the purpose of holding weapons to defend society, the Provincial Government has printed a large number of conscription propaganda outlines and distributed them to various counties for wide publicity. The circular stated that the conscription in various counties has begun and is urgent, and should be implemented uniformly throughout the province to facilitate implementation. From this, it can be seen that the system of oppression and recruitment has</p>
<p>entered the stage of conscription. (October 28)</p>
<p>Jinpu Railway Holds Full-Line Police Inspection</p>
<h3>Location at Xuzhou and Tianjin</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Jinpu Railway Bureau, in order to rectify police affairs, specially held a grand review of the entire railway police and security team. The location was originally set at Qin'an, but due to the excessive length of the entire route, assembly was inconvenient. Therefore, it was decided to gather separately in Xuzhou and Tianjin. The police and security teams from Pukou to Gushan, as well as the Wuyi Police Training Institute, were gathered in Xuzhou. They began arriving in Xuzhou successively in the latter half of this month and camped in the area south of the airfield. Qiu Wei, the director of the railway management committee, accompanied by Gong Bailing and Chen Wenming, a specially appointed military science professor from the Central Military Academy, served as the chief judges, along with representatives from various sections of the railway. On the morning of the 29th, at 6:00 AM, they arrived in Xuzhou by train from Pukou. After disembarking, they were led to the airfield by Zhang Xiaochun, the chief host. At that time, the police teams had already assembled on the field, totaling one regiment, divided into three battalions and eight companies. Ren Wenhai, the commander of the first patrol battalion stationed in Pukou, served as the regimental commander. Deng Xixian, the chief of the third police section stationed in Bengbu, served as the first battalion commander. Zhao Binglin, the chief of the tenth police section stationed in Tai'an, served as the second battalion commander. Qiu Ji'an, the commander of the third company of the first patrol battalion stationed in Pukou, served as the third battalion commander. Companies one and two were drawn from the Puli section police, companies three and four were drawn from the Chao Gushan section police, companies five and six were drawn from the Wuyi Police Training Institute, company seven was drawn from the first patrol battalion, and the machine gun company was a combined unit. After Qiu and others arrived at the field, they immediately conducted the review. Gao Li'an, the police commissioner, directed everything. First, a military parade was held, with Qiu and others inspecting the formation. Then, each battalion and company circled the field once, with orderly steps. Following this were standardized drills, combat drills, martial arts, and wrestling, all of which were highly skilled and impressive. At noon, they had a picnic at the airfield. In the afternoon, there was a field exercise, a regimental confrontation. One side acted as the imaginary enemy, and the other side as the attacking force. The imaginary enemy of two regiments occupied Camel Mountain to the east of the airfield and the area to the east of the railway. The attacking force set out from Xia Ding and advanced to Tiecha Temple via Baiyun Mountain and Xiang Mountain, advancing in three column formations, with three river advancement lines. Finally, they engaged in an encounter battle on the Hong, Camel Village, and airfield line, and then seized the enemy's position. During the battle, Qiu and others followed the army forward. During shooting, the bullets were removed from the cartridges and replaced with firecrackers. The exercise concluded in the evening. Qiu then gathered everyone for a speech, and Chen and Gao also offered criticism. Wang Jun hosted a banquet for Qiu and others at a food store that evening. Qiu and his entourage then boarded a night train north to inspect the Tianjin police team. According to Qiu, this was the first centralized review on this railway. In the future, it is planned to conduct one or two centralized reviews each year to improve the skills of the police officers so that they can truly fulfill their responsibility to maintain transportation. As for the railway's undertakings, such as the construction of various branch lines and facilitating the transport of mining areas, they are all under construction. The business situation is also showing a profit every month, which will be used to develop the railway's operations. (November 30th)</p>

<h3>### National Tax Universally Reduced, Government Approves Retention</h3>
<p>Some of the paddy fields in the counties' districts have suffered from drought and poor harvests. Previously, a provincial order was received to investigate and report wasteland, with instructions issued to all districts. The county sent personnel for a preliminary survey, followed by a review by the provincial committee, and convened a meeting of district chiefs from each district to determine the grades of wasteland. It was decided that the first to fifth districts would receive a universal reduction of 20%, the sixth and seventh districts would not receive a reduction, and the eighth district, due to its proximity to the coast, would receive a universal reduction of 60%. The resolution was submitted to the provincial government for approval on file. Currently, the first installment of the national tax has already been collected, and the amount to be universally reduced can be calculated and deducted from the regular tax. However, the amount of the land surtax is small and difficult to deduct. The county government reported the situation to the provincial government for instructions. An order was received stating that the amount of the universal reduction would be allowed to be deducted from the second installment of this year's national tax, and the land surtax would be allowed to be retained for deduction next year.</p>

<h3>### County Public Security Bureau Chief Transferred</h3>
<p>Wang Bolin, the chief of the Wuxian Public Security Bureau, has served for several months. Recently, due to repeated theft cases in the urban and suburban areas, the handling of affairs has been difficult, and his attitude has been passive. He submitted a request to resign, which was approved by the provincial government yesterday, and he was transferred to the province. Zhang Hanwei, the current police inspector of the Department of Civil Affairs, has been appointed to succeed him. Wang Bolin has already instructed his department to expedite the handover, and he will soon leave Suzhou. Cheng Anshi, the chief of the Second Section, has been specially appointed to temporarily act in his place. At the same time, Inspector Zhang Dichchen, Zhang Xikang, the chief of the First Section, and the chief of accounting have all submitted their resignations. Zhang Hanwei, the new chief, is scheduled to arrive in Suzhou on the 4th and take office on the morning of the 5th.</p>
<h3>### Strive for This Year's Autumn Land Survey Assessment</h3>
<p>The autumn land survey assessment for Wuxian was previously determined by the prefectural government to be 63.5%, which was submitted to the provincial government for review. An order was received rejecting it. The Wuxian magistrate convened a meeting of the owners of various land trading firms yesterday, and the result was to resubmit it to the Department of Finance for review at 64%. It is said that the Department of Finance requires the autumn land survey assessment for Wuxian to be at least 68%, so the difference of 4% may be difficult to resolve for the time being.</p>

<p>Zhang Penghao, Chen Xie Nan, Guo Hen Jie, representatives of the Nanyang Dutch General Branch, He Xuanmin, representative of the British Malaya Zhang Branch, and other overseas representatives Wu Weikang, Jiang Zhulin, etc., who originally intended to go to Beijing to attend the Fifth National Congress, took the opportunity to travel inland for inspection in order to prepare for investing in their homeland, since the congress had been postponed. The day before yesterday at around 8 PM, Zhang and others, accompanied by Xu Yuanquan, the commander-in-chief of the Sixth Route Army, Gong Chuwu, the deputy director of the Beijing Office of the Sixteenth Route Army Headquarters, etc., arrived in Wuxi from Zhenjiang and stayed at the Wuxi Hotel. Yesterday, they visited scenic spots such as Li Garden, Plum Garden, and Turtle Head Isle. They left Wuxi for Suzhou that evening.</p>
<h3>### Land Price Declaration Postponed Again</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government is conducting urban land price declarations in this county. Due to the opposition of local people, progress has been slow. It was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of October, but County Magistrate Yan obtained approval from the provincial government to extend the deadline to the end of November. Now, the deadline has been extended again. Although many have declared on time, there are still those who are waiting and seeing and have not yet declared. Therefore, the land price declaration office issued a notice yesterday to extend the deadline by another fifteen days, until December 15th. At the same time, the county government instructed the secretaries of each district to bring maps and registers to assist business owners in checking acreage, boundaries, and silver tax amounts, and ordered the Public Security Bureau to send police to assist and order the map warden to beat the gong along the streets to urge declarations, which must be completed by the deadline.</p>
<h3>### Two Rural Women Run Over by Train</h3>
<p>Zhu Shen, a rural woman (19 years old) from Xiaoxu Lane, figure 345, Beidu Township, eighth district, and Jiang Zhou, an old woman (58 years old) from the same village, went to the market to buy vegetables on the morning of the day before yesterday. At around 10 AM, they were returning to the village from the market. When they passed the 132nd railway bridge at 108 kilometers of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway at Wangting Station, they were run over by the first express train from Shanghai to Nanjing. The two rural women were unable to avoid it and were crushed to death, their flesh and blood blurred, a tragic sight. Yesterday (the 1st), Li Yongfa, the warden of the figure, reported it to the local branch court and requested an autopsy. After the acting prosecutor opened the court for inquiry, he ordered them to be sent back to prepare the mortuary.</p>
<p>It has been decided that the coroner will be taken to the village today to conduct an autopsy.</p>

<h3>### Business Corps Captures Major Robbery Suspects</h3>
<p>Yang Jinchuan and Tang Shenggeng, two major suspects in the Bao Renjia robbery case in Panjiaqiao section of the eighth district of Wuyi, were previously captured by the Zoumatang Defense Corps and sent to the Nanzhai Eighth District Office. They then escaped at night, taking advantage of the corps members' lax defense. County Magistrate Hou was furious upon receiving the report and placed Wang Qing Tong, the chief of the eighth district, under surveillance for about a week before the chiefs of each district jointly submitted a request for bail. Recently, one of the suspects, Yang Jinchuan, was still secretly active in the area west of the city, and was captured on the 29th by members of the sixth branch of the Business Corps, accompanied by informants, and sent to headquarters. The suspect initially denied it, changing his name to Zhu Rongsheng. However, after being identified by Zhou Yiwen, a member of the detective team, he confessed. He was sent to the county for interrogation on the evening of the 30th. It is said that he has confessed to various crimes he committed. The victims will need to be summoned for questioning in the coming days.</p>

<h3>### Petition to Provincial Government to Reduce Land Tax</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Civil, Financial, and Construction Departments sent personnel to conduct an on-site survey of the autumn land survey assessment in this county. Due to the severity of the disaster, the county government planned to submit a request to the provincial government for approval at 87%. The provincial departments ordered that it could not be approved, and the Department of Finance determined that the county would collect at 52%. After receiving the order, the county government convened a meeting of local organizations on the 19th of last month, and decided to maintain the original proposal and requested that wasteland be eliminated and ripe land be taxed according to the Wujin method, and submitted it to the province for review. He Peixuan, Gu Haojia, and Chen Xingjie were appointed to go to the province on the 2nd to petition the Department of Finance.</p>

<h3>### Officials and Gentry Rebuild Wanfu Bridge</h3>
<p>Wanfu Bridge in the eastern township of this county was destroyed by Sun Chuanfang's defeated army in 1927 and has not been repaired since. Last year, Li Zhijing, a merchant from Zhejiang, passed by this bridge and, unable to bear the danger of travelers crossing the rapid current by small boat, made a vow to promote fundraising in Shanghai for the construction and repair. Local people saw that Li, a foreigner, still had this enthusiasm, how could they continue to ignore the opportunity? Therefore, elders such as Zhu Zhuxuan initiated preparations and served as Li's support. They also received strong support from Wang and Yu, two members of the Central Committee, and Han Zhishi, a gentry from Taizhou, hoping to receive subsidies from the provincial funds. Director Shen of the Department of Construction also paid close attention to this. He sent a letter to the Canal Engineering Bureau asking them to send personnel to design the preliminary project. Sun Zhizheng and Shou Pei of the bureau conducted a detailed survey and careful planning, estimating that the supply and transportation of materials and the construction costs would total 196,163 yuan, or more than 430 yuan per meter of bridge length.</p>

<h3>### Letter from the Changlu Salt Affairs Audit Office</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern: I recently read in the Tianjin Telegraph section of your newspaper on the 23rd of this month that there was a conflict between the Changlu salt farmers and local villagers. According to Zhang Zhongli, the director of the Changlu Tax Police Bureau, who accompanied the brigade on its departure, it has been verified that they were greeted with enthusiasm everywhere. They arrived safely at Longping from Baixiang the day before yesterday, one or two hundred li from Jize and Pingxiang. The Eight District Patrol Team is also in Longping, and the entire district is peaceful. According to this telegram, the brigade only arrived in Longping the day before yesterday (the 23rd), and Jize and Pingxiang are both south of Longping and still far away. The brigade has not yet gone there, so how could there be a conflict? It is clear that your newspaper's Tianjin Telegraph is based on inaccurate rumors. I request a correction. Sincerely, Changlu Salt Affairs Audit Office of the National Government Ministry of Finance. November 27th.</p>

<p>Expressing Gratitude for the Comfort Offered to the Soldiers</p>
<p>Wishing to Exert Sincere Efforts to Wash Away the Communist Banditry</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union received a reply telegram from Chiang Kai-shek yesterday, which read: "To the Shanghai General Labor Union, greetings. I have received your gracious telegram. Ruijin has long been occupied by the Red bandits, and the local area has suffered greatly. Now, fortunately, the soldiers have used their lives to completely destroy the bandit dens. Thinking of the wounds and suffering, I am filled with sorrow. I am deeply grateful for your distant comfort. I wish to exert sincere efforts to wash away the Communist banditry as soon as possible. The future of the nation truly depends on this. Chiang Kai-shek (Seal)".</p>
<p>The General Directorate of the Emergency Relief Donation Association Established Its Office Yesterday</p>
<h3>Sichuan Road YMCA Officially Begins Operations</h3>
<p>After joint initiation by the city's party and government organs and various organizations, and the launch of the city-wide general donation campaign for disaster relief across the country, a meeting was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the afternoon of the 30th to establish the Shanghai General Donation Committee for Disaster Relief. It was decided to establish a general affairs department. The general affairs department of the Shanghai General Donation Committee for Disaster Relief officially established its office yesterday afternoon at the Sichuan Road YMCA and began operations. All publicity and general donation plans will be handled by the general affairs department. The general affairs department is scheduled to expand publicity before the 7th of this month and implement universal fundraising starting on the 8th. Mayor Wu is very enthusiastic about the universal fundraising campaign and personally wrote a "Proclamation to the Citizens on Universal Donation for Urgent Disaster Relief." The general affairs department has also formulated a publicity outline and slogans for the general donation campaign, which have been distributed to printing companies and bookstores for printing and distribution to various streets, roads, and shop entrances. Simultaneously, the Bureau of Education is liaising with major theaters to screen publicity slogans and advertisements to promote the campaign. The Mayor Wu's "Proclamation to the Citizens" and the publicity outline and slogans are recorded below:</p>
<p>Proclamation to the Citizens Mayor Wu's Proclamation to the Citizens on Universal Donation for Urgent Disaster Relief states: Our country has suffered frequent disasters throughout the years. This year, a severe drought has ravaged the country. The disaster area covers eleven provinces and three hundred and sixty-nine counties. The extent of the disaster area and the number of affected people are unprecedented. The people in the bandit areas are living in especially dire circumstances. According to a telegram from Chairman Chiang, the bandit areas of the three provinces are like impoverished borderlands, with everything plundered, desolate, with no houses left unburned, no trees left unfelled, no chickens or dogs left alive, and no oxen left unkilled. Only the sound of weeping can be heard, and no cooking smoke can be seen. In some cases, tens of thousands of people, with their heads covered in mud, kneel before the army, their faces gaunt and bodies emaciated, lying stiffly on the roadside. The惨 state is unprecedented. Now that autumn is ending and winter is approaching, looking at those impoverished people, wandering and displaced, suffering from hunger and cold, enduring death and awaiting rescue, everyone has a sense of compassion. Putting ourselves in their shoes, can we not feel sorrow? Although Shanghai is the wealthiest region in the country, in recent years, due to the global economic panic abroad and the decline of the rural economy at home, the great powers have intensified their economic aggression, and the people have gradually lost their purchasing power. The prosperity of Shanghai in the past is like the setting sun. As the saying goes, "Be mindful of danger in times of peace." Since ancient times, great disasters have always been followed by great chaos. In this time of concurrent disasters and danger, all of us citizens should remember this historical lesson and bravely shoulder our social responsibility. Moreover, the foundation of Shanghai's prosperity is linked to the safety of the people's livelihood in the inland. If we only seek temporary enjoyment, only pursue our own comfort, indulging in extravagance and neglecting assistance, and only pursuing luxury and neglecting the people's suffering, then the catastrophe of the collapse of the entire nation will soon be seen in the near future. This is not an oversensitive speculation, but a certain consequence. This mayor is deeply concerned about this, especially because the disaster area is vast and the number of affected people is large. Only through concerted donations and collective efforts can we overcome the difficulties and provide disaster relief. The amount of donations is not important, but rather that everyone does their best. Every little bit helps. I hope everyone will contribute. Then, the day of recovery in the disaster area will be the time of prosperity for Shanghai. Saving people from drowning is like saving oneself. Saving people is saving oneself. I hope that all citizens and organizations will deeply understand the significance of this and enthusiastically contribute to this righteous cause. Saving the disaster victims will benefit the country and society. November 28, 1934.</p>
<p>Publicity Outline All citizens of the city and all sectors of Shanghai, starting today, are launching a great and enthusiastic universal donation campaign for disaster relief. You all care about the suffering of your compatriots and should already know about it. Recently, disasters have struck various parts of our country one after another. I don't know how many people have died unnatural deaths. Thinking of this situation, I feel infinite sadness. This year's drought, banditry, and flood disasters are particularly severe. Droughts can kill people, floods can kill people, and banditry can especially kill people. Their deaths are caused by "hunger," "drowning," and "gunfire" and are inhumane. They are our dearest compatriots. Their flesh and blood are our flesh and blood. Their suffering is our suffering. As the saying goes, "Everyone has a sense of compassion." How can we, who are fortunate enough to be alive, bear to see them on the verge of death? Compatriots, there are countless disaster victims spreading across the disaster area. They are starving and have eaten all the tree bark and grass roots. Husbands and wives, parents and children, hug each other and wait for death, crying out in agony. The foreign invasion is urgent, and the country is in turmoil. What we need is for all compatriots across the country to unite as one and focus on the path of resisting the enemy. We must not let our dearest compatriots die in disaster, which will only increase the number of deaths because this is a very serious matter. "Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda," accumulating immeasurable merit. Shanghai is the economic center of the country. Wealthy households from all over the country are concentrated in Shanghai, which is why it is so prosperous today. Disasters in various places are actually the same as disasters in Shanghai, because if the sources are cut off, there will be no prosperity. Don't you see that the companies and shops on the major roads are either shouting about big discounts and big sales, or closing down, or being sealed up? Why is that? It is because the rural areas are bankrupt and the disaster situation in various places is serious, and the economy is exhausted. Therefore, thoroughly speaking, taking some money out to help them is helping ourselves. This is truly a righteous and unavoidable act of kindness. I sincerely hope that all compatriots in the city will generously contribute to the urgent disaster relief, to maintain the impact of various disasters on our city, and to pray for the disaster victims who are on the verge of death. With great gratitude, the Office of the General Affairs Department of the Shanghai General Donation Committee for Disaster Relief.</p>
<p>Fundraising Slogans 1. Urgent disaster relief, universal fundraising. 2. Saving people is saving yourself. 3. Disaster relief is saving people. 4. Drought and bandit disasters urgently need relief. 5. Saving a life is immeasurable merit. 6. Donating one yuan saves a life. 7. Disaster relief is saving the country. 8. Disaster relief and caring for the people are the duties of everyone. 9. Universal relief for the disaster victims depends on the strength of the masses. 10. Donating to disaster relief is a great act of kindness. 11. Helping disaster-stricken compatriots is helping yourself. 12. Compatriots of the whole city, come quickly and generously contribute. 13. Providing relief to disaster victims is unavoidable. 14. The disaster victims who are starving are longing for our help. 15. Disaster relief is a national revival movement. 16. Generously contribute to save the country and the people.</p>

<p>The City's Military and Police Agencies Implemented Winter Defense by District Starting Yesterday</p>
<h3>Security Team Members Assist in Setting Up Positions</h3>
<p>The city's military and police agencies divided the city into three districts yesterday and implemented a three-month winter defense plan. The plan divides the city into the Southeast District, the Northwest District, and the General Reserve Team District. The three districts are further divided into sub-districts, with Wu Tiecheng, Yang Hu, and Lan Yundong serving as the general commanders. The commanders of each sub-district are Tan Baoshou, Chief Inspector of the Public Security Bureau; Zhang Mingqin, Chief of the Pudong Branch; Liang Fuchu, Chief of the North Station Branch; Wang Dashui, Chief of the Husi Branch; and Huang Qiguang, Chief of the City Center Branch. Other senior officers, such as Li Jing, Chief of the Ximen Branch; Guan Gong, Chief of the Sixteen Pu Branch; Gong Xikui, Chief of the Xinzha Branch; and the first and second regimental commanders of the Security Team, are responsible for assisting in maintaining command within their respective jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The Prevention Measures are Extremely Thorough The winter defense will last from yesterday to February 28 of next year, for a total of three months. The Southeast District includes Shanghai South and Pudong. The Northwest District includes Zhabei, Husi, and the City Center District. The General Reserve Team District includes Caohejing and Longhua. The General Reserve Team is stationed in important locations and will assist the Southeast and Northwest Districts in maintaining traffic arteries and areas bordering the Chinese and foreign concessions at any time. The Public Security Bureau will add double posts and increase positions in these areas. Patrol officers, detectives, and male and female inspectors will patrol separately and inspect suspicious pedestrians on various roads.

In the past, winter defense meant suspending operations, but this year, defense and operations will be carried out simultaneously, starting yesterday. The 208 new members of the team are scheduled to start classes tomorrow at the Shanghai Security Committee and will graduate in May and be assigned to serve in various districts.</p>

<h3>Finance Minister Kong Talks About Shanghai's Rich Silver Deposits</h3>
<p>Silver Deposits in Chinese and Foreign Banks Total 300 Million</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Account for 81 Percent, Foreign Merchants 19</p>
<p>Financial Measures for Sichuan Province Agreed Upon, No Public Debt Issued</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing yesterday morning to handle important matters at the Central Bank. After a brief stay in Shanghai, he will return to Nanjing to prepare for the opening of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Commission. Yesterday morning, Kong met with reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Xishou Xian Road and made a statement. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Financial Measures for Sichuan Province Already in Place</h3>
<p>According to Kong, regarding the issue of reorganizing the finances of Sichuan Province, he and Liu Xiang, Director of Post-War Affairs in Sichuan, have held several meetings in Nanjing and have now agreed on specific measures. However, these do not involve issuing public debt or so-called subsidies. Since Sichuan is a province under the central government's rule, if the province's finances are in difficulty, the central government should devise measures on its behalf.</p>
<h3>Silver Deposits in Shanghai Total 300 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Kong continued, "According to reports, the total silver deposits in Shanghai banks are 300 million yuan, of which Chinese banks account for 81 percent and foreign banks account for 19 percent. This proves that rumors of a lack of silver deposits in Shanghai are absolutely inaccurate."</p>
<h3>Rising Interest Rates on Foreign Loans Are Not Worth Paying Attention To</h3>
<p>Regarding the high interest rates on foreign loans in Shanghai, Kong stated that it was not worth paying attention to. He claimed that according to the conventions of the silver industry, the autumn and winter seasons are the time when the interior needs silver, and merchants take the opportunity to raise interest rates on foreign loans in order to profit from them. However, the general public mistakenly believes that this is due to the outflow of silver, which is actually completely unrelated to the outflow of silver. Moreover, in fact, there is absolutely no possibility of silver flowing out of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Wholesale Sale of Cigarette Stamps</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is now selling 30 million yuan worth of cigarette stamp tax tickets wholesale to the China Construction Bank Corporation at a price of 92 percent, with 8 percent as the profit for the underwriters, which is the ordinary interest rate of 8%. The China Construction Bank Corporation has already paid 27.6 million yuan to the Ministry of Finance in one lump sum. The Ministry of Finance will pay the stamp tax in twelve monthly installments of 2.5 million yuan, which will be paid off in one year.</p>
<h3>Going to the Philippine Islands to Investigate Overseas Chinese Affairs</h3>
<p>Kong continued, "Recently, there have been rumors that the Central Bank will establish branches overseas, which is not true. The Central Bank is our country's national bank, and according to international practice, the national bank of a country is absolutely not allowed to establish branches in other countries. If there is a real need for this, it can only set up a representative office. As for Xu Jianping, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, who was sent to the Philippines, it was to investigate the overseas Chinese and commercial affairs there, and there are no other tasks."</p>
<h3>Economic Commission Meeting Scheduled for Next Week</h3>
<p>The fourth session of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Commission is scheduled to be held in Nanjing next week. Kong plans to stay in Shanghai for another day or two and then go to Nanjing to prepare for the meeting.</p>

<h3>Announces Plan to Revive the Sugar Industry</h3>
<p>Feng Rui, Director of the Guangdong Department of Agriculture and Forestry, came to Shanghai on the 12th of last month to discuss bank investments and promote tax exemptions for the revival of the sugar industry. He returned to Guangdong by China National Aviation Corporation plane the day before yesterday and gave a speech to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency to announce his plan to revive the sugar industry. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Revival Plan</h3>
<p>The revival of the sugar industry must be developed as a whole. Therefore, the land in Guangdong Province that is suitable for the sugar industry should first be divided into five sugar-producing areas. The first is the Guangzhou area, including Panyu, Dongguan, Shunde, Nanhai, and the Pearl River Delta. The second is the Huiyang area, including Huiyang, Boluo, Haifeng, and Lufeng. The third is the Chaoshan area, including Chaoyang, Jieyang, Huilai, and Puning. The fourth is the Xuwen area, including Xuwen and Hai康. The fifth is the Qiongya area, including all counties. The climate and soil of the five areas are extremely suitable for the development of the sugar industry. If they can work together, the sugar industry can be revived overnight. However, due to economic, talent, transportation, and market factors, it is necessary to proceed with the most urgent first. Therefore, the first year will focus on the Guangzhou, Huiyang, and Chaoshan areas. Two sugar factories will be established in the Guangzhou area and one each in the Huiyang and Chaoshan areas. The start-up costs and temporary expenses will total more than 9.402 million yuan. It is estimated that in the first year, the sugar factories in the Guangzhou area will crush a total of 1,500 tons of sugarcane per day and produce 150 tons of sugar. The Chaoshan area can crush 500 tons of sugarcane per day and produce 60 tons of sugar. The Huiyang area will double that. In total, 3,000 tons of sugarcane will be crushed each day, yielding 360 tons of sugar, or 6,048 piculs. The net profit from the first year will be used for investment in the second year. It is estimated that about 9 million yuan will be used to establish sugar producing farms in the Qiongya and Xuwen areas in the second year, so the government will only need to raise about 3 million yuan to make it work. The net profit from the second year will be used for investment in the third phase, which will be more than enough. When the three-year plan is completed, each area will have three sugar refineries, producing about 1,000 tons of sugar per day, which should be enough to supply the country. In that case, the 300 million yuan spent on purchasing sugar each year will not be plundered by foreigners, and the direct and indirect benefits to the national economy will be immense.</p>
<h3>Airport Equipment</h3>
<p>Since the Guangdong sugar production areas were ordered to be established, the cost of purchasing new-style machinery has been too high for Guangdong Province to afford. Therefore, an agreement was reached with foreign merchants to pay in installments. It is estimated that the new factory in the Guangzhou area will purchase all of the machinery and part of the construction costs for about 1,593,770 yuan in the first year. An attached alcohol factory is valued at 200,784 yuan. All of the machinery and the alcohol factory at the Shitou Factory are valued at 1,792,400 yuan, and the construction costs are 530,025 yuan. The machinery and part of the construction costs for the Huiyang Factory are valued at 2,975,000 yuan. An attached alcohol factory is valued at 359,607 yuan. The Chaoshan Factory is the same as the new factory in the Guangzhou area. The above is estimated to be 10,450,100 yuan in Guangdong currency, to be paid in 20 installments, one installment per month. It is estimated that the payment this year will only be a small part of the total, and sugar can be produced simultaneously in early December, and the increased income will be more than enough to repay the loan. Therefore, in the Guangzhou area, 1,500 tons of sugarcane can be crushed per day and 180 tons of sugar can be produced. The other two alcohol factories can produce 15 tons of alcohol per day. All of the supervisors are foreign experts in this area.</p>
<h3>Sugarcane Raw Materials</h3>
<p>When I was ordered to go to the Philippines to inspect the sugar industry, I tried to collect 52 varieties of high-quality sugarcane, all of which are recognized as the best sugarcane seedlings in the world. After returning to China, I immediately tried to breed them and rented the Yong'an enclosure in Huangpu as a breeding ground for high-quality sugarcane, obtaining more than 400 acres of land. Also, sugarcane cultivation is most important to manage. With Hawaiian sugarcane, the current yield is only 80 to 90 piculs per acre. If the most intensive cultivation is adopted, the yield can be 160 to 170 piculs per acre. Therefore, a cultivation method demonstration was held in the field to guide the farmers. Also, Chinese sugarcane has always only used light fertilizer and does not know how to use potassium and phosphorus. Therefore, the sugarcane quality is often poor and the sugar content is reduced. Therefore, a fertilizer application demonstration was held in the field to promote this. At the same time, high-quality sugarcane seedlings were distributed to farmers to promote them. Also, in order to help the rural areas and replenish the raw sugarcane for the area, a loan system was established for planting sugarcane. Farmers who plant sugarcane but lack capital can borrow funds from each sugar production area at a monthly interest rate of 8 percent. In the future, the sugarcane harvest will be sold to the sugar production area, with 9 cents per picul for wooden sugarcane and 7 cents per picul for bamboo sugarcane. Therefore, it is also known as pre-booked sugarcane planting, and sugarcane is drought-resistant and has the best harvest. Each acre of wooden sugarcane can harvest 100 piculs, valued at 90 yuan, and can earn 100 yuan including the sugarcane seedlings. The high profit and secure investment are rare among crops.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Promotion</h3>
<p>In mid-November of this year, both the Guang and Hui districts' sugar factories simultaneously began processing, producing 300 tons of sugar daily, amounting to 150,000 dan per month. Considering the Guangzhou market, it's impossible to sell such a huge quantity of sugar within a short time. Moreover, the sugar factories rely solely on cash payments to farmers for sugarcane. Therefore, the sales problem has a significant impact on both the sugar factories and the farmers. For a comprehensive solution, it is fitting to transport 400,000 dan to Shanghai for promotion. Shanghai sugar merchants also believe that the establishment of sugar factories in Guangdong province marks a new era for China's sugar industry. They previously sent personnel to Guangdong to conduct detailed investigations, deeming the equipment complete. To protect domestic industry and relieve rural areas, they are happy to support and promote the transportation of domestic sugarcane sugar to Shanghai. In the future, if domestic sugarcane sugar can be promoted to various ports, its impact on the feelings of the Chinese people will be enormous. Therefore, they are exceptionally enthusiastic about cooperating with sugar factories in Guangdong province.</p>
<h3>After the Tax Increase</h3>
<p>In 1922, the central government, considering the needs of the environment, increased the import tax on foreign sugar, laying the foundation for the revival of China's sugar industry, which was a perfect measure. However, Guangdong province, due to financial disputes, has suffered from rampant smuggling over the years, which has not helped the revival of our Cantonese sugar industry. According to the Guangzhou Customs statistics for 1933, after the tax increase, the import quantity of foreign sugar was only 14,287 dan. In the report for 1930, before the tax increase, the figure was 785,936 dan. The ratio is almost 1 to 55. This doesn't mean that the import of foreign sugar has sharply decreased after the tax increase, but rather that smugglers are engaging in illicit transportation. According to Hong Kong's export statistics for 1933, approximately 600,000 dan of white sugar were transported to Macau, and approximately 300,000 dan were transported to Guangzhou Bay. Considering Macau's imports, annual sales of 100,000 dan already seem excessive, and it is clear that the rest is being smuggled into the interior of Guangdong. Due to the terrain of Guangdong, smugglers emerge and greedy officials sacrifice themselves for profit, using all means possible. Although the government imposes severe penalties and conducts precise investigations, it still cannot remedy the situation.</p>
<h3>Control Measures</h3>
<p>The authorities in Guangdong, seeing this situation, resolutely adopted a sugar industry control policy. The operation of all businesses is centrally controlled by the government through the establishment of a promotion office. The province is divided into twelve operating areas, and ten major sugar merchants within the province are selected to manage the operation of the entire province. Below the operating merchants are distribution departments and retail stores. All provincial sugar must be stored in designated public warehouses before being transported to various places. A sales permit is required for transportation and sales; those without a permit are considered to be smuggling and will be punished according to the severity of the crime. The sugar price is determined by the promotion office, and operating merchants are not allowed to inflate the price, except for a reasonable addition for transportation costs. Therefore, although smuggled goods can be imported, they cannot be sold in the market, cutting off the path for smugglers. Furthermore, after Guangdong established its own sugar industry, it vigorously assisted customs in allocating additional fleets and large sums of money to the anti-smuggling department to increase anti-smuggling efforts. Smugglers are rampant in Guangdong province, and customs revenue from sugar taxes is extremely meager. The income from the Guangdong provincial government's control of the sugar industry is taken from the hands of smugglers, using it to supplement the customs revenue without causing any loss to customs. Moreover, since the establishment of a strict anti-smuggling organization, the number of cases involving the smuggling of other goods that have been cracked has been quite significant, and customs revenue has therefore increased. Thus, the customs authorities also benefit from the control of the sugar industry. However, although the various sugar factories were established earlier, they could only begin production at the beginning of this month due to the sugarcane raw material situation. During this lean period, purchasing raw materials and refining white sugar meet the needs of society, and all profits are turned over to the public. In recent years, Guangdong has imposed a miscellaneous tax of 3 million, much of which is derived from this, making it a good policy for the transition period.</p>
<h3>Taking the Opportunity to Return to Guangdong</h3>
<p>After Director Feng arrived in Shanghai, he contacted Chen Guangfu, manager of Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and Deputy Manager Zou Bingwen to discuss investing in the Guangdong sugar industry. It was decided that Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank would guide farmers in forming cooperatives to handle sugarcane production loans, starting with a pilot program in Panyu. He also went to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Finance for an exemption from taxes on machine-made sugar produced in Guangdong. In the early stages of the next year, the central government expressed its willingness to support the effort and reluctantly agreed. Regarding the plan to expand the production of machine-made sugarcane sugar in Guangdong, a major overseas Chinese merchant engaged in the sugar industry was also persuaded to provide assistance in terms of economic and technical personnel, so that it could proceed according to a three-year development plan. However, concerning the sales aspect, although the members of the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association are very enthusiastic and actively promoting the sugar, certain problems have not been resolved. But since the sugar factory will soon start operating, Director Feng took a China National Aviation Corporation flight back to Guangdong this morning.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Initiates Participation in the Philippine Carnival</p>
<h3>Calling on Leaders from All Walks of Life to Actively Prepare for the Promotion of Domestic Goods to Revive Overseas Chinese Businesses</h3>
<p>Foreign trade with the Philippines in Southeast Asia is very important to China. The Philippines will hold a carnival in February and March of next year, and people from all over the island will gather to participate, with the number of attendees expected to reach hundreds of thousands, creating an exceptionally lively atmosphere. Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city believes that this is a good opportunity to promote domestic goods, and that the business of overseas Chinese in the Philippines has been gradually declining recently (previously accounting for 60%, now only 50%). Therefore, the commercial situation in the Philippines cannot be ignored. Thus, yesterday afternoon, he invited leaders from all walks of life in the city to the municipal government to discuss various ways to participate in the Philippine Carnival. Those who attended included Wang Xiaolai, Yu Zuoting, Pan Gongzhan, Guo Shun, Hu Xiyuan, Liu Zhanen, Wu Zhihao, Ye Hancheng, Qian Chengluo, Wang Hanqiang, Lu Xingzhuang, Chen Yiting, Chen Binghui, Li Dachao, and others. As a result of the discussions, a preparatory committee will be formed to handle this matter. Guo Shun, Hu Xiyuan, Fang Yexian, Wu Zhihao, Chen Chengxu, Wang Jiean, Wang Hanqiang, Ye Hancheng, Chen Yiting, Lu Xingzhuang, and Chen Binghui were nominated as members of the preparatory committee. The mayor appointed Guo Shun and Hu Xiyuan as conveners. In addition, a Philippine tourism group will be organized by Wang Xiaolai and Yu Zuoting, and a special publication promoting Sino-Philippine friendship will be published by Pan Gongzhan and Liu Zhanen. It is reported that the preparatory committee for the issue of domestic goods participating in the Philippines will hold its first meeting at 3 p.m. on the 3rd (Monday) at Yiyou Society on Sanma Road.</p>
<p>The whereabouts of the Taishan Steamer are Still Unknown; the Company Sends a Ship to Search</p>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Taishan steamer, which sailed from Qingdao to Shanghai, encountered a strong wind en route and its whereabouts are unknown. The company telegraphed the Hengshan steamer yesterday to search for it. The details obtained subsequently are described as follows:</p>
<p>Encountered a Strong Wind: When the Taishan steamer was loading coal in Qingdao, the company's Shengan steamer was also transporting coal in Qingdao. The Shengan sailed three and a half hours earlier than the Taishan. After sailing out of Qingdao, it encountered a strong wind en route. It initially sailed against the wind, but later changed to sailing in a circle, changing the ship's direction to sail with the wind. Therefore, the Shengan was able to sail with the wind to near the Ningbo sea area, before escaping the wind circle, and then corrected its course to sail to Shanghai, arriving at 7:30 a.m. on the 28th. The Taishan sailed out three hours after the Shengan, so it was expected to encounter a strong wind. On the 29th, Yu Qiaqing originally intended to order the Shengan steamer, which had come to Shanghai from Qingdao, to immediately go to sea and search for the whereabouts of the Taishan steamer along the coast within the Shanghai-Qingdao line. However, due to the vastness of the coast, it was difficult to find it immediately, and the Shengan was eager to unload its cargo, so it did not sail out.</p>
<p>Still No News: The Taishan steamer should have arrived in Shanghai on the 28th as usual. Even if it encountered wind and the wireless telegraph was damaged, it should have arrived in Shanghai within five days. Even if it had run aground on the beach, it would never have failed to send a message for five days. After the Shanghai Bureau telegraphed the Qingdao Sanbei branch company for inquiry, a reply telex arrived in Shanghai yesterday, stating that the Hengshan steamer had arrived, but there was still no news of the Taishan steamer.</p>
<p>Sending a Ship to Search: The company telegraphed the Qingdao branch company yesterday, instructing the Hengshan steamer to pay attention to searching along the coasts, islands, and harbors when sailing from Qingdao to Shanghai. If it was sheltering from the wind outside, it should be discovered. Even if an accident has already occurred, objects from the ship must be floating on the sea and can be seen. Even a clue can be obtained. If one or two of the crew members of the Taishan steamer can be found during the search, everything will be clearer.</p>
<p>Ship's Crew: The captain of the Taishan ship is Norwegian Heilenann. The compradore is Lu Jingtang, the first mate is Zhang Hai, 28 years old, from Longyan, Fujian, the second mate is Huang Yuanquan, 30 years old, from Nan'an, Fujian, the chief engineer is Zheng Yongqing, 39 years old, from Yin County, Zhejiang, the first assistant engineer is Lou Longhua, 26 years old, from Yin County, Zhejiang, the second assistant engineer is Sun Wanqing, 28 years old, from Cixi, Zhejiang. The crew includes six sailors, one sailor foreman, nine stokers, one stoker foreman, two oilers, and two carpenters. The total crew is 38 people. The ship has a gross tonnage of 2,263.35 tons and a net tonnage of 1,424.15 tons. The cargo on board is valued at approximately 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Customs Seizes Smuggled Rayon</p>
<h3>Valued at 80,000 Taels</h3>
<p>Customs recently reported that smuggled, duty-evading goods often landed at Songkou, so it ordered patrol boats to step up searches. Last Friday (the 30th) night, a gasoline boat was found to be suspicious. Customs officers ordered it to stop and found 80,000 taels of rayon on board. The boat and cargo were seized and taken to Shanghai yesterday morning for investigation.</p>
<p>Ministry of Military Affairs Issues Order Protecting the Li Religion</p>
<p>Zhang Xichen, chairman of the China National Li Religion Federation, has repeatedly received reports from the Li Religion's public offices for勸戒烟酒 in various provinces, cities, and counties that people are impersonating soldiers and causing trouble. He specially petitioned the Ministry of Military Affairs for review. Yesterday, Order No. 2377 was received, concerning a petition for protection to prevent trouble and benefit the work. The order stated that if such incidents occur in the future, local police should be asked to crack down on them at any time. After receiving the order, the Federation notified all subordinate public offices to be informed.</p>

<h3>Two Cotton Industry Organizations Petition for Exemption from Exchange Transactions</h3>
<p>The China Cotton Industry Federation and All Cotton Merchants' Guilds telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, and Rural Reconstruction Committee, stating: "To Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, and the Rural Reconstruction Committee: We, the cotton merchants' association, engage in the business of transporting and selling cotton. Business tax has already been paid on the purchase of seed cotton at the place of origin, transit tax has been paid on the purchase of cotton in Tianjin and Hankou, and import tax has been paid on the purchase of cotton from abroad. Therefore, the buying and selling of cotton by cotton merchants at the Shanghai Chinese Cotton and Cloth Exchange is merely a means of adjusting to the quantity collected at the place of origin and the suitability of sales volume. In fact, the goods delivered are all cotton on which the above taxes have already been paid, and there has never been any separate transaction tax paid. Recently, rumors have been circulating that someone has proposed to the Ministry of Finance to collect a tax on cotton trading within the exchange. This is equivalent to double taxation, which is unbearable. The cotton merchants are directly responsible, and the farmers are indirectly responsible. At a time when rural areas are bankrupt and commerce is declining, we urge you to be mindful of the people's hardship and not adopt proposals that disturb merchants and harm the people. If you are so informed, it will greatly comfort the hearts of the people." The Dahus Bank Grand Opening Yesterday</p>
<h3>Yu Zuoting Unveils the Ceremony; Over 500 Guests from All Circles</h3>
<p>The Dahu Bank of this city was originally located on Shanxi Road. Now, with the development of its business, the old location is not enough to accommodate the expansion. Therefore, a new building was built at the entrance of Xiangfen Lane on Nanjing Road. The entire decoration is made of marble, which is luxurious and magnificent, and extremely majestic. Yesterday, the bank formally moved into business, and the opening ceremony was unveiled by Yu Zuoting, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. More than 500 people from all walks of life went to congratulate, including Chen Zheqing, Xu Jilong, Xu Xinliu, Tang Naikang, Dai Gengxin, Zhang Weirupan, Pan Gongzhan, Luo Qinghua, Mao Heyuan, Wu Zhihao, Wang Xiaolai, Sun Meitang, Zhang Shenzhi, Jin Guobao, Ge Jechen, Ke Ganchen, Xu Tingzu, Pei Yunqing, Sun Renlan, Tao Baichuan, Zheng Zena, Yuan Ludeng, Hu Chunxiang, Hu Xiguo, Li Wenjie, Fang Jiaobo, Wang Wanping, Jiang Yiping, Chen Qun, Dong Yu, Zheng Chengqing, Chen Guangfu, Ye Jiaxing, Xie Keming, and others. Directors Wang Yansong, Zhu Meixian, Pan Luyan, Ye Yin San, Supervisors Jin Runxiang, Zhu Wenqi, Li Heqing, Deputy Managers Yu Guozhen, Ma Shaoquan, Wang Honglai and others personally served as hosts. Yesterday, there was a very crowded atmosphere of depositing money, and in the evening, customers were still seen crowding the bank, which was overwhelmed. According to the person in charge of the bank, all the staff members were arranging things all night the day before yesterday, and they only took a nap for a moment until dawn, and then they each performed their duties. Their quick and well-trained work gained the trust of depositors and the praise of guests.</p>
<p>Cantonese Woman Sues Sheng Yuchang for Abandonment</p>
<h3>Sheng Admits to Having Taken Her as a Concubine; Denies All Other Allegations</h3>
<p>丨Court Still Needs to Investigate丨</p>
<p>Lin Yujin, a Cantonese woman, 27 years old, formerly known as Xin Yujin, a courtesan in the Changsan neighborhood, has engaged lawyer Zhu Zhengshan to represent her and file a lawsuit with the Second Court's Criminal Division, accusing Sheng Yuchang, currently residing at No. 1 Beidang Road, the eldest grandson of Sheng Xuanhuai, a former Minister of Posts and Communications of the Qing Dynasty, from Wujin, of malicious abandonment, requesting that he be investigated according to the law, and incidentally filing a civil suit requesting that he be ordered to pay alimony of 50,000 yuan. After receiving the complaint, the court summoned the defendant for a hearing, but the defendant did not appear and the hearing was rescheduled. The plaintiff's intention and reasons for filing the suit have been reported in detail in previous newspapers. This case was scheduled for a continued hearing yesterday. The plaintiff, Lin Yujin, arrived at the court at 2 p.m. with her lawyer, and the defendant, Sheng Yuchang, also arrived on time with his lawyer, Zhang Ding. Judge Xiong Huiping opened the Second Criminal Court for trial. The defendant's lawyer submitted a defense statement and a letter of appointment in court. The defense statement stated that the defendant was residing in Shanghai in 1922 when he hosted a dinner at the Datong Restaurant in the British Concession. During the dinner, a friend introduced him to the Cantonese prostitute Lin Yujin. It was originally a social occasion. Later, because the prostitute was determined to become a respectable woman and was tired of the brothel, she pleaded for help and voluntarily offered to be a concubine. The defendant saw that her livelihood was pitiful and helped her leave the brothel, agreeing to let her live in his house as a concubine. Not long after, she asked to leave and terminate the relationship, which he also agreed to. This was around the autumn of 1924. Since then, there has been no news of her for eleven or twelve years. Her whereabouts are unknown. When she left, there was no written agreement, so how could he have forced her to sign anything, and there was no physical violence involved. Since she had no status, the defendant had no right to force her to stay and had to let her go freely. These are the true facts, with no fabrications. The original complaint stated that the plaintiff encountered him twice while working as a dancer at the Dahus Ballroom and jointly rented No. 291 Renheli, Xiahfei Road, but all of this is unfounded. The plaintiff clearly knows that she left long ago and is using this trick to collude in false testimony. As for the meeting time, he gave her 200 yuan on the spot and told her not to work as a dancer again, and he gave her 300 yuan a month for living expenses, and that he recently abandoned her and disappeared. This is also a fabrication, which will be exposed upon investigation. In addition to reserving the right to file a counterclaim for false accusation and defamation, I am providing this concise defense, requesting that the court find the defendant not guilty, and that the incidental civil suit be dismissed. After reading the statement, the judge questioned the plaintiff about the details of the case. The defendant admitted that he had previously taken the plaintiff as a concubine, but she left on her own not long after, and that there was no meeting at the ballroom or giving her money to live together again. After examining the testimonies, the court held that the case still needed to be investigated and that witnesses, such as the landlord, needed to be summoned. The court then adjourned the hearing to 9 a.m. on the 8th of this month and ordered the plaintiff, Lin Yujin, to go to the court's forensic department for a lung examination next Monday (i.e., tomorrow). Then the court was adjourned.</p>
<p>Cai Xiaobai and "Little Confused Woman" Continue Their Endless Litigation</p>
<h3>Smiling at Each Other in Person; Firmly Requesting Divorce in Court</h3>
<p>Cai Xiaobai, a lawyer from Zhuji, Zhejiang, who resides at No. 137 Maxé Altiro Road in the French Concession, previously developed a romantic relationship with Wu Xueli, the daughter of Wu Zhifen, a famous calligrapher from Changzhou, known as "Little Confused Woman." They married at the Youth Association in the early summer of last year and lived together for a year. They often quarreled and fought each other over trivial family matters. In September of this year, Cai, unable to bear living together, filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court, detailing 16 counts against the defendant and requesting a divorce. After several summonses by the court, the court concluded that the reasons stated by the plaintiff were insufficient and announced a judgment on October 30, dismissing the plaintiff's lawsuit. Wu Xueli has been living with Cai at home since the end of the last hearing on the divorce lawsuit. Cai, dissatisfied with the original judgment, filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, stating his reasons. Yesterday afternoon, the High Court summoned the appellant, Wu Xueli, who arrived at the court at 2 p.m. with her lawyers, Yao Junyu and Zhou Liangfu, and waited in the lawyers' lounge. The appellant, Cai Xiaobai, arrived at the lawyers' lounge of the Second Special District Court at 3:10 p.m., as he was appearing in court at the First Special District Court. When he saw Wu Xueli, he smiled and said to Wu, "You've put me in the dock again." Fortunately, I found out and rushed here. Wu replied, "You called yourself to say so. But although I'm here, I haven't reported in yet." Both of them had smiles on their faces when they spoke, and there was no sign of incompatibility. Then, two lawyers from the same profession, Wang Shizong and someone, strongly advised both parties to reach a settlement. The expressions of both parties were equivocal. At 3:45 p.m., Judge Fan Peien opened the investigation hearing in the Third Court. He first questioned the appellant, Cai Xiaobai. Cai replied, "This case was originally being settled out of court. I was drafting a petition in my office, intending to request a postponement of two weeks. I didn't expect to come to court today, but the appellant's side had already arrived at the court with two lawyers to report in. I was appearing in court at the First Special District Court and rushed to this court after receiving the information, otherwise I would have been tricked again." The judge ordered him to state his reasons for the appeal. Cai stated that he requested that the original judgment be overturned and that the divorce be granted, citing three reasons: unbearable living together, constant abuse, and insults to his parents. The judge then summoned the appellant, Wu Xueli, to the witness stand for questioning. Wu replied that all the points Cai raised were not true and were completely fabricated. The judge asked Cai if he could reach a settlement out of court. Cai replied that he could not. The judge then questioned both parties in detail about the reasons for the divorce, such as frequent beatings, injuries, and hiding files. Finally, he questioned Cai's clerk, Yu Shunqin. By the time the questioning was completed, it was already dusk. The judge adjourned the hearing and ordered them to wait for a scheduled rehearing.</p>
<p>The Body of the Late American Aviator Too Swee Was Autopsied and Coffined Yesterday</p>
<h3>Remains Will Be Transported to the United States to Be Handed Over to His Parents</h3>
<p>The American Evening Post reported that the American aviator Too Swee was performing aerobatic stunts in a plane at Hongqiao Airport on Wednesday (November 28) afternoon when the plane crashed and killed him instantly. This morning (the 1st), American coroner Mr. Collins announced that Mr. Too died in a flying accident. Mr. Too's remains have been coffined and will be transported to the United States on the Hoover President next Tuesday to be handed over to his parents. Yesterday, the American Consulate General's Court summoned Mr. Peel, Far East representative of Boeing Aircraft Company, who witnessed Mr. Too's crash. According to Mr. Peel, Mr. Too's performing amazing techniques had not been approved by the company. He and the company had ordered Mr. Too not to take the risk of doing amazing performances, because the company in China sold this type of aircraft only relying on its speed, he did not need other things. As for Mr. Too's intentional risk-taking in disobedience to orders, he wanted to take pictures during the performance to make a movie. Mr. Too had not taken pictures when performing in Shanghai and Nanchang before. After the testimony was completed, coroner Mr. Collins said that it is necessary to find ways to prevent risky flying in the future. According to American regulations, aviators are prohibited from doing various amazing techniques in the sky less than 3,000 feet from the ground. The local prosecutor, Mr. Watson, also said that the American pilots in China, especially the officers of the American Air Force, should abide by the American regulations on such flying in the future. Mr. Too's flying and accidental death that day were filmed by Mr. Blatter at the scene. This film will be sent to Seattle on the Yafu tomorrow to be handed over to Boeing Aircraft Factory.</p>
<p>The Automobile Drivers' Union Petitions to Protect Workers' Jobs</p>
<h3>Banning the Excessive Establishment of Automobile Schools and Preventing the Excessive Issuance of Driver's Licenses</h3>
<p>The Automobile Drivers' Union of this city petitioned the party and government authorities yesterday, stating: "According to the Shenxin newspapers of this city on the 19th of this month, automobile drivers are unemployed, and car theft endangers society. After reading it, we feel infinite pain. Our association is a group of automobile drivers in the city and has the responsibility of training and protecting workers. We are all indignant and heartbroken about these scoundrels. In order to prevent future troubles, we have to think about remedial measures. According to the investigation, there are only more than 10,000 automobiles in this city. Except for hundreds of cars driven by the owners themselves, only about 10,000 drivers are needed. According to the current investigation, there are more than 25,000 people in this category. It is self-evident that there are too many monks and too little porridge. The reason for this is that automobile schools in this city are springing up like mushrooms, operating on a commercial basis and including license examinations. The second reason is that the management authorities are excessively issuing licenses without any restrictions. Therefore, these people are driven by life and do not hesitate to reduce wages or even not ask for wages in order to obtain a job. The owners will inevitably pursue profit. The old workers are gradually dismissed or fired on various pretexts, and new workers are hired, resulting in redundancy and mutual oppression. Unemployment is increasing day by day, and they cannot make a living, and even become bandits and do all kinds of evil. Since it is related to social tranquility and the job security of workers, we dare to state the situation in detail and ask the meeting to find ways to ban the excessive establishment of automobile schools and prevent the excessive issuance of driver's licenses, so as to restrict and protect the jobs of workers and maintain social order."</p>
<p>The Refugee Shelter Began to Accept Refugees Yesterday</p>
<h3>Statistics Show Over 600 People Received, Internal Facilities Quite Comprehensive</h3>
<p>The chairman of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Association, Wang Yiting, and the vice-chairman, Huang Hanzhi, in order to relieve poor and distressed refugees, specially followed the municipal government's order to advance the establishment of two temporary winter shelters. They started to accommodate refugees from 8:00 am yesterday. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Start of Accommodation The accommodation locations of the temporary winter shelters are: 1) Chaozhou Wuyi Association Hall, behind the South Railway Station; 2) Chaozhou Huishan Villa on Xietu Road.

<h3>Xue Jiaqi Sues Guo Fenglin for Attempted Murder</h3>
<p>The lawyer Xue Jiaqi, who was ambushed and injured by thugs while passing near Xiaobeimen on Minguo Road the other day, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, lawyer Xue, whose shoulders and neck were injured, had a medical examination and applied medicine that evening and requested an injury certificate. Yesterday afternoon, he submitted a request to the local court for an examination of the injury. In his original complaint, he stated that the defendant Guo Fenglin, 35 years old, from Xuzhou, who is a pancake seller (Wang Ada in yesterday's newspaper was an alias), intentionally attempted to murder him and committed the crime of causing injury. He also said that recently, incidents of splashing feces for revenge have been common in the French Concession. It is inevitable that lawyers offend the other party when protecting the interests of one party. Now, it has become more and more serious, and they even use weapons to ambush. He requested severe punishment. The court approved the examination of the scars and waited for the Public Security Bureau to bring the defendant for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Meihua Film Company's False Accusation Case Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>The manager of Meihua Film Company, Zhu Ruifeng, was previously accused by lawyer Tang Hao of the company's "Rose Song" female lead, Pan Wenxia, of breach of trust. Later, Pan's uncle rushed to Shanghai from the capital and mediated to get Zhu Ruifeng to withdraw the lawsuit. However, there were many rumors outside, and the Shanghai tabloids exaggerated the rumors, believing that Zhu was using Pan for publicity purposes and using the court as a propaganda machine. The chief prosecutor of the First Special District Court, Jian Qing, immediately issued a summons for investigation based on the tabloids. However, the investigation result confirmed the facts, but prosecutor Zhong believed that the case should be prosecuted civilly and should not use criminal means to coerce Pan Wenxia, making it possible for Pan to be subject to criminal punishment. Therefore, based on the Judicial Administration Department's Order No. 233, he filed a public prosecution, alleging false accusation. On the afternoon of the 29th of this month, Wu Zehan issued a summons, and Zhu Ruifeng and Tang Hao reported on time. After Wu questioned in detail, the defendant's lawyers Tan Yi Gong and Shi Liang defended. Finally, lawyer Dong raised his voice and said that the criminal law allows the plaintiff to withdraw the lawsuit, which was originally intended for the parties to settle matters peacefully. However, prosecutor Zhong's filing of a public prosecution after the withdrawal of the lawsuit was meddlesome and did not reflect the original intention of the law. Furthermore, the Judicial Administration Department's order was to prevent civil lawsuits from using criminal means to coerce, and the Judicial Administration Department's order could not change the law. At that time, prosecutor Zhong stated that he had no intention of changing the law. The defendant Tang Hao argued that the prosecutor did not regard the order as law, then the crime of false accusation in law included fabricating facts and forging evidence. The defendant neither fabricated facts nor forged evidence, so false accusation could not be established at all. Judge Wu believed that the debate had ended and scheduled the verdict for yesterday afternoon. The verdict stated that the grounds for false accusation were insufficient, and Zhu Ruifeng and Tang Hao were declared not guilty. A serious suspected case of false accusation came to an end.</p>

Because of her love for money, the two soon forged an unbreakable bond and rented a house together at No. 103 Guangqi Road inside Xiaodongmen. Later, Zhang became ungrateful and abandoned his wife, Ms. Zhang, as if she was a worn-out shoe. His wife secretly investigated and found out, greatly angered, so she went to No. 103 Guangqi Road at about 12:00 in the middle of the night the other day, accompanied by her uncle Zhu Alian (employee of the Times Pharmacy) and her sister-in-law Wang Wushi and other women, directly entered Zhang's bedroom, but saw Zhang and Chen woman kissing and sleeping on the same bed. At that time, Zhang and others were also awakened from a deep dream and shocked to see it. Ms. Wang was consumed by jealousy, ordered the women she led to rush forward and drag Zhang and the woman Chen out of the quilt and beat them hard. She also smashed all the things in the room. This incident has alarmed the neighbors, and the patrol police Wang Rugang heard the news and rushed to bring Zhang Ziji, Chen Xiubao, Zhang Wangshi, Zhu Alian Wang Wushi, and the landlord Jiang Chenshi to the Yemiao Police Station under its jurisdiction, and the captain immediately questioned them one by one and ordered them to prepare documents to be handed over to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Russian Man Tears Up Court Seal, Will Be Punished for Destroying Official Documents</h3>

The civil court of the First Special District Court, after several trials, ordered the full amount to be repaid and the goods sold at auction. The amount obtained by Mr. Shan at auction was insufficient, and the execution was delayed. The plaintiff requested the court to seal the factory, which was approved. Recently, the other party, through a French lawyer, issued a letter stating that the factory was actually French-owned and requested the seal to be lifted. The day before yesterday afternoon, Chinese and Western judicial police were dispatched to lift the seal and found that the seal had been torn. It was found that Ximeinafu had done it beforehand, so he was taken to the court and transferred to the Jing'an Temple Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the Second Criminal Court and charged with contempt of court and destruction of official documents. When questioned, Ximeinafu stammered and denied it. Judge Deng Baosun ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for further investigation.</p>

<p>Public Works Bureau Vehicle Office Staff Arrested for Accepting Bribes</p>
<h3>Public Prosecution Filed on Charges of Fraud, Many Violations of Prohibitions, Trial Scheduled</h3>
<p>Huang Ruiting from Ningbo, who previously served in the Public Works Bureau Police Department as a translator, originally followed a Western police officer in a high position, specializing in investigating and prohibiting drugs. Later, he was transferred to the Vehicle Office to handle the exchange of vehicle licenses for various vehicles other than cars. After many years, he accumulated a lot of wealth and built a magnificent house at No. 2, Lane 111, Oujia Road, Hongkou, with luxurious clothing and service. Last winter, his superiors found out that Huang had taken advantage of his position to accept bribes from people who paid for licenses, which was considered dereliction of duty. The Public Works Bureau Legal Group reported it to the First Special District Court. However, Wang repeatedly failed to appear in court, and the court issued an arrest warrant to arrest him. At 1:45 pm on the 23rd of last month, detective Liu Shaokui, detective Zhang Yunhong, and Wu Hanzhang arrested him and handed him over to the court, which ordered him to be detained. It was found that the suspect had defrauded Gu Songmao, who paid for a license, four times while serving as a translator in the Vehicle Office, all on the condition that the license would be issued quickly. The first time was on April 9 last year, defrauding him of 670 yuan. The second time was on May 8, also 670 yuan. The fourth time was on January 11 this year, defrauding him of 297 yuan. The third time was still on September 10 last year, and the amount obtained was the same as the first two times. The payment location was all inside Gu's home at No. 15 Minhe Lane, Xinjiang Road. In addition, Wang also defrauded Lu Dexing, who paid for a license, of 25 yuan and Xi Jieren of 27 yuan at the vehicle inspection office on Gongping Road. In this way, he did not know how to cherish himself and committed fraud repeatedly. Yesterday morning, the suspect was escorted to the court again. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu represented the Public Works Bureau and filed a public prosecution on charges of fraud. Judge Deng Baosun questioned the defendant and said that there were many victims, and it would not be possible to investigate and clarify in a short time. He ordered a hearing on a scheduled date, and the defendant was still taken back to the police station for detention.</p>
<p>Six More Major Robbers Apprehended in Shanghai Bank Robbery Case</p>
<h3>Shao Xianglin Found to Be the Mastermind of the Robbery, Also Committed Other Robberies</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 21st of last month, at about 9:00 am, 5,200 yuan was being sent to the Haige Road Jiaotong University Savings Office of the Shanghai Bank when it was robbed en route. The Yulin Road Police Station detectives Yang Peisheng, Huang Yufu, and Ma Wenda arrested 13 major robbers, including Liu Yucai and Tan Jingen, and sent them to the First Special District Court for trial and detention. It has been recorded in this newspaper. During the recess, the Chinese and Western detectives handling the case learned that Liu Yucai's accomplices were hiding at No. 82 and No. 71 Yangzho Road. They secretly went to arrest them the day before yesterday but found nothing. Later, they learned that the major robber Shao Xianglin from Jiaxing had moved to No. 41 Mike Leike Road and rushed to that place. First, they arrested his mistress Wang Xiuzhen (from Ningbo). After a while, Shao arrived and was arrested. Soon after, his accomplice Chen Zonglai from Ningbo and the suspect Zhang Sanhe from Pudong also arrived and were arrested. Twenty-four rounds of ammunition were confiscated at Chen Zonglai's home at No. 183 Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession and taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court. Public Works Bureau lawyer Li Zhishan said that Shao Xianglin and Liu Yucai had committed many robberies in the concession, and Shao was the leader. He confessed at the police station that from March to October of this year, he had robbed the Jinzi brand on Beijing Road, a resident on Huade Road, and someone on Shandong Road Sanyang Jingqiao, and attempted to rob a bag of silver corners, a total of three cases, and fired shots to resist arrest. He had a gunshot wound on his body. There was also an accomplice named Ma Er, who had also been found but not sent to the case. Twenty-four rounds of ammunition were confiscated in the police station's pistol room. He requested detention for the defendants and interrogation with Liu Yucai. When questioned, Wang Xiuzhen said that she had been living with Shao Xianglin recently and did not know that he was a robber and asked for understanding. Shao Xianglin admitted that he had robbed the Beijing Road case and received 600 yuan, and he had fired shots to resist arrest in the Huade Road and Shandong Road cases. Liu Yucai went to Huade Road with him and also fired shots. Wang Xiuzhen was indeed his mistress, and she knew nothing about him being a robber. Chen Zonglai admitted that he had joined in all three robberies and that the bullets at his home belonged to Shao Xianglin. Shao also claimed that Ma Er also fired shots to resist arrest in the Shandong Road robbery. Zhang Sanhe also said that he had recently come to Shanghai from Pudong and was not a thief. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled to be tried together with Liu Yucai.</p>
<p>Threatened Guanghua Dye Factory Foreman, One Bandit Arrested in Pudong</p>
<h3>Detectives Disguised to Pay as Scheduled, Lin Caught in the Trap and Brought to Justice</h3>
<p>Yan Er, a 39-year-old from Tongzhou, worked as the head foreman at the Guanghua Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 172 Luban Road in the South City. He was hardworking and thrifty and was trusted by the factory manager Pu Shuhong. He had some savings, which were coveted by bandits. Yan repeatedly received threatening letters and ignored them. On the afternoon of the 26th of August this year, he was shot by bandits near the Guanghua Factory when he was faking dismissal from work. The bullet hit his right chest and he was sent to Baolong Hospital on Blake Road for treatment. It took 21 days to recover. After Yan was discharged from the hospital, in order to ensure safety, he entrusted two fellow villagers, Zhang Fuyou and a monk named Hesheng, to take 700 yuan to Suzhou to contact a bandit surnamed Gu to pay the money in an attempt to resolve the matter. Unexpectedly, on the 11th and 12th of this month, he received two more threatening letters from the "China Hero Party," demanding a large sum of money. The content of the letter roughly stated, "The brothers of this party are in financial difficulty and are asking to borrow 3,000 yuan. Please send an elderly man in his fifties wearing a white cloth on his head and holding a newspaper in his hand as a signal at the Dongchang Road Xinma Road Bridge to pay the money at 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm on the 24th of October, otherwise it will be detrimental to you," etc. Yan immediately reported the situation to Lu Ying, the captain of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Zhang Mingqin, the director of the Pudong Branch Bureau. After receiving the report, Lu ordered the deputy squad leader Li Xiaoqi and Chen Jinshan, disguised as the above-mentioned merchants, to carry a fake silver bag and go to Dongchang Road Xinma Road Bridge at 4:00 pm the day before yesterday, and led detectives Jiang Binru, Zhao Bingquan, Jin Yushan, Guo Maoqian, Hu Ruizhi, and Zhang Yanbiao to disguise themselves and ambushed them at the Dongchang Road Xinma Road Bridge. At half past five, they saw a person coming slowly, wandering by the bridge, and then going forward to ask the detective Chen Jinshan, "Friend, what are you doing here?" Chen replied, "We are waiting for a friend." The bandit asked, "Where are you from?" Chen replied, "Luban Road." The bandit asked, "Which shop?" Chen replied, "Guanghua." The bandit asked, "How many people came?" Chen replied, "One person came." The bandit asked, "What's in the bag?" Chen replied, "Clothes." The bandit said, "I already know, please give this to me, is the amount enough?" Chen replied, "The amount is enough." The bandit said, "You are very straightforward, I will guarantee you will be fine in the future." Chen Jinshan then handed the bag to him, and Li, the squad leader, led his men to rush forward bravely and hug the bandit, arresting him on the spot and confiscating the fake silver bag and two keys, eight small dollars, and a pawn ticket. He was brought back to the bureau. According to the bandit's confession, his name was Lin Xiaomei, 24 years old, from Taizhou, living behind the Shenping Building on Huayuan Stone Bridge. At 4:00 pm today, he met his friend Gu Jingui from Tongzhou, who invited him to eat meat and drink wine at a small restaurant. Jin Gui mentioned the matter, saying that the letter was written by someone Chen from Puxi, and today he accompanied him to Dongchang Road Xinma Road Bridge to take the money, and asked him to ask the merchant who looks like this if he was sent by the Guanghua Dye Factory on Luban Road, how many people came, what was in the bag, please hand it over to him, and he would guarantee him to be fine, etc. At that time, Gu went with him, and Gu stood far away. He went forward to contact him and was unexpectedly arrested. Gu Jingui took the opportunity to escape, and the rest he didn't know, etc. Then Li, the squad leader, presented the case to the branch bureau, and it was transferred to the general bureau for legal action yesterday.</p>
<p>Opium Smuggled in Parcels</p>
<h3>Is Cun Jinzhen Not Cun Zichao? Debate Ended, Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>In October of this year, the Kunming Municipal Post Office in Yunnan reported to the Haiphong Customs that it had found 4,160 grams of opium smuggled in a parcel sent by Tengchong County, Yunnan Province to Yong Shengyuan, a pawnshop in Changsha Street, French Concession, Shanghai, addressed to Cun Zichao. The Kunming Municipal Post Office, after receiving the report, forwarded it to the China Postal Administration in Shanghai for handling. The General Administration, after receiving the report, prepared a document and requested the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Court to handle it in accordance with the law. The Second Special District Court then transferred the case to the French Concession Public Works Bureau Police Department on October 26, requesting them to send detectives to investigate. On the 11th of last month, Cun Jinzhen, an employee of Yong Shengyuan, was arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court, where he was prosecuted for smuggling opium in violation of Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. After Judge Wang Gangxu opened the trial, he suspected that Cun Jinzhen and Cun Zichao were related and ordered him to be released on bail of 3,000 yuan in cash to await further investigation. Yesterday morning, it was time for the continuation of the trial. The defendant Cun Jinzhen and his defense lawyer Shen Junru appeared in court. According to Cun's confession, he was 42 years old and from Yunnan. Cun Zichao was from Tengchong County, Yunnan, and held a prominent position in the Jiangxi military. On October 19 of this year, Cun Zichao came to Shanghai from Hong Kong and resided in Taian Inn for a short time before going to Jiangxi, but he was not Cun Zichao and requested a detailed investigation. He had been doing business in Shanghai for many years and had never done anything illegal and had been wronged. At this point, the official summoned the witness Li Juntian, an employee of the Changsha shop, who testified that there was indeed a person named Cun Zichao. After the representative sent by the post office stated the case, the court ordered the debate to begin. The Public Works Bureau lawyer and the defendant's defense lawyer debated each other, and the court ordered the debate to end and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 6th. The defendant Cun Jinzhen was still released on the original bail.</p>

They are divided into six organizations, each organization using account books ranging from two or three volumes to over thirty volumes, each clearly marked with the name of the organization and the type of account book. After reading, one can understand clearly, and graduates of the training course are on hand to provide explanations. Therefore, accounting personnel who go to read can indeed increase their knowledge. It is also heard that all the account books in each group are recorded in accordance with the accounting rules and improved guidelines set by Accountant Xu, so the arrangement is orderly and quite outstanding. (2) Newly Published Account Books and Forms, which are improved Chinese account books and forms drafted by Accountant Xu and printed and distributed by the Standard Account Book and Document Manufacturing Office. This time, for the convenience of comparing with the previous practical account forms, all the recently published account books and forms are displayed together, including over thirty types of account books and over ten types of forms. There are many formats, and all industries' needs are met. The paper is divided into three types: Rodi, Haiyue, and Maobian, all of which are domestic products, and the quality is even better than those produced last year. The binding is all cloth-faced and cloth-bottom thread-bound, which is more durable. It is heard that this year's shipment adopts mass production methods, so the quantity of goods has increased, the quality is excellent, and the cost is lower. All selling prices have been uniformly reduced, which can be said to be improving bookkeeping while also promoting domestic goods. Important staff members of Xu Accounting Firm are also on hand to take care of the display area, and all inquiries from the public are answered in detail, which further increases the interest in the visit. (3) Lecture Notes and Books, which are various books and magazines published by Xu Accounting Firm, including the lecture notes and account types used in the Improved Chinese Bookkeeping Training Course, which have never been published externally. This time, they are specially bound and displayed for public viewing. There is also a book titled "Explanation of Improved Chinese Bookkeeping," which has been reprinted five times since it was published in the winter of the eleventh year and has sold tens of thousands of copies. It has recently been revised and published. In addition, the Accounting Magazine, which has published 23 issues, is a publication of Xu Accounting Firm, published once a month for two years, and can explore various accounting issues from an academic perspective. It is recognized as the only monthly magazine in the country that studies accounting issues. Among them, the theoretical basis for improving Chinese bookkeeping has also been fully developed.

<h3>Poisoning Case at the Ocaro Road Small Restaurant Referred to the Court</h3>
<p>On the 28th of last month, multiple diners at the Shunxing Small Restaurant, opened by Han Huatang and others from Haimen at No. 50 Ocaro Road in Hongkou, were poisoned and died. The matter has been reported in the newspapers three times. It is learned that among the eleven people who died from poisoning in this case, Wu Deying, a prosecutor from the Shanghai District Court, has designated Gu Koulang to transport the body to the Zhenru Autopsy Institute for autopsy. Therefore, yesterday morning, Ling Renjie, the local bailiff of the 23rd Bao 5th Tu, sent the body, along with the leftover vegetables, fish, and meat, to the Zhenru Forensic Autopsy Institute for chemical testing. The restaurant's friends, Lin Rongzeng, Li Zitang, and Li Caiyin from Haimen, Lu Caixiang from Qingpu, Yin Tianmu from Zhenjiang, and witness Lu Dexing from Wenzhou, were escorted by the Linping Road Police Station to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau's Zhabei Branch.

<h3>Extortionist Sentenced to Two Years</h3>
<p>At 9:30 AM on the 22nd of last month, the family of Gan Zhupan, a Cantonese, at No. 690 Broadway Road, received a red envelope delivered by a bandit, containing a threatening letter stating that they must give 500 yuan in foreign currency, otherwise they would resort to drastic measures. Later, they called to urge the payment, and as a result, they agreed to give 100 yuan, asking him to come and get it. They also notified the Huishan Patrol to send Detective Chen Baozhong to wait near the door. The next morning, Wang Zongying from Jiangbei came with the letter to collect the money, but he did not dare to enter, loitering outside the door, and was arrested by Detective Chen, and the letter was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over the continued trial in the Third Criminal Court. Industrial Bureau lawyer Li Zhishan recounted the incident and stated that during the period of the change, the defendant confessed that a Xiaoningbo had asked him to go and collect the foreign currency, but this person could not be found. He requested a strict sentence. When questioned, the defendant insisted that Xiaoningbo had given him a letter at the time, saying that he had already agreed with Gan's compradore to collect 100 yuan, and asked him to have dinner and watch a show after receiving it. The rest of the confession was evasive. Judge Xiao sentenced Wang Zhongying to two years of imprisonment, and the letter was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Modern Female Thief</h3>
<p>Shanghai is a place where all kinds of people gather, good and bad are mixed, and cases of fraud, theft, and adultery emerge one after another. Recently, modern girls have been found to specialize in intruding into residential homes in various alleys. When someone sees them, they falsely claim to be asking for the surname, and when no one sees them, they take the opportunity to steal clothes and other items. Yesterday morning, at a certain number in Shiwenli, behind the Slaughterhouse Company in the French Concession, a modern girl suddenly appeared, wearing a silk cheongsam, a velvet short coat, gloves, and high-heeled leather shoes, and was quite young. She entered through the back door and walked upstairs. The servants in the kitchen suspected that she was a relative of the people upstairs, and the servant of the people upstairs suspected that she was a relative of the second landlord downstairs. As a result, she stole clothes and bedding. When the matter was discovered, the female thief had already disappeared without a trace, and there was no way to catch her. They could only admit their bad luck and advise all residents to be careful in the future.</p>

A criticism seat was set up in the small pavilion in front of the venue, welcoming criticisms. Most people praised the beauty of the products from various provinces and cities and their practicality. The national defense designs of the labor courses in primary schools were particularly praised. Among them, the comments of middle school student Ma Tugan and others were the most accurate. The original words were: "The crops of Shandong and Hebei pay more attention to practicality, while Jiangsu and Zhejiang are more inclined to art. The embroidery of Hunan, the porcelain of Jiangxi, and the lacquer of Fujian are particularly outstanding."</p>

<h3>Vocational Exhibition and Labor Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Zhong Daozan</p>
<p>The promotion of vocational education in our country has been ongoing for years. We have heard of regional inspections of the achievements of its facilities in various provinces and cities over the years. The National Vocational Education Discussion Annual Meeting has also often held achievement exhibitions in the provinces and cities near the venue of the annual meeting. However, this is indeed the first time that the achievements of students from vocational schools across the country have been gathered in one place for a long-term exhibition.</p>
<p>The subject of labor is the newest term in the curriculum of primary and secondary schools. In reality, it seems to be broader in scope than the former crafts or manual labor. At the same time, it is also more difficult to implement than before. Since its promotion, the period has not been long, but there are many people who pay attention to this subject. Magazines and newspapers often publish their novel views. Even those who go abroad to study education often take this as one of their goals. On the occasion of this vocational education exhibition, we should jointly show the reality of its facilities for the research of educators. The exhibits sent this time are diverse and of varying quality. Some are known for their local specialties, such as Xiangnan embroidery, Fujian lacquerware, and Jiangxi ceramics. Some are good at models and teaching aids, such as military models from Shanghai, Zhejiang, Henan and other provinces and cities, and teaching aids from Hebei, Fujian, and other provinces. Some use teaching procedures to show step-by-step manufacturing methods, such as the mechanical woodworking products of the China Vocational School, and the chemical and dyeing works of the Vocational School attached to the Hebei Institute of Technology. Some use work-study education as a facility of ordinary middle schools to express their special spirit of labor, such as Beiping Qiuzhi Middle School. Some have created and invented spinning machines, such as the Han Women's Vocational Supplementary School in Ping City. There are so many excellent points that it is impossible to list them all.</p>
<p>Our country's vocational education, such as embroidery and sewing, dyeing and weaving carpets, metalworking machinery, and ceramics and lacquerware, all have some slight manifestations. However, agriculture, which is related to the foundation of the country, has very few achievements. In recent years, governments at all levels have spared no effort to promote agriculture. People from all walks of life have also regarded this as an important plan for revitalizing the countryside. Although higher agricultural education institutions have considerable achievements, the secondary technical personnel who are responsible for promoting and improving preliminary agriculture have not yet achieved anything. This is a question that should be discussed after the closing of this exhibition.</p>
<p>Embroidery, lacquerware, and carpets are special products of our country's handicrafts. However, because their work is cumbersome, time-consuming, and the output is small, the price is high, and they are often not affordable for the general public. They have almost become luxury goods for the leisure class. We should engage in research on simple and ordinary products suitable for general application, so that the majority of people in society have the ability to purchase them, so as to popularize skills and promote sales of products.</p>
<p>Labor education in primary schools focuses on cultivating labor habits, while middle schools focus on cultivating work skills. However, due to the lack of appropriate teachers, the teaching materials are still the same as before. Learners are uninterested and often perfunctory, taking responsibility for fulfilling their duties as their ability. Some even do not list this subject, believing that a small amount of time will never create skills, and it is better to teach other subjects to gain some benefits. There is no need to elaborate on the bias of this view. In recent years, European middle schools have paid much attention to the work of gold and woodworking, which are not only the basic tools for all sciences, but also the main skills in national military education. In our country, there are very few middle schools that can have appropriate facilities for this, such as woodworking workbenches and forging machinery workshops. They often use clay, paper, bamboo, iron wire, and rattan work for their ordinary practice, because it is easier to achieve and can be done by ordinary old-style manual teachers. A few months ago, the principal of a middle school in Jiangsu, seeing that Japanese middle school students were engaged in the manufacture of scientific tools, which was enough to improve students' interest in science education, also followed suit. The intention was very good. In fact, the teaching materials of the middle school labor subject should be set up in this way to develop students' creative spirit.</p>
<p>Although primary school labor cannot be as difficult as middle school, all old-fashioned cardboard work, bean work, paper-cutting work, clay work, and operations without educational significance or practical value should be eliminated, and replaced by gardening, poultry raising, and planting of ordinary crops, or craft operations with simple practicality. In addition to practicing simple skills, it also cultivates the habits of group life. Therefore, effective training of teachers for labor subjects in primary and secondary schools, practical research on teaching materials, and the minimum standards for labor subject equipment are also two issues to be resolved at this exhibition. A friend of mine once wrote an article in the autumn to draw the attention of the society, saying that we should not only use the exhibition as its duty, which is indeed another view.</p>
<p>The exhibits sent by various provinces and cities this time total more than 29,700 pieces. A total of 25 provinces and cities participated. The results sent range from 20 pieces to more than 3,200 pieces. With the country's area so wide, the small number is certainly not much. But if the works sent are all meaningful, valuable, and are the expression of students' usual work, then even if there are few, there are many. In recent years, the problems in education have gradually increased due to the progress of science. Labor education in primary and secondary schools that uses both hands and brains has become more difficult due to its vast content. When we visit this exhibition, we should quickly arouse the points that we need to pay attention to in education, and jointly seek to solve them.</p>
<h3>Visit to the Venue (2) Student</h3>
<p>The display places of the schools in the capital are: sewing and middle school rattan work are displayed in the first room; embroidery, weaving, rattan work of blind and deaf schools, practical achievements of vocational supplementary schools, work drawings, etc. are displayed in the second small room; scientific instruments for primary and secondary schools, track and field models, clay metal work paper work are displayed on the shelves in the main room of the second hall.</p>
<p>Minister of Education Wang Shijie visits (Photo by Nanjing Zhonghua)</p>
<p>There are many sorghum stalk woven objects and biological specimens. There are four boxes of geographical teaching aids on both sides of the podium, which are exquisitely made. The weaving machine program and tools are displayed on the podium to form a complete unit. Nanjing machine weaving is famous throughout the country, and this special product design is the most meaningful. In addition, there is a full box of primary school furniture models, a simple primary school new village model, a full box of artificial marble procedures, a model of sanitary habits, a unit of agricultural design, the causes of rice, etc., which are the essence of the city's representative works. Woodworking toys are the most valuable in the evolution of the car, from the simplest car to the latest car. There are also meaningful evolutionary models of various weapons. There are many other types of labor works in primary and secondary schools, but they are very common. Among them, there is a unit of cleaning appliances and fly medicine, which has great value for teaching. The city's products total about 800 pieces, and then fold into</p>

<p>Shanghai City's product display place. The city's products are very many, and the location is limited. Fortunately, the city's representatives designed and arranged them in a very orderly manner, so they can brilliantly express the city's achievements. Its display method is unique, and the products are divided into two categories: one is the Shanghai City schools representative achievements, and the other is the Shanghai City Education Bureau's counseling achievements. School achievements focus on the unit vocational part, represented by the China Vocational School, divided into five kinds of physical achievements: fitter, turner, carpenter, blacksmith, and foundry. The physical objects and charts are compared, and it is clear at a glance. The middle school part is like Xinlu Normal School's metalworking sequence wood specimens, Lida College's beekeeping and chicken raising unit, Jianguo Middle School's furniture Jingye Middle School's economic housing design, etc. are all good, and the private Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School's minimum equipment unit is the most exquisite. The primary school part is the New Life Movement unit picture of embroidery in Ming Stealing Primary School, and An Primary School's National Defense Museum displays many guns, artillery, radio tanks, gunboats, airplanes, etc. The primary school also has a zoo, which is also very interesting. The primary school has another zoo, which is also very interesting. Bede Primary School's student table and chair and dictionary rack method sequence unit, Nongchang Primary School toy production unit, Shangwen Primary School transportation equipment manufacturing unit, household sewing unit, weapon model manufacturing unit, animal model unit, practical craft unit, etc. It is said that the primary school usually pays much attention to labor subjects. The cost of participating in the exhibition this time is the most. Wanzhu Primary School's soap and candle making unit, Yangzheng Primary School's comparison of the evolution of food, clothing, housing and transportation, are all design units. In addition, the parts are divided into gold, wood, stone, etc. and displayed separately, and the grades are marked separately to make it easy to judge the value of the works. Counseling achievements are divided into two parts: one is teaching and research, and the other is statistics. The statistical table is displayed in the third hall, and the research materials are hung on the shelves. The content is based on the curriculum standards published by the Ministry of Education, and refers to the Shanghai environment. If you can read it in detail, it will be of great help to labor education. Representative Mr. Zhang explained it in detail, making people understand it clearly. The total number of products is about 2,000 pieces. From here, fold into</p>
<p>Jiangsu Region. Jiangsu is the most developed area of education in the country, and its achievements are naturally excellent. The most outstanding achievements include pottery, such as Yixing porcelain, plain fired porcelain, Xuzhou porcelain, etc. The glass utensils made by Suqian Middle School are exquisitely made and far superior to imported goods.

<p>The Municipal Library and Museum Held a Cornerstone Laying Ceremony Yesterday</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Presided Over the Ceremony and Delivered a Speech and Personally Laid the Cornerstone</h3>
<p>Since the municipal government moved into the city center, it has actively carried out various municipal construction projects. The gymnasium, swimming pool, and sports field were laid the cornerstone a few days ago. The museum and library will hold a cornerstone laying ceremony at 3 pm yesterday. Representatives from all walks of life went to participate, which was very grand. The following is a record of the situation:</p>
<p>Venue Layout The library is located between Fuqian Right Road and Funan Right Road in the city center, south of Fuxi Outer Road, facing west and east. The museum is located between Fuqian Left Road and Funan Left Road, south of Fudong Outer Road, facing east and west, opposite the library. The cornerstone laying ceremony venue is on the library base, which is a temporary shed. There is a colorful archway at the entrance, with a red satin horizontal banner hanging on it, "Shanghai Municipal Library and Museum Cornerstone Laying Ceremony". To the left of the venue is the model room. There are three types of models: the library model on the left, the museum model on the right, and the bird's-eye view model of the city center in the middle.</p>
<p>Attendees Yesterday, the attendees included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Xu Peihuang, Section Chief Li Dachao of the First Section of the Municipal Government, Section Chief Zhu Fengwei of the Third Section, Xue Cixin, Shen Tong, Shen Gao, Xu Yefu of various bureaus and sections, Vice Director Wu Shaozeng of the Lianglu Administration, Chairman Wang Xiaolai of the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, President Li Zhaohuan of Jiaotong University, President Zhang Shouyong of Guanghua University, General Manager Wang Yunwu of the Commercial Press, Qu Wenliu of the Various Provinces Drought Disaster Relief Committee, Guo Shun, a member of the Municipal Council, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi and Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Zhuping and other thousands of people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report After the ceremony, Chairman Mayor Wu reported, roughly saying, everyone, December 1, 23rd year of the Republic of China, is a memorable day. This morning, the unprecedented 22-story high building, the International Hotel, held its opening. This afternoon, there are also unprecedented libraries and museums holding a cornerstone laying ceremony. The opening of the 22-story high International Hotel shows the development and progress of the city's construction industry, and the library and museum are important buildings for culture, which will promote the consolidation of the Chinese nation's inherent culture, consolidate the foundation of China's inherent culture, and create a new culture for the nation. Shanghai has a history of nearly 100 years, with a population of 3.4 million. It is known as one of the five major cities in the world. Unfortunately, in the past, cultural undertakings were neglected due to various reasons, so it is not only not comparable to major cities in Europe and the United States, but also inferior to other cities in the country. Now, the municipal government should meet the needs of the people of the city and get the help of leaders from all walks of life, and be able to hold the cornerstone laying ceremony of the library and museum today. We deeply believe that the construction of culture has a great relationship with the country and the nation. Without cultural construction, it is like a person with only a body and no spirit, the so-called strong outside and weak inside. A nation that cannot promote its inherent culture will exist in name only. A city without cultural facilities will reduce the facilities of the city. A city government that cannot think about the cultural facilities for its citizens is like eating something and not knowing the taste of it. Our ancestors have made great efforts for thousands of years to create culture, and have made great contributions to the world's human beings directly and indirectly. This is recognized by the world. How can we not work hard to promote it today? Today, the Chinese nation is often wandering on a fork in the road, so that China, although it has a glorious history of thousands of years, a large population, and a vast land, shows its weaknesses everywhere. Therefore, if we want to revive the Chinese nation, turn weakness into strength, and save the country and survive, it will not be successful if we do not promote China's inherent culture. From now on, we should make up our minds to promote China's inherent culture and create China's new culture so that all men, women, old and young, rich and poor, should have self-confidence, and believe that the Chinese people can govern China and build China themselves. In this way, a new China can definitely be built, and the Chinese nation can definitely be revived. Finally, there are a few words about the library. Mr. Ding Fubao and Mr. Wu Liande are willing to donate all their collections. This good news is worth reporting to everyone. We deeply believe that scholars in the world are not necessarily created in schools. Many scholars are nurtured in libraries. We want to hope that all the people of the city must have the opportunity to read books, then the library is a necessary facility. The construction of the library is by no means something that can satisfy people in a short period of time. The government should gradually make it more complete year by year, and collectors from all walks of life should follow the example of Mr. Ding and Mr. Wu to help enrich the library. As for the museum, we want the general public to understand the treasures of China and arouse the patriotism of the citizens. We hope that collectors can also do their best to help enrich the museum. One person collects it, only one person knows the loveliness and preciousness of Chinese treasures. When it is publicly displayed in this museum, it can make everyone know it and make everyone love the country. Today, I am grateful for the enthusiastic participation of all walks of life.</p>
<p>Guest Speeches After Mayor Wu finished his report, Wang Yunwu gave a speech first, roughly saying that since I took office as the chairman of the library and museum preparation committee at the request of Mayor Wu, I have seen Mayor Wu's enthusiasm and efforts for the construction of Shanghai's cultural undertakings, and I am deeply impressed. Although it is limited by time, seeing the importance of cultural undertakings, I cannot but do my best to plan. The cornerstone laying of the sports field was held not many days ago, and the cornerstone laying ceremony of the various libraries and museums followed one after another, which sincerely makes all the citizens of the city grateful for Mayor Wu's enthusiastic spirit of promoting cultural undertakings. Just now Mayor Wu said that this morning there was the opening of the 22-story high International Hotel, and this afternoon there was the cornerstone laying of the various libraries and museums, which is truly a memorable day for Shanghai. This matter, in terms of engineering, the 22-story high building should be much more, but in terms of cultural significance, the cornerstone laying of the library and museum should be much higher. Since Mayor Wu took office, his efforts to build the city center have been affected by the January 28th war, but since this incident, Mayor Wu has continued his efforts to make the construction of the city center more and more prosperous. This is truly enough to break the mentality of the Chinese people that everything can only be done by foreigners. I have no experience in museums, but I have some research on libraries. The library is not comparable to the past Chinese collection buildings. The collection building is owned by individuals, and the library is for public use. The design of the library should be considered from two aspects: one is books and the other is the museum. Therefore, when preparing, I attached importance to this point. According to the design of the museum, it can store 400,000 books, and the area is 15,000 square meters, then each book can occupy 3 to 4 square inches. However, Chinese-bound books are often less than 3 to 4 square inches thick, so if we consider half Chinese-bound books and half Western-bound books, Chinese-bound books can hold 800,000 books, and Western-bound books can hold 200,000 books, totaling 1 million books. Now that the museum has laid the cornerstone, I hope that the government can allocate funds to purchase these 1 million books year by year. With a plan of 3 yuan per book, the so-called per book, with 3 to 4 square inches as a unit, then 1.2 million yuan is needed. If the municipal government allocates 100,000 yuan per year, then all the books can be purchased in 12 years. After the library is established, I hope that it can be used as much as possible and strive for universality, so as to achieve great results. Next, Qian Xinzhi gave a speech, roughly saying that since the establishment of the library and museum preparation committee two years ago, everyone felt that it was not easy to be competent due to the difficulty of economic fundraising and the twists and turns of planning. Now Mayor Wu, with his decisive spirit, has broken through all the difficulties, and held the cornerstone laying ceremony of the library and museum today, and it can be completed by next year's Double Ten Festival. This not only makes me optimistic about the future of Shanghai's cultural construction, but also the success of the construction of Greater Shanghai will not be far away. Next, Wang Xiaolai said that the concession has a history of decades, and the city center is a matter of the present. The concession relies on foreigners to prosper, and the prosperity of the city center requires the Chinese to do it themselves. Now that the land price in the concession is expensive and the population is mixed, the city center is well-equipped and the air is fresh. Therefore, the construction of the city center is a measure of the patriotism of the Chinese people. In terms of reason, the Chinese people should know to leave the concession and come to the city center in the future to jointly plan the prosperity of the city center. Today, the concession has the construction of a 22-story large house. I hope that the Four Banks Savings Society will also build a large building in the city center next year.</p>

<p>Cornerstone Laying Ceremony of the Library and Museum</p>
<p>Laying the Cornerstone Ceremony After the speeches, the cornerstone laying ceremony was held. Led by the Public Security Bureau Military Band, Mayor Wu and the guests came out in file, first to the library cornerstone platform. The cornerstone was covered with the party and national flag. Mayor Wu raised the party and national flag. The cornerstone was carved with gold characters such as "Shanghai Municipal Library Cornerstone Laying Commemoration, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, October 23rd year of the Republic of China". Mayor Wu held a white copper mud knife made by Zhang Yutai Construction Factory, first put the map box into the cornerstone, then used the mud knife to excavate cement, applied it to the缺口, and then folded it to the museum to hold the museum cornerstone laying ceremony according to the library cornerstone laying procedure.</p>
<p>High School Outstanding Students Friendship Movement Held Its First Symposium Yesterday</p>
<h3>Over Three Hundred Outstanding Students from More Than Fifty Schools Were Specially Invited. Liu Wendao and Pan Gongzhan Attended and Gave Speeches.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Party Department, the initiator and organizer of the High School Second and Third Grade Outstanding Student Friendship Movement, held its first symposium at 1:30 PM yesterday at the Foreign Affairs Building next to the Fenglin Bridge Municipal Party Department. Ambassador Liu Wendao to Italy and Municipal Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan were invited to give speeches. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Schools: Those present yesterday included Ambassador Liu Wendao and his wife to Italy, Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau, Tao Baichuan, Lin Meiyan, Yu Zhongbiao, and Wang Longzhang of the Municipal Party Department. Schools present included Wuben, Jingye, Minli, Nanyang, Guanghua, Daxia, Datong, Tongji, Pudong, Peiming, McLaren, Dagong, Chizhi, Junyi, Qingxin, Fudan, Xinlu, Aiguo, Hujiang, Lida, Huiling, Xinya, Shangnv, Huadong, Dongya, Dongnan, Zhengfeng, Kaiming, Nangao, Shangyou, Shangzhong, Biwen, Guangxia, Qiaoguang, Minguang, Binhai, Qiming, Huahua, Cihang, Zhirenyong, and Zhonghua Vocational, totaling more than fifty schools and over three hundred outstanding second and third grade high school students.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: The meeting commenced at 1:30 PM, chaired by Tao Baichuan and emceed by Wang Longzhang. After formalities such as greetings led by Yu Zhongbiao and Lin Meiyan, Chairman Tao delivered a speech, followed by speeches by Ambassador Liu Wendao to Italy and Director Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Education Bureau. Students then introduced themselves, and the event concluded with a group photo and refreshments.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Tao Baichuan stated in his address, "Distinguished students, the Municipal Party Department is holding the first symposium of the High School Outstanding Student Friendship Movement today, and we are very honored that you have all enthusiastically participated. I believe you are all very pleased as well. From the perspective of the Municipal Party Department, seeing so many lovely young people here today, who are the life of the nation, the leaders of society, and the vitality of the country, makes us very honored. In the past, the Ministry of Education had a statistic that only one high school student out of two or three thousand was considered outstanding. Today, those present are the most outstanding among them, making their value even more precious. It is anticipated that they will become pillars of the nation and leaders of society in the future. Therefore, the Party Department feels extremely honored. From your perspective, it is also a great honor because the Kuomintang is the only political party in China, and the Municipal Party Department is Shanghai's cadre. It is truly rare for them to specially host you today. Furthermore, it is an even rarer opportunity to have Ambassador Liu Wendao here to give a speech. Finally, on behalf of the Municipal Party Department, I extend a sincere welcome to all of you."</p>
<p>Speeches by Notables: Ambassador Liu Wendao to Italy delivered a speech, stating, "The most troubling issue for young people today is the severity of the national crisis and how to recover our lost territories and revitalize China. This is something every young person constantly thinks about. To solve this problem, we must first understand the history of revitalization of various countries and the state of China's national crisis. The situation in France when it was defeated by Prussia is the same as when China was invaded by Japan in the Northeast Provinces. After the European War, Germany signed a treaty to pay reparations, and its suffering was even greater than that of China today. However, France and Germany ultimately restored their territories and alleviated their suffering through unanimous support for the central government from top to bottom. If China can unite and support the central government with one heart and one mind, I believe that we will definitely be able to recover our lost territories in fifteen years. The entire Italian nation has been disciplined, especially emphasizing the discipline of mutual assistance. The so-called discipline is the New Life Movement promoted by Chairman Chiang, which includes propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Discipline is mutual assistance, and mutual assistance is discipline. Therefore, I hope that you will practice the New Life Movement, and then China will have hope." Director Pan Gongzhan's speech was lengthy, so it is omitted.</p>
<p>Friendship Program: Finally, Tao Baichuan reported on the friendship program, stating that the High School Student Friendship Movement is scheduled to hold four gatherings. Today is the first. The second will be an excursion, tentatively scheduled for Longhua, because Longhua offers many social materials: (1) an orphanage, (2) a vagrant work-study center, and (3) the Jiangsu Second Prison. A discussion will be held in the auditorium of the vagrant work-study center. The third will be a discussion on youth issues, with experts invited to answer questions. The fourth will be an excursion to Wusong, where we can visit the battlefields of the Songhu War and cooperate with the National Military Training Association to practice shooting once. Mayor Wu will also be invited to give a speech at the Municipal Auditorium. Next, he stated,</p>

<p>Sports News</p>
<h3>Skota Cup Second Round: Donghua Heavily Defeats Innis for the Second Time.</h3>
<p>Five to Zero, Donghua Gains the Replay Right.</p>
<p>Innis's Strength is Just So-So.</p>
<p>Innis was previously defeated by Donghua 0-4 in the Group A League. Yesterday, they competed with Donghua again in the Skota Cup second round at Yiyuan. In the first half, Donghua scored three consecutive goals, boosting morale. After the break, the Innis team focused on defense, but ultimately failed and lost two more goals, ending with a score of 5-0. Although Donghua was missing Cao Qiuting in this battle, Jia Youliang, who filled the gap, was fierce and lively and was able to do the job. Newcomer Chen Gongyu at fullback was also agile and pleasing. Innis's center-back Thomson was a talented player in both attack and defense. If the team didn't have him, the number of goals lost would have been even higher. The audience was about 5,000 people.</p>
<h3>The British Team is Mediocre.</h3>
<p>It is rumored that Innis is strong, but so far, it is an exaggeration. There are two major problems: (1) The forwards lack shooting talent, missing opportunities; (2) The whole team has no self-restraint, and they are rude if they are not satisfied. They recently lost to Donghua in the Group A game, and yesterday they were defeated again by Donghua 0-5 in the Skota Cup. Donghua is strong inside, but also agile outside. The absence of Guan Xun'an had no impact at all. Chen Gongyu's ability can cope with all parties, and Jia Youliang's great contribution is worthy of our attention. His future is unlimited. Feng Yunyou restored his golden age style, and all his sons were able to maintain their original skills, which is gratifying to those who love Donghua.</p>
<h3>Yi Chen Scores Twice in a Row.</h3>
<p>Donghua kicked off facing east, and the line of sight seemed to be unfavorable. Innis's left and right wings first invaded the mainland. Once they failed, and almost caused a catastrophe. Ke Lanli attacked the gate, and Zhong En made amends and caught it high. At this time, the Innis soldiers were very strong and attacked frequently. Li Ning was eager to save the ball, and his nose was wounded. Blood spurted out and he left the field for treatment. After the home ball was transferred back to the defense, the four forwards did not worry about the loss of the general. The counterattack was even more urgent. Jia Youliang launched an uprising on the border, and A Dai echoed from afar. Li Yichen penetrated the lone army and scored a goal. Eight minutes later, Li Ning left the field with injuries, and morale was greatly boosted. Yi Chen passed it to Xiao Wan, dribbled a few steps, turned into the middle, Yi Chen opened a big step and shot into the gate, becoming a score of 2-0.</p>
<h3>Xiao Dai's Surprise Attack.</h3>
<p>Wan Xianghua got the ball and passed it to a dangerous position. Unexpectedly, Jia Youliang was already offside. Although he had hit the ball in, it was declared invalid. Li Yichen passed the ball to Jia, who broke through the midfield. MacKinnon and Collins were fighting for the ball, killing each other, causing laughter from the audience. But it can also be seen the fierceness of the dust war at that time. Chen Gongyu's feet were crisp, and the ball passed more than half the field. A Dai saw that the time had come, and went straight to Hong J. McClelland couldn't catch up, and lost another goal. The break time soon arrived.</p>
<h3>Youliang Enjoyed the Fruits of His Labor.</h3>
<p>After changing Chen's place in the second half, Donghua's momentum was still strong. The attack and defense were orderly. Mao Quilan struggled to go upstream and was about to reach the shooting area, but Gu Shangyi was waiting for work and drove him out of the country. Youliang got the ball and circled in. MacKinnon came to grab it, and Jia immediately handed it over to Lao Ji. After a little hovering, the two guards rushed to resist. Smithton also put down his broadsword and rushed to Li. Unexpectedly, Yi Chen was cunning, and his feet turned into flowers. Xiao Jia saw the flaws and jumped into the bush and sent the ball into the net. The fans applauded and reported the lottery.</p>
<h3>Donghua Scores Another Empty Goal.</h3>
<p>The Innis soldiers became more and more angry. The forwards had no pure cooperation and sharp shooting, so they sighed that they had no skills when they reached the Donghua defense. Yi Chen grabbed the ball and accidentally fell to the ground. J. McClelland did not kick the ball but kicked someone. Li Nuos punished him with a free kick, which caused S. McClelland's dissatisfaction and uttered bad words. Unfortunately, it was heard by the referee again, and he was asked to leave the field. Innis fought with ten players, and it became more scattered. The home ball was a long pass, Xiao Jia Smithton left the gate without authorization, Yi Chen got this good opportunity, and wrote it down easily, sending it into the empty gate, becoming a score of 5-0.</p>

<h3>What Is Called Difficult</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>The opposite of difficult is easy, and the opposite of easy is difficult. Doing is easy, not doing is difficult. Difficult things will make you successful, because difficult things must be thought about with your brain. You think easy things are easy, so you don't think about them. I'm afraid the things you do won't be good.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this? It's just that one is done with care, and the other is done easily, and the results they get are naturally very different. Difficult things, you must think about with your smart brain, think well and then implement them, then there is nothing difficult in the world. Easy things, you do them casually, and there will be no good results, which shows that easy things are not necessarily all easy. As the saying goes: "As long as you work hard enough, you can grind an iron rod into a needle", in this sentence, you can know that difficult things must take a long time to do before they can be successful.</p>
<p>So when we are young, we must know that doing is easy, and not doing is difficult. We do not not do because it is difficult, nor do we do it casually because it is easy. Conversely, we do it carefully because it is difficult, and we work hard because it is easy. If we develop such good habits, we will be able to do both difficult and easy things when we serve in society in the future.</p>
<h3>What Am I? What Is Me?</h3>
<p>— Geng Jianzhai's Wife</p>
<p>Children! Let me tell you a story first: Once upon a time, a public official was escorting a criminal monk to the superior's office. On the way, he stayed in an inn. The public official was tired and slept soundly all night. The monk broke the shackles and shaved the head of the sleeping public official, and fled in a puff of smoke. The public official woke up, touched his head, and was shocked and said: "Oh! The monk is still here, where have I gone?"</p>
<p>This public official is really confused, and if his hair is gone, he doesn't even recognize himself. But everyone, think about it: how many people in the world can really recognize their true colors? How many people can really keep their true colors forever?</p>
<p>Everything in the world is changing all the time. The 20th century world is no longer the 19th century world, let alone the world before the era. As for people, today's me is not yesterday's me, let alone the me who was just born. By tomorrow and next year, where can I find today's me? Is this constantly changing physical body really me?</p>
<p>A flower blooms, bears fruit, and the flower doesn't know where it went. The fruit falls into the mud and grows into new trees, and the fruit doesn't know where it went again. It is new flowers and new fruits again. The me that we recognize is just a flower and a fruit. After all, "What am I?" "What is me?"</p>
<h3>Yellow Chrysanthemum</h3>
<p>— Weihua</p>
<p>Yellow chrysanthemum, yellow like gold,</p>
<p>Sister folds a branch;</p>
<p>"Dad, take it to relieve the disaster victims!"</p>
<p>White chrysanthemum, white as silver.</p>
<p>Sister folds a branch;</p>
<p>"Mom, take it to relieve the disaster victims!"</p>
<p>Disaster relief requires silver,</p>
<p>How can thousands upon thousands of chrysanthemums be turned into silver?</p>
<p>Disaster relief requires gold,</p>
<p>How can thousands upon thousands of chrysanthemums be turned into gold?</p>
<h3>Famous Continents and Oceans on Earth</h3>
<p>— Bitter</p>
<p>Little friends, the famous continents and oceans on Earth, in our old textbooks, were all described as the five continents of Asia, Europe, America, Africa, and Oceania, and the five oceans of the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and the Antarctic Ocean. However, according to recent explorations by explorers, a continent has been added and an ocean has been reduced. So now, on Earth, we should say there are six continents and four oceans. The six continents are Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania. The four oceans are the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<h3>Small Seasonal Toys for Early Winter</h3>
<p>— Zhiyuan</p>
<p>Orchid Fireworks: After eating olive pits, save them one by one, dry them in the sun, use a needle to pierce a small hole in the tip of the pit, and stick it onto a candle on a candlestick. The tip of the pit must be close to the candle wick. The candle used must be an old-fashioned candle, not a paraffin candle. When lit, it will continuously spray out orchid petal-like flames, piece by piece, in the form of an orchid. The reason for this is that the small holes in the pit contain air, which, when surrounded and burned by the candle flame, causes the air inside to escape urgently and continue to burst out, thus releasing the orchid-like sparks. Without artificial manufacturing, it can still be done, please appreciate this beautiful firework.</p>
<p>Iron Chrysanthemum Blooming: Usually, when you open a cigarette tin, keep the circular tin pieces that are cut off. Paste each piece with colored paper or white powder paper on both sides. Any color is fine, but both sides must be pasted with the same color. After it is completely dry, cut thin strips around the circumference, moving them up and down, and it will become a chrysanthemum called "Sen Zhen." Punch a hole in the center, thread it with iron wire to make a flower stem, and make many of these flowers, inserting them into a vase. From a distance, they look no different from real chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>Fragrant Citrus Box: When a citron is about to dry and shrink, don't discard it. Cut off a quarter of the entire fruit near the stem. Dig out the seeds and pulp in the middle, carefully peel off the white skin inside, and fold a roll of the edge inward at the opening. Then, divide it into equal parts, such as four, six, or eight squares, and slowly twist it into a square shape with your hands. The square must be accurate, and each side must be of equal width to avoid affecting the appearance. However, this work cannot be completed in a rush, so don't be impatient. It can be done in multiple stages, continuing in your spare time. Once it is made, place it in a ventilated place and let it dry in the shade for a long time. It will become a beautiful box that is durable and will not break for many years.</p>
<p>Mandarin Orange Flower Basket: Cut off a quarter of a large Guang mandarin orange near the stem. Use a small knife and spoon to remove the pulp and eat it. Carve beautiful patterns on the outside of the orange peel using a manual carving method, and you will have a clever and exquisite little flower basket. Pierce four small holes around the mouth, hang it with thread, and then place a few brightly colored golden chrysanthemums for even more interest.</p>
<h3>Buying Socks Without Measuring Feet</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiongjian</p>
<p>Little Knowledge: The weather is gradually getting colder, and the silk or thread socks on children's feet can no longer withstand the cold. Most will ask their parents to buy a few pairs of thread socks or wool socks. If your parents grant your request and take you to the store to buy socks, the color will be chosen, and the price will be negotiated, but how do you know if the size of the socks fits? Little friends!</p>
<p>I will teach you a method. You don't have to take off your shoes, sit on a stool, and then measure the length. Just extend your fist and ask your father or mother to hold the top of the sock with one hand and the heel with the other. If it wraps around your fist perfectly, neither too big nor too small, then the size of the sock is just right. Don't believe it? Try it.</p>
<h3>Children's Science Lecture: Housing</h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>Whether insects, fish, birds, or beasts, as long as they are animals, they all know how to find a place to hide. In our human life, the problem of housing is even more important. Little friends all know that we live in houses. But there are very many kinds of houses, especially after many improvements, houses have become what they are today.</p>
<p>Why do we need to live in houses? Little friends must also know the answer: first, to avoid wind, frost, rain, and snow; second, to ensure safety. In primitive times, humans lived in caves and the wilderness. (Figure 1) But living like this, wild animals would come to attack, and wind and rain could not be avoided. So they built houses by putting up branches. Like the natives of the South Pacific islands today, they use branches to build houses. (Figure 2) However, this kind of wooden house is indeed an improvement compared to living in caves and the wilderness, but when a big storm comes, there is a risk of collapse. Many wild animals that can climb trees will still come to harm them, so they had to think of other ways to defend themselves. Thus, they further used mud and grass to build houses. Some were also built with wooden boards. (Figure 3) At this time, most people lived near rivers, but mud and grass houses were easily destroyed by floods. Later, the improved houses were made of brick and stone, and the invention of multi-story buildings (Figure 4) was very different from the houses of ancient times.</p>
<p>In recent years, because land prices are high, the area of houses is not easy to expand, so high-rise buildings are built, and the materials are also more solid, using cement and steel to build. (Figure 5) With the progress of human life, housing naturally progresses along with it.</p>
<p>Because housing is a need in life, there is also a type of house that can be moved at any time, which is the tent in the Mongolian region of northwestern China. (Figure 6) They live in the desert and rely on animal husbandry for a living, so they have to move their homes wherever they can find water and grass. Their houses are completely different from our houses.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Eggs</h3>
<p>— Sha Yongcai</p>
<p>Little friends! Do you like to eat eggs? Eggs are a kind of thing that contains a lot of "vitamins," and eating them is definitely very beneficial. But when we buy them, we must buy fresh ones, because fresh ones are hygienic. But what method can we use to judge? Now there is a very simple method, which is that when buying eggs, we can prepare a bowl of clear water and put the egg in the water. If it is fresh, it will definitely sink to the bottom of the water without hesitation. If it is bad or not fresh, it will float on the surface of the water. What is the reason for this? It's actually very simple, because the weight of the yolk and the egg white inside the egg are different compared to the weight of water. The weight of the yolk is lighter than water, while the weight of the egg white is heavier than water. In a fresh egg, the amount of yolk is less than the amount of egg white. Because there is less yolk and more egg white, it sinks to the bottom of the water. Conversely, if it is not fresh or bad, the amount of yolk is more than the amount of egg white. Because the yolk has been growing larger over time and gradually absorbs the egg white. The amount of egg white decreases, and the weight of the entire egg becomes lighter, so it floats on the surface of the water.</p>
<h3>Little Joke</h3>
<p>— Yiyiguan Master</p>
<p>One day, Hui'er's father took him to the street to buy Western socks. When they arrived at a sock store, he asked the clerk to bring out many socks to choose from.</p>
<p>After a while, Hui'er's father picked out a pair of white socks and asked him, "Do you like these socks?"</p>
<p>When Hui'er heard his father ask him this, and at the same time, he saw several pairs of black socks, he thought that since his father called the white ones "sheep socks," then these black ones could certainly be called "cow socks." So, he pointed to the black socks and said to his father, "I don't want those white 'sheep socks,' I want these black 'cow socks'!"</p>
<h3>Children Around the World</h3>
<p>— Wen Yuyang</p>
<p>(1) There are large deserts in Arabia? The characters we use in arithmetic were invented by them. The clothes worn by friends there are made of a large piece of cloth that wraps around the head and body, leaving only a small part of the face exposed. They often ride donkeys wherever they go.</p>
<p>(2) Tibet is in the southwestern part of our country. The children there wear cloths on their heads, and their clothes are very messy. We must find it very unsightly, but they have become accustomed to it. They rarely study and help their families with hard labor every day.</p>
<p>(3) Korea was originally a part of our country, but it was later taken by Japan. The clothes worn by the children there are ancient Chinese costumes, and their shoes are also very special. They are now people of a conquered nation, living a life of slavery every day, and they also study Japanese. Moreover, most of the children don't go to school!</p>
<p>(4) The children in France live a very happy life. They have books to read and games to play. Their favorite game is racing with other children in small cars.</p>
<h3>Dew and Frost</h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>The principle of the formation of dew is that the ground absorbs the sun's heat during the day, and at night, this heat is released. When heat comes into contact with cold air, it turns into dew. The released heat is called "thermal radiation" in physics. However, the heat absorbed during the day, when radiated at midnight, if the sky is clear, there will be more dew. If the sky is cloudy, it will not be noticeable. For example, on a cloudy night, the clouds will prevent the radiation of heat from the ground, hindering the formation of dew. In other words, the occurrence of dew is actually the water vapor in the air condensing on grass, trees, or other solid objects. Because on sunny and warm days, the water in rivers, ponds, and marshes evaporates at all times, so the atmosphere contains a lot of water vapor. At night, the heat absorbed by the ground surface and vegetation is gradually radiated out. This warm air comes into contact with the cold plants or ground, and it becomes drops of water, dew. However, the dew point also varies depending on the temperature. If the air containing water vapor is hot, it will condense into dew. If the dew point reaches below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, it will condense into frost. Moreover, there are other conditions for the formation of dew, which is that there should be no wind. If the wind is too strong, the air containing water vapor will be blown away. The relationship between dew and the growth of vegetation is very important. During rainless periods in summer, vegetation will not wither due to the moisture from dew. As mentioned above, dew turns into frost when the temperature drops. Because the temperature of an object drops below the freezing point, the air around it also cools down at the same time. In physics, this is called "saturation." If the air is saturated, even if the surrounding air drops below the freezing point, it will become solid, which is the reason for the formation of frost. In our country's climate, the temperature outside the Great Wall is colder than inside. In the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, frost generally begins to fall in September and October and does not disappear until March of the following year. According to the solar terms, there is the "White Dew" solar term, which means that the dew is beginning to fall. The "Cold Dew" solar term means that the weather is getting colder and colder. "Frost's Descent" means that dew is turning into frost. "Rain Water" means that the weather is gradually warming, and ice and snow are turning into rain water. Generally, after the Frost's Descent solar term, the sky is clear and the nights are cold, and the frost condenses whiter. If the temperature drops to below zero degrees Celsius, the water will freeze into ice. On cold mornings, we often see the dew on the tiles condensing into icicles, which is because the temperature of the dew has dropped below the freezing point.</p>

<h3>Financial Market Steady but Weak; Ordinary Process; No Change in Gold Market Results</h3>
<p>Agents Must Wear Armbands to the Market Starting Monday</p>
<p>The gold market initially strengthened and then weakened yesterday. The market sentiment remained mediocre, mainly because overseas silver and exchange markets shrunk again. London pure gold rose, but unfortunately, people's hearts were extremely uncertain, and the upward trend was difficult to sustain. As a result, it ended up at the same price as before, forming a largely consolidating pattern with ordinary trading volume. At the start of the morning, the overseas silver and English gold markets were shrinking, the Montedri forward silver market also fell, the exchange rate continued to decline, and London raw gold rose two and a half pence. The preliminary trading opened up and rose immediately, then rose to over three yuan. After the opening, the central bank announced the listing prices, both English and American, were flat, and the customs gold unit rose three mils, with the standard gold price at 1006 yuan. People's hearts were quite good, and it continued to rise. Banks poured out shillings, and after rising high, it fell again. However, because people's hearts were still stable, the market situation was stable in the end. The HSBC bank announced its listing prices, both English and American were flat and continued to consolidate. Afterwards, the banks actually covered up, and the people's hearts were originally bullish, but at this point, the buying boom suddenly rose, and the gold price rose again, but only temporarily. Supply increased at high prices, and the trend turned downwards again. The silver balance tax was announced unchanged, still taxing 6.25%. The English exchange rate was calculated at one shilling, five pence and seventy-five cents. Although there was consolidation in the middle, it still fell back. However, because major players were still entering at low prices, the situation was quite stable at this time, mainly because banks were trading against each other and the exchange market was still tight. However, major players supplied in succession, the exchange market slightly loosened, and a selling boom started. The psychology of those with floating profits wavered, and the lineup collapsed. At this point, trading in the market was oversupplied, and the 90 yuan level was finally broken. Unexpectedly, the situation changed drastically, and buyers came to resist at low prices again, rising back to over 90 yuan. Major players took the opportunity to enter, and Yang also came to buy strongly, stabilizing the market again. However, the noon closing was still weaker, as those getting rid of their holdings were more eager. The market situation in the morning initially rose and then fell, and the overall trend continued to be sluggish. The air in the market was not good, and rumors such as the central bank borrowing money had not been dispelled, so the upward trend was finally blocked. The spot market situation was slightly more active. Starting Monday, all market participants must wear armbands for trading. The market situation in the morning is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 993 yuan, 2.4 yuan higher than the previous closing. The central bank announced its listing prices, both English and American were flat, and the customs gold unit rose three mils, boosting people's confidence. Fuxing Yongyuan, Yigan Changxiang, and others entered, rising to 4.6 yuan. The Dalian gang, Fuyu Dadecheng, came to sell. Macalister released December shillings at 1975 and retreated to 2 yuan. Yifeng Yongyuan, Yiyuan Maoyong, entered, rising to 4 yuan. The HSBC listing prices were expected, and both English and American were flat. At this time, people's hearts were very stable, struggling around the 3 yuan mark. Dadecheng, Richang Qingyu, and Yifeng Yong slightly sold, and it dropped to 2.5 yuan. Jiaotong covered up January shillings at 1875. Hongli entered and suddenly stabilized. Later, Yuanchang Yong, Zhaofeng Changhengxing, and others competed to buy, pushing it up to 5.5 yuan. Fuxing Yong, Dadecheng, the Dalian gang, Yuansheng Yong, Richang Hengyu, and Hengxing jointly unloaded their holdings. The balance tax was announced unchanged. Although there was consolidation, it still retreated to 2.6 yuan. At this time, Dafa Yong and Fuxing Yong came to enter at low prices, rising to 3.6 yuan, which was quite stable. Dingkang Fuchang, Hengyu, Hengchang Yong, and Tongchun sold out, gradually falling to 90 yuan. Although Yuan Maoyong and Yifeng Yong entered to 1.3 yuan, because Hengchang Yong, Dafa Yong, and Hengyu still came to sell small amounts, the psychology of small holders was unsustainable, and the lineup collapsed, falling to 88.6 yuan. Dafa Yong, Fuxing Yong, Dadecheng, and Hongxing successively provided supplies. Although the banks were still blocking December shillings at 3125, because Yang was buying strongly, Hongxing was the most eager to buy in the market, gradually rising back to 91.7 yuan. The Dalian gang and Hengxing came to sell, and the noon closing fell again to 990.6 yuan. After the closing, Fuxing Yong, Yongli Fuyu, and others continuously supplied, and it retreated into the 90 yuan range. In the half day, the highest price was 995.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 988.6 yuan, a fluctuation of 6.9 yuan. As a result, it was more stable than the previous closing.</p>
<p>The settlement price was raised to 1006 yuan due to the central bank's standard gold price listing, about 15 yuan higher than the closing price, and 1 yuan higher than the previous</p>
<p>closing. The registered price for this month was 982 yuan, January 9919, morning water replenishment 982 yuan, bare gold标计991 yuan, 2 yuan lower than the standard gold price. Although there were few spot transactions, the foreign interest rate had retreated to 3.5 yuan, and the silver capital was relaxed. Therefore, Tianjin goods were priced at 2 yuan above the standard gold price. This was because public orders had already started sales activities. The swap spread was offered by Qian Changxiang to Yingfeng Heng at 35 units of 9.2 yuan, December strips. After a large number of spot goods were released, only 105 strips remained. A total of nine buyers: Qingfayong, Ruikang Yuanyi, Futai Heng, Hengyu Yingfeng Heng, Hengxing Dingkang, and Daxingyong. There were three sellers: Qian Changxiang, Shenkang and Dafeng Heng.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was still mediocre. In summary, Hongxing Yuanmaoyong Dingtaiyicheng Dafayong Dachangxiang Xianghe Fuxingyong Tianfeng Hengtai Hengchangyong Yuanchangyong Yuanyi and others were on the buying side. Fuyu Yuanshengyong Yongli Yifengyong Yongdefutai Hengyu Richang Fuantongfu Shunli Wanxing and others were on the selling side. Dadecheng Yifengyong first sold and then entered. Hengchangyong Qianchangxiang first entered and then exited. The Dalian gang Wanxing did more than 400 units in total and netted out more than 100 units. Shunli did more than 400 units in total and netted out more than 100 units. Guangbang Shengda still had little activity. Hengxing also did not see huge transactions, slightly selling after netting out. The total number of transactions on the day was 32,564 units.</p>
<p>The January futures lineup included more than 2,800 units for bulls, 1,800 units for Fuchang, and nearly 1,700 units each for Dachangxiang and Yuanmaoyong. Changshengyong had more than 1,200 units, and Wanxing Shunmao Dadecheng each had more than 1,000 units.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Market Shows Near-Low and Far-High Trend</h3>
<p>96 Bonds Fall Alone by 6 Jiao Due to Rumors of Trading Ban</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was relatively stable. However, unreasonable rumors about the 96 Bonds arose again, claiming that they would no longer be traded on the market. Such absurd remarks are even more misleading than talks of reorganization. Some speculators, influenced by these rumors, rushed to sell, causing the price of 96 Bonds to decline gradually amidst the general rise in other bonds, creating a divergent trend. This was entirely based on unsubstantiated rumors and self-inflicted panic. Other bonds rose due to the easing of offshore interest rates and the sharp drop in overnight lending rates, but because they had already risen significantly in the past few days, the momentum of the rise had weakened. The overall environment was positive, with Wang Chonghui and Sun Ke's visit to Hong Kong increasing hopes for greater unity. However, the monetary situation may not ease significantly, so the outlook may temporarily see consolidation. Yesterday was Saturday, so trading decreased slightly. The market was stable with a firm undertone. The opening was slightly firm by two or three jiao in the morning, then slightly weak by two or three jiao later. Buying was for the 16th and selling for the 11th, and secondary trading uniformly returned to looseness by five fen, one jiao, to three jiao. All bonds showed a trend of higher prices for distant maturities and lower prices for near maturities, which was certainly not good for bullish investors. In the afternoon, overnight lending rates eased significantly, but due to the need to clear positions on Saturday, market prices turned upward by two or three jiao. The closing was somewhat chaotic, with both ups and downs of two or three jiao. However, rumors suddenly arose about 96 Bonds in the afternoon, causing a fall of half a yuan, which can be considered an unwarranted disaster. The overall results showed continued gains of five fen, one jiao, to three and a half jiao, with one or two bonds showing slight declines. However, 96 Bonds fell by as much as six jiao. The total trading volume was approximately 20 million yuan. The results of the price changes are listed in the table below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>American Speculator Still Away</h3>
<p>丨Stock Trading Extremely Quiet</p>
<p>Xinfeng Trading Company reports that yesterday (30th), the New York stock market felt firm, with steel, aviation, automobile, and tobacco stocks showing particular strength. However, because speculators were celebrating Thanksgiving and had not returned, trading was extremely quiet. The bond market was mixed, with foreign public bonds performing well. The small exchange fluctuated. The total daily trading volume was 800,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Auction Sentiment Inclines to Softness</h3>
<p>Buyers Still Spreading Rumors of Deliveries</p>
<p>Japanese Short Sellers Remain Calm</p>
<p>The yarn market is quiet. The decline in foreign cotton and the sluggish retail sales of spot yarn have softened sentiment. However, a certain company's stance is extremely firm, and there are rumors that it will still take delivery of December contracts, so new sellers are wary. However, the Japanese short positions</p>
<p>remain calm. Inland factories are selling short at high prices in distant months.</p>
<h3>Gold Rooster Loosens</h3>
<p>The opening of the cotton yarn auction market was soft. The decline in foreign cotton downstream and the lack of buyers in the market caused prices to fall by two, three, four, six, and seven jiao in various months. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were relatively clear. A total of only 600 bales were traded. However, bulls in the current month are holding tight and not letting go, causing prices to rise by one jiao. Distant months fell by one, three, and four jiao. The total daily trading volume was 26,600 bales. Sales included 850 bales by Dafeng, 650 bales by Yuanda, 1,000 bales by Gengfeng, 1,800 bales by Junchang, 500 bales by Renfeng, 700 bales by Yichang, 1,900 bales by Changfeng, and 550 bales by Xingda.

<h3>Indian Cotton Triggers a Downturn in Cotton Auction</h3>
<p>The cotton market is weak. The sharp decline in Indian cotton, coupled with unchanged exchange rates and a slight drop in gold prices, has dampened sentiment. Some bulls are liquidating, but most are psychologically inclined to buy. However, Tongcheng Company's large position is being released gradually.</p>
<h3>Zheng Cotton Falls Back by Three to Four Jiao</h3>
<p>The cotton auction market opened with a sudden decline, showing a rather weak outlook. The sharp decline of four and a half rupees in Indian cotton, coupled with slightly weaker gold prices, triggered a selling wave. Most bulls liquidated, causing prices to fall by three to four jiao in all months. The market remained weak after the opening in the afternoon. After two or three rounds of bidding, some short covering led to a slight rebound, resulting in price changes of five fen. The total daily trading volume was 110,300 dan. Sales included 1,000 dan by Meiji, 1,200 dan by Yuanda, 1,600 dan by Zhenda, 2,900 dan by Gengfeng, 1,500 dan by Junchang, 6,200 dan by Yuanda, 1,100 dan by Changyu, 1,800 dan by Chong'an, 2,900 dan by Xincheng, 1,300 dan by Deji, 3,100 dan by Yuanxingchang, 2,800 dan by Runkang, 1,500 dan by Xinheng, and 1,100 dan by Ruiyuan.

<h3>Slight Rise and Fall in Yarn and Cotton Grades</h3>
<p>丨Special Margin Increased for New Trades in Current Month Cotton丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange convened a cotton grading meeting on November 27 for the purpose of grading cotton for delivery in May 24th Year. The result of the grading was an increase of 1.5 to 2 yuan for the first grade of upland cotton. The remaining second, third, and fourth grades remained unchanged, the same as the April contracts. The revised grade prices for the first grade are listed below (for reference):</p>
<p>▲First Grade Old Price New Price</p>
<p>Grade A Add 8 yuan Add 10 yuan</p>
<p>Grade B Add 5.5 yuan Add 7 yuan</p>
<p>Grade C Add 4.5 yuan Add 6 yuan</p>
<p>Grade D Add 3.5 yuan Add 5 yuan</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Cotton Yarn Review Committee convened a grading meeting on November 26 for the purpose of grading substitute goods for delivery in May 24th Year. The results showed no changes for the second grade of 10s and 16s cotton yarn, the same as the April contracts. However, the 20s Golden Pagoda yarn produced by Chongming Fuan Factory, which was discounted by 5 yuan from the standard grade in April contracts, is now increased by 2 yuan for delivery in May contracts, with a discount of only 3 yuan from the standard grade. There were no other changes to the 20s yarn.</p>
<p>The Chinese Merchants Yarn and Cloth Exchange will increase the special margin by 2 yuan per dan for new trades in December contracts made from December 1st onwards. Both parties storing accounts will be charged, and this has already been announced.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Prices Quite Firm</h3>
<p>丨Stockpiled Cotton Amounts to Five Million Bales丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to a lack of major buyers and unfavorable news from Liverpool. Later, it rebounded because sentiment favored retaining the Peek-Hayden plan and there was improved demand for spot goods and cloth. Mills purchased a total of 32,500 bales last week, so some traders bought back and recovered. Spot goods fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 2 to 12 points. English cotton spot goods fell by 7 points, and futures were unchanged. Indian cotton initially firmed due to purchases by retail investors and brokers, then softened due to sales by European exporters and speculators. Pingguoer fell by 3.5 rupees, Aomula fell by 4.5 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 2.75 rupees. The original telegram is listed below (dated 30th):</p>

<p>A telegram from New York on November 30th reports on the cotton market situation for the week:</p>
<p>The cotton market was more active this week. Traders and brokers made some purchases, causing prices to rise gradually. There is a positive outlook for general commerce, and there are hopes for increased export demand. This is also a reason for the slight rise in cotton prices. In addition, news from Washington that there are negotiations with Germany and Russia to buy cotton has strengthened sentiment. As prices rose, spot cotton sales increased slightly, but hedging by southern sellers remained relatively limited. Futures buyers were not aggressive, believing that if prices rise further, some of the cotton currently stockpiled by the government with borrowed funds will definitely be sold, and industry demand will be limited to what they urgently need. Furthermore, new cotton for early delivery is currently being sold at a discount, as it is expected that cotton production will increase next year and prices will loosen further. According to Washington reports, cotton held by cotton farmer cooperatives and stockpiled as collateral for government loans amounts to approximately five million bales.</p>
<p>Rumors of Production Cuts in Flour Mills</p>
<h3>Futures Flour Soars by More Than Four Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market presented an initial flat and then rising trend in the morning after opening. Foreign wheat quotations from Chicago fell slightly by about two jiao and four fen, and from Canada by about four jiao and eight fen. At the opening, because of the foreign wheat quotations, the price for the current month once fell slightly, as low as four jiao and four fen. However, after this weak period, the market trend presented a steady upward price trend. In the current month, because of active spot sales, the Nanyang group continued to be active, and the Northern group also made purchases. According to reports from various factories, due to insufficient raw materials, some factories will have to reduce production, so the buying interest was particularly strong, and the market conditions were unusually favorable, exceeding the initial opening price by four fen in the near term and two fen in the distant term. When it came to the afternoon opening, the near-term sentiment remained good, as spot sales were very active, and factories also slightly recovered their positions, resulting in tighter and tighter purchases. The closing price surged to the five-jiao mark. Given the shortage of raw materials, there is little hope for a near-term pullback. As a result, the current month soared by four fen and two and a half li, January rose by four fen and seven and a half li, February and March rose by three fen and two and a half li, April rose by two fen and seven li, and May opened at five jiao and eight fen, with the closing price also rising by one fen and seven li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Also Follows Flour Prices and Turns Higher</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market generally presented a stable situation in the morning after opening. Foreign wheat quotations from Chicago were lower by about two jiao and four fen, and from Canada by about four jiao and eight fen. Although foreign wheat prices were slightly lower at the opening, the market trend was stable because of the thin selling pressure in the market. The distant term also presented a generally stable situation due to very few sellers. When it came to the afternoon opening, the rising flour market, coupled with the unabated rumors of tax increases, caused the buying interest to turn active, and the market trend was also good. Given the wheat needs of various factories in this city, it will be necessary to continue ordering foreign wheat in the future to provide relief, but the import tax is too high, causing factories to hesitate. As a result, the current month rose by three fen, January rose by five fen, February rose by five fen, and March rose by seven fen. In the spot wheat market, sales have been active, and asking prices have continued to improve by three to four fen. Shandong Demai is offered at 3.945 yuan, Zhengyangguan wheat at 3.93 yuan, Haizhou Xuzhou Mingguang wheat at 3.90 yuan, and Yaowan wheat at 3.94 yuan. Fuxin took 8,000 bags, and Shenda took 3,000 bags.</p>
<p>The Chicago wheat market seems to be consolidating. Sellers are eager to sell when prices rise, and factories are currently purchasing. There are many shorts among speculators in the market, due to rain domestically and weak foreign markets.</p>

<h3>After the Amendment of the Criminal Law on Adultery?</h3>
<p>— 29</p>
<p>The new criminal law only punishes married women who commit adultery, and does not punish married men who commit adultery with others. This caused a great uproar for a long time. Finally, the Legislative Yuan amended it the other day to "Those who have a spouse and commit adultery with others shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one year or less; the same shall apply to those who commit adultery with them." After this, it can be considered a grand finale. In this law, we can no longer find traces of gender inequality.</p>
<p>However, what is closely related to our women is reality, not law; the key to relieving women's suffering is economy, not empty words. The provision that men and women are completely equal in law in the Republic of China did not begin today; however, women are still treated like cattle and horses, as before.</p>
<p>The Chinese nation has always liked to talk only about the surface: In the past, during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song Dynasty, as long as the Liao people were willing to call us brothers, we were willing to secretly send them 100,000 taels of silver and 200,000 bolts of silk every year. This ugly weakness has not yet been eliminated, and of course women's psychology also has it. Therefore, after this amendment to the adultery law, some people may think that men and women are already equal, and feel very honored; then they are really fools!</p>
<p>Women do not have the knowledge to live independently, nor the opportunity (occupation) to live independently. They rely solely on their sexual organs for clothing, food, and support for the elderly and children. How can they bear the protection of the law? Considering the increasingly chaotic social situation, the number of married men who need other people's wives and daughters to satisfy their lust may not be much more than the number of married women who need other men to provide them with clothing and food. Then, even if this adultery law can be equally enforced, a large number of married women who commit adultery with others for excusable reasons, and men who are indeed guilty of licentiousness, receive the same punishment, which is already a great injustice. Moreover, in today's society where women rely on men for a living, how many can accuse their husbands of adultery?</p>
<p>Men and women are not equal in thought and habits, so education cannot be equal, and occupations cannot be equal. It is a common fact that middle-class families would rather send a stupid son to university than send a smart daughter to middle school. It is also a common fact that various institutions would rather use superficial and arrogant men than steadfast and prudent women. In various factories, no matter how capable female workers are, their wages are always less than half of those of male workers, which is also a very obvious fact. If these facts are not resolved, equal laws are just empty promises for women.</p>
<p>We would like to raise the question of what will happen after the amendment of the criminal law on adultery? We would like to hear the high opinions of those who are determined to improve the status of women!</p>
<h3>Written After the Revision of Article "239" of the Criminal Law</h3>
<p>— Guo Zhenyi</p>
<p>Article 239 of the new criminal law, after fierce opposition from the women's community, has now been reconsidered by the Legislative Yuan: restoring the original amendment: "Those who have a spouse and commit adultery with others shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one year or less; the same shall apply to those who commit adultery with them." This time, the women's struggle for the law has come to such a conclusion, which can be considered satisfactory. However, there are even more important laws than this that we must continue to struggle to have deleted and revised.</p>
<p>If, due to economic development and the resulting public social interaction between men and women, freedom of marriage and divorce, and the relationship between the sexes is completely established on the basis of the necessity of cohabitation and conscious will, there is no need for laws at all. If laws are needed to regulate the relationship between husband and wife, then the feelings between husband and wife have long disappeared.</p>
<p>However, in the current environment in which women find themselves, men, with their superior economic and social status and thousands of years of customs, consider adultery by men to be nothing, while adultery by women is considered a heinous crime. Although it is clear that this law does not greatly benefit the facts, women have at least obtained the equal punishment for the crime of adultery stipulated in the law. If it were not for relieving a layer of oppression on women in this畸形 society, it would not be better to completely abolish this law.</p>
<p>Now that Article 239 has come to an end, it seems that no one is concerned about Article 221. According to Article 221, it is only a crime to seduce a girl under the age of fourteen. Most of the victims are households below the middle class in big cities. We should pay more attention to ensuring the safety of weak underage girls and request that the original text of sixteen years of age be changed.</p>
<p>In addition, Article 1123, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Code: "Even if they are not relatives, those who cohabit as a family for the purpose of permanent common life shall be regarded as family members." Because the Civil Code does not have the status of concubines, this article recognizes the existence of concubines, and we should also oppose it.</p>
<p>More importantly, the Women's Labor Law urgently needs to be improved: to enable poor women to engage in occupations without being unilaterally sacrificed by employers. Therefore, the government should be requested to formulate labor laws, such as the number of days of maternity leave before and after childbirth, wage increases (usually much lower than male workers), and the abolition or shortening of night work hours, all of which should be clearly stipulated and effectively implemented.</p>
<p>Based on the legacy of the Prime Minister and the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China, the equality of women in law does not need to be requested again and again. If the results of this movement are to be more satisfactory, it is necessary to achieve the goals of deleting, revising and improving the above-mentioned criminal law, civil law, and women's labor law at a minimum.</p>
<h3>Where Have the Educated Women Gone?</h3>
<p>— Guan Lu</p>
<p>The women's liberation movement against the feudal system has been advocated for many years. Generally speaking, this movement has achieved considerable results: marriages of "parents' orders and matchmakers' words" have been broken, and the doctrines of "men and women should not touch each other" and "lack of talent in a woman is a virtue" have been torn down. In the past, women in deep boudoirs who did not leave their homes and did not learn to read and write are now carrying schoolbags to school. From childhood to adulthood to marriage, many women have been exposed to the time of university. In school faculty lounges, hospitals, banks and companies, and all other stores and institutions, there are already many female service workers.</p>
<p>Of course, the women's issues we are talking about now only refer to these educated intellectual women, and do not include the vast number of manual labor women who cannot even afford primary school education, because that issue is too big.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about intellectual women. Can we get the answer from the phenomena mentioned above: the women's liberation movement has achieved results, women have been liberated, and women are equal to men?</p>
<p>I am afraid that this answer will not be believed by a woman who currently has a high-level occupation, if she is aware. Let's take a look at the way out for many intellectual women.</p>
<p>As far as educated women are concerned, apart from women who have received education below the middle level, let's just look at women who have received university education. On average, the number of female students in each university almost accounts for 10% of the total. Of course, this 10% of female students is pitiful compared to men, but let's just look at the average number in each school and compare it with the number of professional women in various institutions. What is the difference? Moreover, the number of professional women is limited, and schools send out a batch of old students and recruit a batch of new students every year. Of course, the number of professional women cannot only be based on those who are in school. Then, where have the large number of educated women gone, except for a few who have been assigned to serve in various schools and institutions? From childhood to adulthood to marriage, after finishing four years of university or less, where have the women used the homework they have done for "ten years of hard study", and who have they given the gains from the laboratory and library to? There is no question that the result of this women's liberation movement is to liberate a large number of women in deep boudoirs who have received "foolish people" education from families of firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea, and after completing several years of equal education for men and women, they are sent back to their old homes to be a new type of "good wife and loving mother"!</p>
<p>Of course, women of "good wife and loving mother" ideology are not what women want to be themselves. It is not that women are unwilling to look for jobs and participate in social activities, and would rather be a housewife who depends on others for a living and is regarded as an appreciation object and an exclusive "prostitute", but that in this way of life, women cannot liberate themselves from the shackles of family life, cannot avoid the special tasks of being a wife and a mother, and cannot but cause obstacles to social activities due to these special tasks. It can be said that the current women's problem in China is not just the panic of unemployment, but how to serve even if they have a job!</p>
<p>Here, we cannot but think of a problem, that is, the family problem, which is most related to the women's problem, is the problem that makes the women's problem difficult to solve, and it is not just the family but the entire social system. In a system that cannot make women economically independent and cannot make women become professional women and social women, occasionally a few women have a job - those who are mostly unemployed are not really doing nothing and being supported by others, but are actually engaged in another occupation: that is, being a slave and selling themselves to specific people - this kind of fortunate occupation does not rely on their knowledge and ability; not every intellectual woman can get it, and it cannot be maintained forever until tomorrow. "Good wife and loving mother" is the general route of their destination, and the general scope of their activities and vitality; unless she always embraces celibacy, does not want to have a marriage test, and wants to be forever young, forever attractive, and forever able to make people laugh.</p>
<p>Our conclusion on the past women's movement is only for women who have received the highest education: that kind of women's movement has not liberated women, and the many feudal oppressions imposed on women have not been eliminated. In the intellectual women under so many years of women's liberation movement, what they have is, in addition to the oppression of the feudal system, also the enlarged earrings imported from capitalist countries, and the newly translated contracts of trampling; the total of the two things added together is Western-style "modern" and oriental "quiet". This is the artificial intellectual women stereotype.</p>
<p>Finally, we must understand that the task of our intellectual women is not to use humorous articles and witty language to laugh at ourselves and others. Our task is to resist the masters and systems that create stereotypes for these women, to resist this typical life of women; to find out in society those intellectual women who have lost their踪跡, to create knowledge for those uneducated women, and to seek liberation for all unliberated women!</p>
<h3>Bread and Coffee</h3>
<p>— Zijing</p>
<p>One day, the poet ×× excitedly talked about his views on love in middle age with his friends ×××, who had wives and children. He said, "Since he got married! There have been about more than one hundred love affairs. He has lovers who are middle school students, university students, beautiful, ugly, big, small, old, and young. He has also lost love almost one hundred times, but he is not sad at all, and he doesn't care at all. Because middle-aged people have wives, falling in love again is like drinking 'coffee.' It is okay to drink a few cups of 'coffee' when you are free, and of course it is okay to drink a little more, but you don't have to drink it. If you get it in your hand and it is snatched away by others, you don't have to be sad and cry. Anyway, this is 'coffee' for leisure······. The wife is different, the wife is like 'bread,' this 'bread' that sustains life cannot be lacking. Therefore, if the wife understands this, she can let her man go out and play, drink a few cups of 'coffee' to moisten his throat and embellish his life."</p>
<p>After the poet finished speaking, a green, cynical smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. Everyone in the room admired his brilliant insights and laughed non-stop.</p>
<p>The general cynical middle-aged man represented by this poet at this time seems to be standing naked in the sun. They have a well-behaved wife at home who serves as their accountant, tailor, cook, purchasing agent, nanny, and maid, and a machine for venting their sexual desire. Everything is arranged comfortably for them. Their husbands think this is common "food," this is "bread." They cannot be satisfied with just this "bread." When they are free, they want to go out and play, breathe some fresh air, and drink a cup of "coffee." They hold a living stick in their arms. So there are those young female students and women with weak wills who are seduced by them and placed in "coffee" cups. They can temporarily quench their thirst, heal their loneliness, and cure their temporary madness.</p>
<p>On the top of the green mountains, on the bank of the green water, in the bustling amusement park, in the quiet park, in Beiping, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Hankou, Tianjin,······all big cities, famous scenic spots, and scenic areas, you can often see some decent gentlemen in Western suits with a "living stick" hanging on their arms. This is their "coffee" for leisure.</p>
<p>Living sticks, coffee for leisure! The living demons close to you are really vipers and scorpions, beasts that will kill your spirituality and destroy your happiness!</p>
<p>But society can only destroy you, not help you. Laws that benefit only one party cannot protect you! Especially the tolerant and generous newly revised laws, which allow girls as young as fourteen to be placed in leisure coffee cups. This will surely be smiled and respectfully accepted by middle-aged men like Poet ××. Sisters, you can't rely on others for anything, sweep away your dependence like a pile of dust. Quickly awaken yourselves, wake up yourselves, and stand up to be a human being!</p>

<h3>Photographs of Brothel Streets in Guilin Special Zone</h3>

<h3>The Marriage of Di Sun</h3>
<p>— Bai Shi</p>
<p>For three years I hadn't been to the lakeside road, and my heart felt strangely empty. This year, when the crabs were fat and the chrysanthemums were vibrant, I escaped the constraints of my busy life and quietly returned to that old place of dreams. To first win the favor of the lake and mountains, I didn't notify a single old friend. I hurried to the lake while the setting sun was still on the mountain peaks, and set sail into the heart of the lake; the willows of Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, swaying gently, indicated that they still recognized me. Returning from Xinghua Village along the inner lake, it was already a time of wearing stars and moon; all sounds were silent, with specks of light accompanying a lake of bright moon. Suddenly, from the depths of the woods, came the sound of recitation, which felt somewhat familiar, so I strolled closer and heard the person reading Zhu Shuzhen's "Autumn Night" poem:</p>
<p>"Sleepless long into the night, the autumn air is clear,</p>
<p>The candle flower trimmed again, the third watch is near,</p>
<p>The bed is spread, coolness fills with wutong moon,</p>
<p>The moon is bright where the wutong is broken soon."</p>
<p>This distinctly familiar voice filled my heart with melancholy, yet her name was scattered beyond my memory. After a moment of stillness, in the pale red gauze window, a low, large head was reflected, instantly awakening my memory; I didn't wait for her to finish the lines, "To claim no home, and vainly seek a groom, With only shadows, one leans on kin for doom," and went straight to knock on her front door. Inside, a dog barked, "Woof woof woof woof," Di Sun, standing by the window upstairs, knew and ignored me. Knowing this was not the way to call at the door in the middle of the night, I loudly called out her name. She exclaimed, "Ah!" and ran downstairs, taking my hands and beginning to weep on the steps.</p>
<p>For three years we had lost contact, which is common for wandering people, but I didn't expect Di Sun's appearance to have changed so much. Before, she was dark and plump, but now she was sallow and thin. Only her short stature, which hadn't diminished, vaguely reminded me of the person from before. I couldn't find the most appropriate words to say, and in her newly furnished room, I remained silent for a long time before asking, "Di Sun! What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"I'm married!" she answered with sobs. I knew that the most heartbreaking thing for many women was the issue of marriage, and it was best to avoid mentioning it, lest it reignite their pain. But Di Sun refused to remain silent; she sobbed for a while and began to say:</p>
<p>"Bai Shi! Life is like a dream, and marriage is the nightmare in the dream! But when you wake up from a dream, everything can be restored, while for us, there is no turning back! Everything is completely destroyed! It's like a comet colliding with a planet, both are shattered! ... Actually, it's only been a year, a short year! A year ago, although he was so thin and lanky, he didn't have 'treachery' written all over him; although I was so plump and short, I wasn't a soulless piece of flesh. But now, we're both finished! When I see him, I often think of his thin, dark hands, which are unclean, unclean; when he sees me, he certainly thinks even worse, more terribly, because he hates me ten times as much! You know, I was over thirty and never romantic, why? I never dreamed of living a fickle life, but he treats me as being less valuable than a goddess's life, even more unseemly, even less worthy of living with him, how can I bear it?"</p>
<p>Her immersion in sorrow and grief reminded me of many past events. Four years ago, when her close friend Shao Lan got married, she didn't smile for an entire month. She lay on her pillow all day, rarely seeing the light of day. Such a sentimental and resentful person could not withstand a broken heart. I used to joke with her that if she ever got married, she must choose someone whose personality was similar to hers. So, I suddenly had a suitable question to ask her, to interrupt her sorrowful thoughts.</p>
<p>"Who introduced you? What kind of person is he?"</p>
<p>"He is someone you know, and no one introduced him; he came to me himself."</p>
<p>"Who on earth is it?" I asked again.</p>
<p>"Li Yu!" she dragged out with a mournful tone.</p>
<p>"Li Yu!" I repeated in my mind, and immediately a pale, thin, young man's figure appeared. Heavens! What a mistake this was! This aloof, haggard young man, what did he have to receive Di Sun's fire-like warmth, silk-like tenderness, and deep affection?</p>
<p>"He came to see me twice when I was sick," Di Sun began to recount their story. "Later, he had someone ask me if I was a committed bachelor. I replied that I wasn't. A week later, he invited me to go boating on the lake; on the boat, he suddenly asked me: if we were to collaborate, would there be any problems. If someone else had said these words to me haltingly, I would have pondered it over and over, and wouldn't have been able to answer for three to five days. But it was him, a person who doesn't usually speak much; when he asked this, I assumed he had already considered everything: my age, my unattractive appearance, my deep emotions... he should have been familiar with all of these, having worked together for four or five years. Since he didn't have any problems, of course I couldn't think of any big issues; although I was a bit worried about finances, my mother still had some savings, so I couldn't find a reason to refuse at the time. Soon, the spring vacation arrived, and I went home to pick up my mother, to jointly handle this matter: before leaving, I entrusted him to withdraw a soon-to-expire deposit from a money house on my behalf. When my mother and I arrived in Hangzhou, there were only three days left until the wedding date; three days passed easily, and on that day, just as the wedding guests had dispersed, he asked me how to handle the accounting, and I was at a loss for words. Besides that deposit, my mother and I had no other liquid cash. Fortunately, he took care of everything; before long, he had returned to the room relaxed. The furnishings in the room, from the fresh flowers to the floor, all radiated warmth and vibrancy; but when I greeted him, his face was as white and cold as a silver dollar. I held this cold stove for three days, shivering all the time. After three days, he kicked off and went to school, and from then on, we became completely estranged; not just estranged, but even more estranged than if we had no previous connection. Until now, more than a year later, I only have some joy when I see him in my dreams. I also know that marriages often break down, but I never imagined it would happen so quickly to me. I painstakingly planted a flower, not to mention that it didn't bloom, it didn't even sprout a single leaf, what was it all for? ... My health is already like this now, and I don't want to say anything else; I just want to know: why did he want to marry me? This is a question I will keep asking until I go to the Yellow Springs....” Saying this, she covered her face again.</p>
<p>I tried my best to comfort her, pulled her to the window to look at the moon, and took her for a walk in the courtyard. After she felt better, I bid her farewell. The boat girl who had come with me was already asleep at the door. I loudly woke her up, and a forest bird, startled, flew towards the heart of the lake. For some reason, I suddenly felt that it was the shadow of Li Yu. It flew to the water to eat fish, it flew to the mountains to eat fruit, having absolute freedom; although the fish and fruit could be lured to him, they could not keep him. Perhaps Di Sun's tragedy lies here: even now, there are paths in life open for men, and small constraints cannot hold back their footsteps.</p>
<p>A light white mist drifted on the lake, and the willow branches swept the sunken moon in the water; in this dreamlike old place, I encountered the first dreamlike old friend.</p>

<h3>Professional Activities and Worldview</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>If we say that everyone has their own worldview, everyone might feel that this is a bit of an exaggeration, right? Because worldview refers to a philosophical system or concept regarding the ultimate meaning of life, and most people hardly understand any philosophy. If we say that everyone has their own worldview, isn't this an exaggeration? Moreover, making worldviews too diverse is also very unscientific. Because if everyone has a different worldview, wouldn't this make the worldview that is manifested as social thought extremely chaotic? Can it still be considered a system of social thought?</p>
<p>In fact, that is indeed the case. Not only does each individual have a worldview, but this does not prevent the establishment of a worldview as a system of social thought. Because although individual worldviews are manifested in society in infinite numbers, there are many groups in society composed of the majority of people with roughly the same status and environment, so these certain social groups have their common worldview. Moreover, in each specific era of history, there is also a specific worldview of that era, different from the worldview of other eras. This is a fact that social scientists have already proven. The diversity of individual worldviews does not hinder the establishment of a worldview as a system of social thought because individual worldviews differ slightly from the social worldviews of a certain group and a certain society, but they also have a great similarity to the social worldviews of a certain group and a certain society. The worldview of a certain group and a certain society is a general system formed by extracting from individual worldviews, so individual worldviews contain social worldviews, and social worldviews also contain individual worldviews. This, from the perspective of logic, is the logical principle that the "general" includes the "particular," and the "particular" also includes the "general."</p>
<p>Why do human worldviews have such complex diversity? The fundamental key lies in the fact that all human conceptual forms are not innate. Individuals, social groups, and societies all have their specific living environments, certain living conditions, and certain social statuses of individuals and social groups, etc. This influences or directly produces their thoughts and forms their worldviews. Worldview is a conceptual expression of human social status and living conditions, and it is based on actual life.</p>
<p>Once we understand the above reasons, it becomes easy to understand and explain the connection between professional activities and worldview. Because of their occupational activities, the living conditions of laborers in certain professions, their economic living conditions, and even their social status are different, so the actual facts reflect and determine their worldview and even their cosmology. This fact and phenomenon have been fully demonstrated in ancient human history. People in the hunting and gathering era, because they engaged in the professional activity of hunting animals all day long, painted various animals on the walls of their stone caves, expressing their worldview and cosmology through those arts, believing that animals were the only things worth paying attention to, and even worshiping animals, regarding animals as sacred. Agricultural residents are unaware of the vastness of the world and society, and their thoughts only focus on the abundance or deficiency of the year, and the growth and maturity of crops. The life happiness and pain they recognize only lie in the fullness or scarcity of the harvest. Their profession relies on natural seasons, weather, wind, rain, sunlight, etc., so they not only are superstitious about the gods of wind, rain, sun, moon, and stars, etc., but also entrust their fate to these natural objects, forming a worldview of accepting fate.</p>
<p>In modern society, workers, for example, work in cities and factories, and all changes in weather are irrelevant to them, so they do not have the worldview and cosmology of farmers. Moreover, they use their own power to control machines and utilize great electric power, steam power, fire power, water power, etc., so they know that nature is not mysterious and that human power is great, which forms their special worldview. In addition, those who engage in commercial activities have a worldview centered on markets, value, making money, and losing capital; intellectual laborers regard the pursuit and acquisition of knowledge, scholarship, and philosophical exploration of the origins of the universe and life as the most noble and interesting things in life, while merchants, industrialists, etc. often regard intellectual laborers as insignificant. All of these fully demonstrate that individuals and various social groups have different worldviews due to the different scope of their professional activities.</p>

<p>Investigation of Various Industries</p>
<h3>Nanyang Booksellers</h3>
<p>— Hai Qiu</p>
<p>Talking about the situation of the book industry in Nanyang is a very interesting thing. Generally speaking, Nanyang is relatively backward in terms of culture. Although the cultural undertakings of overseas Chinese have developed considerably, they are still far behind the cultural standards of major cities in mainland China. This is reflected in the situation of the book industry in Nanyang.</p>
<p>Most of the books in Nanyang are wholesale from Shanghai. What kind of books sell best in Nanyang? This is probably what you, the readers, want to ask. We know that most of the young students in Nanyang who are able to go to university have to run back to their home country to find their knowledge in universities in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Shanghai, and other places; the need for university-level books is almost equal to zero, needless to say. Although medium-level books sell better, they are still limited due to the limited number of buyers and subject to various restrictions by the local government, so naturally, there is no way to talk about much business. The most needed and best-selling are entertainment old novels, picture books with illustrations to increase interest, and other picture books, as well as popular knowledge books that guide daily life, such as "Daily Handbook," "Ask No One for Anything," and "Complete Manual of Abacus Instruction." In addition, there is also a considerable need for the Four Books and Five Classics and superstitious talismans. Most of these books are lithographed and thread-bound.</p>
<p>There is a bookstore in Shanghai that specializes in wholesale business to the mainland and various ports in Nanyang. I had the opportunity to visit this bookstore once by chance, and I also saw the catalog of books that Nanyang booksellers wholesale from them. A long side room, a parlor, with bookshelves on all four walls filled with all kinds of thread-bound lithographed books of different sizes, is the deepest impression that this bookstore gave me. Nanyang booksellers call these thread-bound books "old books," and call speculative books such as "Q&amp;A of Common Knowledge of Various Subjects," "Guide to Entrance Exams of Various Subjects," "×× Basics," "×× Get Through in 100 Days," etc., which are western-style typeset books, "new books." Books related to the New Culture are naturally also in the category of "new books."</p>
<p>These "old books" are mostly very cheap. Some cost three to five cents each, some cost three to five jiao each, and very few cost more than one yuan each. The bookstore wholesales them to them, mostly at an 80% discount after the actual price.</p>
<p>Don't look down on these books being worthless, buying more of them can still amount to a considerable business. The wholesale book price of several hundred yuan is a small amount, and a thousand or several hundred yuan is not considered much. For books that sell well, such as popular books for daily use, "Investiture of the Gods," "Romance of the Eastern Zhou Dynasties," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Journey to the West," "Water Margin," "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants," "The Biography of Ji Gong," "Flowers in the Mirror," etc. in old novels, booksellers wholesale at least one hundred to two hundred copies. Other books that sell less well are wholesaled at fifty, thirty, ten, or five copies depending on the quantity needed. The names of these books are too numerous to mention here one by one.</p>
<p>Nanyang booksellers not only wholesale books in Shanghai but also wholesale writing brushes and inksticks in Shanghai. Various ports in Nanyang mostly love to sell old brands. Writing brushes and inksticks from brands such as Hu Kaiwen and Zhou Huchen are the best, but old brands are mostly expensive. For example, a chicken weasel or small regular script goat hair brush costs no less than 1.5 to 2 yuan in Shanghai, but Nanyang customers are unwilling to pay this amount to buy them. If they were wholesaled at this amount, not only would they not sell in Nanyang, but even if they did, after paying the shipping costs, I'm afraid it wouldn't be enough to cover the costs. Therefore, some booksellers came up with a brilliant plan. They secretly agreed with the bosses of pen workshops in Shanghai to stamp the brand names of famous pen stores on pens worth one, two, three, four, five, and six cents each, and engrave some words such as "Da Jing Shui," "Jin Bu Huan," "Pure Goat Hair," "Small Regular Script Goat Hair," "Chicken Weasel," etc. to meet the needs of Nanyang buyers. Their costs are low, and they can naturally make a profit in Nanyang.</p>
<p>They also sell fountain pens, but they are mostly fake brands. The cheaper ones are worth about 15 yuan per dozen, and the better ones are about 22 yuan. They buy these goods, mostly introduced to them by bookstore runners, who then extract a few percent of the commission from the price of the goods as remuneration.</p>
<p>Booksellers buy goods from Shanghai either in person, by hiring "resident merchants" in Shanghai, or by directly buying goods from bookstores and pen stores using only communication procedures. Nanyang booksellers are mostly from the Yangtze River basin, and they can naturally handle these matters in Shanghai when they go home.</p>
<p>The price of books does not necessarily have to be paid in full in cash; mostly, the "documentary bill" method is used. For example, for a business of one thousand yuan, a cash deposit of two or three hundred yuan is enough, and the remaining amount can be paid to the post office when the books and pens arrive in Nanyang. Needless to say, regular customers can also "charge it."</p>
<p>The business situation of booksellers in Nanyang is like this: those with capital open large or small bookstores and do retail business; those with little capital set up stalls on the roadside, just like the booksellers along the streets of Shanghai; and some sell books by carrying a package from one place to another.</p>
<p>In the early years, running a book business in Nanyang was quite profitable. This was not only because the wholesale price was cheap and the selling price was high, but the difference between the Nanyang silver dollar market price and the Chinese silver dollar was also a reason. For example, one Singapore silver dollar was worth three yuan in Shanghai three or four years ago. Although it is lower now, 100 Singapore dollars are still equal to about 175 Shanghai silver dollars. In the past, when they remitted 100 yuan from Singapore to Shanghai, it would become 300 yuan. They would buy books with 300 yuan and then sell them in Singapore at the local silver dollar price, and there would be several times the interest in between. However, in recent years, Nanyang has been shrouded in depression, and there are far fewer people buying books, so this business is also very difficult to do now.</p>
<p>Celebrity Interview</p>
<h3>Interview with Xu Langxi</h3>
<p>— Dao Kun</p>
<p>Although Mr. Xu Langxi is already in his forties or fifties, his spirit of actively living life is probably something that many young people cannot keep up with. No matter how cold or hot the weather is, as long as it dawns, he gets up; then he begins his day's work. Therefore, anyone who wants to visit him, no matter what your habits are, you have to set off to his house before six o'clock in the morning, otherwise, he will have gone out early, and you will come in vain and not see him.</p>
<p>When I went to visit Mr. Xu, I naturally arrived at his house very early. When I walked to the door of his reception room, I saw three or five middle-aged people talking around an elder with a fluttering beard and vigorous spirit. I recognized that this elder was Mr. Xu Langxi, so I walked in and, with Mr. Xu's amiable reception, chose a seat to settle down.</p>
<p>After the usual few polite greetings, I immediately began</p>
<p>"Mr. Xu, can you tell us what you have been doing recently?"</p>
<p>"Why not? I am determined to do my best and work hard in the cultural cause." When he said this, his eyes seemed particularly sharp, his voice was very loud, and his speech was of course very fluent. His demeanor made you feel that this elder's way of talking was easy to conquer people.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is said that the Xinhua Art College was founded by Mr. Xu. I think the results must be very good now..."</p>
<p>"How good, it's hard to say, but I think as long as we work hard, it will always get better day by day. I believe that all efforts will not be in vain, as long as we are willing to work, anything can be done well. | | Diligence makes everything easy!"</p>
<p>"Yes, didn't Mr. Xu used to edit a magazine called "Shuowang"? It was very good, but why was it discontinued?"</p>
<p>"Ah, there are many reasons, such as economic difficulties." However, there are many cultural undertakings. If one "Shuowang" magazine is discontinued, we can do other things. I will never be discouraged!" He shook his robust hand, expressing a very firm attitude.</p>
<p>"I heard that Mr. Xu is founding a library. I wonder how it is progressing now?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we are buying books."</p>
<p>"How many books do you have now?"</p>
<p>"More than 10,000 copies, and we will continue to buy them!"</p>
<p>"Is the library located in Xinhua?"</p>
<p>"It is temporarily located in Xinhua. However, we will build a new house soon, near Xinhua."</p>
<p>"Mr. Xu is the chairman of the Xianhua Bookstore. I heard that the manager of Xianhua, Mr. Hong Xuefan, has passed away. How will Xianhua be in the future? I think Mr. Xu has a plan for a long time..."</p>
<p>"I can't say. However, everyone's idea is to implement a austerity policy. "Xianhua" magazine and other publications will probably be temporarily discontinued to reduce expenses.</p>
<p>..."</p>
<p>At this time, the other guests suddenly started arguing about the nature of politicians and literati. Therefore, the talkative Mr. Xu Langxi immediately turned his tongue and spoke eloquently about his opinions on this issue | |</p>
<p>"Politicians are naturally good at socializing. They meet anyone and act like they've known them forever, showing a very kind and very concerned appearance. If a politician came here at this time, the atmosphere here would immediately become tense and active, because he would shake hands and talk with everyone here, and tell about his encounters with certain celebrities. But, you must understand, the feelings of politicians are false, they only know how to socialize and respond, and there is no true friendship. I can say that if you meet a politician here, no matter how good he is to you, as long as you walk out the door, he won't recognize you! What about literati? They may not be good at socializing and responding, and their personalities may be a bit aloof, but I want to say that their friendship is real.</p>
<p>..."</p>
<p>The subsequent conversation became very messy: sometimes talking about the problem of youth life, sometimes talking about the problem of Chinese drama, sometimes talking about Mei Lanfang, and sometimes talking about Zhang Xuebin,... | | There were many people and many mouths, and I really don't know how many things were talked about. However, in these discussions, no matter what was talked about, Mr. Xu Langxi had the most interesting opinions. For example, when everyone was talking about the problem of modern love, he said bluntly:</p>
<p>"Love? It is completely dominated by money. As long as you have money and a diamond ring, you can guarantee to get the love of many people. If you don't believe me, please wear a large diamond ring and walk on the road, and there will definitely be many people who come to love you!"</p>
<p>Then there was a burst of laughter from everyone. After this burst of laughter, I said goodbye and came out.</p>

<h3>Salt Transport</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ming</p>
<p>(Guiyang Correspondence) "I don't wish you to be an official or a lord, but I hope you carry 140 or 50 bricks of salt (referring to brick salt, produced in Zigong, Sichuan)." This saying has almost become the only creed by which farmers teach their descendants. Because Guizhou does not produce salt, it relies entirely on Sichuan for its supply. On the main roads connecting Sichuan and Guizhou, one can see salt-transporting teams at all times. They have specialized in transporting salt. They are called "Salt Carriers." These specialists have various ways of transporting salt. In the northern part of Guizhou, most use a "back staff," while in the northern part of Guizhou, most use a "shoulder pole" and "baskets." However, they all use raw strength, and inch forward step by step on the long journey, without any difference.</p>
<p>Guizhou, known as the "Mountain Kingdom," has rugged and towering mountain roads, and layers upon layers of stairs. One is almost constantly circling on the mountains. There is too little flat land. Often, going up and down takes an entire day. Sometimes, starting at the foot of the mountain, one can clearly see the summit. The mountain road is built into countless "zigzag" turns, and one walks for half a day, only to reach the summit. Under these circumstances, a rapid pace is impossible. You must put all your strength on your heels, take one step, then stretch out another step forward. The salt carriers, carrying salt, are already bent enough at the waist, but still not enough, they must bend down as much as possible. If you pay close attention while walking, you will find neatly arranged whirlpools on the stone slabs by the roadside, deep and profound. That is because the salt carriers need to rest when they are tired, so they rest the salt they carry on ox horn-shaped staffs, squatting down, with the staff handle drilling into the stone slab, carving out their achievements.</p>
<p>Their mission is to transport the salt and then transport other things back. In addition, there are also "pack horses" that carry salt or other goods, which form teams of ten, thirty, or fifty. Along the way, on the hillsides, there are always small shops that provide meals and opium smoking for the salt carriers. From afar, you can see couplets that say: "The road ahead is long and far, guest, please sit, fresh rice, bean curd (i.e., hot tofu), add some steel, and stride forward." These kinds of warning sayings hit the spot. A bowl of "overflowing ear head" (i.e., a bowl of rice piled high) costing two hundred cash must be eaten at least two bowls. After eating, looking around, there will be other wonderful words to make you happy, such as: "Exhausted and difficult, once in Nanyan, exhaling clouds and mist, the spirit is refreshed." Here, another hundred cash or several hundred must be spent. They know that smoking opium is harmful, and the profound meaning of "a lonely lamp illuminates a monkey offering its hands, and an opium pipe empties a vast fortune," is thoroughly understood, but because they need to use strength to fight the mountain, opium smoking is still indispensable.</p>
<p>Speaking of mountains, "Nine Dragons and Three Gullies" cannot be forgotten, for it contains some chilling things. Nine Dragons, it is said, has nine peaks, and at the foot of the peaks, you can see three sections of the river. The road passes along the mountainside, or even crosses the peaks, with very deep cliffs below. The mountain road is winding, and you cannot see people coming face to face. The road is narrow, and the cliffs are steep. If you encounter pack horses, you will be stuck. Once, someone was squeezed off by a pack horse and fell down, naturally being smashed to pieces. Later, they learned a lesson and always walked along the stone wall, but unknowingly squeezed the pack horses down. Therefore, at the suggestion of the caravan, they stopped people and requisitioned labor. After a month of excavation, they built a road about three feet wide.</p>
<p>Pack horses are extremely pitiful creatures, with long necks, flat and withered, and they can never lift their heads. Their backs are too terrible, truly seeming to be affected by mold and toxins, bright red, purplish black, and snowy white, forming sores, which are muscles damaged by the pack saddle (i.e., a wooden saddle for carrying goods). Some places are smooth without a single hair, shining brightly. As for the salt carriers, because of the different salt-transporting tools, they also have various typical characteristics. Those who use the "back staff" always have two obvious blood marks on their shoulder bones and chest, and their backs are mostly covered in rashes. Those who use the "shoulder pole" have two raised lumps of flesh on their shoulders, with edges overflowing with a peach-like redness; this is because the "seesaw shoulder pole" is constantly shrinking and expanding, concentrating the weight on one point. The shoulders of those who use "baskets" have a piece of brown and tough shell, with many wrinkled curves underneath.</p>
<p>Generally, spring and autumn are their lucky seasons. Summer is difficult, sweat streaming down, soaking their clothes, and countless canals are opened up on their faces and chests. So, what methods do they use to prevent this? They use bamboo fiber to make bands like short beards, tying them on their eyebrows to prevent sweat from invading their eyes, and use bamboo combs to make rings, scraping away sweat beads, and then wiping them with towels. On the road, except when they reach a station or shop, there is no hot water to drink. With no way out, they have to drink field water or spring water; therefore, cholera spreads; their eyes blur, they throw the salt aside, and they are in such pain that they cannot get up. The wonderful way to treat cholera is to spit two mouthfuls of saliva into the bend of the patient's arm, pat it a few times, and grab it hard a few times, making the skin turn from red to purple, almost bleeding. This is how the disease is cured.</p>
<p>In winter, besides snow, there is continuous drizzle, and the road is slippery. When transporting salt, they must pay attention to packing the salt well. Salt will absorb moisture on rainy days, and if it loses weight, the salt shop will refuse to accept it.</p>
<p>Amateur Sports</p>
<h3>Skating and National Character</h3>
<p>— Li Kui</p>
<p>Skating is a very good sport. In the cold north during winter, skating is as popular as swimming in the hot south during summer. Now that it is winter, I think of skating again. Now I will briefly describe the situation of this sport in Harbin.</p>
<p>In the north, no matter how wide or deep the river, it freezes into very thick ice in winter. Some ice surfaces are as smooth as a mirror (these are natural skating rinks, and there are also artificial skating rinks). So skaters put on skates and run on the ice.</p>
<p>The way they skate and the spirit they show varies depending on their nationality. There are roughly three types of residents in Harbin: the most are Chinese, followed by Russians, and then Japanese. The descriptions are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese people skate for fun. They are always swaying left and falling right on the smooth ice rink, playing by running forward and backward, or using the ice blades under their feet to draw English letters on the ice, such as: Iloveyoy! ...... and so on. They play very naturally, like happy little birds, fluttering around. The appearance is very beautiful, but they have lost the true meaning of skating. They do not treat skating as a sport, but as a game.</p>
<p>Russians skate with a sense of adventure. They always take big strides and run to distant unknowns.</p>
<p>Japanese people skate very skillfully. They do not play useless tricks, nor do they take risks. They just keep running and running on the ice, like a group of swallows probing for water, flying from here to there, and from there to here. Their purpose of skating is entirely for exercising the body. They often run for two hours, stopping only when they can no longer run. After stopping, they sit on the ice to rest, and heat like steam rises from their heads. They do not sing or laugh, they just rest silently. Even if they are very happy, they are unwilling to show it.</p>
<p>From this, we can see the differences in the national character of the three. Although these skaters are not enough to represent their entire national character, it should not be too far off!</p>

<p>At the beginning, I want to say "Unfortunately," until now, we still do not have a systematic and scientific book on the history of Chinese literature; not only that, but we do not have Taine, Lanson, etc., nor do we have more progressive and systematic works on the history of Chinese literature; what we see before us, such as Chinese literary "Great Histories," "Small Histories," and Chinese literary "Historical Outlines," "Historical Essentials," etc., are not mere account books for registering names of books and people, but piles of old dead antiques by gentlemen with "doubting the ancients" or "believing the ancients" sentiments, and fundamentally have no value. Therefore, studying the history of Chinese literature is really a very difficult thing: not only is there no good book that can be used as the basis for our research, but also the collection of materials, sorting of materials, and selection of materials are all problematic.</p>
<p>However, in any case, the history of Chinese literature always needs to be studied using correct scientific methods. These correct scientific methods do not need to be created by us, and some thinkers have already prepared them for us. Although there is still no scientific book on the history of Chinese literature, as long as we can use these existing scientific methods to study hard, scientific and perfect works on the history of Chinese literature will always be produced.</p>
<p>So, what scientific methods should we use to study the history of Chinese literature?</p>
