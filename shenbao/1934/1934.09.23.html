<h3>國聯討論鴉片問題胡世澤痛陳毒禍</h3>
<p>說明我六年禁烟計劃</p>
<p>希望關係國予以合作</p>

<p>（日内瓦）　國聯會第五委員會（人道及社會問題）繼續討論鴉片問題、中國代表胡世澤發表動人演說、茲節述其要點如下、胡氏先對報告員致謝、謂其所作之備忘錄、頗爲有益、但以爲備忘錄雖謂眞正目的在普遍减少毒物、而非法販賣之量數却未見减少、深爲可惜、渠因此贊成西班牙代表加寨萊斯·及委内瑞拉國代表柏雷所提出之計畫、以求進一步之禁毒辦法、故氏嗣又提及英國代表霍爾期布雷女士之宣言、（安霍女士於一九三三年九月下旬在國聯會麻醉品委員會討論鴉片問題時、曾與胡世澤發生辯論、霍女士一再主張對中國麻醉品販賣情形、舉行調查、胡氏則謂此事牽涉租界及治外法權問題、應由各關係國切實合作、且中國法院對於私販處刑　重云云）謂中國並不種植高根葉、故不能製造高根、胡氏又謂中國抄獲之毒物甚多、均係來自歐洲、中國受外來毒物之害、較他國爲甚、其不滿之理由自較他國爲多。此際中國領土有不受中國行政直接管轄者、此等地方所抄獲之毒物、亦在在有之云云、胡氏繼對備忘錄所述中國情形提出異議、蓋報告員在備忘錄中列有（中國出産鴉片幾於毫無限制）之語、胡氏不承認此語、因胡氏與富勒（美國代表前爲鴉片問題曾攻擊中國）之原意、乃謂中國鴉片出産增加、此語與無限制出産顯有分别、自五月以來、中國政府採取種種措置、以限制毒物、行將嚴厲施行、此種措置、係用以對待毒物及鴉片、其懲治毒物之法、較鴉片更爲嚴厲、蓋中國政策欲先行肅清毒物、而後解决鴉片問題也、關於毒物之新措置、處罰極嚴、甚至可處死刑、中國各重要地點已分設醫院、凡受毒物之害者、均强迫送往醫治、違者嚴懲、此項措置已制成條例、分送各省、送達後十日以内卽須實行、中國注意此層、於茲可見、至於鴉片一物、中國政府在若干情形之下、不得不允許吸食、例如年老之人、卽其最顯著之例、惟必待發給執照之後始允吸食、所以如此通融者、蓋恐有烟癮者轉而使用其他毒物也、關於罌粟、新條例規定一年至六年之間分别禁種、並設置視察員、担負新條例實行之責、甚至軍隊亦負此責、胡氏對於備忘錄所載外國輸入中國之無水醋酸數量、提出保留、全國禁烟委員會已呈請政府、將此種物質視爲毒物、此事目下正在研究中、總之中國政府已採取一切必要手段、以清除毒物之害、但必他國合作始能收效、胡氏對於提出大會各决議案、予以贊助、希望能於大會報告書中列入之、胡氏旋謂在中國有租界之各國、與中國之合作已比較密切、更希望一切有關係國家均能合作、昨日意大利代表喀伐沙西尼曾主張求助於精神勢力、以解决此問題、胡氏贊成此意、並引孔子之言、以作結論曰、（已所不欲勿施諸人）云、（廿二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>美報諷刺日本</h3>
<p>九一八後之滿洲已非樂土</p>
<p>自稱和平使者他日必失敗</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　鮑城日報載一社論、標題爲（所謂和平使者之日本、）謂三年前日本佔據滿洲時、自稱爲維持該地之治安、但日本進兵佔據滿洲後、竟實行長期佔領、顯然有其他理由、在事實上、日本在滿洲恢復治安之進步如何、頗堪注意、蓋恢復治安、乃日人宣稱奪滿洲之唯一理由、日人及滿洲僞國、現認滿洲已成樂土、但中國方面消息則相反、證之以美國通信員及中立者之觀察、中國之報告似較爲正確、美國外交恊會専家前李頓調查團顧問彭達夫門稱、（滿洲國）及日本現耗財費力與（匪徒）作戰、自一九三一年後、日本勦匪軍事、不下數千次、故彭氏稱根據上述之事實推論之、滿洲今日所享有之治安、是否能如九一八以前、實難確定、該報主筆未稱、日本雖自稱（和平使者、）似尚未能成功、他日日本若提出亞洲門羅主義、或自居爲遠東和平之維護者、吾人當不忘日本在滿洲失敗之事實云、（二十二日中央社電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）　參議院外交委員會主席貝朗熱近著一文、論法俄之接近、明日將由經濟財政通訊社予以發表、文云、法國與蘇俄接近、則莫斯科與東京關係萬一緊張、使蘇俄在遠東與日本發生衝突、則法國不將有被牽人之危險乎、此層法國外交方式足以避之、蓋（法國因安南關係、自多年以來、與日本關係親善、此種良好國交、將予以維持、於必要時、且將加以充實、法國與蘇俄之妥恊、純以歐洲問題爲限、不能適用於任何亞洲事件）、貝氏又謂蘇俄與法國、雖在外交上妥恊、然兩國内政則彼此絶對獨立、歐戰以前、法俄同盟、其時俄爲帝制、法則共和、彼此絶不相妨、此種保留、旣與國聯盟約不悖、又與歷史往事相符、在如此保留之下、俄法接近、實是鞏固安全而穏定法國之外交也、多腦河之根本問題、固不能由此解决、但日受汎日耳曼主義威脅之歐洲、將由此保持均勢矣云云（二十二哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>滿邊駐軍蘇俄無撤退意</h3>

<h3>林白子綁案犯霍浦曼受鞫訉</h3>

<h3>日兵籐原失踪事件感言廷</h3>
<p>國際往還。貴有誠意。惟誠斯能肝膽相照。守望相助。若不此之圖。而徒尚權詐。肆陰謀。逞蠻力懷毒意。顚倒是非。淆亂黑白。甚或將莫須有之罪名。加諸弱者。而猶標榜親隣之美名。以期取信於人。人又誰能信之。</p>
<p>（九一八）三週年紀念。己在全國悲憤痛切之空氣中經過。日人對我。果有絲毫誠意。自始卽不至有此事變。其後亦必不逐步進展。視僞滿若禁臠。然而事實如此。殆己不復有悔禍之一日矣。目下僅餘之一綫希望。便願日人之理智。稍起作用。勿再多種惡果以自食其報耳。</p>
<p>雖然。其事之難。乃或等於（與虎謀皮）。不觀乎旅日華僑慘被驅逐。置我抗議於不顧。而天津之籐原失踪事件。又將爲彼無端啟釁之藉口。</p>
<p>據本報昨日津電稱。日前日軍有一等卒籐原唐雄失踪。日兵誣我鄕民殺害。日人果藉此以擴大其事者。是欲步藏本失蹤案之後塵耳。方藏本失蹤之初。日人調兵遣艦。聲勢洶洶。一旦眞相大白。則亦廢然自返。吾人方謂日人經此敎訓。如遇同類事實。當必稍加鄭重。不致再疑神疑鬼。而爲此含血噴人之舉也。不謂事之有無。眞相尚未明。而遽誣爲我鄕民所殺。推其用心。無非欲造成中村事件第二。以逞其所大欲。彼籐原者設非及早尋獲。不又將一躍而爲其國家之功臣乎。</p>
<p>抑又有進者。籐原一日本之駐津兵士耳。天津之有日兵。乃以辛丑和約爲根據。不平等條約之桎梏。在吾人早己不勝苦痛。而日人則猶欲推波助瀾。惟恐不力。</p>
<p>從來一國旅外僑民。必受居留國法律之統轄。而後得蒙居留國政府之保護。而其保護程度。且不能超過於其本國人民之上。今在華日僑。平素藉領事裁判權之庇蔭。非我直接可干涉。一旦遇事。則欲諉我以保護不周之責任。衡情度理。豈得謂平。普通日僑猶能逍遙於我國法律之外。而况爲帶甲之兵士。駐華日軍之行動。史非我國官廳可得而裁判。苟有失蹤等情。自當惟其直屬之長官是　　　　　　　　　　　　　於後則對己爲失責對人爲誣　居一於是。適足自汚而己。</p>
<p>夫日人自殺之風。獨盛於世界。誰能擔保在若許之日僑日兵中。必無自殺之事實。幸而前之藏本與今之籐原。猶能安然生還。種種糾紛。自然消滅。假若因其個人特殊之理由。而竟至自殺。而其自殺。之眞相又未易明。則其謂我謀害。我雖百口。又將安辯耶。若謂今日之日僑日兵。我必一一派警保護。然後差可自免於無罪。試問此豈事實之所許。而天下萬國。亦焉有此怪狀耶。</p>
<p>或者曰。中日關係惡劣。日人知之甚稔。疑慮之來。職是之故。然則今日爲日人計。當必修德止怨補過攺非。以自表見其誠意之所在。又奈何不於此三致意乎。</p>

<h3>法蘭西政局現况（法國通信）</h3>
<p>政治應付裕如外交敏捷</p>
<p>經濟左右支絀財政維艱</p>
<p>歐洲到處都彌漫着戰雲、特别是在中歐、在波羅地海等地更見顯著、在中歐方面以奥國爲中心、本來奥國是戰前歐洲的强國之一、大戰以後、喪師割地、不能不俯仰由人、經濟上雖有一點奢侈品輸出、但無海口、農業更不能自給、所以經濟狀態竟陷於絶境、祇有仰求國聯帮一點忙、而民族關係上、德意志種人占全人口的百分之九十四、所以在政治上接近德國的可能性大些、因此、就成爲法意德三國爭霸的惟一焦點、</p>
<p>陶爾斐斯被刺、眞是一髮千鈞的時候、意大利運隊旣開到國境綫上、取嚴密監視態度、捷克也有了準備、法國當時更不能不秘密警戒、某閣員曾講到、如果意兵有一人一騎越入奥境、法國卽將預備全體總動員、由此就可以知道當時情形的緊張了、所幸的是刺殺陶爾斐斯的是奥國國社黨員、與德無干、事件本身不致於怎樣擴大、希特勒的態度尤其審愼、甚至將國社黨對粤監察部長哈畢脫免職、以减少各國的物議、於是法國纔竭力表示鎭静、採取旁觀監視、</p>
<p>可是事寳上她仍舊不放鬆國際間的縱横活動、她明白凡爾賽體系、已經動搖、波蘭的對德友好、使法國的歐洲霸權、在東歐之一角有崩潰之象徴、巴爾都遍遊各國的結果、理證明她的衛星、如果没有新力量的轉換、都容易分化、一種是對意表好感、一種是隨波蘭之後、於是她纔决定一意拉攏蘇聯、這不止是外交上的親近而已、政治上的諒解也一步近一步、因爲她們的共同的目的是限制德國、祇要把德國限制着了、則歐洲和平現狀卽不難保持、最近的法國、整個國際外交都在這一點上、</p>
<p>至於法國國内的經濟形勢、表面似乎還好、失業工人並不很多、可是我們曉得法國各工廠的工人、多半都是由農村裏招來的、及至無工可作的時候、他們就再回到鄕下去、所以城市中的失業者聚集得並不多、經濟現象不怎樣壞、但是法國努力要保持金本位制、所以不得不實行財政緊縮、一般國民的消費就跟着萎縮下去、譬如物價總指數、（照一九一四年七月的基準）今年一月爲三八八、四月爲三七八、七月就跌到三六一了、這當中國内製造品本年一月爲四三四、四月爲四二一、七月就祇家四○○了、至於外國貨則本年一月的指數爲三○五、四月爲三○○、七月爲二九一、並且輸出還相當盛旺、市塲競爭很混亂、尋常的看法、總以爲她旣設爲高關稅壁壘、應該能阻止外貨的輸入、國内製造品應能得實利、却因爲各國都拚命找海外市塲並拒外貨輸入、所以法國吃了大虧、今年一月至七月的對外貿易輸出總數爲一百零一萬五千萬法郎、輸入爲一百四十三萬二千八百萬法郎、比較去年减少了、特别是七月間的貿易額數、較一九二九年的不過是百分之三十四而已、</p>
<p>對外貿　旣萎縮、生産總指數（以一九一三年爲基準）今年一月爲一○六、七月就跌到九九了、政府的財政當然要同受影響、本年度的預算不足、從前估量有四十萬萬法郎、杜美格全國一致内閣組織的時候、竭力要求預算的均衡、直到最近還是看不見改善的成績、今年大夏季歲收總計爲八十八萬九千四百萬法郎、對預算不足八萬七千四百萬法郎、與春季歲收合計、其不足額有十五萬五千二百萬法郎、全年枯計會有三十萬萬法郎、這是她經濟恐慌的深化、丨丨失業人數增加、破産事件加多、國庫收入减少、一般社會消費力低落、如此推演下去、恐怕金本位要不能維持、法郎的覇權也會搖動了、（一九三四年八月十八於巴黎）</p>

<p>舊花調换勢難允准　據稱、印花稅票、係對憑證徴稅、原有一定時效、本部規定之印花稅徴收辦法、向係實貼、年來商民遵章實貼者、固屬不少、因循偷漏者、亦比比皆是、如此取巧、影響國家稅收甚鉅、爰特發行新印花、期掃從前積弊、最近各地商會、曾請救本部以舊印花調换新印花、或延長行使時間、財部自全國財政會議議决後、已延至十一月一日發行、顧卹商民、已屬無微不至、故此項請求、揆諸事實、勢難允准、</p>

<p>體之熱誠贊襄、以及各地民衆之踴躍參觀、在在皆足證西北需要國貨之殷切、及舉行西北流展影響之深遠、雖參加各廠、均以此行開支之鉅而蒙損失、實際上此行已開國貨到西北去之先河、並已樹西北人士愛用國貨之良好基礎、可謂鉅大實貴之收穫、得失相衡、各廠實佔其益、開封·鄭州·洛陽·西安·四地商業情形、自前以鄭州爲較佳、然不久之將來、要以西安爲最有希望、蓋陜省前以迭遭天災人禍、民不聊生、購買力大减、一時幾無商業可言、殆近二三年、楊邵二公分治軍政、匪清地靖、百政漸舉、而全國經濟委員會復以人力財力、團輔助陜省各項重要利民建設、農作物如棉如麥、均連年豐收、今歲收成尤佳、滬上各銀行濟欵救農、輔助農村發展、亦屬不遺餘力、荒地重熟、農村復蘇、社會經濟、實已怅</p>
<p>具最大轉機、因之商業情形、亦自然的漸趨於蓬勃佳良之境、所惜該地洋貨充斥、各大商號、盡爲洋貨推銷商、而滬津各洋行派往調查及推銷之中外職員、尤絡繹於途、注意不懈、吾國貨界、以前自甘放棄西北市塲、不稍注意、致使洋貨先我而入、坐佔優越地位、言之痛心、本會此次以最大决心、辦理西北流展、亦即所以使各廠有機會、目擊此種情形、俾知努力、現流展團已結束、甚望各廠將此行觀察所得、作爲參考、積極産造適合西北需要之出品、赴西北經營推銷、母使洋貨永佔市塲、所以副西北人士之期望、亦所以保國家之元氣、本會責任所在、亦自當隨時督促、並爲各廠謀推銷上之便利云、</p>

<h3>取締棉花攙水攙雜棉業統制會發表經過</h3>
<p>各省取締所本月内完全成立</p>
<p>經濟委員會撥給經費說不確</p>
<p>新聲社云、國民政府於二十日公佈取締棉花攙水攙雜暫行條例施行細則、並定於十一月一日起實行、棉業統制委員會、因連日報章所載、頗有失實之處、昨對新聲社記者、特發表書面談話如下、我國棉産、向爲農産之主要者、但在紡織未發達前、除出口外、多供手工紡織及塡塞夜被之需、經過販運手續甚少、攙水攙雜者、故亦不多、迨歐戰發生、國内紡業進步、棉産增多、作僞情事、因之日廣、其影響於國外貿易及紡織工程者甚鉅、致使紡織有購用國棉不如外棉之感、實實部前鑒於</p>
<p>棉花作僞　産地檢騐、故先於上海·漢口·靑島·天津·等口岸、設立商品檢騐局、對於棉花先行檢騐、以維華棉在國外貿易上之信譽、凡屬輸出之棉花、必須有檢騐證書、始能報運出口、對於輸出棉花、已有相當成效、國内紡錠、逐年增加、銷費旣多、輸出自减、是以目前取締棉花作僞、内地重於出口、本會於上年十月成立、對於原棉問題、確定攺良與推廣並重之原則、尤注意於西北一帶適宜美種栽培區域、推廣純良美棉、以濟國内缺乏長絨之急、此外凡産棉省區、亦先後設立棉産改進所、故本年各省棉産、除受災害者外、在産量方面、或品質方面、均有相當進步、但不</p>
<p>加緊取締　作僞、即此相當的進步、勢必爲作僞所毁滅、是以在改進棉産進行之時、亟應輔以取締作僞之工作、故本會於實施攺進棉産之後、即與實業部恊商、加緊取締作僞之法、經多次討論、訂定取締棉花攙水攙雜暫行條例、函由全國經濟季員會送經行政院中央政治會議及立法院審核通過、由國民政府於七月十日、明令公布、此項條例公布之後、本會一面與實業部商訂條例施行細則、亦經行政院審核通過、於本月二十日、由國民政府公布、一面即着手凖備接洽、設立中央及各省棉花攙水攙雜取締所事宜、在中央棉花攙水攙雜取締所所長及副所長未經全國經濟委員會聘定之前、暫由實業部上海商品檢騐技正、本會技術専員葉元鼎、</p>
<p>負責籌備　各省取締所、河南已經成立、其他各省、亦均派人分别接洽恊商進行、大約均可於本月内先後成立、至於中央取締所經費、將請由中央担任、各省取締所經費、以各省自任爲原則、有不足時、再行代向中央請求補助、處此中央及各省政費均極感困難時代、事雖不得不積極進行、而費用則力求撙節、昨日報載申時社稿、謂（經委會並撥一百萬元作爲經費）、及（經委會特於日前撥下經費六十萬元、作爲開辦費用）、完全不近事實、此應鄭重聲明者也、要之、剷除棉花攙水攙雜、爲攺進吾國棉産必要途徑、深盼全國紗商棉商通力合作、期於兩年之内、將多年積弊、根本剷除、則政府今日之措施、爲不虚矣、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>唱歌跳舞是藝術嗎？</h3>
<p>丨答劉大可君丨</p>
<p>（唱歌跳舞也是藝術麽？）</p>
<p>（看電影，看圖畫，我懂得牠們的好處，但唱歌跳舞，除了給人以性慾的剌激外，還有什麽，歌舞，什麽萬花團等算得偉大了，我都見識過，但我們能從那裏我到什麽？淫靡的歌，肉感的舞，除了大腿曲綫之外，······</p>
<p>大可君的話，只能說是一種憤慨，就現在流行的歌舞來說，也許是可以的，但如果因此便根本否認歌舞的藝術性，那便很有可商的餘地了。</p>
<p>我們知道：歌無是一切藝術的起源，幾乎有了人類便有歌舞。它們和人類勞働的關係比任何藝術都要密切，它們是緊伴着勞働而也現的，在原始，唱歌是勞働的直接的呼聲；人類在勞働時發出來（咿呀咿呀）的聲音，便是原始音樂；跳舞，是人類勞働技能的再演習，譬如，狩獵時代，跳舞就是演習打獵，模倣野獸的動作，不過到了生産工具發達之後，這才歌舞隨着其它一切藝術的開展而與社會生産生活漸漸脫離，歌無，是一步一步的由實際的効果達到美的効果的藝術，是最接授大衆的藝衛。</p>
<p>是前流行的歌舞，已經完全脫離了大衆，已往成了少數人的娱樂的東西、固然不容我們否認、但這仍不能否認牠的藝術性的存在。藝術，即是美的表現，一件藝術品，主要的是能引起觀衆或聽衆的官感上，思想上的滿足，你看到肉感的舞，淫靡的歌，也許感到無聊，然而有些人却正沈醉在這種誘惑，麻醉之中，這正是它的藝術的効果。倘如你所說，歌舞不含有藝術性，那末，那些歌舞影片的製造者，便再用不著大批投資在這上面　。所以我們反對流行的歌舞，應該站在一定的觀點上，指出它的發生的社會根源，因爲淫靡歌舞的發生還有其社會背景的，指出道種歌舞是歌舞藝術的墮落，是遠離開大衆的，决不能一筆抹殺歌舞的藝術性。這正和文學上有歌功頌德的奉仕文學，在三角四角的性交文學一樣，我們决不能因這些使發生文學是不是藝術的疑問。</p>
<p>而且，即使在現在，歌舞還是比其它一切藝術品的藝術効果更在。不要說，流行鄕村的許多民歌，正是他們感表的暴露，賽會時的團牌，台角，還留下了大衆舞蹈的殘形，再退一步，因爲歌舞，是與聽覺和視覺發生直接影的，一隻悲壯的歌，對于一些小識字的人，是比千百篇巨著，更能感動他們，這該是没有疑問的事實吧。這樣，不但根本否認歌舞的藝術性要不得，即消極的反對現在流行的歌舞片也還不够，應該積極地，使歌舞從淫靡中逃出來，建設那有更高藝術的大衆歌舞。</p>

<p>下半時陳鎭祥因足傷、李惠明代人、尚稱滿意、鍾育祥亦休息來出、對方陣線、亦小加變動、因此局勢漸趨和緩、鍾勇森亦未如上半時之賣力、惟優游仍佔上風、法商雖時有騷擾、俱不足介意、上塲孫錦順又對門施以猛射、爲拉蒙撲出、鍾勇森曾勾中一球、羅海光踼人、以已出界作廢、小鍾又孤軍深入、以嫌慢爲琴生阻出、諸如此類、皆令人可惜、不料在　後之五分鐘　突來興奮劑、老孫鐵腿射門、爲拉蒙托出、忽然閃出梁樹棠、自後一脚、竟亦中鴻鵠、結局遂成四比一、</p>

<h3>過渡時期是没有的！</h3>
<p>— 齊速</p>
<p>在（賢母良妻）這一問題的討論下、有着像芸綺女士那樣透澈的理論、以歷史的眼光肯定賢母良妻制，是封建社會的産物，是一種男子利用來拘縛女子成爲家庭奴隷的最狡猾的手段，凡讚頌賢母良妻制的，即是向歷史開全倒車。）當然（歷史是前進的）！當對建的制度己經成了陳跡時，再來頌讚賢母良妻制，無疑的這是（復古）的一翼、這是開倒車！然而在黎瑚君的（不能同意）的（駁釋）中，以爲賢母良妻制的解釋是（往往隨時境的變换而更易）。我也是很佩服這見解，但無奈（它的解釋）雖隨時境的攣换而更易，而在對建社會中發生，成畏，同時也跟了封建社會的崩潰而成了歷史上的沉渣的賢母良妻制的本質，却决不能因時境的變换而主觀的指定它己（更易）成了别一種東西的。歷史誠然是像黎瑚君所說的那樣是前進的，但却並不帶了沉渣一起前進！歷史對於在其發展中被淘汰了的東西，是棄之不顧的。所以黎瑚君所說現代的解釋，亦僅止是解釋而己。而我們所知道的頌讚者們的（眞髓）的意義，却並不以解釋爲滿足，其眞面目是要女子們丢棄了社會，關進家庭裏去。即此可以省却許多（嘩啦嘩啦）的或是别的什麽麻煩而己。無論以怎樣的漂亮的解釋來扮飾。但在本質上却始終是對於女子的一種欺騙，一種壓迫。我們站在爲社會服務和在政治上經濟上根本平等的觀點上夾講。我肯定的說女子是應該從育兒與家庭的瑣事中解放出來，和男子一樣的佔一社會的地位，爲社會服務，使社會前進！何况在這時輪的進展下，大部分的女子，正在不得不離家，或無家可歸的了。</p>
<p>然而又有像潘伊紅君那樣的提出：（嚴重的過渡時期）的問題來了。大槪以爲舊的旣然推翻而新的却還未築成之前，我們應該怎樣辦呢？但是我却要决然的說：所謂（過渡時期）是没有的！歷史的發，並不像（舊官己去，新官尚未上任）那樣的一個空着的時期。歷史的發展，是舊的在新的面前逐漸的消滅下去；新的在舊的裏面發生與發展起來。這是一個聯繫的整個的並且是一個動的關係！我們决不能機械的把歷史的發展切成一段一段，而以爲從這一段到那一段之間是有着一個過渡時期的存在。即以（賢母良妻）這一問題來講，舊的封建的女子的關係，並不是己經消滅了，而是正在消滅着；新的平等的女子的地位，也並不是還没有確立，而是正在發展着，也就是新的是在與舊的衝突之中成長着。而在這樣的一個動的關係之中的我們的（嚴重）的任務便是；怎樣把舊的推翻，消滅，而又怎樣使新的發展與確立。却並不需要造出一個過渡時期，來怍一個維持現狀的妥恊的辦法，妥恊的辦法是一個拙劣的辦法，無補於寳際問題的解决的。</p>
<p>最後：我再說一遍，在動的辯證的觀點上來討論（賢母良妻）的問題，我肯定的說（過渡時期）是没有的！</p>
<h3>綠漪的棘心和寫棘心時的綠漪</h3>
<p>— 江雪</p>
<p>（棘心）是一部凄厲艶的力作，很爲一般善良的名媛閨秀們所愛讀，具有磁一樣的吸引力和電一樣的感動力。因爲這是一部自傳式的作品，從這裏面，我們可以看出寫（棘心）時的綠漪底宇宙觀和人生觀。寫（棘心）時的綠漪是怎樣一個人物呢？讓她自己來說吧：（她是一個理性頗强，而感情又極豐富的女靑年。她贊成唯物派哲學，同時又要求精神生活，傾向科學原理，同時又富有文藝的情感。）殘留着昨日的氣息，眩目於今日，矇矓於明日的一個名門閨秀！</p>
<p>（棘心）的描寫，有三個重心：一，愛（尤其是母愛）的氛圍。二，大自然禮讚的氛圍。三，宗敎的氛圍。這部書全部充滿着人的氣息，泥土的氣息，神的氣息。不過這三個重心是一貫的，我們統統可歸結於（愛）丨丨統統是由愛出發，又歸結到愛。</p>
<p>小有産者有兩種典型：一種是消極的，保守的，和平的；另一種是潑刺的　是潑刺得瘋狂，敵愾的（但是不過匹夫之勇）。這二種典型也有一個共通點，即是同樣的游離於現實。</p>
<p>人道主義者，厭世派是屬於第一種典型的。（不過說人道主義者，厭世派爲消極，或許有人要說：（這是方巾氣的說法！）他們有火一般的熱情，他們才是挺積極的人。然而我們不從動機上着眼而着眼於實踐，那樣說法是不會過分錯的。）他們只躱在現制度的圈套中作局部的努力，成者藏在社會的襞積中履行着一種慢性的自殺。</p>
<p>屬於第二種曲型的人物趨向於另一極端。他們的熱情造成他們的色盲，他們以玩世的態度馳聘於社會，新禱宇宙陸沉，或者（對於革命猶如向着新婦，把幾百萬的頌辭，鐵的讚美，竭聲謳歌）而實際對於革命全然無知。</p>
<p>寫（棘心）時候的綠漪，大約我們可以放入人道主義這一檔案中，因爲（棘心）裏面，除掉愛和憐憫，幾乎再找不出旁的理東西。</p>
<p>醒秋的母親（是　慣了離别的滋味的，）每年和丈夫别離，和上學去的兒女别離。）這實在也是一般在家庭中受難的主婦們共通的刻體的痛苦。然而問題的核心不在她們和丈夫，子女别離，是由於她們在男子中心社會中没有獨立的人格，除了父母，丈夫，兒女，别無依靠。生活，求學都是必需的，醒秋的求知慾和懷鄕病，種予盾頑强地對立着，要求這矛盾的克服，不是丈夫丢了職業去厮守着老婆，女兒讀書未成就從法國奔回故鄕。造厉醒秋母親的痛苦，同時即是造成醒秋（刻體的疚心）的是什麽呢？是醒秋的崛强麽？錯了！</p>
<p>醒秋崇拜（精神貞操），認爲（精神貞操之重要，更在肉體之上。她己經是一個未婚夫了，她將來是不免要和他結婚的，她應當將全部的愛情交結他。）醒秋在這地方十足地表現出一只手拖着十九世紀的尾巴的半新不舊的女子。</p>
<p>（精神貞操）與戀愛至上讑一脈相傅，（精神貞操之重要，更在肉體之上）更不像贊成唯物派哲學的人所說的話。醒秋和不婚夫連面都没有見過，而將來是（不免）要和他結婚，應當將全部的愛情交給他，這是目前覺醒的婦女所要不得的。</p>
<p>（來夢湖上養疴）一章寫着：（這裏没有眼涙，只有歡笑，没有戰爭，只有和平。）不知道這裏的歡笑正是建築於本國和弱小民族的勤勞大衆們的眼涙上，這裏的和平建築在戰爭上。小有産者總不免近視，他們只看到自我週遭的一圈小環境，未曾把眼光射到遠處，只見樹木，不見森林。全書謳歌着法國，未曾對這一帝國主義有半個字的深刻的分析。</p>
<p>醒秋看到修女們把（她們的綺年玉貌，情愛和幸福，完全消磨在藥鑪茶鼎之間，她們的工作，没有報酬，精神的安慰，便是她們最大的報酬，她們的犧牲，不圖世人的讚掦，只圖翕合上帝的聖意。）看到白朗和馬沙的背着十字架爲病人窮人謀福利，深深地感動，對於她們的（動機和熱忱）表示崇高的影仰；但醒秋分明不看見滔滔的（吃敎）者：分明無視於基督敎徒在弱小民族腹地扮演着大地主，高利貸者，土皇帝的角色；不知道這些人客觀上是統治者，壓迫者最好的工具，掩蔽其實，替人間的魔鬼們粉飾，和他們支撑統治的殘局，麻痺被壓迫者神經，消滅被壓迫者的戰鬥情緒；同時，私有制度的機器以電的速率製造出滾滾的窮苦人，一一個白朗和馬沙根本救濟不盡。</p>
<p>信仰對於一個在矛盾中受難的人們是必須的，我們必須對於明日有　種確信，對於從客觀　實中得出的眞理有　種不拔的信仰，但不是去信仰　個人造出來的幻像，而　觀上爲敵人服務。（信仰是人類最高精神力的活動），因爲有　種信仰，（人的本性是自私的，能變爲利他，人的本性是怯弱的，能變爲神勇。）這說法是不錯的。</p>
<p>由於認識之不足，醒秋雖然受過科學洗禮，懂得（人們之歸心於神，是在有求於神的時候。）這一眞理，她到底皈依了，到底不能將這一矛盾克服而統。</p>
<p>醒秋似乎懂得　點唯物論，但是僅僅懂得（一點），而且又是歪曲了的。（唯物論者告訴我們······人與動物之間，祇有程度的差異，没有性質的區别，便是人與木石無性　的東西相比，他不過程度的高下而己。定命論告訴我們，意志不自由，意志不過是一種必然的作用。）這裏的唯物論是庸俗的機械論，這裏的定命論是嗎啡精式的宿命論。科學的唯物論　爲人與猿猴之間也是質的差異，科學的唯物諭從來未曾將人的自由看落，大師們只說過這樣的話：（自由是認識了的必然。）</p>
<p>醒秋愛祖國，認爲土匪横行是祖國的大恥辱，從這裏表示出攺良主義者醒秋對於現狀的迷戀。土匪横行，就是被壓迫者的活躍，現統治的動搖，客觀上不是（恥辱）而是喜訊。　雖然未嘗不恨軍閥，懂得土匪是内戰的産物，但是她除掉咒祖他們自行滅亡，别無更具體的意見。只是咒詛，咒詛了他們會滅亡嗎？不會的唯一的辦法是掮起叛亂的大　，如同虔誠的宗敎家背起十字架一樣。</p>
<p>綠漪的（棘心）和寫（棘心）時的綠漪所給我的印象是這樣！</p>
<p>不過時代在疾轉，綠漪女士也不是不變的，現在的綠漪的（棘心）時代的綠漪是兩付不同的面目了。最近文學月刋上她寫了一篇（沈從文論）證實了上面那句話。</p>
<h3>蘇聯的妻子（四）（續）</h3>
<p>— Ａnng　Loiuse　Strong亮秋譯</p>
<p>我們也有我們的倫理。假若美國人非難我們的容易結合和容易離婚，那我們也不贊成他們的戲劇和電影裏的兩性的誘惑。（（我知道你們美國的電影丨丨很多的接吻，）有一次一個蘇聯靑年譏諷地說。）古代婚姻中虚僞的抑制，甜蜜的兩性的羅曼史；把結婚看做人生的目的，或歐戰後西方各國所討論的許多兩性問題，對於我們都没有用了。没有三角戀愛的戲劇值得我們整晚的討論。在我們三角）兩字不指兩性間的關係，而指工廠的管理者，就是；董事，工會，和黨的秘書；這是我們日常談話中的（三角）這或許就是我們生命的象徴。</p>
<p>假若對於我們的倫理有適當的批評的話，那是；我們對於兩性問題的太不關心丨丨不是太關心。外界的竸爭和新奇吸引了我們整個的心，我們没有餘暇注意到個人生活的深奥和享樂。我們的靑年男女知道他們新的交誼的優點，而己婚的人覺得他們的伴　比世上任何國家裏的都要自由而親切。</p>
<p>因爲我們是蜂房中的工蜂，以交尾爲生命的目的的雄蜂是我們螫刺的對象。我們的理想是大的農塲和工廠，我們的情感是充滿了無窮的計劃，我們的幻像是：（人類的征服世界）兩性生活是一枝火炬，牠照亮了，温暖了在這行程中停止的人。假若有人問我們感否個人的快樂，我們的答語是：我們没有體騐，也没有工夫體騐。因爲我們的生命面着外界，每一科學上的發明，每一只飛機經過北海，這才是我們的新的刺激。</p>
<p>我們這樣的不注重個人生活，到底有什麽不對呢？當這樣想時，我們立刻紀起一個美國精神病醫生惠廉博士的話。他以爲大部份美國的神經病的起源是（爭噪）的家庭。心理分祈者發現每個有財産的男女都有神經病的現象。在蘇聯，因爲我們的合理的，没有財産關係的結合，和我們對於外界的専心，所以神經病和心病是少有的。有些蘇聯人以爲個人的享樂主義，和宗敎下相反的主義一樣，是精神枯燥的結果。</p>
<p>有一個老的共産黨幾年以前對我說：（在歐戰前，我們爲了正義和權利而爭鬥，我們這時代是爲了自動車或牙刷而爭鬥。在我看來，最後的目標是人類的心靈；但非再過五十年，不能達到這目標。這一代和下一代是設計和製造機器，人心就専注在這些事上。再下一代方始有時間去探討世界上各種更深切的問題。</p>
<p>將來的人是否如此？或者這些話祇是荒謬的狂論？這是現代的蘇維埃能評批的。然而有一事，我以爲是很確定的。那就是；無論我們的生活和戀愛方式是未來時代的合理方式，或祇是暫時的對於過去財産占有欲的革命，這種革命會被將來更豐富的個人和社會生活所代替；但在這世界上，這一時代中，没有更快樂，更完備的生活路徑了。</p>

<h3>母女</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>不管是晴天陰天，不管是漫天乾灰或是滿地泥淋，金二嫂總得把一匹灰黑的瘦小得鷄似的騾子駕在木輪車前面，冒着風雨到塲裏領買賣去，苦寒與溽暑交换地折磨着這顆孤零的心，把一個年輕的孀婦轉變成一個老練耐苦的老人。打着皺紋的臉和打着皺紋的手是比她的年齡老過了十倍，其賞自己的女孩子才十九歳啊。每當想起女兒小榴或當人家問到那失踪了的姑娘時，她總是苦着臉半晌不言不語地，額上的太陽穴扭着筋，在記憶裏爬起一個不算太蠢的女孩子來，她曾依着母親的暖懷在騾車上度過一個嚴冬又一個嚴冬，布片包得她像一隻死蛤蟆，不能動彈，凍得發白發紫的面龐使女人疑惑着她的生死，然而到底算活了下來。</p>
<p>（小榴呢？幾時會回來？）</p>
<p>自己也不能答覆這問題。記起前年老在自家門前走過的老總們，那是臨時調駐過來的守衛，就住在和金二嫂的大雜院不遠的關帝廟裏，在清晨傍晚母女倆上工下工時總會碰見一羣羣的灰制服的漢子，連串的嘻笑便緊接着送了過來：</p>
<p>（大姑娘辛苦嘍！）</p>
<p>（没事來玩玩！黑妞兒。）</p>
<p>小榴的臉的確有點黑，因爲那大車上整天載的是煤塊，到下工回來時是臉和手都像煤球似的，簡直難洗凈。金二嫂比留神自己的騾子還利害地守着小榴，這兩年這丫頭健壯得和牛一樣，雖然比她爸爸差好些，但也很能帮一氣忙的了，每當吃窩頭喝豆汁時女人總瞪着眼瞅着小榴的狂嚼，同時便瞇着眼笑了；</p>
<p>一多吃點吧，長點力氣多做活！）</p>
<p>女人担心的是騾子老了，食料省了可是活計也差太遠了，有時載煤重了點便走　得像　爬似的，鞭子抽下去牠也忍了，脚下總也提不起來，每天來回的趟數越來越少。爲這，領的工錢便少下去。</p>
<p>指望的是女兒啊！</p>
<p>當那羣老總們在餐上偷出來串門子時，女人總囑咐小榴不要理睬，女孩子却滿不在乎地咧咧嘴，也不顧母親在暗地生氣，慢慢地心上添了一個灰制服掛皮帶的影子，那影子直在自己眼前幌動；</p>
<p>（小榴，勇敢點走吧！）</p>
<p>小九歳的姑娘便在一個春寒的深　溜走了，正是那隊守衛也調走了的時候。金二嫂的坑上是空空的，女兒是那麽狠心，一句話也没留下。只在夢裏瞧見小榴作了排長太太，臉上塗了白粉，代替那黑煤灰。醒來便一不要臉的丫頭）那麽地駡着。</p>
<p>可是在金二嫂趕着遲緩的驟車在灰塵中驅走時便又嘆着氣，指望着當了排長太太的女兒來接母親。</p>
<p>騾子的蹄聲叩地，敲着女人的記憶，但小榴却始終没有音響。</p>
<h3>少女菲莎（續）</h3>
<p>— 仃</p>
<p>本來，那些朋友都是她日常所接觸的，君謾是她從小在一塊長大的，她比菲莎大，學識也稍爲高些，而且，她丨君謾會經參加過（會婦女運動。所以在君謾那兒，菲莎常常聽到）些關于革命的術語，嶄新的名詞，和各種時事問題。開始她不大了解，之後她有點明白，最後她知道君謾時常對她說起那些話，無非是誇張自己的品格，掩飾自己没落的靈魂，开且也是用來挾制她的一種手段而己。</p>
<p>所以對於君謾那種的行爲，得了個反感，她己經不信任她了。</p>
<p>終於，她們之間的感情不能繼續維持下去了·原因是誰也不願低威誰。</p>
<p>此後，菲莎漸漸的對於她們用以自恃的那種事情，她起了一種極大的好奇心，追求心，她漸漸直覺一個女子想完成她們的使命，想提高她們的地位，想在男性的禁錮中，約束下解放出來，想從這個不平等的社會制度獲得女性的權利，獲得人類同等的權利，那末，非努力那種事業不成的，她常常這麽想着。</p>
<p>於是，她設法認識了畢生竭力于這種偉大工作的人，她學習，她受訓練，她自動的工作起來。洗革了一切過去那些小姐式的生活，肅清不正確的觀念，糾正了自己過去那些輕薄的行爲，勇敢地刻苦耐勞地幹着。</p>
<p>她打破，粉紅色的夢，抛棄了家庭，丈夫，兒女，絶無悔惜地留戀地跑上艱難困苦的路上來。</p>
<p>對於君謾這種朋友，這種人，她此刻想，覺得非常的可恥，她背叛了自己的人格，投進没落的變愛生活的懷抱裏。</p>
<p>她很爲君謾漸愧，很爲君謾可惜，一個具有前途的女子，受過新敎育的洗禮，爲什麽要甘自堕落呢？難道革命是　着自己嗎？</p>
<p>菲莎現在變了，和六年前的菲莎兩樣了。此刻她冷雋，對於什麽事都苦心去思索，生活把她鍜鍊成個堅硬的壯美的有清晰頭腦，敏捷的智慧勇敢的精神的人兒。</p>
<p>此刻，她什麽也不妄想了，工作是她的愛人，自由是她的目標！英勇地進行着她們的事業，大衆的事業。丨完丨</p>
<h3>各國的女學生</h3>
<p>— 荿節譯</p>
<p>（一）意大利</p>
<p>意大利自羅馬以及各都市，女學生很少見。這也許是因爲那兒信奉加特力敎，通常寄宿校内很少出外；再則那兒没有特别的服裝，不能一望而知其爲女學生。</p>
<p>現今首相墨索里尼，對於敎育非常賣力；尤其欲使次代的國民攺良，特别注意女學校和小學校。</p>
<p>意大利女子敎育方針，是採賢母良妻主義。一般年輕的女性，都保有女性的優美。她們大抵居於家庭，很少出外服務。家敎敎育觀念頗强，知　方面似乎不甚深　，她們也不是有理頭研究的表現。</p>
<p>她們因爲是在南國，非常明朗而快活。顔色雪白，頭髮烏黑（很少剪短髮的），看去很美麗。時常一面唱歌，一面愉快地工作。</p>
<p>（二）德國</p>
<p>德國女件的第一印象便是健廉美，每當希特勒在各地演講之時，女學生常唱着讚美歌，游行街市。服裝素朴，上面褐色的短衣，有些像褐衫黨的制服；下面再穿同一顔色的短裙。黑色紗襪，運動鞋。使用化裝品的没有一人，女學生而化裝，大家以爲值得輕蔑。</p>
<p>那兒是第一的健美之國，從小學時代即注重體育和舞蹈。僅僅柏林一地，體育舞蹈和藝術舞蹈的學校共有二百餘。除了専門習舞蹈的而外，小學中學的學生，放課之後，穿一件薄薄的襯衫，都跑到運動塲去練習。</p>
<p>每日上學的時候，大抵騎了脚踏車，通過六七里或十餘里的長途。貧窮的女學生，爲獲得學費，也有在街上彈契塔，頗似曼陀林）或奏提琴。</p>
<p>女學生幾乎絶不出入跳舞塲，一年中惟聖誕節和自己的生日最爲快樂，這時可以和女同學，跳個通宵達旦。</p>
<p>女生宿舍内，可以懸掛愛人的照片，舍監也不以爲怪。因爲相信她們己能自己處置，即使有失戀的事情，她們的理智也不至呌她們自殺</p>
<p>（三）蘇聯</p>
<p>有人說蘇聯的女人像熊，初聽似乎侮辱了她們，細想却很有意思。在西歐遊覺了各個代表的都市，看慣了女人裝飾得孔雀似的的眼睛，到蘇聯遇見大都從事勞作的婦女，要將她們看做熊，也是無足怪的。</p>
<p>蘇聯的女學生都是神氣十足，走進工塲實習所去看，有些還是小學生的年齡，己經在那兒搬運實習的材料。她們那股高傲的神氣，似乎是說：（我才是勞動婦女呢！）若在街頭所見的女學生，則簡直呌人想起柴　夫的（櫻桃園）裏面的（風一樣的自由）那句話來。她們剪的短頭變，穿的朴素的衣服，鞋子是平底，高根鞋大家都視爲布魯喬亞的東西而遭拒絶。女學生常常和男朋友挽了手在公圜散步，但他們挽手的形式，不是妇的的手臂掛在男子的腕上，表示地孱弱得要他扶助；而是兩人牽了手，手腕扭一下緊緊地合着，這樣表示他們的親密。</p>
<p>蘇聯白女學生和女工没有多大的區别，她們大槪都有工廠生活的經騐。平日不吃烟，不吃酒。到了陽春五月，大地復蘇，莫斯科的的公圜或其他的運動塲，總有三三五五的女學生，穿了運動鞋，夾在許多的靑年男子之中，一塊兒運動。見了她們那活潑潑的漂亮的體格，就令人感覺這便是（青春的快樂）。（未完）</p>

<h3>美棉囤户態度堅持</h3>
<p>紐約九月二十一日電告一週棉市狀况云、本週之初、原棉價格在老多頭　結與南方套賣之下、甚爲疲弱、除隅有反動買風外、需求稀少、紡織業工潮、使棉廠不即收買現棉、使同業對於期棉之結價、以舊有低價格爲限、並使棉貨市塲、繼續清淡、南方若干棉廠現己復開、但新英倫工潮形勢愈形嚴重、棉市後稍穏定、因羅總統與調解會及工部總長斐金女士晤商後、紡織業爭議有解决希望也、估計棉産似不足彭海德案所計之數量、故需求在本棉季中、不執行此案收捐條文之聲浪愈高、農部總長己於九月二十二日召開南方參議員之會議、以便討論此問題、蓋以此事在法律上頗形複雜也、南方囤户之態度、大都未變、棉市出售壓力、不致加重、以有一角二分之借欵、爲其後援也、</p>

<h3>新生活運動</h3>
<p>— 章玉卿</p>
<p>諸位親愛的小朋友們！當你吃好了夜飯，行將上床去睡的以前，應該來檢查一下，你自己今天所作的一日的課程和事情。尤其該自省的，在今日的一天之中有否違反了（新生活運動）？</p>
<p>我們應該明瞭（新生活運動）是糾正國民道德的標準運動。有了良好的國民，纔有健全的國家。旣然（新生活運動）有這樣的重要，那末我們當然是不能忽略的了，何况將來整個國家的興亡，全繫在我們兒童的身上呢！</p>
<p>（新生活運動）的意義和其效能，大槪的我們是知道了，進一步我們還應該知道，（新生活運動一這五個字面的解釋。</p>
<p>（新）就是革新的意思。比如以往的不良的舊，應該把舊馬上來剷除，重又創造出盡善（新）。</p>
<p>（生活），所謂生活者，便是我們日常和社會接觸的一切的行動。因爲一個人的生存，是不能夠離開社會的。</p>
<p>（運動），這二個字的解釋，便是抓住了某件事的中心點去做，這就呌做運動。</p>
<h3>富蘭克林的自學</h3>
<p>— 孔皆</p>
<p>富蘭克林，一位美國的科學家，同時也是有才幹的政治家。</p>
<p>他的家裏很窮苦，父親是做肥皂和蠟燭的工人。他因爲没錢入學校讀書，只得在家帮父親插燭芯或是做些雜事，空閒的時候他便讀些以極賤的價錢買來的書。</p>
<p>他先買了許多故事書讀；但他還要讀更多的書，所以他便買了這些書，更可以買書得來的錢，去買了許多的小本的歷我書。</p>
<p>他還有一個求學的方法，便是用他自己的眼晴去看各種東西，他跟父親看木匠們用刨子，鋸子做工；又看瓦匠，放好瓦塊；他還看工人做壺，做刀和做其他的東西，他細心看一切東西。</p>
<p>因爲他喜歡看書，他父親把他送到他哥哥的印刷局去。在那裏他找空閒讀，他又從隣近的書店裏借書來，費大半夜在看書上，明天一早便去歸還。他還省下他的飯錢來，只吃一些包子，葡萄等以省下的錢買書讀。</p>
<p>現在，他是歷史上的聞人了，雖然他小時只是個印刷店的學徒，他的學問是這樣得來的。</p>
<p>他不荒廢他的時間；他讀有益的書；他爲他自己看各種東西。</p>
<h3>怎樣做一個好學生？</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們這下學期的學業不是早己開始了麽？</p>
<p>（你們在這一個學期裏，打算做一個怎麽樣的學生？）倘若你們的父親問你們。</p>
<p>（我們是喜歡做一個好學生，）我想你們一定是這樣回答的。</p>
<p>但是乍怎樣去實行呢？</p>
<p>（一）誠：就是對於自己不欺騙自己，今天應該做好的功課，不要讓它拖延下去，這就是自己不欺騙自己。對别人不說謊，隨時隨地，都以坦白與眞誠示人。要知（誠）實是我們將來做一番大事業的基礎。我們怎麽可以不注意呢？</p>
<p>（二）恕：就是原諒人家，人家的甚麽對你不起的地方，也許他自有不得己的苦衷，你就應當給他一個悔過的機會，不可立卽使用報復的手段。</p>
<p>（三）愛：就是愛護人類物類，包括極其廣泛，在家庭裏愛家庭；在學校裏愛學校，也外在社會上辦事，爲國家服務，就愛社會；愛國家。</p>
<p>（四）敬：就是敬家長敬師長，也就是我們應該有的道德。我們爲什麽要敬家長師長呢？因爲家長是生我們撫養我們的。師長是敎導我們指導我們的。並且他們的學問道德都比我們高。</p>
<p>（五）互助：互助是社會生活的基礎，更其在學校裏練習是最適宜。因爲我們在學校裏，學問的研究，體魄的鍜鍊，没有一處不要互助。到了社會中去，以互助的精神和人往還，定然不會吃虧。因爲你助了人，人也要助你的。</p>
<h3>蕉芭扇</h3>

<p>芭蕉扇，扇芭蕉，莫顧名見莫思義，他的原料，它在是蒲葵而不是芭蕉。</p>
<p>小朋友呀！世間上名不副實的事兒不知多多少：願大家放出眼光來，莫被他們的名兒欺瞞了！</p>
<h3>養蟋蟀</h3>
<p>— 范</p>
<p>今年熱得那麽久長的日子，直到現在方秋風送凉，絲絲秋意，飄到人間。這秋天的當兒，有一件玩意兒也許是小朋友們不少是歡喜的，就是養蟋蟀。</p>
<p>在上海，祇有幢幢的洋樓，和平坦的馬路，没有靑草，没有瓦粒，蟋蟀當然是我們很難找到的。要是在鄕間，這幾天來蟋蟀的清脆的嗚聲，東西呼應，到處可以　得。</p>
<p>記得我在幼年時候，到了秋天。便很起勁的捉蟋蟀，爲了蟋蟀，毒蟲也不怕了。那時我捉蟋蟀的本領，自知並不高明，因爲：一則要聽清楚所要捉的那隻蟋蟀，在那堆与礫裏鳴呌；二則要以敏捷的手段，耐心而又細心，不能碰傷它，輕輕地捉住。我時常捉到的，是一隻斷了鬚，或折了腿的蟋蟀，因此我常求别人代捉，我在一旁帮忙。捉了回來，當然便舉行蟋蟀的决鬥了，那個兒，那個弱，怪有味的。</p>
<p>年紀漸長，我覺得讓蟋蟀去自相殘殺，弄得斷頭折腿，未免不忍。因此捉了來，便養在天井中的水缸底下，到晚間聽聽它底清越的鳴聲。</p>
<p>前一個更有趣，而且更容易。在未玩之前，我們先去找幾根火柴，不論六根，七根，八根都可以。找得火柴後，如（甲）圖的折成相等的叉形。火柴折好後。依（乙）圖的樣子排起來。排好後，拿一點水滴在排成的中心，瞧着火柴呀！就慢慢的開花了，變成（丙）圖。我們看要，像不像我們圖畫課上畫的花。</p>
<p>上面的科學小玩意，不是很有趣麽？如若我們要知道，這科學小玩意是什麽道理？玩末我們去問我們的自然老師。老師會很清楚的告知我們的。</p>

<h3>童話故事</h3>
<p>— 銓培作</p>
<p>（一）象兄象弟鈞了許多時，魚終鈞不到一條，於是向蛇大哥商量合作的辦法。</p>
<p>（二）蛇大哥答應了之後，便高興地下水了。</p>
<p>（三）在水中大顯身手，鈞得很多鯉魚。</p>
<p>（四）這一次他捉得一個重量的十斤的靑鯽魚。他們都快樂的說；合作的力量多麽大呀！</p>
<h3>科學小玩意</h3>
<p>— 丁合</p>
<p>現在是科學世界，我們應當找一點科學的小玩意來玩玩，助長我們研究科學的興趣。小朋友，我有幾件科學小玩意，都是很有趣的，我寫出來，讓我們一起來玩。</p>
<p>奇怪的杯子　玩這個小玩意，只須預備一隻玻璃杯，和一張薄的鉛畫紙，就可以玩。玩的方法是這樣的；玻璃杯子盛半杯冷水，照圖（一）把鉛畫紙覆在杯口，用左手掌覆在紙上，右手把杯子翻轉，如圖（二）的右手拿着杯底，左手輕輕放下，鉛畫紙就被杯口吸住，杯裏的水一點也不滴出來。如果我們的手不振動，那末這張鉛畫紙，直至給水爛掉了才落下，否則，總不會掉下，杯裏的水也不會滴出。不過，我們玩的時候，要注意的是鉛畫紙的大小，不可太大，祇須比不口稍大一點。</p>
<p>火柴的開花　啊！這個玩意兒，比</p>
<h3>秋天做甚麽？</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>在夏天，太陽逼近地球，地球就像是一個人得了熱病，寒暑表總是在百度以上。小朋友們都喊着：（熱喲！熱喲！······討厭的夏天，甚麽事都不能做喲！）</p>
<p>好容易把夏天挨遇去了，地球上的熱度己經减退；工人加緊製造，農人預備收割，······一切的工作都恢復原狀。小朋友也不再喊（熱）了，但是我現在要問小朋友；（你們秋天打算做甚麽呢）？</p>
<p>在樹底下縛一個秋千來打吧，在草地裏捉幾隻蟋蟀來鬭呢，或是問爸媽要錢來買糖炒栗子吃吧，·······如果小朋友們答覆我在秋天做這些事，那我一定要反對：因爲那是把賚貴的時間都給無爲的游戲消磨了。所以我知道凡是聰明的小朋友，他們都知道在秋天要努务自己的功課，努力自己的學業，預備造成一個有用的人材。</p>
<p>秋天的哥哥（夏）有一個火操的性情，秋天的弟弟（冬）有一個冷静的面孔，他倆都不能討我們的歡喜；只有温和的秋天才是我們的好伙伴，我們不要辜負了他的好意，和他緊緊地握着手向前進吧</p>
<h3>怎樣做一輛蘋果人力車？</h3>
<p>— 菱湖昭</p>
<p>小朋友，你們是喜歡做手工的，這裏有一件很有趣味的工藝，費一點有限的時間和功夫，便可做成一輛蘋果人力車啦！這輛人力車是無價之賫！非錢財所能買的。那緋紅中透顯出靑葱，靑葱中又泛現淡黄，這是多麽美麗，多麽可愛呵！</p>
<p>材料；二個紅蘋果，一把小刀，和四根竹籤。</p>
<p>製法：先用小刀把蘋果切成（圖r）的形狀；第二，把另一隻蘋果切成二片（圖２）的形狀；到第三步手續，便要很小心地削挖成（S）的形奘；最後，將四根竹籤削光滑，並且在兩端削尖，插在蘋果裏，像（圖４）的形狀。你瞧一輛美麗的人力車不是製造好了嗎？</p>

<p>（母親）嗚咽哭泣。</p>
<p>（兒子）咳！媽不用哭了！兒子到此地步，都是媽從小敎成的。眞是母親誤我，我負母親呀！（幕閉）</p>
<h3>中秋明月的反證</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>自來到了陰歷八月十五那一夜，總說月的光明，是比一年中滿月時來得格外分明，所以世人稱爲中秋明月，古人也有許多賞月的詩。然而何以中秋夜的月是不眞正格外分明呢？這是一個大疑問，現在把月光的原因，來說明：我們在夜間，仰望天空，有無數很美　像金銀砂樣子的星，散布空中，在這許多星中，有所謂恒星游星，衛星等，太陽原爲恒星之一，從自身放光的，而太陽又産生了許多小星，就是稱爲遊星，遊星以正常的時間，廻旋太陽的周圍，地球即爲遊星之一，其他水星，金星，木星，火星，土星，天王星，海王星，等。都是受了太陽的光的。這等游星的周圍，又有所謂衛星，也是有一定的時間，廻旋的，月亮就是地球的衛星，但月與地球的距離，比較最近，有三十八萬四千三百九十五基羅的距離，在滿月的時候，就變爲圓形，其在太陽系的衛星中，與最大的地球相比擬，好像兄弟樣子。據學者的計算，月的直徑，約地球四分之一，表面積約十分之三，體積約五十分之一，月受太陽光的反照，變爲黄色，如爲滿月時候，具有○·二四米突燭光，如在半月時，光的面積，爲滿月時二分之一，但光的强度，祇有滿月時九分之一，月在地球周圍廻轉，與月自身的旋轉時間，完全相同爲二十七日三分之一，月中黑暗的地方，稱之爲海，但是月中的海，没有水的，是指低窪的地方而言，月中最高的火山，有八千八百米突，名曰克羅丘司山，再次的爲牛頓山，高達七千二百六十四米突，其他還有五千米突的山很多，所以我們仰看月的黑白影子，是不同的，高的部分是白，低的部分是黑，而且因爲月自身的廻轉不停，每夜所見的形影，是不同的，照這樣說起來，月受太陽光的反照而明，而且因地球的遮隔，有滿月缺月之别，至於所受太陽的光，並没有什麽差異，那末，月的本身當然没有在一年中，以八月十五夜，更爲明亮時。然而自來傳說，必說八月十五夜爲中秋明月，爲什麽緣故呢？這是因爲到了秋天，氣候凉爽天空的靈　稀薄，加以我們逕過酷暑以後，到了秋夜，精神上亦覺很舒　，於是有在中秋夜賞月的興趣，其實每月到了滿月的夜，月光何嘗不明呢？中秋夜的月，未必比地月爲明啊。</p>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>我們需要自學嗎？</h3>
<p>— 公僕</p>
<p>如果我們是商店的學徒，我們是不是應該自學呢？這問題，也許有人要以爲不成其爲問題，因爲你旣是學徒，自有商店裏規定要你學的事情，旣用不着你自尋煩惱，也不允許你自尋煩惱。</p>
<p>這誠然是實在的情形，全惟其這樣，所以才有問題發生。人總是自私的，做老板的未嘗不希望伙計能够無代價地做十二小時的事，當伙計的也讦還希望能够不做事拿乾薪，當然，這些只能說是各人的幻想；最應該明白的，却是：人常常因爲自己的利益，而忽視，甚至忘記别人的利益，這不僅是限於老板和伙計的關係是如此，卽父子的關係也是如此的。我們吃别人的飯，受别人的管，如果再不替自己打算，久之，你就要忘記自己，失去自己的存在，所得的結果，必定要和你原來所希望的相反。</p>
<p>這自然不是說，商店裏規定我們學的東西，統統不是我們應該學的。我們旣是要當學徒，也就希望在商業上有點成就。譬如老板對我們說：（你們用功寫算吧。）無疑的我們應該聽從他的話，我們要做商人，不學寫算學什麽呢？</p>
<p>然而，别外，如果我們偶然翻一翻報紙，老板便要怒目瞪視。看報紙是否與我們有益呢？是十分有益的！但老板也有他自己的理由來干涉：他怕分散了我們的心，怕躭誤了我們時時間。這樣，卽使老板是好意，也不能不於無形中阻碍我們的上進，限制了我們智識的增長。我們希望做一個完全的商人，自學的問題必然就成爲非常重要的問題了。</p>
<p>人是不能孤立地生存的，一個商人也不僅是守着自己的老店便可以成功。我們不能永久是學徒，我們抹茶几，倒痰盂的事也有完的日子。我們總有一天要踏進社會；進入了社會，我們怎麽也不能揆揆算盤就拉倒我們要應付人，要應付環璄，於是，在智職上我們不能不時時刻刻作着準備。</p>
<p>就近處看，我們看到店内常有伙計被老板辭退，那些辭退的板計，是不是因爲他們的冩算不行呢？不是的，我們看到店内時刻貼着大廉價的廣告，大廉價，是不是甘願自己虧本，綸便宜到别人呢？不是的！</p>
<p>就遠處看，九一八後，無情砲火，不僅毁掉了許多有形的商店，且影響到整個商業的衰弱；商店接連的倒閉，工廠不斷的關門，聽來都與那有直接的關係。那末，究竟這是怎麽樣的一種關係呢？</p>
<p>這一切，似乎都是很大的問題，不是做學徒的人所應該知道的，但如果我們並不終身是做學徒，這些知織，却確乎是一個現代商人所必須具有的知識，不具有這些知識，你便用不着在商塲上爭生存，你便只好一生抹抹茶几，倒倒痰盂罷了。</p>
<p>然而，這不是老板所能告訴你的，也不是算盤内可以撥出來的，這裏需要的只有你自己艱苦的學習。</p>
<p>各業調查</p>
<h3>香店</h3>
<p>— 龍佑</p>
<p>關於上海的香店，首先人要提到的是牠的分佈狀况及其規模不同的這件事。說到這，我不能不驚歎上海一般居民迷信程度的可驚。作爲他們迷信的浪費之源的香店，在上海大小一共有一百五六十家之多。這些香店在華界的數目遠過於租界的數目；這是因爲租界房租昻貴，多數香店老板大都不會在算盤上撥到這一筆可省的額外開銷，而願安然在華界的偏僻街道上佔一個角落。租界上的香店只有廖廖可數的幾空門市，牠的作廠仍是坐落在華界的居多，這原因也就不難找到的了。</p>
<p>說到上海香店的分佈，我要指出閘北，南市兩處是香店最多最密集的地方。閘北從新閘橋起沿着大統路一直走到盡頭，你在這條路上若果仔細去搜尋的話，有十多家的香店會被你發現的。共和新路，虬江路，中山路（閘北段），宋公園路·····以及太陽廟左近，新橋左近，都有多則七八家，少則二三家的香店點綴着。南市香店之多有這同樣情形。光是在城内那小圈子裏聽說就人八九家之多，此外，高昌廟，龍華路，製造局路，斜土路，董家渡······都有不少的香店。其次，浦東和地要算是香店次多的地方了。如爛泥渡，楊家渡，唐橋，南碼頭，洋涇······各地，都有多則七八家，少則二三家的香店。滬西曹家渡（五角塲一帶），周家橋，北新涇，等地方也都有不少的香店。</p>
<p>上面所說的香店，有規模資本充足的固不少，但也有不少簡陋得簡直難於令人相信的。最大的香店，多半有門市和作廠兩部；其中作廠大半是靠近郊外，又與門市相隔不遠。香店的門市用的人不會很多；普通一位賬房先生自然是少不掉的，其餘就可省則省了。大香店間或也有多請一兩位店夥照應門市和包香的，但多數香店則僅利用剛出師的學徒的低廉勞動力或學徒的無條件的服役，而不别僱什麽人的。</p>
<p>還有一種香店，因爲没有租用門市的經濟能力，而不得不心一幢弄堂房子或一所中國式的平房爲滿足了。他們把這作爲根據地，在這裏兼營門市和批發的生意。不消說，這裏也是他們的作廠。他們僱不起職員，有時甚至連一位賬房先生也都用不起。雖這末說，但這種香店還不是香店中規模最小的一種。最小的香店多半是與近郊的棚户和農家爲鄰，他們住在低濕簡陋的房子裏，作起來也不過兩三担香，出品自然談不到門市的銷路，只希望在附近的小街小鎭有些小數的批發生意而己。牠們實際上說不上是香店，只能算是香作。</p>
<p>說到香作，則有規模的香店的作廠在這裏是有一提的必要了。大槪各香店老板除了少數以外，都不大過問作香的事。老板登在門市的時間多，到作廠裏去的時間少。但作廠裏却也並非没有負指揮工作責任的人。一個一老司務）就是在作廠裏支配一切的人。他多半是一個年長而又富於經騐的脚色。他須能觀天象，有指揮能力。雨天不能晒香，是不利於作香的，老司務這時就必須觀察某一天的天氣如何，而决定作香配料的多寡。在篩香，配香，作香的過程中，他又須注視着各人的工作，而在必要時加以指示。他自己本身也是要從事工作的，不過所作的是（上籮）（卽把濕的香一根一根排在香籮上好拿去晒）和一些（上莊）作的技術方面的細工，不作（下莊）作的那些篩香，壓香等粗工罷了。</p>

<p>(Beiping) After Huang Fu returned to Beiping, regarding the war zone issue, he decided to follow the central government's established policy and begin reorganization, generally adhering to two principles: (1) to find ways to resolve various problems that have already occurred; (2) to make every effort to prevent and avoid those that have not yet occurred. It is also heard that a War Zone Reorganization Committee will be established in the shortest possible time, consisting of seven members, to be filled by representatives appointed by the relevant agencies. Currently, it is planned that the Political Reorganization Committee, the Military Sub-committee, the Hebei Provincial Government, the Ji-Mi Administrative District, and the Luan-Yu Administrative District will each send one person, with two others from other fields. After the establishment of the committee, its work guidelines will have two points: (1) to reorganize all issues within the war zone; (2) to study general issues within the war zone.

<p>Chairman Lin Reports on His Life and Achievements</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Chairman Lin led the ceremony at the fourth anniversary memorial for the late Premier Tan, he reported on the events and process of the state funeral for the late sage. The original text stated, "The late Premier's given name was Yankai, his courtesy name was Zu'an, and he styled himself Yequan. He was born in Chaling, Hunan, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month of the Yimao year of the Guangxu reign (1880) at the Hangzhou Governor's Office, when his father, the late Duke Wenqin, was serving as the Governor of Zhejiang. In the Renchen year of Guangxu, he entered the prefectural school. In the Dingyou year, he passed the examination for superior tribute student.

He was publicly recommended as the Governor of Hunan. In the first year of the Republic of China, the government appointed him as the Governor of Hunan and concurrently the Chief of Civil Affairs. In the second year, due to suspicions of the Second Revolution, Tang Xiangming was appointed as the Governor of Hunan. He took his parents to Qingdao and moved to Shanghai the following year. In the fourth year, Yuan Shikai died of illness, and Xiangming abandoned his post. The government reappointed him as the Military Governor of Hunan and concurrently the Provincial Governor. In October, he mourned his mother and escorted her coffin back to Hunan for burial. In the fifth year, the government appointed Chuan Liangzuo as the Military Governor of Hunan. He returned to Shanghai. The Hunan-Guangxi Allied Army of the Constitutional Protection Forces entered Hunan, and Chuan Liangzuo abandoned his post. In the sixth year, the Northern Government sent Cao Kun, Wu Peifu, and Zhang Jingyao to attack Hunan. Cheng Qian, the commander-in-chief of the Hunan Army, retreated to Chenzhou. Previously, the Southwestern Constitutional Protection Government ordered him to occupy Hunan. He took the road from Guangdong to Guilin and stationed in Yongzhou. In the seventh year, he was in Yongzhou. In August of the eighth year, the generals of the Hunan Army welcomed him to move to Chenzhou. In the ninth year, they joined forces to drive out the Northern Army, and in June, they captured Changsha. He took the position of commander-in-chief to govern Hunan. In October, he resigned and returned to Shanghai. In the eleventh year, Sun Yat-sen came to Shanghai, and he sought his teachings day and night, seeking to save the country. The Northern Government summoned him as the Minister of Internal Affairs, but he declined. He was awarded the second-class Order of Merit, but he also refused. In February of the twelfth year, he accompanied Sun Yat-sen to Guangdong and served as the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Generalissimo's Headquarters, and was transferred to Minister of Construction. In June, he served as the commander of the Hunan Army of the Punitive Expeditionary Forces, ordered to enter Hunan. In October, he led his troops back to Guangdong.

In January of the thirteenth year, the Kuomintang was reorganized, and he served as a standing committee member of the first Central Executive Committee and as the Secretary-General of the Generalissimo's Headquarters. In October, he concurrently served as the commander-in-chief of the Northern Expeditionary Army of the National Revolutionary Army. In November, Sun Yat-sen went north and ordered him to be fully responsible for the Northern Expedition, with all Northern Expeditionary forces under his control and dispatch. In June of the fourteenth year, the Yunnan Army rebelled. He, Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, Liao Zhongkai, and other gentlemen decided to use the Hunan and Guangdong armies to defend Whampoa. Soon the Party Army returned from the Dongjiang River and jointly defeated Yang and Liu, restoring Guangzhou. In July, the National Government was established, and he served as a standing committee member of the National Government's Military Affairs Committee and concurrently as the Minister of Military Affairs and the commander of the Second Army of the National Revolutionary Army.

<h3>Old Stamps to Be Abolished Starting in November</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Starting from November 1st, the Ministry of Finance will change to using pagoda-style new stamp tax stamps, which will be entrusted to the Ministry of Communications and sold by post offices in various places. County governments in various places will strictly investigate cases of missed stamps. Old stamps will be invalid when they expire. Many merchants and people in various places have petitioned the government to withdraw its order and allow old stamps to be exchanged for new stamps. Their reasons are: (1) Merchants and people cannot bear the burden of losses from old stamps; (2) Stamp tax and postage stamps are similar in nature, and there has never been a case of old postage stamps being abolished when new postage stamps are issued. The same should be true for stamp tax stamps. The Ministry of Finance believes: (1) In the past, merchants and people often bought stamp tax stamps and stored them in boxes. Many contracts did not have stamp tax stamps affixed; (2) Currently, old stamps are only worth more than 2 million, which is only enough to use until October; (3) A small number of speculators plan to buy old stamps at low prices to exchange them for new stamps and profit. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance decided to reject the petition. According to the Ministry of Finance, the annual stamp tax revenue is 15 million. According to experts, after rectification, it can reach 60 million. In the future, the tax revenue distribution will be 6% for the Ministry of Communications, 10% for the provincial government, 30% for the county government, and 54% for the Ministry of Finance. However, in remote provinces, the provincial government will receive 30%, so the Ministry of Finance will only receive 34%. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Therefore, today's oath is to express the anti-smoking committee's own restraint and its commitment to the people, to eliminate the malpractices of anti-smoking in the past, to change the people's previous doubts, to follow the anti-smoking methods, and to work diligently to achieve the goal of anti-smoking and complete the anti-smoking work in Jiangsu Province.

<p>Hoping Related Nations Will Cooperate</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, during the League of Nations Fifth Committee's discussion on opium and dangerous drugs, the Chinese representative, Hu Shih-tse, explained in detail China's six-year plan for opium suppression. Representatives from various countries expressed satisfaction and hoped that China's new plan could be completed on schedule. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Fifth Committee (Humanitarian and Social Issues) continued its discussion on the opium problem. The Chinese representative, Hu Shih-tse, delivered a moving speech. The main points are excerpted below. Mr. Hu first thanked the rapporteur, saying that his memorandum was quite helpful, but expressed regret that while the true goal was to generally reduce narcotics, the amount of illegal trafficking had not decreased. Therefore, he supported the plans proposed by the Spanish representative, Garcia Robles, and the Venezuelan representative, Parra Perez, to seek further measures to suppress drugs. Mr. Hu then mentioned the statement made by the British representative, Ms. Hall-Holt. (When Ms. Hall-Holt discussed the opium problem at the League of Nations Narcotics Committee in late September 1933, she had a debate with Hu Shih-tse. Ms. Hall-Holt repeatedly advocated conducting an investigation into the narcotics trade situation in China. Mr. Hu said that this matter involved concession areas and extraterritoriality issues, and should be addressed through the earnest cooperation of the related nations. Furthermore, Chinese courts severely punish private traffickers, and so on.) He said that China does not grow coca leaves and therefore cannot manufacture cocaine. Mr. Hu also stated that China seizes a large amount of narcotics, all of which come from Europe. China suffers more from foreign narcotics than other countries, and therefore has more reason to be dissatisfied. At present, there are territories in China that are not under the direct administrative control of China, and narcotics are also seized in these places. Mr. Hu then raised objections to the situation in China as described in the memorandum, because the rapporteur had included the phrase "opium production in China is almost unrestricted" in the memorandum. Mr. Hu did not acknowledge this statement, because Mr. Hu and Fuller (the American representative who had previously attacked China on the opium issue) originally meant that opium production in China had increased. This statement is clearly different from unrestricted production. Since May, the Chinese government has taken various measures to restrict narcotics, which will be strictly enforced. These measures are used to deal with narcotics and opium, and the punishment for narcotics is even more severe than for opium, because China's policy is to first eradicate narcotics and then solve the opium problem. The new measures regarding narcotics involve extremely severe punishments, even the death penalty. Hospitals have been established in various important locations in China, and those harmed by narcotics are forcibly sent for treatment, with severe punishment for those who refuse. This measure has been drafted into regulations and distributed to all provinces, which must be implemented within ten days of receipt. It can be seen that China is paying attention to this matter. As for opium, the Chinese government has had to allow smoking under certain circumstances, such as for the elderly, which is the most obvious example. However, smoking is only allowed after a license has been issued. The reason for this accommodation is to prevent addicts from turning to other narcotics. Regarding poppies, the new regulations stipulate a ban on planting for a period of one to six years, and inspectors are appointed to be responsible for the implementation of the new regulations, even the military is responsible for this. Mr. Hu expressed reservations regarding the amount of anhydrous acetic acid imported into China from foreign countries as stated in the memorandum. The National Opium Prohibition Committee has petitioned the government to treat this substance as a narcotic, and this matter is currently under study. In short, the Chinese government has taken all necessary measures to eliminate the harm of narcotics, but it can only be effective with the cooperation of other countries. Mr. Hu expressed his support for submitting various resolutions to the general assembly, hoping that they would be included in the report of the general assembly. Mr. Hu then said that the cooperation between China and the countries with concession areas in China has become relatively close, and he hopes that all related countries can cooperate. Yesterday, the Italian representative, Cavazzini, advocated seeking help from spiritual forces to solve this problem. Mr. Hu agreed with this idea and concluded by quoting Confucius: "Do not do unto others what you do not want done to yourself." (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Arms Shipments to Belligerents Should Not Be Applied Equally</h3>
<p>The Responsibility for War Must First Be Determined</p>
<p>Chinese Representative Expresses Views</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations First Committee (Organization and Legal Issues) began discussing the issue of prohibiting arms shipments to Bolivia and Paraguay in South America today. After representatives from Italy, the United States, Sweden, Switzerland, and France spoke in succession, the Chinese representative, Liang Long, expressed his views, saying that prohibiting arms shipments to belligerent countries without first determining responsibility for the war would reduce the ability of the country being aggressed against to resist. Mr. Liang agreed with the views of the Italian representative and pointed out the harm of prohibiting arms without specifying the responsibility for the war. The Greek representative, Politis, spoke from a purely legal standpoint, saying that any country has the right to prohibit arms shipments to other countries. Finally, the Bolivian representative said that there were two special situations that were particularly serious: one was implementing a prohibition on arms shipments without adopting a definition of aggressor, and the other was that, in accordance with the spirit of the arms prohibition covenant, it must be implemented unanimously, but now it is intended to be passed by a majority vote. The next meeting is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>US Arms Investigation Reveals Japan's Ambition for War Preparation</h3>
<p>Military Materials Imported into Japan Increase Sharply</p>
<p>(Washington) Testimony obtained at the Senate Arms Investigation Committee today again involved Japan. Tu Bo, director of the Foreign Trade Statistics Division of the Department of Commerce, stated that Japan's purchases of raw materials needed for war have greatly increased. In 1929, Japan purchased only three bales of short-staple cotton, but in 1933, it increased to 10,000 bales. In 1931, Japan purchased only 48,036 tons of scrap iron, but in the first six months of this year, it exceeded 500,000 tons. Mr. Tu also stated that the export of short-staple cotton seed fiber and aircraft engines from the United States to Germany has also greatly increased recently. The investigation committee adjourned today until the end of November, but the chairman stated that the committee has not yet thoroughly investigated the arms trade. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Arms Investigation Committee has now announced its adjournment and will reconvene in November. At the meeting today, Senator Clark criticized the US Army, blaming it for helping to sell arms and undermining Congress's arms embargo bill. Although today's investigation committee was the last regular meeting, the committee chairman, Senator Nye, may convene a special meeting tomorrow. (Republic of China dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<h3>My Request to Halve Membership Fees Makes People in the League of Nations Uneasy</h3>
<p>If Our Goal is Not Achieved, We Are Prepared to Vote Against the Budget</p>
<p>Britain Proposes an Amendment, French and Italian Representatives Declare It Difficult to Increase the Burden</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese representative, Guo Taiqi, requested today in the League of Nations Fourth Committee that the League of Nations membership fee be reduced by half. This matter has made people in the League of Nations uneasy, because China is now threatening to veto the League of Nations budget when it is submitted if the request is not granted. According to the rules, the League of Nations budget must be unanimously approved to pass. If China votes against it, the work of the League of Nations will be completely stalled. However, most countries have expressed sympathy for China's position. Britain today proposed an amendment to the method of allocating membership fees, with each of the four permanent members of the League of Nations Administrative Council paying 105 units in membership fees. As a result, the fees paid by France, Italy, and Russia would be the same as those currently paid by Britain, and other countries could thereby reduce their membership fees by 5%. However, the Italian representative declared that Italy could not increase its burden of membership fees. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Ridicules Japan</h3>
<p>Manchuria After the September 18th Incident is No Longer a Paradise</p>
<p>A Self-Proclaimed Messenger of Peace Will Inevitably Fail</p>
<p>(Washington) The Baltimore Sun published an editorial titled "Japan, the So-Called Messenger of Peace," stating that when Japan occupied Manchuria three years ago, it claimed to be maintaining law and order in the area, but after Japan's troops entered and occupied Manchuria, it actually carried out a long-term occupation, obviously for other reasons. In fact, how has Japan progressed in restoring law and order in Manchuria? It is worth noting that restoring law and order was the only reason given by the Japanese for seizing Manchuria. The Japanese and the Manchurian puppet state now claim that Manchuria has become a paradise, but news from China is the opposite. Evidence from American correspondents and neutral observers suggests that the Chinese reports are more accurate. Peng Dafu, an expert at the American Foreign Relations Association and a former consultant to the Lytton Investigation Commission, said that the "Manchukuo" and Japan are currently spending money and effort fighting "bandits." Since 1931, Japan has conducted no less than thousands of military operations to suppress bandits. Therefore, Mr. Peng said that based on the above facts, it is difficult to determine whether the law and order enjoyed by Manchuria today is the same as before the September 18th Incident. The editor of the newspaper wrote that although Japan calls itself a "messenger of peace," it does not seem to have succeeded. If Japan proposes an Asian Monroe Doctrine in the future, or claims to be the guardian of peace in the Far East, we should not forget the fact that Japan has failed in Manchuria.

<h3>American Journalist Delegation Receives Gracious Treatment from Japan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A Tokyo dispatch on the 21st reported that in order to improve American public opinion towards Japan and its puppet regime, the Japanese Newspaper Association has invited leading newspaper representatives from various parts of the United States and their families to visit Japan and the puppet state of Manchuria. The group of 26 people arrived in Tokyo on the 18th. The Japanese Emperor, Prime Minister, Ministers of the Army and Navy, zaibatsu, and officials from all walks of life are exerting their utmost to provide hospitality, with all travel expenses, food, and lodging being provided by the Japanese side. Discussion meetings will also be held by major Japanese newspapers to exchange views. The representatives are scheduled to depart for various parts of the puppet state of Manchuria via Nagoya, Kobe, Shimonoseki, and Korea on the first of next month, return to Japan on the 15th, and return to the United States on the 25th. It is also reported that the representatives mostly want to travel to China, but due to obstruction from a certain party, they may not be able to make the trip.

<h3>Japanese Air Squadron Returns from Harbin to Changchun</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Three Japanese naval aircraft and seventy-eight land aircraft, a total of eighty-one aircraft, arrived here yesterday and will go to Changchun and Dalian today. The commander-in-chief of the Manchurian mixed fleet, Vice Admiral Suetsugu, arrived in Harbin yesterday by plane and has now returned to Changchun by train with his entourage.

<h3>The Relationship Between Russia and France</h3>
<p>Compromise Between the Two Countries Is Limited to European Issues</p>
<p>France Avoids Being Drawn into the Vortex of Conflicts in the Far East</p>
<p>(Paris) Senator Bérenger, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, recently wrote an article on the rapprochement between France and Russia, which will be published tomorrow by the Economic and Financial Communications Agency. The article states that if France and Soviet Russia get closer, and the relationship between Moscow and Tokyo becomes tense, causing a conflict between Soviet Russia and Japan in the Far East, will France be in danger of being drawn in? This can be avoided by France's diplomatic approach. (France has had friendly relations with Japan for many years because of Annam, and these good diplomatic relations will be maintained and, if necessary, strengthened. The compromise between France and Soviet Russia is limited to European issues and cannot be applied to any Asian events.) Bérenger also said that although Soviet Russia and France have reached a diplomatic compromise, the internal affairs of the two countries are absolutely independent of each other. Before the European War, France and Russia were allies, and at that time Russia was an empire and France was a republic, which did not interfere with each other. This reservation does not violate the League of Nations Covenant and is in line with historical events. Under this reservation, the rapprochement between Russia and France is to consolidate security and stabilize France's diplomacy. The fundamental problems of the Danube cannot be solved by this, but Europe, which is increasingly threatened by Pan-Germanism, will maintain its balance of power. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Has No Intention of Withdrawing Troops Stationed on the Manchurian Border</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Foreign rumors have it that the Soviet Russian military authorities intend to withdraw the transport teams stationed on the Manchurian border. According to reliable sources, this statement is completely inaccurate. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Turmoil in Russian Turkestan, British Telegraph Reports</h3>
<p>Refugees Fleeing to Afghanistan</p>
<p>(London) A Times correspondent in Simla, India, reports that there has recently been a major riot in the Kazakhastan province of the four provinces of Russian Turkestan, and refugees are fleeing to Afghanistan. It is said that the Russian authorities used fierce artillery fire to quell the rebellion, destroying a large number of civilian houses and arresting a large number of people.

<h3>The United States and Russia Reopen Negotiations on Debt Issues</h3>
<p>The Situation Is Better Than Before</p>
<p>(Washington) Debt negotiations between the United States and Russia have now resumed. According to news from the State Department today, the two countries have recently reopened negotiations in a more satisfactory situation than before. The Russian ambassador, when speaking to people about this matter, also said that the situation is more hopeful than before, and his words were quite optimistic. According to previous reports, the negotiations were suspended because the United States demanded that Americans be compensated for the confiscation of their property in Russia under the Russian nationalization law of 1918, estimated to be worth approximately 400 million US dollars.

<h3>Hauptmann, Suspect in the Lindbergh Kidnapping Case, Is Interrogated</h3>
<p>Hauptmann, of German Nationality, Has a History of Misconduct</p>
<p>Denies in Testimony Receiving Ransom Money</p>
<p>(New York) Hauptmann, a suspect in the Lindbergh kidnapping case, was arrested yesterday and brought to the Bronx courthouse today for interrogation on charges of swindling. According to Dr. Condon's report, Hauptmann improperly received $50,000 from Dr. Condon at St. Raymond's Cemetery on the night of May 2, 1932, which was held by Condon to be used to redeem Lindbergh's son. Today, the court briefly questioned him and then ordered the defendant to be detained. When Hauptmann was escorted to the court, the crowd gathered and shouted angrily, threatening to attack him en masse. Fortunately, armed detectives were on guard, and trouble was avoided. New Jersey Governor Moore has now signed a document requesting that Hauptmann be extradited from New York for trial in order to be charged with intentional homicide. Hauptmann has not yet admitted to being involved in the kidnapping or receiving the ransom money paid by Lindbergh. The money found by the police in his house was given by a friend named Fisch, who died in Germany in December. However, Hauptmann was unable to explain where Fisch got the money. Hauptmann was born in Chemnitz, Germany, and entered the United States ten years ago. According to reports from Chemnitz, Hauptmann had a history of misconduct in his youth and had been sentenced to four years in prison. His mother is still alive. It is reported that the police chief said today that Dr. Condon was unable to clearly identify Hauptmann, but the police station has a complete fraud case against him, which is more serious. The police chief also said that Hauptmann's image is generally the same as that described by Condon, and Hauptmann's handwriting matches the ransom notes. It is reported that the wooden ladder used in the kidnapping of Lindbergh's son seems to have been made by the kidnappers themselves. Hauptmann worked as a carpenter in Hopewell, not far from Lindbergh's residence, but stopped working in this profession after the kidnapping case occurred. This is also a clue that can be investigated. According to news from Los Angeles, the Lindberghs have remained hidden since arriving in Los Angeles, keeping their movements secret. They now plan to fly back to New York. They expected that this case would eventually be solved. According to their close friends, the Lindberghs do not wish to make any statements other than to the authorities. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since Hauptmann, the suspect in the kidnapping of Colonel Lindbergh's son, was arrested in New York, German newspapers have published as much news about the case as possible, and the general public is also very concerned about it. The German semi-official news agency is also searching everywhere for various past deeds of Hauptmann. It is said that Hauptmann was born thirty-five years ago in Hainichen, Saxony, Germany, so he is German. His mother currently lives in a poor area of the town, living in very difficult conditions. His father died in 1917, and his two brothers died in the European War. He was originally named Richard and was actually the worst of the family. He was imprisoned as a child for committing a crime and was later pardoned, but at the age of twenty-three, he committed another crime and was sentenced to imprisonment. However, he escaped from prison while temporarily confined in an old dilapidated house before being sent to a state prison. Since then, Richard has disappeared, and even his old mother does not know where he has gone. (Republic of China dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>The American Textile Strike Reveals a Glimmer of Resolution</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press learned today from reliable sources that if the textile industry authorities accept the methods of the Central Mediation Committee, the textile industry strike could end within this week. If the employers are willing to accept mediation, the workers are also willing to do so. The silk industry is already willing to reconcile according to the methods recommended by the Mediation Committee, but the cotton textile industry is only willing to consider the recommendations of the Mediation Committee. President Roosevelt's personal order to the union to end the strike has greatly moved the union leaders. The President has issued a formal statement asking textile workers to return to work and hoping that factories will not discriminate against workers and will still employ them. The President declared that the strike is now being resolved in a spirit of cooperation and openness on both sides, and he fully supports the report of the Mediation Committee.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Disappearance of Japanese Soldier Fujiwara</h3>
<p>International relations value sincerity. Only with sincerity can we be candid with each other and help each other. If we do not seek this, but only pursue deceit and trickery, engage in conspiracies, wield brute force, harbor malicious intentions, reverse right and wrong, confuse black and white, or even impose unfounded charges on the weak, and still tout the virtues of good neighborliness in order to gain the trust of others, who can trust us?</p>
<p>The third anniversary of the September 18th Incident has passed in an atmosphere of national grief, indignation, and sorrow. If the Japanese had even a shred of sincerity towards us, this incident would not have occurred in the first place, nor would it have progressed step by step, treating the puppet state of Manchuria as a forbidden fruit. However, the reality is as such, and there is probably no day left for regretting the disaster. The only remaining glimmer of hope is that the Japanese intellect will be slightly activated and that no more evil consequences will be planted to be reaped.</p>
<p>However, the difficulty of the matter may be equal to "seeking the skin of a tiger." Do not look at how Chinese sojourners in Japan are cruelly expelled, disregarding our protests, and the disappearance of Fujiwara in Tianjin will again be an excuse for them to provoke trouble without reason.</p>
<p>According to a Tianjin dispatch in our newspaper yesterday, a private first class soldier Fujiwara Tatsuo disappeared days ago. Japanese soldiers falsely accused our villagers of murder. If the Japanese use this to escalate the matter, they will be trying to follow in the footsteps of the Nakamoto disappearance case. At the beginning of the Nakamoto disappearance, the Japanese mobilized troops and dispatched warships, creating a menacing situation. Once the truth came out, they retreated in disappointment. We thought that after this lesson, the Japanese would be more cautious when encountering similar facts and would not be so suspicious and make such a slanderous move. It is unexpected that the truth has not yet been clarified, but they have already falsely accused our villagers of murder. Their intention is nothing more than to create a second Nakamura Incident to satisfy their great desire. If Fujiwara is not found soon, will he not also jump to become a hero of his country?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Fujiwara is just a Japanese soldier stationed in Tianjin. The presence of Japanese soldiers in Tianjin is based on the Boxer Protocol. The shackles of unequal treaties have long been unbearable for us, but the Japanese still want to add fuel to the fire, fearing that they are not doing enough.</p>
<p>Historically, foreign nationals residing in a country must be subject to the laws of the country of residence before they can be protected by the government of the country of residence. Moreover, the degree of protection cannot exceed that of the citizens of that country. Today, Japanese nationals in China are usually shielded by consular jurisdiction, which we cannot directly interfere with. Once something happens, they want to pass the responsibility of inadequate protection to us. By any standard, how can this be considered fair? Ordinary Japanese nationals can still roam outside our country's laws, let alone armed soldiers. The actions of the Japanese troops stationed in China are not subject to our government's judgment. If there are missing persons or other circumstances, it is natural that only their direct superior should be responsible.</p>
<p>To then blame us, it is a dereliction of duty to yourself and a slander against others. Staying in this position, it is only enough to tarnish yourself.</p>
<p>The Japanese suicide rate is particularly high in the world. Who can guarantee that there will be no suicides among so many Japanese nationals and soldiers? Fortunately, Nakamoto before and Fujiwara now were able to return safely. Various disputes naturally disappeared. If, due to their own personal reasons, they committed suicide, and the truth of their suicide was not easily clarified, then if they said that we murdered them, how could we defend ourselves even with a hundred mouths? If it is said that we must send police to protect each and every Japanese national and soldier today, then we can exempt ourselves from innocence. I ask, is this allowed by facts, and does any country in the world have this strange situation?</p>
<p>Perhaps it will be said that the relationship between China and Japan is bad, and the Japanese know this very well. The emergence of suspicion is for this reason. If this is the case, then today, for the sake of the Japanese, we must cultivate virtue, stop resentment, make amends, and correct mistakes to show the sincerity of our position. Why not pay attention to this?</p>
<h3>More Than 7,000 Japanese Casualties in Wind Disaster</h3>
<p>Elementary School Students Account for Majority of Casualties</p>
<p>Osaka Suffers 500 Million Yuan in Losses</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Home Affairs announced tonight that as of 9 p.m. tonight, the reports received from various places regarding the typhoon disaster totaled 1,661 dead, 5,414 injured, and 562 missing.

<h3>Ethnic Minority Disputes Cause Rifts in League of Nations</h3>

<h3>Tense Relations Between Italy and Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Newspapers in Both Countries Continue to Attack Each Other Wantonly</p>
<p>French Mediation Will Be in Vain</p>
<p>Rome: The tense relations between Italy and Yugoslavia have now worsened. The Italian government recently recalled its representatives attending the Belgrade International Parliamentary Conference midway from Venice. However, general public opinion in Yugoslavia continues to attack Italy wantonly, making the situation even more dangerous. For example, the semi-official Yugoslav media outlet Vreme newspaper even denounced (the Italian army as having hereditary cowardice). As a result, the Italian Foreign Ministry's official newspaper, Italian Daily, has proposed severing diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia, stating that (it is absolutely impossible to maintain any form of relationship between the two countries in the future, let alone reach a compromise). As for France's intention to mediate, the newspaper has also flatly rejected it, claiming that this is something that no illegal government can do, and stating that (the political systems of the two countries are fundamentally different, and for countries like Italy and Yugoslavia, there is no possibility of reconciliation other than holding Yugoslavia accountable).

<h3>Disaster Losses in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>49,453,000 Mu of Farmland Affected</p>
<p>Accounting for 0.54% of the Total Farmland Area</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: Since the beginning of summer this year, the counties south of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province have experienced a severe drought with scarce rainfall, causing cracks in the soil. In a few counties, locusts have also appeared, resulting in a dire situation. Although there was a slight rain after autumn, it was a drop in the bucket and came too late to be of any help. The provincial departments have received a flood of dispatches from various counties reporting the drought. The Departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction have each dispatched personnel to conduct on-site investigations in the disaster areas to obtain a comprehensive picture of the disaster and assess the losses, which will serve as the basis for future disaster relief and tax reductions. The disaster investigation specialists dispatched by the various departments have returned to the province one after another and are drafting detailed reports. The total area of affected farmland is 49,453,000 mu, accounting for 0.54% of the total farmland area in Jiangsu Province. The total estimated loss of major crops is over 21.8 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Accelerate Construction of the Chao-Re Road</h3>

<h3>Current Situation of the French Political Scene (French Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Political Coping Adequacy, Diplomatic Agility</p>
<p>Economic Overstretched, Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>Europe is filled with war clouds everywhere, especially in Central Europe and the Baltic Sea area. In Central Europe, Austria is the center. Austria was one of the powerful countries in Europe before the war. After the war, it lost troops and ceded land, so it had to rely on others. Although it exports a little luxury goods economically, it has no access to the sea, and its agriculture cannot be self-sufficient. Therefore, its economic situation has fallen into a desperate situation. It can only rely on the League of Nations for a little help. In terms of ethnic relations, Germans account for 94% of the total population, so there is a greater possibility of political closeness to Germany. Therefore, it has become the only focus of contention among France, Italy, and Germany.</p>
<p>The assassination of Dollfuss was really a moment of crisis. Italian troops were dispatched to the border, taking a strict surveillance attitude. Czechoslovakia was also prepared. France at that time had to secretly be on alert. A cabinet member once said that if one Italian soldier crossed the Austrian border, France would prepare for full mobilization. From this, we can know the tension at that time. Fortunately, the assassin of Dollfuss was a member of the Austrian National Socialist Party and had nothing to do with Germany. The incident itself did not expand much. Hitler's attitude was especially cautious, even dismissing Habicht, the Minister of Supervision of the National Socialist Party for Bavaria, to reduce the criticism from various countries. Therefore, France tried its best to show calmness and adopted a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>But in fact, she still did not relax her international activities. She understood that the Versailles system had been shaken. Poland's friendly relations with Germany made France's European hegemony have a symbol of collapse in a corner of Eastern Europe. As a result of Barthou's travels to various countries, it proved that her satellites were prone to division without the transformation of new forces. One was to show goodwill to Italy, and the other was to follow Poland. So she decided to win over the Soviet Union. This is not only a diplomatic closeness, but also a political understanding that is getting closer. Because their common goal is to contain Germany. As long as Germany is contained, it will not be difficult to maintain the status quo of peace in Europe. Recently, the entire international diplomacy of France has been on this point.</p>
<p>As for the domestic economic situation in France, the surface seems to be good, and there are not many unemployed workers. But we know that most of the workers in French factories are recruited from the countryside. When there is no work to do, they return to the countryside. So there are not many unemployed people gathered in the cities. The economic phenomenon is not so bad, but France is trying to maintain the gold standard, so it has to implement financial austerity. The consumption of the general public has shrunk accordingly. For example, the general price index (according to the benchmark of July 1914) was 388 in January this year, 378 in April, and fell to 361 in July. Among them, the domestic manufactured products were 434 in January this year, 421 in April, and only 400 in July. As for foreign goods, the index in January this year was 305, 300 in April, and 291 in July. And exports are still quite prosperous, and market competition is very chaotic. The usual view is that since she has set up high tariff barriers, she should be able to prevent the import of foreign goods, and domestic manufactured products should be able to obtain real benefits. But because countries are desperately looking for overseas markets and rejecting the import of foreign goods, France has suffered a big loss. From January to July this year, the total number of foreign trade exports was 1,015 million francs, and the imports were 1,432.8 million francs, which is a decrease compared with last year. Especially the trade volume in July was only 34% of that in 1929.</p>
<p>Since foreign trade is shrinking, the total production index (based on 1913) was 106 in January this year and fell to 99 in July. The government's finances will of course be affected. The budget for this year is insufficient. It was previously estimated to be 4 billion francs. When the Doumergue national unity cabinet was organized, it tried its best to demand a balanced budget, but there has been no improvement until recently. The total revenue for the summer season this year was 889.4 million francs, which is 87.4 million francs less than the budget. Combined with the spring revenue, the shortfall is 155.2 million francs. The annual deficit is estimated to be 3 billion francs. This is the deepening of her economic panic. The number of unemployed people has increased, the number of bankruptcies has increased, the national treasury revenue has decreased, and the consumption power of the general society is low. If this continues, I am afraid that the gold standard will not be maintained, and the hegemony of the franc will also be shaken. (August 18, 1934, in Paris)</p>

<h3>National Inter-Railway Transportation Conference</h3>
<p>Seven-Day Meeting Held in Qingdao</p>
<p>Over 300 Proposals Submitted</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The 17th National Inter-Railway Transportation Conference and the 19th Accounting Conference commenced at 10:00 AM on the 20th of this month in the auditorium of the Jiaoji Railway Bureau. Over 90 representatives from the Ministry of Railways and various railway lines attended. Participants included Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie, Jiaoji Railway Committee Chairman Ge Guangting, Committee members Lu Mengxiong, Cui Shijie, Chen Yanminwen, and others. Yu, the Director of the Business Department and Head of the Inter-Railway Transportation Department of the Ministry of Railways, presided over and delivered the opening address. This was followed by an address from the Minister of Railways (represented by Xia Guangyu, a consultant from the Ministry). Finally, Shen Honglie and Ge Guangting delivered speeches in succession. The ceremony concluded at 12:00 noon with a group photograph, after which the meeting adjourned. At 3:00 PM, the meeting resumed to discuss the submitted proposals, which totaled over 320 from various railway lines. The conference will last for seven days, with the closing ceremony scheduled for the 26th. The opening address by the Chairman and the address by the Minister of Railways are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Opening Address: (The National Inter-Railway Transportation Conference has been held sixteen times in the past, and the Accounting Conference eighteen times. This session marks the 17th National Inter-Railway Transportation Conference and the 19th Accounting Conference. The location of the conference was determined based on the assumption made at the previous conference and approved by the Ministry. Since the close of the last conference, a year has passed in an instant. On this occasion, I would like to report on the progress of inter-railway transportation work during this year, and the achievements made, highlighting the most significant aspects as follows: (A) Passenger Inter-Railway Transportation: Regarding passenger inter-railway transportation, activities included launching through train services between Shanghai and Peiping, reorganizing through train services between Peiping and Pukou, improving all equipment, establishing measures for passenger inter-railway transportation between Shanghai and Hankou, the incorporation of the Xiang-E Railway and the Zhe-Gan Railway into the national inter-railway transportation system, improving the sealing and delivery of luggage and parcels, establishing methods for inter-railway luggage labels, expanding inter-railway operations to stations along the Dao-Qing, Longhai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Jinpu, Zhengtai, and Jiaoji Railways, adding fifteen stations, including Chuzhou on the Jinpu Railway, Zhenjiang and Suzhou on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, and Yanjia and Huayin stations on the Longhai Railway, issuing round-trip excursion tickets (first and second class), promoting inter-railway transportation of passenger luggage and parcels on various routes, establishing measures for excess weight charges for inter-railway parcels, increasing the speed of express trains on various routes, establishing procedures for lost receipts for collecting payments on behalf of customers, establishing procedures for the transport and compensation of damaged or missing inter-railway parcels, establishing a reduced price system for inter-railway perishable goods parcels, establishing operational regulations for through train services between Shanghai and Peiping, and establishing direct transport measures for inter-railway parcels on the Pinghan, Longhai, Jinpu, and Beijing-Shanghai Railways. In addition, routes close to waterways are negotiating with shipping companies to establish combined water-railway transportation, while routes close to highways are negotiating with highway authorities to establish combined highway-railway transportation, all of which are being promoted continuously. (B) Freight Inter-Railway Transportation: Regarding freight inter-railway transportation: (1) implementing a national responsible freight inter-railway transportation system, operating scheduled direct inter-railway freight trains and inter-regional direct trains; (2) establishing a price reduction system for inter-railway transportation over long distances; (3) implementing responsible water-railway freight inter-railway transportation. (C) Train Schedules: Establishing connecting schedules for national inter-railway lines. (D) Publicity Efforts: (1) publishing a national railway travel guide; (2) compiling a concise timetable and regulations summary for national inter-railway transportation; (3) compiling a collection of freight inter-railway tariff schedules for various routes; (4) compiling a collection of passenger inter-railway fare schedules for various routes; (5) revising national inter-railway regulations; (6) compiling a timetable, fare, and mileage chart for through train services between Shanghai and Peiping. (E) Business Performance: Previously, revenue from passenger, luggage, parcel, and miscellaneous inter-railway transportation reached only around 500,000 yuan per month at its peak. Freight inter-railway transportation generated just over 100,000 yuan per month between May and September of last year. Currently, based on revenue figures for May of this year, passenger inter-railway transportation generates approximately over 700,000 yuan per month, and freight inter-railway transportation generates approximately over 1.2 million yuan per month, totaling approximately 2 million yuan, both of which have broken previous records. Compared to the peak revenue of 1 million yuan per month in 1923, this represents an increase of approximately 1 million yuan. Moreover, since the resumption of freight inter-railway transportation waybills in November of last year, the number has increased from over 4,500 to over 18,000, an increase of approximately threefold. This is still considered the off-season. If this conference further promotes and improves the system, the increase in revenue will undoubtedly be rapid and substantial. Therefore, based on past performance, the present is the most prosperous period. However, looking to the future, this is only the initial recovery, or in other words, the beginning of a future golden age. Furthermore, the Ministry's goal in vigorously promoting inter-railway transportation is not merely to focus on the increase in revenue compared to the past, but to promote the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce in our country, as well as social prosperity. Given the vastness of our country's land and the richness of its production, if combined with convenient transportation, enabling it to compete with the world economy, it is predicted that the volume of goods to be exported each year should be ten or a hundred times the current export volume. The Ministry should do its utmost to plan and prepare to meet the opportunity. This also depends on the joint efforts of people across the country. In summary, the above-mentioned aspects of inter-railway transportation all represent the significant progress made in passenger and freight inter-railway transportation through the active reorganization and promotion efforts of this department over the past year. The establishment of responsible freight inter-railway transportation is an unprecedented initiative that will greatly benefit the future of inter-railway transportation and is a distinctive feature of this reorganization. Judging by the revenue figures, all show signs of rapid progress. However, this department is overwhelmed with work and understaffed. Entrusting such a large amount of work to a very small number of people has resulted in an inability to cope with the daily tasks, and accounting records are increasingly backlogged. While adding personnel is not permitted due to environmental constraints, we can only urge the existing staff to work hard to catch up. Despite the summer heat, they have not slacked off. It is regrettable and painful that Mr. Zhu, a section member borrowed from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, sacrificed his life as a result of this effort. As for the proposals for this Inter-Railway Transportation Conference, there are 230 in total, divided into four categories: (1) Passenger Inter-Railway Transportation; (2) Freight Inter-Railway Transportation; (3) Tariffs and Freight Classes; (4) Reorganization. There are also 90 proposals for the Accounting Conference, all of which relate to issues of promotion and improvement. I believe that everyone has already studied them thoroughly. I hope that you will discuss and resolve them promptly, so that the conference can close by the end of this month, allowing the proposals to be submitted to the Ministry early and implemented across the board before the peak season. This is my sincere hope.)</p>
<p>Address by the Minister of Railways: (Today marks the opening of the 17th National Inter-Railway Transportation Conference. Transportation experts from various railway lines across the country and representatives from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are gathered together to discuss ways to enhance the inter-railway transportation business of our nation. After this conference, I am confident that the national inter-railway transportation business will achieve significant development. I am extremely pleased. In recent times, the rapid economic development of various countries around the world has been due to their convenient transportation, which facilitates the smooth flow of goods. Observers often point to the stagnation of our country's industry and the backwardness of our production as the main causes of economic decline. However, in a country as vast as China, the inconvenience of transportation prevents the export of inland products and hinders the interflow of goods between provinces. As a result, we are forced to rely on foreign goods. Conversely, our country is unable to adequately supply the raw materials needed by foreigners. How can the national economy avoid stagnation? The solution lies in making efforts to boost production on the one hand and striving to develop transportation on the other. The inter-railway transportation business must be fully completed to achieve the utmost convenience and speed in transportation, which is also our unfulfilled duty. Looking back at our country's railway administration, since the establishment of the Republic of China, it has been disrupted by repeated wars, leading to irreparable damage. We can disregard what happened in the past. Since the end of the Shanghai War two years ago, the railways have suffered even more severe wounds, while the people's need for transportation to support economic development has become even more pressing. In addition to striving to restore passenger and parcel inter-railway transportation, the Ministry has observed that the malpractices in railway freight transportation are deeply rooted. Without active reform, it will be impossible to achieve the desired effect of circulating goods, promoting social prosperity, and developing the national and people's economy. Therefore, the Ministry has ordered all railway lines to implement responsible transportation. As the first step, responsible transportation by various railway lines has gradually shown results. As the second step, the Inter-Railway Transportation Conference last year decided to create a railway responsible freight inter-railway transportation system, followed by water-railway and railway-highway responsible freight inter-railway transportation systems. Since its implementation, remarkable results have been achieved. The revenue from inter-railway freight in May of this year increased to over 1.1 million yuan, a tenfold increase compared to the monthly revenue of just over 100,000 yuan from freight inter-railway transportation last year. I recall that at this time last year, the Ministry was in the initial stages of planning the implementation of responsible railway freight inter-railway transportation. However, at that time, various railway lines lacked locomotives, vehicles were damaged, and there was a lack of uniformity in vehicle technology, construction, and operation. Moreover, inter-railway transportation by various railway lines had been suspended for a long time, and the previous regulations for crossing tracks, calculating vehicle rental fees, and late fees were no longer applicable. Therefore, experts from various departments were assembled, and they devoted themselves to meticulous discussions over dozens of times. After detailed research by vehicle operations and accounting personnel from various railway lines, a concrete plan was finally drafted. However, in the initial stages of implementation, the Ministry and the leaders of various railway lines were constantly cautious and prudent, fearing that implementation would be difficult and problems would arise. Fortunately, over the past year, such results have been achieved, all thanks to the diligent efforts and dedication of everyone involved. This is what I, as Minister, am gratified about. However, the significance of inter-railway transportation lies in fully developing the cooperative transportation capabilities of railways, waterways, and highways to meet the needs of the people. Responsible freight inter-railway transportation is a large-scale undertaking. While the initial plan has been completed, the future prospects are even greater. In terms of technology, due to differences in construction and vehicle construction, various railway lines are still unable to smoothly cross tracks. Even considering the current situation of the Jinpu and Beijing-Shanghai Railways, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has only over 180 vehicles capable of crossing the Yangtze River via ferry, and the Jinpu Railway has only over 220 vehicles. This is insufficient to fully utilize the efficiency of the river ferry. Other railway lines have vehicles that are damaged and unusable, lack handbrakes for inter-railway transportation, or cannot be used for inter-railway transportation due to tonnage limitations. All of these urgently need to be reorganized and communicated. In terms of legal systems, the previously established interim measures were originally intended to facilitate the initial implementation of inter-railway transportation by various railway lines. However, some of the restrictions are too strict and often conflict with reality, while some clauses are incomplete and urgently need to be supplemented. For example, in the event of loss of inter-railway freight, various railway lines often push responsibility onto each other, making it impossible to quickly resolve compensation, which is especially detrimental to the future of responsible credit. Detailed and feasible measures should be properly formulated to facilitate easy judgment. In terms of personnel, according to the Ministry's investigation, employees of various railway lines either do not fully understand the various inter-railway regulations or fail to implement them effectively, often leading to errors. Efforts should be made to improve this situation. Even considering the equipment of tarpaulins, which are originally intended to cover freight, they are often used improperly. Due to a lack of inspection and repair, leaks and damage to passenger and freight often occur during transit. It cannot be said that personnel have done their part in these situations. In terms of equipment, the most important inter-railway stations on various railway lines are often incomplete. The handling of track is not swift, and the lack of tarpaulins makes it impossible to fully utilize guard vehicles. Moreover, the lack of warehouse and freight yard facilities at stations where various railway lines stockpile goods makes it impossible to store large quantities of goods, which poses a significant obstacle to encouraging production and developing the rural economy. Although the Ministry is planning construction, how should it be planned to facilitate these things? All of these issues require research and action. In summary, given the urgent need for national and economic development, the Ministry believes that the future operating policy of various railway lines must focus on vigorously promoting inter-railway transportation, coupled with close coordination with waterways and highways, to concentrate the nation's transportation resources and respond to the trend of global economic progress. In addition, I hope that you will pool your wisdom and devote yourselves to improving passenger inter-railway transportation facilities, improving passenger services, and improving and facilitating parcel inter-railway transportation. Take on the responsibility of joint cooperation and complete this transportation mission. This is my greatest hope. (20th)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Industrial Testing Institute Experiments with Leather Manufacturing Methods</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the establishment of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Construction's Industrial Testing Institute, the institute has achieved excellent results in various industrial experiments. As leather manufacturing is a crucial industry for society, it urgently needs experimentation. Therefore, the department has urged the institute to carry it out. The results of the experiment are recorded below: Leather manufacturing is the process of refining leather, and there are currently two methods: one is the tannin method, which is a long-established leather manufacturing method; the other is the chrome tanning method, which is a recent invention. Because the chrome tanning method produces many types of leather and has a wide range of applications, this method has progressed rapidly and is more important than the tannin method. However, there are also two types of chrome tanning: the two-bath method and the one-bath method. The two-bath method involves treating the leather separately with two different solutions: a chromic acid bath and a reducing bath. (1) Chromic Acid Solution: For every 100 catties of bare hide, use heavy potassium chromate and 50 to 80 kilograms of sulfuric acid, and half a catty to one catty of edible salt, and add water to make a thin solution. Place it in a pottery vat and immerse the hide. When the hide is immersed, it must be lifted and turned several times. After the tanning liquid has been immersed for a day and night, observe whether the tanning liquid has penetrated to the center of the hide. You only need to use a small knife to cut open the thicker part of the hide to see. If the inside of the hide is yellow, it is clear evidence that it has been completely penetrated. At this time, the hide can be taken out and placed on a wooden frame to drain the excess liquid, and covered with a straw mat to avoid the effects of light. (2) Reducing Bath: For every 100 catties of dehaired hide, use nine catties of sodium thiosulfate to make a saturated solution, and add it separately in five or six exchanges. The method involves adding a small amount of water to a pottery vat, adding part of the sodium thiosulfate, and putting the hide in it, constantly rubbing it. After a considerable amount of time, a yellow chromic liquid will ooze out. At this time, pour out the liquid and replace it with a small amount of fresh water, add part of the sulfuric acid, and rub the hide in the same way. When the liquid turns yellow, pour it out again, and then use part of the sodium thiosulfate, alternating operations. The hide will change from yellow to ochre, from ochre to brown, and from brown to blue. Each time it is replaced, it takes about fifteen minutes to half an hour to rub it. This is the manual manufacturing method. Now, the Department of Construction has ordered the Industrial Testing Institute to purchase a leather manufacturing machine, shaped like a large drum, which can tan more than ten hides in about a quarter of an hour each time. With the power of the machine's rotation, the hide easily absorbs the medicinal liquid, making manufacturing fast and the products excellent. It is not only convenient for tanning leather, but also for dyeing and oiling the leather. This is the convenience of using machine manufacturing. (September 20th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee Holds Supplementary Oath-Taking Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>Followed by a Plenary Committee Meeting</p>
<p>Several Important Cases Resolved</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The members of the Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee held an oath-taking ceremony a few days ago. However, due to the fact that the majority of the members were tied up with official duties or were unable to attend due to illness, only a small number of members took the oath. Recently, Committee members Ye Han and others were in the province on official business, so a supplementary oath-taking ceremony was held yesterday (the 22nd) morning. Attending were Committee members Han Guojun, Ye Chuqi, Leng Yuqiu, Luo Liangjian, Xiang Zhizhuang, Yu Jingtang, Ye Xiufeng, as well as representatives from the Provincial Party Headquarters, members of the Provincial Government, heads of various departments, and representatives from various agencies, totaling over a hundred people. Chen Guoqu served as the oath administrator. After the members took the oath as required, the oath administrator delivered a speech. Yu Xilai, a representative from the Provincial Party Headquarters, gave a speech, and Committee member Ye Chuqi gave a reply.

<h3>Jiaoji Railway Plans to Purchase Boshan Light Railway</h3>
<p>Ministry of Railways Dispatches Personnel for Fair Valuation</p>
<p>Provincial and Municipal Governments Assist in Facilitating the Deal</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Negotiations regarding the sale of the Boshan commercially-operated light railway to the Jiaoji Railway have been ongoing for a long time. The reason for the need to take it back is that most of the coal produced in the Boshan mines is transported from the mines to Boshan Station on the Jiaoji Line via this railway before being transferred to various locations. However, the railway's fares are high and its transportation capacity is low. If the Jiaoji Railway does not take it back and find ways to reduce prices and increase transportation capacity, the Japanese Chehe Coal Mining Company will build its own elevated railway, resulting in a significant loss of interests. The commercial party initially asked for 1.4 million yuan, while the Jiaoji Railway estimated the price at 800,000 yuan, a difference of 600,000 yuan, which is a very large disparity. The Jiaoji Railway Bureau reported this to the Ministry of Railways and requested that personnel be dispatched for a fair valuation. Xia Guangyu, a consultant dispatched by the Ministry, passed through Jinan on his way to Qingdao to attend the railway inter-railway transportation conference and will conduct an assessment soon. Ge Guangting, the chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, also requested that Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie and Zhang Honglie, the director of the Construction Department of this province, facilitate the matter. After receiving Ge's telegram, Zhang Honglie took the Jiaoji train to Qingdao last night (the 20th) at 10:00 PM. According to reports, the commercial party of the Boshan Light Railway is asking for 1.4 million yuan, including newly purchased materials. There is hope for a deal in the future. The reason for my trip to Qingdao is to find an opportunity to facilitate it with Mayor Shen. Because the railway has a lot of debt, it has long been managed by the creditor group. The creditor group has scheduled a meeting in Jinan on October 1st to discuss everything because the sale of the railway is imminent. In addition, the railway inter-railway transportation conference is being held in Qingdao, and railway-highway inter-railway transportation is also on the agenda. The Automobile Road Administration Bureau of this province has dispatched Yuan Tieyan, the chief of the business section, to attend the conference. In principle, he agrees with railway-highway inter-railway transportation. However, this province does not have many dedicated automobile roads, and automobiles are at risk of being suspended in the event of rain, which will affect the credibility of inter-railway transportation. Therefore, it is still under careful consideration. I will not stay in Qingdao for long and will return to Jinan in two or three days, etc. (21st)</p>

<h3>District Chief's Home Robbed at Night</h3>
<p>Li Zufu, the chief of the first district of this county, has lived in Silu Lane in this city for generations. The Li family is wealthy. Since Li assumed the post of district chief, he has been very busy serving the local community. Recently, he was commissioned to go out on official business. Unexpectedly, last night (the 21st) at about 3:00 AM, several robbers suddenly broke in over the wall, coerced the district chief's family, and robbed a leather suitcase containing more than seventy yuan in cash. Then they broke into chests and wardrobes. This was heard by Lu Jingzi, who was renting a place there, and he climbed onto the roof and called for help. Although the robbers were carrying pistols and daggers, they did not dare to stay. Some of them escaped along the original path. Later, the incident was reported to the local police station, which dispatched police to investigate, but no one was arrested. However, the people of Songjiang believe that Silu Lane is a place with strict security in the city. The fact that a robbery occurred has made residents living in quiet places feel insecure. Therefore, the family of District Chief Li has reported the incident to the county government, requesting that an investigation be launched to capture the stolen goods and robbers to warn against illegal activities.</p>

<h3>Land Surveyors' Strike</h3>
<p>The monthly wages of the land surveyors stationed in the county by the Provincial Land Bureau's Land Survey Team are less than ten yuan for the lower-paid workers and only thirteen or fourteen yuan for the higher-paid workers. However, the wages for July have not yet been paid. Unable to maintain their livelihoods, they requested a loan from the team, but were rejected. Therefore, they secretly gathered over a hundred people and went on strike on the 19th, gathering at the public sports field. They sent representatives to the team headquarters to meet with the team leader, Chi Yun, demanding that the wages be paid in full. At the same time, they distributed leaflets containing statements accusing Team Leader Chi of employing private individuals, protecting subordinates, molesting women, and smoking opium. Team Leader Chi, fearing that there might be a hidden background, reported the incident to the county Public Security Bureau, which dispatched six police officers to the scene. The atmosphere was tense for a while. After Team Leader Chi made an explanation and promised that the wages for July would be paid immediately, the surveyors obeyed the instructions and dispersed.</p>

<h3>Zhenyi and Hengfeng Silk Factories Suspend Operations</h3>
<p>In recent years, the silk market has been sluggish, with prices plummeting. Overseas sales have stalled, and they are under pressure from foreign silk, making it even more difficult to gain a foothold. Currently, user silk in the market is only selling for over 400 yuan. However, the cost of dry cocoons this season is 120 to 130 yuan, so selling the silk for only 410 yuan results in a significant loss. At present, dry cocoons are only selling for 95 yuan, and no one is asking about them. If they are reeled into silk and sold, there is no profit to be made. Therefore, the Zhenyi and Hengfeng factories outside the South Gate have already suspended operations yesterday, waiting for the silk market to turn around before resuming reeling. The staff were paid half a month's salary and dismissed, while the female workers had half a month's salary saved in the factory, to be returned when operations resume. This year's autumn silkworm harvest has been poor, with limited production. The price of cocoons is 20 yuan per dan, plus 10 yuan for expenses and 6 yuan for improvement fees, totaling 36 yuan per dan of fresh cocoons. Three dan of fresh cocoons are dried into one dan of dry cocoons, and then 550 catties of dry cocoons are reeled into one dan of silk, for a total cost of 594 yuan. However, the best silk market only sells for over 420 yuan, resulting in a net loss of over 170 yuan. Because of this, how can silk factories survive? I cannot help but feel sad about the future of our country's silk cocoons.</p>
<h3>Unresolved Dispute Over Toll Fees</h3>
<p>Small passenger cars operating on the Xicheng Road have gone on strike in protest against the Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company's excessive collection of toll fees. Representatives were sent to the provincial government to petition, as previously reported. It has now been learned that Shen Qi, the director of the Provincial Highway Bureau, has dispatched Yao Wenji, the chief of the bureau's business section, to Wuxi to handle the matter. Mr. Yao arrived in Wuxi yesterday morning and is staying at Room 22 of the Wuxi Hotel. In the afternoon, he visited Zhang Fulin, the director of the local construction bureau, and convened a meeting with Yang Zhaoqing, the representative of the Passenger Car Trade Association, at the bureau to discuss the matter. Director Yao stated that, according to regulations, the minimum toll fee must be 50 cents. Therefore, even though the Wuxi to Yanqiao section is only 12 kilometers, a fee of 50 cents must be charged. For the Qingyang, Nanzha, and Jiangyin sections, the fees will be 60 cents, 80 cents, and one yuan respectively, as a standard for resolving the dispute. Regarding the restriction on passenger capacity for both large and small cars, and the publication of donation amounts, these matters will be handled in accordance with the law. However, the passenger car operators requested that the toll fee for Yanqiao be calculated based on the number of kilometers. Mr. Yao stated that this matter required the consent of the Xicheng Company. Later, Mr. Yao invited Sun Chenchu, the manager of the Xicheng Company, to his hotel to discuss the matter, but Mr. Sun indicated that he could not accept a reduction in the toll fee for Yanqiao, resulting in no resolution. Mr. Yao is scheduled to return to the provincial capital today and will accompany Director Shen Qi of the Highway Bureau to Wuxi to mediate.</p>

<h3>Transportation Ministry Inspects the Ring Road</h3>
<p>The Jiangchang Road Ring Road was the subject of a dispute due to the demolition of the city wall and houses. The county government submitted a report to the Construction Department, which approved a compromise solution. Construction has now commenced. The Executive Yuan, based on a report from the provincial government regarding the city wall demolition issue, which is related to national defense, ordered the Military Affairs Ministry to investigate. The Military Affairs Ministry instructed Commander Xie of the Fortress to send Li Min, along with Cui Hualiang, the section chief of the county government's third section, to conduct an on-site inspection on the 20th. Mr. Li stated that if the demolition of the barbican had no impact on national defense, he would report to Commander Xie and request instructions from the Military Affairs Ministry.</p>

<h3>Large Quantity of Opium Seized</h3>
<p>Wu Shude, a Guangdong native in Sanyang Town, Fourth District, established an organization to sell opium, distributing it to various villages and profiting greatly. In May of this year, he was detained by the Nantong District Commissioner's Office on suspicion of trafficking in narcotics. Yesterday morning, the County Public Security Bureau learned that Wu had a large quantity of opium hidden in his home. Inspector Ding was immediately dispatched with police officers to conduct a search, seizing 50 packs of opium.

The bandits ransacked the house, searching at will for over an hour before leaving. Afterwards, it was discovered that approximately 500 yuan worth of cash, jewelry, and clothing had been lost. On the same night, the home of Zhang Xiude in the same township was also robbed by more than ten bandits, resulting in a loss of over 50 yuan in cash and foreign currency. Zhang's wife, Chen, was shot in the left leg while fleeing and calling for help. The victims reported the incidents to the county government yesterday, requesting an investigation.</p>

<h3>The Collapse of the Rural Economy</h3>
<p>According to reports from various districts in Tongyi, this year's autumn harvest is less than 40% of normal. The local area has not recovered since the great flood of 1931, and the failure of homespun cloth has brought the farmers' only side business to a standstill. Furthermore, the shipment of chickens, ducks, and fresh pigs to the Jiangnan region has also declined, resulting in a market surplus and a drastic fall in prices. As a result, various industries have declined, and tax revenues have fallen sharply. Primary school teachers have been owed salaries for six months, and the county's finances are in dire straits, relying on borrowing to maintain the status quo.</p>

<h3>New Stamp Tax Tickets Have Been Printed</h3>
<p>Printed by the Beijing Printing Bureau</p>
<p>Directly Issued to Post Offices in Various Places</p>
<p>Issued Starting November 1st</p>
<p>According to World News Agency, after the Ministry of Finance formulated the new stamp tax ticket with the Pagoda brand design, it notified the stamp tax collection agencies in various places to terminate all old stamps by the end of October of this year and officially issue new stamps on November 1st. The new stamps will be sold by post offices throughout the country. Although chambers of commerce in various places have submitted requests to exchange old stamps for new ones, according to Minister Kong's recent statement to reporters, the Ministry of Finance seems unlikely to approve this. A World News Agency reporter interviewed a responsible person at the Ministry of Finance yesterday to inquire about the Ministry of Finance's views on the merchants' request and whether the new stamps would be issued as scheduled. The following detailed answer was received:</p>
<p>It is Difficult to Approve the Exchange of Old Stamps It is said that stamp tax tickets are levied on certificates and have a certain period of validity. The stamp tax collection method stipulated by the Ministry has always been to affix stamps in practice. In recent years, many merchants have followed the rules and affixed stamps, while others have delayed or evaded taxes. Such opportunism has greatly affected national tax revenue. Therefore, new stamps are being issued to eliminate past malpractices. Recently, chambers of commerce in various places have requested the Ministry to exchange old stamp tax tickets for new ones or extend the period of use. After the resolution of the National Financial Conference, the Ministry of Finance has extended the issuance date to November 1st, which is already very considerate of the merchants. Therefore, this request is difficult to approve based on the facts.</p>
<p>New Stamps Have Been Printed and Will Be Issued as Scheduled As for the new Pagoda brand stamp tax tickets, they are printed by the Ministry's Beijing Printing Bureau. The total number of the first batch is 5 million yuan, and they have been classified and printed. The face value of the tickets is the same as the old stamps, divided into seven types: one cent, two cents, five cents, one dime, two dimes, five dimes, and one yuan. The issuance is scheduled for November 1st. In order to eliminate malpractices in the future, it has been decided that post offices in various places will sell them. In order to save procedures during issuance, they will no longer be transported to the Ministry of Finance, but will be directly sent from Beijing to post offices in various places. This matter has been discussed with the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>Strict Inspection and Punishment in Accordance with the Law The methods for inspecting the omission of stamp tax and the matters of punishment were originally handled by the case review committees for violations of stamp tax regulations in various places. In recent years, due to the review situation, there have been no significant results. In order to thoroughly reform, after the issuance of new stamps, the Ministry will directly send personnel to handle inspection work. If violations are discovered, they will be sent to the local court for strict handling. Furthermore, 30% of these stamps are allocated to local governments, so local governments can also conduct strict inspections to facilitate promotion.</p>
<h3>Zhao Bingren Talks About the Northwest Mobile National Exhibition</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou is the Best for Business</p>
<p>Xi'an Holds the Most Promise for the Future</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that the Northwest Mobile National Products Exhibition Group, sponsored by the Shanghai Chinese National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, and jointly organized by more than twenty companies including Chang Yuan National Products Factory, Mei Ya, and San You, departed in May for Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and other places to hold exhibitions and conduct on-site inspections of local industrial and commercial conditions. After a four-month journey, they have now returned to Shanghai. Yesterday, a reporter had the opportunity to interview Zhao Bingren, the director of the group, who stated that under the dual mission of developing the Northwest and promoting national products, the Chinese National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, at the invitation of the governments of Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces, initiated and organized the Northwest Mobile Exhibition Group. Initially, due to the length of the trip, the large expenses, and the difficult circumstances, the factories adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Later, the Association proceeded with the utmost determination and perseverance, which greatly moved the factories, and they registered to join one after another. However, the organization of this exhibition group was aimed at achieving the highest level of rigor and excellence, so only twenty units were stipulated (one factory per unit), preferring quality over quantity, and the review was extremely strict. As a result, twenty factories, including Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory, China Chemical Industry Corporation, China Enamel Factory, Wuhe Weaving Factory, and San You Industrial Company, were formally approved as members. The Association appointed members to serve as members of the group affairs committee, and the group affairs committee appointed the director of group affairs to lead more than eighty staff members dispatched by the twenty factory units. They set off for Henan on May 20th, first arriving in Kaifeng, where they held an exhibition for two weeks at the National Products Market, then proceeded to Zhengzhou, where they held an exhibition for one week at the Zheng County Chamber of Commerce, then visited Luoyang, where they held an exhibition for one week at the County Chamber of Commerce, and then went to Xi'an in Shaanxi, where they held an exhibition for two weeks at the Provincial People's Education Center. After the Xi'an exhibition concluded, they planned to replenish their goods, pack their equipment, hire vehicles, and go to Lanzhou in Gansu to complete the final exhibition of the group. Unexpectedly, continuous rain in the Shaanxi-Gansu area caused mountain floods to erupt, and the already difficult Xilan Road was washed away by the water, and the road surface and bridges were destroyed. Vehicle merchants hesitated, and traffic was completely cut off. At that time, the group still wanted to find ways to make the trip possible, but after waiting for more than twenty days, the road remained damaged and the vehicles remained stopped, and everything remained the same. They had no choice but to abandon the trip to Lanzhou and pack up and return east. However, even based on the four locations of Bian, Zheng, Luo, and Xi that the group experienced, the length of the trip was enough to break the record of previous national product mobile exhibitions. Moreover, the above-mentioned locations had little knowledge and distribution of national products. This time, the group did not avoid hardship, did not decline sacrifice, and transported famous factory national products to the west for exhibition. The welcome and assistance from the provincial governments goes without saying, while the enthusiasm of other organizations and the enthusiastic visits of local people all prove the urgent need for national products in the Northwest and the far-reaching influence of holding a Northwest mobile exhibition. Although the participating factories all suffered losses due to the large expenses of this trip, in reality, this trip has opened the way for national products to go to the Northwest and has established a good foundation for people in the Northwest to love and use national products, which can be said to be a huge and substantial gain. Weighing the gains and losses, the factories actually benefited. The commercial conditions in Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Xi'an were previously better in Zhengzhou, but in the near future, Xi'an will be the most promising. Shaanxi Province previously suffered from repeated natural and man-made disasters, and the people's livelihoods were in dire straits. Purchasing power was greatly reduced, and there was almost no commerce to speak of for a time. In the past two or three years, Yang and Shao divided the military and political affairs, and the bandits were cleared and the land was pacified, and all policies were gradually implemented. The National Economic Commission also provided manpower and financial resources to assist Shaanxi Province in various important construction projects that benefited the people. Agricultural crops such as cotton and wheat have had bumper harvests for many years, and this year's harvest is particularly good. Various banks in Shanghai have provided economic relief and assistance to farmers, and have spared no effort to assist rural development. Barren land has been replanted, rural areas have been restored, and the social economy has indeed undergone the greatest transformation. Therefore, commercial conditions have naturally gradually become prosperous and good. Unfortunately, the local area is flooded with foreign goods, and the major merchants are all distributors of foreign goods. The Chinese and foreign staff sent by foreign firms in Shanghai and Tianjin to investigate and promote sales are constantly traveling, paying close attention. Our national product industry previously voluntarily gave up the Northwest market and paid no attention to it, causing foreign goods to enter before us and occupy a superior position. It is painful to talk about. This time, the Association organized the Northwest mobile exhibition with the greatest determination, which is also to give the factories an opportunity to witness this situation, so that they can know to work hard. Now that the mobile exhibition group has ended, it is hoped that the factories will use the observations gained from this trip as a reference, actively produce products suitable for the needs of the Northwest, and go to the Northwest to operate and promote sales, so that foreign goods will not permanently occupy the market, so as to live up to the expectations of the people of the Northwest and also to protect the vitality of the country. The Association's responsibility lies in this, and it will naturally supervise and facilitate the promotion of sales for the factories at any time.</p>

<h3>Baohua Still Not Out of Danger</h3>
<p>Passengers Have Already Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>Company Sends Ships and Tugboats</p>
<p>The Peace Shipping Company's Baohua Wheel ran aground on the east beach of Miaogang on the evening of the 20th. The location is called Xishatou. It was originally planned to try to get out of danger during the high tide at around 1:00 AM yesterday, but the ship owner used full speed to sail, but it had no effect. They had no choice but to send someone to Haikou Power Generation to seek help from the Shanghai Bureau.</p>
<p>Passengers Arrive in Shanghai The ship had more than 700 passengers from Chongsha and other ports to Shanghai. They were stranded for a day and a night, and the food on board was limited and about to run out. All the passengers on board asked the ship owner to transfer them to Shanghai. The Baofeng Wheel happened to pass by the day before, and the Baohua ship owner asked it to transfer the passengers. Baofeng agreed to carry 400 people. Later, the Guangxiang Wheel also arrived and also complied with Baohua's request, carrying more than 300 people to Shanghai. The two ships arrived one after another at 6:00 AM and 7:00 AM yesterday and landed in the South City.</p>
<p>The Ship is Still Aground According to people from the Baofeng Wheel, the Baohua Wheel has been trapped in the sand for two days and two nights, and it may take another day or two to get out of danger. The cargo on board is still in the cabin, and some of the fresh goods will be damaged after being delayed for a long time. Many cargo owners came to the company yesterday to inquire.</p>
<p>Chu Yuan Goes to Rescue After the company received the ship owner's distress call, it agreed to send the Chu Yuan tugboat from Dada Company to Miaogang at 0:45 AM yesterday to try to tow and rescue the ship. The company claimed that after Chu Yuan arrives, it is expected to be able to pull it out and return to Shanghai during high tide.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Watered and Adulterated Cotton: Cotton Industry Control Council Announces Progress</h3>
<p>Crackdown Offices in All Provinces Will Be Fully Established This Month</p>
<p>The Economic Commission's Allocation of Funds is Not Accurate</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the National Government promulgated the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Cracking Down on Watered and Adulterated Cotton on the 20th and scheduled to implement them on November 1st. The Cotton Industry Control Council, due to the many inaccuracies in the reports in the newspapers in recent days, specially issued a written statement to the New Voice News Agency yesterday as follows: Cotton production in our country has always been a major agricultural product, but before the development of the textile industry, in addition to exports, it was mostly used for hand-woven textiles and stuffing quilts. There were very few handling procedures, so there were not many people who watered and adulterated it. When the European War broke out, the domestic textile industry progressed and cotton production increased, and the incidents of fraud increased day by day, which had a great impact on foreign trade and textile projects, making the textile industry feel that buying domestic cotton was not as good as foreign cotton. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce saw that</p>
<p>Cotton Fraud and Production Area Inspection, so it first established commodity inspection bureaus in Shanghai, Hankou, Qingdao, Tianjin, and other ports to conduct preliminary inspections of cotton to maintain the reputation of Chinese cotton in foreign trade. All exported cotton must have an inspection certificate before it can be reported for export. There has been considerable success in exported cotton. The number of domestic spindles has increased year by year, sales have increased, and exports have naturally decreased. Therefore, cracking down on cotton fraud is more important in the inland than in exports. This council was established in October of last year, and for the issue of raw cotton, it has determined the principle of giving equal importance to improvement and promotion, and especially paying attention to the areas suitable for American species cultivation in the Northwest, promoting pure American cotton to alleviate the urgent need for long-staple cotton in the country. In addition, cotton producing provinces and regions have also established cotton production improvement institutes one after another, so this year's cotton production in various provinces, except for those affected by disasters, has made considerable progress in terms of output and quality, but if not</p>
<p>Intensify the crackdown on fraud, this considerable progress will inevitably be destroyed by fraud. Therefore, when carrying out the improvement of cotton production, it is urgent to supplement it with the work of cracking down on fraud. Therefore, after implementing the improvement of cotton production, the council negotiated with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to intensify the method of cracking down on fraud. After many discussions, the Provisional Regulations on Cracking Down on Watered and Adulterated Cotton were formulated and sent by the National Economic Commission to the Executive Yuan, the Central Political Conference, and the Legislative Yuan for review and approval, and were promulgated by the National Government on July 10. After the promulgation of these regulations, the council negotiated with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to formulate detailed rules for the implementation of the regulations, which were also reviewed and approved by the Executive Yuan and promulgated by the National Government on the 20th of this month. On the one hand, it immediately started to prepare to contact and establish the central and provincial cotton watered and adulterated cotton crackdown offices. Before the director and deputy director of the central cotton watered and adulterated cotton crackdown office were appointed by the National Economic Commission, Ye Yuanding, the technician of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the technical specialist of this council,</p>
<p>Responsible for Preparation The cotton crackdown offices in various provinces, Henan has already been established, and other provinces have also sent people to contact and negotiate separately, and it is expected that they will all be established one after another within this month. As for the funding for the central crackdown office, it will be requested to be borne by the central government. The funding for the crackdown offices in various provinces will be based on the principle that each province will be responsible for itself. When there is insufficient funding, it will be requested from the central government for subsidies. In this era when the central and provincial government expenses are extremely difficult, although things have to be carried out actively, expenses should be saved as much as possible. Yesterday's report in the Shen Shi News Agency said that "(the Economic Commission has allocated one million yuan as funding)" and "(the Economic Commission has specially allocated 600,000 yuan as start-up expenses) " are completely untrue. This should be solemnly declared. In short, eradicating watered and adulterated cotton is a necessary way to improve cotton production in our country. It is hoped that yarn merchants and cotton merchants across the country will cooperate to fundamentally eradicate the long-standing malpractices within two years, then the government's measures today will not be in vain.</p>

It is now known that the company received the Shanghai Social Bureau's Letter No. 7785 yesterday, forwarding the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Commercial Letter No. 28275, which stated, "The registration application submitted by the company has been examined and found to be in compliance and should be approved. An approved license is hereby issued, which you should immediately forward to the applicant." Since the company has been approved for registration, it plans to open for business on a scheduled date. However, the original address at 500 Henan Road is not sufficient, and it is now scheduled to move to the new building at 261 Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road on October 1st to start work. After the company is established, according to the original plan, it will set up sales networks in various provinces in order to achieve the purpose of supporting production. In addition, it also plans to actively promote the development of overseas trade markets in order to save the country through production.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Provincial National Exhibition Solicits Products from Shanghai Manufacturers</h3>
<p>The National Products Movement Newspaper Office on Rere Road in this city has received a letter from the Yunnan Provincial National Products Promotion Committee, forwarded by Zhu Gengtao, General Manager of Shifeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, soliciting Shanghai national product manufacturers to send samples and trademark designs of their products to the province for display and exhibition, and has scheduled the opening of the National Products Exhibition on November 12th, hoping to promote the solicitation of products, etc. The letter and the notice to manufacturers soliciting products are recorded below,</p>
<p>Letter Soliciting Products To Whom It May Concern, We have received a letter from Ma Xiaochun, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial National Products Promotion Committee, stating that "Our province is located on the border, which leads to the fact that the people of Yunnan Province cannot purchase national products at will. As a result, foreign goods are dumped and rights and interests are leaked, which is immeasurable. If we do not take urgent action to save the situation, the future of national products will be even more bleak. Our association was established to work hard on publicity and promotion. We have scheduled the Yunnan Provincial National Products Exhibition to be held on November 12th. Your factory is located in Shanghai, please solicit samples or trademarks from manufacturers in the vicinity and send them to our association in Yunnan for display, or your factory can collect them and transfer them to Yunnan, which is also welcome. The matter concerns the promotion of national products, to meet the needs and recognition of the people of Yunnan Province, and to benefit the sale of national products. We hope that you will promptly notify the factories to handle it, such as displaying samples after the exhibition, urge celebrities to review and award prizes to show encouragement, etc." According to this, we believe that promoting national products is the foundation of saving the country. Your agency is one of the propaganda agencies of the National Products Movement. This time, the Yunnan Provincial National Exhibition solicited products and other items, please quickly publicize them to the factories so that they can pay attention to sending samples for display, and maintain the spirit of promoting national products,</p>
<h3>German Merchants in Shanghai Flew Over the City in a Giant Airplane Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Flight Took Place From 3 PM to 6 PM</p>
<p>According to the Daily News Agency, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's giant aircraft, which flew from Shanghai to Jiujiang to welcome Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei and Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke back to Beijing, and then flew from Beijing to Shanghai with President Wang on board, stopped at the Hongqiao Airport. A reporter from the Daily News Agency learned from the company yesterday that yesterday afternoon, many German merchants in Shanghai, because of their admiration for the aircraft's size, requested a trial ride to tour the city. The company complied with the German merchants' request, so yesterday afternoon, starting at 3 PM, Director Geblenz flew the plane for three hours, and landed at around 6 PM. The German merchants all returned with joy.</p>
<p>To</p>
<p>Letter to Manufacturers To Whom It May Concern, (Omitted above) Awakening Yunnan is the southern border of China, located in the center of China and foreign countries, with a large population and abundant production. To the east is Sichuan, facing Vietnam, Luo and the French territories. To the west are Guizhou and Guangxi, and to the north are Myanmar and the British territories. If national products are sold smoothly in Yunnan, then they can be further developed and national products can easily reach foreign markets. It is hoped that national product manufacturers will have a broad vision and a spirit of sacrifice in promotion, and use product samples as a pioneer for publicity, and plan for future development. Therefore, this time the province displays the Shanghai national products exhibition, and the responsibility of advocating it, its main driving force, depends entirely on the efforts of the manufacturers themselves. Therefore, those who want to develop national products in foreign markets, its important promotion key, must first conduct sales in remote provinces and then prosper to foreign countries. It is hoped that all manufacturers will pay attention to it, and also hope to send samples quickly to promote the country's destiny. Respectfully to all national product manufacturers, Zheng Dongshan, Director of the Shanghai National Products Movement Newspaper.</p>

<h3>Report on Disaster Investigation by the Special Commissioner of the World Red Swastika Society</h3>
<p>The Truth About the Disasters in Liyang and Jiangpu</p>
<p>The China General Association of the World Red Swastika Society, in view of the severe drought disasters in various parts of Southeast China, specifically scheduled a disaster relief conference to be held in Beijing on September 28, and first elected Special Disaster Relief Commissioner Li Tianzhen, the president of the association, to go south to investigate the disaster situation. Commissioner Li has now completed the investigation of the disaster situation in Liyang and Jiangpu counties and has arrived in Shanghai. The following is an excerpt from Commissioner Li's report: (I, Tianzhen, was dispatched by the General Association on the 8th of this month to go to Jiangpu, Liyang, Lishui, Jiangdu, Changzhou, and other counties to distribute drought relief funds. I followed the order and packed my bags and went south on the 10th, carefully visiting and investigating along the way. After arriving in Beijing, I met with the people from the Southeast Main Association, who all agreed that Liyang and Jiangpu counties were the most severely affected, so I hurriedly set off the next day, first going to Liyang from Beijing. After passing through Jurong, I saw that the paddy fields and seedlings were withered and full of eyes. Even if they were slightly moistened by autumn rain, the seedlings would recover, but they would all be showy but not fruitful. The disaster victims, strong men, supporting the old and carrying the young, fled to other places to seek food, filling the roads and paths, the misery of which was heartbreaking. After traveling for about an hour, I arrived at the boundary of the fourth and fifth districts of Liyang County. The withering of the crops there was even more severe than in Jurong. There were many unplanted white fields. The mulberry trees along the fields were all withered by the scorching sun. I arrived at Liyang County at 4:30 PM. That day, I contacted County Magistrate Chen and asked about the extent of the disaster. According to him, Liyang County is divided into six districts, and there are a total of more than 132 acres of mountain and paddy fields. Since the beginning of summer this year, from May to the end of July, there was no rain for more than ninety days. Not only were the mountain fields severely affected, but the paddy fields were also unable to be irrigated due to the drying up of rivers, resulting in no hope of harvest. The number of people waiting for relief is countless, etc. I immediately asked for a district map of the county and began to inspect the area that day. Liyang has always been known as a wealthy area. The main local products are silk and rice. This year's drought is the worst seen in nearly a hundred years. Not only is there no harvest of rice, but the silkworms have also suffered a serious blow. The reports of entire families taking medicine and families hanging themselves are indeed facts. The selling of wives and children is even more common. After inspecting the second, third, fourth, and fifth districts, the terrain is higher, and all rivers rely on mountain water. There has been no rain this summer, and the river source has been cut off. All public and private ponds used for irrigating fields in peacetime have dried up. Not only is there no way to irrigate, but there is also no way to obtain drinking water. Whether the seedlings have sprouted or not, they have all become weeds. Farmers have already started digging up grass roots to fill their hungry stomachs. The misery is unbearable to witness. The disaster in the first and sixth districts is roughly the same. However, there are large rivers in these areas, and inland river steamers travel back and forth between them without any obstacles in peacetime. In this severe drought, the riverbeds have cracked, and all ships are trapped at the bottom of the river. People dig earth wells to provide drinking water. The extent of the disaster is already obvious. This is the situation of the disaster in Liyang. As for Jiangpu County, the whole county is divided into five districts, with more than 300,000 acres of farmland, of which mountain fields account for eight-tenths and paddy fields account for two-tenths. It is known as a barren and poor hometown. Even in a year of good harvest, there is still concern about not being able to make ends meet. This year, there has been little rainfall in the spring, and there has been no rain at all in the summer. The fields are cracked and red everywhere. The rice crops have all withered and died, and the beans and millet have been eaten by insects. In this unusual drought, the suffering is even deeper. Although the paddy fields along the river have had a slight harvest, it is of no help. I have witnessed the withered crops in the county that can be burned by fire, thousands of families crying, and thousands of households without smoke. If we do not urgently prepare relief, the people will soon suffer from both hunger and cold, and there will be no survivors. However, the amount of money I brought this time is very small. Even based on the two counties I have investigated so far, at least a few figures, it is impossible to start without raising 30,000 yuan. Lishui, Jiangdu, Jurong, Yixing, Wujin, and other counties, although they are partially affected, should also be relieved accordingly. But the disaster area is vast and the number of disaster victims is large. It is also impossible to relieve the suffering without tens of thousands of yuan. I, Tianzhen, was ordered to go south, bearing this heavy responsibility, and I am deeply terrified. I pace around the room, hesitating and unable to decide. I humbly ask the various associations to generously show their great compassion and work together. I especially hope that kind-hearted gentlemen at home and abroad will have compassion for the survivors and quickly provide relief. The merit will be immeasurable.</p>
<h3>China and Foreign Charity and Disaster Relief Association Holds Cooperation Business Discussion Meeting</h3>
<p>The China and Foreign Charity and Disaster Relief Association has been promoting rural cooperative societies for more than ten years and has achieved considerable results. After the Yangtze River flood in 1931, the National Government Flood Relief Commission entrusted the association with the task of handling agricultural relief, and since then it has made every effort to promote it to various provinces. In order to discuss and improve cooperative businesses in various places, the association has scheduled a discussion meeting to be held in Beijing for three days starting on the 21st. In addition to Zhang Yuanshan, General Secretary of the Hebei Provincial General Association, Assistant Deputy Secretary Xu Fuzhi, and Yu Yongzi, Director of the Agricultural and Benefit Division, Yang Xingcun, Secretary of the Anhui Branch, Hu Weilian, Lender, Wei Jingchu, Secretary of the Jiangxi Branch, Hu Bixiang, Secretary of the Hubei Branch, Gao Naiming, Agricultural and Benefit Secretary, Xie Ganqing, Secretary of the Hunan Branch, Li Runzhi, Secretary of the Shaanxi Branch, and others have all arrived in Beijing successively. Li Guangcheng, Zhu Youshan, Wang Siqi, and others will also be present at the meeting. In the future, the association's cooperative business will surely make greater progress.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Health and Public Safety Bureaus Draft Improved Measures for Inspecting Medicines</h3>
<p>Inspectors Have the Right to Detain</p>
<p>Guarantors Must Bear Penalties on Behalf of Those Guaranteed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Health and Public Safety Bureaus sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stating: "In accordance with Instruction No. 9560 from the Municipal Government, regarding the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's submission of a request from the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association to change the method of inspecting Western medicines carried by travelers, in order to alleviate commercial difficulties, we were instructed to consult on improved measures. Having received this, our bureaus have jointly drafted measures and submitted them for review. We have now received instructions from the Municipal Government stating: 'The submitted documents have been reviewed. The proposed inspection measures are generally appropriate and should be implemented accordingly. However, when inspecting suspicious medicines, the suspected offenders should be temporarily released on bail with a reliable guarantor during the drug testing period and should not be detained for an extended period on the pretext of investigation to avoid harming the innocent. You are to comply with this order.' We are now enclosing a copy of the improved measures for inspecting medicines and the related forms for your reference and dissemination." The enclosed improved measures for inspecting medicines are as follows: 1. When transporting medicines out of the country, all merchants should carry invoices for inspection and provide a list (attached form) detailing the Chinese and Western names, weight, nature, place of purchase, destination, and selling stores of the medicines being transported. This list should be attached to the medicines to facilitate inspection by personnel at stations and wharves. If inspectors find any discrepancies or have doubts about the quality, they may detain the medicines or open them for inspection. 2. If inspectors find any suspicious medicines, they should immediately hand over the medicines and the carrier to the Public Safety Bureau for investigation. The Public Safety Bureau may send the medicines to the Hygiene Testing Institute for rapid testing. During the testing period, all suspected offenders may be temporarily released on bail with a reliable guarantor. If the testing results show that the carrier has committed a criminal offense, the guarantor must bear full responsibility for delivering the offender. Otherwise, the guarantor will bear the penalties that the guaranteed party would have received.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Requests the Abolition of Salted Meat and Ham Inspection</h3>
<p>The Salted Meat and Ham Industries Association of Shanghai, considering that the current inspection of salted meat and ham in Shanghai hinders the industry's business, has repeatedly petitioned the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to forward their request to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Municipal Government, and other authorities, seeking its abolition. A year has passed, and over ten petitions have been submitted. Last August, Wang Yansong, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, led representatives from both industries to Beijing to petition, but the authorities have not yet issued an order for abolition. The members of both associations are deeply concerned. Yesterday, they once again petitioned the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to forward their request to the relevant authorities, urging them to issue an order for abolition as soon as possible. It is reported that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has already submitted the case to the Executive Yuan and the Municipal Government for prompt review.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Dispute over Demolition of Houses in Leyi Lane</h3>
<p>French Police Notify Tenants to Move Out</p>
<p>Tenants Urgently Join Association to Counter</p>
<p>The owner of the houses in Leyi Lane, An Najin Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, Jiang Hanqi, commissioned the Tick Bell Property Department to notify tenants in June of this year that the houses would be demolished and rebuilt due to unsuccessful rent increases, ordering them to move out by the end of September. The tenants believe that the houses are still relatively new, in good condition, and sturdy, and that the owner had initially agreed to postpone the reconstruction. Therefore, they unanimously opposed the demolition and organized the Leyi Lane Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation to negotiate reasonably. They also hired two major lawyers, Wu Kaisheng and Zhu Dianqing, to provide legal protection and submitted a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government for relief. It is now known that the rental agent, Tick Bell Property Department, announced its withdrawal to avoid unreasonable oppression of the tenants. However, the owner has not only refused to negotiate with the tenants but has also actively exerted pressure, requesting the French Police to send the head of the Songshan Road Police Station, accompanied by several Chinese detectives, to the lane at 6 PM the day before yesterday to notify all tenants to move out immediately and not to occupy the houses forcibly. Upon hearing this news, all the tenants were panicked. They pointed out that the owner was not proceeding according to legal procedures but was illegally requesting police intervention. They believe that if the houses do not pose a threat to public order, the police have no right to interfere. Therefore, they have entrusted legal counsel to provide legal protection and convened an emergency meeting of all members at the Yaxin Temple of the City Federation on Blair Road at 8 PM the night before last. Chaired by Li Yuting, they resolved to unite as one and resolutely oppose the demolition. They will also immediately submit petitions to the City Federation, the District Branch, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, and other organizations, seeking justice and their support.</p>
<h3>Discussion Meeting of the Industrial and Commercial Management Association</h3>
<p>The China Industrial and Commercial Management Association held its 51st luncheon discussion meeting at the Lianhua General Association on Beijing Road yesterday at noon. Over twenty leaders and scholars from the industrial and commercial sectors, including Hu Yongqi, Shen Jiucheng, Cheng Shouzhong, He Qingru, and Tu Zheyin, attended. Dr. Cao Zhaoxiang presided over the meeting. Mr. Hu Yongqi, General Manager of Ning Shao Ren Life Insurance Company, gave a speech on "Group Life Insurance Issues." He stated that group life insurance has several unique characteristics different from ordinary insurance: (1) No medical examination is required. (2) There are insurance benefits payable upon death. (3) Premiums are low. Our industrial and commercial sectors greatly need this type of insurance, as it can allow employees to work with peace of mind and avoid unexpected worries. Currently, 60 out of every 100 people in the United States have life insurance, while only 3 out of every 10,000 people in China have life insurance. Since the introduction of life insurance in 1911, Germany has been the most developed. They can receive insurance benefits when they encounter unemployment or illness, which is extremely important for the stability of social order. He hopes that Chinese industrial and commercial leaders and employees will promote this matter more, which will greatly promote the development of life insurance in our country in the future.</p>

<h3>Korean Drug Manufacturing Operation Uncovered Amidst International Anti-Drug Efforts</h3>
<p>Korean Wei Gaonian Claims Japanese Nationality</p>
<p>Over Fifty Pieces of Drug Manufacturing Equipment Seized</p>
<p>No. 14 Qingyun Lane, Rue Rollin, in the French Concession, is a Korean residence. Yesterday, someone secretly reported to the French police that the address was a secret red pill manufacturing operation and requested that detectives be dispatched to make arrests. Yesterday afternoon, the head detective dispatched armed Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene. They arrested a Korean man, two female servants, and a chauffeur. They seized over three thousand red pills, six to seven taels of morphine, and numerous paper boxes and cloth packages. According to the Korean man, who identified himself as Wei Gaonian and claimed Japanese nationality since childhood, he confessed to manufacturing red pills. He also stated that he had previously manufactured them secretly at No. 310 Pushi Road, but moved to Rue Rollin after the police uncovered the operation. Finally, he revealed that the main facility was located at No. 300 Huanlong Road.

<h3>Huang Naiwu's Appeal in the Caustic Soda Attack on Dance Hostess Case Results in Three-Year Sentence</h3>
<p>The Presiding Judge Stated That a Long Prison Term Would Be Good for Self-Cultivation</p>
<p>The Defendant Expressed Dissatisfaction and Will Appeal to the Supreme Court</p>
<p>Huang Naiwu, a young college student from Jiangxi, previously had a falling out with Li Xiuying (also known as Li Guizhen), a dance hostess at the Da Hu Dance Hall. Huang harbored resentment and paid Jiang Ada, a Suzhou rogue, to accompany him to the Da Hu Dance Hall on the evening of June 20th. He ordered Jiang to throw caustic soda on Li, intending to disfigure her and vent his anger. However, Jiang, in a moment of panic, mistakenly threw the caustic soda on another dance hostess, Qiu Lifei (also known as Li Fei, daughter of Qiu Qiaoyun (Xiao Baocheng), a famous former Xin Wutai actress), splashing her head, face, chest, and back. Police detectives, alerted to the incident, rushed to the scene and arrested Huang and Jiang. They were handed over to the Second Special District Local Court for public prosecution on charges of assault. The victim also filed a private lawsuit seeking damages of $48,000. After repeated hearings, Judge Xiong Hui concluded the trial and sentenced Huang and Jiang to ten months in prison each. The private lawsuit was transferred to the civil court. Huang, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the High Court Third Branch, as previously reported. It is now known that the High Court approved the appeal and held a hearing. Prosecutor Zhang Zongru presented his opinion, stating that the appellant, a young man, did not strive for advancement or focus on his studies. Instead, he spent his parents' hard-earned money in improper dance halls, indulging himself without realizing it, which was already inappropriate for a young man. Now, due to a minor dispute, he incited others to use caustic soda to harm another person's body. In the past, weapons were knives and axes, but now he used caustic soda, a poisonous liquid, which could also cause death and was more harmful than knives. Therefore, he believed that the original sentence of ten months for the appellant was too lenient and insufficient to punish his crime. He requested a severe punishment. The court immediately announced the end of the debate and scheduled a date for sentencing. Yesterday, the court, presided over by Judge Guo Dechang, along with Judges Hong Honglin and Fan Peien, and Prosecutor Zhang, convened Criminal Court Three and ordered Huang Naiwu to be brought to the court to announce the verdict. The original verdict regarding Huang Naiwu's crime and sentence was overturned, and Huang Naiwu was sentenced to three years in prison. The number of days of detention before the final judgment would still be counted at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. After the judgment, the presiding judge explained the meaning of the judgment to Huang, stating that, being young and impulsive, he incited someone to harm another person's body with poisonous liquid due to a minor dispute. He was now sentenced to three years in prison, which would allow him to rest and recuperate in prison for a long time. When he was released from prison in the future, he could still become an accomplished young man. Huang expressed his dissatisfaction in court and stated that he would appeal to the Supreme Court. The court granted his request, and he was taken away by bailiffs to be returned to custody. As for the private lawsuit filed by the victim, Qiu Lifei, it had already been transferred to the civil court. Qiu's request for assistance with the litigation fees was approved. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Xiaoke heard the case in Civil Court Seven. The plaintiff, Qiu Lifei, arrived with her agent, lawyer Wu Peng. The defendants, Huang Naiwu and Jiang Ada, were also brought in from the detention center. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the victim, having been injured, was unable to work, resulting in a loss of 400 yuan per month, or 4,800 yuan per year.

<h3>Missing Beauty from American Ship in Wuhu Found to Have Fled Back to Her Country</h3>
<p>Ship Owner Sends Telegram from Wuhu Confirming</p>
<p>The American merchant ship "Southwick" arrived in Shanghai from the United States and then proceeded to Wuhu to unload cargo. Suddenly, an American sailor went missing, and extensive searches failed to locate him, causing considerable concern. It is now known that he has fled back to his country.

The ship sailed to Wuhu within the past week and docked at the China Merchants Bureau wharf to unload the cargo. The unloading was completed yesterday.</p>

<h3>Liu Liangshi's Body Shows No External Injuries, Autopsy to Be Performed</h3>
<p>Result of Playful Wrestling</p>
<p>Liu Liangshi's Death a Mystery</p>
<p>Liu Liangshi (age 19, from Jiangbei) and Yao Zaiming (age 18, from Ningbo), employees of the China Printing Factory at No. 246 Shouchun Lane, Miller Road, were playfully wrestling with each other at approximately 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, Liu collapsed on the ground after walking only a few steps and lost consciousness. Pang Wei, a female servant in the neighborhood, saw him and immediately reported it to the factory. Liu was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but he died. The hospital reported the death to the Hongkou police, who ordered Detective Xia Shutang to investigate. The detective immediately arrested Yao Zaiming at the factory, took him back to the police station, and detained him. Liu's body was taken to the autopsy room on Ferren Road. Yesterday morning, a police detective escorted Yao to the Criminal Court Three of the First Special District Local Court. As the cause of Liu's death was still to be determined by examination, the court was only requested to detain Yao temporarily. The court granted the request, and Yao was transferred back to the autopsy room to await questioning. At approximately 10:00 AM, Tang, a prosecutor assigned by the court's prosecutor's office, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the autopsy room to examine the body. West Head Detective Brown reported the results of the investigation, and Pang Zhu, age 31, from Pinghu, a female servant at No. 241 Shouchun Lane, stated that she had been out shopping and saw the two men wrestling and laughing. She did not see any fighting. After the two men separated, the deceased suddenly fell to the ground at the factory gate and appeared to be flailing his limbs and unable to speak. She thought he was faking it, so she reported it to the factory staff. Yao Zaiming stated that he did not fight with the deceased, but only wrestled and played with him. Liu Liangyao, age 31, residing in Yongxing Lane, Zhabei, stated that the deceased was his younger brother and that his sudden death was of unknown cause. He requested a detailed investigation. Tang concluded that the deceased had no external injuries and ordered the forensic doctors to perform an autopsy to determine the truth. The inquest was postponed to the 25th of this month, and Liu’s body was claimed by his brother, Liu Liangyao, for burial.</p>
<h3>Young Lodger Commits Suicide in Yangtze Hotel</h3>
<p>Penniless, Possibly Due to Poverty</p>
<p>Lysol as the Deadly Cause</p>
<p>At 11:00 PM the day before yesterday, a male traveler arrived at the Yangtze Hotel at the intersection of Hankou Road and Yunnan Road and requested accommodation. He claimed to be Yang Xueren, 30 years old, a local resident, and had worked as a clerk at the Wancheng Chang foreign goods store on Nanjing Road. The hotel accountant led him to Room 204 and provided him with accommodation. Shortly after, a tea server brought him a meal, and after eating, he closed the door and went to sleep. However, by yesterday noon, he had not yet gotten up. The tea servers grew suspicious and went to listen for movement. They heard moaning and vomiting sounds in the room. When they called out to him, there was no response, and they knew something was wrong. They found a way to open the door and saw the man lying in bed, his face pale. He was unconscious. Upon closer inspection, they found half a bottle of Lysol under the bed. They knew he had taken poison and urgently reported it to the police, who took him to the hospital for treatment. However, he had taken too much poison and soon died. His body was transferred to the autopsy room to await examination. A search of his person revealed that he had no possessions or money. The reason for his suicide was likely due to financial difficulties.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Clarifies Misunderstandings Regarding the Rickshaw Improvement Plan</h3>
<p>The public rickshaws in the Public Concession are currently being improved. Due to the relationship of gains and losses, and the transmission of words, some misunderstandings inevitably arise. Recent reports on the talks between rickshaw owner representatives and the Vehicle Committee regarding the improvement of vehicle styles and the registration of rickshaw pullers have shown some misunderstandings among some people. The Municipal Council has clearly expressed its attitude on these two matters. In March of this year, the Board of Directors resolved to improve the style of the rickshaw as soon as possible. The results of the meeting between the owner representatives and the Municipal Council staff on August 6th were approved by the Board of Directors the next day. Article 8 stated: "The new public rickshaw has been manufactured with reference to the practical suggestions of the owners and pullers and is about to be completed for inspection. After trial use, further suggestions will be considered." All parties knew that the new vehicle was being tested. Later, the owner representatives stated that many old-style cars had recently been built, and if the new style was adopted, these vehicles would be useless. The committee replied that this material could be used for the repair of existing cars. In the future, if the whole car needs to be replaced, the new style must be used. The discussion of using new cars had already appeared in February of this year, but in the three months of March, April, and May, the vehicle inspection office considered that only 278 old cars should be discarded, while the owners themselves replaced 1,686 old cars with new ones. The owners clearly wanted to let the old style occupy the ground before the new style was decided. Therefore, on May 29th, the Vehicle Committee had to declare that new cars could only be used to replace old cars after the vehicle inspection office decided. Recently, the owner representatives requested to submit the new style themselves within a week, and the Vehicle Committee has allowed it. However, the new style must meet the prescribed main standards. According to the previous preparation period for the new style, the Vehicle Committee accepted suggestions from all parties. Now that the new style has been drafted, the Vehicle Committee is still willing to accept opinions before the mandatory adoption is ordered. However, it cannot be delayed for a long time. Recently, the owners who urgently want to build cars have been informed that they can proceed according to the style proposed by the committee. According to reports, the pullers also oppose the new style. In fact, the pullers who have tried pulling the new style of cars have all said that it is smooth and labor-saving, and the passengers who have sat in it have no different opinions on comfort. Even for the owners, the cost of each new style is only 105 yuan, which is also cost-effective compared to the old style. As for the fact that 9,990 new cars require a capital of one million yuan, the Vehicle Committee has repeatedly stated that the replacement of old and new cars will be carried out gradually, and there is no need to invest huge capital at one time. Even if the style of the car is not changed, the gradual replacement of the old owners will also require the same capital. When the owners recently met with the Vehicle Committee, the registration of pullers was only briefly mentioned. The Vehicle Committee has never expressed any intention to abandon or delay the registration of pullers. The owner representatives also mentioned that the current penalty method for violations, regarding the number of days of withholding licenses, is too heavy, and the owners often suffer losses due to the pullers' faults. The Vehicle Committee agreed to investigate, and as a result, the method of withholding licenses has been revised, and most of them have been shortened by half. If it can be considered that the pullers are entirely at fault, the owners can be exempted from punishment.</p>
<h3>Financial Industry to Close Today for the Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>Today (the 23rd) is the Mid-Autumn Festival, a traditional custom. Most banks, money shops, factories, and craft shops in Shanghai will be closed for one day as usual. This year is no exception. Therefore, all Chinese and foreign banks and money shops, factories, and handicraft shops will be closed for one day today. However, since the bank is on a Sunday, it must take an additional day off on the 24th. Thus, the customs will be closed for two days. However, most Chinese banks and money shops will only close for one day on the 23rd, and some will close for two days. As for factories and handicraft shops, they will only close for one day on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>News from the Chinese and Foreign Charity Association</h3>
<p>Zhang Weiji, the general manager of the Catholic Church in Jintan, Liyang, Wuxi, Changzhou, Yixing, and Jiangyin, recently sent a letter to the Chinese and Foreign Charity Association at No. 97 Renji Road, reporting the severe drought in each county. The following is an excerpt from the letter: "After a slight rain in early April of this year, each county only received one or two inches of rainfall until mid-June. With more than two months of extreme heat, a drop in the bucket is of no help. The fields along the major rivers rely on machinery to pump water day and night to ensure the autumn harvest. The fields far away from the major rivers, all small rivers and ports, are cracked at the bottom. The rice seedlings are scorched and cannot be saved. The disaster area does have a difference in scope. The fields in Wuxi that are affected by the disaster account for three-tenths; Changzhou and Jiangyin, four-tenths; Yixing, five-tenths; Jintan and Liyang, eight or nine-tenths. The drought in the two counties can be described as red land for thousands of miles, with no food for the victims. They are all fleeing to other places to beg for food. In the Yixing area, people are seen carrying their children and walking on foot along the highway, begging for food along the way. Selling daughters and sons, starvation, and death are all tragic scenes that are unbearable to hear and see. There are also fishermen who live on their boats and rely on catching fish and shrimp in the river to make a living. Most of them have no food for the next day. Unexpectedly, they have encountered this river drying up, the boats cannot move, and they are helpless and waiting for death. Although there has been rain now, and the boats can barely move, the water has been dry for a long time, the fish and shrimp are exhausted, and there is still no livelihood. Their faces are thin and their bodies are like birds, and their suffering is unspeakable. It is estimated that there are more than 10,000 fishermen affected by the disaster in Xijing, and more than 10,000 in Changzhou and Yixing. The victims by land and water are waiting to be fed. If they are not rescued, they will surely starve to death."</p>
<h3>Autumn Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax: Municipal Finance Bureau Dispatches Police to Collect</h3>
<p>Tobacco Dealers in Nanshi Plead for Consideration</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Zengji, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, previously received an order from the Ministry of Finance to take over the collection of tobacco and alcohol license tax in the city for the autumn season of this year. Collection began on July 1st. Tax collection offices have increased the number of staff, adding more than ten people to each office, to carry out rectification and spare no effort to enrich tax revenue and promote municipal construction. However, the staff are new to the job and unfamiliar with the routes, leading to delayed investigations and reviews. As the autumn season is coming to an end and the winter season is about to begin, the Finance Bureau has recently dispatched police officers to collect licenses from tobacco and alcohol merchants, hoping to end this phase. According to the industry, the Finance Bureau does not show consideration when renewing licenses and collects additional taxes from other businesses, and the procedures are troublesome. The directors of the east and west districts of the city are able to understand the difficulties of the merchants and still collect taxes according to the original rates of two yuan and four yuan. The autumn collection has ended, and the merchants are celebrating. There have been slight changes in the north of the city, but most of those who have been taxed more are in the south of the city. The tax collection office stipulates that the collection office hours are only from 9:00 to 11:00 in the morning and from 1:00 to 3:00 in the afternoon each day. The time is short, and the office is closed on Sundays and holidays, so those who travel from afar to collect are disappointed. Recently, there are many small shops run by husband and wife or unemployed merchants, with only women and apprentices, and few people. They find it difficult to pay taxes and obtain licenses. The procedures are unclear, and they suffer from additional taxes, stamp duty violations, and other hardships. Chen Changji at No. 15 Licangqiao Street, Yi Jufeng at No. 563 Quzhenren Road, Yuanda at Baodai Lane, Xiaodongmen, Qian Ruiji at Dada Lane, Lu Jintai at No. 98 Ninghe Road, Jiating at No. 12 Xilinhou Road, Shenghe at No. 68 Dajing Road, Qiyunzhai at No. 39 Wangyun Road, Saixin at No. 51 Houjia Road, and more than 300 other shops have jointly signed a letter to the Tobacco Industry Association, requesting that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce negotiate with the authorities.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Our manager, Guo Shun, went to Hong Kong by ship on the 12th of this month and has not yet returned. Recently, I read a news report in your newspaper about Guo Shun going to Jiangxi to visit Chiang Kai-shek, which is obviously a rumor. I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Wing On Textile Co., Ltd., September 22 To the Editor: On September 21, your newspaper published (a news report about a Jilin University student causing a car accident). After investigation, Lan Fuming, who was driving the car, was expelled from the school after the end of the first semester of the 21st academic year after being screened by the school's affiliated high school. He is no longer a student of our school, and there are no students from our school in the car. The report in your newspaper is slightly inconsistent with the facts. Please correct it. Sincerely, National Jinan University, September 21.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Is Singing and Dancing Art?</h3>
<p>| Answer to Mr. Liu Dake |</p>
<p>(Is Singing and Dancing Also Art?)</p>
<p>(I understand the benefits of watching movies and pictures, but what else is there to singing and dancing besides giving people sexual stimulation? Singing and dancing, such as the Vaudeville, are considered great, and I have seen them, but what can we get from there? Lascivious songs, sensual dances, except for the curves of the thighs,...)</p>
<p>Mr. Dake's words can only be said to be a kind of indignation. As far as the current popular singing and dancing is concerned, perhaps it is okay, but if you therefore fundamentally deny the artistic nature of singing and dancing, then there is a lot of room for discussion.</p>
<p>We know that singing and dancing are the origin of all art. Almost as soon as there were humans, there were singing and dancing. Their relationship with human labor is closer than any other art. They are closely related to labor. In primitive times, singing was the direct voice of labor; the sounds that humans made when laboring (iya iya) were the original music; dancing was a re-exercise of human labor skills. For example, in the hunting era, dancing was practicing hunting, imitating the movements of wild animals. However, after the development of production tools, singing and dancing gradually separated from social production and life along with the development of other arts. Singing and dancing are an art that gradually achieves a beautiful effect from a practical effect and is the most accessible art for the masses.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the current popular singing and dancing has completely separated from the masses and has become a form of entertainment for a few people, but this still cannot deny its artistic existence. Art is the expression of beauty. A work of art is mainly able to arouse the sensual and intellectual satisfaction of the audience or listeners. You may feel bored when you see sensual dances and lewd songs, but some people are precisely indulging in this kind of temptation and anesthesia. This is precisely its artistic effect. If, as you said, singing and dancing do not contain artistry, then those manufacturers of song and dance films would no longer need to invest heavily in them. Therefore, our opposition to popular singing and dancing should stand on a certain point of view, point out the social roots of its occurrence, because the occurrence of lewd singing and dancing still has its social background, point out that Daodong singing and dancing is the degradation of singing and dancing art, is far away from the masses, and can never completely obliterate the artistic nature of singing and dancing. This is just like the literature of praise in literature, and the literature of sex in triangular and quadrangular relationships. We can never question whether these make literature an art.</p>
<p>Moreover, even now, singing and dancing are more artistic than any other art. Needless to say, many folk songs popular in the countryside are precisely the exposure of their feelings. The group cards and stage corners at competitions still retain the remnants of mass dances. Taking a step back, because singing and dancing have a direct impact on hearing and vision, a tragic song is more likely to move some small-literacy people than thousands of giant works. This should be an unquestionable fact. In this way, not only is it unacceptable to fundamentally deny the artistry of singing and dancing, but also passive opposition to the currently popular song and dance films is not enough. We should actively make singing and dancing escape from lewdness and build a mass song and dance with higher art.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Library Open All Year Round</h3>
<p>No Holidays, Open for Reading All Year</p>
<p>Convenient Reading, Open Day and Night</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Library has a history of more than twenty years since its initial establishment as a repository of books. It has accumulated over 260,000 volumes of Chinese and foreign books. Its collection of the Wenhange edition of the "Complete Library of the Four Treasuries," meticulously replenished after being damaged, is a major repository of cultural relics in the Southeast. Recently, with the addition of new library buildings and improved facilities, it is one of the most well-equipped public libraries in the country. Since taking over in January of the 21st year of the Republic, Director Chen Xun-ci has dedicated himself to improving all aspects of the library. The library now uses the new building on Daxue Road, donated by the Tang family, as its main library, serving as the center for book storage and all facilities. There are two branch libraries: one in Gushan, specializing in the storage of the "Four Treasuries" and other rare books, and one on Xinmin Road, which serves as a popular library with a dedicated children's room. Last year, the total number of readers and borrowers was 100,360 (excluding magazines). Since the main library opened two years ago, its opening hours have been extended repeatedly. After August of last year, it was also open at night. Starting in September of this year, it has been decided that it will be open all year round, with no closures on public holidays. The reporter observed that among the public libraries in the country, except for the Beiping Library, which is open every day of the year, most libraries have one day off per week, usually on Mondays. Now, this library is breaking the holiday tradition, setting an example for libraries nationwide. Therefore, the newly established measures are specially explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Open All Year Round: The library, recognizing its service to the community, believes that it should provide reading access to the public every day within its capabilities and should not close one day per week like ordinary offices. Therefore, after detailed planning, starting from September 1st, the regulation of closing on public holidays (Mondays) has been abolished, and the policy of being open every day of the year has been adopted. Therefore, from now on, the library can be said to be open all year round, without a single day of rest, except for New Year's Day, National Day, and special commemorative days.</p>
<p>(2) Day and Night Reading: The Xinmin branch library has been open at night since the 18th year of the Republic. The main library, in its first year, was only open during the day. After August of last year, the hours were extended to 9 p.m., but reading was suspended for one hour each during lunch and dinner times, i.e., from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. Now, considering that lunch and dinner times vary for different people and that stopping for an hour is inconvenient for those who come from afar to read, starting from September 1st, the continuous, uninterrupted arrangement has been adopted. From now on, the opening hours are from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, a continuous twelve hours. Readers will not be disappointed at any time, from morning to night.</p>
<p>(3) Provision of Meals: The library, also considering the inconvenience for readers who stay in the library all day to read or who come around lunchtime and have not finished reading and do not want to leave for meals, has decided to provide meals for readers. Lunch and dinner can be taken in the library, with a charge of only fifteen cents per person. This measure is particularly convenient for those who come from afar. Since its implementation, the number of readers has surged. Recently, the number of full-day readers has often exceeded five hundred. However, the above facilities are currently limited to the main library on Daxue Road. The Gushan and Xinmin branch libraries, due to financial limitations, still take Mondays as holidays, but the opening hours have also been extended. The Xinmin branch library is open from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m., and the Gushan branch library is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
<p>In other news, the library building of the Gushan branch library, built in the second year of the Republic, has been in disrepair for some time. The library, recognizing the importance of the rare books of the "Four Treasuries," submitted a request to the Department of Education for an appropriation of three hundred yuan for repairs in July. The repairs have now been completed, and the interior has been completely renovated. It will reopen soon. This library houses 50,000 volumes of rare books, as well as all 180,000 blocks of woodblocks for books printed and sold by the former Zhejiang Official Book Bureau, which the library inherited. These are also stored there, and the book catalog is still available for ordering by mail.</p>
<h3>National Products Mobile Exhibition Held Yesterday at Wuben Girls' School</h3>
<p>Also Held a Tea Party for Students Using National Products</p>
<p>The National Products Mobile Exhibition, sponsored by the Women's National Products Year Movement Committee, was held yesterday at Wuben Girls' Middle School in Nanshi. More than two thousand students and off-campus guests visited. Various factories distributed free gifts on site. In the afternoon, a discussion meeting on students using national products was also held, attended by Principal Yan Zhenyu, all faculty members, and student representatives from all grades, totaling sixty to seventy people. Chairman Ni Baiyan delivered the opening speech, followed by a speech by Principal Yan Zhenyu, who hoped that the organizers would introduce factory products and provide long-term displays so that students could recognize and purchase them. In order to stimulate students' interest in using national products, the Zhongnan Industrial Factory and the Rongxin Embroidery Thread Factory held a character-guessing and sentence-guessing contest on the spot. Many students guessed correctly and were very interested. After the prize-guessing deadline, the factory supervised the opening of the riddle by the organizers and presented exquisite products separately. Ye Hongfan, a representative of the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, in order to promote national product sneakers, initiated a friendly basketball game between the faculty and staff of the school, which was spirited and grand.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Sends Personnel to Investigate Schools Established by the工部局</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau has been earnestly carrying out the regulations of the Ministry of Education regarding the reorganization of schools. It is learned that, in addition to all private schools in the city having successively applied for registration, the First Chinese Primary School established by the公董局 of the French Concession has already been approved and filed by the Education Bureau. Recently, the schools run by the工部局 of the Public Concession have also been requested by the工部局 to be filed with the Education Bureau. It is now reported that the Education Bureau sent personnel to the schools on the previous two days to conduct on-site investigations.</p>
<h3>Books to be Published Should be Submitted to the Ministry of Interior for Review</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Issued a Proclamation</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Government issued Proclamation No. 75, stating: "According to the Ministry of Interior's Jingzi No. 908 correspondence, it is found that books to be published should be submitted to the Ministry for review in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 of the Publishing Law. The Ministry has repeatedly issued orders to inform publishers of publications in various places, and has convened booksellers from Beijing and Shanghai to discuss and formulate measures to ban the sale of prohibited publications, which have been promulgated and implemented. Recently, it has been found that some books published in various places have not been submitted to the Ministry for review in accordance with the regulations before being published, which is a violation of laws and regulations. Now, it is hereby again requested to instruct the relevant local publishers to submit all kinds of books that have not been submitted to the Ministry for review in accordance with the law, and only then will they be allowed to be published. If they still neglect to comply, they will be seriously punished by the relevant local authorities in accordance with the law, without any leniency. In addition to distributing the order, it is also necessary to request to check and instruct the subordinates to implement it conscientiously, and to publish an announcement in the newspaper to inform the public. It is hoped that the handling situation will be reported. This has been approved. In addition to ordering the Education Bureau to forward it to the Book Industry Association for information and reporting back, it is necessary to issue a proclamation to inform the public."</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Association Prepares for Re-election</h3>
<p>Various Districts Reorganize Old Members and Recruit New Members</p>
<p>Must Report to the Education Bureau for Review Before the End of September</p>
<p>The term of office of the first board of directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Municipal Education Association has expired, and a re-election is scheduled for next month. Various district education associations are now busy reorganizing old members and recruiting new members in order to convene a general membership meeting, produce representatives, and participate in the re-election. The Municipal Education Bureau requires that the qualifications of members in each district be submitted to the bureau for review. Yesterday, it issued a notice to the education associations in various districts, stating: "According to Article 7 of the Education Association Law, the qualifications of members of the education associations in various districts should be reviewed by a membership qualification review committee organized by the supervisory authority, and only those who pass the review can become members. It is found that the membership lists submitted to the bureau by the education associations in various districts one after another in preparation for the upcoming re-election of the Shanghai Municipal Education Association are not in compliance with the regulations. It is now limited to the end of September to follow the following methods: (1) Re-create and re-report the membership list of old members of the Ministry of Education, except for those who have left the district. (2) Prepare a separate list of old members who have left the district and report it for record. (3) New members recruited this time should prepare a list and report it for approval. Before the review is approved, they shall not be members of the association. (4) The education associations in various districts must wait for the new members to pass the review before submitting an application to hold a meeting, otherwise it will not be recognized. All education associations in various districts should comply. This is a special notice."</p>
<h3>China Vocational Education Society Pilots Rural Mass Education Field</h3>
<p>Excellent Results After Three Weeks</p>
<p>Gradually Promote to Improve Rural Areas</p>
<p>Since the completion of the Xu Gongqiao Six-Year Plan, the China Vocational Education Society has moved its talent to the Shanghai suburbs between Wujiaxiang and Zhuanqiao on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road to actively carry out the improvement area for suburban rural areas in Shanghai. There are already clues to hiring Lu Shu'ang as the general instructor and director of the Zhaojiaxiang Office, Li Chucai as the director of the Jinjiatang Office, and Shen Jinong as the director of the Wujiaxiang Office. The forty-two members of the Caohejing Agricultural Friendship Group, which is affiliated to it, are divided into various offices and work together. At present, rural investigation fields, animal husbandry fields, cooperatives, rural elementary schools, and simple clinics have been successively held. Recently, considering that adult farmers should also be trained spiritually in addition to material needs, the methods of the mass schools that were previously run were incorrect, and the effectiveness was difficult to achieve. Therefore, there is a pilot project for rural mass education fields. Every night from 7 pm to 9 pm, male and female farmers over the age of 20 sit together, and the staff of the office first report current affairs for 20 minutes (farmers can also report local news at this time), instruct common sense for 20 minutes, then literacy for 30 minutes (new words or short articles are related to what was said that day), then entertainment for 20 minutes (gramophone, silk bamboo, or folk storytelling), and finally discuss local development matters. A commemorative week is held every Monday night for 10 minutes. Zhaojiatang was the first to pilot one place, and it has been three weeks. Every night, the masses arrive, even if the wind and rain do not decrease slightly, and the order becomes more and more orderly, and the national consciousness increases day by day. On the 918 Memorial Day, some cried or raised their arms and shouted. Jinjiatang and Wujiaxiang will open at the beginning of next month and will gradually promote the entire area to increase the help of improving the countryside.</p>
<h3>List of Wang Boyuan Individual University Scholarship Recipients (Part 1)</h3>
<p>I believe that things are more important than reality, not empty talk. Therefore, I have been running scholarships for three years now, and I have never done any publicity work with a single piece of paper, so the outside world has absolutely no knowledge of it. However, there are particularly many people who request the scholarship this year. Although more than 60 people have been given funding, there are still a majority who have not received it. I can't help but regret the omission of pearls, and those who have not received the award often do not ask themselves how their grades are, and they even complain with annoyance, and some even use phone calls or letters to laugh and scold, doing everything. Because of this, I have to publish the list of those who have received the award in the newspaper to show great faith and hope that the students will study hard and that there will still be a chance to receive the award in the future, and to hope that those who support this move will hear the news and follow up, so that more scholars will benefit and society will be fortunate and education will be fortunate. Boyuan attached</p>

<p>Youyou's Atmosphere is Completely New</p>
<p>Youyou's return of Nan'an's youngsters has brought a completely new atmosphere. Except for goalkeeper Xu Xiang, who was absent due to illness, Yang Mingjin's substitute was also satisfactory, saving many dangerous balls. The defense is still acceptable, and Li Huiming is steady and reliable. Wang Nanzhen, the top scorer, has missed many opportunities due to his lack of experience, which is a pity. The cooperation of the three right-wingers is the best, and their sharpness is greatly displayed. The connection between Zhong, Sun, and Luo is extremely skilled. Zhong Yuxiang, the new general from Java, is brave and good at running, and has the style of Xu Yahui, but his shooting action is slow. He can work harder and become a special talent. In terms of Youyou's current strength, it is still lacking. The left wing is missing, and the left defender also needs to add other forces.</p>
<h3>Caught Off Guard, the Enemy Advanced First</h3>
<p>Several good players from French Business were absent. Goalkeeper Fulushou, and Pike Kaositai, etc., did not arrive, so the air defense was empty, and Youyou was able to take advantage of this to approach. Remi Di alone in the midfield was not enough to rely on. Qinsheng, who came from Lux, was absolutely not enough to monitor Zhong Yongsen. It is a pity that Youyou's players lack leg strength, otherwise the score could have been much more impressive. The forwards have no connection at all, and it will take time to become skilled. As soon as Chen kicked off, Youyou took the initiative. The ball came from the left wing. Fafanqie dribbled the ball in. Liang Shutang was caught off guard and reached the bottom line. With a cross, Ke Lai Teren kicked in due to Old Jiang's mistake and was shot in. It was only one minute after the start.</p>
<h3>Old Sun's Iron Legs Scored Continuously</h3>
<p>The midfield restarted, and Youyou took the offensive fiercely. Both the left and right corners approached at the same time, but they did not succeed three times. After seven minutes, Zhong Yongsen flew in from the right and hit the goal fiercely, which was saved by Qinsheng outside the line, becoming a corner kick. Then, Fu Zhong, Liang Shutang intercepted and passed to Zhong Yuxiang. Zhong kicked it to Sun, who happened to be no one in front of the goal, and flew up with his iron legs, also scoring, making it one to one. Three minutes later, Yang Mingjin pounced to save Ke Laituo's grounded ball. Luo Haiguang received the ball from behind and circled straight up, passing it to Sun Jinshun. The iron legs flew again, making it two to one. Five minutes before the end of the first half, Luo Haiguang rushed up to shoot. Lamon pounced to save. Although the ball touched his hand, it still rolled into the net. In the first half, Youyou took the lead with three to one.</p>
<h3>The Final Effort Became Four Pairs</h3>
<p>In the second half, Chen Zhenxiang was injured, and Li Huiming substituted for him, which was still satisfactory. Zhong Yuxiang also rested and came out. The opponent's lineup also changed slightly, so the situation gradually eased. Zhong Yongsen was not as hardworking as in the first half, but Youyou still had the upper hand. Although French Business occasionally harassed, it was not worth mentioning. In the game, Sun Jinshun again shot fiercely at the goal, which was saved by Lamon. Zhong Yongsen once hooked a ball, but Luo Haiguang kicked it, and it was invalidated because it had gone out of bounds. Xiao Zhong again went deep alone, but was blocked by Qinsheng because he was too slow. Things like this are all regrettable. Unexpectedly, in the last five minutes, a stimulant suddenly came. Old Sun's iron legs shot the goal, which was pushed out by Lamon. Suddenly, Liang Shutang flashed out and kicked in from behind, also hitting Honghu, and the ending became four to one.</p>
<h3>The Ball Was Auctioned for One Hundred and Fifteen Yuan</h3>
<p>After the game, because it was a charity game, the ball was auctioned as usual. Chen Shao of the Youyou Association executed it. Sure enough, someone took out the money, and there were many generous people. Finally, the great philanthropist Shao Jingfu bought the football for a price of one hundred and fifteen yuan, which is admirable.</p>

<h3>The First Sound of the Northern Expedition, Donghua Defeats Beining</h3>
<p>Result: One to Zero</p>
<p>Today's Battle Against the Army Joint Team</p>
<p>(Tianjin, 22nd) This afternoon at 4 PM, the Donghua Football Team played against the Beining Team at Ning. There were two types of tickets, five jiao and two jiao. There were more than two thousand male and female spectators. There was no grandstand in the field. Those with five-jiao tickets temporarily set up seats, and those with two-jiao tickets stood around the perimeter, with crowds gathering and crowding. The game started on time at 4 PM and ended at 5:30 PM. Donghua defeated Beining by a score of one to zero. On the 23rd, at 3 PM, they will play against the Army Joint Team at the English ball field. Tickets will be divided into three types: one yuan, five jiao, two jiao.</p>
<p>Li Yichen Headed in a Goal, Tianjin, 22nd Electric Report Today's ball battle, Donghua attacked from east to west in the first half, and Beining defended from west to east. After the kickoff, Donghua immediately took the offensive. Li Yichen dribbled the ball quickly and passed it to Wan Xianghua, who was blocked. He passed it again to Dai Jing, who shot at a distance of 20 yards but missed. Beining got the ball and Liang Mingzong passed it to Qin Ming, who brought it to Donghua's defense, where it was intercepted by Li Ning and kicked out. The ball was obtained by Li Yichen, who went all the way in and passed it to Chen Hongguang, who shot at the goal, but also went too high and out of bounds. After that, the two sides attacked each other several times, but because the defense was appropriate, they could not be divided. Beining got several corner kick opportunities and free kicks, but all kicked out without success. At 20 minutes from the kickoff, Dai Lingjing grabbed a ball from Sun Sijing, dribbled into Beining's belly, and was blocked by his defender. He passed it to Hongguang, who shot diagonally from the door, landing in front of the door. Li Yichen jumped up and headed, and the ball went into the net, winning a goal. Then it suddenly rained, and the attack and defense were not effective. The first half ended here.</p>
<p>No Gain in Heavy Rain (Tianjin, 22nd Electric Report) In the second half, the rain became heavier, and although the spectators were exposed to the rain, they did not disperse. The two teams changed places to fight in the rain. Beining tried to recover, and the five forwards and three center defenders besieged the university. Lu Zhongen relied on his long body to catch high and low, guarding the mountain gate without any leakage. Once Jiang Lu got the ball, he cut through the barrier and passed it to Qin Ming, Qin selected a suitable position, and Li Ning relied on his back-up skills to squeeze out. Once Beining Qin Ming dribbled the ball to the front of the door, Li Guan's two guards were surrounded and could not be rescued. Lu pounced out and crushed Qin Ming, and Li Ning got a chance to kick it out of bounds. After fifteen minutes, Beining's energy waned, and Donghua's application of contact work became more active, and the ball was all in front of Beining's goal, turning around, and several times because of the rainy ground, the wet ball was heavy and did not turn and failed. When the silver horn sounded, there was no achievement in the second half. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua</p>
<p>Feng Yunggu, Wan Xianghua</p>
<p>Li Ning, Li Yichen</p>

<p>Women's Corner</p>
<h3>There is no such thing as a transitional period!</h3>
<p>— Qi Su</p>
<p>In the discussion on the issue of "virtuous mother and good wife," there is a thorough theory like that of Ms. Yun Qi, who affirms the virtuous mother and good wife system from a historical perspective as a product of feudal society. It is a cunning means used by men to confine women into becoming domestic slaves. Anyone who praises the virtuous mother and good wife system is driving history backward. Of course, "history is advancing"! When the feudal system has already become a relic, to praise the virtuous mother and good wife system again is undoubtedly a wing of "restoration," it is driving backwards! However, in Mr. Li Hu's "disagreement" (refutation), it is believed that the interpretation of the virtuous mother and good wife system "often changes with the changing times." I also admire this view, but unfortunately, although "its interpretation" changes with the changing times, the essence of the virtuous mother and good wife system, which occurred and became fearful in feudal society, and also became historical dregs with the collapse of feudal society, can never be subjectively designated as having "changed" into something else due to the changing times. History is indeed advancing as Mr. Li Hu said, but it does not advance with the dregs! History discards things that have been eliminated in its development. Therefore, what Mr. Li Hu said is just an interpretation. And the "essence" meaning of those who praise, as we know it, is not satisfied with interpretation, its true face is to have women abandon society and lock themselves in the family. This can save many "rustling" or other troubles. No matter how beautifully it is decorated with interpretations, it is always a kind of deception and oppression of women in essence. We stand on the viewpoint of serving society and fundamental equality in politics and economics. I affirm that women should be liberated from the trivial matters of raising children and the family, and occupy a social position like men, serving society and making society advance! Moreover, under the progress of the times, most women are having to leave home or have no home to return to.</p>
<p>However, there are also those like Mr. Pan Yihong who raise the issue of: "a serious transitional period" has come. Roughly, they think, since the old has been overthrown and the new has not yet been built, what should we do? But I want to say resolutely: there is no such thing as a so-called "transitional period"! The development of history is not like "the old official has left, and the new official has not yet taken office," an empty period. The development of history is that the old gradually disappears in the face of the new; the new arises and develops in the old. This is a connected whole and a dynamic relationship! We must not mechanically cut the development of history into sections, and think that there is a transitional period between this section and that section. Taking the issue of "virtuous mother and good wife" as an example, the old feudal relationship of women is not already eliminated, but is being eliminated; the new equal status of women is also not yet established, but is developing, that is, the new is growing in conflict with the old. And in such a dynamic relationship, our "serious" task is: how to overthrow and eliminate the old, and how to make the new develop and establish. But it is not necessary to create a transitional period to act as a compromise to maintain the status quo, a compromising method is a clumsy method and does not help solve the real problem.</p>
<p>Finally: I say again, discussing the issue of "virtuous mother and good wife" from a dynamic dialectical point of view, I affirm that "there is no such thing as a transitional period"!</p>
<h3>Green Ripple's Thorny Heart and Green Ripple at the Time of Writing Thorny Heart</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xue</p>
<p>"Thorny Heart" is a tragic and beautiful masterpiece, loved by most kind and noble ladies, possessing a magnetic attraction and an electric touch. Because this is an autobiographical work, from here, we can see Green Ripple's worldview and outlook on life at the time of writing "Thorny Heart." What kind of person was Green Ripple at the time of writing "Thorny Heart"? Let her tell it herself: "She is a young woman with a strong rationality and extremely rich emotions. She approves of materialist philosophy, while also requiring spiritual life, leaning towards scientific principles, while also being rich in literary emotions." A noble lady who retains the breath of yesterday, is dazzled by today, and is hazy about tomorrow!</p>
<p>The depiction of "Thorny Heart" has three focuses: First, the atmosphere of love (especially maternal love). Second, the atmosphere of praise for nature. Third, the religious atmosphere. This book is full of the breath of people, the breath of soil, and the breath of God. However, these three focuses are consistent, we can all attribute them to "love" - all of them start from love and return to love.</p>
<p>Small property owners have two typical types: one is passive, conservative, and peaceful; the other is splashing - splashing madly, and indignant (but only with individual courage). These two types also have a common point, that is, they are equally detached from reality.</p>
<p>Humanitarians and misanthropes belong to the first type. (However, to say that humanitarians and misanthropes are passive, some people may say: "This is a pedantic statement!" They have fire-like enthusiasm, they are the most active people. However, we do not focus on the motivation but on the practice, so that statement will not be too wrong.) They only hide in the traps of the current system to make local efforts, or hide in the folds of society, performing a kind of chronic suicide.</p>
<p>Characters belonging to the second type tend to another extreme. Their enthusiasm creates their color blindness, they run wild in society with a cynical attitude, hoping that the universe will sink, or (for the revolution, like towards a new wife, singing hundreds of millions of praises and iron eulogies at the top of their voices), but in fact, they are completely ignorant of the revolution.</p>
<p>We can probably put Green Ripple at the time of writing "Thorny Heart" into this file of humanitarians, because in "Thorny Heart," apart from love and compassion, we can hardly find anything else.</p>
<p>Xingqiu's mother "is accustomed to the taste of parting," parting with her husband every year, and parting with her children who go to school. This is indeed a common painful experience for housewives suffering in the family. However, the core of the problem is not that they are separated from their husbands and children, but that they do not have independent personalities in a male-centered society, and have no support other than their parents, husbands, and children. Living and studying are both necessary, Xingqiu's desire for knowledge and homesickness stubbornly oppose each other, and to overcome this contradiction, it is not that the husband gives up his job to stay with his wife, or that the daughter rushes back to her hometown from France before finishing her studies. What created the suffering of Xingqiu's mother, and at the same time created Xingqiu's "heartbreaking guilt"? Is it Xingqiu's fortitude? Wrong!</p>
<p>Xingqiu worships "spiritual chastity," believing that "the importance of spiritual chastity is even above the physical. She is already a fiancé, and she will inevitably marry him in the future, and she should give him all her love." Xingqiu fully demonstrates here a half-new, half-old woman dragging the tail of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>"Spiritual chastity" and love supremacy are of the same lineage, and "the importance of spiritual chastity is even above the physical" is even less like something that someone who approves of materialist philosophy would say. Xingqiu has never even met her fiancé, and in the future she will "inevitably" marry him and should give him all her love, which is something that awakened women today should not want.</p>
<p>The chapter "Nursing Sickness on Lake Lemán" writes: "There are no tears here, only laughter, no war, only peace." I don't know that the laughter here is built on the tears of the hard-working masses of this country and small nations, and the peace here is built on war. Small property owners are inevitably short-sighted, they only see a small circle of environment around themselves, they have not shot their eyes into the distance, they only see the trees, not the forest. The whole book praises France, without a single word of profound analysis of this imperialism.</p>
<p>Xingqiu sees the nuns "completely consuming their beautiful youth, love, and happiness between medicine stoves and tea pots, their work has no reward, spiritual comfort is their greatest reward, and their sacrifice does not seek the praise of the world, but only seeks to conform to God's holy will." Seeing Blanc and Massa carrying the cross to seek welfare for the sick and the poor, she is deeply moved, expressing lofty admiration for their "motivation and enthusiasm"; but Xingqiu clearly does not see the surging "eat-church" people: clearly ignores the role played by Christians in the hinterland of small nations as landlords, usurers, and local emperors; not knowing that these people are objectively the best tools of rulers and oppressors, covering up the truth, whitewashing the demons of the world, and supporting their crumbling rule, paralyzing the nerves of the oppressed, and eliminating the fighting emotions of the oppressed; at the same time, the machine of the private system manufactures rolling waves of poor people at an electric rate, and one Blanc and Massa simply cannot finish helping.</p>
<p>Belief is necessary for people suffering in contradiction, we must have a kind of certainty about tomorrow, a kind of unyielding belief in the truth obtained from objective reality, but not to believe in an illusion created by an individual, but to objectively serve the enemy. "Faith is the activity of the highest spiritual power of mankind," because there is a kind of faith, "human nature is selfish, can be transformed into altruism, human nature is cowardly, can be transformed into bravery." This statement is correct.</p>
<p>Due to insufficient knowledge, although Xingqiu has been baptized by science and understands the truth that "people turn to God when they have something to ask of God," she has finally converted, and has not been able to overcome and unify this contradiction.</p>
<p>Xingqiu seems to understand a little bit of materialism, but only understands "a little bit," and it is also distorted. "Materialists tell us... the difference between humans and animals is only a matter of degree, not of nature, that is, compared with inanimate objects such as humans and wood and stone, it is only a matter of degree of height. Determinism tells us that the will is not free, and that the will is only a necessary action." The materialism here is vulgar mechanism, and the determinism here is morphine-like fatalism. Scientific materialism believes that there is also a qualitative difference between humans and apes, and scientific materialism has never seen human freedom fall, and the masters have only said such things: "Freedom is the recognition of necessity."</p>
<p>Xingqiu loves the motherland, and believes that the rampant bandits are a great shame to the motherland, which shows the revisionist Xingqiu's infatuation with the status quo. Rampant bandits are the activism of the oppressed and the shaking of the current rule, which is objectively not a "shame" but good news. Although she has never hated the warlords, and understands that bandits are the product of civil war, she has no more concrete opinions other than cursing them to perish on their own. It's just cursing, will cursing them lead to their demise? No, the only way is to shoulder the great banner of rebellion, just like devout religious people carrying the cross.</p>
<p>This is the impression that Green Ripple's "Thorny Heart" and Green Ripple at the time of writing "Thorny Heart" gave me!</p>
<p>However, the times are changing rapidly, and Ms. Green Ripple is not immutable. The current Green Ripple and the Green Ripple of the "Thorny Heart" era are two different faces. Recently, she wrote an article "On Shen Congwen" in the Literary Monthly, which confirmed the above sentence.</p>
<h3>Soviet Wives (4) (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ann Louise Strong, translated by Liang Qiu</p>
<p>We too have our ethics. If Americans disapprove of our easy marriages and easy divorces, then we too disapprove of the seduction of the sexes in their dramas and movies. ("I know your American movies 丨丨 a lot of kissing," a Soviet youth once sarcastically said.) The hypocritical suppression in ancient marriages, the sweet romance of the sexes; treating marriage as the purpose of life, or the many gender issues discussed in Western countries after the European War, are all useless to us. No drama with a love triangle is worth our discussing all night. With us, "triangle" does not refer to the relationship between the sexes, but to the managers of the factory, that is, the director, the union, and the party secretary; this is the "triangle" in our daily conversation. Perhaps this is the symbol of our lives.</p>
<p>If there is a proper criticism of our ethics, it is that we are too indifferent to gender issues 丨丨 not too concerned. External competition and novelty attract our entire minds, and we have no time to pay attention to the profundity and enjoyment of personal life. Our young men and women know the advantages of their new friendship, and married people feel that their partners are freer and more intimate than in any other country in the world.</p>
<p>Because we are worker bees in a beehive, the drones whose purpose of life is mating are the object of our sting. Our ideals are large farms and factories, our emotions are filled with endless plans, and our illusions are: "the conquest of the world by mankind." Sex life is a torch that illuminates and warms those who stop on this journey. If someone asks us if we feel personal happiness, our answer is: we have not experienced it, and we have no time to experience it. Because our lives face the outside world, every scientific invention, every airplane passing through the North Sea, this is our new stimulus.</p>
<p>What is wrong with us not paying attention to personal life? When we think like this, we immediately remember the words of an American psychiatrist, Dr. William. He thought that the origin of most American neuroses was "noisy" families. Psychoanalysts have found that every man and woman with property has neurotic phenomena. In the Soviet Union, because of our rational, non-property-related marriages, and our dedication to the outside world, neuroses and mental illnesses are rare. Some Soviets believe that individual hedonism, like doctrines contrary to religion, is the result of spiritual dryness.</p>
<p>An old Communist Party member said to me a few years ago: "Before the European War, we fought for justice and rights, and our era is fighting for automobiles or toothbrushes. In my opinion, the ultimate goal is the human heart; but this goal cannot be reached until another fifty years. This generation and the next are designing and manufacturing machines, and the human heart is focused on these things. Only the next generation will have time to explore various deeper questions in the world."</p>
<p>Will future people be like this? Or are these words just absurd ravings? This is what modern Soviets can criticize. However, there is one thing that I think is very certain. That is; whether our way of life and love is the rational way of the future era, or just a temporary revolution against the possessiveness of the past property, this revolution will be replaced by a richer individual and social life in the future; but in this world, in this era, there is no happier, more complete path of life.</p>

<h3>Mother and Daughter</h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>Whether it was sunny or cloudy, whether it was dust filling the sky or mud covering the ground, Sister-in-law Jin always had to harness a skinny, chicken-like gray-black mule in front of the wooden-wheeled cart, braving the wind and rain to the marketplace to pick up work. The exchange of bitter cold and sweltering heat tormented this lonely heart, transforming a young widow into a seasoned and hardy old woman. The wrinkled face and wrinkled hands were ten times older than her age. Yet, her own daughter was only nineteen years old. Whenever she thought of her daughter, Xiao Liu, or when people asked about the missing girl, she would always wear a bitter face, speechless for a long time, the veins throbbing in her temples, recalling a girl who was not too foolish. She had leaned on her mother's warm embrace and spent one harsh winter after another on the mule cart, wrapped in rags like a dead toad, unable to move, her face frozen white and purple, making the woman wonder about her life and death, but in the end, she had survived.</p>
<p>"Xiao Liu, when will she come back?"</p>
<p>She couldn't answer this question herself. She remembered the old squad leaders who often walked past her door the year before, the guards who were temporarily stationed there, living in the Guandi Temple not far from Sister-in-law Jin's communal courtyard. In the early morning and evening, when the mother and daughter went to and from work, they would always encounter groups of men in gray uniforms, and a series of giggles would follow:</p>
<p>"Big girl, working hard!"</p>
<p>"Come and play when you're free! Blackie."</p>
<p>Xiao Liu's face was indeed a bit dark because the cart was loaded with coal all day, and when she came back from work, her face and hands were like coal balls, simply difficult to wash clean. Sister-in-law Jin watched over Xiao Liu even more carefully than her own mule. In the past two years, this girl had become as strong as an ox, although she was not as good as her father, she could help a lot. Whenever she ate cornbread and drank soy milk, the woman would always stare at Xiao Liu's wild chewing, and at the same time, she would smile with narrowed eyes:</p>
<p>"Eat more, gain strength and do more work!"</p>
<p>What the woman worried about was that the mule was old, and although the feed was saved, the work was far worse. Sometimes, when the coal was a little heavy, it walked like it was crawling, and even if the whip was lashed down, it would endure it, but it could never lift its feet. The number of trips back and forth every day was getting less and less. Because of this, the wages received were less.</p>
<p>Her hopes were on her daughter!</p>
<p>When those squad leaders sneaked out for a visit during meal times, the woman always told Xiao Liu not to pay attention, but the girl didn't care and grinned, ignoring her mother's secret anger, and gradually a shadow of a gray uniform with a belt hung in her heart. The shadow kept swaying in front of her:</p>
<p>"Xiao Liu, be brave and go!"</p>
<p>The nineteen-year-old girl slipped away on a cold spring night, just when that team of guards was also transferred away. Sister-in-law Jin's pit was empty. Her daughter was so heartless, not leaving a single word. Only in her dreams did she see Xiao Liu as a platoon leader's wife, her face painted with white powder, replacing the black coal dust. When she woke up, she would scold "a shameless girl."</p>
<p>But when Sister-in-law Jin drove the slow-moving cart through the dust, she would sigh again, hoping that her daughter, who had become a platoon leader's wife, would come to pick up her mother.</p>
<p>The mule's hooves tapped the ground, knocking on the woman's memory, but Xiao Liu remained silent.</p>
<h3>The Maiden Fieser (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>Originally, those friends were all people she encountered daily. Jun Man was someone she had grown up with since childhood. Jun Man was older than Fieser and also slightly more knowledgeable. Moreover, Jun Man had participated in (women's movements. So at Jun Man's place, Fieser often heard) terms related to revolution, brand-new nouns, and various current affairs issues. At first, she didn't understand much, then she understood a bit, and finally, she realized that Jun Man often said those things to her simply to exaggerate her own character, conceal her own decaying soul, and also use them as a means to control her.</p>
<p>Therefore, she developed a dislike for Jun Man's behavior and no longer trusted her.</p>
<p>Finally, the relationship between them could not continue because neither was willing to yield to the other.</p>
<p>After this, Fieser gradually developed an immense curiosity and pursuit for the things they used to pride themselves on. She gradually felt that if a woman wanted to fulfill her mission, raise her status, break free from the constraints and restrictions of men, and obtain women's rights and equal human rights from this unequal social system, then she must strive for that cause. She often thought this way.</p>
<p>Therefore, she tried to get to know people who devoted their lives to this great work. She studied, she received training, and she automatically started working. She washed away all those past young lady-like habits, eradicated incorrect notions, corrected her past frivolous behaviors, and bravely worked hard and endured hardship.</p>
<p>She shattered the pink-colored dream, abandoned her family, husband, and children, and unreservedly and without regret embarked on the difficult and arduous path.</p>
<p>Regarding friends like Jun Man, people like this, she now thought, felt very ashamed, they betrayed their own personality and threw themselves into the embrace of a decadent and degenerate life.</p>
<p>She felt very ashamed and sorry for Jun Man. Why would a woman with a future, who had been baptized with a new education, willingly degenerate? Could it be that revolution is something that involves sacrificing oneself?</p>
<p>Fieser had changed now, different from the Fieser of six years ago. Now she was cold and incisive, thinking carefully about everything. Life had forged her into a strong, beautiful, clear-headed person with quick wit and a courageous spirit.</p>
<p>Now, she no longer desired anything vainly. Work was her lover, freedom was her goal! Heroically carrying out their cause, the cause of the masses. |End|</p>
<h3>Female Students in Various Countries</h3>
<p>— Translated by Cheng Jie</p>
<p>(I) Italy</p>
<p>In Italy, female students are rarely seen in Rome and other cities. This may be because they adhere to Catholicism there, and they usually stay within the boarding schools and rarely go out. Furthermore, they don't have any special attire, so one cannot immediately tell that they are female students.</p>
<p>The current Prime Minister Mussolini is working very hard on education, especially wanting to improve the next generation of citizens, and is paying special attention to girls' schools and elementary schools.</p>
<p>The Italian female education policy adopts the idea of a virtuous mother and good wife. Generally, young women retain feminine gracefulness. They mostly stay at home and rarely go out to work. The concept of family education is quite strong, knowledge seems not very profound, and they don't show scholarly research.</p>
<p>Because they are in a southern country, they are very cheerful and happy. Their complexion is snow-white, and their hair is black (they rarely have short hair), making them look very beautiful. They often sing while working happily.</p>
<p>(II) Germany</p>
<p>The first impression of German women is that they are healthy and beautiful. Whenever Hitler gives speeches in various places, female students often sing praises and parade through the streets. Their attire is simple, with brown short coats on top, somewhat like the uniforms of the Brownshirts, and short skirts of the same color below. They wear black stockings and sneakers. No one uses cosmetics, and everyone thinks it is contemptible for female students to wear makeup.</p>
<p>That place is the number one country for fitness and beauty, and they emphasize physical education and dance from elementary school onwards. In Berlin alone, there are over two hundred schools for physical education, dance, and art dance. Apart from those who specialize in dance, elementary and middle school students, after school, wear thin shirts and run to the sports field to practice.</p>
<p>When going to school every day, they mostly ride bicycles, covering long distances of six or seven li or more than ten li. Poor female students also play zithers on the street (which resemble mandolins) or play the violin to earn tuition fees.</p>
<p>Female students almost never go to dance halls. They are only happiest during Christmas and their own birthdays, when they can dance all night long with their female classmates.</p>
<p>Inside the female dormitory, they can hang photos of their loved ones, and the warden doesn't find it strange. Because they believe that they can handle themselves, even if there is a breakup, their rationality will not lead them to suicide.</p>
<p>(III) Soviet Union</p>
<p>Some say that Soviet women are like bears. At first, it seems like an insult to them, but upon closer thought, it is quite interesting. Having traveled through various representative cities in Western Europe and become accustomed to seeing women decorating their eyes like peacocks, encountering women in the Soviet Union who are mostly engaged in labor, it is not surprising to think of them as bears.</p>
<p>Soviet female students are full of spirit. Going into factories and practice centers, some are still of elementary school age, already carrying practice materials there. Their proud demeanor seems to be saying: (I am a working woman!) The female students seen on the streets simply remind people of Chekhov's (The Cherry Orchard) and the phrase (freedom like the wind). They cut their hair short, wear plain clothes, and wear flat shoes. Everyone rejects high heels as something bourgeois. Female students often walk hand in hand with their boyfriends in the park, but the way they hold hands is not with the woman's arm hanging on the man's wrist, showing her weakness and needing his support; rather, they hold hands, twisting their wrists and holding them tightly together, thus showing their intimacy.</p>
<p>There is not much difference between Soviet female students and female workers. They mostly have experience in factory life. They usually don't smoke or drink. When the warm spring arrives, and the earth revives, the parks and other sports fields in Moscow always have groups of female students, wearing sneakers, mixed among many young men, exercising together. Seeing their lively and beautiful physiques, one feels that this is (the joy of youth). (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Financial Pre-Holiday Gold Market Remains Relatively Stable</h3>
<p>Some Long Positions Are Liquidated</p>
<p>Falling by $1.30</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday presented a sluggish appearance, with limited transactions throughout the morning. Both long and short positions experienced psychological fluctuations. The morning close showed a slight downward trend. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market was stable in London and contracted in the US. London pure gold rose by 2.5 pence. Exchange rates initially contracted but then rose. US cotton rose by 16 points, and US wheat had only minor fluctuations. Stock market indicators rose by one yuan plus, and people's sentiments were relatively stable. Off-market pre-trading opened slightly higher, rising to around $44. After opening, the market was relatively firm, but due to banks offering a large supply, and the anticipation that the HSBC bank's exchange rates for both British and American currencies would remain unchanged, large accounts entered and then exited, rising high and then falling back. After entering, the bank's domestic market was flat and sluggish. The gold market's sentiment also stabilized accordingly. The rise and fall were very narrow, hovering around $4 or so for quite some time. This was because the demand and supply were relatively balanced. With Monday being a holiday, most people were waiting and not willing to act rashly. There were also no special international stimuli to affect the gold market. Although banks offered a large supply, they did not have a strong desire to sell. The market thus presented a peaceful scene. As noon approached, the momentum of long positions selling off could not be sustained. Taking advantage of the situation, the supply of sources suddenly became abundant, and selling became slightly stronger. The morning close was thus weak. After the close, some original goods were used to cover positions, providing some relief. After the merger of the two markets, the market has been continuously weak under the activity of a few sellers, lacking buyers. The December new standard was stable as British gold continued to rise. The central bank's customs gold exchange rate also rose. The market situation was very stable, with extremely few transactions. Finally, it also became weak along with the wavering sentiment of the November period. There was a lack of relevant special telegrams throughout the morning. Although there were some, such as the saying that the US silver expert Rogers reported to the finance minister, it had already lost its timeliness, and there was no connection to the news of new labor unrest in the US. Now, I will record the market situation for the morning:</p>
<p>The morning opening was $943.40, a slight increase of one corner compared to the previous close. The exchange market opened with the latest price of British exchange at 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 1875, and American exchange at $35.75. Qingyu and Fuchang advanced to $4.40. Fuyu and Yuanxing sold at $3.90. Yuanmaoyong, Hengyu, Fuchang, Dadesheng, Dafayong, and Yuqingyong suddenly entered, and rose again to $4.50. WahBi sold September US dollars at $0.75, and Citibank sold December at $0.875. Hengyu, Fuchang, Yuanxing, Dekang, and Wanxing sold receipts. Anticipating that the HSBC listing would suddenly move, it retreated to $3.10. People's sentiments remained calm. There were not many transactions in the market. Zhaofengchang, Dadesheng, Daxingyong, and Yuanchangyong bought receipts at the low, rising to $4.00. The exchange market was calm and fluctuated. Finally, because Fuchang limited its trading volume and sold heavily, it was difficult to rise. HSBC sold October shillings at 1875. Xingye offered February US dollars at $36. Fuan and Yuanxing sold slightly, falling to $3.30. Hengyu, Dadesheng, and Yuankangxiang and others successively purchased receipts, and were able to rise back to $4.20. The Great Britain and Mai Jia Li offered December US dollars at $0.875. The situation remained stable. Ruikang and Shunmao sold off, and slightly decreased. Then Fuyu, Shenkang, Daxingyong, and Fuchang sold one after another. Dadesheng and Yuanmaoyong entered and then exited. Speculator Yang took the opportunity to sell off, and then fell to $1.70. Yisheng bought receipts at the low. The close was $942. After the close, Yuanxing and others sold slightly. Due to the close of the border, panic arose in long positions, and it once retreated to within $1.00. Finally, it was around $1.00. The highest price during the morning was $944.50, and the lowest price was $941.70, a difference of $2.80. As a result, it fell by a small amount of $1.30 compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The December new standard opened higher at $943.40, an increase of seven jiao compared to the previous close. The situation was cold, with limited transactions, because the November period also lacked changes. Both long and short positions lacked interest. It was not until after 11 o'clock that Fuyu sold 21 receipts to Yiyu at $3.20. After entering, there were still few buyers. The closing was decreased again to $942.40. The highest price during the morning was $943.40, and the lowest price was $942.40, with only a difference of $1. The result fell by three jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price for the November period was $35.375 because the HSBC Bank's American listing did not move, for a combined standard gold price of $978. Based on the closing price, it was approximately $36 yuan, more than one yuan more than the previous close. The December new standard had the Central Bank's customs gold listing rise to 1.918, approximately combined with a standard gold price of $974. Based on the closing price, it was approximately $32 yuan, more than two yuan more than the previous close. The registered price for October was $942, the same price for November, and the same price for December. The morning supplemental water was $942. The price of red gold was still calculated at an additional $10.05. There were no formal transactions in the market. The selling price of Tianjin goods spot number homes was calculated at an additional $13, and the buying price was calculated at an additional $11.50, and there were no transactions. Only Dong goods had a few transactions, calculated at an additional $10 and change. The Central Bank opened cash, and the appetite was very sluggish.</p>

<h3>Pre-Holiday Savings Increase, Foreign Exchange Falls Within One Corner of the Border</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market price has often stood outside of one corner of the border in recent days, but yesterday morning it suddenly fell within the border, only remaining at eight cents, a huge drop of five cents compared to the previous few days. The situation was quite shocking. However, the actual situation was mostly due to the fact that various industries had more income funds during the Mid-Autumn Festival, which were all transferred to the financial sector for storage. The accumulation into numbers was still quite alarming, so it was appropriate that the discount price was small. There was also no increase in water for the transfer of head, and the transaction of white transfers and discount tickets was over 3.1 million in the morning session, with new transactions over 300,000. The trading volume in the noon market was over 400,000. The trading volume in the small general meeting was over 300,000. The trading volume for foreign exchange mortgages was over 600,000 for redemption and over 800,000 for new loans. The banknote recovered over 500,000 and issued over 700,000. The source of customers was 300,000 and the withdrawal was 150,000. Banks received and transferred foreign bank collection and transfer of bills totaling over 2 million, various goods and foreign exchange mortgages totaling over 2.89 million, telegraphic transfer funds over 400,000, foreign exchange settlement funds over 800,000, and warehousing 400,000. Chinese banks received and transferred bills totaling over 1.78 million, various goods and foreign exchange taxes totaling over 3.45 million, foreign exchange settlement funds over 700,000, and warehousing 300,000. Japanese banks received and transferred bills totaling over 1.7 million, various miscellaneous funds totaling over 3.3 million, foreign exchange settlement funds over 500,000, and warehousing 200,000. Money shops and foreign public units received and transferred over 38 million, foreign transfer funds over 4.1 million, various foreign exchange funds over 600,000, and cash transfers 50,000.</p>
<p>Also, the total number of exchanges at the bill exchange on the 22nd in the city was 8,571,449.31 silver dollars. The breakdown includes 3,773,017.2 silver dollars and 4,798,432.11 silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Copper Coin Plummeted Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Jiangsu small foreign coins were still 824 yuan in the morning market, which seemed to be one yuan less than the previous day, and in the afternoon market, they continued to fall by four yuan, to 820 yuan. As a result, the two markets together decreased by five yuan. Made out transactions, 6,000 corners in the morning market, 5,000 corners in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were 746 yuan in the morning market, and rose by 1.2 yuan in the afternoon market. Made out transactions, 140,000 corners in the morning market, 90,000 corners in the morning market. Copper coins decreased by 4,000, to 317,000. Transactions were 29,799,000, equivalent to 9,400 silver dollars, it is said.</p>
<h3>Bond Market in Securities Long and Short Swap</h3>
<p>Market prices fluctuate constantly... quite inconsistent</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Business Securities Exchange was the last day of futures for this month. Although there was mutual exploitation between long and short positions in the market, it was still very peaceful. Because the two sides had different choices, the market price had a deformed state of being high and low. From the overall observation, the rolling of long positions was still more common. Each board had long positions rolling, and the distant period was much higher than the near period. Although the foreign exchange discount decreased by five cents, the rising trend was just a flash in the pan and soon declined. At the moment, most of the long positions have been rolled into the October period, and they will inevitably be released in the future. Although the environmental situation has not changed, most people's hearts have not been revitalized, and the future cannot be viewed optimistically. The passage of yesterday's opening rose by one jiao to four and a half jiao. This was because the foreign exchange discount was only eight cents, which caused short positions to cover their positions. Helplessly, the long positions were crowded, and the second board immediately fell back, decreasing sharply by two jiao to four jiao. The trading volume in the two boards in the afternoon was not enthusiastic, and the swap trades were not lonely. Market prices fluctuated constantly and were completely inconsistent. This is a common phenomenon when the delivery is approaching. The market price results were both up and down, ranging from five jiao to one jiao to three or four jiao. The total number of transactions was over 20 million yuan. The comparison of the results of the rises and falls is listed on the left (unit: yuan)</p>

<h3>New York Industrial Stocks Rise the Most</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that the New York stock market was quite strong yesterday (21st). This was because President Roosevelt warned textile workers to return to work, and the transportation official Eastman spoke, saying that for the sake of various transportation businesses, the bus industry must be controlled by the federal government. Railway stocks were also firm due to Eastman's speech in Cleveland. Small exchange stocks also rose. The bond market was firm, but US government bonds loosened. Chicago wheat rose due to the strength of coarse grains. The total daily transaction volume was 710,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>The Rise and Fall of Yarn Prices Like a Swift Falcon</h3>
<p>When there is buying, there is also selling.</p>
<p>Ultimately, prices still rise.</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market saw American cotton rebound and raw cotton prices increase, boosting confidence. Speculators covered their positions. Furthermore, with the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, most expected spot yarn transactions to improve after the holiday. Therefore, there were more buyers. In the afternoon, it was reported that near-month prices for Toyo Sampin yarn rose by 2.5 yuan, and distant-month prices rose by more than 3 yuan. However, trade among various parties was sluggish, causing dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>At the opening of the yarn auction, American cotton rebounded, and market sentiment had already tightened the previous day. Reports indicated severe wind damage in Japan. Some nervous individuals claimed that Osaka yarn mills were affected by the typhoon and had to shut down. With this good news, buyers seized the opportunity to be active. Sellers in the market were helpless. Prices for all months rose by 8-9 jiao. After two or three rounds of bidding, the market suddenly softened. The high prices triggered some selling, causing the market to fall again. As a result, prices only rose by 3, 4, 5, and 7 jiao for each month. In the afternoon, it was reported that Toyo Sampin yarn auctions opened with a rise of 2-3 yuan. Shenchang, representing Wang, bid for over 2,000 bales, with prices rising by 4-5 jiao for each month. After two or three rounds of bidding, foreign firms sold off, causing a further drop of 1-2 jiao. As a result, prices for each month rose again by 3-4 jiao. Total transactions for the day were 50,600 bales. According to reports, Tongji bought 800 bales, Dafu 1,000 bales, Hengyi 800 bales, Huikang 1,850 bales, Gengfeng 850 bales, Renfeng 550 bales, Yuanda 1,600 bales, Changfeng 1,300 bales, Xiesheng 2,200 bales, Dafeng 900 bales, Xinchang 700 bales, and Junchang 800 bales.

<h3>### Strong Speculative Interest in Cotton Auctions</h3>
<p>Spot Cotton Sales Rather Sluggish</p>
<p>The cotton market strengthened as American and Indian cotton markets rebounded, and confidence grew. Furthermore, Wang continued to bid for near-term contracts, absorbing a significant volume, leaving the market relatively dry. Therefore, the market was particularly tight. However, name-brand factories showed no interest in spot cotton, and Japanese firms were also inactive.</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton auction, prices rose following foreign cotton, and the situation remained tight. A certain cotton company continued to increase its purchases of October contracts, further tightening the market. Prices for all months rose by 0.05 to 0.15-0.2 yuan. In the afternoon, news that Dongmian Sampin cotton prices had risen intensified buying interest, and prices rose another 0.15-0.3 yuan for each month. However, spot cotton sales were rather sluggish. Total transactions for the day were 136,300 dan. According to reports, Dafeng sold 5,400 dan, Junchang 1,200 dan, Tongfu 4,300 dan, Yuanda 4,005 dan, Ruida 1,900 dan, Shenji 4,800 dan, Renfeng 2,000 dan, Yuantai 1,500 dan, Taichang 1,700 dan, Xiesheng 2,300 dan, Chongan 1,700 dan, Hongchang 2,100 dan, and Yifeng 3,100 dan. Shenchang bought 15,200 dan, Jinchang 1,500 dan, Xiesheng 1,800 dan, Junchang 2,300 dan, Suilong 1,300 dan, Runkang 2,600 dan, Xincheng 7,100 dan, Changhe 10,500 dan, Shenji 3,500 dan, and Yuanda 2,100 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Auction: Highest Price, Lowest Price, Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Balance</p>
<p>October: 54.53, 54.00, 54.35, Up 0.40, 129,000</p>
<p>November: 53.50, 54.05, 54.50, Up 0.40, 217,900</p>

<p>February: 54.85, 54.60, 54.80, Up 0.35, 152,800</p>
<p>Total: 970,800</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales remained sluggish. However, Indian cotton saw another 700 bales traded. Shipments included 1,975 bales of Yao cotton and 1,232 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Lanren bought 700 pieces of Hua at 37.00 yuan and delivered them to the Yong'an factory.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Markets Are Consistently Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was firm and active. Initially, it was firm due to good cloth market conditions and large-scale purchases. Later, it was due to some profit-taking in the South. As a result, spot prices rose by 15 points, and futures prices rose by 9-16 points. British cotton futures rose by 6-7 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to long liquidation and short selling. Later, it rebounded due to purchases by European exporters and a few speculators. As a result, Pingguoer rose by 1.75 rupees, and Aomula and Bailuoxi rose by 1.5 rupees. Original telegram record (dated 21st).</p>

<h3>American Cotton Hoarders Maintain a Firm Stance</h3>
<p>A New York telegram dated September 21 reported on the cotton market situation for the week. At the beginning of the week, raw cotton prices were weak due to long liquidation and Southern profit-taking. Demand was scarce except for occasional rallies. Labor strikes in the textile industry prevented cotton mills from buying spot cotton immediately, limiting industry players to using old low prices for settling futures contracts, and keeping the cotton market quiet. Some cotton mills in the South have now reopened, but the situation of labor strikes in New England is becoming increasingly serious. The cotton market later stabilized slightly because President Roosevelt met with the mediation council and Secretary of Labor Perkins, giving hope for a resolution to the textile industry dispute. Estimates suggest that cotton production may be less than the amount calculated in the Bankhead Act. Therefore, there is a growing call during this cotton season not to implement the donation provisions of this Act. The Secretary of Agriculture convened a meeting of Southern senators on September 22 to discuss this issue, as the matter is legally complex. The attitude of Southern hoarders has generally not changed. Selling pressure in the cotton market is not expected to increase, as they are supported by loans at 12.5 cents.</p>

<h3>Grain and Flour Prices Fall and Then Rise</h3>
<p>Market prices fluctuate, causing hoarders to cover positions.</p>
<p>Heavy short covering leads to price increases.</p>
<p>Flour prices fluctuated yesterday, with both markets showing instability throughout the morning. After opening flat, foreign wheat continued to decline, following the previous day's downward trend. Long positions were eager to close, and this month's contracts fell to as low as 2.265 yuan, a sharp drop of 2.5 fen from the previous day's closing price. Other months fell by 1.75 to less than 1 fen. The price drop attracted interest from customers and hoarders, who covered their positions. Hedgers bought back distant months and mills covered near months, causing prices for all months to rise. At the midday close, prices were up 3-4 fen for all months. In the afternoon, mills did not cover many near-term positions, and hoarders sold aggressively, causing prices to fall again. Distant-term contracts saw little selling from mills, while the short covering by hedgers was strong, creating a situation of near-term weakness and distant-term strength. Closing prices were up 0.75 for this month, 1.75 for next month, 3 fen for November and December, 3.25 for January, and 4.25 for February.</p>
<p>Wheat: After the market opened yesterday morning, prices for all months fell sharply, with near-term contracts declining in unison, falling by 3-4 fen to 6-7 fen. Foreign wheat continued to decline, causing widespread nervousness. Long positions were liquidated, and short positions were increased. Subsequently, flour prices were reported to be rising, and factories also offered spot wheat, triggering short covering. Brokers also observed and did not sell. After the afternoon opening, prices for all months rose uniformly, recovering 3-5 fen to 8-9 fen. At the final close, prices for this month and December were up 2 fen, October up 4 fen, November up 5 fen, December up 1 fen, and February up 3 fen. Trading in spot wheat was slow on both sides, and factories offered only limited amounts. The market stabilized. 1,500 bags of Shandong wheat were offered at 3.55 yuan and were purchased by the Fuxin and Fufeng factories.</p>
<h3>New Early Rice from Tongli Appears on the Market</h3>
<p>Price opens at 11.20 yuan... Market closed today.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various groups were still only about a dozen (nearly 2,000 shi in total). The sales market seemed to be at a standstill due to the approach of the festival. However, sellers had no intention of selling urgently, so the market situation remained flat. The prices of thick, thin, broken, and hulled rice did not fluctuate much. There was also no price difference between new early rice and new pointed rice. However, new early rice from Tongli had appeared on the market. The quality was still high, and the price opened at 11.20 yuan. The exchange rate continued to show signs of weakening. It was also heard that the rice market would be closed for one day today due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about 16-17 sources of new and old rice from various roads downstream. The appetite for all kinds of rice on the market was flat. However, the arrival of East and West new early rice and new Yangjiandujian was scarce, so there was still some retail demand. The market price of white broken rice was high and stable, while the medium and lower grades were slightly soft. The price of thin rice was high, while the medium and lower grades were flat. The price of Baiyuan and new and old passenger pointed rice did not fluctuate. The price of East and West new early rice and new Yangdujian was strong. The market will be closed today, the Mid-Autumn Festival on the lunar calendar, for a day of rest.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Machine Rice Falls by 0.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Anticipated Foreign Rice Rises by 0.02-0.03 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, because the Mid-Autumn Festival was approaching, customers had less appetite for foreign Indica rice, and there was only a slight demand for Wenzhou machine rice inland. There was also little demand on the local streets. The arrival of various kinds of foreign Indica rice was weak, and it was difficult to increase prices. However, large merchants and customers were optimistic about the post-holiday market and were unwilling to sell. However, a new batch of Wenzhou machine rice arrived yesterday. The owner intended to sell it quickly. The previous opening price of 8.85 yuan was only 8.65 yuan yesterday, and the slightly lower price was as low as 8.56-8.57 yuan. The price suddenly fell by as much as 0.2 yuan. The lower price attracted inquiries from local streets and inland areas. Therefore, 1,850 bags were offered. The prices of Zhangzhou machine brown rice and polished rice had already started to rise, but they were dragged down by Wenzhou rice and also stabilized. Hoarders of anticipated foreign wheat maintained their positions, and prices rose by 0.02-0.03 yuan. A total of 600 tons were offered. The current opening prices of foreign rice, Zhu rice, and various rice from Ting, Xiang, and Hanzhou were 1,514 bags.</p>
<h3>New Beans from the Jinpu Railway Arrive Continuously</h3>
<p>New Peanuts from Yantai Open at 7 Yuan</p>
<p>After the Wanzai beans were put on the market, new beans from Pixian along the Jinpu Railway arrived yesterday, totaling 50 bags. The price opened at 3.25 yuan, and the quality was good. It is inevitable that new products are soft, and the harvest is 70-80%. Fifteen bags of new peanuts from Yantai were transported, and the price opened at 7 yuan. However, this was a small amount, so it is difficult to use it as a standard. Yesterday, the market conditions for new and old soybeans were flat, and transactions were not numerous due to the approach of the Mid-Autumn Festival. A train of Zhengyangguan beans, a train of Yingzhou beans, a train of Linhuaiguan beans, 400 bags of Chengmen beans, 200 bags of Liufangchi beans, and 100 bags of early yellow beans were offered. The market situation did not change much. The destination was local streets and the Ningbo group.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: British and American Silk Sales Still Stagnant</h3>
<p>British Silk Prices Rise and Fall Back: Prices of British market wild raw silk mainly fluctuate along with Japanese silk. However, since autumn began, although Japanese silk prices have gradually fallen, wild raw silk prices have remained stable. On Monday this week, Yokohama Japanese silk prices suddenly rose by more than ten yen, and British white raw silk prices also rose sharply. The B grade Wushipai opened at 5 shillings and 3 pence, an increase of three pence. The exchange rate increased by fifteen or sixteen yuan per bale. Unexpectedly, on Friday, Japanese silk prices fell again, and wild silk prices fell back to 5 shillings. However, the A grade Xiu Lin Feima brand price remained unchanged at 5 shillings and 6 pence.</p>
<p>Overseas Raw Silk Prices Are Not High: Labor strikes in the American textile industry are not serious, and textile workers are likely to benefit and not join them. Raw silk prices are gradually increasing. Lyons silk prices have not changed. Although there was a telegram about trading white factory silk yesterday morning, the prices were not high, and the factories still had to lose money, making smooth transactions difficult. Yesterday, only Feng and others purchased 50 bales of white factory silk, and prices remained firm.</p>
<h3>Autumn Silkworms in Zhejiang Province Are All Poor</h3>
<p>The Autumn Cocoon Harvest in Yuhang Is Unpromising: Farmers in various towns and villages in Yuhang have greatly reduced autumn silkworm rearing this year due to drought and withered mulberry trees. Although late silkworms are more common than early ones, statistics show that the amount of rearing is less than 60% of the spring silkworms. After the early silkworms entered the major sleep stage, they suffered from continuous rain for ten days, as well as sultry heat and sudden cooling. The silkworms suffered from diarrhea. The late silkworms were also affected in the third sleep stage, resulting in significant losses. Early cocoons have already been seen, and a good harvest is unlikely.</p>
<p>Early Silkworms in Wuxing Are Spinning Cocoons: The amount of autumn silkworm rearing in Wuxing and the surrounding areas is almost exhausted. In addition, the weather is abnormal, with autumn following summer, and the temperature is irregular, causing early silkworms in the major sleep stage to develop jaundice and die, and late silkworms in the third sleep stage to experience sluggish leaf eating and insomnia. The current situation is not good. Early silkworms have already started to spin cocoons, and silkworm farmers are pessimistic.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market Is Becoming Increasingly Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market among foreign firms in this port became increasingly quiet. There were no transactions for Zhenmei, Gongxi, Zhucha, and other items from Tunkou, Xichun, and other areas. Only two firms in the city, Xiehe and Tianxiang, bought more than 200 boxes of needle-layered green tea. The selling price of upper and middle grade goods was 30 to 41 yuan, and the selling price of lower grade goods was 14 to 16 yuan, with no increase or decrease compared to before. In addition, a large quantity of Qining Huaxiang black tea was also purchased, and the negotiated price is still under discussion.</p>
<h3>Light-Colored Felt Cloth Is Most Suitable for Sales</h3>
<p>Felt cloth has seemed to be sluggish since the last close. Therefore, the new goods arriving this year among the industry players are more than half less than in previous years. Due to the stagnation of sea transportation, felt cloth sales were already weak last year, and this winter may be even worse. The opening price of shoe felt is indeed lower than last year's selling price. However, light colors are quite valuable. Sichuan, Guizhou, Pingjin, and other regions all have a need for this style. The inventory in Shanghai is limited, so those holding the goods set the price based on the color, regardless of the quality of the material. Yesterday, the opening price for Deji Yuanchang camel shoe felt was 5.75 yuan per yard, deep gray was 6.25 yuan, and light color was 6.65 yuan, a difference of 8-9 jiao per yard.</p>
<h3>Metal: The Price of New Lead Wire from the East Rises</h3>
<p>The price of new lead wire from the East rose yesterday because of a telegram from Osaka reporting a price increase. Therefore, the standard in this port also increased by 5-10 fen. It is said that the reason for the price increase is due to the damage caused by the hurricane to the factory, hindering the delivery of goods. Sellers had to raise prices by 1-2 yuan to compensate. The current market prices are recorded as follows (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>No. 10: 8.30 No. 18: 9.70</p>
<p>No. 11: 8.40 No. 19: 9.90</p>
<p>No. 12: 8.50 No. 20: 10.50</p>
<p>No. 13: 8.75 No. 21: 10.90</p>
<p>No. 14: 9.00 No. 22: 11.60</p>
<p>No. 15: 9.35 No. 23: 11.80</p>
<p>No. 16: 9.40 No. 24: 12.20</p>
<p>No. 17: 9.50 No. 25: 12.40</p>
<p>Transactions in this port are strongest in the Yangtze River area. Inland, demand in Fujian and Zhejiang is also quite significant. However, business in the north is scarce.</p>

<h3>The New Life Movement</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuqing</p>
<p>Dear children! Before you eat your dinner and go to bed, you should check whether you have fulfilled your daily lessons and tasks today. In particular, you should reflect on whether you have violated the "New Life Movement" in today's activities.</p>
<p>We should understand that the "New Life Movement" is a movement to correct the standards of national morality. Only with good citizens can there be a healthy country. Since the "New Life Movement" is so important, we certainly cannot ignore it, especially since the rise and fall of the entire country in the future depends on us children!</p>
<p>We roughly know the meaning and effectiveness of the "New Life Movement". Further, we should also know the explanation of the five words "New Life Movement".</p>
<p>"New" means innovation. For example, bad old habits should be immediately eradicated and replaced with perfection (new).</p>
<p>"Life" refers to all our daily interactions with society. Because one's existence cannot be separated from society.</p>
<p>"Movement" means focusing on the central point of a matter and working towards it.</p>
<h3>Franklin's Self-Study</h3>
<p>— Kong Jie</p>
<p>Franklin, an American scientist, was also a talented politician.</p>
<p>His family was very poor. His father was a soap and candle maker. Because he had no money to go to school, he had to help his father insert candle wicks or do chores at home. In his spare time, he read books that he bought at extremely cheap prices.</p>
<p>He first bought many storybooks to read; but he wanted to read more books, so he bought these books, and used the money he could get from buying books to buy many small almanacs.</p>
<p>He also had a method of learning, which was to use his own eyes to see various things. He watched carpenters use planes and saws to work with his father; he also watched tilers put tiles in place; he also watched workers make pots, knives, and other things. He carefully looked at everything.</p>
<p>Because he liked to read, his father sent him to his brother's printing office. There, he found time to read, and he also borrowed books from nearby bookstores and spent most of the night reading, and returned them early the next morning. He also saved his meal money to buy books to read, only eating buns and grapes.</p>
<p>Now, he is a famous person in history. Although he was just an apprentice in a printing shop when he was young, he obtained his knowledge in this way.</p>
<p>He did not waste his time; he read useful books; he saw various things for himself.</p>
<h3>How to Be a Good Student?</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Children, haven't your studies for this semester already started?</p>
<p>(What kind of student do you plan to be this semester?) If your father asks you.</p>
<p>(We like to be good students,) I think you will definitely answer that way.</p>
<p>But how to put it into practice?</p>
<p>(1) Honesty: It means not deceiving yourself. Don't delay today's homework, that's not deceiving yourself. Don't lie to others, and always show others your honesty and sincerity. You must know that (honesty) is the foundation for us to do a great career in the future. How can we not pay attention to it?</p>
<p>(2) Forgiveness: It means forgiving others. Maybe there are unavoidable difficulties in the things that others have done to you, and you should give them a chance to repent, and you must not use revenge immediately.</p>
<p>(3) Love: It means loving mankind and all things, including a very wide range. In the family, love the family; in the school, love the school; also do things in the external society and serve the country, then love the society; love the country.</p>
<p>(4) Respect: That is, respecting parents and teachers, which is also the morality we should have. Why should we respect parents and teachers? Because parents gave birth to us and raised us. Teachers teach us and guide us. And their knowledge and morals are higher than ours.</p>
<p>(5) Mutual assistance: Mutual assistance is the basis of social life, and it is most suitable to practice it in school. Because in our school, academic research and physical training, there is no place where mutual assistance is not needed. When you go to society, you will definitely not suffer if you interact with people in the spirit of mutual assistance. Because you help others, others will also help you.</p>
<h3>Banana Leaf Fan</h3>

<p>Banana leaf fan, fan banana leaves, don't care about the name and don't think about the meaning, its raw material is the palmyra palm, not the banana leaf.</p>
<p>Children! I don't know how many things in the world are not what they seem: I hope everyone can open their eyes and not be deceived by their names!</p>
<h3>Raising Crickets</h3>
<p>— Fan</p>
<p>This year has been so long and hot, it is only now that the autumn wind brings coolness, and a hint of autumn floats into the human world. In this autumn season, there is a pastime that many children probably enjoy, which is raising crickets.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are only rows of Western-style buildings and flat roads, without green grass or tiles. It is, of course, very difficult for us to find crickets. In the countryside, however, these days the clear chirping of crickets echoes from east to west, and can be heard everywhere.</p>
<p>I remember when I was young, autumn came, and I would enthusiastically catch crickets. For the sake of crickets, I was not afraid of poisonous insects. At that time, I knew my cricket-catching skills were not very good because: first, I had to clearly hear the cricket I wanted to catch chirping in the pile of pebbles; second, I had to use agile methods, be patient and careful, and not hurt it, but gently catch it. I often caught crickets with broken antennae or legs, so I often asked others to catch them for me, and I helped from the side. Once caught, of course, we would hold cricket fights, seeing which was strong and which was weak, which was quite interesting.</p>
<p>As I grew older, I felt that letting crickets kill each other, resulting in broken heads and legs, was unbearable. Therefore, after catching them, I would raise them under the water tank in the courtyard, listening to their clear chirping in the evening.</p>
<p>The former is more interesting and easier. Before playing, we first find a few matchsticks, six, seven, or eight will do. After finding the matchsticks, fold them into equal fork shapes as shown in Figure (A). After folding the matchsticks, arrange them according to the shape in Figure (B). After arranging them, put a little water in the center of the arrangement and watch the matchsticks! They will slowly bloom, turning into Figure (C). Do we think it looks like the flowers we draw in art class?</p>
<p>Isn't the scientific toy above very interesting? If we want to know the principle behind this scientific toy, we should ask our science teacher after playing. The teacher will tell us very clearly.</p>

<h3>Scientific Toy</h3>
<p>— Ding He</p>
<p>Now is the world of science, we should find some small scientific toys to play with, to help us develop our interest in studying science. Children, I have a few small scientific toys, all very interesting, I will write them out, let us play together.</p>
<p>The Strange Cup To play this small toy, you only need to prepare a glass and a thin sheet of drawing paper. The method of playing is as follows: fill the glass with half a glass of cold water, cover the mouth of the glass with the drawing paper as shown in Figure (1), cover the paper with your left palm, turn the glass over, as shown in Figure (2), hold the bottom of the glass with your right hand, gently release your left hand, and the drawing paper will be sucked onto the mouth of the glass, and no water will drip out of the glass. If our hand does not shake, then this sheet of drawing paper will not fall until it is rotted by the water, otherwise, it will not fall, and the water in the cup will not drip out. However, when we play, we should pay attention to the size of the drawing paper, it should not be too large, it only needs to be slightly larger than the mouth of the cup.</p>

<h3>What to Do in Autumn?</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>In summer, the sun approaches the earth, and the earth is like a person with a fever, the thermometer is always above one hundred degrees. Children are shouting: (Hot! Hot! ... Annoying summer, nothing can be done!)</p>
<p>With great difficulty, summer is over, and the heat on earth has subsided; workers are stepping up production, farmers are preparing for the harvest, ... all work is restored to its original state. The children no longer shout (hot), but now I want to ask the children: (What are you planning to do in autumn?)</p>
<p>Tie a swing under the tree to swing on, catch a few crickets in the grass to fight, or ask your parents for money to buy roasted chestnuts to eat, ... If the children answer that they do these things in autumn, then I must object: because that is wasting precious time on useless games. Therefore, I know that all smart children know that in autumn they must work hard on their homework, work hard on their studies, and prepare to become a useful person.</p>
<p>The older brother of autumn (summer) has a fiery temperament, the younger brother of autumn (winter) has a calm face, neither of them can please us; only the gentle autumn is our good partner, we must not fail his kindness, and let us hold his hand tightly and move forward.</p>

<h3>The Paradox of the Mid-Autumn Bright Moon</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>It has always been said that on the night of the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, the light of the moon is especially clear compared to the full moon at any other time of the year. Therefore, the world calls it the Mid-Autumn Bright Moon, and the ancients also wrote many poems about admiring the moon. However, why is the moon on the Mid-Autumn Festival not truly exceptionally bright? This is a big question. Now, I will explain the reason for moonlight: when we look up at the sky at night, there are countless beautiful stars like gold and silver dust, scattered in the air. Among these many stars, there are so-called fixed stars, wandering stars, and satellites, etc. The sun is originally one of the fixed stars, emitting light from itself, and the sun also produces many small stars, which are called wandering stars. Wandering stars revolve around the sun in a normal amount of time. The Earth is one of the wandering stars, as are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These wandering stars all receive light from the sun. Around these wandering stars, there are also so-called satellites, which also revolve in a certain amount of time. The moon is the Earth's satellite, but the distance between the moon and the Earth is relatively close, with a distance of 384,395 kilometers. At the time of the full moon, it becomes circular, and in the solar system's satellites, compared with the largest Earth, it looks like brothers. According to scholars' calculations, the diameter of the moon is about one-quarter of the Earth's, the surface area is about three-tenths, and the volume is about one-fiftieth. The moon reflects sunlight and turns yellow. When it is full moon, it has 0.24 meters of candlepower. When it is half-moon, the area of light is half of that of a full moon, but the intensity of light is only one-ninth of that of a full moon. The moon revolves around the Earth, and the moon's own rotation time is exactly the same, 27 and one-third days. The dark areas on the moon are called seas, but the seas on the moon have no water, referring to low-lying areas. The highest volcano on the moon is 8,800 meters high, called Mount Crocius, followed by the Newton Mountains, reaching 7,264 meters. There are many other mountains of 5,000 meters, so the black and white shadows we look up at on the moon are different. The high parts are white, and the low parts are black. And because the moon's own rotation never stops, the shapes and shadows seen every night are different. In this way, the moon is bright because it reflects sunlight, and because of the Earth's obstruction, there is a difference between the full moon and the waning moon. As for the sunlight received, there is no difference, then, of course, the moon itself is not brighter on the night of the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month in a year. However, it has always been said that the night of the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month is the Mid-Autumn Bright Moon. Why is this so? This is because in autumn, the climate is cool, the air is thinner, and after we have passed through the hot summer, we feel more comfortable in spirit on autumn nights, so we have an interest in admiring the moon on the Mid-Autumn Festival. In fact, every month when it is full moon night, how can the moonlight not be bright? The moon on Mid-Autumn Night is not necessarily brighter than the moon on other nights.</p>

<h3>Do We Need to Study on Our Own?</h3>
<p>— Public Servant</p>
<p>If we are apprentices in a shop, should we study on our own? Some people may think that this is not even a question, because since you are an apprentice, the shop has its own regulations about what you need to learn, so there is no need for you to seek your own troubles, nor are you allowed to seek your own troubles.</p>
<p>This is indeed the real situation, but precisely because of this, a problem arises. People are always selfish, and the boss always hopes that the shop assistant can work twelve hours without any pay, while the shop assistant also hopes to be able to get paid without doing anything. Of course, these can only be said to be everyone's fantasies. What should be understood most is that people often neglect or even forget the interests of others because of their own interests. This is not only limited to the relationship between the boss and the shop assistant, but also to the relationship between father and son. If we eat other people's food and are controlled by others, and still don't plan for ourselves, after a long time, you will forget yourself, lose your own existence, and the result will inevitably be the opposite of what you originally hoped for.</p>
<p>This is naturally not to say that everything the shop requires us to learn is not what we should learn. Since we want to be apprentices, we also hope to have some success in business. For example, if the boss tells us: (You should work hard on writing and arithmetic.) Undoubtedly, we should listen to him, we want to be merchants, what else should we learn if not writing and arithmetic?</p>
<p>However, apart from that, if we happen to flip through a newspaper, the boss will glare at us. Is reading the newspaper beneficial to us? It is very beneficial! But the boss also has his own reasons to interfere: he is afraid of distracting our minds and wasting our time. In this way, even if the boss means well, he cannot help but hinder our progress and limit the growth of our knowledge. If we hope to become a complete merchant, the question of self-study inevitably becomes a very important question.</p>
<p>People cannot live in isolation, and a merchant cannot succeed simply by guarding his old shop. We cannot be apprentices forever, and there will be a day when our work of wiping tables and pouring spittoons is over. We will eventually enter society; once we enter society, we cannot simply use the abacus to solve everything. We need to deal with people and deal with the environment. Therefore, in terms of knowledge, we must constantly prepare ourselves.</p>
<p>Looking at the near future, we see that shop assistants are often fired by the boss. Are those fired assistants fired because their writing and arithmetic are not good? No, we see that the shop is always posting large discount advertisements. Is the large discount willingly losing money in order to give others a bargain? No!</p>
<p>Looking at the distant future, after the September 18th Incident, the ruthless gunfire not only destroyed many tangible shops but also affected the decline of the entire business world. The continuous closure of shops and the continuous closure of factories all seem to have a direct relationship with that. So, what kind of relationship is this?</p>
<p>All of this seems to be a very big problem, which apprentices should not know, but if we are not apprentices for life, this knowledge is indeed knowledge that a modern merchant must have. If you do not have this knowledge, you do not need to fight for survival in the business world, you can only wipe tables and pour spittoons all your life.</p>
<p>However, this is not something that the boss can tell you, nor is it something that can be calculated on the abacus. What is needed here is only your own arduous study.</p>
<p>Industry Survey</p>
<h3>Incense Shops</h3>
<p>— Long You</p>
<p>Regarding incense shops in Shanghai, the first thing to mention is their distribution and different scales. Speaking of this, I cannot help but marvel at the astonishing degree of superstition among the general residents of Shanghai. As a source of wasteful spending due to their superstition, there are a total of one hundred fifty to sixty incense shops of various sizes in Shanghai. The number of these incense shops in the Chinese areas far exceeds the number in the concessions; this is because the rent in the concessions is expensive, and most incense shop owners do not want to add this extra expense to their calculations, and are willing to quietly occupy a corner on a remote street in the Chinese areas. There are only a few retail outlets for incense shops in the concessions, and most of their workshops are still located in the Chinese areas, so it is not difficult to find the reason for this.</p>
<p>Speaking of the distribution of incense shops in Shanghai, I want to point out that Zhabei and Nanshi are the places with the most and most densely packed incense shops. Starting from the Xinzhapu Bridge in Zhabei and walking all the way to the end along Datong Road, if you carefully search this road, you will find more than ten incense shops. There are also multiple incense shops dotted along Gonghe Xin Road, Qiujiang Road, Zhongshan Road (Zhabei section), Song Park Road, ... and near the Sun Temple and near the Xin Bridge, with seven or eight or two or three shops each. The situation is the same in Nanshi. It is said that there are eight or nine shops in the small circle within the city alone. In addition, there are many incense shops in Gaochang Temple, Longhua Road, Zhizaoju Road, Xietu Road, Dongjiadu, ... Secondly, Pudong and its location can be considered the second most incense shops. In various places such as Lannidu, Yangjiadu, Tangqiao, Nanmatou, and Yangjing, ... there are seven or eight shops each, or two or three shops each. There are also many incense shops in Caojiadu (around the Wujiaochang area), Zhoujiaqiao, and Beixinjing in the Shanghai West area.</p>
<p>Among the incense shops mentioned above, there are many with sufficient scale and capital, but there are also many that are so simple that it is hard to believe. Most of the largest incense shops have both retail outlets and workshops; most of the workshops are near the suburbs and not far from the retail outlets. The number of people used in the retail outlets of incense shops is not very large; naturally, a common bookkeeper is indispensable, and the rest is saved if possible. Large incense shops may also hire one or two more shop assistants to take care of the retail outlets and package incense, but most incense shops only use the cheap labor of newly graduated apprentices or the unconditional service of apprentices, without hiring anyone else.</p>
<p>There is also a type of incense shop that has to be satisfied with a row of alley houses or a Chinese-style bungalow because they do not have the financial ability to rent a retail outlet. They use this as a base, where they run both retail and wholesale businesses. Needless to say, this is also their workshop. They cannot afford to hire employees, and sometimes they cannot even afford a bookkeeper. Even so, this type of incense shop is not the smallest type of incense shop. The smallest incense shops are mostly neighboring the shanty towns and farmhouses in the near suburbs. They live in low, damp, and simple houses, and they only make two or three loads of incense. Naturally, their products cannot be sold in retail outlets, and they only hope to have a small number of wholesale businesses in nearby small streets and towns. In reality, they cannot be called incense shops, but can only be called incense workshops.</p>
<p>Speaking of incense workshops, it is necessary to mention the workshops of large-scale incense shops here. Generally, most incense shop owners, with a few exceptions, do not care much about the incense-making business. The boss spends more time in the retail outlet and less time in the workshop. However, the workshop is not without someone responsible for directing the work. An "old steward" is the one who controls everything in the workshop. He is mostly an older and experienced character. He must be able to observe the weather and have command ability. Rainy days are not conducive to incense making because the incense cannot be dried. At this time, the old steward must observe the weather on a certain day and decide the amount of incense ingredients to be made. In the process of sifting incense, mixing incense, and making incense, he must also pay attention to the work of each person and give instructions when necessary. He himself also has to engage in work, but what he does is "putting on the bamboo trays" (that is, arranging the wet incense one by one on the incense bamboo trays to take it out to dry) and some of the technical aspects of "putting on the racks," but not the rough work of sifting incense, pressing incense, etc. of "putting on the bottom."</p>
