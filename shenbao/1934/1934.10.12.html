<h3 id="c17">南斯拉夫國王被刺　　恒 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>去今二十年前。奧國皇儲南巡。死於塞爾維亞刺客之手。遂以釀成歐洲之大戰。自大戰而後。此一弱小之塞爾維亞。已與往昔受治奧匈这克羅特斯洛文合併而爲南斯拉夫。不謂二十年後之今日。南斯拉夫之國王。又死於一克羅特人之手。値此國際多事之秋。實令人有「無獨有偶」之感。蓋前一悲劇之發生。以塞人之波赫二省。受治於奧匈。妨碍塞人之大塞爾維亞主義。後一悲劇之發生。則爲克羅特於南斯拉夫三族混合統治之下。不能舒展其獨立行動之結果。故其發生之時與地。雖各不同。然其性質則頗相似也。</p>
<p>唯其性質雖相似。而亦有其不同者在。塞與奧匈。民族逈異。自不甘受治於異族。此其一。塞爾維亞當時之國土雖小。然究爲一獨立國。奧皇儲旣死於塞人之手。則奧自有向塞宣戰之必要。今克羅特則不然。一則並非獨立國家。二則人種上與塞爾維亞人同屬斯拉夫種。至今猶爲南斯拉夫民族中之一族。故今次之悲劇。亦純爲南斯拉夫之内部問題。而其所發生之結果。當與上次之大戰有所不同。</p>
<p>曷言今次之悲劇。爲一南斯拉夫内部之問題。是不難知者。蓋今日之所謂南斯拉夫。雖爲往日塞爾維亞之擴大。而其中之民族。又同屬於斯拉夫系。然以語言風俗宗敎文野之區分。除少數民族不計外。又可分爲三大族。卽塞爾維亞人。約佔七百萬。克羅特人。約佔三百萬。斯洛文人。約佔一百五十萬復加二百五十萬之少數民族。合計有一千四百萬人。塞爾維亞人宗敎上多屬希臘正敎。文字上所用之字母。亦與克羅特異。人文上塞人多屬農民。頗具東方民族色彩。唯克羅特與斯洛文則已久受奧匈統治。人文上工業上皆較塞人爲進步。宗敎上屬天主敎。唯於大戰進行之中。三族共感處境之患難。知非合力團結。組織一共同國家。不足以應付未來之困難。因於一九一七年成立科福公約。遂爲南斯拉夫開國最初之憲章。然三族之中。人數旣以塞人居多。故政治上塞人遂佔優勢。於是處處運用其政治上之勢力。以繼續其戰前之大塞爾維亞之理想。然於克羅特人方面視之。此種政策。實使之退步而日卽東方化之嫌。以是漸覺其當初。與塞合併之非計。一九一九年克羅特人曾一度組織克羅特共和國。雖旋成隨毁。爲時無幾。然分治獨立之運動。曾不稍衰。至一九二三年。克羅特人又有組織國家之企圖。然亦功敗垂成。其後克人於議會之中。雖常力圖爭勝。然收效究屬無幾。及至一九二九年克羅特政治領袖拉迭克被刺之後。南王亞歷山大。復廢除憲法。禁止各黨活動。總攬大權厲行同化克羅特斯洛文各地之政策。遂使克羅特人之分治獨立運動。遭受根本打擊。至一九三一年。亞歷山大頒佈御定憲法。雖設立上下兩院。然上院議員。半數由國王委派。半數民選。下院議員。由政府製就名單。交付民選。以故克羅特人之代表。無論在上下二院。殊難倖勝。此爲克羅特人懹恨亞歷山大之由來。故今茲南王之死。其背景純屬於内部。</p>
<p>唯近頃國際局勢之發展。又足促成此一悲劇之速發耳。蓋克羅特人爲求達其分治獨立計。殊不願見南斯拉夫國際地位之日趨安全。然自今春以來。初則有巴爾幹公約之簽訂。使南斯拉夫在巴爾幹之地位大爲穩定。本年三月與九月問亞歷山大二次訪問布加利亞。又使南布兩國之宿怨。爲之渙然冰釋。最近因法國之居間調解。意大利對南之態度亦將大爲改善。是皆足强固南斯拉夫之統一。而利便塞人之同化政策者也。克羅特人重視南王此次之訪法。且認爲克人今後運命之關鍵。自爲情理中事。故刺客之行動。純出於政治動機。當無可疑。</p>
<p>至於此事在國際局勢上之影響。亦有可得而言者。</p>
<p>（一）據駐在美京華盛頓之若干歐洲外交代表之觀察。克羅特人。或將因是變故而更謀脱離塞爾比亞。或要求高度之自治。結果或將引起國際嚴重之糾紛。蓋大多數意人與克羅特民族之國家主義派。表示同情。而法國則主張克羅特民族應與塞人相團結也。</p>
<p>（二）南王之死。或將影響於未來之倫敦海軍會議。蓋法意恊調。爲海軍會議順利進行之一先决條件。而亞歷山大則素持反對態度。意大利在亞得里亞海之政策。本與南斯拉夫之利益相衝突。戰後齟齬不絶。南斯拉夫與捷克羅馬尼亞三國。卽世人常稱之不恊商國。與法比等國同處凡爾賽統系之下。法人對之且隱然以保護人自居。法人旣欲與意恊調。自亦不得不先行消弭南斯拉夫之反響。以買得各小恊商國之歡心。巴爾都僕僕風塵。奔走於巴爾勒特與羅馬道上。最大之使命卽在於是日前意相墨索里尼在米蘭之演説。已表示願與南人和平轉圜之誠意。而對法關係之接近。尤爲滿意。今南王與巴爾都不幸而同時罹難。法意與南意關係。自不免同時受重大影響。且巴爾幹均勢。旣因是而動搖。地中海局面。亦發生重大之變化。英人對於此事或將特别注意。甚至因監視意人而多造戰艦。未可逆料。英意若各作造艦之競爭法美日三國勢難坐視。結果非與海軍軍縮之主旨背道而馳不止。</p>
<p>（三）意國屢經宣言。决以全力維持奧國之獨立與完整。以阻止維也納政府與德國國社黨相親善。而南斯拉夫則本爲舊日奧匈帝國之一部。因奧國有修正特里亞農和約之運動。深恐一旦成爲事實。將於己國不利。故欲聯德以制奧。並以抗意。本年五月間德政府航空部長兼普魯士總理戈林將軍親訪南京。當衆宣稱南斯拉夫爲巴爾幹半島大國。頗爲奧意二國所不喜。外交界並視戈氏此。行爲德南兩國親交合抗意國對中歐政策之另一證。或非過詞。今南王中道崩殂。皇儲冲齡踐祚。誠能維持國内和平。已屬萬幸恐難賡續其父遺志。聯德以抗意。所可以預料者。據最近法政府之宣言觀之嗣後法國對於南斯拉夫之國是。必將格外注意。如遇危急之秋。當不惜予以實力之援助。且亞歷山大之后爲羅馬尼亞公主。兩國因姻婭及同盟關係。自能守望相助。以維繫此非常之局面而使幼主安於其位。假若南國内亂不起。則表面上之國際糾紛。或不難消弭於無形也。</p>

<p>番民語言、全屬藏語、雖因各地山川、異其聲調、然大致皆不出藏語之一脈、中以拉薩語一種、殊較流行通用、文字因各寺院之喇嘛、悉用番文、（卽藏文）且無學校敎育、鄉間之識字者、均賴入寺誦經而得、故全部文字、純係番文、省縣佈告公文、亦不得不漢番兼用、聞英人在西藏各處、遍立敎堂醫院、附設學校、廣收藏人子弟、灌輸相當科學、並在　印度設立葛達藏人軍事學校、規模宏大、敎授完備、所有講義、槪由英文譯爲番文、而用精通番語者以充敎授、其用意之深且毒、誠令人不寒而傈也、</p>
<p>番民嗜好、無諭男女老少、喇嘛僧侶、無不酷嗜烟酒、烟如鼻烟·旱烟·水烟、都通行各地、紙烟寖亦流行、惟番人所謂之睡烟、（卽鴉片烟）無有吸之者、此誠一大好現象、閒居喝酒、好聽番文三國誌、能唸丨尤能背誦此書者、到處受人歡迎、此外爲社會組織之特殊、靑年男女旣　多得在靑草綠野、任意度其玫瑰色的戀愛生活、所以婉轉淸脆的歌聲、如怨如慕的曲調、煞似花塢春曉、好鳥亂鳴、征人聞之、殊有「於我心有戚戚焉」之感、茲將漢譯情歌選錄數首如次、</p>
<p>（一）貴族們的姑娘、好似仙桃的核兒、但是高樹上　的桃、也有成熟一日的吧、（二）鮮花開過了、蜜蜂不用愁、情綠旣斬斷、又何悲之有、（三）淺水邊的情雁、願長此留連、冰堅湖凍、只好毅然飛向天邊、（四）將美麗的鮮花、拿到佛前供獻、朝夕依依的黄蜂、也飛到别人殿前、（五）無上的佛像、雖堅强地默求憶念、還是不入我的腦際、但、她那嫋嫋的嬌姿、却時時隱約在我的眼前、（六）對你眞誠懇摯的心、若是學佛、此生此體、何愁不得登西天、（深陷情網、末由自㧞者讀之、當惺然澈悟）（七）親愛的人兒然否同我長期作伴她道「除非死别、决不生離」（八）依着她的心理、我又犠牲了佛緣、若毅然入山修道、又違背了她的心願、（戀愛不忘修佛、修佛不忘戀愛這種矛盾現象、豈僅番民靑年爲然）（九）珠實在我家時、不知有這般珍貴、現在失諸人手、纔顯得他的萬能、（十）心坎上的愛人、若得長途相伴、那末脚不履鞋也覺前程快樂、（十一）滿腔愁緒、不足爲外人道怕的仇家歡喜愤愛人傷悼、（十二）由上界降凡、荳花似的愛人呵、不但求此生與你同居、還祝、我倆來世相過、</p>
<p>番民流行格言、習用成語、爲數尤多、茲亦略舉數例如下、（一）我分不給、你分不取、（卽一介不以與人、不以取諸人之意）（二）下了雨、路不好、喝了酒、人不好、（三）聰明人一提便醒好馬一鞭絶塵、（四）衆口没大門、歧路無關門、（卽防口不易、歧途易入之意）（五）祇要吃着鹿肉、就是膘瘦、不可多心、祇要喝着松潘茶（松潘產茶、番人最喜）縱無酥油、不可多心、</p>
<p>靑海番民、因習俗語言文字之不同、又未切實施以特殊政治、及有效敎育、以致嚮來設官治理、國法置若罔聞、而彼等用以範圍强暴行爲之自由法律、又多有與情理未合之處、如甲乙兩部落、若有仇恨甲忽派人襲擊乙、奪取乙之牛羊財物、甲擄人民以待贖、可乙先有準備、擊斃甲所派之人、甲更率衆以圍乙、並派所謂「鄉老」八人、向乙要求賠償人命、乙知理屈且不敵、甘願賠命時、先給擋兵財禮一二百金、或牛馬數埂匹、請甲解圍、後議人命價額、例如九九八十一这罰欵、卽每一人命、應以毛牛·犏牛·羯羊·黄牛·　馬·珷</p>
<p>騍馬·駱駝·驢及騾等各九頭赔償之、倘乙勢力强大、與甲抗爭、互有死傷地、經他部落丙調解、如甲死八人、乙死十人、則甲應向乙賠二命、照例納財禮如上、此外甲乙素無寃仇、忽甲之人民、私向乙搶刦而被殺、亦須照例賠欵、且所賠欵數、非由兇手一人負責、乃由全部人民分担、故番民好搶殺、多爲環境所促成、倘乙部不承認殺人或搶刦、或眞爲寃枉、則另用「烙油鍋「抓斧頭」「滾麫蛋」「賭死咒」等漂渺無稽之方法、以取决於天神、當事人之雙方、無不損財傷身、而以鄉老自居者、（非各千百户王公紅牌紅保之小頭目、卽嫁禍於人之眞正老牌强盜）反得坐收漁人之利、番族格於陋俗惡例、長此自戕元氣、倘不設法革除之、要非戢邊安民之善計也、</p>
<p>番人與蒙人、在我國地理上同爲包圍西北之二大民族、在歷史上、彼京早於數千年前、發生秘切之關係、故兩族生活、極相類同、第一游牧生活、酷信喇嘛敎、卽爲蒙番通性、身掛佛像、家供佛爺、每飯必先唸經、將食物祭獻天地、後始食之、甚焉者、死後將所積財產、舉贈寺院、云請佛爺代爲保管、來生仍得使用、人畜有病、迷信喇嘛經咒、而不求醫服藥、有所喜、則云神之　賜、必思有以酬謝之、有所不欲、則云神之所罰、尤須許願以禳解、不論禳解或酬謝、終歸喇嘛發財、是以寺院日增、喇嘛地位、亦日益提高、坐食安享、徒衆亦日多、反之、日事生產之在俗人、人口因之日益减削、且蒙番靑年、得在山間草地、隨便野合、破身過早、多不生育、亦爲人口减少之一原因、此外迷信「好日」、如每月初一·十三·十五·三十·不殺牛羊、或揀過　好日、而捨壞日、如十九是好日、二十·二十一不好、則捨二十·二十一·而連過三天十九、每日早晚、榨取馬牛羊乳、作飯·牧畜·汲水·磨麵·以及客至之招待、皆萃集妻女之身極爲勞苦、男子除縫衣服外、卽多無正事、又蒙番人民、好探聽消息、路見行人、無論認識與否、亦必慇懃問、偶有所得、必廣爲傳送、故草地發生事件、傳達非常迅速、此皆爲蒙番相同之習俗、</p>
<p>至於蒙番民族性、則殊有不同者在、尤其在靑海境内、兩族互相接觸之人民、初因心性之不同、以致時起生活这衝突、蓋番族性强悍、蒙人較懦弱、番人以搶刦殺掠爲能幹、蒙族則以作强盜爲恥辱、兩族男子、雖皆腰带刀劍、而好騎馬射擊、倘因任何爭執、㧞刀相向、結果大多蒙人趨避、番人逞强不已、又或蒙人被搶於番人、亦多不敢追擊、蓋恐追擊傷人、人但失物難返、且須賠償命價、不如省事爲愈、以故靑海原住蒙族二十九旗、在昔蔓延黄河兩岸、今則番族地面日展、蒙族地面日縮、以至河南蒙族絶蹟、而河北亦漸有不支之勢、雖然、蒙番民情、雖有强弱之分、而其知法不知恩、畏威不懷德、則又爲共同之習性、茲後積極提倡蒙藏敎育、因勢利導、矯其偏激、庶能精誠團結、不致受欺於外人也、</p>

<p>市長報告　行禮如儀後、即由吳市長報告原文如下、各位同志、今天是中華民國廿三年的國慶紀念日、上海市全體公務員、軍警團同志、在此舉行國慶紀念典禮、回顧旣往、俯察現狀、策勵將來、我們心中有無限的感想、中華民國誕生、已有二十三年之久、在這二十三年内、雖有我們全黨同志·全國人民·的努力奮鬥犠牲、尙未能使中國富强、不能使中國安定、而自九一八起、又碰到了空前的大打擊、形成了中國今日自有歷史以來最嚴重的國難、我們考究中國革命爲什麽至今尙未成功、又爲什麽在革命的過程中、會遇到如此重大的打擊、其原因不外下列數點、第一、我們在辛亥革命成功的時候全黨同志、大多以爲革命已告成功、同時　時黨的組織、没有健全、同志對於總理的革命主義、革命方略、没有深切的認識、没有切實的奉行、所以當時革命的同志中有句普通的流言、所謂革命軍與、革命黨消那時革命尙未成功、而那時團體的精神、先已消沉渙散、團結已不堅固力量已不充實、那無疑的革命一定是不能澈底成功的、這是第一個原因、第二、在辛亥革命以前、我們主義的宣傳、没有普及國民、没有澈底了解革命主義、以爲革命運動祇是一個種族革命、是反淸復明的革命、因此辛亥革命的力量、將淸廷推翻以後、全國人民、也都以爲革命已告成功、那時革命黨在如此環境之下、不能不有一種妥恊、就因爲妥恊、就埋伏了二十多年來的禍根、市府檢閲典禮（攝昌啟）</p>
<p>這個禍根、我們雖然不敢説可以使中國滅亡、但是這種禍根、實足以使中國在世界猛進的洪流中落後了五六十年、這禍根是什麽、就是革命政府的北　、選舉袁世凱做大總統、引起袁世凱·徐世昌·馮國璋·曹錕·等軍閥當政、施用不正當的權力來賣國、祇圖自私自利、中國就因此禍根、在二十多年來、半年一小戰、一年一大單、内戰不息、因爲這個禍根、共和政體、曾幾度發生動搖、故有張動復辟、袁世凱稱帝、因此種種原因、就使中國的政治與社會、發生嚴重、而空前的動亂、而中國的國勢、也日趨衰落、我們今日的國難、其原因、雖甚複雜、且係自近百年來、日積月累、種種民族的病態所造成、但是如果在幸亥革命那時、本黨同志、能够澈底的奉行總理的革命主義、革命方略、我們的革命團體、能有如辛亥革命前那様團結堅固、革命同志、又能有辛亥革命前十幾次革命起義拿手槍炸彈拼命犠牲的精神、而繼續努力、我相信、辛亥革命、决不致不澈底、如果辛亥革命能澈底、一定不會有袁世凱、没有袁世凱、就不會有軍閥的跋扈、就不會有張勳的復辟、更不會有二十餘年來連年的内戰、使全國各地均不安定、民不聊生、也不會使國難發生得這様快、也不會使今日國難如此嚴重、如果全黨同志、能够有辛亥年前那種堅强的團結、那種犠牲的精神、全國人民、如果也能澈底了解革命主義、熱誠的擁護革命主義贊助革命運動、就是有了此種國難、我們當然也能够很從容的、很有把握的、去謀應付、二十一年一二八的上海戰爭、我們上海市民不僅是耳聞、尙且是目覩、這一次的戰爭、就給我們一個很大的敎訓、在一二八上海戰事那時、如果全國統一、没有寗粤之分、没有共匪之禍、我們中央政府、當然能够指揮裕如、能使全國上下、一致的來應付一二八戰事、雖然、我們的武器笨舊、我軍當不致僅僅抵抗三十多天、而中華民族所給予世界各國的好印象、當然也更大了、所以各位同志、民國二十三年來、雖經過革命黨和全國人民長時間的努力奮鬥犠牲、不但不能使革命澈底成功、不但不能使全國各地安定、而發生了空前的國難、這我們不能不歸咎於破壞中國統一的人、不能不歸咎於黨内不團結、不能不歸咎於全國人民没有澈底了解革命主義、没有以所有力量貢獻給革命、因此我們在今天中華民國廿三年國慶紀念的時候、我們一方面、應該深深的認識此創痛的歷史的敎訓、同時我對於市民不能不深切致其熱切的期望、第一、要希望上海市民、不但要作、個普遍的有力的宣傳、還要自已先來以身作則、來信仰一個主義、三民主義、使全國人民都信仰三民主義、因爲三民主義、是我們做人救國的一個最高原則、這是第一個希望、第二、希望要維護國家的統一、如有破壞國家統一者、並以我們所有的力量、去對付他、阻止他、以免國家的分裂、第三個希望、要擁一個革命首領、因爲我們在全國不安定狀况、及無所適從的情形之下、祇有擁護一個首領、在一個首領領導之下、共同來作革命運動、共同來作救國運動、信仰一個主義、擁護國家統一、擁護一個首領、這是救亡圖存最必要的條件、也是救亡圖存的一個最有效的方法、我們自民國二十三年來年年都有國慶、年年都紀念國慶但是我們决不應將每年的國慶隨便過去、也决不應使我們每年的國慶、成爲一個無意義的儀式、我們在此國慶紀念當中、應該回顧二十三年革命過程中所受的敎訓、刺激與痛苦、並前瞻今後國民革命和救亡圖存之工作的艱鉅、大家應督責自已、應有一個新的認識、新的精神、和新的勇氣、這種新的認識、精神與勇氣、就是要信仰一個三民主義、維護國家統一、擁護一個革命領袖、來救亡圖存、深望上海市民、在此紀念國慶之日、能够深體此意、以身作則、爲全國倡、並廣爲宜傳、喚起國民、一致行動、這是今天我們紀念國慶所應有的認識、應具的精神、演説畢、即宣告　成、散會、</p>

<p>是屬於個人的、不是屬於宗敎的、慈幼恊會成立了六年工夫、在努力之餘、更進而進行全國聯合、故慈幼恊會成立後、要想慈善界同人、開一個會議、俾各以報告、互換意見、在各方面能多得一點實益使各地慈幼會、得一南針、國家的根基、繫之於人民、所謂大聖大賢大豪傑、仍爲一人、可是與國家社會關係甚大、譬如孟子、若生能爲聖賢、則毌須孟母之敎養、一人動作、可影響國家社會、中國今日的一切、如敎育生產建設各方面都落後、上帝給我們很廣的領土很大的民族、我們應當自已振作、慈幼恊會過去的工作、就是在培養聖賢豪傑及救國的心願、慈幼事業是科學的事業、不但研究、而且要種種的發明、譬如小孩、有時人以爲不可敎、而有人偏能敎化成人、人類的聰明智慧、各有不同、我們若能融之於一爐、是不可能、但我們的通常辦法、在因才施敎、兄弟今日給大家貢獻的、慈幼爲聯合事業、中國各種事業之無成就、即壞於此、大家各自爲政、致影響於國家社會、大家如能聯合起來、敎養各地的兒童、及推進之於兒童的家庭作父母者、如是將來兒童服務社會、能以合作之精神爲國、則吾信中國之强、可拭目以待、故慈幼事業、亦爲救國事業、總理曾説、革命尙未成功、同志仍須努力、更以爲欲達到革命的目的、又説聯合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奮鬥、如自己尙不能聯合、何能聯合世界、今日參加代表、不遠千里而來、甚願以平素優良成績、相互交換意見、將來并切實聯合、推廣中國慈幼事業　　市長歡迎詞　諸位先生、今年全國慈幼恊會領袖會議、在上海舉行、兄弟忝爲地主、得與全國慈幼領袖、共聚一堂甚爲榮幸、貴會成立迄今已有六年之久、貴會今天參加代表、有十幾省之多、可見貴會不特在時開上有相當悠久歷史、且在空聞上、也已有十分廣大的範圍、在過去六年、諸公爲中國社會、中國兒童、所做的　業所成的勞蹟、尤其已經漸漸的引起國民的注意和同情、因此兄弟今天在歡迎諸公的時候、對於諸公以往的努力、應該首先表示深切的敬意、慈幼事業、雖一般人認爲是一種社會事業然而因爲近代國家的演進、已經成爲政府職務的一部、而且戰後新進的國家、對於兒童生活、兒童權利、且予以憲法上的保障、就是有我們中國古代、當政治淸明的時期、也一向是敎養兼施、育　養老、都爲政府當局所重視、孔子説「幼有所長、鰥寡孤獨疾廢者、皆有所養」、孟子説「幼吾幼、以及人之幼」、就是我國向來重視慈幼事業之重要原則、慈幼事業之所经重要、當然用不着兄弟在諸公面前費詞、不過在政治學的原則上、人民爲國家搆成之要素、在社會學以及優生學的原則上、一個民族的强弱、尤基於其國民質素之優劣、所以一個賢明的政治家以及一個有遠見的事業家、莫不注意於其國民之敎養、特别在一個民族復興圖强的過程中、對於這種工作、格外應當努力、古代越王勾踐之所以要十年生聚、十年敎訓、就是爲了這個道理、德國的斐希德（Ｆｉｃｈｔｅ）他更是具體而切實、主張、要復興德國、一定先要從培養國民種子入手、而在歷史的事實上、勾踐的興國、德國的復興、都是這種理論所造成的結果、我們從這一個古今中外歷史的過程中、就很淸楚的認識了慈幼事業、和復興民族的聯繫來、所以兄弟以爲諸公的事業、并不是單純的社會工作、實在又負了一種復興民族的重任、關於這一點、兄弟在去年貴會兒童節的徵文中、以及今年上半年的大會上、已經反覆的説過、今天用不着再來重復、兄弟謹以至誠謹祝中國慈幼事業的發展、謹祝諸公的成功、</p>

<p>許超會計師昨起開始查賬</p>
<p>羣益銀團及分行同時結束</p>
<p>國聞社云、南京路一七二號中國興業銀行、因經理捲逃、周轉不靈、突於昨晨起宣告淸理、其附設之中國羣益銀團、與六處分行、同時停業、錄誌如次、</p>
<p>淸算通告　昨日張鼎律師·代表上海中國羣益銀團·許超會計師代表上海中國興業銀行總分行、發出淸算通告稱、據上開當事人代表到所陳述稱、近因總行經理秦抱元、捲潛逃、事出倉卒、以致周轉不靈、無法維持、於即日起、宣告淸算、委托通告前來、所有各債權人、統希於登報二星期内、持同債權憑證來所登記、逾期認爲抛棄、人欠各户、亦希同一期間、逕交本事務所製給據、逾期即行訴追特此通告、（事務所南京路一七二號二樓、電話九零二四四號）　　該行歷史　該行成立於民國十四年、吳佩孚威鎭湖北時代、由吳氏秘書孫丹林·高恩洪·等所創辦、以張星三爲經理、總行即設於漢口、設分行於上海、凡吳系軍政人物匯欵、湖北省府金庫、吳氏餉需等、均經該行收付、一時營業非常發達、及吳氏下野該行亦被累改組、改由恊理焦樂山升充經理、陸夢薌爲恊理、移總行於上海、漢口總行、則改爲分行、至九一八後、再行改組、但營業日瀕於危險、後由常務董事陸錫侯、組織羣益銀團、投資三十萬元、並以該行自置之房產、南京路興業里房屋、抵押八十餘萬、轉存該行、因此得以支持至今、</p>
<p>分行一斑該行在滬除南京路一七二號總行外、另設分行三處、一設天主堂街卅一號、經理周樹卿、一設南市十六舖東門路八十九號、經理汪冀軒、一設福煦路互一七吨、蘇州分行設觀前街、支行則設臨頓路、松江分行設西門大街、另在海州亦曾有一分和、惟於去年八月間與漢口分行同時結束、該總行重要人員董事吳理華·張淸澄·屠寳彝·季宗隨·周祝封·監察人楊肯堂·陸景星·朱俊卿·常務董事兼總經理項驤·（微塵）常務董事陸錫侯·經理秦抱光·協理陸夢薌、</p>
<p>淸算原因　據銀行界方面稱、中國興業銀行爲有限公司、未加入銀行公會、又未發和鈔幣、雖辦理儲蓄匯兑、但本埠方面所吸收存欵、爲數不多、約十數堣元、此次宣告淸算原因、當然在於營業虧蝕無法維持也、</p>
<p>女工存户　昨日該行倒閉後、因各報亦均在休刊中、故知者甚鮮、直至午後、始有存户趨許會計師處登記、但許查帳甚忙、須待今明方能開始登記、記者午後赴南京路總行時、見一半老婦人、率伴站立行前、據云、在電燈泡廠做工、一生節蓄六百元、曾存該行生息、今不料驟告淸理、言時淚幾奪眶而出、慘哉、</p>
<p>組債權團　聞該銀行債權人方面、業已組織債權團、委請王培源律師爲代理人、其債權人登記處、設於大陸商塲五樓五一四號王律師事務所、</p>

<p>以嗎啡煎水吸入羊毛中公然運滬</p>
<p>從毛上滌除毒質用化學方法提煉</p>
<p>丨若非失火實不易於破獲丨</p>
<p>前日上午十時半、新閘愛文義中一百七十五六七號四層樓巨厦、突然起火、由消防隊救熄後、經該管新閘補房查悉、被焚者乃一極大之製造嗎啡機關、茲將該機關製造嗎啡情形及起火後各節、述之如次、</p>
<p>生活奢華　有蔡璧城者、專以製造嗎啡爲業、家住新閘路一千一百二十四弄（卽沁園村）二十四號門牌、因業此已久、獲利不資、起居異常奢華、自置汽車一輛、其照會爲五七八七號、愛文義路之製造機　設立已有數月、該屋乃新式建築、月需租銀三百兩、蔡以其地點與家毘鄰、易於照顧、遂賃之、</p>
<p>輸毒妙計　其製造嗎啡之方法、則甚新奇、嗎啡原料、咸來自蜀中、惟此爲違禁品、運輸不易、乃先在四川將原料煎水、而後用羊毛吸收其水、迨毛乾則打包運滬、故沿途雖由税關檢查、但以物係羊毛、更無任何氣味、致從未發覺、而此項飽吸毒水之羊毛、運入該製造機關後、則先交給四層樓上之製造嗎啡者、將羊毛復浸於水中、使其所吸之毒質、完全滌除、於是淸水頓變混濁、乃將此項濁水、搬至三層樓、</p>
<p>忽告火警　是樓有精於化學者、卽將此水加以提煉、最後始由砂内提出嗎啡矣、該項原料、成本甚微、及煉就嗎啡乃售高價、前日午前、三樓正在爲化煉工作、因工程師不愼、致使化學藥水與火相觸、遂肇焚如、凡在三樓工作之人、見火勢甚猛、無法撲滅、卽相率逃逸、一面急赴蔡璧城寓報告、蔡料其秘秘、此番必暴露無遺、聞警後、當駕所置汽車、命汽車夫徐來生疾馳逃避、</p>
<p>拘獲二人　是時救火會及新閘捕房均各派員赶赴火塲、皆覺烟火之中、透出異味、初尙疑或有烟土被焚、旋將火澆熄、突見有兩人自四層樓屋頂逃往鄰家、被在塲探長湯堅、探目陸根弟·探員楊有山·等截獲、隨卽入起火屋内查察、審知係一製造嗎啡之機關、其三樓四樓佈置之製造機器、均尙完好、焚餘之原料亦多、據深明嗎啡市况者云、該屋内已製成未製成之嗎啡爲値當不資、</p>
<p>主犯在逃　湯探長等當因屋内物件甚夥、爰將所拘之兩人、带回捕房、詰悉一名龔寳昌、通州人、一名繆章才、安徽籍、皆係在四樓工作者、捕頭飭令收押、並派中西探捕多名、馳往該嗎啡機關監守、一面仍派湯探長等駛赴蔡璧城家查拏主犯、但蔡早已彄車遠颺、於是通知各捕房一體注意、未幾、蔡之汽車忽發現於斜橋路廿一號邱姓之汽車間、蓋邱爲蔡友、蔡駕車逃出家門、經過邱之車間、適邱乘車外出、蔡遂棄車而遁、其車夫乃將車暫置於該處也、</p>
<p>推事履勘　俄而與製造機關鄰近之商務書館工房司閽捕亦拘獲自四樓逃出之通州籍工人龔文富一我、槪於昨晨解送第一特區地方法院、由劉毓桂推事提審、捕房律師張天蔭略述經過情形、並請前往察勘、劉推事訊據龔等三人、均供新近被僱、月薪八元等語、劉推事諭令收押、並定今日午後二時半親往火塲履勘、</p>

<p>東華先負一球</p>
<p>結果二比一勝</p>
<p>東華足球隊北征歸來後、特約活塞斯乘國慶假期作友誼比賽於申圜、東華自得顧尙勷及重歸老家之陳家球後、實力似勝於昔、但陸鍾恩之守門、頗露慌張、馮運佑威風已减、遜於往昔、内衛及前鋒均佳、是日萬象華未出塲、上半時各無所獲、下半時東華因守門阿陸大意失一球後、賴戴麟經李義臣最後之努力、反以二比一勝、是日觀衆十分踴躍、爲新秋足球季第一次盛况、</p>
<p>活塞斯開球先進、東華出意不已、猛撲敵營、前鋒短傳美妙、出師神速、觀衆不覺彩聲齊起、李義臣一頂一射、馮運佑一次遠攻、雖未得利、赢得全塲吃好、敵人滿受虚驚、約十分鐘久、敵軍脱圍而出、前哨從右邊深入、擾東華邊陲、茂林兩次在門前、左衝右突、欲圖攻門而不果、李寗關洵安保守之功也、</p>
<p>敵軍又從右翼側擊、寇蒂斯御枚疾奔、高球送至門前、茂林用頭頂至正前方、阿巧用迅雷不及掩耳之法、亦以頭頂攻門幸而阿陸眼明手快、伸手接住、化險爲夷、球在塲中往回如流星、彼此行動健捷局勢頗見緊張、雙方内衛、均有金湯之固、急切不易攻破、陸鍾恩之守門、則頗示慌張、令人揑一把汗、</p>
<p>陳洪光邊綫擲球、球由家球頭上彈回、洪光一脚遠送敵軍門前、戴麟經因受敵人監視、順勢將球挑高、義臣即奔上頭頂、不幸在横木彈回、秋亭趕上還攻、又被守門先一着撲出、周光中從左方高球踢來、無意間造成極好機會、正從門前落下、又爲赫巴特救出、半小時後、阿巧得左翼之球、衝過東華後防、已至門下、勢在必進、當此千鈞一髮之際、李寗由斜刺裹火速趕上、阻倒阿巧、陸鍾恩偷空抱球而出、得以脱險、</p>
<p>上半時平穩過去、下半時起、雙方陣綫均有更動、東華左翼周光中退出、由曹秋亭免爲其難、右翼之缺、乃以賈幼良庖代、活塞斯右翼寇蒂斯亦改以平庸之力刦士、實力大减戴麟經單槍匹馬、殺進敵營、斜角上攻門甚急、不意正對守門員、乃爲其安穩接住、義臣賣弄槍花、在敵門左盤右盤、意欲偷隙攻門、無如對手監視極嚴、無隙可乘、雙方表演、大不如前、陣容弛懈、没精打彩、</p>
<p>如是牽延久之、忽又奇峯突起、病質奄奄中、忽打一針醒奮劑、活塞斯右翼連發兩次角球、東華　先受一度虚驚、陶樂威中央送球右翼、再還至門前、時東華内衛、陣容忽亂、茂林乘機攻門、球勢軟弱、陸鐘恩跌地抱球、略有遲慢、阿巧奔上將球撥進門内、反失一球、觀者唖然失笑、</p>
<p>否極泰來、禍福無常、東華要不失此一球、恐　不能激發前鋒進取之心、故有此一失、東華遂以二比一反敗爲勝焉、東華中央開球、一鼓而下、不三分鐘、家球接得義臣自邊界發出高球、轉交麟經、戴拉起一脚、對門力射、對手措手不及、球在守門赫巴特身上擦進門中、造成和局、周旋久之、時間約將終了、李義臣孤軍深入、右角斜射、球勢甚急、直射網角、赫巴特欲救不及、遂再負一球、東華乃以二比一勝、陣容如下、</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三回　未解飄零窺門憐少女願聞困苦惜玉訪貧家</p>
<p>這小西天旅館，在西安城裏，旣然是第一個大旅館，當然在這旅館裏，也不斷的有要人來往，同時，也有極不要緊的、人來往。李士廉和賈多才吃飽了走回去，自覺有幾分醉意，有些不得勁，這且走回自己房間裏去，打算先行安睡。當他走進自己院子裏來的時候，見那屋檐下，掛了一盞玻璃罩煤油燈，那玻璃罩子在半空裏搖撼着，同時那昏黄的光，在墻壁上隨着動邊。在那光綫裏面着到三個人，站在院子中間。一個是本院子裏的茶房，那是看得很淸楚的。一個是年約二十歲的女孩子，穿了一件長過腹部的短衣，一條黑裙子，高吊在膝蓋上，露出兩雙雪白的櫗子裏着大腿。便是頭上的頭髮，也是剪着平了後腦勺子。這分明是潼關外面的摩登少女了。在那煤油燈光下，雖看不出來，他是怎麽一種面貎，可是兩頰上的胭脂，塗着紅暈了一片，幾乎把耳朶下都塗抺了起來，那是看得出來的。他和茶房站得極相近，喞喞喳喳，在那裏説話。此外有個舊式打扮的婦人，看去年紀總在四五十歲，離着他們遠遠的。一個摩登少女，站在燈光不明的所在和旅館裏茶房這様親密的説話，那决不會是什麽好事。李士廉一壁廂向屋子裏走，一壁廂對那少女望着。那少女偶然回過頭來，見有人對他注意，似乎還带了一些淺笑，只可惜在黑暗下不大看得淸楚。（三七）</p>
<h3 id="c181">十三位算盤都成了九 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 梅雪</p>
<p>彭祖要投五百次人身打得成</p>
<p>在大學宿舍中的Ｆｒｅｓｈｍａｎ四川人也有，福建人也有，其他江浙人兩廣人居多數了。</p>
<p>一位紹興同學説：「假如有一把十三位的算盤类這兒，我們要從單位一個一個的加上，要把這把算盤加至每位都成了九數，須經多少時候？」一位同學不假思索地答道：「大槪要十年吧」紹興人搖了搖頭兒，表示相差太遠。其他，也有猜二三十年的，四五十年的，甚至一百年的，紹興人都搖着頭兒。就中有一位好學深思的某君，沈吟了一會子，笑着説道：「假如這個人在呱呱墮地的時候，便會打算盤，每天除了睡眠，飲食，排洩的時間以外，一刻不停地做那十小時的打算盤工作，直打到一百歲考終命而後停止。那麽要把十三位算盤打成第位都積至九數，須得在他百年考終以後，重投人身，投了人身，依舊呱呱墮地後便會打算盤，直打到一百歲老終命而停止，如是這般，須投四千次人身，經歷了四十萬年之久，才能把這十三位算盤打成每位都是九數。」人家聽了，都道他説謊，須得他指示一個實騐的方法。</p>
<p>某君不慌不忙地説道：「假如每一秒鐘可在算盤的單位上動作二次，便是加上兩個一，那麽一分鐘加至一二○，一小時加至七二○○，一天工作十小時，加至七二○○○，一月加至二一六○○○○，一年加至二五九二○○○○，百年加至二五九二○○○○○○，萬年加至二五九二○○○○○○○○，四十萬年加得的總數才與九九九九九九九九九九九九九差不多，那麽百歲老人打算盤，不是要打了四千世才能打完吧。就是請敎八百遐齡的彭祖打算盤他老人家也要投了五百次的人身，才能做完這打算盤打至十三位都成了九的工作。」</p>

<p>某女士向其未婚夫提出解約。夫曰：「我没有錯待你啊！爲了你，我用去數千塊錢，爲了你，我丢了很好的差使，爲了你，我給家庭逐出，爲了你：：：。一女士不耐煩地説道：「我就爲的是你丢了差使，爲的是你被家庭逐出，爲的是你自己没有錢再給我化啊·」</p>
<h3 id="c183">女兒經與婦女問題 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>女兒經，是一本封建時代女子的讀物；那上面全是講的做女孩子的應該怎様處理自己，怎様學三從四德，怎様做賢妻良母，怎様效法往古的烈女賢婦，以及一個女孩子怎様做人，從起居，飲食，勞作，衛生，以至思想，行爲，全都有極詳細的解説；使得一個做女孩子的理解了它，把伊們的思想，人生觀，都變成同一典型，永遠幽閉在暗室冁，受那舊道德的支配與威脅。</p>
<p>可是，時代是轉變了，封建的舊思想也變成了時代的渣滓。一個女子生活在這現代社會裏，其所受社會的待遇與機會，完全都和男子均等。女子在現時代算解放了，交際能够公開，經濟也能够獨立，同時，對於職業的獲取，也和男人一様基於它的本能。技巧，去解决它們生活的出路。</p>
<p>不過，任何社會都有它畸形發展之一缺點，所以婦女的出路問題，也有它極光明的一面，同時，也有其極陰暗的翳層；自然，現代婦女問題，因爲社會環境，思想的種種不同，顯然是較以前更見複雜而不易處理了。</p>
<p>聽説：明星公司最近拍了一部「女兒經」，就是以現代婦女問題爲中心題材，而給以偉大底啟發的。在那裏，它以雙十節爲故事的襯盡，很細膩地描出，許多婦女所遭遇到的人生歡樂的和諧，與慘痛的悲哀，並且，指示出一條正確解答的途徑。我想，這該是一部現代女性所宜必讀的一本最合適的聖經吧！</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>還虧慶善們有一些先見，在太后未啟程之前，早就知照了這裏的官吏，讓他們好有充分的時間，把這一座破舊的縣城，用心加一番修整的工夫，免得太后看見了不高興，所以當太后下令要在城内周覧一回的時候，大家都並不怎様慌張，因爲我們推想起來，有了那麽八九天的工夫，無論這些地方官如何不行，總該修整得有些頭緒了。其時，他們的一羣，也像天津站上的一羣同様地穿得十公富麗，濟濟蹌蹌的俯伏在站旁接駕。不過他們的官級都是很小的，没有一個能趕得上給太后注意；結果是他們等於白走了一次，不過使車站上格外增些熱閙而已，也許他們連太后的面都不曾見呢！</p>
<p>驚與從車站出發，就由當地的最高長官做引導，沿着幾條，比較最寛闊一些大道，慢慢地行去。這些街道，平時都是很髒的，今天却已一律鋪上了一重黄沙，把它們本來的醜面目全遮掩過了。我雖不知道太后見了作何感想，，但我自己對於這種臨時抱佛脚的佈置，却委實覺得非常不快。中國人無論做什麽事情，總不肯早些用工夫，實實在在的做去，多愛在臨急的時候，用些輕巧的方法，粉飾一時的太平：這便是一個現成的例子！後來，我們經過一座城門，傳虎發看透了這種病態。因爲城門的工程比較上要艱鉅得多，雖然有了七八天的準備工夫，但因平時一任它坍毁，不加修繕，臨時那裏修整得起來？便祇能讓它一個龍鍾不堪的老人似的斜跛着了。（一四七）</p>

<h3 id="c187">淸初的中海物價（下） <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>十，糖　上白蔗糖，在明季每斤要値銀三四分，順治間海疆多故，價至每斤紋銀四錢．直到康熙中，糖價始復舊狀，康熙二十年的冬天，白糖每斤値銀三分，赤糖祇値一分上下；康熙二十五年更賤至每斤二十文，合銀還不到二分。</p>
<p>十一，瓷器　江西瓷器本極珍貴，崇禎時最上精品値三五錢銀子隻，下劣貨品大約三五分銀可買十隻，順治初年，江南方定，兵事未息，瓷器不能運來上海，於是價驟昂貴，即是極惡劣不堪的碗，也要値四五分銀一隻。這時候上海的富家，便改用銅器錫器，貧民祇好用竹木製碗。康熙初年瓷器曾一度大賤，最上等的不過値銀一錢。康熙十三年因吳三桂的起兵，江右各地盜賊蜂起，瓷器又復大貴，和順治初無異。到二十七年後，方又回復康熙初元的廉賤。</p>
<p>十二，葛布　葛布多從浙江廣東江西等省販來，在明朝本供縉紳士大夫服用，不是一般平民的衣料，所以三丈多長的一疋，要値銀三兩。到了淸朝，葛布品質漸劣，價亦日跌，自康熙二十四年上海設立江海關，開放海禁以後，商船羣集，葛布愈來愈多，最上的每尺不過値銀一分五六釐，組劣的每尺祇値七八釐而已。</p>
<p>十三，繭綢　繭綢大多來自山東，以產於椒樹上的爲最佳，明季價値異常昂貴，每尺値銀一兩上下。淸初嘉湖蘇松俱有仿織，價値於是大賤，上等的不過一錢銀子一尺，次等的有三四分銀子就可以買一尺了。</p>
<p>十四，眼鏡　眼鏡從明朝起，就有西洋貨品到來，每副價銀四五兩，但貨極少，不是大有力的人家不容易購到。順治以後，蘇州杭州已能仿造，所以遍地都有販賣，上等的只要七八分銀子一副，最次的不過値二三分；可是西洋的近視眼鏡還是要二兩銀子，纔能買到一副。</p>
<p>十五，海味　淸初上海商肆中販賣的海味，有價錢可考的，祇是燕窩一種。明末每斤價需紋銀八錢，順治年間也有甚上下，康熙後大貴，每的値銀四兩，從此不是極盛的筵席，便不大用了。</p>
<p>十六，文具　竹紙每刀七十五張，崇禎時値銀二分，順治初和康熙十三年，因福建多事，價漲至每刀一錢四五分。康熙二十六的後，又成每刀二分的老價，但張數祇有七十張了。硃標在順治初每匣重十四兩，價紋銀八九兩，康熙初不過値二錢五分。圖章石最上等的靑田凍石，每兩祇値紋銀一兩多些。蘇州觀音山石製成的硯，每方可値銀二三錢。</p>
<p>十七藥材　藥材多非本地所產，康熙初年，因川廣兵事未息，有幾種要藥的市價，曾經意外地飛漲。例如附子每隻要售銀好幾十兩，鬰金每兩値至二百多金，肉桂也需十二三兩。到了康熙年間，四方平靖以後，附子一隻不過値銀一錢，鬰金一兩不過値價八分，肉桂每斤也不過値五兩了。</p>
<p>十八香料　明季檀香每斤値銀四五錢，降香每斤尙不到一錢。順治初價俱貴至四倍以上，不是大有力的人家，幾乎不大輕用。康熙十八年，傳聞宮内用檀香作滌器，於是市價大跌特跌，每斤祇値紋銀二錢，而道家設壇建𫒽，猶多禁止不用。降香因海市大開，販運的踵至，價値也就恢復到明季的原狀。</p>
<p>以上是明末到淸初四五十年間，上海物價的大槪，紀載散見於上海縣志，董含的三岡識略，葉夢珠的閲世編，姚廷遴的紀事等書，是研究淸初上海社會經濟狀况的極好史料。</p>

<p>— 孤西</p>
<p>日本作家夏目漱石曾經説：「人生二十而知有生之利益」，這大槪是説，凡人，在人世住上二十年的時候，才知人世有居住之價値，有居住之歡欣的意思：我對於這話，不能抱同感！</p>
<p>從自己説，今年正到了這一步年紀，可是那「有生之利益」這一層，却始終没有體感到！相反的，「人世不易住」這一個意念，倒的確是近來深味着的了！</p>
<p>一切人生手重荷，人生的困惱，像沉重的砂石的口袋壓在夫役們枯廋的脊背上様，到這時候，會開始來加緊我們這兩肩，使我們感到漫人間祇有着那麽一宗苦負！這一宗苦負，在二十歲以前，往往是給那幼小者的耕色的幻夢遮隱着的！</p>
<p>人間二十度的寒暑，是很容易將一個人小時候的天眞，小時候的單純底心侵蝕去！這辰光，他會開始知道人生並不像過去所想像的那麽美麗，那麽宽舒！二十歲以前，人們大槪都懷着一個微美生活着的。扯破這個微笑，呌你去相信這生活中「不如意事常八九」實在容不得你微笑出來的是這年頭。</p>
<p>每個人的理智，感情，意志，到這年頭，都想試試他們自己的翅羽。可是這地方就含有一種危機！二十歲時的理智，是容易使你碰釘子的：二十歲時的感情，是容易使你墮落的；二十歲時的意志，是容易呌你感到不自由的！從這地方，一種悲哀，就會輕輕地罩上你的心！</p>
<p>明朱國楨在湧幢小品中説：「二十以還，堅强自用，舞蹈欲前，視靑紫如拾芥，騖聲名若逐羶。」對於要官做要聲名的這様的勇士，我祇有伸長着頭頭欽羨他們，祝福他們！我自己呢，二十年來自己的一點小小的智慧使得我缺乏這一種「堅强自用，舞蹈欲前」的勇氣了！雖則説官很可以做做，可是我總覺得此事大不易！至於「聲名」這東西，我是一向就不大熱望的；高爾基説：「牛的聲名好，但他還要以乾草飽腹呢！」尤其對於像我這様的人，聲名總不過是一宗覊絆吧！</p>
<p>「依依父母，嬉嬉飽暖無慮無營，忘得忘失」像神仙様的兒童時代，到二十歲已成過去了，二十以還，所謂對於人世知道有居住之價値，有居住之歡欣這一點，我始終是没有感到的！</p>
<p>「擁抱着未來的：悲哀總比喜望多！」在人間過了二十度寒暑的我這様想。</p>
<h3 id="c207">江底之夜（續） <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>「叔叔呢？」</p>
<p>因爲晚上寂寞得太無聊了，便這様地問下去。</p>
<p>「叔叔没有住在這裏，半夜才：：：。呵喲，燒焦了同你聞味道哪！」他趕忙用鐵火箝撥開火堆，將一塊冒着烟的包榖挾了出來，作着一付似乎更比我懂事的嘴臉。</p>
<p>這時戽門突然呀的一聲開了，房裏油燈照着的微光也水瀉似的了出來，女主人生氣地出現地門口，拉着站在門前的二兒子，叱駡着：</p>
<p>「看你一刻也離不開，鬼東西，要我死了才好哩！」</p>
<p>但望她那臉上，生氣的様子，顯然是做出來的。等到走　火堆旁邊把二兒子同大兒安置在一塊時，她很迅速地瞥視我一下，彷彿偵察我是否有發覺她偷看包袱的様子，我却連忙避開，取一枝乾柴來架在火上。</p>
<p>「哇哇哇」另一個孩子在屋裏面，爆發似地哭起來了，這是先前她抱進屋裏去的。她却没有管他，只把一個裝滿什麽東西的瓦罐子。小小心心地煨在火堆裏，同時做聲做氣地吩咐兩個孩子説：</p>
<p>「留意哪！弄倒了，我要揪掉你們的耳朶的，鬼東西！」</p>
<p>好像也在向我示威一般，但我聽見她總把孩子們喊成「鬼東西」，却覺得是很好笑的。</p>
<p>大約是因爲她在做晚飯，接連地彎屈腰部的原故吧，搚在背上的嬰兒也跟着哭了起來，带着不馴服的呌聲。她這時才把拿在手裏的水瓢，入在碎了一點邊沿的水缸裏面發出男子那様沉重的足聲，跑進屋裏去，把哭着的第三個小孩子，像提鷄鴨那麽似地提了出來，給他一個耳光之後，就用她那剛剛打過他的粗手，靈敏地替他拭着鼻涕，一把把地朝身邊彈去。隨即把大孩子手中啃了一半的包榖抓着，一面駡道：</p>
<p>「脹死你！」</p>
<p>馬上又把這搶去的包榖，硬塞在小兒子的嘴上，將那張發出哭聲的嘴洞，莽　地堵住。同時惡狠狠地詛咒道：</p>
<p>「你再哭哪！你再哭哪！」</p>
<p>這第三的孩子，眞的不哭了，但背上哭着的那一個頂小的，却更加哭得兇横了。她反過手去，向背後亂拍了好幾下，才將他取了過來，抓開胸前的破衣洞，探出奶頭來，放在孩子的小嘴裏。於是，一切才歸於平靜了，只是屋後的江聲，却又分明地宏大地送了進來。</p>
<p>被奪去了包榖的大孩子，先是翹起上嘴唇，用一棧酒杯粗的乾柴，把火堆上燃着的小枝椏，故意挑散到旁邊去，這時却忽然將她媽媽吩咐過不凖碰倒的水罐子一下子敲翻了，蓋子和水和四季豆馬上都衝了出來，水汽和火烟濃重地上昇着。</p>
<p>「天殺的呀，挨刀刀兒的呀，你這斷嫩顚的呀，：：」</p>
<p>女主人暴哮似的哭噎起來，吃奶的嬰兒也接着大聲地啼哭着。</p>
<p>惹了禍事的大孩子，挨了媽媽一下拳頭之後，躱在黑角落裏小聲地抽噎，不敢哭出來。</p>
<p>▲　　▲　　▲</p>
<p>睡的時候，被引進店後一間小屋子，（大槪先前是給馬伕們睡覺的地方，）裏面發出一種久無人住的霉氣。带着浮塵的蜘蛛網，藉着菜油燈的淡黄光輝就像吊着許多流蘇一様地，現在屋頂下邊和四隻角上。床是兩條長凳上横放着三四塊松木板子配搭成的。除此而外，旣没有墊的草蓆，也没有蓋的棉被。</p>
<p>「這様怎好睡呢？老板娘。」</p>
<p>我望了屋子之後這様説，剛剛走出門檻外的女主人，便掉身轉來，將抱在懷裏的嬰兒，朝胸上一摟，板着面孔带着冷冰冰的神情説道：</p>
<p>「眞没法呵，將就點吧，客人！」（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c208">補臉神術 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>聊齋上的　判官，曾把一醜貎的女子，換了一個美貎的頭　。在泰西也有這種故事，那是一個女孩名呌Ｃｉｏｄｅｒｅｌｌａ。她因爲生得貎醜，所以姐姐們赴眺舞會時，總留她在家裏充酒掃賤役，蓬首垢面，無人睬理，後來感動了一位仙人，施用幻術，把她化爲美女，带到王子跳舞會中，王子一見傾心。我們讀了這些故事，自然目爲神怪之談，誰知二十世紀科學進步，竟有和此似乎相同的事實。</p>
<p>這種手術，醫學界名爲Ｐｌａｓｔｉｃ　Ｓｕｒｇｅｒｙ，譯義是塑形外科，求其簡單明瞭也可稱爲補臉術。這是醫術科學上的一種新成績，據法國著名腹部外科專家馬頭泰敎授説：「在十年或十五年之後，補臉術將成外科上最重要的一門。」英國醫界某種感也豫料不出十年，這種手術將　　科一般的普通。</p>
<p>據説這學理並不是新創的，東方的外科醫士，在二千年前已善用此法，尤可奇的，那法和現在相同。十六世紀中，意大利醫士曾紀載「接皮」手術數十起，都有良好的成績。一五九七年，太格里亞柯齋氏首先著成關於此術的敎科書一種。至於新近的成功，是受戰爭之賜，這的確是戰爭所造成的幾種有用產品之一。</p>
<p>誰都知道新時代戰爭的慘酷，枹火一作，血肉横飛。但死了也罷，最苦的是生命雖能保全，而肢體却已殘廢，尤其是五官不全，失去原形，親友會面，都不認識，人生到此，生趣全無。在一九一八年歐戰終止時，遺下這一類的戰士何止數十萬人，這便是塑形外科醫士奏刀施術的材料。在隱靜的醫院中，一月一月地替他們再造面龐，恢復人形，使他們不被人望而生長。</p>
<p>這些醫院中最大的，要算錫特克浦的療治面傷院，由外科名家吉里斯爵士經營。前後數年，共醫好一萬九千人，今日外科醫士的精巧補臉術，大都也是從這個醫院學來的。其成績幾乎令人不能相信，有一位加拿大軍官，他的牙床被砲彈炸去，他的臉也毀去一半，經醫士用數月的工夫，替他另造成一副新牙床，又替他把臉一寸寸地補好，甚至連眉毛都完全。還有好幾十人，面龐都是經過改造，才復人形。至於補平臉上深刻的創痕，那是不能以數計了。英國養老金部的某醫士曾説：「這種手術眞是鬼斧神工，妙不可言。」</p>
<p>在目前承平之時，這種手術，已移用於工業戰爭加於工人們身體上的毀壞，能够取身體上好的皮骨，或軟骨，或神經，來補好本人已毀的部分。現在舉個例子來説明吧。有一化學工作者，被酸將臉上皮膚蝕化一大部分，並且深入肉裏，經塑形外科醫士替他醫治，先用藥使他臉部麻痺，又止住淌血，再刮去腐皮，然後用一種流質物，塗在臉上，慢慢乾了，便結成一個柔軟的臉罩，及成爲受傷部分的一個模型。那模型直展至胸前未傷的皮上，再細心在他身上剜下厚薄恰好的皮一大塊，這便是造新臉的材料，把牠舖在燒焦的肉上，再用針線在邊際和好皮　牢。那裏的皮肉，自然會長好，猶如新遷的樹木一般，自然會活起來。那血管會伸出和靜脈動脈接通，等到縫處的痕跡長没，他又照常工作了。</p>
<p>手術所需用的薄皮，多可從身上許多部分取得，割皮之處，不到一月便長好新皮。就是剜深一點，也無妨，只要再從他處取薄皮舖上，便成。從前的外科醫士，只能移種小塊的皮，但經一位美國醫士發明之後，皮的面積，可以擴大。他發見移種後的皮，若是四面壓力平匀，便能好好地生長。那壓力的功效，是封閉外部血的供給，使新接的皮，安處在牠自己血和淋巴液中，同時牠的血管，會像植物細根一般，伸長出去，和循環的總流接通。</p>
<p>塑形外科術現在年年進步，最初不過割皮補傷罷了，現在能取皮，骨，軟骨，神經，造成新容貎，新臉架。有一病人，臉上神經不能活動，他的臉，顯然將終身僵呆，後來經醫士煞費苦心，替他試接神經，把他大腿剖開，取出無關重要的神經一條，接在臉上，猶如用銅綫接好已斷的電綫一般。不到三十天，那病人臉部，便能靈活，再靜養數月，表情一切，和尋常無異。這都是下苦工夫精心研究的效果。　　還有一女童，臉全毀壞，醫士經長久的耐性，替她補好。先取肋骨一段，逐節刻成一副新牙𦙣，再在她　上割下皮一�，造成眼臉鼻孔，然後由胸前剜肉，塡入口内，並做嘴唇，再由頭壳借用軟骨。經過二十五次的「接皮」，每次必須將皮安置平整，異常精細。末了竟造成一個新臉。現在你能在宴會中會見這個歡欣欣的女童。今後接骨也將有驚人的效果，現在已能用脛骨和　下之肉造成一個新大拇指。將來　能造成一隻新手，也未可知。</p>
<p>這種新術，和其他科學一般，也會發生意想不到的奇事。有一女子，因嘴唇破裂，醫士替她用面頰上垂下的皮補好，不料她每次嘴唇動作時、總覺得頰上受了感覺似的。還有一更奇之事，病者喉管爛壞，醫士替他用頸上的皮補好，不料十八個月後，他覺得咽物不便，原來那新皮已在内部長鬚，：：：這件事曾由一醫學報證實的。</p>
<p>從前臉上的　皮，可以把牠拉緊，而减去老態，大家已視爲神奇。但把今日的補臉術和牠比較，那拉皮手術，已算不了一回事。將來補臉術進　，説不定奇醜之人，都能化爲倩美，到那時，凡嫌老　貎醜的人，便能到處找到陸判官了。</p>

<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>今年之以「國貨」相標榜，原有婦女兒童雙料之稱，揆其意，當爲「娘兒母子」便於相率愛國之舉。搖旗呐喊的結果，是香水脂粉進口好多萬，珍飾花邊又好多萬，這當然有些使人慨嘆，國難愈亟，而「摩登」益盛，所謂國家將亡，必有妖孽的感喟。可是并道而行的「兒童國貨」，也未見挽回幾多人心，據報載於今年八月中，游戲玩具入口，已達國幣六十六萬餘之鉅。小孩子是在大人「耳提面命」之下，也不會若「摩登」女子之醉心奢侈淫靡，但是仍然不能盡多大的愛國之責，眞使我們不知道是將這些「無知孺子」抓來打屁股呢，或者責誰？</p>
<p>雖説這些飾好之微，關係國家民族之巨，可是我們從來就未將此全部罪惡責之婦女，自然更無用現在來責之於小孩子。一切奢侈品的消耗，都成了目今社會病態的表徵，這卽是説，中國的經濟愈破產，則一部份人吃著嗜樂的慾求愈增，而其結果必然是這方面「來路貨」供奉的湧進。用巴黎香水脂粉的不是全中國婦女，能玩「洋囝囝」及一切新式游戲玩具的不是所有的小孩子，這無疑是顯而易見的問題。</p>
<p>經濟破產已使中國的市塲極度减縮，而在日薄硽磁的情况下，袋裏充實的朋友亦正用聲色狗馬之好以自娛，因之擅長「子貢之術」的外人，便在這方面來找他的主顧。　陋得很的國貨運動，自然不能滿足這部份物質享受慾高的人的慾望。以摩登自詡的婦女旣已如此，又那能力量來號召這聽人指使，無識無知的小孩子！</p>
<h3 id="c211">擺擂台 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 吳飛</p>
<p>擺擂台的是英雄，打擂台的當然亦是英雄，擺擂台，打擂台，這種玩意兒在從前是常常有得聽見的，就是在若干年之前，還有馬永貞和霍元甲到洋塲十里的上海來擺擂台。但是很不幸，他們兩位英雄終於遭了暗算而傷生在不是英雄的手裏，實在是很可惜的！</p>
<p>可是擂台之在今日，確乎已經眼睛看不見，耳朶聽不到了。這因爲吾國的「文弱書生」和「带病美人」太多的緣故；而一般好武之士，又都風雅自賞，就是學得了幾手花拳繡腿，倒底够不上擺擂台的資格；何况在科學昌盛的今日，根本就没有擂台好擺，就是有，也只能够説它游戲則可，如要眞的打盡天下無敵手，那麽稱雄稱霸是萬萬不可以的。</p>
<p>凡擺擂台的人，他的本傾至少是自信不平凡的，而且同時也曾度量到很少人是他的對手；在他縱不能有來兩個退一雙的預料，但想自己總不至於會被打擂台者從台上摔下的。而且他穩站在台上不動，去打他者却須以下犯上，照地位而言，他多少總佔着些優勢；然而有時不幸遇到敵手時，會把他從幾丈高的擂台上摔下來，那是意外。</p>
<p>擺擂台者，他自以爲本領大似天，睥睨一切，傲視一切；所以説出話來總要带着驕傲的口吻。什麽拳打南北兩京咧，脚踢黄河兩岸咧，威武氣槪，不可一世，看來眞有些咄咄迫人的様子。這在打擂台的人，也因爲：一來聽了他這誇口有些不服氣，於是不免要去「試試咱老子的本領」，二來是眼看得他來耀武揚威，去打了他下來，也好顯得自己也是個英雄而殺殺他的鋭氣。但這也須量量自己的力量，究竟够不够？如果像夸父追日般的冒冒失失去幹，那豈不要糟糕。所以吾説：擺擂台是一椿很難的事情，而打擂台者却更不容易；這决不是人人可擺，也不是人人能打的。</p>
<p>日前，有少林寺臨濟正宗的張學斌，以求師訪友爲號召而在大滬花園内擺「梅花椿擂台」；据他自己説：他非但十八般武藝件件皆能，並且還精於所謂「金鐘罩」與「鐵布衫」功夫，能够刀槍不入（？）。這種説法，實在類似武俠小説上描寫的劍俠之流亞。在吾當然不是内家，更不能用科學的學理來證明他的有無；但照吾的揣想，這裏多少含着些謊話氣質。</p>
<h3 id="c212">關於年輕夫婦的育兒 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 櫻櫻</p>
<p>假使在一個全不拘束的小家庭裏。丈夫是滿年輕，妻子很够上美麗的，當然夫婦間愛情的濃烈不須説的；丈夫的專一愛着妻子，和妻子的溫存體貼丈夫，同様是正比例的！</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>不過問題是在有了愛的結晶總是怎様呢？丈夫卽使是無妨礙的話，至少在妻子責任上，是須照顧到自己和丈夫外，還須兼顧到孩子上身。</p>
<p>很多的事實往往妻子有孩子後，顯然重量從丈夫身上，傾顧到她的孩子，關於孩子的衣服，飲食，起居等。孩子是太可愛的話，每每無意中會很容易地將丈夫的愛，整個的剝奪過去。</p>
<p>於是這様對於夫婦們是發生了極端的危險！在以後丈夫得不到妻子的整個專愛後，很容易就會牽洩到孩子身上，由嫉妬孩子進而到恨怨！這好像並不怎麽不有因的一件事！</p>
<p>不過反言之，夫婦間欲永久保持着愛情的堅固，爲着自己的生活的舒適！於是在孩子身上是缺乏好的調養，或完全假　於人不顧，那末，更悲慘的事件是會更容易地這様發生出的！</p>
<p>年輕的有了孩子的母親，她須要有雙重的責任兼顧愛到丈夫和孩子的整個身上。（自然，有固定職業的，當然還是例外的）。她須極端的愛顧着孩子的一切，不過還須要兼顧到丈夫身上的一切，使丈夫並不感覺有了孩子而使他煩惡，厭棄，而甚至由嫉妬而怨恨；一様他能更順抻的得到專愛和引起有孩子的快活，樂趣！</p>
<p>年輕的母親，是怎麽的不容易拒任的一項繁重的工作呐！</p>

<p>— 張君</p>
<p>爲着她的憂鬰，我也憂鬰起來了：：：：</p>
<p>有兩隻大眼珠子的，圓圓的黑臉的，永遠在那眉尖上懸着憂鬰的記號的是她丨丨那天兒我問到名字的時候，她告訴我的是頂美麗的墨西哥風土味的雷夢娜。</p>
<p>（雷夢娜）！</p>
<p>便想起這是一部小説，後來製成一部影片，配着一支動聽的歌曲的名字。於是，我的嘴伸到她的耳朶邊：</p>
<p>丨丨雷夢娜！知不知道你敎我想起墨西哥，那里的海浜，那里的Ｒｉｏ　Ｇｒａｎｄ，那里的鬥牛塲？你的名字是一支曲子哪，三年前我成天地掛在嘴角，在熱带的棕關　下，椰枝里唱着。現在我郤忘却了；可是爲了你，我應當再次唱起來的呵！</p>
<p>第二天，带着一顆熱戀的心。我在北四川路的每一間歌譜發賣處找尋着“Ｒａｍｏｎａ”：愛普羅琴行，日本音樂店，良友公司。</p>
<p>丨丨“Ｒａｍｏｎａ”嗎？過時了哪！</p>
<p>丨丨“Ｒａｍｏｎａ”？你往對面那家去問題看。</p>
<p>眞的過時了嗎？雷夢娜是那麽年靑，淸晨的向日葵似的開放着。意外的僥倖在最後一家我得到了這曲本；馬上年輕了許多的様子，带跳地走出了門没來由地笑起來。</p>
<p>悄悄地，不讓人知道地，带着曲本趁了死寂的午後躱在校園裏的花叢下唱着；聲音低低地，夢囈似起丨丨</p>
<p>（上帝，讓我的虔敬的，純潔的，充滿着熱愛的聲音能够解除她的憂鬰吧。在那麽健壯的臉上給她塗上一層灰色的粉眞是不幸：爲什麽憂鬰呵！）</p>
<p>丨丨爲什麽憂鬰嗎？因爲男子是黑心的；他們不讓我和人在一起。這是多麽卑鄙的念頭呀，我眞害怕他們：：：</p>
<p>她給我訴説着，猛地伏在我的肩上哭了。</p>
<p>輕輕地撫摸着她，用着我的最熱情的話安慰着她；吻着她的被游泳池裏的水和夏天的日光燙黑了的脖子。我記起那支動聽的歌曲，就低低地唱了丨丨“：：Ｒａｍｏna，I　need　you　ｍｙ　ｏｗｎ．”</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>組織「學職互助恊進會」的一封信，承先生在貴刊發表後，我先後共接到四十六位同志來信參加這個組織。於是在上星期日晚八時便召集了第一次籌備會議，到會者只有二十三位。（通知信是星期六發出的，這也許有些人還没有收到，或者因爲職務關係不能來吧。雖然人數僅到一半，但各人都很興奮，很熱心，除少數人保安靜默外，多數人都紛紛提出意見，對於章程的原則逐條討論。一直到十時許，因爲時間的關係，我們便怱怱的選舉了九個籌備委員之後就告散會。</p>
<p>昨天我們幾個籌備委員又共同討論了一次。但因缺乏組織的經騐，有一個問題難於解决。就是基本金是由各會員量力捐助的，第一次籌備會議上，已捐得五十餘元，按月會費尙未决定，大槪總在四角與六角之間。經費似乎嫌少，所以要急切的徵求會員。不過，假使現在先把此會正式成立，再去徵求會員，雖然在形式上和組織上是比較好一點；但關於初創時設備，如寫字台，椅凳，及一切應用物件，實在無法籌措；而且每月房租更是一項很重的負擔。如果不設會址，借一個會員的地方作爲通信處吧，那似乎太形散漫了，會員們不能發生良好的印象，並且對於會員聚集研究學術，也發生困難。倘若暫時不宣告成立，　先去徵求會員以增加基金收入，這様，日子一定要拖延下去，一般先加入的舊會員因鑒於會務進展頗形遲緩，必致漸趨冷淡，（雖然也有幾位依舊熱心期待着，畢竟是少數了。）請先生替吾們想一個妥當的辦法，指示吾們怎様進行的步驟。</p>
<p>還有，一個團體的組織是不是一定要向市下府登記，登記的手續怎様？在成立後去登記，還是在未成立前去登記。假使吾們没有會址，可以登記不？也望先生詳細解答。並且希望先生把這封信公開發表，使未參加第一次籌備會的會員讀後可以知道一點大略，而意志相合的職業同志都可踴躍地來參加這個組織，我的通信處是：北京路三六○弄十四號柳風編輯部。此祝撰安。</p>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>編者按：黄君等在很短的時期内，能够把這個團體組織起來，其熱忱與毅力，均屬難能可貴。現在你們可以先行正式成立，關於會址，假使一時没有相當的地方，那末可向靑年會，市高會，及中華職業敎育社等團體商量，暫借他們的地方召集會議；此外還可以在各公園中舉行。在初創時期不一定要自己租賃會所，並且事實上也没有能力做到啊。至於平時的聯絡，可由會員中環境較好，職務較高的人負責，將他的辦公處或住址，暫作通訊機關。</p>
<p>關於基金已經捐到五十餘元，更見各人對於創辦團體的熱心。不過編者希望將此項存欵，留作將來經常零瑣支出之用。寫字檯，椅凳等物，可以暫就各人已有的設備辦事，有必過求舒適。另租房屋，現在似不十分需要。在開始組織的時候，祇求基礎鞏固，各項用費總以節省爲上。</p>
<p>各個團體在成立的時候，都應該先向當局登記，其手續可向本市黨部詳詢。</p>

<p>To Arrange Takeover Matters</p>
<p>Representatives of the Qing Imperial Family Elected for the Eastern Mausoleums Preservation Committee</p>
<p>(Beiping) The plan for the takeover of the Eastern Mausoleums in Malanyu has been drafted. China and Japan will be responsible for the handover by Yin Rugeng and Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy. Yin has already sent Yin Tixing, director of the Malanyu Office of the Jiji Miyun District Government, to make arrangements today. Yin Rugeng is scheduled to inspect the area with Shibayama on the 14th. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Because the date of the Malanyu takeover is approaching, Yin Rugeng has repeatedly sent letters to Zaitao, director of the Eastern and Western Mausoleums Affairs Office, urging him to select representatives to establish the Eastern Mausoleums Preservation Committee as soon as possible. He received a reply a few days ago stating that four representatives have been selected, but their names have not yet been announced. After receiving the letter, the Jiji Miyun District Government sent Yin to Tianjin to discuss with Yu Xuezhong. After Yin Rugeng and Shibayama inspect Malanyu, they will return to Beiping to start organizing and set a formal takeover date. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The War Zone Reorganization Committee will be established in Beiping soon. The fifth meeting of the Political Reorganization Committee approved the establishment of a local administrative personnel training institute. The address has been selected at the Shihu Hutong Civilian University. The address for the rural instructors training institute has not yet been found and is planned to be in a suitable location in the suburbs near Beiping to provide practical training. Both institute directors will be concurrently held by Huang Fu. However, due to Huang's busy public affairs in North China, each institute will have a deputy director to specialize in all administrative and management matters within the institute and provide training on a regular basis, such as the Lu Shan Officers Training Corps receiving training in rotation. It is scheduled to be formally established in mid-November. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a memorial service for the 39th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ordeal at 8:00 AM on the 11th. About 500 people attended, including Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Ye Chucang, Lin Sen, Zhang Ji, Zhao Pilian, Ma Chaojun, Shi Ying, and staff members. Chairman Wang delivered a speech, and Luo Jialun reported on the circumstances of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ordeal. The meeting adjourned at 9:00 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Jialun reported at the central memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ordeal on the morning of the 11th, stating that six years ago, while studying the Sino-Japanese issue, he reviewed the former President's archives and discovered various secret telegrams regarding the Qing court's handling of the President, learning many historical facts about this ordeal. The President's actions were monitored by detectives when he went to England from the United States, and Gong Zhaoyuan sent Englishman Macartney to arrange everything, so the President was eventually arrested. The impact of this historical event was that world public opinion sympathized with the Chinese revolution, increasing the President's international reputation and the faith of overseas Chinese. We also recognize the President's great spirit, his kindness to others, and his tireless pursuit of knowledge, which did not change even when his life was in danger. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The 11th was the 39th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ordeal in London.

<p>Chairman Lin Sen Reports on the Significance of the Celebration</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government and the National Government jointly held a National Day commemoration at the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM on the 10th. About 600 people attended, including Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Zhang Ji, Shao Yuanchong, Shi Qingyang, Luo Jialun, Zhu Peide, Chen Shuren, Liu Shouzhong, Kong Xiangxi, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Gongbo, Wang Shijie, Wang Yongbin, Li Yuanding, Chen Qicai, Cao Haosen, Chen Xunyong, Zhang Yipeng, Zhang Zhizhong, Chen Ce, Lin Xiang, Shi Ying, Zhang Mojun, Qin Fen, Lü Chao, and Wei Huai, as well as staff members of various ministries and commissions.

Recalling that on this day 23 years ago, comrades of our party launched the Wuchang Uprising, sacrificing countless martyrs, overthrowing the Manchu Qing autocracy, and establishing the Republic of China, thus giving birth to this National Day. Before the Xinhai Revolution, the President led his comrades in revolution with great fearless spirit. Although he suffered repeated setbacks, his determination to fight became stronger. After the Huanghuagang Uprising, he moved even more comrades. The spirit of revolution was renewed and strengthened, and they bravely moved forward, finally achieving the success of the Xinhai Revolution and leaving behind this eternally boundless National Day as the greatest memorial day. Today, at the commemoration ceremony, we must never forget the revolutionary achievements of the martyrs. During this time of national crisis, we should hold the determination to endure humiliation and bear the burden of responsibility, work hard to find a way out, and do our best and be loyal to our duties. He hopes that the people of the country will continue the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs, and the future will be full of hope. The music ended and the ceremony was completed at around 10:00 AM. They all went to the front yard inside the gate for a group photo and then dispersed. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 10th)</p>

<p>The Majority Supports Sending It Directly to the National Assembly</p>
<p>Zhang Zhihan and Others Designated to Re-draft the New Amendment</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held a meeting at 2:30 PM on the 11th to continue deliberating on the draft constitution. Seventy-five members, including Zhou Wei, attended, chaired by Sun Ke. He stated that Article 108 of Section 6 of Chapter 4 has been changed to Article 99. The content of this article is of great importance, and Lin Bin and four other members were designated to review it again. It was submitted for discussion at the meeting on the 11th. Now, Lin is asked to report on the results of the review. Lin reported that the review committee, according to the President's legacy and the opinions of the members, has submitted a new amendment, believing that it is inappropriate in theory and in fact to directly submit the impeachment case of the President, Vice President, and Presidents of the various Yuans to the National Assembly. It is proposed that a special disciplinary committee be jointly formed by the Judicial Yuan and the Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee as the agency to hear this major impeachment case. If the special disciplinary committee believes that there is a reason for the impeachment of the President and Vice President, it will then submit it to the National Assembly for a decision on whether or not to remove them. During the adjournment of the National Assembly, a decision should be made by a temporary National Assembly. If the special disciplinary committee believes that there is a reason for the impeachment of the Presidents of the five Yuans, it may submit a request to the President for their dismissal. Huang Youchang said that the new amendment still has two shortcomings: 1. When the National Assembly is in session, the impeachment case of the President and Vice President still needs to be reviewed by the special disciplinary committee, which seems to conflict with the powers of the National Assembly; 2. When the Presidents of the Yuans elected by the National Assembly and the Presidents of the Yuans appointed by the President are impeached, the special disciplinary committee believes that there is a reason to submit a request to the President for their dismissal, which seems to erase the power of the National Assembly to remove them. Hu Xuanming, Luo Ding, and others opposed the establishment of a special disciplinary committee, while Wu Shangying still advocated maintaining the new amendment. At this point in the discussion, the chairman summarized the opinions of the members into two principles: 1. The impeachment case of the President, Vice President, and Presidents of the five Yuans must first be reviewed by an agency before being submitted to the National Assembly; 2. It is advocated to directly submit it to the National Assembly. A vote was taken, and 64 people supported sending it directly to the National Assembly. The chairman designated Zhang Zhihan and five other people to re-draft the amendment according to this principle. The original Article 111, "The Control Yuan shall establish an Audit Committee to manage audit and inspection affairs," Zhao Wenbing advocated changing it to establish an Audit Department, while Wei Tingsheng, Gu Zhenggang, and Wang Wei maintained the original proposal. It was then amended to, "The Control Yuan shall establish an Audit Committee to manage audit affairs," and passed the second reading. The original Article 112, "The Audit Committee shall have one chairman of the Audit Committee and six members of the Audit Committee, who shall be nominated by the President of the Control Yuan according to law and appointed and dismissed by the President," was amended to "The Chairman and members of the Audit Committee shall be nominated by the President of the Control Yuan according to law and appointed and dismissed by the President," and passed the second reading. The original Article 113, "The resolution report of the Audit Committee shall be announced according to law after being reviewed by the plenary meeting of the Control Yuan," amended the words "plenary meeting" to "meeting" and passed the second reading. The original Articles 114, 115, 116, and 117 were all passed the second reading according to the original text. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The regular meeting will be held at 9:00 AM on the 12th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e17">The King of Yugoslavia Assassinated Heng <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Twenty years ago, the Austrian Crown Prince toured the south and was killed by a Serbian assassin, which led to the Great War in Europe. Since that war, this small Serbia has merged with the formerly Austro-Hungarian-controlled Croats and Slovenes to form Yugoslavia. Unexpectedly, twenty years later, the King of Yugoslavia has again died at the hands of a Croat. At this time of international turmoil, it is truly a feeling of "rare coincidence." The previous tragedy occurred because the Serbian people of the provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina were under Austro-Hungarian rule, hindering the Serbian people's Greater Serbia ideology. The latter tragedy occurred because the Croats, under the mixed rule of the three Yugoslav groups, were unable to develop their independent actions. Therefore, although the time and place of their occurrence are different, their nature is quite similar.</p>
<p>However, although their nature is similar, there are also differences. The Serbs and Austro-Hungarians are of completely different ethnicities, and naturally, they were unwilling to be ruled by foreigners. This is one difference. Although Serbia's territory was small at that time, it was still an independent country. Since the Austrian Crown Prince died at the hands of a Serb, Austria had the necessity to declare war on Serbia. This is not the case with the Croats today. First, they are not an independent country, and second, they belong to the same Slavic race as the Serbian people and are still one of the Yugoslav ethnic groups. Therefore, this tragedy is purely an internal problem of Yugoslavia, and the results it produces will be different from the previous war.</p>
<p>Why is this tragedy an internal problem of Yugoslavia? This is not difficult to understand. Although today's Yugoslavia is an expansion of the former Serbia, its ethnic groups all belong to the Slavic family. However, based on differences in language, customs, religion, and civilization, excluding a few ethnic minorities, it can be divided into three major groups: the Serbs, who account for about seven million; the Croats, who account for about three million; and the Slovenes, who account for about one and a half million, plus two and a half million from smaller ethnic groups, for a total of fourteen million people. The Serbs mostly belong to the Greek Orthodox religion, and the alphabet they use is also different from that of the Croats. In terms of culture, the Serbs are mostly farmers and have Eastern ethnic characteristics. However, the Croats and Slovenes have long been under Austro-Hungarian rule and are more advanced than the Serbs in terms of culture and industry. They belong to the Catholic Church. However, during the Great War, the three groups shared a sense of adversity and knew that without joining forces to unite and form a common country, it would be insufficient to cope with future difficulties. Therefore, the Corfu Declaration was established in 1917, which became the initial charter for the founding of Yugoslavia. However, among the three groups, the Serbs were the most numerous, so the Serbs took the advantage in politics. Therefore, they used their political power everywhere to continue their pre-war Greater Serbia ideal. However, from the perspective of the Croats, this policy actually made them regress and gradually orientalize. Therefore, they gradually felt that it was a miscalculation to merge with Serbia in the first place. In 1919, the Croats once organized a Croatian Republic, which was quickly destroyed and did not last long, but the movement for separation and independence never waned. By 1923, the Croats had another attempt to organize a country, but it also failed. Later, although the Croats often tried to win in the parliament, the results were few. After the assassination of Croatian political leader Radić in 1928, King Alexander of Yugoslavia abolished the constitution, banned party activities, and took over the power to implement a policy of assimilation of Croat and Slovene regions. This fundamentally struck a blow to the Croats' separation and independence movement. In 1931, Alexander promulgated the Royal Constitution. Although the upper and lower houses were established, half of the upper house members were appointed by the king, and half were elected by the people. The lower house members were elected from a list prepared by the government. Therefore, it was difficult for the representatives of the Croats to win in both houses. This is the reason why the Croats resented Alexander. Therefore, the background of the death of the King of Yugoslavia this time is purely internal.</p>
<p>However, recent developments in the international situation have also contributed to the rapid outbreak of this tragedy. In order to achieve their separation and independence, the Croats were unwilling to see Yugoslavia's international status become more secure. However, since this spring, first, the signing of the Balkan Pact has greatly stabilized Yugoslavia's position in the Balkans. In March and September of this year, Alexander visited Bulgaria twice, which dissolved the long-standing feud between the two countries. Recently, due to France's mediation, Italy's attitude towards Yugoslavia will also be greatly improved. All of these are sufficient to strengthen the unification of Yugoslavia and facilitate the Serbs' assimilation policy. It is reasonable for the Croats to value the King of Yugoslavia's visit to France this time and believe that it is the key to the fate of the Croats in the future. Therefore, there is no doubt that the assassin's actions were purely politically motivated.</p>
<p>As for the impact of this incident on the international situation, it can also be said.</p>
<p>(1) According to the observations of some European diplomatic representatives stationed in Washington, D.C., the Croats may take advantage of this change to seek to break away from Serbia or demand a high degree of autonomy. The result may cause serious international disputes. Most Italians and Croatian nationalists express sympathy, while France advocates that the Croatian nation should unite with the Serbs.</p>
<p>(2) The death of the King of Yugoslavia may affect the future London Naval Conference. The coordination of France and Italy is a prerequisite for the smooth progress of the naval conference, and Alexander has always opposed it. Italy's policy in the Adriatic Sea conflicts with the interests of Yugoslavia. Disputes have continued since the war. Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, commonly known as the Little Entente, are under the Versailles system with France and Belgium. The French secretly regard themselves as their protectors. Since the French want to coordinate with Italy, they must first eliminate Yugoslavia's backlash in order to win the favor of the Little Entente countries. Barthou has been running around, traveling between Barlette and Rome. The biggest mission is to reach an understanding before Mussolini's speech in Milan. He has expressed his willingness to peacefully resolve the conflict with the South and is particularly satisfied with the close relationship with France. Now that the King of Yugoslavia and Barthou have unfortunately died at the same time, the relationship between France, Italy, and the South will inevitably be greatly affected. Moreover, the balance of power in the Balkans has been shaken as a result, and major changes have taken place in the Mediterranean situation. The British may pay special attention to this matter, and it is not impossible to build more warships to monitor the Italians. If Britain and Italy compete to build warships, the United States, France, and Japan will hardly sit idly by. As a result, it will not only run counter to the purpose of naval disarmament.</p>
<p>(3) Italy has repeatedly declared that it will do its best to maintain the independence and integrity of Austria in order to prevent the Vienna government from becoming friendly with the German National Socialist Party. Yugoslavia was originally a part of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire. Because Austria has a movement to revise the Treaty of Trianon, it is deeply afraid that once it becomes a reality, it will be unfavorable to its own country. Therefore, it wants to unite with Germany to contain Austria and resist Italy. In May of this year, German government Aviation Minister and Prussian Prime Minister General Göring personally visited Nanjing and publicly declared that Yugoslavia was a major power in the Balkan Peninsula, which was disliked by Austria and Italy. The diplomatic community also regards Göring's actions as another proof of the close friendship between Germany and Yugoslavia to resist Italy's policy in Central Europe, which may not be an overstatement. Now that the King of Yugoslavia has died prematurely and the Crown Prince has ascended the throne at a young age, it would be fortunate enough to maintain domestic peace. It is feared that it will be difficult to continue his father's legacy, unite with Germany to resist Italy. What can be predicted is that, according to the recent declaration of the French government, France will pay more attention to Yugoslavia's national policy in the future. In times of crisis, it will not hesitate to provide substantial assistance. Moreover, the Queen of Alexander is a Romanian princess. The two countries can help each other due to their marriage and alliance relationship in order to maintain this extraordinary situation and keep the young master in his position. If there is no internal strife in Yugoslavia, the international disputes on the surface may not be difficult to eliminate.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Issues Another Order to Ban Opium in Various Provinces <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek recently telegraphed the governments of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces, ordering them to ban the cultivation of opium. The telegram stated, "Opium has been poisoning our country for decades. The reason why it has not been eradicated is that the government lacks strict and unified control measures and there are no consistent and effective steps. The practice of tolerating and accommodating has led to the increasing cultivation of poppies. Even in provinces and regions that did not previously cultivate opium, they gradually disregard the laws and secretly cultivate opium. As the production of opium increases, so does the number of people addicted to it. This chairman deeply knows that to eliminate the scourge of opium and eradicate the poisonous atmosphere, it is necessary to start with banning cultivation in order to achieve a thorough cleansing effect. Previously, the bandit suppression headquarters of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces issued measures for assigning personnel to investigate and ban opium cultivation in ten provinces, as well as precautions for investigating and banning opium cultivation. If the provinces can earnestly follow and advance in an orderly manner, it would not be difficult to gradually eradicate opium. However, in remote counties and remote areas of the provinces where opium was banned last year, according to investigations, there is still much secret cultivation, which is extremely distressing. It must be known that whether the opium ban can be implemented is greatly related to the rise and fall of the nation and international credibility. Local officials must not be allowed to continue to condone and tolerate this. Now, I am issuing the previous order again, urging you to earnestly abide by the previous opium ban measures and the precautions for banning cultivation, and to strictly prohibit sowing within the year 23 of the Republic of China, so as to eliminate poisonous plants together. Next year, no opium seedlings are allowed to emerge. This headquarters will not temporarily appoint supervisors, but will send secret investigators to conduct strict inspections anytime and anywhere, take photos, and secretly report. All supervisory tasks are completely entrusted to the provincial governments to earnestly implement, strictly order the counties to obtain guarantees from each township that opium will never be cultivated, and the county magistrate should add a ban on cultivation seal, which will be submitted to the provincial government for verification. When necessary, personnel will be sent to conduct general inspections. If any opium seedlings are found in the counties that have reported that opium cultivation has been banned and opium seedlings have been eradicated, the county magistrate, the investigators, and the gentry and planting households who have provided guarantees will all be severely punished in accordance with military law, without any leniency. If there is any military garrison protecting opium cultivation, the local administrative supervisor or county magistrate may directly telegraph this headquarters for verification. In addition to sending telegrams separately, I am urgently ordering the provincial government to comply with and forward to all subordinates to strictly abide by and report the compliance situation at any time for verification. Chiang Kai-shek's seal." (Central News Agency, 11th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Interior asked whether the local administration of the Mausoleum Area should be handled by the Mausoleum Management Committee, or should it still be managed by Jiangning County. Whether the autonomous region should be established as a special case, as an area between the county and the township, or should it be set up as a special autonomous experimental area, not subject to the current autonomous laws and regulations. What is the status of the administrative region and which administrative region is it equal to. In addition to issuing documents to ordinary provincial and municipal governments, should all laws and regulations promulgated by the Central Government be issued to the Mausoleum Management Committee at the same time. Is the Committee a central agency or a local agency? What should be the relationship between the various departments of the Central Government and the various local governments and the Mausoleum Management Committee? How should its powers and scope be defined? The government has no clear regulations. Please the Executive Yuan to submit to the Central Government for clear regulations on the above points in the regulations of the Mausoleum Management Committee. Subsequently, the Central Political Conference resolved that: 1. Judicial matters in the Mausoleum Area shall be handled by the Jiangning District Court. 2. The household registration of tenants and workers in the Mausoleum shall be handled by the Mausoleum Management Committee in conjunction with the Nanjing Municipal Government in the designated areas of Nanjing City for registration and elections. The above matters were communicated to the Civil Service Office of the National Government on the 11th and forwarded for compliance. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Representatives from the League of Nations Opium Suppression Committee, the United States, and Spain stated that the large amount of caffeine and acetic anhydride imported into China in recent years is clear evidence of the manufacture of huge quantities of heroin. Our representative Hu Shi-ze suggested that customs list these items in a special clause and limit their import volume. The Ministry of Finance stated that acetic anhydride, in addition to being used in conjunction with heroin, can also be used to manufacture various non-toxic drugs, chemicals, neutral pigments, and wood acetate materials. As for caffeine, in addition to being used with lactose or narcotics to prepare red pills, it can also be used in conjunction with non-toxic drugs. If these two items are completely controlled, the legitimate businesses that use them to prepare other items will inevitably be damaged. Even if restrictions are imposed, these items may still be manufactured domestically. Unscrupulous merchants can still use them to manufacture heroin, so prevention is still ineffective. As for listing in a special clause for statistics, this can be done. The Standing Committee of the Opium Suppression Committee decided to postpone the restriction on caffeine and acetic anhydride until clear statistics are available. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>

Although it has been decided to allocate the Boxer Indemnity in installments, the banks are very willing to advance some funds because the funds are indeed reliable to help with preparations.

<p>(Fuzhou) A telegram from [] to Fujian stated that the remnant bandits of Fang and Luo fled to Baojia Village and were pursued by our division. The bandits resisted stubbornly at Jinyin Mountain and Songfu Ridge. The battle was extremely fierce. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers charged bravely more than ten times, and the bandits died and were wounded in piles before they fled in a panic. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Headquarters News: The [] team advanced to Hubobei, five li east of Hetian, on the 6th. The bandits did not fight and abandoned all of Hetian and retreated west. We immediately occupied the nearby high mountains and built fortifications. Hetian is under the mountain and has become an empty town. We also did not garrison there, but crossed it with a part of our forces and gradually advanced westward. Although Hetian is important, it is not dangerous. Therefore, when the Nanshan Dam in the second line was breached, the bandits abandoned it without defending it. We also did not pay much attention to it. It is now 40 li away from Ting, all of which is flat land without high mountains. According to reports, the bandits also have the intention of abandoning Ting and retreating west without fighting. The capture of Ting is expected to be without much fighting and is very close, even during the day. Now that Shicheng has fallen and Changting is undefended, the bandits may abandon the Jiangxi-Fujian border altogether. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Zhai Jianmin, the regimental commander of the pseudo-13th Division, 38th Regiment, came over and confessed the situation of the bandit soldiers fleeing. The bandits are now using hundreds of thousands of our troops to encircle and attack them, so they are trying their best to expand the Red Army and implement the so-called mobilization work, conscripting able-bodied men for replenishment. However, the general public is suffering too much from the bandit army, without clothes or food, so they are taking the opportunity to flee. Each regiment has more than a hundred people deserting in a month. In Luokou before, there were many bandit soldiers who deserted. Most of the bandit soldiers of the pseudo-5th Army Corps were from Luokou. After the bandit soldiers deserted and returned home, the whole family had to flee, because they were afraid that the bandit government would find out and kill the whole family. Previously, when our army was about to pursue them to Luokou, the bandit soldiers who deserted and the refugees organized a desertion group of thousands of people and fled to our side. Now, the old soldiers of the bandit side (those who enlisted in February of this year) are their cadres. The new soldiers have no training and are only taught to load and unload bullets before going into battle. The officers monitor the soldiers extremely strictly, and the officers themselves and the soldiers are monitored by political commissars. If they hesitate at all, their lives are in danger. Every step they take is also monitored by their so-called resolute elements. Each company and battalion has resolute elements secretly mixed in, so the general psychology is one of terror all day long. (Central News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Bai Chongxi's winter telegram: After Xiao bandits were defeated by our army on the 25th, they attempted to cross Huangqiao and flee northeast. They were intercepted by two battalions of our forces. Being in a very desperate situation, they fled to Bagua River. I sent two regiments to suppress them there on the morning of the 26th. The bandits were frightened and, after a brief encounter, fled to Daqing. The two regiments continued to pursue them closely, and the bandits were forced to flee north through Xiafengxi and Liang Kou to join He bandits. I have sent a large army to continue the fierce pursuit, and have telegraphed the Guizhou army to prepare for interception, and the Zhenyuan troops to block the river, in order to annihilate them. The investigation of the bandits in the area south of the Zhenyuan River revealed that the bandits had been fiercely pursued by our army for two days at Bagua River. The bandits abandoned many wounded bandits and luggage along the way, which was shocking to see. Their embarrassment had reached its limit, and there were also scattered bandits hiding in the mountains. When our army arrived, many of them immediately surrendered with weapons. The bandits were all skin and bones, which shows that the bandit's combat power is weak. If they are severely attacked once or twice again, they can be eliminated. In addition, the bandits left in Fengxi, about two to three thousand, first fled to Daqing and were severely attacked by our division, killing three to four hundred bandits, etc. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>

<p>The Assassin is of Croatian Descent</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Barthou Also Dies</p>
<p>Marseille – Yugoslavian King Alexander and French Foreign Minister Barthou were assassinated by a Croatian merchant this afternoon. This was King Alexander's first official visit to France after the European War. He was killed just minutes after arriving, causing a great shock to the diplomatic world. The King was assassinated at 4:10 PM this afternoon. The King and French Foreign Minister Barthou were riding in the same car when, upon reaching the stock exchange, a Croatian man named Karimen suddenly emerged from the crowd, jumped onto the car's fender, and fired a pistol through the window at the occupants. The King was hit by three bullets and immediately collapsed, bleeding from the mouth and chest. Barthou was hit in the abdomen and left arm. After the assassination, the perpetrator attempted to commit suicide with the gun, but was stopped by police. As they were about to take him into custody, the enraged crowd seized him and beat him to death on the spot.</p>
<p>King Alexander died minutes after being shot, the bullets piercing his chest. French Foreign Minister Barthou died at 5:40 PM, the bullet lodged deep in his abdomen. He was already unconscious when surgery was performed and could not be saved. After being shot, the King was taken to the police chief's office in the county government. Despite all efforts to save him, he could not be revived and died within minutes. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Belgrade – News of the assassination of King Alexander and French Foreign Minister Barthou was not initially announced. It was not until this morning that the government released an official statement, saying that it was deeply aware of the difficult situation and was taking steps to ensure national stability.

<p>Struck by Four Bullets, Dies Instantly</p>
<p>Barthou Also Sacrificed</p>
<p>Assassin of Southern Descent Killed on the Spot</p>
<p>Marseille – King Alexander I of Yugoslavia was riding in a car through the main streets of Marseille at 4:00 PM today, amidst welcoming cheers from the crowd, when he was assassinated by his political enemies exiled in France. Five others also died, including French Foreign Minister Barthou, who attempted to shield the French dignitary with his own body and was also sacrificed. This event is the most shocking since the assassination in Serbia. Other deceased include General George, a French military officer in the King's entourage, Count Jevtic, a court minister of the Southern Kingdom, an adjutant to the Southern King, and a French police officer. Five others were seriously injured, including French Admiral Bedreau. Queen Marie, who was traveling to Paris separately by train, fortunately escaped unharmed.</p>
<p>Last night, police announced that at least two people from the Southern Kingdom were involved in the assassination. The gunman who killed the King and Barthou was a 40-year-old merchant named Kilmen, who was killed by police and trampled by the crowd. The identity of the other person is not yet confirmed and is currently in police custody. It is reported that Kilmen is a Croat and belongs to a secret political party that vowed to kill the King because his autocratic policies were destroying Croatian autonomy. The tragedy occurred just minutes after the King arrived and began his motorcade. Marseille was warmly welcoming the monarch of a friendly nation, with warships lining the port, the French flagship firing salutes, and thousands of troops lining the coast and main roads. Military music filled the air as the King passed by, and French flags fluttered. Foreign Minister Barthou formally welcomed the King upon his arrival, and the King shook hands with everyone. Shortly after boarding the car, which was surrounded by many secret agents for protection, the King sat with Barthou and Count Jevtic, while General George sat on a folding chair and the adjutant sat next to the driver. The King's car was the fourth in the motorcade and slowly moved forward, reaching Cannabiere Street, where about 20,000 spectators lined the street, cheering and eager to catch a glimpse of the King. The King smiled and nodded, and occasionally saluted. The car was moving very slowly, and before it had gone a hundred feet from the port, Kilmen broke free from the police and jumped onto the running board of the car, immediately firing a pistol directly at the King, continuing to shoot until he was stabbed in a vital spot by the police. He did not think of escaping, clearly having decided to risk his life. The King was shot four times, and without saying a word, collapsed in the car, spitting blood from his mouth. Barthou was wounded in the arm by the first shot, but still jumped forward, trying to shield the dignitary, placing himself in front of the gunman's weapon. However, Kilmen pushed him away, and Barthou fell. The driver was very brave, punching Kilmen in the jaw, causing him to fall backward, resulting in two wild shots, one hitting General George and the other hitting the adjutant in the head. At this time, Kilmen stood up again, still holding his gun, but was simultaneously stabbed in the head by two mounted police officers, falling to the ground instantly. As the gunfire erupted, police also fired rifles, resulting in twenty people being injured, one of whom was Admiral Bedreau and three women. The crowd was furious and rushed forward, causing the guards to stop firing. The injured cried out in agony, and the crowd was shocked and terrified, running in all directions. The assassin was trampled. Soon the police were able to restore order, and the King's car slowly drove to the police station. Barthou's injuries were not discovered until the King was carried out of the car, and he was immediately taken to the hospital. The King died at 4:15 PM. At 5:00 PM, the doctors treating Barthou said that he was not in danger, but at 5:45 PM, Barthou also died. Although doctors performed a blood transfusion, it was ineffective. The adjutant died immediately, George lingered until 6:00 PM, and Count Jevtic died at 6:30 PM. At 8:30 PM, one of the injured guards also died. The provincial government here lowered the flag to half-mast at 5:00 PM, but at that time it was still unknown whether the deceased was the King or Barthou. (National News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e43">Assassin's Background Investigated <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Orim Party Instigated</p>
<p>Headquarters in Bulgaria</p>
<p>Marseille – Police have investigated the assassin of the King of Yugoslavia and Barthou, Kariman, who stayed two nights at a hotel in Aix-en-Provence (near Marseille) on Sunday and Monday. The hotel owner, after being shown a photo of the assassin, confirmed that the person who stayed there was indeed Kariman. The pattern tattooed on the assassin's arm (i.e., the letters VMRO, a skull, and the Bulgarian words "Freedom or Death") has been identified by police as the secret code of the "Orim" Party. The "Orim" Party is a secret organization whose purpose is to unite the lands inhabited by the Macedonian people. Its headquarters are located in Bulgaria, and all the disturbances in Yugoslavia are instigated by this group. The leader of the group, Michailov, has left Bulgaria for Turkey. Since the visit of the late King Alexander of Yugoslavia to Bulgaria at the end of last month to conclude a treaty between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, Bulgarian Prime Minister Georgeff has ordered the dissolution of the "Orim" Party and told reporters that he was not afraid of any incidents after the dissolution. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>French Detective Squad Fully Mobilized (Paris) The National Detective Squad is now working hard to investigate the background of the assassin Kariman. Interior Minister Fondeur has ordered the police authorities to conduct a thorough study of the passport carried by Kariman to see if it is forged. In addition, the Ministry of Interior stated in the clearest terms that there was only one assassin and that the French police had not neglected any necessary protective measures. Before the King arrived in France, the police had been monitoring Yugoslavs who opposed the monarchy or belonged to the Croatian autonomy movement. The French police had also obtained a list of Yugoslav agitators from the Yugoslav Embassy in France, and those on the list who were in France were either monitored or deported. Many Yugoslavs with a record of bad behavior were arrested yesterday, and the contacts of other foreigners were also monitored. The precautions were very strict. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Assassin's Passport Forged Belgrade It was said that there were demonstrations in Saragosa and Chaegribai today against the assassin of the King and the French foreign minister, Karmen, and that public calls for Italy's name were dispersed by the police, and it has now been proven that the assassin's passport was forged, and was never presented to the Czech consul in Chaegribai, and that an unemployed youth, Vavorina, was arrested in the Czech capital yesterday for having a passport with the same number as the assassin's passport, and it is said that he lost the passport, and the public initially thought he might have sold it to the forgery agency, but the police later stated that Vavurina's passport was in the possession of the government, and it was proved that Vavurina was innocent, and Karmen's passport was indeed forged (Reuters, 11th).</p>
<p>Tattoo of a Skull on His Arm The "Political Newspaper" correspondent in Marseille, the capital of Yugoslavia, reported that he witnessed the assassin's left arm tattooed with the letters VMRO, a skull, and the words "Freedom and Death" in Bulgarian. Since the assassin's passport was forged, the unimaginable pattern tattooed on his arm was probably deliberately designed to mislead and prevent investigation. According to general opinion here, the assassin was not a member of the Macedonian Revolutionary Party of Bulgaria, but a member of the terrorist "Ustasas" party of Yugoslavia. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital The assassin of King Alexander, Carlman, has not yet been identified, and three people with the surname Carlman have been arrested, but it has been proven that they are indeed good people, and they have been released. A Spaniard named Carlman in the Zagreb area set off for Marseilles on October 6, and on October 9 he received a telegram in Marseilles, King Alexander</p>
<p>was undoubtedly using a code, and this person has not yet been found, and there are no traces of him in Marseilles or the Bulgarian capital. The assassin Carlman's false passport, which was obtained on May 30 of this year, was rumored yesterday to have been issued by the Czech consul in the city of Zagreb, but it has now been determined that this is not true, as the consul was not in the city of Zagreb at that time. In short, the assassin's passport is a Czech passport, his name is similar to that of a Hungarian, and his place of birth is Croatian, so the investigation is extremely complex. The assassin's left arm is tattooed with (the letters VMRO and a human skull). The newness of the tattoos is now being investigated, and if they are new tattoos, they must be to confuse people and make investigation difficult. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Important Discoveries in the Hotel (Paris) The police investigation into the Marseille assassination has made several important discoveries. It is learned that the assassin and another Yugoslavian arrived in Paris on September 30 and stayed in a small hotel on Massalen Street. One signed the name Rudolf Szek, born in 1899 in Trieste, and the other signed the name Fulavoslav Pennasch, born in 1903 in Tsaraszek, which is undoubtedly the alias of the chief assassin, Kelman. Szek and Pennasch shared a room and met daily with another Yugoslavian named Maris, a well-known troublemaker who had committed several crimes. The three then went to Aix-en-Provence in southern France and stayed at the Modern Hotel. The hotel owner confirmed that the Marseille assassin was one of them. One of the three left the hotel on Monday morning, while the other two read various newspapers in the hotel. After breakfast, the two went out and returned to the hotel in the evening to pay their bills and collect their luggage, saying that they were in a hurry to leave due to some commercial relations. The police are now fully investigating the other two people who were with the assassin. Kelman was undoubtedly a revolutionary and the mastermind of the assassination. The group had sufficient funds, as the assassin used an automatic submachine gun worth 2,000 francs. The other pistol found on the assassin was also a state-of-the-art weapon of considerable value. The police have now searched the nests of Yugoslavian revolutionary groups in Paris, and French Foreign Minister Barthou</p>
<p>has arrested four people, including Radic, the son of the Croatian national leader who was shot and killed in the Yugoslavian parliament three years ago. There is no evidence to date that the four are related to the Marseille assassination. The police seized many documents, which are now under investigation. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Accomplices Apprehended on the French-Swiss Border (Paris) Two suspects, Pinishu and Novac, were apprehended today at a certain hotel in Solen for conspiring with the assassin of the Southern King, Carlman. It is said that one of them confessed that if the assassination in Marseille had failed, they would have attempted it in Paris. The two were apparently planning to board a ship to Geneva and enter Switzerland (Reuters, 11th).</p>

<p>Marseille - The coffin of King Alexander of the Southern Kingdom was carried aboard the cruiser "Dubrovnik" today for transport back to his country. First, French General Souchet and seven officers paid their final respects to the remains and played the national anthems of the Southern Kingdom and France. The procession then started from the Provincial Government Office in a somber atmosphere and passed through various thoroughfares to reach the wharf. A armored car full of wreaths led the way, followed by the coffin. President Lebrun, Queen Marie, the royal family of the Southern Kingdom, and the two ministers of the unrestrained cabinet, Herriot and Taitio, walked along carrying the shroud. Many people walked silently, following the procession. After the coffin arrived at the wharf, several Yugoslav officers carried the coffin onto the warship. Everyone present was silent for one minute. At 4:30 PM, the "Dubrovnik" set sail for the Southern Kingdom, escorted by two French cruisers and two destroyers. The Italian naval attaché in France recently inquired with the Navy Department about the time the "Dubrovnik" would pass through the Strait of Messina in Italy, saying that the Italian Navy would send warships to pay respects to the remains of the Southern King at that time. The French government has decided to close all schools in the country for one day this Saturday to commemorate the mourning of the two countries. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>Marseille - This was the King's first official visit since the war, and the French side had made great efforts to arrange a particularly warm welcome. The purpose of his visit to France was to discuss important political events, to strengthen the friendship between France and the South, and to ease the tense relations between Italy and the South, which was a key point of this visit. To avoid passing through Austrian and Italian territory, the King embarked on a warship, and the French fleet and naval aircraft in the Mediterranean Sea all greeted him in Marseille, and the French naval chief personally greeted him at the pier. It was agreed that they would take a special train to Paris, while the Queen, unaccustomed to the rough seas, would travel by land and meet him in Paris. Unexpectedly, shortly after arriving in Marseille, this tragedy occurred. Crown Prince Peter, who is only eleven years old, is currently studying at Cobham School in Surrey, England. He will not be informed of this bad news for the time being, but will be notified after receiving official instructions.</p>
<p>The London diplomatic community was deeply shocked by this bad news, as the King was a key figure in maintaining peace in the Balkans. The fact that relations in various aspects of the Balkans are better today than before is due to the King's unremitting efforts. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<p>According to the driver of the King's car, as the car approached the stock exchange, a strong man suddenly rushed out of the crowd, climbed onto the fender of the car, and fired four or five shots at the King and Barthou. He immediately grabbed his neck, and Colonel Pilot, who was riding alongside the car, also struck the man with his saber. Colonel Pilot described the situation to the Reuters reporter as follows:</p>
<p>"As the car carrying the King and Barthou approached the stock exchange, I saw a man rush out of the crowd, cross the police on the side of the street, and gallop to my horse. He jumped onto the fender of the car. I quickly spurred my horse to chase him, but it was too late. The man reached his arm through the window and fired an automatic pistol at the King. I knocked him down with my saber. The assassin rolled around on the ground, still firing his gun. The driver of the car also fired back with his pistol (Reuters, 10th).</p>

<p>Three Regents Appointed in Accordance with the Late King's Will</p>
<p>Future Policy Said to Be Shifting Towards Pro-British Stance</p>
<p>Belgrade – Just hours after receiving the official report from Paris late last night that King Alexander had been assassinated in Marseille, Crown Prince Peter, now eleven years old, was announced to have inherited the throne of Yugoslavia, a fact which came as a surprise, as it had been declared by Paris last night that the Crown Prince's succession would not be announced until several days later. The declaration of accession was based on Article 36 of the Constitution, and the new monarch was designated Peter II, and a regency was immediately established to handle state affairs until the new monarch came of age. The candidates were Prince Paul, the King's uncle, former Minister of Education Stegko Fovke, and Governor Polovich of Seff Province. Before dawn this morning, members of the cabinet and naval and military officers solemnly swore allegiance to King Peter II by torchlight. The cabinet then held a simple meeting and announced a six-month period of national mourning. News from London said that King Peter arrived in Gotham at 8:40 this morning and immediately changed cars to move forward, his whereabouts kept strictly secret (National Telegram, 10th).</p>
<p>Belgrade - King Alexander of Yugoslavia foresaw that the monarchs of Serbia rarely ended well, so he stated in his will that if he died and his son was still in school, the Crown Prince must return home to attend the funeral and then return to England to continue his studies. However, it is doubtful whether Peter, who is now supposed to succeed his father, will be able to return to England, as according to the Constitution, the King of Yugoslavia must reside in the country permanently. The Regency will today strive to form a strong government of national unity and gain the support of the people. There are no prominent politicians among the Regency, and they are welcomed as they have no partisan conspiracies (Reuters, 11th).</p>
<p>Belgrade - The Senate and House of Representatives held a joint meeting today to swear allegiance to the new king. The policy of the new regency will be friendly towards Britain, as the leader of the regency is approximately Prince Stanley Kavic, the former Minister of Education, who studied at Oxford University and has long advocated the British-style civil rule (Reuters, 10th).</p>

<p>(Paris) The new monarch of the South has now arrived in Paris (Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Belgrade - This morning, the newspapers published a formal announcement that Crown Prince Peter had succeeded to the throne of Yugoslavia. The new King, who was studying at Cobham School in Surrey, England, is hurrying back to the capital. The army and navy have sworn allegiance to the new monarch. The late King Alexander had ordered in his will that the former Minister of Education, Prince Stanley Kavic, and the Governor of Chai Koli White Province, Bantrovic, should organize the Regency.</p>
<p>This morning at 6:00 AM, the new King was urged by his Chief of Staff to quickly dress and see the headmaster. When he arrived at the headmaster's office, he was told the bad news. He hurriedly ate breakfast and, accompanied by his teacher and a detective, took a car to London, his face pale and his expression frightened, wearing a dark flannel suit and a school cap. At 9:00 AM, he arrived at the Yugoslav Embassy, where he saw the flagpole flying at half-mast, and was visibly abashed. Last night, due to the lack of official news and instructions, the news of his father's death was not immediately told to him (Reuters, 10th).</p>
<p>(London) When the headmaster told King Peter of Yugoslavia this morning that his father had died and that he had been crowned as the new King, his first words were, "I want to see my mother." The new King, who is only eleven years old, seemed very surprised to suddenly shoulder the heavy responsibility of a monarch. The new King, under strict police protection, traveled by car at a speed of 70 miles per hour, arriving at the Southern Embassy in London early this morning. He then met with several ambassadors and ministers from various countries in the embassy. British Foreign Secretary Simon also went to pay his respects and condolences. At noon, he went to Rich with his grandmother, Queen Mary, for lunch. At 2:00 PM, they went to Paris together. When boarding the car, the new King wanted to help his grandmother in first, but the Queen, because her grandson was now a monarch, let him board first. In the car, the new King took off his hat and stuffed it in the corner of the car. The Queen put her arm around him, as if to comfort him. At that time, the new monarch of Yugoslavia</p>
<p>did not know that his father had been assassinated, but thought that he had died in an accident. The train that the new King and Queen Mary were riding in was the ordinary Golden Arrow, but there was also a special car filled with police officers, escorting them to Dover, and there were military police patrolling the route. Detectives accompanied the new King on board, escorting him to Calais, France, and entrusting the responsibility of protection to the French police. France also sent several police officers to Dover to accompany the new King's ship across the English Channel (Reuters, 10th).</p>

<p>Yugoslav Border Demonstrations</p>
<p>Italian Consulate Staff Member Beaten</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the Associated Press correspondent’s interview this morning with Washington diplomats, the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia may incite international disputes. Some European countries' representatives are deeply fearful of the Croat ethnic group's attempts to secede from Serbia and become independent, fearing this matter will cause serious consequences. Diplomats say that most Italians sympathize with the Croat nationalist faction, while France advocates for the unity of the Croat ethnic group and the Serbians. Some quarters worry that the assassinations of King Alexander of Yugoslavia and French Foreign Minister Barthou will seriously impact the preliminary talks of the future London Naval Conference. Well-informed sources believe that the balance of power in the Mediterranean will disintegrate from this point forward. Britain is especially concerned about this, and the United States is also affected because the U.S. Navy insists on parity with Britain. The U.S. naval authorities hoped that Barthou could have persuaded King Alexander to agree to a French-Italian compromise to reconcile the naval competition between France and Italy, thereby reducing the pressure on Britain and preventing Britain from building more warships. (10th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Belgrade: Public sentiment is highly agitated towards Italy. Today, riots against Italian officials and civilians occurred in the Leitha Banat area, which is only a few miles away from the Italian border. An official from the Italian consulate stationed in the city, upon seeing local residents holding anti-Italian demonstrations, attempted to stop them but was severely beaten by the angry crowd, sustaining serious injuries. During the beating, the crowd shouted, "Down with Italy!" Diplomatic circles here tonight indicated that this matter will become a case for negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia. (11th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Belgrade: After the assassination of King Alexander, the entire country was shocked. In some places, people were initially grief-stricken and then turned to anger. Demonstrations were held in Zagreb and Ljubljana, expressing animosity towards Italy and Hungary. Local Italian and Hungarian consuls received special protection, and fortunately, no incidents occurred. There were also demonstrations in Sarajevo. Some people were hostile to Italy, while others were hostile to Catholicism, in other words, hostility towards Croats. (10th Havas News Agency)</p>

<p>French Newspapers Also Offer Much Criticism</p>
<p>Political Turmoil Likely to Ensue</p>
<p>Belgrade: People here believe that the king's assassination was largely due to the lack of efficiency of French policing, so they are quite dissatisfied with France. At the same time, French newspapers also have severe criticisms of French policing and trace the secret collusion between police officers and gangsters. The Paris Midi newspaper said that the panicked atmosphere of the Marseille police on Tuesday was almost indescribable. Marseille is a place where foreign fugitives and other unscrupulous people gather, yet it allowed the Yugoslav king to land in Marseille. Is this not outrageous? French newspapers unanimously advocated for severe punishment of those responsible, and the Minister of the Interior, Sarraut, should also be punished. Several newspapers also demanded that the government resign to allow for reorganization. The French government has decided to conduct a thorough and open investigation of this matter, which newspapers welcomed. The assassination of French President Doumer by a Russian occurred the year before last, and now the Yugoslav king has been assassinated by a Croat, so the call for cracking down on foreign residents in France is now stronger, and the clamor for improving policing is also rampant. Last night, there were demonstrations on the streets of Paris, shouting slogans against the police. Several members of parliament have now expressed their intention to impeach the government due to this incident. During the period of mourning for Barthou, the French cabinet is unlikely to undergo any changes, but it is expected that there will be two possible solutions: (1) Prime Minister Doumergue will invite Herriot or someone else to take the post of Foreign Minister to maintain the integrity of the cabinet; (2) Minister of Justice Chéron and Minister of the Interior Sarraut, who have recently been criticized for deficiencies in judicial and police affairs, may resign.

<p>(Paris) The news of the death of the assassinated King of Yugoslavia spread here, and people were inexplicably shocked. The municipal authorities had originally prepared to receive the King with solemn ceremonies after his arrival in the capital. Now, upon hearing the tragic news, they were inexpressibly saddened. All public institutions flew flags at half-mast to express their condolences. Queen Marie of Yugoslavia was traveling by train from Basel, Switzerland, on a special train to France. According to the time, she should have arrived in Besançon in the Doubs region, where the governor of the province will go to meet her and inform her of the tragic news. President Lebrun is scheduled to go to Marseille in the evening to pay his respects to the remains of Alexander and Barthou. (9th Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Doumergue will announce the tragic news of the Yugoslav king to the people of the whole country. The text has been approved by the cabinet and will be posted everywhere tomorrow.

Unexpectedly, he was tragically murdered upon landing. The French government deeply mourns this, and on behalf of the people, the government expresses its condolences to the Queen of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav government, and the Yugoslav people. King Alexander of Yugoslavia and Foreign Minister Barthou both died from their injuries. Both countries have suffered tragedy. Their feelings and thoughts "will be closer and united." The government has decided to order the army, navy, and air force to observe a month of mourning. During this period, all banquets and ceremonies will be suspended to express condolences. Barthou will be given a state funeral. (9th Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Paris) Yugoslav Prime Minister Uzunović, due to the tragic death of Foreign Minister Barthou, has offered condolences to Prime Minister Doumergue and French Ambassador to Yugoslavia, de Négrier. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić, who accompanied the late King Alexander to France, said that Barthou died for Yugoslavia. The newspapers in the capital published the tragic news of the King and Barthou, expressing shock and outrage. All newspapers, regardless of party affiliation, condemned the assassination with stern words and righteous indignation, saying that peace-loving countries would all be adversely affected. (10th Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers criticized this incident with particular sorrow and indignation, saying that no foreign monarch has ever been killed in French territory. The assassin was only one person, and his political prejudices are well known, so there is no reason to fear international disputes. The Paris Matin newspaper said that Barthou's advocacy of Franco-Italian rapprochement and the plan for Italian-Yugoslav rapprochement must continue. Italian newspapers expressed praise and condolences for both the Yugoslav king and French Foreign Minister Barthou. Newspapers around the world expressed sympathy for the French and Yugoslav governments, but all asked, "What will happen now?" Critics generally said that this incident was a serious warning to Europe, showing that world unrest must be eliminated as soon as possible. (10th Reuters News Agency)</p>

He also telegraphed Xiao Jirong, China's chargé d'affaires in France, instructing him to express condolences to the Yugoslav king for the unfortunate incident of Alexander. Because China and Yugoslavia have not yet established treaty relations, he did not directly telegraph the Yugoslav government. (11th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) British Home Secretary Gilmour spoke today in Crayford, mentioning European issues and hinting that Britain will increase its military strength. He said that the deaths of King Alexander of Yugoslavia and French Foreign Minister Barthou were a major blow to the maintenance of European peace. The British government has always disliked war. Since the armistice, Britain has set a model for the world in terms of arms reduction. Now, after observing all circumstances, the authorities must make some additions in terms of military strength at this time. After the Japanese naval representatives arrive in Britain next week, the government will consult with them on everything. He also said that the livelihoods of many people in Britain are tied to trade with China, so Britain should have a sufficient fleet stationed at sea. (10th Reuters News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) British morning newspapers have all commented on the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia. In addition to lamenting his tragic death and praising his achievements, many said that the situation in the Balkans was already very complicated, and now the death of the Yugoslav king will cause even more new twists and turns. The Times said that the King's virtue and spirit of governance had gradually made the Croat people submit, and the rise of Germany and the threat to Austria's independence had made the Croat people less divided. Unexpectedly, the King could not avoid a tragic death. In general, Yugoslav foreign policy has always been in the hands of the King. Now that he has suffered misfortune, there are more hidden worries about the future. The Daily Telegraph reported that important negotiations were about to begin, but the King was assassinated, so his vision of achieving a better understanding between France, Italy, and Yugoslavia could not be realized, which is regrettable. (10th Reuters News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) General criticism in Geneva regarding the Marseille tragedy holds that few assassinations could cause more international harm than the assassination of King Alexander. The attempt to improve relations between Italy and Yugoslavia is now feared to be a pipe dream. But one thing that can make people feel slightly comforted is that the King's assassination cannot be blamed on Italy. The New York Times' commentary also stated that the assassin of the Yugoslav king was one of the people expelled from the country by the King, so this matter can eliminate the fear of conflict between Italy and Yugoslavia. Berlin opinion believes that German-Yugoslav cooperation has long been a key point of Germany's efforts, as this would allow Germany to break through the encirclement. Now that the Yugoslav King has been assassinated, whether the plan for German-Yugoslav cooperation will be relaxed is a cause for great concern. Germany has recently had a trend of seeking closer understanding with Yugoslavia. Although the progress has been slow, it has been steadily advancing. The legislation used has mostly been economic concessions, but there may be changes in the future. The British royal family has decided to observe mourning until October 22. Only the wedding of Prince George and Princess Marina of Greece will not be affected. Members of the royal family, such as the Duke of Connaught and many diplomats, visited the Queen of Romania this morning to offer their condolences, as the Queen is the grandmother of the new monarch of Yugoslavia.

<p>Rome: The news of the assassination of French Foreign Minister Barthou in Marseille spread here, and the Italian people were shocked beyond words. Barthou worked hard for the European peace movement and was scheduled to come here soon to complete his peace work. Unexpectedly, he was tragically murdered. This is what everyone regrets. Political figures said that Barthou was able to solve European problems that were generally considered difficult to solve, and his excellence is deeply admired. The relations between Italy and France, from the current situation, have a great hope of improving. If Barthou went to Italy and shook hands with Mussolini, the friendship between Italy and France would not be difficult to restore to intimacy. This is what people were looking forward to, but now it has turned out like this, how can we not be saddened? (9th Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Rome: News of the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia in Marseille, France, has shocked and angered the Italian people. Although the relations between Yugoslavia and Italy have sometimes been tense, the character of the Yugoslav King has always been admired by the general public. Moreover, Prime Minister Mussolini's speech in Milan recently mainly expressed Italy's willingness to reconcile with Yugoslavia. Therefore, immediately after the Milan speech, there were rumors that the two countries were engaged in rapprochement work to echo Mussolini's words, and the preparation of Italian public opinion to clarify relations between the two countries is also undeniable. At this time, the tragic news of the King suddenly came, which is why everyone deeply regrets it. (9th Havas News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e59">Brief History of the Yugoslav King <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Ruler of Three Ethnic Groups: King Alexander of Yugoslavia was the second son of King Peter I of Serbia. After the establishment of the unified state of the three ethnic groups of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, he was crowned as the new monarch. His mother was the daughter of King Nicholas of Montenegro. King Alexander married the second daughter of King Ferdinand of Romania in June 1922 and had three sons. The King's task of ruling a new country composed of three ethnic groups was not easy. In addition, few of the ministers left by his father were friends and many were enemies, which made it even more difficult. According to the royal family's history, it was founded by his great-grandfather George. In 1804, George raised the banner of rebellion in Serbia and succeeded in resisting Turkey. From 1804 to 1813, he became the leader of the Serbian people. In 1903, his grandson Peter became king, and in 1921, he died, and his son, Crown Prince Alexander, succeeded him. Alexander had been regent since 1914, but he was not crowned until 1933.</p>
<p>Military Career: Alexander studied in Geneva and then at the Peter the Great Military Academy in St. Petersburg. After returning to his country, he applied what he had learned and served the country. From 1914 to 1918, he was almost always on the battlefield. During the first and second Balkan Wars, he repeatedly made military achievements as an ordinary soldier. During the European War, he always served as the commander-in-chief of the Serbian army. In 1915, the Serbian army suffered a disastrous defeat and retreated through Albania. Alexander refused to abandon his soldiers and save himself, willing to share their hardships, which revived morale. The King was brave and good at fighting, strong and enduring, inheriting the traits of his father and being resourceful and strategic, with much of the style of his maternal grandfather, King Nicholas of Montenegro, who was known as the "old fox" of the Balkans.</p>
<p>Exercising Absolute Power: King Alexander gradually eliminated his political enemies and implemented strict centralism, which made him unpopular. Because politicians and leaders of various factions were constantly fighting for power, he resolutely abolished the constitution on January 6, 1929, and implemented military rule, with his close friend General Živković serving as dictator. The government was only responsible to the King, with the aim of eliminating ethnic and historical differences among the people.</p>
<p>On November 7, 1929, he ordered the renaming of the country to Yugoslavia, which means "South Slavia." On October 3, 1931, the King promulgated a new constitution, nominally democratic, but in reality, the power was still in his hands.</p>
<p>Unity of Three Countries: In recent years, the King has made every effort to cooperate with Romania and Czechoslovakia in order to consolidate Yugoslavia's position in the Balkans. These three countries are known as the Little Entente. The meeting in Silezia in September 1933 was an important action to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Brave and Skilled in Battle: The King's anecdotes are well-known among the people. In June 1915, when retreating through Albania, the monarch and government officials all boarded the first ship to flee to France. The King alone refused to leave, despite the danger of dying from artillery fire or being captured by the enemy, and calmly directed the troops to retreat to a safe place, which greatly enhanced his reputation. In early 1915, when Belgrade was abandoned, the government issued a strict order that no one was allowed to return to the capital, because the Allied forces were bombarding the main roads, and those who entered could not protect themselves. At that time, a car carrying two officers was stopped by the guards and ordered to retreat. One of the officers was King Alexander, who did not comply and still ventured to Belgrade, completed his important task, and returned to the Nish headquarters. Although the King was brave, he was also superstitious, like many old soldiers. He never dealt with political affairs on Tuesdays or Fridays. Whenever making major national decisions, he would go to the church built by King Peter in Topola at night and pray all night before his father's tomb.</p>
<p>Discord Among Brothers: The King's treatment of his brother George was widely criticized. During the European War, George made outstanding military achievements and was highly respected, but the King used party leaders as tools to implicate George in crimes. In 1924, he took the opportunity to place George in a private mental asylum near Nish, under heavy guard. It is said that George was harshly treated in the asylum.</p>

<p>(Paris) The late Foreign Minister Barthou (surname), Louis (given name), was born in 1862. He studied in Pau as a child, and his grades were always the best in his class. At that time, Barthou was already fascinated by politics. He later graduated from the Faculty of Law at the University of Bordeaux and practiced law there. He then went to Paris for further studies, finally obtaining a doctorate in 1886. His two dissertations were widely praised. In 1888, Barthou served as a member of the Pau Municipal Council. The following year, he was elected as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. Later, he was transferred to the Senate for each joint election. In 1894, Barthou was only 32 years old when he became Minister of Public Works. He later served as Minister of the Interior and Minister of Justice, and in 1913, he formed a cabinet and served as Prime Minister. During the European War, his son was killed in battle. Barthou was deeply saddened and did not ask about political affairs. Later, at the urging of the late Prime Minister Painlevé, he joined the War Committee of the Cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio. After the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, the Chamber of Deputies passed the treaty based on Barthou's report. Since then, Barthou has held important positions in the cabinet and played an important role in domestic politics. For example, the law restoring the three-year term of military service, which was passed by the National Assembly when the European War was about to break out, was largely due to Barthou's efforts. Barthou was not only a politician but also a great orator, and he wrote many books on law and history. In 1918, he was elected to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres.

<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Barthou was tragically assassinated in Marseille yesterday. Barthou was a leader in the French political world. He was first a member of the Chamber of Deputies in 1889, and then served as a cabinet member and other important positions before becoming Prime Minister. In 1922, he was re-elected as a senator. Barthou's most successful period was in the first year after the war. He represented France in negotiating difficult war debt issues, so Barthou was one of the most familiar with war debt issues. Barthou was born in Oloron-Sainte-Marie, near the Spanish border. He earned a doctorate in law and practiced law in Paris. He wrote about ten books in his lifetime, none of which were particularly good, but he was promoted to the French Academy for this and enjoyed immortal fame. Barthou had a rich collection of books. In 1894, Barthou was Minister of Public Works, and two years later, he was Minister of the Interior. He then served as Minister of Justice twice. In 1913, he overthrew Briand and became Prime Minister. He was later overthrown by Doumergue. Barthou belonged to the left wing. After serving as Foreign Minister in the current cabinet, he became a political leader in all of Europe. (10th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chairman Chiang completed his public affairs in Hankou and was originally scheduled to go to Zhengzhou with Zhang Xueliang on the evening of the 8th, then transfer to Luoyang to attend the opening ceremony of the second phase of the Luoyang Military Branch School on Double Ten Day. Later, it was changed to the morning of the 9th. On the evening of the 8th, Chiang telegraphed from the executive headquarters in Jiangxi, summoning Luo Zhuoying, commander of the 18th Army, to Hankou to inquire about the situation of bandit suppression in Jiangxi Province. On the morning of the 9th, at 8:00 AM, Luo arrived by plane. After Chairman Chiang met him, he took a car and went north. Earlier, the Pinghan Railway Bureau had prepared a special train, parked at the Dazhimen Railway Station with the fire lit, and there was an armored car leading the way. At around 8:00 AM, Zhang Xueliang led his entourage, including advisor Duan Na, Chief of Staff Tan Hai, and Secretary-General of Chiang's Headquarters Yang Yongtai, secretaries Mao Qingxiang, Luo Junqiang, Chen Fang, director Yan Daogang, and Chief of Staff Xuan Tiewu, to board the train first. He Chengjun, Zhang Qun, Xu Yuanquan, Wu Xingya, Chen Guangzu, Ye Peng, Guo Rudong, Ding Bingquan, Huang Gongzhu, Wang Shaoyu, Zeng Qingxi, Tao Yaojie, Yang Xingqin, Wu Shaoshu, Li Jihong, Zhou Zechun, Chen Xizeng, Cai Mengjian and other important party, government, and military figures were all at the station to see them off. Military security was extremely tight. At 9:30 AM, Chairman Chiang boarded the train and immediately headed north. Zhang Xueliang told reporters before leaving that Chairman Chiang also served as the principal of the Luoyang Military Officer Branch School, and he served as a member. The opening ceremony of the second phase, after preparations by Education Director Ni Shaozhou, was scheduled to be held on Double Ten Day. He followed Chairman Chiang to participate and would not stay in Luoyang for long before returning to Hankou. He Yingqin, Chairman of the Peiping Military Branch, took a train south from Peiping on the 7th, originally planning to come to Hankou to visit Chairman Chiang and report on the military situation in North China. Upon learning that Chairman Chiang was about to go north, he changed his plans to visit him in Zhengzhou. Therefore, after arriving in Zhengzhou last night, He did not come south. Liu Zhi, director of the Henan Pacification Headquarters, also arrived in Bian yesterday to meet him and will go to Luoyang together. (October 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Li Zongren Will Return to Guangxi <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Guangxi Army Pursues and Suppresses Xiao's Bandits in Guizhou</p>
<p>Wang and You Cooperate Again in Guizhou Province</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Li Zongren, commander-in-chief of the Fourth Group Army of Guangxi Province, went to Hong Kong on the 27th of last month to visit Hu Hanmin and discuss the overall situation. On the 3rd of this month, he returned to Guangzhou with his adjutant Qiu Chang. After breakfast at his private residence, he went to Chen Jitang's private residence in Meihua Village for a confidential talk for an hour. In the afternoon at 1:00 PM, Li and Chen went to the Southwest Political Affairs Council one after another to have a lengthy discussion with Xiao Focheng, Zou Lu, Deng Zhiru, and others until about 3:00 PM. It is said that Li is scheduled to return to Guangxi during the day and will meet with Bai Chongxi in Nanning. Bai had set off to the Liuzhou and Guilin areas to inspect defense affairs because the Guangxi army entered Guizhou to pursue and suppress Xiao's bandits. According to a recent telegram from Liao Lei, commander of the Guangxi army, Xiao's bandits were defeated in Menghai by the Li and Zhou divisions and attempted to flee northeast across Wang Bridge, but were intercepted by Wang Tuanming's battalion. Their situation was dire, and they fled back to Bagua River. Two regiments of the Guangxi army pursued and suppressed them toward Bagua River on the 26th of last month. The bandits were terrified and, after a brief encounter, fled to Daguan. The 2,000 to 3,000 people left in Banxi first fled to Daguan and were intercepted head-on by the Qin Division and the Independent Regiment and Cheng Brigade, killing three to four hundred bandits. The bandits in Bagua River were pursued by the Wang and Zhang regiments and fled in two routes from Banxi to Liangshang, with a tendency to flee north. In addition to sending the Qin Division to pursue and suppress them, the Guangxi army also moved the Li and Zhou divisions westward. Wang Jialie of the Guizhou army led his troops to Zhenyuan to block the river. From Bagua River to Pingliu, a two-day journey, many wounded bandits were abandoned along the way, and luggage and other items were everywhere. If they were severely attacked once or twice more, Xiao's entire bandit force could be disintegrated. According to the telegram, Bai said that Xiao's remaining forces had fled north. Once the inspection of military affairs in Liuzhou and Guilin was completed, he would return to Nanning to wait for Li Zongren. Bai has been paying close attention to Guizhou affairs recently. In addition to sending troops to assist Wang Jialie in attacking Xiao's bandits from both sides, he also advocated that the internal unity and solidarity of Guizhou Province should be unified as soon as possible to jointly defend against the Red bandits. Therefore, Wang has recently sent personnel to contact You Guocai. You also telegraphed Wang on the 26th of last month, expressing his sincerity in cooperation. Wang then personally went to Zhenyuan to command the bandit suppression and appointed You as the director of the Civil Affairs Department, acting as chairman of the provincial government. You has agreed to go to the province alone to discuss major plans. Yesterday, he also telegraphed Bai Chongxi, expressing his gratitude for his assistance in suppressing Xiao's bandits. Bai replied to You's telegram, saying, "Commander You of Xingyi, Yong Nong brother, Jian Dong, and Brother Deyi forwarded your telegram. I have read it carefully. The Red bandits are wreaking havoc in Guizhou, and the disaster is deepening. My brother loves the country and his hometown and can see the big picture. He goes to the province alone, openly and honestly, and befriends Lian Po and Lin Xiangru. This is a good story for thousands of years. Your magnanimous demeanor is admirable. In the future, we will cooperate in planning and seek major plans together. This is the fortune of Guizhou Province and the blessing of the Southwest. Bai Chongxi bows." (October 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Xu Yongchang Talks About Controlled Economy in Shanxi Province <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>| To Save the Rural Areas, We Must Use Domestic Goods |</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: Xu Yongchang, chairman of Shanxi Province, came to Peiping a few days ago to attend the fifth general meeting of the Political Consolidation Committee. Today (October 9th), according to Xu, "I plan to suppress bandits because I still have private affairs to settle." (October 9th) He will stay in Peiping for more than ten days before returning to Taiyuan. Shanxi Province has implemented a controlled economy in recent years. The so-called control is actually just statistical work and a thorough investigation of the province's industries. Because various places are currently advocating saving the rural areas and revitalizing industry and commerce, we must know that to save the rural areas, we must first cultivate the people's strength. However, the first thing to do to cultivate the people's strength is to encourage the use of domestic goods. Therefore, the main purpose is to provide local products for local people to use. Since the Shanxi-Suiyuan Army implemented the disbandment, it can save 190,000 yuan per month. The head of the cabinet is still living in Hebian Village, serving the old man and recuperating from illness. Sun Dianying is still living in Jinci and is in good condition. Teams have been sent to Shenmu and Fugu to assist in suppressing bandits.</p>
<p>Northwest Inspection Notes by our special correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<h3 id="e76">A General Description of the Life of the Tibetan People in Qinghai (Part 2) <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The language of the Tibetan people is entirely Tibetan. Although the tones vary due to the mountains and rivers in different regions, they are generally all from the same lineage of Tibetan. Among them, the Lhasa language is more popular and commonly used. Because the lamas in each temple all use the Tibetan script (i.e., Tibetan script), and there are no schools for education, those in the countryside who are literate rely on entering temples to recite scriptures. Therefore, all the text is purely Tibetan. Provincial and county announcements and official documents must also be in both Chinese and Tibetan. It is said that the British have established churches and hospitals all over Tibet, with attached schools, widely collecting children of the Tibetan people, imparting considerable science, and establishing a Tibetan military school in India, with a grand scale and complete teaching. All lecture notes are translated from English into Tibetan, and those who are proficient in Tibetan are used as professors. The depth and toxicity of their intentions is truly chilling.</p>
<p>The Tibetan people's hobbies, regardless of men, women, old or young, lamas and monks, all love tobacco and alcohol. Tobacco, such as snuff, dry tobacco, and water tobacco, is common everywhere. Cigarettes are also becoming popular, but no Tibetan people smoke opium. This is truly a good phenomenon. When relaxing and drinking, they like to listen to the Tibetan version of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." Those who can read or recite this book are welcomed everywhere. In addition, because of the special social organization, young men and women often spend their rose-colored love lives freely in the green meadows. Therefore, the gentle and clear singing, like mournful and longing tunes, is like spring dawn in a flower-filled valley, with birds chirping in disorder. When travelers hear it, they have a sense of "I feel deeply about this." A few selected translated love songs are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The daughters of the nobles are like peach pits, but even the peaches on tall trees will ripen one day. (2) When the flowers have bloomed, the bees don't have to worry. When the love relationship is cut off, what is there to grieve about? (3) The love geese by the shallow water are willing to linger here for a long time. When the ice is firm and the lake is frozen, they have to fly resolutely to the horizon. (4) Take the beautiful flowers and offer them to the Buddha. The hummingbirds that depend on each other day and night also fly to other people's halls. (5) The supreme Buddha image, although I try hard to silently remember it, still doesn't enter my mind. But her graceful figure is always vaguely in front of my eyes. (6) If I use my sincere and earnest heart for you to learn Buddhism, why worry about not reaching the Western Paradise in this life? (Those who are deeply trapped in the net of love and cannot get out of it should read this and be awakened.) (7) My dear, will you be with me for a long time? She said, "Unless death separates us, we will never leave each other." (8) Obeying her psychology, I also sacrificed my Buddhist relationship. If I resolutely enter the mountains to practice, I will violate her wishes. (This contradictory phenomenon of not forgetting love when practicing Buddhism and not forgetting Buddhism when in love is not unique to Tibetan youth.) (9) When the pearl was in my house, I didn't know it was so precious. Now that it has been lost to others, its omnipotence is revealed. (10) If I can accompany my beloved in my heart for a long journey, then I will feel happy on the road even if my feet are not wearing shoes. (11) The full chest of melancholy is not enough to tell outsiders, fearing that the enemy will be happy and the lover will be sad. (12) You, my beloved who descended from the upper realm like a bean flower, I not only ask to live with you in this life, but also wish that we will spend the next life together.</p>
<p>There are many popular proverbs and idioms among the Tibetan people. A few examples are listed below. (1) I won't share, and you won't take. (That is, not giving even a small thing to others and not taking anything from others.) (2) When it rains, the road is not good. When you drink, people are not good. (3) A smart person wakes up with a word, and a good horse gallops away with a whip. (4) Many mouths have no doors, and there are no doors at crossroads. (That is, it is not easy to prevent mouths, and it is easy to enter a wrong path.) (5) As long as you eat venison, even if you are thin, don't worry too much. As long as you drink Songpan tea (tea produced in Songpan, which the Tibetan people like most), even if there is no butter tea, don't worry too much.</p>
<p>Because of the differences in customs, languages, and writing among the Tibetan people in Qinghai, and because they have not been effectively implemented with special politics and effective education, the officials who have been appointed to govern them have always disregarded the laws of the country. Moreover, the free laws they use to restrain violence and behavior are often unreasonable. For example, if there is hatred between two tribes, A suddenly sends someone to attack B and seize B's cattle, sheep, and property. A kidnaps the people and waits for ransom. But if B is prepared, kills the person sent by A, A will lead the people to besiege B and send the so-called "village elders" eight people to ask B to compensate for the loss of life. B knows that he is in the wrong and cannot resist, so he is willing to compensate for life. First, he gives the blocking soldiers property and gifts of one or two hundred gold, or several horses, and asks A to lift the siege, and then discusses the price of life. For example, the fine of ninety-nine eighty-one means that for each human life, Mao cattle, hybrid cattle, castrated sheep, yellow cattle, stallion horses, mares, camels, donkeys, and mules should each be compensated with nine heads. If B's power is strong and fights against A, and there are deaths and injuries on both sides, after mediation by C, another tribe, if A dies eight people and B dies ten people, then A should compensate B for two lives, and pay the financial gift as usual as above. In addition, if A and B have no previous grievances, but a person from A privately robs from B and is killed, the compensation must also be paid as usual. Moreover, the amount of compensation is not the responsibility of the murderer alone, but is shared by all the people. Therefore, the Tibetan people like to rob and kill, which is mostly caused by the environment. If B does not admit the murder or robbery, or if it is really a wrong, then another set of illusory and unfounded methods such as "branding oil pot," "grabbing an axe," "rolling a flour egg," and "gambling a death curse" will be used to decide to God. The two parties involved will lose money and hurt their bodies, and those who regard themselves as village elders (small heads of non-thousand-hundred-household princes and red card red insurance, that is, real old-brand robbers who bring disaster to others) will get the fisherman's benefit in vain. If the Tibetan people are confined to bad customs and evil examples and continue to harm their vitality, if a method is not found to eliminate them, it will not be a good plan for curbing the border and pacifying the people.</p>
<p>The Tibetan and Mongol peoples are the two major ethnic groups surrounding the Northwest in our country geographically. In history, they had a close relationship as early as thousands of years ago. Therefore, the lives of the two ethnic groups are very similar. The first nomadic life and the strong belief in Lamaism are the common characteristics of the Mongol and Tibetan peoples. They wear Buddha statues, provide for Buddhas at home, and recite scriptures before every meal, offering food to heaven and earth before eating. Even more so, after death, they give all the accumulated property to the temple, saying that they ask the Buddha to keep it for them, and they can still use it in the next life. When people and animals are sick, they are superstitious about the lamas' scriptures and spells, and do not seek medical treatment or medicine. If there is something happy, they say that it is a gift from God and must think of a way to repay it. If there is something they don't want, they say that it is a punishment from God and they must make a wish to exorcise it. Whether it is exorcising or repaying, it all goes back to the lamas making money. Therefore, the number of temples is increasing day by day, and the status of lamas is also increasing day by day. They sit and eat in peace and enjoyment, and the number of disciples is also increasing day by day. On the contrary, the population of secular people who are engaged in production is decreasing day by day. Moreover, Mongol and Tibetan youths can have wild combinations at will in the mountains and grasslands, and they break their bodies too early, so many do not reproduce, which is also one of the reasons for the decrease in population. In addition, they are superstitious about "good days," such as the first, thirteenth, fifteenth, and thirtieth days of each month, they do not kill cattle and sheep, or they pick good days and discard bad days, such as the nineteenth is a good day, the twentieth and twenty-first are not good, then they discard the twentieth and twenty-first and spend three consecutive days of the nineteenth, squeezing horse, cow, and sheep milk every morning and evening, making meals, herding livestock, drawing water, grinding noodles, and entertaining guests are all concentrated on the wives and daughters, who are extremely hard-working. Men, except for sewing clothes, mostly have no proper business. Moreover, the Mongol and Tibetan people like to inquire about news. When they see pedestrians on the road, whether they know them or not, they must ask them courteously. If they get something, they must spread it widely. Therefore, events that occur in the grassland are transmitted very quickly. These are all common customs of the Mongol and Tibetan peoples.</p>
<p>As for the national character of the Mongol and Tibetan peoples, there are differences. Especially in the Qinghai area, the people of the two ethnic groups who come into contact with each other initially cause conflicts in life due to the differences in their temperaments. The Tibetan people are strong and brave, while the Mongol people are weaker. The Tibetan people regard robbery and looting as capable, while the Mongol people regard being a robber as a disgrace. Although the men of both ethnic groups wear swords and knives, and are good at riding horses and shooting, if there is any dispute and they draw their swords at each other, most of the Mongol people will avoid it, and the Tibetan people will show off their strength. Or if the Mongol people are robbed by the Tibetan people, they often dare not pursue them, fearing that chasing and injuring people will cause them to lose their property and have to pay compensation for life. It is better to save trouble. Therefore, the twenty-nine banners of the original Mongol people in Qinghai used to spread along both banks of the Yellow River. Now, the Tibetan people's land is expanding day by day, and the Mongol people's land is shrinking day by day. As a result, the Mongol people in Henan have disappeared, and the Hebei are gradually unable to support it. Although the Mongol and Tibetan people have the strengths and weaknesses, they have the common habit of knowing the law but not knowing gratitude, and fearing power but not cherishing virtue. In the future, we should actively promote Mongol and Tibetan education, take advantage of the situation, and correct their prejudices, so that we can unite sincerely and not be deceived by foreigners.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Tea Trade Depression in Southern Fujian <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Affected by Reduced Exports to Nanyang</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Fujian Province is known for its tea production, with the producing areas being Wuyi in northern Fujian and Anxi in southern Fujian. Xiamen is a distribution center for tea in southern Fujian, supplying consumption in this province and exports to other provinces and overseas. Five or six years ago, the tea trade was extremely prosperous, with over a hundred tea firms. In recent years, due to the impact of the downturn, Nanyang's commerce has been sluggish, suffering a major blow. This year, only Yaoyang, Qiyuan, Jintai, Huang Quanpu, Fangmao, Jinxiang, Yuxiang, Chongmao, Wanchun, Wanquan, Wanfa, Deyi, Nanyan, Yanquan, Sanyang, Fusheng, Xiechang, Quanmao, Jinchun, Kecheng, Chun, Longfang, Xiuzhi, Ji, Meifanghui Ji, Wenji, Longquan, Chafang, Ganpu, Qingji, Minzhang, and more than 70 other smaller tea firms are selling Wuyi and Anxi tea. According to a recent survey, more than 30,000 boxes of Xicha are sold annually, half of which are sold locally and half of which are exported to the British and Dutch colonies in Nanyang. The British territories have lighter taxes, so they account for more. In recent years, the Nanyang economy has been weak, and sales channels have become narrower, and tea prices have also fallen. Over the years, the number of exports to Nanyang has gradually decreased. Xiamen's tea industry mainly sells to Nanyang, so the current situation is not as good as before, and sales have decreased to two-thirds of what they used to be. Currently, there are more than 70 tea firms left, among which only a few larger ones can maintain their operations. Most of the others are losing money. The larger ones such as Yaoyang and Qiyuan sell about one hundred and forty to fifty yuan a day in retail and wholesale (excluding exports to foreign countries). Next, Jintai, Huang Quanpu, Fangmao, and Jinxiang sell fifty or sixty yuan a day, and Yuxiang, Chongmao, Wanchun, Wanquan, Wanfa, Deyi, Nanyan, and Yanquan sell twenty or thirty yuan a day. Others sell only ten or twenty yuan, or less. Very few can maintain their operations. Therefore, tea firms have been closing down year by year. At the end of last year, more than 20 firms closed down, and tea prices plummeted. Tieguanyin, which used to sell for three yuan a box, is now only selling for two yuan and three corners. Other Oolong and narcissus teas have also fallen in price. However, high-end teas such as Wuyi famous varieties have not risen or fallen much, but these are luxury items for a small number of people and do not help the tea industry. However, sales have also been declining recently, and the number of people who like high-end tea is gradually decreasing. (6th)</p>

<p>The Xihu Road passes through this county, from southeast to northwest, its route quite long. There are dozens of bridges throughout the county, with the one spanning the Lianqi River outside the West Gate being the tallest. The County Chronicle Preparatory Committee, considering that the county's Ming Dynasty figures Hou Zhenyang, Hou Tongzeng, Hou Qizeng, and Huang Chunyao, Huang Jianyao and other martyrs raised armies to defend the city when the Qing troops descended, remaining unyielding through three massacres, and ultimately sacrificing their lives, believed that in this time of foreign aggression, these national heroes should be regarded as role models, widely promoted to inspire the people and encourage the customs. Therefore, the committee sent a letter through the County Education Bureau to request Education Director Zhou Fohai to name the bridge Hou Huang Bridge, so that those who pass by would know the lofty character and heroic integrity of Hou and Huang, and be moved by it. The Education Department has signed and forwarded the request to the Construction Department, which has agreed. Construction is currently underway.</p>

The Municipal Government and the Huinan area held review ceremonies. Boy Scouts from all over the city also held a flag-raising ceremony at the public stadium. The details of each event are described below:</p>
<h3 id="e95">Commemorative Meeting of All Sectors <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, all sectors held the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China commemorative meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce in Tianhou Temple Bridge. Representatives from various agencies, groups, party headquarters at all levels, and schools attended the meeting. The presidium included Pan Gongzhan (Party), Zhang Yuanruo (Government), Yu Zuoting (Commerce), Wu Xiu (Education), Yu Zhenhui (Agriculture), and Shao Xubai (Industry). More than 500 representatives from all sectors attended the meeting.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue: The gate of the City Chamber of Commerce was decorated with the Party and National flags and red and green lanterns. A bamboo cloth banner was hung with the words "Shanghai City Representatives Commemorate the 23rd National Day Anniversary Meeting." On both sides of the venue, various colored slogans were posted. In front of the rostrum, a slogan was hung on the right, an order of events was hung on the left, and a banner with the words "Shanghai City Representatives Commemorate the 23rd National Day Anniversary Meeting," the Party and National flags, and a portrait of Sun Yat-sen were hung in the center. The venue arrangement was especially solemn.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the ritual, the chairman, Pan Gongzhan, gave a report, saying in brief: In this time of national crisis, commemorating National Day, on the one hand, feels happy, on the other hand, feels very painful. In this situation, we feel that it is useless to not struggle upward and move forward, but only to shed tears. We recall the difficulties of the founding of the nation by the past martyrs, and we must summon up the utmost courage to fight desperately. Sun Yat-sen told us that the revolution has not yet succeeded, and comrades still need to work hard. The purpose of the national revolution is to seek freedom and equality. Now, who dares to say that China has obtained freedom and equality? The Xinhai Revolution certainly occupies an important page in the entire history of the national revolution. Today, we commemorate the fighting spirit of the martyrs and should summon our courage and exhaust our energy to continue to complete their unfinished cause. In other words, commemorating the past is for creating the future. The great achievements of the Xinhai Revolution are that it overthrew the autocratic system that had been passed down for thousands of years. Revolutionary volunteers under Sun Yat-sen's leadership exchanged blood and flesh for the establishment of the Republic of China. However, now the internal and external reactionary forces are intensifying their oppression of us, making the national crisis increasingly severe. May I ask if saving the nation is possible with partisan strife, each occupying one side? Now, we must abandon our private views and fight for the entire nation. First, we must be of one mind; second, we must cooperate. If we can be of one mind and cooperate, then the Chinese nation will not only save itself, but also become an invincible and powerful nation in the world. What should we work hard for with one mind and cooperation? First, productivity; second, defense force; third, organizational force. We must support a revolutionary leader to lead us to strengthen these three forces before the country can be strong and the nation can be revived. After the chairman's report, there were also speeches by Zhang Yuanruo, Wu Zhihao, and others. The speeches were lengthy and slightly ____. Slogans and Banners: Slogans: (1) October 10th is the anniversary of the revival of the Chinese nation. (2) Commemorating National Day requires promoting the New Life Movement. (3) Commemorating National Day requires suppressing the Red bandits. (4) Commemorating National Day requires striving for production and construction. (5) Prepare strength to recover lost territories. (6) Support revolutionary leader Chiang Kai-shek. (7) Long live the Kuomintang of China. (8) Long live the Republic of China. Banners: (1) Commemorating National Day, do not forget the difficulty of Sun Yat-sen and the martyrs in creating the Republic of China. (2) Commemorating National Day requires striving to resist Japan, wipe out humiliation, and seek revenge. (3) Commemorating National Day requires suppressing the Red bandits and stabilizing society.

<h3 id="e96">Joint Military and Political Commemoration <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>All departments and bureaus under the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, held a joint military and political National Day commemoration meeting in the Municipal Government Auditorium in the city center. Mayor Wu led the ceremony and delivered a report.</p>
<p>Attendees: Those who attended the meeting included Mayor and Commander Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Yu Hongjun, Director of the Security Bureau Yang Hu, Director of the Land Bureau Jin Liren, Director of the Health Bureau Li Ting'an, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Xu Peihuang, Chief of Staff of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters Xu Jinyuan, Adjutant General Gan Hailan, as well as all staff members of the various bureaus and departments under the Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters, totaling more than a thousand people.</p>
<p>Mayor's Report: After the formalities, Mayor Wu delivered the following report: "Comrades, today is the National Day of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. All civil servants, military police, and community members of Shanghai are holding this National Day commemoration ceremony here. Looking back on the past, observing the present, and planning for the future, we have unlimited feelings in our hearts. The Republic of China has been established for 23 years. During these 23 years, despite the efforts, struggles, and sacrifices of all our party comrades and the people of the whole country, we have not yet been able to make China rich and strong, nor have we been able to make China stable. Since September 18th, we have encountered an unprecedented blow, forming the most serious national crisis in China's history. We are examining why the Chinese revolution has not yet succeeded and why we have encountered such a major blow in the process of the revolution. The reasons are no more than the following: First, when the Xinhai Revolution succeeded, most of our party comrades believed that the revolution had succeeded. At the same time, the party's organization was not sound, and comrades did not have a deep understanding or earnestly implement the Premier's revolutionary doctrine and revolutionary strategy. Therefore, there was a common saying among the revolutionary comrades at that time, 'The revolutionary army is with us, the revolutionary party is gone.' At that time, the revolution had not yet succeeded, but the spirit of the group had already declined and disintegrated, the unity was not strong, and the strength was not sufficient. There is no doubt that the revolution could not be completely successful. This is the first reason. Second, before the Xinhai Revolution, our doctrine was not widely publicized among the people, and they did not thoroughly understand the revolutionary doctrine, thinking that the revolutionary movement was just a racial revolution, a revolution against the Qing Dynasty and restoring the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, after the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing Dynasty, the people of the whole country also believed that the revolution had succeeded. Under such circumstances, the revolutionary party could not but make a compromise. This compromise planted the seeds of disaster for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>Although we dare not say that this disaster can destroy China, it is enough to make China lag behind the world's surging torrent by 50 or 60 years. What is this disaster? It is the northern shift of the revolutionary government, the election of Yuan Shikai as the president, which led to the rule of warlords such as Yuan Shikai, Xu Shichang, Feng Guozhang, and Cao Kun, who used improper power to sell the country and only sought their own selfish interests. Because of this disaster, China has experienced small wars every half year and big wars every year for more than 20 years, with endless civil wars. Because of this disaster, the republican system has been shaken several times, so there was Zhang Xun's restoration and Yuan Shikai's稱 Emperor. These reasons have caused serious and unprecedented turmoil in China's politics and society, and China's national strength has declined day by day. Although the reasons for our current national crisis are very complicated and are caused by various national pathologies accumulated over nearly a century, if our party comrades could thoroughly implement the Premier's revolutionary doctrine and revolutionary strategy at the time of the Xinhai Revolution, if our revolutionary organization could be as united and strong as before the Xinhai Revolution, and if the revolutionary comrades could continue to work hard with the spirit of risking their lives with guns and bombs in more than a dozen revolutionary uprisings before the Xinhai Revolution, I believe that the Xinhai Revolution would not have been incomplete. If the Xinhai Revolution could be thorough, there would definitely not be Yuan Shikai. Without Yuan Shikai, there would be no arrogance of warlords, no restoration of Zhang Xun, and no civil wars for more than 20 years, which would have made the whole country unstable and the people unable to live. Nor would the national crisis have occurred so quickly, nor would the national crisis have been so serious today. If all party comrades could have the kind of strong unity and spirit of sacrifice before the Xinhai Revolution, and if the people of the whole country could also thoroughly understand the revolutionary doctrine and enthusiastically support the revolutionary movement, then even if we had this kind of national crisis, we would certainly be able to deal with it very calmly and confidently. The Shanghai War of January 28th, 1932, was not only heard by the citizens of Shanghai, but also witnessed by them. This war gave us a great lesson. At the time of the January 28th Shanghai War, if the country was unified, without the division between Ning and Yue, and without the scourge of the communists, our central government would certainly be able to command with ease, and be able to deal with the January 28th War with unity from top to bottom. Although our weapons were old and clumsy, our army would not have only resisted for more than 30 days, and the good impression that the Chinese nation gave to the world would certainly be even greater. Therefore, comrades, although the revolutionary party and the people of the whole country have made long-term efforts, struggles, and sacrifices for 23 years since the Republic of China, not only have they failed to make the revolution completely successful, not only have they failed to make all parts of the country stable, but they have also encountered an unprecedented national crisis. We cannot but blame those who undermine China's unity, we cannot but blame the disunity within the party, and we cannot but blame the fact that the people of the whole country have not thoroughly understood the revolutionary doctrine and have not contributed all their strength to the revolution. Therefore, on the occasion of the National Day of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, we should deeply recognize the lessons of this painful history. At the same time, I cannot but express my earnest expectations to the citizens. First, I hope that the citizens of Shanghai will not only carry out a widespread and powerful propaganda, but also take the lead in believing in a doctrine, the Three Principles of the People, so that the people of the whole country will believe in the Three Principles of the People, because the Three Principles of the People is the highest principle for us to be human beings and save the country. This is the first hope. Second, I hope to safeguard the unity of the country. If there are those who undermine the unity of the country, we will use all our strength to deal with them and stop them, so as to avoid the division of the country. The third hope is to support a revolutionary leader, because in the unstable situation of the country and the situation of not knowing what to do, we can only support a leader, and under the leadership of a leader, we can jointly carry out the revolutionary movement and jointly carry out the national salvation movement. Believing in a doctrine, supporting national unity, and supporting a leader are the most necessary conditions for saving the country and ensuring survival, and it is also the most effective way to save the country and ensure survival. We have had National Day every year since the 23rd year of the Republic of China, and we commemorate National Day every year, but we must never let the National Day of each year pass casually, nor should we make the National Day of each year become a meaningless ritual. In this National Day commemoration, we should review the lessons, stimuli, and pain we have suffered in the 23-year revolutionary process, and look forward to the arduousness of the national revolution and the work of saving the country and ensuring survival in the future. Everyone should supervise themselves, and should have a new understanding, a new spirit, and new courage. This new understanding, spirit, and courage is to believe in the Three Principles of the People, safeguard national unity, and support a revolutionary leader to save the country and ensure survival. I hope that the citizens of Shanghai can deeply understand this meaning on the occasion of commemorating National Day, take the lead in setting an example, advocate for the whole country, and widely publicize and awaken the people to act in unison. This is the understanding and spirit that we should have in commemorating National Day today." After the speech, he declared the meeting a success and adjourned.</p>

The Premier once said, 'My knowledge of political life began in that year.' Therefore, the memorial of the ordeal in London occupies an important page in the Premier's revolutionary history. After this, the Premier not only did not have the slightest fear of revolution, but also took the spirit of redoubled efforts to make the revolutionary work more intense and the revolutionary cause more developed. Because of the Premier's spirit of great fearlessness, the revolution has made considerable progress. We are here to commemorate the major setbacks suffered in the process of this revolutionary cause, which makes us more excited about the revolution and how we should strive to complete the unfinished revolutionary work. We believe that the most urgent requirement for the current revolution is that the revolutionary leaders should seek military, political, and economic unification and establish a strong central government. Even if the national crisis is serious, there will be a day to wash away the shame. However, at present, the people of the country are scattered in spirit and expose their lack of organization everywhere. This should awaken the people of the country to thoroughly correct their past mistakes and create a strong Chinese nation."</p>
<p>Memorial Slogans: (1) To commemorate the ordeal in London, we must continue the Premier's spirit of struggle, (2) To commemorate the ordeal in London, we must complete the Premier's unfinished legacy, (3) Eliminate the Red Bandits, (4) Strengthen national power, (5) Strive for production and construction, (6) The Premier's spirit is immortal, (7) Long live the Three Principles of the People.</p>

<p>Principal and Interest Totaling 44,060,000</p>
<p>The Remaining Over 30,000,000 Will Be Issued by the End of October</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, reliable sources in the financial community have confirmed that the Ministry of Finance has been successively issuing "Ping" (Certificate) principal certificates for the Intended Boxer Indemnity Loan, totaling 27,000,000 silver dollars, and "Zheng" (Proof) interest certificates, totaling 17,060,000 silver dollars. The two combined amount to 44,060,000 silver dollars, which are being sent in batches to the loan syndicate and then distributed to the various banks that have undertaken the loan. The remaining 17,000,000 silver dollars in principal certificates and 3,880,000 silver dollars in interest certificates will all be completed and sent to the syndicate before the end of October, which will then distribute them to the banks that have undertaken the loan for their use. It is noted that the total amount of these two types of principal and interest certificates is as high as 64,940,000 silver dollars. Although these certificates are not formally circulated in the market or on exchanges, they are in practice no different from government bonds. In the banking community, their price and credit are considered even higher than all other government bonds and securities, and they can be freely and fully mortgaged or transferred at any time. The certificates can also be used as reserves for issuing banknotes at the Central Bank and as a quarter of the guarantee money for savings banks.

<h3 id="e116">Silver Shops Transport Large Quantities of Gold Bars to Hankou <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Due to Price Decline, Inland Demand is Strong</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, silver shops in this city have recently been transporting gold to Hankou in very large quantities. The silver shops association has guaranteed to the municipal chamber of commerce that this transportation is for the silver shops' own use and that there is no smuggling involved. The municipal chamber of commerce then guarantees to the customs authorities, and only then can the gold be released. According to an investigation by the municipal chamber of commerce, the reason for the recent increase in gold shipments to Hankou is that various silver shops in this city, such as Lao Fengxiang, Xin Fengxiang, Qing He Fuju, Qing He Faji, and Qiu Tianbao, etc., all have branches in Hankou, Shashi, Yichang, Chongqing, etc. The eighth, ninth, and tenth months of the lunar calendar are the peak season every year, while November to April of the following year is average, and May, June, and July are the off-season. The recent large-scale transport of gold bars to Hankou and other ports is due to the initial price decline and the fact that it is currently the peak season, so the market is broader. If the market price in this city declines further, the demand in the interior will definitely increase, and shipments to various ports along the Yangtze River will become even stronger. If the gold market rises, the inland demand will stagnate, and gold bars may also be transported from the interior to Shanghai.</p>

The national crisis and National Day are fundamentally incompatible, but today's National Day happens to be in this unprecedented national crisis. However, we must not develop negative thoughts because it is a National Day in a national crisis. We should have the spirit of the Italians to invigorate ourselves and strive for the revival of the nation. We should also be like the Germans, who go mad on National Day, to awaken our spirit, so as to eliminate the national crisis and create a real National Day.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Grand Opening of the National Child Welfare Leaders Conference Yesterday Morning <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Speeches by Chairman Kung Hsiang-hsi, Huang Shao-hsiung, Wu Tieh-cheng, and Others</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek and Tai Chi-tao Elected as Honorary Chairman and Vice-Chairman</p>
<p>Review Committee Meeting Held in the Afternoon, Plenary Session to Discuss Proposals Today</p>
<p>The National Child Welfare Leaders Conference held its opening ceremony at 9:00 AM yesterday at the New Asia Restaurant Grand Ballroom on Tiantong Road. Exhibits of various forms and products from child welfare associations, nurseries, and orphanages from various provinces and cities were displayed. The grand occasion is described below:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement: The conference was held in the New Asia Restaurant's Grand Ballroom on the seventh floor. The national flag and the portrait of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen were hung in the center of the hall. The stage was filled with potted flowers. In the center of the stage were seats for the chairman and vice-chairman, with long tables arranged in four rows below. Seats were arranged on both sides, and slogans were hung on the walls: "Child welfare work is the work of cultivating people," "The child welfare conference is a conference for seeking the happiness of children," "The child welfare movement is a movement to save the nation," "The child welfare cause is the cause of nation-building," and so on.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: More than 170 guests and representatives attended the conference, including Finance Minister Kung Hsiang-hsi, Interior Minister Huang Shao-hsiung, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tieh-cheng, Chairman of the Relief Commission Xu Shi-ying, Wang Xiaolai, Qu Wenliu, Wu Xingya, Wen Hongen, Li Denghui, Lin Kanghou, Tai Xiling, Liu Zhanen, and Du Yuesheng. The ceremony was presided over by Chairman Kung Hsiang-hsi and master of ceremonies Chen Tiesheng.</p>
<p>Opening Remarks by the Chairman: After the ceremony, Chairman Kung Yongzhi, Minister of Finance, gave the opening remarks, saying, "Distinguished guests and representatives, today is the opening of the National Child Welfare Leaders Conference. I am here representing the China Child Welfare Association, and I also welcome you all on behalf of the Association. I am very honored. China's child welfare cause is now widespread throughout the country, and even in the border areas, establishments have been set up. This conference, the National Child Welfare Leaders Conference,"</p>
<p>"does not belong to any individual, nor does it belong to any religion. The Child Welfare Association has been working for six years. In addition to our efforts, we are now moving towards national unification. Therefore, after the establishment of the Child Welfare Association, we wanted to hold a conference for those in the charitable field so that we could all report, exchange opinions, and gain more practical benefits in various aspects, giving child welfare associations everywhere a compass. The foundation of the country depends on the people. The so-called great sages, great men, and great heroes are still individuals, but they have a great relationship with the country and society. For example, Mencius, if he could have been born a sage, then there would have been no need for the education of Mencius' mother. The actions of one person can affect the country and society. Everything in China today, such as education, production, and construction, is backward. God has given us a vast territory and a large nation. We should invigorate ourselves. The past work of the Child Welfare Association has been to cultivate sages, heroes, and the desire to save the country. The child welfare cause is a scientific cause, not only researching but also inventing various things. For example, sometimes people think that children cannot be taught, but some people can educate them to adulthood. The intelligence and wisdom of human beings are different. It is impossible for us to integrate them into one furnace, but our usual method is to teach according to aptitude. What I am contributing to you today is that child welfare is a joint cause. The reason why various causes in China have not been successful is that they are ruined by this. Everyone acts independently, which affects the country and society. If we can unite to educate children in various places and promote parental care in children's families, then I believe that children will serve society in the future with a spirit of cooperation for the country, and we can expect China to become strong. Therefore, the child welfare cause is also a cause of saving the country. Premier Sun Yat-sen once said that the revolution has not yet succeeded, and comrades still need to work hard. Furthermore, in order to achieve the goal of the revolution, he also said to unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally and fight together. If we cannot unite ourselves, how can we unite the world? Today's representatives have come from afar, and I hope that we can exchange opinions on our usual excellent achievements and unite in the future to promote China's child welfare cause." Mayor's Welcome Speech: "Ladies and gentlemen, this year's National Child Welfare Association Leaders Conference is being held in Shanghai. I am very honored to be the host and to gather with child welfare leaders from all over the country. Your association has been established for six years. There are representatives from more than ten provinces participating in your conference today, which shows that your association not only has a long history in time but also a very wide scope in space. In the past six years, the work and achievements that you have made for Chinese society and Chinese children have gradually attracted the attention and sympathy of the people. Therefore, when I welcome you today, I should first express my deep respect for your past efforts. Although child welfare is generally regarded as a social cause, it has become a part of the government's duties due to the evolution of modern countries. Moreover, newborn countries after the war have given constitutional protection to children's lives and rights. Even in ancient China, during periods of clear and bright politics, education and upbringing were always implemented together, and raising children and caring for the elderly were valued by the government. Confucius said, "Let the young be cared for, and the widowed, orphaned, lonely, and disabled be provided for." Mencius said, "Love the young of others as you love your own." These are the important principles of our country's emphasis on child welfare. The importance of the child welfare cause is of course needless for me to elaborate on in front of you. However, in principle of political science, the people are the elements that constitute a country. In principle of sociology and eugenics, the strength of a nation is based on the quality of its people. Therefore, a wise statesman and a visionary entrepreneur pay attention to the education of their citizens. Especially in the process of national revival and strengthening, we should work even harder on this kind of work. The reason why King Goujian of Yue wanted to have ten years of procreation and ten years of training was for this reason. Fichte of Germany was even more specific and practical. He advocated that to revive Germany, we must first start by cultivating the seeds of the nation. In historical fact, the revival of the Yue and the revival of Germany were both the results of this theory. From this ancient and modern Chinese and foreign historical process, we can clearly recognize the connection between the child welfare cause and the revival of the nation. Therefore, I believe that your cause is not a simple social work, but also bears a heavy responsibility for reviving the nation. Regarding this point, I have repeatedly said in the essay contest for your association's Children's Day last year and at the general meeting in the first half of this year. I don't need to repeat it again today. I sincerely wish the development of China's child welfare cause and the success of all of you."</p>
<p>Huang Shao-hsiung's Speech: Next, Interior Minister Huang Shao-hsiung delivered a speech saying, "Chairman, distinguished representatives, the National Child Welfare Leaders Conference is now in session. I am pleased to be able to participate today. Thinking back to the Child Welfare Association, since its establishment in 1928 until now, there have been many achievements in various places. Today, we are gathering child welfare leaders from all over the country to connect with each other. The future benefits will be even greater. In the past in China, we cannot say that there was no child welfare cause, but for various reasons, it could not be expressed. The reason for this is, first, that everyone was doing their own thing. From the people to the government, they could not unite. All of our various causes in China should be done together. Therefore, I hope that the leaders engaged in child welfare can earnestly connect with each other after today's meeting and communicate with the government. Then, when government assistance is needed, the government will certainly assist them. Second, we feel that the past child welfare cause was not in line with scientific organization. The collapse of charitable halls in various places was due to unscientific reasons. I hope that the child welfare cause will be scientific in the future. Then the organization will be sound, the foundation will be solid, and it can forever create happiness for mankind's child welfare. Third, the child welfare cause is of great significance today. The stage from birth to adulthood is worthy of attention. Most children have not received good education and hygiene. How can a new and strong country be created by people who have not received good education and hygiene? Today, countries around the world are paying attention to the education of children because the new country is tied to children. Therefore, our child welfare cause should expand its thinking and work hard on the foundation of the country. Fourth, the gentlemen engaged in child welfare are gathered here today. Next year is Children's Year, and we can come up with a good plan. The Ministry of Interior will provide a large amount of assistance politically," he said.</p>
<p>Congratulations from Wang, Sun, and Tai: (1) Telegram from Premier Wang Zhaoming of the Executive Yuan: "To Vice President Kung, transferred to the full mercy conference for your appraisal, the opening of the conference, Zhaoming is unable to attend due to matters in Beijing, and I am very sorry, I respectfully congratulate the conference on its grand compatriots and the wishes of Kang Ning. "If you can love the young of others as you love your own, then you can make people not only love their own parents but also their own children." Sincerely wish, please share and appreciate." (2) Congratulatory message from Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke: "Spring bamboo sheds its skin, the atmosphere soars to the sky, the clear spring flows newly, gushing like a tide, infants are happily nurtured, their bodies are heroic, their heavenly minds are lively, and kites and fish swim freely. Benevolence and kindness spread widely, and all things and people are compatriots." (3) Ode from Examination Yuan President Dai Jitao: "There are many causes for saving the country, but saving children is the most urgent and effective, and the future holds the greatest hope. Even in terms of management, it is the most enjoyable and meritorious. In all matters under the heavens, good and evil are often opposites. The most meritorious is also the most sinful, the most enjoyable is also the most distressing, and the most beneficial to the country and society is also the most harmful to the country and society. This depends on the heart and actions of those involved. Shakyamuni Buddha taught people to cultivate themselves, saying, "Bodhi is the cause, great compassion is the root, and expediency is the ultimate." He also said, "Wisdom is the mother, and expediency is the father. The Bodhi mind is the mind of great compassion, joy, and equanimity." The meaning of wisdom is most difficult to express. Those without wisdom cannot know what wisdom is. If we try to speculate with foolish opinions, it should be similar to the meaning of "manifesting virtue" in the Great Learning. That is, without the merit and virtue of investigating things, extending knowledge, making intentions sincere, rectifying the heart, cultivating the self, regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world, one cannot obtain the clarity of this "manifesting virtue." By analogy, without the merit of giving, observing precepts, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom, one cannot achieve the fruit of wisdom. Expediency is everything in everything. People must be able to practice both compassion and wisdom, giving both material and spiritual aid, and then they can speak of expediency. Therefore, this cause of great benefit, great merit, and great joy, if those involved have wisdom and expediency, and their efforts are not beyond their abilities, then the result will easily be the opposite. Therefore, in recent years, I have deeply understood the importance of this cause and have been persuading people to work hard for it every day. I have also tried my best to help others do it, but I have never dared to easily take on the responsibility myself. Is this matter so difficult? I will answer by saying that for someone as foolish and clumsy as I am, I can certainly see that this matter is difficult, truly more difficult than the ancient Shu Road. I dare not use climbing to heaven as an example. Try to think about why there are so many orphaned and suffering children in China. The reason for this is absolutely not in heaven but in people. Also, try to think about why so few young people in China become successful and so many fail to become useful talents. Why is Chinese education less successful and more failing? Why are so few of China's industrial, commercial, agricultural, and forestry enterprises successful and so many unsuccessful? The reason for this is also always due to insufficient human effort. The child welfare cause is related to the family, society, education, and economic enterprise. We dare not say that charitable enterprises can transcend everything and have special achievements. The infant care enterprises in various places can be taken as an example. The proponents of utilitarianism say that only the successful can be considered good under heaven. Although we are unwilling to acknowledge this saying, we also dare not completely oppose it. Therefore, regarding China's charitable enterprise, especially regarding the future of charitable enterprise, we sincerely dare not but be diligent. This is what we earnestly pray of the compassionate leaders, gentlemen, and ladies who are the second parents of the pitiable children."</p>
<p>Madam Tai's Reply: Finally, Ms. Tai Zhizhi, daughter of Madam Tai Xiling, delivered a reply on behalf of her father, saying that her father was ill and asked her to deliver the reply on his behalf. Today, all of you are participating in this conference with enthusiasm for the child welfare cause. I firmly believe that the future of China's child welfare cause will become increasingly prosperous. At the same time, with the support of Finance Minister Kung, the protection of Minister Huang and Mayor Wu, the child welfare cause and those engaged in the child welfare cause will not feel any difficulties politically or economically. What we should strive for is still to make the child welfare cause scientific, and so on. Finally, she thanked the guests who attended the conference on behalf of the conference, and Chairman Kung Hsiang-hsi led all the representatives and guests to take a group photo in the rooftop garden of the New Asia Restaurant as a souvenir.</p>

<h3 id="e122">The Collapse of the China Industrial Bank <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Accountant Xu Chao Began Checking Accounts Yesterday</p>
<p>Qunyi Syndicate and Branches Closed Simultaneously</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the China Industrial Bank at 172 Nanjing Road suddenly announced liquidation yesterday morning due to the manager running away and a financial crisis. Its affiliated China Qunyi Syndicate and six branches were closed simultaneously. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Liquidation Notice: Yesterday, lawyer Zhang Ding, representing the Shanghai China Qunyi Syndicate, and accountant Xu Chao, representing the Shanghai China Industrial Bank, issued a liquidation notice stating that, according to the representatives of the aforementioned parties, recently, the manager of the head office, Qin Baoyuan, fled with funds, which occurred suddenly, causing a financial crisis and making it impossible to maintain operations. Effective immediately, liquidation is announced. All creditors are requested to bring their creditor certificates to the office for registration within two weeks of the publication of this notice. Failure to do so will be considered abandonment of the claim. Customers who owe money are also requested to pay directly to this office within the same period, and a receipt will be issued. Failure to do so will result in legal action. (Office: 172 Nanjing Road, 2nd Floor, Telephone 90244) The Bank's History: The bank was established in 1925 during Wu Peifu's powerful reign in Hubei. It was founded by Wu's secretary, Sun Danlin, Gao Enhong, and others, with Zhang Xingsan as the manager. The head office was located in Hankou, with a branch in Shanghai. All remittances from Wu's military and political figures, the Hubei provincial treasury, and Wu's military expenses were paid through the bank. For a time, business was very prosperous. When Wu stepped down, the bank was also affected and reorganized. Xie Jiao Leshan was promoted to manager, and Lu Mengxiang was the co-manager. The head office was moved to Shanghai, and the Hankou head office was changed to a branch. After the September 18th Incident, it was reorganized again, but business was on the verge of danger. Later, Lu Xihou, a standing director, organized the Qunyi Syndicate, invested 300,000 yuan, and mortgaged the bank's own property, the Xingye Lane building on Nanjing Road, for more than 800,000 yuan, which was transferred to the bank, thus enabling it to survive until now.</p>
<p>Branches: In addition to the head office at 172 Nanjing Road, the bank has three other branches in Shanghai: one at 31 Tianzhutang Street, managed by Zhou Shuqing; one at 89 Dongmen Road, Sixteen Puli, Nanshi, managed by Wang Jixuan; and one at 17 Fuxu Road. The Suzhou branch is located on Guanqian Street, and the sub-branch is located on Lindun Road. The Songjiang branch is located on Ximen Street. There was also a branch in Haizhou, but it was closed at the same time as the Hankou branch in August last year. The important personnel of the head office include directors Wu Lihua, Zhang Qingcheng, Tu Baoyi, Ji Zongsu, Zhou Zhufeng, supervisors Yang Kentang, Lu Jingxing, Zhu Junqing, standing director and general manager Xiang Xiang, standing director Lu Xihou, manager Qin Baoguang, and co-manager Lu Mengxiang.</p>
<p>Reasons for Liquidation: According to banking sources, the China Industrial Bank is a limited company, has not joined the Banking Association, and has not issued banknotes. Although it handles savings and remittances, the deposits absorbed in this city are not many, about ten thousand yuan. The reason for the announcement of liquidation is of course that the business is losing money and cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>Female Worker Depositors: After the bank collapsed yesterday, because the newspapers were also in recess, very few people knew about it. It was not until the afternoon that depositors began to register at accountant Xu's office. However, Xu was very busy checking accounts and would have to wait until today or tomorrow to begin registration. When the reporter went to the head office on Nanjing Road in the afternoon, he saw a middle-aged woman standing in front of the bank with her companion. She said that she worked in a light bulb factory and had saved 600 yuan in her lifetime, which she had deposited in the bank to earn interest. Now she unexpectedly announced liquidation. Tears were about to burst from her eyes. Alas!</p>
<p>Formation of Creditor Group: It is reported that the creditors of the bank have formed a creditor group and have engaged lawyer Wang Peiyuan as their agent. The creditor registration office is located at Wang's law office, Room 514, 5th Floor, Continental Market.</p>

<p>Japanese Side Investigating the Culprit</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that at around 10:25 PM on Tuesday night, a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei was stabbed in the abdomen with a bayonet by a Japanese Marine soldier of unknown name in a lane near Avenue Doumer. He endured the pain and reported the incident to the nearest patrolman. He was then taken to the Tongren Hospital by rickshaw. It is reported that his injuries are quite critical. According to the rickshaw puller, the soldier hired a rickshaw at the Outer Hongqiao on North Sichuan Road to a dark alley off Avenue Doumer. After getting out of the rickshaw, he only gave the puller ten copper coins. The puller thought it was too little and continued to ask for more. Unexpectedly, the soldier drew his bayonet and stabbed the puller in the abdomen before fleeing. The Avenue du Roi Albert police station, the Japanese consular police, and the Japanese Marines all investigated the assailant. As of late Wednesday night, there were still no clues.</p>

<p>Two Suicide Notes Expressing Extreme Depression</p>
<p>Lost Future, Unwilling to Live</p>
<p>The Baoshan Hotel on Baoshan Road, Zhabei, had a young lodger check in the afternoon before yesterday. The hotel bookkeeper opened Room 15 for him to stay in. The young man called himself Chen Wangnian, 23 years old, from Yuyao. After slightly consuming tea and water, he closed the door and went to sleep, as if he was exhausted from a long journey. He did not call the tea boy to prepare a meal in the evening. It wasn't until about 8:00 AM yesterday morning that the tea boys suddenly heard moaning coming from the room. Knowing that something had happened, they hurriedly invited the bookkeeper to open the door and enter. They saw that the young man's complexion had changed drastically, and he was barely breathing. They immediately reported to the Beizhan Police Station and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, because he had ingested too much poison, it was impossible to save him, and he died in the hospital at about 9:00 AM. Two suicide notes were found on his person, one to his younger brother and one to his uncle and aunt. The general meaning of the notes was that they were full of resentment and dissatisfaction. At the same time, because his job was not satisfactory and the future was uncertain, he took his own life. It was later learned that he had worked as an apprentice at the New China Company at 378 Jiangxi Road before his death. Yesterday afternoon, the corpse was requested to be examined by the local court through the local police, and the local police were ordered to temporarily coffin and bury it, awaiting identification by the relatives of the deceased.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Secret Morphine Smuggling Leaves No Trace; Science Exacerbates Evil <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Open Smuggling into Shanghai by Boiling Morphine and Soaking it into Wool</p>
<p>Extracting Poisonous Substances from Wool Using Chemical Methods</p>
<p>丨Had There Not Been a Fire, It Would Not Have Been Easily Detected丨</p>
<p>At approximately 10:30 AM the day before yesterday, a massive four-story building at 175, 176, and 177 Aivin Road in Xinzha suddenly caught fire. After the fire was extinguished by the fire brigade, it was discovered by the Xinzha police station that the burned premises was a large-scale morphine manufacturing operation. The details of the morphine manufacturing operation and the aftermath of the fire are described as follows:</p>
<p>Extravagant Lifestyle Cai Bicheng specializes in manufacturing morphine. He lives at No. 24, Lane 1124, Xinzha Road (Qinyuan Village). Having engaged in this business for a long time, his profits are considerable, and his lifestyle is exceptionally luxurious. He owns a private car with license plate number 5787. The morphine manufacturing facility on Aivin Road has been in operation for several months. The building is newly constructed, with a monthly rent of 300 taels of silver. Cai rented it because its location is close to his home, making it easy to manage.</p>
<p>Ingenious Smuggling Method The method of manufacturing morphine is quite novel. The raw materials for morphine all come from Sichuan, but because these are prohibited items, transportation is difficult. Therefore, the raw materials are first boiled in water in Sichuan, and then wool is used to absorb the water. Once the wool is dry, it is packed and transported to Shanghai. As a result, although it is inspected by customs along the way, because the item is wool and has no odor, it has never been discovered. After this wool, saturated with poisonous water, is transported to the manufacturing facility, it is first handed over to the morphine manufacturers on the fourth floor, who re-soak the wool in water, completely washing out the poisonous substances it has absorbed. The clear water immediately turns turbid, and this turbid water is moved to the third floor.</p>
<p>Sudden Fire Alarm On this floor, skilled chemists refine the water, and morphine is finally extracted from the sand. The cost of the raw materials is very low, and the refined morphine is sold at a high price. At noon the day before yesterday, the third floor was in the process of chemical refining when an engineer carelessly allowed chemical liquid to come into contact with fire, causing the fire. All those working on the third floor, seeing the intense flames and being unable to extinguish them, fled together, hurriedly rushing to Cai Bicheng's residence to report. Cai, realizing that the secret would inevitably be exposed, drove away in his private car after hearing the alarm, ordering his driver, Xu Laisheng, to flee quickly.</p>
<p>Two Arrested At this time, the fire brigade and the Xinzha police station each sent personnel to rush to the fire scene. They all noticed a strange smell emanating from the smoke. Initially, they suspected that opium was being burned. After the fire was extinguished, they suddenly saw two people escaping from the roof of the fourth floor to a neighboring house. They were intercepted by Detective Tang Jian, Detective Lu Gendi, and Detective Yang Youshan, who were at the scene. They immediately entered the burning house to investigate and learned that it was a morphine manufacturing operation. The manufacturing equipment on the third and fourth floors was still intact, and there were many remaining raw materials. According to those familiar with the morphine market, the value of the morphine that had been manufactured and not yet manufactured in the house was considerable.</p>
<p>Principal Offender at Large Detective Tang and others, seeing the numerous items in the house, took the two arrested men back to the police station for questioning. They learned that one was Gong Baochang from Tongzhou, and the other was Miao Zhangcai from Anhui, both of whom worked on the fourth floor. The police chief ordered them to be detained and dispatched many Chinese and foreign detectives to guard the morphine manufacturing facility. Meanwhile, Detective Tang and others were sent to Cai Bicheng's home to arrest the principal offender. However, Cai had already driven away in his car. Therefore, all police stations were notified to be on alert. Soon, Cai's car was discovered in the garage of a Mr. Qiu at No. 21 Xieqiao Road. Qiu was a friend of Cai's. Cai drove out of his house and, passing Qiu's garage, abandoned the car and fled. His driver then temporarily parked the car there.</p>
<p>Judicial Inspection Soon after, the gatekeeper of the Commercial Press workshop, which was near the manufacturing facility, also arrested Gong Wenfu, a worker from Tongzhou, who had fled from the fourth floor. All of them were sent to the First Special District District Court yesterday morning. Judge Liu Yugui conducted the interrogation. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin briefly described the situation and requested a site inspection. Judge Liu questioned Gong and the other two men, who all stated that they had recently been hired and received a monthly salary of eight yuan. Judge Liu ordered them to be detained and scheduled to personally inspect the fire scene at 2:30 PM today.</p>

<p>In this era of industrial decline and commercial recession, the Family Industry Cooperative is uniquely able to cope with ease. It is estimated that the business volume for the nine months of this year has exceeded the total for the entire year of last year by more than one time. It is only through excellent products and proper management that this can be achieved. Recently, the Inter-Aid National Goods Cosmetics Industry Exhibition was promoted at the Nanjing Road distribution point. For a month, the grand occasion has not diminished. The Women's National Goods Year Movement Committee, because cosmetics and daily necessities are closely related to women, initiated a visit to the Family Industry Cooperative's cosmetics exhibition on Double Ten Day, led by Mrs. Cai Yuanpei, Mrs. Wu Tiecheng, Mrs. Qian Xinzhi, Mrs. Pan Gongzhan, Huang Renzhi, Sun Daosheng, Pan Yangyao, Lin Kecong, Hu Xiyuan, and more than thirty other gentlemen and ladies. The Cooperative originally scheduled to close on Double Ten Day, but to welcome the visit of the committee members, the sales department was kept open as usual. Anyone who purchased one yuan of Peerless Brand products received one yuan worth of goods as a gift. At 1:00 PM, the cooperative's entrance was already crowded with people competing to purchase. By around 2:00 PM, even the pedestrians on the road were blocked. The Family Industry Cooperative contacted the Public Works Department by telephone to request additional police to maintain order. Meanwhile, a temporary universal coupon was issued. Anyone holding this coupon would receive the same treatment as on Double Ten Day for purchases made from the Family Industry Cooperative within ten days. The exhibition period for the Inter-Aid National Goods Cosmetics Industry Exhibition was extended for ten days. Those without coupons were not eligible. The cooperative's manager, Chen Xiaodie, personally oversaw the proceedings at the scene. Purchasers entered and exited the Family Industry Cooperative sales department in an orderly manner. The guests were able to freely select and purchase to their satisfaction. According to Mr. Chen, mutual assistance among industries is the newest element in modern commerce, and this is not limited to the cosmetics industry. Therefore, there are plans to expand it and rename it the National Goods Treasures Association. All related industries with connections to household daily necessities can gather for exhibition. The Family Industry Cooperative will provide commercial space and be responsible for advertising and promotional expenses, to achieve the justice of industry association. It is said that after the cosmetics exhibition closes, the knitting industry will continue the exhibition. The knitting industry association has already contacted the Family Industry Cooperative.</p>

<p>More than 3,000 visitors on the first day</p>
<p>Distribution of various designs for the new family life</p>
<p>Xinhua Bank of this city, in order to solve the urban housing problem, established Xinhua Village on West Physical Education Road. The preparations have been reported in various newspapers. Taking advantage of the bank's 20th anniversary, the Xinhua Village Exhibition is scheduled to be held from the 10th to the 15th of this month. The bank has also printed bus vouchers for Huashang Public Buses to give to all sectors of society for transportation. The reporter went to visit and briefly recorded the grand occasion as follows. The reporter took a bus from Tiantong'an with a voucher and arrived at the entrance of West Physical Education Road. There was a receptionist to lead the signing-in process, and then a copy of the "Overview of Visiting Xinhua Village" was issued, and then the visit was conducted in order according to the map. The exhibition is divided into four parts: (1) Real Estate Exhibition, (2) Architectural Design Exhibition, (3) Home Furnishing Exhibition, and (4) Exhibition of various statistical charts and models of trust savings drawn by the bank, which are displayed separately in various houses such as A, B, C, and E. The interior layout is extremely beautiful. In addition to explaining the architecture of the new village and various house designs one by one, the interior bedrooms, living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens, and kitchens of the new home are decorated with artistic decorations, which is very interesting. Among them, the "Introduction to the Characteristics of Xinhua Village" in the first room of the Real Estate Exhibition, various house model, the price list of various houses in the second room, and the installment payment form, and the samples of various building materials in the fourth and fifth rooms are sufficient for the general public to borrow from when purchasing real estate or choosing a house. The various architectural designs of the Huagai Architectural Firm and the Fan Wenzhao Architectural Firm displayed in the architectural exhibition also show different styles of design, which can be compared. There is also a detailed map of the new sea route and a land valuation table of Shanghai and the Special Zone, which allows visitors to gain a detailed understanding. The Home Furnishing Exhibition has each room in the house arranged with appropriate appliances for different purposes, which is extremely gorgeous. It is said that it is produced by China National Goods Company and Shentai Furniture Store. There is another rest area, occupying a house, displaying various photos of Xinhua Bank and various savings trust charts and meaningful models, showing the bank's service to all aspects of society. In addition, there are several open spaces that are being designed and constructed, with land demarcation and tree planting, which is extremely busy. It can be seen that the village is developing rapidly, and it is indeed an unprecedented achievement in creating a new village in the city. The village occupies a rectangular area of more than 50 acres and is divided into more than 40 houses, divided into five types: A, B, C, D, and E. The architectural styles are different from each other. The value, including land and construction equipment, ranges from 3,400 yuan to 20,000 yuan. Subscribers can first pay three-tenths of the full price, and the rest can be repaid in installments. It is most economical for middle-class citizens. It is now estimated that two-thirds of all houses have been subscribed for. Moreover, the location is moderate, the scenery is quiet, the transportation is convenient, the public utility facilities are complete, and the surrounding security is complete, which meets the conditions of an ideal residence. The weather was sunny yesterday, and more than 3,000 visitors came, including ladies and gentlemen. Many groups and schools went there in groups. For a time, the carriages and horses were bustling, which was really a grand occasion. At that time, Xinhua Bank also distributed small booklets of various living application designs for the new family, one for each person, to add to the fun, which is also one of the bank's services to the community.</p>

The bank's national goods revolving collateral loan regulations are listed on the left: "In order to support national goods industries and commerce and facilitate production and sales cooperation, the bank has specially established a type of national goods revolving collateral loan, and the method is as follows: 1. Pure Chinese national goods can be used to borrow funds from the bank. The goods used as collateral can still be freely sold with the bank's consent, which is called national goods revolving collateral loan. 2. All goods used as collateral must be those that are commonly sold on the market, and their value must be based on the current market price. 3. The discount on the collateral loan will be determined based on the rise and fall of the goods value. If the market price falls, the collateral borrower should increase the collateral items. The collateral loan interest and term will be negotiated bilaterally. 5. If Shanghai National Goods Company or China National Goods Production and Sales Company is entrusted to act as a wholesale agent for sales, Shanghai National Goods Company will issue a proof of inventory, and the proof of inventory can be used as collateral for this collateral loan. 6. The remaining goods stored in the company that have not been sold should be redeemed by the collateral borrower within a time limit. If a continued loan is required, it will be determined by the bank. 7. All collateral loans must be insured, and the insurance policy must be deposited with the bank and transferred to the bank's name. 8. All revolving collateral loans must find a reliable guarantor. 9. If the goods cannot be sold out upon expiration and the collateral borrower cannot redeem them, the bank has the right to auction them freely. The collateral borrower voluntarily waives the right to first prosecution defense, and if the auction is insufficient, the guarantor shall be responsible for repaying the principal and interest. 10. The bank may revise these regulations at any time.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Lawyer Zhu Kuangming Sues Lawyer Gu Jirong Case <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Re-examined by Judge Wu Tingqi</p>
<p>Witness Li Huchen testified in court yesterday</p>
<p>Lawyer Gu Jirong was previously commissioned by Tao Shangen to sue Pan and others for debt disputes. After the First Special District District Court ruled that the defendants should repay the debt, Pan and others refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the second and third instance courts by their lawyer Zhu Kuangming. However, the results were all unsuccessful, and Pan was afraid of being executed, so he fled to the Chinese Concession. Recently, he was still arrested by the Shanghai Local Court in the city in order to be escorted and pursued. At this time, Tao Shangen suddenly received a letter from the debtor, stating that the previous second and third instance appeals were not their intention. Tao's friend was by his side, and upon reading this letter, he stated that since it was not Pan and others who insisted on appealing, it must have been Pan and others' lawyer Zhu Kuangming who acted without authorization. Therefore, he encouraged Tao to file a criminal private prosecution with the Shanghai Local Court against Zhu, accusing him of forging documents. Unexpectedly, while Tao was involved in a lawsuit with Zhu, he also discussed with his lawyer Gu Jirong and Ji Chao, who had previously served as Gu's clerk. First, he notified Zhu Kuangming by telephone, requesting a private settlement outside. Then, he personally went to Zhu's office to discuss the settlement terms, and said that the local court had issued an arrest warrant, and if he could pay 500 yuan, the case could be closed. Gu drafted a settlement draft. Zhu, seeing that they were intent on extortion and could not be reasoned with, immediately detained the draft and reported it to the police. Gu Jirong and Tao Shangen then separately left Zhu's residence. Zhu then filed a complaint with the First Special Court accusing Gu, Tao, and Ji Chao of colluding in fraud. The summons of the various parties has been reported in detail in this newspaper. It is now known that the case should be tried by Judge Wu Tingqi, but Wu was ill and requested leave to recuperate. Therefore, Judge Zhan Liangce tried the case. Now that Judge Wu has recovered from his illness and has returned to the court to work as usual, the case is still being handled by Judge Wu. Yesterday afternoon, he specially summoned the original defendant, the plaintiff, and both parties' witnesses to the court for a new trial. However, the disputes and events described by the original plaintiff and the defendant were the same as the previous statements, so there is no need to repeat them. Afterwards, witness Li Huchen was summoned to the court for questioning. Li stated that he was a clerk in Lawyer Gao's office and was a neighbor of Lawyer Zhu. On August 23rd, Gu Jirong and Tao Shangen went to Zhu's office. Afterwards, they asked Zhu to return the draft, but Zhu refused to return it, so they quarreled. Witness Zhang Dingxiang testified that on August 9th, I went to Zhu's office. Ji Chao was also present and said that Gu Jirong had ordered him to come to Zhu to negotiate a settlement of the case, and Ji also wanted Zhu to pay some money. However, the defendant Ji Chao denied going to Zhu's office, saying that Zhu called me to mediate, and cited Qin Xing to testify. Judge Wu ordered a change of date for another hearing because further investigation was needed.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment After Interrogation</p>
<p>Ma Mouxiang, a Henan native and former detective No. 5 of the General Inspectorate, was arrested and sent to the First Special Court on suspicion of inciting injury. The initial trial resulted in Ma being declared innocent. Subsequently, the Inspectorate appealed, and the Second High Court of Appeals concluded the trial, overturning the original verdict and sentencing Ma to eight months' imprisonment. However, Ma had been released on bail during the appeal and fled without a trace upon hearing the sentence, avoiding arrest. Later, the Special Court offered a reward of 500 yuan for his capture. On the 5th of this month, detectives from the Chinese Public Security Bureau apprehended Ma and handed him over to the Special Court for imprisonment. Now, Yang Chengjie, a Chinese detective from the Putuo Road Inspectorate, has discovered that Ma, while serving as a detective last March, had a thief steal a pair of binoculars and pawn them at Hongde Pawnshop on Father Jin's Road. Ma, as a detective, went to the pawnshop to identify the original thief. The victim redeemed the pawn for 15 yuan, which Ma embezzled for his own use, issuing a receipt to the pawnshop for record, but never paid the victim. Similarly, he embezzled the pawn money of 10 yuan for a typewriter from Qingyuan Pawnshop on Hankou Road, 22 yuan for a coat from Changsheng Pawnshop on Beihai Road, and 12 yuan for clothes from Tongyuan Pawnshop on Baker Road. After reporting these multiple cases to the head of the Inspectorate, Ma was brought from prison and sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Zhang Tianyin, the Inspectorate's lawyer, presented the case, prosecuting Ma for embezzlement in the course of his duties under Article 357 of the Criminal Law. After clear interrogation by Judge Liu, Ma Mouxiang was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for continuous embezzlement in the course of his duties, to be served concurrently.</p>

Wang Shilin was originally the North China record holder, but due to an ankle injury from the long jump, his take-off was labored, so he only managed to compete for second place. After 1.70 meters, only Wu Bixian cleared it. In the individual competition, he continued to jump tirelessly. At 1.83 meters, he cleared it on the second attempt and then raised it to 1.85 meters, but all three attempts failed due to fatigue.</p>

In the preliminary round, the veteran Lu Ming had the longest throw. Liu and Yang were not particularly strong. The third throw was when they first obtained qualifications for the final. At the start of the final, Liu seized the first position on the first attempt, Lu was second, Yang was third, and Zhang remained in last. In the last attempt, Yang tried hard to get second place. Lu is the famous former shot put athlete from Shanghai. This time, he represented Chahar. Because he had been neglecting practice, he did not get good results. Liu could have achieved a result of 12.69 meters, but because the ground was soft and difficult to gain traction, he only achieved this result.</p>

<p>(Tianjin, 10th): In today's senior football game, Hebei vs. Liaoning, Hebei's defense was strong and powerful, and the goalkeeper was able to fulfill his duties. Liaoning's five forwards and midfielders had excellent coordination, and their individual skills were also wonderful. It was a pity that the venue was too soft, and the ball was new and slippery, making it difficult to gain traction. The defense and goalkeeper often missed the ball, so Hebei took advantage of it, resulting in failure. Many viewers sighed with regret. In the senior Beiping vs. Shandong, the Beiping team had excellent coordination skills, while Shandong was scattered and unorganized. Although individual skills were good, they could not save the critical situation. The Beiping team went all out in the second half, and the defense also went to the front line to play. The ball always hovered in front of the Shandong goal, resulting in a 5-1 result.</p>

However, after the ball landed, it was just outside the baseline, so it was judged as a re-serve. Henan was not convinced and argued with the referee, almost resorting to violence. After many people explained, the game was finally completed.</p>

The Association authorities plan to take advantage of their passage and invite them to land and perform, so that people in our country can observe and learn. They have already contacted Mr. Topping, the secretary of the Western Qiao Youth Association, for consultation. It is learned that when the team returns from the Philippines and passes through Shanghai (around the end of the month), it will be the opening of the International Games, and they will perform on stage.</p>
<h3 id="e173">National Day Football Match: Tung Wah Defeats Holders <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Tung Wah Concedes First Goal</p>
<p>Wins 2-1 in the End</p>
<p>After returning from their northern expedition, the Tung Wah football team specially arranged a friendly match against the Holders team during the National Day holiday at Shen Yuan. Tung Wah, with the addition of Gu Shangxiang and the return of Chen Jiaqiu, seemed stronger than before. However, Lu Zhong'en's goalkeeping showed considerable nervousness, and Feng Yunyou's prowess had diminished compared to the past. The midfielders and forwards were all good. Wan Xianghua did not play on this day. The first half ended scoreless. In the second half, after Tung Wah conceded a goal due to a careless mistake by goalkeeper Lu, they relied on Dai Linjing and Li Yichen's final efforts to win 2-1. The audience was very enthusiastic, making it the first grand occasion of the new autumn football season.</p>
<p>Holders kicked off and took an early lead, surprising Tung Wah. Tung Wah launched fierce attacks on the opponent's goal. The forwards' short passes were beautiful and their attacks were swift, drawing cheers from the audience. Li Yichen made a header and a shot, and Feng Yunyou made a long-range attack, although they did not score, they won the approval of the whole stadium and gave the opponents a scare. After about ten minutes, the Holders broke free and a forward penetrated Tung Wah's defenses from the right, disturbing Tung Wah's flanks. Mao Lin charged left and right in front of the goal, trying to score but failing, thanks to the defensive efforts of Li Ning and Guan Xun'an.</p>
<p>The Holders attacked again from the right wing, with Curtis sprinting and sending a high ball to the front of the goal. Mao Lin headed the ball to the front, and A Qiao used lightning-fast speed to head the ball as well. Fortunately, Lu was quick-eyed and quick-handed, catching the ball and averting the danger. The ball flowed back and forth in the field like a meteor, and the pace was fast-paced and the situation was quite tense. Both sides' midfielders had solid defenses that were difficult to break through quickly. Lu Zhong'en's goalkeeping, however, showed considerable nervousness, causing spectators to sweat.</p>
<p>Chen Hongguang threw the ball from the sideline, and the ball bounced back from Jiaqiu's head. Hongguang kicked the ball long towards the opponent's goal. Dai Linjing, being marked by the opponent, cleverly lobbed the ball high, and Yichen immediately ran up and headed it, but unfortunately it bounced off the crossbar. Qiu Ting rushed up to attack again but was stopped by the goalkeeper. Zhou Guangzhong kicked a high ball from the left, unintentionally creating an excellent opportunity, as the ball landed right in front of the goal, but it was saved by Herbert. After half an hour, A Qiao got the ball on the left wing and broke through Tung Wah's defense, reaching the goalmouth. At this critical moment, Li Ning rushed up from the side and tackled A Qiao, and Lu Zhong'en seized the opportunity to grab the ball and escape danger.</p>
<p>The first half passed uneventfully. At the start of the second half, both sides made changes to their lineups. Zhou Guangzhong was replaced by Cao Qiuting on Tung Wah's left wing. Jia Youliang replaced the right wing. The Holders also replaced Curtis on the right wing with the mediocre Li Queshi, greatly reducing their strength. Dai Linjing made a solo run, attacking the opponent's goal from an oblique angle. Unexpectedly, the ball went straight at the goalkeeper, who caught it safely. Yichen showed off his skills, dribbling left and right in front of the opponent's goal, trying to find an opportunity to score, but the opponent's marking was very tight, and there was no gap to exploit. The performance of both sides was not as good as before, and the formations were loose and spiritless.</p>
<p>As the game dragged on, a sudden change occurred, like a stimulant for a patient. The Holders took two consecutive corner kicks from the right wing, causing Tung Wah a scare. Tao Lewei sent the ball from the center to the right wing, then back to the front of the goal. At this time, Tung Wah's midfield formation was chaotic, and Mao Lin took the opportunity to shoot, but the ball was weak. Lu Zhong'en dived to catch the ball but was slow, and A Qiao rushed up and pushed the ball into the net, giving them the lead. The spectators were stunned and laughed.</p>
<p>After misfortune comes good fortune, and fortune and misfortune are unpredictable. Had Tung Wah not conceded this goal, perhaps they would not have been motivated to attack. Therefore, after this mistake, Tung Wah rallied and won 2-1. Tung Wah kicked off from the center and launched an attack. Within three minutes, Jiaqiu received a high ball from Yichen from the sideline and passed it to Linjing. Dai kicked hard at the goal, catching the opponent off guard. The ball grazed goalkeeper Herbert and went into the net, tying the score. After a long period of maneuvering, as time was about to run out, Li Yichen made a solo run, shooting obliquely from the right corner. The ball was fast and went straight into the corner of the net. Herbert could not save it, and Tung Wah scored another goal, winning 2-1. The lineups were as follows:</p>

<p>The Shanghai International Track and Field Games organized by the National Sports Promotion Association were originally scheduled to be held on Double Tenth National Day. However, the original venue was taken back by the landlord, American Luo, and the event could not be held as scheduled. The Association is now working hard to build a qualified track and field venue within the Shen Yuan football field, which will be completed by the end of this month. The aim is to continue the development of Shanghai's grand international track and field movement, and the Shanghai International Games will also be held at that time. A meeting of representatives from various countries is scheduled to be held next Monday (the 15th) at Shen Yuan. We hope that our male and female athletes will train hard in time to bring glory to the country at that time.</p>

<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Not Understanding the Wanderer, He Peeks Through the Door and Pities the Young Girl; Wishing to Hear of Hardships, He Cherishes the Jade and Visits the Poor Family.</p>
<p>This Little Western Paradise Inn, being the largest inn in Xi'an City, naturally had important people coming and going, as well as insignificant people. Li Shilian and Jia Duocai, having eaten their fill, walked back feeling somewhat drunk and uncomfortable. They intended to return to their room and go to sleep. As they walked into their courtyard, they saw a glass-covered kerosene lamp hanging under the eaves, its glass shade swaying in the air, and the dim yellow light moving on the walls. In that light, they saw three people standing in the middle of the courtyard. One was the inn's tea server, whom they could see clearly. Another was a girl of about twenty, wearing a short jacket that barely covered her belly and a black skirt hiked up above her knees, revealing her snow-white thighs in leggings. Her hair was also cut short, flat at the back of her head. She was clearly a modern girl from beyond Tongguan. Although they couldn't see her face clearly in the kerosene lamp light, they could see the rouge on her cheeks, smeared in red patches, almost reaching her ears. She was standing very close to the tea server, chattering away. A modern girl standing in a dimly lit place and talking so intimately with an inn's tea server could not be a good thing. Li Shilian walked towards his room, glancing at the girl. The girl happened to turn her head and, seeing someone paying attention to her, seemed to smile faintly, but unfortunately, it was not clear in the darkness. (37)</p>
<h3 id="e181">Thirteen Abacuses All Became Nines <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Xue</p>
<p>Peng Zu Needs to Reincarnate Five Hundred Times to Finish</p>
<p>Among the Freshmen in the university dormitories, there were people from Sichuan, Fujian, and mostly from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong.</p>
<p>A Shaoxing classmate said, "If we had a thirteen-digit abacus here, and we added to it one by one, how long would it take to add it until every digit became a nine?" A classmate replied without hesitation, "Probably ten years." The Shaoxing person shook his head, indicating that it was far off. Others guessed twenty or thirty years, forty or fifty years, or even a hundred years, but the Shaoxing person shook his head each time. Among them, a certain gentleman who was studious and thoughtful pondered for a while and said with a smile, "If a person could use an abacus from the moment they were born, and worked on the abacus for ten hours a day, except for sleeping, eating, and relieving themselves, until they died at the age of one hundred, they would still need to reincarnate four thousand times, and experience four hundred thousand years, to make every digit of the thirteen-digit abacus a nine." People said he was lying and asked him to demonstrate a practical method.</p>
<p>The gentleman calmly said, "If we can make two movements on the abacus's units digit every second, adding two ones, then we can add 120 in one minute, 7200 in one hour, 72000 in ten hours of work a day, 2,160,000 in one month, 25,920,000 in one year, and 2,592,000,000 in one hundred years. To get to 9,999,999,999,999, we would need to add 2,592,000,000,000 for four hundred thousand years. So, wouldn't a centenarian need four thousand lifetimes to finish? Even if we asked the eight-hundred-year-old Peng Zu to use the abacus, he would need to reincarnate five hundred times to complete the task of making every digit of the thirteen-digit abacus a nine."</p>

<p>A certain lady proposed to break off her engagement to her fiancé. The fiancé said, "I haven't mistreated you! For you, I spent thousands of dollars, for you, I lost a good job, for you, I was kicked out of my family, for you..." The lady impatiently said, "I'm breaking up with you precisely because you lost your job, because you were kicked out of your family, and because you don't have any money to spend on me anymore!"</p>
<h3 id="e183">Daughter's Classic and Women's Issues <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Wei</p>
<p>The *Daughter's Classic* is a book for women from the feudal era. It's all about how girls should conduct themselves, how to learn the Three Obediences and Four Virtues, how to be good wives and mothers, how to emulate the virtuous women of the past, and how a girl should live her life. From her daily life, diet, work, hygiene, to her thoughts and behaviors, it provides extremely detailed explanations, so that a girl who understands it transforms her thoughts and views on life into a single archetype, forever confined to a dark room, subject to the control and threat of old morals.</p>
<p>However, times have changed, and feudal old ideas have become the dregs of the era. A woman living in this modern society receives equal treatment and opportunities as a man. Women in the present era are considered liberated, able to socialize openly, be economically independent, and obtain employment based on their abilities and skills to solve their livelihood problems just like men.</p>
<p>However, every society has its own deformed development defects, so the issue of women's paths in life has both its extremely bright side and its extremely dark side. Naturally, modern women's issues are clearly more complex and difficult to deal with than before due to different social environments and ways of thinking.</p>
<p>I heard that the Star Film Company recently made a film called *Daughter's Classic*, which takes modern women's issues as its central theme and gives great inspiration. In it, it uses Double Tenth Day as a backdrop to delicately depict the joys and harmonies, as well as the tragic sorrows, that many women encounter in life, and points out a path to a correct answer. I think this should be the most suitable "bible" that modern women should definitely read!</p>

<p>When a locomotive starts, the large iron arms of the steam engine drive the wheels on the tracks, making a special sound. Hangzhou people imitate it, saying, "Eat it all, pawn it all! Eat it all, pawn it all!"</p>
<p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::</p>
<p>The firecrackers set off during the New Year make two sounds, one up and one down. Shaoxing people say, "The first sound is 'Poor!' The second sound is 'Gao!' (In the Shaoxing dialect, 'Gao' refers to death or completion)."</p>
<p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::</p>
<p>There are many blacksmith shops outside Fuzhou City, and they are still hammering iron late into the night. They often have three people each holding a long-handled hammer, swinging and striking in succession. Fuzhou people use their local dialect to imitate it, saying, "Enemy steals food, enemy steals food."</p>
<p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::</p>
<p>People in the Xiamen and Zhangzhou areas imitate the sound of cicadas like this: "Weave tightly, weave tightly! Weave tightly, weave tightly!" (Meaning to quickly weave to prepare for the cold, and the sound is very similar.)</p>
<p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::</p>
<p>Northerners imitate the sound of Jiangxi people mending bowls, saying "Zi Gu Zi" (meaning "taking care of oneself").</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fortunately, Qing Shan and the others had some foresight. Before the Empress Dowager set off, they had already informed the officials here, giving them plenty of time to carefully renovate this dilapidated county town, lest the Empress Dowager be displeased when she saw it. So, when the Empress Dowager ordered to inspect the city, everyone was not too flustered. After all, with eight or nine days of effort, no matter how incompetent these local officials were, they should have made some progress. At that time, their group, like the group at Tianjin Station, dressed in opulent clothing and respectfully prostrated themselves beside the station to welcome the Empress Dowager. However, their ranks were very low, and none of them caught the Empress Dowager's attention. As a result, they might as well have made the trip for nothing, only making the station more lively. Perhaps they didn't even see the Empress Dowager's face!</p>
<p>To everyone's surprise, after departing from the station, the highest-ranking local official led the way, slowly proceeding along several of the wider main roads. These streets were usually very dirty, but today they were all covered with a layer of yellow sand, completely hiding their original ugliness. Although I don't know what the Empress Dowager thought of this, I myself was really very unhappy with this temporary fix. Chinese people never want to put in the effort to do things properly early on, but always love to use clever methods at the last minute to gloss over the situation: this is a perfect example! Later, we passed a city gate, and Zhuan Hu Fa saw through this kind of illness. Because the engineering of the city gate was relatively more difficult, even with seven or eight days of preparation, it was impossible to renovate it, because it had been allowed to collapse without any repairs. It could only be left to stand there, crooked like a decrepit old man. (147)</p>

<h3 id="e187">Early Qing Dynasty Prices in Shanghai (Part 2) <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Shanghai Correspondent</p>
<p>Ten, Sugar: Top-grade white cane sugar was worth three to four fen of silver per catty in the late Ming Dynasty. During the Shunzhi reign, due to frequent maritime conflicts, the price rose to four qian of silver per catty. It was not until the Kangxi reign that sugar prices returned to their former levels. In the winter of the 20th year of Kangxi, white sugar was worth three fen of silver per catty, and brown sugar was only worth about one fen. By the 25th year of Kangxi, it became even cheaper, costing only 20 wen per catty, which was less than two fen of silver.</p>
<p>Eleven, Porcelain: Porcelain from Jiangxi was originally very precious. During the Chongzhen era, the finest quality items were worth three to five qian of silver each, while inferior items could be bought for about three to five fen of silver for ten pieces. In the early Shunzhi period, when Jiangnan was just pacified but military affairs had not ceased, porcelain could not be transported to Shanghai, so prices rose sharply. Even the worst quality bowls were worth four to five fen of silver each. At this time, wealthy families in Shanghai switched to using copper or tin utensils, while the poor had to use bamboo or wooden bowls. In the early Kangxi period, porcelain was once very cheap, with even the best quality items costing no more than one qian of silver. In the 13th year of Kangxi, due to Wu Sangui's rebellion, bandits rose up everywhere in Jiangyou (Jiangxi), and porcelain became very expensive again, just like in the early Shunzhi period. It was not until after the 27th year that prices returned to the low levels of the early Kangxi era.</p>
<p>Twelve, Ge Cloth (Kudzu Cloth): Ge cloth was mostly transported from Zhejiang, Guangdong, Jiangxi and other provinces. In the Ming Dynasty, it was originally for the use of gentry, scholars and officials, not ordinary people, so a bolt more than three zhang long was worth three taels of silver. By the Qing Dynasty, the quality of ge cloth gradually deteriorated, and the price also fell day by day. After the establishment of the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai in the 24th year of Kangxi and the opening of the sea ban, merchant ships gathered, and ge cloth became more and more abundant. The best quality was worth no more than one fen and five or six li of silver per chi, and the inferior quality was only worth seven or eight li per chi.</p>
<p>Thirteen, Cocoon Silk: Cocoon silk mostly came from Shandong, with the best quality being produced on pepper trees. In the late Ming Dynasty, the price was exceptionally expensive, worth about one tael of silver per chi. In the early Qing Dynasty, Jiahu (Jiaxing and Huzhou), Suzhou and Songjiang all imitated weaving, so the price became very cheap. The best quality was no more than one qian of silver per chi, and the second-best quality could be bought for three to four fen of silver per chi.</p>
<p>Fourteen, Eyeglasses: Since the Ming Dynasty, Western goods had arrived, with eyeglasses costing four to five taels of silver per pair. However, the goods were very scarce, and it was not easy for ordinary wealthy families to purchase them. After the Shunzhi period, Suzhou and Hangzhou were able to imitate them, so they were sold everywhere. The best quality only cost seven to eight fen of silver per pair, and the worst quality cost no more than two to three fen. However, Western nearsightedness eyeglasses still cost two taels of silver to buy a pair.</p>
<p>Fifteen, Seafood: In the early Qing Dynasty, the only type of seafood sold in Shanghai shops with a verifiable price was bird's nest. In the late Ming Dynasty, the price was eight qian of silver per catty. During the Shunzhi period, the price was about the same. After the Kangxi period, it became very expensive, costing four taels of silver per catty. From then on, it was rarely used except in the most extravagant banquets.</p>
<p>Sixteen, Stationery: Bamboo paper, seventy-five sheets per dao, was worth two fen of silver during the Chongzhen period. In the early Shunzhi period and the 13th year of Kangxi, due to the turmoil in Fujian, the price rose to one qian and four or five fen per dao. After the 26th year of Kangxi, it returned to the old price of two fen per dao, but the number of sheets was only seventy. Vermilion inksticks, each box weighing fourteen taels, cost eight to nine taels of silver in the early Shunzhi period, but only cost two qian and five fen in the early Kangxi period. The best-quality Qingtian frozen stone for seals cost only a little more than one tael of silver per liang. Inkstones made from Suzhou Guanyin Mountain stone could be worth two to three qian of silver each.</p>
<p>Seventeen, Medicinal Materials: Most medicinal materials were not produced locally. In the early Kangxi period, due to the unresolved military affairs in Sichuan and Guangdong, the market prices of several essential medicines soared unexpectedly. For example, aconite could sell for dozens of taels of silver per piece, turmeric cost more than two hundred taels per liang, and cinnamon also cost twelve to thirteen taels. By the Kangxi period, after peace was restored in all directions, aconite only cost one qian of silver per piece, turmeric only cost eight fen per liang, and cinnamon only cost five taels per catty.</p>
<p>Eighteen, Fragrant Spices: In the late Ming Dynasty, sandalwood cost four to five qian of silver per catty, and agarwood cost less than one qian per catty. In the early Shunzhi period, the prices were four times higher, and ordinary wealthy families hardly used them lightly. In the 18th year of Kangxi, it was rumored that sandalwood was used in the palace to wash utensils, so the market price plummeted to only two qian of silver per catty, and Daoists still mostly prohibited its use when setting up altars and building temples. Due to the great opening of the sea market, agarwood was transported in large quantities, and the price returned to its original state in the late Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of Shanghai prices from the late Ming Dynasty to the early Qing Dynasty, forty to fifty years, recorded in the Shanghai County Annals, Dong Han's "San Gang Shi Lue," Ye Mengzhu's "Yue Shi Bian," Yao Tinglin's "Ji Shi," and other books, which are excellent historical materials for studying the social and economic conditions of Shanghai in the early Qing Dynasty.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Financial Silver Prices Soar Continuously, Standard Gold Plummets to 18 Yuan 6 Jiao <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Reaching a New Low of 901 Yuan 1 Jiao</p>
<p>Central Bank Interventions Offer Some Support Mid-Market</p>
<p>Due to the continuous surge in overseas silver markets and persistent selling pressure, the gold market yesterday reached a new low of 901 yuan and 1 jiao. According to foreign wire reports, the British and American silver markets rose significantly. Although London spot gold remained flat, exchange rates narrowed, and U.S. prices rose, market sentiment remained extremely fearful. Reports of the assassinations of the French Foreign Minister and the King of Yugoslavia caused an immediate drop upon market opening. Off-market pre-market trading struggled around 10 yuan, creating considerable confusion. After opening, prices rebounded from the lows but failed to break through the 10-yuan mark. As a result, the foreign exchange market was loose and oversupplied. Despite the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's (HSBC) upward adjustments to both British and American exchange rates, market sentiment remained weak, gradually trending downward. However, there were numerous struggles along the way. Due to the extremely uneasy sentiment among bulls, even substantial support proved ineffective. The foreign exchange market fueled selling pressure, hardening repeatedly. Supply in the market exceeded demand, and buyers were temporarily constrained, causing a sharp decline to a new low of 902 yuan and 2 jiao. Subsequently, the wave of liquidations gradually subsided, and bargain hunters began to become active. Banks also seized the opportunity to consolidate positions, gradually pushing up gold prices. By noon, a sudden rally emerged, and market sentiment slightly strengthened, with the underlying trend turning positive. The market displayed a demand-exceeding-supply situation, with buying interest seemingly reviving. The noon close was stable. In the afternoon market, the opening price was lower due to loosened domestic trading. Although there was an initial dip, market sentiment remained relatively positive, leading to a rebound after the low. However, upon news of a rise in Bombay gold prices, selling pressure returned, causing a pullback. Despite some consolidation, market sentiment lacked vigor, and the overall trend gradually weakened. Further news from Bombay, reporting a rise of one anna, a fall of one anna, and then no change, led to a slight rebound after the low, but market sentiment ultimately trended downward, with many participants liquidating positions. Before the close, another new low of 901 yuan and 1 jiao was reached. Overall market sentiment was weak. The Central Bank's intermittent interventions with spot gold offered some stimulus to buyers, resulting in some rebound strength. However, the overall trend was perceived as deteriorating, and most bulls were hesitant to try easily, ultimately making it difficult to sustain. The difference between the December new standard and the old standard reached 2.5 yuan. Rumors circulated in the market that certain major speculators were planning significant downward moves. The day's market conditions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 908 yuan and 2 jiao, a sharp drop of 12 yuan and 1 jiao compared to the previous closing. The foreign exchange market opened with near-term selling prices: British exchange at 1 shilling 6 pence, and U.S. exchange at 36 yuan 75 fen.

Dacheng, Hengyu, Fuchang, Qingyu, Bingxing, Yuqing, and Yongqing took advantage of the high prices to exit, retreating to 7 yuan 5 jiao. Banque Belge (Hua Bi) took December U.S. dollars at 37 yuan. Fuyu, Fuchang, Hengchang, Yongfu, Xingyong, Da, and Decheng submitted orders, pushing the price back up to 9 yuan 4 jiao. Dingchang, Tongyi, Yuanmao, and Yongyuan also took positions. The price rebounded from 8 yuan 2 jiao to 9 yuan 3 jiao. HSBC announced a listing price increase of 0.25 for British exchange and 0.4375 for U.S. exchange, gradually trending downward. Hengyu and Dafayong sold off, retreating to within 8 yuan. Hengyu, Yuankang, Xiangyuanxing sold down to 6 yuan 3 jiao.

Zhaofengchang, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Richang, Yuanchang, Yongtian, and Tianfeng submitted orders, pushing the price back up to 6 yuan. However, with shaky buyer sentiment and continued selling pressure, buyers seemed overwhelmed and struggled to gain traction, further weakening the gold market. Yuanmao, Yongdaxing, Yongfutai, Hengshun, and Mao sold off, pushing the domestic market further down to 2 yuan 2 jiao. Bargain hunters became more eager. Banque Belge took January U.S. dollars at 375. Fuchang, Hengyu, Hengchang, Yongda, Decheng, Qingyu, Fuan, Fuxingyong, and others successively purchased orders. Meifeng took January U.S. dollars at 0.025, then rebounded to 6 yuan 8 jiao. Dafayong and Zhaofengchang exited at high prices, dropping back to 5 yuan 1 jiao. Suddenly, market sentiment reversed. Fuxingyong, Yuanchunyuan, Yongtianfeng, and Yongli Dingkang submitted orders, pushing the price even higher to 8 yuan 7 jiao. Wanxing, Yuanmao, Yongyicheng slightly sold off, retreating to 7 yuan 7 jiao. The noon closing was at 908 yuan 1 jiao. Market sentiment weakened slightly after the close.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 907 yuan 7 jiao. Banque Belge set November shillings at 0.1875. Fuxingyongfeng, Changyuanchang, and Yong sold to 5 yuan 7 jiao. Hengyu Dadecheng rose to 6 yuan 8 jiao. Fuchang Yuanchang Yong sold again to 5 yuan 7 jiao. Market sentiment stabilized.

Yuanxing Dadecheng Yuanchun Hengyu Fuyu took the opportunity to sell off, and fell back to 4 yuan 1 jiao. Bombay's second rise and fall were slight. Dafayong Hongli returned to 5 yuan 5 jiao. Market sentiment was weak. Yuanmao Yong Qingfa Yong Yuqing Yong Dadecheng Fuxing Yong Yifeng Yong sold orders, down to 1.5 yuan. Shunmao Dadecheng took advantage of the cheap to take the order, rising to 2 yuan 7 jiao. Dafayong Dachang Xiang Dingchang Hengxing Yuan Hongli Tongfeng Heng came to sell again, and fell even more to 1 yuan 1 jiao. Fuyu's order was closed at 901 yuan 7 jiao. After the market closed, Fuyu, etc. were still Naha. With Taisales, the trend was stable. It was found that the highest price of the day was 909 yuan 8 jiao, and the lowest price was 901 jiao, with a total of 8 yuan and 7 jiao. As a result, it was 18 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<p>The December new standard is still transferred to the old standard. There are still many transfer sales in the market. Fuyu Futai Heng Tongchun Huixiang and others will pay Wanxing and others a difference of 2.5 yuan and 2 yuan. The morning opening was 908 yuan and 2 jiao, the noon closing was 8 yuan 1 jiao, the afternoon opening was 7 yuan 7 jiao, and the closing was 901 yuan and 7 jiao, which was also 18 yuan and 6 jiao from the previous closing.</p>
<p>Settlement price: The HSBC Bank's U.S. exchange rate is 4375, which is 36 yuan and 25 yuan, and the combined standard gold price is 954 yuan. According to the closing price, it is about 53 yuan, which is about 7 yuan lower than the previous closing.

<p>丨Yesterday's Bond Trend Stabilized</p>
<p>Yesterday, the domestic environmental news of the Chinese Stock Exchange was relatively good. The impact of the review of the King of Yugoslavia and the French Foreign Minister on the Southwest on the Fifth Plenary Session was limited. The market popularity was relatively stable, and the buying was better than the selling. The trend was changed from soft to strong, and the shorts were in a hurry to short. However, the good side was also limited, because those who waited for the price to sell were real people. At most, the range of the coil will be enlarged, and the big rise and fall are still waiting for the changes in the environment. After yesterday's pass, the opening was mostly small one or two corners, among which there were also slightly better ones. The second pass waited for small one or two corners, and the beginning and end were still unable to be consistent. On the market, the sellers mostly used No. 9 and No. 78, and the afternoon situation changed yesterday. The opening, except for the slight reduction in staffing, all returned to one or two corners from the previous time, and the closing generally tended to rise two or three corners. On the market, the buyers seemed to be mostly No. 23, 33 and 50, and the like. In general, the coil has not been removed, and the trend has slightly turned. As a result of the market price, the gains and losses were also mixed. Most of the front row was 5 cents to 20 cents smaller, and the back row started from the 20th level, and rose from 12 cents to 40 cents. The total number of transactions was 10.25 million yuan.</p>
<p>The Stock Exchange will also auction a variety of stocks such as China, Jiaotong, Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, Shanghai Commercial, Chinese Electrical, Zhabei Water and Electricity, and Guanghua Oil and Oil from today onwards.

<h3 id="e193">Yarn Flowers - New Sellers of Cotton Yarn Gradually Decreasing <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>丨 Spot Yarn Prices Rise by 50 Cents to 1 Dollar</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm, gradually showing signs of stability. After a sharp drop, it is showing a slight rebound. Most observers believe that the bottom has been reached, and new sellers are decreasing. At the same time, demand for spot yarn remains strong, which has boosted confidence. However, foreign firms are holding steady on their short positions. Some forward trading continues, with Changfeng reportedly selling on the rise.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn: The market opened calmly. The previous day's drop of 15 points in U.S. cotton caused some concern, but the subsequent rebound yesterday raised spirits somewhat. Positive news about spot yarn also contributed to a calmer market sentiment. As a result, near months rose by 1.6 cents, mid-months were flat, and far months fell by 1.4 cents. In the afternoon, it was reported that 2,500 bales were sold to customers, and various groups were considering further purchases. Sellers were relatively scarce, and many shorts were covering their positions in the near months, strengthening the market. The far months followed suit. Consequently, all months rose by 5.6 cents. However, Changfeng sold over 2,000 bales alone. Total daily trading volume was 29,700 bales. Sales included Dafu 1,000 bales, Tongji 450 bales, Gengfeng 1,500 bales, Changfeng 2,600 bales, Xiesheng 450 bales, Yichang 1,250 bales, and Xincheng 650 bales. Purchases included Tongfu 900 bales, Hengyi 500 bales, Dafeng 2,450 bales, Jinchang 800 bales, Renfeng 550 bales, Changfeng 650 bales, Xincheng 800 bales, Tongxing 900 bales, and Yongda 450 bales.

<p>Dafu Purchases Over 10,000 Dan</p>
<p>The cotton market initially strengthened and then flattened out, but the overall tone was more subdued as new cotton from various regions gradually entered the market and selling prices were moderate due to slow absorption by mills. However, large buyers remained bullish and firmly held onto their acquisitions. Some anticipated a potential turnaround in U.S. cotton prices.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Tong Gang Makes Large-Scale Coverings <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Standard Cotton opened higher due to a 15 point rebound in U.S. cotton, boosting sentiment. However, Indian cotton weakened, and new buying was limited, leading to a softening after the second or third trading session. News of weaker spot prices in Hankou also contributed to the decline. As a result, all months fell by 5 cents to 2 dimes. In the afternoon session, market conditions remained flat, but large-scale covering by the Tongzhou group tightened the market. Simultaneously, the yarn market rebounded, pushing cotton prices higher at the close. Consequently, all months rose by 5 cents to 1.5 dimes. Total daily trading volume was estimated at 76,800 dan. Sales included Yichang 1,800 dan, Changji 1,000 dan, Jifeng 2,000 dan, Tongji 1,000 dan, Hengyi 1,600 dan, Dafeng 1,300 dan, Suilong 2,200 dan, Taixing 1,100 dan, Shenchang 1,400 dan, Ruidai 1,100 dan, Yuande 1,000 dan, Changfeng 5,700 dan, Xincheng 1,200 dan, Changhe 1,500 dan, and Yuanxingchang 2,100 dan.

<p>On the 9th (Sunday), U.S. cotton weakened due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, selling by foreign firms, and a downturn on Wall Street. Spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures fell by 11-14 points. British cotton futures fell by 11-12 points. Indian cotton weakened due to large-scale long liquidation and speculative selling. Pingle fell by 2 rupees, Omra fell by 3.25 rupees, and White Rawxi fell by 2.75 rupees.</p>
<p>On the 10th (Monday), sentiment for U.S. cotton was good. The government denied abandoning production restrictions, which boosted the market. The opening was initially slightly weak due to low Liverpool cables and overseas selling, but quickly rebounded, aided by strong overseas market conditions. Prices rose by about one dollar per bale. Southern selling decreased, and the number of sell orders in the market gradually dwindled. The closing was quite stable. As a result, spot prices rose by 15 points, and futures rose by 15-20 points. British cotton futures fell by 7-8 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to long liquidation and speculative selling, but strengthened later due to purchases by European exporters. Consequently, Pingle fell by 1.25 rupees, Omra fell by 3 rupees, and White Rawxi fell by 2.75 rupees.</p>

<p>Flour: After the market opened yesterday, prices for all months immediately rose due to a rise of about one dollar in foreign wheat prices. Sentiment was uniformly positive. Continued mill shutdowns further fueled the market. Seeing that the mills had stopped selling, hoarders and customer groups took the opportunity to buy, so in the afternoon session, all months continued to rise. The upward trend became even more intense before the close. The mills made some sales, but the market remained firm. Closing prices: October up 3 points, November up 5 points, December up 5.15 points, January up 4.5 points, February up 3.75 points.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market remained firm in both the morning and afternoon sessions, as customers and hoarders had been inquiring recently. Foreign wheat cable news yesterday was positive, up about one dollar. Spot foreign wheat was also around 4.60 dollars, showing no signs of decline. New shorts and hoarders were not selling. Later, as the flour market rose, the wheat market became even more stable. Closing prices: October, November, and December all up 5 points, January up 3 points, and February up 6 points. Existing spot wheat inventory remains ample. Yesterday, brokers were asking for a 5-cent increase, but the mills did not inquire due to new imports of foreign wheat.</p>

<p>Local Street Purchases Actively</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign and domestic xian rice was very active. Various groups from Jiujiang and other inland areas were inquiring, and local street purchases were even more active. The total market offering was 7,200 bags of foreign and domestic xian rice and 1,800 bags of foreign rice, plus 50 tons of futures foreign rice. While there were inquiries for domestic xian rice from Jiujiang and other inland areas, actual demand was not strong. The market was initially on a gradual upward trend. Yesterday, local streets actively purchased domestic coarse rice, with a total transaction volume of over 4,000 bags. Local streets purchased it, milled it into white rice, and directly distributed it to the Jiujiang group, making the market more buoyant. There were also over 1,000 bags of direct purchases of domestic unpolished xian rice for loading by the Jiujiang group. Inland areas accommodated both unpolished and polished rice. Recently, due to weak actual demand, prices gradually increased by 7-8 cents to about 1 dime.</p>
<p>The inventory of foreign rice is relatively large, with customers inactive and hoarding appetite stalled. However, there are still ongoing order requests, so sentiment remains weak. Yesterday, local streets made some accommodations, and prices slightly decreased by 5 cents. The prices of futures production are stable, with limited trading activity. A total of 50 tons of repurchased goods were offered, with October priced at 4.60 dollars, also purchased by local streets.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Kiln-Seed Baige Suddenly Drops by Half a Dollar <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various groups suddenly stopped discharging, resulting in an accumulation of arrivals, totaling more than 40 companies (nearly 7,000 shi), with kiln-seed rice being the most, followed by Baige rice. The remaining goods were limited. Local streets had a strong appetite for kiln-seed rice, and there were even Qingdao and Yantai groups purchasing 600-700 bags. However, the overall situation became one of oversupply, causing sentiment to soften and prices to drop sharply by half a dollar. At the same time, Baige rice also declined in response. Initially, thin-skinned new japonica rice, such as White Rice, had limited arrivals, making the situation tight. However, it was later affected by kiln-seed rice and did not show a bright outlook. Only new Du foreign pointed rice, due to inland sources all going to Zhejiang Province, resulted in a shortage of Shanghai goods, making it rare and valuable, and the market was uniquely buoyant. Other varieties, such as broken rice, showed a mixed market trend, with inconsistent price increases and decreases. Metayin wine shops had limited intake, so the market depended on the strength of sales in rice shops, with sales being strong if the rice suited their tastes, otherwise, it was difficult to sell even at discounted prices.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) In the past two days, 36-37 ships arrived at various ports. Various colors of new japonica Yangdu sharp, aged Hakka sharp, and small quantities had good sales on the market. Kiln-seed short rice had a slight outlet, broken rice moved slightly, and aged white rice, new metayin rice, and new port pointed rice also had relatively smooth sales. New japonica prices were high by about 1 dime. New Yangdu sharp, new port pointed, and aged Hakka sharp also showed tightness. Broken rice, aged white rice, new metayin rice prices were stable. Kiln seed short rice was 2-3 dimes lower.</p>
<h3 id="e201">New Pudong Du Soybeans Hit the Market <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>New Sesame Seeds Arrive, Sales are Strong</p>
<p>New Pudong Du soybeans were transported for the first time on National Day, arriving at about 20 dan. Yesterday, more than 10 dan continued to arrive. This year's Gengzao soybeans are inferior to last year's. The appearance is still good, but the seeds are uneven. The price is 8 dollars, purchased by local streets. New sesame seeds arrive, and sales are strong. The market is stable. The arrivals included Dangshan sesame 57 bags, Guandian snow sesame 50 bags, Peng sesame 203 bags, Nanjing sesame 350 bags, Haozhou sesame 110 bags, Yangzhou sesame 102 bags, and Zhangbaling sesame 60 bags. Please see the market price column for prices. The destination is local streets in Shantou and Guangdong. The aged sesame market is also good. Aged yellow soybeans are strong as the factories continue to purchase for cake sales. Therefore, the soybean market has turned up. The market conditions of the past two days have risen by more than 2 dimes compared to when it was depressed. Yesterday, 11-12 carts of Haozhou soybeans were sold, with prices ranging from 2.98 to 2.99 dollars. Over 200 bags of Guidou soybeans went to inland areas, with prices opening at 3.04 dollars. New soybeans are relatively softer, as their source is readily available, and sales are not strong, so sentiment remains weak.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Sugar Market - Raw Sugar and White Sugar Plunge by 3.5 Dimes <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was weighed down by the continued decline of Customs Gold by 5 points to 1.832, while the Dutch exchange rate increased to 54 dollars, causing widespread pessimism and a sharp drop in prices. The association's designated price for ordinary spot 24 raw sugar and white sugar was 18.30 dollars, a decrease of 3.5 dimes compared to the previous day (October 9). Prices for re-exported goods fell by a similar amount to 5.30 dollars. Dutch Red sugar was not willing to follow the decline due to limited inventory. Spot prices were 13.60 to 13.55 dollars, and re-exported goods were quoted at 4.75 dollars. Zhenyu No. 1 refined white sugar from the local factory was 17 dollars, No. 2 was 16.80 dollars, No. 3 was 16.60 dollars, and No. 4 was 16.45 dollars. There were no transactions for these grades. There is still a possibility of further declines in 24 raw sugar and white sugar, as sales have not improved despite the price drop.</p>

<p>Due to the low price of the first batch of Quanzhou Pao Yuan that arrived in the second batch, the cargo owners were unwilling to continue selling, so the auctions were postponed for several days. As the purchasing party has agreed to increase the price, it has been decided to convene the exchanges to discuss and evaluate the price this morning. It is expected that the market will rise.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai was dull. Various foreign firms and traders adopted a wait-and-see attitude due to the recent high exchange rates. Only Fushi, Jardine Matheson, and Xiehe and other firms purchased about 500 boxes of green tea, such as Luzhuang Zhenmei and Zhenmei Needle, and the market was unusually quiet. Selling prices also fell by 2-3 dollars compared to last week. However, low-grade Gongxi Xiumei and other items saw slightly increased sales to Tianjin and Shandong groups, and tea warehouses had quite a few scattered sales. It is reported that over 2,000 boxes have already been shipped out this week.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Life at Twenty <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Xi</p>
<p>The Japanese author Natsume Soseki once said, "One knows the benefits of life at twenty," which roughly means that ordinary people, having lived in this world for twenty years, understand the value of living and the joy of living. I cannot agree with this statement!</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, I have just reached this age this year, but I have never experienced this "benefit of life"! On the contrary, the idea that "life is not easy" is what I have been deeply tasting recently!</p>
<p>All of life's burdens and worries are like heavy bags of sand and stones pressing on the thin backs of laborers. At this point, they begin to tighten on our shoulders, making us feel that there is only suffering in the world! This suffering is often hidden from those under twenty by the colorful dreams of childhood!</p>
<p>Twenty years of heat and cold easily erode a person's childhood innocence and simplicity! At this time, he will begin to know that life is not as beautiful or easy as he imagined in the past! Before the age of twenty, people probably all lived with a slight smile. To tear apart this smile and make you believe that "things in life rarely go as you wish" is what this time is all about, making it impossible for you to smile.</p>
<p>Everyone's reason, emotion, and will all want to test their own wings at this age. But this contains a kind of crisis! Reason at twenty easily makes you hit a wall; emotion at twenty easily makes you fall; will at twenty easily makes you feel unfree! From here, a kind of sadness will lightly envelop your heart!</p>
<p>Zhu Guozhen of the Ming Dynasty said in "Yongchuang Small Notes": "After twenty, one is strong and self-reliant, eager to advance, regarding officialdom as easy to obtain, and chasing fame like pursuing goats." For such warriors who want official positions and fame, I can only stretch my neck and envy and bless them! As for myself, my own little wisdom over the past twenty years has made me lack this kind of courage to be "strong and self-reliant, eager to advance"! Although it is said that an official position can be pursued, I always feel that this matter is very difficult! As for "fame," I have never been very eager for it. Gorky said, "The ox has a good reputation, but it still has to fill its belly with hay!" Especially for people like me, fame is just a kind of restraint!</p>
<p>"Relying on parents, happily well-fed and warm, without worry or management, forgetting what is forgotten and lost"—the childlike era like a fairy tale has passed at twenty. After twenty, I have never felt the so-called value or joy of living in the world!</p>
<p>"Embracing the future: sadness always outweighs hope!" This is what I think, having spent twenty years in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Night on the River Bottom (Continued) <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>"Where's Uncle?"</p>
<p>Because I was too bored and lonely in the evening, I asked like this.</p>
<p>"Uncle doesn't live here. He comes back in the middle of the night . . . . Oh, it's burnt. Smell that?" He quickly used the iron tongs to pull apart the fire and took out a piece of corn emitting smoke, acting as if he understood things better than I did.</p>
<p>At this time, the cabin door suddenly opened with a creak, and the dim light from the oil lamp inside the house spilled out like water. The mistress angrily appeared at the door, pulling her second son, who was standing in front of the door, and scolding him:</p>
<p>"You can't leave for a moment, you little devil, you want me to die!"</p>
<p>But looking at her face, the anger seemed to be put on. After walking to the fire and settling her second son with her eldest son, she quickly glanced at me as if to check if I had noticed her peeking at the bundle. I quickly avoided her gaze and took a piece of dry firewood to add to the fire.</p>
<p>"Waa waa waa" Another child burst into tears inside the house; this was the one she had carried inside earlier. She didn't pay any attention to him, only carefully warmed a clay pot filled with something in the fire, while loudly instructing her two children:</p>
<p>"Be careful! If you knock it over, I'll rip off your ears, you little devils!"</p>
<p>It seemed she was also showing off to me, but I found it very funny that she always called her children "little devils."</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because she was making dinner and had been constantly bending over that the baby strapped to her back started to cry along with an untamed yell. At this moment, she took the ladle in her hand, dipped it into the water tank with a slightly broken rim, making a heavy footstep like a man, ran into the house, and carried out the crying third child as if she were carrying a chicken or duck. After giving him a slap, she nimbly wiped his snot with her rough hand that had just hit him, flicking it away. Then, she grabbed the half-eaten corn in her eldest son's hand, scolding:</p>
<p>"You glutton!"</p>
<p>She immediately stuffed the snatched corn into her youngest son's mouth, forcefully blocking his crying mouth. At the same time, she cursed fiercely:</p>
<p>"Cry again! Cry again!"</p>
<p>This third child really stopped crying, but the smallest one crying on her back cried even louder. She reached back and slapped him several times before taking him off her back, opening the hole in her torn clothes in front of her chest, and putting her nipple into the child's small mouth. Thus, everything returned to peace, but the sound of the river behind the house was sent clearly and greatly into the room.</p>
<p>The eldest child, who had been deprived of his corn, first pouted his upper lip and deliberately scattered the small branches burning on the fire with a piece of dry firewood as thick as a wine cup. Then, he suddenly knocked over the water pot that his mother had told him not to touch, and the lid, water, and string beans immediately spilled out, and water vapor and smoke rose heavily.</p>
<p>"Heavens, you little devil, you . . . ."</p>
<p>The mistress started to cry hysterically, and the nursing baby also cried loudly.</p>
<p>The eldest child, who had caused the trouble, was hit by his mother and hid in a dark corner, sobbing softly, not daring to cry out loud.</p>
<p>▲ ▲ ▲</p>
<p>When it was time to sleep, I was led to a small room behind the store (probably where the grooms used to sleep), which emitted a musty smell that had been uninhabited for a long time. Dust-covered spider webs, in the dim yellow light of the vegetable oil lamp, hung like many tassels from the roof and in the four corners. The bed was made of three or four pine planks laid across two long benches. Other than that, there was neither a straw mat nor a cotton quilt.</p>
<p>"How can I sleep like this, landlady?"</p>
<p>I said after looking at the room. The mistress, who had just stepped out of the door, turned around and hugged the baby in her arms, her face stern and cold:</p>

<h3 id="e207">Divine Facial Restoration <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent</p>
<p>In the "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," a judge once replaced the ugly face of a woman with a beautiful one. There is a similar story in the West about a girl named Cinderella. Because she was born with an ugly appearance, her sisters always left her at home to do menial chores and clean up after parties when they went to balls. She was unkempt and ignored by everyone. Later, she moved a fairy, who used magic to transform her into a beautiful woman and took her to a ball where she met a prince who fell in love with her at first sight. When we read these stories, we naturally regard them as tales of gods and monsters. Who would have thought that with the progress of 20th-century science, there would actually be facts that seem similar to these stories?</p>
<p>This type of surgery is called "Plastic Surgery" in the medical field, which can be translated as "sculpting surgery," or simply "facial restoration." This is a new achievement in medical science. According to Professor Matutai, a famous French abdominal surgeon, "In ten or fifteen years, facial restoration will become the most important branch of surgery." Some in the British medical community also predict that in less than ten years, this type of surgery will become as common as general surgery.</p>
<p>It is said that this theory is not newly created. Eastern surgeons were already proficient in this method two thousand years ago, and what is even more surprising is that the method is the same as it is now. In the 16th century, Italian surgeons recorded dozens of cases of "skin grafting" surgery, all with good results. In 1597, Tagliacozzi first wrote a textbook on this technique. As for recent success, it is due to the war. This is indeed one of the few useful products created by the war.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the cruelty of modern warfare. When the flames of war ignite, flesh and blood fly everywhere. But it is over when one dies. The worst thing is to preserve life but be left with crippled limbs, especially incomplete facial features and a loss of original appearance. When family and friends meet, they do not recognize each other. Life is completely devoid of interest. When the European war ended in 1918, there were no less than hundreds of thousands of such wounded soldiers left behind. These became the materials for plastic surgeons to wield their knives and perform their skills. In quiet hospitals, month after month, they reconstructed their faces, restored their human form, and allowed them to no longer be scorned.</p>
<p>The largest of these hospitals is the Sidcup Facial Injuries Hospital, operated by the famous surgeon Sir Harold Gillies. Over several years, a total of 19,000 people were treated. Today, most of the exquisite facial restoration techniques of surgeons have been learned from this hospital. The results are almost unbelievable. A Canadian officer had his jaw blown away by a shell, and half of his face was destroyed. After months of work by the doctors, a new jaw was created for him, and his face was repaired inch by inch, even including his eyebrows. There are dozens of others whose faces have been reshaped to restore their human form. As for filling in deep scars on the face, that is countless. A doctor at the British Pension Department said, "This surgery is truly the work of gods, wonderfully indescribable."</p>
<p>In times of peace, this surgery has been transferred to repairing the damage inflicted on workers' bodies by industrial warfare. It is possible to take good skin, bones, cartilage, or nerves from the body to repair the damaged parts of the person. Let's give an example to illustrate. A chemical worker had a large part of the skin on his face eroded by acid, and it penetrated deep into the flesh. After being treated by a plastic surgeon, his face was first anesthetized with medicine, and the bleeding was stopped. Then the necrotic skin was scraped off, and a liquid was applied to the face, which slowly dried and formed a soft facial mask, becoming a model of the injured area. The model extended to the uninjured skin on the chest. Then, a large piece of skin of appropriate thickness was carefully removed from his body. This was the material for creating a new face. It was laid on the burned flesh, and then stitched firmly to the edges of the good skin. The skin and flesh there will naturally grow well, just like newly transplanted trees, they will naturally come alive. The blood vessels will extend out and connect with the veins and arteries. Once the traces of the stitches are gone, he will work as usual.</p>
<p>The thin skin needed for surgery can be obtained from many parts of the body. The area where the skin is cut will grow new skin in less than a month. Even if it is cut a little deeper, it does not matter, as long as thin skin is taken from elsewhere and laid on it. In the past, surgeons could only transplant small pieces of skin, but after an American doctor invented a method, the area of the skin could be enlarged. He discovered that if the pressure on the transplanted skin is evenly distributed on all sides, it can grow well. The effect of the pressure is to block the external blood supply, allowing the newly connected skin to settle in its own blood and lymph, while its blood vessels will extend out like the fine roots of a plant and connect with the overall flow of circulation.</p>
<p>Plastic surgery is progressing year by year. At first, it was just cutting skin to repair injuries, but now it can take skin, bone, cartilage, and nerves to create new faces and new facial structures. One patient had nerves on his face that could not move, and his face would obviously be stiff for the rest of his life. Later, after the doctor took great pains, he tried to connect nerves, cut open his thigh, took out an unimportant nerve, and connected it to his face, just like connecting broken wires with copper wire. In less than thirty days, the patient's face was able to move flexibly. After resting for a few months, his expressions were no different from ordinary people. This is the result of painstaking and meticulous research. There was also a girl whose face was completely destroyed. The doctor patiently repaired it for her. First, a section of rib was taken and carved into a new set of teeth. Then, a piece of skin was cut from her thigh to create eyelids and nostrils. Then, flesh was taken from the chest to fill the mouth and make lips, and cartilage was borrowed from the skull. After twenty-five "skin grafts," each time the skin had to be placed evenly and with extreme precision. In the end, a new face was created. Now you can meet this happy girl at banquets. In the future, bone grafting will also have amazing results. It is now possible to create a new thumb using the tibia and the flesh under the calf. In the future, it may even be possible to create a new hand.</p>
<p>This new technique, like other sciences, can also produce unexpected strange things. A woman had a torn lip, and the doctor repaired it with skin drooping from her cheek. Unexpectedly, every time her lip moved, she felt a sensation on her cheek. Even stranger, a patient had his throat rotted away, and the doctor repaired it with skin from his neck. Unexpectedly, eighteen months later, he felt uncomfortable swallowing things. It turned out that the new skin had grown whiskers inside... This incident has been confirmed by a medical journal.</p>
<p>In the past, the skin on the face could be tightened to reduce the appearance of aging, which everyone regarded as miraculous. But compared to today's facial restoration surgery, that facelift surgery is nothing. In the future, with the advancement of facial restoration surgery, it is possible that extremely ugly people can be transformed into beautiful ones. At that time, anyone who dislikes being old or ugly will be able to find Judge Lu everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Village Head (II)(X)(IV) <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>"Therefore! Therefore!" Old Mu Ren gulped down a large mouthful of wine and said in a loud voice, "At this time, those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. Think about it, we old folks don't need to be said; the seventy-two strong men in the village, which one doesn't have a large string of old and young hanging behind him, relying on him for food and clothing. One day, they're drafted away. Are we going to let a large string of old and young starve to death? If those with money are unwilling to contribute, then they can only be forced to rebel! Forced onto Liangshan Mountain! At that time, you can't blame us!"</p>
<p>"Alas! Alas!" Mr. Feng Wen, who had been silent for a long time, finally opened his mouth. "The village...alas! Alas!...who can still afford to contribute money? Each family knows its own affairs, only the one who eats the bitter herb knows the bitterness. Which family in the village isn't struggling to make ends meet? Taxes are high, supplies are plentiful, expenses are high, and there's a lot of work to be done. Previous leaders also had their own hardships. Take me, for example, there's no hair to be found on an egg, I'm completely broke. My wife has no food to eat, and yesterday I already sent her to the city to help others. This debt-collecting son has also been taken to the city by his sister to be raised. You think there are many benefits to being a leader, but as for me, alas, don't even mention it, I'll definitely be leaving Niutou Village sooner or later. Village head, village head, I've had a good reputation my whole life, but I haven't gotten to eat mutton, and my mouth is full of the smell of sheep! I can't do this kind of bird business! It's really not something a human can do!"</p>
<p>"Alright! Alright!" Mr. Da Sheng found an opportunity to push him. "A Wen is the village head, only A Wen's name is known above. If your daughter leaves, who will the superiors look for in Niutou Village? I was originally helping A Wen. Fine, A Wen, you go! It'll save me the trouble too."</p>
<p>"Then there really will be a rebellion!" A Xian stood up from the bed. "As the saying goes, a snake cannot move without a head, if there is no leader, what will become of us!"</p>
<p>As A Xian spoke, he edged past the table and stood by the door. A burst of shouting came from outside.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? What's wrong? Who's hitting someone!" A Xian couldn't help but shout out.</p>
<p>A De and Kai Yang both squeezed towards the door.</p>
<p>In the distance, they saw Dong Sheng limping towards them.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Am I a scapegoat! Am I a scapegoat!" Duo Sheng limped along, cursing, as he walked over. "Is Mr. Feng Wen here? I'm not doing this bird village police job anymore! I'm not doing this bird village police job anymore! I want the village head to give me justice! I want the village head to give me justice!"</p>
<p>As he got closer and closer, they gradually saw the bloodstains on his head!</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Mr. Da Sheng and Mr. Feng Wen both put down their chopsticks and stood up! Only old Mu Ren was still lying on his buttocks, drinking his wine.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Hmph!" Duo Sheng limped into the house, spread his legs and stood still, saying, "Shou Fu Da Pao hit someone, Shou Fu Da Pao actually hit me like that! Shou Fu Da Pao actually hit me like that."</p>
<p>Kai Yang's mother, who was cooking the fire, also turned out from the inner room.</p>
<p>"Amitabha! What happened?"</p>
<p>Correction: In the article "What to Celebrate Double Tenth Day" published in the previous Japanese newspaper, the word Tistas should be removed after Democratic in the second line; also, the two words "bing fei" in the seventeenth line should be "bing qie"; also, in the nineteenth line, as in a sentence from the British political commentary Burke, the word "jia" should be removed after the two words "political commentary", we hereby correct, and hope readers pay attention.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Over 660,000 Imported Games and Toys <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>This year's promotion of "National Goods" was originally intended for both women and children, meaning that "mothers and children" could easily join together in patriotic actions. The result of the rallying cries is that perfumes and powders worth many tens of thousands were imported, and precious decorations and lace also amounted to many tens of thousands. This naturally makes people sigh that as the national crisis intensifies, "modernity" flourishes even more, echoing the lament that when a nation is about to perish, there will inevitably be monstrous things. However, the accompanying "children's national goods" have not won back many hearts either. According to reports, by mid-August of this year, imports of games and toys have reached a huge sum of over 660,000 national currency. Children, under the "earnest instructions" of adults, are not as addicted to luxury and dissipation as "modern" women, but they still cannot fulfill much of their patriotic responsibility. It really makes us wonder whether to grab these "ignorant children" and spank them, or blame whom?</p>
<p>Although these trivial ornaments are related to the great cause of the country and the nation, we have never blamed all the evils on women, and naturally we have no reason to blame it on children now. All consumption of luxury goods has become a symptom of the current social pathology. That is to say, the more bankrupt China's economy becomes, the more the desire for pleasure among a portion of the people increases, and the result must be the influx of "imported goods" to cater to this demand. It is not all Chinese women who use Parisian perfumes and powders, and it is not all children who can play with "foreign dolls" and all kinds of new-style games and toys. This is undoubtedly obvious.</p>
<p>Economic bankruptcy has greatly reduced China's market, and under the increasingly desolate situation, friends with full pockets are also entertaining themselves with the pleasures of sensual entertainment. Therefore, foreigners who are good at "Zigon's art" come to find their patrons in this area. The very crude national goods movement naturally cannot satisfy the desires of this group of people with high material enjoyment. Since women who pride themselves on being modern are already like this, how can they have the ability to call on these obedient and ignorant children!</p>
<h3 id="e210">Setting Up a Ring <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>The one who sets up a ring is a hero, and the one who fights in the ring is of course also a hero. Setting up a ring and fighting in a ring were common things to hear about in the past. Even several years ago, there were Ma Yongzhen and Huo Yuanjia who came to the foreign concessions of Shanghai to set up rings. But unfortunately, both of these heroes were ultimately ambushed and killed by the hands of non-heroes, which is truly a pity!</p>
<p>But the ring of today is indeed invisible to the eyes and inaudible to the ears. This is because there are too many "weak scholars" and "ailing beauties" in our country; and most of the martial arts enthusiasts are self-appreciatingly refined, and even if they have learned a few fancy boxing techniques, they are still not qualified to set up a ring. Moreover, in today's era of flourishing science, there is simply no ring to set up. Even if there is, it can only be said to be a game. If you really want to defeat all the invincible opponents in the world, then claiming to be a hero and a hegemon is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Anyone who sets up a ring must at least have confidence that he is extraordinary, and at the same time have considered that few people are his opponents. Even if he cannot have the expectation of having two opponents retreat at the same time, he thinks that he will not be thrown off the stage by the one who fights in the ring. Moreover, he stands firmly on the stage, and the one who goes to fight him must commit an act of insubordination. In terms of status, he always occupies some advantage; however, it is unexpected when he unfortunately encounters an opponent who throws him off the ring several feet high.</p>
<p>The one who sets up the ring thinks that his skills are greater than the sky, looking down on everything and despising everything; therefore, the words he speaks always carry a tone of arrogance. What "punching through the north and south two capitals," what "kicking across the two banks of the Yellow River," with imposing dignity, invincible in the world, it seems to be a bit of a menacing appearance. The one who fights in the ring also does so because: firstly, he is a little unconvinced after hearing his bragging, so he can't help but go to "try out my old man's skills," and secondly, he sees him flaunting his power and wants to strike him down, so that he can also show that he is a hero and curb his arrogance. But this also requires measuring your own strength, is it enough? If you go to do it recklessly like Kuafu chasing the sun, wouldn't that be terrible. So I say: setting up a ring is a very difficult thing, and fighting in the ring is even more difficult; this is definitely not something that everyone can set up, nor is it something that everyone can fight.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Zhang Xuebin of the Linji Orthodox Sect of the Shaolin Temple set up a "Plum Blossom Stake Ring" in the Great Shanghai Garden, calling for seeking teachers and visiting friends; according to him, he is not only capable of all eighteen kinds of martial arts, but also proficient in the so-called "Golden Bell Cover" and "Iron Shirt" kung fu, and is able to be invulnerable to knives and spears (?). This statement is really similar to the swordsmen described in martial arts novels. Of course, I am not an expert, and I cannot use scientific theories to prove whether he has it or not; but according to my guess, there is a bit of a lie in this.</p>
<h3 id="e211">About Raising Children for Young Couples <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Ying</p>
<p>Suppose in a completely unconstrained small family. The husband is very young and the wife is beautiful enough, of course, the intensity of love between the couple need not be said; the husband's exclusive love for the wife, and the wife's tender consideration for the husband, are also directly proportional!</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>However, the question is always what to do after there is a crystallization of love? Even if it does not hinder the husband, at least in the wife's responsibility, it is necessary to take care of herself and her husband, and also take care of the child.</p>
<p>In many cases, it often happens that after a wife has a child, she obviously shifts the weight from her husband to her child, concerning the child's clothes, food, and living. If the child is too cute, she will often unintentionally strip the husband of his entire love.</p>
<p>So this is extremely dangerous for couples! In the future, after the husband does not get the wife's entire exclusive love, he can easily vent on the child, from jealousy of the child to resentment! This seems like a very unnecessary thing!</p>
<p>However, conversely, if the couple wants to permanently maintain the solidity of their love, for the comfort of their own lives! Then, if the child lacks good care, or is completely left to others to ignore, then even more tragic events are more likely to happen!</p>
<p>A young mother with a child must have the dual responsibility of taking care of and loving the husband and the entire child. (Naturally, those with fixed occupations are still exceptions). She must extremely cherish everything about the child, but she must also take care of everything about the husband, so that the husband does not feel annoyed, abandoned, or even resented out of jealousy because of the child; in the same way, he can more smoothly obtain exclusive love and arouse the joy and fun of having a child!</p>
<p>Young mothers, what an easy but burdensome job it is!</p>
<h3 id="e212">"Its heart is also beating differently!" <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>

<h3 id="e213">Mexico's Melancholy <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Jun</p>
<p>For her melancholy, I also became melancholy::::</p>
<p>With two big eyes, a round black face, and always hanging the mark of melancholy on the brow is she—the other day when I asked her name, she told me the most beautiful Mexican flavor of Ramona.</p>
<p>(Ramona)!</p>
<p>Then I thought of this as a novel, which was later made into a movie, accompanied by a beautiful song of the name. So, my mouth reached her ear:</p>
<p>—Ramona! Do you know that you make me think of Mexico, the beaches there, the Rio Grande there, the bullfighting arena there? Your name is a song, three years ago I was hanging on the corner of my mouth all day long, singing in the coconut branches under the tropical palm trees. Now I have forgotten it; but for you, I should sing it again!</p>
<p>The next day, with a heart of passionate love. I was looking for "Ramona" in every sheet music sales place on North Sichuan Road: Appro Music Store, Japanese Music Store, Liangyou Company.</p>
<p>—"Ramona"? It's out of date!</p>
<p>—"Ramona"? You go to the opposite store to ask about it.</p>
<p>Is it really out of date? Ramona is so young, blooming like a morning sunflower. Unexpected good fortune in the last one I got this songbook; immediately looked a lot younger, walked out of the door jumping and laughing for no reason.</p>
<p>Quietly, without letting anyone know, I took the songbook and took advantage of the dead afternoon to hide in the flower bushes in the campus and sing; the voice was low, like a dream::::</p>
<p>(God, let my devout, pure, and full of loving voice be able to relieve her melancholy. It is unfortunate to paint a layer of gray powder on such a strong face: why be melancholy!)</p>
<p>—Why be melancholy? Because men are black-hearted; they don't let me be with people. This is such a despicable idea, I am really afraid of them:::</p>
<p>She told me, and suddenly leaned on my shoulder and cried.</p>
<p>Gently stroking her, comforting her with my most passionate words; kissing her neck, which was blackened by the water in the swimming pool and the summer sun. I remembered that beautiful song, and sang it lowly—":::Ramona, I need you my own."</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e214">News from the "Scholarly-Vocational Mutual Aid Advancement Association" <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>Following your publication of a letter about organizing the "Scholarly-Vocational Mutual Aid Advancement Association" in your esteemed newspaper, I have received letters from a total of forty-six comrades expressing their desire to join this organization. Consequently, we convened the first preparatory meeting last Sunday evening at 8 PM. Only twenty-three people attended. (The notification letters were sent out on Saturday, so perhaps some people had not yet received them, or were unable to attend due to work commitments.) Although only half of the people attended, everyone was very excited and enthusiastic. With the exception of a few people who remained quietly silent, most people actively offered their opinions, and the principles of the charter were discussed item by item. We adjourned hurriedly around 10 PM, after hastily electing nine preparatory committee members due to time constraints.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the few preparatory committee members and I discussed it again. However, due to a lack of organizational experience, one problem is difficult to solve. That is, the basic fund is contributed by each member according to their ability. At the first preparatory meeting, more than fifty yuan had already been donated. The monthly membership fee has not yet been decided, but it will probably be between four and six jiao. The funds seem too small, so we urgently need to solicit more members. However, if we formally establish the association now and then solicit members, although it would be better in terms of form and organization, we would have no way to raise funds for the initial equipment, such as desks, chairs, and all necessary items. Moreover, the monthly rent would be a heavy burden. If we don't establish a headquarters and instead borrow a member's place as a mailing address, it seems too disorganized. Members would not have a good impression, and it would be difficult for members to gather for academic research. If we temporarily don't announce the establishment and first solicit members to increase the fund income, then the process will definitely be delayed. Older members who joined earlier, seeing that the progress of the association is quite slow, will inevitably become gradually indifferent (although there are a few who are still enthusiastically looking forward to it, they are, after all, a minority). Please, sir, think of a proper solution for us, and instruct us on how to proceed.</p>
<p>Also, is it necessary for the organization of a group to register with the municipal government? What are the registration procedures? Should we register after establishment or before establishment? If we don't have a headquarters, can we register? We also hope that you will answer in detail. Furthermore, we hope that you will publish this letter so that members who did not attend the first preparatory meeting can get a general idea, and that like-minded vocational comrades can enthusiastically join this organization. My mailing address is: Liu Feng Editorial Department, No. 14, Lane 360, Beijing Road. Wishing you peace in your writing.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Huang Xu</p>
<p>October 4th</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Editor's Note: It is commendable that Mr. Huang and others were able to organize this group in such a short period of time, and their enthusiasm and perseverance are admirable. Now, you can formally establish it first. Regarding the headquarters, if you don't have a suitable place for the time being, you can discuss it with organizations such as the YMCA, the Municipal Higher Education Association, and the China Vocational Education Society, and temporarily borrow their places to hold meetings. In addition, you can also hold them in various parks. In the initial stage, it is not necessary to rent your own headquarters, and in fact, you do not have the ability to do so. As for regular contact, it can be handled by members with better circumstances and higher positions, using their offices or residences as temporary communication centers.</p>
<p>The fact that more than fifty yuan has already been donated to the fund shows everyone's enthusiasm for founding the group. However, the editor hopes that this deposit will be reserved for future regular and incidental expenses. Desks, chairs, and other items can be temporarily handled with each person's existing equipment, and there is no need to strive for comfort. Renting another house does not seem necessary at present. When starting an organization, only seek a solid foundation, and all expenses should be kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>All organizations should register with the authorities when they are established. You can inquire about the procedures from the Municipal Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>Introducing a new book: "Dead Ashes," a collection of poems by Yan Chonglou, has been published recently. The text is vivid and the illustrations are exquisite. It is now published by the Life Bookstore. If you enclose four jiao in postage stamps and send them to the Literary Society at No. 63 Pushi Road, this port, the author will send you a personally signed copy of the book.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter: Autumn Feelings</p>
<p>A gust of autumn wind blows. Light clouds and thin dew suddenly part. The clear sky reveals a round moon. A piece of pure light shines into the inner chamber. Lonely in the inner chamber, without a companion. Raising her head, she fears seeing the moon's light. The round moon shines on the shadow of separation. Sent to the long pavilion, not returning for a long time. Waiting until the end of the world, without news (In the mirror, the old form is no longer there. In dreams, they meet night after night. Not as good as expressing it once during separation. Thinking about it, tears hide in the cheeks. The man gave the woman a fragrant silk handkerchief to wipe them with. There are many affectionate women in the world. They also love the family's exquisite talent. Applying powder, beside the dressing table. Tender village, young men are easily swayed. How can there be any sour intention in my life. Endure my diligence, endure me doubly. What harm is there in calling each other sisters when we meet. Draw them together in one stroke, two people's eyebrows. Only worried about reading and occupying the good spring light. Preventing the journey, not allowing them to come. The belt is gradually widening, and the person is getting thinner. Knowing the secret feelings, the waist circumference. Intricate hairpins will buy a boat. Low discount to find the edge of the world. Thin body wants no compensation.</p>

<p>This day? The sky had just turned a faint fish-belly color from the dimness, and Fan Jiashu hurriedly climbed out of bed, quietly walked out the door, and explained to Liu Fu that he was going to the park to breathe some fresh air. Liu Fu, because he was sick, of course had no doubt! After Jiashu arrived at Xiantan, what was the first feeling he got? The stone bench on the southeast side of the ancient hall was exactly where he and Fengxi had made their pledge of love that morning. The past is in sight, but I never thought that now, the mulberry field has turned into a blue sea! While he was recalling the past, suddenly there was a sound of panting behind him, and a person came out?</p>
