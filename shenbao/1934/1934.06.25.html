<p>時評</p>
<h3>日俄關係之波動恒</h3>
<p>自九一八以來。日俄戰爭之說。不絕於耳。然情態一張一弛。迄今猶未爆發。最耐人尋味者。卽日本對俄之態度。近已逐漸軟化。不如往昔之强硬。方日人逮捕中東路蘇俄職員之時。氣燄萬丈。有非蘇俄立卽表示屈伏不可之勢。迨至美俄復交。情勢驟變。日方乘機轉舵。釋放被捕蘇俄人員。至於最近。蘇俄扣留日本漁艇事件。砲擊在俄邊攝影之日船事件。日本皆以不了了之。並未提出强有力之抗議。反之。在蘇俄方面。態度轉趨强硬。莫斯科負責要人之排日宣傳。屢見報章。中東路之賣買問題。不肯任便。此外對於日僞雙方之一切糾紛。悉以毫不苟且之態度出之。其凖備與日周旋之意。固灼然可見也。倘日人果欲對俄作戰者。則在此狀態之下。隨處皆可藉口。何以反至裝痴作聾。故示鎭静乎。吾人略加推敲。卽知日人態度之變換。自有其深意在焉。</p>
<p>最顯然者。卽蘇俄在遠東之防禦力量。已强固異常而其與資本國家之外交關係。亦遠勝於前。最近西比利亞鐵路之雙軌。敷設完竢。西來移民，復倍增於昔。加以蘇俄二屆五年計劃。又節節告成。國力增强自不待言。於此之時。日本若貿然對俄開戰。勝算之操。恐日人亦不敢自信。</p>
<p>再者。二次日俄之戰。當决勝於空軍。蘇俄空軍現有飛機三千架。日本尙非其比。苟一旦作戰。日本之都市。皆在蘇俄飛機航程範圍以內。而其國內之民。房又多爲易於燃燒之紙木等物所造成。日俄戰爭一起。俄機蜂踴而至。日本都市。卽有首被炸毁之虞。故日本非擴大空軍力至於無所恐懼地位。必難操戰事之勝算。因是對俄不敢貿然開戰。近據東京電訊日本已决定擴充飛機製造廠。凖備大舉擴充空軍。可見日本政府深知空軍之不敵蘇俄也。　由是推斷。日本對俄態度之軟化，並不足以證明日俄關係之好轉。但日人素稱慧　。苟非歐西局面發生激變。及本身力量有恃無恐之後。則必不致魯莾攻俄。反是蘇俄方面。若認爲戰爭之時機已至而必欲一發者。則日本亦必卽起應戰。故今後日俄二次大戰之樞機。當視蘇俄挑撥之程度何如耳。</p>

<h3>日本最近之經濟現狀（日本通信）農村經濟衰落蠶絲工業頽廢</h3>
<p>日本工業基礎、不在重工業而在纎維工業、在纎維工業中、尤以蠶絲爲最重要在生絲業鼎盛時代之一九二五年、生絲輸出最高達八萬七千九百萬元日金、其輸出塲所、百分之九十在美國、但自一九二九年、受經濟恐慌風潮激盪、卽以美國爲最烈、美國一般人民之額外消耗、尤其是對絲織品一類、消耗頓形减低、然一九二九年、日本之生絲輸出、尙占其貿易輸出總額三分之一、爲數計七萬萬元日金、其後市况日下、美國一般消耗愈少、絲業生產亦同樣减少、且人造絲織品、日漸進步、故至一九三○年、日本生絲輸出、遂低至四萬一千九百萬日金左右、而最近三年間輸出、竟跌至三萬萬元上下、斯業之衰落、僅以此區區數字計、已可窺見其一般、</p>
<p>生絲市塲價格跌落、原爲日本經濟問題之癌腫、自去年以來、絲價尙能以日金匯價便宜之故、而維持其有利之買賣、今年入春以來、美金實行貶價結果、日金在匯兌上之利便、漸次失去、日絲銷美、卽因此受巨大打擊、六月春繭上市後、絲價竟跌破五百元大關、繭價每貫（七斤半）平均約二元五·六十錢、如此情形、養蠶家須折本一元上下、</p>
<p>茲舉著名各縣屬情形、以爲證例、静岡縣·蠶繭每貫生產費、桑葉費一元三十六錢、蠶種費二十錢四釐、勞動工資一元四十錢、養蠶工具費十一錢四釐、補溫費十錢七釐、各種稅欵九錢、雜費十三錢五釐、蠶室費十三錢一釐、總計生產費須三元五十四錢一釐、而今年春繭市價、該縣平均不過二元七十錢、於是養蠶之家、每貫春繭、須虧折八十四錢一釐、以養蠶爲主之山地農村、因而疲　愈甚、此種情�</p>
<p>形、就整體觀察、固屬樂觀者少而悲觀者多也、</p>
<p>長野縣·亦爲日本出產生絲主要縣分之一、年來受恐慌影響、已困頓不堪、民間生活之難、幾至不敷溫飽、去年春夏秋三季、繭價每貫收入、約爲五元二十錢時、其支出方面、如肥料·農具·之騰貴等、以中級農家收支相較、猶虧欠三四十元、今年繭價竟跌至二元五十錢左右、其一般農村經濟、寗不陷於破產狀態乎、</p>
<p>茨城縣·亦以蠶桑稱著、去年春繭、平均市價爲六元十六錢、今年龍崎市塲所開價格、不過二元三十八錢、與一九三二年最低價格二元四十七錢相較、猶低九錢、此實爲繭價市塲之空前跌落、</p>
<p>以此類價格、平均計算、收入蠶繭一百九十五萬貫、繭價收入總計、應爲四百六十四萬一千元、與去年二百萬貫之繭收六元十六錢之市價相較、則將减少至於七百六十七萬九千元之多、換言之、卽養蠶家每户減少收入一百零九元七十錢、此種打擊、卒置全縣農家於極端窮窘之下卽使出賣子女、亦不足以繳納租稅、故該縣地方稅之遲繳數量、已超過一百萬元、甚至農會會費、亦無錢繳付、肥料商店、竟相繼倒閉、社會各層、均因此同陷於苦境、</p>
<p>其餘如千葉·山梨·及其他凡養蠶植桑之縣分、雖輕重各有些微差别、其爲全面的恐慌、則初無二致、今後日本製絲廠、或將乘繭價低落之際、盡量收買、以圖將來之高利、惟現時美國絲市、非特無上漲氣象、且有下跌趨勢、日絲廠旣曾受相當損失、創痕迄今未復、又詎能放手收受、是則縱有政府補助、亦恐不易維持、全日本二百三十萬之蠶桑農家、三十五萬以上農家出身之絲廠工女、均發生當前之生活威脅、由此而影響及於日本經濟界全體、恐較一九三二年爲尤酷也、（六月十七日於東京）</p>

<h3>暹羅華僑社會之動向</h3>
<p>景况日下工潮日趨激烈　　禁辦華校僑胞處境日難</p>
<p>盤谷通訊、近數年來的暹羅華僑社會、已經動盪得和從前大不相同、尤其是今年以來、眞可謂多事之秋、最近又發生兩件大事、可證暹羅華僑社會之動向及其動搖、所謂兩大案、（一）鐵路工人之罷工（二）華校十數家被封、暹敎部創辦華文專校、國營鐵路工人罷工後、繼而火礱工人亦罷工、工潮已瀰漫全暹、在罷工風潮、可以看出左列各種現象、（一）工人已日漸覺悟、（二）暹羅社會經濟恐慌、已日趨嚴重（三）勞資對立愈趨尖銳化、（四）工人之生活痛苦、遂使工人積極反抗、</p>
<p>至於查封華校、近日已閣得滿城風雨、自崇實學校被强迫關門以後、更引起華僑社會嚴重的注意和不安、其結果最値注意者、爲左列各欵、（一）私立華校將逐日减少、而官立華文專校將日見增多、（二）華僑子弟不能多讀中國文、而要多讀暹文、（三）暹文敎員將日見增多、而華文敎員將日見減少、（四）懂暹文之一知半解之華文敎員將日見增加、而不懂暹文之優良華文敎員將日見减少、（五）華僑子弟將漸忘其祖國、</p>

<p>查去年該會之產生、係因一二西人、對於現行人力車之不滿、向工部局故甚其詞、請求組織而成、委員人選、有麥西·朱懋澄·等五人、從事調查、關於車商澈底之陳述、槪置不理、僅據不盡不實之言詞、認爲凖確、貿然建議、改革十六條、開始三項、卽用不合理之主張、擬將原有執照一萬張、內由明年一月一日起、每年收回二千張、另給毫無關係之人、組織一新公司辦理、嗣經董事會議予以擱置、餘十三條均屬危詞聳聽、得以朦蔽通過、至本年五月、改設人力車務委員會、所有人選仍係麥西·朱懋澄·等一切設施、均屬不可能之事項、試爲縷晰言之</p>
<h3>改良車樣</h3>
<p>關於改良車樣不合之點、(一)　　該會於事前並不與閶、突於五月二十九日、發出通告、責令各車商如有破舊之車、自卽日起、須更換標凖式樣、否則不給執照、作迅雷不及掩耳之計、(二)各車商貢獻合乎公用之改良車樣、槪不採納、竟欲將現行及預備車輛、完全廢棄、另製最浮華最不經濟之類似包車式樣、以爲標凖、而報告猶以務使經濟輕便、耐用舒適爲言、諸多矛盾、查現行之車、從無不輕便舒適之可言、况旣需耐用、勢必物質堅固而後、可乃言行不符其爲、囫圇粉飾、已可槪見、</p>
<h3>減低車租&lt;關於减低車租不合之點、(一)</h3>
<p>車輛除成本外、所有經常維持費與騐捐修理、或意外事故、平均每月須停業五日、加以承放人之酬勞金、及收入小洋支出大洋之折耗等等、每月餘利不滿三元、本年三月、已由公會將營業表格、具呈工部局在案、乃該會不加詳察、報告中竟有車夫每日勞働所得、盡爲車主勒索以去二語、聳人聽聞、　車主於不義、其抹煞事實、莫此爲甚、（二）查各項勞工、均係規定之工資、惟人力車夫所得車資、除繳租外、悉屬自有、其收入多寡、以勤惰而判、生活狀况、亦因此而分、况特區車夫、不下四萬人、該會報告中、據調查車夫五十家之所得、平均斷定、一律生活若何之苦、而於車主方面、毫不顧及、實未盡調查之能事、竟規定每日車租至本年八月减爲小洋十角、明年一月减爲小洋八角、直使車商業務、不能維持、斷絕生計而後已、猶曰、逐漸减租、純爲體恤車商起見、其誰信之、</p>
<h3>救濟車夫至救濟車夫、本會已先彙集五萬元、委托滬上名流、設計</h3>
<p>辦理、於必要時、再行籌補、該會復責令各車主、每日每輛、向車夫征收救濟費小洋一角、組織車夫互助會、無論取自本身、以資救濟、是否適當倘車夫不予征收、勢必仍由車主墊出、况前報告、有救濟費統由車務委會辦理、茲報告諱言其事、混曰由工部局派監察三人、再請慈善團體代表會議進行、其掩飾耳目、無非以救濟會之美名、藉固該車務委會之位置、其作用當可想見、</p>
<h3>發給執照</h3>
<p>又報告發給車夫執照、係提　高人格、以免虐待情事、驟聆</p>
<p>之似大仁大義、但不知車夫往來無定、一經歸里務農、無執照者不得拉車、勢必使車輛類多停擱、他如規定車資、一乘車小洋一角、一英里二角一小時六角、直使乘客盡向電車公共汽車乘載、非特不能提高車夫生活、反致車夫於絕境、乃報告而言、並不强制實行、又曰、惟規定標凖、不使車夫與乘客有爭價之麻煩、此種語氣、翻來覆去、殊不可解、現已號召車主領證、否則不給執照其爲逼迫車主履行上列各項苛條、顯而易見、總之、種種計劃、均屬不可能之事項、又爲最不善之設施、而鰓鰓然稱爲求各方面之改善、附會其事、粉飾其詞、以朦蔽市民之視聽、事實俱在、果將誰欺、茲車商値此强制政策危急存亡之際、情急聲嘶、異常憤慨、不得不將該會計劃之報告、逐項辯駁、鄭重以申明之、乞求各機關各法團各同業及社會各人士、主持公道、作嚴正之批評、俾車業不至受重大之損害、瀕於破產、實爲萬幸云云、</p>
<h3>新順天輪昨日照常駛靑烟津旅客購票均須具有舖保</h3>
<p>太古輪船公司新順天輪、爲海盜騎刦脫險抵滬後、昨日上午十二時、照常由滬駛靑島·威海衛·烟台·天津·惟對於旅客均須舖保、否則拒絕購票、</p>
<h3>交部令航政局切實檢定船員以謀航行安全</h3>
<p>上海航政局及航業公會、奉交通部訓令云、查未滿五十總噸輪船檢定暫行章程、經於四月九日公佈、并通飭施行在案、該章程第十四條規定未領證書之船員、應於本章、公佈日起、六個月內聲請檢定、現距公佈日期已逾兩月、仍未見小輪船舊員聲請檢定、所餘四個月限期、轉瞬卽逝、屆時未領有證書者、應卽停止在船服務、爲此再予通令、仰卽一體遵照、依限聲請檢定、幸勿觀望自誤、切切、此令、</p>

<h3>市衛生局創辦傳染病院成效收容病人以白喉爲多　　死亡率約百分之十六　　　！！俟新屋落成後再謀擴充！！</h3>
<p>本市衛生局、鑒於市政府行政區內、尙乏完善之傳染病醫院、實爲市政建設上之缺點、乃於市　萬分困難中籌劃的欵、商得閘北中國公立醫院之同意、改辦市立傳染病醫院、茲將創辦經過現在狀况分誌於下、</p>
<h3>創辦經過</h3>
<p>市衛生局因傳染病醫院之不容一刻或緩、爰卽商得閘北中國</p>
<p>公立醫院當局同意、於一二八滬戰被燬後之空地、建築新屋、旋卽委定該局第二科科長吳利國爲院長、並聘定陸建辛等三人爲住院醫師、隨寳華等十餘人爲看護、並於本年三月十日、就原有房屋、先行收治病人、內容設備、較前擴充、取費</p>
<p>低廉、赤貧者且可全免、</p>
<h3>收容病人　計該院自開診以來</h3>
<p>凡三閱月、就診者殊爲擁擠、其中尤以四月份爲最、住院病人、截至五月底止、凡二百二十七人、內以患白喉者爲最多、猩紅熱次之、天花又次之、腦膜炎較少、</p>
<h3>至亡原因</h3>
<p>至本院死亡率約占百分之十六、推其死因大都係由投治過遲、蓋初病時未卽就醫、旣知爲傳染病矣、則</p>
<h3>汽油售價步漲實部擬謀開發油礦</h3>
<p>計劃已呈行政院審核</p>
<p>我國煤油市塲、自被英·美·俄·三國火油公司積極競銷以來、貿易情形、卽入混沌狀態、各公司年損綦鉅、嗣後曾洽議聯絡、油價遂逐步回漲、我國川省油礦、蘊藏極富、實業部有鑒於此、擬卽　法開採、以資抵制、茲將最近汽油價格激增情形誌下、</p>
<h3>售價步高尙無止境</h3>
<p>據本市煤油界消息　在華之德士古·美孚·油遍地·亞細亞</p>
<p>火油公司、爲挽回前虧起見、除將煤油售價、於本月十九日再度將每十加倫之售價、高漲至七元七角外、昨日又將汽油售價、每十加倫漲至八元一角、較前價計漲一角、於可能範圍內、尙擬繼續提高、</p>
<h3>實部注意開發油礦</h3>
<p>又據實業界消息、實部近對外商火油公司競銷、過剩火油事頗</p>
<p>爲注意、現爲謀自給起見、擬將川省之富順縣·榮縣·兩石油礦、劃爲國營礦區、業將各項開掘計劃、呈報行政院備案、一俟批准、卽擬聘請採礦人才、從事開始發掘猶狐疑不决、視入傳染病醫院爲畏途、及其病已危重、始思就醫、然已無及、據該院負責者言、該院時有全家老幼均患傳染病而住院治療、詢其何以致此、則謂初起時、以爲無足輕重、迨全家被染、已無法可想、殆市民缺乏醫藥常識、及敎育程度幼稚之故、</p>
<h3>現謀擴充</h3>
<p>該院所收治之病人、僅市民患傳染病中之一小部份、其他不治而死亡、或因之而疾病散播者、尙不知凡幾、該院以目下房屋不敷、故暫祗收治白喉·猩紅熱·天花·流行性腦脊髓膜炎·斑疹·傷寒·鼠疫·及霍亂·等七種傳染病、一俟新屋落成後、再謀擴充收治疫病範圍、</p>

<p>上塲德孚邱飛海、因未臻於佳美合作之境、最初之形勢、全非卡潘之敵手、在卡潘猛力壓迫之下、連失五局、一籌莫展、雖力戰挽回三局、潘卡以六比三勝第一盤、第二盤邱德之間、已見純熟、於是依樣葫蘆、施以報復亦以四比一、居極對優勢、五比三而以六比三奪回第二盤、一來一往、形勢尙見均也、</p>
<h3>突趨緊張</h3>
<p>第二盤爲重要之轉變、爲勝負之關鍵、形勢亦趨於緊張、卡潘兩人、再度稱雄、以三比一而五比一、似握必勝之權、在此極驚險之形勢中、邱德兩人、突然振起、連下三局、打成五比五、在艱困之局面中、發現一綫曙光、卡潘雖再以六比五居前、邱德又得三局、以八比六再勝第三盤而以一比一估先矣、</p>
<h3>德孚稱雄</h3>
<p>休息之後、作第四盤之最决賽、邱德復以六比四得勝、遂以三比一解决、德孚在第三盤中、手擎天、打開局面、而第四盤之得勝、德孚之功、復居十七、身高臂長、隨處攔殺、其殺球之穏、尤爲克敵之所在、輔以穏健之邱飛海、潘卡遂無生路、競爭成四比三、德孚勝發球局、潘發球亦勝成五比四、邱最後再勝發球、終以六比四定勝負、</p>
<p>中國網球會表演賽許承基勝小鄭　此數爲兩個六比二雙打許梁擊敗余王</p>
<p>中國網球會昨日舉行第四次表演比賽、單打爲鄭兆佳對許承基、事前以爲可有一番劇戰、但事實上鄭兆佳之表演、遜於往日、許以六比二及六比二連勝、雙打許承基梁德光以二比一盤勝王文正余田光、此數二比六、六比三、九比七、</p>
<h3>許承基勝鄭兆佳　二人表演單調</h3>
<p>頗少興趣、良以鄭兆佳態度慌張、失誤迭出、許承基連得四局、並未費力、僅第二局上有激烈之競爭、此數成平手者多次、後鄭連得兩局後、以二比六失敗、第二盤鄭仍不振作、許勝首局、鄭以滑四得第二局、後許連日四局、卒以六比二再勝、</p>
<h3>雙打許梁勝余王　　單打旣畢　暫停</h3>
<p>約一刻鐘、王文正余田光上海網球會表演後趕到、與許承梁德光作雙打賽、雙方均爲疲憊</p>
<p>之軍、精神不振、梁德光依然故我、頗少進境、首盤余王組以六比二勝、次盤許承基之高壓、大顯身手、博得掌聲不少、以六比三勝、第三盤王余先勝三局、頗佔優勢、但許梁不甘示弱、亦獲三局、王余又勝兩局、成五比三、以爲不難完成是盤、但許梁竟又連加三加、反以六比五勝、雙方在緊要關頭、極力掙扎、許梁又失二局後、卒再得三局、以九比十得最勝利、誠極變化不測之比賽、</p>

<h3>兩江女體師</h3>

<p>感、到會賓衆、有市敎育局長潘公展氏、婦女節制會會長鄭維夫人、女律師林克聰、儉德銀行行長歐建成、立興洋行買辦陳秉剛、華威公司經理卞毓英、及校董、敎職員、校友、學生家屬約五百餘人、畢業生李傅愛等四十五人、衣白紡綢旗袍各執鮮花一束、魚貫入禮堂、氣象嚴肅輝煌行禮如儀、由潘局長給憑、給奬、並致訓詞、亘一小時之久、潘氏詞旨大意有三、（一）女子體育與健全民族之重要、中央政府、地方政府、所設體育學校、幾寥若晨星、潘氏於私人經營之體育學校、謂當盡指導匡救責任、極避求全責備、吹毛求疵之弊、（二）對該校　二八後之努力復興、對陸校長之艱辛奮鬥、頗表贊美與慰逸、（三）對畢業生訓話、應注意中小學校學生、基本體格之鍜鍊、以健强民族爲鵠的、非徒爲解决個人職業而已、陸校長、鄭維夫人、林克聰女士、均有切重肯綮之　詞、用不多贅、遊藝如丹麥梯形舞、歡樂凖備舞、不尙舞衣之華麗、動作之婀娜、蓋純爲硬性之健美舞姿、洵屬生面别開、難能可貴、話劇計三齣、愛、（三）芝蘭與仲卿、「南歸」、演員支配恰合身分、其滑稽突梯處、令人忍俊不禁、散會時、已夕暉西沈矣、</p>

<h3>兩年來之中央大學（二）（續）羅家倫</h3>
<p>七·集中行政機關俾增辦公效率以前行政各處組辦公地點、極爲星散、接洽不便、監督難周茲將大禮堂兩翼、重加間隔、妥爲佈置、將學校行政機關、悉數遷入、時間旣能節省、效率自可增加、</p>
<p>八·改革會計制度學校經濟之監督考核端賴會計制度、本校積習相因、會計漫無成法、流弊所及、甚至人人可以代賣公物、代買公物、而無從加以限制、爰聘請會計師三人、妥立會計制度、於二十一年秋頒布施行、其時尙在政府制定會計條例以前、務使一切賬目、條分縷析、隨時可查、隨時可繳、並確定庶務手續、公開標凖物價、留存物品樣件、以便隨時稽核</p>
<p>九·維持發薪定期力求敎職員生活安定兩學年來、幸蒙政府維護、敎育經費得無虧欠、然遇熱河閩變諸危難時期、本校亦屢呈捉襟見肘之現象、但無論如何、均曾維持規定發薪時期、不肯移後一日、以維持敎職員生活之安定、</p>
<p>十·整理債務本校舊債、拖積甚深、有遠在東南大學時代者、在此期間、力事整理、並組織委員會、覆核證件、計先後歸還、不下六萬餘元至無力淸理者、祇得從緩、惟本任內、一切購置採取先有凖備而後定購之政策、故從無拖欠情事、國外信用、已漸恢復、</p>
<p>十一·設置奬學金額爲鼓勵學生學業及救濟貧寒學生起見、每學期設置奬學金額約七十名計每學年一百四十名、分院奬學金及系奬學金兩種、計院奬學金每名每學期七十元、系奬學金每名每學期五十元、由敎援組織委員會、公開評核、奬勵成績優良學生、</p>
<p>十二·提高入學標凖注意學校試騐大學敎育本應重質而不重量、且必須如此、方能提高程度、發展學術、故二十二年度入學試騐、延聘敎授担任考試委員、認眞辦理、杜絕一切請託奬端、計考取人數與投考人數、爲一與十二之比其程度自趨整齊、至於在校各項試騐、除畢業考試、遵部令另行組織委員會、延聘校內外學者會同主持外、其餘各項考騐、須由敎授認眞辦理、一般學風、已經丕變</p>
<p>十三·提倡研究鼓勵學術刋物、凡敎授之有志趣從事專門研究者、苟屬力所能及、莫不勉爲設備、並欲得其研究結果、爲之刋布、以謀國際學術界、對於本校之重視、兩學年來計開始發行叢刋四種、又學術研究報告約十種、此雖係初步之效果、但將來必有繼續發揚光大之一日也、</p>
<p>十四·力謀與藝術機關合作並與國家及社會事業打成一片、兩學年來、凡國家及社會應興事業、本校力能恊助者、莫不惟力是視、如代導淮委員會分析淮河流域壤、恊助參謀機關調查四川石油、爲首都要塞造林數十萬株、派員至雲南邊界調查生物、爲江寗自治實騐縣調查全縣地質、改良蠶種、代其製種二萬張、並恊同其辦理實騐鄉農業改良事業、與全國經濟委員會會辦植　訓練班、爲中華文化敎育基金董事會辦理調查中學英文敎材問題等事業、均係歷歷可數者、且校內敎育實騐所、及經濟資料室行政研究資料室等之設置、均係訓練學生、爲研究當今實際問題之凖備、以求國立大學敎育、對於國計民生、稍有裨益、</p>
<p>凡此所舉、僅及大端、其餘不完不備之處仍多、尙待諸方面之指導與恊助、惟家倫有不能已於言者、卽本校是否能成爲國家完善之學府、當視新校址是否能建築遷移而定、敎育爲國家百年大計、吾人自不能囿於目前情况、需霑自喜、茲略陳校舍不能不遷之理由如下、（一）現在校址、逼中央大學加建後之書館</p>
<p>處都市中心、無從發展、如工學院欲增設工廠農學院欲加闢實騐田畝、均無可容（二）雜處市井、不宜養成高尙純樸之特殊學風、（三）農學院與校本部、尤其是與理學院分處、敎學設備、均不經濟、（四）敎授住所與學生住所問題、均不能滿意解决、旣分敎學者之心、復不能使敎授學生、常相接近、收問難質疑之充分效果、此亦就其著者而言、若詳確利害、尤多足述、事實上之需要今已迫不及待、故遷校主張、决非好大喜功之意見、二三年後、學術界當有更明顯之認識、深望賢明政府、及各方面愛護本校之人士、努力促成、</p>
<p>家之幸、亦學術之幸也、（二十三年六月十六日）</p>

<p>菜旣有百碗之多，煮炒的工夫當然是極繁複的了！現在我們只講車上的情形；在那四輛充作臨時御膳房的車輛之中，有一輛才是眞正的善房。在這一輛車上，靠壁的左右兩邊，分裝着五十座爐灶：這些爐灶：這些爐灶都是用白色的黏土塗着磚塊砌就的，架子是用生鐵做的，下面還有一個鐵盤，這兩件鐵器上，也一律有白漆塗着，所以不但可以沒有起火之患，便是在外觀方面，也覺得很潔淨齊整。在每一座爐灶上，每餐必被指定要做兩樣菜。讀者也許要問：爲什麽不讓實多擔任幾樣，也好减省幾座爐灶呢？這中間也有一層緣故，因爲有許多的菜，不是臨時就可以做起來的，必須費好多的時候去凖備。譬如像燜蒸鴨子，就得有兩天的文火去煮，才能酥爛。</p>
<p>當太后用膳的時候，必先有人去通知那幾個司機和司閘夫，吩咐他們把車子停下來；不過這些菜却不能待車子停了再做，好在我們這列火車自始至終、從不曾行駛得怎樣快過，那些廚子儘可在車行時把菜餚端正下。</p>
<p>每一座爐灶上，有一名廚子承値着。這些廚子是所謂「上手。」都得有相當的資格，才巴得上做「上手。」可是他們的工作，正是簡單而省力極了。每個人每餐只須做兩種菜，此外便别無差使。不過我總疑惑，他們各個人所擔任的兩種菜，是否確是他們自已的得意傑作？卽使是的話，他們的技術是否已經登峯造極，還是疑問。（六六）</p>
<h3>上海之留影</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>上海是一個五方雜處，的地方，你！儻若去留心，細細的觀察起來，實在有不少可驚可怪的事情，爲一般作家所未曾說過的！所以我把他寫在下面，給大家當作笑話罷。</p>
<p>前天到静安寺路</p>
<p>看見一座高大的洋房，那樓上玻璃窗下牆壁，偏露出點點的釘頭，風魚臘肉，都掛得錯雜可觀：那旁邊的晒臺上，還有幾柄破傘，和幾雙皮釘靴，也堆積着一塊兒鐵闌干外，小孩的尿布，同尖頭的襪套，隨那一條一條的脚布，正在風中飄揚着。這不是在上海像那所房屋裏，意外看見的麽？</p>
<p>還有一天，我在傍晚的時候，在一條弄堂裏出來，忽遇着有幾個狠摩登式小姐們，不曉得他嘴裏唸着什麽話，旁邊還有傭婦小婢，執着香燭錠帛，和幾碗似鮮魚鮮肉般的菜餚，放在弄堂口；唱了幾個喏，然後又把火柴一擦，燒了錠帛，像紫蝴蝶片片的飛起；這又不是狠好笑的一件事麽？若說人家有了疾病，請個女巫到來，那末：就必定有這套把</p>
<p>戲做哩，呌「斷送客鬼」的法兒。</p>
<p>虹廟裏香烟，眞是繁盛，有個朋友對我說：這一座廟宇，可算是上海的五台山，那逢到廢曆初一月半，一宗香火收入的金錢，不曉得有多少？尤不可解的，那班拜倒於泥塑木雕脚下的善男信女們，究竟爲些什麽？而有狠時髦的名門女滬，也不肯不進去，虔虔誠誠的有所祝禱，唉！以前人說得好：「觀音無别福，受盡美人頭」眞是形容得不差１其實都可以代表舊社會的一個影子。</p>
<h3>一個八歲的心算家</h3>
<p>— 斅厂</p>
<p>吾鄉（平窰）章良明的兒子，年紀只有八歲，因爲家貧，要帮助父母做事，所以還沒有入學。但他有種天生的本領，這本領是一般和他同年或比他大幾歲的。而已在學校裏讀書小朋友們所不能及的。什麽本領呢？就是心算，當他三歲的時侯，已懂得數目。現在，他能把「幾個錢一兩，多少錢一斤，幾個錢一斤，多少錢一兩」的各問題，用心算算出來。但是最大的答數，不能過萬。一般認識他的人，因他有這樣一種天才，都十分歡喜他，常常拉住他的要他算，他不算，不放他走，他算了，便給他銅子或糖果。呌他算的人，因他算起來很快，而又百不一錯，所以故意把較難的數目呌他算。但他不論數目難易，總得立刻答出來，因此大家都稱奇不置。可是章兒是個年紀只有八歲而又未曾受過敎育的苦孩子，他竟有這樣的本領，那麽一般年齡比他大，並且讀過幾年書的小朋友們，對他應當作何感想呢東北四連軍長張恨水著</p>
<h3>第三十回目送哀鴻埋頭守國土彈穿勁臂灑血染孤城</h3>
<p>那城外的槍聲，異常猛烈，砲也不斷的轟擊着。殷得仁自言自語的低聲道：這小子知道咱們不好惹，要退了，故意這樣猛烈射擊。他那聲音越說越小，隨後也就不能說了。過了一小時，天色漸漸的渾亮，敵人已經退却，聽不到什麽響聲，只是空氣中還留着一種硝磺味。有人喊道；二哥，你怎麽啦？殷得仁微睜開眼時，趙自强全身的灰土，臉也是黑的，手上扶了一枝槍，站在身邊。他微笑答道：沒事，我掛了彩啦。自强道：半夜我也上城了。我離着你就不遠，可是沒工夫照應着你，殷得仁道：敵人退了嗎？自强道：不等天亮，他們就退了。我估計着，他們也不過來二三百人。殷得仁微笑道：他們凖備是駭嚇駭嚇我們就成啦。正說時。寳芳帶了兩名弟兄，飛跑過來，走向前彎了腰和殷得仁握了左手道：老殷！你是好的。殷得仁點了幾下頭微笑。天色更是明亮了，只見他所坐的地方，流了好幾塊血漬。同時看他的顏色，變成了蒼白，大櫟是血流得不少。寳芳道：殷連長：你下去休息着罷，呌弟兄們來攙着。殷得仁突然向上站立起來，笑道：胳膀上掛了一點彩，這算不了什麽？走！口裏說時，人可是幌盪了幾下。寳芳道：還是讓人攙着罷。殷得仁左手托住了右手臂，搖着頭道：那末着，可是笑話了。决不决不·他就是這樣的幌盪着，一路走下堡城去。趙自强站在那血漬邊，不免呆了一呆，心想，人家都說殷二哥爲人精明，不好逗，可是遇到大事臨頭，這一股子勁，眞不含糊。我趙自强不算傻種能够不學學人家嗎？殷得仁這一番態度，眞讓他興奮不少，他睜了眼睛，向堡望着，若是有敵人的話，他很願繼續放兩槍呢。（四一七）</p>
<h3>小逛廟行紀</h3>
<p>— 一風</p>
<p>廟行一名米巷鎭，卽一二八中日軍激戰之地也。一昨休沐之暇，余驅車前往，途經北寳興路，粤秀路，江塲路，嶺南路，廟行路，約廿餘里而達。廟行馬路闊三丈，子道上排植樹蔭，綠葉滿枝，風景殊勝，路身高燥，車行甚舒適也。該處舊有村落，被燬於砲火者，殘跡猶依稀存在，鄉人信仰之大廟，尙巋然無恙。廟前有住屋東西各三大列，係戰後救濟會爲災民所起造。屋前廣塲，異常寬坦，農民婦孺，工織嬉遨於其間，怡然自得，頗有模範村風味。　廟北跨河，當局闢地五六十畝，將建築一「無名英雄墓」，以紀念中日戰役中我軍陣亡之忠勇將士，聞不久卽動工。果其成也，余意滬上來參與者，必有車水馬龍之盛。惜馬路僅達廟行，返時須迂迴故道。當局若能於三民路，或由上海市第一公墓開闢一新路，與廟行路啣接，則遊人於憑弔忠魂之餘，又可參觀偉大市中心區，想爲當局所樂爲，或在計劃之中耶？</p>
<p>廟之附近，麻瘋院圈地約八十畝，竪一「麻瘋醫院基地」之木牌，將來卽於此爲院址者。按麻瘋極易傳染，爲患綦大，一經設院，鄰近卽不能居住，卽行道經過，亦易觸受危險。他國多建於偏僻海島，今該院欲建於茲地，不免大殺風景。諒當局及該處農民或未之諗，否則必以遷地爲良，歸而濡筆紀之。（却酬）</p>

<h3>日本東鄉元帥的一段情史</h3>
<p>— 沿</p>
<p>在這一個月裏，日本的政局，非常緊張，而猛然地來了一個海軍上將東鄉平八郎的死耗。日本全國的報紙上，都競載着關於東鄉元帥的事跡，如今我且把東鄉氏在英國留學時代的一段情史，翻譯下來，介紹給讀者們。　從來英雄多好色，這是誰都承認的。東鄉氏在日本人看來，當然是獨一無二的大英雄，好色也是無疑的。當明治四年二月的時候，他受到海軍部的選拔，遣派到英吉利去留學，專攻海軍戰鬭術，在明治十一年五月，學成歸國，其間總共有七年多。在這七年多的留學生活中，刻苦力學，當然佔着十之七八，可是在女人懷裏的生活，也有一二分。他在第一第二兩年中，專門在書本上討興趣。但研究這種殺人的學問，總要比較研究其他學問來得乾燥乏味，所以也不得不在倫敦的咖啡店裏走走。在第一次走入路易士喫茶店的時候，他忠勇樸實的赤心，却給那露臂袒胸的倫敦姑娘陶醉了。加以倫敦姑娘淸脆的英語動人的微笑，來探聽東鄉氏的尊姓大名，這時他心中的緊張，比較俄國波羅的海艦隊到達宇久島附近的時候，還要厲害。因爲他是生長在封建意識極濃厚的家庭中，連帶着笑容的年輕女子，也沒有互相談話過。所以在這一夜，他在牀上，輾轉不能睡眠，其他十位日本留學生，都很以爲怪，第二天大家問他不能睡眠的緣故，他總是紅着臉兒答不出話來。</p>
<p>好容易等到了第二個星期日，他換了一套很乾凈的洋裝，把皮鞋擦得漆黑有光，所有的鬍𩬈，剃得一根不剩，把他的面容再三向鏡子裏照着，總覺得有些不滿足的樣子，而向着路易士咖啡店去了。至於那位倫敦姑娘，却換着一件更華麗的衣服，現着一副更嬌艷的笑容，已在門口等候着，並且說：「先生，我眞正想念你得要生病了。」這話是咖啡店女子的家常語。那裏知道東鄉氏却以爲伊和他已經患着同樣的病征了。因此使東鄉氏說出了許多忠實的話，而倫敦姑娘的咖啡店政策，却也成功了大半，而佛蓮台小姐的名字，（佛蓮台就是咖啡店女招待那位倫敦姑娘的名字）也永遠盤旋在東鄉氏的腦裏。</p>
<p>從此每逢星期日，他的足跡，不是在路易士咖啡店裏，便是形影相偎的和佛蓮台女史在公園中散步。他是很老實的人，也漸漸地懂得些世故了；握手接吻跳舞等等，也不落人後了。他很愛佛蓮台女士，很想和伊結婚，但是想想回國的環境，絕對不允許他這種志願的實現，英雄之淚，却也涓涓地流着。在那時候，佛蓮台因爲母親急病回鄉，在路易士咖啡店請了三星期長假，他却又和另一個女招待戀愛起來。　在佛蓮台回到路易士後，他同着佛蓮台和斐利二人（斐利是另一女招待的名字）同到公園裏去散步，左手緊握着佛蓮台的手，右手緊握着斐利的手，他以爲佛蓮台不知道他緊握斐利的手，同時以爲斐利也不知道他緊握佛蓮台的手，因此使佛蓮台和斐利，不要疑他偏愛對方的人。可是他這種計劃，給斐利當面說破了，斐利的話，就是向東鄉說着：「你的愛我，在握手寬緊的程度上，可以看出。」這使東鄉氏受到最大的恥辱，知恥近乎勇，從此他在倫敦的情史，就告一段落</p>

<h3>南通尹樂仁醫師被控感言</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>南通樂仁醫院院長尹樂仁醫師爲一貧婦深夜施診·該婦係患腦膜炎症，尹醫師爲之注射抗腦膜炎血淸二十公分至一半時，因該婦忽然劇動，其家人之扶助者驚惶失措，致針頭折斷寸餘于其第四五腰椎骨間，尹醫師當卽囑其連夜來院診治，詎料其延不來醫，遂因腦膜炎轉劇而死，頃據尹醫師報告，兩月前有某某者來言，該婦家屬擬控告尹醫師于法院，並索三百元和解，當時尹醫師未允，近乃以庸醫殺人，　出故意，控告尹醫師于南通法院矣。鄙人于尹醫師雖非素識，但向聞其樂善好施，且具有豐富之學識與經騐，决非世之所謂庸醫者可比。其深夜施診，卽足證明其非具有救人之熱忱者不能爲。乃以救人之心，而獲殺人之名；且加以故意二字，試問醫師治病，何必故意殺人。卽此一點，已足使行善者灰心矣！吾人若果進而研究其治療之經過，以及該婦致死之原因，則尹醫師更不負業務上之任何過失，蓋針斷之由，係病者之忽然猛動，與其家人之扶助之力所致，與尹醫師無干，此其一。且斷針僅能固著于骨縫之內，决不隨血流行，致人于死，此其二。尹醫師于針斷之後，曾囑其連夜來院診治，其意卽在一方面取出其斷針，一方面繼續施行腦膜炎診治，蓋因二十公分之血淸僅注入一半故也。若不繼續診治，勢難有希望可言。乃該婦家屬，竟延不來醫，是該婦之死，死于其家屬之自誤，在尹醫師則可謂仁至義盡矣！此其三。</p>
<p>該婦死後，其家屬對于尹醫師並無何種之表示，足見良心尙未泯滅，乃事隔數月，忽以控告聞，則其顯有背景，不難臆斷。緣尹醫師創設醫院於南通以來，因治病之盡力，遂爲南通人士所信仰，一時聲譽甚隆，以致好事者每欲借端敲詐，今幸有機可逞，遂不惜利用一愚蠢之鄉民以濟其欲望。故先有某某者索三百元之和解費，殆所欲不遂，而後圖窮七見，不得不相見於法庭矣！此種人心術之險詐，固不待言，更不足責，獨惜吾輩醫師以善心而獲惡果，爲甚可惜耳·！年來國內之醫病糾紛，層出疊見，究其實際，殆無不有其背景，夫離間醫病以恣其敲詐之所爲，此眞醫界之障碍，尹醫師之事，其一而已！吾人深望尹醫師根據學理事實之立塲，倔强到底，誓與周旋，吾人亦必出全力以爲之助，庶幾正義可維，而醫業亦得所保障，不然，則人爲刀爼，我爲魚肉，其何能謀獨立之生存乎？</p>
<h3>論京市民中毒案</h3>
<p>— 連瑞琦</p>
<p>凡遇中毒事件發生，首應將中毒者經過醫生診斷症狀，加以研究，再請裁判化學專家化騐其吐瀉物，尿，血等，若已死亡，須經法醫檢騐，解剖取其內臟，將解剖鑑定書連同取出之內臟並內容物密封，送交專攻藥學之裁判化學專家化騐。此係應付此類不幸事件上第一步手續。其次須將中毒者之環境檢查，日用品檢查，如平日飲料，食物，居户空氣，隨身衣着，及他種疑似之件，加以番精密之檢騐，此皆應行之正當手續也。</p>
<p>京市中毒案余尙未見全部化騐報告，難以確定批評，祇照近日報載片段，略貢意見而已。查五月十日報載稱四十餘人因食同花華及菊花菜中毒，症狀大部頭痛，頭暈，嘴唇發紫，心跳，面色靑白，曈孔放大，間有惡心欲吐者，並已將食剩之菜及吐出飲菜，送請中央衛生試騐所趕束化騐云云。於此，余欲問所稱同芬華菊花菜食剩之菜及吐出飯菜，是否含有毒質？若有之，係何種毒質？是否與中毒症狀相符？應請衛生當局將化騐結果，明白公佈。又十一日報稱下午又發見十七人，諵查結果，疑是食鹽中毒，先將德興隆泰茂恒兩家停止售鹽。又漢西門及下關地方小店所售食鹽。因被認有毒質嫌疑，警局通知停售。又十二日報載稱漢西門續有中毒，市社會局通知警察局，在案末查明前該處食鹽菜蔬之類，一槪停止售賣云云。於是在上面所述「疑是食鹽中毒」，「被認有毒質嫌疑」，「在案未查明前」，等等模稜案語之下，斷然停止商家營業，舉動未免過當。</p>
<p>總之臨事猶疑，倉皇又復失措，胥由平日一切衛生發令，未完善所致。假使所有飯食品，嗜好品，及吾人日常所用器具，已有規定標凖，並以法令取締，平日又隨時調查，如有販賣不合標凖者，一律禁售，則含有毒質之食物，自不致發見於市塲，因飲食物而中毒者自少，倘有商家不遵法令，一經查明，當由警察衛生各局署，依據條律，執行處罰，商人自無怨言。例如德國，日本及瑞士食鹽標凖，規定良好食鹽爲乾燥白色結晶，但含氯化鎂量達百分之零，二時，則爲引濕性，有苦鹽味，如瑞士生活用品試騐書（ＳchweizerischesLebensmittelpuch)規定純良食鹽爲乾燥白色結晶，無臭氣，具純鹽味，水不溶解性物質及鉀鹽，各含有痕跡，硫酸鈉及硫酸鈣之量，皆在百分之一以下，氯化鎂之量，在百分之零·五以下，重金屬純不可含有。</p>
<p>吾人可知食鹽成分因由氣（Ｚacl）而成，但混合的夾雜物亦很多，衛生署化騐所稱食鹽內含有多量亞硝酸毒質，又稱亞硝酸鹽類，又稱仍含有亞硝酸鈉等語·似有出入。查亞硝酸與亞硝酸鹽異，亞硝酸鈉係亞硝酸鹽之一種，究竟該成分中含有者是亞硝酸抑係亞硝酸鈉，且所謂多量者，究竟若干？含量係百分之幾？皆須明白公佈，至於將小動物體量重一公斤以上兎子三隻，注以○·六毒質鹽，二十分鐘卽死之試騐，固屬審愼，但平日吾人注射食鹽於血管內者乃純粹精製的生理食鹽溶液，若將○·六毒鹽注射於小動物，當然死亡，卽使將普通食鹽，不加精製者，注射於動物體內，恐亦有危險發生。此試騐上尙需審度者一也。再食物經口服食與由血管注入者生理作用上完全不同，此試騐上須加審度者二也·又所謂以○·六注射於動物血管管內者究以若干水量溶解是項鹽化物，換言之其濃度如何？蓋濃度與生理作用亦大有關係，此試騐上更應審度者三也。再據Ｋopest氏報告，有人於一日中服亞硝酸鈉半克多次，並未中毒，又亞硝酸鈉之藥劑量，每次可服○·三克，每日可服一克，今假定食鹽中確係摻雜亞硝酸鈉，但煮菜中應用食鹽絕不能多量，而每人所食之菜蔬中食鹽之含量更屬少數，卽使食鹽中雜有亞硝酸鈉，是否超過中毒量殊屬疑問，此試騐上尤當審度者四也。又查亞硝酸鈉中毒症狀爲小便頻數腹瀉，作惡，有悶絕感覺面色靑白，此與報載此次中毒之現象又不盡符，此試騐上極需審度者五也。至於鹽務署發表「此種病症是否因鹽發生之疑問一如前後所述症狀對照自能明瞭，有無亞硝鈉發見可將同樣食鹽與衛生署恊同化騐，或請第三者化騐，所云「鹽之本身化合物决無毒質，鹽中毒必爲混合物無疑，本署前發表調查眞相，謂鹽中無毒，卽指化合物而言，閱者不察，誤會本署根本否認鹽中有毒，」云云，各語，措詞太覺籠統，不啻表明自已亦未弄淸楚鹽中究竟有無毒質，如果鹽署規定食鹽標凖，經衛生化騐專家鑑定，氯化鈉之百分之幾？混合物百分之幾？若未超過標凖量，卽不能指爲有毒，警察局等，卽不得任意停止鹽商營業。而使商民遭營業之損失。總之如食鹽混有硝酸鈉微量，則或係夾雜物而已，倘屬多量，則另有别情，否則由食鹽或他種物質亦不難判定，綜察報載消息，各方手續，皆有不合，首都數日內中毒者八十餘人，爲空前慘劇，亦爲吾國衛生行政不善之表示，前車可鑒後軫方遒，不難急起直追以求合乎衛生行政之措施，是則有厚望焉，茲撮大略如下。</p>
<p>一，內政部速聘請衞生化學專家，制定各種飲食品，嗜好品，日用品之取締規則。</p>
<p>二，化騐毒物，須由專攻藥學之裁判化學家依據毒物化學分析學分析之。三，鹽務署技正，應聘衛生化學專家充任，各地食鹽，經過標凖的化騐之後，得隨時檢查其成分及含量。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（三十三）急性腸黏膜炎）上（</p>
<p>（問）急性腸黏膜炎是什麽病？</p>
<p>（答）是因爲腸內受各種傳染和剌戟而起的發熱泄瀉的病，從前有許多人譯作急性腸加他兒。</p>
<p>（問）這種病在什麽年齡的時候最容易發生？</p>
<p>（答）在哺乳兒和小兒，差不多隨時可以發生。</p>
<p>（問）急性腸黏膜炎的原因有幾種？</p>
<p>（答）原因很多。我們就大槪而論，可以分下列七種原因：就是（一）由於傳染性微小有機物（像夏季霍亂病的泄瀉），自體中毒（像尿毒症，火傷後泄瀉罐食中毒之類）或數種腸內傳染病的一部症狀，</p>
<p>（二）飲食的不攝生（像狂飲暴食，不消化食物，冰冷飲料，腐敗食物，未熟水果之類）。</p>
<p>（三）感冒。</p>
<p>（四）剌戟黏膜的藥劑。（像自殺者的誤飲强酸或鹼類，乖砒和大量瀉藥之類）。</p>
<p>（五）器械的剌戟（像硬糞，嚥下的果核銅幣，腸寄生蟲，頻度洗腸之類）。</p>
<p>（六）血行障礙，（像心臟病，腎病，肝疾患等）</p>
<p>（七）</p>
<p>間或因腹部傷害而起的。</p>
<p>（問）本病的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）急性腸黏膜炎的主要病狀，是泄瀉</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>，腹痛，發熱，小便濃厚。</p>
<p>（問）泄瀉的情形怎麽樣？</p>
<p>（答）大便每天排洩二三回到十數回以上。濃度，有的像稀粥狀，有的甚至像水狀，程度不定。通常呈黃色，或混以膽汁而呈綠色。便中常混黏液，放强度之惡臭。</p>
<p>（問）腹痛的情形怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）腹痛的持續性的有發作性像疝痛那樣的。若直腸內發黏膜炎伴、有裏急後重。</p>
<p>（問）除腹痛外，還有什麽症狀？</p>
<p>（答）還有口渴，食慾减退，同時侵害胃臟因而發惡心嘔吐，舌被厚苔。有時腹部膨滿和壓痛，口唇發匐行疹。</p>
<p>（問）病人的體溫和全身怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）體溫上昇到三十八度至三十九度，脈搏細數，四肢冷却，顏貎憔悴，在重症有呈腓腸肌痙攣和虚脫症狀。</p>
<p>（問）病人的小便怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）尿液濃厚，靛靑反應陽性，重症的在尿中得證明蛋白質和圓柱體。</p>
<p>（問）急性腸黏膜炎病人的一般症狀是不是一律的嗎？</p>
<p>（答）並不一律。應視發炎的部位在腸管的那一部分而有異同。</p>
<p>（問）假使發炎部分在小腸中的時候怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）這時候發炎雖在小腸，但因爲很少專限於這部分的。所以診斷不很容易。糞便呈粥狀，並不起泄瀉，混有極少量的黏液，或黃色的黏液顆粒。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識續</h3>
<p>— 唐仁</p>
<p>（四）談談一種由淋疾而來的眼病</p>
<p>淋疾又稱白濁。現在可算得是一種摩登病。我們祗要看山得爾米地同樂的能的銷路。和到處掛着包治花柳病招牌的醫生。就知道這個病的多了。所以我要談的一種由淋疾而來的眼病。也就一天一天的多起來。這個眼病在醫學上呌做淋疾性結膜炎。日本人因爲這個病。發的時候狠迅速。失明來得又快。彷彿同風一樣。所以一般俗間有風眼的名詞。又因發病時候。眼部的膿汁。像漏壺一樣的滴漏。故在醫學上又稱膿漏性結膜炎。他發生在成人的時候。就稱成人性膿漏眼。發生在初生小兒的時候。就稱初生兒膿漏眼。我現在先把成人性膿漏眼發病的情形講一講。</p>
<p>這種眼病的起源。大都從自已生了尿道淋疾的膿汁。或從别個淋疾病人的膿汁。直接或間接傳染眼部。經過從半天到三天的時候。忽然發生同急性結膜炎（俗稱紅眼睛）一樣的症候。就是眼臉結膜（俗稱眼皮裏面）發赤，腫脹，流淚。這時候病家常常當做是普通眼病。並不留意。等到眼球結膜（俗稱眼白）發赤腫脹。或來浮腫。眼臉）眼皮（因爲過度腫脹而下垂，用手輕壓。卽感疼痛。眼內流出黃色液體。病人眼內感覺灼熱。或像有物夾在眼內一樣。這時候不壓眼臉。也是疼痛難堪。病人也就方才發生恐惶。經過兩三天後。發赤腫脹的程度减輕。疼痛也緩解一點。然眼內流出的黃色液體。反增多。變爲純粹濃厚的膿汁。像牛奶一樣。從眼內時時溢流。一如泉源而無已時。病人苦於揩眼。膿漏眼的名稱。就是因爲這個流膿的現象而有的啊。他最危險的時候。就在角膜（俗稱眼黑）發生潰瘍的時候。因爲潰瘍容易穿孔。一旦穿孔。那就眼內的內容物。像水晶體，玻璃體，虹彩等。都要脫出。變爲葡萄腫（俗稱蟹珠）而失明這是多麽可慘可憐可惜的一回事啊。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（十）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第五章病理解剖</p>
<p>關於病理解剖的部分，是比較最乾燥無味，而難了解其究竟的：對醫家尙且如此，尋常的讀者，當然是更加不言而可喻的了！但難懂歸難懂，佔的位置，確是非常重要的。第一，我們要想徹底明白每一疾病的究竟，是非靠病理解剖方面的報告不行的。遠一點且不必去說他，卽如上面所講過的最初傳染的經過情形，和肺結核患者數目統計，是完全拿屍體解剖來證明的。第二，每一疾病的分類，尤其是肺結核症，雖然臨床上的症象，不無幾分根據，但歸根到底，也是憑藉這言面的報告演繹出來的。如果我們捨此不談，而祇注重外面的情形經過，是和隔鞋搔癢無異樣的：就是科學醫和舊醫所走的途徑，根本上也就沒有什麽區别了。在本篇的通俗文字裏面，雖然感覺讀者們的了解，是萬分困難的；但我覺得專章的叙述，總究是省不了的。</p>
<p>結核症在人體裏面，係呈如何的病理解剖變化呢？這一個問題的答覆當然是千頭萬緒的，但歸根到底，用一名話來表明，這就是病理學裏面的炎症了。他的現象，係不外血管系統和局部組織二方面的障礙；最初呈局部充血狀態，所謂炎性充血是；繼則組織浸潤，最後則結締組織增生而致組織變性，這四種的經過，尋常一般的炎症，大槪總如此的。他的病變，雖係局部，但移轉的情形，確是非常複雜的。根據他的病變性質，係有滲出性變性增生性炎症的分别的。在結核症方面發炎的經過情形。係完全包括在滲出性增生性二種表面的。</p>
<h3>人參（三）</h3>
<p>— 趙燏黃</p>
<p>高麗參中之别直參，卽日本之所謂紅參。自朝鮮及日本輸入，係用水參蒸過再曝乾而烘燥之。市肆販賣品，長約Ｉ３－１５公分尺，直徑約１·５２公分尺，枝根約０·５公分尺，鬚根均已除去，其最良品成鷄腿形或人形，質重而呈飴色，內部滋潤而紅，通常根之上部帶紅棕色，不透明，下部紅黃色，微微透明，味甘而微苦。此根因蒸熟，而細胞中澱粉均已糊化，故成角質之狀態，本根目下屬日本政府之專賣品。</p>
<p>組織</p>
<p>（甲）廓大鏡觀察將人參平滑之橫切面，以廓大鏡檢視之，見有白色之外皮部與淡黃色之內皮部，以白色之形成　輪綫，與黃棕色之第二期中心柱（後生中心柱）相分劃。篩管之尖端，着色較爲濃厚，成屈折彎曲之現象，而伴以體綫。且往往有小缺裂，並發現黃棕色之小點，此爲其樹脂道。第二期中心柱以內，漸次色淡，近於黃白色，達於中心而純白，此卽第一期中心柱，（初生中心柱，）往往有導管（第一期初生導管）之小點散在之。中心柱作放射狀之綫紋而射出。達於第二期中心柱處，則見有散布之白點，卽導管（第二期後生導管）</p>
<p>之部分也。</p>
<p>（乙）顯微鏡觀察用顯微鏡檢查之，其栓層部之不免有多少之剝落，往往僅留其殘餘物，其殘餘物之完整者，有三層至四層薄璧性栓細胞，與之連續者爲外皮部，（第一期）組織疎鬆，細胞膜甚爲菲薄，而以切綫性延長之，細胞中含澱粉者甚少，常有大樹脂道及粘液細胞，中含黃色之分泌物而嵌在之，再進一層，爲內皮部，（第二期）境界雖不分明，組織較爲緻密，細胞中含有澱粉，順髓綫之方向而有裂隙。篩部之構成，均爲細小之細胞，其內亦發現樹脂道而甚狹細，惟石柱之樹脂道，口徑較廣，自篩部起至外皮都止，占居切線之方向，環列三周，木部缺髓，初生導管，存於中心，後生導管連絡於半徑綫，作放射狀而排列之，髓綫介於導管部之問以一列至三四列與維管束並行射出，草酸鈣成簇晶或單晶，（簇晶居多）皮部木部，均有存在。縱切面中，見形成層附近之導管，成螺旋紋而有節，以二三條連結成羣。篩管之末稍，頽廢者居多。澱粉大半糊化，妨毒其他組織之淸明。並於本品之根端，發見螺旋紋短管，初生時之聚集狀况，及細胞之分裂組織層。　白參及紅參調製法（一）白參，人參出土時，外色灰黑。取竹彎弓，擴以絃綫，鋸去黑膚（拴皮）之大半。內皮部尙富於乳白汁。味極苦，故須調製而後可用。其法：選取整個之人參，勿去其鬚部。（若新鮮時去其參鬚，則中含之乳白澤外　　　　　同建冰　　　　　　入沸水之釜。約在四五分鐘中，煮至半黃色，速卽取之（煮至過度則原味淡而變紅）於是裝入高四寸，長二尺，　尺半之木匣中，匣以玻璃爲蓋，匣之板底，穿孔通氣。復鋪竹簾於其上。簾上置參。暴於日光以乾燥爲度，暴乾後成淡黃色。可貯藏於密閉之生石灰缸中，則自然永久而不敗壞。所謂糖白抄參微糖白抄參糖，卽調製本參時所得之副產物也。</p>
<p>（二）紅參。國產紅參如石柱參等，大抵採用朝鮮之製法者也。朝鮮紅參之製法大要，卽將秋季採掘之根莖，西　洗滌，除去土砂等之附着物。以一二日曝乾之後，卽行蒸氣法。其供用之釜，普通口徑一尺六寸；　徑二尺三寸，</p>

<h3>美國限制棉產問題</h3>
<p>— 蔣迪先</p>
<p>近來有一件引起世界棉業界嚴重注意的問題，卽美國限制棉產之彭海德提案，已由美國參衆兩院通過與羅斯福總統之批准而宣告實行矣。</p>
<p>美國棉產，占全世界總額之半，對於棉花供求關係甚鉅，各國棉價漲落，固受美棉之支配；卽紗布市况，亦與美棉有密切之關係。故美棉减產案之實行，足以引起世界棉業界之嚴重注意。</p>
<p>自一九二九年以降，世界經濟衰落，棉貨貿易尤劣，棉花消費，亦隨之而减。但美棉，棉花消費</p>
<p>產量，不但未與消費俱减，一九三一年有豐收，致一九三二年七月底世界滾存美棉達一千三百餘萬包之多，棉價亦呈反比而跌至五分。美國朝野，一致提出减種口號，一九三二年之棉田，確較上年减少，但產額仍與消費相等，大量存底，依然未减。因是當年收棉後之减產宣傳，更形緊張。詎料一九三三年下種之棉田，反較三二年增多。新就職而以復興自命之羅斯福總統大恐，乃有剷除棉田之政策。棉田由下種之四千萬畝，剷留不足三千萬畝。剷田政策雖成功，而棉收又告豐稔，棉田較上年少五百萬畝，棉產仍達一千三百萬包。美國當局，鑒於此種情形，非有進一步之限產計劃，無以使棉價穏定，因此而有彭海德减產案，（ＢanklieapBiiiHester）</p>
<p>彭氏减產案，在歲初已經發現，經長期之延擱與多次之修改，至四月二十一日方由總統批准施行。在此期間，不特美棉市况，完全爲此案進行情形所左右。實則各國棉業市塲，殆無不因彭案而轉移。美英印度等國棉市報告中，常有「静待彭案人發展」，「因彭案失望而跌」，及「因彭案發展而堅」之語句，可以證明。</p>
<p>彭案在美議院中，幾經修改，最初）三月二日（由衆院農業委員會提出衆院之要點：（一）一九三四！三五年之棉產額，限爲九百萬包；（二）過於限額，每磅抽特稅一角二分。二十七日參院加以修改：爲（一）總產額不得過一千萬包；（二）每一棉農所產之最先六包，得免繳稅；（三）一吋半以上　維之棉花，得免繳稅；（四）超過規定之限額者，照市價繳稅百分之七十五。四月十三日參衆兩院聯合會，復加修正；（一）逾額棉花在出售時，繳稅百分之五十；（二）删除棉農各有免稅棉花六包；（三）此案有效時間一年，惟棉農請求展期時，總統得延長一年。至十七日完全通過，送交白宮，羅斯福於二十一日簽署批准之。彭案之經過及其方法，大槪如此。</p>
<p>限制棉產，以維持棉價，似爲美國一致贊同之政策。但實際上反對者亦大有其人。卽如參院討論此案時，共和黨議員反對甚力。謂强迫限制，將導成南方革命！故修正之第二三兩條，卽所以减輕本案之力量。然最後通過者，仍爲原有條文。如照參院修正，爲效甚微，現有棉價，卽有不易維持之虞矣。</p>
<p>有人以爲此案雖經批准，結果如何，尙有待於事實之表現，此種疑慮，固屬甚當。但以美國政治現狀言，大槪可得相當成績，證以上年剷田之結果，可以證明。故現在研討此事，其重心不在實施之能否成功？而在成功後利害如何？</p>
<p>美國之實行限制棉產，最大原因，爲存棉太多，棉價太低，非限制减產！不足以减少存棉，非减少存棉，不足維持棉價。茲先將美棉最近數季間之生產消費及滾存數量，作簡略之觀察，（單位五百磅大包）</p>
<p>上季末滾存　本季生產　本季銷費</p>
<p>一九二八│二九年　五、二九八、○○○一四、四七八、○○○一五、○七六、○○○一九二九│三○年三、六七九、○○○一四、八二八、○○○一三、○二三、○○○一九三○│三一年六、三四○、○○○一三、九三二、○○○一○、九○八、○○○一九三一│三二年八、一三○、○○○一七、○九六、○○○一二、三一九、○○○一九三二│三三年一三、四四九、○○○一三、○○二、○○○一四、一七○、○○○一九三三年三四年一一、七八三、○○○一三、○四、○○○七、○一八、○○○一九三四│三五年：：：：：一○、○○○、○○○（註）表中滾存根據海斯脫氏（Ｈester）報告，生產根據美農部最後修正估計，消費根據萬國紡總會報告，一九三三│三四年消費爲上半季，一九三四│三五年生產以美政府限額爲凖。</p>
<p>一九三二年六月份美棉現貨跌至五分之低價，卽上表「一九三二│三三年上季末滾存」達一千三百四十四萬九千包之結果。美國關於棉業之統計甚詳，時時能用統計推算未來供求之盈虚，因所有統計數字皆極正確，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　况每隨推算結果之趨勢而轉移。在一九三一年棉產豐收估計發表後，從消費以推算季末滾存，將大增加，棉價途逐步下落而至五分。美棉跌至五分，除因生產增加外，消費減少，亦一原因。上表消費由一九二八年起激減，亦爲促進滾存大增之重要原因。美棉跌至五分時，比較世界其他棉價皆低，同時一九三一年在美棉爲豐產，而印度及我國適告歉收，美棉在此兩種特殊情形之下，故自一九三一年起，消費又復趨增。最近二年，生產雖未减少，但以消費進步，滾存因以漸减。本季上半季（一九三三年八月至一九三四年一月底世界消費美棉爲七，零一八，零零零包，就目前美棉銷費狀况言之，大約下半孚不過與上半季相等。茲假定本季總消費量爲一千四百萬包，刋入上表，推算本季末（一九三四年七月底）之滾存約爲一千零七十萬包，比較上季末减少一百萬包。目前棉價能較上季同時漲起二三分者，最大原因，卽在於此。現在美政府實行限制本季棉產爲一千萬包，則以上述推算之本季末滾存１計算下一季（卽一九三四│三五年）美棉總供給量爲二千零七十萬包，比較本季减少四百萬包之多若下季消費而與本季相同，約一千四百萬包，則下季末之滾存，將降爲六百七十萬包，約與上表一九二九│三零年一季末相近。查此一季間美棉最高價爲一九·五五，最低價爲一二·四五，平均價爲一六·六零。如上述推論竟與實際相符，自現時起，隨時日之前進而逐步實現，屏除其他關係，則目前棉價，尙在最低地位。今後亦將隨推論之逐步實現，漸漸上漲，可達一九·五五之最高價。不過足以左右棉價之原因固多，而上述推算能否與事實相符，亦無把握。例如美棉價格果竟上漲，卽足以影響其消費量，而使上述推論爲之動搖也。</p>
<p>自一九二八│二九年以後，美棉消費减少，由於世界經濟衰落，棉貨貿易不振，銷棉總額减少，美棉占額最多，减率較大。近年世界銷棉增加，美棉之增率，比較其他棉花特大。次於美棉之印棉，且告减少，此中當然有供給多寡之關係，而價格之貴賤，亦有影響。試以過去數年每半年世界銷棉與棉價比較於下。</p>
<p>美棉　印棉　其他棉　上海標棉</p>
<p>消費量最高價最低價　消費量最高價最低價　消費量　最高價最低價</p>
<p>一九三○年上半年五、九四○、○○○一七·五五一三·二五三、一○二○○○三○九·○○二○一·○○二、九六五、○○○三七·四○三四·三五下半年五、二四八、○○○一三·六五一○·一五三、○一三、○○○二一四·○○一七○·○○二、八七三、○○○三六·四○三一·○五一九三一年上半年五、六三○、○○○一一·三五八·二五二、八五○、○○○二二四·○○一五九·○○二、八四四、○○○四○·四五·三三·四五下半年六、一一七、○○○一○·三五六·○○二、八一二○○○二○四·二○一三四·二○二、六○一、○○○三九·○○三○·三○三五一九三二年上半年六、二○二、○○○七·二五五·○○一、九七六、○○○二三七·二五一五○·二五二、六一四、○○○三三·二○二七·○○下半年六、八四七、○○○九·二○五·七○二、○五九、○○○二六八·○○一九○·○○二、九七六、○○○三五·四○二九·七○一九三五年上半年七、三二三○○○一○·四五五·九○二、一六一、○○○二一九·○○○一六八·五○二、九八六、○○○三三·七五二九·三四下半年七、○一八、○○○一一·七五八·六五二、三五三、○○○二一五·五○一七五·五○三、一四八、○○○三五·二七·四六　（註）消費皆以五百磅包爲單位，價格美棉單位分，印棉羅比，上海標棉單位兩，自一九三二年下半年起，須减去一·七五兩，以爲比較，因一九三二年以後標凖等級較以前高一·七五兩。</p>
<p>從上表已可顯見近年世界銷棉量與棉價之關係。目前各棉價格，比較一九三三年下半年，美棉高於其最高價；印棉及上海標準均低於其最高價，略與其高低平均價相近。如以目前價格與一九三二年上半年相較，美棉幾漲一倍，而印棉及中棉尙不及彼時之最高價，故現時美棉價格，比諸印棉中棉皆高。近年美棉消費之增加，（尤其是中日兩國之增加）因美棉價廉而供給又多之故。現在一方面價格大漲，一方面又限制產額，以减少供給量，同時印棉及中棉產量旣增，價格又廉，紡廠勢將少用美棉而多用其他棉花。蓋目前世界棉貨貿易，並未能與美棉價格呈相等比率之進步。比較昻貴之棉花，當然不能爲一般紡廠所歡迎。如是則上　推論之，季美棉消費量，殆將因價格而變動，或不足一千四百萬包，下季末之滾存，亦不至降至七百萬包以下，價格自亦未可以一九二九│三零年一季間爲凖矣。</p>
<p>其次，近年新興植棉國甚多，英國尤努力於其屬地植棉之發展，如美國厲行减產，他國旣感美棉供給之缺乏，又苦美棉價格之較貴，將愈樂於購用其他國家之棉，而愈足以促其植棉之進步，果爾，則美棉雖限制生產，世界原棉之總供給量，依然不致大减，美國减產以求與消費適應之目的，勢必失敗。且棉價之穏定，端視世界經濟與棉貨貿易之能否復興，非僅减產所能　功也。</p>
<p>美國近年之國際貿易狀况，亦不十分美滿；尤賴大宗農產輸出，使對外貿易能告平衡。而棉花實爲農產之最著；故在美經濟上言之，减產亦未必能持久。是以彭氏减產案之期限，初爲三年，旋改一年，殆亦有感於此。故吾人對於美棉减產之彭海　案，微覺其近乎渺無把握之一種試騐而已。</p>
<h3>國人衣料消費量之估計子休</h3>
<p>！每人每年：：約爲八碼半：：不足兩套短衫褲！</p>
<p>我國大多數平民所用衣料，除南部各處</p>
<p>夏季間用蔴織品或草織品，北部各處冬季或用老羊裘外，餘幾全用棉布。上等衣料如家蠶絲野蠶絲人造絲及羊毛織品，每種年銷額估計不過在十萬擔左右，至多當不出二十萬擔；若平均分配於全國人民，殊微末不足道。故估計衣料消費不妨專就棉布而論。我國棉布消費量，按機紡棉紗產銷量推算，常年約在八百五十萬擔左右（一）。手工紡紗之數未計算在內，此八百五十萬擔，當微嫌偏低。然手工紡紗之產量從各方面推測，約計年不過數十萬擔，似正可與棉布作衣着以外之用項相抵。故八百五十萬擔之數當可作爲實在用作衣料之凈數。據此計算，我國人口約四萬萬，每人消費額得二斤二兩。普通粗布每疋長四十碼，寬一碼，重十斤，卽每斤四碼；二斤二兩正合八碼半，或八方碼半。八方碼半之棉布，不足供兩套短衫褲之用，論者或將疑其偏低乎，請以家計調查證之。</p>

<h3>雜談讀書作文和大衆語文學</h3>
<p>— 葉聖陶</p>
<p>昨天稜　先生「文言的前途」一篇文章裏的稜　先生「文言的前途」一篇文章裏的話說得非常透切，他說：「在五四時代反對白話文和在今日提倡文言文的人是不相同的：前者决不容認白話，後者只要人能寫四書五經式的白話文，一定能够容認。只因爲要寫白話的人寫四書五經式的文章决不可能，於是仍只有提倡文言。他們也知道復興文言文並不可能，但他們以爲至少可以逸强人讀一點古書。」讀一點古書做甚麽呢？至多像他們一樣，自已陷在沒落的退潮裏，同時給前進的船隻一點輕微的阻力罷了。這是實在的情形，可是他們决不肯相信。他們的生活决定他們的意識，從他們的意識出發，去處理敎育上的問題，不能不得到這樣的結論，就是把古書的內容和形式一古腦兒裝到靑年的頭腦裏去。他們以爲這樣做是最合理的，否則就對不起靑年。我們不想做甚麽猜測，說他們别有用意，存着不好的心腸。但是，顯然的，他們沒有理會到人是常常跟着環境而有改變的，他們沒有理會到人的生活的改變從來沒有像現今這般的迅速和劇烈、他們更沒有理會到生活有了改變，而其他應當跟着一同改變的却停頓着沒有改變，在個人方面是多麽大的不幸。遭到這種不幸的人的實例不必到遠處去找，只要看我們自已就是，雖然他們决不肯相信、</p>
<p>如果他們的願望實現了，這就是說，在敎育上，眞個把古書的內容和形式一古腦兒裝到靑年的頭腦裏去了，結果怎樣呢？那是很容易想到的：大部分的靑年不肯放鬆現實生活，對比下來，他們覺得現實生活完全不是這麽一回事，立刻把被裝進頭腦裏去的丢了出來，像丢掉一個不足顧惜的爛蘋果。少數靑年呢，或者因爲特殊的關係，能够寫幾篇像今年年初本市中學會考第一名所作的「禮義廉恥國之四維論」那樣的文章。丢了出來同根本不曾裝進去差不了多少，自不用說。只有寫得出第一名的文章的人給與提倡者一種安慰，然而這種安慰太微弱了。所以提倡者的失望是必然的，失望的因子就包含在他們的意識裏邊。</p>
<p>現今的在校靑年說不定眞會遇到這樣的一天，硬被人家「裝」這麽一下。只須看一些執着武器的人都在呐喊着「裝啊！裝啊！」而一班搖着鵝毛扇的謀士也從旁響應着「裝啊！裝啊！」就約略可知道一點消息。靑年遇到了這樣的一天，對於古書的道理當然無所領會，古文也一定寫不通。然而這並不是靑年的重大的災難，至多使學校敎育成爲空白的一頁罷了。他們離開了學校，或者說，他們丢開了學校的敎訓和課業，自會從現實生活當中建立他們的意識，寫通足以表現他們的意識的文章。寫通文章，途徑只在手讀書，這本來是很可笑的話。寫通了文章，而只像鸚鵡一般說些甚麽，這尤其是沒有意義的事。必須根源於現實生活，文章才眞能寫通，寫來才眞有意義。靑年只要認淸這一層，卽使硬被人家「裝」這麽一下，也就沒有甚麽關係，好像我們的老祖母在我們耳朶旁邊念「多心經」「大悲咒」和我們沒有甚麽關係一樣。最近幾位先生在「自由談」提出的「大衆語文學」，該是我們現實生活當中最切用的工具。胡愈之先生更給大衆語文學下了個內容形式都包括在內的規定，說這是表達大衆意識的文學，尤其使人容易辨認。除了執着武器的以及搖着鵝毛扇的，誰不是大衆裏的一個，誰不需要大衆語文學？被除外的少數人不滿意白話文，他們要回到文言，回到讀古書，依他們的道理講是不錯的。但是大衆也不滿意白話文，他們覺得白話文太空泛了，單把「的了嗎呢」，換去「之乎者也」毫無意識，文學必須眞能表達大衆的意識，才配在社會中間盡交通情意的職分。自然，大衆語文學須由大衆的努力，才得建立起來，敎育家，語言學家，文學家等等尤其要特别努力。這些「家」</p>
<p>中間有搖着鵝毛扇的，他們當然無望，我們只有切望着不搖鵝毛扇的那一批。今天（廿二日看見中華日報的「動向」欄登載耳耶先生的「話跟話底分家」，剖析語文的所以差異，是一篇精密通達的文章。像這樣的文章，在「大衆語文學」剛被提出的現在，我們希望各「家」多多寫作。</p>
<h3>初夏的黃昏</h3>

<p>看夏凉透樹枝，</p>
<p>一片沙</p>

<p>半個屋影移向牆，</p>
<p>我在黃昏時散步，</p>
<p>静看黃昏，</p>
<h3>北平與駱駝</h3>
<p>— 林熙</p>
<p>我是個愛北平的人。和許多朋友談到北平時，他們也都感到北平的可愛：但可愛的原因，他們却各有各的說法。到過北平的說，北平的衣食住行是如何的合於他們的經濟狀况，一條兩三元錢的藍布大褂，可以穿四季，花上一毛錢黃包車可以坐十幾里，而且拉車的又是那麽穏健，那麽敏捷，坐上去比那兒的車子都來得舒服些。至於食，「東來順」，「潤明樓」，肯花個三毛二毛，便可食海參，火腿，猪腰子：：：等不大常食的食品，這怕是那兒也食不來的。住的更不用說了，北平人最愛陳設，一進門便是三兩株石榴花，夾竹桃，西粉蓮之類，又樸素，又可愛；一拐過「齋莊中正」的紅門，又是什麽遍桃啦，丁香啦，美人蕉啦，榆葉梅啦，種種帶着北方氣味的花草，引人入勝：可是這種地方，二三十間房，一兩個大院子，租起來每月也不過二三十元之譜；較在上海等地花七八元錢住鴿籠的，也就眞有天淵之别了。</p>
<p>至於沒到過北平的呢，他們總憧憬着皇帝的室家，什麽故宮的瓦是怎樣的一片黃；什麽紫禁城，御河橋，昆明湖，太液池，是怎樣的壯麗；學校是怎樣多，居民是怎樣誠樸，沒有沿海人的那股油滑勁　他們說來也都是各有理　由的，若說到具體的象徵呢，我覺得還是駱駝。穿駝絨的未必便感到駱駝那東西的溫馴；住北平的也不見得知道駱駝怎樣的像北平。</p>
<p>有人說，要知道北平的好處，得在北平住過一些年月：這話不是沒有道理的。一個住過北平五六年的美國敎士對我說過：我初到北平，簡直把北平恨死了。春天和冬天的狂風，刮得灰塵蔽日，喘氣也喘不過來；樹木剛一發芽，太陽便囇得野狗滿街吐舌頭，柏油路上推糞車，薰得好幾條大街都是臭烘烘的：：：可是現在好多了，我眞愛秋天的霜和落葉，我聽慣了黃昏時候的軍號聲，淸晨霧氣裏城外火車的嗚咽，夜深時小販的呌賣聲；最後，他的結論是：北平是現世界的一個最有詩意的城。</p>
<p>可是他仍然沒有看到駱駝。</p>
<p>駱駝，那麽一個龐大的動物，走起路來，長長的腿，那麽一頓，一頓；長長的脖子那麽一點一點：富於脂肪的駝峯那麽一恍一恍的，眞會把個性急的人氣死。然而這也就是北平了，和北平分别十多年再回到北平的，看不出多大的變更來：上海增高了多少洋樓，南京加多了多少官署，而北平還是北平，還是灰的，古老的（也不見得更灰，更古老。）！！這就像駱駝的步伐永遠那樣紓緩而穏健。</p>
<p>任憑你是多麽無懷古情緒的人，當你和城門外的那老當益壯的敵樓對峙一下，你不想起那唱着「望敵樓」的古將軍，你也會懷疑到那樓當初是怎麽蓋的；那麽雄偉，那麽灰，站定了脚跟看透了古和今。這時，若有那麽一隊駱駝，撞着沉悶的鈴鐺，從古城下的楊柳行中踱過來：穿着和皮膚相稱的滿身藍的駝夫，拉着長長的繩在前面陪着駱駝踱：你看了古老的敵樓，城垜，和走個百八十里不抬頭的動物相對照，眞會使你無形中把你自已當作一地城垜，或者古敵樓上的一道飛簷了。</p>
<p>前門是北平最繁華的地方，除了兩個火車站不算外，九丈九的正陽門下有兩路電車晝夜不停的轟轟着，有一九三四年的汽車衝來衝去，黃包車的鈴鐺，永無斷絕地向行人耳裏灌；可是也有明朝的大車，捲着灰塵，頗爲迅速地從前門橋上逛過：更有趣的還是駱駝隊，任你怎樣喧吵，怎樣着急，那東西總不失常態地蹈一步是一步地在那兒踱。</p>
<p>所以我說過：要知道北平的好處，得在正陽門下看駱駝。北平不是野路撒冷，不是古羅馬，不是巴黎，不是倫敦，北平是北平。</p>
<p>說到駱駝的豪放處，堅忍處，樸實處，好像得　想到北方的大平原，塞外的寒風，和在風沙裏過日子的良善的人羣了。</p>
<p>在北平，古老的城和樓永向着駱駝悵望；駝毛落了，綠上樹梢頭了。駝毛長了，秋風吹來冷意了；永是這樣的。</p>
<h3>不是趣談</h3>
<p>— 西村</p>
<p>這不是趣談，而是一件事實，雖然趣談中也有事實的成分在。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的，聽說最近的東北，有一些大城市（像長春，瀋陽，哈爾濱，吉林，安東，大連），設置了所謂「狗圈」這麽一種殺人東西。把一羣狼狗配合生出來的狗，（據說比原來狼狗本性要兇暴十倍）關在一個「圈裏」，起初每天喂猪肉牛肉，後來就喂人肉了。</p>
<p>這些人肉的來源，就是各地奔走的旅客，只要是軍警當局認爲不是善類，「危害新國」的罪過馬上就成立了。如果旅客不能在當地找到舖保，好，不管三七二十一，整整一個活人，架起來，就弄到「狗圈」裏去；就此結束了性命。</p>
<p>聽說死在「狗圈」下的旅客，</p>
<p>已經有很多的人，但這只是一個起始，以後呢？以後入圈的人，誰知有多少！</p>
<p>能够把這件事實當成趣談看待麽？當成趣談講給别人聽麽？不，這不是趣談，而是十足地證明出日本帝國主義殘殺無辜弱小民族手段的毒辣，同時也可以說是殺人手法的進步。　前幾天報紙上的東北消息中，曾經讓我們看到了日本帝國主義殺人利器的新發明「絞人機」，據說殺人辦法是「先以重金收買流氓漢奸及吸雅片打嗎啡等敗類，四出探訪暫時隠避各地之義軍，或有識靑年，凡不甘供日人遺使者，均認爲有「反滿行爲」，於是，就捉了去推入「絞人機」內。倘若我們仔細比較一下，同是殺人，前後兩者還各有不同：後者殺人，先要打探一下，（不管是怎樣方法打探，總該說聲是難得的）而且絞起人來還要費些時間親自下手；至於前者，何等便利！捉人旣然不須探聽，殺人也只消假手於凶獸就得了，看來他們帝國主義者直接動手殺害少數的奴隸倒有些「不屑爲。」</p>
<p>也許將來這「不是趣談」眞會變成「趣談」的，因爲這種事實很有增多的可能。</p>
<h3>霧</h3>
<p>— 高爾基近作宜閑譯</p>
<p>城市上瀰漫着黃灰色的陰濕，這好比是濕的烟罷，如果烟也有濕的。在你前面五步，潮氣顯得這麽濃重，甚至也可以說，這麽凝固，似乎那邊再也不會有着空氣似的！！無疑地，空氣一定埋沒在這昏黃的陰濕裏了。但是你同走到什麽霧裏一樣，一到這中間，却也不過覺得呼吸困難起來，兩眼沒有精神罷了。</p>
<p>大城市的一切聲響希奇地融成了單調的含糊的吼呌：間或也有希罕的汽車喇叭聲；間或你也聽得到更希罕的人聲，可是這却因爲你巴望着的緣故纔聽到的。銅鐘已經失去了聲調上的悠揚。那鐘聲並不照平時那樣緩緩地消隠下去，却猛可地停谁；彷彿每次鐘聲響了，就有人拿帽子罩在鐘樓上似的。船上的汽笛聲也沒有勁兒，彷彿那隻船不願在霧裏冒險，或是有些厭倦了。</p>
<p>在這霧的裏外，奔馳着流汗的街車以及看去好像塗着油的馬拉的車輛。濕漉漉的行人們古怪地默着；他們聳起了大衣領；兩手深深地插在袋裏，向前伸着頭，大踏步走來走去，那怱促的神氣暗示出要逃避什麽災難的衝動來。霧將他們囚禁在半透明的水泡裏了！！人在這水泡裏，好像蛋白裏的蛋黃。</p>
<p>蜷伏在潮濕的牆邊的兩位年老的太太用勁地撑着一把大大的黑傘，那傘端撞在旁邊一個矮胖子的身上，他喊了一聲！！這時候，兩位年老的太太好像機械的玩具一般，用同一的姿勢將兩手舞動了一下，便全身震顫，發出全是驚歎詞所湊成的話句來。</p>
<p>店舖的櫉窗和房屋的牆壁上蒙着濕的灰塵。一切似乎溶化着，有着柔和的輪廓，彷彿是春天所見的不潔的冰塊造成的。我們的想像和幻想合奏了。如果連天文學者都不知道，太陽炸裂了，死的月亮溶化了，那大塊的稀薄的液體冷到鮮牛奶的溫度，於是用了窒息的氣體樣的陰濕，用了莫明其妙的濕性的腐敗作用所剝蝕的泥土地，將地球包圍起來，那可怎麽樣呵！這個數百萬人所居住的大城市已經開始溶化了，不多久牠的石呀，玻璃呀，金屬呀，木材呀都要在濃厚的湍流裏静静地流着流着，而且這些還要蒸發爲黃灰色的烟霧的。。</p>
<p>然而這城市裏的人們不多久却就將興奮的想像的幻景驅除了。第一件使我們淸醒的物事就是警察：！！從一個模子裏澆出來的石像似的傢伙，牠的行動是具着機械的精密和平穏的。一切街道上的警察都一樣，人便驚惶地忌憚那權力，那地球上最精悍的强盜，卽「貴族集團」的文化用以剝奪人們的人性的權力了。</p>
<p>警察的手，那有力的維持物序的槓桿。將汽車，貨車，馬車從霧裏招呼出來，或是打發到霧裏去，使大家確信，這大城市的末日還沒有到來，汽車向房屋的門户，和滿是燈光和乾燥的暖氣的店舖駛過去，從那些汽車走下不是太挺就是太胖的戴着高帽子的紳士們來。紳士們殷勤地，蠻橫地將自已的臂膀向他們高貴的太太們獻過去。女人們，並不全然剌耳地笑着二着：那瓷器玩偶似的臉龐上一副瞧不起什麽的眉眼，他們將玲瓏的兩脚觸到潮潤的柏油路上去。店舖呑了他們，好像老　呑了壯蠣一樣。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>求生敎育</h3>
<p>— 明堂</p>
<p>據報載，魯敎育廳長何思源近年來勵行「求生敎育」，積極擴充職業學校，其目的，在使學生畢業後有謀生技能，使農村子弟不變更其生活環境，以打倒所謂士大夫敎育云。這倒是一椿很有意思的事情。</p>
<p>士大夫敎育，確實非打倒不可。求生敎育，是應該極力推廣的。然而我們却不能不有個疑問，單是積極推行求生敎育，高喊打倒士大夫敎育，學生畢業後，是否就能個個得到很好的職業，而不致求生無所呢？這倒是一個很可商量的問題。</p>
<p>士大夫敎育之形成，原不在什麽以前並不推行求生敎育，而是在這社會根本不允許人們求生，這話怎講？那末我們看罷：現社會那一處是允許我們去求生的？農村是破產，都市是感覺人口過剩，一切產業，一切經濟生活，都跌落到異常悲慘衰落的地位。在這樣一個環境下，求生敎育有什麽用，雖要求生，又向何處去求生呢？所以，這是一個社會的根本問題，而不是什麽區區一個求生敎育所能解决得了的。社會根本問題不解决，任是怎樣積極推行求生敎育，恐怕結果還是徒然。事實已給我們證明了，近年政府雖竭力禁止大學文法諸科之增設，竭力取締文法科學生，奬勵工科等學生，而結果讀文法科的學生還是相對地多。這就是說明單從敎育着手是沒有用的，而必須從社會根本着手，才能奏效。敎育原不過是整個社會上層建築之一，不改變社會根本制度，這上層建築，簡直是無法零碎改造的。一向主張以敎育救國的人們，一向主張提倡職業敎育的人們，這意見以爲怎樣？</p>
<p>積極勵行求生敎育，至少有一個前提，就是先要使得學生畢業後能够求生。如學工的，畢業後至少要能給他工做。學農的，畢業後至少要能給他農事做，乃至其他種種，都莫不應該如是。這樣推行求生敎育，才能有成功的希望，而且也只有這樣的推行求生敎育，才算是眞的求生敎育。不然，單從空虚的敎育下手，結果恐怕都會是一無所用。</p>
<h3>兩伙伴</h3>
<p>— 工田</p>
<p>松花江旁的浪聲，確是含有無限的詩意。猶其是在静静的夜裏，當和風盪動着披紋，泛起了閃閃的月光。：：：她在日裏爲人們攪得倦了，趁着人們睡熟的當兒，恨命的喘幾口氣：嘩！嘩！撞上岸去。魚兒們多麽安心呀！他們已睡熟了。他們不願看那在雲彩裏掙扎不出的月兒了。</p>
<p>江橋死一般的呆立在那裏，似乎這未來的事情，不知在那兒爆發！仍是被兩條拖長的軌道壓着。惟有那水時時嘩！嘩！撞擊它。似警告它這未來的事情的恐怖！守橋的兩個老兵這時也不打盹了。静候着命令持着槍向遠處發呆。同時又增了兩個日本兵。他們未發話，都静默着預備這未來的事件。這時砲台中的燈火也暗下了。沉静着還聽見那神秘的水聲。</p>
<p>入他娘的！臨到咱們的班子。偏偏就有了事情。</p>
<p>！１誰不說呢，老牛！若是有了事</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>情，我們就向後轉啊！</p>
<p>兩個日本兵早已戴好了鐵帽，亮爍爍的剌刀伸了出來！好不威風，望了他們一眼，呵！：：的冷笑了幾聲。先說話的老牛像氣不過似的瞪了他們一眼，接着說了一聲「媽的！」</p>
<p>」的！的！「兩聲警笛之後，他們各自臥下伏在道木上，把槍伸了出去！各人的面色分外的蒼白與機警。「砰！砰！：：」日本兵開槍了！他們仍是静着。只有老六不時偷看着他們使的傢伙。　「殺呀！殺呀！」喊聲槍聲打成一片。一堆堆的人們自動的集在一起，他們手中持着火槍，木棒，大刀，火把：：：喊着口號向砲台衝來。頓時這静寂的夜裏充滿了殺聲喊聲槍聲，老牛和老六很快的跳下道木去，躱在橋柱上。那邊開槍射擊了！砰！砰！：：</p>
<p>「轟！轟」接着前面的一些人便壯烈的被砲火殘殺了。但是他們仍是不退一步的。仍是進攻着，並且聲勢更大了　「砰！砰！：：」槍聲不停的射着。　　！！老六！先把這兩個送他家去吧！說完老六點點頭便砰！砰！砰！：：同時的向他們射去，兩個便墜入江中了，不久江水又恢復了平静。一點痕跡也沒有，似乎沒有這麽一回事。老牛哈！哈！的笑了。用力的推了老六一下。　！！眞痛快呀！老六喊着也笑了。　「轟！轟！」砲聲又響了，又是一排人犧牲了！在火把映照着：黑暗的大地閃出了紅光。那血水中堆滿了屍體　　後一排又呐喊着衝了上去！</p>
<p>「嗚！嗚！：；」飛機！飛機！他們同聲的喊着臥下去了，他們都散開葡匐的進攻着，嘴裏不住的喊着「殺呀！殺呀！殺上去呀！」</p>
<p>！！老六！我們「一不作二不休」他媽的「滿洲國」你看那邊躺在血水中的屍體不都是我們中國人嗎！我們快佔砲台吧！顯然老牛的臉變色了，他一口氣說完了這些話，便扯着老六的袖子爬上了道木向砲台跑去了！</p>
<p>「打死日本人啊！」他倆同聲喊着，在砲火中攻進了砲台。」</p>
<p>「砰！砰！：：」他們開槍了，老牛向裏面攻了進去，瞬時內部的燈火全滅了！這時他們的心震顫得厲害，但還是在搜尋他們的敵人！老六摸上了二層，不防被日兵砰！砰！二槍打死了！同時老牛也中了一彈！他們就這樣的死了。　「殺呀！：：」這聲多麽近呀！就在砲台的外邊！守砲台的日兵都嚇躱了。他們攻上來了！他們完全得勝了！但是他們同時都受了重傷，在黑暗中他們把「紅藍白黑黃」的旗子撕毁！換上了靑天白日！旗在黑暗中擺了幾擺！他們都露着勝利微笑的光彩！倒死在「靑天白日」之下。</p>
<h3>浪人</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>他不願回憶過去，他也不敢預思將來；他彷彿覺着過去和將來都含有猛烈的　　會醉傷他的浪漫的現實　　　　　　他時當說着　樣自慰的語調：</p>
<p>沒有女人，我沒有名譽，我沒有事業，我沒有金錢啊！我沒有一切的一切，來繞纏我的身心，剝奪我的自由：我正可在這短促的旅途上，放浪，遊蕩，」　他抱着濃厚的現樂主義，遇着無覊的浪漫生活，他從來不曉得顧念生活的保障，他唯一的人生觀就是「今日有酒今日醉」。</p>
<p>他也受過飢餓的困迫，寒冷的威逼可是這種生活上的微波，終不能影響到他的整個人生觀。</p>
<p>春夜！美麗的春夜！展着溫柔的微笑，偷偷地降臨到人間來了。</p>
<p>他在齷齪的枕下，摸出了日裏從Ｘ書局領來的稿費，穿了漏底皮鞋，戴上油膩的舊呢帽，踏着得意的步伐，向繁華的上海進攻。</p>
<p>他逛過淸凉的公園，和燈紅酒綠的舞廳，啊！那些樹陰下在甜密密接吻的情侣，和　滑地板上擁抱着在狂舞的男</p>
<p>女，都使他嫉妒，咀咒。</p>
<p>啊！啊！上海！萬惡的上海！處處都有愛情交易所的開設。那里找不到性和肉的安慰呢？</p>
<p>他摸着袴袋里由腦汁換來的銀餅，開始找尋肉的沉迷。</p>
<p>静寂的馬路上，暗淡的，疎疎的，幾盞燈光下，正陳列着大批的肉，等候主顧們惠臨。她們穿着緋紅深綠，各色樣的鮮麗衣服，面上也塗着厚厚的白粉，紅紅胭脂，流滑的秋波，也同樣地在媚着過路的顧客。她們那一處及不到公園里的，跳舞廳里的呢？</p>
<p>啊！這是出賣肉的在招呼顧客嗎？她們爲什麽要將自已的肉出買呢？她們所換到的是什麽？啊！麫包！是糊口的麫包！」他這樣的在暗自忖度着，同時也想起了公園裏的，舞塲裏的，她們供人們撫摩，擁抱，：：爲什麽呢？無非也是爲麫包吧！</p>
<p>他不嫉妒也不咀咒了。他摸着袴袋里的銀餅，像公園里和舞塲里的人們一　　看他們跨進了一條又　又　的弄　裏。去嘗試他所謂人生第一次的「新　后」。</p>
<p>東方微微透出了魚白色，春風軟軟地向人們吹着。</p>
<p>他經過一夜浪漫的生活，化去袴袋里腦汁的代價；迷糊地從又髒又狹的弄衕里出來。可是，他忽然想起可怕的將來，他不能這樣自暴自棄，他還年靑着哩！在歸途上，他把皮鞋踏得怪響，似乎在讉責着自已的心。</p>
<h3>危險</h3>
<p>— 三多</p>
<p>「馬路如虎口，當中不可走！」上海到處是危險，生命常常懸在生死關頭。今天出門，是否能帶命回來，每個人不能預料。雖說在虎口上送掉命的，都是初到上海的鄉曲，但是有的是太老上海了，很大意的把命送進虎口；而且法大馬路的招牌會打破你的頭顱，抛球塲的洋房會把你壓成肉醬，再留心點，電綫從半空中吊下來，莫明其妙的槍聲四起，人倒底沒具蝙螎的才能，老太太說，命裏註定，是無可避免的！於是大家想坐汽車，橫衝直撞，他人的命在我車身下滾過可以不干我的事，但是汽車新聞中，那個命不見得是保險馬甲。</p>
<p>時至今日，把命更送得稀奇了，不聞浦驚鴻燙髮送命乎？現在有獨無偶，電氣燙髮也開了新記錄。雖祗有某報刋了一條沒有確定的新聞，但我已探聽得是事實無疑。本來有人說過笑話，剪髮是最危險的事，如其理髮匠是我的怨家，他亮幌幌的剃刀祇要輕輕地在我𩓐子上一�</p>
<p>抹，已足送一命而有餘；何况把血肉之軀的頭顱，套到那個架子裏去，再上十五分鐘的電刑，頭髮像丫鵲窠般堆在頭上有什麽美觀呢？一條命付了五塊錢代價送去確是洋盤之至。</p>
<p>今天我家門前在修馬路，兩旁架子上都寫着「危險」，一盞紅燈被風吹着掏洩，心中好像喘喘然不安起來。</p>
<h3>燙髮與纏足</h3>
<p>— 炯女士</p>
<p>因襲的傳統觀念緊繫着每個人的心，而封建思想，還沒有達到根本破壞的現有制度，大部份事業的進展，都只表現在沿革過往抄襲舊有的狀態下，所以婦女的燙髮和纏足，其痛苦并沒有兩樣，同一的是在不健全的制度下面，表現着自已的愚笨！以及戕害自身的健康和幸福。</p>
<p>在前些年代，婦女在深深的封建勢力摧殘之下，根本沒有所謂解放，而自已本身，亦不知道所謂解放，只是整天的做着玩弄品，處在被支配的地獄裏過活罷了。爲着要使得自已得到男人們的歡心，不得不想盡了幾許方法，忍受着自已的痛苦，而給男人們的喜悅和欣賞　所以婦女的纏足，就隨着要得男人們的歡心這個條件而來了。在那時候，我們只聽得倒處的哀聲；父母爲着爭門面，也只好忍受着女兒的痛苦，還是緊緊的將一雙天然的，健康的足纏起來。而女兒本身，唯恐將來因爲得不到一個男人的歡喜，和鄰家的訕笑。雖然自已已是感到欲絕的痛苦，但鐵一般的封建思想，如鐐銬似的鎖住了她們的身和心，而終是無可奈何的事啊！</p>
<p>殆至歐風東漸，婦女解放的呼聲，才慢慢的隨着這風流而響應起來，因此，一般舊有的陳腐的思想，亦被這時代的猛進而粉碎！這纏足的痛苦，也就一天天的减少了。</p>
<p>雖然，新的花樣，仍舊層出不窮的</p>
<p>來壓迫了婦女解放的前途，代替了舊有的婦女的纏足那種痛苦而與其遙遙相對的。便是如今盛行一時的燙髮，纏足是下部的痛苦，而影響到全身的發育和身體的健康，而燙髮又何常不是一樣，剌激的腦子昏昏，有的因爲普通的燙髮，而燒得週身發泡，皮膚紅腫，更有因燙髮而喪命者，如前年轟動一時的浦驚鴻女士，我們就知送在這婦女解放的呼聲，高響入雲的年代，在實際上而婦女所受的痛苦，又何嘗减輕了幾許？同是戕害了身體的健康和發育，總之，婦女的燙髮與纏足所受的痛苦，可以說是同在一個命運的圈套中打滾，！給男人們的喜悅和欣賞罷了！因此，要想永遠的，澈底的解開了這種圈套，就非要婦女們把那傳統的思想打的粉碎，眞實的努力，從事業的建立上去求解放不可。</p>
<h3>千金</h3>
<p>— 穆琳</p>
<p>黃公館裏今天像發生了什麽大事般的忙亂起來，除了車夫和廚子不安定地在客廳中抽烟之外，一切人等，都在樓上手忙脚亂，電話已打了兩次，可是那個他們急急乎需要的救星還是沒有來。黃媽被老爺一頓沒頭沒腦的訓斥之後，像是應該似的提了蹄子樣的小脚衝下樓去，瞧見兩個在抽着烟捲不覺也提起無名火來。</p>
<p>「醫生怎沒有來呢？」像老爺一樣的駡起人來。</p>
<p>「我們正等着哩！」兩個也像應該似的小心着回答。</p>
<p>「老爺急得要命呢，到弄口去看看，别找錯了門牌！」</p>
<p>突然電鈴響起來，三個人彷彿比賽似的跑去開門。門外一個是他們認識的醫生，二個穿白衣的女人，手裏都提着皮包。不及來客啓問，黃媽拉了醫生的手一邊走邊說：</p>
<p>「姨太太已　過去二次，老爺急得什麽似的，王醫生快跟我上去。」</p>
<p>樓梯口老爺雙手筒在衣袖裏，見醫生上來連連打躬說；「王醫生勞駕了，快裏面請。」忙閃開了身體讓三位醫生到裏房去。</p>
<p>王醫生有把握地點了一下頭，推了裏房的門進去，一陣像被什麽東西壓迫着似的女人的慘呌從裏面送出來，老爺不自覺的連連頓着脚想伸過頭去張望一眼，却被黃媽背手把門關上了？裏面祗聽見輕微的哼着及幾個人忙股的脚聲，老爺無可奈何來回地在樓梯口踱着方步　心裏雖是着急，可是一個希望却把他從悲哀中拉回來，脚步不由地停了，心中忖着；「要是生了個男孩子，我可以自由自然的住在這裏了，太太不是說過嗎。討姨太太保生兒子就由你討去：</p>
<p>」想到這裏，笑嘻嘻的又踱起步來。</p>
<p>忽然樓梯口發現了兩個人頭，把老爺嚇了一大跳，是車夫阿福和廚子李興躡手躡脚的跑上來。</p>
<p>「鬼頭鬼腦做什麽？」老爺的希望被他們嚇跑了，自然沒有好氣地的駡起來　「太太太平了？」兩個細聲地問。</p>
<p>老爺沒有回答，裏面又是一聲慘呌，幾個人吱吱喳喳的擾起來，老爺心裏明白，探頭到房門口，像一個宣判的囚犯一樣：心吊在老遠的米空中，踮起了脚跟，將自已的耳朶貼到上門上去，阿福和李興也把整個身體露在樓梯之上，張大了嘴，希望一些他們其實是和他們無關　　的希望。</p>
<p>裏面的聲音稍稍停止之後，黃媽探頭探腦的　來了，老爺的面孔突然變得那樣嚴肅，他的視綫像有轉灣抹角的本領般的向房內亂投。黃媽是那般的露着笑臉，蹄子脚也輕輕的不敢放重，說：　　「恭喜老爺，一位千金！」</p>
<p>老爺黃金的希望打破了，他以爲黃媽的話是說錯了，「女的？」其實老爺的說話沒有出聲，但是黃媽從他的表情上知道了意思，「是的，老爺，一位千金。」回答後又跑進房裏去了。</p>
<p>老爺的身體似乎往下沉，他覺得一種喘不過氣來的壓迫，他也想那末的慘呌一聲，旋過頭來見阿福李興還矗在樓梯口，彷彿找着了對象頓脚的駡；</p>
<p>「還不替我快些滾下去！」</p>
<h3>拉雜語</h3>
<p>— 淘飾</p>
<p>▲現在各式各樣的面孔，若各人回頭把過去的情形一想，必定都換上一付樣子，</p>
<p>▲滿口有福共享有難共當，一到利害關頭，此語便成例外，</p>
<p>▲肉感，大腿，屁股，夜夜抱了舞女瘋癲似的狂吻，天明着上藍布長衫，大談其節儉生活，</p>
<p>▲穿上舶來品的時髦西裝，踏到演說臺上，便滿口提倡國貨，</p>
<p>滿腔熱心愛國，</p>
<p>▲天天捉住小孩毒打，但不許他哭呌一聲，說是棒頭上出孝子</p>
<p>▲踏上饑餓綫的路上，做「趕猪羅」的生涯，晚上回去，在妻拏面前還大搭其架子，</p>
<p>▲他的老婆和人家租了小房子還說賢母良妻，世間少有</p>

<h3>節母坊（十）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>割稻子的時期，在農村照例是很忙的。正輔公公家裏，雖然是世代書香，可是本坂的二十幾畝田，到底還得雇長工耕種，所以三天以來，每天是四五個人下田，不說别的，就是忙着燒飯也够累人了。一會兒吃過午飯，長工們都照例的睡午覺去了，姑媽雖然是周圍三十里數一數二的美麗姑娘，不管她還有才女之稱，可是當這三伏熱天，忙着晒榖子，還是她個人最主要的責任。幸虧灰雞婆也偷空來帮帮忙，不然她簡直沒有方法對付。祗有時敏是什麽也不做。因爲早晨起來太早，現在也静静的躺在走廓下的竹床上睡着了，旁邊坐着母親在給他揮着蒲扇。</p>
<p>大熱天的午後，沒有一點兒風，連階前的樹葉子都給悶窒着不敢擺動一下。悶熱，像大火在地底下蒸發着。一隻老雄狗，披着一身厚而重的灰色的毛，藏匿在花壇的蔭影處躺，伸出舌頭在拚命的呼吸。静悄悄的，一切都悶窒着沒有聲響連簷前的麻雀，也不肯偶然的呌一聲。祗有姑媽在稻塲中木棍劃着竹簞的聲音，單調的在撕破這死一般的寂寞。她也覺得軟酥酥的要睡去似的。　不久，她看見姑媽自稻塲上回來。她一面解下她的印花布頭巾，一面從嫂嫂手裏搶過蒲扇不住的搖着，到底是年靑靑的姑娘，又是讀書人家的閨秀，不</p>
<p>肯輕易解開衣襟冷一冷汗，豆大的汗滴，從前額流到鼻子，再滴在地下。嫂嫂說：</p>
<p>「你爲什麽不穿那件夏布褂子呢？可憐熱得這樣的。」</p>
<p>「誰高興穿夏布褂子，像什麽，肉也給人家看見的。」</p>
<p>「那又什麽要緊呢？反正在家裏穿穿，又沒有客人來。」</p>
<p>「我不要穿，熱死了我也不穿，怪難爲情的。」</p>
<p>嫂嫂是微笑着，不再說什麽。一會兒姑媽到房裏洗臉去了，嫂嫂再接過蒲扇給兒子打扇，他那圓圓闊的額角也吐着幾點汗珠。於是她用自已的衫袖替他揩乾了汗，可是他却幾乎給驚醒了，翻動着，又朝裏面睡去。他那赤膊的手膊上給竹床印成一條一條紅色的瘢痕。又一會兒，輝雞婆肩着扁擔，從走廓邊走過，又預備到坂上去，當他看見時敏在睡覺，立刻裂開嘴嘻笑着，他似乎是在對自已說着：</p>
<p>「哼，這個孩子，在牌坊園裏敎别的小孩給他敲牌坊上的菩薩頭下來玩裏眞是：：」</p>

<h3>Yin Tong, Chai Shan, etc. Negotiate Train Through Traffic in Tianjin; Newspaper Reporters Chase After Yin Tong; Commander Yin Drives in Circles; Formal Discussions Temporarily Postponed; Chai Shan Denies Any Meeting</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) This year, at 11:30 AM, Chai Shan arrived in Tianjin from Peiping. Yin Tong sent a car to pick him up and take him to the reception center at No. 36 Beining Road in the French Concession. He met with Chen Xiangtao, Zhou Shizhong, and others for informal consultations on the train through traffic procedures. They then had a simple meal at the same location. The original plan was to begin discussions at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, but Yin Tong was busy attending Yu Xuezhong's banquet welcoming Kong Xiangxi, so the meeting was temporarily postponed, awaiting Yin Rugeng's arrival. Today, at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, when Kong left Tianjin, Yin Tong boarded a special train. Tianjin newspaper reporters, seeking Yin Tong's account of the negotiation process, followed Yin's car in an automobile from Tianjin Main Station this afternoon, through the French and British Concessions. Yin ordered the driver to step on the gas and drive in large circles, eventually disappearing into a friend's residence. Afterwards, reporters from various newspapers searched for Yin's whereabouts in various locations, but Yin had already instructed the gatekeepers to refuse all communications. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A reporter visited Chai Shan at the Tokiwa Hotel. Chai Shan said that he could not announce the confirmed date for through traffic, but that it had already been discussed and agreed upon by both sides. There was no meeting being convened in Tianjin, and all outside rumors were mere speculation. He would stay in Tianjin for two or three days before returning to Peiping. He had seen Chen Xiangtao and Yin Tong today, but was unable to discuss matters in detail with Director Yin because he was attending the welcoming banquet for Minister Kong. The matters of Gubeikou and Caojialu have been resolved. The number of special police in the newly established war zone will be determined by Chairman Kao Xien. Once Kao Xien makes a decision, they can enter the war zone. All problems will be completely resolved once through traffic is implemented. Chai Shan strongly denied that representatives from the South Manchuria Railway had come to Tianjin, saying that only he himself had come. Yin Rugeng's ship, the "Xinming", could not arrive in Tianjin until the morning of the 25th due to the shallow waters at Dagu Port. Today's meeting on through traffic was postponed to the morning of the 25th because Yin Tong was busy with social engagements and Yin Rugeng had not arrived. However, the location is unknown, as it is rumored that both sides will change the meeting place to the Beining Reception Center in order to avoid newspaper reporters. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Chai Shan went to Tianjin this morning with five Japanese railway technicians. In addition to attending the preparatory meeting for through traffic, he will also meet with Tao Shangming and Yin Rugeng, together with Yin Tong, to discuss the points that the Japanese side should fulfill in the war zone. Yin is scheduled to go to Tianjin tonight. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The technical meeting on through traffic began in Tianjin today.

The issue of the withdrawal of Japanese troops along the Great Wall and the transfer of administrative powers at various ports will be handled by Huang upon his arrival in the north for overall negotiations, which will begin after Huang arrives in Peiping. According to recent Shanghai telegrams, Huang is expected to return to Peiping in early July. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mutiny of Puppet Troops Outside Malanyu</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Wei Mingding unit of the puppet troops stationed outside Malanyu near the Qing Tombs suddenly mutinied on the 21st because they could not bear the abuse of the Japanese instructors. Two cavalry companies fled with their weapons in all directions. The Japanese military dispatched several aircraft to search, and it has been confirmed that they are entrenched in a village eighty miles east of Malanyu. Zhang Junzhe's unit of puppet troops dispatched a large cavalry detachment to surround them. A large number of puppet troops have recently been deployed to the area around Saheqiao and Dongling, occupying civilian farmland as training grounds and using heavy trucks to transport large quantities of military supplies.

The puppet government was formerly located in Ruijin.

<h3>Third Fleet's Air Squadron Flies to Lijin to Assist in Bandit Suppression; Cruiser Chuyu Also Sails to Blockade; Han and Xie Plan Joint Sea-Land Defense</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) The Third Fleet's air squadron dispatched aircraft Nos. 183 and 185, piloted by squadron leaders Xu and Huang, from Lijin to the mouth of the Yellow River on the morning of the 24th to assist the army and navy in suppressing the bandits of the Shuntianlun steamship. The cruiser Chuyu also sailed to strictly blockade the area on the morning of the 24th. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han, regarding the Shuntianlun steamship robbery, entrusted an Englishman to send a letter to Yu, asking for leniency. Because it has not yet been received, the troops are still surrounding the bandits in Lijin Laohekou and have not launched an attack. Regarding the salt robbery in Weihai, Minister Kong discussed the matter during his visit to Jinan. If there are no instigators, a way can be found to sympathize with the people. If there are instigators, they will be severely punished. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Xie Gangzhe visited Han in Jinan today and immediately returned to Qingdao. Han saw him off at the station. Xie said that he was very anxious about the Shuntianlun steamship case after hearing about it in Nanjing and was ashamed to see Chiang. Chiang consoled him, and Chiang missed Han very much, instructing Xie to substitute for him. According to reports, the bandits originally numbered eighty or ninety. From the 8th to the 12th of last month, the Yongxiang warship was dispatched to suppress them, killing the bandit leader Hao San and causing the rest to flee to Tianjin. Therefore, they boarded the ship in Tianjin to commit the robbery, originally forcing it to sail to Yingkou. The ship's Third Officer Ross refused and was injured, so they changed course to the mouth of the Yellow River. If they had sailed to Yingkou, it would have been even more troublesome. The bandits are currently in the Taoer River area, where the reeds are deep and the water is shallow, so warships cannot enter. Therefore, only sampans and aircraft can be used to search and suppress them. The warships Tong'an, Zhenhai, Hai'ou, and Haihe are surrounding the area. Han said that he had just planned a joint sea-land defense with Commander Xie. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Constant Fluctuations in Sino-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, talk of a Russo-Japanese war has been endless. However, the situation has been one of waxing and waning, and has not yet erupted. The most intriguing thing is that Japan's attitude toward Russia has gradually softened, and is not as strong as in the past. When the Japanese arrested Soviet Russian personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway, they were full of arrogance, as if Soviet Russia had to immediately show submission. When the United States and Russia resumed diplomatic relations, the situation suddenly changed. The Japanese side seized the opportunity to change course and released the arrested Soviet Russian personnel. As for the most recent incidents, the Soviet Russian detention of Japanese fishing boats and the shelling of Japanese ships photographing on the Russian border, Japan dealt with them without any resolution and did not file a strong protest. On the contrary, the attitude on the Soviet Russian side has become tougher. Anti-Japanese propaganda by responsible officials in Moscow has repeatedly appeared in newspapers. They are unwilling to let the sale and purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway be done at will. In addition, they are dealing with all disputes between the Japanese and the puppet regime with a completely uncompromised attitude. Their intention to prepare to deal with Japan is clearly visible. If the Japanese really wanted to go to war with Russia, they could use these situations as an excuse, so why do they pretend to be deaf and mute and act calm? With a little scrutiny, we know that the change in the Japanese attitude has its own deep meaning.</p>
<p>The most obvious is that the Soviet Russia's defense forces in the Far East have become unusually strong, and its diplomatic relations with capitalist countries are far better than before. Recently, the double track of the Siberian Railway has been completed, and the number of immigrants from the west has doubled compared to the past. In addition, the Soviet Russia's second five-year plan has been successfully completed, and its national power has increased, which goes without saying. At this time, if Japan rashly goes to war with Russia, the Japanese may not dare to be confident of victory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Russo-Japanese War will be decided in the air. The Soviet Russian Air Force currently has 3,000 aircraft, which Japan cannot compare with. If a war breaks out, Japan's cities will be within the range of Soviet Russian aircraft, and most of the houses of its people are made of paper and wood, which are easy to burn. Once the Russo-Japanese War starts, Russian aircraft will swarm in, and Japanese cities will be in danger of being bombed first. Therefore, Japan must expand its air force to a position where it is not afraid before it can be sure of winning the war. It is because of this that Japan does not dare to rashly go to war with Russia. According to recent Tokyo dispatches, Japan has decided to expand aircraft manufacturing plants and prepare to expand its air force on a large scale, which shows that the Japanese government is well aware that its air force cannot match Soviet Russia's. From this, we can deduce that the softening of Japan's attitude towards Russia is not enough to prove the improvement of Russo-Japanese relations. However, the Japanese have always been considered wise. Unless there is a drastic change in the European and American situation, and after they have the confidence to rely on their own strength, they will not recklessly attack Russia. On the other hand, if Soviet Russia believes that the time for war has come and wants to launch it, Japan will inevitably rise up to meet the challenge. Therefore, the key to a second Russo-Japanese War in the future depends on the extent of Soviet Russian provocation.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi and His Entourage Passed Through Tianjin and Arrived in Peiping Yesterday; Yu Xuezhong Boarded the Train From Ze and Traveled Together; He Yingqin Held a Banquet That Evening</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Kong Xiangxi and his wife, four sons and daughters, and more than twenty staff members arrived in Peiping at 4:30 PM today. Yu Xuezhong, Wei Jian, Han Linsheng, Ning Encheng, Ding Chungao, and Lu Muting boarded the train in Tianjin and traveled together. There were many welcome slogans at the Peiping train station. Those who came to the station to welcome them included He Yingqin, He Qigong, Zhang Lisheng, Yuan Liang, Cai Yuan, Yu Jinhe, Jiang Menglin, Wang Zensi, Qi Dapeng, and more than 500 representatives from all walks of life. The Public Security Bureau also sent a security band to the station for security and welcome. After Kong got off the train, he went to Fengze Garden in Zhongnanhai to rest. He Yingqin, Yuan Liang, and others went to visit him. That evening, He hosted a banquet for Kong and his entourage at Chun'ouzhai in Jurentang. Yu Xuezhong, Shang Zhen, Wan Fulin, Wang Shuchang, Yuan Liang, and others were invited to accompany them. Kong is scheduled to attend the Yenching University graduation ceremony tomorrow morning. After staying in Peiping for a few days, he will go to Shanxi to attend the Mingxian Middle School graduation ceremony and meet with Yan. After staying for a short time, he will return to Beijing via the Peiping-Hankou Railway and inspect it for about three weeks. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Kong Xiangxi said that this trip was purely for inspection purposes. Before the financial conference, he had inspected Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces. Now that the financial conference has concluded and various resolutions have been passed, they will be implemented separately. Therefore, he needs to conduct practical inspections of salt tax, customs duties, unified tax, and local conditions. At the same time, because he also serves as the Governor of the Central Bank and the Chairman of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee, it is also necessary to inspect the facilities of branch offices and the situation of river works. In terms of education, he serves as the chairman of the board of directors of Yenching University and China College, and Mingxian School was founded by him. Therefore, he came in person to attend the graduation ceremony. He plans to stay in Peiping for a few days and then return to his native Shanxi. After staying for a short time, he will return south via the Peiping-Hankou Railway. Because he has already met Zhuan and Song will come to Peiping tomorrow, the trip to Chahar and Suiyuan has been canceled. The various professional talents who came with him will be assigned to various places for practical inspections. The establishment of checkpoints at various passes of the Great Wall has been prepared long ago and will be under the jurisdiction of the customs in the future. Because the conditions in each province are different, the various cases of the financial conference will be implemented separately. He hopes that each province can make an overall plan. China's collection of donations and taxes has always lacked scientific methods. The overlapping and harsh levies of provinces, cities, counties, and townships have led to rural bankruptcy because the people have not gained as much as they have lost. The current priority is to enable people to live and work in peace and cooperation between officials and the people to overcome difficulties. After abolishing the harsh and miscellaneous levies, the relief measures will be determined according to the conditions in various places. China's illness lies in the large number of troops, and neither local nor central finances have a solution. In the future, the tobacco, alcohol, and stamp taxes will be transferred to the local governments. The organization will strive to reduce the size, and the stamp tax stamps will be handled by the post office. The inspection duties will be handled by the local police, and the stamp tax bureau will be abolished. The Ministry of Finance will send additional inspectors to various places to investigate. He received a telegram from Yan in Beijing, stating that Yan's illness has gradually improved and that he still needs to rest. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, and Guo Zhihan, the Director of the Chahar Department of Finance, telegraphed the 29th Army Office today because Kong arrived in Peiping, saying that they were scheduled to depart from Zhangjiakou on the morning of the 25th and arrive in Peiping at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Zhang Jianhou, the head of the office, reported to Kong after receiving the telegram. In addition to reporting the difficult financial situation in Chahar Province, Song and others will discuss the elimination of harsh and miscellaneous taxes and the compensation measures in a comprehensive manner. They will also report in detail the disaster situation in Chahar Province over the years to seek relief. Su Tiren, the Director of the Suiyuan Department of Finance, will also rush to Peiping tonight to visit Kong and report on the financial situation in Suiyuan Province. Kong had already met with Fu Zuoyi, the Chairman of Suiyuan, in Beijing and understood the financial situation in Suiyuan Province. Because Song will arrive in Peiping soon, the trip to Chahar and Suiyuan has been canceled. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

Kong went to the Central Bank to rest after getting off the train. He told reporters that he would stay in Peiping for three days and planned to take a trip to Chahar and Suiyuan. However, he had just received a telegram from Chairman Song Mingxuan welcoming him and saying that he would wait for him in Peiping. Therefore, if time does not permit, he will not go. The central government is very concerned about the situation in the Hebei war zone. He wants to know whether there are any difficulties in the various provinces and how the war zone is, so he is making preparations for implementation by touring the north this time. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

Kong promised to submit it to the ministry for review when he returns to Beijing. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Yu Xuezhong arrived in Peiping from Tianjin with Kong Xiangxi at 5:00 PM on the 24th. Yu said that he greatly agreed with the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes. However, the aftermath problem can only be handled well if the central government makes proper arrangements. His trip to Peiping this time is to discuss the aftermath problem with Minister Kong. The unfinished business of the war zone can be resolved in order after Chairman Huang returns to Peiping. A total of twelve principal offenders in the Yin Henry case have been arrested, and one, Hou Wenming, has been captured. The rest are still being pursued. Yu is scheduled to return to Tianjin in one or two days. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Otherwise, once discovered, the military and police agencies will impose joint and several punishments. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>An Inspection of the Situation in Eastern Chahar</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) An inspector sent by a certain agency to inspect Eastern Chahar stated that after Duolun and Guyuan were occupied by the Japanese, there are now over a hundred troops of the puppet army under Li Shouxin stationed there. The Japanese 7th Division and Li Shouxin's troops are stationed in Duolun. Sixty Japanese soldiers are stationed in Xinyuan Yida Camp. Several Japanese aircraft are parked at the Xinyuan airfield. There is a Catholic church in Pingding Fort, 25 li north of Guyuan. Puppet soldiers often go there to shop. The uniforms of the puppet soldiers are the same as those of the Japanese army. The military road in western Rehe has been completed to Heidazi Camp, which is about 70 li from Miyun and 60 li from Si Hai in Changqing. Guyuan and Chicheng have always been extremely impoverished. Tang Yulin's troops are entrenched in various places, causing endless disturbances, and competing with Liu Guitang, causing severe damage to the people. When we arrived in Chicheng, all the shops in the city were closed, with only two floating stalls. Salt was long gone. The houses in Chicheng and Guyuan have been occupied by soldiers and bandits, and the roofs, doors, and windows have been dismantled and used as fuel. The entire family has only enough clothes for one or two people to cover their bodies. The East Main Street of Yunzhou has now become rubble and scorched earth. Guyuan County has lost 150,000 cattle and 500,000 sheep. The disaster situation in Baochang and Kangbao is relatively lighter. The cries of the distressed are everywhere, and relief is urgently needed. Bandits in Eastern Chahar appear and disappear unpredictably. A folk song in the area between Shacheng and Dushikou goes: "First fear Chang'an Ridge, second fear Diao'e Gulch, third fear Chicheng to Yunzhou." These three places are the lairs of bandits. Recently, the garrison troops have been suppressing them and have almost cleared them out. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Fan Xiji's Talk in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Fan Xiji, Director of the Hubei Security Department, said that last month on the 29th, he went from Hubei to Jiangxi to attend the Military and Political Leaders Conference, and then went to Wuyuan to meet with Commander Chen Diaoyuan. Afterwards, he went to Hangzhou to inspect the coastal defense construction. This time, he took the opportunity to meet with President Wang and Chairman Chiang. The banditry in the eastern and western counties of Hubei has been successively suppressed. Hubei Province has always had financial difficulties, but fortunately, by cutting expenses everywhere and receiving monthly allocations from the Central Government, the income and expenditure are barely balanced. The Hubei Security Department directly controls four regiments, with the same organization as the army. In the past, there were 500 security squads in the counties of the province, with a total of about 50,000 people. In order to reduce the burden on the people, he has successively reduced them, and now there are still 300 squads, with about 30,000 people. The salaries of the security squads are allocated by local gentry. Fan Xiji went to Wuhu on the 24th to transfer to Hubei. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Soviet Aviation Department Reorganized, Focusing on Expanding the Air Force, Japan Feels Threatened</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government has reorganized the Aviation Department to implement a large-scale plan to unify the aviation industry. Twelve aviation bureaus have been established throughout the country to manage all air transportation. The heads of the local aviation bureaus are all subordinate to the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Department, and the Central Aviation Department is further divided into fifteen sections, each responsible for construction, repair, design, and other matters. A political section will also be established. (23rd Guomin Telegram)</p>
<p>▲Moscow reports that the Soviet authorities are determined to expand their air force. The number of aircraft in the country now exceeds 3,000. In terms of quantity, it can be called the first except for France. The increase in numbers in recent years is listed as follows:</p>
<p>January 1931: Approximately 1,500</p>
<p>January 1932: Approximately 1,600</p>
<p>January 1933: Approximately 2,200</p>
<p>October 1933: Approximately 2,500</p>
<p>January 1934: Approximately 3,000</p>
<p>The number of Soviet aircraft concentrated in the Far East, surrounding North Manchuria, is approximately 400. Among them, dozens of new-style super-heavy bombers are concentrated in the Primorsky Krai, with a carrying capacity of 3.4 to 5 tons and a range of 2,000 to 2,500. Assuming that the area near Vladivostok is the base for air raids, then Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and the Kanmon Straits are all within 1,100. Therefore, the central part of Japan, as assessed by the German press, will fall into a terrifying air raid circle. In addition to the above-mentioned concentration in the Far East, the Soviet Union also has approximately 150 of its newest elite aircraft gathered near Moscow, which can reach the front line in the Far East in just two or three days in case of an emergency.

<h3>Germany and Russia Unable to Approach, European Crisis Lurks, Ten Newspapers Discuss the Resignation of Envoys, Believing That the Work of Improving Relations Is Hopeless</h3>
<p>Istanbul: The resignation of the German ambassador to Russia, Nadolny, has attracted the deep attention of the Turkish press. The "Millet" newspaper stated that "the domestic and foreign governments of the National Socialist Party have collapsed." The newspaper believes that the German people all hoped that Nadolny would stabilize Soviet-German relations. The appointment of the new Soviet envoy to Germany, Suritz, further strengthened this expectation. However, Nadolny's resignation is ultimately a bankruptcy of the work of trying to improve Soviet-German relations. The difficulty this situation imposes on the Soviet Union is far less than that on Germany, because the former has emerged from its isolated position, while the latter is in a politically isolated position. However, the arrival of this situation is caused by Germany itself, because it refused several suggestions made by the Soviet government aimed at consolidating relations. The newspaper concluded that "the Baltic Pact is sufficient as the starting point for Soviet-German reconciliation, but Berlin rejected the Soviet Union's suggestions on this pact, which led to Nadolny's resignation. This matter is particularly worthy of reflection." (23rd TASS Telegram)</p>
<h3>Barthou Travels Through Eastern Europe to Consolidate the United Front, Receives a Warm Welcome from Allied Countries from Romania to Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: French Foreign Minister Barthou arrived in Olcuvat, Romania, on the Danube River, by train from the Romanian capital. Military music played, and national flags fluttered, making it a grand occasion. After Barthou arrived at the station, he bid farewell to his friends who had come to see him off on the Romanian side. He went to the banks of the Danube and boarded a yacht sent by the King of Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister, the French Minister to Yugoslavia, and many other dignitaries were on deck to greet him. As the ship passed through the famous "Iron Gate Gorge," residents on both banks played music and sang, and the cheers were thunderous. In the evening, the ship arrived at Donji Milanovac and anchored. When the ship arrived, cannons were fired on the shore, national music was played, and the cheers of the people added to the grand occasion. Barthou rested on the ship after dinner and will continue his journey tomorrow, arriving in the capital around 5:00 PM. (23rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: French Foreign Minister Barthou made a statement to the Yugoslav press, saying, "Romania is a friendly and allied country of Yugoslavia. In recent years, the national strength has been steadily increasing, which is admirable. During this trip, I conveyed the love and respect of the French people to the Romanian government. As for your country, it is no less than a country rebuilt after the war, and it is especially worthy of our respect. Your country is an indispensable factor in maintaining the balance of power in Europe. Your people are hardworking and have high morals, which is commendable. France and Yugoslavia share the same ideals and goals, and achieve them in the same way. Your King is the representative of Yugoslavia's ideals and aspirations, and we regard him as a great monarch, worthy of our respect." Barthou then spoke of Foreign Minister Jevtić, saying that the ability of the Little Entente and the effectiveness of the Balkan Pact can be seen in the Geneva Disarmament Conference. Finally, he said, "Yugoslavia is a loyal friend and ally of France, and I came to visit in the capacity of a friend and ally." (23rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Czech Capital: Foreign Minister Beneš recently returned home after participating in the Standing Political Committee of the Little Entente countries in Romania. Today, he reported to the State Council on the proceedings of the committee meeting and the results of his talks with the foreign ministers of Romania and Yugoslavia. He said that French Foreign Minister Barthou was present for most of the talks. Beneš then described various diplomatic issues that still need to be discussed. (23rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Madrid: The Republican Party's newspaper "Libertad" published an editorial commenting on French Foreign Minister Barthou's visit to the Romanian government, saying that Barthou is a true pillar on the new political stage in Europe. The atmosphere in Geneva this autumn will surely be renewed. By then, the League of Nations will have restored its prestige, and the rulers in Berlin will feel isolated and unable to continue their dangerous work. (24th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Philippines Form a National Defense Force Plan, the Total Number is Set at 50,000, Starting with Increasing the Number of Police, the Parliament Will Re-elect and Formulate a Transitional Constitution Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Manila: Governor Murphy is currently studying the plan to create a national army for the Philippines after independence. The total number is roughly 50,000, based on the current 4,800 police officers and 7,000 Filipino members of the U.S. National Guard. The first step is to increase the number of police officers to 10,000 in 1937, and then select retired soldiers and junior officers from the National Guard and give them positions in the National Army. However, in general, the Philippines will rely entirely on neutrality treaties and friendly relations with countries in the Far East as the foundation of its security after independence. Recently, Speaker Quezon also said that the Philippines cannot establish an army sufficient to defend the country within 30 years. (23rd Guomin Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Filipino citizens will elect 202 representatives on the 26th to meet in Manila to discuss and formulate the constitution of the transitional government. The constitutional conference is scheduled to begin on July 4, which is the anniversary of the signing of the Philippine Declaration of Independence. According to the Philippine Independence Act passed by the U.S. Congress, the transitional constitution must be established before March 24, 1936. However, Philippine leaders hope to reach an agreement within this year so that the transitional government can be established on January 1 of next year. After the constitution is drafted, it must be approved by the President of the United States before the Governor can notify the constitutional conference and have it formally passed by the people through a vote.

<h3>Communication Flying Torpedoes, Japanese Research Has Results</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Communication flying torpedoes have always been the subject of secret research in various countries, but have not been successfully developed. This time, the research by Engineer Kotani of the Aviation Research Institute of the Engineering Department of Osaka Imperial University has been quite practical. It has recently been decided to publicly test it on the university's athletic field. The shell is made of lightweight lead, filled with gunpowder, and uses an electrically-triggered detonation device. It has a speed of 800 kilometers per hour, 30 times the speed of an aircraft. When flying up and falling down, it adopts an automatic parachute-style switch. It is truly a dawn for the aviation industry, so this test is attracting much attention.

<h3>Naval Preliminary Talks are Full of Snags, the British Side Denies Proposing a Large Naval Expansion Plan, Japan Is Wary of Anglo-American Collusion</h3>
<p>(London) American newspapers reported that at the naval expert meeting on the 21st, the British side proposed a plan to increase the strength of the British Navy, which stunned the Americans. They expressed pessimism about the future of the meeting and caused great embarrassment to the British authorities. The British side has now denied this proposal and issued a statement on the 23rd, as follows:</p>
<p>In this Anglo-American preliminary negotiation, especially at the naval expert meeting, both sides can be candid and sincere, and there is no concealment in the discussions, with the aim of discovering common ground of agreement. Therefore, no definitive proposal could have been initially put forward at the naval expert meeting, and there was no fact of deciding whether to accept or reject it. (23rd Japanese United News Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Viewing the British demand for a large naval expansion plan from the standpoint of returning to the assertions made at the Geneva Conference at that time, there should be no room for compromise between Britain and the United States. However, the Japanese Navy, which is deeply concerned and has always been silent, believes that the British demand is an Anglo-American collusion to restrain Japan's demand to break the current ratio, and that it is a kind of intimidating policy. Therefore, it is wary of the progress of Anglo-American negotiations. (24th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the meeting of specialists from the United Kingdom and the United States, the United Kingdom strongly demanded an increase in the total tonnage, which caused an atmosphere close to rupture. The Japanese Navy authorities observed this as follows: (1) At the Geneva Conference in 1927 and the Lavradan Agreement in 1929, the United Kingdom advocated a small ship doctrine, but it was not agreed to due to the opposition of the United States. If the United Kingdom's current demand is a genuine assertion, then it is a return to the assertions before the Geneva Conference, and there will only be a rupture. (2) British public opinion has recently been very strong. Member of Parliament Admiral Keyes strongly advocated strengthening armaments, saying that although the United States is a neutral country, it cannot be trusted. Therefore, the competition between Britain and the United States in the navy is very dangerous. The Prime Minister MacDonald, who advocates disarmament conferences, is said to be in a dilemma, which may not be completely unfounded. (3) Although the United States is still facing financial difficulties recently, the United Kingdom's finances have improved since last year, and its influence has affected its attitude towards disarmament. (4) The United Kingdom feels threatened by French tank-type modern ships and hopes to amend existing treaties to counter them. Therefore, from this point of view, unless one of the United Kingdom or the United States yields, there will only be a rupture. There is also an atmosphere of Anglo-American joint opposition to Japan's demand to change the ratio, which is very worrying. (24th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Studies Countermeasures to Deal With Next Year's Naval Conference</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding next year's naval disarmament conference, Japan's policy and specific countermeasures are currently being vigorously studied by the Navy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities. The original plan can be made in the middle of this month. Once it is properly handled, the Navy, Army, and Foreign Affairs authorities will organize a naval disarmament preparation committee to formally discuss the original plan and consider the situation of the United Kingdom and the United States at that time to determine Japan's precise policy for the next naval conference. What is particularly noticeable is that the progress of the Anglo-American-Japanese preliminary negotiations currently being convened in London will significantly affect next year's conference.

<h3>Green Gauze Curtain Rises, Jidong Righteous Army Actively Reorganizes General Headquarters, Adopts Guerrilla Tactics</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Since late May, the Japanese and puppet troops have formed a new weapons battalion and launched a fierce attack on the Aodigou area of Yanji County, attempting to wipe out the Righteous Army. However, after the Righteous Army reorganized its general headquarters into three hundred groups, it adopted guerrilla tactics to avoid frontal conflicts and wasting ammunition. They first retreated from places such as Juzijie, Baicaogou, and Yilangou, and then engaged in a major battle with the Japanese and puppet troops behind Zuochengzi and Aodigou, killing more than ten Japanese soldiers below the rank of Sergeant Komai and more than thirty puppet soldiers. The Korean immigrant villages of Aodigou were only threatened and fled. Now that the sorghum is lush, the Righteous Army has begun active warfare since mid-June, seeking to recapture the previously abandoned areas. The day of their success is imminent.

<h3>Shanghai Insurance Industry Leader Discusses the Current Situation Between China and Japan: The Time for War in the Far East Is Not Yet Ripe; Japan Is a Significant Economic Enemy of the United States</h3>
<p>Los Angeles Shanghai insurance industry leader Mr. Stevens arrived here today and declared to the press that China and Japan will be major economic enemies of the United States in the future. Mr. Stevens believes that the United States need not worry about war breaking out in Asia recently. The wars between the United States and Japan, and between Japan and Russia, are both overblown. Since occupying Manchuria, Japan has been doing its best to reorganize and its economic development has spread across the globe. It does not want to be hindered by war. Japan's occupation of Manchuria was because China's progress made its position in Manchuria unsustainable, coupled with the economic recession at the time and the hardship of the Japanese people. Therefore, it took this action in one fell swoop. Now that fertile land has been acquired, the situation is very different. China's boycott of Japanese goods has now failed. After Japan abolished the gold standard, its recovery has been progressing day by day. As for China, it is now engaged in industrialization. In the future, when this plan succeeds, it will be the greatest development in the Far East. (23rd National Telegram)</p>

<h3>International Labor Conference Concludes; Forty-Hour Work Week Postponed for Discussion Next Year</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The International Labor Conference today passed a resolution to transfer the forty-hour work week plan to the management team for further consideration in the future and to include it on the agenda for next year's conference. It was then adjourned. (23rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The International Labor Conference closed today and will reconvene in 1935. At the last meeting, representatives from around the world reported on labor conditions and made many unimportant suggestions that had no significant impact on the working class. Before the adjournment, a proposal to reduce working hours internationally to forty hours per week to reduce unemployment was tabled by a vote of sixty-five to thirty-seven, and will be discussed again at the meeting in 1935. The conference formally invited the United States to join the Geneva International Labor Bureau, but with the reservation that if the United States accepts membership, it will not have any obligations to the League of Nations Covenant. It is now heard that the United States will join at next year's meeting. All delegates believe that the issue of reducing working hours to forty hours per week is important and requires the consent of the United States, so it was tabled at this conference.

<h3>Disarmament and Security Council Discusses Mutual Assistance Pact; British Representative Opposes Russian Proposal; France, Poland, and Other Countries Express Support</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Security Committee discussed the French proposal for a European mutual assistance pact, which included the Soviet definition of an aggressor state. Soviet representative Mr. Stein explained on the spot that such a pact would not be possible without a precise definition of an aggressor state. Mr. Stein further stated, "The Soviet definition of an aggressor state contained in the London Convention is the only precise definition." After analyzing the London Convention, Mr. Stein suggested establishing a 1934 committee as the legitimate successor to the 1933 committee. At the same time, this committee should express its attitude towards the plan drafted by its predecessor. Mr. Stein continued, "As far as the Soviet definition of an aggressor state is concerned, last year's plan has become a convention binding eleven countries. We cannot easily let this go without expressing our attitude." The British representative opposed Mr. Stein's suggestion, while the representatives of France, Yugoslavia, and Poland supported the Soviet representative's point of view. (23rd TASS dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hungarian-Yugoslav Border Dispute; Hungarian Government Sends Memorandum to the League of Nations Advocating Direct Negotiations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>(Geneva) On May 12 of this year, the Hungarian government submitted to the League of Nations Council a request to organize an investigation committee to investigate the truth of the accidental incidents that have occurred on the border between Hungary and Yugoslavia for several years and to determine responsibility. Subsequently, the League of Nations Council held a meeting on June 5 to study the matter. As the two countries, South Hungary, had the intention of direct negotiations, the Council believed that there was no need to discuss the content of the matter. Recently, the Yugoslav government submitted a memorandum to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Avenol, requesting that it be distributed to all member states. The memorandum stated the views of the Southern government on the border incidents, and its conclusion was that the Hungarian side had taken actions that harmed the territorial integrity and public order of neighboring countries, and that the Hungarian government had not done its best to prevent them, which was a failure to fulfill international obligations. The Southern government had requested the Hungarian government to prevent all kinds of terrorism, but it was ultimately ineffective. Therefore, the Southern country had no choice but to take legitimate defense measures within its territory, but its actions did not exceed the scope of international treaties. The memorandum advocated direct negotiations between the Southern country and Hungary, stating that it believed that it would be possible to negotiate appropriate measures to restore peace and security on the borders of the two countries. If this could be achieved, it would be a blessing for both countries. (23rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Situation Chaotic; Ministry of Finance Corruption Case Not Easily Solved Independently; Successor Cabinet Difficult to Produce; Various Parties Undertaking Manoeuvring; Army Minister Hayashi to Make Major Statement</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance corruption case is expanding due to the strict attitude of the prosecution authorities, which does not allow Minister of Justice Oyama to interfere. Moreover, the corruption case of former Vice Minister of Finance Kuroda and others is a derivative problem of extremely complex collusion between business and political circles, so it is not easy to extract the Ministry of Finance corruption case alone. It must be included in the overall corruption case and submitted for discussion. Moreover, it will take half a year before the full picture can be revealed. The Saito Prime Minister is also said to have realized that he should step down, but he is hesitant because it is difficult to choose a successor. Political manoeuvring is also very active, but it is not easy to reach a conclusion. The successor will have to wait for the military to speak before a decision can be made. Therefore, it is heard that Army Minister Hayashi will make a major statement. However, it is not easy to predict how the Army Minister will express himself. (24th China United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance scandal, which has raised the issue of Minister of Finance Takahashi's responsibility and given the current cabinet a major shock, is taking a long time to investigate due to its complex content. Now, through the efforts of the prosecution authorities, the entire process of bribery has been fully investigated. The prosecutor's office is taking the case very seriously because it is of great importance, in order to avoid errors in the facts of the prosecution. At present, the evidence is being compared and sorted out, and the relevant evidence can be investigated within days. Prosecutor Iwamura plans to completely clear up the case and then take appropriate procedures to hold a preliminary hearing. The progress of this investigation and its entire contents will be reported to Minister of Justice Oyama in a comprehensive report. The Minister of Justice will then report to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance based on Prosecutor Iwamura's report, and will also state the cases in which the defendants will be found guilty in the preliminary hearing. Therefore, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance can also use this as a reference for their advancement and retreat. (24th Japan United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Philippine Trade Policy to Adopt Import Proportional System, A Major Blow to Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, the Independent Petition Committee organized by Philippine Senator Manuel Quezon and others, during negotiations with the US government on independence, reached an understanding with the US government. Generally, it means that the Philippine side is preparing for independence, and the government must also make every effort to enable US imports to gain market share. Now, the authorities in the Philippines have indeed proposed increasing tariffs on cotton cloth, rayon, iron tools, etc. The Philippine government is now in a desperate situation where it must protect American goods, and even if it causes pain to the people, it will not hesitate. However, in order to alleviate this pain, the Philippine authorities have come up with a mitigation strategy, that is, to implement a distribution system for foreign trade, which is currently under active consideration. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that this distribution system in the Philippines will have a significant impact on Japanese-Philippine trade, so it is paying close attention to the handling of this matter.

<h3>The Whole Story of Ye Muhua's Brutal Murder; Overseas Chinese in Japan Are All in Danger; All Circles in the Capital Organize a Support Association</h3>
<p>Beijing News On May 24, Ye Muhua, an overseas Chinese student in Nagasaki, Japan, was brutally murdered by a Japanese student. The bad news spread, and people across the country were extremely angry. They sent telegrams to the government requesting serious negotiations. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also attached great importance to the case. Now, from relevant sources, the whole story of the case has been learned as follows:</p>
<p>Ye Muhua was from Fuqing County, Fujian Province. He went to Japan with his parents to do business in Kumamoto City when he was young. His parents ended their business and returned to China earlier due to old age. Muhua and his two brothers did not return to China with their parents because they were studying in Japan. His brother Yan Hua is 21 years old, Muhua is the second oldest at 19, and Di Guihua is 15. Muhua and Yan Hua studied at the Jeju High School in the city. They were repeatedly praised for their excellent character and learning. This spring, Yan Hua and Muhua graduated and planned to return to China to apply for the Central Military Academy in order to revitalize the country. Therefore, the three brothers went to Nagasaki this spring to enroll in the Overseas Chinese Shizhong to tutor in Chinese. Since entering the school, the Ye brothers have been diligent in their studies. Not only has their Chinese language progressed rapidly, but also other subjects. They are greatly encouraged by teachers and admired by classmates. In addition, the brothers have good character and appearance and are physically strong. They leave early and return late every day, like three little heroes. Unexpectedly, nearby Japanese students became jealous. The Ye brothers often suffered unreasonable ridicule and dishonorable insults from the Japanese students, but the Ye brothers never cared about it because the motherland was in a time of great national crisis and they were living under someone else's roof. Until after school on May 23, when the Ye brothers were returning home, the Japanese students blocked them on the way, making even more severe provocations and insults. In order to get rid of the oppression, the Ye brothers were forced to argue with them. Unexpectedly, the Japanese students knew that they were in the wrong, and they dispersed one after another. However, although the Ye brothers knew that the Japanese students would never give up because of this, they never expected that a catastrophic disaster would occur the next day. The next morning, when the Ye brothers were going to school, the Japanese students gathered again to block them on the way, wantonly insulting them and even killing them with knives. Yan Hua and Gui Hua were lucky enough to escape the tiger's mouth, but the unfortunate Muhua was stabbed in the chest by the Japanese students and died tragically. Since the occurrence of this tragedy, overseas Chinese in Japan have been extremely dissatisfied and have convened an emergency meeting, requesting Consul Liu in Nagasaki to lodge a protest with the Japanese government. After receiving the bad news of Muhua's tragic death, the parents of Ye also rushed to Nagasaki day and night to bury Muhua. When he was being encoffined, the overseas Chinese who went to the funeral all shed tears. Overseas Chinese in Japan witnessed this tragic scene and were all in danger. Therefore, the United Association of Overseas Chinese in Kyushu, Japan, and the United Association of Overseas Chinese Groups in Nagasaki, etc., successively requested the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to forward a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese authorities, severely punish the perpetrators, compensate the family for support expenses, and guarantee that the same incident would not happen again. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission duly requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately instructed Minister Jiang in Japan on June 1 to forward a request to the Japanese government to severely punish the murderers and pay attention to the trial. At the same time, our country's Consul Liu Ruxiang in Nagasaki also repeatedly asked the local prefectural governor to be responsible for protecting overseas Chinese. The Governor of Nagasaki Prefecture formally replied to Consul Liu, saying that he deeply regretted the unfortunate incident that had occurred and that he would pay special attention to preventing the recurrence of such incidents in the future. As for the embassy in Japan, it is still negotiating on the case. People's groups in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Beijing, and other places across the country have sent telegrams to the ambassador in Japan requesting serious negotiations to achieve the goal of punishing the murderers and protecting overseas Chinese. The Nanyang Overseas Chinese Comrades Association in Nanjing also invited the Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Association in Beijing and the Overseas Comrades Association who were expelled to initiate the organization of the Ye Case Support Association by all circles in the capital.</p>

<h3>Recent Economic Situation in Japan (Japan Correspondence): Decline of Rural Economy, Collapse of Silk Industry</h3>
<p>The foundation of Japanese industry does not lie in heavy industry, but in the textile industry. Among the textile industries, raw silk is the most important. During the prosperous era of the raw silk industry in 1925, raw silk exports reached a peak of 879 million Japanese yen. Ninety percent of these exports were to the United States. However, since 1929, affected by the economic panic, the United States was hit the hardest. The extra consumption of the general public in the United States, especially for silk products, suddenly decreased. Nevertheless, in 1929, Japan's raw silk exports still accounted for one-third of its total trade exports, amounting to 700 million Japanese yen. Thereafter, the market situation deteriorated day by day. The general consumption in the United States decreased more and more, and silk production also decreased accordingly. Moreover, the progress of artificial silk fabrics has been increasing. Therefore, by 1930, Japan's raw silk exports had dropped to about 419 million Japanese yen, and in the recent three years, exports have even fallen to around 300 million Japanese yen. The decline of this industry, judging only from these few figures, already gives a glimpse of the general situation.</p>
<p>The drop in raw silk market prices was originally a cancerous tumor of the Japanese economy. Since last year, silk prices have been able to maintain profitable transactions due to the cheap exchange rate of the Japanese yen. Since the beginning of this spring, as a result of the devaluation of the US dollar, the convenience of the Japanese yen in exchange rates has gradually been lost. Japanese silk sales to the United States have suffered a huge blow as a result. After the spring cocoons came onto the market in June, silk prices even fell below the 500 yen mark. The average price of cocoons per "kan" (7.5 catties) is about 2.56 yen. Under such circumstances, silkworm farmers have to lose about one yen.</p>
<p>Now, the situations of various famous prefectures are cited as examples. In Shizuoka Prefecture, the production cost per "kan" of silkworm cocoons is: 1.36 yen for mulberry leaves, 0.2004 yen for silkworm eggs, 1.40 yen for labor wages, 0.114 yen for silkworm rearing tools, 0.107 yen for temperature control, 0.09 yen for various taxes, 0.135 yen for miscellaneous expenses, and 0.131 yen for silkworm room expenses, totaling 3.541 yen in production costs. However, the average market price of spring cocoons in the prefecture this year is only 2.70 yen. Therefore, silkworm farming families have to lose 0.841 yen per "kan" of spring cocoons. The mountain villages that mainly rely on silkworm farming are becoming increasingly exhausted. This situation, viewed as a whole, is certainly more pessimistic than optimistic.</p>
<p>Nagano Prefecture is also one of the main raw silk producing prefectures in Japan. In recent years, it has been overwhelmed by the impact of the panic. The difficulty of people's lives is almost insufficient to provide warmth and food. When the income from cocoon prices per "kan" in the spring, summer, and autumn of last year was about 5.20 yen, the expenses, such as the soaring prices of fertilizers and agricultural tools, compared to the income and expenditure of middle-class farmers, still resulted in a deficit of 30 to 40 yen. This year, the cocoon price has fallen to about 2.50 yen. Is it not the case that the general rural economy is falling into a state of bankruptcy?</p>
<p>Ibaraki Prefecture is also known for its silkworm and mulberry cultivation. Last year, the average market price of spring cocoons was 6.16 yen. This year, the opening price in the Ryugasaki market is only 2.38 yen, which is even lower than the lowest price of 2.47 yen in 1932 by 0.09 yen. This is indeed an unprecedented drop in the cocoon price market.</p>
<p>Based on this type of price, the total income from cocoons, calculated on average, is 1.95 million "kan," and the total cocoon price income should be 4.641 million yen. Compared with last year's 2 million "kan" of cocoon income at a market price of 6.16 yen, it will decrease by as much as 7.679 million yen. In other words, each silkworm farming household will reduce its income by 109.70 yen. This kind of blow has ultimately placed all the prefecture's farming families in extreme poverty. Even selling children is not enough to pay taxes. Therefore, the amount of late payment of local taxes in the prefecture has exceeded one million yen. Even the farmers' association fees cannot be paid. Fertilizer stores are closing down one after another. All levels of society are therefore in the same dire situation.</p>
<p>As for other prefectures such as Chiba, Yamanashi, and other prefectures that cultivate silkworms and mulberry trees, although the severity varies slightly, the overall panic is exactly the same. In the future, Japanese silk mills may take advantage of the low cocoon prices to buy as much as possible in order to seek high profits in the future. However, the current US silk market not only has no signs of rising, but also has a downward trend. Japanese silk mills have already suffered considerable losses, and the wounds have not yet healed. How can they let go of receiving them? In that case, even with government subsidies, it may not be easy to maintain. The current livelihoods of all 2.3 million silkworm and mulberry farming households in Japan, and more than 350,000 female silk mill workers from farming families are threatened. The impact of this on the entire Japanese economic community is feared to be even more severe than in 1932. (June 17, Tokyo)</p>

<h3>Through-Traffic Technical Conference to Be Held</h3>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The final technical conference on through-traffic between Peiping and Shenyang has been scheduled to be held in Tianjin tomorrow (the 24th). Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, went to Tianjin at 8:30 AM today (the 23rd) to prepare for the conference matters. Liao Lixiangtao, General Manager of the China Travel Service, arrived in Tianjin this morning (the 23rd) at 7:30 AM from Beijing by the Peiping-Shanghai through-train, accompanied by three senior staff members of the company, to meet with Zhang Dezhi, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company, who arrived in Tianjin from Peiping yesterday. He Jingwu, Advisor to the Ministry of Railways, was ordered to represent the Ministry of Railways and attended the Tianjin conference on the same train. The Japanese attendees, including Suzuki, Director of the International Tourism Bureau of the Ministry of Railways (the International Tourism Bureau that does travel affairs in various countries and regions), was dispatched to Dalian a few days ago and arrived in Tianjin today with four technical personnel from the East Asia General Bureau of the Japan Tourism Bureau in Dalian. Manten Representative Koukyu is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin from Shenyang tomorrow (the 24th). The conference is scheduled to be held at the Beining official residence tomorrow afternoon. During the conference, Yin Tong will give a detailed report on the through-traffic plan and implementation details, and discuss the various procedures for the "jointly established" "travel agency" between China and Japan in detail. If the conference goes smoothly, it can be completed tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. After the closing of the conference, the establishment of "travel agencies" in Tianjin, Yushun, and other places will begin. The Beining Railway Bureau has notified the Peiping and Tianjin Vehicle Operations Departments to step up preparations, assign through-traffic service personnel, schedule train times, and allocate office addresses for the travel agencies.

<h3>Trends in the Siamese Overseas Chinese Community</h3>
<p>The situation is deteriorating day by day, and labor strikes are becoming increasingly fierce. The ban on Chinese schools makes it increasingly difficult for overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Bangkok Correspondence: The Siamese overseas Chinese community in recent years has been more turbulent than ever before. Especially since this year, it can be described as an eventful time. Recently, two major events have occurred, which can prove the trends and fluctuations in the Siamese overseas Chinese community. The so-called two major cases are: (1) The railway workers' strike, and (2) The closure of more than a dozen Chinese schools. The Siamese Ministry of Education established a Chinese language college. After the national railway workers went on strike, the rice mill workers also went on strike. The labor strikes have spread throughout Siam. From the strike wave, the following phenomena can be seen: (1) Workers are becoming increasingly aware, (2) The economic panic in Siamese society is becoming increasingly serious, (3) The opposition between labor and capital is becoming increasingly acute, and (4) The workers' living suffering has led workers to actively resist.</p>
<p>As for the closure of Chinese schools, it has recently become a hot topic of discussion. Since the Chongshi School was forcibly closed, it has aroused serious attention and unease in the overseas Chinese community. The most noteworthy results are: (1) Private Chinese schools will decrease day by day, while official Chinese language colleges will increase day by day, (2) Overseas Chinese children cannot read much Chinese, but must read more Siamese, (3) Siamese teachers will increase day by day, while Chinese teachers will decrease day by day, (4) Chinese teachers who understand Siamese superficially will increase day by day, while excellent Chinese teachers who do not understand Siamese will decrease day by day, and (5) Overseas Chinese children will gradually forget their motherland.</p>
<p>The labor strikes can prove that the class struggle in Siamese society is becoming more and more fierce. The Chinese language colleges are the cultural oppression of our overseas Chinese by the Siamese government, which is a manifestation of Siamese nationalism. From now on, the environment in which overseas Chinese live in Siam will become more and more恶劣. For the future of the nation, it is really worrying. (China News Agency)</p>
<h3>Sichuan Army Recovers Tongjiang, Red Bandit Headquarters All Moved to Wanyuan, Fan and Xu Divisions Divide and Pursue</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The remnant bandits in northern Sichuan, affected by the blockade and lacking supplies, knew that long-term defense was not a plan. They decided to change their plan, reluctantly abandoned Tongjiang, concentrated on Chengwan, and planned to flee into the Yangtze River to develop elsewhere. On the 19th, the bandits in front of Tongjiang began to move backward. Tang Shizun, commander-in-chief of the Fifth Route Army for Suppressing Bandits, reported that he ordered the right-wing army to continue to attack Wanyuan fiercely to threaten the bandits. At the same time, he ordered the right-wing army's Fan Shaozeng and Xu Yaoqing divisions to take the opportunity to recover Tongjiang and destroy the bandit's lair. On the 20th, the Tongjiang Red Bandit headquarters completely withdrew to Wanyuan. The city defense was empty. The Fan and Xu divisions then contacted and attacked. The Fan Division was responsible for attacking Tongjiang County, and the Xu Division was responsible for attacking Zhenlongguan. On the evening of the 21st, they were recovered separately. The city fell in early June of last year and has been around for a year. The bandits used it as their general base. Xu Xiangqian's pseudo headquarters was located here. After the recovery of Nanjiang, the pseudo Sichuan-Shaanxi Soviet Government moved again from Changchi. Its position became even more important. Now that the encirclement has been formed, they have to abandon it and go elsewhere. In addition, the bandits trapped Tongjiang and tried their best to trap the people to fill military service. After many fierce battles, the basic bandit population from Hubei and Henan died and were injured slightly. The trapped people were not well trained, and the bandit's hearts were not firm, making it even more difficult to deal with the national army. This was also a factor in abandoning Tongjiang. However, the bandits who were coerced were not very convinced. Under the pressure of violence, they had to echo each other. Some also lowered their hearts to follow in order to preserve their family property. Once they leave their hometown and flee to the Yangtze River, betting their lives on a lone bet is not what they want. There will inevitably be infighting in the future. As for the details of the recovery of Tongjiang, Tang Shizun and Fan Shaozeng have reported to Hankou by telegram, saying, "According to a telephone report from Division Commander Fan, the bandits in front have been fiercely attacked by our right wing for days, and Wanyuan has been greatly threatened. Our army took advantage of the victory to attack. Our Zhou Shaoxuan Brigade advanced from Desheng Mountain. This afternoon, it approached Tongjiang. It happened that 4,000 to 5,000</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>bandits could not retreat in time and were severely attacked by us. After several hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were defeated and fled in the directions of Maoyuzhen, Hongkou, and Xiongxikou. Our army then completely occupied Tongjiang at 7:00 PM, capturing hundreds of bandits and seizing countless supplies and spoils of war. At the same time, Liao Brigade occupied Zhuxingchang, Fan Brigade occupied Mashichang, and Meng Brigade occupied Shimenchang. According to a telephone call from Division Commander Xu, our Seventh and Eighth Brigades occupied Zhenlongguan, Wolongzhai, and Yongding this evening. The bandits fled in the direction of Zhibaokou and Weijiaping. In addition to ordering the Fan Division to divide and pursue in the direction of Maoyuzhen and Hongkou, and the Xu Division to divide and pursue in the direction of Zhibaokou and Weijiaping, I especially report that Tang Shizun and Fan Shaozeng kowtow and ask for instructions."

<h3>Gan Bandits Disturb Qimen, Provincial Fellow Countrymen's Associations Beg for Help from All Sides</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Qimen in Huizhou, surrounded by mountains and rivers, has an important strategic position. It is the gateway to southern Anhui. Recently, because of Gan Bandit Fang Zhimin's serious pressure from the national army, he plans to advance from Qimen and occupy six counties in Huizhou as a base. He sent his troops to wantonly disturb the area. Qicheng is in a very dangerous situation. The provincial fellow countrymen's associations in the county have repeatedly received letters and telegrams from their hometowns, reporting the disturbances caused by the bandits. Yesterday, Ni Wenru, who escaped from Qimen to the province, reported in detail that the spread of bandits in Qimen has reached Chawan, Daohu, Qicen, Baitao, Zhangcun, and other places, which have been ravaged by bandits one after another. Burning, killing, looting, kidnapping, and extortion have forced the residents of far and near to move away. Those who were unable to move away were mostly forced to become bandits and driven to the front line to disrupt various places. There are so-called "spear teams," "vanguard teams," "carrying pole teams," and "red guard teams." Recently, after the bandits broke into Dajiang Village in Fuliang Taoshudian and burned and killed, the pseudo-Soviet government in Chengjiashan, the bandit's nest, ordered to divide into three groups to spy on Gangkou Likou, including Zhang Jiuling's Fangjiawu group, about 200 people, 30 miles from Zhukou, the Dafangli group under Daohu, about 400 to 500 people, 50 miles from Zhukou, and the group that broke into Dajiang Village and invaded Yankeng in Fuliang, planning to take a small mountain path and rush straight to Daqiaotou (the place is 15 miles from Zhukou and more than 10 miles from Likou, all mountain roads) and out. Internally, the teams in Gaotang, Shanli, Wentang, and Ruokeng, and externally, the teams in Likou, Xiaolukou, Zhukou, and other places are cut in half, and the western townships of Qimen will be broken without attacking. From the 13th to the 16th of this month, Zhukou and Likou were in a very dangerous situation. The local teams and strong men have been guarding for two months. In this situation of being attacked from three sides, the situation is serious. If there is no capable army to rush to aid quickly, the situation in Qimen may be out of control. After hearing the news, the association convened an emergency meeting of provincial fellow countrymen on the 21st and decided on the following important matters: (1) Pushing Chen Bihao, Hu Weihou, Fang Douwen, Ni Wenru, etc. to petition the Provincial Government Security Office and quickly send a strong brigade to garrison Qimen; (2) Pushing another representative to the National Government Military Committee and Nanchang Military Committee Executive Office to request the dispatch of a strong brigade to suppress the bandits as soon as possible; (3) Sending a telegram to the Qimen County Government, the Defense Committee, and the sub-district offices, asking them to send letters at any time to keep abreast of the news; (4) Sending a telegram to Chen Diaoyuan, Commander-in-Chief of Wuyuan, to quickly send a strong brigade to suppress the bandits.

<h3>Northwest Inspection Notes: Our Special Correspondent Gengya. Camels and Horses are Genuinely Natured, Human Hearts Often Fake.</h3>
<p>At dawn on the second day, Mongol women living within three or four miles were riding horses and driving cattle to draw water from the well. Dressed in leather boots and qipao, their movements were agile. (Yurts are mostly built on slopes to face the sun and easily watch the sheep. Wells are often dug on flat ground and several miles apart, so horses are used for transportation.) The camel drivers chatted with them, not easily smiling. An old man held leather to trade for flour. The camel driver lowered the leather and raised the demand for flour, deliberately making things difficult. The old man spoke in Chinese, saying, "Camels and horses are genuinely natured, human hearts are often fake." This is probably a Mongolian proverb, which feels particularly cautionary. Later, the old man untied his belt (Mongols wear long robes, with cloth belts tied around their waists, and when walking, they tuck the corners of their robes inside the belt, and the empty belt can also hold things), poured out a liter of salt grains, and offered them to the camel driver, asking for a small amount of white flour in return. The camel driver said, "There is not much food to carry on a long journey, and there are often times when it is difficult to support oneself. Green salt is a local product here. Why do you expect a reward after giving it away?" The old man sighed and said, "Bao Tou camel drivers are really hard to deal with. The oil they squeeze out of people is more severe than eating livestock meat." Hearing this, I couldn't help but smile. Last night, three camels were deeply mired in the mud and became lame. The old man claimed to be a veterinarian and pierced the camels' thighs to let out blood, healing two of them. The other one had a different illness. The old man was willing to stay and treat it. If it recovered, he would be paid two yuan; if it died, one yuan, but he needed the camel's lip as proof. At three o'clock in the afternoon, we set off from Zao Shu. The sandy land was flat, about a hundred li, and covered with wild buckwheat, without any wormwood, as if it had been cultivated before, but there were no plow marks or human settlements. It was probably uncultivated wilderness. Seventy li away was Jian Lake, where we set up camp for the night. There was a well without a beam, and a lot of camel dung had been blown into it. The water was yellow and tasted bitter, but the camel drivers drank it as usual, as they had no other choice.</p>
<p>Inner Mongolia is rich in salt, especially alkali. In Ordos Banner alone, there are four large alkali lakes. The Mongols do not know how to exploit them, and for a long time, the goods are abandoned on the ground. Zheng Haifeng from Ningxia, who is good at dealing with the "King of Ordos," lent the king money, with the principal and interest reaching more than 800,000 yuan. During the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, although the amount was only more than 200,000 yuan, the king was unable to repay it, so he pledged the three alkali lakes of Chahan, Nalin, and Hama Geta Nor to Zheng. The remaining lakes are smaller in area and have the best alkali quality, but the king superstitiously believes them to be sacred lakes and prohibits their exploitation, fearing that disasters will befall the entire banner's cattle and sheep, causing them to die of plague, so he protects them with all his might. Zheng obtained the three lakes and managed them diligently, exploiting them simultaneously and selling them widely in Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai for more than thirty years, seemingly inexhaustible. The alkali field is called the Daxing Company. The king owes more than 800,000 yuan to the company. In addition to preferential treatment of no further interest, he also provides the royal palace with daily necessities worth about 3,000 yuan every year. Chahan Alkali Lake is fifteen li away from the lodging place, conveniently located next to the road we will take tomorrow, so we decided to visit it.</p>
<p>On the morning of the third day, we made an appointment to go ahead of the group and walked to Chahan Alkali Lake. The lake surface is about twenty li long from north to south and four or five li wide from east to west, a white expanse, dazzling and blinding, all several feet thick of naturally crystallized alkali. The method of mining is easy. In winter and spring, the alkali is cut into pieces weighing one or two hundred catties, stacked on the lake shore, towering like mountains. This is called raw alkali, worth two yuan per hundred catties. Small pieces and debris are refined into cooked alkali, which sells for two yuan and four jiao per hundred catties. When transported to Ningxia, raw alkali sells for five yuan, and cooked alkali for more than six yuan. The refining of alkali is purely done using local methods. First, the raw alkali is soaked in water to dissolve it, removing the sediment and sand. Then, it is boiled to concentrate it, taken out, molded into rectangular shapes, and exposed to the sun until half dry, then stored in underground cellars, taking care to prevent it from becoming too dry and turning into powder. The company has sixteen stoves and four workers, producing sixteen pieces of cooked alkali per day. The workers earn six yuan per month, while those who move the raw alkali earn three yuan, all with food provided. Those who chop raw alkali with axes earn six fen per piece, and can earn about one yuan per day, but without food provided. The food is millet, with no vegetables on ordinary days. Meat and noodles are given on festivals and the first and fifteenth of the lunar month. They wear clothes and trousers lined with camel hair, which protrudes outwards, and they keep their hair in braids, looking unlike humans. When Mr. Zhu asked several young workers if they were "willing to go to a certain place together," they readily replied, "Even if we die, we are unwilling, for fear of being 'picked up' to be soldiers." Upon detailed inquiry, they said, "Two months ago, a worker was about to get married and went to a certain place to buy things. Suddenly, he disappeared. His father investigated and found that he was filling the ranks in a certain camp. When he went to the camp to ask for his release, everyone said, 'This person was 'picked up' on the road and claims to be your son. Who would believe that?'" His father cried and returned, nearly driven mad. After the conversation, I felt that the word "picked up" was infinitely useful and laughed incessantly. Mr. Yang was originally from a certain place and frequently wrote *Inpeep* on the ground, probably suspecting that I didn't believe it.</p>
<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon, the camel team arrived. Seeing that there was a lot of foreign alkali loaded, I couldn't help but feel deeply. The Mongolian land produces alkali so abundantly, and the northwest's vast pastures raise cattle and sheep, producing a lot of oil, all of which are raw materials for refined soaps and detergents. It is a pity that no one advocates for their manufacturing, which allows large quantities of foreign alkali from Tianjin to be imported, causing profits to flow out and making a living more difficult. Eating with a golden bowl while begging for food is sad and pitiful. At night, black clouds rose on all sides, densely obscuring the starlight. The guest in front accidentally touched the eye of the camel behind with his flashlight, and the camel behind was startled and ran away, abandoning its goods all over the field. The camel team that arrived later searched for and gathered all the goods and rushed to the destination, Shiban well. The journey was only seventy li, but the east was about to turn white. There are three wells in total, not far apart, two bitter and one sweet, which is considered remarkable.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock on the morning of the fourth day, two Mongolian women came to the well to water their sheep, one seventeen years old and the other only ten years old, with dark skin and white teeth, and healthy bodies. The camel driver transporting alkali spoke to them in Mongolian, and learned that the two women were not sisters, but both had lost their parents when they were young. They were specially employed by the King of Ordos (the royal palace is about four li from here; the king went to worship Buddha and had not returned for three days, so we did not visit) to graze sheep and provide food and clothing, without wages, for five years. The king raises four thousand and several hundred sheep and five hundred horses, all of which are assigned to the people of the banner for rotational grazing. The government offices and the royal palace also use the people for rotational service, one month per person, commonly known as "ch差事 (errands)." Also, the sheep raised by the royal palace are all levied from the people, what is called "grabbing one out of fifty, grabbing two out of one hundred."</p>
<p>Mr. Luo took out picture books to show them, and the two girls pointed with their fingers and spoke, appearing very happy. Seeing pictures of airplanes, bicycles, and cameras, the elder girl spoke Chinese, mistaking "airplane" and "car" for "wireless telegraph," which was clearly audible. The crowd said that she probably could speak fluent Chinese, but this was not the case. Because these things are not native to Mongolia, their names were transliterated from Chinese, so they still use foreign words. Later, Mr. Fan held up a jar and asked if they had sheep milk to sell. The elder girl understood and ordered the younger girl to lead a ewe over. Then, she knelt on the ground to milk it, and the jar was soon full. I took the opportunity to take a photo, which she saw, and she insisted on having one washed and given to her immediately, looking very foolish. Later, two more Mongolian women came, with dignified manners, not smiling or speaking, lacking the innocence of the two girls. This was probably due to the constraints of etiquette after marriage.</p>
<p>At 2 PM, we departed from Shiban Well and remotely saw the Ordos King's Palace (private residence) and government offices, separated by about an arrow's distance, all being Chinese-style courtyard tile houses. At dusk, we passed a high ridge with three tile houses, said to be barracks, but there were no soldiers. The night was dark and the clouds were thick, and we lost our way. The camel team was divided into several sections, unable to connect, so we stopped by a riverside. As soon as the tents were set up, a heavy rain arrived. On this day, we traveled sixty li, and there were still twenty li to the destination, Qian Well.</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Government Subsidizes the Planting of Fertile Peaches</h3>

<h3>Jiangsu Department of Finance to Establish County Treasuries in Each County Starting Next Year, Four Banks Designated to Handle Education and Other Funds While Maintaining Independent Nature</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: In order to rectify the finances of various counties, the Jiangsu Department of Finance specially summoned the county magistrates of various counties to the province one after another to discuss the establishment of county budgets. After more than a month of discussions, the budgets of various counties have been established one after another, and it is planned to designate the four banks of China, Transportation, Jiangsu, and Farmers, starting next year, to establish county treasuries in various counties to exclusively handle the financial affairs of the county. Counties without the above four banks will temporarily maintain the status quo. It is heard that after the establishment of the treasury, special funds for education, construction, public security, warehousing, etc. will all maintain their independent nature and will never be misappropriated. As for the saying that each county will restore the financial bureau, according to the person in charge of the Finance Department, the provincial government is currently in a period of tightening, and it will never set up this redundant agency to avoid wasting public funds. Also, in order to select true accounting talents, a special accountant examination was held at Zhenjiang Normal School. More than fifty people took the exam. The exam papers have been roughly graded. For the sake of precise selection, it is heard that only seventeen people will be admitted, which may be officially announced around Tuesday (the 24th).</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Mosquito Coil Burns Three to Death</h3>
<p>As the summer season arrives, mosquitoes and flies swarm, disturbing people's sleep. As a result, mosquito coils have sprung up in time. Songjiang originally had locally made mosquito repellent drugs, which were made by mixing wood chips with realgar and other ingredients, wrapping them in paper rolls, and burning them to repel mosquitoes. The smell was strong, and working-class households generally liked to use them because they were cheap. Yesterday, a certain Lu family living in Mo Jia Alley rented a small room, which was the bedroom for two old women and two children. One old woman, over eighty years old, slept alone in a bed. Her daughter, fifty-eight years old, slept with her grandson, four years old, and her granddaughter, six years old, in the same bed. The parents of the two children lived in a shop on the main street. A mosquito repellent was lit in front of the bed. At about 4 a.m. this morning, the family living in the same house discovered that thick smoke was coming from the room. They knocked down the door and found that the bed curtains of the fifty-eight-year-old woman and the two children were on fire, and the bedding was burnt. The grandmother and the two children were all on the verge of death. The heads of the two children were red and swollen, and their condition was very tragic. After the neighbors carried them to the Reese Hospital for treatment, they were considered to be in danger. They were carried home, and the two children died one after another. The grandmother saw this and also died of crying blood. The sudden death of three lives in one family can be said to be extremely tragic.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Old Man Kills Daughter-in-Law Case Occurs in Guangfu</h3>
<p>In Hulong Village, Guangfu Township, Suzhou, an old farmer, Fu Yunshan, who is already sixty-seven years old, his widowed daughter-in-law, Ms. Lu, who is thirty-eight years old, became acquainted with a Taoist priest from Maoshan Temple, Ru A'xiao, two years ago. The matter was learned by her father-in-law, Yunshan, who advised her to no avail. A few days ago, the daughter-in-law wanted to go out again and was stopped by the old man. The daughter-in-law actually beat the old man. Yunshan was angry for a moment and stabbed Ms. Lu's abdomen with a sharp knife. After being injured, Ms. Lu died of serious injuries on the morning of the 23rd. The competent public security sub-bureau immediately summoned the murderer, Fu Yunshan, to the bureau, inquired about the process, and transferred the case to the public security bureau for investigation. At the same time, it reported to the local prosecutor's office to send personnel for inspection. However, the adulterer, Ru A'xiao, had already fled upon hearing the news.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: County Government Takes Over City Funds Association</h3>
<p>After the Municipal Funds Property Management Committee of this county was ordered to be abolished, the public has paid considerable attention to the issue of taking over. Gu Shuzhi, the chairman of the committee, believes that since the committee has been abolished, it is necessary to quickly handle the end and prepare for the handover, so as to relieve the responsibility. Yesterday, he personally brought the handover list to the county and met with County Magistrate Yan, requesting to send personnel to take over. County Magistrate Yan believes that according to provincial regulations, the takeover should be handled by the county property office, so he discussed with Qian Sunqing, the director of the office, and urged him to send staff to take over. Qian has not yet determined the method for handling treasury affairs this time, so he has no reason to ask about the city funds again, so he firmly declined to take over. The county government then sent Section Chief Fei Yunong of the Second Section and staff Zhu Fangshi, Jiang Zhizhen, Shi Zhaolan, and Zhang Xiaochu to take over. The committee staff Chen Hanxiang handed over the asset map records, Yang Lianhui handed over the files, Jiang Fanqian handed over the silver money account books and equipment, and Gu Hubing handed over the land rent account books and contracts, and Huang Mengxi handed over the house donation, hotel donation, tea donation, and police donation, as well as the registers. Qin Xixian and Zheng Deliang handed over the house donation deposit ticket registers. After the counting and handover was completed, seals were affixed. Important documents were taken to the county for safekeeping. The original staff were ordered to collect all kinds of donations from the committee as usual, so as not to cause stagnation. The issue of park management will be raised for discussion at the political affairs meeting this Monday (25th), and a public park management committee may still be organized to manage it. According to Wu Jianzhen, the third section chief of the Jiangsu Education Department who came to Wuxi to inspect social education, he said that it is clear and obvious that parks should be managed by the education bureau, not only in various countries but also in various places in the country, and also in neighboring Wuxian and Wujin. Wuxi Park is not privately owned, so it should undoubtedly be managed by the education bureau.</p>
<h3>Villager Hangs Himself in Ancestral Grave</h3>
<p>Zhang Sanbao, a resident of Jincheng Baishuidang Qianxiang in the third district, about two li from Zhouxin Town, who is 22 years old, has been a contractor coppersmith in a foundry in Nanmatou, Shanghai, earning thirty to forty yuan a month. However, because Zhang's family had suffered from a fire in the past, he was responsible for heavy debts. All household expenses were borne by Sanbao. Recently, his mother, Zhou, repeatedly sent letters asking for household expenses. Sanbao was short of money and could not cope, so he quietly returned to Wuxi the day before yesterday, but did not go home. He did not know where he stayed that night. At about 6 o'clock yesterday morning, he went to the large oak tree next to his father, Quanfu's grave, and hanged himself. When he was discovered by a village child, it was too late to save him. He immediately notified his mother, Zhou, who carried the body back and put it in a coffin. On one side, the head of the 252nd tu, Wang Hongfu, reported to the authorities and requested an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Small River Ferry Robbed En Route</h3>
<p>There are two ferries between Wuyi City and Xiahe Town, which are berthed under the Cangqiao bridge in the west gate, and are convenient for daily round-trip voyages to carry passengers and goods. At about 3 p.m. on the 22nd, one of the ships sailing from the city was sailing to Huangni Bay near Benniu Town at about 9 p.m., when suddenly seven or eight bandits came and ordered the ship to stop. Then they boarded the ship with weapons and searched for stolen goods. All the foreign money hidden by the shipowner and passengers was stolen. The next day (23rd)</p>
<p>The shipowner came to the city to report the case, and the ferry continued to sail to Xiahe.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Party Affairs Disputes Send Personnel to Sort Out</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, because of repeated disputes in Jiangyin party affairs, this time because of the replacement of Standing Committee member Chen Xiping, another dispute arose. Executive Committee members Chen Lan and Wang Jihua submitted their resignations. Li Jingzhai, a special envoy from the Central Committee, sent Zhang Mingren, a cadre of the training department (from Jiangdu) as a special envoy to Jiangyin to guide the handling of Jiangyin party affairs. At the same time, Wu Zunyi (from Dantu) was sent as a special envoy to Nantong, and Sun Danchen (from Jiangyin) was sent as a special envoy to Wuxian.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Construction Department Examines Car Staff</h3>
<p>The Vehicle Staff Training Institute sponsored by the Jiangsu Construction Department,</p>
<p>Since the beginning of enrollment, the number of applicants has been very enthusiastic. The institute originally set the number of students at 100. In addition to the 50 people jointly guaranteed by the 13 long-distance bus companies in Jiangsu Province, only 50 people were admitted. The large number of job seekers and the bleak social economy are evident here. The institute is scheduled to hold an exam at 8 a.m. on the 24th in the Zhenjiang Normal School Auditorium. The department attaches great importance to the examination procedures and has established an examination committee to preside over it. After the grading of the papers is completed, an official list will be announced and the school will be scheduled to open. Because the institute does not have a suitable address for teaching, it is heard that it will take advantage of the summer vacation of Zhenjiang Normal School and use the school for teaching. The training period is set for two and a half months. Once the training period expires, those with excellent results will be assigned to various long-distance bus companies to take up positions. Nantong</p>
<h3>The Post and Telegraph Bureaus are Ordered to Merge Within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>The Nantong Post and Telegraph Bureaus have not yet merged because they have not found suitable houses. Sun Shenlin, a patrol officer of the Jiangsu and Anhui Postal District, and Chen Xizhou, the director of the Jiangsu Telegraph Administration Bureau, came to Nantong from Nanjing to urge the merger to be implemented by the end of the month. It has been surveyed that the city market room in the south of the city will be established on July 1.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Zhang Guozhang's Young Son Kidnapped</h3>
<p>In the southeast of Hai Fu Town in the sixth district, about two li away, the farmer Zhang Guozhang, whose family is wealthy, has long been coveted by bandits. At about 9 p.m. the day before yesterday (21st), more than ten bandits suddenly came, speaking in mixed accents, holding box guns, hemp ropes, etc., kicked open the door and entered, twisted and beat Zhang</p>
<p>Zhu Zhu was beaten violently and forced to hand over silver dollars. Unable to succeed, he kidnapped Zhang's six-year-old son. Other clothes and ornaments were also slightly lost. The victim was afraid that the bandits would tear up the ticket and did not dare to report the case.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Appeal in Case of Strangling Daughter-in-Law Announced</h3>

After being dissatisfied, they appealed to the province. The High Court summoned witnesses to open the trial many times. Yesterday, the sentence was announced: Xu Chengzhang and Xu Juxin were innocent, and Xu Zhang was still sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Tragedy of Suicide of an Old Woman in Her Seventies</h3>

Xu was old and had no one to rely on, and recruited a son-in-law, Shi, who died this spring, leaving one son and one daughter. Ms. Xu was greatly stimulated and suddenly thought of committing suicide yesterday morning when people were unprepared. She cut her neck with a razor and was sent to the hospital for treatment. Due to her old age and excessive blood loss, she died the next morning.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Massive Amount of Red Pills Intercepted at Ningbo Station</h3>
<p>Luo Shouren, a member of the Jiangbei Joint Military Police Inspection Team of Ningbo Military Police, led soldiers Ruan Kun and others to patrol the Ningbo Railway Station at 6:30 a.m. yesterday (22nd), when they saw a person carrying a burden on his shoulder, looking flustered. He was immediately detained for inspection and found fifty bags of red pills in his blue cloth bag, weighing 25 catties. The man was taken to the team for questioning. According to the report, his name is Yuan Yongguan, and the red pills were given to me by Xu Wenkui, who is on the run.

<h3>Xiaoshan: Collision Sinks Incense Boat, Causing Fatalities</h3>
<p>Near Xiaoshan Xinfadi, an incense boat from Yifeng and a speedboat from Xixing collided on the evening of the 22nd. The incense boat sank immediately, and fourteen male and female pilgrims and four children fell into the water. Fortunately, with the efforts of neighbors, all the male and female pilgrims were rescued. However, the four children were nowhere to be found, and their bodies floated up on the morning of the 23rd. At that time, the speedboat was detained by the local township police. On one side, the Shaoxing County Government and the court were notified to report and accuse the incident.

In this extraordinary time, both labor and management must recognize the importance of mutual dependence and the great responsibility to the entire nation, and make every effort to avoid mistreating workers, undermining their livelihoods, and preventing workers from being lazy or going on strike, so as to avoid endangering social order and destroying the means of mutual survival. Local party branches should provide earnest guidance and protection at all times. In the event of such incidents, they should immediately cooperate with the competent authorities to strictly prevent them. If workers involved in labor unrest are members of trade unions, for the sake of the interests of the nation and the country, they may be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Article 37, Paragraph 3 of the Trade Union Law, so as to quickly quell the unrest. Party branches at all levels and industrial and commercial groups should, at all times, deeply understand each other and plan methods for coordinated progress to avoid fostering incidents and destroying the national foundation."</p>

<h3>Two Groups Aid Wang Yingchun</h3>
<p>Separately Hire Xue Dubi and Four Other Lawyers to Defend Wang Yingchun, an Employee of the Nanjing Road Citizen's Association Xin Xin Company. During the January 28th Incident, Wang Yingchun served in the 19th Route Army as a volunteer soldier. He took home leftover hand grenades without a mechanism as a souvenir. A few days ago, the Xin Xin Company reported the theft of several tins of cigarettes. It was found out that a student was responsible. According to the confession, the cigarettes were hidden in the dormitory. To thoroughly investigate, the company searched the employees' dormitory and unintentionally found the hand grenades, which led to his arrest and detention. After hearing the news, Wang's family asked the Citizens' Association's First District Branch for assistance. The association's standing committee visited the Xin Xin Company at 9:00 a.m. on the 23rd of this month. The company sent Deputy Manager Tang Chengzhang to receive them. The association's representatives stated their intention and inquired whether Wang Yingchun had any improper behavior. If there was no violation of the rules, it would be best if the company could prove that he had no malicious intent, considering his youth and ignorance. Tang said that the company discovered these contraband items because of the theft case, which violated the military regulations, and reporting the case was the company's duty. There was no other intention. Wang's patriotism and service in the army were admirable, and he had done nothing wrong while working in the company. The court would provide honest testimony. The Citizens' Association's First District Branch has convened an emergency meeting and entrusted lawyer Xue Dubi to serve as defense counsel.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Fellow Villagers' Association Held Yesterday for Xin Xin Company Employee</h3>
<p>Regarding the arrest of Wang Yingchun, a native of Wuxi and an employee of the Xin Xin Company, an interim joint meeting was held, chaired by Kuang Zhongmou. Member Ma Shaoquan reported in a letter, stating that Wang Yingchun, a fellow villager, was a young patriot who had worked in the Xin Xin Company in Nanjing for many years. During the January 28th Incident, he participated in the Citizens' Association's volunteer army, which is why he retained two non-dangerous bombs as souvenirs. They were found by the police and prosecuted in the First Special District Court for the crime of endangering public safety under Article 101 of the Criminal Law. He requested assistance from the association. An investigation into Wang Yingchun's past history reveals that he is indeed a patriotic and courageous youth. The association should provide legal aid according to law. The following was resolved: (1) Send a letter to Tang Chengzhang, Deputy Manager of the Xin Xin Company, to inquire about the facts and designate representatives to go for negotiations, requesting that he find a way to bail him out; (2) Designate legal counsel Wang Chuanbi, Lu Dingkui, and Guo Shouyi as three lawyers to attend the next hearing for defense; (3) Send separate letters to the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association to prove that Wang Yingchun participated in the volunteer army during the January 28th Incident, so as to obtain a strong guarantee.</p>
<h3>Chen Gongbo Arrives in Shanghai to Prepare for the Establishment of the Central Machinery Factory; Negotiating Loans with the National Products Bank</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that matters regarding the Ministry of Industry's preparation for the establishment of the Central Machinery Factory</p>
<p>are already underway separately. Personnel have been sent to England to select and purchase machinery, etc., and capital has also been borrowed from the British Boxer Indemnity Fund, amounting to approximately 3 million yuan. However, Minister Chen Gongbo, due to the large amount still lacking, came to Shanghai from Beijing on the morning of the 23rd to negotiate a loan with the National Products Bank. According to the reporter's inquiry, the details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Negotiating a Loan</h3>
<p>Minister Chen Gongbo is sparing no effort in preparing for the establishment of the Central Machinery Factory because the steel plant is already being prepared, and the steel plant is related to the Central Machinery Factory. In terms of capital, approximately 3 million yuan has been borrowed, but there is still a significant difference. Therefore, Chen visited Song Ziliang, General Manager of the National Products Bank, yesterday morning to negotiate a loan for the shortfall. One saying is that the loan will be undertaken by the China Construction Bank Company, which will be established on July 1, but it is understood that progress is quite smooth.</p>
<h3>Factory Site in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Industry borrowed more than 3 million yuan from the British Boxer Indemnity Fund, it sent Ministry employee Lu Jingpu to England to purchase machinery. Lu set off on the 14th of last month and is expected to return to China in four or five months. As for the factory site, it was originally planned for the capital, but now Shanghai has been changed to the commercial and industrial center, so it has been changed to an area around North Suzhou Road in Shanghai. The address can be determined soon. The factory building drawings have also been completed, and construction can begin as soon as the address is completely resolved. It is expected that it can be completed within a year.</p>
<h3>Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant Begins Manufacturing Three Trainer Aircraft</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant is currently manufacturing the Morse-style steel-frame trainer aircraft and the Ninghai No. 2 aircraft.

The date of the flight to South China must also be determined after consulting with Minister Chen. Here, the manufacturing of three trainer aircraft is now beginning. The factory building is scheduled to be completed by the end of August. These three aircraft can then be assembled simultaneously at the new factory site.</p>
<h3>Zhu Changnian Talks About the Situation of Overseas Chinese in Sweden, Norway, and Finland; The Three Countries Have Very Strict Restrictions on Foreigners Entering the Country, So There Are Very Few Overseas Chinese in Those Countries</h3>
<p>Zhu Changnian, the former ambassador to Sweden, Norway, and Finland, has completed his term and returned to China. He arrived in Shanghai on the Lincoln President passenger ship on the 22nd and is scheduled to enter Beijing in the coming days to report everything to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Central News Agency reporter visited Zhu at his private residence yesterday and inquired about the recent situation of overseas Chinese in Norway and other three countries. He replied that he had been abroad for five years. There were only eight overseas Chinese in Norway because the country's laws stipulate that foreigners are not allowed to engage in business or reside in the country. Therefore, there are very few overseas Chinese in Norway. There are none even Japanese people. Overseas Chinese are naturally no exception. In June of last year, the country's government strictly prohibited foreigners from entering the country. Those who had entered the country before were also required to leave the country. He immediately visited the government's foreign affairs authorities to negotiate. As a result, the overseas Chinese were allowed to postpone their departure for one year, and after further negotiations, they were allowed to reside permanently. However, the overseas Chinese in Norway are all small business owners and have no power to develop. As for the overseas Chinese in Finland, there are more than 50 people, and there are about 10 people in Sweden, and the situation is similar. Sweden, Norway, and Finland all have small land areas and dense populations, so the law does not allow foreigners to enter the country for trade. As for the attitude of the three countries towards China, they all express goodwill.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance has consulted with the provincial and municipal governments that the National Financial Conference has decided to abolish the harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies of various provinces and reduce the additional surcharges on land taxes, and use the income of the Stamp and Tobacco Alcohol Bureaus to compensate for the insufficient local income of various provinces after reducing the additional surcharges on land taxes. They are ordered to take over and handle it from July 1 and order the finance departments of various provinces and cities and the Stamp and Tobacco Alcohol Tax Bureaus to close the case by June 30. However, even if there are reforms in general administration, merchants must still affix stamps as usual and must not hesitate to wait and see. The Ministry of Finance yesterday ordered the Stamp and Tobacco Alcohol Tax Bureau of this city to comply. The original text reads, "In the National Financial Conference, regarding the abolition of additional surcharges on land taxes, the central government is separately planning to compensate for the insufficient local expenses. Regarding the proposal to allocate a certain percentage of the stamp revenue under the national tax to the local governments at all levels to compensate for the reduction of land taxes and additional surcharges, the Ministry is now preparing to collect and distribute them uniformly in accordance with the original plan. As for any reforms to stamp duties in the future, they are purely administrative issues, and there is no change in the regulations and tax rates. Merchants must not take the opportunity to wait and see. The Bureau should inform its subordinates to inform the merchants not to misunderstand and should still affix stamps in accordance with the regulations to avoid being found and punished. This order is hereby issued."</p>

<h3>Anglo-American Tobacco Factory Labor Strike Stalemated; Scheduled to Host People from All Walks of Life to Organize a Support Association</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the Anglo-American tobacco factory labor strike has been deadlocked for a month and is difficult to resolve. The strike committee is scheduled to host people from all walks of life to discuss the organization of a support association. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>All Out; After the Anglo-American Tobacco Factory Labor Strike, the Labor Side</h3>
<p>To prevent the company from recruiting new workers to work in the factory, a maintenance team and a propaganda team have been organized to monitor day and night near the new and old factories in Pudong. The strike committee recently heard that the company felt that the production was insufficient to meet the needs of the market, so the Yangshupu No. 3 factory was changed to a six-day work week. However, the tin foil and tin paper in the tin packing room were insufficient, and it was still difficult to increase production. The Pudong new and old factories have a large number of tin paper in stock, so it is planned to recruit a large number of workers to transport it today (Monday) morning. After hearing this, the strike committee convened a meeting of all members of the maintenance team and propaganda team yesterday afternoon and decided to depart at 4:00 a.m. today to strictly prevent it near the dock, and notify all workers to help take care of it at the dock in case of emergency.</p>
<h3>Organizing a Support Association; The strike committee, because it believes that this</h3>
<p>Dispute will be difficult to resolve in a short period of time. To strengthen the forces, it has decided to imitate the methods of the National Tax Strike in 1927 and invite industrial, commercial, and academic groups in this city to a meeting on the 27th of this month to request the organization of a support association to seek long-term resistance and achieve final victory.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Submits a Request to the Executive Yuan to Promote Domestically Produced Writing Instruments</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a request to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to promote domestically produced writing instruments. The original text stated: "Regarding the submission of a request, the association held its fifth member congress on June 17th. According to the request submitted by the Pen and Ink Trade Association to the government, urging the issuance of orders to all national institutions, schools, and organizations to uniformly adopt domestically produced writing brushes and Chinese ink, it is stated that since the rise of education in our country, imported fountain pens, ink, pencils, etc., have been largely adopted, leading to a decrease of nearly sixty percent in the annual sales of domestically produced writing instruments. Recently, fountain pens have become extremely popular, and people across the country adorn their chests with one as an embellishment, causing the pen and ink industry, the only remaining national treasure of our thousands of years of history, to decline to the point of collapse. If no remedies are sought, it will be difficult to survive. Now, we specifically lay out the declining situation of our industry and request that it be submitted to the general assembly for resolution and forwarded to the government for approval and relief. We urge all institutions, schools, and organizations to uniformly adopt domestically produced writing brushes and Chinese ink, and any use of imported products will not be recognized, in order to promote and protect our national essence. This matter was submitted to the general assembly for discussion and was recognized that for schools and organizations to handle affairs, except for a small number of special drawings that cannot avoid using imported writing instruments, the use of domestically produced writing instruments for other documents and books is actually extremely convenient. However, the general custom is to pursue trends, causing domestically produced writing instruments to decline day by day, which is truly lamentable. As the saying goes, 'When the wind blows, the grass bends.' Public institutions are already like this, so how can we expect the people to promote domestic goods? It is truly heading in the opposite direction. It is appropriate to use the power of the government to correct this declining trend. The original proposal stated that the use of imported products will not be recognized. For lower-level government offices forwarding documents to supervising authorities and schools receiving students' test papers, it seems that clear standards can be set. All writings that could use domestically produced writing instruments but instead use imported ones should be returned and rewritten. If this is strictly enforced, the atmosphere can be drastically changed within just a few months. It was resolved that this matter should be forwarded to the relevant departments and ministries in accordance with this spirit. It is appropriate to record this case and submit it for review and approval, to uniformly implement it, which is truly in the public interest," etc.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Submits a Request to the Executive Yuan to Abolish Cured Meat Inspection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to abolish cured meat inspection, stating: "Regarding the submission of a request, the case investigates the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's implementation of the cured meat and ham inspection. After it had already been abolished by order of the Executive Yuan, it was re-implemented. The association had legally submitted a request to your esteemed Yuan to abolish it. Subsequently, in May of the 23rd year, we received Instruction No. 17565 from the Ministry of Industry, stating that the Executive Yuan had already approved the Cured Meat and Ham Association's request, allowing the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau to temporarily conduct the inspection before the Ministry of Industry had established methods for inspecting domestic goods, and reducing the inspection fee to one dime per hundred catties, etc. Since then, the two associations have repeatedly stated that Articles 2 and 8 of the Commodity Inspection Law do not provide for any exceptions allowing temporary municipal implementation before the Ministry acts. They argued that the Executive Yuan's order inevitably abandons the fundamental purpose of legislation and accommodates the accomplished fact, and they strongly requested its abolition. The association forwarded these requests to your esteemed Yuan for review on May, September of the 22nd year, and January 8th and February 7th of this year. None of these requests were approved. On March 1st of this year, the two associations again urged us to forward a telegram to your esteemed Yuan. Only on March 14th did we receive Instruction No. 103 from your esteemed Yuan, stating, 'The telegram has been noted and forwarded to the Ministry of Industry for review and response,' etc. This dispute has already lasted for over a year. Even if it has been forwarded to the Ministry for review, it has been over three months, and we have not received any information on how it has been reviewed. The two associations frequently inquire, making it difficult to answer. Upon investigation, the ham and cured meat inspection in this city, which was abolished and then re-implemented, was presided over by your esteemed Yuan and was not due to the Ministry's review. Therefore, regarding the matters raised in the association's previous telegrams, if your esteemed Yuan adopts them, procedurally, it seems unnecessary to go through the review process again. Upon investigation, the reason your esteemed Yuan approved this inspection was to develop the industry's trade and improve public health. In reality, ham and cured meat are high-quality side dishes in our country and have long enjoyed a good reputation. At this recent exhibition of products along the railway line, the hams sent by the southern province and sold at the exhibition site had not been inspected beforehand, and the facts show that thousands were sold out in a single day, demonstrating that these products have long been trusted by the public. Domestic trade is different from foreign trade. The volume of consumption purely depends on the wealth and poverty of society and does not rely on the power of inspection to attract customers. There are countless types of food consumed domestically. To say that ham, which is known for its finely processed and famous products, cannot guarantee public health without inspection, then how will the various other foods be handled? Why are they all granted exceptions? This is why the two industries believe that this measure is not necessary, hinders trade, and may not develop business. They unanimously appeal for an early cessation of the inspection. The local authorities in this city have always been considerate of commercial sentiment. For example, the suspension of the banquet tax and the delayed discussion of the business tax both demonstrate an understanding of public opinion and adherence to the overall situation. Since the implementation of this inspection measure, the requests made by the two industries have all been based on actual circumstances, which the municipal authorities have gradually become aware of. If your esteemed Yuan could persuade them with commercial considerations to revoke the previous proposal, the local government would not insist on it. Considering the hesitation and prudence of your esteemed Yuan, we dare to offer our humble opinion. On June 17th of this year, the association will convene its fifth member congress. The two associations believe that this case has been pending for many years and was not resolved during the term of the first executive committee of the association. They appealed to us with righteousness, urging the association to resolve it and submit a special proposal. We have informed them that the executive committee also attaches great importance to this case, believing that it relates to the future of the industry. We have already submitted a motion, and the public sentiment has gradually understood. We will submit this case to the general assembly for discussion and resolution to continue to request the revocation of the original inspection case. It is appropriate to record this case and submit it for review and approval, to handle it as requested, which is truly in the public interest," etc.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Submits a Request to the Legislative Yuan to Expand the Number of Committee Members and Amend Article 18 of the Chamber of Commerce Law</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a request to the Legislative Yuan, stating: "Regarding the submission of a request, the association held its fifth member congress on June 17th. According to the proposal by Executive Committee Member Wang Yansong, requesting that the government be asked to increase the number of executive and supervisory committee members of the Chamber of Commerce, it is stated that Article 18 of the current Chamber of Commerce Law stipulates that the number of executive committee members shall not exceed fifteen and the number of supervisory committee members shall not exceed seven. Therefore, all provincial chambers of commerce, federations of chambers of commerce, independent municipal chambers of commerce, and county chambers of commerce as referred to in Article 5 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, or districts and towns, are subject to the same limit of fifteen and seven members, respectively. There is no distinction in the number of members. This is significantly different from the two types of chambers of commerce stipulated in the Chamber of Commerce Law of the fourth year of the Republic, one with thirty to sixty members and the other with fifteen to thirty members, allowing for flexibility based on local conditions. Since its implementation, there have been many obstacles. Given the situation of 187 industries in this city, it is impossible to expect twenty-two executive and supervisory committee members to be thoroughly familiar with everything. It is proposed to ask the Legislative Yuan to amend the law to increase the number of executive committee members of provincial chambers of commerce, federations of chambers of commerce, and independent municipal chambers of commerce to twenty-seven and the number of supervisory committee members to eleven, in order to gather more ideas, cooperate on division of labor, and further advance the work of the chamber. We request a public decision on this matter," etc. After discussion at the general assembly, it was recognized that the obstacles described in the proposal have been felt by all members since the implementation of the current regulations. It was resolved that the Legislative Yuan should be requested to amend Article 18 of the Chamber of Commerce Law to increase the number of executive committee members of provincial chambers of commerce, federations of chambers of commerce, and independent municipal chambers of commerce to twenty-seven and the number of supervisory committee members to eleven. It is appropriate to record this case and submit it to your esteemed Yuan for review and approval, to amend and implement it. Respectfully submitted to the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3>Discrepancy in Aluminum Utensil Freight Rates on Two Railway Lines: Federation of Machine-Made Goods Received Ministry Order, Due to Error by Personnel on Shanghai-Hangzhou Line</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Machine-Made Domestic Goods Factories submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways regarding the discrepancy in freight rates for steel utensils on the Beijing-Shanghai line, which were higher than those on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line. The Ministry of Railways replied yesterday, stating: "Regarding the submitted document regarding the freight rates for steel utensils manufactured by member factories of the federation, shipped from Shanghai to Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, which are calculated based on the third-class commodity rate per kilogram, while shipments to Beijing on the Beijing-Shanghai line are calculated based on the second-class commodity rate per meter, resulting in a discrepancy in charges between the two lines, please correct this issue. We have received and reviewed the submission. Upon investigation by the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, it has been reported that steel utensils, which are aluminum utensils, are classified as second-class commodities in the general commodity classification table, and the Beijing-Shanghai line stations have been charging according to the lead utensil rate, which is not an error. Regarding the federation's claim that the Shanghai-Hangzhou line calculated the rate based on the third-class commodity rate on March 23rd, it has been verified that the two shipments on that day were reported for shipment at the Shanghai South Station, and the freight bill number was 2403. The handling freight personnel at the time did not find any regulations for steel utensils in the commodity classification table and were unaware that they were aluminum utensils. They mistakenly believed that steel utensils were similar to lead utensils and white iron utensils, resulting in the third-class rate being charged. Instructions have been issued to correct this and retroactively collect the freight difference according to regulations. The employee responsible for this error has been severely disciplined to serve as a warning. Furthermore, regarding the previous request by the federation to change the rate for domestically produced steel utensils to the third-class rate, the ministry order is still feasible, and instructions have been issued to separately correct the domestic goods transportation certificate, etc. After this office sent a letter to the federation requesting them to review and handle the matter, we have not received a reply despite repeated reminders. We are hereby jointly clarifying the situation. As for the domestic goods transportation certificate proposed by the federation, please continue to follow the previous case, separately correct it, and submit it to the bureau for forwarding to the ministry for verification." This instruction was issued on June 22nd of the 23rd year of the Republic of China by Minister Gu Mengyu.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Lowers Freight Rates for Ordinary Cotton Yarn Bolts</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway charges for ordinary cotton yarn bolts according to the fourth-class commodity rate, minus 10 percent. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway charges according to the fourth-class commodity rate, plus 60 percent for shipments less than a full carload, and the Ningbo-Cao'e section charges plus 40 percent. Recently, the San You Industrial Company requested that the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway lower its freight rates, as the difference between the two railways was too significant. In order to encourage the sale of domestic goods, the bureau requested the Ministry of Railways to abolish the special rate for ordinary cotton yarn bolts on the line and uniformly calculate the rate according to the fourth-class commodity rate. However, this is limited to merchants who report shipments with a certificate from the Chinese Cotton Mill Association. Those who report shipments without a certificate should establish a separate special rate and report it to the bureau. The bureau has already instructed the transportation department to comply.</p>
<h3>Special District Office of the Rickshaw Industry Refutes the Explanations of the Management Committee, Defending Each Point Based on the Association's Report, Hoping that All Sectors Will Uphold Justice and Provide Close Criticism</h3>
<p>The Xinxin News Agency reports that the Special District Office of the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association yesterday released a refutation of the explanations of the Municipal Council Rickshaw Management Committee to reporters from the Xinxin News Agency. The text stated: "Having read the Municipal Council Rickshaw Committee's report on the improvement plan, seeking fair criticism from the citizens, we find that it is all superficial, embellished, and sensational, which we cannot remain silent about. We now refute each point of the committee's report as follows:"</p>
<h3>Management Committee</h3>
<p>"The establishment of the committee last year was due to the dissatisfaction of a few foreigners with the current rickshaws, who exaggerated the situation to the Municipal Council and requested the formation of the committee. The committee members, including Massey, Zhu Maocheng, and five others, conducted investigations. However, they completely ignored the thorough statements of the rickshaw owners, relying solely on incomplete and inaccurate information, which they considered accurate. They rashly proposed reform measures in sixteen articles. The first three articles proposed unreasonable demands, intending to withdraw 2,000 of the original 10,000 licenses each year, starting from January 1st of next year, and issue them to unrelated individuals to form a new company. This was subsequently shelved by the board of directors. The remaining thirteen articles are all alarmist and were passed through deception. In May of this year, the committee was renamed the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, but all the members remained the same, including Massey and Zhu Maocheng. All the measures proposed are impossible to implement. We will now explain this in detail:"</p>
<h3>Improved Rickshaw Design</h3>
<p>"Regarding the unsuitability of the improved rickshaw design: (1) The committee did not consult with the rickshaw owners beforehand. Suddenly, on May 29th, it issued a notice ordering all rickshaw owners to replace any old rickshaws with the standard design starting immediately, or else they would not be granted licenses, acting with lightning speed. (2) All the practical and useful improved rickshaw designs contributed by the rickshaw owners were rejected. Instead, they want to completely discard the existing and reserved rickshaws and manufacture the most extravagant and uneconomical rickshaws similar to private cars as the standard. Yet, the report claims to aim for economy, lightness, durability, and comfort, which is contradictory. The current rickshaws are already light and comfortable. Moreover, durability requires solid materials, which contradicts the claim of lightness. Their words and actions are inconsistent, and their attempt to gloss over the situation is evident."</p>
<h3>Reduced Rickshaw Rental</h3>
<p>"Regarding the unsuitability of the reduced rickshaw rental: (1) In addition to the cost of the rickshaw, all recurring maintenance expenses, verification fees, repairs, and accidental incidents require an average of five days of downtime per month. Adding the contractor's remuneration and the exchange loss between silver dollars and small silver coins, the monthly profit is less than three yuan. In March of this year, the association submitted the business forms to the Municipal Council for review. However, the committee did not investigate in detail. The report even contains the sensational statement that all the earnings of the rickshaw pullers are extorted by the rickshaw owners. This is an injustice to the rickshaw owners and a gross misrepresentation of the facts. (2) The wages of all laborers are regulated. However, the rickshaw fares earned by the rickshaw pullers, after deducting the rental, are entirely their own. Their income varies depending on their diligence and laziness, and their living conditions also differ accordingly. Moreover, there are no fewer than 40,000 rickshaw pullers in the special district. The committee's report, based on a survey of the earnings of 50 rickshaw pullers, concludes that all their lives are equally miserable, while completely neglecting the rickshaw owners' situation. This is a failure to conduct a thorough investigation. They have even stipulated that the daily rickshaw rental will be reduced to ten small silver coins in August of this year and eight small silver coins in January of next year, directly making it impossible for the rickshaw owners' businesses to survive and cutting off their livelihoods. Yet, they say that gradually reducing the rental is purely for the sake of the rickshaw owners. Who would believe this?"</p>
<h3>Aid to Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>"Regarding aid to rickshaw pullers, the association has already collected 50,000 yuan and entrusted it to prominent figures in Shanghai to design and implement a plan, and will raise more funds if necessary. The committee also ordered all rickshaw owners to collect one small silver coin per rickshaw per day from the rickshaw pullers as an aid fund to organize a rickshaw pullers' mutual aid society. It is questionable whether it is appropriate to take from themselves to provide aid. If the rickshaw pullers refuse to pay, the rickshaw owners will still have to pay for it. Moreover, the previous report stated that the aid fund would be managed by the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, but the current report avoids mentioning this matter, vaguely stating that three supervisors will be dispatched by the Municipal Council and representatives from charitable organizations will be invited to conduct the meeting. This is simply to cover up the truth and use the good name of the aid society to secure the position of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee. Its purpose can be imagined."</p>
<h3>Issuance of Licenses</h3>
<p>"Furthermore, the report states that the issuance of licenses to rickshaw pullers is to enhance their dignity and prevent abuse. At first glance, this seems like great benevolence and righteousness. However, the rickshaw pullers are transient. Once they return to their hometowns to farm, those without licenses will not be allowed to pull rickshaws, which will inevitably lead to many rickshaws being idle. Other regulations, such as fixing the rickshaw fare at one small silver coin per ride, two dimes per mile, and six dimes per hour, will directly cause passengers to ride trams and buses, not only failing to improve the lives of rickshaw pullers but also driving them to desperation. Yet, the report states that it will not be enforced. It also says that it will only set standards to prevent disputes over prices between rickshaw pullers and passengers. This kind of rhetoric is contradictory and incomprehensible. They have already called on rickshaw owners to obtain licenses, or else they will not be given licenses. It is clear that they are forcing rickshaw owners to comply with the above harsh terms. In short, all the plans are impossible to implement and are the worst possible measures. Yet, they shamelessly claim to be seeking improvements in all aspects, embellishing the matter to deceive the citizens. The facts are all there. Who are they trying to deceive? At this critical moment of survival for the rickshaw industry, the rickshaw owners are urgently and vehemently protesting. They have no choice but to refute the committee's report point by point to solemnly declare their position. We earnestly request all organizations, legal entities, trade associations, and people from all sectors of society to uphold justice and provide critical criticism to prevent the rickshaw industry from suffering significant damage and being on the verge of bankruptcy. This would be fortunate indeed."</p>
<h3>The New Shuntian Steamer Sailed to Qingdao and Tianjin Yesterday as Usual; Passengers Must Have a Guarantor to Purchase Tickets</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Steamship Company's New Shuntian steamer, after escaping from pirates, arrived in Shanghai and sailed to Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Tianjin yesterday morning at 12:00 as usual. However, all passengers must have a guarantor to purchase tickets, or else they will be refused.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders Maritime Affairs Bureau to Strictly Inspect Seamen to Ensure Navigation Safety</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau and the Shipping Association received instructions from the Ministry of Communications, stating: "The Provisional Regulations for the Inspection of Seamen on Ships Under 50 Gross Tons were promulgated on April 9th and circulated for implementation. Article 14 of the regulations stipulates that seamen without certificates should apply for inspection within six months from the date of promulgation of these regulations. It has been over two months since the date of promulgation, but no applications for inspection from veteran seamen on small steamers have been received. The remaining four-month deadline will pass quickly. Those who do not have certificates by then should immediately cease serving on ships. Therefore, we issue this notice again, urging everyone to comply and apply for inspection within the deadline. Do not delay and mislead yourselves. Be sure of this order."</p>

<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Establishes Infectious Disease Hospital with Notable Results; Diphtheria is the Most Common Disease Treated, with a Mortality Rate of About 16 Percent! Further Expansion Will Be Considered After the New Building is Completed!</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, recognizing that the lack of a complete infectious disease hospital within the administrative area of the municipal government is a shortcoming in municipal construction, planned to raise funds amidst the city's extreme difficulties and reached an agreement with the China Public Hospital in Zhabei to reorganize as a municipal infectious disease hospital. The establishment process and current status are described below:</p>
<h3>Establishment Process</h3>
<p>Because the establishment of an infectious disease hospital could not be delayed for a moment, the Municipal Health Bureau immediately reached an agreement with the China Public Hospital in Zhabei to construct a new building on the vacant land after it was destroyed in the January 28th Incident. The bureau then appointed Wu Liguo, head of the bureau's Second Section, as the hospital director and hired Lu Jianxin and two others as resident physicians, along with over ten nurses including Sui Baohua. On March 10th of this year, the hospital began admitting patients in the existing buildings, expanding the content and equipment compared to before, charging low fees, and even offering full exemptions for the extremely poor.</p>
<h3>Number of Patients Admitted</h3>
<p>The hospital has been open for three months, and it has been very crowded, especially in April. As of the end of May, the hospital has admitted 227 patients, with diphtheria being the most common, followed by scarlet fever, and then smallpox. Meningitis was less common.</p>
<h3>Causes of Death</h3>
<p>The hospital's mortality rate is approximately 16 percent. The cause of death is mostly due to delayed treatment. Patients did not seek medical attention when they first became ill. Once they knew they had an infectious disease, they hesitated to seek treatment at an infectious disease hospital, fearing it, and only sought medical attention when their condition became critical. However, it was too late. According to the person in charge of the hospital, there were cases where entire families, both young and old, were hospitalized for infectious diseases. When asked why this happened, they said that they initially thought it was insignificant, and by the time the whole family was infected, there was no way to think about it. It is probably because the citizens lack basic medical knowledge and the level of education is childish.</p>
<h3>Current Plans for Expansion</h3>
<p>The patients admitted to the hospital are only a small portion of the citizens suffering from infectious diseases. Many others die without treatment or spread the disease as a result. Because the current buildings are insufficient, the hospital only admits patients with seven types of infectious diseases: diphtheria, scarlet fever, smallpox, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, typhus, typhoid fever, plague, and cholera. Further expansion to include a wider range of infectious diseases will be considered after the new building is completed.</p>
<h3>Memorial Monument for Police Officers Who Died in the Line of Duty to Be Unveiled Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM in Zhabei Baoshan Road; Orders Issued for Ten Officers from Each District and Precinct to Participate; Shanghai Public Security Bureau Erects Memorial Monument for Police Officers Who Died in the Line of Duty, Preparations Completed; Unveiling Ceremony Scheduled for Tomorrow Morning (26th) at 10:00 AM on Baoshan Road in Zhabei; Director Wen Hongen has ordered the Police Corps of the Bureau to dispatch 50 armed police officers to maintain order and also ordered each district and precinct in Nanshi and Zhabei to send 10 unarmed police officers as representatives to participate; They are to be notified immediately to comply; It is reported that Liang Fuchu, the district director of the Fifth District, has temporarily assigned several officers to the scene to maintain traffic order.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying's Opinion on the Construction of Huangshan: Will Never Allow the Natural Scenery to Be Damaged</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, a standing committee member of the Huangshan Construction Committee, recently received a letter from Cheng Linsheng and Wu Yinhuai, chairmen of the Shexian Native Place Association in Shanghai, stating that the development of Huangshan and the construction of a prosperous market are urgent and important tasks. However, Huangshan is a natural wonder and does not require artificial embellishment. The buildings in the mountains should be viewed as regulations, and efforts should be made to preserve the original scenery. They offered their humble opinions at the beginning of the development, etc. After reading the letter, Xu Shiying agreed with the honest opinions of Cheng and Wu and decided that he would never allow the natural scenery to be damaged. He sent a letter in reply yesterday. Xu Shiying's reply is recorded below: "Mr. Linsheng and Mr. Yinhuai, I have received your letter and listened to your honest opinions with great respect and delay. Huangshan is a famous scenic spot in the world. The most important thing for the provincial government to do in establishing a special committee for construction is to protect the original scenery. My views coincide with yours. At the Huining Native Place Association meeting a few days ago, my speech emphasized the preservation of the scenery as the main goal of construction. In the future, I will make suggestions to the association at any time to implement this idea. In the future, the buildings in the mountains should adhere to the principles of simplicity, elegance, and solidity, and should be reviewed in advance. Separate zones should be designated for residential areas. I will never allow the true scenery of nature to be damaged. However, this matter is of great importance and requires gathering ideas from all parties. I respectfully hope that you and the gentlemen of your hometown will provide guidance from time to time to facilitate progress. I am extremely grateful. I reply specifically and wish you peace. Sincerely, Xu Zhishi Ying."</p>
<h3>Rising Gasoline Prices: Ministry of Industry Plans to Develop Oil Fields</h3>
<p>Plans Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Review</p>
<p>Since the coal oil market in our country has been actively competed for by British, American, and Russian oil companies, the trade situation has entered a chaotic state. The companies have suffered heavy losses over the years. Later, they negotiated to unite, and oil prices gradually rose. The oil fields in Sichuan Province in our country are extremely rich in reserves. The Ministry of Industry is aware of this and plans to adopt methods for mining in order to resist them. The recent surge in gasoline prices is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Rising Prices Show No Sign of Stopping</h3>
<p>According to news from the coal oil industry in this city, the Texaco, Mobil, Youbiandi, and Asiatic oil companies in China, in order to recover previous losses, have not only raised the price of coal oil to 7 yuan and 7 jiao per ten gallons on the 19th of this month, but also raised the price of gasoline to 8 yuan and 1 jiao per ten gallons yesterday, an increase of 1 jiao from the previous price. They plan to continue to raise prices as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Pays Attention to Developing Oil Fields</h3>
<p>According to news from the industrial sector, the Ministry of Industry has recently paid close attention to the excessive competition and surplus coal oil sales by foreign oil companies. Currently, in order to achieve self-sufficiency, it plans to designate the oil fields in Fushun County and Rong County in Sichuan Province as state-owned mining areas and has submitted various excavation plans to the Executive Yuan for record. Once approved, it plans to hire mining talents to start excavation immediately.</p>
<h3>Murderer of Lawyer Luo Zhaoxin Identified</h3>
<p>The Deed Was Done by Gangster Zhang Chunbao</p>
<p>Lawyer Luo Zhaoxin was shot and assassinated on the evening of the 20th of this month near his residence in Qinghefang Lane, Guangdong Road and Zhejiang Road. He was shot in the back of the head and died on the spot. The murderer escaped without a trace. Details were reported in this newspaper. Since the incident, the police have taken it very seriously, ordering detectives to do their best to investigate. Unexpectedly, the deceased's son suddenly received a tip the other day, stating that the person who killed Luo was Zhang Chunbao, a well-known gangster living on Rue Pére Robert. Luo's son immediately reported the information to the Public Concession Police, who, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession, went to arrest him at his address. However, Zhang had already heard the news and fled far away, and the search yielded nothing. The police are now sending out detectives in all directions, determined to arrest him for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Ordered to Strictly Suppress Potent Narcotics, Many Posters Displayed Throughout the City</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Commissioner, Wen Hong'en, has received an order from the Garrison Headquarters to investigate and prohibit potent narcotics such as morphine and red pills. Yesterday, he specifically ordered the various district offices to conduct strict investigations and also to put up posters. The original text is as follows: "Case received from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, General Order No. 0402, which states, 'The Chairman Chiang has repeatedly ordered the investigation and prohibition of potent narcotics such as morphine and red pills. Now, in order to make the public aware, five sets of posters have been printed and posted on thoroughfares so that every household knows and women and children are aware, so as to avoid violating criminal laws and falling into the legal net. The relevant posters, 900 sheets per set, should be inspected and distributed, and you should properly allocate and distribute them to the police stations in each district for posting. This is essential.' A total of 4,500 posters have been issued. In addition to separate orders, the posters should be inspected and distributed, and the police should be ordered to post them uniformly by the 24th of this month. There must be no delay. This order.'"</p>
<h3>Retrial of the Liang Chengyu Case, Delayed for Three Years, The Supreme Court Has Rejected the Appeal, Still Tried by Judge Wu Tingqi</h3>
<p>Liang Chengyu, a native of Shandong, was the No. 2 Chinese detective of the former General Inspectorate of the Police. Previously, he was involved in a morphine robbery case. The police detained Liang and sent him to court, where he was sentenced to seven years in prison. Later, it was found that Liang was also the leader in two cases: the armed kidnapping of Chen Shifan on the evening of December 19th, 1920, and the kidnapping of Li Huiqing at 1 a.m. on August 8th, 1921. The police filed additional charges against Detective Liang. After trial, Liang was sentenced to death. When the case was submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for review, it was found that there were still doubts about Liang's involvement in the two kidnapping cases, and the case was sent back to the First Special District Court for retrial. Judge Wu Tingqi conducted a new trial, and several court sessions were held for interrogation. However, Liang suddenly filed a request for Judge Wu to recuse himself, which delayed the case. After many twists and turns, it has been nearly three years and a final verdict has not been reached. Now, the Supreme Court has rejected Liang's request, so the case was continued in the Eighth Criminal Court by Judge Wu Tingqi on the afternoon of the previous day. First, the police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the police were prosecuting the defendant Liang Chengyu for the crime of kidnapping and demanding ransom under Article 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. In the first instance on September 4, 1921, Liang was sentenced to death. Later, the Provincial Government sent the case back for retrial, and Liang filed a petition requesting the judge's recusal, which was rejected. Liang still refused to accept this and appealed. The Supreme Court has now rejected the appeal, so the trial is continuing today. However, the evidence presented by the police is the same as in the first instance, and it has been recorded in the minutes for investigation. When Liang Chengyu was questioned, he firmly denied the two cases against him, saying that he was falsely accused by Fang Liansheng and Lu A'gen, and he intentionally attacked and insulted the Chinese and Western detectives who handled the case for the police. Judge Wu stated that the case was clear and ordered the debate to begin. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang and the defendant's agent, Ma Shouhua, debated for a long time. The court ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and the judgment will be announced on the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Assassination on Kangqu Road Last Night, The Deceased's Name is Lu A'san</h3>
<p>Xing Yujun, a policeman from Post No. 47 of the Second District Police Station on Ninghui Road, brought a reporter last night who said, "Wang Zhigang, who lives at No. 8 Hexing Lane on Kangqu Road, came to the station to report that at about 9:30 p.m. tonight (the 24th), a person suddenly fled from outside, went to the attic of his house, and kept shouting for help. He immediately went forward to check and found that the person was unable to speak. After examination, it was found that his left breast was bleeding profusely, with a bullet wound, and he died of serious injuries. The person was wearing a blue cloth uniform, a white suit shirt, white socks, and leather shoes." The station chief immediately went to investigate. According to people near the area, someone fired a gun in the Kangqu Road No. 369 teahouse, resulting in an assassination. The deceased's name was Lu A'san, aged thirty-odd. District Chief Li of the Second District questioned him and immediately sent Detective Team Leader Shen Wenda with police officers to investigate the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Orders Strict Prohibition of Fishing Boats Fishing Near Submarine Cables, To Avoid Damage to the Cables and Maintain Transportation, The Bureau of Social Affairs Has Been Ordered to Comply</h3>
<p>The International Telecommunication Bureau stated that submarine cables are often damaged by fishing boats using fishing gear near the cables when fishing, which affects transportation. They specifically requested the Ministry to strictly prohibit this. Now, the Shanghai Fisheries Bureau of Social Affairs has received an order from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, approving the request from the Ministry of Transportation to strictly prohibit fishing boats from anchoring or lowering fishing gear near submarine cables to avoid damage to the cables, etc. It is reported that the bureau, in addition to ordering compliance, will issue a public notice to inform fishermen to avoid this.</p>

Various exhibits were arranged in great detail, with a dazzling array. As for the variety show aspect, various comedy and drama performers, such as Zhang Yizhi and Yi Fangshuo, all came to the venue to perform. Various schools also had drama performances. The drama club of the Youth Propaganda Corps performed "Hygiene and Life" and "May 30th Bloodshed," which had profound implications and were particularly outstanding. The magic tricks performed by Htianlei, with the scenery alone costing 7,000 yuan, meant that the audience on both days filled the hall, with a large number of people who could not get in.</p>

<h3>The National Goods Northwest Touring Exhibition Group: Recent News That Representative Xu Jianruo Has Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The general representative Xu Jianruo of the National Goods Northwest Touring Exhibition Group, organized by the Chinese National Goods Production and Sales Cooperative Association, departed from Shanghai in the middle of last month to negotiate the national goods exhibitions in five places: Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xi'an, and Lanzhou. He has basically completed the negotiations and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning on the Pinghu train at 8 a.m. Those who welcomed him at the station included Zhu Boyuan, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Chen Binghui and Pan Dechun of the Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association; Wang Jian'an and Wang Hanqiang of the National Goods Maintenance Association; Sun Xuxian of the Northwest Question Research Association; Shao Daren, president of the Zhengyi Society; and representatives from Meiya Silk Factory, China Chemical Industry Society, and China Enamel Factory, more than 20 people in total. After Mr. Xu got off the train, he shook hands with the welcomers one by one as a greeting. Mr. Xu briefly described the exhibition as follows: "Kaifeng" Exhibition: Chairman Liu served as the president, and Director Zhang of the Construction Department served as the vice president. The address was the National Goods Market on Nantujie. The venue was spacious and the layout was very thorough. The exhibition period was from the 27th of last month to the 10th of this month, a total of 15 days. The daily audience reached more than 30,000 people, and the situation was exceptionally hot. "Zhengzhou" Exhibition: The organizer was the Zhengzhou China National Goods Company. Commander Jiang of the local Garrison Headquarters, Commissioner Ruan of the Commissioner's Office, Director Qian of the Longhai Railway, and the Chamber of Commerce, legal entity, etc., all did their best to assist. The address was in the Chamber of Commerce. The exhibition period began on the 20th and was originally scheduled to close on the 27th. When I left, there were only three days left, but I heard that the local academic circles requested to extend the exhibition period, and the enthusiasm was generally seen. The Luoyang exhibition is now fully negotiated. The organizers are the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Bai Liangze; the chief director of the Longhai Road, Li; the Commissioner of the Commissioner's Office, Tu; the commander of the 84th Division, Gao; the Party Department, and the legal entity. The address is planned to be in the central cross street of the city south of the city. The layout is that the two old shopping malls temporarily give way for twenty days. The Chamber of Commerce's auditorium and the large living room are about twenty, totaling four, which is a large space, so there is no need to worry about overcrowding. "Xi'an" Exhibition: The scale is even larger. Chairman Shao of the Provincial Government, Director Yang of the Sui Office, and Director Lei of the Construction Department had already sent telegrams of welcome several months ago. All future organizations will be the responsibility of the Construction Department for transportation. The Chamber of Commerce is responsible for arranging the venue, and various expenses will be handled according to Kaifeng, and will be used by the Provincial Government as appropriate. The address has been set as the first public education hall south of the bell tower. The interior of the hall is surrounded by gardens, which is very spacious and quite elegant. It is expected that after the curtain is raised, the results will be better than other places. Lanzhou Exhibition: This is extremely important, but because transportation is blocked and transportation is inconvenient, (the round trip transportation of goods by car takes days). There are still concerns about the time issue. After the closing of Xi'an, it is planned to transport a small number of exquisite products for display. Each factory sends a cadre to take care of it, so as to promote it. It is now heard that Tianshui County, which is in the middle section of Xi'an and Lanzhou, the county magistrate and the Party Department and Chamber of Commerce, etc., sent representatives to request that the exhibition be held for three days when passing through the area, and they are willing to bear all hospitality responsibilities. In short, the Northwest is the ancient capital of our country, rich in products, and has a simple folk customs. In the past, because it was located on the border, the people did not pay much attention to it. Recently, transportation has become more convenient, and wealth has been developed day by day. Foreign goods are everywhere and the market is full of foreign interests. Therefore, the voice of developing the Northwest is getting higher and higher. If we can do our best to transport national goods as much as possible, it may not be a way to block the leak.</p>
<h3>The National Exhibition Will Convene a Review Meeting Within Days</h3>
<p>The National Goods Movement Exhibition organized by the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association has seen a very enthusiastic participation of visitors in recent days. Various factories have also come up with innovative ways to arrange their displays. It is heard that the exhibition will close on the 30th of this month and will not be extended. The association originally had a review committee, and the appointed review committee members are all famous people from the Party and the country, as well as leaders of industry and commerce, who have considerable experience in the products of various factories. Now that the closing date is approaching, the association plans to convene the third review meeting in the next few days to determine the rankings and award prizes separately to show encouragement. The review standards and award levels of the review committee are listed below:</p>
<h3>Review Standards</h3>
<p>The review standards of the association were previously decided by the first meeting of the review committee, and are based on the most recent revised national goods regulations of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, but with slight changes. For example, if a national goods factory has foreign shareholders or uses foreign raw materials completely, it will not only not be recognized as a national goods, but if it is found out, all goods will be detained and fined. Therefore, this year's review is very strict.</p>
<h3>Award Levels</h3>
<p>The awards set by the association are divided into three levels: (1) Special Grade, (2) Excellent Grade, (3) First Grade. Special Grade awards are for completely domestic raw materials and daily necessities, or national defense military supplies, hardware and machinery, etc. Excellent Grade is for daily necessities made entirely of domestic raw materials, etc. First Grade is for imitation foreign products and consumables made of mostly domestic raw materials, etc. It is heard that the association will conduct strict reviews one by one to ensure that awards are given seriously.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Grand Occasion</h3>
<p>Yesterday was a Sunday holiday, and the guests attending the conference were particularly crowded. The total business of the temporary business district was also better than usual. Businesses such as Hefeng Knitting Factory, Huatong Electric Factory, Buddhist Bookstore, Kaiming Cotton Mill, Yonghe Industrial Company, Huang Ruixinzhai, and Xinsheng Underwear Company were all very prosperous. It is heard that in terms of entertainment today, in addition to the famous drama troupe performing patriotic dramas, the Youyi stock of Daxia University will also join the performance.</p>
<h3>Darlong Woolen Mill's Northwest Mobile Exhibition is a Great Success</h3>
<p>Darlong Woolen Mill participated in the Northwest National Goods Mobile Exhibition organized by the Chinese National Goods Production and Sales Cooperative Association. Last month, it went from Shanghai to Bian, first to Kaifeng, then to Zhengzhou. The exhibitions in both places were quite well received. The various kinds of national wool fabrics and serge of the Yangcheng brand produced by the factory are of excellent quality and can compete with imported products. The weather in the north is relatively mild, and there is a particular need for wool products, so people purchased them in large numbers. It is heard that after the Zhengzhou exhibition, it will go to Luoyang for another exhibition, which will probably open on the first of next month.</p>
<h3>Merchant Ships Traveling the Yangtze River Will Be Subject to a River Dredging Navigation Tax. The Principles Have Been Passed by the Yangtze River Consolidation Commission and Will Be Implemented After Approval by the Central Government</h3>
<p>China's Yangtze River shipping has always relied on natural water conservancy, and has not been repaired for a long time, resulting in floods and disasters in recent years, and ships running aground in winter. This reporter learned from the shipping industry that the Yangtze River Waterway Consolidation Committee, which is meeting in Nanjing, has passed three principles for dredging the Yangtze River, and has decided to levy a Yangtze River navigation tax on Chinese and foreign merchant ships to pay for the dredging. That is (1) all merchant ships navigating the Yangtze River using mechanical power shall pay a dredging fee; (2) the fee shall be proportional to the total tonnage and the distance of navigation, calculated at yuan 0.02 per ton for every 100 li (50 kilometers) of navigation. Distances less than 100 kilometers will be counted as 100 kilometers; (3) the funds will be collected by the customs on behalf of the committee, and another management committee will be set up to manage the funds. It has now been reported to the Ministry of Communications for submission to the Executive Yuan for discussion and approval, and then submitted to the Central Political Committee for review. Once approved, it can be implemented. The detailed measures will also be drafted.</p>

<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>As a result, a refund was issued.

<h3>Daye Bank Will Hold an Inaugural Meeting</h3>

The initiators of the bank are either industry magnates or financial experts, and they must have concrete plans and new facilities for their operations to contribute to society. The future development of the business can be expected.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhenhua Telegraphed Xu Shiying and Others to Solicit Donations of Medicines to Relieve the Ill Disaster Victims in Anhui Province, Many Suffering from Summer Diarrhea, Dysentery, Plague, and Malaria</h3>

<h3>Zhabei District Rent Reduction Committee Declaration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, Zhabei District Branch, declares to landlords: A dwelling is a place of mental comfort and shelter from the elements. We value it more than food and clothing. In Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China," Part Three, it is said, "Housing is a source of happiness for mankind, even more so than food and clothing. My plan to develop housing aims to provide affordable housing for the masses." This is Dr. Sun's long-held aspiration. It is not only to make the people's housing beautiful and well-equipped but also to make the rent affordable. It is evident that decades ago, the rent for our people's housing had already become unbearable, causing mental anguish. Therefore, Dr. Sun carefully considered and strived to develop solutions. However, for decades, the nation has been plagued by turmoil, and the affordable housing plan has not been realized. Now, in these turbulent times, we can only struggle to survive, hoping for better days. Unexpectedly, rents have continued to rise, especially in Shanghai, where housing seems to be treated as a commodity. The buildings are narrow and simple, but the rent continues to increase. Taking the Chinese-administered area of northern Shanghai as an example, to rent an ordinary house, even a small one, costs no less than twenty or thirty yuan. Although this rent is already very low, the income of workers and employers is already half taken up by rent, leaving them unable to provide for their families. As a result, multiple families often live in one room. In this hot and humid weather, wives and children are crammed into a corner, with wood shavings and bamboo scraps scattered everywhere. There is a lack of fresh air and space to move around. This hell on earth has become a common situation in the city. Moreover, the bankruptcy of rural areas and the repeated drops in commodity prices in the commercial market have exacerbated the suffering. The environment is becoming increasingly difficult. We cannot live in caves or the wilderness, nor can we easily find other solutions. We have no choice but to patch up our homes to provide shelter from the wind and rain, and to sell our possessions to pay for medical treatment, enduring the pain and delaying the inevitable. Eventually, we run out of options and become outwardly strong but inwardly weak, watching our resources dwindle and our lives fade away. This is why the market has plummeted, and it is the root cause of the difficulties faced by industry and commerce. Considering that the people are the foundation of the nation, and when the foundation is strong, the nation is stable, how can we expect the nation to be stable if the people are not secure during this time of advocating a new way of life? Moreover, those who benefit from manipulating and monopolizing this stage of vast wealth disparity are only a small portion of the landlords. They put the vast majority of citizens in dire straits. This phenomenon is not found in Europe and America, and it is unlikely to be tolerated under the principle of equality. Now, considering the rent reduction in the capital, the cost of living there is much lower than in Shanghai, and their call for fairness has been approved. How can the citizens of Shanghai, who suffered greatly from the January 28th Incident and are barely clinging to life, bear such a heavy burden? Is it not the landlords of Shanghai who are being heartless? Otherwise, the rent reduction movement in Shanghai has been going on for several months. We have been running around and shouting, exhausting our strength and voice, but not only have we not received any benefit, but the landlords have also used their wealth and legal skills to increase the suffering of the tenants. Alas, what have the people of Shanghai done to deserve this? There is no end in sight, and no way to save us. From now on, we can only stand respectfully under the autocratic rule of the landlords, working ourselves to the bone until the end. To those heartless landlords, if you can show some compassion at this time, consider the cause and effect, and act out of a sense of camaraderie, offering a small amount of help to revive us, then the revival of the citizens and the merits of developing society will all come from you. Moreover, a ten percent profit and a good harvest can be expected. If you have no compassion, you will only force us to take desperate measures. If we break the law, you may feel satisfied, but what will happen when the skin is gone and the hair has nothing to cling to? The people's livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult, and the social problems are becoming increasingly serious. Therefore, we can only silently pray to the landlords, urging them to alleviate the unbearable suffering of the citizens, and then everything will be much easier.</p>

<h3>Hooligan Zheng A'gen Detained for Case</h3>
<p>The lame hooligan A'gen, also known as Zheng A'gen, lives in Zhangjia Lane in the city. He specializes in extortion and racketeering with his gang in the city and countryside. He also extorts money from newly opened stores and privately sets up gambling dens and sells drugs. He is guilty of all kinds of evil. Local merchants and residents have suffered greatly. Recently, people have repeatedly filed complaints with the police station. Zheng is well-informed and has been hiding in the concessions. The night before last, he secretly returned home to stay, but unexpectedly, he was discovered by the Second Division of the First District the next morning. Officer Liu ordered a senior policeman to arrest him. Zheng was washing his face when he was arrested and taken to the station for interrogation. He denied everything and was detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Siblings Sue Each Other for Property Division</h3>
<p>Fan Yongqing, a Ningbo native residing at No. 550 Xinyu Lane, Maybark Road, is the adopted son of the late Fan Liansheng. During his lifetime, Liansheng opened the Yuanji tobacco and paper store at the intersection of Beixiguan Road and Kaifeng Road and purchased many shares of the Huacheng Tobacco Company. All of this property is now inherited by Fan Yongqing. Now, Liansheng's biological daughter, who is married to a man surnamed Weng, has hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a lawsuit against Fan Yongqing to divide the property, claiming that the two inherited assets currently managed by Fan Yongqing are worth about 100,000 yuan. According to Article 2 of the Implementation Law of the Inheritance Code, which lists the date on which the inheritance began before the implementation of the Inheritance Code in the Civil Code, a daughter does not have the right to inherit the property of her direct blood relatives. However, according to the laws and regulations before the implementation of the Inheritance Code, a daughter who is loved by her parents should be given a share of the property, but it must be less than the amount divided equally among the number of heirs. If the parents did not express their intentions during their lifetime, and the family council did not discuss giving her a share, the court may consider the circumstances and the status of the inheritance to determine the amount. This is the precedent set by the former Supreme Court and the current Supreme Court. The defendant in this case manages a large inheritance of 100,000 yuan. According to the above laws and regulations, the plaintiff has the right to request a share of the inheritance. Although the plaintiff has repeatedly requested the defendant to give her a share of the inheritance, and the relatives and friends of the plaintiff's deceased father have come forward to mediate, the defendant only agreed to give 3,000 yuan, which is less than 3% of the total inheritance. This is a violation of the law and is obvious. Therefore, the plaintiff requests the court to order the defendant to give her 30,000 yuan of the inheritance. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang of the First Special District Local Court held a hearing and questioned the plaintiff. He advised the two parties, who are siblings, not to litigate and to try to settle the matter out of court. If they cannot reach a settlement, the defendant will be summoned to court on the afternoon of the 29th of this month for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club Grand Opening Yesterday - Exciting Doubles Exhibition - Qiu Fei and Defu Defeat Pan Ka; Wang Wenzheng Wins Against Yu Tianguang</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club, transformed from the Chinese Lawn Tennis Club, officially opened yesterday afternoon and held exhibition matches, with singles and doubles events. As a result, in the singles, Wang Wenzheng defeated Yu Tianguang with scores of 6-3, 6-3. In the doubles, Defu and Qiu Fei defeated Karlsen and Pan Lifei Qu. The excitement of the doubles exhibition was particularly unexpected. Qiu and Defu won 3 to 1, and the tension was constant throughout the match. Yesterday, approximately 500 Chinese and Western guests attended, creating a grand atmosphere. At exactly 3:00 PM, Mayor Wu performed the opening serve, and the competition then began, marking the official establishment of the new Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club. The match details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Wang Wenzheng Defeats Yu Tianguang</h3>
<p>In the opening match, Wang Wenzheng continuously won two sets with scores of 6-3, 6-3, defeating Yu Tianguang. Yu's skills have improved recently, and there was high hope for him to excel, but unexpectedly, he fell short.</p>
<h3>Easy Victory</h3>
<p>Wang served first, Yu won. Wang then won two consecutive games, taking the lead at 2-1. In the next three games, the server won, making the situation very close. Yu tied the score at 2-2 and then 3-3. Subsequently, Wang Wenzheng put in extra effort, winning three consecutive games to win the first set 6-3. In the second set, Yu served first, but Wang Wenzheng again won two games, taking the lead at 4-1. Yu fought hard to regain two games, but Wang won the second set again 6-3.</p>
<h3>Heavy Draws Lead to Victory</h3>
<p>Wang Wenzheng's victory relied entirely on his powerful</p>
<p>heavy draws, sweeping towards both corners, which fatigued Yu. Yu's net play was indeed superior to Wang's, but in yesterday's circumstances, he simply didn't have any opportunities to approach the net. Occasionally, there might have been one or two chances, but they were repelled by Wang's sideline shots. With both players engaging in long baseline rallies, how could Yu not lose?</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng {6-3 6-3} Yu Tianguang</p>
<h3>Qiu and Defu Win Doubles in Thrilling Match</h3>
<p>The doubles match then began. Qiu Fei paired with Defu to face Karlsen and Pan Lifei Qu. Pan and Karlsen's doubles strength was once considered dominant, but as a result, Qiu and Defu defeated them 3 to 1. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Qiu Fei and Defu {3-6 6-3 8-6 6-4} Karlsen and Pan Lifei Qu</p>
<h3>Bold and Decisive</h3>
<p>Yesterday's doubles, except for Qiu Fei who was slightly weaker,</p>
<p>Defu and the other three were all doubles experts. Their fierce smashes, blocks, and net play were astonishing. The bold and decisive action was particularly satisfying. There was absolutely no dragging or hesitation. The back-and-forth of aerial balls was dazzling. Defu's performance in the third and fourth sets was especially breathtaking, often turning hopeless situations into opportunities. The excitement of his performance can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Balanced Situation</h3>
<p>On the court, Defu and Qiu Fei, due to not yet achieving a perfect cooperative state, were initially no match for Karlsen and Pan. Under Karlsen and Pan's intense pressure, they lost five consecutive games and were at a loss. Although they fought hard to regain three games, Pan and Karlsen won the first set 6-3. In the second set, Qiu and Defu had improved their coordination, and thus they retaliated, also gaining a significant advantage at 4-1, and winning back the second set 6-3 at 5-3. Back and forth, the situation seemed balanced.</p>
<h3>Sudden Tension</h3>
<p>The second set was a crucial turning point, the key to victory or defeat, and the situation became tense. Karlsen and Pan once again dominated, leading 3-1 and then 5-1, seemingly holding the power of certain victory. In this extremely dangerous situation, Qiu and Defu suddenly rallied, winning three consecutive games to tie the score at 5-5. In the difficult situation, a glimmer of hope was discovered. Although Karlsen and Pan regained the lead at 6-5, Qiu and Defu won three more games, winning the third set 8-6 and taking a 1-1 lead.</p>
<h3>Defu's Dominance</h3>
<p>After the break, the final decisive fourth set began. Qiu and Defu again won 6-4, thus settling the match 3-1. Defu, in the third set, held up the sky, breaking the stalemate. The victory of the fourth set was also mostly due to Defu. Tall and long-armed, he blocked and smashed everywhere. His steady smashing was key to defeating the enemy. Aided by the steady Qiu Fei, Pan and Karlsen had no chance of survival. The competition became 4-3. Defu won his service game. Pan also won his service game to make it 5-4. Qiu finally won his service game again, ultimately deciding the victory with 6-4.</p>
<p>Chinese Tennis Club Exhibition Match: Xu Chengji Wins Against Little Zheng - Score is Two Sets of 6-2; Doubles: Xu and Liang Defeat Yu and Wang</p>
<p>The Chinese Tennis Club held its fourth exhibition match yesterday. The singles match was between Zheng Zhaojia and Xu Chengji. It was initially expected to be a thrilling battle, but in reality, Zheng Zhaojia's performance was inferior to his previous ones. Xu won two consecutive sets of 6-2. In the doubles, Xu Chengji and Liang Deguang won against Wang Wenzheng and Yu Tianguang by two sets to one. The scores were 2-6, 6-3, 9-7.</p>
<h3>Xu Chengji Defeats Zheng Zhaojia - The Two's Performance is Monotonous</h3>
<p>Lacking in interest, mainly because Zheng Zhaojia was flustered and made numerous errors. Xu Chengji won four consecutive games without much effort. There was only fierce competition in the second game, with the score tied multiple times. After Zheng won two consecutive games, he lost 2-6. In the second set, Zheng still did not improve. Xu won the first game. Zheng managed to get the second game with a slide, but then Xu won four consecutive games, ultimately winning again 6-2.</p>
<h3>Doubles: Xu and Liang Defeat Yu and Wang - Singles Match Finished, Temporary Break</h3>
<p>About a quarter of an hour, Wang Wenzheng and Yu Tianguang arrived after their performance at the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club, and played a doubles match with Xu Chengji and Liang Deguang. Both sides were exhausted</p>
<p>and lacking energy. Liang Deguang remained the same, with little progress. In the first set, Yu and Wang won 6-2. In the second set, Xu Chengji's overhead smashes were on full display, earning a lot of applause, and they won 6-3. In the third set, Wang and Yu initially won three games, holding a considerable advantage, but Xu and Liang were unwilling to be outdone and also won three games. Wang and Yu then won two more games, making it 5-3, thinking it would not be difficult to finish the set, but Xu and Liang actually added three more games in a row, taking the lead at 6-5. Both sides struggled desperately at the crucial moment. After Xu and Liang lost two more games, they finally regained three games, winning the final victory with 9-10. It was truly a match with unpredictable changes.</p>

<h3>Five-Team Athletic Meet Held at Hongkou Park Yesterday ▲Evenly Matched Talent, Fierce Competition ▲Only Recording Achievements, Not Counting Scores</h3>
<p>The five-team athletic meet of Baihong, Post Office Workers, Zhonghua, Huaguang, and Liuxing was held at Hongkou Park yesterday. To promote the fun of sports and encourage up-and-coming athletes, winners of the Far East Games, National Games, International Games, and Shanghai City Games were all barred from competing to conserve energy. However, the results of each event did not suffer as a result. Records of Li Songnian in the 100 meters, Zhu Aixian in the 200 meters, Fu Yuanxiang in the 800 meters, and Pan Gongbao in the 1500 meters were all excellent. If they are given time and put in more effort, they will surely become famous athletes in Shanghai. The shot put, discus, and javelin events were not held due to park regulations. The high hurdles and medium hurdles were stopped due to time constraints, but the remaining events proceeded in order. It is said that this five-team athletic meet will continue to exist forever, and will be held twice a year in the spring and autumn. Therefore, this was actually the first athletic meet, and all records are new records. Furthermore, according to the decision of the representatives of each team, no scores were counted, so there was no champion team. It was highly anticipated that Zhu Hongqi, a member of the Zhonghua team who was expected to set a new record of 11.5 seconds in the 100 meters at the City Junior Games, would emulate Liu Changchun by conserving energy, but he did not compete, which greatly disappointed the audience.

<h3>Shanghai Lacks Centralized Training Location for Summer Military Training</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education and the Training Supervision Department stipulated the implementation of summer military training measures for schools above the senior high school level, students from schools above the senior high school level in this city should receive three weeks of extremely strict military training this summer. Details have already been reported in various newspapers. Now, the City Education Bureau has forwarded the measures to the City National Military Affairs Training Committee for active preparation and planned implementation. According to the Shanghai Society, there are approximately 7,000 people, but there are no suitable large barracks to provide three weeks of military training. The municipal government and educational authorities discussed this matter this spring and planned to convert the original arsenal at Gaochang Temple into barracks for school military training, but the proposal was abandoned because it did not receive permission from the Ministry of Military Affairs. Now that summer is approaching and military training is about to be implemented, the decision is to use a regional approach, designating schools or public venues as temporary barracks. There are also not enough military training instructors to be distributed, so it is still necessary to consult the Training Supervision Department and plan measures together with the Garrison Headquarters. Other matters such as student meals and funding also need to be discussed.</p>
<h3>Graduation Ceremonies at Various Schools ▲Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts is the first art institution in our country. For 23 years, it has been painstakingly managed and continuously striving, greatly influencing the new culture of our country. The 43rd Exhibition of Works by Teachers and Students of the school and the Exhibition of Modern Masterpieces of Calligraphy and Painting will open today. The richness of the exhibits and the magnificence and orderliness of the arrangement are the best of the current painting exhibitions. The new 14th graduation ceremony will also be held at Art Hall at 10:00 AM today. Prior to this, Chairman Cai Yuanpei and acting principal Wang Jiyuan distributed invitations, inviting all sectors to participate. The contents of the two exhibitions are briefly recorded below:</p>

<h3>Two Rivers Women's Physical Education Teachers</h3>
<p>The graduation ceremony for the 15th graduating class of the Jiangwan Two Rivers Women's Physical Education Normal School was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. The venue, the school's auditorium, was beautifully decorated, resplendent and colorful. Even the smallest details, such as the window curtains and tablecloths, possessed aesthetic appeal. Guests included Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Mrs. Zheng Wei, President of the Women's Temperance Association, female lawyer Lin Kecong, Ou Jiancheng, Manager of Jiande Bank, Chen Binggang, Comprador of Lixing Foreign Firm, Bian Yuying, Manager of Huawei Company, as well as school board members, faculty, alumni, and approximately 500 student family members. The 45 graduates, including Li Fu'ai, each wearing a white silk cheongsam and holding a bouquet of fresh flowers, entered the auditorium in an orderly fashion, exhibiting a solemn and glorious presence, performing the ceremony according to protocol. Director Pan presented diplomas and awards, and delivered a speech that lasted for an hour. The main points of Mr. Pan's speech were threefold: (1) The importance of women's physical education and a healthy nation. There are very few physical education schools established by the central and local governments, like stars at dawn. Mr. Pan stated that he would fulfill his responsibility to guide and rectify privately run physical education schools, avoiding the pitfalls of demanding perfection and nitpicking. (2) He expressed admiration and comfort for the school's efforts to recover and revive after the January 28th Incident and for Principal Lu's arduous struggle. (3) Addressing the graduates, he emphasized the importance of focusing on the basic physical fitness of students in primary and secondary schools, aiming to strengthen the nation, and not merely to solve personal employment issues. Principal Lu, Mrs. Zheng Wei, and Ms. Lin Kecong all gave pertinent and significant speeches, which will not be elaborated upon. The performances, such as the Danish Gymnastic Dance and the Joyful Preparation Dance, did not emphasize the splendor of costumes or the gracefulness of movements, but rather the rigid and healthy beauty of the dance postures, which was truly refreshing and commendable. Three plays were performed: "Love," "Zhi Lan and Zhong Qing," and "Returning South." The actors were well-suited for their roles, and the humorous and amusing moments were irresistible. By the time the meeting adjourned, the setting sun was already sinking in the west.</p>
<h3>Tai Chi Exercise Class for Primary School Principals</h3>
<p>The graduation ceremony for the first Tai Chi exercise class of the Shanghai Private Primary School Joint Association was held yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at Shuxing Primary School. The attendees included instructor Chu Minyi, Jiang Jianbai, representative of the Municipal Education Bureau, guests, and over two hundred graduating students. Weng Guoxun, Cui Jianwu, and Wu Qian served as the presidium. After performing the ceremony according to protocol, Chairman Weng Guoxun delivered a report, followed by a speech by instructor Chu Minyi. He briefly stated that Tai Chi exercise is most needed in modern China because (1) it does not cost money, (2) it does not require much effort, and (3) it does not take much time. He hoped that all the graduates would vigorously promote it, so that it would be widespread among the people nationwide, using Tai Chi exercise as the foundation for a strong country and a strong race. Finally, Feng Xiancheng, a graduate, gave a reply speech. Representative Jiang from the Municipal Education Bureau presented diplomas, and a group photo was taken before the meeting adjourned. At noon, all the executive members hosted a banquet for instructor Chu Minyi at Jue Lin.</p>
<h3>Central University in the Past Two Years (II) (Continued) Luo Jialun</h3>
<p>7. Centralizing Administrative Offices to Increase Efficiency: Previously, the offices of various departments and groups were scattered, making communication inconvenient and supervision difficult. Therefore, the two wings of the auditorium were repartitioned and properly arranged, and all the administrative offices of the school were moved in. Time was saved, and efficiency naturally increased.</p>
<p>8. Reforming the Accounting System: The supervision and evaluation of the school's finances depend on the accounting system. Due to accumulated habits, the school's accounting lacked established rules, leading to abuses. Even individuals could sell or purchase public property without restrictions. Therefore, three accountants were hired to establish a sound accounting system, which was promulgated and implemented in the autumn of the 21st year of the Republic. This was even before the government had formulated accounting regulations. The aim was to ensure that all accounts were itemized and readily available for inspection and reconciliation. Standard procedures for general affairs were established, standard prices were made public, and samples of goods were retained for verification.</p>
<p>9. Maintaining Regular Payroll and Striving for Stability in the Lives of Faculty and Staff: Fortunately, over the past two academic years, the government has provided support, and educational funding has not been in arrears. However, during times of crisis, such as the Rehe and Fujian incidents, the school also repeatedly faced financial difficulties. Nevertheless, efforts were made to maintain the established payroll schedule and avoid delays, in order to ensure the stability of the faculty and staff.</p>
<p>10. Consolidating Debts: The school's old debts were deeply accumulated, some dating back to the Southeast University era. During this period, efforts were made to consolidate them, and a committee was organized to review the documents. A total of over 60,000 yuan was repaid. For debts that could not be cleared, the repayment was postponed. However, during my tenure, a policy of preparing before purchasing was adopted, so there were no defaults. International credit has gradually been restored.</p>
<p>11. Establishing Scholarships: To encourage student scholarship and provide relief to impoverished students, scholarships were established each semester for approximately 70 students, totaling 140 students per academic year. There were two types of scholarships: college scholarships and department scholarships. College scholarships were 70 yuan per student per semester, and department scholarships were 50 yuan per student per semester. A committee organized by professors publicly evaluated and awarded scholarships to students with excellent academic performance.</p>
<p>12. Raising Admission Standards and Emphasizing University Education: University education should emphasize quality over quantity, as this is the only way to improve standards and develop scholarship. Therefore, the entrance examination for the 22nd academic year was conducted rigorously, with professors serving as members of the examination committee, eliminating all lobbying and favoritism. The ratio of accepted students to applicants was 1:12, ensuring a more uniform level of academic preparedness. As for the various examinations within the school, in addition to the graduation examination, which was conducted by a committee organized separately according to ministerial regulations, with scholars from both inside and outside the school participating, the other examinations were carefully conducted by the professors. The overall academic atmosphere has undergone a significant transformation.</p>
<p>13. Promoting Research and Encouraging Academic Publications: For professors who are interested in pursuing specialized research, efforts were made to provide equipment to the extent possible, and their research results were published to enhance the school's reputation in the international academic community. Over the past two academic years, four types of serial publications and approximately ten academic research reports have been launched. Although these are preliminary results, there will certainly be continued development and expansion in the future.</p>
<p>14. Striving to Cooperate with Art Institutions and Integrating with National and Social Undertakings: Over the past two academic years, the school has made every effort to assist in national and social undertakings, such as assisting the Huai River Conservancy Committee in analyzing the soil in the Huai River basin, assisting the General Staff Headquarters in surveying oil in Sichuan, planting hundreds of thousands of trees for afforestation in the capital's defense area, sending personnel to the Yunnan border to investigate biology, surveying the geology of the entire Jiangning Autonomous Experimental County, improving silkworm breeds, producing 20,000 silkworm egg sheets, and cooperating with the county in conducting agricultural improvement projects in the experimental township, and cooperating with the National Economic Council in running a planting training class, handling the investigation of secondary school English teaching materials for the China Cultural Education Foundation, etc. In addition, the establishment of the school's Education Experiment Institute, the Economic Information Room, and the Administrative Research Information Room were all preparations to train students to study current practical problems, so that national university education could be somewhat beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>These are just the major points; there are still many incomplete and inadequate aspects that require guidance and assistance from all parties. However, I cannot refrain from saying that whether the school can become a perfect national institution depends on whether the new campus can be built and relocated. Education is a century-long plan for the country, and we cannot be content with the current situation and rejoice in our own achievements. The reasons why the school must be relocated are as follows: (1) The current campus is in the center of the city and cannot be developed, such as the College of Engineering wanting to add factories and the College of Agriculture wanting to add experimental fields. (2) Being mixed in the city is not conducive to cultivating a noble and simple academic atmosphere. (3) The College of Agriculture and the main campus, especially the College of Science, are separated, making teaching equipment uneconomical. (4) The housing problems of professors and students cannot be satisfactorily resolved, which distracts the educators and prevents professors and students from being close to each other, so that the full effect of asking questions and questioning cannot be achieved. These are just the main points; there are many more details that can be described. The actual need is now urgent, so the relocation proposal is by no means a pursuit of extravagance. In two or three years, the academic community will have a clearer understanding. I sincerely hope that the wise government and people from all walks of life who care about the school will work hard to make it happen.</p>
<p>This is the good fortune of the school and the good fortune of scholarship. (June 16, 23rd year of the Republic)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Imperial Incense Drifting Record</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The dishes numbered more than a hundred, so the cooking and stir-frying work was of course extremely complicated! Now we will only talk about the situation in the carriages; among the four carriages that served as temporary imperial kitchens, only one was the real kitchen. In this carriage, along the walls on both sides, there were fifty stoves installed: these stoves were made of white clay-covered bricks, the frames were made of cast iron, and there was an iron plate underneath. These two pieces of ironware were also painted white, so not only was there no risk of fire, but they also looked very clean and tidy. Each stove was assigned to make two dishes per meal. The reader may ask: why not let each cook be responsible for more dishes, so as to reduce the number of stoves? There is also a reason for this, because many dishes cannot be made temporarily and require a lot of time to prepare. For example, stewed duck has to be simmered over low heat for two days to become tender.</p>
<p>When the Empress Dowager was about to have a meal, someone had to notify the drivers and brakemen, ordering them to stop the train; however, these dishes could not wait until the train stopped before being made. Fortunately, our train never traveled very fast from beginning to end, so the cooks could steadily serve the dishes while the train was moving.</p>
<p>Each stove was staffed by a cook on duty. These cooks were the so-called "masters." They had to have considerable qualifications to be able to work as "masters." But their work was very simple and effortless. Each person only had to make two dishes per meal, and nothing else. However, I always wondered whether the two dishes that each person was responsible for were indeed their own masterpieces? Even if they were, it is questionable whether their skills had reached their peak. (66)</p>
<h3>A Snapshot of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where people from all over gather. If you pay attention and observe carefully, there are really many surprising and strange things that have not been said by general writers! So I wrote it down below to give everyone something to laugh about.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday I went to Jing'an Temple Road</p>
<p>I saw a tall Western-style building. On the upper floor, under the glass windows and on the walls, there were scattered nail heads, and salted fish and preserved meat were hung in a tangled and interesting way. On the nearby drying platform, there were also several broken umbrellas and pairs of leather-nailed boots, piled up together outside an iron railing. A child's diaper and pointed toe socks, along with strips of foot cloth, were waving in the wind. Isn't this what you unexpectedly see in Shanghai in houses like that?</p>
<p>Another day, in the evening, I came out of an alley and suddenly encountered several very modern ladies, I don't know what they were chanting. Next to them were maids and servants, holding incense candles, ingots, and several bowls of dishes that looked like fresh fish and meat, placed at the entrance of the alley. After chanting a few "no's," they struck a match and burned the ingots, like purple butterflies flying up piece by piece. Isn't this another very funny thing? If someone has a disease and invites a female witch, then there must be this set of</p>
<p>tricks, called the "Sending Away Evil Spirits" ritual.</p>
<p>The incense in the Hong Temple is really prosperous. A friend said to me: this temple can be regarded as Shanghai's Mount Wutai. On the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, the income from incense offerings is unknown. What is even more incomprehensible is what are the devout men and women prostrating before the clay and wood carvings doing? And sometimes, even very fashionable well-known ladies are willing to go in and pray sincerely. Alas! As the ancients said, "Guanyin has no other blessings, but receives the heads of beauties." It is truly a good description! In fact, it can represent a shadow of the old society.</p>
<h3>An Eight-Year-Old Mental Arithmetic Master</h3>
<p>— Xue Chang</p>
<p>The son of Zhang Liangming in my hometown (Pingyao) is only eight years old. Because his family is poor, he has to help his parents with work, so he hasn't gone to school yet. But he has a natural talent, a talent that is unattainable by most children of the same age or a few years older who are already studying in school. What talent is it? It is mental arithmetic. When he was three years old, he already understood numbers. Now, he can mentally calculate various problems like "how much money per tael, how much money per catty, how much money per catty, how much money per tael." However, the largest answer cannot exceed ten thousand. People who know him are very fond of him because he has such a talent. They often stop him and ask him to calculate. If he doesn't calculate, they won't let him go. If he calculates, they give him copper coins or candy. People who ask him to calculate, because he calculates quickly and never makes mistakes, deliberately ask him to calculate more difficult numbers. But no matter how difficult the number is, he always answers immediately, so everyone is amazed. But Zhang'er is a poor child who is only eight years old and has not received any education, yet he has such a talent. So, how should children who are older than him and have studied for a few years feel about him? Northeast Fourth Company Commander Zhang Henshui</p>
<h3>Chapter Thirty: Watching the Mournful Geese Fly Away, Burying Heads to Defend the Homeland; A Bullet Pierces a Strong Arm, Splattering Blood to Stain a Lone City</h3>
<p>The gunfire outside the city was extremely fierce, and the artillery was constantly bombarding. Yin Deren murmured to himself in a low voice: This kid knows we're not easy to mess with, and he's retreating, so he's deliberately firing so fiercely. His voice grew quieter and quieter, and then he couldn't speak anymore. After an hour, the sky gradually brightened, and the enemy had retreated. There was no sound to be heard, only a smell of gunpowder in the air. Someone shouted: Second Brother, what's wrong with you? When Yin Deren slightly opened his eyes, Zhao Ziqiang was covered in dust, his face was also black, and he was standing beside him with a gun in his hand. He smiled and replied: It's nothing, I got a scratch. Ziqiang said: I went up to the city in the middle of the night too. I wasn't far from you, but I didn't have time to take care of you. Yin Deren said: Did the enemy retreat? Ziqiang said: They retreated before dawn. I estimate that they were only two or three hundred people. Yin Deren smiled slightly: They were probably just trying to scare us. As he was speaking, Baofang ran over with two brothers, leaned forward, shook Yin Deren's left hand, and said: Old Yin! You're okay. Yin Deren nodded a few times and smiled. The sky was even brighter, and only several patches of bloodstains could be seen where he was sitting. At the same time, his complexion had turned pale, probably due to a lot of blood loss. Baofang said: Company Commander Yin, you should go down and rest. Let the brothers help you. Yin Deren suddenly stood up and laughed: A little scratch on the arm, it's nothing! Let's go! As he said the words, he swayed a few times. Baofang said: You should still let someone help you. Yin Deren supported his right arm with his left hand and shook his head, saying: That would be a joke. Absolutely not, absolutely not. He just swayed like that, all the way down the fortress. Zhao Ziqiang stood beside the bloodstains, unable to help but be stunned, thinking to himself, people always say that Second Brother Yin is shrewd and not easy to tease, but when it comes to big events, this strength is really unambiguous. I, Zhao Ziqiang, am not a fool, shouldn't I learn from him? Yin Deren's attitude really excited him a lot. He opened his eyes and looked at the fortress, if there were enemies, he would be very willing to continue firing two shots. (417)</p>
<h3>A Stroll in Miaohang</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>Miaohang, also known as Mixiang Town, is the place where the fierce battle between China and Japan took place during the January 28th Incident. Yesterday, during my day off, I drove there, passing through North Baoxing Road, Yuexiu Road, Jiangchang Road, Lingnan Road, and Miaohang Road, about twenty miles to reach it. Miaohang Road is thirty feet wide, and the sidewalk is lined with trees, their green leaves full of branches, making the scenery particularly beautiful. The road surface is dry and high, making the drive very comfortable. The old villages there were destroyed by artillery fire, and the remnants can still be vaguely seen. The local people's temple, the Big Temple, still stands tall and unharmed. In front of the temple are three large rows of houses on the east and west sides, which were built by the relief association for the disaster victims after the war. The square in front of the houses is exceptionally wide and flat, and the peasant women and children weave and play in it, content and at ease, with a flavor of a model village. Across the river north of the temple, the authorities have cleared fifty or sixty acres of land to build a "Tomb of Unknown Heroes" to commemorate the loyal and brave soldiers of our army who died in the Sino-Japanese War. It is said that construction will begin soon. When it is completed, I think there will be a large influx of people coming from Shanghai to participate. It is a pity that the road only reaches Miaohang, and one has to make a detour on the old road when returning. If the authorities could open a new road from Sanmin Road or from Shanghai's First Public Cemetery to connect with Miaohang Road, then tourists could visit the magnificent central district of the city in addition to paying tribute to the loyal souls. I think this is something the authorities would be happy to do, or perhaps it is already in the plans?</p>
<p>Near the temple, the leprosarium occupies about eighty acres of land, with a wooden sign erected saying "Leprosarium Base," indicating that this will be the site of the hospital in the future. Leprosy is extremely contagious and causes great harm. Once a hospital is established, the surrounding area will be uninhabitable, and even passing by on the road will be dangerous. Other countries mostly build them on remote islands. Now that the hospital wants to be built in this location, it will inevitably spoil the scenery greatly. I suppose the authorities and the local farmers have not considered this, otherwise they would surely prefer to relocate the site. I record this with my pen upon returning. (Que Chou)</p>
<h3>A Friendship Across Generations</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>In the late Eastern Han Dynasty, Kong Rong was fifty years old, and Mi Heng was just twenty, their relationship was like father and son, but they were friends, and people called it a friendship across generations.</p>
<p>Coming down to today, if a person has no love for others, and the age of the person they love is a little older, or like a son or grandson, they still cannot be said to have exhausted all romantic affairs!</p>
<p>Some say, this is probably the friendship across generations of modern times! It is a pity that the "way" of being "friends" is very different from Kong and Mi</p>
<h3>A Love Affair of Japanese Admiral Togo Heihachiro</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>In this month, Japan's political situation has been very tense, and suddenly there was the news of the death of Admiral Togo Heihachiro. Newspapers all over Japan were competing to publish about the deeds of Admiral Togo. Now I will translate and introduce to readers a love affair of Togo during his study in England. It has always been said that heroes are fond of beauty, which everyone admits. In the eyes of the Japanese, Togo is of course a unique great hero, and being fond of beauty is undoubtedly the case. In February of the fourth year of the Meiji era, he was selected by the Ministry of the Navy and sent to England to study, majoring in naval warfare. He returned to Japan in May of the eleventh year of the Meiji era, after more than seven years of study. During these seven years of studying abroad, assiduous study certainly accounted for seven or eight out of ten, but life in the arms of women also accounted for one or two parts. In the first and second years, he specialized in finding interest in books. However, studying this kind of murderous knowledge is always drier and more boring than studying other knowledge, so he had no choice but to walk around in London cafes. The first time he walked into Louis Cafe, his loyal and simple heart was intoxicated by the London girl who was bare-armed and bare-chested. In addition, the London girl's crisp English and moving smile came to inquire about Mr. Togo's name, and at this time, the tension in his heart was even more severe than when the Russian Baltic Fleet arrived near Uku Island. Because he grew up in a family with a strong feudal consciousness, he had never even talked to young women with smiles. So on this night, he tossed and turned in bed and couldn't sleep, and the other ten Japanese students thought it was strange. The next day, everyone asked him the reason why he couldn't sleep, and he always blushed and couldn't answer.</p>
<p>It was not easy to wait until the second Sunday, when he changed into a very clean Western-style suit, polished his leather shoes until they were shiny black, and shaved all his whiskers, looking at his face in the mirror again and again, always feeling somewhat unsatisfied, and went to Louis Cafe. As for the London girl, she changed into a more gorgeous dress, showing an even more charming smile, and was already waiting at the door, and said, "Sir, I really miss you so much that I'm getting sick." This sentence is the common language of cafe women. How would he know that Mr. Togo thought that she and he were already suffering from the same symptoms? Therefore, Mr. Togo said a lot of honest words, and the London girl's cafe policy was successful for the most part, and the name of Miss Florentine (Florentine was the name of the London girl who was a cafe waitress) also swirled in Mr. Togo's mind forever.</p>
<p>From then on, every Sunday, his footprints were either in Louis Cafe, or he and Miss Florentine walked in the park, shadow to shadow. He was a very honest person and gradually understood some worldliness; shaking hands, kissing, dancing, etc. were not behind others. He loved Miss Florentine very much and wanted to marry her, but thinking about the environment in his home country, it would absolutely not allow the realization of his wish, and the tears of a hero also flowed slowly. At that time, Florentine took a three-week long vacation from Louis Cafe because her mother was seriously ill and returned to her hometown, and he fell in love with another waitress. After Florentine returned to Louis, he and Florentine and Philly (Philly was the name of another waitress) went to the park together, holding Florentine's hand tightly with his left hand and Philly's hand tightly with his right hand. He thought Florentine didn't know that he was holding Philly's hand tightly, and at the same time thought Philly didn't know that he was holding Florentine's hand tightly, so that Florentine and Philly wouldn't suspect that he preferred the other person. However, this plan of his was exposed by Philly in person. Philly's words were to Togo, "Your love for me can be seen in the tightness of the handshake." This caused Mr. Togo the greatest shame. Knowing shame is akin to courage, and from then on, his love affair in London came to an end.</p>

<h3>Physician Yin Leren of Nantong Accused of Negligence: A Statement</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Dr. Yin Leren, the director of Leren Hospital in Nantong, provided late-night treatment to a poor woman. The woman was suffering from meningitis, and Dr. Yin injected her with 20 cubic centimeters of anti-meningitis serum. When about half of the injection was administered, the woman suddenly moved violently, and those assisting her were alarmed and lost control, causing the needle to break, leaving over an inch of it lodged between her fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. Dr. Yin immediately instructed her to come to the hospital that night for treatment. Unexpectedly, she delayed seeking medical attention and died due to the worsening of her meningitis. According to Dr. Yin's report, two months ago, someone came and said that the woman's family intended to sue Dr. Yin in court and demanded 300 yuan as a settlement. Dr. Yin did not agree at that time. Recently, they accused Dr. Yin in the Nantong court of being a quack doctor who committed murder intentionally. Although I am not personally acquainted with Dr. Yin, I have always heard of his charitable deeds and that he possesses extensive knowledge and experience, making him incomparable to the so-called quack doctors of the world. His provision of late-night treatment alone proves that he possesses a passionate desire to save people. Yet, he receives the name of a murderer for his intention to save lives, and is even accused of acting intentionally. I ask, why would a doctor intentionally kill someone while treating them? This point alone is enough to discourage those who do good! If we further examine the treatment process and the cause of the woman's death, Dr. Yin bears no professional negligence whatsoever. The needle broke because the patient suddenly moved violently, combined with the force of her family's assistance, which was not Dr. Yin's fault. This is the first point. Moreover, the broken needle could only be lodged within the bone joint and would not circulate with the blood to cause death. This is the second point. After the needle broke, Dr. Yin instructed her to come to the hospital that night for treatment, with the intention of removing the broken needle and continuing the treatment for meningitis, as only half of the 20 cubic centimeters of serum had been injected. Without continued treatment, there would be little hope. However, the woman's family delayed seeking medical attention, so the woman's death was due to the family's own negligence. Dr. Yin can be said to have done everything humanly possible! This is the third point.</p>
<p>After the woman's death, her family made no expression of complaint towards Dr. Yin, indicating that their conscience had not been completely extinguished. However, the sudden accusation months later suggests a clear background. Since Dr. Yin established his hospital in Nantong, his dedicated treatment has earned him the trust of the people of Nantong, resulting in high reputation for a time, leading malicious individuals to seek to extort money on various pretexts. Now that they have found an opportunity, they spare no effort to use an ignorant villager to fulfill their desires. Hence, the earlier demand by someone for 300 yuan as a settlement fee. When their desire was not met, they were driven to extremes and had no choice but to meet in court! The treacherousness of such people's intentions is self-evident and not worth discussing. It is regrettable that our doctors receive negative consequences for their good intentions! In recent years, medical disputes have repeatedly occurred in the country, and in reality, almost all of them have some background. These are attempts to sow discord between doctors and patients to facilitate extortion. This is a genuine obstacle to the medical profession. Dr. Yin's case is just one example! We sincerely hope that Dr. Yin will stand firm based on academic principles and facts, fighting to the end. We will also exert our full strength to assist him, so that justice can be upheld and the medical profession can be protected. Otherwise, we will be at the mercy of others, unable to secure our independent survival!</p>
<h3>On the Beijing Municipal Poisoning Case</h3>
<p>— Lian Ruiqi</p>
<p>Whenever a poisoning incident occurs, the first step is to have the poisoned individual examined by a doctor to diagnose the symptoms, followed by a study of the symptoms. Then, invite a forensic chemistry expert to analyze the vomitus, diarrhea, urine, blood, etc. If the person has died, a forensic examination must be conducted, dissecting the body and taking out the internal organs. The autopsy report, along with the removed internal organs and their contents, should be sealed and sent to a forensic chemistry expert specializing in pharmacology for analysis. This is the first step in dealing with such unfortunate incidents. Secondly, the poisoned person's environment, daily necessities, such as daily drinks, food, household air, personal clothing, and other suspicious items, should be thoroughly inspected. These are all proper procedures that should be followed.</p>
<p>I have not yet seen the full analysis report of the Beijing Municipal poisoning case, making it difficult to provide a definitive critique. I can only offer some opinions based on the fragments reported in the news recently. According to a report on May 10th, over forty people were poisoned after eating "Tongfenhua" and chrysanthemum vegetables, with symptoms including headache, dizziness, purple lips, rapid heartbeat, pale complexion, dilated pupils, and occasional nausea and vomiting. The remaining vegetables and vomited food have been sent to the Central Hygiene Laboratory for urgent analysis. Here, I want to ask whether the remaining "Tongfenhua" chrysanthemum vegetables and vomited food contain poisonous substances. If so, what kind of poison is it? Does it match the poisoning symptoms? The hygiene authorities should clearly announce the analysis results. Another report on May 11th stated that seventeen more people were found to be poisoned in the afternoon. An investigation revealed that salt poisoning was suspected. The sales of salt from Dexinglong and Taimaoheng were suspended. The police also notified the suspension of sales of salt sold in small shops in the Hanximen and Xiaguan areas, as it was suspected of containing toxic substances. Another report on May 12th stated that poisoning continued in Hanximen. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau notified the police bureau that before the case is clarified, the sale of salt, vegetables, and other similar items in that area should be suspended. Therefore, under the ambiguous language of "suspected salt poisoning," "suspected of containing toxic substances," and "before the case is clarified," the abrupt suspension of business operations for merchants is somewhat excessive.</p>
<p>In short, hesitation in the face of events, panic, and loss of composure are all due to the imperfect nature of all hygiene regulations. If all food, beverages, recreational items, and everyday utensils had established standards and were regulated by law, and if investigations were conducted regularly, with any sales of substandard items being prohibited, then food containing toxic substances would not be found in the market, and poisoning incidents caused by food and drink would be rare. If merchants do not comply with the law, once verified, the police and health bureaus should impose penalties according to the regulations, and merchants would have no grounds for complaint. For example, the standards for salt in Germany, Japan, and Switzerland stipulate that good salt is a dry, white crystal. However, if the magnesium chloride content reaches 0.2%, it becomes hygroscopic and has a bitter, salty taste. The Swiss food testing book (Schweizerisches Lebensmittelpuch) stipulates that pure salt should be a dry, white crystal, odorless, with a pure salty taste. Water-insoluble substances and potassium salts should only be present in trace amounts. The amount of sodium sulfate and calcium sulfate should be less than 1%, and heavy metals should be completely absent.</p>
<p>We know that the composition of salt is due to chlorine (Zacl), but there are many mixed impurities. The Ministry of Health's analysis stated that the salt contained a large amount of nitrous acid poison, also referred to as nitrites and sodium nitrite. This seems to be inconsistent. Nitrous acid is different from nitrites, and sodium nitrite is a type of nitrite. What exactly is the substance contained in the composition, nitrous acid or sodium nitrite? And what does "a large amount" mean? What is the percentage content? All of this needs to be clearly announced. As for the experiment of injecting 0.6 of toxic salt into three rabbits weighing over one kilogram, resulting in death within twenty minutes, it is indeed prudent. However, the saline solution injected into human blood vessels is a pure, refined physiological saline solution. If 0.6 of toxic salt is injected into a small animal, death is inevitable. Even injecting ordinary, unrefined salt into an animal's body could be dangerous. This requires further consideration in the experiment. Furthermore, the physiological effects of food consumed orally are completely different from those injected into blood vessels. This requires further consideration in the experiment. Also, with regards to the 0.6 injected into the animal's blood vessels, what amount of water was used to dissolve the salt compound? In other words, what was the concentration? Concentration is greatly related to physiological effects. This requires even further consideration in the experiment. According to Kopest's report, someone took half a gram of sodium nitrite multiple times in one day and did not experience poisoning. The medicinal dose of sodium nitrite is 0.3 grams per dose, and 1 gram per day. Now, assuming that the salt is indeed mixed with sodium nitrite, the amount of salt used in cooking is never large, and the amount of salt in each person's food is even smaller. Even if the salt is mixed with sodium nitrite, it is doubtful whether it exceeds the toxic dose. This is the fourth aspect that should be considered in the experiment. The symptoms of sodium nitrite poisoning include frequent urination, diarrhea, nausea, a feeling of suffocation, and a pale complexion. This does not fully match the symptoms of this poisoning incident reported in the news. This is the fifth aspect that requires careful consideration in the experiment. As for the Salt Administration's statement, "Whether this disease is caused by salt is a question that can be understood by comparing the symptoms mentioned above. Whether or not sodium nitrite is found can be determined by jointly analyzing the same salt with the Ministry of Health, or by inviting a third party to analyze it." The statement, "The compound of salt itself is definitely not toxic. Salt poisoning must be due to mixtures. This administration's previous announcement of the truth, stating that there is no poison in salt, refers to the compound. Readers who do not investigate misunderstand that this administration fundamentally denies that there is poison in salt," is too general in its wording, indicating that they themselves have not clarified whether there is any poison in the salt. If the Salt Administration stipulates salt standards, and hygienic analysis experts determine the percentage of sodium chloride and the percentage of mixtures, and if it does not exceed the standard amount, then it cannot be identified as toxic, and the police bureau and other agencies must not arbitrarily stop salt merchants from doing business, causing merchants to suffer business losses. In short, if the salt is mixed with a trace amount of sodium nitrate, then it may be just impurities. If it is a large amount, then there is another situation. Otherwise, it is not difficult to determine from salt or other substances. Considering the news reports, the procedures in all aspects have been inconsistent. The poisoning of over eighty people in the capital within a few days is an unprecedented tragedy, and it is also a representation of the poor hygiene administration in our country. Learning from past mistakes can inspire future progress. It is not difficult to quickly catch up and seek measures that are in line with hygiene administration. Here is a brief outline:</p>
<p>1. The Ministry of Interior should quickly hire hygiene chemistry experts to formulate regulations for controlling various foods, beverages, recreational items, and daily necessities.</p>
<p>2. The analysis of poisons must be conducted by forensic chemists specializing in pharmacology based on the analysis of toxic chemicals. 3. Technical experts from the Salt Administration should hire hygienic chemistry experts to serve as officials. After the salt in various places has undergone standardized analysis, its components and content should be checked at any time.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Q&amp;A About Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(33) Acute Intestinal Mucositis (Part 1)</p>
<p>(Q) What is acute intestinal mucositis?</p>
<p>(A) It is a disease of fever and diarrhea caused by various infections and stimuli in the intestine. Many people used to translate it as acute intestinal catarrh.</p>
<p>(Q) At what age is this disease most likely to occur?</p>
<p>(A) It can occur almost anytime in nursing infants and young children.</p>
<p>(Q) How many causes are there for acute intestinal mucositis?</p>
<p>(A) There are many causes. We can roughly divide them into the following seven categories: (1) Due to infectious microscopic organisms (like diarrhea from summer cholera), auto-intoxication (like uremia, diarrhea after burns, canned food poisoning, etc.) or a part of the symptoms of several intestinal infectious diseases.</p>
<p>(2) Unhealthy diet (like overeating and drinking, indigestible foods, ice-cold drinks, rotten foods, unripe fruits, etc.).</p>
<p>(3) Cold.</p>
<p>(4) Mucosa-irritating drugs (like suicide attempts with strong acids or alkalis, arsenic, and large doses of laxatives, etc.).</p>
<p>(5) Mechanical irritation (like hard stools, swallowed fruit pits, copper coins, intestinal parasites, frequent enemas, etc.).</p>
<p>(6) Circulatory disorders (like heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, etc.)</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>Occasionally caused by abdominal injuries.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of this disease?</p>
<p>(A) The main symptoms of acute intestinal mucositis are diarrhea</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>, abdominal pain, fever, and thick urine.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the characteristics of the diarrhea?</p>
<p>(A) Bowel movements occur two or three times to more than ten times a day. The consistency varies, sometimes like thin porridge, sometimes even like water. It is usually yellow or green due to mixing with bile. Stools often contain mucus and have a strong foul odor.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the characteristics of the abdominal pain?</p>
<p>(A) The abdominal pain can be persistent or spasmodic, like colic. If there is inflammation of the rectal mucosa, it is accompanied by tenesmus (a feeling of needing to defecate) and straining.</p>
<p>(Q) Besides abdominal pain, what other symptoms are there?</p>
<p>(A) There is also thirst and decreased appetite. It can also affect the stomach, causing nausea and vomiting. The tongue is coated with a thick fur. Sometimes there is abdominal distension and tenderness, and fever blisters appear on the lips.</p>
<p>(Q) How are the patient's body temperature and overall condition?</p>
<p>(A) The body temperature rises to 38 to 39 degrees Celsius, the pulse is rapid and weak, the limbs are cold, and the face is haggard. In severe cases, there are symptoms of gastrocnemius muscle spasms and collapse.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the patient's urine like?</p>
<p>(A) The urine is thick, the indican reaction is positive, and in severe cases, protein and casts can be detected in the urine.</p>
<p>(Q) Are the general symptoms of patients with acute intestinal mucositis uniform?</p>
<p>(A) No, they are not uniform. They vary depending on which part of the intestinal tract is inflamed.</p>
<p>(Q) What happens if the inflamed part is in the small intestine?</p>
<p>(A) In this case, although the inflammation is in the small intestine, it rarely remains confined to this part. Therefore, diagnosis is not easy. The feces are porridge-like, and there is little diarrhea, mixed with very small amounts of mucus or yellow mucus particles.</p>
<h3>Continued Common Sense About Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Ren</p>
<p>(4) Talking about an eye disease caused by gonorrhea</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is also known as "white turbid discharge." Now, it can be considered a modern disease. We only need to look at the sales of Shantemi entertainment drugs and the doctors who advertise everywhere to treat venereal diseases to know that there are many cases of this disease. Therefore, the eye disease caused by gonorrhea that I want to talk about is also becoming more and more common. This eye disease is called gonococcal conjunctivitis in medicine. The Japanese call it "wind eye" because it develops very quickly and causes blindness just as fast, as if it were the wind. Also, because the pus from the eye drips like a leaking pot when it occurs, it is also called purulent conjunctivitis in medicine. When it occurs in adults, it is called adult purulent eye. When it occurs in newborn infants, it is called newborn purulent eye. I will first talk about the development of adult purulent eye.</p>
<p>The origin of this eye disease is mostly from the pus of one's own urethral gonorrhea or from the pus of another gonorrhea patient, which is directly or indirectly transmitted to the eye. After half a day to three days, symptoms similar to those of acute conjunctivitis (commonly known as red eye) suddenly occur, that is, the palpebral conjunctiva (commonly known as the inside of the eyelid) becomes red, swollen, and teary. At this time, the patient often thinks it is an ordinary eye disease and does not pay attention to it. When the bulbar conjunctiva (commonly known as the white of the eye) becomes red and swollen, or even edematous, the eyelid (eyelid) droops due to excessive swelling, and slight pressure causes pain. A yellow liquid flows out of the eye, and the patient feels a burning sensation in the eye, or as if something is stuck in the eye. At this time, even without pressing the eyelid, the pain is unbearable. Only then does the patient become frightened. After two or three days, the degree of redness and swelling decreases, and the pain also alleviates a little. However, the yellow liquid flowing out of the eye increases instead and becomes pure, thick pus, like milk, constantly overflowing from the eye, like a never-ending spring. The patient is tormented by wiping the eye. The name "purulent eye" comes from this pus-flowing phenomenon. The most dangerous time is when an ulcer occurs on the cornea (commonly known as the black of the eye), because the ulcer is prone to perforation. Once it perforates, the contents of the eye, such as the lens, vitreous body, and iris, will prolapse, turning into a staphyloma (commonly known as crab eyes) and causing blindness. What a tragic, pitiful, and regrettable thing this is.</p>
<h3>A Brief Introduction to Pulmonary Tuberculosis (10)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 5 Pathological Anatomy</p>
<p>The part about pathological anatomy is relatively dry and uninteresting and difficult to understand completely. It is so for medical professionals, let alone ordinary readers. But difficult to understand as it is, its importance is undeniable. First, if we want to thoroughly understand the essence of every disease, we must rely on reports from pathological anatomy. Without having to go too far, the initial infection process and the statistics of pulmonary tuberculosis patients mentioned above are completely proved by corpse dissection. Second, the classification of each disease, especially pulmonary tuberculosis, although its clinical symptoms have some basis, ultimately relies on reports from pathological anatomy. If we do not discuss this and only focus on the external circumstances, it is like scratching an itch through shoes. The paths taken by scientific medicine and old medicine are fundamentally different. Although it may be difficult for readers to understand in this popular text, I feel that a dedicated chapter is indispensable.</p>
<p>What kind of pathological anatomical changes does tuberculosis present in the human body? The answer to this question is, of course, complex, but ultimately, in one sentence, it is the inflammation in pathology. Its phenomenon is nothing more than disorders of the vascular system and local tissues. Initially, it presents as a local congestion state, so-called inflammatory hyperemia. Then comes tissue infiltration, and finally, connective tissue hyperplasia leads to tissue degeneration. These four stages are generally how common inflammations proceed. Although its lesion is local, its migration is indeed very complex. According to the nature of its lesions, there are differences between exudative, degenerative, and proliferative inflammation. The inflammatory process in tuberculosis completely encompasses the exudative and proliferative aspects.</p>
<h3>Ginseng (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Yuhuang</p>
<p>Another type of Korean ginseng, Byeoljik ginseng, is what the Japanese call red ginseng. It is imported from Korea and Japan and is made by steaming water ginseng and then drying it in the sun or baking it. The products sold in stores are about 13-15 cm long, about 1.52 cm in diameter, and the branch roots are about 0.5 cm long. The fibrous roots have all been removed. The best quality product is shaped like a chicken leg or a human figure, heavy in texture, and amber in color. The interior is moist and red. Usually, the upper part of the root is reddish-brown and opaque, and the lower part is reddish-yellow and slightly transparent. It tastes sweet and slightly bitter. Because this root is steamed, the starch in the cells is gelatinized, so it becomes a keratinous state. This root is currently a monopoly product of the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>(A) Macroscopic observation of a smooth cross-section of ginseng with a macroscopic lens reveals a white outer cortex and a light yellow inner cortex. The white formation ring line is separated from the yellowish-brown secondary stele (metaxylem). The tips of the sieve tubes are more intensely colored and have a bent, curved appearance, accompanied by body lines. There are often small fissures and yellowish-brown spots, which are its resin ducts. Inside the secondary stele, the color gradually fades, becoming almost yellowish-white, reaching the center and becoming pure white. This is the primary stele (protoxylem), which often has small spots of vessel elements (primary protoxylem) scattered throughout. The stele has radial lines radiating outward, reaching the secondary stele, where scattered white spots, the vessel elements (secondary metaxylem) are visible.</p>
<p>(B) Microscopic observation with a microscope reveals that some of the phellem has peeled off, often leaving only its remnants. The complete remnants have three to four layers of thin-walled cork cells. Continuous with it is the outer cortex (primary), with loose tissue, very thin cell walls, and tangential elongation. The cells contain very little starch and often have large resin ducts and mucilage cells, containing yellow secretions embedded within them. Further in is the inner cortex (secondary), although the boundary is not clear, the tissue is denser, the cells contain starch, and there are gaps in the direction of the medullary rays. The sieve elements are composed of small cells, and resin ducts are also found inside, but they are very narrow. The resin ducts of the stone cells have a wider diameter, starting from the sieve element and ending at the outer cortex, occupying the tangential direction and arranged in three rings. The wood lacks a pith, the protoxylem is present in the center, and the metaxylem connects to the radius lines, arranged radially. The medullary rays are located between the vessel elements, running parallel to the vascular bundles in one to three or four rows. Calcium oxalate forms cluster crystals or single crystals (mostly cluster crystals). They are present in both the cortex and the wood. In the longitudinal section, the vessel elements near the cambium are spiral-shaped and segmented, connected in groups of two or three. Most of the sieve tube ends are degenerated. Most of the starch is gelatinized, hindering the clarity of other tissues. Spiral short tubes, aggregated at the time of origin, and cell division tissue layers are found at the root end of this product. Preparation methods for white ginseng and red ginseng (1) White ginseng. When ginseng is dug out of the ground, its outer color is grey-black. Take a bamboo bow, expand it with string, and saw off most of the black skin (cork). The inner cortex is still rich in milky white juice. It tastes very bitter, so it must be prepared before it can be used. The method is: select the whole ginseng, do not remove its beard (if you remove the ginseng beard when it is fresh, the milky white Ze will seep out), and put it into a pot of boiling water. Boil it for about four or five minutes until it is half-yellow, and then quickly take it out (if it is boiled excessively, the original flavor will be weak and turn red). Then put it into a wooden box that is four inches high, two feet long, and one and a half feet wide. The box has a glass lid and holes in the bottom to allow ventilation. Then spread a bamboo curtain on it. Place the ginseng on the curtain and expose it to the sun until it is dry. After being dried in the sun, it becomes light yellow. It can be stored in a sealed quicklime jar, which will naturally keep it permanently without deterioration. The so-called sugar white ginseng is a by-product obtained during the preparation of this ginseng.</p>
<p>(2) Red ginseng. Domestic red ginseng, such as Shizhu ginseng, generally adopts the Korean method. The general method of making Korean red ginseng is to wash the roots and stems dug in the autumn and remove the attached soil and sand. After drying in the sun for one or two days, steam it. The pot used is usually one foot six inches in diameter and two feet three inches in depth.</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Production Restriction Problem</h3>
<p>— Jiang Dixian</p>
<p>Recently, a matter that has aroused serious attention in the world's cotton industry is the Peng Haide proposal to restrict cotton production in the United States, which has been passed by both houses of the U.S. Congress and approved by President Roosevelt and has been announced to be implemented.</p>
<p>American cotton production accounts for half of the world's total, and it has a significant impact on the supply and demand relationship of cotton. The rise and fall of cotton prices in various countries are governed by American cotton. Even the market conditions of yarn and cloth are closely related to American cotton. Therefore, the implementation of the U.S. cotton reduction plan is sufficient to arouse serious attention from the world's cotton industry.</p>
<p>Since 1929, the world economy has declined, and cotton trade has been particularly poor, with cotton consumption also decreasing accordingly. However, American cotton production, not only did not decrease with consumption, but also had a bumper harvest in 1931, resulting in more than 13 million bales of American cotton in the world at the end of July 1932. Cotton prices also showed an inverse ratio, falling to five cents. The American government and the public unanimously put forward the slogan of reducing planting. The cotton fields in 1932 were indeed reduced compared to the previous year, but the production was still equal to consumption, and the large amount of stock was still not reduced. Therefore, the propaganda for reducing production after the cotton harvest that year became even more intense. Unexpectedly, the cotton fields planted in 1933 were more than in 1932. President Roosevelt, who had just taken office and claimed to be engaged in recovery, was greatly alarmed and implemented a policy of eliminating cotton fields. The cotton fields were reduced from 40 million mu planted to less than 30 million mu left. Although the field elimination policy was successful, the cotton harvest was again abundant. The cotton fields were 5 million mu less than the previous year, but the cotton production still reached 13 million bales. The U.S. authorities, in view of this situation, believed that without a further production restriction plan, there was no way to stabilize cotton prices, and therefore there was the Peng Haide production reduction plan (BanklieapBiiiHester).</p>
<p>The Peng production reduction plan was discovered at the beginning of the year and, after a long period of delay and multiple revisions, was approved and implemented by the President on April 21. During this period, not only was the U.S. cotton market completely dominated by the progress of this plan, but in fact, the cotton markets of various countries were almost all shifted by the Peng plan. In the cotton market reports of the United States, Britain, India, and other countries, there are often sentences such as "waiting for the development of the Peng plan," "falling due to disappointment with the Peng plan," and "firm due to the development of the Peng plan," which can prove this.</p>
<p>The Peng plan was revised several times in the U.S. Congress. Initially (March 2), the main points of the proposal from the House Agriculture Committee to the House of Representatives were: (1) The cotton production for 1934-35 was limited to 9 million bales; (2) A special tax of 12 cents per pound was levied on the excess amount. On the 27th, the Senate made amendments: (1) The total production should not exceed 10 million bales; (2) The first six bales produced by each cotton farmer would be exempt from tax; (3) Cotton with a length of more than one and a half inches would be exempt from tax; (4) Those exceeding the prescribed limit would pay a tax of 75% of the market price. On April 13, a joint meeting of the House and Senate made further revisions: (1) A tax of 50% would be levied on excess cotton when it was sold; (2) The exemption of six bales of tax-free cotton for each cotton farmer was deleted; (3) The effective time of this plan was one year, but the President could extend it for one year if the cotton farmers requested an extension. It was fully passed on the 17th and sent to the White House, and Roosevelt signed and approved it on the 21st. The process and method of the Peng plan are roughly like this.</p>
<p>Restricting cotton production to maintain cotton prices seems to be a policy unanimously supported by the United States. However, in reality, there are also many opponents. For example, when the Senate discussed this plan, Republican senators strongly opposed it, saying that forced restrictions would lead to a revolution in the South! Therefore, the second and third articles of the amendment are intended to reduce the power of this plan. However, the final passage was still the original article. If the Senate amendment is followed, the effect will be very small, and there is a risk that the current cotton price will not be easy to maintain.</p>
<p>Some people believe that although this plan has been approved, the result remains to be seen in fact. This kind of doubt is certainly very appropriate. However, in terms of the current political situation in the United States, it can probably achieve considerable results, as evidenced by the result of the field elimination last year. Therefore, the focus of the current research on this matter is not on whether the implementation can succeed, but on what the benefits and harms will be after success.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the United States to implement restrictions on cotton production is that there is too much cotton in stock and cotton prices are too low. Without restricting production reduction, it is not enough to reduce the amount of cotton in stock. Without reducing the amount of cotton in stock, it is not enough to maintain cotton prices. Now, we will briefly observe the production, consumption, and stock quantities of American cotton in recent seasons (unit: 500-pound bale).</p>

<p>1934│35 :::::: 10,000,000 (Note) The stock in the table is based on Hester's report, the production is based on the final revised estimate of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the consumption is based on the report of the International Cotton Textile Federation, the consumption in 1933│34 is for the first half of the season, and the production in 1934│35 is based on the U.S. government's quota.</p>
<p>The low price of 5 cents for American cotton spot in June 1932 was the result of the above table "End-of-Season Stock in 1932│33" reaching 13,449,000 bales. The United States has very detailed statistics on the cotton industry, and it can use statistics to estimate the future surplus and deficiency of supply and demand at any time. Because all statistical figures are extremely accurate, moreover, it changes with the trend of the estimated results. After the publication of the bumper cotton production estimate in 1931, the end-of-season stock was estimated from consumption to increase greatly, and cotton prices gradually fell to 5 cents. The fall of American cotton to 5 cents was due to the increase in production and the decrease in consumption. The sharp decline in consumption in the above table from 1928 is also an important reason for promoting the large increase in stock. When American cotton fell to 5 cents, it was lower than the prices of other cotton in the world. At the same time, American cotton was abundant in 1931, while India and our country reported poor harvests. Under these two special circumstances, American cotton consumption has been increasing again since 1931. In the past two years, although production has not decreased, due to the progress in consumption, the stock has gradually decreased. In the first half of this season (from August 1933 to the end of January 1934), the world consumed 7,018,000 bales of American cotton. Judging from the current state of American cotton consumption, the second half of the season is roughly equal to the first half of the season. It is assumed that the total consumption for this season is 14 million bales and included in the above table. It is estimated that the stock at the end of this season (the end of July 1934) is about 10.7 million bales, a decrease of 1 million bales compared to the end of the previous season. The biggest reason why the current cotton price can rise by 2-3 points compared to the same period last season is this. Now that the U.S. government is implementing a restriction on this season's cotton production to 10 million bales, then based on the above-mentioned estimated stock at the end of this season, the total supply of American cotton in the next season (that is, 1934│35) is 20.7 million bales, a decrease of more than 4 million bales compared to this season. If the consumption in the next season is the same as in this season, about 14 million bales, then the stock at the end of the next season will drop to 6.7 million bales, which is close to the end of the 1929│30 season in the above table. It is found that the highest price of American cotton during this season was 19.55, the lowest price was 12.45, and the average price was 16.60. If the above-mentioned reasoning is consistent with the actual situation, gradually realized from the present with the advancement of time, excluding other relationships, then the current cotton price is still at the lowest level. In the future, it will gradually rise with the gradual realization of the reasoning and reach the highest price of 19.55. However, there are many reasons that can affect cotton prices, and there is no certainty whether the above-mentioned estimation can be consistent with the facts. For example, if the price of American cotton actually rises, it will be enough to affect its consumption and make the above-mentioned reasoning shake.</p>
<p>Since 1928│29, the decrease in American cotton consumption has been due to the decline of the world economy, the sluggish cotton trade, and the decrease in total cotton sales. American cotton accounts for the largest share, and the decrease rate is relatively large. The increase rate of American cotton is particularly large compared to other cotton flowers in recent years. Indian cotton, which is second to American cotton, has also decreased. Of course, there is a relationship between the amount of supply, and the price is also an influence. Let us compare the world's cotton sales and cotton prices in the past few years every half year as follows.</p>
<p>American Cotton Indian Cotton Other Cotton Shanghai Standard Cotton</p>

<p>First half of 1935 7,323,000 10.45 5.90 2,161,000 219.00 168.50 2,986,000 33.75 29.34</p>
<p>Second half of 1935 7,018,000 11.75 8.65 2,353,000 215.50 175.50 3,148,000 35.27.46 (Note) Consumption is in 500-pound bales, the price of American cotton is in cents, the price of Indian cotton is in rupees, and the price of Shanghai standard cotton is in taels. Since the second half of 1932, 1.75 taels must be subtracted for comparison because the standard grade after 1932 is 1.75 taels higher than before.</p>
<p>From the above table, the relationship between the world's cotton sales and cotton prices in recent years is clearly visible. At present, the prices of various cottons, compared with the second half of 1933, American cotton is higher than its highest price; Indian cotton and Shanghai standards are lower than their highest prices, slightly close to their average high and low prices. Compared with the first half of 1932, the price of American cotton has almost doubled, while the prices of Indian cotton and Chinese cotton are not as high as their highest prices at that time. Therefore, the current price of American cotton is higher than that of Indian cotton and Chinese cotton. The increase in American cotton consumption in recent years (especially the increase in China and Japan) is due to the cheap price and large supply of American cotton. Now, on the one hand, prices have risen sharply, and on the other hand, production is restricted to reduce supply. At the same time, the production of Indian cotton and Chinese cotton has increased, and prices are cheaper. Spinning mills will inevitably use less American cotton and more other cottons. The current world cotton trade has not made progress at an equal rate to the price of American cotton. More expensive cotton is certainly not welcomed by general spinning mills. If so, the above-mentioned estimated seasonal American cotton consumption will change due to price, or will be less than 14 million bales, and the end-of-season stock in the next season will not fall below 7 million bales. The price cannot be based on the season between 1929│30.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are many emerging cotton-planting countries in recent years. The United Kingdom is particularly striving to develop cotton planting in its territories. If the United States vigorously implements production reduction, other countries will not only feel the lack of American cotton supply but also suffer from the higher price of American cotton. They will be more willing to purchase cotton from other countries and further promote the progress of their cotton planting. If so, although American cotton restricts production, the total supply of raw cotton in the world will still not decrease significantly. The purpose of the United States to reduce production to adapt to consumption is bound to fail. Moreover, the stability of cotton prices depends on whether the world economy and cotton trade can be restored, which cannot be achieved by production reduction alone.</p>
<p>The international trade situation of the United States in recent years is also not very satisfactory. It relies on the export of bulk agricultural products to balance foreign trade. Cotton is the most prominent of agricultural products. Therefore, in terms of the American economy, production reduction may not be sustainable. Therefore, the term of the Peng production reduction plan was initially three years, and then changed to one year, which may also be due to this feeling. Therefore, we feel that the Peng Haide plan for American cotton production reduction is almost a kind of test with no certainty.</p>
<h3>Estimate of National Fabric Consumption Zixiu</h3>
<p>! Per person per year:: approximately eight and a half yards:: insufficient for two sets of short shirts and trousers!</p>
<p>The fabrics used by the majority of civilians in our country are almost all cotton cloth, except for ramie fabrics or straw fabrics used in southern regions during the summer and old sheepskin used in northern regions during the winter. The annual sales of high-end fabrics such as domestic silk, wild silk, rayon, and wool fabrics are estimated to be no more than 100,000 dan, and at most no more than 200,000 dan. If evenly distributed among the people of the whole country, it is negligible. Therefore, estimating fabric consumption may as well focus on cotton cloth. The consumption of cotton cloth in our country is estimated to be about 8.5 million dan per year based on the production and sales of machine-spun cotton yarn (1). The amount of hand-spun yarn is not included. This 8.5 million dan is probably slightly low. However, from various aspects, the output of hand-spun yarn is estimated to be only tens of thousands of dan per year, which seems to offset the items other than clothing made of cotton cloth. Therefore, the number of 8.5 million dan can be used as the net number actually used for clothing. According to this calculation, the population of our country is about 400 million, and the consumption per person is 2 jin and 2 liang. Ordinary coarse cloth is 40 yards long and 1 yard wide per piece, weighing 10 jin, that is, 4 yards per jin; 2 jin and 2 liang is exactly 8 and a half yards, or 8 and a half square yards. Eight and a half square yards of cotton cloth is not enough for two sets of short shirts and trousers. Some commentators may suspect that it is too low. Please verify it with a household survey.</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai workers use 11 square yards of cloth per person per year. According to the survey reports of the Peiping Social Survey Institute and the Shanghai Commodity Price Investigation Bureau in 1927-1928, the estimation details are as shown in the left table (2).</p>

<p>1 Shanghai chi equals 0.3893 yards, 132.25 Shanghai chi equals 51.48 yards. Divide by the average number of 4.62 people per household to get a consumption of 11.14 yards per person per year.</p>
<p>(2) Dingxian farmers use 8 and a half square yards of cloth per person per year, with some change. According to the survey report of the China Popular Education Promotion Association in 1928-1929, the estimation details are as follows (3).</p>
<p>(Clothing consumption per household) Quantity in original report Price in original report Estimated quantity of cotton cloth (unit: 1 chi, width based on 1 yard)</p>
<p>Local native cloth 86 chi 5.99 56.76 (width 1 chi 2 to 1 chi 8 cun, the size of the chi is added by 1 and converted at 66%)</p>

<p>Other 1.01 10.10 (1 jiao per chi)</p>
<p>Total 14.86 136.36</p>
<p>The commonly used ruler in Dingxian cloth trading is the tailor's ruler. 1 tailor's ruler equals 0.383 yards, 136.36 tailor's rulers equals 52.23 yards. Divide by the average number of 6.03 people per household to get a consumption of 8.66 yards per person per year, that is, 8 and a half square yards with some change. Shanghai is the first trading port in our country, and the consumption of workers is only 11 square yards per person per year. Dingxian is a cloth-producing area, and the consumption of farmers is only 8 and a half yards per person per year, with some change. Moreover, the situation of insufficient clothing in the barren areas of the Northwest is often seen in records. It can be seen that an average of 8 and a half square yards for the whole country is not a low estimate.</p>

<h3>Financial Sunday Financial Market Silent</h3>
<p>In recent days, due to the summer sluggishness of silver and money business, the activity of various items in and out of the market has generally shown nothing. However, because cash is difficult to concentrate and circulate, people who care about current affairs generally advocate prosperity. However, it is difficult for one tree to support the entire forest, and it is not easy to unite, and ultimately it has not been able to make up for one in ten thousand. Therefore, the market atmosphere has gradually weakened. Yesterday was a Sunday, a bank holiday, so the atmosphere was even more bleak. The foreign exchange rate still opened at six points, the same in the morning and afternoon. In the bill discount transaction, the morning market transfer was more than 3.1 million, the new transaction was more than 300,000, the afternoon market transaction was more than 200,000, the small general meeting transaction was more than 400,000, the Qianzhuang foreign public list received more than 35 million, the foreign exchange head had no receipt by the bank, the funds were stagnant, remittances from various routes were more than 200,000, banknotes were recovered more than 400,000, and more than 300,000 were redeemed from the Qianzhuang side for foreign deposits. The market price of subsidiary coins, the Jiangnan small foreign exchange was 815 yuan in the morning market, and the afternoon market increased by 3 yuan and 5 jiao to 818 yuan and 5 jiao, with 8,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small foreign exchange was 729 yuan and 5 jiao in the morning market, and 730 yuan and 0 jiao and 5 fen in the afternoon market, resulting in a better exchange rate of 1 yuan compared with the previous day, with 65,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were shortened by 500 wen to 329,000 wen, with 32,242 strings traded, equivalent to a price of 9,800 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<h3>Securities Bond Market Soared Last Week, Stable Situation: Favorable to Both Bull Sides Struggling: High Prices Repeatedly Appear</h3>
<p>Last week, from June 18 to June 23, the Chinese Securities Exchange,</p>
<p>In the last week of June futures, only one day next week remains, so the bulls and bears are struggling fiercely. The environment is favorable to the bulls. Since the discovery of the Tibetan capital, there has been no problem with the situation, and the opening of the railway will be implemented as scheduled. It is also heard that there is an investigation of the savings department reserves of various banks. The banking industry also took advantage of the half-year closing relationship to arbitrage and raise prices, and transactions broke out. Moreover, due to the high market prices, there were more and more shorts, rushing forward and succeeding one after another, and working harder and harder. I don't know how high the market price is, and it will continue to rise. New high prices emerge endlessly, and shorts are also exhausted. Most bonds are at least above 70% of their face value. The entire sixth period has always been in an unimportant position because the lottery has been drawn since 1936. Since the short-term gold price has soared, the bulls' eyes have shifted to the entire sixth period. It is estimated that the total value of the goods is only more than 31 million, which is less than any public debt. During the period of Anglian's custody, there was a fact that the lottery was not inclined. After several wars, there were many losses. In addition to the small ones that cannot be circulated as futures, it is estimated that there are actually only about 20 million yuan left. The chips are weak, and there are still many shorts. With a little support, breaking through the 70 yuan mark is extremely easy. The situation is not likely to have problems immediately, and the new tariff rate will be implemented soon. Although the future is still inevitable with huge ups and downs, the trend should still be rising. After last week, the situation was no problem on Monday. The market price rose throughout the day after buying numbers 5, 36, 48, and 50. The short-term gold and the entire sixth period rose especially strongly, each rising 1 yuan and 78 jiao. Demobilization, the 20th volume, the unified salt tax, and the short-term gold and the entire sixth period all saw new high prices. The unified salt tax was close to 70%. The situation on Tuesday seemed to be back to normal and failed. It was slightly chaotic, and the market price rose more and fell less, with the appearance of dark clouds but no rain. On Wednesday, retail investors and bulls slightly closed out. Demobilization fell by 67 jiao at most. Large rises and small corrections, large households remained stable and did not move. On Thursday, people's hearts turned strong again, and shorts rushed to cover their positions. The market price rose throughout the day again, and two or three new high prices were added. The trend was firm. Dismissal and the short-term gold and the entire sixth period both rose by more than 1 yuan. Arbitrage and swap transactions were extremely active, and the shorts were already in a tight spot. The situation on Friday did not weaken slightly. The opening price of the unified tax immediately rose by more than 1 yuan. The three rounds of the day rose even more strongly. Demobilization rose by 1 yuan and 4 jiao, and most bonds have generally found new high prices, breaking the highest record on April 2, which is also the best situation after January 28. Although there was a slight recovery on Saturday, it stopped in the afternoon. After the selling of large times such as numbers 46 and 48, the result was only a small decrease of 23 jiao to 1 yuan. Today is the last day of June futures, and the struggle is inevitable. In total, the market price last week rose by about 1 yuan to more than 3 yuan. In the near future, 96 still has the possibility of rising. The total number of transactions is 132,810,000 yuan for spot futures. The result of the rise and fall in the period is listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Reaction Rebounds Well</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: Yesterday (23rd), the stock market rebounded upwards in the last hour, led by silver stocks. However, there were no new developments in silver, so the recovery of silver stocks was only a technical rebound. The real reason for the market to rise was the general improvement in attitude towards automobiles, and the market sentiment also improved. Speculators are becoming more optimistic about the Securities and Exchange Commission, believing that the committee will be able to handle matters fairly, and customers and brokers will both benefit. Half-day transaction volume was 233,350 shares. According to a report from our firm's New York agent (securities), market sentiment is slightly firmer, but the market is still stagnant. (Wheat) After the bullish report on European harvest estimates was released, it triggered a large amount of new buying, and the market turned firm and rose. The public also participated, and market sentiment is bullish, making it easy for prices to rise. (Corn) Followed wheat in rebounding higher, with good buying opportunities next week. (Cotton) Most of today's transactions were for July futures being sold off, with spot trading absorbing them. Weather forecasts indicate good weather in cotton-producing areas, but drought and heat in Texas. According to another private telegram from New York, recent news of damage to cotton in the fields is an exaggeration and should not be paid attention to. The price increase still needs additional stimulus. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn, Flowers, American Cotton Lack Rain, Market Turns Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm due to lack of rain in drought areas, buying by fellow traders, and a shortage of sellers. As a result, spot prices rose by 5 pound-notes, and futures prices rose by 3 to 5 pound-notes. British cotton futures fell by 2 points. Indian cotton was firm due to buying by speculators and exporters. As a result, Pingguoer rose by 1 rupee, Aomula rose by 1 rupee and 2.5 annas, and Bailuoxi rose by 1.5 rupees.

<h3>Grain, River Rice Price Rise Not Strong</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs suddenly increased again, totaling 34 numbers of late rice, thick japonica, and 17-18 numbers of various varieties (totaling over 7,000 stones). Therefore, although the late rice was continued to be handled by Beiyang and Tianjin gangs for 4,000+ packages, the situation was quite active, but the problem of eating plates inevitably became inferior. The Qingjiao Songsi Silian and other goods that were removed continued to have a superior price, but as a result, they only rose by 6 points. The thick japonica of various gangs had a large amount of goods arriving, and the store stomach was slightly lax, so although the sellers still wanted to recover, the fact was that it was difficult to achieve, and it only presented a stable situation. (Du Yangjian Wuzhuorong Bianyuan was also average,</p>

The market's sales of white japonica are still tight, but the stores are slack, and the same is true for thin rice. The transactions of Baiyuan and Yang Dufu Kejian are few. The market situation of white japonica and thin rice has slightly risen and fallen. The price trend of Baiyuan Yang Dufu Kejian is stable. Now, the various prices sold are listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Sugar Market Road Goods Ho Chi Opens 500 Packages</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the new tariff, which has increased or decreased, transactions have been suspended for days.

<h3>Oil Market Asphalt Has Been Fixed</h3>
<p>Sales Have Fallen:: The Price Is Also The Lowest</p>
<p>Asphalt has reached the end of the season. In previous years, there were still soap factories using it, but this summer, it has been taken over by butter and coconut oil, resulting in a quietness in the market that has never been seen before. However, the price is ten yuan cheaper than in previous years, but it is still difficult for soap manufacturers to calculate, and it is true that the cheaper it is, the less people care about it. Since it once rose sharply a month ago, the Han market has gradually declined again. Chongjing has loosened to 14 yuan, Pingjing 13 yuan and 45 cents, Macheng around 13 yuan, Zhizhong 13 yuan 56 cents, and Wumuzhongji around 14 yuan. The inventory is still thick, but the cost is relatively high, and the Hakka people are unwilling to be cheaper. They want to increase the price as soon as there is a transaction, but the organizers still want to cut back, so the Han market has a situation of suddenly being popular and suddenly being tired. However, after twisting and turning, there is not much rise or fall, because the market has fallen to this point and the Hakka people are unwilling to be cheaper, and in fact, it is impossible. There are still many hand-picked goods in this port, and some people come to Shanghai to sell to candle makers, which is also a new look. However, now the candle makers have stopped their summer work, and even if it is cheaper, they cannot sell as they wish, but the business of the merchants in this port is even more difficult.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Random Talk on Reading, Writing, and Mass Language Literature</h3>
<p>— Ye Shengtao</p>
<p>What Mr. Ling　said in his article "The Future of Classical Chinese" yesterday was very incisive. He said: "Those who opposed vernacular Chinese in the May Fourth era are different from those who advocate classical Chinese today: the former would never accept vernacular Chinese, while the latter would certainly accept it as long as people can write vernacular Chinese in the style of the Four Books and Five Classics. It is only because it is impossible for those who want to write vernacular Chinese to write articles in the style of the Four Books and Five Classics that they still advocate classical Chinese. They also know that it is impossible to revive classical Chinese, but they think that at least they can urge people to read a little ancient books." What is the use of reading a little ancient books? At most, like them, they will trap themselves in the declining ebb tide, and at the same time give the advancing ships a little slight resistance. This is the real situation, but they are never willing to believe it. Their lives determine their consciousness. Starting from their consciousness to deal with educational problems, they cannot but come to such a conclusion, which is to pack the content and form of ancient books into the minds of young people. They think that doing so is the most reasonable, otherwise they will be sorry for the young people. We do not want to make any guesses, saying that they have other intentions and bad intentions. However, obviously, they have not realized that people are often changed by the environment, they have not realized that the changes in people's lives have never been as rapid and drastic as they are now, and they have not realized how unfortunate it is for individuals that life has changed, but other things that should have changed along with it have stagnated and not changed. There is no need to look far for examples of people who have suffered such misfortune. Just look at ourselves, although they are never willing to believe it.</p>
<p>If their wishes are realized, that is to say, in education, the content and form of ancient books are really packed into the minds of young people, what will be the result? That is easy to imagine: most young people are unwilling to let go of real life. In comparison, they feel that real life is not like this at all. They immediately throw out what has been packed into their minds, like throwing away a rotten apple that is not worth cherishing. What about a few young people? Perhaps because of special circumstances, they can write a few articles like the "On Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Sense of Shame, the Four Cardinal Principles of the State" written by the first-place winner of this year's Shanghai Municipal Middle School Entrance Examination. Throwing it out is not much different from never having packed it in, not to mention. Only the person who can write the first-place article can give the promoters some comfort, but this comfort is too weak. Therefore, the disappointment of the promoters is inevitable, and the factors of disappointment are contained in their consciousness.</p>
<p>Today's young people in school may really encounter such a day, when they are forced to be "packed" like this. Just look at some people holding weapons shouting "Pack it! Pack it!" and a group of strategists waving feather fans also echoing from the side "Pack it! Pack it!" and you can roughly know a little news. When young people encounter such a day, they will of course not understand the principles of ancient books, and they will definitely not be able to write classical Chinese. However, this is not a major disaster for young people. At most, it will make school education a blank page. After they leave school, or rather, they throw away the teachings and lessons of the school, they will build their consciousness from real life and write articles that are sufficient to express their consciousness. The only way to write fluently is to read books diligently, which is originally a ridiculous thing. It is especially meaningless to write fluently but only say something like a parrot. It must be rooted in real life for the article to be truly fluent and meaningful to write. As long as young people recognize this, even if they are forced to be "packed" like this, it doesn't matter, just like our grandmother reciting "Heart Sutra" and "Great Compassion Mantra" next to our ears and it has nothing to do with us. The "Mass Language Literature" recently proposed by several gentlemen in "Free Talk" should be the most practical tool in our real life. Mr. Hu Yuzhi further defined Mass Language Literature with both content and form, saying that this is literature that expresses the consciousness of the masses, which makes it especially easy to recognize. Except for those who hold weapons and those who wave feather fans, who is not one of the masses? Who does not need Mass Language Literature? The excluded minority is not satisfied with vernacular Chinese. They want to return to classical Chinese and read ancient books, which is correct according to their principles. However, the masses are also not satisfied with vernacular Chinese. They feel that vernacular Chinese is too empty and only replaces "of, le, ma, ne" with "zhi, hu, zhe, ye" without any consciousness. Literature must truly express the consciousness of the masses to be worthy of fulfilling the function of communicating emotions in society. Naturally, Mass Language Literature must be established through the efforts of the masses, and educators, linguists, writers, etc. must especially make special efforts. Among these "families,"</p>
<p>there are those who wave feather fans, and they are of course hopeless. We can only earnestly hope for that group who do not wave feather fans. Today (the 22nd), I saw Mr. Erye's "Separation of Words and Meanings" in the "Trends" column of the Zhonghua Daily, which analyzes the differences between languages and is a precise and thorough article. We hope that various "families" will write more such articles now that "Mass Language Literature" has just been proposed.</p>
<h3>Early Summer Twilight</h3>
<p>— Shao Guanhua</p>
<p>The moon is watching me,</p>
<p>I am holding the moon,</p>
<p>Watching summer coolness penetrate the branches,</p>
<p>A piece of sand</p>
<p>Cool air splashed on the roof ridge,</p>
<p>Half of the roof shadow moves towards the wall,</p>
<p>I take a walk at twilight,</p>
<p>Quietly watching twilight,</p>
<h3>Beiping and Camels</h3>
<p>— Lin Xi</p>
<p>I am a person who loves Beiping. When I talk to many friends about Beiping, they all feel that Beiping is lovely: but the reasons for its loveliness, they each have their own ways of saying it. Those who have been to Beiping say that Beiping's food, clothing, housing and transportation are how well suited to their economic situation. A blue cloth gown costing two or three yuan can be worn for all seasons. A rickshaw ride costing one or two dimes can take you a dozen miles, and the puller is so steady and agile, making the ride more comfortable than the vehicles there. As for food, "Dong Lai Shun" and "Run Ming Lou," if you are willing to spend three or two dimes, you can eat sea cucumbers, ham, pork kidneys: etc., foods that are not often eaten. This is probably something you can't eat anywhere else. There is no need to talk about housing. Beiping people love to decorate. As soon as you enter the door, there are three or two pomegranate flowers, oleanders, and western powder lotuses, which are both simple and lovely. Turning past the red gate of "Zhai Zhuang Zhong Zheng," there are all kinds of flowers and plants with a northern flavor, such as peaches, lilacs, cannas, and elm-leaf plums, which are fascinating. However, this kind of place, with twenty or thirty rooms and one or two large courtyards, costs only twenty or thirty yuan a month to rent; compared to living in a pigeon coop for seven or eight yuan in Shanghai and other places, there is a world of difference.</p>
<p>As for those who have not been to Beiping, they always yearn for the emperor's residence, what the tiles of the Forbidden City look like; what the Forbidden City, the Imperial River Bridge, Kunming Lake, and Taiye Pond look like; how many schools there are, how simple the residents are, without the oily and slippery energy of the coastal people. They all have their own reasons, if you talk about the specific symbol, I think it is still the camel. Those who wear camel hair may not feel the docile nature of camels; those who live in Beiping may not know how camels are like Beiping.</p>
<p>Some people say that to know the benefits of Beiping, you have to live in Beiping for some years: there is some truth in this. An American missionary who had lived in Beiping for five or six years said to me: When I first arrived in Beiping, I simply hated Beiping to death. The spring and winter winds blow so much dust that it covers the sun, and you can't even breathe; as soon as the trees sprout, the sun scorches the stray dogs on the street, sticking out their tongues, and manure carts on the asphalt road stink up several streets: but now it's much better, I really love the autumn frost and fallen leaves, I'm used to hearing the bugle calls at dusk, the sobs of trains outside the city in the morning fog, and the cries of hawkers late at night; finally, his conclusion is: Beiping is one of the most poetic cities in the modern world.</p>
<p>But he still didn't see the camel.</p>
<p>The camel, such a huge animal, walks with its long legs, with such a pause, such a pause; its long neck moves bit by bit; the fatty hump wobbles so much that it can really irritate people with impatient personalities. But this is also Beiping, and after being separated from Beiping for more than ten years and then returning to Beiping, you can't see much change: Shanghai has added many Western-style buildings, Nanjing has added many government offices, but Beiping is still Beiping, still gray, old (not necessarily grayer or older.)!! This is like the camel's pace, always so slow and steady.</p>
<p>No matter how lacking in nostalgia you are, when you stand face to face with the old and strong enemy building outside the city gate, if you don't think of the ancient general singing "Looking at the Enemy Building," you will also wonder how the building was built in the first place; it is so majestic, so gray, standing firm and seeing through the past and present. At this time, if there is a camel team, ringing dull bells, strolling over from the willows under the ancient city: the camel drivers, dressed in head-to-toe blue that matches their skin, pulling the long rope and accompanying the camels to stroll: you look at the ancient enemy building, the city walls, and the animals that walk a hundred or eighty miles without raising their heads in contrast, it will really make you unconsciously regard yourself as a city wall on the ground, or a flying eaves on the ancient enemy building.</p>
<p>Qianmen is the most prosperous place in Beiping. Besides the two train stations, there are two streetcar lines under the ninety-nine-foot Zhengyangmen that rumble day and night. There are cars from 1934 rushing back and forth. The bells of rickshaws never stop pouring into the ears of pedestrians; but there are also Ming Dynasty carts, rolling up dust, strolling quite quickly from the Qianmen Bridge: even more interesting are the camel teams, no matter how noisy or anxious you are, the animal always maintains its composure, taking one step at a time.</p>
<p>So I said: To know the benefits of Beiping, you have to watch the camels under Zhengyangmen. Beiping is not Old Jerusalem, not Ancient Rome, not Paris, not London, Beiping is Beiping.</p>
<p>Speaking of the camel's boldness, perseverance, and simplicity, it seems that one has to think of the great plains of the north, the cold winds outside the Great Wall, and the kind people who live in the wind and sand.</p>
<p>In Beiping, the ancient city and buildings are always gazing at the camels; the camel hair has fallen, and the treetops are green; the camel hair has grown, and the autumn wind brings coolness; it is always like this.</p>
<h3>Not a Funny Story</h3>
<p>— Xicun</p>
<p>This is not a funny story, but a fact, although funny stories also contain elements of fact.</p>
<p>The fact is this: it's said that recently in the Northeast, some large cities (like Changchun, Shenyang, Harbin, Jilin, Andong, Dalian) have set up something called "dog kennels," a type of killing device. A group of wolf-dog hybrids (said to be ten times more ferocious than regular wolf-dogs) are kept in a "kennel." Initially, they are fed pork and beef, but later they are fed human flesh.</p>
<p>The source of this human flesh is travelers passing through the area. As long as the military and police authorities deem them "not good people" and guilty of "harming the new nation," the charge is immediately established. If the traveler cannot find a guarantor in the area, well, regardless of the circumstances, a perfectly healthy person is seized, and thrown into the "dog kennel," thus ending their life.</p>
<p>It is said that many travelers have died in the "dog kennels," but this is only the beginning. Who knows how many people will enter the kennels in the future!</p>
<p>Can this fact be regarded as a funny story? Can it be told to others as a funny story? No, this is not a funny story, but a complete demonstration of the vicious methods used by Japanese imperialism to slaughter innocent and weak ethnic groups. At the same time, it can also be said to be an advancement in killing techniques. A few days ago, news from the Northeast in the newspapers showed us a new invention of Japanese imperialism for killing: the "human-strangling machine." It is said that the method of killing is to "first use heavy money to buy off rogue traitors and opium addicts and morphine addicts to go everywhere to find the righteous army temporarily hiding in various places, or enlightened young people. Anyone who refuses to be sent by the Japanese is considered to have 'anti-Manchukuo behavior'," so they are caught and pushed into the "human-strangling machine." If we carefully compare the two, both involve killing, but they are different: the latter requires some investigation before killing (no matter how the investigation is conducted, it should be said to be rare), and strangling people requires some time and personal effort. As for the former, how convenient! Seizing people does not require investigation, and killing people only requires the use of ferocious beasts. It seems that those imperialists consider it beneath them to directly kill a small number of slaves.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the future, this "not a funny story" will really become a "funny story," because such facts are very likely to increase.</p>
<h3>Fog</h3>
<p>— Gorky, Recently Translated by Yixian</p>
<p>A yellow-gray, damp haze permeated the city, like wet smoke, if smoke could be wet. Five steps in front of you, the moisture seems so thick, even so solid, that it seems there is no air there at all!! Undoubtedly, the air must be buried in this dim yellow dampness. But when you walk into it, as if into some fog, you only find it difficult to breathe, and your eyes lack energy.</p>
<p>All the sounds of the big city are strangely merged into a monotonous, ambiguous roar: occasionally there is the rare sound of a car horn; sometimes you hear the even rarer sound of a human voice, but only because you were hoping to hear it. The bronze bell has lost its melodious tone. The bell sound does not slowly fade away as usual, but stops abruptly, as if someone put a hat over the bell tower every time the bell rings. The steam whistle of the ship is also weak, as if the ship does not want to risk venturing into the fog, or is a bit tired of it.</p>
<p>Inside and outside this fog, sweating streetcars and vehicles drawn by horses that look like they are coated in oil are speeding by. The soaked pedestrians are strangely silent; they shrug up their coat collars; their hands are deep in their pockets, and they lean their heads forward, walking back and forth with large strides, their hurried manner suggesting the urge to escape some disaster. The fog has imprisoned them in translucent bubbles!! People in these bubbles are like egg yolks in egg white.</p>
<p>Two elderly ladies huddled against the damp wall strain to hold up a large black umbrella, the edge of which bumps into a short, fat man, who cries out!! At this time, the two elderly ladies, like mechanical toys, wave their hands in the same gesture, then tremble all over, uttering sentences composed entirely of exclamations.</p>
<p>The shop windows and the walls of the houses are covered with damp dust. Everything seems to be melting, with soft outlines, as if made of unclean ice seen in the spring. Our imagination and fantasies play together. What if even astronomers did not know that the sun had exploded, the dead moon had melted, and that large mass of dilute liquid, cold to the temperature of fresh milk, then surrounded the earth with a suffocating, gas-like dampness, with the inexplicable, moist corruption corroding the muddy earth? This big city, inhabited by millions of people, has already begun to melt, and before long, its stones, glass, metal, and wood will all be quietly flowing in thick currents, and these will evaporate into yellow-gray smog...</p>
<p>However, the people in this city soon dispel the hallucinations of their excited imaginations. The first thing that awakens us is the police:!! Figures cast from a mold, like stone statues, their actions characterized by mechanical precision and composure. All the police on the streets are the same, and people are frightened and wary of that power, the power of the most elite robbers on earth, the "aristocratic group," used to deprive people of their humanity through culture.</p>
<p>The hand of the police, the powerful lever that maintains order, summons cars, trucks, and horse-drawn carriages from the fog, or sends them into the fog, making everyone believe that the end of this great city has not yet come. Cars drive toward the doorways of houses and stores full of lights and dry warmth, and from those cars step gentlemen who are either too stiff or too fat, wearing top hats. The gentlemen courteously and arrogantly offer their arms to their noble wives. The women laugh, not entirely unpleasantly: their porcelain doll-like faces displaying a disdainful look, they touch the damp asphalt road with their delicate feet. The stores swallow them, like old people swallowing strong oysters.</p>

<h3>Survival Education</h3>
<p>— Mingtang</p>
<p>According to reports, the Director of Education of Shandong Province, He Siyuan, has been vigorously implementing "survival education" in recent years, actively expanding vocational schools, with the aim of enabling students to have job skills after graduation and preventing rural children from changing their living environment, in order to overthrow the so-called scholar-official education. This is indeed a very interesting thing.</p>
<p>Scholar-official education must indeed be overthrown. Survival education should be vigorously promoted. However, we cannot help but have a question: Will simply vigorously promoting survival education and shouting slogans to overthrow scholar-official education guarantee that students will all get good jobs after graduation and not face unemployment? This is a very debatable issue.</p>
<p>The formation of scholar-official education was originally not because survival education was not promoted before, but because society simply does not allow people to survive. What does this mean? Well, let's see: Where in today's society are we allowed to survive? The countryside is bankrupt, the cities feel overpopulated, and all industries and all economic life have fallen to an extremely tragic and declining state. In such an environment, what is the use of survival education? Even if we want to survive, where can we go to survive? Therefore, this is a fundamental problem of society, and not something that a mere survival education can solve. If the fundamental problem of society is not solved, no matter how vigorously survival education is promoted, the result will probably be futile. The facts have proven this to us. In recent years, although the government has tried its best to prohibit the establishment of university liberal arts departments, tried its best to crack down on liberal arts students, and encouraged engineering students, the result is that the number of students studying liberal arts is still relatively large. This shows that it is useless to start from education alone, and that we must start from the fundamentals of society to achieve results. Education is only one of the superstructures of the entire society. Without changing the fundamental social system, this superstructure is simply impossible to transform piecemeal. What do the people who have always advocated saving the country through education and promoting vocational education think of this opinion?</p>
<p>To actively implement survival education, there is at least one prerequisite: to first ensure that students can survive after graduation. For example, those who study engineering must be able to get a job after graduation. Those who study agriculture must be able to do agricultural work after graduation, and so on. Only by promoting survival education in this way can there be hope of success, and only by promoting survival education in this way can it be considered true survival education. Otherwise, starting from empty education alone will probably be useless.</p>
<h3>Two Partners</h3>
<p>— Gongtian</p>
<p>The sound of the waves beside the Songhua River truly contains infinite poetry. Especially on a quiet night, when the gentle breeze ripples the water, reflecting the shimmering moonlight... She is tired from being disturbed by people during the day, and takes advantage of the time when people are asleep to desperately gasp for a few breaths: "Wham!" crashing onto the shore. How at peace the fish are! They are already asleep. They do not want to look at the moon struggling to break free from the clouds.</p>
<p>The Jiangqiao Bridge stands there as lifeless as death, seemingly unaware of where the future event will erupt! It is still being pressed down by two elongated tracks. Only the water constantly "Wham!" crashes against it, as if warning it of the terror of the future event! The two old soldiers guarding the bridge are not dozing off at this time. They are quietly waiting for orders, holding their guns and staring blankly into the distance. At the same time, two more Japanese soldiers have been added. They do not speak, all silently preparing for the future event. At this time, the lights in the fort have also dimmed. In the silence, one can still hear the mysterious sound of the water.</p>
<p>Damn it! It had to be our shift. Something had to happen.</p>
<p>!1 Who doesn't say so, Old Niu! If something happens</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>happens, we'll turn around and run!</p>
<p>The two Japanese soldiers had already put on their helmets, and their shiny bayonets were extended! How majestic! He glanced at them, and, oh! : : snickered a few times. Old Niu, who spoke first, glared at them as if he couldn't stand it, and then said, "Damn it!"</p>
<p>"Bang! Bang!" After two whistles, they each lay down and crouched on the sleepers, extending their guns out! Everyone's face was exceptionally pale and alert. "Bang! Bang! : :" The Japanese soldiers opened fire! They remained silent. Only Old Liu occasionally peeked at the weapons they were using. "Kill! Kill!" Shouts and gunfire merged into one. Groups of people automatically gathered together, holding muskets, wooden sticks, broadswords, torches: : : shouting slogans and rushing toward the fort. Instantly, the quiet night was filled with the sounds of killing, shouting, and gunfire. Old Niu and Old Liu quickly jumped off the sleepers and hid behind the bridge pillars. The other side opened fire! Bang! Bang! : :</p>
<p>"Boom! Boom!" Then some of the people in front were tragically killed by the artillery fire. But they still did not retreat a single step. They were still attacking, and their momentum was even greater. "Bang! Bang! : :" The gunfire continued to fire. !! Old Liu! Let's send these two home first! After saying this, Old Liu nodded and "Bang! Bang! Bang! : :" fired at them at the same time. The two fell into the river, and soon the river returned to calm. There was no trace, as if nothing had happened. Old Niu laughed "Ha! Ha!" He forcefully pushed Old Liu. !! It's really great! Old Liu shouted and laughed too. "Boom! Boom!" The artillery sounded again, and another row of people was sacrificed! In the light of the torches: the dark earth flashed red. The blood-filled water was filled with corpses. The next row shouted and rushed up!</p>
<p>"Woo! Woo! :;" Airplanes! Airplanes! They shouted in unison and lay down, scattering and crawling to attack, constantly shouting in their mouths, "Kill! Kill! Charge up!"</p>
<p>!! Old Liu! We "might as well go all the way," damn "Manchukuo." Aren't those corpses lying in the blood all Chinese? Let's seize the fort! Old Niu's face obviously changed. He said all these words in one breath, and then pulled Old Liu's sleeve and climbed onto the sleepers, running toward the fort!</p>
<p>"Kill the Japanese!" They shouted in unison, attacking the fort in the artillery fire.</p>
<p>"Bang! Bang! : :" They opened fire. Old Niu attacked inside, and the lights inside went out in an instant! At this time, their hearts were trembling violently, but they were still searching for their enemies! Old Liu felt his way up to the second floor, but was shot dead by the Japanese soldiers with two shots! At the same time, Old Niu was also hit by a bullet! They died like this. "Kill! : :" How close this sound is! Right outside the fort! The Japanese soldiers guarding the fort were all scared and hid. They charged up! They completely won! But at the same time, they were all seriously injured. In the darkness, they tore up the "Red, Blue, White, Black, Yellow" flag! And replaced it with the Blue Sky White Sun! The flag waved a few times in the darkness! They all showed the glory of victorious smiles! And fell dead under the "Blue Sky White Sun."</p>
<h3>Wanderer</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>He did not want to recall the past, nor did he dare to foresee the future; he seemed to feel that the past and the future both contained fierce things that would intoxicate and wound his romantic reality. He often said in a self-comforting tone:</p>
<p>"No woman, I have no reputation, I have no career, I have no money! I have nothing to entangle my body and mind and deprive me of my freedom: I can just wander and roam on this short journey." He embraced a strong presentism, encountering an unconstrained romantic life. He never knew how to consider life's security. His only view of life was "Drink today while you have wine today."</p>
<p>He had also suffered from the hardship of hunger and the coercion of cold, but these small waves in life could not affect his entire outlook on life.</p>
<p>Spring night! Beautiful spring night! Spreading a gentle smile, secretly descending to earth.</p>
<p>He felt under his filthy pillow for the manuscript fee he had received from the X Bookstore during the day, put on his shoes with holes in the soles, put on his greasy old felt hat, and, with a triumphant step, launched his attack on the bustling Shanghai.</p>
<p>He strolled through the cool park and the brightly lit dance halls. Ah! Those couples kissing sweetly under the trees, and the men and women embracing and dancing wildly on the smooth floor, all made him jealous and cursed.</p>
<p>Ah! Ah! Shanghai! Evil Shanghai! Love exchanges are opened everywhere. Where can you not find the comfort of sex and flesh?</p>
<p>He felt the silver coins earned from his brainpower in his pocket and began to seek the intoxication of flesh.</p>
<p>On the quiet streets, under the dim and sparse lights, a large number of flesh were displayed, waiting for customers to patronize. They wore bright clothes of scarlet red and dark green, and their faces were covered with thick white powder and red rouge. Their flowing, captivating eyes were also flirting with passersby. How could they not be as good as those in the parks and dance halls?</p>
<p>Ah! Are these selling flesh to greet customers? Why do they sell their flesh? What do they get in exchange? Ah! Bread! Bread to feed themselves!" He pondered to himself, and also thought of those in the parks and dance halls who let people caress and embrace them: Why? It's all for bread!</p>
<p>He no longer envied or cursed. He felt the silver coins in his pocket, just like the people in the parks and dance halls. He saw them striding into a filthy alley. He tried what he called the first "new pleasure" of his life.</p>
<p>The east was slightly tinged with fish-white, and the spring breeze softly blew toward the people.</p>
<p>After a night of romantic life, spending the price of his brainpower in his pocket, he emerged dazedly from the dirty and narrow alley. But he suddenly thought of the terrible future. He could not abandon himself like this. He was still young! On the way home, he made his leather shoes stomp loudly, as if he was reproaching his own heart.</p>
<h3>Danger</h3>
<p>— Sanduo</p>
<p>"The road is like a tiger's mouth, you can't walk in the middle!" Shanghai is full of dangers, and life is often hanging on the line between life and death. Whether one can bring one's life back when going out today is something no one can predict. Although it is said that those who lose their lives in the tiger's mouth are all rural people who have just arrived in Shanghai, there are also those who are too old in Shanghai who carelessly send their lives into the tiger's mouth; moreover, the signs on Avenue Joffre may break your head, and the bungalows in the playground may crush you into meat sauce. Pay more attention, electric wires hang down from mid-air, and inexplicable gunshots ring out. People after all do not have the talent to become bats. As the old ladies say, it is destined in your life and is unavoidable! So everyone wants to sit in a car and charge around recklessly. It's not my business if other people's lives roll under my car, but in car accident news, that life may not be a safe jacket.</p>
<p>Today, people are losing their lives in even stranger ways. Have you not heard of Pu Jinghong dying from a perm? Now, uniquely, electric perms have also set a new record. Although only one newspaper published an unconfirmed news item, I have already found out that it is undoubtedly true. Originally, someone had told a joke that haircuts are the most dangerous thing. If the barber is my enemy, his shiny razor only needs to be lightly swiped across my neck to be more than enough to end my life; moreover, putting the head of a flesh and blood body into that frame and then subjecting it to fifteen minutes of electrocution to pile the hair on the head like a magpie's nest. What beauty is there? To pay five dollars as the price for sending away a life is truly the height of foolishness.</p>
<p>Today, the road in front of my house is being repaired, and "Danger" is written on the scaffolds on both sides. A red light is being blown away by the wind, and my heart feels uneasy.</p>
<h3>Perms and Foot Binding</h3>
<p>— Ms. Jiong</p>
<p>The inherited traditional concepts are tightly bound to everyone's heart, and the feudal ideas have not yet achieved a fundamental destruction of the existing system. The progress of most careers is only manifested in inheriting the past and copying the old ways, so the pain of women's perms and foot binding is no different. The same thing is that in an unsound system, they are expressing their own stupidity! As well as harming their own health and happiness.</p>
<p>In previous eras, women, under the deep feudal forces, had no so-called liberation at all, and did not know what liberation was themselves, but spent all day playing with things, living in the hell of being dominated. In order to make themselves pleasing to men, they had to think of all sorts of ways, endure their own pain, and give men joy and appreciation. So women's foot binding came with the condition of wanting to please men. At that time, we only heard cries of sorrow everywhere; parents, in order to compete for face, had to endure the pain of their daughters and still tightly bound a pair of natural, healthy feet. And the daughters themselves feared that they would not be liked by a man in the future, and would be ridiculed by their neighbors. Although they felt unbearable pain, iron-like feudal ideas, like shackles, locked their bodies and minds, and in the end there was nothing they could do!</p>
<p>When the European wind gradually blew eastward, the call for women's liberation slowly responded with this trend, so the general old and corrupt ideas were also shattered by the fierce advance of this era! The pain of foot binding has also decreased day by day.</p>
<p>Although new tricks continue to emerge to oppress the future of women's liberation, replacing the old pain of women's foot binding and standing in sharp contrast to it. It is the now popular perm. Foot binding is the pain of the lower part of the body, affecting the development of the whole body and the health of the body, and is perm not the same? The stimulation makes the brain dizzy, and some people get blisters all over their bodies and their skin becomes red and swollen because of ordinary perms. There are even those who lose their lives because of perms, such as Ms. Pu Jinghong, who caused a sensation a few years ago. We know that in this era of high-sounding calls for women's liberation, in reality, the pain suffered by women has not been reduced by much? Both damage the health and development of the body. In short, the pain suffered by women's perms and foot binding can be said to be rolling in the same trap! For the joy and appreciation of men! Therefore, if we want to forever and thoroughly unlock this trap, women must shatter traditional ideas and make real efforts to seek liberation from the establishment of careers.</p>
<h3>A Daughter Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces</h3>
<p>— Mu Lin</p>
<p>The Huang residence was as chaotic today as if some major event had occurred. Except for the rickshaw pullers and cooks, who restlessly smoked in the living room, everyone else was upstairs, frantically rushing about. The phone had been rung twice, but the savior they urgently needed had yet to arrive. After being senselessly scolded by the master, Huang Ma, as if it were her due, hurried downstairs with her bound feet. Seeing the two men smoking, she couldn't help but feel a nameless fire rise within her.</p>
<p>"Why hasn't the doctor arrived yet?" she scolded, much like the master.</p>
<p>"We're waiting for him!" the two replied cautiously, as if it were their duty.</p>
<p>"The master is extremely anxious! Go to the entrance of the alley and see if you've mistaken the house number!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, the doorbell rang, and the three ran to open the door as if in a race. Outside stood a doctor they recognized and two women in white coats, each carrying a bag. Before the visitors could speak, Huang Ma grabbed the doctor's hand and said as she walked:</p>
<p>"The mistress has gone through it twice already, the master is extremely anxious! Doctor Wang, please come upstairs with me."</p>
<p>At the top of the stairs, the master stood with his hands tucked into his sleeves. Seeing the doctor arrive, he repeatedly bowed and said, "Doctor Wang, thank you for your trouble, please come in." He hurriedly stepped aside to allow the three doctors into the inner room.</p>
<p>Doctor Wang nodded confidently, pushed open the door to the inner room, and a woman's scream, as if being crushed by something, emanated from within. The master unconsciously stamped his feet repeatedly, wanting to peek inside, but Huang Ma closed the door with her back to him. Inside, only faint moans and the sound of hurried footsteps could be heard. The master paced back and forth at the top of the stairs, helpless. Though anxious, a hope pulled him back from despair. His footsteps involuntarily stopped, and he thought to himself: "If a boy is born, I can live here freely and naturally. Didn't my wife say, 'If you want a concubine to guarantee a son, then go ahead and take one'?"</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he happily resumed pacing.</p>
<p>Suddenly, two heads appeared at the top of the stairs, startling the master. It was rickshaw puller A-Fu and cook Li Xing, tiptoeing up.</p>
<p>"What are you doing, acting like ghosts?" The master's hope was scared away by them, and he naturally scolded them in a bad mood. "Is the mistress doing well?" the two asked softly.</p>
<p>The master didn't answer. Another scream came from inside, and several people chattered noisily. The master understood in his heart. He peeked into the doorway, like a condemned prisoner. His heart hung far away in the sky, and he stood on tiptoe, pressing his ear to the door. A-Fu and Li Xing also exposed their entire bodies above the stairs, mouths wide open, hoping for something that was actually unrelated to them.</p>
<p>After the sounds inside subsided slightly, Huang Ma peeked out. The master's face suddenly became so serious, his gaze darting around the room as if capable of changing direction. Huang Ma wore a smiling face, her bound feet stepping lightly, afraid to put too much weight on them, and said: "Congratulations, Master, a daughter!"</p>
<p>The master's golden hope was shattered. He thought Huang Ma had misspoke. "A girl?" Actually, the master's words were unspoken, but Huang Ma understood his meaning from his expression. "Yes, Master, a daughter." After replying, she ran back into the room.</p>
<p>The master's body seemed to sink. He felt a suffocating pressure, and he also wanted to let out such a miserable scream. Turning his head, he saw A-Fu and Li Xing still standing at the top of the stairs. As if finding an object to vent his anger on, he stamped his foot and scolded:</p>
<p>"Why haven't you rolled back down yet!"</p>
<h3>Random Musings</h3>
<p>— Tao Shi</p>
<p>▲Now, with all sorts of faces, if everyone looks back and thinks about their past circumstances, they will definitely put on a different appearance.</p>
<p>▲"Weal and woe we share," but when it comes to matters of personal gain or loss, this saying becomes an exception.</p>
<p>▲Sensuality, thighs, buttocks—night after night, embracing dancers and kissing them madly, then dressing in a plain blue gown in the morning and talking grandly about a frugal lifestyle.</p>
<p>▲Donning a fashionable Western suit made of imported goods and stepping onto the lecture platform, he advocates for domestic products with every word.</p>
<p>Filled with ardent patriotism.</p>
<p>▲Beating the children every day, but not allowing them to cry out, saying that filial piety comes from the rod.</p>
<p>▲Treading the path of starvation, making a living as a "pig driver," then returning home in the evening and putting on airs in front of his wife.</p>
<p>▲His wife rents a small house with others and is still called a virtuous wife and good mother, rare in the world.</p>

<h3>The Joy of Reading</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>This seems to have become my philosophy of life. But only when I am poor.</p>
<p>In prosperous times, of course, I wouldn't think of this level, honestly, what's needed is enjoyment. However, when poverty strikes, I forget everything, everything that exists in my mind, there are only the two words "reading." From morning to night, and night after day, I read until I am spirited and do not feel any fatigue. In such a situation, there is a grand momentum of "I can go without food, but I cannot go without books!" Although, I also know that reading may not be able to fill the ravine of my appetite; but the comfort it gives me in times of poverty is a fact that I experience every time. My reading is not limited to types or subjects, as long as it is a book, I read it, and one time is not enough, I always read it three or four times, even more than ten times, until I understand the contents of the book before letting go. However, there are also books that I do not read, such as erotic books and sexual histories. This is not to boast that my character is noble, but because at my age, I don't need to read them yet; right? There are many books waiting for me to read in the library.</p>
<p>I don't have money to buy books, so I go to my friends to borrow them,</p>
<p>In short, I will never stop reading just because I don't have books to read.</p>
<p>Finally, I still hope that I will always be a poor boy, so that I can always find the joy of life in books. Friends! Do you know? The only joy in life is reading.</p>
<h3>Jottings from the Not-Humorous Studio</h3>
<p>— Wen Yuan</p>
<p>Old men wear colored glasses to look at things, and only say that everything now has changed.</p>
<p>Money has buried many talents who could have developed deeply, and instead has produced many traitors and robbers.</p>
<p>Present satisfaction may be future disappointment.</p>
<p>In a woman's smile, how much of the component is a man's tears.</p>
<p>Making friends with money is better than buying more books to read, because friends can only share your difficulties with him.</p>
<p>People use the ruler of prejudice to measure young people, so they do not get satisfaction, because there is no fair standard.</p>
<p>Young people, do not commit suicide. If you put on the telescope of effort to look at it, then you will feel that life is a colorful world, making you have three points of nostalgia.</p>
<p>In the streets and alleys full of fecal odor, is the Shanghainese's start of the day lies in the morning,</p>
<p>The lives of the poor, the money of the rich, are not worth much, but sometimes, money is more precious than life.</p>
<p>Only when there is no money to use do you feel the joy of having money in your hand, but the rich do not think of the suffering of the poor. The true nature of mankind can only be revealed when everyone is on the road to death.</p>

<h3>The Chaste Mother Memorial Arch (10)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The rice harvesting season is usually very busy in the countryside. In the Zheng Fu Gong family, although it is a family of scholars for generations, the twenty acres of fields in Bensaka still have to hire long-term workers to cultivate, so for the past three days, four or five people have been going to the fields every day, not to mention anything else, just being busy with cooking is tiring enough. After lunch, the long-term workers all went to take a nap as usual. Although the aunt is one of the most beautiful girls within thirty miles, regardless of whether she is also called a talented woman, when it comes to this dog days of summer, being busy with drying the grain is still her most important responsibility. Fortunately, the gray hen also steals time to help, otherwise she simply has no way to deal with it. Only Shi Min is doing nothing. Because he got up too early in the morning, he is now quietly lying on the bamboo bed under the corridor and sleeping, with his mother sitting next to him fanning him with a cattail leaf fan.</p>
<p>On a hot afternoon, there was not a trace of wind. Even the leaves in front of the steps were suffocated and dared not move. The heat was as if a big fire was evaporating underground. An old male dog, covered in a thick and heavy gray fur, hid in the shade of the flower bed and lay down, sticking out its tongue and panting desperately. Quietly, everything was suffocated and there was no sound, even the sparrows in front of the eaves refused to occasionally call. Only the sound of the aunt using a wooden stick to rake the bamboo sieve in the rice field monotonously tore through this deathly silence. She also felt limp and sleepy. Not long after, she saw her aunt return from the rice field. She untied her printed cloth headscarf while snatching the cattail leaf fan from her sister-in-law's hand and fanning herself non-stop. After all, she was a young girl, and also a daughter of a scholarly family, unwilling to easily unbutton her clothes to cool off her sweat. Bean-sized drops of sweat flowed from her forehead to her nose, and then dripped on the ground. Her sister-in-law said:</p>
<p>"Why don't you wear that ramie gown? It's a pity you're so hot."</p>
<p>"Who likes to wear ramie gowns? What do they look like? People can see the flesh."</p>
<p>"What does it matter? Anyway, we're just wearing it at home, and no guests are coming."</p>
<p>"I don't want to wear it, I'd rather die of heat than wear it, it's so embarrassing."</p>
<p>Her sister-in-law smiled slightly and said nothing more. After a while, her aunt went to the room to wash her face, and her sister-in-law took over the cattail leaf fan again to fan her son. His round, broad forehead was also sweating a few drops. So she used her sleeves to wipe the sweat from his forehead, but he was almost startled awake, tossing and turning, and then went back to sleep. His bare arms were marked with red marks from the bamboo bed. After a while, Hui Ji Po carried a carrying pole on her shoulder and walked past the corridor, preparing to go to the slope again. When he saw Shi Min sleeping, he immediately grinned, as if he was saying to himself:</p>
<p>"Hmph, this child, teaching other children in the archway park to knock off the heads of the Bodhisattvas on the archway to play with is really..."</p>
