<p>時評</p>
<h3>中歐糾紛之具體表現舒</h3>
<p>——意奥匈三國會商之展望——</p>
<p>意奥匈三國首相現已會晤於羅馬。在德奥邊境衝突正在激化軍縮會議難於打開之際。中歐風雲。乃隨而愈趨緊張。大有面臨戰爭前夕之感。蓋德意志自希特勒主政一年以來。拚命以國家主義激動一般人民歷史的傳統心理。挺進隊又高舉卍字旗章以轟動全德。使頻於危境之德人回復更新之希望。彼以爲即令此種辦法。未必大有裨於事實。然較諸無辦法者固已有望。其突擊之目的。盡人皆知其欲衝破凡爾賽和約之束縛。近之則擬乘機收回薩爾鑛區。遠則欲合同奥匈。重建第三帝國。此種理想。設使運用得法。未始非復興德國之一助。但自希特勒以反蘇聯自任之後。已使法蘇親近。德國反增加一困難。而愈有東顧之憂矣。</p>
<p>夫意德兩國。在理想上固相接近。緣同爲法西斯主義建立之國家。且德國科學發達。資本主義組織。益見緊密其需要海外市塲供給原料。輸出機械製品較諸世界戰爭以前。尤爲急劇。惜在歐洲大陸。爲法蘭西所扼制。海上則受英帝國之約束。勢惟有與意大利諒解之一途。惟意國國家主義之根本性質。厥爲對外侵略。以自國爲本位。外交上絶少國際合作之素質。是以德意關係。難期圓滿。意大利本蓄意爭覇中歐。對法國固欲爭一日之長。借小國以擴張其實力。而對德亦不肯任德國之自由發展。而坐受其禍。且奥國人民百分之九十四與德人同種同文。假令德奥合併成功。事實雖未必足以摧毁凡爾賽和約。而其聲勢確足令全歐震動。意大利爭覇之企圖。將被完全打破。故意國必須折服奥匈。使彼等爲意之前衛。則德國不能越境。卽小恊約國亦將受若干牽制。而法國在國際間。勢亦不能不爲意大利所用。由此以觀意固無從與德接近也。</p>
<p>在奥大利方面。初非無意與德合併也。祇因德國國社黨執政權而後。昧於國際情勢。不察德奥處境。一味硬趕。遂致引起奥國之反感。以奥國目前處境論既居四週强鄰監視之下。又純粹爲大陸國家。經濟上絶無轉旋餘地。惟有北賴德意志給與交通方便。經愛爾白河由漢堡出口。如不可能。則惟有南仗意大利假道。打開亞得利亞海之通路。或者尙可稍轉今日之危機。意相墨索里尼知其然。乃暗示意國對海上交通。有可與奥國通融之意向。如是則奥匈又焉得而不共趨於意大利耶。德國審知此種情况。於已國不利。故有開通愛爾白河與多腦河間運河之提議。借經濟互助以溝通小恊約國。并以消釋匈奥之反感。此誠德國政治上之唯一出路也。</p>
<p>論者皆謂中歐風雲。因意奥大軍集中邊境。和平前途。岌岌可危。戰爭爆發勢將不免。而在事實上。則勿論奥匈無力任戰。即德國亦不過虚張聲勢。其陸海軍實力。不及戰前之十一。且經濟力衰落。國民生活窘迫。又烏足以勝現代狂暴之戰鬭。以故今日中歐之爭特外交戰而已。意國旣占先着。德國自不肯過分落後。其積極凖備。當在意中。最近之將來，恐此外交戰將不免更形銳化而紛擾不已耳。</p>
<h3>羅馬談判進行中牛賴資欲行又止</h3>

<p>羅馬　意奥匈三國總揆雖屢傳不作政性治質的談話之說、但聞今日再集議時、將擬定一種重要的政治宣言、預料此項宣言、將與公報同時發表、公報所聲明者、爲意奥匈三國共同工作以謀中歐經濟恢復之决定、而宣言所聲明者、爲三國並無成立一個團體謀不利於其他中歐國家之意、但請求鄰國如德國·捷克·南斯拉夫·與羅馬尼亞等彼此合作、以謀解决、意國方面對於談話之進行、表示樂觀、聞意國關於稅則與進口執照兩點、凖備作大讓步、而奥匈亦將以同樣精神酬答之、（十六日路透社電）</p>

<h3>宴會酬酢幾無虚日</h3>

<p>、俱深信不疑、再則會議中間宴會酬酢、仍無日無之、今日意王特設筵欵待奥總理杜爾夫斯及匈總理貢博斯、意太子·意高級官員·以及各代表團·各隨員·奥匈駐在公使等均到、堪稱一時之盛、（十五日國民社電）</p>

<p>比京　參議院於討論外交問題之後、以八十五票對一票之多數、通過一種議程、内稱德國重整軍備、對於比國之威脅、愈見嚴重、政府應採取保障方法、以預防之云云、據消息靈通人士言、所謂保障者、係擬仿照法比同盟成例、再與英國訂立條約、以成立關於國防之「恊商」、此種條約如能成立、將於法國安全裨益匪淺、政府似同意進行此種政策、英國政府對於比國之意向、或亦知之、第兩國政府之間似尙未進行確切談判耳、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>金融界談上海商業危機</h3>
<p>銀錢業縮小往來</p>
<p>各業更週轉困難</p>
<p>滬市各商業、自感受一二八慘變以還、元氣本已虧耗、一時不易恢復、迄今兩載有奇、大部份商店、慘淡經營、勉維大局、但上年得新銀行風湧創設、爲擴充業務計、放欵方面、略事寬鬆、各商業賴以週轉、尙可勉强敷行、支撑殘市、詎今年廢歷歲首、金融界方面、爲上年業務影響、宣告清理者、固屬不少、卽照常營業者、鑒茲市面呆滯、奄無生氣、放欵情形、勢必互相戒備、審核精嚴、據該業中人言、上年</p>
<p>銀錢業、向各商店開做往來户頭、無論新舊、今年概須嚴格整飭、故此次元宵前後、往來開摺、驟减三分之二、（例如去年每莊有六百家户頭、今年不過開出二百餘户、若千家者、祇三百餘户而已）、故牌面稍次之店、週轉自是更難、旣無别法運用、不獲已而宣告清理者、比比皆是、然欲清理而有關大局之大商店、亦有數家、實在不能支撑、遂致房租積欠達十餘月之巨、法院爲顧全市面計、不肯徇債權之請而發封者、爲數更多、長此以往、就吾人金融界人自稱觀察、下月之緣繭汛、將無人問訊、而全滬大局、岌岌可危焉云云</p>

<h3>我國對法貿易</h3>
<p>尙能保持出超</p>
<p>我國對法貿易、向佔優勝地方、蓋法國輸出物品、以奢侈品爲多、但我國近年來、因經濟崩潰、購買力薄弱、故銷數頗狹、而我國出口貨、則以農産品礦物爲多、故尙能保持出超地位、爲我國對外貿易中最光榮之事件、惟以商人不知改進、致貿易日趨暗淡、大公社記者昨從有關方面、探得我國對法貿易情形、茲誌如下、</p>
<h3>我國對法貿易情形</h3>
<p>法國對華貿易向來不甚發達、良以頻年農村經濟破産、購買能力薄弱、故法國輸華貨物、如化妝品等奢侈品、均僅爲都市中婦女所光顧、致進口貨值、江河日下、而我國輸法貨物、則以農産品礦業爲多、均爲法國工業上所必需之物品、其他物品、則以商人不知改進、較前已减少、國内每多工業上之基本原料、法國屢次向我國當局調查、我國確地大物博、惜以無人注意、致未能推銷國外、</p>
<h3>兩年來之貿易比較</h3>
<p>法國運華貨值、在一九三二年總數爲九九·二六二·○○○法郎、一九三三年總數爲一三四·一五九·○○○法郎、我國輸出貨值總數爲二○九·八九一·○○○法郎、一九三三年總值爲二四四·八二○·○○○法郎、二年來進出口貨總值比較、我國出超一九三二年爲一一○·六二九·○○○法郎、一九三三年出超爲一一四·六六一·○○○法郎、</p>
<h3>進出口之主要物品</h3>
<p>法國輸華物品以金屬品爲最多　佔總值百分之三十五、次爲鋼板、估百分之十五、其次爲顔料、佔百分之七、化學品毛綫均佔百分之三、我國輸法貨物、以農産種子爲最多、佔總值百分之四十、花生次之、佔百分之十三、其他藤器佔百分之四、華茶則僅佔百分之一五、</p>
<h3>法徴收華茶進口稅</h3>
<p>我國對外貿易、向以絲茶爲大種、其輸法華茶爲值頗鉅、近年因種植不知改良、包裹不善致色香味均較以前稍差、又因外茶傾銷關係、故輸法華茶、近已大跌、去歲運法華茶、僅三百餘萬法郎、最近報載法政府更擬、徴收華茶進口稅、惟據法國駐滬商務參贊聲稱、尙未接到本國該項</p>
<p>命令、實業部國際貿易局、亦否認有此項消息云云、</p>
<h3>銀行界解釋存銀總數不連銀幣</h3>
<p>一萬五千萬兩專指銀條元寳</p>
<p>銀幣種類繁多流通數無統計</p>
<p>新聲社云自前日本市銀行家宣稱、全國存銀一萬五千萬兩之消息後、頗引起一般人之誤會、其實旣稱若干兩、當係僅指鑄造銀幣之元寳及大條而言、已鑄成之銀幣及銀具首飾等、自不在内、至銀幣數目、新舊龐雜、種類繁多、不易確切統計、故未列舉、若謂外商銀行存銀占三分之二、蓋因銀元與純銀成色不同、存儲銀條或元寳、較存儲銀元爲合算、非外商銀行含有操縱銀行之意也、茲就事實申述如下、</p>
<p>恐生誤會　昨日銀行界某要人對往訪之新聲社記者發表談話、表示報載一萬五千萬兩存銀之總數、固屬確鑿、但外間一般無智識者閱後、容易發生誤會、或致誤認該數字包含銀幣在内、難免引起社會上發生不良影響、因特聲明該數字不包含銀元、卽首飾等亦不在内、係專指所存之元寳或銀條而言、故該數字所稱之若于「兩字」、最爲明顯、蓋銀元等均不應稱兩也、至外商銀行所存之銀、達全數三分之二、蓋因銀元與純銀之銀條元寳、成色不同、存儲銀條或元寳、較存儲銀元爲合算、並非外商銀行多儲銀兩、卽含有操縱銀市之意、蓋其卽欲操縱、亦屬不可能凖備充實　中國各銀行所發行之鈔票、均有其充實之凖備金、且必經政府調查、認爲適合、其詳細數目、各銀行每星期均有詳細報告、可公開任人調查、本星期存數約爲三一九、九九○·○○○元、至全國銀幣之統計、則無從查考蓋銀幣種類繁多、現在流通市面者、卽清幣俗通龍洋、袁幣孫中山開國紀念幣、壘幣俗稱　洋、西班牙幣、俗稱站人洋、以及造幣廠新鑄之中山像銀幣等、種類旣多、而流行各地、更散漫難稽、故其詳細數目、實無從統計或估計也、外傳共三十萬萬、亦不足憑信也、</p>
<h3>十四團體籌備歡宴顔惠慶</h3>
<p>駐俄大使顔惠慶、此次因料理私事返國、刻已由津赴京、不日來滬、茲聞上海市商會以顔氏折衝樽俎、爲國事爭光、極堪欽仰、特發起歡宴、以示慰勞、茲經地方恊會·茶業公會·錢業公會·國際貿易恊會·蛋業公會·寗波旅滬同鄉會·國際問題研究會·銀行業公會·航業公會·寰球中國學生會·上海青年會·中國紅十字會·絲廠業公會·等十三團體贊同參加、刻已由市商會籌備一切、各團體如欲加入、須卽日與市商會接洽、每份隨收經費十元、</p>

<p>昨日我們提出了學習文學三個最基本的問題，先說明了··（一）什麽是我們所需要的文學？今日我們進而討論第二個課題。編者</p>
<p>（一）怎樣讀文藝作品？文藝書籍，大要的可以分成兩部份··一部份是關於理論的，另一部分是創作；如詩歌戲劇小說等。讀文藝理論書的方法，和讀一般社會科學書的方法，没有什麽不同、這方法，在前次我們已有過詳細的討論、現在我們要談的，專是關於讀文藝作品的方法。</p>
<p>文藝，在一般人看來，以爲本質上就和社會科學不同，其實，這是不大正確的，這錯誤是由於把文藝當成娛樂品而引起的。在本質上，文藝和社會科學同樣是表現社會的眞實，不過社會科學是理論的解剖，而文藝却是生活的描繪，文藝之和社會科學不同，只在於兩者表現的力法而已。社會科學是直接對讀者的理智的啓發；文藝作品則須通過讀者的感情才達到理智。讀社會科學，需要冷靜的頭腦；讀文藝藝作品，却須上具有豐富的感情，這一點。在談到怎樣讀文藝書以前，首先應該要明白的。</p>
<p>那末，我們到底要怎樣讀文藝書呢？我們可以分成三個步驟來說。第一，一般的讀法；第二，比較的讀法；第三，批評的讀法。</p>
<p>先講一般的讀法。通常最普遍的讀書法，我們知道是一句一句的熟讀，這是不錯的，讀没有内容的古文，如果不熟讀，則你唯一所想學取的辭藻和「抑，揚，頓，挫」的筆調，便無從學起；讀科學，如果不熟讀，則你所想記住的科學原理便無從記起。但是，這方法，倘應用到讀文藝作品，那就未免太笨。前面曾說過。我們讀文藝作品，並不是學點寫文章的技術，而是要獲得生活的資料、那就是說，應該注意作品的内容，譬如讀一篇小說，讀時，我們要注意的，是故事的如何展開，在這故事中，主人翁的如何活動，以及這故事表現的中心問題是什麽，簡單說，只要吸取那故事的本質，其他枝枝節節的描寫，卽使你隨看隨忘也不要緊。我們讀後，倘對於以上幾點已有簡明的印象，那我們讀的初步工作就算完成了。所以，讀文藝作品，不在熟讀，而在多讀。愈多讀，則生活的資料愈豐富。</p>
<p>其次，便是比較的讀法。對於一篇作品，僅僅是吸收其内容，自然還是不够。因爲作品的内容，是多式多樣的，有的可以資養我們的生活，有的可以腐蝕我們的生活。因之我們便應該把所讀的東西，加以過濾。這過濾，便是拿活生生的社會現象來和作品所描寫的相比較。我們讀文藝作品，不僅當作文藝作品讀，而要當作社會科學讀，當作生活記錄讀。我們不要受作品的欺騙，我們應該留心作品所描寫的究與現實相差多遠。舉例來說，有一部美國布克夫人著的大地，這小說，話多人都認爲是描寫中國農村的最好的作品。作者很精細地描寫出中國農付的衰弱和農民的飢荒，而把造成這現象的原因，歸之於天災和命運。但我們再從實際觀察一下，中國農付的衰敗，天災是不是成爲主要原因呢？顯然不是的。破壞中國農村的主力，是軍閥戰爭和帝國主義的經濟侵略。這樣，我們便可知道這部大地，多少是歪曲了現實的，而對這作品有了進一步的理解。　　再後我們便可談到批評的讀法了。所謂批評的讀法，也並不是對於一篇作品，每字每句都下一番推敲，而是從整個故事的開展上和依據自己的感受力來批評作品的各部份。當我們讀一篇作品時，我們怎樣來分别作者的描寫乎法好不好呢？描寫是在把内容更生動的烘托出來，是要使内容更易於感染讀者，從這見地，於是我們知道細緻的描寫，只限於能使讀者得到更明快的印象，和增强整個内容表現的力量，否則便等於多餘。當然，最主要的决定，還是在於作品的内容，文藝的形式是由内容誘致出來的。如上面所舉的大地，無論它的描寫是如何細膩，但由於它的内容是歪曲現實的，每當故事發展到較高階段，便故意使之轉　或下落，那描寫也就是一種浮彫，一種粉飾而失去其力量。</p>
<p>此外，還要再談到一點，就是許多讀者對於讀迻譯的作品感到困難，這困難固然一方面因爲譯品中所描寫的與我們的實生活很生疎，而另一方面，則由於有許多人名和地名不容易記的緣故。我們如要克服這困難，除用注入的方法多讀外，關於前者，只有我們選讀作品時注意選那與我們生活多少有關聯的作品，而對後者，因爲我們只須吸收作品的本質，人名地名之能否記住，實與我們讀書無多大關係</p>

<h3>演習</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>孔老大吃牛肉的前一天晚上，各種關於祭禮的「舞」「樂」，照例有一次演習。據說，凡屬文廟所在地的敎育當局，和文名藉甚之單，都得齋戒沐浴，參加演習。</p>
<p>的確，此調久已不彈，苟非演習，難免笑話。但笑話仍是有的，因爲對於這種演習，一般「文士」大都是憻懼有餘興感不足，所以演習的結果是不會十分純熟的。</p>
<p>這是以前的話。現在，所謂「舞」「樂」，大概是興感有餘憻懼不足的了！所以結果定可純熟。然而一般學生—或許也就是文士—仍能精益求精地在宿舍中並不光滑的地板上抱着位同性「迭律篤」「篤落迭」在反復「婆娑」，據說這也是演習。在孔老大眼中看來，「後生」是的確「可畏」的了！</p>
<p>中國人生成懶性，輕易不肯妄動，爲了王者之師吃頓年牛肉，不得不打起精神，漏夜演習，誠屬難得，此外，對於洋大人據說也有人用過演習功夫的，這大概是孔老大乘桴浮海的時期，所遺給他們的權威　官塲現形記中所述，山東某撫台爲了欵待洋大人的緣故，舉凡握乎，「也司」，和其他一切禮節，累得他澈夜未曾合眼，以致「昏頭搭腦」，仍不免閙出許多笑話！</p>
<p>這僅就「文事」一方面的演習而說。「有文事者必有武備」，現在不妨談談武備上的演習。</p>
<p>大約是二次江浙戰爭吧，孫傳芳旣標明「人不犯我我不犯人」的口號於前，似難食言而肥，甘作戎首。可是詭詐本來就是兵家常事。他託言演習，觀兵筧橋。這次演習，沿滬杭綫而至「滬寗綫」，概用「實彈射擊」，「殺聲震天」，「精神百倍」。「蘇督」楊宇霆就在孫軍演習將近南京時纔「出送」的。大概孫軍陣容，遠不及日本秋操的規模，宜其不值一看了。</p>
<p>這仍是以前的話。現在，演習的呼聲，洋溢全球，若陸軍，若海軍，若空軍，没有一國願意失去他們演習的機會。這僅指各國在他們自己的領土，領海，領空内演習而言。然而美國海軍在太平洋中的演習，竟使日本全國惶懼，嚴爲戒備。但日本軍隊在中國領土到處演習，</p>
<p>他們自己固然不會覺得這是不當，而我們中國竟也視若無暏！這種宏大氣度的「演習」，眞所謂「由來久矣」！不過現在中國人似乎也「小心眼兒」得多，知道提出「抗議」！比之前清官員給洋大人三拳打不出一個悶屁，眞是够痛快的了！</p>
<h3>鏡</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>鏡是人們的伴侣，尤其是女人，一刻兒不離身畔。鏡又呌做「鑑」，古時候是銅做的，近代始用玻璃。漢書道：「以鏡考已行」；「陳女圖以鏡監兮」，「究其終始彊弱之變，明鑑戒焉」。司馬光有「資治通鑑」，張居正有「帝鑑圖說」，可知鏡的功用，　不獨在於照容，而且在於燭心了。</p>
<p>人們對於鏡的觀念，愛，憎各有不同。如花似玉的美人兒，當然時對菱花，我見猶憐。不單是鏡裏眞眞，别人瞧了可愛，呼之欲出；便是美人自身，也是照了又照，抹脂匀粉，畫眉點唇，都把鏡當做美顔良伴咧。</p>
<p>從前有位女子做詩道：「乍見不知誰覿面，細看眞覺我憐卿」。宋人也有幾句詠鏡詩，甚麽「貧女如花祇鏡知」；「鏡裏自應諳素貌，人間只解看紅妝」：「自家憐未了，臨去復裵　」。瞧這幾句詩，女子對於鏡，不是知己嗎？但，我曾見一個女子詩道：「自顧年來憔悴影，怕臨青鏡怕人看」—紅顔顦顇，感嘅係之，鏡何嘗負責任啊！古人也有幾句詩道：「老不甘心奈鏡何」！「朱顔誰不惜，白髮爾先知」。「縱使逢人見，猶勝自見悲」！年光那肯倒流，昔日朱顔今白頭，也何須怨鏡呢。</p>
<p>劉姥姥誤入怡紅院，見對面迎上來一個老太婆，仔細一看，原來就是自己。劉姥姥没見過大鏡兒，幾乎閙成笑話，這也不足爲奇。可是怡紅院裏這面大鏡兒，天天照着如花似玉的鶯鶯燕燕；忽然照了一位鷄皮鶴髮的鄉下老婆子，劉姥姥之幸呢？還是這面鏡兒的不幸呢？</p>
<p>鏡隨物現形，本没有美，醜，長，短，方，圓的成見。人心和一面鏡兒一般，没有塵埃堆積，天天勤懇拂拭，當然瑩潔光明，没有絲毫渣涬了。惜夫世人嗜慾重重，性爲了物慾所蔽，不是很像鏡兒蒙了一層厚厚的灰塵嗎？這時候，把這面鏡兒去照物，那能照得出美，醜，善，惡，大，　小，方，圓呢！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十五回</p>
<p>淚臉送人辭家歸遠戍</p>
<p>風沙澈夜出塞駐孤城</p>
<p>兩名弟兄也急了，抓着兩個鄉下人就頓了脚呌他别跑。鄉下人以爲這可没命了，向地下蹲着，殺猪般的呌着。那些要沈逃命的鄉下人，看到這種樣子，越發是跑得厲害。那個剛才相遇到的新郎，身上背着一個小脚婦人，兩手托了他的膝蓋，也由面前飛跑過去。自强旣好氣，又好笑，向兩個兵道：算了罷，放他走罷，他們也太可憐。那兩個蹲在地上的百姓，同磕着頭，掙脫了兩個兵的手，一溜烟的跑了。自强道：這事太糟，我們對營長去說罷。於是四人走出堡來，全部隊伍，已經也到堡門口了。自强把這裏情形，向營長告訴了一番。寳芳皺了眉笑道：鄉下人蠢得可憐，這也没有法子。我們原來只要他們借些屋子我們住的，旣然都跑走了，那只好把各家的東西給封存起來，我們住一半，留一半等老百姓回來。這回師長訓話，再三呌我們做臉，我們總得把軍紀風紀，格外弄好。大家吃了一宿的苦，說不得了，我們暫時進堡去休息。說着話時，全營人已進了堡門。忙亂了半日，騰好了二十户人家。駐下兵士。趙自强挨着次序住下來，恰好是住在這重貼喜字的土屋裏。這屋裏有些簡陋東西，在未讓軍隊搬入之前，已經移到不駐軍隊的民房裏存着了，現在這裏，就只有一張土坑，四堵黃土壁子，壁上有紅紙貼的兩三副喜聯，却不能移去。自强一進了這屋子，就覺得心裏微微震動幾下，對了這堵壁子，也就看呆了。（三三八）</p>
<h3>硯的研究（四）</h3>
<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>一代的文化，恒以國家的治亂爲轉移，而一切技術工藝，亦即隨以進退。元代禍亂相尋，根本没有甚麽文化可言，當時愛硯的晝畫家，僅有趙松雪倪雲林等三數人，而流傳的名硯，見於廣倉硯錄者，亦只有武宗皇后一硯著名，那可不必深加討論。到明代，文化又稍發達，而特别重視者，則爲創設畫院，其時文人學士，如入畫院，卽可聲價頓增，宣德年間之畫院，尤爲著稱，謝環商喜戴進周文清之徒，皆出其中；江南的名畫家，如周東村，唐寅，仇英·沈石田·文徴明·董其昌·陳繼儒等，相繼而出，書畫與硯，關係更爲切要。故名書畫家，無不愛硯，苟得一名石，必徴求名工雕琢，名人題跋。至萬歷時開坑，適發現水岩，於是端硯之名始著。滿清繼明而起，因康熙乾隆，都以愛硯稱，極力羅致名硯，其見於譜者，有乾隆御府之西青硯譜二十四册，又有寳庫硯譜六十四圖，及其他各譜，計有六種之多。因其時承平無事，物力豐厚，上以文藝倡，士大夫和附，凡工詩能文之人，以及有名之藝術家，無不致力於硯之美術化，而又不惜人工財力，開掘端坑，水巖之精英，盡情發洩，硯之美，可謂極盛一時，無以復加矣。統計滿清一代</p>
<p>著名愛硯家，有朱彝尊·王士貞·陳恭尹·潘耒·施閏章·萬斯同·宋犖·高士奇·翁嵩年·林吉人·黃莘田·王澍·丁敬身·沈廷芳·馬日琯·馬日璐·袁枚·吳繩年·劉墉·翁方綱·梁同書·紀曉嵐·袁樹·錢大昕·計壽喬·計儋石·王文治·伊秉綬·桂未谷·陳鴻　·吳蘭修·吳榮光·張廷濟·張之洞等；</p>
<p>著名製硯家，有黃宗炎·潘子和·孔傳焯·高鳳翰·張純·王　君·潘鳳·張崇益·吳育·孫愼夫·劉虚白·朱旭·朱龍·顧二娘·金冬心·周蘭坡·楊龍石等；</p>
<p>關於硯之著述，其最著名者有，高固齋端石攷·余澹心硯林·潘稼堂端溪硯石賦銘·朱竹坨說硯硯銘·施愚山硯林拾遺·金冬心硯銘·唐衡銓名硯圖攷·袁香亭筆錄端溪硯譜記·林培雲陶舫硯史·紀曉嵐閱微草堂硯譜·高鳳翰硯史·黃點蒼端溪硯史匯參·朱二坨端硯小史·陳介亭端石擬·計壽喬端溪硯坑考·吳繩年端溪硯坑記·李兆洛端溪硯坑記·吳蘭修端溪硯史·何石卿寳硯堂硯辨·沈石友硯林等。其他如王漁陽曹秋岳高小琴楊景素等各有紀述甚多，不及縷舉。由此可見清代硯材與文藝，兩臻極盛而硯之變化，亦由此而止了。</p>

<h3>交流收音機電源的分析</h3>
<p>— 孟澂</p>
<p>用眞空管的收音機、最難解决的是電源、直流電要甲，乙，丙三組電池，就中以甲組電池和乙組電池，最成問題，丙組電池因電壓較低，電流極微，故較易解决。用交流電時，三組電池所分任的工作、將統歸二根電燈綫擔任了，一切電源，都取給於電燈綫。</p>
<p>交流收音機的電源，可分作四部份來說明··</p>
<p>（一）電源變壓器　普通恒爲二個或二個以上的變壓器組成、一個將電燈綫上二百二十或一百一十伏脫的交流電壓，降低至適量的燈絲電壓，直接接至眞空管上的燈絲或熱絲，以代直流收音機裏甲組電池之用。另一個變壓器將電燈綫來的電壓，升高或降低至最大需要的屏極電壓，但是從變壓器出來的都是交流電壓，而收音機裏乙丙組電池、必須直流電壓，所以還要另接機件，使這個交流電壓變成直流電壓。</p>
<p>（二）整流器　整流器有單流性，就是電流在整流器裏、祇有在一個方向可以流通，在相反的方向不能流通，所以整流器的作用，就是把正負時變的交流電壓，割去一半，變成單向的顫動電壓。整流器的種類很多、在收音機裏，以應用二極眞空管的居多、有所謂水銀整流管的，也是二極管的一種、不過在製造時候、置入水銀少許、以增加整流的效率罷了。在强力電動喇叭裏，也須應用直流低電壓，以增加牠的輸出電力、這個直流低電壓，現在都用新式氧化銅整流器，從交流電壓直接取用。</p>
<p>（三）濾波器　收音機裏需要的屏極與栅極電壓，都是定值的直流電壓，從整流器出來的顫動電壓，雖是直流，但電壓之，時時變化，先從零漸漸增至最大，再由最大漸减至零，因此，有將顫動電壓，修改而爲定值電壓的必要。濾波器的功用、就是把顫動電壓顫動的範圍，减至最小限度，經過濾波器出來的電壓，幾爲定值。濾波器爲幾個定量電容器與幾個鐵心綫圈合組成，電容器的電容量很大，有儲存電子的能力、當電壓爲極大時、將電流暫時儲存，但當電壓减低時，電流仍能流出，這樣，可以有餘補不足，减少電壓的顫動。鐵心綫圈之自感量很大，不論電壓增大或减小時候、牠都有反對電流發生變化的作用，換句話說，就是鐵心綫圈也有維持電壓爲定值的功效。（待續）</p>
<h3>ＡＢＣ代電器之構造及其原理</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>舊式收音機内使用的電源，大概都是乾電或是蓄電池所供給的。此類電源，携帶旣不便利，管理又極麻煩。新式收音機，祇要添上一只整流管和幾件小巧的零件外，所有一切的電源，便能源源不絶而來。最近無綫電收音機，在中國能够普及於一般的民衆，實在不能不歸功於ＡＢＣ代電器，（ＥＬＩＮＩＮＡＴＩＲ）的貢獻。</p>
<p>常用ＡＢＣ代電器的構造和原理，有如下述··、</p>
<p>Ａ電部份</p>
<p>因爲Ｓ電的用途，祇在燃熱燈絲，發射電子，所以不論交直流電源，都可使用交流收音機内常用的Ａ電，都是利用變壓器將外來電壓（１１０或２２０Ｖ）降低後再用的。如圖，Ｓ１爲２。５Ｖ次級綫圈，供燃燒檢波及放大管燈絲用。Ｓ３爲Ｖ５。之次級線圈，專供整流管燈絲用。Ｒ爲廿歐姆之中分電阻，（供用時必須直接··在燈座上，請參閱本刊第十一期。）牠的作用，是在得到燈絲電位數值一定不變的一點，屏栅兩極的回路，（卽Ｂ與Ｃ—）接在此點後，能减少交流音，如果欲减少交流音至最低限度，那麽除掉末級强力輸出管外，其餘的最好一概都採用傍熱式眞空管。（ＬＮＤＩＲＥＣＴＨＥＡＴＥＲＴＵＢＥ）</p>
<p>Ｂ電部份</p>
<p>Ｂ電是加在眞空管的屏極和簾栅極，以吸收燈絲上發來的電子用的。因爲電子是負性，所以屏極和簾栅極必須要接上正電壓，纔有作用。又因爲屏壓一有變動，容易引起雜聲，所以Ｂ電必須要用穩定不變的直流電纔行。</p>
<p>Ｂ代電器的構造，雖各有不同，但是牠的原理，總不外乎下述四端··</p>
<p>（一）新式收音機的屏壓有高至二百五十弗打以上的，因此，外來一百十或二百二十弗打的電壓，便覺太低。所以第一步必須將外來電壓升高至需要的數值後，始能應用。變壓器Ｔ及其次級線圈Ｓ２，便是負着這項使命的。（見圖Ａ及Ｂ）</p>
<p>（二）整流管Ｖ１利用同性相斥異性相吸的原理，將升高之Ｂ　電壓，變成單向的顫動電流。（如圖Ｃ）此種顫動式的直流電，一時還不能直接加在各眞空管的屏極上，否則揚聲器内便要發聲極大的營營聲、擾亂正音。</p>
<p>（三）濾波器的作用，是在將整流後的顫動電流，變成平滑的直流電。我們知道，塞流圈因爲本身有極大的磁感得，（常用的爲三十亨利，如有電動楊聲器，可利用牠的磁塲綫圈作爲塞流圈。）</p>
<p>所以牠對於顫動電流的通過、是很困難的。但是電容器的作用，却正和牠相反。起伏不定的顫動電流，一時旣無路可走，便祇能在電容器内稍事休息後，再緩緩地通過塞流圈。結果，在Ｄ處便能得到穩定直流電。</p>
<p>（四）如果收音機内祇要一種Ｂ電壓，那麽Ｂ代電器的工作，至此便可結束。但是事實上收音機必須各種不同的Ｂ電壓，纔能以供給檢波，振盪及放大管的用途。所以必須再經過一番分壓的手續後，纔能完成。</p>
<p>各種高低不同的Ｂ電壓，都是利用串聯在屏路内的電阻而降低的。如圖，假如放大管Ｖ５需要屏壓１８０Ｖ，依歐姆定律，得ＲＩ＝　　　　　　歐姆。又如檢波管Ｖ２需要４５Ｖ的屏壓得</p>
<p>歐姆</p>
<p>Ｃ電部份</p>
<p>Ｃ電是接在放大管的栅極上以免放大時發生失眞用的。需要的是數值不變的負電壓。通常也是利用一段電阻接在燈絲中分電阻（或陰極）與Ｂ—間而完成的如圖Ｖ４爲４７號五極放大管，當屏壓爲２５０Ｖ時，需要的Ｃ電爲—６。５Ｖ依歐姆定律、得Ｒ＝　　　　　　　　　　４５０歐姆。同樣，得Ｒ３＝　　　　　＝２７００歐姆。與Ｒ３及Ｒ４並聯者·爲ＩＭＦ之固定電窜器，作用在使低週率電流容易通過，改善眞空管放大的音質。</p>
<h3>整流管種種</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>交流機盛行以來，整流管遂代替乙丙電池的工作，供給屏壓與栅壓。整流管本是二極管，應用「愛迪生效用」，以交流電變成半波或全波直流電，接以電　阻，調節適當的電壓，施用於收音機上，較之用電池，手續旣便，經濟又省，所以整流管能與收音機上他種眞空管，隨着時代需要而改良與進化、今將其各式的特性與效用，略以述之。</p>
<p>８０全波整流管，昔爲最適用之整流管，以供給四燈以上及七燈以下電源，甚爲適合，亦可作半波整流用，用時將兩屏極並接，則輸出電流較作全波整流時稍可增此管特性··絲壓爲５弗打，絲極電流爲２安培，屏壓爲３５０－５５０弗打，屏流爲１２５—１３５千分安培，</p>
<p>８１半波整流管，絲壓爲７。５弗打，絲極電流爲１。２５安培，屏壓爲７００弗打，屏流爲８５千分安培，此整流管因輸出電壓旣高，故其濾波器設置稍貴，在普通收音機中罕用之，此管若用二只，卽可作全波整流之用，（接綫圖因篇幅關係，從簡，）</p>
<p>８２全波水銀蒸氣整整管（ＦＵＬＬＷＡＶＥＭＥＲＣＵＲＹＶＡＰＯＲＲＥＣＴＩＦＩＥＲ）爲進步的微量水銀，在使用時，水銀被蒸發，管内充滿了水銀原子，負着正電荷的離子，就與絲極和屏極間排斥出來的陰電子相中和，以增加電子的總數，而使整流效用加强，此種整流管管内降壓僅爲十五弗打，使用這管，兩屏極須串接高週率扼制圈各一，管用鎳罩隔絶之，可免收音上因整流變動，發生雜亂之交流聲，又能增加其靈敏度，此管因内阻甚低，用時尤須注意，不可使其負荷超過百分之五十，否則燈絲卽易損壞，此管待性，絲壓爲２。５弗打，絲極電流爲３安培壓爲５００弗打，屏流爲１２５千分安培，在，屏新式收音機上，此管常用之。</p>
<p>８３。５２３。全波水銀蒸氣整流管，其待性與效用幾與８２管仿若、惟絲壓爲５弗打、屏流爲５００千分安培，較倍於８２管，在今七燈收音機以上，當取８０８１管而代之。</p>
<p>８４傍熱式全波整流管，此管專用在汽車收音機上，證絲電源用直流或交流都可供給之，其特性，絲壓爲６。３弗打，絲極電流爲。５安培，屏壓爲２２５弗打，屏流爲５０千分安培。</p>
<p>２５２５傍熱式倍壓整流管，此管專用於交直流兩用收音機或不需變壓器收音機上，接綫的方法有二種，若是收音機交直流兩用的，則可接爲半波式；若僅用於交流，則可接至倍壓器，換言之，卽把交流電壓變成兩倍的直流電壓，其能作倍壓器原理與接法，容暇再述之，此管特性清參看拙著「２５Ｚ５新式眞空管介紹」一文，載本刊二十三期，此管應用甚廣，在今交直流兩用機上皆用作整流。</p>
<p>１２Ｚ３傍熱式半波整流管，絲壓爲１２。６弗打，絲極電流爲３安培之屏壓爲２３０弗打，屏流爲６０千分安培，此管亦常用於交直流兩用機上。</p>

<p>— 古明</p>
<p>早不久因「京海」問題討論的最多的時候，便略論及好文學作品之闕如，因而想起物質環境日趨下劣，艱窘，要什麽人才也没有，不但文學的··而南方因爲自然環境的關係，還略有幾個執筆的人云云。同時某君便力加反對，以爲文學和自然毫無關係，俄國物質環境極艱窘，還有普希金云云。那理論也很有價值，因爲在我們的現狀下因此更應出普希金，可以爲現代諸文學家的他山之石，更加自勉，是對的。　但一切天才，仙才，人才，鬼才，無論文學的，哲學的，自然科學的，社會科學的，必在這人類中可知··旣是在這社會中，必受物質環境的支配亦可知，幾曾見没有受敎育的黃包車夫作詩、或不識英國文的人，大讀莎士比亞的原著呢？無法可想，這是事實。普希金是先懂俄文才能作詩；他的頭上也有着憂鬱底暗夜，也有遼闊底天空，印在他的詩以内。—實在并不是希奇的道理。</p>
<p>東勝神洲近來越弄越「地瘠民貧」了，也是事實，「物産豐富」，「土地肥沃」，早已成爲欺人欺己之談··在瓦礫中要開出牡丹花，在草叢中想摘到很大的蘋婆，除了婆羅門的幻術外，也是不可能之事實。某君希望此中出普希金，是好意的，但倘有普希金那樣的天才，無論百個千個，也許早因環境惡劣，化爲異物了。</p>
<p>天才缺乏，作品少有，精神物質皆成了整個的貧窮。幾個小卒小𡝵在文壇上亂捧亂喝，大分其「京」「海」，無以名之，名之曰「野狐禪」。野狐而大談禪理，其理之荒唐可知。倘若志在一小鷄或野兎，而申明「我是吃齋的」或「我是坦白的」其糟更可知！許多人想在文壇上發財發福，長生不老，與此無異。北地狐多而禪狐少，南方狐少而禪狐多，只看那班人在大談文學的分類或詩的作法，聽者皆係青年，也可彷彿狐禪之一二。—</p>
<h3>孔廟散步（續）</h3>
<p>— 白戈</p>
<p>大成殿已經很古老了，一切都顯出憔悴和顫抖的樣子，只有那前面的十根龍柱特别雄壯動人。據說這龍柱在全中國要數第一第二，在中國底石刻歷史上是很有地位的，我不懂藝術，只是見了它就想盤旋到那上面去大呌三聲。現代的拜金藝術已經將我們窒悶得連氣都不能出了！前面是一片由磚瓦舖成的壩子。那磚瓦，只要用東西一啄，被啄的地方就會浸濕，據說是漢朝的，故呌做漢磚。但有一點令人可笑，就是那引路的人一定要津津樂道地向你解釋，說那磚瓦會流汗，所以呌做汗磚。這只有待地質學家們去考究了，不干我們底事。殿内，正中自然坐的是孔子，兩旁照例是四配十哲。孔子手中執的那個笏，實在不稱，據說原是緣玉作的，後來才被孔府換成現在這個樣子，怕的是被人盜刦。折出來向左走去，有幾根石欄杆又可供給我們一點傳說··以前乾隆到了這里，用手拍着這些欄杆，鏘然有聲，到了第三根的時候，乾隆說了一句笑話，「你敢再響」，於是以下的便不響了。這雖然是一個可笑的傳說，但知道了這個傳說再去拍那幾根欄杆的確要有興味些。我每次往那里過都要去拍幾下。</p>
<p>後面接連的是寢殿，輝煌奪目，一切階壁瓦石都是嶄新的，大不像大成殿那没落的光景</p>
<h3>蕭山的湘湖</h3>
<p>— 湯崑</p>
<p>一跨過錢塘江，第一個縣份就是蕭山；在這縣的西門，有着一個湘湖。他雖然没有像西子湖一樣名滿中外，但有些地方是比西湖更要可愛的。</p>
<p>湘湖不像西湖的「艷妝濃抹」，她是具有着素樸的古風。我們可以說西湖是一個嬌嬈的貴婦，而湘湖却是一個優婉的村姑。在西湖，一眼望去，都是紅紅綠綠的彩色，使人感着俗氣太重；至於湘湖呢？一眼望去，在春夏時是無邊際的水，動着鱗鱗的微波，岸上是蔥鬱的樹葉，濃密的影子，倒映在湖中，仿彿在不斷地跟着那一圈圈的水紋散開去，而其實是靜止着，青綠的葉子裏，間或露出一些竹籬茅舍，有時傳來一聲悠長的鷄嗚或犬吠。忽而一個汲水的婦女跑來湖邊汲水，平靜的湖面便被打破了烟波深處有時也許有一隻古樸的小舟，孤零零的在浮蕩着。在秋冬季裏，這湖上更換了一件明淡的衣服。湖岸上都是疏疏的樹枝不剩下一辦枯葉。吹菱芡的女孩。蕩着小舟，在湖中信口唱曲。住在這湖邊的人，大多是燒窰吃飯的，每當夕陽西下，一縷縷的窰烟在空中搖曳；和這湖中的野鳥上下飛翔，成了湖中最好的風景。湖的左岸是高高低低的山峯，白雲起伏，引人遐想。湖的中間，幾個小洲凸出水面；上面生有雜樹，棲息着一二水島。定山、一覽亭，壓湖山等都是湖中風景清幽處所，定山上築有浙江省立湘湖鄉村師範校舍夾在萬道修竹之中，更見雄偉，幽靜，允爲湘湖最勝之處。年來慕湘湖之名，遠道來遊的人，一天多過一天，在不久的將來，湘湖也許會與西湖一樣聞名呢。</p>
<h3>老地保</h3>
<p>— 焕明</p>
<p>那個白鬢·抖唇的老地保，是我到家後第一個見到的來客。他非常謙恭的走進門，在堂前的桌上、開了他的墨盒。提起筆，在一張灰白色的紙上抖抖筆··</p>
<p>「盛—盛　　吧，幾歲？」</p>
<p>「好啦，好啦，阿發，一天到晚看見你來調查户口，」母親說：「一天到晚調查户口，眞見鬼，我還没看見縣裏有過入口統計的報告，你自己張三李四，七十八十歲寫些上去算了。」「哦，哦，是的，是的，太太，」他在那張「清查户口牌照」上塗了一個名字：「我給你貼到大門上去，我··」</p>
<p>貼好後，他拿了一角錢的手續費走了還没住滿半個月，老地保又來了。他哼着，雙瞳無光，右手撑了一根門閂，臉色很難看—病了。帶的東西還是前回的那些，墨盒，筆，一捲清查户口的牌照紙。他很不安的啓了墨盒，抖抖手：　「盛—盛　　吧，幾歲？」</p>
<p>「又要清查户口嗎？這—眞認眞，太認眞了吧？」</p>
<p>「這是「上面」的命令··「上面」命令我們這樣清查··」</p>
<p>「有公文嗎，—這個手續費太不近情理了！」</p>
<p>他不安地，勉强的掛着笑，呐呐地；「没帶來—忘記帶了···」</p>
<p>「我在外面多年，没有碰到過這種認」</p>
<p>眞的調查—外國都没有，也不要手續費···」我猛然道··「這是你們地保的「外快」吧！」</p>
<p>他的眼瞳發出憐憫的光··「—不呌地保，我是村警，不錯，不錯，村警就是地保···哈哈哈·」</p>
<p>「是不是「外快？」」我緊追着問。</p>
<p>他窘着，咳嗆了一陣。抖動嘴唇··「不瞞你說，村警是没有薪水的，是不是？哈哈哈—數目有限，你們，有錢人，</p>
<p>不在乎，哈哈哈!」</p>
<p>接了錢，他拿起墨盒想走了。頓住脚，說··「謝謝你，我們「没」的人眞没辦法，老了，一個「老光棍，」病了只好請你們帮帮忙，無倚無靠的—不瞞您說，村警是没有薪水的。」</p>
<p>除夕前一日，我勢必離家了。跟着行李走出門，又發見老地保撑着門閂在走上我家門檻。帶的東西還是前回的那些，墨盒，筆，那捲灰白色的紙，大概還是清查户口的牌照紙吧？</p>
<h3>關於「罪惡的黑手」</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>「文學」新年號上發表了　克家的「罪惡的黑手」。那是一首較長的詩。同「烙印」裏邊的詩</p>
<p>作比較起來。那是一個狠大的進步。</p>
<p>從這詩看來，臧克家好像在漸漸地要解脫自己的「小我」，而努力於由個人的描寫轉向到社會的描寫。從大的社會中去找他的詩作的題材。</p>
<p>在「罪惡的黑手」裏，臧克家描寫了都市中的禮拜堂的建築中所含有的一個盾矛。他的目的是在於暴露敎會的罪惡。他注意到了那兩個方面；夾作禮拜的敎徒的情形和修築敎堂的苦工的情形。在一個塲所，在一個上帝的統治之下，竟有兩個不同的世界。同是「上帝的兒子」，爲什麽有的人是這樣，有的人是那樣呢？於是，在最後，他想像出奴隸的叛逆，而預言到「那時這敎堂會變成他們的食堂或是臥室」了。這裏表露着自由主義者的要求，表露着反宗敎的情緒。他能暴露出列强侵略中國使用宗敎這個武吕以麻醉中國民衆之點（）這底確是值得我們注意的。</p>
<p>宗敎這種東西，眞不知造了多少罪惡。想起歐洲中世敎會的情形，只有給牠的罪惡加上一個「不可言喻」的字樣。數百年來的進步的人羣的工作，終未能把牠從歐洲社會中驅逐出去，而到了爭奪殖民地的時節，侵略者却藉着宗敎來給賤民們打麻醉針了。在中國這塊土上。牠是作了怎樣數不盡的罪惡呀！想一想「團匪之亂」以前的情形罷，那會令毛骨悚然的。「五四」以來，反宗敎運動興隆了幾年，可是，現在這一個運動都「不景氣」了似的。好像人人都從大處着眼，而很少人肯從小處入手似的。臧克家能捉住這一個宗敎侵略的題材，縱令是表現得不够，也是值得推荐的。</p>
<p>這種比較大的題材使他採用了長詩的形式。它更使他相當地抛棄了自己的狹窄的哲學。這是比「烙印」中的詩進步的地方。以後，如果他更進一步地去認識社會的話。自然不會錯誤的。而且這種以平凡的實生活中求偉大的材料的辦法，我以爲也是别的詩人們所要學習的。（未完）</p>
<h3>詩經試譯</h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>有狐</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>有一隻孤單單的狐，在那座淇水的石橋。不免心裏替他憂了，那人兒没有褲一條！</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>有一隻孤單單的狐，在那條淇水渡口。不免心裏替他憂了，那人兒腰帶也没有！</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>有一隻孤單單的狐，在那條淇水的旁邊。不免心裏替他憂了，那人兒没有衣服穿！</p>
<h3>暮（七）</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>月光裏的景物是靜穆的，她們安嫻地坐那裏，呼吸关鮮潔的空氣。突然間，有把鐵門拉開了的聲音，汽車的喇叭在呌破了這靜默，狗也在嘈雜地吠着。這都像毒質一樣的使她們的　腦子感到苦痛，青枝立刻站起來關了窗。</p>
<p>「大約又是宴客吧。」</p>
<p>「誰知道，總是這種煩人的事！」</p>
<p>她們只說過了這兩句話，就又陷入沉默之中，只有壁鐘的擺在平匀地響着。</p>
<p>門突然被推開了，女僕的聲音在說着··</p>
<p>「小姐們在房麽？怎麽黑黝黝的坐着呢？您知道麽，三小姐回來。」</p>
<p>「是從南京麽？也没有來過信呀。」</p>
<p>「就說呢，還把兩個孩子也都帶了來。」</p>
<p>「呵，——那我們到樓下去看她吧」。青松朝了青枝說。</p>
<p>「不用，三小姐說過回頭就來看您的」。</p>
<p>「那你先開了燈吧」。</p>
<p>燈明了，她們站起來，拉拉縐了的衣服，吩咐女僕泡點清茶來。</p>
<p>一陣雜亂的細碎的脚步聲音之後，青柏領了六歲的玲玲和四歲的鹿兒進來了。</p>
<p>「姊姊們好呵。站好了給姨姨鞠躬」。青柏向着他們行禮之後，在吩咐着兩個孩子。乖巧的孩子，也並没有羞却的毛病、就大大方方地如她的意做去。</p>
<p>她們早已站起來，露了久遠不見的笑容來歡迎着，高興地走過來握着孩子們的乎。</p>
<p>「你好呵，你，什麽時候到的？」</p>
<p>「纔下車就來了，」青柏還是那樣活潑，鬆開了一邻握着孩子的手，掠着頭髮，「姊姊們請坐吧。」</p>
<p>「那我們都坐下吧。」</p>
<p>青柏是穿了紫色的衣服，剪裁得很入時的，她雖然生産過兩個孩子，仍然有很窈窕的身材，她的臉搽着胭脂和粉，說是已經有二十八歲，可是看起來不過是二十三四歲似的。</p>
<p>「這一次，怎麽想到回來呢？」</p>
<p>「要是依他的意，大約這一生也不要我回來的」，青柏露了一點高興的感歎，「可巧他爲公事要到雲南去，自然我不能隨了他，我就趁這機會回來了。」</p>
<p>「一轉眼，我們有五年没有見面了！」</p>

<h3>紐約銀鑛股跌風甚猛</h3>
<p>新豐洋行十五日報告云、紐約股市因財長毛根梭反對目前對白銀有所舉動、銀鑛等股乃起猛烈跌風、銀價曾一度曾瀉落二分、慘落之巨、造成本年之新紀錄、合衆國冶金（銀股領袖）暴跌九元、各股遂被牽動、一致低落、末後因政府提議准許古巴運入之酒不加限制、及市塲因多空籌碼關係、略起回風、小交易所中鑛股脫乎、電廠股了結、市况亦疲債券參差、富投機性之債券因連漲數日、多頭出籠異常踴躍、全日成交一百三十四萬股、（小麥）多頭稍有脫手、現貨需要甚佳、産麥區氣候太早、（棉花）財部反對白銀立法、膨脹派非常懊喪、朋克海案明日可在衆院通過、然後再送參院、國外美棉消耗有增加可能、故將影響遠期行市、期貨市塲清平、茲將道瓊斯指數列後、</p>

<h3>紗花標紗多空勢均力敵</h3>
<p>紗市晨跌午漲、形勢依然挺拔、因雙方成交數太多、廠方决定六月一日起、對於工作實行減縮、故某廠吸進大量之額、决意收貨、但一般散户鹽於實銷呆滯、抛空之念未絶、於是多空兩方的爭鬥力異常濃厚、</p>
<h3>標紗晨降午回</h3>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以上日英廠有開出棉紗之虚風賣户活動、各有跌五·六·七，八角至一元、午後塲面驟枯、多　　　收不放、市氣愈緊、各月漲三、四·五·六·七角至一元二角、全日成交統計三萬三千九百包、查賣出大豐一千五百五十包、森康一千四百包、元德一千二百包、長豐一千七百包、大昶六百五十包、大孚七百包、買進振大一千零五十包、大昶七百包、椿記七百包、錦　六百五十包泰昌八百包、仁豐五百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>標花後市大俏</h3>
<p>棉市晨平、午後大漲、美棉市價未動、但匯兌趨縮、以至採算價增漲、同時業棉有看好消息、於是買風稍起、市盤隨之而漲、現棉廠銷漸見活動、因此人心觀高一點、不過有一部份投機商乘漲抛出、</p>
<h3>鄭標好四角</h3>
<p>標花前市開盤、以美棉平平、匯兌雖縮、人心軟化、各月平平、午後有一部份空頭抵補、各月漲三·四角、全日成交統計六萬六千四百担、查賣出振大二千七百担、長豐三千八百担、大孚五千担源大四千六百担、遠大一千一千九百担、同興一千三百担、問和二千二百担、買進吉豐二千五百担、源大一千四百担、愼昌記四千五百担、賡豐六千四百担、仁豐一千一百担、永昌一千六百担、信誠二千二百担、椿記四千五百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>美棉盤旋無變化</h3>
<p>昨日美棉市况、缺乏重要賣户、華爾街疲軟而疲、後以空頭抵補回漲、結果現貨不動、期貨漲一磅音至四磅音、利物浦棉現貨漲一點、期貨跌二點至四點、埃及棉現貨不動、孟買棉市、因投機家買進而堅、收盤堅穩、結果平加兩跌一羅比、奥姆辣跌二角半，白羅溪漲七角半、原電錄左、（十五日電）</p>

<h3>糧食粉麥實銷清淡之至</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼穩之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥小四五角左右、坎拿大小一角零、開價後人心大致平平、且以實銷依然清淡、購買力薄弱、實爲開市來所僅見、不過廠方擯持、浮空迫不及待、略有抵進、市氣轉好、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易清寂、惟以市塲浮多、微有抬價、人心轉佳、但實銷不動、終覺堅中帶懈也、結果本月份好七厘半、四月份好五厘，五月份好二厘半、六月份好一分、七八月份各好二厘</p>
<p>半云、</p>
<p>昨標凖小麥期甚少做開、早午兩市祇有三四六七八月拍開一盤、市面十分清淡、現麥亦無做開　　蘇同粳略提五分</p>
<p>—晚稻市忽見轉定—</p>
<p>（滬南）昨各帮來源三十餘號、（五千餘石）其中以晚稻居多、厚粳占少數、而晚稻去路雖南北洋兩帮續有採取、然爲數已不若前市之旺、計共納青角松洒西練晚稻二千餘包、市况未見榮辱、而各厚粳、以城鄉店胃驟見轉活、形勢自初市起郎頗栗落、結果究以久疲之後、尙難立呈緊秀、緣如常帮蘇同南港等粳行情祇得略提五分、杜洋尖供求猶屬和平、市色無甚上落、變元貨乏胃香、較爲挺秀、陰元來源稍夥、去路平常、現象似含軟色耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各貨到埠二十七八號、市上各色銷路續化、市形白粳早薄稻羊社埠尖陰元由元等均形挺立之格、</p>
<h3>絲茶華絲電報均無發出</h3>
<p>紐約現絲價已跌進四百五十元、横濱日絲亦祇四百七八十元、是以華絲市價亦隨而步跌、滬埠各廠商僉以Ｂ級白廠經每包成本須七八百元、虧本太鉅、絲電均無發出、現絲亦無成交、市氣績呈疲靜、</p>
<h3>祁門茶業依然活躍</h3>
<p>祁門浮梁建德等處紅茶、每年出産不下六七萬箱、去年製茶莊號、共有三百家左右、營業結果、大部份多受虧折、因而被迫停業者、不下二三十家、現下茶事將届發動、祁浮各路號家、對於對務上、均已積極進行、連日與上海各茶棧、接洽放欵、情勢依然活躍云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>封建殘餘下的婚姻制度</h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>近遇朋友鶴君談到林君近來臉上時時露着抑鬱不快之色，其原因說是因爲他的父母已與他預定了婚禮的日子了。記得在去年的秋天吧！我曾聞得林君由父母之主而已經「定親」了。但那時没有聞說他的不願。但這次聞他是反對他「父母之命」的，而且已經幾度的與他們解說與爭論了。</p>
<p>是的，林君年紀很青——纔滿二十歲——並且正在高中肆業而没有「自立」呢，若是這樣就要急急地談到婚姻（雖然這時不須他的負担），那末我們不論是主觀的或是客觀的來說終是未免太早了罷！但是林君他旣處在他父母的經濟控制之下，又聞這次他父母的意思是十分堅决的，因此雖然林君毅然地反抗着，結果怎樣，很難預料——林君又十分消極，喜劇乎，悲劇乎？「下回」頗難一分解」也！</p>
<p>本來，在一般「富家子弟一，雖然稚氣未脫，發育未全，並且身無一藝之長」</p>
<p>而就得「良妻」在伴——就是所謂「賢母良妻」——這在十九世紀的社會中，像這樣可悲亦可笑的事實是十分普通的。但是時到今日——「自由戀愛」，「婚姻自主」雖然到處高唱着，但是這由欺人的僞飾底「媒妁之言」而進行的婚姻竟依舊盛行，而這「惟利是圖」的「媒人」雖不知陷害了多少的青年男女而造成了無數的「曠夫怨婦」，但爲什麽他們仍舊在各處猖獗着呢？其原因，依一般的來說吧！</p>
<p>可恨亦可惡底封建殘餘之毒，深潛在一般「小有産」者以上的頑固陳朽底頭腦中。有兒子的人們，所以要急急地爲他們的兒子辦婚姻，那因爲他們有的是「金錢」；旣不憂「吃」，又不愁「穿」，所有的是同一的心意——「抱孫心切」。他們所要的是「好名」：日夜期待着的是不久後就可以得到他們的「同志」們——「志同道合」者們——稱之爲「子孫滿堂多福多壽」咧！這樣他們可得「同志」們的贊揚與羨慕，且又能得「傳宗接代」「榮耀祖上」了。</p>
<p>有女兒的呢，那末他們所有的主意是··女兒旣然到後來終有變爲「人家」的一天，則何苦多費着「養育」之金——當然也有嬌養着他們的「千金」，那是例外的。因此若一旦到了「差不多」的年齡——多數是「早婚」的吧——就時時豫算着把她們嫁給「人家」了——將她們「出賣」了。看吧——雙方是在這樣的條件之下；而且對於子女們的志向，將來的前途，畢身的幸福，那他們是不願亦不必顧問的，因爲他們知道這是他們「命裏制定」着的，可由他們的「運命」來决定的呀？！</p>
<p>好了，他們雙方只須待「媒人」們來顚倒是非的拉攏着，作這「交易」。說明雙方是怎樣地「門當户對」（？）以後，那就只須把子女們的「八字」請相家去「排」；而憑了這些「未卜先知的仙人」們說着「和合」或「相尅」，來斷定着子女們的「終身大事」了。而社會中想是因爲他們的「命運的决定」而增加了不少的熱閙了——「喜的悲劇」，「悲的喜劇」，請諸位注意着各大報的「社會新聞」格吧！</p>
<p>何奈在今日的社會組織中，一切的矛盾一日比一日的尖銳起來··世界經濟恐慌的激盪，農付經濟崩潰的浪潮，把失業者有增無减地湧滿了每一個城市；一般的不幸的人們都墮在這漩渦中諷狂的相軋相傾着作最後的掙扎而可憐的那生長在被封建殘餘所毒的家庭中底青年們，自身旣還没有能力來獨立——一般雖有相當能力與學識而不得出路的，正多着呢——而肩上又竟預定了一個「賢母良妻一與「傳宗接代」——那當然十九不是「經濟獨立」的了——與須「多子多孫」的極大底重担了。而事實上將告訴我們他來日的前途怎樣咧！</p>
<p>有爲的青年朋友們！要解放「舊禮敎的束縛」，奪取眞正的「自由」，那惟有努力的把這封建殘餘剷除，殲滅；但若要得到「自由戀愛」的眞諦，那只得待後日革新了的「社會組織」中去找了。</p>
<h3>悔恨</h3>
<p>— 玲子</p>
<p>—心理素描試筆—</p>
<p>當他向我表示着他是答應了我的話··「從此只是做朋友」，我的嘴唇雖然是在動着而飛出了這末一句話··「你也曉得如果不答應了我，以後連朋友都不做了」；可是我的心呀心裏就好像觸了電一樣的點驚訝而且後悔。到了我介紹芬和他相見以後聽他說芬表示着愛他，我不但後悔不該讓他去愛芬，而且恨了自己恨了他。</p>
<p>今天星期日我到他地裏、娘姨說他和一位小姐出去玩去了，這一句話正如一把尖利的刀戳進我的心，由悔而恨，莫名的醋意充滿了我的腦裏，我不恨他我恨芬了。我深深地感覺到··芬，她是我的情敵！在他的書房裏頭坐了一兩點鐘，本來不想翻他的抽屜，可是無聊得很想做點事，而且我恨芬，一股醋意激動了我的神經想要去找出芬給他的信來看，不料翻了他的抽屜，芬的信是找不到，（大約是藏在他身上）却找出了我前天給他約定今天來看他的信來，不看還則吧了，一看越想越恨，隨手將牠扯成碎片。他說做朋友。難道朋友的約會是可以失約的嗎？—然而，愛人終比朋友親切，芬來了難道要他不陪芬出去玩而留在家裏等我嗎？這末一想，我恨芬，同時又恨了自己··芬從我的懷裏將他奪去了，可恨，可是我自己不向他表示不能愛而且敎他去愛别人只做朋友，芬那裏能够搶奪他去了呢。我應該責備自己，爲什麽心裏明明還是在愛他，却爲了什麽前途不願和他相愛了呢？</p>
<p>他的桌上留着一碟糖菓，鵲可勒櫻花糖等等，銀色的紙，綠色的紙，紅色的紙，白色的紙，五光十色眞是可愛，隨手吃了幾口，望望窗外春雨絲絲地下着，正在納悶當兒，猛然地想起這些糖一定是他特别買來給芬吃的，而芬吃了一兩口怱怱拉他出去玩了，所以留下了這許多，一想起這，不願再吃了。但是同時又想起，這糖是他的，我愛他，他也愛我，爲什麽不吃他的糖呢，還留下給芬回來了吃不成？我偏要吃，吃牠個一乾二凈，一口都不給芬吃，於是乎就好像和他在吻着一樣，將糖菓一顆一顆地先吻了然後吃下肚子裏，然後在吃他的心的呵！</p>
<p>猛然地看見他桌上有一瓶玫瑰汁香酒，想起了他以前在喝酒是因爲了我表示不愛他的緣故，這回又在喝酒，一定還是忘不了我，而一方芬在愛他，受了矛盾的剌激不得不以酒澆愁，他說他恨我，他眞是在恨我的呵！</p>
<p>襄，你在恨我，你還不知道我更恨你呵！我說不愛你了，我說只是做朋友，以至於介紹芬給你，都不是眞心的，都是在試你的，而你這末的老實，信以爲眞，你在恨我，才不知道我現在是如何的後悔，如何的姤恨，····</p>
<p>想起這悔恨，不由得想要喝酒將自</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>己的神經麻醉一下··明知道酒酵的麻醉力量只是時間性的，一回兒酒醒來，愁恨更加深刻，可是我將他的玫瑰汁香酒倒了一滿杯仰首喝乾了。</p>
<p>好多年不喝酒，今天喝了之這麽一滿杯，不多一回兒醉了，眼前小金花四射，地板在動蕩，不由你心驚··他們回來了看見，將如何是好，這種醉態？急急地留下條子告訴他和芬說我來看他們，踉踉蹌蹌地走出了他的家，回學校來。</p>
<p>路上，春雨絲絲地下着，醉裏心定愁更愁，寒風吹來，打了一個冷痙，回到學校頭暈眼眩，摸着自己的床倒下去，昏昏然十分難受。</p>
<p>想起了今天的遭遇，我的眼淚淌下來了！</p>
<h3>流浪兒傳（十）</h3>
<p>— 陳靜生製</p>
<p>這根草眞靈騐勝利是咱們的</p>
<h3>探梅</h3>
<p>— 乾序</p>
<p>風雖是很大，吹到人的身上總是那麽暖洋洋的；人也懶懶地，不想做事。這種種，無疑的都在告訴人們說··「春天到了」。</p>
<p>春天，多麽的美麗　枯黃的草已經脫去她的憔悴的外衣，露出嬌羞的容顔了；嚴肅的表情，也不再在人們的臉上飛躍；池裏或者河裏的水，給春風吹出了富有詩意的縐紋··枝頭的小鳥，唱出的聲調也由悲哀而轉爲愉快；一切的一切，無非是充滿了「生」之氣息。雖然是全國不景氣的聲浪從每一扇的一大廉價一的　　上麗　的發出來，也不能衝　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　梅花，早就被定爲我們的「國花」了，這時已經應運的興感起來，於是，一般有閒並且有錢的老爺少爺們，「興」之所至，大做其「探梅」的「雅」舉。</p>
<p>我們是生就的旣忙且窮的「命」，歷年來没有「年」，没有「節」，並且也没有春天；整年的包圍在立體建築物的中間，祇知冷了穿衣，熱了卸裝，幾個寒暑都是糊裏糊塗地過去了。然而今年，終於是得了一個非常的機會，追隨了諸位老爺少爺之後，也玩了一次「有閒」與「有錢」所估有的「探梅」的盛舉。</p>
<p>因爲在我的整個的生命史上，似乎也可以佔這麽小小的一頁，所以把它記了下來··</p>
<p>是一個晴朗的早晨，温和的微風吹過了别人到了我們的身邊的時候，我們眞有點陶醉了。啊！這可愛的大自然。</p>
<p>本來，過慣了機械似的生活，一旦能够投向大自然的懷中去享受素來夢想不到的滋味，是多麽的熱望而愉快火車在埋着頭狂奔，不時發出嗘吼的呌聲；兩旁的電桿，連排的退向後面去；碧綠的原野，黝黑的農人，唱着不按節拍的聲調的賣物者，在我們懷着愉快的目光中看去、無一不是充滿着「活」的氣象。</p>
<p>三小時的顚簸在愉快裏是不會覺得苦的，我們終於踏進了無錫的「梅園」，成萬株的梅樹綴滿着花朶，香味洋溢在人們的四周，我們跟着其他的同志們—當然是「探梅」同志—亂跑，我們一樣的爬到高處去看靜蕩蕩的太湖，我們一樣的在人叢中看高貴而漂亮的女士、大概是生就的「旣忙且窮」的「命」吧，我們終於覺得「索然」了。我們商議走，我們要回上海，三小時的顚簸在垂頭傷氣中過去，覺得是旣「長」而且「苦」。</p>
<p>熱望和愉快已成過去，「活」的氣象也在眼前消失了，我們明瞭這種「雅舉」究竟是「有閒」們的玩意兒，决不是我們這一般的旣忙且窮的所可幹的，而格外使我們戰慄的是消失了「活」的氣象後的「社會不景氣」！</p>
<p>精神，時間，金錢的一度浪費後的收穫，便是使我重新耐心於枯寂的生活，而永永打破了紫色的夢。</p>
<h3>由尋死說到偷生</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>社會學家說，自殺也是一種傳染症，這話果然不錯，看邇近上海自殺事件之繼續發生，可以證實。</p>
<p>自殺究竟是有意義的，還是無價值的？勇敢的，還是怯懦的？值得同情的，還是值得非難的？我以爲這話很難判斷。貪生怕死，本是人之常情。一個人而至於跑上自殺之路，非萬不獲已，决不出此。所以自殺的人，自有其非自殺不可的原因存在着，不是旁觀者所能輕加贊　或攻訐的。無論批評家的理由若何完滿，設易地以處，恐怕本身也有些難以自主呢？然而自殺對於社會之影響，却是一種不良的現象，這點是誰也不得不承認的。</p>
<p>一般指摘自殺者皆同聲地說。人爲社會的動物，該以社會作前提，爲社會去奮鬥，才算合理；而自殺者却反乎是，專爲個人的苦樂着想，致放棄了對社會應盡的責任，其舉動顯然是錯誤的。但爲社會動物的人，到底有幾個能做到這一個地步？自殺就說牠是無價值的，怯懦的，值得非難的行爲吧；我們這一班還活着的人，總算是有意義的，勇敢的，值得同情的的份子了；然而社會受到了我們的益處没有？我們向社會貢獻了什麽？我們爲社會去怎樣犧牲過努力過？我們已盡了我們對社會應盡的義務了嗎？如果對於這幾個問題，我們無從提出滿意的解答，那末我們的話，最多也只能說是一時的偷生而已，其實也並没有什麽重大的意義！所以我說：與其偷生，不若尋死！</p>
<h3>哭文</h3>
<p>— 尼兒</p>
<p>國片姊妹花開映以來，達二十··日、個個稱奇，人人道好。據說（因爲作者二度被客滿牌擯諸門外，感車費之損失不貲，未敢冒險作第三度之嘗試）尤以胡蝶一哭博得觀衆眼淚不少。昨天前樓寗波阿嫂對我說：「　先生，姊妹花眞嶄，看得阿拉眼淚「達達」流出來！</p>
<p>哭何感人之深耶？</p>
<p>說着哭，就想起哭，一包眼淚不禁迷住了眼睛，於是提出筆來作哭文，幸清明節近，哭哭何妨。</p>
<p>哭有眞哭，假哭。若姊妹中之哭（誠以未飽耳福爲憾）假哭也。觀者以假作眞，陪着大流眼淚（作爲果有其事）太不值得。前天隔　死了一個男人，其妻　棺大　，此眞哭也。夫夫者。謂之所天，旣喪其天，可以大哭。然而旁觀者却以聽哭而來，反以人家之號陶大哭爲樂事，誠百思令人莫解者也！如死者之妻得知觀者對姊妹花之情形，恐亦將反哭爲笑，與弔者大悅。</p>
<p>眞哭假哭之外，亦有似眞似假，非眞非假之哭。若有心人，隨處可以發見。然作文以通俗爲主，特舉一例··老牌滑稽以哭名於時，月入較上海市長爲優，而一滑而後，身後蕭條，於是哭人者亦被人哭矣。不見（應作聽）無綫電中啊···次之聲，使人作嘔。彼哭者以老牌爲祖師，所以哭老牌滑稽者一若祭文之示哀悼也，然而似眞似假，非眞非假，哭得堂會源源而來，亦可說利用哭之能事。老牌有靈，昔日哭名掃地乎？</p>
<p>至於若貓哭老鼠之假慈悲，其某詩人某作家死後之謂乎。此哭也，彼悼也，詩人作家不被重於生時，而成名於死後。尼兒不敏，推薦爲文壇登龍新術，著者章君有意乎？</p>
<p>獨居作哭文，不覺涕淚之何從，本欲一哭再哭，惟恐哭能傷神，以關生命，暫作結束，以待續哭。</p>
<p>哭罷投筆，大笑三聲，俾收付相抵，以重衛生。</p>
<h3>小問題</h3>
<p>— 尼兒</p>
<p>出門没有汽車代步今的電車階級，多少感到銅元是最討厭的東西。一枚雙毫到烟紙店里兌換，就是四十多個，如其在夏天，確是够麻煩··然而電車上的代價（從前）是四十枚，爲不願莫名其妙損失起見，討厭只好討厭。</p>
<p>自己是每天坐電車的，麻煩已成了習慣。不過在不久之前，電車上，乘客一時都　　　　。　原來雙毫　　　降至四十五枚，而電車章程却漲到四十</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>四枚。這樣没有　　算術的人也知道其簡相差僅銅元一枚　　省了兌換的麻煩　續，損失了祇一枚　元，倒底還吃虧得起，所以何樂而不爲呢！</p>
<p>現在雙毫的市價又回到四十八枚了，電車上乘客以雙毫購票同時不復多見，我認爲和航空獎劵開彩是大晚報漲價同是一個小問題。因爲如其一旦而雙毫的市價降至四十三，或四十二···枚，電車公司當局不知怎樣辦法？</p>
<p>業餘信箱</p>
<h3>進退兩難</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我有一個朋友原籍廣東，於民國十八年，在汕頭作客，有一老嫗很滿意我的朋友的人格，願將其最愛的養女，許配我的朋友。因爲該老嫗没有子息，僅有這個養女，故愛如掌珠。要我朋友作他的贅壻。後來我的朋友用了三百大洋和他的女兒結婚（當時没有訂過什麽條件）現在已生一子有三四歲了。但我的朋友，鄉下家裏的父母，早已和他娶有妻室，且已生有一女。我的朋友與該嫗女兒未結婚之前，他們母女也知道我的朋友鄉下已有妻子的，可知他們的婚姻都是出於兩家心願。今我的朋友因汕市生活困難，要帶他妻子回鄉下去同住，不料他們母女均不肯回，弄得我的朋友無法對待，想與他離異，又舍不得兒子；若與他和好，又是始終無益。現在進退兩難，不知如何是好，故特請爾老先生設個良善辦法。並望爾在本業餘欄内答復下列幾種問題：</p>
<p>（一）這種婚姻的結合依法是否有效騐</p>
<p>（二）生下的孩子應歸何人所有？</p>
<p>（三）贅壻的手續怎樣才能成立？像這種無字據的贅壻，於法律上可能成立麽？</p>
<p>（四）今我的朋友想不認贅壻，去法院起訴，可能爭回他的兒子麽？</p>
<p>上列各種，統祈答復。這是我十二分感激爾的。費爾的神，容圖報謝。</p>
<p>弟張球敬上</p>
<p>答：重婚本來是一椿很不合理的事。張君的朋友旣然在鄉下娶有妻室，就不應該再做人家贅壻。可是事已過去，說他做甚。現在我們就討論討論你的朋友究竟應當採取什麽辦法罷？</p>
<p>從你來信中，字裏行間，隱約地看出你的朋友和他汕市的妻子是没有愛情了。假如你的朋友十分愛戀着汕市的妻子，那卽使生活困難，恐怕也寗願在窮困飢寒之下與生活掙扎，决不肯退一步想，回到鄉下去的。而且因爲她們不肯回去，他就要與他們脫離，所捨不得的祗是一個「兒子」，一個人那裏會洒脫到如此。再從女的方面論，如果她眞能想信他，她眞能體貼到他的苦處，那卽使她同他回鄉下去了，與自己有許多不便，也定然是肯與他回去的。所以，編者根據這種推測，敢於斷定他們的愛情是破裂了。雙方受情旣然破裂，則編者認爲他們還是爽爽快快地雙方恊議脫離，不必再勉强繼續下去。但這祗是編者一種意見，或許你朋友還别有苦衷，所以這個辦法祗能供你友參考。</p>
<p>所詢問題四則，答覆如下：</p>
<p>（一）依法無效。</p>
<p>（二）應爲你朋友及其妻所共有，</p>
<p>（三）法律上並無一定條件規定。</p>
<p>（四）父子及母子關係血統，不能脫離，自母須告爭。編者</p>

<h3>露露的勝利（十）（三）</h3>
<p>— 義大利Ｍ賽拉歐著景心譯</p>
<p>「一個在這里，另一個在那里，」她囁嚅着；「可是在這以前呢？够了！我必要帮一帮忙。」</p>
<p>「就因爲這麽許多有力的理由，我不能够同着羅勃特。孟特甫蘭寇結婚。」最後露露對她的母親說。</p>
<p>「你的這些理由都怪誕極了，我的女兒，」那母親回答，搖着她的頭。</p>
<p>「簡而言之。我必要坦白地清楚地告訴你，羅勃特並不使我歡喜，因此我不想和他結婚。」</p>
<p>「這話一點不不坦白；這只是一種怪想頭。羅勃特是愛着你的。」</p>
<p>「他會安慰他自己的。」</p>
<p>「你們已經交換過緍約了。」</p>
<p>「我們可以把它們取消的。我們已經不是活在從前的時候了，人們可以强迫結婚。」</p>
<p>「社會非難怎麽好呢？」</p>
<p>「母親，社會是怎麽一種東西？」</p>
<p>「人們。」</p>
<p>「「人們」先生是誰呢？我不認識他；我不能因爲「人們」先生便使自己不幸」</p>
<p>「你是一個怕人的女兒！但是我怎麽好和羅勃特去交談呢？我和他怎樣說法呢？」</p>
<p>「隨你怎麽說吧。你是我的母親你應當曉得怎樣作。」</p>
<p>「啊，的確是！收拾你惹下了的禍。一定有流言起來的。」</p>
<p>「我不這樣想；你可以大大方地開明地講。眞的，我想你可以把我說得」</p>
<p>壞一些——稱我是任意，輕挑，幼稚；你就說我不會作一個好妻子，我一點都不認眞，我缺少尊嚴，而你要說我姊姊是——」</p>
<p>「你的姊姊？你迷了心啦吧，露露！」</p>
<p>「嘘！你很容易這樣講的。在目前，羅勃特和蘇菲亞彼此是很冷淡的，但如果他們能够互切地認識了，他們可以互相地親密了，於是——這誰能說得了？你如果先使你的大女兒結了婚，人們會稱讚你是一個好母親的。」</p>
<p>「的確是——」</p>
<p>「我不會没有丈夫就這樣下去的··我剛剛十八歲。我還願意使自己快活一」</p>
<p>些；我還是跳很多的舞··我願意消度我的青春伴着我的親愛的善良的小母親—</p>
<p>——」</p>
<p>「你是一個小流氓，」母親回答着，受了感動，擁抱着她的女兒。</p>
<p>「我們是彼此理解了吧？公開地把這醜惡的消息傳給羅勃特，但是要加上說我們必要永久地作朋友，而且我們希望時常看見他。如果這兩個人是彼此地愛着，他們儘可不必顧慮；這是命中注定的。」</p>

<h3>麥穆林論葛雷泰·嘉寳（下）</h3>
<p>— 袁琳</p>
<p>還有，故事的高潮，在片子裏是在她讓位的時候，在實際呢，假使將她的生活寫成眞實的小說，大概應該在她出門漂泊的時候。同時，我們還將她讓位的動機，假定做對於某一外國人的戀愛。</p>
<p>除了這些故意錯悞之外，影片的一切，可以說和歷史没有兩樣。我絶對相信嘉寳的才能，她的這種才能，一定可以現出她平時夢想着的克烈絲蒂一般的異常的個性。實際上，她也是直到簽定了扮演這個脚色的合同之後，方才决定從歐洲回來。</p>
<p>這影片不是歌舞片，不是童話劇，也不是單純的衣裳炫耀於觀衆的作品。換句話講，這是不屬於任何過去在曾經在電影，演劇，乃至無綫電的分野裏面獲得過成功的作品。</p>
<p>最近，我有點討厭那些目下盛行的所謂演劇電影。對於偉大的戲曲，我是非常地愛好，但祇限定在舞臺上面，或者書籍裏面。在那祇重映像的活動，而並不需要美麗的文章的銀幕，反而引起反感。在最近的將來，我確信這兩種藝術（演劇與電影）一定會成爲各有特徴的東西。在我的作品裏面，要想展開一種依着故事之進展而進行的永續的節奏，就是這個原故。</p>
<p>嘉寳，是偉大的！她，有她的才能！—不，在才能之外，她還有别的東西。當我看她工作的時候，感覺到好像在一個過去的人物身上突然地貫注了一種强烈的生命力而開始活動似的情况。</p>
<p>人們大概知道，嘉寳不歡喜在她不認識的人們面前演戲，可是在攝影的時候，除了一切的演員和導演之外，大概還有編劇的人們出席，加上，電氣技師，攝影師，助手，收音技師，收音助手，記錄導演言語的女子塲記員，有時候，還有拍宣傳用呆片的照相師，剪接員等等，都在裏面走來走去。攝影塲的空氣，對於敏感的演員，的確是過於刺激的。所以，在嘉寳一般易感的女性，除了上述的人們之外，還要被多數閑看的人們包圍，的確是一椿難以忍耐的事情。因爲，她還没有上過舞臺的經騐啊。</p>
<p>但是她對於一直工作着的攝影師威廉·譚尼爾以及我們始終在一起工作的人們，她眞是一個非常和靄的女性。我老是看見她悄悄地和那些臨時女演員們談話。她，非常的歡喜天眞爛漫的孩子，她常常召集許多在她近處玩耍的孩子，並且親自動手在煖爐前面請他們吃瑞典式的點心。我想在這種時候，才是她最幸福的時間呢。</p>
<p>在歐洲住得很久的嘉寳，變成了比以前還要孤獨。歸美以來，她祇出席過一次瑪琳·黛德利絲的「戀歌」的試映。不論她的理由怎樣，讓我們來尊敬她的沈默和孤獨吧！（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「將軍運」</h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>“ＦＲＯＮＴＩＥＲＭＡＲＳＨＡＬ”</p>
<p>—大上海—</p>
<p>在千篇一律的英雄美人的「西部影片」中，「將軍運」要算是較好的一張了。</p>
<p>像我們在國産片裏看慣了兒戲式的搏鬥，而極度地起了厭惡的心一樣，不能不厭惡起「西部影片」裏英雄們的武術來。「將軍運」裏的一套，也不過是這麽一回事，美國電影製作的浪費，眞使人可驚。</p>
<p>但是，「將軍運」所描寫的無惡不作的市長，却是很好的。</p>
<p>那個市長，表面上是「民主政治」下對民衆負責的最高地方官，實際却是個坐地分贓的匪徒，暗殺犯！</p>
<p>自然，這樣一位市長，是所謂民主政治的很好的解釋；不過，「將軍運」的劇作者的認識不能不有一個缺點，他只能看到這位劣跡昭彰的市長的貪汚，却不能看到「民主政治」的本質就是在上的一個社會層對於下層的踐踏。</p>
<p>英雄魏迪，不必說得，他是豪爽，而又有憐憫弱者的慈悲心腸，如他在往湯士頓去的車中遇見了瑪麗便愛慕她，知道了她的父親被害，才决定暫留於湯士頓暗暗保護她。他是有肝胆，而又講義氣和愛打抱不平，和他親訪湯士頓的巨匪，警察不敢捉的彭恩而他却偏要去捉，到華倫隱隱告訴了一些市長的劣跡，他便極力探索，要懲罰這貪官汚吏。　　於是，我們的英雄感動了華倫，更感動了先前的敵人彭思。瑪麗當然會愛他了，還有個酒館裏的女郎景琦也愛他，甚至把自己的生命爲他而犧牲。</p>
<p>爲什麽「將軍運」在結末暗寫了市長伏誅，而極力描寫了景琦的犧牲與魏迪瑪麗的愛的成功呢？很容易明白的，殺死萬惡的貪官，對於「名敎」究竟很有關係的，而景琦的死和瑪麗的（ＴＨＲＯＷＳＨ）</p>
<p>ＥＲＳＥＬＦＩＮＴＯＷＹＡＴＴ’ＳＡＲＭＳ），正是英雄的勝利品。</p>
<p>華倫和彭恩的描寫，自然「將軍運」中只有他們的蠻勇，義氣和崇拜英雄，至於他們爲什麽會變成匪類的？他們的</p>
<p>崇拜英雄，義氣，蠻勇的觀念怎樣造成的？在「將軍運」中是找不出答案的。</p>
<p>這是「將軍運」的劇作者所不會去理解的地方；不僅這些，更重要的，現在的所謂「西部影片」也者，都是只看到牧塲上「馬背飛躍，鎗無虚發」，而又「温香在抱，情無虚擲」的英雄，却不看見宛轉哀號於農業恐慌中的廣大農民，不看見這些農民們在無可忍耐的壓迫下知道了農業救濟法的無效，而警覺了自己的力量。</p>
<p>雖然如此，「將軍運」之細膩的風格，究竟打破了西部影片的粗率的筆調，如（一）魏迪與華倫杯酒言歡，（二）景琦之死，（三）描寫魏迪瑪麗，景琦的三角戀愛等處都很成功的，這也是故事的本身適宜於這樣的風格吧。</p>
<p>音響構成與畫面構成的密切而有機的聯票，應該提出來說一說的，如魏迪捕盜的塲面，很能表現出當時的空氣。　　在演員中，喬治奥勒靈的魏迪，當然很拿手的。飾瑪麗，華倫，景琦，市長諸人也很努力。</p>
<p>然而，英雄美人的西部影片的黃金時代，終究逝世了，在中國旣厭棄了「火燒　　」而并不高明得多的美國武俠片，恐怕也是不會歡迎吧，我們期待着一部比較接觸着美國西部的社會的實際的新片。</p>
<h3>離婚夫婦的見面禮</h3>
<p>— 覆</p>
<p>離婚之後的夫婦，久别重逢的時候，怎樣相見法，這大概没有一個定例吧？現在我叙述一個很有趣的先例，你們有用時，大可以取法一下。</p>
<p>小范朋克從歐洲回到好萊塢去。他和瓊克勞馥是「友誼離婚」的夫婦，所以他到好萊塢的時候，瓊克勞馥想到飛機塲去迎接他，不過許多明將她拉住了，不讓她去。原因係恐怕這叚新聞給報紙登載出去，大家會誤會她和小范朋克將破鏡重圓的。現在瓊和法蘭却東（ＦＲＡＮＣＨＯＴ　ＬＯＮＥ）已經相愛，不久即將宣告婚約。這一來，恐怕又惹出許多是非出來。因此她就没有去，而打了一個電話給他，請他到她的庽所裏來。他來了。他們相見之時，歡然地一握手，並不相吻。於是瓊就挽着她前夫的手臂，到房子的各室巡視了一下，指點着許多新的傢俱，裝飾物，係分居後所新置的。小范朋克一一贊賞着她的聰明。最後他們就到了起坐間。他們二人坐下了談着一切非家務的事。在這個時候法蘭却東登塲了。小范覺得侷促嗎？不！一些也不！他們二人居然暢談起來。所談的都是關於攝影塲上的一切。他們談了兩個鐘頭，竟將瓊置之腦後，而瓊呢，竟看着兩個前夫後夫（注意··不是先夫後夫）的感情融洽，也就顧而樂之了。</p>
<p>這不是我們中國人，離婚之後就避不見面的，所應當效法的嗎？</p>
<h3>陳凝秋上舞臺</h3>
<p>青年會將於星期六與星期日公演「ＬＡＤＩＥＳＡＮＤＧＥＮＴＬＥＭＥＮ」、已於前略見本刊。近二日排演甚忙，空氣堪爲緊張。電影明星陳凝秋趙丹等又連日前往參觀。據云，他們二人已在和「高貴的人們」之編者商量，可否再來一個「下賤的人們」？凌鶴說··「好的，等着有機會的時候，我們再來一次罷」。</p>
<p>又，凌鶴爲了忙於舞臺，連影评評也來不及寫。等到正式公演，我想一定有着很好的成績罷。不然，凌鶴决不會如此賣力。</p>

<h3>凱塞琳女皇ＳＣＡＲＬＥＴＥＭＰＲＥＳＳ（七）</h3>
<p>— 素梅</p>
<p>凱塞琳騎着馬回來了，亞萊克賽迎着她。他低聲地對她說道：「我一時一刻的思念，都没有停止過。我一定要和你兩個談一談。」凱塞琳對他看着冷冷的道：「小心些。人人的眼睛都在看着我們：他們會去告訴我丈夫的。」亞萊克𥈽很着急似的道：「明天早晨你出去騎馬的時候，我們在馬廐相見。那裏没有人看見的—我會設法的。凱塞琳道：「我明天不騎馬什麽辦呢？」亞萊克賽眼睛看着她，發出懇求的聲音道：「你亦要去的。亦没有人會知道的。」</p>
<p>凱塞琳回到自己的寢室裏，她在更衣的時候、露着很高興的神氣。瑪麗正帮助他穿衣服，看見了就問她道：「現在殿下興致很好，是不是去會見你的丈夫呢？」凱塞琳很不自在的笑道：「哦，我都忘記了我還有個丈夫呢。」瑪麗很調皮的說道，「那末，殿下，我恐怕你將要去會見你的情人吧。」凱塞琳道：「瑪麗，你亦是過壞東西，難道你亦有個情人嗎？」瑪麗道：「我有了情人倒好人。在這裏没有人没有情人的。他們全有，就是我一個人没有。」凱塞琳道：「我想我們的女皇陛下，是不見得有情人的。」瑪麗道：「嚇，她没有？她的情人才多哩，一個月就換一個。」她說完了又向凱塞琳央告道：「你可千萬不可告訴别人，說是我說的。不然，我的舌頭就要拔掉了。」凱塞琳安慰她道：「你放心，我不會告訴别人的。我亦不相信你的話。但是我是没有情人的：我今天高興，因爲我要去見我的母親去。」一瑪麗聽見了，面色立即變了。她說：「我的殿下呀，你不知道嗎？」凱塞琳道：「知道什麽？」瑪麗道：「你的母親不是已經回德國去了嗎。她是昨晚半夜動身的！是女皇陛下半夜打發她回去的。</p>
<p>凱塞琳一時覺得手足無所措似的，東張西望着說道：「怎麽她说没有和我見一見面呢？」她說完了，立卽出去尋女皇去了。那時女沙皇正在舉行着國務會議，凱塞琳突然地闖了進去。女皇就怒聲責備她，不應當不被召就闖進來，但是凱塞琳毫不畏懼的，眼睛睜大了問道：「你爲什麽把，我母親打發走了？」女皇站了起來駡道：「你來責問我嗎，你這小混蛋？」他很很地對着凱塞琳道：「我打發走你的母親，就因爲她没有好好地敎訓你。我呌你到這裏來。是爲要使你成爲一個賢妻，並且替俄國的皇位生出一個嗣子出來。現在你馬上給我滾出去！」她說完了，就拉着鈴，她所寵幸的侍衛長意凡舒佛羅天進來了。她吩咐他將大公夫人送到她自己的宫裏去。她說：「那裏我自己的眼睛，可以看着她！敎她怎樣才可以做一個俄國的妻子！」（未完）</p>

<h3>Jin-Sui Army Breaks Through Sun Bu's Defense Line</h3>
<p>Continuing Westward from Bulun Nur</p>
<p>Sansheng Palace Completely Occupied</p>
<p>Fu Zhan Kui Telegraphs that Sun's Intention to Leave the Army is Extremely Firm</p>
<p>Only Requests That Arrears in Pay for His Troops Be Cleared Before Leaving</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi telegraphed from Baotou to Beiping, stating that Zhao Chengshou's cavalry regiment advanced to Bulun Nur on the 15th. Sun's army, Dou Lianxi's brigade, retreated towards Dengkou. The infantry unit of Wang's army, Shi's regiment, has already crossed Yangjia River westward and is expected to reach Bulun Nur early on the 16th. There are still over a thousand remnants of Sun's army in the Tianxingquan area, and troops have been dispatched westward to pursue them. Fu plans to personally go to Linhe to supervise the army within days. (16th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Linhe telegram: The Jin-Sui army is advancing rapidly towards Dengkou. At Yangshumu Tou in Sansheng Palace, over a thousand soldiers of Sun's army were captured. Apart from a portion who surrendered their weapons, the majority were disabled veterans of the anti-Japanese war, many of whom are gathered in Linhe. The first batch of 386 people will be transported and sent away on the 16th. (16th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Sui telegram: After the Jin-Sui army occupied key points such as Tianxingquan and Sansheng Palace yesterday, the vanguard of the cavalry has approached Dengkou on the morning of the 16th. Fu, Wang, and Feng Yuxi's brigade are actively advancing westward and can capture Dengkou today or tomorrow. Although Sun has declared his intention to leave the army, he is actually still resisting stubbornly. It is also reported that Wang and others have telegraphed Yan to report their victory. (16th Day Special Dispatch) (Beiping) Linhe telegram: After Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengshou's infantry and cavalry occupied Bulun Nur on the 14th, they continued to advance westward on the morning of the 15th. At Tianxingquan, 60 li west of Bulun Nur, the enemy resisted in pre-built fortifications. After the infantry launched a fierce frontal assault and the cavalry attacked from both flanks, a large encirclement was formed. The enemy was in a panic and retreated. The Tianxingquan line was thus broken through. Sansheng Palace, only 10 li from Tianxingquan, could no longer be defended. Furthermore, Wang Tingying's brigade of Fu Wang's army and Sun Changsheng's cavalry brigade have completely occupied Tianxingquan and Sansheng Palace. The enemy is fleeing in a disarray towards Dengkou. One battalion of Dou Lianxi's served as the rearguard, but failed to retreat in time and was completely disarmed. Currently, the cavalry vanguard has approached Dengkou, and Fu, Wang, and Feng Yuxi's brigades are actively advancing. Dengkou can be recovered within days. (16th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zhan Kui traveled south from Dengkou on the 12th, passing through Shizuizi and Pingluo, and arrived at Ligangpu on the evening of the 14th. Sun Dianying had arrived earlier. The result of their meeting was that Sun did not insist on leaving the army, but requested that the arrears in pay for his army be issued before he left, and that proper arrangements be made for the resettlement of his troops. It seems that he still intends to make demands. It is heard that the authorities have decided to ignore Sun's demands and will continue to implement the established policy, urging all encircling and suppressing forces to advance in order to force Sun to come to his senses in a short period. Sun's army has repeatedly failed to capture Ningxia, and since the day before yesterday, it has launched a major offensive against Pingluo with its main force, posing an extremely fierce threat. (16th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lanzhou telegram: Liu Yueting's division of Sun's army attempted to cross the Helan Mountains and flee to the Liang area, but was defeated by Ma Buqing's forces, suffering heavy losses. Ma's forces arrived near Pingluo on the 15th. (16th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zhan Kui telegraphed on the 12th, Bao Wen Yue relayed that Pang Hu Ji etc. said, the process of my contact with brother Dianying has already been detailed in yesterday's telegram. Brother Dianying is resolutely resigning and has already made a twelve-part decision. After a little arrangement, he can travel with me. We will also return to Peiping to report. (16th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ji Yiqiao and others expressed to Sun, news has it that a telegram has been sent to Fu Zhankui. Roughly, if Sun can leave the army, his safety and living expenses will not be a problem, and they can be responsible for it. However, the issues of the reorganization and resettlement of the unit will be handled by the successor in accordance with the central government's orders, which has nothing to do with Sun's personal departure. (16th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain military officer said that before 1932, all armies in the country were in arrears with their pay. It is really difficult to clear the arrears that Sun Dianying requests. After the Northern Expedition was completed in 1927, the central armies were downsized for the first time, and all the disbanded units were also owed nine months' pay, which has not been repaid. Therefore, Sun's demand is intentionally making things difficult, which proves that he is unwilling to leave the army. The vanguard of the Jin-Sui army will arrive at Dengkou soon. There are only one or two thousand men of Lu Fengnian's unit occupying the vicinity of Dengkou, so it is only a matter of time. (16th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing office of the 15th Route Headquarters received a telegram from Ningxia on the 16th, stating: (1) The remnants of Sun's army north of Ningyuan are still stubbornly resisting in their strongholds, making a last-ditch effort. Yuan's brigade of the Central First Division has now arrived in the suburbs of Ning. The Jin-Sui army is attacking the Sansheng Palace area and occupying Tianxingquan, and the situation for a joint annihilation has been formed, making it easy to fundamentally resolve the issue. (2) The enemy besieging Pingluo uses artillery bombardment from time to time, but not only do they not dare to approach, but they also plan to dispatch a portion of their troops to Shizuishan to build fortifications to resist the Sui army. (16th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Baotou: At dawn on the 15th, Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengshou personally supervised all infantry, cavalry, and artillery units to launch a fierce attack on Sansheng Palace. After several hours of fierce fighting, the artillery fire was intense. Initially, the left flank of Sun's army wavered and gradually became unsustainable. Then, Lu Fengnian suddenly led over 400 of his guards to supervise the team to counterattack, and the force was fierce. After the Jin-Sui army hit them hard, there were many deaths and injuries, and Sun's army began to collapse completely. At 11 a.m., the Jin-Sui army completely occupied Sansheng Palace. In this battle, Sun's army was killed and captured countless times. The Jin-Sui army is currently continuing to pursue Dengkou. (16th Day Central News Agency Electric)</p>

<h3>Li Chunhua and Others Issue a Circular Telegram Announcing that They Will No Longer Cooperate with Sun</h3>
<p>Relocating to the Yuquan Ying Area</p>
<p>Obeying the Orders of the Military Branch Council</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Ningxia on the 14th reported that 14 Northeast military officers, including Li Chunhua, issued a circular telegram announcing their withdrawal from the war zone and their non-cooperation with Sun Dianying. The original telegram stated: To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the President of the National Government's Executive Yuan, Wang; the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Chiang; the Chairman of Beiping, He; the Deputy Commander of Hankou, Zhang; all heads of departments and commissions; all Pacification Directors; all commanders and deputy commanders of bandit suppression; all commanders of armies, divisions, and brigades; all provincial and municipal governments; all levels of party headquarters; all legal entities; all newspapers, and forwarding to the entire nation: Ever since the September 18th Incident, countless Northeast men, women, old, and young have died under the iron hooves of the violent Japanese. Wherever the invading cavalry went, villages were reduced to ruins. Looting and burning were inhumane. Chunhua could not bear to see the people suffer, so he gathered patriotic Northeast soldiers and fought alongside them. From Liaoning to Rehe to Chahar, they fought across thousands of miles, shedding blood for years. What did Chunhua hope for? Nothing more than to let the imperialists know that the great Chinese nation is not to be insulted. After the Beiping Rescue the Nation Support Association, General Li Ziqiao and Mr. Wang Huayi, ordered him to cooperate with Army Commander Sun Dianying and implement the original intention of resisting Japan, and led his troops to retreat to the Northwest. In fact, it was intended to follow Goujian's principle of recuperation and training in order to recover the lost territories of the Northeast. Unfortunately, a conflict occurred along the way, and they confronted each other for two months. Not to mention the bankruptcy of rural areas, the cutting off of livelihoods, and the boiling of popular grievances, who should be blamed? It is still feared that the greedy and insatiable Japanese bandits will take advantage of the situation, and the area north of the Yellow River will once again become a continuation of the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. When the snipe and clam fight, the fisherman benefits. Whenever I think of this, I cannot help but feel heartbroken. On the 9th, I convened a public discussion with all military officers and soldiers to determine our actions. The decision was made that Sun's troops were advancing westward against orders, and we were indeed deceived. Fortunately, we are not far from the wrong path. How can we allow one mistake to be repeated? Moreover, how can we resist foreign aggression if internal strife does not stop? How can we avoid foreign countries laughing at the internal fighting of the same kind? We must adhere to the original intention of loving the country and loving our hometown, leave a glimmer of hope, and serve as a rear guard for continuing the anti-Japanese resistance, supporting national unity and establishing a strong government, so that the lost territories can be recovered and the Japanese invaders can be driven out. Our Northeastern elders, brothers, sisters, who have been displaced and lost their homes, may have the possibility of seeing the light of day again and returning to their hometowns together. Therefore, it was decided to withdraw from the war zone immediately and, in accordance with the orders of General Commander Ma, relocate to the Yuquan Ying area. From now on, we will only follow the orders of the Beiping Military Branch Council, and we will establish contact with the National Army to promote peace. Chunhua is straightforward in nature. He does not fawn upon others, and he does not condone things easily. There is no such thing as gratitude or resentment, no such thing as enemy or friend. He follows the will of the masses as soon as possible, and takes justice as his orientation. I hope that the wise men of the world will understand this. Li Chunhua, Gu Guanjun, Yu Wanshu, Wang Yongyi, Li Haifeng, Wang Jianqiu, Wang Huichun, Wang Yunchao, Wen Yuedong, Tu Delin, Shang Datao, Li Zemin, Wang Shouluan, Bai Chengshi, respectfully kowtow.

<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying arrived in Peiping from Zhangjiakou today and is scheduled to meet with He tomorrow morning to report on the recent situation in Eastern Chahar and the reorganization of various mixed troops stationed there. According to him, the Japanese troops in Eastern Chahar have been rotating their troops recently, but there have been no new movements. However, the 7th Division has been arriving successively and will establish a headquarters in Duolun. It is not yet clear whether the 8th Division, which is still in the Duolun-Guyuan area, will leave. It is worth noting whether the Japanese troops are rotating or reinforcing troops this time. Currently, there are over 1,000 Japanese troops between Guyuan and Duolun. Airplanes come and go every day to transport ammunition and supplies, actively preparing for military action. The Japanese troops in the 2nd and 4th districts of Guyuan are also actively repairing roads. Eastern Chahar is fraught with crisis, and the provincial government has reported to the Central Government. Zhang Renjie's troops have not all defected. It was only two companies of a certain regiment in the unit that wanted to act freely. The regimental commander stopped it and therefore no incident occurred. Zhang Renjie is still in Zhangjiakou. The unit will begin moving to Zhangbei starting today. The provincial government has ordered Liu Ruming's troops to take over the defense area of Chicheng and Longmensuo left behind. The principle of establishing a special diplomatic commissioner's office in Chahar Province has been determined, but the candidate has not yet been decided. Song Zheyuan is scheduled to come to Peiping from Tianjin on the 17th or 18th. Qin Dechun will have to wait until Song arrives before he can come to Peiping. At that time, they will discuss everything with He. (16th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

On the 16th, according to military attache Tani Ogi of the Japanese Embassy, the rotation of Japanese troops in Eastern Chahar has been completed long ago. Recently, due to the mutinous actions of Zhang Renjie's old troops, fearing that they would flee eastward, a part was specially dispatched to Heidayingzi to stand guard and there was no plan for anything. Currently, there are no Japanese troops in Duolun and Qingfengtuo. The puppet troops of Li Shouxin's unit in Guyuan have set up their own banner and severed ties with the puppet organization. The Japanese army will not take action for the time being. The puppet police in Nantianmen have also withdrawn.

<h3>Jin Shuren Case Opens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Foreign Aggression Part was Tried and Confronted with Aysä</p>
<p>Trial of Other Parts Continues Today</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangsu High Court held a trial for the Jin Shuren case at the Beijing Local Court's criminal court on the afternoon of the 16th. Security was tight and there were more than 200 observers. At 1:35, Presiding Judge Lu Wenlan, Judges Fang Wen and Si Wen, Prosecutor Shen Bingqian, and clerks took their seats in the courtroom and announced the trial. Jin was immediately brought to court. The defendant's lawyers Zhang Shaozeng, Tang Ying, and Wang Ruilin, and the accuser Aysä, etc., were also present. Jin wore a brown serge, black sheepskin robe, and a black silk melon-skin cap, with a short beard and a slightly haggard appearance, but no signs of illness. The presiding judge asked about his age, place of origin, address, and occupation. Prosecutor Shen stated the grounds for the prosecution, saying that Jin's criminal facts, based on those already prosecuted, consisted of four parts: (1) Foreign aggression: In October 1931, the defendant, seeing the benefits of foreigners, purchased military equipment and signed the New Soviet-Xinjiang Trade Agreement with the Soviet Union without authorization, humiliating the country and forfeiting its sovereignty, committing a crime under Article 118 of the Criminal Law. (2) Embezzlement of public funds: Jin left the government after the political coup, carrying more than 800,000 public funds and more than 1,300 taels of gold, committing a crime under Article 357, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. (3) Murder and arson: After the defendant was arrested, telegrams came from all parties listing the evidence, which was all confirmed. The acts of murder and arson were mostly committed by his subordinates, but the defendant, due to his position and the circumstances at the time of the review, was clearly suspected of committing a serious crime under Article 287, Paragraph 1 and Article 187, Paragraph 1. (4) Forcible seizure of people's reclaimed land: The defendant caused the Xinjiang Incident, the main cause of which was the forcible seizure of Hami King's property and forced it on his fellow villagers, committing a crime under Article 348, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The presiding judge then questioned Jin about the process of signing the New Soviet-Xinjiang Trade Agreement in great detail. Jin initially attributed the responsibility for signing the agreement to Chen Jishan, the diplomatic commissioner, repeatedly questioning him. He then said that it was signed by Chen with his consent, and later said that it was initiated by Xinjiang, and then said that it was a temporary transitional measure. The presiding judge asked why he did not report it to the central government. Jin said that the telegrams were not working. When asked why other telegrams were working, he could not give a satisfactory answer. Next, the contents of the agreement were examined. The presiding judge asked why everything that benefited the Soviet Union used "permission," while everything that benefited Xinjiang used "hope," and what legal effect "hope" had. Jin replied that there was no difference between "permission" and "hope." Then each article was examined in detail. At 5:10, the accusers Aysä, Mu Tianmin, and Mu Weixin were summoned. Aysä stated that Jin signed the agreement in order to collude with the Soviet Union so as to achieve his military ambitions. Consul Mu Weitong and Slatsky, the head of the Russian Foreign Affairs Department, took a plane from Tacheng to Dihua to sign the agreement. After the signing, Xinjiang's industry and commerce were completely controlled by the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union was able to take advantage of this to promote communization and destroy national thought. The presiding judge then specifically asked questions, and Aysä also answered in detail. There were many discrepancies with Jin's statements, especially in stating that the responsibility for signing the agreement lay with Jin and Mu Weitong and not with Chen Jishan, and his statements were particularly detailed. The presiding judge questioned Jin about his counter-accusations against Aysä for malicious prosecution, selling passports, and colluding with Russia. Aysä defended himself in court and presented counter-evidence. At 5:40, Jin Shuren was summoned again. Jin repeatedly called Aysä's testimony nonsense. The court adjourned at 6 o'clock. The trial will continue at 1 p.m. on the 17th, examining other parts and reading out today's minutes. (16th Day Central News Agency Electric)</p>

<h3>The Concrete Manifestation of the Central European Dispute</h3>
<p>——Prospects for the Consultation of Italy, Austria, and Hungary——</p>
<p>The Prime Ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary have now met in Rome. As the border conflict between Germany and Austria intensifies and the disarmament conference struggles to make progress, the situation in Central Europe becomes increasingly tense, giving the impression of being on the eve of war. Since Hitler came to power in Germany a year ago, he has been desperately using nationalism to stir up the people's historical and traditional psychology. The Stormtroopers also hold high the swastika flag to cause a sensation throughout Germany, giving the Germans, who are frequently in danger, hope for renewal. They believe that even if this method may not greatly benefit the facts, it is still hopeful compared to having no method at all. Everyone knows that the purpose of their blitzkrieg is to break through the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles, to take the opportunity to reclaim the Saar mining area in the near future, and to unite Austria and Hungary to rebuild the Third Reich in the long run. If this ideal is used properly, it may not be unhelpful to the revitalization of Germany. However, since Hitler has taken it upon himself to oppose the Soviet Union, he has brought France and the Soviet Union closer, increasing Germany's difficulties and making it more concerned about the East.</p>
<p>Italy and Germany are indeed ideologically close, as they are both countries established by Fascism. Moreover, Germany's scientific development and capitalist organization are becoming increasingly tight, and its need for overseas markets to supply raw materials and export machinery is more urgent than before the World War. Unfortunately, it is restrained by France on the European continent and bound by the British Empire at sea. It is only possible to reach an understanding with Italy. However, the fundamental nature of Italian nationalism is external aggression, taking its own country as the basis, and it lacks the quality of international cooperation in diplomacy. Therefore, the relationship between Germany and Italy is difficult to be satisfactory. Italy intends to contend for hegemony in Central Europe, and it wants to compete with France for a day's advantage, using small countries to expand its strength. However, it is also unwilling to allow Germany's free development and sit idly by and suffer its consequences. Moreover, 94% of the Austrian people are of the same race and culture as the Germans. If the merger of Germany and Austria succeeds, although it may not be enough to destroy the Treaty of Versailles in fact, its momentum is enough to shock the whole of Europe. Italy's attempt to contend for hegemony will be completely shattered. Therefore, Italy must subdue Austria and Hungary to make them its vanguard, so that Germany cannot cross the border, and even the Little Entente countries will be somewhat restrained. France will inevitably be used by Italy in the international arena. From this point of view, Italy has no way to get close to Germany.</p>
<p>On the Austrian side, it was not initially unwilling to merge with Germany. However, after the German National Socialist Party came to power, it was ignorant of the international situation and failed to observe the situation of Germany and Austria, and blindly rushed forward, which led to Austria's resentment. Considering Austria's current situation, it is surrounded by strong neighbors and is purely a continental country with no room for economic maneuver. It can only rely on Germany to provide transportation convenience and export through Hamburg via the Elbe River. If this is not possible, it can only rely on Italy to open the passage to the Adriatic Sea. Perhaps it can slightly turn around today's crisis. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini knew this, so he hinted that Italy was willing to accommodate Austria's maritime transportation. In this case, how could Austria and Hungary not move closer to Italy? Germany, realizing that this situation was unfavorable to its own country, proposed opening a canal between the Elbe River and the Danube River, using economic mutual assistance to communicate with the Little Entente countries and to dispel the resentment of Hungary and Austria. This is indeed Germany's only way out politically.</p>
<p>Commentators say that the situation in Central Europe is precarious due to the concentration of large Italian and Austrian forces on the border, and that the prospect of peace is in jeopardy and that war will inevitably break out. In fact, not to mention that Austria and Hungary are unable to wage war, even Germany is just bluffing. Its land and naval strength is less than one-eleventh of what it was before the war, and its economic strength is declining and the people's lives are difficult. How can it win the fierce battle of modern times? Therefore, today's Central European dispute is just a diplomatic war. Italy has already taken the lead, and Germany will not be left too far behind. Its active preparations should be within Italy. In the near future, this diplomatic war will inevitably become more acute and chaotic.</p>
<h3>Rome Talks in Progress, Neurath Wants to Go but Stops Again</h3>
<p>Italy, Austria, and Hungary Will Issue a Political Declaration</p>
<p>Stating They Are Not Planning to Form a Group to Resist Other Countries</p>
<p>Welcoming Germany and the Little Entente to Join Cooperation</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to today's news, German Foreign Minister Neurath's trip to Rome is still pending because Neurath still needs to consult with senior officials of the National Socialist Party again. However, many believe that Neurath's trip cannot be delayed any longer. According to government sources yesterday, it was reported that Neurath had already left Berlin. (15th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Foreign Minister Neurath today denied rumors that he would go to Rome to meet with Mussolini and that Germany is considering re-entering the League of Nations, saying that neither of these claims is true. (14th Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome Although it has been repeatedly said that the Prime Ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary will not hold political talks, it is heard that when they meet again today, they will formulate an important political declaration. It is expected that this declaration will be issued at the same time as the press release. The press release states the decision of Italy, Austria, and Hungary to work together to restore the economy of Central Europe, and the declaration states that the three countries have no intention of forming a group to harm other Central European countries, but request neighboring countries such as Germany, the Czech Republic, Yugoslavia, and Romania to cooperate with each other to seek a solution. The Italian side expressed optimism about the progress of the talks. It is heard that Italy is prepared to make major concessions on tariffs and import licenses, and Austria and Hungary will reciprocate in the same spirit. (16th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Economic Linkage Is the Main Topic</h3>
<p>Rome This afternoon, the Italian Prime Minister met again with Dollfuss and Gömbös, while experts and representatives also gathered to discuss various issues. This afternoon's meeting was the first time that the heads of the three countries have met since the tripartite meeting was convened, and the discussions lasted for three hours. It is said that the only topic is to negotiate a tripartite economic treaty or mutual treaties between the two countries so that the three countries can be linked to each other. (15th National Society Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Banquets and Receptions Are Almost Daily</h3>
<p>Rome Since the Prime Ministers of Italy, Hungary, and Austria held a tripartite meeting in Rome, no news has been announced so far, but the representatives of various countries have expressed their confidence in the good results of the meeting. In addition, banquets and receptions are still held every day during the meeting. Today, the King of Italy specially hosted a banquet for Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös. The Italian Crown Prince, senior Italian officials, and representatives and entourages of various delegations, as well as the Austrian and Hungarian ministers stationed in Rome, were all present, which can be called a grand occasion.

<h3>Army Budget Passed by the Lower House, Hore-Belisha Creates New National Defense Force</h3>
<p>Protecting the British Isles and Overseas Territories</p>
<p>Compulsory Military Service for Soldiers, Mechanization of Armaments</p>
<p>Special Attention to the Defense of Hong Kong and Singapore</p>
<p>(London) The appropriation listed in the government's 1934 army budget totals 45,375,000 pounds, of which 5,773,000 pounds are used for relief, exceeding the previous years and increasing by 1,650,000 pounds compared to the previous year. The House of Commons passed it after a simple discussion today. Duff Cooper, Financial Secretary to the War Office, explained during the discussion that the British army has four tasks: (1) to assume the protection of naval bases; (2) to protect certain borders and maintain order in certain places in India, Egypt, Sudan, etc., because Britain has special obligations in these places; (3) to protect the British Isles, because the islands are the "arsenal of the British Empire"; (4) to carry out defensive warfare at home when necessary, and to participate in wars abroad under unpredictable circumstances. (16th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Paris) The House of Commons today approved the 1934 army budget, which will be used to reform coastal defenses, continue the mechanization process, build considerable military reserve depots, improve barracks, and increase training facilities. Duff Cooper, Financial Secretary to the War Office, announced when submitting the bill the establishment of a new territorial army, the Royal National Defense Force, and said that when selecting soldiers for this new army, priority should be given to those who have served in the Territorial Army or the Regular Army. Although they are not suitable for active service, they can be used to protect important locations in emergencies. They are registered with the Territorial Association in peacetime, and serve only under honorary obligations in emergencies. In addition to regular pay, they are given a subsidy of five pounds. The aim of this new territorial army is to enable those with stronger physical strength to be placed in active service. Duff Cooper spoke of tanks, saying that they are the most terrifying weapons in the world. After 1918, tanks have been greatly improved, but no one can predict the impact of new inventions on future wars. As things stand, the invention of armor-piercing bullets is faster than the invention of bulletproof armor. In the next few years, the heaviest tanks may not be able to withstand the fire of rifles or machine guns. The army is still testing artillery that is ideal for resisting tanks, and hopes to have a final decision soon. Tanks are valuable in the Flanders region of Belgium, but may not be suitable in the northwestern province of India or in the swampy and ditchy areas near Shanghai. The Japanese previously felt that tanks and armored vehicles were obstacles to marching in Shanghai. Duff Cooper continued to say that the Singapore project will require 450,000 pounds of funding this year, saying that there must be soldiers to protect the base, and anti-aircraft guns and artillery teams also need soldiers. The Liberal Party's Acland said that the budget stipulates that only 500 pounds will be allocated for the construction of barracks in Hong Kong, which is too little. Duff Cooper replied that this amount is only allocated for those who have been investigated. As for the entire event, it will be submitted to the House of Commons again next year for detailed consideration. (15th Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Disarmament Policy</h3>
<p>New Memorandum Is Not Inflexible</p>
<p>Eden's Words Praised by German Newspapers</p>
<p>(London) Today, Sir Stanley Baldwin, Under-Secretary of State for War, stated in the House of Lords in response to the disarmament debate that if necessary, Britain will not hesitate to change its disarmament memorandum, even changing fundamental principles. Once it receives replies from various countries, the British government will quickly begin to discuss interim and permanent policies to ensure world peace. (15th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers have praised British Lord Privy Seal Eden's speech on disarmament in the House of Commons yesterday. However, some German newspapers have slightly criticized Eden's criticism of German General Göring's remarks, saying that Eden should know that he has not been asked to make this judgment and has no right to judge. (15th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Identical Italian and French Attitudes on the Disarmament Issue</h3>
<p>Allowing Germany to Increase Armaments Under Strict Supervision</p>
<p>But Not to Exceed France</p>
<p>(Paris) According to reliable sources close to the French government, Italy and France have agreed in principle to Germany's request to increase armaments. The French government has expressed its willingness to allow Germany to increase a portion of its defensive armaments, but the restrictions on offensive armaments will remain as originally agreed. It is said that the recent agreement between Italy and France also allows Germany to increase its army, but it must be subject to strict control. However, under no circumstances should all French armaments exceed those of Germany. (16th National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Germany's Military Preparations Feel Threatened, Belgium Seeks Security Guarantees</h3>
<p>Intending to Follow the Example of the Franco-Belgian Alliance</p>
<p>To Conclude a Consultation Treaty with Britain</p>
<p>Brussels After discussing foreign affairs, the Senate passed an agenda by a majority of eighty-five votes to one, stating that Germany's rearmament poses an increasing threat to Belgium and that the government should take safeguards to prevent it. According to well-informed sources, the so-called safeguards are intended to follow the example of the Franco-Belgian alliance and conclude a treaty with Britain to establish a "consultation" on national defense. If this treaty can be concluded, it will greatly benefit French security. The government seems to agree to pursue this policy, and the British government may also be aware of Belgium's intentions, but there seem to be no concrete negotiations between the two governments.

<h3>Japanese Steamships Reconnoitering Soviet Territorial Waters</h3>
<p>(Moscow) A telegram from Boly reports that on March 10, a border patrol officer saw the Japanese motor ship "Totsima Maru" (transliteration) at the entrance to Vladivostok Bay, two miles from Askolt Island. When questioned by the border authorities, the captain of the ship stated that the ship was conducting scientific work on the fisheries in the area and had to dock near the shore due to engine damage. The engine has now been repaired. The authorities carefully inspected the ship and found that it was equipped with long and short wave radio detectors. The authorities then drafted a document stating that the ship had entered Soviet territorial waters without permission and ordered the ship to leave Soviet territorial waters immediately. According to sailors, the ship is a reconnaissance ship and is clearly engaged in some kind of reconnaissance work. (15th TASS Telegraph (Moscow) Today, the Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Committee instructed the Russian Ambassador in Tokyo to contact the Japanese government, negotiate with the Manchukuo authorities to return the Russian light bomber that fell in Mishan, and release the personnel in the aircraft. The Harbin military authorities have rejected the request of the Russian Consul General, saying that the matter is currently under investigation. At the same time, the "Manchukuo Foreign Ministry" has protested to the Russian Consul General about the Russian aircraft flying into Manchukuo territory. (16th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) Japanese Ambassador to France Sato, speaking at the International Diplomatic Academy today, said that Japan is now making genuine efforts to improve its relations with Russia and that the Japanese government is doing its best to eliminate obstacles that could hinder Russian-Japanese cooperation. The widely rumored possibility of armed conflict should be eliminated. Neither Russia nor Japan wants conflict, and no one wants war. (15th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) We have received a telegram from Consul General Morishima stationed in Harbin to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reporting that Soviet Russian Consul General in Harbin Slavitsky visited this Consulate General yesterday, the 14th, and stated his request as follows: The Soviet aircraft landed in Manchuria from time to time this time because of engine failure, and there is no other meaning. Therefore, this issue should be resolved as a local incident. (16th Japanese United Press)</p>
<h3>Foreigners Spying on Fortresses in Shimonoseki, Japan</h3>
<p>A Consul of a Certain Country Is Suspected</p>
<p>Japan Temporarily Adopts a Cautious Attitude</p>
<p>According to Japanese news, the Kanmon area of Japan is very convenient for spies to infiltrate, so many spies from various countries are secretly active. The Shimonoseki Land and Sea Police Station and the Gendarmerie are on high alert. Recently, a deputy consul of a certain country and his wife were found to be suspected of spying on the fortress area. The police authorities are very concerned. The deputy consul came to Shimonoseki from Tokyo and stayed in a hotel. He secretly obtained a map of the General Staff Headquarters from Shimonoseki to a certain place in Sanin. He walked from Shimonoseki to a certain place in Sanin to investigate the terrain. His wife also used the excuse of training her pet dog to sneak into Mt. Hi and other important areas of the fortress every day to spy on the terrain and communicate secretly with her country. Because he is a consul of a major country, the Japanese authorities do not want to handle it rashly, which may cause a major international problem, and are temporarily adopting a cautious attitude.

<h3>US Navy Layoffs Rumor</h3>
<p>Is This a Prelude to a Major Reform?</p>
<p>(Washington) The reduction of officers in the US Navy Fleet and Marine Corps is now in full swing again. Today, the report of the Special Inspection Group recommends that the peacetime reduction of the Navy Fleet and Marine Corps be based on the terms of the report. Marine Corps officers will be reduced from 1,093 to 991. Officers who have reached the age of retirement are all on the list of those to be removed. However, the report also advocates that the number of Navy Fleet officers should not fall below 5,499. According to the Navy's mobilization plan, in order to achieve the effect of land contact, the current 5,499 Navy Fleet officers are still 1,318 short of the number needed to operate the country's warships. The report continued that the number of drivers on each warship must be 80% full, and this policy must continue to be maintained. The report strongly opposed other reforms of the Navy. Although the so-called other reforms were not explicitly stated, they actually implicitly referred to the merger of the US Coast Guard Fleet and the US Navy Fleet. If the merger is realized, the personnel of the Coast Guard Fleet will receive the same treatment as the Marine Corps. Since the news of the layoffs came out, the Marine Corps officers have been deeply surprised, because Marine Corps Commander Fro recently made a proposal to expand the Marine Corps based on the weakness of the Marine Corps. Fro also pointed out that the officers of the Marine Corps have served for 13 years, which is more than twice the experience of the officers of the same rank in the Navy Fleet.

<p>As a Result of the Conflict, Twenty Chinese Immigrants Were Injured</p>
<p>Manila Tonight, a serious conflict occurred between Filipinos and Chinese immigrants in the city of Manila. The entire police force was dispatched. It is rumored that many people were injured in the riots. All Chinese stores in the San Nicolas area and other areas were closed last night. After the situation stabilized today, they returned to normal. A total of twenty Chinese immigrants were injured and hospitalized.

The store clerk was very angry and planned to stab him with a knife. Then the conflict followed. No arrests or other incidents have occurred in the riot area, but the police are patrolling very strictly to prevent the expansion of the situation. (15th National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>British Businessmen Meet with Japanese Ambassador</h3>
<p>To Discuss Cotton Industry Negotiations</p>
<p>(London) The Anglo-Japanese Cotton Textile Industry Representatives Conference has broken down. Today, members of the House of Commons asked the government for their opinion on this matter. Secretary of Commerce Runciman then issued a statement as follows: "After the British delegation met with the Japanese delegation yesterday, they declared to the press that since the two sides could not obtain a basis for negotiation, they could only report the result of the conference to the government. Because this conference was initiated by the government, the British delegation therefore submitted a report to the government yesterday afternoon. We should know that this direct negotiation between representatives of the industrial and commercial circles of Britain and Japan was decided to be held after consultation between the governments of the two countries. Now that it has failed, how to proceed in the future should still be considered by the governments of the two countries. I will take appropriate measures according to the situation. I will meet with Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira sooner or later. Other than that, I cannot issue other declarations." When members raised other questions, Runciman did not answer them. Conservative Party member Lee Mer considered that the discussion should be postponed and proposed a motion to postpone the discussion of this case, which was passed by the House of Commons. (15th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) Secretary of Commerce Runciman and Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira discussed the breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese textile negotiations today for an hour. Afterwards, Runciman told Reuters reporters that we exchanged opinions and were very friendly. It is likely that the Japanese Ambassador is now contacting his government. The Secretary of Commerce declined to announce the content of the discussion. Many believe that the British government is eager to find out the Japanese government's opinion and hopes to establish a friendly agreement as soon as possible to maintain the interests of both countries.

The National League believes that Prime Minister Saito also has disciplinary problems in Incheon, Korea, regarding the sale of land, and has decided to rise up and impeach him. It is currently secretly conducting investigations and collecting materials, but those close to the Prime Minister believe that this is deliberate propaganda and that the facts are completely unfounded, so they dismiss it with a smile.

<h3>Soviet Administrative Reform</h3>
<p>Eliminating Bureaucratic Habits</p>
<p>Strengthening Individual Responsibility</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government has promulgated an order on the organizational plan of administrative and economic structure. The order aims to ensure the specific leadership of the administrative and economic work of various departments of the Soviet Union, its application to the new tasks of the reconstruction period, and the elimination of bureaucratic habits. The order sets out various specific measures for administrative personnel to strengthen the system of single management and individual responsibility for their assigned tasks. For example, in addition to the elected Soviet organs, the number of trusts in various administrative and economic tasks should be reduced, and the council system should be abolished. Each People's Committee will be presided over by one People's Commissar, and the number of its Deputy Commissars shall not exceed two. Each People's Committee shall be composed of 40 to 70 members, at least half of whom are representatives of local organs and enterprises, and it is stipulated that regular meetings shall be held once every two months.

<h3>U.S. Government Conducts In-depth Study, Silver Policy Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Washington) After a lengthy discussion with Representative Sumners today, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau issued a statement saying that after a detailed study of the silver issue, the Treasury Department deeply feels that the issue of increasing the value of silver is worthy of research. He said that the Treasury Department is constantly conducting in-depth research on the silver issue and ultimately feels that the London Silver Agreement is actually not easy to implement in terms of stabilizing the value of silver. He has always advocated openness on the silver issue. If the economic situation gradually improves, we should affirm this principle and proceed accordingly. He has always believed that the silver issue is the only way to alleviate the economic panic. Now that everything is gradually on the right track, it is even more inappropriate to change course. According to recent reports, the U.S. price index has been increasing rapidly, faster than any other country, so he firmly advocates that the government should not suddenly change its policy, and if President Roosevelt deems it necessary, he can definitely effectively implement the silver issue. He also said that recently, some people engaged in silver mining are taking advantage of the rising silver prices to engage in speculation, which is deeply concerning.</p>

<h3>Death of Dr. Black, Head of the Department of Anatomy at Peking Union Medical College</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Dr. Black, head of the Department of Anatomy at Peking Union Medical College, passed away last night at the age of forty-nine. Dr. Black was a Canadian who came to Beiping in 1919. He believed that primitive humans could be found in Asia. He accidentally discovered a human tooth at Zhoukoudian, forty miles from Beiping. Dr. Black determined that the tooth belonged to a kind of primitive human, and then began excavating. He eventually discovered the bones of ancient humans, which are now known as "Peking Man." Dr. Black did very important scientific work on this. British, American, and Chinese science magazines often published his works. Dr. Black had been ill for several months and was always worried about dying before the research on "Peking Man" was completed, so he urgently wanted to continue his research. The doctor recently allowed him to work two hours a day, but Dr. Black often did not follow his advice. He entered his office at five o'clock last night and worked at his desk as usual. When the doctor entered this morning, he had been dead for a long time. Those who heard the news lamented his death. (Special Telegram, 16th)</p>

Zhu Jiahua presided over the meeting, led the salutation, and delivered a speech, roughly stating that since Chairman Chiang initiated the New Life Movement in Jiangxi, various places have responded one after another, which proves that the New Life Movement meets the requirements of the times. He also said that the New Life Movement is suitable for Chinese history and is based on the consistent spirit of the inherent morality, propriety, righteousness, integrity, wisdom, benevolence, and courage. Everyone should start from themselves, strive to practice, and can revitalize the nation. Then Fang Juehui reported on the preparation and solicitation of initiators. Subsequently, Ye Chucang encouraged comrades to not be afraid of difficulties, to vigorously promote the New Life Movement, to find happiness in suffering, and to realize the New Life with sincerity and perseverance. Wang Zhaoming gave a speech, saying that Chiang originally advocated starting the New Life Movement in Nanjing first, but various places responded spontaneously, which shows that everyone needs to demand this movement. However, in order to prevent it from becoming propaganda of slogans and slogans, or fearing negligence in practice, the first thing to do in implementing the New Life Movement is to be honest and the second is to be scientific, using scientific methods to control life. Finally, Luo Jialun, Chu Minyi, and Wang Shijie gave speeches successively, and Wang Zhaoming and thirty-one others were elected as supervisors. (Central News Agency, 16th)</p>

<h3>Inner Mongolia Autonomous Committee Temporarily Located at Bailing Temple</h3>
<p>Mongolian Representative Talks After Returning to Beiping</p>
<p>Autonomous Region Also Defined</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The thirteen representatives of the Inner Mongolian leagues and banners who came to Beijing, including Nima Ote Sor, Guote Zhuoerzhabu, Gongchuke Lashi, Zhao Taibao, Sengge Linqin, Jierge Lang, Ayuerzhana Ayuer, Cangsen, Linqin, Bai Yincang, Gu Zhaozong, and Su Ludai, returned to Beiping by car on the morning of the 14th at 11:00 AM. This morning (14th), they separately visited Huang Fu and He Yingqin and urged He to concurrently serve as the Chief of Guidance for Inner Mongolian Autonomy. According to Nima, "Inner Mongolian autonomy has experienced many twists and turns. Through the mediation of President Wang and Chairman Jiang, eight principles were finally established, and the autonomy measures were announced, resulting in an exceptionally satisfactory outcome. The representatives are scheduled to stay in Beiping for three days. After visiting Chairman Huang and Chairman He, they will return to Bailing Temple to begin organizing the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Political Affairs Committee in accordance with the organizational outline. All members are determined not to concurrently serve as department or division chiefs. The autonomous region is currently limited to the seven tribes of the Western Four Leagues and the Three Special Banners. In the future, we still hope to include the Eastern Three Leagues. We heard in Beijing about the request from the left and right wings of Qinghai to join the Autonomous Political Affairs Committee, but the details are not very clear. After the Chahar department is reorganized into a league, the system of each league and banner will continue to follow the hereditary method without any changes." Zhao Taibao also said, "The Organic Law of the Inner Mongolian Local Autonomous Government stipulates that the Autonomous Government is located in Bailing Temple, but this is temporary. In the future, a suitable location will be selected based on national defense, economy, population, and other conditions. The representatives have drafted a budget for the expenses of the Political Affairs Committee, temporarily set at 50,000 yuan per month, which only covers administrative expenses, and does not include military expenses or construction expenses. This budget has been reported to the Executive Yuan but has not yet been approved, although there will likely be no major changes in the future. The central government intends to grant De Wang an important military position in Inner Mongolia and is currently discussing it." Guote Zhuoerzhabu also said, "My trip to Jiangxi was purely to request instructions regarding the issue of the Japanese forcibly establishing radio stations in Mongolia. Wang and Jiang both expressed that they would convene a meeting to discuss it, presided over by the central government, and would never allow the Japanese to enter Inner Mongolia by even an inch." The so-called Eastern Three Leagues in Nima's speech refer to the Jerim, Zhaowuda, and Zuosotu Leagues within Liaoning and Rehe, while the Western Four Leagues refer to the Xilingol, Ikhe Zhao, Ulanqab, and Chahar Leagues. The Three Special Banners are the Tumote, Ejina, and Alxa. (14th)</p>
<h3>Sun Ke and Kong Xiangxi Fly to Jiangxi to Meet Jiang</h3>
<p>Negotiating Constitutional and Financial Issues</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance, flew from Nanjing to Jiangxi on the 14th on a Ford aircraft, arriving in Nanchang at 12:40 PM.

After Sun and Kong disembarked, they took cars prepared by the Field Headquarters to meet Jiang at his residence. It is reported that Sun's visit is to seek Jiang's opinions on the constitution and to discuss important issues regarding silver negotiations. The draft constitution has been completed by the Legislative Yuan, and it is now time for criticism and discussion. He has come to consult on everything. Kong's visit is to discuss financial issues with Jiang, including the anti-communist military expenses and the 20 million yuan for post-communist suppression remedial and fundamental governance approved by the central government. The progress of the five-province campaign is currently very rapid. Areas recovered in eastern and western Jiangxi, as well as the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, are about to move from the remedial stage to the fundamental governance stage. Northern Fujian and other places also urgently need post-disaster relief. However, the two fees approved by the central government have been allocated very little, so it is necessary to find a way to raise funds. (15th)</p>

<h3>Wei Lihuang Requests One Month's Leave</h3>
<p>Second Phase of Communist Suppression Plan About to Be Implemented</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: In the first phase of communist suppression in northern Fujian, the four counties of Shunchang, Jiangle, Sha County, and Yong'an have been completely recovered. Now, Chen Cheng, the commander of the Northern Route Army, is leading his troops, the 3rd divisions of Fan Songfu, Guo Siyan, and Zhou Zhirou, into Fujian from Zixi and Lichuan in eastern Jiangxi, successively capturing the counties of Guangze and Shaowu, and forming a line with the Eastern Route Army. After the military authorities decided, the second phase of military operations will begin soon. Wei Lihuang, the commander of the front lines in the Eastern Route Army, is fully in charge of the anti-communist affairs in northern Fujian. Wei himself was originally scheduled to go to Yanping on the 15th to command, but on the 13th, the old pain in his right flank suddenly flared up, making it difficult to endure the hardships of travel. He temporarily requested a month's leave from the Field Headquarters to recuperate in the province. The Northern Route Army has recently made rapid military progress. The Field Headquarters received a telegram from Chen Cheng yesterday, reporting that the Fan Songfu division under his command had entered Tai Ning from Shaowu, and the communist pseudo-7th Army Corps was retreating towards Jianning. He requested that the Eastern Route Army in Jiangle be ordered to advance towards Mingxi to clear out the remaining bandits, so as to form a line with the troops in Tai Ning and then advance further. The Li Mo'an division arrived in Sha County the day before yesterday, and the Liu Kan division is still advancing towards Liancheng. It is heard that these two divisions will also join the encirclement and suppression of the bandits in Qingliu and Mingxi, so as to recover these two counties in the shortest possible time, complete the second phase of military operations, and directly attack the communist base areas of Ninghua and Changting on the Fujian border.

<h3>Hai Shun Steamer Traveling Between Fujian and Hong Kong Runs Aground</h3>
<p>More Than Two Hundred Passengers Rescued</p>
<p>Stern Flooded, Now Aground on Reef</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Hai Ning, Hai Cheng, Hai Yang, and Hai Shun steamers of the Hong Kong British firm Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. ply between Hong Kong, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou. On the 11th, the Hai Shun steamer left Xiamen from Fuzhou. At 8:00 PM, it ran aground on a reef in the Baiyouyang sea area. All 216 passengers were rescued. According to those who escaped and arrived in Xiamen, the process of the accident was roughly as follows: the Hai Shun steamer completed loading its cargo at about 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 11th, and the departure procedures were also completed. It could have departed immediately, but the captain hosted a banquet, which lasted until after 3:00 PM. Then, the wheels were turned and the steamer departed. At about 8:00 PM, it passed through the Baiyouyang sea area, which has the Changkeng Gorge, shaped like a tripod, with many hidden reefs in the middle. The navigator mistakenly took the wrong route, causing the steamer to run aground violently on the reef. At that time, the tide was high and the reef was low. Fortunately, the bow did not break through, but with a loud crash, passengers lying on the bunks or canvas beds in the cabins all rolled onto the deck. For a moment, cries, shouts for help, and the sound of the waves echoed each other, and order was lost. The captain hurriedly put the ship in reverse, but with too much force, the stern struck the reef again, piercing a hole. Seawater gurgled in, and the steamer was grounded and could not get out, and the stern was sinking. The captain began to send wireless telegraphs and launch flares for help. The Xiamen Customs patrol boat and the naval vessel that was nearby received the report and arrived first. The fishing boats also heard the flare and arrived. The passengers boarded the lifeboats, then the patrol boat, or the fishing boats. It was around midnight, with dark clouds and heavy rain. Approximately 160 people boarded the patrol boat, and the rest boarded the fishing boats. Fortunately, all 216 passengers were rescued. At 6:00 PM on the evening of the 12th, they sailed to Mawei. Those who rode the fishing boats landed in Mawei, and the patrol boat sailed directly to Fuzhou. The captain, crew, and a dozen sailors remained on the steamer. After the Hai Shun incident, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Hong Kong headquarters received a distress telegram and immediately telegraphed the Xiamen branch, instructing them to send a steamer to assist. After receiving the telegram, the Xiamen branch sent the Hai Ning, which was docked in Xiamen, to assist. The merchant steamer Jiahe, which was passing by after leaving the Hai Shun, also moored next to the Hai Shun to guard against pirates. The Jiahe only sailed to Xiamen on the evening of the 12th, when the Hai Ning arrived. It is also heard that the stern of the Hai Shun is flooded to a depth of more than 30 feet, and the engine room and power station are completely submerged. Half an hour after running aground, all the electric lights went out. Currently, only the cargo in the bow is preserved, and the stern is flooded. It is expected that it will not be easy to get the steamer out of danger after unloading. The steamer has a deadweight of approximately 2,000 tons. (March 14th)</p>
<h3>Tao Liu Love Suicide Case Supreme Court Rejects Appeal</h3>
<p>Beijing News: The sensational Tao Sijin, Xu Qinwen, Liu Mengying love suicide case, which occurred over a year ago, has concluded. After the Zhejiang High Court's retrial judgment, the prosecutor appealed, and it is now learned that the Supreme Court has ruled to reject the appeal. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Facts: Tao Sijin and Liu Mengying were both female students at the Zhejiang Art College. Initially, they shared the same dormitory, and their friendship deepened through late-night conversations. Subsequently, a romantic relationship developed. At the height of their passion, they vowed never to marry men in order to maintain their love for each other. As time passed, mutual suspicion arose. Liu Mengying noticed that Tao Sijin was unusually close to Liu Wenru, a female teacher in the drawing department of the school, and suspected that they also had a lesbian relationship. She repeatedly urged Sijin to break off relations with Liu Wenru, and threatened to kill Liu Wenru or Tao Sijin, or to reveal their love history. As a result, their relationship gradually deteriorated. Xu Qinwen was a close friend of Tao Sijin's deceased brother, Tao Yuanqing. After Yuanqing's death, Xu Qinwen, admired by Chinese and foreign figures for his paintings, raised funds to purchase land and build a house in the Lotus Pavilion area of West Lake to display his works. He also built several houses next to it for his own residence. Liu Mengying often visited Xu's residence with Tao Sijin. During winter and summer vacations, the two women would stay at Xu's place together, a fact known to his family. In the winter of the tenth year of the Republic of China, the art college was on holiday. Tao Sijin returned to her native Shaoxing, and Liu Mengying went to Shanghai to visit her sister, Liu Qingxing. Due to the outbreak of the war in Zhabei, Shanghai, Liu Mengying fled to Hangzhou on the night of February 3rd of the 21st year of the Republic of China and went directly to Xu Qinwen's residence to stay. On the 6th of the same month, Tao Sijin, upon receiving a letter from Liu Wenru informing her of her intention to return to Sichuan, also brought food from Shaoxing to Hangzhou to see her off. After meeting Liu Mengying at Xu Qinwen's residence, she stayed at the art college for two nights. On the afternoon of the 8th, she planned to return to Shaoxing, passing by Xu Qinwen's residence. Due to Liu Mengying's persuasion, she did not leave. The two women stayed together for three nights without any unusual behavior. On the 11th, Tao Sijin again wanted to return home, but was persuaded by Liu Mengying to stay. In the afternoon, Xu Qinwen took his girlfriend, Guo Dehui, to the Jianggan Beixian Bridge school to cover for his sister. Only Liu Mengying, Tao Sijin, and the maid Chen Zhugu were at home. Liu Mengying asked Chen Zhugu to heat water for her bath. Because she needed snow cream, she and Tao Sijin asked Chen Zhugu to go out and buy it. Tao Sijin gave Chen Zhugu six jiao (dimes). After Chen Zhugu left, Tao Sijin bolted the front door and read the newspaper in the bedroom. After her bath, Liu Mengying again questioned Tao Sijin, asking if she had come to Hangzhou to see Liu Wenru. She also said that if she did not change her ways, a tragedy would surely occur. Tao Sijin told her not to be so stubborn. She then went to the outer room of the bathroom to fetch an electric stove to boil tea. Liu Mengying followed her, nagging incessantly. Tao Sijin, in a moment of anger, was overcome by homicidal intent. She ran to the kitchen next door, grabbed a kitchen knife, and slashed at Liu Mengying. Liu Mengying also grabbed a wooden stick to defend herself. They fought around the showroom, blood splattering everywhere. Liu Mengying, wounded, dropped the stick and ran to the front door, trying to open it and escape, but was caught up by Tao Sijin, who knocked her to the ground and cut her trachea, causing her immediate death. Tao also fainted on the ground. Chen Zhugu and another friend, Qiu Benyuan, returned and called at the door without response. Shortly after, Xu Qinwen and his sister, Xu Xianye, also arrived, but were still unable to enter. They walked along the river to the back door, forced it open, and entered, finding Liu Mengying murdered on the ground, and Tao Sijin also lying there. They immediately opened the door, called the police, and reported to the local police station, which reported to the prosecutor of the Hangzhou County District Court, who examined the corpse and injuries, and initiated an investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Reasons: After reviewing the files, it is clear that the victim, Liu Mengying, died from being murdered, as verified by the prosecutor in the first instance, who filled out a post-mortem examination report attached to the file. The defendant, Tao Sijin, does not deny killing Liu Mengying. Their relationship began as a lesbian love affair, which then became fraught with mutual suspicion, and ultimately resulted in a conflict due to Liu Mengying's insistence that she break off relations with Liu Wenru, leading to the stabbing death. The cause of the conflict and the circumstances of the crime have been confessed by the defendant without reservation. Furthermore, there are the diaries of the two individuals and letters from Liu Mengying to Tao Sijin that can be consulted as evidence, making the facts extremely clear. The grounds for the appeal, concerning Tao Sijin's murder, state that after reviewing the statements of Xu Qinwen, Tao Sijin, and Chen Zhugu (i.e., Chen Zhugu), the lesbian relationship between Tao Sijin and Liu Mengying had long been fractured, leading to mutual attacks and infighting. The cause of the fracture was that Liu Mengying viewed Liu Wenru as a rival, and Tao Sijin also suspected Liu Mengying of having an affair with Xu Qinwen. When Xu Qinwen refused Tao's request to come to Hangzhou but allowed Liu Mengying to stay at his home, it was seen by Tao Sijin, who left in resentment. The motive for the murder was latent in this. Tao Sijin returned to Xu's residence on February 8th, repeatedly inviting Liu Mengying to go to Shaoxing, but Liu refused, and Tao also did not leave. On the afternoon of the 11th, Tao saw Xu Qinwen take Ms. Guo to Huaxian Bridge, believing that there was an opportunity to take advantage of. She then ordered Chen Zhugu to go to Qixia to buy snow cream, closing and bolting the door to prevent outsiders from entering. All of this is enough to determine that Tao Sijin's killing of Liu Mengying was premeditated. As for Tao Sijin's claim that Liu Mengying, after taking a bath, went outside and asked if she had come to Hangzhou to see Liu Wenru, this was the tone of the initial questioning. How could she not even put on her coat and shoes, and follow her to the tea room, nagging incessantly, and standing motionless, allowing her to grab a knife and kill her? It is also sufficient to show that when Liu Mengying was bathing, Tao Sijin was already holding a knife, waiting outside the bathroom, and as soon as she came out, she attacked her with the knife. The premeditation is very clear. This court believes that the facts of the crime should be determined based on evidence, and it is not appropriate to base the judgment on speculation. Although the relationship between Tao Sijin and Liu Mengying gradually deteriorated after mutual suspicion arose, judging from Tao Sijin's repeated statements, Xu Qinwen and Liu Mengying did not have any relationship. Therefore, Liu Mengying's stay at Xu Qinwen's home was not noticed by Tao Sijin. Furthermore, Xu Qinwen did not know that Liu Mengying had come to Hangzhou in advance. His letter preventing Tao Sijin from coming was before Liu Mengying's arrival, so there was no issue of welcoming or rejecting her. The grounds for the appeal, stating that Tao Sijin's motive for murder was latent in this, are clearly inconsistent with the facts. As for Liu Mengying's suspicion that Tao Sijin had a lesbian relationship with the female teacher Liu Wenru, viewing her as a rival, as evidenced by Tao Sijin's diary of October 12th of the 20th year, and Liu Mengying's angry words on a postcard to Tao Sijin in Shanghai, her emotions were on the verge of collapse, which can be proven. However, after examining the statements of Chen Zhugu, Qiu Benyuan, and Xu Qinwen in the first and second trials, they all stated that when Tao Sijin first arrived at the house, she sat and talked for a short time, then took a basket to stay at the art college. She returned to their home on February 8th, originally intending to return home, but did not do so due to Liu Mengying's persuasion. On the 11th of the same month, she again wanted to return home, but stopped because Liu Mengying persuaded her to stay. Therefore, Tao Sijin's delayed departure was due to Liu Mengying's earnest retention, so how could it be said that her failure to leave was because she had the intention to murder when the opportunity arose? Moreover, according to what Chen Zhugu and Qiu Benyuan said, Tao Sijin stayed at Xu Qinwen's house for three nights, talking and laughing as usual, without any quarrels. Sometimes they went to the market together, and returned together, without seeing anything else unusual. This observation is also very different from the behavior of someone who is plotting murder. As for Liu Mengying asking the maid Zhugu to buy snow cream before taking a bath because it had run out, according to Chen Zhugu, Tao and Liu were together at the time, so it cannot be presumed that Tao Sijin intentionally made her leave. As Chen Zhugu's trip to the Qixia market was because there were no good products to buy near Zhaoqing Temple, it was not Tao Sijin's intention to go there. Closing the door when going out was the usual habit of the Xu residence, as Xu Qinwen also stated clearly without any difference. It is also difficult to recognize that Tao Sijin was preventing others from entering in order to achieve her purpose of killing. As for the location of the murder, according to the first trial's map, the bloodstains began near the door inside the corridor. If, as the grounds for appeal stated, Tao Sijin was already holding a knife, waiting outside the bathroom, and could not do so because the door was closed, then as soon as Liu Mengying came out after taking a bath, she attacked her with the knife, the bloodstains should have started outside the bathroom door. How could she wait for her to walk near the corridor before raising the knife towards her? Therefore, Tao Sijin's statement that Liu Mengying returned to the bedroom after taking a bath, and asked her again if she had come to see Liu Wenru, arguing with each other, and that she went to the outside of the bathroom to fetch an electric stove to boil tea, and Liu followed her again, nagging incessantly, leading to a conflict, using a knife to kill her, is still credible. In summary, there is no evidence in the whole file that Tao Sijin premeditated the murder. The original trial recognized that her intention to kill arose temporarily, and punished her according to Article 282, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Also, because the crime occurred before March 5th of the 21st year of the Republic of China, according to Article 2 of the Amnesty Act, the sentence was reduced by one-third, sentencing her to life imprisonment, and proclaiming lifelong deprivation of public rights in accordance with Article 292 of the Criminal Law. The facts and the law are properly applied, without any impropriety. The grounds for appeal are purely based on speculation and are difficult to justify. As for Xu Qinwen's part in the seduction, according to the survey form of the art college, although the victim Liu Mengying was still under the age of 20, her stays at Xu Qinwen's home were not denied by the defendant. However, Article 257 of the Criminal Law states that the crime of seduction requires the person seduced to leave the custody of the person with parental rights, guardian, or curator, but the offender must have the intention and act of abduction, or transfer the person seduced under his own control, with a purpose of achieving a private gain, to be able to establish the crime. After reviewing the files, Liu Mengying often stayed at Xu Qinwen's house with Tao Sijin during school holidays, purely out of her own volition, and was not summoned by Xu Qinwen. On February 3rd of the 21st year of the Republic of China, when Liu Mengying fled from Shanghai to Hangzhou, she went directly to his residence, which was also unknown to Xu Qinwen in advance. Regardless of whether his family knew the location of her whereabouts, it is clear that Xu Qinwen had the intention and act of abduction, and it cannot be clearly pointed out that he had any private gain. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements for establishing the crime of seduction. The original trial proclaimed Xu Qinwen innocent, without any inappropriateness. The grounds for the appeal, stating that Xu Qinwen continuously seduced a woman under the age of 20 to leave the supervision and protection of the person exercising her parental rights, and criticizing the original judgment as improper, are also difficult to recognize as justified. Based on the above conclusions, the judgment should be made according to Article 408, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, as the main text.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Tragic Death of a Man Who Did Not Work</p>
<p>In Wuku Township, under the jurisdiction of the county, there was a man named Wu A'gen, whose elder brother, Xiulong, was in the fruit business. A'gen was adopted by his aunt's husband, Guo Fuxiu, at a young age. He was addicted to pleasure and did not work. In recent years, he had mortgaged and sold almost all of his own property. After being adopted, he changed his name to Guo Dimei. Recently, after his family property was exhausted, he pawned his house to Xie Shutang. Guo went to Xie's house on the 26th day of the tenth lunar month of last year to borrow 500 wen (cash), a custom known as "adding charcoal." However, Xie's wife, Peng, refused. Guo Dimei played a prank, lying down in Xie's kitchen. Peng waited until he was asleep, secretly summoned four people, and, carrying iron towers and hoes, severely beat Guo's head, causing serious injuries to the back of his head. He died immediately. They then used a flour sack to hold stones and tied it to Guo's body, sinking it in the Yaojing Bridge (i.e., the 30th Foreign Bridge) River. It was not until the other day that his brother, Xiulong, was informed and went with a friend to investigate and report to the Tenth Tu Dibao, who reported to the Prosecutor's Office. Yesterday, Inspector Wang was dispatched to the countryside to examine the body. Guo's body was lifted, although not rotten, it was swollen like a water buffalo. After receiving the report, the court, based on Xie Peng's confession, immediately summoned Xie Peng for interrogation. The other perpetrators have fled without a trace.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Fifth District Office of Hengjing Burned Down</p>
<p>The Fifth District Office of Hengjing Town, whose buildings were recently purchased, consisting of four courtyards, was unfortunately burned down on the evening of the 15th. A district clerk, Rong Sheng, was adding oil to a kerosene lamp when he was careless, causing a fire. The first three courtyards, with nine large rooms, were completely destroyed. All files were placed in the fourth courtyard, which was fortunately preserved. Another district clerk, Zhang Deshun, bravely rescued the telephone when the fire was raging, causing burns to his arm. The district chief, Kong Xian'gao, has reported the disaster to the county government for record.</p>
<h3>Scattered Bandits Discovered on the Suzhou-Wuxi Canal</h3>
<p>The Suzhou-Wuxi Canal is an important waterway in Jiangnan. Ferries travel back and forth like weaving. Recently, scattered bandits have been discovered in Wangting and other places along the canal, making travel very dangerous. The Suzhou-Wuxi Water and Land Public Security Bureau, in order to maintain water security, has dispatched a police team from the land public security forces to patrol along the road. On the water public security side, six patrol boats from the water public security district have set out to cruise in order to prevent any accidents.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Director of the Provincial Office Comes to Wuxi to Supervise the Account Inspection</p>
<p>Zhao Dihua, Director of the Finance Department of Jiangsu Province, believes that there are many abuses in the collection of land taxes in various counties. Recently, a case of embezzlement of more than 40,000 yuan occurred in Liyang County. If personnel are not sent to investigate and verify the accounts, it will not be enough to eliminate this abuse. Yesterday, this county delegated Wu Gengyu to come to Wuxi to supervise the account inspection, going directly to the county government to meet County Magistrate Yan and inquire about the current situation of land taxes. County Magistrate Yan immediately accompanied the land tax director, Zhu Kaiguan, and the second section chief, Fei Yunnong, to the Yigui cash collection counter and the account book office to inspect in detail. In addition to the already pardoned incomplete accounts, from the 4th to the 15th year of the Republic of China, which have been calculated by the staff of the account book office by year and night, the remaining current accounts from the 16th to the 22nd year are audited by Director Wu and his assistants, who personally audit them in the account book room to see if there is any embezzlement. Once the accounts are inspected, they will be listed and reported to the Provincial Finance Department for review. During the account inspection period, villagers who go to pay land price tax will be issued a small ticket.</p>
<h3>A Live Drama of Replacing the Branch Director</h3>
<p>After the former director of the Second Public Security Bureau, Wang Xiezhong, was dismissed for losing firearms, the county magistrate transferred Fan, the former director of the Fourth Bureau, to fill the position. After Fan took office, he reorganized the police affairs, and public opinion was pleased. However, in less than half a month, the Civil Affairs Department suddenly appointed Liu Zhuomin, a man from Hunan, to come to Wuxi to take over. Having been in office for five months, he has been repeatedly accused, and after investigation by the County Public Security Bureau, he was dismissed. The vacant position was transferred to Gao Chongshan, the original director of the First Bureau. Liu, unwilling to obey the order, took the seal and all important documents to the province to appeal, leaving only his wife, Li, to stay in the bureau. When the new Director Gao and Zhang Yu, the Inspector of the Public Security Bureau, arrived at the bureau to take office, Liu's wife, Li Rongzhen, refused to hand over, and even slammed the table and scolded. Gao was helpless and went to the county government to ask County Magistrate Yan for instructions. County Magistrate Yan believed that Liu had already gone to the town, and the affairs of the Second Bureau were extremely important, so he ordered Director Gao to start working first. If Liu's wife made any more trouble, she would be sent to the county court for strict legal action. It is said that Liu's wife, Li Rongzhen, is a sister to the concubine of Gu, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, so she is fearless and shows great female power.</p>
<h3>The Tooth Tax Director Has Not Completed the Handover</h3>
<p>Jia Yu, the director of the Wuxi Tooth Tax Collection Office, resigned after being approved by the Provincial Education Funding Management Office because the tax revenue was not prosperous and the handling of affairs was difficult. The tooth tax collection matters will still be handled by the county government, and a commission has been appointed to come to Wuxi to supervise the handover. However, Jia Yu had already left his post, and the accountants He Shuzhai and Sun Shihe came forward to negotiate. It is estimated that the tax revenue has been exhausted, and there are more than a hundred households that have received tooth taxes but have not yet filled out the certificates, and the amount of tax owed is also not small. He Shuzhai and Sun Shihe were sent to the county jail for custody. On one hand, the county telegraphed the provincial management office, urging them to send personnel to Rugao to guarantee that Jia Yu would come to Wuxi to clean up the account, in order to value the tax money.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Investigating the Actual Situation of the Cotton Area in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>Zou Bingwen and Sun Enlin, members of the National Economic Council and the Cotton Industry Control Committee, came to Nantong and went to Dongtai, Rugao, Yancheng, Funing, and Haimen counties to investigate the actual situation of the cotton area. Wang Zhihong, the head of the provincial-level Langshan Cotton Experiment Site, was ordered by the Construction Department to accompany the investigation.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>The Biological Mother Poisoned Two Daughters</p>
<p>Gao Jieren, of the Xijia Fence in Nantai Street, once served as the chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, he married a Guangdong merchant's maid, Chen, in Shanghai as his third concubine. At first, they were very harmonious, and had two daughters. The eldest daughter, He, was seven years old, and the youngest daughter, Ming, was five years old. Recently, Chen lost Gao's favor for some reason, so their relationship deteriorated and they often quarreled. On the 15th, Chen suddenly said that she would commit suicide to trouble Gao. Gao feared that an accident would happen, and had the door of her bedroom removed. Chen became even more angry, saying that Gao maliciously wanted to freeze her to death. Gao then had the door reinstalled. However, Chen had already prepared opium ashes and green vitriol. At about 10 o'clock, she first tricked her two biological daughters into swallowing it, and then she also ate it herself. The maid, Wang Ma, saw the situation from outside the door and rushed to tell Gao. Gao quickly hired doctors Xu Pingdu and Geng Shiting to examine them. They were diagnosed as having been poisoned and were immediately treated separately. The youngest daughter died of poisoning at about one o'clock. The eldest daughter died at seven o'clock on the morning of the 16th. Chen has been rescued and is now calm and there is no danger to her life, but she still refuses to eat. At the beginning of the incident, Gao reported to the County Public Security Bureau, which reported to the County Government. Xue Bingyang, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Chen Youmin, Secretary of the County Government, and Shao Ling, the trial judge, went to investigate that night. The Gao family is now preparing coffins and is formally requesting an autopsy.</p>

The contract is signed by both parties and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau. A draft agreement has been prepared and will be submitted to the office for approval. Twenty long distance transport vehicles have been purchased, and they will be delivered around the end of the fourth month. The implementation period is about the end of April. If the Nanjing-Wuhu line is successful, the Shengju and Suzhou-Jiading lines will continue to be implemented.</p>

<p>Thirty Inmates Escorted to Nanjing for Reform</p>
<p>All sorts of dark happenings and the establishment of "dragon heads" in county jails in Chengba have come to the attention of Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Nanchang Provisional Headquarters, and he has ordered Chairman Chen of Jiangsu Province to investigate and deal with them. The provincial government had previously sent a letter to the High Court, dispatching Wang Decheng, a judge from the Wujin County Court, to Chengba to investigate. The inmate Shen Jinsheng identified Zhao Desheng and others as the "dragon heads." Judge Wang has returned to Wujin to report. The provincial government has reported in detail to Chairman Chiang. In addition to severely punishing the main "dragon heads," 30 criminals, because of prison overcrowding, will be transferred to the Nanjing First Prison for reform. They will be escorted to Nanjing within a few days.</p>

<p>An Elderly Woman Was Robbed and Severely Injured</p>
<p>In Qingzhen Township, in the 11th District of the county, there was an elderly woman in her seventies, surnamed Sheng, who lived with her niece, who was more than ten years old. The woman was quite diligent and had some savings, which were coveted by bandits. The other night, four bandits, each carrying firearms, suddenly came to the house and searched extensively. Because they did not find much, the bandits burned the woman's body to force her to reveal where she had hidden the silver. As a result, they robbed more than a stone of white rice, jewelry, silver dollars, etc., worth about 100 yuan. The woman's injuries are quite severe, and her life may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Mishap Involving the American Consul's Car Has Been Resolved</p>
<p>Mugai, the American Consul in Shanghai, drove a small chartered car, Shanghai No. 2124, on the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway on the afternoon of the 13th of the month. Near the Caojing station, he ran over and killed Mao Xiaolong, a salt worker from Ningxian County. The Road Bureau impounded the offending car and licenses, and submitted them to the Provincial Government for transfer to the Soviet Government for negotiations. Yu Qiaqing and others, compatriots from Shanghai, Ningbo, also telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting a reasoned negotiation. As a result of the negotiations, the case has been resolved. Based on the deceased's age (54 years), he was calculated to live to 70 years old, and 30 yuan will be given each month for a total of 16 years, paid by the American Consul. The family of the deceased has received 5,000 yuan. The remaining amount will be paid off within a few days. As for the vehicle violations, the Shanghai Public Works Bureau will be notified to investigate and deal with them.</p>

<p>The Police and Regiment Conflict Has Been Resolved</p>
<p>Regarding the police and regiment conflict in Hongjiatan Town, it is now learned that Shen Jianqing, the standing committee member of the Eighth District Branch of the town, was humiliated for no reason while on duty. He was unwilling to accept it, and appealed to the county party headquarters. The county party headquarters dispatched Wang Weichu, a candidate executive committee member and head of the Third District, to the scene of the incident to investigate the truth and visit Wang Deqing, the captain of the Seventh Water Police Team, to describe the situation. Wang Deqing was furious, believing that Inspector Wang Zongtai should not have protected the police, causing the incident, and should not have illegally arrested the district branch committee member. He ordered the inspector and the policeman Yang Debiao to be dismissed together.</p>

<h3>Government Representative</h3>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association received a telegram from the Central Executive Committee of the National Government and the Executive Yuan yesterday morning stating that the Central Government and the Executive Yuan would send Secretary-General Chu Minyi to participate, and the National Government would send Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city to participate as a representative.

<h3>Sun Tonggang Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Talks About the Aims and Progress of the Aviation Society</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that young aviator Sun Tonggang arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Beijing to attend the naming ceremony of the "Tianchu" aircraft and to accept the "Yuehui" trainer aircraft presented by Du Yuesheng. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Mr. Sun at his residence. According to him, the Aviation Society can be established in Shanghai as soon as government approval is obtained. He is willing to stay here to assist and serve as an instructor. The purpose of the Aviation Society is to promote aviation education so that all men, women, and children in the country have the opportunity to try flying, and young aspirants have a place to learn. In recent years, although the domestic aviation industry has been vigorously promoted, civil aviation, due to business considerations, cannot provide the general public with widespread opportunities to try flying. Military aviation, also due to military considerations, cannot take this into account. Therefore, it is the most effective strategy for the people to organize themselves for preliminary flight training. All countries in Europe and the United States have widely adopted this approach. After accepting the "Yuehui" aircraft presented by Du Yuesheng, he will also take to the skies to participate in the performance. It is also heard that all members of the Heng Society in this city, in order to encourage Sun's martial spirit, will present him with a large silver cup as a souvenir.</p>
<h3>Notice of Participation</h3>
<p>The China Aviation Association issued a notice yesterday stating that the assembly of the "Tianchu" fighter aircraft has been completed and that the naming ceremony will be held at the Hongqiao Airport at 2:00 PM on March 18th. The "Tianchu Deputy" trainer aircraft will be presented to the Shanghai Aviation Society of the Aviation Association, and Mr. Du Yuesheng's purchased "Yuehui" trainer aircraft will be presented to Comrade Sun Tonggang. At the same time, a ceremony of acceptance will be held. All agencies, organizations, team leaders, team members, and members of this city are kindly requested to participate enthusiastically. Regarding admission tickets, in addition to being sent out, please go to the association at No. 9, Lane 177, Luban Road, French Concession, or the recruiting office on the third floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA before 11:00 AM on March 18th.</p>

After the Shanghai Aviation Society is established, it will be successively held in Nanjing, Hankou and other places to achieve the effect of universal development of aviation education. Flight Du estimates that the first phase of students can complete preliminary flight training in six months.

<p>Chinese Committee Member Li Shizeng Hosted a Visit Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Maurette, Deputy Director-General of the International Labour Office, came to China on the Italian postal ship Conte Verde from Europe to investigate the cultures and labour situation in the Far East. The ship arrived in Hong Kong at the beginning of the month, and Mr. Maurette went to Guangzhou to investigate the labour situation and cultural matters. Therefore, it was not until about 7:00 AM yesterday morning that he changed to another ship to arrive in Shanghai. Important figures from the cultural and academic circles of this city all went to the pier to greet him. After Mr. Maurette landed, he rested briefly at the hotel and was then personally led by Chinese Committee Member Li Shizeng to visit various cultural and academic institutions in this city. At 7:00 PM last night, Chinese Committee Members Li Shizeng and Wu Zhihui, and Cheng Hexian, the host of the Sino-European Cultural Advancement Association, held a banquet for Mr. Maurette at the World Society on Foch Road in the French Concession.

<h3>Tan Zhen Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Overseas Inspection Must Be After the End of April</p>
<p>Tan Zhen, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, left Beijing the night before last with his secretary and arrived in port at about 7:00 AM yesterday. After getting off the train, he returned to his residence on Huanlong Road. At 4:00 PM, he visited Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Tan at his residence but did not meet him. According to those around Tan, Mr. Tan's trip to Europe to inspect the judiciary must be made after the end of April. Moreover, before going abroad, he plans to return to his ancestral home in Qixian, Henan. Therefore, all preparations are still in progress. As for where he will visit in the future, he will first go to France, and then to England, Italy, Germany, and other countries. The central government allocated 50,000 yuan for travel expenses. Due to language differences, it is estimated that four secretaries who are good at foreign languages will accompany him, and no one else will go with him. The length of the inspection must be decided temporarily after arriving abroad, but it will not exceed one year at most. It is not possible to predict this at this time.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaohong Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

Zhao Weimin, the secretary-general appointed by the central government, and Deng Zuyin, Tang Demin, Zhan Shaohuan, Chen Meian, Fang Zhongzheng, Xie Dongshan, Zhu Wanlin, and other members of the Fujian Provincial Party Affairs Design Committee also came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and immediately paid their respects to Mr. Chen. At about 2:00 PM, they boarded the Jardine's Jebsen liner to Fujian. The ship then set sail from Shanghai at about 3:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>American Merchants Need Tungsten Ore</h3>
<p>Entrusted the International Trade Bureau to Introduce</p>
<p>The export situation of tungsten ore has gradually declined in recent years. American Aserf Metal Products Company, etc., need a large amount of tungsten powder and crushed tungsten. Due to the recent reduction in transportation, they specially wrote to the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry to introduce them. After receiving the letter, the bureau immediately notified tungsten merchants to list prices according to type for contact. Tungsten ore is produced in Chongyi, Dageng, Nankang, Shangyou in Jiangxi, and Zixing, Rucheng, Yizhang, Binxian in Hunan, etc. Due to banditry in Jiangxi Province in recent years, the output has decreased, only reaching about 6,000 tons per year. As for the export quantity, in 1932, 5,525 piculs were shipped from Shanghai to Germany, 2,357 piculs to the United Kingdom, 24,200 piculs to Hong Kong, 1,677 piculs to Italy, 420 piculs to France, and 155 piculs to Singapore and other places. But since 1932, the export quantity has been far less than before and is too small to be investigated for a while.</p>
<h3>Italian Loan Guarantee Securities Postponed</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Continues to Pay Off Loans as Usual</p>
<p>After sixteen major banks in this city undertook the 44 million large loan from the Ministry of Finance guaranteed by the Italian Boxer Indemnity, they negotiated with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to issue company-type securities with a value of 30 million yuan, guaranteed by the Italian Boxer Indemnity pledged by the Ministry of Finance. In addition, a syndicate jointly formed by the Ministry of Finance and the banks and the sixteen major banks will provide joint and several guarantees. A special office has been set up on the third floor of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Zeng Rongfu, the advisor to the Ministry of Finance, has been hired as the Secretary-General. All progress procedures have been planned and finalized. The issuance, originally scheduled for April 1st, has been decided to be changed to April 15th. According to reliable sources, this type of security is a novelty in our country, so the progress procedures must be extremely cautious. The issuance regulations have not yet been approved by the Legislative Yuan, so the issuance has to be postponed. As for the 44 million yuan that the Ministry of Finance borrowed from the banks, which was originally scheduled to be paid off in four months, the banks are still paying off on schedule.</p>
<h3>Financial Circles Discuss the Shanghai Commercial Crisis</h3>
<p>Money Shops Reduce Dealings</p>
<p>All Industries Face More Difficult Turnover</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the vitality of Shanghai's commercial sector has been depleted and difficult to recover in a short period of time. For more than two years, most shops have been operating miserably and barely maintaining the overall situation. However, with the surge of new banks established last year, in order to expand their business, lending has been slightly relaxed, which has allowed various businesses to rely on turnover and barely manage to support the remaining market. Unexpectedly, this year, at the beginning of the lunar year, the financial sector, affected by last year's business, has seen many who have declared liquidation. Even those who are still operating normally, seeing the sluggish market and lack of vitality, are bound to be mutually vigilant and strictly review lending. According to insiders in the industry, the practices of</p>
<p>money shops of opening current accounts with various shops, regardless of new or old, will be strictly rectified this year. Therefore, around the Lantern Festival this time, the number of current account openings has dropped sharply by two-thirds (for example, each shop had 600 accounts last year, but this year only 200 have been opened, and for shops with thousands, only 300 have been opened). Therefore, shops with slightly inferior reputations find it more difficult to turn over. Since there are no other ways to use funds, those who have no choice but to declare liquidation are numerous. However, there are also several large shops that are related to the overall situation that want to liquidate but cannot support themselves, resulting in rent arrears of more than ten months. The courts, in order to protect the overall situation of the city, are unwilling to comply with the creditors' requests to issue seals, and there are even more of these. If this continues, according to our observations in the financial sector, the silk cocoon season next month will be ignored, and the overall situation in Shanghai will be in imminent danger.</p>

<h3>Our Country's Trade with France</h3>
<p>Can Still Maintain a Trade Surplus</p>
<p>Our country's trade with France has always been advantageous. This is because France exports mainly luxury goods, but in recent years, due to economic collapse and weak purchasing power, sales have been quite narrow. Our country's exports, on the other hand, are mainly agricultural products and minerals, so we can still maintain a trade surplus, which is the most glorious event in our country's foreign trade. However, because merchants do not know how to improve, trade is becoming increasingly bleak. A reporter from the Dagong News Agency learned about the trade situation between our country and France from relevant parties yesterday, which is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Trade Situation with France</h3>
<p>Trade between France and China has never been very developed. The reason is that the rural economy has been bankrupt for many years and purchasing power is weak. Therefore, French goods exported to China, such as cosmetics and other luxury goods, are only patronized by women in cities, resulting in the value of imported goods declining day by day. Our country's goods exported to France, on the other hand, are mainly agricultural products and minerals, which are necessary items for French industry. Other items have decreased compared to before because merchants do not know how to improve. There are many basic raw materials for industry in the country, and France has repeatedly investigated our country's authorities. Our country is indeed vast and rich in resources, but unfortunately no one pays attention to it, so it has not been able to be sold abroad.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Trade in the Last Two Years</h3>
<p>The total value of French goods transported to China in 1932 was 99,262,000 francs. The total value in 1933 was 134,159,000 francs. The total value of our country's exports was 209,891,000 francs. The total value in 1933 was 244,820,000 francs. Comparing the total value of imports and exports in the past two years, our country's trade surplus in 1932 was 110,629,000 francs. The trade surplus in 1933 was 114,661,000 francs.</p>
<h3>Major Import and Export Items</h3>
<p>French exports to China are mostly metal products, accounting for 35% of the total value. The next is steel plate, estimated at 15%. The next is paint, accounting for 7%. Chemicals and wool each account for 3%. Our country's exports to France are mostly agricultural seeds, accounting for 40% of the total value. Peanuts are next, accounting for 13%. Other rattan ware accounts for 4%. Chinese tea accounts for only 1.5%.</p>
<h3>France Levies Import Tax on Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>Our country's foreign trade has always been dominated by silk and tea. The value of Chinese tea exported to France is quite large. In recent years, due to a lack of improvement in planting and poor packaging, the color, aroma, and taste have been slightly worse than before. Also, due to the dumping of foreign tea, the export of Chinese tea to France has fallen sharply recently. Last year, the value of Chinese tea transported to France was only more than 3 million francs. Recently, reports have stated that the French government plans to levy an import tax on Chinese tea. However, according to the French Commercial Counselor in Shanghai, he has not yet received the relevant</p>
<p>order from his country. The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry also denies this news.</p>
<h3>Banking Sector Explains That the Total Amount of Silver Does Not Include Silver Coins</h3>
<p>150 Million Taels Refers Specifically to Silver Bars and Sycee</p>
<p>Silver Coins Have Many Varieties and There Are No Statistics on Circulation</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that since Japanese bankers in the city previously announced that the total amount of silver in the country was 150 million taels, it has caused a misunderstanding among the general public. In fact, since it is referred to as a certain number of taels, it only refers to the sycee and large bars used to mint silver coins. Silver coins that have already been minted and silver jewelry are not included. As for the number of silver coins, there are many varieties, both new and old, making it difficult to accurately count them, so they are not listed. If it is said that foreign banks hold two-thirds of the silver, it is because silver dollars and pure silver have different purities. Storing silver bars or sycee is more cost-effective than storing silver dollars, and it does not mean that foreign banks intend to manipulate the banks. The facts are stated as follows:</p>
<p>Fearing Misunderstandings, a senior figure in the banking sector made a statement to the visiting reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday, saying that the total amount of 150 million taels of silver is indeed accurate. However, after reading it, the general public without knowledge can easily misunderstand or mistakenly believe that the number includes silver coins, which may cause adverse effects on society. Therefore, it is specifically stated that the number does not include silver dollars, and even jewelry is not included. It refers specifically to the sycee or silver bars stored. Therefore, the words "taels" in the number are the most obvious, because silver dollars, etc., should not be referred to as taels. As for the silver stored by foreign banks, which accounts for two-thirds of the total, it is because silver dollars and pure silver silver bars and sycee have different purities. Storing silver bars or sycee is more cost-effective than storing silver dollars, and it does not mean that foreign banks store more silver in order to manipulate the silver market. Even if they want to manipulate it, it is impossible to be fully prepared. The banknotes issued by Chinese banks all have sufficient reserves, and must be investigated by the government and deemed suitable. The detailed number is reported in detail by each bank every week, and can be publicly investigated by anyone. The amount stored this week is about 319,990,000 yuan. As for the statistics of silver coins in the country, there is no way to find out. There are many types of silver coins. Those currently circulating on the market include Qing coins, common dragon dollars, Yuan coins, Sun Yat-sen founding commemorative coins, base coins (commonly known as foreign coins), Spanish coins (commonly known as standing figure foreign coins), and the new Sun Yat-sen image silver coins minted by the mint. There are many types, and they are scattered and difficult to trace in various places. Therefore, it is impossible to statistically calculate the details. The rumors of a total of 300 million are also unreliable.</p>
<h3>Fourteen Organizations Prepare to Host a Banquet for Yan Huiqing</h3>

<h3>Memorial to the Loyal Souls and Unknown Heroes Who Died in the Shanghai Battle to Be Constructed</h3>
<p>Funding Portion Already Fully Raised</p>
<p>The Design of the Mausoleum Is Extremely Tragic and Grand</p>
<p>Construction to Commence after Approval and Be Completed in Six Months</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident two years ago, our troops fought bitterly for more than thirty days. The villages around Miaohang in the Shanghai-Songhu area were completely destroyed under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns, and the soldiers died in heaps. This battle record is truly the most glorious manifestation of the national spirit. Considering that most of the soldiers and volunteer civilians who were crushed to pieces at that time died without their names being known, leaving only desolate mounds, various sectors of this city, could not bear to see these many unknown heroes fade into obscurity. Therefore, they decided to build a Tomb of Unknown Heroes and launched a fundraising campaign to comfort the loyal souls and to perpetuate their memory for eternity.</p>
<h3>Design Completed, Solemn and Grand</h3>
<p>The tomb was designed by the architectural advisor of the municipal government, Dong Dayou. According to Mr. Dong's statement to the Shen Shi News reporter yesterday, all aspects of the tomb site design have been completed. The tomb site is located in Miaohang Town, where the Shanghai battle's artillery fire was most intense and sacrifices were greatest, covering an area of approximately thirty acres. The entire tomb area is shaped like a sword, including a tomb hall and a large stone retaining wall, with stone steps in between, appearing extremely solemn and grand. The surroundings of the tomb will be planted with flowers and trees, and roads will be built around it, connecting to Dachang in the west and Lingnan Road in Zhabei in the south, so that those who come to pay their respects will not have the inconvenience of detours.</p>
<h3>Erecting a Stone Stele to Perpetuate History</h3>
<p>Since the remains of the generals and soldiers of the Shanghai battle have already been transported to the capital and buried at the foot of Zijin Mountain, this tomb is purely commemorative in nature. Inside the hall, only a stone stele, more than ten feet high, will be erected, inscribed with the Shanghai battle and the process of establishing the tomb, for future generations to pay their respects. On the walls around, various souvenirs of the war at that time, the clothing and portraits of the martyrs, and various things related to the fallen soldiers that are worth keeping as historical memorials will all be collected and displayed within, so that the extremely tragic and cruel foreign insults suffered during the Shanghai battle can forever leave a deep impression in the minds of future generations.</p>
<h3>Raising Funds and Commencing Construction on Schedule</h3>
<p>Regarding the funding part, it has recently been raised. In addition to the thirty acres of land donated by various sectors of Baoshan and the ten thousand silver dollars donated by the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Local Maintenance Association, the remainder was raised by donations from various sectors. It is learned that the fundraising campaign has reportedly been concluded by various banks, raising approximately tens of thousands of dollars. The shortfall has been supplemented by a telegraphic transfer of 20,000 dollars in subsidies from the Executive Yuan of the National Government. The estimated construction cost of the tomb is more than 50,000 dollars, so most of the funding has already been secured. Architect Dong will submit the design drawings to the preparatory committee for review in the next few days, and construction will begin immediately. It is expected that it will be completed in six months, at which time an extremely tragic and grand completion ceremony will be held.</p>
<h3>Fujianese Telegraph to the Government Requesting Active Reorganization of Fujian Province</h3>
<p>The Overseas Fujianese Associations' Joint Association for Saving the Homeland, in view of the years of turmoil in Fujian and the urgent need for reorganization of the local area, telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, requesting the formulation of concrete plans to actively reorganize the local area. The original text is excerpted below: To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, with respect: Our Fujian has suffered years of corrupt government and bandit disasters, the local area is devastated, and the people are suffering unspeakably. Although the Fujian situation has been pacified and various parts of western Fujian have been gradually recovered, the local aftermath urgently needs reorganization, and the people's suffering remains unresolved. The associations feel that their homeland has suffered terribly for years due to poor local reorganization. At this time, with the Fujian situation initially stabilized, they especially appeal to the Central Government to formulate concrete plans for major issues such as banditry, local autonomy, civilian armies and militias, exorbitant taxes, and education and transportation in Fujian Province, and to actively reorganize the local area in order to save the people of Fujian from fire and water. We await your urgent orders with utmost anticipation. Respectfully, Overseas Fujianese Associations' Joint Association.</p>

<h3>The Yisheng Vessel Has Arrived in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The Jardine Matheson's Yisheng vessel, which was robbed by pirates this time, did not have large sums of money on board. Their purpose was to kidnap passengers. After the bandits escaped with the stolen goods, the Yisheng went to Shantou. The shipowner, BERANTSEN, telegraphed the Hong Kong office from Shantou, and the Hong Kong office then telegraphed the Shanghai office. The Yisheng vessel first went to Shantou to sort out everything and unload the cargo, and then sailed to Hong Kong. According to news from the company yesterday, the Yisheng has indeed left Shantou for Hong Kong and should arrive last night. The Hong Kong office has telegraphed a detailed report of the robbery to Shanghai, but the Shanghai office is keeping it secret and does not want to announce the names of the kidnapped people and the amount of the stolen losses.</p>
<h3>Shareholder of Xingtai Foreign Firm Sues Manager</h3>
<p>Result: Apology Settles the Matter</p>
<p>Zhou Jinyu, a native of Fenghua, Zhejiang, and manager of the Xingtai Foreign Firm at 3 Hankou Road, was recently sued in the First Special District Court by Deng Rengui, a shareholder of the firm, through lawyer Lin Yingqing, on charges of breach of trust. A trial has been held once. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi presided over a continued interrogation in the Eighth Criminal Division. According to the plaintiff Deng Rengui, the basis of his lawsuit was that the defendant jointly opened the Xingtai Foreign Firm in November of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], with him serving as manager and the plaintiff serving as deputy manager. Unexpectedly, the defendant, harboring malicious intentions, established another company, Xinfeng, to do Xingtai's business, and on November 16 of last year, he privately sent a letter to a British London client, stating that Xingtai would definitely go bankrupt at the end of the lunar year, deliberately destroying Xingtai's reputation and disregarding the law. He should be punished for breach of trust. When questioned, Zhou Jinyu admitted that he had been a shareholder with two thousand shares when Xingtai was founded and had served as manager, but he had not established another company, Xinfeng. The content of the letter he wrote to the client did not match what the plaintiff said. Now, after mediation by friends, he is willing to publish an apology in the newspaper, etc. Judge Wu ordered a rescheduling and instructed the defendant to publish an apology in the newspaper within five days.</p>

<h3>Second Participation in the Chicago Fair to Commence in Mid-Next Month</h3>
<p>Council Decides to Revise the Labeling of Products</p>
<p>Based on the Principle of Attracting International Market Attention</p>
<p>Last year, the products from our country participating in the Chicago Exposition won considerable praise from people in the United States. This year, the association still intends to hold it, and our country has also decided to participate again. The Liaison Association stationed in Chicago, after the executive director returned to the country, has each been working separately, soliciting products. Recently, Council Member Zhou Guanrong went to Jiangxi to collect products and has now arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited him and received the following account of the process:</p>
<p>Focus on Displaying Products　　Last year, most of the exhibits from our country participating in various displays tended to focus on culture and art. It was only when the conference opened that it was learned that the products sent by other countries to participate were mostly focused on international trade. Although we won good reputation at the time, we did not get any real benefit in terms of trade promotion. Therefore, after the council decided on the exhibits to participate in this session, it was decided to focus on our country's porcelain, cotton, paper, summer cloth, and other famous products from various places that can attract people's attention in the international market. A small number of exquisite products with cultural value will also be taken along.</p>
<p>Convening of the Council Meeting　　When the reporter further inquired about the date of departure, it was said that it must wait until the council meeting is convened before it can be determined. The approximate travel date is in mid-April. The reason why he came to Shanghai so urgently this time was that he received a Shanghai telegram in Jiangxi, so he rushed here. Unexpectedly, Council Member Dong Kunfan has not yet returned to Shanghai from Fujian because of collecting products and arranging other matters, so the meeting could not be held immediately. It is expected that Council Member Zhou will also come to Shanghai in the next few days. Finally, the reporter further inquired about whether it was true that the ancient instruments from the Beijing Observatory would be transported to Chicago for display. According to reports, this matter was requested by the Chicago Exposition on behalf of the Chicago Planetarium. This matter is currently being negotiated with the government. As long as they are carefully protected during transportation, it is expected that the government will not object.</p>
<h3>Li Monong Has Been Sent to the Capital</h3>
<p>Not Taken to the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, Li Monong, the son-in-law of Central Committee Member He Xiangning, was arrested on suspicion of being a communist. Since being brought to the Public Security Bureau on the 13th, Central Committee Members Wu Zhihui, Liu Yazi, and others went to bail him out but were unsuccessful. The next day, according to Director Peng of the Special Affairs Section of the Public Security Bureau, Li Monong confessed that evening that he was a communist because of numerous witnesses and material evidence that could not be denied, but he refused to surrender. He was transferred to the Garrison Headquarters that night. However, when reporters inquired at the Longhua Songhu Garrison Headquarters, they said that he had not been sent there and was still detained in the Public Security Bureau. According to reliable information obtained by the New Sound News Agency reporter yesterday, Li Monong was sent to Nanjing on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Wanxiang Crashes Into a Barge</h3>
<p>All Boatmen Rescued</p>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Wanxiang ship sailed from Hankou to Shanghai yesterday. At 9:50 AM, it entered the Wusongkou, and at 11:30 AM, it arrived at the Huangpu River. Near the Customs Wharf, just as it was riding the high tide, the captain, Liu Xunda, proceeded according to the route. The ship turned around the Waitan River surface outside the Waitan Bridge and moved south. There was a large barge loaded with coal coming out of Lujiazui and heading to Pudong to unload. The Wanxiang was moving fast with the tide, and Captain Liu urgently pulled the horn and ordered it to give way, but the barge could not retreat, and the Wanxiang did not have time to reverse, resulting in a collision. The bow of the Wanxiang hit the center of the barge, causing it to overturn immediately. The cargo and boatmen in the barge all fell into the water, and the barge's hull was pinned down by the Wanxiang's bow and could not be shaken off for a while. All the boatmen, including the captain, who fell into the water were rescued by nearby small sampans and water patrol boats. Fortunately, they were all rescued, but the cargo was completely lost. As for the barge that collided with the Wanxiang's bow, a small Jianghai Customs tugboat came forward and managed to tow it down, then dragged it to the Huangpu River and parked the broken barge there. Afterwards, the rescued boat captain reported to the Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Office and the Water Patrol Team and negotiated with the Sanbei Company for compensation.</p>
<h3>Hu Yazhou Mixes Into Court and Openly Instigates Testimony</h3>
<p>Aftermath of the Case of Using Counterfeit Currency</p>
<p>Hu Detained in Court for Investigation According to Law</p>
<p>Han Shoushan, a Chinese detective from the General Police Station, previously arrested a man named Wei Zichun for using counterfeit currency. Forty-one counterfeit five-yuan banknotes were found next to the child Wei was carrying. He was sent to the First Special District Court, which, after investigation, sentenced him to five years in prison. Unexpectedly, Wei was not convinced and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu and Assessors Jiang and Zhou opened a court hearing. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated the circumstances of the case, and also stated that the girl Wei was carrying at the time has now been summoned to court by the police, and she can prove everything herself. At this time, Hu Yazhou, sitting in the audience, suddenly approached the girl and whispered to her. Detective Han Shoushan noticed this and reported it to Judge Yu, saying that Hu's suspicious behavior seemed to be instigating testimony and should be noted. Judge Yu then summoned the child for questioning, but she stammered and hesitated. After strict questioning, the child still refused to tell the truth. The court then summoned Hu Yazhou and asked him about his address, occupation, and reasons for coming to court. Hu initially claimed to be a coal broker, then said that he was a runner for lawyer Shen Fuxiang. Since the Shen lawyer requested by the appellant was introduced by him, he came to court to listen. After reviewing the confession, Judge Yu felt that Hu was very ingratiating and had been seen in court more than once. He also recalled that this person had recently testified in court in another case. He then ordered the case files to be checked. It was then discovered that when Wu Zhongwu and Fang Yixian's case of embezzlement and appeal was opened, Hu was one of the witnesses in the case. However, when checking his testimony that day, it was discovered that there was suspicion of perjury. He felt that Hu usually mixed into the court under false pretenses, solicited lawsuits, instigated testimony, and made perjury his duty, which was not allowed by law and should be thoroughly investigated and severely punished to warn against cunning and treachery. Therefore, after the trial of Wei Zichun's case was concluded, Hu Yazhou was immediately handed over to the detectives and taken to the police station for investigation and prosecution according to law.</p>
<h3>Gamblers Gather in Card Game Pai Gow in Cloth Exchange</h3>
<p>Police Receive Tip and Make Arrest</p>
<p>Twenty-Two Gamblers Caught</p>
<p>The Central Police Station of the Public Concession received a tip around 4:50 PM yesterday, claiming that people were gathering to gamble on Pai Gow in room 120 on the fourth floor of the Cloth Exchange at 80 Rue Edouard VII, with large sums of money being won and lost. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to secretly investigate at the address. As expected, more than twenty people were gathered in the room, happily shouting and cheering. When they saw the detectives arrive, they could not escape. Twenty-two gamblers, including Yang Bingqing, Xu Fulin, and Yan Bosheng, were arrested on the spot, along with gambling equipment such as dice and bets, and taken to the police station. After interrogation by the police chief, it was learned that there were several exchange brokers, clerks, and foreigners among them. As it was late, they were temporarily detained and will be sent to the court this morning for investigation.</p>
<h3>Large Fire in Zhabei Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Seventy to Eighty Thatched Sheds Destroyed on Guangzhao Road</p>
<p>Around 4 AM yesterday, a fire broke out again behind the house of Su Chengdong, a native of Yancheng, who lived in a thatched shed at the intersection of Guangzhao Road and Hengfeng Road in Zhabei. In an instant, the flames spread in all directions and could not be controlled. The residents of the sheds and the residents of the tile houses along Hengfeng Road were awakened from their sleep in alarm, crying and screaming, and the order was in chaos. Fortunately, the police officers at the four-district two-branch police station learned about it early and telephoned the fire brigade, which drove the fire engines to the scene to extinguish the fire. It was extinguished at more than 6 AM. All seventy to eighty thatched sheds there were almost completely burned down, and the surrounding tile houses were not affected, which was also fortunate. Later, the police officer on duty at the station took the fire starter, Su Chengdong, to the station. According to his confession, he was 53 years old and had five family members, including his children and his elderly wife. For some reason, the rapeseed stalks placed behind his house suddenly caught fire this morning. After being alerted by people shouting, he tried to press down hard with clothes, but it was ineffective, leading to this disaster, etc. After the interrogating officer reviewed the confession, since the case was related to a fire, he immediately prepared a document and sent it to the Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau of Zhabei for disposition. Later, the reporter found out that the location of the fire was bordered by Guangzhao Road to the north, municipal houses along Hengfeng Road to the west, and tile houses also connected to the east and south, and most of the tile houses had fire insurance. Fortunately, it had just cleared up after several days of rain, and the fire engines arrived quickly, otherwise the consequences would have been unimaginable. The area of the fire was about ten acres, and the number of people affected was about one thousand.</p>
<h3>Preparation Process of the Nanshi National Goods Department Store</h3>
<p>More Than Thirty Participating Manufacturers Display in Departments</p>
<p>Uniform Pricing to Cultivate Merchant Ethics</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai and Wang Tingsong Hosted the Press Last Night</p>
<p>The Nanshi National Goods Department Store of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to open on the 21st of this month. Yesterday at 6 PM, Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Yansong, and others, hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city. During the dinner, Wang Xiaolai and Wang Yansong reported on the preparation process, saying, "Distinguished guests, we are very happy that you are here today. The reason why we have invited you here to talk is about the Nanshi National Goods Department Store. We want to rely on you to promote it widely in the newspapers to promote national attention. Our association has an unshirkable responsibility to promote national goods and sell domestic products in business terms. In the 20th year of the Republic [1931], we set aside a part of the product exhibition hall to establish a department store, which achieved remarkable results. Now, in view of the urgent national crisis, the promotion of national goods must be strengthened. Therefore, we founded the Nanshi National Goods Department Store at the former site of the county chamber of commerce on Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen, Nanshi. It has been several months since the preparation, and it is now roughly ready and decided to be officially opened on the 21st of this month. Now, I will briefly report to you on the preparation process.</p>
<p>Duties　The reasons why our association organized the department store have been mentioned earlier. After deciding to establish the Nanshi National Goods Department Store, we immediately appointed Mr. Yang Zhenxin to be in charge, appointed various staff members, and set up a preparation office on the third floor of the exhibition hall.</p>
<p>Registration　After the staff and office were decided, registration began on January 16. At that time, those who heard the news and participated were quite enthusiastic, such as China Enamel Factory, Asia-Pacific Electrical Appliance Factory, Qiming Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Huafu Hat Factory, Huahua Silk Bureau, China Chemical Industry Society, Heji Biscuit and Canned Food Company, Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Scenery Factory, Guangdong Brothers Rubber Factory, Shengsheng Pasture, China National Goods Company, and more than thirty other companies.</p>
<p>Decoration　When our association started registration, on the one hand, in view of the fact that the former county chamber of commerce in Nanshi had been borrowed by government agencies, and the internal situation was not suitable for stores, we hired workers to renovate and decorate everything. The staff designed and planned to ensure that the form was new and suitable for the current situation.</p>
<p>Departments　The interior of the department store is divided into silk department, cloth department, woolen department, knitwear department, sanitary clothing department, candy canned food department, electrical appliance department, cosmetics department, sanitary products department, accessories toothbrush department, woolen straw hat department, ball shoes department, leather goods department, porcelain department, hardware department, copper department, local products department, clock department, cotton department, wool department, umbrella handkerchief department, silk scenery department, enamel department, thermos department, tobacco and alcohol department, stationery department, toy department, suit supplies department, and more than thirty other departments. The participating manufacturers are all the largest factories in Shanghai, and their products are exquisite and inexpensive. In the future, they will definitely arouse the interest of the people of Nanshi in using domestic goods, create a great force for domestic goods, and give foreign goods a great blow. Therefore, the order is neat and orderly, which cannot but be mentioned to you.　Cheap Price　The various goods in the department store are for the sake of promoting national goods. After the first meeting, it was decided that the goods should be cheap and of good quality, and there should be no bargaining, so as to cultivate merchant ethics and customer convenience.</p>
<p>Gifts　Moreover, the department store will also distribute gifts to all sectors of society at the opening, which is a small intention to promote national goods and is also sympathized with by all of you present. The above is the real situation of the preparation process of the department store. I hope that you will promote it widely in the spirit of promoting national goods. It is not only the fortune of the department store, but also the honor of the national goods industry.</p>
<h3>New Cotton Cloth Market Building to Be Completed Soon</h3>
<p>The China National Cotton Cloth Market on Guizhou Road in this city, since being reorganized and with Zhang Rongchu as general manager, immediately started building a new market in Jiyi Lane on Ningbo Road. Recently, with the business booming, the basic machine households have all signed contracts separately, and established rules for rewards and punishments. Cotton cloth dealers from various places have sent letters requesting an early official opening. This is because cotton cloth merchants deeply feel the difficulty of procuring goods, either due to incomplete categories, reduced quality, or chaotic prices. There must be a unified approach to eliminate long-standing malpractices. The main purpose of the market is to control the Shanghai domestic cotton cloth industry and promote the sale of domestic yarn. All facilities are designed to improve the cotton cloth industry and coordinate production and sales. The amount of cloth collected from various small machine households has reached more than 30,000 pieces. Recently, merchants from various regions have gradually become enthusiastic about purchasing goods. The goods collected by the market are very suitable for the needs of various merchants, and the perfect methods, excellent quality, and low prices are especially praised by various merchants. The market is now actively rushing to build the new market, which will soon be completed, and the opening date is not far away.</p>

<h3>Jiading Xiangzhen Road Forces Collection of Road Tolls; Taxi Industry Asks for Prevention</h3>
<p>The Taxi Industry Association requests the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Municipal Public Works Bureau to stop Jiading County's Xiangzhen Highway from forcing the collection of donation fees, which cost $0.20 per vehicle per trip. The text of their submission is as follows: The submission is regarding the illegal forced collection of donation fees on the Jiading County Xiangzhen Highway, humbly requesting an order from the Jiading County Government to quickly stop it, in order to relieve commercial difficulties and benefit transportation. According to a letter from a member of the association, Xiang Sheng Zhen Ru Gong Da and other car companies, stating that their cars traveling to Nanxiang are illegally forced to pay donation fees on the Xiangzhen Highway, at $0.20 per vehicle per trip (evidence attached), otherwise they will not be allowed to pass. These companies donate and receive licenses from the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, which state that they can travel in five provinces. Now the Xiangzhen Highway forces the collection of donation fees, which not only harms merchants and people but also violates the temporary regulations for inter-provincial and inter-municipal automobile traffic. It is requested that your association forward this to the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau for justified negotiations, and submit it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the Jiading County Government to quickly stop it in order to relieve commercial difficulties and benefit transportation. According to this, the licenses donated and received by the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau state that they can travel in five provinces, which has already been implemented and filed. Now the Xiangzhen Highway forces the collection of donation fees, which is very inappropriate. Therefore, this submission is to request your approval. We humbly request that you quickly order the Jiading County Government to forward the order to stop this illegal donation fee, in order to relieve commercial difficulties and benefit transportation. In addition to submitting a request to the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau for justified negotiations, this submission is respectfully presented.</p>
<h3>Current Status of New Silone Forest Project</h3>
<p>New Silone Wing On Forest Co., Ltd., since establishing a branch in Shanghai the year before last and issuing forest property certificates, has been quite trusted by the Chinese people, so in two years, a total of thousands of acres have been sold, with a selling price of 30 pounds sterling per acre. The company provides planting services without additional charges. According to the officially published softwood prices in the United States and Canada for the past 20 years, it is estimated that logging and selling after 12 years can yield a value of 250 pounds sterling. It is said that the soil and climate of New Silone are the most suitable in the world for planting pine trees. Its 12-year height averages 60 feet, with a circular diameter of 5 feet, and the growth rate is about four times faster than elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Fellow Association Performing Drama for Fundraising</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Shanghai Fellow Association held a tea party at the association yesterday to discuss fundraising for performing a drama. Mr. Chen Feinong and Director Xue Juexian were invited to the meeting. More than twenty directors and supervisors, including Tang Hai'an, Guo Shun, Pan Zhiquan, Chen Fengyuan, and Guo Qiming, attended the meeting. Chairman Tang Hai'an and recorder Zhou Fanglong presided over the meeting. First, the chairman delivered a speech, stating that since the establishment of the association, funding has often been stretched. Recently, it is planned to hold a drama performance to raise funds. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of the two great artists, Chen Feinong and Xue Juexian, who agreed to perform, we would like to express our warmest welcome to the two gentlemen. Next, Xue Juexian and Chen Feinong gave speeches successively, with many humble words. Then, the implementation method was discussed, and it was decided to organize a preparatory committee to be responsible for handling the matter. Xue Juexian, Chen Fengyuan, Cui Pingxi, Li Dachao, Zheng Zhengqiu, Zheng Xingpu, and Li Qianheng were elected as members of the preparatory committee, with Xue Juexian as the chairman. The performance location is tentatively scheduled at the Tianchan Stage, and the performance date will be determined by the preparatory committee.

<h3>Chinese Typewriter Patent Approved</h3>
<p>Five Major Factories Actively Manufacturing</p>
<p>The Chinese typewriter invented by Yu Binqi, which is convenient for all walks of life, has been reserved patent by the government since the Republic of China 19th year, and approved for manufacturing. Since then, he has personally led workers to strive hard. In the past, due to the initial stage of establishment, the project was not perfect, and gradually improved. Especially in the National Goods Year, he contacted Shanghai National Goods factories to manufacture separately and personally reformed. In the past year, more than one hundred units have been produced, and sold out in ten months. With increased production, experience gradually increased, and technology greatly improved. Last month on the 26th, the Ministry of Industry approved the patent and specially commended it. After the disclosure in the newspaper, government agencies, banks, companies, and shops suddenly increased purchases. The factory is rushing to produce day and night, but it is still not enough to meet the demand. In order to precisely manage, the Yu Cooperative Factory Management Office is specially established at 541 Zhaofeng Road in Shanghai, in order to be close to the factory for easy guidance. Recently, the left and right movers of the machine have been changed from square to round, which is strangely sensitive. The newly produced steel characters, when typed on wax paper, can be mimeographed more than a thousand copies, and the ink is also more obvious, which is a world of difference from the products of the previous year. Now, during the opening period, the selling price will be reduced by 10% to show promotion. Recently, many people who are concerned about national goods have come to the factory to visit. Mr. Yu cordially welcomes and explains in detail.</p>
<h3>Tan Yunshan Sets Sail Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tan Yunshan, a professor of Chinese Literature and Buddhist Scriptures at the International University of India, took the Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou Wheel to India yesterday afternoon. Those who saw him off included Liu Huijiu of the International Culture China Association, Liu Renhang of the Oriental Culture Society, Huang Jingwan of the Commercial Press, and Qian Fuqu of China, and other 20 people. Before leaving, Tan said to the guests, "Although India belongs to an oppressed nation, there are tens of millions of people scattered in various countries, and there is a movement to revive the country. India was enlightened the earliest, and cultural undertakings should be actively communicated to conform to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will and unite the weak nations. When China is in internal and external troubles, the spirit of Gandhi should be emulated."</p>
<h3>County Government Strictly Urges Completion of Winter Grain Tax</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai County's 22nd year second phase of land price tax, i.e., the winter grain tax, by the end of last month, the three-month limit has expired. Now the county government has checked that the number of households that have not completed payment is still huge, so County Magistrate Pan, in addition to instructing the tax collectors to impose late payment fines in accordance with regulations, also instructed the district tax collection officials to urge the collection and clear all debts in order to complete the work.</p>
<h3>County Government Repairs Rural Roads and Bridges</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has now found that the rural roads in the county were originally very wide, but ignorant farmers, disregarding public interests, have either encroached on them for fields or occupied them as building foundations. Over time, they have become narrow paths, which really hinder people's travel. In order to rectify traffic throughout the county, it has already instructed the district chiefs to supervise and urge the township and village leaders to quickly investigate the original road requisition and use local manpower to build them wider. Bridges within their borders that have been in disrepair for many years and are damaged or collapsed should also be supervised and urged to repair them at any time. If there are any technical matters, they may request the county government to send personnel to guide them. The locations, dimensions, engineering, and reorganization plans for the roads and bridges that should be widened and repaired should be clearly reported for investigation.</p>
<h3>Guangdong People's Hospital Joint Celebration</h3>
<p>The Guangdong People's Hospital, established by the Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Association, held a banquet at the New Asia Restaurant on Nanjing Road on the 15th to celebrate its reorganization. The Guangdong Fellow Association's directors and the hospital's volunteer doctors were invited. Directors Chen Fengyuan, Chen Qifen, Mai Zuoheng, and the doctors attended. During the banquet, Hospital Director Wu Jishun announced the hospital's recent situation and future expansion plans. He also announced the hired volunteer doctors: Director of Medical Affairs and Director of Pediatrics and Internal Medicine, Dr. Chen Daming, MD from McGill University in the UK; Director of General Affairs and Director of Surgery and X-ray, Dr. Huang Wen, MD from the UK; Director of Nursing, Dr. Tan Yunzhen, MD from the USA; Director of Dentistry, Dr. Liang Beihe, DDS from Northwestern University in the USA; Director of Dermatology and Venereology, Dr. Chen Hongkang, MD from the University of Edinburgh in the UK and the University of Breslau in Germany; Director of Obstetrics, Su Shouzhen from the Xia Ge Women's Medical College; Director of Gynecology, Dr. Chen Jiyao, MD from Northwestern University in the USA; Director of Ophthalmology, Otolaryngology, Dr. Lin Shixi, MD from Johns Hopkins University in the USA; Director of Tuberculosis, Dr. Kuang Cuie, MD from Han Li Lu University in the USA. All of the above doctors graduated from famous first-class medical universities in the UK and the USA and have served in various famous hospitals for many years, so they are all experienced and knowledgeable. Director Wu also said that the doctors are willing to sacrifice their energy and time to manage the Guangdong People's Hospital and benefit the fellow villagers, which is really commendable. That night, everyone gathered together, raised their glasses, and talked happily until 10:30 PM, when they dispersed with pleasure.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Xuzhou Joint Transport Less-Than-Carload Freight Cars</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented on April 1st</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau previously agreed with the Jinpu Railway that all Shanghai-Xuzhou joint transport less-than-carload freight cars would be directly escorted by personnel sent by both parties to ensure integrity. However, the two railway transport departments previously lacked sufficient escort personnel, resulting in the joint transport less-than-carload freight still being handed over in Pukou. The original plan has not yet been implemented. Now that the less-than-carload freight cars on this railway have been changed to be attached to regional passenger trains, the original freight dispatchers can free up three people to serve as Shanghai-Xuzhou joint transport less-than-carload freight escorts. However, it is still necessary to allocate eight workers to take turns serving on the trains. In order to facilitate the work, eight luggage porters from the Shangbei Station have been selected and trained. At the same time, an agreement has been reached with the Pulu Railway that the joint transport plan will be implemented on April 1st.</p>
<h3>Wusong Whitebait on the Market</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has been sunny and warm, and the fishing season at Songkou has arrived. Therefore, the general fishing boats are all netting in the waters around the Three Gorges. In the past two days, some fishing boats have caught whitebait and brought them into port. Whitebait (commonly known as noodle fish) is white and fresh, and is a specialty of Songkou. However, in the early stages of the season, the supply is small, and it can only be sold in the fish shops in Songdi. It is rare to see it in Shanghai. The price of the fish is surprisingly high. Initially, it only cost one yuan per pound of fish. Yesterday, it has been changed to about two pounds per yuan. It is said that it will not be available for sale in Shanghai until a large number of fishing boats arrive in port.</p>
<h3>Zhonghe Bank Holds Shareholders' Meeting</h3>
<p>The Zhonghe Bank on Nanjing Road in Shanghai held its third annual shareholders' meeting in the bank's conference hall on the 10th of this month.

As a result, Song Hanzhang, Qin Runqing, Xu Fusun, Sheng Xiaoshan, Wu Peichu, Feng Zhongqing, Xie Taofu, Rong Zongjing, Yuan Songfan, Guo Zhuqiao, and Chen Qingfeng were elected as the second board of directors. Zhang Qingsheng, Cheng Shaofu, and Li Jisheng were elected as the fourth supervisors.</p>
<h3>Marriage Guidance Co-authored by Educational Experts Sweeps the Country</h3>
<p>--Essential Reading for Young Men and Women--</p>
<p>Men and women living together is a major human relationship, but nowadays, many young people have blind marriages and promiscuous relationships, resulting in irreparable consequences. The Diligent Bookstore at 392 Lao Shenfu Road in the French Concession of this city, in view of this, specially hired domestic educational celebrities to compile a book on marriage guidance.

<h3>Questioning After the Sudden Death of Zheng Yangchu's Concubine</h3>
<p>Fellow Villagers Express Exceptional Grief</p>
<p>To Thoroughly Investigate Whether She Was Forced to Take Poison</p>
<p>Huang, the concubine of the late Zheng Yangchu, a wealthy merchant in the pawnshop industry and a native of Chaozhou, suddenly died suddenly on the night of the 13th of this month. By 8:00 AM the next morning, she was discovered and spread far and wide. Zheng Jiaoshun, Zheng Guoan, Zheng Jinzhi, and other relatives learned of it and reported it to the French police. They all stated that Zheng Huang's death was unclear because the first wife, Zheng Wu, was usually violent and Huang was suspected of being forced to death, requesting a thorough investigation. The police then carried the body to the morgue. The day before yesterday, Wang Ren, prosecutor of the Second Special Court, and Jiang Jun, a forensic doctor, arrived at the morgue at noon to examine the body. Because there were no injuries on the outside, it was impossible to verify the true cause of death. Later in the afternoon, the corpse was dissected, and a small piece of opium that had not completely dissolved was found on the left side of the stomach. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the Zheng family prepared a coffin and clothing and went to the morgue to collect the body. At that time, according to a Zheng family member, after the death of her husband Zheng Yangchu, the deceased, although a concubine, was able to abide by the virtues of a woman. Unexpectedly, the first wife Wu was criticized by outsiders, which was despised by the family. This time, the news of Huang's death spread, and fellow villagers expressed exceptional grief. It is also heard that the Chaozhou Fellow Association attaches great importance to this case and intends to request the Second Special Court and the French police to thoroughly investigate whether she was forced to take poison in order to emphasize human life and promote justice.</p>

<h3>Husband is Immoral, Commits Crimes, and Has Evidence of Adultery</h3>
<p>Young Woman Sues for Divorce</p>
<p>Court Conciliation Fails</p>
<p>Zhang Qinglun, a native of Ningbo, had an affair with Chen Lanfang, a woman from his hometown, in the Republic of China Year 16. He then came to Shanghai to live with her and went through the marriage ceremony, with Shen Zheng as the matchmaker. After the marriage, Zhang did not engage in proper work and associated with bandits. He has been convicted by the government twice. Recently, Chen filed a lawsuit for divorce with the First Special District Court through a lawyer, claiming that Zhang had not engaged in proper work, associated with bandits, neglected her livelihood, and frequently assaulted her. The case was heard yesterday in the 11th Civil Court by Judge Yu Changzi. Chen Lanfang's reasons for divorce were that Zhang did not engage in proper work, associated with bandits, neglected her livelihood, and arbitrarily assaulted her. She also claimed that Zhang was having an affair and had slept with Dai Xiaomei at 46 Chunyang Lane on Dong Youheng Road at 12:00 midnight on the 28th of last month. She reported this to the Jiaxing Road Patrol Room, and Zhang and Dai were arrested. They admitted to having committed adultery twice, which can be verified. However, Zhang stated that he did not want a divorce and denied all the points alleged by the plaintiff. He also accused the plaintiff of having an affair with her cousin-in-law, Lu Weiting, saying that he saw Lu and Chen Lanfang together in the room when he returned home one day, and it was midnight. There was also a landlord who could testify to this. However, Chen Lanfang firmly denied it. The court then summoned Lu Weiting, who denied having an affair with Chen, saying that it was because Zhang borrowed money and failed. The court then advised both parties to reconcile, but ultimately failed because the conditions were too far apart. Finally, Shen Zheng testified about Zhang's beating of Chen Lanfang. The court then issued an order to change the date for further verification.</p>
<h3>Zhang Dabao Sentenced for Enticing a Virgin into Prostitution</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Four Months Imprisonment with a Two-Year Suspended Sentence</p>
<p>Zhang Hongying, a young woman from Liyang, was seventeen years old and possessed graceful beauty. Due to her family's poverty, on February 28th of this year, her mother brought her to Shanghai and placed her in the care of Zhang Dabao, a woman residing at No. 225 in the Laohuile Lane on Yunnan Road, to work as a maid for a term of three years. However, Zhang Dabao was of questionable character and, seeing the girl's delicate charm, conceived an evil plan. She dressed the girl in seductive attire and took her to the Oriental Hotel to solicit customers. On the 2nd of this month, a client named Yuan Lansheng opened room 252 in the Oriental Hotel and requested Zhang Hongying to stay overnight. That evening, due to a mahjong game with friends that lasted all night, Zhang Hongying managed to preserve her virginity. The next day, Zhang Hongying and Zhang Dabao were spotted on Yunnan Road by Yuan Lansheng, who argued with them to demand the return of his overnight fee.</p>
<p>They were then arrested by police officers and taken to the police station. Zhang Dabao was prosecuted by the First Special Court under Article 249 of the criminal law. The interrogation has concluded, and yesterday morning, presiding judge Feng Shide of the First Criminal Court announced the verdict: Zhang Dabao, with the intention of profit, enticed a respectable woman into indecent acts with others, and is sentenced to four months of imprisonment. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be credited at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The sentence is suspended for two years. Zhang Hongying was released into the custody of her mother, Tao Zhang. After the pronouncement, Zhang Hongying expressed her unwillingness to return home with her mother. Therefore, the police lawyer Li Zhishan stepped forward and stated that Zhang Hongying feared that if she left, she would be sold as a prostitute by her mother. Thus, she expressed her willingness to continue residing at the Jiliang Institute to receive education, with her mother allowed to visit her from time to time. It is hoped that after receiving adequate education in the future, her mother would take her back. Tao Zhang, on the other hand, requested permission to take her daughter back so that she could explain the situation to her husband. Judge Feng reviewed the statements and instructed Zhang Hongying to remain at the Jiliang Institute temporarily, pending her father's arrival to take her back.</p>

<p>Reading and Answering Questions</p>
<p>More on the Steps of Literary Study, Writing, and Others (2)</p>
<p>Yesterday, we raised three of the most basic questions for studying literature. First, we explained ... (1) What is the literature we need? Today, we will further discuss the second topic. Editor.</p>
<p>(1) How to Read Literary Works? Literary books can be roughly divided into two parts: one part is about theory, and the other part is creation, such as poetry, drama, and novels. The method of reading literary theory books is no different from the method of reading general social science books. We have already had a detailed discussion of this method in the previous issue. Now, we want to talk specifically about the method of reading literary works.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the general public, literature is essentially different from social science. In fact, this is not very accurate. This error arises from regarding literature as entertainment. In essence, literature and social science both express social reality. However, social science is a theoretical dissection, while literature is a depiction of life. The only difference between literature and social science lies in the methods of expression. Social science directly enlightens the reader's intellect; literary works must reach the intellect through the reader's emotions. Reading social science requires a calm mind; reading literary works requires rich emotions. This point should be understood before discussing how to read literary books.</p>
<p>So, how should we read literary books? We can divide it into three steps: first, general reading; second, comparative reading; and third, critical reading.</p>
<p>Let's talk about general reading first. The most common reading method, as we know, is to read each sentence carefully. This is correct. If you don't read classical Chinese works without much content carefully, then you won't be able to learn the only rhetoric, "intonation, rise and fall, pause and break" of the writing. If you don't read science books carefully, then you won't be able to remember the scientific principles you want to remember. However, it would be too clumsy to apply this method to reading literary works. As mentioned earlier, we read literary works not to learn some writing techniques, but to obtain life data. That is to say, we should pay attention to the content of the work. For example, when reading a novel, we should pay attention to how the story unfolds, how the protagonist acts in the story, and what the central problem expressed by the story is. Simply put, just absorb the essence of the story. Even if you forget the other details of the description as you read, it doesn't matter. After reading, if we have a clear impression of the above points, then the preliminary work of our reading is completed. Therefore, reading literary works is not about reading carefully, but about reading a lot. The more you read, the richer the life data will be.</p>
<p>Second, it is comparative reading. It is not enough to simply absorb the content of a work. Because the content of works is diverse, some can nourish our lives, and some can corrode our lives. Therefore, we should filter what we read. This filtering is to compare the living social phenomena with the depictions of the works. We read literary works not only as literary works, but also as social science and as life records. We should not be deceived by the works. We should pay attention to how far the descriptions of the works deviate from reality. For example, there is a novel The Good Earth written by Mrs. Buck of the United States. Many people think that this novel is the best work describing the Chinese countryside. The author meticulously depicts the decline of the Chinese countryside and the famine of the farmers, and attributes the causes of this phenomenon to natural disasters and fate. But if we observe it from reality, are natural disasters the main reason for the decline of the Chinese countryside? Obviously not. The main force that destroys the Chinese countryside is the warlord war and the economic aggression of imperialism. In this way, we can know that this good earth is somewhat distorting the reality, and we have a further understanding of this work. Afterwards, we can talk about critical reading. The so-called critical reading is not to scrutinize every word and sentence of a work, but to criticize the various parts of the work from the development of the entire story and based on one's own sense of feeling. When we read a work, how do we distinguish whether the author's description method is good or not? The description is to make the content more vividly highlighted, and to make the content easier to infect the reader. From this point of view, we know that the detailed description is limited to the reader getting a clearer impression, and enhancing the expression power of the entire content, otherwise it is superfluous. Of course, the most important decision is still in the content of the work, and the form of literature is induced by the content. As in the Good Earth mentioned above, no matter how delicate its description is, but because its content is distorted from reality, whenever the story develops to a higher stage, it deliberately makes it turn or fall, then the description is also a kind of relief, a kind of embellishment and loses its strength.</p>
<p>In addition, I want to talk about one more point, that is, many readers feel difficult to read translated works. This difficulty is of course on the one hand because the descriptions in the translation are very unfamiliar with our real life, and on the other hand, it is because many personal names and place names are not easy to remember. If we want to overcome this difficulty, in addition to using the method of infusing more reading, regarding the former, we can only pay attention to choosing those works that are somewhat related to our lives when choosing works to read, and for the latter, because we only need to absorb the essence of the work, whether personal names and place names can be remembered or not has little to do with our reading.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>On the eve of Confucius's great beef feast, there was, as usual, a rehearsal of all sorts of "dances" and "music" related to the ritual. It was said that all educational authorities in areas where there were Confucius temples, and those scholars who were well-known, had to fast and bathe, and participate in the rehearsal.</p>
<p>Indeed, this tune had not been played for a long time, and if not for the rehearsal, there would inevitably be jokes. But jokes still happened, because for this kind of rehearsal, most "literati" were more fearful than excited, so the result of the rehearsal would not be very skilled.</p>
<p>That was the case before. Now, the so-called "dance" and "music" are probably more excited than fearful! So the result will definitely be skillful. However, the general students—perhaps they are also literati—can still strive for perfection, holding the same sex "Die Lü Du" "Du Luo Die" on the not-so-smooth floor in the dormitory and repeatedly "Swinging", it is said that this is also an exercise. From Confucius's point of view, "the younger generation" is indeed "to be feared"!</p>
<p>The Chinese are born lazy and are not willing to act rashly. In order to eat a New Year's beef feast for the Master, they have to brace themselves and rehearse late into the night, which is really rare. In addition, it is said that some people have also used the skill of rehearsal for foreign adults. This is probably the authority that Confucius gave them during the period of riding a raft to float on the sea. As described in the Record of Officialdom Observed, a certain governor of Shandong, in order to entertain foreign adults, had to rehearse all the etiquettes of shaking hands, "yes sir", and other ceremonies, so that he could not close his eyes all night, resulting in "dizziness" and still making many jokes!</p>
<p>This only refers to the rehearsal of "civil affairs". "Those who have civil affairs must have military preparations", now we may as well talk about the rehearsal of military preparations.</p>
<p>It was about the second Jiangzhe War, Sun Chuanfang had already marked the slogan "I will not offend others unless I am offended" on the front, it seemed difficult to break his promise and become the chief of Rong. But cunning has always been a common thing for military strategists. He entrusted the pretext of exercises and viewed the troops at Jianqiao. This exercise, from the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to the "Shanghai-Nanjing line", used "live ammunition shooting", "killing sounds shocking the sky", "spirit doubled". "Suzhou Governor" Yang Yuting was "sent off" when Sun's army was approaching Nanjing. Probably the lineup of Sun's army was far less than the scale of Japan's autumn exercise, so it was not worth a look.</p>
<p>That was still the case before. Now, the call for exercises is overflowing the globe, whether it is the army, the navy, or the air force, no country is willing to lose their opportunity to exercise. This only refers to the exercises of various countries in their own territories, territorial waters, and airspace. However, the US Navy's exercises in the Pacific Ocean have caused fear throughout Japan, which is strictly guarded against. But Japanese troops are exercising everywhere in Chinese territory,</p>
<p>They certainly don't think this is inappropriate, and we Chinese are just turning a blind eye! This kind of "exercise" with a grand spirit is truly "of long standing"! But now the Chinese seem to be "narrow-minded" a lot, knowing to raise a "protest"! Compared to the Qing officials who could not get a stuffy fart out of being beaten three times by foreign adults, it is really enjoyable!</p>
<h3>Mirror</h3>
<p>— Holding to Buddha</p>
<p>Mirrors are companions to people, especially women, who cannot be without them for a moment. Mirrors are also called "鑑" (jiàn, meaning to examine or reflect), and in ancient times they were made of bronze, but in modern times they began to be made of glass. The Book of Han says, "Use a mirror to examine one's past actions"; "Chen Nu drew with a mirror to observe herself," "Examine the beginning and end, the changes of strength and weakness, and clearly take them as a warning." Sima Guang wrote "Zizhi Tongjian" (Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Governance), and Zhang Juzheng wrote "Di Jian Tu Shuo" (Illustrated Explanations of Imperial Mirrors), which shows that the function of mirrors is not only to reflect appearances, but also to illuminate the heart.</p>
<p>People have different views on mirrors, some love them, some hate them. For a beautiful woman, as lovely as a flower or jade, she naturally faces the mirror, feeling pity for herself. It's not just that she looks real and lovely in the mirror, making others want to embrace her, but the beauty herself also looks at it again and again, applying rouge and powder, drawing eyebrows and dabbing lips, treating the mirror as a good companion for enhancing her beauty.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a woman who wrote in a poem: "At first sight, I don't know who is facing me, but on closer inspection, I truly feel pity for you." Song Dynasty people also had a few lines of poetry about mirrors, such as "A poor girl, as beautiful as a flower, is only known by the mirror"; "In the mirror, she should know her plain appearance, but in the world, people only see her red makeup"; "She pities herself endlessly, and lingers before leaving." Looking at these few lines of poetry, isn't the mirror a confidant to women? But, I once saw a woman write in a poem: "Looking at my haggard figure over the years, I'm afraid to face the blue mirror and afraid to be seen by others"—when beauty fades, one feels regret, but how can the mirror be held responsible! Ancient people also had a few lines of poetry saying, "The old are unwilling, but what can they do with the mirror"! "Who doesn't cherish a rosy face, but white hair knows it first." "Even if others see it, it's better than seeing it yourself"! Time will not flow backwards, and a rosy face of the past is now white hair, so why resent the mirror.</p>
<p>Grandma Liu mistakenly entered the Grand View Garden and saw an old woman coming towards her, and on closer inspection, it turned out to be herself. Grandma Liu had never seen a large mirror and almost made a joke, which is not surprising. However, this large mirror in the Grand View Garden, which daily reflects the flower-like and jade-like Yingying Yanyan (beautiful women); suddenly reflected an old country woman with wrinkled skin and white hair, is this Grandma Liu's good fortune? Or is it the misfortune of this mirror?</p>
<p>The mirror reflects the shape of things as they are, and has no preconceived notions of beauty, ugliness, length, shortness, squareness, or roundness. A person's heart is like a mirror, if there is no accumulation of dust, and it is diligently wiped every day, it will naturally be bright and clean, without any impurities. It is a pity that people in the world have heavy desires, and their nature is obscured by material desires, isn't it very much like a mirror covered with a thick layer of dust? At this time, if you use this mirror to reflect things, how can you reflect beauty, ugliness, goodness, evil, large, small, square, or round!</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p>
<p>Tearful Faces Bid Farewell as People Return Home to Distant Garrisons</p>
<p>Sand and Wind Sweep Through the Night as They Garrison a Lonely City Beyond the Border</p>
<p>The two brothers were also anxious and grabbed two villagers, stomping their feet and telling them not to run. The villagers thought their lives were in danger and squatted on the ground, screaming like pigs being slaughtered. Those villagers who wanted to run away were even more frightened when they saw this and ran even harder. The groom they had just met, carrying a woman with bound feet on his back, supporting her knees with both hands, also flew past. Ziqiang was both annoyed and amused, and said to the two soldiers: "Forget it, let them go, they are too pitiful." The two commoners squatting on the ground kowtowed, broke free from the hands of the two soldiers, and ran away in a puff of smoke. Ziqiang said: "This is terrible, let's go tell the battalion commander." So the four of them walked out of the fort, and the entire team had already arrived at the fort entrance. Ziqiang told the battalion commander about the situation here. Baofang frowned and smiled: "The villagers are pitifully stupid, there's nothing we can do about it. We originally just wanted them to lend us some houses to live in, but since they've all run away, we'll just have to seal up everyone's belongings, we'll live in half and leave half for the people to come back. This time the division commander instructed us again and again to make a good impression, we must make sure our military discipline and conduct are especially good. Everyone suffered a night of hardship, we have no choice, let's temporarily enter the fort to rest." As he spoke, the entire battalion had already entered the fort gate. After busying themselves for half a day, they cleared out twenty households. Soldiers were stationed there. Zhao Ziqiang lived in order of succession, and it happened to be in this mud house with the newly pasted wedding characters. Some simple things in this house had already been moved to the civilian houses where the troops were not stationed before the troops moved in. Now, there is only a mud kang, four yellow mud walls, and two or three pairs of festive couplets pasted on the walls, which cannot be removed. As soon as Ziqiang entered this room, he felt a slight tremor in his heart and stared blankly at the wall. (338)</p>
<h3>Research on Inkstones (4)</h3>
<p>— A Bored Guest</p>
<p>The culture of an era invariably shifts with the rise and fall of the nation, and all technical crafts advance or decline accordingly. During the Yuan Dynasty, chaos followed chaos, and there was essentially no culture to speak of. At that time, there were only a few inkstone-loving painters, such as Zhao Mengfu and Ni Zan, and the only famous inkstone that was passed down, as seen in the Guangcang Inkstone Record, was that of Empress Wuzong, which need not be discussed in depth. By the Ming Dynasty, culture had developed somewhat again, and special emphasis was placed on the establishment of the painting academy. At that time, scholars and literati, if they entered the painting academy, could immediately increase their reputation. The painting academy during the Xuande period was particularly well-known, and Xie Huan, Shang Xi, Dai Jin, Zhou Wenqing, and others all came from it. Famous painters from Jiangnan, such as Zhou Dongcun, Tang Yin, Qiu Ying, Shen Zhou, Wen Zhengming, Dong Qichang, Chen Jiru, etc., emerged one after another, and the relationship between calligraphy and painting and inkstones became even more crucial. Therefore, all famous calligraphers and painters loved inkstones, and if they obtained a famous stone, they would definitely seek out famous craftsmen to carve it and famous people to inscribe it. When the mines were opened during the Wanli period, Shuiyan (Water Rock) was discovered, and the name of Duan inkstone began to become famous. The Manchu Qing Dynasty succeeded the Ming Dynasty, and because both Kangxi and Qianlong were known for their love of inkstones, they tried their best to collect famous inkstones. Among those seen in the records, there are the twenty-four volumes of the Qianlong Imperial Collection of Western Green Inkstone Records, the sixty-four illustrations of the Baoku Inkstone Records, and six other types of records. Because the times were peaceful and the resources were abundant, the emperor advocated literature and art, and the scholar-officials followed suit. All those who were skilled in poetry and literature, as well as famous artists, devoted themselves to the aestheticization of inkstones, and spared no labor or financial resources to excavate the Duan mines. The essence of Shuiyan was fully expressed, and the beauty of inkstones can be said to have reached its peak, with nothing more to add. According to statistics, during the entire Qing Dynasty,</p>
<p>Famous inkstone lovers included Zhu Yizun, Wang Shizhen, Chen Gongyin, Pan Lei, Shi Runzhang, Wan Sitong, Song Luo, Gao Shiqi, Weng Songnian, Lin Jiren, Huang Shentian, Wang Shu, Ding Jingshen, Shen Tingfang, Ma Riguan, Ma Rilu, Yuan Mei, Wu Shengnian, Liu Yong, Weng Fanggang, Liang Tongshu, Ji Xiaolan, Yuan Shu, Qian Daxin, Ji Shouqiao, Ji Danshi, Wang Wenzhi, Yi Bingshou, Gui Weigu, Chen Hongshou, Wu Lanxiu, Wu Rongguang, Zhang Tingji, Zhang Zhidong, etc.;</p>
<p>Famous inkstone makers included Huang Zongyan, Pan Zihe, Kong Chuanzhuo, Gao Fenghan, Zhang Chun, Wang Yun, Pan Feng, Zhang Chongyi, Wu Yu, Sun Shenfu, Liu Xubai, Zhu Xu, Zhu Long, Gu Erniang, Jin Dongxin, Zhou Lanpo, Yang Longshi, etc.;</p>
<p>Regarding the writings on inkstones, the most famous ones include Gao Guzhai's "Duan Stone Examination," Yu Danxin's "Inkstone Forest," Pan Jiatang's "Duanxi Inkstone Stone Fu and Inscription," Zhu Zhuotuo's "Saying Inkstone and Inkstone Inscription," Shi Yushan's "Inkstone Forest Gleanings," Jin Dongxin's "Inkstone Inscription," Tang Hengquan's "Famous Inkstone Illustration Examination," Yuan Xiangting's "Notes on the Duanxi Inkstone Record in the Pen Record," Lin Peiyun's "Pottery Boat Inkstone History," Ji Xiaolan's "Inkstone Record in the Yuewei Cottage," Gao Fenghan's "Inkstone History," Huang Diancang's "Comprehensive Reference to the Duanxi Inkstone History," Zhu Ertuo's "Short History of Duan Inkstone," Chen Jieting's "Duan Stone Imitation," Ji Shouqiao's "Examination of the Duanxi Inkstone Pits," Wu Shengnian's "Record of the Duanxi Inkstone Pits," Li Zhaoluo's "Record of the Duanxi Inkstone Pits," Wu Lanxiu's "Duanxi Inkstone History," He Shiqing's "Distinguishing Treasures of the Treasure Inkstone Hall," Shen Shiyou's "Inkstone Forest," etc. Others, such as Wang Yuyang, Cao Qiuyue, Gao Xiaoqin, Yang Jingsu, etc., each have many records, which cannot be listed in detail. From this, it can be seen that during the Qing Dynasty, inkstone materials and literature and art both reached their peak, and the changes in inkstones also stopped there.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting Talks About Yamamoto Coming to China to Lobby</h3>
<p>Hoping to Allow the Puppet Manchukuo to Participate in the Games</p>
<p>China Basically Does Not Know There Is a Manchukuo</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Zhengting, Chairman of the National Sports Association, went to Beijing a few days ago to attend the Sports Committee meeting held by the Ministry of Education to discuss the pre-selection and economic issues of participating in the Far Eastern Games. The work has been completed. He returned to Shanghai from Beijing by express train yesterday morning at 7 o'clock. A reporter from Xin Xin News specially went to visit and inquire about everything. Wang replied that the funding for our country to participate in the Games is tentatively set at 70,000 yuan. The central government has agreed to allocate half of it, and the remaining half is being raised from the authorities of various provinces, which should not be a problem. As for the athletes, it is tentatively set at 160. In the future, I (Wang) plan to accompany all the athletes to participate. In addition, Professor Yamamoto of Waseda University in Japan visited a few days ago, completely for lobbying purposes, intending to request permission for the puppet Manchukuo to participate in the Far Eastern Games. At that time, I resolutely refused and replied that China does not know of the so-called "Manchukuo," and I am afraid that countries around the world also do not know "Manchukuo," so there is basically no talk of allowing it. It is like a woman who is not yet pregnant, but first prepares to celebrate her full moon. Is there such a ridiculous thing in the world, and so on.</p>

<h3>Scout Leaders in the Third District of Jiangsu Meet in Yangzhou</h3>
<p>(Yangzhou, 16th Telegram) Song Jingxiang and other leaders from 22 counties in the Third District of Jiangsu Scout, arrived in Yangzhou on the 16th. The joint meeting will be held on the 17th and 18th. Various agencies and groups will hold a public banquet on the 17th evening.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Explains the Examination Issues</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education's explanation of the examination issues is summarized below: (1) For the Shanghai Education Bureau's request for instructions on whether students in this city's middle school examinations who fail one subject can take a supplementary examination on behalf of the education authorities in other cities, the bureau was instructed to allow the bureau to entrust the competent education department to take the supplementary examination on its behalf. (2) The Jiangsu Education Department submitted a request for an explanation of the ambiguity in Article 10 of the Regulations on Graduation Examinations for Middle School Students (this article stipulates that high school students who fail two or one subject are allowed to participate in the examination of each subject in the next session. If they wish to continue their studies, they may be issued a certificate of admission to higher education by the competent administrative agency and be allowed to take the examination for higher education. After being admitted, they will be allowed to be probationary students. They will not be regarded as regular students until they have participated in the examination of each subject in the next session and obtained a graduation certificate. A detailed examination of the provisions seems to have some ambiguity. In case they participate in the examination of each subject in the next session and still fail, those who have not continued their studies will not be allowed to graduate, and those who have continued their studies will not be regarded as regular students, which will greatly hinder the students' future. Can it be allowed to participate in the examination of each subject in the next session once again, in order to provide relief, in accordance with the example of repeating the grade twice?) The department was instructed to allow the student to participate in the examination of each subject in the next session once again, in accordance with the example of repeating the grade twice. (3) The Shanghai National Military Training Committee submitted a request that military training be included in the high school or above school examinations, and the committee was instructed to check that students who fail the military training course will not be allowed to graduate in accordance with Article 6 of the National Education Law, that is, they will not be able to participate in the graduation examination, and that the request to include military training in the school examinations should be unnecessary. (4) The Shandong Education Department submitted two explanatory differences in Articles 62 and 63 of the Middle School Regulations (there are differences in the interpretation of attending the original grade and studying in the original grade in Article 63, and Article 62 does not specify the number of times to repeat the grade). The department was instructed to check that there are no words for repeating the grade in the terms of Article 62 of the Regulations. If a student has been demoted to study in a lower grade for one semester, and still fails two subjects listed in that article next time, they should be ordered to drop out of school. If only one subject fails, or two subjects fail, and the subjects are not as stipulated in that article, they should be handled in accordance with Article 63. As for Article 63, (if they still fail, they should still study in the original grade in the next academic year) has been corrected by the Ministry to (the original grade), and has been notified to all on file.</p>
<h3>Inspector of the Ministry of Education, Pang Jingzhou, Criticizes Lu Ping Medical School</h3>
<p>The Medical College of Pingda University Is Making Great Progress, While the Equipment of the Lu Medical College Is Simple</p>
<p>Liu Yingshi and Five Others Inspect Various Universities and Colleges in Tianjin</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) Liu Yingshi, Guo Youshou, Sun Guofeng, Chen Kezhong, Zhou Tianfang, and five other inspectors from the Ministry of Education arrived in Tianjin and began to inspect colleges and universities in Tianjin. Pang Jingzhou, a specialist in medical inspection, took the train to Baoding today (15th) at 12:00 noon to inspect the Hebei Provincial Medical College. The Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of National Colleges and Universities in Pingjin decided to entertain the inspectors from the Ministry of Education when they return to Peiping, and to make some suggestions. The details of the situation of each party are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Mr. Pang Jingzhou's Remarks</h3>
<p>Before Mr. Pang left Beiping, a reporter met Mr. Pang in the garden courtyard and inquired about his impressions of inspecting medical education. His reply was as follows: This trip to the north to inspect medical education has been quite pleasant. The Ministry of Education instructed me to inspect medical schools for two reasons: (1) Although some Ministry officials have studied medicine, they are busy with Ministry affairs and cannot leave Nanjing, so I was sent north; (2) Those who run education inevitably have some subjective views when inspecting medical schools. The Ministry of Education asked me to inspect medical schools in North China because of my independent nature. When I left Nanjing, the Ministry did not indicate inspection standards. However, I am responsible for specialized medical inspections. As for the inspection of administrative expenses of various medical schools, Mr. Sun (Guofeng) and Mr. Guo (Youshou) are responsible. Because I have business relationships in Shanghai, I am returning south early. Today, I am going to Baoding to inspect the Hebei Provincial Medical College. I plan to inspect for two days, then go to Kaifeng to inspect the Henan University Medical College for two days, and then take a train from Kaifeng to return south. During this inspection of various medical schools, I deeply felt that medicine is quite necessary in China. Each school has its own advantages and its own unique spirit. The Peiping Union Medical College, a private institution, has the most abundant funding. Although the college was founded by foreigners, it is registered with the Ministry of Education, so it must also be inspected. The National Peiping University Medical College has made rapid progress in recent years. Three years ago, when I traveled to Peiping, I visited the medical college. The situation at that time is still vivid in my mind. This time, each part of the college has made progress, especially the surgery and physical therapy departments. It is a pity that funding is difficult. After the college followed the Ministry of Education's order to change from a four-year system to a six-year system, funding has become even more strained. The Shandong Qilu University Medical College has a long history and complete equipment. The Shandong Provincial Medical College was established a year and a half ago. The school buildings are not sufficient, and the equipment is certainly not as good as that of Qilu University Medical College, but the spirit of hard work is very good. Running a medical school is more difficult than running other schools: (1) Medical schools are the most expensive. Medicine must be practiced, and practice must have affiliated hospitals. All equipment is more complicated than any other school; (2) Medical colleges must be close to society. Some people criticize the quality of medicine not by students' grades but by the simplicity of hospital equipment, because medical schools must have a kind of belief in society. I will return to Shanghai to sort out the report after all medical schools in various places have been inspected, he said.</p>
<h3>The Educational Association's Stance</h3>
<p>According to Yang Likui, a member of the Peiping-Tianjin University and College Educational Association, the Ministry of Education's dispatch of personnel to the north for inspection prompted some suggestions from the association. The equipment in various northern schools is simple, so it is necessary to suggest to the Ministry of Education to increase funding. Last year, the Ministry of Education merged various colleges and departments of Peiping University, causing disputes because the school was greatly affected. Please ask the Ministry of Education not to implement the merger policy again. The university graduation examination urgently needs to be improved in order to raise the level of various suggestions. When the Ministry of Education's inspection commissioner comes to Beiping again, the Educational Association will hold a meeting to receive him and offer opinions, he said.</p>
<h3>Inspecting the Medical College</h3>
<p>After Xu Songming, acting president of Peiping University, learned that the Ministry of Education's inspection commissioner was going to the hospital for inspection, he personally greeted them at the hospital at 8:00 a.m. on the 14th. At 8:50 a.m., the Ministry of Education's inspection commissioners Pang Jingzhou, Liu Yingshi, Chen Kezhong, Zhou Tianfang, Sun Guofeng, and Guo Youshou arrived at the medical college and were received by Xu Songming, Dean Wu Xiangfeng, and Secretary Ma Zhidao. They successively visited the basic teaching rooms, including physiology, pathology, anatomy, bacteriology, medicine, chemistry, and physiological chemistry law, eight medical teaching rooms. Next, they went to the affiliated hospital, accompanied by Xu and Wu, and were received by Jian Xianqi, the hospital director. They visited the clinical departments, including internal medicine, surgery, ophthalmology, dermatology, venereology, otolaryngology, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and physical therapy, eight departments. They also inspected the operating room and wards. Finally, they went to the Second District Health Office for inspection, also accompanied by Xu and Wu, and were received by health teacher Yan Jingqing. The inspectors inquired about the medical college's funding, and Dean Wu Xiangfeng replied that the monthly funding was 19,000 yuan, and the affiliated hospital's funding was more than 2,200 yuan. The inspectors recorded the information they obtained one by one, and left at about 2:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Liu and Others Go to Tianjin</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education's inspection commissioners Liu Yingshi, Sun Guofeng, Guo Youshou, Chen Kezhong, and Zhou Tianfang took a train to Tianjin at 6:00 p.m. on the 14th. Before leaving, the reporter interviewed Liu Yingshi, who said that tonight the five of them would go to Tianjin. Starting tomorrow, they would inspect Nankai University, Beiyang Institute of Technology, Hebei Institute of Technology, Women's Normal College, and the College of Law and Business day by day. After the inspection, they would return to Beiping to inspect Peking University, Normal University, and various colleges of Peiping University (excluding the medical college), Tsinghua University, North China College, China College, Chaoyang College, and the Republic of China College. After completing the inspection in Beiping, they would go to Baoding to inspect the Hebei Agricultural College, etc., and then go to Kaifeng, Wuhan, and Changsha, and then return to Nanjing via Wuhan and Anqing. Pang Jingzhou, who specializes in inspecting medical education, is scheduled to go to Baoding tomorrow (i.e., today) to inspect the Hebei Provincial Medical College. The Ministry of Education has sent personnel to various provinces for inspection. This time, the inspection is of universities and colleges in North China and Central China. Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces will also send personnel to inspect in the future. During this trip to Peiping, the Peiping University Medical College and the Union Medical College have complete equipment and conscientious coursework. As for detailed questions, I cannot answer because they belong to specialized nature and I do not study medicine, he said.</p>
<h3>Welcome at North China College</h3>
<p>North China College was originally registered with the Ministry of Education, but the registration was revoked last year for some reason. However, the college is still actively rectifying its internal affairs.</p>
<p>In the past year, there have been considerable achievements. When the Ministry of Education's inspection commissioner comes to Peiping for the second time, they will decide to go to North China College for inspection. An official letter had arrived at the college early. Yesterday (the 14th), the student union of the college posted various slogans welcoming the inspection commissioner. The meaning of the slogans was to hope that the inspectors would report to the Ministry of Education in detail after the inspection, it was said.</p>
<h3>The National Boy Scout Jamboree Is Unlikely to Be Held as Scheduled</h3>
<p>April 4th is difficult to achieve</p>
<p>The Boy Scouts of China once had a plan to hold a national Boy Scout jamboree on April 4th of this year, but it was not officially decided. Recently, it was heard that the event could not be realized on April 4th. One reason is that although the second Boy Scout registration has been carried out throughout the country, remote provinces have not been able to register on time. The incomplete registration affects the overall plan, and the financial aspect is also affected by the current difficulty in administrative operating expenses. March will pass in an instant, and it is feared that the saying that the camping will be on April 4th will also be too late to handle in terms of circumstances, and it will be postponed, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Orders an Investigation into the Trend of Private Middle Schools in Peiping Enrolling Transfer Students</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education ordered the commissioner inspecting higher education in Peiping to investigate the trend of private middle schools in Peiping enrolling transfer students for appropriate action.</p>
<h3>Students at the University of Bourgas Strike</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Sofia, 15th) Five thousand students at the University of Sofia in Bourgas declared a strike because the examination standards were too high. A melee broke out in the afternoon, and thirty people were injured. The school authorities now declared that classes would not resume and decided to close the university.</p>

<h3>All Sectors of the City Initiate the New Life Movement Promotion Association</h3>
<p>Students from Various Universities in the City Will Also Organize Jointly</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang launched the New Life Movement in Nanchang, various provinces and cities have responded one after another. This city is the center of national culture, and the complexity of its lifestyle and content is also the best in the country. In recent years, the habit of extravagance and decline has swept the country. Prosperous cities have become dens of sin. It is even more necessary to engage in the New Life Movement. A hundred or so people from all sectors of culture, education, and industry in the city, including Wang Xinming, Tao Baichuan, Xu Xingchu, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Zexiang, Tong Hangbai, Tang Zengyu, Chen Jicheng, Wu Kaixian, Wang Yansong, Lu Jingshi, Zhu Yingpeng, Xu Zejun, Xue Guangfen, Wu Zhiqian, Zhu Youhuan, Pan Yangyao, and Zhu Xuefan, initiated the organization of the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association. A temporary correspondence office was set up on the second floor of the Shanghai Bank in Ximen. In addition, more than 300 students from various universities in the city, including Guanghua Chen Guangpu, Soochow Ren Xianqun, Fudan Liu Shaorong, Jiaotong Gong Shaoxiong, Jinan Zhou Shifu, Daxia Zheng Jie, Law School Li Baiqing, Datong Sheng Peiquan, Jiangnan Liu Daozhang, Chung Hwa Wu Di, and Business School Hu Xiangwen, also jointly initiated the New Life Movement in order to promote the New Life Movement in various universities, engaged in the work of cell organization in various universities, and unified the steps of the New Life Movement in the academic world. A sponsors' meeting will be held in the near future to elect organizers and actively proceed.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Initiators The declaration issued by the association yesterday is as follows: The renewal of the form and spirit of life is the driving force of social evolution. The requirements of the environment and the times are the conditions that promote the transformation of the form and spirit of life. The current environment and the times do not allow us to stagnate in the middle of the old form and spirit of life. Can we hold on to the remnants and wait to be eliminated by natural selection? If not, then shouldn't we reform the form and spirit of life to adapt to this environment with its rugged roads and this era with its treacherous trends? Moreover, the great leader who leads us to the road of rejuvenation has shown us the way of the New Life and is carrying out a great and noble New Life Movement under his own example. We are determined to start our</p>
<p>New Life under the Leadership of Chairman Chiang To promote the spirit of our nation, raise our revolutionary enthusiasm, encourage our courage to rejuvenate, support our great leader, and work together with revolutionary comrades across the country to eliminate the remnants of the Communist bandits, eliminate feudal organizations, and complete the great cause of unification in order to restore the glory of our national history. All revolutionary people in Shanghai should mobilize together to cooperate with us. Our Shanghai is the largest city in China. Not only is the development of industry and commerce the best in the country, but also the development of cultural undertakings is above any city. However, when people mention Shanghai, they always think of it as a nest of prostitutes, a den of thieves, and a kingdom of gangsters. When they mention the lives of our Shanghai people, they always think that except for dough cakes, mahjong, whoring, hunting, eating big dishes, riding cars, going to dance halls, entering dog racing, buying champagne tickets, and playing poker cards, there is no life. Isn't this the Shanghai people's</p>
<p>Great Shame In fact, Shanghai has its dark side, and it also has its bright side. A part of Shanghai people is indeed a bit Westernized and a bit decadent. The Shanghai hooligans are the result of prostitution, but within ten steps, there must be fragrant grass, and in ten empty villages, there must be loyal people. The past history has long proved that Shanghai has become the birthplace of the National Revolution no matter when. A large part of the people in Shanghai are also the most loyal supporters of the Three Principles of the People. There is the former residence of the national father Sun Yat-sen, the Hushi Society entrusted by the spirit of Chen Yingshi, and the relics of the January 28 Anti-Japanese War. Aren't these all the glory of Shanghai and the people of Shanghai? Moreover, the spirit of the Xinhai Revolution, the courage of the Northern Expedition, the common feeling of years of suppressing the communists, and the sentiment of resisting Japan and saving the country are still like a rope connected to the 300,000-plus people in Shanghai. We can fully utilize this unfinished revolution to rejuvenate the nation. Okay, let's all move forward to the New Life now.</p>
<p>The Foundation of Governing the Country and Pacifying the World is Self-Cultivation It can be seen that traveling far must start from the near, and climbing high must start from the low, which is by no means deceiving. Guan Zhong said it well, "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four dimensions of a country. If the four dimensions are not stretched, the country will perish." If we want to save the country, we must first stretch our four dimensions. Only when the four dimensions can be tolerated can our nation become the highest moral group, have the possibility of uniting the entire nation into an organic body, and have the hope of rejuvenation. All citizens of Shanghai, please quickly gather under the banner of the New Life Movement and strive for the basic work of rejuvenating the nation.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Stipulates the Time for Primary School Gatherings</h3>
<p>The Primary School Joint Sports Meeting Will Be Held in Early April</p>
<p>The Arithmetic Competition Will Be Held in Early May</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday instructed the municipal and registered private primary schools, saying that the municipal Bide Primary School submitted a request to stipulate what kind of gatherings will be held this semester and to announce them in advance. After deliberation by the 281st bureau meeting, it was decided to hold the primary school joint sports meeting in early April, the arithmetic competition in early May, and the primary school health story competition in early June. In addition to the instructions, it is also urgently ordered to be informed of this order.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Radio Weekly</p>
<h3>Analysis of AC Radio Power Supply</h3>
<p>— Meng Cheng</p>
<p>The most difficult problem to solve in vacuum tube radios is the power supply. DC requires three sets of batteries, A, B, and C. Among them, the A and B batteries are the most problematic. The C battery is easier to solve because of its lower voltage and extremely small current. When using AC, the work assigned to the three sets of batteries will be taken over by two power lines. All power is taken from the power lines.</p>
<p>The AC radio power supply can be divided into four parts to explain:</p>
<p>(1) Power Transformer Ordinary power supplies are composed of two or more transformers. One transformer lowers the AC voltage of 220 or 110 volts on the power line to an appropriate filament voltage and directly connects it to the filament or hot wire on the vacuum tube to replace the A battery in a DC radio. Another transformer raises or lowers the voltage from the power line to the maximum required plate voltage. However, the voltage coming out of the transformer is AC voltage, and the B and C batteries in the radio must be DC voltage, so other components must be connected to convert this AC voltage into DC voltage.</p>
<p>(2) Rectifier A rectifier has unidirectional conductivity, meaning that current can only flow in one direction inside the rectifier and cannot flow in the opposite direction. Therefore, the function of the rectifier is to cut off half of the positive and negative time-varying AC voltage and convert it into a unidirectional pulsating voltage. There are many types of rectifiers. In radios, the most common is the application of diode vacuum tubes. There are so-called mercury rectifier tubes, which are also a type of diode, but a small amount of mercury is placed in them during manufacturing to increase the rectification efficiency. In high-power dynamic speakers, a low DC voltage must also be applied to increase its output power. This low DC voltage now uses a new type of copper oxide rectifier to take power directly from the AC voltage.</p>
<p>(3) Filter The plate and grid voltages required in radios are all fixed DC voltages. The pulsating voltage coming out of the rectifier, although DC, changes in voltage from time to time, gradually increasing from zero to the maximum and then gradually decreasing from the maximum to zero. Therefore, it is necessary to modify the pulsating voltage to a fixed voltage. The function of the filter is to reduce the range of the pulsating voltage to a minimum. The voltage coming out of the filter is almost fixed. The filter is composed of several fixed capacitors and several iron-core coils. The capacitor has a large capacitance and the ability to store electrons. When the voltage is extremely high, it temporarily stores the current, but when the voltage decreases, the current can still flow out. In this way, it can make up for the deficiency and reduce the voltage pulsation. The iron-core coil has a large self-inductance and opposes changes in current when the voltage increases or decreases. In other words, the iron-core coil also has the effect of maintaining a fixed voltage. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Structure and Principles of ABC Battery Eliminators</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>The power sources used in old-fashioned radios are mostly supplied by dry cells or storage batteries. Such power sources are neither convenient to carry nor easy to manage. New-style radios, with the addition of only a rectifier tube and a few small parts, can have an inexhaustible power supply. The recent popularization of wireless radios among the general public in China is truly due to the contribution of ABC battery eliminators (ELIMINATOR).</p>
<p>The structure and principles of commonly used ABC battery eliminators are as follows:</p>
<p>A-Battery Section</p>
<p>Because the use of the A-battery is only to heat the filament and emit electrons, both AC and DC power can be used. The A-battery commonly used in AC radios uses a transformer to reduce the external voltage (110 or 220V) before use. As shown in the figure, S1 is a 2.5V secondary coil, used to burn the filaments of the detector and amplifier tubes. S3 is the secondary coil of V5, dedicated to the filament of the rectifier tube. R is a 20-ohm center-tapped resistor (which must be directly connected to the tube socket when in use; please refer to issue 11 of this publication). Its function is to obtain a point where the filament potential value remains constant. The screen grid circuit (i.e., B and C-) is connected to this point to reduce AC hum. If you want to reduce AC hum to the minimum, then except for the final stage power output tube, it is best to use indirectly heated vacuum tubes for all the rest (INDIRECT HEATER TUBE).</p>
<p>B-Battery Section</p>
<p>The B-battery is applied to the plate and screen grid of the vacuum tube to absorb the electrons emitted from the filament. Because electrons are negatively charged, the plate and screen grid must be connected to a positive voltage to be effective. Also, because any change in the plate voltage can easily cause noise, the B-battery must use stable DC voltage.</p>
<p>Although the structure of B-battery eliminators varies, their principles are always based on the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) The plate voltage of new-style radios is as high as 250 volts or more. Therefore, the external voltage of 110 or 220 volts seems too low. Therefore, the first step is to increase the external voltage to the required value before it can be used. The transformer T and its secondary coil S2 are responsible for this mission (see figures A and B).</p>
<p>(2) The rectifier tube V1 uses the principle of like charges repel and opposite charges attract to convert the increased B voltage into a unidirectional pulsating current (as shown in figure C). This pulsating DC current cannot be directly applied to the plates of each vacuum tube for the time being, otherwise the loudspeaker will emit extremely loud buzzing noise, disrupting the correct sound.</p>
<p>(3) The function of the filter is to convert the rectified pulsating current into a smooth DC current. We know that the choke coil has a very large magnetic inductance (commonly 30 Henrys. If there is an electric loudspeaker, its magnetic field coil can be used as a choke coil).</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very difficult for it to pass pulsating current. However, the function of the capacitor is the opposite. The fluctuating pulsating current, since there is no way to go for the time being, can only rest in the capacitor for a while before slowly passing through the choke coil. As a result, a stable DC current can be obtained at point D.</p>
<p>(4) If only one type of B voltage is needed in the radio, then the work of the B-battery eliminator can end here. But in fact, the radio must have various different B voltages in order to supply the detector, oscillator, and amplifier tubes. Therefore, it must go through a voltage dividing procedure before it can be completed.</p>
<p>Various B voltages of different levels are reduced by using resistors connected in series in the plate circuit. As shown in the figure, if the amplifier tube V5 needs a plate voltage of 180V, according to Ohm's law, RI = ohm. Also, if the detector tube V2 needs a plate voltage of 45V, we get</p>
<p>ohm</p>
<p>C-Battery Section</p>
<p>The C-battery is connected to the grid of the amplifier tube to prevent distortion during amplification. What is needed is a negative voltage with a constant value. Usually, a section of resistor is used to connect between the filament center-tap resistor (or cathode) and B- to complete the circuit. As shown in the figure, V4 is a type 47 pentode amplifier tube. When the plate voltage is 250V, the required C voltage is -6.5V. According to Ohm's law, we get R = 450 ohms. Similarly, we get R3 = = 2700 ohms. Those connected in parallel with R3 and R4 are IMF fixed capacitors, whose function is to allow low-frequency current to pass easily and improve the sound quality of vacuum tube amplification.</p>
<h3>Various Rectifier Tubes</h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>Since the prevalence of AC radios, rectifier tubes have replaced the work of B and C batteries, supplying plate and grid voltages. The rectifier tube is originally a diode, using the "Edison effect" to convert AC power into half-wave or full-wave DC power. Connected with resistors to adjust the appropriate voltage, it is applied to the radio. Compared with using batteries, the procedure is convenient and economical. Therefore, rectifier tubes can be improved and evolved with the needs of the times along with other types of vacuum tubes in radios. Now, I will briefly describe the characteristics and effects of various types.</p>
<p>The 80 full-wave rectifier tube used to be the most suitable rectifier tube. It is very suitable for supplying power to four-tube or seven-tube radios. It can also be used for half-wave rectification. When using it, connect the two plates in parallel, then the output current can be slightly increased compared to when doing full-wave rectification. The characteristics of this tube are: filament voltage is 5 volts, filament current is 2 amps, plate voltage is 350-550 volts, plate current is 125-135 milliamps.</p>
<p>The 81 half-wave rectifier tube has a filament voltage of 7.5 volts, a filament current of 1.25 amps, a plate voltage of 700 volts, and a plate current of 85 milliamps. Because the output voltage of this rectifier tube is very high, the filter setting is slightly more expensive, and it is rarely used in ordinary radios. If two of these tubes are used, they can be used for full-wave rectification (the wiring diagram is simplified due to space limitations).</p>
<p>82 full-wave mercury vapor rectifier (FULL WAVE MERCURY VAPOR RECTIFIER) is an advanced micro-quantity of mercury. When in use, the mercury is evaporated, and the tube is filled with mercury atoms. Ions with positive charges neutralize the negative electrons repelled between the filament and the plate, so as to increase the total number of electrons and strengthen the rectification effect. The voltage drop in this type of rectifier tube is only 15 volts. When using this tube, each of the two plates must be connected in series with a high-frequency choke coil, and the tube should be isolated with a nickel cover to avoid chaotic AC noise caused by rectification changes on the radio, and can increase its sensitivity. Because the internal resistance of this tube is very low, special attention must be paid when using it to prevent its load from exceeding 50%, otherwise the filament will be easily damaged. The characteristics of this tube are: filament voltage is 2.5 volts, filament current is 3 amps, plate voltage is 500 volts, and plate current is 125 milliamps. This tube is commonly used in new-style radios.</p>
<p>83.523. The characteristics and effects of the full-wave mercury vapor rectifier tube are almost the same as those of the 82 tube, but the filament voltage is 5 volts and the plate current is 500 milliamps, which is twice that of the 82 tube. In today's seven-tube radios and above, it should replace the 8081 tube.</p>
<p>84 indirectly heated full-wave rectifier tube. This tube is specially used in car radios. The filament power supply can be DC or AC. Its characteristics are: filament voltage is 6.3 volts, filament current is 0.5 amps, plate voltage is 225 volts, and plate current is 50 milliamps.</p>
<p>2525 indirectly heated voltage doubler rectifier tube. This tube is specifically used for AC/DC dual-purpose radios or transformerless radios. There are two ways to connect it. If the radio is for both AC and DC, it can be connected in a half-wave mode; if it is only used for AC, it can be connected to a voltage doubler. In other words, it converts AC voltage into twice the DC voltage. The principle and connection method for its voltage doubler function will be described later when there is time. For the characteristics of this tube, please refer to my article "Introduction to the 25Z5 New Vacuum Tube", published in issue 23 of this publication. This tube is widely used and is used as a rectifier in today's AC/DC dual-purpose radios.</p>
<p>12Z3 indirectly heated half-wave rectifier tube. The filament voltage is 12.6 volts, the filament current is 3 amps, the plate voltage is 230 volts, and the plate current is 60 milliamps. This tube is also commonly used in AC/DC dual-purpose radios.</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on the Beijing School, the Shanghai School, and Others</h3>
<p>— Gu Ming</p>
<p>Some time ago, when the "Beijing-Shanghai" issue was most discussed, I briefly discussed the lack of good literary works, and thus thought of the increasingly deteriorating and difficult material environment, where there are no talents of any kind, not only literary ones. However, the South, due to the natural environment, still has a few people who are writing, etc. At the same time, a certain gentleman strongly opposed this, thinking that literature has nothing to do with nature, and that Russia, despite its extremely difficult material environment, still had Pushkin, etc. That theory is also very valuable, because in our current situation, Pushkin should emerge even more, which can be a stepping stone for modern writers to encourage themselves. That's right. But all geniuses, celestial beings, talents, ghosts, whether literary, philosophical, natural scientific, or social scientific, must be found among humanity. Since they are in this society, they must be dominated by the material environment, which is also knowable. Have you ever seen an uneducated rickshaw puller write poetry, or someone who doesn't know English read Shakespeare's original works? There's no way to imagine it, that's the fact. Pushkin had to understand Russian first to write poetry; he also had a melancholy dark night and a vast sky on his head, which were imprinted in his poems—it's really not a strange reason.</p>
<p>The Eastern Victory Divine Continent has become more and more "barren and poor" recently, which is also a fact. "Abundant products" and "fertile land" have long become deceptive and self-deceptive talk. To grow peonies in rubble, to pick big Sterculia monosperma fruits in the weeds, is also an impossible fact except with the magic of Brahmins. A certain gentleman hopes that Pushkin will emerge from this, which is well-intentioned, but if there were geniuses like Pushkin, whether a hundred or a thousand, they might have already turned into something else due to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>The lack of genius, the scarcity of works, both spirit and material have become complete poverty. A few small soldiers and petty thieves are wildly praising and cheering in the literary world, greatly dividing it into "Beijing" and "Shanghai." Unable to name it, I name it "wild fox Zen." It is knowable how ridiculous the theory is when a wild fox talks about Zen principles. If one's ambition is a small chicken or a wild rabbit, and one declares "I am a vegetarian" or "I am frank," how much worse is that! Many people want to get rich and live forever in the literary world, which is no different from this. There are more foxes but fewer Zen foxes in the North, and fewer foxes but more Zen foxes in the South. Just looking at those people talking about the classification of literature or the methods of writing poetry, with the audience all being young people, one can vaguely see one or two aspects of fox Zen. —</p>
<h3>Strolling Through the Confucian Temple (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Bai Ge</p>
<p>The Dacheng Hall is already very old, and everything shows a haggard and trembling appearance, only the ten dragon pillars in front are particularly majestic and moving. It is said that these dragon pillars are among the first or second best in China, and they have a very important place in the history of Chinese stone carvings. I don't understand art, but when I see them, I just want to spiral up to them and shout three times. Modern gold-worshipping art has suffocated us so much that we can't even breathe! In front is a plaza paved with bricks and tiles. Those bricks and tiles, as long as you peck them with something, the pecked area will be soaked. It is said that they are from the Han Dynasty, so they are called Han bricks. But one thing is laughable, that is, the person leading the way must enthusiastically explain to you that the bricks and tiles sweat, so they are called sweating bricks. This is only for geologists to study, it's none of our business. Inside the hall, naturally sitting in the center is Confucius, and on both sides are the Four Associates and the Ten Philosophers as usual. The scepter held by Confucius is really unsuitable. It is said that it was originally made of green jade, but later the Confucius Mansion replaced it with the current one, fearing that it would be stolen. Turning out to the left, there are a few stone railings that can provide us with a little legend. Once Qianlong came here, patted these railings with his hand, and they made a clanging sound. When he reached the third one, Qianlong told a joke, "Dare you ring again," so the following ones didn't ring. Although this is a laughable legend, it is indeed more interesting to go and pat those railings after knowing this legend. Every time I pass by there, I have to pat them a few times.</p>
<p>Behind it is the Sleeping Hall, which is brilliant and dazzling, and all the steps, walls, tiles, and stones are brand new, unlike the dilapidated scene of the Dacheng Hall.</p>
<h3>Xiang Lake in Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>— Tang Kun</p>
<p>Once across the Qiantang River, the first county is Xiaoshan; in the west gate of this county, there is Xiang Lake. Although it is not as famous at home and abroad as West Lake, some places are more lovable than West Lake.</p>
<p>Xiang Lake is not like West Lake's "gaudy and heavily adorned," she has a simple and ancient style. We can say that West Lake is a charming noblewoman, while Xiang Lake is a graceful village girl. In West Lake, at a glance, it is all red and green colors, which makes people feel too vulgar; as for Xiang Lake? At a glance, in spring and summer, it is an endless expanse of water, with rippling tiny waves, and the banks are lush with leaves, dense shadows, reflected in the lake, as if constantly following the circles of water patterns spreading out, but in fact they are still. Among the green leaves, some bamboo fences and thatched cottages are occasionally revealed, and sometimes a long cock-a-doodle-doo or a dog bark is heard. Suddenly, a woman fetching water runs to the lakeside to fetch water, and the calm lake surface is broken. Deep in the misty waves, there may be a simple little boat, floating lonely. In autumn and winter, the lake changes into a clear and pale garment. The lake shore is full of sparse branches, leaving no dead leaves. Girls blowing water caltrop reeds glide in small boats, singing tunes in the lake casually. Most of the people living by the lake make a living by burning kilns. Every time the sun sets in the west, wisps of kiln smoke sway in the air, and the wild birds flying up and down in the lake become the best scenery in the lake. The left bank of the lake is a high and low mountain peak, with white clouds undulating, which makes people imagine. In the middle of the lake, several small islets protrude from the water surface; with miscellaneous trees and a residence for one or two water birds on them. Dingshan Mountain, Yilan Pavilion, Yahu Mountain, etc., are all secluded scenic spots in the lake. The campus of the Xiang Lake Rural Normal School of Zhejiang Province is built on Dingshan Mountain, surrounded by ten thousand bamboos, making it even more majestic and quiet. It is truly the most beautiful place in Xiang Lake. In recent years, people who admire the name of Xiang Lake and come from afar to visit are more and more every day. In the near future, Xiang Lake may become as famous as West Lake.</p>
<h3>The Old Village Warden</h3>
<p>— Huanming</p>
<p>That white-haired, trembling-lipped old village warden was the first visitor I saw after I got home. He walked into the door very humbly, opened his inkstone on the table in the hall, and lifted his pen, shaking it on a gray-white piece of paper...</p>
<p>"What... what is your name, how old are you?"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, Afa, I see you coming to investigate the household registration all day long," my mother said, "Investigating the household registration all day long, it's really ghostly. I haven't seen a report on the population statistics in the county. You just write some names and ages, seventy or eighty, on your own." "Oh, oh, yes, yes, Madam," he scribbled a name on that "Household Registration Inspection License": "I'll stick it on the door for you, I..."</p>
<p>After sticking it on, he took a small fee and left. Not even half a month after living there, the old village warden came again. He was humming, his eyes were dull, he was leaning on a door bolt with his right hand, and his face was very ugly - he was sick. The things he brought were still the same as last time, inkstone, pen, a roll of household registration inspection license paper. He opened the inkstone uneasily, shaking his hands: "What... what is your name, how old are you?"</p>
<p>"Are you going to inspect the household registration again? This... is really serious, too serious, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"This is the order from "above"... "Above" ordered us to inspect like this..."</p>
<p>"Is there an official document? - This handling fee is too unreasonable!"</p>
<p>He uneasily, barely smiling, mumbled; "Didn't bring it - forgot to bring it..."</p>
<p>"I have been abroad for many years, and I have never encountered this kind of serious investigation - even foreign countries don't have it, and they don't need handling fees..." I said suddenly... "This is your village warden's "extra income," isn't it!"</p>
<p>His eyes showed a pitiful light... " - Don't call me village warden, I am a village policeman. Yes, yes, the village policeman is the village warden... Hahaha..."</p>
<p>"Is it "extra income?"" I asked closely.</p>
<p>He was embarrassed and coughed for a while, trembling his lips... "To tell you the truth, the village policeman has no salary, right? Hahaha - The amount is limited, you, rich people, don't care, hahaha!"</p>
<p>After taking the money, he picked up the inkstone and wanted to leave. He paused and said... "Thank you, we "haven't" people really have no way, we're old, a "bachelor," and when we're sick, we have to ask you to help, without support - to tell you the truth, the village policeman has no salary."</p>
<p>The day before New Year's Eve, I had to leave home. Following my luggage out the door, I found the old village warden leaning on the door bolt and walking up the threshold of my house again. The things he brought were still the same as last time, inkstone, pen, that roll of gray-white paper, probably still the household registration inspection license paper, right?</p>
<h3>About "The Sinister Black Hand"</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Ke Jia's "The Sinister Black Hand" was published in the New Year's issue of "Literature." It is a relatively long poem. Compared with the poems in "Brand," it is a big step forward.</p>
<p>From this poem, it seems that Zang Kejia is gradually trying to get rid of his "small self" and striving to shift from personal description to social description, to find the themes of his poems from the larger society.</p>
<p>In "The Sinister Black Hand," Zang Kejia describes the shield and spear contained in the construction of the church in the city. His purpose is to expose the sins of the church. He noticed the two aspects: the situation of the churchgoers who come to worship and the situation of the coolies who built the church. In one place, under the rule of one God, there are two different worlds. Being both "sons of God," why are some people like this and some people like that? So, in the end, he imagined the rebellion of the slaves and predicted that "then this church will become their dining room or bedroom." Here is revealed the demand of the liberals, revealing the anti-religious sentiment. He can expose the point that the great powers invaded China by using religion as a weapon to anesthetize the Chinese people ( ) This is indeed worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Religion, this thing, really does not know how much sin it has created. Thinking of the situation of the church in Europe in the Middle Ages, one can only add the words "unspeakable" to its sins. The work of progressive people for hundreds of years has failed to drive it out of European society, and when it comes to the time of competing for colonies, the invaders use religion to give the untouchables anesthetic injections. On this land of China, how many countless sins has it committed! Think about the situation before the "Boxer Rebellion," which would make one's hair stand on end. Since the May Fourth Movement, the anti-religious movement has flourished for a few years, but now this movement seems to be "sluggish." It seems that everyone is looking at the big picture, and few people are willing to start with the small things. Zang Kejia can catch this topic of religious aggression, even if the expression is not enough, it is worth recommending.</p>
<p>This relatively large theme made him adopt the form of a long poem. It made him quite abandon his narrow philosophy. This is a more advanced place than the poems in "Brand." Later, if he further recognizes the society, he will naturally not be wrong. And this method of seeking great materials in ordinary real life, I think, is also what other poets should learn. (To be continued)</p>

<p>There is a lonely fox, on the stone bridge of that Qi River. I can't help but worry for him in my heart, that man has no trousers on!</p>

<h3>Dusk (7)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>The scenery in the moonlight is solemn, and they sit there peacefully, breathing the fresh air. Suddenly, there was the sound of an iron gate being opened, the car horn broke the silence, and the dogs were barking noisily. All this made their brains feel painful like poison, and Qingzhi immediately stood up and closed the window.</p>
<p>"It's probably another banquet."</p>
<p>"Who knows, it's always these annoying things!"</p>
<p>After they said these two sentences, they fell silent again, only the pendulum of the wall clock was ringing evenly.</p>
<p>The door was suddenly pushed open, and the maid's voice was saying...</p>
<p>"Are the young ladies in the room? Why are you sitting in the dark? Do you know, the third young lady is back."</p>
<p>"Is she back from Nanjing? She didn't even write a letter."</p>
<p>"That's it, and she brought two children with her."</p>
<p>"Oh, then let's go downstairs to see her." Qingsong said to Qingzhi.</p>
<p>"No need, the third young lady said she'll come to see you later."</p>
<p>"Then turn on the lights first."</p>
<p>The lights were on, they stood up, straightened their crumpled clothes, and ordered the maid to make some light tea.</p>
<p>After a burst of messy, fine footsteps, Qingbai led in six-year-old Lingling and four-year-old Luer.</p>
<p>"Hello, sisters. Stand still and bow to your aunts." Qingbai ordered the two children after bowing to them. The well-behaved children didn't have any shyness and did as she said generously.</p>
<p>They had already stood up, showing long-unseen smiles to welcome them, and walked over happily to shake the children's hands.</p>
<p>"Hello, you, when did you arrive?"</p>
<p>"I just came after getting off the train," Qingbai was still so lively, letting go of one hand holding the children, and brushing her hair, "Sisters, please sit down."</p>
<p>"Then let's all sit down."</p>
<p>Qingbai was wearing a purple dress, tailored very fashionably. Although she had given birth to two children, she still had a very slender figure. Her face was painted with rouge and powder. Although it was said that she was already twenty-eight years old, she looked only about twenty-three or twenty-four years old.</p>
<p>"This time, what made you think of coming back?"</p>
<p>"If it were up to him, he probably wouldn't want me to come back in this lifetime," Qingbai showed a little happy sigh, "It just so happened that he was going to Yunnan for business, so naturally I couldn't follow him, so I took this opportunity to come back."</p>
<p>"In the blink of an eye, we haven't seen each other for five years!"</p>

<h3>Financial Gold and Silver Case Suddenly Hit, Gold Market Soars</h3>
<p>Guangdong Merchants Buy More Than Forty Ingots, Up 17.6 Yuan</p>
<p>Remaining Chips Are Limited, Bulls Panic and Premium Falls Severely</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market soared due to the sudden obstruction of the American silver case, which caused a sharp drop in silver futures and dealt a heavy blow to the shorts. Although there was a pullback in the middle, the Guangdong merchants vigorously purchased four to five thousand ingots, and the market situation surged. In the early morning, the overseas silver market in both Britain and the United States fell, and the base price was extremely good. The forward silver price at the Five Metals Exchange shrank by 1.5 to 1.7 percent. The exchange rate dropped slightly, London raw gold rose by 2 pence, American cotton rose slightly, and American wheat shrank by 1.25 percent.国民社(Guomin She) claimed that the US Treasury Secretary told the House Currency Committee that he opposed all current silver proposals, and the opening price rose to over 60 yuan. If the swap premium was added, the price soared by more than 20 yuan. Subsequently, Reuters claimed that US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told several members of the House Coinage Committee that he did not urgently need any bills and could not accept and implement them, and the price rose to 62-63 yuan. Afterwards, although news came that the US Treasury Department had exchanged new bonds worth 460,000,000 yuan, it only hovered for a while. After the opening, the banks unanimously pushed out, the domestic market hardened and fell, but the Guangdong merchants came to buy vigorously, and "Sheng Da Yuqing Yongheng Xing, etc." in the market re-purchased, and the gold price and exchange rate both tended to be strong. The subsequent market rose slightly, and after entering, the Bombay report shrank, and the exchange rate continued to tighten and stabilize. The March gold standard also rose, and the premium for the capturing period was almost non-existent for the April period. The central route was stagnant, and if the spot goods continued to come, it would be unimaginable. Therefore, bulls such as Yuan Maoyong cut prices and dropped out, and the lowest price was once one yuan. The sound of flat closing in the market suddenly increased, and the trend was unfavorable. The price of pure gold was 975 yuan. The market situation of the day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 960 yuan and 5 jiao. If the swap opening of 7 yuan is added, it is equivalent to an increase of more than 29 yuan from the previous closing. The item opened at 0.3 yuan, and the exchange rate in the morning opened at a recent selling price of 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 625 for the British exchange, and 34 yuan and 625 for the US exchange. The exchange rate tended to loosen, retreating from 0.7 jiao to 59 yuan. Zhifeng, Yongyuan Maoyong, Qianchang, Xiangdacheng, Fuyu, Hengxing, Ruikang, Zhengchang, Yuanchun, Xiexing, Yongheng, Xingyuan, etc. in the market sold vigorously, and the domestic market hardened. Shanghai pushed out July US dollars at 125, retreating to 56 yuan and 1 jiao. At this time, it was initially reported that HSBC's listing only reduced the British exchange by 125 and the US exchange by 25. Subsequently, the report was re-reported that the British exchange shrank by 25 and the US exchange fell by half a yuan, and the people's hearts were boosted. Dafa, Yongheng, Taiyicheng, Bingxing all entered, rising back to 7 yuan and 9 jiao. After entering, although Sheng Da entered, Mitsui 　　 June US dollars 0625, Hengxing Daxing Yongda Dacheng Zhifeng Yongqian Changxiang all sold, and fell again to 5 yuan and 8 jiao. Guang 　 Sheng Da 　　 No 　 Yi 　 Yida Shuiyu 　 Shui 　　　　　　　　 reported back good, Guangdong merchants vigorously pushed up the US dollar, and the domestic market gradually tightened. Sheng Da Heng and in the market kept buying, and then rose to 60 yuan and was slightly tired. Later, Shanghai came out with June US dollars at 875, and Yuqing Yong Zhifeng Yongda Dacheng Zhaofeng Chang sold them one after another to the downstream. 比利時銀行(Hua Bi)塞(Se) April US dollars at 6875, Yifeng Yongfu Chang, etc. sold them within 8 yuan. The noon closing was 958 yuan, and the item was sold at 7 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 957 yuan and 9 jiao, and the item opened at 7 yuan and 8 jiao. Qianchang Xiangchangsheng slightly sold, dropping to 7 yuan and 4 jiao. Mitsui ate June US dollars at 35 yuan, and Dalian merchants and Yuan Maoyong Yuan Maoyong Zhifeng Yongcui Taiheng Yuyuanheng all entered. Bombay fell by 16 anna, rising to 8 yuan and 7 jiao. Daxing Yongfu Yu once sold, and there was still hovering. Later, Hengxing Shengda Yida Yong and others vigorously entered, and the exchange rate also tightened, rising to 60 yuan. The bank pushed out June US dollars at 875, and the price hovered. Qianchang repeatedly supplied ingots, and Hengyu also sold. Shanghai pushed out July US dollars at 9375, gradually retreating to 8 yuan and 4 jiao. Hengxing's purchase limit was not obtained, and the closing price rose to 958 yuan and 9 jiao. The item was sold at 9 yuan, and the market was stable after closing. It was found that the highest price in one day was 960 yuan and 7 jiao, and the lowest price was 955 yuan and 8 jiao, with a difference of 4 yuan and 9 jiao. As a result, the closing price rose (plus swap of 7 yuan) by 17 yuan and 6 jiao compared with the previous closing.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 34 yuan and 25 due to HSBC's listing of US exchange rate falling by half a yuan, which is equivalent to a standard gold price of more than 1,010 yuan. According to the closing price, it is about 51 yuan, which is 4 yuan more than the previous closing. The settlement price for March was a reduction of 25 for the first shilling, which is 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 125. The exchange rate is equivalent to a standard gold price of more than 716 yuan. According to the closing price, it is about 7 yuan, which is about 5 yuan more than the previous closing. The book entry for this month is 709 yuan, April 959 yuan, May 958 yuan, the morning water replenishment is 709 yuan, and the afternoon price is the same. The price of pure gold is 975 yuan. The trading in the market is still active, and Yingfeng Heng, etc. in the same industry sold to Tianjin merchants at 15.5 to 13 yuan, and 3,400 taels were traded. However, there are merchants who have a buying appetite in the same industry. The price of 998 purity has been done at 18 yuan, and the price of 993 purity has been done at 14 yuan. This is what 慎誠(Shen Cheng) sold. At the beginning of the swap this term, Richang Ruikang paid Yuan Maoyong 4 yuan, and Yuan Maoyong dropped it down to 3.5 yuan, and Fuyu posted 3 yuan in the market, and then slightly rose to 4 yuan. After entering, Yuan Maoyong Yida Yuanchun Yuan Fuyu, etc. posted one after another. Although Hengxing was posting out, it still retreated to within 3 yuan. The bulls were quite panicked, and at noon it retreated to within 2 yuan. The air in the market was still bad, and there was a tendency to flatten out, but there was no transaction. The formal transaction was done between 1.5 and 2 yuan. Zhifeng Yongda Dacheng, etc. all posted out. Yingfeng Heng posted 21 ingots to Fuyu, for 1 yuan. Finally, the shorts posted about 1.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The March price opened at 708 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan from the previous closing. This price was sold by Chengkang Hengchang Yong to Yuan Maoyong for 35 ingots. After entering, Hengyu and Wanxing all wanted it and reported an increase. Then Tianfeng sold 42 ingots to Wanxing and 28 ingots to Hengyu, and it rose to 710 yuan. At noon, Huixiang sold 7 ingots to Hengyu, retreating to 09 yuan, and the noon closing was 709 yuan. There was a lack of considerable opponents in the afternoon market, so it was always difficult to have a formal transaction. According to the previous market, the highest price in one day was 710 yuan and the lowest price was 708 yuan, with an increase and decrease of 2 yuan. As a result, the closing price rose by 6 yuan from the previous closing. The number of March strips was 19,320, and the number of April strips was 3,220.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was lively. Sheng Da Hengxing Yu Yongqing Sida Tongchun Shunmao Dachang Xianghongxing Yida Yongheng Xingyuan Changsheng Yong Bingxing Yuanheng, etc. were in the buying party, and Hengchang Yong Hengyu Huixiang Dada Dacheng Yifeng Yongqian Changxiang Hengtai Dafa Yong Tongfu Futai Heng Yuanmaoyong Shunli Wanxing Ruikang, etc. were in the selling party.

Dalian merchants and Wanxing altogether did more than 2,300 strips, with more than 900 strips netted out. Shunli altogether did more than 1,500 strips, with more than 900 strips netted out. Guangdong merchants Sheng Da entered more than 3,000 strips, and there were also many purchases on behalf of other numbers. In the afternoon market, each entered and exited more than 100 strips. Hengxing entered more than 1,000 strips and exited more than 500 strips. The number of May chips as of today is 18,186 strips, with a total of 40 bulls and 54 shorts. The total number of transactions on the day was 53,578 strips in the morning and 17,983 strips in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Silver Market Plummets, Foreign Exchange Shrinks, and the Wind Is Terrible</h3>
<p>—Chinese Merchants Vigorously Push Up US Exchange by More Than One Million Yuan—</p>
<p>According to foreign telegrams yesterday, the London big strip was nearly flat and then shrank by 0625, the American silver shrank by 875, the forward silver price fell sharply by 1.5 points, the British to the American and the American to the British each shrank by 25, the British to the French shrank by 7 pounds, the American to the French increased by 25, the private telegram silver price shrank by 1.4375, and the exchange rate decreased by 25. The US Treasury Secretary had a theory against all silver proposals in the Senate, and the people's hearts were greatly boosted.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Opens at Two Percent Interest Rate Yesterday</h3>
<p>—First Time Since the Opening After the Lunar New Year—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of foreign exchange in the market suddenly had a two-percent interest rate in the morning and afternoon markets, which was the first time to have an interest-bearing day after the opening during the Lunar New Year this year. However, judging from the situation of all aspects and the business situation, there is still no movement, and the head position is as loose and stagnant as before. Therefore, the clearing head is still a white clearing without adding water, and the transaction of exchange tickets is less active. More than 4.3 million was transferred in the morning market, more than 400,000 was newly traded, and more than 200,000 was traded in the afternoon market. More than 500,000 were traded in the small general meeting. Due to the current poor market conditions for foreign mortgage transactions, the financial sector selects and picks strictly for cargo deductions, so the resulting transactions are not many. Yesterday, the new transactions were still only 600,000 to 700,000, and the number of face-taking redemptions was 700,000 to 800,000. More than 1.3 million banknotes were recovered and issued, and the number of customers coming and going was 250,000. Bank collections and settlements: foreign banks collected and settled more than 1.4 million bills, and collected and settled various cargo exchange bills and mortgage payments of 4.7 to 8 million. 400,000 entered the warehouse. Chinese banks collected and settled more than 2.3 million bills, and collected and settled various cargo exchange tax mortgage payments of 4.2 million. 400,000 entered the warehouse. Japanese banks collected more than 1 million bills, and settled 700,000 to 800,000 bills. 3.4 million miscellaneous cargo exchanges were collected and settled, and 400,000 entered the warehouse. The foreign public bills of Qianzhuang were collected and settled for more than 32 million, and the foreign clearing head was collected and settled for 4.5 million. 400,000 foreign exchanges were collected, and 400,000 was collected in cash. In addition, the total number of exchanges in the bill exchange office of this city on the 16th was 7,400,000 yuan, 5,332 yuan, 9 jiao and 9 fen, including 4,357,406 yuan and 01 fen, and 3,047,926 yuan, 9 jiao and 8 fen.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Corners Slightly Up, Guangdong Corners Drop Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the small foreign currency in Jiangnan was 815 yuan in the morning market, which was 5 yuan better than the previous day. The afternoon market was the same as the Fu market. The number of transactions made was 6,500 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The small foreign currency in Guangdong Fu market was 756 yuan, which was 3 yuan less than the previous day. The afternoon market fell another 1.5 yuan, which was 754 yuan and 5 jiao. As a result, the total of the two markets was 4 yuan and 5 jiao less. The number of transactions made was 60,000 jiao in the morning market and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins did not move, and were still 320,500 wen. The number of transactions made was 33,332 shen, and the estimated price was 10,400 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities Shorts' Walls Shake, Bond Market Opens Up from Dullness</h3>
<p>New High Prices Are Found for 19 Shan and Others</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange gradually fluctuated. After more than ten days of hovering and brewing, the dull and stagnant situation suddenly opened up, and there was a feeling of sudden enlightenment. The multi-party and short-party have been in a stalemate for a long time, and at this time, the short-party's walls suddenly shook. It is because the March futures are getting closer to delivery, and the large number of floating shorts have to be closed early to avoid the pain of temporary squeeze. Judging from its past trends, although the hovering date is long, the market price has not fallen, and the bulls have a clear advantage. Therefore, although there is no favorable news for the bulls in the environment, the shorts are forced to drop the period due to the relationship between the supply and demand of chips, which makes the market price see new high prices from the extremely dull situation. In the first two rounds of the morning, the situation was extremely strong, and No. 5 and No. 59 were bought very enthusiastically. Although No. 16 was sold, it was still seen that demand exceeded supply, so each round had an increase of 5 fen to 2 jiao. Although the number is small, the trend is consistent. Alert retail short-sellers rushed to make up again in the afternoon, and No. 17 was also bought quite enthusiastically. The drop-in transactions of various gangs were also quite lively, so the rising trend did not weaken in the afternoon, and each round continued to rise by 3, 4, and 5 jiao. However, the closing price of the 22-year customs was only 1 or 2 jiao smaller, which is also irrelevant to the overall difference. In total, 19 Shan, 20 Volume 20 Customs, and Unified Salt Tax all found new high prices. The salt tax of 53 yuan has been hovering for more than ten times, and those who failed to break through are now seeing a breakthrough. The popularity has suddenly increased, and the future may continue to rise. The market price result is an increase of 2, 3 jiao to 6, 7 jiao. The total transaction fee is 11,206,200 yuan, including 6,200 yuan for spot and 11,200,000 yuan for futures. The comparison table of the high and low increases and decreases is listed below (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan)</p>

<h3>New York Silver Mine Stocks Plunge Fiercely</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported on the 15th that the New York stock market plunged fiercely in silver mine and other stocks due to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's opposition to the current actions on silver. The silver price once fell by 2 points, and the huge plunge created a new record for this year. United States Metallurgical (silver stock leader) plummeted 9 yuan, and all stocks were affected and fell unanimously. In the end, the government proposed to allow Cuba to import liquor without restrictions, and the market recovered slightly due to the relationship between multi-party and short-party chips. In the small exchange, mine stocks fell out, power plant stocks were settled, the market was also tired, and bonds were mixed. Highly speculative bonds had been rising for several days, and the bulls came out very enthusiastically. The total transaction volume for the day was 1.34 million shares. (Wheat) The bulls slightly sold, and the spot demand was very good. The weather in the wheat producing area was too early. (Cotton) The Treasury Department's opposition to silver legislation caused the inflationists to be very frustrated. The朋克海案 (Pengke Hai Case) may be passed in the House of Representatives tomorrow and then sent to the Senate. There is a possibility of increased consumption of American cotton abroad, so it will affect the forward market. The futures market is calm. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>30 Industrial Stocks 102.2 Down 1.33</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 48.86 Down 0.95</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flower Biao Yarn Bulls and Shorts Are Evenly Matched</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, and the situation was still strong. Because the number of transactions between the two parties was too large, the factory decided to implement a reduction in work from June 1, so a certain factory absorbed a large amount of additional amount and decided to take delivery. However, the general retail investors are worried about the sluggish actual sales, and the idea of short selling has not been cut off. Therefore, the fighting power of the multi-party and short-party is extremely strong.</p>
<h3>Biao Yarn Decreased in the Morning and Returned in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Biao Yarn pre-market, the selling households were active due to the false rumor that British and Japanese factories had opened cotton yarn, and each fell by 5, 6, 7, 8 jiao to 1 yuan. The market in the afternoon suddenly withered, and the multi-party closed and did not let go, and the market atmosphere became tighter. Each month rose by 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 jiao to 1 yuan and 2 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 33,900 packages. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,550 packages, Senkang 1,400 packages, Yuande 1,200 packages, Changfeng 1,700 packages, Dachang 650 packages, and Dafu 700 packages. Zhenda bought 1,050 packages, Dachang 700 packages, Chunji 700 packages, Jin 650 packages, Taichang 800 packages, and Renfeng 500 packages.

<h3>Biao Flower's Future Market Is Very Good</h3>
<p>The cotton market was flat in the morning and rose sharply in the afternoon. The US cotton market price did not move, but the exchange rate tended to shrink, resulting in an increase in the calculated price. At the same time, Yimian had good news, so the buying trend rose slightly, and the market rose accordingly. The sales of existing cotton factories are gradually becoming active, so the people's hearts are watching a little higher. However, some speculators took advantage of the rise to sell.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Is Good for Four Jiao</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Biao Flower pre-market, the US cotton was flat, and although the exchange rate shrank, the people's hearts softened. Each month was flat. In the afternoon, some shorts made up, and each month rose by 3 and 4 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 66,400 dan. It was found that Zhenda sold 2,700 dan, Changfeng 3,800 dan, Dafu 5,000 dan, Yuanda 4,600 dan, Yuanda 1,900 dan, Tongxing 1,300 dan, and Wenhe 2,200 dan.

<p>Total 607,200</p>
<h3>Factory Needs Gradually Start</h3>
<p>The sales of existing cotton are gradually developing, and all factories have entered. The source is estimated to be 12 packages of Yaohua and 180 packages of Tonghua. The current flower prices are as follows:</p>

<h3>US Cotton Lingers Without Change</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market lacked significant sellers. Wall Street was weak and tired, but short covering led to a rebound. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, while futures rose by one to four points per pound. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by one point, while futures fell by two to four points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. The Bombay cotton market was firm due to speculative buying, closing steadily. As a result, the price was flat, with two increases and one decrease per rupee. Oomra fell by 0.25 rupees, while White Broach rose by 0.75 rupees. (Report from the 15th)</p>

<h3>Grain, Flour, and Wheat Sales Extremely Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning with prices initially flat, then stabilizing. The quoted price for foreign wheat was around 45 cents in Chicago and 10 cents in Canada. After the opening, sentiment was generally flat, and actual sales remained weak, with purchasing power being the weakest seen since the market opened. However, factories held firm, and short covering pushed prices slightly higher, improving market sentiment. By the afternoon opening, trading was quiet, but due to more shorts in the market, prices rose slightly, improving sentiment. However, actual sales remained unchanged, ultimately feeling firm but with some slackness. As a result, the current month rose by 7.5 li, April rose by 5 li, May rose by 2.5 li, June rose by 1 fen, and July and August each rose by 2.5 li.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was very little trading of standard wheat futures. Only one transaction was opened for March, April, June, July, and August in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The market was very quiet, and there were no spot wheat transactions. Soochow glutinous rice rose slightly by 5 fen.</p>
<p>—Suddenly a Turnaround in Late Rice Market—</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over thirty sources (more than 5,000 piculs) arrived, mostly late rice, with a small amount of thick glutinous rice. Although North and South shipping companies continued to purchase late rice, the volume was not as strong as in the previous market. A total of over 2,000 bags of Qingjiao, Songza, Xilian late rice were received. The market situation did not show much change. However, various types of thick glutinous rice saw a sudden revival in urban and rural shops, a trend that had been somewhat lackluster since the initial market. Ultimately, after a long period of weakness, it was difficult to immediately achieve a strong performance. Therefore, the price of glutinous rice from Changbang, Soochow, Nangang, etc., only increased slightly by 5 fen. The supply and demand for Duyang pointed rice remained peaceful, with little change in market conditions. Yuan-converted goods lacked flavor and were relatively strong. The supply of Yin Yuan was slightly higher, but the sales were average, showing a slightly soft trend.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 27 or 28 shipments of various goods arrived from the lower reaches of the river. The sales of various colors continued to improve in the market. White glutinous rice, early thin rice, Yangshe pointed rice, and Yin Yuan and Yuan rice all showed a firm trend.</p>
<h3>No Telegrams Sent for Silk, Tea, and Chinese Silk</h3>
<p>The current price of silk in New York has fallen to $450, and the price of Japanese silk in Yokohama is only $470-480. As a result, the market price of Chinese silk has also fallen. Various manufacturers in Shanghai believe that the cost of B-grade white factory silk is $700-800 per bale, resulting in significant losses. No silk telegrams were sent, and there were no transactions of current silk. Market sentiment continued to be sluggish.</p>
<h3>Qimen Tea Industry Remains Active</h3>
<p>The black tea produced in Qimen, Fuliang, Jiande, and other places amounts to no less than 60,000-70,000 chests each year. Last year, there were about 300 tea processing firms. The business results showed that most of them suffered losses. As a result, no less than 20-30 firms were forced to close down. The tea season is about to begin, and various firms in Qimen and Fuliang are actively preparing for their operations. They have been in contact with various tea warehouses in Shanghai for loans, and the situation remains active.</p>

<p>Informal Talk</p>
<h3>The Marriage System Under Feudal Remnants</h3>
<p>—Jia Wei</p>
<p>Recently, my friend He Jun mentioned that Lin Jun had been looking depressed and unhappy lately. The reason, he said, was that his parents had already set the date for his wedding. I remember back in the autumn of last year! I heard that Lin Jun had already been "betrothed" by his parents' arrangement. But at that time, I didn't hear him say that he was unwilling. But this time, I heard that he was against his "parents' orders," and had already explained and argued with them several times.</p>
<p>Yes, Lin Jun is very young—just turned twenty—and is still a high school student and not yet "self-reliant." If he is going to talk about marriage so soon (although he doesn't have to bear the burden at this time), then whether we say it subjectively or objectively, it is still too early! But since Lin Jun is under his parents' financial control, and I heard that his parents' intentions are very firm this time, therefore, although Lin Jun is resolutely resisting, what the outcome will be is difficult to predict—Lin Jun is also very passive. Comedy or tragedy? It is difficult to "resolve" what will happen "next time"!</p>
<p>Originally, in the case of ordinary "rich kids, even though they are still immature, not fully developed, and have no skills," they are still able to get a "good wife" to accompany them—what is called a "virtuous mother and good wife." In 19th-century society, such pathetic and laughable facts were very common. But in this day and age—although "free love" and "marriage autonomy" are being loudly proclaimed everywhere, marriages conducted through deceitful and hypocritical "matchmakers' words" are still prevalent. These "profit-seeking" "matchmakers" have harmed countless young men and women and created countless "single men and resentful women," but why are they still rampant everywhere? The reason, generally speaking, is!</p>
<p>The hateful and detestable poison of feudal remnants is deeply hidden in the stubborn and outdated minds of ordinary people with "a little property" or more. The reason why people with sons are eager to arrange marriages for their sons is because they have "money"; they don't have to worry about "eating" or "clothing," and all they have in mind is "eagerly awaiting grandchildren." What they want is "good reputation": they are waiting day and night to be called "blessed with many children and long life" by their "comrades"—those who "share the same ideals"! In this way, they can gain the praise and envy of their "comrades," and also achieve "carrying on the family line" and "honoring their ancestors."</p>
<p>As for those who have daughters, what they have in mind is...since daughters will eventually become "someone else's" one day, then why bother spending more money on "raising" them—of course, there are also those who pamper their "precious daughters," but that is an exception. Therefore, once they reach a "certain" age—mostly "early marriage," right?—they are always planning to marry them off to "someone else"—to "sell" them. Look—both parties are under these conditions; and they are unwilling and don't need to consult their children's aspirations, future prospects, and lifelong happiness, because they know that this is "predestined" and can be determined by their "fate," right?!</p>
<p>Okay, all they need to do is wait for the "matchmakers" to come and turn things upside down and bring the two parties together, making this "transaction." After explaining how "well-matched" the two families are (?), then all they need to do is have the family fortune tellers "arrange" the children's "eight characters"; and based on what these "omniscient immortals" say about "harmony" or "conflict," they decide the children's "lifelong affairs." And society probably adds a lot of excitement because of their "fate's decision"—"comedies of happiness," "comedies of sorrow," please pay attention to the "social news" columns of major newspapers!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in today's social organization, all the contradictions are becoming more and more acute day by day...The impact of the global economic panic, the wave of collapse of the agricultural economy, has flooded every city with an increasing number of unemployed people; ordinary unfortunate people are all falling into this vortex, frantically crushing and toppling each other in a final struggle. And pitiful are those young people who grow up in families poisoned by feudal remnants, who do not yet have the ability to be independent—there are many who have considerable ability and knowledge but cannot find a way out—and yet are destined to shoulder a "virtuous mother and good wife" and "carry on the family line"—which of course is not "economically independent"—and must bear the great burden of "many children and grandchildren." And the facts will tell us what their future will be like!</p>
<p>Young friends with aspirations! To liberate yourselves from the "shackles of the old ethics" and seize true "freedom," the only way is to work hard to eradicate and annihilate these feudal remnants; but if you want to obtain the true meaning of "free love," you can only find it in the "social organization" that will be reformed in the future.</p>
<h3>Regret</h3>
<p>—Lingzi</p>
<p>—A Preliminary Attempt at Psychological Sketch—</p>
<p>When he told me that he agreed to what I said... "From now on, we'll just be friends," although my lips were moving and uttered this sentence... "You also know that if you don't agree with me, we won't even be friends in the future"; but my heart, in my heart, felt like it had been electrocuted, shocked and regretful. After I introduced Fen to him and heard him say that Fen expressed her love for him, I not only regretted not letting him love Fen, but also hated myself and hated him.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday, I went to his place, and the maid said that he went out with a young lady. This sentence was like a sharp knife stabbing into my heart, turning regret into hatred, and an inexplicable jealousy filled my mind. I don't hate him, I hate Fen. I deeply feel that... Fen, she is my rival in love! I sat in his study for an hour or two. I didn't want to rummage through his drawers, but I was so bored that I wanted to do something, and I hated Fen, and a surge of jealousy stirred my nerves, wanting to find the letters Fen gave him to read. Unexpectedly, I rummaged through his drawers, and Fen's letters were nowhere to be found (probably hidden on his person), but I found the letter I gave him the day before yesterday, arranging to see him today. It would have been better if I hadn't looked at it, but the more I looked at it, the more I hated it, and I tore it into pieces at will. He said we were friends. Can a friend's appointment be broken? - However, a lover is closer than a friend, Fen came, how could I not let him go out with Fen and stay at home to wait for me? Thinking of this, I hate Fen, and at the same time hate myself... Fen took him away from my arms, hateful, but I myself didn't tell him that I couldn't love him and taught him to love others and just be friends, how could Fen have taken him away? I should blame myself, why is it that I still love him in my heart, but I don't want to love him because of some future?</p>
<p>There was a dish of sweets on his table, Magpie Kele Sakura Candy, etc., silver paper, green paper, red paper, white paper, colorful, really cute. I ate a few pieces casually, looked out the window, and the spring rain was falling in wisps. I was wondering when I suddenly thought that these sweets must have been specially bought for Fen to eat, and Fen took him out to play after eating one or two bites in a hurry, so there were so many left. Thinking of this, I didn't want to eat them anymore. But at the same time, I thought that these sweets were his, I loved him, and he loved me, so why not eat his sweets, and leave them for Fen to eat when she comes back? I insist on eating them, eating them all up, not leaving a single bite for Fen, so it was like kissing him, kissing the sweets one by one first, then eating them into my stomach, and then eating his heart!</p>
<p>Suddenly, I saw a bottle of rose juice wine on his table, and I remembered that he used to drink because I said I didn't love him. This time he is drinking again, he must still not be able to forget me, and Fen is loving him on the other hand, he has to relieve his sorrow with wine after being stimulated by contradictions. He said he hated me, he really hates me!</p>
<p>Xiang, you hate me, you don't know that I hate you even more! I said I don't love you anymore, I said we're just friends, even introducing Fen to you, it's not sincere, it's all testing you, and you're so honest, believing it's true. You hate me, but you don't know how regretful and resentful I am now...</p>
<p>Thinking of this regret, I can't help but want to drink and numb my own</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>nerves... I know that the numbing power of alcohol is only temporary, and when I wake up from the alcohol, the sorrow and hatred will be even more profound, but I poured a full glass of his rose juice wine and drank it all in one gulp.</p>
<p>I haven't drunk alcohol for many years. After drinking this full glass today, I got drunk in a short time. Small golden flowers shot out in front of my eyes, and the floor was shaking. I couldn't help but feel terrified... What if they came back and saw me? In this drunken state? I hurriedly left a note to tell him and Fen that I came to see them, and staggered out of his house, returning to school.</p>
<p>On the road, the spring rain was falling in wisps. My heart was more sorrowful in my drunkenness. The cold wind blew, and I felt a chill. When I returned to school, I felt dizzy. I touched my bed and fell down, feeling very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Thinking of today's encounter, my tears flowed down!</p>
<h3>Biography of a Street Urchin (10)</h3>
<p>—Made by Chen Jingsheng</p>
<p>This grass is really effective, victory is ours</p>
<h3>Exploring the Plum Blossoms</h3>
<p>—Qian Xu</p>
<p>Although the wind is very strong, it is always so warm when it blows on people; people are also lazy and don't want to do anything. All of this undoubtedly tells people that... "Spring has arrived."</p>
<p>Spring, how beautiful! The withered yellow grass has already taken off her haggard clothes, revealing a delicate face; the solemn expression no longer leaps on people's faces; the water in the pond or river is blown out by the spring breeze with poetic wrinkles... the birds on the branches sing tunes that have changed from sad to joyful; everything is filled with the breath of "life." Even though the waves of national economic depression are coming from every cheap big advertisement on the , they cannot wash away the plum blossoms, which have long been designated as our "national flower." At this time, they have sprung up in response to the season. Thus, the gentlemen and young masters who are generally idle and rich, because their "interest" has arrived, are making great "elegant" gestures of "exploring the plum blossoms."</p>
<p>We are born with a "fate" of being both busy and poor. Over the years, there has been no "year," no "festival," and no spring; we are surrounded by three-dimensional buildings all year round, only knowing to put on clothes when it is cold and take them off when it is hot. Several years have passed by in a muddle. However, this year, we finally got a very special opportunity to follow the gentlemen and young masters and also played once in the "grand event" of "exploring the plum blossoms" that is possessed by "idle" and "rich" people.</p>
<p>Because it seems that this little page can also occupy a place in my entire life history, I recorded it...</p>
<p>It was a clear morning, and when the gentle breeze blew past others and reached our side, we were a little intoxicated. Ah! This lovely nature.</p>
<p>Originally, having gotten used to a mechanical life, once able to throw ourselves into the arms of nature and enjoy the taste that we have always dreamed of, how eager and happy we were. The train was rushing forward with its head buried, occasionally emitting the whistling sound; the telephone poles on both sides retreated backwards in rows; the green fields, the dark farmers, the vendors singing tunes without rhythm, looked filled with the atmosphere of "life" in our joyful eyes.</p>
<p>Three hours of bumpy travel will not feel bitter in happiness. We finally stepped into the "Plum Garden" in Wuxi. Tens of thousands of plum trees were adorned with flowers, and the fragrance filled people's surroundings. We followed the other comrades—of course, the "plum blossom exploration" comrades—and ran around randomly. We climbed to the high places to look at the still waters of Taihu Lake in the same way. We looked at the noble and beautiful ladies in the crowd in the same way. Perhaps because of the "fate" of being born "busy and poor," we finally felt "bored." We discussed leaving, we wanted to return to Shanghai. Three hours of bumpy travel passed by in dejection, feeling both "long" and "bitter."</p>
<p>Eagerness and joy have become a thing of the past, and the atmosphere of "life" has also disappeared before our eyes. We understand that this kind of "elegant move" is ultimately a plaything for "idle" people, and is definitely not something that we, who are generally busy and poor, can do. What makes us tremble even more is the "economic depression" after the atmosphere of "life" has disappeared!</p>
<p>The harvest after a waste of spirit, time, and money is to make me patiently return to a lonely life and forever shatter the purple dream.</p>
<h3>From Seeking Death to Scrambling for Life</h3>
<p>—Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Sociologists say that suicide is also a kind of infectious disease. This is indeed true, as can be confirmed by the continuing occurrence of suicide incidents in Shanghai recently.</p>
<p>Is suicide meaningful or worthless? Courageous or cowardly? Worthy of sympathy or worthy of condemnation? I think it's hard to judge. It is human nature to cling to life and fear death. A person who goes down the road of suicide will not do so unless it is absolutely necessary. Therefore, people who commit suicide have their own reasons why they have to commit suicide, which cannot be easily praised or attacked by onlookers. No matter how complete the critic's reasons are, if you change places, I'm afraid you yourself will have some difficulty being in control, right? However, the impact of suicide on society is a bad phenomenon, and this is something that no one can deny.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, those who criticize suicide say in unison, "Humans are social animals, and they should take society as the premise and strive for society to be considered reasonable; but those who commit suicide do the opposite, thinking only of personal joys and sorrows, thus abandoning their due responsibility to society, and their actions are obviously wrong." But how many people who are social animals can reach this point? Let's say that suicide is a worthless, cowardly, and reprehensible act; we, who are still alive, can be regarded as meaningful, brave, and sympathetic people; but has society received any benefits from us? What have we contributed to society? How have we sacrificed and worked for society? Have we fulfilled our obligations to society? If we cannot provide satisfactory answers to these questions, then our words can at most be said to be temporary scrambling for life, and in fact, they have no significant meaning! Therefore, I say: rather than scrambling for life, it is better to seek death!</p>
<h3>Lament</h3>
<p>—Nier</p>
<p>Since the opening of the national film "Twin Sisters," for twenty days, everyone has praised it as wonderful. It is said (because the author was rejected twice by the "full house" sign, and dared not risk a third attempt due to the high cost of transportation) that Hu Die's crying, in particular, has won the audience's tears. Yesterday, Aunt Ningbo in the front building said to me: "Mr., "Twin Sisters" is really wonderful. It made my tears flow "dada"!"</p>
<p>Why is crying so deeply touching?</p>
<p>Speaking of crying, it reminds me of crying, and a bag of tears can't help but blur my eyes. So, I picked up a pen to write a lament. Fortunately, the Qingming Festival is approaching, so what's wrong with crying?</p>
<p>There is genuine crying and fake crying. If the crying in "Twin Sisters" (I sincerely regret not having heard it for myself) is fake crying. The viewers treat the fake as real, shedding a lot of tears along with it (as if it really happened), which is too unworthy. The day before yesterday, a man died next door. His wife wailed loudly at the coffin. This is genuine crying. The husband is called the sky. Having lost her sky, she can cry loudly. However, the onlookers come to listen to the crying, but take pleasure in other people's wailing, which is really incomprehensible! If the wife of the deceased knew the situation of the audience in "Twin Sisters," she would probably turn her crying into laughter, to the great joy of the mourners.</p>
<p>Besides genuine crying and fake crying, there is also crying that is both genuine and fake, neither genuine nor fake. If you have a mind for it, you can find it everywhere. However, writing aims to be popular, so let me give an example... An old comedian was famous for his crying at the time, and his monthly income was better than that of the mayor of Shanghai. But after he became a comedian, his later years were bleak. So, those who cry for people are also cried for by people. Don't see (should be hear) the sound of ah... from the radio, which makes people want to vomit. Those who cry take the old comedian as their ancestor, so those who cry for the old comedian are like a memorial offering condolences. However, it is both genuine and fake, neither genuine nor fake. The crying brings a steady stream of performances, which can also be said to be making the most of crying. If the old comedian has a spirit, has his crying reputation been swept away?</p>
<p>As for the hypocritical compassion of the cat crying for the mouse, what about after the death of a certain poet and a certain writer? This is crying, that is mourning. Poets and writers are not valued when they are alive, but become famous after death. I, Nier, am not smart, but I recommend it as a new technique for writers to ascend to the literary world. Is the author Zhang Jun interested?</p>
<p>Writing a lament alone, I don't realize where my tears are coming from. I originally wanted to cry again and again, but I was afraid that crying would hurt my spirit and affect my life, so I temporarily ended it, waiting for a continued crying.</p>
<p>After crying, I put down my pen and laughed three times, so that the income and expenditure are offset, so as to pay attention to hygiene.</p>
<h3>Minor Problems</h3>
<p>— Neil</p>
<p>Those of us who belong to the "tram class" and don't have cars to get around with, feel that copper coins are the most annoying things. Exchanging a double dime at the cigarette paper store yields forty-odd coins, which can be quite bothersome, especially in the summer. However, the tram fare (in the past) was forty coins. To avoid inexplicable losses, one has no choice but to dislike them.</p>
<p>I take the tram every day, and the inconvenience has become a habit. However, not long ago, all the passengers on the tram [gap] . It turned out that the double dime [gap] had dropped to forty-five coins, but the tram regulations had risen to forty-</p>

<p>four coins. Even someone without [gap] arithmetical skills would know that the simple difference is only one copper coin [gap]. While saving the trouble of exchanging coins [continuation], the loss of only one [currency] coin is something one can still afford, so why not do it!</p>
<p>Now the market price of double dimes has returned to forty-eight coins, and passengers buying tickets with double dimes on the tram are no longer often seen. I believe this, like the lottery drawing for the aviation prize, is a minor issue like the evening newspaper raising its price. Because if the market price of double dimes were to drop to forty-three, or forty-two... coins, what would the tram company authorities do?</p>

<h3>Dilemma</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I have a friend who is originally from Guangdong. In the 18th year of the Republic, he was visiting Shantou when an old woman was very pleased with my friend's personality and was willing to betroth her most beloved adopted daughter to him. Because the old woman had no children, only this adopted daughter, she loved her as the apple of her eye. She wanted my friend to become her live-in son-in-law. Later, my friend used three hundred silver dollars to marry her daughter (no conditions were stipulated at the time). Now they have a son who is three or four years old. However, my friend's parents in his hometown had already married him to a wife, and she has already given birth to a daughter. Before my friend married the old woman's daughter, they both knew that my friend already had a wife in his hometown. It is clear that their marriage was based on the wishes of both families. Now my friend wants to bring his wife back to his hometown to live with him because of the difficult life in Shantou, but both she and her mother are unwilling to return, putting my friend in an impossible situation. He wants to divorce her, but he can't bear to part with his son; if he reconciles with her, it would ultimately be futile. He is now in a dilemma and doesn't know what to do, so I am especially asking you, elder, to devise a good solution. I also hope you will answer the following questions in your amateur column:</p>
<p>(1) Is this kind of marriage legally valid?</p>
<p>(2) Who should the child born of this marriage belong to?</p>
<p>(3) How can the procedure for becoming a live-in son-in-law be established? Can such a live-in son-in-law without written documentation be legally established?</p>
<p>(4) Now my friend wants to deny being a live-in son-in-law and file a lawsuit in court. Is it possible for him to win back his son?</p>
<p>I humbly ask for answers to all of the above. I will be twelvefold grateful to you. I will repay your divine favor in the future.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Zhang Qiu</p>
<p>Answer: Bigamy is inherently unreasonable. Since Mr. Zhang's friend already had a wife in his hometown, he shouldn't have become someone else's live-in son-in-law. But the matter has already passed, so what's the point of talking about it. Now let's discuss what your friend should do?</p>
<p>From your letter, between the lines, it is vaguely seen that your friend and his Shantou wife have no love for each other. If your friend was deeply in love with his Shantou wife, then even if life were difficult, he would probably rather struggle under poverty and hunger than take a step back and think about returning to his hometown. Moreover, because they are unwilling to return, he wants to separate from them, and what he is reluctant to part with is only his "son." How could a person be so detached? From the woman's perspective, if she could truly trust him and empathize with his difficulties, then even if she returned to his hometown with him, despite the many inconveniences, she would definitely be willing to return with him. Therefore, based on this speculation, the editor dares to conclude that their love has broken down. Since the love between the two parties has broken down, then the editor believes that they should simply and quickly agree to separate without forcing each other to continue. But this is just the editor's opinion. Perhaps your friend has other hidden reasons, so this solution can only be provided for your friend's reference.</p>
<p>The four questions you asked are answered as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Legally invalid.</p>
<p>(2) Should be jointly owned by your friend and his wife.</p>
<p>(3) There are no specific conditions stipulated by law.</p>
<p>(4) The blood relationship between father and son and mother and son cannot be broken, and the mother must file a lawsuit to fight for it. The Editor</p>

<h3>Lulu's Victory (10) (3)</h3>
<p>— By Italian M. Serao, translated by Jing Xin</p>
<p>"One is here, the other is there," she murmured; "but what about before this? Enough! I must help."</p>
<p>"For so many powerful reasons, I cannot marry Robert Montelfranco." Finally, Lulu said to her mother.</p>
<p>"Your reasons are all extremely bizarre, my daughter," the mother replied, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"In short, I must frankly and clearly tell you that Robert does not please me, so I don't want to marry him."</p>
<p>"That's not frank at all; it's just a whim. Robert loves you."</p>
<p>"He will comfort himself."</p>
<p>"You have already exchanged marriage vows."</p>
<p>"We can cancel them. We are no longer living in the past when people could be forced into marriage."</p>
<p>"What about social criticism?"</p>
<p>"Mother, what is society?"</p>
<p>"People."</p>
<p>"Who is 'People' Mr.? I don't know him; I can't make myself unhappy because of 'People' Mr."</p>
<p>"You are a frightening daughter! But how can I talk to Robert? What can I say to him?"</p>
<p>"Say whatever you want. You are my mother. You should know what to do."</p>
<p>"Ah, indeed! Clean up the mess you've made. There will definitely be rumors."</p>
<p>"I don't think so; you can speak frankly and openly. Really, I think you can say bad things about me—call me arbitrary, frivolous, immature; just say I wouldn't make a good wife, I'm not serious at all, I lack dignity, and you should say my sister is—"</p>
<p>"Your sister? Have you lost your mind, Lulu!"</p>
<p>"Hush! It's easy for you to say that. Currently, Robert and Sophia are very cold to each other, but if they can get to know each other intimately, they can become close to each other, and then—who can say? If you marry off your eldest daughter first, people will praise you as a good mother."</p>
<p>"Indeed—"</p>
<p>"I won't go on like this without a husband... I'm just eighteen years old. I still want to make myself happy for a while; I still want to dance a lot... I want to spend my youth with my dear, kind little mother——"</p>
<p>"You are a little rascal," the mother replied, moved, embracing her daughter.</p>
<p>"We understand each other, right? Publicly spread this ugly news to Robert, but add that we must be friends forever, and we hope to see him often. If these two people love each other, they don't have to worry; it's destined."</p>

<p>Film Supplement</p>
<h3>Mai Mulin on Greta Garbo (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yuan Lin</p>
<p>Also, the climax of the story in the film is when she abdicates, but in reality, if her life were written into a true novel, it should probably be when she goes out to wander. At the same time, we also assume that her motivation for abdicating is love for a certain foreigner.</p>
<p>Apart from these deliberate errors, everything in the film can be said to be no different from history. I absolutely believe in Garbo's talent. This talent of hers can definitely show the extraordinary personality of Christine that she usually dreams of. In fact, she only decided to return from Europe after signing the contract to play this role.</p>
<p>This film is not a song and dance film, not a fairy tale, and not a work that simply shows off clothing to the audience. In other words, this does not belong to any work that has been successful in the past in film, drama, or even radio.</p>
<p>Recently, I have become a bit tired of those so-called dramatic films that are currently popular. I am very fond of great dramas, but only on the stage or in books. On the silver screen, which only emphasizes images and does not require beautiful writing, it instead causes aversion. In the near future, I am sure that these two arts (drama and film) will definitely become things with their own characteristics. The reason why I want to develop a continuous rhythm in my works that progresses according to the development of the story is precisely this.</p>
<p>Garbo is great! She has her talent! — No, besides talent, she has something else. When I watch her work, I feel like a strong vitality has suddenly been injected into a past character and started to move.</p>
<p>People probably know that Garbo doesn't like acting in front of people she doesn't know, but during filming, in addition to all the actors and directors, there are probably also the scriptwriters present, plus the electrical technicians, photographers, assistants, sound technicians, sound assistants, a female stage manager who records the director's words, and sometimes photographers who take stills for publicity, editors, etc., all walking around inside. The atmosphere of the film set is indeed too stimulating for sensitive actors. Therefore, for Garbo, a generally sensitive woman, it is indeed an unbearable thing to be surrounded by a large number of onlookers in addition to the people mentioned above. Because she has not had any stage experience.</p>
<p>But she is a very kind woman to the cameraman William Daniels, who has been working with us all along, and to the people we work with all the time. I always see her quietly talking to those temporary actresses. She is very fond of innocent children. She often gathers many children playing near her and personally invites them to eat Swedish snacks in front of the stove. I think these are the happiest times for her.</p>
<p>Garbo, who has lived in Europe for a long time, has become even more lonely than before. Since returning to America, she has only attended one screening of Marlene Dietrich's "Song of Love." Whatever her reasons, let us respect her silence and solitude! (End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "General Yun"</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>"FRONTIERMARSHAL"</p>
<p>— Great Shanghai —</p>
<p>Among the monotonous heroic and beautiful "Western films," "General Yun" can be considered a better one.</p>
<p>Just as we are used to seeing childish fights in domestic films and have become extremely disgusted, we cannot help but be disgusted with the martial arts of the heroes in "Western films." The set of "General Yun" is just the same, the waste of American film production is truly appalling.</p>
<p>However, the depiction of the unscrupulous mayor in "General Yun" is very good.</p>
<p>That mayor, on the surface, is the highest local official responsible to the public under "democratic politics," but in reality, he is a bandit and assassin who sits on the ground and divides the spoils!</p>
<p>Naturally, such a mayor is a very good explanation of so-called democratic politics; however, the screenwriter of "General Yun" cannot help but have a shortcoming in his understanding. He can only see the corruption of this notorious mayor, but he cannot see that the essence of "democratic politics" is the trampling of the lower class by the upper social stratum.</p>
<p>The hero Wei Di, needless to say, is a generous and compassionate person who pities the weak. For example, he met Mary in the carriage to Johnston and fell in love with her. After learning that her father had been killed, he decided to stay in Johnston temporarily to protect her secretly. He is courageous, loyal, and loves to fight for justice. He personally visited Johnston to arrest Peng En, a huge bandit that the police did not dare to catch, and he insisted on going to catch him. When Warren vaguely told him some of the mayor's misdeeds, he tried his best to explore and punish this corrupt official. Thus, our hero moved Warren and even moved his former enemy Peng Si. Mary will definitely love him, and the girl Jing Qi in the tavern also loves him, even sacrificing her life for him.</p>
<p>Why did "General Yun" secretly write about the mayor being executed at the end and vigorously describe Jing Qi's sacrifice and the success of Wei Di and Mary's love? It is easy to understand that killing the evil corrupt official is ultimately very much related to "morality," and Jing Qi's death and Mary's (THROWS)</p>
<p>ERSELFINTOYATT'SARMS) are precisely the spoils of the hero's victory.</p>
<p>As for the descriptions of Warren and Peng En, "General Yun" only shows their brute force, loyalty, and worship of heroes. As for why they became bandits? How did their concepts of hero worship, loyalty, and brute force come about? No answers can be found in "General Yun."</p>
<p>This is what the screenwriter of "General Yun" would not understand; not only that, but more importantly, the current so-called "Western films" only see the heroes "flying on horseback on the pasture, shooting without fail," and "having a warm embrace and unwavering love," but do not see the vast number of farmers wailing in the midst of agricultural panic, and do not see these farmers realizing the ineffectiveness of agricultural relief laws under unbearable oppression and becoming aware of their own strength.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the delicate style of "General Yun" ultimately broke the rough brushstrokes of Western films, such as (1) Wei Di and Warren enjoying wine together, (2) Jing Qi's death, (3) The triangular love between Wei Di, Mary, and Jing Qi is very successful, which is probably because the story itself is suitable for such a style.</p>
<p>The close and organic connection between the sound structure and the picture structure should be mentioned. For example, the scene of Wei Di catching thieves can very well express the atmosphere at that time. Among the actors, George O'Brien's Wei Di is of course very good at it. The roles of Mary, Warren, Jing Qi, and the mayor are also very hardworking.</p>
<p>However, the golden age of heroic and beautiful Western films has finally passed away. In China, "Fire Burning [Gap]" has been abandoned, and American martial arts films, which are not much better, are probably not welcome either. We are looking forward to a new film that is more in touch with the social reality of the American West.</p>
<h3>Meeting Gift for Divorced Couples</h3>
<p>— Reply</p>
<p>After a divorce, how should a couple meet when they reunite after a long separation? There is probably no set rule for this, right? Now I will describe a very interesting precedent. When you have a need, you can take it as a model.</p>
<p>Little Van Dyke returned to Hollywood from Europe. He and Joan Crawford are a couple who "amicably divorced," so when he arrived in Hollywood, Joan Crawford thought about going to the airport to meet him, but many Mingjiang held her back and wouldn't let her go. The reason is that she was afraid that this piece of news would be published in the newspaper, and everyone would misunderstand that she and Little Van Dyke would reunite. Now Joan and Franchot Tone (FRANCHOT LONE) are already in love and will soon announce their engagement. In this way, I am afraid that many rights and wrongs will be provoked again. Therefore, she did not go, but made a phone call to him, inviting him to her residence. He came. When they met, they shook hands happily, but did not kiss. Then Joan took her ex-husband's arm and inspected the various rooms of the house, pointing out many new pieces of furniture and decorations that had been newly placed after the separation. Little Van Dyke praised her intelligence one by one. Finally, they arrived in the sitting room. The two of them sat down and talked about everything non-domestic. At this time, Franchot Tone appeared. Did Little Van Dyke feel cramped? No! Not at all! The two of them actually talked happily. They talked about everything about the film set. They talked for two hours, completely ignoring Joan, and Joan watched the harmonious feelings of her two ex-husbands and future husband (note: not ex-husband and future husband) and enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Isn't this something that we Chinese people, who avoid seeing each other after a divorce, should emulate?</p>
<h3>Chen Ningqiu on Stage</h3>
<p>The YMCA will perform "LADIESANDGENTLEMEN" on Saturday and Sunday. A brief introduction has already been given in this publication. Rehearsals have been very busy these past two days, and the atmosphere is tense. Film stars Chen Ningqiu, Zhao Dan, etc. have been visiting for days to watch. It is said that the two of them are already discussing with the writer of "Noble People" whether or not to have "Lowly People" as well? Ling He said... "Okay, when there is a chance, let's do it again."</p>
<p>Also, Ling He is too busy with the stage to even write film reviews. When the official performance comes, I think there will definitely be very good results. Otherwise, Ling He would never work so hard.</p>
<p>Prelude to "Under the Lamp Before the Moon"</p>
<p>The romantic blockbuster currently being screened in Nanjing stars the actress Elisa Landi. The background of the play is the famous gold-selling cave in the world, Monte Carlo, and the garden of Central Europe - Vienna. Its scenery is beautiful and unparalleled, needless to say.</p>
<p>In between, there are pursuits between men and women, and mutual stratagems of capture and release. The romantic parts are like drinking mellow wine, and the amorous parts are like playing with famous flowers. It is truly the essence of a love history. Elisa once revealed her charm in "Spring Colors of the Roman Palace." In this film, she plays a maid who learns to be a lady's maid, lively and charming, graceful and charming, and Paul Luga and others are also famous stars of the time. With so many big stars, a good background and an engaging plot, its beauty can be known. (Yet To Be Paid)</p>
<h3>Tianyi News</h3>
<p>— Liang Yu</p>
<p>Model beauty Ye Qiuxin often goes to the company these days to practice Peking Opera with her teacher Chen Yumei (according to Chai, she was originally Chen's student). The piano player is Wang Zhongxi, a little brother from Beiping.</p>
<p>The wind and rain are thin, and the spring is cold and steep. However, Chen Yumei is wearing a georgette summer dress to film "Happy Enemies," and she is so cold that she keeps calling "Mom!"</p>
<p>A certain Russian newspaper reporter recently visited Chen Yumei at Tianyi. The Russian reporter is proficient in Chinese and talked with Chen for three hours. He also asked for a signed photo of Chen to be published in a certain Russian newspaper for publicity. The director of the publicity department, Gao Tianqi, is currently rushing to compile two new songs, "Moon Bay Bay" and "Spring Night Serenade," for Lu Lixia to sing in "Two Brothers" and Ye Qiuxin to sing in "Spring Night Serenade."</p>
<p>The old man Wei Pengfei has a female cat at home, which recently gave birth to five black kittens. Yesterday, he brought them to the company and gave one each to Chen Yumei, Hu Shan, Ye Qiuxin, Lu Lixia, Lu Jianfen, and Wang Huijuan.</p>
<p>Cao Xuesong's adaptation of the world-famous work "In Meng Hu" is adapted according to the original work. It is said that the word "In" will be changed to the word "Ying."</p>
<p>Shao Zuiweng has been discussing the script with Cao Xuesong, Yu Dingxun, Chen Yahua, and several screenwriters these days. (Yet To Be Paid)</p>
<h3>New Film News</h3>

The approval certificate from the Central Film Inspection Committee has also been issued, and it will be released soon.</p>

<h3>SCARLET EMPRESS (7)</h3>
<p>— Su Mei</p>
<p>Catherine rode back on her horse, and Alexei greeted her. He whispered to her, "Not a moment has passed without me thinking of you. I must speak with you alone." Catherine looked at him coldly and said, "Be careful. Everyone's eyes are on us; they will tell my husband." Alexei said anxiously, "Tomorrow morning, when you go out riding, let's meet in the stables. No one will see us there—I'll arrange it." Catherine asked, "What if I don't ride tomorrow?" Alexei looked at her with pleading eyes and said, "You must go. No one will know."</p>
<p>Catherine returned to her room, and she seemed very happy while changing. Mary, who was helping her dress, saw this and asked, "Your Highness seems to be in high spirits now, is it to meet your husband?" Catherine laughed awkwardly, "Oh, I forgot I had a husband." Mary said playfully, "Then, Your Highness, I'm afraid you're going to meet your lover." Catherine said, "Mary, you are also a bad thing, do you also have a lover?" Mary said, "It would be good if I had a lover. Here, no one is without a lover. They all have them, except me." Catherine said, "I think our Empress probably doesn't have a lover." Mary said, "Huh, she doesn't? She has many lovers, changing them every month." After she finished speaking, she pleaded with Catherine, "You must not tell anyone that I said this. Otherwise, my tongue will be cut off." Catherine comforted her, "Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. I also don't believe your words. But I don't have a lover: I'm happy today because I'm going to see my mother." When Mary heard this, her face immediately changed. She said, "My Highness, don't you know?" Catherine asked, "Know what?" Mary said, "Your mother has already returned to Germany. She left last night at midnight! Her Majesty sent her back in the middle of the night."</p>
<p>Catherine suddenly felt lost, looking around and saying, "Why didn't she say she would see me?" After she finished speaking, she immediately went to find the Empress. At that time, the Empress was holding a state council meeting, and Catherine suddenly barged in. The Empress angrily scolded her for barging in without being summoned, but Catherine was not afraid at all, opening her eyes wide and asking, "Why did you send my mother away?" The Empress stood up and scolded, "Are you here to question me, you little rascal?" She said harshly to Catherine, "I sent your mother away because she didn't teach you well. I called you here to make you a good wife and to produce an heir for the Russian throne. Now get out of here immediately!" After she finished speaking, she rang the bell, and her favored bodyguard, Ivan Shuvalov, came in. She ordered him to send the Grand Duchess to her own palace. She said, "There, my own eyes can watch her! Teach her how to be a Russian wife!" (To be continued)</p>
