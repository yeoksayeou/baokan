<p>處此全世界經濟衰頽之雰圍中。獨日本之經濟情勢。漸入佳境。其邁步前</p>
<p>進之勇氣。直令各國爲之驚惶不安。而羣謀抵禦。按日本之產業經濟。所謂四大支柱。爲（一）米·（二）絲繭·（三）輸出工業·（四）軍需工業。除米與絲繭。因去年之豐收。與美國生絲市塲之跌價。已成爲目前亟待解决之農村問題外。其輸出與軍需兩種工業。則呈飛躍發展之狀態。農村方面如米之產額。一九三三年超過</p>
<p>七千萬石。此外朝鮮及台灣產米二千餘萬石。爲日本罕有之大豐年。因之米價低落過甚。政府遂努力于米穀統制。及外地米調節問題。關於米穀統制法之主要者。爲就米之生產費及國民之生計兩者着想。而於每年十二月决定米之最高最低價格。依據該項價格。從事米之買賣。一九三三年十二月十六日米穀統制委員會。曾决定最高價格爲日金三十圓五十錢。最低價格爲二十三圓三十錢。迄至最近。米穀由政府所收購者。其支出之金額。已超過五億圓。</p>
<p>米價自經政府之收購後。雖日見騰漲。然農村方面。則仍有因豐收而吿缺食者。如新　縣農民。在本年四月終。以食米吿荒。籲請政府撥給舊存米穀救濟。餘如僻遠鄕村中農民这種植米穀。而不得食米穀者極多。此蓋不盡由於分配之未得其當也。</p>
<p>蠶繭一物。爲日本農家之第二重要產物。但在最近一年中。以生絲市况之不振。呈現凄慘萬狀之低價。當一九三三年之春。絲價漲至千圓。迨夏秋之交。一轉而落於慘跌之途。祗及五百圓之半値。蓋自羅斯福氏之復興運動創行以後。蓬勃一時。入夏後忽告挫折。日本生絲之從事輸出者。佔全產額百分之八十以上。而大部份皆輸向美國方面。故美國所消費之生絲。日本產品佔百分之九十五。是日本絲繭市况之若何。全視美國市塲之盛衰爲消長。據美國之全國織物聯合會所發表。自一九三三年七月。至一九三四年六月。一年中之生絲消費量。爲四十四萬包。爲一九二五年以來之最少消費量。近年復以人造絲銷行頗廣。此項工業。日見發達。大足爲日本生絲前途之勁敵也。</p>
<p>至日本之輸出工業確有飛躍伸展狀態。究其根本原因。要在日本之機械工業。乘歐洲戰爭各國無暇他顧之機會。長足進展。遂得脫離模仿歐美時代。而入於獨創生產之組織。一方復努力於生產之合理化。使管理方法。益臻嚴密。並精研技術之進步。務求商品質料優良。成本低减。俾銷行無阻。完成其傾銷政策之企圖。日本商品因年來之擴張舊市塲。及開拓新市塲之結果。其統計數字。以一九三三年度爲例。輸出價額達十八億六千一百萬圓。較一九三一年度。激增百分之六二·三。至本年度五月止。累計約爲八億二千萬圓。較上年同期。增加百分之二二·九矣。</p>
<p>此外在遠東方面。最近如蘇俄。將自一九三五年一月一日起。取消計口授糧制度。當此歲暮闌珊聲中。蘇俄此舉。足爲世界經濟史上。平添若干之新資料。接蘇俄自一九二九年起。實行分派口糧制。爲五年計劃之一部份。凡人民悉須憑口糧票購買麫包。與其他日用品。至本年十一月二十八日。共產黨中央委員會通過决議。申請人民委員會取銷此制。人民委員會主席莫洛託夫氏。亦在該會報告。謂此舉足以刺激農工業之進展。市塲價格低减。而令工人薪金提高。至鞏固盧布。發達貿易。尤其主因。全會乃另行决議辦法七項。觀其所訂計劃。可知蘇俄經濟。已將回至一九二一年新經濟政策。而逐漸傾向於資本主義之機構。此一點爲一九三四年中世界經濟變動之特異者。以後全世界經濟將如何轉變。吾人又焉能預測乎。</p>

<h3 id="c73">岡田内閣的命運（日本通信）政黨衰微岡田上台財源有限高橋重來 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>岡田啟介海軍大將、初組閣的時候、原有第二流内閣的譏評、一則因爲他自己不是個政治家、二則并没有確定的政綱、足以喚起羣衆、祇是元老重臣借他作個憲政的象徵、和緩文治與武治的對立、期待將來一有機緣、卽恢復憲政、還有一件很重要的事、就是面臨所謂一九三六年的危機、在海洋方面尤其緊要、現在日本要找一位能够調和軍事政治財政經濟各方面的適當人物、的確不是容易、</p>
<p>前任内閣總理齊藤實、好象大度雍容、在閣内很能任各部總長去自行調度、特别是陸海雙方都各自發揮其本領、不意「帝國人造絲公司」舞弊案、由台灣銀行牽聯到財政次長黑田、同時財長高橋也有失察或監督部下不嚴的責任、這樣一來、齊藤内閣當然不好意思、再繼續幹下去、可是它的任務｜克服非常時期的任務｜并没有終了、所以經過元老重臣恊議的結果、纔推薦岡田上台、圖爲齊藤内閣的延長、其内面的意思是不要軍部中的强硬派（主張國家社會主義的）過度發表、更得設法渡過海軍軍縮會議這一重難關、岡田氏個人在軍政方面有相當長久的經騐、在政治上却不十分嫻熟、但爲人很樸質、在海軍部内信望很好、所以這時候出任閣揆、是有調和作用的、不過他的辯才很低、應付議會的技能眞是不高明、過去的臨時議會、政友會議員安藤純正質問拓務次長田中爲什麽辭職、岡田的答案是田中是民政黨推薦來的、這事情要問民政黨、他應付不甚得當、後來自知失言、又取消了這一答案、諸如此類的事、臨時議會中、竟有過好幾次、假設議會是有權威、能維持議會政治精神的話、則内閣總理這樣不負責任、不得要領的答辯、至少要引起風波的、其所以竟能安然穏渡的原因、是議會根本上失却掌握政治的能力、而政黨的劣點、又昭昭在人耳目、所以祇好任隨政府去怎樣作、</p>
<p>岡田内閣還有一點把握着時代要求、是將高橋是淸拉出來重任財長、原來藤井眞信因爲預算問題、與軍部爭執不下、而收入不敷、如照軍部的主張加稅、更惹動資本家的反感和輿論界的惡評、藤井辭職、正當臨時議會開幕的前夜、如果不得一個適當的人出來、恐怕岡田内閣就會坍台也未可知、</p>
<p>高橋是淸曾任政友會總裁、是日本政界的老前輩、他的夫人是薩摩人、他的妹子嫁與牧野伸顯的弟弟、在血緣關係上、他與薩閥（海軍閥）有深切的關係、高橋自己以往曾六任財長、於日本敗政狀况、經濟情勢、非常熟悉、而且對陸海軍雙方都特具好感、在一九一八年寺内内閣倒台後、田中義一陸長與海軍加藤友三郎爭相擴充軍備、原敬内閣差不多没法解决的時候、高橋出任調停、他以爲他們「注重國防固然很對、但注意國防、尤須注意國力｜財政實力如不加考慮、則國防等於紙上畫的餅子…」、因此陸海軍人都以爲他是爲國家着想、特别加以尊重、到現在依然如舊、荒木貞夫任陸長時、眞是獨來獨往、目空一切、但還是很傾倒於高橋、所以吐出陸軍的預算一千萬元給農林部、救濟了前内閣的危局、</p>
<p>這次高橋重任財長、其所以能得金融資本的好感、是他的經濟方面技術超越、於日本國民經濟情形格外熟悉、軍部又很推重他、於是他成爲現内閣中第一等人物、岡田内閣也因而暫時穏定、今天開會的第六十七議會、也無如政府何、否則就祗有解散了、（一九三四年十二月二十四日於東京）</p>

<p>第七回　聞語掩啼痕賣身道苦留心窺請柬投靠情殷</p>
<p>賈多才道：討小老婆的事、緩急有什麽關係，只是，我剛才把他們轟起走的，怕他們見怪。李士廉笑道：若是爲了這件事，那倒好辦，剛才我看到他們到茶房小紀屋子裹去了，也許還没有走，我走去和他們提一聲兒，讓他們再來罷。賈多才笑着連拱了兩下手道：這就不敢當，而且這件事，也不是三言兩語就可以定奪的，總當慢慢的來。太急了，怕他們拿矯。李士廉正有求於他呢，自也不也違抗了他的意思，一聽說之後，立刻變了態度，站住了没有動，向他笑道：那也好。過兩天再說。女人是不能太遷就他的，一遷就，他們就有架子了。賈多才聽着，這倒僵了，先且吸了一根烟捲，又微昂着頭想了一番，一手支了烟捲，一手摸了臉腮，身子幌蕩了兩下，笑道：他們若是没有走的話，也許是在等着我的回信，不給他們的回信，他們還不知道要等到什麽時候去呢。要不………呌茶房去看看情形罷。李士廉笑道：那不妥，茶房都是和他們勾結一氣的，你喜歡聽怎樣的話，茶房就說怎樣的話給你聽，那可聽不出什麽眞消息來。還是我去罷。賈多才就笑着拍了他的肩膀道：你去那是行的，請你看事行事好了。有機會，你不妨和他們談判談判。李士廉拍着胸道：事情包在我身上，我一定要把他們說得口服心服。不過你旣是娶如夫人，這是取樂的事情，總也得花幾個歡喜錢，假如他們有點小要求，也不妨遷就一點。再說，像賈兄在銀行界的人，那也不在乎。說着，他也抬起手來，拍拍賈多才的肩膀，這才帶了笑容向後院裹走來。他看透了賈多才的態度，是非娶這位姑娘不可的。把這媒人作成功，討他一個歡喜，也許他要報答我這番恩情，就和我找好一件事了。（一○三）</p>
<h3 id="c180">勾臉 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 無邊</p>
<p>「勾臉」，是伶官們的專門藝術的一種，而伶官們對於這項勾臉的技巧，也大都是苦心孤詣，煞費手續，照譜勾描，决不肯稍有忽視，因爲勾臉的逼眞與否，關係演出時的襯托，和博得觀衆們的喜怒哀樂是很密切的。譬如舞台上的奸佞險惡，忠正善良，令人一望而知這是奸佞險惡，這是忠正善良，同時，分别表顯其同情與共鳴，那所勾的臉要佔上大一半的透露的力量，所以，學伶官的，那一檢「臉譜」，老先生是無有不授，他本人也無有不學的。</p>
<p>其實，「勾臉，」已不止是伶官們的專有藝術，特具的技巧；在這個社會上，凡是平常的一切人類，自然尤其是不平常的一類人物，都也同有這一套藝術的技巧，不過伶官們的勾臉，是有着老先生的指敎，有着臉譜的依據，並有着色彩的點染，所以這一種勾臉，是死的，刻版式的。不像我們平常人與不平常人的勾臉，是活的，隨機應變的。因爲我們平常人與不平常人的勾臉，一無老先生的指敎，再無臉譜的依據，全憑自己觸類旁通，心領神會，所以也不必假藉色彩來點染，而所表現與透示出來，往往比了色彩點染的更有力量而更着神效也不平常些，平常人勾的臉，他的力量的神效，自然也較平常些。然而，勾不平常臉的不平常人，必須經過平常人勾平常臉的一個階段，換句話說；先由平常人勾平常臉，而後可以達到不平常人勾不平常臉，不過，這都非所語於那些笨伯蠢漢者。</p>
<p>在這個社會上，眞可說一句勾臉之爲用大矣哉，給你說個大槪吧；凡是高官顯爵，洋房汽車，黃金美人，以及種種好聽的名銜如什麽「家」等，都可在這臉的勾出來兌換到手。再如；你同時見到一個××，一個乞丐，你爲甚麽對××是尊敬，而對乞丐却鄙厭呢？就爲××能勾臉，乞丐却不能勾臉呀。</p>
<p>「勾臉」之爲用大矣哉，在這個社會上。</p>

<p>這時，公園裹不獨碰不着一個什麽游人，連樹上的小鳥兒都還一聲不響地睡着。甬道上的一排老樹，樹葉都脫了，這伸出的椏枝顯得是十分細瘦，菊花早給冬風帶走了，只剩下一片衰黃的草還戴着昨夜的露珠發出一夥一夥，亮晶晶的光芒。黃浦江是靜悄悄的，江面籠罩着像輕烟似的曉霧，望去分不出水和天，再點綴幾隻小汽船隠隠約約在濃霧中蠕動，更是活像一幅水墨畫。</p>
<p>不久，景色忽然變動了，那盤大的朝陽，披上了紅袍，光耀萬丈，在東邊角上露出半面來，那萬道金光，把籠罩着江南的烟霧都射散了，江水頓時容光煥發。對江的一切房屋，工廠的烟囱，樹林都現出顯明的輪廓來。而回首看外灘花園，也點得滿身光彩。一隻海鷗戴着日光比箭還急的從江面掠過，正似詩人所贊嘆；「美哉！人生之朝，樂哉！人生之朝。」的感覺，使人領受朝陽無限的恩惠。</p>
<p>一切都像熟睡中醒來一般，寂寞的空氣忽變成十分𤍠閙。黃浦江上的小汽船的汽笛聲在呌，馬路上的電車的輪步　也在呌。樹上的小鳥兒更呌得婉轉動聽。呌聲中，遊人已絡絡續續進來的不少，有散步的，有打拳的，有行深呼吸的，他們大槪都是「衛生家」吧？</p>
<p>这時，外灘公園裹是顯得十分𤍠閙了。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>第二十章　射圃</p>
<p>太后這次東幸的目的，原是偏重於遊覽奉天城内外各處與歷史有關係的勝跡，實在毫無絲毫政治作用；因此伊在遊覽過狐仙塔之後，又决意要上先前淸朝還不曾入關的時候，歷代的统治者所常在那裹練習弓馬的射圃中去走一遭。（所謂射圃，也就是獵塲。但據譯者多方詢問結果，此射圃應在奉天東陵，而且範圍很小，和這裹所說的不同。除此以外，奉天便别無固定的獵塲了！所以這一章裹面所講的情節，大槪是作者自己虛搆的；不過其中也有幾段確是眞實的掌故。）這射圃的地位是約在奉天城外的西北方，從盛京的宮院出發，經過的路程是很遠的，坐着轎子前去，要費很多的時候。它的面積非常遼闊，約莫有一二十里的方　。裹面有一半是森林，林中的樹木，多半是很高大的當綠葉的喬木，所以樹蔭是極其濃密的。在奉天一帶的山地上，這樣大的森林，却並不算希罕，差不多到處可以見到：不像在中原各省中，較大的樹木，無不給人砍去作燃料，再也聚不成什麽森林</p>
<p>這一所射圃的歷史委實是悠久極了！在我們滿洲這一部份的中華民族的勢力還没有强盛起來之前，就是在不曾統一中國，祇是一個僻　邊境的部落的時候，它已經很重要地存在着了。（二一三）</p>

<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>我們從衛生上說起來，内衣（襯衫）的質地，以粗而柔軟的棉織品爲最宜，然而依時節氣候而不同的。現在已到了冬季，對於衣服的基礎知識，應當明白，就是所穿衣服材料的性質，與身體的關係，是什麽樣的？普通衣服的質地，分爲平面的經緯的彈力，與立體的厚的彈力二種，立體的厚的彈力，就是壓縮彈力，其質地的保温力與含氣量，有密切的關係，但因纖維自身的彈力，質地的組織，纖維與絲線所走的方向而有差異，羊毛駝毛等毛織品，富於保温力，麻與綢則很少，所以夏葛而冬麥，不過在同一的原料中，其所織條理粗大的，與似編織物樣子，其線路在質地表面多走直角的方向部分的，或浮鬆起來的以及起毛等，那更富於壓縮彈性。現在把衣服的質地仔細調查起來，其内部的間𨻶中，留有很少的空氣，雖用很緻密的方法編織而成，但含氣量多在百分之四十以上，普通爲百分之六。以上，八下以下，極粗而起毛絨的絨布，含有百分之九十的空氣，所以有壓縮彈性的材料，其含氣量必多，我們的身體，到了冬季，因爲外氣的温度，比體温爲低時，那身體的體温，爲外氣所奪云，就覺到寒冷，若是氣温降到十五度時，手足就要僵凍，這時在衣服内的温度，用温度表測量起來，體温爲三六·五度，毛織物内衣的表面爲二八·五度，外衣的表面爲一九·四度，所以冬季多穿衣服，其重之的温度，漸次不同的，外衣比中衣爲低，中衣比内衣爲低，内衣保温的材料，與皮膚温度關係甚大，爲什麽呢？原來我們所穿的衣服，並非衣服具有暖氣，是衣服中所保有的空氣而暖的，衣服譬如房屋的牆壁，内衣的襟袖寬大，容易失去皮膚的温度，因此冬季的内衣，第一要緊貼皮膚，少傳𤍠性第二少通氣性，不易放散温度，穿衛生衣與絨布内衣與毛線衫，最宜於保温。傳𤍠性的原料，凤麻綢爲最大，毛絨等最小，不過緊貼皮膚，於衛生上很不相宜，爲什麽呢？我們的皮膚，時常放散水蒸氣與炭酸瓦斯，若過於緊貼，就發生障碍，阻止身體機能的活動，冬季穿了毛線絨絲線皮貨等衣，因爲含氣量甚富，免得體温可以緩緩散出，而且衣服内的含氣量，具有濕潤性，這濕潤性有保温的効力，濕潤性就是吸收的濕氣，麻綢，吸濕力很快，放濕力亦快，因此奪身體的體温亦快，毛織品與皮貨，適得其反，這就是夏葛冬裘的原理。近來都會中常常看見缺乏常識自以爲摩登的蠢徒以綢爲冬季的内衣，表示闊綽的意思，其實反爲人所輕視，暴露其没有穿衣服的常識了。抑有言者，衣服質地的原料，照上面所說，一要含氣量豐富，二要通氣性少，三要有濕潤性，但是原料的纖維種類，其織法順逆，與織地的粗細，很有關係，纖維順勢織成的材料，最易傳𤍠通氣，織地粗糙的布（如藥房所售的紗布）宜於做内衣，因爲有壓縮彈性，能够保温的。</p>

<p>— 汪企張演講　陳生白江晦鳴筆記</p>
<p>現在的中國醫學敎育</p>
<p>現今的社會上有没有認識得很淸楚而去學外國的學問的人呢？大槪十分之七八·還是牢守着旣有中國固有的舊醫學，何必要學外國的醫學；眞正能矢志要拿外國的科學醫學，來同化中國的固有醫學的人，實不易見。所以直到現在關於科學醫敎育的機關，差不多有三分之二是由外國人所創辦，或藉外國人的力補助。這種非自動的，不覺悟的文化的輸入，簡直是被侵略的殖民敎育｜｜異化敎育；而不是自動的自主的國民敎育｜｜同化敎育。</p>
<p>試看美國之於菲律濱，什麽都是美國化。在表面上看：菲列濱將要成美國的第二，而成爲世界上一大强盛的國家了。可惜，菲列濱受的美國敎育，乃是奴化敎育，殖民敎育，祗已形成了美國在東亞的根據地！同樣的舉動，安南是法化了，臺灣朝鮮是日化了。我們知道：要人家來敎育，要人家來帮忙，人家願意犠牲；祗要這願意犠牲的人不是痴子，我敢說那人家一定有企圖，不是爭權，就是求利，眞實的不轉念頭來犠牲，那是一定没有的。這話也許我說得太激了。</p>
<p>關於這樣的例子狠多，如上海租界上的學校，他們所造就出來的人才，不能說是少；可是，對於我們中國可謂絲毫無益，並且有害，這他出身的人，不能爲中國做事業，只有做洋行的買辦，冩字間的僱員，巡捕房裹的翻譯，爲虎作倀的一類工作。我們看外國人拿中國人的錢，敎育中國人的子弟，不能說他們不肯犠牲吧？實際上，他們的企圖，爲他們自己，不是爲我們中國。所以凡是中國人都應該知道，這不是爲我們中國敎育國民，是端送中國許多國民。有人說：學術管學術，政治管政治，這是根本錯誤的。不過，學術與政治，其中是有直接和間接的關係，但學術與政治是不能離開的。譬如科學家發明了一件東西，當然，這是所謂學術上的貢獻，可是在他發明以後，就給與本國以經濟上，政治上莫大的帮助。看：化學的進步就會有化學戰爭的發生；器械的進步，就有坦克車迫擊砲的出現。不知這種利器，爲我用，可保國。爲人用，可亡國　　　　一回想，就可以曉得：人家爲你敎育，爲你犠牲，爲你化掉功夫，爲你費　　錢，無非要養成一批桀犬，這批桀犬，會不會明白國家原理？會不會淸楚自己地位？偉大莊嚴的國際聯盟，是什麽的背景？什麽的作用？明眼人當然可以看透他的黑幕的。所以我覺得我們中國現在的醫學敎育，大多數還是依賴人家的敎育。仍是趨於異化的傾向，前途是狠危險的。譬如喜歡英美的，一心一念要將中國變做英美，喜歡法國的要將中國變做法國，也許喜歡德日的要將中國變做德日，……抱這樣的希望，倘有一天果然滿足了他們各個企求的慾望時，中國已不是中國的中國，却已變成了外國的中國。</p>
<p>五　將來的中國醫學敎育</p>
<p>我們旣覺得自己的程度不够，同時又感想到專門摹仿人家的不澈底，那末怎樣去應付今後的醫育問題呢？因爲自己的學問幼稚，當然我們不能不學習他們外國的學問，假使我們不能認識他們的文字，那我們就不能明白他們學術的内容。我們要認淸，我們不妨去學習他們的文字和學術，但我們是要拿它來同化，並不是拿它來異化。我們就是看了外國的東西若是比我們的好，我們喜歡它，佩服它，而去學它，並廢掉我們所不好的地方都可能；但是我們要認淸，我們要學它，不是就變它，假使也變成了它，而被他們所異化，那就糟了！</p>
<p>（甲）國民敎育的重要　這裹我們要進一步討論，怎樣才可以避免異化呢？</p>
<p>我以爲最要緊的是要打定國民敎育的根基。若是國民敎育没有根基，那就不能學外國的學術，用外國的東西。因爲國民敎育有了根基，纔可以避免外國化，就可以拿外國的東西來同化，可以拿外國的學問歸爲己有，使本國受莫大的利益，甚而能够使超越外國的東西發揚國粹，所以卽使進了外國的某學校，受了外國的敎育也不會外國化。倘然没有良好國民敎育根基的人，無論他怎樣好學，怎樣聰明，其結果雖然他的面貌，姓名，國籍是中國人，其實已經是外國化，已經是外國人了。</p>
<p>敎育家有言曰：「普通敎育卽國民敎育，國民敎育有根底，始有學術敎育，若是没有國民敎育，卽無學術敎育」。</p>
<p>過去中國的留學生之留學國外的，更僕難數。而其結果也祗有會講幾句外國話，會穿幾套洋裝，會用外國的東西，會受外國人的驅使，會替外國增加經濟上政治上侵略和力量，這樣壞現象，都是没有受過良好的自主的國民敎育的原故。這正是中國學術敎育前途絶大的危機！</p>
<p>所以我個人主張，以爲中國的國民敎育有根底，中國醫學敎育的前途才有希望，中國的醫學敎育才有效果；否則中國醫育祗有每况愈下，中國醫學敎育前途祗是不堪設想的。</p>
<p>爲了看淸這一點，若照目下的敎育的方針，我以爲中國政府，簡直不必派　留學生出洋，使他們洋化了，來做中國人的外國先生；敎出許多同外國人一樣的洋化人物，例如直捷爽快的延聘外國人，來華主敎，反可省却許多麻煩，較爲得策嗎？</p>
<p>（乙）學習外來文化應有之階段　我們學習外國的文化，可以分爲三個階段：</p>
<p>第一期｜｜學他的樣子，不是學他的骨子。譬如穿西裝，我們祗可以學他的樣子，西裝的原料，還是要用國貨，却不可用外國貨被他異化；假使穿了中國裝而用外國貨的原料，其結果也是等於異化。所以我們拿外國的東西搬入中國，我們只要拿他的文字當作記號，不要拿外國字來代表中國字，把外國文當</p>

<p>— 楊任遠</p>
<p>高橋的衛生事務所（原名高橋鄕村衛生模範區）的鄕村衛生工作，在現中國衛生事業中，佔有想當的地位，無庸再來介紹。</p>
<p>去年底，該所所長張維及主持人朱邦仁賴斗岩等博士，以現在衛生敎育普及到民間去的需要，和農村破產請不起醫生的事實，就利用他能一面學一面做的環境中，呈請市衛生局核准附設了一班公共衛生助理員訓練班。在這到處是貧病交迫科學醫生缺乏的今日，農村中，這種訓練班的舉辦，無論是在社會的改造，民族的前途，都有多多提倡的必要，茲特拉雜記錄於後，以供研究我國衛生事業諸公的參考。</p>
<p>該訓練班旣不和普通在門診内換藥的助理員相同，也不像副牌的護士，訓練的宗旨是呌他們將來到那請不起醫生而且不一定需要醫生去做的鄕間去做那預防工作，學校衛生，家庭訪視，宣傳衛生敎育等等的衛生工作，所以就呌公共衛生助理員訓練班。</p>
<p>他們爲怕招了一般少爺小姐式的人來，訓練出來學非所用，所以在招考時第一注意的就是要有苦幹的精神，最好是在鄕村長大的靑年，因爲在鄕村長大才知道鄕村的情形和痛苦，將來才願意回老家去服服貼貼的苦幹。</p>
<p>招考的大約情形是有初中程度及有同等學力者，均得入學，定一年期滿，上半年爲訓練期，下半年爲實習期，在訓練期間，津貼生活費，如機關保送，則由該機關津貼。因爲初次試辦性質，所以限招八名，後來各方請求者多，故額外加三名，共十一名，遂於今年一月一日開始上課。</p>
<p>敎學的方式是學了就去做，從做事情上再求進一步的實用學識，譬如今天上午上學校衛生，下午就去學校中做帮助體格檢查及訓練學生，有什麽問題再帶回來解决。</p>
<p>所上的課目是解剖，生理，病理，細菌學，消毒法，傳染病，急救，藥物學，防疫，綳帶術，學校衛生，環境衛生，工廠衛生，婦孺衛生，社會調查，統計學，護病學，家庭訪視，及應用文（包括倫理學社會學英文國文等課目）隨事實的需要而敎以大槪，因爲不希望去治療，所以除急救術及應用普通藥品外，關於治療的科不敎，其餘時間，都爲實地工作和討論問題。</p>
<p>上半年的課在六月底結束，於七月一日起，隨各人興趣所長，分派各鄕區實習，而且在這很短的時間中，已有了相當的成績。</p>
<p>我們平心靜氣的研究一下，在這公共衛生幼稚到極點科學醫生缺乏而且多半不肯下鄕，農民害了病找不到醫生治的現狀中，這種人才，着實可以預防疾病，减少鄕民的痛苦，補救這過渡時期的中國：另一方面又可爲普及衛生敎育使人民信仰科學醫藥的先鋒，我以爲很切合於現在社會的需要的。</p>

<p>作中國文，我們要應用他的理論，明瞭他們的内容，用中國文字來冩出，使他變成中國的學術，纔算得是同化；不然，我們學外國人，我們自己也都變成外國人，如此異化，那是狠危險的。</p>
<p>第二期｜｜到這一個時期，我們不必用外國的文字，不必請外國的敎授，不必用外國的器械，因爲我們已經學到了外國的法門，得着了他們的精藴，可以利用本國的原料，本國的人才，照樣可以製造出一種獨立的學術。</p>
<p>第三期｜｜利用同化以後的學術，作進一步的研究，來與外國競爭，好呌外國也來吸收中國的文化，而使他取我所有的法同化，以達彼此交換的目的。</p>
<p>我們試用檢閱我國的醫學敎育：過去旣是以外國侵略的關係，而成了被動的醫學敎育。現在，還是没有脫離洋化的勢力，還是純粹外國化的醫學。這樣情形，就連上述的學習外來文化的階段，第一二兩期都没有逃過，當然不能謀醫學的獨立，祗有始終滯留在十分危險的異化境地</p>
<p>諸位也許有是將來中國的醫學領導者，我所希望於諸位的：</p>
<p>（一）國民敎育的根基是不可不打，外國文是不可不懂，因爲這是落　國家吸收學術的先决條件。</p>
<p>（二）當吸收了外國學術以後，應當精細的咀嚼，要使它溶化，不要囫圇呑下去。我記得覃振先生從歐美考察司法歸來，曾發表了這樣的談話：「拿人家的法律，就來拍合到中國，是不行的，我們不必說學他學不像，因爲我們本來不一定要和他一樣。」我是十分同情的。</p>
<p>六　結論</p>
<p>中國的醫學敎育：過去｜｜不足道！現在｜｜狠危險！</p>
<p>將來｜｜要認淸外國人的背景和作用，要確定自己的主張，要確定學習外國文化的目標，要吸收外國的精華來中國化，不是崇拜外國的文化，而變成外國化。</p>
<p>外國的文字，只可認爲學習外國文化的紀號，根本不和整個敎育前途相關，爲中國敎育切身問題，尤其是醫育前途計，還是應當着重於國民敎育的需要。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　｜｜完了｜｜</p>
<p>難，焉能談擴充設備，是以標本之採集，全賴吾同學之自行努力耳，醫學首重實習，如基本學課中之解剖學。尤非僅事書本閱讀，名詞記憶，卽能了解者，必須實行剖解，睹其實際，庶可明晰眞相，南通地方，過去本爲州郡，關於盜匪犯罪之執行槍斃者，年亦不少，按政府通令，無家屬屍體可發給當地醫學機關解剖實習之用，徒以通地民智未開（或許整個中國皆然，）且過去敝院領取屍體，實行解剖後，通縣政府，曾遭非難，於是近年以來，每次槍斃之屍體，雖確無家屬，經敝院多次接洽，負責機關，輒巧施辭令以卸其責，職是之故，吾同學之所賴以作爲解剖標本者，僅荒塚野墳中之暴露之骨骼耳。</p>
<p>週前敝院同學，在敝校農學院畜牧塲之荒塚上，拾取骨骼標本，竟不見諒於鄕民，報吿公安機關，而公安機關，亦復實行扣留，且送法院處辦，幸法院能體念研究科學之純正本旨，主從輕處理，不料社會上匪特不從中解釋誤會，反虛構事實者有之，妄加非難者亦有之，此吾人爲醫學前途計，爲人類幸福計，不能不爲之深痛，尤不能不有所申述也。</p>
<p>夫醫學所以治病救人者也，欲求治病，首宜有正確之診斷，針炙藥石之治療，在其次也，無論診斷，無論治療，非先明瞭吾人之身體結構以及其生理病理狀况不爲功，生理解剖，所以明解剖臟腑位置，組織構造者也，病理解剖，所以察疾病原因，變化情况者也，骨骼，爲生理解剖之基礎者，先知骨骼之結構，然後知臟器之位置，筋肉靱帶之附着，血管神經之經由，自此更進而究生理病理之奥妙，考定疾病之所屬而治療之，庶幾易於見效也，猶諸工程師之於機器然，若不先明機器之構造，何由知機器之活動與損害，更何由言修理與改進？此西醫之所以稱爲科學醫者也，抑亦歐西醫學之所以突飛猛進，而爲我國所不及之關鍵也。</p>
<p>世人對於醫師，常希望其能精確診斷，與合理治療，而對於醫師之解剖死屍採取骨骼，竟不知諒解，矛盾孰甚？此堪注意者一。</p>
<p>就哲學上之觀察「死」乃人生最後之歸宿，死後一切，旣不能留戀，亦不需留戀，身體軀殼，何獨不然，火葬，水葬，鳥葬，獸葬，以及厚其棺槨，麗其衣衾，裝築其墳地，對於死者，有何異哉？不過聊慰生者而已耳，此堪注意者二</p>
<p>聞歸鳥有，與其與草木同腐，何不貢獻其軀體，供醫學界之研究，化無用爲有用，以求醫學之發展，而謀人羣之幸福？此堪注意者三。</p>
<p>卽退一步而就事實言，該荒塚本屬敝校農學院之畜牧塲，旣乏家屬，且無人管理，平日白骨狼藉，任牲畜之踐踏，何以吾人採集作爲標本，則指爲不當？巧言慈善更屬滑𥡴，此堪注意者四。</p>
<p>總之，此次事實，所謂主犯（實則不能稱犯）者，其𤍠心科學之精神，固堪欽佩，卽其從事工作之舉動，亦無何等不當之處，鄕民誤於傳統觀念，迷於神怪邪說，情猶可諒，惟社會人士，反虛搆其辭，加以非難，誠爲吾人之所不解，而深感痛惜者也。</p>
<p>泰東西諸國，對於屍體剖解，骨骼採集，早已成爲司空見慣之舉，宜乎其醫學蒸蒸日上，長足進展，而非吾國所能望其肩背者也。</p>
<p>我國自數千年來，宗法觀念，根深蒂固，服喪厚殮，目爲人倫大事，毁屍傷體，視若叛逆行爲，積習旣久，革除自屬匪易，惟爲醫學前途，人類幸福計，著者敢提出下列幾項意見，以求社會人士之指正與採納。</p>
<p>（一）政府當局，應從速釐定並實行確切之條例，以保護並奬勵屍體解剖之研究。</p>
<p>（二）輿論界應隨時以公正立塲，論述醫學解剖之價値，並糾正民衆之腐敗錯誤觀念。</p>
<p>（三）智識分子，應以身作則，抱大無畏之精神，將個人或家屬屍骸，貢獻供醫學之解剖，以資提倡。</p>
<p>（四）醫學界應團結努力，以督促政府帮助輿論界，剷除民衆之錯誤觀念，尤須尊重被解剖之屍體，詳加研究，以符實際。</p>
<p>以上所舉數端，如能各盡其責，實事而力行之，則積習可除，醫學前途，民衆幸福，實利賴之。</p>

<p>（四十九）腸壅塞症（下）</p>
<p>（問）　絞窄性腸壅塞症，除了前述的病狀外，還有什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）　細菌，除蠶食腸壁外，還能侵及腸間膜。發病，大都突然起腦震盪症狀，疼痛很猛烈，腹部全體都感到的。嘔吐，也很劇烈，每天有一二十回，混以膽汁。然少糞臭和糞色。腹壁很緊張，但膨滿度却輕微；又局部有抵抗，壓痛而膨隆。</p>
<p>（問）　麻痺性腸壅塞症的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　和閉鎖性腸壅塞症相同。鼓腸有限局性的。疼痛因爲原因的病變而引起的。嘔吐的發現很遲。腸内没有雜音。</p>
<p>（問）　痙攣性腸壅塞症，病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　雖也和閉鎖性腸壅塞症相似，但没有吐糞和腦震盪症，疼痛也輕，全身狀態，也比較的佳良。</p>
<p>（問）　腸壅塞症的治療法，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）　要看所發的病情而行各别的治療方法</p>
<p>（問）　病人的食物，應該怎樣注意？</p>
<p>（答）　凡急性閉塞，應該絶食。次急性的，可吃少量不致積滯於腸内的食物像牛乳，奶粉之類。慢性的狹窄，可吃少量富於滋養的没有渣滓的食物。</p>
<p>（問）　食物須得禁忌的，是那幾種？</p>
<p>（答）　必須禁忌的，是易起便秘的食物和藥劑像濃茶，膠狀食物，含有石灰質的食物，鉍製劑等。還有發生氣體的飲食物，像炭酸飲料，馬鈴薯等。</p>
<p>（問）　腹部疼痛和緊張的時候怎樣處置？</p>
<p>（答）　可行腹部温　法。</p>
<p>（問）　口渴很劇烈時，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　可含氷塊在口中，或用𤍠茶含漱口内。食鹽水注射，也很有效。</p>
<p>（問）　腸蠕動而疼痛嘔吐的時候，可否用鴉片劑？</p>
<p>（答）　可用。但在麻痺性腸壅塞症，却絶對禁忌。</p>
<p>（問）　洗胃，有没有效力？</p>
<p>（答）　洗胃，很是有效。這不但可以减少腸内所逆上的内容，並且可以除去自體中毒現象。</p>
<p>（問）　電氣療法對於本病是怎樣施行的？</p>
<p>（答）　先用生理食鹽水一百公分注腸内，用直腸導子（陰極）揷入，通以直流電十五分鐘（一○到一五毫安培。）對於麻痺性的腹壅塞症，最爲適宜。</p>
<p>（問）　外科的手術，是在什麽時候必須施行的？</p>
<p>（答）　若發病後二十四小時内治療無效，祇有行外科開腹手術。尤其對於絞窄性腸壅塞症，開腹愈早愈妙。（完）</p>

<p>（五）專門的診斷｜｜鐵勃固靈反應</p>
<p>肺結核症的診斷，以痰中發現結核菌爲最凖確可靠，這一種情形，上面已經講過了！但是這種證明，並不是個個患者都容易得着的。甚至臨床上諸重要症象，像咳血，咳嗽，温度增高，消瘦等；有時都完全缺乏，但結果也會確定他是患本症的。這方面的收穫，係除開上述的種種檢查外，另有一種專門的診斷方法的；這就是現在所述的鐵勃固靈（結核菌素）了！</p>
<p>「鐵勃固靈」是什麽呢？他是用結核桿菌提鍊製成，爲細菌學先導大師考后最先發明的；故又有「結核菌素」的名稱。他在本病的治療上，應用是很廣闊，並且有相當的成績可暗的；此中的詳情，在後面係另有專章叙述的。此外，在診斷一方面，當本症在早期開始的時候，臨床上種種症象都没有顯著，醫者是否的决斷，也正涉疑似之間的；但如果病者係發現鐵勃固靈的正號反應了，這一個難題，差不多馬上就會解决的！病症的認識旣淸，對於正當的療治方針，當然也可以從速下手了！這是一舉兩得的事情，其給與病者醫家雙方便利的地方，我想誰也不致否認的。</p>
<p>鐵勃固靈的反應是如何的呢？他係分爲局部病灶和全身三方面的。局部的反應是指鐵勃固靈接種或注射穿刺的地方而言，大半會發生腫脹和疼痛狀態的。病灶的反應係指病灶内增加紅腫呈炎性反應之謂。這在皮膚結核方面的狼瘡症，是一個狠顯著的例子；在肺結核症，當然是看不出的。但在臨床上，也有咳嗽加劇，痰量增多，濁音水泡音增盛，等種種症象的。全身的反應中，以體温上昇爲最顯著的證明。祇須較尋常上昇半度（攝氏），卽可當作陽性反應。此上昇大槪在注射後六時或八時卽會發生，至廿四小時後達最高度（可至攝氏三十九或四十度），然後在二三日間，緩緩下降，以至恢復未注射前狀况。除體温上昇外，若頭痛，煩燥不安，惡心，嘔吐，等症象，大半都會同時發生的。｜｜這三方面陽性反應的發現，大槪在七八小時後，遲至十至十二小時之間；如果係在數日後發生，則我們可簡接的說，是和鐵勃固靈的接種或注射没有關係的。</p>

<p>（二十九）實扶的里（俗稱白喉）（續）</p>
<p>▲實扶的里的預防法</p>
<p>實扶的里，旣然公認爲是一種由實扶的里桿菌感染的傳染病。當然也要依照一般傳染病的規定。立刻送入傳染病院。施行隔離。但是在事實上講起來。未必個個可以辦得到。因爲有時候家長不願將患病兒童送入病院。施行隔離醫治。所以大都卽在家庭中施行隔離。延醫診治。此時切不可與病人共同食宿。尤以兒童爲然。寢室務須常使空氣流通。能得日光直接照射更良。一切用具，玩具，和寢室。當用消毒藥液謹愼消毒。若能用蒸氣消毒。則更佳。再口腔衛生亦屬緊要。可用滅菌藥水常常漱口。至於注射預防血淸一層。須經醫師診察後。始可注射。但是因爲經過相當日期後。他的防禦力卽可消失。所以一般人往往不願注射。</p>
<p>▲實扶的里的治療法</p>
<p>實扶的里惟一的特效治療法。就是注射實扶的里血淸。無論其爲咽頭實扶的里，喉頭實扶的里，或鼻腔實扶的里。如果得着確實的診斷。立刻就應注射實扶的里血淸。注射愈早。見效愈速。血淸的分量。是用單位計算。單位的多少。是依發病的日期，病的輕重，病人的年齡，和體質而定。普通對於喉頭實扶的里的血淸注射單位。總在一萬以上。照我們醫師的經騐上講起來。與其失在注射單位少的時候。　可失在注射單位多的時候。關於這一點。當然主治醫師可以斟酌情形注射。儘可毋慮。當血淸注射的時候，和他注射的後來。往往發生兩種病症。這種病症，並不是每次注射必定發生的。現將這兩種病症的現象。大略說一說如左。</p>
<p>（一）過敏症　在一星期前。曾經注射血淸過的人。如果再行第二次血淸注射。屢有發生激烈可怖的反應。有時竟可危及生命。（卽使第一次血淸注射。遠在數年前。亦然如此。）所幸預防這種可畏的過敏症。尙稱簡便。就是在注射的時候。應當先用極少量注入。經過半小時或一小時後。如無反應。再用稍多量注入。再經半小時或一小時後。始可注入全量。其所以分次注射的緣故。因爲可以預先麻鈍患者的過敏性。如此分次注射。大槪可免遭遇上述的危險。現在一般有經騐的醫師。在注射各種血淸的時候。一定要先問有否注射過血淸。或逕施行分次注射。無非也就是要想預先防備這種過敏症啊。</p>
<p>（二）血淸病　這個血淸病，不是專門發在實扶的里血淸。就是其他血淸。也可發生的。他的病象。卽在血淸注射後一星期左右。常常從顏面，軀幹，以至四肢。發生赤色指頭大蕁麻疹樣的斑點。瘙癢劇烈。頗以爲苦。同時𤍠度亦復上昇。因此往往引起病人及家屬的恐懼。其實我敢擔保無礙。也更談不到生命的危險。大抵經過三四日。多至一週。卽可𤍠降疹褪。恢復健康。如果給與下劑和鈣劑。那就他的治愈日期。更爲迅速。</p>
<p>再喉頭實扶的里，若已陷入窒息狀態。而不及注射血淸。或已注射血淸，而呼吸困難更形劇烈的時候。當卽斷然施行氣管切開。另闢氣道。急謀呼吸。以救萬一。往往可使窒息狀紫藍色的容貌。由數次通暢的呼吸。變爲紅潤色。而挽回將絶的生命。惜乎一般家屬。大都不願將兒童受此手術。實可嘆啊（完）</p>

<p>瘧疾發作，體内𤍠度驟高，達攝氏表四十度左右，末稍血管收縮，血量减少，故惡寒戰慄，粟肌闘牙，皮膚蒼白厥冷，口唇指尖悉呈靑色，其經過平均約一二時，繼因𤍠達極度，血液向末稍血管流注，故皮膚灼𤍠，面紅口渴，脾臟充血腫大，聽診心臟，聞𤍠性收縮雜音，其經過平均約三四時，終　體内𤍠降，末稍血管擴張，故遍體發汗，尿量漸增，脾臟縮小，諸症緩解，其經過平均約二三時，漸次恢復常態，俟再逢瘧虫成熟分裂，芽蚴潰入血中，續見發作，但發作時間，略有遲早之差，故有前進或後進之稱。</p>
<p>除寒𤍠發作外，血中紅血球及血色素减少，引起貧血，檢查血液，紅血球中能證明嗜鹽基性質粒，移行型及大單核白血球增加，往往全身骨節疫痛，或發現匐行疹及薔薇疹，或因氣道發炎引起咳嗽，當惡寒期，皮膚乾燥，知覺鈍麻，脈搏頻細，呼吸促迫，當灼𤍠發汗期，皮膚潮紅，知覺過敏，脈搏充實，呼吸頻數，間有呈重複脈者，在神經系統，常呈頭痛，神經痛，痙攣，麻痺，昏睡，舉動變調等症狀，在消化系統，常呈胃痛，黃疸，惡心，嘔吐，下痢，噯氣，食慾不振等症狀，當發作休息時，尿中每含有烏羅比林。（Ursbilin）</p>
<p>(二)惡瘧　惡瘧症勢較劇，常致重症貧血及瘧惡液質，多發生於𤍠帶各地，潛伏期約五至十日，當初次發作後，紅血球中卽能證明嗜鹽基性顆粒，其瘧原虫成熟不齊，故發𤍠無定時，或按日，或隔日，或一日數次，屢寒寒𤍠，或無寒無汗，𤍠久不退，甚至𤍠未降至常度卽繼起發作，因之有𤍠帶𤍠日發瘧，子午瘧，夏秋𤍠等稱，以其屢呈嗜眠，昏睡，譫語，狂躁，痙攣，麻痺，吐潟，厥冷，黃疸，胃痛，血壓下降，虛脫，失神，血尿等異常症象，故又有昏睡性，譫妄性，霍亂性，黃疸性，胃痛性，厥冷性，失神性，血尿性等惡瘧之分。</p>
<p>（三）假面瘧慢性及瘧惡液質　假面瘧𤍠甚輕微，或無𤍠，常感三叉，後頭，肋間，腰腹，内臟各部神經痛，定期發作，脾臟腫大，間呈半身不隨，失神，痙攣，浮腫，發疹，眩暈，氣道炎，胃腸炎等症狀，慢性瘧多由惡瘧轉成，或間日瘧三日瘧療治不適所致，𤍠輕而無定型，皮色黃晦，貧血，氣促，脾肝腫大，間呈胃腸炎，氣道炎，腎臟炎，血管硬化等症狀，瘧惡液質，症勢益危，多續發於惡瘧或慢性瘧，面如土色，四肢末端或全體浮腫，皮膚及粘膜極易出血，往往黃疸，腹水，及神經，循環，呼吸，消化各系統之症狀，接踵發生，衰耗致斃。</p>
<p>（四）黑水𤍠�水熱為瘧疾之異型症，係由多數紅血球急劇崩潰所致，每以奎寗治瘧爲其誘因，多見於𤍠帶各地，我國雲南廣東福建，各省，間亦發生，通常於服奎寗後數時内，突然惡寒，戰慄，頭脊疼痛，惡心，嘔吐，體温驟昇至攝氏表四十度以上，并呈黃疸，血尿，血便，皮下溢血，肝脾腫大等症狀，尿呈醬油　黑褐色，比重達一·○三○至一·○三五，含有多量蛋白質，腎臟上皮細胞及血色素，重症者，意識溷濁，呼吸困難，每於發作期内因心臟衰弱致死，輕症者，發作後數時間内，諸症减退，但反復發作者仍屬危險。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c235">理想與現實 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 任白戈</p>
<p>我曾經在什麽地方見過這樣的話：「結婚是一座被包圍的城，在外面的人很想跑進去看一看，在裹面的人又很想逃出來。」這幾句話，在過去，我是覺得有趣，到現在，聽了許多已結婚的朋友們底長呼與短嘆，我更覺得頗堪玩味了。</p>
<p>人生，眞也像探訪勝蹟的旅行一樣；當還没有達到某個目的地的時候，心中總是橫溢着無限的𤍠慕與渴念；一旦達到了某個目的地以後，心中乃只剩下了一抺的空虛與淡漠。結婚這一座被包圍的城，不過是在全程旅行中難於多次探訪的名城吧，我們很可以將這幾句話推廣到人生的一切階段中來玩味哩！有許多人還會這樣地想。</p>
<p>這種想法是很普遍的。我們底一般的民間不是都早已流行着許多同樣地頗堪玩味的話了嗎？例如所謂「這山看着那山高」和「遠處泉水清，近處泉水濁」等等這一類話就是。在大雅之堂裹，我們底紳士淑女們還另用着一種時髦話來表現；理想是美麗的，現實是醜惡的，至少現實總没有理想那樣美麗；所以人們都追求着理想而不滿於現實，常常在那理想與現實之間跑進與逃出。</p>
<p>在眞的是醜惡的現實社會中，要說現實總没有理想那樣美麗，本來並没有什麽不可以；就是說人們都追求着理想而不滿於現實也是可以的，只是不可將這幾句話底意思拿來絶對化和永遠化。我們底紳士淑女們却往往愛將一切的槪念絶對化和永遠化。依照他們底邏輯，這幾句話便可以簡直這樣地說：現實永遠都没有理想那樣美麗，而一切的理想都比現實美麗。歸根結底，他們必然以爲理想與現實底美麗與醜惡底來源主要的是在所謂喜新好奇的人性。人們爲什麽都追求着理想而不滿於現實呢？那是由於人性自身底喜新好奇，並不是理想和現實自身具有什麽眞的令人追求和不滿的地方，只要理想一旦成了現實，就是美麗的也變成醜惡的了。這樣一來自然只要我們將喜新好奇的人性加以改革便不會再追求着理想而不滿於現實了，旣無煩惱，亦無辛苦，實在是一個安身立命的好立法。跑進與逃出不是多事嗎？</p>
<p>然而，現實究竟是非常現實的，它决不會因人性底改革而將醜惡一旦化爲美麗。要將醜惡一旦化爲美麗，却正需要人對於現實的改革。當現實自身還没有被改革得像理想那樣美麗的時候，即使我們將人性改革到一種止於至善的境地亦不能使它像理想那樣美麗。何况這個即使的假定根本就是不可能的呢。老實地說：只有將現實改革到了與理想合致的境地然後現實才不醜惡，而所謂人性底改革才同時說得上。目前，在人類底歷史還没有發展到理想的階段的時候，現實與理想底隔離完全是一個不可否認的事實，但這隔離却不是所謂什麽人性劃出來的，而是它們本身就有着。爲了除掉這隔離，所以有許多眞正地追求着理想的改革者。改革者正是以不滿於現實而追求着理想的。在這里，話便應該顚倒過來說：他們之所以不滿於現實而追求着理想，却是由於現實和理想自身眞的有令人不滿和追求的地方，决不是爲了現實和理想自身是所謂現實和理想的緣故。及到理想一旦成了現實，他們是不會也一樣不滿的。他們只有跑進，没有逃出，而且那與他們底人性還完全無關。</p>
<p>那麽，爲什麽有些人們確是常常在那理想與現實之間跑進與逃出呢？這自然是由於他們並没有認得眞正的理想和現實而只是在自己底頭腦中隨意空架了一個幻像的緣故。眞正的理想和現實是獨立於人底頭腦之外的，人只有客觀地認得了它們才能不至於迷離地在一個幻像之間跑進又逃出。不過這主要的還是由於一些人們在社會和歷史中的地位所决定。没落的封建貴族，是會思慕昔日的豪華而不滿於現實的；新興的勞苦大衆是不滿於現實而展望着將來的美景的；只有我們底紳士淑女們，旣無昔日的豪華可思慕，又無將來的美景可展望，實不能不死抱着現實不放。然而殘缺腐朽的現實，亦會使他們自身感到不滿的。怎麽辦呢？只有隨着在自己底頭腦中空架了一個幻像的理想來追求。幻像總是容易幻滅的，追求的結果自然是幻滅。幻滅了便想從現實中逃出，逃不出又想跑進另一個理想，於是始終就在所謂理想與現實之間跑進與逃出了。如果要以探訪勝蹟的旅行作爲例子來說，那所不同應該說是由於思慕昔日的豪華這一殘餘意念所致的吧。而一般遺老遺少們往往愛發「思古之幽情」大約亦是由這兒來的。</p>
<p>依然以結婚這一座被包圍的城來說吧：爲什麽在外面的人很想跑進去看一看，在裹面的人又很想逃出來呢？那就是因爲在外面的人很想跑進去取得一點什麽，在裹面的人又很想逃出來免掉恐慌和危險。只要這一座被包圍的城一旦成了自由開放的樂園，我想是再不會有人逃出來的。</p>
<h3 id="c236">趵突泉 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>未到濟南以前，便給老殘遊記上「家家泉水，户户垂楊，比江南風景，覺得更爲有趣」的話，引誘着了。因此，旣到濟南，是不得不把遊玩和好奇的𤍠望，先放在一些名泉上面的。</p>
<p>第一日便去看趵突泉。照老殘遊記上講，「這趵突泉是濟南府七十二泉中之第一泉。」而在水藻飄拂的泉中，也有頽老的灰色石碑，標出這樣第一泉的字來。</p>
<p>一進門去，是賣各種貨物的攤子，葵說，這有點像上海的蓬萊市塲哩。等到在石橋上倚着鐵欄杆看泉水時，黃瓦的呂祖殿，唱　鏵大鼓的茶館，賣小玩意和算命先生的攤子，却又給人以上海城隍廟之感了。</p>
<p>泉水約五六股，直徑均有一尺來寬，水柱似的從靑苔水藻的池中，帶着銀白的水花，翻冐起來，突出水面二尺來的光景。響聲活活地吼着，將週遭的暄囂，都一齊掩没下去。遊人的心情，也彷彿一下子從城市移到山間去了一樣。另有兩三股，並不冐出，却只像壺中的沸水似地洶湧着。其餘，則水藻靑苔間，常有白色的水泡，升了上來。所謂濟南隨地皆泉水，從這裹，大槪也可以推測出來的。</p>
<p>池前有工人從事挖掘，據說是在動工裝修自來水管，水源便以趵突泉爲根據地。呂祖殿上掛有自來水籌備會技術組的招牌，警察立在門前，禁止遊人進去。想來，在不久的異日，這第一泉卽將以其本身的實惠施及於濟南居民了，但不知那時候，來自遠地的旅人可還有一覽的眼福麽？</p>
<p>池邊的茶館，縣着唱　鏵大鼓的招牌，揭開軟的厚布簾看，内中放置舒適的籐椅，和白布罩面的小茶桌，座客不多，大都是一些中年以上的人，是時大鼓尙未開塲，客人除呆坐者外，便抑着脖子，捧着一本舊小說之類的書，喧囂，都一齊掩没下去。人覺得東方人的長閒逸豫之氣，不愉快地撲人眉宇。葵說，快走開，人家要來拖你進去哩。不知怎的，我也直感到這是個不好去的地方，彷彿一進去，人的雄心和銳氣，都會全然消去一般。</p>
<p>在賣古物的攤上，見一西洋人，摩沙審視，久久不去。莫非正如鶴見祐輔在北京的魅力一文說的「支那人的鎭靜，紆緩的心情，」已「將外國人的性急征服了」麽？但我想，那些中了東方病的，却只能歸之於「每天喫着七十三個鷄蛋」或「每天喫着一斤奶油」的外國人而已。至於在上海開公共汽車或是肩掛毛氈走衖堂的羅宋癟三，他們就未見得「以爲支那好得不堪」吧？</p>
<p>倘若没有水柱一樣的泉水，翻白地湧出，響着山中澗水似的聲音，我覺得，週遭的環象，是會完全給人以頽唐之感的。</p>
<h3 id="c237">崛强地我就挣扎起來了 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 仃</p>
<p>太陽彷彿一團火燄似的，放出它底燦爛的金光。</p>
<p>當我睜開了升火的眼睛的時候，刺辣辣地它已經射進我的眼眶里。</p>
<p>｜｜是呵我應該起來了。</p>
<p>對於自己，我悄悄地這麽說。</p>
<p>然而當我掙扎過了一會之後，仍舊還是那麽躺着。不錯，我已經疲憊得怪厲害了。肚子好象餓了的臭虫那般，空虛而且凹癟。四肢又是那麽軟癱癱的。</p>
<p>躺在一爿生滿了鐵銹的床上，把自己瘦削的身體，深深地埋葬在骯髒而破碎的被里。</p>
<p>默默地仰視着天花板上的蜘蛛。它正在活動而忙碌。</p>
<p>對於牠，我感覺自己是懦弱，是低能，是一個不中用的廢物。我没有爲生而奮鬥，努力彷彿那隻渺小的蜘蛛那樣。</p>
<p>心深已被痛苦所戕刺。由於慚愧，由於創傷，使我整個的生命惶惑起來。</p>
<p>｜｜是呵我應該起來了。</p>
<p>｜｜不錯，我非掙扎起來不可。</p>
<p>｜｜難道我能那麽老是躺着嗎？</p>
<p>我自問自答地。</p>
<p>於是我下了個决心：「媽媽的，非得掙扎起來不可！」</p>
<p>鼓着勇氣，竭了渾身九牛二虎之力，我開始拚命地。</p>
<p>我感覺一股𤍠氣，彷彿電流似的貫澈了我的全體，渾身感到火𤍠。我底臉兒好像烤鴨的皮子那樣。</p>
<p>可是，仍舊不能起來。我失望，悲哀地又靜悄悄地躺下來。</p>
<p>難堪，恥辱，恐怖，饑餓，毁滅，我咒詛着自己的生命。</p>
<p>回憶着房東向我喝吆的話及朋友們底漠不相關的態度，不覺又打了個塞噤。這是對我一種冷酷的打擊，將我的靈魂被炸得粉碎哩。</p>
<p>意識着那可怕底事情之到來，把我駭得呆呆的躺着，似乎除死以外，我没有什麽指望了。於是，深深地太息了下，對於一切，不是無望了嗎？</p>
<p>｜｜完啦！｜｜我竭了生命的力量呐喊着。</p>
<p>｜｜可不是？我已經跑到世界的盡頭了。眼前是一片荒凉與無數的墳墓，這不是人類最後歸宿之地嗎？</p>
<p>想想：我的神經瘋狂起來了。難道我就這麽踏上「滅亡之路」嗎？</p>
<p>｜｜不！不！｜｜我說：我還有希望，我還有力量，我還有生命，我不能死。</p>
<p>對於人生，我還没有付過滿足的代價絲毫的我還没有盡過自己的一點責任。我能這麽，就算終結了自己的生命嗎？</p>
<p>我每每想藉自己一點靑春的𤍠力，去燃燒人類的生命，去創造人生的意義，歌頌光明，這不是我對於人生的天職嗎？</p>
<p>然而我的努力使我發生灰心，懊怒，憤懣，我眞的已經感到絶望不成？</p>
<p>不錯，在偏見及惡劣的環境裹頭，不知道湮没了多少靑年有爲的生命呵。</p>
<p>我的足跡走遍了大地：荒涼的，破落的，充滿了無窮的慘象的。</p>
<p>到處是：</p>
<p>「停業」</p>
<p>「招頂」</p>
<p>「此路不通閒人莫進」</p>
<p>看着那些字眼，使我傷心，失望，憤激。</p>
<p>病了，我没有工作，没有生活，没有可以用我才能的所在。</p>
<p>想到這，我不覺又抖索起來。難道我祇有眼巴巴地看着自己滅亡不行？</p>
<p>｜｜不！不！我該應掙扎起來呵。｜｜自己回答着。</p>
<p>於是，我從新又鼓起勇氣，掙扎！呻吟過了一會後，我又躺了下來，悄悄地，悽悽地。</p>
<p>是的，我已經病得滿厲害了，没喫，没穿，没錢看醫生，買藥吃。讓惡魔把我的生命拿了去吧！</p>
<p>於是，一個死底恐怖的陰影，突然在我的眼前出現，在朦朧裹，我瞧見它底殘酷的面孔，伸長了它長長的血舌，一出一進地動着。它漸漸地挨近我的牀邊，睜開了它的　灼的眼睛，張大了它巨形的口，把它毛茸茸的手伸到我的頸項上來了。</p>
<p>｜｜㗒喲！｜｜，我高聲叫着｜｜我不死！我不能死！我不要死！我不願死！撲滅這魔鬼，驅逐這魔鬼。我要活，打倒死！</p>
<p>我的聲音充溢着恐怖，充溢着力量。一種生命的火燄，從新又在我的心裹復燃起來。於是我崛强地，一下子，就掙扎了起來。</p>
<p>心深是說不說的一種愉快的，於是我微微的笑着。這是一種勝利的微笑，多麽珍貴的微笑呵。我長遠没有笑了。悠久的沈湎在苦惱的生活裹，我不是已經喪失了一切對於人生的歡樂嗎？</p>
<p>此刻我康健地奮興地傲昂地站着，對於一切，我發出一種從來未有的𤍠望。</p>
<p>是的，我的年紀還輕哩，我有豐富的春靑的生命的力量，我有控制不住的𤍠情，我有血與暴力。靠着這血與力，我們不是會幹出轟天動地的奇績來嗎？</p>

<p>醫生回過眼來看他，好似要用眼睛吃掉他。</p>
<p>「先生，今兒是禮拜，」耐利辯解道，微笑，着亂。「我訂了婚！」</p>
<p>「噢，你訂了婚？」醫生狂悖地咆哮道。「那末抱了這個！」</p>
<p>口裹說着，他把病孩塞到耐利的懷裹去；於是他一一抓住了圍着他身的别的小家伙，憤怒地將他們對自己的腿撞着。</p>
<p>「還有這一個！還有這一個！還有這一個！還有這一個！畜生！畜生！」</p>
<p>他轉背向他，想要走開，但又轉過身來，取回了小病女，對兩個人呌道：</p>
<p>「去！把騾弄來！我立刻就走。」</p>
<p>耐利微笑轉身，在他哥哥之後走下石階去。他是二十歲年紀；未婚妻魯莎，十六歲：一朶玫瑰花！七個孩子！太少了！他要十二個。他會得祇用天賦一雙好手臂來養活他們，老是快活。做做工，唱唱歌，全用技能的力量來掘地唱歌。他叫做詩人利奧拉不爲無因。於是覺得自己被一切人都愛，愛他殷勤的温和，始終善良的天性，他竟對呼吸着的空氣也微笑起來。太陽還不曾把他的皮膚曬黑，也不曾把這麽許多女子所妒羨，一頭鬈髮的深金色曬枯；要如他悄悄用他那雙淸澈明亮的眼睛望一望女人，那就有這麽許多女人臉要紅，心要動。</p>
<p>他那天心中煩亂，倒並非因爲他的表兄柴魯的緣故，而是因爲他的魯莎曾經對他表示過嬌嗔，魯莎是七天以來一直巴望那個禮拜天好和他厮磨一會兒。可是他，良心上過得去不管這椿救急的好事嗎？可憐的柴魯！他是訂了婚的！多麽傷心的事，突然之間，就像這麽一個樣子！他是在下壩頭蒙脫魯沙，洛帕的產地上打杏仁。昨兒禮拜六早上，天看來像要下雨的樣子；但又好像不會馬上有落一陣陣頭雨的危險。</p>
<p>可是，向午時候，洛帕說道：「上帝趁時候做事，我的孩子們，我不願把我的杏仁，天雨依舊留在地上。」一邊他吩咐將杏仁拾了起來的女工送往堆儲房去剝殼。「你們」，他對打着的男工們說道（耐利和薩羅也在下）「你們要如高興，也不妨上那裹和女子們一同剝殼。「可以」，柴魯說道，「可是我也得全天一先令的工資」？「不能」，洛帕說道，「我將算你半工錢；其餘也半工錢，和女工們一樣」。其實這是欺人！爲什麽，也有叫男工停止工作不賺全天工資的道理？天又並不下雨，事實上，整個白天不下，那個晚上也不下。「像女工一樣半工資」？柴魯問道。我是個男子漢，你給我二十五便士一天的半工錢，我就走」。</p>
<p>他却並没有走：他留在那裹直到晚上，等他兩個表兄弟，他們是願意和女工一起剝殼，得半工的錢。然而一時倦於　　的站着瞧着，他走到附近的一個馬棚裹去，躺下身來睡了，叫人到回家的時候喚醒他。</p>

<h3 id="c240">從舉行國貨年所得之感想 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>購用國貨，爲國民之天職，努力國產，俾應所需，亦國民之本分，固無待於提倡，無需乎督促。乃吾國之情形大異於是，衣非「洋」不美，食非「洋」不足，居非「洋」不成，行非「洋「不速，日用所需，衣食所資，旣無一無「洋」；而本國所生產者無論其爲天然與人工，幾無可與之匹敵，以至農田荒蕪，機抒歇滅，手工業破產，即現在所稱爲「國貨」，實際即一「機器倣製洋貨」者，亦如風中殘燭，搖曳不定。此時人所以鑒於外來經濟侵略之無已，抵無可制之經騐，而努力於提倡國貨運動也。</p>
<p>然而一究提倡國貨之成績如何？自不能說無成效，但積二十年之功夫，所謂「國貨」也者，仍似未脫乳臭時期，不能與時代以並進，亦大可傷心矣。　觀一二八之翌年（二十二年），深　夫外患日逼，產業落伍，經濟潮流之壓迫，而有「國貨年」之號召，此一年中，市民所受大砲飛機之慘痛，尙未盡忘，故得一唱百和；其最顯而易見者，男子之土布大衫，婦女之格子布袍，居然風行於一時，土布店生意，亦得有一番起色。及至本年（二十四年）定爲「婦女國貨年」，婦女爲家庭選擇用品之主幹，日用商店常有以能否得到婦女之光顧信用，爲其業務盛衰之懸測，此其風氣在海外尤爲顯著，若上海市婦女自上店門購物之風漸盛，果能樂於購用國貨；則國貨之推行，如水之就下，將無往而弗届。孰意一年之時光易過，雖不能以百十餘萬之香水脂膏費，及格子布袍之消滅，土布營業之冷淡，爲婦女國貨年無成效之徵，但上海婦女之奢靡豪華，爭奇鬥妍，仍無改乎往態。</p>
<p>「國貨年」之提倡，係一種興奮劑，譬之心臟衰弱施以强心劑，求一時之維持，再圖根本之治療則可，若繼續行之，終歸於無效，蓋興奮劑之爲用，祇有刺激性，而無根本治療之力也。宣傳亦然，雖曰宣傅，但終須有事實爲之證，徒事宣傳，久之雖言者諄諄而聽者藐藐矣。即如一年一度之××國貨年，在主持之者用意甚佳，蓋惟如是而後可以收宏效，故用分年計程之法，若婦女，若學生，……擴而充之，則亦不妨若家長，若工人，若農人，……逐漸推行於各界。則國貨將不脛而自走矣。獨不念社會爲整個之社會，家庭如整個之家庭，分别舉行，在不知者將誤解爲此婦女國貨年也，與男子無涉；此學生國貨年也，與家長無關；容或無此事實，但亦不能使人不作此想。夫宣傳而使人多一回想，或多一例外，則其效力多少爲之减色，故雖有百般理論，不如一分事實。越王之十年生聚，十年敎養，卒以沼吳；衛文公之大布之衣，大帛之冠，終得復興爲其能力行也。居今日而言國貨，雖兒童亦知其必要，若問諸事實，則有以知其不然，圖畫之紙，繪畫之彩，以及西裝革履，家庭用品，……若兒童問諸敎師，詢諸父母，爲之敎師父母者將何辭以對，抑將分别言之，此爲文化品，此爲必需品，不得已而用之，抑竟爲之諱辨歟！如或不能，則已用洋貨，而勸人用國貨，此等自欺欺人之惡印象，遺留於心地純潔之兒童腦筋中，其影響又不知如何？己欲立而立人，己欲正而正人，己所不欲，弗施於人，奈何可躬自蹈之耶！</p>
<p>然愚亦非以國貨宣傳運動爲無需也，能提倡終勝於不提倡，能宣傳終勝於不宣傳，獨以二十年來提倡宣傳之力，仍未能收偉大之成效者，終覺於宣傳提倡之外，當另有努力之處。癓結所在，仍爲祇知勸人用國貨，而不能供給人以國貨，又不能使人樂用國貨而無怨，故此後應多從事實着想，少從理論用功夫；應從生產着想，少從消費作宣傳；應分其注重消費作之國貨年之精神，移而爲恊力促進生產以用求自給之工作。蓋有良好之生產，始得有良好之銷路；若無良好之生產，而勸人以必用，即無根深蒂固之經濟侵略如吾國者，亦易誘致洋貨之輸入。閱者切弗誤會以我爲洋貨作辯護，蓋事實如是，無論何人，選購貨物，必以「價廉物美」爲標準；即國貨廠商購進材料，亦何嘗不如是。出較小之價格，購較不經用之貨物，已爲購者所不願，何况……；雖購用國貨，有時不容算盡銖錙，應以整個利益爲重；但國貨廠商亦應從大衆使用者之利益着想，如以不經用之物而售給人用，在廠商固可藉愛國之名而脫貨求財，然使人以國貨之不經用或價格不相宜，轉而求諸洋貨，寗不同負促進洋貨銷路之責任乎？吾人嘗抵制日貨，至再至三，然每抵制一次，日貨進口量必增加一次，此不獨於中國爲然，即歐美南洋等處，日貨亦得源源侵入，觀夫時事新報（二三，十二，十八）所載日本大藏大臣高橋是淸訪問記中語，可以思過半矣。其言曰：</p>
<p>「各國雖抵制日貨，日貨仍源源輸出，而最近抵制聲亦漸息，因我日本（高橋自稱）商品價廉物美，爲世界各國冠，各國人民，寗有出重價購劣貨者乎？譬如中日商業，據最近外務省通商司消息，我國（日本）輸出品日增月盛，尤以人造絲爲甚，貴國（中國）雖有一部分反日者，從中作崇（？）然究以價廉之故，得行銷無阻，…」</p>
<p>此其言在高格出之，渺不足爲奇，而在我國人｜尤其是國貨廠商，能不同深汗顏。何以吾人抵制，徒托空言，羗無實際？又何以我國出品，不能「價廉物美」，得人樂用？「反而求諸已」，正爲多事宣傳，少求實際，粉飾塲面，浪博虛聲之故也。故舍大衆各盡所能，實事求是，埋頭苦幹之外，實無他途。</p>
<p>實際工作，就其小者以言之，近如上海綢緞業公會之禮服運動，亦不失爲一辦法；遠如京市府有六十元薪水以上之職員，應購置緞褂一件之傳說，以及湖社來年元旦團拜，一律藍袍黑褂之通吿，其事雖微，其效亦巨。有曰廣義以言之，何不曰絲織物。但時至今日，絲織物旣不爲摩登婦女所歡迎，又爲　眉男子所摒棄。余嘗謂婦女少穿幾雙高跟皮鞋，男子少做幾套西裝，若能盡改絲織品，裨益於絲繭綢緞業者已匪淺尠；至禮服運動，在舉世迷惑於呢絨洋貨之中，旣爲政府法規所明定，此而不能實行，其他尙何足！以云提倡國貨哉？</p>
<p>更就其大者以言之：</p>
<p>（二）如何能使人樂用國貨</p>
<p>此在國貨廠商本身之努力，即言之匪艱而行之維艱之「價廉物美」四字也。所謂價廉物美者，原係一比較之詞。價欲廉而物欲美，熊掌吾所欲，魚吾所欲，世上絶少兩全之事；但至少限度，總使人購有此物，不失爲「値得」，「値得」兩字即樂用之基礎也。吾人不必設醫取喻，但聞洋貨同是材料人工製造而成，外國之人工，旣比中國爲貴，又跋涉重洋裝運來華，加以水脚運費稅餉保險等等，何以尙能行銷無阻，何以本廠貨反爲其壓倒？固然國人「崇洋」之心理太卑劣，有以致之，而本廠貨不能從技術上求進步，失却主顧之信用，轉助洋貨之推銷，似亦不能辭其咎。</p>
<p>再則國貨之最大弊病，一種物品如得銷行，非高漲其價，即劣貨百出，或倣傚紛起，以致優劣莫辯，良莠難分，魚目混珠，買者掉首，而同歸於盡者已不少見。故廠商不從商德上，求人信，不從出品改良上求人用，而欲以宣傳之力，文字之功，愛國之名，法令相助使人用，此與發展國貨背道而馳，行之百年而無效；惟有良好之生產，乃有良好之銷路；有良好之銷路，洋貨不期然而自絶，國貨不期然而自興也。因此期望於國貨廠商者：</p>
<p>（甲）出品標凖化</p>
<p>（乙）成品精良化</p>
<p>（丙）售品廉宜化</p>
<p>（丁）同業恊力化</p>
<p>此四者成功之要訣也。皆不在宣傳，而在力行。</p>
<p>（二）如何能滿足人之需要</p>
<p>此指數量而言也。今日國貨廠商所有者能有洋貨幾分之幾，在未加分析之前，難得槪數，而可必其絶少。重工業絶無僅有，即應用工業亦祇絶少數出品，萬難與洋貨抗衡，以言其量，更不足道。若此而欲望人購用，人果購用矣，將何以應之，究其極非精製濫造，即改頭換面，以他人之出品，權充爲自己之所有，若此又無異爲冒牌國貨作推銷，與提倡之意旨大相反。故欲提倡某種出品也，必先檢查某種出品之内容及其生產量何如，若明知其不足敷用，或不知其内容如何，貿貿然以爲此可應用也，似猶孩提初學步，强之而行，非顚躓，即須人爲之扶掖也。故廠商望出品之爲人用，亦應念出品所能應大衆之需要者若干，假使能替代洋貨，人人樂購，力足以應此需求否，如或不能，將用何法以補充之。又應從洋貨所有國產。能如此分功計程，以求逐步實現，方爲目前之要着。</p>
<p>（三）如何能適應人之需要</p>
<p>嗜好不同，需求亦殊故如何能適應人之需要，爲國貨廠商所應悉亦當應爲也。外人貿易所以無往不利者，於俗尙之好惡，嗜好之變遷，息息均在其注意之中，乃能投人之所好，足人这慾望。即其自爲計亦然，如英人嗜茶，乃移植茶樹於錫蘭，意法喜絲織，則養育蠶桑，美人需桐油，則採取桐種，日人見蠶絲本重價高，慮將爲人造絲所打倒，則趕製人造絲，已能於自給之外，有大量輸出，與歐美產爭雄於市塲。其他各種工藝品無不然。我國如何？外人尙在求適應吾之需要，吾却不能以自應，優勝劣敗，形勢判然。故在一般認爲有此需要，吾當設法以求其適應，此其能否成功，有待各方面之恊作，但國貨廠商自爲其中之核心，奈何可不打起精神去做。</p>
<p>（四）如何能啓發人之需要</p>
<p>適應人之需要，似猶未足，應進一步，爲啓發人之需要。所謂啓發人之需要，亦猶俗語所謂「看看買買」，「看看」都本無「買買」之存心，「若果看得好，不妨買了去；」一方面固爲其有購買力，另一方面正爲此物品足以觸動其欲望，引起其需要。凡物如僅在適應目前爲已足，必至無進步，而歸於失敗，故能創造，能開發；有生產，有消費；如此演進，亦人羣之進化所繫。上海商店近亦多「歡迎參觀」之招貼，說雖如是，及跨進門去，往往留一種不快印象而出，何也？是在於處置之不當，轉爲其營業之累。</p>
<p>至國產工商業所以失敗者何在；就其本身以言之，亦可得下列數者：</p>
<p>（一）企業人才之缺乏</p>
<p>競爭劇烈之工商事業，欲以舊時之組織才具應什之，在彼不自量者不以爲不足，而在識者未嘗不引爲深憂。現在之經營工商業者，其目光，其識解，其精神，其作爲，應處處能適應現代潮流。而在我國多數不知組織爲何物，不知大勢爲何如，目光短淺，知識寡陋，因此祇可處順境，倖獲蠅頭之利，一遇逆境，則捉襟見肘，手足無措。本身旣不能安定，在人亦愛莫能助，於是困運之來，莫可挽救，甚或波及於其他，同遭池魚之殃者，尤不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>微聞有不少工商事業，皆爲舊時之組織不良，而改進爲難；結習太深而匡正匪易；機械陳腐而出品難精；雖有人才亦無能爲力，蓋非大施改革，不能望有進步；亟欲改革，則又阻碍橫生，困難交集。最好之一例，莫如××印書館，自遭大故改組之後，一切一切，皆非昔比，然其經理非前後兩人也；所以能如是，舊時之不良狀態，已隨砲火而俱去，不難從新澈底改造，以應時勢之需要，而有今日之結果。中國工商業之類似於此者正多，夫復何言！</p>
<p>（二）管理人才之缺乏</p>
<p>工廠出品之能精美價廉，與管理人才有深切之關係；管理不得其人，則材料有浪費，工時不經濟，出品不精良，而成本加重，銷路爲難。現在之工廠管理人員，往往不能兩全，即（一）有經騐無學識，（二）有學識無經騐。有經騐無學識者。大都自工人出身之工頭；有學識無經騐者，則爲學校出身之學生；夫有經騐而無學識，則不知改進，而墨守陳法：有學識而無經騐，則空談理論而缺乏實際；各應有以補救之，前者應設補習科授以新知，俾有改進；後者於其任用之始，必先於其所管理之工程，得有充分之實習後，方得實授；聞日本初亦有此弊，經此矯正後，而有今日之成績。</p>
<p>（三）技術人才之缺乏</p>
<p>技術人才，爲工廠出品之導師，推陳出新，製品精良，皆技術人才之責也。國人雖云改易舊觀念，然默察一般，舊時之思想結習，猶未盡化，故於技術人才之培植，每不如文法經濟之衆多；即有些須技術人才，往往「英雄無用武之地，」而棄其所學，他方面需要人才而無處以求，人才之埋没於不能調節者半，失於訓練者亦半。時人嘗謂非科學不能救國，此後應有尊重科學家之精神，培養技術人才，以解决工商業當前之困難。</p>
<p>（四）工人技能之缺乏</p>
<p>工廠製品之成功，雖在技師管理員指導之下，而成於工人之手；故工人技能之優劣，與製品之好惡，大有關係。吾國工人以敎育之不普及，往往目不識丁，即其工作，亦但知其然，而不知其所以然，故難得有進步。再則工人近來對於其生活待遇，時時求其改善增高；而於其所操之工作效能，則未見其努力求進取；甚至工作反見退步，效能反爲减少，而有成本加重，出品退化之弊害百出。故工人之紀律，工人之服務，工人之技能，如何改善之，與中國工商業關係至鉅。</p>
<p>此外如資本缺乏，而週轉欠靈，不易發展。尤其求近利之心太迫切，以是無遠圖，難作持久之戰，易爲人制。有以爲金融界不投資於工商業相　備，吾非金融業中人，無所左右袒，但金融界之投資，其惟一條件爲安全，即有索還其本息之可能。今工商業本身是否健全，不敢作槪括之論句，但如組織精密，確爲財力不濟而前途有望者，金融界若不爲之接濟，則是居心不可問矣。</p>
<p>吾國工商業除其内在的缺陷外，尙有外來的侵犯，茲就其與國貨工廠所關較密切者言之，以節篇幅：</p>
<p>（一）材料問題</p>
<p>現在所謂國貨，質言之，可謂爲洋貨之加工製造品，因其所用之材料，大都爲洋貨，故仍難與洋貨爭一日之長。洋商知某種材料爲其某種之競爭品也，則不妨於其訂購材料之時，故抬其價，使其出品。仍難與洋貨爭，此其一。再則能以保育工商業而抵抗外來者，利用關稅壁壘以攔阻之，但爲材料不能自給之國家，如提高關稅，即無異加重本國出品之成本。三則一切材料用品都仰給於舶來，又無異將我工業生死之權，操諸洋商手中，永不能脫其覊絆，而無將其肅淸之日。故我全國上下應恊力促進下列各事之成功：</p>
<p>（一）材料自給，應分期分業，從各方面以圖其實現，而達到自產自給並以給人之最後目的；</p>
<p>（二）就重要之工業品，其材料非外來不可者，應酌减其進口稅至某程度爲止；</p>
<p>（三）產加重食用所不必要（如海味蔬頭食品……等等）及本國工商業已有出品勉可應付之同種類洋貨進口稅，阻其傾銷；</p>
<p>（四）應竭力改良農產，興修水利，開發礦產，以期材料之充實；</p>
<p>以上就材料之自給而並及於關稅問題也。</p>
<p>（二）設廠問題</p>
<p>自中日馬關條約鑄成大錯，許洋商在通商口岸亦得設廠，並與華商同等待遇，原本不足奇；但在我工商業知識技能幼稚之國家，所可賴以與洋商相　撑者，祇有地域上之便利與廉賃之勞力耳，今一旦與洋商共之，我財力不如人，技術不如人，管理不如人，何可與之相處於一隅，華日紗廠之優劣，已可以槪見。自關稅提高之後，洋商就地設廠製造之心理更堅，所以表現於事實者正不知有多少；若任其邁進不已，流毒所屆，摧殘所及，較之進口洋貨爲尤甚，華商工廠勢必至於一劫不復，莫可挽救，所謂「附骨之疽」是也。談廢約則約之已滿期應作廢而不廢者，不知有多少，故可不必談。所望於當局者，祇有增加出廠稅籌給華商工廠之奬勵金而已，若祇有加稅，而不給華商以奬勵金，則亦自毁其工商業而已矣，尙何言哉！</p>
<h3 id="c241">民國二十三年中國煤鑛業的回顧 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 朱文淸</p>
<p>中國煤礦的藏量，據翁文灝先生在一九三二年的估計，爲二四·○八一百萬噸；中間山西所佔的成份爲最大，計一二七·一二七百萬噸，超過總藏量的百分之五十以上，而已被暴日强佔的東北四省，也有四·六一○百萬噸。这裹我們必須注意一件事實，那就是中國藏煤的區域，並不曾充分開發；而東北四省等在列强資本勢力控制之下的地方，其開發的程度却計，列强在華煤礦方面的投資，比起華資來要大過三倍。藏煤最富的山西，在一九三二年只產煤七十六萬噸，而東北四省却年產八百多萬噸，河北年產六百多萬噸，河南年產一百六十萬噸，山東年產一百五十多萬噸。東北四省的煤業，目下已經整個成爲軍需工業的策源地，撫順煤礦已是中國甚至英國在華煤礦投資的最大的威脅。河北省所產煤礦六百六十萬到七百萬噸，中間有百分之九十以上是英國資本的產品，只開　一家，已年產六百萬噸左右。就是，有些華資煤炭公司，一部份也已經抵押給日本，河南省產煤年約一百六十萬噸。在這裹英國資本主辦的福公司佔着支配的地位；同時中原公司現在雖派員整理，裁减工人，可是也早已入於福公司的掌握之中。六河溝的煤礦，也是豫省著名的產礦之區，目下也已歸中日實業公司接辦，換句話說，也早已落在日本資本手裹。</p>
<p>民族資本比較叫得響的比較上還算山東一省。山東於一九三二年的產量是一百五十七萬噸，中間除日資經營的魯大產煤五十四萬噸外，其餘都屬華資企業的產量。至於其他各地的煤礦如萍鄕煤礦完全在日資統治之下，無從發展。山西煤礦　量雖富，但此僅能激起列强的垂涎百尺，却並未能有助於民族企業之　　。山西省的統制經濟政策非但没有使本省產業逐漸發展，反因運費和捐稅之苛重，使大好富源，終究「貨棄於地」，不能發展。一九三四年一月十八日天津大公報有下述記載：「全國煤運費率，以正太路爲最高，而該路所定運費，對於各礦亦甚懸殊。……鐵路運煤每噸英里七厘運費，爲萬國運價之標準。北寗之於北票煤，湘鄂之於漢治煤膠濟之於魯大礦，雖未能盡合七厘之運率，然亦不甚懸殊。但正太路對於晋煤，每噸每公里以○·○二四元收價，若按英里推算，則爲○·○四七元，實較萬國率增至五六倍之多，即較中國各路運率，亦增高四五倍。」這裹我們須要指明，上引與萬國運率相差不甚懸殊的各條鐵路，它們所運的北票煤，魯大煤，和漢治煤等等，都是屬於外資方面；換句話說，外資經營的煤炭能够享受較廉的運價，而純粹的國煤，却無福享受這種優惠；於是也可見得中國所有的鐵路，對於外貨和國貨的歧視了。</p>
<p>以上所說是中國煤礦業的一般狀况。現在我們要追溯一年以來的槪况。中國的國民經濟在世界經濟恐慌日趨深刻，外資對華活動日益加緊的條件之下，正在走着整個破產的死路。中國自辦的煤炭業自然不能例外，目下煤炭的消費數量正因爲一般國民購買力的薄弱和一般工廠的停工减工，正在一天一天减縮。因此煤炭的價格也在很快地跌落。我們舉開平所產煤炭爲例。</p>
<p>開平煤每噸價格升降表（單位元）</p>
<p>二號塊　　一號粉　　二號粉</p>
<p>一九三三年</p>
<p>十二月　一○·八　一○·九　九·一</p>
<p>一九三四年</p>
<p>一月　一○·一　一○·一　九·一</p>
<p>六月　一○·一　　九·六　八·六</p>
<p>一九三四年十月到十二月間在名義上煤炭的價格雖有些增加，實際價格却在六月份的低價以下，年底時份煤商因爲手頭拮據，不得不跌價抛賣，換取現錢，所已煤價更有直跌之勢。</p>
<p>現在我們要看煤炭輸入上海方面數量，我們對於十一月和十二月兩月的輸入數量還没有確切的數字，只得假定該兩月的輸入數量和一九三三年同期相仿（實際上顯見减少）。其數字應如下表；</p>
<p>一九三一年　三、六一七、○○○噸</p>
<p>一九三二年　二、九四二、二七六</p>
<p>一九三三年　三、三二九、三五八</p>
<p>一九三四年　三、一九二、七六七</p>
<p>一九三四年和上年相比約减少了十四萬噸。這裹我們還要指明，一九三四年輸入的煤炭，其品質確乎一般比上年爲差，其原因爲中國自產煤炭的輸入稍有增加（這種現象眞是又可氣，又可喜呢）！的緣故。今舉中國煤和日本煤在輸入方面的消長如下；</p>
<p>一九三四年一　　　　　一九三三年一月</p>
<p>月至五月　　　　　　　至五月</p>
<p>中國煤一、○五七、九六五噸　八九六、一六七噸</p>
<p>日本煤　　一八九、三四三　　五三一、九三三</p>
<p>據上表，中國煤的輸入有相當的增加，而日本煤却减少了三分之二。據煤炭公會發表的數字，一月至十一月國煤進口稅，一九三三年同期增加二十五萬噸，日煤則大爲减少。</p>
<p>不過上述的現象决不足以表示中國煤炭的優勢，反之，它是中國益發趨於殖民地化的表現。何以言之？因爲，日本煤輸入的减少，並不是因爲中國煤炭的產量增加，或是質量有所改進或是因爲日本產煤的衰落；原因却在；日本近一二年來軍需工業的突飛猛進，它們需要多量的煤鐵原料，特别從一九三三年初日本設立了昭和石炭會社，它和日本的工業聯合會合作，進行煤炭的統制販賣。就是東北的撫順煤礦（當然已在日人掌握之中），也因爲供給日本和本地工業的需要，其輸入的數量已有顯著减少。</p>
<p>一九三年四年　　　　　　一九三三年一月</p>
<p>六月至十月　　　　　　　至十月</p>
<p>中國煤一、一○六七、七○○噸　八六二、六○四噸</p>
<p>撫順煤　　一六九、四四二　　　二六六、九五四</p>
<p>中國煤炭如大通，淮南，開平，中興，等公司的煤炭，確和日煤掀起劇烈的競爭，因此煤價狂跌，日本國和東北的煤炭確乎已難和華煤對抗。不過，我們必須注意，此際所謂華煤，並不是純粹華資經營的企業的產品，許多煤炭還是英資系統下的產物，甚至有一部份，還是和日資共同管理之下的企業的產品呢！</p>
<p>一九三四年一月至十月各處煤炭輸入數量（單位千噸）</p>
<p>煤礦名稱　數量　　煤礦名稱　數量</p>
<p>中興　　　三五○　開平　　　九三○</p>
<p>山東　　　四四○　大通　　　　三○</p>
<p>華東　　　　七○　淮南　　　　六五</p>
<p>合計　二、一四○</p>
<p>開平煤炭的輸入額，竟差不多佔到輸入總額的半數。可是一般而言，從九一八以後國人排斥日貨之勢方盛，所以就上海輸入煤炭來看，中國的煤炭確乎稍有增加；如從靑島輸入的山東煤，從秦皇島輸入的柳江煤，從天津輸入的山西煤等都有增加。一九三四年一月到十月，這些名義上稱爲中國煤的輸入額，已達二百十四萬噸之多。一九三三年同期這些煤炭的輸入量，只有一百七十五萬噸。</p>
<p>現在再來看看其他外國煤炭的進口情形。以前從法領安南的鴻基和海防地方運來的鴻基和海防無烟煤，全年總要到三十萬噸之多。從一九三三年五月中國實行新關稅增加輸入稅後，這些無烟煤就大爲减少，一九三四年七月一日起實行的新關稅又將無烟煤進口稅增徵到每噸六元左右，這樣才使外國炭的輸入受到重大的打擊。例如一九三三年從六月到十月，它們的進口量是三萬五千六百三十二噸，而到一九三四年的同期，突降到一萬八千九百二十噸。</p>
<p>總結起來看，一九三四年外煤的輸入雖有减少，可是這種情形只能表示日本和别的國家因爲發展其軍用工業和一般重工業，所以對於煤的需要激增。一般而論，這種塲合，應爲中國的民族煤業發展的有利條件。不過，就目前事實來講，中國這個最主要的礦業，（注意，就目下技術程度而言，礦業是發展整個國民經濟，特别是工業部門的基本條件），多半是在外資手裹，年來開灤煤礦幾乎成爲英日資本角逐的塲所，英國雖然掌握該礦權利，可是日本人要起擴充其撫順煤銷路，更進而要想囊括整個華北的富源計，所以正在千方百計地予以破壞。其次我們看到日人最近在山東魯大和漢治萍公司方面的積極活動，眞使我們不寒而慄。它們還時常派遣考察隊，到山西綏遠等地考察，此種行動，除帶有軍事意義而外，其於華北富源的奪取，至少是一種有力的動機。反看我國情形，則中原六河溝諸礦雖有整理之舉，可是大權，已落外人之手，成績又並不見佳，其他各　也停工减工，無不　　常進行。長此以往，中國的煤業勢非盡入外人之手不止。一九三四年上海輸入煤炭額的增减，也只能變相地表現外煤勢力之擴張而已。</p>

<p>— 戈白</p>
<p>日歷已翻到最後的一頁了。從懷着一團希望親自掛到新糊了花紙的牆壁上，而一頁一頁地撕下來到今天爲止，覺得日子眞是過得太快了。但是那團希望呢，彷彿依舊停留在那個時候，想起來却反是太悠久了。</p>
<p>新送來的日歷又端正展着笑容在案頭歡迎我：恭賀新禧！是的，在二十四小時之後，又是一個新的開始了。翻開自己空白的日記簿，還能把這没有實現的希望再預約嗎？而且誰知道在這組新日歷翻到最後一頁的時候是怎末的光景？</p>
<p>人類好像是永遠欺騙着自己的，以前種種昨日死，以後種種今日生，把希望放在永遠追不過頭的前面，而把生命像日歷一樣翻到最後一頁爲止，甚至留着下一代再向這希望的燈追去，一如舊的日歷被新的替代了，又從頭一頁一頁的撕過去。</p>
<p>把自己的生命付託在希望的後面，已記不淸從我手中翻完了幾組日歷了。每一年的今天，把那薄薄一頁的日歷毫不顧惜地撕了，再喜冲冲的把新的掛上，似乎自己預約的希望已是漸漸的接近，而不知道已浪費了幾多自己的生命！</p>
<p>望着那灰黯的牆壁，這最後的一頁在俄頃之間就要變成陳迹了，這筆「總賬」的責任，露着恭賀新禧笑臉的新日歷能否勝任愉快，恐怕明年翻到最後一頁的時候，還是個没有答覆的懸案呢！</p>
<h3 id="c246">日歷翻身的時候 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 櫻櫻</p>
<p>四先生坐在搭高的破賬桌前，邊搓着吹不着的抺頭紙，邊翻着賬桌上安放的案頭日曆！他最初意思好像是欲翻數一下究竟可還剩得幾張日曆？但是在剛把手指接觸了一下，塗亮的克羅米案架，眞像個棉花絲做織的，一下子頭重脚輕，一個觔斗直往前撲了過去。他望着案架下的撑脚發呆了半天！</p>
<p>他很淸楚記得完全不錯的。這個日曆是在上海某大書局當櫃員的他的兒子，特地在去年底托信客帶年物來一併帶來的。自然這也是出了許多錢買來的。休說在鄕間是罕見的；卽使在上海也除非是大商店大公司才用得起這樣精緻考究的克羅米架的案頭日曆，兒子的信裹是數次三番提明白的。</p>
<p>四先生當時收到這個他生平所不曾見過一眼的精緻日曆，他曾因快活得太過份而跌碎了一塊幾十年相伴爲命的老光眼鏡上的玻璃片。</p>
<p>但是他並不懊悔，失去了數十年的古董眼鏡片，換來的却是最新式的炫人眼光的白銅日曆。</p>
<p>他每天必定在起身後，親自去翻轉一下日曆日子，像做了件得意事樣，高興得什麽似的似的！</p>
<p>但是近日來端眞臉龐漸轉漸難看哩。翻日曆固然完全没先前高興的神氣，好象完全這是一件他最不耐煩做的工作；然而假使有别人因他偶然忘掉翻而代他翻了過去昨天的日子，他因之而會大發雷霆之怒了！</p>
<p>四先生有着重大的心事是不錯的。</p>
<p>他每天從早上起身漱洗後，習慣似的呼了一回水烟筒，接着許多愁思在他額角上打了百結！</p>
<p>每天要這麽許多人吃飯，但是每天没有人上門來買一樣東西，眼看維福坐在櫃檯邊祇顧打盹，阿春根老像憨大樣痴望着外面看野景。其實端眞呌他們做什麽事呢？有時候眞狠不過，阿春根吃了飯亦是擂頭一個打盹，硬拖了起來也呌再掃一片地。</p>
<p>櫃檯空擱裹堆滿了大𤍠天就没有賣出的十六把大蒲扇三十把油紙扇。這些東西除了抽大烟的，永遠不會有人來請敎的了。</p>
<p>他亦曾有一時間如意的想到過，或許等明年𤍠天他會發一筆大大利市，那麽他可以把價格提上了，一樣還是能賺錢的。</p>
<p>錢敬記房主來催討了六次房租，昨天臨走的時候，着實對他白了一陣眼睛。</p>
<p>假使下次來時，再不給我償淸，老實我要封大門喇！</p>
<p>他爲了這句話，眞把心子顫抖了半天！</p>
<p>今天起來時，手心還那末顫得利害，結果輕輕地翻了一下日曆，無緣故的會向前倒了過去。</p>
<p>他是永遠不會象日曆一樣有翻身的時候了！</p>

<p>— 倩紅</p>
<p>天幕低低的罩着，灰色的雲塊像鉛般沉重的凝固着，雪花却隨着北風在空中飛舞。今天雖然是耶蘇聖誔，有錢人在過着華年佳節的日子，他却不能不冐着雪流浪街頭爲着待哺的妻兒而行丐，他來回奔走地在雪中伸出手來向那些從戲院，菜館出來的高貴的人們懇求「做做好事吧」！但，每一次所得到的都是失望，一直到他踏進這破舊的家門的時候，他所帶回來的却祗有凍與餓吧了！他踉蹌地走進來，站在門檻那裹搖動着身體，灑去衣服上的雪花，妻一見了他，便急切的問：「討到些什麽没有」？「没有，連一個銅板也没有！唉！什麽也没有！」他頽喪，無力地回答下這麽一句，便逕自走去坐在床沿上。妻跟着過來，想從悲苦中給他一番安慰。可是，當她的手按在他的肩上的時候，不容這樣的呌了起來：「哎唷！你身上全都透濕了」？「透濕？刚纔地那麽大，正是戲院散塲的時候，我在跑馬廳那裹站了一個多鐘頭，我想替人家呌車或者可以得到幾個銅板。結果呢？祇是站在雪泥裹餓着肚皮，看人家擁擁擠擠的走出來，歡天喜地的攅進汽車，馬車裹面去，雪是落的那麽大，我站在那裹要躱避馬頭，又要躱避汽車，淋得我渾身濕透，所得到的就祇有「滾開，呌化子！滾開，滾開！」的叱駡……」他剛說到這裹，妻已一面在淌眼淚，一面帶着悽感地對着他：「你并没有做過什麽壞事，該討人家這樣没趣……」這一句話使得他像一隻被傷了要害的野獸似的號呌起來：「該討没趣！我做過甚麽壞事，公司倒閉</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，我找不着别的事做，我失業了，這也是我的過錯？他媽的！那些人出口不是把你敎訓一番，便是駡人」！「可不是嗎，早上我帶小寳寳一路出想辦法的時候，街上那些太太們都說：「這樣的落雪天，不應該帶小孩子出門呢！」這一句把他提醒了，當他出去的時候，那無邪的小孩子還在那啼着要東西吃呢。他轉過頭來，看見小孩子倒是睡熟了。於是他心裹想，這小孩子大槪是吃飽了吧？他一想到這裹，就像完了做父親養育兒子的責任似的感到快慰！他忘記了今天所遭遇的痛苦，他忘記了這時身上的寒冷，和肚子裹的餓：然而，他終於對妻提起了：「小孩子該是吃飽了吧？你呢」？正在凝思着什麽似的妻，給他這麽一問，眞是有點兒莫明其妙，他疑惑地回了一句：「什麽？吃飽，那來的東西？唉！我們大人挨餓還不裹緊，這小孩子才可憐哩！從餓哭到疲了！……」妻在抽咽着了。這時，被纒在一床破棉絮裹頭的小孩子也醒了，呌着肚子餓，要東西吃啦！呌得他也感到肚子着實是餓得很了｜他痛苦地望着妻在哄小孩子，說是「天還没亮呢，好寳寳！再睡罷，不要哭，昨天爸爸帶臘腸麵皮回家來啊！」使他想起了從前過的好日子，又想到了失業以後的悲慘的生活：他雖然有過想自殺的念頭，然而，這念頭終於被他的自尊之心打成粉碎。一直到今天，他還是帶着妻兒在死綫上掙扎着呢。他發狂似的呌了起來：「不，我要活下去！我要活下去｜我要帶錢和吃的東西回來｜「他突然地離開床沿不顧妻的呌喚，便又衝出門去了，這時，天　還是低低地罩着，灰色的雲塊像鉛般沉重的凝固着，雪花依然在空中飛舞着。</p>
<h3 id="c248">新年舊話 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>如若不是因街頭巷落中點綴着各樣花綵各樣景緻，才使我亦難堪地意識到又逢着一個新的年頭的降臨，不然這個日子便將會從毫無感覺的當中而悄悄過去的，如今我不得不扮着一面笑臉，也如人之嘻嘻向誰說着，向着人那麽說：恭賀新禧。在這粗俗的聲息里，在這笑嘻嘻的臉色里，明明是包藏着人們無限的喜悅，和閃耀着無限的希望的光。可是祇有我是無可奈何地掩住陰黯的臉色而裝得好像如同人們一樣歡幸般的歡幸着，事實上人間所有的愉樂早就與我没緣的新年在别人的眉梢都塗着稀有的欣懌的影子，而這些我却全讓與嘆息和眼淚所佔去了。</p>
<p>用着一顆充滿凄凉的心渡着所謂新年。</p>
<p>在外邊流浪了好些日子，我的心情和思想漸斬地被紛紜的世事磨蝕到幾乎失掉作用了。記得在年輕時，一聽碰到新年又來了，簡直會歡快到整天儘跳綳綳，夜里睡不着兒，儘盼待着日子的快來，新年的確是無我的孩子們最幸福的天地，有得玩，有得好東西吃，想那樣便那樣，大人們是無不聽從的，就是閙到天翻地覆，也没人來管。大人們在這種時候是特别依附小孩子的要求的。</p>
<p>而臨到除夕的前夜就眞是跟着一家子的人圍爐守夜，這些事是古遠了，想起來只有引起一種說不出的悵惘，其實也用不着追回到那麽遼遠的事。就是當在未離開故鄕的數年前，　逢此　，只消早上朝外溜溜，看着各家門口都貼上新鮮的紅色的門聯，另後再聽聽隨處在剝拍的爆竹的聲音。</p>
<p>雖則自己已是站在燃放爆竹的孩子羣圈外的人，但是置身於這樣的境地里，不知不覺地一種近似童年的情景亦會自然地打心邊汹湧着。</p>
<p>現在卽連這個心境上的幻想也完了</p>
<p>數年間在生的長途上顚沛流連，感於人事的蒼凉，生之飄忽，尤其是感於自己生命的渺小，擠在這如波浪似的人海里，兇猛的浪花不斷地滾上來，自己隨時隨地都知道有被捲進浪花里頭，湮没下去的可能。就使不然而實生活的重壓的石塊亦足以呌我倒了下來。生的荷負一年一年的加重，已經加重到一隻螞蟻的我似的所能背我的力量以上了。</p>
<p>年歲的增長，同時就越是生的担子的沉重，這樣下去，無異是一天天的接近墳墓的邊沿的。</p>
<p>新年來了，我的脚子又被背膊上突然添重的担子壓得軟下來，而且眼發花</p>
<h3 id="c249">月當頭夜 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 蕙人</p>
<p>因爲時常聽人吟着那一句：「人生幾見月當頭！」的詩時，便引起了我今夜待等着的决心。</p>
<p>平時，獨自個兒在月下彳亍的時候，老是見着自己底影子射在身前或身後，看上去怪孤零；因爲這樣，便獨自個兒的悲哀起來，不是想着家便悲嘆着自己的命運。除掉了是一個詩人或已有伴侶之外，大都對於月夜會引起一點點Sentimental來的吧！因爲牠怪陰森的没有給人一點暖和的意思。往常有人用銀灰色的……句調來形容或象徵自己環境，這一點也略可證明人們對於月夜景像的反影了。</p>
<p>至於月當頭夜很近新年的來到，這似乎給人一種刺激，呌人再不要讓自己𤍠衷下去，　應當在另一個新的年份開始他的新生活1牠把你的影子藏去，就是等於呌你忘去過去。</p>
<p>今天吃完了晚餐，就凖備着怎樣的來消受，至於烟啊，咖啡茶等早已在計畫中了。望着時鐘一分一分的過去，看着月亮一點點的東移，便像有一件喜事降臨來的一樣快樂。</p>
<p>今夜霜很重，風也括得很緊，看看天上的雲，却也密得很重；月亮不住的被雲呑下去吐出來，這樣很使我擔心，會不會在午夜看不見月光？化了的時間還是小事，事後的失望倒有點那個。</p>
<p>時間一刻刻的下沉，環境一點點的沉寂起來，街上的步調聲淸悉的可數，這樣以爲是將不會再有人在街上活動的了，但很奇怪，差不多每半小時便有一隊皮鞋脚聲沉重地從街上傳入，嘴裹還高聲的唱着歌。後來知道是日兵的夜巡隊。</p>
<p>這似乎是一個很大的刺激，牠破壞了我今夜的賞月，牠毁滅了我心間的快樂！因爲牠給我不得不帶來些意識問題，差不多像刺一樣觸着我的心，又其是他們皮鞋聲近園時。</p>
<p>最後，我知道悲哀不是單純的，個人的，而是複雜的，大家的；就是月當頭照不到自己的尾巴，顯出了自己的悲哀，但是同樣地有别的會來到的。</p>
<p>結果午夜一點也没有月光，倒是馬路上的電燈光照出我的影子怪長地拖在地上。</p>

<p>— 素華</p>
<p>凡所受的刺激愈深刻，則留存在腦海裹的印象能長久。這是很普通的一種記憶定律。現在我們還記得嗎？那位天眞活潑的「甜姐兒」｜｜耐賽卡洛。她給我們的印象多麽的深刻！數年前，她主演的「靑春俱樂部」“Follow　Thru”時間雖然是很長久了，但是恐怕我們大多數的人還未能忘記吧。近年來，她好像和我們有些疏遠了，不見到她的片子。蘋菓般的臉兒，和那兩個迷人的笑渦，已經望穿了不少人們的秋水。這就是因爲她數年來已經離開了好萊塢，離開攝影塲的煩雜，避開刺目的水銀燈，到歐洲去享受些稍爲淸閒的生活。在她未離開好萊塢之前，她却和現在大名鼎鼎的琪尼蕾孟合演了一張片子。那時的琪尼蕾孟祇是初上銀壇的新演員，而那張和耐賽卡洛合演的片子，也就是他頭一次在銀幕上的出現。雖然那一張片子不是在好萊塢攝製，但是他那時的表演已給了好萊塢的製片公司認識了。就立刻的把他請到了影城來。數年來，他不絶地努力，加着天賦的才能；他的藝術蒸蒸日上，現在已成爲主演小生角色的重要人物了。你看他在「錦繡天」裹的成功，不是鐵一般的證實嗎？琪尼蕾孟本來就有表演的天才，他五歲的時候已經扮演過兒童角色，後來他竟離開了他本來的學校，到戲劇學校去求深造。畢業出來，他就過他舞台的生活。在人才集聚的紐約百老匯舞臺上，他演劇的天才和他的少年英俊，已經給了人們不少的認識和特别的注意。主演「蝴蝶夫人」的女主角薛爾維亞雪妮在舞臺上已經和他合作過而得到成功。現在兩人都高據着好萊塢的明星寳座。</p>
<p>琪尼蕾孟除了是一位天才演員以外，他還是一位全能的運動健將。他會騎馬，游泳，打拳，擊劍，還會打得很好的網球和高爾夫。他的一手好鋼琴，我們不是已經在「錦繡天」裹面欣賞過了嗎？</p>
<p>當然他現在好萊塢受盡世人的讚美，是應該萬分的感激耐賽卡洛和他第一次合作的。當耐賽卡洛回到好萊塢，替福斯公司拍完了「春色惱人」之後，雷電華公司就用重金聘了她過來，給她主演籌備年多的百萬金巨片「海上行宫」。這一張巨片，得到了「甜姐兒」來主演，女主角的一方面當然不會困難。祇是男主角的人選，就不得不呌雷電華公司的當局爲難了。固然他們都知道琪尼蕾孟是這張片子最適當的人材，可惜琪尼蕾孟是一位鼎鼎大名，紅極一時而不受合同縛束的明星，各家都爭着聘請他，恐怕他分身不下。後來公司裹面覺得除非耐賽卡洛去和他相量，是難以成功的，當然耐賽卡洛是他的成功的幫助者，他斷不會拒絶的。所以她一來，他就立刻推却别家公司的合同答應她了。現在本埠快要公映的「海上行宮」，在雷電華公司費盡了人事，心血，金錢之後卒於完成了。琪尼蕾孟的一種感恩知己的精神，當然可敬；而我們的「甜姐兒」能無有動於中乎？（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c256">評「風流寡婦」 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>The　Merry　Widow</p>
<p>｜南京｜</p>
<p>記得有聲影片剛剛趨於成熟的時候，希佛萊和麥唐納主演的「璇宮艶史」，曾經在上海哄動一時。關於那一部影片，不僅是大規模的音樂片，而且是五彩的，這使觀衆們感覺極大的滿足。同時希佛萊和麥唐納的聲名，也就老幼皆知，而「璇宮艶史」的歌曲，也就家傳户曉。那種盛况，乃是人們不會忘懷的了。</p>
<p>僅由於這一點，便可决定「風流寡婦」賣座之盛。它同樣是「璇宮艶史」的主角主演，希佛萊和麥唐納的觀衆，自然不會輕輕的放過這一欣賞的機會。至於默片的「風流寡婦」，其給與觀衆們之影響，自然也是很大的。</p>
<p>此外，我們不妨更進一步的來探討這一影片賣座的原因。很顯然的，這裹由於故事的幻想，給與人們綺麗的美夢。那樣瀟洒風流的伯爵，那樣娟好多情的豪富的寡婦，他們在那般富麗奢華的環境中，花好月圓，終成好夢，如此故事的構成，其和中國的才子佳人故事之使人們觀迎。是不會兩樣的。特别是在目前，殘酷的現實，給人們非常不愉快的情形之中，這一影片是更足以給與高貴的人們一種美妙的安慰，雖然這種安慰是很空虛的。至於有一部份觀衆，對於導演劉别謙（Ernst　Lubitsch）的名字，也很熟悉，這未嘗不是賣座的原因之一。</p>
<p>現在，我們且從劉别謙的作風來檢討一下。從「璇宮艶史」到「風流寡婦」，他的作風是没有變革的。他的故事，離開現實固然很遠，而就在完全幻想的劇情中，他所需要的是偉大的塲面，奢侈的道具，華麗的服裝。於是男才女貌，在悲歡離合的劇情中，在曼妙的歌聲中，在翩遷的舞隊中，他把握着妖媚的風光，治蕩的情調，柔温的情意，都是所謂明快柔和的作風。總而言之，他應當是典型的資本主義的電影藝術家，而這「風流寡婦」之類，自然是資本主義電影特出的作品了。</p>
<p>就電影藝術舊型的表現方法來說，在「風流寡婦」中，人們是找不出所謂疵點的。一切都顯得滑膩與燦爛，這無論是温柔的對白，醉人的音樂，佻㒓的動作，在適當的織接與Tempo之下，無一不是資本主義登峯造極的表現。自然這裹得提出編劇Enrest　Vajda和SarnsonRaphaelsono對於劇的節奏處置得非常熨貼，以及Franz　Lehar的作曲，都帮助了　一影片而獲得成功。至於珍妮麥唐納的演技，　　　　　　　　吻她的手的時候，她那般細膩地在無言中表現出她内心的情與慾，僅就這一點，便可證明她的老練。他如希佛萊和那飾大使的，都是演得極好的。</p>
<h3 id="c257">評「紉珠」 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>｜卡爾登映｜</p>
<p>包天笑的「空谷蘭」小說，在當時頗爲大多數的讀者所稱道的，明星公司攝成影片後，由於張織雲演技的相當成功，更是比較廣大地號召了當時的不少觀衆。</p>
<p>「空谷蘭」小說的所以能够「轟動一時」，並不是事出偶然，乃是因爲它用着當時一些新興的事實，如火車，照相，藥水，辦學校女敎員，愛國戰爭，婚姻自由等，來相當成功地表現了在當時社會中一般新的悲喜劇，倫理地感情地發掘了一下愛與妒這些人性的舊糾紛。在當時，這種比較新的創作態度與方法，的確是比較爲當時一般新興階級所接受與歡迎的。</p>
<p>以全部對白有聲片在這一九三四年之末纔上塲的「　珠」，我們是該因着牠新的恣態，而給以新的評價的。可是有點叫我們遺憾的，這新的「　珠」，比之「空谷蘭」，除了把對話來代替了一部分字幕之外，似乎没有給予觀衆更多與更好的什麽。並不是我太苛求的話，有些在默片中較深沉，較感人的地方，在這兒倒不見得有如前的效果了。</p>
<p>由全片看來，作者似乎手法比較軟弱了一點兒，有些被故事所拘束，只是儘在用畫面來說明，没有充實與深刻地來作爲必要的描冩。換句話說，過塲戲做得還好，作爲這劇本的中心與頂點的許多地方，也平平地隨着過去。一個基於倫理，應有充分的感情發揮的戲，由於畫面的處理空氣把握得不够適當，失去了牠應得的效果了。有些鏡頭，簡直是浪費，未能應用對白來省去不必要的塲面。比如畫面上蘭蓀騎着馬走了很多的路了，　珠跑來對父親說「哥哥來了」，再現着蘭蓀騎馬的一段才相遇。　珠對蘭蓀說，「我去吿訴我爸爸」，指「那是我爸爸」，再映一長段膠片，相見了，而蘭蓀又重問「尊性」等。在結婚宴時，畫面上已經放映出許多席面了，蘭蓀才來請客人出去，再重複一段映過的席面。小孩病後，旣然用電話請出蘭夫人來，就不必再用畫面來重複醫生的話，而且蘭蓀已經在畫面上早已打電給她了，幽蘭這一邊還去做許多瑣碎的表情，在電話中同又用對話重複了醫生看病的塲面。小孩病了缺席，是不用點名就可爲一個母親而兼先生的所知道的，第二次點名是多餘了。由於對白與畫面不能相成地應用，就由零亂與重複使全片散漫鬆懈得减少了劇的力量。</p>
<p>作爲有聲片之主要部分的語言，乃是有聲片的决定意義的，可是「　珠」中的說話，就有太不眞實之感。中國有聲電影的舞台語化，原不自「　珠」始，「桃李劫」的前半部的語言，也同樣是太做作與誇張。我們知道舞台上因爲要使更多的觀衆聽得淸楚，所以不能不比平常做作誇張了些，而聲片因有擴音機的效用，做作與誇張就不但不自然，而且反有害處。「　珠」除了語調的做作與誇張，在雇用使女那一段對話，又如京戲旦角那麽的尖銳。</p>
<p>化裝在這兒也没有很好的應用，除了有些人的不曾用化裝來帮助表情外，范雪朋的眼部化裝在俯視時比打腫了還難看。</p>
<p>做良彥的小孩的聲音和面部都不適合，我想用一個比較俏瘦與活潑的人演來，當更能現出劇中人的可憐與可愛，以增加劇的效果的。</p>
<p>演員中以葉秋心與魏鵬飛爲較好。范雪朋也許是不大適合於演這種戲，所以只是平平而已。</p>

<p>拉斯基｜福斯製作　約翰巴爾斯，羅蘭妲楊等主演</p>
<p>密契李德醫院新招了七十五個看護士，裹面有瓊，齊妲，葛蘭弟，哥娣羅，玻琪等等。瓊慧中秀外，顯然係其中的翹楚。她選中了善於羞澀的齊妲，做她的同房，而葛蘭弟和哥娣羅，亦就凑在一起了。齊妲初入醫院，工作過於煩重，頗有不勝之慨，並且懷念故鄕的愛人，終日鬱鬱無歡。瓊爲了要安慰齊妲，就說她自己亦有一個愛人的，那愛人不是别人，就是舉國聞名的馬球健將，富家子龍納華爾第三，因爲她們談話的時候，她們正翻着一張報紙，而龍納的照相，剛巧顯露在她們的面前，所以瓊就信口開河也。不想齊妲果然相信了。等到後來一班新看護，跑到附近一爿藥房裹，去吃冰淇淋和麥牙牛奶的時候，齊妲就將瓊說的話，和大家講了。大家聽了，亦就相信了，惟有哥娣羅自負不凡，不相信瓊就是龍納華爾第三的甜心。她公然地表示她不相信，於是就和葛蘭弟爭論起來，各不相下。於是她們二人就打賭。哥娣羅立即冩了一封信給龍納華爾，請他明白答復，到底他和瓊有婚約的關係没有。龍納華爾收到了哥娣羅的信，知道有人在冒稱他的未婚妻，就很生氣，不過他的一位秘書却很知趣。他代龍納覆了一封信給哥娣羅，對於龍納華爾和瓊的婚約，竟馬馬虎虎，没有加以否認。這樣哥娣羅的東道就輸了，而哥娣羅於惱羞成怒之餘，就專心要向瓊乘𨻶報仇。果然到了瓊在練習做病人的時候，哥娣羅就想害她一下子，但是給看護班的主任，大胖子莎萊救了她。</p>
<p>到了六個月試用期滿的時候，起初十個第一班看護之中，有好幾個受了徵别而解除職務了。但是其中有一個南方女子，呌恩娜的，她平時旣不用功，亦不發愁，可是到了時候，居然也及格保留了。後來瓊又居然和龍納華爾第三成了相識。事有凑巧，那一天報紙上大字登載着，龍納華爾要來了。哥娣羅爲了要證明瓊和龍納，到底有婚約關係没有，特爲帶了幾個同伴到中央車站，看瓊到底來不來。瓊果然來了。正在龍納華爾下了火車，要跨進汽車的時候，瓊奔了上去，將龍納推上了汽車，自己亦跳了進去，連忙吩咐汽車開走了。瓊在汽車裹，很羞澀地向龍納道歉，吿訴他受了同伴的壓迫，不得不如此做法的理由。龍納這才想起了從前他收到的那封信，原來假冐他未婚妻的，就是這個人。可是瓊秀色可餐，現在和她同車，未免一見生情，三生有幸。他非但答應了瓊的請求，暫時代瓊裝足面子。並且送佛送到西天，他竟陪了瓊，去到醫院附近的藥房裹。那裹一般看護，都圍攏來看瓊的未婚夫。瓊一一替她們介紹了。龍納還每人送了她們大包的糖果。於是哥娣羅亦就無話可說了。不過天下的事，弄假成眞，在他未離開那個地方之前，他已確實和瓊掉在愛情的深淵了。（未完）</p>

<p>(Changsha) Zhou Hunyuan's troops rushed to Zhenyuan and, joining Wu Qiwai's army, engaged in fierce battles with the pseudo 13th and 2nd Army Corps. Over a thousand bandits were killed, and Zhenyuan City was recovered at dusk on the 27th. A portion of the bandits fled westward towards Lushan via Shibing and Huangping, while another portion fled northwest towards Yuqing and Shiqian. The Qian army and You army are both stationed in the Lushan area to prevent bandits from infiltrating internally. Liu and Xue's various units are pursuing and blocking them along different routes. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military News: Wang Jialie's troops and the Central Army's subordinate units recaptured Zhenyuan on the afternoon of the 28th. The bandits fled towards the Shiqian and Yinjiang areas. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>◎ Guiyang The Central Army and Qian Army's Cai Brigade recaptured Zhenyuan on the afternoon of the 28th, with numerous captures and killings. The bandits fled towards the Shiqian and Yinjiang areas. Furthermore, a portion of the bandits fled across Huangping and Yuqing, fleeing towards Longxi. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>◎ Guiyang After being defeated on the 28th, the bandits defended Zhenxiong Pass, but were subsequently defeated by Xue Yue's troops. On the 29th, the Central Army, with Wu's column, launched a fierce attack from Zhenyuan towards the Shibing-Huangping line. Zhou's column launched an attack and suppression against the bandits in Huangping via Sansui, through the Shidongkou, Wenggu, and Long area, with the hope of achieving a pincer attack in conjunction with the Qian Army. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Yang Sen and Li Jiayu have both telegraphed Liu Xiang, reorganizing their armies and awaiting orders for a general offensive against the bandits. Furthermore, Yang Sen has scheduled a grand review of the troops stationed in Shunqing and the volunteer army and student army, along with demonstrations of national martial arts, horse racing competitions, and soccer matches on New Year's Day at the Tumen Temple Grand Training Ground outside the South Gate of Shunqing.

<p>(Beiping) The remnants of Liu Guitang's bandits in the Mentougou, Mayu Village, and Dahui Field areas have been routed towards Qitang and Yanchi and other places as a result of suppression efforts by Wan Fulin's troops. These areas have now been surrounded by Tang's troops. The bandits are hiding in various mountain valleys. At dawn today, the battalion sent teams into the mountains to search and has trapped the bandits in the core. Due to the bandits carrying a large number of internal tickets, it is inconvenient to launch a fierce attack, so they are simply being surrounded and a solution is being sought gradually. It is reported that when the bandits fled from Yixian, Fangshan, and other places, they looted along the way, leaving ten houses empty out of every ten. According to intelligence, the bandits plan to flee to Changping, attempting to join the small contingent of Yang Hou, who is plotting a mutiny in the Shangdu area, along the Ping-Sui Railway line. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tong County reports by telephone that after the remnants of Liu's bandits once again disrupted the war zone, they were intercepted by local militia and police along the way, and small groups of three to five bandits are roaming in various townships, disturbing the local area. Tong County, in order to prevent scattered bandits from entering the city, has imposed temporary martial law starting from the 29th, with the garrison troops and the county Public Security Bureau responsible for security. Entrances and exits at all city gates are subject to strict inspection, and nighttime patrols are especially strict. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Near Dongshimen in Tong County, over two hundred remnants of Liu Guitang's troops have been discovered. The 32nd Army has dispatched troops to block and attack them. They have now fled towards the Sanhe and Bindi areas. Upon receiving the report, the Hebei Provincial Government has ordered the security teams and defense corps of these two counties and neighboring counties to implement strict prevention and blockade measures to prevent them from flowing into the war zone. Two hundred members of Liu's bandits are currently surrounded in the mountains around Qitang near Pingxi Mentougou, and the military and police are strictly preventing them from fleeing elsewhere.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding Japan's announcement of the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, a reporter inquired on the 30th with a senior official familiar with the diplomatic situation. According to him, although Japan has now announced the abandonment of the naval treaty, it will not take effect until after December 31, 1936. There will be no significant impact in these two years. However, the secret expansion of armaments by various countries is an inevitable trend. If a new agreement can be generated in the future to replace the treaty, it will naturally continue to maintain the current peaceful situation. Otherwise, not only will naval disarmament be affected, but general disarmament will also suffer adversely. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Soviet Russian Returnee Discusses the Situation of Russo-Japanese Preparations for War; Difficult to Erupt Immediately <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A gentleman who returned from Russia said, regarding the atmosphere of Russo-Japanese war, from a superficial observation, there is a possibility of war between the two sides. But in reality, Japan's land and sea defenses in the three northeastern provinces have not been completed, and Russia's heavy industry also needs to continue its efforts, which cannot be arranged in a short period of time. It is too early to talk about war at this time. The tense situation on the borders of the two countries proves the danger of both sides fearing war. According to what the Russians have passed down, Japan's plan for dealing with the war with Russia is to adopt an elliptical folding fan shape, using Xinjiang as a base for cutting off the land army connection between Russia. Inner Mongolia is used as a base for cutting off the connection between Outer Mongolia and Russia. The center of military command focuses on the northern route, while the main force is in the central route. Negotiations between Russia and Japan on the eastern railway have been going on for a long time. On the surface, it is due to issues such as price and retirement pay for Russian employees. In fact, it is a means of suppressing war. The Japanese could have seized the entire Eastern Railway's business rights without spending a penny, but they were afraid that the war would break out quickly, which would be unfavorable to them. Therefore, on the surface, they used a buying and selling policy to ease the Russian atmosphere, while in reality, they intensified military preparations. The Russians also knew the Japanese methods, but because their own heavy industry had not yet been completed, they also took the same approach, dealing with each other with duplicity. Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, commercial friendship has been increasing day by day. They have the greatest hope for the future of China's revitalization, and they hope that China can have far-reaching plans so that there are no barriers between the two countries. As for all other issues, as long as China itself has a solution, the solution will not be a problem. The Soviet Union's construction focuses on heavy industry, and it employs more than 1,000 foreign technicians who are distributed in various industrial areas to provide guidance. Collective systems are emphasized for factory construction and the people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The largest factories often have more than 100,000 workers, and the smallest factories also have thousands of workers. The buildings are all large Western-style houses with dozens of floors. Small family-style Western houses like those in China are not often seen. The rate of political decision-making is very high. The most important official business can be completed in a few tens of minutes, and less important matters cannot exceed one day. Otherwise, the person in charge will be severely punished.

<p>(Beiping) Guangdong Central Committee member Guan Suru and Li Qi'an arrived in Beijing this morning. According to them, because they have been in the south for a long time, they are taking a New Year's holiday after attending the Fifth Plenary Session to visit friends in Beijing and visit scenic spots and have no mission.

<h3 id="e13">Beijing City Salt District Decides to Open on New Year's Day <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Limited to Fine Salt, Huainan, and Huaibei Salt Merchants</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The opening date for the salt district in this city has been decided as New Year's Day. The Salt Affairs Administration has ordered the Huaibei Salt Transport Envoy Office, the Huainan Deputy Office, and the Xiaguan Inspection Bureau to instruct the salt merchants to comply. This opening is not the entire Jiangpu six salt bank, but the Beijing city area carved out of the salt bank and is limited to three types of salt merchants: fine salt, Huainan, and Huaibei. Not all salt merchants across the country can freely sell in Beijing. Therefore, the name is the free salt district of Huainan, Huaibei, and Jing salt carved out of the six salt banks of Jiangpu with restrictions in Beijing city. From now on, any merchant can transport and sell Huainan salt to Beijing. There were originally 13 fine salt companies in the country. In addition to the six Yingkou companies that have been banned from selling, there are also seven companies, including Jiuda, Yongyu, Tongyi, Wuhe, Minsheng, and Dingyi. Among them, the former four are setting up distribution offices in Xiaguan, and they will simultaneously enter the city for business at that time. Fine salt is all packaged, with each package weighing thirteen taels and six qian. In recent years, business has declined, and most have reduced the weight to increase revenue. In order to eliminate malpractices, the authorities decided to rectify the package weight in addition to opening up the city. All Huai salt and fine salt imports must be weighed, calculated at 100 catties per load according to the market scale. As for the selling price, it will be according to the original price without increasing or decreasing. The current cost of each load of salt is about two yuan, plus a registration fee of more than seven yuan per load, totaling about more than nine yuan, so the price per catty is about nine to ten cents.

<p>(Tianjin) The Yutian Second District Militia, totaling over two hundred men, are under the jurisdiction of Wang Bingxiao. The militiamen are recruited from various villages. The original regulations stipulated a monthly salary of eight yuan per person, with food expenses shared by the villages. When the salary was issued on the 28th, due to insufficient funds, only five yuan was issued per person, deducting three yuan for food expenses. The militiamen refused to accept this and gathered to make a public disturbance. That night, sixty men mutinied and were surrounded and disarmed by Wang Bingxiao's troops. However, the remaining men are also unstable. On the 29th, they formed a confrontational situation with the militia of Ya Hongqiao. The security team took the opportunity to agitate, and the situation is very bad. The gentry of various villages are currently trying their best to mediate. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

On the 28th, because Zhang Xiaoxuan's father and son, residents of Dananzhuang in the eighth district of the defense area, were extremely poor and unable to pay the donation, the team sent more than ten soldiers to arrest them in the middle of the night. All three of the father and sons were shot and killed. Zhang's daughter-in-law, filled with grief and indignation, committed suicide by hanging. The whole family died tragically.

In the more than sixty villages they passed, all the property was looted, and countless men and women held for ransom were killed. More than two hundred people were kidnapped. On the morning of the 29th, they engaged in a fierce battle with the Yishui militia in Houfuying.

<h3 id="e20">A Review of Global Economic Trends in the Past Year (Part 2) by Tong <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Amidst the global economic downturn, Japan's economic situation alone is gradually improving. Its courage to move forward has caused unease and resistance among various countries. Japan's industrial economy has four major pillars: (1) rice, (2) silk cocoons, (3) export industries, and (4) military industries. Except for rice and silk cocoons, which have become pressing rural problems due to last year's bumper harvest and the drop in the U.S. raw silk market, the export and military industries are experiencing rapid development. In terms of rice production in rural areas, it exceeded 70 million *koku* in 1933. In addition, Korea and Taiwan produced over 20 million *koku* of rice, making it a rare bumper year for Japan. As a result, rice prices fell excessively, and the government is striving for rice control and adjustment of rice from overseas territories. The main purpose of the Rice Control Law is to consider both the cost of rice production and the livelihood of the people, and to determine the highest and lowest rice prices every December. Based on these prices, rice is bought and sold. On December 16, 1933, the Rice Control Committee decided that the highest price would be 30 yen and 50 sen, and the lowest price would be 23 yen and 30 sen. To date, the government's expenditure on rice purchased has exceeded 500 million yen.</p>
<p>Although rice prices have risen daily since the government's purchases, some rural areas still face food shortages due to the bumper harvest. For example, farmers in Niigata Prefecture appealed to the government at the end of April this year for the allocation of old rice stocks for relief due to rice shortages. Moreover, many farmers in remote rural areas grow rice but cannot afford to eat it. This is mainly due to improper distribution.</p>
<p>Silkworm cocoons are the second most important product for Japanese farming households. However, in the past year, the sluggish raw silk market has led to extremely low prices. In the spring of 1933, silk prices rose to 1,000 yen, but by the turn of summer and autumn, they plummeted to half the value of 500 yen. This was because Roosevelt's New Deal revival movement was initially vigorous but faltered after summer. Japan's raw silk exports account for more than 80% of its total output, and most of it is exported to the United States. Therefore, Japanese products account for 95% of the raw silk consumed in the United States. The state of the Japanese silk cocoon market depends entirely on the prosperity or decline of the American market. According to the National Textile Association of America, the consumption of raw silk in the year from July 1933 to June 1934 was 440,000 bales, the lowest consumption since 1925. In recent years, the widespread sale of rayon has also greatly developed this industry, posing a significant threat to the future of Japanese raw silk.</p>
<p>Japan's export industries have indeed experienced rapid growth. The fundamental reason for this is that Japan's machinery industry seized the opportunity when European countries were preoccupied with the European War and made great strides. It broke away from the era of imitating Europe and America and entered an organization of original production. At the same time, it strived to rationalize production, making management methods more rigorous, and meticulously studied technological progress to ensure excellent product quality and low costs, in order to complete its dumping policy. As a result of expanding old markets and developing new markets in recent years, Japanese goods had an export value of 1.861 billion yen in 1933, an increase of 62.3% compared to 1931. By May of this year, the cumulative amount was approximately 820 million yen, an increase of 22.9% compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>In addition, in the Far East, Soviet Russia recently announced that it would abolish the rationing system from January 1, 1935. Amidst the approaching end of the year, this move by Soviet Russia adds new data to the world's economic history. Since 1929, Soviet Russia has implemented a rationing system as part of its Five-Year Plan. All people had to buy bread and other daily necessities with ration tickets. On November 28 of this year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party passed a resolution applying to the Council of People's Commissars to abolish this system. Chairman Molotov of the Council of People's Commissars also reported to the meeting that this measure would stimulate the progress of agriculture and industry, reduce market prices, and increase workers' wages, in order to consolidate the ruble and develop trade. The plenary session adopted seven other measures. From the plans formulated, it can be seen that the Soviet Russian economy will return to the New Economic Policy of 1921 and gradually tend toward a capitalist structure. This point is a unique change in the world economy in 1934. How the world economy will change in the future, how can we predict?</p>

<p>◎San Pedro, California:  Japan announced the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty today. Simultaneously, U.S. Navy Fleet Commander Admiral Reeves released an unprecedented plan for U.S. naval maneuvers in the Pacific. The exercises, scheduled from May 3 to June 10 next summer, will cover approximately 5 million square miles throughout the Eastern Pacific, nearly reaching the Eastern Sea. The fleet assembled at sea under a single commander will be the most formidable in world naval history. A total of 177 warships will participate, along with 577 naval aircraft, the naval airship Macon, and four aircraft carriers. The naval officers, men and operators will total 55,000. The fleet will be divided into three parts, based at Honolulu, the Aleutian Islands, and Midway Island in the North Pacific. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>◎St. Paul, USA:  U.S. Fleet Commander Admiral Reeves announced today that the U.S. fleet will conduct its largest naval exercise in history next summer. The exercise area will be in the North Pacific, extending from the Aleutian Islands in the north to Midway Island in the south, and reaching the Californian coast in the east. Reeves mentioned that the U.S. fleet may sail to Wake Island, which is closer to Japan than the United States, but he did not explicitly state this. Wake Island is located approximately midway between the Hawaiian Islands and Japan. In April next year, the fleet will concentrate in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and Puget Sound. The exercise period will last for several months. The Patrol Force originally stationed along the Atlantic coast will also pass through the Panama Canal in mid-March to participate. The timing of Reeves' announcement, coinciding with Japan's notification of treaty abrogation, is considered very significant. Participating in the exercise will be battleships, cruisers, destroyers, torpedo boat destroyers, torpedo boats, and</p>
<p>other auxiliary warships, totaling 177 vessels, 577 aircraft, and the large airship Macon. Midway Island, northwest of the Hawaiian Islands, will serve as the forward base for the fleet. During the exercise, battleships will sail west to Wake Island. Some ships of the Asiatic Fleet may meet the battle fleet and patrol fleet in the central Pacific. Reeves also stated that during the exercise, the U.S. fleet will be divided into three groups. The Southern Fleet will advance westward from San Diego and San Pedro to Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands, while the Northern Fleet will secretly proceed from the Aleutian Islands to the secret naval port that the naval air force has quietly established in recent years.

<h3 id="e22">Japan's Treaty Abrogation is a Retrogressive Act Threatening World Peace; Its Impact Concerns All Treaties Related to the Far East; The Key to the Situation Lies in Britain's Hands <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) American figures believe that Japan's declaration of treaty abrogation will have a profound impact on world peace. From now on, naval and commercial competition in the United States, the Far East, South America, and other areas of the Pacific will intensify. The entire relationship between Britain and the United States will also be called into question. While the fundamental rapprochement between Britain and the United States due to Japan is possible, the dream of a united Anglo-Saxon race, at least in spirit, may be shattered. This is because the U.S. Navy wants to maintain its superiority over Japan while maintaining equality with Britain. However, Britain intends to have a navy capable of resisting the combined forces of the two major European naval powers. Italy wants to maintain a navy equal to that of France, while France wants its navy to be able to resist the combined navies of Italy and Germany. The naval competition between France and Italy compels Britain to build new ships, which in turn triggers competition between Britain and the United States. The reason why the dream of Anglo-Saxon unity may not be realized lies here. Moreover, the U.S. government believes that the Washington Naval Treaty stipulated that Britain and the United States maintain the status quo in certain territories or dependencies in the Pacific and not add new defensive works (Washington Naval Treaty, Article 19) because Japan recognized the 5:5:3 ratio. Now that Japan has declared the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty and no longer recognizes the existing ratio, the provision prohibiting the addition of defensive works in the Pacific dependencies naturally loses its effect. At the same time, the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing the Open Door Policy in China and the Four-Power Treaty guaranteeing the territories of the signatory countries in the Far East will also lose their effect due to the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty. (Note: The Four-Power Treaty was signed simultaneously with the Washington Naval Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty. The signatories were Britain, the United States, France, and Japan. Its main purpose was to maintain general peace and maintain and respect the rights of each country in all islands and territories in the Pacific, replacing the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.) In addition, the Dutch East Indies occupy a very important strategic position. Since the Washington Treaties have become invalid, there is no protection. People are quite worried about Japan's future intentions toward the island. Now the key to the situation undoubtedly lies in Britain's hands. Americans hope that Britain and the United States can negotiate, even if they cannot conclude an alliance, they can also closely cooperate due to Japan in order to resist Japan in future naval conferences. However, the United States deeply fears that Britain will eventually abandon the Open Door Policy in China in exchange for commercial interests in Manchuria, and that Britain will express sympathy with Japan on naval issues, disregarding the opinions of the United States and deciding to increase the number of British light cruisers. The United States' modification of the principle of freedom of the seas is mostly to please Britain. As for establishing friendly relations with Soviet Russia, preparing to open the new Nicaragua Canal, and preparing to establish naval and air force bases along the coast of Alaska, these are to resist Japan's power in the Far East.

<h3 id="e23">Notifying the Abrogation; Saito Issues a Declaration Hypocritically Expressing Goodwill Towards the United States; Naval Stance Remains Unchanged <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito entered the State Department today to formally present U.S. Secretary of State Hull with a written notification that Japan is abrogating the Washington Naval Treaty and will no longer be bound by the treaty after December 31, 1936. He stated that Japan's abrogation of the treaty is entirely due to the existing inequality in naval armaments, which is not suitable for Japan's national defense security and impairs its national prestige. Saito spoke with Hull for 15 minutes and concluded by saying that Japan does not intend to initiate the reopening of naval negotiations but is willing to cooperate with all countries to establish a new convention. If the United States, Britain, and Japan can agree on a common minimum naval limit, Japan is willing to abandon half of its existing navy. He does not fear that Japan's abrogation of the treaty may cause a naval race. All relevant people are very enlightened, and their governments are all rational. No one will engage in a damaging naval shipbuilding race. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After conveying the official explanation of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Secretary of State Hull today, Ambassador Saito made his personal statement, expressing his confidence that the friendship between Japan and the United States in the past and the talents of statesmen will continue to maintain peace and establish a mutually satisfactory agreement. Saito also called for the establishment of a new treaty to achieve universal disarmament, saying that Japan has proposed the complete abolition of battleships and aircraft carriers and is prepared to reduce half of its existing naval strength. "We are willing to reduce as much as possible on both material and moral grounds to relieve all countries of the fear of war. We want other countries to have no fear of us, and we also want us to have no fear of other countries." Saito said that Japan's demand for equality is a prerequisite for reducing naval strength. "The major naval powers each have difficult tasks within their own countries and their respective spheres of influence. They have no time to consider fighting with other countries. Therefore, an agreement between the three countries should be established on a reasonable basis as soon as possible. Fortunately, there is still plenty of time to hesitate before the notification of abrogation takes effect, and even if a concrete agreement cannot be reached, I have no fear, because the people of the three countries are all knowledgeable, and the governments of the three countries are also deeply aware of the situation. No one wants to engage in a naval construction competition." Ambassador Saito expressed great satisfaction with the efforts of Japan and the United States to curb war rhetoric. His conclusion was, "I observe that the past friendship and the talents of statesmen in both countries have been able to solve many problems, so my hope always exists."

<h3 id="e24">Hull's Reply: Willing to Cooperate to Seek Peace; Equal Rights Must Consider National Defense Needs; US Always Relies on This as the Foundation of Diplomacy <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Hull's response takes a sympathetic attitude toward Japan, but expresses regret for Japan's actions. He said that all countries are now willing to treat other countries on a basis of absolute equality, but experience tells us that countries seek equality of armaments regardless of their different defense needs. This is not the way to promote peace or implement disarmament. Washington views Japan's treaty abrogation with regret, but we acknowledge that all countries have the right to reject the continuation of treaties. Any action tending towards disarmament must have voluntary consent in order to be effective. Seeking peace through disarmament and cooperation remains the basis of American foreign policy. The United States is willing to negotiate with all countries when there is hope of obtaining a mutually satisfactory outcome in order to prevent countries from being burdened by avoidable excessive military expenditure. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull, after receiving the notification from Japan declaring the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty, immediately sent a reply to Ambassador Saito stating that the notification had been received. He then issued a statement to the press stating that Japan had the right to declare the abrogation of the treaty, but this move was regrettable. Hull then referred to the London naval talks and their friendly and sincere spirit, saying that any country has the right to demand equality in security and peace, but merely demanding equality of armaments without considering the national defense needs of each country is of no benefit to disarmament. The Washington Naval Treaty stipulates methods for naval powers to cooperate in disarmament, making the peaceful environment even more fulfilling. Although Japan has declared the abrogation of the treaty, there are still two years until the expiration of the treaty, which allows time to consider the consequences of the complete abandonment of the treaty. Therefore, the United States is prepared to participate in future naval talks that can avoid the heavy burden of naval expenditure and satisfy the United States and other nations. Hull concluded, "The American nation, based on sincere friendship and the spirit of treating other nations, will continue to work hard to encourage other countries to emulate." (Havas, 29th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Japan's formal notification of the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty was delivered by Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito to Secretary of State Hull a few minutes after noon today. The procedure took place in Hull's office. Coincidentally, outside the window was the memorial to the war dead of the European War.

<p>entered the room to report. Hull immediately invited Saito inside, shook hands to show welcome, and closed the door for a private conversation. However, after receiving the Japanese notification, Hull immediately summoned his secretary to send copies of the notification to the representatives of the three signatory countries, Britain, France, and Italy. It is expected that they can be delivered today. According to government statements, the United States will formally notify Japan that it has received the notification. Although Washington is not surprised by the abrogation of the treaty, all government authorities deeply feel that Japan's actions are a retrogressive act against world peace. Some senior officials of the Navy Department blame the abrogation of the treaty on the United States because the United States did not expand its naval strength to the extent permitted by the treaty. They believe that the original 5:5:3 ratio was based on the original tonnage of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and Japan, but did not take into account the warships that were already being built in each country at that time.

<h3 id="e26">Britain Believes that Naval Compromise is Not Hopeless; Proposes to Reconcile American and Japanese Differences through Qualitative Disarmament <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(London) The world's political circles today all regarded Japan's formal abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty as their sole topic of conversation. Britain and the United States are very disappointed that Japan has abandoned the treaty, which has been effective in limiting the expansion of armaments and reversing the naval race, but do not consider it hopeless. The hope that exists in the eyes of the British is that Japan has not revealed any intention to abolish the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty. These two treaties, like the Washington Naval Treaty, are the organization of peace in the Pacific group. However, once the Washington Treaty is abolished, it will be possible to raise political questions when future naval talks are resumed. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) Japan has formally announced the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty. This was expected. The impression from well-informed sources in Britain is that the declaration of abrogation is merely the end of one chapter in the naval issue. However, the system established by the Washington Naval Treaty has not collapsed. Therefore, the general concept is neither optimistic nor pessimistic. Official speeches by British figures often state that not only is it possible to reduce naval armaments, but it is also possible to reduce land and air force armaments. This is a phrase commonly used by officials. Recently, Foreign Secretary Simon declared in Parliament that equality in the quantity of armaments and seeking equality in security are two different issues. At the last few meetings between the British and American representatives, the British delegation declared to the American delegation that Britain had saved hundreds of millions of dollars in its budget and avoided serious incidents in diplomacy in the thirteen years since the Washington Naval Treaty was implemented. Therefore, Britain's desire to maintain the fundamental principles of the Washington Naval Treaty is the same as that of the United States. Now that the Washington Naval Treaty has been declared abolished by Japan, Britain does not believe that the naval disarmament issue has reached a point of no return. Because in the initial talks of this naval conference, both sides often used domestic public opinion as an excuse and insisted on not making concessions on principles that were difficult to disagree with. In fact, what both sides were arguing about was purely national dignity. Britain is fully aware of this. Moreover, since the dispute over naval issues, British figures, in light of the thinking of Japan and the United States, believe that if negotiations are conducted through diplomatic procedures, it may be easier to reconcile. Today, someone has said that Britain has a proposal prepared to seek a basis for compromise between the three countries on qualitative disarmament. Success in this matter will naturally take quite some time, but the fact that there is such a motivation on the day the treaty abrogation is announced shows that Britain's desire to achieve a compromise is very strong. With this desire, Britain will use all methods and do its best to mediate so that the next naval conference can be convened and achieve success. (Havas, 29th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Morning Post published an article by Admiral de Taokudier today, stating that when the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922 and the London Naval Treaty was signed in 1930, the German Navy had not been reorganized and the Italian Navy was insignificant. Now that times have changed, France sincerely approves of the declaration of abrogation of the two treaties by legal procedures. If this were not the case, our position would be even more inferior within three years. Therefore, the best plan for now is to immediately conclude a new agreement that is more fair and based on the current situation, which is different from the situation in 1922. However, will Germany and Soviet Russia participate in a new naval conference to negotiate a new naval agreement in the future? Moreover, due to the rapid advancement of aviation technology, there is a great possibility for the development of naval air force armaments. Then, can this new naval agreement, which does not include limitations on air force armaments, be concluded separately? Or even further, there are many dependencies in the Pacific, and all colonial countries are related to the naval and air force bases there. Therefore, the issue of naval and air force bases in the Pacific should be re-examined. (Havas, 30th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Regarding the Italian proposal to guarantee peace in Central Europe, a Paris newspaper reported today that France has drafted a compromise plan. The main idea is to divide the Central European political organization into two major parts. It is said that Italy's plan to guarantee Austrian independence will be jointly supported by Italy, Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. However, if Germany and Hungary are unwilling to sign, their positions can be left vacant, and the agreement's effectiveness will still come into effect immediately. After the first step of this diplomatic procedure is implemented, it will be followed by a second step, establishing a Central European guarantee agreement broadly based on the Balkan Entente. This agreement should also be signed by France and Romania. In this way, Italy and the Little Entente countries will be able to mutually guarantee their borders, as safeguarding borders is the fundamental goal of French foreign policy.

<p>◎Bombay The Governor-General of India recently secretly warned Gandhi that if he attempts to engage in civil disobedience again, he will be severely punished. Previously, Gandhi, on behalf of the All-India National Congress, announced the end of the civil disobedience movement, but reserved the right to personally engage in disobedience to achieve Indian autonomy. Recently, Gandhi wanted to go to the Frontier Province to promote rural economic revitalization, but the Governor-General rejected this. The Governor-General, fearing that Gandhi might resume the disobedience movement and need to be arrested, sought instructions from London. The British government seemed to advocate punishment as well. However, because Gandhi's physical condition is weak, they feared he might not be able to withstand the stimulation, and if anything unexpected happened, it would cause an accident. Therefore, they advocated only giving a warning. However, Gandhi believes that "disobedience" is a "right endowed to mankind since birth" and has always insisted on it. Therefore, the Governor-General of India will likely take stern measures. (29th Havas)</p>

The defendants were members of this organization. The organization's purpose was to disrupt the Soviet Russian government through terrorist actions and to change the current policy to "Zinoviev and Trotsky's" policy. The organization also wanted to provoke foreign military intervention. Therefore, the murderer Nikolai Nikolaev met with a consul of a certain country in Leningrad in order to achieve this goal.

<p>Li Jingxing Describes Oppression</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Regarding the Japanese expulsion of overseas Chinese, our government has repeatedly protested, but with no satisfactory results. Now, another 22 overseas Chinese compatriots, including Huang Enrong, Li Jingxing, and Lin Wanqing, have been expelled and returned to their country. On the 26th of this month, they arrived in Qingdao from Moji, Japan, aboard the Nikko Maru. After disembarking, Huang and the others went to the police station of the 3rd branch of the dock public security bureau to report their experiences of being expelled from Japan. Huang and Lin went to the Zhongxing Button Factory in Taitong Town to stay, while Li Jingxing stayed at the Taihe Inn on Taian Road. The rest were scattered in various inns. According to Li Jingxing, "I am from Zouping and was engaged in the sale of jade and coral in Japan. Huang Enrong and Lin Wanqing are from Zhaoyuan and ran a restaurant at the Yokohama dock. Most overseas Chinese in Japan live in Osaka and Tokyo, followed by Yokohama and Kobe. Most overseas Chinese from North China are engaged in commerce, while those from South China mostly run restaurants or sell their labor. However, the Japanese have recently been very discriminatory towards overseas Chinese, using all means of humiliation and exploitation, and simply do not treat them as human beings. This is all because of our weakness. When the Japanese see us, they often say, 'All the Japanese money has been earned by you.' Now, the Japanese can still tolerate wealthy overseas Chinese, but for those without money, such as laborers and us merchants, they mostly find small faults without reason, detain them in Japanese government offices, and forcibly send them back to their home country when there is a ship available, unwilling to tolerate them for a moment. Those working in Japan used to earn more than two yuan a day, but now it has been reduced to one yuan or eight jiao, and most are unable to make a living. However, the Japanese are still afraid that the overseas Chinese will take their jobs, so they deposit all the surplus of the overseas Chinese's daily wages, except for room and board, on their behalf, and when there is enough money for the return trip, they are expelled back to their country, unwilling to tolerate them for a moment. In recent years, I don't know how many batches of overseas Chinese have been expelled back to their country by the Japanese. I remember that last time there were 26 overseas Chinese who were expelled back to their country, five of whom had married Japanese women. The feelings between the couples were very good, and the Japanese women also wanted to come to China with their husbands. Who knew that when they arrived in Kobe, they were forcibly detained by the Japanese police. The reason for my (Li referring to himself) expulsion this time was that on the 13th and 14th of this month, I joked with a waitress (female) in a Japanese restaurant, and the Japanese suspected that I had committed adultery. They immediately reported it to the police, and without asking questions, they forcibly sent me back to my country. In short, it is very dangerous for overseas Chinese in Japan who are laborers and merchants. Now, they are returning in batches, which has a great impact on people's livelihoods. But what can our weak China do to help? This time, there were six of us who were sent to the ship together in Yokohama, and the rest were sent on in Moji. When we left, the Japanese police led us to the Chinese consulate and said that they wanted to send us back to our country. The consulate had no way to help and could only let them do as they pleased. Now that we have returned to our country, I would rather starve to death in my own country than go back to Japan to be bullied by them." He was overcome with sadness. (26th)</p>

<h3 id="e73">The Fate of the Okada Cabinet (Japanese Dispatch) Party Decline, Okada Ascends, Limited Finances, Takahashi Returns <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>When Keisuke Okada, a naval admiral, first formed his cabinet, it was derided as second-rate. This was because he himself was not a politician, and he lacked a clear political program capable of rallying the masses. He was merely being used by elder statesmen and influential figures as a symbol of constitutional government, to ease the conflict between civilian and military rule, in the expectation that an opportunity would arise in the future to restore constitutional government. Another very important matter was the so-called crisis of 1936, which was particularly acute in the maritime sphere. It was truly not easy for Japan to find a suitable figure capable of harmonizing military affairs, politics, finance, and the economy.</p>
<p>The previous Prime Minister, Makoto Saito, seemed broad-minded and tolerant, allowing the ministers in his cabinet to manage their respective departments independently. In particular, both the army and navy were able to fully exert their abilities. Unexpectedly, the "Teikoku Rayon Company" bribery case implicated Finance Vice-Minister Kuroda through the Bank of Taiwan. At the same time, Finance Minister Takahashi also bore responsibility for negligence or inadequate supervision of his subordinates. As a result, the Saito cabinet was naturally embarrassed to continue. However, its mission – to overcome the extraordinary period – had not yet ended. Therefore, after consultation among elder statesmen and influential figures, Okada was recommended to take office, with the aim of extending the Saito cabinet. The underlying intention was to prevent the hardliners in the military (who advocated national socialism) from overstepping their bounds, and to find a way to overcome the difficult hurdle of the naval disarmament conference. Okada himself had considerable experience in military and political affairs, but he was not very adept in politics. However, he was a very simple and honest man, and he was well-regarded within the navy. Therefore, his appointment as Prime Minister at this time had a moderating effect. However, his debating skills were very poor, and his ability to handle the Diet was truly lacking. In the past, during the extraordinary session of the Diet, Seiwa-kai Diet member Ando Junsei questioned Vice-Minister Tanaka of the Colonial Affairs Ministry about his reasons for resigning. Okada's answer was that Tanaka had been recommended by the Minseito party, and that the matter should be addressed to the Minseito party. His response was inadequate, and he later realized he had misspoken and retracted his answer. Such incidents occurred several times during the extraordinary session. If the Diet had authority and could uphold the spirit of parliamentary politics, then the Prime Minister's irresponsible and incoherent responses would have at least caused an uproar. The reason why he was able to pass through unscathed was that the Diet had fundamentally lost its ability to control politics, and the shortcomings of the political parties were all too obvious, so they had no choice but to let the government do as it pleased.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the Okada cabinet that grasped the demands of the times was the reinstatement of Takahashi Korekiyo as Finance Minister. Originally, Fujii Shinobu had been in disagreement with the military over budget issues, and the revenue was insufficient. If taxes were increased according to the military's demands, it would further provoke the dissatisfaction of capitalists and the criticism of the media. Fujii resigned on the eve of the opening of the extraordinary session of the Diet. If a suitable person could not be found, the Okada cabinet might have collapsed.</p>
<p>Takahashi Korekiyo had served as president of the Seiyukai party and was a veteran of Japanese politics. His wife was from Satsuma, and his sister was married to the younger brother of Makino Nobuaki. Through blood ties, he had deep connections with the Satsuma clique (the naval clique). Takahashi himself had previously served as Finance Minister six times and was very familiar with Japan's dire political situation and economic conditions. Moreover, he had a particularly good rapport with both the army and navy. After the fall of the Terauchi cabinet in 1918, Army Minister Tanaka Giichi and Navy Minister Kato Tomosaburo competed to expand their armaments. When the Hara cabinet was almost unable to resolve the situation, Takahashi stepped in to mediate. He believed that while their "emphasis on national defense was certainly correct, it was even more important to pay attention to national strength – if financial strength was not taken into consideration, then national defense was equivalent to a pie painted on paper..." Therefore, both the army and navy believed that he was acting in the interests of the country and respected him accordingly. Even now, it remains the same. When Araki Sadao was Army Minister, he was truly independent and dismissive of everyone, but he was still very impressed by Takahashi. Therefore, he released 10 million yen from the army's budget to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, saving the previous cabinet from a crisis.</p>
<p>This time, Takahashi's reinstatement as Finance Minister was well-received by financial capital because of his superior economic expertise and his exceptional familiarity with the state of the Japanese national economy. The military also highly respected him, making him the foremost figure in the current cabinet. The Okada cabinet was thus temporarily stabilized. The 67th session of the Diet, which opened today, could do nothing about the government, or else it would have to be dissolved. (Tokyo, December 24, 1934)</p>

<p>Kong Xiangxi and Wang Chonghui Pay Respects in Succession</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang, having completed his ancestral grave sweeping in his hometown and with his toothache gradually subsiding, arrived in Hangzhou yesterday (29th) morning at 9:00 a.m., accompanied by his wife, Madame Soong Mei-ling, Central Supervisory Committee member Wang Chonghui, Song Zi'an of the Songjiang Salt Transport Office, and others, traveling by automobile from Fenghua via the Fengxin-Shao-Cao-Sheng highway. Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian, Secretaries Wang Rizhang and Mao Qingxiang, Aide-de-Camp He Yun, and over a dozen guards accompanied them. Upon receiving the news, the Zhejiang Provincial Government dispatched a police brigade from the Public Security Bureau to cross the river and provide security protection along the Xixing area highway. At 1:25 p.m., Chiang and his wife's car arrived at Xixing to cross the river, reaching the first dock at Jianggan in Hangzhou at 1:50 p.m. Among those welcoming them were Provincial Government Chairman Huang Shaohong, Provincial Committee and Secretary-General Huang Huabiao, Education Commissioner Xu Shaodi, Finance Commissioner Xu Qingfu, Provincial Party Committee members Luo Xiatian, Hu Jianzhong, Fang Qingru, Ye Suchong, Wang Tingyang, Aviation School Principal Zhou Zhirou, Political Training Director Jiang Jianren, Aviation School Principal Huang Zhenqiu, High Court President Zheng Wenli, Deputy Security Director Xuan Tiewu, as well as representatives from various organizations and hundreds of members of the Provincial Government Military Band. Security was tight at the dock. After disembarking, Chiang and his wife shook hands with Huang Shaohong and doffed their hats to greet the welcoming personnel. Chiang was dressed in a gray leather robe, with a black cloak over it, looking very energetic, but his face appeared somewhat gaunt. They immediately took a car to the Cheng Lu residence for rest. They then received Huang Shaohong and his wife, Wang Chonghui, Xu Qingfu, Xu Shaodi, Kong Xiangxi, and others.

<p>Preparing to Move the Puppet Capital to Chengde in Wartime</p>
<p>Also to Instigate and Direct the Plot to Advance into North China</p>
<p>Chengde Dispatch: The Japanese-puppet regime believes that the Rehe Qing Dynasty Imperial Palace has been in disrepair for many years, with crumbling walls and dilapidated palaces. Recently, they specially hired Japanese Dr. Ito to survey and estimate the cost, formulating a complete renovation plan requiring approximately five million silver dollars. The Japanese are also trying to stabilize the morale of the people in the Northeast, outwardly still promoting the Mongolian people's love of Buddhism, so they are repairing the Eight Great Temples and the ancient temples and pagodas of Rehe to deceive the masses. In essence, Japan has largely completed the Northeast Railway Network, which is a national defense tool, and they have considerable confidence in it. They want to realize their direct control over the Northeast regime and plan to move the puppet emperor to Chengde. Therefore, they are instigating the repair of the Rehe headquarters in order to instigate and direct the invasion of North China from nearby. In their consultation with the puppet authorities, they claim that the relationship between Japan and Russia has reached a critical stage, and that once they come into contact, Changchun will be close to the front lines, with no safe haven. It will likely become a target for Russian bombing. Therefore, they are repairing the Rehe headquarters in advance in preparation for moving the capital to Chengde when necessary. Puppet Premier Zheng Xiaoxu previously flew to Chengde to inspect the Eight Great Temples, which was actually to assess the headquarters' renovation plan. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Chiang Ting-wen Plans to Eliminate Remaining Bandits in Fujian Province <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Various Armies Will Coordinate Actions</p>
<p>Northwestern Fujian Remnant Bandits Suffered a Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: After Chiang Ting-wen assumed the position of Pacification Commissioner of Fujian, he scheduled a province-wide pacification conference for early January of the 24th year of the Republic, to be held in Zhangzhou, convening the commanders and deputy commanders of the eastern, western, southern, and northern districts of Fujian, as well as the division commanders stationed in the province. Details have already been reported in the newspapers. Currently, Chiang, acting on the orders of Chairman Chiang, has been given three months to eliminate scattered bandits and pacify the local areas. During this period, both military and political sides urgently need to jointly formulate a plan to work together. The post-disaster affairs in the newly recovered counties in the western district are even more in need of immediate organization. On the 23rd, he flew from Zhangzhou to the provincial capital by plane to discuss everything with Chairman Chen Yi, and instructed Wang Jingjiu, the newly appointed Pacification Commissioner of Eastern Fujian, on measures to suppress the red bandits and pirates in the counties under Fuding's jurisdiction. Liu Heding, the Pacification Commissioner of Northern Fujian, will also come to the province soon to ask for instructions. However, recent rumors from outside indicate that Chiang will convene a pacification conference in the province soon. According to Chiang's entourage, this is not currently planned. Due to various regional and time-related factors, it would be very inconvenient for the commanders of the southwestern districts to come to the province for a conference. Therefore, he is currently only convening the commanders of the northeastern districts to give them instructions in person. A plan has been formulated. The first step is to complete the troop movements in each district, and then, based on the situation at the time, coordinate actions with each other. Chiang has now completed his official business and is scheduled to leave the province and return to Zhangzhou in four or five days.</p>
<p>After all counties in northwestern Fujian were completely recovered, the remaining bandits numbered only a little over two thousand, entrenched in the Quanshang Wucun area in the jurisdiction of Ninghua County, at the center of the border between Mingxi, Qingliu, Jianning, and Jiangle counties. Recently, the 52nd Division Commander Lu Xingrong led his troops to suppress them. In fierce battles on the 22nd and 23rd, the bandits suffered heavy casualties and were unable to hold their ground, retreating towards Miaoqian Fengxi. Division Commander Lu led his troops in pursuit. On the 24th and 25th, the bandits retreated again towards Shuixi, with only about a thousand people remaining. Commander Lu telegraphed the province yesterday to report that he was advancing from Fengxi towards Shuixi. However, there are over three thousand refugees gathered near Shuixi, lacking both food and clothing, and in urgent need of relief. (26th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Anhui Provincial Government Revises Types of Disaster Relief Grain <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Dingbu Disaster Relief Grain Collection Office Abolished</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Liu Zhenhua, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, believes that the types of disaster relief grain collected in various places in the province originally included ten types, such as black and white sesame, peanuts, sunflower seeds, melon seeds, and dried daylily and broad beans. He repeatedly requested exemptions from collection. Later, he received instructions from Chairman Chiang of the Nanchang Headquarters that the collection of disaster relief grain should be limited to what can be directly used as daily food for the people, and that collection in lieu of price or distribution in lieu of price should not be allowed. Miscellaneous grains that cannot be used as daily food or have very low yields should also be removed and exempted from collection. A revised list of types of disaster relief grain to be collected must be submitted for approval. In addition to wheat flour and rapeseed, which have already been exempted from collection, the Anhui Provincial Government specifically proposed revised lists of types of disaster relief grain to be collected and types of disaster relief grain originally collected for discussion at the provincial government's regular meeting, which has now been approved in accordance with the amendment. Furthermore, the provincial government, based on a report from Wang Youqi, Director of the Dingbu Disaster Relief Grain Office, stated that since the establishment of the Dingbu Office, the Suxu River has been dry for a long time, resulting in poor harvest. The grain from the Mei and Zhu branch offices of the general office are all exported to Liyang via the Suxu River. The Jiangsu Construction Department is currently dredging the Suxu River, and all ships have stopped running. The harvests from Mei and Zhu are completely non-existent. The river is about forty to fifty li long and cannot be dredged in a short period of time. Even after completion, this year's yield will be low due to the long drought, and future harvests will also be meager. The Jiepai branch office is also experiencing soaring grain prices, and the county government has issued a notice prohibiting transportation, making the harvest even less reliable. Therefore, it has submitted a report to the provincial government requesting that the Dingbu Disaster Relief Grain Collection Office and the Mei, Zhu, and Jiepai branch offices be abolished to avoid wasting funds. As for the Guojia Du and Huajin inspection stations, although disaster relief grain can be collected, they can be assigned to the Wuhu office for nearby management. The provincial government, recognizing the benefits of these facts, has approved the abolition of the offices and stations, and ordered the Wuhu office to collect and transport the disaster relief grain stored in Dingbu.

<h3 id="e78">Post-Disaster Work Being Handled in Southern Jiangxi <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong First Army Returns to Defend and Dispatches Troops for Pacification</p>
<p>Delegations from All Walks of Life Enter Jiangxi to Express Sympathy</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Jiangxi bandits recently fled west, leaving behind ruined houses wherever they passed. Southern Jiangxi bore the brunt of the impact and suffered the greatest losses. The area is a scene of devastation, and the local vitality urgently needs to be restored. Recently, the Guangdong First Army has been returning to their defense posts in Xinfeng, Sannan, Nankang, and Dayu. On the one hand, they are recuperating, and on the other hand, they are actively planning local construction and recruiting refugees. Yu Hanmou, the Commander of the First Army, has telegraphed his assumption of the position of Pacification Commander of the Sixth District of Jiangxi Province and is starting pacification, and has also formulated pacification measures to be implemented in order. The steps are as follows: (1) Dispatches</p>
<p>troops to search and suppress the remaining bandits, and encourages local Communists to reform themselves; (2) Conducts edification work, vigorously refutes Communist heresies, and instills the Three Principles of the People; (3) Investigates the population of villages, towns, and households in each district, and organizes joint defense; (4) Recruits refugees back to their hometowns to restore rural areas; (5) Undertakes relief efforts to support people's production; (6) Builds roads and repairs power lines; (7) Prohibits opium and gambling, and encourages mining. Of the above items, the most important is to vigorously implement pacification so that refugees can return, live in peace and work, and then all industries can be revived. However, the eleven counties in southern Jiangxi are adjacent to various places in the east, with overlapping mountains, and there are still over a thousand remnants of Ye Jianying's communist forces north of Junmen and Anyuan. Local communists frequently cause disturbances, and it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate them. The military headquarters has now dispatched portions of the Second Division under Ye Zhao to defend Gupei, Da Xiaowo, Huangni Pai, Jiudu Shui, Nankang, and Xincheng, responsible for pacifying each of those locations. It has dispatched the Independent Fourth Division under Deng Longguang to search for remaining bandits in Junmen, Xunwu, Anyuan, Chongshi, and Banshi. The First Army Training Regiment under Xie Xizhen is maintaining security near Dayu, and the Garrison Regiment under Zhao Lian is eliminating scattered bandits near Yujiang. As for local construction matters, the Pacification Headquarters is handling them separately. Previously, all sectors of Guangdong Province initiated a mass rally to express sympathy to the generals and soldiers fighting the communist bandits in southern Jiangxi, who resisted the westward fleeing brigands and defended the borders. They dispatched sympathy delegations to various destinations to express sympathy and provide supplies. The northern sympathy delegation, after departing, split into two routes to enter southern Jiangxi: one went to Xinfeng to express sympathy to the Second Division, and the other went to Dayu to express sympathy to the units subordinate to the First Army. They then returned to Nanxiong to express sympathy to the First Division and returned to Shaozhou to express sympathy to the Independent Second Brigade. On the 18th of this month, they transferred from Shaozhou to Lechang to express sympathy to the Fourth Division under Zhang Da, and then returned to Shaozhou and Guangzhou. The sympathy delegation consists of more than ten people. In each location, they held flag-giving ceremonies at the military headquarters, division headquarters, and brigade headquarters, and presented sympathy items, such as towels and other supplies. The regimental headquarters was treated to wine and meat. (December 22nd)</p>

<p>Caojing Township in Punan belongs to the eighth district of this county. Located on the coast, it has always been a haunt for bandits and robbers. This year, the township's agricultural production suffered a poor harvest, and unscrupulous elements took the opportunity to rise up, resulting in robbery cases almost every day. This has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, at about 12:00 a.m. on the 25th, the home of Zhang Wencai, a villager in the 25th Tu of Caojing, was again raided by more than a dozen bandits speaking a local dialect. They ransacked the house, looting twenty bales of cotton, two shi of rice, over ten hemp bags, over ten pieces of clothing, and a small boat, carrying the loot south and escaping. The next day, the robbed small boat was found in the Dahe Port of this Tu. The case was reported to the local police station, and a search for the robbers was launched.</p>

<p>After the Xingji Silk Factory outside the South Gate's Tieshu Bridge closed down, it owed its employees over 3,000 yuan in wages. For days, female workers petitioned to demand their wages. After mediation by the Public Security Bureau, 80% of the November wages were paid first. This situation was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now reported that at around 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the factory paid 75% of the November wages, and the Public Security Bureau and the Third Branch Bureau dispatched over 30 police officers to the factory to maintain order. Unexpectedly, Hakka female workers suddenly stopped local female workers from receiving their wages, resulting in a clash. The local female workers fled to the Third Branch Bureau of the Public Security Bureau, and the Hakka female workers followed them in, resulting in another clash with the police officers of the bureau. The two police officers who were injured, Lin Shide of Mengang and Tang Baohua of the office, were attacked. The female workers Zhou, Wang, Chen, and others also suffered serious waist injuries. The situation was serious. The branch bureau telegraphed the county government and the General Public Security Bureau, and dispatched security teams and mobile patrol teams to suppress the situation. A hooligan named Lu Hongfu, who was echoing and causing trouble, was arrested on the spot and taken to the bureau for interrogation. At the same time, the female workers were informed to receive their wages and not to cause trouble. The distribution was completed at around 6:00 p.m. The injured police officers Lin Shide and Tang Baohua, and the injured female workers Zhou, Wang, Chen, and others were sent to the Puren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Farmers in the southern Quan and Hua Dafang village areas of the third district of this county brew a small amount of wine in their spare time to prepare for self-drinking because they are near Taihu Lake and the water source is clear. This year, the Tobacco and Wine License Tax Office suddenly levied license taxes on wine-brewing farmers and arbitrarily arrested law-abiding citizens with armed police officers, resulting in disputes. Yesterday, Xu Shaoshan, Mo Yongsen, Zhang Songyun, and other representatives of wine-brewing farmers from these two towns led more than 100 villagers to petition the county government, demanding exemption from taxation. They also stated that wine-brewing households do not sell in stores and are different from taverns. The head of the second section, Fei Yunnong, came out to meet them and promised to send someone to investigate and verify the matter. They then went to the Public Security Bureau to petition, requesting the withdrawal of the eighth branch bureau and assisting police officers. Director Chen immediately dispatched Inspector Wang to meet them and instructed them that since they had filed a complaint with the provincial bureau, they should wait quietly for the province to handle the matter. The police officers assisting in the enforcement were allowed to withdraw. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>

<p>But This Is Common During the Settlement Period</p>
<p>The foreign exchange rate opened at six jiao at 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. yesterday in the money market, an increase of five fen compared to yesterday.

Although it has risen to six jiao now, this is a common occurrence during each settlement period. For example, in the years 1917, 1918, 1919, 1921, 1922, 1923, 1924, and 1932, the silver exchange rate rose to a peak of seven qian at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Hankou Chamber of Commerce Writes to Shanghai Chamber of Commerce That Legal Silver Currencies Are Universally Valid <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>No More Price Differences or Rebates Allowed</p>
<p>To Be Implemented Starting Tomorrow on New Year's Day</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "The Hankou Bankers Association and the Money Trade Association jointly issued a letter stating: 'Since the abolition of taels and the introduction of yuan, the demand for hard currency has increased. The types of hard currency in our country were originally very complex, and the weight and fineness were inconsistent. Often, coins minted in Province A cannot circulate in Province B, and this is even considered a precedent. In Hankou, only a few types of silver coins, such as those with the image of Sun Yat-sen, the images of Presidents Yuan and Xu, those made in Hubei Province, and those of the Great Qing Dynasty, have been commonly used in recent years. Other silver dollars minted in various provinces cannot be circulated arbitrarily. This situation should be restricted if the coins do not meet the legal fineness and weight. However, it is not right to reject them all indiscriminately. It is necessary to promote the unification of the monetary system. The two associations held a joint meeting on December 4th and decided to follow suit and implement it from January 1st of the 24th year. We will send separate letters to the Provincial Chambers of Commerce and ask them to inform their members.</p>

<p>The Last Batch of the Year</p>
<p>The last batch of 80,000 bags of Saigon rice, ordered by various rice merchants in this city from foreign firms such as British firm Dafu Tailong Heyi, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on two Norwegian ships. After import, they were sent to the Zhonghua Wharf opposite Xuejia Wharf to unload, preparing to be sold after the market opens next year. Because new goods of various gangs, guest glutinous rice, and foreign rice have been transported to Shanghai, and the inventory is crowded, the market price has fallen by two or three cents every day. According to observations in the rice industry market, there is hope for a rebound after the market opens in the new spring.</p>

<p>In January of next year, he will participate in a long-distance race from France to Annam. It is hoped that Mr. Cao will win glory for our country and win the championship. Mr. Cao's expenses for studying abroad have reached more than 50,000 yuan. In addition to a subsidy of 3,000 yuan from the Hunan Provincial Government, he has been self-supporting. Recently, due to the high cost of living in France and the high expenses of aviation training, it is difficult to support himself. It is hoped that the government will provide assistance to this talented individual who can benefit the world, so that he can achieve great things.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Updates on the Emergency Relief Efforts <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Emergency Relief Donation Association has been working diligently day and night for a month since its establishment, and is still working as usual even on Sundays. Because the schools are on vacation, only Zhuangjing Primary School has submitted donations and receipt stubs, totaling one yuan in silver dollars and thirty-five cents in small silver coins. The worker's general donations are entrusted to the Shanghai Bank for collection, but they are also temporarily suspended for one day due to the bank's holiday.</p>
<p>The Emergency Relief Donation Association previously sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce regarding the general donations from various trade associations in the business community, requesting the Chamber of Commerce to handle the matter. The Chamber of Commerce specifically instructed various trade associations to raise funds quickly. Recently, various trade associations have submitted the completed donations to the Emergency Relief Donation Association in large numbers. Furthermore, the Fire Engine Cotton Industry Association sent a letter to the Association, claiming to be philanthropists who are always concerned about disaster relief, but will follow the instructions of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce in all actions, regarding the Association as a mixed organization, and requesting that the Association not solicit general donations in the future. After receiving the letter, the Emergency Relief Donation Association believed that the Association's wording was inappropriate and explained that the Association was formed by Party, government, and military organs and various organizations throughout the city to be responsible for raising funds for emergency relief in disaster areas. Why is it being called a mixed organization? Furthermore, the general donations from various trade associations have already been notified by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for compliance, but the Association has not implemented them and still claims to follow the instructions of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce in all actions, which is contradictory. This year's disasters in various places are severe, and all citizens should reduce their spending and enthusiastically donate to help those in need. It is hoped that the Association will adhere to the principle that saving people in disasters is saving people and saving people is saving themselves, and make efforts to solicit donations.</p>
<p>Since the commencement of the household donation campaign, it has been greatly supported by the residents who enthusiastically donate, and the results have been good. Although it was raining heavily yesterday, personnel were still dispatched to carry publicity materials and promote and solicit donations from house to house.</p>

<p>Langxi County in southern Anhui has been suffering from drought for years, and bandits are rampant. Furthermore, this year's autumn harvest only yielded more than 200,000 piculs, leaving approximately 120,000 people without food. In all four directions, people are eating wild vegetables and sweet potato vines every day, and they are now running out. People are abandoning their children on the streets and sitting and waiting to die, which is heartbreaking. In addition, the Anhui government is pressing for grain very urgently, and the people cannot bear it. Therefore, representatives Zhang Shanzi, Wu Liutang, Xie Yutian, and Wang Zongde were publicly elected to appeal to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Relief Committee in the capital. They have been granted permission by the Anhui Province to reduce financial levies and have gone to Shanghai to visit the Drought Relief Committee, earnestly requesting that relief be released early to save the disaster-stricken people.</p>

Before being reassigned, the ship was overhauled at the local Rui Rong factory, adding a large number of passenger seats and adding first, second, and third class cabins. The interior decoration of the ship has been completely renovated, making it magnificent and outstandingly beautiful. At the same time, the service and reception have been improved, and special attention has been paid to the food for the passengers.

<p>Shanghai Mental Hospital is the first of its kind in Shanghai. It has achieved remarkable results and is highly regarded. The original ward on Guling Road was insufficient, so a branch was added on Kangnuo Road to provide widespread relief. Treating and managing such patients in the hospital is quite difficult, but fortunately, the hospital is well-equipped and the nurses are dedicated, which puts the patients' families at ease. Prescriptions and medications are also carefully considered. Recently, Feng Guoxing from Guangdong, Wang Cheng from Anhui, Xie Biquan from Hangzhou, and He Xin-zhou from Guazhou, who was sent by the Shanghai Social Bureau, all suffered from severe mental illness but have recovered and been discharged from the hospital. Furthermore, a nameless insane woman was sent by the Gordon Road police station, and a crazy woman named Shen Ruzhen was detained and sent by the Hongkou police station.

<h3 id="e153">Zhenzi Small Money Shop Yuanchang Mingji Closes Down <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Promissory Notes Issued Temporarily Unpaid</p>
<p>The Closure of the Shop Has No Impact on Finance</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reported that Shanghai money shops are divided into four levels: Yuan, Heng, Li, and Zhen. Yuanchang Mingji Money Shop, located at 74 Fujian Road, is a Zhenzi-level shop. It is small in scale, with a total capital of 15,000 yuan. The manager is Chen Shouchao. The address is at the intersection of Fujian Road and Guangdong Road, which is a one-room shop. It is not a member of the Money Industry Association. Although it issues promissory notes, it is actually equivalent to a tobacco and paper shop, exchanging silver coins and buying and selling securities for customers. It announced the suspension of business liquidation a few days ago due to financial difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Overdraft on Promissory Notes <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>It stopped business a few days ago and posted eight characters on the door: "Liquidation of Accounts, Notes Returned to Origin." A Xin Sheng She reporter learned from the shop yesterday that the reason for the financial difficulties and suspension of business liquidation was that the shop's deposits were gradually withdrawn by depositors. To date, the amount is only about 3,000 yuan. The promissory notes issued a few days ago amounted to about 8,000 yuan, which could not be paid temporarily, resulting in an overdraft.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Total Deposits <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The shop's deposits are about 3,000 yuan, but the amount of loans is more than 3,000 yuan. Therefore, after the suspension of business, it was decided to liquidate according to law. After the loans are recovered, they will be returned to the depositors to ensure that the depositors do not suffer losses. Whether the business will resume in the future will depend on the shareholders' agreement. The closure of the shop has no impact on Shanghai's finance.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of winter this year, the weather has been abnormal. Winter has become spring, and the weather is warm. This morning, heavy fog descended along the coast, and one could not see a few feet away. Therefore, for the safety of navigation, the arrival and departure of ships from various shipping companies were suspended yesterday. It is said that they resumed normal operation after the fog cleared in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng She reported that the National People's Credit Bureau, which was ordered to close down at the end of the year, has reached its deadline. It held a general meeting a few days ago and decided to continue operating until the government's settlement plan is announced. The post office has decided to stop delivering mail on its behalf. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e158">General Meeting of Representatives of National Credit Bureaus <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The National People's Credit Bureau held a general meeting at the Credit Industry Association in Nanshi a few days ago. In addition to the seven general representatives from across the country, including Yin Yuantong, Hua Yunjin, Wang Dabao, Zhuang Gentang, Qiu Zhensheng, Ren Shiting, and Pan Wentian, all credit bureaus in Shanghai, such as Quansheng, Furunsong, Rizheng Xingkang, and Zhengdayuan, participated. The chairman reported on the progress, and then the discussion began. The meeting decided: (1) to continue operating until the government's settlement plan is announced; (2) if the General Post Office stops weighing and delivering credit bureau packages, it will resume the old method of delivering them itself; (3) to request the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to submit a request for relief to the central government.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Notice of Business and Request for Relief <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>In addition to notifying all national credit bureaus to follow the resolutions of the general meeting and continue operating as usual, the general representatives of the National People's Credit Bureau have also requested the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to submit a request for relief to the central government. It is now decided that all credit bureaus in Shanghai will operate as usual on the New Year's holidays of January 1st and 2nd, 1935, and will deliver special mail packages to the post office for weighing and delivery on the 3rd as usual. If the post office refuses, it will deliver them itself according to the old method to ensure that the mail is not delayed. The general representatives have also received instructions from the Ministry of Communications, rejecting the request to postpone the suspension of business.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Railway Temporarily Bans the Transport of Cattle Local Beef Panic Occurs <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Price Rises from 14 Yuan to Nearly 20 Yuan</p>
<p>Foreigners Are the Most Affected</p>
<p>Since the discovery of foot-and-mouth disease in local cattle, the Municipal Health Bureau has submitted a request to the Municipal Government to consult the Ministry of Railways and request that the two railway bureaus be instructed to temporarily prohibit the loading of cattle for two weeks. The Health Bureau found that the infected cattle were first discovered at the Maigen Road Station. The cattle were loaded onto the railway from Benniu and Danyang stations. It is now known that the Ministry of Railways has instructed the two railway bureaus to do so. Therefore, there has been a great panic in the local cattle market, and the price of water buffalo meat has risen from 14 yuan to 19.6 yuan per dan, while the price of yellow beef has risen from 18 yuan to 24 yuan. At the same time, the import of cattle by water has also been greatly reduced due to the attention of the port quarantine office. Furthermore, a survey of the local cattle inventory shows that it is definitely not enough for two weeks of demand. As a result of supply falling short of demand, a beef shortage is inevitable. Foreigners who cannot swallow anything but beef are particularly affected.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Case of Selling Land and Excavating Ancestral Graves <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Qian Liangzhou Does Not Know the Names of His Ancestors</p>
<p>But Claims That the Feng Shui Is Bad and Must Be Relocated</p>
<p>Qian Liangzhou, a 47-year-old native of Shanghai who lives in the Qianjia House on Talas Road in the French Concession and works as a vegetable vendor, and Qian Jianwen, a 62-year-old resident of the same house who used to be a local bailiff and now makes a living by farming, share an ancestral grave located in the second map of the 27th Bao of the upper town (i.e., Talas Road), with an area of more than four fen of land. Recently, Jianwen and his two sons, Qian Shunfa and Qian Jizhi, secretly made an agreement to sell the graveyard land to Zhu Zhensheng from Dongting Mountain. Liangzhou learned of this and tried to stop it, but to no avail. He hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting confirmation that the ancestral graveyard base was the common property of all branches of the family and could not be privately moved or sold. After hearing the case, the court ruled that Qian Jianwen should not privately move the jointly owned ancestral grave. However, after the verdict, Qian Jianwen expressed his dissatisfaction and filed an appeal. On the morning of the 5th of this month, he gathered 20 workers at the site and excavated the ancestral grave. Liangzhou learned of this and invited his clansmen Qian Jisheng and Qian Guisheng to stop him, but to no avail. The two sides then went to the Shanzhong Road French Police Station. After reporting the incident, the head of the police ordered Jianwen to make a pledge to stop excavating the graves. However, after leaving the police station, Jianwen continued to supervise the workers in excavating the graves, unearthing the coffins, collecting the bones, and burying them elsewhere. Qian Liangzhou and others then filed another complaint with the police station, requesting that they be detained and investigated. At that time, the police ordered them to file a lawsuit in the court. At this point, Qian Liangzhou, Qian Jisheng, and Qian Guisheng took photos of the excavated graveyard and collected evidence such as coffin fragments and bones. They hired a lawyer to file a self-accusation with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court in accordance with Articles 263, 265, 337, and 356 of the Criminal Law, accusing Qian Jianwen, Qian Shunfa, Qian Jizhi, and the middleman Zhu Zhensheng, Huang Miaojin, of destroying graves, seizing public property, and stealing treasures from the graves, and requesting that they be investigated and dealt with according to law. The court granted the request and once held a hearing. Only Zhu and Huang appeared, while Qian Jianwen and his sons did not report. They were instructed to reschedule the hearing. The details have been briefly reported in the newspaper. The day before yesterday, Judge Qiu Huan-ying summoned them again in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiffs and their lawyers arrived and stated the previous situation. They also brought the coffin fragments and scattered bones wrapped in red paper as evidence. The defendants Qian Jianwen, Zhu Zhensheng, and Huang Miaojin, along with their defense lawyers, appeared, but Qian Shunfa and Qian Jizhi did not. According to Qian Jianwen's statement, the ancestral grave was inherited from my ancestors and contains the remains of the eighth-generation ancestors, with a total of eight coffins. Because the Qian family has been unlucky for many years, with frequent illnesses, a feng shui master was consulted who said that the feng shui of the ancestral grave was bad. Therefore, on the 5th of this month, the grave was moved and buried in the cemetery west of Hongqiao on December 23rd. It was sold to the Zhu family in June for a total price of 6,200 yuan. This graveyard is not the public property of the plaintiffs. The official asked, "What are the names of the ancestors buried in the grave? Who are they to you?" Jianwen stared blankly and could not answer, claiming, "I am illiterate, I don't know. But I have a copy of the inscription on the stone tablet, which I handed over to the lawyer." The official also asked, "Why are your sons Shunfa and Jiji not here today?" He replied, "This matter was my own decision and has nothing to do with my sons. My sons were not at the scene when the grave was moved. Both of my sons have businesses and don't have time to come." The official said, "As a defendant in a lawsuit, you should come to court. You cannot resist and not come. If you do not come without a reason, this court will issue a warrant for your arrest." Jianwen listened to the instructions and said, "I can call my sons to come to court next time." According to Zhu Zhensheng's statement, I bought this land in June for 16,000 yuan. Huang Miaojin was the middleman. I didn't know it was public ancestral property at first. I only saw a tomb on the ground and didn't know how many coffins were buried underground. The middleman Huang Miaojin admitted to being a witness. I was not at the scene when the grave was demolished. The official then asked the plaintiffs what they meant by accusing Zhu Zhensheng and Huang Miaojin. Qian Liangzhou replied, "They knew that this graveyard was public property and colluded to buy and sell it privately. Although Zhu Zhensheng was not at the scene when the grave was excavated, the middleman Huang Miaojin was at the scene helping to remove the boundary stones." At this point, the official, as the defendants were not all present, instructed that the hearing be rescheduled for January 7, 1935, and instructed Qian Jianwen to bring Qian Shunfa and Qian Jiji to court next time. Failure to do so would result in their arrest.</p>

<p>Lu Cuixia Wins</p>
<p>After the death of Zhao Zhixuan, the former manager of Ziyang Temple, a family dispute arose. His son, Zhao Futang, did not recognize his stepmother, Zhao Lu Cuixia, and filed a criminal self-accusation against Zhao Lu for embezzlement in the Second Special Court. Zhao Lu hired lawyer Cai Liucheng to defend her. Recently, the court ruled that she was indeed Zhao Zhixuan's stepmother and dismissed Zhao Futang's self-accusation. Zhao Futang and his daughter-in-law, Zhao Huang, then sued her uncle, Lu Shutang, for theft. Lu Shutang also hired lawyer Cai to defend him and filed a counterclaim for injury. Lu Shutang was acquitted. Zhao Futang and Zhao Huang were jointly sentenced to two months of imprisonment for injuring someone's body, both with a two-year suspended sentence. Zhao Futang also filed a complaint with the French Concession police station accusing his stepmother of theft, but his stepmother was also acquitted. At the same time, Zhao Futang also sued his stepmother in the civil court, requesting the return of the title deeds, etc., but his request was also rejected.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Ke Yinghao Accused of Rent Arrears Suddenly Claims Japanese Nationality <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Intending to Resist Legal Sanctions</p>
<p>Judge Orders Him to Provide Sufficient Proof</p>
<p>Ke Yinghao, a Cantonese, previously rented a house at No. 5 Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, from Liu Yide's rental agency for a monthly rent of 125.87 yuan. Since May of this year, he has delayed paying the rent, accumulating arrears of over eight months, totaling 1,006.96 yuan. After repeated requests were unsuccessful, the rental agency hired lawyer Zhu Sifu to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special District, accusing Ke of rent arrears and demanding full payment. Yesterday, Judge Luo Chongtai of the First Special Court summoned Ke Yinghao in the Seventh Civil Court. When the bailiff served the summons, Ke Yinghao suddenly claimed to be of Japanese nationality and did not appear in court. Lawyer Zhu Sifu immediately stated that the defendant Ke Yinghao is actually Cantonese. He did not declare his Japanese nationality when renting the house. Now that the case has occurred, he suddenly claims to be of Japanese nationality, clearly intending to rely on the power of a foreign national to resist the judgment of our country's laws. However, according to our country's laws, any citizen who renounces citizenship must obtain a renunciation certificate from the Ministry of Interior. Since the defendant claims to be of Japanese nationality, he should be ordered by the court to present the renunciation certificate from the Ministry of Interior and the certificate of Japanese citizenship to prove it. Otherwise, the court should make a judgment according to law. Judge Luo examined the ticket and instructed that the case be rescheduled for trial on January 10th of next year and ordered the defendant to provide sufficient proof of whether he has already renounced his citizenship. The court was then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Newspaper Reporters Association Aids Chongmin Daily Reporter <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Telegraph to Jiangsu Provincial Government Requesting Impartial Investigation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Newspaper Reporters Association, on the 28th of this month, received an urgent letter from the Chongming Chongmin Daily and the New Chongming Review, stating that Lu Ping, the main contributor to the Review, had been illegally detained by Wang Bin, the county magistrate of the county. They requested assistance. The Reporters Association convened a meeting of its standing committee on the 29th and decided to send a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government requesting an impartial investigation. The original telegram is as follows: "To the Honorable Yu, Head of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, Zhenjiang. Our association has received a letter from the Chongming Chongmin Daily and the New Chongming Review, stating that Lu Ping, a reporter for this newspaper and main contributor to the New Chongming Review, has been illegally detained by Wang Bin, the county magistrate of this county, for five days. We request your upholding of justice and providing assistance. We have found that Lu Ping, a reporter for this newspaper, is a man of integrity and chivalry, who has served the press for six or seven years. He is usually forthright and upright, upholds public opinion, and works diligently for the welfare of the local people. He is praised by the villagers. Recently, in view of the corruption in local politics in this county, the rulers sell official titles, engage in bribery and corruption, and plunder the people's wealth without any restraint. Therefore, he published a new type of Chongming Review to eradicate traitors and filth, criticize evil policies, engage in the national rejuvenation movement, and promote the Three Principles of the People. Since its publication, it has been well received by society. However, it was resented by County Magistrate Wang Bin and his henchmen, who often thought of destroying it, but could not find an excuse. On the morning of the 19th of this month, Lu Ping heard that the provincial government ordered the Nantong Commissioner's Office to instruct the county government to detain Zhang Ji, the former chief of the general affairs section, and Zhao Chengxin, the chief of the investigation section, of the county's anti-smoking committee, who were colluding in corruption, and send them to the province. Zhang Ji, fearing punishment, fled. He then interviewed Wang Bin, the county magistrate, who was also the chairman of the anti-smoking committee, and asked if the news was true. Wang Bin used this news to spread it to the outside world, making it difficult to escape suspicion of being involved in the same wrongdoing. He falsely accused the article 'Novel Commemorative Week' in the New Chongming Review of insulting administrative officials and detained Lu to silence him. He was initially detained in the political police office for six hours before the court opened and Wang personally interrogated him. In the name of interrogation, he only asked about his name, age, and other things, and then sent him to the detention center without saying a word. It has been five days. Wang Bin is using his power to illegally detain a sacred newspaper reporter out of personal grudges, treating the law as waste paper and disregarding public reason. Under the central government's clear order to protect the safety of newspaper reporters, how can we tolerate this county magistrate who disregards the law and acts recklessly in broad daylight? Lu Ping is innocent and has been unjustly imprisoned. He is in prison and lacks the power and influence to defend himself. In order to save the unfortunate Lu Ping and to fight for the freedom of newspaper reporters, we have to ask your association to uphold justice and provide assistance. Not only will Lu Ping be grateful, but our press will also be fortunate," etc. It is clearly stipulated in the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage that the people's freedom of speech and personal freedom should be protected. Whether the case of Chongming County Magistrate detaining Lu Ping involves illegal acts of resentment, we request your office to investigate the matter thoroughly and handle it impartially in accordance with the law. This is our hope. Shanghai Newspaper Reporters Association, respectfully, 30th Seal."</p>

<p>Students Are at the Forefront of the National Goods Year</p>
<p>Shiye News reports: Since its establishment, the National Soul Kneeling Petition Group, organized by patriotic youths Wang Hanchun and others in this city, has been working extremely hard on kneeling petitions. People from all walks of life, feeling the patriotic sincerity of the group members, expressed their sympathy. Even those who accidentally purchased foreign goods would immediately repent after being knelt to by the group. Yesterday, Wang and other members of the group met three university students near the Dananmen on Zhonghua Road. They were all wearing wool uniforms, and one of them held several books of foreign paper stationery. Wang, seeing them approaching, immediately shouted, "Are you Chinese or foreigners?" They were stunned when they heard this. Wang then stepped forward and knelt down, saying, "You are the masters of the country, and you bear a great responsibility. How can you wear foreign wool and write on foreign paper stationery? Isn't that even more heartbreaking? Now I (Wang referring to himself) sincerely persuade you to use national goods and save the country together." They were greatly ashamed when they heard this, expressed their repentance, and tore up the stationery to show their determination. Wang was satisfied and returned.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I recently read an article in the news column of your newspaper on the 28th, titled "Police Chief Opens Fire Out of Grudge," the facts of which are completely fabricated. I, the undersigned, only started working at the Yangjiadu Police Station after the January 28th Incident. At that time, the shop owner, Gong Jinlin, was insane and selling enemy goods. I advised him with righteous words, but he retorted with arrogance and was shameless. Then he received a large batch of small goods, which were investigated by the River and Sea Customs' Ship Management Office's Water Patrol Police, who seized the loot, causing him to hate me to the bone and intend to frame me. On the afternoon of the 27th, the local court summoned us for a clear confrontation. The prosecutor refuted Gong Jinlin's fabrication on the spot. The previous report damaged my reputation. I am writing to you specifically to request a correction. Sincerely, Wu Tianzhi, 158 Yangjiadu, Pudong, December 30th.</p>

<h3 id="e176">The Most Tragic Year for This Newspaper <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Tingchen</p>
<p>Since Mr. Shi Liangcai took over this newspaper in the first year of the Republic of China, after more than 20 years of hard work and the unremitting efforts of colleagues, it has reached its current position. I have always been comforted by this, following my colleagues. Unexpectedly, this year, not long after the New Year, an unfortunate incident occurred. On February 26th, Mr. Qin Liqi, the English translator, died of stomach illness in his Shanghai residence. Colleagues deeply mourned Qin's loyalty to his duties and his overwork. Unexpectedly, after just over 60 days, his wife, Ms. Gong Yinxia, and her daughters, Xisun, eldest son Duan, and second son Jue, all took medicine at midnight on May 5th. The next morning, they followed Mr. Qin to the underworld, and the whole family died for righteousness. Opinion was divided among contemporary commentators, but all the colleagues of this newspaper could not help but shed tears of sympathy. The museum sent staff to manage the funeral and hired Mr. Zhang Yunhe to go to Xichang to pay his respects and discuss funeral matters with Mr. Pingfu, Qin's elderly father. See Mr. Yunhe's "Visiting Friends in Xichang" in the June 1st Free Talk. This is a tragedy. This year, there was a severe drought in the summer and the weather was extremely hot. The highest temperature reached 104 degrees, breaking the Observatory's 60-year record. Colleagues were celebrating their good fortune and safe passage, but on October 23rd, Mr. Hu Juru, the accountant, suddenly died of a minor illness. Mr. Hu was just over sixty years old. Although he was physically weak, he was gentle in nature and had a comfortable family background. If there had been no unexpected stimulation, he would have been able to live out his natural life. Unfortunately, he had a son in his later years, who suddenly died of illness. His wife cried excessively and soon died. She was pregnant at the time of death. Mr. Hu, in addition to mourning the loss of his son, also composed elegies for his deceased wife. He was suffering from illness and died suddenly the day after his wife's funeral. Mr. Hu's family of four deaths is different from Mr. Qin's family of five deaths, but the tragedy is the same. This is another tragedy. Mr. Hu passed away when Mr. Shi had gone to Hangzhou for recuperation. When the obituary arrived in Hangzhou, he immediately sent a letter to Mr. Yunhe, saying, "Another old friend of Shenbao has become weaker." The implication was that he could not help but sigh. Unexpectedly, two weeks later, like a bolt from the blue, suddenly and unexpectedly, Mr. Shi was murdered by bandits on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway at 2:00 p.m. on November 13th. At 6:00 p.m., the police report arrived at the museum. Colleagues were shocked when they heard the bad news and suspected that the messenger was lying. After confirmation, the tragic situation at that time left a deep impression forever. After the shock calmed down, the staff of this museum and the Shi family made some arrangements and rushed to Hangzhou overnight to meet the remains. They arrived at the mansion the next afternoon. The coffin was placed on the 16th. The entire staff of this newspaper held a memorial service at the Lake Society on December 8th. 491 people attended. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely solemn. This is the unprecedented tragedy since the founding of this newspaper. In the past ten years, colleagues of this newspaper have died one after another. Recalling the past, the book and sword drifted away, and their voices and appearances are still there. Thinking of the old grass, there is endless sorrow. For example, Mr. Pei Guoxiong died of typhoid fever, Mr. Dai Yisun died of consumptive disease, Mr. Xie Jiezi died of peritonitis, and Mr. Kang Tongyi died of pneumonia. When they died, I always wrote about their illnesses and their deeds and published them in the newspaper. Every time I wrote, I was always moved to tears. Whenever I thought of orphans and widows, I could not help but sigh. However, the above gentlemen mostly died of illness, and there were several years between them. There has never been a year like this year, one after another, in addition to dying of illness, there are also those who committed suicide and were killed. "Life has come to this, how can the heavens be discussed? I hate people, and I am terrified." When I read Jiang Wentong's Hate Fu, I could not help but put down my book and sigh. I am writing this here, and there is another painful thing that I must attach and write to express my worries. In the second year of the Xuantong era, I left the Zhongwai Daily. In the third year of the Xuantong era, Mr. He Caitang introduced me to Mr. Dong Xipei, the former East seat of this newspaper. Later, I was not abandoned by Mr. Shi and continued to serve until now for more than 20 years. However, Mr. He died of lung disease on November 3rd, ten days before Mr. Shi, and returned to the mountains. (For Mr. He's deeds, see the December 10th Three Groups Memorial Service article in this newspaper.) Within a year, relatives and friends withered away. I mourned the old friends and cried for my personal relatives. How can I not be sad? In the past, Xiang Xiu thought about the past and Lu Ji lamented the passing of time. Even the thatched hut had old friends visiting and exclaiming, and sad poems. Who has no feelings? Who can get rid of this? Especially when I have personally experienced it. How many times have I seen the destruction of sesame trees? How can I dare to sigh for orchids? I also just express my sorrow.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Hearing the words, she covers her tears and sells herself to tell of her bitterness; carefully spying, she presents an invitation card with ardent affection.</p>
<p>Jia Duocai said, "The matter of taking a concubine, what is the rush? It's just that, I just chased them away, I'm afraid they'll be offended." Li Shilian smiled and said, "If it's for this matter, then it's easy to handle. Just now I saw them go to the tea room, Little Ji's place. Maybe they haven't left yet. I'll go and mention it to them and let them come back." Jia Duocai smiled and cupped his hands twice, saying, "I wouldn't dare, and this matter can't be decided in just a few words. We should take our time. If we rush, I'm afraid they'll be pretentious." Li Shilian was seeking his help, so he naturally didn't dare to disobey his wishes. Upon hearing this, he immediately changed his attitude, stopped moving, and smiled at him, "That's fine too. We'll talk about it in a couple of days. You can't indulge women too much. Once you do, they'll put on airs." Jia Duocai, hearing this, felt awkward. He first took a puff of a cigarette, then tilted his head slightly and thought for a while. He supported the cigarette with one hand and touched his cheek with the other, swayed his body twice, and smiled, "If they haven't left, maybe they're waiting for my reply. If I don't give them a reply, they won't know how long to wait. How about... asking the tea room attendant to check on the situation?" Li Shilian smiled and said, "That's not appropriate. The tea room attendants are all in cahoots with them. They'll tell you whatever you want to hear. You can't get any real information that way. I should go." Jia Duocai then smiled and patted his shoulder, saying, "It's good for you to go. Please handle the matter well. If you have the chance, you might as well negotiate with them." Li Shilian patted his chest and said, "Leave the matter to me. I will definitely convince them." But since you are taking a concubine, Brother Jia, this is a matter of enjoyment. You always have to spend some money for happiness. If they have some small requests, you might as well accommodate them a little. Besides, someone like Brother Jia in the banking industry wouldn't care about that." As he said this, he also raised his hand and patted Jia Duocai's shoulder. Only then did he walk towards the backyard with a smile. He saw through Jia Duocai's attitude. He was determined to marry this girl. If he succeeded as a matchmaker and pleased him, perhaps he would repay this kindness and find a good opportunity for me. (103)</p>
<h3 id="e180">Painted Faces <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Wubian</p>
<p>"Painted faces" are a specialized art of actors. Actors put in painstaking effort and go through elaborate procedures for the skill of painting faces. They follow the script and never neglect it because whether the painted face is realistic or not is closely related to the atmosphere of the performance and gaining the audience's emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. For example, in the stage, with one look you know the wicked and treacherous, the loyal and virtuous. At the same time, to show sympathy and resonance, the painted face accounts for a large part of the power to reveal. Therefore, those learning to be actors, no old master withholds the teaching of the "face painting manual" and the actors do not fail to learn it.</p>
<p>In fact, "painted faces" is no longer an exclusive art or unique skill of actors. In this society, all ordinary humans, especially the extraordinary people, have this set of artistic skills. However, actors’ painted faces have the guidance of an old master, are based on a face painting manual, and are touched up with colors. Therefore, this kind of painted face is dead, a stereotypical version. Unlike the painted faces of ordinary and extraordinary people, which are alive and adaptable. Because the painted faces of us ordinary and extraordinary people have no guidance from an old master, nor a face painting manual as a basis, we rely entirely on our ability to make inferences and comprehend. Therefore, we do not need to use colors to touch up, and what is expressed and revealed is often more powerful and effective than those touched up with colors. The painted face of an ordinary person is naturally more ordinary in power and effect. However, extraordinary people who paint extraordinary faces must go through a stage of ordinary people painting ordinary faces. In other words, one must first be an ordinary person painting an ordinary face before one can reach the point of an extraordinary person painting an extraordinary face. However, this is not for those who are stupid or dull-witted.</p>
<p>In this society, it can truly be said that the use of painted faces is great. Let me give you a rough idea: all high officials and nobles, Western-style houses and cars, gold and beauties, as well as all kinds of pleasant titles such as "master" can be exchanged for the face that is painted. For example, when you see a ×× and a beggar at the same time, why do you respect the ×× but despise the beggar? It is because the ×× can paint faces, but the beggar cannot.</p>
<p>The use of "painted faces" is great indeed in this society.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Morning at the Bund Park <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Yunshang</p>
<p>Occasionally, one morning, I woke up early while it was still somewhat dark and hurriedly stepped into the Bund Park along the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>At this time, not only could you not encounter any tourists in the park, but even the little birds in the trees were still sound asleep. The rows of old trees on the pavement had all lost their leaves, and the outstretched branches appeared very thin and weak. The chrysanthemums had long been taken away by the winter wind, leaving only a patch of withered yellow grass still wearing the dew from last night, emitting patches of sparkling light. The Huangpu River was quiet, and the river surface was covered in a mist like light smoke. Looking out, you could not distinguish between the water and the sky, and with a few small steamboats vaguely wriggling in the thick fog, it was even more like a traditional ink painting.</p>
<p>Before long, the scenery suddenly changed. The large morning sun, draped in a red robe, shone with ten thousand rays of light, revealing half of its face in the eastern corner. Those ten thousand rays of golden light scattered the smoke and mist covering the Jiangnan region, and the river water instantly glowed. All the houses, factory chimneys, and forests across the river appeared in clear outline. And looking back at the Bund Garden, it was also dotted with light. A seagull, carrying the sunlight faster than an arrow, skimmed across the river surface, just like the poet praised: "How beautiful! The morning of life, how joyous! The morning of life." The feeling made one receive the morning sun's infinite grace.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to wake up from a deep sleep. The lonely air suddenly became very lively. The whistles of the small steamboats on the Huangpu River were calling, and the wheels of the trams on the road were also calling. The little birds in the trees were singing even more sweetly and movingly. Amidst the calls, many tourists had already come in one after another, some strolling, some practicing boxing, some taking deep breaths. They were probably all "hygienists," right?</p>
<p>At this time, the Bund Park was very lively.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Shooting Range</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager's purpose in visiting the east this time was primarily to tour the scenic spots and historical sites in and around Fengtian City, with no political implications whatsoever. Therefore, after visiting the Fox Immortal Pagoda, she also decided to visit the shooting range where the rulers of the Qing Dynasty used to practice archery and horsemanship before entering the pass. (The so-called shooting range is also a hunting ground. However, according to numerous inquiries by the translator, this shooting range should be in Dongling, Fengtian, and the area is very small, which is different from what is said here. Other than that, there are no fixed hunting grounds in Fengtian! So, the plot described in this chapter is probably fabricated by the author herself; however, some of the anecdotes are indeed true.) The location of this shooting range was about northwest of Fengtian City. The journey from the Shengjing Palace was very long, and it would take a lot of time to get there by sedan chair. Its area was very vast, about ten or twenty li square. Half of it was forest, and the trees in the forest were mostly tall, evergreen trees, so the shade was extremely dense. In the mountainous areas around Fengtian, such large forests were not uncommon and could be seen almost everywhere: unlike in the provinces of the Central Plains, where larger trees were cut down for fuel, and it was no longer possible to form any forests.</p>
<p>The history of this shooting range is indeed extremely long! Before the strength of our Manchu part of the Chinese nation had become strong, that is, before unifying China, when it was just a remote border tribe, it already existed importantly. (213)</p>

<h3 id="e186">Common Knowledge of Winter Clothes <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>From a health perspective, coarse but soft cotton fabrics are most suitable for underwear (shirts), but this varies depending on the season and climate. Now that winter has arrived, one should understand the basic knowledge of clothing, that is, what is the nature of the material of the clothes worn, and what is its relationship with the body? The texture of ordinary clothes is divided into two types: planar warp and weft elasticity, and three-dimensional thick elasticity. Three-dimensional thick elasticity is compressive elasticity, and its texture's insulation and air content are closely related. However, there are differences due to the elasticity of the fibers themselves, the texture of the structure, and the direction in which the fibers and threads run. Wool, camel hair, and other woolen fabrics are rich in insulation, while linen and silk have very little. Therefore, summer clothes are made of linen and winter clothes are made of fur. However, within the same raw material, those with coarse textures and woven-like appearances, whose lines run in a more angular direction on the surface of the texture, or are fluffy, and those with fluff, are richer in compressive elasticity. Now, carefully investigating the texture of clothing, very little air is left in the gaps inside. Even if woven with a very dense method, the air content is mostly above 40%, and usually between 6% and 8%. Extremely coarse and fluffy flannel contains 90% air, so materials with compressive elasticity must have a lot of air content. When our bodies reach winter, because the temperature of the outside air is lower than the body temperature, the body temperature is taken away by the outside air, and we feel cold. If the air temperature drops to 15 degrees, our hands and feet will freeze. At this time, measuring the temperature inside the clothes with a thermometer, the body temperature is 36.5 degrees, the surface of woolen underwear is 28.5 degrees, and the surface of outerwear is 19.4 degrees. Therefore, wearing more clothes in winter gradually changes the temperature, with outerwear being lower than mid-layers, and mid-layers being lower than underwear. The insulating material of underwear has a great relationship with skin temperature. Why? Originally, the clothes we wear do not have warmth themselves, but are warmed by the air held within the clothes. Clothes are like the walls of a house. Underwear with wide collars and sleeves easily loses skin temperature. Therefore, the most important thing for winter underwear is to be close to the skin, have little heat transfer, and have little air permeability, making it difficult to dissipate temperature. It is best to wear thermal underwear, flannel underwear, and woolen sweaters for insulation. Among heat-transferring materials, ramie and silk are the greatest, while wool and flannel are the least. However, being too close to the skin is very unhygienic. Why? Our skin constantly releases water vapor and carbon dioxide. If it is too close, it will cause obstacles and prevent the activity of bodily functions. Wearing wool, flannel, silk, and fur clothes in winter, because they are very rich in air content, allows body temperature to be slowly dissipated, and the air content inside the clothes has moisture, which has an insulating effect. This moisture absorbs moisture. Ramie and silk absorb moisture quickly and release moisture quickly, so they also quickly take away body temperature. Woolen fabrics and fur are the opposite, which is the principle of summer linen and winter fur. Recently, in cities, one often sees ignorant fools who lack common sense and think they are modern wearing silk as winter underwear to show off their wealth, but in fact, they are despised for exposing their lack of common knowledge about clothing. Furthermore, the raw materials of clothing textures, as mentioned above, must have rich air content, little air permeability, and moisture. However, the fiber type of the raw material, the weaving method, and the thickness of the weave are very important. Materials woven with fibers in a smooth direction are most prone to heat transfer and air permeability. Coarse-woven fabrics (such as gauze sold in pharmacies) are suitable for making underwear because they have compressive elasticity and can insulate.</p>

<h3 id="e193">New House Completed at Qingdao National Arts Hall ▲ Ceremony and Performance of National Arts Held ▲ Shen Honglie Visited and Gave a Speech <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Newsletter, Qingdao National Arts Hall was established in the Republic of China in 18. Through the promotion of successive authorities, it has achieved today's achievements. There are as many as 95 National Arts practice centers in the city, with more than 5,000 practitioners. A total of more than 3,000 people have graduated. Recently, a women's practice center has been established to provide equal development opportunities for men and women's national arts. With this gradual promotion, there will be considerable progress in a few years. Mayor and National Arts Hall Director Shen Honglie, due to the lack of a location for the National Arts Hall, had many inconveniences in its implementation. Therefore, he allocated a government-owned land on Guangdong Road to build the National Arts Hall in the spring of this year. It was completed this winter, requiring a total of more than 16,000 yuan for construction costs and internal installation costs. In addition to Mayor Shen's donation of 3,000 yuan, the rest was donated by all sectors of society. On the morning of the 23rd of this month at 9:00 AM, a ceremony was held to celebrate the completion of the new house. Mayor Shen and representatives from various organizations attended, totaling hundreds of people. Mayor Shen presided over the ceremony, and then the secretary of the hall, Xiang Zongding, reported on the evolution of the National Arts Hall. Mayor Shen then delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Li Xianliang, a member of the city party. The performance of national arts then began, and the ceremony was completed and dismissed after 12:00 noon. The secretary's report and Mayor Shen's speech are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e194">▲ History of the National Arts Hall <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Briefly stated, this hall was established in the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929]. Initially, it used the reception room of Yuying Primary School as a temporary office. Later, it moved to Ling County Road, and then to Shanghe Road. All these moves were due to the small size of the premises, which hindered development. At first, one instructor class was set up, with a half-year graduation period. Subsequently, practice classes were recruited, which were of a mobile nature. From the 19th year [1930] onwards, practice centers were gradually established and expanded, now reaching as many as 95. Currently, about 2,000 people are practicing in these centers, and about 3,000 have graduated. That year, a wrestling class was also established, because wrestling has equal value to boxing. Wrestling in this city was very rudimentary, and there was indeed a need to promote it. Approximately 300 people have graduated so far. In addition, the issue of examining and certifying national arts education is also extremely important. In October of the 21st year [1932], the first examination was held, with 82 people passing. In December of the 22nd year [1933], the second examination was held, with 103 people passing. Furthermore, in June of the 20th year [1931], in accordance with the regulations of the Central National Arts Hall, the first city examination was held, selecting 14 martial artists. In July of the 21st year [1932], the second city examination was held, selecting 15 martial artists. Regarding the hall's participation in various sports meets, in the 19th year [1930], representatives were sent to Hangzhou to participate in the national arts examination. In the same year, a national arts competition was held in Shanghai, and the hall also sent personnel to participate. In the 21st year [1932], the 16th North China Games were held in Henan, and the hall sent four representatives to participate. In the 22nd year [1933], the 17th North China Games were held in Qingdao, along with the National Games of the same year, and this year's 18th North China Games, all achieving good results and winning the 18th championship. Regarding the hall's finances, when it was first established, the municipal government subsidized 300 yuan per month, which was very tight at the time. In the 20th year [1931], it was increased to 500 yuan per month, but it was still not enough to cover expenses. In the 22nd year [1933], Mayor Shen approved an increase to 600 yuan per month. Since July of last year, the municipal government has increased the hall's funding, allocating 300 yuan every three months for rewarding the various practice centers. The practice centers are inspected once every three months, with the best being rewarded and the worst being shut down. Last year, the municipal government also requested a temporary allocation of 1,000 yuan, and the hall's colleagues donated 100 yuan to buy 500 broadswords and manufacture other weapons. Moreover, physical education for both men and women is equally important. A women's practice class was established in July of last year, with more than 30 people. Recently, a women's practice center was established and has already begun recruiting students, aiming to simultaneously advance national arts for both men and women. This is the general situation of the hall since its establishment. Recalling the simplicity of the past, now residing in this magnificent building, there has indeed been progress compared to the past. However, this is only a superficial matter. As for national arts itself, how to promote it, how to expand it, the hall's colleagues will naturally follow the mayor's intentions and the guidance of all sectors to strive forward.</p>
<h3 id="e195">▲ Admonition by Shen Honglie <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Briefly stated, the municipal national arts hall has indeed made progress in the past five years, with significant improvements in both knowledge and skills. However, amidst this joy, I feel a sense of crisis, because the municipal national arts hall has dominated various sports meets, winning too many championships. The 18th North China Games almost became a monopoly for our city, and I fear that this will lead to arrogance and a decline in skills. This is the danger that I feel. We should not be arrogant, nor should we be discouraged. Only by constantly striving can we make progress. I would like to take this opportunity to explain the goals for promoting physical education, which can be divided into three categories: (1) Popularization: Whether it be organizations, schools, or the public, everyone should have physical education, and physical education should be rationalized. New physical education and old physical education should be integrated. Whether it be Boy Scouts, military training, ball games, or track and field events, they should all be made into rationalized physical education. Therefore, the implementation methods should not make physical education a temporary subject but should make it a required course. Standards have already been drafted and will definitely be implemented in the future. All organizations, groups, and factories should organize various sports teams, such as basketball teams, volleyball teams, or national arts teams. After forming these teams, they should compete frequently to promote progress. As for the public, various sports should be added to the people's schools so that everyone has the opportunity to practice. By doing so, popularization can be gradually achieved. (2) Excellence: Schools and groups should be made to compete frequently, and then excellent individuals should be selected from each group and trained, which will surely lead to good results. (3) Unity: Whether it be track and field, ball games, boxing, wrestling, military training, Boy Scout training, or even skating, horse racing, kite flying, and shuttlecock kicking, they should all be integrated. Techniques should be practiced interdependently, without distinction between fields, so that an entire group can be formed. Only by striving to implement these three things can we truly promote physical education and naturally cultivate healthy citizens. As for championships, they are merely matters for after-dinner conversation. We do not hope for them. This is my general policy for promoting physical education.</p>

Mr. Zhou Dagang, a teacher at the school, raised the issue of cooperation in education between the school and the family, and Mr. Jiang Dixian gave a lecture on methods of agricultural improvement. The villagers were very understanding and happy to receive guidance. The Gui Lane Cooperative Education Society recently organized a sales cooperative, which has been established.

<p>— Lecture by Wang Qizhang, Notes by Chen Sheng Bai and Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>Current Chinese Medical Education</p>
<p>In today's society, are there people who understand clearly and study foreign knowledge? Probably seven or eight out of ten still adhere to the existing traditional Chinese medicine, thinking there is no need to learn foreign medicine. It is truly not easy to find someone who is truly determined to use foreign scientific medicine to assimilate China's inherent medicine. Therefore, to this day, approximately two-thirds of the scientific medical education institutions were founded by foreigners or are subsidized by foreign forces. This kind of non-automatic, unconscious cultural import is simply an invaded colonial education - alienated education; rather than an automatic, autonomous national education - assimilated education.</p>
<p>Look at the United States in the Philippines; everything is Americanized. On the surface, the Philippines will become the second America and become a great and strong country in the world. Unfortunately, the American education received by the Philippines is enslaving education, colonial education, and has only formed a base for the United States in East Asia! Similarly, Annam is Frenchified, and Taiwan and Korea are Japanized. We know that if you want people to educate you, if you want people to help you, people are willing to sacrifice; as long as the person willing to sacrifice is not a fool, I dare say that those people must have intentions, either to fight for power or to seek profit. There is definitely no true sacrifice without a second thought. Perhaps I am saying this too aggressively.</p>
<p>There are many such examples, such as the schools in the Shanghai concessions. The talents they have cultivated cannot be said to be few; however, they are of no benefit to China, and even harmful. The people who come from there cannot do business for China, they can only be compradors for foreign firms, clerks in offices, translators in patrol rooms, and do work of assisting the wicked. We see foreigners taking Chinese money to educate Chinese children. Can we say that they are unwilling to sacrifice? In fact, their intentions are for themselves, not for us Chinese. Therefore, all Chinese people should know that this is not educating citizens for China, but rather providing many citizens to others. Some people say: academics are academics, politics are politics, this is fundamentally wrong. However, there are direct and indirect relationships between academics and politics, but academics and politics cannot be separated. For example, a scientist invents something. Of course, this is a so-called academic contribution, but after his invention, it gives the country tremendous help in terms of economy and politics. Look: the progress of chemistry will lead to the occurrence of chemical warfare; the progress of machinery will lead to the appearance of tanks and mortars. If this kind of weapon is used for me, it can protect the country. If used for others, it can destroy the country. A moment's reflection will make it clear: people educate you, sacrifice for you, spend effort for you, and spend money for you, just to cultivate a group of willing dogs. Will this group of dogs understand national principles? Will they understand their position clearly? What is the background of the great and solemn League of Nations? What is its role? A discerning person can of course see through its dark secrets. So I think that the medical education in China today still relies on the education of others. It is still tending towards alienation, and the future is very dangerous. For example, those who like England and the United States are single-mindedly trying to turn China into England and the United States, those who like France are trying to turn China into France, and perhaps those who like Germany and Japan are trying to turn China into Germany and Japan... If one day their respective desires are satisfied, China will no longer be China, but will have become a foreign China.</p>
<p>V. Future of Medical Education in China</p>
<p>Since we feel that our level is not enough, and at the same time we feel that simply imitating others is not thorough enough, then how should we deal with the medical education problem in the future? Because our knowledge is immature, of course we cannot but learn their foreign knowledge. If we cannot recognize their characters, then we cannot understand the content of their scholarship. We must recognize clearly that we may as well learn their characters and scholarship, but we want to use it to assimilate, not to alienate. Even if we see that foreign things are better than ours, we like them, admire them, and learn them, and abandon the things that we don't like, all are possible; but we must recognize clearly that we want to learn from it, not just become it. If we also become it, and are alienated by them, then it will be terrible!</p>
<p>(A) Importance of National Education We need to further discuss here how we can avoid alienation?</p>
<p>I think the most important thing is to lay the foundation for national education. If there is no foundation for national education, then you cannot learn foreign scholarship or use foreign things. Because with a foundation of national education, you can avoid foreignization, you can use foreign things to assimilate, you can take foreign scholarship for your own use, and make the country receive great benefits, and even be able to surpass foreign things and promote the national quintessence. Therefore, even if you enter a foreign school and receive foreign education, you will not be foreignized. If a person does not have a good foundation in national education, no matter how studious or intelligent he is, the result is that although his appearance, name, and nationality are Chinese, he is actually foreignized, he is already a foreigner.</p>
<p>Educators have said: "General education is national education, national education has a foundation, and then there is academic education. If there is no national education, there is no academic education."</p>
<p>In the past, there were countless Chinese students studying abroad. The result is that they can only speak a few foreign languages, wear a few foreign suits, use foreign things, be driven by foreigners, and increase economic and political aggression and power for foreign countries. These bad phenomena are all because they have not received good autonomous national education. This is a huge crisis in the future of Chinese academic education!</p>
<p>Therefore, I personally advocate that if Chinese national education has a foundation, then the future of Chinese medical education has hope, and Chinese medical education will be effective; otherwise, Chinese medical education will only get worse and worse, and the future of Chinese medical education is simply unimaginable.</p>
<p>In order to see this clearly, if we follow the current educational policy, I think the Chinese government simply does not need to send students abroad to be foreignized and become foreign teachers for Chinese people; it is better to hire foreigners straightforwardly to teach in China, which can save a lot of trouble and be more effective, right?</p>
<p>(B) Stages for Learning Foreign Culture We can divide learning foreign culture into three stages:</p>
<p>The first stage - learning its appearance, not learning its essence. For example, wearing a Western suit, we can only learn its appearance. The raw materials for the Western suit must still be domestic products, but not foreign products to be alienated by it; if you wear Chinese clothes and use foreign raw materials, the result is also equivalent to alienation. Therefore, when we bring foreign things into China, we only need to take its characters as symbols, not use foreign characters to represent Chinese characters, and treat foreign texts as</p>
<h3 id="e229">Public Health Assistant and the Needs of Society <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Renyuan</p>
<p>The rural hygiene work of Takahashi's Hygiene Office (formerly known as the Takahashi Rural Hygiene Model Area) occupies a considerable position in China's current health undertakings, and there is no need to introduce it further.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the director of the office, Zhang Wei, and the hosts, Dr. Zhu Bangren and Dr. Lai Douyan, in response to the need to popularize health education among the people and the fact that bankrupt farmers cannot afford doctors, took advantage of their ability to learn while doing, and requested the municipal health bureau to approve the establishment of a public health assistant training class. In this day and age, where poverty and disease are rampant and scientific doctors are scarce, the establishment of such training classes in rural areas is necessary for social reform and the future of the nation, and should be vigorously promoted. The following is a miscellaneous record for the reference of those who study China's health undertakings.</p>
<p>This training class is neither the same as the ordinary assistants who change medicine in the outpatient department, nor like a second-rate nurse. The purpose of the training is to have them go to the countryside where people cannot afford doctors and do not necessarily need doctors, to do preventive work, school hygiene, family visits, and health education, so it is called a public health assistant training class.</p>
<p>They were afraid of recruiting the type of young masters and young ladies, whose training would be useless, so the first thing they paid attention to when recruiting was to have a hard-working spirit, preferably young people who grew up in the countryside, because only those who grew up in the countryside know the situation and suffering of the countryside, and will be willing to go back to their hometowns and work hard.</p>
<p>The general situation of the recruitment is that those with junior high school education or equivalent qualifications can enroll. The term is one year, with the first half year being the training period and the second half year being the internship period. During the training period, living expenses are subsidized. If it is sent by an organization, the subsidy is provided by the organization. Because it was the first trial, the recruitment was limited to eight people. Later, many people requested to join, so three more people were added, making a total of eleven, and classes started on January 1st of this year.</p>
<p>The teaching method is to learn and then do, and to seek further practical knowledge from doing things. For example, if you have school hygiene in the morning, you will go to the school in the afternoon to help with physical examinations and train students, and bring back any problems to solve.</p>
<p>The subjects taught are anatomy, physiology, pathology, bacteriology, disinfection, infectious diseases, first aid, pharmacology, disease prevention, bandaging, school hygiene, environmental hygiene, factory hygiene, maternal and child hygiene, social investigation, statistics, nursing, family visits, and applied writing (including ethics, sociology, English, Chinese, and other subjects), teaching them roughly according to the needs of the situation. Because they do not want to treat diseases, they do not teach the subjects related to treatment, except for first aid and the application of ordinary medicines. The rest of the time is spent on field work and discussing problems.</p>
<p>The first half of the year's classes ended at the end of June, and from July 1st, they were assigned to various rural areas for internships according to their interests and strengths, and in this short period of time, they have already achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>If we calmly study it, in this situation where public health is extremely underdeveloped, scientific doctors are scarce and most of them are unwilling to go to the countryside, and farmers cannot find doctors to treat their illnesses, this kind of talent can indeed prevent diseases, reduce the suffering of the villagers, and remedy this transitional period in China. On the other hand, they can also be pioneers in popularizing health education and making people believe in scientific medicine. I think it is very suitable for the needs of the current society.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Reflections on the Detention of Students from the Medical College of Nantong University for Collecting Bone Specimens <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Chou Jiu</p>
<p>The late principal of our school, Mr. Zhang Jian, founded this school more than 20 years ago with the aim of developing industry to run education. In the past, because the standard of living was relatively low and the industrial surplus was rich, the funding was quite abundant, and the equipment could be expanded at any time. In recent years, the standard of living in society has increased several times, and industry has been affected by the bankruptcy of rural areas. Not only is there no surplus, but there is also a deficit, so the regular expenses originally subsidized to our school have to be discounted and paid. The school can only maintain the status quo with difficulty.</p>

<p>Making Chinese culture; we must apply their theories, understand their content, and write them out in Chinese characters to make them become Chinese scholarship. That is what is considered assimilation; otherwise, if we learn from foreigners, we ourselves will also become foreigners. Such alienation is very dangerous.</p>
<p>The second stage || In this stage, we don't need to use foreign languages, we don't need to hire foreign professors, we don't need to use foreign equipment, because we have already learned the foreign methods, obtained their essence, and can use domestic raw materials and domestic talents to create an independent scholarship.</p>
<p>The third stage || Use the assimilated scholarship to do further research, compete with foreign countries, and ask foreign countries to absorb Chinese culture and assimilate it by taking what we have to achieve the purpose of mutual exchange.</p>
<p>Let us try to review our country's medical education: in the past, it was due to foreign aggression that it became a passive medical education. Now, it has not yet broken away from the influence of foreignization, and it is still purely foreign medical science. In this situation, even the first two stages of learning foreign culture mentioned above have not been escaped, and of course, it is impossible to seek medical independence. It can only remain in a very dangerous state of alienation.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of you will be the future leaders of Chinese medicine. What I hope for you is:</p>
<p>(1) The foundation of national education must be laid, and foreign languages must be understood, because this is a prerequisite for a backward country to absorb scholarship.</p>
<p>(2) After absorbing foreign scholarship, we should carefully chew it and make it dissolve, not swallow it whole. I remember that Mr. Tan Zhen, after returning from a study of the judiciary in Europe and the United States, made the following statement: "It is not possible to take other people's laws and apply them to China. We don't have to say that we can't learn them, because we don't necessarily have to be the same as them." I am very sympathetic.</p>
<p>6 Conclusion</p>
<p>China's medical education: In the past || Not worth mentioning! Now || Very dangerous!</p>
<p>In the future || We must recognize the background and role of foreigners, determine our own views, determine the goals of learning foreign culture, and absorb the essence of foreign countries to make it Chinese, not worship foreign culture and become foreignized.</p>
<p>Foreign languages can only be regarded as a sign for learning foreign culture and are not fundamentally related to the future of the entire education. For the sake of the vital issue of Chinese education, especially the future of medical education, we should still focus on the needs of national education. || End ||</p>
<p>It is difficult, how can we talk about expanding equipment? Therefore, the collection of specimens depends entirely on the self-efforts of our students. Medicine attaches great importance to practice, such as anatomy in basic courses. It is not enough to just read books and memorize terms to understand it. We must carry out dissection and see the actual situation to clarify the truth. Nantong was originally a prefecture and county. In the past, there were many executions of robbers and criminals. According to the government's order, the bodies of those without family members could be issued to local medical institutions for dissection and practice. However, the people of Tongdi were not enlightened (perhaps the entire China is like this). In the past, after our hospital received the bodies and carried out dissection, the Tongxian government was criticized. Therefore, in recent years, every time the corpses were executed, even if there were no family members, after repeated contacts with our hospital, the responsible authorities always used clever words to shirk their responsibility. For this reason, what our students rely on as anatomical specimens is only the exposed bones in the desolate tombs and wild graves.</p>
<p>A week ago, students from our hospital picked up bone specimens on the barren tombs of the Animal Husbandry Farm of our school's Agricultural College, but they were not understood by the villagers, who reported to the public security organs. The public security organs also implemented detention and sent them to the court for handling. Fortunately, the court was able to understand the pure purpose of scientific research and gave a lenient treatment. Unexpectedly, not only did the society not explain the misunderstanding, but some fabricated facts, and some made unwarranted criticisms. For the sake of the future of medicine and the happiness of mankind, we cannot but feel deeply pained, and we cannot but make some statements.</p>
<p>Medicine is for treating diseases and saving people. If you want to treat diseases, you should first have an accurate diagnosis. Acupuncture and medicine are secondary. Whether it is diagnosis or treatment, it will not be effective if you do not first understand the structure of our body and its physiological and pathological conditions. Physiological anatomy is to understand the position of the anatomical organs and their organizational structure. Pathological anatomy is to observe the causes of diseases and their changes. Bones are the foundation of physiological anatomy. First, know the structure of the bones, then know the position of the organs, the attachment of muscles and ligaments, and the passage of blood vessels and nerves. From this, further study the mysteries of physiology and pathology, examine the causes of diseases, and treat them. Then it will be easier to see results, just like an engineer with a machine. If you don't first understand the structure of the machine, how can you know the movement and damage of the machine, let alone repair and improve it? This is why Western medicine is called scientific medicine, and it is also the key to the rapid progress of European and American medicine, which our country cannot match.</p>
<p>People often hope that doctors can make accurate diagnoses and reasonable treatments, but they do not understand the doctor's dissection of corpses and collection of bones. How contradictory is this? This is worth noting.</p>
<p>From a philosophical point of view, "death" is the final destination of life. After death, everything cannot be missed, nor does it need to be missed. What about the body? What's the difference between cremation, water burial, bird burial, animal burial, and thick coffins, beautiful clothes, and decorated graves for the dead? It's just to comfort the living. This is worth noting.</p>
<p>I heard that returning birds have the saying that instead of rotting with grass and trees, why not contribute their bodies for the research of the medical community, turn uselessness into usefulness, and seek the development of medicine and the happiness of the people? This is worth noting.</p>
<p>Even if we take a step back and talk about the facts, the barren tomb belongs to the Animal Husbandry Farm of our school's Agricultural College. It lacks family members and is unattended. Usually, white bones are everywhere and trampled by livestock. Why is it inappropriate for us to collect them as specimens? Clever words of charity are even more slippery. This is worth noting.</p>
<p>In short, in this incident, the so-called principal offender (actually, it cannot be called a crime) is worthy of admiration for his spirit of scientific loyalty, and his actions are not inappropriate in any way. The villagers are misled by traditional concepts and superstitious myths and heresies, which is understandable. However, it is really incomprehensible and deeply regrettable that people in the society fabricate their words and criticize them.</p>
<p>In Western countries, the dissection of corpses and the collection of bones have long been commonplace. It is appropriate that their medicine is thriving and making great progress, which our country cannot hope to match.</p>
<p>Since thousands of years ago, China's patriarchal concept has been deeply rooted. Wearing mourning clothes and thick coffins are regarded as major events in human relations. Destroying corpses and harming bodies are regarded as rebellious acts. After a long period of accumulation, it is not easy to reform. However, for the sake of the future of medicine and the happiness of mankind, the author dares to put forward the following suggestions to seek the correction and adoption of people in the society.</p>
<p>(1) The government authorities should quickly formulate and implement concrete regulations to protect and encourage the research on corpse dissection.</p>
<p>(2) The media should always discuss the value of medical dissection from a fair standpoint and correct the corrupt and erroneous views of the public.</p>
<p>(3) Intellectuals should set an example, embrace the spirit of fearlessness, and contribute the corpses of individuals or family members for medical dissection to promote it.</p>
<p>(4) The medical community should unite and strive to urge the government to help the media eliminate the erroneous views of the public, and especially respect the dissected corpses and conduct detailed research to meet the actual situation.</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned points can be fulfilled, fulfilled their responsibilities, and implemented in a practical way, then the accumulated habits can be eliminated, and the future of medicine and the happiness of the people can be truly relied on.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(49) Intestinal Obstruction (Continued)</p>
<p>(Q) In addition to the symptoms mentioned above, what other symptoms are there in strangulated intestinal obstruction?</p>
<p>(A) In addition to eroding the intestinal wall, bacteria can also invade the mesentery. The onset of the disease is mostly sudden, with symptoms of concussion. The pain is very severe, and the entire abdomen is felt. Vomiting is also very severe, occurring one or twenty times a day, mixed with bile, but with little fecal odor and color. The abdominal wall is very tense, but the degree of bloating is slight; and there is local resistance, tenderness, and bulging.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of paralytic intestinal obstruction?</p>
<p>(A) The symptoms are the same as those of obturator intestinal obstruction. The bloating is limited. The pain is caused by the underlying disease. Vomiting is delayed. There is no noise in the intestines.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of spastic intestinal obstruction?</p>
<p>(A) Although it is also similar to obturator intestinal obstruction, there is no vomiting of feces or concussion, the pain is also mild, and the overall condition is relatively good.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the treatment for intestinal obstruction?</p>
<p>(A) Different treatments should be given depending on the condition.</p>
<p>(Q) How should attention be paid to the patient's diet?</p>
<p>(A) For acute obstruction, fasting should be done. For subacute obstruction, a small amount of food that will not accumulate in the intestines, such as milk and milk powder, can be eaten. For chronic stenosis, a small amount of nutritious food without residue can be eaten.</p>
<p>(Q) What kinds of food should be avoided?</p>
<p>(A) The foods and medicines that must be avoided are those that easily cause constipation, such as strong tea, gelatinous food, foods containing lime, and bismuth preparations. There are also foods and drinks that produce gas, such as carbonated drinks and potatoes.</p>
<p>(Q) How should abdominal pain and tension be treated?</p>
<p>(A) A warm compress can be applied to the abdomen.</p>
<p>(Q) What should be done if the patient is very thirsty?</p>
<p>(A) Ice cubes can be held in the mouth, or warm tea can be used to rinse the mouth. Saltwater injection is also effective.</p>
<p>(Q) Can opium be used when there is intestinal peristalsis with pain and vomiting?</p>
<p>(A) It can be used, but it is absolutely forbidden in paralytic intestinal obstruction.</p>
<p>(Q) Is gastric lavage effective?</p>
<p>(A) Gastric lavage is very effective. This can not only reduce the contents that are regurgitated in the intestines, but also eliminate the phenomenon of autointoxication.</p>
<p>(Q) How is electrical therapy performed for this disease?</p>
<p>(A) First, inject 100 cc of physiological saline into the intestines, insert a zhengchang conductor (cathode), and apply zheng stream electricity for 15 minutes (10 to 15 milliamperes). It is most suitable for paralytic abdominal obstruction.</p>
<p>(Q) When is surgical operation necessary?</p>
<p>(A) If treatment is ineffective within 24 hours of the onset of the disease, only surgical laparotomy can be performed. This is especially true for strangulated intestinal obstruction. The earlier the laparotomy, the better. (End)</p>

<p>(5) Specialized Diagnosis || Tuberculin Reaction</p>
<p>The diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis is most accurate and reliable when tubercle bacilli are found in the sputum. This situation has already been discussed above! However, this proof is not easy for every patient to obtain. Even important clinical symptoms such as hemoptysis, cough, increased temperature, and weight loss are sometimes completely lacking, but the result will also determine that he is suffering from this disease. This aspect of the harvest is in addition to the various examinations mentioned above, there is another specialized diagnostic method; this is the tuberculin described now!</p>
<p>What is "tuberculin"? It is made by refining tubercle bacilli and was first invented by the pioneer of bacteriology, Master Koch; hence, it also has the name "tuberculin". Its application in the treatment of this disease is very broad, and there are considerable achievements that can be secretly observed; the details of this will be described in a separate chapter later. In addition, in terms of diagnosis, when the disease starts in the early stage, the clinical symptoms are not obvious, and whether the doctor's decision is correct or not is in doubt. But if the patient is found to have a positive tuberculin reaction, this problem will be solved almost immediately! With a clear understanding of the disease, it is of course possible to start with the right treatment plan as soon as possible! This is a win-win situation, and I don't think anyone will deny the convenience it gives to both the patient and the doctor.</p>
<p>What is the tuberculin reaction like? It is divided into three aspects: local lesions and the whole body. The local reaction refers to the place where tuberculin is inoculated or injected, and swelling and pain will mostly occur. The reaction of the lesion refers to the increase of redness and swelling in the lesion and the presentation of an inflammatory reaction. This is a very obvious example in lupus vulgaris, which is a skin tuberculosis; of course, it cannot be seen in pulmonary tuberculosis. However, clinically, there are also symptoms such as increased cough, increased sputum volume, and increased muddy vesicular sounds. Among the systemic reactions, the most significant proof is the rise in body temperature. Just a rise of half a degree Celsius higher than usual can be regarded as a positive reaction. This rise will usually occur six or eight hours after the injection, reaching its peak after 24 hours (up to 39 or 40 degrees Celsius), and then gradually decrease over two or three days until it returns to the pre-injection state. In addition to the rise in body temperature, symptoms such as headache, restlessness, nausea, and vomiting will mostly occur at the same time. || The discovery of these three positive reactions is usually between seven or eight hours and as late as ten to twelve hours; if it occurs after a few days, we can simply say that it is not related to tuberculin inoculation or injection.</p>

<p>(29) Real Fuli (commonly known as Diphtheria) (Continued)</p>
<p>▲ Prevention of Real Fuli</p>
<p>Since Real Fuli is recognized as an infectious disease caused by Real Fuli bacilli, it must of course follow the general regulations for infectious diseases. Send it to an infectious disease hospital immediately for isolation. However, in fact, it is not always possible. Because sometimes parents are unwilling to send their sick children to the hospital for isolation and treatment, so most of them are isolated at home and seek medical treatment. At this time, it is absolutely impossible to share food and accommodation with the patient, especially for children. The bedroom must always be kept ventilated, and it is better to have direct sunlight exposure. All utensils, toys, and bedrooms should be carefully disinfected with disinfectant solution. It is better to use steam disinfection. Furthermore, oral hygiene is also important. Use sterilized water to rinse your mouth frequently. As for the injection of preventive serum, it must be injected after a doctor's examination. However, because its defensive power disappears after a certain period, most people are often unwilling to inject it.</p>
<p>▲ Treatment of Real Fuli</p>
<p>The only effective treatment for Real Fuli is to inject Real Fuli serum. Whether it is pharyngeal Real Fuli, laryngeal Real Fuli, or nasal Real Fuli, if a definite diagnosis is obtained, Real Fuli serum should be injected immediately. The earlier the injection, the faster the effect. The amount of serum is calculated in units. The number of units depends on the date of onset, the severity of the disease, the age of the patient, and the constitution. Usually, the serum injection unit for laryngeal Real Fuli is always above 10,000. According to our doctors' experience, it is better to err on the side of injecting too many units than too few. Regarding this point, the attending physician can of course consider the situation and inject it as much as possible. You can rest assured. When serum is injected, and later after it is injected, two diseases often occur. These diseases do not necessarily occur with every injection. Now I will briefly describe the phenomena of these two diseases as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Allergy. In people who have been injected with serum a week ago, if a second serum injection is given, there are often severe and terrifying reactions, sometimes even endangering life. (Even if the first serum injection was many years ago, this is still the case.) Fortunately, it is still relatively easy to prevent this terrible allergy. That is, when injecting, a very small amount should be injected first. After half an hour or an hour, if there is no reaction, inject a slightly larger amount, and after another half an hour or an hour, the full amount can be injected. The reason for injecting in stages is because it can preemptively numb the patient's sensitivity. This injection in stages can probably avoid encountering the above-mentioned danger. Now, experienced doctors generally ask if they have been injected with serum before when injecting various serums, or directly implement injections in stages. They are simply trying to prevent this allergy in advance.</p>
<p>(2) Serum sickness. This serum sickness is not specifically found in Real Fuli serum. Other serums can also occur. Its symptoms are that about a week after the serum injection, red, finger-sized, urticaria-like spots often appear from the face, trunk, to the limbs. The itching is severe, which is quite painful. At the same time, the temperature also rises, which often causes fear among patients and their families. In fact, I dare to guarantee that it is harmless, and even more that there is no danger to life. Generally, after three or four days, or up to a week, the fever will drop and the rash will subside, and health will be restored. If laxatives and calcium agents are given, then its recovery date will be even faster.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if laryngeal Real Fuli has fallen into a state of suffocation and there is no time to inject serum, or if serum has been injected but breathing difficulties become more severe, a tracheotomy should be performed immediately to open another airway. Seek urgent breathing to save the day. Often, the suffocating, purplish-blue complexion can be changed to a ruddy color by several smooth breaths, and the dying life can be saved. It is a pity that most families are unwilling to have their children undergo this operation, which is really a pity (End)</p>
<h3 id="e234">A General Description of Malaria (3) <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaolan</p>
<p>▲Malaria Symptoms▼</p>
<p>(1) Tertian and Quartan Malaria: In malaria sufferers, the time from the introduction of malaria parasites into the blood to the onset of the disease is called the incubation period. It is approximately ten to fourteen days for tertian malaria and twelve to twenty-one days for quartan malaria. The tertian malaria parasite matures in forty-eight hours, hence the disease occurs every other day. Repeated infections can cause alternating day fevers, resembling daily malaria. The quartan malaria parasite matures in seventy-two hours, causing fever every three days, commonly known as "fever on both ends of the fourth day." When the fever occurs for two consecutive days with a one-day interval, it is called "repeated quartan malaria." If the fever occurs daily, it is called "triple quartan malaria." If several types of malaria parasites are mixed or repeatedly infected, the chills and fever will occur irregularly, making it difficult to distinguish without blood tests. Although tertian and quartan malaria are mild forms of the disease, if left untreated, they can develop into chronic malaria or induce heart and lung diseases.</p>
<p>During a malaria attack, the body temperature rises sharply, reaching around 40 degrees Celsius. Peripheral blood vessels constrict, reducing blood flow, causing chills and shivering, goosebumps, and chattering teeth. The skin becomes pale and cold, and the lips and fingertips turn blue. This phase lasts an average of one to two hours. Subsequently, as the fever reaches its peak, blood flows to the peripheral blood vessels, causing the skin to become hot and flushed, with a red face and thirst. The spleen becomes congested and enlarged. Auscultation of the heart reveals systolic murmurs associated with the fever. This phase lasts an average of three to four hours. Finally, the body temperature drops, and peripheral blood vessels dilate, causing profuse sweating all over the body. Urine output gradually increases, the spleen shrinks, and the symptoms subside. This phase lasts an average of two to three hours, gradually returning to normal. When the malaria parasites mature and divide again, releasing merozoites into the blood, another attack occurs. However, the timing of the attacks may vary slightly, hence the terms "progressive" or "retrogressive."</p>
<p>In addition to chills and fever, the number of red blood cells and hemoglobin in the blood decreases, leading to anemia. Blood tests can reveal basophilic stippling in red blood cells, as well as an increase in transitional and large mononuclear leukocytes. Patients often experience pain in all bones and joints, or develop creeping eruptions and rose spots. Inflammation of the respiratory tract can cause coughing. During the chill phase, the skin is dry and sensation is dulled, with a rapid and weak pulse and rapid breathing. During the fever and sweating phase, the skin is flushed and sensation is hypersensitive, with a full and rapid pulse. Intermittent pulsus bigeminus may also occur. Neurological symptoms often include headache, neuralgia, convulsions, paralysis, drowsiness, and altered movements. Digestive symptoms often include stomach pain, jaundice, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, belching, and loss of appetite. During the intervals between attacks, the urine often contains urobilin.</p>
<p>(2) Pernicious Malaria: Pernicious malaria is more severe and often leads to severe anemia and malarial cachexia. It occurs more frequently in tropical regions, with an incubation period of approximately five to ten days. After the initial attack, basophilic stippling can be detected in red blood cells. The maturation of the malaria parasites is irregular, causing erratic fevers that may occur daily, every other day, or several times a day. There may be repeated chills and fevers, or no chills and no sweating. The fever may persist for a long time. As such, there are terms like "tropical daily fever," "midday malaria," and "summer-autumn fever." Because it often presents with symptoms like lethargy, drowsiness, delirium, mania, convulsions, paralysis, vomiting and diarrhea, cold extremities, jaundice, stomach pain, low blood pressure, collapse, loss of consciousness, and hematuria, it is further classified into somnolent, delirious, choleraic, icteric, gastralgic, algid, syncopal, and hematuric types of pernicious malaria.</p>
<p>(3) Masked Malaria, Chronic Malaria, and Malarial Cachexia: Masked malaria presents with mild or no fever. Patients often experience periodic neuralgia in the trigeminal, occipital, intercostal, lumbar, abdominal, and internal organs. The spleen is enlarged, and patients may occasionally experience hemiplegia, loss of consciousness, convulsions, edema, rash, dizziness, respiratory inflammation, and gastroenteritis. Chronic malaria often develops from pernicious malaria or from inadequate treatment of tertian or quartan malaria. The fever is mild and irregular, with a yellowish-gray skin, anemia, shortness of breath, and enlarged spleen and liver. Patients may occasionally experience gastroenteritis, respiratory inflammation, kidney inflammation, and arteriosclerosis. Malarial cachexia is even more dangerous and often occurs after pernicious or chronic malaria. The face appears ashen, and the extremities or the entire body may be edematous. The skin and mucous membranes are prone to bleeding. Jaundice, ascites, and symptoms involving the nervous, circulatory, respiratory, and digestive systems often occur successively, leading to debilitation and death.</p>
<p>(4) Blackwater Fever: Blackwater fever is an atypical form of malaria caused by the rapid destruction of a large number of red blood cells. It is often triggered by quinine treatment for malaria. It is more common in tropical regions, but also occurs sporadically in Yunnan, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces in China. It usually occurs within a few hours after taking quinine, with sudden chills, shivering, headache, back pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rapid rise in body temperature to over 40 degrees Celsius. Jaundice, hematuria, bloody stools, subcutaneous hemorrhage, and enlargement of the liver and spleen may also occur. The urine is dark brown like soy sauce, with a specific gravity of 1.030 to 1.035, and contains large amounts of protein, renal epithelial cells, and hemoglobin. Severe cases may present with impaired consciousness and difficulty breathing, and death may occur during the acute phase due to heart failure. In mild cases, the symptoms may subside within a few hours after the attack, but repeated attacks are still dangerous. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e235">Ideal and Reality <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Baige</p>
<p>I once saw somewhere the following words: "Marriage is a besieged city; those on the outside want to rush in and take a look, while those inside want to escape." In the past, I found these words interesting. Now, after hearing the long sighs and short breaths of many married friends, I find them even more worthy of contemplation.</p>
<p>Life is truly like a journey to visit scenic spots. Before reaching a certain destination, the heart is always filled with endless longing and desire. Once a destination is reached, only a sense of emptiness and indifference remains. Marriage, this besieged city, is merely a famous city that is difficult to visit multiple times on a full-length journey. We can very well extend these words to all stages of life and contemplate them! Many people would think this way.</p>
<p>This way of thinking is very common. Haven't many equally thought-provoking sayings already been popular among our common people? For example, sayings like "the other mountain looks taller" and "distant spring water is clear, nearby spring water is muddy" are of this kind. In elegant circles, our gentlemen and ladies also use a fashionable way of expressing this: ideals are beautiful, reality is ugly, or at least reality is never as beautiful as ideals. Therefore, people pursue ideals and are dissatisfied with reality, constantly running in and out between ideals and reality.</p>
<p>In a truly ugly real society, it is perfectly acceptable to say that reality is never as beautiful as ideals; it is also acceptable to say that people pursue ideals and are dissatisfied with reality, but these words should not be absolutized and eternalized. Our gentlemen and ladies often like to absolutize and eternalize all concepts. According to their logic, these words can be simply stated as follows: reality is never as beautiful as ideals, and all ideals are more beautiful than reality. Ultimately, they must believe that the source of the beauty and ugliness of ideals and reality lies primarily in the so-called human nature of liking the new and being curious. Why do people pursue ideals and are dissatisfied with reality? It is due to human nature's inherent liking for the new and being curious, not because ideals and reality themselves have anything truly desirable or unsatisfactory. Once an ideal becomes reality, even something beautiful becomes ugly. In this way, naturally, as long as we reform the human nature of liking the new and being curious, we will no longer pursue ideals and be dissatisfied with reality. Without worries or hardships, it is truly a good law for settling down and living one's life. Isn't running in and out just making trouble?</p>
<p>However, reality is, after all, very real, and it will never transform ugliness into beauty simply by reforming human nature. To transform ugliness into beauty, what is needed is precisely reform of reality by people. When reality itself has not been reformed to be as beautiful as the ideal, even if we reform human nature to a state of perfect goodness, we cannot make it as beautiful as the ideal. Moreover, this "even if" assumption is fundamentally impossible. To be honest, only when reality has been reformed to match the ideal will reality no longer be ugly, and only then can the so-called reform of human nature be truly spoken of. Currently, before human history has developed to the ideal stage, the separation between reality and ideals is an undeniable fact, but this separation is not created by so-called human nature; it exists in themselves. To eliminate this separation, there are many reformers who truly pursue ideals. Reformers pursue ideals precisely because they are dissatisfied with reality. Here, the words should be reversed: they are dissatisfied with reality and pursue ideals because reality and ideals themselves truly have things that are unsatisfactory and worth pursuing, not because reality and ideals are so-called reality and ideals. Once an ideal becomes reality, they will not be dissatisfied either. They only run in, never escape, and that is completely unrelated to their human nature.</p>
<p>So, why do some people often run in and out between ideals and reality? This is naturally because they have not recognized true ideals and reality, but merely arbitrarily constructed a phantom image in their minds. True ideals and reality are independent of people's minds. Only by objectively recognizing them can people avoid being confused and running in and out between a phantom image. However, this is mainly determined by the position of some people in society and history. Decaying feudal aristocrats will yearn for the luxury of the past and be dissatisfied with reality; the rising working masses are dissatisfied with reality and look forward to the beautiful future. Only our gentlemen and ladies, having neither the luxury of the past to yearn for nor the beautiful future to look forward to, cannot help but cling to reality. However, the incomplete and decadent reality will also make them feel dissatisfied. What to do? Only by pursuing an ideal that is a phantom image arbitrarily constructed in their minds. Illusions are always easy to shatter, and the result of pursuit is naturally disillusionment. When disillusionment occurs, they want to escape from reality, but when they cannot escape, they want to run into another ideal, and thus constantly run in and out between so-called ideals and reality. If we were to use a journey to visit scenic spots as an example, the difference should be said to be due to the lingering idea of yearning for the luxury of the past. And the general "leftover youths" of the old dynasty often love to express "ancient nostalgic feelings," which probably comes from here.</p>
<p>Let's still use the example of marriage, this besieged city: why do those on the outside want to rush in and take a look, while those inside want to escape? That is because those on the outside want to rush in to gain something, while those inside want to escape to avoid panic and danger. Once this besieged city becomes a free and open paradise, I think no one will want to escape anymore.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Baotu Spring <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>Before arriving in Jinan, I was enticed by the words in the Travel Notes of Lao Can: "Every household has spring water, and every household has weeping willows. Compared to the scenery of Jiangnan, it feels even more interesting." Therefore, having arrived in Jinan, I had to put my desire for sightseeing and curiosity on some famous springs first.</p>
<p>The first day, I went to see Baotu Spring. According to Travel Notes of Lao Can, "Baotu Spring is the number one spring among the seventy-two springs of Jinan Prefecture." And in the algae-covered spring, there is a weathered gray stone stele that marks the words "number one spring."</p>
<p>Upon entering, there are stalls selling various goods. Kui said that this is a bit like the Penglai Market in Shanghai. When leaning on the iron railing on the stone bridge to look at the spring water, the yellow-tiled Temple of Lu Zu, the teahouse singing drums, and the stalls selling small trinkets and fortune tellers gave people the feeling of the City God Temple in Shanghai.</p>
<p>There are about five or six streams of spring water, each with a diameter of about one foot wide. Like water columns, they rise from the mossy and algae-covered pond, carrying silvery white water flowers, protruding about two feet above the water surface. The sound roars vividly, covering up all the surrounding noise. The mood of the tourists also seems to shift from the city to the mountains all at once. There are two or three other streams that do not bubble out but surge like boiling water in a kettle. In the remaining areas, white bubbles often rise from the algae and moss. The saying that Jinan has spring water everywhere can probably be inferred from this.</p>
<p>Workers were digging in front of the pond, reportedly starting construction to install water pipes, with Baotu Spring as the base of the water source. The Temple of Lu Zu had a sign of the technical team of the tap water preparation committee hanging on it, and the police stood in front of the door, forbidding tourists from entering. It is thought that in the near future, this number one spring will benefit the residents of Jinan, but I don't know if travelers from afar will still have the opportunity to see it then?</p>
<p>The teahouse by the pond has a sign that says "singing drums." Peeking through the soft, thick cloth curtain, one sees comfortable rattan chairs and small tea tables covered with white cloth. There are not many patrons, mostly people of middle age or older. At that time, the drum had not yet started. In addition to sitting blankly, the guests were holding an old novel of some sort, pressing their necks down. The noise drowned out everything. One feels the long, leisurely air of the Eastern people unpleasantly hitting their brows. Kui said, "Walk away quickly, people will drag you in." I don't know why, but I also felt that this was not a good place to go. It was as if once you went in, a person's ambition and vigor would completely disappear.</p>
<p>At a stall selling antiques, I saw a Westerner examining them carefully, staying there for a long time. Could it be that, as Yosuke Tsurumi said in his article "The Charm of Beijing," "the calmness and slow pace of the Chinese" have "conquered the impatience of foreigners"? But I think those who have caught the "Eastern disease" can only be attributed to foreigners who "eat seventy-three eggs every day" or "eat a pound of cream every day." As for the Russian bums who drive buses in Shanghai or carry blankets and walk through the alleys, they are not seen to "think that China is unbearably good," are they?</p>
<p>If there were no spring water like water columns gushing out in a white surge, with a sound like mountain stream water, I feel that the surrounding environment would completely give people a sense of decline.</p>
<h3 id="e237">I Strove to Struggle Up Firmly <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>The sun seemed like a ball of flames, emitting its brilliant golden light.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes that were burning like fire, it had already shot into my eye sockets, causing a stinging sensation.</p>
<p>—Yes, I should get up.</p>
<p>I said quietly to myself.</p>
<p>However, after struggling for a while, I was still lying there. Indeed, I was terribly exhausted. My stomach was like a hungry stink bug, empty and sunken. My limbs were so weak and paralyzed.</p>
<p>Lying on a bed covered with rust, I deeply buried my thin body in the dirty and tattered quilt.</p>
<p>Silently looking up at the spider on the ceiling. It was active and busy.</p>
<p>Compared to it, I felt myself to be cowardly, incompetent, a useless waste. I did not strive for life, working hard like that tiny spider.</p>
<p>My heart had been deeply pierced by pain. Due to shame, due to wounds, my whole life was filled with confusion.</p>
<p>—Yes, I should get up.</p>
<p>—Yes, I must struggle to get up.</p>
<p>—Could I just keep lying there?</p>
<p>I asked myself and answered myself.</p>
<p>So, I made a decision: "Damn it, I have to struggle to get up!"</p>
<p>Gathering courage, using all my strength, I began to struggle desperately.</p>
<p>I felt a surge of heat, as if an electric current was running through my entire body, feeling hot all over. My face was like the skin of a roast duck.</p>
<p>However, I still couldn't get up. Disappointed and saddened, I quietly lay down again.</p>
<p>Unbearable, humiliating, terrifying, hungry, destroyed, I cursed my own life.</p>
<p>Recalling the words the landlord yelled at me and the indifferent attitude of my friends, I couldn't help but shiver. This was a cruel blow to me, shattering my soul to pieces.</p>
<p>Conscious of the coming of that terrible thing, I lay there stunned, as if there was nothing to hope for but death. So, I sighed deeply. Was there no hope for everything?</p>
<p>—It's over!—I shouted with all my life's strength.</p>
<p>—Isn't it? I have already run to the end of the world. Before me is a desolate scene with countless tombs. Isn't this the final resting place of mankind?</p>
<p>Thinking about it: my nerves went crazy. Could I just step onto the "road to destruction" like this?</p>
<p>—No! No!—I said: I still have hope, I still have strength, I still have life, I cannot die.</p>
<p>I have not paid a satisfactory price for life, I have not fulfilled my responsibilities. Can I just end my life like this?</p>
<p>I often want to use my youthful energy to ignite the life of mankind, to create the meaning of life, to praise the light. Isn't this my heavenly duty to life?</p>
<p>However, my efforts have made me feel discouraged, annoyed, and resentful. Have I really become desperate?</p>
<p>Indeed, in an environment of prejudice and adversity, I don't know how many promising young lives have been submerged.</p>
<p>My footprints have traveled all over the earth: desolate, dilapidated, filled with endless tragedies.</p>
<p>Everywhere there is:</p>
<p>"Closed for Business"</p>
<p>"Business for Sale"</p>
<p>"No Entry for Unauthorized Personnel"</p>
<p>Looking at those words, I felt heartbroken, disappointed, and indignant.</p>
<p>I am sick, I have no work, no life, no place where I can use my talents.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I couldn't help but tremble again. Could I only helplessly watch myself perish?</p>
<p>—No! No! I should struggle to get up.—I answered myself.</p>
<p>So, I mustered my courage again and struggled! After groaning for a while, I lay down again, quietly and sadly.</p>
<p>Yes, I am very ill, no food, no clothes, no money to see a doctor or buy medicine. Let the devil take my life!</p>
<p>Then, a terrifying shadow of death suddenly appeared before my eyes. In the haze, I saw its cruel face, stretching out its long, bloody tongue, moving it in and out. It gradually approached my bed, opened its shining eyes, opened its giant mouth, and stretched its hairy hand to my neck.</p>
<p>—Ah!—I shouted loudly—I will not die! I cannot die! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Extinguish this devil, drive out this devil. I want to live, defeat death!</p>
<p>My voice was filled with terror, filled with power. A flame of life rekindled in my heart. So, I firmly, suddenly, struggled to get up.</p>
<p>My heart was filled with an indescribable joy, so I smiled slightly. This was a victorious smile, how precious a smile. I haven't smiled in a long time. Long immersed in a life of suffering, had I not lost all joy in life?</p>
<p>At this moment, I stood healthy, invigorated, and proudly, and I emitted an unprecedented hope for everything.</p>
<p>Yes, I am still young, I have abundant youthful vitality, I have uncontrollable passion, I have blood and violence. Relying on this blood and strength, won't we be able to create earth-shattering miracles?</p>

<p>The doctor turned around to look at him, as if wanting to devour him with his eyes.</p>
<p>"Sir, today is Sunday," Neli defended himself, smiling awkwardly. "I'm engaged!"</p>
<p>"Oh, you're engaged?" the doctor roared rebelliously. "Then hold this!"</p>
<p>While saying this, he stuffed the sick child into Neli's arms; then he grabbed each of the other little ones surrounding him, angrily bumping them against his legs.</p>
<p>"And this one! And this one! And this one! And this one! Beasts! Beasts!"</p>
<p>He turned his back to him, wanting to walk away, but then turned back, took back the sick little girl, and shouted to the two men:</p>
<p>"Go! Get the mules! I'm leaving right away."</p>
<p>Neli smiled, turned around, and walked down the stone steps after his brother. He was twenty years old; his fiancée, Rusa, sixteen: a rose! Seven children! Too few! He wanted twelve. He would feed them all with just the talent of a pair of good arms, always happy. Working, singing, using the strength of his skill to dig and sing. He was called the poet Liola for a reason. Then he felt that he was loved by everyone, loved for his attentive gentleness, his consistently good nature, and he even smiled at the air he was breathing. The sun had not yet tanned his skin, nor withered the deep golden color of his curly hair that so many women envied; if he quietly looked at a woman with his clear and bright eyes, then so many women's faces would blush, and their hearts would flutter.</p>
<p>The reason for his anxiety that day was not because of his cousin Chiaru, but because his Rusa had expressed her coyness to him, Rusa had been longing for that Sunday for seven days to be able to be intimate with him for a while. But could his conscience allow him to ignore this good deed of emergency aid? Poor Chiaru! He was engaged! How sad, suddenly, just like this! He was hitting almonds in the lower dam of Montelusa, the land of Ropa. Yesterday, Saturday morning, the sky looked like it was going to rain; but it didn't seem like there would be an immediate danger of showers.</p>
<p>But, around noon, Ropa said, "God does things at the right time, my children, I don't want to leave my almonds on the ground if it rains." As he said this, he ordered the female workers who had picked up the almonds to send them to the storage room to be shelled. "You," he said to the male workers who were hitting (Neli and Salo were also down there) "you can go there with the women and shell them if you want." "Okay," Chiaru said, "but do I still get a full shilling for the day?" "No," Ropa said, "I'll pay you half wages; the rest will be half wages, the same as the women workers." In fact, this was deceiving people! Why was there a reason to tell the male workers to stop working and not earn a full day's wages? The sky didn't rain, in fact, it didn't rain all day, nor did it rain that night. "'Half wages like the women workers'?" Chiaru asked. "I'm a man, you give me twenty-five pence a day for half wages, and I'll leave."</p>
<p>But he didn't leave: he stayed there until the evening, waiting for his two cousins, who were willing to shell with the female workers, to get half the money. However, tired of standing and watching for a while, he went to a nearby stable, lay down and fell asleep, and told someone to wake him up when it was time to go home.</p>

<h3 id="e240">Reflections on Holding a National Goods Year <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>Purchasing and using national goods is the natural duty of citizens, and striving to produce national products to meet needs is also the basic responsibility of citizens. There is no need for promotion or supervision. However, the situation in our country is very different. Clothes are not beautiful unless they are "foreign," food is insufficient unless it is "foreign," housing is incomplete unless it is "foreign," and travel is not fast unless it is "foreign." Daily necessities and the resources for food and clothing all rely on "foreign" goods. The domestically produced goods, whether natural or artificial, are almost unmatched. As a result, farmland is desolate, looms are idle, and handicrafts are bankrupt. Even the so-called "national goods," which are actually "machine-made imitations of foreign goods," are like candles flickering in the wind, uncertain. At this time, people recognize the endless economic invasion from abroad and the lack of control, and strive to promote the national goods movement.</p>
<p>However, what is the result of promoting national goods? It cannot be said that there is no effect, but after twenty years of effort, the so-called "national goods" still seem to be in their infancy, unable to keep pace with the times, which is very sad. Looking back at the year after the January 28th Incident (1933), deeply aware of the increasing foreign troubles, the backwardness of industry, and the pressure of the economic tide, the call for a "National Goods Year" was made. In that year, the citizens had not forgotten the pain of artillery and airplanes, so they received widespread support. The most obvious change was that men's coarse cloth gowns and women's checkered cloth robes became popular for a while, and the coarse cloth stores had a turnaround in business. By this year (1935), it was designated as "Women's National Goods Year." Women are the backbone of household purchases. Department stores often rely on whether they can get women's patronage and trust to predict the prosperity or decline of their business. This trend is particularly obvious overseas. If Shanghai women gradually become fond of shopping in stores and are happy to purchase national goods, then the promotion of national goods will be like water flowing downwards, reaching everywhere. Who would have thought that a year would pass quickly? Although the elimination of millions of dollars in perfumes and creams, the disappearance of checkered cloth robes, and the decline of coarse cloth business cannot be taken as signs of the failure of Women's National Goods Year, the extravagance and luxury of Shanghai women, competing for novelty and beauty, have not changed from the past.</p>
<p>The promotion of "National Goods Year" is a kind of stimulant, like giving a heart medicine to a weak heart, seeking temporary maintenance, and then seeking fundamental treatment. If it continues, it will eventually be ineffective, because stimulants only have stimulating effects and have no fundamental therapeutic power. The same is true for publicity. Although it is called publicity, there must be facts to prove it in the end. If you only do publicity, after a long time, even if the speakers are earnest, the listeners will be dismissive. For example, the annual ×× National Goods Year, the people in charge have good intentions, because only in this way can they receive great results, so they use the method of dividing years and planning stages. If it is women, if it is students, ... expanding and enriching it, then it may as well be parents, workers, farmers, ... gradually promoting it to all walks of life. Then national goods will spread without legs. Only do not think that society is a whole society, and family is a whole family. Holding them separately, those who do not know will misunderstand that this Women's National Goods Year has nothing to do with men; this Student National Goods Year has nothing to do with parents; perhaps there is no such fact, but it cannot prevent people from thinking this way. If propaganda makes people think one more time, or make one more exception, then its effectiveness will be reduced to some extent. Therefore, even with hundreds of theories, it is not as good as one point of fact. King Yue of Yue's ten years of living and ten years of teaching eventually defeated Wu; Duke Wen of Wei's coarse cloth clothes and large silk hats eventually revived because of his ability to act. Today, when talking about national goods, even children know the necessity of it. If you ask about the facts, then you will know that it is not so. Drawing paper, painting colors, as well as suits and leather shoes, household items, ... if children ask teachers and parents, what words will the teachers and parents use to answer, or will they speak separately, this is a cultural product, this is a necessity, use it out of necessity, or will they simply avoid arguing it! If they cannot, then they have already used foreign goods, and they persuade others to use national goods. How will this kind of self-deceiving and deceiving impression, left in the minds of pure children, affect them? If you want to establish yourself, establish others. If you want to correct yourself, correct others. What you do not want, do not impose on others. How can you personally commit it?</p>
<p>However, I am not saying that the national goods propaganda movement is unnecessary. Being able to promote is better than not promoting, and being able to publicize is better than not publicizing. Only after twenty years of promoting and publicizing, we still have not achieved great results. In the end, I feel that in addition to publicity and promotion, there should be other efforts. The problem still lies in only knowing how to persuade people to use national goods, but not being able to supply people with national goods, and not being able to make people happy to use national goods without complaining. Therefore, in the future, we should think more from the perspective of facts, and put less effort into theory. We should think more from the perspective of production, and do less publicity from the perspective of consumption. We should shift the spirit of National Goods Year, which focuses on consumption, to the work of working together to promote production in order to achieve self-sufficiency through use. Because there is good production, there will be good sales. If there is no good production, and people are persuaded to use it necessarily, even countries with deep-rooted economic aggression like ours can easily induce the import of foreign goods. Readers should not misunderstand that I am defending foreign goods, because the facts are like this. No matter who chooses to buy goods, they must use "cheap and good" as the standard. Even national goods manufacturers purchase materials, why not do the same? Purchasing less durable goods at a higher price is already what buyers are unwilling to do, let alone... Although purchasing national goods, sometimes it is not allowed to calculate every penny, and the overall benefit should be taken into account, national goods manufacturers should also consider the interests of the public users. If they sell non-durable goods to people, manufacturers can use the name of patriotism to sell goods and seek wealth, but if they make people turn to foreign goods because national goods are not durable or the prices are not appropriate, wouldn't it be the same as bearing the responsibility of promoting the sales of foreign goods? We have boycotted Japanese goods again and again, but every time we boycott, the import volume of Japanese goods will increase once. This is not only true in China, but in Europe, America, Southeast Asia and other places, Japanese goods can also be continuously invaded. In the interview record of Japanese Minister of Finance Takahashi Korekiyo published in the Current Affairs News (23, 12, 18), one can think about more than half of it. He said:</p>
<p>"Although countries boycott Japanese goods, Japanese goods are still exported continuously, and the voice of boycott has gradually subsided recently, because my Japanese (Takahashi claims) commodities are cheap and good, ranking first in the world. Would people in various countries rather buy inferior goods at a high price? For example, in Sino-Japanese trade, according to the latest news from the Commercial Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our country's (Japan's) exports are increasing day by day, especially rayon. Although there are some anti-Japanese people in your country (China) who are making trouble from it (?), it is still able to sell without hindrance because of the low price..."</p>
<p>It is not surprising that these words come from a high-ranking official, but Chinese people - especially national goods manufacturers - cannot but feel deeply ashamed. Why do we boycott, but it is just empty talk, without any practical effect? And why can't our country's products be "cheap and good" and make people happy to use them? "On the contrary, seek it from yourself", is it because you focus too much on publicity, seek too little for reality, embellish the scene, and waste your reputation? Therefore, there is no other way but for the masses to do their best, seek truth from facts, and bury their heads in hard work.</p>
<p>Actual work, to put it in a small way, is like the formal attire movement of the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association, which is also a good method; to put it in a long way, is like the rumor that officials in Beijing Municipal Government with a salary of more than sixty yuan should purchase a satin gown, and the notice from the Lake Society that all members will wear blue robes and black jackets for the New Year's Day group worship. Although the matter is small, its effect is huge. Someone said, in a broad sense, why not say silk fabrics. But today, silk fabrics are neither welcomed by modern women nor rejected by eyebrow men. I once said that if women wear a few less pairs of high-heeled leather shoes, and men make a few less suits, if they can completely change to silk fabrics, the benefits to the silk cocoon and silk satin industry are already not insignificant. As for the formal attire movement, in a world confused by woolen foreign goods, it is already clearly defined by government laws and regulations. If this cannot be implemented, what else is enough! How can you say that you are promoting national goods?</p>
<p>To put it in a larger way:</p>
<p>(2) How to Make People Happy to Use National Goods</p>
<p>This requires the efforts of national goods manufacturers themselves, which is the word "cheap and good" that is difficult to say but difficult to do. The so-called cheap and good is originally a comparative term. You want the price to be cheap and the quality to be good, a bear's paw is what I want, and fish is what I want, there are very few things in the world that can have both; but at least, always make people feel that buying this thing is "worth it", and the word "worth it" is the foundation of happiness. We don't need to use medicine as an analogy, but we hear that foreign goods are made of the same materials and labor. The labor in foreign countries is more expensive than in China, and they have to travel across the ocean to transport them to China, plus water fees, freight, taxes, insurance, etc. Why can they still sell without hindrance? Why is the goods of this factory suppressed by it? Of course, the "worship of foreign" psychology of the Chinese people is too despicable, which leads to this, and the goods of this factory cannot seek progress in technology, lose the trust of customers, and help the promotion of foreign goods. It seems that they cannot escape the blame.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the biggest drawback of national goods is that if a kind of goods can be sold, either the price will be high, or a hundred kinds of inferior goods will be produced, or imitations will arise, so that it is difficult to distinguish between good and bad, and it is difficult to distinguish between the good and the bad. There are already many people who mix fish eyes with pearls, and the buyers turn their heads and all die together. Therefore, manufacturers do not seek people's trust from commercial ethics, and do not seek people to use from the improvement of products, but want to use the power of propaganda, the power of words, the name of patriotism, and the help of laws to make people use them. This is contrary to the development of national goods, and it will be ineffective if it is implemented for a hundred years; only good production can have good sales; with good sales, foreign goods will naturally be cut off, and national goods will naturally prosper. Therefore, I hope that national goods manufacturers:</p>
<p>(A) Standardize products</p>
<p>(B) Refine finished products</p>
<p>(C) Sell goods at reasonable prices</p>
<p>(D) Industry cooperation</p>
<p>These four are the keys to success. All are not in propaganda, but in hard work.</p>
<p>(2) How to Meet People's Needs</p>
<p>This refers to quantity. Today, national goods manufacturers have how many percent of foreign goods? Before the analysis, it is difficult to get an overview, but it can be guaranteed that there are very few. There are only a handful of heavy industries, and only a small number of applied industries. It is very difficult to compete with foreign goods. In terms of quantity, it is even less worth mentioning. If you want people to buy them like this, and people really buy them, how will you respond? In the end, it is either shoddy manufacturing, or changing the head and face, using other people's products to act as their own. If this is the case, it is no different from promoting counterfeit national goods, which is completely contrary to the purpose of promotion. Therefore, if you want to promote a certain product, you must first check the content and production volume of the product. If you know that it is not enough to apply, or you don't know what its content is, and you think it can be applied, it is like a child learning to walk, forcing him to walk. If he does not stumble, he must be supported by someone. Therefore, manufacturers also want the product to be used by people, and should also think about how many consumers can be satisfied by the product. If it can replace foreign goods, everyone is happy to buy it, and the strength is enough to meet this demand. If not, what method will be used to supplement it? We should also start from the foreign goods and domestic products. If we can divide the work and plan the steps to gradually realize it, it is the most important thing at present.</p>
<p>(3) How to Adapt to People's Needs</p>
<p>Hobbies are different, and needs are different. Therefore, how to adapt to people's needs is what national goods manufacturers should know and should also respond to. The reason why foreigners' trade is always successful is that they pay attention to the likes and dislikes of customs and the changes in hobbies, so they can cater to people's preferences and satisfy people's desires. The same is true for their own plans. For example, the British love tea, so they transplanted tea trees to Ceylon. Italy and France like silk weaving, so they raise silkworms and mulberry trees. Americans need tung oil, so they collect tung seeds. The Japanese saw that silkworm silk was expensive and high-priced, and worried that it would be defeated by rayon, so they rushed to make rayon, and they have been able to have a large number of exports in addition to self-sufficiency, competing with European and American production in the market. The same is true for other handicrafts. What about our country? Foreigners are still trying to adapt to our needs, but we cannot respond ourselves. Superiority wins and inferiority fails, and the situation is clear. Therefore, in general, we think there is a need, and we should find a way to adapt to it. Whether this can be successful depends on the cooperation of all parties, but national goods manufacturers are the core of it. How can they not cheer up and do it?</p>
<p>(4) How to Inspire People's Needs</p>
<p>Adapting to people's needs seems to be insufficient, and we should go further and inspire people's needs. The so-called inspiration of people's needs is also like the saying "look and buy", "look" originally has no intention of "buy", "if you see it well, you might as well buy it"; on the one hand, it is because they have the purchasing power, and on the other hand, it is because this item is enough to touch their desire and arouse their need. If everything is only adapted to the present, it will not be able to progress and will lead to failure. Therefore, it can create and develop; there is production and consumption; this evolution is also the key to the evolution of human groups. Shanghai stores have also recently posted "welcome to visit" signs. Although it is said so, when you step into the door, you often leave with an unpleasant impression. Why? It lies in the improper handling, which turns into a burden for its business.</p>
<p>As for why domestic industry and commerce have failed; in terms of themselves, we can also get the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of Business Talents</p>
<p>In the fiercely competitive industrial and commercial enterprises, it is difficult to cope with the old organization and talents. Those who do not know their own limits do not think it is insufficient, but those who know it have never failed to worry deeply. The vision, understanding, spirit, and actions of the current operators of industrial and commercial enterprises should be able to adapt to the modern trend in all aspects. However, in our country, most people do not know what organization is, what the general trend is, and they are short-sighted and have little knowledge. Therefore, they can only be in good times, and they can only get small profits. Once they encounter adversity, they will be at a loss. They cannot stabilize themselves, and others can do nothing to help. Therefore, when the difficult times come, there is no way to save them. Even worse, they may affect others and suffer the disaster of the pond fish. There are countless cases.</p>
<p>I have heard that many industrial and commercial enterprises are difficult to improve because of the poor organization in the past; the habits are too deep and difficult to correct; the machinery is outdated and the products are difficult to refine; even if there are talents, they cannot do anything. It is difficult to hope for progress without major reforms. If you want to reform urgently, obstacles will arise and difficulties will gather. The best example is the ×× Printing House. After the reorganization after a major accident, everything is different from the past, but the managers are not the same people before and after; the reason why it can be like this is that the old bad state has disappeared with the artillery fire, and it is not difficult to completely transform it from scratch to meet the needs of the times, and there is today's result. There are many Chinese industrial and commercial enterprises similar to this, what else can I say!</p>
<p>(2) Lack of Management Talents</p>
<p>The ability of the factory to produce fine and cheap products is closely related to the management talents; if the management is not good, the materials will be wasted, the working hours will not be economical, the products will not be refined, the costs will increase, and the sales will be difficult. The current factory management personnel often cannot have both, that is, (1) have experience but no knowledge, (2) have knowledge but no experience. Those who have experience but no knowledge are mostly foremen who came from workers; those who have knowledge but no experience are students who came from schools; those who have experience but no knowledge do not know how to improve and stick to the old methods; those who have knowledge but no experience only talk about theories and lack practicality; each should have a way to remedy it. The former should set up remedial classes to teach new knowledge, so that they can improve; the latter must first have sufficient practice in the engineering they manage before they can be actually authorized at the beginning of their employment; I heard that Japan also had this problem at first, and after this correction, it has today's achievements.</p>
<p>(3) Lack of Technical Talents</p>
<p>Technical talents are the mentors of factory products. It is the responsibility of technical talents to promote the old and produce new, and to make products refined. Although the Chinese people say that they have changed their old ideas, secretly observing the general public, the old thoughts and habits have not been completely transformed. Therefore, the cultivation of technical talents is not as many as the text and economic ones; even if there are some technical talents, they are often "heroes have no place to use their talents", and they abandon what they have learned. Talents are needed in other aspects, but there is nowhere to seek them. Half of the talents are buried because they cannot be adjusted, and half are lost in training. People often say that science can save the country. In the future, we should have the spirit of respecting scientists and cultivate technical talents to solve the current difficulties of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>(4) Lack of Workers' Skills</p>
<p>The success of factory products, although under the guidance of technicians and managers, is made by the hands of workers; therefore, the quality of workers' skills is closely related to the quality of products. Because of the lack of education, workers in our country often do not know a word, and even in their work, they only know what it is, but do not know why it is, so it is difficult to have progress. Furthermore, workers have recently been seeking to improve and increase their living standards and treatment from time to time; but they have not seen their efforts to improve the efficiency of their work; even the work has regressed, and the efficiency has decreased, resulting in increased costs and degraded products. Therefore, how to improve the discipline, service, and skills of workers is of great importance to Chinese industry and commerce.</p>
<p>In addition, such as lack of capital, and lack of flexibility in turnover, it is not easy to develop. In particular, the desire to seek immediate benefits is too urgent, so there is no long-term plan, it is difficult to fight a protracted war, and it is easy to be controlled by others. Some people think that the financial industry does not invest in industrial and commercial preparation, I am not a member of the financial industry, and I have nothing to do with the left and right wings, but the only condition for the investment of the financial industry is safety, that is, the possibility of recovering its principal and interest. Today, whether the industry and commerce themselves are sound, I dare not make a general statement, but if the organization is precise, and it is indeed in financial difficulties but has a promising future, if the financial industry does not help it, then its intention is questionable.</p>
<p>In addition to the internal defects, Chinese industry and commerce also have external infringements. Here, I will focus on the aspects that are closely related to national goods factories to save space:</p>
<p>(1) Material Issues</p>
<p>The so-called national goods now, to be honest, can be said to be processed and manufactured products of foreign goods, because the materials used are mostly foreign goods, so it is still difficult to compete with foreign goods for a day's growth. Foreign businessmen know that a certain material is a competitor to their certain goods, then they may as well raise the price when ordering materials, so that their products are still difficult to compete with foreign goods, this is one. Furthermore, those who can protect industry and commerce and resist foreign countries use tariff barriers to block them, but for countries that cannot supply their own materials, such as raising tariffs, it is no different from increasing the cost of domestic products. Thirdly, if all materials and supplies are supplied by imports, it is no different from handing the power of life and death of our industry to foreign merchants, and we will never be able to get rid of their shackles, and there will be no day to eliminate them. Therefore, the whole country should work together to promote the success of the following matters:</p>
<p>(1) Material self-sufficiency, should be phased and divided into industries, and the implementation should be planned from all aspects, and the final goal of self-production and self-sufficiency should be achieved;</p>
<p>(2) For important industrial products, the materials of which cannot be obtained from abroad, the import tax should be reduced to a certain level;</p>
<p>(3) The import tax on unnecessary edible products (such as seafood, vegetable head food, etc.) and the same type of foreign goods whose products from domestic industry and commerce can勉可應付應 be increased to prevent dumping;</p>
<p>(4) We should do our best to improve agricultural products, build water conservancy, and develop mineral products in order to enrich materials;</p>
<p>The above concerns the self-sufficiency of materials and also involves tariff issues.</p>
<p>(2) Factory Establishment Issues</p>
<p>Since the Treaty of Shimonoseki between China and Japan caused a great mistake, allowing foreign merchants to also set up factories in trading ports and treat them equally with Chinese merchants, it was originally not surprising; but in a country where our industrial and commercial knowledge and skills are childish, what we can rely on to contend with foreign merchants is only the geographical convenience and cheap labor. Now that we share it with foreign merchants, our financial resources are inferior to others, our technology is inferior to others, and our management is inferior to others. How can we live with them in one place? The advantages and disadvantages of Sino-Japanese textile factories can already be seen in general. After the increase in tariffs, the psychology of foreign merchants to set up factories locally to manufacture is more firm, so the number of facts that have been expressed is unknown; if we allow it to continue to advance, the poison will be worse than the import of foreign goods, and Chinese merchants' factories will inevitably be a catastrophe and cannot be saved. The so-called "bone gangrene" is also. Talking about abolishing the treaty, I don't know how many treaties that have expired should be abolished but have not been abolished, so there is no need to talk about it. What I hope from the authorities is only to increase the factory tax and raise the bonus for Chinese merchants' factories. If there is only an increase in taxes without giving bonuses to Chinese merchants, then it will destroy its own industry and commerce, what else can I say!</p>
<h3 id="e241">Review of China's Coal Mining Industry in the 23rd Year of the Republic of China <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Wenqing</p>
<p>According to Mr. Weng Wenhao's estimate in 1932, China's coal reserves amounted to 240.81 million tons. Shanxi Province accounted for the largest share, totaling 127.127 million tons, exceeding 50% of the total reserves. The four northeastern provinces, which had been forcibly occupied by the Japanese, also had 4.61 million tons. Here, we must pay attention to one fact: the coal-bearing areas in China have not been fully developed; however, in areas such as the four northeastern provinces, which are under the control of foreign capital, the degree of development is quite high. The investment of foreign powers in Chinese coal mines is more than three times that of Chinese capital. Shanxi, the richest coal-bearing province, only produced 760,000 tons of coal in 1932, while the four northeastern provinces produced more than 8 million tons annually, Hebei produced more than 6 million tons, Henan produced 1.6 million tons, and Shandong produced more than 1.5 million tons. The coal industry in the four northeastern provinces has now become the source of military supply industries. The Fushun coal mine is the biggest threat to Chinese and even British investment in Chinese coal mines. Of the 6.6 to 7 million tons of coal produced in Hebei Province, more than 90% is produced by British capital; one mine alone produces around 6 million tons annually. Furthermore, some Chinese-owned coal companies have already mortgaged parts of their assets to Japan. Henan Province produces approximately 1.6 million tons of coal annually. Here, the British-owned Fu Company holds a dominant position. Although the Zhongyuan Company is currently sending personnel to reorganize and reduce workers, it has long been under the control of the Fu Company. The Liuhegou coal mine is also a famous coal-producing area in Henan Province and is currently managed by the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company, which, in other words, has already fallen into the hands of Japanese capital.</p>
<p>The Shandong Province seems to be the only one with a relatively strong presence of national capital. In 1932, Shandong's output was 1.57 million tons, of which 540,000 tons were produced by the Japanese-owned Luda Coal Mine, and the rest was produced by Chinese-owned enterprises. As for coal mines in other regions, such as the Pingxiang Coal Mine, which is entirely under Japanese control, there is no room for development. Although Shanxi's coal reserves are abundant, this only arouses the insatiable desire of foreign powers and does not help the development of national enterprises. Shanxi Province's controlled economy policy has not only failed to gradually develop the province's industries but has also led to "goods being abandoned on the ground" due to the heavy transportation costs and taxes, preventing development. The Tianjin Dagongbao published the following record on January 18, 1934: "The coal freight rate across the country is the highest on the Zhengtai Railway, and the freight rates set by the railway also vary greatly for each mine. ... A freight rate of 7 li per ton-mile for railway coal transport is the standard international rate. Although the BeiNing Railway for Beipiao coal, the XiangE Railway for Hanzhi coal, and the Jiaoji Railway for Luda Mine may not fully meet the 7 li rate, the difference is not significant. However, the Zhengtai Railway charges 0.024 yuan per ton per kilometer for Shanxi coal, which translates to 0.047 yuan per mile, which is five to six times higher than the international rate, and four to five times higher than the freight rates on other Chinese railways." Here, we must point out that the railways mentioned above, whose freight rates are not significantly different from the international rate, transport Beipiao coal, Luda coal, and Hanzhi coal, etc., all of which belong to foreign capital. In other words, foreign-owned coal can enjoy lower freight rates, while purely domestic coal cannot enjoy this preferential treatment. Thus, it can be seen that all Chinese railways discriminate against foreign and domestic goods.</p>
<p>The above is the general situation of China's coal mining industry. Now, we want to trace the general situation of the past year. Under the conditions of the deepening global economic panic and the increasing activity of foreign capital in China, China's national economy is heading towards a dead end of total bankruptcy. China's self-operated coal industry is naturally no exception. The consumption of coal is decreasing day by day due to the weakness of the general public's purchasing power and the shutdown and reduction of work in general factories. As a result, the price of coal is also falling rapidly. Let's take the coal produced by Kailuan as an example.</p>
<p>Price Fluctuation Table for Kailuan Coal (Unit: Yuan)</p>
<p>|        | No. 2 Lump | No. 1 Powder | No. 2 Powder |</p>
<p>|--------|----------|----------|----------|</p>
<p>| 1933   |          |          |          |</p>
<p>| December| 10.8     | 10.9     | 9.1      |</p>
<p>| 1934   |          |          |          |</p>
<p>| January | 10.1     | 10.1     | 9.1      |</p>
<p>| June    | 10.1     | 9.6      | 8.6      |</p>
<p>Although the nominal price of coal increased somewhat between October and December 1934, the actual price was below the low price in June. At the end of the year, coal merchants had to sell at reduced prices to obtain cash due to financial constraints, so the price of coal was even more likely to fall.</p>
<p>Now, we want to look at the amount of coal imported into Shanghai. We do not have accurate figures for the import volume in November and December, so we have to assume that the import volume in those two months is similar to the same period in 1933 (in reality, it is clearly decreasing). The figures should be as follows:</p>
<p>1931: 3,617,000 tons</p>
<p>1932: 2,942,276 tons</p>
<p>1933: 3,329,358 tons</p>
<p>1934: 3,192,767 tons</p>
<p>Compared with the previous year, 1934 decreased by about 140,000 tons. Here, we must also point out that the quality of coal imported in 1934 was generally worse than the previous year, the reason being that the import of Chinese-produced coal has slightly increased (this phenomenon is truly both annoying and gratifying)! The increase and decrease in the import of Chinese coal and Japanese coal are as follows:</p>
<p>|                      | January to May 1934   | January to May 1933   |</p>
<p>|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|</p>
<p>| Chinese Coal         | 1,057,965 tons       | 896,167 tons          |</p>
<p>| Japanese Coal         | 189,343              | 531,933              |</p>
<p>According to the table above, the import of Chinese coal has increased considerably, while the import of Japanese coal has decreased by two-thirds. According to the figures released by the Coal Association, the import tax on domestic coal from January to November increased by 250,000 tons compared with the same period in 1933, while the import of Japanese coal decreased significantly.</p>
<p>However, the above phenomenon is by no means sufficient to indicate the superiority of Chinese coal. On the contrary, it is a manifestation of China's increasing colonialization. Why do we say this? Because the decrease in Japanese coal imports is not due to an increase in Chinese coal production, or an improvement in quality, or a decline in Japanese coal production. The reason lies in the rapid progress of Japan's military supply industry in the past one or two years, which requires a large amount of coal and iron ore. In particular, since the establishment of the Showa Coal Company in early 1933, it has cooperated with the Japanese Industrial Federation to conduct controlled sales of coal. Even the Fushun coal mine in the Northeast (which is, of course, already in the hands of the Japanese) has seen a significant decrease in its imports due to the needs of supplying Japanese and local industries.</p>
<p>|                      | June to October 1934 | January to October 1933 |</p>
<p>|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|</p>
<p>| Chinese Coal         | 1,067,700 tons        | 862,604 tons          |</p>
<p>| Fushun Coal         | 169,442              | 266,954              |</p>
<p>Chinese coal from companies such as Datong, Huainan, Kailuan, and Zhongxing is indeed in fierce competition with Japanese coal, which has led to a sharp drop in coal prices. Coal from Japan and the Northeast is indeed difficult to compete with Chinese coal. However, we must note that the so-called Chinese coal at this time is not the product of purely Chinese-owned enterprises. Much of the coal is still produced under the British capital system, and some is even the product of enterprises jointly managed with Japanese capital!</p>
<p>Import Volume of Coal from Various Places from January to October 1934 (Unit: Thousands of Tons)</p>
<p>| Coal Mine Name | Volume | Coal Mine Name | Volume |</p>
<p>|----------------|--------|----------------|--------|</p>
<p>| Zhongxing        | 350    | Kailuan          | 930    |</p>
<p>| Shandong         | 440    | Datong           | 30    |</p>
<p>| Hua Dong         | 70    | Huainan          | 65    |</p>
<p>| Total           | 2,140   |                 |         |</p>
<p>The import volume of Kailuan coal accounts for almost half of the total import volume. Generally speaking, since the September 18th Incident, the trend of Chinese people rejecting Japanese goods has been strong, so judging from the import of coal in Shanghai, Chinese coal has indeed increased slightly. Shandong coal imported from Qingdao, Liujiang coal imported from Qinhuangdao, and Shanxi coal imported from Tianjin have all increased. From January to October 1934, the import volume of these coals, nominally called Chinese coal, reached as much as 2.14 million tons. During the same period in 1933, the import volume of these coals was only 1.75 million tons.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a look at the import situation of other foreign coals. Previously, the total annual import of Hongji and Haiphong anthracite coal from Hongji and Haiphong in French-controlled Annam was as high as 300,000 tons. After China implemented a new tariff in May 1933 and increased import taxes, these anthracite coals were greatly reduced. The new tariff implemented on July 1, 1934, increased the import tax on anthracite coal to about six yuan per ton, which had a significant impact on the import of foreign coal. For example, from June to October 1933, their import volume was 35,632 tons, while in the same period in 1934, it suddenly dropped to 18,920 tons.</p>
<p>In summary, although the import of foreign coal in 1934 has decreased, this situation can only indicate that Japan and other countries have drastically increased their demand for coal due to the development of their military and general heavy industries. Generally speaking, this situation should be a favorable condition for the development of China's national coal industry. However, based on the current facts, China's most important mining industry (note that, in terms of the current level of technology, mining is a basic condition for the development of the entire national economy, especially the industrial sector), is mostly in the hands of foreign capital. In recent years, the Kailuan Coal Mine has almost become an arena for British and Japanese capital to compete. Although Britain controls the mining rights, Japan wants to expand its sales of Fushun coal and further wants to encompass the rich resources of the entire North China. It is therefore doing everything possible to destroy it. Secondly, we see the recent active activities of the Japanese in the Shandong Luda and Hanzhi Ping Company aspects, which really make us shudder. They also often send survey teams to Shanxi, Suiyuan, and other places to investigate. In addition to its military significance, this action is at least a strong motivation for the seizure of the rich resources of North China. Looking back at our country's situation, although there is a reorganization of the Zhongyuan Liuhegou mines, the power has fallen into the hands of foreigners, and the results are not good. Other places have also suspended work and reduced work, and all are constantly proceeding. If this continues, China's coal industry will inevitably fall entirely into the hands of foreigners. The increase or decrease in Shanghai's coal import volume in 1934 can only manifest the expansion of foreign coal power in disguise.</p>

<p>|| Not Weakened by Sunday ||</p>
<p>Although yesterday was a Sunday, most small banks were still making transactions during the bidding period, causing the foreign exchange market to remain firm. The price of foreign exchange lending was 6 jiao in both the morning and afternoon sessions, which was 5 fen higher than the previous day. In terms of bill transactions, over 1.4 million yuan were transferred in the morning session, with over 800,000 yuan in new transactions. There were over 900,000 yuan in transactions in the afternoon session. The Small General Association had over 800,000 yuan in transactions. Foreign exchange mortgage transactions saw over 800,000 yuan in redemptions and over 1.2 million yuan in new loans.

In terms of subsidiary currency, the market atmosphere was also brisk. The Jiangnan small yuan was still 850 yuan in the morning session and rose to 860 yuan in the afternoon session, resulting in an improvement of 10 yuan compared with the previous day.

<h3 id="e243">Bond Market Relatively Stable Last Week <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Last week, from December 24th to 29th, was the last week of December for the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, and also the last week of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Despite the soaring foreign exchange lending rate, the extreme tightness of credit, and the extreme silver shortage, it was able to pass safely and relatively stably. According to the first two days of the week, Monday and Tuesday, were the last two days of December futures. There was talk in the market that HSBC had shipped back 20 million yuan of silver, and there was some squeezing of shorts and squeezing of longs in the market. However, squeezing shorts was still more common. There were many swap and arbitrage transactions by various groups and retail investors. Because the market price was close to low and far to high, it became increasingly distorted, and all those with active credit were arbitraging, especially in the case of the 96 type, with a monthly interest rate of more than three points being the largest. Therefore, although many deliveries were made in the 16th and 48th types, they were almost defeated by retail investors, and the market price was able to be stable. On Wednesday and Thursday, only one-month futures for January were traded. The foreign exchange lending rate was 4 jiao every day, but people's hearts were not moved by it, and the transaction was very clear, with more people entering the market. The market price had a good face of three or four jiao every day. Friday was the delivery date for December futures. The delivery volume was 40 to 50 million, and the foreign exchange lending rate was as high as 6 jiao, which was the highest price in recent years. This was because the delivery of public bonds required about 30 million yuan temporarily, so it was also temporary in nature. On Saturday, the foreign exchange lending rate was still 5 jiao and 5 fen, which was due to the delivery of cotton cloth and had nothing to do with the influx or outflow. Two-month futures began to enter the market, and there were immediate swap transactions and settlements, because there would be a five-day holiday after this, to avoid the risk, it had to shorten the battle line. Because banks such as the Central Bank and Bank of Communications released 10 million yuan in foreign currency to circulate in the market, people's hearts were at ease, and the market was firm and stable. The transactions of the 23rd year of the Republic of China ended here. According to the year's experience, it should be one of the best years since the September 18th Incident. Since the sudden decline in the Min Affairs at the beginning of the year, the market price has gradually risen. The military reduction has risen from more than 59 yuan to 83 yuan, and the salt tax has risen from more than 45 yuan to more than 64 yuan. The peak was on July 9th, which was the highest price of the year, and also the highest price since the September 18th Incident. The major reasons were the stability of the political situation, the gradual suppression of banditry, and the gradual realization of North-South unity. Moreover, due to the loose and excessive silver credit and the concentration of hot money, although there were unfortunate events such as the emergency of the Japanese-Russian situation, the arrogant statement of Hirota, and the disappearance of Kuramoto, they also rose and fell quickly and did not hurt the overall situation. Since autumn, the outflow of silver has intensified, and the cash reserves in Shanghai have become increasingly depleted. The financial community has sold out month by month, and the foreign exchange lending rate has gradually increased, relying only on retail arbitrage to maintain its stability. Therefore, rumors such as the depreciation of silver coins, inflation, and paper money policies are not facts. The Ministry of Finance has the determination to maintain such a market, and the future is optimistic. At the end of the year, the market price results were mixed, with only a few jiao. The total turnover was 82.472 million yuan.</p>
<p>Exchange Announcement: December 31st is the closing date for all brokers, and the exchange will be closed for one day. January 1st to 3rd, 24th year of the Republic of China, are New Year's holidays, and business will resume as usual from the 4th.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with favorable news from Liverpool and Mumbai. Foreign merchants bought in, with price fluctuations of 1 to 4 points for each month. Later, the long positions in the January term continued to close out, and the remaining months also saw profit-taking sales, so the market situation softened. Finally, due to the optimistic environment, the industry worked hard to buy in, and the trend rebounded strongly. At the close, each month rose again by 2 to 3 points. The spot price was unchanged, and the futures price rose by 1 to 4 points. The spot price of British cotton rose by 1 point, and the futures price was unchanged. Indian cotton was weak due to a large number of long positions taking profits. The prices of Pingguo'er and Aomula rose by 1 rupee, while the price of Bairuoxi fell by 7.5 jiao. The original telegram is recorded on the left (29th telegram).</p>

<h3 id="e245">The General Ledger of Hope <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Ge Bai</p>
<p>The calendar has been turned to the last page. From the moment I hung it on the newly wallpapered wall with a ball of hope, and tore it down page by page until today, I feel that the days have passed too quickly. But that ball of hope seems to still be stuck at that time, but when I think about it, it seems too long ago.</p>
<p>The newly delivered calendar is standing upright on the desk with a smile, welcoming me: Happy New Year! Yes, in twenty-four hours, it will be a new beginning. Opening my blank diary, can I still reserve this unfulfilled hope? And who knows what the scene will be when this new set of calendars is turned to the last page?</p>
<p>Humans seem to be forever deceiving themselves. The past is all dead yesterday, and the future is all born today. They put hope in front of them, forever chasing after it, and turn their lives to the last page like a calendar, even leaving it to the next generation to chase after the lamp of hope, just as the old calendar is replaced by the new one, and then torn page by page from the beginning.</p>
<p>I have entrusted my life to hope and can't remember how many sets of calendars I have turned through. On this day every year, I tear off that thin page of the calendar without hesitation, and then happily hang up the new one, as if the hope I have reserved is gradually approaching, and I don't know how much of my life has been wasted!</p>
<p>Looking at the gray wall, this last page is about to become a trace in an instant. Can the new calendar, with a happy New Year smile, competently fulfill the responsibility of this "general ledger"? I am afraid that when it is turned to the last page next year, it will still be an unanswered pending case!</p>
<h3 id="e246">When the Calendar Turns Over <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Yingying</p>
<p>Mr. Si sat in front of the raised broken account table, rubbing the impossible-to-blow-away wiping paper, while flipping through the desk calendar placed on the account table! His initial intention seemed to be to count how many calendar pages were left? But just as he touched the shiny chrome-plated desk, which was really like being woven from cotton threads, he suddenly became top-heavy and somersaulted forward. He stared blankly at the supporting legs under the desk for a long time!</p>
<p>He remembered very clearly and accurately. This calendar was specially brought by his son, who worked as a clerk in a large Shanghai bookstore, along with the New Year's goods at the end of last year. Of course, this also cost a lot of money. Not to mention that it is rare in the countryside; even in Shanghai, only large stores and large companies can afford such an exquisite chrome-plated desk calendar, and his son's letter mentioned it several times.</p>
<p>When Mr. Si received this exquisite calendar that he had never seen in his life, he was so happy that he broke a piece of glass on his old glasses, which had been with him for decades.</p>
<p>But he did not regret it. The antique glasses piece, which he had lost for decades, was exchanged for the latest dazzling white copper calendar.</p>
<p>Every day, after getting up, he had to personally turn over the calendar date, as if he had done something proud, and he was happy as if he was!</p>
<p>But recently, Duan Zhen's face has gradually become ugly. Turning the calendar is no longer as happy as before. It seems that this is the work he is most impatient to do; however, if someone else accidentally forgot to turn it over and turned over yesterday's date for him, he would become furious!</p>
<p>It is true that Mr. Si has something important on his mind.</p>
<p>Every day after getting up in the morning and washing, he habitually called for a water pipe, and then many worries formed hundreds of knots on his forehead!</p>
<p>Every day so many people have to eat, but every day no one comes to buy anything. Seeing Wei Fu sitting beside the counter only dozing off, and Chun Gen foolishly looking at the scenery outside like a silly person. In fact, what can Duan Zhen tell them to do? Sometimes it's really hard to bear. After Chun Gen eats, he also nods off. Even if he is forced to get up, he is told to sweep another piece of land.</p>
<p>The counter is piled full of sixteen large palm fans and thirty oiled paper fans that have not been sold for a long time. Except for opium smokers, no one will ever ask about these things.</p>
<p>He also had a time when he thought wishfully that perhaps next summer he would make a great fortune, then he could raise the price, and he could still make money.</p>
<p>The Qian Jingji landlord came to collect the rent six times, and yesterday, when he left, he really rolled his eyes at him for a while.</p>
<p>If you don't pay me back next time, I'm going to seal the door!</p>
<p>He trembled for a long time because of this sentence!</p>
<p>When he got up today, his palms were still trembling so badly. As a result, he lightly turned the calendar, and for no reason it would fall forward.</p>
<p>He will never have a chance to turn over like the calendar!</p>

<p>— Qian Hong</p>
<p>The sky hangs low, gray clouds congeal like heavy lead, but snowflakes dance in the air with the north wind. Today, although it is the Christmas of Jesus, wealthy people are celebrating a glorious holiday. However, he had no choice but to brave the snow and wander the streets, begging for his wife and children who were waiting to be fed. He walked back and forth, reaching out in the snow to those noble people coming out of theaters and restaurants, pleading, "Please, do a good deed!" But each time he received only disappointment. When he stepped into his dilapidated home, all he brought back was cold and hunger! He staggered in, stood at the threshold swaying his body, and shook the snowflakes off his clothes. His wife, seeing him, eagerly asked, "Did you get anything?" "No, not even a copper! Alas! Nothing!" He replied wearily and weakly, then went to sit on the edge of the bed. His wife followed, wanting to offer him some comfort in his sorrow. But when her hand touched his shoulder, she couldn't help but cry out: "Oh! You're soaked through!" "Soaked through? It snowed so heavily just now, and it was the time when the theaters were letting out. I stood there for over an hour at the racetrack, thinking I could hail a car for someone and get a few coppers. But what happened? I just stood hungry in the slush, watching people crowding out, happily squeezing into cars and carriages. The snow was falling so hard, I had to dodge the horses' heads and the cars, getting soaked through. All I got was 'Get out of here, you beggar! Get out, get out!' scolding..." He had barely finished speaking when his wife, tears streaming down her face, said to him with sorrow: "You haven't done anything bad, why should people treat you like this..." These words made him roar like a wounded wild animal: "Why should they treat me like this! Have I done anything wrong? The company went bankrupt,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>I can't find another job, is that my fault? Damn it! Those people either lecture you or curse at you!" "Isn't that right? This morning when I took little Bao Bao out to try to find a solution, the ladies on the street all said, 'You shouldn't bring a child out on such a snowy day!'" This reminded him that when he went out, the innocent child was still crying for food. He turned around and saw that the child was fast asleep. So he thought, the child must be full, right? The moment he thought of this, he felt relieved, as if he had fulfilled his responsibility as a father to raise his child! He forgot the pain he had suffered today, he forgot the cold he felt in his body and the hunger in his stomach. However, he finally asked his wife: "The child must be full, right? What about you?" His wife, who seemed to be lost in thought, was a little puzzled by his question. She replied doubtfully: "What? Full? Where did that come from? Alas! It doesn't matter if we adults go hungry, but this child is so pitiful! From crying with hunger to being exhausted!..." His wife was sobbing. At this moment, the child wrapped in a tattered quilt also woke up, crying that he was hungry and wanted food! The crying made him feel really hungry too. He looked painfully at his wife as she soothed the child, saying "It's not dawn yet, good baby! Go back to sleep, don't cry, daddy brought sausage noodles home yesterday!" This made him think of the good old days, and the miserable life after losing his job. He had thought of committing suicide, but that thought was shattered by his self-esteem. Until today, he was still struggling on the edge of death with his wife and children. He cried out madly: "No, I want to live! I want to live! I want to bring back money and food!" He suddenly left the edge of the bed, ignoring his wife's calls, and rushed out the door again. At this time, the sky was still hanging low, the gray clouds were congealed like heavy lead, and snowflakes were still dancing in the air.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Old Tales for the New Year <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>If it weren't for the various decorations and scenes adorning the streets and alleys that made me reluctantly realize that another new year was arriving, this day would have quietly passed by unnoticed. Now I have to put on a smiling face and say to people, as they do to each other, "Happy New Year." In this vulgar sound and smiling face, there is clearly an infinite joy hidden, and the light of infinite hope is shining. But only I am helplessly masking my dark face and pretending to be as happy as everyone else. In fact, all the joys of the world have long been unrelated to me. The eyebrows of others are painted with rare shadows of joy in the New Year, while I have given all of these to sighs and tears.</p>
<p>Passing the so-called New Year with a heart full of sadness.</p>
<p>After wandering outside for many days, my mood and thoughts have been gradually worn away by the complicated affairs of the world to the point of almost losing their function. I remember when I was young, as soon as I heard that the New Year was coming again, I would be so happy that I would jump around all day and couldn't sleep at night, eagerly awaiting the day to come. The New Year was indeed the happiest time for us children, with things to play with and good things to eat. We could do whatever we wanted, and the adults would always listen. Even if we made a big fuss, no one would care. Adults were especially compliant with children's requests at this time.</p>
<p>And on the eve of New Year's Eve, we would gather around the stove with the family to stay up late. These things are ancient history now, and thinking about them only brings about an unspeakable sense of melancholy. Actually, there's no need to trace back to such distant events. Even in the years before I left my hometown, on the eve of the New Year, all I had to do was take a stroll outside in the morning and see fresh red couplets pasted on the doors of every house, and then listen to the sound of firecrackers popping everywhere.</p>
<p>Although I was already standing outside the circle of children setting off firecrackers, being in such a situation would unconsciously cause a scene akin to childhood to surge from my heart.</p>
<p>Now, even this fantasy of the heart is over.</p>
<p>For several years, I have been wandering on the long road of life, feeling the vicissitudes of human affairs and the fleeting nature of life, especially feeling the insignificance of my own life. Squeezed into this sea of people like waves, fierce waves are constantly rolling up, and I know at any time that there is a possibility of being swept into the waves and submerged. Even if not, the boulder of the heavy pressure of real life is enough to knock me down. The burden of life is getting heavier year by year, and it has become heavier than what an ant-like me can bear.</p>
<p>The increase in age is accompanied by the increasing weight of the burden of life. Continuing like this is no different from approaching the edge of the grave day by day.</p>
<p>The New Year has come, and my feet are softened again by the sudden increase in weight on my back, and my eyes are blurred.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Moon Overhead Night <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Hui Ren</p>
<p>Because I often hear people reciting the line, "How many times in life do you see the moon overhead!" the poem aroused my determination to wait for tonight.</p>
<p>Usually, when I wander alone in the moonlight, I always see my shadow cast in front of or behind me, which looks very lonely. Because of this, I become sad alone, either thinking about home or lamenting my own fate. Except for a poet or someone who already has a companion, most people will feel a little sentimental about the moonlit night! Because it is strangely gloomy and doesn't give people any warmth. In the past, some people used silver-gray...sentences to describe or symbolize their environment, which can also prove people's reflection on the moonlit night scene.</p>
<p>As for the moon overhead night being very close to the arrival of the New Year, this seems to give people a stimulus, telling people not to let themselves fall into depression again, and should start a new life in another new year. It hides your shadow, which is equal to telling you to forget the past.</p>
<p>After finishing dinner today, I am preparing for how to enjoy it. As for cigarettes, coffee, tea, etc., they have already been planned. Watching the clock tick by minute by minute, watching the moon move eastward little by little, I feel as happy as if a happy event is coming.</p>
<p>Tonight the frost is very heavy and the wind is blowing very hard. Looking at the clouds in the sky, they are also very dense and heavy. The moon is constantly being swallowed and spit out by the clouds, which makes me worry. Will I not be able to see the moonlight at midnight? The time spent is a small matter, but the disappointment afterwards is a bit...</p>
<p>Time is sinking moment by moment, and the environment is becoming silent little by little. The sound of footsteps on the street can be clearly counted. I thought that there would be no one active on the street anymore, but strangely, almost every half hour a team of heavy leather shoes would pass from the street, loudly singing songs in their mouths. Later I learned that it was the night patrol team of Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>This seems to be a great stimulus. It ruined my moon viewing tonight, and it destroyed the happiness in my heart! Because it brought me some inevitable awareness problems, almost touching my heart like a thorn, especially when the sound of their leather shoes approached the park.</p>
<p>Finally, I know that sadness is not simple, personal, but complex, everyone's; that is, the moon overhead cannot illuminate its own tail, showing its own sadness, but similarly, others will come.</p>
<p>As a result, there was no moonlight at all at midnight, but the electric lights on the road cast my shadow, which was strangely long, on the ground.</p>

(Wang Xifeng is (Hua Tang drunken after wine Yan, going into the garden to call Xiao Hong. The bone-chilling wind makes her tremble. Light clothes exposed to the cold are unbearable. She calls the maid to take the silver rat waistcoat. The child is considerate and leaves in a hurry. (Xifeng is) Moving her lotus steps lightly. Walking slowly. (Suddenly feels) A huge, hairy thing behind her. Hair stands on end, suspecting it's a ghost. (It turns out to be) A dog holding his paws, meeting the master. Fang Fang is uneasy. In front of Qiu Shuang, the order is for the moon to be covered. The winding rockery winds around. Is it real or an illusion? Whose maid comes to the garden? The cherry mouth shouts wildly, the language is incomprehensible. (Auntie) It's hard to meet across the road and Yin Yang. Nobles are blessed with foolishness. (Xifeng is) Stealing a glance with pretty eyes. Who has ever met a beautiful woman? (Auntie) Ronghua has ruined romantic generations. Riches and honors are floating clouds in the end. Recalling the grand wish at the time, the base of the ten thousand-year career is empty. (Xifeng is) Concentrating and lowering her head in frequent thought. Has the brain ever recorded a shadow? (Auntie) Remembering loving me before I was born. Now we will be separated in the East and West. (Xifeng is) Confused and lost in thought. (It turns out to be) Qin's previous life was married to Jia Rong. The ghost of the underworld should rest in peace. Why show your supernatural powers under the moon? Glaring angrily and spitting lightly. Accidentally, a pebble falls on her beautiful face. Tired of being covered in fragrant sweat.</p>

<p>Opening "Childhood Love"</p>
<p>Midnight. Unease. Like weeping. The sound of the cuckoo. Suddenly recalls childhood love. Thinking back to when we loved and protected each other like siblings. It was hard to be apart for even a day. Young and innocent, we didn't know love. Playing in the same courtyard was innocent. Later, when we grew up and gradually understood the meaning of the spring breeze, we realized that love was deep. Like intertwined branches. Like two hearts. We had a predestined relationship in our previous lives. Who knew that the Old Man of the Moon had no fate in his book. No name on the Three Lives Stone. Unexpectedly, my aunt took Ji Shu to the East Sea. It was a fate created by the heavens. We parted with tears. Suddenly, several springs have passed. I suppose Ji Shu is happy between husband and wife. I am still a virgin. I have forgotten three meals, tea, and drink. I still have no companion to spend my good time with. For you, my bones are thin and my face is haggard. My mind is confused and my dreams are chaotic. For you, I did not match a noble relative and went against my mother's wishes. I only love Ji Shu with all my heart. It's a pity that there is still no shadow of it. The Magpie Bridge still has the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meeting. Is it possible to meet again in this life? Thinking about it for a long night, I want to break my soul.</p>

<h3 id="e255">Appreciating a Confidante: Kinnie Raymons Accepts an Engagement with RKO <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Su Hua</p>
<p>The more profound the stimulation one receives, the longer the impression remains in the mind. This is a very common law of memory. Do we still remember her? That innocent and lively "Sweetheart" – Nancy Carroll. What a deep impression she left on us! Although it has been many years since she starred in "Youth Club" ("Follow Thru"), I'm afraid most of us haven't forgotten it. In recent years, she seems to have become somewhat distant from us, and we haven't seen her films. The apple-like face and those two charming dimples have been longed for by many. This is because she has left Hollywood for several years, left the hustle and bustle of the film set, avoided the glaring mercury lights, and gone to Europe to enjoy a somewhat leisurely life. Before she left Hollywood, she actually co-starred in a film with the now-famous Kinnie Raymons. At that time, Kinnie Raymons was just a new actor on the silver screen, and that film co-starring with Nancy Carroll was his first appearance on the screen. Although that film was not produced in Hollywood, his performance at that time was recognized by Hollywood production companies. They immediately invited him to the studio. Over the years, he has worked tirelessly, coupled with his innate talent; his art has been steadily improving, and he has now become an important figure in leading male roles. Isn't his success in "The Great Waltz" ironclad proof? Kinnie Raymons was born with a talent for acting. He played child roles at the age of five, and later he even left his original school to study at a drama school. After graduating, he lived his stage life. On the talent-rich Broadway stage in New York, his theatrical talent and his youthful handsomeness had already gained him considerable recognition and special attention. Sylvia Sidney, the leading actress in "Madame Butterfly," had already collaborated with him on stage and achieved success. Now both of them hold high positions on the Hollywood star throne.</p>
<p>In addition to being a talented actor, Kinnie Raymons is also an all-around athlete. He can ride horses, swim, box, fence, and also play tennis and golf very well. Haven't we already admired his good piano playing in "The Great Waltz"?</p>
<p>Of course, he is now praised by the world in Hollywood, and he should be extremely grateful to Nancy Carroll for his first collaboration with her. After Nancy Carroll returned to Hollywood and finished filming "Springtime for Henry" for Fox, RKO hired her with a large sum of money to star in the million-dollar epic film "Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round," which had been in preparation for many years. With the "Sweetheart" starring in this epic film, the female lead was of course not a problem. It was just the selection of the male lead that troubled the authorities at RKO. Of course, they all knew that Kinnie Raymons was the most suitable talent for this film, but Kinnie Raymons was a very famous and popular star who was not bound by contracts, and everyone was vying to hire him, fearing that he would not be able to spare the time. Later, the company felt that it would be difficult to succeed unless Nancy Carroll went to discuss it with him. Of course, Nancy Carroll was the helper of his success, and he would definitely not refuse. So, as soon as she came, he immediately rejected the contracts of other companies and agreed to her. The "Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round," which is about to be released locally, was finally completed after RKO exhausted its personnel, effort, and money. Kinnie Raymons' spirit of appreciating a confidante is of course admirable; and how could our "Sweetheart" not be moved by it? (The End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e256">Review of "The Merry Widow" <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>| Nanjing |</p>
<p>I remember when sound films were just maturing, "The Love Parade," starring Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald, caused a sensation in Shanghai. That film was not only a large-scale musical, but also in color, which gave the audience great satisfaction. At the same time, the names of Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald became known to everyone, young and old, and the songs from "The Love Parade" became household names. That kind of grand occasion is something that people will not forget.</p>
<p>Based on this alone, one can determine the box office success of "The Merry Widow." It is also starring the leading actors of "The Love Parade," and the audience of Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald will naturally not easily let go of this opportunity to enjoy it. As for the silent film "The Merry Widow," its influence on the audience is naturally also very great.</p>
<p>In addition, we might as well further explore the reasons for the box office success of this film. It is very clear that the fantasy of the story gives people beautiful dreams. That handsome and dashing count, that beautiful and affectionate wealthy widow, in such a luxurious and extravagant environment, with a happy ending, the structure of such a story is similar to the Chinese stories of talented scholars and beautiful women that people welcome. Especially at present, in the midst of the cruel reality that gives people very unpleasant situations, this film is even more sufficient to give noble people a wonderful comfort, although this comfort is very empty. As for some viewers, they are also very familiar with the name of the director Ernst Lubitsch, which may not be one of the reasons for the box office success.</p>
<p>Now, let's examine Lubitsch's style. From "The Love Parade" to "The Merry Widow," his style has not changed. His stories are certainly far from reality, and in the completely fantasy plot, what he needs are grand scenes, luxurious props, and gorgeous costumes. Thus, talented men and beautiful women, in the joys and sorrows of the plot, in the beautiful songs, in the graceful dance troupes, he grasps the charming scenery, the romantic atmosphere, and the gentle affection, which are all so-called bright and harmonious styles. In short, he should be a typical capitalist film artist, and this "The Merry Widow" and the like are naturally outstanding works of capitalist films.</p>
<p>In terms of the old-fashioned expression methods of film art, people cannot find so-called flaws in "The Merry Widow." Everything seems smooth and brilliant, whether it is the gentle dialogue, the intoxicating music, or the frivolous movements, under the appropriate weaving and tempo, everything is a top-notch expression of capitalism. Of course, it should be mentioned here that the screenwriters Enrest Vajda and Sarnson Raphaelsono handled the rhythm of the play very smoothly, and Franz Lehar's composition also helped the film to achieve success. As for Jeanette MacDonald's acting skills, when she kissed his hand, her subtle expression of her inner feelings and desires in silence, just this point alone can prove her experience. As for Maurice Chevalier and the actor who played the ambassador, they both performed extremely well.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Review of "The Pearl Necklace" <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>| Carlton Cinema Screening |</p>
<p>Bao Tianxiao's novel "Empty Valley Orchid" was praised by most readers at the time. After the Star Film Company made it into a film, due to Zhang Zhiyun's considerable success in acting, it even more widely appealed to many audiences at that time.</p>
<p>The reason why the novel "Empty Valley Orchid" was able to "cause a sensation" was not accidental, but because it used some emerging facts at the time, such as trains, photography, medicine, female teachers in schools, patriotic wars, and freedom of marriage, to quite successfully express the general new tragicomedies in society at that time, and ethically and emotionally explored the old conflicts of love and jealousy. At that time, this relatively new creative attitude and method was indeed more accepted and welcomed by the general emerging classes at that time.</p>
<p>With the full-dialogue sound film "The Pearl Necklace," which only appeared on the scene at the end of 1934, we should give it a new evaluation because of its new posture. But it is a bit regrettable that this new "The Pearl Necklace," compared to "Empty Valley Orchid," does not seem to give the audience anything more or better, except for replacing part of the subtitles with dialogue. If I am not too demanding, some of the deeper and more touching parts in the silent film do not seem to have the same effect here as before.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire film, the author seems to be a little weaker in his skills, somewhat constrained by the story, and only using the pictures to explain, without enriching and deeply portraying what is necessary. In other words, the transition scenes are done well, but many places that serve as the center and climax of this script also pass by flatly. A play based on ethics, which should have a full emotional expression, lost its due effect due to the inadequate handling of the atmosphere in the picture. Some shots are simply a waste, and dialogue was not used to save unnecessary scenes. For example, in the picture, Lan Xun rode his horse for a long way, and then Zhu ran to tell her father, "Brother is here," and then there is a section of Lan Xun riding his horse before they meet. Zhu said to Lan Xun, "I'll go tell my dad," pointing to "That's my dad," and then a long piece of film is shown, they meet, and Lan Xun asks again about "your name," etc. At the wedding banquet, the picture has already shown many seats, and then Lan Xun comes to invite the guests out, repeating a piece of the seats that had been shown. After the child is sick, since Mrs. Lan was called by telephone, it is not necessary to use the picture to repeat the doctor's words, and Lan Xun had already called her on the screen, and You Lan still makes many trivial expressions, and in the telephone, she also repeats the scene of the doctor seeing the child with dialogue. It is not necessary to call the roll a second time for a mother who is also a teacher to know that a child is absent due to illness, as it is not needed to be explained. Because dialogue and pictures cannot be used to complement each other, the randomness and repetition make the whole film scattered and loose, reducing the power of the play.</p>
<p>Language, as the main part of a sound film, is the defining significance of a sound film, but the speech in "The Pearl Necklace" feels too unreal. The stage language of Chinese sound films did not start with "The Pearl Necklace." The language in the first half of "Song of China" is also too artificial and exaggerated. We know that on the stage, in order to make more audiences hear clearly, it is necessary to be more artificial and exaggerated than usual, but sound films have the effect of loudspeakers, so being artificial and exaggerated is not only unnatural, but also harmful. In addition to the artificial and exaggerated tone in "The Pearl Necklace," the dialogue in the section about hiring a maid is also as sharp as that of a Beijing opera Dan (female) role.</p>
<p>Makeup is also not well applied here. In addition to some people not using makeup to help with expressions, Fan Xuepeng's eye makeup looks worse than swollen when looking down.</p>
<p>The voice and face of the child who plays Liang Yan's child are not suitable. I think using a more pretty and lively person to play the role would better show the character's pity and loveliness in the play, in order to increase the effect of the play.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Ye Qiuxin and Wei Pengfei are better. Fan Xuepeng may not be very suitable for acting in this kind of play, so she is just average.</p>

<p>— Bai Yun</p>
<p>"Empty Valley Orchid" is a popular and well-known novel. Before, there were only silent films, but now Tianyi Company has made it into a sound film, renamed "The Pearl Necklace," co-directed by Shao Zuiweng and Gao Lihen, starring Fan Xuepeng, Ye Qiuxin, Chen Qiufeng, Wei Pengfei, and more than a dozen other major stars. The plot is full of joys and sorrows and is very moving. There are several specially made new songs in the film, such as Gao Tianqi's "Hypnotic Song" and Ren Guang and An E's collaboration "Wishing My Brother Returns," with very melodious notes. The exquisite scenery and costumes, and the clarity of the light and sound, surpass all other films. The film has been officially screened at the Carlton Theatre since the 30th of this month.</p>

<p>(Part 1)</p>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>Lasky-Fox Production, Starring John Boles, Loretta Young, etc.</p>
<p>Mitchell Lee Hospital has newly recruited seventy-five nurses, including Joan, Zita, Brandy, Codylo, and Vicki. Joan is intelligent and beautiful, and is obviously the best among them. She chose the shy Zita as her roommate, and Brandy and Codylo also grouped together. Zita, newly entered the hospital, found the work too heavy and felt overwhelmed, and missed her lover in her hometown, and was depressed all day long. In order to comfort Zita, Joan said that she also had a lover, and that lover was none other than the nationally renowned polo champion, the wealthy young man Lonar Wahl III. Because when they were talking, they were flipping through a newspaper, and Lonar's photo happened to be revealed in front of them, so Joan made it up. Unexpectedly, Zita actually believed it. Later, when a group of new nurses ran to a nearby pharmacy to eat ice cream and malted milk, Zita told everyone what Joan had said. Everyone who heard it also believed it, except for Codylo, who was self-confident and did not believe that Joan was Lonar Wahl III's sweetheart. She openly expressed that she did not believe it, so she argued with Brandy, and neither would give in. So the two of them made a bet. Codylo immediately wrote a letter to Lonar Wahl, asking him to clearly answer whether he and Joan had a marriage contract. Lonar Wahl received Codylo's letter and knew that someone was pretending to be his fiancée, and was very angry, but his secretary was very discreet. He replied to Codylo on behalf of Lonar, and did not deny the marriage contract between Lonar Wahl and Joan. In this way, Codylo lost the bet, and in a fit of anger, Codylo focused on taking the opportunity to retaliate against Joan. Sure enough, when Joan was practicing being a patient, Codylo tried to harm her, but the director of the nursing class, the fat Sarah, saved her.</p>
<p>When the six-month trial period was over, several of the original ten first-class nurses were removed from their positions after being singled out. But one of them, a Southern woman named Anna, usually did not study hard and did not worry, but when the time came, she actually passed and was retained. Later, Joan actually became acquainted with Lonar Wahl III. As it happened, the newspaper that day prominently published that Lonar Wahl was coming. In order to prove whether Joan and Lonar had a marriage contract, Codylo specially brought several companions to Central Station to see if Joan would come. Joan really came. Just as Lonar Wahl got off the train and was about to step into the car, Joan rushed up, pushed Lonar into the car, jumped in herself, and quickly ordered the car to drive away. In the car, Joan shyly apologized to Lonar, telling him the reason why she had to do so under the pressure of her companions. Only then did Lonar remember the letter he had received before, and realized that the person who was pretending to be his fiancée was this person. But Joan was so beautiful, and now being in the same car with her, he couldn't help but fall in love at first sight, and was very lucky. He not only agreed to Joan's request to temporarily save face for her, but also went all the way to the West, and actually accompanied Joan to the pharmacy near the hospital. The nurses there all gathered around to see Joan's fiancé. Joan introduced them one by one. Lonar even gave each of them a big bag of candy. So Codylo had nothing to say. However, things in the world turn out to be true, and before he left that place, he had indeed fallen into the abyss of love with Joan. (To be continued)</p>
