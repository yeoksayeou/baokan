<h3 id="c18">日僞經濟統制之透視英 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>據日昨中外電訊喧傳。日僞當局已同意訂立與國防恊定有同樣効力之日僞經濟共榮條約。藉詞開發滿洲國民經濟。實則企圖加嚴樹立日本對於僞國之支配權威而已。本月五日東京所傳電訊略謂。日内閣資源局所擬關於日僞間經濟统制之原案。係將滿洲經濟建設之大權。授予滿鐵公司。採取由僞國委托該公司代辦之形式。一切施設。僅向僞國作事後報告。而該公司之方針。則秉承日内閣之節制辦理云云。可知日本此次之召僞當局赴日。實屬一種事先之凖備。推其心理。所謂共榮條約也者。無非欲藉此更澈底的向我東北民衆施行强力之剥削。以求穏定日帝國主義之經濟危機而已。但以吾人觀察。在今日環境下。日人之於東北。固未嘗有從容作經濟開發之餘暇。卽其所企求之殖民利益。亦未必眞能有補於其國内之危機。推言其故。约有數端。</p>
<p>日本自奪取東北四省以後。一切設施。莫不以樹立軍事根據地爲第一義。觀於近日所採取之政策。尤爲信而有徵。卽以交通一端而論。如拉濱綫之完成。旣少經濟上之價值。而敦圖路之實現。尤在爲軍事交通謀極大之優勢。日人以南滿鐵路爲控制東北交通動脈之大本營。凡其所舉辦之事業。處處使之適合戰時之需要與組織。此固吾人之所熟聞者也。更以最近之事實證之。日人已决心將錦承路延至多倫。以爲進攻俄國横截西比利亞之凖備。其欲以我東蒙爲對俄作戰根據地之用心。亦已昭然若揭。此一端也。</p>
<p>不寗惟是。日本之掠我東北。實因恐懼當時東北當局作經濟自衛之企圖。迨我方開闢交通與包圍滿鐵之形勢將成。日人之野心。乃充分暴露。東北淪亡後。日人裁制我三千萬同胞經濟命脈之政策。變本加厲。如各國金融資本之相率退出。我國商業公司之横受取締。皆爲此種政策存在之反映。職是之故。目前東北各地之資本商品　　。　　全年日本勢力操縱之下。東北人民　手胝足辛苦操作。不過爲日帝國主義者添益巨大之利潤耳。此其趨勢。非惟不能使東北人民之經濟力漸形雄厚。反足造成日本本國金融資本與東北殖民勢力間之對立與糾紛而已。糾紛之形式。或爲軍閥與金融資本家之暗鬥。或爲金融資本家内部系統之明爭。無論勝負誰屬。固與日本平民無涉。此又一端也。</p>
<p>故由現勢而論。日人之企圖整飭其對滿經濟侵略之陣容。而締結日僞經濟共榮條約。但能謂爲出於其軍事上之急需。殊不足以言穏定其國内之危機。我三千數百萬之東北四省同胞更何能沾其絲毫之餘惠。最可痛者。以我東北同胞處境之困苦。縱在平時。尚無以塡日人無窮之慾壑。矧日人統制經濟之策略實施後。便將運用軍事徵發之手段。敲骨吸髓。寗有噍類耶。</p>

<p>（東京）今日定例閣議前、齋藤首相與高橋山本兩相會見、謂對西園寺公旣已報告决意維持政局、則應放棄向來政黨内閣中間内閣之立塲、認識現内閣獨自之立塲、并須樹立獨自之政策云云、促二長老之考慮、復於閣議時報告、謂旣已决意維持、可不必急於補充文相、所最緊要者爲樹立與决意維持有密切關係之政策、故林陸相之訪問園公、亦係開陳内政國策之意見云、後獲得閣員之諒解、茲待林陸相返京、於下次閣議全體出席後、恊議根本國策、决定後先在地方長官會議時、由齋藤首相説明之云、（六日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）據首相左右之觀察、首相訪問西園寺公之结果、旣决意担當時局、今後須積極謀善處之法、因此或要求政民兩黨總裁之入閣、以謀實現舉國一致内閣、亦未可知、蓋小山法相亦於四日訪問首相、對治安維持法之未能成立、表示引責辭職之意、如果實現、閣員將缺二名、僅簡單之補充工事、不能望内閣之永續、故此時有斷行改造内閣之機運、首相之意、可歸納於下三點、卽（一）爲打開一九三五六年之危機、應統一國論、舉舉國一致之實、（二）因此須謀統制内閣、考慮國民所信賴之人物入閣、（三）故内閣之補充工作、不僅補充文相而止、有更斷行積極改革、一新内容之必要云、本日爲首相訪問西園寺公後最初之定例閣議、昨晚　切書記官長曾訪首相接洽一切、結果、首相於本日閣議僅報告訪問園公之經過、及披瀝今後繼續担當時局之决意、激勵閣員、請其恊力奮鬥、並謂林陸相因訪問園公、未能出席、專任文相之補充、亦將於日内决定、今後政府將遂行之重要國策大綱、俟他日再行討論云、蓋今後政府應採之根本國策、須俟内閣改造後决定也、（六日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）荒木陸相下臺後、財閥對軍部之追擊更急、不但在國會搶回滿鐵監督權、打碎關東軍特務部之滿鐵改組案、今又再進一步、迫軍部改革關東軍之組織、縮小關東軍之特務部、予以最後之打擊、聞林陸相亦已同意、定今夏七月中之定期調動期、實行其改革案、據傳其内部如左、</p>
<p>（二）財閥主張取消特務部、惟軍部内情甚複雜、如裁撤則受荒木派之反攻、軍部之統制甚感困難、故取折衷辦法、僅縮小其組織、阻止軍人參加各種産業組織、</p>
<p>（二）特務部現有五部、則分爲財政金融部、交通部、農林業部、工鑛業部及法制部等、歷兩年之歳月、已决定其對滿建設之具體案及其調查材料、雖未得盡其完善之調查、所剩無幾、故五部仍存、而各科及人員各减其半、使該部足以完成其殘務、而不足支配各産業、</p>
<p>（二）特務部長現時爲關東軍參謀長之兼任、財閥曾主張由文官選任、惟已縮小其組織、其職務已改爲消極、雖武官兼任此職、並不發生問題、此點財閥决不再爭、一任軍部自定之、</p>
<p>（四）嚴防籍屬軍人之特務部員、參加各種産業組織、</p>
<p>（五）此種改革、定七月一日起實行、</p>
<p>右述大綱之改革案、現在參謀本部及陸軍部軍務局擬稿中、如荒木派不出阻擾、則可實行云、（六日華聯電）</p>
<p>華聯社東京通訊三月三十日、日内閣開閣議、審定其對滿政策、此案在國會曾發生問題、又將與鄭逆熙逆商定具體辦法之基本案、故受各方之注意、因其内容易引起國際間之歧視、日政府方面嚴守秘密、據東報所傳之内容、略述如左、一、對滿之經濟産業政策、應以滿鐵爲主、實行日方之政策、故要先决定經濟産業建設之根本國策、然後决定滿鐵公司應如何改組、</p>
<p>二、解决日［滿］之關税問題、實行日［滿］之經濟統制、</p>
<p>三、擴大滿鐵之組織、並改善其内容、使滿鐵具有統制全滿經濟之實力、</p>
<p>四、滿鐵受任經營之僞國鐵道、須站在國防交通及産業之需要、從速擴充其内部並改革其經營方法、</p>
<p>五、滿鐵公司所有之鐵道以外之事業、須由滿鐵公司分離獨立、誘本國資本家自由投資、</p>
<p>六、滿鐵附屬地行政權、由滿鐵移交關東廳統治、</p>
<p>七、關東廳新設滿鐵監理官、監督滿鐵之一切設施、但此項設施須待樞密院核定、</p>
<p>八、雖屬國防交通之基本工業、亦不受關東軍之直接統制、一般歸滿鐵公司之統轄經營、</p>
<p>此案係内閣資源局根據關東軍及滿鐵之意見、站在財閥立塲、從新擬定之對滿政策大綱、軍部對此案甚不滿意、在閣議後發表意見如次、</p>
<p>一、對滿政策應認［滿洲國］爲獨立國、與日本立在對等地位、且要採取利益均分主義、</p>
<p>二、資源局案欲使滿鐵傍系公司獨立、以便於資本家投資、並由日政府予以必要之補助、如此則表示日本欲與［滿洲國］競取利益、由滿洲吸收一切之利益、結果必剌激［滿洲國］新興勢力、對日本生起對立之意識、</p>
<p>三、俄國認日對滿之政策、欲從政治及經濟兩面獨佔［滿洲國］、藉此向滿洲人民宣傳、結果日本自爲俄國證明其宣傳屬實、於日方不利、</p>
<p>四、資源局案旣在此種不澈底之基礙、不是謀兩國之共榮、故欲謀兩國之共存共榮、應取合併主義、採托拉斯組織、對滿鐵公司下外科手術、否則難得兩國之恒久的經濟統制、</p>
<p>軍部之意見如此、甚不滿意此案、林陸相訪元老後、或有切實表示、但軍部已不願取内政革新手段、爭取政權、指導權已漸歸於財閥、該案亦不致有大變動矣、</p>

<p>（華盛頓）美國羅斯福總統在一年以前、卽希望國會接彼以禁止軍械出口之特權、今則參衆兩院對於禁止軍械出口問題、意見大相懸殊、因此總統對於此事之希望、大有不可捉摸之槪、當羅斯福總統就任之時、正遠東與南美風雲緊張之際、故總統要求該項特權、無非爲世界和平計耳、如總統一旦有權可以禁止軍械出口、則總統所需之地位、足以使美國與列强合謀杜絶從任何國輸出危害世界和平之軍械、羅總統之顧問在國會委員會之前宣稱、各國政府都有禁運軍械出口之權、美國政府爲與各國採取一致行動、以謀世界之和平、故亦要求國會予以同樣之權力、參衆兩院本已通過［授總統以禁止軍械出口特權之議案］、且總統亦深信關於此事、國會必將授彼以廣大之權力、但在總統顧問之目光中、兩院通過之各案中、僅有一案差强人意、依照衆院通過之議案、則總統有權可與他國合作、以禁止以軍械運至交戰國、但參院則於衆院之議案外、又提一附文、内稱行使禁止軍械出口權時、對于雙方交戰國應一視同仁、無所偏袒、依照該附文卽使美國一國或與他國合作、願對于交戰國宣佈禁止軍械出口、亦有所不能矣、據稱總統對于該案之步驟有二、其一則爲接受參院之附文、其二則爲力求參院單獨的通過衆院之議案、如總統採取後者、則所遇之困難必更多、因參院中反對該案之少數議員、有法使該案暫時擱置、且國會議事日程甚促、該案或竟爲參院永我延宕、如總統採取前者、則未免顯示政府之屈服、但總統與其顧問或認爲爭奪此次權力之犠牲、得不償失、而决將接受參院之附文、藉以自慰而已、（五日路透電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）參議員瓊森所提對未付戰債國家、勵行財政封鎖之法案已於一月十日四月四日、由參議院及衆議院、先後通過、此項法律、規定對美欠債未償之國家、不問全部拖欠、抑係一部分欠付、均不得再在美國市塲、發行各該國債劵、此案通過之後、此間政界對其適用之範圍、頗多疑問、例如英國及其他若干國家、對於歷次到期戰債、固曾償還一部分、以示並不賴債、究竟瓊森法律、對此等國家是否適用、殊爲問題、有人謂一九三三年六月十五日及十二月十五日、英國及其他若干國家、償還一部分戰債時、羅斯福曾函復各該國政府、謂美國政府對各該國之償還一部分戰債、並不視爲不履行契約、但新法律之起草者參議院瓊森氏、則謂［財政封鎖、對一部分欠債國與全部欠債國家、均適用之、條文甚爲顯明、英國自亦包括在内］、國務院方面、本日對於新法律、尚不能予以精確解釋、至於英國大使館方面、則謂英國償還一部分欵項、以示英國有承認債務之誠意一層、美屢次致英政府公文中、已明白承認、則瓊森法律當然不能適用於英國云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美參議員瓊森所提對於未付到期戰債各外國政府、停止財政接濟案、已由參衆兩院通過、只待羅斯福以命令頒布、卽可生效、此案將英國與其他欠債未償各國、同等看待一層、極爲英國各界所不滿、官塲靜待該法律實行後、再定辦法、英國輿論以爲美國國會對英國所以如此嚴厲者、其原因由於英國上年度預算案、盈餘三千一百餘萬鎊、美國人心理以爲英國國庫充裕、何以不還美債、而不知英國財部對到期戰債、所以未嘗全數償還者、並非庫欵之缺乏、其故實在另一問題、蓋美國一方要求各國償還戰債、一方又嚴閉美國市塲、使外國貨物不能入口、如此辦法、焉能使國際貿易流動自如耶、英國之不願全數償還戰債者、端在此耳、至於禁止歐洲各國再向美國借欵一層、此間絶不重視、因倫敦市塲資本充盈、正患無法放出也、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c87">法國人在滇省之活動 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>｜美記者游滇所得印象｜</p>
<p>美國鮑　　　太陽報駐華通信員　　般登氏、近曾游歷雲南、考察法國在該省活動之實况、將其見聞撰文載諸紐約時事月刋、茲照譯如左、以資參考、</p>
<p>華人方面、指責法日兩國對於彼等在華活動之勢力範圍、有一種諒解、此説引起對於法蘭西遠東帝國之注意、按法在遠東、除廣州灣租借地及在津滬漢粤四處之小租界外、其勢力集中於印度支那、而在中國西南部尤其外人罕到之滇省握有特别利益、法人亦不諱言、近數月來、華人批評家覺得日本在滿洲之舉動、使列强在華之均勢動摇、勢必引起他方面之反動、因有法國卽將佔領雲南之説、此項説詞、不僅根據於相信法日間對於分割中國有諒解、並根據於法在雲南之活動顯然增加之事實、</p>
<p>通信員（著者自稱）因鑒於此種傳説之廣播、遂親往滇省旅行、實地調查法人活動狀况、調查之後、覺並無可以顯示法人正擬急劇改變其目前政策之徵象、但其在滇省之獨占的控制顯然　增、則余確有所發見、</p>
<p>滇省對外較便利之交通、祗賴鐵路一條、而此路經過印度支那、其所有及管理之權、均在法人之手、該路從東京灣之海防起、經印度支那之首府河内、再至雲南省城、全路雖僅長五百三十哩强、但其經過滇境之二百八十八哩一段、山路崎嶇海拔聳峭、在滇越邊界處約高二百五十尺、在雲南府則高至六千四百尺、該路無特别快車、又山路多盜、故夜間停開、從河内至雲南府、須歷三日、</p>
<p>滇省内除少數區域外、全部皆山、蓋其省境泰半乃在包括西藏與川省大部分之希馬拉耶大高原上也、其若干山峯高出海面二萬二千尺、因此之故、與中國他部恒不相往來、</p>
<p>在滇省北界之揚子江、僅有小船可以通航、若由雲南府以駱駝旅行至叙府、需時二十三日、再由水路至上海其間須停擱多站、此路全程至少須六星期、</p>
<p>尚有一路、係以駱駝由省城至蒙自、改乘鐵路至桂省之南寗、再由西江水路達廣州、需時約一個月、反之、從廣州經海防至雲南府、則不滿一星期、又從上海經海防至雲南府、亦不過十日、再則由駱駝隊旅行、頗爲耗費、僅有販運鴉片堪任之耳、</p>
<p>多年前、曾有敷設一滇缅鐵路之説、但英人方面、至今未實行對法國勢力作此挑戰、近來亦未有提議者、故法國控制雲南之門户、一無反對、封固之貨物經過印度支那、爲法人所不許、故一切運往雲南之貨物、經海防時、必由法國海關檢查、一切出入滇省之旅客、當然亦須取得法國護照、雖據余所知、此種護照、從未被拒給與歐人或東方人、然旅行者、均受重大監視、</p>
<p>商品之運輸、則常遭禁止、凡來自非法國的來源之軍器或藥彈、槪不能經由東京入滇省、凡軍用品雖來自法國方面者、亦非由法當局給予特許不可、然一與法人友好之政府、不難取得其所需之軍用品、自不待言、當余在雲南府時、曾有價值美金一百四十五萬元之軍火交到、此數約當該省預算收入之百分之六十、亦可附帶説明者、無綫電收音發音機、法人均列入軍用品内、禁止經印度支那運入滇省、卽來自法國來源者亦然、余在雲南府時、曾見該機一套、係一華人從上海經叙府之入者、其運費恰等於該機在上海之售價、凡用於製造軍火之任何物品、必須領得特别許可證、方能從東京運入、例如在雲南府之英國醫院、必須從駐在該地之法領事取得准許、始能運入各種必要之酸劑、</p>
<p>飛機亦被列入軍用品、在一九三二年、有雲南政府所購美國機六架、被拒絶運輸、後經華盛頓國務院抗議、始得通過、其後滇政府續購四架、乃從一法商行家購得者、</p>
<p>由由印度支那經過之各貨、皆被片種種之税、惟錫之出口除外、蓋由條約訂定免税也、所徵各税之額、以印度支那境内所銷耗各貨之税額爲比例、法國貨輸入印度支那、其關税率當然較外貨爲低、其經過税亦然、因此輸入雲南之貨、法貨視非法貨佔優勢、華貨亦受同樣歧待、目下滇政府雖在與法方訂約、期使華貨視非法國的外貨稍佔優惠、然當記者草此文時、法國尚未批准该約也、目下各種通過税之總額、最低者爲法貨之值百抽五、最高者爲非法貨之值百抽十五、</p>
<p>各種通過税與運費、皆隨時大變其率、並不先知照外商、其目的蓋在優惠法商也、例如數年前、一美商與法商英商競爭供給滇政府所需之自來水管、美商投標之價、洵屬甚廉、彼亦自信不致爲法商所壓倒、然合同卒爲法商所得、後乃查知當法貨水管運到海防時、河内車站張貼公告、聲明水管通過税已臨時减低、而鐵路運費亦由路局布告暫减云、</p>
<p>除上述之獨占的方法外、關於非法貨之運輸、常聞有稽延及破裂之訴説、據云法貨從海防至雲南運輸頗迅、而非法貨則恒須兩個月乃至六個月始運到、如是、在中國他部、法國貿易雖遠不及英美日三國、而在滇省則佔有其對外貿易之百分之六十强、固不足怪矣、</p>
<p>按在滇省之外國貿易内、美佔百分之二十、英佔百分之十五、其他非法國之外國（德日兩國爲主）止佔百分之五、至於外國商人、祇有德人一名、爲一華商小水電公司所雇用、此外無有非法人之外國商人在滇省者、除法國商業以外、所有少量外國商業、如美孚油公司等、咸爲華人所經營、</p>
<p>雲南雖爲中國第二大省、其面積達一四六七一四方哩、然非重要之商業區域、人口祗有一千一百萬之譜、三分之二爲漢人、三分之一爲苗族、苗人大都乃極貧者、對外貿易、除軍火一項不列入海關報告外、在一九三○年總值達美金二○五五六一九四元、一九三二年則跌至四五八二、九二一元、</p>
<p>錫與鴉片、爲滇省兩大輸出品、前者多之銷美國、後者全銷於本國、錫産總值年約美金三百六十萬元、鴉片值三倍於錫、</p>
<p>全省可耕之地約百分之二、專種鴉片、米糧須從外輸入、農田在全省面積中祗佔少份、致有若干地方人民常苦飢饉、雅片爲軍人榨取私利之主要來源、其税餉佔該省公收入之百分之二十、吸烟之人普及全省、其數多於余所曾到之中國任何他省、</p>
<p>雲南除産錫外、尚有許多其他鑛産、如煤·鉛·鋅·銅·銻·銀·及多量而劣質之鐵、今祗錫鑛一項廣爲開採、法人對於各礦、從未要求開發、至少暂時以專掌握鐵路交通爲滿足、</p>
<p>滇政府之主要成分、爲軍人的寡頭政治、其領袖爲龍雲將軍、表面上服從南京、實際則完全獨立、龍氏似並不過分的與法人友睦、但爲取得軍用品之供給、不得不與法人交結、且據華人方面所説、法人於雲南財政上保有一種堅固之控制、此说得有權威的中立方面之大量支持、蓋滇省因財政狀况之不穏、其銀圓價時時下跌、當其政府藉錫或鴉片之出售、在上海或香港取得貸欵時、此等貸欵輒爲法國銀行所收買、該行在省城設有一分行、乃在滇省之唯一外國銀行也、</p>
<p>法人在中國西南其他區域之野心、並不顯明、自一九一四年以來、曾有一種計畫、擬在粤省廣州灣與印度支那邊界間这沿海造一鐵路、經桂滇兩省而達雲南省城、再經四川叙府達重慶、關於此項鐵路之合同、曾由前北京政府與中法實業銀行恊議、該銀行且曾以墊欵若干交與北京政府、後該銀行倒閉、欵亦未還、該草合同内未有若不履行條件合同卽行作廢之規定、迄今法國旣不將該合同　渡與别一法人公司、亦不肯取消之、故法國除控制滇省鐵路之外、在西南全部握有此種旣得之權利、而在地理上、並具有特别之利益焉、</p>
<p>至於他國、除日本中國不計外、多與法國之政策有利害關係、英之於缅甸西藏、儼然爲保護國、對四川亦眈眈注目、而此三地皆與雲南毘連、又蘇俄以西藏爲俄與英屬印度間之緩衝國、對於西藏之將來、當然不能漠視、由是言之、法蘭西之遠東帝國及其帝國主義的野心、實與在亞洲之勢力平衡有深切關係也、</p>

<p>原著刋載ＴbeＮeueＷeltbubqe、pra</p>
<p>gueLiberalWeekly係德文、</p>
<p>由MaxRudert在ReadersDizest上摘要轉譯、</p>
<p>日本對於世界貿易的恐怖、可以在下列價目中看出、於世界市塲上握牛耳的、當然要能够比他競爭者賣得便宜、而日本在歐洲市塲的售價、可以大略分别起來、有下面的數目、</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>電燈炮每只二分半係金元</p>
<p>男人襪每只四分半</p>
<p>金筆尖自來水筆每枝七分半</p>
<p>九件咖啡用具每套四角九分</p>
<p>自由車每輛四元五角六分</p>
<p>她的棉織物、可以比歐廠出品的成本低百份之四十至七十、譬如日未最好的人造絲、在馬賽的售價、比在里昂的紗價還低、就可以想見、一個歐洲實業家曾説、［假使我的原料至偷來的、佣人工錢不付、恐怕還不能和這種價錢競爭、］</p>
<p>這種驚人的低售價、也是因爲他們工作時間的長、工錢低、以及日元有系統的膨脹百份之六十的缘故、其工人每日十時至十二小時的工作、所得的酬勞如下、</p>
<p>煤工二角六分</p>
<p>織絲女工三角五分</p>
<p>機匠八角一分</p>
<p>陶工五角三分</p>
<p>火柴工三角三分</p>
<p>還有日本所允許的十歳以上的童工、在國内勞工中也佔有相當地位、每天十時至十二時工作只四分、</p>
<p>强迫工作、耐饑餓、簡陋的生活、如上述童工的兒童、再加上了現代的生産利器、這個最年輕的資本家所有的權力、在世界上這樣的擴大着、比較起來、竟使漢人的經濟手段、不能出頭了、在一九三二至三三年中、她有九家大規模的新廠、出産人造絲、他種工業、也進步得使人家不信、無一不得到近代工業的最高利益、下面是她在一九三二至三三各業的平均分析、｜世界各國不景氣的年頭、</p>
<p>工業分類百分數</p>
<p>水泥及紙一二·九</p>
<p>鋼鐵一三·五</p>
<p>機器一五·一</p>
<p>紗廠一八·二</p>
<p>呢羢二三·一</p>
<p>人造絲二四·九</p>
<p>這種分析、並不是她國内市塲所推論出的、她人民購買力的簿弱、只好迫到走挑戰式的傾銷一條路了、在她［十年輸出計劃］中、由政府的資助、籌備着對付世界市塲、的確、現已在煌煌然的發展了、輸出機關成立公會、研究國外市塲的需要、以及各國的關税、推銷部創設要區、竟使全世界受到她驚人低價的打擊、她最近在英國統治領土、如澳洲·新西蘭·海峽殖民地·印度·等處、早有可驚的效果、雖經英國竭力地反對日本貿易的進佔、而她則仍在决絶的進行着、印度棉織物的進口增高五倍、紗綫類高出四倍、</p>
<p>在非洲也有同樣的事蹟、從極南開普敦起日本的推銷員、到處有其踪跡、直至剛果以及亞培新尼亞等地、在一九三三年首七個月中、丹甘葉加（Ｔanganyika）所進口的八七○、○○○碼的人造絲、八○○○、○○○碼是從日本輸出的、至於近東、尤其是伊拉克波斯埃及、日本都有成功的市塲、</p>
<p>英國市塲、是最受損害的、很不容易在這種全力傾銷下掙扎、她提高關税、也只抵住了她的最弱點、倘使再增加其保護税呢、那末倫敦在制止日本低價貨品的要求增進時、日本就要有警告式的照會致英國、説不再買印度或澳洲的棉花、到南美去採辦了、但是自從澳洲的羊毛業和印度的棉花業、因經濟地位的變遷而不景氣後、自願日貨在英國市塲不論售價的推銷、</p>
<p>日本的經營差不多到處一樣的可驚、按東京最近所發表的對外貿易、在一九三二年的統計、就可看到、</p>
<p>市塲百分之增進</p>
<p>亞洲五九·三</p>
<p>歐洲二九·三</p>
<p>北美洲二八·五</p>
<p>中美洲四一·三</p>
<p>南美洲二一·八</p>
<p>非洲九六·二</p>
<p>澳洲七六·九</p>
<p>這是代表平均百份之五十一的增進、同時全世界的商業、也受到這一筆損失、</p>
<p>日本在正在維也納組織一中歐貿易局、那末她的勢力、要侵佔巴爾幹半島·中歐·及南歐·的市塲了、一個大規模的堆棧、在建築着、預備藏棉花·羊毛·絲·人造絲·鋼鐵·橡皮·賽琍珞·磁器·紙貨·以及電燈炮·汽車配件·自由車·等多量的貨物、從此又多了一個推銷的中心、對於他國所最畏的保護税的增高、在舊貨並没有所妨碍、荒蕪的國家、同日本有互换貨物的條件、日本乃没有農産品出口的國家、這又可以比别個工業國多不少利益了、</p>
<p>話又要説回來、日本最後有程序的結果、總不能把她起初的成功做標凖、日本帝國主義者、缺煤和礦産的、這種缺乏、使她最後的孱弱、恰如她輸出過多的結果一樣德意志和英國、永不輸出其全産量的四分之一、美過不過百份之十到十二、日本則已達百分之六十了、這種大規模的進佔世界貿易市塲、實存在着自己摧殘的種子、她的基礎、或者在此情况下破碎、外表的驚人、僅屬於她人民一種最狂疾的功績而已、在政治和軍事上講、日本也有種種困難恐怖着、和美國及蘇聯之間、也已經達到一個嚴重的象徵了、</p>
<p>日本好像一隻鍋鑪、他壓力在不停的上升、十年之内、她人口、從五六、○○○、○○○到六六、○○○、○○○了、賴有政府的帮助、一個很大的工業基礎、已創立着、狂痴般的出口、也在進步着、日本會中止｜將來或者必然的、｜於未曾在她人口過剩的島上、發生社會崩裂之前嗎、她現在武力侵略滿洲、年年一、二○○、○○○、○○○元的軍事防務費用、以及趨於狂醉Ｆascism的倾向、不是表現她上升的景象嗎、日本古諺也説過、［騎在虎背上難跨下的、］</p>

<p>落水渡客共救起卅五人</p>
<p>尚有數人失踪船員解局</p>
<p>昨晨六時許、有往來浦東周家渡一帶之渡船一艘、行至南市高昌廟浦面、爲義泰興碼頭渡在霚因攔腰撞沉、當塲渡船中落水者、有三十餘名、除經水巡隊長警設法救起三十餘名外、餘尚在打撈中、義泰興渡船老大、已經帶隊讯究、茲將此事詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<p>渡船圖利違章</p>
<p>南市浦江、每日往來浦東之渡船甚多、市政府公用局、爲求浦江水上安全計、曾經嚴訂章則、限制渡輪逾額載客、大致較大之船身占八十尺長者、每次載客、至多二十人、其次則限定十六人不等、不得貪利多載、違者嚴懲、此次有往來浦東周家渡及南市高昌廟一帶之湯作發渡船一艘、因貪圖微利、不遵市政府規定人數、從浦東開出時、竟逾限定名額、載運搭客三十餘人、從浦東開出、向浦西高昌廟碼頭行來、搭客中多數爲浦東鄉農到上海呌賣菜蔬者、隨帶重量之筐籃、擠滿船中、</p>
<p>大霧船輪撞碰</p>
<p>該渡船摇到浦江中流、係自東向西而駛、會有義泰興碼頭之渡輪一艘、自江海關碼頭載客一百餘名、向浦東開去、是由北朝南、開往中華碼頭、至相近高昌廟江面、適與湯作發之擺渡船相值、此時天降重霧、江面一片糢糊、湯之渡船自東向西、從旁駛出、義泰興輪又未拉回聲、致彼此均未得知、及至輪·渡·兩船相近、欲使互避、已覺不及、遂致撞碰而釀生巨禍、</p>
<p>渡船沉没江中</p>
<p>湯作發之渡船爲義泰興渡輪、攔腰猛撞、砰然一聲、船上所搭之三十餘名搭客、乃大爲驚恐、當時各人因爭相側讓、致重量失其平均、船受輪撞、已難支持、再加船中各人移動、致不能平行、故立卽覆没、渡船當時下沉、船内之旅客舟子以及菜蔬物件等、亦盡數跌落浦中、一時江面上呼救之聲紛起、至於義泰興渡輪之船頭、則毫無損壞、</p>
<p>水警救援搭客</p>
<p>出事後、市公安局水巡隊得報、急由副隊長李承奎率同巡官潘秀桐帶大隊長警、分乘巡輪、急駛至出事地點會同義泰興渡輪上之老大舟子等、進行打撈旅客及援救落水之人、當塲經水警救起渡客浦東人包公明·周金生·謝蘭英·曹吳氏·俞林英·及渡船老大湯作發·舟子毛瀚海·等、共三十五名、各人因均遭没頂之禍、救起時滿身水淋、卽由水警帶隊詢問後、便卽各遺歸</p>
<p>懲辦肇禍舟子</p>
<p>惟尚有渡客謝友琪等數名、在落水後、未見冒起、或已溺斃、乃由水警李副隊長留長警數名、在該處守候、進行打撈尸體、及調查死者姓名外、當將肇事之義泰興渡輪老大張長林立予捕拿、連同被害之渡船主湯作發、一併帶區隊、預審一道、以湯則違章裝載過量之客、張則肇禍主犯、一併備文送解市公安局訊辦、</p>

<p>三項理由</p>
<p>（一）其部下人云、我等皆馬將軍部下、與馬將軍共患難甚久、出死入生、直到退入俄境、從未相離、後馬將軍在俄境被扣押、生命懸於呼吸、我等一齊到俄國黨局前力爭、聲言如不將馬將軍恢復自由、願求同死、俄當局見部下如此義氣、大爲感動、遂將馬將軍釋放、馬將軍卽與我等相面、且垂涙而道（指馬將軍自言）我生同生、我死同死、誓與諸君共命、及由歐啓程返國、馬將軍仍慷慨而言、此次回國、我有飯吃、諸君亦有飯吃、决不中道相棄、馬將軍對我等如此表决心跡、我等雖在途次備受痛苦、仍若感激涕零、又想回國之後、馬將軍之出處、卽我等之南針、且有以前東北抗日之微勞、在馬將軍領導之下、必有安身立命之所、則途次生命、縱感艱困、亦軍人刻苦本分、從未略有怨言、詎意馬將軍返國後、受中央殊遇、不知奮發有爲、意志不定、進退失據、終至自絶於中央、乃心生危懼、悄然到津、别打主意、部下往見、拒不一面、我等旣以抗日而不能更回東北、又因馬將軍政治認識錯誤、無由爲中央效勞、頓覺有國難投、有家難奔、馬將軍旣忘却同生死共患難之信誓、又因反覆之故、斷送我部下光明之出路、現在我等有裘敝金盡、顚沛流離於各都市者、亦有賣男　女、苟延殘喘者、處境之苦、一言難盡、此馬將軍在人道上良心上、應爲我等設法者一、（二）馬將軍前後收到國内外抗日捐欵、無慮數百萬、而就地徵取者、尚不在内、所收捐欵、從未向衆作具體報告、後由部下請求　佈、如籠統通告共收二百七十萬、（有明令可證）而經滬在青年會報告時、忽又説前後祇收一百二十萬、卽此而論、馬將軍卽欺騙部下、欺騙民衆、又欺騙政府、彼擁有鉅大家私、而對部下之刻簿如此、情太難堪、此馬將軍在人道上良心上應爲我等設法者二、（三）此次馬將軍旣託某某等出而調停、足見馬將軍已覺悟我等與馬將軍追隨日久、出版小紀、以鳴不平本爲不得已之舉、如</p>

<h3 id="c169">讀書問答 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>小小十年中所表現的婚姻問題讀書指導</p>
<p>從看書中我，發生了一個問題，很想請教請教，雖然不是書的本身上的，但這問題由讀書而發，所以我才這樣的提出來，並且我是爲這問題久苦惱的人；我想和我同病的青年，一定也不少，所以希望你們能給與詳細的答復。</p>
<p>原因是這樣，葉永榛先生的小小十年下卷裏寫着，他勇敢的犠牲了那舊式的妻，他那時的心理，寫的很激烈，他寗肯丢了家，親愛的母親，及同床數日的妻，終於飄然的走了，去會他的愛人。</p>
<p>這裏，很感動了我，但頂迷惑住我的是書上不知那位批着（這書是圖書館的，）呸，你固然勇敢的打破這黑暗的，賣買式的婚姻，可是，在對方你那已同床的妻呢？在這句後面又有位不同的人抱不平的批道：放屁！你這妥恊者！他就該丢棄自己的幸福，去趨就黑暗嗎？折衷派！這兩位先生的理論鬥爭，眞迷住了我，因爲我也是像葉先生那樣的環境，但却終於做了折衷派。</p>
<p>因爲我平日很關心這婚姻問題，所以我收集了以上兩家的意見，並加以説明如下：但不知那是對的？</p>
<p>勇敢者，他們以爲新的青年，應該絶不容氣的和環境奮鬥，尤其是婚姻，舊的賣買式的，要不得，不相識的，没愛情的妻，絶對不能和她同居。不管是頑固的父母，封建的社會，總絶不妥恊。</p>
<p>折衷派呢，他們以爲，現在的社會，尚没進步到另一新階段，生在這不幸的階段中的過渡者，雖然應該去推動社會，使走進新的階段，但在婚姻上，仍可以忍耐些，原因這資本主義的社會下，一切都商品化，就連婦女都在内，所以講戀愛而結婚的人，大半，終結要失戀，而至離婚，尤其是這金錢人慾横流的都市裏，那一個摩登女子，會有眞摯的愛情。倒不如妥恊一下，娶個鄉下女子，也許能很甜蜜的過着結婚的生活。這種心理的青年很多，我從前在初中裏，一級學生有三分之二已結婚，完全是舊式，也有很不錯的，壞的也有，我就是一個。</p>
<p>先生，這兩個絶不相同的議論，很困惑了我，也許還有許多青年吧！</p>
<p>結婚，是終身大事，我雖然已經錯了，但我希望能得一個正確的解答，使以後的青年，不致踏了我的故轍。（濟南劉渶雲來信）</p>

<p>一·退欵之動機</p>
<p>民國十四年十月和蘭政府爲增進中和兩國親善計曾派和使面致節略於北京政府、表示願將和國部分庚欵餘額退還、專用於有利益於中國之事業、且感於黃河水災重爲鉅患、擬將和庚欵充作治理黃河之用、並延用利蘭水利工程師、相與籌劃、以除中國歷史上人民所受無量之大害、北京政府旋卽表示感謝、只因政變頻仍、此案終未决定、</p>
<p>二·退欵之成熟時期</p>
<p>至二十二年四年四月、我國政府始與和蘭駐華公使换文、决將自民國十五年（一九二六年）一月一日起應付和國之庚欵全數退還我國、指定用於中國水利事業及補助文化機關。</p>
<p>三·中和换文恊定</p>
<p>關於和庚欵用途、該换文規定甚詳、其中最顯明者爲（一）交還之欵應以百分之六十五用於中國水利事業、其餘百分之三十五、則借作文化事業之用途、</p>
<p>四·退欵總額</p>
<p>計和金三百零六萬六千零五佛樂林二八九、</p>
<p>五·撥充教育文化事業經費之數目</p>
<p>關於供作文化用途之百分三十五、應卽由一九二六年（卽民國十五年）一月一日以來所積存現歸和蘭政府保管之欵項撥出四十萬盾、作爲文化基金、此項基金應交由中國派駐海牙之外交代表及和蘭阿姆新得達姆皇家科學院文學院院長與歷頓大學校長所組織之董事會保管處理之、爲增進中和文化關係計、文化基金每年所得利息之百分之五十三、應交與中國中央研究院、由中央研究院以其年息五十三十三作爲該院事業補助費、五十三分之四十作爲派遣中國學者及學生留學和蘭之經費、但其比例於必要時亦可變更、又文化基金所得年息之其餘百分之四十七、每年贈與和蘭歷頓大學之漢學研究院、</p>
<p>六·和庚欵董事會之組織</p>
<p>和庚欵董事會名爲中和庚欵水利事業董事會、本會組織、極爲簡單僅由中國國民政府簡派中國董事兩人、和籍董事一人組織之、並就中指定一人爲董事長、歸行政院管轄、</p>
<p>七·現任董事人選</p>
<p>中國方面爲石瑛、孫輔世、和蘭方面爲赫龍門、石瑛兼董事長、</p>
<p>八·最近和庚欵支配狀况</p>
<p>和庚欵因爲退還未久、尚未支配、（完）</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>當時在路上保護伊的，便是榮祿。在慈禧没有給咸豐　去做妃子以前，勞祿就是伊的情人，後來榮祿仍克盡厥　的做伊的忠僕。他們兩人中間的一番戀愛，却就此很沉痛地犠牲了。</p>
<p>到如今，差不多已過了半世紀了，伊自己也已經給人家尊爲皇太后了；榮祿是死了，伊所愛着的兒子｜同治，也早已不在了。所剩的祇是一個最奸滑的李蓮英，依舊伴着伊，從這同一道路上，再到伊的發祥地｜熱河去。</p>
<p>離開紫金城，｜那個充滿着野心的地方｜一步一步的遠了，皇太后的一大隊人馬，不住的在這條黃沙路上前進着：但是五十年前的人馬的蹤跡，已像過眼烟雲一般的不可再見了。</p>
<p>前進，前進，越過了那些綠色的山頭，偶然在幾處預先佈置好的廟宇裏歇息一會，：：：接着，又繼續前進。這一隊美麗的行列，終於是在熱河行宫前的那片大空地上紥下了。這裏的一切，都是靜止得像死的一樣！</p>

<p>可惜這種偉大的計劃，僅止於高唱入雲，而並没眞反電車高架入雲，這自然是使人大失所望的。</p>

<p>國際和平公约墨跡未乾，各國對於未來的二次世界大戰，已無不處心積慮，積極凖備；大陸國如法意美俄等均集中力量，以發展其陸地與空間的權威，而英國爲保持其海軍覇主的光榮，故無時不在謀以新的方法，統率海軍。</p>
<p>英國海軍專家，欲利用無綫電，在相當距離之外，控制其戰艦，使其行動，悉聽號令指揮，不特如此，在戰爭時，艦上一切開槍轟礮施放水雷以及燃燒烟幕彈種種工作，無不以無綫電控制之，無需一兵一卒，此項夢想，自一九二五年始，無時不在繼續試騐，至今已大告成功。</p>
<p>無綫電遥遠探制的原理，雖極簡單，然設備極爲複雜，從控制站用確定的波長，發出一訊號，（一如無綫電報的發報裝置），被控制的戰艦上，預先設有極靈敏的收音裝置，且已配諧至控制訊號的波長，當收得此項訊號時，收音機輸出的電流，起一微弱的跳動，由是可以啓動一相應的繼電器，每個繼電器的閉合，可影響駕駛羅盤，使戰艦向某一符合的方向駛行，而各繼電器的動作，完全可以不同的訊號控制之。</p>
<p>控制戰艦的駛行，猶稱易事，最難者，莫如控制戰艦上軍器的使用，如裝彈，瞄凖等工作（此項工作，在不久的將來，或將以無綫電傳影爲之），經長時間的實騐，現已發明一種比較簡單的機械，可使瞄凖極有效，先在一飛機上，裝設二塊圓形的透明薄片，每片均分成若干度數，且均註有號數，同時在被控制的戰艦上，亦設有同樣度數及號數的表軌。偵察者在飛機上，透過此圓片向下面轟擊的目標注視，設敵艦發現於圓片上的某一度，今假定爲四，彼立卽登一訊［四］至控制艦，控制艦卽以無綫電校配戰艦上的表軌使亦爲四，同時卽發礮，此時飛機上的偵察者，須注意此礮彈的落點，如離敵艦甚近，則經過圓片可察得有水花發現於相隣的號數，設爲五，立卽再發一訊號［五］至控制艦，於是控制艦再用無綫電控制戰艦上的表軌，使礮彈的射程適度，如偵察機直接控制戰艦，尤可迅速。</p>
<p>將來戰爭時，一大隊的軍艦，可在一極輕便迅速的小艘上，用無綫電控制，之使一切行動。悉聽指揮者的號令。</p>

<p>低週率放大（ＡudioＦrequencyＡmplification）在以揚聲器放音之較大收音機中，實佔重要部份，其對於全機效率之影響頗大，尤其是收音機輸出的音量，及音質方面，其優劣全繫於低週率放大級，故設計一收音機時，斯實首要。然初步無綫電研究者，每因不明各式低放配合之特點，及裝置不當，致難獲優良的成績。作者有鑒於斯，不揣膚淺，爰就普通使用之各式低週率放大配合法，簡爲解釋，俾初學同志，有所借鏡焉。</p>
<p>（圖一）</p>
<p>（一）變壓器配合放大（圖一）（ＴransformerＣouplingAmplification）此式配合放大，最爲普遍，蓋其僅用小量之電力，而能得高倍之音最也。惟當其與强力輸出管結合時，因Ｂ電壓增高，致每易引起失眞，苟能設計週全｜如糾正隔極電壓，及加分路儲電器等，｜亦可减少失眞度。</p>
<p>（圖二）</p>
<p>（二）電阻交連配合放大（ＲesistanceＣouplingAmplification）（圖二）此式放大器，乃由無感電阻器（ＮonindnctiveResistance）連以固定電容器而成，因該種電阻，於任何週率時，均能保持其常數，故雖用於高級放大，及末級强放中，其輸出仍能毫不不失眞，其音質之優美清浙，遠非變壓器放大者，所能比擬。</p>
<p>（圖三）</p>
<p>（三）推挽式放大（ＰushＰullＡmplifier）（圖三）欲使音音强大，音質優美而不失眞實捨此式莫屬，一般大電力之收音機，及拾音器，頗多採用此式者。惟以耗電過大，普通小規模收音機，都不甚採用。且自五極强力管發明後，一般研究者，均認爲一級成音週率强放，已够享用云。</p>
<p>上述三式低週率放大配合法，最爲通行，此外尚有（ＬoftinＷbite）直接配合放大，及變壓器電阻結連放大等等，因限於篇幅，俟他日再爲讀者詳述之。</p>

<p>— 一知</p>
<p>整流管在普通整流綫路上，用半波式或全波式以整流，祇能增减其顫動電流，而不能使輸出的直流電壓較整流前供給於屏極上交流電壓增高一倍，現在若採用特殊綫路，卽能産生直流電壓恰爲原來交流電壓的兩倍，這種接法，就呌整流器倍壓法。</p>
<p>第一圖</p>
<p>第一圖以半波整流管接成倍壓法，</p>
<p>倘用三極管以代替之，則栅極須與屏極並聯；如用８０．８２等全波整流管，則兩屏極須並聯之，這整流器若輸入的交流電壓爲１１０Ｖ則輸出的直流電壓可得２４０Ｖ左右。</p>
<p>第二圖</p>
<p>第二圖爲２５Ｚ５倍壓整流管的倍壓接法。</p>
<p>倍壓法的原理，以第二圖解之，較易明瞭，因此管的兩屏極有兩電容器Ｃ１Ｃ２爲之跨接交替，所以利用其變换正負極性，仿如兩半波聯在一起，當屏極Ｐ１在整流時，跨接於屏極Ｐ２的電容器Ｃ１適值放電，故輪出的直流電壓爲整流屏極的屏壓與電容器放電電壓的和，恰爲原來輸入交流電壓的兩倍。</p>
<p>濾波器的裝置與平常無異，Ｃ１Ｃ２Ｃ３爲四兆分法拉濾波電容器，須耐高壓至　００Ｖ　　圈爲３０亨利，輸出直流電壓上可接分壓電阻器，以調　適當的電壓。</p>
<p>（附註）使用此種倍壓法整流器的收音機，而屏壓的交流電源直接取於火綫上者，卽不用昇高變壓器的，若接地綫，須與陰極串接一兆分法拉耐高壓電容器一只，以免整流管發生短路而致損壞。</p>
<h3 id="c216">阻流圈與電容器 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 石華鑫</p>
<p>阻流圈與電容器爲交流電源無綫電機的重要部分。它的職務是濾去整流後直流電的顫動（Ｒipple），變成極純粹的直流。所以兩者在整流器中，稱爲濾波段。</p>
<p>阻流圈是和普通的綫圈相同，不過整流器中所用的，誘導率要很大，｜｜约三十亨利。所以中心都是用鐵心的。在上等的阻流圈中，</p>
<p>（一）應有空隙，（Ａirgap），因爲它的的誘導率，要比同樣没有空隙的大許多。</p>
<p>（二）直流電阻要小，否則電流通過時，降壓過大，輸出電壓降低不少，雖然可以增加整流部分輸一電壓，以資補救，可是往往因整流管的關係，不能過分加高，以致影響成績。</p>
<p>然而在用電動揚聲器的收音機上，爲簡便起見，就用勵磁圈代替阻流圈，也很適合，不過勵磁圈的阻力很大，因而降壓亦大，設計時要加高整流部分輸出電壓。</p>
<p>阻流圈在使用時，大半接在正極方面，不過接在負極方面時，效力仍然很好。</p>
<p>用在這部分的電容器，第一，耐電壓要高，第二，電容量要大，再下去便要價格低。普通有下列三種，各有利弊，如果配得適當，效果是差不多的。</p>
<p>一，雲母片絶緣電容器，它能耐的電壓很高，用來擔任濾波工作，非常適宜。不過價值極高，非我輩業餘家所能購置。</p>
<p>二，電液電容器，它所佔的地位很小，可節省收音機的容積。不過耐電壓不高，約四百弗打左右，所以用於電壓高於四百弗打時，必須多用幾只串接之。例如串接同容量的兩只，耐電壓卽爲八百弗打，而電容量只有每只的二分之一。如果配置適宜時，價值不貴，收效甚大。至於壽命方面，據製造者説，可用八九年，但是普通均因受過高電壓而損壞。此種電容器，接綫時有正負之分，用時要注意。</p>
<p>三，電糊電容器，此種電容器價值最便宜，耐電壓亦低，約爲二百餘弗打。在小型收音機中使用，非常合宜，亦可同電液電容器一樣，串接起來應用。壽命方面據説只有一二年，照鄙人用過的結果，倘使電壓不超過規定，一樣可以用好幾年。此式電容器在舶來品收音機電源部分，用得不多。、普通都用電液式電容器。最大的用處，是作傍路電容器用的，如與電阻並聯，以代丙電等。</p>

<p>— 冰一</p>
<p>業餘家研究無綫電，當以興趣和經濟爲趨向，所以在玩弄交流機時，所需要的電源變壓器，多喜歡自己製造，但在繞這樣小變壓器時，極應注意到下述幾點，使牠的效率（Ｅfficirncy）可以高，同時也很耐用。</p>
<p>（一）設計凖確關於設計方面，本刋及他種雜誌都有詳細的指導，不容　述，不過設計時應注意到繞綫表上鐵心所適用的週率，是否是本地電源的週率，譬如表上所書明的是適用於６０Ｃycle的，而本地週率是２５Ｃycle，那末鐵心面積就要加大到２．１到２．２倍才够，或是每伏脱圈數（Ｔurnspervolt）加多，不過電燈發電機很少用在５０cycle之下的。</p>
<p>（二）擇綫凖確電源方棚内所繞之綫多係漆包，取其價廉而體積小，通常市上所售有ＳＷＧ（英國標凖）及Ｂ　Ｓ（美國標凖）兩種。同一號數的兩種綫，所載電流就有大小。英國標凖ＮＯ．２０漆包綫，與美園標凖Ｎo１９漆包綫，所載電流量恰是一樣。英國的３０號綫相當美國的２８號綫，所以買綫時應適合於表上所用的那一種標凖，於經濟上，地位上，及耐用上，不致有某一方面的损失。（待續）</p>

<p>— 宓子章</p>
<p>近五六年來的外國電影，是先給我們看了一通洋俠客的勇敢，於是而野蠻人的陋劣，又於是而洋小姐的曲綫美。但是，眼界是要大起來的，終於幾條腿不够了，於是一大　；又不够了，於是赤條條。這就是［裸體運動大寫眞］，雖然是正正堂堂的［人體美與健康美的表現］，然而又是［小童擋駕］的，他們不配看這些［美］。</p>
<p>爲什麽呢？宣傳上有這樣的文字｜｜</p>
<p>［一個極頂聰明的孩子説：她們怎不回過身子兒來呢？］</p>
<p>［一位十足嚴正的爸爸説：怪不得戲院對孩子們要擋駕了！］</p>
<p>這當然只是文學家虚擬的妙文，因爲這影片是一開始就標榜着［小童擋駕］的，他們無從看見。但假使眞給他們去看了，他們就會這樣的質問嗎？我想，也許會的。然而這質問的意思，恐怕和張生唱的［咍，怎不回過臉兒來］完全兩樣，其實倒在電影中人的態度的不自然，使他覺得奇怪。中國的兒童也許比較的早熟，也許性感比較的敏，但總不至於比成年的他的［爸爸］，心地更不乾凈的。倘其如此，二十年後的中國社會，那可眞眞可怕了，但事實上大槪决不至於此，所以那答話還不如改一下：</p>
<p>［因爲要使我過不了癮，可惡極了！］</p>
<p>不過肯這樣説的［爸爸］恐怕也未必有。他總要［以己之心，度人之心］，度了之後，便將這心硬塞在别人的腔子裏，裝作不是自己的，而説别人的心没有他的乾凈。裸體女人的都［不回過身子兒來］，其實是專爲對付這類人物的。她們難道是白痴，連［爸爸］的眼色，比他孩子的更不規矩都不知道嗎？</p>
<p>但是，中國社會還是［爸爸］類的社會，所以做起戲來，是［媽媽］類獻身，［兒子］類受謗。卽使到了緊要關頭，也還是什麽［木蘭從軍］，［汪踦衛國］，要推出［女子與小人］去搪塞的。［吾國民其何以善其後　？］</p>

<p>劉達生論［做官與做戲］云：［世間極認眞事曰做官，極虚幻事曰做戲。而弟竊愚甚。每於塲中見歌哭笑駡，打　插科，便確認爲眞。眞不在所打扮古人，而在此扮古人之戲子，一一具有父母妻兒，一一俱要養家活口，一一俱以哭笑打　養父母，活妻兒，此戲子乃眞古人也。又每自于頂冠束帶，妝模做樣之際，確然自道一眞官，天下亦無一人疑我爲戲子者。正不知打恭看坐，懽容笑口，與夫作色正容，凛莫敢犯之官人，實卽此養家活口，做哭做笑之古人耳。乃拿定一戲塲，戲具，戲本，戲腔，至五臟六腑，全爲戲用，而自亦不覺爲眞戲子，悲夫！］揭穿西洋景，抓破假面皮，不知今之官僚讀之，遍身皮膚，將起何種的感覺也，達生無乃太惡劣乎？一笑！</p>
<p>（十九）</p>
<p>文人每多奇想，其窮者往往更别開生面，完全的不合理化。如前述以自然充畫餅，卽其一例；唐宜之論缸，亦是絶妙好文，他説：［病骨飄零，绝無歸處，且寄身孤寺。寺中有床而無被，旅中有被而無帳。今向僧求借一魚缸，晝夜坐臥其中，友儕憐而止我，時戒以勿言。假使昔人以缸爲床，則我今日有床而無缸，諸君又當憐我無缸矣。有床乃知無帳之苦，無床何所求於帳哉？幸評此况，較文字如何也？］此種推想，雖不是異想天開，然亦虧他想得出。</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>原來白話文的興起，受西洋文學的影響非常之多；因此白話文的文句，變成複雜的結構，常有很多的形容詞，形容詞短语，副詞，副詞短語，（所謂歐化文）如郭沫若譯歌德［少年維持之煩惱］，中有一句：</p>
<p>［當那秀美的山谷在我周圍蒸騰，杲杲的太陽照在濃蔭没破的森林上，只有二三光綫偷入林内的聖地時，我便睡在溪旁的深草上，地上千萬種的細草更帖近地爲我所注意：我的心上更帖切地感覺着草間小世界的嗡營，那不可數，不可窮狀的種種昆虫蚊呐，而我便感覺着那全能者底存在；他依着他的形態造成了我們的；我便感覺着那全仁者底呼息，他支持我們漂浮在這永恒底歡樂之中的。］</p>
<p>全句凡百五十八字，第一個副詞短語（從［當］［時］）就有四十二字，中間又包含三個短句，每個短句又包含許多［詞］及［短語］。這樣複雜的結構，乃是從前文言文所没有的。歐洲的文學中，原不一定都採取這樣複雜結構的體制，如小泉八雲所引的一段北歐叙事文，七百五十個詞語中，只有十個表容詞；但在英國及南歐諸國文體中，複雜的結構則是常見的。（伍光建譯大仲馬［俠隠記］爲文言，就删了許許多子句，或把複合句拉直。）白話文受了歐化，將文句變成非常複雜，我們應該承認是一種進步的現狀。</p>
<p>其實，現代文繁複，古代文簡單，從所使用的工具和所描寫的對象上看，也是勢所必然的。章實齋云：［古人作書，漆文竹簡，或著　帛，或以刀削，繁重不勝，是以文辭簡嚴，章無賸句，句無賸字；良由文字艱難，故不得已而作書，取足達意而止，非第不屑爲冗長，且亦無睱爲冗長也。自然紙筆作書，其便易十倍於竹帛刀漆；而文之繁冗蕪蔓，亦遂隨其人所欲爲。雖世風文質固有轉移，而人情於所輕便，則易於恣放，捷其繁重，則自出謹嚴，亦其常也。］（乙卯剳記）他已指明工具與文體的關連；現在機械工業勃興，工具供結，其便趨十百倍於乾嘉年間，文體恣放，勢所必至。文言文中，如王安石萬言書，已算洋洋大觀？今人行文，如梁啓超爲蔣百里［文藝復興史］作序文，一寫就是六七萬言，眞是古人夢想所不及的。舊時文人，生長在鄉村農業社會，過樸素的有閑生活：其所寫取的對象，如大自然，小都市，都是變化很少的。着筆之初，從容考量；寫成之後，從容修正：可以這樣做細磨細琢的功夫，使文章顯得十分簡鍊。現在工業社會所造成的大都市，生活太繁複，變化太急　。舊時形容都市的擁擠，説是車如流水馬如龍］，用以形容今日之上海街頭，已嫌不十分切貼。舊時形容晚景，説是［萬家燈火］，今日［尹紅］彩網的上海夜色，豈是［萬家燈火］所能形容。昔日狀物之詞句旣窮於使用，形容詞，副詞之多量增加，乃是時勢怕必然産生的。今日大都市的文人，墨方着紙，稿已付排，全無周旋之餘地：從事新聞事業的，有時連考量的餘裕也没有：詞句支蔓，更爲事實上所必有。所以詞句之冗長，謂爲白话文的短處固可，謂爲白話文的長處亦無不可，是非尚難斷言也。（未完）</p>

<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>｜無窗室　筆之三｜</p>
<p>昨天，我對一個村間的小學校長提到了一個很紅的女明星，他摇摇頭，説：</p>
<p>［不知道］！</p>
<p>我没有説什麽，大槪臉色上有了表情，他很辣狠的來了一句：［怎麽，太陋了吧］？</p>
<p>［太陋了吧］。這一句打動了，我很不好受，因而從這裏邊尋出了一些更多的東西來。</p>
<p>你如果對一個鄉下人講跳舞廳中飄飄的人影，銀幕上有人在活動而且會説話，他（或她）會驚異的像聽天書，你對他説在都市裏一頓飯花到幾十塊錢，他一定伸一下舌頭。</p>
<p>鄉村的人們，在經濟破産和急流裏留不住的漩沙一樣的今天，在窮苦中掙扎着一條命，深　　　撑着　　　　嚴　　　只一條單褲和北風苦鬥。此外什麽也到不了他們的心裏。　　住在都市裏的人，只能拿着鄉村破産當做一個名詞，你問他破到個什麽樣子，如果他是坦白的話一定回答一句：［不知道］</p>
<p>記得自己在學校的高樓中，冬夜無聊的時候，呼工友倒一　清茶，於是，紅的爐火，大家便圍起來了，每人躺在一把安東椅上，口裏吸上一根香烟，各種議論便悠悠的從烟縷上冒出來了。你贊成這樣主義，我同情那種［司蒂］，彼此儼然成了敵人，起初還小噪辯論，後來簡直紅着臉大拍桌子，各人好似口頭戰勝了，他那主義或［司蒂］便立刻可以實現。結果，弄得大家都失眠。</p>
<p>這是一種口頭主義。飯後茶餘的消遣［司蒂］。你追問鄉村的現况倒底是個什麽樣，怕谁都［不知道］　　不但大學生這樣。目下寫鄉村破産的作品很多，你如果是一個道地鄉下人，那三句話便會塞住了那個作家的口！因爲他所寫的是在超然地位中想像或觀察來的。</p>
<p>一般人高唱救濟農村然而一邊唱一邊不防做一些更促進破産速度的事。他們眼中鄉村破産是在統計的數目字上，問他們眞實的情形，也是：</p>
<p>［不知道］。</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>慢慢走着的隊伍，終於走完了維新街，走上河南街。這是全城最熱閙的一條街，平素就有着數不清的行人，這時更是人山人海，斷絶了交通。我就不明白這些人究竟是看什麽熱閙！不，他們大槪是在看女學生。女學生，一向就成爲他們這種優閑的順民賞玩品評的對象。當然他們不願放棄這一瞬間難得的權利。</p>
<p>分明地，我聽到路旁有人批評我們隊伍中的人：</p>
<p>［那小傢伙長的眞好，眼睛多麽活］。</p>
<p>［粗腿肚那一個也不錯呀，你的眼光才不行］。</p>
<p>［不對，還是那個穿漆皮鞋的好，楊柳細腰好風騷］。</p>
<p>同時還聽到有人駡着痛心的話：</p>
<p>［樂個蛋，好體面的亡國奴］！</p>
<p>［有什麽看的，越看越生氣，給日本人討好去］！</p>
<p>［唉！日子過的眞快，快有兩年了］。</p>
<p>聽這類話，把我先時一肚子的憤慨都變成悲傷了，但我從此却明顯地看出：人心還没有死盡。總有一天，大羣的被壓迫的奴才會翻身的。</p>
<p>所有街上的洋車，馬車，都躱在街旁邊一動不能動，警察儘在驅逐着衣冠不整的人羣。很順利地，不一會工夫，隊伍就走到了運動塲。</p>
<p>運動塲的人比街上的人更多，大門上高高地貼着二十個大字：</p>
<p>［一九·一八二週紀念九·一五承認一週紀念慶祝大會］。</p>
<p>警察，憲兵不住地排退擁塞的觀衆，我們的隊伍，從容地走進了運動塲的大門。</p>
<p>軍樂隊發狂般地奏着樂，不知是慶祝我們的到塲呢，還是贊美我們的服從命令。不一會，一師，一中，一工，縣中，助産，市小，縣小的學生也都來到了，如果把今天的情况和二年前一這裏開着的盛會比較一下，不同的地方，祇是現在塲裏的一角上，添出一帮新客，那就是日本同文商業學校的學生和日本尋常小學的學生，從前，是没有他們這些學生來參與盛會的。還有一種相反的事實，在塲裏顯露着：當各校隊伍排列在一定的位置之後，便可看到在日本學生的隊伍裏，小國旗不住地舞着，人都是精神飽滿地表示出過分的快樂，跳着，呌着，笑着。而我們這帮亡國奴的學生，則不管中學生和小學生，差不多都是垂頭喪氣地呆呆地站着，想着，不跳，不呌，也不哭，像一羣偶像似的。</p>
<p>這樣的現象是難得的，至少，這些學生們還没有忘記到自身的恥辱，但是，單單地消極地悲傷，有什麽用處呢？</p>
<p>天熱起來，秋天的太陽，晒的人别有一種難當的地方，又加上四圍看熱閙的人，男的，女的，擠的連出一口大氣都像很費力的。吵閙的情形，不似行將開會的會塲，倒像是唱野台戲的露天劇塲。一會，孩子哭了，一會有人駡起來，一會又有人作着怪聲，他們來此的情緻，可以説和四月二十八日去北山廟會差不多的，所不同的，他們也許還有藏在内心裏的小小　望，就是　此　仰一下貴官要人的豐采的。</p>

<p>農家一石米歷盡千辛愁</p>
<p>换得血汗錢能有幾多收</p>
<p>正爲斛司小費之减少一問題，發生了停斛事態，於昨已有兩日，不禁聯想到農家一石米來滬　賣的種種費用，鄉農費盡了千辛萬苦手足　　的勞力，栽種成的米穀，却不料爲糶賣，受着了不少損失，這是何等若痛呀！</p>
<p>爲了不能直接去找消费者，不得不投行買賣，行家爲了代他出售的緣故，從中酌收佣金，均還説得過去，至於其他一切，雖則説是都經行家手裏付出去的，可是這筆錢，不是行家的，羊毛出在羊身上，歸根終是賣户損失，賣户卽是最後的負擔者｜鄉農。</p>
<p>不言别處，單就内地販米來上海的説，一石米所有的外費有如下列：</p>
<p>（一）水脚一角五分此係平均约數實際有少至一角一二多至一角七八。</p>
<p>（二）斛力二十四文此係行家發斛司的力金，實際也出於賣户的小帳三分此係賣户付與斛司的一種小費，現在竟然公開了。</p>
<p>（三）貼車三分半此係自米船上肩負至碼頭上車之一種小費，張袋十文此係行家給與小工之用，</p>
<p>（四）回船五百六十八文此係船户將米斛卸清楚後行家所給與之回　錢，以一船計算，姑以每船載二百石論，每石合三文之數，</p>
<p>（五）經售五分卽經售商，係從賣户手中貨向行家抖賣者也，從中取佣，</p>
<p>（六）行佣二角此係行家所收之佣錢，但以其中六分貼還於米店，作爲裝卸等費，又除去雜費約一分許，行家實收當在一角三分左右。</p>
<p>（七）耗米二升此係賣户以米一石交於船户來滬銷售，除給以水脚费外，尚須爲船户扣去每石一升或二升之耗米，卽實則賣户一石米，祗九八折收取價銀也，此二升米如照現在米價計算，已有一角六分，若米價愈高，卽其所得亦愈大。</p>
<p>此外尚有公所捐，常帮爲二文，南帮爲七文，卽上述諸種費用，一爲計算，已在六角四分之　，此皆農民之损失，而亦消費者所增之負擔也。</p>
<p>若與三十年前相較，（以洋價每元作千文計算），當時每石之費用如下：</p>
<p>行佣七分斛力四文斛司小帳一分駁力一分二厘經售一分</p>
<p>雖則尚有水脚等等，較之目前，相差多了。</p>
<p>是以鄉農一石米，加以錢糧　子，地方捐税，照現在的米價，能有多少收得，救濟農村，　助農民，總要有切實的功夫做去才好。</p>

<h3 id="c263">各個擊破 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>山雨欲來風滿城，日來日本軍閥爲應付明後年危局，力謀打開難關，竟與［滿蒙］的鋒鏑齊進，而實行外交［總動員］了。在這一目標之下，説對於關係各國積極工作，明瞭國内情勢及了解日本政府方針，已設法召回中美法等國使臣回國，面授機宜，據云這一刷新外交的方針，具有阻止華府會議列國聯合對日與進行承認傀儡的單獨談判的意義，因而名之曰：［各個擊破策略］。其原則之進行，以一九三六年前各國先承認僞組織爲前提。</p>
<p>各個擊破，這顯然在日本是一個新的政策，因爲我們現在正在歡喜已博得世界的同情，宣稱日本外交已陷於孤立。尤其是扭着一紙不承僞組織的决議與甚麽恊定，便早已安心放心，［掩耳不聞天下事，閉門專讀古人書］了。其具有酷好和平之本心與息事寗人之主旨，這且不在話下，再説木展朋友的這一各個擊破策略，其實現是否可能呢？</p>
<p>這一問題的答復是肯定同時也是否定的。我們之所以肯定，因爲處在這大戰前夜彼此忙於備戰的現在，列强反日陣確能在廣田外交下遭受［各個擊破］。各列强能坐視日本的膨脹獨霸遠東麽？當然不，不過各有心事。大英帝國生産機關的老大，使在商議上不能與後起之秀的美國競爭，因之不但在拉丁美洲，與美國有莫大矛盾，而且他在世界範圍内的殖民地也漸起着［離心力］。這一老邁心理，使牠想戰爭，也害怕戰爭，雖然看見日本攫了滿洲眼紅，在［勉維現狀］之下，可能遭日本的［各個擊破］：而美國也因海軍大建設計劃未完成，與在世界範圍上，與英國有絶大的衝突，爲鞏固拉丁美洲的勢力及預備遠東問題的總解决，也暫時需要美日關係的［轉换］。至於法國，牠在遠東的經濟地位和軍事力量，都以英美日在太平洋的［公平處置］和［友好關係］來維持，不會使日本的政策感到掣肘的，再如意德諸國，更其鞭長莫及｜所以就大部份説來，可能實現［各個擊破］的政策。</p>
<p>再説否定的意義又是甚麽呢？就是各國的暫時能受日本［擊破］，不過是爲了再加緊對於戰爭的凖備，在重分市塲的戰爭爆發時，恐未能達到這一政策的終極目的。因爲很顯然，若爲爭奪市塲而發生遠東戰爭，自然是爲分割這地大物博古國的伙併，由於獨佔滿蒙經濟而引起各列强的衝突則現時［各個擊破］的法寳，恐怕就未能　事。</p>
<p>不過在這兒木屐朋友有他聰明的地方，他會以進攻赤色怪物先鋒自任，來獲取各國對於［滿蒙］的承認，也用此來借題發揮，以達到　捲華北的目的。這大槪就是廣田高唱合理外交，［各個擊破］之時，華北情形反而危急的原因了。某晚報載中委張繼談：華北危機四伏，北平大有朝不保夕之虞，與［九一八］前東北情形相似，認爲作亡國奴之日，已在眼前，就是事實。</p>
<p>巴黎清議報説，［日對中國無所忌憚，蓋自一九三三年六月華北停戰後，日本深信中日諒解，不難見諸實現］，不知這一諒解是我們在［外交總動員］下被［各個擊破］呢，還是另有所指的事實，那就有待於我拭目以觀其後了。</p>

<p>— 青木</p>
<p>在黑暗的深夜裏，東方還没有十分吐出魚白色微光的時候，隔院報曉的雄鷄，已不住的引頸長啼：驚醒了朦朧中的我。當時還懶洋洋地仍入睡鄉，但是牠們更提高了聲浪警告我似的狂唤：［遊子，快醒罷！難道你忘却了祇有今天一天的勾留麽？江干望錢塘落日的美景，你還没見過哩，倘在失掉了今天的機會，下次是不可期的啊！］</p>
<p>我乘了吃煤塊的怪東西到江干，直到夕陽西下，我老坐在六和塔上遠眺。呀！恐怕隨便那一處風景好的地方，總比不上此地的清幽出世。那一帶接連水面上青螺似的小山，那天水交界處的幾點歸帆，那同處女眼波似的盈盈的微浪，都足以消失我塵懷。在這樣無限美景的夕陽裏，在這樣大自然的懷抱裏，我忘掉了前途黑暗的一切。</p>
<p>那錢江落日的美景，牠的美妙没有一處不像一個絶代的美人。那輕輕描着的幾痕遠山，不像美人秀黛的眉峯嗎？那西天片片玫瑰似的雲霞，不像美艶嬌羞時緋紅的雙頰嗎？那風吹波浪，美妙的餘音，不也像美人嚦嚦的珠喉嗎？那幾葉臨風的歸帆，又似美人行走時的那種輕盈飄逸的姿態。這黃昏時的景色，愈變愈美的了。一輪紅日，已半入江心，四周環繞的山峯，已隠約莫辨，波上流動的金光，似萬條游泳的金蛇；也似天空中無數閃爍的流星。恐怕就是Ｍuse再世，也不能形容牠美妙於萬一。</p>
<p>歸舟點點，都海鷗似的起伏在微波之中。船上懷春的少女，都嘹着她們清脆的歌喉，且歌且蕩的唱着那自由戀愛的歌兒。她們眞是塵世的神仙，不管朝朝暮暮，在那綠水柔波之中，任她們怎樣親愛歡樂，不會有人知道和干涉。可惜我爲什麽不生長在這裏，做一個漁家郎，而偏生在這茫茫俗世中呢！</p>

<h3 id="c266">［裸體運動］的眞義 <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>轉動着，轉動着，這時代的輪子。人是［喜新厭舊］的動物，從裸體到樹葉子遮身，從懂得遮身一步步的進化上去，一直達到了裹着整個的肉體僅露出手和臉爲止。［穿衣］似乎玩得厭了，長的　到短　　　　　　化到長的，女人更是［一季三翻］，一年的衣裳不知要翻　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　的一件已不適用了。［物達窮境］，翻的也足够了，于是再退化下去，逐漸的有人提倡［返回原始］的赤裸了！</p>
<p>［赤裸］兩字多麽動人，全夥兒脱得赤條條的［一絲不掛］，你看我，我看你，渾身的暴露，女人一向認爲［神秘的奶了］，［不可思議的生殖器］，在這當兒，［不顧一切］的全部赤裸了！也好，眞的回到如此的情况，［階級觀念］要少分些了，走在路上總不會有人看她是一個小姐的身份，或她是一副丫頭的模樣；誰又能辨明［ＸＸ是財主］，或［ＸＸ是一個［食不能飽］的窮漢子］呢！説句俏皮話，巡捕先生的驚棍，施展的當兒可要小心些，莫誤觸了［不可侵犯］的貴人。</p>
<p>話雖這般説，當眞有了這樣的事實後，聰明的［超人］們又會另想出别種花樣來了，身份終究是要分的，［魚目混珠］總不是事，於是再由裸體翻到别種花樣，結末的一句，［回到自然］還不是一個資産階級的時髦玩意兒罷了！</p>
<p>假如認清［回到自然］的眞意義的話，像誘惑式的廣告早有人加以鄙視了，果眞似廣告所謂，不是和化錢看神秘的春宫一樣麽？拿［裸體運動］當新鮮玩意兒，拿牠當肉體的展覽。必然性的，在這閙着濃郁的色情狂的大都會裏，［公開肉體］正是一貼合時的［興奮劑］，投機者利用了這機會，便大事宣傳，出奇的超過［内容所有］，而觀衆也甘願化送了相當的代價，换得了短時間的［目慾的滿足］，尤甚者當然是［春心勃勃］的青年，在看了惑人的廣告文句後，不期然的［心摇神蕩］，而給［生殖器公開］的幾個觸目大字混淆過了！</p>
<p>這就所謂當今［裸體運動］的眞義一部分的反映，這印象終究是一個可怕的印象，纏错了目標，模糊了眼光，迷惑了意志，麻木了其他的一切。</p>
<p>確是時代的輪子在轉，三年前的中國影片上如果提到了［裸體宣傳］，想該早就查禁了，可是當今非但不禁，且准許公映，無疑的，這是時代的輪子向前的轉着，也有人認爲這是向後的轉着，因爲牠的名目便是［返回自然］，這是其他問題，這裏且放下不提。</p>
<p>未來的事難料，也許［裸體運動］眞有成功的一天也説不定，這是要看情形起了，余料雖成功亦難保久，迷失了牠的眞義，反而祇有害處罷了！因着大家全裸露［生殖器，［生殖器］也就和現在的［手］一樣的平凡了！眼裏瞧着，又便於舉事，在某種［感應性］起作用時，牠的不良的結果更容易發生呢！</p>
<p>［回到自然］的目標，當前都認牠是［健康身體］的先鋒了，牠也承就了這個名義而號召其他，可是拿現在的眼光看，簡直爲了要看［生殖器］才實行這個的來。果有此意，鄙人不妨策劃一種衣着如下，我想較裸體運動要快一步的多了　　女｜長旗袍於褲襠處剜一大圓洞，臂部則設法使之全裸，乳部亦然，或作長，方，三角形，其他精巧圖樣。</p>
<p>男｜西裝者於褲襠處開一能拖出生殖器之小洞，其他可不必漏臉。着長袍者可仿女子樣。</p>
<h3 id="c267">論讀書 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 乾序</p>
<p>讀書的目的，當然是各個不同，但大家想藉它做攫得舒服生活的工具則一。</p>
<p>古人的［十載寒窗］是想［平步青雲］今人的［出洋留學］是得［博士學位；］雖然儘有讀破萬卷書依舊一　青衿終其身的，而得到博士學位的也未必個個做大官｜｜就是説未能過到［舒服生活］，那祇是古今一例的［窮通有命，富貴在天］，一件無可奈何的事，眞眞是命也夫。</p>
<p>的古　　　　　　　　　　［書］不可不讀］，而今人也公認讀書是個人的唯一的［出路］。所以讀書的方法，烏可不論？</p>
<p>在從前，四書五經是必讀書，一切的根基，出身都在這上面。然而到現在，時代不同了，這種陳腐的東西，還有誰肯去顧問？雖然［復古］的先生們，還肯從古董裏去翻出寳藏來，可是終竟很少人注意了。然而不幸，除了從啓蒙到小學，到中學，尚有一定的軌道可循外，過此便是岐路紛陳，莫知可否；也有人以［興趣］［志向］等等去决定前途，然而總没有以能得［舒服生活］的手叚來得巧妙而高明。如果眞要以［福國利民］爲自己的責任，那便是一個頂大頂大的［傻瓜］。</p>
<p>爲了中國的［傻瓜］非常之少，於是在海外學醫學的便回來鑽進了文學的圈套，而學軍事學的也回來高高揚起了政治的旗幟。</p>
<p>讀書究意要不要指導？那指導人的當然是先知先覺者，被指導的當然是後知後覺者，或者竟是不知不覺者。這裏所説的［指導］，當然就是説先知先覺者告訴後知後覺者或不知不覺者以怎樣可以過［舒服生活］的方法，（注意：有狹義與廣義之分）也就是説怎樣讀書和讀點什麽書。林語堂是竭力不贊成讀書要指導的，同時也是一個竭力反對學校教育的一員，他所持的理由是［學問思想是慢慢胚胎滋長出來的，祗須順其自然，一些不可勉强］。而尤其不可以［我之所嗜好以强人讀］，劉知幾的能讀左傳而不能讀古文尚書便是一個例。所以他主張自己去找與自己氣質相近的先　的文章去讀。</p>
<p>其實，讀書要指導原不是一件壞的事，袛須指導得法，所謂［因勢而利導之］，　如　　幾讀古文尚　　　　打亦讀不來的時候，倘使有人指導他去讀左傳，豈不是一件很好的事？幸而他聽見他的同學讀左傳而心好之，方易成誦，假使他一生不聽見人讀左傳，豈不是把一個絶好資質浪費了。所以，尤其是徘徊歧路而尚未有鑑别力的人，極需要有相當的指導。</p>
<p>林語堂先生在申報月刋的二月號上説，讀書須有胆識，有眼光，有毅力，我以爲讀書還必須要有目標，因爲有了前者還祇有客觀的批評，而後者方有主觀的認識。</p>
<h3 id="c268">公務人員與娱樂場 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>新生活運動的曙光</p>
<p>據報載自蔣委員長發起實行新生活運動而後，南昌日來已無軍人乘人力車，茶樓，酒館，妓院，娱樂塲中，公務人員，已告絶跡，如果屬實那麽我們不能不承認是新生活運動的成效呢！</p>
<p>本來我們走到南京，閘北，尤其是内地，茶樓，酒館，妓院，娱樂塲中，那一處没有公務人員的足跡？論理，公務人員應當做市民的模範，而現在公務人員却首先去做這些墮落的勾當，那能使市民不是去倣效呢？</p>
<p>做了一個公務人員，祇要肩膀上有肩章，胸口掛了徽章，坐車子可不出錢，看戲可不出錢，吃茶，喝酒，也可不出錢，所謂强賒硬買，眞是無惡不作，無惡不爲呢！</p>
<p>在我們鄉下的娱樂塲中，一有了戲劇或電影，優越的座位，一早就給公務人員，軍人，警察，佔滿了，徽章和肩章的光芒四射，有了護身符白看戲没有人敢説話，在戲院裏，還要張牙舞爪，目中無人，時常閙事。</p>
<p>啊！公務人員應當做人們的模範，而現在　　　　　　　　　　　　　　維持地方秩序的，而現在非但秩序不維持，反而去擾亂秩序，所謂尸位素餐，爲民衆的賊人，早已有目而其覩了！</p>
<p>所以要中國的民衆的知道禮義廉恥，一改平常的墮落，頺廢的狀態，而遵守新生活的　　委實不是從公務人員；　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　認的！</p>
<p>現在，因爲蔣委員長在南昌，所以南昌先在着手整頓，結果，没有一個軍人再坐人力車，茶樓，酒館，妓院，娱樂塲中，公務人員已完全絶跡了，但除了南昌之外，各地的軍政當局，都應所　　　　　　　規的，否則單有南昌一地，又有何用呢？</p>

<p>推開了小樓的窗，微風　　的挾着　　送進來，從　　　口望出去的天空，　　的一片，　　　點點，　院子裏傳來的歌聲在靜穆的空氣中激　，人會悠悠然的直靠到寫字椅裏，抽着土耳其烟，　上眼睛，想起一切平時所永遠想不到的事事物物。</p>
<p>這是春之夜。</p>
<p>春風在Ｌadies的蓬鬆頭髮上打轉，在Ｇentlemen的紫花領帶上跳舞。遊春專車送着大批的都市男女去呼吸另一個世界的春的氣息。牠帶來了輕快活潑的情調，每個人沉醉在春的懷抱中。</p>
<p>幾個年青人在南京看了雲裳艶曲出來，幾條腿輕鬆地滑上霞飛路，踏進了俄羅斯咖啡館。大塊的牛排，剌激性的酒精，放肆地和女侍調情，悲哀掉在歡樂後面，儘量的享受這一刻值千金的春宵。</p>
<p>歪斜的跌出咖啡館，霓紅燈映着我張緋紅的臉，唱着，笑着，像水手們一樣，黃包車圍攏來喊着［立刻寫］。</p>
<p>［有花堪折直須折，莫待無花空折枝］一個異國女郎微笑的注意着我們，她不明白説話的意義和我們笑的理由。　　右手凑近唇邊送了個飛吻，她嬌嗔地一聲Ｎansehce，像音樂一樣的動人。春天，這是快樂的季候，我們祇能笑，人生爲歡幾何，莫辜負了好春光；樂罷，這春之夜。</p>
<p>幾個人打着肩頭，踏着沉重的步伐，大軍進行曲似的，直向霞飛路西行。晚上的霞飛路富於誘惑性，兩旁店舖裏幽綠的燈光照着女人的内衣，春裝的模特兒，年青人的心跳蕩着，罪惡恐怕就在這裏開始搜捕牠的俘虜。</p>
<p>行行重行行，追出了每一個行路的人，漸漸地不聞電車聲了。夜色已深，不由地返過頭來［回去罷］。窗飾内不見了女人的内衣，春裝模特兒，咖啡館中的音樂也懶洋洋的没有先前有勁，俄羅斯女人碰着我們的肩説［Ｌovemetonigbt］。</p>

<h3 id="c270">文士與官 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 嵩</p>
<p>科舉時代，政府以文取士，文人於是成爲社會上的優越階級。所謂［萬般皆下品，惟有讀書高］，便是代表一般人尊重文人的明證。文人旣受國家之特殊待遇，祇要熟讀聖人之書和學得做八股文的工夫，求官封爵，自是非屬怎樣困難的事，至少比一般庶民之流容易得多，文士們處於這種左右逢源的地位，進則爲官，退則爲雅人，爲布衣，依然不失爲一受人敬重的文士，眞所以文士可以説是人上人。而且據説文士自古多清高，厭棄世俗，無心宦途，都是留爲後人讚頌的美談。有名的陶淵明不爲五斗米折腰，寗願罷官，掛冠歸田，這無疑地是代表古之文士屬於清高也者的典型人物。</p>
<p>因其時代潮流轉移之故，所以古之文士與官實有密切之關係，祇要忠心耿耿，鞠躬盡瘁，則皇恩浩蕩，固不患無官可作。而降至今日，文士們在一般人的心眼中已失去了從前的身份，而其社會上的地位更不勝有今昔之感，况且在此物競天擇的時代裏，文士尤爲不能如前輩人之作爲游閒階級而生存。以前文士是有官不幹，現在却是求官而不可得。至於如陶淵明一類賣弄清高的人物當然絶無其人了。</p>
<p>或者谓現在雖亦有考試院之設立，甄别人材，選賢拔能，俾英雄有用武之地，不致興懷才不遇之感，此誠不能不謂爲文士進身之階。然而於千百人中，幸而能被錄用，固屬鳳毛麟角，旣應選舉，亦復少有實官，不過畀一有其名而無其實之官銜而已，空頭支票，兌現無期，而枵腹以待，絶無實惠可言，官與不官，蓋不分軒輊也。</p>
<p>文人滿腹經綸，生花筆頭，不難發而爲讜言莊論，而究其力量，不啻紙上談兵，無補實際。因爲今日是軍國民主義時代，一切摾鼻子，踱方步，斯文公卵泡，多在淘汰之列，文士們所以不能爲一官半職，非由於政府之歧視，而文士們的本身力量薄弱，固一無足取也，著述吟詠，舞弄筆墨，皆爲文士唯一本色，捨此而外，一無足長，嗚呼文人，其何以自處。</p>

<p>— 亦敏</p>
<p>祼體的女性</p>
<p>暹羅女子的裝束，是非常簡單的。在城市裏，大都是下身圍一幅花布，上身僅僅在乳部鬆鬆的裹一條三四寸闊的白紗。有的連白紗也不用，胸部完全坦露着。那些妙齡的少女，間或穿一件紗製的背心，看來倒也有别有一種風趣。至於鞋襪，她們是不需要的，就是貴族的婦女出門，也不過在跣露的脚上，套一雙皮製的拖鞋而已。可是金屬品的裝飾，她們是不可或缺的，就是一個挑着，</p>
<p>檳榔担的女販，腰間也得圍上一條金褲帶或銀褲帶，比較有幾個錢的，那末除了金腰帶外，手指上總有這麽一兩只鑽戒。講到離開城市較遠的地方，聽说她們中間的大多數，還過着完全赤裸的生活呢。</p>
<p>這裏要附帶说一説的，就是暹羅女子的勤勞。無論是種田捕魚，或者是挑葱賣菜，可以説都是女子的職務。男子反而在家裏抱孩燒飯。所以［在家從父，出嫁從夫，夫亡從子，］這一類的話，暹羅女子是不適用的。她們非特不需要依賴男子，事實上男子還依賴了她們。</p>
<p>雨季與洪水</p>
<p>暹羅的天氣，也眞奇怪。不但長年炎熱如夏，而且下雨也有定時。自九月中旬起，大概在每天中午總要下一塲大雨，約摸兩小時後，就雨過天晴了。這樣一連有一個多月，這就是所謂雨季。十一月起，就不會下雨了一直要到明年九月才能得到甘露在這無雨的時期，没有河流地方的居民，對於飲料是非常担心的。所以在雨季裏，他們把水儲在地窟裏，以備無雨時的取用。（上面講的是内地情形，在曼谷是有自來水的，居民還不會感到這種痛苦，）有時水用完了，就得用牛車到數十里外去購買，可是價錢也貴得可以，普通一火油箱的淡水，要合到中國四五角大洋之多。</p>
<p>雨季過後大約一個月，就是洪水的時期了。水來時，也是在中午，明明是一條街道，一轉眼會變成一道河流。到晚　歸來時，地上又很乾燥了。這樣，差不多要三四個星期。漲得高的時候，街上是可以行船的。所以暹人的房屋，雖然在陸地，也要像烏籠似的建在五六尺高的木椿上，就是怕洪水冲毁的緣故。不過暹羅的農業，實在得到洪水的利益不少。因爲經過了一次泛濫，必定有許多河泥魚蝦等東西留在田裏這樣，人力的灌漑固然可以免除，就是增加農民負担的肥料也可以省掉了。</p>

<p>(Beiping) This morning, after paying respects at the Japanese cemetery in Beiping, Machijiri, Military Attache to the Emperor of Japan, accompanied by Japanese military official Shibayama, Chief of Staff Kikuchi of the Tianjin Garrison Army, and Matsui, head of the Chengde Special Affairs Agency, traveled by car to Gubeikou to inspect the local Japanese troops at about 10:00 AM. They are scheduled to return to Beiping on the 7th, and will go to Tianjin on the morning of the 8th. After a brief stay, they will proceed to the Yuyu area to inspect the Japanese troops. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shibayama said that the recent arrival of Japanese troops in Malanyu is to protect the transportation of the Luan River's upstream, and the rumor that they are to protect Puyi's tomb sweeping is inaccurate. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A dispatch from Miyun states that Lieutenant Colonel Kito, commander of a Japanese cavalry platoon, led a cavalry platoon from Yuyu to Malanguan on the evening of the 3rd. Upon arriving at the pass, he convened a meeting of village chiefs from nearby villages and raised four questions, asking them to answer, including: (1) How is the discipline of the local security team? (2) Do the police at the Public Security Sub-bureau have any illegal behavior? (3) Are there any bandits in the area? (4) Does the Chinese government have the ability to protect the local people? All four items must be answered accurately and signed, and it was said that if the villagers have any difficulties, they can jointly submit a written request, and the Japanese side will take responsibility for protection. The village chiefs understood the Japanese side's seductive tactics, and answered each item as follows: (1) There are no security teams stationed here. (2) Director Shi of the local Public Security Sub-bureau treats the villagers very peacefully, and illegal behavior is impossible to mention. (3) Banditry in the area has long been suppressed, and even if there are small bandits, the local defense has the ability to clear them. (4) The government does have considerable protection capabilities for the area. After the village chiefs answered, Kito took out a handgun and ordered them to sign as proof, and took it to Gubeikou on the morning of the 4th. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the Jiyu-Miyun area, at each small pass along the Great Wall, except for Zengjialu, where there are still a few puppet police who have not withdrawn, there are no traces of Japanese and puppet troops in the other small passes. In the near future, we will send police to station there to strictly prevent the import of drugs. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shibayama is scheduled to go to Shanxi on the 8th. After finishing his tour in Taiyuan, he will go to Datong to visit the Yungang Grottoes. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the Gubeikou area, there are currently two companies of Japanese troops, five or six military police, over twenty Manchukuo police, and one customs clerk stationed. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Feng Shoushan, Commander of the Yutian Security Special Agent Team, Has Softened <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Removal of Defensive Works</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng Returns to Tongxian</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Feng Shoushan, the commander of the Yutian Security Team's Special Agent Team, planned to request an increase of several hundred men to his department. On the 4th, he guarded the city gate and piled up sandbags. The situation was serious for a time. Until noon on the 5th, Feng softened because he was aware that the provincial government had concentrated the Zunhua-Qianxi MinTuan on the Yutian border to block it. Feng Shoushan removed the defensive works on the afternoon of the 5th and listened to the authorities' downsizing. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong said that when Hu Xiewu was not dead, the Yutian Security Team had expanded to 2,300 men without permission. Now, as soon as they are downsized, 900 men will be discharged first, and the remaining 400 men will be commanded by Feng Shoushan, who will also have to be downsized in the future to completely resolve the issue without leaving any trouble behind. Even after the downsizing is completed and salaries are paid, they will be paid according to 1,000 men. Not a single additional one will be given. There is a rumor that there will be changes in the Yutian police team, but no report has been received yet, so it is probably inaccurate. When the team was organized, it borrowed five or six hundred Japanese guns. The Japanese side said they did not want them, and the provincial government did not covet this cheapness, so they returned them upon delivery. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng returned to the Tongxian Public Office this morning to handle official business. According to reports, the Yutian Security Captain Han reported to Ping that the area was peaceful. The rumor that the Yutian Security Team had redeployed is inaccurate. The increase in Japanese troops in Gubeikou was a transit, and they left after a short rest. The issue of the withdrawal of puppet police from Nantianmen and other places has been handled by Huo Shi nearby, and I have telegraphed him because Shibayama went to Gubeikou. There should be no problems in general. Negotiations on the reception of Malanyu have not yet begun. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A senior military officer said that the Yutian team police are holding onto transportation agencies, which is clearly resisting provincial orders and disobeying downsizing. In order to prevent police riots and disturbances, the Central Government has telegraphed the Ping Military Branch and Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, to take effective precautions against police riots and local ruffians in the area to avoid their collapse and harm to the people.

Secretary-General Yang and Director Cai of the Executive Office, and Chairman Xiong all went to the station to welcome him. Huang stayed at No. 3 Gongyuan and immediately met with Chiang to report on the situation in North China.

<p>Limit the Miners to Resume Work Within Three Days</p>
<p>Arrest Zhao Dazhong, the Leader of the Incident</p>
<p>Telegraph to Tao Shangming Not to Compromise with the Strikers</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This afternoon, the provincial government telegraphed Tao Shangming and Zhao Xun, instructing them not to compromise and agree to any conditions with the striking Kailuan miners. Zhao Dazhong and others, the leaders of the incident, should be arrested and sent to Tianjin for severe punishment by the provincial government. Yu Xuezhong said that last night, he instructed Zhao Xun and Zhao Lei by telephone to lead their respective departments to strictly protect the mine machinery, mine shafts, and foreign residences to prevent worker riots. On one hand, arrest Zhao Dazhong, and on the other hand, notify the workers to resume work within three days, otherwise they will be arrested. The Tangshan mine unrest is purely the work of a few troublemakers. This time, we will take a fundamental solution to avoid further labor unrest, even if there are sacrifices, we will not count it. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government received a telegram from President Wang saying that the mine unrest should be resolved quickly so as not to expand the unrest. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhao Lei, the captain of the War Zone Security Team, and Zhao Dazhong have a colleague relationship. After the provincial government's telegram arrived in Tangshan on the 6th, Zhao signaled Dazhong to escape, so Zhao Dazhong has not appeared today. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhao Dazhong lost the faith of the striking miners of Tangshan Mine. When he goes out, he is accompanied by three Japanese and Korean people and a dozen gangsters, carrying weapons for protection. Zhao once lied to the Japanese side that he could pull in 50,000 workers from Eastern Hebei to be used by a certain party. Now that this matter has not been achieved, the Japanese garrison is also dissatisfied with him. On the 5th, the Japanese army entrusted Sugimura to express to the Tangshan gentry and merchants that Zhao Dazhong's actions were his personal affairs and had nothing to do with the Japanese side, so Zhao's power is isolated. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The striking workers of the Tangshan Mine borrowed money from the contractors on the 5th to maintain their livelihoods. Each person received two yuan in wages for this month. Because the workers lack daily necessities, they are more eager to resume work, just waiting for the mine to allow a change of conditions. The Kailuan Mining Bureau has armed its trusted workers to protect the mine shafts and machinery in the factory to prevent damage from the strikers. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Belgian Consul in Tianjin visited Yu Xuezhong and said that there are more than a hundred Belgian engineers and technicians in the Tangshan Kailuan mining area, and their lives and property must be protected. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) When the British Consul in Tianjin visited Yu Xuezhong on the 5th, he expressed that no matter how the officials handle the labor unrest, the most important thing is not to allow any conditions or issue any fees, which would lead to the bad habit of workers getting something for nothing. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kailuan strikers have not received wages for a long time, and their livelihood has become alarmed. Some violent workers, instigated by Zhao Dazhong, yesterday tied up dozens of contractor heads and extorted thousands of yuan to maintain their lives. The remaining conditions are still being worked on by all parties. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday's report from Tianjin stated that "[Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin Zhai Lansi visited Yu Xuezhong at the Hebei Provincial Government for the Kailuan coal mine labor unrest]." The word "Japanese" in the report was a mistake for "British". This is hereby corrected.</p>

<p>A Large Number of Workers Were Fired</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At about 6:00 AM on the 6th, some workers at the Tianjin Huaxin Cotton Mill planned to implement a strike in accordance with the methods of the workers at the Tangshan Huaxin Cotton Mill, demanding an increase in wages. The factory notified the Public Security Bureau to send a large armed police force to surround the factory and arrest several workers who advocated the strike. The factory, fearing a worker riot, immediately announced a layoff. After the authorities and the factory negotiated in the afternoon, Wu Jingui, Chen Wenzhang, and more than forty others were fired. The workers' night shift resumed work as usual. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Men Bingyue arrived in Ping this morning to talk about the reorganization of Sun's department. The issue has been largely completed and the aftermath has also come to an end. Yu Shiming's department will be transferred to the border between Henan and Shandong. The department opened to Linhe on the 30th of last month and arrived in Linhe on the 2nd of this month. The other departments are concentrated in the Sanshenggong area. Liu Yueting and Lu Fengnian's departments have been completely received and are determined to be transferred to the Hebei Province. The Liu department suffered the most losses in this battle. Ding Yuting's department has two brigades, Yang Ganqing's brigade is still in Ningxia, and Xia Weili's brigade has opened to Linhe. Yang Hou's small department is still rioting, and is being suppressed by the Shanxi-Suiyuan army. It is reported that they have returned to Baotou.

<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek has set up several methods for abolishing the two Southwest agencies and establishing military sub-committees, and telegraphed Chen in Guangdong. The content of the methods is to set up the Liangguang Military Sub-committee in Guangzhou, abolish the group numbers of the First and Fourth Army, uniformly change the names of the existing armies and divisions to avoid conflicts with the current numbers of the central government, appoint Chen Jitang as the director of the Military Sub-committee, Li Zongren as the deputy director, and select military commanders as members. The troops commanded by the Military Sub-committee will be based on the army or independent division as a unit. It is planned not to set up numbers such as the XXX Road, and it is also planned to set up an office of the Liangguang Military Sub-committee in Nanning. It is heard that Chen in Guangdong has expressed that the first step is to assist the central government in suppressing the communist bandits, and the second step is to change the Guangdong provincial military system to be consistent with the central government. As for the issue of the survival of the two agencies, it will be subject to the central government's orders, and Lin Yizhong is planned to be recommended to Jinjing to present his intentions. However, due to the different opinions of the Southwest veterans, further deliberation is still needed. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e25">A Perspective on Japanese-Puppet Economic Control <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>According to recent reports, the Japanese and puppet authorities have agreed to establish a Japanese-puppet economic co-prosperity treaty with the same effect as a national defense agreement. Under the pretext of developing the national economy of Manchuria, they are actually attempting to intensify the establishment of Japanese control over the puppet state. A telegram from Tokyo on the 5th stated that the original draft of the Japanese Cabinet Resources Bureau on the economic control between Japan and the puppet state is to grant the South Manchuria Railway Company the power to construct the economy of Manchuria. Adopt the form of the puppet state entrusting the company to handle the construction on behalf of the puppet state, and only report to the puppet state afterward. The company's policy is to follow the instructions of the Japanese Cabinet. It can be seen that Japan's summoning of the puppet authorities to Japan this time is actually a preparation in advance. Inferring their psychology, the so-called co-prosperity treaty is nothing more than an attempt to more thoroughly carry out a forceful exploitation of our Northeast people in order to stabilize the economic crisis of Japanese imperialism. But according to our observation, in today's environment, the Japanese have no leisure to carry out economic development in the Northeast. Even the colonial interests they seek may not really be able to compensate for their domestic crisis. To infer the reason, there are several points.</p>
<p>Since Japan seized the four northeastern provinces, all measures have been taken with the establishment of a military base as the primary goal. The policies adopted in recent days are particularly credible. Even in terms of transportation, the completion of the Laha-Bin line has little economic value, and the realization of the Dunhua-Tumen railway is particularly designed to provide great advantages for military transportation. The Japanese use the South Manchuria Railway as the main base for controlling the transportation artery of the Northeast. All the undertakings they carry out are designed to suit the needs and organization of wartime. This is what we are familiar with. Furthermore, to verify it with recent facts, the Japanese have decided to extend the Jinzhou-Chengde railway to Dolon as a preparation for attacking Russia and cutting across Siberia. Their intention to use our East Mongolia as a base for operations against Russia is also obvious. This is one point.</p>
<p>Not only that, Japan's plundering of our Northeast was actually due to fear of the then Northeast authorities' attempt to engage in economic self-defense. When the situation of our side opening up transportation and encircling the South Manchuria Railway was about to be formed, the Japanese ambition was fully exposed. After the loss of the Northeast, the Japanese policy of restricting the economic lifeline of our 30 million compatriots has become more intense. For example, the mutual withdrawal of financial capital from various countries and the horizontal suppression of our country's commercial companies are all reflections of the existence of this policy. Because of this, the capital commodities in various parts of the Northeast are currently under the control of Japanese forces throughout the year. The hard work of the people in the Northeast is only to add huge profits to Japanese imperialists. This trend not only cannot make the economic power of the people in the Northeast gradually become strong, but it is enough to cause the opposition and disputes between Japan's domestic financial capital and the colonial forces in the Northeast. The form of the dispute may be a secret struggle between warlords and financial capitalists, or an open competition between the internal systems of financial capitalists. Regardless of who wins or loses, it has nothing to do with ordinary Japanese people. This is another point.</p>
<p>Therefore, judging from the current situation, Japan's attempt to reorganize its lineup of economic aggression against Manchuria and conclude the Japanese-puppet economic co-prosperity treaty can only be said to be due to its urgent military needs and is not enough to say that it will stabilize its domestic crisis. How can our 33 million compatriots in the four northeastern provinces get even the slightest benefit from it? What is most painful is that with the difficult situation of our Northeast compatriots, there is no way to fill the Japanese's infinite desires even in peacetime. Furthermore, after the implementation of the Japanese strategy of controlling the economy, they will use military requisitioning methods to extract every bit of bone marrow. Can there be any living beings left?</p>
<h3 id="e26">Main Department Meeting Approaching, Disarmament Prospects Bleak <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Henderson Busily Engaging with Various Countries</p>
<p>Davis Behind-the-Scenes Activities in England</p>
<p>France's Attitude Towards Germany Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>(London) Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson departs from London today for Geneva to attend the meeting of the Disarmament Conference's main department. Although the prospects remain bleak, Henderson remains optimistic, saying that there is a strong feeling that the Disarmament Conference will earnestly reorganize its work and support the reduction of armaments. Mr. Henderson will make a short stop in Paris to discuss with French Foreign Minister Barthou. The U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, today discussed the latest developments in the disarmament situation with British Foreign Secretary Simon. The British Lord Privy Seal, Eden, is scheduled to go to Geneva on Monday night to represent Britain at the meeting of the main department. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, the chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, met with the Italian Ambassador to the UK, Grandi, with the Director of the Disarmament Section of the League of Nations, Aghnides, present. Grandi reiterated Italy's views on disarmament, which are largely consistent with the memorandum submitted by Italy on January 31 of this year. Henderson also met with the former U.S. Disarmament Representative Davis, who is still acting in a semi-official capacity and has not been ordered to go to Geneva to attend the meeting of the Chairman's Group minority committee on April 10. The United States will be represented by the Minister to Switzerland, Wilson, at that time. Henderson then telephoned the Rapporteur-General of the Disarmament Conference, Czech Foreign Minister Benes. Whether Henderson will meet with French Foreign Minister Barthou before deciding his attitude, whether the British disarmament plan can be revised, and if it can be revised, whether it should be considered necessary to postpone the conference again according to the British side, or whether to adopt the Italian plan without this, will all be known after Henderson meets with Barthou. If he tends to adopt the Italian plan, the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference must be convened to discuss it. (Havas, 5th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The French government's oral response to the British memorandum of March 28 regarding the disarmament issue will be presented to the British government by the French Ambassador to the UK, Corbin, this afternoon. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Britain previously inquired about the kind of guarantees France desires as a condition for its accession to the Disarmament Convention. The French government has drafted a reply, which was submitted to the cabinet meeting today and has been unanimously approved. The reply states that France must first know, according to the British government's opinion, how many soldiers and armaments Germany can be allowed to have, and what kind of military strength France should have, before it can answer the question of implementing the guarantees of the convention. The reply also states that if Germany's rearmament is recognized as legal, then other former enemy countries will certainly demand equal rights. Finally, it states that Britain's expression of greater attention to France's demand for guarantees is gratifying. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<p>Army Minister Hayashi Visits Saionji</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Before today's regular cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Saito met with Finance Minister Takahashi and Navy Minister Yamamoto, saying that since he has already reported his determination to maintain the political situation to Prince Saionji, he should abandon the past position of a cabinet between political parties and recognize the current cabinet's independent position. He must also establish an independent policy and urged the two elders to consider it. He also reported at the cabinet meeting that since he has decided to maintain the situation, there is no need to rush to supplement the Minister of Education. The most important thing is to establish policies that are closely related to the determination to maintain the situation. Therefore, Army Minister Hayashi's visit to Prince Saionji was also to express opinions on domestic and national policies. Later, he obtained the understanding of the cabinet members. Now, after Army Minister Hayashi returns to Tokyo, the fundamental national policies will be discussed at the next cabinet meeting with all members present. After the decision, Prime Minister Saito will explain it at the local governors' conference. (Dentsu, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the observation of the Prime Minister's aides, as a result of the Prime Minister's visit to Prince Saionji, he has decided to bear the burden of the current situation, and in the future, he must actively seek ways to improve it. Therefore, it is not impossible that he will request the inclusion of the presidents of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties in the cabinet in order to achieve a national unity cabinet. Moreover, Justice Minister Oyama also visited the Prime Minister on the 4th and expressed his intention to resign due to the failure to establish the Public Security Preservation Law. If this is realized, the cabinet will be short of two members. A simple supplementary project alone cannot be expected to continue the cabinet permanently. Therefore, there is an opportunity to decisively reform the cabinet at this time. The Prime Minister's intention can be summarized in the following three points: (1) In order to overcome the crisis of 1935 and 1936, national opinion should be unified and the reality of national unity should be realized. (2) Therefore, it is necessary to seek to control the cabinet and consider the inclusion of people trusted by the people. (3) Therefore, the supplementary work of the cabinet is not limited to supplementing the Minister of Education, but there is a need for a more decisive and active reform to renew its content. Today was the first regular cabinet meeting after the Prime Minister's visit to Prince Saionji. Last night, the Chief Secretary visited the Prime Minister to discuss everything. As a result, the Prime Minister only reported on the course of his visit to Prince Saionji at today's cabinet meeting, and revealed his determination to continue to bear the current situation, encouraged the cabinet members, and asked them to cooperate and strive. He also said that Army Minister Hayashi was unable to attend due to his visit to Prince Saionji, and the replacement of the Minister of Education will also be decided within days. In the future, the government will implement an outline of important national policies, which will be discussed again at a later date. Because the fundamental national policies that the government should adopt in the future must be decided after the cabinet is reorganized. (Dentsu, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi and Navy Minister Yamamoto met with Prime Minister Saito this morning to discuss the selection of a candidate for Minister of Education. After the two ministers left, the Prime Minister summoned Commerce and Industry Minister Matsumoto to have a cordial conversation regarding the issue of assuming the post of Minister of Education.

<p>Hsi-hsia Selling Out the Country in Japan</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota believes that the foundation of peace in East Asia lies in the close alliance between Japan and Manchuria and the establishment of friendly relations between Japan and China and Russia. He is now working towards this goal. In order to carry out the first step of his work, Hirota has decided to visit Manchuria in the summer of this year to meet with Puyi and meet with important Manchurian figures to exchange views on Japanese-Manchurian issues. (Domei, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Hsi-hsia, the Minister of Finance of Manchuria, has decided to stay in Tokyo to carry out the second phase of work on Japanese-Manchurian economic issues. He has now decided on the schedule for meetings with key Japanese figures as follows: 9:00 a.m. on the 6th to meet with Prime Minister Saito, 1:00 p.m. on the 6th to meet with the Vice Minister of the Army, 6:00 p.m. on the 6th to attend Finance Minister Takahashi's banquet, 9:00 a.m. on the 7th to meet with Army Minister Hayashi, 10:00 a.m. on the 7th to meet with Finance Minister Takahashi, 11:00 a.m. on the 7th to meet with Foreign Minister Hirota, 6:00 p.m. on the 7th to attend the Bank of Japan Governor's banquet.

<p>Cheng Hsi and his party, who left Tokyo yesterday morning, were welcomed by Commander Nagano of Yokosuka Garrison, Commander Kamimura of Tokyo Bay Fortress, Mayor Mikami of Yokosuka, and many other officials and civilians. At 10:30, they arrived at Yokosuka Station and immediately went to the Oppama Naval Air Group for a tour. Thirty naval aircraft expressed their welcome to Cheng and others from the air. At noon, the group went to the harbor to attend Commander Nagano's welcoming luncheon on the warship Ise, and then toured the ship. Next, they went to Mikasa for a tour. At 4:00 p.m., they departed from Yokosuka, with Cheng going to Atami and Hsi going to Tokyo. (Domei, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the resignation of Army Minister Araki, the zaibatsu's pursuit of the military has become more urgent. Not only did they regain the supervisory rights of the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) in the Diet and smash the Mantetsu reorganization plan of the Kwantung Army's special affairs department, but now they have gone a step further, forcing the military to reform the organization of the Kwantung Army and reduce the Kwantung Army's special affairs department, giving it a final blow. It is reported that Army Minister Hayashi has also agreed and will implement the reform plan during the regular transfer period in mid-July this summer. It is said that the internal details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The zaibatsu advocated abolishing the special affairs department, but the internal situation of the military is very complicated. If it is abolished, it will be attacked by the Araki faction, and it will be very difficult to control the military. Therefore, a compromise is taken, only reducing its organization and preventing military personnel from participating in various industrial organizations.</p>
<p>(2) The special affairs department currently has five departments: finance and finance department, transportation department, agriculture and forestry department, industry and mining department, and legal department. Over the past two years, it has decided on concrete plans for construction in Manchuria and its survey materials. Although it has not been able to complete its thorough investigation, there is little left. Therefore, the five departments still exist, but the departments and personnel will be reduced by half, so that the department is sufficient to complete its residual tasks but not enough to control the various industries.</p>
<p>(3) The head of the special affairs department is currently the chief of staff of the Kwantung Army. The zaibatsu had advocated that it be selected by civilian officials, but its organization has been reduced and its duties have been changed to passive. Even if military officers hold this position concurrently, no problems will arise. The zaibatsu will no longer fight on this point and will let the military decide on its own.</p>
<p>(4) Strictly prevent special affairs department members who are registered as military personnel from participating in various industrial organizations.</p>
<p>(5) This reform will be implemented from July 1.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned outline of the reform plan is currently being drafted by the General Staff Headquarters and the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry. If the Araki faction does not obstruct it, it can be implemented. (China United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>China United Press Tokyo Dispatch, March 30. The Japanese cabinet held a cabinet meeting to review its policy towards Manchuria. This case has caused problems in the Diet and will also be discussed with the puppet Cheng and Hsi about the basic plan for specific measures, so it has attracted attention from all parties. Because its content is easy to cause international discrimination, the Japanese government strictly maintains secrecy. According to the content reported by the Eastern News, it is briefly described as follows: 1. The economic and industrial policy towards Manchuria should be based on Mantetsu and implement the Japanese policy. Therefore, it is necessary to first determine the fundamental national policy for economic and industrial construction, and then decide how to reorganize the Mantetsu company.</p>
<p>2. Resolve the customs issue between Japan and Manchuria and implement economic control between Japan and Manchuria.</p>
<p>3. Expand the organization of Mantetsu and improve its content so that Mantetsu has the strength to control the entire economy of Manchuria.</p>
<p>4. The puppet state railways that Mantetsu is entrusted to operate must be expanded internally and reformed its operating methods as soon as possible from the perspective of national defense, transportation, and industrial needs.</p>
<p>5. The businesses of Mantetsu company other than railways must be separated from Mantetsu company and independently, inducing domestic capitalists to invest freely.</p>
<p>6. The administrative rights of Mantetsu's affiliated land will be transferred from Mantetsu to the Kwantung Office to govern.</p>
<p>7. The Kwantung Office will newly establish a Mantetsu supervisor to supervise all the facilities of Mantetsu, but this facility must be approved by the Privy Council.</p>
<p>8. Even the basic industries belonging to national defense and transportation are not subject to the direct control of the Kwantung Army and are generally under the jurisdiction and management of the Mantetsu company.</p>
<p>This case is the outline of the new policy towards Manchuria drafted by the Cabinet Resources Bureau based on the opinions of the Kwantung Army and Mantetsu, standing in the position of the zaibatsu. The military is very dissatisfied with this case and expressed its opinions after the cabinet meeting as follows:</p>
<p>1. The policy towards Manchuria should recognize Manchuria as an independent country and stand on an equal footing with Japan, and adopt a principle of equal distribution of benefits.</p>
<p>2. The Resources Bureau's plan wants to make Mantetsu's affiliated companies independent to facilitate capital investment and provide necessary subsidies from the Japanese government. This shows that Japan wants to compete with Manchuria for benefits and absorb all the benefits from Manchuria. As a result, it will inevitably stimulate the emerging forces in Manchuria and create an opposing consciousness towards Japan.</p>
<p>3. Russia believes that Japan's policy towards Manchuria wants to monopolize Manchuria politically and economically, and uses this to propagate to the people of Manchuria. As a result, Japan itself proves that its propaganda is true, which is unfavorable to Japan.</p>
<p>4. The Resources Bureau's case is not based on this kind of unthorough foundation and does not seek the common prosperity of the two countries. Therefore, to seek the coexistence and common prosperity of the two countries, a merger principle should be adopted, a trust organization should be adopted, and surgery should be performed on the Mantetsu company, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve the permanent economic control of the two countries.</p>
<p>The military's opinions are like this and they are very dissatisfied with this case. After Army Minister Hayashi visits the elder, he may have expressed it earnestly, but the military is no longer willing to take domestic reform measures, and the leadership has gradually returned to the zaibatsu, and the case will not undergo major changes.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese Greatly Affected</p>
<p>China United Press Siam Correspondence. The headquarters received a letter yesterday from an important overseas Chinese merchant in Bangkok, saying that Siam is the birthplace of overseas Chinese, so the overseas Chinese who engage in commerce, industry, and various other industries in Siam are also more numerous than in other places overseas. Moreover, in terms of the friendship between the two countries, it has always been harmonious. In terms of interests, the economies and politics of China and Siam have a relationship of mutual dependence. However, in recent years, Siam's political unrest has occurred from time to time, and the economy has also been in distress, which has involved many overseas Chinese. For example, the promulgation of import regulations and education regulations has in fact been unfavorable to overseas Chinese in many ways, and the impact on the relations between the two countries is also very great. In addition, the Japanese are eager to plot against Siam, especially regarding the overseas Chinese as a thorn in their side, and thus fueling the flames. Therefore, the position of overseas Chinese in Siam is indeed in danger. In February, the Siamese government held a cremation ceremony for the fallen soldiers who suppressed the rebellion in the Royal Field. A Japanese warship happened to arrive in Siam on the 16th and participated in the ceremony. On the 18th, it hosted a banquet for the Siamese military and political authorities, and then invited people from all walks of life in Siam to visit, nominally to strengthen friendly relations, but in fact to exaggerate the matter to boast about the power of the Japanese navy, which is nothing less than a demonstration. Afterwards, the personnel of the Japanese embassy had many secret talks with the Siamese authorities. It is heard that as a result, Japan will manufacture four cruisers for Siam, each priced at 200,000 Japanese yen. As for why the pricing is so low, it is actually because there is another secret agreement between the two parties. It was also rumored that Japan had obtained a promise from the Siamese government to build a canal at the border between Siam and England, running through the Malay Peninsula, as a new base for Japan's military and commercial activities in the South Seas, and to confront Singapore. This is not without reason. Recently, Japanese small merchants have penetrated deep into the interior of Siam, especially those scattered throughout the areas bordering England and Siam. Along the coast, there are Japanese fishing boats coming and going like shuttles. In normal times, this commercial network can be used to promote the sale of Japanese goods. Once an incident occurs, it will have other uses. Moreover, the political unrest that Siam has accumulated is still deeply latent. If it breaks out again, it will inevitably give the Japanese an opportunity to exploit it. When the world crisis of 1936 breaks out, the Siamese issue may be the fuse for an armed conflict between England and Japan. In addition, the Japanese have widely spread slogans of Japanese-Siamese friendship among the Siamese people. Previously, they published advertisements in the Siamese newspapers, attracting Siamese people to visit Japan. The cost is particularly low. The Japanese side will cover all the costs of ship fares, train fares, food, and accommodation for each person. The sightseeing period is about two months, but the cost is only about 300 baht, in order to arouse the goodwill of the Siamese. This is the same as the so-called "Japan-Manchuria friendship" and "Japan-China friendship". As for the commercial development of the Japanese in Siam, it is giving overseas Chinese a great blow, and since there is no formal commercial treaty between our country and Siam, it is even easier to be squeezed out by the Japanese. In short, the position of overseas Chinese in Siam is quite dangerous at present. If we do not take urgent rescue measures, the future is very worrying.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Arms Embargo Export Case <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Roosevelt's Attitude Unfathomable</p>
<p>Treating Both Belligerents Equally</p>
<p>Tendency to Accept Senate Amendment</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. President Roosevelt hoped that Congress would grant him the privilege of prohibiting the export of armaments a year ago. Now, the opinions of the House and Senate on the issue of prohibiting the export of armaments are very different. Therefore, the President's hope for this matter is largely unfathomable. When President Roosevelt took office, the situation in the Far East and South America was tense. Therefore, the President's request for this privilege was nothing more than for the sake of world peace. If the President once had the power to prohibit the export of armaments, then the President's position would be sufficient to allow the United States to collude with the powers to stop the export of armaments that endanger world peace from any country. The President's advisors declared before the Congressional Committee that all governments have the power to embargo the export of armaments. The U.S. government, in order to take consistent action with various countries to seek world peace, also asks Congress to grant it the same power. The House and Senate have already passed the "Bill to Grant the President the Privilege of Prohibiting the Export of Armaments", and the President also firmly believes that Congress will grant him broad powers on this matter. However, in the eyes of the President's advisors, only one of the bills passed by the two houses is barely satisfactory. According to the bill passed by the House, the President has the power to cooperate with other countries to prohibit the transportation of armaments to belligerent countries. However, the Senate added an amendment to the House's bill, which stated that when exercising the power to prohibit the export of armaments, all belligerent countries should be treated equally, without any favoritism. According to this amendment, even if the United States alone or in cooperation with other countries is willing to declare a prohibition on the export of armaments to belligerent countries, it will not be able to do so. It is said that the President has two steps to take on this case. One is to accept the Senate's amendment, and the other is to strive for the Senate to independently pass the House's bill. If the President takes the latter, he will encounter more difficulties, because the minority senators who oppose the case have a way to temporarily shelve the case, and the Congressional agenda is very tight, and the case may even be permanently delayed by the Senate. If the President takes the former, it will inevitably show the government's surrender, but the President and his advisors may think that the sacrifice of fighting for this power is not worth the loss, and decide to accept the Senate's amendment to console themselves.

<p>Congress Passes Important Bill</p>
<p>Britain Expresses Dissatisfaction at Receiving the Same Treatment</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Johnson's bill to impose financial blockade on countries that have not paid their war debts was passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives on January 10th and April 4th respectively. This law stipulates that countries indebted to the US, whether they are in complete arrears or only partially in arrears, will no longer be allowed to issue national bonds in the US market. After the passage of this bill, there has been much debate in political circles here about its scope of application. For example, some countries, including Britain, have repaid part of their war debts that have come due in the past to show that they are not repudiating the debt. It is questionable whether the Johnson law applies to these countries. Some say that when Britain and some other countries repaid part of their war debts on June 15, 1933, and December 15, Roosevelt wrote back to the governments of those countries, saying that the US government did not regard the partial repayment of war debts by those countries as a breach of contract. However, Senator Johnson, the drafter of the new law, said, "The financial blockade applies to countries that are partially in arrears as well as countries that are completely in arrears. The wording is very clear, and Britain is included." The State Department was unable to provide an accurate interpretation of the new law today. As for the British Embassy, it said that Britain had repaid part of the debt to show that Britain had the sincerity to acknowledge the debt, and the US had repeatedly acknowledged this in official documents to the British government, so the Johnson law should not apply to Britain. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) The bill proposed by US Senator Johnson to stop financial assistance to foreign governments that have not paid their overdue war debts has been passed by both houses of Congress and is only awaiting Roosevelt's promulgation to take effect. The fact that this bill treats Britain the same as other countries that have not repaid their debts is extremely displeasing to all sectors of British society. Official circles are waiting for the law to be implemented before deciding on a course of action. British public opinion believes that the reason why the US Congress is so strict with Britain is because Britain's budget surplus for the previous year was more than 31 million pounds. Americans psychologically believe that since the British treasury is rich, why not repay the US debt? They do not know that the reason why the British Treasury has not fully repaid the war debts that have come due is not due to a lack of funds, but for another reason. On the one hand, the US demands that all countries repay their war debts, and on the other hand, it strictly closes the US market, preventing foreign goods from entering. How can such a method allow international trade to flow freely? This is the reason why Britain is unwilling to fully repay its war debts. As for prohibiting European countries from borrowing money from the US again, this is not taken seriously here, because the London market is full of capital and is worried about not being able to lend it out.

According to a statement from the State Department, US Ambassador Bullitt is in Moscow discussing with the Soviet authorities the issue of old Russian debts to the US. The suspension of the Export-Import Bank is intended to facilitate the early success of these negotiations. US Ambassador to Russia Bullitt has submitted several plans for resolving the debt issue to Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov. Bullitt recently reported to the State Department that the debt issue has been submitted to Stalin for review. The main difficulty in resolving the US-Russia debt issue is that the US demands that the Soviet Union pay a total sum, and then the US government will distribute it to the American people who hold bonds from the Tsarist era and the Kerensky era after the revolution. As for the Soviet Union, it is extremely cautious and wants to avoid any action that could be interpreted as directly or indirectly acknowledging the Tsarist debts. However, the board of directors of the US Export-Import Bank has passed a resolution stating that "the board believes that if the Soviet government does not propose an acceptable solution to the debt owed to the US, the US will not be able to lend money to the Soviet Union."</p>

There are also people in Cuba who oppose this approach, fearing that this large amount of new currency will affect the value of the Cuban currency after it enters Cuba. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e49">Verdict in the Assassination of Romanian Premier Duca Finalized <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Three Principal Offenders Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, the Rest Released</p>
<p>Greatly Exceeding the Government's Expectations</p>
<p>The Determination to Eliminate the Iron Guard Suffers a Blow</p>
<p>Seventy-three members of the Iron Guard, who were arrested in Bucharest for the assassination of Romanian Prime Minister Duca, were sentenced today by the military court of the Second Army Corps. Among them, three were sentenced to life imprisonment. The other two are also students, named Bellesmes and Calinica, all of whom were involved in the conspiracy. This verdict is far from what was expected in Romanian political circles beforehand, because officials all believed that the main offenders could not escape the death penalty, and the accomplices would certainly not be spared. Now, the three main offenders have only been sentenced to life imprisonment, and the accomplices have been acquitted, which is really beyond the expectations of the government authorities, and the government's determination to eliminate the Iron Guard has also suffered a blow. Therefore, such a huge assassination case has ended up with such a result, and it must be said that it is a great failure of the current government. Furthermore, since the verdict was announced, Prime Minister Tartarescu immediately entered the palace to meet with King Carol, so there are rumors outside that the current government has already resigned en masse. However, the Prime Minister later met with reporters to deny this, saying that the current situation is too serious and the current cabinet cannot shirk its responsibilities. Then, its fate will probably be extended to the time when Congress convenes on Friday. It is also reported that the Prime Minister has requested King Carol to implement the "National Security Decree" to crack down on all treasonous acts with severe measures, but whether King Carol will grant his request is still uncertain.

<p>Diver Drunk as a Skunk</p>
<p>(London) A bizarre news story about a diver occurred here a few days ago, causing everyone who heard it to burst into laughter. A diver (commonly known as a water ghost) was hired to search for sunken cargo in the deep sea. A water boat went to the surface of the sea with him. The diver went down into the water along the sea ladder, and after several hours, there was still no movement, and no goods were raised. Everyone on the boat was extremely anxious. Later, there was a strange movement on the surface of the sea. The people on the boat pulled the sea ladder up and saw that the diver's hands were tightly holding the ladder, and he was extremely drunk. It turned out that he had been drinking whisky in the water 60 feet deep from the surface of the sea, which had caused him to become drunk. When he found a wooden box in the sea, he unexpectedly opened the whisky in the box, causing a large amount of alcohol to flow out. He then drank heavily, resulting in a drunken stupor.

<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has issued a handwritten order to all civil and military organizations stating that those who have not learned military etiquette are not allowed to wear military uniforms or military hats. It is said that this order was issued because Chiang recently encountered a military officer near his private residence who did not know how to salute. Chiang personally provided guidance and admonishment. The officer was extremely frightened and even knelt down. Chiang became even more angry and said, "You are a dignified active-duty soldier of the nation, with the party emblem on your hat and the military symbol on your body. How can you be so frightened and disoriented? You truly lack a sense of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor." The officer has been ordered to be handed over to the military law department for punishment. (6th Dispatch, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e67">Salt Affairs Conference Concludes <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Cancellation of Salt Certificates</p>
<p>Planning for Loans for Lianghuai</p>
<p>Implementation of the New Salt Law</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Salt Affairs Conference convened by the Salt Affairs Administration continued its meeting on the morning of the 6th, chaired by Zhu Tingqi. It was adjourned at 4:00 PM, and Zhu will hold individual discussions with local directors on the 7th. It is reported that the resolutions of the conference were: (1) The abolition of salt certificates. After discussion, detailed measures have been agreed upon and will be implemented in stages. (2) A decision was made to raise a loan of 8 million yuan for Lianghuai, and the repayment method and phased plan have also been largely drafted. (3) Implementation of the New Salt Law. It was decided to centralize the production area, unify transportation and sales, and abolish anti-smuggling measures, to be implemented after achieving unified control. The New Salt Law was drafted in 1930 by Finance Minister Song Ziwen, with the principle of abolishing the salt merchant system and unified sales throughout the country at one time. At that time, salt merchants strongly opposed it, and the Ministry of Finance also had loan relationships with banks, where salt certificates were used as collateral. Once canceled, the salt certificates would be worthless. Therefore, in order to maintain credit, it could not be implemented. It is reported that this time, the Ministry of Finance plans to first repay the loans of Lianghuai and is determined to implement the reform. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has decided to adopt a rotating transportation system for the production and sales of salt in Lianghuai, gradually implementing it with the aim of improving salt transportation, striving for convenience, and reducing private corruption. To address the livelihoods of more than 200,000 sail-transporting boatmen, new salt areas will be opened up in Lianghuai to accommodate some of them, and land will be surveyed in Lianghuai to establish improved local cloth and other factories, so that the boatmen can work in the factories to secure their livelihoods. However, it is stipulated that this will be maintained until the salt workers' children can support themselves. Factory expenses will be covered by part of the revenue from the conversion of salt weight. This will stabilize the livelihoods of the boatmen and also promote the development of industry. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance is determined to implement the new converted tax rate after the weight conversion of salt. It has instructed Salt Commissioner Zhu Tingqi to participate in the drafting of a response to the two inquiries from the Supervisory Committee member Luo Jiefu, etc. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Recovers Bandit Area of Ling</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Since the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army mobilized and pressed into the bandit area, it has been advancing from Chengjiang towards Junmen, having already advanced more than ten miles. The vanguard had a brief encounter with the bandits guarding Junmen. The bandits entrenched in Junmen, led by Ye Jianying, relied on the dangerous terrain and fortifications for cover and were still holding out. The National Army, considering the perilous terrain of Junmen, believed that it would not be easy to destroy the bandit fortifications without the help of the air force. On the 27th of last month, it ordered the air force squadron to carry heavy bombs to bomb the area. After receiving the order, the squadron dispatched planes from Meixian to Junmenling Yuxu to drop bombs, immediately destroying three bandit fortifications. On the 28th, the air force squadron telegraphed, reporting that according to intelligence, the bandit leader Ye Jianying led several thousand remnants to build fortifications at Junmenling, and at 4:00 AM on the 28th, they sent planes to Junmenling Yuxu, dropping two 100-pound bombs and destroying three bandit fortifications, circling the mountain range for an hour before flying back to Meixian.</p>
<p>On the Jiangnan front, since the main force of the First Army advanced towards Anyuan, new defense arrangements have been made. Communist bandits occasionally appeared near Tianxinwei. At the end of last month, more than 1,000 bandits from the pseudo-22nd Division attacked the local anti-communist groups, but they were dispersed. At the same time, Wang Zanbin's troops also discovered more than 100 Red bandits in Qingfeng Mountain and sent Long Zhenyi's regiment to suppress them. They engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits in civilian clothes for two hours, killing more than 40 people and capturing two female bandits. Commander-in-Chief Yu Hanmou, in order to inspect the bandit situation on the front lines, took a plane from the headquarters on the 30th and inspected various bandit areas for a week before returning. He has ordered all frontline units to strictly implement measures to blockade the bandit areas and cut off the bandit areas' food supply. The bandit areas have been facing difficulties in food supply for days.</p>
<p>The bandit area of Ling near Ganzhou is about 80 li from the county seat of Lingdu. Recently, the Communist bandits in the area forced able-bodied men to enlist and forcibly confiscated food, causing resentment among the people. On the 29th of last month, the local people spontaneously revolted, killing several Communist bandit leaders, destroying three pseudo-township governments, and publicly elected popular leaders to request that the Division of the Bull Ridge Defense Army send troops to Ling to garrison. As a result, the officers and soldiers of the Division recovered the bandit area of Ling without firing a single shot. (3rd)</p>

<p>Military Food to Be Supplied by the Rear</p>
<p>Chongqing dispatch: Since Liu Xiang was ordered to supervise the suppression of Sichuan bandits, he has recovered most of the bandit areas. Liu received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek yesterday, ordering the troops in Sichuan to reduce and exempt grain taxes and miscellaneous levies to alleviate the suffering of the people. After receiving the telegram, Liu immediately forwarded it to the troops, ordering them to comply and not to impose local levies or grain taxes. Liu also telegraphed a reply to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, stating in the original telegram: "Having read your secret telegram from Jiangxi, I am informed that refugees and gentry in northern Sichuan have repeatedly telegraphed complaints about the stationed troops in the disaster area imposing levies and demanding grain. I have ordered all units to strictly warn them not to force levies and to reduce and exempt grain taxes to alleviate the suffering of the people. Your Excellency's compassion for the remaining people and clear statement of military discipline are deeply admired. Since I was ordered to lead the troops this time, I have followed the principle of 30% military and 70% political affairs, as instructed by Your Excellency. I have repeatedly issued strict warnings to the frontline troops to reassure the masses and achieve cooperation between the military and the people. Subsequently, reports from various parties indicate that troops in various places are still imposing levies and demanding grain. After detailed investigation, I found that the reason is that the food in the bandit areas was mostly concentrated and transported away by the Red bandits. After the recovery, the military food was greatly depleted, and sometimes the transportation was not timely, resulting in the aforementioned incidents. I immediately ordered all units not to rely on local supplies for grain and to have all grain and rations supplied by the rear. At the same time, I telegraphed the governments of Hunan and Hubei provinces, requesting them to protect rice merchants, allow them to trade freely, and exempt them from taxes. I also ordered the commanders of various routes to investigate the severity of the disaster in the recovered areas and reduce or exempt grain taxes and miscellaneous levies accordingly for several years, reporting them at any time for verification. I have already exempted Tongnan, Bayi, Dazhao, and Guangxi counties from taxes, aiming to balance the needs of the people and the military. Now that I have received the above instructions, in addition to reiterating the orders to all troops to rest and recuperate the people in accordance with Your Excellency's wishes and not to impose levies again, I respectfully submit this telegram for your consideration.

<h3 id="e94">Activities of the French in Yunnan Province <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>｜Impressions of a U.S. Reporter's Visit to Yunnan｜</p>
<p>Mr. Burden, a correspondent for the *New York Sun* in China, recently traveled to Yunnan to investigate the activities of the French in the province. He wrote an article about his observations, which was published in the *New York Current Affairs Monthly*. We are translating it below for reference:</p>
<p>Regarding the Chinese side, there is an understanding regarding the spheres of influence of France and Japan in their activities in China. This idea has drawn attention to France's Far Eastern empire. France's power in the Far East, apart from the Guangzhou Bay leased territory and small concessions in Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hankou, is concentrated in Indochina. It holds special interests in Yunnan Province in southwest China, a place rarely visited by foreigners. The French do not deny this. In recent months, Chinese critics have felt that Japan's actions in Manchuria have upset the balance of power among the powers in China, which is bound to provoke reactions from other parties. Therefore, there is talk of France occupying Yunnan. This claim is based not only on the belief that there is an understanding between France and Japan regarding the partition of China but also on the fact that France's activities in Yunnan have clearly increased.</p>
<p>The correspondent (as the author calls himself), in view of the widespread nature of these rumors, traveled to Yunnan to conduct an on-site investigation of the situation of French activities. After the investigation, he felt that there were no signs that France was planning to drastically change its current policy. However, he did find that its monopolistic control in Yunnan Province had clearly increased.</p>
<p>The most convenient external transportation route for Yunnan Province is a single railway line, which passes through Indochina and is owned and managed by the French. The railway runs from Haiphong on the Gulf of Tonkin, through Hanoi, the capital of Indochina, to the provincial capital of Yunnan. Although the entire line is only a little over 530 miles long, the 288-mile section through Yunnan is mountainous, rugged, and steep. It is about 250 feet above sea level at the Yunnan-Vietnam border and rises to 6,400 feet in Yunnanfu (Kunming). There are no particularly fast trains on this line, and because there are many bandits in the mountains, it is closed at night. It takes three days to travel from Hanoi to Yunnanfu.</p>
<p>Except for a few areas, the entire province of Yunnan is mountainous. Most of the province is located on the Himalayan plateau, which includes Tibet and most of Sichuan Province. Some of its peaks rise to 22,000 feet above sea level. For this reason, it rarely interacts with other parts of China.</p>
<p>Only small boats can navigate the Yangtze River on the northern border of Yunnan Province. It takes 23 days to travel by camel from Yunnanfu to Xufu, and then at least six weeks to reach Shanghai by water, with many stops along the way.</p>
<p>There is another route, which involves traveling by camel from the provincial capital to Mengzi, then taking a train to Nanning in Guangxi Province, and then traveling by water along the West River to Guangzhou, which takes about a month. Conversely, it takes less than a week to travel from Guangzhou to Yunnanfu via Haiphong, and only ten days from Shanghai to Yunnanfu via Haiphong. Furthermore, traveling by camel caravan is quite expensive and is only suitable for transporting opium.</p>
<p>Years ago, there was talk of building a Yunnan-Burma railway, but the British side has not yet challenged French power by implementing this plan. There have been no recent proposals, so France's control of the gateway to Yunnan is unchallenged. Goods sealed in Indochina are not allowed by the French. Therefore, all goods shipped to Yunnan must be inspected by French customs in Haiphong. All travelers entering and leaving Yunnan Province must, of course, obtain French passports. Although, to my knowledge, such passports have never been refused to Europeans or Orientals, travelers are subject to close surveillance.</p>
<p>The transportation of goods is often prohibited. Any weapons or ammunition from non-French sources cannot enter Yunnan Province via Tonkin. Even military supplies from French sources cannot be shipped without special permission from the French authorities. However, it goes without saying that a government friendly to France can easily obtain the military supplies it needs. When I was in Yunnanfu, a shipment of munitions worth US$1.45 million arrived, which is about 60% of the province's budgeted revenue. It may also be noted that the French classify radio receivers and transmitters as military supplies and prohibit them from being shipped into Yunnan Province via Indochina, even if they come from French sources. When I was in Yunnanfu, I saw a set of equipment that a Chinese person had brought in from Shanghai via Xufu. The transportation cost was exactly equal to the selling price of the equipment in Shanghai. Any item used to manufacture munitions must be specially licensed to be shipped from Tonkin. For example, the British hospital in Yunnanfu must obtain permission from the French consul stationed there before it can import various necessary acids.</p>
<p>Airplanes are also classified as military supplies. In 1932, six American aircraft purchased by the Yunnan government were refused shipment. After protests from the U.S. State Department in Washington, they were allowed to pass. Later, the Yunnan government purchased four more aircraft, which were obtained from a French trading house.</p>
<p>All goods passing through Indochina are subject to various taxes, with the exception of tin exports, which are exempt under treaty. The amount of each tax is proportional to the tax on goods consumed within Indochina. French goods imported into Indochina, of course, have lower tariff rates than foreign goods, and the same is true of transit taxes. Therefore, French goods have an advantage over non-French goods imported into Yunnan, and Chinese goods are similarly discriminated against. At present, the Yunnan government is negotiating with the French to give Chinese goods a slight advantage over non-French foreign goods, but when the reporter drafted this article, France had not yet approved the agreement. At present, the total amount of various transit taxes is at least 5% of the value of French goods and up to 15% of the value of non-French goods.</p>
<p>Various transit taxes and freight rates are frequently changed drastically without prior notice to foreign merchants. The purpose is to favor French merchants. For example, several years ago, an American merchant competed with French and British merchants to supply the Yunnan government with water pipes. The American merchant's bid was very low, and he was confident that he would not be defeated by the French merchant. However, the contract was eventually won by the French merchant. It was later learned that when the French water pipes arrived in Haiphong, Hanoi station posted a notice stating that the transit tax on water pipes had been temporarily reduced, and the railway freight rate had also been temporarily reduced by the railway bureau.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned monopolistic methods, there are frequent complaints about delays and damage in the transportation of non-French goods. It is said that French goods are transported from Haiphong to Yunnan very quickly, while non-French goods often take two to six months to arrive. As such, although French trade in other parts of China is far less than that of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, it is not surprising that it accounts for more than 60% of Yunnan's foreign trade.</p>
<p>Among foreign trade in Yunnan, the U.S. accounts for 20%, the U.K. accounts for 15%, and other non-French countries (mainly Germany and Japan) account for only 5%. As for foreign merchants, there is only one German, who is employed by a small Chinese hydroelectric company. There are no non-French foreign merchants in Yunnan Province. Besides French commerce, all the small amount of foreign commerce, such as the Standard Oil Company, etc., is operated by Chinese.</p>
<p>Although Yunnan is China's second-largest province, with an area of 146,714 square miles, it is not an important commercial area. It has a population of only 11 million, two-thirds of whom are Han Chinese and one-third of whom are Miao. The Miao people are mostly very poor. Foreign trade, excluding munitions, which are not included in customs reports, totaled US$20,556,194 in 1930 and fell to US$4,582,921 in 1932.</p>
<p>Tin and opium are Yunnan's two major exports. The former is mostly sold to the United States, and the latter is sold entirely within the country. The total value of tin production is about US$3.6 million per year, and opium is worth three times as much as tin.</p>
<p>About 2% of the province's arable land is dedicated to growing opium. Rice must be imported from outside. Agricultural land accounts for only a small portion of the province's area, so the people in some areas often suffer from famine. Opium is the main source of private profit for the military. Its taxes account for 20% of the province's public revenue. Opium smokers are prevalent throughout the province, more so than in any other province of China that I have visited.</p>
<p>In addition to tin, Yunnan also produces many other minerals, such as coal, lead, zinc, copper, antimony, silver, and large quantities of low-quality iron. Only tin mines are widely mined. The French have never demanded the development of various mines, at least for the time being, they are content with exclusively controlling railway transportation.</p>
<p>The main component of the Yunnan government is the military oligarchy, led by General Long Yun. It nominally obeys Nanjing, but in reality, it is completely independent. Long does not seem to be overly friendly with the French, but he has to associate with them in order to obtain military supplies. According to the Chinese side, the French maintain a firm control over Yunnan's finances. This statement is largely supported by authoritative neutral parties, as the price of silver dollars in Yunnan fluctuates from time to time due to the unstable financial situation of the province. When the government obtains loans in Shanghai or Hong Kong through the sale of tin or opium, these loans are often bought by French banks. The bank has a branch in the provincial capital, which is the only foreign bank in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>French ambitions in other areas of southwest China are not obvious. Since 1914, there has been a plan to build a railway along the coast between Guangzhou Bay in Guangdong Province and the Indochina border, through Guangxi and Yunnan Provinces, and reaching Chongqing via Xufu in Sichuan Province. The contract for this railway was negotiated between the former Beijing government and the Sino-French Industrial Bank. The bank even advanced some funds to the Beijing government. Later, the bank went bankrupt, and the funds were not repaid. The draft contract did not stipulate that the contract would be voided if the conditions were not fulfilled. To date, France has neither transferred the contract to another French company nor canceled it. Therefore, in addition to controlling the Yunnan Railway, France holds this vested right in the entire southwest and has a special geographical interest.</p>
<p>As for other countries, apart from Japan and China, most have conflicting interests with France's policy. The United Kingdom regards Burma and Tibet as protectorates and is also watching Sichuan with interest. All three places are adjacent to Yunnan. The Soviet Union considers Tibet a buffer state between Russia and British India and, of course, cannot ignore the future of Tibet. Therefore, France's Far Eastern empire and its imperialistic ambitions are deeply related to the balance of power in Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Huang Fu Passes Through Hankou to Jiangxi <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Visiting Chiang to Seek Instructions on North China Diplomacy</p>
<p>Tang Youren Travels East on the Dehe Steamer</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Huang Fu, Chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee, traveled south from Beiping on the 3rd to seek instructions from Chairman Chiang and President Wang on the diplomatic situation in North China, which is tense. Accompanying him were Secretary He Jiecai, Wang Dagang, Councilor Ge Chongxun, Gao Shiluan, and several attendants, as well as a platoon of soldiers from the 105th Division as escorts. He arrived in Hankou at 10:30 AM on the 5th. After Huang got off the train, he went to the Central Bank Building for a short rest. Zhang Xueliang and others crossed the river to visit him, exchanging views on the military and political situation in North China and consulting on some matters. That night at 8:00 PM, Huang took the Dehe steamer to Jiangxi. Tang Youren also traveled with him. Huang made a statement in Hankou, saying, "Due to various diplomatic and political matters in North China, I need to report to the Central Government, Chairman Chiang, and President Wang, and seek instructions on future policies. I took the train from Beiping to Hankou on the afternoon of the 3rd, and took the opportunity to visit Vice Commander Zhang to catch up. After visiting Chairman Chiang in Jiangxi, I will stay for about four days, then go to Nanjing to visit President Wang, stay in Nanjing for a week, and then return to Hangzhou via Shanghai to sweep the tombs. The estimated return trip will take about 40 days. In recent years, the administration and diplomacy in North China have been handled in accordance with the Central Government's consistent policies, and I still maintain this intention. Important passes on the Great Wall, such as Yuguan, have already been completely taken over. Currently, only passes such as Malanyu are still awaiting recovery. We will continue to negotiate. The issue of opening traffic and mail was raised and discussed several times by the Japanese side at the beginning of the Eastward takeover, but it was suspended due to disagreements. In the future, if we consult with the Japanese side on this matter, we will proceed on the principle of never violating the Central Government's principle of not recognizing the puppet organization and not splitting the four eastern provinces. The Japanese have recruited thousands of Chinese laborers to serve in the military. Because there is no clear identification, it is difficult to distinguish them. I have ordered them to be strictly guarded against. As for their reinforcement of troops in Chahar East, the fact is very obvious. Inner Mongolian autonomy may be affected by this. However, the Bailingmiao Autonomous Political Affairs Committee is scheduled to be established at the end of this month, which is certainly sufficient to deal with the situation. The Tangshan labor unrest is currently being mediated and should come to an end within days and will not be expanded or prolonged. The unrest of plainclothes teams in Qingdao City is mostly composed of local hooligans. Perhaps there is some instigation from a certain party, but it is not known. The remnants of Sun Dianying's troops have been urged by the Jin-Sui army to reorganize, and they have complied. There should be no further disputes in the future. The Yutian Security Team is also being reorganized and should be completed in the short term. The security of North China is very consolidated, and everything can be reorganized step by step. The rumors that the Political Affairs Committee will expand its organization are absolutely untrue, and there is no need for it. After I leave Beiping, the affairs of the Political Affairs Committee will be handled by Secretary-General He Qigong on my behalf." Tang Youren also said, "This time I came to Hankou on the orders of President Wang to urge Shi Ying to return to Beijing to resume his duties. I visited Mayor Shi the day before yesterday and conveyed President Wang's sincere condolences and requests to stay. Mayor Shi has agreed to return to Beijing, but he needs to postpone it for a few days to take care of private affairs. I am busy with official duties, so I am returning east first. The situation in North China is not only diplomatically serious, but other situations are also very complicated. I have not yet fully understood the recent situation of the Ban Hong incident because I was on official business outside. At this time, when the borders are troubled and the crisis is urgent, only by improving internal affairs can we use diplomacy. I hope that everyone will work together to save the situation." It is heard that Huang Fu's trip south is indeed of important task, and it is rumored that Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi has postponed his return home to meet with Huang in Beijing. However, Huang made no comment on this in Hankou. (5th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Bandit Liu Occupies Ganyu, JiangSu <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>｜Wang Jun's Troops Strictly Guard Against the Escape of Remnant Bandits｜</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: After the remnant bandits of Liu Guitang occupied Ganyu County, Wang Jun, in addition to ordering Li Shilong's brigade, which was stationed on the eastern road, to suppress them, also went east by special train to Xin'an Town yesterday (the 4th) at noon to supervise the suppression. According to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Security Department, when the Liu bandits attacked Ganyu County on the 3rd, the Ganyu police force was weak. Upon hearing the news of the bandits' arrival, they were unable to hold on and withdrew outside the city, allowing the bandits to enter the city unopposed. However, behind the bandits, there was a Shandong army regiment that also pursued them into Ganyu. The bandits stayed in the county seat for one night and fled south on the morning of the 4th. At this time, the 7th Division troops sent by Wang Jun had already advanced north from Caopu and Baitabu stations to intercept the bandits. The bandits were impatient to fight and fled as soon as they were attacked. They turned back and fled north, and are now in Huandun, at the junction of Jiangsu and Shandong. The 7th Division troops are searching and suppressing Huandun from Shahe Shangdun. The Shandong army, which pursued the bandits towards Ganyu, is also converging on Huandun. They will be able to reach Huandun today to besiege them. Wang Jun has advanced from Xin'an Town to Niushan Station to command the suppression. Trenches have been dug and defensive fortifications have been built in Xinpu and Haizhou to prevent the bandits from escaping. As for the situation in Ganyu, it is heard that the bandits looted a lot of property in the city, and some of the police's weapons were confiscated. It is rumored that the county magistrate escaped when the bandits entered the city and has now returned to the county to deal with the aftermath. However, the details of the losses have not yet been confirmed. The eastern section of the Longhai Railway is operating as usual. After the 19th Brigade advanced north to pursue the bandits, the newly transferred 21st Brigade on the eastern road is heavily guarded along the line. Wang plans to telegraph Chiang Kai-shek if necessary to increase the number of troops to encircle and suppress the bandits, in order to completely eliminate them, and plans to request the dispatch of aircraft for reconnaissance and bombing.

<h3 id="e97">Autonomy is Promoted in Fujian Province <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs Orders All Counties to Handle Matters Within a Time Limit</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Li Zuyu, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, went to Jiangxi at the beginning of last month to attend the administrative meeting and handed over the affairs of the department to the chief secretary, Li Mo, to act as his agent. Now Li Zuyu has returned to Fujian from Jiangxi on the 3rd of this month. The next day, he attended the Provincial Government Committee meeting to report on the trip to Jiangxi. Regarding the future civil administration plan of this province, it is heard that special emphasis will be placed on promoting autonomy and dealing with the aftermath in the bandit areas. The autonomy of various counties in Fujian Province was ordered to be suspended by the puppet government, and many have not yet been restored. Now, the first phase of the local autonomy to be handled in various counties has been formulated, including four items: investigating the population, organizing neighborhoods, electing officials, and completing the Baojia system. They are limited to being completed within six months. In the second phase, major policies such as sanitation, education, afforestation, and road construction will be implemented. Once they are submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for approval, they can be ordered to be implemented in various counties.</p>
<p>Regarding the problem of dealing with the aftermath in the bandit areas, the Department of Civil Affairs has urged the various county magistrates to go to their posts with the army as soon as possible to preside over local administration. Administrative commissioners will be set up in the northern and western Fujian areas to supervise the county magistrates in handling the aftermath. The proposal to set up commissioners will also be submitted to the Provincial Committee Meeting and submitted to the Nanchang Headquarters for approval after it is passed. It can be implemented roughly next month. To relieve the people in the bandit areas, the first step is to revive the rural areas. The measures are all in accordance with those promulgated by the Nanchang Headquarters, which are (1) clearing land, (2) lending funds, (3) exempting old rents. (4th)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Huainan, Xiang, Hubei, West Anhui Four Shores Transportation Merchants Appeal <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Forcefully Argue the Key to Salt Transportation Interests</p>
<p>Hoping the Government Will Pay Attention to Relief</p>
<p>Huainan, Xiang, Hubei, West Anhui four shores transportation merchants, on the 3rd, sent an express mail telegram, the text reads: [Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Military Commission, Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Control Yuan, Examination Yuan, Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, Heads of various Yuan, various Commissioners, various Ministers, Provincial Government Chairman, Provincial Government Commissioners, all responsible superiors, all National Federation of Commerce, all public legal entities, all newspapers, respectfully, we merchants have gathered capital to operate salt transportation, spending tens of thousands in costs, enduring thousands of miles of wind and wave danger, accumulating stock for more than a year, to profit by mere pennies, enriching the national tax revenue above, and aiding people's food supply below. On one hand, we abide by the restrictions of laws and regulations, and on the other hand, we rely on the protection of laws and regulations. We uphold the law and serve the public, without exceeding this. Last year, the long-standing practice of allowing tax exemptions and transportation subsidies for salt loss was stopped. Merchants, fearful of the impermanence of natural disasters and man-made calamities, ran around appealing for rescue, waiting for months without a reply. This year, the new scale was adopted, with unclear distinctions between tare weight and salt weight. Shopkeepers took the opportunity to attack and withhold merchant capital. The audit offices on each shore even ordered competitive sales, advance tax payment, and price reductions. We have presented the difficulties and circumstances to the responsible superiors at all levels, but have not received solutions. The merchants' situation is urgent and difficult to advance or retreat. We dare to present the difficult points separately.</p>
<p>Xiang, Hubei, West Anhui do not produce salt. It is transported from afar, passing through the Yangtze River and large lakes to inland rivers, and then distributed to each shore. The circumstances are different from land transportation and short-distance resale in other provinces, or on-site collection. Although transportation subsidies are requested, the fact that for one dan of salt, half a dan of field tax is paid, and the price and freight of two dan of salt are used, is clearly evident in the hardship and fatigue. If the facts are doubted and everything is overturned due to the inability to conduct immediate investigation and inspection, then it is like refusing to eat for fear of choking, how can fairness and reason be obtained? Moreover, although salt is transported by merchants, it is actually sold by the government. The shore tax is collected from the shopkeepers who buy salt, not from the transportation merchants. If the salt is lost, where will the tax come from? Ships encountering danger is a common occurrence worldwide. Suffering losses from danger is already painful. If one is further required to compensate for the tax on goods not received by the person who bought the goods, no such system exists in any country in the world. Some say that insuring sail-transported salt is possible. However, cargo insurance only covers merchant capital. If field and shore taxes exceed the merchant capital by two or three times, which is unheard of for other goods, the insurance premium would be enormous, where would the funds come from? Moreover, on the Xiang shore, the inland river transfer, side shores, and rocky beaches are constantly dangerous, and the amount of salt stored and the weight of shore tax are unparalleled in other provinces. Between spring and summer, mountain floods break out, and the salt stored in warehouses is a constant concern. Companies are unwilling to insure it, and the situation is indeed difficult. If merchants are required to compensate for losses, then distributing to each shore will inevitably be difficult. The impact on the people's food supply and tax revenue will be enormous. It is requested that tax exemptions and transportation subsidies should still be granted for the amount of salt actually lost, which cannot be salvaged by human power.</p>
<p>As for the middle and west road side shores of the Xiang shore, dangerous shoals stand, and waterfalls are steep. Some are hundreds of miles away, others are thousands of miles away. Ships travel in the midst of chaotic stone peaks, pulled up purely by human power. Each ticket is divided into dozens of ships, and danger occurs in more than one ship or place. Therefore, it was previously stipulated that each ticket would be allowed a tax exemption and transportation subsidy for twenty loads, to show a limit. Even if there is more loss, the merchant pays the tax, which is actually due to the terrain and is not desired by the merchant. If the practice of allowing exemption for loss is abolished, it is requested that some funds be allocated from the fees collected from the belly shore for attaching to the side, along with the merchant capital, to provide subsidies. This is one.</p>
<p>Xiang, Hubei, and West three shores have always released salt using the Sima scale. Each load of tax salt is 100 catties, tare weight 5 catties, brine loss 4 catties. Upon arrival at the shore for sale, the local customary scale is used to weigh it out of the warehouse. The Sima scale is 100 catties, equivalent to more than 102 or 3 catties on the customary scale. The weight system is 16 taels and 8 mace per catty. According to Article 5 of the tax regulations, for tax measurement, each catty is allowed to add 8 mace of salt loss in addition to the legally defined 16 taels. This salt loss is to compensate the transportation merchant for the transportation responsibility. Merchants buy 100 catties of salt in the warehouse, which is equivalent to more than 107 catties on the local 16-tael scale. The 5 catties of tare weight is the salt loss that the transportation merchants should receive, which is transferred and issued to the merchants along with the scale. The 5 catties of tare weight outside the scale is moved into the remaining catties of the 320-load tax package, using the field tax to subsidize the merchants and collect the shore tax. However, Anhui shore has always clearly removed the tare weight, so each ticket pays 28 loads in excess. This year, the new scale is adopted, using the Sima scale 100 catties, converted to 127 catties on the market scale. The original scale surplus and the 8 mace of salt loss used to offset the tare weight are all included in the regular catties for taxation. Hengshan merchants in Hunan said that the transportation merchants were using tare as salt, and attacked with telegrams, withholding merchant capital. Now the entire province's weight system is limited to a unified time. Merchants buy and sell salt catties, using the same market scale for entry and exit. For the price of 100 catties, they get 94 catties of salt. It is feared that the public will also raise objections. It is requested that the weight of tare be clearly removed for each load to prevent disputes. The Sima scale 5 catties of tare weight must be removed and given to the merchants, and the 8 mace of salt loss per catty and the scale surplus converted from the original Sima scale customary scale are all incorporated into the regular load, collecting field and shore taxes. The surplus salt from the previous 320 loads of shore tax payment is now eliminated due to consolidation, and there are no more surplus catties to speak of. However, the 8 mace of merchant capital was originally collected at 1,600 taels per 100 catties. Now it is reduced based on 1,680 taels, which has disappeared in effect. Moreover, the field tax within the 320 loads that subsidizes the merchants is again moved into 5 loads for collection. Since the facts have changed, the merchant capital should be determined. This is two.</p>
<p>Merchants transport salt and often prepare for more than half a year, up to eighteen or nineteen months, because sales have a fixed time and price, which can be estimated in advance. Even if there is a loss, it is limited. The Hubei shore abolished the method of full-round guaranteed price and reduced prices for competitive sales. In one year, merchants lost more than a hundred thousand. Now the Xiang audit office is ordering it to be implemented in Xiang. Merchants in Xiang, seeing the situation in Hubei, are panicked as if a great disaster is about to occur. It is believed that the merchant capital on the four shores, since the regulations of the second year of the Republic of China, has been more than three yuan per 100 catties for more than twenty years. Compared with the increase in livelihood over the past twenty years and the need for transportation costs, it is impossible to reduce the price again. Only because there is too much salt in stock, speculators use this to estimate the sales of other merchants, and those who come later push forward, and those who come earlier suppress those who come later, taking away the interest on other merchants' stocks, under the name of price reductions, without reducing their inherent merchant capital. Merchants who should be sold in rounds have been storing in warehouses for a long time, and the interest on the stock is heavy. Suddenly, those who come later reduce prices and occupy their sales, and the longer they are suppressed, the more losses they incur. As a result, they will inevitably follow the price reduction, and because of the competitive sales, they have to be held hostage by the shopkeepers. In addition to the price reduction, they are followed by long-term credit. Once the credit is abused, bad debts increase. The Hubei shore has become a lesson, how can it be repeated on the Xiang, West, and Anhui shores, and make them follow in their footsteps, open the door to competition, open the road to speculation, eliminate established methods, and merchants lose protection. Who will transport and store tens of thousands of merchant capital in shore warehouses for more than ten months, causing endless trouble? Powerful people compete in speculation, transport only after sales are completed, and the warehouse has no storage for a month. The people suffer from light food, and the field and shore tax revenue is increasingly insufficient. If there is an emergency, there is no borrowing. What is the benefit of official and merchant difficulties? If it is said that this can promote sales, it is also felt that it is not. Salt is food, a little is not allowed, and more is not possible. The hinterland originally belongs to Huai sales, without the encroachment of neighboring private sales. The people do not eat more because of the cheap price, and the sales will not increase as a result. If the remote areas are flooded with smuggled salt, the reduction of several cents of merchant capital cannot compete. The government's expenses have regular monthly payments. If advance tax payment is used to stimulate a temporary increase, borrowing from the future, how will it be sustained in the future? The regular way of tax administration should not be like this. It is requested to withdraw the order for competitive sales, advance tax payment, and price reduction, and still order the method of guaranteed list price for sales in order, to stabilize commerce. This is three.</p>
<p>The above points are all important keys to salt transportation. Now, fortunately, salt affairs officials from various provinces are meeting in the capital to discuss the gains and losses of salt administration. Merchants have sent representatives to Beijing to petition, and dare to present the advantages and disadvantages in detail to the intelligent ears. It is hoped that you will grant a review, preside over political justice, to maintain salt transportation and protect tax revenue, and cannot bear the urgency of awaiting orders. Huainan, Xiang, Hubei, West Anhui four shores transportation merchants kowtow. ]</p>

<h3 id="e99">Anhui Chamber of Commerce Again Requests Verification and Reduction of Salt Tax <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu correspondence, after the Ministry of Finance implemented the new scale for salt catties, merchants in Anhui province have repeatedly appealed to allow the salt price to be reduced according to the shortage of catties in the new scale, but have not been approved. The Provincial Chamber of Commerce, because the local chambers of commerce are still requesting, yesterday submitted a detailed statement to the Ministry of Finance, detailing the advantages and disadvantages, and requesting verification and reduction to relieve the people's difficulties. The original text is as follows: [This chamber of commerce sent a telegram on January 12 of this year, requesting that the Ministry convert the salt catties to the new market scale and reduce the salt price. The Ministry replied in telegram 30, stating that the telegram was received, and the matter had been reported by the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce and others. It was stated that the conversion to the new scale was a uniform procedure in various provinces, and the request to reduce the new market scale salt price according to the Sima scale salt price should not be discussed. It was replied in the case that matters concerning laws and regulations should be properly persuaded and diligently followed. It was intended to entrust the relevant responsibilities to the affiliated chambers of commerce in Anhui province, and to give guidance in accordance with telegram 30. Now, the various chambers of commerce have stated that the conversion of salt catties to the new market scale is an expression of implementing the new system of weights and measures. Therefore, the Ministry's advisory document No. 202 states that the salt affairs and tax affairs agencies under the Ministry have always used only measuring instruments for the assessment of goods, which is easier to prepare and should be converted as soon as possible to promote it. It can be seen that the conversion to the new scale is not for the purpose of increasing taxes, but now the reform of the weight system has become a hidden increase in the tax rate, which is incomprehensible. Salt is a necessary food for the entire population, and the increase in salt prices makes the poor suffer even more. Therefore, in the middle of the Qing Dynasty, the minister requested to increase the price by three or four coins per catty, and the upright frontier minister insisted that it was not possible. Now, with the conversion to the new market scale, the price is increased by more than sixty or seventy coins per catty, without the approval of the Legislative Yuan, increasing the suffering of the poor. Even if it becomes a law, this is incomprehensible. The implementation of the new system should be based on laws and regulations. Now, according to the weight system recorded in the Weights and Measures Law, one is the standard system and the other is the market system. Article 11 stipulates that the market system is only allowed to be temporarily used between private buying and selling transactions. As for the government tax collection agencies, they should of course implement the standard system. However, why can the customs adopt the standard system kilogram scale, and the salt affairs audit office use the market scale for releasing scales and collecting taxes, which is only temporarily used in private buying and selling transactions? It has gone beyond the law, but it is still said that it concerns laws and regulations, which is incomprehensible. For the sake of rectifying salt affairs and averaging the burden, the tax rate of 20 yuan or more has been reduced to 10 yuan, and those with 10 yuan or more will be gradually improved. However, after the six counties in Huizhou implemented the new market scale, each load was clearly reduced by 6 cents and 7.6 mils and secretly increased by 1 yuan and 1 cent and 9.6 mils. Before long, they ordered each load to increase the price by 4 cents and 6 mils. Only increases are seen, and no reductions are heard. Is it that the tax rates in the past were all below the legal limit, so it is necessary to add both openly and secretly to average the burden? This is incomprehensible. In short, since the revolution, additional taxes have been added to salt catties on the Anhui shore. For example, the temporary additional tax in the 16th year of the Republic of China was two yuan per stone, the additional Northern Expedition fee in the 17th year of the Republic of China was one yuan and five cents per load, the construction fee in the 18th year of the Republic of China was one dime per load, and the listed price in the 20th year of the Republic of China was three dimes per load. Most of them are temporary in nature and should be abolished uniformly when rectifying salt administration, and the people should start anew. Moreover, in this autumn of rural bankruptcy and economic depression, how can we increase the burden on merchants and the people? Your chamber is responsible for maintaining the market and requesting the government to maintain responsibility. Please do not avoid axes and cutwords, and immediately present the matter. Please reduce the salt price according to the shortage of salt catties to benefit the whole people, etc. It is found that the people in various places only know that the salt tax has been clearly ordered to be reduced, but they cannot clearly understand the content of secretly increasing the salt price by changing the scale. Therefore, when buying salt from sub-stores, disputes often arise due to increased value, and there is even a fear of not being able to sell salt in many places. It is necessary to provide relief to avoid affecting the whole people. This chamber of commerce has already received earnest requests from local merchants and the people, and has to risk petitioning the Ministry to consider that the additional burden on the Anhui shore is already heavy, and to allow the salt price to be reduced according to the shortage of catties in the new scale to benefit the poor and stabilize commerce. We cannot bear the urgency of awaiting orders. ] (3rd)</p>

<p>Cotton Control Association Investigates Cotton Weaving</p>
<p>Songyi is a cotton-producing area. Historically, cotton fabrics manufactured in Song include yarn blankets, cotton socks, and towels. Yarn blankets and socks are particularly popular. However, due to years of turmoil and social and economic panic, sales have plummeted. Small-scale factories have closed down one after another, and manufacturers with some capital have also suffered heavy losses due to accumulated inventory and poor sales, affecting people's livelihoods. Recently, the Cotton Industry Control Group of the National Economic Commission sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, stating that it will send personnel to Song to investigate cotton textiles and requesting assistance and facilitation. Today, the association sent Wang Bohua and Mr. Ma to Song to state the investigation mission, saying that they intend to improve various cotton textiles with American cotton. The current investigation includes the categories, costs, and sales of cotton textiles, and what taxes and levies are levied along the way, to provide a basis for improvement and to develop the revival of industry to save and strengthen our country.</p>

<p>Gu Renfa's Three Summons Not Received, Court Decides to Arrest and Interrogate</p>
<p>Since the Liu Zhuomin case occurred, involving Li Shuyun, the wife of former Jiangsu Provincial Civil Affairs Commissioner Gu Renfa, and her daughter, it has also aroused various cases of bigamy and fraud by Gu, causing public outcry. Gu Renfa, who was subjected to criticism from all walks of life, knew the difficulty and retreated. The situation has been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that in the previous (4th) day of the court session, although Gu Renfa did not personally come to the court after being summoned, he sent a letter to the prosecutor's office. The original text stated, (omitted above) The Director of this Office is going to Gan to listen to instructions, and the Office's affairs are complicated, so he cannot personally appear in court. Please, the Prosecutor's Office, handle it in accordance with Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law, or Article 94 of the same law, so that both judicial and administrative affairs can benefit. Please check, etc. However, according to a certain legal scholar, Gu Renfa accused Li Shuyun of selling official positions and extorting money, and Gu was actually in the position of an accuser, and it was of a personal nature, which does not meet the above provisions. Moreover, Gu has resigned, so what is the complexity of the Office's affairs? Therefore, it is predicted that the prosecutor's office will summon Gu Renfa again, requiring him to come to court for questioning. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Mr. Yang Tianji, a member of the Supervisory Committee who came to Wuxi the day before yesterday. According to the talk, the author and Commissioner Duan came to Wuxi this time for sightseeing purposes. However, when departing from Beijing, they received instructions from Director Yu on two matters: 1. The Gu-Li case is complicated, and the court must handle it according to the law, without any favoritism or leniency, and not be surrounded or constrained by any party. 2. Officials bear the same responsibility in criminal matters as civilians, and can be summoned according to the law. If they fail to appear after three summons, they can be arrested and dealt with according to the law. Please inform the court immediately. As for the proposal to impeach, because the case is currently under judicial investigation, it is not convenient to express any opinions. Moreover, according to the impeachment rules, impeachment cases cannot be published before they are sent to the Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee. However, according to my personal opinion, this time Gu Renfa trapped his wife in prison and sacrificed a weak woman, although it is not a pity, but with the position of director, he used such means, which is morally ruined and nothing is left. Moreover, for every criminal event, there must be evidence before it can be handled according to the law. Now Gu Renfa began to search for evidence in many ways after Li Shuyun was arrested, which is obviously intentional. Looking at the current embarrassing situation, it is completely exposed, and general public opinion also expresses sympathy for the weaker. However, since we express sympathy for the weaker, please do not excessively publicize it in the newspapers, so as not to be detrimental to the weaker. After talking to this point, the reporter resigned and left. At 10:30 yesterday morning, Li Wenhua, the uncle of Li Shuyun, went to the detention center again to meet Shuyun and discuss everything. Shuyun also entrusted Li Wenhua to deliver the application for bail written by lawyer Chao Kun to the receiving and dispatch office, requesting approval for bail, and summoning Gu for questioning, whether there is any suspicion of false accusation. It is now heard that the prosecutor's office has decided to summon Gu Renfa three times. If Gu fails to appear again, it will issue an arrest warrant according to the law and order Gu Renfa to be arrested and interrogated. As for Huang Xutan, the captain of the Junhe warship in the first district of the Water Police, who had previously delivered 200 yuan to Li Shuyun in Shanghai on Gu's order, the prosecutor's office entrusted the Shanghai Special Zone Court a few days ago to summon Huang Xutan to come to Wuxi to testify. The court session was at 1:00 p.m. on April 6, but Huang was still in Zhenjiang yesterday and did not come to Wuxi to appear in court and testify.</p>
<p>Continuing to inquire, Li Shuyun and her daughter were bailed out by Li Wenhua Chao Kun yesterday (6th) and took a car to Shanghai that night.</p>

<p>The female workers in the weaving and spinning departments of the Qinfeng Textile Factory's first workshop in Zhoushanbang, this county, went on strike due to the factory's excessive fines. Both labor and management have petitioned the party and government agencies for relief. For the sake of public order, the county government, in addition to sending Zhang Yu, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, to investigate, also ordered the county police team to maintain order at the factory. At about 4:00 p.m. on the 5th, the night shift female workers of the factory happened to be going to work, and the police closed the alley gates, refusing them to go to work. The female workers were furious and uttered obscenities, saying, [You are all capitalist running dogs]. Then some people threw stones at the police officers, and another group of female workers, holding chamber pots, clashed with the police officers. For a time, the order was chaotic. In a fierce battle, the thigh of female worker Zhou Aying was stabbed by a police officer with a bayonet, bleeding profusely and unable to move. The other four people, Yu Rendi, Liu Yuxian, Chen Sanmei, and Bao Afeng, were also beaten with gun butts, and their heads were bleeding. The situation was pitiful. There was also a male worker, Xu Ajin, who was also injured. The storm led to expansion. That night, the injured female workers were carried to the county government, requesting an injury verification and requesting that the perpetrators be arrested and brought to justice. They were stopped by the gatekeepers, who told them to handle it tomorrow. Yesterday (6th), all the workers of the factory went on strike, and a female worker, Bao Afeng, was placed under the supervision of the county government. At 9:00 a.m., all the workers held a discussion meeting at the Dunrenli Textile Industry Union, and decided to go to the county government to petition, demanding the release of the arrested female worker Bao Afeng. The matter was learned by the county party headquarters, and it telegraphed the association to suspend the proceedings. At 1:00 p.m., the association invited Ye Qin Ding Heling, Shenxin Pan Quanbao, Li Guisheng, Guangqin Zhao Xiongfei, Chen Can Gen, Yukang Hu Tiankai, Wang Genbao, and more than a dozen others to hold an emergency joint meeting of various factory textile factories, deciding that the offices of each factory should provide assistance in unison, proceeding in three steps: the first step is to publish a notice in the newspaper to inform the factories to provide assistance, and the second and third steps will be discussed at a meeting depending on the development of the situation to discuss coping strategies. Currently, the workers have agreed to resume work after being persuaded by both the party and the government, but the factory is firm and unwilling to start work, and must stop for a week or two weeks, and stated that when necessary, they will use hard-line measures to replace all the workers. In order to solve the labor strike, the county party headquarters also held a meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday with Ye Dezhen, secretary of the county government, and Yao Fusheng, a clerk, to discuss mediation principles.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Bizarre Murder Case Occurs in Xizhai <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Lu A'mei, a hired worker of Zou Jiazhen, a resident of Xizhai in the second district, was 37 years old and unmarried. He worked diligently on weekdays. Zou Juntai, a clansman of the Zou family, is a local rich man and is currently the head of the security corps. There are many servants in the house, including a male servant named A'jia, who is in his twenties. He and A'mei were close friends, but A'jia was fond of gambling. In January of this year, he lost a lot of money, so he took the opportunity to steal the host's crepe quilt and pawned it to A'mei for one yuan. In the middle of this month, A'mei was drying the quilt on the field, but it was spotted by Zhang Ganyun, the wife of Juntai. Zhang asked A'mei, who said that A'jia had pawned it to me. Zhang went home and planned to question A'jia, but A'jia had disappeared. Zhang then accused A'mei of colluding in theft and informed Juntai of the situation. Juntai then led a group of corps members to privately torture A'mei to force a confession. Later, the villagers became suspicious because A'mei suddenly disappeared. It was not until about 11:00 a.m. on the 4th of this month that the body was suddenly found in the rice bin of Zou Juntai's house. The body was contorted, the head was swollen, and there was a white waist band around the neck. Zou Shiling, the head of the map in the area, reported to the county prosecutor's office on the previous day, requesting an autopsy. Yesterday (6th) afternoon, Prosecutor Shen led officials to the countryside for an autopsy.</p>

<p>Li Wengong, director of the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau, submitted a request to the county government for five days of leave after Gu Renfa, director of the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, resigned, to visit the provincial chairman and request resignation. Before leaving, he instructed the section chiefs of each section and the chief inspector to quickly complete the closing procedures, indicating that he would no longer return to Xixi to serve. However, the officials of the Inspectorate have been working hard on various cases of opium and gambling for days. In addition, since County Magistrate Yan resigned twice, the provincial government, considering that the improvement of general administration at this time depends on experienced hands to assist, still asked him to do his best and not to resign. After the order was sent to Xixi, County Magistrate Yan's intention to resign was still not dispelled, and he said that he personally felt that his interests did not match the county administration life, and he urgently needed to get rid of it to change the environment, and decided to go to the province to resign in person, and he was determined to leave.</p>

<p>Zhou Fuchen, the younger brother of Zhou Heng, the county magistrate of this county, is currently the director of the Miscellaneous Tax Section of the county government. He previously had an affair with Shen Xiao A'bao, a ship girl who came from Yixing. He initially planned to take her as a concubine, but his wife refused, so he abandoned her. Xiao A'bao was pregnant and had nowhere to go. On the one hand, she was under the power of the yamen and did not dare to argue, so she was very depressed. On the 31st of last month, she committed suicide by swallowing red pill ash. Fearing that the situation would escalate, the county magistrate ordered his brother to give her some expenses and ordered his father to transport her back to her hometown for burial. It is now learned that Xiao A'bao, after taking a large amount of poison, went to the county government and entered Zhou Fuchen's bedroom, intending to die there. Fearing that it would cause trouble, Zhou drove her back to the boat and hired a doctor, Zhou Mansun, to go to the boat for emergency treatment, but it was ineffective and she died. Now, Shen and others have been ordered to return to their hometown and have buried their daughter, but because Zhou is the younger brother of the county magistrate, he should not abandon her after having his way with her, so they plan to apply for judicial relief. County Magistrate Zhou Heng learned of this and, because it was related to his personal status, took the name of returning home to sweep the tombs and asked the provincial government for leave to return to his hometown in Yixing. In fact, he was mediating and mediating the matter. Zhou returned to Yixing on the 6th and planned to contact Shen Dalin, the father of the deceased, and give him generous compensation, instructing him to terminate the lawsuit and write to various newspapers in Shanghai and Changzhou to correct the previous news.</p>

County Magistrate Cai investigated that Yaotang Town had been looted and the losses in the Chengzhang Town robbery were also heavy. The cases were all serious and were planned to be sentenced to death. The provincial government approved the execution, and the two criminals were signed and brought to justice on the afternoon of the 5th, verifying their identities, and tied to the Fengweidun execution ground to be executed by shooting.</p>

<h3 id="e109">(Special Feature) The Terror of Yellow Trade Translated by Yang Deheng <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Original article published in Tbe Neue Weltbubqe, Praga LiberalWeekly, German,</p>
<p>Summarized and translated by Max Rudert in Readers Dizest,</p>
<p>Japan's terror to world trade can be seen in the following price list. The one who holds the reins in the world market must of course be able to sell cheaper than his competitors. And the selling price of Japan in the European market can be roughly distinguished, with the following numbers:</p>
<p>X X</p>
<p>Electric light bulbs at two and a half cents each, in gold dollars</p>
<p>Men's socks at four and a half cents each</p>
<p>Gold nib fountain pens at seven and a half cents each</p>
<p>Nine-piece coffee set at forty-nine cents per set</p>
<p>Bicycles at four dollars and fifty-six cents each</p>
<p>Her cotton fabrics can be 40% to 70% lower in cost than European factory products. For example, the selling price of Japan's best rayon in Marseille is lower than the yarn price in Lyon. One can imagine that a European industrialist once said, "Even if my raw materials were stolen and my labor costs unpaid, I'm afraid I still couldn't compete with this price."</p>
<p>This astonishingly low selling price is also due to their long working hours, low wages, and the systematic 60% inflation of the Japanese yen. The remuneration for workers working ten to twelve hours a day is as follows:</p>
<p>Coal miners, 26 cents</p>
<p>Silk weaving workers, 35 cents</p>
<p>Mechanics, 81 cents</p>
<p>Potters, 53 cents</p>
<p>Match workers, 33 cents</p>
<p>In addition, child labor over the age of ten, which is allowed in Japan, also occupies a considerable position in the domestic labor force, working ten to twelve hours a day for only four cents.</p>
<p>Forced labor, endurance of hunger, and simple living, like the children of the aforementioned child labor, coupled with modern production tools, the power of this youngest capitalist is expanding in the world, comparatively making the economic means of the Chinese unable to come to the fore. From 1932 to 1933, she had nine large-scale new factories producing rayon. Other industries also progressed unbelievably, all benefiting from the highest gains of modern industry. The following is her average analysis of various industries from 1932 to 1933 - years of recession in various countries around the world:</p>
<p>Industrial Classification Percentage</p>
<p>Cement and paper 12.9</p>
<p>Steel 13.5</p>
<p>Machinery 15.1</p>
<p>Yarn factories 18.2</p>
<p>Woolen fabrics 23.1</p>
<p>Rayon 24.9</p>
<p>This analysis is not inferred from her domestic market. The weakness of her people's purchasing power had to force her to take the path of challenging dumping. In her "Ten-Year Export Plan", subsidized by the government, she is preparing to deal with the world market. Indeed, it is now developing brilliantly. Export agencies have established associations to study the needs of foreign markets and the tariffs of various countries. Sales departments have been established in key areas, causing the whole world to be hit by her shockingly low prices. Recently, in British-controlled territories such as Australia, New Zealand, the Straits Settlements, India, etc., there have already been alarming effects. Although Britain is doing its best to oppose the Japanese trade invasion, she is still resolutely proceeding. The import of Indian cotton fabrics has increased fivefold, and yarn has increased fourfold.</p>
<p>The same is true in Africa. From Cape Town in the far south, Japanese salesmen can be found everywhere, all the way to the Congo and Abyssinia. In the first seven months of 1933, of the 870,000 yards of rayon imported into Tanganyika, 800,000 yards were exported from Japan. As for the Near East, especially Iraq, Persia, and Egypt, Japan has successful markets.</p>
<p>The British market has suffered the most damage and is struggling to survive under this full-scale dumping. Raising tariffs has only resisted her weakest points. If she further increases her protective tariffs, then when London increases its demands to curb Japanese low-priced goods, Japan will issue a warning note to Britain, saying that it will no longer buy cotton from India or Australia, but will procure it from South America. However, since the wool industry in Australia and the cotton industry in India have been in recession due to changes in their economic status, Japanese goods are voluntarily promoted in the British market regardless of price.</p>
<p>Japan's operations are almost as alarming everywhere. According to the statistics of foreign trade recently released by Tokyo in 1932, one can see:</p>
<p>Market Percentage Increase</p>
<p>Asia 59.3</p>
<p>Europe 29.3</p>
<p>North America 28.5</p>
<p>Central America 41.3</p>
<p>South America 21.8</p>
<p>Africa 96.2</p>
<p>Australia 76.9</p>
<p>This represents an average increase of 51 percent. At the same time, the world's commerce has also suffered this loss.</p>
<p>Japan is organizing a Central European Trade Bureau in Vienna, so her power will invade the markets of the Balkan Peninsula, Central Europe, and Southern Europe. A large-scale warehouse is being built, preparing to store large quantities of cotton, wool, silk, rayon, steel, rubber, celluloid, porcelain, paper goods, as well as light bulbs, auto parts, bicycles, and other goods. From then on, there will be one more promotion center. The increase in protective tariffs, which is most feared by other countries, does not hinder the old goods. Barren countries have conditions for exchanging goods with Japan. Japan is a country that does not export agricultural products, which can give it a lot more benefits than other industrialized countries.</p>
<p>But to come back to the point, the final systematic results of Japan cannot take her initial success as a standard. Japanese imperialists lack coal and minerals. This lack makes her finally weak, just like her excessive exports. Germany and Britain never export a quarter of their total production, and the United States exports no more than 10 to 12 percent, while Japan has reached 60 percent. This large-scale invasion of the world trade market contains the seeds of its own destruction. Her foundation may be shattered in this situation. The outward appearance of alarm is only a manifestation of the most rabid achievements of her people. In political and military terms, Japan also has various difficulties and terrors. The relationship with the United States and the Soviet Union has also reached a serious symbolic point.</p>
<p>Japan is like a cauldron, and its pressure is constantly rising. Within ten years, her population has increased from 56,000,000 to 66,000,000. With the help of the government, a large industrial base has been established, and manic exports are also progressing. Will Japan stop - or will it inevitably - before social disintegration occurs on her overpopulated island? Her current military aggression against Manchuria, the annual military defense spending of 1,200,000,000 yuan, and the tendency towards frenzied Fascism are not expressions of her rising image? An old Japanese proverb also says, "It is difficult to get off the back of a tiger."</p>

After getting off the train, Chen went to He's residence on Lafayette Road to rest. At about 10:00 AM, he met Zhou Zuomin, manager of Jin Cheng Bank, at He's residence for negotiations. He also attended a banquet hosted by Zhou at noon. Dr. Rajchman, a special commissioner of the League of Nations to China for technical cooperation, is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Europe next week to attend the League of Nations Administrative Conference and the League of Nations and China Technical Cooperation Special Committee held in Geneva to report on the situation of technical cooperation in China.

<p>According to business circles yesterday, after the exchange of tung oil and tea between China and Russia was suspended, the International Trade Bureau contacted Poland to exchange 4 million yuan of tea from Wuning, Jiangxi Province, for Polish goods. Yesterday, the Polish Embassy sent a counselor to meet with He Bingxian, director of the International Trade Bureau. No definite method has been obtained for the number and exchange method, but from other aspects, it is still difficult for the International Trade Bureau to handle this matter, because Polish goods are not only high in price, but the people do not need Polish cotton and silk fabrics at all, and the number of Polish goods shipped to China has always been very small.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Investigation of Imported Foreign Sugar <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Annual Amount Reaches 14 Million Piculs, Worth 100 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry Plans to Persuade Overseas Chinese to Invest in Restoring Domestic Sugar</p>
<p>China's sugar industry used to be very developed. Later, due to the cession of Taiwan and the impact of the recession, the output gradually declined. In addition, foreign sugar took the opportunity to import and arbitrarily lowered prices to dump, causing China's sugar industry to be on the verge of collapse. According to investigations by the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and the customs, the largest import volume of foreign sugar each year reaches 14 million piculs, worth more than 100 million yuan, ranking second among foreign imports. In order to restore the domestic sugar industry and recover rights and interests, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo plans to consult with overseas Chinese tycoons on investment methods during his upcoming visit to the Nanyang Islands, so as to first restore the sugar industry in Min, Yue, Qiongya, Chaozhang, and the Sichuan River, and then set up large-scale sugar factories to restore and recover rights and interests.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Danger to Chinese Copper Skin Factories Under Japanese Dumping <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Request for Government to Devise Relief Measures</p>
<p>The copper skin raw materials needed by China's hardware industry have always relied on imports, especially from Japan. Since Chinese people in Shanghai established the Zhonghua, Nanchang, Shanghai, Qixing, Huaxing, and Zhongguo copper skin factories, they have recovered considerable interests. Because the quality of domestic products is excellent and the prices are low, factories such as flashlight, thermos bottle, lock, and hardware factories are happy to use them. The manufactured goods are also more durable than foreign goods. Therefore, in the midst of this national product's vigorous development, foreign goods will gradually disappear. Unexpectedly, the Japanese are unwilling to give up their original position and adopt a dumping policy, selling at all costs to compete with Chinese merchants. Unscrupulous merchants are also taking advantage of this, importing large quantities privately, causing the business of various Chinese factories to plummet. In the near future, it is feared that all factories that need copper skin will be invaded by Japanese goods. In such a situation, how can the future not be dangerous? It is now heard that Mr. Yu Zhongnan, manager of the Zhonghua Copper Factory, seeing this crisis, has initiated a joint effort with all the copper factories in Shanghai to submit a petition to the government requesting relief measures. Yesterday, letters were sent to various copper factories to solicit opinions in order to proceed. The original letter is recorded below. We respectfully inform you that since the Japanese bandits occupied the Northeast, all Chinese people have been indignant. Everyone agrees that fundamental resistance is necessary to save us from danger. Fortunately, in the past two years, all businesses have been able to work hard to survive, and some progress has been made. The copper skin business, which has been monopolized by Japanese merchants for many years, has also seen a glimmer of hope. Unexpectedly, Japanese merchants have recently taken advantage of the decline in our market conditions and are unwilling to give up their original position, selling cheaply at a loss. The merchants who need copper skin are again greedy for profit and forget their hatred, and continue to import privately. Our copper industry has suffered a huge blow, and the impact is very profound. If we do not urgently seek remedies, the future crisis will be even more unimaginable. I deeply feel the pain and am concerned about my fellow countrymen. I plan to jointly petition the government for relief with various copper factories. You are a senior in the business world and have great patriotic enthusiasm. You must have many insightful views on this matter. If you agree, please give us your opinion so that we can schedule a meeting to discuss a good plan.</p>

<h3 id="e125">The Mechanical Industry Association Submitted Two Important Petitions to the Ministry of Industry and the Municipal Government Yesterday <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Requesting that Government-Funded Students Translate What They Have Learned to Benefit the Chinese People</p>
<p>Proposing Reforms to Municipal Road Administration and Water and Electricity Services</p>
<p>The Shanghai Mechanical National Products Factory Association submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry yesterday, requesting that government-funded students translate what they have learned into Chinese in order to improve industry and commerce. At the same time, it also submitted a petition to the municipal government, proposing reforms to municipal road administration and water and electricity services. The original petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition to the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Petition for a matter. It is learned that the member Zhong Xuezhun of the Hezhong Machinery Factory stated in a letter that China's industry is backward and the people lack places for scientific research. It is requested that the government be requested to issue an order that after government-funded students studying abroad return to China, they should translate the courses they have learned into Chinese so that the Chinese people can engage in research. First, they can publicize their own skills; second, they can promote China's industrial production to become scientific; and third, they can increase the scientific knowledge of the Chinese people, so that they will not fail the country's cultivation of talents and the expectations of the Chinese people. The matter concerns the study of scientific industry, and it is reasonable to report the situation and request that your ministry review it and approve its implementation for the public convenience.</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Petition for a matter. It is learned that the member Zhong Xuezhun of the Hezhong Machinery Factory stated in a letter that the existence of factories in the concessions is sufficient to revitalize the market, and the Municipal Council should welcome it. Why is it suppressing it instead? The land price in the concessions is very expensive. Why are Chinese factories not located in the Chinese area but in the concessions? The reason is nothing more than that water, electricity, transportation, and protection are not yet properly arranged. (1) Water and electricity are both in Shanghai, separated by a boundary line, and the prices are different. The electricity meters are also inaccurate. The salaries of important employees of the water and electricity companies in the concessions are around 1,000 yuan, while the salaries of employees of the water and electricity companies in the Chinese area are only around 100 yuan, but the electricity prices are more expensive than in the concessions. (2) The concessions build roads, and many of them are built to the Chinese area, but the construction of roads in the Chinese area is slow. (3) The government should find ways to protect factories and shops in the Chinese area, and not allow any destructive actions, and eliminate excessive taxes and miscellaneous taxes and various bad habits. If this matter can be resolved, not only will factories in the concessions move back one after another, but also residents in the Chinese area will be more numerous. Various industries will develop as a result, and the market will flourish and revitalize day by day. The matter concerns the revitalization of the market and the development of industry, and it is reasonable to report the situation and request that your government review it and decide to implement it for the public convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Ministry of Finance Replied to the Chamber of Commerce that the Import of Coconut Oil Will Not Be Subject to Tax Reduction <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting a reduction in the import tax on coconut oil to reduce the cost of manufacturing domestic soap. The original text has been recorded in previous reports. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance replied to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday: Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the telegram has been received and understood. The case for the Chinese Soap Industry Association requesting that the customs duty on coconut oil used for manufacturing soap be reduced by half has been reviewed by the National Tariff System Committee. The Ministry has re-examined that the tax rate for coconut oil in the current import tariff is 2.70 gold units per picul, which is based on the tariff of 20 years ago and has not increased. The actual percentage rate now levied is higher than before due to the fall in the price of goods. Generally, after the tax rate is set, the percentage rate is small when the price of goods rises, and the percentage rate is high when the price of goods falls. This is the situation that should exist for ad valorem tax rates. Although the percentage rate of coconut oil actually levied has increased, the amount of tax payable per picul has not increased in the slightest. Even manufacturers who use this kind of falling-price raw material will only benefit and not be harmed. Moreover, the investigation shows that the coconut oil used to manufacture soap accounts for only a small part of its raw materials, and the import of foreign soap has gradually decreased in recent years, which proves that the industry has not been affected by this. The request to reduce the import tariff on coconut oil by half is difficult to approve. Please inform the industry accordingly. Winter Seal of the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<p>Accounts for the Previous Year</p>
<p>Regarding the account report for the year 1933, the recurrent income of the ordinary budget for the year was 15,632,867 taels, and the expenditure was 15,613,270 taels, leaving a surplus of 19,597 taels. The tax revenue for the year was 728,263 taels short, of which the shortfall of 466,019 taels in Western-style house donation and the shortfall of 262,915 taels in Chinese-style house donation were the largest. Only the land tax had a surplus of 67,807 taels. However, although the shortfall reached more than 700,000 taels, the result was still a surplus, which was due to the strict savings implemented by all administrative departments. For example, the expenses of business groups, fire departments, police departments, health departments, and public works departments were all below the prescribed amount, and the public works department saved 357,165 taels and the health department saved 113,646 taels, which were the largest. The temporary expenditure budget for the year totaled 24,703,802 taels in income and 22,249,117 taels in expenditure, leaving a deficit of 3,545,375 taels, which has been included in this year's budget to make up for it. At that time, in addition to making a short-term loan of 2 million taels, no additional bonds were raised. Since the sale of the electricity office in 1929, the sale price of 81 million taels was cleared at the end of the previous year. This amount was used to repay 17 public debts, totaling 36,978,144 taels, and to allocate 10,619,640 taels to the debt repayment fund, and to pay 29,616,126 taels for various land purchases and construction costs over the past five years, leaving 3,786,090 taels to be included in the public debt temporary account, which matches the amount of 81 million taels.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Protest by the Guild of Bicycle Manufacturers and Sellers Against Increased Fees <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for Negotiation with the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai Guild of Bicycle Manufacturers and Sellers, due to the failure of negotiations regarding the increase in bicycle license fees by the Public Works Department, has sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, outlining the reasons for their protest and requesting efforts to overturn the original proposal, as well as forwarding it to the Municipal Government for negotiation. The reasons are quite sufficient, and the original letter is recorded as follows: To the esteemed members of the Chamber, Upon reading the newspaper, we learned that the Public Works Department of the Concession is increasing the bicycle license fee from three yuan to four yuan per year, and also collecting a magnetic tag fee. The motive for this proposal is a suggestion from the French Concession's Bureau of Public Works, requesting the Public Works Department of the International Settlement to do the same. The board of directors has already approved it, and it will be implemented from 1935. At the same time, starting from April 1st of this year, a magnetic tag fee of two jiao per item will be collected. When this news arrived, our guild was extremely shocked. It is unanimously believed that this move by the Public Works Department directly increases the burden on citizens and indirectly affects the business of bicycle merchants. We immediately sent separate letters to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai Concession, asking them to find a way to overturn the original proposal. Now we have received a letter from the Association, and the effect is equal to zero. After further discussion among our guild members, we believe that this matter is of utmost importance and we cannot remain silent. We dare to explain it to your esteemed Chamber. The rate of fees, whether increased or decreased, should be based on the general economic situation as a standard. This is true both in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Our city is currently in a period of industrial and commercial depression and economic recession. The general economy has reached an extreme state of hardship. Those who care about the overall situation are dedicated to the recovery plan, but the Public Works Department is proposing to increase fees, pursuing petty gains at the expense of reason. This, based on the current social situation, is absolutely unacceptable and should be protested, this is the first reason. It is found that the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany do not levy bicycle fees at all. France only levies thirteen francs per year, which allows travel throughout the country. Shanghai City originally did not have licenses. Since the Concession's Public Works Department levied fees in 1925, the fees have already been increased once. Moreover, within the Shanghai City area, riders must have at least two licenses to pass. The original fee rate is already higher than any other country. If we consider the price of bicycles, the current ordinary bicycle has a minimum value of less than twenty yuan. The Chinese Concession license fee is five yuan and five jiao per year, which is a rate of 27.5%. In addition, regardless of whether the license is obtained in December or even if the bicycle is ridden for only one day, the fee for the entire year must be paid. Consider the cars on the market worth thousands of yuan. Is the fee rate really 27.5%? If compared, the bicycle fee is even higher than any other vehicle. If it is increased again, can it be said to be fair? This is not in accordance with the principle of equality and should be protested, this is the second reason. According to regulations, the requirement of a bicycle license is originally a method for easy inspection and control, not for the purpose of tax revenue. This is not only admitted by the Public Works Department itself, but also evident in the fact that the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany do not levy fees, and France has a low rate. However, observing the estimates of the Director of Finance of the Public Works Department and the reasons he holds, it is no different from directly admitting that the increase in fees is for the sake of tax revenue. This is a self-contradiction in their words and deeds and should be protested, this is the third reason. As for the two points held by the Public Works Department [due to the convenience of the roads enjoyed by riders and the costs required for police management of traffic], they are difficult to consider as sufficient reasons for increasing fees. Bicycles weigh less than fifty pounds, occupy less than four square feet, travel quickly, and can be placed anywhere. They can be ridden even on rural dirt roads. They do not damage the roads, nor do they obstruct traffic. They do not require designated parking spaces like cars, or the construction of wooden sheds for rickshaws. The cost of police management of traffic is not difficult to imagine. In recent years, the Public Works Department has been increasing road repairs and expansions, as well as adding police traffic control equipment as a result of increasing revenue from cars, etc., and not for the convenience of bicycle riders. This is an undeniable fact. If these two points are used as a reason for increasing fees, then the number of bicycles in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany should exceed that of our city by a hundred times. They do not levy fees at all. Do they not need any expenses at all? Or is the management of bicycle traffic in the Shanghai Concession different from other countries? Are the costs required insufficient and must the fees be increased to compensate? The reasons they hold are self-defeating and should be protested, this is the fourth reason. Furthermore, among the more than 30,000 bicycles in our city, 95% are owned by Chinese people, and most of them are from the laboring class. Due to the abnormal development of the current society, soaring rents, and difficulties in making a living, they have no choice but to live in places far from the city. They use bicycles as transportation to and from work in order to save money. These people lack the ability to pay taxes, and the current fee rate is already unbearable. The Public Works Department should give them consideration and find ways to reduce their burden. Now, for vehicles weighing several tons, occupying a large area, easily damaging roads, obstructing traffic, and requiring control and management, there has been no increase in fees. Only the bicycle license fee of one yuan and the magnetic tag fee of two jiao are exacted to exploit the laboring class. Is there anything more unfair in the world than this? This is unequal treatment and should be protested, this is the fifth reason. As for the bicycle merchants in our guild, they pay alarming amounts of money to the Public Works Department. In this time of economic decline and business difficulties, they are already in a precarious situation. If the license fee is actually increased, making it unaffordable for the economically weak laboring class, they will inevitably abandon bicycles and seek other ways to save money. Sales will be hindered, and the reduction of any hope for survival is predictable. For the sake of maintaining the business of our guild, we must strive for this and protest, this is the sixth reason. Moreover, the Public Works Department did not give citizens and related parties sufficient time to consider the increase in bicycle license fees. Once an event is approved by the board of directors, it becomes a set case, leaving no room for protest. It seems that they can take whatever they want. Our tax-paying citizens will not be able to bear the burden. Learning from past mistakes and for the sake of public interest, this must be protested, this is the seventh reason. Furthermore, the Public Works Department currently collects vehicle license fees mostly on a monthly or quarterly basis. For car licenses, if they are discontinued before the expiration date, there is the convenience of refunding the fee. However, bicycle licenses are stipulated to be collected for the entire year. The two methods are extremely unfair. Not only do riders constantly suffer retroactive sacrifices, but our guild also suffers from the lack of sales in autumn and winter, which is extremely painful. In December of the 20th year of the Republic of China, we requested the Chinese Concession authorities to improve this and collect fees on a quarterly basis. Unexpectedly, it was considered that the reasons stated were insufficient to change the basis for collecting fees and were not approved. We believe that business difficulties are even more severe now than in the past, and the various situations of bicycles are as described above, indicating that not only is there no possibility of increasing fees, but there is actually a need for improvement. If we discuss the quarterly method, with the current fee rate of three yuan, on average, those who obtain a license from January 1st to March should still pay three yuan. Those who obtain a license between April and June should deduct one-quarter (i.e., seven jiao and five fen), and actually pay two yuan and two jiao and five fen. The reduction should be made accordingly in autumn and winter. If this is implemented, it will be balanced and avoid the harm of being biased. This is the unanimous proposal of our guild and must be urgently requested. We have always admired the leaders of your esteemed Chamber, who have shown great care. We are sending this special letter to inform you. We sincerely ask you to uphold justice and quickly negotiate with the Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the Bureau of Public Works of the French Concession, based on reason, to not only overturn the original proposal to increase fees but also achieve the goal of collecting the current fee rate on a quarterly basis. We also ask you to forward it to the Shanghai Municipal Government for assistance and send a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai Concession to include it in the agenda of this year's conference for public discussion. Then the citizens will be fortunate, and our guild will be fortunate. We ask that you examine and approve this, and we will all be grateful. We also understand that the members of the Association have a firm attitude and will not stop until the goal of overturning the proposal is achieved.</p>

<p>The H company's mail steamer, the "Audacious," carrying a large group of world travelers, arrived at the Songhu port at 3:00 AM yesterday. At 9:00 AM, two small steamers transported some of the passengers from the ship, disembarking at the New Customs Wharf. They then took cars to tour the French Concession, the International Settlement, Zhabei, and other places. They subsequently had lunch at the Astor House Hotel. In the afternoon, they took rickshaws to tour the Yuyuan Garden and other places, and went to various shops to shop. They returned to the ship by small steamer at night. The ship has a displacement of 20,000 tons, a length of 620 feet, and a width of 72 feet, and is equipped to perfection. This time, it plans to pass through 29 countries and stay briefly in 76 ports, allowing passengers to disembark and tour, completing the entire journey in 137 days. It will leave Songhu this morning at 1:00 AM and head to Korea, passing through Japan, Hawaii, California, the Panama Canal, Cuba, and reaching New York, before returning to Europe. Among the Chinese who joined the ship is Mr. Song Ziliang. Before the ship arrived in Shanghai, Mr. Song repeatedly went to the H company to inquire about the itinerary and destinations of the Lisaroad steamer. According to a confirmed message from the company yesterday, Mr. Song and his wife have changed their itinerary and have traveled from Shanghai to Japan. They are scheduled to board the ship in Kobe when it arrives, and travel to New York. The passenger seats they will occupy have already been reserved on their behalf, and the Kobe branch has been notified to check.</p>

<p>Foreign Markets Need This Product</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, which had previously prohibited the export of tea leaves colored by tea merchants for fear of affecting foreign markets, has recently found that foreign markets still need this colored tea. The Bureau specially issued a notice yesterday to lift the ban. The original text reads as follows: "It has been found that the coloring of tea leaves should be prohibited. However, since foreign markets still need it, we are temporarily allowing exports based on the situation. Before the absolute prohibition of colored tea leaves, the colorants used should be as pure as possible to ensure that they have no adverse effects on hygiene. It has been found that experts have recently invented eight kinds of yellow colorants with pure quality, which are superior to the colorants originally used for colored tea. The Shanghai Tea Industry Association has set up a factory to manufacture them and has submitted them to the Bureau for registration with the Ministry. In the future, if tea merchants in various places need to manufacture colored tea, they should use only these improved colorants. This notice is hereby issued for compliance. Bureau Chief Cai Wuji."</p>
<h3 id="e135">New Beer Classification Standards Set by the Public Works Department <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Manufacturers of white beer (i.e., Berlinne Bloode) in this city recently inquired with the Public Works Department about the type of license they should obtain. According to the Director of Health, this beverage is not classified as alcohol in the United Kingdom and should be classified as a type of non-alcoholic soda. He also suggested that beverages containing less than 3% alcohol should not require an alcohol license. According to the Director of Chemical Testing, this white beer contains 2.62% alcohol and is usually mixed with fruit juice. After discussion by the Police Preparedness Committee, it was proposed that if the beverage contains no more than 2.5% alcohol, it may not be considered alcohol, but the label on the bottle must state that it does not exceed this limit. This case was submitted to the Board of Directors and approved for implementation.</p>

<p>If Chinese Cultural Groups Are Deceived By It</p>
<p>Then Two Years of Firm Determination Will Be Wasted</p>
<p>This month, the Nagasaki International Industrial Exposition will be held in Nagasaki, Japan. It is said that the Cultural Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to use this opportunity to invite pro-Japanese elements from various countries to visit, providing food, lodging, and tours, as well as travel expenses, in order to benefit international propaganda. The personnel invited from various parts of the East will also be invited to join the Asia Movement. A group calling itself the China Iron-Blood National Salvation Group has learned of the above secret and is aware that some people in this city have been invited. Therefore, the group sent a warning letter to those who were invited yesterday. The original text reads: "To the esteemed recipient, It has come to our attention that the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, under the orders of its government, is attempting to induce Chinese cultural groups to participate in the [International Industrial Tourism Exposition] held in Nagasaki. Its intention is to use the name of international goodwill to promote the puppet state of Manchuria. If Chinese cultural groups are deceived by it, not only will the achievements of two years of firm resistance against Japan and fundamental denial of the puppet state of Manchuria be wasted, but it will also bring ridicule to the nations and greatly harm the national image. Therefore, despite the efforts of Okamiya of the Mainichi Shimbun, all have unanimously and sternly refused, refusing to be used by them. However, it has been learned that 囗囗囗 and others in Shanghai are openly contacting Okamiya, accepting their hospitality, and preparing to go to Japan. Some are even misusing the name of the China Press Eastern Travel Group to cater to the goals of the Japanese. Are there no men of courage in China? We are sending this special letter to inform you. Please restrain yourself and formally deny it in the newspaper. Do not fall into the trap of the Japanese. Otherwise, do not say that our group will punish you without warning. Sincerely, The China Iron-Blood National Salvation Group."</p>

<p>Establishing Tourism Guidance Bureau</p>
<p>Organizing Tourism Association</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province is known for its scenic spots, so during the spring and autumn holidays, people from all walks of life flock to visit. In recent years, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has spared no effort in building roads, making transportation convenient. Therefore, visitors all praise it. However, recently, a modern destruction group was discovered in Hangzhou, causing visitors to be quite wary. Yesterday, Wang Yingbin, Secretary of Construction of Zhejiang Province, came to Shanghai from Hangzhou. The reporter inquired about this matter. According to him, this kind of behavior is naive and reckless and is not allowed by law. It violates police regulations and can even violate criminal law. It is heard that such groups have also been found in the capital and have been cracked down upon. The Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Hangzhou Municipal Government are also making every effort to crack down, conducting strict investigations. At the same time, the public security personnel will do their best to protect the clothing of the people of Hangzhou and the tourists, so there is absolutely no need to worry about accidents. The reporter then inquired about the Tourism Guidance Bureau. According to the answer, it is currently being established jointly by the Zhejiang Construction Department and the Hangzhou Municipal Government. In the future, it will specialize in managing Zhejiang's scenic spots and guiding tourism. In addition, a racecourse will be established, with internal facilities such as oOLO and golf courses for suburban sports. In order to alleviate the congestion of Hangzhou, a number of acres of private land will be enclosed around the racecourse to build a new village. This project will be contracted to merchants in the future. Swimming pools, etc., are also being designed. Once the provincial government meeting approves it, it can be carried out. In addition, there will be the organization of a tourism association, with Chinese and foreign leaders as basic members, aiming to encourage travel, promote suburban games, publicize news of scenic spots in various places, and address ethical issues on roads. The Southeast Transportation Tour will be established around the end of June. At that time, the association will invite people from all walks of life to visit, inviting about 150 people. More than 30 people have already gone to various places for tourism. Shanghai Tianyi Film Company has specially sent Shao Zuiweng and Hong Shen to film activities and scenic spots in various places for the Southeast Transportation Tour. All the films are donated by Kodak. The roads have been protected by troops designated by Chairman Chiang. The Tianmu Mountain and Huangshan roads are under construction. The Shanghai China Travel Service has surveyed locations in various places to establish hotels and prepare for convenient travel. Therefore, tourists who go there in the future will find it very convenient.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Ferry Collides with and Sinks a Boat in Heavy Fog <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Thirty-Five Ferry Passengers Rescued</p>
<p>Several Still Missing Crew Members Taken Into Custody</p>
<p>At around 6:00 AM yesterday, a ferry traveling to and from the Zhoujiadu area of Pudong was traveling to the Gaochangmiao area of Nanshi when it collided with a Yitaixing Wharf ferry in the fog and sank. More than 30 people on the ferry fell into the water. Except for 30 or more people who were rescued by the police chief of the water patrol team, the rest are still being recovered. The captain of the Yitaixing ferry has been taken into custody for questioning. The details of this incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Ferry Breaks Regulations for Profit</p>
<p>There are many ferries traveling between the Huangpu River and Pudong every day. For the sake of safety on the Huangpu River, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has strictly stipulated regulations to limit the number of passengers on ferries. Generally, larger boats with a length of 80 feet are allowed to carry a maximum of 20 passengers at a time, while smaller boats are limited to 16 passengers. Overloading for profit is strictly prohibited and will be severely punished. This time, Tang Zuofa's ferry, which travels to and from Zhoujiadu in Pudong and Gaochangmiao in Nanshi, disregarded the Municipal Government's regulations for the sake of petty profit and loaded more than 30 passengers when departing from Pudong. Most of the passengers were farmers from Pudong who came to Shanghai to sell vegetables, carrying heavy baskets that filled the boat.</p>
<p>Collision Due to Heavy Fog</p>
<p>When the ferry reached the middle of the Huangpu River, it was traveling from east to west. A Yitaixing Wharf ferry, carrying more than 100 passengers from the Jianghailou customs wharf, was heading to Pudong, traveling from north to south towards the Zhonghua Wharf. It was approaching the Jiangmian River near Gaochangmiao when it encountered Tang Zuofa's ferry. At this time, there was heavy fog, and the river surface was blurred. Tang's ferry was traveling from east to west, coming out from the side. The Yitaixing ferry did not sound a horn, so neither boat was aware of the other. When the two boats were close, it was too late to avoid each other, resulting in a collision that led to disaster.</p>
<p>Ferry Sinks in the River</p>
<p>Tang Zuofa's ferry was violently struck amidships by the Yitaixing ferry. With a loud crash, the more than 30 passengers on board were greatly frightened. At that time, everyone tried to move aside, causing the weight to become unbalanced. The boat was struck by the ferry and could no longer support itself. In addition, the movement of the people in the boat made it unable to remain level, so it immediately capsized. The ferry sank at that time, and the passengers, boatmen, vegetables, and other items all fell into the river. For a time, cries for help arose on the river surface. The bow of the Yitaixing ferry was undamaged.</p>
<p>Water Police Rescue Passengers</p>
<p>After the incident, the City Public Security Bureau's water patrol team received a report and Deputy Captain Li Chengkui and Inspector Pan Xiutong led a large team of police officers on patrol boats to rush to the scene. They worked with the captains and boatmen of the Yitaixing ferry to recover the passengers and rescue those who had fallen into the water. The water police rescued 35 passengers, including Bao Gongming, Zhou Jinsheng, Xie Lanying, Cao Wushi, Yu Linying, and ferry captain Tang Zuofa and boatman Mao Hanhai, all from Pudong. Since they had all been submerged, they were drenched when rescued. After the water police took them to inquire, they were allowed to return home.</p>
<p>Punishing the Guilty Boatmen</p>
<p>However, several passengers, including Xie Youqi, were not seen after falling into the water and may have drowned. Deputy Captain Li of the water police left several police officers at the scene to wait and recover the bodies, and to investigate the names of the dead. The captain of the Yitaixing ferry, Zhang Changlin, was immediately arrested, along with Tang Zuofa, the owner of the damaged ferry, and taken to the district team for preliminary interrogation. Tang was charged with illegally carrying an excessive number of passengers, and Zhang was charged with being the main culprit of the accident. They were sent to the City Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e143">The Asian Editorial Office's Case of Extorting Ma Zhanshan Concludes <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Wang Haiqiu Testifies that Zhao Feng Organized the Asian Editorial Office</p>
<p>Tang Shichang Proves the Circumstances of Contacting at the Hotel</p>
<p>| Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 12th |</p>
<p>Wang Haiqiu, from Liaoning, who previously used the name of the Asian Editorial Office to extort General Ma Zhanshan, the famous anti-Japanese general who had retired to Tianjin, was further tried yesterday by Wang Gangxu, the criminal division chief of the Second Special District District Court, in Criminal Court One. Wang had been released on bail and arrived on time. First, the detective's lawyer presented the circumstances of the investigation during the adjournment and submitted the evidence. Then, the witness Tang Shichang was summoned. According to Tang's testimony, before this case occurred, General Ma Zhanshan received a threatening letter and immediately sent a letter to his friend Chongyuan in Shanghai. Du then entrusted it to Yu to contact the defendants. The location was arranged at the Datong Hotel. When Yu went to the hotel, Wang Haiqiu introduced him to a Mr. Liu. Liu said that he was a colleague under General Ma and had suffered with General Ma in the Northeast for a long time. Because General Ma owed his brothers eight months' pay, the brothers were destitute in Tianjin, some even pulling rickshaws for a living, and were in dire straits. They asked General Ma to find a way to solve their livelihood problems and had three reasons (which were sent to me the next day). Otherwise, they would publish a "Short Biography of General Ma Zhanshan." Yu had many conversations with Wang and others, but Wang always said that there was another person in charge. Later, because the matter could not be resolved, it was dropped. When questioned, defendant Wang Haiqiu stated that a civilian named Zhao Feng, who also used the alias Liu Xianda, came to Shanghai with him in January and rented a house at 613 Route Lafayette. The Asian Editorial Office was organized by Zhao and had nothing to do with him. Zhao has now left Shanghai and gone to another port, and he is unaware of the details. He also hired lawyer Xiang to defend him. Then, detective's lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case, stating that the defendant Wang Haiqiu had committed the crime of attempted extortion under Article 370 of the Criminal Law and requested that he be investigated according to the law. On the plaintiff's side, lawyer Chao Kun acted as an agent and stated the circumstances of the case. After arguments from both sides, the court announced the conclusion of the arguments and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 12th of this month. The defendant remained released on the original bail. The three reasons presented by the defendants are recorded below:</p>
<p>Three Reasons</p>
<p>(1) His subordinates said, "We are all subordinates of General Ma, and we have suffered with General Ma for a long time, risking our lives, until we retreated into Russian territory. We never left him. Later, General Ma was detained in Russia, and his life hung by a thread. We all went to the Russian authorities to argue forcefully, declaring that if General Ma was not restored to freedom, we would be willing to die together. The Russian authorities were greatly moved by the loyalty of his subordinates and released General Ma. General Ma looked at us face to face and said with tears in his eyes (referring to General Ma himself), 'I will live and die with you, and I swear to share my fate with you all.' When we departed from Europe to return to China, General Ma still said generously, 'This time I return to China, if I have food to eat, you all will have food to eat. I will never abandon you halfway.' General Ma expressed his determination to us in this way. Although we suffered greatly on the way, we were still grateful and tearful. We also thought that after returning to China, General Ma's whereabouts would be our guiding star. And with our past minor contributions in the anti-Japanese war in the Northeast, under General Ma's leadership, we would surely have a place to settle down and make a living. So, even though life on the way felt difficult, it was the duty of soldiers to endure hardship, and we never complained even slightly. How could we have imagined that after General Ma returned to China, he would receive special treatment from the central government, not know how to work hard and make achievements, be indecisive, and ultimately isolate himself from the central government? He became fearful and quietly went to Tianjin to make other plans. When his subordinates went to see him, he refused to meet them. Since we cannot return to the Northeast because of the anti-Japanese war, and because of General Ma's political misjudgments, we have no way to serve the central government. We suddenly feel that we have no country to turn to and no home to run to. General Ma has forgotten his oath to share life and death and has ruined the bright future of his subordinates because of his fickleness. Now, some of us have worn-out clothes and exhausted our money, wandering in various cities, while others are selling their sons and daughters to barely survive. The suffering of our situation is hard to describe in words. This is the first thing that General Ma should do for us in terms of humanity and conscience." (2) "General Ma has received millions of dollars in anti-Japanese donations from home and abroad, not to mention the money collected locally. He has never made a specific report to the public about the donations he received. Later, at the request of his subordinates, he made an announcement, vaguely stating that he had received a total of 2.7 million dollars (as evidenced by an official order). But when he reported at the YMCA in Shanghai, he suddenly said that he had only received 1.2 million dollars. In this respect alone, General Ma deceived his subordinates, deceived the public, and deceived the government. He owns a huge fortune, but he is so stingy with his subordinates. The situation is too embarrassing. This is the second thing that General Ma should do for us in terms of humanity and conscience." (3) "This time, General Ma has entrusted certain individuals to mediate, which shows that General Ma has realized that we have been following him for a long time. Publishing a short biography to express our grievances is an act of desperation. If General Ma is willing to understand the situation of his subordinates, we will naturally know when to stop and will not go to extremes. As for why we have not told his real name, it is to leave room for future meetings, to let each other get by. Unless General Ma truly does not realize the situation and truly does not understand, then we will know that General Ma has decided to pursue his own well-being and will not seek a place for his old subordinates who are wandering and displaced. At that time, we will not only have to tell his real name, but we will also have to step forward and show our faces, meet with General Ma with formal procedures, and make a clear announcement in the newspapers, appealing to social groups, party and government military departments, news agencies, and the public for a fair judgment. Therefore, it should be known that our actions are truly a matter of life and death, forced by desperation. This is the third thing that General Ma should do for us in terms of humanity."</p>
<p>A Letter</p>
<p>Also, a letter from the defendants to Ma Zhanshan is recorded below: General Xiufang, may everything be auspicious. I know quite well the matter between the General and the Asian Editorial Office. I dare not remain silent about the dangers. They have all shared hardships with the General and do not want to act too hastily, but the General treats them as strangers. This is truly impossible. People also say, "Treat me like a national scholar, and I will repay you like a national scholar; treat me like an ordinary person, and I will repay you like an ordinary person." Now the General treats people as strangers, how can he make people continue to regard him as sacred? Moreover, people are emotional creatures. If they meet with sincerity, no grievance cannot be resolved. If you treat people harshly and put them in a desperate situation, there will inevitably be a day of outburst. The resentment of poison towards people can never be forgotten by the sufferer. Then, what other option is there except to fight the General for the final victory? Now, seeing that the General has severed all ties of kindness and righteousness, they are actively carrying out the liquidation of donations, the recovery of back pay, and the early publication of a short biography, all at the same time. Under the pressure of riding a tiger, they have no choice but to ignore everything. The General's future downfall and disgrace is as clear as fire. If he still clings to his delusions, the harm will be immediately apparent. I have been with the General for a long time and must offer this final piece of advice. I have said all I can, please think it over.</p>

<p>Unable to Marry and Divorce</p>
<p>Resorting to This Desperate Measure Due to Intense Love</p>
<p>At the Central Hotel at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Hubei Road in the Public Concession, a man and a woman arrived at the hotel at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday and requested a room. The hotel clerk assigned them room number 525. They paid the room fee of two dollars on the spot. The man called himself Zhang Ankang, 30 years old, a local. The woman was named Zhou Qiming, 24 years old. After the tea server brought the tea, Zhang Ankang immediately asked for paper, ink, brush, and inkstone, closed the door, and wrote a letter. After a long time, he finished writing and then went out with the woman. They returned late at night. At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the tea server knocked on the door to ask if the room was still needed. There was no response for a long time. The tea servers thought that the two were still asleep. At 12:50 PM, they knocked again, but still no one answered. The tea servers became suspicious and took a key to open the door, but the spring lock was locked. The tea servers tried to enter through the transom and opened the door. They saw a man and a woman in the bed, both pale, with only a faint breath. Beside the pillow was a bottle of sedative pills. They knew they had taken poison and quickly informed the clerk and reported to the police, who rushed the two to Renji Hospital for treatment. After the hospital administered emergency treatment, they regained consciousness. When asked about the reason, they claimed that the man was Zhang Ankang, 32 years old, from Jiangwan, living at 391 Jiangwan Main Street. The woman was Zhou Qiming, 24 years old, from Baoshan, living outside the West Gate of Baoshan. The two had known each other for a long time, but Zhang was already married in an old-fashioned arranged marriage, and their relationship was not good. Zhang had planned to divorce his current wife and marry Zhou, but the parents of both sides were not satisfied, so it did not happen. But he could not bear to part with Zhou. With no way out, they had the idea of being tired of the world and committed suicide by poison together.</p>

<p>Yuan Genfa, from Hangzhou, Zhejiang, is 34 years old and lives in the east wing of 7 Renan Lane, Gero Road (i.e., Songshan Road) in the French Concession. He married the daughter of the famous madam Wang of the Wangji brothel (28 years old). Last year, they had a son named Debao. Yuan was arrested several years ago in connection with the robbery of 46,000 dollars from a bank and sentenced to four and a half years in prison. He was released at the end of last year.</p>

<p>After Yuan was released, he lived with his wife and mother-in-law in Renan Lane and also worked as a bookkeeper for the Ruihua Brothel in Hongyunfang, Huage Road. He was able to turn over a new leaf. Yesterday was his son Debao's first birthday. Yuan sent out invitations and hosted a large banquet for friends and guests at the Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant at 9-11 Xixinqiao Street on the second floor. The guests were all gathered together, making it quite a grand occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Borrowing Money Under False Pretenses <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>At around 9:30 PM in the evening, the guests began to leave one after another. There were still more than ten people talking on the second floor. At that time, Yuan took the wooden box containing the gift money to the first private room on the third floor to check and sort it out with his wife, Wang. As they were counting the money, a guest named Liao Amao suddenly entered and asked Yuan to borrow 30 dollars. Yuan did not agree to his request. Before he could finish his answer, shots were fired.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Shot and Fallen <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Seeing that Yuan did not agree, Liao suddenly pulled out a pistol and shot at Yuan. The first bullet hit his right chest. Seeing that the situation was not good, Yuan instinctively raised a wooden bench to resist. Liao then fired three more shots at him. Yuan was hit in the left chest by another bullet and fell to the ground. At the same time, Yuan's wife shouted for help. The murderer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, hurried downstairs and left. When the people on the second floor heard the gunshots, they did not know what had happened at first. When they heard Yuan's wife shouting for help, they rushed upstairs.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Detective Investigation <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>When the people went upstairs, they saw Yuan groaning on the ground. The restaurant's clerk quickly reported to the police by telephone. Chinese and Western detectives arrived together and first sent Yuan to Renji Hospital. Then, they thoroughly investigated the scene, first collecting all the bullet casings. The glass window of the first private room was pierced, and the bullet hit the north-facing whitewashed wall, forming a small hole. The bullet was gone. Two bullets pierced through the floorboards of the second and third floors, reaching the lower-level hall. One bullet damaged a piece of whitewashed wall, and one bullet landed on the corner of a table, forming a small hole. The power of the murderer's pistol can be imagined.</p>

<p>After the detectives finished their investigation, they immediately reported to the police chief and began to investigate. According to those close to Genfa, the murderer and Yuan were good friends and were one of the invited guests. He also gave four dollars as a gift when he came. It is said that Yuan and Liao had a quarrel over a woman's issue, and the motive for the murder may have been laid in advance. However, after Yuan was sent to the hospital, the doctor found that both bullets had hit vital parts. He needed to have an operation to remove the bullets immediately, and there was little hope of survival.</p>

<p>A Fixed Amount of 300,000 Yuan is Determined to be Jointly Operated by Government and Business</p>
<p>Business Shares Have Been Secured, Government Shares Are Still Being Raised</p>
<p>The Municipal Government believes that Pudong lacks water supply equipment and the residents' needs are urgent, so it has decided to raise funds to create a water supply company. According to responsible personnel of the Public Utilities Bureau, the company will be jointly operated by the government and business, with a capital of 300,000 yuan, which will be raised separately by the two parties. All plans have been generally drafted. The only difficulty is the economic problem. At present, through the efforts of local gentry in Pudong and business leaders in the city, business shares have been largely secured. For government shares, the Municipal Government plans to borrow from the banking community due to revenue shortfalls. The outcome is still unpredictable. In short, this undertaking is urgently needed, and the authorities are determined to plan it carefully, hoping to complete it in a short period of time. The preparatory personnel are Xu Peihuang of the Public Utilities Bureau and Cai Zengji of the Finance Bureau on the official side, and Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Yao Mulian, etc. on the business side.</p>

<p>Supplementing the Contract Terms for Another Year</p>
<p>The business of selling newspapers on the Beijing-Shanghai line passenger cars was previously contracted by the Shanghai Newspaper Association. The contract expired on February 28 of this year. The association requested to continue the business for another year from March 1 of this year and requested to add a clause to the contract stipulating that if a special accident occurs on the line during the contract period, causing the entire line or a section of passenger cars to stop running, the carrier's vehicle rental fee will be reduced on a daily basis according to the number of stopped cars and mileage. The Vehicle Affairs Office also made a similar request when the association previously renewed the contract for selling newspapers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line. After several negotiations, referring to the general idea of Article 21 in the contract signed between the two lines and the Dafeng Transit Silver Company for transporting silver, it was revised to state that if war or other circumstances occur during the contract period that obstruct the operation of the entire line of passenger cars, this contract may be suspended until the passenger cars resume operation. The number of days of this suspension may be made up in full after the contract expires. However, this does not apply if only a section of passenger cars on the entire line is stopped for less than three days. If the stoppage exceeds three days, the Railway Bureau may consider the situation and supplement the number of days after the contract expires according to the above method. It is now planned to handle this matter in accordance with the precedent of adding a clause to the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line. The Bureau has approved the implementation, it is said.</p>

One robber pulled out a pistol from his sleeve, aimed it at his chest, and said, "Help a little." The other robber grabbed his box cannon, containing seven bullets, and a police whistle, and fled towards Fangxie Road. The police officer had to return to the Second District Headquarters and report the situation to District Chief Police Li. District Chief Li immediately dispatched patrol officers to search in all directions, but the robbers had already gone far and could not be apprehended. Afterwards, District Chief Police Li reported the situation to Bureau Chief Wen Hongen of the Public Security Bureau for review.</p>

<p>Tao Jiaoyao, the former director of the Beijing Water Conservancy Bureau, the director of the Jiujiang Commercial Port in Jiangxi who did not take office, and a native of Nanchang, Jiangxi, was recently sued by Gao Xiaochen, represented by lawyer Liu Cailiang, in the Second Special District Court on a criminal self-complaint for fraud. According to the complaint, the court summoned him for trial on the 24th of last month. Because the lawyer Luo Jiaheng hired by the defendant raised questions about the signature on the power of attorney of the self-complaint and the handwriting in the self-complaint's previous letter to the defendant, the lawyers on both sides argued fiercely. The court ordered a handwriting examination and rescheduled the hearing for April 6, instructing the self-complainant to appear in court for further questioning, which has been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday was the date for the continued hearing. Judge Tu Shenjie tried the case in the Fifth Court. The self-complainant was still represented by a lawyer, and the defendant arrived with his defense lawyer. According to the self-complainant's lawyer, the self-complainant Gao Xiaochen is currently in Fujian and cannot make it in time. He has sent a telegram to our lawyer, requesting a ten-day extension to appear in court for questioning. The defendant's side did not object to the rescheduling. Judge Tu instructed that the defendant had filed a counterclaim and that the trial could only proceed after the self-complainant appeared in court. Therefore, it was ruled that the hearing be rescheduled for the 17th of this month, pending the self-complainant's appearance in court for further questioning. The court was then adjourned.</p>

Yesterday morning, the police presented Li Chunsheng, Xia Shaoqiu, Gu Rufang, Wang Ruiting, and the convicted prisoner Kong Guangfu, and others, to Criminal Court Three. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, stated that the detective in March 1928 (i.e., around 6:00 AM on the 5th day of the second month of the lunar calendar) shot and killed Bao Tongshi, the female head of the Yangzhou textile factory, on Gordon Road. During the rescheduling, the defendants were taken to the scene of the incident to demonstrate how they carried out the crime and admitted it to the police station. It was found that the pistol was taken from Wang Ruiting and given to the two defendants, Li and Xia, to shoot. Confessions of each defendant have been recorded and are hereby submitted for inspection. Then, Bao Yichuan, a native of Yangzhou, testified that Tongshi was his wife and worked as a female head in the roving room of the Tongxing Textile Factory. At that time, she was going out of the factory when she suddenly heard three gunshots. She was first hit in the hand, and the last bullet entered from the back and exited from below the front breast, killing her. His wife had no enemies, and it was heard that she was instigated by the leader of the labor union. The Guo offender has already been sentenced to life imprisonment, etc. However, lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the two offenders, Guo and Shi, were arrested by the Putuo Road Police Station and sentenced to life imprisonment on November 15, 1929. However, the two offenders did not accuse the defendants of conspiracy when they were identified by the police, so they were not brought into the case. When questioned, the five defendants, Li Chunsheng and others, completely overturned their previous confessions at the police station, making excuses for each other, all claiming that they had nothing to do with it, and asked for judgment. Judge Xiao Fen ordered them to be remanded and rescheduled for further verification.</p>

<p>Recent Situation of Sanyu Chicken Farm The tragic reality of rural bankruptcy in China has become increasingly severe in recent years. Efforts by people in and out of the government to rescue the situation have often been criticized for being unrealistic and lacking practical force. Zhang Xiaokuan, a graduate of agricultural studies, has always advocated developing rural sideline industries to revive rural areas. He believes that chicken farming is the most common sideline in Chinese villages and should be improved and developed. Therefore, after the end of the January 28th Shanghai Incident, he established Sanyu Chicken Farm in Maqiao Town in the county. He planned meticulously and managed painstakingly. Although the scale is still relatively rudimentary, the organization is orderly. The farm specializes in raising the world-renowned [Leghorn] egg-laying chickens. The management adopts the latest scientific methods. All eggs sold are carefully selected, white, round, fresh, and reliable. Each egg weighs between 1.7 and 2.4 taels, and its nutritional value is self-evident. The farm also sells fertilized eggs, which are produced by mating strong, excellent, unrelated parent chickens. Experimental results show that the fertilization rate reaches over 85%, the hatching rate reaches over 95%, and the survival rate reaches over 94% (referring to chicks within four weeks). The fully grown chickens are all very large and excellent. It is said that visitors from all walks of life have expressed satisfaction and are happy to purchase them. Currently, the farm is sparing no effort to improve its equipment and management to achieve perfection, in order to live up to the expectations of the community.</p>

<p>Sanlun Brand Goods Sell Briskly The Sanlun brand of woolen and cotton knitted swimsuits, pure silk stockings, and mercerized cotton socks produced by Lianhua Woolen Mill in Hele Lane, North Henan Road, have been around for ten years. Over the years, they have been continuously improved. The styles are in line with the times, and the materials are superior. They are no less than foreign goods. Therefore, the factory has recently received a large number of orders from domestic and Southeast Asian customers, and the supply is struggling to meet the demand. This is a good phenomenon for the domestic goods industry. The factory, in view of the fact that the imperialists in the Dutch East Indies (Java) have drastically increased import taxes, has decided to make special sacrifices this year to reclaim the benefits and glory for the domestic goods industry.</p>

<p>Kalachakra Tantra</p>
<p>Respectfully informing benevolent individuals who are devoted to recommending the deceased and prolonging life</p>
<p>This time, we respectfully invite the Panchen Lama to West Lake to practice the Kalachakra Tantra Dharma Assembly in order to eliminate disasters in our country and pray for world peace. We will take this opportunity to also ask the Panchen Lama to practice two kinds of Dharma incidentally, one is the Dharma of Recommending the Deceased, in order to recommend our ancestors and all lonely souls, so that they may be reborn in the Pure Land early, and the other is the Dharma of Prolonging Life, in order to eliminate the disasters of our living parents and ourselves, so that life can be extended. These two Dharma are very important, and we must practice them once a year. However, the previous practices did not have much merit, because although the Dharma is the same, the people who practice the Dharma are different, and the merit is also different. The Panchen Lama is the Dharma King of Tibet and also the National Teacher of China. Tibetans call him the incarnation of Amitabha Buddha. This time, he recites sutras, chants mantras, and orients for us, because his foundation, learning, and cultivation are all very great, so the merit of practicing the Dharma is naturally very great, which is thousands of times higher than our usual practice of asking people to practice Dharma. This opportunity is truly rare and also because we have this karma. Gentlemen and believers, if you want to recommend your ancestors or prolong the life of your parents and yourself, please see the announcement of this association and contact the offices in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou. Send a letter to the post office to request a volunteer form, state your name, age, and origin, and pay the Dharma fee, and we will set up a seat for recommendation and extension. The purpose of this association is to universally save sentient beings, so we announce this merit of recommending the deceased and prolonging life to the ten directions, hoping that everyone will initiate their minds at the same time, so that this merit can be fully perfect. Office addresses: 21 Xiangpu Camp, Nanjing, Public Recreation Association, Renji Hall, Yunnan Road, Shanghai, 3 Putisi Road, Xinshichang, Hangzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Reading Q&amp;A <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Reading Guidance on Marriage Issues Expressed in "Little Ten Years"</p>
<p>From reading the book, I have a question that I would like to ask. Although it is not about the book itself, this question arose from reading the book, so I am bringing it up. I am a person who has suffered from this question for a long time, and I think there must be many young people who have the same problem as me, so I hope you can give a detailed answer.</p>
<p>The reason is this: In the second volume of Mr. Ye Yongzhen's "Little Ten Years," he wrote about how he bravely sacrificed his old-fashioned wife. At that time, his mentality was very intense. He would rather leave his family, his beloved mother, and his wife with whom he had shared a bed for several days, and finally left to meet his lover.</p>
<p>This touched me greatly, but what confuses me most is that someone wrote a comment in the book (this book is from the library): "Bah! You are brave enough to break this dark, buying-and-selling marriage, but what about the other party, your wife with whom you have already shared a bed?" Behind this sentence, another person spoke out for the wronged: "Bullshit! You compromiser! Should he abandon his own happiness to succumb to the darkness? A centrist!" The theoretical struggle between these two gentlemen really confused me, because I am also in an environment like Mr. Ye, but I finally became a centrist.</p>
<p>Because I usually care a lot about this marriage issue, I have collected the opinions of the above two parties and explained them as follows: But I don't know which one is right?</p>
<p>The brave ones believe that new young people should never tolerate fighting with the environment, especially in marriage. The old-fashioned, buying-and-selling marriage is unacceptable. An unfamiliar wife with no love should never live with her. Regardless of stubborn parents or a feudal society, they should never compromise.</p>
<p>The centrists, on the other hand, believe that today's society has not yet advanced to another new stage. Those who are born in this unfortunate stage of transition, although they should promote society to move towards a new stage, can still be patient in marriage. The reason is that in this capitalist society, everything is commodified, even women. Therefore, most people who marry for love will end up losing love and divorcing, especially in this city where money and desires flow rampant. Which modern woman will have sincere love? It is better to compromise and marry a woman from the countryside, and maybe you can live a very sweet married life. There are many young people with this mentality. When I was in junior high school, two-thirds of the students in my grade were married, completely in the old style. Some were very good, and some were bad. I am one of them.</p>
<p>Sir, these two completely different arguments are very confusing to me, and maybe to many other young people too!</p>
<p>Marriage is a lifelong event. Although I have already made a mistake, I hope to get a correct answer so that future young people will not follow in my footsteps. (Letter from Liu Yingyun, Jinan)</p>

<p>Hoping the Round Table Conference Has a Satisfactory Resolution</p>
<p>Important Announcement Regarding the Far Eastern Games</p>
<p>(Guomin News Agency, Manila, 6th) Today, the Propaganda Department of the Far Eastern Games issued an important announcement, stating regarding the puppet Manchukuo's participation in next month's大会事, that the Philippines, as the host, had requested that puppet Manchukuo be allowed to participate on a trial basis. Now that China has rejected the puppet state as a member, the athletes from the puppet state will be absolutely prohibited from participating in all competitions. Finally, it stated that if it were not for China's opposition, there would be no other reason to reject the puppet state's participation in sports. We hope that the Round Table Conference in Shanghai can have a satisfactory resolution to this issue, so as to promote sports in the Far East. The department also stated that, according to the rules of the Far Eastern Games, the Philippines is not in a position to make a judgment, and the final decision on all issues still depends on the opinion of the Chinese Association.</p>

<p>Cao Yunxiang to Attend the Meeting in Place of Wang Zhengting</p>
<p>Sports Association Cables Reply to Philippine Overseas Chinese, Attitude is Resolute</p>
<p>Representatives of the Island to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Round Table Conference of China, the Philippines, and Japan, which is about to be held on the 9th, has now been officially confirmed. Yesterday, an official from the Chinese Sports Association told reporters that Dr. Wang Zhengting has cabled Shanghai, stating that he is busy with affairs in Ping and cannot spare the time to travel south. Our side has three representatives, Wang Zhengting, Hao Gengsheng, and Shen Siliang. Now that Wang is unable to attend, it has been decided that Cao Yunxiang, the former president of Tsinghua University, will attend in Wang's place, and his agreement has been obtained. The meeting place was originally planned to be at the Palace Hotel, but it must be decided after consultation among the representatives of the three countries. Japanese representatives Yamamoto and Matsuzawa have arrived in Shanghai, but they have not yet met with our association. The Philippine representatives will arrive on the 8th. Our association has repeatedly expressed the content of the meeting, adhering to the principle of not discussing with puppets and not associating with puppets. Overseas Chinese have also sent cables of warning, their enthusiasm is commendable. The Japanese are cunning and treacherous, trying to cover up the eyes and ears of the world with one hand, forcing us to indirectly acknowledge them. It is impossible to endure humiliation and seek perfection. If they insist on bringing it up, or if the Philippine side is deceived by them and allows the puppet Manchukuo to participate in an individual capacity, then our side is determined to withdraw. According to Mr. Matsuzawa, the Japanese representative, his arrival in Shanghai is purely to assist Yamamoto in attending the Round Table Conference. How to deal with the situation if China does not allow the puppet state to participate will depend on Dr. Yamamoto's decision. However, according to reporters' inquiries, the Japanese attitude is very strong, and they have the momentum of achieving their goals. If our side is determined not to lose its rights and humiliate the country, then the future of this Far Eastern Games seems bleak.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Island to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>Rumor that Puppet Representatives are Active in Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding the Round Table Conference of China, Japan, and the Philippines, the Japanese side has reportedly scheduled it to be held in Shanghai on the 9th of this month (Monday). This matter is of great importance. This reporter recently visited Mr. Shen Siliang to inquire about everything. According to him, the Round Table Conference of the three countries has indeed been scheduled to be held in Shanghai on the 9th. In addition to Japanese representative Yamamoto, who has already arrived in Shanghai, the Philippine representatives are also en route and will arrive on the 8th (Sunday). Our representatives were originally scheduled to be Wang Zhengting, Hao Gengsheng, and Shen Siliang. I (Shen, self-proclaimed) sent a telegram to Beiping the day before yesterday urging Mr. Wang Zhengting to come to Shanghai to attend, but I have now received a reply from Wang stating that he is busy with affairs in Ping and has no time to travel to Shanghai. It has now been decided to replace him with Cao Yunxiang, President of Tsinghua University, and Cao's consent has been obtained. As for the meeting location, although it was previously said that it would be held at the Palace Hotel, all issues must wait until the Philippine representatives arrive in Shanghai and be determined after consultation among the three parties. This reporter then inquired about the rumor that a puppet representative, Mr. Zheng, is currently active in Shanghai. When asked whether this was true, he replied that he was not aware of the details, but the matter may have been caused by something.</p>

<p>Firmly Reject the Participation of the Puppet Manchukuo</p>
<p>The matter of the puppet Manchukuo requesting to participate in the Far Eastern Games has already become an impossible fact after being formally rejected by our country's sports authorities. However, some country's people have many treacherous schemes and fabricate propaganda in all directions, causing overseas and domestic compatriots to be confused by it. The National Physical Education Advancement Association has repeatedly received telegrams from home and abroad, requesting opposition. The association has replied to each one, expressing its attitude and comforting overseas compatriots. News has been reported in various newspapers. Yesterday, the Advancement Association received another telegram from the Iloilo Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, and the text of the reply telegram is excerpted as follows: The Iloilo Chinese Chamber of Commerce telegram says, [To the Chinese National Physical Education Advancement Association: The puppet Manchukuo is forcing its participation in the Far Eastern Games, which has enraged all overseas Chinese. Please thoroughly oppose it.] The National Physical Education Advancement Association replied, [To the Iloilo Chinese Chamber of Commerce: This association firmly rejects the puppet Manchukuo's participation in the Far Eastern Games. The Shanghai meeting is a regular meeting of the Far Eastern Games and will definitely not discuss this issue.]</p>
<p>Letter to the Authorities from Two Track and Field Teams</p>
<p>Willing to be a Backing, Do Not Harm the National Prestige</p>
<p>To Mr. Wang Zhengting, Mr. Hao Gengsheng, Mr. Shen Siliang, and the sports authorities: Japan is妄thinking of using sports to aid its political aggression, instigating the puppet state to participate in the Far Eastern Games, hoping to create an equal position between the puppet state and us, so that our country tacitly acknowledges the puppet state, which is a hint, and can confuse the world's perceptions. This is what is called "Sima Zhao's heart is known to everyone on the road." Recently, the Japanese have used all kinds of cunning tricks, one after another, and sports envoys have been traveling continuously. They falsely claim that there is a call for a round table conference, and falsely claim that a round table conference has been realized. At the same time, a senior official of the Ministry of Education suddenly made a statement allowing individual performances by the puppet state, although Mr. Shen Siliang subsequently expressed that the issue of the puppet state's participation would not be discussed. However, the public is panicked, and they are telling each other in alarm, running around to report, and they cannot completely dispel the doubts of the Chinese people. What is the round table conference discussing? What is the scope? Are there representatives from the puppet state participating? Why are the venue and date of the meeting kept strictly secret? Is there anything unmentionable hidden in it? These are all things that the whole country is watching closely and waiting for the sports authorities to explain clearly. The Japanese say, "Politics and sports are two completely separate things. Do not harm sports with politics." Their words are certainly enough to decorate, but we are fortunate not to fall into their trap. Politics restricts sports, and the impact is small. Sports restricts politics, and the impact is great. We would rather sports be sacrificed because of politics than politics be sacrificed because of sports. Understand this, and our country should put attending the Far Eastern Games out of its mind and not be softened by political pressure. If not, or if the puppet state is allowed to participate formally or substantially, it would be tantamount to tacitly acknowledging the establishment of the puppet state in disguise. One word can ruin a country, and the crime is unforgivable. Is the sports cause that the whole country enthusiastically promotes and supports for this purpose? In short, at the Far Eastern Games, there is the puppet state without us, and there is us without the puppet state. This is a matter of course and should not be hesitated. If there is any hesitation, it will inevitably lead to eternal regret. Fortunately, you gentlemen firmly advocate宁sacrificing sports rather than sacrificing the country. The members of the two teams pledge to be a backing. We wish you good health. The Beijing China Track and Field Team and the Shanghai Baihong Track and Field Team, April 6th.</p>

<p>Held Today at Nankai Middle School</p>
<p>The North China pre-selection representative team for the Far Eastern basketball team was selected last week with 12 players from Ji and Ping. The commitment letter has also been filled out and submitted to the association, and the North China Sports Federation has decided to practice for one week from the 2nd to the 7th and depart for Shanghai on the 9th to participate in the selection. Coach Dong Shouyi arrived in Tianjin on the morning of the 2nd with five candidates from Ping City. They have been practicing at the YMCA and the Industrial College courts, and Mr. Dong has been guiding them at all times, teaching them strategies. The situation is very tense. Tang Baokun was elected captain, and Yin Hongxiang served as secretary. (Tianjin Electric) Ping and Jin representatives for the North China track and field pre-selection of the Far Eastern Games arrived in Tianjin today. Chief referee Zhang Boling, track referee Ma Yuehan, and field referee Dong Shouyi.</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) This time, the province did not participate in the Far Eastern pre-selection due to a lack of talent and little hope. Now, Liu Mengling, a student from Jinan Private Qilu University, has petitioned the Education Department, willing to go to Tianjin at his own expense to participate in the pre-selection and register for the 400 meters (currently, his 400-meter result is 53.8 seconds). He Siyuan, the director of the Education Department, appreciated Liu's ambition and allowed him to telegraph Tianjin, ordering Shang Linmei, the director of the Shandong Provincial Sports Field, to register him nearby and also send Shang as the leader and instructor. Liu departed on the evening of the 4th. The text of the telegram from the Education Department to Zhao Wenzao, the sports supervisor of the Hebei Education Department, is as follows: Hebei Education Department, Committee Member Zhao (Wenzao), and forward to Shang Xunshan: Liu Mengling, a student from Qilu University, is willing to represent Shandong in the Far Eastern pre-selection at his own expense. The event is 400 meters. Ding Jiang will go north tonight. If Xunshan is in Tianjin, please Committee Member Zhao register his name on the list, and send Xunshan as the leader and instructor.

<p>Caused by Extreme Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Sato's Funeral to be Held by the Tennis Association</p>
<p>Fukuda Added to the European Team, Miki Appointed Captain</p>
<p>(Japanese United News Agency, Tokyo Fast Electric, 6th) According to a telegram received by the Japanese Tennis Association, Sato Jiro, a Japanese Davis Cup tennis player who is currently on his way to Europe, committed suicide by jumping into the sea from the Hakone Maru in the Strait of Malaga on the evening of the 5th. (Note) Sato graduated from Waseda University and won the national singles championship in 1930. In 1931, he participated in the Davis Cup tennis war. This year, he was again appointed as a Davis Cup player representing Japan. He is 25 years old. His backhand is excellent, and although his serve is weak, he is one of the top ten players in the world.</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo Fast Electric, 6th) Sato Jiro, the main player of the Japanese Davis Cup team, stopped disembarking for recuperation and departed for Singapore on the afternoon of the 5th. However, not long after the departure, on the evening of the 5th, he committed suicide by jumping into the sea from the Hakone Maru. The cause was extreme neurasthenia.</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo Electric, 6th) According to a telegram from the Tennis Association, Davis Cup player Sato Jiro was missing shortly after the Hakone Maru sailed from Singapore to Europe at 3 PM yesterday. After searching, a suicide note was found in his private room, and it was learned that he had committed suicide by jumping into the sea. When Sato was decided to be the Davis Cup player in January of this year, he suffered from neurasthenia. At that time, it was thought that it was not suitable for him to travel far across the ocean, but when he departed, he had fully recovered. The parties concerned deeply hoped that there would be no problem, but because life on the ship was monotonous, or perhaps because of this, the old illness recurred. When the Hakone Maru arrived in Singapore, the shipowner telegraphed the Tokyo Tennis Association to report, [Player Sato wants to go ashore, how should we handle it?]. The reply was [Go to Marseille]. Sato also had no intention of landing. There was a continuing telegram report, thinking that he felt the responsibility of being the main player, which aggravated his illness. Sato was from Gunma Prefecture and is currently a third-year student in the Department of Political Economy at Waseda University. Since he first attended the Davis Cup tennis war in the sixth year of Showa, he has often attended the international tennis world. In the past two years, he has fought to the semi-finals in Europe. The Tennis Association held an emergency board meeting at 1 PM today, deciding to send a staff member to Singapore and deciding that Sato's funeral would be held by the Tennis Association.</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo Electric, 6th) Regarding the aftermath of Sato's incident, the Tennis Association decided to send Fukuda Masanosuke to Singapore on the Fushimi Maru, which sets sail from Yokohama on the 15th. It also decided to urge Miki Ryuki to rise again and replace Sato as the main player.</p>

<p>1.  The Motivation for Returning the Indemnity</p>
<p>In October of the 14th year of the Republic of China, the Dutch government, in order to enhance the friendship between China and the Netherlands, sent a Dutch envoy to present a memorandum to the Beijing government, expressing its willingness to return the remaining amount of the Dutch portion of the Gengzi Indemnity, to be used exclusively for undertakings beneficial to China. They also felt that the Yellow River flood was a serious disaster and intended to use the Dutch Gengzi Indemnity to manage the Yellow River and extend the use of Dutch hydraulic engineers to jointly plan to eliminate the immeasurable harm suffered by the people in Chinese history. The Beijing government immediately expressed its gratitude, but this case was never decided due to frequent political changes.</p>
<p>2.  The Mature Period for Returning the Indemnity</p>
<p>It was not until April of the 22nd year of the Republic of China that our government exchanged documents with the Dutch Minister to China, deciding to return the full amount of the Gengzi Indemnity owed to the Netherlands from January 1, 1926 (the 15th year of the Republic of China) to our country, designated for use in Chinese water conservancy projects and to subsidize cultural institutions.</p>
<p>3.  The Sino-Dutch Exchange of Documents and Coordination</p>
<p>Regarding the use of the Dutch Gengzi Indemnity, the exchange of documents stipulates very clearly, the most obvious of which are: (1) 65 percent of the returned funds should be used for Chinese water conservancy projects, and the remaining 35 percent should be used for cultural undertakings.</p>
<p>4.  The Total Amount of the Returned Indemnity</p>
<p>It is estimated that the Dutch gold is 3,066,055 florins and 289.</p>
<p>5.  The Amount Allocated for Educational and Cultural Undertakings</p>
<p>Regarding the 35 percent used for cultural purposes, 400,000 shields should be allocated from the funds that have been accumulated since January 1, 1926 (that is, the 15th year of the Republic of China) and are currently in the custody of the Dutch government as a cultural fund. This fund should be handed over to the board of directors organized by the Chinese diplomatic representative stationed in The Hague and the president of the Faculty of Arts of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Amsterdam and the president of the University of Leiden for safekeeping and handling. In order to enhance Sino-Dutch cultural relations, 53 percent of the annual interest earned by the cultural fund should be handed over to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences will use 53.33 percent of its annual interest as a subsidy for the academy's undertakings, and 43 percent as expenses for sending Chinese scholars and students to study in the Netherlands, but the ratio can also be changed if necessary. The remaining 47 percent of the annual interest earned by the cultural fund will be donated to the Chinese Studies Institute of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands every year.</p>
<p>6.  The Organization of the Dutch Gengzi Indemnity Board of Directors</p>
<p>The Dutch Gengzi Indemnity Board of Directors is named the Sino-Dutch Gengzi Indemnity Water Conservancy Undertakings Board of Directors. The organization of this association is extremely simple and is only composed of two Chinese directors and one Dutch director appointed by the Chinese National Government, and one of them is designated as the chairman of the board, under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>7.  Current Board Member Candidates</p>
<p>The Chinese side is Shi Ying and Sun Fushi, and the Dutch side is He Longmen. Shi Ying is also the chairman of the board.</p>
<p>8.  Recent Status of the Dutch Gengzi Indemnity Distribution</p>
<p>Because the Dutch Gengzi Indemnity has not been returned for long, it has not yet been distributed. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e204">Municipal Party Headquarters Sends Letter to Literary and Art Circles: National Revival as the Central Ideology <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters believes that with the current national crisis becoming increasingly urgent, promoting national revival is an urgent priority. As this city is the cultural center of the country, there are many literary and art writers who promote nationalism, but there are also concerns about ideological biases and conceptual errors. To correct this, the headquarters sent a letter to all literary and art societies, writers, and publishing circles yesterday, defining "national revival" as the central ideology of literature and art. The original letter is recorded below: [Respectfully, in recent years, foreign tribes have invaded and national difficulties have become increasingly urgent. Saving the country and preserving existence is the common responsibility of the people today. Looking around China, the people are lazy and the national spirit is declining to the extreme. In addition, literary and art writers, in their works, either pursue the relationship between men and women or hate the class divisions, or vent their anger and dissatisfaction, or indulge in lustful desires. The cause and effect circulate, serving as each other's complement, so that the national spirit gradually becomes passive, world-weary, romantic, hedonistic, decadent, and dispersed. The power of self-confidence is lost, and the unity of the group is not strong. How can we hope to exert national power to resist foreign aggression and secure internal stability? The rise and fall of the country and the elimination of abuses depend on the joint efforts of the literary and art circles. In view of this, this headquarters has determined that "national revival" is the central ideology of all literary and art this year. Your publication has the responsibility of guiding young people and saving the country. Please express your grand theories according to this purpose to improve the social customs. The country and the nation rely on it. Sincerely,]</p>

This meeting is still held in Shanghai. The purpose of holding the annual meeting is to focus on the presentation and dissemination of papers, so that the members can take this opportunity to publicly report on their research.</p>

<p>— Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>At that time, the person who protected her on the road was Ronglu. Before Cixi became a concubine to Xianfeng, Ronglu was her lover. Later, Ronglu still did his best to be her loyal servant. Their love affair was thus sacrificed painfully.</p>
<p>Now, almost half a century has passed, and she herself has been revered as the Empress Dowager. Ronglu is dead, and her beloved son, Tongzhi, is also long gone. All that remains is the most cunning Li Lianying, still accompanying her, from this same road, back to her birthplace - Rehe.</p>
<p>Leaving the Forbidden City—that place full of ambition—further and further away, the Empress Dowager's large entourage keeps moving forward on this yellow sandy road. But the traces of the entourage fifty years ago have become like fleeting clouds, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>Forward, forward, crossing those green hills, occasionally resting for a while in several pre-arranged temples: : : then continuing forward. This beautiful procession finally set up camp on the large open space in front of the Rehe Imperial Palace. Everything here is as still as death!</p>
<p>Although the roofs of these palaces are also covered with yellow tiles, and the beams and pillars are painted with kylins, dragons, and phoenixes, these works seem not as exquisite as the palaces in the Forbidden City of Beijing or the Summer Palace: presumably the skills of the local craftsmen here are indeed not as good as those of the craftsmen in Beijing.</p>
<p>Groups of female officials, eunuchs, and palace maids followed silently behind the Empress Dowager, walking very quickly. The Empress Dowager's walk was originally very brisk, but at this time, she seemed eager to recall the past, so she walked back and forth through these deserted palaces even faster. She walked through almost all the places she had visited when she was a young imperial concubine. (5)</p>

<p>[Sing a song! Sir.] This is the third request.</p>
<p>In the room, L, P, and C were sitting around the table, and I was reclining on the sofa. We were happily talking about our sea voyage in the past few days.</p>
<p>The door was completely pushed open, and she walked in, her hand on the table. Our conversation had to stop. I cast my gaze over.</p>
<p>Standing in front of us was a young woman, shyly lowering her head. Under her soft black hair was a delicate face.</p>
<p>She raised her head slightly and said again: [Sing a song! Can it be "Taohua River," Sir?]</p>
<p>Her voice trembled slightly, and I couldn't help but take another look at her. Behind her moist eyelashes, a pair of lively eyes was so melancholy.</p>
<p>None of us spoke, just shook our heads.</p>
<p>Quietly, she retreated like a shadow, and a sigh came from her mouth. Her trailing gown disappeared at the door, and the door closed immediately. In the room, there was still a deathly silence, and sadness covered my heart.</p>
<p>[Sing a song! Sir.] Forever, this voice floats in my ears.</p>

<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>There were rumors some time ago that elevated trams would appear in Shanghai, and the routes for the first and second circular lines were also set. The general public in Shanghai looked forward to it very much, chanting Amitabha Buddha and Jesus Amen every day, praying for its realization. The reason is that sitting on an elevated tram, although not comparable to the upper class sitting on airplanes who can come and go in the clouds, is still a cut above those lower class people who walk on the ground.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this grand plan only remained a high-sounding slogan and did not actually elevate the trams into the clouds, which naturally greatly disappointed people.</p>
<p>However, in the recent past, Shanghai has had double-decker buses parading through the city. Sitting upstairs, you can look down on all the people walking on the street with broken legs, which is very satisfying.</p>
<p>Everything has a tendency to develop upward in this day and age. You see, in previous years, three-story Western-style buildings were already somewhat unable to reach the sky or the ground, but in recent years, building skyscrapers has become commonplace. Eighteen stories are nothing rare; buildings are being built with twenty stories, twenty-four stories. Therefore, the evolution of buses from one story to two stories is just the beginning of evolution.</p>
<p>In the future, I dare to guarantee that all vehicles will have at least ten or eight stories, with elevators to transport passengers up and down. Because the buildings on both sides are already more than twenty stories high, if the vehicles are not raised to ten or eight stories, then not to mention that passengers will not see the light of day, but in terms of air circulation, I am afraid that it cannot be how reasonable it is.</p>

<p>Chapter 27. Min Grievances Silently Dissipated, Compassionate Hearts Could Be Felt, Idle Sorrow Arose After Getting Drunk, Old Things Difficult to Forget</p>
<p>This was really a big mistake of her own. Since she knew that her husband could not stay in Beijing forever, why did she force her husband back from afar and hastily complete the marriage? This was nothing else, simply adding shackles to herself. The more she thought about it this way, the narrower her heart became. Naturally, after thinking for a long time, she inevitably speculated in the opposite direction. If she had not been engaged to Zhao Ziqiang, she would not have had to force Zhao Ziqiang back from afar to complete the marriage, and she would still be a free person today, without having to worry about the future. Naturally, the only boyfriend she knew was Gan Jizhi. Gan Jizhi already had a job, lived independently, and was not restricted by his brother and sister-in-law. Her relationship with him might not be below that of Manying and her cousin. Although life would be a little harder at this young age, it would be worth it to be a couple. When Guizhi thought of this, the degree of regret naturally deepened. She tossed and turned in bed all night and didn't fall asleep. When she got up the next morning, she felt that her eyes were a little dry, not as comfortable as usual. So, she took a small mirror and looked at it. Oh my! Her eyes were swollen like two peaches. In the early morning, she felt very sad, and the tears in her eyes were flowing out hotly, and she didn't know how long it had been. At that time, she didn't pay attention to it, feeling sad for a while, and thinking wildly for a while, bringing her eyes to this state. This was impossible to imagine. She held the mirror in her hand and doubted the extent of her sadness. So, she put down the mirror and quickly ran to the bed to check the pillow in her arms. Oh! The two wet marks were almost bigger than the mouth of a bowl. There was so much tear water! She sat on the edge of the bed with the pillow in her arms, unable to speak for a long time. (356)</p>

<p>Yesterday, I took a tram to Juan's house. When the tram arrived at the XX Road station, a fashionable young lady and a frail, white-haired old woman got on. At this time, it happened to be crowded, so I stood up, preparing to give my seat to the old woman.</p>
<p>But the reality was not like this; when I stood up, the fashionable young lady had a triumphant look on her face and sat down in a grand manner.</p>
<p>Of course, I was very unwilling to and said to her: [Sorry, I was giving the seat to the old woman.]</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, it would have been better if I hadn't said this. Once these words were said, the fashionable young lady's almond-shaped eyes widened, her eyebrows arched, and her face turned red as she娇声娇气 said: [She is my family's old nanny!]</p>
<p>[But I like to give the seat to the old nanny!]</p>
<p>The fashionable young lady didn't say anything or give way, and her powdered face was full of anger.</p>
<p>Is the old nanny not a person? Is the old nanny not worthy of sitting?</p>
<p>I looked back at the old nanny, and the old nanny smiled bitterly to herself.</p>

<p>When King Louis XIV of France was in power, a thief once broke into the Palace of Versailles. When the thief was taking down an expensive wall clock, the king suddenly walked in. The thief didn't seem to recognize the king, so he wasn't flustered. He calmly said to the king:</p>
<p>[Hey, friend, please hold my ladder, I'm afraid it will slip and fall to the ground.]</p>
<p>The king smiled and held his ladder, thinking that he was a watchmaker who was going to take the wall clock to be repaired.</p>
<p>The next day, the theft was discovered. They reported it to the king. The king was very surprised and then laughed and said:</p>
<p>[You don't need to talk about it, because... I am also the thief's helper!]</p>

<p>General Situation of She Inkstones</p>
<p>(5) Various Beautiful Patterns: Among the beautiful patterns of She stone from various pits, the dragon tail, golden stars, and spiral patterns are the most precious. Dragon tail stone without patterns uses golden stars as patterns, and these three kinds of beautiful patterns have numerous names and strange patterns. Literary scholars and scholars often like to play with them, but the Stone Forest Summer Retreat Record once said that She inkstones have lacked good materials for a long time, and dragon tails are no longer what they used to be, and spiral patterns and eyebrow patterns are no longer seen. This shows the preciousness of these three kinds of stones. Therefore, they are described in detail below.</p>
<p>1. Dragon Tail Stone: Produced in water, it is firm, dense, warm, and moist. The sound is clear and melodious like jade. The color is dark black, with varying shades. It is particularly good if it is smooth and has many edges. The stone pattern with golden stars is the most precious. (1) The most precious is when the stars are tightly clustered like a dragon's tail, (2) The stars that are dotted like morning stars, (3) The ones that are as dense as sprinkled gold, (4) The ones with fine circles like falling flowers, (5) The ones that are all gold skin are the worst. Golden stars are always dominated by glittering gold, and pale yellow is not worthy of being precious.</p>
<p>2. Spiral Pattern Stone: The predecessors said that the spiral pattern stone starts ink better than the dragon tail. The color is blue-green. The slightly finer coarse spiral pattern is easier to grind ink. The slightly harder fine spiral pattern produces the most ink. It is also said that the spiral pattern is like rice grains, moist, dense, firm, heavy, and flawless. It is the wonder of inkstones. The spiral pattern names recorded in the Inkstone Note are a total of twelve kinds, which are listed below.</p>
<p>Fine Spiral Pattern: The most moist and warm with a blue color, and it is considered upper-grade without stars.</p>
<p>Dark Fine Spiral Pattern: The stone is blue-black and not exposed. It can only be seen when placed in water.</p>
<p>Ancient Rhino Spiral Pattern: Slightly finer than the horn wave pattern.</p>
<p>Gua Zi Spiral Pattern: There are spots like melon seeds.</p>
<p>Stone Heart Spiral Pattern: There are subtle fine lines hidden in the center of the stone.</p>
<p>Golden Star Spiral Pattern: The dots are like stars and as thin as eyebrows.</p>
<p>Golden Halo Spiral Pattern: The halo has several layers like a painting.</p>
<p>Golden Flower Spiral Pattern: There are gold-plated flowers on the fine lines.</p>
<p>Strand Spiral Pattern: Slightly like the lines in the palm.</p>
<p>Brush Silk Spiral Pattern: The lines are slightly rough, like brushed with a broom.</p>
<p>Pine Pattern Spiral Pattern: Like the texture of pine wood, slightly brownish-yellow.</p>
<p>Pebble Spiral Pattern: Like an oval shape with blue skin and yellow skin.</p>
<p>The Inkstone Note also states that the coarse spiral pattern, black nail, horn wave, and abacus are not recorded, so it can be seen that the above-mentioned twelve types are only the best ones. However, when we study She inkstones, we cannot limit ourselves to the best ones. Therefore, the discarded sub-products are also recorded below.</p>
<p>Coarse Spiral Pattern: The eyes are slightly rough and the stone texture is not very fine.</p>
<p>Abacus Spiral Pattern: Also known as abacus strips, like bamboo in an abacus.</p>
<p>Horn Wave Spiral Pattern: Like triangular water wave patterns.</p>
<p>Date Heart Spiral Pattern: Like a date pit shape, there are two types, thick and thin.</p>
<p>Raindrop Spiral Pattern: Like falling rain, also known as black nail pattern.</p>
<p>Fish Roe Spiral Pattern: Like small fish traveling in groups.</p>
<p>The above are the sub-products of the spiral pattern. The spiral pattern is divided into interior mountain and exterior mountain. The predecessors only said that the golden stars of the interior mountain spiral pattern are sparse and slow, and the exterior mountain spiral pattern is similar to the fine spiral pattern and slightly rough. However, how to distinguish between the interior and exterior mountains is very rarely seen by us, and I am ashamed that I cannot explain it in detail.</p>

<h3 id="e218">A Chart for Inspecting the Reactance of Inductors and Capacitors <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— An Ignoramus</p>
<p>Sometimes, to know the reactance of inductors and capacitors in order to determine the alternating current values in radio frequency and audio frequency circuits, these two formulas are commonly used: (1) To find magnetic inductive reactance XL = 2πfL; (2) To find capacitive reactance Xc = 1/(2πfC). Calculating using these two formulas is quite cumbersome and prone to errors due to the decimal places involved. Now, there is a chart for inspecting the reactance of inductors and capacitors. If the capacitance of the inductor and capacitor is known, its reactance can be found immediately, which is very convenient. The diagram is as follows:</p>
<p>[Space]</p>
<p>Capacitance ( )</p>
<p>Usage</p>
<p>This chart is N-shaped, divided into three sections: A, B, and C. Section A is for wavelength. Section B is divided into two subsections: (1) and (2). Subsection (1) is the magnetic inductive reactance to be inspected, and subsection (2) is the capacitive reactance to be inspected. Section C also has two subsections: (1) and (2). Subsection (1) is for inductance, and subsection (2) is for capacitance. Usage examples:</p>
<p>(1) An inductor has a capacitance of one hundred megahenries. What is its reactance at a wavelength of 100 meters?</p>
<p>Solution: First, find the one-megahenry point on subsection (1) of section C. Then, find the 100-meter point on section A. Use a ruler to intersect these two points on section B. The magnetic inductive reactance at the intersection point is approximately L00 ohms, which is the desired value.</p>
<p>(2) A capacitor has a capacitance of 0.0002 farads. What is its reactance at a wavelength of 100 meters?</p>
<p>Solution: Similar to the first example, find the 0.0002-farad and 100-meter points. The capacitive reactance at the intersection point is found to be approximately 265 ohms.</p>
<p>If the reactance of a certain inductor and capacitor is known at a certain wavelength, its inductance and capacitance can be inspected on the chart.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Design of a Power Amplifier <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Jiancun</p>
<p>In a radio, the power amplifier is a part that consumes a lot of power. If batteries are used, the cost is quite high, which is somewhat unsatisfactory. With the invention of the eliminator, the function of the power amplifier in AC radios has gradually become widespread.</p>
<p>The vacuum tube is the main component required for a power amplifier. The vacuum tube used must have a characteristic that can withstand a sufficiently wide range of grid voltage amplitudes. Commonly used tubes are UX171A, UX210, UX250, UX245, UX202, etc., among which the UX245 is the most common.</p>
<p>The first diagram shows a power amplifier, which is the final stage circuit in a radio. The relationship between its AC input voltage and AC output voltage can be determined based on the following four important characteristics:</p>
<p>(1) The amplification factor of the vacuum tube; (2) The plate resistance of the vacuum tube; (3) The total load impedance of the plate circuit (Load impedance); (4) The DC voltage of the grid and plate.</p>
<p>First Diagram</p>
<p>In the first diagram, let Eg be the AC voltage of the grid (input circuit). Then, the following AC voltage is generated in the plate circuit (output circuit):</p>
<p>Ep = uEg ······ (1)</p>
<p>In the above formula, Ep is the plate AC voltage, and u is the amplification factor. Then, the plate current ip can be obtained by the following formula:</p>
<p>uEg</p>
<p>Ip = | | ···· (2)</p>
<p>Rp + Ro</p>
<p>In formula (2), RP is the plate resistance, and RO is the total load impedance. Thus, the power P generated in the total load impedance RO should be:</p>
<p>2 2</p>
<p>2UEGRO</p>
<p>P = IPRO = | | ···· (3)</p>
<p>(RO + RO)2</p>
<p>Taking the UX171A tube as an example, find the output when RO is 4000 ohms. According to the characteristics of the UX171A tube, the highest peak voltage (PEAK Voltage) of EG is 40 volts, RP is 2000 ohms, and u is 3. When calculating, the highest peak voltage must be converted to the effective value, which is</p>
<p>40 x 0.707 = 28 volts</p>
<p>Using formula (3), the power can be obtained as follows:</p>
<p>9 x 784 x 4000</p>
<p>P = | | | | = 0.784 watts</p>
<p>(2000 + 4000)2</p>

<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>The ink on the international peace treaty is not yet dry, and all countries are painstakingly preparing for the next World War. Continental countries such as France, Italy, the United States, and Russia are concentrating their efforts to develop their land and space authority, while Britain, in order to maintain the glory of its naval supremacy, is constantly seeking new methods to command its navy.</p>
<p>British naval experts want to use radio to control their battleships from a considerable distance, so that their actions are completely under command. Not only that, but in wartime, all the work on the ship, such as firing guns, launching cannons, laying mines, and releasing smoke bombs, is controlled by radio, without the need for a single soldier. This dream began in 1925 and has been continuously tested, and has now been largely successful.</p>
<p>Although the principle of radio remote control is extremely simple, the equipment is extremely complex. A signal is emitted from the control station using a specific wavelength (similar to the transmitting device of a radio telegraph). The controlled battleship has a highly sensitive receiving device that is pre-tuned to the wavelength of the control signal. When this signal is received, the output current of the radio causes a weak jump, which can activate a corresponding relay. The closing of each relay can affect the steering compass, causing the battleship to sail in a certain corresponding direction, and the actions of each relay can be completely controlled by different signals.</p>
<p>Controlling the sailing of a battleship is relatively easy. The most difficult task is to control the use of weapons on the battleship, such as loading ammunition and aiming (this work may be done by radio transmission in the near future). After a long period of experimentation, a relatively simple machine has now been invented to make aiming extremely effective. First, two circular transparent sheets are installed on an airplane, each of which is divided into several degrees and numbered. At the same time, a table track with the same degrees and numbers is also set up on the controlled battleship. The reconnaissance pilot on the airplane looks at the target to be bombarded below through this circular sheet. If the enemy ship is found at a certain degree on the circular sheet, say four, he immediately sends a signal [four] to the control ship. The control ship immediately uses radio to calibrate the table track on the battleship so that it is also four, and then fires the cannon. At this time, the reconnaissance pilot on the airplane must pay attention to the point where the cannonball lands. If it is very close to the enemy ship, the splash can be observed through the circular sheet at the adjacent number, say five. Immediately send another signal [five] to the control ship. Then, the control ship uses radio to control the table track on the battleship again, so that the range of the cannonball is appropriate. If the reconnaissance plane directly controls the battleship, it can be even faster.</p>
<p>In future wars, a large fleet of warships can be controlled by radio from a very light and fast small boat, so that all actions are under the command of the commander.</p>
<h3 id="e221">On Low-Frequency Amplification <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Low-frequency amplification (Audio Frequency Amplification) occupies an important part in larger radios that use loudspeakers for sound reproduction. It has a significant impact on the overall efficiency of the radio, especially in terms of the volume and sound quality of the radio's output. Its quality entirely depends on the low-frequency amplification stage, so it is essential when designing a radio. However, novice radio researchers often fail to achieve excellent results due to a lack of understanding of the characteristics of various low-frequency amplification configurations and improper installation. In view of this, the author ventures to provide a simple explanation of the commonly used low-frequency amplification configurations, hoping that novice comrades can learn from them.</p>
<p>(Diagram 1)</p>
<p>(1) Transformer Coupling Amplification (Diagram 1) This type of amplification configuration is the most common, as it can obtain high sound amplification with only a small amount of power. However, when combined with a powerful output tube, the increased B voltage can easily cause distortion. If designed comprehensively—such as correcting the grid voltage and adding shunt capacitors—distortion can also be reduced.</p>
<p>(Diagram 2)</p>
<p>(2) Resistance Coupling Amplification (Diagram 2) This amplifier consists of a non-inductive resistor connected with a fixed capacitor. Because this type of resistor can maintain its constant value at any frequency, even when used in high-level amplification and final-stage power amplification, its output can still be distortion-free. Its sound quality is excellent, clear, and far superior to that of transformer amplification.</p>
<p>(Diagram 3)</p>
<p>(3) Push-Pull Amplifier (Diagram 3) If you want strong sound, excellent sound quality, and no distortion, this is the only option. Generally, large-power radios and pickups use this type. However, due to its excessive power consumption, ordinary small-scale radios do not use it much. Moreover, since the invention of the pentode power tube, researchers generally believe that a single-stage audio frequency power amplification is enough to enjoy.</p>
<p>The above three low-frequency amplification configurations are the most common. In addition, there are (Loftin-White) direct coupling amplification and transformer-resistance coupling amplification, etc. Due to space limitations, they will be described in detail for readers on another day.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Voltage Doubling Method for Rectifiers <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— An Ignoramus</p>
<p>When rectifier tubes are used in ordinary rectifier circuits, using half-wave or full-wave rectification can only increase or decrease the ripple current. It cannot increase the output DC voltage to twice the AC voltage supplied to the plate before rectification. Now, if a special circuit is used, it can produce a DC voltage that is exactly twice the original AC voltage. This connection method is called the voltage doubling method for rectifiers.</p>
<p>Diagram 1</p>
<p>Diagram 1 shows a half-wave rectifier tube connected in a voltage doubling method.</p>
<p>If a triode is used to replace it, the grid must be connected in parallel with the plate. If a full-wave rectifier tube such as 80 or 82 is used, the two plates must be connected in parallel. If the input AC voltage to this rectifier is 110V, the output DC voltage can reach around 240V.</p>
<p>Diagram 2</p>
<p>Diagram 2 shows the voltage doubling connection method for a 25Z5 voltage doubling rectifier tube.</p>
<p>The principle of voltage doubling is easier to understand with reference to Diagram 2. Because the two plates of this tube have two capacitors C1 and C2 connected across them alternately, the change in positive and negative polarity is used, as if two half-waves are connected together. When plate P1 is rectifying, capacitor C1 connected across plate P2 is discharging. Therefore, the combined output DC voltage is the sum of the plate voltage of the rectifying plate and the discharge voltage of the capacitor, which is exactly twice the original input AC voltage.</p>
<p>The installation of the filter is the same as usual. C1, C2, and C3 are 4-microfarad filter capacitors that must withstand a high voltage of 400V. The inductor is 30 henries. A voltage divider resistor can be connected to the output DC voltage to adjust to an appropriate voltage.</p>
<p>(Note) For radios that use this type of voltage doubling rectifier and whose AC power supply for the plate voltage is directly taken from the live wire (i.e., without using a step-up transformer), if a ground wire is used, a 1-microfarad high-voltage capacitor must be connected in series with the cathode to prevent the rectifier tube from short-circuiting and being damaged.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Inductors and Capacitors <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Huaxin</p>
<p>Inductors and capacitors are important components of AC-powered radios. Their function is to filter out the ripple in the rectified DC current, transforming it into a very pure DC current. Therefore, the two are called the filter stage in the rectifier.</p>
<p>An inductor is the same as an ordinary coil, but the inductance used in a rectifier must be very large—approximately 30 henries. Therefore, the center is made of iron core. In high-quality inductors,</p>
<p>(1) there should be an air gap because its inductance is much larger than that of the same inductor without an air gap.</p>
<p>(2) The DC resistance should be small, otherwise the voltage drop will be too large when current passes through it, and the output voltage will be greatly reduced. Although the output voltage of the rectification part can be increased to compensate, it is often not possible to increase it excessively due to the rectifier tube, which affects the results.</p>
<p>However, for the sake of simplicity, the excitation coil is used instead of the inductor in radios using electrodynamic loudspeakers, which is also very suitable. However, the resistance of the excitation coil is very large, so the voltage drop is also large, and the output voltage of the rectification part must be increased during design.</p>
<p>When in use, inductors are mostly connected to the positive side, but the effect is still very good when connected to the negative side.</p>
<p>The capacitors used in this part must have high voltage resistance and large capacitance, and the price must be low. There are usually the following three types, each with advantages and disadvantages. If they are properly matched, the effect is almost the same.</p>
<p>1. Mica-insulated capacitors: They can withstand very high voltages and are very suitable for filtering work. However, the value is extremely high, and it cannot be purchased by amateur enthusiasts.</p>
<p>2. Electrolytic capacitors: They take up very little space and can save on the volume of the radio. However, the voltage resistance is not high, about 400 volts, so when used in voltages higher than 400 volts, several must be connected in series. For example, connecting two of the same capacitance in series, the voltage resistance is 800 volts, and the capacitance is only one-half of each. If configured properly, the value is not expensive, and the effect is great. As for the service life, according to the manufacturer, it can be used for eight or nine years, but it is usually damaged due to excessive voltage. This type of capacitor has positive and negative polarity when connecting, so pay attention when using it.</p>
<p>3. Paper capacitors: This type of capacitor is the cheapest, and the voltage resistance is also low, about 200 volts. It is very suitable for use in small radios, and it can also be connected in series like electrolytic capacitors. It is said that the service life is only one or two years, but according to my experience, if the voltage does not exceed the specified value, it can also be used for several years. This type of capacitor is not used much in the power supply part of imported radios. Electrolytic capacitors are commonly used. The biggest use is as a bypass capacitor, such as being connected in parallel with a resistor to replace C battery, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Points to Note When Making Your Own Power Transformer <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yi</p>
<p>Amateur enthusiasts who study radio should focus on interest and economy, so when playing with AC machines, they prefer to make their own power transformers. However, when winding such small transformers, the following points should be paid attention to so that its efficiency can be high and it is also very durable.</p>
<p>(1) Accurate design: Regarding the design aspect, this magazine and other magazines have detailed guidance, which will not be repeated. However, when designing, you should pay attention to whether the frequency applicable to the iron core in the winding table is the frequency of the local power supply. For example, if the table states that it is suitable for 60 cycles, and the local frequency is 25 cycles, then the iron core area must be increased to 2.1 to 2.2 times to be sufficient, or the number of turns per volt must be increased. However, power generators rarely use frequencies below 50 cycles.</p>
<p>(2) Accurate wire selection: Most of the wires wound in the power supply framework are enameled wires, because they are cheap and small in size. There are usually two types sold on the market: SWG (British Standard) and B&amp;S (American Standard). The two wires of the same number have different current carrying capacities. The British Standard NO. 20 enameled wire has exactly the same current carrying capacity as the American Standard No. 19 enameled wire. The British 30-gauge wire is equivalent to the American 28-gauge wire, so when buying wire, you should match the standard used on the table so that there will be no loss in any aspect in terms of economy, position, and durability. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Arrival of new machines from the Radio Corporation of America in Shanghai. Stewart ten-tube and five-tube radios have long been famous. The latest ten-tube machine arrived last time and was sold out in a few days, which can be said to be extremely fast, which is due to the excellent quality of the parts. Now the second batch of new goods has arrived in Shanghai and will be out of storage soon. This time, the machine has clear sound, durability, power saving, beautiful style, and the selling price is very low. All major electrical appliance stores have them for sale. If you have not prepared a radio, please reserve it early so that you can get it first.</p>
<p>Recent situation of Tian'er Radio Company: This company is a leader in repairing radios. Recently, due to the development of its business, it has specially hired three engineers, all of whom are deeply skilled in repairing radios. In the future, the repair work will be more reliable and fast.</p>
<p>Great Shanghai Radio Company, No. 49 Nanjing Road, telephone number 14996, has special experience in repairing power transformers in radios. Mr. Qiu from Ningbo had a Stewart six-tube machine whose power transformer was damaged. It was sent to the company for repair. After the repair, he was very satisfied with the use. Mr. Qiu twice forgot to turn off the radio and it was on for 18 consecutive hours, but the power transformer inside the machine was still intact. This shows that the company does not do anything sloppily when repairing radios, so it has achieved such good results.</p>

<p>In the past five or six years, foreign movies first showed us the bravery of foreign heroes, then the inferiority of barbarians, and then the curved beauty of foreign ladies. But our horizons are expanding, and eventually a few legs are not enough, so there is a large expanse; and then it is not enough, so there is nakedness. This is [Nude Movement Grand Photography], although it is a proper [Expression of Human Beauty and Healthy Beauty], it is also [A Child Blocks the Way], they are not worthy to see these [Beauty].</p>
<p>Why? There is such text in the promotion —</p>
<p>[A very smart child said: Why don't they turn their bodies around?]</p>
<p>[A very upright father said: No wonder theaters block children!]</p>
<p>This is of course just a wonderful text imagined by a writer, because the film is marked with [A Child Blocks the Way] from the beginning, and they have no way to see it. But if they really let them see it, would they ask such questions? I think, maybe they will. However, the meaning of this question is probably completely different from what Zhang Sheng sang [Alas, why don't you turn your face around?], it is actually the unnatural attitude of the people in the movie that makes him feel strange. Chinese children may be relatively precocious, or maybe they are more sensitive to sex, but they are not as unclean as their adult [father]. If this is the case, the Chinese society twenty years later would be truly terrible, but in fact it will probably never be the case, so the answer is better changed:</p>
<p>[Because they want to make me unsatisfied, how hateful!]</p>
<p>But there are probably not many [fathers] who are willing to say this. He always has to [use his own heart to measure the hearts of others], and after measuring, he forcibly stuffs this heart into the cavity of others, pretending that it is not his own, and saying that the hearts of others are not as clean as his. The nude women all [do not turn their bodies around], in fact, it is specifically to deal with this type of people. Are they idiots, don't they even know that the eyes of the [father] are more unruly than those of his children?</p>
<p>However, Chinese society is still a society of [fathers], so the plays are performed by the [mothers] dedicating themselves and the [sons] being slandered. Even at the critical moment, it is still something like [Mulan Joins the Army], [Wang Yi Defends the Country], to push out [women and villains] to perfunctorily deal with the situation.

<p>Liu Dasheng's theory of [Being an Official and Acting in a Play] says: [The most serious thing in the world is called being an official, and the most illusory thing is called acting in a play. But I am very foolish. Every time I see singing, crying, laughing, scolding, fighting, and joking in the theater, I recognize it as real. The truth is not in the disguised ancient people, but in the actors who play the ancient people, each with parents, wives, and children, each needing to support their families, each using crying, laughing, fighting, and scolding to support their parents and support their wives and children. These actors are true ancient people. And every time I put on a crown and belt, dress up and act, I am indeed a true official, and no one in the world suspects me of being an actor. It is not known that the officials who bow and sit, have joyous faces and smiling mouths, and those who put on a stern face and are awed by their majesty, are actually these ancient people who support their families, cry and laugh. They take a theater, props, script, and acting style, and use their entire internal organs for the play, and they themselves are not aware that they are true actors.

<p>Literary people often have strange ideas, and the poor often open up new avenues, completely irrational. For example, the aforementioned filling of hunger with nature is one example; Tang Yi's theory of the jar is also an excellent article. He said: [My sick body is drifting and there is nowhere to return, so I will stay in a lonely temple. There is a bed in the temple but no quilt, and there is a quilt in the inn but no mosquito net. Now I ask the monk to borrow a fish tank, and I sit and lie in it day and night. Friends pity me and stop me, and often warn me not to speak. If the ancients used a jar as a bed, then I have a bed today but no jar, and you should pity me for not having a jar. Having a bed makes me know the pain of not having a mosquito net, but if I don't have a bed, what can I ask for a mosquito net? Please comment on this situation, what do you think of the text?] This kind of speculation, although not whimsical, is also to his credit for thinking of it.</p>

<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Originally, the rise of vernacular Chinese was greatly influenced by Western literature. Therefore, the sentences in vernacular Chinese became complex in structure, often containing many adjectives, adjective phrases, adverbs, and adverb phrases (the so-called Europeanized style). For example, in Guo Moruo's translation of Goethe's *The Sorrows of Young Werther*, there is a sentence:</p>
<p>[When the beautiful valley around me steamed, the bright sun shone on the densely shaded forest, only two or three rays of light stole into the holy place within the forest, I would lie on the deep grass beside the stream, and the countless fine grasses on the ground would cling closer to the ground and be noticed by me: my heart would feel even more closely the buzzing of the small world among the grasses, the uncountable and inexhaustible kinds of insects and gnats, and I would feel the existence of the Almighty; He created us according to His form; I would feel the breath of the All-Benevolent, He supports us floating in this eternal joy.]</p>
<p>The entire sentence contains 158 characters. The first adverbial phrase (from "when" "then") has 42 characters, and it also contains three short clauses, each of which contains many "words" and "phrases." This complex structure was not found in classical Chinese before. In European literature, not all adopt such a complex structure. For example, in a Nordic narrative cited by Lafcadio Hearn, there are only ten adjectives in 750 words. However, complex structures are common in the literary styles of England and Southern European countries. (Wu Guangjian's translation of Dumas's *The Count of Monte Cristo* into classical Chinese deleted many sub-clauses or straightened out compound sentences.) Vernacular Chinese, influenced by Europeanization, has made sentences very complex, which we should recognize as a kind of progress.</p>
<p>In fact, the complexity of modern writing and the simplicity of ancient writing are inevitable considering the tools used and the objects described. Zhang Shizhai said: [Ancient people wrote books on lacquered bamboo slips, or on silk, or with knives to scrape off mistakes. It was cumbersome and unbearable, so the writing was concise and strict, with no redundant sentences in the chapters and no redundant words in the sentences. This was because writing was difficult, so they were forced to write only to express their meaning sufficiently. They not only disdained being verbose, but also had no time to be verbose. Now that paper and pen are used for writing, it is ten times easier than using bamboo, silk, and knives. The verbosity and rambling nature of writing can then be done as one pleases. Although there are inherent shifts in the style and quality of writing with the times, it is common for people to be indulgent in what is easy and convenient, and to be cautious and strict when it is difficult and cumbersome.] (Yimao Notes). He has pointed out the connection between tools and writing style. Now that mechanical industry is booming and tools are readily available, their convenience is a hundredfold greater than in the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods. It is inevitable that writing styles will become unrestrained. In classical Chinese, Wang Anshi's ten-thousand-word memorial was already considered a grand spectacle. Today, when people write, such as Liang Qichao's preface to Jiang Baili's *History of the Renaissance*, it is written to sixty or seventy thousand words. This is something that ancient people could not have dreamed of. In the past, writers lived in rural agricultural societies, leading simple and leisurely lives. The objects they wrote about, such as nature and small towns, changed very little. At the beginning of writing, they considered carefully; after writing, they revised carefully. They could do such fine polishing work to make the articles appear very concise. Now, the metropolises created by industrial society have too complex lives and too rapid changes. The old saying describing the crowding of cities was [cars like flowing water, horses like dragons]. Using this to describe the streets of Shanghai today is not entirely accurate. The old saying describing the evening scenery was [ten thousand homes lit up]. How can the [ten thousand homes lit up] describe the [red] colored neon of Shanghai's night scene today? Since the words and phrases used to describe things in the past are exhausted, the large increase in adjectives and adverbs is a necessary product of the times. Today's writers in big cities, as soon as the ink touches the paper, the manuscript is sent for typesetting, with no room for maneuvering. Those engaged in the news business sometimes do not even have the leisure to consider. The rambling nature of words and phrases is a factual necessity. Therefore, the lengthiness of words and phrases can be said to be a shortcoming of vernacular Chinese, but it can also be said to be a strength of vernacular Chinese. It is still difficult to say whether it is right or wrong. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>｜Room Without Windows, Essay Three｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, I mentioned a very popular female celebrity to a village school principal. He shook his head and said:</p>
<p>[Don't know]!</p>
<p>I didn't say anything, but my expression probably showed something, and he said very bluntly: [What, too ignorant]?</p>
<p>[Too ignorant]. This sentence touched me, and I felt very uncomfortable, so I found some more things from this.</p>
<p>If you talk to a country person about the fluttering figures in a dance hall, or about people moving and talking on the screen, he (or she) will be as surprised as if hearing a heavenly book. If you tell him that a meal in the city costs tens of dollars, he will definitely stick out his tongue.</p>
<p>The people in the countryside, in today's situation where economic bankruptcy is like quicksand that cannot be held back in a rapid current, are struggling for a living in poverty, barely holding on with only a single pair of pants to fight against the cold north wind. Nothing else can reach their hearts. People living in the city can only take the bankruptcy of the countryside as a term. If you ask him what it looks like when it's bankrupt, if he's honest, he'll answer: [Don't know].</p>
<p>I remember in the high-rise buildings of the school, when I was bored on winter nights, I would call a worker to pour a pot of tea. Then, with the red stove fire, everyone would gather around, each lying in an Andover chair, smoking a cigarette, and various opinions would slowly emerge from the smoke. You approve of this ideology, I sympathize with that [style], and we seem to become enemies. At first, there's a little noisy debate, but later we simply argue with red faces and pound the table, each seeming to have won the oral battle, and that ideology or [style] can be realized immediately. As a result, everyone suffers from insomnia.</p>
<p>This is a kind of verbal ideology. An after-dinner pastime [style]. If you ask what the current situation in the countryside is, I'm afraid no one [knows]. Not only are university students like this. There are many works written about the bankruptcy of the countryside right now. If you are a real country person, those three words will shut the writer's mouth! Because what he writes is imagined or observed from a transcendent position.</p>
<p>Generally, people sing loudly about rural relief, but while singing, they can't help but do things that further accelerate the speed of bankruptcy. In their eyes, rural bankruptcy is on the statistical numbers. If you ask them about the real situation, it's also:</p>
<p>[Don't know].</p>

<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>The slowly moving队伍 finally finished Weixin Street and walked onto Henan Street. This is the busiest street in the whole city. Usually, there are countless pedestrians, but at this time, it is even more crowded, cutting off traffic. I don't understand what these people are watching! No, they are probably watching female students. Female students have always been the object of appreciation and evaluation by these leisurely docile people. Of course, they are unwilling to give up this rare moment of right.</p>
<p>Clearly, I heard people on the side of the road criticize people in our team:</p>
<p>[That little guy is really good-looking, his eyes are so lively].</p>
<p>[The one with the thick calves is also good, your vision is not good].</p>
<p>[No, the one wearing patent leather shoes is still good, the willow waist is very flirtatious].</p>
<p>At the same time, I also heard someone cursing with pain:</p>
<p>[Enjoying themselves, such decent slaves of a conquered nation]!</p>
<p>[What's there to see? The more you look, the more angry you get. Pleasing the Japanese]!</p>
<p>[Ah! Time passes so quickly, it's been almost two years].</p>
<p>Hearing these kinds of words turned all the anger in my stomach into sadness, but from this, I clearly saw that the people's hearts have not completely died. One day, the large group of oppressed slaves will turn over.</p>
<p>All the rickshaws and horse carriages on the street were hiding on the side of the street, unable to move. The police were driving away the improperly dressed crowd. Smoothly, in a short while, the team arrived at the stadium.</p>
<p>There were more people in the stadium than on the street. The following twenty characters were posted high on the gate:</p>
<p>[Commemoration of the 19.18 Two-Year Anniversary and Celebration of the 9.15 One-Year Recognition Anniversary].</p>
<p>Police and military police were constantly pushing back the crowded audience. Our team calmly walked into the gate of the stadium.</p>
<p>The military band played music frantically, not knowing whether it was celebrating our arrival or praising our obedience. Before long, the students from First Normal School, First Middle School, First Workers' School, County Middle School, Midwifery School, Municipal Elementary School, and County Elementary School also arrived. If we compare today's situation with the grand meeting held here two years ago, the only difference is that a group of new guests have been added to a corner of the stadium, namely the students from the Japanese Tongwen Commercial School and the Japanese Elementary School. In the past, no students from these schools participated in the grand meeting. There is also an opposite fact revealed in the stadium: after the teams of each school were arranged in a certain position, it could be seen that in the teams of Japanese students, small national flags were constantly waving, and people were full of energy, showing excessive happiness, jumping, shouting, and laughing. And we, the students of the conquered nation, regardless of middle school students or elementary school students, were almost all standing there dejectedly, thinking, not jumping, not shouting, and not crying, like a group of idols.</p>
<p>Such a phenomenon is rare. At least, these students have not forgotten their own shame, but what is the use of just passively being sad?</p>
<p>It's getting hot. The autumn sun is especially difficult to bear when it shines on people, and with the people watching the excitement all around, men and women, it's so crowded that even taking a breath seems very difficult. The noisy situation is not like a meeting place about to begin, but like an open-air theater performing a wild opera. After a while, a child cried, after a while someone cursed, and after a while someone made a strange noise. It can be said that their interest in coming here is similar to going to the Beishan Temple Fair on April 28th. The only difference is that they may still have a small hope hidden in their hearts, that is, to admire the demeanor of the noble officials and important people.</p>

<p>Although There is News of Cuban Silver Coinage</p>
<p>Banks' Appetite is Healthy and Market Conditions are Still Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market rose because the silver price lacked upward momentum and the exchange rate continued to shrink. However, the day's situation was mediocre and extremely boring. At the beginning of the market, although overseas silver markets in the UK and the US both rose, the forward silver price on the Metal Exchange only rose by four to one and four tenths of a penny. The exchange rate still fell, London raw gold rose by five pence, US cotton fell by twelve pounds, and US wheat shrank by 0.375. The wool market opened steadily and rose to 54 yuan. The market situation was very flat. However, due to the Associated Press report that the Cuban government will purchase silver worth 3 million to 4 million US dollars in the New York market to repay the US government, people's hearts were softer. After the opening, this remained the case. A Reuters report stated that the US Financial Relief Agency will lend 6,000,000 yuan to the Cuban Import and Export Bank to help it purchase silver worth 8,000,000 yuan, which will be sold to the Cuban government for issuing silver coins. Although the banks are aggressive, it is still difficult to rise. After the market opened, the banks' appetite continued to be healthy, and the domestic market trended tighter and rose. However, supply took advantage of the high price, and it was inevitable that it would fall. At noon, the situation was still stable. The market was quiet in the afternoon, with fluctuations of only eight corners. There was news that the silver futures in the Seattle night market had risen by more than ten pounds. The domestic market trend was slightly looser and declined. However, the trading in the market was sporadic, and there were fewer sellers, so the situation was still flat and perfunctory. The price of pure gold was calculated at 967 yuan. Today's market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 954 yuan and one corner, an increase of 1.6 yuan compared to the previous close. Goods opened at the same price. The opening exchange rate was a recent selling price of 1 shilling and 4 pence and 0.25 for British exchange and 34.875 yuan for US exchange. Although the banks were aggressive when the market opened, Fuchang, Qianchang, Xiangrongkang, etc. all sold, and the market lacked buyers, falling from 4 yuan and 4 corners to 3 yuan and a half. However, as it was known that the HSBC listing had not moved and was still fixed, Macquarie Citi ate US dollars for July at 0.25 and for August at 0.375. Fuyu, Hengyu, Yiyu, Yida, Yongqian, Changxiang, Dacheng, Yicheng, etc. jointly purchased, and it rose to 5 yuan and 6 corners. Datong blocked US dollars for May at 0.9375. Qianchang, Xiangxiang, Zhifeng, Yongsheng, Daheng, Xingyuqingyong, etc. successively supplied orders, and then it fell to 3 yuan and 6 corners. Macquarie ate US dollars for July at 0.25, Mitsui ate US dollars for August at 0.375, Qianchang, Xiangxiang, Fuyu, Fuchang, Tianfeng, and Dacheng bought some. There was a rumor that the Central Bank opened 210 bars at a price of 6 yuan, and it rose to 5 yuan and 1 corner. The noon closing was 954 yuan and 7 corners. The goods were sold at the same price.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 954 yuan and 7 corners. The goods opened at the same price. Shunli Yida Yongjin advanced to 4 yuan and 9 corners, Hengxing sold, and a decline was seen. After the opening, US dollars for August at 0.375 were difficult to sell. There was a saying that the silver price in the Seattle night market had risen by 0.125, breaking the sideways trend, with a small rise and fall. Zhaofeng Changxie Xingyong supplied orders and retreated to 4 yuan and 1 corner. Hengyu came in, rising to outside 4 yuan and a half. Because there was a lack of supply in the market, although Macquarie ate US dollars for August at 0.375, it blocked US dollars for June at 0.0625. US dollars for August at 0.375 were still difficult to sell and continued to decline. However, Hengyu limited purchases to 4 yuan and 2 corners, and no one supplied, so the gold price was pulled up. After that, scattered shorts made minor covers, and Hengchang Yong, etc. slightly advanced, gradually adding to 4 yuan and 8 corners. Tianfeng came to sell, and the closing was 954 yuan and a half. The goods were sold at 4 yuan and 6 corners. After the close, although Hengtai sold, the situation was flat. The highest price of the day was 955 yuan and 6 corners, and the lowest was 953 yuan and a half, a difference of 2.1 yuan. As a result, it closed 2 yuan higher than the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was 34.375 yuan because the HSBC Bank's US dollar listing did not move, and the combined gold fixing price was 1006 yuan, 5 corners and 4 points. According to the closing price, about 52 yuan was pressed, 2 yuan less than the previous close. The account registration price for this month was 956 yuan, and the account registration price for May was 955 yuan. The morning replenishment was 956 yuan, and the afternoon replenishment was at the same price. The price of pure gold was calculated at 967 yuan. The market for calcined gold was calm and flat. The Tianjin gang sold 350 taels to Yingfeng Heng, and it was heard that it was added by 13 yuan. It was heard that 10,000 taels of Tianjin goods were surging and had been delivered to various spot firms. Therefore, the Central Bank had little intention of buying. The previous market had opened 210 bars at a price of 956 yuan. There were still 308 bars of promissory notes for this month.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was flat first and then quiet. In summary, Yifeng Yongyi Dayong Qingfa Yongyuan Chunqian Changxiang Tongfeng Heng Fuyu Yongde Hongxing Tongchun Hengxing Yuanyibingxing, etc. were on the buying side, and Hengxing Yuqingyong Hengchang Yonghuiyuan Fuchang Zhifeng Yonghui Xiangtongyi, etc. were on the selling side. Fuxing Yongheng Yuanyuan Maoshui first went out and then went in. Tianfeng Hengtai advanced first and then went out. The Dalian gang Shunli jointly did about 700, with minimal reconciliation. Wanxing jointly did about 800, with little difference in the reconciliation. The Guang gang Shengda bought and sold more than 700 bars in total, with the reconciliation being flat. Hengxing sold more than 200 bars and bought a small number. As of today, there were a total of 21,119 chips for May, with a total of 37 bulls and 56 bears. The total number of transactions on the day was 24,899 in the morning and only 5,341 in the afternoon.</p>

Compared to the previous close, British exchange was flat, and US exchange was also tighter by 0.0625. After the opening, the banks were healthy. The HSBC listing announced that both British and American exchanges were flat. After the opening, it gradually tightened. At noon, it was slightly flat. Although Chinese merchants blocked, the banks still accepted forwards. The afternoon process was mediocre. The potential was looser. The silver price in the Seattle night market rose by more than ten pounds. Forward US dollars were difficult for Chinese merchants to block out.

<p>Yesterday's market situation was even worse than the previous day. On the surface, the foreign exchange market remained the same as before, with both the morning and afternoon markets being 0.05, but in reality, there were many white settlements, indicating that the expenses were small and the market was not strong, eventually leading to people's laziness and a sluggish atmosphere. Although there was a morning price of 0.02 yesterday, the head covering ultimately felt that the supply exceeded the demand, and the situation was unusually loose and excessive. The transfer of accounts for the discount ticket transaction was more than 4.7 million in the morning market, more than 100,000 in new transactions, and more than 200,000 in afternoon transactions.

<p>A Farmer's Stone of Rice Endures a Thousand Hardships and Sorrows</p>
<p>How Much Can Be Earned with Sweat and Blood</p>
<p>Because of the reduction of the斛司's (measurement office) small fees, a situation of 斛停 (suspension of measurement) has occurred, which has been going on for two days. This cannot but lead to thinking about the various expenses of a farmer's stone of rice coming to Shanghai to sell. The farmers have exhausted their hands and feet in planting rice, but unexpectedly, they suffer a lot of losses in selling it. This is such pain!</p>
<p>Because they cannot directly find consumers, they have to invest in buying and selling. It is understandable that brokers collect commissions for selling on their behalf. As for everything else, although it is said that it is all paid by the brokers, this money does not belong to the brokers. The wool comes from the sheep. Ultimately, the loss is borne by the seller, and the seller is the ultimate bearer - the farmer.</p>
<p>Not to mention other places, just take the example of transporting rice from the interior to Shanghai. The external expenses for a stone of rice are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Water freight 1.5 corners This is an average approximate number. In reality, it ranges from as little as 1 corner and 1 or 2 to as much as 1 corner and 7 or 8.</p>
<p>(2) 斛力 (measuring force) 24 wen This is the labor fee that the broker pays to the 斛司. In reality, it also comes from the seller.</p>
<p>(3) Small account 3 points This is a kind of tip that the seller pays to the 斛司, which is now open.</p>
<p>(4) Sticking to the car 3.5 points This is a kind of tip for carrying from the rice boat to the car on the pier.</p>
<p>張袋(bag spreading) 10 wen This is for the broker to use for the coolies.</p>
<p>(5) 回船(return boat) 568 wen This is the return money that the broker gives to the boatman after the rice 斛 is unloaded clearly. Based on a boat, it is calculated at 200 stones per boat, which is equivalent to 3 wen per stone.</p>
<p>(6) 經售(selling through) 5 points That is, the seller who sells goods to the broker from the seller's hand also takes commissions from it.</p>
<p>(7) 行佣(brokerage commission) 2 corners This is the commission money charged by the broker, but 6 points of it is returned to the rice shop as loading and unloading fees, etc., and after deducting miscellaneous fees of about 1 point, the broker actually receives about 1.3 corners.</p>
<p>(8) 耗米(rice consumption) 2 sheng This means that the seller delivers one stone of rice to the boatman to sell in Shanghai. In addition to paying the water freight, the boatman must also deduct 1 or 2 sheng of rice per stone as consumption. That is, the seller actually receives only 98% of the silver for one stone of rice. If the rice price is calculated according to the current rice price, it is already 1.6 corners. The higher the rice price, the greater the income.</p>
<p>In addition, there are public office donations, 2 wen for Changbang and 7 wen for Nanbang. That is, the above-mentioned various expenses have been calculated to be 6.4 corners, which is the loss of the farmers and also the increased burden of consumers.</p>
<p>Compared with 30 years ago (calculated at 1,000 wen per yuan), the cost per stone at that time was as follows:</p>
<p>Brokerage commission 7 points 斛力(measuring force) 4 wen 斛司小帳(斛司 small account) 1 point 駁力(駁力) 0.012 經售(selling through) 1 point</p>
<p>Although there are still water freight, etc., there is a much bigger difference compared to now.</p>
<p>Therefore, if a farmer adds taxes, land taxes, and local donations to a stone of rice, how much can he earn at the current rice price? To relieve the rural areas and help the farmers, there must be practical efforts.</p>
<p>Cargo exchange miscellaneous payments collected and delivered more than 2.3 million, and 500,000 were shipped out. The money house collected and delivered more than 39 million foreign public orders. The foreign劃頭 款 (劃頭 payments) collected and delivered more than 5.3 million, various exchange payments more than 900,000, cash received 400,000 to 500,000, source from customer roads 100,000, go to load Yangtze River and inland 500,000. Also, the total number of exchanges by the bill exchange in this city on the 6th, silver dollars 6,099,010 yuan, 0.41, including silver dollars 3,628,912 yuan, 0.48, exchange划銀元(划銀元 exchange)2,470,097 yuan, 0.93.</p>

<p>New Fung Foreign Exchange reported on the New York stock market, stating that yesterday's market was mixed and calm. However, towards the end, public utility stocks experienced a rally, causing a slight ripple. This was due to the failure of Governor Lehman's public utility government operation plan in the New York State Senate. Special stocks were particularly strong. The changes in major stocks like U.S. Steel, American Can, and General Electric were minimal throughout the day. The small exchange market was slightly higher, and speculative bonds reached new peaks. High-grade bonds were firm, and U.S. government bonds were mostly slightly higher. Foreign government bonds were mixed and slightly higher. According to agent reports, bulls took profits, but the footing was firm. Wheat lacked buyers, and news was dull. Countryside transportation was sluggish, and conditions in producing areas were generally smooth, except for drought in several areas in the Northwest and Southwest. Cotton was in a hesitant state due to pending legislation and unstable foreign financial news, but trading was still considered good. European Continent's selling was absorbed by the industry. Business leaders remained optimistic about the future of commerce. Johnson's proposal, prohibiting further loans to countries that have failed to repay their debts, has been passed by both houses of Congress, which will affect exports. Current futures are calm, with a total trading volume of 1,420,000 shares for the day. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. Actual demand was slightly active, with the most diligent procurement still from the Southern ports. Other domestic ports were less enthusiastic, but selling prices were still difficult to raise due to excessive inventory and competitive sales among factories. As prices rose, selling increased. Judging from the market situation, the period of continuous decline was too long, triggering profit-taking and short covering, resulting in a rebound of two to three yuan.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Rises Slightly</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened with American cotton at average levels and a lack of sellers. All months rose by two jiao, with distant months rising by two jiao. In the afternoon, some profit-takers covered shorts, and all months rose by four, five, six, and seven jiao. The total daily trading volume was 23,900 bales. The sales breakdown was as follows: Taifoo 1,200 bales, Chang Yu 450 bales, Ming De 400 bales, Dachangcheng 400 bales, Yiyu 600 bales, Dachang 900 bales, Tonghe 600 bales. Purchases were as follows: Xie Sheng 800 bales, Huikang 1,100 bales, Taixing 600 bales, Daji 1,000 bales, Chunji 450 bales, Dafeng 650 bales, Hengde 500 bales, Tongxing 550 bales, and Shenji 450 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Total 190,100</p>
<p>South China Still Actively Purchasing Spot Goods</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are more active. The total daily purchases by various guilds were 1,160 bales. Prices are average. The purchase amounts by various guilds are as follows:</p>
<p>Northern Guild 40, Henan 204, Jiangxi 5, Inland 230, Yunnan 160, Zhenjiang 5, Guangdong 500, Ningbo 5, Xiamen 13, Peers 2, Haizhou 95</p>
<h3 id="e244">This Month's Cotton Futures May See a Short Squeeze <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market, which had been falling for many days, rose by four rupees due to the rise in Indian cotton during the holiday, but American cotton was average. However, selling pressure in the market was not strong. At the same time, most people believe that cotton inventory is low, which is inversely proportional to cotton yarn. Therefore, a certain bank absorbed a large amount of cotton and firmly refused to release it. It is rumored that there will not be much delivery, and there may be a short squeeze later. The market rose as a result, but the cotton market is unlikely to rise significantly due to the slump in the yarn market.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Trends Higher</p>
<p>The marked cotton futures market opened higher in the near months and average in the distant months, with all months rising by one to two jiao. In the afternoon, the current month rose by another two jiao, and the distant months rose by one jiao. The total daily trading volume was 65,500 dan. The sales breakdown was as follows: Yuan Da 5,300 dan, Suilong 1,200 dan, Yiyu 1,000 dan, Dachang 1,700 dan, Tongfu 1,500 dan, Tongxing 1,000 dan. Purchases were as follows: Huikang 1,000 dan, Dafu 1,300 dan, Chunji 1,400 dan, Shenji 1,200 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,500 dan, Changfeng 2,700 dan, Shenchang 1,100 dan, Hengde 1,200 dan.

<p>Total 634,700</p>
<p>Factory Demand is Active</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are still active, but selling prices are still average. The sources are estimated as 150 bales of Yao cotton and 680 bales of Tong cotton. Spot cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 32.50 Yufeng Factory purchases 83 pieces, spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 51.73 Gongda Factory purchases 82 pieces, spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market fell due to the lack of major buyers, foreign merchants selling, and poor spot demand. As a result, spot prices fell by five British pounds, and futures fell by seven to eight British pounds. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by eight points, and futures rose by two to three points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by five points. The Bombay cotton market was calm due to European exporters selling swaps for July and August. As a result, Pingal was unchanged, Omra rose by half a rupee, and White Rose rose by one rupee. The original telegram is listed on the left (telegram dated the 5th):</p>

<h3 id="e247">Northern Guild's Strong Procurement Drives Period Flour to Rise Sharply and Cover Shorts <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, was driven by the Northern Guild's heavy procurement in recent days, successively loading several ships with spot flour. Yesterday, they inquired about spot and futures in the market, which triggered short covering and long buying. The market atmosphere was very active, and sentiment was particularly good. All months rose in unison, especially the current month, which was more active and popular due to spot flour. However, it was briefly suppressed by factory selling. The closing price rebounded due to hoarding and short covering. The final closing price was up two cents for the current month, one and a quarter cents for the next month, one and a half cents for June, one cent for July, and three-quarters of a cent for August. The initial opening price for September was $2.055, followed by a slight drop of a quarter of a cent. There were no transactions in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e248">The Lonely and Desolate Period Wheat <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>There was little trading in marked wheat yesterday, and all parties lacked enthusiasm. There were few transactions throughout the day, and prices did not fluctuate much. Imported wheat was quoted down by one to two jiao. Previous orders continued to arrive in Shanghai, but sentiment remained unchanged. There was little trading in June, July, and August period wheat in the upper and lower markets. The closing price remained similar to the end of last month. Spot wheat has not been traded for more than a week. Yesterday, Fuxin Huafeng handled more than 30,000 packages of wheat to various routes, with prices three to five cents lower than at the end of last month, including Sucai wheat at 3.5 yuan, Linhuai at 3.57 yuan, Xuzhou at 3.55 yuan, and Bengbu at 3.45 yuan. Secondary grades were reduced accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Late Indica Rice Shows a Slight Soft Trend <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Hubei Side Still Not Opening the Dou</p>
<p>(Shanghai South Side) Yesterday, the sources from various guilds were still scarce, only about 30 firms (over 5,000 shi). Sales in various markets were sluggish, and the situation was unusually quiet. Customer guilds, such as the Southern Guild, have already stopped, and the Northern Guild has suddenly become sluggish again. Therefore, although sellers want to make the market appear popular due to the scarcity of goods, they ultimately have no way to do so due to sluggish sales. Moreover, those who want to move prices will not do so without thinking of cutting prices first. As a result, although the market has been held up by sellers again, only six to seven hundred packages of Qingjiao, Silian, and other late indica rice were purchased. Although prices did not fluctuate much, the trend has softened. The market appetite in this street's shops is average. The prices of early japonica rice from the Chang Guild, Sutong, and Nangang remain at old levels, with little difference. The movement of Du Yangjian rice is flat, but fortunately the supply is scarce, and it is still stable. The balance of supply and demand is similar to before.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North Side) Because the customer guilds want to reduce the small accounts of the dou managers, the problem has not yet been resolved. Yesterday, the measuring of grain was still suspended. The dou managers' measuring fees have always been 24 wen per shi given by the firms, and the customer side also pays a small account of 3 cents per shi, but secretly it has been more than that when rice is expensive. Recently, the customer guilds wanted to reduce it, initially negotiating to reduce it to 2 cents per shi, but the dou managers refused. Then there was talk of increasing it to 2.5 cents. The dou managers believe that this small account of 3 cents has already been filed with the government and is no longer comparable to old malpractices. Therefore, they insist on not giving in. Seeing the firm attitude of the dou managers, the customers also expressed that they would not back down after a meeting. With both sides holding out, the rice market has been suspended.</p>

<p>Passenger Rice Still Strong... Stocks Are Also Thick</p>
<p>Yesterday, Min Guild still had a greedy appetite for guest rice. This street in Wenzhou was also inquiring. The market and sentiment are all trending upward in unison. However, two new batches of Xianggan passenger indica rice have arrived, and there are still goods on the way in the near future. Although the cargo owners want to raise prices, they are also restricted by the situation. Therefore, except for the high-grade rice, which is still insisted on a limited price, the middle and lower grades are all sold at market prices. The situation is similar to the previous market. A total of 3,793 packages of various types of rice were opened in the whole market, with Fuzhou accounting for the majority. It is estimated that there are 700 packages of Jiangxi machine-milled early and late rice, 1,264 packages of Hunan machine-milled rice, 400 packages of Shashi brown rice, 629 packages of Mingguang and Wuxi machine-milled rice, 236 packages of Wuhu machine-milled rice from Wenzhou, and 64 packages of Hunan broken rice and 500 packages of small patterned rice from this street. The prices are all similar to the previous market, but the high machine late and other types were not successfully delivered due to unsuccessful price negotiations. There are still more than 120,000 dan of rice in stock in the whole market.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Soybean Cargo Owners Have High Expectations <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market turned from weak to stable. Although the manufacturer-consumers did not move, other guilds were still able to continue buying. The supply was still not rushing, so half of the cargo owners were trying to sell at a higher price. Prices were not much different from before. It is estimated that this street handled two cars of Feihe soybeans, one car of Jincheng soybeans, one car of Nanhe soybeans, more than 200 packages of Zhangjia soybeans, and more than 200 packages of Dalian soybeans. To the interior, there were two cars of Yingzhou soybeans and one car of Feihe soybeans.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market contracted due to Dutch freight and had little trading. The trend was weak and flat again. The association divided rough sand white common goods at 19.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Half, transshipment goods 6 yuan, 6 jiao, 7 fen, both lack up and down. 8, 9 Ho Chih stable, very little in and out. Although Taikoo Sugar called 20 yuan and 3 jiao the day before yesterday, there was no transaction. Yesterday, the market still had a slight transaction at 0.25 jiao. The original prices of this factory's cotton white, such as Zhen Ji Jin Xin and Ren Ji No. 1, have not changed. The number plate only opened dozens of packages of ice flower white, priced at 19.5 yuan. The opening of Jian Ice another star is slightly open, and the price is the same as before, with little up and down. However, there is currently a shortage of large brick ice. It is heard that the number party has telegraphed the local head to urge loading. It is expected that there will be a continuation soon.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous red dates, due to the flat and direct market price, the market is still good. Now the stock is gradually thinning out, and the market outlook is quite promising. Yesterday, the trading plate such as chicken heart red was sold for seven yuan, the second for six yuan, eight jiao, and Haozhou red dates for six yuan, eight jiao.</p>

<p>(Lyon Raw Silk Price Reported to Fall Again) The Lyon raw silk market, recently due to the import of Japanese silk, various silk factories use Japanese silk and reduce supply, supply exceeds demand and Japanese silk falls and dumps, and the group silk market price gradually falls. Shanghai White Factory, Jing brand 13, 15, and each base paper opened 69 francs. Three-dance brand 65 francs (the above transactions are delivered in Lyon), each falling 1 to 1.5 francs compared to the end of last month. The contract is about 20 yuan less per pack.</p>
<p>(Yellow and White Coarse Silk Print Deterioration) Yellow and white coarse silk, in recent years, the demand for prints has been deteriorating. The British postal ship Blue Branch exported the day before yesterday, only Ke Chang and others have a total of 39 pieces of yellow and white native silk, transported to England and transshipped to India.</p>
<p>(European and American Silk Sales Benefit Difficult to Turn Around) In European and American countries, due to economic panic, silk fabric sales are sluggish, raw silk sales have been sharply reduced, and silk prices are trending lower and lower. Japanese silk is falling and dumping excessively, and importers are competing to sell their silk stocks. Shanghai's European and American villas dare not risk throwing money. In the blink of an eye, new cocoons are on the market. Chinese silk merchants are trying to sell at reduced prices, but there is no main. Yesterday, only Xinfu and other yellow silk by 13 bags, the price remains the same.</p>

<p>In recent years, the sale of woolen cloth seems to be inferior to that of ten days ago. Due to weather conditions, the actual sales of Chinese and Western clothing have not yet been fully launched. The goods purchased by buyers before have not yet been fully sold. Therefore, although in the midst of clearing up Japanese goods, the market is still not improving. Only one type of navy blue medium-thick serge sold well yesterday, and the selling price was firm. Yesterday, You's 1000 and 2000 medium-thick serge were sold at 5.4 yuan each, Dongfang 3108 was 5.2 yuan, and Yingji's top-brand Yingdigao was sold at 8.25 yuan.

<h3 id="e270">Divide and Conquer <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>A storm is brewing, and recently the Japanese warlords, in order to cope with the crisis of the coming years, are trying hard to break through the difficulties. They are advancing both with [Manchuria and Mongolia] and implementing diplomatic [total mobilization]. Under this goal, they say they are actively working with the countries concerned, understanding the domestic situation and the Japanese government's policies. They have tried to recall ambassadors from the United States, China, and France to their country to receive instructions in person. It is said that this refreshed diplomatic policy has the significance of preventing the allied countries of the Washington Conference from uniting against Japan and conducting separate negotiations to recognize the puppet regime. Therefore, it is named: [Divide and Conquer Strategy]. The principle of its implementation is based on the premise that all countries will recognize the puppet organization before 1936.</p>
<p>Divide and conquer, this is obviously a new policy in Japan, because we are now happy to have won the sympathy of the world, declaring that Japanese diplomacy has fallen into isolation. Especially by clinging to a resolution not to recognize the puppet organization and some kind of agreement, we have long been at ease, [covering our ears and ignoring the affairs of the world, shutting our doors and only reading ancient books]. It goes without saying that we have a heart that loves peace and a purpose of appeasement. But is this divide and conquer strategy of the wooden clogs friends feasible?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is both affirmative and negative. We affirm it because, in the present situation of being busy preparing for war on the eve of a major war, the anti-Japanese camp of the great powers can indeed suffer [divide and conquer] under Hirota's diplomacy. Can the great powers sit idly by and watch Japan's expansion and monopoly of the Far East? Of course not, but each has its own concerns. The British Empire, as the eldest of the production machinery, cannot compete with the rising star of the United States in negotiations. Therefore, not only in Latin America, does it have great contradictions with the United States, but its colonies around the world are also gradually developing [centrifugal force]. This aging psychology makes it want war, but also fear war. Although it is envious of Japan's seizure of Manchuria, it may be subjected to Japan's [divide and conquer] under the [reluctant maintenance of the status quo]. The United States also needs a temporary [transformation] of US-Japan relations because its naval construction plan has not been completed, and it has huge conflicts with Britain on a global scale, in order to consolidate its power in Latin America and prepare for the overall solution of the Far East issue. As for France, its economic position and military strength in the Far East are maintained by the [fair treatment] and [friendly relations] of Britain, the United States, and Japan in the Pacific, and will not make Japan's policies feel constrained. As for countries like Italy and Germany, they are even more out of reach. Therefore, in general, it is possible to realize the [divide and conquer] policy.</p>
<p>What is the negative significance then? It is that the temporary [defeat] of the countries by Japan is only to further accelerate their preparations for war. When a war to redistribute the market breaks out, I am afraid that this policy will not be able to achieve its ultimate goal. Because it is very obvious that if a Far East war occurs to compete for the market, it will naturally be to divide up this vast and resource-rich ancient country. If the conflict between the great powers is caused by the monopoly of the Manchurian and Mongolian economy, then the current [divide and conquer] magic weapon will probably not work.</p>
<p>However, the wooden clogs friends have their cleverness here. They will take on the role of the vanguard in attacking the red monster to obtain the recognition of various countries for [Manchuria and Mongolia], and also use this to make a fuss in order to achieve the goal of encroaching on North China. This is probably the reason why the situation in North China is becoming more critical when Hirota is singing loudly about rational diplomacy and [divide and conquer]. A certain evening newspaper reported that Zhang Ji, a member of the Central Committee, said: The crisis in North China is fraught with dangers, and Beiping is in danger of being lost at any moment, similar to the situation in the Northeast before [September 18th]. He believes that the day of becoming slaves is already in sight, which is the truth.</p>
<p>The Paris Qingyi Daily said, [Japan has no scruples about China, because since the North China truce in June 1933, Japan has firmly believed that a Sino-Japanese understanding will not be difficult to achieve]. I wonder if this understanding is that we are being [divided and conquered] under [total diplomatic mobilization], or if it is another matter, which remains to be seen.</p>

<h3 id="e271">Sunset over Qiantang <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Qingmu</p>
<p>In the dark night, before the east had fully revealed its fish-belly white glow, the roosters crowing in the next yard had already stretched their necks and crowed endlessly, startling me from my slumber. At that time, I was still lazily falling back into sleep, but they raised their voices even higher and warned me like a mad cry: [Traveler, wake up quickly! Have you forgotten that you only have today to stay? You haven't seen the beautiful scenery of the sunset over Qiantang from the Jianggan embankment. If you miss today's opportunity, the next time will be unpredictable! ]</p>
<p>I took the coal-eating contraption to Jianggan, and sat on the Liuhe Pagoda and looked into the distance until sunset. Ah! I'm afraid that any place with good scenery can't compare to the serenity and transcendence of this place. The continuous small mountains like blue snails on the water surface, the few returning sails at the junction of the sky and water, and the shimmering waves like the eyes of a virgin, are all enough to dispel my worldly thoughts. In this infinitely beautiful sunset, in the embrace of such great nature, I forgot all the darkness of the future.</p>
<p>The beautiful scenery of the setting sun over the Qiantang River, none of its beauty is unlike a peerless beauty. Are those few faint distant mountains that are lightly drawn, not like the beautiful eyebrows of a beauty? Are those rose-like clouds in the western sky, not like the blushing cheeks of a beauty in her beauty and shyness? Is the sound of the wind blowing on the waves, the wonderful aftersound, not also like the beauty's clear and crisp throat? The few returning sails facing the wind are like the light and graceful posture of a beauty walking. The scenery at dusk is becoming more and more beautiful. A round of red sun has already half entered the heart of the river, the surrounding mountain peaks have become vaguely indistinguishable, and the golden light flowing on the waves is like ten thousand swimming golden snakes; it is also like countless flashing shooting stars in the sky. I am afraid that even if Muse were to be reborn, she could not describe its beauty even to one ten thousandth.</p>
<p>The returning boats are dotted, rising and falling in the ripples like seagulls. The spring-hearted girls on the boat are singing their clear voices, singing and swaying the songs of free love. They are truly immortals in the mortal world. No matter morning or evening, in the midst of that green water and gentle waves, no matter how affectionate and happy they are, no one will know or interfere. It's a pity why I wasn't born here and become a fisherman, but was born in this vast world!</p>

<h3 id="e273">The True Meaning of [Nude Movement] <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>Turning, turning, the wheels of this era. Humans are [fond of novelty and tired of the old]. From nudity to covering the body with leaves, from knowing how to cover the body, they have evolved step by step, all the way to wrapping the entire body and only exposing the hands and face. It seems that [wearing clothes] is boring, long clothes become short clothes, simplicity evolves into complexity. Women even [turn over three times a season]. The clothes of a year don't know how many times they have to be turned over. The one garment that is enough is no longer applicable. [Things reach the end of the road], and enough turning has been done. So they degenerate again, and gradually some people advocate [returning to the primitive] and being naked!</p>
<p>[Naked] Those two words are so touching. The whole group takes off completely [not a single thread]. You look at me, I look at you, the whole body is exposed. Women have always considered [the mysterious breasts] and [the incredible reproductive organs]. At this moment, they are [regardless of everything] completely naked! It's good, if you really return to such a situation, [class consciousness] will be less divided. Walking on the road, no one will see her as a young lady, or her as a maid. Who can tell [XX is a rich man], or [XX is a poor man who [cannot eat his fill]]! To put it playfully, the arresting officer's baton should be more careful when it is used, lest it accidentally touch the [inviolable] noble.</p>
<p>Although that's how it's said, after there really is such a fact, the clever [supermen] will come up with other tricks. After all, status must be divided, and [mixing pearls with fish eyes] is not the end of the matter. So they turn from nudity to other tricks, and the concluding sentence, [returning to nature], is still just a bourgeois fashion!</p>
<p>If you recognize the true meaning of [returning to nature], seductive advertisements have long been despised by people. If it is really as the advertisement says, isn't it the same as spending money to see mysterious pornography? Taking [nude movement] as a novelty, taking it as an exhibition of the body. Inevitably, in this metropolis that is filled with strong eroticism, [public exposure of the body] is just a timely [stimulant]. Speculators take advantage of this opportunity to publicize it greatly, surprisingly exceeding [all content], and the audience is willing to pay a considerable price in exchange for a short period of [satisfaction of the eyes], especially the [spring-hearted] youth, after seeing the seductive advertising text, involuntarily [their hearts swaying and their spirits shaking], and are confused by the eye-catching words of [reproductive organs publicly exposed]!</p>
<p>This is what is called a reflection of a part of the true meaning of the current [nude movement]. This impression is ultimately a terrible impression, entangling the wrong target, blurring the eyes, confusing the will, and numbing everything else.</p>
<p>It is true that the wheels of the era are turning. If the words [nude propaganda] were mentioned in a Chinese film three years ago, it would have been banned long ago. But today, not only is it not banned, but it is allowed to be shown publicly. Undoubtedly, this is the wheel of the era turning forward. Some people also believe that this is turning backwards, because its name is [returning to nature]. This is another question, which will be put aside here for the time being.</p>
<p>The future is unpredictable, maybe the [nude movement] will really succeed one day. This depends on how the situation arises. I expect that even if it succeeds, it will be difficult to maintain it for long. If it loses its true meaning, it will only be harmful! Because everyone exposes [reproductive organs], [reproductive organs] will become as ordinary as the current [hands]! Seeing them with your eyes also makes it easier to take action. When a certain [sensitivity] takes effect, its bad consequences are more likely to occur!</p>
<p>The goal of [returning to nature] is currently recognized as the vanguard of [healthy body]. It also took on this title and called on others, but looking at it from the current perspective, it is simply to implement this in order to see [reproductive organs]. If that is the intention, I might as well plan a kind of clothing as follows, I think it will be much faster than the nude movement Female - A long cheongsam with a large round hole dug out at the crotch of the pants, and the buttocks should be made completely naked, as should the breasts, or made into long, square, or triangular shapes, or other exquisite patterns.</p>
<p>Male - For those in suits, cut a small hole in the crotch of the pants that can drag out the reproductive organs, and there is no need to expose the face. Those wearing long robes can imitate the female style.</p>
<h3 id="e274">On Reading <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Preface</p>
<p>The purpose of reading is, of course, different for everyone, but everyone thinks of using it as a tool to obtain a comfortable life.</p>
<p>The ancients' [ten years of cold window] was to [ascend to a high position] and today's [studying abroad] is to obtain a [doctoral degree]; although there are plenty of people who read ten thousand books and still remain a student their whole lives, and those who get a doctorate degree may not all become high officials – which is to say, they fail to achieve a "comfortable life." That is just an example of the ancient and modern [poverty and success are destined, wealth and rank are in heaven], a helpless thing, truly fate.</p>
<p>[Books] must be read, and people today generally agree that reading is the only [way out] for an individual. So, shouldn't the methods of reading be discussed?</p>
<p>In the past, the Four Books and Five Classics were required reading, the foundation of everything, and advancement depended on them. But now, times have changed, who would bother with these stale things? Although the [revivalist] gentlemen are still willing to rummage through antiques to find treasures, few people pay attention in the end. Unfortunately, apart from the fixed path from enlightenment to elementary school and middle school, beyond that, there are many forks in the road and it is hard to know what is right. Some people use [interests] and [aspirations] to determine their future, but none are as clever and brilliant as using means to obtain a [comfortable life]. If you really want to take [serving the country and benefiting the people] as your own responsibility, then you are a very, very big [fool].</p>
<p>Because China has very few [fools], those who study medicine overseas come back to delve into literature, and those who study military affairs raise the banner of politics high upon their return.</p>
<p>Does reading ultimately need guidance? Those who guide are of course the wise and perceptive, and those who are guided are of course those who are aware later, or even those who are unaware. The [guidance] mentioned here, of course, means that the wise and perceptive tell the later-aware or unaware how to live a [comfortable life] (note: there is a narrow and broad definition), which is to say, how to read and what to read. Lin Yutang strongly disapproves of reading needing guidance and is also a strong opponent of school education. His reason is that [learning and thought slowly gestate and grow, just let it take its course, and do not force it]. And especially do not [force others to read what I like to read]. Liu Zhiji being able to read the Zuo Zhuan but not the Ancient Text Book of Documents is one example. So he advocates finding and reading the articles of the ancients that are close to one's own temperament.</p>
<p>In fact, reading with guidance is not a bad thing, as long as the guidance is appropriate, so-called [guide it according to the situation]. For example, when Zhiji could not read the Ancient Text Book of Documents no matter what, wouldn't it have been a good thing if someone had guided him to read the Zuo Zhuan? Fortunately, he heard his classmates read the Zuo Zhuan and liked it, so he easily memorized it. If he had never heard anyone read the Zuo Zhuan in his life, wouldn't he have wasted an excellent talent? Therefore, especially those who are wandering on a fork in the road and have not yet developed the ability to discern, desperately need proper guidance.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yutang said in the February issue of Shen Bao Monthly that reading must have courage, vision, and perseverance. I believe that reading must also have a goal, because with the former, there is only objective criticism, and with the latter, there is a subjective understanding.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Public Servants and Entertainment Venues <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>The Dawn of the New Life Movement</p>
<p>According to reports, since Chairman Chiang initiated and implemented the New Life Movement, no soldiers have been taking rickshaws in Nanchang these days, and civil servants have disappeared from tea houses, restaurants, brothels, and entertainment venues. If this is true, then we cannot but acknowledge the success of the New Life Movement!</p>
<p>Originally, when we went to Nanjing, Zhabei, especially the interior, tea houses, restaurants, brothels, and entertainment venues, which place did not have the footprints of civil servants? Logically, civil servants should be role models for citizens, but now civil servants are the first to engage in these degenerate activities, how can citizens not imitate them?</p>
<p>Having become a civil servant, as long as you have epaulettes on your shoulders and a badge on your chest, you can ride in a car without paying, watch a play without paying, and drink tea and alcohol without paying. The so-called forced borrowing and buying is truly doing all kinds of evil and doing all kinds of bad things!</p>
<p>In our hometown's entertainment venues, whenever there is a drama or movie, the best seats are taken up by civil servants, soldiers, and police early on. The brilliance of badges and epaulettes shines in all directions. With a talisman, watching a play for free, no one dares to speak. In the theater, they also gesticulate wildly and disregard others, often causing trouble.</p>
<p>Ah! Civil servants should be role models for the people, but now... They should maintain local order, but now, not only do they not maintain order, but they also disrupt it. The so-called holding a position without performing duties, being a thief to the people, has long been obvious to everyone!</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want the Chinese people to know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, to change their usual degenerate and decadent state, and to abide by the New Life... It is truly not recognized to start with civil servants!</p>
<p>Now, because Chairman Chiang is in Nanchang, Nanchang is starting to rectify things. As a result, no soldier is taking a rickshaw again, and civil servants have completely disappeared from tea houses, restaurants, brothels, and entertainment venues. But apart from Nanchang, the military and political authorities in all other places should... Observe regulations, otherwise, what use is it to only have Nanchang?</p>

<h3 id="e276">Spring Night <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Yan</p>
<p>Pushing open the window of the small building, the breeze gently brings fragrance in. Looking out from the window, the sky is a hazy expanse, stars twinkle, and the songs coming from the courtyard stir in the quiet air. One will leisurely lean back in the writing chair, smoking a Turkish cigarette, close one's eyes, and think of all the things that one would never think of at ordinary times.</p>
<p>This is a spring night.</p>
<p>The spring breeze twirls around the loose hair of ladies and dances on the purple flower ties of gentlemen. Special spring tour buses take large groups of urban men and women to breathe the air of spring in another world. It brings a light and lively mood, and everyone is immersed in the embrace of spring.</p>
<p>Several young people came out from seeing "Cloud Garments and Dazzling Tunes" in Nanjing, and their legs lightly slid onto Avenue Joffre, stepping into the Russian cafe. Large steaks, stimulating alcohol, flirting with the waitresses with abandon, sorrow falls behind joy, enjoying this spring night that is worth a thousand gold pieces as much as possible.</p>
<p>Staggering out of the cafe, the neon lights shine on my flushed face, singing, laughing, like sailors, rickshaws gather around shouting [immediately write].</p>
<p>[When there are flowers, pluck them, don't wait until there are no flowers and break the branches in vain.] A foreign girl smiles and pays attention to us, she does not understand the meaning of the words and the reason for our laughter. My right hand approached my lips and sent a kiss, she said娇嗔a Nansehce, as moving as music. Spring, this is the season of happiness, we can only laugh, how much joy is there in life, do not fail the good spring light; have fun, this spring night.</p>
<p>Several people, shoulder to shoulder, stepping with heavy steps, marching like the military, heading west on Avenue Joffre. The Avenue Joffre at night is full of temptation, the dark green lights in the shops on both sides illuminate women's underwear, spring fashion models, young people's hearts beating wildly, and sin is probably where it begins to capture its prisoners.</p>
<p>Walking and walking again, chasing out every pedestrian, gradually the sound of trams is no longer heard. The night is deep, inevitably turning back [let's go back]. Women's underwear and spring fashion models are no longer seen in the window displays, and the music in the cafe is also lazy and not as energetic as before. The Russian woman touched our shoulders and said [Lovemetonigbt].</p>
<p>Returning, collapsing into the writing chair. Gazing at the sky in a daze, leisurely thinking of many lovely stories, she is like the spring night, fleeting and no longer traceable.</p>
<p>[...Come back, sweet dream...] The songs from the neighboring courtyard are endlessly sent by the spring breeze. Immersed in a sweet dream... Have fun, do not let down...</p>
<h3 id="e277">Scholars and Officials <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Song</p>
<p>In the imperial examination era, the government selected scholars through literature, and scholars became the superior class in society. The so-called [all professions are inferior, only studying is noble] is clear evidence of the general public's respect for scholars. Scholars received special treatment from the state. As long as they were familiar with the books of the sages and learned the skills of writing eight-legged essays, seeking official positions and ennoblement was not a difficult task, at least much easier than for ordinary commoners. Scholars were in this win-win situation, advancing to become officials, retreating to become refined people, as commoners, still remaining respected scholars. It can truly be said that scholars were people above people. Moreover, it is said that scholars have always been noble, despised the secular world, and had no interest in officialdom, which are all beautiful stories left for posterity to praise. The famous Tao Yuanming refusing to bend his waist for five pecks of rice, preferring to resign and return to the fields, is undoubtedly a typical figure representing the noble scholars of ancient times.</p>
<p>Due to the shift in the tide of the times, the scholars and officials of ancient times had a close relationship. As long as they were loyal and devoted, the emperor's grace was vast, and they would not have to worry about not having an official position to take. But coming down to today, scholars have lost their former status in the eyes of the general public, and their social status is even more filled with feelings of the past and present. Moreover, in this era of natural selection, scholars cannot survive as a leisurely class as their predecessors did. In the past, scholars would not take official positions, but now they seek official positions but cannot obtain them. As for characters like Tao Yuanming who show off their nobility, of course, there are none.</p>
<p>Some say that although there is now an Examination Yuan established to identify talent, select the wise and capable, and allow heroes to have a place to use their skills, so as not to arouse feelings of not being recognized, this cannot but be called a step for scholars to advance. However, among thousands of people, being fortunate enough to be hired is rare. Even if elected, there are few real official positions, but rather a title that has a name but no substance. A blank check, the realization of which is indefinite, and waiting on an empty stomach, there is no real benefit to speak of. Being an official or not being an official, there is no difference.</p>
<p>Scholars are full of learning and have a brilliant writing style, and it is not difficult to express upright and serious opinions, but in the end, their power is no more than talking on paper, and it does not help in practice. Because today is an era of military-national democracy, everything rigid, marching in square steps, and intellectual egg sacs are mostly eliminated. The reason why scholars cannot hold an official position is not due to the government's discrimination, but because the scholars' own strength is weak, and they are not worth anything. Writing and reciting poems, and manipulating ink, are the only true colors of scholars. Apart from this, they have no other strengths. Alas, scholars, how can they deal with themselves?</p>

<h3 id="e278">Siamese Anecdotes (6) <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>Naked Women</p>
<p>The dress of Siamese women is very simple. In the city, most of them wrap a piece of floral cloth around their lower body, and only loosely wrap a three- or four-inch wide white gauze around their breasts. Some don't even use white gauze, and their breasts are completely exposed. Those young girls occasionally wear a gauze vest, which looks to have a unique charm. As for shoes and socks, they don't need them. Even aristocratic women, when going out, only put on a pair of leather slippers on their bare feet. However, metal ornaments are indispensable for them. Even a female vendor carrying a betel nut stand must wear a gold or silver belt around her waist. Those who have more money always have one or two diamond rings on their fingers in addition to the gold belt. Speaking of places farther away from the city, it is said that most of them still live a completely naked life.</p>
<p>What needs to be added here is the diligence of Siamese women. Whether it is farming, fishing, or carrying scallions and selling vegetables, it can be said that it is the duty of women. Men stay at home to hold children and cook. Therefore, the words [At home, obey your father, when married, obey your husband, when your husband dies, obey your son] do not apply to Siamese women. Not only do they not need to rely on men, but in fact, men rely on them.</p>
<p>Rainy Season and Floods</p>
<p>The weather in Siam is truly strange. Not only is it hot like summer all year round, but it also rains at a fixed time. Starting in mid-September, there is usually a heavy rain every day at noon, and after about two hours, the sky clears after the rain. This lasts for more than a month, which is the so-called rainy season. Starting in November, it will not rain until the next September. During this rainless period, residents in places without rivers are very worried about drinking water. Therefore, during the rainy season, they store water in underground cellars for use during rainless periods. (The above describes the situation inland. In Bangkok, there is tap water, and residents will not feel this kind of pain.) Sometimes, when the water runs out, they have to use ox carts to buy it dozens of miles away, but the price is also very expensive. An ordinary kerosene tank of fresh water costs as much as four or five 角 of silver coins in China.</p>
<p>About a month after the rainy season, it is the flood season. When the water comes, it is also at noon. Clearly a street, in the blink of an eye, it will turn into a river. When returning home in the evening, the ground is very dry again. This lasts for almost three or four weeks. When the tide is high, boats can travel on the streets. Therefore, Siamese houses, even on land, must be built on wooden stakes five or six feet high, like cages, for fear of being washed away by floods. However, Siamese agriculture really benefits a lot from the floods. Because after a flood, many river mud, fish, shrimp, and other things will remain in the fields. In this way, artificial irrigation can be avoided, and the fertilizer that increases the burden on farmers can also be saved.</p>
