<p>時評</p>
<h3>弔德總統興登堡恒</h3>
<p>二三日來。外電頻傳德總統興登堡政躬違和。危在旦夕。關心中歐時局與德國前途者。聞之咸爲懸系不置。而崇拜興氏人格之偉大者。尤莫不私心竊禱其無恙。孰意噩耗傳來。此一代英豪。竟爾溘然長逝。是固今日德國之大損失。而吾人緬懷興氏過去之豐功偉績。亦不能自禁其哀悼之情也。</p>
<p>興氏人格偉大之點。卽在知有國家而不知有個人。知有國民而不知有黨派。重力行而不重言説。當歐戰爆發之時。興氏年已六十有七。按照德國軍律。軍人年過六十五歲。卽須退休。氏方息影林泉。度其優游卒歲之生活。迨一接德皇詔書。卽不辭衰老。勉赴國難。苟非有國無已。曷克臻此。其最足令人景仰不置者。卽爲一九一八年德國革命時興氏所取之態度。當時興氏手掌兵符。大權在握。若有個人野心。不難壓迫革黨。而取得最高地位。然興氏恐陷國家於分崩離析之域。故不惜接受臨時政府之命令。約束軍隊。退歸本國。迨軍隊解散完成之後。彼卽恬然歸隠。略無顧惜。觀其一進一退。不光明磊落。絶不以個人得失爲念。求諸近世。實所罕見。及至一九二五年愛白脱總統逝世。德人咸推興氏爲繼任總統。於投票之當夜。興氏猶能安然入睡。置選舉消息於不顧。其無意於名利。至爲顯然。唯一至被選總統。則又不惜以風燭殘年。出任鉅艱。毫不苟且。凡此所爲。皆足當世界人士之楷模者也。</p>
<p>唯其個人行止常以國家爲前提。故興氏獨能超越乎黨派之紛爭。屹然爲一國之中流砥柱。希世瑰寳。彼於帝政時代。忠於凱撒。蓋欲爲國家服役也。及至身爲共和國之總統。不論對於任何政黨。無不一視同仁。蓋欲民意有自由之表現。不欲有所軒輊於其間也。以故七八年來。興氏旣能與社會民主黨合作。亦能與中央黨携手。又能予國社黨以施政之機會。設其有所偏愛。烏克臻此。前年總統改選後。興氏曾告國人曰。「余非某一政黨之代表。余所欲應命者。乃全體國民之召喚耳。」誠者斯言。唯興氏足以黨之。</p>
<p>興氏之另一特色。卽爲重力行而不尙多言。其一生事業。悉由沈默寡言中造成。而佐之成功者。則爲堅强之意志。冷靜之頭腦。不爲情感所動摇。不爲環境所支配。無論領導師旅。主宰政治。惟其指揮若定。故能遊刃有餘。如前年總統改選時。希特拉等無不大事宣傳。以相競爭。而興氏竟無一言以謀當選。及至當選之日。始以寥寥數語。對國民表示其擔負復興祖國之忠誠。其意蓋欲以事實取信於民。不欲藉口舌楮墨之力。與人爭短長也。他如胸襟浩大。氣宇恢宏。嚴於律已。寛以待人。皆爲興氏之美德。德人無分老少。對於興氏無不致其敬仰之忱者。出於興氏之豐功偉績者半。出於興氏之人格偉大者亦半。據柏林電傳。德人聞興氏病危。頗多嗚咽啜泣。涕泗滂沱。苟非其感人之深。何足以臻此哉。</p>
<p>興氏爲今日德國之唯一領袖。絶無疑義。嘗聞領袖之最高條件。在於容物。吾人觀於興氏之一生。而益信焉。前年希特拉未上臺前。曾公然肆言興氏年壽已高。不久人世。將來政權。必歸諸已。觀其自負口氣。與興氏較。固不可同日而語。迨希氏一旦得權。又復慘殺異已。其手段之酷辣。在今次之六卅事變。發揮無遺。興氏雖於事變經過。不贊一詞。而其優容國社黨之苦心。則爲當世所共見。今興氏已矣。國事正亟。遽失重心。而後繼總統。尚待續選。在此暫時代任之秋。希特拉果能繼繩興氏之遺志。一改其以前面目。而與反對派謀妥恊耶。抑將變本加厲。一意孤行。陷國事於益趨危險之境地耶。當興氏易簧之前。尙與希氏作一小時之長談。意者興氏或曾致其最後之忠告。而望希氏之採納乎。希氏果能曲體斯意。豈惟興氏之幸。亦德人之幸也。</p>

<h3>希特勒由軍曹一躍而爲陸軍大元帥未徵國民同意顯與憲法牴觸總統最後遺言政府不予公布</h3>
<p>（柏林）　希特勒旣就總統職當然爲陸軍大元帥、前爲軍曹、今乃爲陸軍領袖矣、雖其就總統位、未曾得國民之同意、與憲法牴觸、但希特勒似可得全國人民與陸軍之擁護、興登堡逝世之日、適爲大戰發生二十年紀念日、興氏現年八十六歲九個月、其父逝世時亦同此年齡、可謂巧矣、紐台克别墅現仍有國防軍保護、有欲入别墅者、輒爲軍警所阻、雖新聞記者亦然、截至今日午後三時三十五分爲止、關於興登堡最後臨終情形、及其最後遺言之消息、皆未公佈、死後數分鐘内、電報與電話完全爲官塲所獨佔、而官員乘車疾駛、各處奔馳、其有重要工作、亦可顯見、（二日路透電）</p>
<h3>敎堂撞喪鐘全國停娱樂下半旗誌哀</h3>
<p>（柏林）　興登堡總統逝世消息公布後、德意志全國一致痛切哀悼、如喪考妣、國社黨各團體卽行正式服喪兩星期、内政部長佛力克亦宣布全國服喪至殯葬之後、各公署均下半旗　各敎堂規定每日上午八時至九時擊鐘誌哀、亦至殯葬後始止、公共塲所禁止奏樂、全體官員臂纒黑紗誌哀、船隻及營房亦一律下半旗、舉殯之日、一切交通停止一分鐘、各工廠則停工一句鐘、公共宴會一律禁止、興登堡總統逝世之消息於今晨九時四十五分由宣傳部長戈培爾廣播全國、宣　稱、一興登堡總統於今晨九句鐘仙逝、臨終時僅有其家屬在側、今晨九時二十分、紐台克之總統别墅首下半旗、此爲總統逝世最初之噩耗、路旁農民清晨仰見總統金旗下旗桿之半、卽肅然起立脱帽、默然俯首、其時紐台克敎堂喪鐘亦發哀音、農民於是相集成羣、以哀而敬之口吻、追述元老往事、别墅樓窗、幕帷緊懸、蓋卽總統易　處也、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　德總統興登堡今晨薨於紐台克别墅、年八十有七、按今日侵晨醫生報告德總統虚弱愈甚、已入昏迷狀况中恐不能延過今日云、今晨五時、興登堡之子媳等皆被召至病榻之側、總統逝世後、别墅卽懸半旗、時爲午前九時、新聞記者見之、卽電傳於外、</p>
<h3>總統總理職權合併外傳内閣召集</h3>
<p>緊急會議、通過將總統與總理兩職合併爲一之法律、希特勒總理乃卽抵任總統之職、此後希氏或將改稱德國元首（路透　　（柏林）　内閣通過法律規定總統與總理之職務、由希特勒總理兼領、此項法律業經公佈、内容分爲兩條、第一條稱、「兹規定總統職務與總理職務相合併、一切總統現行職權歸領袖希特勒總理行使、由渠指派代理之人、」第二條稱、「此項法律自興登堡總統下世之時起、卽實行生效」</p>
<h3>軍隊宣誓忠希特勒國防部長白隆</h3>

<h3>新頒法律違反魏馬憲法具有政治革命性質</h3>
<p>（柏林）本日内閣頒佈法律、任命希特</p>
<p>勒攝行總統職務、此種手續、原係魏馬憲法第四十八條所許可、且第五十一條　固亦規定　總統因故不能執行職務之時、儘先由總理攝行、至新總統選出時爲止、但今日内閣法律、在總統職務與希特勒總理之間、樹立一種純粹個人的關係、（卽謂總統職務由希特勒以個人資格、而非以總理資格攝行）、此則絶對具有革命性質者也、此外國防部長白隆培將軍、令海陸軍隊向希特勒個人宣誓効忠、亦一種革命性質之措置、至今晨爲止、魏馬憲法在法理上尙未宣廢止、但今日内閣所頒佈之法律、則固與魏馬憲法之字面與精神絶對相反也、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>定下週三舉行國葬</h3>
<p>紐台克　今日正式公布、故大總統興登堡訂於下星期二日在丹倫堡舉行國葬、該日上午八時全國戰艦均將鳴禮砲二十一響誌哀、丹倫堡爲興登堡指揮東綫戰事率軍大敗俄軍之重鎭、世人每以興登堡與丹倫堡之役並稱、今於其地葬之、所以紀念其戰功也、（二日國民電）</p>

<h3>文武官員服喪半月</h3>
<p>國社黨領袖已諭令黑衣隊與挺進隊及其他一切政治機關服喪半月、全國文武官員亦如是、普魯士邦若干軍隊曾以興登堡總統爲其長官者、則將服喪四星期、所有播音節目、皆於今晨九時三十五分突然停止、（二日路透電）</p>
<h3>臨終與總理作密談</h3>
<p>（柏林）　昨日總理希特勒與興登堡總統密談一小時、當時無人在側、故其内容無從證實、但信繼任總統問題必曾討論及之、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　據德意志通訊社發表消息、希特勒總理以下列電文拍致興登堡上校及其夫人、（卽總統之子及媳）略謂「昨日訪問我上將故大總統作最後一次談話、經過情形今猶在目、詎意噩耗傳來、如是之速哉、全國民族與余同深悲愴、敬獻唁忱、卽希垂察」云云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>廢皇威廉倍切痛悼社恩德廢皇</h3>
<p>威廉及其家屬接得興登堡總統噩耗、哀悼之至、此間廢皇宫内大臣宣稱、「興登堡總統噩耗傳來、吾人盡爲一驚」云、廢皇威廉卽電紐臺克之總統長子弔唁稱、「朕與后痛悉閣下及德國所遭遇之損失、五内爲之摧裂、上帝所祝佑之生命遽而云逝、皇儲將親蒞紐台克向此陽南堡之英雄、致其最後之敬禮」云云、該電下署威廉、聞廢皇太子卽將往紐台克向總統之墓恭獻花圈、（二日國民電）</p>
<h3>各國唁電雪片飛來　柏林德國</h3>
<p>人民之視興登堡總統不啻保佑德國之神靈、愛戴至深、故噩耗傳出全國震悼、各處唁電雪片寄來、法國杜邁格總理一聞噩耗、卽令國務院機要處長向德國大使古斯德弔唁、並致電希特勒表示同情、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>科威斯　英王喬治今日於遊艇中發電、向大總統興登堡公子弔唁、稱「朕聞尊父仙逝、不勝痛悼、尊父不僅爲蓋世英雄、亦爲偉大政治家、定能在德國史上永垂不朽、謹向閣下致其哀思」云云、（二日國民社電）</p>
<h3>興登堡小史</h3>
<p>系出將門　保羅方興登堡者、系出將門、少學武事、善兵法、某年德國陸軍大操、興登堡與德皇威廉第二各將　軍、作假戰、德皇所率之北軍、節節敗退、戰終評判勝負、興登堡得意忘形　遽語皇曰、「假令陛下爲敵將者、今日北軍已全入北海而伍波臣矣、」皇勃然變色、興登堡頓悔失言　不自安、因乞休以試皇、皇果許之、自是興氏遂隠居漢諾佛　而忘情於功名矣、</p>
<h3>歐戰成名</h3>
<p>一九一四年歐戰發生、俄軍大舉侵入東普魯士、連下名城、德國朝野震恐、德皇屈於衆情、卑詞電召興登堡入京、授以東境總司令之職、與登堡乃佈鉗式之陣、誘敵深入、一戰而盡復失地、是爲丹倫堡大戰、大戰之前一夕、興氏貽書其夫人、中有言曰、「余信老夫終將成名矣、」不意戲言竟成事實、經此犬捷、興氏遂獲「祖國救主」之英名、晋升上將備受國人禮遇、雖好自尊大之德皇、亦不得不致其欽仰之忱、所謂時勢造英雄、以言興氏固屬良當、然非養之有素、亦烏能僥倖成名哉、</p>
<h3>東山再起</h3>
<p>興登堡嗣擢任德國陸軍最高指揮、迨歐戰告終、興氏方以爲功業已成、從此可退休田園、樂俟天命、不出問天下事矣、乃時閲六載、國遭大故、東山再起、更建功業、彪炳軼前、興氏時已年逾古稀、古詩曰、「夕陽無限好」、大可移評興氏幕年之建樹也、</p>
<h3>初任總統</h3>
<p>先是、戰後德意志共和國第一任總統艾白特死於任、共和黨大恐、嗣聞興氏允爲候選總統、乃益惶駭、即保守黨亦然、蓋懼軍人秉政、不利於民國前途也、</p>
<h3>民心翕服</h3>
<p>乃此老將就職未久、民心翕然、保皇黨初色然喜者、兹乃怵然憂矣興氏之爲人也、備具日耳曼族剛强之美德、而復忠於職責、待人以誠、自奉殊薄、雖政見不同者亦爲感動、説者謂自鐵血宰相俾士麥以還、秉政之人受民衆愛戴、而其威望復能左右全國、無出興氏右者、誠非過論也、</p>
<h3>半生戎馬</h3>
<p>興登堡以一八四七年十月二日生於普魯士之波森城、今其地已入波蘭版圖矣、其父爲普魯士陸軍軍官三百餘年來、興氏一族之子弟、多事戎馬生涯、以軍功發跡者、代</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>有其人、興登堡少時肄業軍校、年三十二、以上慰被袭供　陸軍參謀部、</p>
<h3>兒孫繞膝</h3>
<p>於是乃娶芳齡十八之史佩玲女士爲婦、夫人賢慧出衆、伉儷良篤、生子一女二、而於一九二一年逝世、子名沃泰斯、亦置身行伍、二女皆嫁軍官、興氏之孫輩、今已婆娑繞膝矣、</p>
<h3>奇略制敵</h3>
<p>世界大戰之前、興登堡曾參加普奥戰爭及普法戰爭、丹倫堡一役之克奏奇功、蓋得益此二戰爭中所受之經騐也、丹倫堡大捷後、興氏除膺國家之殊榮外、並獲德國九大學之名譽學位、及若干大學鎭之自由、東普魯士都會柯尼斯堡以興氏驅走俄軍、使德人免受野　主義之蹂躏、而獲永不磨滅之英名、特贈以大學所有四科之博士學位、藉示尊崇、丹倫堡大捷後、閲一星期、興氏復敗俄軍於瑪佐里安湖、東　之危、至是全解、繼後數出奇略、敗俄軍於波蘭之洛特士、</p>
<h3>屢建殊功</h3>
<p>德軍屢戰輒勝、士氣大振、興登堡於是名聞各國、威振世界、一九一六年遂任德國陸軍最高指揮、總領戎重、時東陲已可高枕無憂、故得專心應付西部戰事、乃築四通八達之戰壕、建堅固絶倫之堡壘、即戰史中所謂「興登堡陣綫」是也、德軍據此以與恊約軍相周旋者、垂兩年之久、</p>
<h3>被迫休戰</h3>
<p>一九一八年十月三日、興登堡應召返柏林、又與閣議、陳述前陣眞相、其結果德國乃向恊約國提出休戰建議、當時前綫大軍達數十萬、而士心渙散、稍有疏忽、必潰决不可收拾、然興氏竟能從容不迫、撇師回國、舉以交與革命政府、以資調遣、此非老成深算者、鮮克有濟、</p>
<h3>解組歸田</h3>
<p>翌年、國事粗定、興氏乃解組歸田、度其恬靜之生活、時爲一九一九年之六月也、興氏心口如一、發言爽直、恒爲「在上者」所不喜、然對於已之責任、從不諉避、興氏嘗上書艾白特總統曰、「和約之簽字、使僕得間宣布自一九一六年八月二十九日以後、凡大本營一切决議與行動、皆僕負責、凡德皇所發關於作戰之一切布告與命令、皆從僕勸告而由僕負責出之、爰請大總統以此宣言告諸德國民衆與恊約國政府」云、讀此數言、其豪邁之氣概、從可知已、</p>
<h3>連任總統</h3>
<p>一九二五年二月、艾白特總統逝世、次月舉行初選、結果揭曉、右翼各黨乃知所推候選總統杜伊斯培氏、非中央黨社會黨民主黨所推候選總統馬克斯氏之敵、惄焉憂之、海軍大將竇比資乃獻議曰、欲期覆選獲勝、唯德國「大老」出馬、而後始可操左券焉、大老者何、即興登堡上將是也、衆韙其議、於是寳氏登程赴漢諾佛勸駕、興氏允任候選總統之消息旣播、國人相顧失色、流言蠶起、謂此乃復辟之嚆矢、縱有凡爾賽和約、不足遏止帝制之復活云、即鄰國亦爲惴惴、深慮軍人秉政、復行黷武主義、而作新戰爭之凖備、</p>
<p>投票選舉總統之一星期前、興登堡在漢諾佛延見德國與外國報界代表、剴切聲明渠息影田園、快然自得、八十老翁更復何求、今不惜再爲馮婦、以任煩劇者、唯冀對祖國聊盡責仟耳、深望渠之勉盡厥責、可爲國人之表率、從此因黨爭而内部分裂之德國、得告統一、至於外傳渠謀重整軍旅、以圖報復各節、實不足信、渠於世界戰爭中備覩種種慘象、此情此景、永縈心懷、渠半生戎馬、飽嘗難險、備戰復讐之念、未嘗一入腦海、興氏以莊嚴之態度、誠懇之言詞、披露肝胆、聆者動容、且對於其偉大之人格、油然起敬焉、</p>
<p>一九二五年四月二十六日、興登堡獲一四、六三九三九九之選票、應選爲德意志第二任總統、</p>
<h3>致力和平</h3>
<p>就職之前、有兩事足令人驚異者、即興氏請國務員美斯納博士留任、並命當時總理路德宣布渠（興氏）贊同内閣依守道威斯計畫、及内閣所議决之國際融和方案是、後此洛迦諾公約即因此國際融和方案而成立者也、</p>
<h3>恪守憲法</h3>
<p>一九二五年五月二日、　興登堡總統行就職禮、以沉重之語聲、宣誓矢忠民國、當時無論友敵、皆知新總統人格高尙、宗敎信仰極篤、其在職也、必能尊重誓詞、恪守憲法、果也、興氏居任　久、國人孺慕彌殷、共和主義不特毫未受有影響、如民衆始所慮者、即向之躊躇觀望者、今亦熱切擁護之矣、</p>
<h3>勤於爲政</h3>
<p>興登堡之就總統職也、年已七十有八、而對於職責未嘗稍懈、亦從未露有倦態、每日視事不爽昝刻、仍具軍人嚴守紀律之風度、旣至公府、由政府情報處主任以日報所載每日世界大事報告之、閲一小時、延見諸閣員與司長及公共問題之諸專家　垂詢一切、</p>
<h3>關心民瘼</h3>
<p>興氏繼復規定程序、輪流巡視各省、每至一地、輒晤其有司與民衆代表、詢問甘苦、每發演説、輒殷殷以消除黨爭、團結一致爲箴告、</p>
<h3>消弭黨爭</h3>
<p>興氏對於政事、罕加顧問偶一爲之、亦不作疾言厲色、一九二六年路德第二次内閣旣倒、各黨領袖互爭新閣人選之分配歷數星期而未决、興氏一日召諸領袖至府、力予規勸、談話也、一如家庭之歡叙閲數日、馬克斯第二次内閣即出臨於國會矣、</p>
<h3>大公無私</h3>
<p>興氏對於大節、不稍徇私、一九二六年十月、國防軍大操、廢太子之長子潛行參加、消息旣露、興氏即予追究、旣而西克將軍引咎辭職、將軍雖爲興氏所器重、然接其辭呈、即予批准、不稍猶豫、</p>
<h3>高瞻遠矚</h3>
<p>興氏所發之正式言論、往往引起國際反應、舉其犖犖大者、如贊同洛迦諾公約也、如主張德國加入國聯也、如否認世界大戰德國之爲戎首也、此項否認　乃在一九二七年九月十八日東普魯士舉行丹倫堡大戰第十三週年紀念會中所發、法國各報因是指德國在精神上仍未解除軍備、</p>
<h3>全國景仰</h3>
<p>一九二七年十月二日、爲興登堡總統八旬誕辰、全國舉行熱烈之慶祝、萬民歡騰、德人之獲民衆敬禮者、前固有之、然殆無能及此日興氏所受之隆重者、總理馬克斯對民衆所發之演詞、中有言曰、「興登堡總統之大公無私、尊重公共幸福、實足爲吾人光明之圭臬」云、此語大司代表民衆之心理、是日民衆集資馬克千萬、作爲「興登堡基金」、興氏慨撥此金、賙濟戰爭中之遭殃者、</p>
<h3>共和鞏固</h3>
<p>興登堡在任稍久、厥初擁其登壇者、漸漸背離之、而民衆與共和派各黨、則日信賴之、蓋推興氏爲候選總統之國權黨、初僅視其爲帝制再興之先導者、而不意其就職後共和基礎、轉賴其力、而臻鞏固也、一九二九年興氏與其舊日之政友因事起爭、勢成水火、但興氏卒不屈不撓而卒達其志願焉、先是、國權黨要求舉行公民投票、以圖打銷楊格之賠欵計畫、興氏以爲此種建議、其主要目的、乃在破壞外長史特萊斯曼之政策、史氏之政策、爲興氏所贊助、而史氏之才識、尤爲興氏所欽佩、故興氏乃毅然昭告國人、反對公民投票之要求、投票之前數星期、史氏攖疾逝世舉殯之日、興氏步行執紼、藉示景仰、後雖舉行投票、第須獲一千一百之贊成票、始能打銷楊格計畫、而卒以民衆愛護興氏、贊成之票短少六百萬有奇、</p>
<h3>三次當選</h3>
<p>一九三二年四月、興登堡總統復被選連任、獲一九、三五九、六四二票、與之競選者有希特勒氏、獲一三、四一七、四六○票、共産黨候選員柴爾曼氏、獲三、七○六、三八八票、</p>
<p>興登堡總統爲恪遵憲法者、其處理國政、一是守法爲原則、且以德意志國之創造者威廉皇第一爲其圭臬、其對閣員、輒稱之爲「余之國務員」此非含有閣員僅爲其工具之意、亦非欲驅使若輩如其臣僕、蓋閣員旣爲其所任命、渠殊欲視爲親信、實則興氏有所舉動、未嘗不商諸有關係之閣員焉、</p>
<h3>生平嗜好</h3>

<h3>贛行營秘書長楊永泰講演（續）</h3>
<p>新生活運動與禮義廉恥</p>
<p>（三）「禮義廉恥能否當做救國萬應靈丹，應以藥是否對症爲斷、現在中國的病情，雖是很複雜，然推究病源，確是多因爲昧禮義無廉恥所致，所以我們的主要丹方，祗有重用禮義廉恥四味藥長期照服，不可任意加减，尤不可中西雜投。」這是第三解答。我們要解答這個問題，最扼要的應把禮義廉恥的意義和作用先分晰清楚，再把中國現有的病情，詳加檢查，到底發現出來共有幾種徵象，那一種徵象是因爲昧禮義而生的，那一種徵象是因爲無廉恥而生的，彼此對照一下，就顯出他的因果關係，非常之密切而分明。</p>
<p>委員長蔣先生在他所撰的新生活運動綱要中，下禮義廉恥的定義，他説「禮」是規規矩矩的態度，「義」是正正當當的行爲，「廉」是清清白白的辨别，「恥」是切切實實的覺悟，還是很抽象的説法，他在新生活須知裏頭，就很具體的分晰，我現在把他的意義分别引伸一下，同時並把中國的病情分别檢查一下。</p>
<p>１　「何者爲禮，敬恭是主，守法循理，戒愼將事，和氣肅容，善與人處，孝親敬長，克敦倫紀。」由此看來，我們所謂「禮」，絶不是單講儀式，有許多人以爲鞠躬，叩頭，握手，作揖，就是禮，就是盡禮之能事，這是很大的錯誤。又有人以爲講古代之禮，不如講現代之法，較爲切實而有效。但是這只見到一端，不知禮的作用是積極的，法的作用還是消極的。禮爲始，法爲終。孔子論政曰··「道之以政，齊之以刑，民免而無恥。道之以德，齊之以禮，有恥且格。」可見禮的效用，是超出法的效用之上。且禮之維繫社會，係防亂於未然，法之制裁社會，乃止亂於事後。禮好像是警察，法好像是推事檢察官。例如兩個人要打架，警察就要干涉勸解，總要預防社會上有刑事的犯罪發生。假如社會各個人多能够自已警察自已，當然减少刑法的適用，在整個社會言，自然就可以形成禮義之邦，故禮全爲息爭止戾之道。現在中國到處亂七八糟，不是鬥爭喧鬧僭妄，就是粗鄙浪漫玩忽，甚至犯上作亂，無所不爲，名爲守禮之邦，而實際上缺乏就是禮。維持社會治安，不能老是用事後制裁的辦法，法的效力，有時而窮。如禮能成俗，則社會上自有一種高尙的權威。在禮的環境中，如果有人違了禮，就比犯了法還要丢醜，則必受良心上社會上無形的制裁；反之，有禮的人便爲社會所尊崇。全社會皆知守禮，則一切的亂源，自然消弭於無形。我們之所謂「禮」，拿最摩登的話來説，就是重秩序，守紀律，敬長上，肅儀容，無論持躬待人接物處事，規規矩矩，都守着必恭必敬的態度。</p>
<p>２　「何者爲義，一心濟世，厚人薄己，不爭權利，急公忘私，弗辭勞瘁，扶善除惡，以彰公理。」我們從義字的對面來看，就是利。今日中國之壤，至於不可救藥者，厥爲自私自利。各個人都以家族主義爲立塲，任何事體，都是替自已利害上打算，見利忘義。一切罪惡，都由此而生，一切公衆的事情，都辦不好，這是根本原因，所以「義」實中國現在最需要的。我們對於「義」字之解釋，如果拿摩登的話來説，所謂「一心濟世」，就是對於社會的同情心，如倡義舉，辦公益，毁家紓難，有無相通，守望相助，疾病相扶持之類。所謂「急公忘私不辭勞瘁」，就是對於國家的責任心，所謂「厚人薄己不爭權利」，就是辭讓心，也就是西哲所謂利他即利己。所謂「扶善除惡以彰公理」，就是「俠氣」如路見不平，拔刀相救之類。凡兹種種，都是是現代國民必須具備的精神，可是我國社會消沉，適得其反，最缺乏義字之美德。　　３　「何者爲廉，旣明且潔，嚴愼取予，操守有節，辨别是非，力排謬説，崇尙節約，以惜物力。」廉的意義，有三方面，一爲廉明，一爲廉潔，一爲廉儉。就廉潔説，就是一介不苟取，一介亦不苟予之謂。就廉明説，就是主持是非公道之眞，不盲從，不瞎鬧之謂。就廉儉説，就是愛惜物力，公私如一之謂。我國今日之大病爲貪與私，爲瞎鬧，貪污遍地賄賂公行，對物則予取予求，對事則無是無非，對人則無善無惡，對於政治上社會上任何一種主張，無論反對或贊成，任何一種人物，無論擁護或打倒，多半都由於自私自利心的發動，而有所偏蔽。或是因爲親疎厚薄的關係，祗憑感情衝動，以爲從違，或是妄想出路，來投機取巧，或是故意搗亂，來要挾權利。弄到完全成了一個無是非，無善惡，無公道的社會，天下那得不大亂呢？明明是貪污著名的官吏，逃脱法網，優游林下，還受許多人的恭維，明明是個人權利不顧大局祗逞意氣之爭，也還有多少人去附和。最近最著的事例，如前次陳銘樞組織人民政府，毁黨禍國，易旗改元，反叛中央。如以中央爲是，則彼爲非，國人便應擁護中央來消滅閩府。如以彼爲是，則中央爲非，國人亦儘可同情閩府來攻擊中央。可是，當中央對閩用兵之前，便有許多智識份子和重要人物，大興調停之議，以爲最好是妥恊。這種模稜兩可，淆亂黑白的主張，居然也有人提出，而社會上並不以爲大怪，這眞是奬惡釀亂，結果祗有一般國民倒霉。所以不廉明所造出之惡果，與不廉潔同，甚或過之。所謂廉儉者何？我們就官廳來説，一般職員，對於公家物品，不加愛惜，對於公欵，任意濫用，好像没有切膚之痛，甚至假公濟私者，比比皆是。就個人來説，凡是上流中流的社會，多是盡情奢侈，沉嫖賭，消耗物力，全不爲整個國民經濟打算，弄到富者日貧，而貧者亦貧。</p>
<p>４　「何者爲恥，心存羞惡，不屑卑污，尊重自處，不甘暴棄，力求進步，不圖苟存，寗死禦侮。」恥的意義有兩方面：見人爲不善，便深惡而痛絶之；覺已爲不善，便引以爲羞。合羞與惡，是之謂恥。恥的性質，如一發動機，禮義廉如一部機器，故人發於恥然後明於廉，行於義，形於禮。人而無恥，則無惡不作，無所不爲，故禮義廉恥四者之中，恥尤爲要。孔子論士曰：「行已有恥，」孟子曰：「人不可以無恥，無恥之恥無恥矣。」又曰：「恥之於人大矣，爲機變之巧者，無所用恥焉。」所以然者，人之不廉而至於悖禮犯義，其原皆生於無恥。無恥之心，又爲進步之大障礙，所謂「不恥不若人，何若人有。」不知自已之無能爲可恥，必永無求進的心，自亦永無成功之望。所以一個人頑鈍無恥，未有不敗，一個國頑鈍無恥，則未有不亡。我國自鴉片戰爭以來，迄於九一八事變，屢遭國難，依然不知振奮，依然偷息苟安，這眞是無恥之尤。</p>
<p>照上面所説，禮義廉恥的意義，已分晰清楚，中國現在的病源，亦已檢查透澈，兩下對照，禮義廉恥確是對症下藥，確是救國的萬應靈丹，並且是中國的獨步丹方。所以禮義廉恥的昌明，乃是中國固有道德的恢復。以禮義廉恥爲凖之新生活運動，乃是中國固有文化的復興運動，這是與西洋史中之文藝復興異曲而同工。我們都知道現代西洋的文明，是由工革命造成的，不知道工業革命的成功，還是物質文明的表現，這種物質文明的原動力，全賴西洋先有精神文明的革新，就全靠他先把歐洲固有歷史精神所寄之文藝，復興起來。所以我們對於禮義廉恥，不但不可因爲他不是舶來品，而稍加鄙棄。正是因爲他非舶來品，纔適合中國的國情，纔是中國歷史精神所寄。我們今日做禮義廉恥復興的工作，至少要和十八世紀歐洲人做文藝復興的工作一樣努力。</p>
<p>第三、禮義廉恥爲甚麽一定要從日常生活「食衣住行」之中表現出來，這是要從内心修養的美德，若專注重外部形式的表現，豈不是跡近淺薄易流於作僞嗎？</p>
<p>禮義廉恥的養成，無論從個人方面來講，或是從社會方面來講，絶不是單靠内心修養所能辦到的。凡是人類一種美德，就是一種好的習慣，造成這種好的習慣，本來有兩條：一從内心修養，發揚到外部來；一從外部訓練，貫輸到内部去，走的路雖不同，而可以達到目的地是一樣的。但是就兩條路比較，與其從内心修養，自不如從外部訓練，更切實有效，更容易收功。並且我們所做的以禮義廉恥爲凖則之新生活，要整個社會都運動起來，要多數人都能够實行起來，尤非走第二條路從外部訓練不可，無論那一個人或是那一個社會要想改良日常生活，都是由勉强而成習慣，由習慣而成自然，等到這個人成自然了，這就是好的道德，等到這個社會成自然了，這就是好的習俗，切人類道德都要簡易化通俗化，無所謂高深，更無所謂淺薄，祗要照樣訓練，照樣實行，自無所謂作僞，更無所謂不僞。所所謂高深淺薄之分，乃是高談道德者而非實行道德者的論調，如果禮義廉恥的道理，祗是口裏高談而不去實行，或祗呌别人行而自已不行，或是今日行而明日不行，那都不是新生活，那纔是作僞。所以委員長蔣先生在新生活運動綱要中很鄭重的説，禮義廉恥一定要從日常生活１衣食住行１中表現出來，就是這個緣故。</p>
<p>人類日常生活，從抽象方面説，本有持躬待人接物處事之分。從實際方面説，則不外衣食住行，行本是行路，但亦是行爲，則持躬待人接物處事，當然也包括在行爲之内，所以食衣住行，實兼精神物質兩方的關係，確是日常生活的總稱，人類日常生活，食衣佳行，旣不能一日中斷，則禮義廉恥，自亦不能一日離棄。不但不能離棄，並且要從食衣住行之中，隨時隨地隨事都表現出來。如果不然，就成了禮義廉恥的空談家而不是實行家，就和晋人的清談，宋儒的理學，佛門的禪定一樣。整天總是想内心修養，要明心見性，直指本初，其實是離開生活來講修養，弄到修養自修養，生活自生活，兩者之間並不能發生關係，這是不見可欲使心不動而已，那裏靠得住呢？所以晉人尙清談的結果，弄到五胡亂華，宋儒講理學的結果，弄到中國一亡於蒙古，再亡於滿清，佛門習禪定的結果，弄到印度永遠沉淪，到今不能脱離英國之覊絆。這些鏡子，我們對住照一照，實在可怕得很。所以我們要挽救國難，要復興民族，不但要恢復固有道德的禮義廉恥，而且一定要把禮義廉恥的精神，從日常生活食衣住行之中切切實實的表現出來，也就是這個原故。</p>
<p>我們要表現禮義廉恥的精神，當然不是把他的一字一句繁徵博引拘文牽義的在那裏來講解，我們祗要把禮義廉恥正確的道理，和必備的條件，弄成很簡易化通俗化，人人易知易行，家家能知能行。委員長蔣先生迭次講演詞中，他很具體的提出「整齊」，「清潔」，「簡單」，樸素」，「和諧」，「嚴肅」，「迅速」，「確實」，八個條件，作我們日常生活的凖則。這八個條件的反面，就是「凌亂，「污穢」，「繁雜，「奢侈」，「囂張」，「浪漫」，「因循」，「苟且」，合乎八個正個條件而不陷於八個反面條件者，就是循禮行義。違反八個正面條件而陷於八個反面條件者，就是悖禮犯義。那種生活合乎八個正面條件，那種生活陷於八個反面條件，都有清清楚楚的辦别而知所從違者，便是廉。自已的生活，如違反八個正面條件，竟陷於八個反面條件時，則深以爲可羞，他人的生活，如違反八個正面條件，竟陷於八個反面條件時，則深惡而痛絶，確有切切實實的覺悟，而能斷然去取者，便是恥。這就是把禮義廉恥表現於日常生活的方法，也就可見日常生活確有表現出禮義廉恥的可能。</p>
<p>要而言之，我們所要昌明的禮義廉恥，不是講的，是要做的，不是偶然做的，是時時刻刻都要做的，不是少數人做的，是靠多數人做的，那末禮義廉心的意義，唯恐説得太高深，實以愈淺薄而愈適合，祗要是大家都依住這個淺薄的道理切實去做，還怕他流於作僞嗎？</p>
<p>以上三個疑問，我個人研究的結果，都已一一分别解答了。除此而外，各方面提出討論而比較重要才，本來還有兩個，其一，主説拯救中國復興民族應以輸入現代科學的智識技能爲尤重要，今提倡禮義廉恥，未免緩其所急，急其所緩了。又有一説謂中國國民生活太低，飢寒交迫，所需要者乃是求生運動而非新生活運動，還够得上高談禮義廉恥嗎？這兩個疑問，都有詳加解答之必要，但在蔣先生所撰的新生活運動綱要中，對於這兩種之懷疑論者，已辭而闢之，説得很透澈，這就用不着兄弟再爲複述了。（完）</p>

<h3>購買英商船</h3>
<p>該公司决定添開滬甬班輪後、便進行購買輪船、須客位優美、艙室較多、速度捷快、行駛平穏者、方得合用、會英商怡和洋行之長江船聯和號、有出售之意、三北得訊、卽往接洽購買、該輪與招商局之建國輪爲姊妹船、總噸爲二千七百七十噸、長二百七十八尺二英寸闊四十三尺、有甲板三層、每小時可行十海哩七五頭二三等及統艙俱全、係一九零五年在法國建造、船身極佳、以之行駛寗波最爲相宜、刻已雙方談妥、聞船價爲十八萬元、三北已經付欵一部矣、</p>
<h3>籌備各手續</h3>
<p>三北對於該新寗波班輪、舉凡旅客乘搭之一切設備招待、厲行革新、船内需用茶房、統用有訓練之人、且額定一百人、不准超過、僱用茶房、酌收證金、以資保證而昭愼重、至接管該輪後、船内各級艙位、統須重加修建、於頭等室尤求考究、邇日該公司於各項手續、已在着手積極籌備、聯和輪現尙未曾交船、三北俟接收該輪、便須派班行駛、此後滬甬一路之行駛船舶、連同達興之鴻興輪、將有六船往來矣、</p>

<h3>怎樣看電影（續）</h3>
<p>三·五光十色的中國電影界</p>
<p>在中國·雖然電影事業的發展還是最近的事，但歐美電影所經歷的過程，却繞繞經歷過。不同的，是中國電影只是歐美電影的尾巴；歐美電影，曾積極地盡了消毁封建社會意識的任務，中國電影却仍不失爲封建社會的代言人，歐美電影的發達有一定的程序，而中國電影却是毫無秩序，無組織的生産，從火燒紅蓮寺以至漁光曲，可在同一時期看到。</p>
<p>這樣，形成了目前中國電影界的五光十色。（未完）</p>
<p>春秋</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>穿過了一道隔板，這一道隔板雖然是很薄的，但它的質料却同樣是用的柚木，而且是彫鑿得十分的精緻。外面便有一間較大的屋子，這就是所謂「列車上的小朝廷」了。如其只論它的面積的大小，那當然是没有什麽可以值得説的，但就它的佈置和裝璜來講，却眞是奢華富麗到了極點。我可以先來總括的説一句：爲着要求美觀，爲着要求舒服，爲着要使它能够盡量的供給我們搬演一切朝儀，無論化多少錢，都是决不計較的！</p>
<p>第一件可以令人注意的東西是四瓶鮮花，它們分着四角，安放在這一座小朝廷的四隅。各有一座很精緻高大的木架子給襯托着。瓶的本身，當然也是價值很大的古董，彩紋和式樣，俱極古色古香之美。瓶裏所供的是四種不同的鮮花：第一種是牡丹，牡丹又名富貴花，在中國有花后之稱，太后對於它，也許是因爲彼此的地位有些相類的緣故，所以是特别的愛好。第二種是天竹，天竹可算得是東方特有的一種植物，綠的葉，配着一顆顆紅的像珊瑚似的子，實在是好看極了。第三種是迎春花，它的顔色黄得像金子一樣，恰好可以代表帝皇家所樂用的一種特殊的色彩。第四種是梨花，全部白色，略帶一些綠，很有幾分清氣。這四種花都是春季所常有的，不過我們之所以要用來點綴這一座小朝廷的原意，却不僅因爲它們是春季的花，而因它們都有一種耐久的生存力，雖然揷在那蓄水不多的花瓶裏，也不致枯萎；而且它們還能仗着這一些濁水的滋養，不斷的長葉子，長蓓蕾，一直到開花。（九七）</p>
<h3>蘭谿的女招待</h3>
<p>— 珍</p>
<p>女招待，那是三個多麽動人的字音呢！</p>
<p>雪白的蛋臉，血紅的嘴唇，彎長的秀眉，靈活的秋波，這正是幅女招待的縮影。每天，每一個時辰，總有成羣的青年，在伊們的秋波下沉醉，伊們血紅的嘴唇下顚倒。</p>
<p>然而在我們蘭谿的女招待，却略有些不同，而且亦没有什麽神秘的咖啡館，有的只是一些茶店。每一家茶店裏就有十幾隻茶桌，那些所謂女招待亦就在這裏面了。</p>
<p>所以女招待也就是實際上的女堂倌，他們雖然年齡亦都在青春，都是二十多歲的少女。然而不同的，他們却没有綾綢的長旗袍，更没有巴黎的寇丹，巴黎的香水，没有一點摩登姑娘的裝束。大都是短衣服，不過要靠伊們的手段，以及他們天生的臉兒，因此或者門庭若市，或者冷落車馬稀，這一點却又是相同的了。</p>
<p>伊們要拉夫，而且善會拉夫，伊們會把門口經過的人都拉進來。那茶店内除了喝茶之外，還有盛在碟子裏的瓜子吃，碟子是淺淺的，那瓜子的堆法是十分藝術化，瓜子剛巧遮蓋碟底爲止，一粒不多，一粒不少，茶客只吃了幾粒瓜子，一碟就完了。但第二碟又馬上送上來了，這様少的瓜子，當然吃得很快，茶店便利用這樣賣錢，一次喝茶，單是瓜子錢就很可觀。至於客人這時候，可以隨意與那些姑娘們尋開心，動手脚，這一點也是同都市裏相同的。所以許多茶客反願意選擇清淡些的店内去，茶客少，招待當然殷勤些，而這些醉翁之意不在酒的朋友們，當然滿意了。據説這小小的蘭谿市，日夜在這種茶店内沉溺着的老老少少，平均有數百之數呢。</p>
<h3>在窗口</h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>我扶着病弱的身軀，輕摇着蒲扇，依舊立在快要别去的這個所在的窗口。</p>
<p>猛抬頭，眺望着隔開數丈馬路的「望衡對宇」的人家，遠遠的一排排幾個窗口，洞開；淡綠色的燈光，映出濃綠色的房間，好不柔媚動人；馬路上，半天過來一部汽車，打斷了「嘁哩喳啦」的行人聲音；依舊是那麽一個有閒階級的年青女人，乳白色的上衣襯出伊那一點黑的頭；躱在半掩蔽的街燈的窗格子背影裏。</p>
<p>驀地聽見清脆的聲音，嬌嗔着；原來是那女人向窗下的年約七八歲的雛妓打岔兒；玩；接着連續擲下三個銅板，板板！……板板！……板板！……」</p>
<p>那跌在火坑裏的幼稚的苗兒——「墮溷花」，小小女孩兒隨着拾起銅板的老鴇，昏天黑地走了。那有閒階級的年青女人，乳白色的上衣襯出的那一點黑的頭，越爬越低，越低越彎；大概是隨着那小小雛妓的後影牽長伊的視綫；或許是在好奇，或許是在惋惜！——不，看伊那麽靜如一個畫中人的模樣，顯然是在同情。</p>
<p>我，拖着病弱的身軀，躺在沙發上，心頭波着問號，又想：「哦！這平凡的女人，只那麽板板！板板！板板！」六聲三個銅板的同情；不知道擔當婦女運動領袖的「女偉人」也着的同情，又是怎麽樣？」</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三十二回　聲色自娱將軍終日樂老少環泣戰士幾人回</p>
<p>兩個人對哭了一陣子，也就見趙翁扳住了面孔，氣怱怱的走了回來，手上拿着手巾包，向桌面上一扳道，這年頭兒眞没有公道！打仗，守前綫，是那當營長連長的事，享福，是他們軍長師長的事。别説東三省，中國，早就該亡啦，桂枝料着這撅老頭子是碰了釘子，忍住了眼涙向前，從容着問道，没見着嗎？趙翁道：果然要是没有見着，那算我走了運了。你猜怎麽着，我去的時候，正趕他和姨太太兩個人在吃點心，那樓房裏熱汽管子眞熱，我穿着皮袍子大汗直淋，他兩公子都穿的是單夾衣服，笑嘻嘻的在那裏吃着大罐子小碟子，堆了滿桌子，幾個年紀輕打扮漂亮的老媽子，在旁邊站着伺候，我心裏立刻就想着，都是軍人，爲什麽有的這樣在家裏享福，有的就該在冰地雪地裏打仗。只憑這一點，我就生氣的了。他見了我，腦袋也不動一動，眼睛裏好像没有我這一個人，我到了那裏，没法，深深的給他作了三個揖，他才望着，説老頭兒，你不是打聽你兒子的消息來了嗎？我説是的，師長可知道他現在怎麽樣？你精怎麽着？他訴了這話，没説什麽，先打個哈哈，才説，出兵打仗，一個連長的存亡，在後方那會知道得清楚呢？這個你也不必掛心，萬一你兒子犧牲了，我們姨太太還缺少一個懂事的人伺候他，你就把兒媳婦送到我這裏來罷。我看他那臉上帶了不正經的樣子，我實在也不願再和他説什麽。再説咱們家雖窮，也不至於就到他家去討碗飯吃。我勉强着問他道了謝就出來了。（四四八）</p>
<p>工人説，把這些小枝截下來，馬路的兩旁就已經很像个樣子了。</p>
<h3>老張的哲學</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>老張，是某某鎭上的一個小學敎師他處世藝術，十分高妙，所以大家都認爲他是一個研究人生哲學的人。老張很喜歡女人，可是，寫不來情書，於是他每次接到情書的時候，便偷偷摸摸的把「情書一束」上的論調，抄了幾段，再付郵寄去，於是一般女朋友們，便認爲他學貫中西，才富四海，個個樂與之交，這是他對待女人的哲學。</p>
<p>老張對於敎育，是没有什麽高深的研究，可是，他很歡喜發表敎育論文，他不惜巨資，請人代作，做好之後，署上老張的大名，寄到討論敎育問題的雜誌上去發表，這樣，老張便是一個敎育家，誰人不知，那個不曉，飯碗更加來得牢靠了，這是老張維持位置的哲學。老張對待朋友，也有好幾等分别，有地位的朋友，他終是請他吃美麗牌香烟，普通的請他吃金鼠牌香烟，起碼的朋友，對不起，要請他一個銅板的一枝的香烟了，所以他口袋裏終有三種香烟，分别藏着，看見來者何人，便請那種香烟，這是他對待朋的哲學。</p>
<p>老張的哲學，十分高妙，限於篇幅，不能盡述。</p>
<h3>後湖的鯽魚</h3>
<p>— （人偉）</p>
<p>後湖就是首都的玄武湖，们置在玄武門（即豐潤門）外，週圍面積約四十里，每當陽春時節，一枝枝的垂柳，隨風飄蕩，似乎在那兒同湖水擁吻，一朶朶的杏花，向着路人微笑。</p>
<p>有了這樣美麗的風景，已够我們留連的了；但還有鮮嫩甘美的雪藕，細糯粒大的芡實，眞是遊客們唯一的恩物！</p>
<p>最著名的，是一種肥美的鯽魚，因爲那兒的水波澄清，又有鮮美的雪藕鮮菱爲餌，可以鮑食終日，肉味自然肥美，所以它能同松江之鱸，焦山之鰣，鼎足而立，眞不愧爲魚類中的大王。</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>我對於求雨的感想（下）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>致對於「火燭小心」方能减少災害。如其不然，人家所僱的傭工，心裏只在怨天尤人；而做主人的，心裏只在娱樂游戲，一切都不留心注意；那末，星火燎原，在所不免！這種火災，豈不是人召的嗎？至於刀兵，更不必説，大都只爲了一個人，因而苦了百姓；就是成湯的大旱雲霓之望，也是由於夏桀的民衆感召而來，何嘗是天降大任於是人呢？説到這裏，我就敢下一句斷語：現在的雨，也就是由於萬衆一心所感召而來，决不是個偶然，我家的女傭，他不是張天師，原不過聽了老農的古話來説説罷了，然而張天師還不及一個老農；否則六月六已經有雨，應該有十八天的陣頭，老農已有世世相傳的經騐之談，何必再要設壇作法，他的設壇作法，上天表，發符，念咒，搯訣，步罡，也不過是村長閭長請求官府斷屠一樣，都只爲了吃飯問題；大家都爲了吃飯問題，衆心歸於一致，正如無綫電的指針，專對了一門，當然收到你一家門的人衆所願聽的一種播音，這就是個很明顯的比喻。由此可知心志歸一，任何事物，也都可以達到目的，那末「人力回天」「天從人願」，也是當然應有的可能性，並不是個迷信，仍不外乎哲學的唯心學耳。「人心唯危道心惟微」，凡人到了危難的時候，只要些微引導一下，當然猶水就下，所以我很想把求雨的功勞，歸到萬衆一心上去，使得任何危難，都用這個萬衆一心來解决他，挽回他，這個効力眞可以要風得風，要雨得雨，堯傳於舜，舜傳於禹的治法，就用這一種不二法門，樂得來利用一下，喊起個人力回天，天從人願的口號來，博個萬衆一心的趨向。我是向來主張「心電」的，我的比喻，也很淺近，比如説一個青年，心裏想慕一個某女士，起初原不過是個單相思，及至心電起了感應的作用，往往會得成了眷屬，這是常有的事，還有一種比方，前面走的人，你若想他回過頭來，他眞會得回過來的；小孩子想吃大人手中的東西，口裏不敢説，只在心裏想着，居然也會得到一些來吃，雖然是臉上有着表現，但這表現，仍是内心所發的呢：還有門的遠客，盼望家信，居然會有信來；久客思家，居然會形諸夢寐。若使對方的心電，和你對個正着，當然和電話一樣，可以千里談心。只不過我的個人理想，尙未得到實行的同志，下功夫去造成他的心電。如果造成了，一定可以和無綫電一樣，不用接綫，只消對凖了週波率，就可收到我的心電播音。我想，一定有一日會得實現成功的呢！</p>

<h3>大衆語與大衆意識</h3>
<p>— 伍實</p>
<p>要想用一兩句話來講明什麽是什麽，本來是一樁難事。所以關於大衆語的問題討論了這許多，仍舊還有像馮執中先生那樣的人提出來問：「大衆語究竟是甚麽東西？」（見七月二十七日「大美晚報」。」那是難怪的。</p>
<p>起初説：「大衆語是代表大衆意識的語言。」修正説：「大衆語是代表前進大衆意識的語言。」我更説得寛泛些：「凡不是代表特殊的羣的特殊意識的語言，就是大衆語。」但是有些人仍舊不懂，就不懂在「意識」兩個字上。甚至有些神經過敏的朋友，還説這兩個字含有危險性，那眞是笑話。看光景，大概非用實例是説不明白的了，現在就從馮先生那篇文裏摘幾句話來試試看：</p>
<p>當蔡孑民長北大時，不佞亦適在北京幾所大學濫方言敎員，故略知其詳。自康有爲，張勳先後成爲文武聖人後，許多有聖人慾的人們，都想嘗試聖人的滋味，有甚於今日電影明星之欲過皇后癮。自適之嘗試提倡新白話文而成白話聖人後，遂有若干北大敎授都想去做開山祖師。張競生本來是一個很老實的人，乃搖身一變而成爲雙料聖人。周作人亦另開碼頭，去幹他的直譯祖師了。</p>
<p>這裏有個人名，「康有爲」，「張勳」兩個不在話下，其餘四個却有講究在裏面。「蔡孑民」稱字不稱名，照習慣是尊重的意思。「適之」稱字不稱姓，其意等於「我的朋友胡適之」。「張競生」跟「周作人」都老實不客氣的直呼其名，那就分明是瞧不起他們的意思了。這樣，單單幾個名字的稱呼上，就已顯然流露出馮先生的意識來。得方程式如下：</p>
<p>尊重蔡孑民＋拉適之做朋友＋瞧不起張竸生跟周作人＝馮執中的意識</p>
<p>我們認爲這種的意識就是「特殊的羣的意識」，因若照「大衆的意識」，每個人都是大衆的一員，要稱名一律稱名，要稱字一律稱字，不應該有等差分别。所以若把My　Wife譯做「賤内」或「拙荆」，My　Son譯做「豚兒」或「犬子」，白話原也是白話，却不是大衆語。故除開意識上的差别，大衆語跟白話本來没有分别。</p>
<h3>鄉音</h3>
<p>— 薰宇</p>
<p>昨天特意去會正好二十年不曾見面的一個朋友。路上預期着不少的娛快，幼年時的朋友相見，談些往日的玩皮事，實施一次心理的返老還童，當然大可欣慰一番。</p>
<p>然而，人事，誰都料不定這末可怕，年事過去，不但生理的返老返童不可能，心理的也一样不可能。</p>
<p>幼年同學，物故的將近五分之一，還活着的，十之八九困頓於生活奔忙中。追溯往事，徒增哀感，於是我這樣地結束：</p>
<p>——近年很想回去一次，想着會見一些幼年時的朋友總能快意幾天，這樣看來，全是幻想，不回去更好。</p>
<p>朋友們的死亡困頓，不能全歸咎於個人的無能，大半是政治環境造成。貴州的政情，在外面，除了時戰時和並且不知爲什麽戰，旣戰又怎樣能和的消息外，一點也不能呌人得知的。</p>
<p>——近年，貴州的歲入，有多少？</p>
<p>——九百來往萬。</p>
<p>——倒也可以勉强支持過去了。</p>
<p>——不過，十分之八九是從黑貨來的。</p>
<p>——吸的人，當然不在少數。</p>
<p>——青年特别多，中國將來的命運，握在青年手裏，而他們吸鴉片比中年人還起勁。</p>
<p>用經濟的原因來解釋，這現象似乎是必然的。中年人身受着經濟的壓迫，幾乎氣都喘不過來；就有心吸鴉片，也無力量，時間或不致沾染吧！一個科長，月薪不到百元，還要拖欠，打折，日常生活，尙且不易支持，何况其他。青年人寄生在父兄身上，吸父兄的血和汗，而不須自已滴汗流血，在没有舞女可抱，戲院可進的貴州，一榻横陳，吞雲吐霧，豈非唯一出路。</p>
<p>這算是小資産以上階級所反映出的貴州政治，現象。若從無産階級反映出來，那當然另有風味。</p>
<p>一個鄉下人爲了繳不出六元的派捐，曾三次被捉到警署去。小百姓不能遵照法令，如期繳納捐税，顯然是違法，天理良心，該當受懲誡。納税和服從法令都是人民的義務，至於納得出納不出，誰知道。而况小百姓一經威嚇賣子押妻終不是一籌莫展的呢，警署早悉民隠，所以出於押繳一途，押而不能繳不得不放，這是事實的無可如何，放而仍不繳，不得不再押，這是法令的森嚴，也是事實的無可如何：一則一經寛放，大衆效尤，尙復成何事體；二則六元捐欵終須有着落。因此乃有第三次的押和第三次的放。鄉下人不能一日不種地，被押總是苦了，而捐欵再無法繳納，第四次，第五次，以至於不知若干次的押放總跟着上來的，這却令鄉下人不得不着急。人窮智生，鄉下人果然找到了一條出路，－身懷利刃，擱路行刦。</p>
<p>天不絶人，果然一個單身旅客，背着包裹欵欵而來，旅客見到了明晃晃的刀，來勢兇猛，嚇得三魂出竅，只得將包裹雙手奉上，鄉下人傾囊一數，大出意外，居然有九十餘元，然而他頗能知足，留下六元，其餘一介不取，隨即到警署呈繳捐欵，了却一樁公案，不料事有凑巧，兩脚還不曾踏出公門，報路刦的客人已到了，仇人相見，分外眼明，當塲指證，人贓兩在，還有什麽話可説。</p>
<p>於法，無疑地，搶刦，槍斃。然而執法的，終究只是人，不是閻羅王，前因後果，早在洞鑒之中，這倒成了一個大大的難題，只得詳叙經過，請示上峯。不幸，上峯，一樣地只是人，人間事，有許多是人力所不能解决的，這樁案件下文如何，便不得而知了。</p>
<p>不過，下文只是下文，事實，知道這許多已儘够。</p>
<p>這段事實，倘若我有文學的素養，一定可以將牠寫成小説或戲劇，暗示出貴州政治的已走到了山窮水盡。</p>
<h3>生活像一條皮鞭</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>生活像一條皮鞭，</p>
<p>一條皮鞭聚抽着我！</p>
<p>從農村到都市，</p>
<p>從工廠到鑛廠，</p>
<p>飢寒老是頑皮地和我糾纒。</p>
<p>生活像一條皮鞭，</p>
<p>一條皮鞭緊抽着我！</p>
<p>勞苦吞蝕了我的血肉，</p>
<p>剩下在我軀殻内的</p>
<p>只有幾根光骨頭。</p>
<p>我，一個年青青的小伙子</p>
<p>看來年紀就有這末三十十。</p>
<p>從農村到都市，</p>
<p>從工廠到鑛廠，</p>
<p>生活老是像一條皮鞭！</p>
<p>火辣辣地捕在我的身上！</p>
<h3>黄金時代</h3>
<h3>晒臺上（散曲）</h3>
<p>— 蒲風</p>
<p>上海心聲之一</p>
<p>説是六十年來僅見的熱度，亭子間裏的溫度最高達到了九十九度，晚上也常是九十多。白天，一進房門就有毒瓦斯一般的氣味被感覺到；入晚，雖然熱度是降低了，總也没有勇氣停留在蒸籠裏，更談不上在蒸籠裏睡。</p>
<p>天啊，誰知道晒台會是我的好宿舍哩！</p>
<p>不能忘記的，太陽一落就必得潑水。自然，潑得愈多愈好，除了儍子那有會担心晒台成澤國的呢？爲此，好幾次引起對面房子裏的小孩的，不經意的笑；驚奇中又帶了一點稚態。</p>
<p>不用説，最先必須在外面兜圈子，散散步，回來，晒台上的水才十九是乾了。那時凉風不住的吹來，迎頭就給你以愉快。而在椅子擺好後，同住的朋友便都前來團聚，於是，談笑陸陸續續地向外播送。</p>
<p>十點，十點半，凉爽使我們感到睡意。帆布床馬上就舖張出來；上面，加上一張薄的毯子，用以阻露。晒衣服的鐵絲和竹竿正便利了我不少關於安置上去的事體。</p>
<p>朋友們走進前樓去睡了。我的餐風露宿的生活也就開了始。</p>
<p>躺下去，讓星星在幕外對我笑，眨着眼，儘管注視着北斗七星，我曉得牠們比入晚時分已低落了一些。至若長庚星呢，看不見，大概是高掛在正中了吧！</p>
<p>好容易，我想起了小時候時常唱的歌謡。</p>
<p>七姑星，七姊妹，</p>
<p>打開園門摘芥菜：</p>
<p>摘一皮，留一皮，</p>
<p>長個拿來煮，</p>
<p>短個留來，嫁滿姨。</p>
<p>可是，我探出頭來極力搜求七姑星時，我得到的是失望。失望，失望，生活把我的眼睛弄壞了：不戴眼鏡再也看不到七姑星的眞象了哩——心底頓現一些惆悵！</p>
<p>自然，幼小時候的一切，很快的我又重新記起，似乎每一件平凡的事體，也都非常可貴。但是，再後一些時日，現今的生活可又不是會成爲極值得懷憶憧憬的麽？假如「生」眞的要有波浪，「生」不是平庸，人不是「生」的奴隷呵？去罷，一些不必要的過去的惆悵！</p>
<p>洶湧澎湃的心懷，突的平靜了下去；跟着睡神便來獻媚，偷的把我抱在懷裏。如果不是夜裏的月亮會把我片刻的撩醒，我是一直睡到早上，太陽光使我感到熱意時，才又翻身爬將起來的哩！</p>
<p>離開了晒台，自然，接着便是開始生活的歌唱，歌唱「生」的歌唱喲！</p>
<h3>月琴</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>——鑛山通訊之四——</p>
<p>勞苦的工作，隨着無窮盡的日子，不斷的下去。……</p>
<p>人們永遠是這末辛苦的忙碌着。——</p>
<p>從鑛洞裏揹出來的鑛砂，山一般的堆在鑛洞旁。「做草皮活的」一挑一挑的將牠挑了倒在草皮上，檢出了鵝卵石大的那些「頭子鑛」（一），用磨或舂研碎後，由「揉粃子的」冲洗去了混雜在裏頭的砂土，純粹的鑛便提煉出來了。</p>
<p>提煉出來後的　鑛，多由馬馱到箇舊去。因爲那裏是「鑪房」（二）的所在地呵。大老板（即鍋頭）（三）常住在那裏主宰着一切。鑪房裏設備着的，主要的便是一盤大碾子和容得下幾百斤煤炭的大火爐。從廠上馱下的鑛砂，再經碾子碾過後，使牠變成了麵粉一般的細微，然後才放到熱度極高的火爐裏去溶化！</p>
<p>火爐，那是全靠着風箱送進氣去，才會把鑛熔化的。所以在「扯大爐」時，專管風箱的人，便有這麽年富力强的三四個，拉着那笨重的風箱，每人只能用勁的啌啌地扯兩下，便要趕快交給站在身旁等候着的人，又去啌啌地扯兩下——。因爲這是非常吃力的喲。</p>
<p>錫鑛，經過這樣的煆煉後，便變成白皚皚的耀人眼目的「大錫」了。表面上呈現着各種不同的花紋，有的是竹葉花，有的是牡丹花……以有花紋的爲好，並且價值越貴！</p>
<p>大錫煉出來後，便可以運往香港賣去了；但也有就在箇舊賣給「廣帮」（四），由「廣帮」再運到香港去賣的。——這樣成千成萬的錢便會輕易的弄到我們老板的手裏。</p>
<p>我們的老板發了財，笑迷迷的，一面把錢匯到家裏去買田地，蓋着堂皇的房子，一面再打發人到鄉裏去招破産的的農民來加緊工作。……</p>
<h3>我來自東（十三）</h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>在這一個小小的異族混處的社會裏，你可以看見世界的一個縮影，裏面有階級的分别，種族的不同。你把機器間裏面的中國工人和跳舞廳裏面的客人相比較，你把帳房間裏面的英國人臉孔和擦地板的廣東人臉孔相比較，你把那掛白領穿黑袍的天主敎師和游泳池上袒胸露臂的美國姑娘相比較，你把那酸溜溜的蘇格蘭人和目裝闊绰的紐約人相比較，你把那下流氣十足的菲列賓學生的滑頭滑腦的日本學生相比較，你把那大肚子大屁股的美國女傳敎士和手如乾柴滿面烟容的廣東婦人相比較，你把那赤着雙足，　得難受的華橋的小孩子和錦衣玉食的頭等艙裏富豪的嬰兒相比較，你便可以在這一隻船上面發現了整個世界和全部人生。</p>
<p>在船上寫了一篇文章，看些新書和雜誌，再寫了幾封信，其餘的時間，大部分費在甲板上。在吸烟室裏有幾位美國人日本人瑞士人，時常和我討論着遠東問題。日本人之中，有一個名呌松方武的，大概是東京方面派他到美國去宣傳才回來的。説話非常滑頭。一方面自已説日本的滿洲政策不對，一方面又説東京對於美國及世界各國已表示親善的態度。他説些諂媚美國和敷衍中國的話。有時，我穿破他假仁假義的態度，弄得他面紅耳赤；有的時候，他舉出中國的劣點來，也很使我費辭解答。那瑞士人因爲是神户某洋行做事的，拼命幫着日本人説話，倒是美國人比較頭腦清楚，對於日本人肉麻的話頭，置之一笑。幾次辯論以後，那瑞士人也自知錯誤，很謙遜的問我關於遠東問題的書籍雜誌，面自已承認對於當代的重要問題，因時間不足，太不注意。</p>
<p>（更正）六月二十七日吕紹光先生「故鄉）詩第三行「我迫我」係「又迫我」之誤；三十日徐訏先生」田野間詩「去年春蠶的」係「去年春蠶的」之誤，承王欲先生來函質詢，—</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「四知堂式」駡人藝術</h3>
<p>— 阿龍</p>
<p>駡人，天然要藝術，駡人而没有藝術，猶如村婦駡街，白相人駡山門，本談不到所謂藝術。</p>
<p>「倉那娘，」「丢那媽，」這種「大衆化」的駡人，究屬非藝術的，對方聽了，一定要癩痢頭鬼火冒，弄得不好，勢必如本埠新聞中時常看到的「始而口角，繼而用武」的一套把戲，結果大皆跌進房裏去，判以兩造均屬無賴的罪名。這樣一來，豈不是大殺風景麽？故駡人的藝術的確不可缺少，約略計之，可分三種；</p>
<p>第一種，是指名指姓，列舉罪狀，痛駡一番。這種駡法，雖是「非藝術」的，然而到底是駡人，到底還像煞價事的列舉對方罪狀；無論其罪狀之是否成立，可以不問，但這種駡法，猶如紅樓夢中的焦大駡人，同一口吻，究竟有傷大雅，此駡人之最戇大者也。</p>
<p>第二種，並不指名指姓，僅對準某人的事實或文字，下以總攻擊，不問其事實和文字，是對的，或不對的，我必定要强詞奪理，駡個痛快，此種駡人，雖比較隱晦一些，因並未請來將通下名來，但傍人見了，早知道對某事某文而發，此種駡人，較爲藝術一些，但總不大十分高明。</p>
<p>第三種，駡人方法，更爲奇妙了，他的駡人，並不指定某事某文，只要將某人的一事，而其事不必爲世人所共知者。或某文中的一句，而某句又並不是大家所傳誦者，而駡人者只將其中内幕，把筆尖兒輕輕帶過，而對方已覺驚心動魄，坐立不安，此駡人之最摩登者也。</p>
<p>三種駡人藝術，各有巧妙不同，但前兩種駡人，被駡者何人，所駡者何事，當爲世人所共曉，而最後一種駡人，眞是神不知鬼不覺，祗有被駡者本人得知。倘呌傍人看來，一點看不出駡人的氣味，就是曉得他在駡人，但亦不會知道所駡何人，駡的何事，這種駡人，只有天知地知你知我知，像楊府大門燈上貼出的四知堂，就是他們駡人的藝術了。</p>
<p>駡人，天然要毁壞的名譽，排斥人的人格，四知堂式的駡人，天然也和上二者有共通的心理，但他的本領格外高明，並不駡得使人怒髮衝冠，青筋亨起，只駡得人哭笑不得，開口不得，心裏難過，肚裏懊糟，這「南無溫」的駡人藝術之所以風行於人世也，</p>
<p>試問文人爲什麽專喜歡駡人呢？據駡人是「登龍」的終南捷徑，是否如此，我也無從得知。不過我曾見過的一段書，還未忘記，就把牠抄下來，作我的證明書罷。</p>
<p>四知氏曰，古今無眞名人，但能詆訶人則名歸之。孟子詆楊墨，莊周詆孔子，韓愈詆佛，豈好詆人哉？自爲名焉耳！故氏子遇當世大儒，皆極力疵詬之：且作嗔拳笑面曰，是才不如我，而名居我上，何也，或相見至有受其大詬者……故氏子居都會中，若空廬，行巷里間惟逢鷄犬草木，不能逢一人也。</p>
<h3>旱災中的故鄉</h3>
<p>— 志遠</p>
<p>火車，拖着滿廂的從都市裏逃回去的失業與飢餓的人羣，啞聲的長吼穿過破碎的，浙東，諸鄉，慢慢的喘息着停留於曹娥江邊的終站。</p>
<p>太陽的烈熖仍如一月來一樣的烘烤着地面，田間與河底爆得龜裂。本來現在應該是早稻的成熟期了；但是得不到水份的稻子正像没有奶吃的孩子一樣，矮矮的，黄黄的，如荒原的野草。稻的根被結在乾燥而龜裂的泥土上，葉的尖端枯焦得像火燒過了一樣。燥熱的夏風把牠們吹疊成焦色的稻波，在焦波的中間幾個被太陽晒焦了皮膚的農民眼望着半年來淌汗流血的結果祗剩了短短的幾根枯草，心裏的難過使他咬牙切齒的咒咀看丢棄手裏的水杓！涙珠夾着汗水直流的淌到足跟。</p>
<p>從百官向北到瀝海所一帶的塘外沙地，因爲没有河流，素來祗宜於種荳（我們平日吃的油余黄荳卽是）。本來今年的黄荳特别好，但是一個多月的亢旱把剛在結實中的黄荳枯死得只剩乾苦的荳桿子了。這種結果將使沿塘四五十村在特殊的隔年豫繳的貨幣地租制下的乾作農民墮入於不堪設想的飢饉恐慌之中了。</p>
<p>稻大半是無望了，但是農民們仍是死命的在鬥爭；他們同着自已幼弱的孩子和妻女，用二三部舊式的水車轉輾的從很遠的沙溪中把水一桶一杓的戽上田去。瘦得可憐的孩子受不了辛苦的勞動和烈日的烘蒸，背着自已的父親摸摸小手心上小足底上的水泡，怕懼似的措去留在眼中内的眼涙，失望的再工作下去。祗要什麽地方有水，他們就整日整夜不顧死活的去車去戽，直到點滴不存爲止！燥裂了的泥土是吸不飽水份的，點滴的水剛流過又燥了，水總是流不到田的全部。</p>
<p>在焦枯色的稻波與枯死的荳桿之間，壁直的公路像一條火蛇似的横伸着，平坦的飛機塲闊得與天空相接。千萬個苦力汗淋淋的在開岀，担石，拖着壓平機。鐵的鎚打在山巖隙間的鐵鑿上，臭的汗水滴在黄沙上。在鐵的火星下與火似的赤日下，吭唷吭唷的慘呼繼續着。</p>
<p>水，一滴都不剩了，五六十村的勞苦農民，僅依靠於幾個小池中的緑色臭水來過活。地主們的高廳大厦中的鮮潔「天下水」（天雨時用缸盛着的水）淌汗流血的牛馬是休想得到半碗的。崧厦附近十多村的農民找不到燒茶烹飯的水，於十五日那天一萬多個農民齊擁到沈家渡與塘灣的塘上，在農夫的鑼聲與人聲下大堤塘立刻被切斷了。雖然海水是鹹得像鹽湯一樣，但他們是渴得顧不到了。高貴的豪紳雖以「有害農田」等漂亮話來阻止没水渴的農民開塘，但是在羣衆力量的面前，他們祗逃跑避匿了。</p>
<p>農民的生活水準是苦得使人不能想像，早晨他們吃一頓玉蜀黍粉糊，中午時他們負着一百多斤的重担從烙鐵一樣的石路上回來時，是以小麥壓碎後和小許米粒拌着煮的麥屑飯來充飢，粗糙的麥粒使他們難以下咽，晚上又是一頓玉蜀黍糊或薄粥。在眼前的年頭，水災，豐災，旱災的掃掠，連這樣只配飼豬　的食糧也都被剥奪了。全中國的幾萬萬勞苦農民想都在慚顔的羡幕吃牛肉的都市貴狗吧！</p>
<p>伴着他們的飢餓與壓迫的累增，使他們的鬥爭力量也增長起來了。政府雖然允許他們有二五减租的權利，但是他們永不見政府來實行，現在他們已自已起來執行了，而且要求廢除殘酷的地租豫繳制，要求旱荒的减租與廢租－（因災情依地區而不同）</p>
<p>在旱荒的烽火中，在死與餓的旋風中，農民的前途在兩個可能性上擺動。</p>

<h3>「忍」的藝術</h3>
<p>— 華嬰</p>
<p>人家打你一拳，你至少要回他一拳，人家踢一脚，你亦至少要回他一脚。這才是「公平交易。」兩不吃虧。反之，人家打你一拳也好，踢你一脚也好，你只是一味忍，只當作他拳不是打在你身上，脚不是踢在你身上一樣。那末，人家便當你阿木林，處處給你當上。在你方面以爲忍字頭上有把刀，忍就忍一下吧！總不致吃虧的，實在並非你没有回他一拳一脚的本領。那裏曉得，你越是忍，則越是吃虧，人家只當你没用，那裏曉得你是有心忍。於是，你退一寸，他進一尺，你若爽爽快快回頭着給他一頓「生活」吃吃，問他下次還敢碰一碰老子嗎？他倒也抱頭而逃了，人是最怕强的，這便是很好的例子。</p>
<p>不過，一味忍旣然不行，却也有不　　　　　處。總之，一見風拉蓬爲最妥方法之一。譬如人家比你弱，他若在你面前神氣活現，你一定不要忍，非但他打了你一拳，你除將本再加利息奉還他外，並要使他下次在你面前不敢有如此神氣活現的威風擺出來，若你不幸而遇着比你强者，你卽須見機而退，以忍爲是，不得稍微有所疎忽。並且還須要和這些弱者説；改曰「我决和他打個明白」這就是所謂話要説得漂亮，恥辱是只好安放在心裏。</p>
<p>所以忍是一件痛苦不過的事，但是，在無力招架的時候，便要懂得這一點忍的藝術。庶乎能平一平氣，遮一遮紅面孔。</p>
<h3>夜心</h3>
<p>— 炯女士</p>
<p>這一天的天氣，像是回轉到了梅雨期般的，那末暗淡的，凉冰的一陣微雨之後，又是一陣陰晴。太陽深藏在朶朶的烏雲裏，綠透了的葉兒，在樹枝上隨風招展。四處的景物，却像陰霾裏的鬼域一樣的，使人戰慄起來！</p>
<p>到夜來，没有月光，陰慘的，凄寂的的連幾顆稀疏的微星，也被一陣狂風吹藏在雲層裏去了。只有那微明的街燈，鬼火似的在向我眯眼。我獨自的，拖着疲憊的步伐，漫緩的沿着馬路走，終於在一陣狂風從地上捲起足際，直抵了家門。</p>
<p>在黑暗的深夜裏回到了家來，本來該是一件如何快慰的事喲！又是這一次，却全然不是這末一回如我所理想的事。只是爲了整天的在外邊爲着事業的奔走，而到處碰壁，使我感到一種極端難過與不安，畢業與失業的悲哀，如蠶食葉似的在咀蝕我的心。房子裏的燈光，照着不整的家具，和桌子上零亂的書籍，顯示出一幅凄憐的畫圖。這景象也就深刻的反映在我的心中。</p>
<p>忐忑不安的心上，好像掛着一塊大的石子，在心田裏抛來抛去的搖動着。難道説：畢業眞的就是失業了麽？！</p>
<p>夜風在外邊活動着發出烏烏的響聲，一種難以形容的急燥和擾擾亂，隨着風聲的怒吼，而更加擴大到似乎將要爆裂的不可制止了！彷彿一切全都在幻滅中！</p>
<p>帶着一天疲勞過度的身子，終於因爲不可再支持的來計劃着今後奮鬥的程序，而勉力的躺在床上，滿想作一度的休息再説，誰知的無情的「現實」，像鐵鎚一樣的毫不惋惜的打擊着我的心，使之在夜裏。毫不能安眠的呻吟着！</p>
<p>凄凉的一隻燈光，伴着我孤寂的心，我望着窗外那龐大的黑暗巨物，附着嘯人的狂風，我的心，更不禁爲之抖然！</p>
<p>啊！我的心！在這深夜裏，孤寂的，暗淡的，像那梅雨天氣一樣的，陰暗的凄憐啊！</p>
<h3>荔枝時節</h3>
<p>— 人英</p>
<p>看到市頭鮮紅的荔枝，這又會使我想到是南島的荔枝時節。</p>
<p>孩子的時候，是愛喫水菓的。南島的童年，使我更愛吃荔枝。浮在冰水裏的荔枝是嫣紅的，剥去了生刺樣的壳；晶瑩的白肉會使我吊起了垂涎。大人們告誡我們，荔枝要沉在水底裏許多時候才可以喫；否則鼻管裏會流血。喫多了，也會犯同樣的毛病。孩子貪婪的慾望，時常逗着我生氣。</p>
<p>在荔枝時節，我們天天期待着弟弟的奶媽；她會送許多荔枝來。這個女人的輪廓，好像還在我的心頭。白胖胖的臉蛋，粗壯的腿。戴着三枚簪，穿着垂了紅絲頭的鞋。在夏天裏，她時常罣着妃紅的肚兜的。赤着腿肚這一付粗野的樣子，假使給上海的人們看到；準會認她是「猺山艷史」裏的角色。</p>
<p>她送來的荔枝是挺大的，又香又甜，而且核兒是這樣小小的一顆。</p>
<p>有一個年頭，軍閥地盤的鬭爭；又在南島的街頭撒下了鐵絲網。我們避到祥泰木行裏，大英的旗幟在屋頂裏飄揚着；這樣會避免敗兵的災害。</p>
<p>在綠草芊芊的塲地上拍着網球，或者在悠靜的竹林裏追逐着。這個時間的生活，是美滿的。大人們愁着地方會受到糜爛，孩子的心旌仍舊是和平的。而且我們可以盡量地喫，這一顆顆挺大的荔枝。</p>
<p>就在這年離開了南島，在上海的一個氏敎會學校裏讀書。每年的暑假，是要歸去一趟的。但是再没有孩時喫荔枝的心情了！荔枝應市的時節，就是離開南島的時候。童年的心兒，會被離愁籠罩住。</p>
<p>現在的個竟家，都搬到故鄉了。在什麽時候，再去尋找孩時的痕迹。</p>
<p>又是荔枝時節了，繁榮的夢兒被激得粉碎。自已要伸出粗大的臂膊，攫取麵包。遥想着辛勞的父親和在南島綰暑的妻；希望他們帶給我一些南島的消息。</p>

<h3>水性楊花</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>敝友王君於去年憑媒妁之言，老母之命娶某姓乙女爲室。（媒卽女之姊）婚後，感情尙稱事洽，且已受孕，惟乙女並未受過敎育，而女之父親亦無職業，有一姊，乃游藝塲中之賣唱者嫁與流氓爲妻，故舉止下流。今年王君因與表兄合開一廠，在王君家中，因此其表兄時與乙女相見，見女水性楊花，不久竟以愛王君之心，移愛其表兄。王君微有所聞，但無證據，不能如何，而家庭之中，遂因此而時生糾紛矣。最近乙女竟變本加厲，言王君母子虐待，唆使其姊糾集流氓多人，前來吵鬧，並説出種種恐嚇言詞。（如汝不取出錢了結，將置汝於死地等語）王君係一正當商人，况又受過敎育，因此日與其母，在悲嘆之中。今思求之法律，但未知從何着手，兹有疑問數則，伏乞一一解答，不勝感激之至。（一）可否向法院控訴離婚，（二）王君是否欲給乙女赡養費，（三）可否以妨害家庭罪控諸其姊或姊丈（其姊丈係一流氓，未知受法院判决後，王君欲受到不利否）敬請</p>
<p>道安　何益駿敬上</p>
<p>答：你所詢三點，現在分别答覆如下：（一）王君之妻，旣然糾集流氓，揚言要將其夫置之死地，這就具備了民法上呈訴離婚的「意圖殺害對方」的條件。民法上所謂意圖殺害，有了謀害之意思就可成立，不必有實據的，有了實據，那就不單是離婚，並要負刑事責任了。</p>
<p>（二）現在民法上對於判决離婚損害賠償之規定，須要對方過失，愛害人始得要求，至於赡養費，雖不採過失賠債主義，卽一方雖没有過失，如他方離婚後生活陷於困難，亦應給相當之赡養費，但是但是「他方」亦需「無過失」，如果他方之離婚係咎由自取，那就儘可不管了。</p>
<p>（三）如果證據確鑿，當然可以的。至於以後其姊丈是否會不利於王君，這話很難説。但單祗是「怕」和「容忍」也不是事，所以依我看，王君還是合法地去做，應告他還是告他。同時再愼密防範，如他有陰謀陷害時，立刻鳴警法辦。</p>

<h3>某夜（二）</h3>
<p>— 李懷瀛</p>
<p>於是樂亭籍小脚中年劉太太，和密安籍的寗太太，還有一個汪清籍只和丈夫唾了一宿就分别的孫太太，放下她們的憂鬱，每人按次説了句：</p>
<p>「這眞呌窮歡樂呀」。</p>
<p>「眼看就要死了，還不知道愁」。</p>
<p>「這才是没有法子的事情」。</p>
<p>鄭太太的饅頭並未吃完，僅只吃了三口，一抬手就抛到窗外去了，大聲地説：</p>
<p>「包飯作也氣人，總把饅頭裏作進一些塵土，這些個笨東西」。</p>
<p>她又吃到饅頭裏面的沙土了。正值這時屋外玩着的孩子們喊了起來：</p>
<p>「誰抛饅頭呀」？</p>
<p>「哪來的饅頭呀？誰抛的」？</p>
<p>鄭太太縮了縮舌頭，五個人對視着默不出聲，就像犯了盜案的賊人犯在警察的手中似的。因爲平常日在敎導兒女上，她們是嚴誡孩子們不要糟塌食物的</p>
<p>過一會，孩子們的咕呌聲止息了，屋了也就添出來香烟氣，廻旋着蕩漾着。忽然寗太太又開口説道：</p>
<p>「新疆也没有信，怎麽辦呢」？</p>
<p>好久以前，她們就在盼望新疆來信，但新疆足足有四五個月没有信來，聽説那方面在打仗，航空不通，信就郵不來。她們焦急呢。</p>
<p>「别作夢罷，新疆就算有信來，讓你去，你眞能去麽？用什麽去呀？你是能長出翅膀飛去，還是能像孫猴子一個根斗打出十萬八千里？眼看就要挨餓，過生活的錢都没有，想新疆來信有什麽用！不是白天作夢麽」！</p>
<p>好久没有出聲只是坐在旁邊呆着的劉太太，運用着她十足的關裏口音，大聲地説。</p>
<p>「還不知道這些人有没有呢，不是説那邊打仗打的很厲害麽，孫太太接下去説，「怎麽我們的命運就這麽不好呢？逃出日本人手裏，讓他們死在新疆，這是誰前世没有修好，作了孽，遭到這樣的報應」！</p>
<p>她從前是讀過私塾的，幾個人中是認字頂多的一個，每天無事就唱着唱本，小調，像是比别人寛心些。她原是説的氣憤話，不想鄭太太倒來打趣她了。哭着説：</p>
<p>「是呀，天老爺也不睜眼睛，人家才跟知心人唾一晚哪，天作孽」。</p>
<p>又引起人們一陣嘻笑。</p>

<h3>再論方言土語電影（上）</h3>
<p>— 丹楓</p>
<p>答唐納先生</p>
<p>連日來，在電影領域中引起了「大衆語」熱烈的論爭，的確是一種良好的現象。而唐納先生以最大的熱情，來堅持他的「大衆語」從方言土語高度發展之中建設起來的主張，雖然我們不能同意他的意見，但是在熱烈爭論以求問題得着一徹底的解决，這種現象仍然是很好的。</p>
<p>從他的「再論粤語聲片」一文中，我們可以知道，他的主張的來源，乃是根據了高荒先生的「大衆語，一定不是一元的國語式的東西，而是各各以當地的大衆爲對象的多元的發展」而來的。關於這種説法，我以爲是有語病的，至少是唐納先生曲解了他的原意。我們認爲「多元的發展」，是從多方面去採納各各方言土語中；在大衆生産過程中所必須的進步的語彙，卽是將個别的進步的語彚溶合在一種統一的普通話，成爲一般大衆所了解的而且必須使用的大衆語，而决不是多元的分裂，使各地的方言土語整個的單獨發展，形成一個民族中語言的四分五裂的現象。唐納先生所理解的「多元的發展」，事實上成爲「多元的　分裂」。</p>
<p>其次，唐納先生將發展各個民族的語言文化和發展各個地方的方言土語，相提並論，這無論如何是認識上的錯誤。我們必須知道各個民族的固有語言文化，它在傳統的關係上，它有着完全不同於另一民族之處，從文字的結構上以至於語言的構成，所以我們决不能以征服者的語言文化去代替被征服的民族的文化，以至於消滅它固有的文化，有如日本在東北强迫的使人們學日文，實行文化侵略一樣。相反的我們必須各個民族的語言文化自由獨立的發展。而漢族之中的語言文化，在文字的本身以至於語言的結構，都是完全統一的，祗是發音上的差别，所以這和民族與民族之間之差異完全不同。那末我們爲什麽不應當使其統一而反而使其分裂呢？</p>
<p>不錯，唐納先生所説的，也許就是由分裂到統一的見解，以爲現在已經分裂的，到不妨使其方言土語高度的發展，而後互相溶化的成爲大衆語。但是他却祗看見分裂的一面，而没有見到漸趨統一的一方。這裏需要比較詳盡的解釋。</p>
<p>自帝國主義的經濟侵入了中國農村之後，方言土語已經開始動摇起來，直到農村經過帝國主義經濟之掃盪，鄉村破産之後，大批的農民流到都市中來，他們所帶來的家鄉土話，已經不够實用，於是一種在生産過程中共同的言語産生出來，他們所説的都不是純粹的家鄉土話，而是一種大家都能了解的普通話。這種普通話的存在，該是誰也不敢否認的，那末這便是大衆語的基礎，再充分的採用各地土語中有積極的「語彚」，以充實它的内容。反之我們决不能扶植各個的方言土語之發展，使其成爲彼此不相通的語言。難道説在一個工廠中各地方匯集而來的工人，也要每人都説着他們的家鄉土話嗎？（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「伶人紅運」</h3>
<p>— 憶君</p>
<p>Up　To　The　Neck－大上海映</p>
<p>「伶人紅運」是一張英國片，一張水平綫下的英國片。</p>
<p>題名已經告訴了我們關於這一張影片的内容，一個伶人怎樣得到了他的「紅運」。</p>
<p>這樣的一個陳舊而平凡的故事，加以導演的處理的手法不善，我們不能不承認它是整個的失敗。</p>
<p>用伶人來作電影題材的，並不是少數，而描寫一個伶人怎樣從落魄以至於成名的故事，更是屢見不鮮，而「伶人紅運」的劇作者對於這種千篇一律的空虚題材，緊抓住不放，可見劇作者是怎樣的淺薄與幼稚。</p>
<p>在現實的社會裏，有很多值得暴露的事實，然而，他們却没有認識現實，理解現實，接觸現實的。</p>
<p>他們只是在陳腐裏找題材，他們的主觀的幻想就是一個落魄的伶人會突如其來的得到十五萬鎊的遺産，會得到一個天仙般的美女，會一舉成名，……。</p>
<p>平凡，陳腐，幻想，……這就是一伶人紅運」的全部。</p>
<p>在「伶人紅運」裏，到處留着矯揉造作的痕跡，而導演的手法的紊亂，支離，以及前後情緒的不相貫澈，殊難一一的指出。</p>
<p>演員們也均平平。</p>
<h3>評「冤獄」</h3>
<p>— 丹楓</p>
<p>Shadows　of　Sing　Sing</p>
<p>－大光明－</p>
<p>夏天少有好的影片可看，已經成爲一般人所周知的事。而這一「冤獄」，在大光明根本就只想映兩天，作爲過渡的影片，其價舉也就可想而知。</p>
<p>哥倫比亞公司少有好的作品，也是衆所周知的事，不久以前，雖然有一個「太夫人」，給軟性的紳士們捧爲無上至寳，然而那空想的内容决定了作品的命運，决不是形式主義所可挽救的。此外，我們也看過幾部較爲有價值的影片，但是爲數甚微。而這一部「冤獄」，簡直可以説完全失敗的作品。</p>
<p>主要的是劇作者完全不能探求社會的眞實，以致於劇中人物都成爲没有社會根據的浮薄的人物。而這一影片作爲偵探片而出現，可是在劇的進行中，除了那些生硬勉强的疑陣和伏綫的佈置之外，其他更可取的編劇技巧，在這裏是看不到的。</p>
<p>在這故事中，我們所能看到的祗是美國的法律和現有制度的歌頌，以至於警察的幹練和機警或牢獄管理的科學化，除此以外，我們是没有可能獲得我們所需要知道的東西。至於惡人應有惡報的武斷的概念，更表示出劇作者的庸俗和拙劣。然而假使有人要從警察偵探長的兒子和大盜的妹妹發生愛情方面，找出什麽新的解釋來，那顯然是多餘的不必要的工作。關於這一方面，所有的是巧合不通，比較眞實的，簡直就祗有偵探長禁止他的兒子和大盜之妹戀愛的一點。</p>
<p>Phil　Rosen總該是美國的第三流的導演吧？雖説我們對於他過於不知道，可是從這一部作品上看來，大體我們可以證明他是一個庸俗無能的。從第一個鏡頭到最後一個鏡頭，我們祗看到劇中人在沉悶的空氣中浮游。連竇柏和薇綺的愛情描寫也算在内，導演是没有一點方法抓住觀衆的感情，我們觀衆祗好極煩惱的呼吸那悶的空氣。</p>
<p>至於導演對於劇中人的性格，没有探刻的描寫，又加上演員們演技的生疏，都是帮助着埋塟這一影片到失敗的深坑中去。</p>
<p>「蜂醉蝶迷」中之一幕－牀頭黄臉婆，去在九霄雲外了」－南京映</p>
<h3>「蜂醉蝶迷」中的酒色關頭</h3>
<p>大西洋城（Atiantlc　City）是美國的紙迷金醉的塲所。在那裏，羅曼斯是不斷地發生，同時大企業之盛大集會，往往也在這兒舉行，所以美國人有句口頭語，「或許在大西洋城相見過」，就等於吾人所説「面熟陌生」。但是語氣之間，多少含些輕薄意味，何况往往用之於異性們呢？大西洋城混名爲「會議城」，大概實基於此。</p>
<p>赫湼惠橡皮公司舉行大會，路局裏專車，湧出了人羣的狂流。内中閃鑠着華納的十顆大明星，他們或她們，偶然被命運連鎖着，野心驅使着，無意的優遊，有目的的追求。總之，這一段羅曼史中重要人物，有男的女的高業專家，懼内而又漁色的老夫，妒忌異常時老婦，日游糟粕的酒聖，少年好事的哥兒，更有一位專事勾引，採金吸血的妙人兒。她底生活的對象——黄金。</p>
<p>試問如此的良辰美景，當然引起了不少豪興逸致。</p>
<p>所恨的是天地不仁，以萬物爲芻狗，人跡所到之處，總滿佈下機詐的穽陷，旁攻側擊，變化無端。綜觀「蜂醉蝶迷」全劇，入主出奴，爾虞我詐，誠難形諸筆墨。　之蛺蝶穿花，迷離撲索，不可捉摸。所謂酒色關頭，夫人而知。至於瓊白朗黛兒亞道夫孟郁等的奇才妙技，的確用不着介紹的。</p>

<h3>佳兒佳婦（Born　to　be　Kissed）（五）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>憶迪是有百折不回的精神的女子。她雖然受了·潘其的打發，但她却並不因此而灰心。她反將潘其給她的錢，提出一部份出來，購了車票，和吉弟一同到棕閭海濱去了。潘其並没有告訴她，他到棕閭海濱去，但她却從别處打聽了出來。吉弟這次做了憶迪的伴婦，本來是不甚願意的，因爲她覺得憶迪要追求百萬富翁，反而失去了許多好機會。在吉弟的眼光中看來，一個美貌的司閽人，一個着制服的汽車夫，一個頭髮蜷曲的電梯司機，比憶弟空望想中的百萬富翁實惠得多了。但是憶弟立志很堅决，不肯放棄她的主張。她們要同到棕閭海濱，去尋潘其，她們那兒來工夫，用到别人身上去呢？</p>
<p>她們居然到了棕閭海濱了。在潘其公司的棕閭海濱分行裏，她們去尋找潘其，但是潘其的私人秘書，呌紐白蘭小姐的，那是憶迪所認爲不懂事的老貓的，却告訴她説潘其没有來。憶迪疑信參半地，正想退出來。她正在盤算着如何進行的方法，忽然一個少年走了過來。她興怱怱地問着憶迪道：「早晨好。有什麽事，我可以帮忙的嗎？」憶迪神氣十足地對着他道：「我等着要見潘其先生哩」。那少年道：「哦，我就是潘其先生呀」。憶迪看了他一眼，很生氣似的道：「哦，你是嗎？好，那我是梵特别爾夫人」。她並且指着吉弟道：「這位就是亞士託爾夫人」。兩位都是有名的人物。那少年笑着鞠了一個躬説道：「潘其今天運氣不好。大概他今天不來了吧」。憶迪聽了，望了一望吉弟，然後説道：「那我們到他家裏去吧」。她站了起來，向門外走着，但是那個少年又攔住了她們的去路道：「他亦不在家……我請你們吃中飯，好不好」？憶迪毅然决然地道：「用不着，謝謝你」。她不管三七二十一，拉着吉弟就往外跑。</p>
<p>棕閭海濱有一種很時髦的代步，就是人力推送的脚踏車椅子。她們二人是坐了那種椅子，來到潘其的公事房的。現在她們二人仍舊跳上了等候着的脚踏車椅子，却不知道這時那個少年，已經拿了一張鈔票給了那個車夫，自已跨了上去推送着。這時吉弟對着憶迪生氣道：「爲什麽我們還不舒舒服服的，在這裏玩它一天呢？憶迪道：「就是因爲我們要做貴婦人的緣故」？吉弟道：「剛才那個年輕的行員請我們吃飯，難道我們和他吃飯，就不能做貴婦人了嗎」？憶迪道：「唉，你不明白。一個女子遇見了一個年輕美貌的男子，像剛才那個行員似的，是很容易着迷的——但是結果恐怕祗會住進紐亞克城的一所小平房，恐怕到後來，還要替小孩子洗襯袴哩」。她們正談論着，突然聽見後面格格格，笑了起來。那個車子突然間離開了馬路，蹦到草地上，向一顆棕樹直撞上去。車身亦立時撞翻了，將她們二人摔在草地上。憶迪一骨落爬了起來，直向那車夫奔了上去，口裏駡道：「你知道你是什麽東西……但是她又立即站住了，眼睛瞪着那個假車夫。（未完）</p>

<h3>Qinhuangdao, Japan Conducts Joint Naval and Army Exercises, Contending for the Harbor; Japanese Troops Stationed in Tianjin Continue to Move Towards Yuguan and Qinhuangdao; Five British Warships Arrive</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army stationed in Qinhuangdao, in conjunction with marines, held a harbor seizure exercise at 2 p.m. on the 31st. They also camped on the beach, with the sound of machine guns crackling incessantly throughout the night.  Exercises continued on the 1st, starting at 8 a.m. and ending at 3 p.m. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China arrived at Qinhuangdao on the 31st at 1 p.m. aboard a Kailuan Mining Company auxiliary ship and immediately transferred to Shanhaiguan to inspect British troop exercises.  British troops are conducting large-scale exercises along the Beining Railway line.  The Japanese army is also simultaneously conducting exercises in Qinhuangdao and Yuguan.  The atmosphere is somewhat tense at the moment.  The British warship "Adventure," normally stationed in Weihaiwei, arrived in Qinhuangdao on the 31st and anchored at Kailuan Mining Pier No. 2. Three more cruisers arrived in the afternoon. In the morning of the 1st, a flagship also arrived, bringing the total number of British warships to five. A French warship is also expected to arrive on the island this afternoon. The largest British warship anchored in Qinhuangdao is the "Folkestone," commanded by Captain Manners, with 757 officers and crew, and one seaplane, with a total of 24 front, rear, and side guns. Also, the "Formosa," commanded by Captain Ward, has 121 officers and crew, with a total of 5 front, rear and side guns. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning, 210 Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin, along with six boxes of ammunition, 30 horses, and four cannons, boarded a Beining Railway train and headed east to Yuguan to join the large-scale combat exercise of Japanese troops in Qinyu and to demonstrate against the British troops. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Foreign sources report that Okamura, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, stated regarding the war zone issue that the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the demilitarized zone and other issues will be discussed with Chinese commissioners at any time in the future. Regarding the stalemate in the handover of Malanyu, which is related to the preservation of the Eastern Tombs, the Japanese side will use the excuse that Puyi does not want his ancestors' tombs to be protected by the Chinese. Therefore, the Japanese side still intends to delay the matter by using the preservation of the Eastern Tombs as a pretext. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Yuguan said that 200 British soldiers were still conducting exercises in Yuguan as usual on the 2nd.  Igi, the chief of the Japanese Special Service Agency stationed in Yuguan, had issued a notice to the garrisons of various countries in Tianjin, refusing the exercises of the troops of various countries. Since the countries did not respond, Igi left Yuguan at the end of last month and went to Changchun to ask the Kwantung Army for instructions. Igi has returned to Yuguan. It is heard that Japan has decided to resolve the issue of British troops crossing the border to conduct exercises with an appropriate attitude. Other foreign garrisons have not yet responded to the Japanese notice and will take the same attitude as the British. However, since receiving the Japanese notice, the British seem unwilling to conduct exercises outside the border to avoid disputes. It is also reported that British troops, from 5:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. on July 25th, fired machine guns and small-caliber mortar shells for four hours into Chinese territory south of Dashikou. It can be seen that the British side seems to have the intention of avoiding disputes. It is also reported that Igi had previously told Japanese reporters that he had issued a notice to various countries. The British replied that the United Kingdom has not yet recognized Manchukuo, so Manchukuo is still a part of Chinese territory. Based on the text of the Boxer Protocol, the United Kingdom believes that it has the freedom to conduct exercises within Manchukuo, and does not understand the meaning of the Japanese notice. However, the Japanese side, based on its established policy, is determined to take decisive action. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteers Take Action</h3>
<p>Once Attacking Siping Street</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Nan Siping Street Township, the capital of the puppet state, was attacked on the 28th by over 400 troops of the volunteer army led by Lin Haoshan and Maomao, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese railway garrison for four hours, killing 13 Japanese soldiers and one sergeant, and seizing a machine gun before retreating.  Siping Street has now declared martial law and is searching travelers. The Dapu Caihe Township in Huadian County, Jilin Province, was occupied by Wang Delin's volunteer forces. The puppet army of 400 was defeated. They are now jointly holding Hancong River in Dunhua County with the Japanese Jidun Railway garrison to prevent the volunteer army from advancing.

<h3>Preparations Underway for Establishing Branch Customs Posts at Various Passes Along the Great Wall</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Preparations are actively underway for the establishment of branch customs posts at various passes along the Great Wall and the Ping General Office. Zhang Yongnian went to Tianjin a few days ago to liaise with the customs authorities. After completing the matter, he returned to Beiping last night. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Visits the Japanese and Russian Consuls in Zhangjiakou Separately</h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou Song Zheyuan visited the Japanese and Russian consuls in Zhangjiakou separately on the morning of the 2nd. In the evening, Song and his wife hosted a banquet at the provincial government for the Japanese Consul Hashimoto and his wife, the Russian Consul Demintief and his wife, and invited leaders of various organizations and their wives to accompany them. (2nd Dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Authority of the Hebei Provincial Security Headquarters</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Provincial Government has stipulated the authority of the Provincial Security Headquarters throughout the province, including:</p>
<p>Jurisdiction over: (1) County Defense Regiments; (2) District Training Offices; (3) Hebei Special Police First, Second, and Third Regiments, Hebei War Zone Security Supplementary Regiment; (4) Security Brigade of the Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital; (5) Hebei Provincial Defense Regiment Cadre Training Center. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Joint Celebration of Chinese and Japanese Managers of the Oriental Travel Agency</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) For the sake of joint celebration, Zhang Shuiqi, the Chinese manager of the Oriental Travel Agency, and Hirayama, the Japanese manager, have scheduled a banquet in Shanhaiguan on the 4th at noon. The company has invited the director and department heads of the Beining Railway Bureau and the department heads of the Puppet Railway Bureau. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Controls Soybean Production in Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) In order to control soybean production in the Eastern Provinces, the Japanese organized the "Manchuria Soybean Company," with a capital of 1.5 million yuan, divided into 15,000 shares. It was formally established on the 23rd of last month. The organizers are all Japanese. (2nd Dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Actively Reinforcing Defenses Along the Great Wall; Japanese and Puppet Generals Confer in Chengde</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army is actively reinforcing defenses at various passes along the Great Wall. According to someone from Gubeikou, Toihara, the chief of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shenyang, arrived in Chengde and has been holding important meetings with puppet military officers of Jehol Province for days. At the same time, the Puppet Ministry of Military Affairs instructed Guan Xizhe to actively inspect the puppet troops in various counties of Jehol Province. The inspection of the garrisons in Lingnan, Lingyuan, and Weichang in northern Jehol has now been completed. He is scheduled to leave Jehol at the beginning of this month and return to Changchun to report. Major General Tada, the high-ranking advisor of the Puppet Ministry of Military Affairs, arrived in Jehol by plane on the morning of July 25th, staying at the Chengde Hotel. Tada's visit to Jehol is of greater significance. Japan is preparing for war against Russia and has decided to increase its troop strength along the Great Wall passes and other places in Chahar Province. The command hub for reinforcing troops will be centered in Chengde, so Japanese and puppet generals are gathering in Chengde to plan everything. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet organization, under the order of the Kwantung Army, officially announced the names of the provincial garrison commanders and their areas of responsibility on July 27th, as follows: (1) General Yu Zhishan was appointed commander of the First Military District; (2) General Ji Xing was appointed commander of the Second Military District; (3) Lieutenant General Zhang Wenzhu was appointed commander of the Third Military District; (4) General Yu Zhengchen, commander of the Northern Manchuria Railway Protection Army, concurrently appointed commander of the Fourth Military District; (5) General Zhang Hai Peng, concurrently appointed commander of the Fifth Military District. The puppet side's division of military districts is purely to divide the power of the puppet army to prevent them from turning against Japan and resisting the invasion. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bandits Infest Malanyu; Commissioner's Office Sends Security Team to Suppress; Eastern Tomb Preservation Issue Still Not Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tixin, the director of Malanyu, telegraphed that bandits are springing up in the area due to the growing green crops. He requested that the Jizhou-Miyun Commissioner's Office send a security team to suppress them. The office has ordered Wei Yonghe, the commander of the Second Security Regiment, to dispatch a unit to suppress them. The unit will be able to set out within two or three days. Han Dianbang, the commander of the Yutian Security Regiment, went to Tianjin to meet with Yu [Xuezhong] to report on the situation of the Yutian Security Regiment. He returned to Beiping last night. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Malanyu and Eastern Tomb handover incident, after Chaishan returned to Beiping from Dalian, he immediately contacted Yin Rugeng to discuss the handling methods. Yin Tixin, the director stationed in Malanyu, returned to Malanyu from Beiping at the end of last month to prepare all the procedures. Yin Rugeng will go to Tianjin within the next few days to meet with Yu Xuezhong, report on everything, and make some requests. At the latest, before the middle of next month, Yin will jointly go to Malanyu with Chaishan to handle the handover procedures. When Malanyu and the Eastern Tombs are handed over, it is hoped that the puppet troops stationed in the area will withdraw. During the transition period, our side has made preparations for local security and will order some old security teams to be transferred to the area to take over defense. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming left Tianjin by train this morning to return to Tangshan. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>PingSui Railway Track Repaired After Flooding</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The PingSui Railway line has suffered severe damage due to several mountain floods in the past month. The railway has dispatched Jin Tao and others to supervise the work and actively repair the damage. It has now been completely completed. Although the Qixiaying station was recently washed out again by floods, and the roadbed was sunk by about half a mile, it has now been repaired. The Railway Bureau has now ordered all major stations along the line to dispatch trains to test the tracks in sections. If the results are satisfactory, a full line trial operation between Ping and Baotou will begin on the 3rd. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Branch Conference posted a notice along the stations of the Sui Railway, stating that more than 230 track spikes were lost in the area below the PingSui Railway.

<h3>Mourning President Hindenburg of Germany</h3>
<p>For the past two or three days, foreign dispatches have frequently reported that German President Hindenburg was in ill health and on the verge of death. Those concerned about the Central European situation and the future of Germany were worried. Those who admired Hindenburg's great personality especially prayed for his well-being. Who knew that the tragic news would arrive? This great hero of a generation suddenly passed away. This is indeed a great loss for Germany today, and we cannot help but feel grief as we recall Hindenburg's past great achievements.</p>
<p>The great point of Hindenburg's personality lies in knowing only the nation and not the individual, knowing only the people and not the party, and valuing action over words. When the European War broke out, Hindenburg was already sixty-seven years old. According to German military law, soldiers over sixty-five years of age must retire. He was living a life of leisure in retirement when he received an edict from the German Emperor. He did not decline due to his old age but bravely faced the national crisis. If he did not have the country in mind, how could he have achieved this? What is most admirable is the attitude Hindenburg took during the German Revolution of 1918. At that time, Hindenburg held military power and had great authority. If he had personal ambitions, it would not have been difficult to suppress the revolutionary party and gain the highest position. However, Hindenburg feared plunging the country into a state of division and disintegration, so he did not hesitate to accept the orders of the provisional government, restrain the army, and return to his country. After the army was disbanded, he retired peacefully, without any regrets. Looking at his advancement and retreat, his uprightness and lack of concern for personal gains are rarely seen in modern times. When President Ebert died in 1925, the Germans all recommended Hindenburg as his successor. On the night of the vote, Hindenburg was still able to sleep peacefully, ignoring the election news. His lack of interest in fame and fortune was very obvious. Only when he was elected president did he not hesitate to take on great difficulties in his declining years, without being perfunctory. All of this is worthy of being a model for people around the world.</p>
<p>Because his personal conduct always took the country as the premise, Hindenburg alone was able to transcend the disputes of political parties and stand firm as the mainstay of the country, a rare treasure. During the imperial era, he was loyal to Kaiser Wilhelm, because he wanted to serve the country. When he became the president of the republic, he treated all political parties equally, because he wanted public opinion to have free expression and did not want to favor any one side. Therefore, over the past seven or eight years, Hindenburg has been able to cooperate with the Social Democratic Party, join hands with the Center Party, and give the National Socialist Party the opportunity to govern. If he had been biased, how could he have achieved this? After the presidential re-election two years ago, Hindenburg told the people, "I am not a representative of any political party. What I want to respond to is the call of the entire nation." These are sincere words. Only Hindenburg can match them.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of Hindenburg is that he values action over words. His life's work was all accomplished in silence, and what contributed to his success was a strong will, a calm mind, not swayed by emotions, and not controlled by the environment. Whether leading troops or presiding over politics, he was able to handle things with ease because his command was decisive. For example, during the presidential re-election two years ago, Hitler and others made great efforts to promote themselves in competition, but Hindenburg did not say a word to seek election. When he was elected, he used only a few words to express to the people his loyalty to bear the burden of reviving the motherland. His intention was to gain the trust of the people with facts, not to compete with others by relying on eloquence. Other virtues, such as his broad-mindedness, magnanimity, strict self-discipline, and tolerance towards others, were all virtues of Hindenburg. Germans, regardless of age, all respected Hindenburg. Half of this was due to Hindenburg's great achievements, and half was due to Hindenburg's great personality. According to a dispatch from Berlin, many Germans sobbed and wept when they heard that Hindenburg was critically ill. If he had not moved them deeply, how could this have happened?</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Hindenburg was the only leader of Germany today. It is often said that the highest requirement for a leader is to be tolerant. We believe this even more after observing Hindenburg's life. Before Hitler came to power two years ago, he openly said that Hindenburg was old and would not live much longer, and that power would inevitably belong to him in the future. Compared with Hindenburg, his self-confidence was incomparable. Once Hitler gained power, he brutally killed dissidents. The ruthlessness of his methods was fully demonstrated in the June 30th Incident. Although Hindenburg did not say a word about the course of the incident, his painstaking efforts to accommodate the National Socialist Party were seen by the world. Now that Hindenburg is gone, the country is in urgent need of a guiding force, but has suddenly lost its center of gravity. The successor to the presidency has yet to be re-elected. In this time of temporary assumption of power, will Hitler be able to carry on Hindenburg's legacy, change his previous image, and seek compromise with the opposition? Or will he intensify his efforts and go his own way, plunging the country into an increasingly dangerous situation? Before Hindenburg died, he had a long conversation with Hitler for an hour. Perhaps Hindenburg gave his last piece of advice and hoped that Hitler would adopt it. If Hitler can understand this intention, it would not only be fortunate for Hindenburg, but also fortunate for the Germans.</p>
<h3>Hindenburg Passed Away at 9 AM Yesterday, Which Happened to Be the 20th Anniversary of the Outbreak of the European War. The Tragic News Spread Throughout Germany, as if They Had Lost Their Parents. Hitler Assumed the Position of President and Grand Marshal, Violating the Spirit of the Constitution.</h3>
<p>Neudeck. The hero of Germany, President Hindenburg, passed away at 9:00 this morning. The President was unconscious this morning, and entered a state of dying at 8:00. He passed away an hour later, at the age of 86. (2nd National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Hitler Jumped from Sergeant to Army Grand Marshal Without Seeking National Consent, Which Obviously Conflicts with the Constitution. The President's Last Words Were Not Released by the Government.</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler, having assumed the position of President, is naturally the Grand Marshal of the Army. He was formerly a sergeant, but now he is the leader of the army. Although he assumed the position of President without obtaining the consent of the people, which conflicts with the Constitution, Hitler seems to be supported by the people and the army. The day of Hindenburg's death coincided with the 20th anniversary of the outbreak of the Great War. Hindenburg was 86 years and nine months old, and his father died at the same age. It is quite a coincidence. The Neudeck villa is still guarded by the National Defense Army, and anyone who wants to enter the villa is stopped by the military police, including journalists. As of 3:35 this afternoon, no information has been released about Hindenburg's last moments and his last words. Within minutes of his death, telegrams and telephones were completely monopolized by government officials, and officials were driving around, which shows that they have important work to do. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Church Bells Toll, All Entertainment is Suspended, and Flags are Lowered to Half-Mast to Mourn</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After the news of President Hindenburg's death was announced, the whole of Germany was united in deep mourning, as if they had lost their parents. The National Socialist Party and its organizations immediately began a formal two-week mourning period. Interior Minister Frick also announced a national mourning period until after the funeral. All government offices lowered their flags to half-mast. Churches were ordered to toll bells daily from 8:00 to 9:00 AM to mourn, also until after the funeral. Music was forbidden in public places, and all officials wore black armbands to mourn. Ships and barracks also lowered their flags to half-mast. On the day of the funeral, all traffic will stop for one minute, and factories will stop work for one hour. All public banquets are prohibited. The news of President Hindenburg's death was broadcast throughout the country by Propaganda Minister Goebbels at 9:45 this morning. He declared that President Hindenburg passed away at 9:00 this morning, with only his family by his side. At 9:20 this morning, the flag at the Presidential Villa in Neudeck was lowered to half-mast, which was the first tragic news of the President's death. In the early morning, farmers along the road looked up and saw the presidential flag lowered halfway down the flagpole. They solemnly stood up, took off their hats, and bowed their heads in silence. At that time, the Neudeck Church bells also sounded a mournful tone. The farmers gathered in groups and recalled the past events of the elder statesman in a sad and respectful tone. The windows of the villa were tightly curtained, which means that the President had passed away. (2nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German President Hindenburg died in Neudeck Villa this morning, at the age of eighty-seven. According to a doctor's report this morning, the German President was increasingly weak, and had entered a state of coma, and it was feared that he would not survive the day. At 5:00 this morning, Hindenburg's children and daughters-in-law were summoned to his bedside. After the President died, the villa immediately flew the flag at half-mast. It was 9:00 AM, and journalists saw it and telegraphed it abroad.</p>
<h3>The Powers of the President and Premier are Merged. It is Rumored that the Cabinet Convened an Emergency Meeting and Passed a Law Merging the Two Offices of President and Premier into One. Premier Hitler Immediately Assumed the Position of President. From Now On, Herr Hitler May Be Renamed Head of State of Germany. (Reuters</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The cabinet passed a law stipulating that the duties of the President and Premier should be concurrently held by Premier Hitler. This law has been promulgated and contains two articles. The first article states, "It is hereby stipulated that the duties of the President and Premier are merged. All current presidential powers shall be exercised by Premier Hitler, the leader, and by the person he designates to act as his agent." The second article states, "This law shall take effect from the moment of the death of President Hindenburg."</p>
<h3>The Army Swore Allegiance to Hitler. Defense Minister von Blomberg Ordered the Army and Navy to Swear Allegiance to Hitler Personally.</h3>
<p>The words are as follows: [I hereby make this sacred oath to God, Hitler is the leader of the German nation and people, I swear to obey without reservation, and in the spirit of a brave soldier, I will fulfill my oath at all times, even if it means dying a hundred times]." (2nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Newly Promulgated Laws Violate the Weimar Constitution and Have the Nature of a Political Revolution.</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today, the cabinet promulgated a law appointing Hitler to exercise the functions of the President. This procedure was originally permitted by Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, and Article 51 also stipulates that when the President is unable to perform his duties for any reason, the Premier shall exercise them first until a new President is elected. However, today's cabinet law establishes a purely personal relationship between the presidential duties and Premier Hitler (that is, the presidential duties are exercised by Hitler in his personal capacity, not in his capacity as Premier). This is absolutely revolutionary in nature. In addition, Defense Minister General von Blomberg's order for the army and navy to swear allegiance to Hitler personally is also a revolutionary measure. Until this morning, the Weimar Constitution had not been declared abolished in law, but today's cabinet laws are absolutely contrary to the letter and spirit of the Weimar Constitution.

Burying him there is to commemorate his military achievements. (2nd National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Yesterday, Premier Hitler had a secret talk with President Hindenburg for an hour. No one was present at the time, so the content could not be confirmed. However, it is believed that the issue of the successor to the presidency must have been discussed. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to a message released by the German News Agency, Premier Hitler sent the following telegram to Colonel Hindenburg and his wife (the President's son and daughter-in-law), stating that "I still have the image of my general and late president in my mind from the last time I talked to him. How could I imagine that this tragic news would come so quickly. The whole nation is in deep sorrow with me. I offer my condolences. Please be aware of this." (2nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Ex-Emperor Wilhelm Bitterly Mourned. Scheidemann, Ex-Emperor</h3>
<p>When Wilhelm and his family received the tragic news of President Hindenburg, they were deeply saddened. The Grand Chamberlain of the Ex-Emperor's Palace here declared, "We were all shocked by the tragic news of President Hindenburg."

May God bless the life that has suddenly passed away. The Crown Prince will personally go to Neudeck to pay his last respects to this hero of Tannenberg." The telegram was signed Wilhelm.

<h3>Condolence Cables from Various Countries Came Like Snowflakes. Berlin Germany</h3>
<p>The German people regarded President Hindenburg as a deity who protected Germany, and they loved him deeply. Therefore, when the tragic news came out, the whole country was shocked and mourned. Condolence cables were sent from all over like snowflakes. When French Premier Doumergue heard the tragic news, he immediately ordered the Chief of the Office of the Council of State to offer condolences to German Ambassador Custode and to telegraph Hitler to express his sympathy. (2nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Cowes. King George of England sent a telegram from his yacht today to condole with the son of the late President Hindenburg, saying, "I am deeply saddened to hear of the death of your father.

<h3>A Brief Biography of Hindenburg</h3>
<p>Descended from a family of generals. Paul von Hindenburg came from a family of generals, studied martial arts in his youth, and was skilled in the art of war. In a certain year, during a German army exercise, Hindenburg and German Emperor Wilhelm II each led an army to conduct a mock battle. The Northern Army led by the German Emperor was repeatedly defeated. At the end of the battle, the winner was judged. Hindenburg became carried away and suddenly said to the Emperor, "If Your Majesty were an enemy general, today the entire Northern Army would have entered the North Sea and become food for the fish." The Emperor's face changed abruptly, and Hindenburg immediately regretted his slip of the tongue and was uneasy. Therefore, he asked for retirement to test the Emperor, and the Emperor granted it. From then on, Herr Hindenburg retired to Hanover and forgot about fame and fortune.</p>
<h3>Gained Fame in the European War</h3>
<p>In 1914, when the European War broke out, the Russian army invaded East Prussia on a large scale and captured famous cities in succession. The German court and public were shocked. Under public pressure, the German Emperor humbly telegraphed Hindenburg to Beijing, appointing him as the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Region. Hindenburg then deployed a pincer formation to lure the enemy deep. In one battle, he recovered all the lost territory. This was the Battle of Tannenberg. On the eve of the battle, Hindenburg wrote a letter to his wife, in which he said, "I believe that the old man will eventually become famous." Unexpectedly, the joke came true. After this victory, Hindenburg was given the title of "Savior of the Motherland," promoted to general, and was highly respected by the people. Even the German Emperor, who was fond of self-esteem, had to pay his respects to him. The so-called hero of the times, Hindenburg, is indeed well-deserved. However, if he had not been well-prepared, how could he have been so lucky to gain fame?</p>
<h3>Rose Again</h3>
<p>Hindenburg was later promoted to Supreme Commander of the German Army. When the European War ended, Hindenburg thought that his career had been accomplished and that he could retire to the countryside and await his destiny in peace. However, after six years, the country suffered a major disaster. He rose again and built a career that surpassed his previous achievements. Hindenburg was already over seventy years old at the time. As an ancient poem says, "The sunset is infinitely beautiful." This can be used to describe Hindenburg's achievements in his later years.</p>
<h3>First Term as President</h3>
<p>Previously, Albert, the first president of the German Republic after the war, died in office. The Republican Party was greatly frightened. Later, when they heard that Hindenburg had agreed to be a presidential candidate, they were even more terrified, as were the Conservative Party. They feared that a military man in power would be detrimental to the future of the Republic.</p>
<h3>People's Hearts were Conquered</h3>
<p>However, not long after this old general took office, the people's hearts were conquered. The Royalist Party, which was initially happy, is now worried. Hindenburg's personality is full of the strong virtues of the German nation, and he is also loyal to his duties, treats people with sincerity, and is very frugal. Even those who disagree with him are moved. It is said that since the Iron Chancellor Bismarck, no one in power has been as loved by the people and whose prestige can influence the entire country as Hindenburg. This is no exaggeration.</p>
<h3>Half a Life in the Military</h3>
<p>Hindenburg was born in Posen, Prussia, on October 2, 1847. Today, that place has been incorporated into Poland. His father was a Prussian army officer. For more than 300 years, the sons of the Hindenburg family have been engaged in military careers. Those who rose through military merit have been the people of the generation. Hindenburg studied at military school in his youth. At the age of thirty-two, he was taken into the Army General Staff.</p>
<h3>Grandchildren Surround His Knees</h3>
<p>Then he married Miss Sperling, who was eighteen years old, as his wife. His wife was virtuous and outstanding. The couple had a good relationship and had one son and two daughters. She died in 1921. His son, Wathes, is also in the army. Both daughters married military officers. Hindenburg's grandchildren are now surrounding his knees.</p>
<h3>Extraordinary Strategies to Defeat the Enemy</h3>
<p>Before the World War, Hindenburg participated in the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War. The success of the Battle of Tannenberg was due to the experience he gained in these two wars. After the victory of the Battle of Tannenberg, Hindenburg received national honors and honorary degrees from nine German universities, as well as freedom from several university towns. The East Prussian metropolis of Königsberg gave him a PhD in all four faculties of the university to show its respect, because Hindenburg drove away the Russian army, allowing the Germans to avoid the ravages of barbarism and gain an indelible reputation. A week after the victory of the Battle of Tannenberg, Hindenburg defeated the Russian army at the Masurian Lakes, and the crisis in the East was completely resolved. Later, he used several extraordinary strategies to defeat the Russian army at Lodz in Poland.</p>
<h3>Repeated Achievements</h3>
<p>The German army repeatedly won battles, and its morale was greatly boosted. Hindenburg then became famous in all countries and his prestige shook the world. In 1916, he was appointed as the Supreme Commander of the German Army, taking overall charge of the military. At that time, the eastern border could be worry-free, so he could concentrate on dealing with the western war. He built trenches that extended in all directions and constructed extremely strong fortresses, which is what is known in the history of war as the "Hindenburg Line." The German army relied on this to confront the Allies for two years.</p>
<h3>Forced to Ceasefire</h3>
<p>On October 3, 1918, Hindenburg was called back to Berlin and consulted with the cabinet. He presented the true situation on the front lines. As a result, Germany proposed a ceasefire to the Allied countries. At that time, there were hundreds of thousands of troops on the front lines, and their morale was low. The slightest negligence would inevitably lead to a collapse. However, Hindenburg was able to calmly and unhurriedly lead the troops back to the country and hand them over to the revolutionary government for dispatch. This could not have been achieved without a mature and prudent person.</p>
<h3>Disbanded and Returned to the Countryside</h3>
<p>The following year, when the country's affairs were roughly settled, Hindenburg disbanded his troops and returned to the countryside to live a peaceful life. It was June 1919. Hindenburg was sincere and straightforward in his speech, and he was always disliked by "those in power." However, he never shirked his responsibilities. Hindenburg once wrote to President Ebert, "The signing of the peace treaty allows me to announce that since August 29, 1916, I have been responsible for all decisions and actions of the General Headquarters. All announcements and orders issued by the German Emperor regarding combat were issued on my advice and were my responsibility. Therefore, I request the President to inform the German people and the Allied governments of this declaration." Reading these words, one can see his heroic spirit.</p>
<h3>Reelected President</h3>
<p>In February 1925, President Ebert died. A primary election was held the following month. As a result, the right-wing parties knew that the presidential candidate Duaisberg was not an enemy of the candidate Marx, who was nominated by the Central Party, the Socialist Party, and the Democratic Party. They were worried. Navy Admiral Döenitz then proposed, "If we want to win the re-election, only the German 'elder' can come forward, and then we can be sure of victory." Who is the elder? That is General Hindenburg. The people agreed with this proposal, so Herr Bao set off for Hanover to persuade him to run. As soon as the news that Hindenburg had agreed to be a presidential candidate spread, the people turned pale with fear. Rumors spread, saying that this was the beginning of a restoration, and that even the Treaty of Versailles would not be enough to stop the revival of the imperial system. Even neighboring countries were worried and deeply concerned that military men in power would resume militarism and prepare for a new war.</p>
<p>A week before the presidential election, Hindenburg met with representatives of the German and foreign press in Hanover and solemnly declared that he was enjoying a leisurely life in retirement and had no other desires at the age of eighty. Now, he did not hesitate to become a "冯妇" again to take on difficult tasks, but only hoped to fulfill his responsibility to the motherland. He deeply hoped that his efforts to fulfill his responsibilities could serve as an example for the people of the country, and that Germany, which had been internally divided due to party strife, could be unified. As for the rumors that he was planning to reorganize the army to seek revenge, they were not credible. He had witnessed all kinds of tragedies during the World War, and these feelings and scenes would forever linger in his mind. He had spent half his life in the military, enduring hardships and dangers, and the thought of preparing for war and revenge had never entered his mind. Hindenburg revealed his inner thoughts with a solemn attitude and sincere words, moving the listeners and making them respect his great personality.</p>
<p>On April 26, 1925, Hindenburg received 14,639,399 votes and was elected as the second president of Germany.</p>
<h3>Dedicated to Peace</h3>
<p>Before taking office, there were two things that were surprising: Hindenburg asked State Councilor Dr. Meisner to stay in office, and he ordered then-Premier Luther to announce that he (Hindenburg) agreed with the cabinet's adherence to the Dawes Plan and the international integration plan discussed by the cabinet. Later, the Locarno Treaty was established because of this international integration plan.</p>
<h3>Abided by the Constitution</h3>
<p>On May 2, 1925, President Hindenburg held his inauguration ceremony. He swore allegiance to the Republic in a heavy voice. At that time, whether they were friends or enemies, they all knew that the new president had a noble personality and a strong religious faith. In his tenure, he would respect his oath and abide by the constitution. Indeed, during Hindenburg's long tenure, the people's love and admiration grew. Not only was republicanism not affected, as the people had initially worried, but even those who had hesitated to watch now eagerly supported it.</p>
<h3>Diligent in Governance</h3>
<p>Upon assuming the presidency, Hindenburg was already seventy-eight years old, yet he never slackened in his duties, nor ever showed signs of weariness. He attended to affairs punctually every day, maintaining the disciplined demeanor of a soldier. After arriving at the presidential residence, the director of the government intelligence office would report to him on the daily world events as recorded in the daily newspapers, which he would read for an hour. He would then receive various cabinet members, directors, and experts on public issues, inquiring about everything.</p>
<h3>Concern for the People's Suffering</h3>
<p>Hindenburg then resumed the established practice of touring the provinces in turn. Whenever he arrived at a place, he would meet with local officials and representatives of the people, asking about their hardships. In his speeches, he would earnestly advise them to eliminate partisan strife and unite.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Partisan Strife</h3>
<p>Hindenburg rarely intervened in political affairs, and when he did, he did not resort to harsh words or severe expressions. In 1926, after the fall of Luther's second cabinet, the leaders of various parties vied with each other over the allocation of positions in the new cabinet for several weeks without resolution. One day, Hindenburg summoned the leaders to the presidential residence, earnestly advising them. The conversation was as pleasant as a family gathering. Within a few days, Marx's second cabinet appeared before the parliament.</p>
<h3>Utter Impartiality</h3>
<p>Hindenburg did not compromise on matters of principle. In October 1926, during a major military exercise by the National Defense Force, the eldest son of the deposed crown prince secretly participated. Once the news was revealed, Hindenburg immediately investigated. Subsequently, General von Seeckt took responsibility and resigned. Although the general was highly regarded by Hindenburg, he accepted his resignation without hesitation.</p>
<h3>Far-sighted Vision</h3>
<p>Hindenburg's formal remarks often provoked international reactions. Prominent examples include his endorsement of the Locarno Treaties, his advocacy for Germany's entry into the League of Nations, and his denial that Germany was the instigator of World War I. This denial was made on September 18, 1927, at the thirteenth-anniversary commemoration of the Battle of Tannenberg in East Prussia. French newspapers interpreted this as Germany's spiritual failure to disarm.</p>
<h3>National Admiration</h3>
<p>October 2, 1927, marked President Hindenburg's eightieth birthday, and the entire nation celebrated enthusiastically. The people rejoiced. While Germans had previously received the respect of the populace, few could compare to the grand celebration Hindenburg received on this day. Prime Minister Marx, in his speech to the people, said, "President Hindenburg's impartiality and respect for the public good are truly a shining example for us." These words accurately represented the sentiment of the people. On that day, the people raised ten million marks as a "Hindenburg Fund," which Hindenburg generously allocated to aid those who had suffered in the war.</p>
<h3>Republican Consolidation</h3>
<p>As Hindenburg remained in office longer, those who had initially supported his ascension to power gradually distanced themselves from him, while the people and various republican parties increasingly trusted him. The German National People's Party, which had nominated Hindenburg as a presidential candidate, initially viewed him as a precursor to the restoration of the monarchy, but unexpectedly, after he took office, the foundation of the republic relied on his strength and became consolidated. In 1929, Hindenburg quarreled with his former political allies over an issue, creating a state of animosity, but Hindenburg ultimately remained unyielding and achieved his goals. Previously, the German National People's Party demanded a referendum to overturn the Young Plan for reparations. Hindenburg believed that the primary purpose of this proposal was to undermine the policy of Foreign Minister Stresemann, whose policies were supported by Hindenburg, and whose talent and knowledge were particularly admired by Hindenburg. Therefore, Hindenburg resolutely announced to the nation his opposition to the demand for a referendum. Several weeks before the vote, Stresemann fell ill and passed away. On the day of the funeral, Hindenburg walked in the procession, holding the rope of the coffin, to show his respect. Although the vote was held, it required the support of eleven million votes to overturn the Young Plan, but the people's love for Hindenburg resulted in a shortfall of more than six million votes.</p>
<h3>Elected Three Times</h3>
<p>In April 1932, President Hindenburg was re-elected, receiving 19,359,642 votes. His competitors were Mr. Hitler, who received 13,417,460 votes, and the Communist candidate, Mr. Thälmann, who received 3,706,388 votes.</p>
<p>President Hindenburg was a strict observer of the constitution. His handling of national affairs was based on the principle of legality, and he regarded Kaiser Wilhelm I, the creator of the German Empire, as his model. He often referred to his cabinet members as "my state officials." This did not imply that cabinet members were merely his tools, nor did he intend to drive them like his servants. Since the cabinet members were appointed by him, he especially wanted to regard them as confidants. In fact, Hindenburg never acted without consulting the relevant cabinet members.</p>
<h3>Lifetime Hobbies</h3>
<p>Hindenburg had few hobbies, but he enjoyed hunting. Every summer, he would go to the Dietramszell plateau in Bavaria for a month, engaging in hunting. Recently, he built a villa in Neudeck, where he would rest with his grandchildren during his spare time. (Reuters)</p>
<h3>International Impressions of Hindenburg's Death Austria Believes Germany Will Enter a New Era, Worried About Political Turmoil</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The death of President Hindenburg has aroused deep impressions in Austria. Austrians have always respected him, but they regard his death as the end of an era in German history. The issue of who will succeed the German president is closely related to Austria. Austrians are quite concerned about the potential for turmoil in the German situation. The immediate reaction of responsible figures in France upon hearing the news of Hindenburg's death was to deeply admire the strength of a great military and political figure of his generation. His prestige as a pillar of the nation was particularly praised. Although officials in Paris acknowledged that Hindenburg's death would have significant political implications, they declined to comment on the matter. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>French Press Observes Future of German Political Situation The Actions of the National Defense Force, Having Lost its Leader, are Worthy of Attention</h3>
<p>(Paris) The "Morning Post" published a military dispatch from its Berlin correspondent, Barre, discussing the relationship between President Hindenburg's death and the German political situation. It stated that the main political forces in Germany can be divided into two factions: one is the traditional conservative faction, and the other is the radical National Socialist faction. National Socialism is a product of economic panic and the chanting of unrealistic slogans. Currently, the conservatives are greatly repelling the radicals of National Socialism, and the outcome is uncertain. The conservatives have always regarded President Hindenburg as their leader. Now that Hindenburg has passed away, will the conservatives immediately disintegrate? Not necessarily. The National Defense Force has a strong influence in Germany, and Hindenburg was the leader respected by the National Defense Force, and the figure who spoke for the National Defense Force. Now that he has passed away, will the influence of the National Defense Force not be frustrated? After Hindenburg's death, Hitler will become the only pillar in German politics. The National Defense Force, without support, will it make an unexpected concession to Hitler? Will this concession further cause Hitler to make concessions to the radicals in the National Socialist Party and accept some of their demands? All of this must be determined in the next few days. Some people predict that the National Defense Force and the right wing will support a figure of the same faction to succeed as president, but now these people seem to no longer be able to firmly believe in the lessons, because there is currently no such figure who is competent for the important task. Even if there is, there is a lack of support. The June 30th terrorist incident is still fresh in their minds and difficult to forget. As for the successor to the presidency being a candidate supported by Hitler, there is no doubt. And the most likely among the candidates is Hitler himself, etc. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Rise and Fall of Nazi Party Strength Stormtroopers Greatly Reduced Internal Purge Quite Difficult</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Nazi Party's Brownshirt Stormtroopers, since the June 30th incident, have been ordered to take a one-month leave from August 1st. During the vacation, members are not allowed to wear uniforms. This order expired today, but there are still very few people wearing brown uniforms on the streets today. It can be seen that although stormtroopers have obtained permission to wear uniforms, their enthusiasm has been greatly reduced. The internal reorganization of the stormtroopers was originally scheduled to be completed on August 1st, but now it has just begun, because internal purges are very difficult and not easy to resolve. Stormtroopers must all be members of the Nazi Party. The stormtroopers currently have 3 million members, which will now be reduced to the same number of members as at the beginning of 1933, that is, reduced to 1 million. At present, the economic and social crisis is rampant, and it is difficult to settle the 2 million young people who have been rejected, which is a great loss to the Nazi Party. In short, after this purge, the Nazi Party has greatly reduced its glory and has only managed to retreat and protect its original position before Hitler came to power. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>European War Commemoration Germans Do Not Forget Past Humiliations</h3>
<p>(Berlin) August 1, 1914, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany issued a general mobilization order and invaded Belgium, marking the beginning of the European War. Today marks the 20th anniversary. The German National Defense Force held an unveiling ceremony for the war memorial in Berlin's Unter den Linden Street. The public expressed warm sympathy to the National Defense Force. Troops raised national flags in front of the memorial, played military music, and marched in formation. Onlookers gathered and cheered for the troops. Newspapers published special articles to commemorate the event. The "Stormtrooper" commented that twenty years ago, some people used various means to sow the seeds of chaos in order to slander and suppress Germany. In fact, Germany needs nothing but to protect its honor and independence, and it is still the same today. Today, the people of the whole country should rise up and resist again the means used twenty years ago. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today is the 20th anniversary of the European War, and all German newspapers are paying close attention to it. In addition to expressing respect for the millions of soldiers who sacrificed and shed blood for the country, newspapers also published photos of the start of the war on August 2, 1914. At that time, all of Europe sang military songs, participated in four years of bloody battles, and inspired the spirit of sacrifice, and recalled the enthusiasm of Germany's general mobilization day. Berlin newspapers unanimously praised the soldiers who died in battle and the indomitable spirit of Germany in 1914 in prominent positions, and published photos of soldiers wearing iron helmets, followed by the following numbers: 12 million people fought for Germany, 1.803 million died for Germany, 4.064 million were wounded for Germany, and 616,000 were captured for Germany.

<h3>Austrian Cabinet Officially Condemns Germany for Secretly Conspiring to Incite Rebellion Austrian Government Begins Purging Nazi Party New Prime Minister and Others to Visit Mussolini Baben's Appointment as Envoy to Austria Has Not Yet Been Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>Vienna Today, Austria officially condemned Germany for secretly aiding the Austrian rebellion a week ago for the first time. The Austrian cabinet approved the publication of a document stating that weeks before the rebellion, Germany had secretly sent a strategy to Austria to guide the Austrian Social Democratic Party. A person was arrested in Upper Austria, and secret documents were found in his shoes, all of which were strategies for civil war.</p>
<p>An official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet made a decision on whether to accept Baben as Hitler's special envoy to Vienna, and had not made any public statements to the press about this matter.</p>
<p>It is heard that the new Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Deputy Prime Minister Starhemberg will go to Italy soon. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Vienna It was previously reported that the new Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Deputy Prime Minister Starhemberg will jointly go to Italy to visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Today, it has been officially confirmed, but the date of departure has not yet been determined. (National News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Vienna The Austrian government has begun to purge the Austrian Social Democratic Party at home and abroad. Yesterday, several places in the capital were searched. The residence of the former ambassador to Italy, Mr. Rintelen, was also among them. It is said that a list of the new cabinet to be organized after the success of the rebellion was found. The names of the famous General Bardolff and General Wager were both found in the documents of the rebel party. Rintelen's injury is gradually recovering. Mr. Rintelen declared that he intends to tell the authorities everything he knows about the rebellion. If so, some Austrians with a well-established reputation will not be able to gain a foothold in Austria. The authorities have taken various precautions based on what Mr. Rintelen has told them. Nine members of the Internal Defense Force searched the residence of Baron Hahn, the representative of the German official news agency in Vienna, yesterday. They took the telephone in his hand and pointed a pistol directly at Mr. Hahn, ordering him to explain the relationship between Munich and the Austrian Nazi Party's recent rebellion. However, Mr. Hahn could not explain anything. Berlin has protested strongly against this action, saying that the Internal Defense Force's unauthorized search was illegal. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>The capital of Yugoslavia Recently, another 335 Nazi Party members fled into the Valachia region of Yugoslavia and were detained. The Nazi Party rebels fought fiercely with the Austrian Internal Defense Force near Lavamünd for three and a half days. Afterwards, the official army arrived with heavy artillery and hand grenades and other fierce military equipment. As a result, the rebels collapsed and retreated into Yugoslavia in 18 buses, 12 freight cars, and 6 cars, and carried 400 rifles, 6 machine guns, 500 bayonets, 60,000 rounds of rifle ammunition, and machine gun bullets, which were all confiscated by the Yugoslav authorities. The authorities also ordered all the swastikas on the shoulders of the deserters to be removed. So far, a total of 901 Nazi Party members have fled into Yugoslavia. (Havas, 1st)</p>

<p>Rischon According to news from here today, Mrs. Dollfuss and her two children will now go to Rome to see the Pope. Her children are all young and had not heard of their father's death. One day, Mrs. Dollfuss called her children from Vienna. Her youngest daughter opened her mouth and asked: "Will mother return with father?" After this question was asked, the phone was silent, and then tears were heard. The daughter then cried loudly and said: "My father must be dead and will never return!" (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>The Situation Between Japan and Russia is Urgent</h3>
<p>Aircraft Reconnaissance and Moving Boundary Stones</p>
<p>False Protests Rejected by Russia</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Continue to Arrest Russian Personnel</p>
<p>Disrupting the Administration of the Eastern Railway</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Soviet side deliberately moved the 17th and 18th border markers between Suifenhe and Dongning in Russia-Manchukuo into Manchurian territory, and Soviet secret police ordered Manchurians residing near the 17th marker to leave immediately. Shi Luben, the negotiator of the "Manchukuo" Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Harbin, based on the instructions of the government, demanded that the Soviet Consul General Slavitsky promptly stop the aggressive behavior, and at the same time announced the reservation of the right to restore the moved border markers to their original positions. (Dentsu, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Soviet Consul General Slavitsky visited Shi Luben, the negotiator of the "Manchukuo" Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Harbin, on the 31st and rejected "Manchukuo's" protest, saying that the issue of Soviet aircraft crossing the border in the direction of Boly and the incident of Soviet soldiers crossing the border in the direction of Manchuli were both groundless. (Dentsu, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Soviet side rejected "Manchukuo's" protest, saying that it was groundless. The "Manchukuo" Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement yesterday: "The Soviet side's denial of "Manchukuo's" protest regarding the aircraft crossing the border is a deception of "Manchukuo". If this insincere attitude leads to disputes, the responsibility will fall entirely on the Soviet Union, and as a result, "Manchukuo" will inevitably take self-defense measures." (Dentsu, 2nd)</p>
<p>Boli It has been reported here that Japanese military police recently arrested more than 2,000 Russian personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway at Pogranichnaya and other stations. The reasons are unknown. According to reliable sources, large-scale arrests of Russian staff and workers of the Eastern Railway are being prepared as part of an overall plan to disrupt the work of the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway. This plan has recently been enthusiastically implemented by the Japanese and White Guards, such as preventing freight transport, destroying trains, banditry, and unreasonable arrests. Recently, floods have flooded the entire newly built railway in Manchuria by the Japanese, and some goods are being transported by the Chinese Eastern Railway regardless of the local government's attempts to prevent it. Therefore, this provocative destructive action is becoming increasingly tense. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to a telegram received by the pseudo-Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian-Manchukuo waterway conference in Heihe on the 30th of last month discussed the establishment of a joint Soviet-Manchukuo technical committee as the central issue. As a result of the discussion, both sides were very close, and another preparatory contact was made. The official meeting is scheduled to be held on the 3rd. (Dentsu, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Telegram Suspends Red Army Exercise, Releases Poison Gas</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At a time when Soviet aircraft are frequently appearing near Manchuli and their active military actions are worthy of attention, a telegram received from a certain place on the 2nd stated that at about 2:00 p.m. on July 15, Soviet aircraft suddenly attacked Huma County, about 60 li upstream of the Aigun River along the Aigun River, and spread a gas similar to poison gas, causing about 150 of the 400 residents in the area to suffer from diseases of the throat and nasal cavity, difficulty breathing, incessant coughing, pain in the chest, and fever ranging from 38 to 40 degrees Celsius, and bedridden for three to seven days. According to an investigation by Manchurian officials, it is feared that Russian aircraft were conducting poison gas exercises on the border, so the Manchurian side attaches great importance to the situation.

<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota Convenes Meeting of Ambassadors</h3>
<p>Exchange of Opinions on So-Called Harmonious Diplomacy</p>
<p>Ambassador Sato Reports on the Current Situation in Europe</p>
<p>Deeply Wary of Soviet Diplomatic Maneuvers (Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota wants to take advantage of the Disarmament Conference to practically apply the diplomatic policy of harmony among all nations, which was confirmed by the new cabinet's Five-Minister Conference. Therefore, he ordered Ambassador Saito stationed in the United States, Ambassador Sato stationed in France, Ambassador Matsushima stationed in Italy, and Counselor Gu of the "Manchukuo" Embassy to return home and hold a meeting of ambassadors abroad in Japan. Regarding issues in Manchuria, the home country, and Europe, opinions will be exchanged from a free standpoint and from a professional perspective, and various means of implementing the basic principles of the actual movement will be reviewed again. A concrete plan will be drafted in mid-September. When Ambassadors Saito and Sato return to their posts, they will take this plan with them to deal with the disarmament preparatory consultations.

<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Sato, who returned from France yesterday, visited Foreign Minister Hirota at 4:00 p.m. after landing and reported on the general situation in Europe and the attitudes of Britain, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union towards the Disarmament Conference after tendering his resignation. The content of Ambassador Sato's report is as follows: (1) Due to Germany's work to annex Austria, the confrontation between Germany and Italy has intensified, and the crisis in Central Europe lies in this. (1) European countries hope for the success of the Eastern Pact proposed by the French Foreign Minister, especially after the Geneva Disarmament Conference failed due to Germany's strong demand for equal rights to armaments. However, France wants to win over the Soviet Union due to its relationship with Germany, while Italy wants to win over Germany, creating a state of confrontation. Furthermore, France and Italy do not adopt an active attitude towards the Disarmament Conference, which makes the situation even more complicated. (1) What Japan should be wary of is the success of the Soviet Union's work in Europe. The basis of this work is to first establish peace with Europe, and then turn its attention to the Far East. This is the Soviet Union's traditional ambition, and this ambition has been openly recognized by Europe. (Japan United News, 2nd)</p>

Therefore, the meeting between the two is of great significance. (Dentsu, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Northeast Volunteer Army Attacks Japanese Military Vehicle</h3>
<p>Explosives Detonate, Vehicles Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Japanese Casualties Reach More Than Ten</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 5:30 a.m. this morning, a Japanese military vehicle was attacked by the Volunteer Army at a location 5 kilometers northwest of the Yakune station (northwest of Yimianpo) because the tracks were destroyed. Although the driver saw it from afar and knew it, he stopped the car, but it was too late. The locomotive and several other vehicles derailed. The Volunteer Army ambushed nearby launched a fierce attack. After a fierce battle with the Japanese and puppet troops, the Japanese suffered more than a dozen casualties, and the puppet troops suffered five deaths and three injuries. The most remarkable thing about this attack was that the Volunteer Army seemed to know that there was a bomb car attached to the rear of the train, and gathered their guns to launch a fierce attack, causing the bomb to explode and everything to be destroyed. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the Volunteer Army retreated to the rear. The attacked train, No. 92, has been attacked by the Volunteer Army five times. The Japanese call it the "Devil Train." (China United Press, 2nd)</p>

<h3>American Naval Secretary Swanson Advocates Universal Disarmament by 20 Percent</h3>
<p>Firmly Opposes Abandoning Current Naval Ratios</p>
<p>American Border Defense Encompasses All Territories</p>
<p>Japanese Navy Expresses Opposition</p>
<p>(Washington) Naval Secretary Swanson declared today, advocating that naval powers universally reduce naval armaments by 20 percent. However, he simultaneously stated that he firmly opposes abandoning the 5:5:3 naval ratio among Britain, America, and Japan. The Naval Secretary issued this declaration to the Associated Press, apparently in response to Japanese Prime Minister Okada's naval disarmament remarks on Tuesday. Swanson asserted that abandoning the existing naval ratio would lead to an unknown bottom. Therefore, his disarmament proposal must be universally implemented by all major naval powers, and all armaments must be reduced equally. However, this is his personal opinion and cannot be taken as the official attitude of the US government at next year's naval conference. The final policy of the United States will be decided by President Roosevelt. However, Swanson firmly believes that the United States should refuse to change the existing battleship ratio. If the signatories of the London Treaty do not unanimously agree to an equal disarmament, then his proposal will not be put forward. If all countries agree, he will propose decommissioning old ships and limiting the construction of new ships. By 1936, the United States will have three battleships exceeding their age limit. Currently, only one Dreadnought battleship has exceeded its age limit. Swanson indicated that this universal reduction proposal could be put to the test at next year's naval conference. If countries are interested in proceeding, he may propose a disarmament of 25 to 30 percent. Regarding British Acting Prime Minister Baldwin's statement in the House of Commons that Britain's border has been extended to the Rhine River due to aircraft, Swanson said, "The border of the United States encompasses all territories. Although we have no aggressive ambitions, we are determined to defend ourselves to the best of our ability." (1st National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In response to Japanese Prime Minister Okada's statement, US Naval Secretary Swanson strongly advocated reinforcing and perpetuating the ratio system, stating that he is prepared to reduce armaments by 20% after obtaining the approval of various countries. The Japanese Navy Ministry's opinion on this matter is as follows: The United States, which initiated the world's premier navalism at the Washington and London conferences, naturally hopes for the continuation of existing treaties. However, Japan's position is to contend for the equal right to national defense, which obstructs the self-confidence of inferior naval powers and is an internationally accepted principle. Therefore, we must say that changes should be made. On the other hand, the 20% reduction plan is the same as the one-third reduction advocated by former President Hoover. Because it is based on the nation's own position and is based on ratios, Japan absolutely disagrees. (2nd Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>United States Strengthens Pacific Defenses</h3>
<p>New Floating Dry Dock to Be Established</p>
<p>Panama Canal Defenses Also Need to Be Increased</p>
<p>San Pedro, USA. Secretary of War Dern returned today from inspecting the defenses of the Panama Canal and feels that the defenses there need to be strengthened immediately. Dern and several senior military officers inspected the canal zone for two weeks. Today, he declared that in order to make the defense force sufficient, it is necessary to increase troops, anti-aircraft guns, and aircraft. Furthermore, because the canal zone is important to the overall national defense of the United States, it must be carried out immediately. Dern hopes that the next Congress can approve an increase in troop strength from 110,000 to 165,000. Dern will travel to the Pacific coast again in the coming months to inspect and plans to visit Honolulu. Dern said that if US troops withdraw from the Philippines, it will be necessary to increase the strength of the garrison in Honolulu and strengthen defenses along the Pacific coast, and the War Department must prepare for this.

<p>(Washington) Recently, due to the serious situation in Europe, Chief of Naval Operations Standley suggested to President Roosevelt that only the main fleet should be transferred to the Pacific, while the remaining light fleet should remain in the Atlantic, as the light fleet is specifically for protecting maritime commerce. Although US government officials have refused to comment on British Acting Prime Minister Baldwin's statement in the House of Commons that the British border is on the Rhine, they are deeply convinced that the Anglo-French alliance still exists and that its strength is the same as when Germany invaded Belgium 20 years ago. (1st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Vinson Naval Act stipulates that 1,184 naval aircraft should be built to increase the total number of aircraft to 2,184.

Therefore, it has been decided that the number of naval aircraft to be built by 1942 will be reduced from 1,184 to 910. (1st Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Imminent Collapse of the Sichuan Bandits</h3>
<p>Their military is trapped in a tight encirclement, their politics are mere theatrics, driving the people to war will inevitably lead to an unmanageable situation. Chengdu Air Dispatch: Recently, the Sichuan bandits have been surrounded on three sides by the Sichuan army, retreating to a corner, dreaming daily of breaking through the encirclement, but ultimately their plans are exhausted and their strength depleted, at a complete loss. Those in Wanyuan are heavily blocked by five or six routes, suffering heavy casualties. Those in northern Tongjiang are met with fierce attacks by three or four routes and the general reserve forces of Pan and Peng, suffering deep wounds. Those in western Tongjiang are again controlled by the first and second route armies. If all routes can consistently exert their strength to suppress the bandits, the annihilation of the communists is only a matter of time. It is recently learned that a certain high-ranking military officer of the 21st Army's Provisional First Division, Chang Han's unit, sent a letter to his friend, detailing his unit's experiences during the march and the general situation of the bandits' military and political work in Tongjiang. It is extremely detailed and recorded here for reference by those concerned about the bandit situation. The letter is as follows: "Brother, I first traveled to Shun, then via Guangyue to Qu, all by car. These counties have been affected by the communist disaster and the prevalence of natural disasters, and food is quite scarce. Our troops are all traveling with their own provisions. Rice is worth six or seven yuan per斗(a unit of dry volume, about 10 liters), and it still feels like having money but no market. The cries of the hungry are everywhere, and the starving corpses fill the roads. Fortunately, the planting this year is still good. If the harvest is good, there may be a slight chance of recovery after the autumn harvest. From Li Fuxi (under the jurisdiction of Qu, 40 li from Qu) to Baiyian (under the jurisdiction of Sui), it is a bandit area. It was only recovered from the previous year to February of this year. Not only is there no food left, but many refugees have not returned. The fields are barren, the houses are broken and dilapidated, and it is unbearable to look at. From Jiangkou to Yuanshanchang (under the jurisdiction of Ba), nine out of ten houses are empty, and the scene of destruction is indescribable. From Sanxikou (under the jurisdiction of Tong) to Tongjiang City, a total of 70 li, is also the most recently recovered area, with very few people. This time, our division was ordered to take over the defense of Fan's and Zhou Liao's two brigades. On the 25th of last month, we arrived at Tongcheng. The division headquarters arrived three days later. The bandits retreated to the back mountain of the city, the Yindingbao Yinglong Mountain area, which is only one or two li from the city. Fortresses face each other, and the city is under their surveillance. Our division sent a part of the troops to cross the river and deploy key positions inside and outside the city, and another part to guard our bank and control everything. To the left of the city is Li's unit of the Third Route, and to the left of our bank is Yang's unit of the Fourth Route. They have been properly deployed and will soon attack and wipe out these bandits. Brother, yesterday I crossed the river to inspect the city. The main streets were burned down by the bandits, leaving a scorched earth with rubble everywhere. All the remaining houses only have frames, and furniture and utensils are abandoned everywhere. The bandits' excrement and filth are everywhere, and the stench is overwhelming. The bandits built two air-raid shelters in the park north of the city, which can accommodate about three or four hundred people. Only a few thousand old and weak people remain in the city, and all the young and strong have been coerced away. The bandits dug a salt well under the Guanyin Pavilion, which is said to produce a small amount of salt. Our division captured a well digger yesterday. According to him, there are several wells dug, but few produce salt. Each ounce of salt is worth 15,000 cash. According to the locals, the bandits have killed about 200,000 people in Tongcheng. There are dozens of corpse pits at the foot of the mountain north of the city and on the river dam, each with dozens to hundreds of people. Brother, yesterday I saw a corpse pit on the river dam that was exposed by the water, with dozens of skeletons of men, women, and children. The locals' words are probably not false. Yesterday, the bandits sent more than 20 members of the Boy Scout Regiment to swim across the river to scout military intelligence. Eight of them were captured by us (all 11 or 12 years old). After interrogation, they all told the truth and have been sent to the rear for surveillance. These are the general situations seen and heard in the past two weeks. It has been more than a year since Tongjiang fell into the hands of the bandits. It is the base of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Soviet. At first, I thought that they would have great plans and organization for local construction, public training, politics, and economics. Now, having personally experienced the place and conducted a detailed investigation, their political aspects are limited to written propaganda, slogans, leaflets, and inscriptions, which are everywhere. However, the goals and plans listed have not been realized. The accusations against the government troops are purely fabricated and cannot be trusted by the people. Their vulgarity is even more ridiculous. The local intellectuals are either killed or exiled, and most of the remaining people are illiterate. Who can understand their slogans? In terms of economy, the absorption of cash and the issuance of banknotes have also been blocked by the government troops and cannot be circulated. However, trade has not been abolished, and the people feel deeply inconvenienced. As for the distribution of land, it has not yet been implemented. To this day, there are barren fields everywhere, which is clear evidence of this. The concentration of grain has also not been achieved. The grain obtained by the people is often privately stored and cannot be fully collected. Now that our army has arrived here, we can still buy miscellaneous grains, which shows the general situation. In terms of public organization, although there are Soviet organizations at all levels in urban and rural areas, most people disagree on the surface except for a few ruffians. Even the family system has not been fundamentally destroyed. The census is also not strict. Many natives cannot escape far and hide in the barren mountains of their own territory, returning early and leaving late. As for construction, there is nothing to be seen in Tongcheng except for a Soviet bank and a school. The content is extremely simple. Their entire energy is focused on military affairs. Everything else is just following the old stories to paralyze the people. In addition, the words 'The Soviet is our motherland' are embedded in stones on the park road, which is ironclad proof of their ruining the motherland. Who would believe that they can achieve great things with such absurd and rebellious propositions and disorganized steps? However, it is heard that they are extremely cunning in military affairs, but it is nothing more than creating terror through severe punishments and laws to exploit them for a while. Driving the people to war (once it collapses, it will inevitably become unmanageable). (National News Agency)"</p>

<h3>Letter from Ye Muhan's Father</h3>
<p>Reporting the unfair verdict of the Japanese court</p>
<p>The part concerning compensation for the bereaved was rejected</p>
<p>Ye Muhan, a Chinese student in Japan, was previously killed by a Japanese student in Nagasaki. Recently, the Japanese court has sentenced the defendant to imprisonment for two to seven years. However, the Japanese court refused to accept the part concerning the bereaved family's request for compensation. Recently, Ye Xiuyi, Ye's father, sent a letter from Nagasaki reporting the case's progress. The transcript is as follows:</p>
<p>To all agencies, organizations, and newspapers at home and abroad, with respect, on May 24 of this year, my fourth son, Muhan, was premeditatedly murdered by Watanabe Nobuyoshi, a student at Nagasaki Trade and Commercial School in Japan. Thanks to the Central Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the ambassadors and consuls stationed in Japan, and various organizations at home and abroad, upholding justice for my deceased</p>
<h3>Ye Muhan, murdered by a Japanese student</h3>
<p>son, shedding light on his grievances, both in life and death, I am deeply grateful for your kindness. Unexpectedly, the Japanese court biasedly listened to the one-sided statement of the perpetrator (Watanabe Nobuyoshi). On July 11, the prosecutor requested a sentence of three to seven years in prison in the public trial in court. On July 20, the judge reported a sentence of two to seven years, subject to juvenile criminal law. The exact number of years has not been clearly determined. Destroying the sacred law and making an unfair judgment. The request for compensation for the bereaved was also rejected. In this situation, my deceased son's grievances will never be redressed. It is a small matter, but the future is long. The lives and property of our overseas Chinese residing here are truly in danger. In addition to filing a private lawsuit for compensation for the bereaved, I fear that it will be rejected again or wrongly judged by the dark court. Therefore, I hereby send a letter to your newspaper, urging all sectors to unanimously advocate and urge the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to quickly make a serious protest to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Compensation for the bereaved will be met with gratitude from the living and repayment in the afterlife. I present my case with tears in my eyes and earnestly hope for your help. Ye Xiuyi, July 29, 23rd year of the Republic"</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain in Shandong Province, River Flooding and Breaches</h3>
<p>The Construction Department Sends Personnel for Investigation</p>
<p>The Yellow River Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: For the past ten days, the heavy rain has not stopped, mountain floods have erupted, and all rivers have reported rising water levels. The Grand Canal within the territory of Liaocheng has already experienced danger. The Zhaoniu River and Dengjin River in Yucheng, northern Shandong, also breached during the heavy rain the day before yesterday. Because the upstream and downstream of the Zhaoniu River are both in Yucheng, and the middle stream is in Qihe County, this year the Construction Department ordered the counties to excavate the Zhaoniu River. Yucheng excavated the upstream and downstream of the river, while Qihe has not yet started construction. Therefore, the Zhaoniu River swelled greatly during the heavy rain. Because the middle stream of Qihe was blocked, it could not be discharged, so it overflowed and caused a disaster. First, the Zhaoniu River backflowed. On the 27th, the western embankment of the Dengjin River breached at Zhujiadaokou, with a breach width of about one zhang (approximately 3.3 meters). The autumn crops along the river were flooded, covering an area of about 40 qing (approximately 26.7 hectares). On the 28th, it was still raining heavily. The Zhaoniu River breached again at Xiejiarukou, and the disaster area became even larger. The county magistrate of the county, Zhang Yuliang, and the Ninth District Water Conservancy Commissioner, Wang Zuhuai, telegraphed reports to the Construction Department one after another, and requested that Qihe be ordered to quickly excavate the middle stream of the Zhaoniu River to facilitate drainage. The Construction Department dispatched technician Yao Xintian to Liaocheng and Meng Xianzheng to Yucheng today (31st) to investigate and find ways to dredge the river to avoid flooding.</p>
<p>Today (31st), all sections of the Yellow River are rising. According to the telegram from the Shaanxi Hydrological Station received by the River Affairs Bureau, the upper reaches of the Yellow River have slightly risen, with a water level of 291.25 meters, which is 4 centimeters higher than yesterday. As for the water levels of the various sections within the province, they are as follows: Lisheng Village rose 3.3 centimeters, water level 58.87 meters; Guanzhuang rose 3.5 centimeters, water level 34.77 meters; Luokou rose 1.4 centimeters, water level 29.47 meters; Xiezhi Bay rose 1.3 centimeters, water level 17.83 meters; Dama Village rose 5 centimeters, water level 13.25 meters.

<h3>Speech by Yang Yongtai, Secretary-General of the Jiangxi Garrison Headquarters (Continued)</h3>
<p>New Life Movement and the Four Cardinal Principles</p>
<p>(3) "Whether the Four Cardinal Principles can be regarded as a panacea for saving the nation should be determined by whether the medicine is suitable for the illness. Although the current condition of China is very complex, tracing the source of the illness reveals that it is mostly caused by ignorance of the Four Cardinal Principles. Therefore, our main prescription is to repeatedly use the four ingredients of the Four Cardinal Principles for a long time, without arbitrarily adding or subtracting them, and especially not mixing them with Western medicine." This is the third answer. To answer this question, the most important thing is to first analyze the meaning and function of the Four Cardinal Principles clearly, and then carefully examine the existing condition of China to find out how many symptoms there are, which symptoms are caused by ignorance of the Four Cardinal Principles, and which symptoms are caused by lack of integrity. By comparing them, the causal relationship will be very close and clear.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in his outline of the New Life Movement, defined the Four Cardinal Principles, saying that "Propriety" is a respectful attitude, "Righteousness" is proper conduct, "Integrity" is clear discernment, and "Shame" is a sincere realization. This is still a very abstract statement. In the "New Life Guidelines," he analyzes it more concretely. I will now extend his meaning separately and also examine the condition of China separately.</p>
<p>1. "What is Propriety? Respect and courtesy are the main principles, abiding by the law and following reason, being cautious in all matters, having a harmonious and solemn appearance, being good at getting along with others, being filial to parents and respectful to elders, and fulfilling ethical norms." From this, we can see that what we call "Propriety" is by no means just about rituals. Many people think that bowing, kowtowing, shaking hands, and making a bow are Propriety, and that they have exhausted the means of Propriety. This is a big mistake. Some people also think that talking about ancient Propriety is not as practical and effective as talking about modern law. But this only sees one side of the matter, not knowing that the function of Propriety is active, while the function of law is still passive. Propriety comes first, and law comes last. Confucius said on politics: "Guide them with policies and regulate them with punishments, and the people will avoid wrongdoing but have no sense of shame. Guide them with virtue and regulate them with Propriety, and they will have a sense of shame and moreover become good." It can be seen that the effect of Propriety is above the effect of law. Moreover, Propriety maintains society by preventing chaos before it happens, while law sanctions society by stopping chaos after it happens. Propriety is like a police officer, and law is like a prosecutor. For example, if two people are about to fight, the police will intervene and persuade them, always preventing criminal offenses from happening in society. If individuals in society can police themselves, the application of criminal law will naturally be reduced. In the whole society, a land of Propriety will naturally be formed. Therefore, Propriety is entirely the way to stop disputes and violence. Now, China is in chaos everywhere, with nothing but strife, noise, presumption, crudeness, romance, negligence, and even rebellion and lawlessness. It is called a land of Propriety, but in reality, it lacks Propriety. Maintaining social order cannot always rely on after-the-fact sanctions. The effectiveness of law is sometimes exhausted. If Propriety can become a custom, then society will naturally have a noble authority. In an environment of Propriety, if someone violates Propriety, it will be more shameful than breaking the law, and they will be subject to invisible sanctions from conscience and society. Conversely, people who have Propriety will be respected by society. If the whole society knows how to observe Propriety, then all sources of chaos will naturally disappear without a trace. What we call "Propriety," in the most modern terms, is to emphasize order, abide by discipline, respect superiors, and have a solemn appearance. Whether in self-cultivation, dealing with others, or handling affairs, we must be upright and respectful.</p>
<p>2. "What is Righteousness? To wholeheartedly help the world, be generous to others and strict with oneself, not fight for rights, be selfless in serving the public, not refuse hard work, support good and eliminate evil to manifest justice." Looking at the opposite of the word "Righteousness," we see "Profit." The reason why China today is beyond redemption is selfishness and self-interest. Everyone takes familism as their starting point, and everything is calculated for their own interests, forgetting Righteousness when they see profit. All evils are born from this, and all public affairs are not handled well. This is the root cause, so "Righteousness" is what China needs most now. Our interpretation of the word "Righteousness," if we use modern terms, "wholeheartedly helping the world" means having compassion for society, such as advocating righteous actions, running public welfare, destroying families to relieve difficulties, sharing with each other, helping each other, and supporting each other in times of illness. "Selfless in serving the public and not refusing hard work" means having a sense of responsibility to the country. "Generous to others and strict with oneself, not fighting for rights" means being humble and yielding, which is also what Western philosophers call altruism is self-interest. "Supporting good and eliminating evil to manifest justice" means "chivalry," such as helping those in need. All of these are qualities that modern citizens must have, but our society is declining, and it is the opposite, lacking the virtue of Righteousness.</p>
<p>3. "What is Integrity? To be clear and clean, strict in taking and giving, having integrity, distinguishing right from wrong, resisting fallacies, and advocating frugality to cherish resources." The meaning of Integrity has three aspects: clarity, cleanliness, and frugality. In terms of cleanliness, it means not taking anything improperly, not even a small thing. In terms of clarity, it means upholding the truth of right and wrong, not blindly following, not making trouble. In terms of frugality, it means cherishing resources and treating public and private matters equally. The biggest diseases of our country today are greed and selfishness, and making trouble. Corruption is rampant, bribery is rampant. People give and take without restraint, have no sense of right and wrong, and have no distinction between good and evil. For any political or social proposition, whether opposing or supporting it; for any person, whether supporting or overthrowing them, most of them are due to the activation of selfish motives and have some prejudice. Or it is because of the relationship between closeness and distance, only relying on emotional impulses to follow or disobey, or it is delusional to find a way out, to speculate and take advantage of opportunities, or it is deliberately making trouble to coerce rights. It has come to a point where it has completely become a society without right and wrong, without good and evil, and without justice. How can the world not be in great chaos? Officials who are known for their corruption escape the law and live leisurely lives, and are still flattered by many people. It is clear that individual rights are not considered, and people are only indulging in emotional disputes, but there are still many people who echo them. The most recent and prominent example is Chen Mingshu's organization of the People's Government, destroying the party and harming the country, changing the flag and changing the year, and rebelling against the central government. If the central government is right, then they are wrong, and the people should support the central government to eliminate the Fujian government. If they are right, then the central government is wrong, and the people can also sympathize with the Fujian government to attack the central government. However, before the central government used troops against Fujian, many intellectuals and important figures vigorously advocated mediation, thinking that compromise was the best option. Such ambiguous and confusing claims were actually put forward, and society did not find it strange. This is truly rewarding evil and brewing chaos, and the result is only bad luck for the general public. Therefore, the bad consequences caused by lack of clarity are the same as lack of cleanliness, or even worse. What is frugality? In terms of government offices, the general staff do not cherish public property and arbitrarily abuse public funds, as if they have no personal pain. There are even those who use public office for private gain, which is common. In terms of individuals, the upper and middle classes are mostly indulging in extravagance, gambling, and consuming resources, not considering the national economy as a whole, leading to the rich becoming poorer and the poor becoming poorer.</p>
<p>4. "What is Shame? To have a sense of shame and aversion, not to be willing to be humble and filthy, to respect oneself, not to be willing to be abandoned, to strive for progress, not to seek temporary survival, and to rather die than resist insults." The meaning of Shame has two aspects: seeing others doing evil, one should deeply hate and denounce it; realizing that one has done evil, one should be ashamed of it. Combining shame and aversion is called Shame. The nature of Shame is like an engine, and Propriety, Righteousness, and Integrity are like a machine. Therefore, people start with Shame and then understand Integrity, practice Righteousness, and manifest Propriety. If a person has no Shame, then there is no evil that they will not do, and there is nothing that they will not do. Therefore, among the Four Cardinal Principles, Shame is the most important. Confucius said of scholars: "Conduct yourself with Shame." Mencius said: "People cannot be without Shame. The Shame of being without Shame is shamelessness." He also said: "Shame is of great importance to people. Those who are skilled in opportunism have no use for Shame." The reason is that a person's lack of Integrity leads to violating Propriety and Righteousness, and its origin is all in the lack of Shame. A shameless heart is also a major obstacle to progress. As the saying goes, "If you are not ashamed of being inferior to others, how can you be like others?" If you do not know that your incompetence is shameful, you will never have a desire to improve, and you will never have hope of success. Therefore, an stubborn and shameless individual will never fail, and an stubborn and shameless country will never perish. Since the Opium War, up to the September 18th Incident, our country has repeatedly suffered national disasters, but we still do not know how to be inspired, and we still steal and live in peace. This is truly the utmost in shamelessness.</p>
<p>According to what has been said above, the meaning of the Four Cardinal Principles has been analyzed clearly, and the source of China's current illness has also been thoroughly examined. By comparing the two, the Four Cardinal Principles are indeed the right medicine for the symptoms, and they are indeed a panacea for saving the country, and they are also China's unique prescription. Therefore, the prosperity of the Four Cardinal Principles is the restoration of China's inherent morality. The New Life Movement, which is based on the Four Cardinal Principles, is a revival movement of China's inherent culture. This is different from the Renaissance in Western history, but it has the same goal. We all know that modern Western civilization was created by the Industrial Revolution. We do not know that the success of the Industrial Revolution is still the manifestation of material civilization. The driving force behind this material civilization depends entirely on the Western spiritual civilization having been reformed first. It all depends on them reviving the arts and literature that embody the inherent historical spirit of Europe. Therefore, we should not despise the Four Cardinal Principles just because they are not imported goods. It is precisely because they are not imported goods that they are suitable for China's national conditions and embody the spirit of Chinese history. Our work today in reviving the Four Cardinal Principles should at least be as diligent as the work of the Europeans in the 18th century in the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Third, why must the Four Cardinal Principles be expressed in the daily life of "food, clothing, housing, and transportation"? Is this to cultivate virtues from the heart, or if we only focus on the external expression of form, wouldn't it be close to superficiality and prone to hypocrisy?</p>
<p>The cultivation of the Four Cardinal Principles, whether from an individual perspective or from a social perspective, cannot be achieved solely by internal cultivation. All human virtues are good habits. There are two ways to create these good habits: one is to cultivate them from the heart and develop them externally; the other is to train them externally and instill them internally. Although the paths are different, the destination can be reached in the same way. However, comparing the two paths, it is more practical, effective, and easier to achieve success to train externally than to cultivate internally. Moreover, the New Life that we are doing, which is based on the Four Cardinal Principles, requires the entire society to move, and most people must be able to implement it, and it is especially necessary to take the second path of external training. Anyone or any society that wants to improve their daily life must force themselves to become a habit, and then become natural. When this person becomes natural, this is good morality. When this society becomes natural, this is good custom. All human morals must be simplified and popularized, with nothing high or deep, and nothing superficial. As long as we train in the same way and practice in the same way, there is no such thing as hypocrisy or non-hypocrisy. The so-called distinction between high and deep and superficial is the argument of those who talk about morality but do not practice it. If the principles of the Four Cardinal Principles are only talked about in words and not practiced, or if they only ask others to practice them but do not practice them themselves, or if they practice them today but not tomorrow, then this is not a new life, this is hypocrisy. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said very solemnly in the outline of the New Life Movement that the Four Cardinal Principles must be expressed in the daily life of "food, clothing, housing, and transportation." This is the reason.</p>
<p>Human daily life, from an abstract point of view, has the distinction between self-cultivation, dealing with others, and handling affairs. From a practical point of view, it is nothing more than clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Transportation is originally traveling, but it is also behavior. Therefore, self-cultivation, dealing with others, and handling affairs are also included in behavior. Therefore, clothing, food, housing, and transportation have both spiritual and material relationships, and they are indeed the general term for daily life. Human daily life, clothing, food, housing, and transportation cannot be interrupted for a day, then the Four Cardinal Principles cannot be abandoned for a day. Not only can they not be abandoned, but they must also be expressed in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, anytime, anywhere, and in everything. If not, then they will become empty talkers of the Four Cardinal Principles rather than practitioners, just like the pure talk of the Jin people, the metaphysics of the Song Confucians, and the Zen of the Buddhists. All day long, they always want to cultivate themselves internally, to see their own nature, to point directly to the original. In fact, they are talking about cultivation apart from life, so that cultivation is cultivation and life is life. There is no relationship between the two. This is not seeing what is desirable and keeping the heart unmoved. Where can it be reliable? Therefore, the result of the Jin people's emphasis on pure talk was that the Five Barbarians invaded China. The result of the Song Confucians' emphasis on metaphysics was that China was first destroyed by the Mongols and then by the Manchus. The result of the Buddhists' practice of Zen was that India was forever mired in decline and has not been able to escape the bondage of the British to this day. These mirrors are very scary to look at. Therefore, if we want to save the country from disaster and revive the nation, we must not only restore the inherent morality of the Four Cardinal Principles, but we must also express the spirit of the Four Cardinal Principles practically in the daily life of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. This is the reason.</p>
<p>Of course, to express the spirit of the Four Cardinal Principles, we should not explain it word by word, citing numerous references, and being constrained by the text. We should only turn the correct principles and necessary conditions of the Four Cardinal Principles into something very simple and popular, so that everyone can easily understand and practice it, and every family can know and practice it. In his successive speeches, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specifically put forward eight conditions: "Neatness," "Cleanliness," "Simplicity," "Plainness," "Harmony," "Solemnity," "Speed," and "Reliability," as the guidelines for our daily lives. The opposite of these eight conditions is "Disorder," "Filth," "Complexity," "Luxury," "Arrogance," "Romance," "Procrastination," and "Carelessness." Those who meet the eight positive conditions and do not fall into the eight negative conditions are following Propriety and practicing Righteousness. Those who violate the eight positive conditions and fall into the eight negative conditions are violating Propriety and Righteousness. Those who have a clear distinction between which kind of life meets the eight positive conditions and which kind of life falls into the eight negative conditions and know what to follow and what to disobey are being Honest. If one's own life violates the eight positive conditions and falls into the eight negative conditions, then one should be deeply ashamed. If other people's lives violate the eight positive conditions and fall into the eight negative conditions, then one should deeply hate and denounce them. Those who have a sincere realization and can decisively take and abandon are being Shameful. This is the method of expressing the Four Cardinal Principles in daily life, and it can also be seen that daily life does have the possibility of expressing the Four Cardinal Principles.</p>
<p>In short, the Four Cardinal Principles that we want to promote are not to be talked about, but to be practiced. They are not to be practiced occasionally, but to be practiced at all times. They are not to be practiced by a few people, but to be practiced by the majority of people. Then, we are afraid that the meaning of the Four Cardinal Principles will be said to be too profound. It is better to be more superficial and more suitable. As long as everyone earnestly does it according to this superficial principle, are we still afraid that it will be prone to hypocrisy?</p>
<p>I have already answered the above three questions one by one based on my personal research. In addition to this, there were originally two other important issues raised for discussion from various aspects. One is that some people say that saving China and reviving the nation should prioritize importing modern scientific knowledge and skills. Advocating the Four Cardinal Principles now is neglecting what is urgent and rushing what is slow. Another argument is that the lives of Chinese citizens are too low. They are starving and freezing. What they need is a movement for survival, not a New Life Movement. Is it still possible to talk about the Four Cardinal Principles? These two questions both need to be answered in detail, but in the outline of the New Life Movement written by Mr. Chiang, he has already refuted these two kinds of skeptics very thoroughly, so there is no need for me to repeat them.

<h3>Large-Scale Crackdown on Opium Dens Inside and Outside Songjiang City</h3>
<p>Since the province issued the four-year ban on opium, various counties have followed the regulations to organize opium prohibition committees, appointing three local people as members to prepare for the registration of addicts, the solicitation of merchants to handle soil paste shops, and the allocation of land. At the same time, they have prepared a budget for the committee and opium addiction treatment hospitals and submitted it to the province for approval. However, the provincial order has been delayed in coming to Songjiang, and the committee's various preparations have been temporarily suspended. Some profit-seeking people, seeing that the ban has been suspended and the judicial organs are not handling it, have successively sought houses to organize opium dens for people to smoke. Even in prosperous downtown areas, they are openly uninhibited. This has been going on for two months. Now, the county government has received a provincial order to strictly order the registration of opium addicts within a time limit. However, only a few addicts have applied for registration. After repeated announcements and warnings with gongs, there has been no effect. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau was ordered to dispatch all four police stations in the city and suburbs to mobilize fully on one evening to conduct a large-scale search of opium dens within their jurisdiction. For a time, the opium dens were caught off guard. Opium dens were seized in the homes of Peng Pu, Shi Nong, Gui Bai, and Sheng Kaiqi in the Puzhao Temple area in District 1, in the Caishen Lane area in District 2, and in the homes of Wang Zhang and Li Desheng in Districts 3 and 4, along with more than 20 addicts and evidence, and all were transferred to the county government for verification. It is said that this move is to encourage the registration of opium addicts.</p>
<h3>Luta Steamship to Taicang Resumes Normal Service</h3>

It is now learned that the company has leased the Yuanji steamship and will resume normal service starting on August 5.</p>
<h3>Qian Axiao Found Not Guilty in Master-Servant Love Affair</h3>
<p>Yang Zhiru's third daughter, Jingde, 28 years old, from a wealthy family in Fangjiaqiao in this county, fell in love with the male servant Qian Axiao. Later, she became pregnant and the two of them eloped together on the 19th day of the first month of the lunar calendar and lived together outside Qimen in Suzhou. In May of the lunar calendar, she was found by her elder sister, Jinzhi, who hired lawyers Qian Wei, Gao Wang, and Kunfu to sue Qian for abduction and other crimes in the county judiciary. Qian also hired lawyer Lu Qi to countersue Yang Zhiru and his son for defamation and deprivation of freedom. After several court hearings in the county government, the county ruled that Qian Axiao was not guilty of the Yang's lawsuit. The Qian's lawsuit is scheduled to be announced on August 3.</p>

<h3>Deadline to Eradicate Locusts in East and West Mountains</h3>
<p>Although the East and West Dongting Mountains in Wu County are located along the edge of Taihu Lake, the farmland is barren due to the high mountainous terrain and the difficulty for farmers to draw water. Unexpectedly, a large number of locusts were suddenly discovered the day before yesterday, covering the sky and the sun, forming groups of millions. Many autumn seedlings have been gnawed on, and the villagers are in great panic. After receiving the report, the Wu County Public Security Bureau specially instructed the police district in charge yesterday (the 2nd) to join forces with the township mayor to gather the people and eradicate the locusts as much as possible within three days to avoid spreading.</p>

<h3>Reduce Autumn Sericulture Improvement Fee</h3>
<p>The Suzhou Provincial Sericulture Improvement Committee stipulates that cocoon merchants pay 12 yuan of silver for silkworm seed price and sericulture improvement fee for each load of dry cocoons received. The cocoon industry generally adopts the all-inclusive baking system, which is not limited by the amount of loads. The baking fee is stipulated at 12 yuan per load of dry cocoons, including 8 yuan for baking firewood and repairs, and 3 yuan for profit. The current cocoon price is low, and the drought has caused disaster. It is appropriate to reduce the fee accordingly. It was resolved at the seventh meeting of this session that the sericulture improvement fee for this autumn will be reduced by 6 yuan per load of dry cocoons, using the market scale as the standard. The baking fee is stipulated at 9 yuan, and the distribution is as follows: (1) 6.5 yuan for baking firewood and repairs, (2) 2.5 yuan for profit. The above methods were ordered by the Department of Construction to the Wuxi County Government and the sericulture improvement area yesterday, which were forwarded to all cocoon merchants for information.</p>

<h3>Merchants from Various Banks Jointly Sue the Four Banks Guild</h3>
<p>Zhang Jingting, Fang Zhongchi, and other merchants from the Anhui bank, sued the Four Banks Guild in the Jiangdu Court and the High Court because the Guild had misappropriated a large sum of remaining funds from the Anhui bank.

To protect their interests, the merchants requested the Jiangdu Branch to provisionally seize the company's deposits in the Yisheng Qianzhuang in the city, amounting to nearly 10,000 yuan. It is heard that the amount of the misappropriation, including principal and interest, amounts to 300,000 yuan. Many merchants from the Anhui bank have followed suit with lawsuits and requested that the company's deposits in various banks and qianzhuang, as well as bank shares and silver, and Anhui provincial treasury bonds, be seized in succession to prevent future enforcement difficulties. It is also reported that other ticket merchants from various banks, in view of the Anhui merchant's seizure of funds, are deeply concerned that the Guild's capital stock, bank shares, silver, and Anhui provincial treasury bonds may be misappropriated and are also planning to jointly sue to prevent future enforcement difficulties.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Red Pills Seized at the Bagua Bridge in Ningbo</h3>
<p>The night ferries running between Yin and Zhen are popular among ordinary people because of their cheaper fares. However, in recent times, some lawless drug traffickers have had the wild idea of transporting drugs at night and on small roads, instead of by ship or during the day, to avoid the attention of the military and police because of the strict investigations. The Security Branch Detective Team learned that someone was posing as a passenger to transport drugs on the Yin-Zhen night ferry. Yesterday morning (the 29th) at 3:00 am, they dispatched team members Zhao Wenbo and others to investigate and found 90 packs of red pills, totaling 60,000 pills, on the ferry at the Bagua Bridge on the border of Yin and Zhen.

<h3>The Local Association Purchases a Large Quantity of Saigon Rice to Prevent Famine</h3>
<p>Over 4,000 Tons at a Price of Over Ten Yuan Per Stone</p>
<p>Preparing to Carry Out Price Stabilization to Relieve the People</p>
<p>Dagon Society said that because the national water and drought disasters this year are severe, and the price of rice has skyrocketed, the Local Association of this city has specially ordered more than 4,000 tons of Saigon rice to adjust the food supply of the whole city and carry out price stabilization to relieve the people's livelihood. It will be loaded in Shanghai this month. The rice merchants directly purchased 15,000 bags of Saigon indica rice, which has been shipped to Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Ordering Over 4,000 Tons of Saigon Rice</h3>
<p>Previously, at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Association, it was noted that since the beginning of summer this year, drought disasters have occurred in various provinces in the Jiangnan region, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, causing crops to wither. The provinces bordering the Yellow River have also been affected by floods, reducing the autumn harvest. Therefore, it was decided to order more than 4,000 tons of foreign rice. Kui Yanfang, director of the Accounting Department of the Association, contacted and introduced the rice merchants in this city to order Saigon indica rice. Including import tariffs and transportation costs, the cost per stone is 10.56 yuan. After the contract was signed by both parties, the rice merchants and import and export foreign firms notified and reported the loading. It is expected that the goods can be delivered in Shanghai this month.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Railways Approves Special Freight Rates for Grain Transportation</h3>
<p>Continued for Five Months to Facilitate Adjustment</p>
<p>The special freight rates for transporting grain on the two railways were originally scheduled to end on July 31. After the Railway Bureau submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways, it was approved to continue for five months. The telegram stated: "Regarding the request to continue the special freight rates for grain for five months, the current agricultural difficulties have not been resolved, and the wheat season is approaching."</p>
<h3>Relief for the People and Price Stabilization</h3>
<p>The Local Association was established by various groups during the Shanghai War on January 28, three years ago. The projects it has undertaken have been aimed at relieving the citizens of Shanghai. All sectors have deep faith in the association, and wealthy merchants have voluntarily donated and supported it, making the fund very sufficient. After the 4,000 tons of Saigon indica rice arrive in Shanghai, it will be stored in warehouses and, in March of next year, when supplies are short or rice prices soar, price stabilization will be carried out at the original cost.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Purchase and Ship Rice to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The rice merchants directly ordered 15,000 bags of foreign indica rice from Saigon (the newspaper reported 20,000 bags in error), which were shipped and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Managed by various firms such as Yongda and Gongli in this port, the cost is about 10 yuan per stone. The Dagon Society reporter inquired with the managing merchants yesterday. After the indica rice was shipped to Shanghai, it was unloaded and stored in warehouses due to cost considerations and is not being sold temporarily. It will be sold as soon as the market price rises slightly. Yesterday, rice merchants in this port flocked to the managing firms to purchase samples. In this situation, the government should approve it to facilitate adjustment and benefit transportation. The five-month continuation will be from August 1 to December 31.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Will Go to Jiangxi</h3>

It was decided that the head office of the grain transport and sales bureau would be set up in Shanghai, and branch offices would be set up in various places. It is currently being actively prepared, but it is difficult to determine when it will be established. Kong was invited by Chairman Jiang and plans to return to Nanjing soon without staying in Shanghai. He is scheduled to go to Jiangxi next week.

<h3>Huang Fu Will Come to Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>Yin Tong Waits to Meet Gu Before Returning North</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Affairs Consolidation Committee of the Executive Yuan stationed in Ping, has been south for a month. Because the Dalian meeting has achieved considerable results, and Premier Wang has repeatedly sent personnel to urge him, he has agreed to come down to Shanghai within ten days to take care of family affairs and then return north to Nanjing. The report said that Huang's staff, Gao Shilian, etc., had returned north first to make arrangements. According to the reporter's investigation, this is a misrepresentation. Although Huang's staff, Gao Shilian, etc., did go north some days ago, they have since returned to Shanghai. The reporter met them on the road yesterday. As for Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, he is still staying at Mount Moriss and has not come to Shanghai. It is understood that Yin will wait for Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, to return to Nanjing before going to Nanjing to pay his respects and then return north.</p>

<h3>Constructing a Central Station</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways Raises Funds and the Railway Bureau Handles the Engineering</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways previously ordered the Railway Bureau to survey and design a central station between Ziyoumen and Zhongshanmen in the capital, so that the Shanghai-Nanjing, Tianjin-Pukou, and Nanjing-Wuhu Railways could be connected. After the bureau complied and submitted the plan, the Ministry convened a meeting of representatives of relevant agencies on June 28. Deputy Director Wu, Deputy Director Pu of the Engineering Department, and Director Xiao of the Traffic Department attended the meeting. It was decided that the range of the central station's routes would extend to the city walls at both ends, and the routes outside Zhongshanmen would not be part of the central station. The Ministry of Railways would directly manage the fundraising, and the engineering would be handled by the Railway Bureau on behalf of the Ministry. The construction method would be divided into formal stations and temporary stations, and it was decided to build a temporary station first to meet current needs. Regarding</p>
<h3>Railway Connections</h3>
<p>The routes and construction scope, as well as the methods to be adopted at the intersections of railways and various roads, were also decided separately. As for the construction period, the two railways stated that the section of the Shanghai-Nanjing connection line would be completed in about five months from the date of signing the contract. Later, a design meeting was held for the central station site, and it was decided that the central station would be the main passenger station, and freight loading and unloading facilities would be attached temporarily. The method would follow the second plan previously proposed by the bureau, and the two railways would propose simple equipment and a budget to be approved by the Ministry based on the current needs. However, the connection line from Taipingmen Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway to Ziyoumen would be postponed, and the connection line from Hepingmen to Ziyoumen would be built first, so that both the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway</p>
<h3>Can Be Applied</h3>
<p>After the representatives of the two railways returned to the bureau, they considered this project to be very urgent. The Engineering Department immediately decided to build two passenger tracks, each 610 meters long, and four freight tracks, each 400 meters long, a single-sided passenger platform, a double-sided freight platform, a temporary station building, and two staff residences, according to the second plan previously proposed. The drawings were completed separately and submitted to the Ministry for approval. The surveying work has been delegated by the Ministry to a surveying team to set up</p>
<h3>Central Station</h3>
<p>Boundary markers. The second step will be to set up the centerline markers from Hepingmen to Ziyoumen and survey and map the plan and profile of the line for valuation purposes. The surveying teams of the two railways and the Nanjing Municipal Engineering Bureau have agreed to open a road from the central station to Zhongshan Road. All land acquisition issues have also been submitted to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<h3>Article 9 of the Savings Law</h3>
<p>The Bankers' Association Will Meet Today to Request Amendments</p>
<p>Shenshe News Agency said that since the promulgation of the Savings Bank Law on the 4th of last month, banking leaders Zhang Gongquan and Chen Guangfu have been petitioning. Suddenly, on the 20th, an order was issued to all banks to implement Article 9 of the Savings Law. The Bankers' Association has decided to convene a meeting of the Standing Committee members Zhang Gongquan, Chen Guangfu, Wu Yunzhai, and Ye Fuxiao this afternoon at 4:00 pm to discuss the Savings Bank Law and the documents to be replied to the Ministry of Finance. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Order of the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>After the promulgation and implementation of the Savings Bank Law, there are many provisions in the articles that the banking sector cannot implement in practice. A small committee was specially formed in the Bankers' Association to study the inappropriate aspects of the law. The results of the study were publicly entrusted to Zhang Gongquan, Tang Shoumin, Chen Guangfu, Xu Xinliu, and other four people to represent the Bankers' Association and consult with Kong from the Ministry of Finance to request amendments. It was agreed to amend the law. Unexpectedly, while negotiations were underway, the banks suddenly received an order from the Ministry of Finance to deposit one-fourth of the total savings amount stipulated in Article 9 of the Savings Law for savings banks, to purchase government securities at the market price, and deposit them with the Central Bank for safekeeping. Because the entire Savings Law was being requested for amendment and could not be partially implemented, the banks held a meeting at the Bankers' Association some days ago and decided to submit a document stating the difficulties and requesting a temporary postponement of the implementation of Article 9 during the petition period.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Amendments</h3>
<p>The reply document has been drafted by Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers' Association, and will be submitted to the Standing Committee for discussion and amendment today. The content of the document includes the following points: (1) If the Savings Law is to be implemented, it must be fully complied with and implemented. The provisions of Article 9 cannot be put forward first to order the banks to implement them. (2) There are many inappropriate aspects of the Savings Law, and amendments are still being requested. During the petition period, please postpone the implementation. (3) Article 9 of the Savings Law stipulates that savings banks should have at least one-fourth of the total amount of savings deposited, purchase government bonds and treasury bills, and other assets with reliable guarantees, and deposit them in a special depository of the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>German Consul-General in Shanghai Mourns the German President</h3>

<p>National News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd Dispatch: German President Hindenburg passed away on the 2nd of this month. The reporter went to the German Consulate-General in this port to inquire about everything. Consul-General Kribai told the following: "Marshal Hindenburg, President of our country, suddenly passed away today. Germans everywhere are flying flags at half-mast and deeply mourning. The German people have always loved and deeply trusted President Hindenburg. Now that this pillar has suddenly collapsed, all the German people are grieving together. President Hindenburg was born at a time that is now history. He was physically strong, loyal, brave, fair, and honest. He was a model for German soldiers. He personally participated in the two major wars of 1866 and 1870 to 1871 for the unification of Germany, serving the country and achieving great achievements. Later, due to his advanced age, he retired. However, due to the outbreak of the European War and the urgency of the eastern border, he was ordered to command the German army to defend East Prussia. President Hindenburg met his Chief of Staff, General Ludendorff, and entrusted him with his trust.</p>

<h3>Two Hurricanes in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Still Far From Shanghai</p>
<p>The Temperature Was Still High Yesterday</p>
<p>National News Agency said that since the last hurricane was discovered in the Pacific Ocean and blew towards Korea, two more hurricanes have recently occurred in the ocean.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Inspection Group, Including Situ Xian, Returned to Southeast Asia Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Encourage Overseas Chinese to Invest in the Motherland</p>
<p>Revitalize Domestic Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Among our overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, many possess great influence and economic power in industry and commerce. Since the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission encouraged overseas Chinese to invest in the motherland and jointly develop industry, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and Java organized a motherland inspection group. The group consisted of nine members, all wealthy merchants from Batavia, Surabaya, and Semarang, with Situ Xian elected as the group leader. After returning to China from Java, they first visited various cities in North China to inspect the state of domestic industry, commerce, and the economy. Then, they went to Qingdao. The group members were welcomed by local officials, businessmen, and organizations everywhere they went. This year, they came to Shanghai from Qingdao and then visited Nanjing and Hangzhou. After the tour, they purchased tickets from the Java Company and left Shanghai for Southeast Asia yesterday afternoon. According to the group members, their observation in the motherland, along with the guidance from officials and businessmen, has given them a clear understanding of the current state of domestic industry and commerce. Upon returning to Southeast Asia, they will publicize their experiences and encourage overseas Chinese to invest in the motherland, to promote the development of domestic industry and commerce, and so on.</p>
<p>defined as (A) government bonds and treasury bills, and (B) assets with reliable guarantees. The order now received only covers government bonds and treasury bills, which is clearly inconsistent with the original meaning of the law. (4) Government bonds and securities are issued by the government and should maintain absolute credibility. Securities deposited with the Central Bank should be based on the face value of the securities and not calculated based on the market price discount, to avoid undermining credibility.</p>
<p>肱, their spirit was united, exceeding expectations, until they dispersed in 1918. Hindenburg was meritorious in protecting the nation and received supreme honors. Towards the end of the European War, he was again ordered to command the national army. Although the opposing forces were far superior in terms of materials and manpower, this teacher still adhered to the principle of "stronger as he grows older," striving to make a final attempt amidst the increasingly urgent foreign aggression. President Hindenburg was highly respected and held a lofty position, yet he was never arrogant, treating people with extreme humility. Having experienced the joys and sorrows of life, his will was firm, and his generosity was broad. He shared the hardships with his soldiers. During the European War, all the soldiers under his command knew his extraordinary bearing, clear and steady speech, sharp eyes, and extraordinary spirit. All his subordinates were influenced by him. From generals to soldiers, everyone loved and respected him. He was never seen to be furious, nor did he ever lose his dignity. He strived for the happiness of his subordinates and relieved their suffering. Hindenburg's military management was effective, and his personality was extraordinary, as described above. After taking office as president, he was deeply trusted by the people, not only in Germany but also in foreign countries and in international policies, Hindenburg was also a defender of peace and morality. President Hindenburg had already shown the way to German leaders in his early years, guiding them in both bad and good times, doing his best to protect them. Hindenburg dedicated his life to defending the country, his hard work was meritorious, and his old age was respected. Now that he has passed away suddenly, how can we not grieve?</p>
<p>distant, making it difficult to predict. As for the temperature, it has been getting hotter in recent days. Today (i.e., yesterday), the high was 97.9 degrees, and the low was 77.7 degrees. If the typhoon does not change direction and blows close to the East China Sea, then the coastal areas of China may get cooler weather.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Declaration for Improving Tobacco Leaves</h3>

Minister Kong came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. Recognizing their efforts in production, he highly praised them and issued a declaration of establishment for the association to encourage them. The original text is recorded below: "Ever since the opening of trade, many industries and businesses in our country have adopted new Western methods to seek improvement. However, in agriculture, we still adhere to old habits and conservative methods. We do not know that agriculture is the mother of all industries and the foundation of industry. All needs for raw materials depend on production, and agriculture is the only reliance. Neglecting the root and focusing on the branches, everyone knows the matter will not succeed. Looking around, industry and commerce are not thriving, and there has been no development. In this era of commercial warfare, we often lag behind in everything, leading to economic hardship and market depression. The countryside is now on the verge of bankruptcy, and the phenomenon of recession can be said to have reached its peak. The source of the problem lies in the neglect of agriculture and the backwardness of production. Taking tobacco leaves as an example, it is one aspect. Tobacco leaves are the only major ingredient in cigarette raw materials. The quality of cigarettes depends entirely on the quality of tobacco leaves. Our country's products are inferior and cannot compete with the good American varieties. Therefore, most merchants in various places who engage in this business purchase imported tobacco. Domestic products account for less than one-third. The annual outflow of funds for this item is countless millions. We watch the outflow of profits without seeking ways to remedy it, which is truly regrettable. Previously, British and American companies purchased American tobacco seeds and distributed them to farmers for trial planting for many years. The Tax Affairs Department has repeatedly sent personnel, together with officials from the Cigarette Association, to inspect the situation in various places. However, since there was no dedicated responsibility and the sowing was not well done, not only has the product made little progress, but the original curing tobacco in various places has become increasingly degraded. The reason for this is that tobacco farmers are content with old ways and there is a lack of guidance. Now, Mr. Wu Tingsheng, a member of the Cigarette Business Committee, has initiated the organization of the American Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee, which is directly under the Tax Department, to guide tobacco farmers in improving and reorganizing. This Minister appreciates their efforts to revitalize domestic products and believes that the intention is good and the method is sound. I am optimistic about its success. Therefore, I have approved the allocation of 50,000 yuan from the Cigarette Industry's request to allocate funds to assist in suppressing smuggling as a founding fund. The implementation plan will start in Xuchang, Henan. After success, it will be gradually promoted and expanded in Qingzhou in Shandong, Mentai in Anhui, and other places. Our country has vast and fertile land, coupled with diligent and low-cost farmers and workers. If we can guide them according to the situation and strive for improvement, we will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort. Moreover, the quantity of tobacco leaves needed depends on the increase or decrease of the cigarette business. Now that the sales of domestic cigarettes have been increasing year by year, the demand for tobacco leaves will inevitably become more and more extensive. Our people should seize the opportunity to catch up and strive to supply domestic products. In the future, if domestic products are sufficient and have a surplus, not only will there be no need to rely on foreigners, but we can also recover huge outflows of funds and sell them abroad to compete with American leaves, thereby helping to revive the rural economy and further benefiting the construction plan. This is a win-win situation. This Minister will eagerly await it. This is a special declaration."</p>
<h3>Xu Baiyuan Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Regarding the Issue of the Savings and Remittance Bureau Acting as an Agent for the Directorate General of Posts and Telecommunications in Receiving and Paying Funds</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that regarding the issue of the Savings and Remittance Bureau acting as an agent for the Ministry of Communications' Directorate General of Posts and Telecommunications in receiving and paying funds, the Savings and Remittance Bureau and the two labor unions of the Postal Service have issued messages with slight discrepancies, which have been reported in the newspapers. Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Director of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, issued a statement yesterday to clarify the facts, stating that the representatives of the two associations came to visit yesterday morning. After a detailed explanation and a line-by-line interpretation of the full text of the contract, it was proven that the bureau was actually benefiting without any harm. The representatives understood, and it was reported that the association was also satisfied with the explanation of the representatives. According to the investigation, the receipt and payment procedures started in July. By the end of the month, a total of 700,000 yuan was received (some figures have not yet been included, and the detailed figures will be published after they are finalized). On July 25, the amount paid on behalf of the Directorate General of Posts and Telecommunications was only 620,000 yuan. After offsetting, there was still a surplus. The remittance income obtained by the Savings and Remittance Bureau from acting as an agent for receiving and paying funds also reached several hundred yuan. However, according to the calculation at the time of payment on July 25, there was still a shortfall of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, but the income of the seven days from July 25 to July 31 was sufficient to make up the surplus. The association submitted a telegram to the Ministry and stated in yesterday's conversation that the overdraft was 500,000 yuan per month, which was not true. The supervisory authorities of the bureau include the Ministry of Communications, the Supervisory Committee, and Chinese and foreign accountants, who audit the accounts quarterly. The procedures are serious, and the management is cautious. The interests of depositors and the safety of savings are extremely well protected. The amount of savings increases year by year, and the credit is increasing day by day, which is truly commendable among state-run enterprises in our country. However, compared with Europe, America, and Japan in terms of savings figures, we still feel far behind. We should cherish the original foundation, jointly seek common expressions, cultivate the virtue of national savings, and save the current economic crisis. The future development depends on the support of people from all walks of life and the joint efforts of the postal and savings bureaus.</p>
<h3>Chinese Tobacco Factories Request to Maintain the Current Two-Tier Tax</h3>
<p>Forty companies, including local Chinese cigarette factories and citizens, requested to amend the current cigarette tax rate, as the treatment of Chinese and foreign companies is unequal, and suggested adopting a seven-tier tax. The government side, because the tax reform will affect tax revenue, has been slow to express a clear position. Now that the new tax regulations have been announced, the cigarette tax rate has also been revised, but compared with the current two-tier tax, there is an increase without a decrease. The tobacco merchants have not achieved their goal of requesting a tax reduction, and the government has announced the implementation of new tax regulations to increase taxes, which they seem unable to bear. Therefore, they have held several meetings. The result of the discussion is that since the government will not reduce the tax rate, they also hope that the burden on tobacco merchants will not be increased, and the current two-tier tax will still be maintained.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Merchants Have Received Concessions from the French Concession</h3>
<p>Concessions from the Chinese Area Will Also Be Issued</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Replied to the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that rickshaw merchants in the Public Concession are dissatisfied with the new regulations promulgated by the Rickshaw Management Committee. At the same time, the Municipal Council also refused to issue rickshaw licenses for August because the merchants failed to obtain owner certificates. The two sides have reached a stalemate. The news obtained yesterday is as follows:</p>
<h3>Licenses Received from the French Concession</h3>
<p>The French Concession's rickshaw licenses are issued by the Rickshaw Association's special zone office, divided into 144 households for donation. The total number of licenses is the same as the Public Concession, totaling 10,000. Since the donation of licenses in the Public Concession has encountered problems due to the implementation of new regulations by the Rickshaw Management Committee, the French Concession has indicated that it will continue to handle the matter as before. Therefore, the 10,000 licenses in the French Concession have been collected in full by the 144 donors yesterday. As for the concessions from the Chinese area, they are usually issued after the 15th of each month. This month, they will still be issued with the seal of the association, without any problems.</p>
<h3>Discovery of a Rickshaw Pullers' Delegation</h3>
<p>Rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession have never had any organization. Since the new regulations issue arose, some have expressed opposition, and some have expressed support. In fact, they are all impostors. Yesterday, a delegation claiming to be "Representatives of 3,000 Real Rickshaw Pullers in Shanghai" printed and distributed a book, appealing to people from all walks of life for fair assistance. The book is divided into four sections, and the content unconditionally supports the facilities of the Municipal Council's Rickshaw Management Committee. The book ends by saying that the rickshaw pullers have printed 30,000 leaflets, which will be distributed immediately to advise rickshaw puller compatriots, etc. However, the book does not have the address of the delegation, which is very suspicious.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council's Reply to the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a reply from Mr. Zhong Si, Director-General of the Municipal Council, stating: "Dear Sirs, We have received your letter of July 25 and the excerpt of the letter from the Rickshaw Industry Association, both of which have been read. Now, the points raised by the association have been noted by the Municipal Council and discussed in detail with the representatives of the association."</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Merchants are Willing to Voluntarily Reduce Rent</h3>
<p>The person in charge of the Rickshaw Merchants Association of this city issued a statement yesterday regarding the article "Representatives of 3,000 Real Rickshaw Pullers in Shanghai Appealing to People from All Walks of Life for Fair Assistance," stating the following: (1) The statement in the article that the association believes that the rickshaw problem is related to "500,000 people, and it is considered to be intimidating and disturbing the society" is investigated. There are 10,000 rickshaws in the Public Concession, and there are more than 1,000 households of owners. The total number of rickshaw pullers is about 100,000. If each household is counted as four people, then the association's statement that 500,000 people directly and indirectly rely on rickshaws for their livelihoods is not false. The article mentions that there are only 50,000 rickshaw pullers. I am afraid that the so-called real rickshaw pullers who wrote the article did not understand the truth about the rickshaw business in this city. (2) The article also says, "Rickshaw puller registration is actually to save us rickshaw pullers from the hell of selling our bodies. In the future, with registration and certificates, we can pull rickshaws everywhere." The relationship between rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers is only a rental relationship between landlords and tenants. It is not comparable to slave labor, and it is ridiculous for the rickshaw pullers to compare themselves to "selling their bodies." Moreover, even if the rickshaw pullers have not registered, why can't they "pull rickshaws everywhere"? In short, the association believes that the rickshaw puller registration is unreasonable, purely to remove the shackles of rickshaw pullers' lifelong development and to facilitate the livelihood of rickshaw pullers who come from rural bankruptcies or use rickshaw pulling as a sideline during the slack farming season, and to avoid tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers from being unemployed and endangering social peace and stability. I sincerely hope that the real rickshaw pullers will understand this. (3) The merchant's capital investment, in addition to car inspection, taxes, paint repairs, and concession licensing from three different authorities, when the weather is hot or snowy, or when the rickshaw pullers are sick or cannot find rickshaw pullers, they must park their rickshaws and stop doing business. As a result, the number of days that are available in each month for running a rickshaw business is only 24 days. The rickshaw rental per day is 90 cents, so if calculated for 30 days the rickshaw owners should receive $2.70. The cost is 1.3 yuan for wood, 1.3 yuan for copper and iron, 0.5 yuan for paint, 1 yuan for a rickshaw covering, 2 yuan for tires, 0.5 yuan for a backrest and pad, 0.5 yuan for rain gear and a uniform, 5.11 yuan for the fees for the three concessions, 4 yuan for labor and rent, 1 yuan for license fees and repairs, 0.2 yuan for a lamp, 0.1 yuan for an association fee, and 0.05 yuan for donation to charity. So, the monthly expense is 17.56 yuan. The surplus per rickshaw is only 2.44 yuan. The rickshaw pullers' statement that "there are still 13 yuan of extra profit to be made each month" is clearly a guess from outsiders. In short, the association has always been extremely concerned about helping rickshaw pullers and is very sympathetic to reforming rickshaws in the city. If the Municipal Council and the rickshaw merchants treat each other with sincerity, the association will not hesitate to make the greatest sacrifices to promote its realization. If anyone attempts to sabotage the rickshaw business with treacherous conspiracies, the association will defend the rickshaw merchants and fight to the death. Regarding the association's voluntary rent reduction and various relief efforts, they will be gradually implemented in the near future. Since the rickshaw pullers are so understanding, I sincerely hope that they will directly contribute their opinions to the association, and the association will sincerely welcome and accept them. Furthermore, I earnestly hope that the rickshaw pullers in the city will use the eyes of a mirror to see their own interests, unite on right and wrong, and rise up to fight for themselves. Please do not be tempted or threatened by others to passively be used as puppets by others. That is what the association hopes.</p>
<h3>Committee to Study It</h3>
<p>As a result of the meeting between Yin Zhiling, a representative of the rickshaw merchants in the special zone, and Zhong Si, Director-General of the Municipal Council, it is proposed that a committee (the name has not yet been decided) be organized by representatives of the Municipal Council and the rickshaw merchants to study the new regulations for improving rickshaws and reducing rickshaw rentals. It is scheduled to be decided after another meeting today. The Rickshaw Industry Association held a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday, and the special zone office held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 8:00 PM last night. There was a discussion on this, but the content was not allowed to be released.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Implements New Regulations</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports from this city that the Rickshaw Committee of the Public Concession has decided to implement the new regulations for rickshaws immediately. Regardless of whether the rickshaw merchants will make further opposition, the original proposal of the board of directors will be maintained and will not be changed. The Municipal Council's Gazette published an important announcement yesterday, which is recorded as follows: The Municipal Council has decided that from August of this year, when applying for a public rickshaw license, an owner's certificate issued by the Rickshaw Committee must be attached, otherwise the license will not be issued. Currently, about 700 applications for certificates have been received, but in fact, the number of applications received from existing owners is far less than this number. The Municipal Council will implement the policy of refusing to issue licenses without an owner's certificate. As a result, a number of licenses will be suspended or issued to other owners who are fully prepared to comply with the methods stipulated by the Municipal Council. The refusal of some existing owners to apply for certificates may cause a kind of disorder in the rickshaw industry and make vehicles insufficient. The Municipal Council has decided to implement the regulations and prevent all illegal or intimidating actions. At the same time, the Municipal Council is deeply aware that the refusal of some existing owners to apply for certificates may cause some rickshaw pullers to lose their jobs and suffer. In order to cope with this possible situation, if the number of applications for licenses received from existing owners does not meet the normal amount, the Rickshaw Affairs Committee will be prepared to accept applications from new owners or existing owners who comply with the Municipal Council's rules and want to expand their operations. The aforementioned applications must be submitted between July 25 and July 29. The applications must be in writing and submitted to the Municipal Council's General Office, Room 512, by post or with a return receipt book. The application must state the applicant's name, or the names of all partners if it is a partnership, as well as the address and the name of the guarantor, and must declare the number of vehicles that the applicant intends to operate. Applicants must comply with the Municipal Council's revised rules for public rickshaw licenses. Applications from owners who are willing to cooperate with the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association will be given priority by the Municipal Council. In addition, the Municipal Council's Rickshaw Committee has recently learned that there are some misunderstandings among public rickshaw owners regarding the Municipal Council's policy of adopting new rickshaws. The Municipal Council does not intend to order all existing vehicles to be replaced with new ones at once. However, once the new vehicle standard is determined, rickshaws that are deemed unusable by the inspection office will be ordered to be replaced with new vehicles. The Municipal Council does not intend to deem a large number of rickshaws unusable. Vehicles in good condition will be allowed to be used until they need to be replaced.</p>

<h3>A Foundry Worker Tragically Drowned, the Only Son of Three Families</h3>
<p>Claimed to Know a Thing or Two About Swimming</p>
<p>Only Had One Daughter After Marriage</p>
<p>Jin Kaiyuan (22 years old), from Wusong, worked at the foundry in Zhanghuabang Railway Station, Wusong. On July 31, he took leave to visit his friend Chen San in Tanziwan. Chen treated him to lunch, and they chatted happily. At around 4:00 PM, Chen suggested taking a cold bath due to the hot weather. He asked Jin Kaiyuan if he agreed to swim. Jin replied that he often swam and played in the Zhanghuabang River and knew a thing or two about swimming. So, they went to the Suzhou River together. They jumped into the river one after another. Unexpectedly, Jin only emerged once after entering the water. The second time he probably touched the bottom of the boat and was unable to surface. The tide in the Suzhou River is quite rapid, and there are many boats, so drownings occur from time to time. Jin Kaiyuan lacked experience and tragically drowned. Chen saw Jin disappear in the river and immediately shouted for help. After the boatmen helped to retrieve the body without success, Chen informed Jin's father, Jin Awei. Until 6:30 PM yesterday, Jin Kaiyuan's body floated in the river next to the flour mill. The corpse was taken for identification and confirmed to be Jin. Yesterday morning, Zhang Fengqi, the local headman, reported to the local court for an inquest. Soon after, Jin Awei, the deceased's father, also filed a petition with the court requesting exemption from the inquest.</p>
<p>The petition stated that he was 50 years old and had only one son named Kaiyuan, who also worked at the foundry. My family of three only has this one son. Although he got married last year, he only had one daughter, who is not yet a month old. My son drowned while swimming, and it is no one's fault. I request exemption from the inquest and am willing to provide a coffin. The request was denied. Zhao Chuanjia, the prosecutor, and Xuan Zhiming, the inspector, arrived at the scene. After verifying that it was indeed a drowning, and there were no other reasons, they ordered the immediate collection of the body.</p>
<h3>Tenants of Huanlong Road, Fushoufang Became Robbers</h3>
<p>Hua Shaozhi Was Robbed Clean</p>
<p>A three-story western-style detached house at No. 1 Fushoufang, in front of the French Garden on Huanlong Road in the French Concession, has been rented by Hua Shaozhi, who runs a photography studio. He moved in with his family only three days ago. Hua lived on the third floor and planned to rent out the remaining rooms on the second floor, so there was a rental notice at the entrance. At around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday (i.e., the first day), three men, all speaking with a northern accent, one wearing a straw hat and a silk gown, one wearing a suit, and one wearing shorts and a short-sleeved top, knocked on the door and entered, seeking to rent the remaining rooms. Hua's wife showed them the rooms, and they agreed on a rent of 45 yuan per month. They paid a deposit of 5 yuan and agreed to move in the next day. At 8:00 AM yesterday (the 2nd), when Hua had just gotten up, one of the three men came with a broom to wash the floor. At 9:00 AM, after Hua Shaozhi had breakfast and washed up, he was about to go out. When he walked from the third floor to the second floor, two of the men each held a handgun, blocked Hua, and warned him not to make a sound, claiming that they were new revolutionaries with many brothers and a shortage of military funds. They asked Hua to help them. After speaking, they strongly criticized the government officials for forming factions and seeking personal gain. They first searched Hua and found 75 yuan in cash. Then, they went to the third floor and took off the gold hairpins, gold watches, and gold rings worn by Hua's mother and wife. Then, they drove them into the pavilion, where one bandit guarded their actions with a gun. The remaining bandits ransacked Hua's room, overturning boxes and chests. They stole two sets of suits, 40 ties, and clothing and accessories, worth a total of 700-800 yuan. After searching, they tied Hua's hands and feet with rope and carried the loot into a small leather suitcase, leaving in a hurry. The bandits searched the house for three hours. It was not until after 11:00 AM that they escaped. Later, after the bandits left, Hua shouted for help. The neighbors entered and released them. They filed a report with the police station in charge, requesting an arrest.</p>
<h3>Trial Opens for Nephew Stealing Aunt's Private Savings</h3>
<p>Defense Attorney Requests Reconciliation</p>
<p>Court Orders Rescheduling of the Case for Retrial</p>
<p>Bi Furui, the Shanghai warehouse director of the Beipiao Coal Mine Company and a native of Shengze, Wujiang, had been gradually stealing his aunt, Xu Bi (also known as Xu Wu Taitai),'s bank stocks, gold jewelry, and diamond ornaments, worth over 100,000 yuan, from safe deposit box number 735 at the Zhongnan Bank since 1932. Now that the matter has been exposed, his father, Bi Yunbo, his brothers, Bi Yucheng and Bi Bingxie, and Wang Fusheng (alias Fosheng), the captain of the first district water police team of the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Force, stepped in to mediate, offering to return a portion of the stolen goods, about 40,000 yuan. Detectives Jiang Shangpei and Mao Yunlong of the police station arrested the aforementioned suspects separately and handed them over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Details of this case were reported in this newspaper on the 30th of last month. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special Court opened the Second Criminal Court to question the suspects. The police station was represented by attorneys Ru Baoyi and Zhang Shizhu, while the defendant hired attorneys Yuan Yang'an and Fan Gang for defense. First, Attorney Ru explained the circumstances, filing charges against Bi Furui for theft under Article 327 of the Criminal Code, and against Wang Fusheng, Bi Yunbo, Bi Yucheng, and Bi Bingxie for receiving stolen goods under Article 376 of the Criminal Code. The court then questioned Bi Furui about the theft. He confessed that he resorted to this as a last resort due to business failures. After stealing the items, he first hid them in Shengze Township, and then deposited them into safe deposit box number 172 at the Continental Bank. When the matter was discovered, he fled to Beiping. He then saw his father's advertisement in the newspaper, stating that the matter had been resolved and urging him to return to Shanghai immediately, so he rushed back. However, the matter was not yet settled. Upon arriving at the Continental Bank, he retrieved the stored items and handed them over to Wang and others for return to the plaintiff. Currently, only over 20,000 yuan is missing. Part of the 20,000 yuan was confiscated by the Japanese in Yingkou, and the other part has been spent. He is now willing to find a way to repay it after his release from prison. Attorney Yuan Yang'an then stated that according to Article 341, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, crimes of theft committed among relatives require prosecution upon complaint, and according to Article 219 of the Criminal Code, a complaint can be withdrawn before the end of the debate. Since the plaintiff and defendant in this case are relatives, he requested the court to inquire whether the plaintiff wishes to continue the prosecution. The court then summoned Xu Bi to the stand and asked if she wanted to prosecute. She replied that she still wanted to prosecute, but if all the missing items could be returned, she might consider dropping the charges. Attorney Yuan immediately stated that although the defendant could not immediately repay the debt, he could find a guarantor. The court then inquired if there were any relatives of both parties in the courtroom. Mo Lusheng stood up and stated that he was a cousin of Bi Furui, and that this matter concerned relatives, so he should help. However, his personal ability may be insufficient. If all relatives are willing to help, he would have no objection, but the most important question is whether the plaintiff trusts them. However, Xu Bi expressed that she could not trust anyone and insisted on prosecuting. Judge Zhan then ordered the case to continue to be heard. Attorney Yuan also stated that according to Article 378 of the Criminal Code, relatives who commit the crime of receiving stolen goods may be exempt from punishment. Therefore, in this case, everyone except Bi Furui is exempt from punishment. Moreover, the plaintiff and defendant in this case are all relatives, so reconciliation is the best option to avoid hurting each other's feelings. Therefore, he requested the court to grant a sufficient opportunity for both parties to meet and negotiate. Since people have affection when they meet, they may be able to reconcile once they meet. Therefore, he requested that the defendant be allowed to post bail and leave to negotiate a settlement. Judge Zhan then approved this, ordering the case to be rescheduled for one week. Bi Furui was returned to custody, and Wang Fusheng, Bi Yunbo, Bi Yucheng, and Bi Bingxie were allowed to post 500 yuan in cash or surety.</p>

Because there was hope for a settlement, the hearing was rescheduled to the 4th of this month. Details of this were noted in this newspaper. It is now learned that this case has been resolved with the understanding of the Dahu side after influential figures spent several days working on it. Both parties signed a settlement agreement yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM at a certain residence and signed a renewed contract.

<h3>Sanbei Company Plans to Add New Ningbo Route Ship</h3>
<p>Lianhe Ship Purchased from Jardine Matheson</p>
<p>Service to Begin Upon Receipt of the Ship</p>
<p>This year, Sanbei Company is actively expanding its river and sea shipping routes, with a grand plan for business development. Now, it has purchased a ship to add a new Ningbo route. The ship has been purchased and preparations are underway, and service will begin soon. The details are reported below:</p>
<h3>Motives for Expansion</h3>
<p>This year, river and coastal shipping routes have been affected by the sluggish market, resulting in business stagnation. Only the Shanghai-Ningbo route has seen improvement since the cooperation with Taikoo, China Merchants, Ningshao, and others. Both freight and passenger traffic have improved, and all four companies' Ningbo ships are profitable. Based on the current situation, more ships can be added to the Ningbo route to meet the demand for cargo and passengers between Shanghai and Ningbo. Sanbei has now decided to add another ship to the Ningbo route, so that there will be ships sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo every day.</p>
<h3>Purchase of British Ship</h3>
<p>After the company decided to add a Shanghai-Ningbo route ship, it proceeded to purchase a ship. It had to have comfortable cabins, many rooms, fast speed, and smooth sailing to be suitable. It happened that Jardine Matheson's Yangtze River ship, the Lianhe, was for sale. Sanbei received the news and immediately contacted them for purchase. This ship is a sister ship to the China Merchants Bureau's Jianguo. It has a gross tonnage of 2,770 tons, a length of 278 feet and 2 inches, and a width of 43 feet. It has three decks and can travel at a speed of 10 nautical miles per hour. It has first, second, third class, and steerage cabins. It was built in France in 1905 and is in excellent condition, making it ideal for sailing to Ningbo. Both parties have agreed, and the ship price is reportedly 180,000 yuan. Sanbei has already paid part of the payment.</p>
<h3>Preparing for Procedures</h3>
<p>Sanbei is carrying out reforms for all equipment and services provided to passengers on the new Ningbo route. The stewards inside the ship will all be trained, and the number will be fixed at 100 people and not allowed to exceed. The employment of stewards will require a deposit to ensure responsibility and seriousness. After taking over the ship, all levels of cabins inside the ship must be renovated, especially the first-class rooms. Recently, the company has begun actively preparing for various procedures. The Lianhe ship has not yet been delivered. Sanbei will send a ship to operate after receiving the ship. After this, there will be six ships traveling to and from Shanghai and Ningbo, including Daxing's Hongxing ship.</p>
<h3>Jiang Jinshan Dies Bravely Capturing Thief</h3>
<p>Autopsy of Body Performed Yesterday</p>
<p>Authorities Plan to Provide Compensation</p>
<p>In front of number 72, Ronghua Lane, Malong Road, French Concession, at around 10 AM the day before yesterday, a robbery occurred. Liu Caiyou (38 years old, Ningbo native), a rent collector for Yipin Bank, was robbed of 688 yuan in cash and a check for 52 yuan. The robber fled with the loot. Because Liu pursued and shouted "Catch the robber!", detectives who heard the alarm rushed to intercept him. The robber fled into Kangti Road and Nanshan Road, and then came out of the lane, in front of the Shengkang Pawnshop at the entrance of the alley. At that time, Jiang Jinshan, a Shaoxing native (28 years old) living at number 78, Hengqing Lane, Beile Road, who had previously worked as a servant, was passing by. Hearing bystanders shouting "Robber," and that the robber was holding a fake gun, Jiang rushed forward to try to grab the robber. Seeing the urgency of the situation, the robber immediately took out his gun and fired four shots to resist arrest. One bullet hit Jiang's right breast in front of his chest, piercing through and exiting from his back. Realizing he had been shot, he stopped chasing and retreated westward, falling to the ground at the intersection of Malong Road and Kangti Road. One bullet hit Li Datao, an Anhui native passing by, in the left leg, causing him to fall to the ground. At this time, the robber threw the stolen cash to the ground to escape the chase. As a result, he fled into Shunyang Lane, Caishi Road, and was finally captured by detectives.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Case of Theft by a Service Worker of the City Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Colluding in Theft by Abusing Position</p>
<p>Lin Peng and Other Police Officers Sentenced and Ordered to Pay Compensation</p>
<p>Lin Peng, a service worker at the Inspection Department of the City Public Security Bureau, based on a report from an informant, Zhu Qinggen, led police officers Yu Yongxin, Ji Sigong, Li Jinbang, Li Genyi, Zhao Yushan, Gao Zhijiang, Bin Dong YuKun, and others to Chenjiamen, Pudong, to search the home of Xi Futang, who is now the head of the security group, for a counterfeit currency machine. As a result, they found nothing. Afterwards, Xi Futang discovered that 1,050 yuan in cash, a gold watch, a gold chain, two gold pounds, and two gold rings were missing. Xi immediately filed a report with the headquarters of the group, which was forwarded to the Public Security Bureau. Director Wen of the bureau believed that Lin Peng and others were suspected of theft. Except for Gao Zhijiang, Bin Dong Yukun, Chen Zicheng, and Xiao Sanzi, who were at large, Lin and others were sent to the prosecution office of the local court for investigation and prosecution in the criminal court. After the debate ended, they waited for the verdict. Details of this case have been reported previously. It is now learned that Judge Zhang Peiming held a court session the day before yesterday to announce the verdict. Lin Peng, Yu Yongxin, and others were ordered to be brought to the stand. After a brief interrogation, the presiding judge announced in court that Lin Peng was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for colluding in theft by abusing his position. Yu Yongxin was sentenced to one year and eight months of imprisonment for abusing his position. Zhu Qinggen was sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment for colluding in theft. Ji Sigong and Li Genyi were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment for colluding in theft. Li Jinbang and Zhao Yushan were each sentenced to three years of imprisonment for receiving stolen goods. Lin Peng, Yu Yongxin, Zhu Qinggen, Li Jinbang, and Zhao Yushan shall be jointly liable for compensating Xi Futang 600 yuan. Xi Futang's remaining civil claims were rejected. The trial procedure for Gao Zhijiang, Bin Dong Yukun, Chen Zicheng, and Xiao Sanzi, who are at large, was suspended. After the presiding judge announced the verdict, Lin Peng and others declared in court that they were not satisfied with the verdict. The presiding judge ordered them to appeal according to law within the statutory period and ordered them to be returned to custody separately.</p>
<p>He threw the seized cash to the ground to relieve the pressure of the pursuit, resulting in his escape into Shunyang Lane on Caishi Road, where detectives caught him and took his pistol. He was found with a one-yuan banknote from the Bank of China Industry and a check for 52 yuan from Hefeng Qianzhuang issued by Yushang Silk Factory dated August 9. He confessed that his name was Gu Youting, 33 years old, from Shaoxing, and that he had previously committed a kidnapping case in the Public Concession and was sentenced to ten years in prison. He was released last year and had come to Shanghai on a morning train from Hangzhou with a gun that day to commit the robbery. The chief detective ordered detectives to take the robber to the scene of the incident to demonstrate the robbery, escape, and resistance to arrest, and then bring him back to the police station for detention pending further investigation. Meanwhile, the police station sent officers to send the injured Jiang and Li to Guangci Hospital. Jiang died of his injuries before he could be treated. His body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for autopsy. Yesterday morning, the police sent the robber to the Second Special Court, where Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the First Criminal Court. First, Attorney Yao Zhaodi of the police station stated the case and requested an extension for investigation before filing a formal charge. He also presented the seized gun, bullets, check, and banknotes. Then, Detective Wu Wengang reported the course of events of the robbery, resistance to arrest, and arrest of the defendant. The court verified the check and questioned the defendant before ordering him to be returned to custody pending further investigation. At noon, Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan of the Second Special Court, accompanied by a forensic doctor and a clerk, arrived at the autopsy site. The autopsy confirmed that the deceased, Jiang Jinshan, had been shot and killed while resisting the robber before his death. He presided over a public trial, where Detective Zhang Chunsheng reported the case. The deceased's mother, Jiang Qian (53 years old), complained that her son had died a tragic death and asked for justice. The official questioned the witnesses, Liu Caiyou and Chen Shunjin, who watched the alley, about the robbery and the circumstances of the deceased's death before ordering the body to be handed over to the deceased's mother, Jiang Qian, for burial. It was also rumored that the police station, in view of the deceased's tragic death while helping to capture the robber and his family's poverty, would provide compensation. However, the deceased had an elderly mother, wife, and children who depended on him for support, and the family's life would inevitably become difficult.</p>
<h3>570,000 Worth of Toys Imported in Six Months</h3>
<p>A Record Amidst the National Crisis</p>
<p>Although our country is in a time of great national crisis, people are still playing and unawakened. Some even call for "saving the country without forgetting entertainment." This is further evidenced by the International Trade Bureau's announcement this morning that the import of games and toys has surged. In the first six months of this year, the import of games and toys was 292,195 gold units, equivalent to 577,962 yuan in national currency. Compared with the import of 233,188 gold units in the first six months of last year, there has been a significant increase. In June alone, imports were 32,922 gold units, equivalent to 67,424 yuan in national currency. Such a record amidst a severe national crisis is truly regrettable.</p>

<h3>City Government Approves Ministry of Industry's Interpretation of the Nature of Factory Workers</h3>
<p>The City Government has approved the Ministry of Industry's consultation and interpretation of the nature of workers in factories, which shall be conveyed to the Bureau of Social Affairs. The case was approved by the Ministry of Industry's Labor No. 3012 document, which states: "In accordance with the previous consultation from your Municipal Government, reported by the Bureau of Social Affairs, concerning the interpretation of the nature of workers by the Judicial Yuan, which seems to narrow the scope of application of the Factory Law, we hereby request a re-interpretation after review, and a consultation will be sent to be checked accordingly. The Executive Yuan has issued instruction No. 3395, which states: "In accordance with the Ministry's request for a re-interpretation of the ambiguities regarding the nature of workers, we have forwarded this to the Judicial Yuan for a prompt interpretation and reply, and instructions for notification. We have now received a response from the Judicial Yuan stating, "This case has been resolved by the Council for the Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations of this Yuan, stating that Article 1 of the Factory Law is a provision for factories that are universally subject to the Factory Law. The phrase 'ordinarily employing 30 or more workers' in that article refers to the ordinary employment of 30 or more workers that is of a continuous nature. Therefore, a factory that has reached this statutory number of employees meets the qualifications of Article 1 of the Factory Law and should be subject to the Factory Law. Since this factory should be subject to the Factory Law, workers hired by the piece or by the day, regardless of whether they are of a mobile nature, are also naturally subject to the law, in addition to the above-mentioned 30 employees. Interpretation No. 532 of the Yuan is only an interpretation of the phrase 'ordinarily employing 30 or more workers' in Article 1 of the law, and does not mean that non-monthly workers working in the above-mentioned factories are not subject to the Factory Law. As for workers under the contracting system and workers paid by the piece or by the day, if the content of their contracts does not necessarily terminate upon the completion of each type of work, each piece of work, or each day's work, and is only used as a standard for calculating wages, it is naturally different from temporary employment and should be regarded as workers of a continuous nature. We hereby respond to your Yuan for review and instruction." The Ministry received this instruction, and apart from distribution, we also consulted for your reference and requested that you be informed. The Ministry approved this. In accordance with the previous report submitted by the Bureau, the Ministry approved a reply and issued an order for notification. Now, in accordance with the previous instruction, we hereby instruct the Bureau to be informed of this order. The Bureau of Social Affairs, after receiving the order, has instructed China Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. to comply with the instructions.</p>
<h3>City Finance Bureau Decides to Collect Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax According to Regulations</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, due to the overcrowding of tobacco and alcohol merchants applying for licenses at various tax collection offices in the city recently, the Finance Bureau has issued a notice extending the deadline for applications by seven days until August 7th, in order to facilitate those who have not had time to apply for licenses. Those who fail to apply for licenses after the deadline will be penalized according to regulations. Regarding the collection of taxes in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry, the Finance Bureau's attitude is extremely firm. According to the person in charge of the bureau, this tax must be collected in accordance with the regulations and cannot be reduced to accommodate anyone. The reasons have been repeatedly published in various newspapers and need not be repeated. However, many tobacco and alcohol merchants say that collecting taxes in accordance with the regulations will increase the burden. They do not know that falsely reporting grades and paying less taxes in the past were illegal acts and cannot be used as examples. The current correction is only in accordance with the regulations and cannot be compared to increasing taxes. Even if we take a step back, for stores that have been corrected this time, the tax amount for each quarter may be a few yuan more than before, but because of this, the price of tobacco and alcohol may be slightly increased, and the increased tax may not be able to be compensated by the purchasers. If it is said that increasing the price will affect business, each industry itself will naturally use this as an excuse. However, tobacco and alcohol are not the same as ordinary items, and those who sell tobacco and alcohol cannot be compared to ordinary businesses. This is because tobacco and alcohol are highly addictive, and the lower the price, the more people will buy them, and the more harm it will cause to society. If the price is increased due to heavy taxes, those who use more will use less, and those who use less will not use it at all. Wouldn't it be a blessing for the country and society if the number of people who drink and smoke heavily gradually decreases? (The cheaper the tobacco and alcohol, the more addictive it is. If the price increases, the poor will not be able to afford it, and they will be able to quit their addictions, which will benefit their personal health and economy.) Therefore, collecting tobacco and alcohol license tax is intended to regulate the industry and cannot be compromised. Moreover, it is being handled in accordance with the regulations set by the Ministry, so why should there be a request for a tax reduction? Since the city took over the business, more than 1,000 licenses have been issued to stores whose reports have been verified as accurate. Except for a portion that has not yet been verified, the reports that do not match are corrected as much as possible, and the tax is paid retroactively in accordance with the regulations. Each quarter, only two or three thousand yuan is collected more, and each year, only about ten thousand yuan is collected, which is not a large subsidy for the city treasury. If it is thought that collecting taxes in accordance with the regulations is purely to increase revenue, then it is a big mistake. Furthermore, the city spends a huge amount of money each year on hygiene, security, and other expenses. If more citizens drink and smoke heavily, it will affect their personal health and economy and reduce their productivity. It will also indirectly increase the expenditure on hygiene and security in the city. The annual tobacco and alcohol license tax is only tens of thousands of yuan, which is not enough to cover the expenses incurred as a result. Therefore, for the sake of the happiness of the majority of citizens, the government hopes that citizens will drink less and smoke less, and does not hope that the tobacco and alcohol license tax will decrease.</p>
<h3>Hometown Gentleman Hu Lifu Leaves an Estate of 700,000 to 800,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Married Daughters Request Division</p>
<p>Hu Renfeng, courtesy name Lifu, a former township director of Fahua and a member of the Shanghai County Assembly, resided in Tangzijing behind the Xujiahui Station in Shanghai West. He passed away on January 11th of this year. He had one son and four daughters. The eldest daughter, Hongfen, married Jiang; the second daughter, Lanzhen, married Xu; the third daughter, Luzhu, married Huang (who passed away in 1922, leaving a son named Huang Huimin, who is now inheriting); and the fourth daughter, Wanxiang, married Ye. The son, Wenbing, previously studied in France and obtained a doctorate in law. After returning to China, he is now working as a section chief in the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the capital and as a professor at the Central University. However, Lifu owned over 100 mu of farmland in Fahua and Songqing during his lifetime, as well as deposits in various banks, totaling no less than 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. All of these have been concealed and occupied by his son, Hu Wenbing, who refuses to hand them over. He has also used threats to force his sisters to sign written statements, intending to swallow the entire estate. Relatives have repeatedly stepped in to mediate, but Hu Wenbing and his wife have no sincerity and are only敷衍(being evasive). It is now learned that Jiang Hu Hongfen, Ye Hu Wanxiang, and nephew Huang Huimin, et al., have hired lawyers to file a lawsuit in court against Hu Wenbing for the division of the estate.</p>
<h3>National Aviation Propaganda Team Will Pass Through Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Road to Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Propaganda Conducted in Villages Along the Way</p>
<p>National Tour Lasts Two and a Half Years</p>
<p>Chen Zhenglong, the former commander of the Independent Brigade of the Northeastern National Salvation Army, has, since returning from the Northeast, recognized the importance of aviation construction. He has gathered more than ten comrades and organized the National Aviation Propaganda Team with self-funded expenses to awaken compatriots and inspire them to strive for strength. In June of this year, after approval from the central government, he came to Shanghai from the capital to engage in propaganda work. He will soon leave for Zhejiang. The details are reported as follows.</p>
<h3>Advertising Purpose and Scheduled Itinerary</h3>
<p>The group's purpose is to promote national salvation through aviation, roughly divided into three points: (1) the progress of the war in the Northeast; (2) the reasons for the failure of the National Army;</p>
<p>(3) the relationship between the air force and national defense. The scheduled route is from Beijing to Shanghai, then along the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to Hangzhou, through the entire province of Zhejiang, to Jiangsu, then to Anhui, Henan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Tibet, Mongolia, Qinghai, Suiyuan, Chahar, Hebei, Shandong, Fujian, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Sichuan. It will then travel eastward along the Yangtze River back to Beijing. The propaganda period is set for two and a half years, with extensions as needed. The goal is to encourage the people to donate funds to the government to expand air defense.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Preparations Completed, Soon to Depart for Zhejiang</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, under the guidance of the Municipal Party Headquarters, they carried out publicity at the People's Education Center, Xiaoshijie, the Republic Theatre, Fu'an Amusement Park, and Zhabei. They distributed slogans and once requested the Aviation Association to negotiate with the concession authorities to facilitate the propaganda. However, no satisfactory response has been received to date. The group is now urging the Aviation Association to negotiate again to realize their ambitions. However, whether the concessions will be sympathetic is still difficult to predict. As the group has stayed in Shanghai for a long time, they plan to leave Shanghai as a whole, travel to Hangzhou on foot via the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and conduct similar propaganda in the villages along the way. However, they will not stay long in each place.</p>
<h3>China Economic Credit Cooperative Expands Solicitation, Deadline Extended</h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Economic Credit Cooperative has been soliciting new members for two months. The fourth announcement was made on July 31st. Despite the summer heat, the group secretaries and team leaders have been actively soliciting members, and the results have been quite impressive. However, due to the exceptionally hot weather this year, the solicitation process has been quite challenging. The team leaders have requested an extension to exceed the original quota. The fifth board meeting decided to extend the final announcement to September 15th to allow the team leaders to continue their efforts during the cooler autumn season, hoping to achieve complete success.</p>
<h3>Charity Association Takes Over Zhabei Reformatory</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Child Welfare Association, since agreeing to take over the Zhabei Civilian Reformatory, has been actively proceeding with the various procedures, which have now been completed. On August 1st, the association appointed its directors Zhu Guanyi, Zhang Yueru, and Zhao Jian to take over the reformatory. The handover is currently in progress. The reformatory has an existing fund of 80,000 yuan and a monthly income of approximately 600 yuan, which is insufficient to cover various expenses. In the future, the Child Welfare Association will provide an additional subsidy of 400 yuan per month. The director of the reformatory will be assumed by Xu Jianping, the general director of the Child Welfare Association. If Mr. Xu is unable to manage due to his many responsibilities in the Ministry of Finance, Chen Tiesheng, the deputy general director, will take over. Wang Guanyi will be responsible for educational affairs.</p>

<h3>Reporting Requirements for Resignations of Committee Members from Chambers of Commerce and Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau issued an instruction to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that it had received Instruction No. 10221 from the Municipal Government, which quoted Document No. 26966 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce: "Upon investigation, committee members of chambers of commerce and trade associations in various regions sometimes resign midway due to the provisions of Article 22 of the Chamber of Commerce Law. According to Articles 15 and 24 of the Implementing Rules of the same law, executive committee members should be immediately replaced, or standing committee members and chairmen should be re-elected, and according to Article 20 of the same law and Article 25 of its Implementing Rules, the chairman, standing committee members, or executive committee members should report for record within 15 days of taking office. It has been found that while most chambers of commerce and trade associations in various regions comply with the law when such situations occur, some delay or neglect to report until the re-election, only then providing a supplementary explanation of the facts. It is also unavoidable that there are mid-term changes that are not reported, resulting in discrepancies between the names on the re-election roster. This is not only inconsistent with the law, but also makes the investigation and verification process more difficult. In the future, when merchant groups experience committee resignations, replacements, or re-elections, they must promptly report the matter to the competent authorities for submission to the Ministry for record, in accordance with the law, to facilitate investigation and verification. In addition to issuing a separate consultation, you are requested to investigate and comply with the matter." The order instructs the chamber to comply and instruct its affiliated trade associations to comply accordingly.</p>

<h3>Silk Prices Plummet, Three Silk Factories Close Yesterday</h3>
<p>More to Announce Closures Next Week</p>
<p>Silk Merchants and Workers Hope Government Will Quickly Seek Relief</p>
<p>The 30 silk reeling factories in the city that are barely operating are suffering heavy losses due to the repeated sharp falls in silk prices in Europe and America. Jiyu and two other silk factories on Gonghe Road closed yesterday. Other factories in operation will also gradually close within a week. The future is very worrying. Silk merchants earnestly hope that the government will quickly find relief measures. The situation is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Three Operating Silk Factories Already Closed</h3>
<p>Since the spring cocoon season began, 33 factories勉强started operations: 6 in the Hongkou district, including Heji and Zhongyuan; 13 in the Zhabei railway north area, including Fuchang, Yutai, and Gongda; 11 in the Xinzha district, including Yuxing, Hongsheng, and Yonghe; and 3 in the concession area, including Yuyuan and Jingwei. Due to the repeated sharp falls in silk prices in Europe and America, each担of reeled silk has to亏洋100 yuan. Factories that have been in operation for less than a month have already lost more than 20,000 yuan. In this situation, it is difficult to maintain operations. Yesterday, Jiyu on Gonghe Road, Yutong on Meiyuan Road, and Yingfeng on Tanjiabing Road declared their closure. This involves a total of 720车头and over 1,300 unemployed workers.</p>
<h3>More to Announce Closures Next Week</h3>
<p>The remaining 30 silk factories including Heji, Liyuan, Xiangcheng on Tiantong Road, Yifeng on Miaotou Road, Detai, Xiexing on Zhangjiagang Road, Dafeng, Fulun on Tianbao Road, Fengtai on Dayang Bridge, Yuxing on Hengfeng Road, Hongsheng, Yongli, Zhongguo Xinji on Chang'an Road, Meifeng on Gonghe Road, Yuanyuan on Yutong Road, Hengcang on Miaotou Road, and Yuyuan, Jingwei on Alabaster Road. A part of the silk factory north of the railroad is able to maintain operations because they reel silk for customers. The rest of the factory in Hongkou, Xinzha, Concession districts will gradually shut down. Most factories has already gave out worker's salary and get ready to shutdown.</p>
<h3>The silk business earnestly hope for government relief</h3>
<p>The 大公社reporter inquired about the views of the silk industry yesterday. It is said that the recent slump in silk prices can be described as unprecedented. If relief is not sought urgently, the industry will be completely bankrupt. The livelihoods of silkworm farmers, silk merchants, and silk workers will be affected, involving no less than millions of people. The only urgent solution is to ask the government to follow the example of the relief to the silk industry in 1919, where the government subsidizes 100 yuan for each担of raw silk exported, so that silk merchants can barely maintain operations and factories in operation will not have to close. Or ask the government to designate banks to accept pledges at low interest rates to facilitate the economy. The fundamental solution is to implement various controls as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Disturbances Arise Frequently When Competing for Work</h3>
<p>The total number of silk industry workers in the city is about 80,000. Since being unemployed in August of last year, they have no way to make a living. Although there are currently 30 silk factories that are barely operating, they only employ more than 13,000 workers, leaving the majority of workers still unemployed. Currently, in the silk factories operating in various districts, disturbances frequently arise due to workers competing for work. Last month, several silk factories on Chang'an Road experienced conflicts due to the large number of workers despite the allocation. Fortunately, the Sixth District Silk Workers' Union heard the news and rushed to persuade them, and the situation was quelled. The 大公社reporter met with Yuan Yunlong, the director of the Sixth District Silk Workers' Union, yesterday, who said that he read in the newspaper that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will send people to Shanghai to investigate the silk industry. He hopes that they will conduct on-site inspections to understand the truth. Otherwise, thousands of workers will also go to Beijing to petition and personally present their case to the authorities, requesting relief.</p>
<h3>Bank Holiday</h3>

<p>Next Monday, August 6th, is a bank holiday. The Municipal Council will be closed on this day.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's band is scheduled to hold a concert in Zhaofeng Park from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM to entertain visitors.</p>
<h3>Child Welfare Association Letter to Provincial Civil Affairs Departments and Municipal Social Affairs Bureaus</h3>
<p>Request to Recommend Child Welfare Leaders</p>
<p>Representing the Conference</p>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association, in order to develop the child welfare cause in China, decided to hold a National Child Welfare Leaders Conference in Shanghai from October 10th to 13th this year. The preparatory committee members Zhao Jinqing, Luo Yunyan, Lu Bohong, Chen Heqin, Ding Shujing, and the directors Chen Tiesheng and Zhou Chucai have been actively preparing.

The original letter is recorded below: "Dear Sir/Madam, The child welfare cause in our country is still in its infancy. The organizations in various regions are not yet systematic, and the methods and steps are difficult to unify. To seek development, we must gather child welfare leaders from all over the country, widely solicit opinions, formulate plans, and proceed step by step. Therefore, the association's standing committee decided to hold a National Child Welfare Leaders Conference in Shanghai from October 10th to 13th this year. We would like to request that your department recommend one or two leaders in the field of child welfare in your region to attend the conference and provide guidance. At the same time, the association will specially invite child education experts and child health physicians to attend and provide guidance. However, as this is a pioneering effort, we deeply rely on the support of all parties. We have long admired the Director of your department for treating the people as children and always cherishing the hearts of the young, loving the country like home, deeply understanding the meaning of caring for the young. We believe that you will agree with this grand event. We are sending this letter together with the attachments for your review. Please fill in the names, ages, and affiliations of the selected representatives in the form and reply as soon as possible so that we can compile the list of names and jointly support the event. We look forward to your reply."</p>

<h3>Business Community on Fangxie Road Requests Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>Eight buildings located at the corner of the Fangxie Road and Chen Yingshi Pagoda in Nanshi Ximen are the property of Zhuang Xianghe. They were rebuilt and completed at the end of 1933. In January 1934, they were leased to tenants to open businesses. At that time, the rental prices were assessed by the Municipal Finance Bureau, which was considered fair. Later, the landlord charged excessive rent. The business community hoped that business would flourish and compensate for the high rent. Unexpectedly, although business in the Ximen area has developed slightly on the surface, it is secretly unsustainable. The reason is that the high rent is the biggest factor. If the rent can be reduced according to the city's standard for rent reduction, it can be maintained with difficulty. The stores in the area, Huizhong Printing House, Shanghai Restaurant, Meihua Department Store, Park Bed Room, Jishi Distributor, Daxin Printing Bureau, Dong Sanhe Pen and Ink Shop, and Fushun Copper and Iron Bed Factory, have taken the lead in signing their names and writing a letter to the Western Region Business Federation, requesting that it forward the letter to the landlord Zhuang Xianghe, requesting him to sympathize with the difficulties of the business community and approve a rent reduction of 60% according to the city's regulations. Unexpectedly, after the federation sent the letter, the landlord not only ignored it but also treated the tenants as if they could be deceived. He appointed lawyer Wang Chengkuan to send letters to the tenants, ordering them to pay the rent in arrears or vacate the house. After receiving the letter, the tenants were outraged and held an emergency meeting at the Xicheng Business Federation at 8:00 PM yesterday to discuss countermeasures. They publicly elected Cao Mo, the representative of Huizhong, as the chairman to report on how to deal with the landlord's oppressive measures in response to the tenants' request for rent reduction and asked the public for a decision. The entire body decided on the following measures: (1) Each tenant will directly write another letter to the landlord, expressing their sincerity; (2) If the landlord still ignores the letter, rent will be suspended from the date of the letter; (3) Cao Mo and Gao Zixin are appointed as negotiating representatives; (4) Wu Kaisheng and Li Ming are hired as legal advisors to deal with the matter in accordance with the law; (5) Request the Chenghuang Business Federation to mediate and provide assistance to the end; (6) Organize the Xicheng Business Community Rent Reduction Promotion Association to notify the business community in the Xicheng area to participate and expand the organization to achieve the final victory; (7) Print slogans with the eight characters "No rent reduction, stop paying rent"; (8) Publish a declaration stating the reasons for the rent reduction and submit it to the higher-level Rent Reduction Committee for record. The above measures were unanimously approved. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Rent Reduction Association's Petition</h3>
<p>The Nanshi Rent Reduction Committee recently realized that the landlords insisted on their own opinions, and the tenants' savings were deposited in various banks, amounting to more than 200,000 yuan. If this continues for a long time, it will become a protracted situation. To circulate funds and regulate the market, it suggested that the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau temporarily use the unresolved rent reduction funds for the Social Affairs Bureau's civilian lending capital. The original petition is recorded as follows: "Rent reduction voices are common throughout Shanghai. Landlords insist on their own opinions, and tenants deposit rent in banks, going to extremes. The association has been established for several months now, led by the Party discipline above and entrusted by the citizens below. Since the beginning, there are few who have generously agreed to reduce rent. Most landlords, seeing only profit, disregard the difficulties of the business community. Food, clothing, housing, and transportation are valued by the late premier. The other three items can be compressed by individual abilities, but Shanghai has always paid little attention to housing and allowed the landlords to exploit them, resulting in today's market situation, which is regrettable. The association aims to provide the citizens of the entire district with a place to live and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. It is a compromise to promote the prosperity of the market. Unfortunately, our mind and body are exhausted, and it is difficult to achieve success. Our efforts have not been extended to the whole of Shanghai. Landlords insist on their opinions, and tenants deposit rent in banks. This will be a protracted matter. The purpose of the association is to regulate the market and maintain the people's livelihood. At this time when the market is declining and financial constraints are severe, it is proposed to temporarily use the rent that has not been resolved for rent reduction as the Social Affairs Bureau's civilian lending capital to circulate social funds and maintain the livelihood of the poor. It may be of some help to the local security. When the landlord resolves the rent reduction, it will be the day when the rent is extracted, and the tenants will also withdraw their deposits and benefit the civilians. It is a win-win situation. We respectfully submit this brief outline for your review and adoption, which will be a true blessing. We respectfully submit, etc."</p>

(5) The Nanyang Pharmacy and the Cerulean Foreign Firm had a dispute over the sale of "替所可耳". It was decided to first ask the colleagues to mediate.

<h3>Medical World</h3>
<p>Lu Tingzhi and His Son Are Skilled at Treating External Ailments. The famous doctor Lu Tingzhi and his son, Dr. Lu Zhenhua, have a clinic in Baoqingli, Nanchengda Lane, specializing in surgery and treating throat ailments. Countless people have been cured. For example, Zhong Hailiang, the foreman of the British American Tobacco Company, suffered from a peritonsillar abscess, and the wife of Mr. Ding Yinglong of the Park Union Firm on Beijing Road suffered from scrofula. Numerous Chinese and Western doctors were consulted, but none were effective. Both were treated by Dr. Zhenhua, and the diseases disappeared within a few weeks. Due to the hot weather, the clinic hours have been moved earlier, it is said.</p>
<p>News from the Hu She Clinic. The Hu She Clinic has been established for more than half a year. The Chinese and Western doctors there are well-known in Shanghai. In recent days, the number of patients seeking treatment has increased. They also provide diagnosis and medicine to the poor and sick without charging a penny. Fellow villagers from Huzhou and nearby citizens have benefited from this. Dr. Shen Xinfu, a Chinese medicine doctor in the Traditional Chinese Medicine department, is concerned that poor members of the society cannot afford to see a doctor when they are sick. In addition to still coming to the society on time for consultations, if a poor member needs him to see them due to illness, even outside of his consultation hours, they can obtain a certificate from the registration office of the clinic and go to him for treatment. If the illness is serious and he needs to be called to their home, all consultation fees, registration fees, and transportation costs will be waived, greatly benefiting the poor. The previously issued preferential tickets will be canceled to limit the service. The society has notified all members, it is said.</p>

<h3>How to Watch Movies (Continued)</h3>
<p>3.  5 The Colorful Chinese Film Industry</p>
<p>In China, although the development of the film industry is a recent phenomenon, it has bypassed the processes that European and American films went through. The difference is that Chinese films are just following the tail of European and American films. European and American films actively fulfilled the task of destroying feudal social consciousness, while Chinese films are still spokespersons for feudal society. The development of European and American films has a certain order, while Chinese films are produced without order or organization. From "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" to "Song of the Fishermen," everything can be seen in the same period.</p>
<p>Thus, the colorful nature of the current Chinese film industry has formed. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Whispers of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Passing through a partition, although this partition is very thin, its material is also made of teak, and it is carved very delicately. Outside is a larger room, which is the so-called "little court on the train." If only discussing its size, of course, there is nothing worth mentioning, but in terms of its layout and decoration, it is truly luxurious to the extreme. I can start with a summary: In order to pursue beauty, in order to pursue comfort, in order to make it able to provide us with the performance of all court ceremonies as much as possible, no matter how much money it costs, we will never hesitate!</p>
<p>The first thing that can attract attention is four vases of fresh flowers, which are placed in the four corners of this small court. Each is supported by a very exquisite and tall wooden frame. The vases themselves are, of course, valuable antiques, and the colored patterns and styles are extremely antique and beautiful. The vases are filled with four different kinds of fresh flowers: the first is peony, also known as the flower of wealth, and is known as the queen of flowers in China. The Empress Dowager may especially like it because their positions are somewhat similar. The second is nandina, which can be regarded as a unique plant in the East, with green leaves and red berries like coral, which is really extremely beautiful. The third is forsythia, whose color is as yellow as gold, which happens to represent a special color used by the imperial family. The fourth is pear blossom, all white, slightly green, with a bit of purity. These four kinds of flowers are all common in spring, but the original intention of using them to decorate this small court is not only because they are spring flowers, but because they all have a kind of durable survival power, and even if they are inserted in a vase with not much water, they will not wither; moreover, they can also rely on the nourishment of these turbid waters to constantly grow leaves, grow buds, and continue to bloom.

<h3>The Waitresses of Lanxi</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Waitress, what moving sounds those three syllables make!</p>
<p>Snow-white oval face, blood-red lips, curved and long eyebrows, lively eyes, this is the epitome of a waitress. Every day, every hour, groups of young men are drunk under their eyes and collapse under their blood-red lips.</p>
<p>However, the waitresses in our Lanxi are slightly different, and there are no mysterious cafes. There are only some tea shops. There are more than a dozen tea tables in each tea shop, and the so-called waitresses are also in there.</p>
<p>Therefore, waitresses are actually female waiters. Although their ages are also in their youth, they are all girls in their twenties. However, the difference is that they do not have silk long cheongsams, let alone Parisian rouge or Parisian perfume. They don't have the dress of a modern girl at all. Most of them wear short clothes, but they rely on their skills and their innate faces, so either their doors are like a marketplace, or their carriages are rare, but this point is the same.</p>
<p>They solicit customers and are good at soliciting customers. They will pull everyone passing by the door in. In addition to drinking tea in the tea shop, there are also melon seeds served in dishes. The dishes are shallow, and the melon seeds are piled in a very artistic way, just enough to cover the bottom of the dish, no more, no less. The tea customers only eat a few melon seeds, and a dish is finished. But the second dish is immediately served. The tea shop uses this way to make money, and the melon seed money alone is very considerable each time they drink tea. As for the guests, they can freely have fun with the girls at this time, and touch them, which is also the same as in the city. Therefore, many tea customers prefer to choose quieter shops. There are fewer tea customers, and the service is naturally more attentive, and these friends whose real purpose is not tea are naturally satisfied. It is said that in this small city of Lanxi, there are hundreds of people, young and old, who are immersed in such tea shops day and night.</p>
<h3>At the Window</h3>
<p>— Dingming</p>
<p>Supporting my weak body, gently shaking the palm-leaf fan, I still stand at the window of this place that I am about to leave.</p>
<p>Suddenly raising my head, I gaze at the "matching eaves" of the people across the street a few yards away. A row of several windows are open; the light green light reflects the dark green room, so soft and touching; on the street, a car passes by every once in a while, interrupting the "chatter" of pedestrians; it is still that young woman of the leisure class, the milky-white top setting off her black hair; hiding in the shadow of the window lattice of the half-concealed street lamp.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I hear a crisp sound, scolding coquettishly; it turns out that the woman is interrupting the seven- or eight-year-old prostitute under the window; playing; then she throws down three copper coins in succession, "clang! … clang! … clang! …"</p>
<p>That young seedling who fell into the fire pit—the "flower in the latrine"—the little girl follows the old hag who picked up the copper coins and walks away in the dark. The young woman of the leisure class, the bit of black hair set off by the milky-white top, crawls lower and lower, lower and lower, more and more bent; probably following the receding figure of the little prostitute, stretching her sight; perhaps out of curiosity, perhaps out of regret!—No, looking at her so quiet, like a figure in a painting, she is clearly sympathizing.</p>
<p>I, dragging my weak body, lie on the sofa, my heart waving with question marks, and thinking again: "Oh! This ordinary woman, only that 'clang! clang! clang!' six-syllable three copper coins of sympathy; I don't know what kind of sympathy the 'female great person' who takes on the leader of the women's movement has!"</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 32: The General Amuses Himself with Sensual Pleasures All Day Long; Few Soldiers Return Amidst the Weeping of the Old and Young</p>
<p>After the two men had cried for a while, they saw Zhao Weng put on a stern face, and went back with a huff. He took a hand towel and slammed it on the table, saying, "There is really no justice in this world! Fighting and defending the front line are the business of the battalion commander and the company commander, while enjoying happiness is the business of their military commander and division commander. Not to mention the three eastern provinces, China should have been destroyed long ago." Gui Zhi expected that the old man had run into a snag, so she held back her tears and stepped forward, asking calmly, "Didn't you see him?" Zhao Weng said, "If I really didn't see him, then I would have considered myself lucky. Guess what? When I went, I caught him and his concubine eating snacks. The heating pipes in the building were really hot. I was wearing a fur robe and was dripping with sweat, but his two sons were wearing only single-layered clothes, smiling and eating from large jars and small plates, piled all over the table. Several young and well-dressed maids were standing beside them, serving them. I immediately thought to myself, we are all soldiers, why do some people get to enjoy happiness at home like this, while others have to fight in the ice and snow? Just based on this point, I was angry. When he saw me, he didn't even move his head. It was as if he didn't see me at all. When I got there, I had no choice but to give him three deep bows. Only then did he look at me and say, 'Old man, didn't you come to inquire about your son's news?' I said, 'Yes, does the division commander know how he is now?' What do you want to do? After he said this, he didn't say anything. First, he laughed and then said, 'When we send troops to fight, how can the rear know clearly about the survival of a company commander? You don't have to worry about this. In case your son sacrifices himself, our concubine is still short of someone who is sensible to serve her, so you can send your daughter-in-law to me.' I saw the indecent look on his face, and I really didn't want to say anything more to him. Besides, although our family is poor, it's not to the point where we have to go to his house to beg for a bowl of rice. I reluctantly thanked him and came out." (448)</p>
<p>The worker said, "If we cut off these small branches, the sides of the road will already look pretty good."</p>
<h3>Old Zhang's Philosophy</h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>Old Zhang is an elementary school teacher in a certain town. His art of dealing with the world is very clever, so everyone thinks he is a person who studies the philosophy of life. Old Zhang likes women very much, but he can't write love letters, so every time he receives a love letter, he secretly copies a few paragraphs from the theories in "A Collection of Love Letters" and mails them out. As a result, the general girlfriends think that he is learned in both Chinese and Western cultures, and rich in talent. Everyone is happy to associate with him. This is his philosophy for dealing with women.</p>
<p>Old Zhang doesn't have any profound research on education, but he likes to publish educational papers. He doesn't hesitate to spend a lot of money to ask someone to write them for him. After they are done, he signs Old Zhang's name and sends them to magazines that discuss educational issues for publication. In this way, Old Zhang is an educator. Everyone knows it, and no one doesn't know it. The job is even more secure. This is Old Zhang's philosophy for maintaining his position. Old Zhang also treats friends differently. He always invites friends with status to smoke Beautiful brand cigarettes, ordinary friends to smoke Golden Mouse brand cigarettes, and the least important friends, sorry, he will have to offer them a one-copper-coin-a-piece cigarette. Therefore, he always has three kinds of cigarettes in his pocket, hidden separately. When he sees who is coming, he offers that kind of cigarette. This is his philosophy for dealing with friends.</p>
<p>Old Zhang's philosophy is very clever. Due to space limitations, it cannot be fully described.</p>

<p>The Back Lake is the Xuanwu Lake of the capital. It is located outside Xuanwu Gate (i.e., Fengrun Gate) and has a circumference of about forty li. Whenever it is the spring season, the weeping willows sway with the wind, as if they are kissing the lake water, and the apricot blossoms smile at the passers-by.</p>
<p>With such beautiful scenery, it is enough for us to linger; but there are also fresh and tender snow lotus roots and finely glutinous fox nuts, which are really the only gifts for tourists!</p>
<p>The most famous is a kind of fat crucian carp, because the water there is clear, and there are also delicious snow lotus roots and water caltrops as bait, so it can eat its fill all day long, and the meat naturally tastes fat and delicious. Therefore, it can stand on a par with the perch of Songjiang and the shad of Jiaoshan, and it truly deserves to be the king of fish.</p>

<h3>My Thoughts on Praying for Rain (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>To reduce disasters, one must be "careful with fire." If not, the hired help will only complain and blame heaven and earth, while the masters will only indulge in entertainment and games, paying no attention to anything. In that case, a small spark turning into a prairie fire is unavoidable! Isn't this kind of fire disaster man-made? As for war, there's even less to say. It's mostly for the sake of one person, causing suffering to the people. Even Tang's great drought and his hope for clouds and rain were due to the people's response to Xia Jie's tyranny. How could it be said that heaven bestowed a great responsibility upon him? Speaking of this, I dare to make a definitive statement: the current rain is also due to the unanimous will of the people, and it's definitely not an accident. My maid isn't Zhang Tianshi; she's just repeating old sayings from the old farmers. However, Zhang Tianshi isn't even as good as an old farmer; otherwise, it should have rained on the sixth day of the sixth month, and there should have been eighteen days of processions. The old farmers have experience passed down through generations, so why bother setting up altars and performing rituals? His setting up altars, submitting memorials to heaven, issuing talismans, chanting incantations, performing secret hand gestures, and pacing the Big Dipper is no different from the village heads and elders requesting the government to ban slaughtering animals – it's all for the sake of eating. Everyone is doing it for the sake of eating, and the people's hearts converge, just like the needle of a radio, focused on one station, and naturally receiving the broadcast that everyone in your family wants to hear. This is a very obvious analogy. From this, we can know that with a unified will, anything can be achieved. Then, "human power turning the tide" and "heaven fulfilling human wishes" are certainly possibilities, and it's not superstition, but merely idealism in philosophy. "The human heart is precarious, the moral heart is subtle." When people are in danger, a slight guidance will naturally make them follow the downward flow like water. Therefore, I really want to attribute the credit for praying for rain to the unanimous will of the people, so that any danger can be resolved and reversed with this unanimous will. This power can truly get wind when you want wind, and get rain when you want rain. The methods of governance passed down from Yao to Shun to Yu are based on this single, non-dual principle. It's worth making use of it and shouting the slogan of "human power turning the tide, heaven fulfilling human wishes" to gain the trend of unanimous will. I have always advocated "mental electricity." My analogy is also very simple, like a young man who admires a certain lady in his heart. At first, it's just unrequited love, but when mental electricity starts to have a responsive effect, they often become a married couple. This is a common occurrence. Here's another example: if you want someone walking ahead to turn around, they really will turn around. A child wants to eat something in an adult's hand, but doesn't dare to say it, only thinking about it in their heart, and surprisingly gets some to eat, even though it's expressed on their face, but this expression is still from within. Furthermore, distant travelers long for news from home, and surprisingly receive a letter; people who have been away from home for a long time miss their homes, and surprisingly it manifests in their dreams. If the other party's mental electricity aligns perfectly with yours, it's like a telephone, allowing you to talk heart to heart across thousands of miles. It's just that my personal ideals haven't yet found comrades who are putting in the effort to create their mental electricity. If it's created, it will definitely be like a radio, without needing wires, just tuning into the correct frequency, and you can receive my mental electricity broadcast. I think that one day it will definitely be realized successfully!</p>

<h3>National Sports Association Board Meeting Convened in Beijing This Morning</h3>
<p>All Directors Arriving in Beijing One After Another</p>
<p>Proposals Summarized into Four Items</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd) The National Sports Association is scheduled to hold a board meeting on the morning of the 3rd. All directors are arriving in Beijing one after another to attend. Only Vice Chairman Zhu Jiahua (due to attending the Boxer Indemnity Conference in Qingdao) and Wu Tiecheng (in Shanghai due to official business) are unable to come to Beijing. The proposals are summarized as: (1) Preparation for participation in the 1936 World Olympic Games; (2) Reorganization of the association's affairs; (3) Relocation of the association's headquarters to Beijing; (4) Review and approval of sports terminology. President Wang and Wang Shijie will both attend the meeting and deliver speeches.</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 2nd) The Sports Association is scheduled to hold a board meeting on the 3rd to discuss participation in the World Olympic Games, handling the Far Eastern Games, and the relocation of the Sports Association to Beijing, among other issues. President Wang and Wang Jiaozhang both consider the association to be of great importance to the future of sports education and plan to attend in person. President Wang is also scheduled to host a banquet for all directors on the evening of the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Key Points of Discussion at the Board Meeting</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd) Wang Zhengting arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 2nd. According to his statement to the Central News Agency reporter, he came to attend the National Sports Association board meeting and report on the progress of the 10th Far Eastern Games to the assembly. Key points of discussion at the meeting include: (1) Preparations for participation in the 1936 World Olympic Games; (2) Convening of the next Far Eastern Games; (3) How to promote the popularization of sports throughout the country. In addition, regarding the issue of relocating the association's headquarters to Beijing, Wang stated that whether the headquarters is located in Beijing or Shanghai is acceptable, and the decision should be based on factual convenience. Wang plans to travel north to Qingdao by train on the 4th to attend the board meeting of the Jiaoji Railway after attending the meeting.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Talks About Participating in the World Olympics</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 2nd) Wang Zhengting said that in the previous World Olympic Games, only Liu Changchun participated. For the World Olympic Games to be held in Germany in 1936, the items in which China will participate urgently need to be determined. In general, all parties advocate for a slight expansion. For example, in football, China is a dominant force in the Far Eastern Games, so participation in the World Olympics should be guaranteed. Liu Changchun's short-distance running, etc., will of course continue to be pursued. In addition, Yang Xiuqiong's swimming, having won the Far Eastern championship, can be further developed. Although it may not be possible to have much certainty in the World Olympics, at least it can participate in the competition and have hopes of scoring points. Therefore, the items in which we participate this time should be increased compared to the last time. However, what kinds of items should ultimately be participated in urgently needs to be decided by the board of directors. As for the participation expenses, the amount is relatively large, and how to raise funds also needs to be discussed in detail. Regarding the Far Eastern Games issue, the progress of participation will be reported this time, and the situation of the puppet Manchuria potentially participating will be discussed. If they do, China, for the sake of justice and fairness, must withdraw from the Far Eastern Games. A strict and just policy must be decided today. Furthermore, the board of directors will discuss the method of universally soliciting athletes for the National Games today to comply with the fundamental purpose of promoting sports.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Hosts Representatives of the Pacific Student Conference</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at six o'clock, Mayor Wu hosted leaders of students from along the Pacific Rim and representatives of the conference at a tea party at Wanglu on Haig Road. The men and women representatives to the conference, including Clone, and guests such as Li Denghui, Li Zhaohuan, Pei Fuheng, Zhang Zhuping, Wu Jingxiong, Dong Xian Guang, Li Cai, Bao Wei'er, Lu Ganchen, Zhu Shaoping, Liu Wang Liming, Wang Xiaoying, Yu Hongjun, Li Tingan, Zhang Tingrong, Wu Zixiang, Tang Shixuan, Wang Changchun, Li Dachao and others, more than sixty people, were received by Mayor Wu and his wife, Ms. Ma Fengqi.

Apart from a portion of the student representatives who had already left for Guangzhou for sightseeing, more than ten people who attended Mayor Wu's tea party yesterday are scheduled to go to Beijing today and visit various places in Tianjin and Hebei. The text of Mayor Wu's speech is recorded below. Today, I am extremely pleased to welcome all of you. The purpose of your conference is to enhance mutual understanding and recognition among the various ethnic groups and countries of the world, thereby promoting world peace. Tiecheng expresses deep sympathy for this, because world peace cannot be realized without the understanding of the various ethnic groups in the world. Gentlemen, you have come from afar to our country to attend the conference, and your knowledge and judgment will be accurate, and from now on you will have a thorough understanding of the true psychology and true hope of our people. A philosopher said, "The future destiny of the world is in the hands of the youth of today." I want to say, "World peace is in the hands of the student leaders of today." Since you are in a position of leadership, you will be able to subtly influence the thoughts and ideas of your classmates. It is in this subtle influence that the future of the world and the success or failure of world peace are created, which is truly in your hands. May you take responsibility and strive forward. An ancient sage said, "All within the four seas are brothers." The representatives of your conference come from various countries in the Pacific and can openly discuss without distinction, which is truly worthy of these words. I respectfully welcome all of you with the spirit of the ancient sage that "all within the four seas are brothers."</p>

<h3>Mass Language and Mass Consciousness</h3>
<p>— Wu Shi</p>
<p>It is originally difficult to explain what something is in just a few words. Therefore, after discussing the issue of mass language so much, there are still people like Mr. Feng Zhizhong who ask, "What exactly is mass language?" (See the "Great Beauty Evening News" on July 27.) That's not surprising.</p>
<p>Initially, it was said: "Mass language is the language that represents mass consciousness." It was later revised to say: "Mass language is the language that represents the consciousness of the advancing masses." I put it even more broadly: "Any language that does not represent the special consciousness of a special group is mass language." But some people still don't understand, and they don't understand the word "consciousness." Some overly sensitive friends even say that these two words contain danger, which is truly ridiculous. It seems that it will only be clear with real examples. Now, let's try extracting a few sentences from Mr. Feng's article:</p>
<p>When Cai Jiemin was the president of Peking University, I also happened to be an instructor of dialects at several universities in Beijing, so I know the details. Since Kang Youwei and Zhang Xun became literary and martial sages one after another, many people with the desire to be sages wanted to taste the flavor of being a sage, which is even more than today's movie stars wanting to experience the addiction of being an empress. Since Shi Zhi tried to advocate for the new vernacular and became a vernacular sage, some Peking University professors wanted to be pioneers. Zhang Jingsheng was originally a very honest person, but he transformed himself into a double sage. Zhou Zuoren also opened another pier to be his translation pioneer.</p>
<p>There are personal names here, "Kang Youwei" and "Zhang Xun" are not worth mentioning, but the other four have some importance. "Cai Jiemin" is referred to by his courtesy name instead of his given name, which is usually a sign of respect. "Shi Zhi" is referred to by his courtesy name instead of his surname, which is equivalent to "my friend Hu Shi." "Zhang Jingsheng" and "Zhou Zuoren" are both directly addressed by their given names without any politeness, which clearly shows that they are looked down upon. Thus, the way the names are addressed alone clearly reveals Mr. Feng's consciousness. The equation is as follows:</p>
<p>Respect Cai Jiemin + Pull Shi Zhi as a friend + Look down on Zhang Jingsheng and Zhou Zuoren = Feng Zhizhong's consciousness</p>
<p>We believe that this kind of consciousness is the "consciousness of a special group," because according to "mass consciousness," everyone is a member of the masses. Names should be addressed by the given name, or courtesy names should be addressed by the courtesy name, and there should be no difference in status. So if "My Wife" is translated as "賤内" (my humble wife) or "拙荆" (my clumsy broom), and "My Son" is translated as "豚兒" (my piglet son) or "犬子" (my dog son), the vernacular is still the vernacular, but it is not mass language. Therefore, apart from the difference in consciousness, mass language and vernacular are originally no different.</p>
<h3>Hometown Sound</h3>
<p>— Xun Yu</p>
<p>Yesterday, I made a special trip to meet a friend whom I hadn't seen for exactly twenty years. On the way, I anticipated a lot of pleasure. Meeting a friend from childhood and talking about the naughty things of the past would be a psychological rejuvenation, which would naturally be very gratifying.</p>
<p>However, no one can predict the terribleness of human affairs. As the years pass, not only is physical rejuvenation impossible, but psychological rejuvenation is also impossible.</p>
<p>Of my childhood classmates, nearly one-fifth have passed away, and the remaining eight or nine are trapped in the busyness of life. Tracing the past only increases sadness, so I ended it like this:</p>
<p>--In recent years, I have really wanted to go back once, thinking that meeting some childhood friends would bring a few days of happiness. Looking at it this way, it's all fantasy. It's better not to go back.</p>
<p>The death and困顿 of my friends cannot be entirely attributed to personal incompetence. Most of it is caused by the political environment. Outside, nothing can be known about Guizhou's political situation, except for the news of on-again, off-again wars and not knowing why they are fighting, and how they can reconcile after the war.</p>
<p>--In recent years, what is Guizhou's annual income?</p>
<p>--Around nine million.</p>
<p>--That's barely enough to support it.</p>
<p>--However, eighty or ninety percent of it comes from contraband.</p>
<p>--Of course, there are quite a few people who use it.</p>
<p>--Young people especially. The future destiny of China is in the hands of young people, and they are more enthusiastic about smoking opium than middle-aged people.</p>
<p>Using economic reasons to explain this phenomenon seems inevitable. Middle-aged people are under so much economic pressure that they can hardly breathe; even if they want to smoke opium, they don't have the strength, time, or chance to get involved! A section chief, with a monthly salary of less than a hundred yuan, still has to be in arrears and get a discount. It's already difficult to support daily life, let alone others. Young people are parasites on their fathers and brothers, sucking their blood and sweat without having to sweat and bleed themselves. In Guizhou, where there are no dancing girls to hug or theaters to enter, lying on a bed, exhaling smoke and mist, isn't that the only way out?</p>
<p>This can be regarded as the Guizhou political phenomenon reflected by the petty bourgeoisie and above. If it were reflected from the proletariat, it would naturally have a different flavor.</p>
<p>A villager was arrested three times and taken to the police station for failing to pay a six-yuan levy. It is obviously illegal and against conscience for ordinary people not to comply with the law and pay taxes on time, and they deserve punishment. Paying taxes and obeying the law are the obligations of the people. As for whether they can pay or not, who knows? Moreover, after a little intimidation, ordinary people will end up selling their children and pawning their wives. The police station has long understood the people's hardships, so they resort to the method of pawn and payment. If the pawn cannot be redeemed, they have to release the person, which is an unavoidable reality. If they are released and still don't pay, they have to be pawned again. This is the strictness of the law and also an unavoidable reality. First, if they are released leniently, the public will follow suit, and what will become of the matter; second, the six yuan levy must eventually be settled. Therefore, there is a third pawn and a third release. Villagers cannot do without farming for a day, so being pawned is always hard, and since the levy cannot be paid, a fourth, fifth, and so on, pawn and release will always follow, which makes the villagers have to worry. Poverty breeds wisdom, and the villagers have indeed found a way out - carrying a sharp knife and robbing people on the road.</p>
<p>Heaven never abandons people. Sure enough, a lone traveler came slowly with a package on his back. When the traveler saw the bright knife and the fierce approach, he was so frightened that his soul flew out of his body and had to offer the package with both hands. The villager counted the contents of the bag and was very surprised. There were actually more than ninety yuan, but he was quite content. He left six yuan, didn't take a penny more, and immediately went to the police station to pay the levy, ending a case. Unexpectedly, the robber was still at the gate of the police station, the robbed guest came. The two met, and the traveler pointed out the villager right away. The evidence was right there. Nothing more could be said.</p>
<p>According to the law, robbery is undoubtedly punishable by death. However, the law enforcers are ultimately just people, not King Yama. The cause and effect have long been understood. This has become a very difficult problem. The process must be described in detail and instructions must be requested from the superiors. Unfortunately, the superiors are also just people. There are many things in human affairs that cannot be resolved by human power. What the outcome of this case is, is unknown.</p>
<p>However, the outcome is just the outcome. The facts are enough to know.</p>
<p>If I had literary cultivation, I would definitely be able to write it into a novel or play, hinting that Guizhou's politics have reached the end of the road.</p>
<h3>Life is Like a Whip</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>Life is like a whip,</p>
<p>A whip constantly lashing me!</p>
<p>From the countryside to the city,</p>
<p>From the factory to the mine,</p>
<p>Hunger and cold always mischievously entangle me.</p>
<p>Life is like a whip,</p>
<p>A whip tightly lashing me!</p>
<p>Hardship has devoured my flesh and blood,</p>
<p>Leaving only a few bare bones</p>
<p>Inside my shell.</p>
<p>I, a young lad,</p>
<p>Look like I'm already thirty.</p>
<p>From the countryside to the city,</p>
<p>From the factory to the mine,</p>
<p>Life is always like a whip!</p>
<p>Burning hot, it strikes my body!</p>
<h3>Golden Age</h3>
<h3>On the Sundeck (Sanqu)</h3>
<p>— Pu Feng</p>
<p>Voices of Shanghai, Part One</p>
<p>They say it's the hottest in sixty years. The temperature in the attic room reached ninety-nine degrees, and it's often over ninety at night. During the day, the smell of poisonous gas is felt as soon as you enter the room; in the evening, although the heat has dropped, there is no courage to stay in the steamer, let alone sleep in it.</p>
<p>Oh heavens, who knew the sundeck would be my good dormitory!</p>
<p>Unforgettable, I must water it as soon as the sun sets. Of course, the more you splash, the better. Except for a fool, who would worry that the sundeck will become a swamp? Because of this, I have caused the children in the opposite house to laugh inadvertently several times; the surprise is mixed with a bit of childishness.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I must first circle outside, take a walk, and when I come back, the water on the sundeck is only drying. At that time, the cool breeze keeps blowing, and it gives you a pleasure. And after the chairs are set up, the friends who live together will come to gather, and then, laughter will be broadcast to the outside one after another.</p>
<p>Ten o'clock, ten thirty, the coolness makes us feel sleepy. The canvas bed is immediately laid out; on top, add a thin blanket to block the dew. The clotheslines and bamboo poles used for drying clothes have facilitated me a lot in putting them up.</p>
<p>The friends went into the front building to sleep. My life of dining in the wind and sleeping in the dew began.</p>
<p>Lying down, let the stars smile at me from outside the curtain, blinking their eyes, I keep staring at the Big Dipper, I know they have fallen a little lower than in the evening. As for Venus, I can't see it, it's probably hanging high in the middle!</p>
<p>With great difficulty, I remembered the nursery rhyme I used to sing often when I was a kid.</p>
<p>Seven Auntie Stars, Seven Sisters,</p>
<p>Open the garden door and pick mustard greens:</p>
<p>Pick one skin, leave one skin,</p>
<p>The long one is used for cooking,</p>
<p>The short one is used for marrying Auntie Man.</p>
<p>But when I poked my head out and tried my best to find the Seven Auntie Stars, I was disappointed. Disappointment, disappointment, life has ruined my eyes: I can no longer see the true image of the Seven Auntie Stars without wearing glasses - a little melancholy appeared in my heart!</p>
<p>Naturally, everything from my childhood was quickly remembered, and it seemed that every ordinary thing was very precious. But, after some time, won't today's life become extremely worthy of nostalgic longing? If "life" really has to have waves, if "life" is not mediocre, if people are not slaves to "life," then go, some unnecessary past melancholy!</p>
<p>The turbulent heart suddenly calmed down; then the god of sleep came to flatter me, stealing me into his arms. If it weren't for the moon in the night to wake me up for a moment, I would sleep until morning, when the sunlight made me feel hot, and then I would turn over and climb up!</p>
<p>Leaving the sundeck, naturally, it is to start singing the song of life, singing the song of "life"!</p>
<h3>Moon Lute</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>—Mining Mountain Correspondence No. 4—</p>
<p>Hard work, with endless days, continues. …</p>
<p>People are always so busy and hard. —</p>
<p>The ore carried out of the mine is piled up like a mountain next to the mine. Those who "make grass skins" pick it up one by one, pour it on the grass skin, pick out the "touzi ore" (1) the size of pebbles, grind it with a mill or pestle, and then the "roubizi" washes away the sand and soil mixed in it, and the pure ore is extracted.</p>
<p>The refined ore is mostly carried by horses to Gejiu. Because that is where the "lufang" (2) is located. The big boss (i.e., guotou) (3) often lives there and controls everything. The main equipment in the lufang is a large mill and a large stove that can hold hundreds of pounds of coal. The ore carried down from the factory is then crushed by the mill until it becomes as fine as flour, and then it is placed in a very hot furnace to melt!</p>
<p>The furnace can only melt the ore by sending air into it through a bellows. Therefore, when "pulling the large stove," there are three or four strong people in charge of the bellows, pulling the heavy bellows, and each person can only pull it vigorously twice before quickly handing it over to the person standing next to them, and then pull it vigorously twice - . Because this is very hard.</p>
<p>After being smelted in this way, the tin ore becomes snow-white and dazzling "big tin." Various patterns appear on the surface, some are bamboo leaf patterns, some are peony patterns... The ones with patterns are better and more valuable!</p>
<p>After the big tin is smelted, it can be transported to Hong Kong to sell; but there are also those who sell it to "Guang Bang" (4) in Gejiu, and then the "Guang Bang" transports it to Hong Kong to sell. - In this way, tens of thousands of dollars can be easily obtained by our boss.</p>
<p>Our boss made a fortune, smiling, and on the one hand, remitted the money home to buy land and build a magnificent house, and on the other hand, sent people to the countryside to recruit bankrupt farmers to intensify their work. …</p>
<h3>I Come From the East (13)</h3>
<p>— Hoshino</p>
<p>In this small, mixed-race society, you can see a microcosm of the world, with its class distinctions and racial differences. Compare the Chinese workers in the engine room with the guests in the dance hall, the faces of the British in the accounting office with the Cantonese faces scrubbing the floor, the white-collared Catholic priests in black robes with the bare-chested American girls at the swimming pool, the sour Scots with the extravagant New Yorkers, the slippery Filipino students with the cunning Japanese students, the large-bellied, large-hipped American missionaries with the Guangdong women with hands like dry firewood and faces full of smoke, the barefoot, uncomfortable overseas Chinese children with the wealthy infants in first class, dressed in silk and jade, and you will discover the whole world and all of life on this one ship.</p>
<p>On the ship, I wrote an article, read some new books and magazines, and wrote a few letters. The rest of the time, I spent mostly on deck. In the smoking room, there were several Americans, Japanese, and Swiss who often discussed Far Eastern issues with me. Among the Japanese, there was one named Matsukata Takeshi, who was probably sent by Tokyo to the United States for propaganda and was now returning. He spoke very slickly. On the one hand, he said that Japan's Manchurian policy was wrong, and on the other hand, he said that Tokyo had expressed a friendly attitude towards the United States and other countries. He said flattering things to the United States and perfunctory things to China. Sometimes, I pierced his hypocritical attitude, making him blush red. Other times, he pointed out China's shortcomings, which made it difficult for me to answer. The Swiss, because he worked for a foreign firm in Kobe, desperately helped the Japanese, but the Americans were more clear-headed and laughed at the Japanese's disgusting remarks. After several debates, the Swiss also realized his mistake and humbly asked me about books and magazines on Far Eastern issues, admitting that he had not paid enough attention to important contemporary issues due to lack of time.</p>
<p>(Correction) In Mr. Lu Shaoguang's poem "Hometown" on June 27th, the line "I force me" should be "Again I force me"; on June 30th, in Mr. Xu Xu's poem "In the Fields," "Last year's silkworms' " should be "Last year's silkworms'." We are grateful to Mr. Wang Yu for his letter of inquiry—</p>
<p>We hereby make this correction after investigation.</p>

<h3>Grain Futures Opening Prices and Transactions Set Unprecedented Records</h3>
<p>The Government Should Urgently Impose Sanctions</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market conditions for each month experienced a violent surge unprecedented since the establishment of the exchange. The quoted price of foreign wheat still showed a positive outlook, with Chicago up 7-8 jiao and Canada up 5 jiao. The serious situation of the wheat market soaring by about 2 jiao 3 fen the day before was expected. The confusion in trading was considered unavoidable by those familiar with the situation. Because the market has reached such a bad environment, there is no reason to discuss it, and there is no shepherd of the people to engage in relief, so the madness is like a prairie fire, and it is inevitable that it will be difficult to control. The opening price for this month was immediately raised to 2 yuan 6 jiao, and then fell back by 3 fen. September was still within the 6 jiao range. After October, the equilibrium was at 6 jiao, or as high as 6 jiao 5 fen. The smoothness of trading at that time also set a new record. During the two or three rounds of trading, August, September and October continued to rise, 2-3 fen higher than the initial opening. The following months were still fair. However, the three rounds of trading lasted for more than three hours. Lunch had passed, but the trading was not over, so it had to be temporarily suspended. It was not until 2:30 that the auction was resumed. Unexpectedly, after the opening of the fourth round, the market rebounded again. This month's high was 6 jiao 3 fen 2 li 5 hao, September to 6 jiao 5 fen, October to 6 jiao 8 fen 7 hao 5, November to 7 jiao, December and January to 6 jiao 9 fen. This kind of wild market was a huge 2 jiao difference compared to the closing price in July. The exchange, due to the major changes in the market, feared that danger might occur, and temporarily announced that, starting from the fifth round, all buyer margins would be increased by 500 yuan, and it was planned to take other relief measures when necessary. Because of this, the buying sentiment was slightly eased, and the market gradually loosened, falling 3-4 fen from the highest point, but compared with the end of the previous month, it still soared by about 1 jiao 5 fen. It is found that the market is rising sharply, and the future of people's food is greatly affected. I don't know if the government has also seen it. Today's turnover reached more than 2.7 million bags, which is another new record. As a result, this month rose by 1 jiao 3 fen and a half, September rose by 1 jiao 5 fen 7 li and a half, October rose by 1 jiao 4 fen and a half, November rose by 1 jiao and a half, December rose by 1 jiao 3 fen 2 li and a half, and January opened at 6 jiao and a half, and closed at only 1 fen.</p>

<p>Banks Closed on the 6th, No Trading in Gold</p>

Later, the bank continued to sell nearby US dollars, the domestic market loosened, and people's hearts continued to weaken, making it difficult to maintain gold prices. Major players' selling intentions suddenly became fierce, and quite a few cut their positions, resulting in a downward trend. In addition, a telegram from New Feng Foreign Firm stated that the European situation was unfavorable, so British funds would flow out, and there would be a large number of sellers of British pounds, with the shilling expected to weaken and silver prices expected to rise. People's hearts were attacked, fueling the selling wind. Major players' long positions wavered, and those who were bearish sold their positions, breaking the 80 yuan mark. The subsequent market rose and hovered. Bombay reported an increase of 6, 7, and 8 annas, the domestic market slightly loosened and then fell again. The news of the Central Bank's cash intervention spread, and it rebounded again, rising to over 80 yuan. Bombay also rebounded by a small 2, 3, and 4 annas.

<h3>Securities Rose Slightly in the Morning, but Bonds Continued to Be Highly Pressured by Major Players</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Market did not show firmness in the morning opening, carrying on the fatigue of the previous day. As for the recent period 20 volume, although the 4th day had sales, it was not large, and people's hearts turned firm, competing to buy. Therefore, after entering the market, the 20 customs unified tax and other items rose one after another, soaring by 7-8 jiao, and even the gold short whole six rose by about 1 yuan. Everyone expected that the second round of bonds would tend to be excellent, but who knew that the mad sale of the 35th disbanding soldiers had already given a painful blow to many parties, and the 4th day re-sold 20 volumes and 20 customs, resulting in a slump of thousands of miles, a violent drop of 1 yuan, rising and falling unexpectedly, making it unpredictable. It was rumored that a certain financial authority had a huge amount of long positions coming out, so it could overwhelm everything. According to this trend, the bond market may be difficult to see upward flight for a while, because it has been repeatedly destroyed by major players, making the supply on the table exceed demand. The total number of transactions was 15.62 million yuan. The result of the ups and downs is listed in comparison as shown on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan)</p>

<h3>New York Gold, Silver Stocks in High Demand</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports: Yesterday (the 1st) in the New York stock market, due to the good business report of the United States Steel Corporation, and also because various commercial news was deemed smooth, there was a surge of several corners to four dollars. The market's demand for gold and silver stocks was quite high, as there were rumors that there would soon be news of inflation. The demand for kerosene and utility stocks in the small exchange was continuous, and the market was driven higher as a result. The demand for speculative bonds was quite good, leading to a rise in the bond market. However, U.S. government bonds fell slightly by several corners, while foreign government bonds showed mixed gains and losses. German government bonds plummeted by three dollars. In the Chicago wheat market, there was a large amount of profit-taking, but buying sentiment was strong, and due to poor harvest news and improved export demand, prices still rose. The total trading volume for the day was 780,000 shares. Furthermore, our firm's New York agent reports that (securities), although there was no specific news, the market was quite strong. Traders are now bolder and more aggressive than before. (Grains) The market rose due to the strength in Liverpool and Winnipeg (in Canada), and good performance in corn. Harvest news from Canada and Australia is very poor, and the strength seems likely to occur in Europe, including Liverpool. Prices can be bought when they drop sharply. Tomorrow's private report is expected to favor the bulls. (Cotton) The weather in the western United States is still early, but some believe that current prices have already discounted the various factors favorable to the bulls, so the market is hesitant and uncertain. Current cotton cloth sales are sluggish. Brokers' opinions are not very bullish. Some are now discussing the issue of textile mills reducing working hours and extending shifts. According to Haisin Tuoshi's estimate, the total consumption of American cotton is 13,357,000 bales. Also, the private production estimates released today include three figures: one is 9,233,000 bales, one is 9,321,000 bales, and another is 9,331,700 bales.

<h3>Japanese Merchants' Short Positions in Yarn Remain Unchanged; Sharp Rise in Marked Yarn Price Unlikely</h3>
<p>Actual Sales Very Active: Many Still Bullish</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to be good, but because Japanese merchants' short positions are too large, the rise is not strong. Current yarn sales in the market are increasingly brisk. Purchases from North and South China continue one after another, leading to improved sentiment. Some discussions also suggest that the recent sharp rise in flour and noodle prices will also lead to a bullish outlook for the cotton yarn market.</p>
<h3>"Golden Rooster" Only Gains Two or Three Corners</h3>
<p>The opening of the marked yarn market saw continued strong sales from yesterday's customer base, with purchases from both northern and southern merchants remaining unabated. Furthermore, the current yarn price is trending upward, greatly stimulating sentiment. However, the large number of short positions held by Japanese merchants remain unaddressed, so the rise is not sharp. As a result, each month only rose two or three corners. Total transactions amounted to 35,700 bales. Sales included 700 bales from Mei Kee, 800 bales from Da Feng, 1,000 bales from Xin Chang, 2,000 bales from Hui Kang, 1,450 bales from Geng Feng, 500 bales from Chang Ji, 900 bales from Jun Chang, 500 bales from Shen Ji, 1,300 bales from Da Chang, and 600 bales from Xin Cheng. Purchases included 2,000 bales from Tong Ji, 700 bales from Yu Da, 800 bales from Da Ji, 600 bales from Yuan De, 550 bales from Yuan Yi, 850 bales from Chang Feng, 2,750 bales from Run Kang, 700 bales from Xie Sheng, 500 bales from Xie Sheng, and 450 bales from Ming De.

<h3>Manufacturers Hedge Selling Raw Cotton; Rising Cotton Prices Inevitably Face Setbacks</h3>
<p>The rising trend in the cotton market has stabilized slightly. The situation for American cotton remains stable, so bullish sentiment is quite strong. Most anticipate that American cotton production will be around 9 million bales, so there is still a bullish outlook for future prices. Therefore, those who have absorbed cotton are firmly unwilling to release it. However, according to market sources, a certain factory in Nantong, due to sufficient cotton inventory, is losing money on spinning. It is more profitable to sell raw cotton. Therefore, they are heavily hedging selling in the August futures, with a quite substantial amount of bales.</p>
<h3>Zheng Marked Prices Rise First, Then Fall Back</h3>
<p>The cotton market opened in the morning with a tight atmosphere. American cotton rose again, and those who have absorbed cotton were unwilling to let go, so the trading floor was relatively quiet. However, Da Fu, acting on behalf of a certain factory, was heavily hedging selling every day, so prices fell after the second or third round of trading, but remained high by the close. Bullish sentiment prevails. Recently, the prices of flour and noodles have seen a surprising increase, and American cotton is also stable. The domestic climate is still suffering from severe drought, so it is difficult to be bearish on cotton. However, yarn manufacturers still have no appetite, as yarn prices are still losing money compared to cotton prices, so they are refraining from making purchases. Japanese merchants are also temporarily not entering the market. As a result, prices for each month fell back by 5 corners to 1.5 dollars. Total transactions amounted to 71,100 dan. Sales included 11,600 dan from Da Fu, 1,300 dan from Ji Feng, 1,400 dan from Geng Feng, 2,600 dan from Jun Chang, 1,900 dan from Chang Yu, 1,600 dan from Shen Ji, 1,400 dan from Tai Chang, 3,100 dan from Da Chang, and 3,800 dan from Chang He. Purchases included 1,400 dan from Tong Ji, 3,200 dan from Hui Kang, 7,700 dan from Shen Chang, 4,500 dan from Sen Kang, 1,900 dan from Tong Xing, 3,700 dan from Chang Feng, 4,400 dan from Run Kang, and 4,600 dan from Yong Chang. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<h3>Slight Progress in Cotton Sales</h3>
<p>There has been slight progress in actual cotton sales, as yarn sales have become more active. Sources include 100 bales of Yao cotton. The current selling prices for actual cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>Nan Bao Cotton 50.50 Heng Feng Factory Purchase 125 pieces Spot delivery to factory</p>
<p>Also 52.50 Wei Tong Factory Purchase 85 pieces Again Again</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 45.00 Heng Feng Factory Purchase 500 bales Again Again</p>
<h3>Waiting for the Government's Report on American Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market fluctuated due to waiting for the government report. It strengthened later due to lack of rain in the drought areas and buying on Wall Street. As a result, spot prices rose by 5 points and futures prices rose by 5 to 9 points. British cotton futures rose by 5 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to profit-taking by bulls and selling by Japanese merchants. It then strengthened due to speculative buying by a few, but softened again due to selling by some brokers. As a result, Pingguoer fell by 1.75 rupees, Aomula fell by 3 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (day 1 telegram):</p>

<h3>The "Four Knowledges Hall Style" Art of Scolding People</h3>
<p>— A Long</p>
<p>Scolding people naturally requires art. Scolding people without art is like a village woman scolding in the street, or a street thug scolding at a temple gate, which cannot be considered art.</p>
<p>"Cang na niang," "Diu na ma," this kind of "popular" scolding is definitely non-artistic. The other party, upon hearing it, will surely become enraged, and if handled poorly, it will inevitably lead to the "starting with verbal abuse, followed by physical violence" scenario often seen in local news, ultimately resulting in both parties being judged as hooligans. Wouldn't this ruin the scenery? Therefore, the art of scolding people is indeed indispensable. Roughly speaking, it can be divided into three types:</p>
<p>The first type is to name names, list the crimes, and scold fiercely. Although this method of scolding is "non-artistic," it is still scolding people and still listing the other party's crimes in a seemingly serious manner. Whether the crimes are valid or not is irrelevant, but this method of scolding, like Jiao Da in *Dream of the Red Chamber*, is in the same tone and ultimately offends elegance. This is the most foolish way to scold people.</p>
<p>The second type does not name names but launches a general attack targeting a person's actions or writings. Regardless of whether the actions or writings are right or wrong, I must forcefully argue and scold to my heart's content. Although this type of scolding is somewhat more veiled, because it does not explicitly state the target, bystanders know that it is aimed at a certain matter or writing. This type of scolding is somewhat more artistic, but still not very clever.</p>
<p>The third type of scolding is even more marvelous. The scolding does not specify a particular event or writing, but only mentions one of the person's actions—an action that is not necessarily known to the world—or a sentence from a writing—a sentence that is not widely recited. The scolder only lightly touches upon the inside story with their pen, yet the other party feels shocked and uneasy. This is the most modern way to scold people.</p>
<p>The three types of scolding art each have their own distinct cleverness. However, in the first two types, the identity of the scolder and the matter being scolded must be known to the world. The last type of scolding is truly undetectable. Only the person being scolded knows. To bystanders, it shows no hint of scolding. Even if they know that the scolder is scolding someone, they would not know who is being scolded or what is being scolded. This kind of scolding is only known by heaven, earth, you, and me, like the "Four Knowledges Hall" posted on the door of the Yang family's mansion—that is their art of scolding people.</p>
<p>Scolding people naturally aims to damage reputation and reject personality. The Four Knowledges Hall style of scolding also shares a common psychology with the former two types. However, this style is particularly clever. It does not scold in a way that makes people's hair stand on end and veins bulge but scolds in a way that makes people unable to laugh or cry, unable to speak, and feel distressed and annoyed inside. This is why the "Namo Wen" art of scolding people is so popular in the world.</p>
<p>Why do literary people especially like to scold people? It is said that scolding people is a shortcut to "climbing the dragon," but I have no way of knowing if this is true. However, I have not forgotten a passage I once read, so I will copy it down as my certificate:</p>
<p>Four Knowledges said: "There are no truly famous people in ancient and modern times. But those who can criticize others will gain fame. Mencius criticized Yang and Mo, Zhuang Zhou criticized Confucius, and Han Yu criticized Buddhism. Did they enjoy criticizing people? They did it for fame! Therefore, when Master Shi met great scholars of the time, he would do his utmost to find fault with them. And he would put on a false smile and say, 'His talent is not as good as mine, yet his fame is above mine. Why?' Sometimes they would even receive his great abuse face to face... Therefore, Master Shi lived in the metropolis like an empty hut, walking in the streets and alleys only to encounter chickens, dogs, grass, and trees, unable to meet a single person."</p>
<h3>Hometown in Drought</h3>
<p>— Zhiyuan</p>
<p>The train, dragging a carriage full of unemployed and hungry people fleeing the city, hoarsely roared through the shattered villages of Eastern Zhejiang and slowly, panting, came to a stop at the final station on the banks of the Cao'e River.</p>
<p>The sun's fierce flames continued to bake the ground as they had for the past month. The fields and riverbeds were cracked and split. It should have been the ripening season for the early rice, but the rice, deprived of water, was like a child without milk, short and yellow, like wild grass in the wasteland. The roots of the rice were stuck in the dry, cracked soil, and the tips of the leaves were scorched like they had been burned. The hot summer wind blew them into waves of scorched rice, and in the middle of the scorched waves, a few farmers with sunburnt skin stared at the result of half a year of sweating and bleeding—just a few short, withered blades of grass. The sadness in their hearts made them gnash their teeth and curse, abandoning the water dipper in their hands! Tears mixed with sweat streamed down to their heels.</p>
<p>From Baiguan north to the sandy lands outside the dikes of Lihai, because there are no rivers, it has always been suitable only for growing beans (the yellow soybeans we eat every day). Originally, the soybeans were especially good this year, but more than a month of severe drought has withered the soybeans that were just setting fruit, leaving only dry, bitter bean stalks. This outcome will plunge the dry-farming peasants of forty or fifty villages along the dike, under the special system of prepayment of land rent every other year, into an unimaginable famine panic.</p>
<p>The rice is mostly hopeless, but the farmers are still fighting desperately. Together with their young children and wives, they use two or three old-fashioned waterwheels to transfer water from the distant Sha River, bucket by bucket, to the fields. The pitifully thin children cannot withstand the hard labor and the baking sun. Touching the blisters on their small hands and soles, they fearfully wipe away the tears in their eyes and continue working in despair. As long as there is water anywhere, they will go to wheel and bail day and night, regardless of their lives, until not a drop remains! The cracked soil cannot absorb enough water. The water dries as soon as it flows over it, so the water never reaches the entire field.</p>
<p>Between the scorched waves of rice and the withered bean stalks, the straight highway stretches like a fiery snake, and the flat airfield is as wide as the sky. Tens of thousands of coolies are sweating as they open up the land, carry stones, and drag the flattening machine. Iron hammers strike iron chisels in the crevices of the mountain rocks, and the foul sweat drips onto the yellow sand. Beneath the iron sparks and the fiery sun, miserable cries of "Hang yo, hang yo" continue.</p>
<p>Not a drop of water is left. The hardworking farmers of fifty or sixty villages rely solely on the green, stinking water in a few small ponds to survive. The blood and sweat of the cows and horses are nothing to the clean "heavenly water" (water collected in jars when it rains) in the landlords' grand mansions. The farmers of more than ten villages near Songxia cannot find water to boil tea or cook rice. On the fifteenth day, more than ten thousand farmers flocked to the dikes of Shenjia Ferry and Tangwan, and under the sound of farmers' gongs and voices, the great embankment was immediately cut off. Although the seawater is as salty as salt water, they are too thirsty to care. Although noble gentlemen used beautiful words such as "harmful to farmland" to prevent the waterless farmers from opening the dikes, they fled and hid in the face of the power of the masses.</p>
<p>The living standards of the farmers are so bitter that it is unimaginable. In the morning, they eat a meal of corn flour paste. At noon, when they return from the stone roads, which are like hot irons, carrying loads of more than a hundred catties, they fill their stomachs with wheat bran rice, which is made by crushing wheat and mixing it with a little rice. The coarse wheat grains make it difficult for them to swallow. In the evening, they have another meal of corn paste or thin porridge. In the current year, swept by floods, good harvests, and droughts, even this food that is only fit for pigs is being taken away. Hundreds of millions of hardworking farmers across China must be ashamed and envious of the urban pampered dogs eating beef!</p>
<p>Accompanied by the increasing hunger and oppression, their strength to fight is also growing. Although the government allows them the right to reduce rent by 25%, they never see the government implement it. Now they have risen up to enforce it themselves and demand the abolition of the cruel system of prepayment of land rent and demand the reduction and abolition of rent in times of drought and famine (due to the different severity of the disaster in different regions).</p>
<p>In the flames of drought and famine, in the whirlwind of death and starvation, the farmers' future oscillates between two possibilities.</p>

<h3>The Art of "Endurance"</h3>
<p>— Hua Ying</p>
<p>If someone punches you, you should at least return a punch. If someone kicks you, you should at least return a kick. That's "fair trade," with neither side suffering a loss. Conversely, if someone punches you or kicks you, you just endure it, as if the punch wasn't hitting you and the kick wasn't aimed at you. Then, people will treat you like an idiot, taking advantage of you everywhere. You think that there's a knife above the word "endurance," so just endure it for a while, and you won't suffer a loss. But you don't realize that the more you endure, the more you lose. People will think you're useless, not knowing that you're deliberately enduring. As a result, you retreat an inch, and they advance a foot. If you had just turned around and given them a good "lesson," asking if they dared to mess with you again, they would have fled with their heads in their hands. People are most afraid of the strong, and this is a good example.</p>
<p>However, while simply enduring doesn't work, it's not without its advantages. In short, adjusting your sails to the wind is one of the best methods. For example, if someone is weaker than you and they act arrogant in front of you, you must not endure it. Not only should you repay them with the original punch plus interest, but you should also ensure that they don't dare to show such arrogance in front of you again. If you unfortunately encounter someone stronger than you, you must retreat strategically, considering endurance as the best option, without the slightest negligence. You also need to tell these weaker people, "I will definitely fight him fair and square!" This is what is meant by saying things beautifully, while keeping the shame hidden in your heart.</p>
<p>Therefore, endurance is an extremely painful thing, but when you are unable to retaliate, you must understand this art of endurance. This way, you can at least calm your anger and hide your red face.</p>
<h3>Night Heart</h3>
<p>— Ms. Jiong</p>
<p>The weather today is like returning to the rainy season—so gloomy, with a chilling drizzle followed by alternating periods of cloud and sunshine. The sun is deeply hidden in the clusters of dark clouds, and the verdant leaves are waving in the wind on the branches. The surrounding scenery, however, is like a ghostly realm in the haze, making people shudder!</p>
<p>When night came, there was no moonlight. The gloom was desolate, and even a few sparse stars were blown away by a gust of wind and hidden in the clouds. Only the dim streetlights, like ghostly fires, squinted at me. Alone, I dragged my weary steps, slowly walking along the road, finally arriving at my doorstep as a gust of wind swept up from the ground to my feet.</p>
<p>Returning home on a dark night should have been a comforting thing! Yet, this time, it was completely different from what I had imagined. Only because I had been running around outside all day for work, constantly hitting walls, did I feel an extreme sadness and unease. The sorrow of graduating and being unemployed gnawed at my heart like silkworms eating leaves. The light in the house, shining on the untidy furniture and the cluttered books on the table, revealed a desolate picture. This scene was also deeply reflected in my heart.</p>
<p>An anxious heart felt as if it were weighed down by a large stone, tossing and turning in the heart. Could it be that graduating really means being unemployed?!</p>
<p>The night wind outside was stirring, making a whooshing sound, and an indescribable anxiety and disturbance, accompanied by the roar of the wind, intensified to the point of seeming to be about to burst uncontrollably! It seemed as if everything was collapsing!</p>
<p>With a body exhausted from a day of overwork, I finally managed to lie down on the bed, planning the course of future struggles, wanting to rest first. Who knew that cruel "reality," like a hammer, relentlessly struck my heart, causing it to groan sleeplessly in the night!</p>
<p>A lonely lamplight accompanied my solitary heart. Looking out the window at the massive dark object, attached to the howling wind, my heart could not help but tremble!</p>
<p>Ah, my heart! In this deep night, lonely, dim, like the rainy season weather, gloomy and desolate!</p>
<h3>Lychee Season</h3>
<p>— Ren Ying</p>
<p>Seeing the bright red lychees in the market, it reminds me that it's lychee season in the South Seas again.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I loved to eat fruit. My childhood in the South Seas made me love eating lychees even more. Lychees floating in ice water are bright red. Once you peel off the spiky shell, the glistening white flesh makes my mouth water. Adults warned us that lychees had to sink to the bottom of the water for a long time before we could eat them; otherwise, our noses would bleed. Eating too many would also cause the same problem. The greedy desires of a child often made me angry.</p>
<p>During lychee season, we looked forward to my younger brother's nanny every day; she would bring many lychees. The outline of this woman still seems to be in my mind. A chubby face, sturdy legs. Wearing three hairpins, with shoes adorned with red silk tassels. In the summer, she often wore a bright red bodice. This crude appearance of bare calves, if seen by the people of Shanghai, would surely make them recognize her as a character from the "Wild History of Yao Mountain."</p>
<p>The lychees she brought were quite large, fragrant, and sweet, and the pit was so small.</p>
<p>One year, there was fighting between warlord territories; and barbed wire was spread across the streets of the South Seas. We took refuge in the Xiangtai Timber Company, with the British flag flying from the roof; this would avoid the disaster of defeated soldiers.</p>
<p>Playing tennis on the grassy field, or chasing each other in the quiet bamboo forest. This time of life was beautiful. Adults worried that the area would be ravaged, but the hearts of the children remained peaceful. And we could eat as much as we wanted, these large lychees one by one.</p>
<p>I left the South Seas that year and went to study at a church school in Shanghai. Every summer vacation, I had to go back. But I no longer had the same feeling of eating lychees as when I was a child! The lychee season was the time to leave the South Seas. The heart of a child would be shrouded in the sadness of parting.</p>
<p>Now everyone in my family has moved back to my hometown. When will I go back to find the traces of my childhood?</p>
<p>It's lychee season again, and the dream of prosperity has been shattered. I have to extend my coarse arms and grab bread. I think of my hardworking father and my wife spending the summer in the South Seas; I hope they bring me some news from the South Seas.</p>

<h3>Fickle Woman</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Wang married a woman named Yi last year through a matchmaker, according to the orders of his mother (the matchmaker was the woman's older sister). After marriage, their relationship was fairly harmonious, and she is already pregnant. However, Yi has not received any education, and her father is unemployed. She has an older sister who is a singer in an entertainment venue and married to a gangster, so her behavior is vulgar. This year, Mr. Wang and his cousin opened a factory together at Mr. Wang's house, so his cousin sees Yi often. Seeing that the woman is fickle, she soon transferred her love from Mr. Wang to his cousin. Mr. Wang has heard rumors, but has no evidence and can do nothing, so there are frequent disputes in the family. Recently, Yi has become even more extreme, saying that Mr. Wang and his mother are mistreating her, and inciting her sister to gather many gangsters to come and make a scene, uttering various threatening words (such as, "If you don't take out money to settle this, we will kill you"). Mr. Wang is an honest businessman, and has also received an education, so he and his mother are constantly lamenting. Now he is thinking of seeking legal help, but does not know where to start. I have several questions and humbly ask you to answer them one by one. I would be extremely grateful. (1) Can he sue for divorce in court? (2) Does Mr. Wang have to pay alimony to Yi? (3) Can he sue her sister or brother-in-law for adultery (her brother-in-law is a gangster; if he is convicted by the court, will Mr. Wang be harmed)? Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dao An, He Yijun</p>
<p>Answer: I will now answer your three questions separately: (1) Mr. Wang's wife has gathered gangsters and threatened to kill her husband, which meets the condition of "intent to kill the other party" for filing for divorce under the Civil Code. According to the Civil Code, intent to kill can be established as long as there is an intention to harm, without the need for concrete evidence. If there is concrete evidence, it is not just a divorce, but also a criminal responsibility.</p>
<p>(2) According to the current Civil Code, the provision for damages in a divorce judgment requires the fault of the other party, and only the victim can demand it. As for alimony, although it does not adopt the principle of fault-based debt payment, that is, even if one party is not at fault, if the other party's life becomes difficult after the divorce, reasonable alimony should be paid. However, "the other party" must also be "without fault." If the divorce of the other party is self-inflicted, then you can ignore it.</p>
<p>(3) If the evidence is solid, of course you can. As for whether her brother-in-law will be unfavorable to Mr. Wang in the future, it is difficult to say. But simply "fearing" and "tolerating" is not the solution. So, in my opinion, Mr. Wang should act legally, and should accuse him if he should be accused. At the same time, take careful precautions, and if he has a conspiracy to harm him, immediately call the police and have him dealt with by the law.</p>

<h3>One Night (II)</h3>
<p>— Li Huaiying</p>
<p>So Mrs. Liu, a middle-aged woman with bound feet from Leting, Mrs. Ning from Mian'an, and Mrs. Sun from Wangqing, who had only slept with her husband for one night and then separated, put down their worries, and each said in turn:</p>
<p>"This is truly calling for poor fun."</p>
<p>"We're about to die, and we still don't know how to worry."</p>
<p>"This is something that can't be helped."</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng didn't finish her steamed bun, only ate three bites, and threw it out the window with a wave of her hand, saying loudly:</p>
<p>"The people who wrap the buns are also annoying, they always put some dirt in the buns, these stupid things."</p>
<p>She ate sand in the bun again. Just then, the children playing outside shouted:</p>
<p>"Who threw the bun?"</p>
<p>"Where did the bun come from? Who threw it?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng shrank her tongue, and the five women looked at each other in silence, like thieves caught in the hands of the police. Because on ordinary days, when teaching their children, they strictly forbade them from wasting food.</p>
<p>After a while, the children's complaints stopped, and the room was filled with the smell of cigarettes, swirling and rippling. Suddenly, Mrs. Ning spoke again:</p>
<p>"There's no news from Xinjiang either, what should we do?"</p>
<p>A long time ago, they were looking forward to news from Xinjiang, but there had been no news from Xinjiang for four or five months. They heard that there was a war going on there, and air traffic was not open, so the letters could not be mailed. They were anxious.</p>
<p>"Stop dreaming, even if there is news from Xinjiang, and they let you go, can you really go? What are you going to use to go? Can you grow wings and fly there, or can you somersault 108,000 miles like the Monkey King? We're about to starve, we don't even have money to live on, what's the use of thinking about news from Xinjiang! Isn't that daydreaming!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Liu, who had been sitting silently on the side for a long time, using her full Guanli accent, said loudly.</p>
<p>"We don't even know if these people are still alive, didn't they say the war there is very fierce," Mrs. Sun continued, "Why is our fate so bad? Escaping from the hands of the Japanese, only to let them die in Xinjiang, whose past life didn't cultivate well, committed sins, and suffered such retribution!"</p>
<p>She used to study in a private school, and was one of the few people who knew how to read the most. Every day when she had nothing to do, she would sing songbooks and folk tunes, seeming to be more relaxed than others. She was originally speaking angrily, but Mrs. Zheng came to tease her. Crying and saying:</p>
<p>"Yes, the heavens don't open their eyes, people only slept with their loved ones for one night, and the heavens are making trouble."</p>
<p>Causing another burst of laughter.</p>

<h3>Re-discussing Dialect and Vernacular Films (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Danfeng</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Tang Na</p>
<p>In recent days, a heated debate about "mass language" has been sparked in the film industry, which is indeed a good phenomenon. Mr. Tang Na insists on building his "mass language" from the highly developed dialects and vernaculars with great enthusiasm. Although we cannot agree with his opinion, it is still a good phenomenon to have a heated debate to thoroughly resolve the issue.</p>
<p>From his article "Re-discussing Cantonese Sound Films," we can know that the source of his argument is based on Mr. Gao Huang's statement: "Mass language must not be a unitary national language-style thing, but rather a pluralistic development targeting the masses of each locality." Regarding this statement, I think there is a grammatical error, or at least Mr. Tang Na misinterpreted its original meaning. We believe that "pluralistic development" is to adopt progressive vocabulary necessary in the mass production process from various dialects and vernaculars; that is, to integrate individual progressive vocabularies into a unified Mandarin, which becomes a mass language understood and used by the general public, and not a pluralistic division, making the dialects and vernaculars of various places develop independently as a whole, forming a phenomenon of linguistic fragmentation in a nation. Mr. Tang Na's understanding of "pluralistic development" actually becomes "pluralistic division."</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Tang Na equates the development of the languages and cultures of various ethnic groups with the development of local dialects and vernaculars, which is, in any case, an error in understanding. We must know that the inherent languages and cultures of various ethnic groups, in terms of traditional relations, have completely different points from those of other ethnic groups, from the structure of writing to the composition of language. Therefore, we must never replace the culture of the conquered ethnic group with the language and culture of the conqueror, so as to eliminate its inherent culture, just like Japan forcibly made people learn Japanese in the Northeast and implemented cultural aggression. On the contrary, we must allow the languages and cultures of various ethnic groups to develop freely and independently. The language and culture within the Han nationality, in terms of the writing itself and the structure of the language, are completely unified, only with differences in pronunciation, so this is completely different from the differences between ethnic groups. Then why shouldn't we unify it but instead divide it?</p>
<p>That's right, what Mr. Tang Na said may be the view of unifying from division, thinking that since it is already divided, it is okay to highly develop its dialects and vernaculars, and then mutually dissolve them into a mass language. But he only saw the side of division, and did not see the side of gradual unification. This requires a more detailed explanation.</p>
<p>Since the economic invasion of imperialism into Chinese rural areas, dialects and vernaculars have begun to shake. Until the countryside was swept by the economy of imperialism and rural areas went bankrupt, a large number of farmers flowed into the cities. The local dialects they brought were not practical enough, so a common language was produced in the production process. What they said was not purely local dialects, but a Mandarin that everyone could understand. The existence of this Mandarin should be undeniable by anyone, then this is the foundation of the mass language, and then fully adopt the active "vocabulary" in the local dialects to enrich its content. On the contrary, we must never support the development of individual dialects and vernaculars, making them languages that are not mutually understood. Does it mean that workers from various places gathered in a factory should all speak their local dialects? (To be continued)</p>

<p>Up To The Neck - Showing at Grand Shanghai</p>
<p>"Lucky Actor" is a British film, a British film below the horizontal line.</p>
<p>The title has already told us about the content of this film, how an actor got his "lucky fortune."</p>
<p>Such an old and ordinary story, coupled with the director's poor handling, we cannot but admit that it is a complete failure.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to use actors as film material, and it is even more common to describe how an actor goes from being down and out to becoming famous. However, the screenwriter of "Lucky Actor" clings to this clichéd and empty subject matter, which shows how superficial and naive the screenwriter is.</p>
<p>In the real society, there are many facts worth exposing, but they have no understanding of reality, no understanding of reality, no contact with reality.</p>
<p>They just look for themes in clichés, and their subjective fantasy is that a down-and-out actor will suddenly get a inheritance of 150,000 pounds, will get a fairy-like beauty, will become famous in one fell swoop,….</p>
<p>Ordinary, cliché, fantasy, … this is all of "Lucky Actor."</p>
<p>In "Lucky Actor," there are traces of affectation everywhere, and the director's chaotic and fragmented techniques, as well as the lack of coherence in the emotions before and after, are difficult to point out one by one.</p>
<p>The actors are also mediocre.</p>
<h3>Review of "Wrongful Imprisonment"</h3>
<p>— Danfeng</p>
<p>Shadows of Sing Sing</p>
<p>- Da Guangming -</p>
<p>It has become common knowledge that there are few good films to watch in the summer. And this "Wrongful Imprisonment," Da Guangming only wanted to show it for two days as a transitional film, and its value can be imagined.</p>
<p>It is also well known that Columbia Pictures rarely has good works. Not long ago, although there was a "Grand Dame," which was praised by soft gentlemen as the supreme treasure, the dreamy content determined the fate of the work, and formalism could not save it. In addition, we have also seen a few more valuable films, but there are very few. And this "Wrongful Imprisonment" can simply be said to be a completely failed work.</p>
<p>The main thing is that the screenwriter completely fails to explore the reality of society, so that the characters in the play become frivolous characters without social basis. And this film appears as a detective film, but in the course of the play, in addition to those stiff and far-fetched suspicious formations and foreshadowing arrangements, other more desirable screenwriting skills cannot be seen here.</p>
<p>In this story, all we can see is the praise of American law and the existing system, as well as the competence and vigilance of the police or the scientific management of prisons. Apart from this, we have no way to obtain what we need to know. As for the arbitrary concept that evil people should be punished, it shows the screenwriter's vulgarity and incompetence. However, if someone wants to find some new explanation from the love affair between the son of the police detective chief and the sister of the bandit, it is obviously superfluous and unnecessary work. Regarding this aspect, all that is coincidence and inconsistency. The only relatively real thing is the detective chief's prohibition of his son's love with the bandit's sister.</p>
<p>Phil Rosen should be the third-rate director in the United States, right? Although we don't know him too well, judging from this work, we can generally prove that he is a vulgar and incompetent person. From the first shot to the last shot, we only see the actors floating in a dull atmosphere. Even including the love description of Dou Bai and Wei Qi, the director has no way to grasp the audience's emotions, and we viewers can only breathe that stuffy air with extreme annoyance.</p>
<p>As for the director's lack of in-depth description of the characters' personalities, coupled with the actors' unfamiliar acting skills, they are all helping to bury this film in the deep pit of failure.</p>
<p>One scene in "Bees Drunk and Butterflies Infatuated" - The yellow-faced wife on the bedside is gone to the clouds - Showing in Nanjing</p>
<h3>The Crossroads of Wine and Lust in "Bees Drunk and Butterflies Infatuated"</h3>
<p>Atlantic City is a place in the United States where people are infatuated with paper and gold. In there, romances are constantly happening, and large gatherings of large enterprises are often held here. Therefore, Americans have a saying, "Perhaps we have met in Atlantic City," which is equivalent to what we say, "Looks familiar." But between the tones, there is a bit of frivolous meaning, especially when it is used for the opposite sex? Atlantic City is nicknamed "Conference City", probably based on this fact.</p>
<p>The Herne Goodyear Rubber Company held a conference, and crowds of people poured out of the special train in Luju. Among them, ten big stars of Warner are shining. They, or she, are occasionally chained by fate, driven by ambition, unintentionally leisurely, and purposefully pursuing. In short, in this romance, the important figures include male and female high-level experts, old husbands who are afraid of their wives but also like to fish for beauty, jealous old wives, wine sages who travel the world for dregs, young and nosy fellows, and a wonderful woman who specializes in seduction, gold mining, and bloodsucking. The object of her life is gold.</p>
<p>In such good times and beautiful scenery, of course, it has aroused a lot of pride and elegance.</p>
<p>What is hateful is that heaven and earth are unkind, taking all things as straw dogs. Wherever human traces reach, they are always filled with traps of deceit, attacking from the side and front, changing endlessly. Looking at the entire play of "Bees Drunk and Butterflies Infatuated", entering the master and exiting the slave, deceiving each other, it is difficult to describe with pen and ink. The butterflies wearing flowers are blurry and elusive, and cannot be captured. The so-called crossroads of wine and lust, everyone knows. As for the talents and skills of Qiong Bailangdai, Er Yadaofu Meng Yu, etc., there is indeed no need to introduce them.</p>

<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Good Son and Good Wife (Born to be Kissed) (V)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Yi Di is a woman with a spirit of never giving up. Although she was dismissed by Pan Qi, she was not discouraged by it. Instead, she took out part of the money Pan Qi gave her, bought train tickets, and went to Palm Beach with Ji Di. Pan Qi didn't tell her that he was going to Palm Beach, but she found out from elsewhere. Ji Di was reluctant to be Yi Di's companion this time, because she felt that Yi Di was pursuing millionaires, but lost many good opportunities. In Ji Di's eyes, a beautiful doorman, a uniformed chauffeur, and a curly-haired elevator operator were more practical than Yi Di's daydreaming millionaires. But Yi Di was very determined and refused to give up her claim. They wanted to go to Palm Beach together to find Pan Qi, where did they have the effort to spend on others?</p>
<p>They actually arrived at Palm Beach. In the Palm Beach branch of Pan Qi's company, they went to look for Pan Qi, but Pan Qi's private secretary, Miss Niu Bailan, who Yi Di thought was an ignorant old cat, told her that Pan Qi had not come. Yi Di was half-believing and wanted to retreat. She was figuring out how to proceed, when suddenly a young man came over. She asked Yi Di excitedly, "Good morning. Is there anything I can help you with?" Yi Di said to him in a grandiose manner, "I'm waiting to see Mr. Pan Qi." The young man said, "Oh, I am Mr. Pan Qi." Yi Di glanced at him and said angrily, "Oh, you are? Okay, then I am Mrs. Vanderbilt." She also pointed to Ji Di and said, "This is Mrs. Astor." Both are famous figures. The young man smiled and bowed and said, "Pan Qi is out of luck today. Maybe he won't come today." Yi Di listened, looked at Ji Di, and then said, "Then let's go to his house." She stood up and walked towards the door, but the young man blocked their way again and said, "He is not at home either... How about I treat you to lunch?" Yi Di resolutely said, "No need, thank you." She didn't care about anything and pulled Ji Di out.</p>
<p>There is a very fashionable mode of transportation in Palm Beach, which is a pedal bicycle chair pushed by manpower. The two of them took that kind of chair to Pan Qi's office. Now the two of them jumped on the waiting bicycle chair again, but they didn't know that at this time the young man had already given a banknote to the driver and pushed it himself. At this time, Ji Di said angrily to Yi Di, "Why don't we relax and play here for a day?" Yi Di said, "That's because we want to be noble ladies?" Ji Di said, "Just now the young clerk invited us to dinner, can't we be noble ladies if we eat with him?" Yi Di said, "Alas, you don't understand. A woman meets a young and beautiful man, like the clerk just now, it is easy to be infatuated - but the result is probably only living in a small flat in Newark, and probably have to wash pants for children later." While they were talking, they suddenly heard giggling behind them. The car suddenly left the road, jumped onto the grass, and crashed straight into a palm tree. The car body also overturned immediately, throwing the two of them on the grass. Yi Di got up and ran straight to the driver, scolding, "Do you know what you are..." But she immediately stopped, her eyes staring at the fake driver. (To be continued)</p>
