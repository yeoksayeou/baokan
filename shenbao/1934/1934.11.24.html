<h3 id="c31">印度自治之前途 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>號稱世界文明古國之印度。為英人所覊縻者。已三百有餘年。即言其直轄於英倫政府之歷史。亦幾八十載矣。英人之視印度。固無殊於禁臠。而以年來自主運動之激昂。乃不惜虚與委蛇。由高壓政策漸變而為懷柔政策。然其欲永久把持之心理。則未嘗稍異也。</p>
<p>印度民衆之所要求者。厥為獨立與自主。最低限度亦為一自治殖民地應享之權利。然英人則祗願討論印度現行憲法之改訂。在形式上以聯邦制度替代中央集權。他非所問。一九三零年來。英人為憲法問題而召開圓桌會議者。先後三次。其目的無非欲假借「自治」之美名。以期打銷一九一九年間印度國民大會在拉賀爾所通過主張「完全獨立」之議案耳。</p>
<p>第三次圓桌會議後。英政府曾發表白皮書。述及改訂印度憲法之提議。其要點則謂。印度聯邦之執行權。操諸總督之手。總督得節制並管理國防外交與宗教各部事務。而立法會則不得通過使英人或英公司在行使某種特許權利時受任何限制或歧視之法律。英政府之真面目。至是更暴露無遺。宜乎反響四起而有修改之議也。今觀乎最近公布之印度憲法改革報告書。總督之權力仍極廣泛。而英人在印之特殊地位。又有明文之保障。如此規定。不惟去完全自主之事實絶遠。即欲與加拿大等自治殖民地相平等。亦屬夢想。印人譁然反抗。固在意中也。</p>
<p>然吾人默察印度内情。則又不得不覺印人本身亦有其應尸之咎。蓋獨立運動。所以求政治之自由及民族之解放。而政治的民主精神則必以社會的民主精神為基礎。奈何印度宗教與民族衝突之激烈。階級觀念之深刻。皆為舉世所罕有。英人安得不利用此種弱點居間操縱。使三萬萬印人永無超脱之日耶。即如印度國民大會本為全體印人圖謀獨立之利器也。而全印民族中勢力最厚之印度教與回教徒。同牀異夢。始終堅持成見。不肯和衷共濟。遂使負重大使命之國民大會無從發揮其應有之威力。如許年來。雖經國内重要領袖如甘地。及内都夫人等之奔走調停。反覆勸導。而成效絶微。良可慨也。</p>
<p>今姑退一步言。謂此新近發表之憲法綱要。已極盡公正寛大之能事。而印回二教之傾軋。仍將使全案關鍵之議員選舉問題。毫無圓滿解决之望。蓋觀於過去之經騐。一言選舉。印回二教之主張。便將立見衝突。其故則以印度教徒之人數。二萬四千餘萬。佔全人口約四分之三。回教人數六千八百餘萬。佔全人口約五分之一。印度教自恃人多。素主議員之産生。應由「合選制」選岀。即合各族選民於一處。以得票最多數者當選。而回教則主張「分選制」。即各民族分選若干席議員。組織議會。（但在孟加爾與本加布二省。本教人數獨多。則亦主張合選。）此外又要求在立法機關中之任何提案。須得回教全體代表三分之二同意。方許通過施行。不然完全無效。雙方各執一是。堅持不讓。今聞憲政報告書中關於聯邦與各省之議會。皆規定各少數民族之議席。而事實上能否順利支配。仍為絶大疑問。此而不决。任何憲政改革。固無從談起也。英人而有扶助印度自治之誠意者。曷勿一加之意乎。</p>
<p>去今約一月前。全印大會開會於孟買。主席在致開會詞中痛詆英國白皮書政策。結語則云。「吾人赤手空拳。以道德之武器。與備有最新式破壞機械之政府相奮鬥。以争公道。上帝必佑助吾人。」其言絶為沈痛。然印人望上帝之佑助。而吾人則尤望印人之能自助也。</p>

<p>［日内瓦］南斯拉夫政府為馬賽暗殺案政治責任問題、向國聯會提岀之申請書、業由該國外長葉夫的區提交國聯會秘書廳、申請書略謂馬賽暗殺案關係重大、足以擾亂南國與匈牙利之邦交、因有若干恐怖主義份子託庇匈牙利、而得某某官廳之援助、申請書旋謂南國為恐怖主義黨徒之活動、曾與匈牙利直接談判、並於本年七月在南國京城成立妥恊、匈牙利允許予以禁止、乃據最近調查、恐怖主義黨徒依然受匈牙利之庇護、故王亞　山大與法外長巴爾都之遇害、即係此輩所為、而事先佈置亦係在匈牙利境内行之、又查此次馬賽案兇手之各從犯中、有若干人係從前曾經犯案、經南斯拉夫向匈牙利提岀控訴者、據其供詞、可見渠等不獨受匈國之庇護、並係成羣居住於匈國境内、直與馬賽案發生之前夕為止、南斯拉夫並擬提岀若干文件、以為申請書所列各事件之證明、南國政府要求將此案列入國聯會議程、以便於下届行政院開會時論論之、（按本年五月中旬、匈牙利政府為匈南邊境上發生之事件、曾向國聯會提岀申請書、南國繼亦提岀備忘錄後、行政院擬討論此事、而南匈兩國忽有直接談判之意、以是作罷、本電所稱七月間在南國京城成立之妥恊、大約即係兩國直接談判之結果）（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅捷致文國聯</p>
<p>為南國作聲援</p>
<p>［日内瓦］南國政府將關於馬賽暗殺案政治責任之申請書、提交國聯會以後、捷克與羅馬尼亞政府亦分别以公文致送國聯會、其内容相同、略謂兩國政府以為馬賽案之政治責任、足以擾亂各該國與匈牙利之邦交、故兩國政府對南國向國聯會所提之申請書、表示同情云云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>顯具政治作用</p>
<p>匈牙利表抗議</p>
<p>布達佩斯　匈牙利總理貢博斯向半官通訊社發表聲明書、對於南斯拉夫政府之行動、作嚴重之抗議、並將本國政府對此問題之見解詳細闡明、而謂此種行為實有碍歐洲之和平云、匈總理聲稱、匈牙利政府對於此項馬賽事件之文書並不驚異、不過視此僅係一種報紙宣傳之進一步行動、此項宣傳數月來已司空見慣、其目的無非欲毁損匈牙利之地位、惟此項文書之論調、與報上所載者如岀一轍、為可異耳、匈牙利政府將請世人注意南斯拉夫文書之政治作用、匈牙利立國以來幾及千載、其歷史從未優容此類政治暗殺之手段、是故以匈牙利代表之資格、對南斯拉夫之文書提岀嚴重抗議、並否認一切羅織之辭云、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>國聯匈牙利代表愛楷脱對此挑戰、立即應付、聲稱彼甚願得有機會、可在國聯行政院辯論馬賽事件、愛氏並稱、「予絶端反對此種策略、予以為此實無異於國際恐佈主義」云、所謂策略蓋即指南國之控告而言、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>日内瓦大震驚</p>
<p>法國左右為難</p>
<p>［日内瓦］據政治觀察者稱、南斯拉夫致國聯之申請書、對於匈牙利指摘甚力、此間各界頗為震動、法國及小恊約國方面亦覺左右為難、蓋以數日前法外長賴伐爾曾與小恊約代表磋商至再、殊不料其結果如是也、各方推測南斯拉夫行將提岀各項確實證據以充實其申請書、又據南斯拉夫方面宣稱、此項文據不久即將公諸世人、以證其非誣告、至該申請書雖僅對匈牙利而言、然在各方觀察之下、其中更將引起南斯拉夫與意大利之糾紛、是則意法與小恊約國近頃之妥恊運動、不免受打擊也、特南國之申請書在明年一月前、不致在國聯會行政院提岀討論耳、（二十三日國民電）</p>

<p>許日本漸進的平等</p>
<p>西門認為較有希望</p>
<p>英美會商對日行動</p>
<p>［倫敦］英外相西門今日在下院發言、完全否認英美日三國海軍談話業已决製之説、此蓋言今尚有三途可打破僵局也、</p>
<p>（一）以一種方式許日本分若干年達於平等地位的理想之回復、</p>
<p>（二）最後達「四·四·四·」之平等度、則英美海軍須事裁减、</p>
<p>（三）日本接受僅作質的限制之討論、</p>
<p>第一途似最有希望、蓋現有理由可信日本或顯助同覓求此種方策也、第二途大約不為英美兩國所喜、第三途亦難實現、因拒絶討論不作量的限制而僅作質的限制、乃日本方案中根本要點之一也、聞外間所傳日本已正式承認英國得置較日更大的艦隊隊權、但不承認美國有此權一節、實屬不確、日本曾要求共同更高的限度而施諸各國、英國自亦在此也、</p>
<p>西門今日告知下院、海軍談話今仍在進行中、目前宣布詳情、實屬不智、但可示其廣大之輪廓、</p>
<p>日反對現行率　在目下談話中、日本曾提岀某種建議、其目的乃在商定一種制度、每國在此制度下得造艦至共同更高的限度、即達乎其應有之噸位總數是也、日本建議中之内容、及各方提岀融和異見之方法、今皆不能詳細奉告、</p>
<p>競争召致殃禍　西門繼曰、「英政府視海軍限制制度之破裂、為人人之大禍、不特將及於今會商之數國、且將及於全世界焉、各國若復作軍備競争、則財政與政治上所蒙之殃害、顯然可覩、無需侈述、英政府之代表毫不存打破談話之意志、苟餘一綫希望、而可覓融和争見之方法、則擬以極友好之精神進行談話、</p>
<p>為平等作解釋　平等之安全、為人人應有不可駁詰的權利、但此非謂各國艦隊大小應一律相同也、此端賴每一事件中的責任與其他一切之性質為定、吾人今所進行之討論、其主旨乃在盡力之所能、商定一種基礎、可依以獲得諒解、而不危及任何人安全之意義、苟能大概達到此點、則明年之大會、吾人覺有途徑可循矣、此當然尚須視簽約國如法意等之意見為定、</p>
<p>隨時通告法意　西門末謂英國恒以極密切與極友好之手續與他方面接觸、海軍談話之一切發展、均隨時通告法意代表云、（二十二日路透電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］英美海軍代表今晨會談後、切實决定繼續探討諸問題、雙方代表皆以為現無抛棄最後妥恊希望之理由、英代表曾以本星期初外相西門與日大使松平會談之情形告知美代表、英美代表團皆承認日本現唯關心共同最大限度一節、衆信雙方之探討、將集中於日本曷為需此、及英美對此要求可遷就至何地步、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］外相西門所主張各國在安全上平等一層、似已獲得美國海軍代表之同意、英美兩國代表現正考慮以安全平等為基礎、向日本提岀若干新問題、英相麥唐納與外相西門今晨在下院首相辦公室内與美國首席代表台維斯及美國大使館參贊阿德頓會商歷兩小時之久、談話後、據美國代表團人士云、麥唐納與西門曾以西門與日本松平大使會商之詳情、通知台維斯、繼乃由英美代表交換意見、歷時頗久、據聞結果極為滿意、並已决定繼續考慮成立諒解之可能、但英美二國間並未成立任何「恊定」、即成立「聯合陣綫一層、亦未成為問題、又聞今晨英美兩國代表談話、迄未逾越海軍問題之政治範圍、而涉及技術範圍、惟現行海軍談話進行程序、則曾提岀各點加以考慮、以上係由美國代表團方面所獲消息、舍此而外、一般人以為英美兩國間對於兩主要點意見、似已一致、一則美國代表表示、對於西門外相昨日在下院就安全平等所作之解釋、完全同意、二則英美兩國代表團似曾考慮以安全平等為基礎、向日本詢問謂其提岀海軍要求之理由、在於華盛頓條約簽訂後遠東情勢之變更、然則遠東情勢究有何種變更、足為英美兩國海軍增加實力之理由乎、或為日本海軍增加實力之理由乎、今晨英美兩國代表舉行談話後、台維斯即偕美國代表海軍參謀長史丹萊同赴鄉間、作高爾夫球之比賽、約於本日旁晚方可返敦倫、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［東京］據聞英美兩國從來有意在倫敦海軍會談提議遠東政治問題、以供討論、然至最近、海軍會談事實上致不能脱離停頓狀態、而英美方面盛傳改修九國及四國條約之説、在此時際、松平大使於十九日及二十一日會見西門外相談及政治問題之消息、俄然對於各面與以大衝動、據各方面所傳消息、松平西門兩人所談政治問題、似係一種太平洋羅加諾條約之新訂問題、據日本政府之意見、如此項新條約能促進日英美三國之視善關係、且能實現非戰工作、而於任何形式之下確立三國間和平、則日本不吝考慮此問題、而此項條約之訂立、並非九國條約或四國條約之更新、與此兩條約及海軍會談完全分離、而在確保太平洋和平之新基礎上、新訂所謂太平洋羅加諾條約之意也、但以此條約為决定日本兵力量之交換條件、則日本絶對反對之、（二十三日日聯電）</p>

<p>（一）質的限制</p>
<p>（二）太平洋防備上之限制</p>
<p>（三）通告造艦計畫</p>

<p>且上述各項均係訓令事項以外之件、當無請訓本國政府之必要、而一方面美國政府對於太平洋防備限制之單獨存留、表示絶對反對、是以該項中庸案、在日美兩國之代表團、其態度適為相反也、（二十二日日聯電）</p>

<p>［華盛頓］據美當局今日之私人表示、齋籐大使所提二·二·二海軍比率之建議、美政府仍不能接受、蓋海軍如此裁减之後、僅足為海上警察之用、而亞洲大陸不免全為日本所宰割矣、况此種辦法、將使英美拆毁之軍艦遠較日本為多、另據國務院方面表示、開放門户政策如不變更、則美國始終反對大規模裁减海軍之任何運動、（廿二日國民電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］昨日下午西門外相與日本駐英大使松平再度會晤之後、英國方面發言人謂「悲觀心理已較前减少」云云、本日日本代表山本少將特對本社記者發表談片、予以更正、謂昨日松平大使、與西門外相之談話、雖極懇切、但並非表示日本改變態度、日本代表仍决定繼續、誠懇努力、以期廢除華府海約、而代以較為適宜之條約、鄙意華府條約宜根本廢止、而不當考慮其某項條欵宜予保留、為今之計、宜樹立全世界妥恊之基礎、而不當僅以華盛頓條約簽字之五國（英美日法意）或倫敦條約簽字之三國（英美日）為範圍也、山本又謂、但若某某國家以為按之國際利益、華府海約關於質的限制、宜予以推廣、則余相信、日本必樂於贊成云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>海關奉財部命佈告週知</p>
<p>連日運岀頗鉅銀根奇緊</p>
<p>新新社云、財政部為防止現銀大量岀口、於十月十五日、增徵銀岀口税、並設立外匯平市委員會後、白銀岀口、已逐漸减少、惟日來國外銀價繼續高漲、時有奸商將銀運往内地、偷運岀口、致銀數岀境驟增、銀根益緊、財政部特於二十二日、令江海關、凡國内運輸現銀、須有財部護照、方准起運、各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>海關佈告憑照運銀</p>
<p>江海關監督唐海安·税務司伯樂德·發貼會銜佈告云、為布告事、現遵奉財政部關務署令、自本年十一月二十一日起、各銀行於國内運輸整箱或整袋銀幣、須經關騐明財政部護照、方准起運、如無護照運輸者、概以私運論、貨物照章没收、仰各商人等、一體周知、特此佈告、</p>
<p>防止奸商偷運岀口</p>
<p>新新社記者、昨由銀行界探悉、最近内地農産品、如棉花雜糧等、均經收穫、登市買賣、需銀應用、故日來上海銀幣運往内地各口岸之現銀、如漢口·天津·北平·汕頭·厦門·秦皇島·青島·烟台·等處、為數頗鉅、本月一日起至十五日止、約計有三百五十四萬元、但一般利慾商人、鍳於國外銀價仍較國内為高、乃乘此時機、將現銀轉流内地、再行偷運岀口、以圖牟利、外匯平市委員會、為防止偷運岀口起見、除呈請財政部令飭各海關、國内運銀、均須憑財部護照、方准起運外、對於每日上午十時公布之平衡税、均經縝密攷慮後、方决定公布、要亦减少偷運之意也、同時廣東·四川·甘肅·等省、亦頒布禁銀岀口之令、以防奸商偷運、</p>
<p>銀拆高漲二角五分</p>
<p>最近本市銀拆、以銀幣岀口驟增、存銀减少、銀根益感緊張、致銀拆一項、已由一角五分絡續高漲至二角五分、實為數年來未有之現象、蓋平時當秋冬季候、農産物登場之際、以各地需銀應用、銀拆一項、較春夏兩季為高、但未有如今歳之高漲二角五分者、此亦受大量現銀岀口之影響也、據金融界推測、此次海關公佈國内運輸銀幣、須憑財部護照、方准起運後、銀拆可望回降、</p>

<p>造費三百萬較原定計劃擴充</p>
<p>組專門委員會設計日内興工</p>
<p>完成之後江海關擬遷入辦公</p>
<p>市中心區内之唯一偉大建築虬江碼頭、自經市府計劃就緒後、本擬即行開工籌建、但以限於經費、故遲延迄今、猶未實現、最近中央銀行以該碼頭築竣之後、將來可以將外洋駛入黄浦江内之船舶、完全停於該處、不特有益水利商貨、抑且可以繁榮市面、與商務交通經濟等等、均有極大關係、故頗樂於投資、現决由中央銀行承辦、並組專門委員會進行、其計劃則較市府核定者尤為偉大、所費約達三百餘萬、堪為我國海關方面之唯一大工程也、兹探得其詳情如下、</p>
<p>銀行投資　虬江碼頭本為市中心區大建設内之一、年來市府對於市中心區建設工作、無日不在努力中、如市立醫院游泳池運動塲體育塲市立公園等、均先後興工、惟對於虬江碼頭之建築、雖有决心、而因該項工程非常偉大、規定經費達二百萬元、上海自一二八之後、市府收入突形减少、更無餘欵、以謀建造、於是此虬江碼頭之建造、無形停頓、最近中央銀行因該碼頭工竣之後、船舶運輸均將集中該地而市面繁榮、亦可有望、於是願投資承辦、業與市府數度接洽、已趨妥恊矣、</p>
<p>即日興工　中央銀行對於虬江碼頭、認為將來為發展市中心區商務經濟之唯一媒介機關、故而抱有絶大希望、按照市府原定計劃、建築虬江碼頭之費用、共計二百萬、該行擬擴大市府原定計劃、增加建築費、健全各種設備、現在預定之建造費約三四百萬元、已在組織專門委員會、進行此事、即日將興工築造、</p>
<p>形勢鳥瞰　虬江碼頭在黄浦江之中部、於楊樹浦軍工路之東北、其地為全黄浦江中之最深部份、江面潦濶、無論何種大輪、均可停泊、一面則可通淞滬路三民路、一方扼大江上下、地勢頗為雄偉、</p>
<p>海關遷入　江海關方面、現正在考慮一重大問題、即虬江碼頭落成之後、或將遷入、亦未可知、蓋現在之外洋輪駛入者、祗能止於楊樹浦碼頭、如再入内、則以楊樹浦以南、小輪密如星棋、時有相撞之虞、即江面狹窄、不能掉頭、故未能直入腹部、故如有大輪抵滬、海關必須派小輪自新關碼頭駛往接送、往來殊不便利、若虬江碼頭築成、一切輪船、均將直接泊於該碼頭、因彼處為吴淞口入内之第一碼頭、巨輪入口、可减少行程、兼之泊於該碼頭、搭客可以直接登岸、無須小輪接送、便利甚多、同時一切裝送缷貨、亦將在該碼頭、如江海關仍在新關、其税收必將大為遜色、故虬江碼頭成立、江海關或亦將遷入該地辦公也、</p>

<p>高呼救命　當時據張光華聲稱、渠在交通部航政局任職、其弟光洲、則在滬上學校肄業、昆仲兩人、早岀晚歸、毫無他異、來往友朋、亦甚寥寥、詎至昨晨五時左右、有法捕房第四五五號越捕正荷槍廵邏沿該坊經過、突聞二十四號屋有高呼救命之聲、乃急通第一九四號越捕及六四四號三八零號兩華捕、奔告附近鐵栅廵捕亭轉報捕房、</p>
<p>一死一傷　捕頭立派大批中西包探趕到、比入該屋、祗見張光華已倒臥於灶披間夾弄天棚上、滿身血汚、已奄奄一息、再至二樓亭子間察看時、見室門緊閉、遂一齊衝入、則見光洲裸體僵臥地上、鮮血滿地、頸上尚插有鋒利菜刀一柄、頭骨已斷、僅有寸許寸肉相連、業已斃命、探等檢查屋内、發現皮夾内儲有鈔洋百餘元、及一榻桌椅數事外、餘無長物、</p>
<p>傷者七刀　探等騐畢、即向闔宅同居之隣人查詢一過、均稱、彼等均在睡鄉、待聞得呼救聲岀視時、慘劇業已造成、兇手則一無所見云云、探等急用車將光華先送仁濟醫院救治、騐得週身共中七刀、計頭部五刀、頸畔右耳各一刀、光洲屍身則由騐屍所舁去、候報第二特院檢騐、中午十一時由王任檢察官蒞所、騐明委係刀傷身死、復傳集證人嚴金濤及二房東之子戴榮祥等訊問一過、</p>
<p>兇手四五　旋由包探將兇刀一柄呈案、官以死者在滬並無家屬、諭明由堂代殮、捕房復派探至仁濟醫院詢問張光華當時情形、據稱當時共有暴徒四五人闖入亭子間後、即一語不發、舉斧向我二人猛砍、余因跳岀窗外倖免、但已身受重創、至乃弟如何致死、則無從知悉云云、惟捕房以案岀離奇、曾向各方嚴密偵查、微聞得張光華已於前一日被航政局辭歇、</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第五回　諂笑逢迎挑燈照憔悴飢腸驅廹敷粉學風流</p>
<p>自己還在恨他呢，不想他先來陪禮，他也就跟着有了笑容了。其實賈多才乃是一種誤會。他以為李士廉按時請他，必是朱月英來了，到了院子門口，又見胡嫂子在這裏，他更是歡喜，一高興之下，就説了那句話，敷衍敷衍胡嫂子。不想走進李士廉的屋子，倒岀乎意外，張介夫郭敦品都在這裏，特别還有個二十來歳的女人。在西安，這女人雖是很華麗的，可是他的兩腮上搽的粉，都有些黏着不住，加上眼眶下隱隱的兩道青紋，這顯然是没有法子可以遮掩他那分兒憔悴。他似乎知道賈多才是個能花錢的人。因之賈多才一進門，他首先就站起來，笑臉相迎。賈多才正向他怔怔的望着呢，李士廉就搶着插身向前道：我來介紹介紹，這是賈先生，這是楊小姐，他號浣花，朋友們都呌他五小姐，我們也呌他五小姐呢。他還是我們同鄉呢。賈多才對他估量着，原以為是個風塵中人物，現在聽李士廉介紹的口氣，可有些不像，這也就不敢十分藐視於他，便點了頭笑道：五小姐倒是我們同鄉，難得的，那一縣？浣花向郭敦品看了一眼，這才笑着説的常熟兩個字。賈多才笑道：這更巧，而且是同縣。但是五小姐岀口音，有些變了，想是離開家鄉多年了。浣華道：九歳上就到上海去了，今年離家鄉……他説到這裏，不肯一口説了岀來，微偏着頭沉吟了許久，才笑道：也是九年多。李士廉向他笑道：二九一十八，五小姐今年十八歳嗎？（七二）</p>

<p>從前聼見老輩人説起一句古話：有一位淸寒的讀書人，自幼遭了大故，靠他的母親守節撫育長成，後來果然上進，得以置身貴顯；然而在當初依依膝下的時候，一想他的母親，茹苦含辛，雖在深宵人靜更闌，尚一手摇車，一手把紗條扯岀綫來，紡成了紗塊，積到可以織布，方始再換一番工作；所以他口裏琅琅的書聲，常和他母親紡紗車上的纒綿音節，時時不斷，就是隔壁鄰居人家，聼得這種攻苦的情形，也在睡夢中説一聲，唉！像這賢母佳兒，現在雖是吃苦，將來一定有書包翻身的一日哩！到後他想念讀書的成功，就在幼時母親燈火下紡紗伴讀的當兒，故得志後，就仿造了一部小小的車，供在家堂裏面，用作永久的一個紀念物；這是在吾鄉的一件故事。還有在上海，像就是四牌樓吧！有一位姓陳的，據説：初起是挑銅匠擔的，後來也發了財，竟成鉅富，於是他的子孫，不忍忘卻祖宗起家的本業，也做了一副很小的銅匠擔，安在家堂裏面，這都是以前罕聞的特别紀念品。喂！吾昨天在塔蔭啜茗，聼見老友汪望農君説：江灣有一個賣餛飩的，但不曉得姓甚名誰，他天天挑這副担，在下午岀來，不到深更半夜，不會回去；内為他每日所進的貨，必須賣完，方纔可以過活；不料他苦吃苦做，生意又來得不惡，日積月累，到也成了一個小康之家，後來改營麵坊，遇着粉價漲落的機會，真所謂時來運來，不到幾年，竟儼然作富家翁了。故你倘到這鎮上去問，不特他門閭高大，而他的家堂中，也置着赤金製成的餛飩擔在裏面，而且有鍋有柴有碗有杓，抽屜也層層排列，應有盡有，故我把他紀岀來，可見執業是没有大小的，苟能抱着恒心和毅力去做，都會得積財以致富啊。</p>
<h3 id="c146">點滴 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— （單觀瀾）</p>
<p>荷蘭童子，飽受了一夜的西北風，止住「點滴」似的海水，可免去變成澤國的巨災。</p>
<p>「點滴」大的沙泥，和其他的建築材料，能够完成一座二十二層的大厦。我們在跑馬廰畔，就可一目了然。</p>
<h3 id="c147">花村 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 盛嘯黎</p>
<p>花村，這是多麽美麗富有詩意的一個名稱，在大家理想中；一定是「一塊樂土」，「世外桃源」，或是大人先生們的别墅；可是事實上不盡然，或更有傷心的一頁在。吾且略為叙述：花村地處閘北彭浦趙家花園，居民四百餘户，多從事於花卉的生涯，該村四圍，都是花田花房圍繞着，的確是天然的幽着的環境。今秋黄警頑先生在該地創設一所學校，闢為鄉村教育實騐區，從事改良農人生活，試騐「花」的教育，兩個月以來，我們在工作之暇，輙漫步田野，花房，菜圃，竹籬，茅舍，差不多都有我們的足跡，農夫農婦，笑語嬉嬉，有説不岀的樂趣！我們從接近農人，得了不少的調查，前天我碰到一位農友，他説：「栽花已四十年了，年年的衣食，總是困難，真苦來些！」我很驚異地，問他一句：「為甚麽呢？」他説：我們的花，多半賣給外國人，連種子也仰給於外國了，用很高的價錢購種子，而花的代價悉聼外國人給，如果價錢賣大，花就賣不掉，」我聼了這番話，不由的起了感觸，花村真是外國人的植花地，農人間接做了次等的洋奴，花村的花，不是花村人民所有的，而是外國人的，花村有活的花，没有飽着肚子欣賞花的權利，以密邇上海花卉區，生命都操在外人手裏，唉，又有何説呢！</p>

<h3 id="c149">御香縹緲錄 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我暗暗在猜度；截至目前為止，太后究竟有没有感覺，到這裏所展露着的一派幽鬱蕭索的景象的難受？或者是伊感覺到了，只是伊還忍耐着，不願有什麽表示；或者是這種感覺根本還不曾印射到伊的神經上咧！因為伊無論如何康健，年齡畢竟已是高了，年高的人感覺，照例是不很靈敏的；再加伊今天是非常的疲倦，自然要格外的呆鈍些了。而我却還是一個年輕的人，又是一個特别善於幻想的年輕人。</p>
<p>就因為我太善於幻想，感情也就容易受衝動。此刻見了這一副幽鬱蕭索的夜景，不覺便有些後悔不該隨駕東來，大有立即回到北京去的想望。不過我自己也很明瞭自己的性情，這種想望雖然是發生了，但只是神經上一時受了激刺後的閃動，决不會變為一種熱烈的要求的；也許睡過一夜之後，到明天就不再這樣想了！</p>
<p>可是無論如何，我的膽子總不能勉强放大起來，正像一個小孩子在床上做了可怕的惡夢一樣，就是醒來之後，也會嚇得哭的。我的神經上既起了這種有涉魔鬼的幻覺，眼前便是像有許多的鬼影，在這幅員廣大而光線不足的古宫裏憧憧地來往。我而且還不住的給自己解釋道：「真的！這裏是一定有鬼的！正和北京的皇宫裏一定有鬼一樣。這兩處的宫院中，幾千年或幾百年來，已不知道有多少的人死在裏面了；他們的屍骸雖已運岀去埋葬了，但他們的靈魂是永遠會存留着的。（一八二）</p>
<h3 id="c150">蘆笋之又一辯正 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— （不榖）</p>
<p>前幾天在本刋上讀南宫生關於蘆笋的文字，心下頗有點將信將疑；後來又讀負負生的辯正，遂鬆了一口氣，不過還有一點誤會，索性寫給大家討論。</p>
<p>據我所知，蘆笋是分根種植的，莖叢生，細葉和榖茴很象，笋就是它在土中的嫩芽，初種數月，不見得就可採取的，大約要在一年以上。培養的方法，大致同我們培韮菜的差不多，不過不是全株給他培没，只把根頭的土時時加高而已。</p>
<p>杭州有一位農業家湯先生，他曾有蘆笋種着，可見這東西在國内也可以種的，不要以為這祗是舶來品，而任它每年的輸入罷！很希望有志於農業救國者注意及之。</p>
<p>啓事　兹據火雪明君來函，告發十日「秋遊特刋」中棲霞樓主之「金華變龍洞」係抄襲其四月間舊作「進雙龍洞去」此等卑劣行為，可惡已極，除取消其潤資外，特此聲明。</p>

<h3 id="c151">旅京兩日記 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 吟秋</p>
<p>南京本係舊遊之地，最初認識，尚在距今十五年前，學生時代，投考升學，意氣甚壯。及任事後，在省會未遷鎮江以前，因服務社會教育，集會商討，每年到京，至少兩三次；惟最近三年來，從未一往。此次代表省立蘇州圖書館同人，赴京岀席省立社會教育機關職教員聯會，得遊舊地，留宿兩宵，適值風雨，來去匆匆，僅成小詩十絶，戯用唐人原韵，藉誌泥雪云爾！</p>
<p>其一：登車晤支，用張説蜀道後期韵。「故人車上遇，相互問行程，君上梁溪路，我來白下城。」十一月十一日，適逢星期，乘九時許特快車時，有京滬滬杭甬特别黨部謁陵團團員二百餘人，且在往宜興探游善卷庚桑等洞者，旅客甚衆，車中極為擁擠。車既開，忽見中山體專校長朱了洲君，渠至無錫下車，僅互問行程而已。</p>
<p>其二：車中望遠山，用李白秋浦歌韵。「經霧漸開霽，車行不覺長，遠山窗外送，紅葉醉凝霜。」開車時，雲霧濛濛，虎邱塔影，幾不可辨，直至無錫，漸見雲散霧開，青山紅樹，遠送車窗，為之一快。</p>
<p>其三：抵京寓漱石軒，用戴叔倫三閭廟韵。「客舍何精雅，幽然曲徑深，小軒題漱石，殘菊滿園林。」自下關入城，皆平坦大道，汽車所經，兩旁多新建築，金碧輝煌，氣象宏麗，彷彿瓊宫仙闕。郵局銀行等，悉成巍厦，直至四象橋一帶，市面之繁榮，已非昔比。寓中正街交通旅社，閙中取靜，地頗幽雅，花園中有漱石軒，池水生波，菊叢吐艷，頗得曲徑通幽之趣。</p>
<p>其四：夜雨，用韋應物秋夜寄丘員外韵。「旅店深宵靜，恰逢細雨天，窗前多翠竹。颯颯未成眠。」因明日總理誕辰，旅館中多謁陵團團員，人衆聲雜，深夜始靜，正思入夢，而竹窗雨聲，淅瀝作響，旅人聼此，致未熟睡。</p>
<p>其五：赴會，過公園道上，用令狐楚思君恩韵。「久别公園路，滄桑感慨多，最難忘舊事，曾共老人過。」十二日冒雨，赴公園路南京民教館，即開會之地，沿途正翻築馬路，車行繚繞，既至，知會中舊雨，大半星散，所見多係新知。回想昔年曾兩度偕陶小沚老先生至此，今已早歸道山，不盡悵觸！</p>
<p>其六：會畢，酒樓赴宴，用李適之罷相作韵。「羣賢欣畢集，勝會共銜杯，風雨樓頭客，多從遠處來。」是日開會時，討論社會教育實施問題甚詳，南京民教館同人，於會畢後，公宴各機關岀席代表於夫子廟前酒樓。座中有來自南通淸江等地者，觥籌交錯，頗極一時一盛。</p>
<p>其七：客窗坐雨，用錢起江行望匡廬韵。原約孫陸去，泥途不可登，客窗聼雨久，默坐靜如僧。原約於會畢後，乘總理誕辰，同往恭謁陵墓；因天雨不止，路上泥濘，且陵上石級高峻，滑不易支，致未如願，惟有留待他日耳。</p>
<p>其八：秦淮獨眺，用韋應物答李澣韵。「作各無多日，喜偷忙裏閒，秦淮新漲碧，倦鳥欲飛還。」傍晚雨止，散步朱雀路烏衣巷一帶，景象如昔，而路政大佳。至秦淮小公園，見湖水漲碧，已無曩時乾涸之象。略市食品數色，凖備明日遄返，蓋歸思已切矣。</p>
<p>其九：歸途早發，用駱賓王易水送别韵。「夢覺天初曙，披衣且整冠，登車行客少，一路曉風寒。」黎明即起，而雨尚未止，在天色朦朧中，乘汽車至下關，車行至疾，曉風甚冷，天或可望轉晴也。</p>
<p>其十：抵家，用岑參行軍九日思長安故園韵。「莫道行期促，匆匆去又還，抵家如久别，妻子笑顔開。」車過鎮江，天色漸霽，抵蘇已陽光四展，入城到家，時僅過午，雖暫小别，而妻兒迎門，歡言一室，恍如遠客之初歸也。</p>

<h3 id="c167">無綫電收發音機在飛機上之裝置 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 振民</p>
<p>近年來，無綫電之用於飛機，日見增加，此允為無綫電史上光明之一頁，頗值得我人注意與研究，兹將其最新裝置法，略述於後，想亦讀者所樂聞也，</p>
<p>（一）飛機上用無綫電之機件</p>
<p>飛機上所用各種無綫電機件，較陸地上所用者無大差異，所不同者，僅設計問題，使其能適合航空上之特殊情形而已，最緊要者，機件質量必須極輕，同時佔據之體積必須極小，以便飛機携帶不發生困難，而機件各部之構造，必極度堅强，雖經飛機行駛時之强烈振動而不生變態，是以各件活動部分，在一度調和後，應絶對鎖住其地位，真空管之底座，須用軟質海綿狀橡皮製成，無綫電箱亦應放置於富於吸振性之墊褥上，使猛烈之振動减至極小。</p>
<p>除上述諸端外，尚有一最要點，即一切綫路中，絶對不能發生火星爆發之現象，因飛機兩翼。類皆用油布或引火之油漆塗抹，而引擎發動時，每有汽化之軋士林，一觸火星，立可使全機爆炸或燃燒，是以一切綫路外表，均應用强度之絶縁物包裹，而一切綫路，均應緊繫機身木框上，勿使振動，一切開關均應特製，使能隔離外界空氣，（如用外殻等）。</p>
<p>一切綫路之用於陸地者，均能適用於飛機，惟蓄電池之應用，頗感困難，因充電問題，在飛機連續行駛中，難以舉行也，用極小之發電機以得電能，現已證明有極好之效果，此種發電機，可裝於機翼上，或裝於推進器之後，藉機身前進時之空氣壓力以推動發電機上之小風扇，而生摩電作用，此發生之電流，可用特種真空管及電阻器調節之，使保持恒定之輸送。</p>
<p>（二）天綫裝置及收音發音</p>
<p>飛機無綫電用之天綫，約分二種，即（一）「圏狀天綫（Loop）」，（二）「呈露天綫」（Open），「圏狀天綫」，即普通陸地所常用者，頗適合於短波收發，至於「呈露天綫」則採用較廣，其圖如後：</p>
<p>此種天綫，係用長三百尺之裸綫製成，一端繫於機身上之天綫轉軸，他端繫小鉛塊，使飄動空中，此天線經過導引管而引岀機外，（如圖一）導引管内部係金屬表面，與天線直接接觸，而通至無綫電箱，使電路銜接，天綫之長短，能用轉軸以調節之（飛機降下時，天綫需收短，以免折斷）。</p>
<p>因鉛質小塊下墮之重量，每使飛機失却平衡力，補救之法，可在引擎部分加以適當之平衡物，電波的播射作用可在（圖二）中看岀，因天綫裝置之不平衡，每使電軸移動，是以最高電波的收送，常稍徧機身之右，此駕駛者所應注意者也。</p>
<p>導引管之剖面圖，可於（圖三）中詳視，外管係電木或他種絶縁體製成，緊裝於機身旁面，内管係金屬製，天綫即在此管内通過，内管旁有接綫端一，以便接通電箱。</p>
<p>天綫之長度隨電波長度而異，普通習慣上，天綫之長度（英尺），適等於表上所指明之波長，但因波長與飛機之平衡及方向有密切關係，是以天綫長度應隨時用轉軸調節，以應付一切特殊情形。</p>
<p>近來採用雙天綫之趨勢日廣，此種裝置，與前無異，僅機身之右旁，更裝一同樣之天綫，每綫之長度約一百五十英尺，採用雙天綫之主要益處，即機身容易平衡，駕駛不生困難，收音亦較容易也。</p>

<h3 id="c171">成音週率放大器的週率特性 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>成音週率放大器是任何收音機不可少的主要部份，因其輸入週率，均在成音範圍以内，自無需調諧，故其週率特性，在設計時，似無庸顧及，但一般的成音週率放大器，對於各高低不同的成音週率，實不能盡均等的放大任務。尤其在一○○○○週率以上的訊號，此點與失真問題，亦極有關係，不可漠視，欲免除此弊，設計成音週率放大器時，應先注意下列三條：</p>
<p>第一，要保持各週率的放大力均等，每一級所獲得的放大力，應略為犧牲，過荷的真空管，雖可得强大輸岀，但决不能平衡放大，完成此點，真空管的負荷電阻（Loand　Resistance）應擇較小者。</p>
<p>第二，成音週率放大真空管，須擇具有較小的輸入電阻者，所有三極管，幾全可適合此條件，如201A，37，56等，30號尤為相宜，此點可使低週率的放大力增加。</p>
<p>第三，關於交連方法的選擇。變壓器及廻阻交連，因感應性的影響，極易阻碍放大力的均等：直接交連，使用過久後，常發生不穩定之弊，亦不甚滿意，以最好還以採取通用的電阻交連法為佳。</p>
<p>上述三點之外，更有幾項方法，可調節或增加各種週率的放大力：</p>
<p>放大管屏路内，可添接一ＬＣ的並聯電路（如圖Ａ），如遇某種週率的放大力較低時，可調整ＬＣ電路，使與此週率諧振，此時ＬＣ對於諧振週率的廻阻最高，Ｌ上的電壓降亦最大，此電壓降將加在屏電阻之電壓降上，使獲得音量增强。</p>
<p>增加放大器音量的另一法，可利用再生力（Regeneration）參閲圖Ｂ，電容器Ｃ即係産生再生力者，僅需極小的電容量，一部份輸岀電能，即可藉此回授至輸入電路，但須注意回授電能不可過强，致使真空管振盪，其情形與檢波級之採用再生力完全相同，讀者自能明瞭。</p>
<p>真空管的栅屏極間電容量，對於高週率訊號，極感不利，如能依圖Ｃ的方法平差後，高週率的音量當可增加。</p>
<p>要增加低週率的音量，訊號回至地極間的廻阻，須减至極低，此法可添接傍路電容器Ｃ（圖Ｄ）。</p>
<p>成音週率放大器，如能依上述各條，逐一試之，則無論週率的高低，都可得最大的均等放大力，工作效能，自可較勝一般。</p>
<h3 id="c172">「銲」的方法 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>要一架無線電機的成績好，則第一須使機中接綫處聯接良好，庶電流能暢行無阻，而後全機能正常工作。「銲」為使接線聯接良好之唯一方法，其方法亦甚簡單，但亦需相當之器具與手法，否則難得美滿之效果。今略銲的方法如下，以供參考。</p>
<p>在未銲前，先將器具齊集一處。計烙鐵，銲劑，銲錫，及加熱器具等。烙鐵，通無線電材料店亦有岀售，其銅頭應擇較大者，（重四十或五十格蘭姆者最為適宜）因較小者加熱後易於冷却，而有頻頻加熱之煩；如能有電烙鐵。則運用更便。銲劑乃用以去除被銲接之金屬表面上之養化物者，如松香，硼砂，鹽酸，碯砂，緑化鋅等，此處則應採用松香，因其價廉易得，且無腐蝕性也。銲錫乃一種易鎔之錫合金，中國銅錫店有岀售，俗呼「鈎光」。加熱器具以大號酒精燈最為便利，用炭爐亦可；但煤爐則不適用，因煤中含有硫質易與烙鐵之銅頭化合而成硫化銅，有妨銲接；如用電烙鐵，則用電流加熱。</p>
<p>諸物齊備，乃使烙鐵「受錫」（未受錫之烙鐵，銲錫不能附着其上）法先將烙鐵之尖端磨亮，乃充分加熱至達暗紅，並以松香少許使溶其上，然後塗銲錫於其尖端，使有光亮之錫一薄層即可。</p>
<p>銲時，先將銲接處括亮，使呈金屬之光輝，乃設法絞合之，並置松香一小粒於其上。然後以已受錫之烙鐵，溶取適量之銲錫，而使此銲錫充份分佈於被銲之處，俟冷固結即成。</p>
<p>工作時有數點應加注意。甲，加熱烙鐵不可過份，否則其尖端所受之錫，必因過熱而消失，致以後不能粘附銲錫。（如已不能粘附銲錫，應補行「受錫」以補救之）故加熱時至已能溶化銲錫為度（烙鐵之銅頭旁發生緑色火熖時，即表示加熱已足）。乙，銲時被銲處之温度，必須在錫錫之溶解點上，否則不能銲牢。丙，本法適用於接銲銅，黄銅，鐵，錫，鉛，鋅等金屬，而不適用於銲鋁。</p>
<p>銲之方法甚為簡單，如能略加練習，則臨事無不得手應心也。</p>

<p>自從長短波收音機盛行以來，一般自製有短泉機的業餘家們，也不在少數。可是在收聽的時候，却没有收聽廣播那麽便利，非得在外國短波雜誌裏面，找尋登載的播音時間，再從地圖中檢查經緯度和計算時差等麻煩手續不可。下面一張最近增訂的時間表，是在西文報紙中見到的我想這對於愛好短波的同志們是多少有些用處。所以立刻給抄譯了岀來。裏面雖祗十五家短波播音臺，可都是歐洲和澳洲很著名的大電臺，假使你有一架用二隻30的小小短波接收機，祗要綫○配合得準確，和良好的天地綫，便可按時一一收聽了。</p>

<p>— 蔡光華</p>
<p>時間和節目</p>
<p>播音時間，是從早晨六時至午後十時，節目的内容，包括政府公報，天氣預測，教育，娱樂，兒童時間等等，時間和節目，都是由恊會方面，聘請各種專家，組織放送審議會而制定的，近二年來，恊會方面，曾經徵求過幾次聽衆意見，需要任何樣的節目，報紙方面，每天也讓岀好些地位來登載和討論當日的節目，所以這幾年來的廣播節目，日本人自己也覺得有很顯著的進步，不特在量的方面，並且是質的方面。</p>
<p>在廣播電台領導下的早操是值得提起的，這種節目，無形中變成了全國的健康運動，第二次夏季無綫電體操在一九三三年八月舉行的時候，三五八○○○○○以上的人，參加了二十天左右。</p>
<p>為了要使各地的聽衆們，都能够完全了解報告員的言語（日本語中亦有方言，如東京與九洲之方言，絶然不同），恊會方面，有標準化全國語言的運動，將來對於全國語言文化上，一定有很大的貢獻。</p>
<p>至於娱樂方面，上至貴族化的「能劇」，下午平民化的「浪花節」（古代日本戲劇）以及古今音樂，新舊民謡，都是不斷地在播送着，較大的電台裏，都有管弦樂隊的組織，平常正午的音樂節目，大都全是管弦樂隊在播送的，晚上八九時左右，大概是中繼寶塚少女歌舞劇塲的歌舞劇，那是娱樂節目中最受歡迎的了。</p>
<p>教育方面，包括「成人教育講座」，「婦女教育講座」，「外國語講座」等等，不下十餘種類，尤其值得注意的是「非常時講座」，以往的是東北事變，日本退岀國聯等等演講，現在進行的是第二次世界大戰和投資「滿洲國」的演講，什麽「滿洲是日本的陸地生命綫」哩，「南洋羣島是日本的海洋生命綫」哩，無時無地，無非在替日本國民打强心針而已。</p>
<p>其他如每年春秋二季在東京神宫競技場舉行的大學聯盟棒球賽，以及年常夏季由朝日新聞社主催的全國中學聯盟棒球賽等等，都由東京ＪＯＡＫ將實况放送，那是運動節目中最受人歡迎的了。（未完）</p>

<p>買方準備收貨標紗漸有回高趨勢</p>
<p>紗市趨堅、形勢甚緊、因買方凖備收貨、致人心頗挺、而金融界意態觀高、所以市勢漸向高峯推進、但現紗銷路較為淸澹、故大户空額仍不抵補云、</p>

<p>遠月花漲勢有力　標棉前市開盤尚佳、惟日商將近月撤岀三四千担、致檯面略鬆、同時通成公司放岀近月、購進遠月、結果近跌五分至二角半、遠漲五分、午後形勢突緊、因有一部份抵補、而印棉仍有漲風、各月均漲二三角、全日成交統計十二萬九千九百担、查賣岀瑞源一千九百担、元一一千担、瑞昌四千二百担、達記一千三百担、吉豐四千九百担、大孚二千九百担、穗隆一千二百担、賡豐三千四百担、均昶一千二百担、義成二千六百担、長豐四千七百担、永昌一千八百担、源興昌三千五百担、買進德記一千八百担、恒益三千九百担、慎記一千七百担、仁豐五千六百担、同興四千一百担、益康三千九百担、新享二千二百担、長和一萬三千九百担、大豐一千七百擔、崇安三千擔、長餘二千二百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>手工可以打倒機器　外行能做信封并印名片</p>
<p>信封一物，本非内行不能製，手工業中認為一種專門行業，稱為信封作坊，自從有了機製信封以來，手工業竟被打倒，無立足之餘地，實屬可憐而又可氣，現在我來想岀一個法子，原有的信封作坊，專門只裱不做，使得産量增加一倍以上，由我們廠裏切好了信封坯子，並且劃好了線路摺痕，只要糊口，便成功了，所以全外行，也都能做，以牙粉袋為比例，每人每日能做二千。即得工資四角，任何一處地方，都能就地做，就地賣，現在的信封，大都要印廣告的，所以這一門生意，只要向本地的印刷家接洽一下，做好的白坯信封，供給他們去印，他們只要便宜，比較機製信封，還可便宜一點，當然是歡迎樂用的了，因為機製信封的工錢，每萬需四元（裱工在外），所以在人工便宜之處，還可以拿手工來打倒機器，而且我們因為自己造紙，目的祗在推廣紙的銷路，所以特地把這做工留下，給與内地的人工賺去，使得你們的賣價，還可以比那機製信封，每萬便宜一二元，印刷店的銷用數目動輙十萬廿萬，他們定向便宜路走的，所以銷路儘可不愁，但有一二百元的資本，即可成為一種恒業，别種東西，還怕擱煞了永無銷路，信封是没有時間性的，所以我説最穩妥的小本工業，是無過於此的了，若要自己印刷紅簽，也很容易，我們已經做成一套簡便的鉛印器械，排好了紅簽版子，配好了油墨膠輥，自己就能印了，而且還可印名片呢，這一套器械，只需五元，豈不便宜之至，</p>

<h3 id="c187">孩子獅子駱駝 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 向隅</p>
<p>我也要像尼采一樣來説教，不過我的意見却是與尼采完全相反的。尼采説：「精神的三種變形，我鄭重地指示給你們：精神怎樣變做一隻駱駝，駱駝怎樣變成一隻獅子，及最後獅子怎樣變成一個孩子」（見現代叢書薩拉圖斯屈拉如此説的英譯本）；而我認為精神的三種變形，如果是自然發展的話，却是一個孩子變做一隻獅子，獅子變做一個駱駝。由於岀發點的不同，意見分歧差度，自然就很大，因為尼采是主張超人的，然而他的所謂超人，却不是我們這種社會所能找得岀。所以他所説的一隻載重的駱駝，一到了荒野，就須蜕變而成為一隻荒野主人的獅子，又因獅子不能在荒野中創造新的價值，獅子又必變為天真的健忘的，新開始的極端肯定的孩子——他的超人世界觀，根本存在於現實之外，不是我所瞭解的。而我們是主張俗人的，這是一個事實，並不是一個理想，其實用不着什麽主觀上的主張。在任何社會裏面，隨處都碰到這些俗人，誰都是俗人之一。五官俱全，百體皆備，没有缺少什麽，没有多岀什麽，就是標準的俗人。偶然也有一二個人與人家有一些特殊的地方，然而即是有一些特殊的地方，也並不是超人的特徵。假使有，在俗人的社會中，恐怕這不足以自豪，適足以當為笑柄。</p>
<p>所以在俗人的社會，找不岀超人，根本也不允許超人的存在。一個孩子生下來，你就會看到他的父母教他怎樣成為一個俗人，他的師長教他怎樣成為一個俗人；他的社會怎樣教他成為一個俗人：他是天真的，然而他的父母師長社會却要教他懂事，所謂懂事，自然是懂俗人的事：他是健忘的，然而他的父母師長社會却要教他不要忘記，所謂不要忘記也自然是不要忘記俗人的事：他是極端肯定的，然而他的父母師長社會却要教他你應當怎樣（Thou　Shall），你不准怎樣（Thou　Shall　nat）所謂你應當怎樣，你不應當怎樣，自然是教他做俗人准許做的事，不做俗人所不准許的事，（這在三千四百年前的摩西十誡「The　Commandments」已開其端）。待到孩子成人，他的身體，雖變做獅子般有力，他的性格雖還有獅子般的野性，他却是社會中的馴伏的一分子，而絶不是荒野中的主人，他是一隻被社會拘放在籠中的獅子呀！等到他上了年紀，他的眼所見的，是俗人的事；他的耳中所聼的是俗人的事；他的鼻中所嗅的是俗人的氣味；他的心中所想的是俗人的概念；再加上過去幾千年的傳統，目前不可淸算的社會習俗，他是一個十足的載重的駱駝。</p>
<p>我認為在俗人的社會中，精神的變形是一個孩子變做獅子，獅子變做駱駝。</p>
<h3 id="c188">再談「一法通」 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>吴懈的「一法通」，最近由岳州陸獨步先生寄給我了。吴老先生這部書真是有趣得很。書首有他一篇序文，作於「光緒乙巳年七月」，頁扉載明「光緒丙午年刻」，計算起來，剛近三十年了。</p>
<p>他為什麽作這部書呢？</p>
<p>原來他是想拿這個代替蒙學課本的。那個時候新學堂裏所用的蒙學課本，大約先認字，後講字。字是實字，又呌靜字。積了幾十個字後，纔學填字拼句。這當然要比從前私塾呆讀四書五經的方法進步。可是吴老先生還認為這個方法不够，以為單字難記，不如一面認字講字，一面講句拼句，而且實字虚字理應同授，何苦分别？所以他要另編「一法通」這部書。在我看來，這果然要比當時蒙學課本如「字課圖説」一類的書要好十倍。可惜我在初學的時候不曾得到這部書，不然，我在語言文字的學習上，或許要少吃一些苦頭了。</p>
<p>究竟他這部書是不是可以教初學呢？</p>
<p>據吴老先生自己的經騐，他説：</p>
<p>「吾家學童講經三年不通者，講此一年無不通也。不能作家書者，無不能也」。</p>
<p>這當然是可靠的話。你想，對小孩子講經書裏的聖人之大道，怎麽講得通呢？講三年也没有用處的。「一法通」是用諺語編成的韻書，既容易讀得上口，又容易講得明白，還容易記得在心，當然讀讀講講，一年就通，而且能够寫家信的。吴老先生並不菲薄經書，也不反叛聖人之道。可是為了小孩子學習的幸福，就不主張讀經講經，對於那個時候新學堂的蒙學課本，既有相當的理解，還要自己動手編一部諺語讀本。三十年前的老先生有此見解，説起來真呌我們這輩不長進的後生小子愧死！</p>
<p>這部書是按照韻目的次序分韻纂輯的，一共三卷，分訂三册，現在我把末了一卷末了一篇「月」韻的諺語節錄一點於下，以見本書内容之一斑。</p>
<p>船過得，舵過得。告箇曲，唱不得。</p>
<p>不刮風，冷也得。不欠賬，窮也得。</p>
<p>上房絶，下房業。上屋叔，下屋伯。</p>
<p>痳要洩，痘要結。包一切，掃一切。</p>
<p>宗有功，祖有德。北走胡，南走越。</p>
<p>不怕胡説，只怕無説。</p>
<p>榖討八月，錢討臘月。</p>
<p>中了山客，不中水客。</p>
<p>打金識金，打鐵識鐵。</p>
<p>兇手一千，苦主八百。</p>
<p>有此賢東，無此惡客。</p>
<p>破衣藏蝨，破屋藏賊。</p>
<p>殺人見血，救人救徹。</p>
<p>娶妻娶德，娶妾娶色。</p>
<p>父子雖親，財心各别。</p>
<p>會打官司，只打半截。</p>
<p>畫水畫聲，畫火畫熱。</p>
<p>士各有志，何至相廹？</p>
<p>鋌而走險，急何能擇？</p>
<p>賒一千，不必現八百。</p>
<p>真的假不得，假的真不得。</p>
<p>百貨中百客，棉花中絮客。</p>
<p>進門觀顔色，岀門觀天色。</p>
<p>壁上字難貼，席上話難説。</p>
<p>大生意怕折，小生意怕歇。</p>
<p>棋是荒田板，牌是賣田册。</p>
<p>話説眼翻白，此人交不得。</p>
<p>江湖一點訣，莫對妻兒説。</p>
<p>鐵匠不落鐵，當面夾一截。</p>
<p>賣漿而遇天寒，賣肉而遇天熱。</p>
<p>醫行三代必發，醫行三代必絶。</p>
<p>請客莫請女客，請五十，來一百。</p>
<p>火爐裏煨泥鰍，喫一截，煨一截。</p>
<p>起家好似針挑上，敗家猶如湯泡雪。</p>
<p>上自頂心泥丸宫，下至脚板湧泉穴。</p>
<p>猴子檢塊薑，喫又喫不得，丢又丢不得。</p>
<p>公修公得，婆修婆得。各修各得，不修不得。</p>
<p>上面這些話，都是現在湖南民間流行的俗話，當然其中有許多是各地方共同有的。這種活的語言，很可作為白話文中的詞藻，莫説白話的詞彚貧乏，要從古典書籍裏面去找。依我個人的愚見，這部書可以呌做「諺語讀本」。倘若有人把各地的諺語彚集起來，就用吴老先生的這種分韻編法，編成一部「大衆語韻府」，供一般新作家撏撦詞藻之用，免得到古書堆裏去找，以致誤入歧途，真是功德無量！</p>

<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>被扯痛了耳朶的人，一面摸着發紅的耳朶笑着嘲弄。</p>
<p>起先，我只覺得有點詫異，現在却給這句話，也惹得發笑了，因為由女主人起皺的臉和脱落了兩三個牙齒的情形看來，她確實的年齡，倒彷彿正該把十五歳顛轉來，説是五十歳哩。</p>
<p>「哪像十五歳哩！」她一面把兩傘提到門前，朝外洒落着上面的水滴，有口無心地接着説，同時偶有所屬似地嘆了口氣，「那時候，哪一個不把我錯認成李家的小姐呢？唉，又穿又戴的，……」她的視線射着大路對面混有烟雨的擺夷村莊和春末的田野，沉默了一會兒。</p>
<p>大約我的三個同伴，都早已熟識了她的身世吧，並無興趣提問她這句話内藴藏着的故事，只是更加有味地打趣起來。</p>
<p>「嘻嘻，為何又抛了小姐不做呢？到如今，只落得……，又怪誰……」</p>
<p>私烟販子竟然用着從城裏聽來的京調，譏諷地唱着，但把太猥襲了的字眼，咽在喉嚨管上，却不吐了岀來。</p>
<p>她一下覺岀是在嘲笑她了，馬上掉轉身來，將備傘　私烟販子那裏，向空處打了一下，扳起面孔斥責似地反問道：</p>
<p>「要不是那個母老虎使烙鐵烙人家的背，誰肯跑到夷方壩呢？」</p>
<p>大概又因為我是個生人吧，她不安地望了我一眼，又接着朝私烟販，翹起兩片圍有皺紋的薄嘴皮。</p>
<p>「要是你，早就死在那個窩落裏了！」</p>
<p>説這話的時候，她的聲調裏好像滿含有驕傲和光榮似的。私烟販子並不回答，只在拭着洒在臉龐的水點，罵道：</p>
<p>「他娘的，丢開你的傘哪！」</p>
<p>這時擺夷僧人好像已經吹暢快兩三口烟，過足一點癮了，坐起來，將睡散了的袈裟，朝肩上重新搭了一下，一面朝煮烟的男子那裏，高興地招呼一聲。</p>
<p>「者弄，好了吧。」</p>
<p>她便趕快走過去，小心地應酬。</p>
<p>「佛爺再要一盒嗎？」</p>
<p>等擺夷僧人走了之後，她就躺了下去，抓着烟槍，朝煮烟的男子，柔聲媚氣地喊道：</p>
<p>「快來躺一躺，我燒一塊好泡子給你！」</p>
<p>抬滑竿的就將身邊的人攔腰一摟，擠眉丢眼地小聲説道：</p>
<p>「你看多恩愛呵！」</p>
<p>私烟販子却恢復了他的常態，打了一個哈欠，扁扁嘴似聲道：</p>
<p>「呸，一條老母猪！」</p>
<p>這時我突然明白他們剛才對我的話，加以嘩然大笑的原因了，但心裏却掛上了一脈神異的霧彷彿籠在擺夷她方的雨和烟一樣。</p>
<p>男子並没有到床上去吃烟，而且也像没有答應，只是把崛强的背顯示濃濃上昇的蒸汽裏面。</p>
<p>年老的女主人，生氣地把烟槍朝木盤裏一投，嘆了一聲，就默默地睡着。</p>
<p>我們都不開腔了，一齊把無聊的眼光，朝門外望去，籠着烟雨的樹林和茅屋，一會兒朦朧地現了岀來，一會兒又隱了進去，變成天地一色，但簷頭的雨滴，却一直没有停息地響着。</p>

<h3 id="c192">覆「啼笑皆非」 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 茜蒂</p>
<p>想不到自由談上的「茄蕉的馬來亞人」竟能引起苕茵先生「啼笑皆非」，這使小子多麽榮幸啊！</p>
<p>但是，可惜苕茵先生的眼光只喜觀看大的，而不喜歡看小的，因之就使苕茵先生陷於錯誤的牢籠裏去「啼笑皆非」！</p>
<p>苕茵先生以為我在自由談上所説的中國人同化力的大，只是從賭博這一點小小的事説起，而没有説岀「大到什麽地步給我們證明」，因而就「不敢相信中國人有同化馬來亞人的能力」。從這裏就充分看岀了苕茵先生的眼光是只喜歡看大的，而不喜歡看小的，因為賭博是小小的事喲。</p>
<p>但是，我們觀察某一個事物，須得從牠的最細微處去體認，才能體認岀牠的真實性來。要是只喜歡觀察牠的大處或牠的外形，那就常會把認識弄錯誤。中國人在南洋同化馬來人的事例自然是有很多，而我僅以賭博一例舉岀來的原因，就是認為賭博是最容易流入下層社會而使人迷戀的事物，中國人與馬來亞人是兩個語言文字風俗習慣不同的民族，在這兩個截然不同的民族中想同化而為一個民族，絶不是一十二十年或百十年間所能完成的，更不是像甲乙兩堆泥土可以馬上揑成一個隨意所欲的偶像，牠是必須經過悠久的歳月的同化作用，才能完成的。所以當兩個民族開始同化時，必然是從日常生活中的最小事件開始，最小的事件雖不是只有賭博一項，但賭博却是日常生活中的最小事件之一。我們能否認茄蕉的馬來亞人，在賭博的思想上不被中國人開始同化了麽？假如茄蕉的馬來亞人，没有英人在政治上的保護，再過百數十年後，安知不會被中國人完全同化麽？</p>
<p>細察苕茵先生的意思，以為我只舉賭博例子未免太小了。好的，讓我來舉一兩個較大的例子給苕茵先生看吧。但究竟大到若何程度，我却不知道，須得請苕茵先生自己去測量。</p>
<p>第一，在南洋羣島中，有一小島，葡萄牙的領土，地名呌帝汶（又名的摩爾）那裏用的是中國的銅錢，説的是中國言語，而風俗習慣也完全是從中國帶去的舊有的形式，在那地方的馬來亞人就不想同中國人同化也將為不可能之事。</p>
<p>第二，在荷屬勿里洞的一個山間小埠（地名我一時記不淸了）那兒不只民間流行着中國語言，而在法庭上還用着中國的語言呢。</p>
<p>從這兩點看來，苕茵先生總不會再有「不敢相信中國人有同化馬來亞人的能力」吧。實在説來，目前在英荷各屬的馬來亞人，因為有英荷兩帝國主義在政治上的保䕶，才能保持其暫時的生存，不然的話，他們恐怕老早就要被人淘汰了。</p>
<p>最後我所要説的，就是近年來英國人的積極排華，主要的原因自然是為經濟恐慌的嚴重化，然而，中國人在漸漸地同化馬來亞人，也是促成其排華的原因之一。歐戰以前的南斐洲，墨西哥，舊金山以及荷屬東印度等地的排華，那時根本就不是為了經濟恐慌，因為那時的資本主義還正在黄金時代呢。那時他們的排華，是因為中國人到處都以其堅忍耐勞的精神，取土人之地位而代之，致使各帝國主義者寒心呢。</p>

<p>於是，得意地，她指給我看她所有的一切；放在以塊擱板上的鹽缸，放在牀底下的一隻麥紛箱，放在桌上的一隻小小煤油燈。我從來没有見過一個對於自己的家務比她更得意的主婦。</p>
<p>我繼續與她談着話。她用了一種聰慧的坦白與一個淸切而快樂的聲音回答我所問的問題。</p>
<p>「您怎樣認識您的丈夫的？」我問她。</p>
<p>「呀！這是一件極奇怪的事情，一部真真的小説……起初，人家對我稱讚他，人家對我説一個殘廢者是很適合配我的。接着，他不喝酒，不粗俗，並且還有一個很好的終身的津貼……，我呢，住在一個鄰近的村落裏，我的丈夫在大戰裏死了，我就想：「我該去看看他，或者這是上帝的意願……這樣，您知道，他馬上就愛了我，因為這是一個很誠懇的男人。</p>
<p>他可照着這裏的風俗用了一輛花車來迎您？您的東家可曾用了四隻馬駕的車接您來這裏的？」</p>
<p>「呀！您想！」女人説，「人家頃刻嫉妬我的幸氣，要把他從我手裏奪去。我該告訴您人家説了我許多謡言，説什麽我太喜打扮，不配做一個窮人的老婆。」</p>

<p>— 淸</p>
<p>徳國曾經是一個想做「世界之錘」的國家。在戰前，他有着獨占歐洲以至獨占世界的野心。但自從一九一七年被英法各國所戰敗後這個野心，便被消滅了</p>
<p>從此以後，德國十足做了一個「世界之砧」的國家，為各大國—尤其是法國，所嚴重的敲擊着。</p>
<p>而現在，德國少數的野心家，却又有重做「世界之錘」的野心。據報載，德國勞工管理員波爾格在哥龍尼城向國社黨青年演説，謂：「德國今後將不再為世界之砧，而將為世界之錘」云。這是一個多麽誇大的口氣。</p>
<p>事實上，德國想重做世界之錘，本不自今日始，自從希特勒登台，就更熱熾的煽起了這份野心了。然而，他的結果，是要求軍備平等，以及要求收回薩爾區域等等，都給英法碰了嚴重的回擊。德國没有辦法，他就只有退岀國聯，索性關起門來，索性製造世界之錘。</p>
<p>德國要重做世界之錘，自然，他第一非錘倒他的唯一對象的敵人法國不可，然而，這是英國所似乎不十分允許的，而且，以法國現今的實力，德國也難於有將他錘倒之勢。那末，他的鐵錘子，向那裏去錘呢？這是，是有着廣大的俄國的領土。於是，他的唯一目前可錘的人，就非俄國莫屬了。這是今日的德國所以變成了西歐唯一可以爆發世界大戰的因子。</p>
<p>同樣，在東方的日本，也正在十足甜蜜的要做「世界之錘」的夢。這夢，可説一半給他實現了。現在所成問題的就是俄國這一國。日本的「世界之錘，」怎樣打入俄國的境地呢？這是很可踟蹰的。再則，東岸的美國，也是他一個死對頭。只要這兩個對頭不成問題，他的「世界之錘」之夢，似乎可説十分之八九已完成了。</p>
<p>然而這夢恐怕始終不會完成的。我們看他怎樣在夢中得意又怎樣在夢中失意罷。</p>

<p>— 嫦兒</p>
<p>病後，扶了手杖，獨自兒在公園裏散步。</p>
<p>是冬天，靜悄悄的，小路像被遺棄了的女人似的躺在我面前，兩旁小樹被風吹得刺刺作響，偶然幾片黄葉在我頭頂打了幾個滚飄落到汚泥裏。</p>
<p>抬起頭來，冬天瞧不見天空的濃蔭，僅見幾條瘦弱的樹幹，太陽曬到身上一點没有暖意，這公園也像生了病般的没有生氣。</p>
<p>「同情的人兒來探望你了！」</p>
<p>吹着口哨，在一個空着的鐵沙椅上坐了下來，從大衣掏岀一册詩集來，是我病中一位不署名的朋友從郵局寄來的，封面上寫着兩行淸秀的字跡：</p>
<p>知道你病了，這册詩集送給你作病中的消遣，不要追思送書的人，我們自有會面的機會。</p>
<p>每天隨意翻着，讀完了每一首詩，好像都在什麽地方見過的，但讀到底頁，没有作者的名字及岀版的書局。並不為了那兩行字的暗示，我不去追想那送書的人，實在病中没有那種思慮，讀完後就隨手堆在書架上，後來搬了家，這册詩集也不知塞到那裏去了。今天整理衣服，在一隻破箱底裏發現了它，隨手塞在大夜袋裏。現在重瞧見了這兩行字，却想追尋那個送書的人了。</p>
<p>我注視着地上一羣覓食的麻雀，思潮跟着它們的跳躍不知馳騁到那裏了，突然它們打夥兒飛了，小路的盡頭閃着一個人影。</p>
<p>「又是一個同情的人兒呵！」</p>
<p>想着，瞧着那一雙高跟皮鞋慢慢地從枯黄了的草叢中走過來。我的視綫自她脚尖抬起頭，忙埋頭在衣領中作為看書的樣子，靜聼那脚聲漸漸逼近，脚尖已停留在我的面前了，同時肩頭上被人拍着，假裝突然驚來般的仰起頭。</p>
<p>「消瘦了啊——我還是認識你」</p>
<p>「是的，病了許多時。」</p>
<p>站起身來把詩集塞到大衣袋裏就想走路。</p>
<p>「我知道的，」她扶着我的手杖並肩走路，「我想來探望你，可是你搬了家。」</p>
<p>我望了她一眼，想起那册詩集來，就掏岀來在她面前一揚。</p>
<p>「是你送的？」</p>
<p>點點頭，「這是你喜歡讀的詩。」</p>
<p>「但是第二次已没有第一次那樣有意思了！」</p>
<p>「那或者你不滿意作詩的人？」</p>
<p>「没有這個意思，我滿意每個詩人…詩人是熱情的，是嗎？」</p>
<p>「貧嘴兒！」笑着踢去了路上一塊小磚，「不要牢記着過去的事罷，詩人又像天空的白雲一樣自由了。」</p>
<p>「恭賀你可以岀版第二個詩集！」</p>
<p>「説正經話，可以告訴我你的住址嗎？」</p>
<p>「預備送詩集給我？謝謝，我的書架子已客滿了！」</p>
<p>「好罷，我住在女子公寓，希望我</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>們再有見面的時候！」</p>
<p>目送着她踏着黄葉在路側消逝，抬起頭來，白雲在天空飛奔。</p>
<p>「自由了！」重瞧着封面上兩行淸秀的字跡。</p>
<h3 id="c196">城隍廟與大世界 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 吴式</p>
<p>外國人到中國來觀光，脚踏上上海的陸地，他們所呌得岀的地名是城隍廟與大世界，彷彿這二個所在可以代表整個上海大都市。每個觀光團體到上海來，時常一連串的汽車或黄包車在這兩處地方發見於是許多不盡不實的新聞和照片，帶回國去作不忠實的宣傳，閉門造車的外國作家就以為整個中國是這末一個模樣。這還是在東方第一大都市的上海的話，如果他們深入到文化落後的内地，及封建的小鄉村，那一提起中國，可以把辯子，纏足來代表，以為是並不誇張的。</p>
<p>話一溜就是這末遠，其實城隍廟與大世界在一盤人心目中覺得一如上海有南京路，大光明一樣的不足為奇，每天擁擠着的不是人羣嗎？</p>
<p>小時候每天跟祖父上城隍廟去，在孩提的目光中，或者要比觀光團更勝一籌，賣糖的擔子，各式的玩具，都是認為天下的奇觀，就是在九曲橋上看那些昂頭爬動的烏龜，也是覺得分外高興的。但是祖父一到廟裏，就上茶樓，他從不許我東跑西玩，説要被拐子捉去的，於是從洋欄杆的花紋中作小範圍的俯瞰，也很滿意了。然而城隍廟給我的影像不是這些，實在到是那些賣花生，荳腐干的小擔子。因為這茶樓中的來客，都是祖父的朋友，他們遇見了能够談岀許許多多話來，一談話自然不能分神來管我，恐怕我偷到下面去玩，就犒賞三軍，抓了一桌子的零食，所以城隍廟給我的影像不是好玩，是好吃。現在據説城隍廟還是「吃」字上面佔優勝，從正門起，粟子攤頭，露天大菜，麵館有葷素，各種零食小吃，簡直五步一攤，十步一店，然而要我找岀外國人認為奇特的所在，恐怕就是那些塑像了，不過與「上帝」比較起來，也没有多大的差别。</p>
<p>説到大世界，實在抱歉，要不是今夏的跳水朋友獻技，我是不會和它發生關係的。所以大世界從前是個什麽光景，無從臆造，不過遊戲塲總是個雜要薈集所，而且票要低廉，就是所謂鄉下人至上海來，以及許多店員工人惟一娱樂地，客地人可以看他們的鄉劇，當然是分外親切，京劇，話劇也都有它們的擁䕶者，我費了三小時功夫，作了一次廵禮，除了這裏的羣衆太不守秩序外，也同樣找不岀洋大人們所認為值得特别的地方。曾化了三塊錢看萬花團，忘了是那一幕裏的小丑們滿台打滚，這又與這裏的大溪皇荘中有什麽高下之分？</p>
<p>城隍廟與大世界自有它們存在的價值和歷史，這一點或在就是觀光團所特别注意之點了。</p>
<h3 id="c197">人生話匣 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 戈特</p>
<p>—百感篇—</p>
<p>窮光蛋的眼内這世界無異一座火山，好比一個地獄。</p>
<p>大闊佬的嘴裏這天下是最幸福的，彷彿一個天堂。</p>
<p>只有女人纔懂得真正的悲哀，只有孩子纔不知世間一切的煩擾，只有老頭兒才明白世事真正的難艱。只有宗教家纔透澈女人的神秘，只有革命家才了解世界的命運。</p>
<p>人生在得意時是有意義的，在失意時是無味的。</p>
<p>怕生活的人被生活所窘，愛生活的人被生活所困，不懂得生活的人被生活所害，懂生活的人被生活所愛。</p>
<p>戴色眼鏡的人看到的萬象都是有色的。反之，往往又被有色的世界所眩惑。</p>
<p>我想將世界揑在我自己的一隻掌中。但世界却把我揉在牠的腋下。</p>
<p>我想把天下所有的女人都作我的奴隸，而我却被天下的女人當我做她們的奴隸。</p>
<p>我想倘人不是為生活的話，人是不會互相争鬥的。</p>
<p>你不會自私，我不會自利，他不會自愛，那人人都會幸福的。</p>
<p>我想洋大人的腦袋是機械做的，女人的嘴吧是蜜糖製的，中國人的心是豆腐型的，軍人的脚是鐵鑄的，軍閥的手是蟹爪的。</p>
<p>愛我的人我是恨他的。恨我的人我是愛他的。</p>
<p>没修養者愛囂閙，有學問者好緘默。</p>
<p>氣量狹的人終生不會岀頭的。</p>
<p>鬥争為一切事業成功之動力。</p>
<p>有堅毅的意志者不會失敗的；因為失敗過了並不會灰心。</p>
<p>最愚蠢的人是最幸福的人。</p>
<p>没有一個人不會説謊的，也没有一個人一生都是説謊的。</p>
<p>好冷笑的人是好猾黠人。好猾黠的人便是好損人的人。</p>
<p>用熱誠待人的常被不熱誠的人所欺。</p>
<p>人是萬物之靈，也是萬物的罪魁，因為人只為着人的。</p>

<p>— 大葉</p>
<p>小丫頭香香立在門角落里望着太太。</p>
<p>太太，在梳妝台前，抹粉，畫眉，搽眼圏，塗胭脂，點口紅，四七一一從頭洒到脚。</p>
<p>對着鏡子，太太化裝了好久的臉，做着從電影上學來的表情：微笑，嬌嗔。</p>
<p>鏡子裏的大眸子飄到立在旁邊的少年，少年笑了，侍候過久有些不耐煩的笑。</p>
<p>「好了嗎？够漂亮哪！」</p>
<p>「好啦，别急。」</p>
<p>格格的笑着立起來的太太，側過身來望望自己的背影，然後，到衣架上把大衣拿了來，少年殷勤地走上去給她穿上了。</p>
<p>挽住了胳膊，太太向獨自坐在桌畔呷着啤酒的老爺在嘴唇邊送去一個抛吻，接着嬌滴滴一聲「各罷！」就扭着屁股岀去了。</p>
<p>香香注意了一下老爺在太太走後的神情，却並没有怒，怪自得地呷着酒。</p>
<p>突然，老爺拉起了喉嚨喊：「香香！」</p>
<p>照例，香香聽到這一聲呼喚後，就把做好了的牛奶咖啡端了上去。</p>
<p>老爺向來在太太背後對她的笑臉對她眯緊眼皮笑：「香香，你每天做菜，真是太辛苦了，使我覺得很不忍的。」</p>
<p>很拘束的：「没有什麽辛苦，賺老爺的錢做做菜是應該的」。</p>
<p>這時，老爺忽拿岀五元錢來，説：「你很勤，我現在先把下月的工錢付給你。」</p>
<p>「謝謝老爺。」</p>
<p>不提防老爺伸過手去把她拉到身邊，説是有話對她説，便在她的耳邊咭噥了好一回。她紅着臉祗是摇着頭，把手挣脱了。</p>
<p>老爺仍嘻開嘴對她説：「你這姑娘怎麽這樣儍，老爺看得你起才抬舉你的。老實説，太太現在多闊，多寫意，但她先前還不是同你一樣，她嫁了我，我時常帶她到外面去交際交際，這樣就闊起來了，現在還有誰看得她是女傭。你該想想啊！」</p>
<p>香香不作聲。老爺扮着鬼臉走到她身旁：「你答應我，我一定把太太掉了那時，你還不够享受嗎？」</p>
<p>想着家，想着自己，想着老爺的話，想着答應了老爺這一些時他不是會像掉太太一樣掉棄自己嗎？她害怕得渾身發抖了。</p>
<p>香香戰競地説：「老爺，我不能，我不能……」</p>
<p>「你該想想，做一輩子傭人是不會岀頭的。你答應了我，還用得着愁吃的，愁穿的嗎？」</p>
<p>香香摇摇頭。</p>
<p>老爺有些光火了：「你再這樣不識抬舉，别讓我怒了。説哪，願意不願意。」</p>
<p>仍摇摇頭。</p>
<p>老爺嗾的立起來，走過去惡狠狠地從香香的手裏奪下鈔票。</p>
<p>「你給我滚！」</p>
<p>「什麽滚？」</p>
<p>香香呆往了？</p>

<p>— 阿炯</p>
<p>傍午時分，雲兒飄在天空，朶朶的湧現岀一陣烏黑，大地上濛着一層薄薄的霧。像是秋已深了的景象，細雨不息地落着，隨着霧的成分，漸漸地更覺得濃烈起來，就在這樣一個情景中，我委身於龐大的輪船上，離開了我的Ｆ，到了上海。</p>
<p>因為Ｆ在碼頭等我，而且離輪船開駛的時間也很逼，於是我帶着一顆像我第一次離家時一樣悲慘的心，冒着雨從家裏岀來，街上的景物，還是像往日一樣：人影熙來攘往，汽車如穿梭，電車依然開足馬力，宛如長蛇般的拖動着前駛，秋風吹動着地上的落葉，秋雨仍是濛濛地下着，好像是梅雨那麽的使人感到不快，我悵惘地隨着車輪的旋轉，到了黄浦灘碼頭，我就和跟Ｆ着擔行李的碼頭工人登上輪船。</p>
<p>望着茫茫的大海，盡都是一望無涯，究竟將這扁舟載向何處去？我背着一身負重的包袱，難道這包袱將要經過幾番的風浪狂打，不會沉諸海底麽？我開始疑懼起來，心兒顫動的難以制止。Ｆ緊握着我的手，在我們間似乎都有難言的苦痛，當這别離將要來到的霎時間。生活的鞭策，是多麽地厲害啊！為了求存，使我不得不和Ｆ分離，獨自一個人飄流到陌生的南國去。</p>
<p>在汽笛鳴鳴的聲中，Ｆ就從甲板上站到碼頭上去了。鑼聲嚮了，船身似乎開始在轉動，我的心喲！簡直是酸楚的難以言狀！不知麽的，一陣别時容易見時難的悽感，從我的心坎深處像潮般的湧起，我絲毫也没有制止的力量，我終於哭了！</p>
<p>輪船開駛了，在秋風蕭瑟中，在細雨濛濛中，站在碼頭上的的影子終於小得看不淸楚了。我悽然地對着海空説了一聲：别了，别了，上海！</p>

<p>——Liu Xiang Visits Chiang to Request Instructions——</p>
<p>Liu Discusses the Situation of Bandit Suppression and Construction Projects in Sichuan Province</p>
<p>Future Actions Will Be Carried Out in Accordance with the Central Government's Directives</p>
<p>Various Personnel Flock to Nanjing to Meet with Chiang</p>
<p>[Nanjing] This morning, the 23rd, Liu Xiang answered questions from Sichuanese legislators such as Li Zhonggong; at 10 AM, he met with the Minister of Military Affairs, He Yingqin, and then, accompanied by He, went to the Military Council to meet with Chairman Chiang. At noon, he attended a welcoming banquet hosted by President Sun [Ke], and in the evening, he attended a welcoming banquet hosted by the Minister of Communications. According to Liu's representative, Fu Zhenwu, after Liu met with Chairman Chiang, regarding the military affairs of bandit suppression in Sichuan Province, he requested instructions, and a substantial decision has been made in general. He will stay in Nanjing for about three or four more days and then leave Nanjing to return to Sichuan. Furthermore, Chairman Lin [Sen] presented Liu with a banquet on the 23rd, dispatched by personnel from the Military Affairs Office to his residence. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Liu Xiang told people that any reforms of military affairs in Sichuan Province were out of the question. As the Communist bandits became increasingly rampant, the situation worsened. If we want to talk about the principles of governing Sichuan, unless there is a comprehensive plan for military affairs, there is no way to improve politics. I have met with both Chiang and Wang [Jingwei] many times in recent days. In terms of military affairs, considering the existing strength in Sichuan, we are jointly responsible for suppressing the bandits, but I really feel it is insufficient. The central government has agreed to provide supplements, with the common goal of eliminating the bandit scourge. As for political matters, we will first reorganize the provincial government and strive to reform provincial administration. The situation in Sichuan Province is different from other provinces. The bandits benefit from defense but not offense, while the government should attack rather than defend. If we allow the situation to persist for a long time, it will be even more difficult to suppress them in the future. The most urgent matters are the reorganization of finances, the development of transportation, and the elimination of weak and preservation of strong troops. I advocate the construction of railways, whose importance far outweighs that of highways. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The General Commander of the 20th Route Army, Zhang Fang, in order to report to Chairman Chiang on the army's bandit suppression situation in Fujian, has departed from Fujian and arrived in Shanghai. He is scheduled to come to Nanjing on the morning of the 24th. The army's office in Nanjing has booked a room for Zhang at the Central Hotel. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Wang Zhengting arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 23rd to attend the National Government Committee meeting and the Jinling University Board of Trustees meeting, and to meet with Chairman Chiang. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ambassador to Soviet Russia, Yan Huiqing, visited President Wang [Jingwei] on the morning of the 23rd and Chairman Chiang in the afternoon. He is scheduled to travel to Shanghai today or tomorrow. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Liu Xiang has been consulting with the central government on the issue of bandit suppression in Sichuan and has also been meeting with friends and attending banquets, so he has been very busy. He felt a slight discomfort in his stomach, so on the 23rd, he specially invited a famous doctor from Shanghai to examine his body. In the afternoon of the 23rd, he had a long conversation with Yang Jie and also met with reporters. He said that the central authorities intend to reorganize the Sichuan Provincial Government to improve administration. As for the overall plan for suppressing bandits in Sichuan, it will be done in accordance with the central government's overall plan, and efforts will be made to supplement and reorganize the bandit suppression armies to pacify the bandit scourge as soon as possible. In short, Sichuan is the Sichuan of the central government, and everything is subject to the central government's orders. He also said that after the bandit suppression is completed, the primary task of Sichuan's construction is to build railways and highways. Finally, he said that on this trip out of Sichuan, he passed through the provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei, and he was deeply moved by the rapid progress of construction. However, if production and construction were implemented in Sichuan, the value gained would be even more astonishing. He warmly welcomes financial circles from all over to engage in the development of Sichuan's rich resources. After arriving in Nanjing, he saw Chairman Chiang and the central government leaders burying their heads in hard work and was extremely admiring. He also encountered the capital's air defense exercise, and the spirit of the participating soldiers and civilians was excellent, which was commendable. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After Mao Weisui reported on defense affairs to Chairman Chiang in Jiangxi, he immediately left Jiangxi and arrived in Nanjing at noon on the 23rd aboard the Datong steamer. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Sun Ke hosted a luncheon banquet for Liu Xiang, He Chengjun, He Yingqin, Shi Qingyang, Zeng Kuangqing, and Liu's representatives Fu Zhenwu and Deng Mingjie on the 23rd at noon, and also invited members of the [Legislative] Yuan, such as Ma Yinchu and Li Zhonggong, to accompany them. The guests and hosts toasted and then dispersed. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After Chairman Chiang returned triumphantly to Nanjing, dignitaries from various places came to Nanjing to pay their respects. It is reported that Yu Youren, Liu Xiang, Xia Douyin, and others went to the officer's residence at the military academy to meet with Chiang and discuss matters.

(Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Nanchang] Chiang believes that the bandits in Jiangxi are about to be wiped out, and the remaining bandits are gathered in a corner of Huichang. Capturing and beheading the bandit leaders is particularly important.

<p>[Nanjing] The Criminal Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan submitted a report to the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan regarding the amendment of the Criminal Procedure Law: Regarding the submission of the report, Kejuan and others were ordered by the Yuan to amend the Criminal Procedure Law. At the time, the Criminal Law was being amended and could not be carried out at the same time. Later, the 25th Yuan meeting resolved to refer the Criminal Procedure Law Draft amended by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to this committee for review. Following the order, it was carefully reviewed starting on December 20 of last year. The draft was carefully studied, and opinions from various parties and the results of this examination were taken into consideration to carry out the amendments. Until September 20 of this year, the first draft of the amendment was completed. Then, starting on October 3, it was organized and completed on November 10 as the Criminal Procedure Law Amendment, totaling nine volumes, twenty chapters, and 526 articles. A total of 67 meetings were held. As for the guiding principles of this amendment, in addition to changing the four-level, three-instance system to a three-level, three-instance system in accordance with the Court Organization Law, and following the principle of expanding the scope of private prosecution established by the Central Political Council, efforts were made to simplify procedures, expedite case closures, reduce litigation burdens, and prevent abuses. The Provisional Regulations on Criminal Simplified Procedures Draft and the Criminal Penalty Enforcement Law Draft, which were successively sent to the Yuan by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, have also been considered and adopted. All the circumstances of the amendment of the Criminal Procedure Law are hereby reported for review, and the Criminal Procedure Law Amendment and the main points of the amendment are respectfully submitted for consideration by the general assembly. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 23rd, the 16th Article Tax Rate Table of the Stamp Tax Law Draft was amended and passed as follows: For invoices, receipts for silver, money, and goods, and bills, the stamp duty is one cent for each item with a stated price or amount of three yuan or more, two cents for ten yuan or more, and three cents for one hundred yuan or more. The person responsible for affixing the stamps is the maker. Also, in Chapter 3 Penalties, Article 18, a clause was added: "When the amount of tax payable as calculated by the multiple mentioned in the preceding paragraph is less than three yuan, a fine of three yuan shall be imposed," so that when the fine imposed by the multiple of the tax amount is less than three yuan, it should be fined three yuan. Furthermore, the so-called "If there are two or more cases, the penalty should still be imposed on a per-case basis, and the concurrent penalty method does not apply" in the case of the Ministry of Finance's application to amend the penalty provisions is inconsistent with the tenth clause of the Stamp Tax Law principle, so the original case is maintained to conform to the principle. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 23rd, Liu Kejuan reported on the main points of amending the Criminal Procedure Law, totaling 52 points. The most important points are summarized as follows: 1. Since the Court Organization Law adopts a three-level, three-instance system, this case stipulates that all criminal cases, except for the crime of internal rebellion and the crime of endangering foreign relations, which are under the jurisdiction of the High Court for the first instance, all other cases are under the jurisdiction of the District Court for the first instance; 2. In the chapter on the detention of the defendant, this case has been added, deleted, and modified: A. The current law has no explicit restrictions on the extension of detention during the trial. This case stipulates that for minor crimes, it is limited to three times; B. If the case is appealed and the defendant's detention period exceeds the sentence of the original trial, unless the prosecutor appeals to the disadvantage of the defendant, the detention should be revoked and the defendant released; C. The circumstances in which the application for suspension of detention may not be rejected are currently limited to cases where the most severe penalty for the crime is detention or a fine. This case expands it to imprisonment of six months or less and adds the circumstances where pregnant women, women in childbirth, and seriously ill people should have their detention suspended; D. The application for suspension of detention is revised to be based on the presentation of a bond as a principle, and the payment of a deposit is an exception; E. The circumstances of confiscation of the deposit are revised to be limited to cases where the defendant flees; F. A new article is added: "Even if there is a situation where detention should be ordered, detention may still not be ordered, and the person may be ordered to provide a bond or surety"; G. The prosecutor should inspect the place of detention of the defendant at any time; 3. According to the current law, victims can bring private prosecutions only for crimes that directly infringe on individual legal interests and crimes that are subject to prosecution, which are under the jurisdiction of graded courts. This case changes it to allow victims of crimes who have the capacity to act to file private prosecutions, in accordance with the principles established by the Central Political Council, in order to expand the scope of private prosecutions; 4. According to the current law, cases that can be applied to simplified procedures are limited to those with a maximum penalty of imprisonment of six months or less, detention, or a fine. This case changes it to allow all cases that cannot be appealed to the third instance to be punished by order in accordance with simplified procedures, but the penalty imposed is limited to imprisonment of six months or less, detention, or a fine.

It has been connected with the Shanghai banking community, and the funds are being allocated for use.

In the future, the provincial government is reorganizing road security and has ordered the Department of Construction to work with the Highway Bureau to draft appropriate measures. Lu has been physically weak in recent years and has long intended to resign. However, due to repeated requests from the central government to stay, he has had to reluctantly continue.

<p>[Nanjing] Nicaraguan Vice President Espinoza, accompanied by Secretary Nelson and Honorary Consul of that country in Shanghai, Kan Ronggao, and escorted by Lin Tongshi, Section Chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Beijing on the 22nd at 11:00 PM via the Beijing-Shanghai night express train with an attached special carriage. They arrived at Xiaguan Station at 7:00 AM on the 23rd. Upon learning of Mr. Espinoza's arrival in Beijing, the capital's police and military authorities, in addition to dispatching police and military personnel to the station for care, also sent a military band and a police and military detachment to stand at the platform to welcome him. The National Government dispatched Liu Naifan, Section Chief of the Bureau of Ceremonies; Qu Chang, Deputy Section Chief of the Department of Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Secretaries Wang Zuanzu and Liao Chengliu; Chen Ming, the newly appointed Consul-General to Managua, the capital of Nicaragua; and Wang Zhiyi, Chief of the Secretariat of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, to welcome them at the station. As the train pulled into the station, the military band played a grand welcome tune. The welcoming party boarded the train one after another, and Lin Tongshi introduced them to Mr. Espinoza individually. Mr. Espinoza, dressed in civilian clothes, was about sixty years old, with white hair and a silver beard, and in good spirits. He shook hands with each member, expressing his thanks with an amiable attitude. After a brief exchange of greetings, they disembarked from the train together. As the military music resounded, they slowly walked out of the station. The two teams of military police and police who welcomed them at the station saluted as Mr. Espinoza passed by, and Mr. Espinoza also frequently doffed his hat and nodded in return. After leaving the station, Mr. Espinoza immediately boarded a car prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accompanied by Liu Naifan, and went to the Yangtze River Hotel for a rest. His entourage was received by Liao Chengliu, a secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and taken by car to the Yangtze River Hotel. At 10:00 AM, Mr. Espinoza, accompanied by Kan Ronggao and Nelson, and escorted by Lin Tongshi, took a car from the Yangtze River Hotel to visit Dean Wang's deputy Xu Mo and the section chiefs at Official Residence No. 1 of the Ministry of Railways.

<h3 id="e14">The Prospect of Provincial and Municipal Boundary Demarcation Appears Quite Bleak <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The Two Sides Have Not Approached Agreement</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Announces Reasons for Maintaining Current Boundaries</p>
<p>[Beiping] Regarding the issue of provincial and municipal boundary demarcation, the opinions of the province and the city have not yet approached each other. The Hebei Provincial Government believes that the previous provincial and municipal boundaries have long been equivalent to being demarcated. This demarcation matter is only a formal procedure for erecting boundary markers. At the same time, it also announced six reasons for maintaining the current provincial and municipal boundaries. Therefore, general observation is that the prospect of this issue has suddenly become bleak. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] On the 22nd, the Hebei Provincial Government dispatched Fu Weiji, Secretary-General of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Huang Zengyuan, Secretary-General of the Department of Industry, to Beiping to negotiate and survey the provincial and municipal boundaries, and then decide on the demarcation. The Beiping Municipal Government believes that this matter has been approved by the Ministry of the Interior, the boundaries have been set, and there is no need for further survey. Fu and Huang returned to Tianjin this morning to report. Yu Xuezhong said that the expansion of the Beiping municipal area, its draft and plan, were not contacted with the province in advance. He only received a message from other sources a few days before the matter was discovered, knowing that Beiping had this plan. According to the current map of Beiping, it reaches the border wall to the north, close to the Chahar border, including the territory of Miyun County, 260 li away from Beiping, and reaches the territory of Gu'an County to the south, more than 100 li away. The total area of the city has expanded to ten thousand square li, which is inevitably too vast. The province does not object to this, but another plan and map have been submitted for the Ministry of the Interior to study, because if the city area is expanded, the province will also feel some inconvenience in foreign affairs. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Regarding the issue of the division of the city by Hebei and Beiping provinces, since Yuan Liang published his speech on the reasons for expanding the urban area, the Hebei Provincial Government has drafted another draft, believing that the newly divided urban area is vast, reaching Tong County in the east, Chabei in the west, Gu'an in the south, and the Great Wall in the north. It advocates that the Beiping urban area should still be divided according to the provisional area, and no longer expanded. It raised objections to Beiping's new plan and listed reasons, and submitted them to representatives of Hebei, Beiping, and the Interior for joint discussion.

<h3 id="e22">Statistics on Drug Trafficking Cases Cracked in the Past Nine Months <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>U.S. Representative Reports at the Opium Advisory Committee</p>
<p>Hu Shize Asks to Pay Attention to China's Smoke Prohibition Situation</p>
<p>[Geneva] At today's meeting of the Opium Advisory Committee, U.S. representative Fuller presented a report with statistics on private drug smuggling cases cracked in the first nine months of this year. During those nine months, cases of private smuggling of raw opium were cracked in China, the United States, Hong Kong, Macau, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, Iraq, Egypt, Turkey, France, England, the Netherlands, and other countries. The largest case of private drug smuggling was cracked in New York on June 16, with 183 kilograms of drugs seized. The batch of drugs was transported from Marseille by a Norwegian wheel, passing through Spain and Portugal to the United States. The next largest case was cracked in Marseille on May 8, with 52 kilograms of raw opium seized. This opium was transported from the Far East, Turkey, Egypt, and other places. In addition, more than 11 and a half kilograms of raw opium were cracked in Rotterdam on September 18. The sources of the cracked cases in Europe and the United States have not been determined. Those cracked in the Far East included opium from Turkey, Persia, and China. In addition, there were those coming from Siberia. The Persian opium cracked in the Far East had special marks and similar marks. Most of the private drug trafficking marks were used. Opium was also cracked twice in Trinidad, Spain. According to the smugglers, the opium was smuggled from British India to Europe. The smuggling of cooked opium was mostly in Hong Kong, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, the Philippines, and the United States. It was also cracked in England, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Most of the seals and marks were Chinese, and it seems that they were loaded and exported from the coastal ports of China. The largest amount of morphine cracked was in the Far East and the United States. There were only two cases in Poland and three in Turkey in Europe. The United States cracked 19 cases, with a total of 6 kilograms of morphine. China had 7 cases, Hong Kong had 1 case, and Siam had the most with 94 cases. In the Far East and the United States, there have been constant cracking of morphine manufacturing organizations. Heroin smuggling cases in the nine months included one case each in the United States, Canada, and Hong Kong, and eight cases in China. One of the cases cracked in Hong Kong had 128 kilograms. The investigation is still in progress. It is said that the heroin in Hong Kong was transported from Guangzhou and it is believed that it was manufactured in South China. However, another report stated that it was manufactured in Japan. There were also reports of crackdowns in Canada, the United States, the Philippines, China, the South Seas Islands, India, Austria, France, Italy, Greece, Poland, and Uruguay. A large amount of cocaine, up to 21 kilograms, was cracked in Shanghai. It is said that the drugs were found on a Japanese ship and were manufactured in Japan. Fuller's report has been passed by the committee. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] Hu Shize, the Chinese envoy to Switzerland, delivered an article to the League of Nations' Opium Committee today, asking it to pay attention to the new laws and regulations recently implemented in China to ban the buying and selling of opium. Hu said that the problem is more serious in China because the regulations governing the buying and selling of opium are more strictly enforced in China than in the West, and the events in the Far East have prevented China from giving the matter all the necessary attention. This is also the reason why the opium problem is becoming more serious. The anti-drug movement in China cannot be limited to unilateral actions by China. China needs the cooperation of the powers in China that have concessions and settlements, because foreigners in the concessions and settlements who sell drugs are punished too lightly.

The Judicial Yuan has interpreted that the ownership of graves and the ownership of land are originally not inseparable. Although the owner of the land may transfer his land to others, he may not infringe on the rights of the owner of the grave as a result. As for the legal disposition of the administrative agency to order the relocation of graves for public interest, the owner of the grave cannot resist it. However, if the order of the agency has not yet made a specific disposition for the grave or determined the relocation date, the owner of the grave may still assert his right to the grave against others.

<h3 id="e31">The Future of Indian Self-Government <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>India, known as an ancient civilization of the world, has been under the control of the British for more than 300 years. Even the history of its direct rule by the British government is nearly 80 years. The British regard India as nothing more than a private possession. However, due to the vigorous self-determination movement in recent years, they have not hesitated to make false concessions and gradually changed from a high-pressure policy to a policy of appeasement. However, their desire to permanently control it has never changed.</p>
<p>What the Indian people demand is independence and autonomy, or at least the rights that a self-governing colony should enjoy. However, the British are only willing to discuss the revision of the current Indian constitution, formally replacing centralization with a federal system. Nothing else is their concern. Since 1930, the British have convened round table conferences on constitutional issues three times. Their purpose is nothing more than to use the beautiful name of "self-government" to eliminate the proposal of "complete independence" passed by the Indian National Congress in Lahore in 1919.</p>
<p>After the Third Round Table Conference, the British government issued a White Paper describing the proposals for revising the Indian Constitution. The main points were that the executive power of the Indian Federation would be in the hands of the Governor-General, who would restrain and manage the affairs of the ministries of national defense, foreign affairs, and religion. The Legislative Council may not pass any laws that would restrict or discriminate against the exercise of certain franchised rights by British or British companies. The true face of the British government was even more exposed at this point. It is appropriate that there were widespread repercussions and proposals for revision. Now, looking at the recently published report on Indian constitutional reform, the power of the Governor-General is still very extensive, and the special status of the British in India is explicitly guaranteed. With such regulations, not only is the reality of complete autonomy far away, but it is also a dream to be equal to self-governing colonies such as Canada. It is in order for the Indians to riot and resist.</p>
<p>However, we must silently observe the internal affairs of India and realize that the Indians themselves also have their own faults. The independence movement is to seek political freedom and national liberation, and the spirit of political democracy must be based on the spirit of social democracy. However, the intensity of religious and ethnic conflicts in India and the depth of class concepts are rare in the world. How can the British not take advantage of this weakness to manipulate them in the middle, so that 300 million Indians will never be free. For example, the Indian National Congress was originally a tool for all Indians to seek the benefits of independence. However, the most powerful Hindus and Muslims in the Indian nation have different dreams in the same bed and have always adhered to their prejudices and refused to cooperate sincerely. As a result, the National Congress, which bears a major mission, cannot exert its due power. For so many years, although important domestic leaders such as Gandhi and Madam Nehru have been running around mediating and repeatedly persuading, the results have been minimal, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Now, let us take a step back and say that the newly published constitutional outline has exhausted the ability of fairness and generosity. However, the infighting between the Hindu and Muslim religions will still make the election of key members of the whole case have no satisfactory solution. Looking at past experience, the claims of the Hindu and Muslim religions will immediately conflict as soon as the election is mentioned. The reason is that the number of Hindus is more than 240 million, accounting for about three-quarters of the total population. The number of Muslims is more than 68 million, accounting for about one-fifth of the total population. The Hindus rely on their large number of people and advocate that the production of members should be elected by the "joint election system," that is, all ethnic voters are gathered in one place, and those with the most votes are elected. Muslims advocate the "separate election system," that is, each ethnic group separately elects a certain number of members to organize the parliament. (However, in the two provinces of Bengal and Punjab, where the number of this religion is uniquely large, they also advocate joint elections.) In addition, they also require that any proposal in the legislature must be approved and implemented by two-thirds of all Muslim representatives, otherwise it will be completely invalid. Both sides insist on their own opinions and refuse to give in. Now it is heard that the constitutional report stipulates that each minority has seats in the parliament of the federation and provinces. However, whether it can be smoothly allocated in fact is still a big question. If this is not resolved, any constitutional reform cannot be discussed. If the British have the sincerity to help India's self-government, why not add to it?</p>
<p>About a month ago, the All-India Congress met in Mumbai. The chairman severely criticized the British White Paper policy in his opening remarks. He concluded by saying, "We are fighting barehanded with the weapons of morality against a government equipped with the latest destructive machinery to fight for justice. God will bless us." His words are extremely painful. However, while Indians hope for God's blessing, we especially hope that Indians can help themselves.</p>

<p>Southern Kingdom Officially Accuses League of Nations</p>
<p>Request to Include in Next Agenda for Discussion</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Yugoslav government's application to the League of Nations regarding the issue of political responsibility for the assassination in Marseille has been submitted by the country's Foreign Minister, Yevtic, to the Secretariat of the League of Nations. The application states that the Marseille assassination is of great importance and enough to disrupt relations between the Southern Kingdom and Hungary, because some terrorists are sheltered by Hungary and receive assistance from certain government offices. The application then states that the Southern Kingdom has directly negotiated with Hungary regarding the activities of terrorist parties, and a compromise was reached in the Southern Kingdom's capital in July of this year. Hungary agreed to prohibit them, but according to recent investigations, terrorist parties are still sheltered by Hungary. Therefore, the murder of King Alexander and French Foreign Minister Barthou was committed by these people, and the prior arrangements were also carried out in Hungary. Furthermore, an investigation revealed that some of the accomplices in the Marseille case had previously committed crimes and were accused by Yugoslavia to Hungary. According to their confessions, it is evident that they were not only sheltered by Hungary, but also lived in groups within Hungary, until just before the Marseille incident occurred. Yugoslavia also intends to submit a number of documents as proof of the events listed in the application. The Southern Kingdom government requests that this case be included in the agenda of the League of Nations so that it can be discussed at the next Executive Council meeting. (According to reports, in mid-May of this year, the Hungarian government submitted an application to the League of Nations regarding an incident that occurred on the Hungarian-Southern border. After the Southern Kingdom also submitted a memorandum, the Executive Council intended to discuss the matter, but the two countries, South and Hungary, suddenly had the intention of direct negotiations, so it was abandoned. The compromise reached in the Southern Kingdom's capital in July mentioned in this telegram is probably the result of direct negotiations between the two countries.) (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>

Their contents were the same, stating briefly that the two governments believe that the political responsibility for the Marseille case is sufficient to disrupt the relations between the countries and Hungary, so the two governments express their sympathy for the application submitted by the Southern Kingdom to the League of Nations. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Clearly Political Purpose</p>
<p>Hungary Expresses Protest</p>
<p>Budapest - Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös issued a statement to the semi-official news agency, expressing a serious protest against the actions of the Yugoslav government, and explaining in detail the views of his government on this issue, saying that this behavior is detrimental to the peace of Europe. The Hungarian Prime Minister claimed that the Hungarian government was not surprised by the documents in this Marseille incident, but regarded it merely as a further step in newspaper propaganda. This propaganda has been commonplace for several months, with the aim of damaging Hungary's position. However, the tone of this document is the same as what is published in the newspapers, which is strange. The Hungarian government will ask the world to pay attention to the political role of the Yugoslav documents. Hungary has been established for nearly a thousand years, and its history has never condoned such political assassinations. Therefore, in the capacity of a representative of Hungary, it lodges a serious protest against the Yugoslav documents and denies all fabricated accusations. (National News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hungarian Representative to the League of Nations, Adachi, immediately responded to this challenge, stating that he very much wanted to have the opportunity to debate the Marseille incident in the League of Nations Executive Council. Adachi also said, "I am absolutely opposed to this kind of strategy. I think this is no different from international terrorism." The so-called strategy refers to the accusation of the Southern Kingdom. (National News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Great Shock in Geneva</p>
<p>France Faces Dilemma</p>
<p>[Geneva] According to political observers, the application from the Southern Kingdom to the League of Nations, which strongly accuses Hungary, has caused quite a stir here. France and the Little Entente countries also find themselves in a dilemma, because a few days ago, French Foreign Minister Laval had consulted with representatives of the Little Entente repeatedly, but unexpectedly, the result was like this. All parties speculate that the Southern Kingdom will submit concrete evidence to support its application. According to the Southern Kingdom, these documents will soon be made public to prove that it is not a false accusation. Although the application is only against Hungary, under the observation of all parties, it will further cause disputes between the Southern Kingdom and Italy. In this case, the recent compromise movement between Italy, France, and the Little Entente countries will inevitably be hit. In particular, the application from the Southern Kingdom will not be submitted to the Executive Council of the League of Nations for discussion until January next year.

<p>[London] The Daily Mail reported, "According to reliable sources, Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met in Rome, and the real purpose was not to seek economic rapprochement, but to conclude a military agreement." The newspaper also said, "High-ranking positions in the Austrian Foreign Ministry are still occupied by Nazi spies. According to these people, the Austrian-Italian military agreement was agreed upon orally by the two Prime Ministers without using written clauses. Its content is predetermined for four situations, namely (1) Germany attacks Austria, (2) The Austrian Nazi Party stages a coup, (3) The Czech Republic and Yugoslavia are at war, or want to pass through Austria to fight, (4) A revolt of the Austrian working class. The Italian army, in one of these four situations, will be allowed to enter Austrian territory with Austria's permission to provide assistance." (Havas News Agency, 23rd)</p>

<p>Three Points for Britain to Consider</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Simon made a speech in the House of Commons today, saying that regarding the issue of state monopoly on arms manufacturing, preparations are underway to conduct an investigation. Simon said that regarding this matter, the government's intentions in Geneva are roughly three-fold: (1) Effective supervision of arms, and a ban on state subsidies to arms merchants and the granting of loans to facilitate exports; (2) All countries should apply licensing methods to arms manufacturing for the purpose of supervision; (3) The state of arms manufacturing must be made public, but should not hinder national security. Simon concluded that regarding the state monopoly on arms sales, it seemed to be a partial concession to the opposition Liberal Party and Labour Party. He said, "The government is of course opposed to investigating the situation of arms sales and lightly listening to all kinds of rumors, so as to involve foreign affairs, but if we seriously study the issue of state monopoly on arms sales in terms of national security, then the situation is completely different." Simon then explained what procedures should be adopted if such an investigation is conducted. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<p>Both Sides Believe There is an Urgent Need to Complete It</p>
<p>French Reply to Poland May Be Sent Out Within Days</p>
<p>[Paris] The talks between Laval and Litvinov in Geneva are the most important topic of discussion in the newspapers here today. According to newspaper reports, the French diplomatic authorities in Geneva have notified the newspapers that the main item in the talks between Laval and Litvinov was the Eastern European Locarno Pact. Litvinov has stated to Laval that this pact urgently needs to be completed, and Laval has also promised to send France's reply to Poland in the near future. Le Matin in Paris said that Laval's negotiations are extremely cautious because, on the one hand, France is willing to cooperate with Soviet Russia, and on the other hand, it does not want to increase France's responsibilities. The newspaper is quite skeptical of Litvinov's addition of pressure and his repeated threats of understanding with Germany. Litvinov has stated that if France does not accept Soviet Russia's proposal, Soviet Russia will reach an understanding with Germany. In addition, the famous essayist Soulewijn commented in the evening newspaper that, in any case, there is nothing unsatisfactory about the talks between Laval and Litvinov, and Litvinov has suspected the sincerity of the successor since the death of the former Foreign Minister Barthou, but this suspicion has now been cleared up. (National News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Paris] Diplomatic circles here say that the rumor that France is about to send a reply to Poland on the Eastern European Locarno Pact issue does not seem to have reached a mature stage, because this matter will only proceed after Foreign Minister Laval has agreed with Polish Foreign Minister Beck in Geneva. French officials have not commented on this statement. (National News Agency, 23rd)</p>

<p>[London] Rumors from abroad said that revolutions have occurred in the two cities of Hamburg and Berlin in Germany. Although this statement has been denied, internal unrest seems to have been lurking in Germany. Regarding this matter, the Daily Mail reported that it had recently received news from private sources in London that the political situation in Germany might be about to undergo a sudden change, because the German "Leader and Prime Minister, Hitler, has failed to fulfill the promises he made before, so that the German people feel deceived, and the speed of their awakening is something that no one expected."

<p>Astonishing Announcement by the Chairman of the French Army Committee</p>
<p>German Military Preparations Threaten European Peace</p>
<p>[Paris] Colonel Fabry, Chairman of the Army Committee, announced to the House of Commons today that "Soviet Russia has clearly vowed to us that if France is in trouble, they will send their elite troops to support us." This statement was greeted with thunderous applause. Recently, all French people have been uneasy after hearing that Germany can mobilize 5 million people to the front in the shortest possible time. Colonel Fabry's statement at this time seems even more significant. It has long been a question of public debate what position the Soviet Russian government will take if France and Germany go to war. Even the French General Staff is asking itself. Colonel Fabry's statement can be regarded as the French and Russian governments having reached a complete understanding. (23rd)</p>
<p>[Paris] During the subsequent debate on the land budget in the House of Commons, Achard made a surprising announcement, saying that Russia has a strong and sharp army and is willing to use it to help France in the Franco-German war. Finance Minister 馬旦 quoted the words of former Army Chief and Commander-in-Chief Pétain to support the request to allocate an additional 800 million francs to fund the army's innovation. Achard strongly advocated that France and Russia should conclude an agreement. He believed that the Soviet air force is now the best in the world, followed by France. Achard also said that Germany has built five new bridges on the Rhine, and the number of German automobile roads to the Rhine is now increasing daily. Other speakers mentioned the weakness of the French army and the strength of the German army. (Reuters News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Paris] Achard, the reporter on the French army's expenditures, spoke in the House of Representatives today, criticizing German leader Hitler, saying that those who believe that Hitler will fulfill the Treaty of Versailles are harming peace. Hitler intends to instigate Poland and Japan to jointly resist Soviet Russia, but only the Franco-Russian alliance can lay the foundation for peace. In view of the foreign situation and the possibility of the failure of the Disarmament Conference, the French government has decided to reorganize its military. Colonel Fabry, Chairman of the Army Committee, said that Germany is now actively working to manufacture war products, and is particularly focused on flying products. France's weakness is likely to invite war. (Reuters News Agency, 23rd)</p>

<p>The Total Amount Reaches 2.3 Billion Yuan, with Military Expenses Accounting for Half</p>
<p>3 Million Yuan More Than This Year's Budget</p>
<p>Military Adds 57.9 Million Yuan</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The first approved draft of the general budget for next year is 2.043 billion yen, plus the total amount of additional budgets approved, totaling 98 million yen, and 65 million yen for disaster budgets, etc., totaling 2.206 billion yen. There will be an increase of 5-6 million yen, so the budget for next year will actually reach an unprecedented amount, and the total amount of public bonds issued will be about 700 million yen. (Japan United News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The total number of the budget has now reached 2.206 billion yen, and the national defense budget reaches 1.021 billion yen, (including the navy's 530 million yen), accounting for 48% of the total budget. (Japan United News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese government's budget for the Showa 10th year was facing reefs due to the national defense budget issue, and it could not be resolved for a long time. However, the cabinet meeting on the 22nd, which lasted until 3:00 am this morning, took a sudden turn for the worse, and it was decided to approve an additional 57.9 million yen for the military budget. The army and navy were divided in half, each receiving 27 million yen, and the rest was for interest payments on public bonds. The source of funds for the above budget is as follows: an additional 40 million yen in public bonds, 2.4 million yen in special accounting for communications from the Ministry of Communications, 14.5 million yen in special accounting from the Ministry of Railways, and 960,000 yen in special accounting from the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, totaling approximately 57.9 million yen. The entire budget for the army and navy is as follows (in units of 1,000 yen):</p>
<p>Army Budget</p>
<p>Total number of first decision 451,000</p>
<p>First resurrection approved 13,000</p>
<p>Second resurrection approved 27,000</p>
<p>Total 491,000</p>
<p>Navy Budget</p>
<p>Basic budget 395,000</p>
<p>Total number of first decision 95,000</p>
<p>First resurrection approved 13,000</p>
<p>Second resurrection approved 27,000</p>
<p>Total 530,000</p>
<p>Finance Minister Fujii considered the 40 million yen of resurrection requests from various provinces to be the maximum amount approved by the Ministry of Finance, and stubbornly defended his fiscal policy. Therefore, the third budget cabinet meeting on the 22nd was indeed in turmoil, and it was not resolved until dawn the next day, creating a new precedent in financial history. The initial budget determined by the Ministry of Finance was 2.042 billion yen, the number of approvals for the first resurrection request was 40 million yen, and the resurrection budget decided at dawn on the 23rd was 43 million yen, plus the 60 million yen budget for disaster relief in the tenth year, totaling 2.185 billion yen, an increase of 3 million yen compared to this year's budget. Finance Minister Fujii merged the disaster budgets of various places with the general budget and the general budget for review. Although the military strongly demanded resurrection, he only approved 80 million yen, and reduced the number of public bonds issued from 810 million yen to 750 million yen. From a political standpoint, Finance Minister Fujii's budget compilation policy was a great success (Japan United News Agency, 22nd).</p>
<h3 id="e40">There are Two Ways to Break the Stalemate of the Naval Conference <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Allow Japan to Gradually Achieve Equality</p>
<p>Simon Believes it is More Promising</p>
<p>British and American Consultation on Actions Against Japan</p>
<p>[London] British Foreign Secretary Simon made a statement in the House of Commons today, completely denying the claim that the naval talks between Britain, the United States, and Japan have been decided. This means that there are still three ways to break the stalemate.</p>
<p>(1) Recover the ideal of allowing Japan to gradually achieve equality over a number of years in a certain way.</p>
<p>(2) Finally reach the equality of "4.4.4.", then the British and American navies must reduce matters.</p>
<p>(3) Japan accepts only discussions on qualitative restrictions.</p>
<p>The first way seems to be the most promising, because there are reasons to believe that Japan may clearly help to seek this solution. The second way is probably not favored by Britain and the United States, and the third way is also difficult to achieve, because refusing to discuss quantitative restrictions and only qualitative restrictions is one of the fundamental points of the Japanese plan. It is heard that the outside world has spread the rumor that Japan has officially acknowledged that Britain has the right to place a larger fleet than Japan, but does not acknowledge that the United States has this right. This is not accurate. Japan has requested a common higher limit for all countries, and Britain is also included in this.</p>
<p>Simon told the House of Commons today that the naval talks are still in progress, and it is unwise to announce the details at this time, but he can show its broad outlines.</p>
<p>Japan opposes the current rate In the current talks, Japan has made some suggestions, the purpose of which is to agree on a system in which each country can build ships to a common higher limit, that is, to reach its due total tonnage. The content of Japan's suggestions and the methods of reconciling differences raised by all parties cannot be reported in detail at this time.</p>
<p>Competition Leads to Disasters Simon continued, "The British government regards the breakdown of the naval restriction system as a disaster for everyone, not only for the countries that are currently meeting, but also for the whole world. If countries resume the arms race, the financial and political disasters will be obvious and there is no need to elaborate. The representatives of the British government do not have the will to break up the talks at all. If there is a glimmer of hope and a way to reconcile differences can be found, they intend to conduct the talks in a very friendly spirit.</p>
<p>Interpreting Equality The equality of security is an indisputable right that everyone should have, but this does not mean that the size of the fleets of all countries should be exactly the same. This depends on the responsibility in each event and the nature of everything else. The main purpose of our current discussion is to do our best to agree on a basis that can be used to obtain understanding without endangering the meaning of anyone's security. If we can roughly achieve this point, then we feel that there is a way to go for next year's conference. Of course, this will still depend on the opinions of the signatory countries such as France and Italy.</p>
<p>Notify France and Italy at Any Time Simon concluded that the United Kingdom has always been in close and friendly contact with other parties, and all developments in the naval talks are notified to the representatives of France and Italy at any time. (Reuters News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<p>Careful Consideration of Security and Equality</p>
<p>The Talks Did Not Involve Political Scope</p>
<p>[London] The third British-American consultation, which is the preparatory consultation for the current major crisis, seeks to discover any way out, and focuses on political diplomacy, began at 10:15 am on the 23rd in the British House of Commons. The British side was attended by British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon, and the American side was attended by Representative Davis and Councilor Atherton. (Japan United News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] After the British and American naval representatives met this morning, they firmly decided to continue exploring the issues. Both sides' representatives believed that there was no reason to abandon the hope of a final compromise. The British representative informed the American representative of the situation of the meeting between Foreign Secretary Simon and Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira earlier this week. The British and American delegations both acknowledged that Japan is now only concerned with the common maximum limit, and everyone believes that the exploration of both sides will focus on why Japan needs this, and to what extent Britain and the United States can accommodate this request. (Reuters News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Simon's claim that all countries are equal in security seems to have been agreed to by the American naval representatives. British and American representatives are now considering asking Japan some new questions based on the equality of security. British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon met with American Chief Representative Davis and American Embassy Counselor Atherton in the Prime Minister's office in the House of Commons this morning for two hours. After the talks, according to people from the American delegation, MacDonald and Simon informed Davis of the details of Simon's meeting with Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira. Then, British and American representatives exchanged views for a long time. It is reported that the result was very satisfactory, and it has been decided to continue to consider the possibility of reaching an understanding. However, no "agreement" has been reached between Britain and the United States, and the establishment of a "joint front" has not become an issue. It is also heard that the talks between British and American representatives this morning have not gone beyond the political scope of the naval issue and involved the technical scope. However, the current procedures for the naval talks have been raised for consideration. The above is the news obtained from the American delegation. Apart from this, it is generally believed that the opinions of the two main points between Britain and the United States seem to be consistent. First, the American representative stated that he fully agreed with Foreign Secretary Simon's explanation of security equality in the House of Commons yesterday. Second, the British and American delegations seemed to have considered asking Japan, based on the equality of security, the reason why it made the naval request, which was the change in the situation in the Far East after the signing of the Washington Treaty. However, what kind of changes have taken place in the situation in the Far East that are sufficient to increase the strength of the British and American navies? Or the reason for the increase in the strength of the Japanese navy? After the British and American representatives held talks this morning, Davis went to the countryside with Stanley, the Chief of Naval Operations of the American representative, to play golf. He will return to London around this evening. (Havas News Agency, 23rd)</p>

<p>Rumors of a British-Japanese Non-Aggression Treaty</p>
<p>As a Means of Threatening the United States</p>
<p>[London] The naval delegations of Britain and the United States will hold a meeting tomorrow. American people seem to fear that someone will use means to attribute the responsibility for the failure of the initial naval talks to the United States. Moreover, the American representative's mentality of maintaining the main principles seems to be more determined than before. Although the Washington government recently sent supplementary instructions to its representatives, the American government is still fundamentally opposed to the revision of the current treaty. It is rumored tonight that in order to subdue the United States, Britain and Japan may conclude a British-Japanese non-aggression treaty as the first stage of British-Japanese rapprochement, thinking to threaten the United States with this. However, Britain has always faithfully adhered to the promise of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and the firm intentions of its various autonomous territories and most of British public opinion, as well as the desire to preserve British-American relations, make the claim of British-Japanese rapprochement temporarily untrustworthy. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] It is heard that Britain and the United States have always intended to propose the political issues of the Far East in the London Naval Conference for discussion. However, until recently, the naval conference was in fact unable to break away from a state of stagnation, and the claim of revising the Nine-Power and Four-Power Treaties was rampant in Britain and the United States. At this juncture, the news that Ambassador Matsudaira met with Foreign Secretary Simon on the 19th and 21st to discuss political issues suddenly gave a great impetus to all sides. According to the news from all sides, the political issues discussed by Matsudaira and Simon seemed to be a new Pacific Locarno Treaty. According to the Japanese government's opinion, if this new treaty can promote the good relations between Britain, Japan, and the United States, and can achieve non-war work, and establish peace between the three countries in any form, then Japan will not hesitate to consider this issue. The conclusion of this treaty is not the renewal of the Nine-Power Treaty or the Four-Power Treaty, and it is completely separate from these two treaties and the naval conference. On the new foundation of ensuring peace in the Pacific, the so-called Pacific Locarno Treaty will be newly concluded. However, if this treaty is used as an exchange condition for determining Japan's military strength, Japan will absolutely oppose it. (Japan United News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e43">Second Step: The "Compromise Proposal" in the British Naval Talks <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[London] As the British government's attempt to negotiate a preliminary naval agreement has failed, it is now proposing the following three countermeasures as a second step:</p>
<p>(1) Qualitative Limitations</p>
<p>(2) Limitations on Pacific Defenses</p>
<p>(3) Notification of Shipbuilding Plans</p>
<p>These three points form the basis of the so-called "Compromise Proposal." It is reported that this proposal has already been presented to the American representative, and it will soon be formally presented to the Japanese delegation. The Japanese delegation is currently carefully considering this proposal, and its general intentions are as follows: (1) Absolutely disagree with the qualitative limitations proposal; (2) Have no objection to the continuation of limitations on Pacific defenses; (3) Shipbuilding notification is not a major issue and does not require special attention.</p>
<p>Moreover, the above items are all matters outside of the scope of instructions, so there is no need to request instructions from the home government. On the other hand, the American government has expressed absolute opposition to the separate continuation of limitations on Pacific defenses. Therefore, the attitudes of the Japanese and American delegations towards this Compromise Proposal are diametrically opposed. (22nd United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. advocates a 2:2:2 Ratio</p>
<p>Asia's Mainland Would Inevitably Be at Japan's Mercy</p>
<p>U.S. Authorities Indicate This is Unacceptable</p>
<p>[Washington] The Japanese government's statement that it agrees that naval equality should start with arms reduction was first heard today. The Japanese Embassy in Washington explained that, according to a statement by Ambassador Saitō published in the Christian Science Monitor, Japan advocates that all countries maintain smaller navies. Japan does not insist on the "5:5:3" or "4:4:4" naval ratio between the United States, Britain, and Japan, but is willing to accept a ratio of "3:3:3" or "2:2:2." Ambassador Saitō solemnly denied that he had told the Christian Science Monitor that domestic Japanese opinions on naval issues were divided, or that army and navy leaders now want to pressure the Prime Minister to expand armaments. He only hopes to avoid unnecessary naval competition. (22nd Guomin News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Washington] According to private expressions from U.S. authorities today, the U.S. government still cannot accept Ambassador Saitō's proposal of a 2:2:2 naval ratio. With such reductions in naval power, it would only be sufficient for use as a maritime police force, and the Asian mainland would inevitably be entirely at the mercy of Japan. Furthermore, this approach would result in Britain and the United States dismantling far more warships than Japan. In addition, the State Department stated that unless the Open Door Policy is changed, the United States will consistently oppose any movement for large-scale naval reduction.

<p>Seeking to Reach a Common Maximum</p>
<p>Washington Treaty Should Be Fundamentally Abolished</p>
<p>[London] After another meeting between Foreign Minister Simon and Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira yesterday afternoon, a British spokesperson said that "the pessimistic mood has decreased compared to before." Today, Japanese representative Rear Admiral Yamamoto specifically issued a statement to this newspaper's reporter to correct this, saying that although Ambassador Matsudaira's conversation with Foreign Minister Simon was extremely cordial, it did not indicate a change in Japan's attitude. The Japanese representatives are still determined to continue to make sincere efforts to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty and replace it with a more appropriate treaty. In my opinion, the Washington Treaty should be fundamentally abolished, and it is inappropriate to consider retaining any of its clauses. The current priority should be to establish a foundation for worldwide compromise, and not to limit it to the five countries (Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy) that signed the Washington Treaty, or the three countries (Britain, the United States, and Japan) that signed the London Treaty. Yamamoto also said that if a certain country believes that it is in the international interest to extend the qualitative limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty, then I believe that Japan would be happy to agree. (22nd Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] The Japanese delegation to the naval talks recently issued the following declaration: "Recently, newspaper reports about the naval talks have varied. Some say that Japan has acknowledged that Britain's naval power can be stronger than that of the United States and Japan, while others say that Japan has suggested that the naval power of Britain, the United States, and Japan should have a ratio of 5:4:4. All these rumors are not accurate and have no basis. Japan has repeatedly and clearly announced to the world that in the naval talks, it is determined to make its utmost efforts to reach a reasonable agreement based on the principle of a 'common maximum.'"

<p>Said to be a Journalist's Summary of His Remarks</p>
<p>Reviewed and Signed by Saitō Himself</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Former Prime Minister Count Saitō today denied writing an article for the American Christian Science Monitor regarding the naval conference, saying that he has not seen a reporter from that newspaper in recent months, nor has he written an article for the newspaper. However, in early August he read an article by a certain journalist, but it had nothing to do with arms reduction. According to the Christian Science Monitor, Saitō's remarks included that the London Naval Conference must succeed for the sake of world peace, and that anyone with correct thinking should know that bankrupting naval competition cannot achieve anything. Mr. Hersch, who compiled the article, said that the article disclosed by the Science Monitor a few days ago was written in August and was the result of several meetings with Saitō. The article summarized his views on the future of the navy. Saitō reviewed it, made corrections, and signed it. (23rd Reuters News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Christian Science Weekly recently published an article that it claimed contained statements by former Japanese Prime Minister Saitō. The Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saitō, has partially denied this article. The Ambassador formally stated that former Prime Minister Saitō had met with a journalist in August 1934 and made remarks, but the article published by the Christian Science Weekly is not something that the former Prime Minister can acknowledge, and he has not even seen it. Most of the content of the article published by the Christian Science Weekly is true, and Ambassador Saitō does not deny it. However, he solemnly denies the sections criticizing Japanese political parties, stating that Japanese public opinion on naval issues is divided, and that Japanese extremists are carrying out their conspiracies, intending to build the world's strongest navy. He said that the former Prime Minister did not make such statements. The Japanese Ambassador took the opportunity to declare that Japan has not sought to establish a 5:4:4 ratio between the navies of Britain, the United States, and Japan. The only basis that Japan can accept is a 3:3:3 ratio. (22nd Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e48">The British Labour Party's Attitude Towards the Indian Constitutional Reform Bill <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Prepared to Vote Against</p>
<p>[London] The opposition Labour Party believes that after the Indian Constitution draft was revised by the Joint Committee of both houses, and guarantee clauses were added, Indian autonomy exists in name only. When Parliament discusses this bill, the Labour Party will vote against it. It is noted that a portion of the Conservative Party (namely, the faction of former Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill) has consistently attacked the Constitution draft. Now that the Labour Party's attitude has also been made clear, the government's hope of obtaining some votes from the opposition to make up for the original majority can be said to be completely hopeless. However, the government's position is still stable and will definitely not encounter danger due to the Constitution draft issue. (22nd Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance replied to refined salt merchants, stating that the refined salt trade is limited to commercial ports throughout the country, as stipulated in the General Rules for Refined Salt. The locations of sales and tax payment methods will all be handled in accordance with established regulations and there will be no changes. Regarding the Shandong judgment case cited in the petition, the Salt Bureau believes that due to the different situations in each region, it is not appropriate to generalize the Shandong trial's judgment case to the entire country. An order has been issued to the Shandong Transportation Commissioner regarding this matter, and it should not be used as a basis for nationwide sales. As for the tax police's investigation and suppression of refined salt, it should be carried out when there are violations of the General Rules for Refined Salt. If the tax police interfere excessively, they should be stopped. The Ministry has now approved two measures: (1) Tax police, regardless of location, may not directly search people's homes for refined salt, nor do they need to monitor salt sales in front of salt stores. This applies when there are reports of refined salt being sold for profit in the interior; (2) If the purchase of refined salt in the original special case areas does not exceed the specified quantity, it should be released upon investigation en route. If other circumstances are found, it should be handled in accordance with the regulations. It is expected that the refined salt merchants will be notified to strictly abide by the specified sales scope in order to emphasize the salt law. (23rd special dispatch)</p>

<p>Oreste Makes Exaggerated Propaganda in Beiping</p>
<p>Beiping Martial Arts Circles Rise Up in Anger to Fight for National Honor</p>
<p>Ms. Yang is the Daughter of a Xingyiquan Instructor</p>
<p>Speaks Freely About Internal and External Skills and the Characteristics of National Martial Arts</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The social atmosphere in Beiping's lower and middle classes is characterized by both aristocratic, feudal, and class superstitions, and inherited habits of chivalry and generosity. In the late Qing Dynasty, before the era of police, local bullies roamed the streets, and women often dared not travel alone. The final degenerate form of this in Tianjin is called "Hunhun," while in Beijing it is called "Bashijiang" or "Wushujia" (martial artists). Although they do not know what formal chivalry looks like, they all have lessons from novels like "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants" or "The Cases of Peng Gong and Shi Gong" in their minds. They value loyalty and friendship, which are their strengths, but they also have a propensity for bravery, fighting, and violating the law with force, which is their weakness. For this reason, since the Republic of China, martial artists from other provinces and wandering performers, whenever they want to come to Beiping to perform or show off, must first pay respects in advance and hold a grand banquet for famous Beijing martial artists. Even the pillars of society, semi-gentry and semi-hooligans, high-level rogues, must be listed and invited to support the occasion, otherwise antipathy will arise, and they will use every means to make them fail on the spot and leave in disgrace. This is because Beiping and Hebei Province are indeed rich in martial arts talent, with fathers and sons, teachers and disciples, passing down secret oral formulas. Whether in theory or practice, they are not comparable to those who lack a family tradition or teacher. It is very easy for a large number of "insiders" and experts to concentrate and nitpick on one person. The social customs of Beiping, inherited from history, have long possessed such xenophobic roots, and coupled with the recent rise of patriotic thought and nationalism, they view it as even more developed. If a foreigner or someone from a different region comes to Beiping to perform, the Beiping society will not allow them to succeed, and this is naturally expected. This time, the Russian, Makarov, came to Beiping from Tianjin to sell martial arts. He neither paid respects in advance nor made extensive advertisements, claiming to be the strongest man in the world, with arms and feet capable of competing with two bulls, and hands capable of lifting a thousand pounds of iron hammers. His wording was unusually exaggerated, claiming that he had not met an opponent in various ports in both northern and southern China. Makarov himself was ignorant, and the Chinese manager who cooperated with him also did not understand the human relations of Beiping society, and stubbornly clung to the psychology of more than ten years ago, wanting to use the words "foreigner" to intimidate all opposition. The widespread social antipathy that arose was, of course, inevitable. On the second day Makarov took the stage at the Central Hotel, Shen Yousan, the leader of Beiping wrestlers (Shen won the championship in wrestling at the National Games last year in the martial arts category), visited him at the Jintai Hotel on Xiheyan Street, demanding a face-to-face wrestling match, otherwise, he should remove the words "the strongest man in the world, invincible in China." Makarov did not understand Chinese. Shen talked to him, but did not get anywhere. The next day, he led a young martial artist, a disciple of his, and visited Makarov again, still demanding a match. Makarov refused again. Shen's disciple saw two iron hammers, said to weigh a thousand pounds, which Makarov had put in the corner of the room, which Makarov used to show off on stage. Shen's disciple then lifted them lightly with an unconcerned attitude, moved them for a long time, and discarded them on the ground. Makarov was greatly frightened when he saw this, expressed humility, and said that a martial arts match might be dangerous and dared not accept the challenge. The next day, Shen brought a bow and arrow that he had hidden at home and visited Makarov alone, saying that if you can draw this bow, you can prove that you really have a thousand-pound broadsword, and there is no need for me to compete with you. If you cannot draw this bow, it proves that all your tricks on stage are magic tricks, and you are here to deceive China for money. This kind of test, you draw the bow for me to see first, and I will draw the bow for you to see later. There is no competition, so there is no danger, and you should happily agree to it, right? When Makarov heard Shen's words, he still resolutely refused, but said that he was willing to cooperate with Shen in performing and making money together. Shen firmly refused. His assistant, the so-called Chinese manager, even said, "If you annoy the foreigner, even if you don't have a martial arts match, he can still beat you up and cause an international dispute, which you cannot bear," and so on. Shen was greatly displeased and angrily told the famous figures in the Beiping martial arts community about the whole affair. So, following Shen, four or five people have sent letters to Makarov to challenge him to a martial arts match and visited him in person to request a test. Makarov felt the pain of coping with them, and the social psychology of Beiping unanimously supported Chinese national quintessence, and believed that Makarov's dare not compete was proof that he was deceiving and had no real strength. As a result, Makarov's business had very few attendees, and as a result, he only sold more than ten yuan a day, and was in a dilemma.</p>
<p>Just as this strongman was trapped in a hotel and preparing to leave the capital, a female general suddenly arrived. She is the daughter of Yang Jiaotou (instructor), a famous martial arts expert and a master of Xingyiquan from Hejian. Her name is Yang Jianxia. Hearing of Makarov's exaggeration, she wanted to express her feelings for Chinese martial arts. She came to Beiping from her hometown specifically to compete. As soon as she got off the car, she wrote to Makarov, saying, "I read in the newspaper yesterday that you boast of being invincible in the world. If you do not have real skills, you would never dare to boast so much. Although I am a woman, I am willing to compete with you to gain experience. If you are willing to teach me, please indicate the location and date. I am looking forward to it very much. Yang Jianxia sends her respects." Makarov did not respond to this letter. The reporter knew that among the Taijiquan experts in northern China, the Chen family from Chenjiagou in Henan was the founder, and the Xingyiquan school regarded Yang Jiaotou from Hejian as the master. His daughter, Jianxia, inherited the family's knowledge from a young age and won the championship by defeating several famous martial artists in the Baoding Martial Arts Competition. All circles in Beiping have long admired her as an extraordinary female knight. Therefore, the reporter rushed to visit her at Dayi Apartment in Piku Hutong. The lady received him. According to the conversation, "I am not particularly good at strength, or I might even be called 'weak' or 'powerless'. However, in the two areas of swordsmanship and internal strength, I was taught the oral formulas by my father, and I can see the metaphysical realm of Chinese martial arts that transcends the physical. The characteristics of Chinese martial arts are very different from Westerners who are as strong as cattle and specialize in wrestling. We not only do not rejoice in great strength, but even regard great strength as a disease. Therefore, limited by this kind of family tradition, I always regard fighting with people as a great taboo. Even if I sometimes try with an enemy, I am psychologically acting with an 'unavoidable' attitude. This time I came to Beiping, I had two missions: (1) Stimulated by the national crisis, I want to contribute my skills to the female compatriots in Beiping by establishing a Xingyiquan Women's Training Institute; (2) Driven by the idea of national self-strengthening, I do not want to let a Russian regard our Chinese people as nothing. This is the great reason why I wrote to Makarov yesterday, violating the taboos of my family tradition." When the lady spoke to this point, the reporter asked again about the scene of the Baoding Martial Arts Competition a few years ago. What technique did she use to fight against several men and throw them all off the "ring"? The lady said, "I first learned swordsmanship and internal strength. My father's most experienced learning is also in this area. Internal strength and sword are the best of metaphysical martial arts. Those who study this path must eventually reach the realm of 'moving with the spirit' to be considered successful. The opposite is true of external styles. No matter how calm and powerful, external styles cannot avoid the pain of tension when fighting with people. Internal styles purely take the attitude of 'waiting for work at ease' and 'controlling movement with stillness'. Therefore, I was able to defeat four or five men by myself at the Baoding Martial Arts Competition. The only reason is that the opponents I encountered at that time were all external styles, even though they were famous martial artists. They had already exhausted their strength when they first fought with me, and I did not have to seek victory, so I did not have to worry about mental exhaustion or consumption. When they weakened again and again, I won in one fell swoop. My consecutive victories against four or five people are better said to be victories with the spirit than with strength. In short, the strength of internal strength lies in this point. This cannot be understood without understanding it spiritually. It is very difficult to understand concretely when describing it verbally." It is said that Ms. Yang is the daughter of Yang, the grand master of "Xingyi" in North China. Her words are so exquisite that they are described in detail for the reference of martial arts experts and enthusiasts of martial arts. (21st)</p>

<p>Lost Middle School Students in the Province Found</p>
<p>Cai Zukang and Shen Jiapei, students of Songjiang Middle School in the province, are both 14 years old. Their academic performance is always among the best, and their personalities are also good. Boarding students at the school have a regular holiday every Wednesday. The two students asked for leave to go out at around 5 pm on the 21st, but they did not return that night. The school notified their families and searched together, but they were not found. It was not until today that they were spotted by the road protection soldiers stationed in Shihudang, who questioned them and learned that the students wanted to live in seclusion, support themselves, and did not want to be supported by their families or study. Observing their expressions, it seemed that they had been stimulated. One student lived in Fengjing and was sent back to Fengjing to his family, while the other was escorted back to school by the soldiers.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Preventing the Export of Silver, Domestic Silver Shipments Require Passports <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Customs Issues Public Notice on Order of the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Large Amounts Shipped Out in Recent Days, Silver Market Extremely Tight</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that in order to prevent the large-scale export of silver, the Ministry of Finance increased the export tax on silver on October 15 and established the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee. The export of silver has gradually decreased. However, with the continued rise in silver prices abroad in recent days, unscrupulous merchants have been shipping silver to the mainland and smuggling it for export, resulting in a sharp increase in silver leaving the country and a tightening of the silver market. The Ministry of Finance specifically ordered the Jianghai Customs on the 22nd that all domestic shipments of silver must have a passport from the Ministry of Finance before they can be shipped. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Customs Issues Public Notice Requiring Passports for Silver Shipments</p>
<p>Tang Hai'an, Superintendent of Jianghai Customs, and Robert Bredon, Commissioner of Customs, jointly issued a notice stating: In order to issue a public notice, in accordance with the order of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, starting from November 21 of this year, all banks must have their passports from the Ministry of Finance inspected by the customs when transporting whole boxes or bags of silver coins domestically before they can be shipped. Those who transport without passports will be regarded as smuggling, and the goods will be confiscated in accordance with regulations. All merchants are hereby notified.</p>
<p>Preventing Unscrupulous Merchants from Smuggling for Export</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that recently, mainland agricultural products, such as cotton and grains, have been harvested and traded on the market, requiring the use of silver. Therefore, in recent days, silver coins have been shipped from Shanghai to various mainland ports, such as Hankou, Tianjin, Beiping, Shantou, Xiamen, Qinhuangdao, Qingdao, and Yantai, in large quantities. From the 1st to the 15th of this month, it is estimated that about 3.54 million yuan was shipped. However, some merchants, motivated by profit, saw that silver prices abroad were still higher than those in the country, so they took this opportunity to transfer silver to the mainland and then smuggle it for export in order to make profits. In order to prevent smuggling for export, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, in addition to requesting the Ministry of Finance to order all customs offices that domestic shipments of silver must have passports from the Ministry of Finance before they can be shipped, also carefully considered the balancing tax announced at 10 am every day before deciding to announce it, with the intention of reducing smuggling. At the same time, Guangdong, Sichuan, Gansu, and other provinces have also issued orders prohibiting the export of silver to prevent unscrupulous merchants from smuggling.</p>
<p>Silver Discount Rises Sharply by 25 Cents</p>
<p>Recently, the silver discount in the city has risen sharply from 15 cents to 25 cents due to the sharp increase in silver coin exports, the reduction in silver reserves, and the increasingly tight silver market. This is a phenomenon that has not been seen in years. Usually, during the autumn and winter seasons when agricultural products are launched on the market, the silver discount is higher than in the spring and summer seasons due to the need for silver in various places, but it has never been as high as 25 cents this year. This is also affected by the large-scale export of silver. According to financial circles, after the Customs announces that domestic shipments of silver coins must have passports from the Ministry of Finance before they can be shipped, the silver discount is expected to fall back.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Another Huge Amount of Silver Shipped to the United States Today <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>

<p>Yesterday, a certain foreign bank reported the shipment of one million yuan in silver, all of which were Chinese national coins, divided into 200 boxes. In the afternoon, it contacted the Dalae Foreign Company to entrust the Lincoln Presidential ship to leave Shanghai today and ship the silver to New York, USA. It paid 77,500 yuan in export tax in accordance with the new regulations. This is the fourth batch of silver shipped out after China increased its silver tariffs.</p>

<p>Dr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, has been staying in Shanghai and has been busy socializing with Chinese and foreign friends in recent days. It is learned that Mr. Wang visited Kong Xiangxi again at West Ainsworth Road at 3:30 pm yesterday, had a conversation for about 20 minutes, and then left. Subsequently, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Wang and inquired about the content of his visit to Kong. According to Mr. Wang, he did not talk about the Southwest issue during his visit to Kong yesterday, but simply inquired about Chairman Chiang and others. As for his trip to Beijing, it will probably not be possible until next week. Chairman Chiang has not sent a telegram to Shanghai since arriving in Beijing.</p>

<p>Expeditiously Rectify Sichuan Politics</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sichuan Fellow Provincials Association held an emergency executive committee meeting at its office yesterday. More than ten people attended, including Li Xunfu, Zhang Shulin, Qiu Zhizhong, Deng Youguang, Zhong Hangsu, Wen Disheng, Tang Zhonghou, Liu Xueqiao, Wu Youdan, and Tan Jiqing. The meeting was chaired by Zhong Hangsu, and many important matters were resolved. Two telegrams were drafted on the spot and presented to the Central Government and Liu Xiang, requesting their adoption and implementation. The original telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To the Central Government Telegram, Urgent. Respected Chairman Lin of Nanjing, Chairman Chiang, and President Wang, Communist bandits have been fleeing to Sichuan for two years. Due to military, political, and financial relations, not only has Kuang's banditry in northern Sichuan not been wiped out, but various communist bandits such as Xiao, He, Zhu, and Mao are also likely to take the opportunity to enter Sichuan and join forces. Our association believes that this serious problem is not a local issue in Sichuan, but a key to the survival of the entire Chinese nation. Therefore, we convened an emergency executive committee meeting today and immediately resolved to contribute five measures to the Central Government for suppressing the bandits and securing Sichuan: (1) Please send a senior military officer from the Central Government to sit in western China, provide instructions to various provinces on bandit suppression strategies at any time, and clearly define rewards and punishments to implement supervision; (2) Please urgently telegraph the Shaanxi army to immediately dispatch a large army to northern Sichuan to cooperate with the various Sichuan bandit suppression armies, with the aim of achieving a pincer attack; (3) Please instruct the leaders of Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, and Guizhou to encircle the main force of the communist bandits fleeing westward and send a large army to intercept them to prevent them from fleeing into Sichuan and joining forces with Kuang, Xiao, He, and other bandits; (4) Please earnestly begin to rectify Sichuan's finances and统筹统支 (统筹统支 is difficult to translate exactly, but it roughly means 'centrally plan and allocate') bandit suppression military expenses; (5) Please expedite the promotion of Sichuan politics in accordance with the principle of 30% military affairs and 70% political affairs. The above five points are simple methods for suppressing bandits and securing Sichuan. Our association believes that the current situation is urgent, like eggs piled on top of each other. We feel the danger and dare not remain silent. We hope that you will adopt our suggestions, and Sichuan's future and the nation's future will both benefit. We are sending this telegram with trepidation and look forward to your clear instructions. Sichuan Fellow Provincials Association respectfully.</p>
<p>To Liu Xiang Telegram, Urgent. Respected Supervisor Liu of Nanjing, you were able to come to Beijing resolutely to petition the Central Government, which is what our association sympathizes with. However, our association believes that this opportunity is serious and critical, and we cannot remain silent, nor do we dare to remain silent. We have convened an emergency meeting today to offer several opinions: (1) Please immediately reorganize and equip the various bandit suppression armies in Sichuan and strictly order all the previous commanders who avoided their duties to atone for their crimes, otherwise, they will be removed from their posts and punished first; (2) Please issue a mobilization order immediately and establish contact with the Shaanxi army. If the various Sichuan commanders are still hesitant and do not move forward, then they will be punished by military law; (3) Please telegraph the leaders of Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces to strike head-on at the communist bandits, wipe them out together, and prevent Zhu Mao's main force from occupying Sichuan and causing trouble to the whole country; (4) Please thoroughly investigate the financial staff and replace those who are not capable. If anyone has embezzled previous bandit suppression military pay, they will be dismissed and ordered to compensate. Future military pay must be used on the soldiers. If there are any cases of embezzlement or deductions, they will be punished by military law; (5) Please order the commanders of all armies under your command to immediately abolish all kinds of exorbitant taxes and strictly prohibit the pre-collection of taxes; (6) Please encourage the export of Sichuan's local products and promote them abroad, and exempt them from taxes to facilitate promotion, offset imports, and save the economic crisis; (7) Please restore student loans and, for students who remit tuition fees out of Sichuan, please instruct all banks to waive remittance fees if the fees are certified by the schools and local educational institutions. All the above points are important matters. Since you were able to come to Beijing with awareness, you should be able to accept the public opinion of our association with sincerity. We hope that you will give us detailed instructions. Sichuan Fellow Provincials Association respectfully.</p>

<p>County Government Convenes a Meeting</p>
<p>Resolves Various Measures</p>
<p>Shanghai County originally planned to start winter defense on December 1. However, due to the frequent occurrence of theft cases in the county, in order to maintain local tranquility, it was decided to start early and issue a notice yesterday to implement it immediately. The county government convened a winter defense meeting, attended by Xu Yuyin, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Lu Zhongyu, Commander of the First Security Squadron, and Wu Shifang, Li You, Tian Wang Chengyao, Fu Dianying, and Xing Zhigang, Directors of various districts.

<h3 id="e95">Four Provinces' Match Industry Implements Merger <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Preparations are underway, and a preparatory office has been established and is actively proceeding</p>
<p>Named the Greater China Match Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Xinxin News Agency reports: Our country's domestic match industry has recently been experiencing overproduction and a sharp drop in market prices, causing considerable panic among the industry. Consequently, Sun Runzhai of the China Match Factory and others, in addition to requesting government relief, also sought self-improvement measures within the industry, leading to the proposal of merging the operations of eight factories in four provinces. Recognizing the significant impact of this matter on the future of domestic goods, the Xinxin News Agency reporter paid a special visit to Gao Songfu, a magnate in the match industry. According to Mr. Gao, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Consulting on Relief: Mr. Gao first stated that, in recent years, the industry has seen the rise of new factories, resulting in annual production exceeding demand. Products from various factories have been stockpiling, and the abundance of inventory in the market has led to a continuous decline in wholesale prices, causing considerable anxiety within the industry. Subsequently, initiated by Sun Runzhai of the China Match Factory, various industry peers were invited to convene a series of joint meetings to discuss relief measures. It was decided to request government assistance and to formulate four measures for the authorities to adopt and implement, including: (1) Requesting restrictions on the establishment of new factories, as the existing match factories nationwide are sufficient for current needs. Adding new factories would inevitably lead to oversupply, so the government should restrict them. (2) Requesting restrictions on production to ensure supply and demand are balanced. (3) Requesting limitations on sales regions. (4) Requesting price controls. Regarding the above four points, the government has agreed to implement the feasible ones as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Unified Operations: Regarding the industry's collective efforts for self-rescue, apart from the method of merging operations, there is no other better solution. Joint sales by industry members can avoid industry competition and hidden price drops, which is unified operations. This allows for planned organization and external sales. Consequently, the industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei provinces has joined forces, including eight factories: Nantong Tong Sui, Ningbo Zhengda, Linhuai Huai Shang, Hankou Chu Sheng, Shanghai Hua Ming, China, Da Ming, and Da Hua. They have merged to form the preparatory office of the Greater China Match Co., Ltd., and Mr. He Shichang of Zhengda Factory has been appointed as the head of the preparatory office to actively promote the process.</p>
<p>Merger Outline: The company's merger outline has been passed and is recorded as follows: Article 1: This merger involves dissolving the old companies and forming a new company, named the Greater China Match Co., Ltd., with a tentatively set capital of one million national currency. The merged companies will retain their original names. When the company is registered, the original names of the merged companies will be attached for registration. Article 2: After the merger of each company, all original stocks will be invalidated. The number of shares to be received in the new company shall be based on the net value of the total original assets of each company (hereinafter referred to as net assets, i.e., the result of subtracting liabilities from fixed and current assets). Article 3: Regarding the method of asset valuation, all assets of each factory will be divided into fixed assets and current assets. Fixed assets, such as depreciation of factory buildings, machinery, and equipment, and the price of land, and current assets, such as raw materials and finished products, will be fairly valued by the valuation committee. If there is disagreement, a neutral person will be asked to arbitrate. Article 4: Accounts receivable from each company, excluding bad debts, may be included in the calculation of current assets. Article 5: All liabilities of each company shall be settled independently. The company may retroactively recognize any existing items and original credit loans. Article 6: The valuation committee shall be determined by the preparatory committee, with one person from each factory and two additional neutral persons. Separate detailed rules will be set for the valuation of each factory's assets. Article 7: Regarding the identification of trademarks, each company has numerous original trademarks. After the merger, the reputable ones will be retained, and unnecessary ones will be deleted as appropriate. After the existing trademarks are used up, the words "Supervised by Greater China Match Co., Ltd." should be added to the original trademark to indicate identification. Article 8: This merger will continue to lease the rented factories, houses, and land from the company. Article 9: If the company needs them, the company may inherit and merge any subsidiary assets of each factory. Article 10: The company will employ the original employees of each company according to their abilities. Article 11: If there are any matters not covered in this outline, they should be discussed jointly by each factory and added or deleted at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Minsheng Company's Self-Built Minquan New Steamer Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The largest steamer in the Sichuan River cost a total of 200,000 yuan</p>
<p>Will set sail on the Shanghai-Chongqing line as soon as the deck is installed</p>
<p>The new steamer Minquan, built by Minsheng Industrial Company, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing yesterday morning and berthed at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong. It was decided to install the deck in Shanghai and then sail on the Shanghai-Chongqing line when the water rises. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Self-Built Process: On March 5th of last year, Minsheng Company purchased the hull of the Wanliu steamer from the British Taikoo Shipping Company for 500 Shanghai taels. The Wanliu steamer had run aground and sunk at the Chaipanzi area above Changshou on the Sichuan River. After two days of rescue efforts, it was finally salvaged. On May 19th of the same year, it was towed back by the Minkang steamer and berthed at the Minsheng Company Shipyard in Qingcaobao, Sichuan. Construction began in January of this year to lengthen the hull. It took more than ten months to complete and was named the Minquan.</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday: The Minquan steamer is 219 feet 11 inches long, 31 feet wide, 10 feet deep, has a draft of 8 feet 4 inches, a speed of approximately 13.5 miles per hour, a gross tonnage of approximately 1,200 tons, and a net tonnage of approximately 700 tons. It is the largest steamer on the Sichuan River, costing approximately 200,000 yuan to build. After completion, it sailed from Chongqing to Shanghai on the 4th of this month, carrying cargo. It stopped at various ports, such as Wanxian and Hankou, to load and unload passengers and goods. It arrived in Shanghai at 9 a.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Welcoming the New Steamer: After arriving in Shanghai, it berthed at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong. The shipowner is Zhou Haiqing, and the manager (i.e., compradore) is Weng Jingxun. Upon arrival in Shanghai, Zhang Shulin, the manager of the Shanghai branch of Minsheng Company, led all the staff to Pudong Wharf to welcome the steamer. A large number of firecrackers were prepared and set off upon arrival. The deck of the steamer has not yet been installed and will be installed in Shanghai at an estimated cost of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>History of the Minquan: When the Minquan steamer first entered the Sichuan River in the early years of the Republic of China, it was named Longmao and was owned by the British Longmao Foreign Company. At that time, it was 204 feet long, 31 feet wide, 10 feet deep, had a draft of 8 feet 2 inches, a speed of 14.5 miles per hour, a gross tonnage of 1,112 tons, and a registered tonnage of 671 tons. It was built by the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard in 1920. It began sailing to Sichuan in June of the Republic of China. Due to careless navigation, it crashed into a rock in the Yichang Gorge. On November 24th of the same year, it sailed to Shanghai for repairs. In 1924, Longmao sold it to Taikoo, and it was renamed Wanliu. In 1926, it caused the Wanxian Massacre. On May 31st, 1931, it ran aground in the Chaipanzi area above Changshou. It was submerged due to rising water. After several days, the Taikoo Foreign Company and insurance company deemed it impossible to salvage, so the Taikoo Foreign Company sold it to Minsheng Company.</p>

<h3 id="e102">The French Concession Levies Boiler Inspection Fees Again from Hongxing Hosiery Factory <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Claiming to be based on the Boiler Management Regulations</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports: The issue of factory inspections in the concessions has been negotiated with the concession authorities by our government, but has not yet been resolved. The Hongxing Hosiery Factory on Caishi Road in the French Concession was levied 70 yuan in factory inspection fees by the French Concession Public Works Department in the first half of this year. Later, the Machinery Federation requested the Municipal Government and the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession to protest. The case has not been resolved to this day. Yesterday, the Bureau sent a letter to the factory, based on Article 54 of the newly promulgated French Concession Boiler Management Regulations, to levy 35 yuan in boiler inspection fees from the factory. The factory believes that money is a small matter, but the sovereignty of the country is a big matter, so it specially submitted it to the Machinery Federation to request negotiation and forwarded it to the Ministry of Industry and the Municipal Government for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Record of the Opening of the Wuhua Bank Lawsuit <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The defendant stated that the debt could be repaid</p>
<p>The court must summon three representatives from the head office to inquire</p>
<p>After the Shanghai branch of Wuhua Industrial Bank, located at 130 Ningbo Road in the Public Concession, and the Baxianqiao branch in the French Concession closed simultaneously on August 21 of this year, the Shanghai branch immediately appointed lawyers Wu Kaisheng, Jiang Yiping, Chen Chengyin, and accountants Jiang Wanping, Wang Sifang, and Chen Xianmo to announce the liquidation. The Guangzhou Wuhua Bank head office also sent three representatives, Xu Yuangao, Huang Linsheng, and Yang Yigong, to Shanghai to act as full agents, appointing lawyers Luo Jiaheng and Pan Zhenya, and accountant Li Zheng to liquidate. The two sides argued and published in newspapers, starting a pen war. Subsequently, ten households, including depositors and debtors of the two banks, Zhu Longgen and Chen Xianji, separately extended lawyers Zhang Shijie, Lou Yunmei, Mao Fengwu, and Xu Jie to file a criminal complaint with the Second Special District Court, accusing the branch's deputy managers Fan Shaoliang and Ye Haitian, the branch's deputy managers Wang Jian'e and Wu Yousan, the branch's assistant managers Xie Shunzhi and Tang Songshan, and the consultants Tang Shoumin and Chen Bingqian of fraud, requesting that they be interrogated according to law. According to the complaint, the court once summoned them on September 26, but the defendants did not arrive and the date was changed. The details have been recorded in previous reports. At 3:30 p.m. yesterday, judge Xiong Huiping, accompanied by clerk Tao Zongkan, specially opened the second criminal court to hear the case. The ten plaintiffs, Zhu Longgen, etc. (the names have been detailed in previous reports), each arrived with their lawyers. Except for Chen Bingqian, who was recuperating in Moganshan and appointed a lawyer as an agent, all the defendants arrived with their defense lawyers Wu Kaisheng, Hua Maosheng, and Zheng Wenkai. First, the plaintiff Zhu Longgen stated that he accused the defendants of opening a bank without registering with the government, using several years of planning as a fraudulent means to deceive people into depositing savings, and breaching trust by using advertisements to deceive depositors. I deposited money at the Baxianqiao branch. The official asked Fan and Ye if they were the deputy managers of the branch, and Xie and Tang were the assistant managers and consultants. What does your deposit at the branch have to do with the other six people? He replied, their branches are connected and closed. The night before the closure, they hired a car to move the branch's belongings. There are rumors to that effect. At this point, the plaintiff's agent, lawyer Lou Yunmei, stated that it was found that the moving of the belongings was done by Xiangsheng Motor Company, numbers 18498 and 18491. At that time, there was also an accountant from the branch who was detained by the police. The defendant's lawyer, Wu Kaisheng, stated that the police had investigated this matter at that time, and because there was no criminal relationship, it was not accepted. He requested the court to investigate with the police. The official then asked the remaining plaintiffs, who all stated that their opinions were the same as what Zhu Longgen said. Some of the money was deposited in the branch, and some in the branch. Now they demand the return of the money and request that it be handled according to law, etc. At this point, the official questioned the manager of the defendant branch, Wang Jian'e, who stated that he had no right to inquire about registration. The branch sent me to be the manager of the branch. The reason for the closure was that the branch's financial turnover was not working well. The branch also closed because it could not be maintained. The branch has a capital of 500,000, and the head office in Guangzhou has a capital of about 2 million. Other branches are still operating normally. After the closure of the Shanghai branch, the head office sent three representatives, Xu Yuangao, Huang Linsheng, and Yang Yigong, to Shanghai to fully liquidate and repay the debts. The accounts of the public and branch have been cleared. After offsetting the income and expenditure, there is still a surplus of more than 100,000. The first step now is to repay the savings, and the second step is to repay the current deposits, which can be fully repaid in the future. Now, the two houses must be topped out, etc. Then, the branch manager Fan Shaoliang testified that he was the manager of the branch and the head office was registered in Hong Kong. The official said, you should also register in Shanghai. He replied, this is the right of the head office. Asked, what is the reason for this closure? He replied, because the income and payment turnover cannot be offset, resulting in the closure. However, there is more than 100,000 owed on the accounts, but there is no actual loss. Now the liquidation office has notified the debtors to recover the debts. The branch's houses have been topped out, and more than 20,000 gold have been obtained. In my opinion, savings can be repaid in the shortest time, more than a month, and current deposits can also be repaid by the end of the lunar year. Moreover, the branch's debts are the responsibility of the head office and must be repaid. Regarding whether to resume business in the future, the right is with the head office, I cannot say. Then asked the two deputy managers of the branch, Ye Haitian and Wu Yousan, who replied that their meaning was the same as what Wang and Fan said. Xie Shunzhi testified that although he was the assistant manager of the branch, his position was equal to that of a staff member. He now hopes that the head office will be responsible for the liquidation. Tang Songshan testified that he was the assistant manager of the branch and was not responsible for the branch's affairs. Because above the assistant manager, there are also treasurers and consultants. Tang Shoumin testified that Fan Shaoliang asked me to serve as a consultant. In fact, he had never been to the bank, and Fan had never asked me, so I don't know the details. However, the consultant's position is only advisory. At this point, the court stated that it still needs to investigate the case and must summon the three representatives sent by the head office for liquidation. It then announced that it would be scheduled to summon and hear the case again, and then adjourned.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Fourteen Years in Prison</p>
<p>The monk Huitang, from Jiangbei, is 38 years old. He was ordained at the Baiyun Temple. Because he did not follow the rules, he was expelled by the abbot and lived at the home of news vendor Miao Yaoting at 224 North Fujian Road. Recently, he suddenly moved to 157 on the same road. At 3 p.m. on the 20th of last month, Huitang went to Miao's house to visit Yaoting. Miao and his wife Gu were out, and only Miao's ten-year-old daughter, Miao Abao, was at home. The monk had bad intentions and raped Miao's daughter. Huitang was infected with gonorrhea, and Miao's daughter was also infected after being raped. After her parents noticed, they reported it to the police and took the monk to the First Special Court. Because Abao was deeply poisoned, she was treated in the hospital and could not attend court, so it was repeatedly postponed. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Abao was able to reluctantly attend court. Judge Wu Tingqi took the seat in the eighth criminal court. After questioning, he announced the verdict in court, sentencing Huitang to fourteen years in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Central Bank to Undertake Construction of Qoukiang Wharf <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Construction Cost of Three Million, Expanding Original Plan</p>
<p>Special Committee Formed for Design, Construction to Begin Soon</p>
<p>Upon Completion, Jianghai Customs Plans to Relocate for Office</p>
<p>Qoukiang Wharf, the only great building in the city center area, after the municipal government completed its planning, was originally intended to begin construction immediately. However, due to limited funding, it has been delayed until now and has not yet been realized. Recently, the Central Bank believed that after the completion of the wharf, ships entering the Huangpu River from overseas in the future could be completely docked there, which would not only benefit water conservancy and commerce, but also prosper the market. It would have a great relationship with business, transportation, economy, and so on, so it was very happy to invest. Now, it has been decided that the Central Bank will undertake the project and form a special committee to proceed. Its plan is even greater than that approved by the municipal government, costing about more than three million, and it can be regarded as the only major project in the customs aspect of our country. The details obtained are as follows:</p>
<p>Bank Investment Qoukiang Wharf is one of the major constructions in the city center area. In recent years, the municipal government has been working hard on the construction work in the city center area. For example, the municipal hospital, swimming pool, sports field, sports field, municipal park, etc., have all started construction one after another. However, although there is determination for the construction of Qoukiang Wharf, the project is very great, and the stipulated funding reaches two million yuan. After the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the municipal government's income suddenly decreased significantly, and there was no surplus funds to seek construction. Therefore, the construction of this Qoukiang Wharf was virtually suspended. Recently, the Central Bank believed that after the completion of the wharf, ship transportation would be concentrated in the area and the market would prosper, which is also expected. Therefore, it is willing to invest in undertaking the project. It has been in contact with the municipal government several times and has reached an agreement.</p>
<p>Construction to Begin Soon The Central Bank believes that Qoukiang Wharf will be the only intermediary agency for developing the commercial economy of the city center area in the future, so it has great hope. According to the original plan of the municipal government, the cost of constructing Qoukiang Wharf is a total of two million. The bank intends to expand the original plan of the municipal government, increase construction costs, and improve various equipment. Now the estimated construction cost is about three to four million yuan, and a special committee has been organized to carry out this matter, and construction will begin soon.</p>
<p>Bird's-eye View of the Situation Qoukiang Wharf is in the middle of the Huangpu River, northeast of Yangshupu Jungong Road. The land is the deepest part of the entire Huangpu River. The river surface is wide, and any large wheel can be docked. On one side, it can be connected to Songhu Road and Sanmin Road, and on the other side, it controls the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The terrain is quite majestic.</p>
<p>Customs Relocation The Jianghai Customs is currently considering a major issue, that is, after the completion of Qoukiang Wharf, it may relocate there, which is not yet known. The current overseas rounds entering can only stop at Yangshupu Wharf. If they enter further, because the small wheels south of Yangshupu are as dense as stars, there is a risk of collision from time to time. The river surface is narrow and cannot turn around, so it cannot directly enter the abdomen. Therefore, if a large wheel arrives in Shanghai, the customs must send a small wheel from the new customs wharf to pick up and drop off, which is very inconvenient. If Qoukiang Wharf is built, all ships will directly dock at the wharf, because that place is the first wharf to enter from the Wusongkou. The entry of giant ships can reduce the itinerary, and passengers can directly disembark without the need for small wheels to pick up and drop off, which is very convenient. At the same time, all loading, unloading, and goods will also be at the wharf. If Jianghai Customs is still at the new customs, its tax revenue will be greatly reduced. Therefore, after the establishment of Qoukiang Wharf, Jianghai Customs may also relocate to the area for office.</p>

The suspects Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, Tang Qingyue, and others, after being arrested by the French Concession police and transferred to the Second Special Court, were prosecuted. After the trial, the four defendants were declared not guilty. Because the police department disagreed with the judgment, it filed an appeal to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The victim Zhou Jinggeng also filed an appeal on the incidental civil lawsuit part. After a thorough investigation and court hearing by the High Court, the appeal was rejected. The various situations have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper.

<p>A Sharp Kitchen Knife Inserted into the Younger Brother's Neck, He is Already Dead</p>
<p>The Elder Brother with Seven Knife Wounds All Over His Body is Also in Critical Condition</p>
<p>—The Inside Story Has Not Yet Been Ascertained—</p>
<p>At 4:45 yesterday morning, when the sky had not yet dawned, a bizarre murder occurred in Building 34 of Chongde Fang, a newly built building at the intersection of Dongxin Bridge Street and Minguo Road in the French Concession. The victims were two brothers from other places living in Shanghai. The younger brother's head had been chopped off, and the elder brother was seriously injured and his life was also in critical condition. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Brothers Living Together There are more than a dozen newly built three-story houses at the intersection of Fahua Minguo Road at the southern end of Dongxin Bridge Street, French Concession. The lane is named Chongde Fang, and the house number 24 in the lane is a single three-story house, which is leased by Dai Chen, a local woman who sets up a fish stall in the Caishi Street. In addition to living in the living room downstairs, the remaining rooms upstairs are rented to others. A year ago, two brothers from Henan, Zhang Guanghua (26 years old) and Zhang Guangzhou (18 years old), rented the pavilion room on the second floor of the house.</p>
<p>Calling for Help According to Zhang Guanghua, he worked in the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, and his brother Guangzhou was studying at a school in Shanghai. The two brothers went out early and returned late, without any other differences. The friends who came and went were also very few. But until about 5:00 yesterday morning, French police officer No. 455, Yue Pu, was patrolling the lane with a gun and suddenly heard a loud cry for help from house No. 24. He immediately informed Yue Pu No. 194 and Chinese police officers No. 644 and No. 380, and ran to the nearby iron fence patrol booth to report to the police station.</p>
<p>One Dead and One Injured The police chief immediately sent a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to arrive. When they entered the house, they saw Zhang Guanghua lying down on the awning of the stove room, covered in blood and dying. When they went to the pavilion room on the second floor to check, they saw the room door was tightly closed, so they rushed in together. They saw Guangzhou lying naked and stiff on the ground, with blood all over the ground. A sharp kitchen knife was still inserted into his neck. The skull had been broken, and only an inch or so of flesh was connected. He had already died. The detectives checked the house and found more than one hundred yuan in banknotes and foreign currency in the wallet, and a few tables and chairs, but nothing else.</p>
<p>The Injured with Seven Knives After the detectives finished the examination, they inquired from the neighbors living in the same house. They all said that they were all sleeping. When they heard the cry for help and came out to see, the tragedy had already been done, and the murderer was nowhere to be seen. The detectives quickly used a car to send Guanghua to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was found that he had a total of seven knives on his body, including five knives on his head, one knife on the neck and one on the right ear. Guangzhou's body was taken away by the coroner's office to wait for the Second Special Court to examine it. At 11:00 noon, Prosecutor Wang Ren came to the office and confirmed that he died of knife wounds. He then summoned witnesses Yan Jintao and Dai Rongxiang, the son of the second landlord, for questioning.</p>
<p>Four or Five Murderers Then the detective presented a murder weapon to the case. The official stated that the deceased had no family members in Shanghai and instructed the hall to handle the burial. The police station sent detectives to Renji Hospital to inquire about Zhang Guanghua's situation at that time. It was said that at that time, four or five thugs broke into the pavilion room, and without saying a word, they raised their axes and chopped at the two of us. I escaped by jumping out of the window, but I was seriously injured. As for how my brother died, I don't know. However, the police station believed that the case was bizarre and conducted a thorough investigation in all directions. It was faintly heard that Zhang Guanghua had been fired from the Navigation Administration Bureau the day before.</p>

<p>The Yan Shuang Qin Case Has Ended</p>
<p>The Lin Yu Jin Matter Arises Again</p>
<p>Sheng Yuchang, the grandson of Sheng Xuanhuai, a former Qing Dynasty official, who currently resides at No. 1 Beidang Road, French Concession, fell in love with Yan Shuangqin, the daughter of Yan Minghan, a Taoist priest living in Kang Nai Tuo Road, and lived together for nearly three years. Until the year before last, the love between the two suddenly broke down, and the two separated immediately. Yan Shuangqin and her parents, with the qualifications of legal representatives, jointly hired a lawyer to sue Sheng Yuchang for abandonment in the Second Special District Court. After several court hearings, until July of last year, the relationship was restored, and a unconditional reconciliation was reached. The Yan party withdrew the lawsuit and the case was closed. Now, Lin Yujin has hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the criminal court of the Second Special Court, suing Sheng Yuchang for abandonment. Upon receiving the complaint, the court has issued a summons and notified both parties to appear in the Second Criminal Court at 2:00 pm today to hear the case. It is estimated that Criminal Court Chief Wang Gangxu will still hear the case.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Scheme to Pick up Iron Sheets Results in Over 4,000 Gold Being Swindled Away <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Rong Changnian Escapes Without a Trace</p>
<p>Zhu Fuxiang Cannot Shirk Responsibility</p>
<p>Qin Ziwei, the comprador of the packing factory of the French-Shang Yongxing Foreign Firm in Lujiazui, Pudong, purchased iron sheets for packing from Jifeng Iron Firm at No. 671 Zhejiang Road in May of this year through the solicitation of Rong Changnian, a hardware broker, for a total of 6,700 yuan. The usual procedure for picking up goods is that Qin pays the money and then exchanges the payment at Jifeng Iron Firm for the bill of lading to pick up the goods. On the 2nd of this month, there were still iron sheets worth 4,109 yuan that had not been picked up. Qin then sent his partner Jiang Ruifu to take the passbook to the Nanjing Road Bund wharf on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, while he was disembarking. Unexpectedly, the broker Rong Changnian was already waiting at the wharf. After talking with Jiang, he asked Jiang whether he had brought the money. Jiang replied that he had brought it. The two talked as they walked. Rong claimed to Jiang that the bill of lading for the iron sheets had been mortgaged to the Shanghai Bank. Now that he wanted to pick up the goods, he had to redeem the bill of lading from the Shanghai Bank. He instructed Jiang to wait at the Shanghai Bank market, and he would come later. After saying that, they parted ways. Jiang then exchanged 4,109 yuan of Zhuang tickets at Baodayu Money Shop, which he had been dealing with, and went to the Shanghai Bank to wait. Before long, Rong also arrived. There was also a man in a suit who arrived later. Rong introduced him and pointed out that the man in the suit was Mr. Pan, the owner of Jifeng Iron Firm, and now he could hand over the money so that he could exchange the bill of lading to pick up the goods. Jiang believed it to be true at the time and handed the Zhuang tickets to Rong Changnian, who handed them over to Pan. Pan took the tickets and entered the glass door of the Shanghai Bank's inner room. Jiang and Rong waited outside. Because they had been waiting for a long time and did not see Pan come out, Jiang asked Rong, and Rong's words were ambiguous. Finally, he said that Pan had returned to the store, and he would inquire by phone. He went to the telephone room of the bank together. Unexpectedly, in a blink of an eye, Rong also disappeared. It was then that Jiang realized that he had been deceived, and he quickly telegraphed his comprador Qin Ziwei for instructions. Qin heard the report and telegraphed Baodayu Money Shop to stop payment. The shop claimed that the Zhuang tickets had been checked and cleared by Tongqing Money Shop, and 3,000 yuan had been transferred. Qin then went to Jifeng Iron Firm with Mr. Jiang Ruifu to investigate and learned that all the statements made by Rong were false. He immediately went to Tongqing Shop to inquire. It was said that the Zhuang tickets were entrusted to them by Shengtai Shop, which had been dealing with them, to collect on their behalf. Later, it was found that Shengtai Shop was located at No. 1308 Liuhefang, Roberts Road, and was opened by Zhu Fuxiang (also known as Zhu Lirang), the general affairs section of the Fuxin Tobacco Company, who was from Wuxi. He also went to Zhu's place to investigate and reported to the General Patrol Room, ordering Chinese detective Song Bingzheng and Western detective Beibeining to investigate. He then petitioned the First Special Court to issue a summons. Yesterday morning, Zhu Fuxiang, the owner of Shengtai Shop, was summoned to the Second Criminal Court. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, stated the above situation, and said that according to Jiang Ruifu's statement to the police station, the defendant Zhu Fuxiang was the person who impersonated Mr. Pan, the owner of Jifeng Iron Firm. Now Rong Changnian has escaped without a trace, and the police station has petitioned your court to issue an arrest warrant. The defendant was prosecuted according to Article 363 of the Criminal Law. According to Jiang Ruifu's confession, he was deceived, and he pointed out in court that Zhu Fuxiang was the person who impersonated Mr. Pan at that time, so he was indeed a joint fraud. According to Qin Qianwei's younger brother Qin Qianxiang's complaint about everything, the defendant Zhu Fuxiang denied impersonating the owner of Jifeng Firm, and said that he had been dealing with Rong Changnian for several years. Shengtai Shop was set up by him personally for the purpose of dealing with shame. Because Rong had discounted Zhuang tickets with him several times in the past, he gave Rong 800 yuan in cash and another 3,000 yuan withdrawn from Tongqing Money Shop, and another 300 yuan was deducted from Rong's old debt. He did not know about the fraud. He hired lawyer Jiang Baoli to defend him. Judge Huang verified the confession and ordered Zhu to pay a guarantee of 10,000 yuan and reschedule the trial in seven days.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Rose Garden New Village Popularization Plan <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Founder Zhang Yongnian Reported to the Press Yesterday</p>
<p>Pay a Deposit of Several Hundred Yuan to Order a House</p>
<p>Zhang Yongnian, the founder of Rose Garden New Village of China New Village Construction Society, hosted a banquet for the local press and picture periodical editors at Yizhixiang Western Restaurant last night. More than a hundred people, including reporters from various newspapers and editors from various picture periodicals, attended the banquet, and the host and guests enjoyed themselves. In recent years, Shanghai has experienced soaring land prices and expensive rents, which have been increasing day by day. Residents spend more than one-third of their income on rent, and it is still difficult to obtain a comfortable and clean house. As for purchasing land to build their own houses, it is even beyond the ability of ordinary people. Therefore, housing has become a very serious problem. Mr. Zhang is planning to solve the housing problem for the public. He specially founded Rose Garden New Village in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The first person to create new village construction publicly, since the plan was made public, has been deeply appreciated by people from all walks of life. The first step of its plan, to build houses, has reached its quota, and bidding for construction has already begun. It is expected to be completed in August of next year. However, the implementation of the first step of the plan is to open up a new environment for the middle class, and those who love new village life still regret that it cannot fully meet the economic capabilities of most people. Therefore, they all request the society to</p>
<p>Popularize the benefits of the new village letters and those who personally go to the society to negotiate, there must be dozens of cases every day. The society has always had three standards for new village construction as its goal: (1) For the perfection and detail of the equipment, all public equipment such as transportation, water and electricity, security, market, park, grand auditorium, etc., and public undertakings such as education, health, cooperation, entertainment, etc., are repeatedly concerned; (2) For the economic and comfortable design, the base is square and neat, the residence is perfect, the road is flat and wide, the planting must be pleasing to the eye, and the management is meticulous. One is</p>
<p>Easy to order and build Residents can consider their own economic capabilities, agree on a deadline, and pay monthly, similar to after the rent expires, they can also obtain the ownership of the ordered building and real estate. The society has now decided to follow the needs and requirements of the majority of people in society and contribute the second step of the popularization plan that has been planned for a long time to the society in advance. It is scheduled to be officially announced on the 27th of this month. The various designs of this popularization plan are all for the residents.</p>
<p>Think from their perspective In addition to ordering, there are also fixed-building leasing methods. With a down payment and a deposit of several hundred yuan, you can order a house. The base and house are twice as large as the Shanghai lane-style house, and the monthly rent is only fifty or sixty yuan. If you pay the rent for up to ten or twelve years, you can obtain the ownership of the real estate. From now on, people from all walks of life can solve their housing problems forever in the most economical and simple way. How happy is this! After hearing this report, the people in the press felt that the society was indeed based on the spirit of service, and the intention of reforming the unlimited rental system for people was excellent. Xu Zhuodai, Qian Cangshuo, Mi Xingru, and Yan Duhe, etc., stood up and gave speeches to encourage and encourage them. It was not until about 9:00 pm that they all dispersed happily. The society's new address is No. 1918 Aiduya Road (opposite Nanjing Grand Theater), telephone number 94965.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Barely a Husband and Wife in Name, Never any Bedroom Pleasure <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yao Yanping and Xu Jingqing Have Deep Antipathy</p>
<p>Repeated Lawsuits and Reconciliations, Now Sued Again</p>
<p>Yao Yanping, the young owner of Yitai Money Shop in Tilanshui, married Xu Jingqing as his wife, which has been six years. Because Yao's body is hunched over, and there is some kind of relationship in physiology, it is difficult for Xu to be with her spouse for a long time. She only has the name of husband and wife, and has never had the pleasure of the bedroom, making her great youth wasted in vain. The woman harbored this grievance, and had no one to tell her, causing antipathy to gradually sprout between the couple, which deepened over time. This summer, Xu Jingqing decided to sacrifice her false name in exchange for real benefits, so she hired a lawyer to sue her husband Yao Yanping, saying that she could not bear the abuse, and requested permission to separate and order the defendant to pay alimony of 100,000 yuan. After the first trial of the First Special District Local Court, the plaintiff lost the case. Xu refused to accept it and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. After being summoned by the branch court, she was gently persuaded to reconcile. At that time, Xu was unable to insist because of the judge's earnest persuasion, and her hidden feelings were difficult to express, so she had to endure the pain and withdraw the appeal and agree to return to her husband's house to live together. However, she made an angry statement in court, saying that she could not win a lawsuit in the Yangjian court, and she would definitely fight a lawsuit in the Yinjian court in the future. Yao Yanping's mother and his uncle Yao Jinshu heard Xu's angry words and were deeply afraid that Xu would return in the future and cause an unexpected tragedy. Therefore, although Yanping's mother-in-law personally sent her beloved daughter back to the Yao family twice, Yao Jinshu and Yanping's mother refused to accept her, making the mother and daughter travel back and forth in vain. Her antipathy towards Yao Yanping became more and more profound, so she continued to work hard and hired a lawyer to sue Yao Yanping in the First Special Court, requesting an order to perform the obligation of cohabitation, and requesting an order for Yao Jinshu to allow Yanping to live with Xu. Yanping also hired a lawyer to write to the civil mediation office of the court, requesting mediation for divorce because his wife did not respect the elders. Yesterday morning, Judge Yu Changzi opened a court hearing for Xu's lawsuit against Yao. Neither plaintiff nor defendant personally surrendered to the court. After the lawyers from both sides stated their cases, Judge Yu ordered a rescheduling to December 6th at 9:00 am to summon the plaintiff and defendant to court for another hearing.</p>

<p>Since the Municipal Public Works Bureau took over the Shanghai South Public Bus, its business has been quite developed. Among them, the No. 3 Circular City Road is the most crowded with passengers, so since its opening, there has been a monthly surplus. Now, in order to expand its business and facilitate transportation in the new western district, the bureau is planning to open new public bus routes. One route runs from Xieqiao via Fangxie Road to Laoximen, passes through Zhaoji Road and exits Dadongmen, along Zhonghua Road, via Xiaodongmen, via Dongmen Road, Wai Malu, Lujiabang Road, and returns to Xieqiao. Another route runs from Dapuqiao to Xieqiao, along Zhaozhou Road, Heping Road, Zhonghua Road, Li Malu, and Lujiabang Road, and then returns to Dapuqiao. As for the vehicles that should be prepared for these two routes, they will still be ordered from foreign merchants in the same way as in the past, and the goods will be delivered first, and then the companies will be paid in installments. If they cannot be driven within the year, they will definitely be realized next spring.</p>

<h3 id="e115">The Invention of "Pearl Light" <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Westerners Praise Him as Another Edison</p>
<p>Since the invention of "Pearl Light", it has not been a month. Chinese and Western chemists praised it first, and engineering experts scrambled to order it, hoping to be the first to win the honor of browsing by Shanghai people. The other day, Mr. Lu Buxian, the director of the factory, brought a sample lamp "Dragon Shape" to the museum for a test projection. After the lamp was turned on, the dragon suddenly became active, tumbling and flying, with colorful lights and countless changes. The light reflected in front of the eyes, no different from the clouds and sunset, was more interesting than a movie projected on the screen. If it is designed in the signs and windows of shops and markets, it is equivalent to showing a movie, and its appeal is conceivable. It is a powerful tool for advertising in the new era. Because of its complex structure, it consumes very little electricity. The huge advertising power and the cheap price are far beyond the reach of the "Nian Tai Lamp". After the experts tested it, they were all surprised to see another Edison in the world, and they scrambled to order it, which shows that foreign merchants attach great importance to advertising itself. For the convenience of contact, the factory has specially set up an office at No. 405 Jinxing Building, Henan Road, Ningbo Road, telephone number 91562, with sample lamps and brochures. They will send someone to show the test as soon as they receive the notice.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Alcohol of the American Dragon Factory in the National Goods Games Market Was Inspected and Seized <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Arrested Employees Have Been Released on Bail, and the Alcohol Has Not Been Returned</p>
<p>The Factory Believes That Power Has Been Abused and Will Express Itself</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency said that the 6th National Goods Games hosted by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Commerce Group in the Penglai Market, where manufacturers rent booths to display and promote, had the American Dragon Fragrance Cosmetics Factory, which presented the Dragon Head brand domestic alcohol approved for tax exemption, to participate, and set up a booth in the business market. Unexpectedly, yesterday, inspectors from the Nanshi Foreign Wine Tax Inspection Office arrested 45 bottles of alcohol displayed in the factory, along with employee Qian Keyin, and fabricated confessions to force Qian Keyin to sign. The confession contained words such as "another branch company is set up in the Penglai Market to promote alcohol" and claimed that Qian Keyin would be sent to the Public Security Bureau for punishment. Later, Cao Zhigong, the host of the business market group, and others rushed to the Foreign Wine Tax Inspection Office on Bansongyuan Road and brought Qian Jun out. The 45 bottles of alcohol have not been returned. It is reported that the alcohol of the American Dragon Factory has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to be exempt from tax in accordance with the domestic goods made by machinery. Moreover, the business market group is hosted by the Social Affairs Bureau to promote domestic goods. Even if it has not been approved for tax exemption, it should also be exempted. The inspectors of the inspection office arrested the employees and goods in the business market group, fabricated confessions, and forced them to sign. Therefore, the American Dragon Factory will have a serious statement in the near future.</p>

<p>Li Changdong, of the Nanxiang Tax Police Bureau, is the Most Suspected</p>
<p>More Than One Hundred Letters Were Seized at His Mother's House</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Salt Affairs Audit Office recently discovered that someone was spreading written rumors outside, defaming the reputation of the office, and that important official documents, which officials had not yet known, had been leaked to the outside world. It conducted a thorough investigation. Recently, Zhang Qingcheng, the director of the Nanxiang Su Five Districts Salt Affairs Office, found that Li Changdong, the former doorman of the Audit Office who is now working in the Nanxiang Tax Police Bureau, was indeed highly suspected. He was immediately arrested and considerable evidence was seized. It was also learned that Li's mother lived at No. 66 Hongxiangli, Xinzha Road, Public Concession. He asked the First Special District Court to issue a search warrant and went to investigate and copy together with detectives from the Xinzha Police Station yesterday. One hundred and twenty-two letters were seized. Yesterday morning, the police station presented the letters to the First Special Court for disposition. Judge Cheng Tingqi and Chief Prosecutor Xiang Zhejun took their seats in the Criminal Court No. 8. Zhang Tianyin, the police station lawyer, stated that the police station had not yet examined whether the letters defamed the Audit Office. Now the Audit Office requested that the letters be taken away. How should it be handled? He asked the court to decide. Zhang Qingcheng and Liu Guojun, the director of the Second District of the Tax Police, went to court to declare that the letters were indeed defamatory and requested permission to take them back for investigation. If there were any criminal facts, they would also be transferred to the local court for trial. After consultation between Judge Wu and Chief Xiang, they decided to temporarily store the letters and wait for the official documents to arrive at the court for verification.</p>

Mr. Feng is intelligent and patriotic, and is highly regarded by his peers. Recently, deeply angered by unscrupulous merchants selling enemy goods and acting as accomplices, he became depressed and suddenly embraced passive thoughts. On the afternoon of the 21st of this month, he took his luggage and left with his colleague Zhuo Xiangyu (from Ningbo) without telling anyone. The company realized this the next morning, but could not find him anywhere. In addition to notifying his family, they also reported it to the police station and requested an investigation. Mr. Feng's family was shocked upon hearing the news and immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau to help find him. As of today, three days have passed with no trace of him.</p>

Yao's daughter, Hui Fang, took the opportunity to run out the back door and reported it to the Chinese police officer on duty and Chinese detective Wang Chengying, who arrived and apprehended the robber Yu. He was taken to the Jiaxing Road Police Station for questioning. It was learned that they had gathered in a house at No. 63 Tangshan Road beforehand.

<p>The Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, and Beijing-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, following an order from the Ministry, held a conference on improving the Shanghai-Beiping through train service at the Shanghai North Station from the 14th to the 16th of this month. The resolutions have now been finalized and were announced yesterday morning. A summary is recorded below: (1) Each railway should submit blueprints of the structure and equipment of the through train carriages for reference. Resolution: (A) Passed, exchange blueprints. (B) The standard for carriage equipment should be based on neatness, aesthetics, practicality, and economy. After each railway exchanges blueprints and studies them in detail, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway will convene a meeting to discuss them. (2) The berth numbers should be re-numbered. Resolution: The berth numbers should be numbered by each railway, but each carriage must be different and odd numbers should be for the upper berth and even numbers for the lower berth to avoid misunderstandings.

(7) The uniforms of the conductors in first, second, and third class should be the same for each railway. Resolution: Passed. All will use white long uniforms with no piping and blue and white international numbers embroidered on the left chest from left to right. (8) After the Beijing-Shanghai train of the Shanghai-Beiping through train arrives at Nanjing Station, it is proposed to reduce the number of third-class carriages by one to make it uniform and save power. Resolution: The number of carriages should remain the same as the current method. If charter carriages are used, each railway should negotiate at any time.

The ticket inspector should be responsible for supervision. (13) When the Shanghai-Beiping through train arrives at major stations, many people picking up passengers enter the train to find them, causing disorder. How should this be restricted to maintain order? Resolution: (A) Passengers getting off the train should be notified of the location of each class of carriage by the ticket inspector. (B) Equipment should be provided on the platform to indicate the location of each class of carriage. (C) People picking up passengers must wait until passengers get off the train before boarding. (14) How should the segmented charging method for tea fees on each train be thoroughly implemented to prevent malfeasance? Resolution: The tea fee is set at two corners per segment (but the Beijing-Shanghai line is set as a small ocean due to special circumstances). It should be collected from passengers all at once, and no other fees should be charged to passengers. (15) Parcel tickets should be issued for the Shanghai-Beiping through train to facilitate passengers. Resolution: The Shanghai-Beiping through train does not handle ordinary parcel transportation. However, passengers carrying typewriters, wireless radios, and instruments may have tickets issued by the transportation department of the departing railway after consideration of the circumstances, and the passenger ticket number should be noted. (16) Improving the method of selling sleeper berths. Resolution: (A) The method of allocating compartments will remain the same, but Tianjin-Pukou will do its best to assist Beijing-Shanghai at any time. (B) The sleeper berth chart should be printed and used according to the format set by the Ministry. (17) When theatrical groups board the Shanghai-Beiping through train, their luggage should be allowed to be transported as baggage. Resolution: The luggage of theatrical groups should not be transported as baggage. However, if it is necessary to carry it with them or in special circumstances, it may be handled in accordance with the parcel ticket resolution. (18) The three points from the Ministry of Railways Joint Transportation Office regarding the improvement of the Shanghai-Beiping through train are proposed for discussion and resolution.

<h3 id="e123">News from the Red Swastika Society's Disaster Relief Efforts <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Red Swastika Society is actively carrying out disaster relief efforts in various provinces. The Society's recent work is summarized below.</p>
<p>Hebei and Henan Disaster Relief: The Red Swastika Society previously reported that Changyuan, Puyang, and Hua County in Henan were repeatedly hit by floods, and the situation was serious. It sent special commissioners to provide relief. Now that the severe winter has arrived, the people in the disaster areas have no clothes or food, and the situation awaiting food is even more tragic than before. Another relief team was organized, and President Zhang Zehao was elected as the team leader, leading more than ten staff members and carrying 7,000 yuan in relief funds, 2,000 sets of relief clothing, and relief food and medicines to Changyuan, Puyang, Hua County, and other places to implement relief.</p>
<p>Liyang Disaster Relief: Liyang is the most severely affected area in the Jiangsu Province disaster area. The Southeast Branch of the Red Swastika Society and the Joint Office previously recommended relief commissioners Shi Xiding and Li Tianzhen to investigate the county. The investigation has now been completed and relief tickets have been issued. The first district has 22 townships, with 13,503 large mouths and 15,061 small mouths receiving relief. The second district has 25 townships, with 19,320 large mouths and 17,789 small mouths. The third district has 18 townships, with 17,010 large mouths and 17,675 small mouths. The fourth district has 13 townships, with 18,468 large mouths and 16,694 small mouths. The fifth district has 31 townships, with 26,471 large mouths and 24,439 small mouths. The sixth district has 15 townships, with 6,051 large mouths and 7,844 small mouths. In total, the county has 6 districts and 124 townships, with 100,853 large mouths and 100,502 small mouths. In total, there are 201,355 mouths. The relief standard is 10 catties of noodles for each large mouth and 5 catties of noodles for each small mouth. It is estimated that 37,000 bags of flour are needed, totaling more than 60,000 yuan. In addition to the 35,000 yuan raised by the Red Swastika Society, the Zhiyuan Dharma Assembly, and the Wuxi Puren Charity Association, the Chinese and Foreign Charity Relief Association allocated 15,000 yuan. Mr. Li Shoushan, Song Hanzhang, Lu Bohong, and Gu Jisheng each donated 1,000 yuan. In total, the amount of relief funds raised is still more than 10,000 yuan short.</p>
<p>Haining Disaster Relief: Red Swastika Society relief commissioners Zhao Yulin and Jin Jianguang reported that the investigation of Haining disaster relief is nearing completion, but the drinking water of the people in the disaster area is unclean and many are infected with diseases. They have no money for treatment and most of the able-bodied men have died, which is very pitiful. The society has specially sent Dr. Zhu Xusheng, leading two assistant doctors, carrying various medicines, to set up a temporary clinic for a period of two months. They have already departed on the morning train.</p>
<p>Lihuang Disaster Relief: Zhou Jueci and Jiang Guangji, relief workers from the Red Swastika Society sent to Lihuang, Anhui, reported to the Shanghai General Office by letter, stating that after arriving in Lihuang, they contacted Brigade Commander Zheng and County Chief Xing and other agencies and immediately began an investigation. The county is mostly deserted, and wolves enter the city every night to eat people. More than 20 people have been eaten in the Wang clan ancestral hall refugee shelter. 60 people have been eaten in the fifth district, and 70-80 people have been eaten in the sixth district. More than 100 people whose names are unknown have been eaten by wolves. Most of the refugees are suffering from malaria, and they die after the second onset. The suffering compatriots either die from wolves or from malaria. The tragic situation is heartbreaking.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Seafarer Groups Telegraph Request for Re-examination of Song-Han Pilots <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Those with Superior Experience and Ability Should be Guaranteed</p>
<p>Pilot Qualifications Should Not be Arbitrarily Cancelled</p>
<p>The seafarer groups, including the Maritime Allied Righteousness Association, the Southern Jun'an Sailors Association, the Yan Ying Southern Society, and the Maritime Helmsman Carpenter Mutual Aid Association, submitted to the Central Executive Committee, etc., stating: Nanjing Central Executive Committee, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Communications, Greetings. Recently, it was heard that the Song-Han pilot area's pilot management committee violated the purpose of its establishment, favored foreign pilots, and destroyed the few remaining Song-Han pilots. It increased pilotage rates, curbed the development of domestic shipping, and aroused the Shanghai Shipping Association to strike, causing a huge wave that has continued to this day. The Song-Han pilots mostly have experience. If the pilot management committee intends to take back the Tongsha pilotage rights and ban foreign pilots, and hold an examination, it should refer to the situation of national shipping and the experience and ability of each pilot, and test them technically, check their physical condition, and assess their qualifications. They should not be questioned based on the depth of academic theory. Pilotage is very important to national shipping and national defense. If those with superior physical condition, experience, and ability should be guaranteed their jobs in accordance with the law. Even those who are slightly inferior should be given a deadline to remedy their deficiencies and seek ways to make up for their studies in order to cultivate specialized pilot technicians. If senior crew members such as pilots are trampled on, then it will be even more difficult to protect the lower-level crew members such as firemen, sailors, and helmsmen of the Association. The death of the rabbit grieves the fox, and the loss of the lips chills the teeth. The Association telegraphed the Council and Ministries to request that the pilot management committee change the examination method, conduct a re-examination, and not arbitrarily cancel pilot qualifications, destroy Chinese people, and open the door to foreign covetousness. The telegram is full of anticipation.</p>

You should instruct to receive it from the Finance Bureau at that time and report the use to the Association for verification and forwarding to the government for record, this is important, etc. Correspondingly recorded and replied to the letter, I hope you will check and handle it.</p>

<h3 id="e128">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Permission to Send Representatives to Participate in the Rickshaw License Meeting <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating: A presentation for the matter of requesting a presentation, on the 22nd of this month, the Rickshaw Industry Association sent a letter stating, "After reviewing the case, it was found that 64 rickshaw licenses have been in dispute over the issue of leasing. The details have been described and submitted to the Research Association of the Municipal Government on Rickshaw Issues through your Association. Please give it careful handling. After investigating this case, it was found that the dispute was caused by the car merchants Ju Ganxin and Song Fengming, etc., who requested to lease the licenses. The Association invited representatives from both parties to the meeting to discuss the matter, and the method of disposing of the public licenses was resolved. The parties jointly submitted a letter to the Municipal Public Works Bureau, expressing their compliance with the method set by the Association. However, since October, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has withheld this public license for more than a month. The losses of the dozens of poor car merchants who rely on this to make a living are unimaginable, and the number of rickshaw pullers who have lost their jobs as a result has reached more than 300. Their livelihoods are hopeless, and the situation is very pitiful. Although the Association has repeatedly stated the process of resolving the dispute and requested that the livelihoods of the poor be taken into consideration and that the original state be restored, it has not been approved by the Bureau. Recently, the four licenses of Zhang Hengfeng, which were extracted from the 68 magnetic licenses owned by the public in the 17th year of the Republic due to the reduction of the number of cars, will be further withheld. After reviewing the Bureau's handling of this case, it seems to be demanding and has failed to live up to the government's intention to maintain commercial difficulties and help the poor. Recently, it has been heard that the Bureau has suggested to the Municipal Government that it intends to suspend these licenses, which is even more alarming. (Omission) In addition to submitting a request to the Municipal Government to maintain the original state and to issue business permits as soon as possible, the Association has truthfully submitted a request to your Association to submit to the Municipal Government. At the Municipal Government meeting or the Research Association on Rickshaw Issues, when discussing the disposition of these licenses, please allow two representatives from your Association, together with two representatives from the Association, to attend and state the actual truth and the opinions of the car merchants, so as to contribute to the adoption of opinions and avoid misunderstandings, so that the license disputes that affect the business of car merchants and the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers can be handled with caution and satisfaction. The car industry will be very fortunate, etc. The Association found that the Association sent a letter previously, and the Association submitted a request to your Government on October 22 to forward it to the Research Committee on Rickshaw Issues for careful handling. So far, no reply has been received. According to the news obtained by the Association, the Public Works Bureau insists on canceling these licenses, which makes the business situation even more precarious. It is believed that if these car licenses are, as proposed by the Association, rented to poor car households by the Association and the rent is allocated to the educational expenses of the industry, it will be of benefit to the poor car households and will also take care of the educational foundation of the industry. It does not seem to conflict with the Municipal Government and the Public Works Bureau's main purpose of maintaining public welfare. According to the previous letter, it is appropriate to prepare a document to submit to your Government for review. It is hoped that when the Research Committee on Rickshaw Issues discusses the method of handling these car licenses, the Association will be allowed to send two representatives to attend and state their contributions, so as to use the small efforts for adoption. It is really for the public's convenience, etc.</p>

<p>Wang Jingqi, the former envoy to Belgium, and Huang Jiahui, the Executive Director of the Chinese National Anti-Opium Society, hosted a public banquet at the New Asia Restaurant the other day for Nan Wen, the Abbot of the Saint Andrew's Abbey in Belgium, a leader of the Catholic Church in Belgium. Attendees included Prince Yalenbile of Qinghai, Minzhu'er Hutuktu Living Buddha, the Grand Zen Master of Pure Illumination, Quiet Cultivation, Great Compassion, and Protecting the Nation, a large Catholic priest from Belgium, Father Yang, and prominent figures from various sectors, including Li Denghui, Lu Bohong, Wang Xiaolai, He Dekui, Cai Rudong, Zhong Ketuo, Mrs. Guo Bingwen, Ms. Ding Shujing, Mrs. Huang Jiahui, Ms. Zheng Wen Siying, Huang Jianzhong, Lu Yingen, Zhang Tianze, Wu Youqian, Chen Dongxi, and Hu Zhongzhe, totaling over fifty people. During the banquet, Huang Jiahui delivered a speech, stating that Abbot Nan Wen has always been sympathetic to our country. Former Premier Lu Zhengxiang of our country practiced monasticism in the abbey presided over by Abbot Nan Wen. Previously, the Chinese National Anti-Opium Society requested the Pope in Rome to issue an order for global believers to participate in anti-opium efforts, which was facilitated by Abbot Nan Wen's assistance. Now, taking advantage of Abbot Nan Wen's visit to China, we offer a simple banquet to express our welcome. Abbot Nan Wen then gave a speech on the relationship between the anti-opium movement and religion, praising the spirit of the Chinese National Anti-Opium Society in promoting the prohibition of opium and Ambassador Wang's reputation in Europe. The speeches by the guests and host were translated by Dr. Zhang Tianze in both Chinese and French. The gathering continued until late at night before dispersing. It is said that Abbot Nan Wen will be traveling to Sichuan.</p>
<h3 id="e130">General Assembly of the French Concession Boiled Water Shop Trade Association <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the French Police's Obstruction of the Association's Organization</p>
<p>Resolving to Issue a Declaration and Send Representatives to Petition</p>
<p>There are a total of 280 boiled water shops in the French Concession. Although there is a trade association, many have not joined, leading to disorderly business practices and a lack of uniformity. Therefore, Dong Wenwei and other members of the trade initiated the establishment of the Second Special District Office of the Shanghai Boiled Water Shop Trade Association. The trade association appointed Dong Wenli as the director of the office, and the application was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval and filing. It was also permitted to be established by the French Consul General. Since the office began its operations, all members of the trade have enthusiastically joined, and it was declared established last month. After the establishment, all members of the trade agreed to abide by the trade regulations, and the office supervised the production of water ladles to be distributed to the members and stipulated a unified water price method, which was scheduled to be implemented on a specific date. However, the French police, due to a misunderstanding regarding the distribution of water ladles and the unified water price, prevented the distribution and ordered the office to be closed. Upon hearing the news, all members of the trade were extremely indignant. Therefore, at 2 PM yesterday, an emergency meeting of all members of the trade was held at the Zizhu Temple on Zhaozhou Road in the Chinese territory. More than 110 members of the trade attended. The trade association appointed Standing Committee member Li Shengxian, representatives of the First Special District Office Sheng Jinggui, Wang Zhitian, Fang Guangwen, etc., to attend and provide guidance. After the formalities were completed, Li Shengxian was publicly elected as the chairman, and Dong Wenli reported on the entire process. The following measures were decided upon: (1) Fifteen people, including Ji Zihe, Chen Bingnan, Dong Wenli, and Cheng Peizhang, were nominated as representatives to petition various party and government agencies on a regular basis, requesting them to negotiate with the French authorities. (2) A request was submitted to the trade association to forward it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for negotiation. (3) Pending a resolution, the office would be temporarily set up inside the Zizhu Temple. (4) The reasons for the French authorities' revocation of the organization were investigated, citing oppression of the trade. In addition to the trade association negotiating on the basis of reason, the representatives would also jointly declare to the French authorities that there was no oppression and request restoration. (5) Reorganizing business operations was a matter for the trade itself and had nothing to do with public order. Since it did not violate the law, nor was there any oppressive behavior, a declaration should be issued, asking all industries to uphold justice and provide sympathetic assistance. (6) The office would notify members of the trade to bring their seals to the association to collect the water ladles. (7) The issue of unified water prices would be notified again and implemented on a specific date after the water ladles were distributed. (8) The various handling processes would be reported to the trade association for forwarding to the relevant party and government agencies for filing. (9) If the above measures were interfered with by foreigners and could not be implemented, it was decided that all would express their determination to sacrifice everything. (10) A fee of one yuan was stipulated for the water ladle and one yuan for maintenance, with membership fees to be collected after the water price was unified. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were passed.</p>

<p>Social Affairs Bureau Orders Application to the Court</p>
<p>The shantytowns located between Wuzhen Road, Xinmin Road, and Xinjiang Road in Zhabei, in order to oppose the eviction by Ji Kunlin, the rent collector of Yu Chang Company, have repeatedly petitioned party and government agencies to request continued residence. During the last mediation, the company denied collecting rent. The Social Affairs Bureau previously replied to the shantytowns, stating: "Reply to Zhang Xiongji and others, representatives of the Wuzhen Road shantytowns, regarding a petition for relief from eviction by the landlord: Both petitions are noted. This case has been repeatedly summoned for questioning and attempted mediation. However, according to Song Deyi and others, representatives of the Yu Chang Real Estate Management Office, they have never collected rent from the shantytowns, resulting in a third party committing fraud and obtaining money. The case involves the judiciary, so you should apply to the court." With this reply, the shantytowns intend to file a lawsuit with the court after the Land Bureau's order confirms property rights.</p>

Afterwards, Ms. Ding Shujing stood up and reported that she was deeply grateful for the efforts of each team in this fundraising effort. At the team leader meeting held this Monday, considering that each team might not be able to collect all the donations in time, the originally scheduled closing ceremony on the 22nd was changed to next Friday (the 30th). Everyone still has one last week of effort, and we hope that everyone will continue to strive hard and achieve our goals. The closing ceremony is planned to be held at the National Women's Christian Association at 133 Yuanmingyuan Road. It is hoped that the chairmen of the conference, Mrs. Kong and Mrs. Wu, will both attend and preside over the ceremony and award prizes. The prizes are divided into two types: group and individual. For groups: (1) The three teams that raise the most money will be awarded prizes. (2) The three teams that recruit the most members will be awarded prizes. (3) Each team that raises more than 5,000 yuan will be awarded prizes. For individuals: (1) The three fundraisers who raise the most money among the fundraisers will be awarded prizes. (2) The three people who recruit the most members will be awarded prizes. (3) Each person who raises more than 1,000 yuan will be awarded prizes. By the time the meeting adjourned, the lights of thousands of homes were illuminating the dusk.</p>

<p>A Stray Bullet Wounds a Female Pedestrian</p>
<p>Xu Qisheng, a 19-year-old apprentice from Yong Sheng Chang tobacco and paper shop at 177 Huanghe Road in the French Concession, went to Wanxing Money Exchange on Avenue Paul Beau yesterday afternoon with 200 yuan to exchange for banknotes. After the exchange, on his way back, when he passed the intersection of Rue Chapsal and Rue Aiguebelle, two robbers suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, blocked his way, and threatened him with a gun, robbing him of all the banknotes in his possession. After obtaining the loot, the robbers fled into the Chinese territory of Fangbang Road via Nanyang Bridge. After being robbed, Xu was unwilling to give in and desperately chased after them, shouting loudly for help. The robbers, seeing Xu chasing closely, became angry and fired a shot behind them. A stray bullet accidentally hit a pedestrian in the leg. At this time, the police from both the Chinese and French territories heard the alarm and surrounded the area. Seeing that the situation was not good, the robbers threw their guns on Fangbang Road. At this time, the Chinese police had already chased after them with guns and arrested one of the robbers on the spot, taking him to the Ximen Branch for detention. According to the confession, his name is Liu Liansheng, from Qingjiang, and he is 28 years old. He admitted to the robbery without hesitation. The injured woman was taken to the hospital for treatment by the police.</p>

<p>A Rickshaw is Destroyed</p>
<p>Kong Linbo, a 31-year-old man from Taixing, has been running Hua Yuan firecracker workshop at 58 Puyudong Road outside the Dananmen in the South City. His business was usually doing well. Yesterday afternoon, around 1 PM, Kong handed over two large boxes of firecrackers to his partners, Xing Junlu and Gu Zhenping, to be moved to the front of the store, and hired Li Jiongming (22 years old), a Hainanese rickshaw puller, to transport them to western Shanghai for sale. Unexpectedly, when Xing Junlu and others were carrying the two boxes of firecrackers onto the rickshaw, the rickshaw toppled because of the unstable arrangement. More than 8,000 firecrackers inside the boxes exploded with a loud bang. At the same time, the rickshaw was instantly destroyed, and the rickshaw puller Li Jiongming and Xing Junlu, Gu Zhenping and other three people standing next to the rickshaw, their heads and faces were severely injured by the explosion. In an instant, they were covered in blood and screamed in agony. The police officer Zhang Yukun from the Xun Dao Street Police Station in charge of the area rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. In addition to sending Li and others to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, he took Kong Linbo, the owner of the Hua Chang firecracker workshop, to the station. After questioning by Director Jin, he was ordered to be detained for investigation and handling.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang Zhenzhi, a famous Cantonese official and the father of lawyer Wang Siji, was kind and gentle, and treated people with loyalty and forgiveness. In the early years of the Republic, he served as the Chief of Civil Affairs of Panyu County, Guangdong Province, where he achieved remarkable political achievements. After leaving office, he went to Shantou to take up the position of Superintendent of the Chao Hai Customs and Section Chief of the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, where he was highly respected. Because of his expertise in law, his integrity, his diplomatic skills, and his diligence in his duties, the consuls of various countries stationed in Shantou respected and feared him. In 1927, he retired due to old age. The National Government, in recognition of his contributions, granted him a lifetime pension, making him one of the few who were specially awarded such an honor. Unfortunately, he passed away at his residence in Shantou on the 9th of last month. Upon hearing the sad news, many people expressed their regret. Recently, lawyer Wang returned to Shanghai after handling the funeral. The Shanghai branch of the Lian Yi Association, the board of directors of the Weixing Girls' School, the Gonghe Le Sports Association, the Cantonese Lawyers' Association, the Alumni Association of the Schools for Officials' Dependents in Guangdong, and the Panyu Guildhall and other colleagues jointly initiated a memorial service to express their condolences. It was specifically scheduled for the 25th of this month at the Yushan Hall on Xin Guangdong Street, Zhabei, as the memorial venue. In recent days, the presentation of memorial scrolls and elegiac couplets has been extremely grand, and important party and government figures have all made donations.</p>

<p>Since Nanjing became the capital of the National Government, it has become the political center of the country, and its transportation, culture, economy, etc. have all advanced rapidly, and the changes in the economic situation have been even more dramatic. However, those who are enthusiastic about studying the capital's economy often suffer from the lack of good books as a basis for reference. The Economic Survey Institute of the Construction Committee, seeing this, sent personnel to conduct a detailed survey, and then carefully compiled and statistically analyzed the obtained materials. After spending two months, the entire book has been edited and completed, and was published and distributed yesterday. The content of the book is divided into chapters on land, population, municipal administration, transportation, industry and commerce, finance, etc. It covers everything about Nanjing's mountains, cultural relics, customs, and economy. With this book in hand, one not only feels like personally visiting the capital, taking in all the famous scenic spots and the great new buildings, but also clearly understands all the changes that have taken place in Nanjing in recent years. The sales outlets in this city are the Zuo Zhe Book Society on the Fourth Road, and the Modern Bookstore, at four silver dollars per copy.</p>

<p>Chapter Five: Fawning and Flattering with a Lamp to Illuminate a Withered Face, Driven by a Hungry Stomach, Applying Powder to Learn Debauchery</p>
<p>He was still hating him, but he didn't expect him to come to apologize first, so he also had a smile. In fact, Jia Duocai was a misunderstanding. He thought that Li Shilian had invited him on time because Zhu Yueying had come. When he arrived at the courtyard gate and saw Hu Saozi here again, he was even happier. In his excitement, he said that sentence to compliment Hu Saozi. He didn't expect that when he walked into Li Shilian's house, it was unexpected. Zhang Jiefu and Guo Dunpin were both here, especially with a woman in her twenties. In Xi'an, although this woman was very gorgeous, the powder on her cheeks was a little sticky, and the faint blue lines under her eyes were obviously unable to hide her haggardness. She seemed to know that Jia Duocai was a spender. Therefore, as soon as Jia Duocai entered the door, she stood up first, smiling to greet him. Jia Duocai was staring at her blankly when Li Shilian rushed forward and said: "Let me introduce you, this is Mr. Jia, this is Miss Yang, her courtesy name is Huanhua, friends call her Miss Wu, we also call her Miss Wu. She's also our fellow villager." Jia Duocai estimated her, originally thinking she was a woman of the streets, but now listening to Li Shilian's tone of introduction, it didn't seem like it, so he didn't dare to despise her too much, nodded and smiled: "Miss Wu is indeed our fellow villager, rare, which county?" Huanhua glanced at Guo Dunpin, then smiled and said the two words Changshu. Jia Duocai smiled: "That's even more coincidental, and it's the same county. But Miss Wu's accent has changed a bit, I think she's been away from her hometown for many years." Huanhua said: "I went to Shanghai at the age of nine, this year I left my hometown..." She said this, unwilling to say it in one breath, pondered for a long time with her head slightly tilted, and then smiled: "It's also been more than nine years." Li Shilian smiled at her: "Two nines are eighteen, is Miss Wu eighteen years old this year?" (72)</p>

<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>I once heard an old saying from the elders: There was a poor scholar who suffered a great tragedy in his childhood. He relied on his mother's chastity and upbringing to grow up. Later, he made progress and was able to hold a prominent position. However, when he was young, when he thought of his mother, enduring hardship and suffering, even in the deep of night, she was still rocking the spinning wheel with one hand and pulling the yarn with the other, spinning the yarn into skeins, accumulating enough to weave cloth, and then changing to another job. Therefore, his loud reading voice was often accompanied by the continuous sound of the yarn on his mother's spinning wheel. Even the neighbors heard this hard-working situation and said in their sleep, "Alas! This virtuous mother and good son, although they are suffering now, will definitely have a turnaround one day!" Later, he thought of his reading success as being due to his mother's spinning and reading with him under the lamp when he was young. Therefore, after he achieved his ambition, he imitated and made a small cart, which he placed in his ancestral hall as a permanent memorial. This is a story from my hometown. Also, in Shanghai, like it's Sipailou! There was a Mr. Chen who, it is said, initially carried a coppersmith's stand, but later he became rich and became a wealthy man. Therefore, his descendants could not bear to forget the original business of their ancestors, so they also made a very small coppersmith's stand and placed it in their ancestral hall. These are all rare and special souvenirs that were rarely heard of before. Hey! Yesterday, I was sipping tea at Tayin and heard my old friend Wang Wangnong say: There is a wonton seller in Jiangwan, but I don't know his name. He carries this stand every day, comes out in the afternoon, and doesn't go back until late at night. It is because the goods he brings in every day must be sold out before he can make a living. Unexpectedly, he worked hard and his business was not bad. Over time, he became a well-off family. Later, he changed to running a flour mill. He encountered opportunities for the rise and fall of flour prices. It can be said that when the time comes, everything goes well. In a few years, he became a wealthy man. Therefore, if you go to this town and ask, not only is his gate tall and big, but in his ancestral hall, there is also a wonton stand made of pure gold, and there are pots, firewood, bowls, and ladles, and the drawers are arranged in layers, everything is available. Therefore, I have recorded it so that we can see that there is no big or small occupation. If you can do it with perseverance and perseverance, you can accumulate wealth and become rich.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Flower Village <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Xiaoli</p>
<p>Flower Village, what a beautiful and poetic name this is. In everyone's ideal, it must be a "land of bliss," a "Shangri-La," or the villas of wealthy gentlemen. But in reality, it is not entirely so, or rather, there is a more heartbreaking page to it. Let me briefly describe it: Flower Village is located in Zhabei Pengpu Zhao's Garden, with more than 400 households, mostly engaged in the flower industry. The village is surrounded by flower fields and greenhouses, indeed a naturally secluded environment. This autumn, Mr. Huang Jingwan established a school there, designated as a rural education experimental zone, dedicated to improving the lives of farmers, experimenting with the education of "flowers." For the past two months, during our work breaks, we have often strolled through the fields, greenhouses, vegetable gardens, bamboo fences, and thatched huts; almost everywhere has our footprints. The farmers and their wives, laughing and chatting, have an unspeakable joy! We have gained a lot of information from approaching the farmers. The other day, I met a farmer friend who said, "I have been growing flowers for forty years, and every year it's always difficult to make ends meet, it's really hard!" I was surprised and asked him, "Why is that?" He said, "Most of our flowers are sold to foreigners, and even the seeds are imported from abroad. We buy the seeds at a very high price, and the price of the flowers is entirely determined by the foreigners. If the price is too high, the flowers won't sell." After hearing these words, I couldn't help but feel touched. Flower Village is truly a place for foreigners to plant flowers. The farmers are indirectly working as second-class foreign slaves. The flowers of Flower Village do not belong to the people of Flower Village, but to the foreigners. Flower Village has living flowers, but no right to enjoy them with a full stomach. Being so close to the Shanghai flower district, their lives are in the hands of foreigners. Alas, what else can be said!</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Deling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I was secretly wondering: up to this point, had the Empress Dowager felt the sadness of this desolate and melancholic scene that was unfolding here? Or perhaps she felt it, but was just enduring it, unwilling to show anything; or perhaps this feeling had not even registered on her nerves! Because no matter how healthy she was, her age was, after all, advanced, and older people's senses are not usually very sharp; plus, she was very tired today, so she would naturally be even more dull. But I was still a young person, and a particularly imaginative young person.</p>
<p>Because I was so good at imagining, my emotions were easily moved. Seeing this desolate and melancholic night scene at this moment, I couldn't help but regret that I shouldn't have followed the imperial entourage to the east, and I had a strong desire to return to Beijing immediately. However, I also understood my own nature very well; although this desire had arisen, it was only a fleeting impulse after being stimulated on a nerve, and it would never turn into a passionate demand; maybe after a night's sleep, I wouldn't think like this anymore tomorrow!</p>
<p>But no matter what, I couldn't force myself to be brave. It was like a child who had a terrible nightmare in bed; even after waking up, they would be so scared that they would cry. Now that such a ghostly hallucination had arisen in my nerves, it seemed as if there were many ghostly shadows, coming and going hazily in this vast and dimly lit ancient palace. And I kept explaining to myself: "It's true! There must be ghosts here! Just like there must be ghosts in the Imperial Palace in Beijing. In these two palace courtyards, over thousands or hundreds of years, who knows how many people have died inside; although their corpses have been transported out for burial, their souls will remain forever."

<h3 id="e150">Another Defense of Asparagus <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— (Bu Gu)</p>
<p>A few days ago, I read Mr. Nangongsheng's writing about asparagus in this publication, and I felt quite doubtful. Later, I read Fu Fusheng's defense, and I breathed a sigh of relief, but there is still a misunderstanding, so I might as well write it out for everyone to discuss.</p>
<p>As far as I know, asparagus is planted by dividing the roots. The stems grow in clumps, and the thin leaves are very similar to dill. The shoots are the tender buds of the plant in the soil. It is not guaranteed that they can be harvested after planting for a few months; it takes about a year or more. The method of cultivation is roughly the same as our cultivation of chives, but we don't bury the whole plant, we only raise the soil around the roots from time to time.</p>
<p>There is an agriculturist in Hangzhou, Mr. Tang, who has grown asparagus, which shows that this thing can also be grown domestically. Don't think that this is just an imported product and let it be imported every year! I hope that those who aspire to save the country through agriculture will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Notice: It is hereby announced that, according to a letter from Mr. Huo Xueming, the "Dragon Cave Transformation in Jinhua" by the Qixia Tower Master in the "Autumn Excursion Special Issue" of the 10th is plagiarized from his old work "Going to Shuanglong Cave" from April. This kind of despicable behavior is extremely hateful. In addition to canceling his remuneration, this is specially announced.</p>

<p>— Yinqiu</p>
<p>Nanjing is originally a place I have visited before. My first acquaintance with it was more than fifteen years ago, when I was a student taking entrance exams, full of ambition. After taking office, before the provincial capital was moved to Zhenjiang, I went to Beijing at least two or three times a year due to serving in social education and attending meetings for discussions. However, I have not visited in the past three years. This time, as a representative of the Suzhou Provincial Library, I went to Beijing to attend the joint meeting of vocational education teachers from provincial social education institutions. I had the opportunity to visit this old place and stay for two nights. It happened to be windy and rainy, and I came and went in a hurry. I only managed to compose ten short poems, playfully using the original rhymes of the Tang people, to record my feelings about the mud and snow!</p>
<p>First: Boarding the bus and meeting Zhi, using Zhang Yue's rhyme from "Late Period on the Shu Road." "Meeting an old friend on the bus, asking each other about the journey, you are heading to Liangxi, I am coming to Baixia City." November 11th, it happened to be Sunday. When taking the express train around 9 o'clock, there were more than 200 members of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo special party department visiting the mausoleum, and many tourists going to Yixing to explore the Shanjuan and Gengsang Caves. The car was extremely crowded. As soon as the car started, I suddenly saw Mr. Zhu Lezhou, the principal of the Zhongshan Physical Education School. He got off the bus in Wuxi, and we only asked each other about our journey.</p>
<p>Second: Looking at the distant mountains from the car, using Li Bai's rhyme from "Autumn Pu Song." "The fog gradually clears, the car travels unknowingly for a long time, distant mountains send off outside the window, red leaves are drunk and congealed with frost." When the car started, the clouds and fog were hazy, and the shadow of the Tiger Hill Pagoda was almost indistinguishable. It wasn't until Wuxi that the clouds gradually dispersed and the fog cleared, and the green mountains and red trees sent off the car window, which was a delight.</p>
<p>Third: Arriving in Beijing and lodging at Shushixuan, using Dai Shulun's rhyme from "Sanlv Temple." "The guesthouse is so refined and elegant, quietly hidden deep in a winding path, the small pavilion is inscribed 'Shushixuan', the garden is full of late chrysanthemums." From Xiaguan into the city, all are flat avenues. The car passed by many new buildings on both sides, splendid and magnificent, with a majestic atmosphere, like celestial palaces. Post offices and banks have all become towering buildings. The prosperity of the market around Sixiang Bridge is no longer what it used to be. The guesthouse is located in the Jiaotong Hotel on Zhongzheng Street, quiet in the midst of the hustle and bustle, and the location is quite elegant. In the garden, there is Shushixuan, the pond water ripples, and the chrysanthemum bushes are in full bloom, which is quite interesting.</p>
<p>Fourth: Night rain, using Wei Yingwu's rhyme from "Autumn Night Sending to Qiu Yuanwai." "The hotel is quiet late at night, just in time for a light rain, many green bamboos in front of the window, rustling and unable to sleep." Because tomorrow is the Prime Minister's birthday, there are many members of the mausoleum visit group in the hotel. There are many people and noises, and it is quiet late at night. Just as I was thinking of falling asleep, the sound of rain on the bamboo window was rustling. The traveler heard this and could not fall asleep.</p>
<p>Fifth: Going to the meeting, passing through Gongyuan Road, using Linghu Chu's rhyme from "Thinking of You." "Long time no see Gongyuan Road, many feelings of vicissitudes, the most unforgettable old event, once spent with the old man." On the 12th, braving the rain, I went to the Nanjing People's Education Center on Gongyuan Road, which is the meeting place. The roads along the way were being rebuilt, and the car drove around. When I arrived, I learned that most of the old friends in the meeting were scattered, and most of what I saw were new acquaintances. Recalling that I had twice accompanied the old Mr. Tao Xiaozhi to this place in the past, but he has already returned to Daoshan, I can't help but feel sad!</p>
<p>Sixth: After the meeting, going to a banquet at a restaurant, using Li Shizhi's rhyme from "Resigning as Prime Minister." "The virtuous gather with joy, the successful meeting shares a cup, the guests at the top of the windy and rainy building, mostly come from afar." On this day, during the meeting, the implementation of social education was discussed in great detail. After the meeting, the colleagues from the Nanjing People's Education Center publicly hosted the representatives from various institutions at a restaurant in front of the Confucius Temple. Among the guests, there were those from Nantong, Qingjiang, and other places, and the toasting and clinking of cups were quite a grand occasion for a time.</p>
<p>Seventh: Sitting in the rain by the guest window, using Qian Qi's rhyme from "Looking at Mount Lu from the River." Originally agreed to go with Sun Lu, but the muddy road cannot be climbed, listening to the rain by the guest window for a long time, sitting silently as a monk. Originally agreed that after the meeting, taking advantage of the Prime Minister's birthday, we would go together to respectfully visit the tomb; but because the rain did not stop, the road was muddy, and the stone steps on the tomb were high and steep, slippery and difficult to support, so it did not work out as desired, and it had to be left for another day.</p>
<p>Eighth: Gazing alone at the Qinhuai River, using Wei Yingwu's rhyme from "Answering Li Huan." "Making each other for not many days, happy to steal leisure from busyness, the new Qinhuai River rises green, tired birds want to fly back." In the evening, the rain stopped, and I strolled around Zhuque Road and Wuyi Lane. The scenery was as before, but the road administration was much better. I went to the small park on the Qinhuai River and saw that the lake water had risen green, and there was no longer the drought of the past. I bought a few kinds of food, preparing to return quickly tomorrow, because the thought of returning home was already urgent.</p>
<p>Ninth: Setting off early on the way home, using Luo Binwang's rhyme from "Farewell at Yishui." "Waking up from a dream, the sky is just dawning, putting on clothes and straightening my hat, few passengers boarding the car, the morning breeze is cold all the way." I got up at dawn, but the rain had not stopped. In the hazy sky, I took a car to Xiaguan. The car traveled very fast, and the morning breeze was very cold. The sky may be expected to clear up.</p>
<p>Tenth: Arriving home, using Cen Shen's rhyme from "Thinking of Chang'an Hometown on the Ninth Day of Military Service." "Don't say the journey is short, I left and returned in a hurry, arriving home as if after a long separation, my wife and children greet me with smiling faces." The car passed Zhenjiang, and the sky gradually cleared. When I arrived in Suzhou, the sun was shining brightly. Entering the city and arriving home, it was only past noon. Although it was only a short separation, my wife and children greeted me at the door, and the whole family spoke happily, like a distant guest returning home for the first time.</p>

<p>The 4th public race walking event organized by the Chinese Race Walking Association (the 3rd for women) has been widely praised by all sectors since its preparation, and has been guided and assisted by the Sports Association, which has enabled it to proceed smoothly. The entire route has been slightly changed. The men's race has been increased to 13 miles and 800 meters, and the women's race is 1.5 miles.

<p>Academic and Practical Exams</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education noted that while middle schools, such as regular senior and junior high schools, and normal schools have all held unified exams, physical education schools have not. Therefore, it has decided to hold a unified examination for physical education schools during this year's winter vacation. However, there are only a few physical education middle schools, mostly physical education normal schools with only senior high school level. Therefore, instead of calling it a physical education school unified exam, it is better to call it a physical education normal school unified exam (mostly senior high school level, with no junior high school level specialized schools). The subjects for this unified exam are different from those for regular middle schools. Regular middle schools only test academic subjects, while this physical education unified exam places equal emphasis on both academic and practical subjects. In addition to testing major academic subjects, practical skills such as track and field events and ball games must also be tested. The standards for the academic and practical exams are currently being discussed by the Director of General Education and the Physical Education Inspector. Once the standards are set, they will be announced and implemented.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Anhui Provincial Education Inspection Group Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Led by Yang Lian, the group visited the city center in the afternoon</p>
<p>An Anhui Provincial Domestic Education Inspection Group of forty people, led by Yang Lian, Director of the Anhui Education Department, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday afternoon. They are staying at the Oriental Hotel and plan to inspect Shanghai for four days before heading north. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Purpose of the Inspection In recent years, secondary education in the province has gradually reached a reasonable level. However, local education in various counties has no foundation to speak of. In recent years, floods and droughts have occurred frequently and without end. After the abolition of exorbitant taxes, there is no way to compensate for education funding, so that local education is almost bankrupt. The Anhui Provincial Department of Education plans to convene a local education administrative conference in December to deal with the current difficult problems in local education and to open up new ways for future improvement. Before the meeting, a domestic education inspection group will be organized to conduct on-site inspections in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Hebei, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces to learn from each other. The purpose of the inspection is: (1) To inspect new facilities and new methods in domestic local education as a reference for improving local education in the province; (2) To discuss with education experts from other provinces issues such as "how to properly select talent and methods," "how to compensate and broadly raise local education funding after the abolition of exorbitant taxes," and "how to integrate elementary education and social education and assist rural production" in the hope of obtaining appropriate solutions; (3) Based on the findings of the inspection, to study and implement the easiest, most economical, and most effective methods of promoting universal education, and to plan new ways for local education in the province.</p>
<p>Organization of the Entire Group The group is organized by Director Yang of the Education Department, leading principals of provincial normal schools, heads of provincial social education institutions, heads of local education, principals of elementary schools, and staff of the Education Department. The names are as follows (Leader) Yang (Members) Wang Dexi, Wang Jiayou, Wang Shulan, Fang Ming, Fang Yisheng, Jiang Xun, Wang Dequan, Shen Weixia, Shen Zixiu, Song Zhentao, Li Weitang, Li Daliao, Wu Wanzeng, Zhou De, Zhou Xueying, Zhou Huazhen, Jin Hui, Duan Zeyi, Hu Jiajian, Hu Heng, Tang Jie, Gao Chaozong, Ni Zide, Chen Dongyuan, Chen Diyong, Xia Zongyu, Xu Ningsheng, Cheng Mian, Shu Dejin, Xi Guoguang, Huang Lunshu, Huang Daolin, Zhang Dezheng, Zhang Fazhou, Yang Zizhen, Ye Weizhen, Ye Kunfu, Deng Shao, Liu Huaiyu, Tan Hegao.</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai The inspection group arrived in Shanghai at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Those who went to the station to welcome them included representatives from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Education Bureau, the China Children's Education Society, the Universal Education Association, the Commercial Press, the China Bookstore, the Dongshu Bookstore, and other institutions and organizations, as well as all the students of Anhui Middle School in this city, totaling several hundred people. After all the members of the group got off the train, they went to the Oriental Hotel on Tibet Road to rest.</p>
<p>Visiting the City The entire group had lunch and then, guided by Huang Jingwan and Xu Jian, visited various new constructions of the Greater Shanghai Plan in the city center. They first went to the Municipal Government for a week of visits, and then to the Education Bureau. Director Pan of the Education Bureau happened to be in Beijing on official business, and the head of the School Education Section, Chen Bai, represented him in receiving the group and reported in detail on the actual situation of education in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yesterday Evening's Banquet At 7:00 PM yesterday evening, the Commercial Press hosted a banquet at the Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road. In addition to all the members of the group, education experts Cai Yuanpei, Tao Xingzhi, Chen Bai, Chen Qingshi, Huang Renzhi, Jiang Wenyu, Tai Shuangqiu, Dai Zhiqian, Li Zhaohuan, Ma Zongrong, Shen Baiying, Sheng Langxi, Feng Maiying, and He Bocheng were also invited. During the banquet, the chairman, Wang Yunwu, first gave a welcome speech, followed by Yang Lian, the leader of the group, who gave a thank-you speech and briefly described the progress of education in Anhui Province and the origins and purposes of organizing the education inspection group to visit various provinces. Subsequently, Cai Yuanpei, Huang Renzhi, Tao Xingzhi, Jiang Wenyu, Tai Shuangqiu, Dai Jiqian, and Zong Rong successively gave speeches, elaborating on the promotion of universal education, the raising of local education funds, and the socialization of school education, making it a rare grand event in the academic circles of Shanghai. At 9:30 PM, the guests and hosts dispersed in joy.</p>
<p>Today's Itinerary It is said that the group is scheduled to visit the Shanhai Institute of Technology at 8:00 AM today, go to Zhabei to pay respects to the war dead in the afternoon, and the China Bookstore will host a banquet at the New Asia Restaurant in the evening.</p>
<p>Director Yang's Talk The reporter took the time to visit Yang Lian, Director of the Anhui Education Department, and asked about his feelings about this inspection. According to him, the impression of the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang was very good. (1) The personnel of the provincial governments of various provinces attach great importance to education, especially the difficult situation of local education funding after the abolition of exorbitant taxes, and they are doing their best to find ways to provide relief in order to maintain the normal progress of education. This spirit is particularly admirable. (2) Education personnel in various places are working hard to conduct various experiments on various educational issues in order to seek appropriate solutions. (3) The inspections in various places have provided many lessons for solving the educational problems in the province and have been very helpful. (4) The educational administrative authorities and educators in various places have provided convenience and hospitality during the inspections, which is especially appreciated.</p>

<h3 id="e166">The University Student Revival Movement Promotion Association Issues a Declaration on the Prohibition of Dancing <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Chen Ruhui and hundreds of other students from Shanghai Daxia University previously initiated the University Student Revival Movement Promotion Association and jointly organized students from various universities. They held an inaugural meeting a few days ago and elected Chen Ruhui, Zhou Dinghua, Zhang Fu, and others as preparatory committee members, which has attracted much attention from all parties. It is said that the association held its founding meeting at Daxia University at 7:00 PM on the previous day (the 22nd). Hundreds of people, including Zhou Xinliang, Yao Yunwen, Yang Su, Zhao Liansheng, Zhao Shiwei, Wu Jicang, and Jiang Weizu, attended. Many students from various universities went to participate spontaneously. Chen Ruhui was publicly elected as the temporary chairman, and Zhou Dinghua was the recorder. First, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting and the preparation process, omitting lengthy speeches. Immediately after, the declaration on the prohibition of dancing was read, totaling more than a thousand words, which was sincere and poignant. The whole audience listened quietly and respectfully. After reading it, there was thunderous applause, and it was reviewed and approved. Then, the constitution and other proposals were discussed briefly. As a result of the election, Chen Ruhui, Dong Zhengting, Zhou Dinghua, Zhang Fu, Jiang Weizu, Wu Jicang, Wang Kaiqiu, Pan Shuyi, Zhou Xinliang, and others were elected as directors with the most votes, and Zhao Shiwei, Yao Yunwen, Xu Shufan, Li Lianqun, Yang Su, and others were elected as alternate directors with the next most votes, and they are responsible for carrying out all the association affairs in the future. According to the declaration on the prohibition of dancing, it is enough to see the opinions of most self-respecting university students, which are specially recorded below. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai University Federation passed a resolution on October 17, which reads, "Strictly prohibit students from entering dance halls to dance. It is resolved to cooperate with the municipal government to jointly investigate and severely punish offenders." As for the implementation measures, it is said that "the municipal government will send police to patrol various dance halls in shifts. If students are found dancing in the hall, they will be arrested immediately. Each school will send personnel to the dance halls day and night to inspect in October. If students are seen, they will be reported to the school authorities by name and given severe punishment without leniency." Therefore, all parties are paying attention to "the prohibition of university students dancing has formed a major social problem. Considering the matter of dancing, it was originally the etiquette and music of the ancestors. In the time of Confucius, there was also the Gan Yu dance, and the dances of Europe and the United States are also noble arts, containing the meanings of entertainment, sports, and communication. In recent times, the European style has gradually spread to the East, and dance halls have sprung up one after another in various parts of our country, especially in Shanghai. In the midst of wine, red lights, and green lights, they embrace left and right and indulge in luxury, spending money on dancing to exchange for temporary carnal pleasure. The intention is different, and the abuses appear immediately, tempting people to fall, and nothing is more serious than this. At a time when the national crisis is serious and the nation is in danger, it is definitely not the time for the people of the country to feast, drink, and sing. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek promoted the New Life Movement, the whole country has followed it unanimously and spared no effort. "Not dancing with dancing girls" is suspended as one of the New Life covenants. Students of various universities in Shanghai have always known how to cherish themselves and can especially understand this meaning. They dare not slacken in the slightest. Fellow students have always been devoted to their studies and are afraid of this time of hardship. They are all diligent and unremitting. How can they be distracted by foreign affairs, let alone set foot in dance halls? However, there are occasionally those who do not know how to cherish themselves and set foot in them, even if they are spared, they are still a minority. It is thought that the various dance halls, can they fully know the occupation of the dancers? The exhalation and inhalation of the dancers every night, have they ever made accurate statistics? And how many university students enter and leave them? There is something that cannot be said here. The handsome young men in suits and leather shoes are not the symbol of university students, and those who frequent dance halls, such as the employees of foreign firms and companies, as well as the personnel of government agencies, also wear Western suits and leather shoes, which are not consistent with university students. It is not easy to distinguish them. It is also heard that general dandies and frivolous young men pretend to be university students to win the favor of dancing girls. There are not a few people either. According to this speculation based on reason, or is it the gene of social misunderstanding of the dancing of most university students? Those who are addicted to dancing halls, day and night, living in a drunken dream, are numerous, and those who set foot in them are university students (to be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e167">The Installation of Radio Transceivers on Airplanes <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenmin</p>
<p>In recent years, the use of radios on airplanes has been increasing daily. This is undoubtedly a bright page in the history of radio, and it is well worth our attention and research. I will briefly describe the latest installation methods below, which I think readers will also be happy to hear.</p>
<p>(1) Radio Equipment Used on Airplanes</p>
<p>The various radio equipment used on airplanes is not much different from that used on land. The only difference is the design issue, which makes it suitable for the special conditions of aviation. The most important thing is that the equipment must be extremely light in weight, and at the same time, the volume occupied must be extremely small, so that the airplane can carry it without difficulty. The structure of each part of the equipment must be extremely strong, so that it will not change shape even after the strong vibration of the airplane during driving. Therefore, each moving part should be absolutely locked in its position after being adjusted once. The base of the vacuum tube must be made of soft sponge-like rubber, and the radio box should also be placed on a cushion that is rich in vibration absorption, so as to minimize violent vibrations.</p>
<p>In addition to the above points, there is one most important point, that is, under no circumstances can sparks occur in any circuit, because the wings of the airplane are all coated with oilcloth or flammable paint. When the engine is started, there is often vaporized gasoline, which can cause the entire airplane to explode or burn when it touches a spark. Therefore, the exterior of all circuits should be wrapped with strong insulation, and all circuits should be tightly connected to the wooden frame of the fuselage to prevent vibration. All switches should be specially made to isolate the outside air (such as using a shell, etc.).</p>
<p>All circuits used on land can be applied to airplanes. However, the application of storage batteries is quite difficult, because the charging problem is difficult to carry out during the continuous driving of the airplane. Using a very small generator to obtain electrical energy has now proven to have very good results. This type of generator can be installed on the wings or behind the propeller. The air pressure generated when the fuselage moves forward is used to drive the small fan on the generator to generate friction electricity. The current generated can be adjusted by special vacuum tubes and resistors to maintain a constant transmission.</p>
<p>(2) Antenna Installation and Sound Reception and Transmission</p>
<p>There are about two types of antennas used for airplane radio, namely (1) "Loop Antenna" and (2) "Open Antenna." "Loop Antenna" is commonly used on land and is quite suitable for short-wave transmission and reception. As for "Open Antenna," it is more widely used. The diagram is as follows:</p>
<p>This type of antenna is made of bare wire 300 feet long. One end is tied to the antenna shaft on the fuselage, and the other end is tied to a small lead block to make it float in the air. This antenna is led out of the airplane through a guide tube (as shown in Figure 1). The interior of the guide tube is a metal surface that is in direct contact with the antenna and leads to the radio box to connect the circuit. The length of the antenna can be adjusted with a rotating shaft (the antenna needs to be shortened when the airplane lands to avoid breaking).</p>
<p>Because the weight of the falling lead block often causes the airplane to lose its balance, the remedy is to add appropriate balancing objects to the engine part. The broadcasting effect of the radio waves can be seen in (Figure 2). Because the antenna is installed unbalanced, the electric axis is often moved, so the highest radio wave transmission and reception is often slightly to the right of the fuselage. This is what the driver should pay attention to.</p>
<p>The cross-sectional view of the guide tube can be viewed in detail in (Figure 3). The outer tube is made of Bakelite or other insulating material and is tightly installed on the side of the fuselage. The inner tube is made of metal, and the antenna passes through this tube. There is a wiring terminal next to the inner tube to connect to the electric box.</p>
<p>The length of the antenna varies with the wavelength. In general, the length of the antenna (in feet) is equal to the wavelength specified in the table. However, because the wavelength is closely related to the balance and direction of the airplane, the length of the antenna should be adjusted at any time with a rotating shaft to cope with all special situations.</p>
<p>Recently, the trend of using dual antennas has become more and more widespread. This type of installation is no different from the previous one. Only a similar antenna is installed on the right side of the fuselage. The length of each line is about 150 feet. The main benefit of using dual antennas is that the fuselage is easy to balance, the driving is not difficult, and the sound reception is also easier.</p>

<h3 id="e171">The Frequency Characteristics of Audio Frequency Amplifiers <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Audio frequency amplifiers are an indispensable main component of any radio receiver. Because their input frequency is within the audio range, there is no need for tuning. Therefore, it seems unnecessary to consider their frequency characteristics during design. However, general audio frequency amplifiers cannot equally amplify all high and low audio frequencies. This is especially true for signals above 10,000 Hz, and this point is closely related to the issue of distortion, which cannot be ignored. To avoid this drawback, the following three points should be noted when designing audio frequency amplifiers:</p>
<p>First, it is necessary to maintain equal amplification power for each frequency. The amplification power obtained at each stage should be slightly sacrificed. Although overloaded vacuum tubes can provide strong output, they cannot achieve balanced amplification. To achieve this, the load resistance of the vacuum tube should be chosen to be smaller.</p>
<p>Second, audio frequency amplification vacuum tubes should be selected to have a smaller input resistance. Almost all triodes are suitable for this condition, such as 201A, 37, 56, etc. No. 30 is particularly suitable. This point can increase the amplification power of low frequencies.</p>
<p>Third, regarding the choice of coupling method. Transformer and impedance coupling can easily hinder the uniformity of amplification power due to the influence of inductance. Direct coupling often suffers from instability after prolonged use, which is also not very satisfactory. It is best to adopt the common resistance coupling method.</p>
<p>In addition to the above three points, there are several more methods to adjust or increase the amplification power of various frequencies:</p>
<p>A parallel LC circuit can be added to the plate circuit of the amplification tube (as shown in Figure A). If the amplification power of a certain frequency is low, the LC circuit can be adjusted to resonate with this frequency. At this time, the impedance of the LC circuit is the highest for the resonant frequency, and the voltage drop across L is also the largest. This voltage drop will be added to the voltage drop across the plate resistance, so as to obtain an increase in volume.</p>
<p>Another method to increase the volume of the amplifier is to utilize regeneration (see Figure B). Capacitor C is the one that generates regeneration. Only a very small capacitance is needed, and a portion of the output power can be fed back to the input circuit through this. However, it is necessary to pay attention that the feedback power should not be too strong, causing the vacuum tube to oscillate. The situation is completely the same as using regeneration in the detection stage, which readers can understand.</p>
<p>The grid-plate capacitance of vacuum tubes is extremely unfavorable for high-frequency signals. If it can be leveled off according to the method in Figure C, the volume of high frequencies can be increased.</p>
<p>To increase the volume of low frequencies, the impedance of the signal returning to ground must be reduced to a very low level. This can be achieved by adding a bypass capacitor C (Figure D).</p>
<p>If an audio frequency amplifier can be tested one by one according to the above points, then regardless of the frequency, the maximum equal amplification power can be obtained, and the working efficiency can naturally be better than usual.</p>
<h3 id="e172">The Method of "Soldering" <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>To have a good performing radio, the first thing to do is to ensure that the connections in the machine are well connected, so that the current can flow smoothly without obstruction, and then the whole machine can work normally. "Soldering" is the only way to make the wiring connections good. The method is also very simple, but it also requires considerable tools and techniques, otherwise it is difficult to obtain satisfactory results. Now briefly describe the soldering method as follows for reference.</p>
<p>Before soldering, first gather the tools in one place. Including soldering iron, flux, solder, and heating equipment. Soldering irons are also sold in radio parts stores. The copper tip should be selected to be larger (weighing 40 or 50 grams is most suitable), because smaller ones are easily cooled after heating, and there is the trouble of frequent heating; if there is an electric soldering iron, it is more convenient to use. Flux is used to remove oxides on the surface of the metal to be soldered, such as rosin, borax, hydrochloric acid, sodium borate, zinc chloride, etc. Rosin should be used here because it is cheap, easy to obtain, and non-corrosive. Solder is a kind of easily fusible tin alloy, which is sold in Chinese copper and tin shops, commonly known as "hook light". The heating equipment is most convenient with a large alcohol lamp, and a charcoal stove can also be used; but a coal stove is not suitable, because the sulfur in the coal is easy to combine with the copper tip of the soldering iron to form copper sulfide, which hinders soldering; if an electric soldering iron is used, the current heats it.</p>
<p>When everything is ready, make the soldering iron "tinned" (a soldering iron that has not been tinned cannot adhere solder to it). First polish the tip of the soldering iron, then fully heat it to a dull red, and melt a little rosin on it, then apply solder to its tip, so that there is a thin layer of shiny tin.</p>
<p>When soldering, first polish the soldering area to make it shine with metallic luster, then find a way to twist it together, and place a small piece of rosin on it. Then, use the tinned soldering iron to melt an appropriate amount of solder, and make this solder fully distributed on the area to be soldered, and wait for it to cool and solidify to form.</p>
<p>There are several points to pay attention to when working. A. Do not excessively heat the soldering iron, otherwise the tin on its tip will disappear due to overheating, so that it cannot adhere to the solder in the future. (If it can no longer adhere to the solder, it should be "tinned" to remedy it.) Therefore, heat to the degree that it can melt the solder (when green flames occur next to the copper tip of the soldering iron, it means that the heating is sufficient). B. During soldering, the temperature of the area to be soldered must be at the melting point of the solder, otherwise it cannot be soldered firmly. C. This method is suitable for soldering copper, brass, iron, tin, lead, zinc and other metals, but not suitable for soldering aluminum.</p>
<p>The soldering method is very simple, and if you can practice a little, you will be able to handle it with ease.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Shanghai Time for Receiving Short Waves <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Xiyuan</p>
<p>Since shortwave radios have become popular, there are quite a few amateurs who build their own shortwave sets. However, listening to shortwave broadcasts is not as convenient as listening to regular broadcasts. One has to search for broadcast times in foreign shortwave magazines and go through the cumbersome procedures of checking longitudes and latitudes and calculating time differences from maps. The time table below, which has recently been updated, was seen in a Western newspaper. I thought this would be somewhat useful for comrades who love shortwave broadcasts. So I immediately copied and translated it. Although there are only fifteen shortwave broadcasting stations in it, they are all very famous major stations in Europe and Australia. If you have a small shortwave receiver that uses two 30 tubes, as long as the coil matching is accurate and you have a good antenna and ground wire, you can listen to them one by one on time.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Radio Broadcasting in Japan (Continued) <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Guanghua</p>
<p>Time and Programs</p>
<p>The broadcasting time is from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM. The content of the programs includes government bulletins, weather forecasts, education, entertainment, children's time, etc. The time and programs are all formulated by the association by hiring various experts and organizing a broadcasting review committee. In the past two years, the association has solicited opinions from listeners several times on what kind of programs they need. Newspapers also devote a lot of space every day to publish and discuss the programs of the day. Therefore, Japanese people themselves feel that the broadcasting programs in recent years have made significant progress, not only in terms of quantity, but also in terms of quality.</p>
<p>The morning exercises under the leadership of the broadcasting station are worth mentioning. This kind of program has invisibly become a national health movement. When the second summer radio gymnastics was held in August 1933, more than 3,580,000 people participated for about twenty days.</p>
<p>In order to enable listeners in various places to fully understand the language of the reporters (there are also dialects in Japanese, such as the dialects of Tokyo and Kyushu, which are completely different), the association has a movement to standardize the national language, which will definitely make a great contribution to the national language and culture in the future.</p>
<p>As for entertainment, from the aristocratic "Noh drama" to the common people's "Naniwa-bushi" (ancient Japanese drama) in the afternoon, as well as ancient and modern music and old and new folk songs, are constantly being broadcast. The larger radio stations have orchestras, and the regular noon music programs are mostly broadcast by orchestras. At around 8:00 or 9:00 in the evening, it is probably a relay of the song and dance drama from the Takarazuka Girls' Revue Theater, which is the most popular entertainment program.</p>
<p>In terms of education, there are more than a dozen types, including "Adult Education Lectures," "Women's Education Lectures," and "Foreign Language Lectures." What is particularly noteworthy is the "Emergency Lectures." In the past, there were lectures on the Northeast Incident, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, etc. Now, lectures on World War II and investing in "Manchukuo" are being conducted. Whether it is "Manchuria is Japan's land lifeline" or "The South Pacific Islands are Japan's ocean lifeline," they are constantly giving Japanese citizens a shot in the arm.</p>
<p>Other programs, such as the university league baseball game held every spring and autumn at the Meiji Jingu Stadium in Tokyo, and the national high school league baseball game sponsored by the Asahi Shimbun every summer, are broadcast live by Tokyo JOAK, which is the most popular sports program. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Rumors Abound, Gold Price Rises Again to 8.3 Yuan</p>
<p>Banks Continue to Sell Drafts, Market Weakens Midday</p>
<p>Rumors Fuel Buying, Ending in Large Transactions</p>
<p>The gold market is in a situation of rumors and continuous upward trends. However, due to settlement issues, buyers are hesitant to be too active. In addition, banks continue to supply grain coupons, and there is a lot of profit-taking in the middle. But the upward trend is still difficult to contain. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and the US both rose. The forward silver price rose by one cent. The London pure gold price fell by three and a half pence. The exchange rate rose slightly. Off-market preliminary transactions opened, retreating to 95.6 yuan, and then rose to 7 yuan. The Central Bank announced its exchange rates, with the UK and the US unchanged, and customs gold falling by 5 cents. The standard price for bidding was posted, retreating to 100.21 yuan, and then continued to fall. The morning opened low. After the opening, buyers still had an appetite. The market situation was in excess demand. Gradually rose. The foreign exchange market was still loose. Supply was still pouring in, taking advantage of the high price. The price hovered downward. The HSBC Bank's exchange rates for the UK and the US were announced unchanged. The selling momentum suddenly became strong and weak. But after the low, it maintained its strength and rose again. Major clients replenished their positions again and again. The market sentiment was uncertain. Afterwards, it once broke through the 1,000 yuan mark. The Central Bank supplied some recent drafts. The silver balance tax was announced, still levied at 6.75%. The pound was calculated at one shilling and five pence and five nine three seven five. Buyers were slightly disappointed. However, because the sellers did not take the opportunity to work hard, the decline was still flat. The pullback was very slow. Finally, supply and demand were balanced. The ending was hesitant. The potential for the future market is still firm. The market gradually rose immediately. However, because banks still sold at high prices, there was a lot of struggle at the 1,000 yuan mark. After entering, the buying momentum rose again. People were panicked. Rumors about the prohibition of silver circulation and changes in the current economic system were spreading again. The upward trend became even stronger. General short sellers also replenished their positions. There was a lack of supply in the market. The gold price rose again and again. The market closed very well. Although there was a pullback after the close, it was still able to pull up under the replenishment of short positions by major clients. The psychology of the industry was always fearful. Once encountered with turbulence, it was difficult to control. Judging from its future, there is a possibility of a sharp rise.

<p>Bond Market Calms Before Settlement</p>
<p>Only Retail Swap Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday was one or two days before the final month at the Chinese Securities Exchange. There was no increase or decrease in overnight foreign exchange rates, and the market price was as stable as usual, without any significant signs of a short squeeze. This has been a consistent phenomenon in recent months. Most transactions, apart from those prepared in advance and off-exchange swaps, were limited. Due to the small number of retail investors, the market has become calm. Today is the last day of the month, and even if there is any squeezing, it will only be a local change. The future of overnight foreign exchange rates is not likely to ease in the short term. The tight credit situation is an undeniable fact. Therefore, although the environment is still good, it cannot rise. It is predicted that the market price will not rise sharply before settlement. Yesterday, the market was quite calm. Major players had few transactions, and swaps were mostly retail. The opening was slightly weak, but it rose slightly from 19. The follow-up prices were better by one jiao to two or three jiao. The second session continued to improve by one or two jiao, but 19 was slightly better by one or two jiao, with no trend to speak of. However, due to slight differences in supply and demand, minor ripples occurred. In the afternoon, transactions were less, and there was a chaotic situation with highs and lows. The fluctuations were only one or two jiao. As settlement approached, the aspect was peaceful, reducing unnecessary squeezing. As a result, the market price was slightly better by five fen, one jiao to three jiao. The total turnover was about 1.56 million yuan. The results of the ups and downs are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Sees Slight Rise</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market rose slightly on the 22nd. Railway stocks were no longer under pressure, utility stocks rose slightly, and copper and iron stocks needed to improve. The latter is due to the expectation that the steel industry will improve significantly. The National Distillers Products Corporation's business is quite developed, so the stock is strong, and alcohol stocks are also firm. The rise in utility stocks is because the New York Public Service Commission declared that if the municipal government insists on increasing the utility companies' taxes, the commission will raise the price of electricity. The bond market is stable, and the demand for U.S. government bonds is good. In the small exchange, kerosene, utilities, and alcohol stocks are in demand, so the market is rising. Chicago wheat is falling. Although corn is firm, it is reported that 18 million English bushels of French wheat will be shipped to the United States for livestock feed. The total turnover for the day was 770,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>

<p>Buyers Prepare to Take Delivery, Marked Yarn Gradually Returns to Higher Trend</p>
<p>The yarn market is becoming firmer and the situation is very tight. Due to buyers preparing to take delivery, people's hearts are quite strong, and the financial community's intention is to see higher prices, so the market is gradually moving towards a peak. However, current yarn sales are relatively weak, so major players' short positions are still not enough to cover, it is said.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Rises Three, Four, Six Jiao Marked yarn market opened in the morning. Due to the slight rise in American cotton and the sharp rise in Indian cotton, the market atmosphere was good. Trading was slightly weak in the second and third sessions, but cotton prices were very high. As a result, each month rose by 1, 2, and 4 jiao. The afternoon opening was relatively flat because current yarn transactions were more sluggish. However, the market price turned tighter and rose at the close, and each month rose by another 2, 3, and 4 jiao. The total turnover for the day was 25,100 bales.

<p>Marked Cotton Long Positions Closing Near Months, Moving to Distant Months</p>
<p>The cotton market was flat in the morning and rose in the afternoon because a certain company's large positions were closed and not released, and near-month contracts were sold and rolled into distant-month contracts. American cotton was flat, but Indian cotton rose sharply. As a result, the buyers' pull became stronger, and most of the cotton is now in the hands of the banks, so the current cotton situation is also expensive. At the close, it was heard that the gold price had broken through 1,000 yuan again, and the marked cotton distant-month prices rose even more.</p>
<p>Distant-Month Cotton Rises Vigorously The marked cotton market opened well in the morning, but Japanese merchants withdrew 3,000 to 4,000 dan of near-month contracts, causing the market to loosen slightly. At the same time, Tongcheng Company released near-month contracts and purchased distant-month contracts. As a result, near-month contracts fell by 5 fen to 2.5 jiao, and distant-month contracts rose by 5 fen. The afternoon situation suddenly tightened due to some hedging, and Indian cotton continued to rise. Each month rose by 2 or 3 jiao. The total turnover for the day was 129,900 dan. It was found that Ruiyuan sold 1,900 dan, Yuanyi 1,000 dan, Ruichang 4,200 dan, Daji 1,300 dan, Jifeng 4,900 dan, Dafu 2,900 dan, Suilong 1,200 dan, Gengfeng 3,400 dan, Junchang 1,200 dan, Yicheng 2,600 dan, Changfeng 4,700 dan, and Yongchang 1,800 dan.

<p>High Current Cotton Prices Make Sales Difficult The current cotton sales are still flat, but with the rise in cotton futures, spot merchants are asking for very high prices, resulting in weak transactions. Incoming remittances include 480 bales of Yao cotton and 880 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>US Cotton Fields Reduced by 25%</p>
<p>On the 22nd, the New York cotton market saw the competition of foreign cotton gradually receding, and the rumor of selling 700,000 bales of cotton to Germany based on the principle of barter trade resurfaced.

<p>Soybean Oil Import Tax Increase Causes Oil Prices to Soar</p>
<p>A Rise of 7-8 Jiao, Tax of 30%</p>
<p>Yesterday, the miscellaneous grain market suddenly heard that the import tax on soybean oil was increased from the original rate of 15% to 30%. The atmosphere was boiling and indescribable. How to deal with this additional tax on future goods that have always been sold? If the selling firms are responsible, it is said that about 14,000 to 15,000 baskets of soybean oil have been sold, and the tax is levied on each basket of 4.5 dan on the market scale, which is a heavy burden. At this time of extremely tight credit, there is this sudden tax increase. Although the Japanese want to dump Northeast soybean oil and exempt its export tax, each dan is only reduced by about 3 jiao, and the increase is one yuan and several jiao. Therefore, the miscellaneous grain industry sent representatives to the customs to state their opinions, asking them to consider and remedy it from the perspective of people's livelihood and commerce. (According to the regulations, raw materials are still taxed at 15% and have not been increased.) Therefore, people were excited. The market was still flat in the morning, but in the afternoon, the soybean oil market suddenly showed a very abnormal change. This month rose by 7 jiao, December rose by 8 jiao, January rose by 7 jiao, February rose by 8.5 jiao, March rose by 7.5 jiao, and April rose by 9.5 jiao. The standard car of yellow head rose by 1.5 jiao in February, 1.6 fen in March, and the standard soybean rose by 2.6 fen in April. Sesame was also the same, continuing to rise by 4 or 5 fen. The reason is that the oil price is optimistic and the destination is tight. Yesterday's transaction was 600-700 bags of sesame. Soybean cake is bound to rise. Manufacturers intend to sell, which must rise 6-7 fen compared with the previous day.</p>
<p>Flour and Wheat Have No Good Prospects</p>
<p>But Because of the Increased Tax Rate on Soybean Oil, It Is Feared That Wheat Will Also Be Affected</p>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month presented a near-flat and distant-punishment phenomenon. The quoted price of foreign wheat was about 1-2 jiao lower for Chicago, and about 8 fen lower for Canada. When the price was opened, this month was dull due to sluggish actual sales, and both the North and South gangs had little activity, so the transactions in each session were flat. The distant months were also weak at first, but then turned stable because the factories did not dump and the outside industry had a good mood. When the afternoon session opened, this month was gradually disposed of due to floating longs, and the market was full of returned goods due to the lack of improvement in actual sales, so the market atmosphere was flat throughout. The distant months were also flat at first, but then the asking price improved slightly in each session because the buying interest was still strong and miscellaneous grains rose due to tariffs, and people were also concerned. As a result, this month was slightly smaller by half a fen, December was better by one fen, January was better by one fen and seven li and a half, February and March were better by fen and two li and a half, and April was better by one fen and seven li and a half.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the market for each month was generally flat. The quoted price of foreign wheat was about 1-2 jiao lower for Chicago, and about 8 fen lower for Canada. When the price was opened, the transactions for each month were still flat. The near term was slightly smaller by one or two fen, while the distant term was stable. By the time the afternoon session opened, the price fluctuations were minimal this month due to the proximity of delivery. In the distant months, the domestic miscellaneous grains drove the price increase due to tariffs, and some buying interest was also active, and because the tariff increases and decreases varied, or perhaps they would affect wheat, people's mood was high. As a result, this month was unchanged, December rose by five fen, January rose by four fen, and February rose by six fen, March rose by five fen, The current wheat market is still flat and not much different from the previous day. Shandong wheat opened at 3 yuan, 8 jiao, 1 or 2 fen, Suzhou wheat 3 yuan, 8 jiao, 1 fen, Guide wheat 3 yuan, 8 jiao, 2 fen, Weiwan wheat 3 yuan, 8 jiao, Xuzhou wheat 3 yuan, 8 jiao, Jiangbei wheat 3 yuan, 7 jiao and half. Fuxin Wheat bought 1,000 bags out of 5,000 bags.</p>

As a result, the wind of falling prices started suddenly. As a result, each grade of early rice was scarce, and the price fell sharply by two or three jiao. Customer gangs wrapped their stomachs. In addition to the Yantai gang continuing to handle 100-200 bags, the Tongzhou gang suddenly started and adopted 700-800 bags, with a drop of only 1-2 jiao. The various colors of Du Yang, semi-Yin Yuan, etc., all saw fatigue and decline.</p>

<p>Xu Kui Seeds Have Reached a Low Disk</p>
<p>Black melon seeds have recently seen a weak and sluggish trend due to sluggish sales. However, the market price has reached a low point. For example, in terms of Xu Kui seeds in previous years, 12-13 liang was also common. The market price has now fallen to 8 yuan, 4-5 jiao, which is extremely cheap. Therefore, warehouse users are very concerned. If someone buys in and hoards in the future market, then there will be hope for the future.</p>
<p>Longkou Vermicelli Land Price Drops by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Since the new goods of Longkou vermicelli have arrived in Shanghai, the sales have been sluggish, and the opening price of passenger goods has repeatedly declined. It has dropped from 21 yuan and a half to 20 yuan. Yesterday, the market had a further opening trend. The firm also did not succeed in offering 19 yuan and a half. Recently, only a few sporadic transactions have been made in this street by the sellers. The selling price in the south is 19 yuan and a half, and the selling price in the north is 21 yuan, with no buyers. According to a telegram from the production area, the price per package has fallen by another 5 jiao to 26 yuan. However, it is still difficult to calculate in Shanghai, so the firms lack follow-up. There may be a possibility of continued small sales in the future.</p>

<p>Overseas Silk Market Gradually Prospering</p>
<p>According to a telegram from local private sources, the New York silk market has shown signs of recovery and is gradually moving towards its former prosperity. Most people engaged in this business are optimistic because consumption last month was more than 49,000 bales. This month is expected to be similar, which is an increase of nearly 40% compared to the lowest month. If this number can be maintained every month, then silk-producing countries can also slightly break this dull situation. Domestic consumption in Japan has also increased this year. The Yokohama market has recently been at 530-540 yen, which is a difference of 100 yuan from the lowest time. It may rise to 600 yen in the future. It is said that the so-called stagnant raw silk in Japan a few years ago may be moved. However, due to the competitive relationship of rayon, there will be no mad rush. It is expected that our country's qualified goods sold to the United States will have great export hope. However, we still need to see the trend of exchange rates. I hope the silk industry will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Shanghai Raw Silk Exports Show Slight Improvement</p>
<p>From the 1st to the 15th of this month, Shanghai factory silk and Sichuan yellow factory silk have quite a lot of transactions. However, 7 silkworms are still lacking in demand in Europe and the United States. Various local silks and silkworms are still exported to India and Africa in small quantities. The export statistics for the past two weeks are listed below (unit: package)</p>
<p>First half of November Since August this year</p>
<p>White factory silk 538 4,884</p>
<p>Yellow factory silk 326 514</p>
<p>Li and white native silk 133 1,2126</p>
<p>Seven yellow and yellow native silk 203 2,21</p>

<p>Saw New Tung Oil</p>
<p>The Old Tung Oil in the Han Market Is Still Full, and the Market Has No Characteristics. Western Hubei and Zhejiang Have a Good Harvest, and Western Zhejiang Has a Major Failure.</p>
<p>Tung oil has been seen everywhere. The old oil in the Han market, such as Jingzhi and Jinma, is still full, so there is no urgent need to sell new goods. The news from the producing areas in western Hubei all say that the harvest is still good. However, new goods need to arrive in Han around the winter solstice, so the current market is still the old oil market. The general price of heavy Jing is around 14 yuan, plain Jing is 13 yuan, 3 or 4 jiao, and Macheng is 13 yuan, 7 or 8 jiao. Sales are normal, and the market is also stable and uneventful. The harvest in Jinhua and Lanxi in eastern Zhejiang is very good. Recently, hundreds of new goods arrive every day. The price received by the firm is 13 yuan, 2 or 4 jiao per load. Because the arrival of goods is not prosperous, the price is difficult to fall low. In the future, the total must be 13 yuan to enter the customs, then those who handle it everywhere can calculate. There is also Jiaxing area in western Zhejiang, where the harvest is very bad. Statistics show that only 30-40% can be harvested, so the price of seeds was initially 4 yuan and 5 jiao per market peck as the normal price. Recently, the price has increased by 2 or 3 jiao because the shipment is not prosperous. However, the juice is 2 or 3 catties shorter than last year. Theoretically, the price of seeds must fall to be in line with the investment. Unexpectedly, the price of seeds has risen due to the scarcity of goods, which makes the oil workshops very troublesome. Therefore, they have been slow to start pressing so far. It can be asserted that the new oil will be delayed in the future. Moreover, according to this situation, the cost is difficult to be cheap and is higher than northern oil. Shanghai may not be able to calculate it.</p>

<h3 id="e186">The Safest Small Business Industry Is Nothing More Than This <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Handmade Can Defeat Machines Amateurs Can Make Envelopes and Print Business Cards</p>
<p>Envelopes are something that only insiders can make. In the handicraft industry, it is considered a specialized industry and is called an envelope workshop. Since the advent of machine-made envelopes, the handicraft industry has been defeated and has no room to stand. It is really pitiful and annoying. Now I have come up with a way for the original envelope workshop to specialize in mounting instead of making, so that the output can be increased by more than double. Our factory cuts the envelope blanks and marks the lines and creases. All you need to do is paste the mouth, and it will be successful. Therefore, even complete amateurs can do it. Taking the tooth powder bag as an example, each person can make 2,000 per day and earn a wage of 4 jiao. Any place can make and sell locally. Today's envelopes mostly need to be printed with advertisements, so for this business, just contact the local printers and supply them with the finished white envelope blanks to print. As long as they are cheap, even cheaper than machine-made envelopes, they are of course welcome to use them, because the labor cost of machine-made envelopes is 4 yuan per 10,000 (excluding mounting labor), so in places where labor is cheap, you can still use handmade to defeat machines. Moreover, because we make our own paper, our purpose is only to promote the sales of paper, so we specially leave this work to be earned by the inland labor force, so that your selling price can still be 1 or 2 yuan cheaper per 10,000 than those machine-made envelopes. The number of sales of printing shops is often 100,000-200,000, and they are definitely taking the cheap route, so you can rest assured about sales. But with a capital of 100-200 yuan, it can become a constant industry. Other things are still afraid of being shelved and never sold. Envelopes are not time-sensitive, so I said that the safest small business industry is nothing more than this. If you want to print red labels yourself, it is also very easy. We have already made a set of simple letterpress printing equipment, arranged the red label version, and equipped it with ink rollers. You can print it yourself, and you can also print business cards. This set of equipment only costs 5 yuan, isn't it extremely cheap?</p>
<p>(Attached white) There is a detailed list of white envelope blanks and stationery paper for your use. Please attach a 5-fen stamp for a sample of the envelope.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Children, Lions, Camels <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Yu</p>
<p>I also want to preach like Nietzsche, but my opinion is completely opposite to Nietzsche's. Nietzsche said: "The three metamorphoses of the spirit I designate to you: how the spirit becomes a camel, the camel a lion, and finally the lion a child" (see the English translation of Thus Spoke Zarathustra in the Modern Library); but I believe that if the three metamorphoses of the spirit are natural developments, it is a child transforming into a lion, and a lion transforming into a camel. Due to the different starting points, the difference in opinions is naturally very large, because Nietzsche advocates the superman, but his so-called superman cannot be found in our society. Therefore, the camel that he speaks of bearing heavy burdens must be transformed into a lion, the master of the wilderness, once it reaches the wilderness. And because lions cannot create new values in the wilderness, lions must also become innocent, forgetful, and extremely affirmative children - his superman worldview fundamentally exists outside of reality and is not what I understand. And we advocate ordinary people, which is a fact, not an ideal. In fact, there is no need for any subjective advocacy. In any society, these ordinary people are encountered everywhere, and everyone is one of the ordinary people. With all five senses and all parts of the body, there is nothing missing and nothing extra, which is the standard ordinary person. Occasionally there are one or two people who have some special features that others do not have, but even if there are some special features, they are not characteristics of the superman. If there are, in the society of ordinary people, this is probably not something to be proud of, but rather something to be ridiculed.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the society of ordinary people, supermen cannot be found, and the existence of supermen is not allowed at all. A child is born, and you will see his parents teach him how to become an ordinary person, his teachers teach him how to become an ordinary person; his society teaches him how to become an ordinary person: he is innocent, but his parents, teachers, and society want to teach him to be sensible, and what is called being sensible is naturally to understand the things of ordinary people: he is forgetful, but his parents, teachers, and society want to teach him not to forget, and what is called not forgetting is naturally not to forget the things of ordinary people: he is extremely affirmative, but his parents, teachers, and society want to teach him what you should do (Thou Shall) and what you are not allowed to do (Thou Shall nat). What is called what you should do and what you should not do is naturally to teach him to do things that ordinary people are allowed to do and not to do things that ordinary people are not allowed to do (this was started in the Ten Commandments of Moses "The Commandments" three thousand four hundred years ago). By the time the child becomes an adult, his body, though as strong as a lion, and his character, though still with the wildness of a lion, he is a domesticated member of society, and by no means the master of the wilderness. He is a lion confined in a cage by society! When he gets older, what his eyes see are the things of ordinary people; what his ears hear are the things of ordinary people; what his nose smells is the smell of ordinary people; what he thinks in his heart are the concepts of ordinary people; plus the traditions of the past thousands of years, the social customs that cannot be liquidated at present, he is a complete camel bearing heavy burdens.</p>
<p>I believe that in the society of ordinary people, the transformation of the spirit is a child transforming into a lion, and a lion transforming into a camel.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Another Discussion of "One Method Leads to All" <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Wu Xie's "One Method Leads to All" was recently sent to me by Mr. Lu Dubu of Yuezhou. This book by the elder Mr. Wu is truly very interesting. At the beginning of the book is his preface, written in "the seventh month of the Yi Si year of Guangxu," and the title page states "engraved in the Bing Wu year of Guangxu," which, calculating it, is just about thirty years ago.</p>
<p>Why did he write this book?</p>
<p>Originally, he wanted to use it to replace elementary textbooks. At that time, the elementary textbooks used in new schools roughly started with recognizing characters and then explaining them. The characters were concrete words, also called static words. After accumulating dozens of characters, they would then learn to fill in words and piece together sentences. This was certainly an improvement over the old method of memorizing the Four Books and Five Classics in private schools. However, the elder Mr. Wu still felt that this method was not enough, believing that single characters were difficult to remember, and it would be better to recognize and explain characters while simultaneously teaching and piecing together sentences. Moreover, concrete and abstract words should be taught together, so why distinguish them? Therefore, he wanted to write "One Method Leads to All." In my opinion, it is indeed ten times better than elementary textbooks of the time, such as "Character Lessons with Illustrations." Unfortunately, I didn't get this book when I was first learning, otherwise, I might have suffered less in my language learning.</p>
<p>Can this book actually be used to teach beginners?</p>
<p>According to the elder Mr. Wu's own experience, he said:</p>
<p>"If children in my family study the classics for three years and still don't understand, they will all understand after studying this for one year. Those who cannot write family letters will all be able to."</p>
<p>This is certainly reliable. Think about it, how can you explain the great way of the sages in the classics to children? It's useless even if you explain it for three years. "One Method Leads to All" is a rhyming book compiled with proverbs, which is easy to read aloud, easy to explain clearly, and easy to remember. Of course, after reading and explaining it, they will understand in one year and be able to write family letters. The elder Mr. Wu did not belittle the classics, nor did he rebel against the way of the sages. However, for the sake of children's learning and happiness, he did not advocate reading and explaining the classics. He had a considerable understanding of the elementary textbooks of the new schools at that time, and he even took the initiative to compile a proverb reader. An old gentleman thirty years ago had this insight, which truly makes us unenterprising younger generations ashamed to death!</p>
<p>This book is compiled according to the order of rhyme categories, a total of three volumes, bound in three books. Now, I will excerpt a little bit from the last article of the last volume, the "Moon" rhyme, to give a glimpse of the book's content.</p>
<p>The boat can pass, the rudder can pass. I can report the tune, but I cannot sing it.</p>
<p>If it doesn't blow, it's still cold. If you don't owe debts, you can still be poor.</p>
<p>The main house is extinct, the side house prospers. The upper house is uncle, the lower house is cousin.</p>
<p>Measles must be vented, smallpox must scab. Wrap everything, sweep everything.</p>
<p>The clan has merit, the ancestors have virtue. The north goes to the Xiongnu, the south goes to the Yue.</p>
<p>Not afraid of nonsense, but afraid of no speech.</p>
<p>Grain is collected in August, money is collected in December.</p>
<p>Better to be hit by a mountain man, than by a water man.</p>
<p>Hitting gold, you recognize gold, hitting iron, you recognize iron.</p>
<p>A thousand murderers, eight hundred aggrieved.</p>
<p>To have such a virtuous host, and not have such a bad guest.</p>
<p>Tattered clothes harbor lice, dilapidated houses harbor thieves.</p>
<p>Killing people, you see blood, saving people, you save thoroughly.</p>
<p>Marry a wife for virtue, marry a concubine for beauty.</p>
<p>Though father and son are close, their financial minds are different.</p>
<p>If you know how to litigate, only litigate halfway.</p>
<p>Painting water, you paint sound, painting fire, you paint heat.</p>
<p>Each scholar has his own ambition, why force each other?</p>
<p>Taking risks, how can you choose in a hurry?</p>
<p>Borrow a thousand, don't need to pay back eight hundred right now.</p>
<p>What's real cannot be faked, what's fake cannot be real.</p>
<p>Hundred goods, hundred customers, cotton, cotton fluff customers.</p>
<p>Enter the door, observe the face, leave the door, observe the sky.</p>
<p>Words on the wall are hard to stick, words on the mat are hard to say.</p>
<p>Big business fears losses, small business fears shutting down.</p>
<p>Chess is the barren field board, cards are the field-selling book.</p>
<p>Saying words, eyes rolling white, this person cannot be associated with.</p>
<p>A little secret in the world, don't tell your wife and children.</p>
<p>The blacksmith doesn't drop iron, but pinches a piece right in front of you.</p>
<p>Selling soy milk and encountering cold weather, selling meat and encountering hot weather.</p>
<p>A medical family will surely prosper for three generations, a medical family will surely be wiped out for three generations.</p>
<p>When inviting guests, don't invite female guests, invite fifty, and a hundred will come.</p>
<p>Stewing loach in a stove, eat one piece, stew one piece.</p>
<p>Starting a family is like picking up with a needle, ruining a family is like snow melting in hot water.</p>
<p>From the top of the head, the Niwan Palace, to the soles of the feet, the Yongquan acupoint.</p>
<p>A monkey picks up a piece of ginger, can't eat it, can't throw it away.</p>
<p>The public repairs, the public gets, the old woman repairs, the old woman gets. Each repairs, each gets, if you don't repair, you won't get.</p>
<p>The above words are all popular slang in Hunan folk now, of course, many of them are common to various places. These living languages ​​can be used as rhetoric in vernacular writing. Don't say that the vocabulary of vernacular language is poor, and you have to go to classical books to find it. In my humble opinion, this book can be called "Proverb Reader." If someone compiles proverbs from various places, and uses Mr. Wu's method of dividing rhymes to compile a "Dictionary of Popular Rhymes" for general new writers to use to pick up rhetoric, so as to avoid going to ancient books and going astray, it would be truly a great merit!</p>

<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>The person whose ear was pulled, smiled mockingly while touching their reddened ear.</p>
<p>At first, I only felt a little surprised, but now, I was also made to laugh by this sentence, because judging from the hostess's wrinkled face and the fact that two or three teeth had fallen out, her true age seemed to be right for reversing fifteen years, and saying she was fifty.</p>
<p>"How could I be like fifteen years old!" She said, carrying the two umbrellas to the door and shaking off the water droplets on them, distractedly, while sighing as if suddenly realizing something, "At that time, who didn't mistake me for Miss Li's family? Alas, the clothes and accessories I wore..." Her gaze shot towards the Baiyi village and the late spring fields mixed with misty rain across the road, and she was silent for a while.</p>
<p>Probably my three companions were already familiar with her background, and they were not interested in asking about the story hidden in this sentence, but they joked even more interestingly.</p>
<p>"Hehe, why did you abandon being a young lady? Now, you've only ended up... Who is to blame..."</p>
<p>The private cigarette peddler actually sang mockingly in the Beijing opera tune he had heard from the city, but he swallowed the too lewd words in his throat and did not spit them out.</p>
<p>She immediately realized that she was being mocked, and immediately turned around, waved the umbrella near the private cigarette peddler, hit the empty space, and asked back with a stern face as if scolding:</p>
<p>"If that tigress hadn't branded people's backs with a soldering iron, who would be willing to run to Yifang Dam?"</p>
<p>Probably because I was a stranger, she glanced at me uneasily, and then pursed her wrinkled thin lips at the private cigarette peddler.</p>
<p>"If it were you, you would have died in that den long ago!"</p>
<p>When she said this, her tone seemed to be full of pride and glory. The private cigarette peddler didn't answer, just wiped the water droplets sprinkled on his face, and scolded:</p>
<p>"Damn it, drop your umbrella!"</p>
<p>At this time, the Baiyi monk seemed to have taken two or three pleasant puffs of smoke and enjoyed himself a little, so he sat up, re-draped the robe that had been scattered by sleep over his shoulder, and greeted the man who was cooking the opium happily.</p>
<p>"Zhe Nong, is it ready yet?"</p>
<p>She hurried over and carefully responded.</p>
<p>"Does the Buddha want another box?"</p>
<p>After the Baiyi monk left, she lay down, grabbed the opium pipe, and shouted softly and charmingly to the man cooking the opium:</p>
<p>"Come and lie down for a while, I'll burn you a good bubble!"</p>
<p>The sedan chair carrier put his arm around the person beside him and whispered with winking eyes:</p>
<p>"Look how affectionate they are!"</p>
<p>The private cigarette peddler, however, returned to his normal state, yawned, and said with a flat mouth:</p>
<p>"Bah, an old sow!"</p>
<p>At this moment, I suddenly understood why they had burst into laughter at my words just now, but a vein of mysterious mist hung in my heart as if enveloping the rain and smoke in the other side of the Baiyi.</p>
<p>The man did not go to bed to smoke opium, and he did not seem to agree, but showed his sturdy back in the thick rising steam.</p>
<p>The old hostess angrily threw the opium pipe into the wooden plate, sighed, and fell asleep silently.</p>
<p>We all stopped talking and turned our bored eyes to the outside of the door. The woods and thatched houses shrouded in misty rain sometimes appeared vaguely and sometimes disappeared, turning into a single color of heaven and earth, but the raindrops on the eaves kept ringing without stopping.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Reply to "Between Tears and Laughter" <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Di</p>
<p>I didn't expect that "The Malaysian of Eggplant Banana" in Free Talk could arouse Mr. Shao Yin's "Between Tears and Laughter," which makes me feel so honored!</p>
<p>However, it is a pity that Mr. Shao Yin's vision only likes to look at the big things, but doesn't like to look at the small ones, which makes Mr. Shao Yin fall into the cage of error and "Between Tears and Laughter"!</p>
<p>Mr. Shao Yin thought that what I said in Free Talk about the great assimilation power of the Chinese was only based on the small matter of gambling, and I didn't say "how big is it to give us proof," so he "dared not believe that the Chinese have the ability to assimilate Malaysians." From this, it can be fully seen that Mr. Shao Yin's vision only likes to look at the big things, but doesn't like to look at the small ones, because gambling is a small thing.</p>
<p>However, when we observe a certain thing, we must understand its authenticity from its most subtle aspects. If we only like to observe its large parts or its external form, we will often make mistakes in our understanding. There are naturally many examples of Chinese people assimilating Malays in Southeast Asia, and the reason why I only cited gambling as an example is that I believe that gambling is the easiest thing to flow into the lower class society and make people obsessed. Chinese people and Malaysians are two ethnic groups with different languages, scripts, customs, and habits. It is definitely not possible to assimilate these two completely different ethnic groups into one ethnic group in just ten, twenty years, or hundreds of years. It is not like two piles of clay that can be immediately kneaded into an idol at will. It must go through a long period of assimilation to be completed. Therefore, when two ethnic groups begin to assimilate, it must start from the smallest events in daily life. Although the smallest events are not limited to gambling, gambling is one of the smallest events in daily life. Can we deny that the Malaysians of eggplant banana have not been assimilated by the Chinese in their thinking about gambling? If the Malaysians of eggplant banana did not have the political protection of the British, who knows if they would not be completely assimilated by the Chinese in a hundred years or so?</p>
<p>Carefully examining Mr. Shao Yin's meaning, he thought that my citing gambling as an example was too small. Okay, let me give Mr. Shao Yin one or two larger examples. But to what extent they are large, I don't know, I have to ask Mr. Shao Yin to measure it himself.</p>
<p>First, in the South Seas Islands, there is a small island, Portuguese territory, called Timor (also known as Moore), where Chinese copper coins are used, Chinese language is spoken, and customs and habits are completely old forms brought from China. It is impossible for the Malaysians there not to want to assimilate with the Chinese.</p>
<p>Second, in a small mountain port in Belitung, Dutch East Indies (I can't remember the place name for a while), not only Chinese language is popular among the people, but also Chinese language is used in the court.</p>
<p>From these two points, Mr. Shao Yin will not have "dare not believe that the Chinese have the ability to assimilate Malaysians" again. In fact, the current Malaysians in the British and Dutch colonies can maintain their temporary survival only because of the political protection of the British and Dutch imperialism. Otherwise, I am afraid they would have been eliminated long ago.</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to say is that the main reason for the British's active anti-Chinese in recent years is naturally the serious aggravation of the economic panic. However, the gradual assimilation of Malaysians by the Chinese is also one of the reasons for promoting their anti-Chinese. The anti-Chinese in South Africa, Mexico, San Francisco, and the Dutch East Indies before the European War was not for economic panic at all, because capitalism was still in its golden age at that time. At that time, their anti-Chinese was because the Chinese everywhere took the place of the indigenous people with their spirit of perseverance and hard work, which made the imperialists feel chills.</p>

<p>— (Written by Zsigmond Moricz) Translated by Uncle Zhuang</p>
<p>"How do you five sleep in this room?"</p>
<p>"Very comfortably, my husband takes one of the three children to sleep on the bed, and I, with the other two children, sleep on a bundle of wheat straw on the ground."</p>
<p>"Even in winter?"</p>
<p>"Of course. Ah! This is a very good little house, as warm as a stove."</p>
<p>So, proudly, she showed me everything she had; a salt jar placed on a shelf, a flour box placed under the bed, a small kerosene lamp placed on the table. I have never seen a housewife more proud of her housework than she.</p>
<p>I continued to talk to her. She answered my questions with an intelligent frankness and a clear, cheerful voice.</p>
<p>"How did you meet your husband?" I asked her.</p>
<p>"Ah! This is a very strange thing, a true novel... At first, people praised him to me, people told me that a cripple was very suitable to be matched with me. Then, he doesn't drink, he's not vulgar, and he also has a good lifelong allowance... I, I lived in a neighboring village, my husband died in the war, and I thought, 'I should go see him, or this is God's will...' So, you know, he immediately loved me, because this is a very sincere man.</p>
<p>Did he use a flower car to greet you according to the customs here? Did your master use a four-horse carriage to pick you up here?"</p>
<p>"Ah! You think!" the woman said, "People were immediately jealous of my luck, and wanted to take him away from me. I should tell you that people said many rumors about me, saying that I was too fond of dressing up, and not worthy of being a poor man's wife."</p>

<h3 id="e194">Germany Again Becomes the Hammer of the World <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Germany was once a country that wanted to be the "hammer of the world." Before the war, it had the ambition to monopolize Europe and even the world. But since being defeated by Britain, France and other countries in 1917, this ambition has been wiped out.</p>
<p>Since then, Germany has completely become a "anvil of the world," severely hammered by major powers—especially France.</p>
<p>And now, a few ambitious people in Germany have the ambition to become the "hammer of the world" again. According to reports, German Labor Administrator Boerge said in a speech to the National Socialist Party youth in Cologne: "Germany will no longer be the anvil of the world in the future, but will be the hammer of the world." What an exaggerated tone.</p>
<p>In fact, Germany's desire to become the hammer of the world again did not start today. Since Hitler came to power, he has even more enthusiastically stirred up this ambition. However, the result of his efforts is to demand equality in armaments and to demand the return of the Saar region, etc., which have all been severely repulsed by Britain and France. Germany had no choice, so it could only withdraw from the League of Nations, simply close the door, and simply manufacture the hammer of the world.</p>
<p>If Germany wants to become the hammer of the world again, naturally, the first thing it must do is to hammer down its only target enemy, France. However, this is what Britain seems not to fully allow. Moreover, with France's current strength, it is difficult for Germany to have the power to hammer it down. Then, where will its iron hammer go? It's towards Russia, which has a vast territory. Therefore, the only person it can hammer at the moment is Russia. This is why today's Germany has become the only factor in Western Europe that can trigger a world war.</p>
<p>Similarly, Japan in the East is also fully and sweetly dreaming of becoming the "hammer of the world." This dream can be said to be half realized for it. Now the problem is Russia. How will Japan's "hammer of the world" strike into Russian territory? This is very hesitant. Furthermore, the United States on the east coast is also its mortal enemy. As long as these two enemies are not a problem, its "hammer of the world" dream seems to be 80 or 90 percent complete.</p>
<p>However, this dream will probably never be completed. Let's see how it is triumphant in its dreams and how it is frustrated in its dreams.</p>
<h3 id="e195">After Illness <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Chang Er</p>
<p>After being sick, I supported myself with a cane and took a walk alone in the park.</p>
<p>It was winter, quiet and silent. The path lay before me like an abandoned woman. The small trees on both sides rustled in the wind. Occasionally, a few yellow leaves rolled a few times over my head and fell into the muddy ground.</p>
<p>Looking up, I couldn't see the dense shade of the sky in winter, only a few thin tree trunks. The sun didn't feel warm on my body at all. This park also seemed to be sick and lifeless.</p>
<p>"A sympathetic child is here to see you!"</p>
<p>Whistling, I sat down on an empty iron sand chair, took out a book of poems from my coat, which a friend who didn't sign his name had sent to me from the post office when I was sick. On the cover were two lines of delicate handwriting:</p>
<p>Knowing that you are sick, I am sending you this book of poems as a pastime during your illness. Don't pursue the person who sent the book, we will have a chance to meet.</p>
<p>I flipped through it casually every day, and after reading each poem, it seemed that I had seen it somewhere, but there was no author's name or publishing house at the bottom of the page. It wasn't because of the suggestion in those two lines that I didn't try to think about who sent the book. I really didn't have that kind of thought during my illness. After reading it, I just piled it on the bookshelf. Later, after I moved, I didn't know where this book of poems was stuck. Today, while sorting out my clothes, I found it at the bottom of a broken box and stuffed it in my big night bag. Now that I saw those two lines again, I wanted to pursue the person who sent the book.</p>
<p>I stared at a group of sparrows foraging for food on the ground, and my thoughts followed their jumps, not knowing where they had gone. Suddenly, they flew away together, and a figure flashed at the end of the path.</p>
<p>"Another sympathetic child is here!"</p>
<p>Thinking, I watched a pair of high-heeled leather shoes slowly walk over from the withered yellow grass. My eyes lifted from her toes, and I quickly buried my head in my collar as if reading a book, listening quietly to the sound of the footsteps getting closer and closer. The toes had stopped in front of me. At the same time, someone patted me on the shoulder. I pretended to be suddenly startled and looked up.</p>
<p>"You've lost weight—I still recognize you."</p>
<p>"Yes, I've been sick for a long time."</p>
<p>I stood up and stuffed the book of poems into my coat pocket, wanting to walk away.</p>
<p>"I know," she supported my cane and walked side by side. "I wanted to visit you, but you moved."</p>
<p>I glanced at her, thought of the book of poems, and waved it in front of her.</p>
<p>"Did you send it?"</p>
<p>Nodding, "These are the poems you like to read."</p>
<p>"But the second time is not as interesting as the first time!"</p>
<p>"Then maybe you are not satisfied with the person who writes the poems?"</p>
<p>"I don't mean that, I am satisfied with every poet... Poets are passionate, aren't they?"</p>
<p>"Poor mouth!" Smiling, she kicked a small brick on the road, "Don't remember the past, poets are as free as the white clouds in the sky."</p>
<p>"Congratulations on being able to publish your second book of poems!"</p>
<p>"Seriously, can you tell me your address?"</p>
<p>"Are you planning to send me a book of poems? Thank you, my bookshelf is already full!"</p>
<p>"Okay, I live in a women's apartment, I hope</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>we will have a chance to meet again!"</p>
<p>I watched her disappear into the side of the road, stepping on the yellow leaves. I looked up, and the white clouds were flying in the sky.</p>
<p>"Free!" I stared again at the two lines of delicate handwriting on the cover.</p>
<h3 id="e196">The City God Temple and the Great World <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Shi</p>
<p>When foreigners come to China to sightsee, when they step on the land of Shanghai, the place names they can call out are the City God Temple and the Great World, as if these two places can represent the entire metropolis of Shanghai. Every tourist group that comes to Shanghai often finds a string of cars or rickshaws in these two places. As a result, many untrue news and photos are taken back to their countries for dishonest publicity. Foreign writers who create behind closed doors think that the whole of China is like this. This is still the case in Shanghai, the largest metropolis in the East. If they go deep into the culturally backward inland and feudal small villages, when they mention China, they can use braids and foot binding to represent it, which is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The conversation has gone so far, but in fact, the City God Temple and the Great World are just like Nanjing Road and the Great Light in the minds of people. Isn't it crowded with people every day?</p>
<p>When I was a child, I went to the City God Temple with my grandfather every day. In the eyes of a child, it was probably better than a tour group. The stalls selling sugar and various toys were all considered wonders of the world. Even watching the turtles crawling up with their heads raised on the Zigzag Bridge was particularly exciting. But when my grandfather arrived at the temple, he would go to the tea house. He never allowed me to run around, saying that I would be caught by kidnappers. So, I was satisfied with the small-scale overlooking of the patterns on the foreign railings. However, what gave me the impression of the City God Temple was not these, but the small stalls selling peanuts and dried tofu. Because the guests in this tea house were all my grandfather's friends, and when they met, they could talk a lot. When they talked, they naturally couldn't spare the energy to take care of me. Afraid that I would sneak down to play, they would reward the three armies and grab a table of snacks. So, the impression the City God Temple gave me was not fun, but delicious. Now it is said that the City God Temple still prevails in the "eat" aspect. From the front door, there are chestnut stalls, open-air dishes, noodle shops with meat and vegetables, and various snacks. It's simply a stall every five steps and a shop every ten steps. However, if you want me to find what foreigners think is unique, I am afraid it is those statues. However, compared with "God," there is not much difference.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Great World, I am really sorry. If it weren't for the diving friends showing their skills this summer, I wouldn't have had anything to do with it. So, what the Great World was like before, I can't imagine. However, the game venue is always a collection of miscellaneous things, and the tickets must be cheap. It is the only place for the so-called country people to come to Shanghai, as well as many shop assistants and workers, to have fun. People from other places can watch their local operas, which is of course particularly cordial. Beijing opera and spoken drama also have their supporters. I spent three hours making a patrol, and in addition to the fact that the crowds here were too disorderly, I also couldn't find anything that the foreign adults thought was particularly worthy of. I spent three yuan to watch the Kaleidoscope Troupe. I forgot that the clowns in one of the scenes were rolling all over the stage. What is the difference between this and the Great Brook Royal Estate here?</p>
<p>The City God Temple and the Great World have their own value and history. This point may be what the tour group pays special attention to.</p>

<p>— Gote</p>
<p>—A Thousand Sensations—</p>
<p>In the eyes of a pauper, this world is no different from a volcano, just like hell.</p>
<p>In the mouth of a tycoon, this world is the most blissful, as if it were heaven.</p>
<p>Only women understand true sorrow, only children know nothing of worldly worries, and only the elderly understand the true hardships of life. Only religious figures thoroughly understand the mystery of women, and only revolutionaries understand the fate of the world.</p>
<p>Life is meaningful when one is successful, and tasteless when one is frustrated.</p>
<p>Those who fear life are troubled by it, those who love life are trapped by it, those who do not understand life are harmed by it, and those who understand life are loved by it.</p>
<p>Those who wear tinted glasses see everything in color. Conversely, they are often dazzled by the colorful world.</p>
<p>I want to hold the world in my own palm. But the world kneads me under its armpit.</p>
<p>I want to make all the women in the world my slaves, but I am treated as their slave by all the women in the world.</p>
<p>I think that if people were not living for life, they would not fight each other.</p>
<p>If you are not selfish, I am not self-interested, and he is not self-loving, then everyone will be happy.</p>
<p>I think that the heads of foreigners are made of machines, the mouths of women are made of honey, the hearts of Chinese people are tofu-shaped, the feet of soldiers are cast in iron, and the hands of warlords are crab claws.</p>
<p>I hate those who love me. I love those who hate me.</p>
<p>Those without cultivation love noise, and those with learning prefer silence.</p>
<p>Those with narrow minds will never succeed in life.</p>
<p>Struggle is the driving force for the success of all undertakings.</p>
<p>Those with unwavering will will not fail; because they will not be discouraged by failure.</p>
<p>The most foolish people are the happiest people.</p>
<p>There is no one who does not lie, and no one who lies all their life.</p>
<p>Those who like to sneer are cunning. Those who are cunning are good at harming others.</p>
<p>Those who treat others with sincerity are often deceived by those who are not sincere.</p>
<p>Humans are the most intelligent of all things, but also the culprit of all things, because humans only care about humans.</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Master's Favor <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Da Ye</p>
<p>The little maid, Xiangxiang, stood in the corner by the door, watching Madam.</p>
<p>Madam, in front of the dressing table, applied powder, drew her eyebrows, shaded her eye circles, put on rouge, dabbed lipstick, all the way from head to toe.</p>
<p>Facing the mirror, Madam put on makeup for a long time, imitating the expressions she learned from the movies: smiling, acting coy.</p>
<p>Her large eyes in the mirror drifted to the young man standing next to her; the young man smiled, a smile that was somewhat impatient from waiting too long.</p>
<p>"Am I ready? Am I pretty enough!"</p>
<p>"Alright, don't rush."</p>
<p>Madam stood up giggling, turned to look at her back, then went to the coat rack to get her coat. The young man eagerly stepped forward to help her put it on.</p>
<p>Holding her arm, Madam sent a kiss to her husband, who was sitting alone at the table sipping beer, and then, in a coquettish voice, said, "Goodbye!" and swayed her hips out.</p>
<p>Xiangxiang paid attention to the husband's expression after Madam left, but he did not look angry, sipping his wine with a smug look.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the husband raised his voice and shouted, "Xiangxiang!"</p>
<p>As usual, after hearing this call, Xiangxiang brought up the prepared milk coffee.</p>
<p>As always, the husband smiled at her behind Madam's back, squinting his eyes and smiling: "Xiangxiang, you work so hard every day cooking, I feel very sorry."</p>
<p>Very restrained, she said, "It's no hardship, it's my duty to earn the Master's money and cook."</p>
<p>At this moment, the husband suddenly took out five yuan and said, "You are very diligent, I will pay you your salary for next month in advance."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Master."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the husband reached out and pulled her to his side, saying he had something to say to her, and whispered in her ear for a while. Her face flushed, and she just shook her head, pulling her hand away.</p>
<p>The husband still grinned and said to her, "Why are you such a silly girl? It's because the Master sees you in a good light that he wants to favor you. To be honest, Madam is very wealthy and carefree now, but wasn't she the same as you before? After she married me, I often took her out for social gatherings, and that's how she became wealthy. Now who would see her as a maid? You should think about it!"</p>
<p>Xiangxiang remained silent. The husband made a face and walked up to her, "If you agree to me, won't you have more than enough to enjoy when I dump Madam?"</p>
<p>Thinking of home, thinking of herself, thinking of the husband's words, thinking that if she agreed to the husband, wouldn't he abandon her just like he abandoned Madam? She was so scared that she trembled all over.</p>
<p>Xiangxiang trembled and said, "Master, I can't, I can't..."</p>
<p>"You should think about it, you'll never get ahead if you're a servant all your life. If you agree to me, will you still have to worry about food and clothing?"</p>
<p>Xiangxiang shook her head.</p>
<p>The husband became a little angry, "If you continue to be so unappreciative, don't make me angry. Tell me, are you willing or not?"</p>
<p>Still shaking her head.</p>
<p>The husband stood up angrily and snatched the money from Xiangxiang's hand.</p>
<p>"Get out!"</p>
<p>"Get out of what?"</p>
<p>Xiangxiang was stunned?</p>

<p>— Ah Jiong</p>
<p>Around noon, clouds floated in the sky, with patches of black emerging, and a thin mist covered the ground. It was like the scene of deep autumn, with fine rain falling incessantly, and with the mist, it gradually felt thicker. In such a scene, I entrusted myself to the huge ship, leaving my F, arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Because F was waiting for me at the pier, and the time for the ship to depart was very tight, I braved the rain and came out of the house with a heart as miserable as when I left home for the first time. The scenes on the street were still the same as usual: crowds of people coming and going, cars weaving back and forth, trams still running at full speed, dragging forward like long snakes. The autumn wind blew the fallen leaves on the ground, and the autumn rain continued to fall gently, as unpleasant as the plum rain. I followed the rotation of the wheels listlessly and arrived at the Bund wharf, where I and the dock worker carrying F's luggage boarded the ship.</p>
<p>Looking at the vast sea, all was boundless. Where would this small boat carry me? I carried a heavy burden on my back. Would this burden be battered by several storms and not sink to the bottom of the sea? I began to feel apprehensive, and my heart trembled uncontrollably. F held my hand tightly, and there seemed to be unspeakable pain between us, at the moment when this separation was about to come. The whip of life is so harsh! In order to survive, I had to separate from F and drift alone to the strange southern country.</p>
<p>In the sound of the whistle, F stood from the deck to the dock. The gong rang, and the ship seemed to start to turn. Oh, my heart! It was simply too painful to describe! I don't know why, but a feeling of sadness, that it is easy to part but difficult to meet again, surged from the depths of my heart like a tide. I had no power to stop it at all, and I finally cried!</p>
<p>The ship sailed, and in the bleak autumn wind and the misty rain, F's figure standing on the dock finally became too small to see clearly. I said sadly to the sea and sky: Farewell, farewell, Shanghai!</p>

He became a prefect through his literary talent. Who dares to deceive him with his white horse and red saddle. Zhang Xin went to Dongcun to report the news. Mrs. Cui heard it and was dreaming. She regretted her poor judgment in the beginning. She had bullied her husband too much. She rushed to the dock early. It was hateful that bystanders gossiped. How could an official agree to divorce his wife? Water spilled before the horse is hard to recover. The three characters of the Divorce Pavilion still bring pain.</p>

At this time, Director Hong, a wealthy old man who supports the stage, asked Taozhi to perform ten plays, ordering Taozhi to go to the hotel.

<p>At dawn, I leave alone, with no road. Going in and out, high and low, into the misty rain.</p>
<p>The mountains are red, the streams are blue, and the poplar and elm are lush and abundant. Sometimes I see pines and elms all ten spans around.</p>
<p>Stepping on the stream stones with bare feet, the sound of the water is激激, and the wind rises on my clothes.</p>
<p>Life is so pleasant, why must I be constrained and ridiculed by others?</p>
<p>Alas, my party of two or three friends, how can we not return until old age?</p>
<p>Gifting Zhang Gongcao on the Night of the Fifteenth of August</p>
<p>Weaving clouds, four volumes, the sky has no river. The clear wind blows through the air, and the moon spreads its waves.</p>
<p>The sand is flat, the water is calm, and sounds and shadows are gone. Raising a cup to each other, you should sing.</p>
<p>Your song is sad, and the words are bitter. I cannot listen to the end, and tears fall like rain.</p>
<p>Dongting connects to the sky, and Jiuyi is high. Dragons and sea monsters appear and disappear, and apes and squirrels howl.</p>
<p>Nine deaths out of ten lead to the official post. Living in seclusion, silently, as if hiding and fleeing.</p>
<p>Getting out of bed, I fear snakes, and eating, I fear medicine. The sea air is humid, and insects hibernate, exuding a fishy and foul smell.</p>
<p>Yesterday, drums were beaten in front of the state office. The heir emperor succeeded to the throne and ascended Kui Gao.</p>
<p>The amnesty decree travels ten thousand miles in a day. Crimes from capital punishment are all pardoned.</p>
<p>Those who were exiled are recalled, and those who fled return. Washing away blemishes and cleansing the dynasty.</p>
<p>The state family submits the name, and the envoy family suppresses it. Unfortunate, I can only move to Jingman.</p>
<p>The judge's official is lowly and unspeakable. I cannot avoid being whipped and covered in dust.</p>
<p>My contemporaries mostly take the path to the top. The road to heaven is secluded and dangerous, and difficult to catch up with.</p>
<p>Stop your song and listen to mine. How am I different from you?</p>
<p>The bright moon is especially plentiful tonight. Life is determined by fate, not by other things.</p>
<p>With wine, why not drink under the bright moon?</p>

<p>The Songfeng Singing Troupe, founded by Mr. Hu Shuxin, has been well-received by listeners since it began broadcasting on Shanghai Radio. Due to the development of the troupe's affairs, it plans to recruit male and female members from today onwards. Anyone who loves music or is good at singing, please register with the Songfeng Troupe at No. 24, Xincheng Lane, West Simon West Warehouse Road, for a scheduled audition.</p>
<p>The entire "Sister Flowers" broadcast script, compiled by Li Changjian and published by Yuanchang Advertising Company at No. 323, Anna King Road, La Fayette Road, this city, has been popular since its publication. The book has recently been scheduled to be broadcast by the Li Changjian Broadcasting Troupe from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM every evening at the Yuanchang Radio Station (frequency 1120) affiliated with the company. In order to treat the listeners, Yuanchang Advertising Company has decided to make a big sacrifice this Sunday (i.e. the 25th). All those who purchase a copy of the Sister Flowers book from the company on this day will have a special discount of five corners, and will also receive a set of guest hall couplets written by Mr. Li Changjian. This offer is only valid for one day and will not be offered again the next day. This is a golden opportunity that only comes once in a thousand years, and it is also the goal of Yuanchang Radio to treat the listeners.</p>
