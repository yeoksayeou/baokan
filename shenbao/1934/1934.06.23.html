<p>（華盛頓）美聯社今日得可靠消息、明年舉行之海軍軍縮會議、展期至一九四○年舉行一事、現在嚴重考慮中、現在世界多事、遠東尤甚、如明年舉行會議萬難有何成就、若干外交及海軍方面、因討論展期五年之議海軍軍備之减縮、本來希望甚微、益以最近發生之種種事件、更使此極微之希望、亦舉而盡之、據倫敦消息、英國亦擬擴張海軍、則會議前途、已極端悲觀、若干方面建議展緩舉行會議或爲延遲各國對於海軍政策、作最後决定之最好方法、各國於一九四○年以前、可預爲設法於政治上互得諒解、美國方面爲預防計、亦可擴展海軍至倫敦條約所許之限度、蓋至一九三六年底美國去條約限度、將祇少軍艦八十五艘矣、再會議展緩之後、倫敦條約所定之五·五·三·比率、當仍舊保持、日本要求增加比率之議、亦可無需提出、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本對明年之海軍軍縮會議、以不受華府倫敦兩條約之制限、不討論政治問題爲前提、採參加之方針、但最近盛傳英美官方反對日本要求廢棄比率恊定、果爾、則日本欲貫澈主張殊爲難事、廣田外相以英美如否認關於根本問題之日本主張、則明年會議或决裂、或致日本退出、二者必居其一、故以深甚之注意、注視英美之眞意、視形勢如何、外相本人或親與駐日英美兩大使分别爲預備會議、闡日本之主張、蓋外相表示有積極出動之意、（二十二日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）現在美國發生一種輿論、略謂下屆海軍會議旣無成立希望、當無召集之必要、不如延期爲愈云、又如美代表在倫敦亦於二十一日露出上項非正式之意見、唯此項情形、駐美大使齋藤及駐英大使松平對於外務省尙未發出公電、在外務當局、則以明年之會議並無延期之理由、且　下屆會議之圓滑發展起見、旣經參加該項預備交涉、不料反弄此種言辭、殊屬意外、且預備交涉尙未發見任何具體方案之今日、而由具有權威之代表團放出正式會議不能成立之空氣、實未能使人置信、但日本則根據現行條約、至一九三五年止、較諸與英美雖得保持其相當比率、但至一九三六年、則爲老齡兵艦及其他情形低至六成以下、倘仍舊依照現行條約、當然斷難屈服、處於此種實况之下、故一九三五年之會議、勢非召集不可、並擬要求改正現行比率、亦爲當然之方針云、（二十二日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）倫敦之軍縮豫備會議方漸有端倪、忽美國之一部份政界、以遠東政治情勢混亂爲理由、主張軍縮會議延期至一九四○年、此意見實頗堪注目、日外務當局對此之意嚮如下、倫敦軍縮會議之際、若槻全權之所以簽字者、因倫敦條約爲至一九三六年之暫時恊定、僅有暫定的效力、且締約國於一九三五年之軍縮會議、規定可以自由之立塲參加與會、故會議延期實可謂違背華府倫敦兩條約之精神、美國之希望延期、因一九四○年時、建艦計畫已全部完成、保有世界第一之實際勢力、將藉此以抑壓英日等之要求、但此自己本位之態度、實有碍會議之成</p>
<p>功、遠東和平之獲保全、在英美承認遠東政治之自身、而可與海軍問題分離者、雖軍縮會議延期、而美國若採取將日本之遠東問題與軍縮置諸天秤等之態度、恐恊定萬難成立、因此外務當局並不重視軍縮會議之延期、同時海軍方面亦以爲此乃利己之議論、付諸一笑、（二十二日電通電）</p>

<h3 id="c63">再論救濟漁業 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 潔芳</p>
<p>漁業之重要。晚近已爲舉世所公認日前本報嘗論吾國漁業之奄無生氣及所以救濟之道。意有未盡。爰再陳之。以當補充。</p>
<p>邇來吾國水產界之困苦。已臻極點。言乎漁撈。則海盜起。强鄰侵佔。漁村呈破產之現象。言乎推銷。則魚價低落。市塲紛亂。漁户失金融之調劑。長此以往。漁業之整個崩潰。實則不可免。其間原因雖千頭萬緒而癓結在外三端。　　一爲從事漁業者之知識固陋也。漁民不能開闢較遠之漁塲而祇知競捕於沿岸區域。雖明知漁獲逐年减少。而守株待免。不易陳法。魚商對運銷魚產。始終集中一處。不知將產品擇地支配。更困於魚行之剥削。雖魚價暴落。獲利微薄。而魚產仍循例輸入。魚行對於例行制度。毫不改進。相互競爭祇求本身目前之利。不爲漁民商着想。不知漁民魚商與魚行三者關係綦密脣亡齒寒。理有固然。若漁民魚商而歸於消滅。魚行又焉能獨全。</p>
<p>爲舶來水產品之傾銷也。吾國自海禁開放以來。水產貿易。始終入超。近年各國以水產事業發展。及其國內經濟之恐慌莫不亟謀出路以吾國市塲爲其傾銷之尾　。而就中尤以日本爲甚。每年漏巵　達數萬元　。</p>
<p>三爲日本漁輪之侵漁也。日本近年積極於遠洋漁業之發展其於吾國之海上利權。更多野心。是以吾國沿岸。滿佈侵漁日輪縱橫濫捕獲之魚類卽就近在吾國沿岸各口。削價傾銷。以求早日出售再行侵漁結果使吾漁民辛苦捕獲之魚類。亦不得不低價售出。影響所及每有不能維持生計者年來吾國水産業之日就衰落。固不足怪也。</p>
<p>凡此三端。皆爲促成吾國漁業崩潰之原動力。如欲急謀救濟。則不得不注*</p>
<p>意於下述之方策。</p>
<p>其一曰。漁村之急謀安定也。漁村爲漁業之本。漁村安全。則漁民可以安居樂業。漁民安居樂業。始可從容圖謀漁業之發展。今日漁村破産。與海盜猖獗。實互爲因果者也。蓋海盜之來。一以漁産日减。漁民生計困難。再以土劣榨取。官廳勒索。漁民處於重重壓迫之下。不勝其苦。强者自多民而走險。迨旣爲海盜。則又轉以擾民。循環周流。迄無已時。此漁村之所以不寗也。安定漁村之方。在於治安之維持。漁捕之指導。其進行也。可先劃定漁區。派熟悉海上情形而兼有水産學識者。前往負責指導。全國如能同時並進。其見效自可更速也。其二曰。漁業團體之改進也。吾國向之從事於漁業者。富於帮别觀念。各組含有封建性之集團。如江浙外海之漁業公所卽其例也。惟其工作。祗爲漁民排解糾紛。及以公所名義請警保護而已。此外對本身事業之如何改進。産銷８</p>
<p>之如何合作。盜刦之如何防止。皆漠不關心。而近世社團應有之共同設施。亦付闕如。吾國漁會法早經公布。然全國正式之漁會。祗山東三所。江蘇十四所。浙江六所。福建三所。安徽二所。爲數已極有限。卽其所標榜之工作。亦全未實現。故外海漁民。仍集散無常。不得受團體之益。是亦急應改進者。其三曰。産品之合理分配也。吾國魚産。祗集中於一處。今雖産額慘落。而集中之區。仍感供過於求。遂使魚價降落。無從挽回。守業部近方積極籌設上海魚市塲。聞進行已至相當程度。建築計劃及組織規程等。漸有頭緒。明春可以正式營業。此事實現後。魚産之集散。自可照各地需要。予以適當分配。且鐵道</p>
<p>部亦努力於冷藏車輛之添設。從此沿海魚產。可以暢銷內地銷路旣廣。魚價自高。漁民生活。亦可因以稍裕。惟皮此二事創辦伊始。務須審愼努力否則徒失漁民魚商之信仰。無補事實於毫末也。</p>
<p>其四曰。水產金融之流通也。以我國魚產之集中一地水產金融乃亦操縱於一地方魚行之手。循至漁民經濟營資本。大都向魚行借貸而種種牽制故</p>
<p>漁業銀行之設立實爲當務之急。將來借欵手續可由各地漁會辦理俾易普及於漁民間也。</p>
<p>其五曰。漁民敎育之普及也。吾國之水產敎育行之雖久但外無社會之扶助。政府之提倡。而掌敎人員。又往往不能予學生以切合國情之知識及高深之學問。一般學生在校時。旣少堅强不拔之毅力。出校後復好高鶩遠。不願實地工作。此所以推行二十餘年之漁業敎育。未收毫末之功也。故今日而言水產敎育。實應一變初衷。鈕永建先生已極力提倡漁民敎育。松江縣立之民衆敎育館中。亦具有漁民敎育之設施。隔昨蘇省第六區社敎會議中。且通過注意漁民敎育之議案。是則可爲各省市之模範者也。</p>
<p>其六曰。水產品入口稅率之修訂也。吾國漁業受舶來水產品傾銷之害。至重且大。如能予舶來品以適當之限制。卽予國產品以復蘇之機會。惟在修訂稅則之前。對於各項輸入品。須有深刻之研究。而後决定。否則輸入少者增加稅率頗高。而妨害國產者。反未予取締。則未足謂爲事理之平也。</p>
<p>此外如全國漁業之調查。漁業行政之推進。日輪侵漁之防止。則前評已詳言之。深望爲政者加之意焉。</p>

<p>主席諸位先生、我今天參加經濟信用合作社徵求大會、看到在座的諸位先生、發生一個很好的感想、這個感想、就是上海辦社會事業的人、已有新興勢力出來參加、在過去我們時常看到的在上海辦社會事業的人、來來去去、總是這幾個人、可是我今天却看到了許多生面的、其中固有許多認識的朋友、然而無論認識不認識、我相信今天在座的諸位先生、必不是因情面而來參加、而是因爲對經濟信用合作社有相當的認識與興趣、才來參加的、於此可見上海市參加社會事業的人、已一天增多一天、這是上海一個很好的現象、也是我作地方公僕的對於上海市的前途、値得慶幸的一件事、</p>
<p>中國在閉關自守時代、是一個自耕自織的農業經濟時代、那時人民的生活很簡單、所需生活資料亦很簡單、我們所需要的、我們可以自給、所以那時候、談不到國民經濟生活、譬如我們要吃飯、我們可以自己耕種出來吃、我們要穿衣、我們可以自己紡紗織布來穿、那時的生活簡單極了、但是自從鴉片戰爭以後、外國的大砲、把我們中國的門打開、中國的政治、受了一個打擊、因此打擊、而發生變化、此種變化、八九十年來、還在繼續不停、而國民一般的生活、也因受此大影響、而發生了一個很大的變動、就是生活的革命、但是我們在這將近百年的大變動大革命的潮流當中、我們其實並不曾將經濟組織建立起來、使他合乎近代的經濟原理、所以我們中國在近百年來、雖然天天不停的在那裏變動、而一般國民却仍是不知不覺、不曾理會這時代的波動、我們生活的革命、最顯著的、我們可以在都市中看得出來、只要拿我們在都市的生活、與在農村的人民生活一比較、我們就可以曉得我們的生活、受此世界潮流波動的影響多大、但是我們澈底想一想、我們還是時代的落伍者、我們并不曾順應着時代的潮流而邁進、至於我們的經濟組織、還是很簡陋、大多數的人民、對於近代經濟組織、也没有認識、因此不能發生組織的作用、而許多新的組織、新的計劃、也往往功敗垂成、這是何等可惜的事呀、</p>
<p>我們旣然是能回復到一百年前或五十年前的生活狀態、我們又不能離開都市、到鄕間去過我們老祖宗的生活、我們就得自己來打算、一個人不能打算、就應合起許多人來打算、但是我們一般國民、却祇知消費、不肯生產、好像人們要坐汽車、我們自己不會製造、但是一般人以爲我們有的是錢、人家製造出來的汽車、我們右以拿錢去買、我們要穿西裝、我們自己出的毛織品不好、我們可以去買舶來品、我們的金錢、給人家拿去、都不在乎、只要自己美觀舒適、這些如意算盤、爲個人計、固然打得很好、但是這種如意算盤結果、就會致我們民族於死地、我們不要看别處、只要看看上海、上海從前有錢的人、住三樓三底石庫門的房子、現在有錢的人、他的財富、其實並不比從前住三樓三底的人多、或者多得有限、而他們都要到西區淸靜的地方、去住很新式很完備的洋房、享作是誰都會享用、但是這種享用、將來終有一天、無形中我們的錢完了、深深的陷我們民族於死地、剛才張壽鏞先生報告過、去年我們海關的入超、竟達七萬萬之巨、我們的老祖宗、所傳授我們的唯一本領、就是種田、現在連全國的糧食、都不能自給、還要仰給於外人、其他穿的綿織品毛織品都不必說了、中國是號稱以農立國的國家、中國人耕田的本領、是馳名於世界、世界上不少食米的民族的、耕種方法、大多是我們傳授給他們的、但是現在中國人吃的米、要從外國運來了、這還了得嗎、如北方同胞吃的麵麥、大多也都要靠外國輸入、以致去年一年農業品的入口、在全部入超七萬萬中佔了二萬五千萬元、就是我們穿的毛織品棉織品、也幾達一萬萬元、我們的祖先、萬料不到有這樣没出息的子孫、天天在享用、不知道我們現在在享用、我們的子孫、將來眞不得了、就没有生活的機會了</p>
<p>所以我們現在不但要爲我們自己打算、同時也要爲我們的子孫打算、我們的老祖宗、爲我們的打算眞不少、我們三年前、由北平坐飛機到南京、又到杭州、經過江浙富庶的地方、由空中望下去、看得很淸楚、如農村的組織、河道田畝、道路等等、我們的祖先、都爲我們子孫安排好了、我們不能拿我們祖宗所遺留我們的產業、以及所敎授給我們的生存的本領、來發揚光大、我們眞正是没出息、我們不要害了我們的子孫、我們要能够繼往開來、使我們的子孫、都能够一代一代的生存下去、如果現在我們祇爲自己打算、而不爲子孫打算、將來我們以什麼交給他們、敎他們繼承我們的事業呢、所以我們現在不要盡管享用、不要單爲自己打算、更要爲子孫打算、就十八年前、我由檀香山回來、在船上碰見一個美國老婦人、他告訴我說、我曾到過中國好幾次、年年看見有很多中國學生、到美國去學醫、畢業後回到中國、應爲中國各地的公共衛生打算打算、可是現在中國各地方的公共衛生、還是和從前一樣不講究、他並且說、中國那些由美學醫回來的人、祇知把自己住的房子內、弄得很淸潔、一切衛生設備以及溝渠等、都很完備、但是在房子外面、他就一切都不管、這樣、一個人要講究衛生、固然不錯、但是你一個人衛生、有什麼用呢、須知公共衛生不講究、一個人的衛生、是没有作的、好像閘北地方許多貧民、一切衣食住、都很污穢不堪、每易發生瘟疫、地方發生瘟疫後、我們講究衛生的人、也會受他們的傳染、所以我們全體打算不獨要爲我們現在打算、並且要爲將來我們的子孫打算、</p>
<p>我記得前年、全國女靑年會在滬舉行代表大會、到有全國各處的婦女代表數百人、其中大都來自內地農邨、有一天、請我去演講、我第一句話、就告訴她們、我說各位此次到上海來、參加全國女靑年會代表大會、你們多數是從前没有來過上海的、現在你們忽然到上海來了、看到上海市面是這樣繁榮、人民的生活又是這樣奢侈浪漫你們心中由此而生的觀念、千萬不要錯誤了、要知道、上海現在這樣繁榮、不是眞正的繁榮、上海那種特種階級的人民的奢侈浪漫的生活、也不是他們自己眞正對於社會國家努力貢獻的結果而得來的、這兩點要請各位認識淸楚、切勿發生錯誤的觀念、如果你們看到上海這種假繁榮、以及非己力得來的奢侈生活、發生了錯誤的觀念、那麼你們將來回到內地去作事、也不免要發生許多錯誤、這是我對全國女靑年代表首先所說的話、（參看拙著中國民族之復興與婦女運動刋上海各大報）扶輪社有一次開會就餐、請我去演講、我很大膽的和他們說、上海的繁榮、固是住在上海的無論那個市民所希望的、但是上海已經繁榮到今日這步田地、我們今後的努力、就不應使上海市的繁榮成了畸形的狀態、我們第一步、祇要努力維持現在的繁榮、能維持現在的繁榮、我們將來方可以進一步更繁榮起來、因爲上海今日之繁榮、並非以往上海市民努力的結果、換言之、過去上海市民的努力、不應有今日這樣繁榮、今日上海的繁榮、是很奇怪的、尙有其他的原因、在乎其中、我們知道、一個都市的繁榮、固由於全都市人民、無論農工商學各界共同的努力、有以致之、但是我們以上海市民以往的努力看來、今日的繁榮、是不應有的、所以我說、上海的繁榮是假的、假的繁榮、如何能持久呢、因此、我曾經把上海譬如一魚、魚非水不活、那麼、水在那裏呢、水就在內地各處的農村裏、現在我們農村瀕於破產、則水已涸竭、水涸魚何以生、所以我們要求上海的繁榮、非要兼顧到內地各處的農村之復興、以及農民生計之維持不可、能維持農民生計、而共同把農村復興起來、則水源不致涸竭、上海的魚、遂得賴以活命、這是我在扶輪社所說的話和引證、（參看拙著（一）繁榮大上海之基本原則刋於上海各大報（二）上海市之將來載於新中華雜誌附刋）不過我是地方的長官、也是地方公僕、同時諸位是上海市民、也是上海的主人翁、我在主人翁面前說了上海的繁榮是假的這些話、似乎是不應該的、但是上海這些病態、我做公僕的固應負責盡力去改善、做上海主人翁的、亦應明白、不可諱疾忌醫、所以我今天就把這病態指示出來、希望大家來帮助政府共同來改善、</p>
<p>總之、我們的經濟組織、與國民的生活狀態、雖已經過了很大的變動、而我們的經濟組織、還不能適應近代的需要、没有近代的經濟組織、我們的生活、也就不能變爲近代的生活、現在是分工合作的工業經濟時代、而已不是各自爲謀的農業經濟時代、現在我們的生活問題、已不是自己個人單獨所能解决、我們必須合起大家的力量、來解决大家的問題、大家的問題能解决、則我們各個人的小小問題、也可獲解决、本平等互助的精神、謀各個人共同的利益、以實現集團的生活、這是貴社經濟信作合作社的宗旨、也就是我今天所要貢獻於諸位的結論、</p>
<p>最後、我今天看見在座的許多生面的人、使我非常的高興、我自己是一個地方官、也是一個歡喜參加社會事業的人、我每逢何種客會事業、雖在百忙之中、也是很情願來參加的、所以我今天很高興社會事業中、已參加了許多生力軍、我更希望我每次參加社會事業的時候、每次見到的都不同、務求社會上個個人都來從事社會事業、這樣社會方有辦法、國家也才有辦法、這是我今天貢獻各位先生的一點淺陋的意見、（完）廿三年六月於上海、</p>

<p>— 羅家倫</p>
<p>國立中央大學於民國二十一年重事整理、家倫於是年九月五日到校視事、至今瞬屆兩年、此兩學年中幸賴政府之維持與指導、及全校一致之努力求進、差臻安定之局、而粗樹充實與發展之基礎、家倫於第二學年開學時、曾謂過去一年、學生不但有書可讀、而且努力的讀、敎授不但</p>
<p>有書可敎、而且認眞的敎、茲徵之第二學年將屆結束時之情形、深覺本學年仍能繼續第一學年之精神、而有加無已、建設一國家完善之學府、本不能一躍而躋、目前可改進之處仍多、但此兩年之情形、亦差有可以報告者、爰約略臚陳、以待明敎、</p>
<p>國立中央大學新建之農學院種子室</p>
<p>一·整理院系　本校原有文理法敎工農醫商八院、後經行政院决定將在滬之醫商兩院獨立、尙餘六院、其中系科仍須整理、乃斟酌整理委員會之决議、將繁複之敎育社會系等、從事歸併、而將較切於國家實際需要之學系、如工學院之化工系、農學院之園藝蠶桑等系、予以恢復、計整理結果、尙分六院三丨系科、文學院分中國文學系、外國文學系、哲學系、史學系、社會學系五系、理學院分算學系、物理系、化學系、地質學系、地進學系、生物學系六系、法學院分法律學系、政治學系、經濟學系三系、敎育學院分敎育學系、心理學系二系藝術科、體育科、衛生敎育科三科、工學院分土木工程系、機械工程系、電機工程系、建築工程系、化學工程五系、農學院分農藝系、森林系、畜牧獸醫系、農業化學系、園藝系、蠶桑系六系、</p>
<p>二·整理課程　我國大學課程、往往名目繁多、缺少有機體之組織、本校各院系、爰分别重定敎育方針、將課程亦重新組織、使必選修課目、均有明確規定、不欲因人因事而變更、課程之核心旣能形成、則敎學之意義自可明瞭、此項工作幸賴各院長系主任及授之努力與恊助、經長期討論、屆一年方大體完成、</p>
<p>三·集中學者注重專任　學術本係專門事業、担任敎授者自應專心從事、本校頻年離亂、常感空虛、整理伊始、則極力挽留原有好敎授、而隨時羅致專門學者、凡可得其專任者、莫不請其專任、卽以本學年論、總計六院添聘敎授七十六人、其中專任四十一、兼任三十五、若論其所授課目總數、兼任所授課目不過專任四分之一、至所留原有敎授、亦自以專任爲多、茲不盡舉、目兼任敎授、多係某種特殊科學之專家、係政府及其他學術機關所借重、爲本校所欲羅致而事實上有不可能者、得其恊助本校、自深感謝、</p>
<p>四·增加建築及設備　欲知本校增加建築及設備之不易、當明瞭本校經濟之狀况、在十九年度以前本校預算額爲二百零四萬元、二十年度爲一百九十二萬元（均包括醫商兩院經費、惟二十年度因國難稍有欠扣）、至二十一年度仍爲一百九十二萬之預算、嗣因醫商兩院獨立、除分去其原有經費外、尙由校本部增撥每年二萬四千元、以資補助、於是本校經費、减至每年實領一百六十一萬元、每月向財政部實領十三萬四千一百六十元零、然在此二十一個月期間、建築及設備、亦略有可述者、茲分别兩部分、</p>
<p>甲·建築　學校建築、自多與學術事業有關、或有以爲本校校址旣擬遷移郊外、何必再在原址增加建築者、不知本校新校舍、自現在起計劃移建、至少尙須兩三年、方能完成、而自二十一年秋以至新校舍完成止、共計四五年、在此四五年中、本校學術之進展、自不能保守或停頓、且由經常費項下節省餘欵、以事建築、未得國家任何特别費之補助、或爲關心學術事業者所樂許也、　　一·加建圖書館　二二一·○一五元（共中鋼書架値五五·五○○元）因本校原有圖書館、閱覧室及書庫容量均太小、新圖書館內、大閱覧室凡二、計容五百六十人、分院閱覧室五、納容二百人、合閱報室及現有分圖書室、總共約容一千人以上、較前容量、約大四倍、書庫容量較前大一倍有半、</p>
<p>二·新建音樂敎室　一○·四七九元、此係就梅庵改建、爲藝術科音樂組之用、</p>
<p>三·新建農學院種子室　一七·二六六元、農學院搜集各類品種多至數萬、非有專門建築儲藏、無法研究、</p>
<p>四·新建農學院溫室連設備　九·五三八元、農藝園藝等系研究事業所必需、</p>
<p>五·新建農學院新敎室　卽昆虫研究室、九·七八五元、</p>
<p>六—新建農學院業化學系森林系　蠶桑系農產製造所應出房舍及各農塲塲屋、一八三七八元、</p>
<p>國立中央大學新建之音樂室</p>
<p>七—新建校門　五·三五五元、國民會議時舊校門拆毁、因全校觀瞻所繫、不能不改建、</p>
<p>八·新建實騐學校理科新敎室　二三一○○元</p>
<p>九·重修生物館　一三·七○○元、原有生物館建築太壞、損毁不堪、地下積水二三尺、不能不澈底重修、</p>
<p>十·工學院加蓋新敎室工廠及肥皂廠、六·七九○元、</p>
<p>十一·重修及加建敎育學院（南高院）之敎室及實騐室　一四·五三○元、此爲本校最舊之建築、不能不澈底重修、惟鐘樓因恐牽涉他部、未及修理、</p>
<p>十二·重修法學院（東南門）　七·七○○元、</p>
<p>十三·重修敎習房　五·七八五元、此亦保本校最早建築、破舊不堪、不能不加修理、</p>
<p>十四·重修學生新宿舍　四·七三九元、此房雖係民國十八年所建、然基礎及工料甚壞、祇得修理、</p>
<p>此不過舉其較大及所費較多者而言、已達三六八一六○元、其餘尙有較小建築及興修工程未能一一列舉、約計六萬六千八百四十九元、至於大禮堂建築完工後及付淸之欵以及座位設置之欵亦經付出一萬四千四百五十五元、故在此兩年內、關於建築方面實付之欵、總計爲四十四萬九千四百六十四元、此外尙有新學生宿舍二座、計定標價洋七萬元、正在建築中、可於八月底完成、完成以後、學生宿舍卽可從事整理、俾益學風匪淺、此欵係取償於原有租賃宿舍之押租及租金、茲暫不列入、關於一切較重要之建築、均聘請敎授、組織工務委員會主持、以憑公開决定、而臻完善、</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>當然，太后無論怎樣好的胃口，也斷不會一齊把它們吃下去的，就是嘗也不嘗全咧！平均伊每餐所嘗過的菜，至多不過三四品，餘下來的那些，或卽棄去，或收女官，宮女和那些上級的太監們依次享用。</p>
<p>每餐，太后總是一個人坐着獨享的，不過有時候，伊也敎我陪着伊同餐。丨我却祇能站着吃，不能跟伊一樣的坐着。伊的餐桌並不是一張整幅的桌子，事實上也不能有那樣大的桌子，可以放得下整整的一百碗菜；就是有，也未免太笨了，太后是决不會歡喜的！所以我們有一套小桌子備着，臨時攏將起來，便恰好足够安放那一百碗正菜。桌子問題雖是這樣解决了！然而那些菜和太后相距得得委實太遠了，除掉靠近伊的幾種之外，伊的箸匙都不能够得到。那末太后對這些菜難道眞是可望而不可卽嗎？不不讀者無須爲伊焦急，原來旁邊還有一個專門服侍太后用膳的太監咧！這個太監的名字喚做張德。丨後來慈禧太后賓天之後，這個人便繼李連英而爲淸宮中的總管太監。太后如其愛上了某一道菜，心想嘗試一下的話，便吩咐了張德，讓他恭恭敬敬地端近前來，請太后下箸。可是這端菜的差使，也眞不容易當，一舉手，一移步，都得非常的鄭重。待太后餐畢之後，這些菜便一齊撤下去，聽我們自由取食。其中十分之九，還是完完整整的像供祖先時撤下來的祭菜一般。（六五）</p>
<h3 id="c184">三玉小傳 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>三玉是浙江某中學校工，我們曾經同事過二年。所謂「同事，」並非是有意尊之之謂，因爲校工也是學校裏的主要人物，與校長敎職員學生例應處於同等地位的。</p>
<p>三玉有壯健的身軀，鐵一般有雙腕，更生就一對毛腿。他在學校裏担任「買辦」的差使，從無失職。那校僻處海濱，與最近一個熱閙的市鎭相差約有七八里之遙。爲了送久往郵局及購辦各種應用物品起見，自然學校裏不能不選出一個相當的人才，充當這「買辦」之職。三玉晨而往，午而返；午後又要出差，日暮始回，所以他每天所走的路程，總要有三十餘里，而且櫛風沐雨，無間寒暑。</p>
<p>他雖不識字，可是從來没有差誤過。託他帶東西，祇要對他說明了，他自會同你辦得很是滿意。有時他覺得某物價昂，還會同我們打算，不使我們吃虧。有時他偶然少還一個銅板，我人已經忘記了，可是他仍要找還，不肯揩油的。</p>
<p>每當他挑了一副重重的蘿擔，嘴裏喊着「杭育杭育，」走進校門的時候，全校的人們見了他，都要說：「三玉。你回來了麼？」</p>
<p>某年夏天，我乘輪返里。輪將起碇時，承三玉贈了我二包路點，并道聲「順風」而去，我至今還記着。這點心雖然是很粗的，但是他的盛情眞可感激。</p>
<p>「禮失而求之野。」我們都稱三玉爲忠實拍過一張照片，以留紀念。</p>
<h3 id="c185">重來上海以後 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 秋紅</p>
<p>離别了六年的上海，命運終於驅使我和伊重相見了。朋友們，有的掛了律師牌子；有的掛了會計師牌子；更有幾個是出入汽車，起居洋房了。然而也有幾個是很不幸地在過苦生活；幾乎衣食不周，有家難歸。他們因爲環境改變了，一切和從前都有些不同，而我却還不曾改掉了早晚定要挾兩份報紙進出辦公室的習慣。</p>
<p>没有重來上海以前，在故鄕，我很牽記上海，旣來之後，又覺得不過如此，無足奇也。每天被很高的有柚木地板的屋子範籠了九小時以後，一到夕陽西下的辰光，要緊把身子移到寬闊的馬路上去走動一回了。我挾了報紙，儘揀熱閙人多的地方跑去，滿想抓到一些六年前的上海給予我的印像。可是我終於感到失望，進步很快的上海，大異從前：許多房屋是翻造過了，年紅燈的光芒是到處照射的了，甚至於街頭的賣笑者，也不是從前的一批。</p>
<p>踏進遊戲塲，跳舞廳或歌舞，又是從前所没有的。路旁多了販賣一五折書籍的攤頭，科學靈乩圖的舖張和東洋玩具</p>
<p>的點綴。雖然告地狀的，要銅元的，一如從前，而我所認識的，只有那個而上有些麻，雙目不明的女討飯的。伊的瘦黄的臉兒，還是和從前一樣，似乎並不曾有一絲一毫的改變。也許因爲伊雙目不明，看不見一切的改變，所以伊本身也没有改變給我看見吧。我常常看見伊，常常這樣想，也常常忘記給伊一個銅元。</p>
<p>當我從馬路上走回去，或從遊戲塲裏出來的時候，經過跳舞塲或大戲院的前面，常有一對對的靑年男女，把他們的身子挨進汽車裏去，他們的面上都帶着微微的笑。光陰就在每夜看他們的笑痕中偸偸地過去，屈指算來，我重到上海以後又是兩個月了，一件淡藍色的長衫大襟上，平添了挾報紙而染上的一層烏光。</p>
<h3 id="c186">陳道士 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 同初</p>
<p>誰知一個瘋子，偏討得人家歡迎，他的生意特别興隆。人家有了難療的病症，就興奮的喊：「非請陳道士來做個道塲，念幾本經，挨不下去的了！」</p>
<p>一般人只知他姓陳，誰都不知道他的名字；國因爲是替病家驅鬼除魔，「陳道士」便成了他的大名。他是我鄕的一個紅人，誰都欽敬他，愛護他，並誰都有個戒心：「自己害起病來，就非他不救了。」</p>
<p>他之所以成名，說起來是膾炙人口的。一個夏天，王遠橋的兒子，害了一塲怪病。醫生都回絕了，女巫呢，說鬼說怪，說神說道，說閻王爺除了只要他的兒子外，任何辦法是無濟於事的。此時陳道士毛遂自薦，大言道：「祇須我郎誦一聲經，病勢立轉。」大家都知道他是個瘋子，遠橋怎會信他。後來在虛渺的希冀中，才准他一試。奇怪的！果然病勢轉了，後來漸漸地好了。</p>
<p>「呵，陳道士本領眞大啊！怕是張天師派下來的星宿呢？」</p>
<p>陳道士的手，没有時候不在顫抖的。走路時打着八字式的腿，又平舉了兩臂，一顚一顚，遠看似在打瞌睡。他的言語，從没有淸淸楚楚的說過一句。他的口邊，常掛着唾涎，尤其在吃飯時或站着看女人時，但女人們不因此便逃避起來，反橫送了一個秋波，大家打着一個哈哈：「呵！那個陳道士哪！」</p>

<p>携着手，同着心，像電影中一個跟鏡頭似的他們踏着瑣碎的樹影在這悄悄的小路上走去。初夏的風吹拂着他們的頭髮，輕薄的衣衫，同時幌動着地上的樹影，默默地，偶然相顧一笑。他們愛惜着這珍貴的會面，但是誰都不願傾肚胸中的久積着的話語，在視綫的交投中，好像彼此比言語更明的領悟了。</p>
<p>脚步慢慢地差落了，伊瞥了他一眼，他微笑着重整齊了步伐走向前去。　　「已到了新橋了，恐怕時候不早了吧？」伊注視前邊河面上反映着太陽的橋影，提醒他似的自語。</p>
<p>「我們看落日罷，歸去的時候坐車子。」</p>
<p>伊們踏着小路上的樹影，繼續向前走去。</p>
<p>到了橋邊。並坐在橋的石欄桿上，目光投在寥遠的前方，彷彿賞鑒那落日的餘暉似的，一分鐘，二分鐘，五分鐘，浪費地送走了。</p>
<p>「時候不早呵，你的許多話呢？」伊站起身來整理衣服上的皺紋裝了很自然的笑容問。</p>

<p>「說罷，時候不早了哩！」</p>
<p>「其實不說不是更好嗎？」</p>
<p>「是，我明白你的意思，但是做人太乏味啊！」</p>
<p>他旋過頭來，凝社着伊潮潤了的面目，伊避了開去，「×，太不像孩子說的話了？」他突然捉住了伊的雙臂。</p>
<p>「你還以爲我是個孩子嗎？」頭低了下去，抽噎着。</p>
<p>「快不要這樣，×，」他扶起伊的頭來，聽我說，年紀靑着呢，别被你的環境誤解了你的人生。而且，一個孩子家不應該那樣消極的！」</p>
<p>「我明白你的意思。」微微點着頭，一顆晶營的淚珠從撇着的嘴角邊滾到他的膝蓋上。</p>
<p>「歸去罷，時候眞不早了，」（太陽已全部跌進了河心）他扶伊起來，在鬢髮邊輕輕地說：「你要聽我的話，是我不好寫信給你傷了你的心，想想快樂的事情吧，你還没有到做人太乏味的年齡。」</p>
<p>「你還當我是個小孩子！」伊噙着眼淚顫動着下嘴唇。</p>
<p>「别誤會我的意思！我不是說不懂得「做人」的小孩子，是說你不必去懂得「做人太乏味」的道理，不是嗎，我們都年靑着呢！」</p>
<p>緩緩地踏着歸去的路。初夏的風吹拂着他們的頭髮，衣衫。輕微的步伐滑過，小路上一片糢糊的樹影，漸漸地，兩條人影消失在黄昏的細語中。</p>

<p>恰好在第一道壕附近有了一聲嚮，殷得仁搬動槍機，就向那地方放民幾十嚮。在這陣槍聲嚮後，那邊也有了還擊，正對了殷得仁站的所在射着。殷得仁口裏呌：一千米達，放！弟兄們隨着他的口令，放出了槍去。但是殷得仁因爲由堡外調了進來，心了很感到一種抑鬱不快，這時開了火了，覺得多殺幾個人，才可以痛快一下。因之，自搬了機關槍，半俯着身子，在垜口不跑着，只挑那敵人槍火最多的所在，由垜口射了出去。他有時由東到西，有時復又由西回東，人像發了狂一樣，口裏喊着，弟兄們，沉住氣，看淸了敵人放，當他喊時，敵人帶着的小銅砲，開始向城垜上轟擊了，一彈打到，轟去了兩三截桗口，殷得仁更急了，就在缺口的一邊放好機關槍掃射一陣。敵人正也預備由這裏搶過來，碰上了他這陣掃射，倒下不少。他忘其所以了，伸了一隻右手在空中揮着道：小子，你來就在這個當兒，只覺得半身麻木，手臂上中了彈了。立刻那雙手便有些指揮不靈。這才向一堵垜墻下靠了坐下，將左手挾住了右臂的傷口。他觸着膀臂時，覺得掌心裏都有些粘濕，血流得不少，大慨子彈在手臂上穿過去了。可是他並不讓弟兄們知道，口裏依舊喊道：一千五百米達，放！於是掀起一隻衣角，在口裏啣着，拔出刺刀，將衣襟割下一長塊。當了帶子，微彎了膀子，將牙咬住了襟塊一端，左手執着巾塊，在手臂傷口上一繞，緊緊的紥住，先止住了血然後才定了定神。（四一六）</p>

<p>— 朱運駿</p>
<p>本月九日本刋載有「無綫電寳物探尋器」一則。我在前年冬間曾經做過此事，因Ｒadio　Cran　June　1932　雜志中，有極詳細之說明，且其原理是可通過的，所以我當時就花去了六十多元，購買燈泡等件，如法裝配旣成，試騐二器之功効尙好，就照其角度裝置在內地家祠中，於泥土下面，由另一人用火油箱中貯鐵器，預先埋好，深約二尺，隨用此器探尋，先將器舉高離地兩三尺，果然毫無聲響，及置近地面一尺左右時，銳聲驟起，震耳欲聾，我以爲試騐成功，快活得什麼似的，那知道掘開來一物沒有，很覺奇怪，後來在各地面試騐一樣均能發聲，完全分不出絲毫異狀，纔知道失敗了。但有一點是否因器太靈敏，或者因泥土潮濕，還没有研究澈底。不過在這經濟衰落的時候，恐怕有人貿然試騐。弄得偷鷄不着，折把米，所以拿我經騐所得寫出來，供大家參考。（不殳酬）</p>

<p>廣播電台，公共演講廳及戲院等，每將收音處與放音處遙隔，以收來的音波，用輸送線搬送於他方。經放大器，擴大後而放音，此種裝置，卽稱謂遙控輸送法，此法除避去收音與放音的干擾外，收音室與放音室可以設置在適當之處。例如：廣播電台因架設天線地位關係，不能設在熱鬧市區，對於播音者往返不便，所以宜將收音室，置在交通便利之處，而所收之音波，則以輸送線輸入於播音台。惟音波輸送時，因輸送線甚長，兩線間卽有誘導量及電容量存在；故若直接接於放大級上，則除音質與音量較原處大遜外，復有顫音及雜聲等之弊，挽救之法，卽將輸送綫於未接於放大級前，先加以適當配合。</p>
<p>圖示一遙控載音輸送紅綫的配合法。T1　爲輸送綫變壓器（Transmission　lineTransformer)T2爲話筒變壓器Ｒ１爲２２６歐姆耗阻器，Ｒ２爲７４歐姆耗阻器，Ｒ３爲６７歐姆耗阻器，輸送綫間的特性總阻爲五百歐姆，輸送變壓器至話筒變壓器間須用隔離罩，輸送綫亦須用鉛管隔罩，免除大氣靜電等騷擾，音源自話筒或拾音器輸入Ｔ１變壓器，卽由輸送綫搬送於他方，經Ｈ形耗阻配合平衡器而至Ｔ２話筒變壓器直接於放大器的第一級，此法經美國數度播電台與公共演講廳，及業餘電台採用，謂成績甚佳，用特介紹於此，聊供參考。</p>

<p>— 祺</p>
<p>優良而完美的收音機，不僅靠電力强大，綫路複雜已也，雖普通小規模的收音機，苟能設計周全，製造合法，亦未嘗没有驚人的成績。最近，市上所售的一種無變壓器式收音機，頗受一般人的歡迎，蓋亦以其製造玲瓏，售價低廉所致也。</p>
<p>作者近以業餘之暇，試製了一具無變壓器的兩管收音機，以新式２５Ｚ５作半波整流，（如此則可交直流兩用）而已丨３８號五極强放汽車管作檢波，其效力的驚人，也不亞於４７或２Ａ５等。而這機的經濟，簡單，優美，小巧，實較用變壓器者有過之，無不及，且直流電亦能應用，故頗合內地有直流發電廠者之用。綜上諸優點，均足使此小電力之收音機</p>
<p>，臻於完美之境。業餘同好，曷一試之。茲將綫路刋佈於后；</p>
<p>此機所用的綫圈，因欲使其佔地小的緣故，需繞於膠管上，Ｌ可於一寸半徑的膠管上，用３０號綫繞十五圈，約間二分，再用同號綫繞Ｌ１八十圈，Ｌ２可繞於一寸徑管上，約四十圈。在裝置時，如能排列緊湊，可置於一小型的盒內，以之作袖珍收音機，亦無不可。又因感度頗爲靈敏之故，若用作旅行收音，而不用天地綫，照試騐所知，也可以收聽到很淸晣的音樂。末了，宜注意的就是；初級圈Ｌ，不能與次級圈Ｌ相連，否則易肇危險。此外，各另件容量均詳注圖上，似無庸再述了。</p>

<p>— 江之蕃</p>
<p>無綫電收音機之接綫方法，初似簡易，然其重要性，固不下於綫路及另件</p>
<p>之優劣，初學者自製收音機時，每忽略此點，成績往往不佳，甚至燒壞機件，凡我業餘研究家其注意及之。</p>
<p>（一）另件佈置　接綫第一步工作，爲</p>
<p>佈置另件。佈置妥當，則地位節省接綫簡短，不生無用之感應作用，收音機效力宏大。佈置要點，就直流收音機言，設爲經濟起見，不用金屬底板面板，及隔離罩，則地位應較寬敝爲佳。燈座最好成單行排列，燈絲朝面板，接綫可短捷不少。成音週率變壓器可置於二燈座之間，如有二隻以上，應成直角排列，且應遠離配諧綫圈，最好亦能成直角位置，射電週率放大管應與檢波管遠離，其配諧綫圈更應與檢波級所用者遠隔，並成直角，至於交流機，以上要點，亦須注意。唯交流機每用金屬隔離，復利須注意。唯交流機每用金屬隔離，復利</p>
<p>用多數傍路電容器及阻流圈。故佈置雖狹小，亦能避免感應作用。但電源變壓及濾波器等，皆應遠離射電週率或中間週率電路。綫圈用之隔離罩應爲綫圈直徑之二倍。綫圈與底板及罩頂之距離，各爲一吋。不然，效力反而不佳，同時尙須注意容易發熱部份之排列，如整流管，强力輸出管，電源變壓器等。必使其散熱迅速，且不致烘壞其他另件。此另件佈置之大要也。</p>
<p>（二）接綫手續　（甲）一切接綫，均須絕緣良好。裸綫僅能應用在極簡單之綫路中。通常應用之導綫，以十八號漆紗包爲宜。如高等之短波機，則多用十四號漆紗包。交流機因燈絲電流頗大，故須用極粗之絞合綫，以接燈絲。四極管銅帽之接綫，亦應用粗而絕緣可靠者，因常常拉動，頗易損壞。（乙）直流機接綫以整齊爲條件。綫之曲折處，應作九十度角，而不得將綫上漆包損破，其法可用洋紙一片，墊於尖嘴鉗中，而折曲之，凡綫之接頭，應彎成問號（？）形狀，緊旋於鏍絲上。鏍絲帽最好不用老虎鉗，而應用鏍絲帽套頭轉之，以免損壞。（丙）交流機接綫以直捷爲宜，故綜錯縱橫。導綫往往彼此接觸，同時電壓較高，故須注意綫之絕緣性。直流機最好能用銲接，而交流機非銲接不可，因另件中如固定電阻，固定電容器等，不</p>
<p>銲接，則無法可使之接觸牢固。（丁）接綫應有秩序，按步就班，方不致錯誤。一般接法，先接燈絲，再屏回路。柵回路，簾柵回路，天地綫回路。經騐較少者，最好採分級接法。先依上述秩序，裝好檢波級，試聽滿意後，再加成音週率放大級，又經試聽滿意，最後再加射電週率放大，如是裝置，最易成功。（戊）接綫最好用五色線，不但美觀，且檢查便利，不易錯誤，是亦一高尙收音機必備條件。一應用，燈絲用黑色（一）屏回路用紅色，以示高壓。柵回路用黄色。簾柵回路用綠色。　　（三）小要點　以下各要點，不得忽略，否則，其結果將使君懊喪。（甲）另件在裝置以前，須細細檢查。（乙）凡應與金屬板絕緣之另件，務使絕緣程度，非常可靠。（丙）在裝置變量電容器時，先將動片完全旋入，以免碰壞。（丁）交流機所用之固定電阻及管狀電容器等，最好先將其有關係者數枚作一粗。將用蠟熬過之小方形厚紙，將其互相接牢於紙之二面，則接線短，地位小，不致紛亂不堪，東彎西曲。此種接法，舶來品中，無不用之。（戊）接線用導線，須配好長短，折曲之，剪斷之。寗稍長，毌過短，過短反浪費。（己）直流機之柵回路與屏回路接線不可靠近或並行，否則易生感應作用。</p>
<p>總之。接線工作，非常重要，雖小節，亦不可忽略。然後方有成績可言。業餘研究家，其三致意！</p>
<p>美國無綫電公司大减價　南京路三六二號史德華公司，公館馬路三八六號，湖北路一六二號，及東百老匯路三一六號史德華三分公司，同時舉行特别大减價，凡所有著名美國名廠史德華及吉而文收音機，皆照原價特别削售，至負責保用，凡未備收音機者，大可卽備一只。又該南京路虹廟東首總門市部，新裝設最新式巧小冰極冷氣裝置，於夏季顧客惠顧，舒適異常。聞該項設置甚爲經濟，住宅寫字間均可裝置，想當日參觀者必甚踴躍也。</p>

<h3 id="c194">關於大衆語文 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 胡愈之</p>
<p>在我們這個社會裏，幾千年來一向佔着支配地位的某一個社會層，眼見得是在很快地没落了。跟着這社會層的没落，凡是代表這社會層的一切文化丨哲學，道德，敎育，法律，戀愛觀，文學，藝術丨也都在没落的過程中。代表這社會層的意識的語文，自然也没有例外。</p>
<p>要是五四運動，在别的方面，没有多大的貢獻，至少在語言革命上，却已把支配階層的營壘，打了一個落花流水。五四文學革命的領袖們，雖然並没有認識淸楚社會的使命，但一方面實佈「文言文」的死刑，不意識地繳了支配階層的文字的械，另一方面因「白話文」的大量的實際的應用，使文學不再成爲大衆的禁地。因此，對於支配階層的語文的没落，和大衆語文的產生，五四運動，確實起了不少的推動作用。</p>
<p>但是這没落的社會層，决不是毫無抵抗，就甘心没落的。代表這社會層的語文，和代表這社會層的一切文化一樣，到了一個相當的時機，必然地要死灰復燃的。而且五四的文學革命，本來就没有幹個澈底，只是把「文言文」和「白話」對立起來，對於文學接近口語這一點，盡了一點力量，却把中國文字主要的病根丨代表古代的封建的意識丨輕輕放過，同時對於新的大衆語言的建設，要缺少努力。因此就給這判决死刑的中國舊語文，暗下裏留下了一條活路。</p>
<p>果然，到了目前，跟着政治的社會的復古傾向，中國舊語文的鬼怪，又重行出現了。這些鬼怪却裝着四種不同的形式來露臉：第一種保持着本來面目，就是近來所謂「文言復興」運動。第二種是穿着「白話文」的外衣，惜尸還魂。（例如禮拜六派的文章，張恨水的小說，都用「白話文」的形式，表現没落社會層的意識。）第三種是混入「白話文」的中間，如許多流行的作品，在形式和意識上，不免有時露出没落語文的狐狸尾巴。（樂嗣炳先生是最忠實於「白話」的。但是不幸得很，前天自由談所登樂先生一篇不滿一千字的文章，却有「繫鈴人自動的解鈴了，自鄫以下：：」兩個古典。這不過是一例。樂先生如此，「自鄫以下」自然更不必說了。可見死文字是到處在作怪的。）第四種是戴上了「風格」「性靈」「語録體」這些面具來出現的。這種鬼怪雖然最乖巧，但是主要作用，是傾向語文的復古，却是十分明顯的。</p>
<p>這四種鬼怪，連合起來，表面的力量是可怕的。但在實際上，這些都只是没落的語文的前後掙扎。無論怎樣掙扎，都不能挽回没落的運命，爲的是使用這語文工具的社會層在没落着，這社會層的意識也在天天没落着。因此，在敎育上儘管提倡「文言」，但「文言」所包含的意識消滅了，「文言」就愈高愈不通。至於社拜六派的借尸還魂，到底没有多少影響。提倡性靈文學或語録體的，終究也會露出原形來的。</p>
<p>健康的人是不怕鬼怪的。没落階層的没落語文，是不會有多大前途的。橫在我們前面的主要問題，却不是反對「文言文」，反對「語録體」之類，而是積極地改善建設大衆的語文工具，建設供大衆應用，代表大衆意識的語文。</p>
<p>因此對於陳子展陳望道先生提出的大</p>
<p>衆語文學，我是感到有重要意義的。不過在這裏我有一些意見，和兩位陳先生不完全一致。我以爲：</p>
<p>（一）「大衆語」應該解釋作「代表大衆意識的語言」。「大衆語文」和五四時代所謂「白話文」不同的地方，就是「白話文」不一定是代表大衆意識的。而大衆語文却决不容許没落的社會意識，混進了城門。</p>
<p>（二）「大衆語文」一定是接近口語的。但是絕對的「文話合一」當在話的組織有相當進步的時候。</p>
<p>（三）中國語言最後成爲大家用的最理想的工具，必須廢棄𧰼形字，而成�</p>
<p>爲拼音字。因此在目前詞的連寫，筆箱字，國語音標，都値得提倡，因爲這是促進中國語文拼音化大衆化的一種步驟。</p>

<p>— 由薇</p>
<p>這樣的劇本，是非常値得我們多事之秋的中國靑年，化許多工夫去排練它，表演它，以實現這劇本底舞台技巧之優美嗎？其於　費時間，和女人閒着無事去燙頭髮，穿高跟鞋，穿長旗袍在地上拖，使得扭着腰肢走路，屁股打花好看，有甚麼分别呢？</p>
<p>固然，它底好處也說明了戰爭的殘酷。但，我却以爲它這點太說少了。</p>
<p>至於這次的表演，我第一句要說的是：丨佩服商學院同學底精神！以四個人來表演這樣沉重的三幕劇，這種苦勞與努力，是很値得佩服的。</p>
<p>以飾貞勒的胡茗仙女士演得最好，她一出塲，她底舉止，動作，神氣，面目的表情，就像磁石般把我吸住了，使我愉快而緊張。她演得很優閒，鎭靜，溫存的少婦型，聲調好，伶俐，尤其眼睛會表情。只是走路不大方，後來不如起初時演得精彩。本來她飾的這個脚色，是非常難討好的，而她演來那樣動人，足見她表演的天才。飾父親的满齊强君，他底神光亮亮的眼睛，會表情的嘴臉，是很能演戲的，他演的麥甫老父，非常賣力。飾安特烈的周懷久君，演來許多地方都不够，譬如他一出塲看到四年離别的愛妻，該是多末狂喜，緊張？而他並没做到。凡是溫柔，緊張，深刻，熱烈，煩悶處，他都没有做到水平綫以上，只有兇狠的地方和丈夫架子，倒還演得像樣。最後要說到飾女主角的史濟雲女士了，這次的演出，不能生龍活虎般，像劇本一樣活躍傳神，微妙微肖地顯示於觀衆前，我以爲史女士的不會表演，要負一大部分的責。她只會笑，表快樂的地方還過得去，表純樸的地方還可勉强，表悲哀的地方簡直不行，她没有具備着悲劇主人公的情熱，她不覺得悲劇主人公是要怎樣的情熱去處理悲痛的劇情，是要浩大的魄力去描畫悲劇的情緒，還要澎渤的感情傳出使觀衆哭笑皆非的神　。總之，她不是演悲劇的人材、甚至天眞活潑的地方都不够，多少溫柔嬌艷的地方也忽略了。起初，當安特烈歸家的時後，她没有狂喜，緊張，熱烈地去擁抱他；幾次多番要投在他懷裏也做不好；放聲大哭也不像。第二幕閉幕時讀着美國軍官呌她同走的信，她没有驚愕，私喜，難過等表情，更是一個很大的失敗。第三幕閉幕前，勒郎施自櫥櫃邊悲絕地走到火爐前的表演，也不像。當她搖晃着走到安特烈前，呌着：「啊，這間屋子，這火爐，這些給我們用慣了的東西：：啊，安特烈！」這時的表情，她該多末悲痛欲絕，狂哭又繼以狂笑，聲音和身體都發抖？必須這樣，才會感動人。然而導演先生没有把握着這些重要關鍵，她便没有做到這些。眞可惜！</p>
<p>總之，導演對於全劇的緊張處，都没有呌演員拿出魄力來。又總之，這次公演，大體還過得去，演員都是有希望的，只要肯努力。</p>
<p>舞台照明不好，第三幕孄太黑。</p>
<p>服裝上也有疎忽處，那樣的冬天，貞勒却穿黄色紗衣，勒郎施幾個朋來，總是那件菲薄的單衣，又始終是穿白鞋，旣然幾次痛哭，也不拿一條手巾，這些雖是小節也應該注意。　　對白有些文言，方言，非舞台上適用的語句，這是劇七的譯筆，有些非戲劇的用語之故。可是演員和導演，應該把它改成很明瞭很普通的話才好。</p>

<p>現實的事物，終不如理想的幻境，來得没有缺點：我想，這只要是閱歷稍深的人們，都不會否認的吧！這可不是我倚老賣老的私言。</p>
<p>儘管是文人學士如何的利用着他們的生花之筆，或如簧之舌把有些地方的風景，宣傳得妙入仙境，描畫得如　世桃源，然而「盛名之下」，總多有「其實難副」之恨。所以提到「桂林」，立刻浮現着「山水甲天下」的幻影的人們，在我就深深地替他們感到失望！</p>
<p>自然，桂林未嘗没有她的美底特點；然而這是靜寂的美，她的時代早成了歷史的陳跡。因爲她還是中古的城池，住在那裏的人們，無論他們的職業怎樣，映在我們眼簾裏，他們總是表現安閒鬆懈，悠悠不迫的樣子。一點也用不着懷疑，這環繞桂林城的甲天下的山水，當然靜寂如古畫了。不管這些山水，如何的充滿着「自然之美」，只要是過慣都市生活，或者甚至厭倦了都市生活的人們，必然有隔世之感！而桂林山水也都可以入畫；但是只要住上十日半月，慢慢地與時俱增的會感到你是在沙漠中，而且必然地要哼出，長此下去，會渴死呢？這原來風景也有時代性哪！</p>
<p>那末，桂林的山水，畢竟是怎樣的呢？</p>
<p>先說山吧！</p>
<p>桂林一帶的山，類多石壁嶙峋，　岩峭拔，奇峯突兀，望之如人工砌成，山雖童濯，色實蒼翠。城內有獨秀峯，在舊皇城之後，山高十餘丈，拾級而登，城市田園，歷歷在目，惜污濁特甚，　溺遍於山頂，獨秀一變而爲獨臭了。城北桂山，又名風洞山，山有石洞，貫穿東西，冷風習習，雖溽暑過此，都會頓覺悶氣全消。渡河有普陀山，月牙山，七星岩等勝地，山皆有洞，而偉大當推七星岩，岩洞甚深，白畫非燃燭不能行，岩內石節突出，泉水淅瀝，陰森冷颯，鬼氣襲人；洞長二里許，貫通南北，然其中有一洞，相傳可達湖南衡陽，這雖是那些引導人的讕言，然足見此洞之深。城南有象鼻山，在灕江江邊，形勢畢肖，尤以其鼻爲酷似。總之桂林之山，幾乎全數都爲火成岩的石山，山必有洞，而構成種種的風景，據我看來，奇特則有之，而絕無偉大意味。</p>
<p>其次說到桂林的水。</p>
<p>桂江又名灕水，環繞於城之北東南三面，水淺灘多，江多細石，淸澈見底，倚岸垂釣，游魚可数。淸澈则有之，而並没有超越於一切發源地之水。</p>
<p>我，因爲在桂林流連的時日略長，對於所謂「甲天下」的「山水」，所感到的美，也只不過如此，舍此之外，殊不敢遇事宣傳，而使一般未歷斯攪的人們，望眼欲穿。至月二十六日。</p>

<p>— 曄子</p>
<p>「小玉被槍斃的消息傳來的時候，我已經病得不知人事。等我病好之後得知這消息倒也不怎樣心痛，我相信這是我從前捉過革命黨的報應。只是我的酒量突然從六碗减到兩碗，我的氣力也衰了，面貌也老了。我的性情也變得糊里糊塗，有時候心裏没有一點感想，只是莫明其妙地想哭。有時候把過去的事完全記了起來，就要逢人講說。有時候我在大街上遇見莊四爺，我也拉住他講我的故事，講到他到我家來對我拱手稱太老爺時，他往往面紅耳赤。哈哈，他莊四爺曾呌我癩頭三是太老爺！」</p>
<p>說到這里，他停止了，把　着的半碗酒喝乾，拾了一粒花生米咀嚼了一會。</p>
<p>「徐先生，講起這樣的事來是傷心的，但我纔忍不住要講，不講反而更傷心。小玉死了六年多，我把這故事講過幾百次了。我覺得並不是我自己要講這故事，好像是小玉要我講似的。小玉生前所說的話，我全記得，而且全相信。他呌我讓她的媽，我依他。他說的關於窮人和富人的道理，我也全說得出。每逢市日，我坐在城門洞下賣山粉腐，一面對鄕下人講這些道理，他們都愛聽，他們還都說我的小玉是好人。這樣，我的山粉腐的生意也好了起來。」</p>
<p>到四五粒花生米也完結的時候，他從肚兜裏掏出十二個銅板，一文銅錢，一個一個地舖在櫃台上。」</p>
<p>「阿仁，錢拿去！徐先生，再會。天晚了，我要替老婆子燒飯去了。這老婆子，該殺的，該殺的，但是我看小玉面上。」</p>
<p>他踉踉蹌蹌地走到街上。看見一隻狗，他大喝一聲，抓住狗的後脚，把它弄到一丈多路之外。看的人又大笑一會，　　散去了。</p>

<p>— 垢佛</p>
<p>無啥談頭，談談名人書畫，弄書畫已經無聊，談書畫更加無聊，</p>
<p>能書畫者，是否便是名人，原是疑問，書畫中名人，有非名人，有現非名人而將來可爲名人，有永遠不能爲名人，名人與不名人，自有世人來批判，處此平等世界，暫且大家名人，</p>
<p>不過在這樣不景氣，而且大不景氣的年頭，還有什麼閒情逸致，去談書畫，眞是開倒車，不識相，旣無關國計民生，又不是救亡方略，玩物喪志，浪費精神，在頭腦淸新熱血膨脹之流，必定大喊其國家將亡，必有妖孽，國家之亡，全在此輩，</p>
<p>不差，若把這樣的大題目，加在書畫名人身上，到也言之成理，但是我從午夜夢回，把這問題一想，還有些不對，日本以區區島國，自明治維新以後，不數十年，一躍而爲世界頭等强國，而其國內，研究古董的，研究書畫的，比我們還要澈底，還要追求，就歐美列强而論，對於藝術，亦日新月異，精益求精，國家强弱，不關古董書畫，其例可以證明，</p>
<p>我國爲五千年文明古國，古董書畫，自有其相當價値，早爲各國所共許，并且所謂古董者，均由新而古，由古而更古，時代相承，而古董書畫因以勿替，若僅有老牌古董，而無繼起之新牌古董，則古董書畫，不幾絕跡於世，</p>
<p>事之優劣，不在事而在人，我國不少留學過的洋博士，不注研究古學的老宿儒，他們搖身一變而爲賣國賊者有之，搖身一變而爲漢奸商者有之，搖身一變而爲帝國主義走狗者亦有之，這種人說他不時髦不能說，說他不識時務，不能說，</p>
<p>書畫我人，雖無補國家，但亦無損國家，并且書畫名人，絕少雄略蓋世之士，卽使不弄書畫，對於社會國家，亦决没有其他偉大貢獻，還是研究研究書畫，消消閒氣，或者他日陳列博物院中，以供易培基之流，盜賣盜賣，倒也未始不可，</p>
<p>我國書畫一無研究價値，此言吾不敢信，不然，外人何儍，不惜巨額金錢，收買我國書畫，所爲何來，我國國勢的不景氣，所以連古董書畫，亦一齊倒霉，因爲古董書畫倒霉，一般研究古董書畫者，亦因而大倒其霉，正是冤哉枉也，天地良心，</p>
<p>百工居肆，以成其市，社會於以形成，國家亦是如此，有政治手腕者，儘可去談政治，有軍事學識者，儘可去談軍事，有科學法律頭腦者，儘可去談科學法律，有書畫嗜好者，不妨去談書畫，若把亡國的大題目，完全加在一般書畫名人身上，書畫名人，亦當向藝術的老祖宗呼冤，</p>

<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>初夏的風從南國吹來了那樣一個好消息之後，我每天地等候那個偶然的日子就是今天。菲無論如何離不了第二故鄕的上海，離不了需要她的上海朋友。但是使我不得不想起我們認識以後的情形，那三角形的悲劇，我們費了絕大的毅力纔從這旋渦中逃出來。如今她從廣州受盡了磨難歸來，及至加入我們的集團後，不知又將開展怎機一個局面呢？她是個豪放的女子，或者把以前的種種遺留在廣州而開始我們的新生活：但是女子終究是女子，她的靑春已跑到光榮的末端，卽使她决不再願嘗試那戀愛的苦杯，一個舉目無親的女子她是否會不想到她的歸宿，我們這集團之中的任何一個人，能否爲她解决這樣無困難的問題？廣州的朋友不能安慰她，上海的朋友以什麼去安慰她呢？到上海來，還是使她感到重大的失望！想起了這些時，又希望她不要重歸上海。</p>
<p>入夏以來，偶然下了一天雨丨這眞是個偶然的日子，俊的電話來，他說菲已到了上海，因爲我搬了家，她撲個空，她現住在××飯店，要我工作完了之後速卽去。雖說希望過她不要再來上海，聽見了這消息，却覺得是很可喜的事，從辦公處出來，抱着空肚子跳上黄包車到指定的地方去了。</p>
<p>車子在霓紅燈停下來，想起我們離别的時候也在這裏分散的，一陣輕微的悲哀襲上我的心頭。乘電梯到五層樓上</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>，叩以俊告訴我的房間，冲出門來的第一個正是菲，而送走她時的許多朋友我是最後一個到了，一時好像我闖入了另一個快活的世界。</p>
<p>菲没有變，除了臉色微黑，受了南國的風的洗禮，她抓住了我的手臂，提防我逃避似的，俏皮地端相着我的臉說：</p>
<p>「阿×，吃了排骨醬（被上屬責罵的意思）嗎？」没有說完說像喘不氣來般的縱聲大笑。</p>
<p>「菲，我病啦！」我故意放低了聲音咳起來。</p>
<p>「眞的？」她旋過頭去目光從每個人的面上掃過，但是誰都裝着正經面孔，她拉着我坐到沙發裏，拍着我的肩頭，</p>
<p>「阿×，你太辛苦了！，」就再接不上話，頭倒在沙發背上。</p>
<p>一陣不預料的笑聲將她受驚地抬起頭來，她睢見我也微微地笑着，忙拭着眼睛，恨恨地把我一推跳起身，在臺上掏了烟捲獨自抽烟，好像不願意理會任何一個人似的注視着噴出來的烟圈。</p>
<p>我把她拖了過出「菲，怎樣？不願意見咱們嗎？」我同時對大家說。「咱們應該活快，咱們的菲歸來了，今夜瞧漁光曲去，比跳舞塲裏喝白蘭地有意思！」　　「比跳舞塲裏喝蘭地有意思？」我重覆了一句，抓住她的雙肩。菲終於笑了，一個旋身逃去了我的掌握，烟尾向窗外摔去，抓过她銀鈴的錢袋，舉得高高地說：「我請客！」</p>
<p>「歡迎猶太富翁！」兩張手從角落裏舉起來。</p>
<h3 id="c221">驢子及其主人 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 文里</p>
<p>搬到新屋來，第一個給我深的印象就是弄堂口那馬路上閒人在跑馬那些出租的馬匹拴在馬路口荒地上的竹籬邊，其中有一匹驢婦雜在馬匹裏頭，每天總是嗚咽似地在哀鳴。牠的哀鳴的聲音，一聽，使人神經末梢在發抖。這種聲音又使我回想起前年在×地的生活來。在那裏，公衆的廚房用了四匹驢子在拖磨打麥子，一放出來休息，牠們拴在柳樹下被太陽晒蒸得喘氣不過，就競賽似地互相哀鳴起來。我在那裏最怕聽到牠們的哀鳴，有時没辦法避開，只好用兩手掩住自己的耳朶。可是任你怎麼的掩住耳朶，牠們的哀鳴總是鑽進去敲動耳膜使你十分難過。現在每日走過馬路口，又難以避免地被牠驢子的哀鳴，攪得心裏酸溜溜地起了哀感。而這哀感并不是有什麼可以使我悲哀的事物的對象發生的，只是一聽到牠的聲疸就難受。</p>
<p>那驢子是一匹黑驢，背上有一大片白毛，磨難太過而又吃喝不够的緣故吧，瘦得只看見骨頭，而兩隻眼睛晦澀無光之外還流着白水，丨是一隻老的病驢，在牠旁邊的幾匹馬雖然不是壯健雄偉的好馬，可是牠是一隻老的病驢，相形之下，牠是如何的衰老渺小的呵！難怪牠要哀鳴，丨我這樣地心裏測想着。</p>
<p>那驢子的主人，偏又是一個駝背矮小的老人！他逢着行人經過他的身邊對於他的驢子停足加以注目的時候，他總是賠了笑臉鞠一鞠躬將身傾斜個六十度角的姿勢向人道，「騎驢子，阿要？騎驢子阿要？」而每每被人報之以冷眼，不聲不嚮地走他的路去了。我有一次就被那驢子的哀鳴吸引了去，心想要看看牠爲什麼要那麼的慘呌，正在停信脚步對牠注意端詳的時候，那老頭兒令我一個不提防地慘聲慘說地喊道，「騎驢子，阿要？」我捨開了那驢子的注意，轉頭去看看牠的主人，他的灰白的頭髮之下，是一張枯疲焦黄的瓜子臉，灰白的眉毛，灰白的鬍子，還有灰白的眼睛，鄒紋在他的額頭嘴角刻着一生勞苦悲慘的痕跡。無表情的呆相，要笑要哭似地說話，使我在心坎裏共鳴起了同情；生活的鐵鞭敲得他背也駱了，毛髮鬍子也灰白了，他還是爲了生存而在掙扎。</p>
<p>一個穿着小學生制服的孩子，約莫八九歲閙着他父親那穿西裝的紳士要騎馬，那老頭兒陪着笑丨還是那一副要笑要哭的表情丨對他說，「騎驢子，阿要？」他父親說，「騎驢子，馬太兇。」可是那孩子偏要騎馬，他看輕驢子，說，「髒死了，又小，我不要。」他父親說，「馬太兇，你不會騎，跌死你。」孩子哭鬧起來了，「驢子跑不快，我不要。」他父親哈哈地大笑，「跑不快，不要！」孩子說，「馬跑快，我不怕，丨那人不是牽着牠在前面走嗎？」丨父親要他騎驢子、這在老頭兒方面簡直是再好没有的機會了，他老頭兒趕快奉承地說，「我這驢子會跑快，比馬還快，」比馬還快，這話是只能哄小孩子，紳士一聽又哈哈地大笑，笑他扯謊，可是那孩子也不肯受騙，狠狠地對老頭兒說，「我不曉得？馬比驢子更快呢。丨爸爸，我要騎馬。」不知道紳士是不是嫌他老頭兒說話不老實，還是愛惜自己的兒子，聽孩子的話，被他拖到一匹大馬面前去了。老頭兒是失望了，可是他的表情上并不在乎，又逢着過路的人便問道：「騎驢子，阿要？」丨他是受慣了人們的冷落，什麼冷感的刺激已經打動不了他的麻木的心靈了呵。</p>
<p>我每一次走過那裏，總是聽到那驢子呌得我的神經末梢在發抖的哀鳴，同時看到那老頭兒向路人說，「騎驢子阿要？」可是没有看見人家騎他的驢子，冷感刺激不了老頭的心靈却打動了我的，善感的心了。</p>
<h3 id="c222">從烏鴉呌說起 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 水花</p>
<p>絕早起來，凉風和輕烟正統制着這世界，呼吸着從窗外流進來的帶着凉意的空氣，眺望着窗外和看輕烟搖的着綠桐葉，眼前是靜悄悄，心上是迷茫茫。　　不知掩在什麼地方的小鳥在嘰嘰嘰嘰，不知躲在什麼的蛙兒在咯咯咯咯，綠草原是伸長身子在躺着。</p>
<p>「咶咶咶咶」，突然幾個黑影子劃破灰蓋的天空衝了過去，一陣陣咶咶咶咶的聲音洒下來，黑影子已飛遠了，但咶咶咶咶的聲音已將我澄淸的心頭打起波紋，這一半是爲了這聲音來得很突然，一半自然還是傳統的下意識作用，丨丨因這是所謂不祥的鴉鳴。</p>
<p>思想的渦紋散開了；我想到迷信鴉鳴不祥當然是件雖無討論餘地的事，可是我覺得從這迷信中是表現着人們的多少自私。</p>
<p>這還不是自私嗎？烏鴉呌不過是鳥鸦呌，可是人們不承認是烏鴉自己呌，却要說烏鴉是有别種作用而呌：說烏鴉的呌有作用還不去管他，烏鴉在空中呌，聽到它們的看到它們的生物不條多多少少，可是人們却單單說它們的對象是人類：再說呢，烏鴉在空中呌，看到它們的聽到它們的人們又有多多少少，可是每一個人都覺得它們的對象是自己。爲什麼烏鴉呌不烏鴉自己呌而是有作用的呌。爲什麼烏鴉的對象不是其他生物而是人類？爲什麼烏鴉的對象不是别人而是我自己；這種種可以說只是人們的以自己爲主體的自私的原故，</p>
<p>人類眞是一種自私的東西，不但從種種迷信中的自以爲是一切的主體的觀念是自私的可笑，卽使是在日常生活中，人們也永遠是表現着他們是多麼的自私。譬如猜疑出忌妬，怨恨、忿恨，那一種不是自私的結果，都是自以爲是一切的主體，所以對於他人的行動便猜疑</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>他是否看輕我，對於他人的成功就忌妬他是本領不如我，對於他人的忽略便怨恨他是待錯了我，對於他人的錯挫便忿怒他是有意侮辱我，推而至於一切眞的傲慢强橫的以及於一切專制獨裁的，那一種不是自以爲了不得的自私而起，眞是種種煩惱由此生，種種罪惡由此成。</p>
<p>人們，實在是一批可憐的生物呀！</p>
<h3 id="c223">老闆面孔 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 仃</p>
<p>老闆的面孔多怕人，老是那麼氣冲冲的，惡很很的，没有點兒可以和他接近的，或是發生好感的地方。總之，他的面孔，一年三百六十天都是那樣，我從來没有見過他張璍嘴巴笑一笑。我眞怕見他的面孔，不願意見他的面孔，不高興見他的面孔，丨丨假使有可能的話。</p>
<p>我常常這麼想：老闆最好生病，而且病得厲害，老是躺在床上丨丨動都不能够動。這樣，他就不會到店裏來，擺他那老闆的面孔了。這麼着，我便好好的坐在櫃台上，偸偸地看看薛仁貴征東，或者瞅瞅過路的小姑娘，不然，我就和阿四談天，那不是怪得意的嗎！</p>
<p>可是，老天就偏和我作對，老闆不但不會生病，而且身體怪壯的，比我們這班小夥子都壯，我們就没有半個可和他比比，病倒的反是我們自己，那眞苦，生活仍要做，藥那裏來的錢去賣。這麼一來，更加麻煩了，老闆是不管你死活的，生活你總得好好去做。但一個病人怎會好好做事呢？老闆他就不當你是人，他不體貼你，他不會原諒你，他只會顧自己，只會省錢賺錢，壓迫人家，剥削人家。做小伙計的眞倒霉透了。</p>
<p>我天天挨罵，有時也挨過大耳光，我眞氣死了，難道我就不是人嗎？你老闆是人，而我李金就不是娘飬的嗎？你不過是個起碼老闆，一個起碼的資本家，你兇什麼？你威風什麼？我看你會威風到底不會！我眞不服我老闆的氣。</p>
<p>然而不服氣又怎樣？我可能怎樣他嗎！他有的是錢，他是老闆，我是小夥計，那麼，我就得要受他的氣。倘我是老闆的話，我也那樣，我也會扳起老闆的面孔，倘他是我的小夥計，他就得受我的主使，聽我的吩咐，不然，就請你滾蛋！我也會兇的。總之，做老闆就是那樣，没有别的好話說。因爲老闆是老闆，夥計是夥計，我們之間是隔了一道河的。</p>
<p>像這樣的事，我想想眞眞是不對不對。爲什麼偏要那樣？不要那樣成不成？丨丨老闆不要壓迫我們，我們不要反抗老闆！我們大家和和氣氣做生活，那不是大家都好嗎？</p>
<p>但是，可不能這樣啊！因爲這個世界不是這樣，有富翁自然就有窮鬼，有老闆自然會有夥計，大家的身份不同，所以，我想終歸和老闆合不來，而老闆他也不屑和我們合得來，他有的是錢，怕什麼？可是，我們没工做，便會餓死的！我們是靠老闆過活的啊！</p>

<p>— 若望</p>
<p>房東娘病了，不，肚皮裏廂有小寳寳了，不想吃飯，可是想吃酸的，白糖梅子的呌聲會使她興奮，陳玉梅的催眠曲使她想起做母親的味道。</p>
<p>丈夫是有職務的，白天不在家，房東娘獨自在房裏，舒舒服服地躺在床上，陳玉梅的催眠曲把房東娘都催眠了。</p>
<p>偶而房東娘在床上發出一聲兩聲命令丨</p>
<p>「老頭子看門。」丨老頭子是她的爺爺。</p>
<p>「爺叔快點燒飯，阿拉肚皮裏廂餓哉。」</p>
<p>「妹子，替阿拉的褲子洗一洗。」</p>
<p>爺叔像是很歉然，賠笑走到房東娘的房門口。問一問這位女司令，女皇帝要吃點什麼菜。女司令平常不大出言，但不出便罷，言出到在必行。我們也想得到，錢在房東娘手裏，說來没有做不到的，但是爺叔没有錢，没錢祇好吃癟，没錢祇好聽房東娘的吩咐，故而爺叔反而變成侄囝了。</p>
<p>傍晚，丈夫的脚步在門外，房門娘立刻把眼睛閉緊了，裝做睏得没有醒，等丈夫走到房裏息了一會，她才算從夢裏醒來。嬌聲地罵丈夫爲啥回來得這樣晚？</p>
<p>丈夫是美國式的，拿出藏在抽斗裏的水菓剥給房東娘吃。</p>
<p>老頭子看着門，爺叔在廚房忙得面孔上脹起了筋，丈夫忙着剥水菓，房東娘忙着撒嬌。就這麼着天色就漸漸地黑下來了。</p>
<p>「天氣熱了，明天替我剪點××紗來做衣裳，不要忘記。」這一道命令是下給丈夫的，我們也可以想到丈夫一定是惟命是聽的。</p>
<p>但是丈夫也有丈夫的苦處，没有錢的時候雖然很少，但畢竟總有不巧的時候。</p>
<p>第二天的傍晚，丈夫的脚步聲又在房門外了。房東娘把眼睛閉緊，裝做不知道。丈夫照例不敢驚吵，悄悄地在房裏轉，似乎有一點不安。</p>
<p>「爲啥今天回來得這麼晚？」</p>
<p>丈夫剥水菓的皮了。</p>
<p>「衣料呢？」</p>
<p>丈夫把一囊密橘塞到她嘴邊去。拍的給房東娘打掉了，反了一個身，面孔朝裏了。啞！啞！要吐了，哼！哼！眞像病啦。</p>
<p>丈夫坐到床上，替她背上拍，怪耐煩地，一言不發，房東娘彎動着身子，不要他拍，他拍又不是，不拍又不是，眞是没有辦法。</p>
<p>老頭子的肚皮餓的呌了，爺叔時時走到房門口望，一桌子的飯菜都冷了，可是又不敢問。而房東娘的病益發認眞了，僵局無限止地持續着。</p>
<p>老頭子偸着吃肥肉了，爺叔木偶似的没有了主意，可是房東娘倒在丈夫的懷裏了。但是這塲尶𡯓事體怎樣結束呢？丈夫祇得把隱衷告訴她，而意外地得着房東娘的好感。</p>
<p>「你不早說嗎？你没有錢，我這裏有，本來你也不懂看顏色，走，我們同去買。」房東娘的閏似乎消失了，是的，她本來没有什麼病。</p>
<p>終於房東娘跟丈夫一起出去了。</p>
<p>歸途上，房東娘手裏夾着一包衣料，在人稀的地方咬着丈夫的耳朶講，「今天我們住外邊，也像没有結婚時候一樣。」丈夫答應了，但是老頭子却在門口守望着，夜深時候也還是坐着。</p>

<p>— 蔚風</p>
<p>衣食住三大問題，在上海最難解决的要算住了。一個薪給的職員往往將他的所得被住據佔了不少的數目；而且在不盈方丈的斗室之內分配了臥室，櫉房，厠所，稱之爲鴿棚，眞是再適當没有的了。如其一個没有恒產的人，一旦失業下來，實是不堪設想！上海是寸金地，一半是爲了地產掮客的操縱，一半是從農村破產以後大批的人擁擠到都市來，於是從前荒僻之處，現在都是瓊樓大厦了。都市的日漸繁華，也是小市民層剥削日甚。</p>
<p>一個薪給的職員，有時爲了職業地距離關係，在車費一項上打算，他們的家不得不爲了職業的關係而時常遷移，於是搬家的困難常在他們腦海中盤旋。</p>
<p>上海本是個萬惡的淵藪，以前的事實嚇破了二房東們的膽，遂有「非眷莫問，無保不租」等條例出來。當我一個單身漢子到上海來的時候，雖說幸没有做無業遊民，但是租房子一層發生了大大的困難，在離職業地較近的熱鬧區域，卽小小亭子間，租價往往在十元以上，而半夜電燈及全夜電燈等種種所想不到的問題，和二房東們吵嘴。更因一所石庫門內，人物俱備，有時甚於使你晚上不能睡覺，失竊物件等事也時有發生。如其在離職業地較遠的區域租家，車費往往一月之中積成了驚人的出欵，時間上或者又發生了種種困難。</p>
<p>以後薪給較豐，但是單身漢子變了同居生活之後，在住的方面再不能像獨身的時候。雖然亭子間仍可容身，不過妻方面的家族，往來的時候，使你不得不擴大你的居住範圍。而且你的職業地位稍稍爬高了，你的認識的友朋也漸多，於是友誼關係與職業關係，在朋友們來拜訪你的時候，也要使你的居住範圍擴大。臥房雖可以兼廚房及厠所，但是一個女人家往往没有男人這般的便利，如其再兼作會客室，有種種意想不到的</p>
<p>困難發生。</p>
<p>這還是個小家庭的話，假使你擔任了一個大家庭的生活重擔，你的父母姊妹子女，雖是自家人，不能不多隔幾個鴿棚出來，一個薪給的職員不知怎樣來支配他的出欵了。</p>
<p>這就是畸形社會的發展：一方面大飯店，大旅社日漸增多，一方面喝了薄粥的人在擔愁找不到避風雨的所在。不過在表面自然是被繁榮所遮蔽了，許多被壓迫階級是只能忍氣呑聲了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Beining Railway to Inaugurate Direct Train Service to Shenyang on July 1st: Ticket Sales Limited to Beijing and Tianjin Stations; Beining Locomotives Still to be Used on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Section; The Beining Railway Prepares Two New Train Sets <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beijing) Regarding the Beijing-Shenyang direct train service, Yin Tong discussed the matter and decided to implement it on July 1st. Yin summoned Chen Qingwen, the Chief of the Traffic Department of the Beining Railway, to Beijing last night, personally instructing him to actively prepare for the direct train service. Chen returned to Tianjin immediately and dispatched more than ten traffic and ticketing staff to Beijing today, temporarily working at the East Railway Station to prepare everything. It is planned that the ticket sales locations for the direct train service will be limited to the Beijing and Tianjin stations, as the train will be a direct service and tickets will not be sold at other stations along the route. Two new train sets for the Beining Railway are scheduled to leave the factory on the 29th for trial runs. The locomotive will be Beining No. 188, which is currently being driven by the foreign locomotive section chief, Ma Fen, between Beijing and Tangshan to ensure accurate speed. The Railway Bureau has telegraphed Li Binghuang, the section chief of the Shanhaiguan station, to prepare, and has dispatched traffic department staff to assist. The Beijing-Shenyang direct train service is expected to begin on July 1st. When passing Shanhaiguan, the locomotive will be changed, with Beining locomotives still being used on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan section, and South Manchuria Railway locomotives will not enter the customs area. The Railway Bureau proposes not to change the timings of existing trains for the direct train service. It is planned to follow the original timings of Train Nos. 105 and 106. Service personnel on the train, such as the train conductor, ticket inspectors, and workers, will all be assigned by the Railway Bureau, and a chief and deputy inspector will also be assigned. The safety of passengers as the train passes through the territory will be the responsibility of the area through which it is passing. The South Manchuria Railway side, concerned about frequent train robberies outside the customs area, has decided to attach an armored car to the rear of the train to maintain safety. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Railway Bureau has largely completed the procedures for implementing the direct train service. Next, it will proceed with the issue of organizing a core institution. Chen Xiangtao will go to Tianjin within days to discuss organizational methods with representatives from the Beining Railway Bureau and the Japanese International Tourist Bureau. The Dalian head office of the Japanese International Tourist Bureau has decided to send Saito as a representative to participate in Tianjin. Saito is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin from Shenyang on the 25th. Shanghai reports that a Ping-Liao Travel Agency will be organized. According to Yin Tong, the matter will be decided at the Tianjin meeting. What was previously discussed was an international travel agency. Yin Tong visited Shibayama at the Japanese Embassy last night to discuss the direct train service plan. After its announcement, all ongoing affairs will be discussed. Shibayama visited Yin again this morning for a long conversation. Yin said that his meeting with Shibayama was to discuss issues in the war zone, and everything is expected to be resolved after the direct train service begins. Yin is scheduled to return to Tianjin within days. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Regulations for the Beijing-Shenyang direct train service stipulate that the Beining Railway and the South Manchuria Railway each prepare two train sets. After receiving the order, the Beining Engineering Department rushed to complete the construction at the Tangshan Locomotive Factory a month ago. The trains include dining cars, sleeping cars, living rooms, and baggage cars of first, second, and third class. All are light gray in color and identical in appearance. They are scheduled to leave the factory for trial runs within days and will be parked at Fengtai Station on the 29th, awaiting dispatch. Shibayama is scheduled to go to Tianjin within days to participate in the meeting and to visit Umezu, the commander of the garrison army, to discuss war zone matters and related issues concerning the direct train service. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) 20th – This question: The China Travel Service received a telegram from the Shanghai branch stating that Chen Xiangtao's arrival date in Tianjin has not yet been determined. Furthermore, the deputy manager of the company, Zhou Shizhong, met with Zheng Baozhao, deputy director of the Beining Railway Bureau, and others at the Six Nations Hotel this afternoon. The two sides discussed the procedures to be handled for the direct train service. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Information from the Railway Bureau: Xu Wenguo and Zheng Baozhao, the deputy directors of the Beining Railway, have decided to meet with Chen Xiangtao, the manager of the China Travel Service, in Tianjin on the 24th to discuss the organization of the travel agency. Because it is only a procedural matter, the Ministry of Railways has not dispatched additional personnel to participate in the discussions. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Can be Determined After Huang Fu Returns North</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the two units of the war zone security force, Zhao Lei and Liu Zuo, the Japanese side insists on counting them as part of our official security force. The provincial authorities recently based their argument on the Tanggu Truce, which stipulated that both parties agreed to allow us to reorganize these two units after one year. That period has now expired. After the newly formed special police force enters, it is planned to transfer the two units out of the war zone for training. Regarding the issue of the newly formed special police force entering the war zone, the provincial authorities are determined that if they enter, they must all go; if they do not enter, they will absolutely not be restricted by the Japanese side. Regarding the dispatch of a part, Yin Tong is currently busy with matters concerning the direct train service, so it is planned to thoroughly negotiate with the Japanese side next month after Huang Fu returns.

<p>(Beijing) Yin Tixin stated that peace has been restored in Malanyu and that the mutiny of the puppet troops is a thing of the past. Because more than ten officers were dismissed from the puppet troops, more than thirty soldiers were dissatisfied, leading to a small number of mutinies. The matter has now been completely resolved. He will accompany Commissioner Yin to Tianjin within days to discuss the handover of Malanyu. After the Beijing-Shenyang direct train service begins, various issues in the war zone can be resolved smoothly, and the newly formed security force can also enter the war zone.

<p>(Jinan) Zhao Mingyuan, the commander of the militia stationed in Lijin, telegraphed that the bandits who robbed the Shuntian Wheel released the kidnapped foreigners on the 20th in Wangjiahewo, Zhanhua County. He planned to immediately lead his troops to attack. Han telegraphed Zhao that the bandits deeply understood righteousness, and now that the kidnapped Chinese had not yet been rescued, he should first use courtesy before force. If the bandits repented and released all the kidnapped people, they could be allowed to surrender their weapons and avoid death; otherwise, they should be severely attacked. Dior, the British vice-consul, was very pleased to hear that the British had escaped and went to the swimming pool with Han for a bath today, returning to Ping in the evening. Judel, the British counselor, went to Zhanhua. Now that the British have escaped, Judel has also returned to Jinan. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Han Fuju telegraphed Beijing, stating that the bandits who robbed the Shuntian Wheel were former subordinates of Liu Zhennian, who had all become pirates, specializing in robbing passengers.

Today, Sun Danlin, Nicol, Watson, Brand, and others dined with Sir Dryer, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, on the HMS Suffolk.

According to Sun, when he was first captured, the pirates hid everyone in underground caves and then hid everyone separately in civilian ships. The pirate leader interrogated everyone one by one. The pirates mistakenly believed that Sun was a friend of Han Fuju, so they urgently released him at the same time as Nicol, sending them on a sampan. Not long after, they were rescued.

<p>(Nanjing) The National Economic Committee held its ninth regular meeting at 10:00 AM on the 22nd, attended by Wang Zhaoming, Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, and Kong Xiangxi. Sun Ke did not attend due to a meeting of the Legislative Yuan. Secretary-General Qin Fen was also present. Chairman Wang first had Song report on his inspection of the Northwest, dividing it into four areas: water conservancy, highways, health, and rural construction. He gave a very detailed report on his impressions and plans for improvement during the inspection. Qin then reported on the recent work of the committee and its various departments, as well as the income and expenditure statements of the committee's various special funds and a comparison table of budgeted and actual expenditures. The following proposals were discussed: (1) Song Ziwen proposed to change the original Northwest Development Implementation Plan of the committee, which was resolved and passed. (2) The draft Provisional Organization Regulations of the Jingluo Engineering Bureau and the request to appoint Sun Shaozong as the director and chief engineer of the bureau were resolved and passed. (3) The draft Provisional Organization Regulations of the Minsheng Canal Engineering Office and the request to appoint Wang Yangzeng as the director and engineer of the office were resolved and passed. (4) The draft Provisional Organization Regulations of the Central Cotton Improvement Institute and the general rules for the provisional organization of cotton production improvement institutes in various provinces were resolved and passed. (5) The list of members of the committee's Highway Committee was determined, and a request was made to designate the chairman and standing committee members, which was resolved and passed.

The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. (22nd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the Economic Committee, proposed to change the original Northwest Development Undertaking Implementation Plan of the committee. The original text stated: "I, Ziwen, previously believed that various undertakings of the committee in the Northwest were about to begin, so I personally went to the Northwest in April for an on-site inspection, lasting several weeks, passing through the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. After visiting the sites, I deeply understand that the Northwest undertakings that need to be developed and managed are extremely vast, and the local authorities and the public are particularly eager for the committee to develop and manage them. The undertaking implementation plan for the 23rd year previously determined by the committee can generally meet the current needs regarding various aspects of Northwest construction, but according to the actual situation, there are also places that should be changed. Now, after careful consideration, I propose to determine several methods for changing the scope of the original enterprise fee distribution within the scope of the distribution." (1) The water conservancy undertakings in Gansu and Ningxia provinces are very important. The undertaking implementation plan for this year of the committee was not included. Now it is planned to hold them separately. The estimated cost is about 500,000 yuan for Gansu Province and about 200,000 yuan for Ningxia Province, which, together with the original 1.3 million yuan for water conservancy in Shaanxi and Suiyuan provinces, totals 2 million yuan. To cover the increased 700,000 yuan, it is planned to transfer 100,000 yuan from the Northwest animal husbandry funds and 200,000 yuan from the Northwest cooperative funds, and the remainder will be raised separately. (2) It is planned to add 350,000 yuan to the Xi'an-Lanzhou highway construction funds, transferring 100,000 yuan from the funds originally planned to be borrowed for the Fujian road construction and 100,000 yuan from the highway transportation funds, leaving a shortage of 150,000 yuan, which will be addressed separately within the highway funds. (3) The 400,000 yuan for Northwest animal husbandry funds, after deducting 100,000 yuan as mentioned above, leaves 300,000 yuan, which will be merged into the original 300,000 yuan for Northwest animal epidemic prevention and health undertakings, totaling 600,000 yuan. The various items that should be handled for animal husbandry will be handled by the agriculturists and the Health Experiment Office in consultation. (4) The 400,000 yuan for Northwest rural cooperative funds, after deducting 200,000 yuan as mentioned above, leaves 200,000 yuan. Whether the above proposals are feasible, please decide.

<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Municipal Prosperity Committee proposed to the Chamber of Commerce that it should suggest to the government to implement the opening of prostitution, which is still under consideration. A report also stated that Nanjing will open prostitution. The municipal government stated that it was an outside speculation and stated that it is currently stepping up its work on the prostitution prohibition issue, planning a proper plan to gradually reduce it. During this period of strict enforcement of the New Life Movement, it will never make such contradictory moves due to the request of a few merchants. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e57">US Considering Extending Naval Conference for Five Years; World is Turbulent, Holding Meeting Next Year Will Be Fruitless; Hirota Prepares to Meet with British and American Ambassadors <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press obtained reliable news today that the extension of the naval disarmament conference scheduled to be held next year to 1940 is now under serious consideration. The world is now turbulent, especially the Far East. It will be difficult to achieve any success if a meeting is held next year. Some diplomatic and naval circles are discussing the proposal to extend the reduction of naval armaments for five years. Hopes were originally slim, but recent events have completely extinguished even the slightest of hope. According to London sources, Britain also intends to expand its navy, so the future of the conference is extremely pessimistic. Some quarters suggest that delaying the meeting is the best way to postpone the final decision on naval policy for various countries. Countries can find ways to achieve mutual political understanding before 1940. For precautionary reasons, the United States can also expand its navy to the limits allowed by the London Treaty. By the end of 1936, the United States will be only 85 warships short of the treaty limit. After the conference is postponed, the 5:5:3 ratio stipulated by the London Treaty should still be maintained, and the Japanese proposal to increase the ratio can also be avoided. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's policy for the naval disarmament conference next year is to participate on the premise that it is not restricted by the Washington and London treaties and that political issues are not discussed. However, it is recently rumored that British and American officials oppose Japan's demand to abolish the ratio agreement. If so, it will be difficult for Japan to implement its demands. Foreign Minister Hirota believes that if Britain and the United States deny Japan's demands on fundamental issues, the meeting next year may either break down or lead to Japan's withdrawal. Therefore, he is paying close attention to the true intentions of Britain and the United States. Depending on the situation, the Foreign Minister himself may personally hold preparatory meetings with the British and American ambassadors to explain Japan's demands, as the Foreign Minister has expressed his intention to take active action.

<h3 id="e58">Japan Opposes Postponement of Naval Conference; Hirota Reports Progress to Cabinet <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) There is now an opinion in the United States that since the next naval conference has no hope of success, there is no need to convene it and it would be better to postpone it. The US representatives in London also revealed the above informal opinion on the 21st. However, Ambassadors Saito in the United States and Matsudaira in the United Kingdom have not yet issued official telegrams to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding this situation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that there is no reason to postpone the meeting next year. For the sake of the smooth development of the next conference, it has already participated in the preparatory negotiations. Unexpectedly, such remarks have been made, which is unexpected. Moreover, today, when no concrete proposals have been discovered in the preparatory negotiations, it is unbelievable that an authoritative delegation is releasing an atmosphere that the formal meeting cannot be established. However, according to the current treaty, by 1935, Japan will be able to maintain a considerable ratio compared to the United Kingdom and the United States. However, by 1936, the proportion of old battleships and other circumstances will be lower than 60%. If we still follow the current treaty, it will naturally be difficult to succumb. Under this reality, the conference in 1935 must be convened, and it is a natural policy to demand the correction of the current ratio. (22nd Japan Federation Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Just as the London disarmament preparatory conference was beginning to show signs of progress, a section of the US political world, citing the chaotic political situation in the Far East, advocated postponing the disarmament conference until 1940. This opinion is quite noteworthy. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' intention regarding this is as follows: The reason why Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki signed at the London disarmament conference was that the London Treaty was a temporary agreement until 1936, which only had temporary effect. Moreover, the contracting countries are stipulated that they can participate in the disarmament conference in 1935 with a free position. Therefore, postponing the conference can be said to be a violation of the spirit of the Washington and London treaties. The reason for the US's hope to postpone it is that by 1940, the warship construction plan will be fully completed, and it will possess the actual power of the world's number one and will use this to suppress the demands of the UK, Japan, etc. However, this self-centered attitude is detrimental to the success of the conference and the preservation of peace in the Far East. It lies in the fact that the UK and the US recognize the political self in the Far East, and that it can be separated from the naval issue. Although the disarmament conference is postponed, if the US adopts an attitude of putting Japan's Far East issue on the scale with disarmament, it is feared that it will be difficult for the agreement to be established. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not pay attention to the postponement of the disarmament conference. At the same time, the Navy also believes that this is a self-serving argument and dismisses it with a laugh. (22nd Telecommunication Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's routine cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 AM. Prime Minister Saito and other cabinet members attended. Foreign Minister Hirota reported the progress of the disarmament preparatory negotiations as follows: (1) The United Kingdom hopes to hold the meeting before the Emperor's celebration ceremony, advocating holding the meeting within January. The United States hopes to hold it in the summer due to parliamentary relations. Japan advocates holding it in April, so the date has not yet been decided. (2) The United Kingdom and the United States do not seem to oppose Japan's demand not to discuss the Far East issue. (3) As for the location of the meeting, the United Kingdom and the United States each advocate holding it in their own capitals, so it has not been decided. (4) As for the countries participating in the negotiations, Japan advocates the participation of the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, France, and Italy. However, due to European relations, the participation of Germany, Russia, and Spain may be a problem. (22nd Telecommunication Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) As far as is generally known, in this morning's meeting between British and American naval experts, the British representatives submitted a list to the American representatives of the minimum number of warships and equipment required for British national defense, and explained the various technical and military reasons. The American delegation will send this document to the Navy Department in Washington, and further negotiations will continue after the government expresses its opinion. The United States has not submitted a document of the same nature, and is still adopting a wait-and-see attitude. So far, it has only filed the outline explained by the British representatives regarding British naval policy. The document submitted by the British experts this morning is temporary in nature, and its contents can be referred to and revised with reference to the naval policies of other countries. It is said that the British naval organization will undergo changes after the expiry of the Washington and London naval treaties. Whether the two naval treaties will be extended or revised after their expiry is the purpose of the 1935 naval conference. (21st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the report of Ambassador Matsudaira stationed in the United Kingdom, the British policy for the naval conference preparatory negotiations is not to decide on procedures in a hurry, but to freely exchange opinions with Japan and the United States, and resolve them after Prime Minister MacDonald consults with the representatives of the two countries at an appropriate time. Therefore, the venue and time of the formal meeting, the topics of discussion, etc., can be decided after France and Italy participate. (22nd Japan Federation Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Il Lavoro, the organ of the Fascist Party, commented on the 1935 naval conference, saying that if Germany and Russia participate at the same time as the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, and become a seven-nation conference, it will have great political value. Such a conference may appear on the surface to be holding technical negotiations, but in reality, it is seeking compromises among countries in order to achieve a balance of power with each other.

<h3 id="e60">Britain Advocates Expanding Navy <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(London) Among the British newspapers, the Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, publishes the most news about the preparatory negotiations for the 1935 naval conference. The reason is that the Conservative Party has repeatedly stated that the current state of the British Navy is dangerous, and the government will inevitably use the opportunity of this preparatory negotiation to satisfy the Conservative Party. The Labour Party's organ is well aware of this. Its claim is that on the one hand, it wants to reduce land armaments, and on the other hand, it should not reorganize sea armaments. However, the policy adopted by the British government for the next naval conference is not a policy of reducing armaments, but a policy of large-scale reorganization of armaments. The contents of the document submitted by Naval Minister Monsell to the American experts at the meeting of British and American experts yesterday morning are astonishing. The document stated that, from a technical perspective of imperial national defense and the security of imperial trade routes, the United Kingdom must require the following: (1) After the expiration of the Washington Naval Treaty, the United Kingdom should build a new main fleet. (2) Build 30 new cruisers to increase the number of cruisers to 70, because 10 of the original 50 cruisers will be old and unusable in two years, so they can only be used as 40. (3) Build many destroyers. (4) Build many aircraft carriers. The Daily Herald therefore believes that the 1927 naval conference failed due to British policy, and now Britain has returned to its policy at that time. In short, this request by the United Kingdom will inevitably cause an unpleasant reaction from the United States, because even if the United States allows the United Kingdom's request, the Japanese Navy will inevitably demand the same increase, which the United States cannot allow. The Daily Herald editorial also stated that those who advocate a strong naval policy have repeatedly forced the government to follow their claims and repeatedly urged continental countries to reduce or limit their naval armaments. However, is it not strange that what our government opposes is only the reorganization of armaments on land, while it is resolutely proceeding with the reorganization of armaments at sea?

<p>(Moscow) A decree from the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union orders the abolition of the core staff of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Soviet Union and the People's Commissariat of the Army and Navy.

<p>(Moscow) An editorial in the Soviet government gazette, Izvestia, states: "The renaming of the Army and Navy Commissariat as the Defense Commissariat is intended to emphasize the fact that the purpose of the entire Soviet military system is defense, with absolutely no intention of aggression, attack, or military expansion. The Soviet Army and Navy, by their very nature, cannot be used as weapons of aggression. The renaming of the Army Commissariat itself further reinforces this concept." The newspaper continues, "The Soviet government is implementing its clear and concrete peace plan in all aspects and along all avenues of its activities. This peace policy is not a chance detour but the essence of proletarian diplomacy. Currently, the Soviet government is relying on its diplomatic organs to pursue it bravely and resolutely. At the same time, this policy is supported by the working masses of both the Soviet Union and capitalist countries, and the Soviet Army and Navy (defenders of peace and their socialist homeland) are developing and strengthening under this banner of peace."

<h3 id="e63">Further Discussion on Rescuing the Fishing Industry <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Fang</p>
<p>The importance of the fishing industry is now universally recognized. This newspaper recently discussed the lack of vitality in our country's fishing industry and the ways to rescue it. Feeling that the ideas were not fully expressed, I present them again to serve as a supplement.</p>
<p>In recent times, the hardship of our country's aquatic products industry has reached its extreme. Speaking of fishing, there are pirates and the encroachment of strong neighbors, and fishing villages are showing signs of bankruptcy. Speaking of sales, fish prices are low, the market is chaotic, and fishermen lack financial regulation. If this continues, the complete collapse of the fishing industry is inevitable. Although there are thousands of reasons for this, the root cause lies in three external factors:</p>
<p>First, the knowledge of those engaged in fishing is limited and outdated. Fishermen cannot explore distant fishing grounds and only know how to compete for catches in coastal areas. Although they know that catches are decreasing year by year, they remain passive and unchanging. Fish merchants always concentrate the distribution of fish products in one place and do not know how to distribute products to different locations. They are also trapped by the exploitation of fish markets. Although fish prices plummet and profits are meager, fish products are still imported as usual. Fish markets do not improve their routine systems at all and only seek their own immediate interests, without considering the interests of fishermen and merchants. They do not know that the relationship between fishermen, fish merchants, and fish markets is very close, like lips and teeth. If fishermen and fish merchants are eliminated, how can the fish markets survive alone?</p>
<p>The second is the dumping of imported aquatic products. Since China opened its ports, aquatic product trade has always been in deficit. In recent years, various countries have developed their aquatic product industries, and facing domestic economic panic, they all seek an outlet, regarding China's market as their dumping ground. Japan is particularly prominent in this regard, with annual leakages reaching tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Third, the encroachment of Japanese fishing vessels. In recent years, Japan has actively developed its deep-sea fishing industry and has even greater ambitions for maritime rights in our country. Therefore, our country's coast is full of Japanese fishing boats that indiscriminately fish. The fish they catch are sold at reduced prices in various ports along our coast to sell them quickly and continue fishing. As a result, the fish that our fishermen work hard to catch must also be sold at low prices. The impact is such that many cannot maintain their livelihoods. It is no wonder that our country's aquatic products industry has been declining year by year.</p>
<p>All three of these factors are the driving forces behind the collapse of our country's fishing industry. If we want to urgently seek rescue, we must pay attention to the following strategies:</p>
<p>First, we must urgently stabilize fishing villages. Fishing villages are the foundation of the fishing industry. If fishing villages are safe, fishermen can live and work in peace. If fishermen live and work in peace, they can calmly plan the development of the fishing industry. Today, the bankruptcy of fishing villages and the rampant piracy are mutually reinforcing. The arrival of pirates is due to the decreasing fish production and the difficulty of fishermen's livelihoods, as well as the exploitation by local bullies and the extortion by government officials. Fishermen are under heavy pressure and cannot bear the suffering. The strong often become bandits. Once they become pirates, they turn to disturb the people. This cycle continues endlessly, which is why fishing villages are not peaceful. The way to stabilize fishing villages lies in maintaining law and order and guiding fishing. The implementation can start by delineating fishing areas and sending people who are familiar with maritime conditions and have aquatic knowledge to be responsible for guidance. If the whole country can advance simultaneously, the results will be faster. Second, we must improve fishing organizations. Those engaged in fishing in our country have a strong sense of association and form groups with feudal characteristics, such as the Fishermen's Guilds in the outer seas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. However, their work is only to resolve disputes among fishermen and request police protection in the name of the guild. In addition, they are indifferent to how to improve their own business, how to cooperate in production and sales, and how to prevent theft. The common facilities that modern social organizations should have are also lacking. Our country's Fishermen's Association Law has long been promulgated, but there are only three formal fishermen's associations in Shandong, fourteen in Jiangsu, six in Zhejiang, three in Fujian, and two in Anhui. The number is extremely limited. Even the work they advocate has not been fully realized. Therefore, fishermen in the outer seas still gather and disperse irregularly and cannot benefit from the organization. This is also something that needs to be improved urgently. Third, we must rationally distribute products. Our country's fish products are only concentrated in one place. Although the output has fallen drastically, the concentrated areas still feel that the supply exceeds demand, which leads to a drop in fish prices that cannot be reversed. The Ministry of Industry is actively preparing to establish a Shanghai fish market. It is said that the progress has reached a considerable level. Construction plans and organizational regulations are gradually taking shape, and it can officially open next spring. After this matter is realized, the distribution of fish products can be appropriately allocated according to the needs of various places. The Ministry of Railways is also working hard to add refrigerated vehicles. From now on, coastal fish products can be sold smoothly in the interior. With the expansion of sales channels, fish prices will naturally rise, and the lives of fishermen can also be slightly improved. However, these two things must be done carefully at the beginning, otherwise, they will only lose the trust of fishermen and fish merchants and will not help the actual situation.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must facilitate the circulation of aquatic product finance. Because our country's fish products are concentrated in one place, aquatic product finance is also controlled by the fish markets in one place. Fishermen's economic capital is mostly borrowed from fish markets, and there are various restrictions. Therefore, the establishment of a fishery bank is an urgent task. In the future, loan procedures can be handled by local fishermen's associations to make it easier to popularize among fishermen.</p>
<p>Fifth, we must popularize fishermen's education. Although our country's aquatic education has been carried out for a long time, it lacks the support of society and the promotion of the government. Moreover, the teaching staff often cannot provide students with knowledge that is relevant to the national conditions and profound academic knowledge. Generally, students lack the perseverance to be strong when they are in school, and after leaving school, they are ambitious and unwilling to work in the field. This is why the fishery education that has been promoted for more than 20 years has not achieved any success. Therefore, today, when we talk about aquatic education, we should change our original intentions. Mr. Niu Yongjian has strongly advocated fishermen's education. The public education center established in Songjiang County also has fishermen's education facilities. In the community education meeting of the sixth district of Jiangsu Province the day before yesterday, a proposal to pay attention to fishermen's education was also passed. This can be a model for various provinces and cities.</p>
<p>Sixth, we must revise the import tariff rates for aquatic products. Our country's fishing industry has been seriously harmed by the dumping of imported aquatic products. If we can give appropriate restrictions to imported goods, we can give the domestic products a chance to recover. However, before revising the tariff rules, we must have a deep understanding of the various imported goods before making a decision. Otherwise, if the tax rate is increased too much for those with fewer imports, and those who harm domestic products are not restricted, then it cannot be said to be a fair treatment.</p>
<p>In addition, the investigation of the national fishing industry, the promotion of fishing administration, and the prevention of Japanese fishing vessels from fishing have been discussed in detail in the previous commentary. I hope that those in power will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Britain Intensifies Research on Aerial Tactics: Forms Special Unit for Special Training, New Single-Seat Aircraft to Be Publicly Exhibited <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(London) It is reported that the British Air Force is now organizing a special unit to study aerial tactics, with pilots who were aerial combatants during the European War as assistants. Because the types of aircraft have greatly increased now, and after the failure of the Disarmament Conference, Britain will add several new air forces, special training is necessary. What will be tested to the best of its ability is the relative advantages and disadvantages of single-seat aircraft and two-seat aircraft. Single-seat aircraft fly faster and ascend more easily when soaring, but two-seat aircraft have stronger manpower and can combine bombing and combat. This special team will also study new tactics and new formations, and the possibility of placing more guns on aircraft, and the comparative advantages of biplanes. Three new single-seat aircraft secretly manufactured by the British Air Force will be displayed for the first time at the British Aircraft Exhibition on June 30. This new type of aircraft is powered by an air-cooled engine and has no water radiator. The weight of the fuselage is greatly reduced and it is not easily attacked by the enemy. The size of its speed is not yet known, but it is known that the red, white, and blue colors of the tail are no longer used because more paint will increase the weight of the aircraft. All protruding objects that may hinder the speed of the aircraft have been removed. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Chilean Capital According to news received here today, Bolivia and Paraguay have been fighting fiercely in the past week. Both sides admit that there are fierce battles, and it is expected that this will be a move to determine the final victory or defeat in the Gran Chaco War. The total number of soldiers on both sides is 50,000. The armies of both countries are not large, so 50,000 people can be said to be a very large force. According to Bolivian intelligence, the Paraguayan army has been fiercely attacking along a 20-mile-long front in the past week, and fierce battles are still ongoing. People here expect that if the Paraguayan army can break through the front line it is attacking, the Bolivian army will collapse. However, the Bolivian government said that the Bolivian front line has been attacked many times and is still firmly holding its position. The Paraguay-Bolivia war has been going on for two years, and the League of Nations and neighboring countries have mediated many times, but the war has not stopped. Although 34 countries have agreed to the principle of stopping the supply of arms, this ban has not yet been implemented. It is estimated that 28,000 people died and 52,000 were injured in the first year of the war. The number of deaths and injuries in the second year is unknown, but it must be less than in the first year. Both countries use various modern weapons, which they purchased from foreign countries at this time.</p>

Another telegram said that Romanian Prime Minister Tătărescu stated that Romania was France's rearguard. Evening newspapers reported that the Little Entente had drafted two agreements and submitted them to French Foreign Minister Barthou. The first agreement advocates expanding the current Balkan Pact into an Eastern Locarno Pact, and the second agreement hopes to conclude a Mediterranean Pact including Soviet Russia and Italy. The French side seems to approve of this proposal and also proposes that Germany join the first pact and Italy join the second pact. A certain Tongjiu News Agency claimed that Barthou and Titulescu, representing France and the Little Entente, had reached an agreement with the following content: (1) Strictly abide by the Locarno Pact; (2) Conclude a Baltic Pact; (3) Conclude an Eastern Locarno Pact, including the Balkan countries, Soviet Russia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Germany; (4) Conclude a Mediterranean Pact, including Soviet Russia, the Little Entente countries, Bulgaria, Turkey, Italy, and France, with Italy and Poland as the main obstacles.

Barthou was accompanied by Prime Minister Tătărescu and Foreign Minister Titulescu to the meeting place. All members and listeners stood up and saluted, cheering loudly and continuously for a long time. There has never been such a grand occasion in the Romanian Parliament. The Speaker of the House of Representatives delivered a welcome speech, praising the close friendship and spirit of cooperation between France and Romania. Foreign Minister Titulescu then rose to speak, first stating that France and Romania are brothers in spirit and can therefore form an unbreakable alliance. He then stated that the Romanian border cannot be changed and formally declared, "If anyone asks Romania to cede an inch of land, the reply of the Romanian people must be 'No, no, never'." Titulescu also said that Romania has special feelings for France, so the political actions of the two countries are easy to agree on. Titulescu then paid tribute to Barthou in the name of the Romanian government and people. Then, the whole venue cheered for France and Barthou, and finally the leaders of various parties paid tribute to Barthou in the name of their respective parties. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital The grand occasion of the Senate and the House of Representatives welcoming French Foreign Minister Barthou has been recorded in the previous telegram. After Foreign Minister Titulescu delivered his speech and the leaders of various political parties paid their respects, Prime Minister Tătărescu proposed that the assembly declare Barthou an "Honorary Citizen of Romania." The whole venue cheered and unanimously agreed. Prime Minister Tătărescu's speech was eloquent and moving. Finally, he said to Barthou, "The Romanian Parliament gives you a second homeland, a gift of emotion, which is given by the Romanian people. The Romanian people will not forget the past, neglect the present, and fear the future. I hope you will accept this gift with a smile. I represent Romania and wish France all the best." At this point, the whole venue stood up, Barthou approached Tătărescu, hugged each other, and kissed each other. Everyone applauded and cheered. Barthou thanked him with impromptu words, which were very moving, saying that his emotion today was unprecedented. He had been in politics for 45 years, and this was the first time. He then described his meeting with the King, saying that the King was the first person in Romania, and in his opinion, the King was one of the most loyal to the French-Romanian alliance. He then said, "I am here to convey the French mission. Now, I am recognized as a Romanian citizen, and tomorrow I will return to France as the Romanian Ambassador." Barthou finally said, "The peace treaty returns Romania's original boundaries to the original owner, and Romania will forever own them and will not allow others to seize them."

However, Prime Minister Hitler's mission was to report the Venice talks to President Hindenburg, and there may not be any other considerations. As for the unease in the political circles caused by Deputy Prime Minister von Papen's speech, it has now been calmed down.

His speech was banned by the government and was never published. Recently, "Le Petit Parisien" obtained the main points of von Papen's speech and published them in the newspaper. Von Papen briefly said, "The task of the newspaper is to report the government's political mistakes, weaknesses, incompetence, and malpractices so that it can improve. This cannot be replaced by anonymous exposure and secret work organs. If this is used to measure it, then the German newspaper has lost its reason for existence. Who is without fault? The important thing is to listen to advice. Only the weak are unwilling to be criticized. One-party dictatorship is only a transitional political system. It should be abolished when the people can freely choose. I have never seen a country whose people can be clearly divided into two classes, one enjoying full rights and the other having their rights reduced. Perhaps only the system of Sparta is like this. Sparta divided the people into citizens and slaves, but the demise of Sparta was due to this. Is the German phenomenon going to restore the maladministration of Sparta? No amount of propaganda or organization can maintain the people's faith for a long time. For those who do not understand the authorities and criticize them, we can only humbly explain and persuade them, and should not incite young people to hate or threaten innocent people. Those who convince people with sincerity can make the people make considerable sacrifices for the country. If the people's mouths are silenced, the government's credibility will be lost." After publishing the summary, "Le Petit Parisien" said that the content of von Papen's speech was like this, which shows that the German government has different opinions on major issues, and it is no wonder that the German government hurriedly banned its publication.

<p>(Washington) According to the customs export statistics released today, Japan purchased the most arms in March, followed by China. Japan's purchase of US arms in only one month of March has reached a huge amount of US$7,999,258. The third customer for US arms is Bolivia, which is fighting a deadly battle with Paraguay. In March, Bolivia purchased arms worth US$310,165. After Congress passed the bill to block arms to the two countries of Bolivia and Paraguay, Bolivia has not been able to purchase in the United States again. Paraguay stopped purchasing US arms before the embargo took effect. (National News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Debt Issue: Germany Cannot Be Subdued by Threats, Willing to Sever Commercial Relations with Countries that Force a Clearing System, President of German Bank Publicly Expresses Demand to Recover Old Colonies <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) President Schacht of the Deutsche Bank hosted a tea party today to entertain diplomats and foreign newspaper representatives, stating that Germany intends to sever commercial relations with countries that force a clearing system on Germany. Schacht said that Germany's debt problem cannot be solved by power or coercion. The clearing system is equivalent to not paying for goods. This will reduce Germany's international trade to a very low level, eventually leading to a complete halt to international commercial relations. No one can believe that Germany will calmly endure it. If Great Britain establishes a clearing system, it will definitely greatly damage the trade between British territories and Germany. This is undoubtedly true. Schacht then proposed three ways to remedy the current difficult situation: (1) Return Germany's former colonies so that Germany can purchase raw materials with its own currency; (2) Give Germany more opportunities to increase its exports so that it can repay its debts; (3) Reduce the principal and interest of Germany's debts. Schacht also firmly stated that Germany's currency will never inflate. The German government is determined to maintain the stability of the mark, so the collapse of the German currency is definitely not a problem. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The British government today asked Germany to send representatives to London to discuss the debt agreement in order to avoid establishing a clearing system or discussing methods to ensure that this type of clearing system has absolutely no effect on trade between Britain and Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain submitted a draft law to the House of Commons yesterday, requesting authorization from the government to establish a clearing house and restrict imports from certain countries in order to force the recovery of the debts owed to Britain by those countries. After the proposal of this bill, it did not arouse enthusiastic sympathy in political circles. Its newspaper even gave it quite fierce criticism. Among those who favored the bill the most, they also said that some of the disadvantages were necessary and some were not. This case is an unnecessary disadvantage. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e73">U.S. Treasury Department Begins Buying Silver, Gradually Purchasing with Funds to Stabilize Silver Prices <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced today that the purchase of silver will be in accordance with the Congressional bill. Rumors of the government ceasing silver purchases have thus been dispelled. The Secretary stated, "We desire a healthy rise in silver prices, but we do not want the unstable fluctuations caused by market speculation as seen last summer. Once silver prices rise, we must stabilize them." Morgenthau further announced that the Treasury Department's silver purchasing plan has already commenced, with substantial amounts of silver being bought in New York and London. The funds used for purchasing silver come from the Treasury's exchange stabilization fund. Purchases began before the President signed the silver bill last Tuesday and are still ongoing. The Secretary declined to announce the amount of silver the government has purchased, but unofficial sources estimate it to be about 65 million ounces. The Secretary said that future purchases will depend entirely on the silver market; purchases will be made when prices are suitable. After the Secretary announced this news, silver advocates in Washington expressed strong support. Consequently, those who doubted that the government would actually implement silver purchases under permissible laws are now satisfied. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) The Treasury Department announced today that silver certificates issued for the purchase of silver will be based on the purchase price of the silver. This method will be used at least for the present. For example, if one million ounces of silver are purchased for $650,000, then $650,000 in silver certificates will be issued. Whether the Treasury Department will utilize the flexible provisions of the Silver Act to issue silver certificates at the inflated price of $1.29 per ounce is a policy issue to be determined in the future.</p>
<p>It is reported that the newly purchased silver will be used immediately to issue new silver certificates. However, the Treasury Department believes that this will not increase the currency in circulation but will instead use the silver certificates to withdraw an equivalent amount of Federal Reserve notes. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) According to an official announcement today, 10,570,713 ounces of silver were withdrawn from the New York Commodities Exchange vault on Tuesday and Wednesday. The current vault balance is 92,136,662 ounces. According to well-informed financial sources, this silver has been transferred to the government vault, which is part of the Treasury Department's large-scale silver purchases in New York. Of the 1.45 million ounces of silver traded on the Commodities Exchange yesterday, approximately half was purchased by the Treasury Department. (21st National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau today instructed all directors of the Treasury Department, stating that they must choose between severing ties with politics or leaving the Treasury Department. The Secretary's directive stated that all Treasury Department employees are henceforth prohibited from holding any political party positions; otherwise, they should immediately leave the Treasury Department. This is to be implemented by September 1st. This action by the Secretary aligns with President Roosevelt's speech at Yale University on Thursday, in which he stated that the Federal Government should appoint personnel based on talent, regardless of political affiliation.

Regarding the traffic plan, after Yin Tong telegraphed the Ministry of Railways for instructions, it was decided that on the morning of the 28th at 9:00 AM, the timetable would be limited simultaneously in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and the Japanese side would publish it at the embassy. The name of our publishing agency has not yet been determined. After the plan is announced, implementation can begin, and the July 1st deadline will not be delayed again. Yin Tong will also issue a declaration when the plan is announced to explain the traffic matters. In addition, detailed implementation measures have been carefully formulated by the Beining Railway Bureau and compiled into a book. It will be announced at the same time as the plan is announced. Tracing back to the traffic issue, since Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, took office last winter, he drafted a plan in November due to the urging of the Japanese side. In May of this year, the urging from the Japanese side became more urgent, resulting in the Yuguan meeting on May 14th. However, that meeting only made preliminary exchanges of opinions on the traffic plan that had been drafted in the past. After the Yuguan meeting, Yin Tong took the results of the exchanges of opinions to Beijing and Shanghai for instructions. Then, Yin personally went to Dalian on the 13th of this month to negotiate in detail with Japanese embassy military attaché Shibayama and Manchukuo Railway representative Kougong, etc., and separately formulated detailed implementation rules, which were extremely detailed. They have recently been printed and bound into a book of over 200 pages. After both parties agreed, Yin returned to Tianjin on the 16th and convened responsible personnel from the accounting, transportation, and mechanical departments of the Beining Railway Bureau to re-discuss technical matters. They unanimously decided that only the issue of organizing the main agency remained to be discussed. Yin decided to invite relevant Chinese and Japanese personnel to Tianjin within this week for final discussions. The Chinese participants in this meeting will be representatives from the Ministry of Railways, Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, and the heads of various departments, and representatives from the China Travel Service. The Japanese participants will be representatives from the Kwantung Army, representatives from the Manchukuo Railway, and Suzuki, the Director of the International Tourist Bureau, and Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy. Chen Xiangtao, the president of the China Travel Service, has been invited by Yin to come north. Prior to the Yuguan meeting, when the Japanese side initially raised the request for traffic, the Beijing side once sought Chen's consent regarding the main traffic matters. Therefore, Chen will also be summoned to come north for negotiations. Suzuki, the Director of the International Tourist Bureau of the Japanese side, etc., will arrive in Tianjin from Shenyang within days. The date for the implementation of traffic will be determined after the Tianjin meeting closes.</p>
<p>According to Yin Tong, "When I left Shanghai by ship for Dalian, Chairman Huang (Fu)'s nose disease had recovered. Because there are still matters to be discussed with the Central Government, the date of his trip north is uncertain. The traffic matter still needs to be discussed in Tianjin. When it will be implemented can only be determined after the discussions. At the same time, I will issue a statement in my personal capacity, detailing the process of handling traffic matters. The issue of the number of newly formed security teams in the war zone was agreed upon with the Japanese side when the Tanggu Truce Agreement was signed. It was agreed to train 9,000 people to enter the war zone. I participated in the meeting at the time and know it more accurately. Perhaps I can negotiate with the Japanese side again, and there will be no problem. As for the establishment of customs offices at various passes of the Great Wall, the Ministry of Finance is responsible for planning and resolving it. Because it is not my responsibility, I do not know the detailed measures." According to Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Shibayama, "The implementation of traffic is not far off. All issues in the war zone can be resolved gradually after the implementation of traffic. I will go to Tianjin in the next few days to negotiate with relevant parties (referring to the Japanese side)." (21st)</p>

<p>The Six-County Suppression Headquarters Concludes</p>
<p>Anqing Dispatch, Wang Xijun, Deputy Director of the Anhui Provincial Security Department and Commander-in-Chief of the Temporary Suppression of Bandits in Six Counties on the Border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces, was ordered in March of this year to go to Guangde on the Anhui border to organize the headquarters and supervise the suppression of bandits in various counties. The headquarters' suppression work has now been largely completed. The accumulated bandits Luo Gongming (i.e., Luo Tuozi), Ren Chunsheng (i.e., Ren Laowu), Zhang Dayin, etc., have all been captured and executed one after another. Other scattered mountain bandits have also been gradually eliminated. Now that the bandits have been suppressed, Wang has requested the provincial government to end the headquarters on the 15th of this month, as post-suppression work involves rural reconstruction and only the use of political power to restore local order and cultivate the self-governance of the people, which should be earnestly handled by the county chiefs. He has also led all officers back to the province and returned to work at the department. (June 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e101">Tianjin: Two Incidents in One Day; Head of Health Section of Beining Railway Bureau Assassinated; Three Bookstores Including Dacheng Bookstore Smashed <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Two unusual events occurred here today (19th). One was the assassination of Kang Mingzhen, the head of the health section of the Beining Railway Bureau, who was killed while passing through Asahi Street in the Japanese Concession. The other was that Hui people, believing that the sale of the book "Nian Gengyao Pacifying the West" by three bookstores including Dacheng Bookstore insulted their religion, gathered a crowd to smash the stores. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Kang Mingzhen, the head of the health section of the Beining Railway Bureau, was 39 years old, a native of Haicheng, Liaoning. He graduated from the South Manchuria Railway Medical College and served as a physician at Qingdao Hospital and chief of the general affairs section of the Huludao Port Authority of the Beining Railway. After the September 18th Incident, he came to Tianjin. When the League of Nations Investigation Commission came to China, Kang served as the head of the Beidaihe Public Security Bureau. This spring, he was appointed as the head of the health section of the Beining Railway Bureau. His residence was at No. 5 Anding Lane, Guangdong Road, British Concession, Tianjin. Previously, Kang worked at the bureau and commuted to and from work by company car. After taking the position in the health section, it was inconvenient to commute by company car because his office was located on Xinda Road, Hebei, so he switched to rickshaws. This morning (19th) at 8:30, Kang took a rickshaw from his home to the office in Hebei, passing through Asahi Street in the Japanese Concession. At this time, a young thug, dressed as a worker, followed him on a bicycle. Kang did not notice that he was being followed because the street was a thoroughfare with many people coming and going. When he reached the front of the New Inn, the thug suddenly pulled out a pistol and aimed it at the back of Kang's head, firing once. The bullet entered through the upper part of the back of the head, exiting diagonally from the forehead without completely penetrating. Kang immediately bled profusely and fainted in the rickshaw. The thug immediately turned around and fled towards Rong Street. The rickshaw driver noticed something was wrong, looked back, but had already lost sight of the thug. He urgently summoned the police to send Kang to the Zhonghe Hospital for treatment. Due to excessive injuries, he died at around 11:00 AM. This afternoon, Nagao, the chief of the Japanese Concession Police Department, inspected the body at the hospital and told the family that he would do his best to search for the perpetrator. In the evening, the French Concession police arrested a young man at the Yuanxing Inn on Zhangzhuang Bridge, who was found to be in possession of a pistol. It is said that he is the perpetrator of this case, but the man does not admit it. Kang is survived by a wife and a concubine, and six children. His eldest son is 17 years old and studying in Beiping. He returned for the funeral tonight. His wife and one child each live in Haicheng, Liaoning. Only his concubine and three sons and one daughter live in Tianjin. It is reported that the reason for Kang's death is that Kang was an old member of the Kuomintang and still held a position in the Northeast Party Affairs Working Group in Beiping. He was required to go there once every Tuesday. Today happened to be Tuesday, and it is unknown why he did not go, but was assassinated. The authorities suspect a political background.</p>
<p>Dacheng Bookstore, located on Dahutong Street in Tianjin, is a branch of the Dacheng Bookstore in Shanghai. Recently, it has been selling the book "Nian Gengyao Pacifying the West," which has been selling very well. The content of the book describes how Hui people were treated when General Nian pacified the West. Hui people here believe that this insults their religion. Several days ago, some people secretly gathered and sent four or five people to Dacheng Bookstore disguised as customers, wanting to purchase 100 copies. The bookstore at that time boasted about the value of the book, with many false and incomplete claims, especially angering the people who came. At that time, there was no quarrel, and they paid and placed an order. Today at 8:30 PM, representatives from more than 20 mosques in Tianjin gathered in front of the bookstore on Dahutong Street and broke into the store, completely smashing the bookshelves upstairs and downstairs. The bookstore employees and staff all fled. One of them, Xu Liwu, was unable to escape and was beaten. Just as officers and police from the Third Precinct of the First District arrived to mediate, six Hui people including Liu Wenzhi came forward, willing to go to court, and were taken away by the police. The Hui people's remaining anger did not subside, and they went to Zhili Bookstore and Weiwen Bookstore on Beima Road, entering and carrying out the same smashing. One clerk from each of the two bookstores was injured. At this time, the provincial government and the Public Security Bureau heard the news and urgently sent personnel to stop them. Respected members of the Hui community also rushed to mediate, and the crowd dispersed. In the evening, the three bookstores each assessed the losses, which were considerable. Photos were taken and sent to various associations to appeal for assistance. Although the facts were as clear as day, the newspapers reporting on this event tonight all took a cautious attitude and were unwilling to publish the facts truthfully (19th).</p>
<h3 id="e102">Cantonese Merchants Oppose the Connection of the Guangzhou-Hankou and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railways; The Origin of the Re-emergence of the Issue of Railway Connection; Merchants from All Sectors Believe It is Harmful and Yields No Benefits <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: In order to complete its plan as the only port in South China, the Hong Kong government has long wanted to persuade the Guangdong government to connect the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway with the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway. The British have a broad vision, believing that when the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway is completed in the future, it will be the central route of China, connecting Pingjin in the north and reaching the Pearl River in the south. North-South commerce will rely on the transportation of this route and become more developed. In the future, the southern terminus of this route will be in Guangzhou, and its prosperity will be many times greater than it is today. Hong Kong is blocked by Guangzhou's hinterland. It is expected that Hong Kong's commerce with North China will be monopolized by Guangzhou. Therefore, the Hong Kong government proposed the connection of the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangzhou-Hankou Railways around 1923 and tried to persuade the Guangdong government to agree. Later, Chen Jiongming took charge of Guangdong's administration and Chen Xiru served as the provincial governor. Chen was a wealthy merchant in Hong Kong and belonged to the comprador class. He believed that the railway connection would benefit Hong Kong's commerce and forgot about the interests of Guangzhou's hinterland. There was an intention to negotiate, and a preliminary agreement for the railway connection was drafted. Unexpectedly, as soon as this proposal was announced, it was opposed by Cantonese merchants and groups from all walks of life, who strongly stated that the railway connection would cause hundreds of harms and no benefits to Guangdong Province. On the contrary, if this matter were to succeed, Hong Kong would become the southern terminus of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, and Guangzhou would become a wasteland. After fierce opposition from all walks of life, the Guangdong government, fearing public opinion, stopped the matter. People in Hong Kong and China, unable to achieve their goal, later changed their approach and persuaded the Guangdong side to lay tracks on Dexuan Road, so that the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangzhou-Hankou Railways could be connected invisibly. The Cantonese people saw through the inside story and strongly opposed it, and this proposal was shelved again. Until recently, Hong Kong has been affected by the global economic downturn, and Hong Kong's commerce has plummeted. At the beginning of the month, when the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce held its annual meeting, Chairman Huang Guangtian presented ten items in a plan to revitalize Hong Kong's commerce. The fourth item of the plan was to propose the connection of the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangzhou-Hankou Railways, believing that this move would greatly help revitalize Hong Kong's commerce. He also explained that according to the current Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, the British section first saw a profit in 1930, with a profit of 138,767 yuan that year. This year it has increased to more than 711,000 yuan. The Chinese section loses 6,000 yuan per kilometer every year. The total track length is 140 kilometers, resulting in a total loss of 864,000 yuan per year. If the Guangzhou-Hankou and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railways are connected, the commercial benefits would be enormous, and the government could take the construction costs of the railway connection from the Boxer Indemnity, and so on. Since this matter was raised again, it has attracted the attention of the Cantonese people. On the 11th of this month, the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a meeting to discuss this matter. Everyone believed that this matter was of great importance and that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should solicit the opinions of the merchants and people of the entire city, submit them to the government, and ask for attention. Afterwards, the Guangzhou City Long-Distance Bus Association, the Rubber Industry Association, the Match Industry, the Piece Goods Industry, the Yarn Industry, the Hospitality Industry, and the Paper Industry Associations all believed that it was absolutely harmful and yielded no benefits, and strongly opposed it. Before long, merchants from the Leather Industry, Sauce and Condiment Industry, Tea House Industry, Western Medicine Industry, Silver Industry, Banking Industry, Fish Market, and North-South Trade Brokerage also continued to oppose it. Therefore, the proposal of Chairman Huang Guangtian of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to connect the railways can be said to be completely met with absolute opposition from the Cantonese merchants. If the government can comply with the request of the Cantonese people, this matter will be difficult to realize. In addition, Li Pan, the Director of the Guangzhou-Hankou (now renamed Guangzhou-Shaoguan) Railway Bureau, briefly expressed that the rumors of borrowing money from Britain with the connection of the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangzhou-Hankou Railways as a condition were completely unfounded. Xiao Focheng, a member of the Political Affairs Committee, also declared that he did not approve of the railway connection and that the government had no intention of accommodating the railway connection.

<p>At No. 126 Baoqing Street, Dongmennei of this city, a tenant surnamed Gu, nearly seventy years old, with impaired hearing and vision, usually cooked for himself and had no accidents. Unexpectedly, yesterday at noon, the kitchen of this man suddenly caught fire due to carelessness, and in an instant, flames burst through the roof. Since the man was unable to extinguish the fire, he rushed out and jumped out of the upstairs window, his head and face burned, barely alive. Fortunately, firefighters from various districts arrived at the scene one after another to put out the fire, and it was quickly extinguished, preventing it from spreading to neighboring houses. The injured Mr. Gu was sent to the public hospital for treatment by police car. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died at 3:00 PM.</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang, in order to reorganize the Civil Defense Corps of Jiangsu and Jiangxi provinces, specially appointed Luo Yi, Hou Zhiqin, Wang Shihai and three others as Jiangsu-Jiangxi District Civil Defense Corps Inspection Commissioners. This county government received a telegram from the Provincial Security Office yesterday (22nd), stating that the three commissioners had already departed from Jiangxi on the 17th to Suzhou, and would arrive in Wuxian in about a week.

<p>Due to the recent economic depression in Suzhou and the bankruptcy of rural areas, the business of pawnshops has declined, suffering heavy losses, and several have been unable to maintain their operations and have closed. Now, Maoyuan Pawnshop in Bao Yaqian, also an old pawnshop with more than 20 years of history, has declared closure due to business failure. It has been reported to the county government yesterday. Dasheng Pawnshop in Tieping Lane is also about to declare closure.</p>

<p>Wuxi Park has been managed by a park management committee separately organized by the Municipal Management Committee, which manages all income and expenditure and various constructions. Recently, the Municipal Management Committee was ordered to be abolished, and disputes arose between various parties regarding the right to manage the park, which are recorded as follows: (1) Elders such as Hua Yishan cited the history of the park, pointing out that the park is not a district property but belongs to the county. Based on past history, a board of directors should be organized by local gentry and former park committee members to manage it. (2) The First District Office believed that Sun Zuji, when he was the county magistrate, had once managed it by the District Office, and that since the park is in the urban area, it naturally belongs to the municipal property, and the municipal property is the district property, which should be managed by the District Office. (3) The County Education Bureau believed that the park is one of the social education facilities and should be managed by the educational authorities, and formulated an improvement plan, preparing to take over. The above points have aroused deep concern among local people, but it is unknown who will win in the end.</p>

<p>The High School Graduation Joint Entrance Examination of the Third District of Jiangsu Province was held yesterday for the second day. At 8:00 AM, it was held on time at the Jiangsu Xishan Normal School. There were two sessions throughout the day, arithmetic in the morning and geography in the afternoon. The test questions were: How many necessary convenient roads are there within China that must pass through foreign countries to get to another part of China? Briefly describe them. Which countries border our country along the border? Briefly explain the border situation.

<p>Wang Tieqian and Pan Ming, two anti-Japanese national heroes from this county during the Jiajing period (of the Ming Dynasty), led the civil defense corps out of the city to meet the invaders when Japanese pirates repeatedly invaded the area. Wang and Pan both died in this battle. (According to historical records, Wang was the magistrate of this county at that time, while Pan was from Luyuan in this county and was a Jinshi graduate.) A Double Loyalty Shrine was built in front of the Liwang Palace in the city. Later, due to the passage of time, the historical traces of the two heroes were almost lost. Later, the Education Department ordered the county to repair the Wang-Pan Double Loyalty Shrine, which once again attracted attention. Now the Double Loyalty Shrine has been completely renovated. The county party department decided that July 5th, the date of martyrdom of the two heroes, will be the date to hold the first memorial service in conjunction with various agencies to honor their loyalty and publicize the deeds of the two heroes to the public.</p>

<p>Yu Jingtang, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Jiangsu Province, recently ordered the county governments to say: "After investigation, the Anti-Opium Committee of this province has been established. Article 2 of its organizational charter stipulates that the Provincial Anti-Opium Committee shall carry out the orders of the Provincial Government, take charge of the anti-opium affairs of the entire province, and supervise the subordinate agencies. The Provincial Anti-Opium Committee is in charge of all anti-opium cases as mandated by orders.

<h3 id="e119">&lt;The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Committee's Report on Improvement Plans, Seeking Fair Criticism by Clarifying Facts, Rickshaw Rental Reduction of Ten Cents Starting in August P]&gt; <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Rickshaw Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession has been actively conducting investigations. Sixteen reform measures were agreed upon and submitted to the Board of Directors for discussion. Thirteen of these measures were passed and announced for implementation. However, the rickshaw owners have consistently and strongly opposed them. Yesterday, the committee specially invited reporters from various newspapers to report the truth of the matter so that the public could understand the facts and offer fair criticism to eliminate long-standing malpractices.</p>
<p>The committee members present yesterday were Zhu Maocheng, Massey, and Director Wang Zhiren. Mr. Zhu first reported on the formation of the committee, stating briefly that the organization of the Rickshaw Committee began in September of last year. At that time, there was widespread criticism and suggestions regarding the corruption of rickshaws in the concession. The Municipal Council then accepted these suggestions and organized this committee, with Massey, Jiang Yiping, Zhu Maocheng, Harrison, and Bo Jian Tuo as members. They began to investigate this issue to determine if improvements were necessary. The investigation revealed many malpractices, so sixteen reform proposals were immediately agreed upon and submitted to the Board of Directors for discussion. As a result, thirteen measures were passed and scheduled to be implemented on July 1st. Unexpectedly, the rickshaw owners strongly opposed them and engaged in malicious propaganda. The committee's role is merely to offer suggestions. If the rickshaw owners have any concerns, they are welcome to meet sincerely, and the committee is willing to promote implementation through peaceful means. Therefore, although the Council has adopted the measures, they have not been enforced with force, and rickshaw rentals have been reduced.</p>
<p>Currently, rickshaw pullers have to pay a rental fee of up to fourteen small silver coins each day, so that the income from their daily labor is almost entirely extorted by the rickshaw owners. According to a careful investigation by this committee, the average income of each rickshaw puller is only 9.23 yuan per month, which must support the needs of several family members. The hardship of their lives can be imagined. From a humanitarian perspective, rickshaw rentals should also be reduced. The Municipal Council passed a regulation setting the rickshaw rental at eight small silver coins per day. Although it was scheduled to be implemented on July 1st, this committee, out of consideration for the rickshaw owners, requested a temporary postponement. It also suggested that starting from August 1st, the daily rickshaw rental should be changed to ten small silver coins, and only be reduced to eight coins from January 1st of the following year. In this way, the gradual reduction should not cause any difficulties.</p>
<p>Key Points of Improvement</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu also stated that the improvement items suggested by this committee include several aspects: (1) Reduce the rickshaw rental to eight coins. Although this has already been passed, for the sake of facilitating implementation, it will first be reduced to ten coins from August 1st. (2) Licenses are not allowed to be resold. (3) Licenses must be obtained by the rickshaw owners themselves, and the rickshaw owners must also obtain rickshaw owner certificates. This matter has already been implemented. (4) Rickshaw pullers will also be issued licenses, because currently, when rickshaw pullers violate regulations, they are often subjected to insults such as beatings and license confiscation. In the future, if there are violations, their license numbers will be recorded for prosecution, and arbitrary kicking and beating will not be allowed, in order to enhance their dignity. (5) Improve the style of rickshaws to make them economical, lightweight, durable, and comfortable. All of these are intended to seek improvements in all aspects. As for the stipulated rickshaw fares, the purpose is also to increase the income of rickshaw pullers and improve their living standards, but it will not be forcibly implemented. However, a standard will be set to avoid disputes over fares between rickshaw pullers and passengers.</p>
<p>Relief Work</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Wang Zhiren reported on the committee's relief work plan, stating that the goal is to achieve self-help for rickshaw pullers through the supervision and assistance of the committee. Therefore, it is planned to organize a rickshaw pullers' mutual aid society. For example, when the rickshaw rental is reduced by ten cents, eleven cents will be collected, and the extra cent will be used as funds to be deposited in a designated bank. There are currently 10,000 rickshaws in the concession, which can generate about 15,000 yuan per month, or about 180,000 yuan per year. The Municipal Council will appoint three supervisors, and representatives from various charitable organizations will be invited to a meeting to discuss and implement various projects, such as medical care and hygiene for rickshaw pullers, education for their children, public dormitories, death benefits, and proper entertainment. It is also hoped that rickshaw pullers will be able to manage and operate themselves with the existing funds, which can be carried out gradually year by year. The benefits to rickshaw pullers will definitely be significant.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Submits a Request</p>
<p>To Clearly Define the Date for Abolishing Harsh and Miscellaneous Taxes and Fees</p>
<p>And Requests a Reduction in Export Tax Rates</p>
<p>Based on the resolutions of the Fifth General Assembly of Representatives, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce specially submitted a request to the Executive Yuan yesterday to clearly define the date for abolishing harsh and miscellaneous taxes and fees. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A request for the matter of submitting a request. The association held the Fifth General Assembly of Members on the 17th of this month. According to the joint proposal of representatives Ye Jiaxing, Cheng Yujie, Yuan Hongjun, Ma Jisheng, etc., a request was submitted to the government to clearly define the date for implementing the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes and fees, and to request a reduction in export taxes. The proposal stated that, "At present, all industries are declining, and commerce and industry are in distress. People feel overwhelmed by the various harsh and miscellaneous taxes and fees of the country. At the same time, the national finances are on the verge of exhaustion, and there is a sense that there is nothing left to exploit. This abnormal contradiction is the most profound and serious problem in our country today, which urgently needs to be addressed and resolved. Although the central government has issued orders to abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes and fees, implementation still requires time. Export trade, in particular, should be supported. In order to consider the interests of both parties, it is proposed that the central government quickly define the date for implementing the abolition and appropriately reduce the export trade tax to alleviate the suffering of merchants and people. At the same time, implement a state monopoly on cigarettes to increase revenue and enrich the national treasury. Is this appropriate? A request is submitted for public deliberation."</p>
<p>It was found that the association had previously received a telegram stating that all harsh and miscellaneous taxes and fees would be abolished in stages within the second half of this year. After reporting this to the General Assembly for discussion, it was believed that the proposal regarding the implementation date for abolishing harsh and miscellaneous taxes and fees had been resolved by the Executive Yuan, which was determined to supervise and urge the provinces to strictly adhere to the deadlines. The people would be freed from their suffering, and the time should not be far off. All proposals to increase the tax rate on consumable cigarettes to compensate for the reduction in export taxes should be considered by the central government as a means of improving tax revenue. It was resolved that the case should be forwarded to the Executive Yuan for review, approval, and implementation, which would be in the public interest.</p>

<p>China Aviation Corporation Cables to the US</p>
<p>To Change the Order to New Douglas Dolphin Aircraft</p>
<p>The Longhua Seaplane Port is Underway with Land Acquisition</p>
<p>New Southwest and Kangzang Routes are Actively Being Planned</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Guangdong Route is Expected to Resume Within the Year</p>
<p>The China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong route has been temporarily suspended since the accident involving the Sikorsky aircraft. The company had previously cabled to the United States to order two new Commodore aircraft. According to Mr. Dai Enji, General Manager of the company, who spoke to a reporter from Shen Shi News Agency, they have now cabled to the United States to change the order to two new Douglas Dolphin aircraft. The route is expected to resume within the year. At the same time, preparations are being made for the opening of the new Southwest and Kangzang routes. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Changing the Order to New Aircraft for Route Resumption Within the Year</p>
<p>According to Mr. Dai, the previous order for Commodore aircraft from the United States was decided by the Board of Directors. However, the structure of the aircraft is complex, and construction is time-consuming. Moreover, it is a model from four or five years ago in the United States, which is slightly slower compared to the latest aircraft. For the convenience of passengers, the company recently cabled to the United States to change the order to two of the latest Douglas Dolphin aircraft. Each of these aircraft can carry eighteen people and has two engines. The fuselage is sturdy, and the speed is the highest, averaging 150 miles per hour. The American side is actively rushing to build the aircraft after receiving the cable. It is expected to be completed in August and shipped to China. Around mid-October, after adding parts and test flights, it will be formally used within December to resume the Shanghai-Guangdong route. According to Mr. Dai, although these two aircraft are sufficient for the Shanghai-Guangdong route, in order to prevent accidents and develop business, they will continue to purchase one more aircraft. They will cable to the American side again soon to request another aircraft to be built at the same time as the previous two and shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Longhua Airport is Underway with Land Acquisition</p>
<p>For the sake of improving flight equipment, the company plans to expand Longhua Airport. This has been reported in various newspapers. According to Mr. Dai yesterday, this project is extremely large and cannot be undertaken by the company alone. Moreover, there may be complications when purchasing land from the people. It is necessary to request assistance from the local authorities. Currently, the company has sent personnel to survey and negotiate land purchase procedures with the surrounding farmers. A small amount has recently been purchased. It is planned to gradually expand the airport and then proceed with the construction of rest areas, restaurants, and other facilities in order to realize the original plan.</p>
<p>Planning New Southwest and Kangzang Routes</p>
<p>Mr. Dai continued, "Aviation transportation is extremely important to the inland. Unfortunately, the company's current strength is insufficient and cannot be realized one by one. However, we are actively planning for this and striving to open the new Southwest and Kangzang routes at the same time in the shortest possible time. Once the planning has made some progress, we will still purchase aircraft from the American side for use."</p>

<p>Scheduled to Host Various Sectors</p>
<p>To Report on Objections to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Committee Regulations</p>
<p>Advise Rickshaw Owners to Seriously Implement Resolutions of the General Assembly</p>
<p>The Special District Office of the Rickshaw Industry, after establishing a special committee in opposition to the regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Committee, held its second meeting at the association at 9 PM last night. Wan An served as the chairman and reported on the previous session's minutes, and then began discussions and resolutions: (1) Starting immediately, all committee members will go to various rickshaw owners to promote the serious implementation of the General Assembly's resolutions. (2) Publish a special issue, the content of which will describe the steps taken by rickshaw owners to help rickshaw pullers, in order to clarify matters to all sectors of society. (3) The special committee will regularly host the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Public Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association, the French Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association, all executive and supervisory committee members, news reporters from major newspapers, and leaders from all sectors to report on the progress and seek assistance from all sectors of society. (4) In the future, the special committee will hold a meeting every night from 8 PM to 9 PM, and the meeting will be adjourned at 10 PM.</p>

<p>County Land Price Tax to be Levied at the Beginning of Next Month</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance Strictly Pursues Overdue Taxes</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government, with the end of the 22nd year approaching and the first installment of the 23rd year's land price tax urgently needing preparation for collection, has decided to set up counters for collection at the beginning of next month. Yesterday, it ordered the tax collection office to comply. The county government has now received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, stating briefly that the assessment of the collection of field taxes for the 22nd year is based on the end of June of the 23rd year as the assessment period. This time, there is a grace period of two years, which can be included before the end of June, which is out of consideration. The assessment must be carried out on schedule, and efforts should be made to strictly pursue taxes within the regular and extended periods. Don't be negligent in pursuing the taxes, lest you be punished. After receiving the order, the county government immediately supervised the tax collection office and the various tax collectors to actively collect taxes and pursue them within the prescribed time limit.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Designates Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax for Local Collection</p>
<p>Following the Resolutions of the National Financial Conference</p>
<p>To be Implemented from July 1st</p>
<p>The tobacco and alcohol license tax originally belonged to the nature of business tax, and was collected by the provincial and municipal stamp tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus under the Ministry of Finance. Recently, after discussion at the National Financial Conference, it was decided that from July 1st, the license tax will be designated for collection by local governments. The Ministry of Finance specially consulted the provincial and municipal governments and provincial financial departments for reference, and ordered the provincial stamp tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus to stop collection by the end of June. The original text of the consultation order is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Consultation to the Provincial and Municipal Governments</p>
<p>All financial departments and financial bureaus, the case in question is that the tobacco and alcohol license tax is inherently a business nature. In June of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the National Government promulgated the Business Tax Law, which stipulates in Article 2 that "of the tobacco and alcohol license tax collected by the central government, 10% should be retained by the central government, and the rest should be allocated to the provinces and cities as local revenue." The provincial stamp tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus directly under the Ministry have been collecting taxes in accordance with the regulations, and the payments have been allocated separately. At this time, the Ministry convened the National Financial Conference to address the issue of reducing the field tax surcharge in various provinces and cities and abolishing harsh miscellaneous taxes and fees, and the methods of compensation. Because there was concern that local financial resources would be insufficient, the conference resolved to allocate the entire tobacco and alcohol license tax to the localities, to be collected by the localities, in order to increase income. And according to the Secretariat of the Conference, the resolution was submitted for approval. The Ministry also added verification. This tobacco and alcohol license tax, according to the provisions of the Business Tax Law, should have been collected by the central government, but since there are previous circumstances, the Ministry, in order to adjust local finances, should allow it to be changed to local self-management, for the convenience of tax collection. It is now decided that from July 1st of this year, the allocation will be implemented. Please ask your provincial and municipal governments to instruct the financial department (bureau) to comply with the central laws and regulations, to continue to collect taxes. The required spring, summer, autumn and winter seasons tobacco and alcohol wholesale or retail licenses will still be printed by the Ministry, and the department (bureau) should be ordered to list the detailed number, prepare printing costs, and submit to the Ministry for use, in order to unify and facilitate assessment. In addition to consulting separately with the provincial and municipal governments and financial departments, to receive and start operations from the beginning of the 21st year, and issuing a notice to the provincial stamp tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus to instruct their subordinate branches to end the assessment of tobacco and alcohol license tax matters by the deadline, and report to the Executive Yuan to be presented to the National Government for approval and record, a copy of the Provisional Regulations and Implementation Rules for Tobacco and Alcohol Business License Tax is enclosed for your provincial and municipal governments to check and process. It is still hoped that you will reply. As for the handling after receipt, and how to reduce the burden on the people, please also instruct to handle earnestly and report to the Ministry at any time for verification.</p>
<p>Order to Various Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureaus</p>
<p>Also instructing the provincial stamp tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus, the case in question is that the tobacco and alcohol license tax is inherently a business nature. In June of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the National Government promulgated the Business Tax Law, which stipulates in Article 2 that "of the tobacco and alcohol license tax collected by the central government, 10% should be retained by the central government, and the rest should be allocated to the provinces and cities as local revenue." The implementation has been carried out accordingly. At this time, the Ministry convened the National Financial Conference to address the issue of reducing the field tax surcharge in various provinces and cities and abolishing harsh miscellaneous taxes and fees, and the methods of compensation. Because there was concern that local financial resources would be insufficient, the conference resolved to allocate the entire tobacco and alcohol license tax to the localities, to be collected by the localities, in order to increase income. And according to the Secretariat of the Conference, the resolution was submitted for approval. The Ministry also added verification. This tobacco and alcohol license tax, according to the provisions of the Business Tax Law, should have been collected by the central government, but since there are previous circumstances, the Ministry, in order to adjust local finances, should allow it to be changed to local self-management, for the convenience of tax collection. It is now decided that from July 1st of this year, the allocation will be implemented, and the provincial and municipal governments should be handed over to continue collecting taxes in accordance with the central laws and regulations. The bureau should be ordered to telegraph its subordinate branches to end all matters related to the assessment of tobacco and alcohol license tax matters by June 30th of this year. All autumn license taxes for this year must not be collected again. The bureau's remaining licenses of various types and quantities should be made into a clear list and submitted by the bureau to the Ministry, and it is not allowed to be left outside, in order to prevent abuses. Violators will be dealt with for unclear cases. In addition to notifying the provincial stamp tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus to end on schedule, and consulting separately with the provincial governments and financial departments, to receive and start operations from the beginning of the 23rd year, and report to the Executive Yuan to be presented to the National Government for approval and record, it is appropriate to order you to report on the handling of the situation for verification. This order.</p>
<p>Tax Office Interpretation</p>
<p>Regulations on the Collection of Special Tax on Wheat Flour</p>
<p>All Wheat Flour Not Made from Wheat by Machine is Exempted from Tax</p>
<p>Yesterday's instructions to all district unified tax bureaus to be informed</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Tax Office in this port previously requested an interpretation of the ambiguity of the word "wheat flour" from the Customs Administration regarding the collection of special tax on wheat flour. Yesterday, a reporter from Shen Shi News learned that the Tax Office has replied to the Customs Administration and instructed all district bureaus under its jurisdiction to be informed. The original order stated, "The Customs Administration's Document No. 1780 was approved, stating that, according to the report of the Acting Tax Commissioner, it is necessary to clearly define whether the word 'wheat flour' refers to wheat or includes various wheat flours, in order to distinguish between tariff exemptions and levies. Please provide a reply for reference." "The regulations on the collection of special tax on wheat flour stipulate in Article 3 that all non-machine-made wheat flour bran and wheat used as raw materials are not subject to tax." The target of taxation specifically refers to wheat flour bran made from wheat raw materials by machine, and the meaning is very clear. In other words, all wheat bran that is not made from wheat as raw material and is not made by machine is not subject to tax, so there is no doubt. However, the wheat flour item was originally established for the purpose of offsetting the customs duties, in order to levy the customs duties on raw material wheat and change it to a special tax on wheat flour. When the business was opened, the wheat duties had not yet been abolished. Various wheat flour factories purchased raw material wheat, and the Ministry issued tax exemption certificates to give special exemptions from customs duties. Other wheat that was not used by the various wheat flour factories and other types of wheat still had to pay customs duties in order to equalize the burden. Later, before the abolition of customs duties, part of the wheat duties was universally exempted. Since various types</p>

<p>The finances of Hubei Province were originally very difficult. In the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933], every effort was made to economize, and revenue and expenditure were balanced. In addition, old debts of approximately 3.5 million yuan were repaid. The budget for the 23rd year [i.e., 1934] has also been decided. All revenue is based on the actual receipts of the previous year as a standard. On the expenditure side, in addition to increasing expenditure on projects by several hundred thousand yuan, there is no increase in administrative expenses. The revenue and expenditure are roughly the same as in the previous year. As for the 70 million yuan Class A debt and over 1 million yuan in bank debts owed by the Hubei Provincial Government, since being restructured, they have now been completely paid off and will soon be finalized.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Re-establishing the Hubei River Police <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Hubei River Police were extremely corrupt. Since I took office, I immediately ordered the River Police to be suspended and used the original River Police funds to accumulate savings, ordering two gunboats and six patrol boats from the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy. The original old ships of the River Police will also be renovated, and a River Police Training Institute will be established to train personnel and re-establish the River Police. The first phase of the plan is scheduled to begin in September. As for the eight new ships being built, they should be completed by the end of the month. The Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy is a public institution, so they work diligently, and the construction costs are also quite fair.</p>

<p>Currently in Hubei Province, apart from small groups of remnant bandits still existing on the borders, the interior is free of bandit activity. All the dikes throughout the province can also be fully completed before the high-water season. This year's water level is about six to seven feet lower than last year, and the floods will not lead to disaster. Hubei Province has suffered from banditry and floods for years in a row, and the rural economy was almost bankrupt. Fortunately, last year's harvest was good, and the livelihoods of the farmers were slightly improved. Based on observations of the weather and geography this year, it is hoped that the vitality of the rural areas can be restored.</p>

<p>Starting in March of this year, Hubei Province implemented the management and operation of inland river merchant ships on behalf of owners, and the results have been very good so far. At the beginning of the implementation, merchants and the public had some misunderstandings. Subsequently, a supervisory committee was established, composed of the chairman of the Hankou Bankers' Association, the chairman of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Commerce, two representatives of shipping merchants, and one representative each from the Provincial Government's Finance Department and Construction Department. The powers are (1) supervising accounting; (2) reviewing business plans and reports; (3) suggesting improvements. Since its implementation, business has been progressing day by day, prices are also one-third cheaper than before, the time is accurate, and all the bad habits of the shipping industry have been eliminated. On the one hand, shipping merchants are given guarantees, and on the other hand, passengers are provided with convenience. Government and merchants cooperate wholeheartedly, and misunderstandings are completely eliminated.</p>

The congress handed the case over to the committee on proposed motions for review, which resolved that the rent reduction measures in this city, as consistently advocated by our association, should be formulated by the municipal authorities after considering all parties' circumstances, in order to achieve comprehensive planning and consideration without hindering implementation. The Municipal Advisory Council has also convened both parties to solicit opinions and is preparing to draft appropriate measures. Previously, the Coal Industry Association passed a resolution at its general meeting to petition the government for approval of equitable rent reduction, which our association also submitted to the Municipal Government in accordance with its consistent advocacy, requesting the Municipal Government to approve the comprehensive and considerate measures as soon as possible and announce their implementation.

<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that a German named Mr. Liddig set off from his hometown of Treiden by bicycle in 1932 to circumnavigate the globe. He recently arrived in Hankou from Guangzhou and came to Shanghai by waterway, arriving in port last night. He has traveled 14,000 miles since he started. He plans to stay in Shanghai for eight days, then drive to Beijing via Hangzhou, and then go north to Tianjin, which he expects to reach in two weeks. Mr. Liddig has passed through Venice, Athens, Istanbul, Baghdad, and other places, and then entered India. In Calcutta, his bicycle was damaged, so he replaced it with a new one. After leaving Guangzhou on May 18th, he averaged 100 miles per day. On flat roads, he could travel 10 miles per hour, but near the border of Hunan, the roads were rugged and difficult to travel, and sometimes the person had to carry the bicycle. He finally arrived in Hankou on June 6th. After visiting Korea and Japan, Mr. Liddig plans to cross the Pacific to the United States and then drive across the Americas to reach the Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, for the convenience of citizens making calls, installed public telephones in shops throughout the city in the spring of last year. Since the installation and commissioning of these telephones, the public has deeply understood the convenience of public telephones. Therefore, several merchants and companies request installation every day. The telephone bureau installs them in locations it deems suitable. Currently, there are more than 90 locations in the city where these telephones have been installed and are in service, which shows that public telephones have been welcomed and are happy to be used by people in society.

<h3 id="e137">Employee of Livestock Plantation Company Sentenced for Enticing and Raping Farmer's Daughter <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Jiang A'yu, a farmer in Jiangwan Township, has a daughter, named A'zeng, who is 19 years old this year and works in the fields at home. Although A'zeng was born into a farming family, she is very beautiful. Since Jiangwan has adopted the urban atmosphere of Shanghai, she also cut her hair short and wears fashionable clothes when she is not working. Those who do not know her would never think she is a rural woman from the fields, so she and her father think highly of themselves and are unwilling to marry a local man. Therefore, her marriage prospects have been vacant. However, she has reached the age of marriage, and she cannot help but feel sentimental in the moonlight. It happened that Gu Huang, an employee of the Livestock Plantation Company in that area, met her, was astonished by her beauty, and enticed her, leading to a secret pregnancy. Gu Huang took this opportunity to entice A'zeng to hide in Fahua, but unexpectedly, Chief Gu had a wife and had already given birth to a son. Therefore, A'zeng was four months pregnant, her belly was bulging, and it was difficult for her to see her father, and she was unwilling to be a concubine, so love turned to hatred. At this time, she turned around and sent a message to her father, who took his daughter out and sued Gu in court. After trial yesterday, the examining official ruled that Gu should compensate the Jiang father and daughter 300 yuan, and Gu was sentenced to six months in prison for enticement and rape.</p>

<p>Liu Si, a native of Suqian, at No. 12 Xiaohuayuan, Huining Road, Nanshi, has no occupation. Every day, he goes to the trees in the fields to collect birds and insects and sells them to birdkeepers in the city temple to make a living. There is only his old wife, Liu Zhang, who is already 50 years old, has no children, and few brothers. The two elderly people are extremely poor. Liu Zhang also suffers from illness. Recently, she has been suffering from joint pain, confined to bed, and unable to bear the pain. She also has no money for medical treatment, so she thought that instead of enduring this painful life, it would be better to die sooner. Therefore, she had long intended to commit suicide. At 7:00 AM yesterday, while her husband was selling insects in the city, she got up alone and hanged herself on the bedpost. When her husband returned at noon, he saw his old partner commit suicide and burst into loud cries. The police arrived after the patrolman was informed, clarified the cause, and reported it to the Second District Police Station, who transferred the order to the local bailiff Gu Xueyuan to report to the local court to request an inspection.</p>

<p>▲ Sun Shiying Broadcasts "The Doctrine of the Mean": Mr. Sun Shiying, a scholar of Chinese studies hired by the Youlian Radio Station on Avenue Joffre in this city, lectures on secondary school subjects. Originally scheduled to lecture on Mencius, he later responded to the special request of the audience to lecture on "The Doctrine of the Mean."

Its meaning is not fully conveyed, but it is actually connected to the source and flow of Confucius's teachings. It is like the "Tao Te Ching" and "Zhuangzi" of Taoism, and the "Diamond Sutra" of Buddhism. Mr. Sun once said to someone, "The 'Analects', 'Mencius', 'The Great Learning', and 'The Doctrine of the Mean' are books for learning, with their beginnings and ends, their order of importance. They are doors to esoteric and exoteric, gradual and sudden teachings. The way to illustrate the relationship between heaven and man is the 'Doctrine of the Mean' as the most important." The daily broadcasting time is from 7:30 AM to 8:30 AM. From the second section of the twentieth chapter, Duke Ai's question on government (starting from the 23rd of this month), the lecture notes will be published daily in the wireless radio column of the Shishi Xinbao for the convenience of the audience.</p>

<p>To the Editor: We have recently read the section "University Student Huang Naiwu Holds a Grudge Against a Dancing Girl and Poisons Her" in the local news column of your newspaper for the past two days. It states that Huang Naiwu is studying at a university on Route Lugny in the French Concession. After investigation, we found that there is only one university on Route Lugny in our school, and there is no such person as Huang Naiwu among the students. We immediately investigated with the police station, and Huang Naiwu also claimed that he was not studying at our school. This is clearly a misreport, so we are sending this letter to correct it and request that it be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column. Sincerely, Zhen Dan University, June 22.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Special Feature: The Collapse of the National Economy: The Awakening of National Cooperative Production by Wu Tiecheng 丨Speech at the General Assembly of the Chinese Economic Credit Cooperative Mobilization Team on June 9th丨 <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Chairman and distinguished guests, I am attending the general assembly of the Economic Credit Cooperative Mobilization Team today, and I have a very good feeling seeing all of you present. This feeling is that a new force of people involved in social undertakings in Shanghai has emerged to participate. In the past, we often saw that those who were involved in social undertakings in Shanghai were always the same few people coming and going. But today, I have seen many new faces. Among them, there are many friends I know, but whether I know them or not, I believe that all of you present today are not participating because of personal relationships, but because you have a considerable understanding and interest in the Economic Credit Cooperative. From this, it can be seen that the number of people participating in social undertakings in Shanghai is increasing day by day. This is a very good phenomenon in Shanghai, and it is also something I, as a public servant of the locality, am grateful for regarding the future of Shanghai.</p>
<p>China, in the era of isolationism, was an agricultural economic era of self-cultivation and self-weaving. At that time, people's lives were very simple, and the living materials they needed were also very simple. What we needed, we could provide for ourselves, so at that time, there was no talk of a national economic life. For example, if we wanted to eat, we could cultivate it ourselves. If we wanted to wear clothes, we could spin yarn and weave cloth ourselves. Life was extremely simple at that time. However, since the Opium War, foreign cannons opened the door to China. Chinese politics suffered a blow, and because of this blow, changes occurred. This change has been continuing non-stop for the past eighty or ninety years, and the general life of the people has also undergone a great change due to this great influence, which is the revolution of life. However, in this nearly century-long tide of great change and great revolution, we have actually not established an economic organization that conforms to modern economic principles. Therefore, although China has been changing non-stop every day for the past century, the general public is still unaware and has not paid attention to the fluctuations of this era. The most obvious revolution in our lives can be seen in the cities. As long as we compare our lives in the cities with the lives of people in the countryside, we can know how much our lives have been affected by the fluctuations of this world trend. But when we think about it thoroughly, we are still behind the times. We have not moved forward in accordance with the trend of the times. As for our economic organization, it is still very simple. Most people do not have a recognition of modern economic organizations, so they cannot generate the effect of organization, and many new organizations and new plans often fail. This is such a pity.</p>
<p>Since we cannot return to the state of life a hundred or fifty years ago, and we cannot leave the city to live the lives of our ancestors in the countryside, we must plan for ourselves. If one person cannot plan, then many people should come together to plan. However, our general public only knows how to consume and is unwilling to produce. It's as if people want to ride in cars, but we ourselves don't know how to manufacture them. But the general public believes that we have plenty of money, so we can take the money to buy cars manufactured by others. If we want to wear suits, and the woolen products we produce ourselves are not good, we can buy imported goods. We don't care if our money is taken away by others, as long as we are beautiful and comfortable. These wishful thinking calculations are certainly very good for individuals, but the result of such wishful thinking calculations will lead our nation to its death. We don't need to look elsewhere, just look at Shanghai. People in Shanghai who used to be wealthy lived in three-story shikumen houses. Now, the wealth of the wealthy is actually not much more than those who used to live in three-story houses, or only slightly more. And they all want to go to the quiet areas of the Western District to live in very modern and complete Western-style houses. Everyone enjoys enjoyment, but one day, our money will be used up invisibly, and we will be deeply led to the death of our nation. Just now, Mr. Zhang Shouyong reported that our customs deficit last year reached as much as 700 million yuan. The only skill our ancestors passed down to us was farming, but now even the country's food supply cannot be self-sufficient and still relies on foreigners. Not to mention other cotton and woolen fabrics for clothing. China is known as a country that stands on agriculture, and the Chinese people's skill in farming is famous throughout the world. The farming methods of many rice-eating nations in the world are mostly taught to them by us. But now the rice that the Chinese eat has to be transported from foreign countries. How can this be allowed? As for the wheat that our compatriots in the north eat, most of it also has to rely on foreign imports, so that last year the import of agricultural products accounted for 250 million yuan of the total deficit of 700 million yuan. That is, the woolen and cotton fabrics that we wear also nearly reached 100 million yuan. Our ancestors never expected that there would be such unpromising descendants who enjoy themselves every day and do not know that we are now enjoying ourselves, and our descendants will have no chance to live in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must not only plan for ourselves now, but also plan for our descendants. Our ancestors planned a lot for us. Three years ago, when we flew from Beijing to Nanjing and then to Hangzhou, passing through the wealthy areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, we could see very clearly from the air. Such as the organization of the countryside, the rivers, fields, roads, etc., our ancestors had arranged everything for our descendants. We cannot take the industry left to us by our ancestors, as well as the survival skills taught to us, and promote them. We are truly unpromising. We must not harm our descendants. We must be able to carry on the past and open up the future, so that our descendants can survive generation after generation. If we only plan for ourselves now and not for our descendants, what will we give them in the future and teach them to inherit our cause? Therefore, we should not just enjoy ourselves now, not just plan for ourselves, but also plan for our descendants. Eighteen years ago, when I returned from Honolulu, I met an old American woman on the ship. She told me that I had been to China several times and had seen many Chinese students go to the United States to study medicine every year. After graduating and returning to China, they should plan for the public health of various places in China. However, the public health of various places in China is still as unhygienic as before. She also said that those Chinese who returned from studying medicine in the United States only knew how to keep the inside of their houses very clean, with all kinds of sanitary facilities and ditches, etc., very complete. But outside the house, they didn't care about anything. In this way, it is certainly good for one person to pay attention to hygiene, but what is the use of one person's hygiene? It is necessary to know that without paying attention to public health, one person's hygiene is useless. It's like the many poor people in Zhabei, whose food, clothing, and shelter are all very dirty and easily lead to epidemics. After an epidemic breaks out in the area, those of us who pay attention to hygiene will also be infected by them. Therefore, we must plan as a whole, not only for ourselves now, but also for our descendants in the future.</p>
<p>I remember the year before last, the National Women's Christian Association held a representative meeting in Shanghai, with hundreds of women representatives from all over the country, most of whom came from rural villages in the interior. One day, they invited me to give a speech. The first thing I told them was, I said, "Everyone, you have come to Shanghai this time to attend the National Women's Christian Association Representative Meeting. Most of you have never been to Shanghai before. Now that you have suddenly come to Shanghai and seen that the Shanghai market is so prosperous and the people's lives are so extravagant and romantic, you must not have the wrong ideas in your minds. You must know that Shanghai's current prosperity is not real prosperity, and the extravagant and romantic lives of those special classes of people in Shanghai are not the result of their genuine efforts and contributions to society and the country. Please recognize these two points clearly and do not have the wrong ideas. If you see this false prosperity in Shanghai and the extravagant lives that are not obtained by your own efforts and develop the wrong ideas, then you will inevitably make many mistakes when you go back to work in the interior in the future." This is what I said to the national women's youth representatives first. (See my book "The Revival of the Chinese Nation and the Women's Movement" published in major newspapers in Shanghai.) The Rotary Club once held a meeting and meal and invited me to give a speech. I boldly said to them, "Shanghai's prosperity is certainly what every citizen living in Shanghai hopes for. But Shanghai has already prospered to this point today. Our efforts in the future should not make Shanghai's prosperity become a deformed state. Our first step is to strive to maintain the current prosperity. Only by maintaining the current prosperity can we further prosper in the future. Because Shanghai's prosperity today is not the result of the efforts of Shanghai citizens in the past. In other words, the efforts of Shanghai citizens in the past should not have resulted in such prosperity today. Today's prosperity in Shanghai is very strange, and there are other reasons involved. We know that the prosperity of a city is due to the joint efforts of all the people in the city, regardless of whether they are in agriculture, industry, commerce, or education. But judging from the past efforts of Shanghai citizens, today's prosperity should not exist." That's why I said that Shanghai's prosperity is false. How can false prosperity last? Therefore, I once compared Shanghai to a fish. Fish cannot live without water. So, where is the water? The water is in the rural villages in the interior. Now that our rural villages are on the verge of bankruptcy, the water has dried up. If the water dries up, how can the fish live? Therefore, if we want Shanghai's prosperity, we must also take into account the revival of the rural villages in the interior and the maintenance of the livelihoods of the farmers. If we can maintain the livelihoods of the farmers and jointly revive the rural villages, then the source of water will not dry up, and the fish in Shanghai will be able to survive. This is what I said and cited at the Rotary Club. (See my book (1) "The Basic Principles of a Prosperous Greater Shanghai" published in major newspapers in Shanghai (2) "The Future of Shanghai" published in the New China Magazine supplement.) However, I am a local official and also a local public servant. At the same time, you are Shanghai citizens and also the masters of Shanghai. It seems that I should not have said these words about Shanghai's prosperity being false in front of the masters. However, I, as a public servant, should be responsible for doing my best to improve these pathological conditions in Shanghai. As the masters of Shanghai, you should also understand and not avoid treatment. Therefore, I am pointing out these pathological conditions today, hoping that everyone will help the government to improve them together.</p>
<p>In short, although our economic organization and the state of the people's lives have undergone great changes, our economic organization is still unable to adapt to modern needs. Without a modern economic organization, our lives cannot become modern lives. Now is the era of an industrial economy with division of labor and cooperation, and not an agricultural economic era where everyone is on their own. Now our livelihood problems cannot be solved by ourselves alone. We must combine everyone's strength to solve everyone's problems. If everyone's problems can be solved, then our individual little problems can also be solved. Based on the spirit of equality, mutual assistance, and mutual benefit, we can seek the common interests of each individual and realize group life. This is the purpose of your Economic Credit Cooperative and is also the conclusion I want to contribute to you today.</p>
<p>Finally, I am very happy to see so many new faces here today. I myself am a local official and also a person who likes to participate in social undertakings. Whenever there is any guest meeting or undertaking, even in the midst of my busy schedule, I am very willing to participate. Therefore, I am very happy that many new forces have joined social undertakings. I hope that every time I participate in social undertakings, the people I see are different every time, and that everyone in society is engaged in social undertakings. Only in this way can society have a solution and the country have a solution. This is a little bit of my shallow opinion that I am contributing to you today. (End) June 1934 in Shanghai.</p>

<p>1.  The subjects for academic and practical examinations in each term should be implemented according to the progress stipulated in the school's military education program.</p>
<p>2.  Scores of 80 or above are graded as A, 70 or above as B, 60 or above as C, and below 60 as failing.</p>
<p>3.  Examination periods are conducted in terms of academic year, term, summer vacation, etc., and held in stages at appropriate times.</p>
<p>4.  Students who fail military training in any academic year are not allowed to be promoted.</p>
<p>5.  Students whose absences in a term exceed one-third of the total military training hours in that term (or one-sixth for absences without leave) are not allowed to take the term examination, unless on special leave.</p>
<p>6.  Deductions for absences without leave, etc., in a term shall be handled according to the established practices of the school's academic affairs department.</p>
<p>7.  The average score of military training at the end of the term for secondary and higher education students and the centralized training score for graduates (which may be waived before explicit implementation) will be used as the military training score.</p>
<p>8.  The military training score for each term is determined by averaging the academic and practical scores. Practical subjects in grade A are examined at the end of each term, but the score must still be averaged with the temporary examination score. Grade B academic subjects are divided into two categories: excellence and diligence, each accounting for 50% of the total score. The excellence score is assessed during the examination, and the diligence score is determined at the end of the term based on the student's usual absences without leave, etc. (1) No points are deducted for absences due to special leave. (2) No points are deducted for absences due to sick or personal leave within two weeks. For each absence beyond that, one point is deducted. (3) Two points are deducted for each absence without leave.</p>

<p>(Examples)</p>
<p>Academic Year (First academic year score: 67, Second academic year score: 75): Add them together and divide by the number of academic years to obtain the military training completion score.</p>
<p>Term (Average academic and practical score of temporary examination: 66,</p>
<p>Average academic and practical score of term examination: 72):</p>

Its concrete achievements, such as holding tree planting campaigns, opening children's happiness exhibitions, eradicating black smut disease, and opening agricultural product exhibitions, have all aroused the strong interest and enthusiastic participation of the people in the area. Recently, the area has also led the people in building a highway, with more than a hundred laborers working daily. Work began at the end of last month, and in a span of ten days, a highway has been built, starting from Zhongshan Road, passing through the villages of Jinjia Lane, Meiyuan, Yangjiazhai, Xujiazhai, Jiebang, Zhuangjia Bridge, and Jiujiang Caijia Bridge, for a total length of about six or seven li. The road is about twelve feet wide and very flat. The coal slag laid on the ground was allocated by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, totaling 200 cubic meters, and has now been fully completed. It is heard that the area is scheduled to hold a highway completion ceremony on the 24th of this month, and will also open a term performance exhibition. Yesterday, invitations were sent to the political, military, academic, and press circles in the city to participate and provide guidance, and people from all walks of life are welcome to visit and observe.</p>

<p>Northeast Jiaotong University, formerly located in Jin County, Liaoning Province, had its school buildings bombed by the Japanese army during the September 18th Incident and was moved to Peiping, where it has been administered by Northeast University for three years now. The school has a total of three classes of students, all of whom are simple, studious, and do not indulge in bad habits. After the first class graduated last summer, they were assigned by the Railway Department to the Pinghan, Pingsui, and Beining Railways for internships, and their performance was excellent. The second class of 42 students took their graduation examinations earlier this month. In order to verify what they have learned, the students of this class organized a National Railway Visit Group, which departed from Peiping on the 13th of the month and arrived in Nanjing and Hangzhou. Yesterday, they arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou and plan to visit here for five or six days before transferring to Hankou to await instructions from President Zhang Xueliang. They will then return to Peiping via the Pinghan Railway.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Central University in the Past Two Years <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Jialun</p>
<p>National Central University underwent significant reorganization in the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932). I, Jialun, arrived at the school to take charge on September 5th of that year. Two academic years have passed in the blink of an eye. Fortunately, with the government's support and guidance, and the united efforts of the entire school to seek progress, we have achieved a state of relative stability and laid a rough foundation for enrichment and development. At the beginning of the second academic year, I said that in the past year, students not only had books to read but also studied diligently, and professors not only had books to teach but also taught conscientiously. Now, as the second academic year is about to end, I deeply feel that this academic year has continued the spirit of the first academic year and has only increased, not diminished. Building a perfect national university cannot be achieved in one leap. There are still many areas for improvement, but there are some things that can be reported about the situation in the past two years. Therefore, I will list them briefly for your wise instruction.</p>
<p>Newly Built Seed Room of the College of Agriculture, National Central University</p>
<p>1.  Reorganization of Colleges and Departments: The school originally had eight colleges: Arts, Science, Law, Education, Engineering, Agriculture, Medicine, and Commerce. Later, the Executive Yuan decided to make the Colleges of Medicine and Commerce in Shanghai independent, leaving six colleges. Among them, the departments still needed reorganization. Therefore, after considering the resolutions of the Reorganization Committee, complex departments such as Education and Sociology were merged. Departments that were more relevant to the actual needs of the country, such as the Department of Chemical Engineering in the College of Engineering and the Departments of Horticulture and Sericulture in the College of Agriculture, were restored. As a result of the reorganization, there are still six colleges and three departments. The College of Arts has five departments: Chinese Literature, Foreign Literature, Philosophy, History, and Sociology. The College of Science has six departments: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Geology, Geography, and Biology. The College of Law has three departments: Law, Political Science, and Economics. The College of Education has two departments: Education and Psychology, and three divisions: Arts, Physical Education, and Health Education. The College of Engineering has five departments: Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Architectural Engineering, and Chemical Engineering. The College of Agriculture has six departments: Agronomy, Forestry, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Agricultural Chemistry, Horticulture, and Sericulture.</p>
<p>2.  Reorganization of Curriculum: University curricula in our country often have a large number of subjects and lack organic organization. Therefore, each college and department of the school separately redefined its educational goals and reorganized its curriculum, so that required and elective courses have clear regulations and are not subject to change due to individuals or circumstances. Once the core of the curriculum is formed, the meaning of teaching can be clarified. Fortunately, with the efforts and assistance of the deans, department heads, and professors, this work was largely completed after a long period of discussion lasting a year.</p>
<p>3.  Focusing on Scholars and Emphasizing Full-Time Positions: Academics are inherently a specialized undertaking, and professors should devote themselves wholeheartedly. The school has suffered from years of turmoil and often feels empty. At the beginning of the reorganization, we made great efforts to retain good professors and recruited specialized scholars at any time. We asked those who could be full-time to be full-time. Taking this academic year as an example, a total of 76 professors were hired for the six colleges, of which 41 were full-time and 35 were part-time. In terms of the total number of courses taught, part-time professors teach only one-quarter of the courses taught by full-time professors. Most of the original professors who were retained were also full-time. I will not list them all here. Currently, most of the part-time professors are experts in certain specialized sciences, who are valued by the government and other academic institutions. We wanted to recruit them, but it was impossible in reality. We are deeply grateful for their assistance to the school.</p>
<p>4.  Increasing Buildings and Equipment: To understand the difficulty of increasing buildings and equipment at the school, one must understand the school's financial situation. Before the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), the school's budget was 2.04 million yuan. In the 20th year (1931), it was 1.92 million yuan (both including the expenses of the Colleges of Medicine and Commerce, but in the 20th year, there was a slight deduction due to the national crisis). In the 21st year (1932), the budget was still 1.92 million yuan. Later, due to the independence of the Colleges of Medicine and Commerce, in addition to the original expenses being split off, the school headquarters also allocated an additional 24,000 yuan per year for subsidies. As a result, the school's funding was reduced to 1.61 million yuan per year, with an actual receipt of 134,160 yuan per month from the Ministry of Finance. However, during these 21 months, there are also some noteworthy things about the construction and equipment. These are divided into two parts:</p>
<p>A. Construction: School construction is mostly related to academic undertakings. Some people think that since the school site is planned to be moved to the suburbs, why bother adding buildings to the original site? Little do they know that the construction of the new school buildings will take at least two or three years to complete from the current planning stage. From the autumn of the 21st year (1932) to the completion of the new school buildings, it will take a total of four or five years. During these four or five years, the school's academic progress cannot be conservative or stagnant. Moreover, saving money from the regular expenses to carry out construction has not received any special subsidies from the state, which is something that academic people are willing to see. 1. Adding a Library: 221,015 yuan (including steel bookshelves worth 55,500 yuan). The original library, reading room, and book storage capacity of the school were too small. The new library has two large reading rooms, accommodating 560 people, and five branch reading rooms, accommodating 200 people, plus a combined newspaper reading room and existing branch libraries, with a total capacity of over 1,000 people, which is about four times larger than before. The book storage capacity is one and a half times larger than before.</p>
<p>2.  Building a New Music Classroom: 10,479 yuan. This was rebuilt from Mei'an and is used by the music group of the Department of Arts.</p>
<p>3.  Building a New Seed Room for the College of Agriculture: 17,266 yuan. The College of Agriculture has collected tens of thousands of varieties of various species. Without specialized buildings for storage, research is impossible.</p>
<p>4.  Building a New Greenhouse with Equipment for the College of Agriculture: 9,538 yuan. This is necessary for the research of the Departments of Agronomy and Horticulture.</p>
<p>5.  Building a New Classroom for the College of Agriculture: The Entomology Research Room, 9,785 yuan.</p>
<p>6.  Building Houses for the Department of Agricultural Chemistry, Department of Forestry, Department of Sericulture, and Agricultural Products Manufacturing Plant of the College of Agriculture, and Various Farm Buildings: 18,378 yuan.</p>
<p>Newly Built Music Room of National Central University</p>
<p>7.  Building a New School Gate: 5,355 yuan. The old school gate was demolished during the National Assembly. Because it was related to the appearance of the entire school, it had to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>8.  Building a New Science Classroom for the Experimental School: 23,100 yuan.</p>
<p>9.  Renovating the Biology Building: 13,700 yuan. The original Biology Building was too bad, severely damaged, and the basement had 23 feet of accumulated water. It had to be thoroughly renovated.</p>
<p>10. Adding New Classrooms, Factories, and a Soap Factory to the College of Engineering: 6,790 yuan.</p>
<p>11. Renovating and Adding Classrooms and Laboratories to the College of Education (Nanjing Higher Normal School): 14,530 yuan. This is the oldest building in the school and must be thoroughly renovated. However, the clock tower was not repaired due to concerns about involving other departments.</p>
<p>12. Renovating the College of Law (Southeast Gate): 7,700 yuan.</p>
<p>13. Renovating the Teaching Staff Quarters: 5,785 yuan. This is also one of the earliest buildings in the school, dilapidated and in need of repair.</p>
<p>14. Renovating the New Student Dormitory: 4,739 yuan. Although this building was built in the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), the foundation and materials were very bad and had to be repaired.</p>
<p>This is just a list of the larger and more expensive items, which amounts to 368,160 yuan. There are other smaller buildings and construction projects that cannot be listed one by one, totaling approximately 66,849 yuan. As for the payment of the completed auditorium and the purchase of seating, 14,455 yuan has also been paid. Therefore, the total amount paid for construction in these two years is 449,464 yuan. In addition, there are two new student dormitories under construction, with a contract price of 70,000 yuan, which are expected to be completed by the end of August. After completion, the student dormitories can be reorganized, which will greatly benefit the academic atmosphere. This money is taken from the deposit and rent of the original leased dormitory and is not included here for the time being. All major construction projects are overseen by the Engineering Committee, which is composed of professors, to ensure public decision-making and perfection.</p>

<h3 id="e182">The Scented Mists of the Imperial Incense <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Of course, no matter how good the Empress Dowager's appetite was, she would never eat all of them at once, not even taste them all! On average, she tasted no more than three or four dishes per meal. The rest were either discarded or taken by the female officials, palace maids, and upper-level eunuchs in turn.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager always sat alone and enjoyed her meals alone. However, sometimes she would teach me to accompany her. But I could only eat standing, not sitting like her. Her dining table was not a whole table. In fact, there could not be such a large table that could hold a full hundred bowls of dishes. Even if there was, it would be too clumsy, and the Empress Dowager would never like it! So we had a set of small tables prepared, and when they were put together temporarily, they were just enough to hold the hundred main dishes. Although the table problem was solved in this way! However, the dishes were really too far away from the Empress Dowager. Apart from the few dishes close to her, she could not reach them with her chopsticks and spoon. Then, did the Empress Dowager really have to look at these dishes but not be able to reach them? No, no, readers do not need to worry about her. It turns out that there was a eunuch next to her who was specially serving the Empress Dowager! This eunuch's name was Zhang De. After the Empress Dowager Cixi passed away, this person succeeded Li Lianying as the chief eunuch in the Qing Palace. If the Empress Dowager liked a certain dish and wanted to try it, she would order Zhang De to respectfully bring it closer and ask the Empress Dowager to take a bite. However, this errand of serving dishes was really not easy. Every hand gesture and every step had to be very solemn. After the Empress Dowager finished her meal, all the dishes would be taken away and we could eat them freely. Ninety percent of them were still completely intact, like sacrificial dishes taken down when worshiping ancestors. (65)</p>
<h3 id="e183">Short Biography of San Yu <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Jiu</p>
<p>San Yu was a school worker in a certain middle school in Zhejiang. We were colleagues for two years. The so-called "colleagues" is not intended to be respectful, because school workers are also the main figures in the school and should be in an equal position with the principal, faculty, staff and students.</p>
<p>San Yu had a strong body, iron-like wrists, and a pair of hairy legs. He was in charge of the "comprador" in the school and never failed. The school was located in a remote seaside area, about seven or eight miles away from the nearest bustling town. In order to send correspondence to the post office and purchase various supplies, it was natural that the school had to select a suitable person to serve as this "comprador". San Yu went in the morning and returned at noon; he had to go out again in the afternoon and returned at dusk. Therefore, the distance he traveled every day was always more than thirty miles, and he braved the wind and rain, without interruption in the cold and heat.</p>
<p>Although he was illiterate, he never made mistakes. If you asked him to bring something, as long as you explained it to him, he would handle it to your satisfaction. Sometimes he felt that a certain item was expensive and would discuss it with us, so that we would not suffer a loss. Sometimes he accidentally returned one copper plate less, and I had already forgotten it, but he would still find it and return it, refusing to grease his palms.</p>
<p>Whenever he carried a heavy load on a pole, shouting "Hang Yu, Hang Yu," and walked into the school gate, everyone in the school would see him and say, "San Yu. Are you back?"</p>
<p>One summer, I took a steamer back to my hometown. When the steamer was about to set sail, San Yu gave me two packs of snacks for the road and said "Bon voyage" before leaving. I still remember it today. Although these snacks were very coarse, his kindness was truly appreciated.</p>
<p>"If you lose the rites, seek them in the wild." We all called San Yu honest and took a photo with him to keep as a souvenir.</p>
<h3 id="e184">After Returning to Shanghai <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Hong</p>
<p>After six years of being away from Shanghai, fate finally drove me to see it again. Some of my friends have hung up their lawyer's signs; some have hung up their accountant's signs; and even a few are going in and out of cars and living in foreign houses. However, there are also a few who are unfortunately living a hard life; they are almost short of food and clothing, and they have a home but cannot return. Because the environment has changed, everything is somewhat different from before, but I have not changed the habit of taking two newspapers in and out of the office every morning and evening.</p>
<p>Before returning to Shanghai, in my hometown, I was very worried about Shanghai. After coming, I felt that it was nothing special, not worth mentioning. After being caged in a very tall house with teak floors for nine hours every day, when the sun sets, I have to move my body to the wide road and walk around. I took the newspaper and ran to the bustling and crowded places, wanting to grab some of the impressions that Shanghai gave me six years ago. But I was finally disappointed. Shanghai, which has progressed very quickly, is very different from before: many houses have been rebuilt, the neon lights shine everywhere, and even the street hawkers are not the same batch as before.</p>
<p>Stepping into the playground, dance hall, or song and dance, is also something that did not exist before. There are more stalls selling 15% discount books, the display of scientific psychic diagrams, and the decoration of Oriental toys. Although there are those who file lawsuits and ask for copper coins, as before, the only one I recognize is the female beggar with some pockmarks on her face and blurred eyes. Her thin, yellow face is still the same as before, and there does not seem to be a trace of change. Perhaps because her eyes are blurred and she cannot see all the changes, she herself has not changed for me to see. I often see her, often think this way, and often forget to give her a copper coin.</p>
<p>When I walk back from the road or come out of the playground, passing in front of the dance hall or the big theater, there are often pairs of young men and women crowding into the car, with slight smiles on their faces. Time steals away in the laughter I see every night. Counting on my fingers, it has been two months since I returned to Shanghai, and a layer of black light has been added to the front of a light blue long shirt from carrying newspapers.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Chen Taoist <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Tong Chu</p>
<p>Who knows that a madman is particularly popular, and his business is particularly prosperous. When people have incurable diseases, they excitedly shout: "We must invite Chen Taoist to perform a ritual, chant a few scriptures, or we won't be able to hold on!"</p>
<p>Generally, people only know that his surname is Chen, and no one knows his name; because he exorcises ghosts and demons for sick families, "Chen Taoist" has become his great name. He is a popular person in my hometown, everyone respects him, loves him, and everyone has a warning in their heart: "If I get sick, he is the only one who can save me."</p>
<p>The reason why he became famous is well-known. One summer, Wang Yuanqiao's son suffered a strange illness. The doctors all refused, and the witches said ghosts and monsters, said gods and Tao, said that Yama could only save his son and no other method would work. At this time, Chen Taoist volunteered and said loudly: "As long as I chant a scripture, the illness will turn around immediately." Everyone knew that he was a madman, so how could Yuanqiao believe him. Later, in vague hopes, he allowed him to try. Strangely enough! The illness did turn around and gradually got better.</p>
<p>"Ah, Chen Taoist has great skills! I'm afraid he is a star sent down by Zhang Tianshi!"</p>
<p>Chen Taoist's hands are always trembling. When walking, he walks with bowlegs, and raises his arms, staggering, looking like he is dozing off from a distance. He has never spoken a clear sentence. Saliva often hangs from the corner of his mouth, especially when eating or standing and looking at women, but women do not avoid him because of this, but instead give him a flirty look, and everyone laughs: "Ah! That Chen Taoist!"</p>

<p>— A Ping</p>
<p>Holding hands, with hearts aligned, like a following shot in a movie, they walked along this quiet path, treading on the fragmented shadows of the trees. The early summer breeze caressed their hair and light clothing, while also causing the shadows on the ground to sway. Silently, they occasionally exchanged glances and smiled. They cherished this precious meeting, but neither wanted to pour out the words long held in their hearts. In the exchange of glances, they seemed to understand each other more clearly than with words.</p>
<p>Their footsteps gradually slowed. She glanced at him, and he smiled, readjusted his pace, and walked forward. "We've reached the new bridge. Isn't it getting late?" She gazed at the bridge's reflection on the river, illuminated by the setting sun, reminding him as if speaking to herself.</p>
<p>"Let's watch the sunset. We can take a car back later."</p>
<p>They continued to walk forward, stepping on the shadows of the trees on the path.</p>
<p>They arrived at the bridge. They sat side-by-side on the stone railing, their gazes cast far into the distance, as if appreciating the afterglow of the setting sun, wasting one minute, two minutes, five minutes.</p>
<p>"Isn't it getting late? What about all the things you wanted to say?" She stood up, smoothed out the wrinkles in her clothes, and asked with a seemingly natural smile.</p>
<p>"There are really too many things. I don't know where to begin."</p>
<p>"Then speak. It's getting late!"</p>
<p>"Actually, isn't it better not to say anything?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I understand what you mean, but life is too dull!"</p>
<p>He turned his head and gazed at her tearful face. She looked away. "X, that doesn't sound like something a child would say?" He suddenly grabbed her arms.</p>
<p>"Do you still think I'm a child?" Her head lowered, and she sobbed.</p>
<p>"Quick, don't be like this, X," he lifted her head and said, "Listen to me. You're still young. Don't let your environment misguide your life. Besides, a child shouldn't be so pessimistic!"</p>
<p>"I understand what you mean." She nodded slightly, a crystalline teardrop rolling from the corner of her pursed lips onto his knee.</p>
<p>"Let's go back. It's really getting late." (The sun had completely sunk into the heart of the river.) He helped her up and said softly near her temples, "You have to listen to me. It was wrong of me to hurt you by not writing. Think about happy things. You haven't reached the age where life is too dull."</p>
<p>"You still treat me like a child!" Tears welled up in her eyes, and her lower lip trembled.</p>
<p>"Don't misunderstand me! I'm not saying a child who doesn't understand 'life,' but that you don't need to understand the reasoning of 'life is too dull,' right? We're both young!"</p>
<p>Slowly, they walked back along the path. The early summer breeze caressed their hair and clothing. Gentle footsteps glided by, leaving behind a blur of tree shadows on the path. Gradually, the two figures disappeared into the whisper of the dusk.</p>

<p>Chapter 30: Watching Grieving Wild Geese, Guarding the Homeland with Heads Bowed; Bullet Piercing Strong Arm, Blood Staining the Lonely City</p>
<p>Just as there was a shot near the first trench, Yin Deren moved the rifle bolt and fired dozens of shots in that direction. Following this gunfire, there was a response from the other side, shooting directly at where Yin Deren was standing. Yin Deren shouted, "One thousand meters, fire!" The brothers followed his command and fired their guns. However, Yin Deren felt a sense of depression and discomfort from being transferred in from outside the fort. At this moment, with the firing, he felt that only by killing more people could he feel relieved. Therefore, he moved the machine gun, half-crouched, not running at the embankment opening, but only aiming at the area with the most enemy gunfire, and fired from the embankment opening. He sometimes went from east to west, and sometimes from west back to east, like a madman, shouting, "Brothers, hold your breath, see the enemy clearly and fire!" As he shouted, the enemy's small bronze cannon began to bombard the city embankment. A shell hit, blowing away two or three sections of the embankment opening. Yin Deren became even more anxious and placed the machine gun on the side of the gap, firing a burst. The enemy was preparing to rush over from here, and were met with this burst of fire, causing many to fall. He forgot himself and waved his right hand in the air, saying, "Little ones, come on!" Just at this moment, he felt half of his body go numb, and he was hit in the arm. Immediately, his hands became somewhat unresponsive. Only then did he lean against the embankment wall and sit down, holding the wound on his right arm with his left hand. When he touched his arm, he felt that his palm was sticky, and he was bleeding a lot. It seemed that the bullet had passed through his arm. However, he did not let the brothers know, and continued to shout, "One thousand five hundred meters, fire!" Then he lifted a corner of his clothes, held it in his mouth, pulled out his bayonet, and cut off a long piece of the hem. He used it as a bandage, slightly bent his arm, bit one end of the cloth, and with his left hand holding the cloth, wrapped it tightly around the wound on his arm, first stopping the bleeding, and then calming down.

<h3 id="e188">Concerning the "Radio Treasure Detector" <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yunjun</p>
<p>On the ninth of this month, this publication carried an article on the "Radio Treasure Detector." I had done this myself in the winter before last, because the Radio Craft June 1932 magazine had a very detailed explanation, and its principle was feasible, so I spent more than sixty yuan at that time to buy light bulbs and other parts. After assembling it according to the instructions, the effectiveness of the two devices was still good, so I installed them in my family's ancestral hall in the inland, with the angle adjusted. Another person buried iron objects in an oil can underground, about two feet deep, in advance. Then I used this device to search. First, I held the device high, two or three feet above the ground, and sure enough, there was no sound. When I placed it about one foot above the ground, a sharp sound suddenly arose, deafening. I thought the experiment was a success and was very happy, but when I dug it up, there was nothing. I felt very strange. Later, I tested it on various ground surfaces and it could make a sound in the same way, completely indistinguishable. Only then did I realize that it had failed. But there is one point: whether it is because the device is too sensitive, or because the soil is too damp, I have not yet thoroughly researched. However, in this time of economic decline, I am afraid that someone will rashly experiment. It will end up with "trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice." So I wrote down what I have learned from my experience for everyone's reference. (No payment)</p>
<h3 id="e189">Coordination Method of Remote-Control Sound Transmission Line <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>Broadcast stations, public lecture halls, and theaters often separate the sound receiving point from the sound output point, using a transmission line to transport the received sound waves to another location. After being amplified by an amplifier, the sound is output. This type of device is called the remote-control transmission method. This method, in addition to avoiding interference between sound receiving and sound output, allows the sound receiving room and the sound output room to be set up in appropriate locations. For example, due to the location of the antenna, broadcast stations cannot be located in bustling urban areas, which is inconvenient for broadcasters to travel to and from. Therefore, it is advisable to place the sound receiving room in a location with convenient transportation, and the received sound waves are then input to the broadcasting station via a transmission line. However, when sound waves are transmitted, because the transmission line is very long, there is inductance and capacitance between the two lines. Therefore, if directly connected to the amplification stage, in addition to the sound quality and volume being greatly inferior to the original source, there will also be problems such as tremolo and noise. The solution is to add appropriate coordination to the transmission line before connecting it to the amplification stage.</p>
<p>Diagram 1 shows the coordination method of a remote-control sound transmission red line. T1 is a transmission line transformer, T2 is a microphone transformer, R1 is a 226-ohm resistor, R2 is a 74-ohm resistor, and R3 is a 67-ohm resistor. The characteristic impedance between the transmission lines is 500 ohms. A shield should be used between the transmission transformer and the microphone transformer, and the transmission line should also be shielded with a lead pipe to eliminate static electricity and other interference. The sound source is input to the T1 transformer from a microphone or pickup, and then transmitted to another location via the transmission line. After being matched by an H-shaped resistance balancer, it goes directly to the first stage of the T2 microphone transformer and the amplifier. This method has been used by several broadcasting stations and public lecture halls in the United States, as well as amateur radio stations, and the results are said to be very good. I am introducing it here for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e190">A Two-Tube Radio That Does Not Need A Transformer For AC or DC Power <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>An excellent and perfect radio does not only rely on strong power and complex circuitry. Even an ordinary small-scale radio, if designed carefully and manufactured legally, can still achieve amazing results. Recently, a type of transformerless radio sold on the market has been quite popular among the general public, likely because of its exquisite manufacturing and low price.</p>
<p>Recently, in my spare time, I tried to make a two-tube transformerless radio, using a new-style 25Z5 as a half-wave rectifier (so it can be used for both AC and DC), and an E138 pentode car tube for detection. The amazing effectiveness is not inferior to 47 or 2A5, etc. And this machine is economical, simple, beautiful, and compact, which is superior to those using transformers, and DC power can also be used, so it is quite suitable for use in the mainland with DC power plants. Based on the above advantages, this small-power radio can be made</p>
<p>, to achieve a perfect state. Amateur enthusiasts, why not give it a try? The circuit diagram is published below:</p>
<p>The coil used in this machine, in order to make it take up less space, needs to be wound on a plastic tube. L can be wound with 30 gauge wire for fifteen turns on a plastic tube with a radius of one and a half inches, with a spacing of about two-tenths of an inch. Then use the same gauge wire to wind L1 eighty turns. L2 can be wound on a one-inch diameter tube for about forty turns. When installing, if you can arrange it compactly, you can put it in a small box to make a pocket radio, which is also possible. Also, because the sensitivity is quite high, if it is used as a travel radio and does not use a sky or earth line, according to the test, you can also receive very clear music. Finally, it is important to note that the primary coil L cannot be connected to the secondary coil L1, otherwise it will easily cause danger. In addition, the capacities of other components are noted in detail on the diagram, so there is no need to repeat them.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Wiring Summary <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhiban</p>
<p>The wiring method of a radio receiver seems simple at first, but its importance is no less than the quality of the circuit and components. When beginners make their own radios, they often overlook this point, and the results are often not good, and even damage the components. All amateur researchers should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(1) Component Arrangement: The first step in wiring is</p>
<p>arranging components. Proper arrangement saves space, shortens wiring, avoids useless inductive effects, and maximizes the effectiveness of the radio. The key points of the arrangement, in terms of DC radios, for the sake of economy, if metal chassis panels and shields are not used, it is best to have a wider space. It is best to arrange the lamp sockets in a single row, with the filaments facing the panel, which can shorten the wiring a lot. The audio frequency transformer can be placed between the two lamp sockets. If there are more than two, they should be arranged at right angles and should be far away from the tuning coil. It is best to also be at right angles. The radio frequency amplification tube should be far away from the detection tube, and its tuning coil should be far away from the one used in the detection stage and at right angles. As for AC machines, the above points should also be noted. However, AC machines often use metal isolation, and complex</p>
<p>use multiple bypass capacitors and chokes. Therefore, although the arrangement is small, inductive effects can be avoided. However, power transformers and filters should all be far away from radio frequency or intermediate frequency circuits. The shield used for the coil should be twice the diameter of the coil. The distance between the coil and the bottom plate and the top of the shield is one inch each. Otherwise, the effectiveness will be poor. At the same time, attention should also be paid to the arrangement of easily heated parts, such as rectifier tubes, high-power output tubes, and power transformers. Be sure to dissipate heat quickly and avoid damaging other components. This is the general idea of component arrangement.</p>
<p>(2) Wiring Procedures: (A) All wiring must be well insulated. Bare wires can only be used in very simple circuits. The commonly used conductors are preferably 18 gauge varnished yarn covered. In high-end shortwave machines, 14 gauge varnished yarn covered is mostly used. Since the filament current of AC machines is quite large, very thick stranded wires must be used to connect the filaments. The wiring of the tetrode copper cap should also use thick and reliable insulation, because it is often pulled and easily damaged. (B) The DC machine wiring should be neat. The bends of the wire should be at right angles, and the varnish coating on the wire should not be damaged. The method is to use a piece of foreign paper to pad in the needle-nosed pliers and bend it. All wire joints should be bent into question mark (?) shapes and tightly screwed onto the screws. It is best not to use pliers for the screw caps, but to use a screw cap socket to turn them to avoid damage. (C) AC machine wiring should be straightforward, so it is intricate and complex. The wires often touch each other, and the voltage is high, so attention must be paid to the insulation of the wires. DC machines are best to be soldered, while AC machines must be soldered, because components such as fixed resistors and fixed capacitors, etc.</p>
<p>If not soldered, there is no way to make them contact firmly. (D) Wiring should be orderly and step by step to avoid errors. The general wiring method is to first connect the filaments, then the screen circuit. Grid circuit, screen grid circuit, sky and earth line circuit. Those with less experience should use a graded wiring method. First, follow the above order to install the detection stage, and try listening to be satisfied, and then add the audio frequency amplification stage, and then try listening to be satisfied, and finally add radio frequency amplification. If it is installed like this, it is easiest to succeed. (E) It is best to use five-color wires for wiring, which is not only beautiful, but also easy to check and not easy to make mistakes. It is also a necessary condition for a high-end radio. For one application, the filament uses black (一), the screen circuit uses red, to indicate high voltage. The grid circuit uses yellow. The screen grid circuit uses green. (3) Small Key Points: The following key points must not be ignored, otherwise, the result will disappoint you. (A) Before installing the components, check them carefully. (B) For all components that should be insulated from the metal plate, ensure that the degree of insulation is very reliable. (C) When installing a variable capacitor, first fully rotate the movable plate to avoid damage. (D) For fixed resistors and tubular capacitors used in AC machines, it is best to first roughly assemble several related ones. Use a small square of thick paper that has been boiled in wax to connect them to each other on both sides of the paper, so that the wiring is short, the space is small, and it will not be messy and twisted. This type of connection is used in all imported products. (E) The wires used for wiring must be matched in length, bent, and cut. It is better to be slightly longer than too short, too short is a waste. (F) The grid circuit and screen circuit wiring of DC machines should not be close or parallel, otherwise inductive effects will easily occur.</p>
<p>In short, the wiring work is very important, and even small details should not be ignored. Only then can there be achievements. Amateur researchers should pay attention to this!</p>

<p>The radio repair department of Yada Company at 24 Nanjing Road has recently become more crowded with repair work. Although most of the repaired parts are from Shanghai, the number of parts sent directly from other ports or transferred from electrical materials stores has also increased. It is said that radio listeners in the mainland often suffer from the lack of suitable repair places when their radios are damaged. Therefore, recently, people from Nanchang, Hankou, and various ports in Beijing and Hangzhou have often brought their radios specifically to Shanghai to have them repaired by the company. In view of the high travel expenses in Shanghai and the difficulty of living in Chang'an, Yada Company always rushes to repair the parts sent from other ports as soon as possible, completing them in one or two days, in order to show preferential treatment and comfort the hard work of the travelers.</p>

<h3 id="e193">About Mass Language <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Yuzhi</p>
<p>In our society, a certain social stratum that has been in a dominant position for thousands of years is visibly declining rapidly. Following the decline of this social stratum, all cultures that represent this social stratum—philosophy, morality, education, law, love, literature, and art—are also in the process of decline. The language representing the consciousness of this social stratum is naturally no exception.</p>
<p>If the May Fourth Movement did not make much contribution in other aspects, at least in the language revolution, it has already knocked down the dominant class's camp to a scattered mess. Although the leaders of the May Fourth Literary Revolution did not clearly recognize the social mission, they, on the one hand, actually sentenced "Classical Chinese" to death, unconsciously disarming the words of the dominant class. On the other hand, due to the large amount of practical application of "Vernacular Chinese," literature is no longer a forbidden place for the public. Therefore, for the decline of the dominant class's language and the generation of mass language, the May Fourth Movement did play a considerable role in promotion.</p>
<p>But this declining social stratum is definitely not willing to decline without any resistance. The language representing this social stratum, like all the cultures representing this social stratum, will inevitably resurrect from the ashes when it reaches a considerable time. Moreover, the May Fourth Literary Revolution originally did not do it thoroughly. It only opposed "Classical Chinese" and "Vernacular Chinese," and did a little bit of work on the point that literature approaches spoken language, but lightly let go of the main root of the Chinese character—representing ancient feudal consciousness—and at the same time lacked effort in the construction of the new mass language. Therefore, it left a way out for this old Chinese language that was sentenced to death in secret.</p>
<p>Sure enough, at present, following the political and social restoration tendency, the ghosts of the old Chinese language have reappeared. These ghosts show up in four different forms: the first kind maintains its original face, which is the so-called "Classical Chinese Revival" movement recently. The second kind is wearing the coat of "Vernacular Chinese" to return from the dead. (For example, the articles of the Saturday School and Zhang Henshui's novels all use the form of "Vernacular Chinese" to express the consciousness of the declining social stratum.) The third kind is mixed in the middle of "Vernacular Chinese," such as many popular works, inevitably reveal the fox tail of the declining language in form and consciousness from time to time. (Mr. Le Sibing is the most loyal to "Vernacular." But unfortunately, an article of less than a thousand words by Mr. Le published in yesterday's Free Talk has two classics: "The bell ringer automatically untied the bell, since Zeng below::" This is just an example. Mr. Le is like this, and "since Zeng below" naturally goes without saying. It can be seen that dead words are doing tricks everywhere.) The fourth kind is appearing wearing the masks of "style," "spirit," and "quotation style." Although this kind of ghost is the most well-behaved, its main function is to tend to the restoration of the language, which is very obvious.</p>
<p>These four kinds of ghosts, united together, are superficially terrible. But in practice, these are just the struggles of the declining language before and after. No matter how they struggle, they cannot save the fate of decline, because the social stratum using this language tool is declining, and the consciousness of this social stratum is also declining every day. Therefore, despite advocating "Classical Chinese" in education, the consciousness contained in "Classical Chinese" is eliminated, and the higher the "Classical Chinese," the more incomprehensible it becomes. As for the Saturday School's return from the dead, it does not have much impact after all. Those who advocate spiritual literature or quotation styles will eventually reveal their original shape.</p>
<p>Healthy people are not afraid of ghosts. The declining language of the declining class will not have much future. The main issue lying in front of us is not to oppose "Classical Chinese" or "quotation style," etc., but to actively improve the construction of mass language tools and build language for mass application that represents mass consciousness.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that the mass language proposed by Mr. Chen Zizhan and Chen Wangdao has an important meaning. However, I have some opinions here that are not completely consistent with the two Mr. Chens. I think:</p>
<p>(1) "Mass language" should be interpreted as "language representing mass consciousness." The difference between "mass language" and "Vernacular Chinese" in the May Fourth era is that "Vernacular Chinese" does not necessarily represent mass consciousness. And mass language must not allow the declining social consciousness to enter the city gate.</p>
<p>(2) "Mass language" must be close to spoken language. But the absolute "unity of writing and speech" should be when the organization of speech has made considerable progress.</p>
<p>(3) The ideal tool for Chinese language to become universally used must be to abandon hieroglyphs and become</p>
<p>phonetic characters. Therefore, at present, writing words together, stroke-reducing characters, and Mandarin phonetics are all worth promoting, because this is a step towards promoting the phoneticization and massification of Chinese language.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Thoughts After a Business College Performance (Part 2) <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— By Wei</p>
<p>Is such a script really worth our Chinese youth, living in these turbulent times, spending so much effort rehearsing and performing, to realize the beauty of this script's stage techniques? How is it different from wasting time, like women who are idle and have nothing to do, perming their hair, wearing high heels, dragging long cheongsams on the ground, making them walk with swaying waists and showing off their swaying buttocks?</p>
<p>Of course, it also shows the cruelty of war. But, I think it says too little on this point.</p>
<p>As for this performance, the first thing I want to say is: I admire the spirit of the Business College students! It is admirable to perform such a heavy three-act play with only four people. Their hard work and effort are worth admiring.</p>
<p>Ms. Hu Mingxian, who played Zhenle, performed the best. As soon as she appeared on stage, her demeanor, actions, spirit, and facial expressions attracted me like a magnet, making me happy and tense. She played the role of a leisurely, calm, and gentle young woman very well, with a good, clever tone, especially her expressive eyes. It's just that her walking was not very natural, and later she did not perform as well as at the beginning. Originally, the role she played was very difficult to please, but she played it so movingly, which shows her talent for performance. Mr. Man Qiqiang, who played the father, had bright, expressive eyes and mouth, and was very capable of acting. He played the old father Maifu very hard. Mr. Zhou Huaijiu, who played Antre, did not do enough in many places. For example, when he first appeared on stage and saw his beloved wife after four years of separation, how ecstatic and nervous should he have been? But he didn't do it. He didn't reach the above-average level in any place that required tenderness, tension, depth, passion, or boredom. Only in the fierce places and the husband's attitude did he perform decently. Finally, I want to talk about Ms. Shi Jiyun, who played the heroine. This performance could not be as lively and vivid as the script, and subtly displayed to the audience. I think Ms. Shi's inability to perform is largely to blame. She can only smile. She can pass in expressing happy places, she can barely express simple places, but she simply cannot express sad places. She does not have the passion of a tragic protagonist. She does not feel how much passion a tragic protagonist needs to handle tragic plots, how much grandeur is needed to portray tragic emotions, and how much surging emotions are needed to convey the godlike expression that makes the audience both cry and laugh. In short, she is not a talent for acting in tragedies, and even the natural and lively places are not enough, and many gentle and charming places are also ignored. At first, when Antre returned home, she did not embrace him ecstatically, nervously, and passionately; she failed to throw herself into his arms several times; and her loud crying was also unnatural. When she read the letter from the American officer asking her to leave with him at the end of the second act, she had no expressions of surprise, secret joy, or sadness, which was also a big failure. Before the end of the third act, Le Langshi's performance of walking from the closet to the stove in despair was also unnatural. When she swayed to Antre and cried out, "Ah, this room, this stove, these things that we are used to: Ah, Antre!" At this time, how heartbroken and desperate should her expression be, crying madly and then laughing madly, with her voice and body trembling? Only in this way can she move people. However, the director did not grasp these important key points, so she did not achieve these things. It's a pity!</p>
<p>In short, the director did not ask the actors to show their courage in the tense parts of the whole play. In short, this public performance was generally acceptable, and the actors are all promising, as long as they are willing to work hard.</p>
<p>The stage lighting was not good, and the third act was too dark.</p>
<p>There were also omissions in the costumes. In such a winter, Zhenle was wearing a yellow gauze dress, and when Le Langshi's friends came, they were always wearing that thin single coat, and always wearing white shoes. Since they cried bitterly several times, they didn't even take out a handkerchief. These are small details that should also be noted. Some of the dialogues are in classical Chinese, dialects, and sentences that are not suitable for the stage. This is because of the translator's writing, and some of the terms are not dramatic. But the actors and directors should change it into very clear and common words.</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Scenery of Guilin <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Reality is never as flawless as the illusory realm of ideals. I think anyone with a little experience would agree with this! This is not just my own old-fashioned opinion.</p>
<p>No matter how much scholars and men of letters use their flowery writing or eloquent tongues to promote the scenery of some places as being wonderfully like a fairyland, or to describe them as a peach blossom paradise, there is always the regret that "the reality is difficult to match the reputation." Therefore, when people mention "Guilin" and immediately have the illusion of "the best scenery in the world," I deeply feel disappointed for them!</p>
<p>Of course, Guilin has its own unique beauty; however, it is a beauty of stillness, and its era has long become a historical relic. Because it is still a medieval city, the people who live there, no matter what their occupations are, always appear leisurely and relaxed, unhurried in our eyes. There is no need to doubt that the world-famous scenery surrounding Guilin City is certainly as still as an ancient painting. No matter how much these landscapes are full of "natural beauty," as long as people are used to urban life, or even tired of urban life, they will inevitably have a sense of detachment! And the scenery of Guilin can all be painted; but as long as you live there for ten days or half a month, you will gradually feel that you are in the desert, and you will inevitably hum, "If this goes on, will I die of thirst?" So the scenery also has a sense of era!</p>
<p>So, what is the scenery of Guilin after all?</p>
<p>Let's talk about the mountains first!</p>
<p>The mountains in the Guilin area are mostly rocky and craggy, with towering cliffs and strange peaks, looking like they are artificially built. Although the mountains are bare, the color is actually verdant. There is Duxiu Peak in the city, behind the old imperial city. The mountain is more than ten feet high. Climbing up the steps, the city and fields are clearly visible. It is a pity that the pollution is very serious, and excrement and urine are all over the top of the mountain, so Duxiu Peak has turned into a unique stink. Guishan Mountain in the north of the city is also known as Fengdong Mountain. The mountain has a stone cave that runs through east and west. The cold wind is blowing. Even if you pass through this during the dog days of summer, you will feel that all the stuffiness has disappeared. Crossing the river, there are scenic spots such as Putuo Mountain, Crescent Mountain, and Seven Star Cave. The mountains all have caves, and the greatest is Seven Star Cave. The cave is very deep, and you cannot walk during the day without lighting a candle. The rocks in the cave are protruding, the spring water is dripping, and the atmosphere is gloomy and cold, with a ghostly aura; the cave is more than two miles long, running through north and south. However, there is a cave that is said to reach Hengyang, Hunan. Although this is the nonsense of those guides, it shows the depth of this cave. There is Elephant Trunk Hill in the south of the city, on the bank of the Li River, and the shape is very similar, especially its nose. In short, the mountains of Guilin are almost all volcanic rock mountains. The mountains must have caves, and they constitute various landscapes. In my opinion, they are unique, but there is absolutely no sense of greatness.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about the water of Guilin.</p>
<p>The Guijiang River, also known as the Li River, surrounds the north, east, south, and east of the city. The water is shallow and there are many shoals, and there are many fine stones in the river. The water is clear and you can see the bottom. If you lean on the shore to fish, you can count the fish. The water is clear, but it does not surpass the water of all the source areas.</p>
<p>Because I stayed in Guilin for a slightly longer period of time, the beauty I felt for the so-called "world-famous" "landscape" was only like this. Other than that, I dare not promote it and make the general public who have not experienced it look forward to it with wide eyes. July 26th.</p>

<p>"When the news of Xiaoyu's execution came, I was already so ill that I didn't know anything. After I recovered and learned the news, it didn't hurt so much. I believe this was the retribution for my previous arrest of the revolutionaries. It's just that my alcohol capacity suddenly dropped from six bowls to two, my strength has also declined, and my appearance has aged. My temperament has also become confused. Sometimes I don't have any feelings in my heart, but I just want to cry inexplicably. Sometimes I remember the past completely, and I want to tell everyone I meet. Sometimes I meet Master Zhuang Si on the street, and I also grab him and tell him my story, and when I tell him about when he came to my house and bowed to me and called me Old Master, his face often turns red. Haha, Master Zhuang Si once called me Lai Tou San the Old Master!"</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he stopped, drank the half bowl of wine in his hand, picked up a peanut and chewed it for a while.</p>
<p>"Mr. Xu, it's sad to talk about such things, but I can't help but talk about it. It's more sad if I don't talk about it. Xiaoyu has been dead for more than six years, and I have told this story hundreds of times. I feel like it's not me who wants to tell this story, it's like Xiaoyu wants me to tell it. I remember everything Xiaoyu said when he was alive, and I believe it all. He told me to let his mother, and I obeyed him. I can also tell all the principles he said about the poor and the rich. Every market day, I sit under the city gate selling sweet potato vermicelli, and I tell these principles to the villagers, and they all love to listen, and they all say that my Xiaoyu is a good person. In this way, my sweet potato vermicelli business has also improved."</p>
<p>When the four or five peanuts were also finished, he took out twelve copper coins from his pocket and spread them one by one on the counter.</p>
<p>"A Ren, take the money! Goodbye, Mr. Xu. It's getting late, and I have to cook for my wife. This wife, she should be killed, she should be killed, but I see Xiaoyu's face."</p>
<p>He staggered to the street. Seeing a dog, he shouted loudly, grabbed the dog's hind legs, and threw it more than ten feet away. The people watching laughed again, and then dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Financial Market: Silver Prices Rise, Telecoms Unfavorable, Margin Falls Sharply by $7.50 <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>The gold market was sluggish yesterday due to rising silver prices, and finally, due to widespread news favoring silver, selling pressure intensified, and the market trend declined. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in Britain and the United States rose in unison. The futures silver price on the Gold and Silver Exchange rose by 1.5% to 3%, the price of raw gold in London rose by 2 pence, exchange rates were flat, American cotton rose slightly and fell more, American wheat shrank by another 3 points, stocks fell by 7.5%, and Reuters and Associated Press wires said that US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated that the Treasury Department was beginning to purchase silver with general funds. The amount and duration were kept secret to prevent speculative behavior and excessively high prices. There was also news that purchases would be stopped. This news was similar to the reported situation. The previous day, there was this telegram, which did not have much impact, because the silver market prospect would not have huge changes. However, because of the saying that silver certificates would be issued immediately, the off-market price was initially ten yuan, then retreated to within the ten yuan mark. After opening, the market was slightly sluggish because banks were heavily loading up on near-term US dollars, and the domestic market was loose and excessive, but there was not much of a decline. When it was learned that the HSBC Bank's listed prices for Britain and the United States had not changed at all, people's confidence was shaken, and demand turned to surging, breaking out of the ten yuan mark. Banks were hooking up to distant and loading up on near-term US dollars. Afterwards, the ups and downs were narrow, and they struggled around the ten yuan mark. Because banks were tying up forward US dollars, HSBC was relatively cheap, and large investors took advantage of the low prices, and the situation stabilized. The Seattle night market silver price reported an increase of 1.35, a decrease of 1.25, and no movement. The market situation in the market was even more mediocre and lacking in change. The domestic market was slightly better, and buyers were still willing to be active. At noon, the trend was stable. Later, the Seattle night market silver price was near flat and the distant price rose by 1.25. The opening was flat, and the bank's appetite was healthy. There was a time when it rose, but it retreated due to the sale of futures. Then there was news that spot goods were pouring in, breaking the ten yuan mark. Foreign telegrams said that the US Treasury Department had purchased 10.9 million ounces of silver on Tuesdays and Wednesdays of this week. The silver market had only more than 90 million ounces of surplus silver, and it was not difficult to buy it all. People were frightened, and the selling pressure was recognized. Peers were collapsing. The exchange rate in the US dollar domestic market was gradually loosening. Rumors of deterioration were spreading in the market, and the gold price was falling, but there was still a struggle. The red gold price was calculated at 1018 yuan and 9 jiao. The day's market situation will be recorded now.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 1009 yuan and 9 jiao, down 4 yuan and 3 jiao from the previous close. The opening price of goods was 9 yuan and 8 jiao. The exchange rate opened with a selling price of 1 shilling and 3 pence and 75 points for near-term British exchange, and 33 yuan and 125 points for US exchange. During the market opening, Huabi and Sumitomo both loaded up on July US dollars at 1.875, and Fuyu, Zhentai, Zhaofeng, and Chang sold futures, and it fell to 9 yuan and 1 jiao. When it was learned that HSBC's listed prices for Britain and the United States were both flat, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Qianchang, Xiangyifeng, Yongtong, Taichang, Fuyu, and others came in, and the price rose to 11 yuan. Banks were still loading up on August US dollars at 25 points. Senchang Yong sold, and it retreated to 10 yuan, but because Yuqing and Yongfuyu bought futures, it was still able to pull up. Shanghai Sumitomo came out with September US dollars at 37.5 points, and Fuxing, Yongyu, Qingyong, and others sold goods, and it fell from 0.6 jiao to 0.9 yuan and 7 jiao. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongtian, and Feng still came in. Macgalley ate October US dollars at 4.375, and September at 3.75, gradually rising to 10 yuan and 7 jiao. Senchang Yong was still selling, and there was also a supply of goods. Shanghai loaded up on September US dollars at 37.5 points, and it retreated to the 10 yuan mark again. Zhengjin loaded up on September US dollars at 37.5 points. Dadecheng, Fuyu, and Zhaofengchang still had a buying appetite. The situation was stable again, but there was a lot of hovering. The market situation in the market was mediocre, and the ups and downs were extremely narrow. Macgalley ate October US dollars at 4.375. Fuyu, Dalian, and Yuqing Yong continued to buy, and it rose to 11 yuan. However, because Fuyu suddenly came to sell, the closing price at noon was 1010 yuan and 7 jiao, and the goods were priced at 0.5 jiao.</p>
<p>The market opened later at 1010 yuan and 4 jiao, and the goods opened at 0.5 jiao. This was because the Seattle night market silver price did not move and rose by 1.25. The opening was flat, and then retreated to 0.3 jiao. Huabi ate September US dollars at 37.5 points. Fuchang, Hengyu, Wanxing, and others advanced to 1 yuan. Dadecheng, Yuqing, Yongfuyu, Yuanmao, Yongfu'an, and others all sold, and gradually retreated. However, because the bank strongly pulled up October US dollars at 4.375, Fuchang and Tongyi both advanced, and there was still a struggle. Afterwards, Tianjin was still selling, and it was said that more than 1,000 spot goods were pouring in. People's confidence suddenly weakened. Dadecheng, Daxingyong, and Yongde all sold. It was rumored that the US silver market had only more than 90 million ounces of silver left, and it was easier to buy. People's hearts were even more miserable, and the ten yuan mark was broken, falling to 8 and a half yuan. Dadecheng and Yongfengxiang came in at low prices, and it rose to the 9 yuan mark. Hengtai, Daxingyong, Yuanchang, Yongfutai, Hengyongde, and Dekang sold again to 7 and a half yuan. Macgalley pulled up October US dollars at half a yuan. Yifengyong, Hengyu, Yuanchang, Yongyu, and Qingyong bought futures, and it rebounded to 8 yuan and 6 jiao. The October US dollars at half a yuan were also difficult to sell. Daxingyong and Zhaofengchang sold again to 7 yuan and 7 jiao. HSBC ate July gold at 25 points. Fuxingyong and others bought futures, and there was a slight improvement. People's confidence continued to weaken, and the domestic market continued to harden. Zhaofengchang, Huixiang, Tongyi, Dingkang, Dadecheng, Shengda, and others competed to sell, and it fell to 6 yuan and 3 jiao. Later, Fuchang worked hard to buy, and it rose to 7 yuan. Yuanmaoyong and others sold, and the closing price was 1006 yuan and 7 jiao, and the goods were priced at 6 yuan and 3 jiao. After the market closed, Tianfeng, Dadecheng, and Zhaofengchang came to sell, but because Dalian and Fuxingyong were still advancing, the opening was half stable, and the goods were squeezed slightly. Fuyu and others sold again, and broke through 6 yuan again. It was found that the highest price during the day was 1011 yuan and a half, and the lowest price was 1006 yuan and 3 jiao, with a fluctuation of 5 yuan and 2 jiao. As a result, it fell by 7 yuan and 5 jiao from the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was calculated at 32 yuan and a half because the HSBC Bank's US dollar listing price did not move, and the combined margin price was 1064 yuan strong. According to the closing price, it was about 58 yuan weak, which was 7 yuan stronger than the previous close. July was 1011 yuan, August was 1011 yuan, the morning replenishment was 1011 yuan, the afternoon replenishment was 1007 yuan, and the red gold price was calculated at 1018 yuan and 9 jiao. The trading in the market was quiet again. Tianjin goods were about 10 yuan and a half stronger, but there was no delivery. The situation was deserted, and there were few swap transactions. Yuanshengyong paid Dadecheng 84 futures, which was 1 yuan. The bulls were still eagerly posting, and the posting price was stable. It was launched because the spot goods plus water were difficult to improve. As of today, there were still 5,845 futures left in July, with a total of 16 bulls and 14 bears.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was relatively chaotic. Fei Fang turned to surging. In summary, Wanxing, Shunli, Fuchang, Tongtai, Changchang, Shengyong, Fuxingyong, Hengchangyong, and others were on the buying side. Senchangyong, Daxingyong, Chunyuan, Yongfutai, Hengtong, Chunhong, Kangyong, Hongxing, Huixiang, Yingfeng, Hengen, Shenkang, Zhaofengchang, and others were on the selling side. Qianchangxiang, Yuqingyong, Yongde, Fuyu, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Yuanmaoyong advanced and exited later. Yifengyong, Dafa, Yongfu'an, Xianghe, and Yuanchun advanced first and then exited. Dalian and Wanxing jointly made more than 1,300 futures, rolled in more than 800 futures. Shunli jointly made more than 900 futures, rolled in more than 300 futures.

<p>Yesterday's financial market atmosphere was due to the fact that the end of the month was approaching, and the procedures for mutual transactions were urgently awaiting sorting out, so there were many settlements and deliveries. In addition, the operating settlements and deliveries were much less than in the previous days. The foreign interbank market has not changed for several days.

<p>Yesterday, the short squeeze at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was even more severe than before. Those short sellers who had no stock to deliver had no other option but to painfully cut their losses or engage in swaps. The market's strength and investor confidence showed no signs of weakening. The strong buying interest from various syndicates continued unabated, seemingly insatiable. Most bonds have broken through their highest prices from April 2nd, reaching new record highs. Consolidated salt taxes surged past the 70% mark and continued to climb. Even long-term financial bonds, which had been languishing, hit a new high of $50. Market prices advanced relentlessly, showing no signs of pullback. Major bullish investors were adding to their positions instead of selling, and any slight dips were immediately bought up. Several attempts to trigger small declines failed, as bullish momentum remained strong. Rumor had it that a certain savings society was still heavily invested. Whether those with short positions in gold would take this opportunity to cash out at high prices remained to be seen. Therefore, fierce competition between bulls and bears was expected to continue over the next two days. At the opening bell yesterday afternoon, market prices soared again, with short sellers rushing to cover their positions. Consolidated taxes jumped by over a dollar, and all other bonds also experienced rapid gains, rising across the board. Consolidated salt taxes even broke through the 70% mark. In the second session, bullish investors took the opportunity to engage in swaps, causing market prices to weaken slightly, fluctuating by as much as 30 to 40 cents. The afternoon session started late, after 5 PM, so only one session was conducted. The prices of the aforementioned bonds softened by 20 to 30 cents before rebounding from the rise in salt taxes, with short-term gold surging by 65 cents. Overall, market prices closed higher, with gains ranging from 35 cents to $1.40. The total trading volume was estimated to be around $30 million. The table below shows the results of the price changes (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>A report from the Xinfeng Foreign Firm states that yesterday (the 21st), the market at the New York Stock Exchange was quiet and mixed. Treasury Secretary Mao Zemin stated that he would do his best to implement the Silver Act, which boosted mining stocks. Although the commercial index was very good, wheat prices fluctuated due to continuous sell-offs and improved harvests. The stock market also saw more declines than gains. The small exchange was slightly lower with mixed results, and bonds were sluggish. The highly speculative railway bonds saw some profit-taking. Foreign government bonds showed mixed results, and German bonds remained scarce. The total trading volume for the day was 530,000 shares. According to an agent's report, securities trading was slow, with a lack of public interest and meaningless price fluctuations. Bullish investors continued to unload wheat, which was absorbed by various parties. A large transaction in flour was predicted. The state of maturation of corn was still uncertain, but oats, barley, and rye had already had good harvests. Regardless of whether they could mature, they would all be needed by the market. Continuous heavy rain had changed the situation, so the harvest of miscellaneous grains might be better than previously predicted. The cotton market was stable and uneventful, with slight hedging in the South being absorbed by peers and the Japanese. Industrial consumers of rubber remained in a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for the resolution of labor strikes in the eastern states and stockpiling goods to sell at high prices. The sugar market was tight, with a sharp increase in the demand for refined sugar, and people were also starting to inquire about raw sugar. However, buyers would need to offer slightly higher prices to make a deal. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market started with a rise but then fell, creating an unusually chaotic situation. Trading volume in the market increased again, and investor sentiment became erratic, causing the market to fluctuate wildly and making it difficult to predict. Although buyers showed strong interest, many investors took profits as prices rose, which limited the upward momentum. The Tianjin syndicate continued to make healthy purchases, but they were mainly buying coarse yarns like 17s, 16s, and 10s, with no demand for fine yarns.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Dramatic Fluctuations in Golden Rooster Yarn <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The marked yarn market opened higher, continuing the momentum from the previous day. A portion of cotton yarn was difficult to deliver, so buying interest remained strong. The second session saw a significant increase. In the third session, the price of Japanese third-grade yarn plummeted by $17.50, shocking the market.</p>
<p>The situation was like a sudden, violent storm. Market prices changed drastically, and sellers flooded the market. The decline was quite sharp, resulting in a drop of 1278 cents to $1.10 across all months. In the afternoon session, major investors continued to buy and add to their positions, causing a rebound of 67 cents. Subsequently, news broke that the closing price of third-grade yarn had fallen by another $8.70, a drop of $26.30 compared to the previous day's closing price. The second and third sessions weakened again. According to some sources, the Tianjin syndicate was buying coarse yarns but showed no interest in fine yarns. Furthermore, there were still available spot goods in the market, and the price of spot yarn was $1 to $2 lower than the price of marked yarn. Therefore, bullish investors sold when prices rose and bought when prices fell, preventing the market from stabilizing. However, a certain Japanese foreign firm engaged in a large-scale sell-off, creating significant downward pressure. Based on the overall situation, it was difficult to be overly bearish. The total trading volume for the day was 63,800 bales. Sales: Shenchang 1,450 bales, Chunji 1,800 bales, Dafeng 6,150 bales, Gengfeng 1,900 bales, Ruid 1,100 bales, Daji 900 bales, Minghua 1,000 bales. Purchases: Suilong 1,600 bales, Huikang 1,150 bales, Junchang 1,000 bales, Tongxing 1,400 bales, Yuanyi 1,250 bales, Yichang 1,500 bales, Changfeng 1,950 bales, Dachang 3,000 bales.

<p>Spot yarn sales in the northern market remained strong. Statistics for the day showed that various syndicates bought a total of 1,646 bales, with prices rising by 50 cents to $1.00. Purchase amounts by syndicate were as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market rose in the morning but fell in the afternoon, showing slight signs of weakness. However, speculative buyers of new cotton were quite active, and the market price of new cotton was higher than that of old cotton. Bullish companies continued to absorb large amounts of cotton and did not release it, while external cotton sales were mediocre. Therefore, fierce competition existed between bulls and bears.</p>

<p>The marked cotton market opened higher, following the trend of external cotton. At the same time, rumors circulated in the market that the National Government would increase import duties on cotton by $2 to $1 per dan, which further fueled buying interest. Middle-month contracts rose by 2-3 cents. In the second and third sessions, the market was affected by third-grade yarn and fell again. As a result, the current month rose by 2 cents, and distant months rose by 0.5 to 1.5 cents. The market remained flat in the afternoon, but prices rebounded again towards the close. Contracts for all months fell by 1-2 cents. The total trading volume for the day was 100,970 dan. Sales: Jifeng 2,100 dan, Hengda 2,700 dan, Dafeng 2,800 dan, Huikang 2,100 dan, Gengfeng 3,600 dan, Senkang 1,600 dan, Renfeng 1,200 dan, Yuanxingchang 7,700 dan, Tongxing 2,100 dan, Dachang 2,400 dan, Chunji 1,700 dan, Jinchang 1,800 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially rose due to dry weather, but then weakened as bullish positions were liquidated and New Orleans prices softened. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices fluctuated by 1 to 6 points. British cotton futures rose by one point. Indian cotton initially weakened due to the liquidation of bullish positions and speculative selling, but then strengthened as Japanese companies bought and short sellers covered their positions. As a result, Pinggar and Bai Luoxi fell by 2 robies and 2.5 quarters, and Aomula fell by 1 robie and 7.5 quarters. The original telegraphic record is on the left (May 21st telegram):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally flat and weak after the morning opening. Foreign wheat quotations in Chicago fell by 78 cents to $1, and Canadian quotations fell by 8 to 20 cents. Given the continuous decline in foreign wheat prices, spot goods should have followed suit. However, because traders were cautious and arrivals from various regions were not very strong, investor sentiment remained calm. Therefore, prices for all months remained stable, with only small changes of 1-2 cents. After the afternoon opening, the market was initially flat but then became more active as spot wheat also saw price increases, stabilizing investor sentiment. As a result, August contracts rose slightly by 2 cents, September contracts rose by 1 cent, and October contracts rose by 1 cent. The spot wheat market saw better sales at factories, and sellers raised their prices by five cents across the board. Prices were as follows: Bengbu Zhangwan Mingguang wheat at $2.95, Tai'an wheat at $2.93, Nansuzhou Yangzhou at $2.90, Jiangyuan wheat at $2.81, Guiying wheat at $2.85, Liuhe wheat at $2.82 and 7 cents, Daqiao wheat at $2.82, Nanjing wheat at $2.75-6 cents, Zhitang wheat at $2.79, Kunshan Zhitang Shuangfeng wheat at $2.75, Penglai wheat at $2.73, and Zhenjiang wheat at $2.78. A total of 12,000 bags were offered, with Fuxin buying 7,000 bags and Fufeng buying 5,000 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market was generally flat and weak in the morning, with foreign wheat quotations in Chicago falling by a significant 78 cents to $1. The highest price per bushel was around $1.06, but yesterday it was only around 89 cents. Canadian quotations fell by 8 to 20 cents. However, after the opening, investor sentiment remained stable, and prices for all months only decreased by about 0.5 to 1 cent. This was because factories were not selling off their inventory, and most of the bullish investors were from the banking syndicate, with long-term perspectives and few exits, so the market was not greatly affected. After the afternoon opening, the market was initially flat but then gradually improved. News broke that the Tianjin syndicate had bought a large quantity of spot goods, estimated at 80,000-90,000 bags, with old vehicles meeting standards, warships at 6.5 cents, artillery forts meeting standards with 3 cents less, and wheat roots at 1 cent less. As a result, investor sentiment improved, and the market saw price increases. However, trading volume was not high, with only 120,000-130,000 transactions throughout the half-day, so the market was not very active. As a result, contracts for the current month to September remained unchanged, while October contracts rose by 0.05 cents and November contracts rose by 1 cent.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the early rice market situation in this area was stagnant. The Zhejiang, Bian, Yong, and Shao syndicates were also in a wait-and-see position. Sales in inland Fuzhou also declined. This was because arrivals in the market have not been strong recently, with secondary quality rice predominating in the inventory. Importers were unable to expand their purchases to their satisfaction, and cargo owners continued to raise prices for high-quality rice, while those with secondary quality rice were willing to lower prices to sell them off early. Therefore, importers were mostly in a wait-and-see position. Yesterday, the Tongshi store sold 1,022 bags from Fuzhou, with inland purchases of 460 bags of brown rice, and northern syndicates purchased 80 bags of machine-milled yuan rice. The price of high-quality rice rose slightly, while secondary quality rice remained flat with small fluctuations.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market of foreign firms in this city saw continued robust trading in Qimen, Ningzhou and other black teas, as well as the sales of Tunxi, Xi County, and Suian green teas upon their arrival. Even the long-stagnant Plain Green Tea has seen active sales to American firms recently. The tea market's trend is fairly stable. Yesterday, the entire city traded 6,400 boxes of Plain Green Tea from local firms, along with Qimen Ningzhou and Hubei black teas. The prices of Plain Green Tea from major syndicates ranged from 49 yuan to 52 yuan and 85 cents, with no significant fluctuations compared to before, and other teas were also firm.</p>

<p>▲▲ Hai Ning Summer Silkworms Are Growing Smoothly Hai Ning is a famous silk area with silk mills, and the raw materials are supplied by local native silk firms. This year, farmers' spring silkworms failed, and most of them raised summer silkworms. The amount of silkworm eggs is smooth, the climate is warm, and the silkworm eggs are growing smoothly. The early groups have already had their third sleep and are open to leaves.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Native Silk has Arrived on the Market The spring cocoon market in the Hangshao area ended early. This year, the price of fresh cocoons is small, and the farmers' leaf capital is not cheap. They are unwilling to sell at a loss, so most of them spun native silk themselves. The new local soil silk in Hangyuan has been listed, but in recent times, the silk firms have been losing money frequently. Only a few companies such as Xieda have opened the weighing scale. There are many arrivals on the market, and the price of silk is less than 20 yuan per hundred taels.</p>
<p>▲ European Sales of Yellow and White Factory Silk are Stagnant Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this city showed more fatigue. Sales of yellow and white factory silk to Europe and the United States have completely stalled. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others took in 25 packages of dry secondary gray silk, and the price was still half fatigue.</p>

<p>— Gou Fo</p>
<p>Nothing to talk about, talk about celebrity calligraphy and paintings, doing calligraphy and painting is already boring, talking about calligraphy and painting is even more boring,</p>
<p>Whether those who can do calligraphy and painting are celebrities is originally a question, among calligraphy and painting celebrities, there are non-celebrities, there are those who are currently non-celebrities but will become celebrities in the future, there are those who will never become celebrities, whether one is a celebrity or not, the world will judge, in this equal world, for the time being, everyone is a celebrity,</p>
<p>However, in such a depressed, and extremely depressed year, what leisure and interest is there to talk about calligraphy and painting, it is really driving backwards, lacking awareness, since it has nothing to do with national economy and people's livelihood, nor is it a strategy for saving the country, playing with things and losing one's ambition, wasting energy, in the minds of clear-headed and passionate people, they will definitely shout that the country is about to perish, there must be妖孽, the country's demise is all because of this generation,</p>
<p>Not bad, if such a big topic is added to the body of calligraphy and painting celebrities, it is also reasonable, but I think about this question from midnight dream back, and there are still some inconsistencies, Japan, with its small island country, since the Meiji Restoration, in less than a few decades, jumped to become the world's top powerful country, and in its country, those who study antiques, those who study calligraphy and painting, are more thorough than us, more pursuit, as far as the European and American powers are concerned, they are also innovating in art, striving for perfection, the strength of a country has nothing to do with antiques and calligraphy and painting, the example can prove,</p>
<p>Our country is a five-thousand-year-old civilized country, and antiques, calligraphy and paintings have their considerable value, which has long been recognized by all countries, and the so-called antiques are all from new to ancient, from ancient to more ancient, the times are inherited, and antiques, calligraphy and paintings are not replaced, if there are only old-fashioned antiques, and no new-brand antiques that follow, then antiques, calligraphy and paintings, will not be extinct in the world,</p>
<p>The advantage or disadvantage of things is not in the thing but in the person, many foreign doctors who have studied abroad in our country, and old scholars who do not pay attention to ancient studies, some of them become traitors after a transformation, some of them become Han traitor merchants after a transformation, some of them become imperialist lackeys after a transformation, it cannot be said that such people are not fashionable, it cannot be said that they do not know the times,</p>
<p>Although calligraphy and painting people do not make up for the country, they also do not harm the country, and calligraphy and painting celebrities rarely have heroes whose talents cover the world, even if they do not do calligraphy and painting, they will definitely not have other great contributions to society and the country, it is better to study and study calligraphy and painting, eliminate leisure, or be displayed in the museum one day, for the Yi Peiji class, to steal and sell, may not be impossible,</p>
<p>Calligraphy and painting in our country have no research value, I dare not believe this statement, otherwise, why are foreigners so stupid, spending huge sums of money to buy calligraphy and painting in our country, what is the purpose, the depression of the national situation in our country, so even antiques, calligraphy and paintings are unlucky together, because antiques, calligraphy and paintings are unlucky, the general study of antiques, calligraphy and painting people, are also greatly unlucky, it is really wronged, conscience of heaven and earth,</p>
<p>The hundred craftsmen live in the market, so that it becomes a market, and society is formed, and the country is also like this, those with political skills can talk about politics, those with military knowledge can talk about military affairs, those with scientific and legal minds can talk about science and law, those with calligraphy and painting hobbies can talk about calligraphy and painting, if the big topic of national subjugation is completely added to the body of general calligraphy and painting celebrities, calligraphy and painting celebrities should also call out to the old ancestor of art,</p>

<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>After such good news came from the southern country in early summer, I waited every day for that accidental day to be today. Fei couldn't leave Shanghai, her second hometown, and she couldn't leave the Shanghai friends who needed her. But it made me have to think about the situation after we met, the triangle tragedy, we took great perseverance to escape from this vortex. Now that she has returned from Guangzhou after suffering all kinds of hardships, and after joining our group, I wonder what kind of situation will unfold again? She is a bold woman, or she will leave all the previous things in Guangzhou and start our new life: but women are women after all, her youth has run to the glorious end, even if she never wants to try that bitter cup of love again, a woman with no relatives, will she not think of her return? Can anyone in our group solve such a difficult problem for her? Guangzhou friends cannot comfort her, what will Shanghai friends use to comfort her? Coming to Shanghai still makes her feel greatly disappointed! Thinking of these times, I hope she will not return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, it has rained one day by chance 丨 This is really an accidental day. Jun's phone call came. He said that Fei had arrived in Shanghai. Because I moved, she couldn't find the place. She is now staying at the ×× Hotel, and asked me to go quickly after work. Although I hoped that she would not come to Shanghai again, I felt very happy when I heard the news. After leaving the office, I jumped into the rickshaw with an empty stomach and went to the designated place.</p>
<p>The car stopped at the neon lights. I remembered that we had separated here when we left. A slight sadness struck my heart. Take the elevator to the fifth floor</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>, knocked on the room Jun told me, and the first one to rush out of the door was Fei, and I was the last one to arrive among the many friends who saw her off. For a moment, it seemed like I had broken into another happy world.</p>
<p>Fei hasn't changed. Except for her slightly darker complexion and being washed by the wind of the southern country, she grabbed my arm, as if guarding against me from escaping, and looked at my face playfully and said:</p>
<p>"Ah ×, did you eat spare rib sauce (meaning being scolded by your superiors)?" Before she finished speaking, she laughed loudly as if she couldn't breathe.</p>
<p>"Fei, I'm sick!" I deliberately lowered my voice and coughed.</p>
<p>"Really?" She turned her head and swept her eyes across everyone's faces, but everyone pretended to be serious. She pulled me to sit on the sofa, patted my shoulder,</p>
<p>"Ah ×, you have worked too hard!" She couldn't continue talking, and leaned her head on the back of the sofa.</p>
<p>An unexpected burst of laughter made her raise her head in surprise. She saw me smiling slightly too, and hurriedly wiped her eyes, pushed me angrily and jumped up, took out a cigarette from the stage and smoked alone, staring at the smoke rings as if she didn't want to pay attention to anyone.</p>
<p>I dragged her out and said, "Fei, what's the matter? Don't you want to see us?" I said to everyone at the same time. "We should live happily. Our Fei has returned. Let's watch Fishing Light Song tonight. It's more interesting than drinking brandy in a ballroom!" "Is it more interesting than drinking brandy in a ballroom?" I repeated, grabbing her shoulders. Fei finally smiled, turned around and escaped my grasp, threw the cigarette butt out the window, grabbed her silver bell purse, and said, holding it high, "I'm paying!"</p>

<p>— Wenli</p>
<p>Since moving into the new house, the first deep impression I had was of the horses rented out for people to ride, tied to the bamboo fence on the wasteland at the roadside near the alley entrance. Among them, there was a female donkey mixed in with the horses, always wailing mournfully every day. The sound of its wailing made one's nerves tremble. This sound also reminded me of my life in × place the year before. There, four donkeys were used in the public kitchen to drag the millstone to grind wheat. When they were released to rest, they were tied under the willow trees and exposed to the sun until they could barely breathe, so they competed to wail at each other. I was most afraid of hearing their wailing there. Sometimes, when there was no way to avoid it, I had to cover my ears with both hands. But no matter how much you covered your ears, their wailing would always drill in and knock against your eardrums, making you feel very uncomfortable. Now, walking past the roadside every day, I was unavoidably disturbed by the donkey's wailing, which made me feel a sour and sad emotion in my heart. And this sadness was not caused by any specific object that made me feel sad, but simply because hearing its voice made me feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The donkey was a black donkey with a large patch of white hair on its back. Perhaps because it had suffered too much hardship and not eaten or drunk enough, it was so thin that you could only see its bones, and its eyes were dull and lifeless, with white fluid flowing from them. It was an old, sick donkey. Although the horses beside it were not particularly strong or magnificent, it was still a frail, sick donkey. In comparison, how aged and insignificant it was! No wonder it wailed, I thought to myself.</p>
<p>The donkey's owner, on the other hand, was a hunchbacked, short old man! Whenever he saw pedestrians passing by his side stopping to look at his donkey, he would always offer a smiling face, bow, and lean his body at a sixty-degree angle to people, saying, "Ride donkey, want to? Ride donkey, want to?" But he was often met with cold eyes, and people would silently walk on their way. Once, I was attracted by the donkey's wailing and wanted to see why it was crying so miserably. As I stopped and carefully looked at it, the old man shouted at me in a miserable voice, catching me off guard, "Ride donkey, want to?" I shifted my attention away from the donkey and turned to look at its owner. Beneath his grey hair was a withered, tired, and sallow face, with grey eyebrows, a grey beard, and grey eyes. Wrinkles etched the traces of a lifetime of hard work and sorrow on his forehead and the corners of his mouth. His expressionless, blank look, and the way he spoke as if he wanted to laugh and cry at the same time, resonated with sympathy in my heart. The iron whip of life had bent his back and turned his hair and beard grey, yet he was still struggling for survival.</p>
<p>A child wearing a primary school uniform, about eight or nine years old, was pestering his father, a gentleman in a Western suit, to ride a horse. The old man, with a smiling face – still that same expression as if he wanted to laugh and cry – said to him, "Ride donkey, want to?" His father said, "Riding a horse is too dangerous." But the child insisted on riding a horse, looking down on the donkey, saying, "It's too dirty and small, I don't want it." His father said, "The horse is too dangerous, you can't ride it, you'll fall and die." The child started to cry, "The donkey doesn't run fast, I don't want it." His father laughed loudly, "Doesn't run fast, don't want it!" The child said, "The horse runs fast, I'm not afraid – isn't that person leading it in front?" For the father to have him ride a donkey was simply the best opportunity for the old man. He quickly flattered, saying, "My donkey can run fast, faster than a horse!" Faster than a horse – this was only a way to coax a child. The gentleman laughed loudly again when he heard it, laughing at him for lying. But the child also refused to be fooled, saying fiercely to the old man, "Don't I know? Horses are faster than donkeys! Daddy, I want to ride a horse." Not knowing whether the gentleman thought the old man was not being honest, or whether he cherished his son, he listened to the child and was dragged to a large horse. The old man was disappointed, but his expression didn't show it. He asked passers-by again, "Ride donkey, want to?" He was so used to people's indifference that no cold stimulation could move his numb heart.</p>
<p>Every time I walked past there, I always heard the donkey's wailing, which made my nerves tremble, and at the same time, I saw the old man saying to passers-by, "Ride donkey, want to?" But I never saw anyone riding his donkey. The cold indifference could not stir the old man's heart, but it touched my sensitive heart.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Starting from the Crow's Caw <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Shuihua</p>
<p>Waking up very early, the cool breeze and light mist were ruling the world. Breathing in the cool air flowing in from the window and watching the green paulownia leaves sway in the light mist, everything was quiet before me, and my heart was hazy. Somewhere hidden, little birds were chirping, and somewhere hidden, frogs were croaking. The green grassland was stretched out, lying down.</p>
<p>"Quah, quah, quah, quah," suddenly several black shadows cut through the grey sky and rushed past. A series of "quah, quah, quah, quah" sounds rained down. The black shadows had already flown far away, but the sounds had already stirred up ripples in my clear heart. Half of this was because the sound came so suddenly, and half, of course, was still the traditional subconscious effect – because this was the so-called ominous crow's caw.</p>
<p>The whirlpool of thought dispersed. I thought that believing that a crow's caw is ominous is of course a matter that has no room for discussion, but I felt that this superstition expresses people's selfishness to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Isn't this still selfishness? A crow's caw is just a crow's caw, but people don't acknowledge that it is the crow cawing itself. Instead, they want to say that the crow is cawing for some other purpose. Saying that the crow's caw has a purpose and not caring about it is one thing. The creatures that see and hear crows cawing in the sky are numerous to some extent, but people only say that their object is humans. Furthermore, there are so many people who see and hear crows cawing in the sky, but everyone feels that they are the object of the crows' caw. Why isn't the crow cawing itself but cawing for a purpose? Why isn't the object of the crow other creatures but humans? Why isn't the object of the crow someone else but myself? All of this can be said to be due only to people's selfishness with themselves as the subject.</p>
<p>Humans are truly a selfish thing. Not only is the idea of considering oneself the subject of everything in various superstitions selfish and ridiculous, but even in daily life, people are always showing how selfish they are. For example, suspicion breeds jealousy, resentment, and indignation. Which of these is not the result of selfishness? They all consider themselves the subject of everything, so they suspect others' actions,</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>whether they look down on me; they are jealous of others' success because they believe that their skills are inferior to mine; they resent others' neglect because they believe that they have treated me wrongly; and they are indignant at others' failures because they believe that they intentionally insulted me. Extending this to everything, the truly arrogant, tyrannical, and even everything dictatorial does not arise from the selfishness of considering oneself remarkable. Truly, all kinds of troubles arise from this, and all kinds of sins are accomplished by this.</p>
<p>People are truly a pitiful group of creatures!</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Boss's Face <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>The boss's face is so scary. It's always so angry, so fierce, with no place to approach him or feel any goodwill. In short, his face is like that three hundred and sixty days a year. I have never seen him open his mouth to smile. I'm really afraid to see his face, unwilling to see his face, unhappy to see his face – if it were possible.</p>
<p>I often think: the boss had better get sick, and sick badly, always lying in bed – unable to move at all. That way, he wouldn't come to the store and put on his boss's face. That way, I could sit at the counter properly, secretly looking at Xue Rengui's expedition to the east, or glancing at the little girls passing by. Otherwise, I could chat with Ah Si. Wouldn't that be great!</p>
<p>But, heaven just has to go against me. Not only doesn't the boss get sick, but his body is incredibly strong, stronger than us young guys. Not one of us can compare with him. It's us who get sick instead. That's really painful. We still have to make a living. Where would we get the money to buy medicine? That makes things even more troublesome. The boss doesn't care if you live or die. You still have to do your job well. But how can a sick person do their job well? The boss doesn't treat you like a person. He doesn't care about you. He won't forgive you. He only cares about himself, only wants to save money and make money, oppress people, and exploit people. It's really bad luck to be a shop assistant.</p>
<p>I get scolded every day, and sometimes I even get slapped. I'm really furious. Am I not a person? You, the boss, are a person, but am I, Li Jin, not born of a mother? You're just a petty boss, a petty capitalist. What are you being so fierce for? What are you being so imposing for? I'll see if you can be imposing to the end! I'm really not convinced by my boss's attitude.</p>
<p>But what's the point of not being convinced? What can I do to him? He has all the money, he's the boss, and I'm the shop assistant. So, I have to put up with his attitude. If I were the boss, I would be like that too. I would put on the boss's face. If he were my shop assistant, he would have to be at my command, listen to my orders, or else, I would tell him to get out! I would be fierce too. In short, being a boss is like that. There's nothing good to say about it. Because the boss is the boss and the shop assistant is the shop assistant. There's a river separating us.</p>
<p>Thinking about things like this, I really think it's not right, not right at all. Why does it have to be like that? Can't it be different? – The boss doesn't oppress us, and we don't resist the boss! We all make a living peacefully. Wouldn't that be good for everyone?</p>
<p>But, it can't be like that! Because the world isn't like that. If there are rich people, there will naturally be poor ghosts. If there are bosses, there will naturally be shop assistants. Everyone has a different status. So, I think we will never get along with the boss, and the boss doesn't bother to get along with us either. He has all the money, what's he afraid of? But, if we don't have work, we'll starve to death! We rely on the boss to live!</p>
<h3 id="e223">The Landlady <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Ruowang</p>
<p>The landlady is sick, no, she has a little treasure in her belly, doesn't want to eat, but wants to eat sour things, the cries of hawkers selling sugared plums make her excited, and Chen Yumei's lullaby makes her think of the taste of being a mother.</p>
<p>Her husband has a job and is not at home during the day. The landlady is alone in the room, comfortably lying on the bed. Chen Yumei's lullaby lulls the landlady to sleep.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the landlady issues one or two commands from the bed –</p>
<p>"Old man, watch the door." – The old man is her grandfather.</p>
<p>"Grand Uncle, hurry up and cook, my belly is hungry."</p>
<p>"Sister, wash my pants for me."</p>
<p>The Grand Uncle seems very apologetic, smiling as he walks to the door of the landlady's room, asking this female commander, female emperor what dishes she wants to eat. The female commander usually doesn't speak much, but when she does, it must be done. We can also understand that the money is in the landlady's hands, so nothing is impossible. But the Grand Uncle has no money. Without money, he can only swallow his pride and listen to the landlady's orders, so the Grand Uncle becomes a nephew instead.</p>
<p>In the evening, the sound of the husband's footsteps is outside the door. The landlady immediately closes her eyes tightly, pretending to be fast asleep, waiting for her husband to walk into the room and rest for a while before she wakes up from her dream. She scolds her husband in a spoiled voice for coming back so late.</p>
<p>The husband is Americanized, taking out the fruit hidden in the drawer and peeling it for the landlady to eat.</p>
<p>The old man is watching the door, the Grand Uncle is busy in the kitchen until his face is flushed, the husband is busy peeling fruit, and the landlady is busy acting spoiled. And so the sky gradually darkens.</p>
<p>"It's getting hot, cut some ×× gauze for me tomorrow to make clothes, don't forget." This command is issued to the husband, and we can imagine that the husband will certainly obey.</p>
<p>But the husband also has his own hardships. Although it is rare for him to have no money, there are always unfortunate times.</p>
<p>The next evening, the sound of the husband's footsteps is again outside the door. The landlady closes her eyes tightly, pretending not to know. As usual, the husband doesn't dare to make a noise, quietly walking around the room, seeming a little uneasy.</p>
<p>"Why did you come back so late today?"</p>
<p>The husband is peeling the skin of the fruit.</p>
<p>"Where's the fabric?"</p>
<p>The husband stuffs a mandarin orange into her mouth, but it is slapped away by the landlady, who turns her body around, facing inward. Ugh! Ugh! She's going to vomit, huh! huh! She really seems sick.</p>
<p>The husband sits on the bed and pats her back, very patiently, without saying a word. The landlady wriggles her body, not wanting him to pat her. If he pats her, it's not right, if he doesn't pat her, it's not right. There's really no way.</p>
<p>The old man's belly is growling with hunger. The Grand Uncle often walks to the door of the room and looks in. A table full of food has gone cold, but he doesn't dare to ask. And the landlady's illness is becoming increasingly serious. The stalemate continues indefinitely.</p>
<p>The old man is secretly eating fatty meat. The Grand Uncle is like a wooden puppet, without any ideas. But the landlady is leaning in her husband's arms. But how will this awkward situation end? The husband has to tell her his secret, and unexpectedly gains the landlady's favor.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you say so earlier? If you don't have money, I have it here. You didn't even know how to tell the color of the fabric. Come on, let's go buy it together." The landlady's fussiness seems to have disappeared. Yes, she didn't really have any illness.</p>
<p>Finally, the landlady went out with her husband.</p>
<p>On the way back, the landlady has a package of fabric in her hand and whispers in her husband's ear in a sparsely populated place, "Let's stay outside tonight, just like when we weren't married." The husband agreed, but the old man is guarding the door, still sitting there late into the night.</p>
<h3 id="e224">The Problem of Housing <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Weifeng</p>
<p>Clothing, food, and housing are the three major problems. In Shanghai, housing is the most difficult to solve. A salaried employee often has a large portion of their income taken up by housing. And within a room that is less than a few square feet, the bedroom, kitchen, and toilet are all squeezed in, calling it a pigeon coop, which is very appropriate. If a person without permanent assets suddenly loses their job, it is truly unimaginable! Shanghai is a place where every inch of land is worth gold. Half of this is due to the manipulation of real estate brokers, and half is due to the large number of people crowding into the city after bankruptcy in the countryside. As a result, places that were once deserted are now tall buildings and mansions. The increasing prosperity of the city also means the increasing exploitation of the petty bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>A salaried employee sometimes has to consider the distance to their workplace and the cost of transportation. Their home often has to be moved frequently due to their job. As a result, the difficulty of moving is constantly on their mind.</p>
<p>Shanghai is originally a den of all kinds of evils. Previous incidents have frightened the landlords, so there are regulations such as "No inquiries without family, no rent without guarantor." When I came to Shanghai as a bachelor, although I was fortunate enough not to be unemployed, I encountered great difficulties in renting a house. In the bustling areas closer to my workplace, even a small attic room often cost more than ten yuan, and there were unexpected problems such as midnight lights and all-night lights, and quarrels with the landlords. Moreover, in a Shikumen house, there were all kinds of people, sometimes making it difficult to sleep at night, and thefts also occurred from time to time. If I rented a house in an area farther from my workplace, the cost of transportation often accumulated into an alarming amount in a month, and various difficulties might arise in terms of time.</p>
<p>Later, my salary was higher, but after a bachelor became a cohabiting couple, the housing situation could no longer be the same as when I was single. Although an attic room could still accommodate me, the visits of my wife's family made it necessary to expand your living space. And as your professional status slightly increased, you also had more friends. As a result, friendship and professional relationships also made it necessary to expand your living space when friends came to visit you. Although the bedroom could also serve as a kitchen and toilet, a woman often did not have the same convenience as a man. If it also served as a reception room, various unexpected</p>
<p>difficulties would arise.</p>
<p>This is still the case for a small family. If you are responsible for the heavy burden of a large family, your parents, siblings, and children, even if they are your own family, cannot but add a few more pigeon coops. A salaried employee does not know how to allocate their expenses.</p>
<p>This is the development of a distorted society: on the one hand, large hotels and inns are increasing day by day, and on the other hand, people who have only had thin porridge are worrying about not being able to find a place to shelter from the wind and rain. However, on the surface, it is naturally obscured by prosperity. Many oppressed classes can only swallow their anger and remain silent.</p>
