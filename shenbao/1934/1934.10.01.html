<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c11">國聯停派技術聯絡員與我國自力建設　廷 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>曾任國聯駐華技術合作聯絡員拉西曼博士。最近復受委爲國聯衛生股長。而對華技術合作委員會。亦决定不另派員接替拉氏的遺缺。不過同時仍請國聯秘書處。採取必要措置。以謀各項技術合作事業的繼續發展。</p>
<p>記得我國政府於去年六月二十八日照會國聯行政院的時候。曾經懇切希望由國聯推舉技術人員一人。派至中國爲雙方技術合作的代表。結果即由技術合作委員會於七月十八日委派拉氏擔任。拉氏的任期定爲一年。到現在早已滿期了。可是他的繼任問題。就在任期未滿之前。亦已爲各方所注目。原來我國請派聯絡員。在日本退出國聯之後。日本因此而極感恐慌。對於拉氏。更認爲（定評之極端排日家）。而大肆攻擊。</p>
<p>就國聯旣往對日的立塲看來。我們不相信拉氏之所以不再被任爲駐華聯络員。乃是國聯對日屈服的表示。按拉氏自就任爲聯絡員後。其所遺衛生股長的職務。並非爲其同國人所繼承。所以有人認爲這不但是他個人的犧牲。還是他國家（波蘭）的犧牲。這次亦許就因爲拉氏預先向委員會聲明。本人無意繼續來華供職。亦未可知。不過國聯濟濟多士。不派拉氏繼任。儘可另派别人。何以竟連聯絡員一缺而暫行虚懸起來呢。大家對於這點。都在懷疑。以爲雙方技術合作的前途。恐將因此而受打擊。尤其是在中國竸選行政院非常任理事失敗後。覺得國聯此舉。有增加中國民衆失望的可能。甚至有屈服於日本的意味。</p>
<p>不過我們的觀察不同。第一。據國聯一九三五年度新預算案的規定。對華聯絡經費共計四十五萬金法郎。其中含有技術合作的费用在内。這是國聯樂與中國繼續合作的鐵證。第二。國聯早曾向日本明白表示。日本對於技術合作一事。無權可以干涉。我們觀察現狀。並不見有足以改變其舊日態度的新事實或新理由發生。而且國聯果眞對日屈服。亦須將整個的技術合作一事抛棄。派不派駐華聯絡員。比較起來。不過是個枝節問題。就是日本當初所以要反對拉西曼。亦還是在反對技術合作。</p>
<p>只偕反對拉氏爲其發脾氣的藉口罷了。</p>
<p>那末。這次停派拉氏後任的理由。究竟是什麽呢。我們居於局外人的地位。當然只能在情理範圍中去求答案。結果。我們所得的答案是。今後聯絡員的需要程度確實减少了。</p>
<p>中國最初在一九三一年四月要求國聯派遣聯絡員的時候。本曾聲明（該員留華之期限。則視事實之需要及中國政府之便利而定。）這點已由國聯接受了。現在如果要問聯絡員的需要何以見得確實較前爲减少。便須注意去年七月十八日技術合作委員會議决關於聯絡員四項職責的内容。聯絡員所以有駐在中國的必要。差不多完全根據於其第四項的職責。就是（恊助全國經濟委員會。就地調節國聯技術機關各專家之活動）這一項。換句話説。如果各專家在華的活動减少。聯絡員駐華的需要亦减少。或甚至於消滅。自拉氏返歐後。由國聯派遣在華服務的專家。尚有十餘人。但他們的合同時期。都是一年。而且都快期滿了。聽説經委會除酌留數員外。其餘將不再繼續延聘。大家多在凖備回國了。事實上的趨勢如此。那就怪不得技術合作委員會最近有不再派遣聯絡員的决議了。</p>
<p>多數的外籍專家解職後。究由何人繼續他們的工作。亦頗值得研究。照我們觀察。政府對於這點。似已胸有成竹。假若觀察不差。而且是值得稱揚的。在我國和國聯商定關於技術合作的六項辦法中。本有責成國聨（訓練中國自已之職員）一項。拉西曼氏在其報告書中。亦説（遴派專家赴華服務。其人數務以少爲宜。）（外籍專家在華服務。其工作之效果究屬有限）反之。他對於中國專家。則颂揚備至。認爲不可多得。我們對於拉氏的光明態度。向來欽佩。讀了他的報告的後。對於本國專家的能力亦格外增加了一層信仰。現在經委會旣有辭退滿期的外藉專家的凖備。同時又與教部合作成立全國學術工作諮詢處。儘先錄用國内技術人員。種種措置。大都含有修正技術合作的方式的意味。這點本在中國與國聯事前了解之中。而關於學術工作諮詢處等相類的組織。亦早曾由教部向國聯文化合作委員會表示。希望他們的合作。</p>
<p>就種種方面分析看來。我們認爲國聯技術合作委員會不派駐華聯絡員的原因。多半是受了中國修正方針的影響。而聯絡員的停派。却並不足以阻碍中國與國聯合作的前途。要知道雙方合作的範圍很廣。就是所謂技衛合作。亦不是光派幾個專家到中國。就可以包括得了的。國聯的最後目的。本在扶植中國人自已担任技術建設的能力。我們當然亦極端希望中國能够自力建設。不過中國技術專家最缺乏的是在外國實地辦事的經騐。經委會還須多多爲他們造就這種機會。然後可以利用他們去替代外國專家。而勝任愉快。</p>

<p>大學生與工人接近</p>
<p>農民則與市民接近</p>
<p>（國民新聞社柏林特訊二十三年九月）德國失業問題經勞工部設法救濟、現已有成効、記者訪晤勞工部長薛爾德詢問救濟勞動辦法、據談如次、近百年來人類一切制度無時不在變動中、故在此世界失業嚴重中、吾人不可不設法救濟之、失業問題、失業之原因不一而足、有各國相同者、有不相同者、或因某國特殊關係、而致發生失業恐慌、然究其失業原因尚非重要、第須觀察事實、用清晰之眼光求解决之方法與出路、如何始能救濟絶其禍源、</p>
<p>在德國、（或不僅德或而已）、卽其他國家、對勞動問題皆正在議論總合的方法、以免青年失業、而挽回風俗、秩序、救濟社會恐怖、自大戰結束後、德國之運働界大不如昔、人人均與國家聯在一起、大家有愛國思想因此德國政府在此情形之下得有强硬之後盾、現時德國爲工者總數有二十五萬人、彼等一力爲國家開創富源、人人有促進工業之根本思想、殊有利於國家經濟及秩序、茲立於人道主義方面、試略論究之、德國數十萬或數百萬少年、如皆進工廠作工、歲月不輟、勞苦異常、此種情狀、吾人不可視若無覩、須妥爲安置一切、吾人刻須改良工人生活、使所有工人不至同歸消滅死亡、救起青年、而國人對此殊不明瞭、只知此事之可懼、近來日内瓦軍縮會實施委員會已有論及救濟勞工問題、用儀禮之方法挽救德國青年、因救濟勞働其重要問題在教育及人格方面着手、固然社會情形須先注意及之、吾人不宜單以德意志一國而論、須推及各國、而法國切不可因此誤解、德國政府無卑鄙之見解、不借救濟勞働而謀充實軍備、如其不信、可到德國一看便知、更可知德國實專爲勞働界解除困難、並非有其他軍事目的、實爲工人而服務、所以救濟勞工非有惡意、乃爲拯救失業之青年、使德國人民將來不致變亂耳、</p>
<p>欲言救濟德國勞働、自然必先講求良好方法、須適合德國青年之性格、及整個德國民族性、吾人最善莫過於參酌各國之過去經騐、例如參考保加利亞國之辦法、因其國亦在困難中、救起所有勞働界、如吾人能參用各國勞働救濟辦法、以之救濟德國各處之失業人民、如此將來德國青年定有一綫光明希望、現在世界上無人能用人倫正義之方法而實現此種希望、在此困難之中、各階級人民均應共商辦法、共同負責、恊力合作、爲人民服務、領導青年入義禮之正規、所有大學生亦應與操手工業者與工人接近農人與市民接近、有學問者與無學問之人接近、造就無智識之人爲人而服役、大家盡其所能、自由救濟、須避去階級之衝突、免致人民死亡、如在希特勒領導之下、剷除階級門爭、因社會不同、宜公同救濟失業、而超越階級門爭之矛盾思想、爲至上之辦法、凡屬上帝所造之人、皆當共存共榮、</p>
<p>若吾人主要目標着在救濟勞働界之良好秩序及教育、果如是當無失策之虞、國民經濟、固吾人所應努力者、重在救濟勞働、故不與個人經濟競爭、今日各國情形最爲明顯、在自由個人經濟之途徑上斷不能有良好之結果與方法、亦不能解决國民經濟之問題、個人經濟、不能救濟失業問題、或完全解决失業問題、僅屬於企業家之私有故也、例如開闢荒田、灌漑田地、他如開闢馬路與其他一切企業、有利公衆盡人皆可無條件取而用之、但在危急存亡之秋、亦不可使個人經濟陷於危境、吾人對之、亦不可存輕視之心、個人經濟對於國家自有其意義、當國家由不恐怖狀態轉入恐怖時、抑或整理街衢、便利交通、乘公路不發展之時、俾以個人經濟能替國家營造一切、實行救濟勞働可自由設法按規則工作、須集千萬人之力、共同着手、在此情狀之下、宜自由救濟方面、直接的解决或利用未用之工作力、利用生産方法出銷剩餘之貨物、個人經濟乃開勞働事業之先、時時扶助人民有取得工作之機會、但有時個人經濟亦公開摧殘勞働事業、在各國各官署對此甚爲注意、因個人經濟不能直接有生産之能力現在國家欲乘此時機、實行大經濟計劃、尚非其時、國家欲於目前鼓勵公衆企業、則不可稍緩、此種原則、德意志共和國政府、正實心實力貫澈之、人人可以自由救濟勞働、结果當有可觀、余以勞工部長名義担保、我們的无首希特勒必能勇敢貫澈救濟勞働事業云、</p>

<h3 id="c151">辦理貝母運銷經過 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>每年生産過剩農民入不敷出</p>
<p>經濟稍裕即將直接推銷各地</p>
<p>新聲社云、自國藥號封存象貝、國醫團體議决在象貝風潮未解决前處方一律以前胡爲代寗波旅滬同鄉會召集調解未成、關於董江合作社與貝母運銷情形、據該社社員所述、分誌如下、</p>
<p>貝母産銷情形、貝母産於浙江鄞縣樟村、因土質關係、産颧不廣、每年産量約七八十萬斤、每年銷量約五十萬斤、過去每有生産過剩之虞、以致價格低落、統計産户五千八百七十三户、平均每户每年産百餘斤、一家數口、類此生活、而貝母每百斤之成本約計如下、種子四十元、地租十三元、肥料六元、人工十元、計六十九元、農民所産貝母、由商販收買、轉售藥行、由藥行售與藥店、復由藥店售與病家、經過中間商人層層剥削、農民所得、難保成本、</p>
<p>合作社之組織種植貝母之農民、鑒於商販剥削、非集合生産品整個運銷、不能祛除中間商人而保成本、故有合作社之自動組織、先將全數貝母非用金錢收買、一致集中、本社乃於民國二十二年三月一日正式成立、依據現行合作法規、呈請主管官廳核准設立、一切行政設施、有浙江省建設廳派員駐社指導、議案槪由社員代表大會公决、經官廳核准施行、經費在貨欵中提出百分之三、有餘作公積金、貨價由省建設廳限定每百斤市秤一百五十元、於生産者、與消費者雙方兼顧、每批售得貨欵、照集中數量、平均分發各社員、與營業性質、絶對不同、</p>
<p>現在運銷情形合作社因集中之貨、勢必先將貨欵若干、分發社員、而貨物一時無大量受主、故不得不將貨物向银行抵押借欵、銀行以藥物價格漲落無定、須有可靠藥行担保、故寗波四藥行、因爲本社担保抵押欵、而發生訂約承銷之互惠條件、此則本社成立伊始、受經濟控制之一大缺憾、然此則爲本社奮門過程中、必經之階段、故第一步與藥行訂立承銷契約、先取消商販階級使農民增加收入、而於病家負担、未增絲毫、至本社經濟不受控制時、實行第二步取消藥行階級計劃、向各埠直接運銷、成立以來、集中過剩貝母一百二十五萬八千斤、去年計銷五十萬斤、以每百斤約價一百元算、合計五十萬元、以此數分配於一百二十五萬八千斤、則農民所得每百斤祗四十元零、尚不到成本、即使全數售完、每百斤獲利亦僅三四十元、</p>
<p>糾紛調解經過此次上海藥業反對本社之遠因、由於去年該業公會、一度反對、本社委曲求全、予以低價貝母數萬斤、今年事過境遷、又指本社爲壟斷、借名减輕病家負担、創議拒用貝母、破壞合作、此案發生後、浙江省建設廳派合作專員唐巽澤、會同上海市政府社會局數度調解、翻覆曉諭、終因該公會代表、要求特别减價、因此調解不洽、其用心所在、則明眼人自能知之云、</p>

<p>漫談裏的（方言記錄）可與前面討論語文的文章同讀。（記黄小泉先生），（版本）二篇與一般人的實實際生活後有什麽關係外，其餘的四篇都很好，尤以（幽默的呌賣聲）和（略談中間讀物二篇比較精彩。前者把二件不被人注意的細事，用數百個字記錄下來，能使人讀了感覺到意味深長；後者是論現在那些旣然專門（硬性），也不是純粹（軟性）的所謂（中間讀物）的刋物。</p>
<p>太白創刋裏最使人值得注意的是（速寫）和（科學小品）兩欄，並且我們也可看出它是特别着重這兩攔。速寫本是小品文的原形，在外國已流行很廣了，它的好處是在於用最簡潔的文字，描寫出形形色色的社會相，同時，也是培養一般文學青年的文學寫作技能的好方法。至於科學小品之提倡，在目前羣呼一切科學大衆化的現在，無疑是有很重大，現在我們却要托科學從洋樓中搬到馬路上去，使大衆知道科學並不是什麽神秘的東西，誰都有權享受。</p>
<p>這次速寫欄的六篇短文，都能使人想相當的滿意。（大旱）與（阿九和他的牛）二篇，同是寫今年的旱災的，不過兩者的取材不同，一是着眼於農村社會情形的記載，一是側重於農人生活的描寫。我們從合這起來還不滿五千字的二篇文章中·却已看到了這旱荒中的各方面的形相。這種剪材結構等技巧，頗可爲有志於文學的青年們注意的。其餘如（一個車夫），（炎夏小記），（出嫁）等篇，都同様的用簡明的文字，描寫出社會某一角的細事，使人讀了如同囓橄欖，别有意味。</p>
<p>科學小品在中國還是一個剛産生小孩子，所以這裏的四篇文章雖然坸是從各人目前，所見所聞的事物寫起約不能使人當分滿意。缺乏文學趣味的描寫。只能算是科學常識的通俗解説。這項工作，原是一件很艱難的工作，在這科學不發達的中國，更其不易。因爲你如果是一位眞正的實殘的科學家，但你没有文學的修是不興的，而一般文家，則對科學没有深刻的研究。這裏的四位作者，我們知道已是國内有數的科學作家了。但我們也不必因不易而停止我們的嘗試，我們要希望大家加倍的努力，使科學眞能大衆化，使小品文另有新的生命。</p>
<p>總之，這本刋物在目前是值得向讀者推薦的。它的出版處是上海四馬路生活書店，現在特價，預定全年連票費共兩元。</p>

<p>昨據工務局代局長薛次莘　　氏語記者謂本體育塲之建築圖案、經市中心區建設委員會令建築師董大酉、及助理建築師王華彬等主持、並呈奉市政府核准、始於本年七月、由本局招標、投票人共十一家、由成泰營造廠以最廉標價得標承造、現已於八月一日開工、預定明年五月落成、</p>
<h3 id="c177">設計周備 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>薛氏繼稱、大體育塲設計、極爲新穎、於關於鋼骨混凝土屋架、出入交通路綫、以及宿舍布置、内外裝璜等、均足供本國其他各處設計體育場者之參考、而本場規模之大、容量之多、佈置之完備、乃能以百萬元之經費完成、尤見設計者之苦心經營云、</p>
<h3 id="c178">上海市體育塲工程槪要 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>一、緣起</p>
<p>上海市政府鑒於市内人口、已達三百萬以上、而大規模之體育塲、尚付缺如、殊不足以應市民鍜鍊體魄與業餘娱樂之需要、復以市中心區域成立伊始、必須有種設施、以新市民之觀感、而促進該區之繁榮爰籌於此建設市體育塲、謀一舉而兩得、民國二十三年初、即由市中心區域建設委員會建築師辦事處着乎設計、同年七月、市政府呈准中央發行公債三百五十萬元、並指定以一百萬元爲建築市體育塲之用、此建設上海市體育塲籌備經過情形之大略也、</p>
<p>二、位置</p>
<p>市體育塲旣須具相當規模、故所佔地面須在千公畝以上、爲免徵收民地及撙節經費起見、爰以市中心區域行政區西南第一公園之一部份、爲該塲之建築地址（第一圖中（五））、該處東面國和路、西通淞滬路、北接政同路、南界虬江、其南有淞滬、翔殷、其美、黄興、四幹道之交义點、北有將來淞滬鐵路通至三民路淞滬路口之車站、故往來交通稱便、</p>
<p>三、計劃槪要</p>
<p>市體育塲包括目前設置之運動塲、體育館、游泳池三部、及將來加建之網球塲、棒球塲兩部、（第二圖）佔地約三百畝、茲述其設計要點如次、</p>
<p>（甲）運動場</p>
<p>運動塲（第二圖中（一））、除供市民日常鍜鍊體魄外、並備舉行學校聯合運動會、全國運動會、遠東運動會、乃至世界運動會之用、其建築形式、及各項尺寸、大都視田徑賽及足球、籃球、綱球等競賽之需要而定、塲址不取Ｕ字形及圓形、而作鏈鐶形（第三圖）者、以如作Ｕ字形、則正門勢須設於凸出之一端、而對向交通上次要之政同路、殊覺不妥、又如作圓形、則徑賽上需要二百公尺長之直綫跑道、無法設置也、其他設計要點、亦經參考歐美著名運動塲之之佈置、審愼擬定、</p>
<p>本塲運看臺所佔之地位、總寛一百七十五公尺（五百七十四呎）、總長三百三十公尺（一千零八十二呎）、塲屋最高點距地面約二十公尺（六十六呎）、看臺圍牆高約十公尺（三十二呎）、塲地面積約三萬七千五百平方公尺（四十萬零四千方呎）、中央爲足球塲、排球塲及跳高、跳遠、擲鐵餅、國術等塲地、圍以環跑道、長約五百公尺、環跑道又於東西兩邊公岐爲直跑道、各長二百公尺、跑道外南北兩邊網球塲、籃球塲各三處、</p>
<p>看臺周圍長約七百六十公尺（二千五百呎）、寛約十七公尺（五十五呎）、可坐四萬人、立二萬人、其容量較南京運動塲、（座位二萬）爲大、</p>
<p>爲使數萬觀衆出入迅捷有序起見、設交通路綫兩種、（甲）環繞交通路綫、計分兩條、一設於收票地點之外、即環繞塲邊之過道（第三圖）及塲外四周之人行道與車馬道（寛九公尺）、另一設於塲内、即看臺上一·八公尺寛之環繞通路、（乙）上下交通路綫、聯絡環繞交通路綫與看臺座位之間、即看臺各段間之階級、下通塲邊過道、上達各座位邊者、此項階级共设三十四處、匀佈全塲每處以通行一千二百人計、數萬觀衆至多於五分鐘内、即可全數退出、每階級口設鐵質拉門、以便觀衆擁擠時收票員易於維持秩序、（按南京運動塲係設普能旋轉啟閉之門扇、致觀衆擁擠時、維持秩序、殊爲困難、）</p>
<p>在本塲之長邊、中央各設大門、以便運動員整隊出入、車輛亦可由此通過直撻塲内、</p>
<p>爲使觀衆目光得由看臺遍及塲地各部起見、看臺支承座位之樓板、係按曲綫佈置、其坡度自下往上繼續加激、搆造之法、係將每段樓級較下段各增高六公嫠（四分之一吋）、前後座位之距離計七十一公分（二十八吋）、故每一座位所佔面積爲四十五公分（十八吋）寛七十公分（二十八吋）深、按照前述容量、應設座位二十排、</p>
<p>運動塲備有充分宿所、足容納運動員二千五百人、以應舉行大運動會時之需要、又設壯麗之大門與大廳休息室、辦公室陳列室、訪事處、無綫電播音站、餐室等、其佈置之完備、即全世界運動塲中亦鮮有較勝者、</p>
<p>大看臺比兩處、東西遙相對、專備特别觀客及報館記者之座位、本塲看臺以經濟關係、槪不設置不椅、惟在西面平頂下之大看臺爲例外、</p>
<p>另一特别之點、爲利用看臺下地位設置店房、公厠、售票房（第三圖）其四周之過道、除輔助此項店房遮蔽風日外、又足資暴雨時觀衆引避之需、按照現定計劃、看臺下地位僅利用一半、其餘一半、則留備他日加建店房等之用、</p>
<p>運動塲用鋼筋混凝土作架、用紅磚砌牆、而以人造石爲外牆这勒脚及壓頂、東西大門採用中國形式、以人造石砌成、其餘構造頗屬簡單、</p>
<p>運動塲備有多數旗桿、於舉行運勳會時頗關重要、塲地及塲屋正面設泛射燈、</p>
<p>本塲之立面及剖面見第四及第五圖、</p>
<p>（乙）體育館</p>
<p>本館（第二圖中（二））除應市民各項户内運動之需要外、兼供集會之用、並可舉行展覧會及演劇、</p>
<p>容量爲座位三千五百及立位一千五百、必要時可加設臨時座位於運勳廳四周沿牆之處、</p>
<p>運動廳設於館屋之中央、地面用槭木舖　、寛約二十三公尺（六十三呎）長約四十公尺（一百三十一呎）、可排設普通籃球塲三處、爲正式比賽計、可置較大之塲位於中央、而於四邊多留餘地（第六圖）、館屋之總寛約四十六公尺（一百五十呎）長約八十二公尺（二百七十呎）、</p>
<p>運動廳四週之看臺支於堅固之鋼筋混凝土樑及磚牆、寛約十一公尺（三十六呎）、凡十三級、每級寛六十六公分（二十六呎）、高三十六公分（十四呎）至四十一公分（十六呎）、設計時假定之活儎爲每平方公尺六百一十公斤（每方吋一百二十五磅）連同靜儎每平方公尺一百二十公斤、（每方呎二十五磅）、總儎重爲每平方公尺七百三十公斤、</p>
<p>正門内大廳兩旁、方設階級一座、觀衆由此直達看臺、館屋後面兩邊、各設旁門及較狹階級、以便觀衆由此出館、</p>
<p>本國之圖案裝飾、於此開拱門三座、即館屋之正門、其餘外墻用紅磚砌築、而於頂部及底都鑲以人造石塊、</p>
<p>自正門入内、爲門廳、兩旁設售票房、再進爲大廳、兩旁設男女厠所及前前通看臺之階級、再進爲穿堂、直通運動廳、（籃球塲）及後面之健身房、旁達辦公到及會客室、又由兩邊各另經一門（第六圖中（丁）（、分别達男女運動員之更衣、淋浴、等室、由此可通運動廳、健身房及運動器具儲藏室、健身房兩旁設廚房及鍋爐間以及前述旁門之門廳與階級、</p>
<p>館屋之前後墻、高出平臺以上者、上邊成圓弧形、最高點高二十公尺（六十六呎）、兩邊外墻高約十二公尺（三十九呎六吋）、屋頂架前後排列、相距各六公尺七公寸（二十二呎）、爲三樞紐式鋼鐵拱形構架（第八圖）、其跨度、（即兩端樞紐點之距離）計四十二公尺七公寸、（一百四十呎）矢度（即中央樞紐點與兩端樞紐點之、垂直距離）計十九公尺半（六十四呎）、上弦之曲綫半經爲三十公尺（九十九呎）、邊部垂桿之高席、自兩端樞紐點起、計約十二公尺半、（四十一呎）</p>
<p>運動廳及健身房之採光、取高射式、以免運動員感眩目之弊、故於穹頂設固定排窗十孔、兩邊外牆高出看臺處開八角小窗各十六孔、又於前後墻高出平臺處設長方形窗各五孔、後兩種窗扇可以開啟、以使空氣流通、至於電燈、則弊於　鐵屋頂架之下、</p>
<p>館屋内之熱氣設備、採低壓式、熱氣冷凝之水、　自動都簡還入汽鍋、運動廳　健身房　　托通風　散佈暖氣、其他部分則直接利用然之辐射作用妈取暖、</p>
<p>（丙）游泳池</p>
<p>本游泳池（第二圖中（三））之設、以供市民水上運動及舉行游泳竸賽爲目的、池爲露天式、四周園以看臺、可容座四千、看臺下設更衣室·淋浴室·休息室·店房·公厠·鍋爐間·濾水機間等、看臺之北邊設宏麗之正門·門内設辦公室·客廳·大廳·售票房等、看臺下沿東西南三面建走廊通道、以應觀衆避雨之需（第九圖）、關於游泳池之尺寸、按照美國大學游泳竸賽規例、池面至少應爲長十八公尺（六十呎）、寛六公尺（二十呎）、池之深度在較淺之一端至少應爲九公寸（三呎）、在較深一端至少應爲一公尺半（五呎）、本池之尺寸、經與本市體育界商酌、擬定計長五十公尺、寛二十公尺、池底於長邊方向作匙形、由一端深約一公尺一公寸（三呎半）起、向中央漸漸加深至一公尺七公寸（五呎半）、然後由中央至距他端五公尺（十六呎）之處、陡降至三公尺半）十一呎半）之深度、此項深度、爲遠東運動會所規定者、）</p>
<p>池身用鋼筋混凝土及防水材料構造、以足以抗禦池滿時之（水壓）及池空時之（土壓）爲度、池底打椿七百二十五根爲基、池底及池邊鋪白色瑪賽克、四璧砌白磁磚、</p>
<p>本池之容量、約爲二千二百立方公尺（六十萬加侖）、此項鉅大水量、若時時更換、所費勢必不體育館建築工程情形（王開攝）</p>
<p>資、且每次更換須閲十小時、亦殊不便、爰置濾水設備、使濁水出池後、復變爲清、再返入池、循、環不已、計每次循環、凡五階段、即（一）消毒（二）濾清、（三）入池、流通、（五）出池、此項濾清工作、可於游泳季節内繼續不停、每經過一次消毒與濾清、水質益形潔凈、</p>
<p>池内燈光設備、採最新式、即於水面下池壁内置强光燈包、使燈光水色打成一片、而成整個（光源）、於夜間觀之、至爲悅目賞心、反之、若以燈光下照池内、則因水面之反射作用、池外雖極明亮、徒眩游泳者之目、水内則顯幽暗、足滋發生意外時救護之困難、故燈光設於池内水面以下之辦法、有便利游泳與救護兩優點、當今夏夜游泳寖成風習之際、殊有採用之必要、本池及附屬建築物之設計、固以實用爲旨歸、而對於美觀一點、亦經加以注意、大門墻垣用人造石塊砌成、上加雕刻、顯示本國女化色彩（第十圖、）其餘墻垣用紅磚砌築、而以人造石爲勒脚及壓頂、以資經濟、就本池全部建築物觀之、所有建築形式與運動塲及體育館互相適應、</p>
<p>查歐美各國之游泳池、往往附帶小池、深度在一公尺二公寸以下、專供兒童游泳之用、本池以限於經費頂算之故、未能兼顧此項設備、殊屬缺憾、</p>
<p>（丁）綱球及棒球場</p>
<p>體育塲之中部及西北角、擬建綱球塲（設球塲三處及座位四千之看臺等）及棒球塲（附座位四千之看臺）各一處、）第二圖中）四（及（五））、留待將來興工、不在此次舉辦工程之範圍内、</p>
<p>（四）施工</p>
<p>運動塲、體育館及游泳池之建築圖案、經市中心、區城建設委員會建築師董大　君及助理建築師王　彬君主持設計完成、並呈奉市政府核准後、即於二十三年七月由工務局招標、投標人十一家中、由成泰以最廉標價得標承辦、旋於八月間開工、於十月一日舉行奠基典禮、預定於二十四年五月落成、</p>
<p>（五）餘言</p>
<p>本工程設計上不乏新穎之點、如關於鋼筋混凝土屋架、出入交通路綫宿舍佈置、年臺下店房等設備以及内外裝璜等、在在足供本國其他各處設計體育塲者之參考、而以本塲規模之大、容量之多、佈置之完備、乃能以百萬元左右之經費完成之、尤見設計者之苦心孤詣焉、</p>

<p>陶小柳以作古聞，南社詞人又弱一個矣。君贛之南昌人，諱牧，字伯蓀，小柳其别署。早歲游幕四方，客燕京尤久，年來以名士現宰官身，頗著政跡。與涇縣胡檏盦，山陰胡粟長，婁東兪劍華，最爲友善，偶作詩詞，傳遞唱和以爲樂。君有聲色之好，更喜琵琶一曲，玉靨半遮，謂琵琶之爲物，柱配津吕，有八十四調之多，於音樂上價值，不在七絃琴下。某年覊旅滬上，天寒歲暮，無以爲遣，乃徵歌者來彈唱，聊資一權，然曲院中人，輓近以還，每歌輒用胡琴，由龜奴伐拉，故徧徵無能輕攏細撥者，君爲之悵悵，調寄琵琶仙一闋，以志其感云：）廻想當年，可聽取怨曲琵琶凄絶，誰料抛卻青衫，歌聲頓消歇，休坐洗檀槽涙迹，算閑了幾番風月。軸轉情移，更闌酒漉，愁共啼鴂。又還在銀燭秋堂，想懷抱香濃縐衣槢。曾伴綠鬢低唱，苦涼州哀徹，留萬古興亡嘆賞，盼夕陽眼底相識。鼓斷絃索，樽前細堪重说。）君詩亦多蒼凉變徵之音，殆環境使然歟？如貽樸盦云：（與君把酒話平生，不鑄黄金錯鑄情，斷梗長飄塡恨海，著書無分剩詩名。此心似水灰同冷，白眼看人燭太明，最是春風吹又到，緣楊深處鷓鴣聲。）綜計君之一生，詩富於文，詞更多於詩，未知所作能留稿不散佚否？大可梓刋一詞集行世也。</p>

<p>前年我到漢口，路過九江，抵了碼頭，有少販賣磁器的小販，以各種各様的磁器，到船上來兜賣。其中有一隻很大的花瓶，色彩非常典雅而鮮艶，那小販竭力游説我買，我回絶他説：這麽大的花瓶，我没有用。他却笑道：先生把它帶回去可以作爲廳堂中的裝飾呀！原來這種大花瓶，祗能作爲裝飾用的！</p>
<p>現在有不少投機的商店，他們用了不少的美貎女職員，作爲吸引顧客，點綴門市之需。這些老關們並非爲了適應潮流，而開放女子職業；他們是適應現在大衆的心理，以脂粉和肉香，作發展他商業方面的企圖。因此女職員所賣錢的，丨丨當然不是全部分。並不在伊們的學術和技能，却在賣却伊們如花一般的青春，要是你年歲已大了啊，恐怕你的職位要和青春一般的逝去了丨所以現在有人喻女職員彷彿是用以裝飾的一隻花瓶。</p>
<p>一個心高氣傲的女子，當然不願領受這様一個迹近侮辱的頭銜。商店中的花瓶，不就是社會上的廢物？况且做花瓶還是出賣青春的玩意兒，女子出賣青春，不是够人嘆息和扼腕的一件事嗎！女子一様有伊的智力和才幹，爲什麽僅僅能做一個花瓶呢？這固然一半是爲環境，可是一半也爲了自已太明地顯在做着人家的玩物了。一般女職員擃裝艶抺，盡態極研，這是在努力做成一隻（色彩非常典雅而鮮艶）的花瓶哪！</p>
<p>更可怪的：女子自認花瓶，恬不爲怪，前幾天我往訪表妹某女士，伊説這學期豫備輟學去當任便公司洋行的女職員了。我説女職員没有什麽意思，還是多求些學問好，况且你現在的智識恐怕還不足當一個幹練的女職員。伊却笑説：那末就做花瓶也好。可見現在一班女子，還如（娜拉）未出走時代，呼伊，爲小貓兒小雀兒，甘之如飴呢！</p>

<h3 id="c205">説開篇 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 張枕緑</p>
<p>（開篇），什麽呌做（開篇）？我想，在我們本國，總有幾省的人不懂開篇爲何物。（開篇），不是（開末拉），（開士米）一般來路貨式的摩登名目，乃是由來已久的道地國粹。顧名思義，（開篇）是開始的一篇，大家都懂得。不過，像書報開塲的發刋詞，專集前面的序文，都不能稱爲開篇的，任憑那意義儘是相當。必須一篇自爲起訖的韻文，在氣管嗷嘈聲中，把吳儂美化的口音唱出，照老例是用在説小書的人（所謂彈詞家）彈唱正書之前的，纔呌做（開篇）。</p>
<p>話旣表明，我們要知道開篇的意義，還得把説書人的來路先提一番，所謂（還他爺娘家路），不管講得有没有錯。</p>
<p>説書先生（尊稱之也）有説大書，説小書，一種分别。説大書的，他們的脚本是演義小説之類，所以説時注重説和演，不借别項助力。大書起源在宋時，漸由宫　流行到民間，當時稱爲演史，也稱評話。在皇帝老兒那處所，所謂（天顔咫尺），臣下們不免扮起一副正經面孔，自然趨於單調了。説小書的脚本便是彈詞小説，根本獨多有韻之詞，須以絲竹吹彈相助，使得所説的書側重於藝術化。這項玩意兒，也在宋時早已開端，是有盲女自撥琵琶，説唱故事，流轉於陌頭里巷間，那完全是説小書的排塲。在古人的詩歌和私家記載的作品裏，可以見到上項的情形。從女子口裏説唱出來，自然嬌媚動聽，沿習下來，於是現在説小書的雖多男子，最宜用吳儂口吻，保存原有的風格。</p>
<p>至於説小書開塲時，先唱一篇開篇，是要使聽衆在正書外，得到一點特殊的趣味的貢獻，大都是怡悅性情，或是挑逗情感。演義小説，説大書的脚本，在每回書的前面有一二首詩或詞，正與彈詞小説前面有開篇，有同様的用意，丨丨增加趣味。只是説大書人没有樂器爲助，不便把詩詞單獨上口，難不成仿效和尚放燄口時念詩句的腔調念出來，詩詞又比開篇不大通俗，所以乾脆免了。</p>
<p>開篇旣爲貢獻特殊的趣味而設，自然不要與正書有相同的意義了。若説開篇的材料，不論前朝，近代，理想之境，烏托之邦，所有忠臣，義士，思婦，勞人，以及小品文取材所許的宇宙之大，（對不起，又來一句，）蒼蠅之微，何時何地覓不到做開篇的材料啦？可是，構成一篇開篇，有若干主要條件：他要捉住可資描寫的題材加以適可的剪裁，要在不宜過長也不宜過短的限量内描寫得極度深刻化，要在通俗的辭句上加以修飾的詞藻，要有開篇所獨具而異於詩詞歌賦的聲韻。這些幾乎兼有詩，歌，小説，戲劇，一切文藝作品之長，所以創作開篇也不是一件容易的事。</p>
<p>現在説小書人多數没有資格會自已創作，通達的文人之輩又不免藐視爲小道而很多不屑爲，於是我們聽到的開篇，常是那一批古董，也有好多是鄙俚不通的。偶然有一二篇文人遺與之作，或是由那尚算有志氣的説書人特地煩人做了應用的，唱出聽到，已覺新頴動聽，算是難得的耳福了。一篇新作唱出，輾轉爭相仿唱，對於字句識别念强，以訛傳訛，自也視爲常事而不以怪了。</p>
<p>最近有倪高風君，勤作開篇，將出專集，要我説幾句，就拉雜寫此。</p>

<p>再説那兩頭鸚鵡是格外教人失望了丨當然，我對於它們的毛片，自也不能抺殺事實，不讚一聲美麗：無奈毛片盛管美麗，可厭却終是可厭。它們简直整天不停的在吵鬧，除掉我們睡覺的時候，不知道它們是否依舊還在吵閙之外，只要我們醒着的時候，便不停的聽見它們在喊老佛爺吉祥如意），（老佛爺平安），願來倒去的老是這兩句刻板的頌詞。喊到後來，幾乎使我們每個人都聽得頭痛了，恨不能用什麽東西去塞住它們的嘴；可是太后却不但不覺得可厭，而且每聽它們喊一句，臉上必露出一絲笑容，誰也不知道伊究竟有什麽興趣感到！從這一點上推想起來，我不由不分外的佩服袁世凱了！他是何等的善於迎合太后的心理啊！光是教那兩頭鸚鵡説兩句極尋常的吉利話，也就收到了極好的效果；以後，只要太后每聽一次鸚鵡呌，伊便不能不想到袁世凱。這様，袁世凱的竉信，自然是格外的鞏固了！</p>

<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>近幾天。董江貝母運銷合作社。和上海市國藥業同業公會。不知爲了什麽一重内幕。以至破臉大鬧。一方説是救濟農付。一方說是壟斷勒價。這本是藥品賣買上的一種權利衝突。可以説批發和拆兌之間的利益爭執。儘可由商業中的人物。和同業中的分子。居間調停。研究箇折衷的辦法。使雙方都能維持自已的權利。便可了事。萬萬料不到因這區區商人間的貨價爭執問題。而引起舊醫們排斥藥品的一哄舉動。説到廢棄一種藥品。和代用一種藥物。在學術上。是何等重大的問題。在民生上。更是何等重大的問題。第一。决不能以少數的舊醫分子來操縱全國。第二。决不能拿商人間貨價爭執的標題。來主張論斷。第三。學會是研究學術的集會。和職業團體。顯有區别。更犯不着身分破産一窩蜂似的加入其中。與人爭執貨價。我覺得這都是舊醫們自少斟酌的輕舉妄動。至被明眼人在旁指摘批評。嗤笑朋比。是何等可惜可恥之事啊。這裏就我箇人知見。對於這箇問題。可以分作幾節來研究一下。</p>
<p>（一）關於藥品的廢棄問題這個問題。當以學術爲立脚點。從來舊醫用藥的根據。是拿人來做試騐品的结果。所以一藥的入譜。早不知犧牲了多少病人的身體。面我們現在要廢棄牠時。必定有一種指摘牠的要點。和學術上的證明。方才光明正大。面現在舊醫們。因爲藥商的貨價爭執上區區不題。便主張廢棄象貝。用前胡來代。並且最後。自已還聲明（一俟象貝價格回復原狀。或藥農得以自由販賣時。再行通告開用）云云。彰明較著地説。全爲價格的關係而廢棄。全爲價格的關係。而以牠品代用。這全不是學者的口氣。全不是學會的態度。更不是仁術的本旨。（對於病人負擔問題在後節解决之）。</p>
<p>（二）關於國民的經濟問題國民經濟的意義。從前因爲居民對峙。所以説財聚則民散。財散則民聚。一類的學説。但是現在的國民經濟不是拿國内集羣。來做對象。要拿國際間來做對象。因此現代的經濟學家。將向外發展做主眼。比方像德國美國等。往往將國内同類的工商事業。集中組合。使國内不相競爭排斥。可一致向外發展。以維持國民經濟。充裕國家財源。現在舊醫們。旣認識）外貨傾銷農村破産的原理。爲什麽對於合作社救濟農付。力加反對。爲什麽對於推銷内貨。要擯斥。而外貨（像洋參燕窩之類）依然應用。不設法以牠品來代。在病人與農民之間。究竟誰是親。誰是疎。同關同胞的生活。談不到國民經濟。大家都曉得排斥國貨。便是推銷外貨。所以這類排斥的舉動。正足以（助外國貨物之傾銷。促中國醫藥之壽命）啊。</p>
<p>（三）關於病家的負擔問題人生不幸患病。在痛苦之外。更增加醫藥的負擔。所以對於减輕病人負擔。吾輩很表同情。不過據合作社方面説。賣出代價。每擔不滿一百四十元時。藥舖門市售價。每兩需洋四角四分。將此數合計。每擔洋七百餘元。病人的負擔。大半在藥店。據徐重道藥號説。要派員揀選。要浸飲切片。要揀剔切片，要佣金貨繳。都是工字上的損耗。又要耗蝕石粉碎屑。蒂頭。要耗蝕切片。要逢期减價。還要秤耗。都是質量上的損耗。公誤公有理。婆説婆有理。平心而論。中國藥舖的藥品。對於門市的價格。絶無標準。竟可以説。走十家。有十個價錢。走百家。有百個價錢。也不爲過。據他們自圓共説的對付買主。説是貨有高下。究竟他的高下。用什麽來做標準。還是一個大疑問。所以病家的負擔問題。各藥舖進貨的價值上。固然有關。而眞正的癥結。恐怕還在各藥舖的本身。各藥舖的良心。試看年來各藥舖數的增加。和他們業的擴張。事實便是證據。</p>
<p>（四）關於疾病的治療問題一藥有一藥的性狀。有一藥的功用。那都是吾們所公認的。所以别的東西。或者可以馬馬呼呼借用。而藥品。絶對不能張冠李戴。但是眞正萬不得已的時候。也未嘗不可拿性效最切近的東西。來將就一下。現在象貝。旣不是没貨。又不是學理上新發見了什麽害處。性效又絶不接近。單單爲了藥商們的貨價爭執。而舊醫們便把前胡代用。一不衡量疾病上的利害。所謂司馬昭之心也。茲對於象貝和前胡性效上不同之點。撮要於後。以供同界的參考。</p>
<p>（甲）舊醫們説。象貝不見本草綱目。後人習用以治外感咳嗽。採用區域。僅爲江浙兩省。及山東一隅云云。我以爲神農本草的藥味。本不過三百六十種。梁陶宏景。增數至倍。到了唐宋。更加入不少。金元明。又添了三十九種。李時珍。更續補了三百七十四種。照現在坊間流行的本草綱目。已有一千八百七十一種。但是没有收入的東西。而舊醫們常用的。正不在少數。假使本草綱目上不載。而我們便主張不用。那末當時神農本草。只有三百六十種。何以後人要加入許多呢。可知古籍所載外的經騐藥。正是用藥進步之徵。有效的。我們正宜加入。並且本草綱目。明明載着（貝母出潤州荆州襄州者最佳。江南諸州亦有）。雖不指明象山。而象山。當在江南諸州之内也。不能説牠不載。倘然説向來因爲貪便宜。而以江南劣貨充用。那更不成一句話了。</p>
<p>（乙）我們從來社會上流行。而稱爲消痰藥的品類很多。像遠志。括樓。枳實。半夏。五味子。桔梗。麥門冬。欵冬花。土木香。狼把草。沙參。松蘿。荆瀝。石長生。天門冬。鼠鞠草。竹瀝。馬兜鈴。浮石。磠砂。刀豆。旋覆花。。柴苑。百部。甘草。桑白皮一類的主效。都説是化痰。而决非只有貝母前胡兩種。不過一考牠的内容。各有特殊的功能。有决不能勉强代用者。因爲我國從前醫學上。稱做痰的一物。範圍極大。包括極廣。若由廣義的講。身體内五臟六腑。無處無痰。而所謂狹義的痰。凡從口腔排泄出外的粘膩分泌物。不問牠生在何部。來自何途。總括一句那可稱做牠是痰。所以鼻腔。咽喉等處的分泌物。氣管食道等處的分泌物。肺胃的分泌物。都混做一氣。總稱牠做痰症。而用的藥品。也總稱牠做消痰。或化痰藥。並没有絲毫的區别。可是在從來經騐上。對於用藥。則頗有斟酌。大有出入。比方像感冒多痰。宜用遠志桔梗等。痰飲多痰。常用半夏甘草等。其實感冒的痰。大都是喉頭氣和的分泌物。痰飲的痰。完全是食管咽胃的分泌物。牠發生的部位全異。分泌的成分也不同。那末醫治牠的藥品。當然各具功能。僅就這兩例來比喻。所謂我們從前的消痰化痰藥。不管牠治熱痰。濕痰。寒痰。氣痰等等的説數。總逃不出這個理由。所以舊時稱做消痰化痰的藥品。有時絶對不能代用。不能通融。</p>
<p>（丙）象貝和前胡。是否可以通融代用。照我輩的知見。可以説一句。絶對不可能。爲什麽呢。因爲這兩種的功能。正如上面所講的。各有主治目標。照舊醫的口吻來説。就是所走經不同。比方像五飲湯内。用前胡。不用貝母。痰咳化痰丸内。用貝母。不用前胡。由這一點上看。不咳嗽的痰。大都不宜用貝母。換一句説。不咳嗽的痰。不是氣管和一路來的分泌物肺。我們再把從前舊時眞正名醫的方案來查查。痰飲的藥方上。可以説一句。没有貝母可見。而咳嗽痰的藥方。用貝母的很多。因此我們可以下一句斷語。貝母。是作用於呼吸器。前胡。是作用於消化器。兩種藥品。絶無通融代用之可能。事實便是證據。褚慧僧氏致吳市長函中。所講的前胡治咳痰無效一層。眼前的眞憑實據。所以舊醫們。因爲藥業中貨價爭執的一點小事。而把這個出入疾病。關人生的藥品大問題。不加一些研究和考慮便輕描淡寫的説。彼此可以代用。不但自已失其身價。堂堂的一個學會。而弄出如此貽誤病人的笑話。眞是荒天下的大唐。咳。舊醫的每况愈下。於此可見。</p>
<p>有人説。這次舊醫界的奮不顧身。運用全力來替藥業界大登廣告。恐嚇威脅。似乎有些做人傀儡的様子。而其實。也全爲了自已的切身利益。因爲幾個舊醫學會中的中堅人物。不是藥店的老閭。便是藥店的大股東。一而二。二而一。爲了個人的利益。不惜犧牲學術。犧牲學會。犧牲舊醫全體。而閙出這塲倒霉臭風潮。但是據褚慧僧氏的體騐。閔行便買到了象貝。閔行還是没出上海縣的境界啊。一窠蜂的效力。便可想而知了。唉。</p>

<p>— 江晦鳴</p>
<p>（一）小引</p>
<p>中國衛生行政的幼稚，醫藥界的龐雜，在任何國家，都没有像這様一副怪型。本報有各地醫藥衛生狀况徵文之舉，確實已抓住了一個問題的核心：今後要改進中國衛生行政。及深切明瞭中國各地醫藥狀况。祗有從這條路，還可以博得一點收穫。</p>
<p>這裏所説的，不過是安慶局部的醫藥衛生情形，問題已經很狹窄，而作者的能力又有限，苦不能很精密地寫出一切，除了深深地表示着慚愧外，請作芹嚗之獻。</p>
<p>（二）衛生政之一斑</p>
<p>安慶，雖是安徽的省城：然而境内貧瘠，市民教育程度之不整齊，可以説就無衛生行政可言。這裏且將當地幼稚的衛生的槪况，約略的寫一點：</p>
<p>民初以還，安慶的衛生行政，隸屬安徵政務廳鞅掌，那時北洋政府，還没有統一衛生行政的規劃：直到國民革命</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>鼎革以來，國民政府，設立衛生專部後，安慶始由安徽省會公安局，專設衛生科，辦理市内衛生。其間，約在民國十八年，安慶雖一度設立市政府，但並無衛生局設立，仍由公安局衛生科處理一切。統覈以往衛生科的成績，因歷任主持人員，大都没有受過相當衛生行政的訓練，而且有絶對未受過醫藥衛生教育的人，結果，對於市内衛生環境如何改良，出生死亡如何統計，防疫工作如何進行，江湖流醫如何取締等，尚未着手進行。</p>
<p>關於市内醫生登記，雖然在民國十六七年開始舉行，更是錯誤百出，什麽資格的審查，中西醫生登記證的分别，都不講求，截至現在全市已經登記的中西醫生，將接近二百人。還有醫院管理及其登記取締的條例，等於一紙具文，更不能談了。</p>
<p>在民國十九年，陳調元主政安徽的時候，安慶曾發起一次全市衛生運動大會，凡是當地領袖人物，都拽着長帚，參加遊行。可惜至今無人繼起舉行，市民也許淡忘了。</p>
<p>安慶的民衆教育館，雖有一部分公共衛生工作，如在夏天翻印些預防傳染病的小册子，沿街通衢粘貼些衛生圖表，舉行衛生演講，以及發起嬰兒健康比賽會，嬰兒種痘會等，然而實際的收穫，還不多見。</p>
<p>近年來，在夏季例有防疫會的組織，由安徽省民政廳會同當地各大醫院辦理，如免費注射防疫針，收容傳染病人，並在同仁醫院設立隔離室等，較有規模，所有經費，年在五千元左右，可惜限於財力，難得有更進的發展。茲將歷年附設（夏令防疫診療所）之醫院名稱列後：</p>
<p>一，丨同仁醫院，二，丨健生醫院，三，丨博儒醫院，四，丨廣仁醫院，五，丨惠民醫院。</p>
<p>（三）新舊醫之業務情形</p>
<p>安慶的社會，十分籠罩着半新不舊的彩色。論醫生的業務，還是舊醫经較發達。近幾年水災旱災的頻祲，舊醫在社會上依然照様的活躍，這原因很單純：多由於農村旣已宣告破産，政府又裁員减薪，而生活的負担日益加重。故一般薄有資産及一班公務人員，對於每個家庭的醫藥費用，更是感到意外的支絀。爲了節省經濟，多請比較經濟的舊醫，來解决疾苦和困難。所以在安慶頗負名望的醫生，每月收入平均約在六百元左右。中等醫生，約在百元上下。至於不負時譽的醫生呢，也太可憐了，每月能有十元的進入，亦難若登天。</p>
<p>新醫在社會，隨着時代進展，市民中的智識份子，信仰的也漸漸地多起來。新醫開業，多少需要一些設備，組織醫院的，更須聘請醫師，所以并支較舊醫爲繁。安慶的最大醫院，要算同仁醫院，也還要仰賴美國教會津貼，及額外募捐，纔可以维持。因爲同仁醫院玉持人員，多是國人，頗能以慈善爲懷，作周濟貧病的事業。每日平均診治的病額，約在二百號以上，論業務的發達，與設備的完善，也祇有這同仁醫院合得上正式醫院的條件。其餘私人設立的醫院，祗是限於經濟，能够以醫院自給的，便算很不容易了。因此，私人醫院院長及醫師，還要向外另謀兼職，如校醫，官醫，警醫，軍醫等，來彌補一切。</p>
<p>安慶的小兒科，特别缺乏，常有老嫗術士，掛起善治小兒驚風的招牌，業務亦頗不惡。至於走方的郎中，書符袪魔的僧道，新式賣解的江湖醫生，狐仙，靈佛等，還有不少的人特别信仰，作者只有深深的嘆道：予欲無言。（本完）</p>

<p>（四）（十）（一）絛蟲類（下）</p>
<p>（問）短小條蟲的形態怎様？蟲卵怎様？</p>
<p>（答）短小絛蟲，是絛蟲中最短小的一種，長約一至四糎蟲卵被厚殻，内部見鈎六個。</p>
<p>（問）狗絛蟲是怎様的？</p>
<p>（答）這種絛蟲，是寄生在狗體内的。如果狗的大便汚染了菜蔬後，便傳染到人體，而以肝臟做中間宿主，成爲肝包蟲腫。</p>
<p>（問）人體被絛蟲寄生後，起什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）大都没有什麽病狀發現。但有時起腹痛，泄瀉或便秘等。</p>
<p>（問）還有什麽全身症狀？</p>
<p>（答）有食慾不振，易餓，全身倦怠，精神不安，氣力全無等。也有發頭痛，眩暈，惡心，嘔吐，心悸亢進，瞳孔散大，以及不規則的脈搏和痙攣等的。</p>
<p>（問）病人的症狀在什麽時候最易顯明？</p>
<p>（答）在吃了鹹食或刺戟性的食物像鹹魚葱韮蒜等之後，容易顯出病狀來的。</p>
<p>（問）裂頭條蟲寄生之後，有什麽顯著的病狀？</p>
<p>（答）病人呈惡性貧血的病狀。</p>
<p>（問）狗條蟲寄生在人體之後起什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）因爲狗絛蟲的蟲卵，進入胃内，卵膜化去，胎蟲進門脈入肝臟，便生肝包蟲腫。在肝表面起彈性浮動性的隆起，或有化膿而成肝膿瘟的。也有發腹水，黄疸脾腫的。</p>
<p>（問）絛蟲的診斷方法，是怎様的？</p>
<p>（答）在乎糞便中證明絛蟲的節片，或蟲卵。無鈎絛蟲的節片，各個方離，其他的稍稍連續數片。又從子宫形和生殖孔的位置而區别他們。有鈎絛蟲的蟲卵，不容易在糞例中發見。</p>
<p>（問）絛蟲的預防法怎様？</p>
<p>（答）預防法·凡魚肉牛肉猪肉等，務須煮熟後纔可食用。凡家畜或保有絛蟲的人，必須充分消毒。</p>
<p>（問）驅除條蟲的藥劑，應該到什麽時候，可以給服？</p>
<p>（答）必須等到糞便中證明絛蟲節片之後，纔得給與驅蟲劑。</p>
<p>（問）爲什麽呢？</p>
<p>（答）因爲驅蟲劑，往往伴有相當度的危險性，所以在擬似病人以勿用爲妥。尤其在衰弱者，肝癆者，老年人，孕婦，虚弱的小兒等，都不宜用。</p>
<p>（問）驅除絛蟲的藥劑，普通是那幾種？</p>
<p>（答）普通用的是綿馬浸膏（極量一○○，○綿馬油（一○·○）石榴根皮（極量五○·○）可蘇花·卡馬拉花等。（完）</p>

<p>温度增高重要的情形，上面已經詳述過了，但少數　外，也時當習見的。尋常像甲狀腺機能增高，副腔化膿，慢性盲腸炎，腹部器官慢　炎症，以及山扁桃腺或牙部發生的炎症，他們的温度都較平當增高，和肺結核情形相彷彿的。應付這一種情形，除開憑籍長期的温度昇降報告和精密的　量外，在肺結核的本身，也有實點特徵的：這雖然太嫌瑣碎了，但是人人都可測騐的，所以我覺是狠值得提出説一説。</p>
<p>第一：本病的温度是狠容易移動的。尋常病人在早晨起身的時候，温度大抵是正常的：但祇須經過先面漱口這一種小事情，就會馬上上昇五六分的，此外像讀書寫信，也會發生同様情形的。第二：經過一種動作，温度當然是發生變化的。這一種情形，在尋常康健的人們，也會發生的；别的劇烈運動固不用説，像平常一小時散步的工作，就可以上昇的。但他的測量報告，是在三十八度以下的，和本病的超過三十八度，一望卽可區别的。此外，在康健的人們，祇須有半小時的休息，温度卽可恢復正常狀態的：但結核病者，是非雙倍以上的時間不行的。第三：在早晨温度較增高：可逹到三十七度或三十七度以上，在夜晚是不發生的。這種和尋常完全相反的情形，在本病的開始時候，齊巧有很多的例證的。</p>
<p>根據病理解剖上情形種種不同，結核病者的熱度也隨爲轉移的。尋常慢性纖維性的經過，是狠多没有熱度的：滲出性的型式，是大多數發現高熱或弛張性熱型的；在發生空洞的時候，消耗熱是特殊顯著的：尋常的腺體結核，温度的增加，大抵是不狠利害的。</p>
<p>關於肺結核症的幾個重要症象，現在都一一的分述過了。最後還有一種情形，是狠習見的，就是：結核病者的心理，是狠易　　和刺激者，對於旁人的任何動作，都容易使他憤怒的，結果幾乎成了利已者了，這在婦女方面比較更多；有些病者是過度悲觀的，就是有希望的輕症也是如此的：也有狠抱樂觀的，對於痊愈的要求是非常熱烈的。這種過與不及的情形，當然不是單靠藥物治療所可奏效的；甚至狠正當的治療，有時的效果，也不免大爲减色的。對於性慾方面，病者大半是亢進的：在青年的男女病者，甚至對於結婚的内在心理思非常熱烈的。這當然不能輕易嘗試的丨對於新家庭方面的傳染危險，卽使捨開不提：在婦女方面，結婚後受孕和胎産，都足以使本病日趨於惡劣的。這一個社會上的問題，我希望無論病者或非病者，都要重視纔好。（本章完）</p>

<p>（十）（七）砂眼</p>
<p>關於砂眼的歷史和他對於國家的影響。我已經在上一期講過。我們常然承認他是一種傳染病。並且還是一種接觸傳染病。這種有傳染性的細菌。直到現在醫學發達的時候。還是不能確定證明。歐美各國和東方的日本。都有研究團體的組織。政府也準備了奬勵金。等着發明家的領取。所以這種細菌的證明。也許爲期不遠啊。我們現在已經知道的。就是這種細菌，一定是存在患着砂眼病人的眼分泌物中（卽眼涙等）。他可以直接的或間接的。從手指，手巾，臉水，和他種器具的媒介。傳播到别人。在分泌物多的時候。他的傳染危險亦多。還有羣衆雜居（如監獄，學校，孤兒院，兵營，工塲，娱樂塲）和有公共手巾的地方（如茶館，菜館，浴堂，）那就他的傳染機會更多了。</p>
<p>講到砂眼的症候。因病的輕重而有不同。最輕的砂眼。病人往往自已還不知道患着砂眼。毫不感覺什麽痛苦。有時在檢查體格的時候。往往由醫師發見砂眼的存在。或者從自已覺得有了流涙，怕光，疼痛，分泌眼汚，眼緣粘着，眼内灼熱，眼内發赤，眼内異物感覺，和視物糢糊等等。方才疑心是砂眼。這個時候，如　反轉眼臉（眼皮）。就可看見眼臉結膜（眼皮　面）發赤充血和混濁。散佈黄灰白色然稍帶橢圓形的細小顆粒。顆粒有時個個都是隆起。高出結膜面。顆粒的多少。各有不同。槪依病的輕重而異。此等顆粒，到了一定的程度。可以自已及收。或者破壞而生瘝痕。或者他的内容軟化。生着顆粒的結膜。隨起脂肪變性。或玻璃様變性。外觀彷彿玻璃様或膠様。而有一種光澤。可以在臨床上，觀察砂眼起來。特别有幾種不同的名稱。（待續）</p>
<h3 id="c212">發熱普通治療法（一） <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>本篇所論是無論何種發熱病的治療法。按發熱二字英文爲Fever。這個發熱二字並不是任何一種疾病的專門名辭，不過是疾病的一種狀况。有很多種的疾病發熱。按照治療的原理醫治毛病應當對症治療。換一句話説就是治療發熱的原因。原因去掉了發熱自然會停止。這種原理應當特别注意。但是發熱與身體有極大的關係也不可不特别注意。比方熱度在一百零五度以上就很容易發生性命危險。我國人有病發熱了祗知道求醫師給他開點退熱藥以求敷衍了事。這種心理是不合乎新醫學原理的。在此有人要問爲什麽有病要發熱？現在拿一個繈喻來回答這個問題。我們都看見過拳術角力的。問兩個角力的人在角力時身體生熱出汗否？當然是生熱出汗的。那末，身體生病發熱也是一種理由。發熱的病是細菌侵入身體過見身體内的抵抗體（Antibodies）與白血球，細胞等發生戰爭。戰爭越急烈熱度發的越高。戰爭的結果，細菌勝了病人就要死了。身體的抵抗力勝了丨就是消滅了細菌，病就全愈了。故治療者對於這種戰爭應當盡力接濟身體的抵抗力：如同我們應當接濟援助我們自已的軍隊去消滅那侵略我們的敵人一様。在人身内的戰爭是一定要見勝負的；不像人類的戰爭有時可以調解和平了事的。</p>
<p>還有人要問，發熱到底與人身或病有益否？答，發熱如不過高是與身體有益的。比如，一個國家遇見敵人侵入便羣起禦敵竭全力驅逐敵人於境外自然可以保全自已的安寗。這就如一個人發熱一様。反之一個國家被敵人侵入不羣起熱烈應戰，則敵軍勢如破竹，國亡種滅立待。病人亦然，毒菌侵入身體内身體不能抵抗，毒菌得以猖獗病身將無以救藥。所以近年以來醫學家由研究與經騐已確知平常發熱不必特别怕，不過因發熱身體内新陳代謝的功用加增很多，我們必須供給身體抵抗的材料。人身如同一個機器。比如，一輛汽車走的快時必須多用汽油，機油，水等。一個人發熱到一百零五度時好像一輛汽車開足每小時走二百里一様。人身發熱又好像一個油燈，燈内如有油，燈心不會燒壞，但是一没有了油，燈心便要燒壞了。所以一個人發熱時供給他相當的材料，安置他在適宜的環境當中，發熱不至於呌他受特别害。茲舉一例：我在美國醫學時，我有一個同學患了傷寒病。他發熱了一個半月之久。因有相當的治療，等他病愈出醫院時，我看他，我很是詫異。怎麽様呢？就是他發了一個多月的熱兼腹瀉，出院時他的身體反比病前重了幾磅。這不過是醫學戰勝疾魔的一個例。</p>
<p>一個人發熱一度（華氏表）身内新陳代謝的作用就要加增白分之三十。如熱度加增六度（如由九十八度零六至一百零五度）身體内新陳代謝作用（消耗滋養料）就要加增一倍半。所以他必須從食物中得到這一倍半的滋養料他才能不損壞他身内的器官。</p>
<h3 id="c213">量温度法與説明 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>温度表有兩種。一種是華氏表。無病人的體温爲九十八度零十分之六。一種是百度表。無病人的體温爲三十七度。這些温度是在舌下量取的。温度表在舌下須放三分至五分鐘。兒童或神錯亂的人須將温度表置於肛門内三分鐘。肛門内體温較舌下高一度（華氏表）。有時亦可在腋下量取體温。此處較舌下低一度。</p>
<p>無病人的體温爲九八·六。早上或低一度左右。體温在九十九度以上便爲發熱。輕的發熱症大約一百至一百零二度。重的發熱度由一百零三至一百零五度。在一百零五度或一百零五以上病者多神志昏迷。一百零五以上隨時可以發生性命危險。身體特别强壯的人有時可以熱到一百零七度，不過到了這種熱度就是凶多吉少。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c214">爲批評着想 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 任白戈</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>批評是對於事物的一種意見。一個人，總不能對於事物没有意見，這就有了批評。</p>
<p>而且，批評是隨時隨地都存在着的。</p>
<p>一般，大多很喜歡將自已底意見表現出來。假使是能够運用筆墨的，那他們更要運用筆墨以一定的形式表現出來，讓它流傳得久遠一點吧。在這里，自然批評是存在着了。</p>
<p>有些人，雖然很不喜歡得自已底意見表現出來，往往只讓它在自已底心中陰消，也許批評更不容易從他們身上取着一定的形式表現出來吧，但他們對於事物須得有一種或取或舍的態度，而在這種態度之中便寓着起碼的批評，結果依然不能説是批評不存在着。</p>
<p>所以，我們一定可以這様的説：不管别人底承認或否認，批評終於是隨時隨地都存在着的。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>然而，我們底一部作家，他們只要一見着一點好像是批評的話，就很動氣地説：什麽鳥批評又來了！在他們底心中，批評之所以惡就在它使作家不能自由地創作，而他們之所以創作不出偉大的作品。也就是田於受了批評底拘束的緣故。所以，有些人甚至還特别爲批評家發明了一個套子，説這個套子就是批評家常常拿來裁判作品底（行）或（不行）的套子，彷彿只要這個套子一去他們就可以自由地創作出去十部偉大的作品一般。</p>
<p>結果呢，套子是去了，也許偉大的作品就會産生吧，然而，另外的一種好像是批評的話又來了。譬如説，許多人都在問一中國目前爲什麽没有偉大的作品産生？）那前提當然是説中國目前並没有偉大的作品，這不是一個很大的批評嗎？可見批評還是在存在着，只不過這種批評已經不是批評家的而是非批評家的罷了。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>在目前，我們是無法否認這種非批評家的批評底存在的。而且，我們還應該説這種非批評家的批評正在盛行：一種讀後感式的書報批評，我們是常常可以從一切報紙和雜誌上面見着的。假使我所遇着允個肯讀Ｂ報的青年的話，那他們一定會於談話之間説到某人底作品如何如何。還有，各色各様的座談會或茶話會乃至批評會亦在舉行着。這是很顯明的情形。</p>
<p>不過，這情形也許不容易長久。因爲一方面已經有人在説讀後感式的批評不是批評而不喜歡非批評家也有批評，一方面又有人在駡目前中國批評界底淺妄而將自已作爲一個批評家放在例外。這就是説：看情形，好像是目前淺妄的中國批評界一下就例外地出了幾個很（行）的批評家作出一些很（行）的批評來一直通行無阻，然而其實是將原有的這些非批評家的批評也一併去掉。因爲我們是不相信目前淺妄的批評界一下就可以例外地出幾個佷（行）的批評家作出一些很（行）的批評來一直通行無阻的。</p>
<p>爲什麽一定要將這些非批評家的批評也一併去掉呢？這可以説是各有用意不同：在那些駡目前中國批評界底淺妄而將自已作爲一個批評家放在例外的人，也許是爲了一時想得着獨賣的專利而未顧到將來會被連着批評一併去掉；但在一些説讀後感式的批評不是批評而不喜歡非批評家也有批評的人，却有設下一個陷阱使批評重入幾年前的命運的嫌疑。幾年前，又是有過許多所謂批評家底非讀後感式的批評嗎？我想這一些人，也許將來還有這麽的一着：凡是有點批評的人都封贈他爲批評家。這樣，隨着批評家之被一般人所否定，自然連那一點批評也被一般人所否定了。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>一切事物都是離不了批評的。而一切事物之所以有進步和發展，也就全靠着它本身就在批評。即使人夋没有自我批評的勇氣吧，外來的批評總是應該有相當的勇氣接受才好，蟡什麽我們底一部分作家偏要一見批評就憒怒呢？</p>
<p>自然，批評家底不行是個事實，但我們不能不希望有很行的批評家出現。批評家並不是一下就很行了的，也許我們不能在一些不行的批評家中間找得一點並非不行的批評，但我們不能不希望有很行的批評出現。那末，所謂很行的批評家和批評又日從那裏來的呢？這，首先我們就得明白批評家與讀者是不能分開的：第一，批評家也是一個讀者：第二，讀者才是最大的批評家，只要明白了這一點，那我們底作家們便會和批評握手了。</p>
<p>我以爲作家是應該和批評好好握乎的，即使批評家底批評不行吧，那也得暫時珍重着一般讀者底意見，而這也就是須私批評握乎的原因。</p>
<p>一切很行的批評家和批評，都是可以從讀者中問出來的。</p>

<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>汕頭呵，我的故鄉，</p>
<p>是一個没有冬天的港口。廣東的第二個都市。灰黔的面相，罪惡的底裏，和患着都市畸形病。</p>
<p>我厭惡這個黑暗的都市，我却也眷念這個風光明媚的南國的故鄉。</p>
<p>是八年之前吧，我在一個故國的動亂和恐怖的早晨從這個港口被吐出去了：又在八年之後，我却又在一個晚霞映的金色的黄昏的時候被這個港口吸入去了。丨丨像一切都市對於人和貨物的呑吐一様，我被吐出來又被吸進去，被吸進去又被吐出來。在一個動亂的世代裏，一個小小的人也像一片木片捲在旋渦裏般地，跟着動亂的。</p>
<p>雖然我曾在這個故鄉的港口停留了幾個時候，我對於這個港口的印象却是糢糊的。我不能明悉牠像明悉新加坡，我也不能了解牠像了解上海。</p>
<p>然而我憎惡這個都市：因爲牠啜吸着農民們的血汗，從這個都市的血管裏牠把這輸送紅毛鬼子。海關前的貨棧成隹堆，苦力們的勞聲不息，輪船上吐着黑烟，而農民們在田間忍饑嘆息。</p>
<p>當世界受着不景氣的打擊的時候，農村裏哀鴻遍野，農民迫而走險。於是富人們羣聚汕頭，華僑帶着資金回國。土地曾因是漲價，娱樂塲所和奢侈品却突然高增。當着都市正在努力肅清和驅逐源源而來的游民和乞丐的時候，同時汕頭之夜却在徵歌和狂賭的聲中。汕頭的肚腹是空虚的，然而汕頭的媚臉却不能不塗上脂粉：汕頭的脚已經是患着軟癱病的，然而那架在軟脚之上的搖搖欲堕的軀幹却還在傲意驕人。可恥的面相呵，這便是我的故鄉！</p>
<p>然而汕頭本來却值不得這般被鄙薄的。你看媽嶼外的白浪滔滔，媽嶼口却永恒地用着她那薄薄的細口和櫻唇微笑地歡迎那漂泊在外歸來的游子。　石山上的黑石嶙峋，山峯現着一個鮮紅的春天的歡笑。海上漁民無數，撤着黑色的收穫之綱；陸地上稻田金黄，臘月裏廣大的原野上還掛着金紅色的柑子累累。在金黄色的黄昏，農田裏佈滿着的是勤勞的大地之子；在靜朗的朝晨，汕頭也響关那建造大地的工人們的鐵錘之聲。汕頭是在黑暗裏現着曙光的。</p>
<p>汕頭呵，我的故鄉！</p>

<p>人是寂寞的，花也是寂寞的。</p>
<p>近來自家是冷淡得連想到花的心情都不大有。阿雲以爲我太寂寞了，供點花來調劑調劑生活的枯寂味也是必需的。承他的情，特地給我送來一束白色的康納馨，寂寞的花。</p>
<p>（寂寞的花，白色的康納馨，憂鬱的蒼白型的姑娘啊！）</p>
<p>可眞缺乏興緻呢。寂寞的花，還是讓它寂寞地開着寂寞地萎謝罷。自家底花一様的青春不也是這麽寂寞地度過了麽？我們這個世界本來就都是寂寞的呵！不是嗎？</p>
<p>洗出個瓶來養着它，把來供在臥室的窓前就算完事了。要是在有好月亮的清夜，幽光悠悠地瀉進來，浴在幽陰的光輝裏，白色的康納馨會偷偷地笑着清潤的月色的。沉醋在這澹永的意境中，凝望着綴滿了星星的夜空，寂寞的祝福便輕微地從嘴裏漏出來了：</p>
<p>（主呵，請悲憫這一羣寂寞的靈魂罷。雖然他們是没有快樂，也没有苦難，但也只得這麽忍受下去麽？······）</p>
<p>人也跟花一様凄凉地笑了，可含着涙珠呢。</p>
<p>接連幾日都是這様的。帶着惺忪的睡味醒來的，室仙便漾着一縷清永的香味，迎着晨風，那束康納馨已經開得很盛了。丨丨夏底姿態呢，夏啊！</p>
<p>欹在窓前，讓我頌讚這靜穆的朝晨罷。</p>
<p>禮拜堂的鐘聲溶在曉霧裏飄揚着呢，白色的康納馨垂下頭來了。太陽的觸乎撫着它；中世紀修道院裏的童貞女俯在神前受洗禮的意象畫呵。</p>
<p>（寂寞的花，白色的康納馨，憂鬰的蒼白型的姑娘···········啊！）</p>
<p>人是容易老的，花是容易殘的，雖然是一束寂寞地開着的花，可也不容許它佔有幾多的風光呢。</p>
<p>花落了。·····</p>
<p>素潔的康納馨萎落在一地，窓口那兒的風流進來，吹着幾莖褪色的枝葉，簌簌地響着寂寞的聲音，寂寞地開寂寞地謝的寂寞的花喲：</p>
<p>（夏天的季節過去了。）</p>
<p>欷歔着，悄悄地檢起萎落在地上的花瓣，用紫色的絲絹包着，藏在口袋裏。我要用我寂寞的心來温暖這些寂寞的殘英；明年仍有個夏天呢。</p>

<p>Already on the Path to Resolution</p>
<p>Tao Shangming Went to Tianjin Yesterday to Negotiate</p>
<p>Chai Mountain Hosted a Banquet for Key Chinese and Japanese Figures</p>
<p>Regulations for the Organization of the War Zone Readjustment Committee Are Being Drafted</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Miyakoshi Incident involving the Japanese merchant Miyakoshi in Malan峪, after negotiations initiated by the Japanese side, has, through the efforts of the Hebei Provincial Government, entered a path to resolution. It is still being processed and a result is expected within one or two days. Tao Shangming left for Tianjin this morning to assist in handling everything. The head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Yuguan, Ii, left Beiping this morning on the newly opened Ping-Shen train to return to Yuguan. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The selection of members for the War Zone Readjustment Committee and its organizational regulations, after discussions among various parties, have been submitted to the Political Readjustment Council for instructions from the central government. Upon receiving approval from the central government, the organization and establishment will commence. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The resolution of the Miyakoshi Incident in Yutian is not far off. Yu Xuezhong is scheduled to come to Beiping in one or two days to meet with Huang, reporting on the progress of negotiations with the Japanese side in Tianjin. Yin Rugeng stated that the main culprit in the case, Wu Runbi, has been ordered to be strictly arrested by the provincial government and will likely be captured soon. The reason for Yu's delayed arrival is believed to be his ongoing negotiations with the Japanese in Tianjin, with Yin assisting by his side under orders. If Yu cannot come to Beiping, Yin will go to Tianjin within days to seek instructions on everything. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong, Li Zeyi, Tao Shangming, Yin Rugeng, and others have been discussing the organizational regulations of the War Zone Readjustment Committee in detail for days. They are currently drafting them. Once a clean copy is made, it will be presented to Huang for review. After Huang's revisions, it will be submitted to the Political Readjustment Council for approval at a general meeting before it can be finalized. The War Zone Readjustment Committee can then begin organizing according to the organizational regulations and determine the date of establishment. Rumors that the committee will be established on the first day are premature. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chai Mountain hosted a banquet at the Japanese Embassy last night for key Chinese and Japanese military and political figures. Those present included Yin Tong, Li Zeyi, Tao Shangming, Yin Rugeng, Zhu Shiqin, Ii, and a certain Japanese major general, among more than twenty people. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Luan-Yu Administrative Commissioner Tao Shangming arrived in Tianjin from Beiping at 11:30 AM today and immediately went to the provincial government to meet with Yu Xuezhong, reporting on the progress made in Beiping by Huang Fu, Yin Tong, and Yin Rugeng in resolving issues concerning the war zone. He sought Yu Xuezhong's opinion. At 5:00 PM this evening, Tao Shangming visited Japanese Consul Tanaka, continuing discussions about the Qian'an issue. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming took the Ping-Shen train to Tianjin on the 30th morning to meet with Yu Xuezhong to discuss the Miyakoshi case. After completing the matter, he immediately returned to Tangshan. The War Zone Readjustment Committee was originally scheduled to be established on the 1st, but due to the need to revise the organizational regulations, it was decided to postpone the establishment until after the Political Readjustment Council held a general meeting.

<p>Have Collapsed Beyond the Great Wall Line</p>
<p>Rumors Say They Will Reorganize and Attack Again</p>
<p>Part of Them Intends to Flee to Baodi and Sanhe Counties</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The bandits occupying the area bordering Jixian, Yutian, and Wu Duli Cliff, were fiercely attacked on the 29th by Sun Jizhou, the captain of the Yutian Security Reinforcement Team, leading his troops, along with the Yutian County Magistrate Chen Baosheng's supervised militia. After several hours of intense fighting, the bandits were unable to withstand and collapsed beyond the Great Wall line. They spread rumors that they would reorganize and attack again, so the militias of Zunhua, Yutian, and Jixian remain on high alert. Zhang Renli, the Fengrun County Magistrate, reorganized the county's militia into five major detachments, each adopting the principle of "purifying the ranks" and implementing military training, under the direct command of Magistrate Zhang, to prevent banditry within the war zone.

<p>(Tianjin) The village of Sanletaicun in northern Zunhua was occupied by bandits. Although they have been driven back by the militia and police, the entire village was looted by the bandits, and the houses are in ruins. All two hundred households in the village are destitute. The villages of Daquanzhuang and Baitasong have also suffered severely from bandit looting and arson. The refugees, after the bandits left, are without homes and food. Shen Zhongyue, the Zunhua County Magistrate, and Chen Baosheng, the Yutian County Magistrate, have sent a special telegram to the province requesting disaster relief and exemption from the 24th-year land tax for the affected villages.

<p>(Tianjin) Bandits are secretly thriving in the Kailuan East and West Mines, and kidnappings are occurring repeatedly. On the afternoon of the 29th, when Zhao Gezhuang workers were leaving work, five bandits waited outside the mine entrance and, upon seeing worker Li Deshan leaving, pretended to be collecting debts from Li, and took him away with a pistol. Although the miners witnessed this, they did not dare to resist and allowed him to be taken away. Due to the frequent appearances of bandits, residents of the mining workers' residences have relocated elsewhere. The Tangshan Public Security Bureau and the Second Security Team of the War Zone are on special alert. Zhao Lei also ordered two companies from the First Battalion of his troops to station in Guye to prevent banditry. Zhao Xun, the Chief of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, returned to Tangshan after inspecting the Dongsikuang. He stated that although there are rumors of reactionary plots and banditry at Dongsikuang, the authorities have a detailed plan, and even if something happens, it will not escalate. The bandits in the mining areas will soon be suppressed. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

The security teams and militias of the two counties are on high alert, ready to launch a fierce attack when the bandits approach the county borders. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) Military News: The remnants of the bandits in Suian recently fled from Hengyan to occupy Baojia Village, relying on the terrain and constructing fortifications to prevent pursuit. At 1:00 PM on the 24th, the directly subordinate troops of Wang's Brigade and a certain regiment pursued to the vicinity of Hongjiashan and engaged the bandits in contact. After a short period of intense fighting, the bandits feigned defeat and retreated, luring our army to go deep. Wang's Brigade had long seen through the ruse and only used a small number of officers and soldiers to pursue the bandits from the front, while the main force secretly advanced from the mountains and forests on both sides. When the bandits' ambushing troops rose up, they were met with a fierce attack. The battle continued until 6:00 PM, by which time the main force of the bandits had been broken, and they fled in disarray towards Hongshangang. In this battle, a certain regiment captured four mountain tops in succession, killing hundreds of bandits and capturing dozens.

Seeing that our officers and soldiers were brave, they reluctantly fought until 4:00 AM before giving way and fleeing in disarray towards Dalianling. The regiment ultimately occupied Hongshangang and Baojia Village in succession. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e11">The League of Nations Suspends Sending Technical Liaison Officers and Our Country's Independent Development <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Rajchman, who previously served as the League of Nations Technical Cooperation Liaison Officer in China, was recently reappointed as the Chief of the League of Nations Health Section. The Committee on Technical Cooperation with China has also decided not to appoint a replacement for Rajchman. However, it has also requested the League of Nations Secretariat to take necessary measures to continue the development of various technical cooperation projects.</p>
<p>I remember that when the Chinese government sent a note to the League of Nations Council on June 28th of last year, it earnestly hoped that the League of Nations would recommend a technical expert to be sent to China as a representative of technical cooperation between the two parties. As a result, the Committee on Technical Cooperation appointed Rajchman on July 18th. Rajchman's term was set for one year and has long since expired. However, the issue of his successor had already attracted attention from all parties before the end of his term. Originally, China's request for a liaison officer came after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, which caused Japan to feel extremely panicked. Japan regarded Rajchman as "an extremely anti-Japanese person" and launched a major attack on him.</p>
<p>Based on the League of Nations' past stance towards Japan, we do not believe that the reason why Rajchman was not reappointed as the liaison officer in China was an indication of the League of Nations' capitulation to Japan. Since Rajchman took office as liaison officer, the position of Chief of the Health Section he left behind was not inherited by a fellow countryman. Therefore, some people believe that this was not only his personal sacrifice but also his country's (Poland) sacrifice. It is also possible that Rajchman had previously declared to the committee that he had no intention of continuing to work in China. However, the League of Nations has many talented people, and if Rajchman was not appointed, someone else could have been appointed. Why was the position of liaison officer temporarily left vacant? Everyone is skeptical about this point, believing that the future of technical cooperation between the two parties may be affected as a result. Especially after China failed to compete for a non-permanent seat on the Council of the League of Nations, it feels that this move by the League of Nations may increase the disappointment of the Chinese people and even have a meaning of capitulation to Japan.</p>
<p>However, our observation is different. First, according to the League of Nations' new budget proposal for 1935, the liaison expenses for China total 450,000 gold francs, which includes the expenses for technical cooperation. This is solid proof that the League of Nations is happy to continue cooperation with China. Second, the League of Nations had previously made it clear to Japan that Japan had no right to interfere in the matter of technical cooperation. We do not see any new facts or reasons occurring that would change its old attitude. Moreover, if the League of Nations really succumbed to Japan, it would have to abandon the entire matter of technical cooperation. Whether or not to send a liaison officer to China is a minor issue in comparison. Even Japan's initial opposition to Rajchman was still in opposition to technical cooperation.</p>
<p>It was just using the opposition to Rajchman as an excuse to vent its anger.</p>
<p>So, what is the reason for not sending a successor to Rajchman this time? As outsiders, we can only seek answers within the scope of reason. As a result, the answer we got is that the need for a liaison officer has indeed decreased.</p>
<p>When China initially requested the League of Nations to send a liaison officer in April 1931, it stated that "the duration of the officer's stay in China will be determined by the actual needs and the convenience of the Chinese government." This point was accepted by the League of Nations. Now, if we want to ask why the need for a liaison officer is indeed less than before, we must pay attention to the content of the four responsibilities of the liaison officer decided by the Committee on Technical Cooperation on July 18th of last year. The reason why the liaison officer needs to be stationed in China is almost entirely based on the fourth responsibility, which is "to assist the National Economic Council in coordinating the activities of experts from various technical agencies of the League of Nations on the spot." In other words, if the activities of various experts in China decrease, the need for a liaison officer stationed in China will also decrease or even disappear. Since Rajchman returned to Europe, there are still more than ten experts sent by the League of Nations serving in China. However, their contract period is one year and is about to expire. It is said that the NEC will retain only a few of them and will not continue to hire the rest. Everyone is preparing to return home. The actual trend is like this, so it is no wonder that the Committee on Technical Cooperation recently made the decision not to send a liaison officer.</p>
<p>After most of the foreign experts are dismissed, who will continue their work is also worth studying. According to our observation, the government seems to have a clear plan for this. If the observation is correct, it is worthy of praise. Among the six measures agreed upon between China and the League of Nations regarding technical cooperation, there is a clause that obliges the League of Nations to "train Chinese staff." Rajchman also said in his report that "the number of experts sent to China should be as small as possible." "The effectiveness of foreign experts working in China is limited." On the contrary, he praised the Chinese experts, believing that they are rare talents. We have always admired Rajchman's enlightened attitude. After reading his report, our faith in the ability of domestic experts has also increased. Now that the NEC has prepared to dismiss the foreign experts whose terms have expired, it is also cooperating with the Ministry of Education to establish a National Academic Work Advisory Office to give priority to recruiting domestic technical personnel. All kinds of measures contain the meaning of revising the method of technical cooperation. This point was understood in advance between China and the League of Nations. The Ministry of Education has also expressed hope for cooperation from the League of Nations Cultural Cooperation Committee regarding the Academic Work Advisory Office and similar organizations.</p>
<p>Analyzing from various aspects, we believe that the reason why the League of Nations Committee on Technical Cooperation does not send a liaison officer to China is mostly influenced by China's revised policy. However, the suspension of sending a liaison officer is not enough to hinder the future of cooperation between China and the League of Nations. We must know that the scope of cooperation between the two parties is very wide, and even the so-called technical and health cooperation cannot be fully covered by simply sending a few experts to China. The ultimate goal of the League of Nations is to support the ability of the Chinese to take on technical construction on their own. Of course, we also extremely hope that China can build independently. However, the most lacking thing for Chinese technical experts is the experience of handling affairs in foreign countries. The NEC must create more of these opportunities for them, and then they can use them to replace foreign experts and be competent and happy.</p>

<p>(Moscow) News from Harbin states that the Soviet Consul stationed in Manzhouli received a report that the Russian citizen Shablin司基氏, the station master of Manzhouli Station, has been subjected to torture since his arrest and imprisonment, and his life is in danger. The Consul requested permission to visit Shablin, but the local Diplomatic Office refused, using the excuse that Shablin's case had not yet been fully investigated. It is believed that the authorities are trying to use this excuse to prevent the above news from being confirmed and to conceal their cruel treatment of the arrested personnel. The Consul has repeatedly requested the Office to conduct a thorough investigation into Shablin's prison life. (30th TASS dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The French government, in order to protect the French investment in the Russian-Asian Bank era of the Chinese Eastern Railway, has requested the Soviet and Japanese governments to reserve the right to claim old debts.

It is a mistake to request Japan to reserve the debts. (30th Den-Tsu dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Wind Disaster</p>
<h3 id="e14">Army Losses of Tens of Millions <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Government Maintained Reliance on Self-Relief for Osaka</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The army's damage from the wind disaster, encompassing the barracks and other facilities under the jurisdiction of the Osaka, Himeji, Hiroshima, Kyoto, and Zentsuji divisions, will exceed ten million yuan. Minister of the Army Hayashi departed from Tokyo Station westward at 9:00 PM last night to inspect the extent of the damage. During the journey, the Minister strongly advocated the necessity of establishing a dedicated Colonial Affairs Minister. (30th Dispatch from the Den Tsushin)</p>
<p>The Osaka Prefectural government has requested the following amount of reconstruction funds for small and medium-sized businesses from the central government: (1) 40 million yuan for small and medium-sized industrialists. The estimated damage to small and medium-sized industries is approximately 70 million yuan, but about 45% of them are capable of raising funds independently. Therefore, more than 50% require relief. (2) 22 million yuan for small and medium-sized merchants. Approximately 22,000 small and medium-sized merchants require relief due to flooded and collapsed houses. It is estimated that the average damage to goods and buildings per household is ten yuan, totaling about 62 million yuan. The Osaka Prefectural government hopes that the central government will compensate for the losses in a new form. (30th Dispatch from the Den Tsushin)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although the Ministry of Finance's countermeasures for the temporary parliament have not yet been concretely decided, it is focusing on the wind disaster in the Kansai region, especially on the reconstruction of small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises. It intends to ease the financing of funds from the Deposit Bureau to promote self-reliance and regeneration. Therefore, it is strictly preventing the expansion of supplementary budgets, only recognizing emergency expenses and leaving the rest to the regular parliament. This seems to be its predetermined policy. However, each ministry will propose a considerable amount of supplementary budget for wind disaster relief countermeasures. Considering the experience of the Great Earthquake, emergency expenses of nearly 130 million yuan were spent, and much of it was wasted on unnecessary items. With the lessons of the past in mind, this time, the government will strictly scrutinize the digestion capacity of public bonds and the strengthening of fiscal content. Not only that, but also for the damage in rural areas, every expenditure related to military expenses should avoid duplication with the budget of the tenth year, and efforts must be made to reduce it. At the same time, depending on the amount of revenue, there may be different circumstances for the Kansai region affected by the wind disaster. In general, it is necessary to consider deferring the collection of land rent, the third type of income tax, business revenue tax, and liquor tax. It is said that they are currently rushing to implement specific measures. (30th Dispatch from the Nichiren)</p>
<p>Osaka Recently, Minister of Commerce Machida, who went west, requested various business groups to find ways to relieve the wind disaster. According to his remarks, the cabinet has decided to convene a temporary parliament as soon as possible, but because the budget preparation takes time, it is not convenient to convene it within October and it will be postponed until November. However, in this situation, emergency countermeasures will definitely not be timely, and it is hoped that appropriate measures can be taken. Currently, the Deposit Bureau can provide low-interest funds, but the government cannot directly lend to the commercial and industrial sectors. If the losses are to be guaranteed by the government, it requires the approval of the parliament. Judging from this situation, it will take considerable time. However, if the prefectural and city governments can find a way to provide immediate financing without government guarantee of losses, it would be the best method. The amount of financing that can be provided is not yet clear, but if necessary, it will be fully supplied. Osaka is a large city with strong inherent power, and I deeply believe that it will be able to seek recovery through its own efforts in this disaster, he said. (30th Dispatch from the Nichiren)</p>

<p>Polish President Issues Order</p>
<h3 id="e17">Implementing National Conscription <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Healthy Men and Women Must Serve in the Military</p>
<p>Unpredictable Treaty Relationships</p>
<p>Warsaw Polish President Moscicki issued an emergency order today, implementing conscription. All healthy men and women in the country must enlist. Men aged 17 to 60 and women aged 19 to 45 must serve in the military. Even women who are mothers must serve if they are physically fit. There are very few exemptions. The conscription system includes what is called military support positions, which include transportation units, poison gas air defense units, fire brigades, health teams, and transportation teams. The most important function of this newly formed army is of course during times of war and mobilization, but it also has its uses in peacetime. Poland, like other European countries, is striving to prepare for the unexpected. Franco-Polish relations have been quite cold for a year. Although Polish diplomats have signed non-aggression treaties with Germany and Russia this year, the German-Polish treaty was signed in January of this year and is valid for ten years. The Russian-Polish treaty will expire in May next year, and if the two countries do not declare it void at that time, it will continue to be valid for another two years. However, Poland is well aware that such treaties can become waste paper at any time. Therefore, in the past six months, Poland has established a standing army of more than 250,000 people and will begin training a million-strong army within a few weeks. French military engineering experts have been guiding the construction of strong fortresses throughout the border. The Polish people feel quite uneasy in this environment. Although the German-Polish treaty is said to be valid for ten years, politicians believe that Poland cannot avoid being the gunpowder keg of Eastern Europe, because the Polish people are convinced that Germany will not stop until it obtains Poland's (corridor) and merges East Prussia with Germany.

<p>Poland Opposes Eastern European Pact</p>
<h3 id="e18">France is Anxious About It <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>About to Question Poland on the Future of the Alliance</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the Geneva correspondent of the "Xinwen Bao" disclosed the contents of Poland's recent note regarding the Eastern European Pact, there has been considerable anxiety here. According to the "Xinwen Bao," Poland's note, at first glance, seems to suggest that Poland is willing to accept the Eastern European Pact under certain conditions. However, upon closer examination of its contents, it is felt that the Polish government's actions are entirely dictated by Germany. Without Germany's participation, Poland is unwilling to take any independent action. Poland has no intention of violating the newly signed German-Polish agreement in January and insists that the German-Polish agreement be included in the Eastern European Pact and become an inseparable part of it. Poland also firmly stated that it is unwilling to sign mutual assistance agreements with countries with which Poland has no diplomatic relations. This is clearly directed at Lithuania. In addition, Poland is unwilling to assume any responsibility for Czechoslovakia and declared that it has absolutely no interest in the Danube River issue. The "Xinwen Bao" concludes that the French government will soon question Poland about whether there have been any changes in the Polish diplomatic policy regarding the future of the Franco-Polish alliance.

<p>Sofia King Alexander of Yugoslavia, accompanied by the Queen and Foreign Minister Yevtich, recently came here to discuss issues related to the two countries with King Boris of Bulgaria and Prime Minister Georgiev. After the meeting, a communiqué was issued stating that both sides decided to promote economic relations between the two countries and simplify various transit procedures to make transportation between the two countries more developed. At 11:00 AM this morning, the King of Yugoslavia, accompanied by the Queen and Yevtich, set off to return to their country. King Boris, the Queen, and government officials all went to the station to see them off. (30th Dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>Sofia The official visit of the King and Queen of Yugoslavia to Bulgaria has lasted for two days. The monarchs and foreign ministers of the two countries have met and talked for days, and the atmosphere has been extremely harmonious. The enhancement of relations between the two countries has truly paved the way. When the monarchs of the two countries toasted each other, they all looked forward to the friendship and cooperation between the two countries. This is not only emotional language, but has also further become a political trend. (29th Dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers are full of news of the King of Yugoslavia's visit to the capital of Bulgaria. The cordial reception of Bulgaria and the earnestness of the talks between the heads of state have been noted by the newspapers. The press generally believes that the feelings between the two countries have been further improved as a result. Moreover, the French Foreign Minister is about to go to Italy to meet with the Italian Prime Minister, but before Barthou has set off, there has already been diplomatic activity between Berlin, Warsaw, and Sofia. This has also been noted by the newspapers. The Egyptian "West" newspaper commented on the visit of Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös to Warsaw, saying that Gömbös's move is pleasing because it will make the relations between Poland and Hungary increasingly friendly. However, the visit of the German Minister to Austria, Papen, to the Hungarian capital makes it impossible to avoid doubts about the nature and significance of the negotiations between Warsaw and the Hungarian capital. The Rome correspondent of the "Morning Post"电 reported that, according to well-informed sources, Germany is now making diplomatic efforts to prevent German-Italian relations from being too affected by the Franco-Italian approach, and it is rumored that the German Ribbentrop will meet with the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini before Barthou arrives in Rome.

<p>Encompassing Politics, Military Affairs, and Economics</p>
<p>France Underwrites Italian Securities Worth Two Million</p>
<p>Rome Today, it was learned that the political and military agreement between Italy and France has expanded its scope to include economic and financial issues. Therefore, the two countries have practically combined to become a kind of Central European peaceful dictatorship. The National Bank of France has agreed to underwrite Italian securities worth two million lire. This agreement, which can be signed in Geneva soon, will completely change the lines of European powers after the combination of Italy and France. The ideal theory of disarmament will be replaced by a realized system of peaceful dictatorship. It is said that the Franco-Italian agreement will not have many problems with the Little Entente countries. The diplomatic community believes that the Danube River countries will therefore broaden their horizons, and the result will make it easier for them to realize their wishes. The points currently stipulated in the Franco-Italian agreement are as follows: (1) Naval equality; (2) Armed forces equality; (3) Jointly refuse German rearmament; and (4) Implement political cooperation on international affairs. Italian and French politicians all expect that the Little Entente countries will eventually join. If so, the resolutions of the countries participating in the agreement will have the backing of 1.5 million standing troops. The beginning of the combination of Italy and France was due to Germany's recent actions in Austria and the failure of the disarmament conference. (30th Dispatch from the Kuomin)</p>

<p>Vienna Today, rumors are rife, saying that the Home Guard is planning to revolt because they are dissatisfied with their current position and fear that they will be disbanded. The Home Guard is a semi-military organization, very similar to the German National Socialist Party and the Italian Blackshirts. It was established several years ago, and its leader is the current Deputy Prime Minister Prince Starhemberg. After being recognized by the government, it became an auxiliary police organization. It made great contributions to the government during the Social Democratic Party uprising in February and the National Socialist Party rebellion in July. (30th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>

The memorial service was held in St. Stephen's Cathedral. President Miklas, Prime Minister Schuschnigg, other government ministers, and the diplomatic corps all attended in person. After the memorial service, the coffins of the two former prime ministers were placed in a hearse pulled by eight black horses, led by the Presidential Guard cavalry, and transported to the Seipel and Dollfuss church for burial.

<p>Spain</p>
<h3 id="e23">Cabinet Fate Uncertain <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Parliament May Be Dissolved</p>
<p>Madrid The Spanish political situation is repeating the cycle of events. The history of a year ago is now being repeated. It is still remembered that when the House of Representatives adjourned at the end of September 1933 and held a meeting, the Lerroux cabinet began to embark on the path of reliance. At that time, the theory of dissolving the House of Representatives was all the rage. Now, at the end of September 1934, the political situation is exactly the same as it was a year ago. The Samper cabinet has only been established for five months, and its fate is already precarious due to the reopening of the House of Representatives. Newspapers are also spreading rumors of dissolving the House of Representatives. As for whether the current cabinet is about to collapse, observers often hold different opinions. Some people have always doubted the cabinet's overthrow, believing that the current cabinet can pass the budget bill through the House of Representatives. However, there are very few people who make this kind of speculation. Llopis, the leader of the Acción Popular party, which advocates Pan-Hispanism, clearly announced in Catalonia that the party had decided to stop supporting the current government and was prepared to directly participate in the government. Llopis's opinion has not changed so far. As for the Agrarian Party and the Monarchist Party, they are even more dissatisfied with the Samper cabinet due to the Catalonian land issue. Judging from this, when the House of Representatives meets tomorrow, the cabinet can only rely on the eighty votes of the Radical Party and some other independent members. The Spanish House of Representatives has a total of 459 members, so it is very difficult to obtain a majority. Unless new facts occur (such as those related to public order), the development of the political tide seems to be predictable. As for the proposal to dissolve the House of Representatives, it is mostly seen in the left-wing newspapers. The right-wing believes that this is a movement to oppose the constitutional procedure for resolving the cabinet tide. In short, if the cabinet is overthrown, it will be very difficult to resolve the political tide. Unless Lerroux, the former Prime Minister of the Radical Party, resumes his post as Prime Minister, any new cabinet does not seem to be able to obtain the support of the Radical Party. However, it is rumored by the government that President Zamora's friendship with Lerroux has greatly diminished due to various facts before the cabinet tide occurred in April of this year. In this case, it is very unlikely that Lerroux will form a cabinet. In addition, some people said that Llopis of the right-wing Acción Popular party requested to select four seats in the cabinet and give them to his political friends. Although the Acción Popular party, which has extreme right-wing tendencies, has repeatedly announced that it is willing to accept the political system chosen by public opinion, it has never been heard that the party members clearly announced that they are republicans. In this case, can President Zamora tolerate the placement of such people in the cabinet's internal affairs, army, and agriculture departments? And if Llopis's faction joins the new cabinet, the left-wing and socialist congressmen will vote against it. It can be further asserted that if President Zamora considers this, it is a big question whether he can accept Llopis's request. Although the answers to various questions cannot be given at present, if the cabinet tide cannot be resolved, then it is difficult to avoid another dissolution of the Spanish parliament.

<p>(Washington) Observers today predict that President Roosevelt's broadcast speech tomorrow will lack the (confident) tone desired by business and financial leaders, because Roosevelt cannot yet allow temporary spending to be reduced or (New Deal) experiments to be abandoned. It is heard that the President is well aware that some aspects have been damaged, but these damaged aspects are actually a small number of people who use the majority of the weak to damage the country. Observers say that Roosevelt's unwillingness to give (confident) speeches is in stark contrast to the (recovery is imminent) that the previous President often claimed. Hoover also had to abandon this kind of (confident) speech, because after each speech, the stock market would fall sharply. On the contrary, despite the requests from all parties, Roosevelt does not want to speak optimistically. He sometimes even warns people not to be too optimistic too early, saying that the United States still needs to work hard before it can recover. (29th Dispatch from the Kuomin)</p>

Foley said that the jurors will probably be local gentlemen. The police department stated that the crime of receiving ransom has been conclusively proven, but the murder charge has not yet been filed. It is also heard that the authorities are preparing to interrogate a woman named Mary, because she talked about the Lindbergh kidnapping case for hours before the reason for Hauptmann's arrest was announced.

<p>Labor Minister Discusses</p>
<h3 id="e33">Labor Relief Measures <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>University Students Get Close to Workers</p>
<p>Farmers Get Close to City Dwellers</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Berlin Special Dispatch, September 23rd) The German unemployment problem has been effectively relieved through measures taken by the Ministry of Labor. A reporter interviewed Labor Minister Scheldt about labor relief measures. According to his discussion, all human systems have been in constant change for nearly a century. Therefore, amidst this global unemployment crisis, we must find ways to provide relief. The causes of unemployment are numerous and varied, with some being common to all countries and others being unique. Some may be due to the special circumstances of a particular country, leading to unemployment panic. However, the root cause of unemployment is not the most important thing; rather, we must observe the facts and seek solutions and ways out with a clear vision. How can we provide relief and eliminate the source of the disaster?</p>
<p>In Germany (or perhaps not only Germany), as in other countries, there is ongoing discussion of comprehensive methods to prevent youth unemployment and restore customs, order, and social peace after the end of the Great War. Everyone is linked to the nation, and everyone has patriotic ideas, which gives the German government a strong backing in this situation. Currently, there are a total of 250,000 workers in Germany, who are working together to create wealth for the country. Everyone has a fundamental idea of promoting industry, which is very beneficial to the national economy and order. From a humanitarian point of view, let's briefly discuss this. We must properly arrange everything. We must improve the lives of workers so that all workers do not perish and die. Rescue the youth, but the people of the country are not very clear about this, only knowing that this matter is terrible. Recently, the Implementation Committee of the Geneva Disarmament Conference has discussed the issue of labor relief, using formal methods to rescue German youth. Because the important issue of labor relief starts with education and personality, and social conditions must be paid attention to first. We should not only discuss it in terms of Germany, but should extend it to all countries, and France must not misunderstand it. The German government has no despicable views, and does not use labor relief to seek to enrich military equipment. If you do not believe it, you can go to Germany to see and know that Germany is dedicated to solving the difficulties of the labor sector, and there are no other military purposes, it is for the workers to serve. Therefore, labor relief is not malicious, but to save unemployed youth, so that the German people will not be in chaos in the future.</p>
<p>If we want to talk about relieving labor in Germany, we must first seek good methods, which must be suitable for the character of German youth and the entire German national character. The best thing we can do is to refer to the past experience of various countries, such as referring to the methods of Bulgaria, because their country is also in difficulty, rescuing all labor circles. If we can participate in the labor relief methods of various countries to relieve the unemployed people in Germany, then in the future German youth will have a ray of hope. Now no one in the world can realize this hope with the methods of human ethics and justice. In this difficulty, people of all classes should discuss ways together, take joint responsibility, cooperate and serve the people, and lead young people into the norms of righteousness and etiquette. All university students should also approach manual workers and workers, farmers should approach city dwellers, the learned should approach the unlearned, and the ignorant should be created to serve others. Everyone should do their best, provide free relief, avoid class conflicts, and avoid the death of people. Under the leadership of Hitler, eliminate class struggles, because society is different, it is appropriate to jointly relieve unemployment, and surpassing the contradictory thinking of class struggles is the supreme method. All people created by God should coexist and prosper.</p>
<p>If our main goal is to relieve the good order and education of the labor sector, if so, there should be no risk of failure. The national economy is what we should strive for, and the focus is on relieving labor, so it does not compete with the individual economy. The situation in various countries today is very clear. There can be no good results and methods on the path of a free individual economy, nor can the problem of the national economy be solved. The individual economy cannot relieve the unemployment problem, or completely solve the unemployment problem, it only belongs to the private ownership of entrepreneurs. For example, opening up wasteland, irrigating fields, such as opening up roads and other enterprises, is beneficial to the public and everyone can take it and use it unconditionally. However, in the autumn of crisis and survival, the individual economy should not be put in a dangerous situation, and we should not despise it. The individual economy has its own meaning for the country. When the country changes from a non-terrorist state to a terrorist state, or when it is reorganizing streets and facilitating traffic, when the highway is not developed, the individual economy can build everything for the country. Labor relief can be freely worked according to the rules, and the strength of thousands of people must be gathered to work together. Under this situation, it is appropriate to solve or use unused labor force directly in the aspect of free relief, use production methods to sell surplus goods, and the individual economy is the first to start labor undertakings, and always help people have the opportunity to obtain work, but sometimes the individual economy also publicly destroys labor undertakings, and various countries and government agencies pay close attention to this, because the individual economy cannot directly have the ability to produce. Now is not the time for the country to take this opportunity to implement a large economic plan. If the country wants to encourage public enterprises at present, it cannot be delayed. The government of the German Republic is implementing this principle wholeheartedly. Everyone can freely relieve labor, and the results will be considerable. I guarantee in the name of the Minister of Labor that our leader Hitler will be able to bravely implement the cause of labor relief.</p>

Wang Zhanyuan, the captain of the 3rd Brigade of the War Zone Security Team, dispatched troops to suppress the bandits in different directions. After encountering the bandits, some of them fled to Qiujiatun and outside the Jieshankou area, resisting the pursuing security team and local militia with the terrain. At dawn today (the 29th), the security team was ordered to search for the bandits, but they had all fled without a trace. Captain Wu Zhanyuan and Yutian County Magistrate Chen Baosheng reported this to Yin Rugeng and Wei Yonghe via telegram today (the 29th) and are making efforts to investigate the losses in the affected villages, as well as dispatching teams to continue searching for remaining bandits.</p>
<p>Since the signing of the Tanggu Truce, Japanese planes had not been scattering leaflets for a long time, but from the 27th of this month, Japanese planes have been flying from Rehe via Gubeikou to Miyun, Jixian, Sanhe, Zunhua, and other places from time to time, dropping leaflets. The leaflets dropped in Gubeikou were printed in red and green newspaper ink, with very simple sentences expressing that the responsibility for the Yutian Miyakoshi case should be pursued. (29th)</p>

<p>(Jinan Dispatch) Admiral Suetsugu Nobumasa, commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet, leading the entire fleet of warships and 45,000 officers and soldiers, arrived in Qingdao on the afternoon of the 28th. At 10 p.m. that night, he, along with Vice Admiral Takahashi and eight other attendants, as well as the military attache Hanatani who welcomed him in Qingdao, boarded the Jiaoji Railway train to the west. This morning (the 29th) at 7:15 a.m., they arrived in Jinan. The Japanese consul in Jinan, Nishida, and hundreds of Japanese residents, each holding a national flag, welcomed them at the station and took a group photo. Suetsugu also inspected the construction project of the building under construction at the Jiaoji Railway Station, and then took a car directly to the Japanese Consulate to rest. At 9:30 a.m., he, along with Nishida and Hanatani, paid a visit to Han Fuju, chairman of the provincial government. Han hosted a banquet. After leaving, at noon, he attended a public banquet hosted by the Japanese residents in Jinan. Suetsugu is scheduled to take the Jiaoji Railway train back to Qingdao at 10 p.m. tonight. A reporter interviewed Suetsugu at the Japanese Consulate today. Suetsugu made the following brief remarks: "Our fleet has been to Dalian ('Manchukuo'), Lushun, Yantai, and other places. Yesterday we arrived in Qingdao. There is no special mission for this trip to Jinan. Because there are many Japanese residents in Jiaodong, I came to take a look. I have not been to China for long, so I have no special feelings. However, I heard that things in Shandong are going very well. In short, it is very important that China and Japan should be on good terms, not just on the surface, but truly good, and that the two countries should unite to protect the peace and security of the East. At 9:30 a.m. today, I visited Chairman Han and plan to return to Qingdao at 10 p.m. tonight. I plan to stay in Qingdao for two or three days to exchange greetings with local officials and visit various places. After finishing in Qingdao, I will not go anywhere else and will return home directly," and so on. (29th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Northern Sichuan Refugees Awaiting Relief <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Telephones Central Government Requesting Funds</p>
<p>(Chongqing Dispatch) Recently, refugees from Tongnan and Banan have been moving and fleeing, visible along the banks of the Jialing River. Supporting the old and carrying the young, they lack even thin porridge. The situation is extremely dire. Although the headquarters has telegraphed various counties in northern Sichuan to set up shelters and expedite emergency relief, the number of refugees is too large and the relief is insufficient. The disaster victims are crying out for food, barely surviving, and the situation is extremely urgent. Liu Xiang telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, imploring the Ministry of Finance to quickly allocate large sums of money to address the immediate crisis. At the same time, Tian Songyao also sent a telegram to the headquarters, asking Liu to forward it to the Central Government. Both are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) (Respectfully addressed to Lin, Chairman of the National Government of Nanjing; Wang, President of the Executive Yuan; and Jiang, Chairman of the Nanchang Military Affairs Commission: I have carefully investigated that the Red bandits have caused devastation in Sichuan. In the past, I received 300,000 yuan for disaster relief, which was allocated to various disaster areas. The care and kindness are deeply appreciated. Recently, reports from various sources have stated that the refugees are displaced and in a dire state. I implore you to find ways to provide relief. My efforts have been insufficient, and I am deeply ashamed. I have exhausted my resources and cannot provide further support. I have ordered my subordinates to provide shelter, but our strength is limited. I know that you are deeply concerned about the suffering and take responsibility for the hungry and drowning. Think of the refugees exposed to the elements, awaiting relief, their hopes as high as the clouds, their survival uncertain from morning to evening. Moreover, with the Red bandits rampant, the rear is critical. Driven by hunger and cold, I fear that the able-bodied will become bandits, which is pitiful. Lamenting the old and weak dying in ditches, without immediate and extensive assistance, it will be impossible to avert this catastrophe. I implore you to order the Ministry of Finance to quickly allocate large sums of money to Sichuan for disaster relief, so as to prevent displacement. Then the people of Sichuan will be grateful for your kindness and benevolence. In addition to sending separate telegrams, I respectfully submit this telegram, awaiting your orders with utmost apprehension. Respectfully, Liu Xiang.)</p>
<p>(2) (Respectfully addressed to Lin, Chairman of the National Government; and Wang, President of the Executive Yuan: I have received the telegram from Tian Songyao (code seventeen), commander of the 29th Army, stating that refugees from Tongnan and Ba counties fleeing from the bandits have crossed the Jialing River, increasing tenfold compared to before. They are displaced and in an extremely miserable state. In addition to ordering the counties in the military districts to provide shelter and relief, the number of refugees is too large, making comprehensive assistance extremely difficult. I request that you find ways to raise funds for relief and forward this to the Central Government to allocate large sums of money for assistance. I have investigated that with the shift in the front lines of bandit suppression in northern Sichuan, the number of refugees has increased, and they are suffering greatly. Providing relief requires large sums of money. The drought and flood disasters in various counties of this province are extremely severe, making it difficult to raise funds locally. I implore you to consider the plight of the refugees and quickly order the Ministry of Finance to allocate large sums of money for relief to benefit the disaster victims. I am urgently awaiting your orders. Respectfully, Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of Sichuan Bandit Suppression, with Guo Changming, Chief of Staff, acting on his behalf.)</p>

<p>Rapid Progress of National Army Along Xingguo-Shicheng-Changting Line</p>
<p>Commander of Pseudo-Third Army Corps Zhang Yi Surrenders</p>
<p>(Nanchang Dispatch) Since the bandits were repeatedly surrounded and suppressed by the National Army, their elite forces have been almost entirely lost. The newly recruited bandit soldiers are purely a motley crowd, unable to withstand a single blow from the National Army. Currently, the bandits' combat troops, nominally numbering more than ten divisions, are distributed in three directions: Xingguo, Shicheng, and Changting, attempting to defend the bandit areas in order to prolong their existence. On the 22nd, the National Army's Zhou Column had already captured the line of Lantianxu and Xintian. In this battle, the Pseudo-First Army Corps' Second Division and the Pseudo-Fifth Army Corps' Thirteenth and Thirty-Fourth Divisions suffered more than 2,000 casualties and fled in disarray towards the vicinity of Gaoxingxu. The National Army is still tracking and suppressing them, and Xingguo is only thirty li away, and it will not be difficult to take it in one go. In the Shicheng area, the National Army's Third Route Army also captured Zhongzizhai, Zhonghuashan, Chenguling, Fenshuijun, and other places on the 26th and 27th. The bandits resisting the National Army were the Pseudo-Third Army Corps' Fourth and Fifth Divisions, and the Pseudo-First Army Corps' Fifteenth Division. The battle was fierce, and the bandits' casualties were estimated to be over 3,000. The commander of the Pseudo-Third Army Corps' Fourth Division, Zhang Yi, also became enlightened and led his troops to surrender. He stated that the strength of the bandit army has suffered several losses, and even if they wanted to replenish it, it would be impossible, because the able-bodied men in the bandit areas have already been exhausted. The bandit soldiers are all in a state of panic, and the people are also complaining. Moreover, there is discrimination and mutual sabotage within the bandits, and the time of their disintegration is not far away. Shicheng is now under the control of the National Army's artillery and air power, and recovery is imminent. Currently, in the Changting area, there are only the Pseudo-Ninth Army Corps' Third Division and the Pseudo-Twenty-Fourth Division, with fewer than 3,000 bandits. The National Army's Eastern Route is advancing towards Changting from Pengkou and captured the bandits' most fortified position, Baiyi Yangling, on the 27th of this month. The bandits suffered more than 1,000 casualties, and the attack is continuing. It will only take a few days to reach Changting.</p>
<h3 id="e85">A Northwest Inspection Report: Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Overview of Xining and the Scenery of Qinghai</p>
<p>Xining is located on the shaded side of the Xiaojishi Mountain and is the leading district of Qinghai. The climate is relatively cold, with summer temperatures only reaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit and winter temperatures dropping below zero. The Huangshui River traverses the area, and its downstream can be used for rafting. The land is fertile, and the production is particularly abundant. According to a survey, the county has 21,754.93 mu of arable land, 241,515.37 mu of barren land, totaling 263,170.3 mu. In 1929, Gansu experienced a severe drought, and Lanzhou's food supply depended entirely on shipments from here. In recent years, grain prices have also been lower than elsewhere. It is a pity that grain merchants only transport goods with livestock, which is inconvenient. The county has a population of approximately 170,000, with Han Chinese accounting for 64%, Hui Muslims for 20%, and the Tu and Tibetan groups each accounting for 8%. In the past, Hui-Han relations were prone to rifts, but recently, due to the authorities in government and the military not discriminating and working together, the people are gradually becoming more harmonious. The Tu and Tibetan groups have limited knowledge and have long been assimilated by the Han Chinese.</p>
<p>The city borders the southern bank of the Huangshui River, surrounded by mountains and ridges, with a magnificent landscape. It is the first of the four major trading areas for Han and Tibetan peoples and the eastern gateway to Qinghai. In 1928, Qinghai was established as a province, and it was designated as the provincial capital. Government agencies were set up, and the number of schools increased. Currently, there are seven secondary schools: the Mongolian-Tibetan Normal School, the Provincial First High School, the First Normal School, the Girls' Normal School, the Agricultural School, the Vocational School, and the Hui Islamic Advancement Association Middle School (the Hui Islamic Advancement Association High School and the Xining Branch of the Central Political School, which includes Mongolian and Tibetan studies, are also about to open). These schools have approximately 2,100 students. There are many elementary schools, with more than 3,000 students. Other counties only have a junior high school in Ledu, and the rest are only elementary schools. Funding is difficult, making it difficult to promote education. The students' lives are also very difficult, but their bodies are quite healthy. The Hui Islamic Advancement Association Middle School and the elementary schools run by the county branches have sufficient funding and are thriving.</p>
<p>Wang Qian, the chief of the military law department, and Zhu Guangtian, the director, of the 100th Division Headquarters, successively hosted dinners and introduced friends familiar with the situation in Qinghai, which was very beneficial. According to Qiu Xianglu, the secretary-general of the Provincial Party Headquarters, there are more than 490 party members in Qinghai Province, with formal and probationary members accounting for half each. The county party headquarters have canceled the former workers' and peasants' associations and other groups because they could not seek the interests of the people and became fundraising organizations that exploited the people. They are focusing on promoting social education, such as establishing libraries and creating literacy schools. The province currently has publications, the most prominent of which is the Republican Daily, founded on July 1, 1929. At that time, the National Revolutionary Army occupied the Northwest, and news from other provinces was isolated. The printing was poor, and the content was simple. In 1931, the Special Commissioner's Office of the Provincial Party Affairs Department was established, and a radio room was set up. News broadcast by the Central Broadcasting Station every day was transcribed and published, and the content gradually became more substantial. In June 1933, a hand-cranked printing machine donated by the Central Government was received, and copper printing was adopted. However, due to the narrow administrative scope of the province, it was difficult to collect news, and funding was difficult, so only one sheet of quarto paper was published each day. Plans for expansion are currently underway. In addition, there is the Qinghai Review bi-monthly, which is sponsored by the Provincial Party Special Office; the 100th Weekly, which is sponsored by the Special Party Headquarters of the 100th Division; the To the People Weekly, which is sponsored by Song Shouyi, the rural instructor of the Provincial Party Special Office. Huzhu, Datong, and Huangyuan counties each publish a weekly newspaper by their respective county party headquarters. Each newspaper is printed in 200-300 copies and is mostly distributed as gifts. In addition, Ma Yusan, the president of the local court, is also planning to establish a National Daily.</p>
<p>Li Xiaozhong, the secretary-general of the Special Party Headquarters of the 100th Division, said that the division has participated in many battles, roughly as follows: In March 1928, Ma Zhongying incited a rebellion in Dahe, and the National Revolutionary Army's suppression was ineffective. Division Commander Ma Bufang, who was then the commander of the 77th Brigade, participated in the war in March 1929, cleared the remaining bandits, and pacified Dahe. In July 1930, Ma Tingxian incited a rebellion in Longnan. At that time, Division Commander Ma was the commander of the Provisional First Division of Qinghai. Wang Zhen, the acting chairman of Gansu, telegraphed requesting the dispatch of troops for joint suppression and recovered Dingxi County. In the autumn of 1930, Ma Zhongying led his remnant troops to occupy the area of Ganliang, arbitrarily persecuting the people. Division Commander Ma was then the commander of the newly formed Ninth Division and moved to Zhangye and Jiuquan counties according to the telegram from Chairman Gu Zhutong of Tongguan. Ma Zhongying retreated into Xinjiang, and Hexi was pacified. In July 1931, Lei Zhongtian, commander of the newly formed Eighth Division of Gansu, violated the Central Government and detained Chairman Ma Hongbin. Division Commander Ma advised him to be prudent and resolve the issue. In April 1932, Tibetan soldiers, instigated by British imperialists, invaded Hainan, occupied Dasuomang, Nangqian, and other places, and besieged Jiegu. The Qinghai provincial government was reluctant to engage in fratricidal conflict and first sent envoy Ma Xun to persuade the troops to withdraw, but it was ineffective. Later, troops were dispatched to support and recover the lost territory, and both sides sent personnel to negotiate peace. In the summer of 1933, the Central Government appointed Sun Dianying as the Qinghai Reclamation Commissioner. Subsequently, the Central Government, considering the opinions of the people of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, telegraphed Sun to postpone his westward advance. Sun took advantage of the outbreak of the Fujian Incident and occupied Dengkou in January of this year and besieged Ningxia. Division Commander Ma received a telegram from Director Zhu Shaoliang ordering him to send troops to Ningxia and cooperate with the 35th Division of the 15th Route Army to fight against the old rebels. The enemy completely retreated on the night of March 18, and the Ningxia area was preserved. Although this is the history of struggle of only one division in a few short years, it also reflects one page of the recent frequent changes experienced by the people of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, who are like brothers in distress.</p>
<p>Upstream of the Huanghe River is a large lake called Qinghai, from which the province gets its name. It is 270 li from Xining to the sea, which can be reached in three days on horseback. In summer and autumn, it appears as a vast expanse of blue, as if floating in the sky and about to pour down. The terrain is very high, about 7,100 feet above sea level. The perimeter of the sea is not yet accurately known. Some say it is 600 li, others say it is 800 li. The Tibetans say that it takes 18 days to ride a horse around the sea, which would be at least 1,000 li. The water is extremely clear, contains salt, and tastes salty and delicious. It is rumored to be a weak water that cannot float mustard seeds, but this is not true. However, the wind and waves are extremely large and continuous throughout the year. Aquatic birds and grass leaves are washed to the edge by the waves. Not only is it extremely difficult to sail ships, but the surrounding wilderness within a hundred li cannot be cultivated due to the strong winds. The sea is rich in fish, without scales, with black spots on the back, called Huang fish. In summer, the Tibetans strike them with sticks, and in winter, they catch them by drilling holes. The abdomen is cut open, the intestines are removed, and they are dried on the spot. The ground contains salt, which prevents them from rotting. However, the Tibetans have other concerns (the reasons are detailed elsewhere) and do not eat fish, so they are mostly transported to other counties for sale, amounting to hundreds of thousands of jin per year. There are two mountains in the sea, one resembling a snail shell and the other resembling a camel hump, located in the east and west, called Haixin Mountain. Temples are built on them, with dozens of lamas. In winter, when the sea is frozen, they drive cattle and horses, transporting fur to various counties in Huangyuan in exchange for food to prepare for the whole year. Southwest of the sea is a salt pond, which is very rich in production, of good quality and delicious taste, forming square crystals. Fifty li east of the sea is the Sea God Temple. Every autumn, the Qinghai authorities send letters to summon Mongolian princes to hold a grand alliance ceremony here. The ceremony is simple but contains significant political significance.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1907 (Gregorian calendar), the Russian Kozlov crossed Qinghai in a cloth boat to Haixin Mountain. When the Mongolians and Tibetans saw him, they were amazed and thought he was a celestial being. Kozlov discovered that Haixin Mountain is located in the middle of the lake and its geology is composed of granite and mica schist. The deepest part of the lake is about 120 feet, and the surface water temperature is 58 degrees Fahrenheit. The shoreline of the lake within three to five li is sandy, and beyond that is alluvial mud.</p>

<p>Reinstatement of Quota at the Prosecutor's Office</p>
<p>This county's court, after Hu Yi-gu was assigned by the High Court to inspect Songjiang this year in January, deemed that the number of cases was low, which necessitated downsizing. A request to dismiss one prosecutor and one judge was filed. The request was then approved by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the prosecutor was dismissed. The duties were handled by the chief prosecutor. Prosecutor Mengzhou was reassigned elsewhere. However, the scarcity of lawsuits in January was not a reliable indicator. Recently, the number of lawsuits has increased daily, making it difficult for one person to handle them all. The court president Wang Sixian was consulted and a joint request was made to the Ministry of Judicial Administration regarding the increased number of lawsuits and reinstatement of the quota. A directive approving the request has arrived in Songjiang, and it is learned that one prosecutor will be added and will arrive in Songjiang next month.</p>

<p>Farmer Killed for Repaying Debt</p>
<p>Lu A-mei, a farmer from Xiaole Township in the Eighth District, borrowed 80 yuan from Zhu Lao-han of Tangjiaozui, Waishipile, last year. Because Zhu urgently demanded repayment, Lu sold the harvested cotton and managed to raise 75 yuan. On the day before yesterday, Lu went to Zhu's place to repay the debt. However, Zhu was not at home, so Lu took the money back. While passing through Tangjiaozui, Lu met a friend, Huang Nan, who invited Lu to Shen Zhiqing's house to smoke opium. Afterwards, they each returned home. However, the next day, a male corpse was discovered in the reeds of Ciren Township. It appeared to be a murder. Some recognized the corpse as Lu A-mei and informed Lu's family, who reported it to the Eighth District Office, which in turn reported it to the county government. Yesterday, officials were dispatched to conduct an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that the corpse had more than ten stab wounds on the head, eyes, chest, and abdomen. The suspects, Shen Zhiqing, Huang Nan, and Shen Gong, who were apprehended, are being interrogated rigorously.</p>

<p>Zheng Ge on Hunger Strike in Jail</p>
<p>Zheng Ge, a former prison guard in this county, falsely used the name of the Nantong District Commissioner's Office to swindle and deceive others. After Commissioner Zheng learned of this, he ordered the county to arrest Zheng, who is temporarily detained in the county public security bureau's detention center. Zheng is said to be suffering from severe psychological distress, is experiencing erratic behavior, is crying and laughing uncontrollably, and is not eating. Zheng has been on a hunger strike for six days, and his condition is deteriorating daily, raising concerns about his life. Yesterday (the 27th), the county public security bureau submitted a report to the county government requesting instructions. County Magistrate Zhang instructed the bureau to send Zheng to the Tongshan Hospital for diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>Huang Mingsheng, the chief of the third sub-bureau of the public security bureau in Sanyang Town, the fourth district, and patrol leader Chen Gongyu, among others, were accused by Gong Fang and others of collecting donations from gambling and opium dens. County Magistrate Zhang ordered the county public security bureau to arrest Huang Mingsheng and patrol leaders Chen Gongyu, Lu Kaishan, and patrolman Lin Xuehai and send them to the county. After interrogation by Chen, Huang Mingsheng was released on bail, while Chen, Lu, and Lin were detained. County Magistrate Zhang believes that the sub-bureau chief's collection of irregular fees has been confirmed by the confessions of Chen, Lu, and Lin, and yesterday ordered the county public security bureau to dismiss Huang Mingsheng and place him under supervision to facilitate interrogation. The vacancy will be filled by Zhou Mingyi, who will be appointed as acting chief by the county public security bureau.</p>

<p>Unresolved Dispute Over Tobacco and Alcohol Tax</p>
<p>This county's tobacco and alcohol license tax collection office ordered a doubling of the tobacco and alcohol license tax rates for the current session of businesses, including liquor and sauce, sauce shops, tobacco exchange, cigarette, and native tobacco businesses, which has caused a backlash. The situation was previously reported in this newspaper. It is learned that the five trade associations have received reports from members that recently, a large number of tax office employees have been dispatched to various tobacco and liquor stores in the city and countryside, forcibly demanding double tax payments, and even taking away cigarettes and other goods from the stores without authorization, causing considerable disturbance. Upon receiving the reports, the associations convened a joint meeting again yesterday, resolving to firmly resist the tax increase. They also sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce requesting assistance to stop the tax office from harassing the market.</p>

<p>Wu Yingshan, a villager from Zoujia Alley in Zhouxin Town, Third District, has been engaged in the pig trade. Recently, Wu shipped dozens of large pigs from the Jiangbei area, intending to transport them to Hangzhou and other places in Zhejiang Province for sale. Unexpectedly, when sailing in Taihu Lake the night before last, they suddenly encountered a pirate ship. Five bandits jumped onto the pig boat and searched and robbed it for about half an hour before fleeing with their stolen goods. The incident has not yet been reported to the authorities for investigation. In addition, Liu Fengsheng from Funing came to Wuxi the day before yesterday to look for his son. Around midnight, Liu took a pedicab from Chong'an Temple to the railway station. The pedicab driver, Zeng Huirong, seeing Liu's wealth, harbored evil intentions and colluded with another pedicab driver named Chong Youfu, instructing him to wait in the deserted Houqi Street Dawang Temple. He then took a detour with Liu to that location, intending to rob him. Liu shouted for help, and Wang Dexue, a police officer from the nearby Fifth Precinct Police Station, heard the cries and went to assist Liu Fengsheng in apprehending the two pedicab drivers. They were taken to the station for interrogation.</p>

<p>General Situation of the Drought in Wujin This Year: The drought in Wujin this year is unprecedented in sixty years. The extent of the disaster area is also the largest seen in sixty years. In total, the disaster-stricken area in Wujin covers 813,494 mu (a Chinese unit of area, approximately 0.165 acres). Even when calculating only the severely affected areas (60% or more crop failure), there are still 673,372 mu. The disaster area spans all townships, with the most severely affected being the old Qin, Mingfeng, Jingxiao, Shangyi, Dayou, Tongjiang, Huainan, Huaibei, Anshang, Huihua, Taiping, and Dingdong townships. The preliminary survey has been completed. A table listing the affected townships and their areas is presented below:</p>

<p>The home of Duan Baoren, a resident of Panjiaqiao Town, Eighth District of Wuyi County, was robbed on the night of the 21st of this month. Duan's wife was also shot by the robbers. Subsequently, the Zoumatang Security Corps apprehended two key suspects in the case, Yang Jinchuan and Tang Shenggeng, on the 25th, and recovered a stolen private seal belonging to Duan Baoren. They were taken to the district office. After a preliminary interrogation by District Chief Wang Qingtong, he ordered them to be shackled and guarded by security corps members, intending to hand them over to the county for interrogation the next day. However, the robbers escaped in the middle of the night, breaking their shackles and opening the door lock. The county government, based on reports from Wu Cai and others, the heads of the Zoumatang Security Corps, accusing District Chief Wang of accepting bribes and releasing the suspects, summoned the security corps members who had been guarding the robbers on the 29th. After questioning them, the county government ordered District Chief Wang Qingtong and the two security corps members to be placed under watch. The county government ordered the assistant, Sun Shizheng, to temporarily take charge of district affairs.</p>

<p>Telegram Requesting Postponement of Land Tax Collection</p>
<p>The county government has announced that the first installment of this year's land tax, accounting for 40%, will be collected starting on October 1st, with collection points set up in various rural areas. Now, citizens Chen Xingjie and others have telegraphed the provincial government, requesting a temporary postponement of the tax collection. This is due to the severe drought this summer, which is unprecedented in eighty years, causing immense hardship for the people. A request to postpone the first installment of this year's land tax is under review. However, County Magistrate Bao Gang, despite being mindful of the people's difficulties, has decided to collect the tax starting on the first of next month. We, the common people, have long been in dire straits. We are barely able to pay the regular tax, let alone the various surcharges that have not been reduced at all. Therefore, we earnestly request Your Excellency to instruct the county government via telegram to temporarily suspend the tax collection.</p>
<p>Special Item</p>
<h3 id="e96">A Record of Investigation into the Jingdezhen Porcelain Industry (Part 2) by Du Chongyuan <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>There are more than a hundred porcelain kilns in Jingdezhen, all owned by a few wealthy households in Duchang. The kiln system involves calculating firewood costs based on the number of porcelain pieces. (Jingdezhen uses wood-fired kilns.) The firewood costs must be paid in advance. The kiln owners are not responsible for the quality of the firing. Moreover, the kiln owners do not need to be stationed in the town permanently; they only assign a few kiln workers to manage the affairs. The kiln workers not only do not earn salaries from the kiln owners but also have to pay them a considerable "activity fee." As for how the kiln workers make up for their losses, when the blank (unfired porcelain) producers fire their pieces, they have to pay the kiln workers a commission (commonly known as "rou jin," literally "meat money," which is simply a bribe). If the blank producers do not pay the "rou jin," the kiln workers can arbitrarily damage the blanks or place them in areas with low or high firing temperatures, making them susceptible to kiln collapses. Therefore, the blank producers have no choice but to pay the commission. Recently, due to the sluggish business environment, kiln owners, in order to seek greater profits, arbitrarily enlarged the kiln bodies to accommodate more porcelain pieces and collect more firewood money. However, with larger kiln bodies, the firing temperature is bound to be higher. When the firing temperature is high, the saggars (protective ceramic boxes) cannot withstand it, and kiln collapses are becoming more frequent. The kiln owners do not care. Even worse, the kiln owners implement kiln restrictions to increase firewood money. What are kiln restrictions? They mean that the kiln owners collude to limit the firing frequency. Kilns that can be fired eight times a month are restricted to only two or three times. In this way, the blank producers cannot wait and have to let the kiln owners dictate the price, even if it is high. As a result, the blank producers suffer more losses, and their costs increase. Higher costs lead to slow sales, and fewer people engage in blank production. With fewer people making blanks, the kiln owners and saggar factories exert even more pressure. The outcome is mutual destruction. However, this is only the internal injury. As for the external factors, such as inconvenient transportation, frequent conflicts with bandits, and the global economic depression that has swept into Jingdezhen, the future seems even bleaker. In recent years, the number of kiln owners (blank producers) has decreased from 4,000 to 1,000, and the number of workers has decreased from 100,000 to 40,000. The total business volume has shrunk from 1.45 million yuan to 2-3 million yuan. Every year-end, honest kiln owners and workers often hang themselves, while cunning ones become bandits. The roads are filthy, and the people look malnourished. In the entire town, it is impossible to find a child with rosy cheeks. The three managers from the Bank of China who accompanied me were all round-faced, stout, and portly. Mr. Zhou Xiaofang weighed 242 pounds, Mr. Cai Shenzhai weighed 219 pounds, and Mr. Zhou Daren weighed 217 pounds. When they walked through the streets, the townspeople flocked to watch, as if they were seeing strange creatures. This shows that the town had never seen such blessed people with round faces and big bellies. The town is known for its "five excesses": opium, prostitutes, bedbugs, latrines, and dead rats. Therefore, plague epidemics have occurred over the years. Recently, since the special operations unit of the Nanchang Headquarters arrived in the town and implemented intervention and ordered cleanliness, the situation is better than before. The above rambling description gives a general picture of Jingdezhen.</p>
<p>As for rescuing Jingdezhen, it is not without solutions; it only depends on whether the government has the determination. People who have visited Jingdezhen over the years always say how each industry is controlled and how stubborn the workers are, as if the source of Jingdezhen's industry's illness lies entirely there. In reality, this is just a symptom of Jingdezhen, not the cause. What is the cause? It is the government's laissez-faire attitude. In past dynasties, Jingdezhen had kiln officials who specialized in managing these matters. They thoroughly understood the workers' hardships and labor-management disputes and could guide them accordingly. Since the Republic of China, a purely laissez-faire policy has been adopted, with local officials acting as managers. (During the Hongxian era, a pottery industry supervisor was established once for the reconstruction of the imperial kiln.) However, local officials are not familiar with the pottery industry and deal with matters perfunctorily. Dishonest individuals see it as a source of wealth. Therefore, the Jingdezhen County Magistrate and the Chief of the Public Security Bureau are known as lucrative positions. Imagine putting hundreds of thousands of ignorant people in positions with conflicting interests; disputes are inevitable. Whenever disputes arise, the government cannot resolve them, or even if they do, it is not fair. The workers can only follow ancient methods or resort to force to resolve them themselves. Adhering to ancient methods is close to stubbornness, and using force only leads to more disputes. As a result, the strong bully the weak, the majority abuse the minority, they are reckless and destructive, and the situation has become so broken and fragmented. The solution is for the government to establish a pottery administration and management agency, elevate its position, expand its authority, and choose someone who is knowledgeable about the pottery industry and passionate about workers' welfare to hold the position for a long time. They should handle matters directly without delay. The workers are inherently afraid of the government, so as long as the measures are appropriate, they will all be happy. The pottery administration and management agency should establish a raw material refining factory. All raw materials should be purchased by the government at low prices and refined mechanically, then sold to blank producers at low prices. At the same time, a model porcelain factory should be established to demonstrate porcelain manufacturing methods, the benefits of cooperation, and the conversion to coal-fired kilns to reduce costs and eliminate the evils of kiln restrictions. Then, a model cooperative should be established for cooperative purchasing and cooperative marketing. All symptoms of control can be swept away. As for fundamental solutions, it is especially necessary to improve transportation. In the past, Jingdezhen's transportation relied entirely on the Rao River, which connects to Poyang Lake. However, the upper reaches of the Rao River are shallow and have many shoals. In the autumn, the water is dry, and it often takes months to reach Hukou, which is time-consuming and causes a lot of damage, greatly affecting sales. Recently, it was reported that the Jinghu Highway (from Jingdezhen to Hukou) has been repaired. It would be better to convert the highway into a railway, laying only light rails and purchasing a small locomotive for freight transportation. Not only would it facilitate the transportation of porcelain, but it would also provide an outlet for tea from Wuyuan and Qimen. In this way, both internal and external problems can be addressed, and all ills can be eliminated. Not only will the original state be restored, but it will also be promoted and expanded. Recent progress has been made in Jingdezhen's artistic products, but unfortunately, there is no one to connect them for cooperation, encouragement, and learning from each other, resulting in unscrupulous merchants making one bottle in the east and painting one color in the west, earning hundreds of times the profit through repeated labor. Therefore, although many porcelain makers in Jingdezhen have been losing money in recent years, porcelain vendors everywhere have been making fortunes. (These porcelain vendors refer specifically to those dealing in artistic goods, not ordinary porcelain merchants.) This is all due to the ignorance of the workers, who do not know how to cooperate. All of these things should be changed and reorganized by the pottery administration and management agency through organization and training. When Jingdezhen's porcelain industry has improved slightly and the workers' lives have gradually stabilized, then further research on worker education and public health should be conducted. Only then will Jingdezhen have a promising future.</p>
<p>The estimated costs for rescuing the Jingdezhen porcelain industry are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw material refining factory: 100,000 yuan</p>
<p>Model porcelain factory: 200,000 yuan</p>
<p>Various cooperatives: 150,000 yuan</p>
<p>Education subsidies and research expenses: 50,000 yuan</p>
<p>Annual operating expenses for the pottery administration and management agency: 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Light rail and locomotives (280 li [approximately 93 miles]): Separate budget to be determined by experts (End)</p>

<p>No Definite Date Yet for Liu's Reinstatement</p>
<p>Guizhou King Sends Telegram Reporting Bandit Situation</p>
<p>National News Agency reports: Deng Mingjie, the Sichuan Province representative in Shanghai, went to Sichuan at the beginning of the month with Chuan Zhenwu, the representative in Nanjing. He then flew from Chongqing to Guling to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, reporting on the military situation of suppressing bandits in Sichuan Province and the local situation. He then went to Nanjing to meet with Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei to discuss matters. Deng left Nanjing the night before last and returned to Shanghai by night train, arriving yesterday morning. When the National News Agency reporter visited him, they discussed the Sichuan situation. Deng said that there had been a minor setback in the military suppression of bandits in Sichuan at the beginning of the month. However, after Liu Xiang personally went to the front to direct the operations, morale was boosted. Since the 25th of this month, the military situation has been improving daily. Although Liu has not been reinstated, the central government relies on him heavily, and Liu himself knows that he cannot shirk his responsibility under the current circumstances. However, there are still many important issues being resolved. Once these issues are resolved satisfactorily, Liu can be reinstated soon. Although the exact date of reinstatement has not been set, it will not be far off. When he met with Chairman Chiang in Guling, Chiang showed great concern for Sichuan. This was also the case when he met with President Wang in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Wang Jialie, the Chairman of Guizhou Province, telegraphed Deng on the 26th, informing him that the military suppression of bandits in the province was progressing smoothly. The telegram arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The original telegram is recorded below: (To Mr. Deng Mingjie in Shanghai: According to a telephone report from my Zhenyuan Chief of Staff Huang Liehou at 4:00 PM, Xiao Bandit was attacked by Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou troops at Da Xiao Guang at 9:00 AM on the morning of [the 25th] and fled towards the Bagua River. At 9:00 AM this morning, they were again attacked by the three provinces' troops at the Bagua River. Xiao Bandit then broke through and fled west to Douwu in Jianhe County, where they resisted stubbornly. The three provinces' troops are tracking and attacking. The fighting has been fierce since morning and is still ongoing. Because the bandits lack food, they sent several hundred bandits to the Sanhui Wazhai area to requisition supplies. They were intercepted and annihilated by my [illegible] Regiment Commander's joint forces and fled back to Douwu. [illegible], that bandit has suffered heavy losses from the encirclement and suppression in Guizhou Province, so they have repeatedly tried to cross the Zhenyuan River but have failed. Now that they are being attacked from all sides, I believe they can be thoroughly resolved. In addition to ordering the units at the front to cooperate with friendly forces to work hard to encircle and suppress them, this telegram is sent to you. Also, according to a telegram from Commander Li Chengzhang, our troops tracked and pursued He Bandit and captured Kuzhuba on the Sichuan border. It has already been telegraphed to you. Today, we have recovered Xiaojingkou and are currently contacting Sichuan troops to encircle and suppress them. This is telegraphed to you. Wang Jialie kowtows, You Can from Chong'an sends the seal.)</p>

<p>Due to Lawsuit Filed by Families of Those Who Drowned After the Ship Ran Aground</p>
<p>Shipping Trade Association Cables Requesting Release</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports: The Shanghai-to-Sha Line Baohua steamer of the Ping An Commercial Shipping Company sailed from Shanghai to Sha on the 27th of this month. On the 28th, after arriving at Antou Port, it was detained by the Qidong County government. The captain was arrested. The reason is that the families of the passengers who drowned on the 12th of this month after the ship ran aground at Sanhe Port filed a lawsuit. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e104">Crew Members Detained <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Ren Rugui, a worker, and Liu Zhichang, a tea server, who drowned after the Baohua steamer ran aground at Sanhe Port on the 12th of this month, have been recovered and buried. The company has provided compensation. The steamer sailed from Shanghai to Sha at 5:00 PM on the 27th of this month. On the 28th, after arriving at Antou Port at 10:00 AM, the Qidong County government sent armed police to detain the steamer and assigned police to guard the ship. At the same time, the shipowner and crew members were arrested and taken to the county government. The reason is that the families of the drowned passengers filed a lawsuit with the county government.</p>

<p>The captain of the Baohua steamer immediately telegraphed the Ping An General Company in Shanghai to report the detention. The company immediately telegraphed its office at Antou Port to inquire about the details of the detention. It then received a reply telegram stating, "It is known that the detention of the Baohua steamer is due to a lawsuit. The captain has been interrogated and detained. Send a person in charge to come quickly and ask someone influential to handle the matter." The company immediately reported to the Shanghai Shipping Trade Association, requesting that it telegraph the county to release the ship in order to facilitate transportation. At the same time, it also reported to the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Requesting Release by Telegram <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Shipping Trade Association telegraphed Qidong County:</p>
<p>To County Magistrate Li of the Qidong County Government: According to a report from member Ping An Company, we received a telegram from the Antou Port Bureau stating that the Baohua steamer has been detained and all staff members have been taken to the county government, etc. We do not know the reason and are deeply shocked. If it is due to the previous grounding of our ship at Sanhe Port, then our ship has properly handled the aftermath of the accident for the crew and passengers, and whether the crew members were at fault has also been reported to the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau, the competent authority, for thorough investigation and assessment. The company's ships are all registered and licensed, so even if someone files a lawsuit, there is no risk of escape. Ships are related to transportation, and the company is responsible for responding to the lawsuit, so there is no need to detain the ship. Please have the public association telegram the county government to release our ship and allow the crew members to be released on bail. If there is a lawsuit, our company will be responsible for responding to it, so as to avoid losses and maintain transportation. This is a matter of public interest, and we hope for a reply by telegram. Yu Kouyan, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Shipping Association.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Impact on Transportation <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The ships operating on the Shanghai-to-Sha line, on odd days, are the Ping An Company's Baohua steamer, the Yuxing Company's Xinrenhe steamer, and the Daxing Company's Fuxing steamer. On even days, they are the Zaida Company's Guangxiang steamer and the Jufeng Company's Baofeng steamer, for a total of five ships. Since the Baohua steamer, which operates on odd days, was detained, and the Xinrenhe steamer is currently undergoing repairs, only the Fuxing steamer is operating. The Fuxing steamer has a net tonnage of 372 tons and limited passenger capacity. The number of passengers traveling from Shanghai to Sha or from Sha to Shanghai every day is quite large, so the Fuxing steamer cannot load them all, which has an impact on transportation.</p>

<p>After receiving a report from the Ping An Company, the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation telegraphed the Qidong County government, "According to a report from the Ping An Commercial Shipping Company, the Baohua steamer has been detained. What is the reason? Please reply by telegram." A New Voice News Agency reporter interviewed Li Yaoting, the manager of the Ping An Company, at the Atlantic Western Restaurant last night. According to him, in the case of the Baohua steamer running aground at Sanhe Port, the company has provided generous compensation to the families of the drowned worker and tea server, and there were no drowned passengers. It is deeply shocking that County Magistrate Li of Qidong County detained the ship. The Shipping Trade Association, etc., have telegraphed the county to release the ship, but as of this moment, no reply telegram has been received from the county.

<h3 id="e109">To Expand Direct Sino-British Telegraph Services <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yu Senwen Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday to Prepare for Departure</p>
<p>Ordered to Concurrently Investigate Vocational Education in Europe</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports: The Ministry of Transportation believes that Sino-British telecommunications are very important after the international radio station began direct Sino-British communications. Therefore, the transportation authorities attach great importance to this. Since the line was implemented in May of this year, there has been a need to actively plan for the development and expansion of telecommunications. Recently, Yu Senwen, the chairman of the Employee Affairs Committee of the Ministry, was specially sent to the UK to serve as the Ministry's resident commissioner in the UK's International Telecommunications Bureau, responsible for contacting and promoting this initiative. Yu arrived in Shanghai yesterday and visited Wen Yuqing, the director of the International Telecommunications Bureau, to discuss the measures to be taken to contact the British side. Yu has now decided to take the Italian postal ship Conte Verde to the UK in the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Expanding Sino-British Telecommunications <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>According to Yu yesterday, his mission to the UK is to discuss and plan with the British side on matters related to direct Sino-British radio communications. Because of the agreement made between the two sides at the beginning of the direct communication business between China and the UK in May of this year, it stated that there should be a balance of telegrams between the two countries in order to achieve the principle of equality in telegraph fee revenue. Since the opening of communications, according to statistics, the average number of telegrams sent from our country per day is about seventy or eighty, while the average number of telegrams from the UK is only about twenty, accounting for only one-quarter, which puts our side at a considerable disadvantage. The reason for the imbalance is that in addition to the direct line of Sino-British cooperation for wireless telecommunications between the UK and our country, the UK also has the Sannorth Wireless Telegraph Company, which can send telegrams to the Far East. The British people are accustomed to sending telegrams to the Sannorth Company, so the direct Sino-British line has been affected. Even the overseas Chinese in the UK are mostly not fully aware of the significance of direct Sino-British communications and have not fully utilized the line. Therefore, Yu's mission to the UK is to contact the British side and, at the same time, plan and promote publicity in the UK to develop Sino-British telecommunications.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Investigating Vocational Education <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>In addition to handling Sino-British telecommunications, Yu has also been specially assigned by the Ministry to investigate the implementation of vocational education in various advanced industrial countries in Europe, such as Germany, France, Italy, the UK, and Switzerland, after completing his work in the UK. He will also pay attention to labor management, employee administration, and other aspects to serve as a reference for our country's improvement. Yu, who was the chairman of the Employee Affairs Committee of the Ministry of Transportation, has made considerable achievements in the past in the education and management of transportation employees in our country. It is believed that his return from this overseas investigation will bring a new contribution. It is reported that Yu's trip is scheduled for one year.</p>
<p>Chunhua Steamer</p>

<p>After Inspection, It Is Decided to Invite Bids for Dockyard Repairs</p>
<p>The Cargo Onboard Has Rotted and Been Completely Abandoned</p>
<p>The Chunhua steamer, which is represented by the Yu Da Shipping Company, ran aground outside the port of Quanzhou in July. After the Shanghai Ship Insurance Association, which underwrote the Ping An Insurance, requested the dockyard to send workers to rescue it, it was rescued. The company hired a tugboat from the British company Weidefeng Tugboat Company to tow the Chunhua steamer from Pingyang to Shanghai.

<p>Ningbo Industrial Bank</p>
<h3 id="e115">New Bank Building Completed, Opening Today <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Industrial Bank is committed to supporting industry and developing fisheries, agriculture, industry, and commerce. Now, due to business expansion, the new bank building has been completed and is scheduled to open today. The history of the bank's establishment and the reasons for promoting its business are detailed below:</p>
<p>History of the Establishment of Ningbo Industrial Bank: Banking is a national economic organization that supports people's livelihoods and has a profound relationship with the country and society. Therefore, those who establish banks must embrace the spirit of serving society, focusing on supporting production and maintaining people's livelihoods to achieve the goal of cultivating national strength. Otherwise, the establishment of banks will lose its value. In the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the initiators of Ningbo Bank, in view of the increasing backwardness of China's production industries, believed that if this phenomenon was not urgently addressed, not only would the progress of the Three People's Principles be hindered, but also the national economy supporting the country's survival would face the danger of panic. Therefore, there was a proposal to organize the Ningbo Industrial Bank. The reason for naming it Ningbo Industrial Bank was not to promote a narrow regional perspective, but to gather enthusiastic people from Ningbo to support the entire industry, and to hope that people from other regions could also use local connections as a basis for unity, and work together for the development of industry, in order to seek the development of production. The bank was initiated by Yu Qiaqing, Wu Zhihao, Lin Kanghou, He Shaoting, He Shaoyu, Xiang Longdong, Xu Maotang, Zhang Boqin, Zhang Shenzhi, Wu Tingsheng, Yang Songren, Wu Zhihe, Yu Guozhen, Cao Guohua, Li Quancai, Dong Zhongxiu, Zhou Yongsheng, Chen Cuifu, and others in the summer of the 20th year of the Republic of China. A shareholders' founding meeting was convened on the National Day of the 20th year of the Republic of China. The Ministry of Finance successively issued registration approvals with the Qian Zi No. 14023, business licenses with the Yin Zi No. 108, and licenses with the Industry Department's She Zi No. 240. After several meetings of the board of directors, it was decided to eliminate various businesses similar to speculation, and to engage only in legal businesses that are beneficial to production, and to strive to implement the original intention. The third floor of the building at No. 500 Henan Road was rented as the bank's address. It started business on April 10th of the 21st year, and officially opened on June 4th of the same year. All service personnel of the bank take the bank's advocacy as the common direction of struggle, and the business has become increasingly developed. In March of the 23rd year, in order to facilitate services, the bank again decided by the board of directors to build a new bank building at the corner of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road. In September of the same year, the construction of the new bank building was completed, and it was decided to move into the new site for business on October 1st. The bank's business operations are based on the original advocacy. Later, in order to seek external development, a remittance agency was first established in Ningbo, and then a branch was established. Shenjiamen has always been a famous fishing area, but due to economic decline, fishermen are extremely distressed, and the fishing industry is also declining day by day. The bank, based on its consistent goal of supporting production, established a branch in Shenjiamen, specializing in fishing mortgages and loans, so that fishermen would not be unable to use their labor due to economic difficulties. After more than two years of operation, it has achieved excellent results, and the fishermen are especially delighted. Recently, the bank, wanting to do a little to serve the economic countryside, specially established a branch in Suzhou and a sub-branch in Kunshan, specializing in mortgages on agricultural products such as rice and wheat. At the same time, branches have also been established in the French Concession and the Nanshi districts of this city, so that those who love and support the bank will not have to travel back and forth. It is heard that the bank's small loans for ordinary people will prevent ordinary people with steady jobs from being exploited by high-interest loans. The mortgage of national products has an indirect and profound relationship with the development of industry and commerce, and is now also being actively carried out. In the future, a national product warehouse will be established in order to serve national products to the best of its ability, so that the development of society and the country can gain considerable benefits from this. This is the history of the bank's establishment and the current direction of its business.</p>
<p>The Origin of Promoting Ningbo Industrial Bank (Zhuang Songfu): According to ancient times, the market was held in the middle of the day, and goods were exchanged for goods, without the so-called buying and selling of money. Since the creation of coins, the transaction of goods has changed to the substitution of money, and then to the use of paper money. This is the process of financial evolution. However, the exchange of money still takes goods as the standard, such as agriculture and fishing as the source of production, crafts as the place of manufacturing, and trade as the profession of merchants. Agriculture, industry, and commerce all rely on the injection of money. If financial circulation can be achieved, industry will naturally become more and more developed. If industry is developed, the economy of the society will naturally be prosperous, and the wealth and strength of the country can be expected. Since ancient times, economists have regarded the development of industry as the fundamental plan. It is for this reason that we and others have established the Ningbo Industrial Bank, not focusing on selfishness and self-interest as the goal, but wanting the agriculture, fishing, industry, and commerce of our Ningbo to jointly seek the development of production, and wanting to benefit China as well as Ningbo. Therefore, less than two years after opening, in addition to the Shanghai head office, a branch was established in Ningbo, and a sub-branch was established</p>

<p>A branch was established in Shenjiamen and Suzhou, and a sub-branch was established in Kunshan. In other places such as Hankou and Hangzhou, either a branch or an office was established. In the future, business will gradually expand, and industry will become more and more developed. This is the humble intention of us and others. Now, because the old site is narrow and insufficient for office use, we have moved to the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road on the Great Horse Road. Fearing that all sectors of society have not yet been fully informed, we have written this preface to explain the origin.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The 20th Anniversary of the New China Bank <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>A Half-Month Celebration Starts Today</p>
<p>The New China Trust and Savings Bank was established in the third year of the Republic of China and was founded by the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China. It is the oldest savings bank in China, with a long history of credit and remarkable achievements over the years. In addition to the head office in Shanghai, branches and offices are located in Nanjing, Beijing, Tianjin, Xiamen, Suzhou, and Shanghai. Recently, the bank has reached its 20th anniversary, and a 20th-anniversary celebration will be held from the 1st to the 15th of this month to mark the occasion. The main anniversary events are listed below: (1) Promoting anniversary business: The bank's business has always been based on prudence, innovation, and the welfare of the people. Over the years, it has created the New China Life Savings Fund, the New China Education Savings Fund, etc., which have long been widely promoted and well-received. During the anniversary period, it is heard that three commemorative businesses will be promoted: (i) Housing Loans: The bank handles housing loan business with the aim of helping the general public solve their housing problems. Anyone who has a base and lacks sufficient funds to build a house can apply to the bank for a loan in accordance with the bank's stipulated methods, based on the principle of savings and in a trust manner, agree to repay in installments, and entrust the bank to design and build it on their behalf. The method is very perfect. At this time when the housing problem is extremely serious, the bank's launch of this business will surely be able to promote it well and benefit the society. (ii) Small-Amount Credit Loans: The bank's small-amount credit loan business has been piloted for several months and has achieved considerable results. During this anniversary period, it will be actively promoted to benefit the people. The purpose of handling this loan is to help those below the middle class who use their personality and credit as collateral to obtain opportunities for accommodating funds when they are legitimately needed. Anyone who is over twenty-one years old, has good credit, is in good health, and has a legitimate job can invite two guarantors to apply to the bank for a loan for legitimate purposes. The loan per household is limited to one hundred to five hundred yuan, with a monthly interest rate of eight percent, and a maximum of twelve months to repay in installments, which is extremely convenient for the borrower. (iii) Education Savings Scholarship: In order to encourage young students to study hard and pursue further studies, the bank has specially created an education savings scholarship. Children who have subscribed to the bank's education savings and are studying at schools registered with the Ministry of Education, the Department of Education, or the Bureau of Education, with an average academic grade of 80 or above, have the opportunity to receive a scholarship. The scholarship amount is 400 yuan per year for university students, 200 yuan per year for middle school students, and 100 yuan per year for elementary school students. (2) Giving Away Anniversary Gifts: During the 20th-anniversary period, the bank will give away innovative and meaningful gifts, the "New China Tumbler" and the "New China Small Round Mirror." Anyone who opens an account at the bank's head office, branches, and offices from October 1st can obtain the gifts in accordance with the bank's specially printed gift methods, until the gifts are given away. In addition, the bank previously held an anniversary essay contest to solicit savings plans from all walks of life. The results have been selected and compiled into a book, "My Savings Plan," which was published at the end of last month. In addition to being sold by the Shanghai Life Bookstore, a portion will be set aside and distributed to depositors during the anniversary period, it is said. (3) Holding the New China Village Exhibition: The New China Village, built by the bank on Xitiyu Road in Shanghai, is largely ready with all its equipment. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the 20th anniversary, a New China Village Exhibition will be held in the village from Double Ten Day to October 15th. In addition to exhibiting various real estate construction models, patterns, materials, and home furnishings, various models, pictures, forms, and regulations related to savings and trust will also be displayed. People from all walks of life are welcome to visit. The New China Economic Talks (three types have been published: "Individuals and Banks," "Individuals and Trusts," and "Urban Living Problems"), the family budget, and "A Page in the History of Family Finance," compiled by the bank's service department, will be widely distributed at the exhibition as souvenirs. It is also heard that, in order to facilitate visitors, the bank has printed a kind of China Merchants Public Bus fare voucher, which, in addition to being sent to all sectors of society, is welcome to be obtained from the Shanghai head office and various offices of the bank, it is said.</p>

<p>Public Works Bureau</p>
<h3 id="e126">Summary of the Hygiene Department's Work <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession’s Municipal Council's Hygiene Department currently has sections for vital statistics, infectious diseases, pathological testing, veterinary medicine, markets, sanitation, licensing, and cemeteries, as well as several hospitals. However, the nature and scope of its work are not yet fully understood. Records show that the Public Concession was established in 1843. It was not until 1863 that a so-called "filth removal section" was established. In 1870, the Police Committee suggested organizing a Sanitation Department to manage medical affairs, markets, and sanitation. Dr. Henderson was then appointed as the Medical Officer of Health, and the vaccination station was also established in 1870. However, due to opposition from rumors, very few people came for vaccinations at the time. Recently, its effectiveness has greatly increased. From 1929 to 1933, the Hygiene Department vaccinated 663,128 people. In the past three years, 632,474 people have been vaccinated. In 1876, a public slaughterhouse was initially established, and the planned filling of depressions and opening of drainage ditches also began at that time. Soon after, Locke Hospital was opened, and the management of household sewage and food supply was trialed at that time, employing a part-time medical officer. The Hongkou vegetable market was also established (currently, the Municipal Council has 17 vegetable markets). In 1898, the Hygiene Department was formally established, with Dr. Danley serving as the full-time Medical Officer of Health. Chemical and pathological testing laboratories and Pasteur examination rooms were prepared, and inspection work began. The Municipal Council also sought to increase laws to restrict crowds and mandate the reporting of infectious diseases, as well as register doctors, but the taxpayers did not agree. As a result, they could only start with education and persuasion, proceeding gradually. Between 1903 and 1906, the number of trained health inspectors tripled. At the same time, isolation hospitals, disinfection stations, and other offices were also established. Since then, progress has been slower, but this was unavoidable due to the misunderstanding and fear of the public. At that time, banning the sale of substandard food on the streets and conducting door-to-door inspections for disease prevention caused major disturbances. In 1908, plague was first discovered among the Chinese, and rat catching and inspection began (now a routine task). Many rats infected with the plague were found, especially near the docks. In 1910, there were more infected people, and preventive measures were implemented, which greatly dissatisfied lower-class people. After explanation, the measures continued. Mosquito control work also began in 1910, with a special focus on publicity and education. However, without a law to forcibly fill stagnant water, it was difficult to implement. From 1912, sixteen hygiene sub-offices were established within the concession, each staffed with one inspector to facilitate contact with the public and ease administration. Between 1919 and 1921, a detailed investigation of lung diseases among Chinese prisoners in the prison was conducted. As a result, improvements were made to prisoners' food, prison conditions, detention rules, and various aspects of preventing infection. The prisoners' mortality rate decreased from 69 to 42 within two years. After the Russian Revolution, many Russians fled to Shanghai, adding many problems to the sanitation work for foreigners. Regarding health education, there were fixed lectures for Chinese schoolchildren, with lecturers going to various schools at different times. Slogans and brochures in Chinese, English, Japanese, and Russian were compiled, revised, and distributed to the public at different times. In addition, a set of health films was produced and shown in cinemas at any time. Due to the sharp increase in the Chinese and Western population, the Hygiene Department had to be completely reorganized from 1921, adopting the latest European and American administrative systems with appropriate modifications to adapt to the environment. However, the frequent wars and unstable political situation, coupled with the government changes in 1926 and 1927, greatly affected the progress of administration. From 1921 to 1930, the collection and disposal of garbage and filth were transferred to the Public Works Department. As a result, the Hygiene Department could pay more attention to the supervision of food, milk, and vegetable markets. At this time, the instruments in the pathological and chemical laboratories were updated. The products of the laboratories, such as smallpox vaccine and rabies injections, have been promoted throughout China. In 1931, a qualified veterinarian was hired, and the supply of milk and meat inspection saw further progress. The standard of milk produced by dairies is the first class in the Orient. The Dairy Investigation Committee is also considering how to disinfect all milk for drinking. Its report will be published soon. The Municipal Council, in consultation with medical associations of various nationalities, formed a Shanghai Medical Committee in 1931. On April 1 of that year, a physician registration regulation was promulgated, and registered physicians, dentists, and veterinarians were registered, and their names, qualifications, etc. were compiled into a book and published in the gazette as a basis for recognition. The Municipal Council runs a foreign isolation hospital, a Chinese isolation hospital, a mental hospital, a tuberculosis sanatorium, a police hospital, a prison hospital, and free clinics, etc. From 1930 to 1931, a medical investigation committee was dispatched, and its report has been adopted in principle. Based on its recommendations, a western tropical disease hospital and a neurological hospital are currently planned, and the subsidies for non-municipal hospitals have also been increased. In December of last year, a new slaughterhouse was completed. The slaughterhouse can accommodate 1,000 cattle, 1,500 sheep, 300 calves, and 500 pigs. The lighting, ventilation, and comfort of the pens meet modern conditions. As for slaughter, the latest and most humane methods are used. All procedures are supervised by inspectors. The daily slaughter capacity can reach 250 to 300 cattle, 500 sheep, 100 calves, and 300 pigs. If demand is extremely high, it can be increased without affecting supervision. Currently, pig and sheep slaughtering is still done by private slaughterhouses, but the municipal slaughterhouse has prepared a full expansion. The tools will be tripled soon, and this activity will be centralized. Meat that has been inspected and is suitable for consumption is stamped with a mark. The slaughterhouse is equipped with a sick animal and waste meat disposal facility to prevent this spoiled meat from harming the public. The products after disposal can be used as raw materials for commodities. The Municipal Council has long planned to conduct physical examinations for schoolchildren. Recently, a doctor has been specially hired to start a pilot program in a Chinese elementary school. The Hygiene Department is well aware that in near-tropical agricultural areas, the sources of infection are mostly water and food. To cope with this, it is necessary to establish large-scale laboratories and hire a large number of inspectors. Although preventive measures take effect slowly, the quality of drinking water in this concession is no worse than that in cities with better conditions. Regarding other issues, the Hygiene Department believes that it is better to take an educational approach and proceed gradually than to impose strong regulations that cannot be implemented. Fortunately, due to this strategy, the general public and businesses have recognized the necessity of various sanitation methods. However, matters such as urban design, infant welfare, and factory inspection are still in the embryonic stage, just starting to collect and organize materials. However, when the time comes for effective action, they can be dealt with immediately. As for the investigation of the causes of death and the nature of epidemics, it is an ancillary task of the Hygiene Department, but attention is also paid to research. Because the public is unwilling to report, the records of deaths are difficult to be accurate. Or, some believe that Shanghai is the center of various diseases. This is because the investigation and statistics of this port are more detailed than those of neighboring areas, leading to this misunderstanding. When epidemics occur in other areas, they are not investigated in detail, or even not discovered. When they spread to this port, they are found out. Therefore, although the classification method of this port is not perfect, it also has this effect. The complex situation of the Hygiene Department in cracking down on various harmful things in large cities cannot be described in detail now. However, the duties of some sections of this department are the work of other departments in more densely organized cities, such as the laboratory doing analysis work for hospitals and doctors, and the duties that belong to national laboratories in other countries. Also, the expenses of infectious disease hospitals are all borne by the Hygiene Department.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Construction Begins on the Pudong National Products Exhibition <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Entertainers to Join the Performance to Increase Guest Interest</p>
<p>A Meeting of Manufacturers' Representatives Was Held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA</p>
<p>Since the China National Products Improvement Society began actively preparing for the Pudong National Products Exhibition, everything is nearing completion. The number of registered manufacturers has increased to more than 80. At the same time, in order to open on schedule and proceed quickly, the society has hired more than 180 workers to start construction at the exhibition site and speed up work to avoid digging a well only when thirsty and being rushed at the last minute. The exhibition site is located between Dongchang Road and the Bingtian Factory in Pudong, covering an area of 20 mu, which is unusually vast. The location is also convenient and easily accessible. Therefore, domestic goods manufacturers are happy to participate. The society has negotiated with Mr. Zhang Shangzhen, manager of Pudong Bank, that the daily business income of the participating manufacturers can be handed over to the bank for remittance, so as to avoid the inconvenience of carrying and all the troubles. On the one hand, it seeks to increase the interest of guests and attract manufacturers to do business. For the attached entertainment section, in addition to dozens of famous actors such as Zeng Yanxiang, Xue Yunxia, Cao Yifeng, and Ge Cuiyun who are willing to take on the performance, the exhibition period is three weeks long, and they are deeply afraid that it will be insufficient. Therefore, entertainment masters from all over the country who are willing to promote domestic goods and do their duty together are still in contact. (No matter what kind of entertainment, individuals or groups, if interested in participating, will be sincerely welcomed. Contact: No. 692 Niuzhuang Road, intersection of Zhejiang Road, telephone 95017, and Pudong Fifth District Party Department, telephone Pudong No. 5). A reporter visited Mr. Li, the executive director of the society, yesterday. According to him, the people of Pudong have little knowledge of domestic goods. This exhibition in the area will make a deeper impression on the excellence of domestic goods, which is expected. Moreover, Pudong has a strong purchasing power for daily necessities, but it is inconvenient to cross the river. Therefore, it is expected that the results of this time will be guaranteed. He continued that before the opening, it was originally intended to invite the press to report on the organization of the National Products Exhibition and its motives. However, due to the rush of preparation, it was only possible to wait a while. After the opening, an invitation would be sent. In recent days, a notice will be issued to convene participating manufacturers to hold a meeting of manufacturers' representatives on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA on Min Ti Ni Yin Road to decide on future measures. According to Secretary Zhu, the exhibition site is meticulously set up. The fire protection, security, inspection, and the installation of fire extinguishers and fire trucks inside and outside the site are well protected.</p>

<p>Planning to Establish a Branch to Benefit Citizens</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Temporary Drug Rehabilitation Center has been established for just three months, and the number of drug addicts who have been rehabilitated has exceeded 700. There are also more than 300 people who voluntarily seek drug rehabilitation. Its remarkable achievements can be seen. The center officially announced its establishment yesterday and invited people from all walks of life to visit. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e130">A Glimpse Inside the Center <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The center has not yet officially opened. The official opening was at 2:00 pm yesterday, without any ceremony. More than 200 representatives from all walks of life, including Xu Peihuang and Li Dachao, attended. At 2:00 pm, all visitors were served tea and refreshments by the center's director Yang Yannian, doctor Wu Liguo, and Shen Gao, section chief of the Health Bureau. They were then led to visit the drug rehabilitation wards. There are six rooms, housing a total of 108 drug addicts. There is also a medicine storage room, where doctors take turns serving. Some have been completely rehabilitated, while others are undergoing rehabilitation with the effervescent drug rehabilitation method. The drug addicts' clothing and meals are provided by the center. All the facilities are very well-equipped. The visitors were very satisfied.</p>

<p>The center also admitted a Russian expatriate who voluntarily requested drug rehabilitation, named Jin Si guiue. He had been smoking for about 8 years, and his teeth were already charred. He had to smoke 4 qian of red pills and 120 pills every day, which cost a lot every month. He worked at the tram company. Due to economic difficulties, he once tried to quit, but after only five months, he became addicted again. Now he is determined to voluntarily request rehabilitation again. Since entering the center, his drug addiction has been completely eliminated in less than ten days. He can be discharged in two or three days. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency asked him yesterday if he had any pain when quitting drugs. Jin Si replied with a smile that there was no pain at all, and said that he would do his best to publicize after being discharged, so that all smokers could completely escape from the sea of suffering.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Planning to Establish a Branch <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>According to the center authorities, the center sees that the number of people voluntarily requesting drug rehabilitation is increasing day by day, and the temporary drug rehabilitation center is not spacious enough. Therefore, Wu Tiecheng, the concurrent commander, Tao Baichuan, the chief of the Military Law Department, and Li Ting'an, the director of the Health Bureau, are purchasing two mu of land on Qingyun Road in Zhabei to build the second branch. According to Section Chief Shen, the branch can accommodate 100 to 200 people. If the number of people is too large, management will be difficult. As for the construction date, it has not yet been decided, but the foundation has already been purchased.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Center's Funding <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>According to the center's published information on the establishment process, after the chairman of the Central Military Commission promulgated the drug rehabilitation regulations, the municipal government and the Songhu Garrison Command strictly searched for drug addicts. As the number of people detained increased day by day, in order to fundamentally rehabilitate drug addicts, Mayor Wu, who was also the Songhu Garrison Commander, allocated 10,000 yuan for start-up expenses and 2,800 yuan per month for recurring expenses, specifically for the drug addicts detained by the Military Law Department of the Garrison Command and those who voluntarily sought drug rehabilitation. A municipal drug rehabilitation center was established and handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau for preparation and supervision of drug rehabilitation matters. On June 26, work began in the detention center, first using extremely simple methods to rehabilitate addicts. Later, the Garrison Department allocated three large bungalows near Longhua as the site. Because the houses were dilapidated, in addition to the complete repair, offices, staff dormitories, kitchens, laundry rooms, etc. were added, along with sanitary equipment, water and electricity renovations, totaling 7,000 yuan. Other medical equipment, medicines, and clothing for drug addicts totaled 3,000 yuan. By the time the center's drug rehabilitation center was completed, 732 addicts had been rehabilitated.</p>

<p>The center is located at 2511 Longhua Road, opposite the Songhu Garrison Department. There are 14 bungalows, a total of 6 large and small wards, which can accommodate 100 people. There are two offices, two staff dormitories, one kitchen, one laundry room, and two toilets. Criminals and volunteers are admitted at the same time, all free of charge. There is one director, one chief medical officer, one resident doctor, one pharmacist, three nurses, one nursing student, one clerk, one general affairs officer, and one administrator. In addition to the medical personnel being responsible for the medical aspects of managing drug addicts, security guards are sent by the Garrison Command to be responsible for other surveillance matters.</p>
<p>Yip Pun Heung Hotel Expresses</p>
<h3 id="e136">Japanese Merchants Once Booked Dishes <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Fear of Misunderstanding, Now Declined</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and other Japanese trading merchants, in order to develop Japanese goods in the East Asian market, are competing to hold a Japanese goods exhibition in Shanghai, China. It is scheduled to hold a Japanese goods exhibition at the Yip Pun Heung Hotel on Xizang Road in the city from October 7 to 9, inviting Chinese merchants from Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Wuhan, and other places to browse. A Datong News Agency reporter visited Zhang Pingxun, the accountant of the Yip Pun Heung Hotel on Xizang Road, yesterday afternoon. According to Zhang, two weeks ago, a Mr. Wang from the Japanese Consulate came to the hotel to book seven tables of Chinese dishes, inviting guests to the downstairs grand dining room of the hotel on the evening of October 7. At that time, a Mr. Sun from the hotel was in contact with him. As for its purpose, the hotel is a business, and there was no way to ask at the time. Unexpectedly, a letter signed by the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association was suddenly received yesterday, stating that there was an exhibition. The hotel was deeply afraid of a misunderstanding, so it declined. Zhang also said that, according to the above situation, it seemed to be a dinner party. As for the exhibition, it is probably not likely. This kind of behavior that violates the emotions of the Chinese people is unlikely to be patronized.</p>
<p>Still Unfolding a Fiery Umbrella in Deep Autumn</p>
<h3 id="e137">Emergency Hospital Closes <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Started on July 3, Ends Today</p>
<p>More Than 3,000 Patients, Deaths Account for 3 Percent</p>
<p>This summer, due to severe drought and heat, all seasonal epidemic hospitals started early. The number of people admitted to the hospital was high, and the diagnosis and treatment was quite busy. Now that the weather has entered deep autumn and the epidemic atmosphere has subsided, the Emergency Epidemic Hospital on North Xizang Road in the city has closed yesterday. The hospital's closing report is recorded below. This year, the hospital</p>
<h3 id="e138">Started on July 3 <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Receiving patients on July 9, ending on September 30. There were a total of 2,190 outpatient visits and 566 inpatients. Among them, due to the sudden hot weather in July, there were 1,141 outpatient visits and 231 inpatients. In August, there were 1,119 outpatient visits and 240 inpatients. In September, the weather turned cooler, and the number of patients also decreased, with only 488 outpatient visits and 91 inpatients. There were 6 deaths in July, 8 deaths in August, and 5 deaths in September, for a total of 19 deaths, accounting for</p>
<h3 id="e139">Total Inpatients <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Slightly less than 3 percent. Statistics for the three months show that acute enteritis was the most common seasonal epidemic disease, followed by dysentery, acute gastroenteritis, and heatstroke. In terms of miscellaneous diseases, indigestion and colds were the most common. As for the deaths, most were due to severe or prolonged heatstroke and malignant bacterial dysentery, which made it impossible to save them. Regarding epidemic prevention, a total of 787 people were injected with cholera and typhoid vaccine at the hospital. The hospital sent people to inject at places such as Chinese and Western pharmacies, Lixing Tobacco Branch, and Dada Steamship Company, totaling 413 people, for a total of 1,200 people. The medical situation is reported as above.</p>
<p>Industrial Experiment Institute Trials</p>
<h3 id="e140">Pure Bamboo Pulp Paper Sample <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Sodium Sulfide Used Instead of Caustic Soda</p>
<p>Continue to Try to Make Other Paper Using This Pulp</p>
<p>In recent years, many paper mills have been established in the country. In addition to extracting pulp by the old method, bamboo pulp and wood pulp are mostly supplied by foreign goods, which cost a lot every year. With the Ministry of Industry's large-scale paper mill about to be established, the paper-making experiment is being actively carried out by the Industrial Experiment Institute, with the goal of recovering the rights and interests. It is learned that the institute's pure bamboo pulp, bleached and copied into paper sample, was completed the day before yesterday. Because it is a semi-industrial experiment, the paper output is very small. The bamboo pulp is cooked using sodium sulfide instead of part of the caustic soda. The cooking time is shorter than using all caustic soda, and the resulting bamboo pulp is also easier to bleach. It is estimated that 350 catties of bamboo can produce more than 130 catties of pulp. Now that the institute has successfully copied, it will continue to use this pure bamboo pulp to try to make other types of paper.</p>

<p>Rumors that the Illness Has Recovered Are Not Accurate</p>
<p>Guards Protect Li's Ward Closely</p>
<p>Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, was sentenced by the local court for illegally signing a mortgage contract. The details of the appeals and trials have been reported in the newspapers. However, Li suffered from illness in prison, and because of his old age, he feared that the illness would worsen. He requested to seek medical treatment outside the prison. After the forensic doctor verified that it was true, he went to the Shanghai Public Hospital on Duojia Road in the South City for treatment. A Datong News Agency reporter visited the hospital because it was recently rumored that Li's health had recovered and that he would soon be discharged from the hospital. According to Dr. Zhang Songyun of the hospital, Li's condition is still the same, and the recovery is not accurate. Dr. Zhang also said that Li suffers from rheumatism, and because of his old age, it is difficult to achieve success even with careful treatment. After Dr. Zhang finished speaking, he showed Li's recent diagnosis, listing the pulse at around 80, the body temperature at 37, the blood pressure at 100, the condition of rheumatism, insomnia, and constipation. A Datong News Agency reporter also learned that Li's ward is monitored by ten policemen sent by the Public Security Bureau at the request of the court, and the protection is tight. At the same time, relatives and friends are prohibited from visiting.</p>
<p>Old Man as Daughter-in-Law</p>
<h3 id="e142">Dispute Over Birthday Celebration <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Suspected Mystification in Invitation Draft</p>
<p>Anonymous Letter with Ulterior Motives</p>
<p>Li Penglin, a "playboy" residing at No. 4, Gonghe Lane, Yangjia Village, Xinkaihe, intended to celebrate the 20th birthday of his daughter-in-law, Xiao Fenzi. He asked his friend, Ni Chongshou, to draft a banquet invitation. Ni felt it unprecedented for a father-in-law to celebrate his daughter-in-law's birthday. He had Li A'yu, the son of Li Penglin, formally announce that a birthday feast would be held at their residence on the 18th day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar, from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM. Hundreds of invitations were sent out, with many more taken by apprentices for distribution. Later, someone told Li that the invitation was poorly written. Li suspected Ni of deliberately mystifying things and colluded with Zheng Guangzhao to send an anonymous letter cursing Ni Chongshou in vile terms. Upon receiving the letter, Ni believed that Li Penglin had intentionally instigated Zheng Guangzhao to damage his reputation. He then commissioned lawyer Ji Dengyi of Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao, French Concession, to send a letter to Li Penglin on behalf of Ni Chongshou, demanding that he contact the lawyer's office within three days of receiving the letter. After receiving the official letter from lawyer Ji, Li claimed that he had not instructed Zheng Guangzhao to damage Ni's reputation. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, Li's wife, Qin, brought Zheng Guangzhao, along with lawyer Ji's letter and the invitation, to the Second Precinct of the First District for investigation. After questioning by Chief Liu, Zheng Guangzhao denied sending the anonymous letter. However, the case lacked sufficient witnesses, and there was a suspicion of hidden motives. The case was adjourned pending further investigation and verification.</p>
<p>Japanese Man in Manchuria Swindles Large Sum of Money</p>

<p>Fukuda and His Mistress Use Ruthless Tactics</p>
<p>Swindling a Huge Sum of 5,000 Yuan in Cash</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language "Daily News," the Japanese Consulate Police Department arrested a fraud suspect named Fukuda and his mistress in the French Concession on the morning of the 29th. Their housemates were also taken in for questioning. It was found that the two had used ruthless tactics in Manchuria to swindle 5,000 yuan in cash and secretly fled to Shanghai. The details of the case are quite bizarre. According to the Manchurian police report, the suspect's photograph showed two webbed fingers. Fukuda's original hometown was Wakayama Prefecture, but he claimed to be from Ishikawa Prefecture. His age was 34, but he claimed to be 30. Furthermore, his mistress did not even know his real name. Judging from her demeanor, she certainly had the air of a dance star, but she claimed, "I don't know anything about dancing." However, they arrived in Shanghai on the Dalian Maru on August 20th without reporting to the Consulate General. Based on their strange words and actions, it is believed that they are undoubtedly the real culprits. The Police Department is currently conducting a serious interrogation.</p>

<p>Quarrel Between Husband and Wife Causes Trouble</p>
<p>Cai Fugeng, a 22-year-old local resident, lives in a bungalow on Binlang Road in Western Shanghai. He earns a living as a driver. He married Chen, who is 20 years old and has a beautiful appearance. They have been married for just over a year, and the couple has been very affectionate and has never had any conflicts. However, on the night of September 21st, Fugeng drank a little alcohol and had a sudden argument with Chen over a trivial matter. Chen, in a moment of anger, left without saying goodbye at 5:00 AM the next morning (the 22nd). She temporarily stayed at the home of her relative, Wang Yousheng, in Zhuangqiao Village, Nanxiang, intending to stay for a couple of days to punish her husband's temper. Unexpectedly, Chen fell ill and was only able to get out of bed on the 27th. Anxious to return home, she accompanied her neighbor's young sister, Jin Di (16 years old), to Shanghai by public bus. After getting off the bus on Maishan Road in Zhabei, it was already dark. The two women walked and discussed how to deal with their husbands. Unfortunately, while walking slowly on Robert Road in Western Shanghai near the Big Ben clock, close to 1:00 AM, they encountered two acquaintances from the underworld, Jin Fa and Wang Xiaogan. After talking, Jin said that it was late and that her husband, Fugeng, was angry, so why not stay in a hotel for the night to discuss the matter further. The two women believed him and went to the nearby Zhongxing Hotel. The two women booked Room 14, and Jin and Wang also booked Room 18. In an instant, Jin dragged Jin Di into his room, locked the door, and raped her. Wang Xiaogan also sneaked into Chen's room and forcibly raped her. This continued for two nights. On the morning of the 29th, Jin Fa took Jin Di out and had not returned by the evening. Chen questioned Jin Fa, who said she was at the New Shanghai Hotel. Chen immediately hired a car and rushed to the hotel but could not find her. Chen decided to wait there and booked Room 13, staying overnight. This morning, Chen was still unable to find her. Anxious, Chen left the hotel and was going to look for her at Zhongxing Hotel when her husband, Cai Fugeng, suddenly saw her on Robert Road. He called the police, who arrested her and took her to the Sixth District. After questioning by the district officer, it was determined that the case warranted further investigation to find the missing girl and the two perpetrators.</p>

<p>Sichuan Province Oil Merchants Suspend Operations Due to Increased Oil Taxes</p>
<p>Since the kerosene market in China has been invaded by British, American, and Russian oil merchants, they have divided the oil sales areas in China and engaged in aggressive dumping. Recently, seeing that China's customs duties are gradually becoming autonomous and that there is a possibility of changes in import tariffs, they are actively shipping large quantities to China for stockpiling to avoid high import taxes. In border areas, due to excessive miscellaneous taxes hindering business, sales are temporarily suspended. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>According to people in the kerosene industry, the local branches of Asiatic Petroleum, Standard Oil, and Texaco have recently been shipping and stockpiling as much kerosene in China as possible, in anticipation of potential changes in China's import tariffs and to avoid high tax rates. The Guanghua Kerosene Company, the agency for Russian oil, has stockpiles totaling over one million cases in Hankou, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other ports. Asiatic Petroleum and Standard Oil each have stockpiles of over two million cases in China. The total national stockpile is around six million cases, enough to meet the national demand for half a year.</p>

<p>According to the Jianghai Customs, the number of imports to Shanghai and Hong Kong in August of this year are as follows: 1,589 liters from Japan, worth 150 gold units; 2,790,661 liters from the Dutch East Indies, worth 133,727 gold units; 7,092,781 liters from the United States, worth 281,199 gold units; 76,708 liters from the Soviet Union, worth 3,068 gold units; 11,263 liters from other countries, worth 2,346 gold units. The total is 9,973,002 liters, worth 420,530 gold units. After deducting 976,130 liters that were re-exported, the net import is 8,996,872 liters, worth 352,388 gold units.</p>

<p>It is also learned that Sichuan has suffered from years of internal strife and military disasters, resulting in as many as 100 types of miscellaneous taxes. Kerosene is a daily necessity for the people, so in addition to the regular tax rates levied by various provinces, an additional two yuan is added for every ten gallons. Although the oil companies in China have petitioned the Tax Affairs Department to find a way to abolish this tax, no concrete measures have been announced. Therefore, they plan to temporarily suspend transporting kerosene into Sichuan for sale.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Accuses Husband of Sodomy <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Medical Examination Finds No Evidence</p>
<p>Court Rules Against the Plaintiff</p>
<p>Lu Qinchi, also known as Lu Rongsheng, a local resident living at No. 20, Anqing Lane, Huishan Road, married Xin Ruidi (19 years old), the second daughter of Xin Lizhong, who lives at No. 29, Lao Yuanji Lane, Tangshan Road, as a concubine last September, for a dowry of 600 yuan. Recently, Xin Ruidi and her father filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing Lu Qinchi of violating human morality by sodomizing Ruidi, demanding the dissolution of their cohabitation relationship and payment of 5,000 yuan in damages. The details of the case were reported in this newspaper on the 7th of this month. The civil court of the First Special Court, presided over by Judge Qiao Wanxuan, continued the hearing on the afternoon of the previous day. The plaintiff, Xin Ruidi, and her lawyer, Fan Ming, and the defendant, Lu Qinchi, and his defense lawyer, Chen Tingrui, were all present in court. Lu Qinchi completely denied the accusations, saying that the plaintiff had left him four or five months ago and that this lawsuit was a "pigeon release" scheme to defraud him of money. To clarify the facts, the court instructed Ruidi to undergo a medical examination, but Ruidi claimed to be menstruating. Lawyer Chen also stated that the defendant and the plaintiff had not lived together for four or five months, during which time evidence could be falsified. If the examination results showed no evidence of sodomy, it would be clear that the accusation was false. Even if evidence of sodomy was found, it could not be proven that it was the defendant's actions. The court determined that the facts could not be clarified without an examination, so Ruidi was sent to the forensic department for examination. The examination revealed that Ruidi only had evidence of hemorrhoids and no evidence of sodomy. The truth of the matter was revealed. The court then allowed both parties to begin their arguments. Lawyer Chen launched a fierce attack on the plaintiff's lawsuit. After the closing arguments, Judge Qiao immediately announced the verdict, dismissing the plaintiff's lawsuit.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Handling the Transportation and Sale of Fritillaria Bulbs <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Annual Overproduction Causes Farmers to Be Unable to Make Ends Meet</p>
<p>Economic Stability Will Allow Direct Sales to Various Regions</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, after the closure of the traditional Chinese medicine shops selling Fritillaria bulbs (象貝), the Traditional Chinese Medicine associations decided to use Qianhu (前胡) instead of Fritillaria until the Fritillaria situation is resolved. The Ningbo Association in Shanghai has called for mediation, which has not been successful. According to members of the Dongjiang Cooperative, the situation regarding the transportation and sale of Fritillaria bulbs is as follows:</p>
<p>Fritillaria Production and Sales: Fritillaria is produced in Zhangcun Village, Yinxian County, Zhejiang Province. Due to soil conditions, the production area is not large. The annual production is about 700,000 to 800,000 catties, and the annual sales are about 500,000 catties. In the past, there was a risk of overproduction, which led to low prices. There are 5,873 Fritillaria-producing households. Each household produces an average of more than 100 catties per year, which barely supports a family. The cost of each 100 catties of Fritillaria is as follows: seeds 40 yuan, land rent 13 yuan, fertilizer 6 yuan, labor 10 yuan, totaling 69 yuan. The Fritillaria produced by farmers is purchased by merchants, resold to medicine stores, then sold by medicine stores to pharmacies, and finally sold by pharmacies to patients. After being exploited by middlemen, the farmers' income is hardly enough to cover their costs.</p>
<p>Organization of the Cooperative: Farmers who grow Fritillaria realized that they were being exploited by merchants and that they could only protect their costs by collectively transporting and selling their products and eliminating the middlemen. Therefore, they spontaneously organized a cooperative. The entire amount of Fritillaria is collected and not purchased with money, and it is all concentrated together. The cooperative was formally established on March 1, 1933. In accordance with current cooperative regulations, an application was submitted to the competent authorities for approval. The Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department has assigned personnel to the cooperative to provide guidance on all administrative facilities. All proposals are decided by the General Assembly of Member Representatives and implemented after approval by the authorities. Three percent of the funds are taken from the proceeds, and the surplus is used as a public reserve. The Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department has set the price at 150 yuan per 100 catties on the market scale, taking into account both the producers and consumers. Each batch of proceeds is distributed equally among the members based on the amount concentrated. The nature of the cooperative is absolutely different from that of a business.</p>
<p>Current Transportation and Sales Situation: Because the cooperative concentrates the goods, it is necessary to distribute some funds to the members first. Since there are no large-scale buyers for the goods at one time, it is necessary to mortgage the goods to the bank for a loan. The bank believes that the prices of medicines fluctuate and require reliable medicine shops to guarantee the loan. Therefore, the four Ningbo medicine shops agreed to guarantee the mortgage loan for the cooperative and entered into a mutually beneficial sales agreement. This is a major drawback of the cooperative's economic control at the beginning of its establishment. However, this is a necessary stage in the cooperative's struggle. Therefore, the first step is to enter into a sales contract with medicine shops to eliminate the merchant class, increase farmers' income, and not increase the burden on patients at all. When the cooperative's economy is not controlled, it will implement the second step: eliminating the medicine shop class and directly transporting and selling to various ports. Since its establishment, the cooperative has concentrated 1,258,000 catties of surplus Fritillaria. Last year, it sold 500,000 catties, which at an average price of 100 yuan per 100 catties, totals 500,000 yuan. If this amount is distributed among 1,258,000 catties, the farmers' income is only 40 yuan per 100 catties, which is less than the cost. Even if the entire amount is sold, the profit per 100 catties is only 30 to 40 yuan.</p>
<p>Mediation of Disputes: The long-term cause of the Shanghai pharmaceutical industry's opposition to the cooperative this time is due to the fact that the industry association once opposed the cooperative last year. The cooperative compromised and gave them tens of thousands of catties of low-priced Fritillaria. This year, after the matter passed, they again accused the cooperative of monopolizing the market, using the excuse of reducing the burden on patients, and proposed to reject the use of Fritillaria, destroying the cooperative. After this case occurred, Tang Xunze, a cooperative specialist from the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, and the Shanghai Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau mediated several times, repeatedly explaining the situation. However, the mediation was unsuccessful because the representatives of the association demanded a special price reduction. Those with clear eyes can see what their intentions are.</p>

The Committee has sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the Jianghai Customs to absolutely detain any films that do not have an export permit issued by the Committee. It has been learned that after receiving the letter, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Jianghai Customs Supervisor to instruct the Tax Affairs Department that all locally produced films reported for export must have an export permit from the Film Inspection Committee. Otherwise, they will be detained and submitted by the Tax Affairs Department to the Film Inspection Committee for review.</p>

<p>All in Critical Condition</p>
<p>A traveler came to the Mengyuan Hotel on Hubei Road at around 10:00 AM on the 28th of the previous day. He was wearing a long gown made of homespun cloth and looked like a student. He claimed to be Shen Yufeng, 19 years old, from Shaoxing, and wanted to book a room. The porter led him upstairs and opened Room 331. He paid a room rate of three yuan, booked for two days, and nothing unusual happened. Until 2:00 PM yesterday, due to feeling economically pressured, he had a sudden impulse to die and secretly took a large dose of opium to kill himself. The porter noticed and quickly sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. His life is still in danger. (2) Huang Youzhang, a 27-year-old from Chongming, who used to work at the Tianlu Tea and Food Shop at the stolen chicken bridge entrance on North Zhejiang Road, committed suicide by poisoning himself at home at around 1:00 PM yesterday due to being unemployed for too long and having financial difficulties. He had an argument with his wife and became resentful. He was discovered and sent to Renji Hospital by car. (3) A young traveler came to the Ningkang Hotel on North Zhejiang Road the night before. He said that his name was Zhu Pingshan, 27 years old, and he was a businessman. He booked a small room, closed the door, and went to bed. Until yesterday afternoon, he had not gotten up. The porters became suspicious and tried to open the door, catching a glimpse of him with an abnormal complexion and incoherent speech. They reported to the Haining Road Police Station, who sent an ambulance to Tongren Hospital. After examination by the doctor, it was found that he had taken opium. He was given an injection and had his stomach pumped, and he was out of danger. He was then taken back to the police station for disposal.</p>

<p>Last year marked the 300th anniversary of the death of Xu Wending Gong (Guangqi), the Ming Dynasty's State Preceptor, in Shanghai. Scholars at home and abroad published numerous memorial articles, which were printed in national newspapers and magazines. These are truly valuable materials for those who study Wending Gong. The Shanghai Xujiahui Catholic Magazine Society has recently compiled these articles into a single volume, making it even easier for scholars to review them. The society has also re-printed Zhang Xingyao's "Brief Biography of Xu Guangqi," written in the Kangxi year of Wuwu, from the National Library of Paris and included it in the compilation. Also included are three articles from Xu's genealogy, "Wending Gong's Family Biography," which were written by contemporaries. All of the above articles are rare materials not available elsewhere. The beginning of the compilation includes multiple pages of inscriptions by political and academic figures. This compilation can be obtained from the society for a postage and printing fee of 25 cents. The society also published a special Shanghai edition of Xu last year, which is also a collection of writings commemorating Wending Gong. There are still copies available, which can be obtained for a postage fee of 20 cents.</p>

<p>Compiled by the Reading Guidance Department of the Shenbao Circulation Library</p>
<p>Table of Contents</p>
<p>(1) News from the YMCA Reading Club</p>
<p>(2) Recommendation of the inaugural issue of Taibai</p>
<p>(1) YMCA Reading Club Recruiting New Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA has organized several reading clubs to encourage young people to read and develop their ability to explore issues. During the three-month trial period in the past, the members have shown a strong interest in reading, and each person has benefited greatly from mutual criticism. Now that the first phase has come to an end, new members will be recruited again from now until the end of September. Anyone who is interested in reading can report to join the club. The membership fee for this phase is only 30 cents.</p>
<p>Recommendation of the inaugural issue of Taibai</p>
<p>Among the many small publications produced under the so-called "Magazine Year," Taibai is definitely one of the most noteworthy. This inaugural issue, with approximately 70,000 words, contains 37 articles divided into sections such as "Short Essays," "Sketches," "Casual Talks," "Scientific Essays," "Customs Records," and "Miscellaneous Studies." Half of the twelve short essays are about the issue of the common language. This issue is still being discussed theoretically and is now entering the stage of concrete construction. The opinions in these short essays are also very valuable for reference. The scientific essay can be read together with the scientific essays in the back.</p>
<p>The "Dialect Records" in the "Casual Talks" section can be read together with the articles discussing language in the front. The articles "Remembering Mr. Huang Xiaoquan" and "Version" have nothing to do with the actual lives of ordinary people, but the remaining four articles are all very good, especially "Humorous Street Vendor Voices" and "Briefly Discussing Intermediate Readings," which are more brilliant. The former records two unnoticed details in hundreds of words, which can make people feel deeply meaningful after reading; the latter discusses the so-called "intermediate reading" publications that are neither exclusively "hard" nor purely "soft."</p>
<p>The most noteworthy parts of the inaugural issue of Taibai are the "Sketches" and "Scientific Essays" sections, and we can also see that it places special emphasis on these two sections. Sketches are the original form of short essays, which have been very popular abroad. Their advantage lies in using the most concise language to describe the various aspects of society. At the same time, they are also a good way to cultivate the literary writing skills of young people in general. As for the advocacy of scientific essays, in the current situation where everyone is calling for the popularization of science, it is undoubtedly very important. Now we want to move science from the foreign building to the street, so that the public knows that science is not something mysterious and that everyone has the right to enjoy it.</p>
<p>All six short articles in this "Sketches" section can make people feel quite satisfied. "Great Drought" and "A Jiu and His Cow" both describe this year's drought, but the materials used are different. One focuses on the record of the rural social situation, and the other focuses on the description of the life of farmers. From these two articles, which together do not exceed 5,000 words, we have already seen the various aspects of the drought. Such techniques of material selection and structure are worth noting for young people who aspire to literature. The other articles, such as "A Rickshaw Puller," "Summer Notes," and "Marriage," all use concise language to describe the details of a certain corner of society, making people feel like they are tasting olives, with a special flavor.</p>
<p>Scientific essays are still a newborn child in China, so the four articles here cannot make people feel very satisfied, although they are all written based on what they have seen and heard. They lack literary descriptions and can only be regarded as popular explanations of scientific common sense. This work was originally a very difficult task, and it is even more difficult in China, where science is not developed. Because if you are a true and practical scientist, but you don't have literary cultivation, it won't work. And ordinary writers do not have in-depth research on science. We know that the four authors here are already some of the most important science writers in the country. But we don't have to stop our attempts because it is not easy. We want to hope that everyone will double their efforts to make science truly popular and give short essays a new life.</p>
<p>In short, this publication is worth recommending to readers at the moment. Its publishing address is the Life Bookstore on Sima Road in Shanghai, and the current special price for a full year, including postage, is two yuan.</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's newspaper, on the second page of the third sheet, sixth row, the news headline, "China National Products Factory Federation Pays Attention to the Domestic Goods Exhibition," the character "National" (國) was mistakenly printed as "Day" (日).

<p>The Central District Stadium</p>
<p>Groundbreaking Ceremony Held Today</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Personally Laid the Foundation Stone and Exhibited the Model</p>

<p>The groundbreaking ceremony for the city's grand stadium, which is expected to rival those in the Far East, will be held today in the central district. At the same time, a model of the stadium will be exhibited for public viewing. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e175">Ceremony <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>This morning at 10:00 AM, the groundbreaking ceremony for the grand stadium will be held at the stadium site in the central district. Mayor Wu, Yu Hongjun, Xue Cixin, Tong Xingbai, and Shen Tongliang will all attend. The ceremony will include: (1) Opening the meeting; (2) Chairman's speech; (3) Report; (4) Speeches; (5) Mayor Wu personally laying the foundation stone; (6) Music; (7) Conclusion. The city government will also have various models of the stadium on display at the site, starting today and continuing until the 10th, from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily. The public is welcome to visit.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Completion Next Year <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Xue Cixin, Acting Director of the Bureau of Public Works, told reporters that the architectural design of the stadium was commissioned by the Central District Construction Committee to architects Dong Dayou and assistant architect Wang Huabin, and approved by the municipal government. Bids were solicited by the bureau in July of this year. A total of eleven companies submitted bids, and Chengtai Construction Company won the bid with the lowest price. Construction began on August 1st and is scheduled to be completed in May of next year.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Well-Prepared Design <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Xue continued, "The design of the grand stadium is extremely innovative. The steel-concrete roof frame, traffic flow lines, dormitory layout, interior and exterior decoration, etc., can all serve as a reference for those designing stadiums elsewhere in the country. The stadium's scale, capacity, and completeness are all achieved with a budget of one million yuan, which demonstrates the designers' painstaking efforts."</p>
<h3 id="e178">Shanghai Municipal Stadium Project Overview <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>I. Origin</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, considering that the city's population has reached over three million, and lacking a large-scale stadium, which is insufficient to meet the needs of citizens for physical training and leisure entertainment. Furthermore, with the establishment of the new city center, it is necessary to have facilities to impress new citizens and promote the prosperity of the area. Therefore, the construction of the municipal stadium was planned, aiming to achieve both goals at once. In the early part of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), the architect's office of the Central District Construction Committee was instructed to start designing. In July of the same year, the Municipal Government obtained approval from the Central Government to issue public bonds of 3.5 million yuan, with 1 million yuan designated for the construction of the municipal stadium. This is a rough overview of the preparatory process for the construction of the Shanghai Municipal Stadium.</p>
<p>II. Location</p>
<p>Since the municipal stadium must be of a considerable scale, it requires a land area of more than 1,000 acres. To avoid requisitioning private land and to save expenses, a part of the First Park in the southwest of the central administrative district was chosen as the construction site for the stadium (No. 5 in the first diagram). It is bordered by Guohe Road to the east, Songhu Road to the west, Zhengdong Road to the north, and the Qujiang River to the south. To its south are the intersection points of the Songhu, Xiangyin, Qimei, and Huangxing four main roads. To the north is the future station where the Songhu Railway will connect to the intersection of Sanmin Road and Songhu Road, making transportation convenient.</p>
<p>III. Project Overview</p>
<p>The municipal stadium includes the currently planned sports field, gymnasium, and swimming pool, as well as the future addition of tennis courts and baseball fields (second diagram), covering an area of approximately 300 acres. The design highlights are described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Sports Field</p>
<p>The sports field (No. 1 in the second diagram) is not only for citizens' daily physical training but also for hosting school sports meets, national games, Far East Games, and even world games. The architectural form and various dimensions are mostly determined by the needs of track and field events, as well as competitions such as football, basketball, and volleyball. The site does not adopt a U-shape or circular shape but a linked shape (third diagram). If it were U-shaped, the main entrance would have to be located at the protruding end, facing the less important Zhengdong Road, which would be inappropriate. If it were circular, it would be impossible to set up a 200-meter straight track, which is needed for track races. Other design highlights have also been carefully drafted after referring to the layouts of famous stadiums in Europe and America.</p>
<p>The stand of this stadium occupies a total width of 175 meters (574 feet) and a total length of 330 meters (1,082 feet). The highest point of the stadium building is approximately 20 meters (66 feet) from the ground, and the height of the stand wall is approximately 10 meters (32 feet). The field area is approximately 37,500 square meters (404,000 square feet). The center is a football field, volleyball field, and fields for high jump, long jump, discus throw, Chinese martial arts, etc., surrounded by a running track of approximately 500 meters long. The running track branches into straight tracks on the east and west sides, each 200 meters long. Outside the running track, there are three tennis courts and three basketball courts on the north and south sides.</p>
<p>The perimeter of the stand is approximately 760 meters (2,500 feet), and the width is approximately 17 meters (55 feet), with a seating capacity of 40,000 and a standing capacity of 20,000. Its capacity is larger than that of the Nanjing Stadium (20,000 seats).</p>
<p>To ensure that tens of thousands of spectators can enter and exit quickly and in an orderly manner, two types of traffic routes are set up: (A) Circular traffic routes, divided into two lines. One is located outside the ticket collection points, i.e., the passageway surrounding the edge of the stadium (third diagram) and the sidewalks and roads (9 meters wide) around the outside of the stadium. The other is located inside the stadium, i.e., the 1.8-meter wide circular walkway on the stand. (B) Vertical traffic routes, connecting the circular traffic routes and the seats in the stand, i.e., the steps between each section of the stand, leading down to the passageway at the edge of the field and up to the edge of each seat. A total of 34 of these steps are set up, evenly distributed throughout the stadium, each allowing 1,200 people to pass. Tens of thousands of spectators can all exit within a maximum of five minutes. Each step is equipped with an iron pull door, so that ticket collectors can easily maintain order when spectators are crowded. (Note: The Nanjing Stadium uses ordinary rotating doors, which makes it difficult to maintain order when spectators are crowded.)</p>
<p>Large gates are set up in the center of the long sides of the stadium for athletes to enter and exit in formation, and vehicles can also pass through them directly into the stadium.</p>
<p>To allow spectators to have a view from the stands to all parts of the field, the floor slabs supporting the seats in the stands are arranged in a curved manner, and the slope continues to increase from bottom to top. The construction method is to increase the height of each floor level by 0.6 cm (1/4 inch) compared to the level below. The distance between the front and back seats is 71 cm (28 inches), so the area occupied by each seat is 45 cm (18 inches) wide and 70 cm (28 inches) deep. According to the aforementioned capacity, 20 rows of seats should be set up.</p>
<p>The sports field has ample accommodation, enough to accommodate 2,500 athletes to meet the needs of holding large sports events. There are also magnificent gates and lobbies, lounges, offices, exhibition rooms, visitor's offices, radio broadcasting stations, dining rooms, etc. Its complete layout is rarely surpassed by other stadiums in the world.</p>
<p>Two grandstands face each other east and west, specifically for the seats of special guests and newspaper reporters. Due to economic considerations, chairs are generally not provided in the stands, except for the grandstand under the flat roof on the west side.</p>
<p>Another special feature is the use of the space under the stands to set up shops, public toilets, and ticket offices (third diagram). The passageway around it not only helps to shield these shops from wind and sun but also provides shelter for spectators during rainstorms. According to the current plan, only half of the space under the stands is being used, and the other half is reserved for the future construction of shops, etc.</p>
<p>The sports field uses reinforced concrete as a frame and red bricks for the walls, with artificial stone for the outer wall, plinth, and coping. The east and west gates adopt a Chinese style and are made of artificial stone. The rest of the structure is quite simple.</p>
<p>The sports field has a large number of flagpoles, which are very important when holding sports events. Floodlights are set up on the field and in front of the stadium building.</p>
<p>The elevation and cross-section of this stadium can be found in the fourth and fifth diagrams.</p>
<p>(B) Gymnasium</p>
<p>This gymnasium (No. 2 in the second diagram) is not only for the needs of various indoor sports for citizens but also for gatherings, exhibitions, and theatrical performances.</p>
<p>The capacity is 3,500 seats and 1,500 standing places. Temporary seats can be added around the walls of the sports hall when necessary.</p>
<p>The sports hall is located in the center of the building, with a floor paved with maple wood. It is approximately 23 meters (63 feet) wide and 40 meters (131 feet) long, and can accommodate three ordinary basketball courts. For formal competitions, a larger court can be placed in the center, leaving more space on all sides (sixth diagram). The total width of the building is approximately 46 meters (150 feet) and the length is approximately 82 meters (270 feet).</p>
<p>The stands around the sports hall are supported by sturdy reinforced concrete beams and brick walls, approximately 11 meters (36 feet) wide, with 13 levels, each level being 66 cm (26 inches) wide and 36 cm (14 inches) to 41 cm (16 inches) high. The live load assumed during the design was 610 kg per square meter (125 pounds per square inch), and together with the static load of 120 kg per square meter (25 pounds per square foot), the total load was 730 kg per square meter.</p>
<p>Inside the main entrance, a staircase is set up on both sides of the lobby for spectators to reach the stands directly. Side doors and narrower staircases are set up on both sides of the back of the building for spectators to exit the building.</p>
<p>The three arched doors here, that is, the main entrance of the building, are decorated with Chinese patterns. The rest of the outer walls are built with red bricks, with artificial stone blocks inlaid at the top and bottom.</p>
<p>Entering from the main entrance is the lobby, with ticket offices on both sides. Further in is the hall, with male and female toilets and stairs leading to the stands on both sides. Further in is the passage, leading directly to the sports hall (basketball court) and the gymnasium in the back, and to the office and reception room on the side. Also, through a door on each side (D in the sixth diagram), you can reach the changing, showering, and other rooms for male and female athletes, respectively. From here, you can reach the sports hall, gymnasium, and sports equipment storage room. On both sides of the gymnasium are the kitchen and boiler room, as well as the lobby and staircases for the aforementioned side doors.</p>
<p>The front and rear walls of the building, above the platform, are rounded at the top, with the highest point being 20 meters (66 feet) high. The outer walls on both sides are approximately 12 meters (39 feet 6 inches) high. The roof frames are arranged in front and back rows, each 6.7 meters (22 feet) apart, and are three-hinged steel arched frames (eighth diagram), with a span (i.e., the distance between the hinge points at both ends) of 42.7 meters (140 feet) and a rise (i.e., the vertical distance between the hinge point in the center and the hinge points at both ends) of 19.5 meters (64 feet). The radius of the curve of the upper chord is 30 meters (99 feet), and the height of the side vertical rod, starting from the hinge points at both ends, is approximately 12.5 meters (41 feet).</p>
<p>The lighting in the sports hall and gymnasium is taken from high-angle lighting to avoid dazzling athletes. Therefore, ten fixed row windows are set up in the dome, and sixteen octagonal windows are opened on the outer walls on both sides above the stands. Also, five rectangular windows are set up on the front and rear walls above the platform. The latter two types of windows can be opened to allow air circulation. As for electric lights, they are hung under the iron roof frame.</p>
<p>The heating equipment in the gymnasium adopts a low-pressure system. The water condensed by the hot air is automatically returned to the boiler. The sports hall, the gym, and the ventilation system distribute warm air. The other parts directly utilize the radiation of the heat source to warm.</p>
<p>(C) Swimming Pool</p>
<p>The purpose of this swimming pool (No. 3 in the second diagram) is to provide citizens with water sports and to hold swimming competitions. The pool is open-air and surrounded by stands with a capacity of 4,000 seats. Under the stands are changing rooms, shower rooms, lounges, shops, public toilets, boiler rooms, water filter rooms, etc. A magnificent main entrance is set up on the north side of the stands. Inside the door are offices, reception rooms, lobbies, ticket offices, etc. Corridors and passages are built under the stands along the east, west, and south sides to provide shelter for spectators from rain (ninth diagram). Regarding the dimensions of the swimming pool, according to the regulations of the American University Swimming Competition, the pool surface should be at least 18 meters (60 feet) long and 6 meters (20 feet) wide. The depth of the pool should be at least 0.9 meters (3 feet) at the shallower end and at least 1.5 meters (5 feet) at the deeper end. The dimensions of this pool have been discussed with the local sports community and are planned to be 50 meters long and 20 meters wide. The bottom of the pool is spoon-shaped in the direction of the long side, gradually deepening from about 1.1 meters (3.5 feet) at one end to 1.7 meters (5.5 feet) in the center, and then steeply dropping to a depth of 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) from the center to a point 5 meters (16 feet) from the other end. This depth is stipulated by the Far East Games. )</p>
<p>The pool body is constructed with reinforced concrete and waterproof materials to withstand the (water pressure) when the pool is full and the (earth pressure) when the pool is empty. 725 piles are driven into the bottom of the pool as a foundation. The bottom and edges of the pool are paved with white mosaic, and the four walls are tiled with white porcelain tiles.</p>
<p>The capacity of this pool is approximately 2,200 cubic meters (600,000 gallons). If this huge amount of water is changed frequently, the cost will be prohibitive, and each change will take ten hours, which is also very inconvenient. Therefore, water filtration equipment is installed to turn the turbid water clear again after it leaves the pool and then return it to the pool. The cycle continues endlessly. Each cycle has five stages, namely (1) disinfection, (2) filtration, (3) entry into the pool, (4) circulation, and (5) exit from the pool. This filtration work can continue uninterrupted during the swimming season. After each disinfection and filtration, the water quality becomes cleaner.</p>
<p>The lighting equipment in the pool adopts the latest style, that is, strong light bulbs are built into the pool walls underwater, so that the light and water color are combined into one, forming a complete (light source), which is very pleasing to the eye when viewed at night. On the contrary, if the pool is illuminated from above with lights, the outside of the pool will be very bright due to the reflection of the water surface, but it will only dazzle the swimmers' eyes, and the inside of the water will appear dark, which will make it difficult to rescue people in the event of an accident. Therefore, the method of setting up lights in the pool below the water surface has the two advantages of facilitating swimming and rescue. It is particularly necessary to adopt this method as summer night swimming is becoming a trend. The design of this pool and its auxiliary buildings is based on practicality, but attention has also been paid to aesthetics. The gate walls are made of artificial stone blocks and are carved to show the national female cultural colors (tenth diagram). The rest of the walls are built with red bricks, with artificial stone as the plinth and coping to save costs. Looking at all the buildings in this pool, the architectural styles of all buildings are adapted to each other with the sports field and gymnasium.</p>
<p>Swimming pools in various European and American countries often have small pools attached, with a depth of less than 1.2 meters, specifically for children to swim. This pool has not been able to take care of this equipment due to the limited budget, which is a pity.</p>
<p>(D) Tennis and Baseball Fields</p>
<p>Tennis courts (with three courts and stands with 4,000 seats, etc.) and a baseball field (with stands with 4,000 seats) are planned to be built in the central and northwestern corners of the stadium (four and five in the second diagram). They will be built in the future and are not within the scope of this project.</p>
<p>(IV) Construction</p>
<p>The architectural designs of the sports field, gymnasium, and swimming pool were completed under the direction of Mr. Dong Da, architect of the Municipal Central District City Construction Committee, and assistant architect Mr. Wang Bin. After being submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, the Public Works Bureau invited bids in July of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934). Among the eleven bidders, Chen Tai won the bid with the lowest price. Construction started in August, and the groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 1. It is scheduled to be completed in May of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935).</p>
<p>(V) Additional Remarks</p>
<p>This project has many innovative points in its design, such as the reinforced concrete roof frame, the layout of the entrance and exit traffic routes, the dormitory layout, the equipment of the shops under the stands, and the interior and exterior decoration. These are all sufficient for other places in the country to refer to when designing stadiums. The fact that this stadium, with its large scale, large capacity, and complete layout, can be completed with a budget of around one million yuan, is particularly indicative of the designer's painstaking efforts.</p>

<p>Volleyball is developing rapidly in Shanghai, and the YMCA is particularly strong in promoting it. In 1932 and 1933, men's and women's cup tournaments were held, which were well received by society, schools, and organizations, and they worked hard to participate. Last year's Standard Cup Tournament was a great success. Now that the autumn weather is clear and crisp, it is perfect for volleyball. The YMCA plans to hold the Men's Standard Cup and the Women's Dahua Cup at the same time, and has invited Chen Debing, Li Feiyun, and Chen Yuehe to be committee members. It is scheduled to hold the first committee meeting at 12:30 this afternoon in the Western Restaurant of the YMCA on Sichuan Road to discuss all matters related to the event.</p>
<p>Gan Yuan Actively Promotes Sports</p>
<h3 id="e183">Launches Women's Sports Festival <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) Gan Yuan is the source of the New Life Movement under the earnest instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and also the foundation for the revival of the nation as Chiang called it. In the New Life Movement, sports are an important factor. Because the Chinese people are physically weak and mentally listless, if we do not strive to become strong and carry out widespread and in-depth training of the masses, then the vast number of sick people will have no way to shoulder the heavy responsibility of reviving the nation, and without a healthy body and spirit, everything will become empty talk. Therefore, Jiangxi has paid extra attention to sports since last year, especially for young students. Those above middle school must be militarized, and elementary school students must be turned into boy scouts. How are the results? Due to time constraints, it cannot be achieved overnight. However, the long gowns and gowns of students in the past, those with literary qualities, now all the elementary and middle school students seen on the streets are in ant-like cloth uniforms. The appearance is already much neater. Students account for a very small number of the population. Disregarding social and public sports is not enough to talk about universalization. The Department of Education specially expanded the several tens of acres of wasteland of the Gongyuan into a sports field last year, with running tracks, volleyball courts, tennis courts, basketball courts, and other equipment, which are very complete. Moreover, it is adjacent to Hubin Park, and citizens can often become interested in participating in leisure and recreation after visiting. In the past, all sports events were handled by students, and citizens never cared about them. Since the several citizen cross-country races held last year, citizens have been talking about them with great interest, and they know that they are not just for students to play with. Because women in our country have always not known what sports are, and their physical condition is worse than that of men, the sports field has now launched a women's sports festival. In addition to women's schools and organizations, women in the city can participate freely. Now, the publicity is being expanded and preparations are being stepped up. When it opens on October 14, it should be able to attract a group of women to participate enthusiastically. When those above like something, those below will overdo it. That is, all the troops in Gan have sports facilities for training because Jiang strongly advocates sports. For example, the Fourth Army, which is suppressing the Communists at the front, also held a large-scale sports festival in Yongfeng. The development of sports fields in various counties under its jurisdiction has a grass-on-the-wind trend. However, hygiene and sports are as close as lips and teeth. It is impossible to talk about sports without hygiene. Therefore, cleanliness and hygiene are a universal social movement in the New Life Movement. The Gan Provincial Government has set up a Hygiene Department to be in charge of its affairs in order to save the declining nation. In schools, because past school doctors were like consultants in the warlord era, only eating dry salary, the Hygiene Department specially joined forces with the Department of Education to form an Education and Health Committee, responsible for health guidance, health protection, and prevention and control of infectious diseases in schools in the provincial capital. The improvement of environmental hygiene is carried out in parallel with sports, strengthening the country and reviving the nation.</p>

<p>The 4th Shanghai Chinese Public Race Walking Competition, organized by the Chinese Race Walking Association, is scheduled to be held on November 4th. According to the previous three editions, the number of people joining has been very enthusiastic. It is expected that the number of male and female participants in this edition will not be small.

Women are exempt from paying to show encouragement. Time is from 6 PM to 9 PM. The location is the Association at Moore Church on Tibet Road.

<p>Also, yesterday (September 30th), the Association practiced a 13-mile race walk. More than 40 people joined. However, due to a slight change in the route, several people took the wrong route during practice. It is hoped that each marcher will ask the progress members for help during the next practice in order to provide information. In addition to the Association sending people to take care of the participants by car along the way, Ms. Xu Qi, a female race walking athlete from last year's public race, drove a motor vehicle all the way behind, which was of the same interest and greatly increased the reality. The following is a list of those who completed the entire journey in order: Yang Derun, Wang Jingren, Fan Jiahong, Qin Mingqing, Tang Wenyi, Xu Guoxiong, Ma Zhaolong, Mao Pengfei, Yu Deyu, Li Li, Shi Songhua, Liu Huixiang, Xu Shouqin, Zhang Zhujun, Yuan Caixing, Xue Pansheng, Zhang Wenjun.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education Prepares to Report the Current Situation of National Education to the Fifth Plenary Session</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, by order of the Executive Yuan, is preparing a report on the education section for the Fifth Plenary Session. It has been ordered to each department to prepare separately. (Higher Education) In addition to the facilities and funding of colleges and universities above the national junior college level, the Ministry of Education’s dispatch of students studying abroad, the recent compilation of hospital medical specialty school curricula, and the status of the Geng Fund’s subsidies for education are all discussed. (General Education) In addition to the national public and private primary and secondary schools and the situation of early childhood education, the Ministry of Education's compilation of primary and secondary school curriculum standards, teacher training curriculum standards, vocational school teaching material outlines, etc., as well as the recent education's emphasis on production and vocational education are also concrete reports. (Social Education) In addition to the national provinces' social education undertakings and the progress over the years, the Ministry of Education itself and the general situation of the liaison organization committee and the establishment of experimental areas to promote social education undertakings are all listed in the report. In addition, the situation of Mongolian and Tibetan education and the situation of rescuing out-of-school youths in the Northeast are all reported by the competent departments, so that the Ministry can gather and submit a report to the Fifth Plenary Session at that time.</p>
<p>A Conversation Regarding the Establishment of a National</p>
<h3 id="e191">Academic Advisory Office <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The National Academic Work Advisory Office will be officially established soon. The news has been repeatedly published in this newspaper. The reporter recently went to the Ministry of Education to inquire about the truth. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Education, the office is jointly established by the National Economic Commission and the Ministry of Education. Its plan was approved by the National Economic Commission in April of this year, and its purpose is to build and seek true talents. Because the construction undertakings in various provinces are changing with each passing day, and there is a great need for talents. On the one hand, there is a sigh of difficulty in finding talents, and on the other hand, technical personnel are not using what they have learned due to life reasons. The loss to the country is incalculable. Therefore, this introduction agency is specially organized to achieve the goal of assigning people to their jobs and using their talents to the fullest. Under the current situation, the task of the office can only be carried out in three aspects: investigation, registration and introduction. At present, the introduction is only for technical personnel who are needed for construction undertakings. The nature of the agency is not entirely the same as that of general unemployment relief agencies. However, the Examination Yuan, the Ministry of Education, and other government agencies have paid close attention to the future of graduates from colleges and universities above the junior college level. The reform and expansion of the examination system will be realized soon. The future of those who have received higher education will definitely be more prosperous. The advisory office will also inherit the legacy of using people to the best of their talents and gradually expand the scope of its work to find a way out for the majority of outstanding young people. However, at this time, it can only do partial work. As for the candidate for the director of the advisory office, it is heard that both the Ministry and the Commission have agreed that Cheng Zhenji, Secretary of the Ministry of Education, will also serve as the director, and Yu Tongkui, Secretary of the National Economic Commission, will serve as the deputy director.</p>

<p>The political news from the Ministry of Education recently is recorded below. (1) After the curriculum outline of medical colleges and medical specialty schools was passed by the meeting, the review and organization committees promoted for each item worked separately due to different subjective views, which was quite time-consuming. It is heard that recently, ideas have been concentrated, and most of them have been reviewed and organized. After about a month, the review can be completed. At that time, the Ministry of Education will convene a meeting to decide on the full text. As for the preparation of the equipment standards for medical colleges and medical specialty schools that were previously promoted, it is still being drafted and will be completed soon. (2) Because the National Compilation and Translation Bureau submitted the completed comparative anatomy terminology, the Ministry of Education intends to hire Bing Chenshan and other seventeen people as review committee members. The Ministry of Education approved the letter of appointment on the 29th.</p>

<p>Principals with 24 or More Classes May Reduce Teaching Time</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau specially issued instructions to all municipal primary schools yesterday regarding the revision of Article 9 of the Municipal Primary School Teaching Staff Treatment Rule. The case stipulates that the teaching time of principals of municipal primary schools may be appropriately reduced according to the number of classes, which has been specified in Article 9 of the Municipal Primary School Teaching Staff Treatment Rule and is being implemented. Now, the rule stipulates that there are no separate provisions for the teaching time of principals of primary schools with 24 classes and 30 classes. The more classes there are, the more school affairs there are. In order to avoid affecting teaching efficiency and facilitate school administration, the teaching time of principals of primary schools with 24 classes and 30 classes will be further reduced. Article 9 of the rule is revised and submitted to the municipal government for approval by the Ministry of Education. The revised Article 9 of the Municipal Primary School Teaching Staff Treatment Rule is copied and issued to the bureau for your information. This order is as follows. Article 9 is recorded as follows. The establishment and salary advancement standards for principals of each school are stipulated as follows: (1) A primary school with four classes may set up one teaching director, who is concurrently held by the class teacher and does not receive additional salary, but the teaching time may be appropriately reduced by 150 minutes per week. (2) A primary school with six classes shall change to set up one teaching affairs director and one training director, who are concurrently held by the class teacher and do not receive additional salary, but the teaching time may be appropriately reduced by 240 minutes per week. When there are twelve classes, in addition to reducing the teaching time by 360 minutes per week, they may also advance one level in salary. (3) A primary school with eighteen classes, in addition to setting up one teaching affairs director and one training director as stipulated in the second paragraph, may also set up one affairs director, who is concurrently held by the class teacher. In addition to reducing the teaching time by 360 minutes per week, they may also advance one level in salary. (4) A primary school with twenty-four classes, in addition to handling matters in accordance with the third paragraph, the principals may further reduce the teaching time by 120 minutes per week. Thereafter, for every six classes added, the teaching time may be reduced by analogy by 120 minutes per week, but each principal shall teach at least 500 minutes per week.</p>

<p>Li Shilian exclaimed, "So poor, is there no tax collection agency?" At this time, the shop assistant brought a bowl of braised pork. Jia Duohe first picked up a piece of half-lean and half-fat pork, put it in his mouth, slurped it down, and said with a smile, "Do you know how many days it has been since I ate such a delicious taste? I am very hungry now." Li Shilian said, "Tell me, how is the official business you handled in Yongshou?" Jia Duohe said, "Is there any need to ask? If I really wanted to make some progress, I would have to live in that place for at least ten and a half months, but I couldn't stand it. Two meals a day were cold black pancakes. I thought of many ways to get a plate of chives fried with mung bean sprouts. The best thing is that there was no oil or salt in it, but some vinegar. Not only that, there were many black spots in the dish. I don't know what they were. So, I can give this dish a four-word critique, which is cold, bland, sour, and dirty. On this day, I counted it myself and only ate two and a half bites. That's all, the most embarrassing thing is sleeping at night, not comfortable at all." Li Shilian said, "Since sleeping at night is not comfortable, what else do you have to say?" Jia Duohe said with a smile, "When I say not comfortable, I mean the opposite. Like when I set up a camp bed on the kang to sleep, there is always nothing hanging or blocking me, but those fleas are especially welcoming to me, holding a dance welcoming party all night, making my whole body itchy. Moreover, these things are still the medium of infectious diseases. My heart is constantly panicked, thinking that it is best not to get an infectious disease here. On the third day, I had a burden of ten thousand pounds, but I had to put it down. I didn't want to eat that black food anymore, so I took a car from the west and returned to Xi'an." Li Shilian said with a smile, "Your behavior is wrong. The bank asked you to set up a cooperative to help the rural areas. Of course, you have to set up a cooperative in the most difficult place.

<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Tao Xiaoliu's death has been reported. Another member of the Southern Society of Poets is gone. His name is Mu, style name Bo Sun, and Xiaoliu is his pseudonym. In his early years, he traveled around, especially in Beijing. In recent years, he has appeared as a celebrity and county magistrate, and he has made quite a lot of political achievements. He was very friendly with Hu Pu'an of Jing County, Hu Suliang of Shanyin, and Yu Jianhua of Loudong. They occasionally wrote poems and lyrics, exchanged and sang them for pleasure. He had a liking for beautiful women and loved the pipa. He said that the pipa, with its pillars matched with jin and lu, had more than eighty-four modes, and its value in music was no less than that of the seven-stringed zither. One year, he was traveling in Shanghai. The weather was cold and the year was coming to an end, and he had nothing to do to pass the time. So, he summoned singers to play and sing, hoping to relieve his boredom. However, the people in the singing houses have been using the huqin for every song since recently, so he could not find anyone who could lightly pluck the strings. He was disappointed, and wrote a ci in the tune of "Pipa Immortal" to express his feelings: (Recalling the past, I can listen to the desolate pipa with sad tunes. Who would have thought that after throwing away the green shirt, the singing would suddenly disappear? Stop sitting and washing the tears on the sandalwood. How many times have I wasted my time with romance? As the axis turns and emotions change, the night grows late and the wine is muddy. Sorrow is shared with the cuckoo's cries. I am still in the autumn hall with silver candles, thinking of holding the fragrant, thick clothes tightly. I used to sing softly with green hair, the sorrow of Liangzhou was thorough. I left behind ten thousand years of sighs of prosperity and decline, looking forward to recognizing each other in the eyes of the setting sun. The drums and strings are broken, and I can carefully retell the story before the wine cup.) His poems also have a lot of desolate and mournful tones, probably due to the environment. As Pu'an said: (I drank with you and talked about my life. I didn't cast gold, but I cast emotions. The broken stems drift for a long time and fill the sea of regret. Writing books doesn't leave a poetic name. My heart is like water, cold as ashes. I look at people with white eyes, the candle is too bright. The most is the spring breeze blowing again, the partridge singing in the depths of the elms.) In summary, his life, poems are richer than prose, and lyrics are more than poems. I don't know if his works can be kept from being scattered. It is worth publishing a collection of lyrics to circulate.</p>

<p>The life of a man without a wife always feels too lonely and boring. Almost all work is stagnating. These are the words of a certain gentleman five years ago.</p>

<p>The year before last, I went to Hankou and passed through Jiujiang. When I arrived at the pier, there were hawkers selling porcelain who came to the boat to peddle various kinds of porcelain. Among them was a very large vase, the color was very elegant and bright. The hawker tried his best to persuade me to buy it. I refused him and said: I have no use for such a big vase. He smiled and said: Sir, you can take it back and use it as a decoration in the hall! It turns out that this kind of large vase can only be used as decoration!</p>
<p>Now there are many speculative stores that use many beautiful female employees to attract customers and decorate the storefront. These old guys are not opening up female occupations to adapt to the trend; they are adapting to the psychology of the public today, using cosmetics and flesh to develop their commercial plans. Therefore, the money that female employees sell is 丨丨 of course not all parts. It is not in their academic skills, but in selling their flower-like youth. If you are old, I am afraid your position will disappear like youth 丨 So now some people compare female employees to a vase used for decoration.</p>
<p>A woman with high ambitions certainly does not want to accept such an insult. Isn't a vase in a store a waste in society? Moreover, being a vase is still a trick to sell youth. Isn't it enough to sigh and regret when a woman sells her youth! Women have their own intelligence and talents, why can they only be a vase? This is certainly half for the environment, but half is also because they are too obviously acting as other people's playthings. In general, female employees dress up and are extremely delicate. This is to try to make a (very elegant and bright) vase!</p>
<p>What is even more strange is that women recognize themselves as vases and are not surprised. A few days ago, I went to visit my cousin, Ms. Mou. She said that she was going to drop out of school this semester to work as a female employee in a company or foreign firm. I said that there is no point in being a female employee, it is better to seek more knowledge. Moreover, I am afraid that your current knowledge is not enough to be a capable female employee. She smiled and said: Then it's okay to be a vase. It can be seen that a group of women is still like (Nora) before they walked out, calling them kittens and sparrows, which is sweet as honey!</p>

<p>The Shaoxing boss has an olive-shaped boat with a pointed head and a pointed butt, three oars, and strong arms. Every day, he rows from A port to B port to carry guests. The big river is their home. The Chaohu guest has a shoulder pole, two cattail bags, and all his strength. He goes from the seaside to the town, exchanging heavy burdens for light burdens to go home! Trafficking (smuggled salt), the sea is the only source of life.</p>
<p>Because they have these good characteristics, they can often gain the trust of others. They can gain a foothold no matter where they wander.

<h3 id="e205">Opening Remarks <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenlü</p>
<p>(Opening Remarks), what is called (Opening Remarks)? I think, in our country, there are always some provinces where people do not understand what "Opening Remarks" are. (Opening Remarks), is not some fashionable name like (Cashmere), it is a long-standing, authentic national essence. As the name suggests, (Opening Remarks) is the beginning of a piece, everyone understands that. However, things like the opening remarks of books and newspapers, or prefaces to special collections, cannot be called Opening Remarks, no matter how similar the meaning is. It must be a rhyming piece that begins and ends on its own, sung in the beautiful Wu dialect amidst a cacophony of sounds, and traditionally used by storytellers (so-called ballad singers) before they begin singing a full story, that is called (Opening Remarks).</p>
<p>Now that the meaning is clear, if we want to know the significance of the Opening Remarks, we must first mention the origins of the storyteller, so-called (returning to his parents' home), regardless of whether the statement is wrong.</p>
<p>Storytellers (a respectful term) have ones who tell long stories and ones who tell short stories, which is a distinction. The scripts of those who tell long stories are like historical novels, so they focus on speaking and acting, without borrowing any other assistance. The origins of long stories lie in the Song Dynasty, gradually spreading from the palace to the common people, at that time they were called historical dramas, or commentaries. In the emperor's place, so-called (face to face with the emperor), the courtiers could not avoid putting on a solemn face, naturally tending towards monotony. The scripts of those who tell short stories are ballad novels, fundamentally consisting mostly of rhyming verses, which must be assisted by string and wind instruments, so that the story told emphasizes artistry. This kind of entertainment also began as early as the Song Dynasty, when blind women plucked the pipa and sang stories, circulating in streets and alleys, which was entirely the format of telling short stories. In the poems and private records of the ancients, one can see the above situation. Emerging from the mouths of women, it was naturally charming and pleasant to listen to, and as it was passed down, although there are now many men who tell short stories, it is most appropriate to use the Wu dialect, preserving the original style.</p>
<p>As for when short stories are told, first singing an Opening Remark is to make a contribution to the audience, providing a special interest outside of the main story, mostly to please the emotions, or to provoke feelings. Historical novels, the scripts of long stories, have one or two poems or verses at the beginning of each chapter, which have the same intention as the Opening Remarks in front of ballad novels, both increase interest. It's just that storytellers of long stories do not have musical instruments to assist them, making it inconvenient to recite the poems alone, and it would be difficult to imitate the chanting of verses when monks release the hungry ghosts, and the poems are not as popular as Opening Remarks, so it is simply omitted.</p>
<p>Since Opening Remarks are set up to contribute a special interest, they naturally should not have the same meaning as the main story. As for the materials of the Opening Remarks, whether it be past dynasties, modern times, ideal realms, or utopian lands, all loyal ministers, righteous people, longing wives, laborers, as well as the vastness of the universe allowed by the subject matter of sketches, (excuse me, here comes another sentence,) the minuteness of a fly, when and where can't you find materials to make Opening Remarks? However, to construct an Opening Remark, there are several main conditions: it must grasp the material available for description and tailor it appropriately, it must describe it with extreme depth within a limit that is neither too long nor too short, it must add embellished diction to popular sentences, and it must have a unique sound that is different from poetry, song, and prose. These almost combine the strengths of poetry, song, novels, dramas, and all literary works, so creating Opening Remarks is not an easy task.</p>
<p>Now most short storytellers are not qualified to create their own, and the literati who are well-versed in literature inevitably despise it as a minor art and many disdain to do it, so the Opening Remarks we hear are often that batch of antiques, and many are vulgar and incoherent. Occasionally, there is a piece left by a literati, or specially made by someone for an ambitious storyteller to use, and when sung out, it feels fresh and pleasant to listen to, which is considered a rare treat for the ears. Once a new work is sung out, it is copied and sung competitively, and it is a common occurrence and not considered strange that the words are identified and recited strongly, and errors are transmitted by word of mouth.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Ni Gaofeng has been diligently creating Opening Remarks and will be publishing a special collection, and asked me to say a few words, so I have written this rambling piece.</p>

<p>Furthermore, those two parrots were especially disappointing. Of course, I cannot deny the facts about their plumage and fail to praise its beauty. However, no matter how beautiful the plumage is, they were ultimately annoying. They simply babbled incessantly all day long, except for when we were asleep. I don't know if they were still chattering then, but whenever we were awake, we constantly heard them shouting "Long live the Empress Dowager" and "Peace to the Empress Dowager," always reciting these two monotonous blessings over and over. Eventually, almost everyone's head hurt from hearing it, and we wished we could stuff something in their mouths. However, the Empress Dowager not only didn't find it annoying, but she would always show a smile on her face every time she heard them say a blessing. No one knew what interest she found in it! Thinking about it, I couldn't help but admire Yuan Shikai even more! How good he was at catering to the Empress Dowager's psychology! Simply teaching those two parrots to say two extremely ordinary auspicious words achieved an excellent effect. Afterwards, whenever the Empress Dowager heard the parrots call out, she couldn't help but think of Yuan Shikai. In this way, Yuan Shikai's favor was naturally particularly solid!</p>
<p>Because this was the first time in the Empress Dowager's life that she was traveling by train, there were also four doctors on our train. Their mission, in addition to serving the Empress Dowager, was also to protect the health of our group. But fortunately, no one in our group suffered the slightest illness along the way. Everyone seemed to be deliberately provoking those doctors, never giving them a chance to show off.</p>
<p>Along with us, there was also a eunuch who was promoted to a very important position due to temporary needs. This person had no other strengths, he had just been a farmer by heredity, and he himself loved to study, so he had some extraordinary knowledge of botany, the recognition of various plants and trees.

<h3 id="e207">Research and Criticism on Elephant Shell Tide <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>In recent days, the Dongjiang Fritillary Cooperative and the Shanghai National Pharmaceutical Industry Association have been in a major public dispute for some unknown internal reason. One side says it is to help farmers, the other says it is monopolizing and extorting prices. This is originally a kind of conflict of rights in the medicine trade. It can be said that it is a dispute over interests between wholesale and retail. It can be mediated by figures in commerce and members of the same industry. Research a compromise method, so that both parties can maintain their own rights, and it will be over. Unexpectedly, this trivial issue of price dispute between merchants has triggered a collective action by old doctors to exclude medicines. Speaking of abandoning a kind of medicine and substituting a kind of medicine, what a major issue it is in academics, and what a more major issue it is in people's livelihood. First, a small number of old doctors must never manipulate the whole country. Second, the title of price dispute between merchants must never be taken to argue and judge. Third, the society is a gathering for academic research, and the professional group is obviously different. It is even more unnecessary to join in it like a bankrupt identity and argue about the price of goods with others. I think these are all rash actions that old doctors should carefully consider. To be criticized and ridiculed by discerning people beside them, what a pity and shame it is. Here, based on my personal knowledge, this issue can be divided into several sections for research.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the Issue of Abandoning Medicines This issue should be based on academics. From the past, the basis for old doctors to use medicines was the result of using people as test subjects. Therefore, the inclusion of a medicine into the canon has long sacrificed the bodies of many patients. And now when we want to abandon it, there must be a key point to criticize it, and academic proof, so that it is aboveboard. And now the old doctors, because of the price dispute of the drug dealers, in a trivial matter, advocate abandoning elephant shell, and use Qianhu to replace it. And finally, they themselves also stated (once the price of elephant shell returns to its original state, or farmers can freely sell it, a notice will be issued to resume use), clearly saying that it is entirely for the sake of price that it is abandoned, and it is entirely for the sake of price that it is substituted by other products. This is not at all the tone of a scholar, not at all the attitude of a society, and even less the original purpose of benevolent art (the patient's burden problem will be solved in the next section).</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Issue of National Economy The meaning of national economy, in the past, because residents were opposed to each other, it was said that wealth gathers then people disperse, wealth disperses then people gather, and so on. But now the national economy does not take domestic groups as the object, but takes the international community as the object. Therefore, modern economists take outward development as the main focus. For example, Germany, the United States, etc., often concentrate and combine domestic similar industrial and commercial enterprises, so that domestic competition and exclusion are not allowed, and can consistently develop outward, in order to maintain the national economy and enrich national financial resources. Now the old doctors, having recognized the principle of foreign goods dumping and rural bankruptcy, why do they strongly oppose the cooperative's relief to farmers, why do they want to reject the promotion of domestic goods, and foreign goods (like American ginseng and bird's nest, etc.) are still used, without devising a way to substitute them with other products. Between patients and farmers, who is close and who is distant. The lives of fellow compatriots are not talked about in the national economy. Everyone knows that rejecting domestic goods is promoting foreign goods. Therefore, this kind of rejection is enough to (help foreign goods dump and promote the life of Chinese medicine).</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the Problem of the Burden on Patients It is unfortunate for a person to fall ill. In addition to the pain, the burden of medical expenses is also increased. Therefore, we express sympathy for reducing the burden on patients. However, according to the cooperative, when the selling price is less than 140 yuan per dan, the retail price of the pharmacy is 44 cents per liang. Adding this number up, it is more than 700 yuan per dan. The burden on patients is mostly in the pharmacy. According to Xu Chongdao Pharmacy, personnel must be sent to select, soak, and slice. It must be selected, sliced, and commissions must be paid. These are all losses on the work. Also, stone powder debris and stems must be consumed. Slicing must be consumed, and prices must be reduced on schedule. There must also be scale loss. Both the public and the woman are right. To be fair, there is absolutely no standard for the price of medicines in Chinese pharmacies. It can even be said that if you go to ten, there are ten prices, and if you go to a hundred, there are a hundred prices. It's not too much to say. According to their self-justification to deal with buyers, it is said that the goods have high and low quality. What is used as the standard for his high and low quality is still a big question. Therefore, the patient's burden problem is of course related to the value of the goods purchased by each pharmacy, but the real crux is probably still in the pharmacies themselves, and the conscience of each pharmacy. Just look at the increase in the number of pharmacies and the expansion of their businesses in recent years. The facts are the evidence.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the Issue of Disease Treatment One medicine has one medicine's characteristics, and one medicine has one medicine's function. These are all recognized by us. Therefore, other things can be borrowed casually, but medicines absolutely cannot be confused. But when it is really unavoidable, it is not impossible to use something that is closest in efficacy. Now that elephant shell is neither out of stock, nor has any harm been newly discovered in theory, and the efficacy is not close at all, just for the sake of the drug dealers' price dispute, the old doctors will use Qianhu instead, without weighing the interests of the disease. The heart of Sima Zhao is obvious. Here, the differences in the properties and effects of elephant shell and Qianhu are summarized below for the reference of colleagues.</p>
<p>(A) The old doctors said that elephant shell is not found in the Compendium of Materia Medica. Later generations are accustomed to using it to treat external cold coughs. The adoption area is only in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and a corner of Shandong, etc. I think the medicinal flavors of Shennong's Materia Medica were originally only 360 kinds. Liang Tao Hongjing increased the number to double. By the Tang and Song dynasties, many more were added. In the Jin, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, 39 more were added. Li Shizhen added 374 more. According to the currently popular Compendium of Materia Medica, there are already 1,871 kinds. But there are not a few things that are not included, but are commonly used by old doctors. If we advocate not using it because it is not recorded in the Compendium of Materia Medica, then at that time, Shennong's Materia Medica only had 360 kinds. Why did later generations add so many? It can be seen that the experience medicine outside of what is recorded in ancient books is a sign of progress in medicine. If it is effective, we should add it. And the Compendium of Materia Medica clearly states (Fritillaria from Runzhou, Jingzhou, and Xiangzhou are the best. There are also in various states in Jiangnan). Although it does not specify Xiangshan, Xiangshan should be within the various states in Jiangnan. It cannot be said that it is not recorded. If it is said that it has always been filled with inferior goods from Jiangnan because of greed for cheap, then that is even more of a nonsense.</p>
<p>(B) There are many kinds of products that are popular in our society and called phlegm-relieving drugs. Like Polygala, Trichosanthes, Citrus aurantium, Pinellia, Schisandra, Platycodon, Ophiopogon japonicus, Tussilago farfara, Inula britannica, Gnaphalium affine, Adenophora stricta, Gleichenia japonica, Bamboo sap, Aristolochia debilis, Pumice, Mirabilite, Canavalia gladiata, Inula japonica, Aster tataricus, Stemona japonica, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, and Mori cortex, the main effect of the one kind is said to be resolving phlegm. But in fact, there are not only Fritillaria and Qianhu two kinds. However, considering its content, each has a special function. There are those that absolutely cannot be used instead. Because in the past, the thing called phlegm in our country's medicine had a very large and broad range. Generally speaking, there is phlegm everywhere in the five internal organs and six fu organs inside the body. And the so-called narrow sense of phlegm is any sticky secretion that is excreted from the oral cavity. No matter where it is born or where it comes from, it can be collectively called phlegm. Therefore, secretions from the nasal cavity, throat, etc., secretions from the trachea and esophagus, secretions from the lungs and stomach, are all mixed together and collectively called phlegm syndrome. And the medicines used are also collectively called phlegm-relieving or phlegm-resolving drugs, without any distinction. However, in past experience, the use of medicines has been quite cautious and has varied greatly. For example, Polygala and Platycodon are suitable for colds with phlegm. Pinellia and Glycyrrhiza uralensis are often used for phlegm drinking with phlegm. In fact, most of the phlegm from colds is secretions from the throat and gas. The phlegm from phlegm drinking is entirely secretions from the esophagus, pharynx, and stomach. The parts where they occur are completely different, and the secretions are different in composition. Then the medicines that treat them naturally have their own functions. Just to compare these two examples, the so-called phlegm-relieving and phlegm-resolving drugs of the past, no matter whether they treat hot phlegm, wet phlegm, cold phlegm, or qi phlegm, etc., cannot escape this reason. Therefore, the medicines that were called phlegm-relieving and phlegm-resolving in the past sometimes absolutely cannot be used instead and cannot be flexible.</p>
<p>(C) Can elephant shell and Qianhu be used flexibly? According to our knowledge, it can be said that it is absolutely impossible. Why? Because the functions of these two kinds are, as mentioned above, each has its own treatment target. According to the old doctor's tone, it is that the channels are different. For example, Qianhu is used in Wu Yin Tang, but not Fritillaria. Fritillaria is used in Tan Ke Hua Tan Wan, but not Qianhu. From this point of view, phlegm without coughing should generally not use Fritillaria. In other words, phlegm without coughing is not secretions from the trachea and lungs. Let's check the prescriptions of real famous doctors from the past. It can be said that there is no Fritillaria visible in the prescriptions for phlegm drinking. And there are many prescriptions for cough phlegm that use Fritillaria. Therefore, we can make a conclusion. Fritillaria acts on the respiratory system. Qianhu acts on the digestive system. The two medicines have absolutely no possibility of flexible substitution. The facts are the evidence. In the letter from Chu Huiseng to Mayor Wu, it is said that Qianhu is ineffective in treating cough phlegm. The immediate true evidence. Therefore, the old doctors, because of a small matter of price dispute in the pharmaceutical industry, lightly say that each other can be substituted without adding any research and consideration to this major issue of medicine that affects disease and concerns life. Not only do they lose their own value, but a dignified society makes a joke that misleads patients like this. It is really a great absurdity in the world. Alas. The old doctor's deterioration is evident here.</p>
<p>Some people say that the old doctors' desperate efforts to fully advertise for the pharmaceutical industry, intimidate, and threaten, seem to be somewhat like puppets. In fact, it is all for their own personal interests. Because the backbone figures in several old medical societies are either the owners of pharmacies or the major shareholders of pharmacies. One is two, and two is one. For personal gain, they do not hesitate to sacrifice academics, sacrifice societies, and sacrifice all old doctors, and make this unlucky and smelly trend. But according to Chu Huiseng's experience, he bought elephant shell in Minhang. Minhang is still within the boundary of Shanghai County. The effectiveness of the hive can be imagined. Alas.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Anqing Medical and Health Overview (I) <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>The immaturity of China's health administration and the complexity of the pharmaceutical industry have no strange shape like this in any country. This newspaper's call for articles on the medical and health conditions in various places has indeed grasped the core of a problem: in the future, we must improve China's health administration. And deeply understand the medical conditions in various parts of China. Only from this road can we gain a little harvest.</p>
<p>What is said here is only the local medical and health situation in Anqing. The problem is already very narrow, and the author's ability is limited, so I am sorry that I cannot write everything very precisely. Please offer this as a humble contribution.</p>
<p>(II) A Glimpse of Health Administration</p>
<p>Anqing, although it is the capital of Anhui: however, the territory is barren, and the education level of the citizens is uneven. It can be said that there is no health administration to speak of. Here, let me briefly write about the immature health situation in the local area:</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Republic of China, Anqing's health administration has been under the management of the Anhui Provincial Government. At that time, the Beiyang government did not have a unified plan for health administration. Until the National Revolution</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Government, Anqing has been administered by the Public Security Bureau of the Anhui Provincial Government, which specifically set up a Health Section to handle municipal sanitation. During this period, around the 18th year of the Republic of China, Anqing once established a municipal government, but no health bureau was established, and the Health Section of the Public Security Bureau still handled everything. Considering the past achievements of the Health Section, because the people in charge in the past had not received considerable health administration training, and some had absolutely not received medical and health education, as a result, how to improve the city's health environment, how to count births and deaths, how to carry out epidemic prevention work, how to ban wandering doctors, etc., have not yet begun.</p>
<p>Regarding the registration of doctors in the city, although it began in the 16th and 17th years of the Republic of China, there were many errors. The examination of qualifications, the distinction between Chinese and Western doctor registration certificates, were not emphasized. As of now, the city has registered nearly 200 Chinese and Western doctors. There are also regulations on hospital management and its registration and banning, which are equivalent to a piece of paper, and cannot be discussed.</p>
<p>In the 19th year of the Republic of China, when Chen Diaoyuan was in charge of Anhui, Anqing launched a city-wide health movement conference. All the local leaders dragged long brooms and participated in the parade. Unfortunately, no one has continued to hold it so far, and the citizens may have forgotten it.</p>
<p>Anqing's public education hall, although there is some public health work, such as reprinting small pamphlets on preventing infectious diseases in the summer, posting some health charts on the streets, holding health lectures, and launching infant health competitions, infant vaccination meetings, etc., but the actual gains are still not much.</p>
<p>In recent years, there is an organization of the epidemic prevention meeting in the summer, which is handled by the Anhui Provincial Department of Civil Affairs in conjunction with the major local hospitals, such as free injections of epidemic prevention vaccines, accommodating infectious patients, and setting up isolation rooms in the Tongren Hospital, which is more large-scale. All expenses are about 5,000 yuan per year, but unfortunately, it is limited by financial resources, and it is difficult to have further development. The names of the hospitals affiliated to the (Summer Epidemic Prevention Clinic) in the past years are listed below:</p>
<p>1. Tongren Hospital, 2. Jiansheng Hospital, 3. Boru Hospital, 4. Guangren Hospital, 5. Huimin Hospital.</p>
<p>(III) Business Conditions of New and Old Doctors</p>
<p>Anqing's society is very much enveloped in a half-new and half-old color. In terms of doctors' business, the old doctors are more developed. In recent years, with the frequent disasters of floods and droughts, the old doctors are still active in the society as usual. The reason for this is very simple: mostly because the countryside has already declared bankruptcy, the government has laid off employees and reduced salaries, and the burden of life is increasing day by day. Therefore, the general public with little property and a group of civil servants feel an unexpected deficit in the medical expenses of each family. In order to save money, they mostly invite relatively economical old doctors to solve their illnesses and difficulties. Therefore, the average monthly income of doctors who are quite famous in Anqing is about 600 yuan. The average income of middle-class doctors is about 100 yuan. As for doctors who are not well-known, they are also too pitiful. It is as difficult as ascending to heaven to have an income of 10 yuan per month.</p>
<p>In society, with the advancement of the times, the intellectuals among the citizens are also gradually believing in new medicine more and more. Opening a new medical practice requires some equipment, and organizing a hospital requires hiring doctors, so the expenses are more numerous than those of old doctors. Anqing's largest hospital is Tongren Hospital, which still relies on subsidies from American churches and additional fundraising to maintain it. Because the people in charge of Tongren Hospital are mostly Chinese, they can take charity to heart and do the cause of helping the poor and sick. The average number of patients treated daily is more than 200. In terms of business development and equipment perfection, only this Tongren Hospital meets the conditions of a formal hospital. The remaining private hospitals are only limited to the economy, and it is very difficult to be able to self-sufficiency in hospitals. Therefore, the presidents and doctors of private hospitals also have to seek additional part-time jobs, such as school doctors, official doctors, police doctors, military doctors, etc., to make up for everything.</p>
<p>Anqing is particularly lacking in pediatrics. There are often old women and sorcerers who hang up signs that they are good at treating infantile convulsions, and their business is also quite good. As for wandering doctors, monks and Taoists who write talismans and exorcise demons, new-style street performers, fox fairies, and spiritual Buddhas, etc., there are still many people who particularly believe in them. The author can only deeply sigh and say: I want to say nothing. (The End)</p>

<p>(4) (10) (1) Tapeworm Category (Part 2)</p>
<p>(Q) What does a short tapeworm look like? What do the eggs look like?</p>
<p>(A) The short tapeworm is the shortest of the tapeworms, about one to four centimeters long. The eggs are covered with a thick shell, and six hooks can be seen inside.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the dog tapeworm like?</p>
<p>(A) This tapeworm is parasitic in dogs. If dog feces contaminate vegetables, it can be transmitted to humans, with the liver as an intermediate host, becoming a hydatid cyst.</p>
<p>(Q) What symptoms occur after a human is parasitized by tapeworms?</p>
<p>(A) Most of the time, there are no noticeable symptoms. However, sometimes abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation may occur.</p>
<p>(Q) What other systemic symptoms are there?</p>
<p>(A) There may be loss of appetite, easy hunger, general fatigue, mental anxiety, and complete loss of strength. There may also be headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dilated pupils, irregular pulse, and convulsions.</p>
<p>(Q) When are the patient's symptoms most likely to become apparent?</p>
<p>(A) After eating salty or stimulating foods such as salted fish, green onions, chives, and garlic, symptoms are more likely to appear.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the significant symptoms after being parasitized by broad tapeworms?</p>
<p>(A) The patient exhibits symptoms of pernicious anemia.</p>
<p>(Q) What symptoms occur after dog tapeworms parasitize the human body?</p>
<p>(A) Because the dog tapeworm eggs enter the stomach, the egg membrane dissolves, and the larvae enter the portal vein and then the liver, forming a hydatid cyst. An elastic, fluctuating bulge appears on the surface of the liver, or it may suppurate and become a liver abscess. There may also be ascites, jaundice, and splenomegaly.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the method for diagnosing tapeworms?</p>
<p>(A) It involves demonstrating tapeworm segments or eggs in the stool. Segments of the unarmed tapeworm separate individually, while others remain slightly connected in several pieces. They are also distinguished by the shape of the uterus and the position of the genital pore. Eggs of the armed tapeworm are not easily found in the stool.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the methods for preventing tapeworms?</p>
<p>(A) Prevention method: All fish, beef, pork, etc., must be thoroughly cooked before consumption. All livestock or people who harbor tapeworms must be thoroughly disinfected.</p>
<p>(Q) When should anthelmintics be administered to expel tapeworms?</p>
<p>(A) Anthelmintics should only be administered after tapeworm segments have been demonstrated in the stool.</p>
<p>(Q) Why is that?</p>
<p>(A) Because anthelmintics often carry a considerable degree of risk, they should not be used in patients with suspected symptoms. In particular, they are not suitable for the weak, those with pulmonary tuberculosis, the elderly, pregnant women, or weak children.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the common types of anthelmintics used to expel tapeworms?</p>
<p>(A) Commonly used are male fern extract (maximum dose 100.0), male fern oil (10.0), pomegranate root bark (maximum dose 50.0), kosso flowers, kamala flowers, etc. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e210">A Brief Introduction to Pulmonary Tuberculosis (2) (10) (3) <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Regarding the measurement of temperature, it is usually divided into three areas: oral cavity, armpit, and rectum. The most accurate of these is, of course, the rectum. Although it is slightly higher than the other two, it is generally very average. Normally, the highest body temperature each day is 37.8 degrees Celsius in the rectum, 37.2 degrees Celsius in the oral cavity, and 37.0 degrees Celsius in the armpit. Measurements in the oral cavity are often inaccurate due to prolonged contact with the teeth. If there is inflammation of the teeth or oral cavity, there will be local heat, which will, of course, lead to misdiagnosis. Measurement in the armpit is the least suitable for this disease because patients with pulmonary tuberculosis tend to sweat easily under the armpit. This evaporation of sweat just lowers the temperature, so the result is unreliable. Measurement time: 5 minutes for the rectum, 10 minutes for the oral cavity (at least 5 minutes), and 15 minutes for the armpit. Short periods of half a minute or a minute can easily lead to errors.</p>
<p>The important situations of increased temperature have been described in detail above, but there are also a few exceptions that are commonly seen. Normally, conditions such as hyperthyroidism, sinus suppuration, chronic appendicitis, chronic abdominal organ inflammation, and inflammation of the tonsils or teeth all have higher temperatures than usual, similar to pulmonary tuberculosis. To deal with this situation, in addition to relying on long-term reports of temperature fluctuations and precise measurement, there are also some practical characteristics of pulmonary tuberculosis itself. Although this is too trivial, everyone can test it, so I think it is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>First: The temperature of this disease is very easy to fluctuate. Normally, the patient's temperature is generally normal when getting up in the morning, but it will immediately rise by five or six tenths of a degree after just a small thing like rinsing the mouth first. In addition, reading and writing will also cause the same situation. Second: The temperature will, of course, change after an activity. This situation can also occur in ordinary healthy people. Needless to say, strenuous exercise will cause it, but even a normal one-hour walk can cause it to rise. However, the measurement report is below 38 degrees Celsius, which is immediately distinguishable from the disease's exceeding 38 degrees Celsius. In addition, in healthy people, the temperature can return to normal after just half an hour of rest, but tuberculosis patients need more than double that time. Third: The temperature is higher in the morning, reaching 37 degrees Celsius or higher, but this does not occur at night. This situation, which is completely opposite to the usual, is coincidentally seen in many cases at the beginning of the disease.</p>
<p>Based on the various pathological anatomy conditions, the temperature of tuberculosis patients also changes accordingly. Usually, chronic fibrotic processes often have no fever. Exudative types mostly show high fever or remittent fever. Consumption fever is particularly prominent when cavities occur. The temperature increase in ordinary glandular tuberculosis is generally not very severe.</p>
<p>Several important symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis have now been described one by one. Finally, there is another situation that is very common, namely: The psychology of tuberculosis patients is very irritable and easily stimulated. They are easily angered by any action of others, and as a result, they almost become egoists. This is more common in women. Some patients are overly pessimistic, even in mild cases with hope for recovery. There are also those who are very optimistic and have a very strong desire for recovery. These excessive situations cannot, of course, be effective with drug treatment alone. Even very proper treatment sometimes has diminished effects. Regarding sexual desire, most patients are hyperactive. In young male and female patients, there is even a very strong inner desire to marry. This should certainly not be attempted lightly. Even if we disregard the risk of infection to the new family, pregnancy and childbirth in women are enough to make the disease deteriorate. I hope that both patients and non-patients will pay attention to this social problem. (End of this chapter)</p>

<p>(10) (7) Trachoma</p>
<p>Regarding the history of trachoma and its impact on the country, I have already discussed it in the previous issue. We often acknowledge that it is an infectious disease, and also a contact infectious disease. This infectious bacterium has not been definitively proven even with the development of medicine today. Various research groups have been organized in Europe, America, and Japan in the East. The government has also prepared bonuses, waiting for inventors to receive them. So the proof of this bacterium may not be far away. What we already know now is that this bacterium must exist in the eye secretions (i.e., tears, etc.) of patients suffering from trachoma. It can be directly or indirectly spread to others through the medium of fingers, towels, face water, and other utensils. When there is a lot of secretion, the risk of infection is also higher. In addition, crowded living (such as prisons, schools, orphanages, barracks, factories, entertainment venues) and places with public towels (such as teahouses, restaurants, bathhouses) offer even more opportunities for transmission.</p>
<p>Speaking of the symptoms of trachoma, they vary depending on the severity of the disease. In the mildest cases of trachoma, patients are often unaware that they have trachoma and do not feel any pain. Sometimes, the presence of trachoma is often discovered by a doctor during a physical examination. Or, people suspect trachoma when they notice tearing, photophobia, pain, eye discharge, sticky eyelids, burning sensation in the eyes, redness in the eyes, foreign body sensation in the eyes, and blurred vision. At this time, if you evert the eyelid, you can see that the conjunctiva of the eyelid (the inner surface of the eyelid) is red, congested, and turbid, with small, oval, yellowish-gray granules scattered around. Sometimes each granule is raised, protruding above the conjunctival surface. The number of granules varies. It depends on the severity of the disease. These granules, to a certain extent, can heal and contract on their own, or be destroyed and produce scars. Or their contents soften, and the conjunctiva where the granules grow undergoes fatty degeneration or hyaline degeneration. The appearance is similar to glass or colloid, and there is a kind of luster. Clinically, there are several different names for observing trachoma. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e212">Common Treatment Methods for Fever (1) <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>This article discusses the treatment methods for any kind of febrile disease. The English word for fever is Fever. The word "fever" is not a specific term for any disease, but rather a condition of a disease. Many kinds of diseases cause fever. According to the principles of treatment, one should treat the disease according to its symptoms. In other words, treat the cause of the fever. If the cause is removed, the fever will naturally stop. This principle should be paid special attention to. However, fever is also extremely related to the body and must be paid special attention to. For example, a temperature above 105 degrees can easily endanger life. When Chinese people have a fever, they only know to ask a doctor to prescribe some antipyretic medicine to seek temporary relief. This mentality does not conform to the principles of modern medicine. Here, someone may ask why do people get a fever when they are sick? Now, let me use a metaphor to answer this question. We have all seen boxing matches and wrestling. Do two wrestlers generate heat and sweat when wrestling? Of course, they generate heat and sweat. Then, there is also a reason for the body to generate heat when it is sick. A febrile disease is when bacteria invade the body and the body's antibodies and white blood cells, cells, etc. engage in war. The more intense the war, the higher the fever. As a result of the war, if the bacteria win, the patient will die. If the body's resistance wins, that is, eliminates the bacteria, the disease will be completely cured. Therefore, the therapist should do their best to assist the body's resistance in this war, just as we should assist and aid our own troops to eliminate the enemies that invade us. The war in the human body must have a winner and a loser; unlike human wars, which can sometimes be mediated and resolved peacefully.</p>
<p>Someone else may ask, is fever ultimately beneficial to the body or the disease? Answer: Fever is beneficial to the body if it is not too high. For example, when a country encounters an enemy invasion, it will rise up to resist the enemy and do its best to drive the enemy out of the country, so that it can naturally preserve its own safety and tranquility. This is like a person having a fever. Conversely, if a country is invaded by an enemy and does not rise up to resist enthusiastically, then the enemy army will be unstoppable, and the country will be destroyed. The same is true for patients. If poisonous bacteria invade the body and the body cannot resist, the poisonous bacteria will be rampant, and the sick body will be beyond salvation. Therefore, in recent years, medical scientists have confirmed through research and experience that there is no need to be particularly afraid of ordinary fever. However, because fever greatly increases the metabolic functions in the body, we must provide the body with materials to resist. The human body is like a machine. For example, a car must use more gasoline, oil, water, etc. when it is driving fast. When a person has a fever of 105 degrees, it is like a car driving at 200 miles per hour. A person's fever is like an oil lamp. If there is oil in the lamp, the wick will not burn out, but if there is no oil, the wick will burn out. Therefore, when a person has a fever, provide him with adequate materials and place him in a suitable environment, so that the fever will not cause him special harm. Here is an example: When I was studying medicine in the United States, I had a classmate who had typhoid fever. He had a fever for a month and a half. Because he had adequate treatment, when he recovered from the illness and left the hospital, I looked at him and was very surprised. What happened? That is, he had a fever and diarrhea for more than a month, and when he was discharged from the hospital, his body was actually several pounds heavier than before he was sick. This is just an example of medicine defeating disease.</p>
<p>When a person has a fever of one degree (Fahrenheit), the body's metabolic rate increases by 30%. If the temperature increases by six degrees (such as from 98.6 degrees to 105 degrees), the body's metabolic rate (consumption of nutrients) will increase by one and a half times. Therefore, he must obtain this one and a half times the nutrients from food so that he can avoid damaging his internal organs.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Method of Measuring Temperature and Explanation <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>There are two types of thermometers. One is the Fahrenheit scale. The body temperature of a healthy person is 98.6 degrees. The other is the Celsius scale. The body temperature of a healthy person is 37 degrees. These temperatures are taken under the tongue. The thermometer should be placed under the tongue for three to five minutes. For children or people with mental confusion, the thermometer should be placed in the anus for three minutes. The body temperature in the anus is one degree higher than under the tongue (Fahrenheit). Sometimes, the temperature can also be taken in the armpit. This place is one degree lower than under the tongue.</p>
<p>The body temperature of a healthy person is 98.6. It is lower by about one degree in the morning. A temperature of 99 degrees or higher is considered a fever. Mild fevers are approximately 100 to 102 degrees. Severe fevers range from 103 to 105 degrees. At 105 degrees or above, patients often become delirious. Above 105 degrees, there is always a risk of death. People with particularly strong bodies can sometimes reach 107 degrees, but at this temperature, it is more likely to be bad than good.

<h3 id="e214">Thinking for Criticism <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Baige</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Criticism is an opinion on something. A person cannot have no opinion on things, and this leads to criticism.</p>
<p>Moreover, criticism exists at all times and in all places.</p>
<p>In general, most people like to express their own opinions. If they are able to use pen and ink, then they will use pen and ink to express them in a certain form, so that they can be passed on for a longer time. Naturally, criticism exists here.</p>
<p>Some people, although they do not like to express their own opinions, often only let them dissipate silently in their hearts. Perhaps criticism is even more difficult to take on a certain form of expression from them, but they must have an attitude of either accepting or rejecting things, and this attitude implies at least criticism. As a result, it still cannot be said that criticism does not exist.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can definitely say this: Regardless of whether others acknowledge or deny it, criticism ultimately exists at all times and in all places.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>However, some of our writers, as soon as they see something that seems like criticism, get angry and say: What kind of bird criticism is coming again! In their minds, the reason why criticism is bad is that it prevents writers from creating freely, and the reason why they cannot create great works is because they are constrained by criticism. Therefore, some people even invented a special "template" for critics, saying that this template is what critics often use to judge whether a work is "okay" or "not okay," as if as soon as this template is gone, they can freely create ten great works.</p>
<p>What is the result? The template is gone, and perhaps great works will be produced. However, another kind of thing that seems like criticism is coming again. For example, many people are asking, "Why are there no great works produced in China at present?" The premise, of course, is that there are no great works in China at present. Isn't this a big criticism? It can be seen that criticism still exists, but this kind of criticism is no longer from critics but from non-critics.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>At present, we cannot deny the existence of this kind of criticism from non-critics. Moreover, we should also say that this kind of criticism from non-critics is prevalent: we can often see a kind of reading-impression-style book and newspaper criticism in all newspapers and magazines. If I meet a young man who likes to read B newspapers, then they will definitely talk about how so-and-so's work is. Also, various symposiums or tea parties and even criticism meetings are being held. This is a very obvious situation.</p>
<p>However, this situation may not last long. Because on the one hand, some people are already saying that reading-impression-style criticism is not criticism and do not like that non-critics also have criticism, and on the other hand, some people are scolding the shallowness and recklessness of the current Chinese criticism circles and placing themselves as exceptions as critics. This means that, it seems that the shallow and reckless Chinese criticism circles at present have suddenly exceptionally produced several very "okay" critics who make some very "okay" criticisms that pass without hindrance, but in fact, they are removing the original criticism made by non-critics as well. Because we do not believe that the currently shallow and reckless criticism circles can exceptionally produce several very "okay" critics who make some very "okay" criticisms that pass without hindrance.</p>
<p>Why is it necessary to remove these criticisms from non-critics as well? It can be said that each has different intentions: those who scold the shallowness and recklessness of the current Chinese criticism circles and place themselves as exceptions as critics may be doing so because they want to obtain a temporary monopoly and have not considered that they will be removed along with the criticism in the future; but some people who say that reading-impression-style criticism is not criticism and do not like that non-critics also have criticism have the suspicion of setting up a trap to make criticism re-enter the fate of a few years ago. A few years ago, were there also many so-called non-reading-impression-style criticisms from critics? I think these people may have such a move in the future: They will bestow the title of "critic" on anyone who has a bit of criticism. In this way, as critics are negated by the general public, naturally even that bit of criticism will also be negated by the general public.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Everything is inseparable from criticism. And the progress and development of everything depends entirely on the criticism within itself. Even if people do not have the courage for self-criticism, they should always have the courage to accept external criticism. Why do some of our writers get angry as soon as they see criticism?</p>
<p>Naturally, the incompetence of critics is a fact, but we cannot but hope that very competent critics will appear. Critics are not very competent all of a sudden. Perhaps we cannot find a bit of not-incompetent criticism among some incompetent critics, but we cannot but hope that very competent criticism will appear. Then, where do the so-called very competent critics and criticisms come from? First of all, we must understand that critics and readers cannot be separated: First, critics are also readers; Second, readers are the biggest critics. As long as we understand this point, then our writers will shake hands with criticism.</p>
<p>I think writers should shake hands with criticism properly. Even if the critics' criticism is incompetent, they must temporarily cherish the opinions of the general readers, and this is the reason why they must shake hands with criticism.</p>
<p>All very competent critics and criticisms can be asked from readers.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Shantou, My Hometown <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Feier</p>
<p>Shantou, oh, my hometown,</p>
<p>Is a port without winter. The second city of Guangdong. A face of gray-black, a bottom of sin, and suffering from urban deformity.</p>
<p>I detest this dark city, but I also cherish this scenic hometown in the southern country.</p>
<p>Was it eight years ago, I was spat out of this port on a morning of turmoil and terror in an old country: And eight years later, I was sucked into this port again in a golden dusk reflected by the evening glow. Like all cities' digestion and discharge of people and goods, I was spat out and sucked in, sucked in and spat out. In a turbulent generation, a tiny person is also like a piece of wood rolled in a vortex, following the turbulence.</p>
<p>Although I had stayed for some time in this port of my hometown, my impression of this port is vague. I cannot know it as clearly as I know Singapore, nor can I understand it as well as I understand Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yet I hate this city: because it sips the blood and sweat of the farmers, and from the blood vessels of this city it transports it to the Red Hairs. Warehouses in front of customs are piled up, the laborers' voices never stop, the ships spew black smoke, and the farmers sigh in hunger in the fields.</p>
<p>When the world is hit by depression, mourning spreads all over the countryside, and farmers are forced to take risks. So the rich gather in Shantou, and overseas Chinese return home with capital. Land prices have risen, and entertainment venues and luxury goods have suddenly increased sharply. While the city is working hard to clear and expel the endless streams of vagrants and beggars, at the same time, the nights of Shantou are filled with the sounds of singing and gambling. Shantou's belly is empty, but Shantou's charming face cannot but be coated with powder: Shantou's legs are already suffering from softening paralysis, but the tottering torso that is propped on top of the soft legs is still full of pride. A shameful face, oh, this is my hometown!</p>
<p>Yet Shantou was originally not worthy of being despised like this. Look at the white waves roaring outside Mayu, but Mayu Port eternally welcomes wanderers returning from abroad with her thin mouth and cherry lips smiling. The black stones on Shi Hill are rugged, and the mountain peaks are showing a bright red smile of spring. Countless fishermen on the sea cast black nets of harvest; the paddy fields on the land are golden yellow, and in the twelfth month of the lunar year, the vast fields are still hanging with golden-red tangerines in abundance. In the golden dusk, the fields are filled with hardworking sons of the earth; in the quiet mornings, Shantou also rings with the sound of the hammers of the workers building the earth. Shantou is showing the dawn in the darkness.</p>
<p>Shantou, oh, my hometown!</p>
<h3 id="e217">Lonely Flower <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Yingzi</p>
<p>People are lonely, and flowers are also lonely.</p>
<p>Recently, my home has been so deserted that I don't even feel like thinking about flowers. A'yun thought I was too lonely and that providing some flowers to regulate the dryness of life was necessary. Appreciating his kindness, he specially sent me a bouquet of white carnations, lonely flowers.</p>
<p>(Lonely flowers, white carnations, a melancholic, pale girl!)</p>
<p>I really lack interest. Lonely flowers, let them bloom and wither lonely. Isn't my own youthful life spent just as lonely? Our world is inherently lonely! Isn't it?</p>
<p>I washed out a bottle to keep them in and placed it in front of the window in the bedroom, considering the matter finished. If there is a clear night with a good moon, and a quiet light shines in, bathing in the dim glow, the white carnations will secretly smile in the clear moonlight. Immersed in this淡永atmosphere, gazing at the starry night sky, a lonely blessing will faintly leak from my lips:</p>
<p>(Lord, have mercy on this group of lonely souls. Although they have neither joy nor suffering, do they only have to endure in this way? ······)</p>
<p>People also smiled as miserably as the flowers, with tears in their eyes.</p>
<p>The following days were all like this. Waking up with a sleepy taste, the room was filled with a wisp of clear, everlasting fragrance. Facing the morning breeze, the bouquet of carnations had already bloomed exuberantly. What a graceful summer posture, ah, summer!</p>
<p>Leaning against the window, let me praise this serene morning.</p>
<p>The church bells fluttered in the morning mist. The white carnations drooped their heads. The touch of the sun caressed them; it was like a painting of a virgin in a medieval monastery kneeling before God to receive baptism.</p>
<p>(Lonely flowers, white carnations, a melancholic, pale girl···········Ah!)</p>
<p>People age easily, and flowers fade easily. Even though they are just a bouquet of lonely blooming flowers, they cannot be allowed to possess much glory.</p>
<p>The flowers have fallen. ····</p>
<p>The pure white carnations withered and fell to the ground. The breeze flowed in from the window, blowing the fading branches and leaves, rustling with a lonely sound, a lonely flower that bloomed and withered lonely:</p>
<p>(The season of summer has passed.)</p>
<p>Sobbing, I quietly picked up the fallen petals and wrapped them in purple silk, hiding them in my pocket. I want to warm these lonely remnants with my lonely heart; there will still be a summer next year.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Small Talk Between Characters <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Lengmo</p>
<p>1.  Let's Talk About the Space Between Characters</p>
<p>September 23rd is the old Mid-Autumn Festival 丨丨丨 The new Mid-Autumn Festival is September 15th. That method is not very clever. Not to mention there is no moon, it is not Mid-Autumn Festival at all. According to the new calendar, September, October, and November, three months are autumn. Mid-Autumn should be on October 15th. The real Mid-Autumn Festival should be the Autumn Equinox. That doesn't agree with either the old or the new method, but the old method sometimes coincides. For example, this year, inaccurately speaking, it is only short by thirteen and a half hours 丨丨丨 September 24th is the Autumn Equinox. The bustling world suddenly becomes concerned with the universe, which seems to be a good opportunity to talk about the universe.</p>
<p>We can take this opportunity to thank our ancient civilization. The Chinese term for the universe is much better than the Western word "Universae." Although it has been translated as the universe, its original meaning only refers to within the celestial sphere. Our universe, according to ancient sayings, is宇, which refers to the top, bottom, and four directions, and宙, which refers to the past and present. Not only is the explanation of space ingenious and lively, but it also adds time. Based on the precedent that the invention of guns and cannons should be attributed to China, the invention of four-dimensional space should also be considered China's glorious contribution 丨丨丨 Of course, regardless, few of us now understand relativity.</p>
<p>Actually, talking about 宙 gives me a headache. To put it simply, the distance of one light-year is one with thirteen circles of kilometers added. A 100-inch telescope can see distant space 10 million light-years away. The light from the nebula there is already 10 million years old when we see it. How to get there, we don't know. According to the theory of the expansion of the universe, assuming it moves outward at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per second, then how many eras will it take to move another 10 million light-years away 丨丨丨 The calculation is not difficult, but I don't have the courage to say how many kilometers one light-year is 丨丨丨 In short, in such a distant future, it is very likely that mankind will have long been extinct, the earth will have been completely destroyed, and the sun will be dying.</p>
<p>Although astronomers proudly peek into defining the universe from finite to infinite, we only feel fear about it. All we can appreciate is the quiet celestial sphere as imagined by the ancients, and a few bright celestial bodies within the celestial sphere that move regularly in the short term. We don't care about their past and present; we only care about their top, bottom, and four directions. In other words, we easily understand 宇 but find it difficult to understand 宙. 宇 is clearly presented before our eyes. We know that we are a part of 宇, while 宙 requires a lot of thought and often does not yield a result.</p>
<p>Therefore, I dare not talk about the universe and will only talk about the space between characters.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Mr. Township Chief (10) (5) <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>(Then, I can only use the name of the old master to solicit donations from the village, and then I will go to Shanghai and Nanjing to run around and see; those fellow villagers will always contribute some. If the amount is not enough, then I, Dasheng, will cover it myself.)</p>
<p>In this way, the Chang'an Bridge, which had been broken by the flood, was repaired. Mr. Dasheng also took over the Yusheng shop from Mr. Feng Wen.</p>
<p>The business of Mr. Dasheng's Yusheng shop was quite good last year. Now, it is said to be a little quieter.</p>
<p>(The situation this year is really urgent. The price of rice is too low. Accounts can't be collected. From morning till night, there is not even half a cent of business. It's really boring to death.) Mr. Dasheng has been saying this a lot lately. And then, he added: "Rural bankruptcy, recession, economic panic, world war," new terms that the villagers didn't understand.</p>
<p>But the villagers didn't believe his words. Every market day, people from the upper and lower mountain villages had to go to Yusheng shop once and buy something, no matter how small.</p>
<p>(Don't say that. You always go to the tide temple when there's a tide. When others make a copper coin of business, you always have ten copper coins to make!)</p>
<p>(One family doesn't know another family's affairs; you're really chewing on maggots. Moreover 丨丨丨 again 丨丨丨) Mr. Dasheng said, plopping down on the account table. Shaking his head as if he had a whole string of things to say.</p>
<p>Today, while Mr. Dasheng was talking about these principles, Township Chief Mr. Feng Wen suddenly ran over again.</p>
<p>(What should I do? The higher-ups are urging me, and I can't hand over the people! This assignment is unbearable.) Mr. Feng Wen sat in front of the account table, distraught.</p>
<p>(What kind of assignment is this?) But Mr. Dasheng could immediately switch to the question raised by Mr. Feng Wen. Mr. Dasheng shook his leg and said calmly, (Tell Dongsheng to go door to door and ask; those who are willing to go, go; those who are not willing to go, pay money.)</p>
