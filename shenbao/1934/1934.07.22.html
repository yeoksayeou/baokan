<p>據中央社訊。二十三年度國家總槪算。業經中政會核定。計收支總額各爲七億七千七百萬元。我們比較該總槪算的重要收支項目。便可以看出國民經濟衰落的影子。已經在國家財政方面。完全反映出來。</p>
<p>第一·是中央經常歲出的緊宿。在這一次的總槪算案外。國防機關及其他行政機關。有沒有另案辦理的特别歲出預算。我們暫且不去管他。單就總槪算案内經常軍事支出一項而言。似乎已比上年度减少了一萬萬元以上。這顯然是由於債務經費支出的抬高。行政經費的相當恢復常態。及其他支出數字的增加。同時。國家經常歲入的短絀。當然也要算是這次總槪算案在數字上採取緊縮原則的一個很重要的原因。第二·是彌補收支方法的轉變。我國中央財政收支。從來不曾有過實際上的平稀和適合。過去五六年間。當局爲着國庫窮絀的原因，不免對於金融市塲有「予取予救」的事實。結果。至於·形成濫發公債的現象。積至今日。公債的本息支出與年俱增。到了年約二五八·○○○·○○○元之巨。公債濫發的影響。直接當然是增加金融市塲的負荷。間接阻碍產業的發展。在國民經濟的現階段上。財政收支不敷的彌補方法。已經到了必須轉變的時期。在這次總槪算案中。局已經開始了增稅政策的動向。便可證明上說之不謬。至於増稅方法是否能完全解决目前中骨收支不敷的限度。則又當别爲推敲了。</p>
<p>增稅政策。果然足以解决目前的財政困難嗎。卽令稅欵收入的增加能如以</p>
<p>所估計。那末。其影響又將如何呢。這都是在簡單說明增稅政策内容之後可以回答的問題。在這一次總槪算案中。計鹽稅增加四千四百萬元。統稅增加二千萬元。關稅亦有相當的增辑。計共約增稅至七千萬元以上。以受影響的商品而論。則鹽是生活上所必需的。所以增稅不過增加生活困難的程度。統稅的担負者。雖說以捲烟業爲最重要。可是棉紗火柴水泥·麥粉·諸業所提負的。亦共當統稅總額三分之一左右。至於關稅稅率的變動。更能處處影響商品的成本和價格。照這樣說來。這次增稅的對象。完全以商品爲主主因此。商品的推銷狀態。便是决定增稅效力的基點了。我國目前的對外貿易。處於日形收縮的地步。加以本國重要產業。亦都有朝不保夕之虞。農村破產之後。倘更加以大旱災。則國民對於商品的消費。是否可望增加。實在是個絶大的疑問這是我們對於增稅方法不能樂觀的地方我們認爲在國民經濟瀕於破產之時。加稅的結果。無論就生產成本或國民生計而言。都未能减輕購政上之危機。所以在這次總槪算案中。我們尙看不出有什麽解决財政困難的方法來。</p>

<p>｜｜答許樂眞，杜洛基君｜｜</p>
<p>有許多讀者讀了李達譯的唯物論敎程一書，發生種種疑問，現在我們所收到的關於這書的問題，已有三四百條之多，這些疑問，有的很淺顯，我們都個别答覆了，但也有不少的很重要的問題，從今天以後將繼續的公開答覆，這些問題中有的是因爲譯筆晦澀，讀者難於理解，有的是因爲排字錯誤，有的則是因譯者沒有弄淸楚原意而翻譯錯了，最後這一點是我們特别要注意的，因爲中國的翻譯大抵是不可靠的多，不經過一番檢查，對於讀者實在不便，而檢查工作，也是我們所要做的最重要的事情之一。</p>
<h3 id="c237">許築眞君問： <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>一，「觀念論哲學最喜歡和唯物論鬥爭，顯現得牠已經離宗敎而獨立」從道兩句的上文看來，這裏的末一句似乎應爲「顯現得牠已經和宗敎併合。」</p>
<p>答「觀念論哲學最喜歡和唯物論鬥爭······」一語，是被譯書的人譯錯了。原文應該譯作觀念論哲學爲着要能够更有效的對唯物論實行鬥爭，有時就假裝出似乎離宗敎而獨立的樣子」。</p>
<p>二，「但即在基於一前的誇大了的科學的命題之時，哲學也不能不取媚於宗敎。」這兩句不憤其意義。</p>
<p>答，「但即在基於一面的誇大了的科學的命題之時，哲學也不能不取媚於宗敎」一語，意思是說觀念論的哲學者。有時爲要假裝自已是獨立於宗敎之外，而不得不將科學上的命題利用來做自已的證拋，然而他們所利用的科學命題，並不是完全的，因爲要適合他們的需要，所以只將命題的一方面片面地誇大了；而在這種時候，他們仍然是在向着宗敎取媚，並沒有眞的獨立。</p>
<h3 id="c238">杜洛基君問： <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>一，「馬克思在一八正四年到七六年的戰爭時代······」一八正四年想必是錯了，請指正。</p>
<p>答，一八正四年是刋誤，應改爲一八五四年。</p>
<p>二，「質的移動，即各發展階段，具有先行階段的發展法則所不能說明的特性」究全不明意義。</p>
<p>答，事物的發展，必經過許多階段，每一階段均有每一階段的特性。例如一個人，從生到死必須經過糼年，靑年，中年等階段，每到一個新的階段，這人的性格就與以前的階段不同，靑年人的性格必與糼年人的不同，靑年人的性格中比較糼年人更增加了許多新的東西，所以靑年這一階段的特性，决不是它的先行階段（即糼年）的特性（或發展法則）所能說明，性格的變動即是質的移動。</p>
<p>三，批判的思維着的人類的意志」何義？答，意即「以批判的態度去思索人類的意志」，人民派不知道社會的發展有社會自已的物質法則，而以爲社會的前途是能够受人類的意志左右的，不過這種意志不是盲目的，而是經過審愼的思索考慮才能决定的。這經過審愼的思索的意志，即是「批判的思惟着的意志」。自然，人民派以爲思想意志可以左右社會歷史，這是一種唯心史觀，是錯誤的。</p>
<p>四，在「某一方面被誇大就變爲物神是和偶像」這一項目下的四行中的「牠」字所指爲何？最好這四行能詳爲一解。</p>
<p>答，第七行的兩個牠字，却是指各方面的「某一方面」。</p>
<p>第九行的「牠」字是指正某一方面以外的「其他方面」。</p>
<p>一切事物都是多方面的，例如一個人，普通總有肉體思想，性格等種種方面，就人的一生來說，糼年，靑年，壯年，老年等，就是一個人在發展中的多方面之表現，事物旣是多方面的，則每一方面在該事物中只佔有部分的重要性，决不能代表該事物的全體，糼年矢折的人，是不能算做完全的人的。事物的每一方面旣然不能成爲全體，則我們如果的各方面中的一方面誇大了，把這一方面看得過分重要而忽視了其他的方面，使其他的方面都掩蔽在牠的下面，受牠的支配，把牠看做自足自立的東西，把牠看做偶像，牠在客觀上的意識本來沒有這樣重要的，而我們偏要把牠看得這樣東要，那麽，我們的意義對於牠就得不到正確的反映，而是歪曲錯誤的反映。觀念論就是將思想的一方面誇大。的結果，所以觀念論是不正確的。</p>

<p>講到正手拍擊的各種主要方式、現在讓我們來輪替地加以研究、並且將各種方式、加以分析、看究竟那一種是盡美盡善、通常看起來、最有效的和最有價値的、要算是從上方使球向前旋轉的從球頂扭擊式、因爲此種方式在拍擊時、球拍是向上略微斜擊出去丙、球拍的擺動、是向上的、並且拍弦向着球面刷去、於是球就旋轉地向前飛去、此種方式的利益、就是球向前飛時、是向前旋轉着的、所以有降落的趨勢、不致向前直飛、較之直射式的拍擊球、落地要快得多、因此重重的拍擊時、球也不致飛出界外、</p>
<p>至於要研究向前旋轉的球、爲何能够自動落地的、實在理由和力學上的原理、以後專論旋轉拍擊法及牠的效能時、再詳細討論、現在祇要明白、使用此種方式、球落地時要快得多、並且還有一種最大的益處、就是球員很重拍去的時候、球總是落在界線以内、不致於飛越過去、</p>
<p>因爲要產生上述的效能、球員在起首拍擊的時候、球拍向前的擺動、要比較預定拍擊的地方略微低些、在將球拍出時、球拍向前的擺動、就要略微向上、有的球藝精良的人、他們使用此種方式、是先將球拍向着來球平擺出去、當拍弦和球面兩將接觸的時候、就馬上將球拍向上一擺、並且用力將球一扭、於是球受着拍弦的刷擊、就向前旋轉地飛去、</p>
<p>以上兩種方法、不管是採用那一種、都應當儘量地使球面和拍弦多有接觸的時間、接觸的時間愈長、球員對於他的拍擊管束愈有把握、若是球拍迎着來的頂上擊去、球必定難飛過網去、這是很明顯的、所以拍擊時、拍面要略斜去迎着來球的頂上、還要順着向上一擺、此時球拍的形勢、當然是底邊向後而頂邊向前的、</p>
<p>應用此種方式、最要緊的地方、就是球已拍出以後、球拍的擺動、要儘量地使盡順勢力、萬不可過於着力去將球扭轉而停頓擺動、因爲要球向前旋轉地飛去、又要牠的飛程縮短、就必得將球拍一直擺過左肩去、又要牠的飛程縮短、就必得將球還得要將拍頭順勢擺過頭頸、所以在球已離拍弦以後、手腕要馬上放鬆、於是在上臂由胸前擺過的時候、拍頭就必經過左肩、而球拍的動力、也就會自動地停止、並不須要手腕力去阻住、</p>
<p>講到此種方式的利益、除開以上所說的｜｜球身向前旋轉、落地時要比較來得快些、並且可以用力拍擊、球還是不致於飛過界線｜｜以外、還有更大的利益、因爲球身向前旋轉、落地迅速於是牠的反躍力就必更强更遠、對手在此種情形之下、就不得不遠向後方退去迎擊牠、再者、此種方式、使球在空中飛行時、比較由下方削擊式要快得多、並且球身向前旋轉迅速、對手要臨空迎擊、就難得有效、</p>
<p>此時對手臨空迎擊來球有兩點不利、一是球身向前旋轉着、飛過網的時候、就馬上向下降落、若是此式使用得法、球飛到對手身邊、必已經是很低、他要臨空迎擊、就必得要慢慢地將球舉高過網、此時球身的旋轉力和他的球拍接觸時、就會向上略微斜射出去、二是、遇到精於臨空擊的對手的時候、在他手中球雖不致向上斜射、但是拍擊的手法必要遲緩、並且球的飛程必定略微高起、於是容易應付、這也是很明顯的益處、</p>
<p>不過實用此種方式、也有一種極大的危險、就是球員每每有過於着力使球旋轉的趨勢、因而忘記了拍擊時向前推進力量的不足够、以致球不得很快地和根深地飛入對方、此種拍式不可用撞擊、練習時直到拍弦和球的接觸能够時間較久、並且當接觸時、是用掃擊來產生旋轉的動作、拍擊後、球即迅速的離開球拍、這是很明顯的、但是拍擊時若多用掃擊而少用撞擊的動作、則球和拍的接觸自然可以延長、對於此種方式、英國的球員技術較精、並且他們迎擊來球時、球拍是平掃出去、在球面正和拍弦接觸還沒有離去的時候、手腕就趁勢一轉、因而產生球向前旋轉的力量、</p>

<h3 id="c276">關於婚姻自由 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 斐</p>
<p>自從海禁洞開，歐風東漸，婚姻自由聲浪，已經動搖了我們的「父母之命」「媒妁之言」｜「嫁雞隨雞」「嫁狗隨狗」式的婚姻法則，隨着「辛亥」革命，就有些維新男女揭起反叛旗幟｜實行婚姻自主，到了「五四」時，關於婚姻自由以至戀愛自由可以說是在理論上討論的無可再事討論，已經成了定論，：就是婚姻應該自由，戀愛應該自由！那知又從「五卅」高潮湧起所謂「國民革命」之後，已經七八年了，還呌我們天天在報紙上看到些靑年們迫於專制婚姻自殺的新聞，尤其是關於女子的！這是怎麽說？我們眞不禁有「人們何世之感呀！</p>
<p>可是查一查現行的法律，在民法第四編第二章「婚姻」項裹，却明明有着這麽樣的條文：</p>
<p>第一節　婚約</p>
<p>第九百七十二條　婚約應由男女當事人自行訂定</p>
<p>第九百七十三條　男未滿十七歲女未滿十五歲者不得訂定婚約</p>
<p>第七百七十四條　未成年之男女訂定婚約應得法定代理人之同意</p>
<p>第九百七十五條　婚約不得請求强迫履行</p>
<p>這是在十九年十二月二十六日由國民政府公佈二十年五月五日施行的！似乎不是不兌現的支票，然而宣騰報紙的不惟有杭州行素女校學生史濟華投井自殺；福建惠安九女聨盟投水而死；就是在首都南京，同在六月裹，也有一位李蓮琳因反對代訂婚姻誓死不願出嫁，受她的頑固父親逼迫不過，吃下安眠藥水死掉了！（見南京六月三日的大華晚報）何以死了這許多靑年女子，都「視而不見聽而不聞」的呢？現行的刑法第一編第二十五章「妨害自由罪」又明明有這樣條文：</p>
<p>第三百一十八條　以强暴脅迫使人行無義務之事或妨害人行使權利者處三年以下有期徒刑拘役或三百元以下罰金</p>
<p>本條未遂罪罰之</p>
<p>第三百一十九條　以加害生命身體自由名譽財產之事恐嚇他人致生危害於安全者處三年以下有期徒刑拘役或三百元以下罰金</p>
<p>請問：專制代訂的婚姻，以至威逼强迫履行，，這種情形算不算是觸犯了刑法上的「妨害自由罪」｜尤其是上面所舉出的兩條？凡屬國民，在國家法律的跟前是人人平等的！論理依法，不管誰是父母誰是子女的！然而最令人不懂的：杭州福建爲反對專制婚姻自殺的女子，還可以說是她們父母無顯著威逼的情形，而南京李蓮琳之死，是她父親的威逼事極顯，何以也不見檢察官們「偵查」和「公訴」呢？是不是年輕女子國家法律例不保障，爲之父母者可以任意生殺予奪的呢？關於這個眞相，我們希望能得到「立法」和「司法」的機關給一個公開的詳盡的解釋！同時也盼望素以保障人權保障法益自居的律師們能就「律文」「法理」「判例」給我們一些高明正確的意見！</p>
<p>此外，關於這個問題｜婚姻自由之取得勝利，雖則現在封建的幽靈還是到處活躍，然而找以爲並非什麽很大的難事：譬如，在「辛亥」革命之前，父母等尊親，可以自行處死子女，爲法律所不禁止，後來，法律改訂，殺害子女春（不論其是否忤逆或辱門敗户）同一是犯殺人罪，二十多年來，這種事可說是不大有｜，婚姻自主，在民法裹旣明白規定應由當事人自行訂定，又規定不得請求强迫履行！而且在刑法裹，還有「妨害自由罪」的條文可以依着伸訴請求救濟！法律這樣東西，究非不兌現的支票，大家一齊宣傳開去，援用起來，效力是着實不小的！時代究竟是前進的，假使人人都知道「現行法」的眞相，誰肯甘心去做那種旣害了子女又犯　國法的蠢事呢？說到這裹我希望此後的學校敎育，應授予學生以法律常識，使一般靑年女了，知道援用法律，不致枉死於非命。</p>
<h3 id="c277">女性與電影 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 草令</p>
<p>據戲院的收票者的一般觀察，說是看電影的觀客中，有百分之五十是女性。據電影公司的負責者的談話，說是每天總有幾封女性寫來的信，要求做演員。從這，雙方的觀點上，我們很可以證實女性與電影是有着交互的聨系。</p>
<p>的確，電影事業在中國，是一種新的有望的企事·在中國文化上是一負有力的新力軍。它有着重大的使命：它的前途之命運的盛衰，是對中國今後的文化有着極大的進出的！一方，女性能鼓着勇氣來參加這個新的文化運動，——當然也是謀婦女解放，接濟獨立的婦女職業的一條新的道路。—或者來擁護這個運動，自是極好的現象。</p>
<p>但是現實便是理論的證明，現實是會吿訴一切醜劣的現象給大家看的，現在從事於這電影事業的女性，是怎樣的呢？現在擁護着這新的文化運動的女性（現象）是怎樣的態度呢？</p>
<p>很明顯地，新的電影事業，是給少數的女性從業員的個人的不規行動，（這是說，不是眞正地了解電影而從事着電影所找得的錯誤行動）蒙上了不少的污點。——當然此地我决不會說整個的電影事業的醜劣都是從這一點上出發的，不過，我想誰也不會否定，一個整個的事業中，某一小部分的不上正軌，便不會牽制或影響到全般的。電影事業的現狀惡劣，自有它比這個更重大的原因存在着，但這女從業員的不知電影所負的文化上的使命，以及不自愛好的行動，而所找到了自身的不名譽，必然地也會影響到整個的電影運動之進展。一方，極有意義的好的影片之不受女性的歡迎，也很明顯地表示了女性並不是眞正了解了「電影藝術」並不是眞正他　在擁護着「電影藝術」。</p>
<p>當然，過去的已屬是過去的了。中國電影藝術的將來，是有着極大的希望，同時中國電影藝術，是切要着能了解它的女性來勇幹地參加，拓荒，和擁護！</p>
<p>我們决不否定，參加從事電影事業，是一種婦女底帶有文化使命的新職業。同時，我們也决不遲疑，以爲了解及擁護電影文化的時機還未到。</p>
<p>爲了好的現象，能早日實現計，我們得提出下面的幾個具體的意見。</p>
<p>一·我們希望各高中以上學校（男女同學的）有關於電影的理論科目，使一般多了解一點「電影藝術」。</p>
<p>二·我們希望在某一個學校中有電影的專門科。尤其是女子的。因爲現在的一般現象，電影女從業員的智識水準較男從業員爲低。</p>
<p>這是預防式的提議。</p>
<p>一·站在婦女解放自身的立塲上應舉發現在電影女從業員的劣點。</p>
<p>二·應排除那些誘惑電影女從業員到墮落之途上去的一切惡環境，勢力</p>
<p>三·婦女的刋物上，應有淺近的關於電影的理論或介紹。</p>

<p>— 高爾基萬契美譯</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>看不如知，知的基礎爲勞動經騐，而非「推想」，或許，男性所看見的較女性爲多，不過他的知識，只限於打獵者怎樣殺死禽獸的狹隘技能而已。</p>
<p>女性定居，其知議積蓄的過程，因保護性命，健康，增加食料，改良勞動條件等的關係，而逐漸發展。最堪注意的，宗敎史家差不多絲毫未曾說及女性在形成宗敎儀式的過程中起了何種作用。</p>
<p>大槪，創造宋敎思想的，是看守爐灶的老頭兒，他們雖已失去了勞動能力，但却有殺死野獸的豐富經騐，和公司行動的凖則的知識，因之這種老頭兒也就是打獵部落的權威言。</p>
<p>這裹順便要指出的，水與火激發想像能力的作用，宗敎研究者總是估計得不充分。火是一種威嚴而却可愛的力量，牠有一種生氣勃勃的威力和不故克服的燒毀慾，牠有着眩目的美麗和敏捷的行動，牠有一種使獸肉加增美味的愉快技藝，牠可使樹木變爲烟灰，燒碎石頭，有時且化石頭爲流體，牠可以消滅水·使水沸騰而變爲氣體，總之，火這個各種各樣的奇異的力量，無疑地且有力地曾影響有原人想像的發展。水，大槪也有同樣的作用，人們到處看見有水：他的身體上也有水；濕樹燃燒時也蒸騰着水；在水流中人可以看見自已的影子，水雖然是流着，但却不冲去他的影兒；水一遇火，不是水消滅了火，便是水被火消滅，化氣而上升；有時空中發現了流星和電光。凡此種種，人們都是看見了的，但是上面業已說過，看與知却有很大的差别，一個宗敎思想家，什末沙，羅維夫其人者，他對於看的能力下了一因定義，說，看的發生，彷彿是跟人的理智無關的，不是隸屬於現實世界的現象的，他另創造了一個神界。</p>
<p>把這種能力，加諸於原始人類，那是說，把原人跟斯維登堡及其他幻像者放在一起了。原始人君是個人神同形論者，在其開始自覺的對待自然現象的時候，他在自然界中尋出了與自已相似之處。那時，人爲了自然鬥爭，不需要玄學，形而上學，原人不尊　自然爲神，而祇是「按自已形像」「自然界視爲靈魂」。所以，原人爲自已用魔術手段足以與自然鬥爭了。那時妖術，巫魔，還不是形而上學的玄學的。</p>
<p>資產階級的文化史家所關心的，不是揭穿事實的本意，他們只是爲預先所做的結論而選擇材料，他們在史前的過去，所找出的不是考古學及人種誌吿訴我們的，文化奠基人——古代勞動人，而是這種人的「同伴」——神，沒有神，原人似乎是不能生活的。</p>
<p>玄學的需要，不是爲的與自然界鬥爭，而是爲的反對人。造神主義的發生，並非出於古化宗敎史家的高興的動機，而是出於僧侶謀辯護自已統治人們的志趨。不消說，要追究由人們勞動和生活鬥爭的過程所激發而來的現實思想之發展，是十分困難的。</p>
<p>原始文化的研究，開始於十八世紀，而研究資料在數千年來，因各種部落和種族的觀念錯綜混合的關係，遭受了無數的變遷。</p>
<p>假定，人們根據的實踐，原始已經有了一種可以克服自然的「先覺」，而且自以爲是英雄，偉人，甚重神了，但這仍不是說形而上學，超現實的東西，因爲「奥立普」神完全是眞實的「貴族」，而「愛迪」神則只是典型的挪威農民。一般邪敎的神，大都是理想中的典型各種手土匠。（後删）（本節完，全篇未完）</p>
<h3 id="c279">讀碧梧君的「論姦殺」後 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— 皓于</p>
<p>今天翻開報紙，讀了碧梧君的「論姦殺」一一文，不覺感慨系之。姦殺確是一種犯罪行爲，在法律上，道德上都是不可原諒的。</p>
<p>殺人這個舉動，無論它的動機是仇殺，情殺，姦殺，皆爲法律所不許的，祇要你殺死一個人，或者殺人未遂，都是罪有應得的，姦殺並未受任何法律的保障或辯護。所以我們明白姦殺這件事用最嚴厲的法律也難禁絶的，正和其他的殺人案一樣。</p>
<p>碧梧君說：「在禮敎防閑之下，女人竟肯冒死和别的男人通一點欵曲，她的結婚生活，無用說也知是不爲圓滿；而且那不圓滿的原因之中，常常是因爲丈夫有外遇，這樣的情形，誰該死呢？」我以爲人人也不該死。因爲這種私通行爲，大家都是不對，妻與别的男人私通，那男人也是别人的丈夫；同時自已的丈夫與别的女人私通，也正和自已私通别的男子一樣，所以我以爲男人的殺妻，或女人鴆夫，都是同樣的不應該。夫婦之間旣不能互通欵曲，甚而至於不能共夜的時候，那還成什麽夫婦？倒不如爽爽快快地各我各的人——能够互通欵曲的人之爲快了。</p>
<p>不過，在現社會裹，一般人的頭腦，禮敎之束縛未除，封建之遺毒未消，對於離婚的人——尢其是女子，未免要帶幾分瞧不起的眼光。所以有許多名義上夫妻，——其實就是怨偶，不敢輕易提出離婚；還有一層，凡是提出離婚的夫妻，男人一方面，總要負一筆不能爲力的赡養費，所以寗願夫妻之間仇　相視，而不願離婚的，結果呢，便是鬧到尋死，鬧到和别人發生關係種種不幸的事。何苦來？夫婦旣不能雙方感覺到一些興趣，就該離開，寗願到將來任何一方覺悟到自已不對的時候，再重歸於好，比較虚僞的夫妻，大家受着精神的苦痛，來得爽快。而且勉强支持下去，眞的可以把已破裂的感情愈弄愈僵，以至不可收拾的。</p>
<p>雖然話是這樣說，社會可以任從我們如此自由行動嗎？現在有許多自由離婚的人，遭幾多人的評論和歧視。難怪這許多怨偶，寗忍受精神痛苦支持下去，，一面各自另尋愛人；難道這樣行爲就不受社會批評唾駡？然而我們要知道：社會是人羣所組織的，離婚，私通，是人羣所爲；批評，唾駡，也是人羣所爲。同是人羣的事，何必自已駡自已？假使我們以爲自由結婚是合法的，自由離婚又何嘗不合法？批評什麽？唾駡什麽？社會的事，都是人羣的行爲，假使現社會容許人們自由結離，就不必唾駡他人的離異；倘若有人要唾駡，那些人就不是現社會的人，是前世紀的人，是僵屍而已，我們現社會的人怕它作甚？</p>

<p>— 蕪</p>
<p>預知姙娠的方法，已有二三種問世，不過都是非常麻煩，而且不甚確實，最近日本熊本醫科大學福島博士新發明了一種很簡單的預知法，這種方法頗合科學的原理，而且經該博士實騐的結果，實際又非常確實，現在介紹於下，</p>
<p>診斷法</p>
<p>可把姙婦的尿放在玻璃管裹面，加上溴液（Ｂｒｏｍｉｕｅ　Ｗａｔｅｒ）數滴，十分鐘之後，加上强阿莫尼亞水和炭酸錏水的混合液數滴，稍加振盪，姙婦的尿，含有多量的Ｈｉｓｔｉｄｉｎ這一種物性，所以尿便會呈桃紅色，如說不是姙娠，那就不會變色，這不過利用Ｈｉｓｔｉｄｉｎ的加水分解作用，所以手續非常簡便，</p>
<p>證實</p>
<p>福島氏就以此法在該校附屬病院的婦人實騐的結果，請求預診姙的五十個婦人裹面，呈陽性的四十六人（卽變色的），四人呈陰性，結果非常準確，再就普通的健康女子（不姙婦）數十人試騐，則多呈陰性（卽不變色），由此可見這種方法，很可以供實用了。</p>
<h3 id="c281">「秋風秋雨愁殺人」 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 方士人</p>
<p>在雨影渺茫，熱潮高漲，各方土地已呈了龜裂現象的今年的夏天，讀到紀念秋瑾女士的刋物，不覺得了一陣凉爽和快慰。回想一千九百零七年舊曆的六月初六的淸晨，一個獻身於種族革命的英雄，秋瑾女俠，在被捕後，將被殺於紹興的軒亭口之前，對着比猛獸還兇惡的瘟官，所寫的唯一的供詞，只是「秋雨秋風悉殺人」那麽緊峭的一句，我們的心頭，能不湧上一陣悲凉的而又壯烈的冷流？</p>
<p>雖然出身於浙江紹興的一個官僚的家庭，雖然後來又做了湘潭一個豪紳的媳婦，然而秋瑾始終是在特定的時代特定的社會裹一個最前進的新女性的典型。她是衝破了愁殺人的秋雨秋風的舊氛圍而出現的一輪炎炎的夏日！看她脫去身上的華服環佩，跑到日本去留學，馬上就加入了同盟會：回國後住在上海虹口的厚德里，和同志製造炸藥，藥性爆裂，自已被炸傷之外，又險些被警察捉到牢裹去。其後又在嚴重的壓迫下，秘密地組織反滿的光復軍。終於被人吿密被捕，然而雖受盡了各種我們所想像得到的刑罰，而這位堅實崛强的女戰士，唯一的口供還只有「秋雨秋風悉殺人」！她雖是屬於前一時代的女性，可是她那種勇邁直前之氣，郤使數十年後的當代墮落的摩登小姐，都變成無恥的妖精了！</p>
<p>歌詠「黃河源溯浙江潮，衛我中華漢族豪，莫使滿胡留片甲，軒轅神胃是天驕。」的秋瑾，由「旦辭黃河去，暮宿黑水頭，不聞爺娘喚女聲，但聞燕山胡騎聲啾啾」的花木蘭看來，一定是偉大到　不可思議，的確，由狹小的家庭骨肉的孝思，而出發代父從軍的花木蘭，發展到爲民衆，爲漢族，而組織所謂光復軍的秋瑾，這中間，新女性的進程，已不可道里計了。</p>
<p>自然啦！主張「光復漢族，大振國權」的秋瑾，由現在民族解放運動中的新戰士看來，是多麽偏狹得可笑！但這是時代拘束她的。時代所課給牠的任務，她已盡了最大的最善的努力了。如果在中華民族解放運動的現階段，還有人高唱着「光復漢族，大振國權」這一類的舊調子，或是準備民族對民族的屠殺，那才使躺在西子湖邊的孤墳裹的秋瑾的幽魂，永遠不能安眠呢！</p>
<p>秋雨秋風老是這麽愁人的，然而像秋瑾那樣搖旗呐喊，要想掃蕩這惡氛的新女性，在那兒呢？</p>
<h3 id="c282">婦女應有的性交常識（續） <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 良</p>
<p>（二）性交時的位置一般靑年男子，在性交時往往要求對方取一種或數種異常的位置（坐位或立位等），致令有些婦女雖已結婚數年或經分娩數次，而也會發生膣部受損傷的疾病。尤其是雙方的生殖器官不匀衡者，更易使膣後穹部發生裂損，而惹起與隆上面所述的同樣的病症。這也是必須注意的。</p>
<p>（三）月經間忌性交婦女在月經期間，性慾最爲亢進（特别是在將終了之時）：然而在月經期間，是絶對不可性交的。因爲月經是子宫粘膜破壤出血的表現，與子宫發生創傷一樣。倘在月經期間性交，那就不異予細菌以侵入子宫的機會，而使子宫發生内膜炎，周圍炎等病症。况且性交時的物理性的刺激，更會引起血崩的危險。而同時男子方面，也易誘發尿道炎，假性淋等疾病。</p>
<p>（四）妊娠期性交的限制有些醫學家是主張妊娠期中絶對地停止性交，這或許是偏激之論。不過，妊娠中性交是必須有限制的。在妊娠初半期，是不妨行適度的性交，——所謂適度，最重要的是避免過甚性的興舊，過猛烈的用力，以及腹部的重壓，藉防子宫出血，成爲流產。至於妊娠的後半期，尤其是最後兩個月，那是必須禁絶性交的了；否則，會發生子宮出因，羊膜之早期的破裂，早產，和分娩後的發熱等險症。</p>
<p>（五）性交後的淸潔中國婦女患白帶的很多，其原因，可說大半是由於生殖器的缺乏淸潔；因其不潔，致患子宫病。所以保持生殖器的淸潔，是減少婦人病的惟一良方，尤其是在性交之後必須經過充分的洗滌。而洗滌最好於事後半小時行之。其法：用陰部洗滌器盛着微溫溫的藥液，插入腔内洗滌，其藥液，如一百分之一的石炭酸（Ｃａｂｏｒｌｉｃ　ａｃｉｄ）百分之二的來沙而（Ｌｙｓｏｌ），或煮沸殺菌的食鹽水等皆可用。（完）</p>

<p>讀書固然是好的事情，讀自已所喜歡的書，那便更好。但是，小朋友！你們應該注意到：你們的趣味是不是好的？那就是說；你們喜歡的書，是不是好的？</p>
<p>把許多人的趣味集合起來，就知道趣味的等級，是相差很遠的。有許多人的趣味，對於個人，社會，國家，都是有益的。但是有許多趣味，却是有害的。小朋友正是儲蓄知識的時候，對於趣味的選擇，是應該怎樣的謹愼？</p>
<p>怎樣選擇趣味？這是一個極大的問題。</p>
<p>在這裹祗能簡略地吿訴諸位：諸位應該先考慮，自已的趣味是不是能夠增加知識，增加思考的能力，或是對於學校裹的某種課程，是不是有益的？這樣你對於你的趣味，已經加以選擇了。至於得到了和自已趣味相近的書籍以後，小朋友應該問問父兄和師長，這種書是不是應該閱讀的？</p>

<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>不管春天，秋天，冬天是誰的，總之，這夏天是我們兒童的季節。這話又從何說起呢？小朋友：且稍安毌躁，聽我慢慢的道來。</p>
<p>因爲暑假的期間最長，差不多有兩個月的光景，那末在那長長的假期裹，我們便可以任所欲爲了。在都市的可以逛公園乘風凉，有機會也可以跟了父兄們進游泳池去學習游泳，家境好的當然還有冰結漣吃。住在鄉村的更不用說了，捉了螢火蟲安放在蛋殻裹，好玩；捉蜻蜓捉往了，好玩；捉魚捉蝦，好玩；牽了牛洗個冷浴，好玩；而且不用穿衣服，卽使穿也只穿條短褲，披塊小汗巾，眞是爽快極了！</p>
<p>無論你怎樣說，無論你作着各種不同的比較，夏天總歸是我們兒童的季節；假如不相信，那你只要看，在夏天，大人們不都是昏昏糊糊的嗎？兒童們不都是活活潑潑的嗎？</p>
<p>但是在夏天我們雖然愉快，却也要防樂極生悲，第一，不潔的東西不能吃，以免疾病的傳染。第二，也應該跟父兄們學些工商或農作物方面的智識，不要把寳貴的光陰白　白地度過下。</p>

<p>— 章南邨</p>
<p>海兒看見螢光一閃一閃的，很覺奇異，問母親道：營能發光在動物中，是絶無僅有的，那閃爍的狀况，好像空中放電一般，想是它會放電麽？</p>
<p>母親說：並不是電，螢的尾端，有發光器，呼吸時空氣傳入，生養化作用，所以一明一暗的閃動，若是有電，人捉了螢蟲，不就觸電嗎？夏天它在水草上產卵，水邊營蟲，比較别處聚集得多，因此有「腐草化爲螢」的成語，古人好學，夜間無燈，囊螢照讀，傳爲美談，從前隋煬帝，由運河遊幸揚州時候，命沿途人民遍地捕獲無數螢蟲，獻給於他，夜間於兩岸放着，千萬成羣的飛在樹上，好像「火樹銀花」一般煞是好看，這種頑意，眞虧他想得出，但是隋煬帝荒淫無度，不久就「身弑國亡」了。</p>
<p>海兒又問：光能生熱，養化作用，是要烯燒的，何以牠不致燃燒起來，被火燒死呢？</p>
<p>母親說：螢尾端有液體包含在内，液體的水分，輕氣化合，不助燃燒，因此不發生燃燒危險，這就是它的生理作用</p>
<p>海兒又問：螢不是放電，但是還有什麽益處沒有？</p>
<p>母親說：螢和糼蟲，都食種種害蟲，於農事有益，切勿遇着就用扇子去撲它，讓它自由的飛來飛去，替農家作撲滅害蟲的工作，也就是我們「愛物」的美德。</p>
<h3 id="c290">夏天的遊戲 <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 丁合</p>
<p>夏天，因爲太陽照在身上很熱，所以許多小朋友，都躱在屋了裹，不去遊戲。但是躱在屋子裹坐着，豈不是太寂寞嗎。</p>
<p>是的，爲了諸位小朋友太寂寞，因此吿訴你們幾種夏天玩的遊戲，而且都是有趣得很。諸你依着下面的方法去玩玩，是不是很有趣的。</p>
<p>飛飛泡　玩這個遊戲，最好兩個地點，一，在電風扇下。一，在太陽光裹，因爲在這兩個地方，更可以增厚你玩的興趣。</p>
<p>先在沒有遊戲前，預備一隻碗，或一隻瓶，和一根麥管，或一根竹筆套。在碗内放半碗水，水裹放些肥皂屑，用筷調化，調到肥皂屑不見了，就可以開始玩這遊戲。</p>
<p>玩的方法是用麥管一頭，含在嘴裹，一頭伸進碗去。伸進碗的一頭，只要一着水就拿出，拿出之後，在含在你嘴裹的一頭上，輕輕的吹着，麥管的那頭，就有一個很小的水泡出現，慢慢的變成大的，於的從麥管頭上落下來，在空中飄着，飄着，有風的時候，還能够飛上飛下。</p>
<p>假如這個遊戲，你在電風扇下玩，就能够飛來飛去，飛上飛下。你在太陽光裹玩，就變成五色鮮明的泡泡。</p>
<p>找娃娃　先要告訴你的，做這個遊戲，只要兩個人，分誰是甲，誰是乙。</p>
<p>現在甲先給乙找吧：甲右手的中指代表娃娃，甲左手握緊右手指，只露岀指光在外，但是要使得乙看不出那隻是娃娃，那隻不是，就給乙找。</p>
<p>乙在五個指頭中，找娃娃，找到了就用手指揑牢娃娃，呌甲放開左手，看是不是已找到或沒有。找到的是甲敗乙勝，甲放開手給乙打手心。乙一面打，一面唱下面的歌：</p>
<p>「找娃娃，尋娃娃，娃娃給你丢在大河裹。撈，撈不起；爬，爬不起；娃娃哭着說，要我打你手心三十六：一，二，三，四，五··················六十六。」</p>
<p>假使乙没有找到，找錯的，就換乙做給甲找，依此做下去。</p>
<p>P&gt;兒童科學講座可怕的蚊蠅</p>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>夏天到了，天氣炎熱，可怕的蚊蠅也到處發生了。小朋友們，你們都覺得它們可怕嗎？是的，它們是害蟲。但大家可知道它們的害處在那裹？用什麽方法可以驅除它們呢？我現在約略的吿訴你們吧？</p>
<p>蚊子的孵產在污水裹，受着太陽的溫熱而孵化成「孑不。」（圖一）等到脫去外皮，身體變曲的時候，就成蛹，（圖二）再等到生出足和翅膀，蛹就裂開背面中央的線，飛出成蚊。（圖三）雄蚊吃草汁，雌蚊吸人血，我們十分討厭它，而且它們吸了病人的血以後，把疾病傳到我們身上來，另外有一種瘧蚊，它棲息的時候，尾部總是向上的。（圖四）它是傳播瘧疾（寒熱病）的媒介，更是可惡。</p>
<p>蠅卵產生在腐敗的食物中，隔一畫夜卽成蛆，就是糼蟲。（圖五）十天以後，脫去外皮，裹面皺缩，成橢圓形，便成蛹。（圖六）再隔三數一，生出翅膀和脚，破殻飛出，卽成蠅。（圖七）它的習性，喜歡骯髒。它有三對脚，每隻脚上長着無數的細毛，每隻脚上的細毛中，至少可以容納一百萬個微生蟲，所以蒼蠅聚集過的食物，我們吃了一定會肚痛，或泄瀉，因爲他把病菌都從脚上帶在我們的食物上了。</p>
<p>蚊蠅都是我們的敵人，它們會使我們生病，甚至於死，所以我們應該設法撲滅它們。撲滅的方法，淸潔是根本，如排除污水污物，淸潔用具等，倘若已經發現了蚊蠅，可以點蚊香，用捕蠅紙，蠅拍，捕蠅瓶等撲滅（圖八）捕蠅紙用松香，桐油，蜂蜜，煎熬後塗在厚麻紙上卽成。蠅拍的製法，也很簡單，預備好鉛紗，竹片，鉛絲，就可以如（圖九）製作了。</p>

<h3 id="c292">暑假期中怎樣消遣？伯眞 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 伯眞</p>
<p>太陽的黑點漸漸的縮小，熱度也一天比一天增高，總在寒暑表上百度左右徘徊着。</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們在家裹煩悶嗎？要出去遊玩時，而你們的父母，不允許你們出去，恐怕暴日曬壤了你們的身體，可見父母愛子之心是多麽的深刻呀！</p>
<p>在家裹讀書寫字，二三小時已足，多讀多寫了，腦中便要發昏。餘下來的光陰，待怎樣的消遣呢？</p>
<p>現在是一個科學昌明的時代，應當適合潮流的做些有科學意味的玩具來玩玩。我可以介紹你們：</p>
<p>（一）潛望鏡：</p>
<p>材料：木板，玻璃，鋸子，英尺，鉛筆。</p>
<p>做法：先把木板鋸成長約八吋闊約二吋的立方體，離兩端二吋各開一個方孔，同時把兩塊玻璃塗上墨，恰恰裝在方孔的中心，成四十五度左右的角，便成了。（如圖一）</p>
<p>玩法：用鏡的頂端伸出牆角或門隙外，把鏡頂端的方孔對準要窺望的目的地，然後在鏡下端的方孔中，對準玻璃看，就能在玻璃中看到外面的東西。</p>
<p>二帆船：</p>
<p>材料：木板，竹筷，卡紙，鋸子，鉛筆，英尺，釘，剪刀，線，。</p>
<p>做法：取一塊五六吋長二三吋闊四五分厚的木板，把一端鋸成尖頭，一端做成圓形，用一條長木做船骨，釘住在船的底上，在船骨上釘上釘上一枚釘，使船身有了重心，可以穩定。同時用兩隻竹筷做成桅桿，把船身打兩個小孔，桅桿插入兩個小孔。同時剪下四片長方形的卡紙穿在竹做的桅桿上，作爲風帆，便成了。（如圖二）</p>
<p>小朋友們，倘你們要它自已能前進，而不要依賴風力的話。那麽祇要把圓形的一頭，鋸成凹形，把一條牛皮筋，套在凹形的左右兩端，另外鋸一塊比凹形小一些的木板，嵌在牛皮筋中間，把那小木板繞緊，放在水中，便能潑水前進。（如圖三）</p>
<p>玩法：放在一條狹長的水沼中，一陣風吹來，那帆船便很穩快的進行了。</p>

<p>「是的，是的！」</p>
<p>「爲什麽呢？」先生又這樣問。</p>
<p>「我們是中國人，中國人就應當愛中國，愛中國應就當愛用中國貨！」愛華立起來說：</p>
<p>大家拍起手來，先生點點頭。</p>
<p>「外國帝國主義的國家，運商品到我們中國來换我們的金錢，我們把金錢給了他們，我們是一天天貧弱了，他們是一天天富强了，這樣下去，我們就要亡國、亡了國，我們就是亡國奴！」我再站起來說。</p>
<p>「那末我們就不應當用外國貨了！」先生說。</p>
<p>「是的，是的；」我們回答着。</p>
<p>「但是你們用的不是還有許多不是國貨麽？」</p>
<p>我們的臉都紅了起來，看看自已的衣裳，看看用的鉛筆和紙頭，愛華羞得哭了！</p>
<p>「你們不用得着急，也不要哭吧！我們旣然知道了過失，就不要再犯，聖人也有過失呢？我們只要勇於改過，就不失爲一個中國的好學生愛中國的好學生，從今天起，我們就一致用國貨吧！」「從今天起，我們專用國貨了！」我們宜誓着：</p>

<p>（六）這是我國蒙古地方的小朋友，他們住的地方是很多沙漠的，他們喜歡做畜牧的生活，所以他們都善於騎馬，而且身體很强壯。</p>
<p>（七）這小朋友生在珫球羣島裹面的，本來也是我國的同胞，後來給日本把琉球搶去了，現在他們做着日本的小奴隸，小朋友！史們要立志扶助他們脫離苦海呀。</p>

<p>— 余鳴</p>
<p>不久以前，英法兩國的外交當局曾以「安全保障」問題在日内瓦發生正面衝突，致使軍縮會議無形停　頓，歐洲局勢爲之僵化。乃經不多時，法外長巴爾都突然往遊倫敦，隨卽英法恊调之消息卽被傳了出來。於是，英意贊同東歐互助公約，蘇聨將於兩禮拜内加入國際聨盟，歐洲局勢之變化，已成爲了當前國際政治上的一重大問題。</p>
<p>我們知道，倫敦的政治家自來就是不高興任何一國與之爭霸歐洲的。在歐戰以前，因爲德國的勢力擴張，處處威脅着英國的盟主地位，使之不得不聨法俄以對付新起的德國，及至戰後，德國的武裝被解除，殖民地被奪取，已散失了與英爭霸的能力；同時，在另一方面，法國挾凡爾賽系統以虎視歐羅巴，其陸海空軍之擴張，其經濟勢力之增大，其政治地位之高揚，在在都足以使不列顚帝國感到不安；所以「揚德抑法」便成爲了戰後英國在歐洲的外交政策的中心。最近，因爲法蘇親善，德波携手，意奥匃的聨盟，法意兩總揆之會盟於威尼斯，歐洲各國的縱橫捭闔的外交政策，互相勾結的形勢，已具體地表現了出來，在此情形下，假使法蘇邦交日趨親善，波羅的海與巴爾幹各小國更護衛於其左右，自可使倫敦方面感到不安；同時，意德的親近，其勢有發展到實現中歐聨盟的可能，對於英國，也有同樣的威脅作用；而最近意大利的擴充海軍，大造軍艦，更爲以海上霸王自命的英國所難坐視。於是，倫敦的外交家爲了要緩和英法的衝突，爲了要預防各種可能發生的危機，便不得不在表面上稍變其過去的外交政策；於是，巴爾都倫敦之行才未落空，英法暫時恊調才成爲了事實。</p>
<p>然而，若謂從此英法已完全諒解，歐洲局勢已趨向和平，仍是與客觀事實不合的。所謂英法恊調，主要的表現，是在英國之承認法國的安全保障計劃，贊同東歐互助公約，並不足以言英法已於各方面得到了完全的諒解。而且，法國的安全保障計劃，所謂東歐互助公約，實是在防制德國；但倫敦方面則是以德國軍備平等與安全保障並提，其意是在：一方面贊同巴黎計劃，使德國在某種限度内就範，重回日内瓦，以緩和英法衝突，另一方面又扶助德國重整軍備，以對付法蘭西；同時，隨着英國改變態度的意大利更具體地表示着：「意大利之不反對東歐互助化約者，其故有三：（一）意大利確知此公約並非反對德國，（二）意大利以爲此項公約，係承認德國的軍備平等權，（三）······」··——於此可見就在東歐互助公約上，英法意等國也是各懹鬼胎，意見不能一致的。最近法國已有一部份報紙對英外相西門的言論大表不滿，居然宣稱其聽了西門之言論後「猶之獲一惡夢」；同時巴爾都也正式說道：「如有人向余要聽了西門之言論後爲訂立東歐互助公約之條件，則余不能加以承認。」這便是英法意見相左的開始表現。因此，我們若謂英法在表面上已得暫時恊調則可，若說它們已完全諒解，乃至說歐洲局勢已趨向和平，則便是謬誤之見。</p>
<p>至於德法，法意，德奥意乃至英法的根本矛盾，不但沒有解决，而且正在發展。要解决這些矛盾，最後只有戰爭。在戰爭爆發期尙未到來前，卽在帝國主義列强的戰爭準備尙未充分前，牠們自不得不以各種方法來緩和其現實的矛盾，以便實際地準備戰爭。所謂英法恊調，乃至意法諒解，其意義蓋不外此。今後歐洲乃至世界形勢之發展途徑，在表面上雖甚曲折，但其必有一總的目標，卽是走向戰爭。——這是我們所可斷言的。</p>

<h3 id="c318">水銀燈下 <a href="#c318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<p>— 幼羣</p>
<p>在時下報紙期刋上所登載的電影明星的生活，常只接觸到奢華快樂的表面；隱蔽在那些文字後面的辛勞和眼涙的内層，每每是從那班投稿家的妙筆下滑脫了的。事實上，電影圈衷决難容人作奢華快樂的好夢；那些在水銀燈下討飯吃的人們也决非快樂者的一羣。電影明星的生活决不如許多人所想像的那末理想和優美；他們全和般產業部門的從業員一樣，只是一羣工銀勞動的傀儡而已。</p>
<p>儘管有人把當明星作爲他們莫大的一個幻想，但水銀燈下的眞實却會粉碎他們的白日夢的。這裹，我首先得指出，這並不是一個怎樣理想的職業。我們不妨先從待遇方面說起，任何人知道明星們待遇的懸殊的可驚。舉例說吧，在中國，一個最紅的女星，一年可有兩萬元左右的進賬；一個大名鼎鼎的男星每月的收入却很少有超過三百元的。一個普通有點名氣的女星，每月從公司裹拿到三四百元，四五百元，五六百元，是毫不希奇的事；一個這樣的男星，無論老板怎樣提拔他，他是很難從老板的腰包裹拿到二百元以上之數的。一個初上銀幕的男演員，無論你有多大表演的才能，即使你的才能可充當片中的主角且曾被派充主角，你每月薪水，很難有超過三十元的。這樣不公平的對待這種「新進」明星，常令當事人發生一種莫名的憤慨，心裹必常在想法子來擺脫這個窂籠；但一方面殘酷的生活的現實又使得他們不得不努力保持這個「祿位」，而巴不得和老板們訂更長期的合同。我們能對這個生活上的矛盾現象，說什麽責備的話嗎？</p>
<p>這種不公平的待遇爲各影片公司開闢了一條覓取新的人才的道路。爲了要保證營業的勝利前途，老板們肯出更大的價錢，從營業競爭的敵方，羅致來那班在微薄的薪金裹鬰鬰不得志的人們。他們的大量與慷慨有時是很可驚的，他們肯增高僱員們一倍或三分之二以上的薪金。有些當過主角的人在原來的公司裹每月也許不過支取六十元，别一家公司却以一百元一月來購買他（或她）的勞動力，又一家公司甚至用一百二十元來請他或她去邦忙。（這裹只是舉個例。更有名的明星的工銀數値是更大的。她在原來的公司也許每月只拿到二百餘元，别一家公司也許用三四百元僱用她了。）當然，有這種被人爭先羅致的資格的人是不願和老板們訂長期合同的；一年合同在他們或她們是認爲最合適的了。</p>

<h3 id="c319">由米價飛漲談到目前中國的糧食問題 <a href="#c319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— 片山</p>
<p>一個月以來，由於天旱的關係，不但老農們感覺到種種的困苦，卽在都市的中小資產階級也同樣意識到莫大的危機。别的不說了，就以我們「衣食，住」中最重要的食的問題來說吧，在半個月以前，頭號白米每包還不過値九元二角，可是到了最近（十五日），牠的價錢却飛漲到十二元八角；僅只半個月的工夫，便　一連漲起五元六角。</p>
<p>吃頭號白米的，大都是比較富裕的階級。我們的勞苦朋友們能够吃到二號白米或者平湖白粳，已經是很有福氣的了：可是就以最低的平湖米來說，每包也自六月二十八日的八元二角漲到十五日的十元六角。在這種情形之下，再加以天氣的逼人，眞如近日報紙所　「下民無以爲活」的了。</p>
<p>米價的飛漲是事實，商人的操縱也是事實；可是這些事實只不過是一時的現象。在這一時的現象之外，還有根本的問題存在着。現在請來談一談這個根本問題。</p>
<p>查我國是以農立國的古國。在海禁未開以前，雖然有時因爲天災的關係，須稍稍借助於暹邏，臺灣等地，然而一般說來，總算還能自給自足：可是到了民國以來，這「自給自足」便漸漸被打破了。國產米越來越不敷自用，西洋米却如潮水似地流進來了。關於洋米輸入的情形，請看下表：</p>
<p>民國元年　二·七○○·四九三擔</p>
<p>民國五年　一一·二八四·○二五</p>
<p>民國十年　一○·六三四·五六○</p>
<p>民國十五年　一八·七二○·七七七</p>
<p>民國二十年　一○·七四○·八一○</p>
<p>民國廿三年　二一·四二三·○九一</p>
<p>請看吧，每年二千萬擔的漏巵，一億五千萬元的虧空。在以農立國的國家，竟有這種現象，這豈不是駭人聽聞嗎！</p>
<p>可是，請不要對着這個數字長吁短嘆：現在我們且來考察考察這事情的原因。</p>
<p>大家都知道：當帝國主羲用機關槍，大砲，這些武器把殖民地或半殖民地征服以後，跟着來的便是，以吸取後者的原料品並銷售自已的製成品爲原則的經濟侵略。可是這種侵略到了某種時期，因爲把半殖民地的一切經濟基礎都摧毁了，於是，後者不但在製成品上需要帝國主義的供給，卽在原料品上，也要同樣仰給於人。中國目前的糧食問題，就是此種現象中一個最顯明的例證。</p>
<p>年來政府雖有增加洋米進口稅之舉，然而因爲（一）我國最近米產之不豐，（二）交通不便，以及（三）苛捐雜稅未曾廢除的結果，反而把米價弄到逐步騰漲起來。</p>
<p>這一種逐步騰漲的趨勢，實際上只是商人們故意把持的，對於老農，是無絲毫的利益。降至最近，米商更藉着天旱爲理由，竟於半月之間，把米價抬高了二分之一，這是民食上多麽嚴重的問題啊！</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，如果單只是增加進口稅，這是絶對不够的。只有進一步，積極地增加米產，發展交通，認眞地廢除苛捐雜稅，嚴厲地取締商人的投機和操縱，纔能解除我們當前的災難！</p>
<p>關於合同方面，我不妨再說幾句話，那希望訂長期合同的人多半都是些初上銀幕的演員，她們或他們安於在三年中或五年中每月一律以二十元，三十元，最高五十元的代價，讓自已的身體自由受公司老板的全權支配。她們或他們當初頗以爲這是個不小的數目，而慶幸着自已和家庭的生活有了保障；孰知，這樣廉價拍賣自已勞動力的人多半都是些很有聰明很有才能的人，（女明星尤然）迨一上鏡頭與觀衆會面之後，馬上就會哄動起來，被認爲一顆亮晶晶的明星了，而她或他的薪水這時却仍是留在一個無名小卒的水凖上。她或他固萬料不到有這樣幸運的一天，内心裹也許失悔到前此對生活保障不應有的過慮；而現在老板旣因牠或她把自已的荷包塞得滿滿的，也不好意思不取出利潤的一小部，自動的增高她或他每月二十元或三十元薪水，或把這筆錢當作「酬勞金」分送給那些不很得意的有才能的人。</p>
<p>上面所說的是各公司正式的或「基本」的演員。此外，這有一種演員，他（或她）的確有某種才能，且適合某劇本中某特殊人吻的身分，但他却不一定適合某公司普遍的需要；這樣，他就只好短期的被老板僱用了。這就是所謂「客串」演員。「客串」演員大半是在合同上規定拍某一部指定的戲的。「客串」一部戲，最少的報酬不會少過一百；一百五十元，二百元的也有。可是三百元一部戲的却是不常見到的了，拍一部戲起碼的時間决不會少過一兩個月，普通三四個月也不能算長，六七個月，八九個月也不是沒有的。</p>
<p>客串演員之外，又有一種臨時演員。臨時演員大半是被僱用來作「活動的佈景」，鏡頭不多，地位極不重要，可又少不了他們，例如游藝不能沒有聽衆（許多音樂師也常是僱用的臨時演員），堂了裹不能沒有妓女，工廠裹不能沒有女工···於是大批的臨時演員就是非常必需的了。通常一個臨時演員一天辛勞的代價是一塊錢，也有一天能廉一塊多的。若天天有戲拍，每月最多可賺到四十元左右，比一個「新進」或「　　」演員的收」入還更可觀呢。（上海某大影戲公司基本演員的月薪有只有七塊錢的！）但有這樣好運氣的人却極少極少。</p>
<p>臨時演員一部分是失業的電影從業員，普通失業者和僱用的娼妓；一部分則是專靠「臨時演員」這職位吃飯的人。還有些好奇的紳士淑女們，他們以上銀幕爲樂爲榮，也間或在觀衆前來出出風頭。</p>
<p>像上面所說的演員待遇懸殊的原因，堂堂皇皇的說來是因爲才能（？）和經騐的不同；但電影園地裹儘有才能不够，經騐也不多的人也在充當着園丁。有一種演員是專彜自已身體上某部分特點或缺點　吃飯的。例如勞萊哈台靠他們胖和瘦，巴斯開登靠他的「冷面孔」等。中國影片公司裹有歡喜養胖子的，由是「賣肉「也成爲一種行當了。不管肥胖是怎樣地使人行動不便，可是爲了四五十元一月的薪水，胖子們不得不多吃些「猪腦子」，越把自已的身體弄得冥頑不靈，好來博取觀衆的一笑。還有利用自已「斜眼」等等的缺陷，在所謂「噱頭」的穿插鏡頭上出現，以逗觀衆笑樂的···總之，電影圈裹是無奇不有，這裹也不暇細說的了。</p>
<p>現在我想說一說明星們的</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>私人生活。即使是一個大名鼎鼎的明星，也免不了時常呌窮。他們的資格多半還只配住在霞飛路，福煦路，靜安寺路一帶比較漂亮的亭子間襄，西裝則有吳淞路一帶的商店替他們作好了，伙食方面，則他們也許是羅宋飯店的老主顧，也許是以大明星資格而兼充廚子這卑下職務的（自然不能一槪而論）。他們最痛心疾首的恐怕要算是公司一連幾個月的欠薪了。公司有時要靠某部片子「賣座」與否而定發薪的成數的，碰巧那部片子極不「賣座」，那他們就眞倒霉透啦，在各方面他們都將要感到恐慌的了。</p>
<p>可是某一些明星們仍是要拿他們有限的收入去浪費掉的。你可以在跳舞塲的角落裹發現他們在過着怎樣糜爛墮落的生活。又因爲男女間的解放與接觸的頻繁，一對情人是會超速度的造成。由是一對對的同進跳舞塲，游泳池，影戲院，咖啡館···也都是極平凡的。</p>
<p>因爲可觀的浪費，他們不得不作發財的幻夢。就他們的現狀說，他們絶難如美國明星般成爲「巨富」，於是就有一些人意存非分，不是購買航空獎券、就是購買跑馬塲或回力球塲的香檳票，以期不勞而獲。爲了要「出名」有些人的「登龍術」又不惜朝墮落罪惡的方向走。影星們的誘奸案，並不只是一次兩次見到的。</p>
<p>爲了要得老板，導演和影界聞人們的稱許和提拔，獻媚和貢獻自已的一切所有（女星），常是一個必要的手段。所以有些潔身自好的明星，寗肯跳出這黑暗的電影圈，不願同流合污。</p>
<p>最後，我要指出，許多明星們表面上雖似過着怎樣奢侈華貴的生活、但實際上他們不一定都是眞正快樂的人。艾霞的自殺就是一個最好的例子。</p>

<h3 id="c320">劉復先生與中國新文學運動 <a href="#c320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>— 少問</p>
<p>據報載，文學家劉復已於本月十四日下午二時一刻在北平逝世。消息傳來，學術界人士均爲痛惜；而且，在本報「自由談」上已有了壽同和陳子展兩先生的哀悼文章，對於劉先生在語言學上的努力及其爲人都有很公正的評價。現在，個人於哀悼劉先生之下，特將其與中國新文學運動的關係追述出來，以冀喚起大家的共感。</p>
<p>劉復半農先生是「五四」文學革命運動中的主要人物之一。在當時，劉先生之對於舊的文言文的反對與新的白話文學的提倡，有許多地方可以說比胡適先生都還要積極的。他的「我之文學改良觀」（載「新靑年」三卷三號）所表現的革命精神，若對胡適先生的「八不主義」說，便要算是更進了一步。這可由他這段話中見到｜｜「······此硬除迷信四字，似與胡君算二項「不摹仿古人」相同，其實却較胡君更進一層。胡君僅謂古人之文不當摹仿，余則謂非將古人作文之死格式推翻，新文學决不能脫離老文學之窠臼。吉人所作論文，大都死守「起承轉合」四字，與八股家「烏龜頭」「蝴蝶夾」等名詞、同一牢不可破。······吾輩欲建造新文學之基礎，不得不首先打破此崇拜舊時文體之迷信，使文學在形式上速放一異彩也。······」至於散文和韵文應當如何改良，形式問題應當如何解决，劉先生在此文中都有很進步的意見</p>
<p>劉先生對於詩尤有特殊的研究。他在「詩與小說精神上之革新」（載「新靑年」三卷五號）一文中說：「作詩本意，祇須將思想中最眞的一點用自然音響節奏寫出來，便算極好。」這樣正確的見解，恐怕是那些專講風花雪月，不注意「眞」的思想内容的詩人所永遠不能懂得的。然而，劉先生遠在「五四」時代就發表了出來，這不能不令我們敬佩。至其在此對於儒家的攻擊，更是表現出了非常大膽的精神，他竟公然地宣佈了數千年來被中國人民尊爲聖人的孔老二之删「詩經」爲罪大惡極，他說孔氏「簡直是中國文學上的最大的罪人！」</p>
<p>同時，劉先生不但在新文學運動的理論上有輝煌的供獻，而且還用白話作了許多新詩與文言文的創作對抗。我們可以說他是理論家，批評家，也是創作家，詩人。他的「相隔一層紙」與「學徒苦」等詩作，都是以新的意識和新的形式完成的。在當時，胡適與沈尹默諸先生雖亦曾以白話文作詩，但都爲舊詩的形式所囿，未敢打破舊的規律，以散文的形式來寫詩；但在「新靑年」四卷五號上劉復先生卽開始了「無韵詩」的嘗試，他的「賣蘿蔔入」，便是在中國最早出現的「無韵詩」之一。</p>
<p>自然，劉先生的詩作，不僅在形式上有許多缺點，而且在内容上也充滿了人道主義的意識；這在目前看來，當然是算落後的了。但在當時一般的文化水準之下，在那樣的啟蒙運動中，劉先生居然能創作出那樣的作品，我以爲仍是難得的。</p>
<p>正如「五四」文學革命未能澈底一樣，在劉先生的對於新文學運動的意見中，不消說也是有許多不澈底的意見的。但這責任不能由劉先生全負，主要的負責者應該是中國社會。因爲在當時的中國社會情况之下，只能產生出那樣的文學革命，也只能產生出劉先生們那樣的對於文學革命的意見。而且，卽令劉先生有不澈底的地方，我們也不能因之否認其在中國新文學運動中的功績。</p>
<p>但是，現在劉先生已去世了，我們除了繼續「五四」新文學運動的精神，努力更新的文學革命外，恐怕只有痛惜了吧。</p>
<h3 id="c321">外埠郵政代辦所批業，批局，批銀的防刦公約 <a href="#c321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— 何恨塵</p>
<p>潮州通訉</p>
<p>「批業」，在這裹你不要以爲是拿着硃砂筆專門寫「此批」「照凖」的大小官老爺的行當，或是江湖術士的「批命」生涯。「批局」也不是官老爺的衙門或是課命館。而「批銀」呢，看來似乎是一種經濟金融學的術語，但你若要在書本上討求出這個名詞，那你卽使翻破了所有經濟金融學的書籍都找不出來的。當然，對於它們的「防刦公約」也是莫名其妙的了。這三個名辭其實都同出一門事業，這事業很奇特，想來讀者諸君都不很知道的吧？那末，讓我在這裹來給你們解釋一下：這是有鄉土性的，它的出處是廣東潮州。</p>
<p>說起潮州，你會想起它是唐代大文豪韓愈先生來這裹做過刺吏的地方。因爲轉先生在這裹做剌吏的時候，曾做過一篇「祭鱷魚文」，這篇文章想來凡是受過舊敎育的都曾讀過，而我們潮州便因它連帶的印在人們的腦海中。但是到了今日，時代不同了，封建的文學，人們知道須要打倒了，「祭鱷魚文」，就不再給人重視，而我們的潮州，也連帶的給人忘記了吧？｜偶爾提到的也有之：那是上海的窮朋友們，因不能過生活，時把衣物送進當店去押錢，受了朝奉先生的奚落；或是死要裝面子的落拓才子，拿了不很多的錢到吳淞路去購舊西裝，受了店夥的刻薄，因而憤憤地想起這都是我們潮州人的賜予，而暗暗的咒駡。除此以外，我們潮州是很少能够走進人們的記憶中的。</p>
<p>是的，我們潮州是應該走不進人們的記憶中的。因爲這裹沒有給外國人開闢的租界：沒有外國人給造成平坦光滑的馬路；沒於外國人出資本開設大電影院，大跳舞塲，大百貨公司給人們以快樂和享受的所謂「商業區域」。也沒有美麗的天然的或是人工的景緻足供人們的避暑或休養。加之地小且瘠，沒有什麽特色的出產品，不爲人們所重視，固亦宜也。</p>
<p>但這是指全國而言，如是戰就廣東來說，那它在經濟上却也佔有相當的地位。</p>
<p>我上面說過，這裹是地小且瘠，絶無出產，爲什麽倒佔有經濟的地位呢？原來是其居民有大部份出外謀生。除了上面所說過的，在上海及國内各埠開設的典當業和估衣業之外，遠涉重洋到南洋各地去謀生的，雖然沒有人出來詳細調查過，但他們佔這裹人口的很高百分比是毫無疑問的。他們雖然也不過經營一點小商業，甚至大部份仍是給人做牛馬，但其所獲的代價到底比在國内的稍稍高一些。他們都是這麽刻苦勤儉的，把所得的一些糟糠大部份寄回這裹來，因爲人數多，合起來，便成爲廣東省内一筆主要的，大宗的收入了。據三年前的調查，這種收入每年約有一萬萬元。</p>
<p>我們這裹是沒有銀行的，辦理這種匯業的另外有一種組織，這種組織和錢莊差不多，我們這裹稱做「批業」；其機關呌做「批局」；所匯的欵呌做「批銀」。</p>
<p>但這種「批局」仍然不是設在我們潮州，而是在汕頭，因爲汕頭的交通比這裹便利，而且相距又較近。</p>
<p>這「批局」的營業法是這樣的：</p>
<p>每個「批局」必在南洋各地設有分局或聨號。那裹的僑胞如要寄錢回鄉，只須把錢同信件交給「批局」（如果是老主顧或有人担保，也可以欠賬，但須納很重的利息，並限期淸償），「批局」便開一張單子連同寄銀者的信件，按照那時營業的多寡，多者一月數次，寡者一月一次寄回汕頭的總「批局」。總「批局」雇有很多「路馬」｜｜就是專司送信和銀的職員，一接到信，便備足現金，用這種「路馬」按照收欵人的住址送去，並爲之宣讀及解釋其家書，取得收欵人的回件，交由總「批局」寄回寄欵者的分「批局」，交給寄欵人。</p>
<p>這個方法是很古的了，但因爲其手續於寄欵收欵人兩方都極淸楚，便利，所以，至今還是很流行，通用。然而，到最近幾個月來，也不可避免的給世界經濟不景氣的颶風所吹，漸漸的衰微下去了。</p>
<p>原來南洋，甚至整個海外的僑胞，其所以能在海然造成相當的地位的歷史是由於歐戰。那時各國都忙着戰爭，把生產的靑年都驅到戰塲裹去了，無暇顧及後方。我們的同胞便「乘機而進」，跑到海外去給他們做生產工作，因此才繁殖起來。及至歐戰結束，又加之資本主義諸國家「爾詐我虞」，釀成了「經濟不景氣」，釀成了空前的大失業，這失業問題，他們自已也無法解决，那裹再能容忍我們僑胞來分他們的糧食？於是，造出許多惡毒的陰謀，對我僑胞，新的拒，舊的逐，我們的僑胞是無組織，無保護的，當然是抵抗不過，便驟然减少生路，這便是「批業」衰落的總原因。</p>
<p>我上面曾兩度說明，潮州是地小且瘠，因此，卽欲生產也缺乏原料。所以靑年壯丁是不能在本土立足的，他們唯一的出路便是到南洋去。現在南洋是「此路不通」了，這便斷絶他們的生路。世界上的强盜小竊都是因爲生活的壓逼所以「挺而走險」的，自然，這種失業的靑年的最後的動作，是不言可知了。</p>
<p>於是「批局」的「路馬」便常常被刦。在兩三年前，我們這個潮州有了我上面所說明的優美的環境，眞所謂安居樂業，盛世太平，所以，代「路馬」們雖然身上帶着透人的東西，也都絶對沒有人敢犯「王法」而來「光顧」，他們可以不帶武器而自由行其職務，歷來相傳如此，差不多成了習慣，不料時勢驟變，他們就無法應付了。當最</p>

<h3 id="c322">建設大衆語文的實際任務 <a href="#c322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— 丁乙</p>
<p>一、楔子</p>
<p>建設大衆語文的問題，已經討論得很熱烈了，且有幾個副刋的編輯在鳴金收兵，好像對這次討論感到了滿足或厭倦。其實我們只要留心自論戰展開後各人所發表的意見，就知道直至現在還沒有一個尙好的結論，各人的意見，還只是和瞎子摸象一樣摸到部份就認爲全體。而且對這問題的基本認識，也並沒有人解釋詳明，於是卽使淺學如我，也不能不來湊湊熱鬧，提出一點意見了。</p>
<p>二、建設大衆語是大衆的實際要求</p>
<p>「什麽是大衆語？」這是一般人首先要求解答的問題，且有人以這句話作反對大衆語的口實，等於新興文學剛抬頭的時候，名流敎授們聲聲口口要「看貨色」的情形一樣。陳子展陳望道諸先生，以爲聽得懂，讀得出，看得明白，寫得出的就是大衆語，這當然沒有什麽不對，但並不足以解釋一般人的懹疑。朁如，有人問：流行的白話，不是寫得出看得明白的嗎？試舉出一篇大衆語寫的文章看看｜這便要無話回復·在現階段，我們對於大衆語問題的認識，不能認爲已有了定形的東西，只能認爲是因爲大衆的實際要求而正在發展着的東西。在帝國主義的猛烈進攻中，在農村經濟破產的恐慌下，大衆的殊死戰爭使他們迫切要求創造自已的文化以至要求建設表達自已生活的語文形式，乃是必然的結果。大衆語問題，不是單純的語文問題而是配合着大衆反帝反復古運動而來的，離開了大衆的實踐，大衆語便無從建立。「拿貨色看」，倘我們從這樣的認識出發，我們便知道這是一句多麽愚昧欺人的話。試問，中山先生爲中國大衆的要求，首倡民族革命的當時，是不是可以拿出什麽貨色來看呢？</p>
<p>三、是自然發展抑是意識運動</p>
<p>有些人把建設大衆語問題，當成是語言自然發展的問題而提出。不錯，從白話到大衆語，可以說，大衆語是白話的向上發展，猶之資本主義是從封建社會發展出來的一樣。白話的本身，就含有大衆語的成份，然而，在這裹，不能忘記的，是社會的進化，除了自然發展的法則外，還有一種意識運動。社會是時時刻刻在矛盾中進展着的，當這矛盾擴大到足以妨礙其自身的進步時，於是就需要一種力來推動，這推動，就有「反」的意思。目前的提出建設大衆語，無疑的是一種意識運動，無疑的是因爲白話已爲官僚買辦所竊持，已喪失了它的進步性，要把它推進到大衆語的階段，便需要力，便需要不僅對企圖死灰復燃的文言，而且對失了進步性的白話的鬥爭。和平的發展，適足以使白話愈向文言，洋八股投降，要想把它提高和糾正，那更是不可能的了。</p>
<p>四、從那裹做起</p>
<p>離開了整個文化運動，離開了大衆的實踐，大衆語問題是無由解决的，那末，我們怎樣開始建設呢？這就似乎成了一個難關。胡愈之先生主張先創造音符文字，陶和行先生主張先要敎育大衆。胡先生的意見，只能當做這運動的一個終極目標，在現在提出來，確有取消這運動的危險，因爲一種文字變更决非一時所能成功，决不能因爲沒有音符字便不能談大衆語問題，陶先生如果把敎育當成學校形式的敎育看，也不是好的辦法，陶先生自已的敎育經騐，大約已獲得了不少的敎訓。我以爲：</p>
<p>（一）如前面所說，大衆語是大衆的實際</p>
<p>建設大衆語的現在，必然先要充實大衆文化鬥爭的生活内容，加强大衆反帝反復古運動的力量，有了豐富的生活内容才會產生健全的表逹這内容的形式。</p>
<p>（二）從發展土語方言文學促成語文的統一，使之走上音符字的前途，且只有這樣才能使這運動與各地大衆的實際生活相配合。</p>

<p>初發現有强盜會打刦的時候，他們也隨帶手槍，但一遇到强盜，他們便失去了運用手槍的方法和膽量；結果必是連銀子和手槍一同給搶去。而强盜搶得手槍，便更加「如虎添翼」了。這也是「批業」衰落的一個顯明的原因。</p>
<p>「批業」受着大大的打擊了，他們便去找尋補救之法，第一個原因是他們所不甚明瞭，而且也並非他們這局部的力量所能解决的；他們只好在第二個原因上希圖挽救。在不久之前，他們便召集同業公會，議决了這個一防刦公約。」</p>
<p>這公約的全文如次：</p>
<p>（一）「批銀」在路被刦，附近鄉里須立卽出救。能當塲拿獲正賊賊，會同本公會送官訊實定罪後，每獲正賊一名，由公會賞花紅大洋二百元。</p>
<p>（二）「批銀」在路被刦，附近鄉里立卽出救，能當塲拿獲正賊，並將所搶批銀奪回者，除實行第一條外，其所奞回之批銀每千元由失主抽出二百元以爲賞銀。</p>
<p>（三）鄉里出救，被賊所傷；重者給醫藥費五千元；輕者酌賞；因重傷成殘廢者加賞善後費大洋二百元。</p>
<p>（四）鄉里出救，被重傷致死者給撫恤費大洋五百元。</p>
<p>（五）「路馬」被擄，公會不任贖回之責，被擄而致死傷時則由公會酌卹。</p>
<p>（六）在船在陸，賞卹同上。</p>
<p>（七）「路馬」遇險，附近鄉里如坐視不救，除呈官究問外，並通知外洋批局，停止該處批銀。</p>
<p>這個公約，只是「頭痛醫頭」「脚痛醫脚」的消極辦法，而這消極的辦法的效用，据我想：也等於零度，因爲「正賊」就是期待來救護的「鄉里」呵！</p>
<p>從這一點便可以看到現在潮州社社的整個狀態！</p>

<p>— 叔麟</p>
<p>齊柏林初造的飛行船，六隻均破壤未成。第七隻全長五百呎，仍爲暴風擊成粉碎。</p>
<p>因屢屢發生事故，各國一時對於製造飛行船事冷淡下來。尤以世界大戰開始，各國專注意於飛行機的製造，龐大的飛行船更不措意。</p>
<p>獨德國在列國漠視中，成就了齊柏林式的大飛行船。全長五百餘呎，全身隔成幾小部分，其中每一部都裝有輕氣袋，如被槍礮繟擊毁其一，飛行船决不致墜落。齊柏林飛行船爲硬式，全體骨骼用鋁的合金造成，幔以亞麻布，内部氣球以牛腸皮作成。</p>
<p>歐戰時，德國在敵軍四面包圍中，｀絶不作惴惴之態，而在此怪物中裝滿爆彈，夜間通過聨合軍陣地，越杜白海峽，悠悠然遠襲英京倫敦。不特使倫敦人民被爆彈之害，更使人心大受威脅。</p>
<p>接着，我們來談談齊柏林伯爵，齊柏林的一生更是發揮德國式精神的好模範。</p>
<p>四　關於齊柏林伯爵</p>
<p>齊柏林式飛行船的發明家斐爾其那特豐齊柏林，千八百三十八年七月八日生於德康司丹司湖畔伯爵家。有着北部德人氣質的伯爵，自幼便富豪毅性質，活潑好遊，據傳，其自幼卽對於自然科學有特殊興趣。</p>
<p>齊柏林長大後入陸軍士官學校，爲德將校而遠涉至美。時美南北戰爭正開始。有一次齊柏林和二三同僚往遊那約伽拉瀑布，齊柏林說：</p>
<p>「這瀑布在陸上看沒有甚麽趣味，游泳着看才好。」說着便不顧友人的勸阻一躍入急流，游泳着鑒賞。這事雖不免鹵莽，但齊柏林之精神於此不能不令人欽佩。</p>
<p>不久他回德，適普法戰事開始。八十五萬的德軍，因名將毛蓋巧妙的作戰，侵入法國，在賽登擒獲拿破嵛三世，進圍巴黎首府，巴黎市民頑强抵抗四月，終以力竭開城納降。</p>
<p>這是巴黎圍城中的事情。</p>
<p>齊柏林伯爵亦以一部將從軍，某日見巴黎城中一氣球高飛空中，氣球扶搖直上，因風吹而飛越德軍陣地，向遠處田舍流去。在下面看着的的兵咸兀然守着自已陣地，不知所以，惟恐這氣球與城外法軍互通聲氣傳佈密令。</p>
<p>齊柏林見此氣球，大爲感佩。</p>
<p>此後齊柏林遂埋頭於飛行船的研究，此事實爲其動機。</p>
<p>齊柏林在此戰因功任大佐，再升少將，進而被選爲軍事參議官干與干與政事。至五十三歲，退職歸田舍。</p>
<p>功成名爱之後，齊氏並不如一般人之風花雪月以樂餘年，以五十三歲之老靑年，企圖作飛行船的發明。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c326">「大衆語」在電影中之運用（下） <a href="#c326" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e326" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">326</a></h3>
<p>— 丹楓</p>
<p>一般的說，在一個民族之中，應當保存其不同的語言形式之存在，這和保存每一民族固有的語言文化，不能相提並論的。理由很單純，在自由獨立的民族健全發展上，應當使其語言完全一致，以構成統一的文化。假使說我們要維持每一不同的方言土語，那末就等於分裂民族的統一。所以，在電影上，我們可以攝製純粹的蒙古或者西藏的影片，甚至於苗民的影片，但是我們决不應當在漢族中有廣東影片或福建影片之分别。</p>
<p>進一步說，我們應當使各地的方言或土語，趨於消滅。事實上，當國内交通完全構通了各地文化的時候，土語方面，是不會永遠存在的，雖然現在仍然不能將全國語言熔冶於一爐。那末，我們承認電影是敎化的工具，由於電影的語言文字部份，將各地的語言統一起來，帮助着消滅方言土語之存在，乃是當前必要的任務，爲什麽還要提倡電影上使用方言土語呢？在目前，我們極反對廣東語對白的聲片之攝製。</p>
<p>關於這一點，我們不妨再舉例說明。「天公不雨，將如之何？」式找文言字幕·我們當然絶對反對，另一方面，「我們將怎麽辦呢？假使老天爺永遠是這樣吝嗇的而不肯降一滴甘霖的話，」這種深奥的白話，我們也同樣反對。再說，假使用我們家裹土話來說，那便是「易（這）個天總不落雨，衙（我）大家喲何（若何）是好？」試問這種大衆語，能爲一般人所理解嗎？假使翻譯成廣東話或福建話，將更不知道何等難懂了。所以電影所適用的大衆語，乃是一天不下雨，怎麽辦？」一種非常明快的語句。</p>
<p>記得前不久，申報本埠增刋有人曾經以浦東或寗波的士話，「×倷×倷」的整篇整幅，作爲大衆語的舉例，那顯然是一種惡意的曲解。大衆語决不是提倡大衆的方言土語，而是使語言文字從白話文中解放出來，使它成爲大衆所易於理解的東西。當然，這中間有着許多困難，特别是在實踐上，假使我們知識份子者，不肯深入大衆，不從實際生活中去發現和創造，乃是不會成功的。</p>
<p>至於關於電影的創作，在現階段中，我們還不能將各地的語言統一起來，爲了保持地方色彩的原故，我們不妨注意到音的分别，有如「小婦人」中那個德國意樂敎授，不妨帶着德國發言，而「藝苑狂才」中約翰巴里穆亞，也不妨帶一點俄國人的Ｒ的重音。而我們對於江南的題材，可以在發音上加重它的地方色彩，對於山東或者是廣東，自然也是同樣。這不僅是演員的技藝問題，凡是從事電影文化運動的人們，都應當注意及此。（完）</p>

<p>Ａｆｆａｉｒｓ　ｏｆ　Ａ　Ｇｅｎｔｌｅｍａｎ—國泰—</p>
<p>和一般庸俗的美國影片一樣，這裹沒有缺少男女間的戀愛糾紛、所不同者，這裹還加上一些偵探片所特有的成份。</p>
<p>故事的大槪是這樣的：一個文學家和許多女人有過戀愛關係，到後來就因爲這種變愛糾纏不淸，甚至於吿訴他僕人，他將自殺。於是僕人說卽使自殺也得寫一張「Ｔｅ　Ｐｏｌｉｃｅ」的親筆絶命書，以免連累他人。他依照僕人的話做了，可是結果他却死於僕人之手。劇的開始是寫作家之死，警察發現絶命書，再從某出版家嘴裹說到死者昨晚曾宴請許多舊情人，於是叙述宴客的當時及其在許多女人中間難於應付，結果於受了多次刺戟之後，而企圖自殺。最後僕人因其並不自殺，絶命書却寫好了，僕乃利用此機會，因主人姦淫已妻之宿怨、舉槍轟擊作家。</p>
<p>這一作品採敗了偵探片的形式，而其中主要目的却是寫作家在女人中之糾紛。劇作者除了在每一個人物之關係上　結構將頗爲緊湊之外，其他方面是沒有何等成就的。並於說他打擊作家們的以戀愛爲兒戲。結果是在無謂的糾纷中感受煩悶，那也紙是人云亦云，比較的他用了話劇相同的手法，使那些人物，緊湊的展開，並說明她們針鋒相對的矛盾。所以，那末些對話，假使將其當作話劇看，倒是滿有趣味的。結果，他吿訴我們，布爾喬亞的作家生活是那般淫糜，所得的代價，是給情人的丈夫打死。然而劇作者却沒有充分的描寫這一方面，假使主要的是在暴露他們的話。</p>
<p>導演者做到了劇作者所要描寫的程度，但是由於經常的坐着對話的原故，使劇在中間進行得沉悶異常。這種戲卽在「生意經」上說也不見得高明的。</p>
<p>從故事到演出，從佈景到攝影，都沒有什麽特殊可取之一處。甚至於連每一個演員都在内，全部是十分平庸。</p>

<p>— 林辰</p>
<p>對於小公司影片的評價，是一件花較困難的事；這部吉星公司出品的「爲誰犧牲」也不能例外。說它使人失望吧，却有一些可取之處：說它使人滿意吧，似乎又有些折扣。但是，當另換一種不很苛求的態度時，這部「爲誰犠牲」大槪與水平標準相差不很甚遠。</p>
<p>故事是一個舊形的：講女間諜的以色賺人。本來，這種體裁的故事是很普遍的，而加以一種强調，未始不能成功。但在「爲誰犧牲」的整個故事展開中，是非常平淡和固定。除掉二個軍官和一女間諜爭風談愛外，一些沒有新的穿插和有力的屈折。這一點是不能不歸咎於導演的能力不够。</p>
<p>「壽頭勿壽腦」中之一幕——南京映</p>
<p>演出一方面，第一個缺點就是對於義勇軍的種種設備，沒有翔實的考慮。義勇軍是應當隱匿在「靑紗帳」裹的。但該片裹却像十足的大兵：考究的隊長住宅，女秘書，堅固的牢獄，空着兵服在肆内飲酒，漂亮的司令和辦公處······此外，如兩個軍人的决鬭太長，金文綺（另一個軍人的愛人）出外又遇雨來表示失戀之苦太不符合。在演出這一層，我們眞的見不到什麽技巧。（下略）</p>

<p>— 乃煌</p>
<p>吉星公司的「爲誰犧牲」，是以一張義勇軍爲題材的影片。</p>
<p>它是寫着東北義勇軍中，有二個軍官，爭着一個女間諜的一件故事，其中頗有不妥之處，姑且舉出二點來講。</p>
<p>（一）怎麽義勇軍可以隨便在樹蔭下，與女子談情話的呢？（二）的確這一點是最錯誤了，那裹會有摩登化的傢俱，並且還有女人的照片，以及插着花兒的花瓶等等，讓他們在那裹過着舒適的生活呢？這是根本不會的。</p>
<p>這二點雖然是一些小病，但亦足以使整個的影片終歸於失敗。</p>
<p>致於導演的手法，太鬆懈了一些，使人感到疲倦。</p>
<p>致於故事的本身，亦簡直可以使人莫明其妙。令人覺得太勉强了。</p>
<p>演員方面，黃曼梨演來頗不合身份。至於張雨亭，吳文超等，尙很努力。</p>
<p>佈景太簡陋。攝影也平庸。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Establishment of a Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau to be Managed by the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Work Relief Plans to be Drafted by the Three Provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui (Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held a temporary meeting at 8:00 AM on the 21st to discuss drought relief matters. Those present included Wang Zhaoming, Chen Gongbo, Luo Wengan, Wang Shijie, Zou Lin, Qin Fen, Liu Ruiheng, Chen Shuren, Gan Naiguang, Zhang Daofan, Chen Xunyong, Zeng Zhongming, Chu Minyi, Peng Xuepei, and others. Attending as representatives from the Zhejiang Provincial Government were Zeng Yangfu, from the Jiangsu Provincial Government Shen Baixian, from the Anhui Provincial Government Fang Junqiang, from the Beijing Municipal Government Lai Lian, and from the Shanghai Municipal Government Wu Huanru. Chairman Wang, the President of the Yuan, made the following resolutions on important matters: (1) The government will establish a Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau, to be managed by the Ministry of Finance, and will convene meetings with the Ministries of Interior, Communications, Railways, and the Rural Reconstruction Commission to discuss plans. (2) The governments of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will draft detailed work relief plans, paying attention to agricultural construction, and submit the plans to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for review. The expenses will be borne by the central government. (3) Regarding drought prevention matters, the Ministry of Industry will guide and supervise the implementation by the provincial and municipal governments, without the need to establish a special office. According to Chu Minyi, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency after the meeting, today's discussion of drought prevention only determined relief principles, and did not discuss detailed plans. At the beginning of the meeting, representatives from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and from the two municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai, reported on the disaster situation in their respective provinces and municipalities. Zhejiang Province was the most severely affected, especially the area around Shangyu. After the reports were completed, relief principles were discussed. It was generally agreed that, due to recent continuous rainfall in various regions, there was no need to establish a special office for drought prevention. As for the relief of disaster victims: (1) The distribution of seeds will be handled by the respective provinces and municipalities according to the local disaster situation. (2) For work relief matters, the respective provincial and municipal governments will draft detailed plans and submit them to the Executive Yuan by next Tuesday. The Yuan will discuss them before the regular meeting at 8:00 AM next Tuesday. The scope of work relief will focus particularly on agricultural construction, such as dredging lakes and canals, to ensure smooth irrigation in the provinces and municipalities and prevent drought and flood disasters. As for the funding, because the finances of the provinces and municipalities are not sufficient, the central government will find ways to bear the expenses. However, the amount to be borne has not yet been determined because Minister of Finance Kong was not present at today's meeting. It will be discussed in detail and decided when Minister Kong comes to Beijing to attend next Tuesday's Yuan meeting. It is also reported that Fang Junqiang, the representative of the Anhui Provincial Government, has telegraphed the director of the province's Construction Department to come to Beijing to attend the meeting to discuss work relief plans next Tuesday, as the construction directors of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have both attended the meeting. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Vice Minister of Finance Zou Lin said that the organization and establishment date of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau will be determined after he goes to Shanghai tonight to consult with Kong. He expects to return to the Ministry within the next week. Relevant agencies will hold a meeting to discuss the main purpose of the bureau, which is to transport surplus grain from provinces with good harvests to disaster-stricken areas for relief. It is still difficult to decide whether to purchase foreign rice from abroad. (Special Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zeng Yangfu stated that Zhejiang Province is experiencing a disaster unprecedented in a century, with the three prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou being the most severely affected. The province-wide losses are estimated at approximately 200 million yuan, with 8 to 9 million people affected. The provincial government is actively providing relief, but its financial resources are insufficient. Principles for the disaster situation and relief measures have been drafted and submitted to a meeting convened by the Executive Yuan with representatives from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the central government's relevant ministries. President Wang personally chaired the meeting, emphasizing that the three provinces are close to the capital and it is unacceptable to leave the disaster victims without assistance. It was decided to provide work relief, engage in agricultural construction, and other remedial measures. The three provinces will prepare detailed plans and submit them to the central government for review and allocation of funds. (Special Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Abolition of the Tanggu Truce</p>
<h3 id="e2">Negotiations to be Held in Changchun <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Concrete Negotiations to Begin After Chaisan Returns to Peiping (Beiping) The Chinese personnel who signed the Tanggu Truce are scheduled to arrive in Peiping around the 25th to gather. Negotiations will begin after Chaisan arrives in Peiping. The main points of negotiation are approximately: (1) Urging the Japanese to quickly fulfill the matters they are required to implement according to the Tanggu Truce. (2) Abolishing the Tanggu Truce. (3) Crackdown on illegal Japanese and Korean immigrants in the war zone. (4) Ensuring that all administrative actions by the Chinese within its territory are not subject to any interference. However, whether the Japanese can sincerely cooperate depends on the outcome of Chaisan's trip. (Special Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chaisan is in Changchun, waiting to meet with Yin Tong to exchange opinions on the war zone issue and negotiate the abolition of the Tanggu Truce. It is reported that Yin will take a Japanese ship, the Dalian Maru, from Shanghai northward, going directly from Dalian to Changchun. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) An important figure stated that the reason why the war zone issue has not been resolved is purely because the Japanese have repeatedly made excuses and have a non-committal attitude towards all issues. Therefore, the prospects for the Changchun meeting are not optimistic. If a satisfactory result can be obtained at the end of the meeting, then details of implementation can be discussed in Tianjin or Peiping in the future. After Huang Zi went south to Moshan, his diplomatic plan for North China did not receive understanding from the central government and various parties, and Xiong Du remained passive throughout. It is reported that Huang sent a telegram to Peiping yesterday, stating that since his diplomatic approach to North China cannot be realized, there is no need for him to come north. All negotiations will be temporarily handled jointly by Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, and others, who will follow his instructions to negotiate with the Japanese, and report the progress of negotiations by telegram at any time.

<p>(Beiping) Chaisan telegraphed Otsuka, the Japanese military attaché stationed in Peiping, from Changchun this morning, stating that he is scheduled to return to Peiping around the 25th. He will hold concrete negotiations with the five countries on various war zone issues after returning to Peiping. (Special Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong stated that he will stay in Peiping for about four or five days and then return to Tianjin. Because negotiations with the Japanese on the issue of the Xin'an security team entering the war zone have not yet been finalized, it is difficult to predict when they will proceed. Progress is expected after Chaisan returns to Peiping. Regarding the financial difficulties in Hebei Province, he has drafted a plan for subsidies and submitted it to the central government for review. If approved, Hebei Province's finances can be balanced. (Special Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement today, saying that it has not received any suggestions from Nanjing regarding the Chinese government's desire to abolish the Tanggu Truce. According to semi-official sources, Japan wants to create a situation in North China where people can live together peacefully. If this guarantee can be provided, Japan may agree to abolish the Tanggu Truce; otherwise, Japan will not be able to consider such a request. (Roadside Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, there have been frequent reports from the Chinese side that China and Japan will soon hold a meeting in Dalian to discuss the cancellation of the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement. The Japanese Foreign Ministry completely denies this and expresses its opinion as follows: The Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement was concluded out of local necessity, so if harmonious relations between China, Japan, and Manchukuo can be guaranteed in that area, it can be cancelled in principle. However, although anti-Japanese sentiment has gradually eased, it must be acknowledged that it has not been completely eliminated and has not reached a state of peaceful settlement and employment. Therefore, it does not support the immediate cancellation or revision of the agreement, and there is no need to hold a meeting in Dalian. (Dentsu Telegram, 21st)</p>

<p>Agricultural Cooperation Committee Appointed (Beiping) The War Zone Relief Committee held its fourth plenary meeting at 10:00 AM on the 21st. Those in attendance were Yu Xuezhong, Lu Muting, Zhang Boling, Jiang Menglin, Zhou Zuomin, Zhang Yuanshan, Zhou Yichun, Tao Menghe, Xia Qingyi, and others. Yu Xuezhong chaired the meeting and reported on the committee's relief efforts in the war zone and its completion of operations within the allotted time since its establishment. The directors of each group then reported on the work done over the past year. It was immediately resolved to comply with orders to conclude operations today and to report this separately to the Executive Yuan and the Central Political Council, as well as to inform all relevant agencies. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. Furthermore, the Rural Enterprise Cooperation Committee is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting on the 23rd and has appointed Zhang Boling, Jiang Menglin, Tao Menghe, Zhou Yichun, Shi Jinghuan, Qin Dechun, Xia Qingyi, Zhou Zuomin, Zhang Yuanshan, and others as committee members. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Yuanshan, the director of the agricultural relief group of the War Zone Relief Committee, discussed the progress of agricultural relief efforts, stating that agricultural relief in the war zone began on September 1st of last year and has been in operation for nearly eleven months. Although there have been many difficulties during this period, thanks to the efforts of colleagues, progress has been smooth. This agricultural relief effort includes the two provinces of Hebei and Chahar, covering a total of 33 counties. A total of 1.6 million yuan in relief funds and donations has been allocated, distributed equally according to the extent of the disaster and the size of the area in each county. As of now, a total of 3,797 mutual aid societies have been formed, representing 179,746 households of farmers in need of agricultural relief, with loans totaling 1,425,707 yuan. Work in Chahar Province has also been difficult. The original plan was to handle Xuanhua, Yanqing, Huairai, and Zhuolu, but then they were ordered to handle Guyuan, Zhangbei, Shangdu, and other counties outside the war zone. The counties in eastern Chahar are barren and the people are poor. Since the disturbances last year, order has been very unstable and all industries have declined. All relief funds to be allocated, except for the entire amount sent to Zhangbei and a portion self-allocated by Shangdu, were escorted in stages by officials sent by the provincial government to other counties. Now that mutual aid societies have been established in various places, a spirit of cooperation is spreading. If farmers continue to run cooperatives and receive economic assistance, they should be able to achieve considerable prosperity after some time. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Passenger tickets to be issued starting the 1st of the month, covering five major lines. Shen Chang denies that Shihe came to Peiping to negotiate joint operations. (Beiping) After the realization of through train service between Peiping and Shenyang, the Japanese further demanded joint Sino-Japanese railway operations. Although officials are reluctant to discuss the progress of these negotiations, according to one source, the issue is no longer a problem. However, it is limited to operational and technical cooperation between the Beining Railway and the railways outside Shanhaiguan. It is reported that starting August 1st, Peiping will begin issuing joint passenger tickets, covering the five major lines from Peiping to Shenyang, Shenyang to Dalian, or Dandong, Dalian to Changchun, and Changchun to Harbin. (Special Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Recently, newspapers have reported that after the Japanese implemented through train service between Peiping and Shenyang, they will demand the connection and joint operation of the Beining and PingSui railways. According to Shen Chang, the Beining and PingSui railways were originally connected in the 13th and 14th years of the Republic of China (1924-1925), and both passenger and freight trains passed through each other. Later, due to military destruction, passenger trains stopped crossing, but freight trains continued to pass through as usual. Since June 1st of this year, all stations on the entire PingSui line have implemented domestic joint transport, and more and more vehicles are crossing the border. The old damaged connection points have also been repaired. All vehicles now run on the local line. When Shihe, the director of the South Manchuria Railway, came to Peiping this spring, he met with me. He is about to retire after completing his four-year term, so how could he represent the South Manchuria Railway to negotiate? Furthermore, it is reported that he has not come to Peiping recently. He has come to Peiping to avoid the heat and decline social engagements, focusing on reviewing and finalizing the plans for the Yuehan, Pingxi, and Lan railways, with a proactive attitude and no mention of resignation.

<h3 id="e6">Compensation for Injured and Deceased Passengers <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>To be discussed after Yin Tong returns to his post (Tianjin) Four seriously injured passengers, including Liu Erchi, from the Chadian train bombing case have recovered after treatment at the Tianjin Majie Hospital and will be discharged from the hospital within the next week. The Beining Railway Bureau's request for compensation for the injured and deceased passengers will be discussed after Yin Tong returns to his post. Rumors that six Japanese police officers boarded the Peiping-Shenyang express train on the 20th, purchasing tickets and recording them on account, have been found to be untrue upon inquiry with the Beining Railway Bureau. The six Japanese soldiers who boarded the train from Peiping on the 20th purchased tickets and recorded them on account in accordance with the Boxer Protocol. They disembarked at the East Station in Tianjin, which is not a rare occurrence only on the Peiping-Shenyang through train; it also happens often on other through trains. The Beining Railway Bureau has not yet received any indication of whether Yin Tong will be reinstated. Important official matters within the Bureau are telegraphed to Yin for instructions, but Yin does not reply and is temporarily handled by Deputy Directors Zheng Baozhao and Xu Wenguo. Yin's family recently went to Beidaihe to escape the summer heat, and those within the Bureau generally expect that Yin will not return north in the short term. (Special Dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>British Military Commander Refuses to Comply</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yi-wo, the colonel and head of the Kwantung Army Special Services Agency in Yuguan, recently notified the foreign troops stationed in Tianjin that foreign troops intending to conduct drills near the border of Manchukuo in the future should first notify the Kwantung Army. However, the commander of the British troops, based on the Boxer Protocol, refused this request from the Japanese. (Japanese News Agency Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Difficulties have arisen between the British authorities in Tianjin and the Kwantung Army Headquarters regarding the movement of British troops within the Shanhaiguan area. However, this matter is currently under discussion and a resolution is expected soon. An official from the British Embassy told a Reuters reporter today that the difficulties arising from the movement of British troops within the Beining Railway area are limited to the Shanhaiguan area. Since the Boxer Rebellion, British troops have annually conducted drills outside the Great Wall. The Reuters reporter learned that British troops conduct drills outside the pass based on the Boxer Protocol, and this issue is also related to the French and Italian troops. The relationship is smaller for the American troops because American troops often go to Qinhuangdao in the summer and do not come into contact with Manchurian troops. (Reuters Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers report that the commander of the British troops in Tianjin refused to notify the Kwantung Army Headquarters of the movement of British troops within the Beining Railway line. Japanese newspapers say that this attitude of the British commander may lead to conflicts between the British and Manchurian troops. (Reuters Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Kwantung Army Headquarters had requested the commander of the British troops in Tianjin to provide information on the movements of British troops within the Beining Railway line, but the British commander's response was not satisfactory. The Foreign Ministry considers this an important issue and is currently studying how to adjust Japan's position in Manchuria regarding other countries. The great powers sometimes contact the authorities of "Manchukuo" for convenience, but at other times they say that Manchuria is part of China. Therefore, the Foreign Ministry proposes that other countries should no longer consider Manchuria as part of China and is currently considering ways to clarify this situation and explain the international status of "Manchukuo" to eliminate the contradictions.

<h3 id="e13">The General Budget for This Fiscal Year Has Been Approved <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Over the years, our country's national economy has reached an extremely dangerous state. On the one hand, prices are falling and there is overproduction. On the other hand, purchasing is stagnant and unemployment is increasing. In this state of poverty, the hardest hit is probably the country's finances, especially the finances of the central government.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the national general budget for the 23rd fiscal year has been approved by the Central Political Council. The total revenue and expenditure are each 777 million yuan. By comparing the major revenue and expenditure items of the general budget, we can see that the shadow of the national economic decline has been fully reflected in the country's finances.</p>
<p>First, there is the tightening of the central recurring expenditure. Whether the national defense agencies and other administrative agencies have separately handled special expenditure budgets other than this general budget is something we will temporarily ignore. Just looking at the recurring military expenditure item in the general budget, it seems to be more than 100 million yuan less than the previous year. This is clearly due to the increase in debt expenditure, the substantial return of administrative expenditure to normalcy, and the increase in other expenditure figures. At the same time, the shortage of national recurring revenue is, of course, also a very important reason why this general budget has adopted a tight principle in its figures. Second, there is the transformation of methods for making up for revenue and expenditure. The central financial revenue and expenditure of our country have never been truly balanced or appropriate. In the past five or six years, due to the poverty of the national treasury, the authorities could not avoid the reality of "taking from and helping" the financial markets. As a result, it led to the phenomenon of excessive issuance of public bonds. Accumulated to this day, the expenditure of principal and interest on public bonds increases year by year, reaching a huge amount of about 258 million yuan. The direct impact of excessive issuance of public bonds is, of course, to increase the burden on the financial market and indirectly hinder the development of industry. At the current stage of the national economy, the methods for making up for the inadequacy of financial revenue and expenditure have reached a stage where they must be transformed. The fact that the bureau has already begun a trend of increasing tax policies in this general budget proves that the above statement is not false. As for whether the method of increasing taxes can completely solve the current limitation of inadequate central revenue and expenditure, that is a matter for separate discussion.</p>
<p>Can the policy of increasing taxes really solve the current financial difficulties? Even if the increase in tax revenue can be as estimated, what will its impact be? These are all questions that can be answered after a simple explanation of the content of the tax increase policy. In this general budget, it is estimated that salt tax will increase by 44 million yuan, consolidated tax will increase by 20 million yuan, and customs duties will also increase significantly. In total, taxes will increase by more than 70 million yuan. In terms of the affected commodities, salt is a necessity of life, so increasing taxes only increases the degree of difficulty in life. Although the burden of consolidated tax is said to be the most important for the cigarette industry, the burden borne by the cotton yarn, matches, cement, wheat flour, and other industries accounts for about one-third of the total consolidated tax. As for the changes in customs duty rates, they can affect the cost and price of commodities everywhere. In this way, the target of this tax increase is entirely commodity-based. Therefore, the sales status of commodities is the basis for determining the effectiveness of the tax increase. Our country's current foreign trade is in a state of daily contraction, and the important industries of the country are also in danger of collapse. After the bankruptcy of the countryside, if there is a major drought, it is a big question whether the people's consumption of goods can be expected to increase. This is where we cannot be optimistic about the method of increasing taxes. We believe that at a time when the national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, the result of increasing taxes will not reduce the crisis in government procurement, whether in terms of production costs or national livelihood. Therefore, we cannot see any method for solving financial difficulties in this general budget.</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) The Sino-British conference on revising the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway contract, held in Hong Kong, is progressing well. According to non-official sources, the representatives of both sides have reached an agreement on the distribution of the railway's income. China will receive 72 percent, and Britain will receive 28 percent. This plan will be submitted by the representatives of both sides to their respective governments for approval. The Chinese representative stated that the final approval from the Nanjing government is required before the proposals regarding the conference can be announced, and added that everything should be concluded after one or two more meetings. There are still some technical matters to be agreed upon, which have been handed over to the technical advisors of both sides for resolution. It is expected that there will be no need to amend the clauses in this regard. The main issue is actually in the financial aspect. It is expected that the figures agreed upon will be accepted by both sides. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is 110 miles long, and the British section, from Kowloon to Shenzhen, is only 21 miles long. When the railway was opened to traffic in 1911, both sides agreed that the British section would receive 35 percent of the surplus profit. The Chinese representative now argues that the surplus profit of the railway should be distributed according to the mileage of the Sino-British sections. The British side claims that the British section has several tunnels and that the engineering is more significant than the Chinese section, so the surplus profit cannot be distributed according to mileage.

The county magistrate and others escaped by civilian boat. The communists then went to the church, and he was abducted.

On June 28, he and a servant escaped from the detention center while the guarding bandits were asleep. They were quickly discovered, but they were not captured because it was dark.

<p>Tax-Free Purchase of Foreign Rice</p>
<h3 id="e26">Price Survey Required First <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Xinyi of the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association submitted a request to the Rural Reconstruction Committee to purchase 750,000 dan of foreign rice tax-free to stabilize rice prices, and to levy a tax of one yuan per dan upon import to establish a food transportation and sales company. The Executive Yuan handed it over to the Ministries of Finance, Industry, and Internal Affairs for joint review. The three ministries believed that it was still difficult to predict the extent of this year's disaster. Although rice prices are currently rising, it is uncertain whether it is necessary to purchase foreign rice, and there is no accurate statistics on the total amount of rice stored in the country. Whether the method of levying one yuan per dan in the midst of tax exemption and designating it for the operation of the food transportation and sales company is appropriate is also under consideration. Therefore, the results of their discussion, it is heard, are (1) Tax reduction and tax exemption cannot be designated for a specific purpose; (2) Tax increase and tax exemption are an overall and universal issue and cannot be reduced or exempted on one side; (3) Whether this case should be handled, and whether tax reduction and tax exemption should be granted, should be discussed after the Ministries of Finance and Industry investigate rice prices and rice reserves. Yesterday, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) As a result of yesterday's Ministry of Foreign Affairs' ministerial meeting, it was decided to incorporate a newly established fee of 2.3 million yen for the International Culture Bureau into the new budget, implement a new cultural affairs officer system, appoint suitable personnel to major embassies in key countries, and dispatch information offices to various locations to fully complete the overseas information network. In order to further enhance the functions of both, it was decided to spend 130,000 yen to establish Japanese research institutes in Paris and New York to promote foreign understanding of Japan and strengthen external cultural work. (21st, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' budget for the next fiscal year is currently being compiled amidst widespread attention. The issue of a major expansion of the Cultural Affairs Department, aimed at assisting diplomacy during times of emergency, has been decided upon with internal support. The total budget is estimated at 3.5 million yen, and the plan's contents are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Establishment of an International Culture Bureau (800,000 yen). This plan is essentially a major expansion of the current Cultural Affairs Department, aiming to achieve the purpose of introducing a unified Japanese culture. (2) Establishment of cultural diplomats, the highest-level agency for introducing culture and engaging in practical activities. Resident offices will be established in five locations: London, Paris, Berlin, New York, and Rio de Janeiro. Japanese Cultural Research Institutes will be specifically established in the two cities of Paris and New York. (3) Two million yen from the cultural affairs budget will be used to establish new Japanese cultural studies programs at major universities in Europe and the United States, and to exchange university professors. (4) Support the work of the International Cultural Promotion Association. (21st, Japan United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>British Navy's Claim</p>
<h3 id="e55">Unlimited Construction of Light Cruisers <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Vast territories require self-defense but must not endanger other countries. (London) The Navy League today issued a statement, insisting that the British government maintain complete freedom regarding the issue of light and heavy cruisers at future naval conferences. From this perspective, if the British delegation uses this statement as a basis for negotiation, then what the naval conference can limit will only be the number and tonnage of battleships. Regarding the battleship issue, the British Navy League's statement hinted that Britain only wants to maintain a balance of power with other countries. The statement further stated that Britain's overseas territories are vast, and in order to fully protect the sources of supply, the absolute right to build light cruisers is a necessity. The position of the British Empire is quite unique and will never endanger other countries. Therefore, no country should have any objection to the freedom of action that Britain requests for self-defense. (21st, National Telegraph dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Washington Star published a commentary stating that if Italy's plan to build two 35,000-ton battleships is implemented, France will have to declare the Washington Naval Treaty null and void in order to meet the necessary requirements. This is because, to maintain France's security, it is necessary for the French navy to be equivalent to the combined strength of the Italian and German navies. The new French Dunkerque-class warships are only enough to counter the pocket battleships built by Germany. If Italy builds new ships and reaches the tonnage limits stipulated by the Washington Treaty, then France will inevitably follow Italy's example. If that happens, France will have to abandon the Washington Treaty because, according to the Washington Treaty, Italy can still build 70,000 tons of new ships, and so can France. Now France has built several Dunkerque-class battleships, totaling 52,000 tons, leaving only 18,000 tons remaining. Even if the old and obsolete battleship France is removed from consideration, it can still add 22,000 tons. However, to be equal to the tonnage of Italy's new battleships, it is still 30,000 tons short. It is now heard that the British Admiralty is strongly urging Mussolini to cancel the plan to build 35,000-ton battleships, because the British plan advocates reducing the tonnage of each battleship from 35,000 tons to 25,000 tons. The Italian plan contradicts this British proposal. In addition, the British Admiralty believes that Mussolini's announcement of the plan to build battleships is deliberately creating a false impression, intending to obtain equal naval power with France at the next naval conference, and then allow the abandonment of this shipbuilding plan, because this plan will still be a dead letter at that time, and the construction of two 35,000-ton battleships requires 70 million US dollars, which Italy does not have the financial resources to do.

<p>German Newspaper Comments on the Value of the Eastern European Pact</p>
<h3 id="e56">Russia Wants to Eliminate Worries in the Rear to Devote Full Strength to Japan <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Berlin Börsen-Zeitung published an important essay on its front page today, stating the relationship between the Eastern European Pact and the Far Eastern situation. The newspaper declared that this extraordinary pact, as advocated by France and Soviet Russia, is actually related to the Far Eastern situation, and all the key points are particularly related to Japan. The newspaper also said that, from Soviet Russia's perspective, this pact and its relationship with France can be approved because its purpose is that Soviet Russia, given that a conflict with Japan is inevitable in the future, has to work hard to consolidate the rear in order to avoid being attacked from both sides. This is something everyone knows. If this pact is completed, then Soviet Russia's plan will be successful, and it will no longer have to worry about the rear. However, there is still an important point, that is, this goal cannot be achieved without the practical assistance of France. Furthermore, from Japan's perspective, after this pact is established, it will have the following effects: The countries that signed the Eastern European Pact, including the Baltic states, Poland, Germany, and Czechoslovakia, will guarantee that Soviet Russia will not be attacked in the rear when a war occurs in the Far East. In addition, in the Franco-Russian treaty, France has also clearly guaranteed that each signatory country must fulfill its promises. Therefore, France in this position is no less than a guardian of Soviet Russia, enabling Soviet Russia to devote all its efforts eastward without having to worry about its European neighbors stepping on its toes. Therefore, the Eastern European agreement is greatly beneficial to Soviet Russia, allowing it to focus its full strength on dealing with Japan. Therefore, from Germany's perspective, all disputes involving the Russo-Japanese conflict, whether direct or indirect, must be avoided. (20th, National Telegraph dispatch)</p>

<p>Inviting them to Join the Eastern European Pact, Poland Still Adopts a Wait-and-See Attitude. According to Moscow sources in Riga, Soviet Union Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov is said to have decided to negotiate with the Scandinavian countries (i.e., Sweden, Denmark, and Norway), inviting them to participate in the Eastern Locarno Pact. Once the understanding of the Baltic states has been obtained, the Scandinavian countries will be invited to participate in the negotiations for the conclusion of this pact. In addition, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck will soon go to the capital of Estonia, and when he returns to the country on July 25, he will stop in Riga. The Baltic states and Polish newspapers have commented extensively on this move. Judging from the tone of the newspapers, Beck's attitude towards the Eastern European Locarno Pact seems to be changing, but the specific measures will have to wait until Beck has talked with the representatives of the Baltic states before a decision can be made. (21st, Havas Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>The Polish government in Warsaw has adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact plan, which has caused considerable concern in French public opinion. Recently, the semi-official Iskra News Agency here issued a message protesting against French public opinion. The news agency believes that the relationship between Poland and France is one of the most important factors in Polish foreign policy, and Poland will never use any diplomatic means to reduce the strength of the relationship between the two countries. The news agency concluded that Poland should also maintain friendly relations with Germany, and that the degree of friendship should be at least equal to that of Franco-German relations.

<p>Signing a Joint Defense Pact</p>
<p>(Geneva) The three ethnic groups of the Caucasus region, Azerbaijan, North Caucasus, and Georgia, were formerly under the jurisdiction of Imperial Russia. After the Russian Revolution, they established Soviet republics and were incorporated into the Soviet Union. However, Caucasians abroad are still seeking to break away from the Soviet Union and become independent. The Georgian News Agency here recently released a message stating that representatives of the three Caucasian ethnic groups have recently signed a convention, the content of which is as follows: The signatory Azerbaijan, North Caucasus, and Georgian ethnic groups believe that complete independence is an indispensable condition for the development of all ethnic groups. Therefore, they have jointly decided that, in order to achieve this goal, they should unite the strength of all Caucasian ethnic groups and unify command. The convention consists of six articles, stipulating the methods for Caucasian ethnic groups to break away from Russian rule and organize a joint army for joint defense. The political system adopted by the Caucasian ethnic groups will be the "Caucasian Federation." Article 6 of the convention stipulates that the Armenian ethnic group is allowed to join this convention, and it is expected that Armenia will definitely join. (21st, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>The Seiyukai compares it to a menu, and the financial community calls it a painted signboard. (Tokyo) Various factions have criticized the Okada Cabinet's political platform and policies. The Minseito Party said that it can be seen from this that the new cabinet does not take extremes and implements the so-called moderate policy of President Wakatsuki. Therefore, it first expresses its approval of this point. The Seiyukai said that it only displays a beautiful menu, but there is actually nothing there. Words such as "consideration" and "reflection" appear repeatedly, and the evidence of no fixed opinions and no direction is clearly visible. The National Alliance said that it is nothing more than a list of political common sense. If only judged by words, it can get 100 points, but abstract words alone cannot be used to make a decision of approval or disapproval. The House of Peers said that the people expect the cabinet change to be accompanied by a declaration of a thorough policy to overcome the national crisis, so as to refresh the hearts of the people of the world. Now, looking at its policies and political platform, it is doubtful whether it can carry out thorough politics. However, there is only hope for the government's efforts and monitoring of its actions. (21st, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The financial community is very disappointed with the new cabinet's political platform, because its content is too abstract. The general opinion is that with the crisis imminent and the military budget bound to expand, it is said that we must seek a balance between livelihoods and revenues and expenditures. With no clue yet on emergency silkworm farming countermeasures, it is said that we must open up the economy of agricultural and mountain villages. All of this is difficult to achieve. Even its so-called establishment of a comprehensive industrial policy is currently only an ideal. Without seeing the facts in the future, it is just a painted signboard. Since no new flavor has been discovered, it is only waiting for its future concretization to summarize. (21st, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>

Therefore, some cabinet members complained. In view of this, the new Okada Cabinet decided to abolish the Five Ministers' Conference and use the cabinet meeting as the center to discuss important issues. Therefore, at the next Five Ministers' Conference, after Ministers Osumi and Hirota report on the matters that were not completed last time, it will be dissolved immediately.

At the previous Five Ministers' Conference, the background of the previous cabinet was heard. After the next meeting decides on specific issues, it will be dissolved immediately and does not need to be continued. The Navy Ministry and related authorities are currently discussing whether to set a preparatory period for studying countermeasures for the disarmament conference. If this is necessary, then a preparatory period can be set. The issue of appointing a replacement for the Colonial Affairs Minister has not yet been considered and can be temporarily held concurrently by myself. Also, regarding the issue of whether to convene a special diet session, because rural countermeasures have not yet been decided, it is inconvenient to state clearly.

<p>A US United Press correspondent in Rome learned from official sources that the threat of Japanese commercial competition is gradually being felt here, and Italy's export trade is inevitably suffering a major blow, especially in raw silk and cotton textiles. These products account for a large portion of Italy's foreign trade. Cotton textiles account for 30% of Italy's export trade. The domestic market has not yet been affected by the competition of Japanese goods. Businessmen here say that, with regard to raw silk, Italy can still compete with Japanese goods in terms of quality, but it feels no match for cheap raw silk. Two years ago, the low price of Indian cotton textiles had a great impact on Italy. Italy has suffered annual losses in the markets of India and the Dutch East Indies. Recently, the threat of Japanese industrial and commercial invasion has spread almost all over the world, but it has not had much impact on Italy itself. However, Italy's trade with the Far East, Near East, South America, and Africa has been greatly affected. (21st, National Telegraph dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The government today ordered that the entire textile industry be under the strict control of the Minister of Economic Affairs. All wool, cotton, and other fibers will be strictly distributed and issued to various factories. Any uneven distribution will be corrected. Each factory will work 36 hours per week to avoid unemployment due to a shortage of raw materials. However, factories that manufacture export products are excluded. It is also forbidden to build new factories or expand old factories. Manufacturers can revise prices or increase world selling prices due to increased costs, but those who try to make huge profits will be severely punished. The Minister of Economic Affairs has the power to fine up to 500 marks and close factories. As a result of the new order, Germans will have to pay higher prices for clothes and textiles in the future, and the German textile industry, which was already depressed, will now have to be subject to the authorities' crackdown, which may lead to further decline.

The Radical Party cabinet members and Executive Committee members discussed for an hour and unanimously believed that Tardieu's testimony had a partisan strategic political purpose and that the Radical Party cabinet members should properly respond to it.

<p>Strikes in Seattle and Minneapolis Clash with Police. San Francisco The general strike in San Francisco has ended. Except for 13,000 longshoremen who are still on strike, 150,000 workers have resumed work. Therefore, the ports of Seattle and Portland are now the center of the labor unrest on the Pacific coast. (According to the Portland Strike Strategy Committee, it was decided yesterday that if the governor orders the National Guard to come to the area, they will prepare to start a general strike.) Harry Bridges, chairman of the San Francisco longshoremen's strike guidance committee, recently declared that after the general strike in all industries, the status of the longshoremen is becoming more and more solid, which has never been seen before. From now on, he will fight to the end to obtain supervision of new workers. (20th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>San Francisco Strikers in San Francisco and Oakland are now gradually returning to work, but the center of the labor unrest has shifted to Minneapolis today. Truck drivers there are creating disturbances, and 35 people have been shot and wounded, which is a serious situation. 3,500 National Guardsmen have been ordered to enter the city to maintain order and security. Governor Olson is considering whether to issue a declaration of martial law, but unless the situation worsens, the governor may not implement this emergency plan. The riots started when police escorted a truck loaded with groceries through the blockade area. Strikers saw it and rushed over in empty trucks. Their momentum was fierce. The police were unprepared, so they fired shots into the air as a warning, but the strikers ignored it and got out of the cars together, rushing directly to the loaded truck, trying to drag out the driver. Seeing that the police were outnumbered, they fired live ammunition at the crowd, and both sides fought each other, injuring many people, including several policemen. Riots also occurred in Seattle. Strikers attacked non-striking transporters with bayonets. The police quickly used tear gas to defend them, and the rioters retreated. Twenty of the strikers were gassed by tear gas, and four policemen were also beaten by the strikers with sticks. Those who sympathized with the strikers even wanted to use machine guns and small blossoming bombs, but this plan has been foiled by the police. The situation in San Francisco is still quiet. The strike has ended, and food is being transported in in a steady stream. The theaters have reopened, and all traces of the labor unrest are now gradually disappearing. Even those who sympathize with the strike have resumed work. Waterfront workers have not yet resumed normal work, but it is hoped that it will be resolved soon through arbitration. Portland shipowners have suffered heavy losses due to the longshoremen's strike, so they still want to proceed with their plan to open the port for trade. The situation there is quite complicated. The National Guard is prepared to take action to suppress any riots that occur when the shipowners implement their plan, but the union has threatened that if troops are stationed on the waterfront, a general strike will be implemented. The National Guard is currently stationed several miles away from the city. The strikers claim that the shipowners are afraid that a fair arbitration will result in a ruling unfavorable to the shipowners, so they now want to force the port to open.

<h3 id="e73">Longshoremen Are Isolated <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The longshoremen's and maritime workers' strike in San Francisco was dealt a major blow today because the truck drivers have resolved to resume work and have already loaded and transported the cargo now being unloaded by the shipping companies. This action by the truck drivers has made the longshoremen's strike completely ineffective, because the loading and unloading of cargo on the docks all depends on the truck drivers for transportation. Previously, they refused to transport it, so the transportation business was interrupted. Today, they have resumed work as a result of detailed discussions between the government mediation committee and the truck drivers' union. Although the longshoremen and sailors are still on strike, it is expected that there will be no hope. Today, San Francisco's industry and commerce are gradually returning to normal, and another 150,000 workers have also resumed work. The truck drivers in Oakland have also resolved to resume work, but they still refuse to transport goods to the docks in San Francisco and Oakland. The San Francisco longshoremen, seeing the situation, may completely fail and lose their jobs. Therefore, there is a possibility of expelling radical leaders. The Maritime Workers' Union still declares that it will not stop until the goal of officially recognizing the union is achieved. The police and the "Anti-Communist Squad" are still searching for communist organizations everywhere, and the number of communists arrested has reached 350. There is even overcrowding in the prison, so some of the prisoners have to sleep on the floor. (20th, National Telegraph dispatch)</p>

<p>The entire issue remains unresolved, Huang Fu's journey north will take time, customs offices are actively being established at various ports, both sides are preparing to discuss the war zone issue. Beijing communication, North China diplomacy, since the opening of traffic, seems to have made progress on the surface, but the entire issue has not been resolved. The Japanese, harboring aggressive intentions, are pressing us step by step. Their desires are insatiable. To seek a complete solution, various forms of constraints and prohibitions are present, creating obstacles. Moreover, the Japanese demands are excessive, making it difficult for both sides to reach a compromise. The difficulties within are imaginable. According to people from South China, Huang Fu, who is responsible for North China diplomacy, does not have a passive attitude. However, since taking on the responsibility of going north with the intention of "jumping into the fire" last year, he has been working hard and enduring grievances. For over a year, he has only created this situation. At this time, within the country, public opinion is divided on him. Coupled with constraints from various parties, frequent interference, he cannot smoothly implement the pre-planned measures in his heart. Externally, he is dealing with cunning and sly enemies, exhausting his efforts to cope. Looking forward and backward, he is surrounded by thorns. Without a comprehensive plan and overall solution, it is difficult to act as Feng Fu again. During his two secret meetings with Chiang in Hangzhou, no decision was reached. Chiang, seeing the smooth progress of bandit suppression and being overwhelmed with military affairs, urgently needed to return to Jiangxi to preside over matters. Therefore, he instructed Huang to stay temporarily at Mogan Mountain and discuss the matter at length later. Recently, calls from all sides urging Huang to go north are extremely loud. In addition to sending Vice Minister Tang Youren to meet with Huang to discuss everything in detail, Wang also intends to personally go to Hangzhou to meet with Huang. It is said that Huang has no preconceived notions about his personal position, but he must seek a proper solution before going north, so his departure date is difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Various issues planted by the Tanggu Truce have not been resolved due to Japan's barbarity, leading to negotiations almost every day for the past year. When the authorities signed the Tanggu Truce, time was pressing, and they had no choice. Initially, there was no room for foresight, leading to the planting of many seeds of entanglement. Later, when negotiations began, no comprehensive solution was determined, resulting in inevitable failures and losses in responding to situations as they arose. Since the settlement of the traffic issue, the important issues attached to the truce have been resolved, and the survival or abolition of the truce has become a problem. The Japanese hold different views on abolishing the ceasefire agreement, and this matter is unlikely to be resolved soon. There are currently many local issues in progress and awaiting negotiation. One is the establishment of customs offices at various ports. The Japanese have expressed their agreement on this matter. The Ministry of Finance has sent Gao Yuanji, Zhang Yongnian, and others to actively proceed in Beijing. However, Japanese troops have not completely withdrawn from various ports, and considerable procedures are required before establishment. In addition, the issue of war zones, such as receiving Malanyu, war zone security forces, and restraining Japanese and Korean vagrants, has also become a local entanglement. Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, went from Beijing to Changchun a few days ago to study the negotiation policy with the Kwantung Army authorities, preparing to negotiate with our side. Regarding this matter, our side did not formally discuss it before Shibayama left Beijing, only officials in charge such as Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming exchanged opinions privately. A formal solution must wait until Huang Fu goes north. (18th) Yutian Security Force</p>
<h3 id="e106">Demands Replacement of Commander <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>- Shi Yousan Manipulates from Behind -</p>
<p>- Han Dianbang is Incompetent and Weak -</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication, the Yutian Security Force, reduced to 1,000 men and renamed the War Zone Special Police Force, has been implemented since mid-April when Yin Rugeng went to implement the reduction by provincial order. On May 1st, the newly appointed commander Han Dianbang took office. On the surface, it seems resolved. Because the news is silent, outsiders believe that there is nothing wrong. However, the hidden dangers lurking within have not been eliminated, and the disobedience and arrogance of various units remain the same. Brewing up until recently, the various captains jointly telegraphed the province requesting the removal of Commander Han Dianbang. After the incident occurred, the province telegraphed Yutian County Magistrate Chen Baosheng to investigate the truth nearby and report it for disposal, and telegraphed Gu Rugeng to go to Yutian to resolve it at the right time. Yin has already left Beijing on the 18th of this month. The reason why the captains of the security force demanded the removal of Han Dianbang is that two of Han's followers, at the beginning of the month, used weapons to rob a wealthy household in the county seat, and were caught by Sun, the battalion commander of Han's unit. Thus, they used it as an excuse to drive Han away, accusing Han of protecting his followers, robbing civilians, and failing to manage his subordinates, and lacking command ability. They must choose another capable person as an example for the entire team. The province replied, ordering the two captured followers to be sent to the province for interrogation, but they were delayed in sending the case, quite intending to keep it as evidence of crime and would not send it to the province unless Han Dianbang was removed. As for Ji Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong, originally after commissioning Han Dianbang as commander, he wanted to use a quick knife to cut through the mess and reorganize the unit, even if it was inconvenient to proceed with the reduction, he would also cut off the unit's contact with Shi Yousan, but Han lacked this courage, and was extremely incompetent and weak, controlled by his subordinates, and instead covered up to his superiors in order not to offend his unit, thus allowing his subordinates to become powerful. Sun, the first battalion commander of the unit, was a former subordinate of Shi Yousan, and was exceptionally arrogant, colluding with Inspector Zhang Futian. In addition to the monthly pay requisitioned by the province, the rest were free to act. Shi Yousan also paid a certain amount of subsidy every month to make the unit not forget its roots and keep it for future use. Therefore, the province ordered the unit to reduce the number to 1,000 men, but in reality, it contained more than 1,800 to 1,900 men. If guns and pay were insufficient, Shi Yousan supplemented them. In name, it was a security force, but in fact, it was a group raised by traitors. Special Agent Captain Feng Shouchuan was originally a major bandit in Shandong, and his unit was even more unruly. Although his relationship with Shi Yousan was not deep, he was selfish and wanted to be the commander himself, driving away Han Dianbang. The purpose was the same as Sun's, so his name was also listed in the telegram demanding Han's removal. Because the province believed that the unit relied on the war zone as a barrier and refused to obey orders, fearing that it would cause more serious problems, it was extremely hateful, but there was no way to take measures, so it only used comfort. Han Dianbang's removal is therefore an inevitable trend. The date of the announcement will depend on the results of the investigation. Yesterday, it was heard that Ma, an adjutant of Shi Yousan's unit, had transferred from Tangshan to Yutian, bringing Shi's order to give some instructions to the unit. It is predicted that after Han's dismissal, the successor commander will not be pushed by the unit itself. (19th)</p>

<p>Feng Yuxiang said it was done by Zhang Zongchang's remnants. Jinan Communication, the special investigation team of the military law office of the 3rd Route Army Headquarters, cracked a large-scale reactionary military organization near Wangguanzhuang and Dahuaishu in Xinzhuang on the 14th of this month. The case has been handed over to the military law office of the headquarters for trial. Since the case was cracked, there has been much speculation in society. Some people even suspected that the case was related to Feng Yuxiang, which is absolutely incorrect. The reporter interviewed Feng at the Five Sages Temple in Mount Tai. According to Feng's statement, "I also learned from the newspapers about the fake military organization cracked by the 3rd Route Army reported in the Jinan newspapers. Judging from its content, it is just a kind of disguised fraud. They are all Zhang Zongchang's remnants who cannot make a living and came up with a way to borrow the name to swindle and sell appointments to deceive the money of the ignorant who want to be officials. It seems to have no other effect. Yesterday (18th), Tong from Jinan Mayor Wen came and also talked about this matter and saw the stocks. According to the speculation of most people, they all believe that they are scattered soldiers and ruffians who are extremely bored, using very little capital to print commissions and be able to exchange them for a lot of compensation. Such things are not worth the laughter of the knowledgeable." (19th)</p>

On the 20th, a telegram was sent to Beijing to report and request the allocation of large sums of money for relief. The telegram said, "Urgent, Nanjing Central Relief Commission Junjian, Xiao Yi Er telegram received.

<p>| Ceremonies Have Been Held Successively |</p>
<p>Raozhou Communication, Xingzi County in North Jiangxi (ie, the old Nankang Prefecture) is located on the back of Mount Lu and faces Poyang Lake. Although it holds the key point of the Gan River shipping route, it has not been able to occupy an important position in commercial transportation because there are Raozhou above, Wucheng in the middle, and Jiujiang below. The city is depressed, showing the tattered economic situation of the people. Especially land transportation is extremely inconvenient. From Xunyang to Nankang, travelers used to detour through the rugged Mazhong Cen in the mountains to reach there. The freight of daily necessities for the residents is extraordinarily heavy, and sometimes there is a shortage of porters, and there is no way to supply them. The Road Department of the Construction Department believes that Guling is a resort for Chinese and foreigners, and Xingzi Bailudong is also a famous site where Zhu Zi lectured on scriptures. In Jiangxi, which is striving for construction here, it is even more necessary to improve the traffic on this road. Therefore, a plan for construction was immediately drawn up, ordering the two counties of Jiujiang and Xingzi to rush to build it within a limited time to benefit merchants and travelers. After receiving the order, the county started construction this spring. Since the start of construction, the project has progressed very quickly. All the earthwork, bridges, and water pipes on the entire road were completed last month, and the opening ceremony was held on the 5th of this month.

As for the small dam built by the villagers of Lingbang in Xukou, since there is already water in the bang, they no longer go to the dam to step on the waterwheel, but carry the waterwheel back to the fields to draw water.</p>

<p>Ruanxiang Town in our county was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits speaking the local dialect around 6 PM yesterday (the 19th). They carried two rifles and charged in from East Street, first seizing weapons from the public security police station before starting to rob. Most shops were closed and resisted. Only the Qiancaizhang and Tongshoutang businesses, and a Tang family resident, who was a woman and was eager to hide and didn't have time to close the door, were robbed by the bandits, who took a large amount of cash and jewelry. After looting, the bandits went to Qiancaizhang to exchange for 13 new straw hats, and a fat-faced bandit wearing a willow-striped short shirt and black pants called for the team to head towards the Jiutu area in the southeast. When the bandits surrounded the police station, patrol captain Zhang Yunbiao, seeing the urgency, jumped over the wall and fled to Zhuangxing Branch to report. At the same time, a Zhang family resident in the town secretly went to the Songjiang Jiangzhuang Town police station, about six li away from the town, to call for assistance. Troops arrived one after another that night, but the bandits were gone. It is now estimated that the total loss in the town is over 5,000 yuan. In addition to sending Qian, the section chief of the Public Security Bureau, to lead the police to investigate this afternoon (the 20th), the county government has also issued a general order to all police forces on land and water to arrest and bring the perpetrators to justice within ten days.</p>

However, there was still no sign of rain. Starting on the 17th, Magistrate Zhang continued to ban slaughter for three days by order of the province, and all shrimp and fish were not allowed to be sold on the streets.

<p>To meet with the Japanese Kwantung Army authorities to exchange views on whether or not Huang Fu will go north depending on the outcome of this trip. The issue of the North China War Zone will be the focus of discussion. Yin Tong, director of the Beining Railway Bureau, went south last time to meet with Wang Jingwei, the president of the Executive Yuan, and then went to Mogan Mountain to report the progress to Huang Fu. He came to Shanghai a few days ago and discussed again with Tang Yuren, the deputy minister of foreign affairs, and others. At 11 AM yesterday morning, Yin took the Japanese ship Dalian Maru to Dalian. He will meet with the Japanese Kwantung Army authorities in a private capacity to exchange important opinions on various issues in the North China War Zone. Whether or not Huang Fu will go north will depend on the outcome of Yin's trip. Details are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Left for Dalian Yesterday Morning <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yin Tong, director of the Beining Railway Bureau, and two attendants took a car directly to the Huangpu Wharf at around 9 AM yesterday morning and boarded the Japanese ship Dalian Maru. They booked a first-class room at the stern of the second floor and stayed inside with the door closed. He was extremely secretive beforehand, so there were few people seeing him off. The passenger list used a pseudonym such as Yu Wang. The reporter boarded the ship to look for him, but initially found nothing. It was not until five minutes before the ship was about to set sail that Yin stepped out onto the first-class deck and looked over the railing. The ship had already cast off its moorings when the reporter caught sight of him and hurriedly called out "Director Yin" from the dock. Yin nodded and smiled, but still pretended that he was going to Qingdao and not Dalian. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Dalian tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Mission of This Trip <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yin's trip to Dalian was decided after meeting Huang Fu on Mogan Mountain. Although the North China War Zone has been recovered, all the aftermath is manipulated by bandits and vagrants, making it impossible to handle. The Japanese side is making endless demands and using the war zone as a buffer zone to blackmail us. The North China authorities feel this is the most difficult thing to deal with. Huang Fu is passive, and this is the main reason. Therefore, Yin's trip is intended to meet with the Japanese Kwantung Army authorities in a private capacity, clearly explain the crux of the war zone issue, and inquire whether they are sincere.</p>

<p>If they are, how should they be responsible for suppressing bandits and vagrants in the war zone, and how should they strictly stop all other acts of forcible occupation in accordance with legal principles? Otherwise, the negotiations will end there. Abolishing the Tanggu Truce is the second step. It will be handled by Huang Fu after Yin has negotiated a result, and then reported to the Central Government for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Four Main Issues <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Among the various issues in North China, the main ones, according to a certain important person yesterday, are roughly four items: (1) the reorganization of the security team of Li Jichun's old troops, (2) the withdrawal of the remaining Japanese troops at various passes of the Great Wall, (3) the roads built by Japan, and (4) the cancellation of the ceasefire agreement. Among these four important issues, the first two are the most urgent. Regarding the first item, the security team issue is related to the security of the entire war zone. The entire security team consists of 9,000 people, of which 5,000 are good people, and the remaining 4,000 are completely reorganized from Li Jichun's old troops. This security team not only does not abide by the rules and fulfill its security duties, but instead is protected by the Japanese and commits all kinds of evil. The remaining 5,000 good security team members have to guard these bad security team members. Therefore, all 9,000 security team members in the war zone are almost unusable, and security cannot be maintained. Therefore, the authorities intend to reorganize and train the 4,000 security team members of Li Jichun's old troops so that they all become useful teams. As for the second item, if Japanese soldiers who have not withdrawn from places such as Donglu and Malanyu, we cannot exercise administrative power, and Japanese vagrants and traitors collude, set up smoke and gambling dens everywhere, disrupt local security, and do everything they can. Therefore, these two items are urgent issues to be resolved.</p>

He then used the dispatch telephone to report the details to the dispatching section of the traffic department. The section notified the resident railway police station and the traffic section chief of the Jingdan section, and ordered the Yao Huamen and Longtan stations to notify their respective railway protection troops to try to hunt down the bandits. Also, since the Qixia Mountain stationmasters were all injured and unable to work, the Yao Huamen station was ordered to dispatch a stationmaster to take the 503rd freight train with the railway protection troops to the Qixia station to temporarily maintain station operations.</p>

Most of the ships from the Fujian and Zhejiang coasts to Shanghai are sheltering along the way, and the Shanghai-Ningbo liners have also been suspended. The China Merchants Putuo special service has also stopped running. Further details are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Hurricane Direction <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>According to the report of the Observatory, the direction of the hurricane from the Strait of Luzon and Taiwan has become north-northwest. The coast of Fuzhou will be spared, and the wind has blown to the Zhejiang waters, such as Wenzhou and Zhenhai. It is reported that the hurricane will not hit the coast of Wenzhou, with five winds blowing, and will be smaller in Zhenhai with three winds. The hurricane circle is 60 nautical miles around. Yesterday morning, the wind reached 120 degrees east longitude and 28 degrees north latitude. If it still moves north-northwest, Shanghai will inevitably be attacked. It is expected that the hurricane will reach Shanghai at 6 or 7 PM. But if it has not arrived at that time, the wind may have changed its direction. The Greater American Evening News said that, according to the Xujiahui Observatory, at 6 AM this morning (the 21st), the hurricane was about to 28.30 degrees north latitude and 120 degrees east longitude, moving to the northwest. If the direction does not change, it will pass west of Shanghai tonight. Its speed is still the same as between 6 PM last night and 6 AM this morning. According to the position reported by the Observatory, the hurricane should have entered the mountains of Zhejiang Province at 6 AM this morning, only about 160 miles from Shanghai. If it veers slightly east from now on, its full force may hit Shanghai. However, since this kind of storm is unpredictable, according to the opinion of meteorological experts, it may not reach Shanghai at all, or it may pass in a wide circle outside the border here and head for the Yellow Sea, which is difficult to predict.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Warning Navigation <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs has been flying a black ball on the top of the Great Bell Tower since 5 PM the night before, warning that the weather is bad and a hurricane is coming. At the same time, it is preparing a black cross mark for when the hurricane blows as a warning of the wind attack. Later, because there was no emergency notice from the Observatory that it would invade Shanghai immediately, it still flew a black ball yesterday. In the evening, a red light was added below the ball. If the wind arrives, two red lights must be hung. The Jianghai Customs warning cannon has not been fired because the time of the hurricane's arrival in Shanghai is not known for certain, so the black cross, two red lights, and the cannon have not been fired.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Pu'an Suspends Service <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Pu'an ship was originally scheduled to sail to Putuo yesterday, and all tickets had been sold in advance. However, the Observatory's warning was received that the hurricane was the strongest in the Zhejiang waters. In order to be cautious about navigation, the Bureau decided to suspend the Putuo service temporarily, informing the passengers to change to Qingdao on the 24th. Passengers who do not want to refund their tickets can extend their trip and take the original ship next Saturday.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Stop <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai-Ningbo liners leaving Shanghai were the China Merchants Xin Jiangtian and the Sanbei Ningxing ships, which were also going to Putuo. Most of the passengers had already boarded the ship, but because the Shanghai-Ningbo route was right in the path of the hurricane, and there was a danger of traveling, the voyages were temporarily suspended. If there is no wind today, the two ships will leave today. The new Beijing and Xin Ningshao ships in Ningbo also sent an urgent telegram to Ningbo from Taikoo Ningshao, ordering them to stop in Ningbo and not sail to ensure safety.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Various Ships Late <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Several ships from Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou to Shanghai have sheltered from the wind along the way and have not yet arrived. Ships entering from Fuzhou, such as Jing'an, Yong'an, and Jiesheng, did not enter the port yesterday, because they were all moored along the way to avoid the hurricane. Because the ships did not arrive, there was no South China liner service in Shanghai. As for the coastal liners and small steamers along the coast of Zhejiang, all services were suspended yesterday. As for the North Sea liners and Yangtze River export ships, they sailed as usual, but were prepared along the way to prevent the hurricane from changing direction. The ships moored outside the Wusong mouth are also waiting for the wind to advance or retreat to determine their course.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Huangpu River Prepared <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cargo barges, civil ships, and sculling boats in the Huangpu River were very strictly prepared, especially in the evening. After 6 PM, there were no sculling boats sailing on the Huangpu River, and most of them sailed into the old port to take shelter temporarily.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Five Days of Drizzle in This City <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Heavier Rainfall Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Crops Have Hope of Recovery Since the sweet rain fell on the 17th of this month, there have been continuous drizzles for a total of five days, until yesterday. The rain that fell yesterday morning was heavier. It had been raining off and on since late the night before, and yesterday morning, dark clouds suddenly gathered, and heavy rain poured down in an instant. Unfortunately, it was too short, stopping after 20 minutes. It drizzled again before long, and it stopped and rained until the evening. As a result, most of the summer heat has subsided, and the cool breeze is blowing. The farmers in the countryside are all overjoyed to get this sweet rain, and the crops have hope of recovery.</p>
<p>After Rain in This City</p>
<h3 id="e147">Autumn Harvest Can Be Expected Without Obstruction <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that since the beginning of summer, this city has been suffering from drought, which has caused the general public to worry deeply about the lack of hope for the autumn harvest. The high price of rice has also caused unrest among the common people. The municipal government ordered the responsible agencies to suppress the price of rice and purchased water pump machines for farmers to pump water and irrigate their fields. Recently, because of the sweet rain, the crops have been able to recover, and people's hearts have been greatly stabilized. The price of rice has also shown a trend of falling. According to the news obtained by the reporter's investigation, it is listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Rice Prices Gradually Fall <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The reporter visited the rice industry yesterday and learned that since the sweet rain fell the day before, rice prices have become slightly looser, and the rice boats in various villages were scarce due to the low water level in the rivers. If it continues to rain and the river water is higher, rice transportation will be restored, and the price of rice is even more likely to fall. Therefore, the matter of purchasing foreign rice may be temporarily shelved. It is rumored that the Soviet Union will transport a large amount of rice to China. The rice industry in this city does not have this news. Since the Customs Bureau has collected taxes on foreign rice, the sales of rice such as Burmese rice have not been as strong as in previous years.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Continue to Pump Water <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the farmland in this city has withered due to the drought, and the municipal government purchased water pump machines and allocated them to various villages for use. The fire brigades in various districts used pump trucks to pump water to irrigate the fields, and the farmland benefited greatly. Recently, sweet rain has fallen again, and the crops have had the hope of recovery. If the weather turns sunny and hot again and the farmland still feels a lack of water, it can continue to pump water to irrigate the fields, so most of the autumn harvest in this city can be expected without obstruction.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Gu Xinyi Returned to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Stabilizing Rice Prices Results in Satisfaction Shenshi News Agency reports that Gu Xinyi, the leader of the rice industry, went to Beijing on the evening of the 17th to meet with President Wang, requesting measures to stabilize the rising price of rice and proposing to purchase 500,000 dan of tax-free imported foreign rice to suppress the price. Gu has now returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. The Shenshi News Agency reporter has learned that the Executive Yuan has fully accepted Gu's opinions and approved the issuance of a tax-free import license for foreign rice, which will be purchased and imported successively by the Civil Food Control Design Committee according to the needs of the market. It is expected that rice prices will be stabilized in the future and will not rise excessively again. In addition, the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau, which is organized by eight provinces, has now been formally decided by the Executive Yuan to be managed by the Ministry of Finance. The shares that have been paid to each province will be refunded separately to end the matter. The Ministry of Finance has also found funds for the operating expenses of the Grain Transportation Bureau and will soon be able to organize and establish it.</p>

<h3 id="e152">New Measures for Sending Northeastern Army Dependents <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Taking the route through Suiyuan and Ningxia to Xinjiang, travel expenses of 100,000 are allocated by the Ministry of Finance. The dependents of officers and soldiers of the Northeastern armies under Li Du, Su Bingwen, Wang Delin, etc., who retreated to Russian territory after the anti-Japanese war and then transferred to Xinjiang, entered the country through Vladivostok and scattered in various places such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, reaching hundreds of people. Except for those who stayed in place and were given severance pay to return to their hometowns, 131 of them need to be sent to Xinjiang to reunite their families. General Li Du, former Deputy Commander of the Northeastern Border Defense Army stationed in Jilin, petitioned Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission with measures. Now, the Executive Yuan Military Affairs Commission has decided to take the route through Suiyuan and Ningxia to Xinjiang. The journey will start soon, with travel expenses of 100,000 allocated by the Ministry of Finance. The contents of the measures are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e153">Preparation for Sending and Route <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>After the Military Affairs Commission decided on the measures for sending the Northeastern Army dependents to Xinjiang, it sent a letter to the Executive Yuan, which was handed over to the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministry of Finance for review. The First Department of the Military Commission sent a letter to General Li Du, with the original text of the measures as follows: Measures for sending, (1) Preparation for sending, (A) Regarding the dependents of Jilin military officers stationed in Xinjiang who are currently living in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing, Commander Li Du should first conduct separate investigations and inquire whether they are willing to go to Xinjiang, as well as their parents' current positions and stationed locations, and prepare a clear list for verification. (B) After the above investigation is clarified, Commander Li Du will appoint escorts and prepare a preliminary schedule for gathering the dependents in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing. He will consult with the Ministry of Military Affairs to determine the departure time and notify the dependents to board the train on time. (C) All dependents willing to go to Xinjiang should be notified to prepare themselves in advance so that they can depart at any time. (2) Route for sending. It is decided to enter Xinjiang through Suiyuan and Ningxia, divided into three sections for transportation, as specified below. (A) From Shanghai via Tianjin and Beijing to Baotou is the first section. The railway department is requested to order all routes to prepare trains for transportation. (B) From Baotou to Ningxia is the second section. The Suiyuan Provincial Government will provide transportation by car. (C) From Ningxia to Dihua is the third section. The Ningxia Provincial Government will continue to use cars for transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Ministry of Finance Allocates Travel Expenses <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>(3) Funds for sending should be listed in a special budget estimate, and temporary advance payment methods should be provisionally proposed. (A) Subsistence: From the day of boarding the train, each dependent will be issued a subsistence allowance of four dimes (0.4 yuan) of silver per day. For the first section of the journey, Commander Li Du will prepare a budget, receive it and hand it over to the escorts for management and distribution, and report it after completion. For the second section of the journey, the Suiyuan and Ningxia provincial governments will check the number of dependents, estimate the transportation date for this section, and verify and advance the payment. (B) Car expenses: The expenses for cars used in the second and third sections will be paid in advance by the Suiyuan and Ningxia provincial governments and reported together for verification and reimbursement afterward. (C) The aforementioned expenses will be issued by the Ministry of Finance and a summary estimate will be made for special expenditure. (4) Others, (A) When the dependents are sent off on their journey, a telegram will be sent to the Xinjiang Provincial Government immediately to notify the parents to prepare for resettlement in advance. (B) During the three legs of the journey from Baotou via Ningxia to Dihua, the Ministry of Military Affairs will, upon the start of the dispatch, notify the troops stationed along the way to protect them properly.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Letter from the Executive Yuan to Li Du <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, also ordered Secretary-General Chu Minyi to send a letter to General Li Du, the original text of which reads: "Following the instruction of President Wang, the case was checked and the official letter from the Military Affairs Commission regarding the five post-war measures proposed by Li Du, Deputy Commander of the Northeastern Border Defense Army stationed in Jilin, was previously approved. Among them, regarding the third item, requesting funds for sending dependents to Xinjiang, it was forwarded for verification and handling. Subsequently, a letter was approved and sent to the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, jointly formulating measures, and a letter was sent to the Military Affairs Commission in reply, stating that the situation in Xinjiang has recently been unclear. According to telegrams from Consul Xu in Boli (Khabarovsk) and Sheng Shicai, it seems that the internal organization of Li Du's troops has been reorganized. It would be very inconvenient for these women and children to travel thousands of miles. If the dependents are willing to go to Xinjiang, the central government may provide travel expenses for them to go on their own. Please verify and instruct them to comply, etc. In addition to ordering the Ministry of Military Affairs to forward the instructions for compliance and informing the Ministry of Finance, the Secretariat should record the case and forward it to the original petitioner, etc. A complete copy of the case is enclosed for your information. This is addressed to Li Du, Deputy Commander of the Northeastern Border Defense Army stationed in Jilin. Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan."</p>
<h3 id="e156">Current Situation of Various Armies Stationed in Xinjiang <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>More than 10,000 soldiers of the Northeastern armies under Li Du, Su Bingwen, Wang Delin, etc., who retreated to Russia and went to Xinjiang, still used the army numbers from when they were in Jilin and Heilongjiang. According to Wang Ziyao, adjutant of General Li, recently, personnel from the army departed from Xinjiang and walked for more than 50 days, experiencing many hardships along the way. They arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and reported the current situation of the stationed troops to Generals Li and Wang in Shanghai. He learned that the Northeastern Army in Xinjiang suffered a quarter of casualties during the two political changes in Xinjiang last winter when Dihua was besieged by Ma Zhongying's troops, leaving more than 8,000 people. They have now withdrawn from Dihua, the capital of Xinjiang, and are stationed in seven counties including Ili, Tacheng, Suilai, Usu, Hami, Turpan, and Yanqi. The cost of living is meager, and they are very distressed. They hope that the central military authorities will reorganize them and grant them official status. The local situation in Xinjiang is relatively stable. Zhang Peiyuan, the Border Defense Commissioner of Xinjiang, indeed committed suicide in Ili last November. Ma Zhongying failed to besiege Dihua and retreated to Kashi, southern Xinjiang. He had not heard of the retreat to Russia. Xinjiang is adjacent to Soviet Russia, and the military and commercial influence of Soviet Russia in Xinjiang is very alarming. The Soviet Union has built a railway in Xinjiang (Turkestan-Siberia Railway), which has been completed. The Chinese people should not ignore the issues of national defense and diplomacy in this remote western Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Far East Aircraft Company</p>
<h3 id="e157">Aircraft Performance Postponed <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Due to bad weather, unsuitable for flying, the show will be postponed to Tuesday or Wednesday of this week. The Shanghai Far East Aircraft Company originally scheduled to demonstrate the performance of its newly arrived, latest Hanley Page type two-seater fighter plane at the Hongqiao Airfield at 5:30 PM yesterday. However, due to persistent showers yesterday and the Observatory's warning of a hurricane hitting Shanghai, it was not suitable for flying. For safety reasons, the company temporarily decided to postpone the performance. According to the company authorities, the performance will be postponed to Tuesday or Wednesday of this week. A final decision can be made tomorrow (i.e., today). The news will be announced in Monday's newspapers. Those who have received invitations are requested to retain them for use on the performance date.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Yu Youren Denies Resignation <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>"A time of national crisis is not the time for us to leave," said Xin Sheng News Agency. Yesterday, foreign newspapers reported that Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, had resigned. Yesterday morning, Yu's aides formally denied the report, saying that the resignation rumor was purely due to a misunderstanding caused by the lack of unified language in China. On the morning of the 19th of this month, three reporters visited Yu at the same time. At that time, he happened to want to dispel rumors from outside, so he briefly expressed his recent thoughts. Unexpectedly, due to language issues, a misunderstanding arose. At that time, Yu believed that being an official was not as pleasant as being a commoner. If he were a commoner, he could of course enjoy a leisurely life in the countryside. However, now that he is serving the country and at a time of national crisis, no one can easily shirk his responsibilities for any reason. Therefore, Yu has consistently refused to express any opinion on the twists and turns of this impeachment case by the Control Yuan. This is probably also to consider the future of the country. In short, Yu's words are indeed passive, but he believes that the country is currently in a difficult situation, and it is not the time for people like him to leave, so he has not taken any actual action to resign.</p>
<p>National Postal Workers' Union</p>
<h3 id="e159">Representatives Returning to Shanghai After Petitioning in Beijing <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>"Consolidating the Postal Economic Network Outline," after being submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review multiple times, has now been passed. The date of its promulgation is attracting attention from the outside world. In order to promote the early implementation of this outline, the Shanghai National Postal Workers' Union recently sent Kang Yong as a representative to Beijing to petition. Kang returned to Shanghai by train last night. Kang's purpose in petitioning in Beijing this time was twofold: (1) to request the Ministry of Communications to allow postal workers to attend the Postal Conference to be held on September 1; (2) to request the Legislative Yuan to promulgate the consolidation plan as soon as possible. As a result, the Postal Consolidation Plan still needs to be submitted to the Central Political Conference for review before it can be promulgated. As for the issue of attending the Postal Conference, Zhang Daofan, Vice Minister of Communications, indicated that because the attendees of the conference are all postal directors from various regions, he did not agree to it. It is learned that the National Postal Workers' Union will continue to petition in Beijing to achieve its demands.</p>

<h3 id="e160">After the Labor Dispute is Resolved <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The worker maintenance team is scheduled to withdraw this morning.</p>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, the British American Tobacco factory shutdown dispute has been resolved by the party and government organs through six agreed-upon measures, which have been ordered to be followed by both the union and the company. After receiving the instructions, the Strike Committee immediately convened a temporary meeting for discussion and unanimously agreed to comply. However, there were still one or two minor details regarding the follow-up matters after the resumption of work that needed to be referred to the Municipal Party Committee. Therefore, several representatives, including Liu Dehua and Zhang Ziping, were dispatched to the Municipal Party Committee for instructions yesterday morning. Committee Member Wu Kaixian received them, and after Committee Member Wu explained in detail, the results of the negotiation were quite satisfactory. After reporting back to the committee, a notice was issued, notifying the workers of the resumption of work arrangements. The Da Gong News Agency reporter also crossed the Huangpu River to visit Party Committee Member Chen Junyi. According to Chen, the British American Tobacco factory shutdown dispute has lasted for two months. After repeated mediation by party and government organs, as well as the assistance of community leaders such as Du Yuesheng and the General Labor Union, six resolution measures have now been decided and instructed to both parties. The workers have clearly understood the overall situation and have expressed their compliance. Work can definitely resume next Monday (tomorrow), and all maintenance teams can also withdraw tomorrow morning (i.e., today). Regarding the issuance of relief funds to the new factory workers during the strike period, the authorities are paying close attention to handling it seriously. It is expected to be cleared in the next two days, Saturday and Sunday. At that time, the municipal government, the municipal party committee, and the Social Affairs Bureau will jointly send personnel to handle it. For prudence, the issuance will be based on union registration certificates, factory badges, and other credentials that can prove that they are new factory workers (because some do not have badges). Chiefs and staff from various workshops will also be invited to the venue to verify to avoid fraudulent claims. Chen also said that he had been ordered by the Municipal Party Committee to come to Pudong to persuade the workers for many days, and he felt quite exhausted in spirit. Fortunately, the labor dispute is about to end, and the order during the strike period was good, and no incidents occurred, which is deeply gratifying. He earnestly hoped that both labor and management would not cause more trouble in the future, so that both parties would benefit. It was also learned that after the union maintenance team withdraws this morning, the order at the factory gate will be maintained by the Public Security Bureau dispatching police. Also, fearing that unscrupulous individuals might go to the union to cause trouble, the Public Security Bureau has also dispatched police to the union to protect it since yesterday afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Landlords Voluntarily Reduce Rent <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Disputes over rent for new houses on Shuida Road are also resolved. Since the January 28 Incident and the impact of the global economic downturn, the purchasing power of Shanghai has become weak, and the market has gradually become sluggish. Therefore, various groups have launched a rent reduction campaign to reduce the burden on citizens and revitalize the market. However, landlords also have their own compelling reasons, which often lead to lawsuits over rent reductions. According to a report from a branch of the Rent Reduction Association, the following has recently been resolved: (1) In Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, Public Concession, the landlord, surnamed Chen, from Shaoxing, who owns Hefeng Money Exchange, agreed to collect rent from all tenants in the lane at 80% of the original amount starting from June. There is also a mental hospital in the lane, which, due to its charitable nature, received special preferential treatment from the landlord, with rent collected at 70% of the original amount. (2) The houses on Shuida Road, Jiangwan, were destroyed by artillery fire during the war and have now been rebuilt. However, the rent has increased several times compared to the past. All tenants, including Wansheng Sauce Garden, Liuhexing Store, Tongshun Store, Shunxing Store, Xinmeihua Barber Shop, Yuxingji Store, and Shunlaitai Store, jointly requested the landlord, Wu Mengtan, to reduce the rent to ease their burden. As a result of mediation by party and government organs, the landlord has agreed to pay rent at 60% of the original amount.</p>

<p>Inland Rivers of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces</p>
<h3 id="e165">Unanimously Oppose Inspection by the Ministry of Communications <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Presented to Minister Zhu for temporary suspension of implementation of ship and crew regulations. Since the Ministry of Communications announced the regulations for the inspection of inland river ship crews, the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have unanimously opposed it. Industry associations from the three provinces have appointed the industry associations in Nanjing and Shanghai to draft a request to abolish the inspection of crew members on ships under 50 tons, and to postpone the inspection date for those over 50 tons. The joint presentation is excerpted as follows: "Presented to request a temporary suspension of the implementation of the provisional regulations on the inspection of crew members for vessels navigating inland rivers over 50 gross tons, in order to maintain inland river navigation and protect the livelihoods of existing crew members. It is respectfully reported that the tonnage of all vessels of our member bureaus is mostly between 20 tons and 50 gross tons. This time, your ministry has promulgated and implemented the provisional regulations on the inspection of crew members for vessels under 50 gross tons, which not only fail to meet the actual requirements of inland river ship crew members in performing their duties but also provide no benefit to the safety and security of our inland river shipping businesses. In addition to stating the current situation and requesting abolition in a separate document, it is found that some member bureaus have vessels over 50 gross tons, and they all find the provisional regulations on the inspection of crew members difficult to comply with. The reason is that the above regulations may be applicable to crew members serving on the high seas, but the routes of the vessels over 50 gross tons of our member bureaus are all inland rivers. The scope is narrow, the dangers are few, and the service conditions of the crew members cannot be compared with those of high seas vessels. Moreover, the origins of the existing crew members are the same as those of the crew members of vessels between 20 gross tons and 50 gross tons. They all rise gradually and do not advance by jumping levels. They not only have considerable experience in navigation knowledge and practical skills, but also have a tacit understanding of the current routes. In terms of physical condition, they are all healthy, and in terms of service, they are all competent. Good and old skippers hold the power of the life of a ship. When the owners are in charge of employing people, how can they not pay attention to it? In the labor side, there is no way to get a job if you are incompetent. It is also difficult to blame the failure of navigation entirely on the lack of service. In short, inspecting crew members and focusing on practical skills are the most urgent tasks. You must not overemphasize literal meaning and neglect practical experience. If it is said that holding a piece of certificate can determine that they must be competent, it is difficult to believe deeply. I humbly believe that the law is nothing more than human sentiment. Our navigation authorities should, in this time of decline in inland river navigation and extreme difficulty in the lives of existing crew members, urgently maintain the status quo, so that the survival relationship between labor and management can also be maintained, and the hard work of our inland river merchants can be salvaged in the future. Our associations believe that this matter concerns the business of inland river merchants and the livelihoods of existing crew members, which is of utmost importance. We venture to submit this joint document, hoping that the authorities will grant approval and carefully examine and approve the temporary suspension of the implementation of the provisional regulations on the inspection of crew members for vessels navigating inland rivers over 50 gross tons in order to maintain inland river navigation and protect the livelihoods of existing crew members. With great urgency and anticipation, we respectfully present this to Zhu, Minister of Communications. Nanjing Shipping Association, (Chief drafter) Shanghai Inland River Ship Industry Association, Zhenjiang Shipping Association, Wuhu Small Ship Industry Association, Hangzhou Ship Industry Association, Wuxian Ship Association, Wuxi County Shipping Association, Wuxing County Ship Industry Association, Pinghu County Ship Industry Association, trade unions."</p>

<p>This time, the municipal government issued municipal construction bonds, and buyers were enthusiastic, selling out instantly. A reporter from the Guo Wen News Agency learned from various parties about the investment of the banking community and other construction conditions as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e167">Construction of Qiujiang Wharf <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Central Bank has purchased hundreds of acres of land along the Qiujiang Estuary to prepare for the construction of wharves and warehouses. In the future, imported goods destined for the interior will not need to detour through the concessions. The area also connects to the Beijing-Shanghai Line, and an agreement has been reached with the railway bureau, which will be realized soon.</p>

<p>The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company has buried a 36-inch large water pipe in the district, and the underground branch pipes in various roads in the district have also been laid. Recently, it purchased land in the district to build an office and a large substation, which has begun construction and will be completed soon. The central district telephone branch bureau has also completed most of the project since its construction in May.</p>
<h3 id="e169">New Houses in Short Supply <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Since the Xingye Trust Company built new houses in the district for sale, they have been sold out (which was unexpected, mostly residents have) moved in and are extremely satisfied with the fresh air and complete facilities. The houses built by the China and Shanghai Banks will also be completed soon. Two-thirds of the houses built by Xinhua Bank in the vicinity of the district have been reserved. It is heard that Minghua, Tonghe, and Pudong Yongheng Banks are also carrying out construction plans.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Land Prices Rising Step by Step in the District <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The China Peasant and Labor Bank has purchased a large number of land in the district to prepare for the construction of staff dormitories. In the most recent transaction, a landlord, Mr. Chen, sold several acres of residential land for 6,000 yuan per mu. The Bank of China sold ten acres of residential land for 5,400 yuan per mu. Recently, overseas Chinese and several banks have been looking for land in the area but have not yet been successful. The current land price is more than double the price of the land acquisition, and the demand from all walks of life is strong and supply is short. In the future, the land price may rise step by step to the level of 10,000 yuan per mu, which is also unpredictable.</p>
<p>Special District Rickshaw Industry Association</p>
<h3 id="e171">Please Negotiate for the Abolition of the Vehicle Committee <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, since the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession established the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, all vehicle owners and rickshaw pullers have expressed their opposition to its impractical measures. Yesterday, the Special District Rickshaw Industry Association submitted petitions to the municipal government, the municipal party committee, the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Bureau of Social Affairs, requesting negotiations to abolish the organization of the committee. The original text reads: "Presented to request assistance in negotiating the use of concession rights to organize and implement forced oppression on more than 100,000 people in the rickshaw industry, leaving rickshaw pullers waiting to die. Since the industry began, it has been in operation for many years. There are more than 1,000 vehicle owners and more than 100,000 rickshaw pullers, all of whom are working day and night to support their lives. The tax responsibilities they bear are also quite heavy. The total amount of Chinese, British and French donations and license fees each year is more than 600,000 yuan. This kind of business can be said to be a great contribution to the propertyless poor. If not for the tolerance of our industry, society would have had a few more unemployed people. From this, it can be seen that the rickshaw industry is actually a profit-generating machine, and all government offices should protect it, how can they destroy it? How would we know the facts prove that it is just the opposite. Ever since the Zhabei Incident in 1932, Chinese and foreign businesses have been stagnated, and the various rickshaw industries have suffered the most due to traffic congestion, and have been almost unable to recover. Fortunately, the vehicle owners have worked hard to fight and maintain it in every possible way. In the current economic downturn, there is finally a glimmer of dawn and a slight sign of prosperity. Unexpectedly, this has agitated the jealousy of imperialism. In addition, unscrupulous elements have assisted and cheered from the sidelines, either wanting to take it over for public ownership or thinking about increasing taxes. Various strategies are nothing more than pleasing foreigners, but fearing that it would conflict with the Yangjingbang regulations, they cleverly created a name and established the Rickshaw Affairs Management Committee to manage rickshaw affairs. Since its establishment, the committee has been able to oppress vehicle merchants. Today, it is cracking down on vehicle parts and replacing vehicle shells. Tomorrow, it is registering rickshaw pullers and increasing monthly donations, breaking up vehicle merchant groups, and alienating both sides. Vehicle merchants cannot do business with peace of mind, and vehicle renters and rickshaw pullers are all in danger. The undercurrent of the market is frightening, and the atmosphere is extremely tense. Our industry has witnessed the situation and is deeply worried. If the committee is obsessed and does not wake up, it will inevitably create a special opportunity and be used by the Communist Party, and the future will be dire. Our department has repeatedly argued with reason, painfully stated the advantages and disadvantages, and issued declarations twice. We have also listed in detail the committee's unrealistic and inhumane suggestions, and have run around calling for help, with sore lips and dry tongues, but the committee has turned a deaf ear and continued to act arbitrarily. At present, the committee is becoming even more aggravated. It has summoned vehicle merchants for talks, and starting from August 1, it will increase the monthly donation by $1.50 per rickshaw as the committee's regular operating expenses and half as a mutual aid business. Finally, it issued a serious tone, saying that if vehicle merchants have any resistance, the committee will have its own ways to deal with it. At that time, it may ask the authorities to punish or reassign the vehicle license to a new car dealership. This kind of measure by the committee is simply insane and unreasonable. At a time when rural areas are bankrupt, the economy is collapsing, and disaster has struck both sides of the Yangtze River, many famine-stricken farmers from various counties have come to this port to pull rickshaws for food. In addition, the number of original rickshaw pullers is really shocking. At this time of trouble, those who hold this political power should be cautious, calm, and maintain the status quo in order to cope with the special crisis. Who knows that the committee is taking advantage of this extraordinary time to arbitrarily change the rules, overthrow the old cases, arouse outside doubts, and stir up the rickshaw industry trend. If there is any improper handling, it will inevitably lead to a great tragedy. At that time, at least it will harm the city's public security, and at worst, it will affect international negotiations. Our industry has seen and heard this, how can we be silent? We hereby state the whole process of the committee's extortion and the uneasy phenomenon of vehicle owners and rickshaw pullers, and appeal to your government, meeting, bureau and office for examination and approval. You must uphold justice, negotiate strictly, and send a letter to the British Municipal Council, immediately abolishing the illegal rickshaw affairs management committee and still being controlled by the former vehicle affairs office, so as to eliminate hidden dangers and secure livelihoods. We cannot help but to lead and wait for orders."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Religious Society Alliance, due to the prolonged drought and the resulting calamities, had previously issued two notices to its members, instructing each public hall to lead its followers in setting up altars to pray for rain. Subsequently, starting from the 15th of July, it convened leaders of various groups to hold a general prayer meeting at the society's headquarters for three days. On the final day, they were delighted to receive blessed rain. However, as the rain was not torrential and the withered seedlings were not yet revived, they instructed their members to continue praying for rain until the farmland could be planted. Fortunately, days of continuous rain have since fallen, and the weather has cooled. Yesterday, the society notified its members that the ceremony had been concluded and that further prayers were unnecessary.</p>

<p>The Independent Christian Church was founded at the end of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, and is now nearly thirty years old. In the past, it opposed foreign missionaries to avoid the suspicion of cultural aggression, and raised the banner of church independence, hoping to achieve complete self-support and self-propagation, in order to gradually recover the rights of the church. For this reason, the church has developed rapidly, and now has branches all over the country and abroad. It is learned that the late elder Chen Weixin served the church during his lifetime, and was very diligent. To commemorate Chen's past contributions, in addition to raising a Chen memorial fund and publishing a special memorial issue, a death anniversary memorial service will be held today (22nd) at 2:30 PM at the general church on Xiangyin Road, Jiangwan. Special cars are provided to pick up and drop off guests at the Sidali office. It is expected that there will be a grand event at that time.</p>

<p>Chinese national Wang Shijie, who studied in Lyon, France, has returned to China. In view of the high price of the original neon electric glass tubes, he has invented the Jingxia electric advertisement to save electricity costs. The electrical device is installed inside a box, which can be large or small. (The installation method is patented and cannot be disclosed.) The characters and various trademarks and drawings outside the box are very bright and do not harm the eyes. It is brighter and more economical than the original neon electric glass tubes. It is said that Nanyang Hospital and other businesses in this city have installed it. The distribution office is located at No. 55 Hengmao Lane, Avenue Foch, French Concession.</p>

<p>The Railway Bureau previously considered that the railway transport of chemical products was mostly for school experiments, so the amount transported was at most a few pounds of each type, and there was rarely a large batch transport. It seemed that it could not be charged according to the second-class minimum freight rate. It was specially requested from the Ministry of Railways that chemical products with explosive or dangerous properties used by school laboratories should be allowed to change the provision that the minimum freight should be calculated according to the second-class rate, in order to negotiate the situation. Subsequently, the Ministry ordered (Industry Letter No. 25653) to allow new regulations. The freight for chemical products transported by formal schools may be calculated according to the minimum freight for less-than-carload freight, starting at 50 kilograms. The Railway Bureau is now announcing the implementation from July 1st. However, it is stipulated that in the future, if any station transports chemical products with dangerous properties, one of the consignors and consignees must be a formal school, and must provide a formal letter of certification from the school. This certificate letter should be submitted along with the freight ticket to the accounting office for verification, otherwise the second-class minimum fee will still be charged.</p>

The debate has ended and sentencing is scheduled for the 23rd (i.e., tomorrow). The details have been reported in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, at about 3 PM yesterday, the police suddenly summoned Yan for investigation again, and he did not leave until about an hour and a half later. It is said that this second summons of Yan for investigation was because of the suspicion that Yan had initially attempted to extort 60,000 yuan from the families of the first defendant Zhang Zuming and the second defendant Zhuang Jimeng, but failed.</p>

The two bodies were sent to the Philomene Road morgue by the Huishi police. At about 10 AM, Prosecutor Zhang Junqing, dispatched by the First Special District Local Court, accompanied forensic doctor Zhang Yan, clerk Wang Zuyi, etc. to the morgue to verify the bodies. Yuan Xiaoquan testified that he was the second landlord of No. 158 North Fujian Road and that the deceased Yuan Ma was his wife. He had told the main landlord about the insecurity of the house a month ago and asked him to repair it, but he only sent someone to slightly repair the facade, but not the walls. Yesterday, it suddenly collapsed, etc. Wang Achang, a worker from Shaoxing, testified that he rented a house at No. 158 and that the deceased Wang Chen was his wife. He was working outside when the wall collapsed yesterday, so he did not know about it at the time. After obtaining the testimony, Zhang Jun ordered that the deceased Yuan Ma and Wang Chen were both killed by being crushed. Yuan Ma's body was handed over to Yuan Xiaoquan and Wang Chen's body was handed over to Wang Achang, who signed the certificates separately and took them back for burial.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the second day of praying for rain and disaster relief. The meeting was originally scheduled to have Celestial Master Zhang Ruiling submit a memorial to Heaven at 5 AM yesterday (Mao Zheng), but because it was raining heavily at that time, it could not be held. It was changed to today (still Mao Zheng). At 3 PM yesterday, Celestial Master Zhang Ruiling, accompanied by Wang Yiting, Shao Ruxin, Lou Ziyun, Qinghai He Shang, and other philanthropists, went to the Dragon King Temple at Dananmen to pay respects to the Dragon King, burn talismans, and pray for driving the clouds and making rain.

<p>The text of the memorial, which was changed to be submitted this morning due to the rain yesterday, is extracted as follows: "On July 21st of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, that is, the tenth day of the sixth month of the Jiaxu year in the Xiazheng calendar, Buddhist disciples Wang Zhen, Xu Guannan, Shao Ruxin, etc., after fasting and bathing, respectfully offer incense with utmost sincerity, and piously knock on the throne of the Jade Emperor, and Chen Ci Ri: 'The country takes the people as its foundation, and the people take food as their heaven. The Chinese people have long been covered and nurtured, and have been born together. I never thought that since the beginning of summer this year, the drought demon has wreaked havoc, and the rain master has lost his job, resulting in rivers drying up, farmland cracking, red land for thousands of miles, and heat increasing sharply. The autumn harvest is therefore hopeless, and epidemics are born from it. Since the great flood in various provinces in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the afflicted people have not been able to breathe steadily for three years amid internal troubles and foreign disasters. Now, they are suffering from drought, living in deep water and hot fire, and the lives of the people are like silk threads. Disasters are circulating, and there is no way to appeal. I think that heaven has the virtue of loving life, and Buddhism values the merit of saving the dead. Even the slightest of ants are cherished, and the violence of tigers and wolves is not punished. Therefore, we unite with the Buddhist and Taoist religions, philanthropists, and devout women, and pray sincerely to plead for the drought-stricken areas in various provinces and cities across the country. I respectfully ask the emperor to show his judgment, and pour down sweet rain to eliminate disasters, so that the people can live in peace and the country can be prosperous, the times can be harmonious, and the years can be abundant. I have laid bare my report and feel extremely frightened and worried.' Sincerely, the report."</p>

Celestial Master Zhang Ruiling has scheduled to burn talismans, retreat the gods, and descend from the altar at 5 PM this afternoon. The merits of praying will be completed by this time.</p>
<p>Details have been seen in the previous report. It is now learned that the Nanhui County government dispatched Wang Dongsheng, the director of the county's Public Security Bureau, to the Zhangjiang Gate with inspectors and police chiefs on the 19th to verify the scene of the incident. It was verified that the bandit Zhu Alan was indeed killed by stray bullets during his lifetime. It was also heard that Zhu Shaoqing, who was captured continuously, had been interrogated in advance by the Public Security Bureau and confessed to the kidnapping of Chen Deyi and other cases committed by his brother Zhu Alan and himself in the past. Regarding the plot to launch an uprising, he only said that someone had asked him to explore the strength of the Zhangjiang Gate Defense Corps, etc., and the rest was evasive and cunning, and he refused to tell the truth. It is also learned that the district bureau and group have telegraphed the county government to send police to the gate to pick up the prisoners, so as to avoid any unforeseen circumstances. It is also heard that the Pudong Hometown Association believes that this matter is of great concern to local public security, so it has sent a letter to the Nanhui County Government, requesting that the captured criminals be severely punished and the remaining parties be arrested in order to curb the source of chaos.</p>

<p>Yang Fuhai Detained Pending Investigation - Yang Fuhai, a resident of Pudong Gaojia, his wife Yang Xiao suffered from severe toothache on the night of the 16th of this month. Yang Fuhai took the medicine powder and asked her to swallow it. (Yang is a Chinese medicine doctor and also practices surgery, so he has various medicines at home.) Unexpectedly, after taking the medicine, she shouted in pain, asking her husband if he had taken the wrong medicine powder, causing her intestines to feel like they were being cut with a knife. Yang also admitted that he might have taken the wrong medicine powder. He was at a loss and did not have time to treat her. Xiao died of exhaustion until dawn. The local defense corps detained Yang Fuhai and sent him to the Fourth District Police Station for interrogation, and reported to the local court to send someone to verify the truth. The body was sent to Zhenru for autopsy. Yesterday, Yang Fuhai was sent by the Fourth District Police Station to the Third Section and sent to the local court for interrogation. After the prosecutor's inquiry, he was ordered to be detained pending investigation.</p>
<p>On the Third-Floor Mezzanine</p>
<h3 id="e191">Fifteen Bags of Red Pills Seized <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Suspicious Small Girl Named as Defendant Along With Woman - Detective Wang Chenying and Detective Wang Guangtian of the Jiaxing Road Police Station learned that someone was selling drugs for profit in the house at No. 37 Hongye Fang, Wuzhou Road. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, they cooperated with Chinese and foreign police to search the house. They saw local woman Chen Yao and others gathering to play mahjong there, but no red pills were found. Strangely, they later found out that the pills were hidden at No. 35 next door, on the third-floor mezzanine. They went to that building and copied 15 bags of red pills weighing 123 and a half taels. They asked the second landlord, Yong woman Zhu Caixiang, and learned that Chen Yao had rented the building and moved in on the 29th of last month. Only a small girl came to stay every night, and the rent was 4 yuan and a half per month, but she did not know that red pills were hidden. She lived in the front building of No. 37. The detectives went to check the front building and found a white crepe cloth, green buttoned shirt. Its size was no different from what Chen Yao was wearing. They arrested her and took her and the red pills to the police station. The head of the detectives ordered her to be sent to the women's prison. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Public Works Bureau stated the previous situation and said that the defendant denied it at the police station. He now filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law and requested a postponement for detailed investigation. He then presented the red pills and a shirt for inspection. Zhu Caixiang, the second landlord of No. 35, proved the process and pointed out that the girl who came to sleep every night was listening to the court. Attorney Li asked the detectives to put the girl in the witness box. She claimed to live upstairs at No. 350 Dayou Lane, Wuzhou Road. Her name was Wang Zhaodi, 15 years old, from Nanjing. She knew the defendant because she lived downstairs and I often went to a certain woman in the front building of No. 35 to hang out and watch her play mahjong. She did not know about the red pills hidden in the third-floor mezzanine, and had not stayed in that mezzanine. When asked of the defendant, she completely denied it, saying that she had lived with her mother at No. 250 Dayou Lane for many years since her husband died when she was 19 years old. The red pills copied from the mezzanine belonged to someone else. The rest of her testimony was evasive. Attorney Li asked to detain the girl Zhaodi and add her to the defendant's position, as the girl was highly suspicious. Judge Wu Zehan approved and ordered Wang Zhaodi to be temporarily detained to investigate and handle whether she was an accomplice. Chen Yao was taken back to prison and the hearing was rescheduled.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Neli, the world's fattest woman, weighing over seven hundred pounds, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (20th) on the President Cleveland from Japan.

Although the woman is fat, her appetite is the same as that of ordinary people, but she is very healthy and has never been ill for a day. Two years ago, a famous doctor in Los Angeles examined her body. Before the examination, he expected that she would not live to be 35 years old, but after the examination, he said that she could reach old age. In addition to doing gentle gymnastics every day, the woman walks for a short time. Her upper arm circumference is 26 inches, her knees are 36 inches, her thighs are 48 inches, and her waist circumference is 64 inches. However, her feet are only 5 and a half inches long, and her hands are not big either. This is the woman's first time arriving in Shanghai.

<p>Demon? He Shou Wu? - Jiang Gengfu, the 16-year-old son of Jiang Agen, a farmer in Xingtangwu, north of Minhang Town in the southwest of this city, went to cut grass near Longyin Temple the day before yesterday afternoon. Suddenly, he saw a pair of human-like figures jumping out of a stone box (i.e., an ancient tomb). The larger one was about five inches long and the smaller one was only three inches long. They ran back and forth in the field. Gengfu was very surprised to see this monster. For a moment, his curiosity was aroused and he reached out to catch them. Unexpectedly, the two little people noticed it and ran forward. However, they jumped very fast and were not easy to capture. Gengfu chased after them, but accidentally stepped on the smaller one and killed it. The larger one escaped. Later, he picked it up and looked at it. It had all the five senses and four limbs, and it was male. So he took it home. For a time, those who went to watch filled the body frame. Later, Shen Shanshan of the Minhang Town Releasing Bureau learned of it and spent money to buy it for reference. According to general superstitious people, this is a monster that takes thousands of years to cultivate into a human form, or it is said to be a transformation of He Shou Wu. The arguments are divided and there is no consensus.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Organizing the Xi'an National Goods Company <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The Northwest National Goods Exhibition Group, sponsored by the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperative Association, has successively held exhibitions in Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and other three places. It was warmly welcomed by all sectors of the local community and achieved remarkable results. Recently, it was heard that the Xi'an exhibition is scheduled to open on the 20th of this month. The venue is located in the People's Education Center, which is located south of the Bell Tower and is a bustling central location. It is surrounded by gardens and planted with trees, with excellent scenery. The exhibition venue is in the corridor at the south end of the entrance, with eleven rooms arranged. The central square pavilion has four rooms arranged, and the large auditorium at the north end has twenty-five rooms arranged. Each room occupies a four-meter square space, and the entrance and exit are extremely wide. It was jointly inspected and reserved by Director Lei Jian of the Provincial Department and the nine chairmen designated by the Chamber of Commerce, along with Xu Jianruo, a representative from Shanghai. It is also heard that Chairman Shao of the Provincial Government, Director Yang of the Pacification Headquarters, and all parties, government, military, police, academic, and business circles are enthusiastically participating, so the opening day will be exceptionally lively. However, Chairman Shao believes that the Xi'an Provincial Government is the center of the Northwest, and goods purchased from Lanzhou, Ningxia, and northern Sichuan must be transported to Xi'an for sale. Although the national goods exhibition can give local people a considerable understanding, it is a pity that it is only temporary and the effect is not significant. It is necessary to establish a Xi'an China National Goods Company before the finest national products from all over the country can be gathered and compete with foreign goods. This matter has been discussed repeatedly with Representative Xu, so after Mr. Xu returned to Shanghai, he conveyed this idea. Shanghai is very supportive of Chairman Shao's proposal. Therefore, Du Chongyuan was specially invited to go to the west, partly to attend the opening ceremony of the National Goods Exhibition, and partly to discuss with all sectors of Xi'an the methods for establishing a National Goods Company. Recently, a telegram was received stating that the company's capital is planned to be 30,000 yuan in national currency, which can be established.</p>
<p>Insufficient Rainfall</p>
<h3 id="e199">Inland River Steamer Schedules Not Yet Restored <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>However, the weather has turned cooler and melon crops have been greatly affected. Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the weather in this city has gradually become cooler since the rainfall, but the water volume is not large, so inland river steamers have not been able to operate as usual. Melon crops have been greatly reduced in price due to the cooler weather. Recently, the lower-level offices on the Huangpu Bund are concerned about typhoons hitting Shanghai and the possibility of the Huangpu River overflowing, and are carrying out defensive work. The following is a report from the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter after investigation:</p>
<h3 id="e200">Schedules Not Restored <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>The schedules of small steamers of the Inland River Steamer Bureau to Suzhou, Wuxi, Kunshan, Changshu, Hangzhou, Shengze, Huzhou, Xiashi, and other places have been suspended for a long time due to drought and water depletion on the Shanghai-Xiashi line and the Shanghai-Huzhou line. The Shanghai-Xiashi line now operates to Pinghu, and the Shanghai-Huzhou line operates to Nanxun. The remaining lines are temporarily maintained by ships with smaller tonnage. Although there has been rain recently, the water volume is too small and the time is too short, so the water level in the river has risen very little and is still not smooth. According to the China Merchants Inland River Steamer Bureau, if it rains for a few more days and the water level can rise by three to five inches, ships in various inland rivers can travel smoothly without obstruction and restore their schedules.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Melon Prices Depreciate <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The weather was extremely hot a week ago. In this city, there was a general lack of watermelons and various melons in the markets. Therefore, the villagers from various places who came to Shanghai to sell melons early all left with good prices. Hearing that watermelons in Shanghai could be sold at good prices, farmers from various places transported them to Shanghai in large quantities by agreement. However, after arriving in Shanghai, it rained and the weather turned cooler. What could be sold for three or four yuan a load before is now only one yuan and two jiao per load, all of which are top-quality white watermelons and potato melons. Therefore, they are all dejected and lament their bad luck. The prices of various vegetables are also slightly cheaper than in the past.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Defensive Works <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The weather has been cloudy and rainy recently. According to the report of the Observatory, there is a possibility of a typhoon hitting Shanghai. Yesterday, the water in the Huangpu River also rose greatly due to weather conditions. Those with lower-level offices along the Huangpu Bund Road, in view of the previous incident where the river water rushed onto the road due to a typhoon, causing the offices to be flooded and endangering various items, have hired workers to rush to build defenses in preparation, so as not to repeat the previous mistakes.</p>

Considering the current situation of rural bankruptcy and the withering of all industries, it is really unbearable. How to deal with it, please discuss and decide. A letter will be sent to the customs brokers to negotiate with the shipping companies that the water freight for Shanghai and Fujian goods should still be calculated at the original price in kilograms, so as to avoid increasing it to avoid disputes. The meeting adjourned at about 6 pm.</p>

<p>Gu Gao, a local woman, and her son Yongkang opened the Yiji Meat Shop at No. 196 Qichang Warehouse Street, Pudong for many years. In order to reduce electricity bills, they cut the outer wire of the electricity meter and stole electricity. On the 7th of last month, they were discovered by the inspectors of the Pudong Electric Company. They immediately reported to the police officer Lin Xiqi to prove it. Because Gu Gao and others firmly denied stealing electricity and falsely accused the company's employees of cutting it and framing them, they reported to the Third District Office of the Public Security Bureau to send Cai Zanzhou to stick a seal on the broken cable. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau was also asked to inspect and confirm that the wire had been damaged for a long time and there was a possibility of stealing electricity. The company had to strictly punish it because it was a matter of damaging public utilities. On the 18th of last month, it filed a complaint with the Shanghai District Court to investigate and deal with it according to law, and attached a private prosecution, requesting a judgment to recover the electricity bill. After investigation by the prosecutor, it was recognized that the defendants had committed the crime of Article 337, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and filed a public prosecution. After trial by the judge, the verdict was pronounced on the 19th of this month. Gu Yongkang and Gu Gao were jointly and continuously fined 50 yuan each for theft. If the fine is enforced and not paid, one day of imprisonment will be imposed for each yuan. Gu Yongkang and Gu Gao shall jointly compensate the Pudong Electric Company for the loss of 293 yuan and 24 cents in ocean.</p>

<p>Xia Hua, an old woman from Ningbo, is 58 years old and lives at No. 38, Lane 595, Dongyouheng Road. She has four sons, only the second son Yutian makes a small business and supports her. But the income is very small, so she can barely make a living on weekdays. However, Yutian suddenly left and did not return three or four days ago, causing her to feel the danger of lack of food at home. A few days ago, she was resentful about this and suddenly had the idea of ending her life. She secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. Later, Li Shuyuan, who lived with her, discovered it and immediately took her to Shanghai Nursing Home for treatment, but it was ineffective and she died soon. The hospital reported to the Jiaxing Road Police Department, and detective Zhao Lianbi was ordered to investigate and find her son Yutian, and the body was taken to the autopsy room on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, he reported to the First Special Court, and prosecutor Zhang visited the office to examine the body. According to Xia Yutian, he is 29 years old and usually makes a small business to make a living. In the past three or four days, he had nothing to do, so he was not at home. He didn't know why his mother committed suicide by poisoning, etc. According to Li Shuyi, Zhang Jun ordered that the deceased Xia Hua, female, did commit suicide by poisoning before her death. The body was handed over to her son Xia Yutian to receive the coffin.</p>

<p>Leprosy is prevalent in our country, but effective treatments are scarce. Therefore, once someone is afflicted with leprosy, it is often deemed incurable, causing extreme fear and anxiety. However, the issue is often the medicine not being suited to the ailment, rather than the disease being untreatable. Mr. Zhang Jianyu of Huai'an is a kind and compassionate man well-versed in medicine. He has developed a type of cocklebur paste that is deeply effective in treating leprosy. Fearing the inconvenience of long-distance purchases and shipments, he has made the formula and preparation method publicly available, allowing patients to prepare and make it themselves. If they entrust him to prepare it on their behalf, the price is also reasonable, unlike typical profit-seeking individuals. If impoverished patients are unable to afford the medicine, they can send Mr. Zhang a letter detailing their condition, and he will find a way to donate it to them. He is truly a benefactor of humanity.</p>

<p>To the Editor, I read in your newspaper's local news section on the 17th about the arrest of suspects in the red pill case on Xinmin Road, which stated that Chen Laosi was also detained. However, my original name is Chen Yonglin, the fourth child in my family. I have been running the Chen Sen Tai shoe last shop on Xinmin Road for many years, and I have always been law-abiding. On June 10th of this year, I was also elected as a standing committee member of the Shoe Leather Nail Last Trade Association. Qian Baocheng was an apprentice in my shop in 1922, learning the craft. He completed his apprenticeship long ago and has since opened his own Shi Tai shoe last shop. Yonglin and Baocheng have long since been separated. This time, Baocheng was detained because of the red pill case, which has nothing to do with Yonglin. I am writing this special letter to request a correction, for which I would be extremely grateful. Chen Yonglin respectfully bows again, July 21.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Chief Editor, Greetings. In the local news section of your newspaper on the 19th of this month, there was a news item about the abbot of Dizang Temple, Monk Huilun, being fined for smoking. The facts are not entirely accurate. Our abbot is Zhen Dian and Huilun (also known as Kuanyang) originally resided at the Shangyuan Temple on Mount Jiuhua. He came to Shanghai for business and is staying temporarily at our temple, not as the abbot of our temple. This matter concerns the reputation of our temple. Therefore, we are writing to clarify and request that your newspaper publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section to make a correction, for which we would be most grateful. With best wishes for your well-being, respectfully submitted by the Accounting Department of Dizang Temple, July 21. To the Esteemed Chief Editor of Shen Bao, Greetings. I was delighted to read the news about our delegation's arrival in Shanghai in your newspaper on the 20th of this month. However, the scope of our delegation is very limited. It was organized in accordance with the regulations of the Central Propaganda Committee and has a registered membership. There are a total of fifteen members, all of whom work with the delegation in various locations. There are no delegation members remaining behind. We are concerned that those unaware of the true situation may have doubts or that other improper activities may occur under our name. For the sake of prudence, our delegation respectfully requests that your newspaper publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section. We would be most grateful. With best wishes for your writing, Chen Zhenglong, July 21.</p>

<p>|| Reply to Xu Lezhen and Du Luoji ||</p>
<p>Many readers have raised various questions after reading Li Da's translation of "A Course in Materialist Philosophy." We have received three to four hundred questions about this book. Some of these questions are very simple, and we have answered them individually. However, there are also many important questions that we will continue to answer publicly from today onwards. Some of these questions arise because the translation is obscure and difficult for readers to understand. Others are due to typesetting errors. Still others are due to the translator's failure to understand the original meaning and translating it incorrectly. This last point is something we must pay special attention to, because translations in China are generally unreliable. It is inconvenient for readers without careful review, and the review work is also one of the most important things we need to do.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Mr. Xu Zhuzhen asks: <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>1. "Idealist philosophy likes to fight materialism the most, showing that it has become independent from religion." Judging from the preceding sentences, the last sentence here should probably be "showing that it has merged with religion."</p>
<p>Answer: The sentence "Idealist philosophy likes to fight materialism the most..." has been translated incorrectly. The original sentence should be translated as "In order to be able to more effectively fight against materialism, idealist philosophy sometimes pretends to be independent from religion."</p>
<p>2. "But even when based on previously exaggerated scientific propositions, philosophy cannot but pander to religion." This sentence is incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Answer: The sentence "But even when based on one-sided and exaggerated scientific propositions, philosophy cannot but pander to religion" means that idealist philosophers sometimes have to use scientific propositions as their own evidence in order to pretend to be independent of religion. However, the scientific propositions they use are not complete, because in order to suit their needs, they only exaggerate one aspect of the propositions. And in this case, they are still flattering religion and are not really independent.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Mr. Du Luoji asks: <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>1. "Marx in the war era of 1804 to 76..." 1804 must be wrong, please correct it.</p>
<p>Answer: 1804 is a typographical error and should be corrected to 1854.</p>
<p>2. "Qualitative movement, that is, each stage of development, has characteristics that cannot be explained by the laws of development of the previous stage" is completely incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Answer: The development of things must go through many stages, and each stage has its own characteristics. For example, a person must go through the stages of infancy, youth, and middle age from birth to death. At each new stage, this person's character is different from the previous stage. The character of a young person is certainly different from that of an infant. The character of a young person has many new things added compared to an infant. Therefore, the characteristics of the youth stage cannot be explained by the characteristics (or laws of development) of its previous stage (i.e., infancy). Changes in character are qualitative movements.</p>
<p>3. "The will of human beings who are critically thinking" What does this mean? Answer: It means "to think about the will of human beings with a critical attitude." The Populists did not know that the development of society has its own material laws and believed that the future of society could be controlled by the will of human beings. However, this will is not blind, but can only be decided after careful thought and consideration. This will, which has undergone careful thought, is the "will of critical thinking." Of course, the Populists believe that thought and will can control social history, which is a kind of idealistic view of history and is wrong.</p>
<p>4. In the fourth line of the item "Something that is exaggerated in one aspect becomes a fetish and an idol," what does the word "it" refer to? It is best to explain these four lines in detail.</p>
<p>Answer: The two "it" in the seventh line refer to "one aspect" of each aspect.</p>
<p>The "it" in the ninth line refers to "other aspects" besides the aspect in question.</p>
<p>Everything has many aspects. For example, a person generally has physical, mental, and character aspects. In terms of a person's life, infancy, youth, adulthood, and old age are manifestations of the many aspects of a person's development. Since things are multifaceted, each aspect only occupies a part of the importance in that thing and cannot represent the whole of that thing. A person who dies in infancy cannot be considered a complete person. Since each aspect of things cannot become the whole, if we exaggerate one aspect of each aspect, regard this aspect as overly important, and ignore other aspects, so that the other aspects are obscured beneath it and are controlled by it, and we regard it as self-sufficient and independent, and we regard it as an idol, even though it is objectively not that important, but we insist on seeing it as that important, then our meaning cannot be correctly reflected for it, but is a distorted and erroneous reflection. Idealism is the result of exaggerating one aspect of thought. Therefore, idealism is incorrect.</p>

<p>1.  Administrative personnel responsible for the school also concurrently hold positions elsewhere, and almost all the faculty are also part-time. This is inappropriate and should be corrected immediately, and full-time faculty and staff should be rehired.</p>
<p>2.  The school's graduate school has regulations for master's and doctoral degrees. Before the degree law is promulgated, this provision should be abolished.</p>
<p>3.  The evening class is tentatively allowed to continue, but only one enrollment is allowed in the fall each year. The number of enrollments should follow the quota ratio of Category A and B schools stipulated in the Ministry's order. The class time should be advanced and the remedial military training plan should be submitted to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>(2) School of Arts and Sciences: The school has been established for a long time and is roughly in scale. All of the measure are still be able to be followed. The biology department has achieved better results with complete equipment. However, the following points should still be improved.</p>
<p>1.  The school regulations stipulate that "students who complete a two-year program in the liberal arts can transfer to Nanjing Jinling Theological Seminary for three years, and the school will grant a Bachelor of Arts degree." Jinling Theological Seminary has not been approved by the Ministry for registration. This regulation is inconsistent with the Ministry's regulations and should be terminated immediately. In addition, the pre-medical science department has been cancelled by the Ministry's order and should be discontinued immediately. The original students should be incorporated into the science departments. In addition, the school's regulations on master's degrees have no basis before the degree law is promulgated and should be deleted. 2.  The equipment of the physics department of the school of science and engineering urgently needs to be supplemented and faculty should also be added to facilitate teaching.</p>
<p>2.  The school and the affiliated middle school are in the same location, which is inconvenient for teaching and training. The affiliated middle school should be separated. The Ministry has already ordered restrictions on the direct admission of graduates of the affiliated middle school to the university. In the future, the school's enrollment should be strictly enforced. Graduates of the affiliated middle school should participate in the entrance examination like graduates of other schools to comply with the law.</p>
<p>3.  Special attention should be paid to student training. The accumulated habits of luxury and frivolity must be eliminated as much as possible to make them advocate frugality and tend to the path of academic research.</p>

<p>The founder of the school raised funds to run the school and experienced many difficulties, which shows his enthusiasm. However, there are still many shortcomings in the school's operation. The areas that should be improved are listed on the left.</p>
<p>(1) The school's evening classes were previously ordered to be phased out over the years and should be followed immediately. No more enrollment should be made.</p>
<p>(2) The Department of Law should merge the two departments of political science and economics into a Department of Political Economics from the next academic year.</p>
<p>(3) The total number of students enrolled this year should not exceed 120. The school's past enrollment has been too lenient. In the future, the qualifications of new students should be carefully reviewed and the entrance examination should be strictly enforced.</p>
<p>(4) The work of the two offices of academic affairs and administration is slack. Various statistical forms are missing. They should be thoroughly rectified, administrative reforms should be carried out, and economic transparency should be implemented.</p>
<p>(5) Students at the school are often absent from class. Teachers' leave reached 117 hours in March and April, which is inappropriate. In the future, student absenteeism should be curbed, and teacher absenteeism must be restricted to emphasize academic work. The responsible personnel should check and deal with students whether they are listening carefully in class at any time.</p>
<p>(6) There are too few books and magazines. Funds should be allocated to add them year by year.</p>
<p>(7) Special attention should be paid to student training.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Shanghai College of Law, a Private College <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Since the school was established a year ago, it has made considerable efforts in the construction of school buildings and the rectification of school affairs. However, the following points still need to be improved.</p>
<p>(1) Supervision of classes, self-study, and examinations should be tightened.</p>
<p>(2) Hire more full-time basic faculty.</p>
<p>(3) Enrich the library, improve its management methods, and promote academic research.</p>
<p>(4) The debts owed by the school should be planned by the school's board of directors to find ways to clear them.</p>
<p>The school is allowed to continue enrollment this year, but each of the two existing departments is only allowed to enroll one class, and the number of students in each class should not exceed 50. The qualifications of new students must be strictly reviewed, and entrance examinations must be held in earnest to improve student level.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Shanghai College of Law and Political Science, a Private College <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Since the school purchased a new campus site and cleared up debt disputes a year ago, it can be seen that it can still work hard. However, the following points still need to be improved. (1) The school's current school buildings are too narrow and located in a noisy environment, which is not suitable for schools. A new school building should be built on the newly purchased site and completed within one year.</p>
<p>(2) The school's main responsible personnel still have concurrent positions and classes outside the school, which is inappropriate. Although the number of teachers has reportedly increased, in reality, many are still concurrently teaching and working in other schools. In the future, the main personnel should be absolutely restricted from working or teaching outside the school, and teachers should be hired as much as possible who can serve full-time.</p>
<p>(3) The school has always been too lenient in admitting new students. This year, it is tentatively allowed to continue enrollment, but in the next academic year, only one enrollment will be allowed in the fall, and the total number of students in each department should not exceed 90, of which the Department of Law should not exceed 40. The qualifications of new students must be carefully reviewed, and entrance examinations must be strictly held. In addition, the school's Group B should still be terminated in accordance with the previous order and no more enrollment should be made.</p>
<p>(4) The library of the school urgently needs to be enriched. The library fees paid by students should be used to purchase books in full and should not be used to pay the salaries of employees in the library. (5) The number of student absences has reportedly decreased slightly compared with before, but regulations should still be formulated and effectively curbed to eliminate long-standing problems.</p>
<p>(6) Implement strict training to eliminate the previous bad school atmosphere.</p>

<p>Since the school was instructed to improve last year, except that the new school building has been started, there has been no progress in other aspects. The main points of the report are again presented, and should be seriously improved.</p>
<p>(1) The school's current school buildings are not suitable for schools. The construction of the new school buildings should be accelerated and completed during the summer vacation this year.</p>
<p>(2) The school has very few books, which are not enough for students to use for reference after class. Funds should be allocated to add them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(3) The school's important personnel have failed to take effective responsibility, the administration is not on track, school affairs are neglected, and various forms are inaccurate. Most of the teachers are part-time, the treatment is meager, and there are many absences. In the future, the administrative aspect should be thoroughly rectified. Important personnel must be hired as full-time personnel who can take responsibility. Teachers should be based on the principle of full-time and restricted from teaching outside the school. (4) The school's enrollment of new students is too excessive. Students in the school are absent from class at will and without restriction. The level is quite uneven, and there are very few good ones. In the future, the enrollment should be increased to a standard of strict enrollment. Only one enrollment is allowed in the fall each year, and the total number should not exceed 60. The current students should strictly curb absenteeism and train them effectively.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Interpretation</p>
<h3 id="e245">Limits of Supervision and Guidance of Jointly Established Middle Schools <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously received a report from the Gansu Education Department that counties often have disputes over the limits of supervision and guidance of jointly established schools, and it is very difficult to handle them in this city because there is no basis. It requested detailed instructions on the standards for dividing the limits of supervision and guidance of jointly established schools. The Ministry once instructed the department, roughly saying that jointly established middle schools should be supervised and guided by the competent administrative organs in the location of the middle school, and matters that the provincial department should report to the jointly established middle school should be forwarded separately by the competent educational administrative organs in the location. When the competent educational administrative organs of the jointly established counties have important instructions for the jointly established middle school, they should jointly issue the instructions to the middle school. The important facilities of the middle school should also be submitted to the competent educational administrative organs of the jointly established counties for approval. It is heard that the situation in the province is similar and an interpretation is requested. It has been instructed by citing the previous situation.</p>

<h3 id="e249">Key Points of Student Summer Work <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>The city party headquarters yesterday telegraphed to the party headquarters of various provinces and cities to comply with the order of the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee (excerpt above). It is found that schools in various places are now on vacation in accordance with regulations, and most students have returned to their original places of origin. Youth is the backbone of the people and the lifeline of the country. At a time when national difficulties are serious, it is not a time for long-term idleness. The key points of the student summer work are specially formulated below. It is hoped that you will check them and instruct your subordinates to handle them separately in accordance with the needs of the local environment. The key points are: (1) Promoting the New Life Movement, (2) Investigating social conditions, (3) Giving lectures on popular common sense. In rural areas, focus on agricultural improvements. In cities, focus on civic training, (4) Holding simple literacy schools, (5) Holding proper and simple entertainment. When promoting the above tasks, attention must be paid to close coordination with local governments and school authorities. The required expenses should also be jointly responsible for raising them, and the handling situation should be reported at any time for review.

<h3 id="e250">Strive to Recover the Right to Education in the Concessions <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>The board of directors passed six improvement measures and requested the Education Bureau and all public organizations to unanimously advocate that the Shanghai Municipal Education Association held its 27th board of directors meeting yesterday. The attendees were Zhang Zhongdao, Xu Zeye, Huang Zaoxiong, Tao Baichuan, Ma Jiazhen, and Chen Jicheng. Zhang Zhongdao chaired the meeting, and Zhang Lichun recorded the minutes. First, Huang Zaoxiong reported on the closing of the people's schools and the student's further education and employment guidance. Then, the matters for discussion were (1) The Eleventh District Education Association requested that the members of the association be mostly gone, and the re-election seemed inappropriate. The fifth executive meeting decided to re-solicit new and old members for a regular re-election. The resolution was approved to follow (2) The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, etc. sent a letter to invite the association to jointly initiate the farewell to the students who will go to Europe and the United States for further study. The resolution was approved and the association participated in the joint initiation and appointed Xu Zeye and Huang Zaoxiong as representatives of the association. (3) The members' meeting of the association resolved to urge the government to recover the right to education in the concessions. Now, five improvement methods for the education in the concessions are proposed for approval. The resolution was approved and submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau and sent to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Concessions, the Private School Coordination Association of the Public Concession, schools at all levels in the Concessions, and various legal public organizations to strive for it together. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. The methods are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Measures to Improve Education in the Concessions <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Chinese Education Office of the Public Concession should be renamed the "Public Concession Bureau of Works Public School Management Office." Its powers should be limited to managing the primary and secondary schools established by the bureau. Administratively, it should be subject to the supervision of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. As for schools within the concession not established by the Bureau of Works, the Management Office will not interfere. (2) The members of the Private School Subsidy Committee of the Public Concession shall be jointly organized by one-third of the members from the Bureau of Works Education Committee, the Municipal Education Bureau, and the Municipal Education Association.</p>
<p>(3) The school health inspectors employed by the Bureau of Works must no longer be Westerners who do not understand the situation of Chinese schools and have no research on school hygiene. In the future, three Chinese doctors with experience in public health research should be selected, and one of them should be appointed by the Subsidy Committee.</p>
<p>(4) Social education in the concessions seems to be too neglected. The Bureau of Works should allocate funds for social education purposes.</p>
<p>(5) The expenditure of the Bureau of Works on Chinese children's schools should be reduced as much as possible. The funds originally intended by the Bureau of Works to increase Chinese children's schools should be transferred to social education and private school subsidies.</p>
<p>(6) The Municipal Education Bureau should organize a special committee to be responsible for designing and improving education in the concessions.</p>
<p>Secondary School</p>
<h3 id="e252">Science Teachers' Training Class Begins Today <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>Classes Start Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau of this city, upon the order of the Ministry, and in conjunction with National Jiaotong University and Private Datong University, has been preparing for the summer training class for secondary school science teachers for over a month.

Furthermore, all registered students of the class have been allowed to reside at Jiaotong University since yesterday, and formal classes will begin tomorrow. Science teachers from various schools who have not registered (except those who have been specially approved by the Education Bureau to be exempted) are reportedly allowed to register and attend classes within one week of the start of classes to show flexibility. However, students who are absent from classes for more than one-third of the time will not be allowed to participate in the examination.</p>

<p>Annual Meeting of the Science Society of China</p>
<h3 id="e256">Continuing to Solicit Papers from Members <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Submit to the Nanjing Meteorological Research Institute by the end of July. The 19th annual meeting of the Science Society of China is scheduled to be held in Guling, Nanchang, starting on August 21st, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the Papers Committee recently issued a notice to continue soliciting papers. The original letter is as follows: The annual meeting of our society is scheduled to be held at Lushan from August 21st to 27th. All committees for lectures and papers have been appointed, and the reading and discussion of papers are particularly important objectives of the annual meeting. They should be collected as early as possible to achieve perfection. With the abundance of specialized talents in our society, there must be magnificent works that crown the world. However, the paper aspect has not been fully represented in the past. Lushan is quiet and secluded, with less social interaction, which is enough to focus on academics. We hope that all members of the society will contribute their great works so that they can be collected and discussed. Please send the abstracts of the papers to the Nanjing Beijige Meteorological Research Institute by the end of July for compilation and distribution at the meeting. Sincerely, Zhu Kezhen and others, the Paper Committee of the 19th Annual Meeting.</p>
<p>Chinese Chemical Society</p>
<h3 id="e257">Annual Meeting Scheduled to Be Held in Shanghai <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Starting August 9th at Jiaotong University. The Chinese Chemical Society is one of the leading scientific organizations in the country, with more than 400 members. Branches have been established in major cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Jinan. Founded two years ago, it has achieved remarkable results. Its second annual meeting has been decided to be held in Shanghai starting on August 9th. The meeting place will be in the Wenzhi Hall of Jiaotong University in Xujiahui. Members from all over the country who attend the meeting have been approved by the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications to be granted similar preferential treatment. The organizing committee has now begun soliciting papers from all members.</p>
<p>Students Taking Make-up Exams for Secondary School Graduation</p>
<h3 id="e258">Petition the Education Bureau to Advance the Make-up Exams <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Otherwise, it will have a significant impact on further education or employment. Shanghai Haishe reported that students from more than a dozen schools such as Junyi, Qingxin, and Private Shangzhong, who are taking make-up exams for the entrance examination, have jointly petitioned the Municipal Education Bureau to advance the make-up exams. Although those who take the make-up exams can still enter universities, in fact, those who are admitted to distant provinces such as Beiping and Guangdong inevitably have conflicts in the examination times during the winter vacation. Moreover, those who are employed account for the majority. Under this qualification distribution, if there is no certificate, it will feel like there is no way to enter. If the make-up exams are taken during the winter vacation, those who fail one or two subjects will lose half a year of employment opportunities, which will have a significant impact. Therefore, they petition the Education Bureau to approve the advancement of the make-up exams.</p>

<h3 id="e263">New Second Elementary School Building <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Western Women's Middle School (formerly known as the Sino-Western Girls' School) in this city has been established for many years and has a good reputation. Since Ms. Yang Xizhen has been the principal, it has made new contributions to society from time to time. Recently, in view of the importance of children's education, a new and modern elementary school building has been built at the corner of Xi'ai Arms Road and Tailasi Tuo Road in the French Concession.

<h3 id="e266">New Tennis Techniques (10) <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>Original by J. PARMLY PARET, Translated by Qian Yiqin and Hong Jun｜Copyright Reserved, No Reproduction Allowed｜</p>
<p>Having discussed the various main ways of forehand strokes, let us now study them in turn, and analyze the various ways to see which one is the most perfect and complete. Usually, the most effective and valuable one seems to be the top-spinning twist from above, because in this way of stroking, the racket is slightly angled upwards, and the swing of the racket is upwards, and the strings brush against the surface of the ball, so the ball flies forward in a spinning way. The benefit of this way is that the ball is spinning forward when it flies forward, so it has a tendency to fall, and it does not fly straight forward. Compared with the straight shot, it lands much faster, so it does not fly out of bounds when stroking heavily.</p>
<p>As for studying why the forward-spinning ball can automatically land, the real reason and the principle of mechanics will be discussed in detail later when discussing the spinning stroke and its effectiveness. Now, just understand that using this method, the ball lands much faster, and there is also a great benefit, that is, when the player hits hard, the ball always lands within the line and does not fly over it.</p>
<p>Because in order to produce the above-mentioned effect, when the player starts to stroke, the forward swing of the racket should be slightly lower than the intended stroke place. When the racket is hitting the ball, the forward swing of the racket should be slightly upward. Some players with excellent skills, they use this method to first swing the racket flat towards the incoming ball. When the strings and the surface of the ball are about to touch, they immediately swing the racket upward and twist the ball hard. Therefore, the ball is brushed by the strings and flies forward in a spinning way.</p>
<p>Regardless of which of the above two methods is adopted, the player should try to make the surface of the ball and the strings have more contact time. The longer the contact time, the more confident the player is in controlling his stroke. If the racket hits the top of the incoming ball, the ball will definitely be difficult to fly over the net. This is very obvious, so when stroking, the racket face should be slightly inclined to meet the top of the incoming ball, and then swing upwards. At this time, the shape of the racket is of course with the bottom edge backward and the top edge forward.</p>
<p>The most important part of applying this method is that after the ball has been hit, the swing of the racket should be made as smoothly as possible. Do not try too hard to twist the ball and stop the swing, because in order to make the ball fly forward in a spinning way, and to shorten its flight path, you must swing the racket all the way over your left shoulder. To shorten its flight path, you must still swing the racket head over your neck smoothly. Therefore, after the ball has left the strings, the wrist should be relaxed immediately. When the upper arm swings across the chest, the racket head must pass over the left shoulder, and the power of the racket will automatically stop, and there is no need to use wrist strength to stop it.</p>
<p>Speaking of the benefits of this method, in addition to the above-mentioned - the ball spins forward, lands faster, and can be stroked hard without flying over the line - there are even greater benefits, because the ball spins forward and lands quickly, so its rebound force must be stronger and farther. In this case, the opponent has no choice but to retreat backwards to meet it. Furthermore, this method makes the ball fly faster in the air than the undercutting method, and the ball spins forward quickly, making it difficult for the opponent to intercept it effectively.</p>
<p>At this time, the opponent has two disadvantages when intercepting the incoming ball, one is that the ball is spinning forward and will immediately fall down when it flies over the net. If this method is used properly, the ball must already be very low when it flies to the opponent's side. He must slowly lift the ball over the net to intercept it. At this time, the spinning force of the ball will shoot slightly obliquely upwards when it comes into contact with his racket. Secondly, when encountering an opponent who is good at intercepting, although the ball in his hand will not shoot upwards obliquely, the method of stroking must be slow, and the flight path of the ball must be slightly higher, making it easy to deal with. This is also a very obvious benefit.</p>
<p>However, there is also a great danger in using this method, that is, the player often has a tendency to try too hard to make the ball spin, thus forgetting the insufficient forward thrusting force when stroking, so that the ball cannot fly into the opponent quickly and deeply. This type of stroke cannot be used for impact. Practice until the contact between the strings and the ball can be longer, and when contacting, a sweeping motion is used to generate the rotation. After stroking, the ball immediately leaves the racket quickly. This is very obvious, but if more sweeping motion is used and less impact motion is used when stroking, the contact between the ball and the racket can naturally be extended. British players are more skilled in this method, and when they meet the incoming ball, the racket is swept out flat. When the surface of the ball is in contact with the strings and has not left, the wrist takes advantage of the momentum to turn, thus generating the force for the ball to spin forward.</p>

This competition will use the Xianfang Cup teams of the China Tennis Association as the basic players, inviting four players from each team to participate in the competition. They will also invite the Chinese Tennis Association on Singapore Road, the Chinese Sports Association on Hartung Road, and other well-known tennis players to participate, gathering famous Chinese players in one place for a competition of tennis skills.

<p>Gu Wenqing Arrived at the Finish Line First</p>
<p>In order to take advantage of the summer vacation to facilitate the progress of team members, the West Light Cross-Country Team has specially sold the team members staying in Shanghai to organize a summer training class, which has started last week. Yesterday morning, the team held its first general practice on Zhonghua Road, circling the city for a total of 5,500 meters. More than 20 people participated. Yao Zhongsheng and Mao Yinhai flew side by side at the start, leading the group and taking the lead all the way. After Xiaodongmen, the road was flat, and the jade legs were stretched out. At that time, Yao Zhongsheng was in the lead, Mao Yinhai was behind, and Gu Wenqing was third. Unexpectedly, good things are often hindered, and the strength is limited. Yao Zhongsheng gradually became unable to support himself after Laoximen, and Gu Wenqing strode forward, reaching the finish line first with a time of 19 minutes and 7 seconds. The other rankings are as follows: (2) Yao Zhongsheng, (3) Mao Yinhai, (4) Wan Dasheng, (5) Xu Zhengqing, (6) Pan Yunwen, (7) Gao Jinghua, (8) Xie Qunying. It is also heard that the team is scheduled to hold its 15th staff meeting at 866 Zhonghua Road at 3:00 PM today to discuss important ongoing matters. Staff members Wu Chunyuan, Zhou Zuyu, Ren Su, Yuan Qizhen, Gu Wenqing, Tan Zhenglong, Guan Yunxiang, etc. must be present on time. In order to increase the interest of the team members, the team is scheduled to hold a whole-team power competition next week. The route will follow the Shanghai-China round-trip long-distance race organized by the team last year, starting from Zhonghua Road, entering Daxixing Street and Lujiabang through Xiaoximen, turning into Kangqu Road, passing Shihuibridge and going straight to Longhua Town and returning. The whole journey is about 17,200 meters. It is recalled that the champion Lan Shiqian last year had a time of one hour, zero minutes and thirty-six seconds.</p>

<p>The Lingnan Sports Association came in a letter stating that in the Lingnan vs. Customs Jia Yi match in the Shanghai West Small Ball Competition on the 7th of this month, although Customs Jia won with a score of one to zero, Lingnan protested to the Shanghai West Committee due to unfair refereeing. This matter has been over ten days, and no formal response has been received from the association. However, yesterday, the Shanghai West Association suddenly disclosed in various newspapers the news of the rematch between Lingnan and Customs, which made Lingnan extremely strange. Therefore, the sports team immediately replied to Shanghai West, stating that it could not fulfill the match for the following reasons: (1) If there is such a match, it should be notified according to past procedures, not one day in advance, making it difficult to gather the team members. (2) The protest against the Customs Jia match has not been formally responded to, or the previous match has not been canceled, and Lingnan should not encounter Customs Jia again. (3) The competition is set as a single cycle, and two teams in the same group should not be made to compete again, etc. They requested an explanation from Shanghai West. It is heard that this matter may expand, and Lingnan may present the whole story to the public to seek a fair judgment.</p>

<h3 id="e276">On Freedom of Marriage <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>Since the opening of maritime restrictions and the eastward spread of Western culture, the clamor for freedom of marriage has shaken our "parents' command" and "matchmaker's words" – the "marry a chicken, follow the chicken; marry a dog, follow the dog" style marriage rules. Following the "Xinhai" Revolution, some reformist men and women raised the banner of rebellion, practicing autonomous marriage. By the time of the "May Fourth" Movement, the discussion on freedom of marriage and even freedom of love had reached a theoretical dead end; it had become a conclusion: marriage should be free, and love should be free! Who knew that after the so-called "National Revolution" surged up from the "May Thirtieth" Movement, it has been seven or eight years, and we still see news in the newspapers every day about young people forced into arranged marriages committing suicide, especially women! How can this be? We truly cannot help but feel a sense of "What kind of world is this!"</p>
<p>However, looking at the current laws, in the Civil Code, Book Four, Chapter Two, "Marriage" section, there are clearly such provisions:</p>
<p>Section 1: Engagement</p>
<p>Article 972: Engagement should be entered into independently by the man and woman involved.</p>
<p>Article 973: A man under the age of seventeen or a woman under the age of fifteen may not enter into an engagement.</p>
<p>Article 774: Minors of either sex entering into an engagement must obtain the consent of their legal guardian.</p>
<p>Article 975: Engagement may not be enforced by coercion.</p>
<p>This was promulgated by the National Government on December 26th of the 19th year and implemented on May 5th of the 20th year! It seems not to be a bounced check. However, what is publicized in the newspapers is not just the suicide by well-throwing of Shi Jihua, a student at the Hangxing Elementary Girls' School; or the collective drowning death of nine women in Hui'an, Fujian; even in the capital, Nanjing, in the same month of June, there was a Li Lianlin who, opposing an arranged marriage, swore to death that she would not marry. Unable to withstand the coercion of her stubborn father, she took sleeping pills and died! (See the Nanjing Dihua Evening News of June 3rd.) Why is it that so many young women have died, and yet it is "unseen and unheard"? The current Criminal Code, Book One, Chapter Twenty-Five, "Crimes Against Freedom," also clearly has the following provisions:</p>
<p>Article 318: Anyone who uses violence or coercion to compel another to do something they are not obligated to do, or obstructs another from exercising their rights, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of no more than three years, detention, or a fine of no more than three hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Attempted crimes under this article shall be punished.</p>
<p>Article 319: Anyone who threatens another with harm to their life, body, freedom, reputation, or property, causing danger to their safety, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of no more than three years, detention, or a fine of no more than three hundred yuan.</p>
<p>May I ask: Doesn't despotic arranged marriage, and even the coercion to enforce it, constitute a violation of the "crimes against freedom" in the criminal law – especially the two articles cited above? All citizens are equal before the law of the country! In theory and according to the law, it doesn't matter who is the parent and who is the child! However, what is most incomprehensible is that the suicides of women in Hangzhou and Fujian in opposition to despotic marriages can still be said to be cases where their parents did not exert obvious coercion, while in the death of Li Lianlin in Nanjing, her father's coercion was extremely evident. Why do we not see prosecutors "investigating" and "prosecuting"? Is it that young women are not protected by the laws of the country, and that parents can arbitrarily decide their life and death? Regarding this truth, we hope to receive a public and detailed explanation from the "legislative" and "judicial" organs! At the same time, we also hope that lawyers who pride themselves on protecting human rights and legal interests can give us some brilliant and correct opinions on "legal texts," "legal principles," and "precedents"!</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding this issue – the victory of freedom of marriage – although the specter of feudalism is still active everywhere, I believe it is not a very difficult matter. For example, before the "Xinhai" Revolution, parents and other elder relatives could execute their children at will, which was not prohibited by law. Later, the law was revised, and killing children (regardless of whether they were disobedient or disgraced the family) was the same as committing murder. In the past twenty-odd years, such incidents have been rare. Autonomous marriage, the Civil Code clearly stipulates that it should be entered into independently by the parties involved, and also stipulates that it may not be enforced by coercion! Moreover, in the Criminal Code, there are provisions on "crimes against freedom" that can be relied upon for redress and relief! Laws are not bounced checks after all. If everyone publicizes them and applies them, their effectiveness will be substantial! The times are advancing after all. If everyone knows the truth of the "current law," who would willingly do such a stupid thing that harms their children and violates the national law? Speaking of this, I hope that future school education should provide students with legal knowledge so that young women in general know how to use the law and do not die unjustly.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Women and Cinema <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Caoling</p>
<p>According to the general observation of ticket collectors at theaters, about 50% of moviegoers are women. According to the conversation with people in charge of film companies, there are always several letters written by women every day asking to be actors. From these two perspectives, we can confirm that women and cinema have an interactive relationship.</p>
<p>Indeed, the film industry in China is a new and promising enterprise. It is a powerful new force in Chinese culture. It has a significant mission: its future fate and prosperity are of great importance to the future of Chinese culture! On the one hand, it is an excellent phenomenon for women to bravely participate in this new cultural movement – which is, of course, also a new path for women's liberation and independent women's occupations – or to support this movement.</p>
<p>But reality is the proof of theory, and reality will show all the ugly phenomena to everyone. What are the women who are now engaged in the film industry like? What is the attitude of the women (phenomenon) who are now supporting this new cultural movement?</p>
<p>Obviously, the new film industry has been tainted by the individual irregular actions of a small number of female employees (that is, the wrong actions taken by those who do not truly understand film but are engaged in it). Of course, I would never say here that the ugliness of the entire film industry stems from this point, but I don't think anyone would deny that if a small part of an entire industry is not on the right track, it will inevitably restrain or affect the whole. The poor state of the film industry has more significant reasons than this, but the female employees' ignorance of the cultural mission of film, as well as their actions that do not cherish themselves, and the dishonor they find for themselves, will inevitably affect the progress of the entire film movement. On the other hand, the fact that very meaningful and good films are not welcomed by women clearly shows that women do not truly understand "film art" and are not truly supporting "film art."</p>
<p>Of course, the past is the past. The future of Chinese film art has great hope. At the same time, Chinese film art urgently needs women who understand it to bravely participate, pioneer, and support it!</p>
<p>We will never deny that participating in the film industry is a new profession for women with a cultural mission. At the same time, we will never hesitate to think that the time for understanding and supporting film culture has not yet arrived.</p>
<p>For the sake of the early realization of good phenomena, we must put forward the following specific opinions.</p>
<p>1. We hope that all high schools and above (coeducational) have theoretical courses on film so that people can understand "film art" a little more.</p>
<p>2. We hope that there is a specialized film department in a certain school. Especially for women. Because the general phenomenon now is that the intellectual level of female film employees is lower than that of male employees.</p>
<p>These are preventive suggestions.</p>
<p>1. Standing on the standpoint of women's liberation itself, we should expose the shortcomings of female film employees.</p>
<p>2. We should eliminate all the evil environments and forces that tempt female film employees to fall into depravity.</p>
<p>3. Women's publications should have simple theories or introductions about film.</p>
<h3 id="e278">On Women (Continued) <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Gorky, translated by Wan Qimei</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Seeing is not as good as knowing, and the basis of knowledge is labor experience, not "speculation." Perhaps men see more than women, but their knowledge is limited to the narrow skills of how hunters kill animals.</p>
<p>Women settle down, and their knowledge accumulation process gradually develops due to the protection of life, health, increasing food, and improving working conditions. What is most noteworthy is that religious historians have said almost nothing about the role women played in the formation of religious rituals.</p>
<p>Generally, the creators of religious ideas were the old men watching the stove. Although they had lost their ability to work, they had rich experience in killing wild animals and knowledge of the principles of corporate action. Therefore, these old men were the authority in the hunting tribe.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out in passing that religious researchers always underestimate the role of water and fire in stimulating the imagination. Fire is a majestic but lovely force. It has a vibrant power and an unyielding desire to burn. It has dazzling beauty and agile action. It has a pleasant skill in making meat more delicious. It can turn trees into ashes, smash stones, and sometimes turn stones into liquid. It can destroy water, make water boil and turn into gas. In short, fire, this diverse and strange force, undoubtedly and powerfully influenced the development of primitive people's imagination. Water probably has the same effect. People see water everywhere: their bodies also have water; wet trees also evaporate water when burning; in the water flow, people can see their shadows, although the water is flowing, it does not wash away his shadow; water meets fire, either water destroys fire, or water is destroyed by fire and turns into gas and rises; sometimes meteors and lightning are found in the sky. All these things, people have seen, but as mentioned above, there is a big difference between seeing and knowing. A religious thinker, someone like Sha, Luo Weifu, etc., gave a definition of the ability to see, saying that the occurrence of seeing seems to be unrelated to human reason, and is not subordinate to the phenomena of the real world, he created another divine world.</p>
<p>To add this ability to primitive humans is to put primitive people together with Swedenborg and other illusionists. Primitive people are personal anthropomorphists. When they begin to consciously treat natural phenomena, they find similarities with themselves in nature. At that time, people fought for nature and did not need metaphysics. Primitive people did not respect nature as God, but only "according to their own image" "viewed nature as a soul". Therefore, primitive people used magic to fight against nature. At that time, sorcery and witchcraft were not metaphysical.</p>
<p>What bourgeois cultural historians care about is not to reveal the true meaning of facts, they only select materials for preconceived conclusions. What they find in the prehistoric past is not the cultural founders that archeology and ethnography tell us – ancient laborers, but the "companions" of these people – gods, without gods, primitive people seem unable to live.</p>
<p>The need for metaphysics is not for fighting against nature, but for opposing people. The occurrence of theism is not out of the joyous motives of ancient religious historians, but out of the priests' ambition to defend their rule over people. Needless to say, it is very difficult to trace the development of realistic ideas that are inspired by the process of people's labor and life struggles.</p>
<p>The study of primitive culture began in the eighteenth century, and the research materials have undergone countless changes in thousands of years due to the complex mixture of concepts of various tribes and races.</p>
<p>Assuming that people, based on practice, have already had a kind of "foreknowledge" that can overcome nature, and regard themselves as heroes, great men, and even gods, this still does not mean metaphysics or the supernatural, because the "Olympus" gods are completely real "nobles," and the "Edda" gods are just typical Norwegian farmers. The gods of general cults are mostly idealized typical craftsmen. (Later deleted) (End of this section, the whole article is not finished)</p>
<h3 id="e279">After Reading Biwuwu's "On Adultery and Murder" <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Hao Yu</p>
<p>Today, I opened the newspaper and read Biwuwu's article "On Adultery and Murder", and I couldn't help but feel emotional. Adultery and murder is indeed a criminal act, which is inexcusable in law and morality.</p>
<p>The act of killing, no matter whether its motive is revenge, love, or adultery, is not allowed by law. As long as you kill someone, or attempt to kill someone, you deserve to be punished. Adultery and murder is not protected or defended by any law. Therefore, we understand that this matter of adultery and murder is difficult to eradicate even with the most severe laws, just like other murder cases.</p>
<p>Biwuwu said: "Under the prevention of propriety, women are willing to risk death to communicate a little affection with other men, and her married life is undoubtedly not satisfactory; and the reason for that dissatisfaction is often because the husband has an affair. In this situation, who should die?" I think no one should die. Because this kind of illicit affair is wrong for everyone. The wife has an affair with another man, and that man is also someone else's husband; at the same time, her own husband has an affair with another woman, which is just like she has an affair with another man, so I think that the man killing his wife, or the woman poisoning her husband, is equally wrong. If couples cannot communicate with each other, and even cannot spend the night together, then what kind of couple is that? It is better to be frank and each be with the person who is able to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>However, in today's society, the minds of most people are still bound by propriety, and the remnants of feudalism have not been eliminated. People inevitably look down on divorced people – especially women. Therefore, there are many couples in name only – who are actually unhappy couples – who dare not easily file for divorce; another reason is that for couples who file for divorce, the man has to bear a sum of alimony that he cannot afford, so he would rather the couple hate each other than get a divorce. The result is that they end up trying to commit suicide, or having affairs with others, and all kinds of unfortunate things happen. Why bother? If couples cannot feel any interest in each other, they should leave. It is better to reconcile when either party realizes that they were wrong in the future, which is more refreshing than a hypocritical couple suffering mental pain. Moreover, forcing things to continue can really make the broken relationship more and more rigid, to the point where it cannot be salvaged.</p>
<p>Although that's what I said, can society allow us to act so freely? There are now many freely divorced people who are subject to much criticism and discrimination. No wonder so many unhappy couples would rather endure mental pain and continue to support themselves, while seeking lovers elsewhere; doesn't such behavior receive social criticism and condemnation? However, we must know: society is organized by people, and divorce and affairs are done by people; criticism and condemnation are also done by people. Since they are both things done by people, why should we scold ourselves? If we think that free marriage is legal, why is free divorce not legal? What is there to criticize? What is there to condemn? Social affairs are all behaviors of people. If the current society allows people to marry and divorce freely, there is no need to condemn the divorce of others; if someone wants to condemn, those people are not people of the current society, but people of the previous century, they are zombies, what do we people of the current society fear from them?</p>
<h3 id="e280">The Simplest and Most Accurate Pregnancy Prediction Method: 23.7, 8 <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>There have been two or three methods for predicting pregnancy, but they are all very troublesome and not very accurate. Recently, Dr. Fukushima of Kumamoto Medical University in Japan has newly invented a very simple prediction method. This method is quite consistent with scientific principles, and the results of the doctor's experiments are actually very accurate. Now I will introduce it below.</p>
<p>Diagnosis method</p>
<p>You can put the pregnant woman's urine in a glass tube, add a few drops of bromine water, and after ten minutes, add a few drops of a mixture of strong ammonia water and ammonium carbonate water, and shake it slightly. The urine of a pregnant woman contains a large amount of Histidine, so the urine will turn pink. If it is said that it is not pregnant, then it will not change color. This is just using the hydrolysis of Histidine, so the procedure is very simple.</p>
<p>Confirmation</p>
<p>Dr. Fukushima used this method to conduct experiments on women in the attached hospital of the school. Among the fifty women who were asked to pre-diagnose pregnancy, forty-six were positive (i.e., changed color) and four were negative. The results were very accurate. Then, he tested dozens of ordinary healthy women (non-pregnant women), and most of them were negative (i.e., no discoloration). From this, it can be seen that this method can be used in practice.</p>
<h3 id="e281">"Autumn Wind, Autumn Rain Sadden People to Death" <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Fangshiren</p>
<p>In this year's summer, when the rain shadows are vague, the heat waves are high, and the land is cracking everywhere, reading the publications commemorating Ms. Qiu Jin, I can't help but feel a burst of coolness and comfort. Recalling the morning of the sixth day of the sixth lunar month in the old calendar of 1907, a hero devoted to the racial revolution, the female knight Qiu Jin, after being arrested, before being killed at Xuetingkou in Shaoxing, the only confession she wrote to the plague official, who was even more ferocious than a beast, was just the terse sentence "Autumn rain, autumn wind, all kill people." Can we not feel a stream of sadness and magnificence surging into our hearts?</p>
<p>Although she was born in a bureaucratic family in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and later became the daughter-in-law of a wealthy gentry in Xiangtan, Qiu Jin was always the epitome of a most progressive new woman in a specific era and specific society. She was a round of blazing summer sun that broke through the old atmosphere of sorrowful autumn rain and autumn wind! Seeing her take off her gorgeous clothes and jewelry and run to Japan to study, she immediately joined the Tongmenghui: after returning to China, she lived in Houdeli, Hongkou, Shanghai, and made explosives with her comrades. The medicine exploded, and she was injured. In addition, she was almost caught by the police and went to jail. After that, under severe oppression, she secretly organized the anti-Qing Restoration Army. Finally, she was arrested after being betrayed, but despite suffering all kinds of punishments that we can imagine, the only confession of this solid and strong female warrior was still "Autumn rain, autumn wind, all kill people"! Although she belonged to the previous generation of women, her courageous spirit has turned the degenerate modern ladies of the contemporary era decades later into shameless goblins!</p>
<p>Singing "The Yellow River originates from the Zhejiang tide, guarding my Chinese Han heroes, do not let the Manchurian barbarians leave a piece of armor, the Xuanyuan God is a natural pride", Qiu Jin, from the perspective of Hua Mulan who "bid farewell to the Yellow River in the morning, and slept in the Blackwater in the evening, did not hear the voice of her parents calling her daughter, but only heard the sound of the Yan Mountain Hu cavalry whining", must be incredibly great. Indeed, from the narrow family affection of flesh and blood, and setting out to join the army on behalf of her father, Hua Mulan, to Qiu Jin who organized the so-called Restoration Army for the people and for the Han people, in between, the progress of the new woman is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Of course! Qiu Jin, who advocated "restoring the Han people and greatly revitalizing national power", seems ridiculously narrow from the perspective of the new soldiers in the current national liberation movement! But this is the era that restricts her. She has made the greatest and best efforts to fulfill the task that the era imposed on her. If, in the current stage of the Chinese national liberation movement, there are still people singing the old tunes of "restoring the Han people and greatly revitalizing national power", or preparing for the massacre of nation against nation, then the ghost of Qiu Jin, who is lying in a solitary tomb by the West Lake, will never be able to rest in peace!</p>
<p>Autumn rain and autumn wind are always so sad, but where are the new women like Qiu Jin who wave flags and shout to sweep away this evil atmosphere?</p>
<h3 id="e282">The Sex Knowledge That Women Should Have (Continued) <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>(2) Positions during intercourse</p>
<p>Generally, young men often ask their partners to take one or several abnormal positions (sitting or standing, etc.) during intercourse, causing some women to develop diseases that damage the vagina even after being married for several years or having given birth several times. Especially for those whose reproductive organs are unbalanced, it is easier to cause cracks in the posterior fornix of the vagina, which causes the same symptoms as those mentioned above. This also needs attention.</p>
<p>(3) Abstaining from intercourse during menstruation</p>
<p>Women's libido is at its highest during menstruation (especially at the end of it): however, intercourse is absolutely forbidden during menstruation. Because menstruation is a manifestation of the destruction and bleeding of the uterine mucosa, which is the same as a uterine injury. If you have intercourse during menstruation, it is tantamount to giving bacteria a chance to invade the uterus, causing endometritis, peritonitis, and other diseases. Moreover, the physical stimulation during intercourse can easily cause the danger of bleeding. At the same time, men are also prone to urethritis, pseudo-gonorrhea, and other diseases.</p>
<p>(4) Restrictions on intercourse during pregnancy</p>
<p>Some medical experts advocate absolutely stopping intercourse during pregnancy, which may be an extreme view. However, intercourse during pregnancy must be limited. In the first half of pregnancy, it is okay to have moderate intercourse - the most important thing about moderation is to avoid excessive sexual excitement, excessive exertion, and heavy pressure on the abdomen, to prevent uterine bleeding and miscarriage. As for the second half of pregnancy, especially the last two months, intercourse must be prohibited; otherwise, uterine bleeding, premature rupture of the amniotic membrane, premature birth, and fever after childbirth may occur.</p>
<p>(5) Cleaning after intercourse</p>
<p>Many Chinese women suffer from leucorrhea, and the reason for this is mostly due to the lack of cleanliness of the reproductive organs; because of its uncleanness, it causes uterine diseases. Therefore, keeping the reproductive organs clean is the only good way to reduce women's diseases, especially after intercourse, it must be thoroughly washed. The washing is best done half an hour after the event. The method is: use a vaginal irrigator filled with lukewarm liquid, insert it into the cavity and wash it. The liquid, such as one percent carbolic acid, two percent Lysol, or boiled and sterilized saline, can be used. (The End)</p>

<p>— Han Wang</p>
<p>Little friends! Aside from studying at school, don't you often like to read books on your own?</p>
<p>When reading, you should consider both practicality and interest. Because we always gain a lot from reading books we enjoy.</p>
<p>Reading is certainly a good thing, and reading books you like is even better. However, little friends! You should pay attention to whether your interests are good? That is to say; are the books you like good?</p>
<p>When you put together the interests of many people, you will know that the levels of interest are very different. Many people have interests that are beneficial to individuals, society, and the country. However, many interests are harmful. Little friends are at the time to store up knowledge, so how careful should you be in choosing interests?</p>
<p>How to choose interests? This is a very big problem.</p>
<p>Here, I can only briefly tell you all: you should first consider whether your interests can increase knowledge, increase the ability to think, or whether they are beneficial to a certain course at school? In this way, you have already selected your interests. As for getting books that are close to your interests, little friends should ask their fathers, elder brothers, and teachers whether these books should be read?</p>
<h3 id="e286">Summer is the Season for Children <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Yangzijiang</p>
<p>No matter whose seasons spring, autumn, and winter are, in short, this summer is our children's season. Where does this come from? Little friends: please be patient and listen to me slowly.</p>
<p>Because the summer vacation is the longest, almost two months, then during that long vacation, we can do whatever we want. In the city, you can stroll in the park and enjoy the cool breeze. If you have the opportunity, you can also follow your fathers and brothers into the swimming pool to learn to swim. Of course, families with good conditions can also have iced drinks. Needless to say for those living in the countryside, it is fun to catch fireflies and put them in eggshells; it is fun to catch dragonflies; it is fun to catch fish and shrimp; it is fun to lead cows to take a cold bath; and you don't have to wear clothes, even if you wear them, you only wear shorts and a small sweat towel, it is really refreshing!</p>
<p>No matter what you say, no matter what different comparisons you make, summer is always our children's season; if you don't believe it, then you just have to see, in summer, aren't adults all drowsy? Aren't children all lively?</p>
<p>However, although we are happy in summer, we must also prevent extreme joy from turning into sorrow. First, unclean things cannot be eaten to avoid the spread of diseases. Second, you should also learn some knowledge of industry, commerce, or agriculture from your fathers and brothers, and don't waste your precious time.</p>

<p>— Zhang Nancun</p>
<p>Hai'er saw the firefly light flickering and felt it was very strange, so he asked his mother: "It is unique among animals that fireflies can emit light. The flickering situation is like an electrical discharge in the air. I wonder if it can discharge electricity?"</p>
<p>Mother said: "It is not electricity. The firefly has a light-emitting organ at the end of its tail. When breathing, air enters, and a biochemical reaction occurs, so it flashes on and off. If there was electricity, wouldn't people get an electric shock if they caught a firefly? It lays its eggs on aquatic plants in summer. Fireflies gather more near the water than elsewhere. Therefore, there is the idiom 'rotten grass turns into fireflies.' Scholars in ancient times were diligent and studied by the light of fireflies in pouches at night, which is praised as a good story. In the past, when Emperor Yang of Sui traveled to Yangzhou via the Grand Canal, he ordered the people along the way to catch countless fireflies and present them to him. At night, he released them on both sides of the river. Thousands of groups flew in the trees, like 'fire trees and silver flowers,' which was very beautiful. He really came up with this playful idea, but Emperor Yang of Sui was extravagant and dissolute, and soon he was 'killed and the country was destroyed.'"</p>
<p>Hai'er asked again: "Light can generate heat, and biochemical reactions require burning. Why doesn't it burn and die?"</p>
<p>Mother said: "There is liquid contained in the firefly's tail. The water in the liquid combines with light gas, which does not support combustion, so there is no danger of burning. This is its physiological function."</p>
<p>Hai'er asked again: "If fireflies don't discharge electricity, are there any other benefits?"</p>
<p>Mother said: "Fireflies and their larvae eat all kinds of pests, which is beneficial to agriculture. Don't swat them with a fan when you see them. Let them fly freely and work to eliminate pests for farmers, which is also a virtue of 'cherishing things.'"</p>
<h3 id="e290">Summer Games <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Ding He</p>
<p>In summer, because the sun is very hot on the body, many children hide in their houses and don't go out to play. But isn't it too lonely to sit in the house?</p>
<p>Yes, because you children are too lonely, so I will tell you about several games to play in the summer, and they are all very interesting. Try playing according to the following methods, is it very interesting?</p>
<p>Flying Bubbles Playing this game is best in two locations, one, under an electric fan. One, in the sunlight, because these two places can increase your interest in playing.</p>
<p>Before starting the game, prepare a bowl or a bottle, and a wheat straw or a bamboo pen holder. Put half a bowl of water in the bowl, add some soap shavings to the water, and stir it with chopsticks until the soap shavings disappear, then you can start playing this game.</p>
<p>The method of playing is to hold one end of the wheat straw in your mouth and extend the other end into the bowl. As soon as the end extending into the bowl touches the water, take it out, and then gently blow on the end held in your mouth. A very small bubble will appear on the other end of the straw, and slowly become bigger, then it will fall off the end of the straw and float in the air. When there is wind, it can also fly up and down.</p>
<p>If you play this game under an electric fan, it can fly back and forth, up and down. If you play it in the sunlight, it will become colorful bubbles.</p>
<p>Finding the Doll First, I want to tell you that you only need two people to play this game, dividing who is A and who is B.</p>
<p>Now, let A find it for B first: A's right middle finger represents the doll, A's left hand tightly grips A's right fingers, only revealing the fingertip, but A must make it so that B can't tell which one is the doll and which one isn't, and then let B find it.</p>
<p>B finds the doll among the five fingers. Once B finds it, B uses their finger to pinch the doll tightly, and tells A to open their left hand to see if B has found it or not. If B found it, A loses and B wins. A opens their hand for B to hit their palm. While hitting, B sings the following song:</p>
<p>"Find the doll, look for the doll, the doll is lost in the big river. Cannot scoop it out, cannot climb up; the doll cries and says, I will hit your palm thirty-six times: one, two, three, four, five..."</p>
<p>If B doesn't find it and picks the wrong one, then switch and let B do it for A, and continue in this way.</p>
<p>P&gt;Children's Science Lecture: Terrible Mosquitoes and Flies</p>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>Summer has arrived, the weather is hot, and terrible mosquitoes and flies are everywhere. Little friends, do you all think they are terrible? Yes, they are pests. But does everyone know where their harm lies? What methods can be used to get rid of them? I will now briefly tell you.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes hatch in sewage, warmed by the sun and hatched into "larvae." (Figure 1) When they shed their skin and their bodies become curved, they become pupae (Figure 2). Then, when they grow legs and wings, the pupa splits the line in the center of its back, and the mosquito flies out. (Figure 3) Male mosquitoes eat grass juice, and female mosquitoes suck human blood. We hate them very much, and after they suck the blood of patients, they spread diseases to us. There is also a type of malarial mosquito, which always points its tail upwards when it rests. (Figure 4) It is the medium for spreading malaria (chills and fever), and it is even more hateful.</p>
<p>Fly eggs are produced in rotten food, and become maggots, which are larvae, overnight. (Figure 5) After ten days, they shed their skin, shrink inside, become oval, and become pupae. (Figure 6) After another three to several days, they grow wings and feet, break out of the shell, and become flies. (Figure 7) Its habits are that it likes dirt. It has three pairs of legs, and each leg grows countless fine hairs. Each fine hair on each leg can hold at least one million microorganisms, so if we eat food that flies have gathered on, we will definitely have a stomachache or diarrhea, because it brings the germs from its feet to our food.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes and flies are our enemies. They can make us sick, even die, so we should find ways to kill them. The method of extermination is fundamentally cleanliness, such as eliminating sewage and dirt, cleaning utensils, etc. If mosquitoes and flies have already been found, mosquito coils, flypaper, fly swatters, fly traps, etc. can be used to exterminate them. (Figure 8) Flypaper is made by frying rosin, tung oil, and honey and applying them to thick hemp paper. The method of making a fly swatter is also very simple. Prepare lead gauze, bamboo strips, and lead wire, and you can make it as shown in (Figure 9).</p>

<p>— Bo Zhen</p>
<p>The sunspots are gradually shrinking, and the heat is increasing day by day, always hovering around 100 degrees on the thermometer.</p>
<p>Little friends, are you bored at home? When you want to go out and play, your parents don't allow you to go out, fearing that the scorching sun will damage your body. It can be seen that parents' love for their children is so profound!</p>
<p>Reading and writing at home for two or three hours is enough. If you read and write too much, your brain will become dizzy. How should you spend the remaining time?</p>
<p>Now is an era of scientific prosperity, and you should do some scientific toys to play with to suit the trend. I can introduce you to:</p>
<p>(1) Periscope:</p>
<p>Materials: wooden boards, glass, saw, ruler, pencil.</p>
<p>Method: First saw the wooden board into a cube about eight inches long and two inches wide. Open a square hole two inches away from each end. At the same time, apply ink to the two pieces of glass and fit them exactly in the center of the square holes, forming an angle of about 45 degrees, and it is done. (As shown in Figure 1)</p>
<p>How to play: Extend the top of the mirror out of the corner of the wall or the gap in the door. Aim the square hole at the top of the mirror at the destination you want to peek at, and then look at the glass through the square hole at the bottom of the mirror, and you can see the things outside in the glass.</p>
<p>Two Sailing Boat:</p>
<p>Materials: wooden board, bamboo chopsticks, card paper, saw, pencil, ruler, nails, scissors, thread.</p>
<p>Method: Take a piece of wooden board five or six inches long, two or three inches wide, and four or five minutes thick. Saw one end into a pointed head and the other end into a round shape. Use a long piece of wood as the keel and nail it to the bottom of the boat. Nail a nail on the keel to give the boat a center of gravity so that it can be stable. At the same time, use two bamboo chopsticks to make a mast, and punch two small holes in the hull. Insert the mast into the two small holes. At the same time, cut out four rectangular pieces of card paper and thread them onto the bamboo mast as sails, and it is done. (As shown in Figure 2)</p>
<p>Little friends, if you want it to move forward by itself without relying on wind power. Then just saw the round end into a concave shape, put a piece of cowhide tendon on the left and right ends of the concave shape, and then saw a piece of wood smaller than the concave shape, embed it in the middle of the cowhide tendon, wind the small piece of wood tightly, and put it in the water, and it can move forward by splashing water. (As shown in Figure 3)</p>
<p>How to play: Put it in a narrow and long water swamp, and when a gust of wind blows, the sailboat will proceed very steadily and quickly.</p>

<p>"What country are we people from?" the teacher asked on the podium.</p>
<p>"Chinese, Chinese..." we answered like this.</p>
<p>"Then shouldn't we use Chinese goods?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!"</p>
<p>"Why?" the teacher asked again.</p>
<p>"We are Chinese, and Chinese people should love China. If you love China, you should love to use Chinese goods!" Aihua stood up and said:</p>
<p>Everyone applauded, and the teacher nodded.</p>
<p>"The imperialist countries bring goods to our China in exchange for our money. We give them the money, and we are getting weaker day by day, and they are getting richer day by day. If this continues, our country will perish, and we will be slaves to a conquered country!" I stood up again and said.</p>
<p>"Then we shouldn't use foreign goods!" the teacher said.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!" we answered.</p>
<p>"But don't many of the things you use still not made in China?"</p>
<p>Our faces all turned red. Looking at our clothes, looking at the pencils and paper we were using, Aihua was so ashamed that she cried!</p>
<p>"Don't worry, don't cry! Since we know our mistakes, we shouldn't make them again. Even saints make mistakes! As long as we are brave enough to correct our mistakes, we will be good Chinese students, good Chinese students who love China. From today onwards, let us unanimously use Chinese goods!" "From today onwards, we will only use Chinese goods!" We swore:</p>

<p>(5) These are children from Siberia. Siberia is in the north of Asia. The weather is very cold. The children there wear very thick leather clothes and hats and do all kinds of games on the snow to keep warm.</p>
<p>(6) These are children from Mongolia in our country. They live in a place with many deserts. They like to live a pastoral life, so they are good at riding horses and are very strong.</p>
<p>(7) These children were born in the Ryukyu Islands, and were originally our compatriots, but later Japan snatched the Ryukyus. Now they are small slaves of the Japanese. Children! We must aspire to help them escape from the sea of suffering.</p>
<p>(8) Children, do you know this child? They are Japanese, and from an early age they have received a robber-like education, preparing to rob the places of weak nations when they grow up. Children, be prepared and resist them!</p>

<h3 id="e295">No Special Changes in the Gold Market Yet <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>The degree of silver price decline is also slight. The gold market was extremely stable yesterday, with a rather firm mid-day situation. The market situation was slightly dazed for half a day, with a lot of head-scratching and a lack of special changes. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US were flat. The futures silver prices on the Five Metals Exchange, except for the September contract, were reduced by one to three and a half cents. Exchange rate fluctuations were slight. London gold rose by half a penny. US cotton fell by 31 pounds. US wheat was reduced by two cents. The degree of silver price decline was not satisfactory. In addition, the large traders said that US demand was extremely strong, so the initial opening of the goods market retreated to 87.8 yuan. However, the sentiment did not turn weak, and the price rebounded after the low. The pre-market trading opened steadily and then stood outside the 90 yuan mark. Although it rose after the opening, the banks were still congested and hovering. It was learned that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing was flat in both the UK and the US. It rose and fell once. When the bank strongly sought forward US dollars, there were many buyers in the market. The large traders bought vigorously. It was heard that speculator Wu also made up for his position. At this time, the situation was the most bullish, but there were also many sellers taking advantage of the high price, so it hesitated for a long time, hovering outside the 2 yuan range. Later, the banks collectively sold the recent US exchange rate, and the gold market gradually declined. The domestic market also loosened slightly, and eventually broke the 90 yuan mark. However, the night market silver price was reported to have shrunk by 125, or no change, and 125 news. There were still many buyers taking advantage of the low price, and the price was pulled up by about 2 yuan again. However, the bank's appetite was still to buy far and sell near, and the tendency to tighten was still lurking. The morning closing price was succumbed within the 90 yuan range.

The exchange market opened with recent-term selling prices: sterling at 1 shilling 4 1/8 pence, the dollar at 33.875 yuan, both flat compared to the previous closing. The situation remained flat after opening, with banks actively buying forward-term dollars, tightening the process. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's (HSBC) posted rates showed sterling and the dollar remaining flat. Banks then sold near-term contracts. After entering, the banks' appetite stabilized. There was a lack of change in buying far and selling near. Subsequently, continued selling of near-term contracts loosened the situation, but because the Seattle overnight silver price fell by 0.125, the process became extremely flat. By noon, the near-term selling prices were sterling at 1 shilling 4 1/8 pence and the dollar at 33.875 yuan. Compared to the previous close, sterling and the dollar showed no difference.

Yesterday, being the weekend, most banks were only open for half a day, making the market even more sluggish. The interbank lending rate opened at 5%, unchanged for many days.

<p>Yesterday, the small foreign coin market was weak due to sluggish trading. Jiangnan small coins were the same in both the morning and afternoon markets, weakening due to sluggish trading.

<h3 id="e299">Why So Many Rumors About '96' Speculation <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rumor of halting trading occurred again. Initially opening at 11 yuan. Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market initially rumored that '96' would halt futures trading in September. Knowing this to be a baseless rumor, people were still shaken. Everyone expected '96' to have a major fall, with a huge difference compared to the off-market trading at 20 yuan on the 9th of this month. Therefore, all other varieties also became weak due to the nervous sentiment. Bulls rushed to sell, causing market prices to drop slightly. Yesterday's opening saw large accounts still dominating the buying side, but heavy selling by retail investors gradually made it impossible to stabilize. After entering, it became increasingly sluggish. Consolidated taxes fell sharply by seven jiao. '96' had rumors, and because bulls were switching positions, the initial July trading was only at 11 yuan, a sharp drop of 1.85 yuan. The reporter predicted a return to the original price and was unfortunately proven right. After this, short covering rose, gradually raising it to 12.3 yuan. The difference between the highest and lowest prices in the same session was a huge 1.3 yuan, showing the chaotic situation. Forward market prices were down 0.6 jiao, and before closing, they continued to fall 0.1-0.2 jiao. Starting from the 20th series, they gradually rose, mostly rising by 0.3-0.5 jiao. The future will have a reactive market result. Continuing to fall 0.2-0.3 yuan to about half a yuan. The 23rd series fell by one yuan. The total transaction volume was 18,220,000 yuan. The resulting increase and decrease are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>According to the Wall Street Journal market report from Sin Fung Trading Company, yesterday (20th), the New York stock market was active, with prices falling. The U.S. government will issue hundreds of millions of yuan in new bonds in September for debt exchange purposes. This proves that the dollar will not be devalued, and there is no plan for new silver inflation at present. Inflationary sentiment has therefore reduced. Progress was only slightly seen before closing. The small exchange market also fell due to reduced inflationary sentiment. The bond market fluctuated. U.S. public bonds showed slight discrepancies, and German public bonds loosened. Chicago wheat fell because a certain report stated that the government's estimate of winter wheat was too low. The total daily trading volume was 1.24 million shares. Furthermore, according to our New York agent's report, (securities) railway stocks fell due to poor railway freight reports, and metal stocks were weak, leading to a general weakness in the stock market. (Grains) Bulls sold off, but the heat has not subsided, and the outlook is for higher prices. (Cotton) Yesterday's market was weak, partly because there was a possibility of rainfall in the cotton-producing areas, and bulls routinely sold off at the weekend. Other markets were weak. Furthermore, news said that the amount of foreign cotton planting was large, and there was increasing doubt about the amount of damage to cotton crops to date. Local yarn factories in Alabama are still intermittently on strike. (Rubber) The market is calm, and the main markets remain firm, higher than New York parity. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>American cotton fell again, and bulls took some profits. The yarn market continues to weaken and is in a state of depression. Due to the fall in American cotton, people's hearts softened, and there were fewer receivers this month, making the market more relaxed. Distant months were weak. The financial world has taken some of its large-amount profits, but most buyers still want to see higher prices, with fewer shipments from yarn mills. However, current yarn sales have turned cold again.</p>
<h3 id="e303">Recent-Term Fall of One Yuan <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the Shanghai yarn market was weak, with the opening price falling due to American cotton falling by 31 points per pound. There was a lack of buyers in the market. Near-term contracts fell by 1.63 yuan, and distant-term contracts fell by 0.78 yuan. Traded until the 23rd session. Due to the firm rise in the cotton market, the market gradually rebounded by several jiao. However, there was weak demand for current yarn from customer groups, and some financial bulls took profits. However, there were also many shorts covering. Closing prices rebounded by 0.1-0.2 yuan, resulting in an increase of 0.4-1 yuan in various months. The total transaction volume was 32,700 bales. Sales: Tongfu 400 bales, Meiji 500 bales, Dafeng 1,300 bales, Suilong 1,550 bales, Yuanda 650 bales, Mingde 3,250 bales, Shenchang 1,250 bales, Yuanda 600 bales, Shenji 600 bales, Runkang 950 bales, and Xincheng 1,250 bales.

<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose, with the situation slightly turning stable. However, American cotton turned back down. Generally, short sellers covered during the decline, so there were more buyers, and the market tended to rise. There were also rumors of bull companies, so the August contract rose even more. However, with rain in the cotton-producing areas, the Han group observed that the cotton production situation was good, so they sold short on the rise.</p>
<h3 id="e306">Zheng Biao (鄭標) Fell and Rose Again <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the Shanghai Cotton Exchange (標棉) market was quite weak. Due to the sharp fall of 31 points per pound in American cotton, people’s hearts turned bearish, and buyers in the market decreased, softening the market sentiment. Prices for all months fell by 0.2-0.15 yuan. After trading to the second session, large purchases by Dachang (大昶) and Huikang (惠康) suddenly tightened the market, and there were rumors of a newly organized bull company for the August contract, which also stirred up the distant months. At the third closing, prices gradually rose. Some reported that customs hung up warning balloons (驚球, meaning hurricane warnings) and that a hurricane would soon strike Shanghai. Retail investors rushed to cover, so the market rose sharply. As a result, old cotton rose 0.15-0.4 yuan, and new cotton rose 0.1-0.3 yuan. The total traded was 100,970 dan. Sales: Yifeng (益豐) 5,500 dan, Xinting (新亭) 3,500 dan, Deji (德記) 2,000 dan, Xincheng (信誠) 2,100 dan, Changfeng (長豐) 3,000 dan, Yichang (益昶) 2,800 dan, Taichang (泰昌) 1,600 dan, Changyu (長餘) 1,500 dan, Shenchang (愼昌) 1,400 dan, Zhenda (振大) 2,500 dan, Yuanda (源大) 6,600 dan, Suilong (穗隆) 3,000 dan, Tongfu (同孚) 1,000 dan, and Dafu (大孚) 1,600 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, but later became greatly depressed due to bull profit-taking and manufacturer disappointment. As a result, spot prices fell by 28 points per pound, and futures fell by 24-31 points per pound. British cotton futures fell by 7-8 points. The Indian cotton market was sluggish and uncharacteristic. Bengal and Oomra were unchanged, and Broach fell by 1.5 rupees. Original telegrams are recorded on the left (telegram dated 20th):</p>

<h3 id="e309">Many Opportunities for Flour Prices to Rise <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there have been movements in the northern Manchuria water situation… Tianjin and Yingkou are taking action</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, foreign wheat quotations showed a fall of 0.6 jiao in Chicago and about 0.5 jiao in Canada. Moreover, this port continued to see timely rain, which was quite sufficient. Therefore, after the opening prices, the prices of each month had slightly retreated by 0.5-1 fen compared to the previous day. However, the market sentiment remained firm, mainly because the northern Manchuria area was suffering from flooding, and the demand for flour was feared to increase step by step. Therefore, groups from Yingkou, Andong, and Tianjin kept buying actively. This month, because there were spot goods available for drawing, buying was even more intense. Therefore, after the second session, the market for each month rebounded again. The reason for this rise was first due to the great drought, which led to outside traders actively hoarding, and then the great flood in northern Manchuria, which led to actual sales. Therefore, although foreign wheat was quoted lower, and timely rain continued to fall, the turbulent flood ultimately failed to relieve the urgent need. Subsequent observations indicate that since the trend has no entered a regular pattern, there is bound to be a continuing risk of further rise. As a result, this month's rose another 0.4 fen, August's rose 0.2 fen, September's rose 0.075 fen, and October to December's rose 0.2 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e310">Wheat Futures Buyers in Strong Force <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning, the markets for each month initially fell and then rose. Foreign wheat quotations retreated by varying degrees of 0.5-0.6 jiao, and the tense situation inevitably eased, as timely rain was received everywhere. Therefore, the opening prices for each month fell by varying degrees of 0.1-0.3 fen compared to the previous day. Later, because the flour market recovered from sluggishness to briskness, and outside large accounts actively purchased again, the markets after the opening became brisk again. Although the rising trend was not as strong as the previous day, the transactions for each month were exceptionally brisk. Subsequent observations indicate that natural disasters of floods and droughts continue to prevail, and the feared deterioration in the future is easily incited by speculators. As a result, this month was unchanged, August improved by 0.5 fen, September to November improved by 0.4 fen, and December improved by 0.6 fen. The spot wheat market received continuous arrivals, and sales were also brisk, generally being sold as soon as they arrived and unable to accumulate. Prices were better by 0.2-0.3 fen compared to the previous day. Open prices: Mingguang, Suzhou, and Bengbu wheat at 3.37 yuan, Linhuai guan wheat at 3.38 yuan, Hefei wheat at 3.17 yuan, Qingjiang wheat at 3.35 yuan, Shandong wheat at 3.4 yuan, Liuhe wheat at 3.25 yuan, Gaotong wheat at 3.33 yuan, Taizhou wheat at 3.32 yuan, Jiangjiaba wheat at 3.36 yuan, Yangzhou wheat at 3.33 yuan, Gaoyou wheat at 3.25 yuan, and Bianjiang wheat at 3.13 yuan. Fuxin took away 10,000 bags, Shenda took away 4,000 bags, Fubu took away 5,000 bags, and Xinda took away 1,000 bags.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of various groups totaled 16-17 houses (goods totaling 2,200-2,300 shi). The market situation at noon seemed to have turned around, and yesterday the road out of this street was more brisk, with strong dealings. The market shape was tight, moving upwards and without any setback. Thus, the overall situation showed a reversal of the previous downturn. Late rice such as Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, etc., although the bao wei (包胃, meaning forward sales) had not moved, the price of fresh and high-quality goods had already recovered by 0.2 yuan. The common groups such as Su and Tongnan Port had digestion of 0.3-0.4 yuan. Duyangjian (杜洋尖) followed, bringing up the light by 0.2 yuan. Only Bian Yinyuan (變陰元) was without honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than ten houses of sources from various routes in Hexia. Due to the overcast and rainy weather, the sales of various colors in the market were scarce, and the roads were deserted. High-quality white rice had fixed prices, and middle and lower prices added 0.1-0.2 yuan. Early Bo rice was the same. Yang Dupu and Kejian (羊杜埠客尖) were tight.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market situation for foreign Indica rice was such that, due to gradually decreasing arrivals recently, production areas were either unwilling to transport because of rising prices, or hoarders were optimistic and unwilling to sell. Stocks in Yangdapu were also depleted. The price of small grade rice rose sharply by another ten cents. The price of both milled and unpolished Indica rice increased by five cents to ten cents each. The whole city opened with 360 bags of milled Jing rice, over 2,000 bags of various unpolished rice, and 2,000 bags of small grade rice, totaling just over 4,000 bags, which were handled by businesses from the local mainland.</p>
<p>Soybean Sales are Particularly Brisk</p>
<h3 id="e313">Hankou Light Green Beans Open at 2.95 Yuan <a href="#e313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>Recently, soybean sales have been particularly strong in this area, followed by the mainland. Furthermore, continuous rain has boosted confidence, so the high soybean market, facing scarce inventory, is steadily rising. Yesterday, Zhengyangguan beans were already priced at 3.19 yuan, a further increase of seven cents. Goods from the interior were also affected. The city saw transactions of eight to nine cartloads of various beans. However, businesses such as factories remain temporarily inactive. The price of Jiujiang Xinchengmen beans also increased, with a price range of 3.08 yuan to 3.05 yuan. A total of over 500 bags were sold, handled by Ningbo merchants from the local mainland. The first batch of over 100 bags of Hankou light green beans opened yesterday at a price of 2.95 yuan, handled by Yong merchants. It is also reported that several dozen bags arrived earlier and were distributed by brokers to Yong merchants at a price of 3.10 yuan.</p>

<p>New silk from Sichuan and Hankou has been on the market for a while, but transportation to Shanghai is not smooth. For convenience, Sichuan silk merchants generally pack the silk into postal packages and send them to Shanghai through the post office. Since the new silk season began, only slightly more than 600 packages have arrived.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market in the foreign firms in this port saw strong demand for precious eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, Shexian, and other areas. British firms such as Jinlong, Xiehe, and Tianxiang, as well as the China Tea Company, were all very interested. A total of over 1,300 boxes were traded, and the market was not quiet. However, the opening prices showed that high-grade goods from the northern Wuyuan route opened at 110 yuan, and goods from Tunxi opened at 96 to 97 yuan. Compared to the average price of goods, these were down four to five yuan. In addition, there were sporadic transactions of Pingshui pearl tea and black tea from the two Hubei provinces and Wenzhou. The market showed little fluctuation.</p>
<h3 id="e316">Oil Market: White Tung Oil, Supposed to Sell Well, Isn't Selling <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>Tung oil is normally a fast-selling item in the summer. However, due to foreign firms’ demand, white tung oil sales continue throughout the year, so there's no distinction between peak and off-seasons. Recently, foreign firms in Hankou have slightly reduced their purchases, and the selling price has fallen to 28.60 or 28.70 yuan. Although the market appears weak, prices are not expected to fall much further. Therefore, the price of Xiangtung oil from Hankou remains around 24 yuan. Generally, if foreign firms do not resume purchases, prices may stabilize. However, if there are large-scale transactions, prices will likely rise again. Thus, the market for white tung oil is fluctuating. The situation for domestic-selling Hongxiu tung oil is different. The prolonged drought has had a significant impact. Farmers are busy working in the fields, constantly drawing water for irrigation, and have no time to pay attention to painting utensils. As a result, the sale of Hong oil is not happening during the season, due to the weather. Fortunately, the production of Hongjiang oil this year has been greatly reduced, so even though sales are sluggish, the market has been able to maintain itself. Seeing the small production volume earlier, those engaged in this business were worried about shortages during the sales season. But they have unexpectedly been spared by the drought, allowing them to cope adequately. Recently, prices remain unchanged: Jichang and Zheng Hong are at 28 yuan per barrel, Jiyingfeng at 26.8 yuan, and deputy Hong Yang Hengyuan Qingyuanfeng at 24 yuan. Jifeng Yingtong Taifeng is at 23.40 or 23.50 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e317">What is the Significance of Anglo-French Cooperation? <a href="#e317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Ming</p>
<p>Not long ago, the diplomatic authorities of Britain and France clashed head-on over the issue of "security guarantees" in Geneva, causing the disarmament conference to virtually stall and the European situation to become frozen. Shortly thereafter, French Foreign Minister Barthou suddenly visited London, and immediately the news of Anglo-French cooperation was released. Consequently, Britain and Italy agreed to the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, and the Soviet Union will join the League of Nations within two weeks. The changes in the European situation have become a major issue in current international politics.</p>
<p>We know that politicians in London have always disliked any country vying with them for hegemony in Europe. Before the European War, because of Germany's expanding power, which threatened Britain's position as leader everywhere, Britain had to ally with France and Russia to counter the rising Germany. After the war, Germany's armed forces were disarmed, its colonies were seized, and it had lost the ability to compete with Britain for hegemony. At the same time, on the other hand, France, with the Versailles system, eyed Europe covetously. The expansion of its army, navy, and air force, the increase in its economic power, and the rise of its political status all made the British Empire feel uneasy. Therefore, "boosting Germany and suppressing France" became the center of Britain's post-war foreign policy in Europe. Recently, due to Franco-Soviet amity, German-Polish cooperation, the alliance between Italy, Austria, and Hungary, and the meeting between the French and Italian prime ministers in Venice, the tangled diplomatic policies and collusive relationships among European countries have become concretely evident. Under these circumstances, if Franco-Soviet relations become increasingly friendly, and the small countries of the Baltic and Balkan regions further protect them, London would naturally feel uneasy. At the same time, the closeness between Italy and Germany has the potential to develop into the realization of a Central European alliance, which also poses a threat to Britain. Moreover, Italy's recent expansion of its navy and construction of warships is something that Britain, which prides itself on being the master of the seas, can hardly sit idly by and watch. Therefore, in order to ease Anglo-French conflict and prevent various possible crises, London's diplomats have had to superficially change their past foreign policy. Thus, Barthou's trip to London was not in vain, and temporary Anglo-French cooperation became a reality.</p>
<p>However, to say that Britain and France have completely understood each other from now on, and that the European situation has moved towards peace, is still inconsistent with objective facts. The main manifestation of the so-called Anglo-French cooperation is Britain's recognition of France's security guarantee plan and its support for the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, which is not enough to say that Britain and France have reached complete understanding in all aspects. Moreover, France's security guarantee plan, the so-called Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, is actually aimed at preventing Germany. However, London is linking German military equality with security guarantees, meaning that on the one hand, it supports the Paris plan to make Germany comply to a certain extent and return to Geneva in order to ease Anglo-French conflict, and on the other hand, it supports Germany's rearmament to counter France. At the same time, Italy, which is changing its attitude along with Britain, has more specifically stated: "Italy does not oppose the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact for three reasons: (1) Italy is certain that this pact is not directed against Germany; (2) Italy believes that this pact recognizes Germany's right to military equality; (3) ......" From this, it can be seen that even on the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, Britain, France, Italy, and other countries all have their own hidden agendas, and their opinions are not unified. Recently, a section of the French press has expressed great dissatisfaction with British Foreign Secretary Simon's remarks, even declaring that they "felt as if they had a nightmare" after hearing Simon's remarks. At the same time, Barthou also formally stated: "If anyone asks me to provide the conditions for establishing the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact after hearing Simon's remarks, then I cannot agree." This is the beginning of the expression of Anglo-French differences. Therefore, we can say that Britain and France have reached a temporary agreement on the surface, but it would be a mistake to say that they have completely understood each other, let alone that the European situation has moved towards peace.</p>
<p>As for the fundamental contradictions between Germany and France, France and Italy, Germany, Austria, and Italy, and even Britain and France, they have not only not been resolved, but are also developing. The ultimate solution to these contradictions is war. Before the outbreak of war, that is, before the imperialist powers are fully prepared for war, they have no choice but to use various methods to ease their real contradictions in order to practically prepare for war. The significance of the so-called Anglo-French cooperation, and even Franco-Italian understanding, is nothing more than this. In the future, the development path of Europe and even the world may be very tortuous on the surface, but it must have a general goal, which is to move towards war. This is what we can assert.</p>

<h3 id="e318">Under the Mercury Lamp <a href="#e318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<p>— Youqun</p>
<p>The lives of movie stars, as depicted in today's newspapers and magazines, often touch only on the surface of luxury and happiness. The underlying layers of hard work and tears hidden behind those words are often missed by the clever pens of those contributors. In reality, it's difficult to indulge in luxurious and happy dreams in the movie circle. Those who make a living under the mercury lamp are definitely not a group of happy people. The lives of movie stars are definitely not as ideal and beautiful as many people imagine. They are just puppets of labor, like employees in other industrial sectors.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that some people see becoming a star as their greatest fantasy, the reality under the mercury lamp shatters their daydreams. Here, I must first point out that this is not an ideal occupation. We may as well start with the aspect of treatment. Everyone knows how surprisingly disparate the treatment of stars is. For example, in China, the most popular actress can earn about 20,000 yuan a year, while the monthly income of a well-known actor rarely exceeds 300 yuan. It is not surprising for an ordinary actress with some fame to receive 300, 400, 500, or 600 yuan per month from the company. No matter how much the boss promotes him, it is very difficult for such an actor to get more than 200 yuan from the boss's pocket. No matter how much acting talent you have, even if your talent is sufficient to play the leading role in the film and you have been assigned to play the leading role, it is difficult for you to earn more than 30 yuan per month as a male actor who is new to the screen. This kind of unfair treatment of these "new" stars often causes an inexplicable indignation in the person concerned. They must constantly be thinking of ways to get rid of this cage. But on the one hand, the harsh reality of life makes them have to work hard to maintain this "position", and wish they could sign longer-term contracts with the bosses. Can we say anything to blame this contradiction in life?</p>
<p>This unequal treatment has opened up a road for film companies to find new talents. In order to guarantee the future success of their business, the bosses are willing to pay more to poach those who are frustrated with their meager salaries from their business competitors. Their generosity and generosity are sometimes astonishing. They are willing to increase the salaries of their employees by double or more than two-thirds. Some people who have played leading roles may only receive 60 yuan per month in their original company, but another company will buy his (or her) labor for 100 yuan a month, and yet another company will even use 120 yuan to ask him or her to help out. (This is just an example. The salaries of more famous stars are even higher. She may only get more than 200 yuan per month in the original company, but another company may hire her for 300 or 400 yuan.) Of course, those who have the qualifications to be snatched up by others are unwilling to sign long-term contracts with the bosses. A one-year contract is considered the most suitable for them or her.</p>

<h3 id="e319">Discussing China's Current Grain Problem from the Soaring Price of Rice <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— Katayama</p>
<p>For the past month, due to the drought, not only have the old farmers felt all kinds of hardships, but also the small and medium-sized bourgeoisie in the cities have similarly recognized a huge crisis. Let's not talk about anything else, but just take the most important food problem in our "clothing, food, housing", half a month ago, the top grade white rice was only worth 9.2 yuan per bag, but recently (15th), its price has soared to 12.8 yuan; in just half a month, it has risen by 5.6 yuan in a row.</p>
<p>Those who eat top-grade white rice are mostly the relatively wealthy class. Our working friends are very lucky if they can eat second-grade white rice or Pinghu white japonica rice: but even the lowest Pinghu rice has risen from 8.2 yuan on June 28 to 10.6 yuan on the 15th. Under such circumstances, coupled with the harsh weather, it is as the newspaper said recently: "The common people cannot live."</p>
<p>The soaring price of rice is a fact, and the manipulation of merchants is also a fact; but these facts are only temporary phenomena. Outside of this temporary phenomenon, there is a fundamental problem. Now let's talk about this fundamental problem.</p>
<p>China is an ancient country that is based on agriculture. Before the sea ban was lifted, although it sometimes had to rely slightly on Siam, Taiwan, and other places due to natural disasters, in general, it was still able to be self-sufficient: but since the Republic of China, this "self-sufficiency" has gradually been broken. Domestic rice is increasingly insufficient for self-use, while foreign rice is flowing in like a tide. Regarding the situation of foreign rice imports, please see the following table:</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 1: 2,700,493 Dan</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 5: 11,284,025</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 10: 10,634,560</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 15: 18,720,777</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 20: 10,740,810</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 23: 21,423,091</p>
<p>Look, an annual leakage of 20 million dan and a deficit of 150 million yuan. In a country that is based on agriculture, this phenomenon is appalling!</p>
<p>However, please do not sigh at this number: now let's investigate the reasons for this matter.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that when the imperialists used machine guns and cannons to conquer colonies or semi-colonies, what followed was economic aggression, which was based on the principle of absorbing the latter's raw materials and selling their own manufactured goods. However, when this kind of aggression reached a certain stage, because it destroyed all the economic foundations of the semi-colony, the latter not only needed the supply of manufactured goods from imperialism, but also had to rely on others for raw materials. China's current food problem is the most obvious example of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>In recent years, although the government has taken measures to increase the import tax on foreign rice, as a result of (1) the poor rice production in our country recently, (2) the inconvenience of transportation, and (3) the failure to abolish exorbitant taxes, the price of rice has instead been raised step by step.</p>
<p>This gradual upward trend is actually only deliberately manipulated by merchants and is of no benefit to the old farmers. Recently, rice merchants have used the drought as an excuse to raise the price of rice by one-half in just half a month, which is a very serious problem for people's food!</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, it is absolutely not enough to simply increase import taxes. Only by further actively increasing rice production, developing transportation, earnestly abolishing exorbitant taxes, and strictly cracking down on merchants' speculation and manipulation can we relieve our current disaster!</p>
<p>Regarding contracts, I might as well say a few more words. Those who hope to sign long-term contracts are mostly actors who are new to the screen. They are content to allow the company boss to have full control over the freedom of their bodies for a uniform price of 20 yuan, 30 yuan, or at most 50 yuan per month for three or five years. They or she initially thought that this was a not a small sum, and were fortunate that their own and their families' lives were guaranteed; who knows, most of those who sell their labor at such a low price are very intelligent and talented people (especially female stars). Once they appear on the screen and meet the audience, they will immediately cause a sensation and be recognized as a bright star, but her or his salary is still at the level of an unknown person. She or he never expected to have such a lucky day. She or he may feel remorse in her heart for the previous excessive concern for life security. Now that the boss has filled his pockets because of her or him, she or he is embarrassed not to take out a small part of the profit and automatically increase her or his salary by 20 or 30 yuan per month, or distribute this money as "reward money" to those who are not very successful but have talent.</p>
<p>What I said above refers to the official or "basic" actors of each company. In addition, there is an actor who does have certain talents and is suitable for the role of a certain special person in a certain script, but he is not necessarily suitable for the general needs of a certain company. In this way, he can only be hired by the boss for a short period of time. This is the so-called "guest" actor. Most of the "guest" actors have the contract stipulating the filming of a certain designated play. The minimum reward for "guest" acting in a play will not be less than 100; 150 yuan and 200 yuan are also available. However, it is rare to see 300 yuan for a play. The minimum time for filming a play will never be less than one or two months. It is not considered long to be three or four months in general, and it is not uncommon to be six or seven months, or eight or nine months.</p>
<p>In addition to the guest actors, there is also a kind of extra. Most of the extras are hired as "moving scenery". There are not many shots, and the position is not important, but they are indispensable. For example, art cannot be without an audience (many musicians are also often hired as extras), a church cannot be without prostitutes, and a factory cannot be without female workers ... Thus, a large number of extras are very necessary. Usually, the price of hard work for an extra for a day is one dollar, and some days you can earn a little more than one dollar. If there are dramas to be filmed every day, you can earn up to 40 yuan per month, which is more considerable than the income of a "new" or "　　" actor. (The monthly salary of a basic actor in a large movie company in Shanghai is only seven yuan!) But there are very, very few people who have such good luck.</p>
<p>Some of the extras are unemployed film workers, ordinary unemployed people, and hired prostitutes; some are people who rely on the position of "extra" to eat. There are also some curious gentlemen and ladies who take pleasure and pride in appearing on the screen and occasionally come out to show off in front of the audience.</p>
<p>The reason for the disparity in treatment of actors as mentioned above is said to be due to the difference in talent (?) and experience; but in the movie industry, there are people with insufficient talent and little experience who are also acting as gardeners. There is a kind of actor who specializes in using certain characteristics or defects on his body to eat. For example, Laurel and Hardy rely on their fat and thinness, and Buster Keaton relies on his "cold face", etc. Some Chinese film companies like to raise fat people, so "selling meat" has also become a profession. No matter how inconvenient obesity makes people move, but for a salary of 40 or 50 yuan a month, fat people have to eat more "pig brains", and make their bodies more dull, so as to win the audience's smile. There are also people who use their defects such as "squinting eyes" to appear in the so-called "gimmick" interlude shots to amuse the audience ... In short, there is nothing strange in the film industry, and I don’t have time to talk about it in detail here.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about the stars'</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>personal lives. Even a famous star cannot avoid often complaining about being poor. Most of their qualifications are only suitable for living in the more beautiful apartments in the area of ​​Xuhui District, and the suits are made for them by the stores in the area of ​​Wusong Road. In terms of meals, they may be regular customers of Russian restaurants, or they may also be in the humble position of a cook with the qualifications of a big star (naturally it cannot be generalized). What they are most heartbroken about is probably the company’s arrears of wages for several months in a row. The company sometimes decides the number of salaries based on whether a certain film is "popular" or not. If that film happens to be very "unpopular", then they are really unlucky. They will feel panic in all aspects.</p>
<p>However, some stars still have to waste their limited income. You can find them living a decadent life in the corners of the dance hall. Also, because of the liberation of men and women and the frequency of contact, a pair of lovers will be created at super speed. From this, pairs of people go to dance halls, swimming pools, movie theaters, cafes ... are all very ordinary.</p>
<p>Because of considerable waste, they have to dream of getting rich. In terms of their current situation, it is absolutely difficult for them to become "rich" like American stars, so some people harbor improper intentions, either buying aviation lottery tickets or buying champagne tickets for racecourses or Jai Alai courts, in order to get something for nothing. In order to "become famous", some people's "climbing the dragon" does not hesitate to go in the direction of depravity and crime. The rape cases of movie stars are not just seen once or twice.</p>
<p>In order to get the praise and promotion of bosses, directors, and people in the film industry, flattery and contribution of everything they own (female stars) is often a necessary means. Therefore, some self-respecting stars would rather jump out of this dark film circle and not be willing to go with the flow.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to point out that although many stars seem to live a luxurious life on the surface, they are not necessarily truly happy people. Ai Xia's suicide is a good example.</p>

<h3 id="e320">Mr. Liu Fu and the Chinese New Literature Movement <a href="#e320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Wen</p>
<p>According to reports, the literary figure Liu Fu passed away at 2:10 PM on the 14th of this month in Beiping. The news has been met with deep sorrow in academic circles. Furthermore, mourning articles by Mr. Shou Tonghe and Mr. Chen Zizhan have already appeared in the "Free Talk" section of this newspaper, offering a fair assessment of Mr. Liu's efforts in linguistics and his personal character. Now, in mourning for Mr. Liu, I specifically recount his relationship with the Chinese New Literature Movement, hoping to evoke a shared sentiment among everyone.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Funong was one of the main figures in the May Fourth Literary Revolution. At that time, Mr. Liu's opposition to the old classical Chinese and his advocacy for the new vernacular literature were, in many respects, even more proactive than those of Mr. Hu Shi. The revolutionary spirit expressed in his "My Views on Literary Reform" (published in "New Youth," Vol. 3, No. 3) can be considered a step further than Mr. Hu Shi's "Eight No's." This can be seen in his words: "…The term 'eliminate superstition' seems similar to Mr. Hu's two items of 'not imitating the ancients,' but it is actually a step further than Mr. Hu. Mr. Hu only says that the writings of the ancients should not be imitated, but I say that unless the dead form of ancient writing is overturned, the new literature will never be able to break away from the old literature's conventions. Most of the essays written by people today rigidly adhere to the four characters of 'beginning, development, turn, and conclusion,' which are as unbreakable as the 'tortoise head' and 'butterfly clip' terms of the eight-legged essay writers… If we want to build the foundation of a new literature, we must first break this superstition of worshiping the old literary forms, so that literature can quickly display a new brilliance in form…" As for how to reform prose and verse and how to resolve formal issues, Mr. Liu had very progressive opinions in this article.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu had a particular interest in poetry. In his article "Innovation in the Spirit of Poetry and Fiction" (published in "New Youth," Vol. 3, No. 5), he said: "The original intention of writing poetry is simply to express the truest point in one's thoughts using natural sounds and rhythms, and that is considered excellent." Such a correct view is probably something that those poets who only talk about flowers and the moon and do not pay attention to the "true" content of their thoughts will never understand. However, Mr. Liu expressed this as early as the May Fourth era, which cannot help but make us admire him. As for his attack on Confucianism in this article, it demonstrated an exceptionally bold spirit. He publicly declared that Confucius, who had been revered as a sage by the Chinese people for thousands of years, committed a heinous crime by abridging the "Book of Songs," saying that Confucius was "simply the greatest criminal in Chinese literature!"</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Liu not only made brilliant contributions to the theory of the New Literature Movement but also used vernacular language to create many new poems to counter classical Chinese writing. We can say that he was a theorist, a critic, and also a creator, a poet. His poems such as "Separated by a Layer of Paper" and "The Apprentice's Suffering" were all completed with a new consciousness and a new form. At that time, although Mr. Hu Shi and Mr. Shen Yinmo also wrote poems in vernacular Chinese, they were all confined by the form of old poetry, not daring to break the old rules and write poems in the form of prose. However, in "New Youth," Vol. 4, No. 5, Mr. Liu Fu began to experiment with "unrhymed poetry," and his "Selling Radishes" was one of the earliest "unrhymed poems" to appear in China.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Liu's poems not only had many shortcomings in form, but also were full of humanistic consciousness in content; from the current point of view, this is, of course, considered backward. However, under the general cultural level at that time, in such an enlightenment movement, I think it is still rare that Mr. Liu was able to create such works.</p>
<p>Just as the May Fourth Literary Revolution was not thorough, it goes without saying that there were also many non-thorough opinions in Mr. Liu's views on the New Literature Movement. But this responsibility cannot be entirely borne by Mr. Liu; the main person responsible should be Chinese society. Because under the social conditions of China at that time, only such a literary revolution could be produced, and only such opinions on the literary revolution as those of Mr. Liu and his contemporaries could be produced. Moreover, even if Mr. Liu had some non-thorough aspects, we cannot deny his achievements in the Chinese New Literature Movement because of this.</p>
<p>But now that Mr. Liu has passed away, apart from continuing the spirit of the May Fourth New Literature Movement and striving for a newer literary revolution, I am afraid we can only feel sorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e321">Agreement on Preventing Robbery of Postal Agency Businesses, "Pi Ju" and "Pi Yin" in Other Ports <a href="#e321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— He Henchen</p>
<p>Correspondence from Chaozhou</p>
<p>"Pi Ye," here, don't think it refers to the job of a senior official, holding a vermilion pen and writing "Approved" and "As Requested," or the "fortune-telling" career of a Jianghu fortune teller. "Pi Ju" is also not the yamen of an official or a fortune-telling hall. And "Pi Yin," at first glance, seems to be a term in economics and finance, but if you want to find this term in books, you won't be able to find it even if you tear through all the books on economics and finance. Of course, their "Agreement on Preventing Robbery" is also inexplicable. These three terms actually come from the same business. This business is very peculiar, and I think most of the readers don't know much about it, right? Well then, let me explain it to you here: this is a regional phenomenon, and its origin is Chaozhou, Guangdong.</p>
<p>Speaking of Chaozhou, you will remember that it is the place where the great Tang Dynasty writer Han Yu served as a prefect. Because when Prefect Han was here, he wrote a "Memorial to the Crocodile," which I think everyone who has received an old education has read, and our Chaozhou is therefore associated with it in people's minds. But today, times are different. Feudal literature, people know that it must be overthrown. The "Memorial to the Crocodile" is no longer valued, and our Chaozhou is also forgotten, right? There are occasional mentions of it: that is when poor friends in Shanghai, unable to make a living, send their clothes to pawnshops to get money, and are ridiculed by the shop assistants; or when down-and-out scholars, who desperately want to save face, take a small amount of money to Wusong Road to buy used suits, and are treated harshly by the shop assistants, and thus resentfully remember that this is all thanks to the people of our Chaozhou, and secretly curse them. Apart from this, our Chaozhou is rarely able to enter people's memories.</p>
<p>Yes, our Chaozhou should not be able to enter people's memories. Because there are no concessions opened to foreigners here; no smooth roads built by foreigners; no large cinemas, dance halls, and department stores opened by foreigners to provide people with happiness and enjoyment in the so-called "commercial areas." Nor are there beautiful natural or artificial landscapes for people to escape the summer heat or recuperate. In addition, the land is small and barren, and there are no special products that are valued by people, so it is also appropriate.</p>
<p>But this refers to the whole country. If we talk about Guangdong, it also occupies a considerable position economically.</p>
<p>I said above that the land here is small and barren, with absolutely no products. Why does it occupy an economic position? It turns out that a large portion of its residents go out to make a living. In addition to the pawnshops and used clothing businesses mentioned above, which are opened in Shanghai and other ports in China, there are also many who travel overseas to Southeast Asia to make a living. Although no one has come out to conduct a detailed survey, there is no doubt that they account for a very high percentage of the population here. Although they only run small businesses, or even mostly work as beasts of burden for others, the price they get is ultimately slightly higher than in China. They are all so hardworking and thrifty, and send most of their meager income back here. Because there are so many people, combined, it becomes a major, large income in Guangdong Province. According to a survey three years ago, this income is about 100 million yuan per year.</p>
<p>We don't have banks here. There is another organization that handles this kind of remittance business. This organization is similar to a money shop. We call it "Pi Ye" here; its institution is called "Pi Ju"; and the remitted money is called "Pi Yin."</p>
<p>But this "Pi Ju" is still not located in our Chaozhou, but in Shantou, because Shantou's transportation is more convenient than here, and it is also closer.</p>
<p>The business method of this "Pi Ju" is as follows:</p>
<p>Each "Pi Ju" must have branches or liaison offices in various parts of Southeast Asia. If overseas Chinese want to send money back home, they only need to hand the money and letters to the "Pi Ju" (if they are regular customers or have someone to guarantee, they can also owe money, but they have to pay very high interest and have a time limit for repayment). The "Pi Ju" will then issue a receipt and the remitter's letters and, depending on the amount of business at that time, send them back to the general "Pi Ju" in Shantou several times a month for large amounts, and once a month for smaller amounts. The general "Pi Ju" hires many "road horses" - that is, staff who specialize in delivering letters and silver. Once they receive the letters, they prepare enough cash and use these "road horses" to send it to the recipient's address, and read and explain their family letters to them, obtain the recipient's reply, and hand it over to the general "Pi Ju" to send back to the remitter's branch "Pi Ju" to give to the remitter.</p>
<p>This method is very old, but because its procedures are very clear and convenient for both the remitter and the recipient, it is still very popular and common today. However, in the past few months, it has also inevitably been blown by the hurricane of the world's economic downturn, and is gradually declining.</p>
<p>Originally, the reason why overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, and even the entire overseas area, have been able to create a considerable historical position is due to the European War. At that time, all countries were busy with war, and drove the youth of production to the battlefield, so they had no time to take care of the rear. Our compatriots took the opportunity to advance and ran overseas to do production work for them, and thus multiplied. By the time the European War ended, and coupled with the capitalist countries "deceiving each other," an "economic downturn" was brewing, creating unprecedented unemployment. They themselves have no way to solve the unemployment problem, so how can they tolerate our overseas Chinese to share their food? As a result, many vicious conspiracies were created, new rejections and old expulsions were made against our overseas Chinese. Our overseas Chinese are unorganized and unprotected, so of course they cannot resist, and their livelihoods are suddenly reduced. This is the general reason for the decline of "Pi Ye."</p>
<p>I have explained twice above that Chaozhou is small and barren, so even if it wants to produce, it lacks raw materials. Therefore, young and strong men cannot gain a foothold in their homeland. Their only way out is to go to Southeast Asia. Now Southeast Asia is "a dead end." This cuts off their livelihood. The world's robbers and petty thieves are all forced to "take risks" because of the pressure of life. Naturally, the final actions of these unemployed youths are self-evident.</p>
<p>As a result, the "road horses" of the "Pi Ju" are often robbed. Two or three years ago, our Chaozhou had the beautiful environment I described above, and it was truly a peaceful and prosperous age. Therefore, although the "road horses" were carrying piercing things, no one dared to violate the "king's law" and "patronize" them. They could carry out their duties freely without weapons. This has been passed down from generation to generation and has almost become a habit. Unexpectedly, the situation suddenly changed, and they could not cope. At the most</p>

<h3 id="e322">The Actual Tasks of Building Popular Language <a href="#e322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Yi</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>The issue of building a popular language has been discussed very enthusiastically, and several supplements' editors are sounding the retreat, as if they feel satisfied or tired of this discussion. In fact, as long as we pay attention to the opinions expressed by various people since the debate began, we will know that there is still no good conclusion so far. Everyone's opinions are still like blind people touching an elephant, thinking they have touched the whole thing when they have only touched a part. Moreover, no one has explained the basic understanding of this issue in detail. Therefore, even if I am as shallow as I am, I cannot help but join in the fun and offer some opinions.</p>
<p>II. Building a Popular Language is the Actual Demand of the Masses</p>
<p>"What is a popular language?" This is the question that most people first demand to be answered, and some people use this sentence as an excuse to oppose the popular language, just like when emerging literature was just emerging, celebrities and professors kept clamoring to "see the goods." Mr. Chen Zizhan, Chen Wangdao, and others believe that what can be heard, read, understood, and written is a popular language. Of course, there is nothing wrong with this, but it is not enough to explain the doubts of the general public. For example, someone asks: Isn't the popular vernacular written and understandable? Try to give an example of an article written in popular language - this will leave you speechless. At the current stage, our understanding of the popular language issue cannot be regarded as having a fixed form, but only as something that is developing due to the actual demands of the masses. In the face of the fierce attacks of imperialism and the panic of rural economic bankruptcy, the desperate war of the masses makes them urgently demand to create their own culture and even demand to build a linguistic form that expresses their lives. The popular language issue is not a simple linguistic issue, but is in line with the masses' anti-imperialist and anti-archaistic movements. Without the practice of the masses, the popular language cannot be established. "Take out the goods to see," if we start from such an understanding, we will know how ignorant and deceitful this sentence is. May I ask, when Mr. Sun Yat-sen first advocated the national revolution for the demands of the Chinese masses, could he take out any goods to see?</p>
<p>III. Is it Natural Development or Conscious Movement?</p>
<p>Some people regard the issue of building a popular language as a matter of natural language development. That's right, from vernacular language to popular language, it can be said that popular language is the upward development of vernacular language, just as capitalism develops from feudal society. Vernacular language itself contains elements of popular language. However, what cannot be forgotten here is that social evolution, in addition to the law of natural development, also has a kind of conscious movement. Society is progressing in contradiction at all times. When this contradiction expands to the point where it hinders its own progress, then a force is needed to push it forward. This push has the meaning of "anti." The current proposal to build a popular language is undoubtedly a conscious movement, undoubtedly because the vernacular language has been stolen by bureaucrats and compradors, and has lost its progressiveness. To advance it to the stage of popular language requires force, which requires not only a struggle against the classical language that attempts to revive, but also against the vernacular language that has lost its progressiveness. Peaceful development is enough to make the vernacular language surrender more and more to the classical language and foreign stereotyped writing. It is even more impossible to improve and correct it.</p>
<p>IV. Where to Start</p>
<p>Without the entire cultural movement and the practice of the masses, the popular language issue cannot be resolved. Then, how do we start building? This seems to have become a difficult hurdle. Mr. Hu Yuzhi advocates creating phonetic writing first, and Mr. Tao Xingzhi advocates educating the masses first. Mr. Hu's opinion can only be regarded as an ultimate goal of this movement. Putting it forward now does have the danger of canceling this movement, because a change in writing is by no means something that can be accomplished in a short time. It can never be said that we cannot talk about the popular language issue because there is no phonetic writing. If Mr. Tao regards education as education in the form of schools, it is not a good way. Mr. Tao's own educational experience has probably gained a lot of lessons. I think:</p>
<p>(1) As mentioned above, popular language is the actual</p>
<p>The present of building a popular language must first enrich the content of the masses' cultural struggle and strengthen the masses' anti-imperialist and anti-archaistic movement. Only with rich life content can a sound form of expressing this content be produced.</p>
<p>(2) Promoting the unification of language and writing from the development of local language and dialect literature will lead to the future of phonetic writing. Only in this way can this movement be combined with the actual lives of the masses in various places.</p>

<p>When they first discovered that bandits would rob, they also carried pistols with them, but when they encountered bandits, they lost the method and courage to use the pistols. As a result, they would inevitably have both the silver and the pistols robbed. And the bandits, having robbed the pistols, would be even more "like a tiger with wings." This is also a clear reason for the decline of "Pi Ye."</p>
<p>"Pi Ye" has been greatly hit, so they are looking for remedies. The first reason is something they don't quite understand, and it is not something that their partial strength can solve. They have no choice but to try to salvage it from the second reason. Not long ago, they convened a guild and resolved this "Anti-Robbery Agreement."</p>
<p>The full text of this agreement is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If "Pi Yin" is robbed on the road, the nearby villages must immediately come to the rescue. If they can capture the actual robber on the spot, and send him to the official for interrogation and conviction together with this guild, a reward of 200 silver dollars will be given by the guild for each actual robber captured.</p>
<p>(2) If "Pi Yin" is robbed on the road, the nearby villages must immediately come to the rescue. If they can capture the actual robber on the spot and recover the robbed "Pi Yin," in addition to implementing Article 1, the loser will withdraw 200 yuan from every 1,000 yuan of the recovered "Pi Yin" as a reward.</p>
<p>(3) If the villagers are injured by the robbers while coming to the rescue, those who are seriously injured will be given 5,000 yuan for medical expenses; those who are slightly injured will be rewarded appropriately; those who become disabled due to serious injuries will be given an additional reward of 200 silver dollars for post-care expenses.</p>
<p>(4) If the villagers are seriously injured and die while coming to the rescue, 500 silver dollars will be given as a consolation payment.</p>
<p>(5) The guild is not responsible for redeeming "road horses" who are kidnapped. If they are injured or killed as a result of being kidnapped, the guild will give an appropriate consolation payment.</p>
<p>(6) The rewards and consolations are the same whether on a ship or on land.</p>
<p>(7) If the nearby villages sit idly by and do not come to the rescue when a "road horse" is in danger, in addition to being reported to the official for investigation, the overseas "Pi Ju" will be notified to stop "Pi Yin" in that area.</p>
<p>This agreement is only a passive measure of "treating the head when it hurts" and "treating the feet when they hurt." In my opinion, the effectiveness of this passive measure is equal to zero, because the "actual robbers" are the "villages" who are expected to come to the rescue!</p>
<p>From this point, we can see the entire state of Chaozhou Society!</p>

<h3 id="e325">The Story of the Invention of the Airship (6) <a href="#e325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>— Shulin</p>
<p>The first six airships built by Zeppelin were all ruined and failed. The seventh one was 500 feet long, but it was still smashed to pieces by a storm.</p>
<p>Due to the frequent occurrence of accidents, various countries temporarily became indifferent to the matter of manufacturing airships. Especially after the start of World War I, various countries focused on the manufacture of airplanes, and paid even less attention to large airships.</p>
<p>Germany alone, in the midst of the neglect of various countries, achieved the large Zeppelin-style airship. It was more than 500 feet long and the whole body was divided into several small parts, each of which was equipped with a light gas bag. Even if one of them was destroyed by gun-cannon fire, the airship would not fall. The Zeppelin airship was rigid, and the entire skeleton was made of aluminum alloy, covered with linen cloth, and the internal balloon was made of cow intestine skin.</p>
<p>During the European War, Germany, surrounded by enemy forces on all sides, did not act with trepidation, but filled this monster with bombs, passed through the Allied army positions at night, crossed the Dover Strait, and leisurely attacked London, the capital of England, from afar. Not only did the people of London suffer from the harm of bombs, but also their hearts were greatly threatened.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about Count Zeppelin. Zeppelin's life is a good model for displaying the German spirit.</p>
<p>IV. About Count Zeppelin</p>
<p>Ferdinand von Zeppelin, the inventor of the Zeppelin-style airship, was born on July 8, 1838, in the Count's family on the shore of Lake Constance. The count, with the temperament of a North German, was rich in will from an early age, lively and fond of traveling. It is said that he had a special interest in natural science from an early age.</p>
<p>After Zeppelin grew up, he entered the military academy and went to the United States as a German general. At that time, the American Civil War was just beginning. Once, Zeppelin and two or three colleagues went to visit the Niagara Falls. Zeppelin said:</p>
<p>"There is nothing interesting about looking at this waterfall on land. It is better to watch it while swimming." As he spoke, he jumped into the rapids regardless of his friends' dissuasion and swam to appreciate it. Although this matter is inevitably reckless, Zeppelin's spirit cannot but be admired here.</p>
<p>Soon after, he returned to Germany, and the Franco-Prussian War began. 850,000 German troops, due to the skillful operations of the famous general Mouge, invaded France, captured Napoleon III in Sedan, and besieged Paris, the capital. The citizens of Paris stubbornly resisted for four months, and finally opened the city and surrendered due to exhaustion.</p>
<p>This is the story of the siege of Paris.</p>
<p>Count Zeppelin also served in the army as a general. One day, he saw a balloon flying high in the sky in Paris. The balloon soared upwards and flew over the German army positions due to the wind, flowing towards the distant countryside. The soldiers below were solemnly guarding their positions, not knowing what to do, fearing that the balloon would communicate with the French army outside the city and transmit secret orders.</p>
<p>Zeppelin was greatly impressed by this balloon.</p>
<p>After this, Zeppelin buried himself in the research of airships. This fact was the motive.</p>
<p>Zeppelin was appointed Colonel for his merits in this war, then promoted to Major General, and then elected as a military adviser to participate in and interfere with political affairs. At the age of fifty-three, he retired and returned to the countryside.</p>
<p>After achieving success and fame, Mr. Qi did not, like ordinary people, enjoy his remaining years with romance and entertainment. At the old age of fifty-three, he attempted to invent an airship. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e326">The Use of "Popular Language" in Film (Part 2) <a href="#e326" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c326" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">326</a></h3>
<p>— Danfeng</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a nation should preserve the existence of its different language forms; this cannot be equated with preserving each nation's inherent language and culture. The reason is simple: for the healthy development of a free and independent nation, its language should be completely unified to form a unified culture. If we want to maintain every different dialect or local vernacular, it would be tantamount to splitting national unity. Therefore, in film, we can produce purely Mongolian or Tibetan films, even Miao films, but we should never have Cantonese or Fujian films within the Han ethnicity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should strive to eliminate local dialects and vernaculars. In fact, when domestic transportation fully connects the cultures of various regions, local vernaculars will not exist forever, although it is still impossible to melt the national language into one. Therefore, we acknowledge that film is a tool of education, and unifying the languages of various regions through the language and text of film, helping to eliminate the existence of dialects and vernaculars, is a necessary task at present. Why should we advocate the use of dialects and vernaculars in film? Currently, we strongly oppose the production of sound films with Cantonese dialogue.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, we may as well give another example. We are, of course, absolutely opposed to classical Chinese subtitles in the style of "If Heaven does not rain, what shall we do?". On the other hand, we are equally opposed to such profound colloquial language as, "What shall we do? If the heavens are forever so stingy and unwilling to send down a drop of sweet rain." Furthermore, if we use our local dialect at home, it would be something like, "If this sky never rains, what are we all going to do?". Can this kind of popular language be understood by the general public? If it were translated into Cantonese or Fujianese, it would be even more incomprehensible. Therefore, the popular language suitable for film is, "It hasn't rained for days, what should we do?", a very clear and concise sentence.</p>
<p>I remember not long ago, someone in the local supplement of the Shen Bao used a whole section of Pudong or Ningbo dialect, "×倷×倷," as an example of popular language, which was clearly a malicious distortion. Popular language is not about promoting popular dialects and vernaculars, but about liberating language and writing from written vernacular and making it something that is easily understood by the public. Of course, there are many difficulties in this process, especially in practice. If we intellectuals are unwilling to delve into the masses and do not discover and create from actual life, we will not succeed.</p>
<p>As for the creation of films, in the current stage, we cannot yet unify the languages of various regions. In order to maintain local color, we may as well pay attention to the differences in pronunciation, just like the German music professor in "Little Women," who can have a German accent, and John Barrymore in "The Mad Genius," who can also have a slight Russian "R" accent. And for Jiangnan subjects, we can emphasize their local color in pronunciation, and the same is true for Shandong or Guangdong. This is not just a matter of acting skills; everyone engaged in the film culture movement should pay attention to this. (End)</p>

<p>— Danfeng</p>
<p>Affairs of a Gentleman—Cathay—</p>
<p>Like most vulgar American films, this one does not lack love entanglements between men and women; what is different is that it also adds some of the elements unique to detective films.</p>
<p>The general story is like this: A writer has had romantic relationships with many women, and later, because of these entangled love affairs, he even tells his servant that he will commit suicide. So the servant says that even if he commits suicide, he must write a suicide note to the "Police" in his own handwriting to avoid implicating others. He does as his servant says, but in the end, he dies at the hands of his servant. The play begins with the death of the writer. The police find the suicide note and then, from a publisher's mouth, learn that the deceased had hosted many old lovers the night before. Thus, the story narrates the dinner party at the time and his difficulty in coping with the many women, resulting in an attempt to commit suicide after being repeatedly stimulated. Finally, the servant, seeing that he is not committing suicide but the suicide note is written, takes advantage of this opportunity, fueled by the old resentment that the master has committed adultery with his wife, and shoots the writer.</p>
<p>This work adopts the form of a detective film, but the main purpose is to write about the writer's entanglements with women. The playwright has achieved little else besides structuring the relationships between each character quite tightly. And to say that he is attacking writers for treating love as a trifle is simply echoing what others have said, feeling bored in meaningless entanglements. Comparatively, he used the same techniques as in plays, unfolding the characters tightly and explaining their conflicting contradictions. Therefore, those dialogues, if regarded as a play, are quite interesting. In the end, he tells us that the bougeoisie writer's life is so licentious, and the price is being shot by a lover's husband. However, the playwright has not fully depicted this aspect, if exposing them was the main point.</p>
<p>The director achieved the degree that the playwright wanted to describe, but the constant sitting and dialogue made the play exceptionally dull in the middle. This kind of play is not considered brilliant even in "business acumen."</p>
<p>From the story to the performance, from the set to the photography, there is nothing particularly commendable. Even every actor is, on the whole, very mediocre.</p>

<h3 id="e328">After Watching "Sacrifice for Whom?" <a href="#e328" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c328" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">328</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Chen</p>
<p>Evaluating the films of small companies is a more difficult task; this "Sacrifice for Whom?" produced by Jixing Company is no exception. To say that it is disappointing, there are some merits; to say that it is satisfying, it seems to have some shortcomings. However, when changing to a less demanding attitude, this "Sacrifice for Whom?" is probably not very far from the standard level.</p>
<p>The story is an old one: it tells of a female spy who seduces people with her beauty. Originally, this kind of story is very common, and with some emphasis, it may not be successful. However, in the entire unfolding of the story of "Sacrifice for Whom?", it is very bland and fixed. Apart from the two military officers and a female spy fighting for love, there are no new interludes or powerful twists. This cannot but be attributed to the director's lack of ability.</p>
<p>One scene in "Lifespan without Brain"—Nanjing screening</p>
<p>On the performance side, the first shortcoming is the lack of detailed consideration of the various equipment of the Volunteer Army. The Volunteer Army should be hidden in the "green gauze tent." However, the film is like a full-fledged army: elaborate captain's residence, female secretary, solid prison, soldiers drinking in the store in military uniforms, beautiful commander and office... In addition, such as the two soldiers' duel is too long, Jin Wenqi (another soldier's lover) goes out and encounters rain to express the pain of being lovelorn is too inconsistent. In this level of performance, we really don't see any skill. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e329">Written After Watching "Sacrifice for Whom?" <a href="#e329" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c329" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">329</a></h3>
<p>— Naihuang</p>
<p>Jixing Company's "Sacrifice for Whom?" is a film based on the theme of the Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>It is writing about a story in the Northeast Volunteer Army, where two military officers are fighting for a female spy. There are quite a few inappropriate things in it, so let me point out two of them.</p>
<p>(1) How can the Volunteer Army casually chat with women under the shade of a tree? (2) Indeed, this is the most wrong point. How can there be modern furniture, and there are also women's photos and vases with flowers inserted in them, so that they can live a comfortable life there? This is fundamentally impossible.</p>
<p>Although these two points are small flaws, they are enough to make the entire film end in failure.</p>
<p>As for the director's technique, it is too lax, making people feel tired.</p>
<p>As for the story itself, it is simply inexplicable, making people feel too forced.</p>
<p>As for the actors, Huang Manli's performance is not in line with her identity. As for Zhang Yuting, Wu Wenchao, etc., they are still working hard.</p>
<p>The set is too simple. The photography is also mediocre.</p>

<p>— Wen Yin</p>
<p>The train started. Jifu curled up in the corner of the compartment, watching Chicago unfold outside the window scene by scene. Scattered under his feet were things like wide-brimmed glasses and fake beards. He sighed deeply and said to his two companions, "I never thought I would fall to this point and become an actor myself. This is really a shameful thing." O'Malley remembered the root of their failure, so he grinned and said, "It's a pity you didn't play "Joan of Arc" yourself." Jifu said, "Among the sixty-eight plays I've done, the most artistic one is "Joan of Arc." Alas, what a great failure! O'Malley, if I am a genius, I owe it to my failure. You must remember this clearly." Webb interjected solemnly, "Jifu, listen. We will arrive in New York at 9:45 tomorrow morning, and the bank opens at 10 o'clock. Three banks have your IOUs, totaling 221,000 yuan. The first thing they will do tomorrow morning is to run to your Jifu Theater and seal its doors... Then your fake beard will be useless!" After he finished speaking, he looked at Jifu sadly. Jifu jumped up and said, "They dare?" But he slumped back down, feeling a little scared in his heart. Webb then stuttered and said again, "Jifu, listen. There is still one way. If you can find a way to get Lilian Garland to sign a contract, then you don't have to be afraid of anything. Lilian Garland is also on this train now." Jifu couldn't help pressing his hand to his chest and said miserably, "Lilian... is she on the train?" O'Malley said, "Don't pretend. Her compartment is next door." Jifu smiled and said, "I think maybe she did it on purpose." O'Malley said, "I also think she did it on purpose." Jifu sat up straight and said, "Since she came here, she has already made the first move. It's my turn to make the second move. I would rather meet her halfway." O'Malley said, "Great. As long as you can get her to sign the contract, then all our worries can be turned into nothing. But I can't help but think that it's probably not an easy task." Jifu said very easily, "In fact, there is no break between us." O'Malley, you can send a telegram to the flower shop in Toledo and ask them to send all the good flowers to..." O'Malley continued, "Compartment B." Jifu continued, "Okay, Compartment B of this train... And that note... Let me see... O'Malley, get a pencil. I think this is how it should be written..." He paused for a moment, then recited with emotion, "From the tomb of someone you loved yesterday!" He lay back down, closed his eyes, and savored the taste of those words. Then he sighed and said, "These words are really perfect, nothing could be more appropriate. Why don't I read a few books when I have this kind of talent?" O'Malley silently wrote down the note. He never dared to say anything when Jifu was happy. Jifu said to him again, "O'Malley, I want you to go and meet her first, like a chance encounter. You can casually mention that I have already written a script for her. Ah, going up to meet her like this can be said to be a sure thing. You can open that briefcase, which is full of scripts. They are all wonderful works." O'Malley glanced at him, then pretended to be helpless and said, "Are you going to do that again?" Jifu quickly comforted him, "Don't worry. You just need to tell her that I have found a good script for her. She can play a person who is half devil and half woman, who made a great sacrifice for love. Okay. Okay. Go!" He stood up and pushed him towards the door. (To be continued)</p>
