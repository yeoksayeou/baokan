<h3 id="c20">美國之最優勢海軍案　愼· <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>美國參議院於三月七日以六十五票對十八票之多數。通過一月卅日經衆院核准之最優勢海軍建艦案。該案由衆院海軍委員會長文生氏提出。其造艦程序爲八時砲巡洋艦一艘。六時砲巡洋艦五艘。一萬五千二百噸航空母艦一艘。驅逐艦六十五艘。潛水艇三十艘。建造經費爲五億六千五百萬美金至十億美金。同時更擬添造飛機一千一百八二四架。經費爲九千五百萬美金。此案目的在使美國之海軍力符合一九二二年華盛頓海軍條約所規定之限度以偌大經費消耗於海空軍之建設。且適值經濟恐慌尙未克服國際關係正在惡化時。其影響及於各方者。自異常重大可不待言。</p>
<p>自世界大戰至一九二八及一九二九年間。美國經濟之發逹。確爲空前未有匪特由債務國一躍而爲債權國。且取得世界之第一位。不但重工業金融投資及化學工業皆有長足之發展。卽兼有輕工業意味之人造絲業亦頗稱進步。美國産業勢力之伸張。旣如是其遠大。自必思有以保障之道。其道唯何。曰消極方面。第一須不畏敵國之封鎖。太平洋交通孔道之維持。尤爲當務之急。第二須能掩護其戰時軍需品之輸送。與必需品之取得。第三須足以確保其屬地菲列濱·關島·夏威夷·與阿拉斯加之安全。積極方面則第一須仗不流血的經濟鬥爭。爲武力鬥爭之凖備。藉此以顯示美國之實力。使其假想敵之日本。不敢貿然啓釁。第二則須充實其軍事力量。以爲最後制服假想敵之武</p>
<p>器。</p>
<p>夫日本固以海上王國自詡者也。其實力殊不可輕侮。美人寧不知之甚稔。此次通過之最優勢建艦案。不僅足爲國内實業界謀局部之補救。且足引起日本之追蹝角逐。使其因軍備過度擴張而日卽於經濟自殺之途。</p>
<p>不寗惟是吾人試觀現時之美國海軍實力。殊不能怪其國領袖之惴惴不安。說者謂美國卽令將大西洋艦隊全部移置於其太平洋之前衛根據地｜｜珍珠港。充其極亦僅能勉力護持本國沿太平洋一帶之安全。欲圖巴拿馬運河之絶對保持。卽不能無疑。蓋美國之輕巡洋艦固不及日本之新銳。驅逐艦之陳舊者尤多。潛水艇實力薄弱。亦不足以制勝照此情况。無論在太平洋上箝制日本海軍之活動爲不可能。卽欲制限日本海軍。勿令控制遠東海權。亦不免等於幻想。一旦戰事發生。美國在遠東之海軍根據地菲利濱·軍事要點關島等。均將爲日軍所蹂躪。而堪作美國空軍前衛之亞留仙羣島。亦不免受其襲擊。甚至陷落於敵人之手。軍事之形勢如是。則某遠東市塲又幾何而不爲人所侵奪耶。</p>
<p>美國旣審知太平洋形勢之嚴重。自身處境之危殆。故不得不乘時奮發先行鞏固其海軍之地位。一待海軍實力自恃而無恐。便可再進而發揮航空隊之優勢以操最後之勝算。若然則美國在遠東市塲庶幾有永久維持之可能。重要原料可以輸入而無阻。卽平時帶有軍事臭味之經濟鬥爭。亦不致爲人所乘也。</p>

<p>（巴黎）法國對於英國軍縮問題備忘錄之復文、日昨已由最高國防委員會加以研究、外傳此項覆文不日卽可送出、但據本社探悉、法國有關係各當局認爲此一問題具有生存利害關係、非俟澈底明瞭後未便作答、以故覆文須在數日以外始能送出云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>新生活之中心凖則</p>
<p>行營紀念週之訓詞</p>
<p>南昌通訊、日前（五日）行營舉行擴大紀念週、蔣委員長出席訓話、題爲「新生活運動、應注意禮樂與時間、」原詞業經整理、茲誌如下、</p>
<p>近來南昌整個的社會、天天有進步、前方剿匪的將士、也天天有進步、這是新生活運動發生以來的好現象、今天我想將新生活運動所最要注重　的幾件事、和大家講一講、前次我講新生活運動之要義、已經講過、新生活運動、就是要使我們全部生活、都合乎禮義廉恥、因爲無論是一個國家、一個社會、一個機關、一個家庭、以至毎一個人、要向上發展、要成功任何大小事業、都必須依據禮義廉恥的精神、所以不僅是整個民族的生活、國家的大事、要依據禮義廉恥、就是個人的私生活、也不可離開禮義廉恥、這是我們新生活運動的中心凖則、現在我們再問這禮義廉恥中那一件事最要緊呢、我們看這四個字排列的次序、就可以知道、</p>
<p>第一要緊的就是「禮」、再看我們中國從前敎人的科目所謂禮·樂·射·御書·數·六藝、也是以「禮」爲最先、「禮」旣是四維和六藝的首要、所以我們要造成一個文明進步安固發展的國家、社會家庭或是一個機關、就先要有「禮」、無論軍隊·學生·子弟·或國民、如不注重禮、便一切都没有用、我們負有敎導責任的人、如果知道這個道（</p>
<p>理、便没有一個人不能敎好、受敎的人、如果知道這個道理、也就無論什麽學問、都可以學好、無論什麽事情、都可以完成、現在一般的丢病、就是不知「禮」的重要、所以無論是學校軍隊和社會、統統不能成一個東西、像這様下去、如何能夠成大功、立大業、完成革命、實現總理的主義呢、</p>
<p>大家要曉得、人和禽獸有什麽根本的區别呢、很多的禽獸也會講話、有種種特殊的技能與知覺靈敏、至於飲食居住、更不必講、都和人類没有什麽根本區别、然則人和禽獸根本的區别在那裏呢、就是在乎知禮與不知禮、人之所以爲人、旣是因爲知禮、那麽、如果做一個人而知禮·不重禮·不行禮·那便不能呌人、和禽獸一様、所以父母旣生下我們來做一個人、就要學禮·知禮·行禮才可以無忝所生、不愧做一個人、大家應當曉得、總理平生所著的第一本書、就是民權初步、講社圑的組織、會議的法式、都是圑體活動或公共生活的基本軌則、總理講三民主義、講了幾十年、何以他不先著一本三民主義、而要最先著民權初步呢、就是看了中國人一點不懂圑體生活的秩序、不懂禮節、所以要先著這一本民權初步、拿社會上一切禮的基本、來敎導一般國民、民權初步包含一切「禮」的精神、實在是最完善切用之「禮」的實習、如果人家連民權初步都不知道、那末、一切圑的活動、便全無禮法、什麽社會圑體的組織、都不能成功、國家格外不必講、所以我們要想實現主義、完成革命、建立自由平等的國家、一定要先有社會建設的基礎、卽是要熟悉并做到民權初步、能夠重禮·學禮·行禮·如果中國人個個能知道民權初步、而且能領會民權初步的精神、而施之於一般事物、我相信革命早已完成、國家早已建設好了、</p>
<p>土耳其·意大利·和德國、他們何以能夠很快的完成革命新建設的國家、而我們的革命到今天、反要失敗呢、最根本的原因、就是由於一股國民、没有一個不遵重社會的秩序、嚴守圑體的紀律</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>、推而至於忠於國家和民族克盡國民的責任、事事物物、都能合乎禮義廉恥、因此不僅他們國内的敵人自然屈服、而且一切外國人見了這種情形、也不得不肅然起敬、我們現在所提倡的新生活運動、就是一種建設國家復興民族之基本之革命運動、凡是參加這個運動的同志、尤其是黨政軍學警各界領袖、應當曉得「禮」是新生活運動的最中心、最急要的事情、無論是開會的時候、講話的時候、總要隨時隨地敎他們重禮·知禮·行禮·比方說開會的時候、行三鞠躬禮、應當知何行、無論何時何地聽國歌、或是見到國族升降、要表示敬意、這些是一般國民所必須懂得的禮、我們要格外注意敎會一般國民、</p>
<p>還有一點、大家應知道的、就是所謂「禮」、一定要有節、没有節、便不成禮、節是什麽、就是最合理的規矩程度、如果没有規矩節度、那便是亂、不能呌「禮」、所以禮與節、是不可分的、「節」的意義在禮、禮的表現在節、若是有禮無節、卽等於無禮、比方現在軍隊裏一部下對上官行禮、他不待受禮的人答完禮、就先將自已的手放下來、這就是無節、不成禮、不　呌部下向上官敬禮、只好算上官對部下敬禮、這様還有禮嗎、要曉得敬禮的人、須等到受禮的人眼睛看到你、答完禮以後、才恭恭敬敬將自的手放下、這些事情、大家是不是敎過自已的部下或學生、不僅没有敎過、而且我講過幾次、大家還是不會、因此、可見知禮之難、不要說社會上一般民衆不能明禮、就是行營這個首腦機關、也還有没有做好的地方、卽如今天贊禮的人、就不對、他只知禮而不知節、大家一鞠躬還没有起來的時候、他就呌二鞠躬、二鞠躬還没有行完、又呌三鞠躬、這様没有節、便不成禮了、</p>
<p>還有普通各部隊裏喊口令、也是一様、往往有第一個口令、比方一立正喊出之後、他不看受令人是不是已經統統立正好了、隨卽就發第二個口令、向左看或向右看、這也是無節、不知道我們一個口令發出去以後、一定要兩個眼睛看到所有受命令的人、一定要等他們個個人都照第一個口令做好之後、才能再發第二個口令、這様、才能動作實在、從容中節、也才算有禮、像這様去敎部下或學生、才能收效、外國的敎育、就是如此、一切都脚踏實地、循規蹈矩、一步一步來、</p>
<p>一件一件做好、中國的軍隊、所以練不好、没有精神、就是因爲敎的人只喊口令、不注意受令的人、卽口到而目不到、外國的軍隊、所以練得好有精神、也就是因爲他們一切的敎練實在、一個口令喊出去、不管部下幾千幾百人、一定要看到</p>
<p>個個人都已做好、才發第二個口令、這叚話是講禮一定要有節、我們行禮、一定要中節、</p>
<p>正因爲禮一定要有節、所以禮和樂有不可分的關係、樂是什麽、樂就是節、唯其節調和諧、乃成其音樂高美、而樂之節奏、典禮之節度、就其意義而作用而言、實在是一個東西、所以我們要知禮、一定要知樂、現在我們的樂怎様、例如我們中國船、經過外國所停泊的地方、他們奏我們的國樂、是多麽莊嚴雄壯、而爲我們本國一般軍樂所不及、就拿行營的軍樂、來和南京方面國民政府或是軍官學校的軍樂比較、奏黨歌同是一個調子、用的也是銅鼓銅號、但是吹起來的聲音、就差得多了、這是什麽道理、就是我們吹的人只顧吹會就算事、不再去研究如何可以吹得更能合拍莊嚴雄壯、以後一定要注意研究改進才好、</p>
<p>這是講奏樂的人</p>
<p>再講唱歌的人、本來我們會唱歌的時候、一方</p>
<p>面要看着音樂隊做手勢、一方面要看音樂、隨着手勢和樂聲來唱、然後才能全塲一致、節奏凖確、但是一般中國人唱歌的時候、奏樂的只顧在那邊吹、唱的人各自在這邊唱、結果唱得整齊不整齊、音調節奏對不對都不管、這如何可稱音樂、這不過是舉兩件極粗極淺的事情、來說明中國人對於音樂不重視、因而不能由知樂而知禮、由重禮而重樂、</p>
<p>今後我們做新活運動的人、一定要想種種方法、隨時隨地來敎導一般國民、使他同時注重禮樂、我們所做的新生活運動、就其方式與内容來看、完全就是一種社會敎育、目的就是要使社會人人都能明禮·義·廉·恥、負責任、守紀律、能夠人人學會·禮·樂·射·御·書·數·六種學術和技能、尤其是「禮」與「樂」兩種首要的東西、這四維與六藝、乃是做人所必具的德性與智能、要做一個完全的高尙國民、一定要件件具備、</p>
<p>現在一般中國人、以爲自已一切都很好、外國人是故意來欺壓我們、我以爲這種觀念、在許多方面是不對的、要知道物必先腐、而後蟲生之、人必自侮、而後人侮之、國必自伐、而後人伐之、不知道有許多事情、都由於我們中國人自已太不爭氣、一般國民的德性和智能、要遜人一籌、在做人尤其是做現代的國民、各種條件上、不如人家完備、卽不能和人家平等、現在我們要提倡新生活、就是要使一般國民知道這個道理、憬然自覺、奮發有爲、依據禮義廉恥爲最高準則、從自已日常的生活衣食住行起頭、努力改進自已的全生活、增進自已的生活的德性和智能、不僅要能具備與現代各國國民完全平等的人格、而且要能發揚我們民族固有的美德、要能駕現代任何國家的國民而上之、如此、才不愧爲中華民國的國民、爲父母之肖子、才不愧爲三民主義的信徒、</p>
<p>最後還有一點、是我們提倡新生活運動所應當特别注重而以身作則來敎導社會上一般人的、就是寳貴時間、第一條要緊的事情、就是要遵守時間、本來宇宙與人生的一切、都依有演進與時間與空間的縱橫配合之中、然就空間的常有與壽命之短促而言、如駒過隙、難得而易失的時間、的確是吾人一切事業與生命之母、比方就戰爭而言、我常常說過、打仗就是爭時間、誰能寳貴時間、一切比敵人迅速、誰就可以獲得最後勝利、其成敗生死的關鍵、完全就在時間、由人類的生活推而至於一切生命現象、都是收「奮鬭爭存」爲基調、都包含於廣乏的戰爭之中、以時間决其生死成敗、由這一點、更可洞見時間之可貴、</p>
<p>現在一般中國人、就是因爲不知道這一層最要緊的道理、所以不知道寳貴時間、凡事不能遵守時間、結果各人浪費其寳貴生命、整個社會國家（</p>
<p>和民族、也就不會有進步、不會能夠很好建設起來、因此、我們民族要被人家目爲野蠻落伍、肆意侵略、現在我們提倡新生活運動、一定要使一般國民能明白時間之可貴、人人能及時努力、能遵守時間、自個人的起居作息、以至多數人的社社圑體的活動、一定都要嚴格的遵守時間、做一定工作、如此則時間不致浪費、事可以辦好、比方講我們一個地方、定好幾點幾分要到、我們要一定幾點幾分就到、這些良好習慣、完全要靠我們提倡新生活運動的人、尤其是黨政軍警各界領袖、要能以身作則、說到就做到、再監督自已的部下或學生做到、再敎導一般社會民衆做到、我聽說行營裏面有極少數的主管長官、不能嚴格監督自已的屬員、毎天辦公、聽他們隨便簽簽到、或是到之後就走了、如果是這様那麽可以成功、一個軍事機關、更如何可以呌做一個最高的首腦機關、所以很希望行營各位同志、能注意這點、本着「進思盡忠退思補過」的意思、對剛才所講的這點、「有則改之無則加勉」、總要我們自已先做到遵守時間、才能聲動全南昌全江西、以至全中國、所以現在我們大家要以此互勉、那一個能寳貴時間、遵守時間的、就是革命的同志、可以成大功立大業、那一個不能寳貴時間、與遵守時間、就是自暴自棄、無論他的本領怎麽好、任何大小事業、都不會成功、時間乃一切事業與生命之母、我們要成功一切事業實現生命最高的</p>
<p>意義與價値、首先要寳貴時間、寳貴時間、要從遵守時間做起、</p>
<p>今天是講我們提倡新生活、當特别注重禮樂與時間、這個道理、是人人所應當明瞭、畢生所應身體力行、而亦終身受用不盡的、希望大家時到之後就做、否則便是甘做劣等的人、走失敗的路、能夠做便不愧爲現代文明國家的國民、一切可以成功、」（三月九日）</p>

<p>主席報告　主席童行白報告、略謂、</p>
<p>今日上海市全體童子軍</p>
<p>舉行贈塔典禮、此事實打破過去一切活動之紀錄、　吳市長自就任以來、對於童軍事之倡導、實爲歷來所未見、而使本市童軍事業得長足之進展、給予全市童軍以激勵、故收全市童子軍自動捐資、購備紀念塔、聊表感戴之忱</p>
<p>、古諺云、聚沙成塔、此舉實深符此意、吳市長曾爲本人言、擬與全市童子軍作野外之活動、足見吳市長對於童軍事業之關懷、且願與共同生活、此實爲我人所感戴不已者、我人旣欲恢復國家之光榮、則當先圖民族之復興、復興民族、則尤應革除民族之惡劣風氣、今蔣委員長倡導之新生活運動、卽本此義、童軍之一切規律、亦所以一洗中國舊有烅劣根性、造成新生活、本人之意、以爲童軍生活、不獨應普遍於全體學生界、抑且應普及於全民族也、以吳市長愛護童軍之精神、我人應相互鼓勵、造成童軍事業前途之光明、</p>
<p>市長演說　略謂、今天上海市童軍界、舉行此隆重之典禮、本人認爲畢生最榮幸之事、同時亦不免有所恐懼、榮幸者何、主席謂、此乃十餘年來童軍界之創舉、此舉又非出於理事會或各圑圑長之意、純依全市童子軍所主動、是以本人深覺此事爲畢生最榮幸者、恐懼者何、雖余爲一革命黨人、應以復興中華民族爲已任、且應如何努力、以完成此使命、而復興民族之起點及基本、卽童軍事業、則革命黨對於童軍事業、實義不容辭、努力做去、但毎以時間及政務之關係、未能盡全力於此、而今反蒙以如是隆重之紀念品見贈、焉得不抱慚於心、所以過去實覺慚愧、將來尤覺恐懼、是以本人將此紀念物、作爲座、</p>
<p>右銘、俾隨時予余以提醒和剌激、努力於革命之使命、對此復興民族之起點、及基本工作、如童軍事業、應更自策勵、努力做去、要人尙有數言、供獻諸君、且願諸君能將此數言、轉告於親友者、蓋今日全國人士、莫不以圖存爲當務之急、圖存云云、卽如蔣委員長於南昌所倡導之新生活運動是也、蓋所謂圖存、莫非將中國造成新時代之國家、方有力量以圖存、方可與其他各國競爭生存也、造成新時代之銅塔縮影　（龔叔賢攝）</p>
<p>國家、尤當注意於全民族生活之近代化、今者、中國人民有兩種極端矛盾之生活、一則於都市中所易見者、其生活極端放浪享樂、一則在内地所易見者、其生活悲苦異常、此均爲違背新時代生活之原義、我人之所謂新時代生活、蓋其生活應有刻苦耐勞堅毅果敢之精神、一方面欲减少人民生活上之痛苦目的、又不能使其陷於窮奢極侈、步歐美工業發逹國家人民之後塵也、我人旣以復興民族爲使命、則對於此項使命、應努力完成之、而於此復興民族之起點、及基本工作、如童軍事業、則更應加以注意、本人受此隆儀、除表示感謝外、并將此紀念品、作爲座右銘、予余以剌激及提醒而不忘復興民族過程中之重要工作也、</p>
<p>加入童軍　當典禮將畢時、吳市長正式當衆宣佈加入童子軍、童行白·潘公展二氏、亦同時加入、全塲童子軍代表鼓掌歡呼和之、</p>

<p>以上與汪，陳，郭，金數君先作了一回學習文學的計劃的檢查，並略示了我們對於他們的批評、以下提出我們一點較具體的意見、向一般讀者請敎。編者</p>
<p>在原則上我們的研讀文學的計劃，無論取任何步驟，在總的方面說來，應該是初步的，入門的，一般的，概念的。我們現在不能把範圍擬得太廣太高、在運用上方不致於摸不着邊際。我們不是說絶對不應有太廣太高的範圍；不過，那是進一步的事，待到「初步的、入門的，一般的。概念的，」已有了「相常根底」後、諸君在研究上自可以左右逢源、那時、諸君的計劃任憑怎麽高廣、自已也可以有方法去謀妥善的處置了。我們截長補短，參以我們的一點意見，爲諸君貢獻一個初步的研究計劃。</p>
<p>第一期｜以先讀幾部文學概論，幾十本創作，并以社會科學的基本知識的探討爲主體。</p>
<p>第二期｜以文學理論的研究爲主體。</p>
<p>第三期｜除以上二項研究繼續深化外并探討創作方法。</p>
<p>第一期可讀之書，社會科學基本知識部分可參看二月廿一廿二廿三本欄「社會科學的初步讀法」一文中所列書目。</p>
<p>第二期可讀之文學理論的書甚多，姑舉出：</p>
<p>㈠藝術論　大江版</p>
<p>㈡現代文藝思潮　開明版</p>
<p>㈢新寫實主義論文集　現代版</p>
<p>㈣文學之社會學的研究　大江版</p>
<p>㈤現代新興文學的諸問題　大江版</p>
<p>㈥文藝學批評　水沫版</p>
<p>第三期可讀的關於文學創作方法的書：</p>
<p>㈠作文論　商務版</p>
<p>㈡創作的經騐　天馬版</p>
<p>㈢文學及藝術之技術的革命大江版</p>
<p>至於在各期間都應讀的文藝作品的選擇，依我們的意思：先讀現代後及往古，國人的創作和從外國翻譯過來的須兼顧。此意在前已有解說，茲不贅。現代國人如周作人，周樹人，郭沫若，田漢，洪深，丁玲，巴金，深從文：：：等：的創作；翻譯過來的如易卜生蕭伯訥等的戲曲，辛克萊，高爾基，雷馬克，綏拉菲摩維支，法捷斯夫等的小說。</p>
<p>可讀的書當然不止這幾個人的東西：但基於讀者的時間，學力等等限制，事實上是不能擬出一個大家都認爲完全無破綻的書目。讀者應記得幾年前梁任公和胡適之因擬國學書目而大打筆墨官司，終了仍無結果。但一個多方面的書目仍是有用的，雖則它是很雜的，或很不完備的。到飯店裏去吃飯飯店裏送給一張菜單，這雖則仍要聽吃客自已選擇决定，但在不大到館子裏去吃東西的人，他是點不出菜來的。</p>
<p>其次，我們談一談關於寫作上的問題。陳君提出的問題是：㈠在開始寫作之前，先規定其寫作的意義，卽中心思想，對不對？㈡寫好之後，毎毎覺得仍不能表現所要寫的十分之四，因而全部毁掉了。這種舉動應當否？</p>
<p>對於第一個問題，我們分兩層來講。第一，作品應有他的中心思想，這是天經地義。所謂中心思想便是内容，没有内容不成其爲作品，祇是我們上面說的無聊文人文字的遊戲。第二，一般作品的産生，其寫作的過程是社會的現實反映到作家的神經中樞逐漸凝成一個思想。再用具體的形象複寫到紙上：有如下表：現實↓思想↓作品作家的思想具體表現←→現實。是現實規定了你的中心思想、不是你自已可以憑空規定一個中心思想出來的。中心思想還未曾凝結於你的腦中，換句話說，你自已尙不知道寫什麽好便執筆寫了、結果是你自已經騐到的流産。</p>
<p>對於第二個問題，我們假定陳君是有了中心思想然後才着筆的，則陳君這種求全的精神是可愛慕的。這種燬稿的情形，不單是初學的人經常的現象，卽古往今來馳譽世界的文學家亦莫不有這種痛苦的感覺。（請參看三月四五六七日讀書問答：讀書與寫作）我們不好認爲這是失敗而灰心：有了求全的努力：終有一天可以爬上成功之路上去的，不過對於陳君我們還有一句得說：不滿意的稿子最好不要燬去，留着有空的時候檢視一番。慢慢一點一點的修改，有時這些東西會跟着你的經騐與技巧的增益而成材的。譬諸縫新衣，有舊衣做底子參考，新衣也較易於裁量合身些。</p>
<p>金君說：「愈是因爲地位的困難和讀書的不易、却更堅定了我底求知的意志！爲了自已，爲了整個社會的出路。我掙扎着，盡力地掙扎着：：：」這話眞使我們歡喜。惟是，在這裏，金君仍和好些讀者來的信一様，他愛文學，然而，他一方面感到像他這様的忙人，愛好文學是「高攀」，一方面却嫌文學的生活淸苦，想放棄它，奈放棄不了，這是矛盾的。如果金君和其他愛好文藝的朋友不把文藝當作「角牙之塔」内高人逸士吟風弄月的東西，那有什麽所謂高攀不高攀。文化而果與我們忙人無緣，這種文化是要不得的。旣然又把我們的求知看作爲了自已，爲了整個的社會出路而掙扎，那還有什麽好嫌淸苦的？</p>
<p>我們還是希望諸君本其初衷繼續研究。</p>
<p>有許多讀者在其來信提出某種問題之餘，向我們訴苦，說屢屢投稿到刋物上去，都没有得到發表的光榮。有許多人因此而灰心於寫作的練習了。臯蘋說：「稍爲熟習一點現在中國出版界情形的人該知道，一個無名的作家的稿件百分之九十九是得不到編輯者的靑睞的。其原因還不在無名作家之作品的「質」，不，我們的編者先生們，肯一顧無名作家的作品的實無幾人。善意的解說，我們可以說一般的編輯先生太忙了，没有時間來做「披沙尋金」的工夫：惡意的解說，則爲無名作家和編輯先生們無交情，而且「作家」無名，不足以「幇」編輯者的「忙」。有地位的作家就是「放屁」也是「香」的呀！這也就是爲什麽近年來發現了好些「海派」文人的社會根據。</p>
<p>這話雖然有點過於苛責編輯者，但也是一部分的事實。同時編輯者一面的苦衷，臯蘋君却將它放過了，我們以爲，我們不必重責人，還是自已去努力罷！</p>
<p>附啓：</p>
<p>凡來信關於文學的討論，與本文内提出的問題相似者，概請參閱本文，不另作答。</p>

<p>上場一刻鐘李寗傷出十人苦戰終局</p>
<p>西捕身高力大德飛上下時各中一球</p>
<p>東華與西捕决賽史高托杯之結果、東華不幸昨竟以零比二慘敗、功虧一簣、此史高托杯遂爲西捕所獲、上塲十五分鐘、東華爲西捕攻入一球後、後衛大將李寗亦同時足踝受傷、李從此退出、東華遂以十人苦戰終局、西捕中鋒德飛、上下兩半時各中一球、爲西捕之大功臣、昨日春寒料峭、雨絲風片、續續而來、觀衆大受影響、不過六成、五六千人之譜耳、東華慘敗、無不掃興而歸、</p>

<p>東華之失敗、李寗傷出、自爲重要原因之一、惟卽使李寗不傷、東華欲求勝利、亦爲極困難之事、西捕之身高力大實有無可如何之事、東華矮小精短者不少、戴萬賈三鋒、處處吃虧、下半時之陣線、陷於極紊亂慌張、幸周賢言門中坐守、西捕則射門不凖、否則失敗、殆至此數、前鋒萬象華尙有三四好表演、小戴因於軋許、陳洪光權充中堅、已大佳不妙、吳幼良尙滿意、馮運佑退居後衛、此調不彈甚久、球欲送不能、長時期困於暴力之下、安得不敗哉、</p>

<p>李諾斯嗚笛、西捕開球、風勢甚大、東華順風、咸爲稱幸、西捕重兵壓境、馮運佑之一勾得出、赫雷再來、在東華門前、手觸皮球退出、吳幼良遠送、賈幼良經透納之一冲而倒、賈開角球、落角甚佳、爲許德所救、吳幼良之任意球、由馮傳李義臣、賈幼良在右角猛射、爲風吹落門後、大爲可惜、</p>

<p>機會尙稱平等、西捕捲土重來、培逹射門、活根生越位、時將一刻鐘、培逹在右角猛冲、屠博士竟爲冲倒、傑克帶進、馮運佑失足、傑克已去如飛、馮運佑追之欲截送李寗、德飛同進、李寗放馬、德飛已直逼近門、李寗見事危急、奮不顧身、衝來待搶、不料雙方來勢俱猛、結果李寗球未劫着、而足踝已負傷、出塲求治、而特飛趁東華軍心動摇之際、飛騎而入、斜射一記、周賢言撲救不及、紀錄遂開、</p>

<p>｜二十九比二十四｜</p>
<p>開賽之初、雙方爭執不下、美鮑賽克因潘夢之犯規、乃得罰中一分、紀錄旣開、中華隊不甘屈復、乃由陳聚才擲中一球、並得罰中一球、美婦則連中兩球、第一節終了、美國遂以五比三導先、第二節開始、中華隊沉着應戰、首由陳榮明得一罰中、舉手擲中、美婦華拉斯又得一球、惟此隊中華主將陳榮明不甘雌伏·遂以一球還以顔色、片刻之間、陳榮明又連進二只、陳聚才亦錦上添花舉手射中、此隊乃成十比七之紀錄、中華隊一躍而居前茅、但美婦實力總是不弱、又以一球還禮、而陳榮明再以一球緊追、旣前半時將終、美鮑賽克又行擲中、如斯以十三比十二終前半塲、中華隊小挫、</p>
<p>移地再戰、中華隊愈見精彩、陳榮明首先射中、旋由美婦還中一球、其後陳榮明擲射再告成功、此際爭鬥最爲激烈、且爲勝負之關頭、故雙方無不據力急爭、如斯乃成二十一比二十之平等局面、暫停再戰、任淑與陳聚才、各中一球、第三節告終、中華隊以二十五比二一反敗爲勝、第四節開始、陳榮明籃下得球、翻身擲射、手隨心願、一舉成功、旋又由陳聚才射中一球、美婦掙扎多時</p>

<p>四十二比二十九｜</p>
<p>大戰啓幕、龍攘虎搏、雙方爭執不下、因胡正渠與陸鍾恩之犯規、美隊得先罰二分、旋馮念華得錢敬鏞之接濟、乃得執中一球、雙方掙扎多時、馮念華再得籃下球、後由陳祥龍托進一球、未幾陳宗祺調出胡正渠、番兵益加兇猛、後由孫寳慶調出陳宗祺、但仍不得手、經多時之掙扎、錢敬鏞再中一球、始得造成十二比十二之平等局面、其後馮念華再進一球、陳祥龍亦罰進一只、無奈對方不易征伏、爲其連進五分、此時之比較爲十七比十五、前半時告終、移地再戰、中華健兒、力圖恢復、但良機雖多、屢皆誤失、反爲對方得逞、加之觀衆對裁判員喧嘩不已、美隊乃由此一進再進、勢如破竹、比數愈戰愈遠、後雖由陳祥龍連中二球、聲勢得爲之一轉、無奈時機已遲、頽勢終不可挽回、最後五分鐘、中華隊一籌莫展、遂以二九比四十二之比數失敗、但男子組只中美兩隊參加、故用三賽二勝制、下次再戰、如能勝利、則尙有與美隊一决雌雄之機會、</p>

<p>— 彭翔</p>
<p>小朋友們：你們知道嗎？文章一共分四種：就是，叙事文，說明文，描寫文，和辯論文。叙事文和說明文比較容易，描寫文和辯論文比較難。現在你們學校裏敎師出的作文題目，可以說完全要你們做上面第一第二種的文章。</p>
<p>怎麽呌做叙事文呢？叙事文就是叙述一件事情的文章。譬如寫一隻故事，或者記你們一天所做的工作，都是這類文章。怎麽呌做說明文呢？說明文就是說明一様東西的文章。譬如你們敎師出一個題目呌做「狗」。你們就寫一隻狗形狀怎様，性情怎様等，這就是說明文了。</p>
<p>描寫文和辯論文你們現在還用不到，所以不講了。</p>
<p>叙事文最要緊的要有次序，照時間的先後一様一様的寫下去，切不可亂七八糟。說明文要認識淸楚，認淸楚這一様的東西爲什麽同别様不同，這様東西它自已有什麽特點等等。　　小朋友們：假使你們照上面的方法做去，不久以後，你們的文章一定會大有進步的。</p>

<p>— 劉中希</p>
<p>元朝末年，出了一個奇怪的少年，姓王名冕，住在浙江紹興府諸曁縣鄉村裏，七歲時父親就死了，他的母親是做針綫生意的，所得的錢，供給他到村學堂裏去讀書。後來因爲没有許多錢，再供給他到村學堂裏去讀書，就把他送到隔壁人家去，帮他們牧牛，毎月可得到幾錢銀子。他把毎月所得的錢，積蓄起來，等到有空閒的時候，就溜到村學堂裏，買幾本書讀讀，他常常在離開鄉村不遠的七柳湖湖邊牧牛　。</p>
<p>有一天，他把牛牽在柳樹旁邊，他自已躺在柳樹陰下讀書，忽然一陣大雨經過，那湖中的荷花葉上面像珍珠一般的雨水，滚來滚去，那血紅的太陽剛從黑雲中透出，照耀滿湖通紅，湖邊的柳樹都像洗過一番的，湖邊山上的溪水沙沙的流到湖裏來。</p>
<p>他看見這様好的景子，便想到古人所說的「人在畫圖中」一様，他想我可惜不會畫畫，不會畫出那美麗的景子來。從此以後他就一心要學畫圖，把積蓄的錢，買畫圖用的東西，後來他學到十七八歲的時候，諸曁一縣的人，都曉得他是一個畫没骨花的名手。</p>

<p>— 學范</p>
<p>上課鈴打過了，我走入敎室、滿室的小弟弟小妺妺們，都站了起來，烏溜溜的眼珠望着我。</p>
<p>我說：今天你們大家試做幾句短句子，題目是「我的媽媽」，你們各人只要說幾句關於你們自已媽媽的話。</p>
<p>孩子們都睜圓了眼睛，有的嘻着嘴笑，有的側着頭想，看他們交頭側耳，像商議什麽大事似的。徐家麟忽然立了起來：</p>
<p>「先生！我做倒能做，只是有了意思，寫不出句子」。</p>
<p>「你有什麽意思」？</p>
<p>「我想寫：我的媽媽，只愛打牌；但是牌［字寫不出。」徐家麟說完、全課堂的孩子們，都哈哈地笑了。</p>
<p>「先生！我也有意思，就是寫不出句子。」薛小玲又站了起來。</p>
<p>「你說！」</p>
<p>「我的媽媽，有皮大衣，我只有件小棉袍！」</p>
<p>「先生！我也有！」「先生！我也要說一說意思呢！」立時課堂中起了騒擾了。</p>
<p>「靜一些！靜一些！」我指了第三批上第一只位子「周天成，你先說！」</p>
<p>孩子們見周天成得了首名先說的權利，都以艶羨的眼光注視着他。</p>
<p>周大成流路着得意的微笑：「我的媽媽，有了好呢的朱古力糖的時候，總是妺妺多我少，這是什麽緣故呢？」</p>
<p>我遂問周天成旁邊的徐學詩：「你能回答周大成剛才問的緣故嗎？」</p>
<p>「我想周大成的媽媽，爲妺妺年紀小，所以多吃一些，是嗎？」</p>
<p>「對的。」我回覆他。</p>
<p>我遞次問了幾個學生，孩子們的答語，都很有趣；我爲本刋文字不宜寫得太長，也就留着不寫了。</p>

<p>— 何懿錠</p>
<p>江陰私立輔延學校六後</p>
<p>世世上無論什麽事，做的起初，總没有不「失敗」，不「挫折」的，但結果總會成功。</p>
<p>我在五前甲組時，曾讀過一篇國文，内容是：英吉利與蘇格蘭王勃羅斯交戰，勃羅斯因衆寡不敵，連失敗六次。此時良將盡亡，勃羅斯獨臥於鄉村之茅屋中。見一蜘蛛結網，也失敗六次，至第七次竟然成功。勃羅斯見此情形，大爲感動，復召舊部，再與英戰；遂復有蘇格蘭。從這一事，就可見凡大小之事，失敗後只要不灰心，肯再努力去做，是没有不成功的了。</p>
<p>我們在學校裏，各科多有月考，不及格後，自已總以爲不能升級，就此灰心，不努力用功。這是絶對的不應該的。因爲不及格，我們更該努力，不到及格不止。這様才對。</p>
<p>不但不及格要努力，及格了還要努力，切不可因爲成功了，就自已驕傲。那末，我們的學業，就可更中向前進步了。</p>

<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>｜從古代到十九世紀｜</p>
<p>在動物當中，只有人類能够取火。有了火，我們才能熟食，點燈，我們說人類得到了取火的方法，才能比别的動物進步，也不算過分。從古代到十九世紀這幾千年當中，人類取火的方法，起初不外乎「鑽」，「鋸」，「鉋」，「擊」的四種，後來方有火柴出現。右圖是表明牠的進步情形。（一）是最古的取火方法，呌做「手鑽子」。（二）是「繩鑽子」，須兩人合作。（三）是「口鑽子」。（四）是「喞筒式鑽子」。上面四種都是利用一縱一橫的兩根木頭，因不斷摩擦而發熱，使鑽下來的木屑燃燒起來，再煽成火焰。（五六）都是「引火鋸子」，把一根削成刀鋒的竹片，在另一根竹片上鋸來鋸去，使鋸下來的竹屑自燃起來，墮在火絨裏，再煽成火焰。（七）是「引火鉋」，用一根木棒在另一根木頭的槽子裏，來回地鉋着，把鉋下來的木屑聚在一起，因爲不斷的摩擦，發熱，木屑便燃燒起來。（八）是「引火銃」，在一個汽筒裏，有一個活塞很快地上下抽動着，由於空氣的壓縮，發生了足以燃着火絨的熱。（九）是黃鐵和打火石。（十）是打火器和火絨匣。以上兩種都是以「擊」取火的方法，把兩塊礦物，互相擊撞，爆出火星來，藉以取火。（十一）到了一百五十年以前，琉璜火柴發現了，不過那時的火柴，必須向燃着的火絨匣裏一點，才能發出火焰，像現代這様自已能够摩擦出火來的火柴是到了一八二六年才發明的呢。</p>

<p>（一）襪子</p>
<p>一天早上，慧兒穿錯了襪子，一隻脚上穿了一隻白襪，另一隻脚上，却是穿了一隻黑色的。</p>
<p>於是伊的媽媽告訴伊說：「慧兒，你自已看，你脚上的襪子是穿錯了，你快却換一下吧。」</p>
<p>慧兒開始發獃了，呆站着，後來自已大笑了起來，馬上走進了臥房裏去。</p>
<p>停了一刻兒後，慧兒出來了，手裏提　　　　　　　　　襪，日　　，「媽媽，呌我怎様換呢，這裏也是一隻黑一隻白的呢！」</p>
<p>（二）雨天</p>
<p>天下雨，。慧兒和敏兒從學校裏回家去，一路上兩人在急雨裏走。</p>
<p>慧兒說：「敏弟，你走快一點吧，到了家，那就好了，媽媽在焦急地盼望着呢。」</p>
<p>敏兒說：「慧姐，你呌我走快，但是走得快有什麽用呢，前邊不是也在下雨嗎？」</p>
<p>（三）手指</p>
<p>明兒一隻手上多一個手指，人家說：「明兒，你這個手指怎麽弄來的？」明兒說：「這是象牙變成的，祖母給我裝上的」，人家說，「那末，這個手指有什麽用呢？」明兒說：「應用來挖耳朶，那是再好没有的事了！」</p>

<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>小孩子對於算術，都感覺得有些困難，只要多練習，就不難克服的；俗語的「熟能生巧」，也就是這個意思。下面我介紹一件練習識數純熟的游戲，帮助小朋友們對於心算的熟練，在課餘的時候，約幾位小朋友，一起來做，是很有興味的。</p>
<p>參加游戲的人至少要在四人以上，而且最好人數不是三的倍數。游戲的時候，大家圍坐成一個圓形。游戲的地點，室内外都可以。</p>
<p>游戲的方法，很簡單。隨便由那一個人開始，往右邊輪流數着數目：「一，二，三，四，五，六，：：：」這様一人數一個數，輪流循環着數下去。不過數到「三」的數目那個人，他不能够數出聲來，他只能在桌或地上，拍一下；以下數「六」，「九」，「十二」，「十五」，：：：的，（凡是三六九的倍數）都不必數，只是拍手。譬如甲數一，乙數二，丙就不數，（拍手一下）丁再數四，戊數五，已不要數，（拍手一下），庚數七，辛數八，壬拍手：：：這様周而復始。如果那一個不應數的，忘了拍手，而數出聲來，就犯了規則，應數的不數而拍手，也算犯了規則。犯規則的處罰方不可以由參加游戲的人自已來决定，不過據我在小朋友中試騐的結果。第一次錯誤罰他站起，第二次犯規則，罰他離位繞跑游戲圈外一週；第三次罰他唱歌或講故事。這様罰法，比較適當。</p>
<p>年齡小的兒童，可以用單雙數的數目來拍，如逢偶數拍或逢奇數拍。的齡較長的，可以改用逢四，逢七：：；等部數拍，看應用時隨時變化吧！</p>

<p>— 矜細</p>
<p>冬天，野草上的露水結成了霜，霜剌痛了野草的面皮，霜阻止了野草向上發展的生機。野草們大感痛苦了。</p>
<p>勇敢的野草甲狂吼了：</p>
<p>「打倒帝國主義的霜！趕走萬惡的霜！」</p>
<p>無數的野草也學着大喊了。</p>
<p>靑草乙挿入了冷冷的問語：</p>
<p>「用什麽力量打倒霜呢？」</p>
<p>狂喊口號的野草們都默然了。</p>
<p>野草乙就貢獻意見：「我們在霜的暴力的壓迫下，我們唯一的辦法，是忍辱復仇。我們將全部養料，放在根部，充實我們實力。等到春天，乘機趕走了霜，爭取我們的自由。喊口號是枉然的，這才是我們復仇的計劃」。</p>
<p>野草們聽從了，葉子萎黃了，葉部的養料，都放到根部去，他們都凖備着忍辱復仇呢。</p>

<p>某學校裏姓張的一個學生，今年十二歲，生來非常貪嘴。同桌吃飯時，毎餐總是吃過了别人的份。一桌的人都很討厭他。</p>
<p>有一次，舉行聚餐會，張生狼呑虎嚥</p>
<p>，故態復萌。同席的李生知道他是屬狗的。故意的問他道：「請問貴庚是屬甚麽的？」</p>
<p>「屬狗」。張生答。</p>
<p>「還好」，李生接着說道：「如其是屬老虎，我們全桌的人都要給你吃下去了。」</p>
<p>張生聽了，臉上羞得赤化起來。</p>

<p>「是的，誰都有手有脚；」；我說；「不過，有手不用，有脚不動，不變做没手没脚光段子的廢人嗎？生得兩手是用的，生得兩脚是動的。我要使用我的手，做我應該做的事；我要搬動我的脚，走我應該走的路。｜｜直到我的血兒乾了，肢兒枯了！」</p>

<p>猴子居然套上紅纓帽，跳跳躥躥，引起周圍觀衆輕微的笑。</p>
<p>使猴子玩騎羊背，攢鐵圈，翻觔斗，爬高竿等的把戲。雖然猴子心内老大不願意，可是瞅到手中的皮鞭，却不敢不俯首順命了。最後，猴子機械地再被牽回塲角，打開破箱。那耍猴戲的又高聲唱道：</p>

<p>迄無向榮之象</p>
<p>雜糧現貨交易、非常淸淡、市况亦均趨下游、自紅盤至今、未見有欣欣向榮之象、昨市豆類則開肥河黃豆一車、潁州黃豆一車、均爲本街辦去、歸德黃豆一百五十包、爲福州帮採去、崇明沙黃三百包、爲廣帮辦去、歸德靑豆四百包、由福州内地分去、餘外如花生共開二百二十六包、乃</p>

<p>小黃魚爲大宗</p>
<p>最近日本漁輪之侵漁、又形活躍、上月有日本漁輪萬　丸進口、致使魚市頓形紛亂、不意該萬　丸又於前日（八日）進口、侵捕之漁獲有七百二十四箱左右、以小黃魚爲最多、約重一百三十擔、共售價二千四百餘元、而昨日（九日）又有大新丸漁輪進口、共獲漁八百箱、亦以小黃魚最多、共售價三千餘元、該項魚類聞自十六舖招商碼頭起岸、由愼豐等四家魚行代售、此次被日魚傾銷之結果、本國漁輪及冰鮮業俱受極大損失、卽當日有某某國輪進口、亦因此而損失五百餘元云、</p>

<p>— 碧雲</p>
<p>｜婚姻自由與職業自由｜　我想誰也不能否認，現代一般靑年，無論男女最切身而又最難解决的，就是婚姻與職業問題。這兩個問題在表面上雖然是「老生常談」，然而實際上，在人類的生活中却一天一天地在那裏加强牠的重要性，我們只要稍微留意一下，看看那些報紙雜誌上的小品論文所描寫的靑年們的痛苦，煩悶；和常常登載的那些靑年們自殺的消息，如果我們追溯其原因，不是爲生活所壓迫；便是爲婚姻的不自由或失戀。尤其是女子，在現社會下所感受這兩個問題的痛苦和壓迫，更爲厲害。</p>
<p>我們先從婚姻方面來說罷，所謂「婚姻自由」，當然是指戀愛的結婚而言。「戀愛」這兩個字是何等的香艶，美麗，何等的纒綿悱惻而溫柔呵！狂喜的「靑春之戀」，是一種無上的優美的藝術，是毎個靑年男女一種本能的要求，是人類靈魂的深處所發出來的一種自然之聲。但在這種一切被商品化的現社會下，這種戀愛的婚姻是很少見的。因爲在這種市儈的社會裏面，一切問題，都是以金錢爲中心，因而兩性關係的决定亦在金錢而不在愛情。没有錢的人，是不會被人愛的。一個很活潑很漂亮的靑年男子，如果他没有養活妻子的能力，在戀愛塲中多半是失敗者。在女子方面，也是一様，那些上等社會中的摩登小姐，她們有的是金錢和時間去進跳舞塲，進大學，以及其他一切娛樂塲所，有接近男子的機關，可以盡情地去享受戀愛中的快樂，那些中層社會的女子則很少有這種機會。至於都市中無數萬的勞苦女工和農村中的貧苦少女，往往因生活的壓迫而流爲娼妓，遂被迫地過那賣淫的生活，給一切她所不願意的男子去滿足肉慾，這就是她們的自由。所以在現社會裏所謂婚姻自由，也不過是有閒階級的專利品！嚴格地說來只是金錢香粉之交換的買賣自由而已！</p>
<p>至於說到婦女的職業，雖然社會各方面爲婦女開闢了許多謀生的道路，從政府機關以至銀行，郵政，電話，商店：：：都雇用女職員，但這只能容納最少數比較有社會地位和專門技術的婦女。最普遍的職業，就是投入工廠勞働和當小學敎員，那些當小學敎員的，她們的生活也日處於競爭，恐慌和不发定的狀態之中，那些當官立學校敎員的往往領不到薪金而發生生活上的恐慌；那些當私立學校敎員的，其待遇又異常刻薄，一個小學敎員，整天地不停毎月也不過得到十餘元至多三十餘元的薪金。至於那些投入工廠勞働的女工，其生活之悲慘痛苦，更是不堪言狀，毎天在那烟霧騰騰，機聲隆隆的工廠裏作到十二個鐘頭的機械工作，而所得的工資，還不够維持一個人最低限度的生活。所以那些不能維持生活的女工，以及簡直不能找得工作的婦女，都最後的被迫而當娼作妓，這就是婦女們最卑賤的自由職業。從此看來，所謂婦女的職業自由，在現社會狀况之下，其結果是不能使婦女普遍的獲得的，就是已經獲得的婦女，也不過列更招致一層壓迫而已！</p>
<p>由此看來，婚姻與職業的問題，不是一個單純的孤立的問題，是和整個的社會有密切關係的。但本文爲篇幅所限，不能充分地詳述我個人對這問題的意見。深望熱心婦女問題的男女朋友，踴躍地參加討論，並望對本文中以批評和指正。</p>
<h3 id="c277">私娼問題 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 彤華</p>
<p>爲了中外觀瞻之所在，京市當局在幾年前便廢除公娼，然而公娼雖廢，私娼却欣欣向榮。本月五日申報專電有云：</p>
<p>「京市私娼充斥，據某方調查，已逹三千人，中央醫院入春以來，花柳病者日逾百人較任何病症多十倍以上，鼓樓醫院亦同有此現象。且逐年遞增，殊屬堪慮。」</p>
<p>私娼問題之嚴重，不在乎花柳病之逐年遞增，而在乎農村經濟之大形崩潰。　　帝國主義與封建勢力雙管齊下地摧毁了中國的農村，而由人禍所造成的天災，又加强了農村經濟之破産。水草，樹葉樹皮麥苗，觀音土等便成爲農民的食品，賣兒鬻女便成爲他們舒困的辦法。在陜西，十餘齡的孤女，鬻銀一二元，苦無受主；在浙江泉州一帶，十三歲的小姑娘典五年祗需六塊錢，八歲的，連中人錢在内祇賣二十二塊，十歲的亦祇賣五十塊錢，其在廣東，因絲業破産，絲廠關門，女工失業的逹二十餘萬，爲了生活，她們便不得不流落於廣州，充當女傭或秘密賣淫了。從西北到東南，那一處不是水深火熱？在歷史上嘗負過「金粉」的美譽的南京，自然是逃不出例外的。我們看看前年無錫之搶米，揚州之騒動，蘇州商業之蕭沉和江寗的租税之繁重，（田賦毎畝要一元左右，佔全畝一年收成的四分之一）等等狀况，便歷歷可以想像出江南現在是什麽一個様子了，賣鬻兒女，是必然的，淪落火坑的女人之增多，是必然的。</p>
<p>同時，另一方面，却又需要娼妓之存在。旣是京華，求官的士人，糾糾的武將，自然集中於此。這些人們，雖則家中有「悔敎夫婿覓封候」的少婦，可是遠客他鄉，一面於他人之左抱右擁；一面，感於金陵秀色之可餐，自然是要跑上問柳尋花的道路上去，在這種情形之下，供求相應，生意那有不成者呢？仁義道德的說法，總敵不住生活的鞭笞，於是首善之區，表面上不許有公娼，然而私娼終於成爲萬目共睹的事了。</p>
<p>京市當局，是早已知道個中道理的，去年嘗一度倡議開禁。爲了收入，爲了事實已成公開的秘密，當局此舉可稱乾脆。然而婦女恊會則爲擁護女權，起而反對，並提出救濟的辦法如下：</p>
<p>（一）由黨政軍警婦女圑體各派員毎日檢查，如發現私娼，卽收入救濟院收容。</p>
<p>（二）請政府將現有之救濟院内婦女敎養所擴充以作收容救濟之所。</p>
<p>（三）由黨政軍警婦女圑體共同籌辦一大規模之婦女工廠，收容彼等入内學習各種工藝。</p>
<p>這種辦法，表面上雖說言之成理，但實際上是隔靴掻癢的。在帝國主義貨物傾銷之下，上海天津各地的工廠，减工的减工，倒閉的倒閉，原有的女工都成失業，何能創設新的大規模的婦女工廠？在國民經濟總破産之下，過剩人口一天天加多，就是各地敎養院擴充了，亦何能容納這巨量的人數？何况目下政府財政支絀，這些辦法，何能實現呢：</p>
<p>賣淫制度是現社會所必有的事情，公娼與私娼，本質是相同的。祗差者祗是法律上之承認與否而已。祗有把現社會的根本予盾取消之後，賣淫制度才能消滅。爭女權的人們啊！把握問題的中心吧！捨本逐末，結果是徒勞無功的。</p>
<h3 id="c278">國貨婦女節 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 遥</p>
<p>婦女節落到中國，靜悄悄地有如白羽毛浮在止水上。幸有幾處婦女會諸姑，舉行了聯歡大會：表演游藝，提倡國貨等等，算中國開明了的婦女，没有落在國際婦女的後塵。</p>
<p>其實在這年頭，創痍滿目，顚沛流離，審識了内外的情勢，要說爲公爲私，對我生財的話，最好是提倡國貨。我們婦女，提倡了救國的國貨，便於「三八」的今日，没有與國際婦女同調，舉行個甚麽，也並非使不得。不過可巧「三八」婦女節，也是國貨之一，我們應不能無所表示。不幸一般人竟然忽略，以爲牠是舶來的貨色，怕惹出是非而一聲不響；所以今天各地弄得這般沉寂，眞是寃枉！我并非像康聖人那様頑强的國粹派，主張無綫電也是孔子所發明；不過「過</p>
<p>三八」確是國粹的婦女哲學，現在不妨來一個膚淺的訓話。</p>
<p>何謂「三八」？</p>
<p>一是八字，婦女的年庚生日，干支八字，一過了他人的門，便是得到了「所天」；於是嫁鷄隨鷄，嫁狗隨狗，終身不必心猿意馬。</p>
<p>二是八從，父，夫，子三從之上，再加從運命，從靑天，從强權，從袁頭，從汽車；不必苦心自立。</p>
<p>三是八段，頭胸腹臀，雙手兩腿，這八項身段，頭胸腹臀，雙手兩腿，這以裸出供人評判，那她衣食住行，自然所欲從心，出入頭地；不必靠轟烈的運動，爲之護符。</p>
<p>上面這國産的婦女的「三八」，絲毫没有雜進洋貨，在這國貨年的當頭，我們可以坦然大聲疾呼的。而在這國貨的婦女節，廣爲提倡國貨，使無力的婦女，也參與救國的宏圖，鍜鍊任重致遠的工夫；這於婦女的前途，擺着無限的光榮。</p>
<p>至於洋貨的婦女節，含有不祥的鬥爭性：要喊甚麽平等，甚麽解放，甚麽提高婦女的地位，甚麽改善勞動婦女的待遇等等，於我們或者可以說牠不切時勢。倒不如提倡國貨，抵制外貨，於國家，分工合作，男子忙着肅淸内亂，長期抵抗之時，婦女便努力國貨的推銷，經濟的建設。於公盡了國民一分子之責，於私効力了國貨婦女運動。</p>
<p>所以逢「八」的紀念日，雖有九月的十八，一月的二十八等等，然而於我們，郤只有今年婦女國貨年的「三八」，最爲意味深長。</p>
<h3 id="c279">蘇聯五年計劃與婦女 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>（一）婦女對於五年計劃的努力：蘇聯五年計劃的成功，已成爲有目共睹的事實。</p>
<p>然而它的成功，絶不是和其他許多歷史上的事件一様，是由男子們一手完成的，在五年計劃勝利的過程中，蘇聯的婦女，的確表示出了非常重要的地位。　　在蘇聯，一切參加生産的婦女，　　是都市勞動者，或鄉村的農　　　　都瞭解五年計劃的任務與意義，她們對於一切的建設，都感到自已所應負的責任，以活潑的力量　看實現猛進。</p>
<p>在五年計劃一開始的時候，無論是誰，都拚命地努力着，以期逹到下列的目標：</p>
<p>（一）誰能比較的减低生産原價，</p>
<p>（二）誰能生産最好的東西，</p>
<p>（三）誰最努力不使機器空間。這種競爭的態度，由各個勞動者相互之間，男女勞動者之間，勞動者與農民之間，擴大到各個工廠，各個工業部門，以至各個都市，各個農村。在這種競爭之中，勞動婦妇做出了非常驚人的工作，例如，有一個平時一日只能生産七百二十件的勞動婦女，在競爭的第一天，便生産了九百五十四件，次日卽增至一千零二十件。</p>
<p>在工作中她們所受的待遇完全和男子一様，在同一勞動中，無論男女都是同様的工資，就是在法律方面也没有任何的差别。</p>
<p>（二）婦女敎育的進展：在實施五年計劃的過程中，蘇聯的婦女能够担負這種偉大的任務，顯然非具有相當的學識與技術能力不行。然而在蘇聯受過敎育的和的技術能力的人，確是少數，婦女尤甚。因此在五年計劃的開始，首先就是要克服這個缺點，尤其對於文盲的肅淸。一九二七至二八年，在蘇聯内能讀能寫的人，便占全人口的百分之五十三。九，到了五年計劃的末年的一九三二年，便克服了百分之八十二的文盲。</p>
<p>當然，傼僅能識字是不够的，所以蘇聯的婦女在逹到了能讀能寫的目的之後，便更進而要求獲得專門的知識，以期能在工廠經營或農業經營中勞動，並從事指導。一九二九年在蘇聯各種工業或農業的專門學校内，就學的婦女有八千八百十八人，其中百分之二十是勞動婦女。工業學校内就學的婦女有四千七百八十四人，其中百分之八十三是勞動婦女，職業學校内有婦女四千九百七十五人，其中百分之四十七是勞動者的孩兒。工廠附屬學校内有七千零七十九名女孩，其中百分之八十四是勞動者的女兒　　農村婦女也有顯著的進步。一九二九年在蘇聯高等學校的學生中，就有百分之二十一是從前從事於農業或在故鄉勞動的婦女。其他勞動者專門學校有百分　三十二的農村少女，工藝學校有百分之二十人，各種農業講習所也有百分之二十七。</p>
<p>（三）家庭生活的解放：在蘇聯急速地工業化的過程中，勞動婦女因爲參加了這種新式的生産，在日常生活方面，當然要發生巨大的變化，這種變化就是五年計劃賜與蘇聯婦女的新的解放。第一便是免除了以所有的時間來撫育子女的痛苦，在五年計劃中，凡是新創設的勞動區域，和都市裏的工廠，及勞動者住宅的近傍，都設有許多的托兒所。在住宅合作社或大住宅内，也都設有許多的幼稚園和遊戲塲，爲收容兒童之用。</p>
<p>爲减輕農村婦女的負担，在集圑農塲内也有同様的設備。凡是較大的集圑農塲，在五年末都有一千多的托兒所。在托兒所内，有人慇懃地看護着兒童，有富有學識的敎師注意着兒童的敎養，一切的生活都是規則的，適當的，可以使在工廠勞動着的母親完全放心。就是在俱樂部裏也設有兒童部，當母親把子女帶到俱樂部時，可以不致因爲孩子的攪擾，防碍了自已的休息與娛樂。</p>
<p>和撫養兒童的解放有同様重大的意義的，就是許多公共廚房的設置。這種公共廚房，有許多是設有近代技術的大廚房工廠，在這種廚房工廠内，備有極其淸潔稱意的食堂。在五年末，有四千八百個大廚房工廠，供給二千萬人口的膳食。</p>
<p>所有這些設備，無論是托兒所，幼稚園，兒童部，或公衆食堂，以及公衆洗衣所，都無非是要把家政的煩累，交給社會負担，使婦女從不能生産的勞動中解放出來，從事於生産的勞動，並進到讀書俱樂部中，以滿足其心中所燃燒着的要受敎養的慾望。</p>
<p>總之，蘇聯五年計劃的成功，是逐漸地解放了婦女有史以來的非人類的生活，而導入於自由平等的領域。</p>
<h3 id="c280">南通農村的婦女 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>我們要明白這一地方人的進化程度是怎様，可以從他們｜｜或她們｜生活方式如何來决定。近來國内對於各地風俗習慣，十分注意，雖至窮鄉僻壤，高山深谷，也想盡方法去探求：這或者不是衝動的，興趣的問題，而是整個民放前途問題罷？</p>
<p>南通是向稱模範縣，工商業都很發逹；所以有江北的上海之稱。然而，他們的生活方式怎様呢？尤其婦女們的。｜城市的婦女，另文記述，現在先將南通農村婦女的種種，拉雜於下。</p>
<p>南通農村婦女，完全被環境所支配，有她們另一種環境，卽形成她們的另一種行爲。她們是什麽環境？「盜匪如毛，民不聊生」！加以守舊性成，於是就成爲她們特殊的生活方式。</p>
<p>習性她們大概醇厚樸實，性子很和平；不喜歡遠行，愛戀着故鄉；寗可過渡苦悶生活，也不想發展；眼光很小，拿世界看得太渺茫；本來過一條長江算不得一回什麽事，她們，却以爲「懷胎婆娘，過江漢！」所以心目中只有「家」，國家和社會，是什麽東西，那是不知道的。對於自已的親族是非常愛好。</p>
<p>裝束她們的裝束，完全國粹。崇拜着「三寸金蓮，」毎個女子是要纏足的。兩隻脚膀，簡直是兩桿竹頭，走起路來，一傾一歪，好像孩提學步一様。衣着很樸素，由棉子到棉花，棉紗，棉布做了衣，穿上身，都是自已直接製造，不必借助外力。</p>
<p>婚姻，婦女們對於男女的事情，向來不公開談言；全憑「父母之命，媒妁之言；」去支配；嫁了一個好丈夫，說父母眼光遠大；如果不好的話，那是各人命運註定的。大家信着「姻緣是三千年前結成的；」對於婚姻有不滿的話，她門的口頭，是聽不到的；假使有了這個念頭，就是一種罪過。所以當丈夫不幸早死，也只得犧牲自已的靑春，守着寡；在未結婚的，也是這様。還有許多婚姻，她們在母胎裏未出來以前，已經就配合了。</p>
<p>信仰她們很信奉神，崇拜偶像。在各神當中，觀音菩薩是中心目的物。毎逢陰歷二月十九日，六月十九日，十月十九日，舉行會期，大小婦女，都事先齋戒，到這天，焚香燃燭，跪拜有加，多則數百人一集圑。她們除膜拜以外，都呶呶念着觀音經。｜｜討仙方咧！求子咧｜問卜咧｜：：：許多平時解决不了的問題，總來請敎觀音。</p>
<p>因爲南通鬧了幾年匪盜，百姓良民，被他們槍殺的很多；幸而，匪亂稍微平靜一點，所謂官兵，什麽保衛圑，也是照常搶刦殺戮；這種深刻的印象，盤旋在她們的腦際，看透了生死，簡直算不得什麽了。於是，大家更趨於消極，信奉着佛，早晚念着「南無阿彌陀佛，」以爲這世吃盡了辛酸，希望死後到西天極？樂國去享福，或者托一個好胎。</p>
<p>工作婦女們，絶對主持家庭内一切事務；烹飪洗衣，固爲其必修課；就是一家佈置，以及兒女輩及着縫紉：：：都是分内事。她們除在家中做事，還到田間作工，帮助男子。</p>
<p>地位她們絶對服從丈夫；在丈夫方面，却無所謂壓制；更有一種現象；家庭中的事情，丈夫服從妻子；家庭以外的事務，妻子要服從丈夫；乃是分工合作的辦法。</p>
<p>至於經濟，完全操在男子手裏。對於社會事務，她們没有活動的可能。</p>
<p>關於南通農村婦女的詳情細目，因限於篇幅，也只得擱筆了。讀者看了，定要懷疑模範縣的名稱吧？｜｜城市鄉村的分野在此。</p>

<p>三，思春期</p>
<p>女子的月經初潮以後，在身體上起了很大的變化。初潮是女子生殖器系統完成的象徵。</p>
<p>女子到了這時期，皮　漸形柔軟，毛髮光艶，兩頰潮紅，全身異常地豐富健美。這都是由生殖脈分泌出來的内分泌素循環在體内的所致。</p>
<p>在這時候，女子不只在身體上起了變化，同時在情操上亦有異兆。</p>
<p>到了這時期常常對鏡凝視自已在鏡中的映像，這便是對異性戀愛的第一步。她對於鏡中自已的映像，是當作戀愛的對象凝視着。但是她却在無意識中要求着眞實的戀愛對象。</p>
<p>西洋某畫家，曾畫有一個少女和鏡中自已的映像接听的畫，這是很明白地象徵一種戀愛意識，一見便會引起戀愛的感情。這種戀愛自已的衝動，呌做奈爾基斯現象。由古代希臘神話中的美少年奈爾基斯，戀愛自已在水中映影的故事而得名。</p>
<p>在少女的血潮中，高漲着的戀愛要求，對於鏡中自已的映像當然不能滿足，才轉向同性或異性的戀愛。同性愛在工廠或學校的寄宿舍内，比較容易發生，這是一種病態，如能指導得宜，則能提高女子的情操和陶治對於美的感情。反之，爲害不淺，同性愛的結果，竟因此不能與健全的異性結婚，或嫌惡結婚而度她變態的戀愛生活。也有此到有了愛人或結婚以後，會自然消失，這種變態生活這種變態的戀愛，有害無益的，爲父母爲師長者，實有爲之忠告善導之必要。</p>

<p>業餘要談</p>
<h3 id="c284">敬告業餘補習同學 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 公樸</p>
<p>一般人現在都感覺到苦悶，多半没有减除苦悶的方法。苦悶莫是減除不了麽？這或是未盡然的事；雖說在這社會未安定之前，解决苦悶，是誠非容易，不過我們若能澈底認淸社會未來的動向，說個人應如何適應現社會的方面去着想，要非絶無解决的可能，因爲苦悶之産生，是由於我們没有適應環境的辦法，有了辦法，苦悶自能減少。讀書｜是我們現在認爲可以解决這苦悶辦法的一種方法，因爲在日常生活中固然能感覺到我們環境的情形，但這是没有系統的，是瑣碎的，含糊隱約的，假若我們能更進一步的用科學方法去研究客觀現象的因果法則，則我們對於環境必能認識得很澈底，很淸晰。所以我們說的讀書不是死讀書本，乃是要用科學的精神去研究現實，我們讀書的目的不是消閒，更不是讓旁人說聲好，而是要使我們能適應或改造環境，而不爲環境所束縛，所支配。</p>
<p>本文是以一般業餘補習的同學們爲對象，上面所說的一叚，就是針對此意而發，因爲記者近來服務業餘補習學校，發現學校在開學時，各班人數極多，毎班通常總有五六十人，但後來不慢慢减少了，到學期終了，往往祇剩有二三十人，以至十餘人，這種情形尤以外國語班爲甚。我對於這種情形十分詫異，他們爲什麽要中途輟學呢？後來經我們的調查以及與他們屢次談話的結果，知道他們中途輟學的原因大約有三種：</p>
<p>（一）敎員敎授法不好；</p>
<p>（二）讀者都是有職業的人，因業餘精神疲倦或事忙，致要常常缺課，後因缺課過多，不能趕上，於是索性不讀；</p>
<p>（三）起初讀書的興趣欲望都很高，但是後來讀了幾個禮拜或二個月，覺得讀書並不是一椿易事，是需要相當時間方能有效的，於是因此便灰心不讀。綜觀以前三種原因，除第一條不成問題應由學校負責外（如現在本館所辦之學校，我們的敎員，不是過去有成績，就是經過愼重考慮而後聘請的），第二第三兩項却不是我們敎務上的缺憾，是讀者對於讀書尙無澈底的認識，所以會發生没有恒心和懈怠的毛病。因此我在上面簡單地把「讀書目的」說了一點，希望讀者增加讀書勇氣，但這裏不能詳細討論，請參看本報以前的「讀書問答」，那裏是比較有詳細討論的。（如一月六，七，兩日「論自學」；二十七，二十八，二十九三日「讀書的根本問題」；二月三日，「讀書的嚴肅性」等）</p>
<p>我們知道我們毎個人都有一種惰性作用，我們常决計要做一件事，並且也知道這事是値得　的，是不可不做的，但是後來往往因循貪懶，把那件事置之高閣起來。這是人們的通病，不足爲奇，但如果我們做事處處能用理智，有决心，這也並不是不可克復的。所以做事第一要不怕難，不貪懶。但是這固是做事的最要緊的一點，而客觀上的困難却也常能影響到做事的勇氣。如因「缺課幾次，後來再讀也趕不上」的一層，那就不是做事决心的問題，而是事實上學習困難的問題，所以我們對於這一點，經大家商酌的結果，想試行一種辦法；就是希望毎班同學都本着互助的精神組織一個互助讀書圑，其方法則爲大家公　　個程度優良並極肯服務的同學爲大家帮忙，缺課的同學對於所缺的課，不能懂得的地方，可以請求他們帮助，爲你解决困難，因爲對於學業的不了解處，敎員固應當負解答的責任，但是你缺課所生的困難却不宜在課堂上詢問，而耗費了全班的光陰。若用這種互助的方法，我們深覺受助的人當然是得益不淺，助人的人却也可借此機會使那已經獲得的智識印象更深一點，而且我們知道，我們讀書有時自已以爲都懂得了，及至旁人一盤問時却又會模糊起來，這是常有的事，的以助人者借此機會旣可檢查一下自已的讀書究竟，更可因此努力而逹到敎學相長的目的。總之這種辦法我們認爲是十分重要的事，極有益的事，所以特地提出討論，藉供業餘補習諸君及從事業餘補習敎育者的參考。</p>

<h3 id="c285">性慾的災害 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 奴魯</p>
<p>古人有言：「食色性也。」又：「飲食男女，人之大欲存焉。」感謝上帝！不但創造了人，而且又創造了「性」：不但使人饑思食，渴思飲，而且又使人到逹相當年齡時知慕少艾，發生性的饑渴。而尤其使人深長感謝之忱的，是上帝對人賞罰分明，恩威兼施。同是上帝的兒女們，但他却使有些人得不勞而獲食色最高度的滿足，而有些人則不得不力事節衣縮食，不得不過分地節制性慾和生育，也有的人甚至迫得出賣自已的「性」，以「色」去換「食」。這大概是因爲前一種人是天之驕子，應邀天賜；後兩種人罪孽深重，應受天讉的罷！</p>
<p>現在且把「食」的問題撇開不說，只談談我個人一年來「色」的生活罷。</p>
<p>有許多人把「色」視爲猥褻的事，因此，爲避免「誨淫」的嫌疑起見，在作本文的時候我極力地運用着一種嚴正的筆調。</p>
<p>我和我的妻都是薪水勞働者；我的月薪是二十元，妻毎月也可賺十五元。但兩人膳宿都須自理。而家裏又没有什麽恒産，所以生活只能勉强地過去。所差强人意的，就是，我們結婚一年來，到現在還没有一個孩子，這是我們所常引爲幸事的。</p>
<p>妻是一個古怪的人。她和有些女人一様不想有孩子，甚至一聽見别人家孩子的哭聲，心裏就焦燥煩亂起來。我也從來没有看見她抱吻過任何人的孩子，她不喜愛這様的做，也没有這種需要。在她腦子裏彷彿只有「作事」和「賺錢」兩件事是她所常常想到的，生活的鍜鍊使她天賦的母性漸漸地消失了！</p>
<p>至於我呢？也不想有孩子。不過，我並不是不願有孩子，實在是因爲環境不容許我有，使我不能不用盡種種的方法，去過分地節制性慾，節制生育。</p>
<p>我曾經這様的想過：假使我的妻子一旦有了孕，有了生育，那她至少須有兩個月不能作事，這様，卽使她自已不向公司裏提出辭職，公司裏也要把她說職了。若找人代理，或請長假，那顯然是不能獲得他們的允准的，她是只有失業了。要知道生活是一件嚴重的事。旣失了業，則將來待身體復原之後若再想另找事做，那就很困難的了。而且，孩子是需人提携和撫養的；無論你出工資雇奶媽也好，或是由做母親的抛棄謀生</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>的職業，去實行「賢母良妻主義」也好，你總得加上一筆生活上很大的負擔，總得犠牲一部分有限的收入。這様，所謂「小天使」，一經我們窮小子眼光的化騐，也就立刻變成了討債的「活鬼」。像這様的「活鬼」，只要有一個也已足以制我們的死命，更不必說是希望「多子多孫」，「兒孫滿堂」了！</p>
<p>孩子是一種災害，性慾是這災害的根源，而「窮困」又是這災害的根源的根源。在我們新婚的第一夜，這災害的恐怖就嫉妬似的威脅着我們，然而，還好，這一夜並没有種下孽根。後來我們也就採行分床制，一面在書報上留心着關於避孕法的文字。</p>
<p>也不知從什麽報上看到一段這様的材料，說是從前回月經開始後第十六日起，至次回月經開始時止，共十三日，爲不受孕期，在這期間内危險性要算最少，這方法是經我們採用了。</p>
<p>其實，我們就使在所謂「不受孕期」、</p>
<p>内，毎月最多也只敢同床一次，而且，我們也不敢盡量的放肆，深恐就此種下了孽根。這無怪妻有一次要對我這様的說了：</p>
<p>「不知怎的，我總覺得你這個男人好像不是我自已的男人，而是和偸來的一様。」</p>
<p>妻的話是不錯的。一個苦女子有了窮丈夫原是和没有的一様。幸而我們並不「飽暖」，因之也就不常「思淫」，毎天工作的疲勞，把我們這種生理上的要求統制鎭壓下來了！</p>
<p>雖然我毎次是那様的小心翼翼，可是、事實上，這顆心我還是放不下。毎次我總是這様的懷疑着：「不曉得這一次會不會種下孽根？在不受孕期内眞</p>
<p>的可以不受孕嗎？」我整天提心吊膽的煩慮着，一不安」佔據了我全個的心，連做事都没有精神了。一次的放縱實在還抵償不過十天二十天愁悶擔憂的損失！</p>
<p>晚上，當我從公司裏回家，遇到妻也回來時，我常常要這様的問她：「你月經有來了嗎？」假使回答說「還没有來」，那我就更懷疑了：「大概經期還没有到嗎？還是已種下孽根呢？」我焦急煩燥着，心更是不安了，彷彿我已看到胎兒在她肚腹内蠕動着，事情是更嚴重的了。這様，總要等到有一天她告訴我說：「來了！」我纔完全安心下來了。</p>
<p>感謝上帝！直到現在我還没有一個孩子。我希望將來也不會有。在現社會制度之下，爲着生活的緣故，我寗願做一個「無後爲大」的不孝的人！</p>
<h3 id="c286">滿室生春的黃昏 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>

<p>一個面貎兇狠手内拿着竹片的大個子，喝令他把褲帶襪帶解下丢在地上；在他全身搜摸了一遍之後，就把他生菜碗様粗大柱子的柵門内一推，嘩喇一聲把門鎖了。</p>
<p>「老玉！你怎麽也來了？」小陳在地上爬起來苦笑着問道。</p>
<p>他望了小陳一眼，一面輕輕地回答小陳一聲，「你來這裏好久了？」一面就在擺放馬桶的正對面一個角落裏坐下，雙手抱着自已的頭俯伏在膝上，一聲也不響。</p>
<p>「開飯了，這位新來的同志不要急，吃點飯再說。」麻皮阿三挨近他的身旁說着，同時拿了一隻鉛皮飯碗和一雙筷子給他。</p>
<p>他也不睬不理。他在默想他今天出門的時候，他的老婆抱着纔生兩個月的海兒，倒在床上，唱着單調的催眠曲情景，此刻也說不定還在盼望他借到了錢回去買米哩。他不知不覺熱涙縱橫滿面了。麻皮阿三見他這種神情，說道：「好！看你能够幾餐不吃飯。眼涙流成了河也没用的哪！」小陳接着說：「初進來這内面的人，都是心急的，不能吃東西，讓他睡一下吧。」</p>
<p>他摇摇頭，表示也不想睡；並問小陳：「有法子送個信出去嗎？」</p>
<p>「要看機會，如果有人開釋出去，可託其帶信，不然，就要五塊錢，請掃地的那個矮子設法送去。」</p>
<p>他聽着這些話默然了。抬頭望望牆壁上，詩，聯語很多，還貼着一張油印的某某人的宣言，被臭蟲血糊得看不淸了。他們吃過了飯，都圍做一　坐着。麻皮阿三呌道：「老玉｜來聽老同志講故事吧！」但他只點點頭，仍然没有坐攏來。這位所謂老同志約莫四十歲左右，額紋很深了，一望就曉得是個飽經了風霜的人。他們逼着這位所謂老同志，講幾年來所謂地下生活的情形，但他講了之後，總要來一點傷感的話。麻皮阿三是個目不識丁摇櫓的船夫，他聽了所謂老同志所講的事情，最喜歡提出一二個問題來和别人討論，討論到高興起來了，就得意洋洋，大聲喧鬧，直到　門外掮着槍的人喝一聲「肅靜點！」這麽一來，纔得停歇。</p>
<p>這一間不滿一方丈的房子，要睡二十多個人，當然是縱橫陳列，擠得骨頭作響；要是半夜起來小便的，那一起來就莫想再能擠下却了。他到這裏第一晚，心頭一陣陣作疼，毫没睡意。倒在角落裏扯隻髒得發黑光的被角蓋了下身，大約到了黎明時候，始朦朧入睡。當飛機勃勃的聲音掠屋頂而過時，小陳把他推醒了：</p>
<p>「老玉，八點鐘了，快要點名了，起來吧！」</p>
<p>他於是起來坐着。不料看見對面第四號房内一個四五歲的孩子，看見别人吃油條，向着他父親吵着也要吃油條。他又想起自已在家内的大孩子了，毎天早晨跟着他去泡開水，定要買一根油條或蟹黃壳的，今天不知怎様了。想到這裏眼涙幾乎又出來了。</p>
<p>點過了名以後，陸陸續續的呌去了不少的人，有的仍含着眼涙口裏呻吟着回來了，這不問而知是受了拷打的；有時男男女女排成一隊出去，仍然排隊回來，這是照像打手模的；有時男男女女排成一隊，另用兩根繩子兩邊攔着走出去的，這是解到别的機關去辦的。他望着這些來來去去的人，呆想出神，一直到開晚飯了，小陳給他一點鹹蛋，他始吃下了一碗飯。</p>
<p>麻皮阿三吃完了晚飯，獨自站在柵門縫口内，兩隻眼睛時时向外瞭望，不一刻，手舞足蹈地喊着：「啊呀來了！我的乖乖，今天更見俏哩！」這時滿房的人的視綫都射向柵門外了。原來毎天黃昏，這個短髮覆額身段婀娜年祇十八九的小妹，要到各個房間倒馬桶的。當她開鎖進柵門内來的時候，大家嬉皮笑臉起來了，室内充滿了一片「妹妹我愛你」，「我的歪夫，爲什麽纔來」的聲浪，彷彿大地一切愁慘氣象，被春風一吹，化成萬紫千紅的燦爛美景了。</p>

<h3 id="c287">鷄生蛋乎？蛋生鷄乎？ <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 從木</p>
<p>當「是鷄生蛋，還是蛋生鷄？」這問題被提出來時，一般所謂名流，學者們便要摇着頭說：「這是很神秘的問題，永遠都是不能解决的。」其實問題本身並不神秘，神秘的只是這些名流，學者們的腦袋。在他們的神秘的腦袋之下，便是鷄生蛋，蛋生鷄，蛋生鷄，鷄生蛋；至於誰先誰後，那便只有天曉得·</p>
<p>誰都知道，鷄是一種生物，蛋則是這一生物的胚胎，依據生物學，胚胎是旣成的生物所形成，産生的。所以，我們對問題的回答是：鷄生蛋。</p>
<p>不過，這様依然是形式的理解；而且，如果只是很形式地這様回答，亦是帶着神秘的色彩的。因爲倘若只說「鷄生蛋」而不談鷄之來源，那便很易使人反過來說「蛋生鷄」，否則鷄是從何而來的呢？上帝創造的嗎？神秘！</p>
<p>逹爾文告訴了我們：一切已成的生物，都是由於在宇宙的形成過程中所出現的某一小的生命漸漸進化而來的。鷄是生物，其形成過程當然也不能與生物進化的鐵則違背，它絶對不是上帝創造的。依據一般常識，鷄是一種家禽，其前躵必然是一種野鳥，後來經了人類的長期豢養，才漸漸純善起來，因「用進廢退」的關係，其羽翼才漸漸地失掉了飛的作用，於是，才漸漸地形成了現在的鷄的形態。至於形成鷄的這種野鳥，當然也是由於在太初形成的某一小生物進化而來的。所以，根本說來，鷄是在宇宙的形成過程中所出現的某一生物進化成的。</p>
<p>蛋是已成的鷄的胚胎，更正確地說，就是隨着一切生物之進化而進化成的鷄的胚胎。在這意義上，只是在這意識上，我們才可以說先有已成的鷄，然後才有作爲鷄的胚胎的蛋，是鷄生蛋，不是蛋生鷄。</p>
<p>於此恐怕有人要問：所謂鷄之前身的野鳥，也必然是蛋産的，那麽，我們不是可以說鷄是蛋産的嗎？這是很容易解答的。第一·産生鷄之前身的野鳥的蛋，不是鷄蛋；第二·如上所說，一定要先有生物，然後才會有生物之胚胎，同様，一定要先有野鳥，然後才有作爲野鳥之胚胎的野鳥蛋，所以，就是野鳥，也是先有其本體，然後才有作爲其胚胎的蛋；於是第三·還是先有鷄，後有蛋。如果還要究極時，要由鷄與蛋之關係，由野鳥與野鳥蛋的關係，追求到原始生物之起源時，那便只有歸之於運動着的物質了。這様，問題不僅一點也不神秘，而且是可以科學地解决的。</p>

<p>— 裴立俠</p>
<p>北平通訊　　只要在北平住過幾年底人，對於這灰色的故都，在腦筋中總會留一個很深底映象的。因爲，人們在這裏，不僅可以看見平靜而淡恬的生活環境；同時，由於北平是一個歷史上故都的關係，所以，人們在這裏還可以從環境中去了解過去的中國和過去的東方文化的殘影！</p>
<p>近幾十年來，雖在西方文明不斷地衝擊着這古老的都市，可是，我們在這衰頽的都市中，仍可隨處發現那古老文化之遺跡的。</p>
<p>譬如說：那巍峨的帝宮，那優美的林園，那盛開着五月荷花的御河，以及那松柏陰森的太廟，這些，那一様不會給人以深刻的映象？那一様不會使人去追考過去的中國？｜｜｜不僅這些，甚至在一些很小的飲食起居上，都是這様的。</p>
<p>倘若你不信，我還可以舉出一些簡單的事實。譬如關於飲食方面。</p>
<p>北平的許多飯館，往往都是有很悠久底歷史的，其中最著名的，特别是東興樓和沙鍋居。</p>
<p>東興樓在東城東安門大街的路北，據說牠從淸代以來開到現在，已經好幾百年了。這個飯館的表面，非常之古舊，矮矮的平房，灰黑灰黑的表面，建築自然是好幾百年前的舊様式，光綫旣不好，空氣又不流通，裏面的一切陳設，總是一些紅木方桌，平床，和椅凳，據說這裏面的廚子，是以前的御廚子，現在掌灶的也就是以前替宣統做菜的。因爲這種關係，於是東興樓便成爲許多逹官貴人宴客之所了。在這古舊的建築物底門前，經常的停有很多的汽車，而這裏面的菜也特别的高。聽說，有位御廚子的價錢也特别的高。聽說，有位御廚子，在這裏毎日只炒「雪花鷄鬧」一様菜、而一目的薪水却有一百多元，自然，其　的也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>此外，還有一個沙鍋居。這是比較平民化一點的。這裏只賣猪肉和猪肚腹内的東西。菜並不多，但是却很出名。出名的原因，不是因爲菜的關係，主要的是因爲牠底歷史。據說這個館子是明朝以來就開起的。牠裏面墩湯的沙鍋是明朝就傳下來的，這沙鍋裏面，從明朝以來，因爲不斷的加水進去，從事没有乾邊，所以，倘若你現在去吃牠底湯，還可以吃到明朝遺傳下來的湯，或許吃到明朝的湯中之若干萬萬分之一，同時，牠煮飯的米是以前御田底米。由於這種歷史的傳說，許多人對於這個沙鍋居總是趨之若然。張宗昌極盛時代還曾在此大宴過賓客。</p>
<p>在好久以前我也爲這一有趣的傳說所動、便同兩個朋友到西四北大街去訪問這「明朝的湯」。我們找了半天，終於找着了這個地方。這裏是極矮的兩三間平房，高度，充其量不過一丈多點，門口懸了一個已經腐朽得不能辯認的招牌。裏面則另有兩個小招牌寫的是：「京都第一」「並無分號」。我們走了進去，在很窄的房間裏，占據了一張白木方桌。這裏除了光綫不好，空氣不流通的特點外，還有，就是：跑堂的全是六七十歲的老頭子。只要你一呌他，他總是躬着了腰，慢慢的和你週旋。</p>
<p>就在這裏，我們吃了以前皇帝吃的米，也喝了所謂「明朝的湯」｜尤其是把我們扔到了幾百年以前的地方去重遊了一次。</p>
<p>儘管時代是如何的在飛跑，北平却還是在各方面都殘留有古老的東方文化的殘影。在這裏，不僅有電車和汽車，却還有皇帝的廚子和明朝的湯，這些用不着歷史博物館去搜集，他自然而然地就陳列在那裏的。</p>

<h3 id="c289">怎様研究目前的貨幣問題？ <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 堅甫</p>
<p>｜幾本入門書的介紹｜</p>
<p>最近因爲美國的通貨膨脹，收買黃金，提高銀價等事情，以致許多好學的靑年都弄得目迷五色，莫知所從。看報紙固然是只能够曉得一點事實，而閱雜誌，買書籍，亦復找不到適於胃口，合於消化的入門途徑。關於這，不但是我們許多業餘靑年摸不到頭腦，就連許多大學生，大學畢業生也是不甚清楚。前兩天申報的「讀書問答」欄内曾經有一個人寫信問讀書指導，而結果讀書指導所答的，僅是關於一般經濟理論的入門書；對於這當前急待解决的貨幣問題，却只介紹了一本希爾費丁的「財政資本論」。我想這一定是不够的，何况那部「財政資本論」又是一部很艱深專著。</p>
<p>那麽到底怎様纔能解决這個問題呢？｜這確非一言兩語所可竟事。與其在這兒長篇大論地談論一氣，我想還不如向讀者介紹幾要淺近的書籍來得簡便此。</p>
<p>首先要聲明的是，在中文方面的書籍，又淺近又有系統的很少，如果讀者比較有人閑的時間，可以買一本朱彬元著的「貨幣銀行學」來讀一　，再，能够買一本高橋　吉著，施周合譯的「實用經濟學」讀一讀，那當然更好（主要地是讀牠的第二篇）。假使没有許多的餘暇，那天買一本萬有文庫的「經濟常識」讀一讀，也總不無小補。</p>
<p>上述的幾本書，雖然可以供初讀者的參考，然而理論上都免不了相當的歪曲。不過爲了急於瞭解目前的貨幣現象的朋友們着想，這也是没有辦法中的辦法。</p>
<p>在英文方面。雖然關於貨幣問題的敎育書和專著也很多，可是要想於最短期間洞觀目前的國際貨幣問題，那却是非常困難。好在最近有幾種很淺近的書已經出版，讀者不妨一讀。</p>
<p>一年來，因了美國貨幣政策實施的結果，不但是專家和學者們在爭論，就是一般的美國平民，對這問題也起了極大的注意。爲了應付一般民衆的需要，於是許多通俗的貨幣整理論書乃應運而出。現在就其中比較完善而且已經來滬的書籍介紹四種如下：</p>
<p>（一）“DollarsandSenseOuesrionsandAnswersinFinance"byBrant'</p>
<p>Ｒ｜｜這一本書是用問答的體裁編著的。對於貨幣的金融的以至財政的一般問題與理論都有簡明的解釋。讀了這本書，可以對於目前在國際上鬧得萬馬奔騰的貨幣問題得到一個概括的認識。</p>
<p>（二）"ThePrimeroffnflationbySparlingE||本書是關於「通貨膨脹」的一本很淺近的書，我們在報紙雜誌上所看到的「收買黃金」，「貶低金元」，「提高銀價」等等，花様雖多，要不過爲通貨彭脹的支派，明瞭了通膨脹的本質，對於這些旁支自然可以迎刃而解。</p>
<p>（三）"Tnflation",bywoodwqrd＆Ｒose｜｜在通俗的程度上，與上面的一是「通貨安定」。我們讀了他們反對通貨膨脹的理由之後，對於貨幣問題的眞相當更能明瞭。這書對於已往的貨幣膨脹我貨幣收縮的歷史也有很完整的叙述。　（四）"SilvoriAnAoalysisofFactorsAffectingLt'sprice",byLeong,YＳ．｜｜最近不是正鬧着銀價問題嗎？那麽要瞭解以往的和目前的銀子問題，銀價問題等等，這書是値得一讀的。</p>
<p>以上四種　，前三種訂價都是美金一元一角，最後一種是美金二元。合國幣，前者不及五元，後者約六元半。價錢確是貴了一點，最好是幾個人合資買一本，或者請求接近的圖書館訂購。</p>
<p>最後附帶說一句：美國書終於是美國書，前面幾個作者的主旨幾乎都是站在爲讀者的生意。爲讀者的財産着想的。因此，這些書雖然能够帮助我們去認識現象，却不一定是最正確的理論書。假如有暇，讀者最好去買一本Ｅ.Beros“TbeOnlyWayOdt，來讀一讀。對比之下，那你所把到的東西纔眞是　一無二的「陸稿　」呢。</p>

<h3 id="c290">安業與樂業 <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 雪菲</p>
<p>現在有些人都勸人要安業與樂業。安業是得到了職業後對於現有職業要安心去做，不要見異思遷；樂業是得到了職業後對於現有職業要發生興趣，不能隨隨便便的過了一天是一天，或是發生厭惡。這是對現在一般對於現狀發生不滿的人而說的·在現在情形之下，一般人得到職業尙且困難，有了職業，無論是好是壞，已經是萬分幸福了，要再不安業與樂業，那豈不是等於自尋死路，這當然是要不得的。因此，『安業與樂業」這話頭在現在就更見有力。</p>
<p>然而現在的問題，却不在「安業與樂業」，而是在業無可安，業無可樂。安業與樂業，牠的前提條件，至少要這個業是可以安，可以樂，就是說，他從事於這個職業，至少要能够維持生活，至少要能够利用工作餘閒，發揮他的天才，再力圖上進，設法增加他的知識技術能力，來發展這個職業。這様，他對於這個職業，才能安，才能樂。然而現在能不能呢？事實上是絶對不可能的。我們看見，有許多人是終日勤勞，而結果仍不能維持一家生活，甚至於個人的生活：仍不能不負債。這様，呌他對於這個職業，能不能安呢？這是一。有了職業倒也罷了，而無奈在這個社會之中，朝晚變遷不一，任何一項事業，隨時都有破産覆滅的危險；還有，老板的一喜一怒，也隨時可使職業發生動摇，這様，職業又永久在不固定的狀態中了。人惟日夕謀保持位置之不暇，呌他又怎様去安業呢？這是二。其次，現在的職業大概都是牛馬式的，就是毎天要把所有的精力都主到職務上去，這様才能勉强博得個　溫半飽，否則，老板後面立着的，都是些找職業的人，他不難立刻把你換掉，另外找一個肯更多出賣勞力的人來的。這様，你就再也没有剩餘的時間可以用到自修上來了，知識技術，休想再增進一步，望着前途，老是空虚與遼遠。還有，所學非所用，爲着吃飯，對於自已所不發生興趣的職業，也不得不去就，這也很多。在這情形之下，請問呌他們又怎様去樂業呢？安業與樂業的前提條件，旣然不備，安業與樂業的效果，當然是無法可以得到的了。</p>
<p>所以，，現在的問題，不是在安業與樂業，而是在怎様可以安業，怎様可以樂業。這前提條件不能解决，什麽安業與樂業的話頭都是空的。</p>
<p>然則，怎様才可以解决這個安業樂業的前提條件呢？這是一個大問題。</p>
<p>還有，現在一般人總呌人要勤儉刻苦，那當然是是再好也没有的了，但可惜這也是空的。現在要找到一個職業，已有如登天之難，幸而找到了，要勉强藉以維持生活，也還是一様登天之難。在這様情形之下，勤儉刻苦，當然也都無從說起的了。</p>
<p>無職業的要找職業，有職業的不能安業樂業，我們向何處去呢？這混亂的社會！</p>
<p>之演講</p>
<h3 id="c291">章友三講「靑年修養的途徑」 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 沈聘記錄</p>
<p>（甲）認識自已我們要認識自已的缺點和長處，一面去改革缺點一面去發展長處。在靑春時期，身體各部器幹都發育成熟了，正是一倆人奮發有爲去努力時候，這時，在精神方面有三特點：一衝動行爲，在靑春時期，時時有一種力量去督促他行動，因爲兒童時代是力量，智識，身體都不够去行動，在老年時期，因入世已深，閱歷豐富，處處都要顧到各方利害，故而少動。二利他，他的衝動行爲是利他，而不是自私的。三社交豐富，他不但利他，而且是要和人多多來往交際。但是衝動是不久的，散漫的，我們應當訓練成爲持久的，有組織的正當行動。利他，要養成急公好義的精神。社交，要訓練到能够與人合作，更須瞭解全部的人生觀。</p>
<p>（乙）認識民族　現在時常可以聽到一句時髦語：「發揚民族精神」，但中國的民族精神有好的，也有壞的。現在且舉出中外三名人的觀察點來代表中國的民族精神。梁任公說中國的民族精神特點有六：一奴隷性，二愚昧，三好僞，四自私，五散漫，六好利。日本的大板修方說有八：一信命運，二忠孝，三文弱，四好利，五自私　，六保守，七有趣味，八矛看。美國人亨定頓說有七：一缺乏組織力，二自私自利，三勤苦耐勞，四惰性，五虚僞，六忠孝，七保守。綜合三人觀察，中國民族有二個最大的缺點；一自私自利，二好保守，少進取心。日本荒木陸相對國際聯調查圑說；中國人好像沙，是不能合起來的，日本人是士敏士，有圑結力的。日本人一提起了大日本，就有一種了不得的精神。最近有一位敎育名人竟說：「多一事不如少一事」。這一種得過且過的精神，是中國最普遍的特性。講到外人所說中國人酷愛和平，這種和平是用以對外的，一日兵臨城下就講和平，至於國内自已人呢？只要看在上海的公共汽車在路上行駛，前面的黃包車讓慢一點，就一聲猪　，假使黃包車夫回他一句，他說不定要走下來和他打一塲，這種情形在中國是到處可以見到的。又如中國的最好精神克苦耐勞，到現在也要慢慢的退化了，故我們要修養中國民族所需要的民族精神。</p>
<p>（丙）認識時代　我們應當（一）注意眞實思想（卽科學的精神與方法），以客觀的態度來觀察，放棄主觀的玄虚思想。（二）注重大衆福利，希臘有句古語：「人爲萬物凖則」，現在讓我們來補充一句，就是，這人一定要爲羣衆謀福利，爲民族的。</p>
<p>商湯有語云：「苟日新，日日新，又日新」，這種自强不息的進取精神實可資我們效法。現在世界各國提倡「物競天擇」，競爭這個名詞，一面進取，一面殘害同類，完全是自私的行爲，就是弱肉强食，我們應當提倡合作，「我爲人人，人人爲我。」合作是最現代的，最完美的，最普遍化的修養。</p>
<p>總之，修養的目的是要養成一個社會化的人格，社會的福利就是我的福利，没有小我，只有大我，將社會和我打成一片，修養是要爲社會而修養。歌德說得好：「好的品格，决不是在自私自利的觀念中修養得到的」。我們要根本去剷除病根，以客觀的態度來觀察自已。盧騒說：「要養成客觀的態度，須對事業的各方面發生興趣」。比仿演說，不要時時注意自已的姿勢，動作，態度，須把全副精神去注意聽衆，而忘了自已，養成偉大的人格，是要爲人類，爲社會去努力，不能含有怎様提高我的希望，這者是最高的修養。最後一句話：是說了要做的，要知行合一。</p>

<p>Chiang Ting-wen carries Chairman Chiang's personal letters to Chen, Hu, etc.</p>
<p>Chairman Lin and the heads of various Yuan (Councils) all send letters to Hu Hanmin urging him to come to Beijing</p>
<p>It is said that Hu Hanmin has changed his attitude</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Ting-wen's mission to Guangdong is extremely beneficial to the current situation. Chiang carries several personal letters from Chairman Chiang to Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Yu Hanmou, Li Yangjing, etc., and to Hu Hanmin, Zou Lu, Deng Zheru, Xiao Focheng, Tang Shaoyi, etc. The letter to Chen concerns soliciting his opinions on the overall plan for future bandit suppression campaigns by the various routes of bandit suppression armies against the Communist bandits in Jiangxi and Fujian, and on unifying the national military system. As for the letter to Hu, it explains the past misunderstandings of the Southwest members of the Central Committee towards the Central Government, and the Central Government's various plans to reorganize the situation in the Southwest, seeking to exchange views with Hu and others for separate implementation. Chairman Lin, President Wang, President Sun, President Yu, and President Dai also have three jointly signed letters, which were handed to Chiang to bring to Guangdong and forwarded to Hu, Chen, Li, and Bai. It is reported that the letters from Lin, Wang, etc., to Hu urge him to come to Beijing as soon as possible, and briefly express the opinions of the various authorities of the Central Government on the issue of his future whereabouts. It is heard that the motivation of Lin and Wang's letter to Hu was in response to the request of Chen in Guangdong, because Chen recently telegraphed the Central Government, stating that Guangdong's support for the Central Government is indeed sincere, and that if the Central Government devises a way to welcome Hu to Beijing and cooperate with the Central Government, then Guangdong can make further expressions to the Central Government. Lin, Wang, and others previously sent a private telegram to Hu in their personal capacities, inquiring about his intentions. Now Hu, feeling that his views on the current situation have not been very common in the past two years, plans not to stubbornly adhere to his own opinions in the future and to insist on things. Therefore, he resolutely changed his attitude, recognizing that the opinions of Lin, Wang, and others can be discussed and consulted. After Chiang Ting-wen brought the letters to Guangdong this time, Hu immediately sent his wife, Chen Shutian, and daughter, Mulan, as representatives to the provincial capital to convey Hu's opinions. It is heard that his expression is still close to the Central Government, but regarding the matter of coming to Beijing, he stated that he must wait until the Central Government's plan for reorganizing the Southwest party, government, and military issues is determined and considered satisfactory before he can make a decision. As for the issue of the existence and abolition of the two Southwest organs, he advocates that the two organs convene a joint meeting of all members to base decisions on the majority's opinion. He himself has no fixed opinions and no strength to contend for their retention. It is heard that Chiang and Chen have also telegraphed Hu's opinions to Lin, Wang, Chiang, and other authorities.

<p>Rumors of Recognition are Completely False</p>
<p>Peru Also Makes a Firm Statement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic news: Previously, a certain party publicized that Germany would recognize the puppet organizations in the Eastern Provinces. Our government, considering the matter strange, immediately ordered Liu Chongjie to question the matter nearby. The German Foreign Minister officially replied to Ambassador Liu on the 7th, stating that Germany still holds its usual attitude towards the Manchurian issue, which proves that the previous rumors were propaganda with a certain purpose. (10th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) News from diplomatic circles: The puppet state of Manchukuo issued multiple communiques in one day,妄希 seeking international recognition. All countries ignored them. The Peruvian government has now also firmly stated that it will abide by the League of Nations resolution and consistently support our side, and will never recognize any political system of the puppet state. Regarding the puppet state's communique, it only instructed its acting agent in Japan to inform the puppet representative of the reasons why the Peruvian government cannot recognize it.

<p>(Hong Kong) Mou Weide, a member of the League of Nations Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, said that his visit to China is to investigate higher education and inspect labor conditions. He will take a boat north on the 13th, first to Nanjing and Shanghai, and then to Peiping and Tianjin. It is purely unfounded to say that Japan will attach the issue of puppet Manchu labor when the International Labor Bureau convenes a conference in May. Because all countries still maintain a non-recognition attitude towards puppet Manchu, the conference will never accept any of its proposals. (10th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>It is reported that Zuo Yi and others Arrive in Baotou to Discuss Plans to Suppress Sun</p>
<p>(Peiping) Fu Zhan Kui telegraphed Peiping on the 7th, saying, "I am going to Dengkou this morning. It is expected that it will take three more days to meet Sun. Because vehicles cannot pass west of Dengkou, it is difficult to replace them with camels and horses. Progress is so difficult. I will telegraph again after meeting Sun." (10th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A senior staff officer said, "The Central Government originally did not want to use force to sanction Sun Dianying. The Peiping Military Branch sent personnel to contact him for peaceful measures this time, but Sun still has no concrete expression. Peace has been declared hopeless."

<p>(Peiping) Fu Zhan Kui arrived in Dengkou to wait for Sun Dianying to meet, but Sun has not replied. If Sun does not arrive before the 15th, Fu will leave Dengkou and return to Peiping to report. Sun has no sincere intention of repentance and is still leading his troops to attack Ningyuan fiercely, and ordered his troops to capture Ningyuan before the 15th. After Fu Zuoyi, Wang Jingguo, and Zhao Chengzhu arrived in Baotou, they have been discussing military plans to suppress Sun's army for days. It is heard that the vanguard of the Jin-Sui Army will cross the Yellow River today and tomorrow and approach Dengkou to exert pressure on Sun's troops.

Lu requested to reorganize a brigade, which has not yet been decided. However, the authorities have already devised a method. Sun himself is quite willing to leave the army, hand over his troops, and wait for reorganization. However, because he is surrounded by Liu Yueting and others, he cannot get rid of them. If Sun does not leave the army in the future, Lu's troops will make some expressions. At present, there are still Sun's troops stationed from Sanshenggong to Dengkou. (10th dispatch)</p>

Although the authorities here are actively preparing for military action to deal with Sun's troops, they still hope to resolve the issue peacefully. If Sun can leave the army, all problems can be easily solved. Sun and his subordinates have a long history of relations, or will not allow him to leave. It is reported that Li Ming has met with Sun, but the details are unknown. Whether Sun accepts their proposals will be determined after meeting with Fu. Pang Bingxun has returned to Zhumadian.

<h3 id="e20">The Most Superior Navy Proposal of the United States: Caution <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The U.S. Senate passed the most superior navy shipbuilding proposal, already approved by the House of Representatives on January 30th, by a majority of 65 votes to 18 on March 7th. This proposal was introduced by Mr. Vinson, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee. The shipbuilding program includes one 8-inch gun cruiser, five 6-inch gun cruisers, one 15,200-ton aircraft carrier, 65 destroyers, and 30 submarines. The construction cost is estimated to be between 565 million and 1 billion U.S. dollars. At the same time, it is also planned to add 1,182 aircraft at a cost of 95 million U.S. dollars. The purpose of this proposal is to make the U.S. naval power comply with the limits stipulated in the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty. Such a large expenditure on the construction of naval and air forces, especially when the economic panic has not yet been overcome and international relations are deteriorating, will undoubtedly have a significant impact on all parties.</p>
<p>From the World War to 1928 and 1929, the economic development of the United States was indeed unprecedented. It transformed from a debtor nation to a creditor nation and became the world's leading power. Not only did heavy industry, financial investment, and the chemical industry experience considerable growth, but also the rayon industry, which has the characteristics of light industry, made significant progress. With the expansion of the American industrial power as it is, it is bound to think of ways to protect it. What is the way? On the negative side: First, it must not fear the enemy's blockade. Maintaining the communication channels in the Pacific Ocean is especially urgent. Second, it must be able to cover the transportation of its wartime military supplies and the acquisition of necessities. Third, it must be able to ensure the safety of its territories, including the Philippines, Guam, Hawaii, and Alaska. On the positive side, first, it must rely on bloodless economic struggles as a preparation for armed struggles, thereby demonstrating the strength of the United States and deterring its hypothetical enemy, Japan, from rashly initiating hostilities. Second, it must strengthen its military power as the ultimate weapon to subdue the hypothetical enemy.</p>
<p>Japan has always prided itself on being a maritime kingdom, and its strength should not be underestimated. The United States knows this very well. The most superior shipbuilding proposal passed this time is not only sufficient to seek partial remedies for the domestic industrial sector but also enough to trigger Japan's pursuit and competition, leading it to economic suicide due to excessive military expansion.</p>
<p>However, we must observe the current strength of the U.S. Navy. It is not surprising that the country's leaders are uneasy. Some say that even if the United States moves its entire Atlantic fleet to its forward base in the Pacific—Pearl Harbor—it can only勉力(mianli) maintain the security of the Pacific coast. It is doubtful whether it can absolutely maintain the Panama Canal. The U.S. light cruisers are not as advanced as Japan's new ones, and many of the destroyers are old. The submarine strength is also weak and insufficient to win. In this situation, it is impossible to restrain the activities of the Japanese navy in the Pacific, and it is also a fantasy to restrict the Japanese navy from controlling the power in the Far East. Once war breaks out, the U.S. naval bases in the Far East, such as the Philippines, and the military strongholds, such as Guam, will be ravaged by the Japanese army. Even the Aleutian Islands, which can serve as the vanguard of the U.S. Air Force, will inevitably be attacked and even fall into the hands of the enemy. If the military situation is like this, then how can a certain Far Eastern market not be invaded by others?</p>
<p>Since the United States is aware of the seriousness of the Pacific situation and the danger of its own situation, it has to take the opportunity to consolidate its naval position. Once it has the confidence in its naval strength and is not afraid, it can then further develop the advantages of the air force to control the final victory. If so, then the United States will have the possibility of permanently maintaining its Far Eastern market. Important raw materials can be imported without hindrance, and even the economic struggles that usually carry the smell of military affairs will not be taken advantage of by others.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Disagreement on Silver Proposal Creates Tense Situation in U.S. Congress <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>No Concrete Action Expected Today</p>
<p>President and Treasury Secretary Offer No Specific Opinions</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the common opinion of reporters visiting various members of the House of Representatives, the legislative action regarding silver in this session will depend on the resolution of the House leaders, who will only listen to the instructions of the executive branch. The situation in Congress is becoming increasingly tense today because the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures has recommended that the report on reconciling the Fox bill and the Strong bill, discussed in Congress on Saturday and Sunday, be handed over to the House Rules Committee for drafting. According to the Associated Press, Representative Scrugham, a leader of the House silver bill, stated that the President will decide what action Congress will take on silver. Representative Scrugham stated that since the relationship between silver and all currencies is so close, this problem can only be solved by incorporating silver into the ordinary currency plan. President Roosevelt and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau have no specific opinions on the silver issue. Therefore, experts believe that the House of Representatives' vote on reconciling the Fox plan and the Taiwanese proposal on Saturday and Sunday is unlikely to result in concrete action. Various factions in Congress have different opinions on the procedure for the silver proposal. The silver purchase bill of Congressman Goldsborough has now been amended, and Mr. Goldsborough has also expressed his agreement. This bill suggests purchasing silver from 50 million to 100 million ounces per month. When silver is 371.22 grams equal to 23.22 grams of gold, then silver purchase should be stopped. It is also learned that the House Rules Committee has not discussed the silver proposal but is prepared to give notarized approval to the plan authorized by the executive branch. Representative Mabee stated that because he lacks reports on the silver issue, he thinks it is best not to overreact to this proposal. It is generally believed that if the executive branch has no intention of acting on the silver proposal, it will use the excuse of preventing the President from issuing an executive order to replace silver purchase with seigniorage to assist the silver problem.

The Minister of the Navy will be able to build oil stations and coastal defenses with £1,560,000. £11,625,000 will be allocated to the Aviation Department to improve the Air Force based on the principle of quality over quantity, and a first-line aviation team will be reorganized to respond to any emergencies at any time. (Reuters Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) In order for the Army, Navy, and Air Force to implement military organizations or reform military affairs, the government has submitted a draft law proposing (1) to establish special accounting for the Army, Navy, and Air Force, which will be included in the special items of the national treasury; (2) to allow the Army, Navy, and Air Force to spend the following expenses, namely (A) The Ministry of the Army will spend 1,175,000,000 francs in the 1934-1935 budget to complete the northern border defense project; (B) The Ministry of the Navy will spend 825,000,000 francs in the 1934-1935 budget to build liquid fuel storage tanks, deploy coastal defense projects, and enrich aviation, so that it can cooperate with the Navy; (C) The Aviation Department will spend 980,000,000 francs in the 1934 budget to consolidate the Air Force's armaments and various equipment.

The Home Fleet, with thirty-one ships, led by Admiral Kelly, will attack the Strait of Gibraltar, which is defended by the Mediterranean Fleet, from Lagos, a port south of Portugal. The Mediterranean Fleet is commanded by Fisher, and its strength is far below that of the Home Fleet, but the former should prevent the latter from crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and, if necessary, sink its ships. This exercise is scheduled to begin on March 11th. Judging from the location of the exercise, the number of ships participating, and the speed of the fleet, it can be seen that the nature of this exercise is extremely important.

<p>(London) It is learned here that the German newspapers are very pleased with the speech of the Belgian Prime Minister Broqueville in the parliament, supporting the principle of German arms equality, especially his discussion of the mistakes of 1919, and his view that it is almost impossible to keep a great power in a state of disarmament forever. However, opinions here on Broqueville's speech are exactly the opposite, and it is considered to be very unfavorable to the British disarmament plan. Many people here believe that the British plan is completely ineffective because Germany's request to build a thousand aircraft has dealt it a major blow. Moreover, the French side also opposes the British plan if it cannot be effectively changed and does not guarantee against German aggression. Currently, pro-French public opinion is growing here, because in fact, Germany's military preparations far exceed the limits of the Treaty of Versailles. However, according to the opinion of wise observers, the domestic situation in Germany is an important factor in the issue of German disarmament or military expansion. The National Socialist government has apparently not yet restored Germany's prosperity, and the unemployment problem is particularly serious. Therefore, it is said that Germany's poverty is the only effective guarantee of peace. (Translated by Wa Lun Agency, Zilin West Report, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Lord Privy Seal Baldwin declared in the House of Commons the other day that if a general disarmament treaty cannot be achieved, the British government should begin negotiations to establish an air force agreement in Western Europe. Yesterday morning, some political figures believed that it was only Baldwin's personal opinion, but others said that it represented the opinion of the entire cabinet. As for the cabinet members, Foreign Secretary Simon, Minister of Public Works Ormsby-Gore, and Attorney General Jowitt all said that Baldwin's statement in the House of Commons the other day, that when all else fails, a smaller-scale air force agreement should be concluded by the countries of Western Europe, truly represents the opinion of the entire cabinet. It is also rumored that the government is drafting a comprehensive plan to reorganize British national defense, which will cost tens of thousands of pounds, and is preparing to submit it for discussion when Congress convenes this autumn. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain denied this rumor from Birmingham. To sum up, before deciding to reorganize its military, the British cabinet still intends to make renewed efforts on the disarmament issue, which is a realistic situation. (Havas Telegram, 10th)</p>

However, after the Habsburg restoration in the future, there may be extremely serious disputes in European international relations, or even a war. Benes also predicted that when the Habsburgs re-enter Vienna in the future, it will be the day when the three countries of the Czech Republic, Yugoslavia, and Romania recall their ambassadors. Benes also said that the Little Entente countries will do their best to oppose the restoration of the Habsburg family, because no matter what kind of incident may be tolerated, the entry of the ruling Austrian-Hungarian royal family into Austria is tantamount to the repeated start of secret collusion, and its goal is naturally to revise the current treaty. Therefore, the Czech Republic is willing to do its utmost to prevent this development. From Benes's unspoken meaning, it seems that the Little Entente countries are willing to resort to force on this matter. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>

As for myself and many other members of the former Austrian royal family, we have joined the Patriotic League since mid-February, but I have not joined any royalist orthodox faction.

<p>The Athens government had previously promised the parliament to issue a declaration to explain Greece's obligations under the Balkan Entente Pact. However, the opposition and the ruling parties had not reached an agreement on this explanation. All parties may have deemed it hopeless, but yesterday evening, through the mediation of former Prime Minister Alexandros Papanastasiou, the two sides reached an agreement. After unanimous consultation, the government will issue a declaration that uses language that satisfies all political parties. The original text of this declaration has not been notified to the newspapers and will be reserved for on-site publication in the parliament. However, according to general knowledge, this declaration does not violate the spirit and letter of the Balkan Entente Pact, but explains the spirit of each purpose of the pact and the obligations Greece has under the pact. Therefore, some newspapers that have opposed the Balkan Entente Pact in the past have stopped attacking the pact this morning. The newspapers have expressed satisfaction with the government and the opposition reaching a consensus and hope that the government and the opposition can remain consistent. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>Reduced by More Than Three Million People</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since German Chancellor Hitler came to power, he has been working hard to solve the unemployment problem. According to the news released by the government, the number of unemployed people in Germany has now been reduced to the lowest level since 1921. It also stated that the number of unemployed people in February of this year suddenly decreased by 400,000, so the total number of unemployed people has now been reduced to 3.37 million, which is 341,000 lower than the lowest number in the year when Mr. Hitler first joined the government. Based on the above published figures, it can be seen that the rebound in unemployment this winter has not only been offset, but is also very optimistic about the future of this year. Perhaps this year, as a result of the government's efforts, unemployment in Germany can be swept away. Furthermore, the current number of unemployed people has decreased by more than 2.63 million compared with the same month last year, and the most important progress is due to the encouragement of construction projects and the widespread upward development of German industry.

<p>Producing 10.3 Million Bales of Cotton</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government plans to reduce the amount of cotton produced from 1934 to 1935 and has now been able to reduce it to 10 million bales in accordance with the regulations of the London Cotton Association last year. According to personnel from the Cotton Group of the Agricultural Improvement Administration, 15 million mu of cotton fields have been reduced by legal means, so there are only 25 million mu to 27 million mu of land that can be planted this year. It is estimated that the total amount of cotton produced will not exceed 10.3 million bales. The recent proposal by Minkheim will also be implemented, and a tax of 1.2 cents per pound will be added to those outside the 1,000-bale production volume. (National News Agency, 9th)</p>

<p>Discussing the World Market in Five Regions</p>
<p>(London) The United Kingdom is now seriously trying to break the existing deadlock in the Anglo-Japanese textile industry negotiations. On Thursday, representatives of Lancashire sent a statement to the Japanese representatives containing the final proposal to achieve this goal, advocating dividing the world market into five regions, namely (1) the British Empire, (2) Australia, (3) the Japanese Empire, (4) South America, (5) other countries. Therefore, the United Kingdom and its colonies can be regarded as one region for discussion, which is carried out in parallel with discussions in other regions. The special committee studying Japanese competition has today approved the actions of the British representatives, and the meeting will resume on March 14. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Osaka, the Japan Spinners' Association received a memorandum from the British representatives and a telegram regarding the policy of requesting a sixth consultation from the delegation stationed in the United Kingdom on the 9th. The members of the association held a secret meeting at 2:00 p.m. to consult. As a result, it was decided to hold a special committee for Anglo-Japanese consultation on the 10th or 12th to discuss the contents of the British memorandum. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The state of trade between countries is quite cold due to the world's depression. British trade is no exception to this, but only Japanese goods are developing in the world market. Japan should take the same steps as other countries to implement the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity in practice. For this purpose, Japan needs to implement appropriate measures to control its exports.</p>
<p>2.  The United Kingdom advocates that Britain and Japan discuss the world market issue.</p>
<p>3.  The agreed year should be 1931, when world trade was maintained at a normal state, as the standard.</p>
<p>4.  Britain and Japan shall agree on the export ratio of each country according to the ratio principle.</p>
<p>Because the British memorandum has no concessions in substance, the Japanese side believes that there is no room for consideration and has decided to adopt the established policy. (United Press, 10th)</p>

<p>Never Conspired to Rebel</p>
<p>(Paris) Former Prime Minister Daladier told the Stavisky case investigation committee today that former Interior Minister Frot never had the problem of conspiring to rebel. Former Police Chief Chiappe once told him that Frot intended to form his own cabinet, but this was a legitimate attempt and nothing more. He had never heard of Chiappe and Frot taking any action beyond the political or parliamentary sphere. He did not see any evidence of Chiappe's malpractice in the Stavisky documents, but he felt that Chiappe, as police chief, was too inactive, because he should have approved the arrest of Stavisky in 1931 or at the latest in 1932. Therefore, he decided to replace the police chief. As for Chiappe's claim that someone asked a wealthy cabinet member to provide money so that the Red Army could purchase weapons, he could not remember whether Chiappe had told him about it.

<p>Donating Funds to Promote Peace Work</p>
<p>A Wealthy American Woman Donates a Huge Amount of Property</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Associated Press learned that a wealthy woman from Philadelphia, USA, today designated the League of Nations as the heir to her huge amount of property. This is the first time that the League of Nations has accepted private property. This woman is still alive, so the League of Nations refused to announce her surname, but it is said that the total amount of property is very large. The will states that after the woman's death, this property will first be managed by her husband, and after his death, it will be handed over to her sister, and finally to the League of Nations. Before accepting the title of heir, the League of Nations sought legal advice on the matter. According to experts, the League of Nations' financial regulations do not prohibit the League of Nations from accepting property given by a will. The League of Nations authorities stated that accepting the American woman's gift may lead to greater donations. In the future, the League of Nations will have extensive industries in various parts of the world, and the League of Nations' technical and social work will be further developed due to sufficient inheritance. In the past, the League of Nations' political work was funded by its member states. American people have been enthusiastic about public welfare and have funded the League of Nations' technical and scientific research work. The Rockefeller Foundation donated US$66,000,000, in addition to building a League of Nations building worth US$5,000,000, and built a League of Nations library. The League of Nations' health work has also benefited greatly from the Rockefeller Foundation. In short, most of the League of Nations' social welfare work is funded by the Hague Foundation. Rockefeller also donated US$100,000 to the League of Nations to study methods to prevent commercial and private income from paying heavy taxes. Regarding this point, an international draft has been submitted to various governments. The Wilson Foundation also donated 25,000 yuan to build a bronze gate for the League of Nations Assembly Hall. The League of Nations Assembly Hall is the largest in the world and is expected to be completed next year. In addition, there are many donations from American public groups, including a donation of 10,000 yuan from an anonymous person to fund research on reforming the calendar. Another group calling itself American citizens donated US$10,000 for disaster relief in Albania. Donations to the League of Nations around the world are increasing year by year, ranging from a few pennies to several yuan. Children in British primary schools often save their candy money to fund the League of Nations' peace work. The League of Nations has to take simple acceptance procedures for this kind of small donation. In the past, all donations had to be approved by the League of Nations Administrative Council, but now the Secretary-General of the League of Nations is authorized to accept gifts of less than 5,000 Swiss francs that comply with the League of Nations' financial regulations.

The opinions of both parties are still approaching. The amount of reduction is about 10 million to 20 million. However, our country had a bumper harvest of cotton and wheat last year and does not need to rely on foreign countries to avoid a sharp drop in prices and affect the rural economy. Moreover, this year's new wheat will soon be on the market, and it is expected that this year's wheat will also be enough. Therefore, it is planned to reduce the amount of wheat in the loan as much as possible, followed by cotton, and change the purchase of items needed by our country. A plan to purchase items has been developed and telegraphed to Wei Wenbin to consult with the US authorities. What the result will be is still difficult to predict. It is expected to be decided soon.

Two independent divisions have been added in eastern Hubei, and one independent division has been formed on the Hunan-Hubei border, but each only has the strength of one regiment, making their actual power extremely weak.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to a certain Jiehou, Park Ui-yeol's release was entirely due to the French Consul General upholding justice based on legal principles. Because the Japanese Consul did not obtain the French Consul's consent, he forcibly detained Park in the French Concession, which constituted an illegal act. After releasing Park, the French Consul General only then notified both China and Japan, without contacting either party beforehand, demonstrating his impartiality. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Recent Activities of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Wang Delin and Kong Xianwu Retreat to the Jilin Border</p>
<p>Chen Dongshan Advances to the Vicinity of Mishan</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army has recently, due to Pu Yi's usurpation and proclamation as emperor, willingly subjecting himself to enemy control, risen up spontaneously and issued denunciations. Although their advances and retreats cannot fully follow planned implementations, they have given the enemy and traitors a considerable shock. Among the armies that are most active are Chen Dongshan and Gao Yushan in the Hulin-Raohe area; Wang Delin and Kong Xianwu in the Dongning-Ning'an area; Li Jiujiang on the Haisui Railway line; Zhang Yuting on the Harbin-Manzhouli line; and Zhang Kuiwu on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line. Among them, Wang Delin, Kong Xianwu, and their units, due to the combined advances of the Japanese 10th Division Regiment, the Hirose Unit, the pseudo-Jilin 7th Brigade, Bai Wenqing, and the pseudo-mountainous guerilla force led by Zhang Zikai, retreated to the Chinese-Russian border at Sanchakou for temporary refuge. Wang Delin and a portion of his troops moved to the activities along the TianTu line. On the 27th of last month, in response to a secret agreement with Chen Dongshan's Volunteer Army in Hulin, they advanced to Dongjingcheng to contain the Japanese army and echoed Chen's Volunteer Army. Later, due to a lack of ammunition, they retreated in two parts to various places along the border. Currently, they are contacting Korean patriots from Yanji, Hunchun, and Wangqing Counties, taking a liaison formation, allowing for rest and reorganization before carrying out further activities. Li Jiujiang's unit still has more than 5,000 men, appearing and disappearing between Hailun, Suihua, Qinggang, and Anda Counties, and maintaining contact with Zhang Kuiwu's unit in Zhaodong. One attacks while the other advances, so that the Japanese and puppet troops cannot take care of both ends. Zhang Kuiwu was Ma Zhanshan's bodyguard captain, from greenwoods origins. He leads more than 2,000 men, and is very active in Zhaodong, Dalian, Jiangqiao, Daxing and other places. A month ago, the Japanese army, together with the puppet Wang Shudong army, besieged them. After a day of fierce fighting, Zhang was able to lead his troops to break through the encirclement and retreat to Jingsheng to reorganize. Recently, he has replenished his army, but he feels the lack of ammunition, and it is not easy to advance for a while. Zhang Yuting's unit was the brave general of Su Bingwen's unit in the Harbin-Manzhouli line battle. At Fularji, with a brigade of troops, he resisted the Japanese army for a month. Although the soldiers' hands and feet were cracked by frostbite, they were still able to follow orders and kill the enemy. After Su Bingwen retreated to Russia, Zhang led his troops to continue to resist the Japanese. For two months, the derailment of the train at the Xiaohaizi station on the Harbin-Manzhouli line, and the overturning of the Japanese soldiers' car at the Nianzishan station, were all done by Zhang's army. At the end of last month, due to the Japanese 14th Division regiment, the Hata Unit, and the pseudo-Heilongjiang army Feng Guangyou Unit attacking in concert, the numerical advantage was in the enemy's favour, and the damage was slightly significant. They have retreated to the vicinity of Nenjiang for replenishment, and it will be difficult to have effective activities within a short time. Chen Dongshan and Gao Yushan's two units, with approximately 20,000 men, are led by Chen as the commander-in-chief and Gao as the deputy commander, relying on the Russian border and the dangerous mountains of Hulin to fight against the enemy. They have fought for several years, and the Japanese and puppet armies can do nothing about it. On the 28th of last month, Chen Dongshan personally led 6,000 men to attack Hulin County City. The garrison in the city included a regiment of the 4th Cavalry Detachment of the pseudo-Jilin Army, a large detachment of the Japanese Army, and the pseudo-Army, all of whom were commanded by the Japanese. After a day and night of fierce fighting, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were annihilated, and one battalion of the pseudo-Army was annihilated. The Japanese commander, Mogi, was injured in more than a dozen places, his leg was broken and he was unable to walk. Fearing being captured by the Volunteer Army, he committed suicide by disembowelment. Many Japanese and puppet soldiers who failed to escape were captured by the Volunteer Army. A lot of guns and bullets were also seized. This was the only major victory for the Volunteer Army in several months. Chen's army has now passed Heizuizi and is advancing towards Mishan. Only because the food for the people in the Hulin-Raohe area is lacking, and the Volunteer Army's supplies are insufficient, and clothing is also lacking, so activities cannot be carried out as desired. Chen Dongshan was a commander under Li Du. During the Sino-Russian conflict, he participated in the Battle of Sanjiangkou. After the September 18th Incident, when Li Du's army entered Harbin, Chen's unit was expanded into a brigade. Later, he followed Li Du to fight in various places along the Jilin border. After Li returned to China, a part of his army was commanded by Chen, and expanded its strength, and worked with Gao Yushan to resist the Japanese. He remained unyielding and was always considered by the Japanese army to be a strong enemy. At the moment, the Japanese army plans to transfer the Nakamura regiment of the 10th Division regiment, to contact the 4th Detachment of the pseudo-Jilin Army, and Yu Chen 部, the pseudo-Garrison Commander of the Yilan area, to attack together, in an attempt to eliminate them, but it has not yet been mobilized.

<h3 id="e98">Chairman Chiang on Propriety, Music, and Time <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Central Guidelines of the New Life Movement</p>
<p>Words of Instruction from the Memorial Week at the Generalissimo's Headquarters</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The Generalissimo's Headquarters held an expanded memorial week on the 5th. Chairman Chiang attended and gave instructions, titled "The New Life Movement Should Pay Attention to Propriety, Music, and Time." The original words have been organized as follows:</p>
<p>Recently, the entire society of Nanchang has been improving day by day, and the soldiers fighting bandits at the front have also been improving day by day. This is a good phenomenon since the launch of the New Life Movement. Today, I want to talk to you about the most important things that the New Life Movement should pay attention to. Last time, I talked about the essence of the New Life Movement, and I have already said that the New Life Movement is to make all our lives conform to the principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Because whether it is a country, a society, an organization, a family, or even every individual, to develop upward and to succeed in any undertaking, big or small, they must be based on the spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Therefore, not only the life of the entire nation and the major affairs of the country must be based on propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, but also personal private life cannot be separated from propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. This is the central guideline of our New Life Movement. Now let us ask which of these four virtues is the most important. We can know by looking at the order in which these four characters are arranged.</p>
<p>The most important thing is "propriety." Looking back at the subjects taught in China in the past, namely propriety, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and arithmetic, the six arts, "propriety" was also the first. Since "propriety" is the most important of the four dimensions and the six arts, if we want to create a civilized, progressive, secure, and developing country, society, family, or organization, we must first have "propriety." Whether it is the army, students, children, or citizens, if they do not pay attention to propriety, then everything is useless. If those of us who have the responsibility of teaching understand this principle, then there is no one who cannot be taught well. If those who receive instruction understand this principle, then no matter what knowledge they can learn well, and no matter what things they can accomplish. The general problem now is that people do not know the importance of "propriety," so whether it is schools, armies, or society, none of them can become a cohesive whole. If things continue like this, how can we achieve great success, establish great undertakings, complete the revolution, and realize the principles of the Premier?</p>
<p>Everyone must understand, what is the fundamental difference between humans and animals? Many animals can also speak and have various special skills and keen senses. As for diet and living, there is no need to say more, there is no fundamental difference between them and humans. Then, where is the fundamental difference between humans and animals? It lies in whether or not they know propriety. Since humans are human because they know propriety, then if a person does not know propriety, does not value propriety, and does not practice propriety, then he cannot be called a person, and is the same as an animal. Therefore, since our parents gave birth to us to be a person, we must learn propriety, know propriety, and practice propriety in order to live up to our birth and not be ashamed of being a person. Everyone should know that the first book written by the Premier in his life was "Fundamentals of National Rights," which discussed the organization of social groups and the rules of meetings, all of which are basic rules for group activities or public life. The Premier talked about the Three Principles of the People for decades, why did he not write a book on the Three Principles of the People first, but instead wrote "Fundamentals of National Rights" first? It was because he saw that the Chinese people did not understand the order of group life and did not understand etiquette, so he first wrote this "Fundamentals of National Rights" to teach the general public the basics of all etiquette in society. "Fundamentals of National Rights" contains all the spirit of "propriety" and is truly the most perfect and practical practice of "propriety." If people do not even know "Fundamentals of National Rights," then all group activities will be without etiquette and law, and no social group organization can succeed, not to mention the country. Therefore, if we want to realize the Doctrine, complete the revolution, and establish a free and equal country, we must first have a foundation for social construction, that is, we must be familiar with and do "Fundamentals of National Rights" and be able to value propriety, learn propriety, and practice propriety. If every Chinese person can know "Fundamentals of National Rights" and understand the spirit of "Fundamentals of National Rights" and apply it to general affairs, I believe that the revolution would have been completed long ago and the country would have been built long ago.</p>
<p>Why were Turkey, Italy, and Germany able to quickly complete the revolution and build new countries, while our revolution has failed to this day? The most fundamental reason is that no national citizen does not respect social order, strictly abide by group discipline, and extend this to loyalty to the country and the nation, fulfilling the responsibilities of a citizen, and everything can conform to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Therefore, not only will their domestic enemies naturally surrender, but also all foreigners will be awed by this situation. The New Life Movement that we are now promoting is a basic revolutionary movement to build the country and revive the nation. All comrades who participate in this movement, especially leaders from all sectors of the party, government, military, academia, and police, should understand that "propriety" is the most central and urgent thing in the New Life Movement. Whether it is during meetings or speeches, they must always teach them to value propriety, know propriety, and practice propriety at all times. For example, when attending a meeting, one should know how to perform the three bows. Whenever and wherever one hears the national anthem or sees the national flag being raised or lowered, one should show respect. These are the courtesies that the general public must understand, and we must pay special attention to teaching the general public.</p>
<p>There is another point that everyone should know, that is, so-called "propriety" must have moderation. Without moderation, it cannot be called propriety. What is moderation? It is the most reasonable rule and degree. Without rules and moderation, it is chaos and cannot be called "propriety." Therefore, propriety and moderation are inseparable. The meaning of "moderation" is in propriety, and the expression of propriety is in moderation. If there is propriety without moderation, it is the same as without propriety. For example, now a subordinate in the army salutes his superior, but he puts his hand down before the person receiving the salute has finished returning the salute. This is without moderation, not propriety. It cannot be called a subordinate saluting his superior, it can only be considered a superior saluting his subordinate. Is there still propriety in this? It must be known that the person saluting must wait until the person receiving the salute sees you and finishes returning the salute before respectfully putting down his hand. Have you taught these things to your subordinates or students? Not only have you not taught them, but even after I have said it several times, you still do not know how to do it. Therefore, it can be seen how difficult it is to know propriety. Not to mention that the general public in society cannot understand propriety, even this leading organization of the Generalissimo's Headquarters still has things that have not been done well. For example, the master of ceremonies today is not correct. He only knows propriety but does not know moderation. When everyone is bowing and has not yet stood up, he calls for the second bow. When the second bow has not yet been completed, he calls for the third bow. This is without moderation and cannot be called propriety.</p>
<p>Also, the commands shouted in ordinary units are the same. Often, after the first command, for example, "attention," is shouted, he does not see if the people receiving the command have all stood at attention, and then immediately issues the second command, "left face" or "right face." This is also without moderation. It is not known that after we issue a command, we must use both eyes to see all the people receiving the command, and we must wait until each and every one of them has done well according to the first command before we can issue the second command. In this way, the actions can be real and the moderation can be unhurried, and this can be considered propriety. Teaching subordinates or students in this way can be effective. Foreign education is like this, everything is down-to-earth, follows the rules, and comes step by step.</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>Everything is done one by one. The reason why the Chinese army cannot be trained well and has no spirit is because the person teaching only shouts commands and does not pay attention to the person receiving the command, that is, the mouth arrives but the eyes do not. The reason why foreign armies are trained well and have spirit is because their training is real in everything. After a command is shouted, no matter how many thousands or hundreds of subordinates there are, they must see that</p>
<p>everyone has done well before issuing the second command. These words are saying that propriety must have moderation, and we must perform propriety with moderation.</p>
<p>Precisely because propriety must have moderation, propriety and music have an inseparable relationship. What is music? Music is moderation. Only when the moderation is harmonious can it become musical and beautiful, and the rhythm of music and the moderation of ceremonies are really the same thing in terms of meaning and function. Therefore, if we want to know propriety, we must know music. How is our music now? For example, when our Chinese ships pass by places where foreign ships are docked, they play our national music, which is so solemn and majestic and surpasses the general military music of our country. Take the military music of the Generalissimo's Headquarters and compare it with the military music of the National Government or the Military Academy in Nanjing. Playing the party song is the same tune, and the same copper drums and horns are used, but the sound that is blown is much different. What is the reason for this? It is because the people who are blowing only care about blowing and think that it is done, and do not study how to blow it more harmoniously, solemnly, and majestically. In the future, we must pay attention to studying and improving it.</p>
<p>This is talking about the people who play music.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the people who sing. Originally, when we sing, on one</p>
<p>hand, we must watch the gestures of the music team, and on the other hand, we must look at the music, and sing along with the gestures and the music, so that the whole field can be consistent and the rhythm can be accurate. However, when the general Chinese sing, the musicians only care about blowing there, and the singers sing separately here. As a result, they do not care whether the singing is neat or not, and whether the pitch and rhythm are correct. How can this be called music? These are just two extremely crude and superficial things to illustrate that the Chinese do not value music, and therefore cannot know propriety through knowing music, and cannot value music through valuing propriety.</p>
<p>From now on, those of us who are doing the New Life Movement must think of various methods and teach the general public at all times, so that they pay attention to both propriety and music at the same time. The New Life Movement that we are doing, in terms of its method and content, is completely a kind of social education. The purpose is to enable everyone in society to understand propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, to be responsible, to abide by discipline, and to be able to learn the six arts of propriety, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and arithmetic, especially the two most important things, "propriety" and "music." These four dimensions and six arts are the virtues and intelligence that a person must possess. To be a complete and noble citizen, one must have everything.</p>
<p>Now the general Chinese people think that everything is very good about themselves, and that foreigners are deliberately oppressing us. I think this view is wrong in many ways. It must be known that things must rot first before insects are born, people must insult themselves first before others insult them, and the country must attack itself first before others attack it. It is not known that many things are because we Chinese are too uncompetitive. The virtues and intelligence of the general public are inferior to others. In being a person, especially in being a modern citizen, the various conditions are not as complete as others, that is, they cannot be equal to others. Now we want to promote the New Life, which is to enable the general public to know this principle, realize themselves, be ambitious, and take propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame as the highest criterion, starting from their own daily life, clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and strive to improve their entire lives, and increase the virtue and intelligence of their lives. Not only must they be able to have a personality that is completely equal to the citizens of modern countries, but also they must be able to promote the inherent virtues of our nation, and be able to surpass the citizens of any modern country. Only in this way can they be worthy of being citizens of the Republic of China and filial sons of their parents, and only in this way can they be worthy of being followers of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point that we should pay special attention to when promoting the New Life Movement and teach the general public in society by setting an example, that is, to cherish time. The first important thing is to be punctual. Originally, everything in the universe and life is in the longitudinal and horizontal coordination of evolution, time, and space. However, in terms of the constancy of space and the brevity of life, time is like a fleeting moment, difficult to obtain and easy to lose, and it is indeed the mother of all our careers and lives. For example, in terms of war, I have often said that fighting is fighting for time. Whoever can cherish time and be faster than the enemy in everything can win the final victory. The key to success or failure and life or death is entirely in time. From human life to all life phenomena, they are all based on the keynote of "struggle for survival" and are contained in the vast war, and time determines their life, death, success, or failure. From this point, we can even more clearly see the preciousness of time.</p>
<p>Now the general Chinese people do not know this most important principle, so they do not know how to cherish time and cannot be punctual in everything. As a result, everyone wastes their precious lives, and the entire society and country</p>
<p>and the nation will not be able to make progress or be built up well. Therefore, our nation is regarded as barbaric and backward and is wantonly invaded. Now we are promoting the New Life Movement, and we must enable the general public to understand the preciousness of time, and everyone can strive to be timely and punctual. From the personal daily life to the activities of most people's social groups, they must strictly abide by time and do a certain job. In this way, time will not be wasted and things can be done well. For example, if we have a place and set a time to arrive, we must arrive at that time. These good habits completely depend on those of us who promote the New Life Movement, especially leaders from all sectors of the party, government, military, and police, to be able to set an example and do what they say, and then supervise their subordinates or students to do it, and then teach the general public in society to do it. I have heard that there are very few responsible leaders in the Generalissimo's Headquarters who cannot strictly supervise their subordinates. Every day when they come to work, they let them casually sign in or leave after they arrive. If this is the case, then how can they succeed? How can a military organization be called the highest headquarters? Therefore, I hope that all comrades in the Generalissimo's Headquarters can pay attention to this point, and with the meaning of "advancing to think of loyalty and retreating to think of making up for the past," "correct it if you have it, and encourage yourself if you don't." We must always be the first to be punctual ourselves, so that we can move the whole of Nanchang, the whole of Jiangxi, and even the whole of China. Therefore, we must encourage each other with this. Whoever can cherish time and be punctual is a revolutionary comrade who can achieve great success and establish great undertakings. Whoever cannot cherish time and be punctual is abandoning himself. No matter how good his skills are, no matter how big or small the undertaking is, he will not succeed. Time is the mother of all undertakings and life. If we want to succeed in all undertakings and realize the highest</p>
<p>meaning and value of life, we must first cherish time, and cherish time must start with being punctual.</p>
<p>Today, we are talking about the principles of propriety, music, and time that we should pay special attention to when promoting the New Life. These principles are what everyone should understand, practice throughout their lives, and benefit from throughout their lives. I hope that everyone will do it when the time comes, otherwise they will be willing to be inferior people and take the path of failure. If they can do it, they will be worthy of being citizens of a modern civilized country, and everything can be successful." (March 9)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Chiang Ting-wen Returns to Fujian to Deploy Military Affairs <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Two Routes of Central Army Advance Towards Northern Fujian</p>
<p>Military Liaison Between Fujian and Guangdong Has Been Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: After Chiang Ting-wen met with Chen Jitang, a concrete plan has been agreed upon regarding the joint suppression of Jiangxi bandits. Therefore, he left Guangzhou on the 3rd at noon and returned to Fujian. At 4:30 PM, he returned to Xiamen. The next day, he went to Zhangzhou to establish the Eastern Route Army Bandit Suppression Headquarters. The Central Army in Fujian was divided into two routes to advance towards northern Fujian. Wei Lihuang was formed into two columns to cooperate with Gu Zhutong and Chen Cheng's two units on the Jiangxi border. Liu Heding was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Ninth Column, concurrently in charge of Lu Xingbang, Zhou Zhiqun, and Zhang Luanji's three divisions. Tang Enbo was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Tenth Column, concurrently in charge of Leng Xin, Fan Songfu, and Sun Yuanliang's three divisions. Liu was in charge of the right wing, and Tang was in charge of the left wing. The left-wing army crossed Shunchang from Yanping on the 25th of last month and attacked the bandits from Jiangle. The right-wing army captured Sha County on the same day. The bandits retreated towards Yong'an, Qingliu, Guihua, and Ninghua. The bandits entrenched in Qingliu and Liancheng, seeing the arrival of the Central Army, have retreated towards Guangchang and Shicheng on the Jiangxi border. Li Yutang, Li Yannian, Li Mo'an, Song Xilian, Chen Mingren, Liu Kan, Wang Jingjiu, Chen Qixuan, and other divisions were led by Zhuang Dingwen and divided into two columns to advance towards western Fujian. The first step was to reach Longyan. It is expected that the Fujian bandits can be suppressed before the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>After the remnant bandits in Sha County and Yong'an fled, there are still scattered bandits in Luokeng, Gaoqiao North Township. Lu Xingbang and Leng Xin's two divisions are now converging to suppress them. A main force of the bandits is guarding Jiangle and stubbornly resisting Liu Heding, Zhou Zhiqun, and other units. Gui Zhenyuan and Jiang Yan's two brigades are advancing towards Zhengfang and Zengfang and are required to capture Jiangle within a time limit. Tang Enbo was ordered to attack Jianning and Taining to cut off the bandits' escape route to Jiangxi. Song Xilian, Chen Mingren, Wang Jingjiu, and other divisions have arrived in Yong'an to search and suppress the bandits in Gongchuan, Sanyuan, Xikou, and Shaxi. If they can be suppressed, the remnants of Luo Binghui and Zhang Dingcheng in Tinglian will retreat without a fight. Chen Cheng, the commander-in-chief of the First Column stationed in Nanfeng and Lichuan, and Wu Qiwu, Xue Yue, and other armies are now taking advantage of the defeat of the Fujian bandits and their retreat into Jiangxi and have set off for Luofang to intercept the bandits in Guangchang.</p>
<p>The day after Chiang left Guangdong, Chen Jitang convened another meeting of generals in Meihua Village to discuss military affairs of bandit suppression. Those who attended the meeting were Yu Hanmou, Zhang Da, Miao Peinan, Huang Guanzhang, Du Yiqian, Huang Guangrui, Zhang Zhiying, Jiang Xiyuan, and more than a dozen senior officers. It was heard that what was discussed on that day was mostly military liaison between Fujian and Guangdong, and matters such as supply and transportation. Yu Hanmou will return to Dagengling in the near future to direct military affairs. The headquarters also telegraphed Wu Wenjian, the air force stationed in Meixian, to send planes to Changting and Liancheng every day to scout for bandit tracks.</p>
<p>The Guangdong army previously built deep ditches and high walls on the Jiangxi border, and the defense works were extremely strict. It was heard that after the Eastern Route Army of Fujian took over the defense of Longyan, Shanghang, and Yongding, if they launched a general offensive towards Changting, the Guangdong army in Shanghang and Wuping would also attack Huichang Junmenling from Xunwu. At the same time, all armies would jointly encircle and suppress the bandit areas of Ruijin, Yudu, Xingguo, etc., in order to achieve the goal of jointly attacking the Jiangxi bandits. (5th)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Measures for Destroying Counterfeit Currency in Bandit Areas <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Limited Time for Counties to Collect and Destroy</p>
<p>Confiscation Upon Discovery After Deadline</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The General Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits in the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui has recently found that there is a lot of counterfeit currency in the bandit areas. In remote areas, people still hide and collect and privately use them due to their own interests. After inspection by the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau, it was found that the counterfeit silver and copper coins have very low content. According to the currency regulations, the price standard for this counterfeit currency cannot be too high, so as to avoid the possibility of unscrupulous people engaging in private minting for profit, which would be contrary to the original intention of eradicating this evil. Therefore, a request was submitted to Chairman Chiang in Nanchang to formulate measures for collecting and destroying the currency and to issue a general order to all provinces in the bandit suppression area to follow. Chairman Chiang, based on the report, believed that the retention of this counterfeit currency among the people is sufficient to endanger the rural economy and should be strictly cracked down on to prevent hidden dangers. However, the act of collecting and destroying is most likely to cause disturbances. At this time, the coerced have just returned, and there is no time to appease them. If their losses are suddenly increased, it is not enough to pacify the rural areas and show fairness. In order to take care of the people in the bandit areas, the "Measures for Collecting and Destroying Counterfeit Paper and Coin Currency in the Bandit Suppression Area" were specially formulated. All counterfeit paper currency must be collected and destroyed within a time limit. The counterfeit silver and copper coins will be priced and exchanged separately according to the currency regulations and the results of the above-mentioned chemical test, after deducting the cost of melting and loss, to avoid further circulation among the people. The main points of the measures are: ㈠ The provincial governments shall issue a general order to the special commissioner's offices and the county governments to widely announce that within one month, the district public offices shall be responsible for collecting all counterfeit paper currency and submitting it to the county government for public burning. ㈡ The silver and copper content of the counterfeit coins is extremely low. Counterfeit silver dollars will be priced at 60% of the face value, and counterfeit copper coins will be priced at 50% of the face value. Within three months, the county government will advance the funds to exchange them. ㈢ After the expiration of the exchange period, each Bao chief shall issue a pledge stating that there are no counterfeit currencies left in the area and report it to the district branch for verification and then report it to the county government for verification. ㈣ After the exchange of counterfeit coins is completed, the county government shall submit the advanced funds and the number of counterfeit coins exchanged to the financial department for verification and allocation of funds for reimbursement. ㈤ The cost of exchanging counterfeit coins shall be advanced by the provincial treasury. After melting, the silver and copper obtained will be sold to offset the cost. ㈥ After the expiration of the burning and exchange period, if any counterfeit paper or copper coins are found in the counties, they will be confiscated and dealt with according to law. The district Bao and Jia chiefs will also be jointly responsible. The order has been issued to the provincial governments on the 8th to comply with. (8th)</p>

<h3 id="e102">Improvement of Tea and Silk Industries in Anhui Province <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>｜Joint Planning by the Construction and Education Departments｜</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The cooperation plan between the Construction and Education Departments of Anhui Province and the implementation measures, which were previously discussed by the two departments and submitted to the Provincial Government, and then forwarded to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Three Provinces for approval, have now been jointly submitted again to the Provincial Government by the two departments. The report states that tea and silk have always been major export commodities of our country, and Keemun black tea (including Qimen, Zhide, and Fuliang, collectively known as Keemun) is particularly famous worldwide. However, due to adherence to old methods and a lack of improvement, foreigners have rapidly caught up, leading to a sharp decline in sales. The silk industry also suffers from poor quality materials, resulting in sluggish sales abroad. The national economy and people's livelihood are severely affected. At a time when rural areas are bankrupt and all industries are declining, it is imperative to make every effort to improve the inherent natural products of the province, cultivate specialized talents in accordance with local conditions, so that what is learned can be applied, and industry can be revitalized. After repeated consultations between the departments, in accordance with the principle of cooperation between construction and education, it is planned to prepare immediately to add the following two projects starting from the 23rd year of the Republic: ㈠ It is planned to establish a junior vocational school of tea science at the existing Qimen black tea industry improvement farm under the Construction Department. Before starting the school, it is planned to first identify tea science specialists and send them to tea-producing areas such as Japan and India for preliminary investigation, so as to understand the current tea industry production and sales situation in the international market, in order to set improvement standards, start preparations, and, after the school opens, give them important responsibilities and tasks, so that there is no interference and the desired results can be achieved. ㈡ The silk industry in this province has always been centered in the provincial capital. Although the silk production in Qingyang and Guichi is also developed, there is a lack of adequate facilities. It is planned to expand the scale of the existing silk industry improvement farm and the provincial women's vocational school in the provincial capital, based on the previously submitted cooperation plan between the farm and the school, to establish a high and junior level sericulture vocational school, as the center for cultivating sericulture talents in the province. Intensive research and improvement will be conducted on all aspects of mulberry planting, silkworm rearing, seed production, and silk reeling. After graduation, graduates will be assigned to various places to guide the public, thereby opening up sources of profit and revitalizing rural areas. The above facilities will directly improve the province's inherent production, implement the spirit of cooperation between construction and education, and indirectly alleviate the decline of social livelihoods and increase the intangible happiness of the province. It is reported that the Provincial Government has submitted the report for review at the regular meeting. (March 8)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Verdict Announced in Shandong Library Theft Case <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Secretary Si Zhengmin Sentenced to Five Years</p>
<p>Secretary Zhao Sentenced to Six Months</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The case of the theft of a large number of antiques from the Shandong Provincial Library has been transferred to the court for trial. After several court sessions, the thief Si Zhengmin and his wife Si Zhao were interrogated in detail. The inside story and evidence were completely verified. Today (the 8th) at 5 p.m., the Jinan Local Court formally announced the verdict: Si Zhengmin was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, and Si Zhao was sentenced to six months of imprisonment. The court proceedings and the main text of the judgment are recorded below.</p>
<p>Court Proceedings: Today (the 8th) at 4:43 p.m., the bailiffs brought the Si Zhengmin couple from the detention center. Si wore a blue cotton robe, blue socks, and blue cotton trousers, with a felt hat on his head. Si Zhao wore a sheepskin robe. Si was in good spirits, but Zhao looked worried. At 5:00 p.m., Judge Mei Lin and Clerk Zhang Tingwen took the stand to announce the verdict. The judge asked, "Are you Si Zhengmin?" Si replied, "Yes." (Asked) "How old are you?" (Answered) "Thirty-five years old." (Asked) "Where are you from?" (Answered) "Pingyin County." (Asked) "Where do you live in Jinan?" (Answered) "41 Houjie Street, Tongyuan Bureau." After inquiring about Si Zhao's name, age, place of origin, and address, the judge announced the verdict, stating, "This case has now been adjudicated by this court. Si Zhengmin is sentenced to five years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for eight years. Si Zhao is sentenced to six months of imprisonment. The number of days detained before the judgment is finalized will be converted at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. If you do not agree with the judgment, you have ten days to appeal. The appellate body is the High Court." Si Zhengmin declared in court that he did not agree, stating that all the antiques were indeed picked up and not stolen. He said that he could not accept such a judgment. He added that his wife did not help with the transportation and should not be found guilty or have her crime added to his sentence, and requested the judge to release his wife in court. The judge said, "Your denial of theft is incorrect, because it was already past 7:00 p.m. at that time. Thieves cannot steal things, linger, and wait for you to pick them up. Although Si Zhao was unable to assist in the theft, she did transport the stolen goods." Then, the judge read out the main text of the judgment and adjourned the court. The Si Zhengmin couple were returned to custody.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Songjiang Fellow-Provincials Association in Beijing Requests Repair of the Jiangnan Seawall <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>｜Executive Yuan and National Economic Council Have Approved and Are Reviewing｜</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Seawall spans Songjiang, Baoshan, Taicang, and other counties, and is a guarantee for the lives and property of the people in the three prefectures of Suzhou, Songjiang, and Taizhou. It has been in disrepair for many years, and the danger is alarming. Last winter, the Jiangsu Provincial Government submitted a request to the Executive Yuan and the National Economic Council for planning and handling the repairs, which required 1.2 million yuan in construction funds. However, due to the emptiness of the national treasury, it has not been carried out. Millions of people along the coast are increasingly anxious and are running around calling for help. The Songjiang Fellow-Provincials Association in Beijing, including Niu Yongjian, Wang Guangqi, Zhu Shuyuan, Shen Li, and Xia Guangyu, submitted separate requests to the Executive Yuan and the National Economic Council, requesting the allocation of funds and the start of construction as soon as possible. The requests have been approved and are under review. If construction can start soon, it will benefit the national economy and people's livelihood. The original requests and the approval from the Executive Yuan and the National Economic Council are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Songjiang Fellow-Provincials Association in Beijing submitted a petition stating: "Submitting a petition for the Jiangnan Seawall, which urgently needs repairs, urgently requesting the prompt allocation of funds and the start of construction as soon as possible to protect the people's livelihood and benefit the party and the country. Jiangnan has always been known as a prosperous area, and the seawall is the guarantee of prosperity. If the seawall is not repaired, the sea tide will invade, the embankments will collapse, the fertile land will turn into barren salt flats, and the vitality will never recover. The national economy and the people's livelihood are of great importance.</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Seawall in Jiangsu Province spans Songjiang, Baoshan, Taicang, and other counties. Under the old system of the former Qing Dynasty, special commissioners were appointed to manage it, and national funds were used to carry out the work. Repairs were carried out on time, and there were no collapses. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the country has been in chaos, and the financial resources of the state and provinces have been exhausted. The important task of seawall construction has been put on hold. Disasters have repeatedly occurred due to floods,</p>
<p>and the losses have been great. Only patching and repairing have been done, and no fundamental repairs have been made. Over time, the foundation of the seawall has become weak and the body of the seawall has sunk, leading to the great calamity of the twentieth year of the Republic. The seawall was severely damaged again by the typhoons of last autumn, with numerous holes and cracks and a crisis lurking everywhere. If it is not fundamentally repaired, how can safety be ensured in the long term? However, the project is huge and funds are scarce, and it is not easy to start. Those who are planning to deal with the disaster are sitting and talking, but have not taken action. The consequences are worrying, and we tremble to think of them. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, seeing this situation, submitted a request to your association in November of last year to plan and handle the repairs. All the people are stretching their necks and standing on tiptoe, waiting for the implementation of the good policies. However, time has passed and the year has been renewed, but we have not heard any announcements of the plan or the allocation of funds. The people's eager expectations have inevitably turned into disappointment. Your association's overall planning and construction is not limited to seawall construction, but seawall construction is the most urgent task. It seems that the most urgent matters should be addressed first to prevent disasters. This is different from other construction projects, which are of a more moderate nature and can be discussed at leisure. The two should not be treated equally. The cost of repairing the seawall in the four counties of Songjiang, Baoshan, and Taicang is 1.2 million yuan. It was originally planned to raise funds and start construction by the end of last year, otherwise it would be impossible to defend against the autumn floods this year, and the situation would be irreversible. The Jiangsu Provincial Government also stated this emphatically in its previous submission to the Executive Yuan. The matter must be done, and time waits for no one. Millions of lives along the coast are living in a leaky boat in the wind and rain, trembling in fear of the approaching waves, their cries shaking the ground, a tragic scene that is unbearable to hear. The members of the association are deeply concerned about their homeland and cannot ignore the situation. If there is any negligence in the seawall project, not only will the foundation of the social economy be shaken, but the source of the country's finances will also be swept away. What we feel is dangerous, and we cannot remain silent. Therefore, we specially submit this petition, hoping that you will appreciate that the Jiangnan Seawall is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and promptly raise the necessary funds and start construction as soon as possible to eliminate the major disaster and achieve lasting peace. The people of Suzhou will be fortunate, and the party and the country will be fortunate. Respectfully submitted to the National Economic Council." (The text submitted to the Executive Yuan is largely the same, so it is omitted)</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan approved and stated: "The petition has been received. Regarding the case of repairing the Jiangnan Seawall, we previously sent a letter to the National Economic Council to plan and handle the matter, and received a reply stating that the planning documents of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces had been reviewed and handed over to the Water Conservancy Department of the Council for detailed review and handling, and instructed us to investigate and handle the matter. The Executive Yuan ordered the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to be informed. The content of the petition has been communicated to the National Economic Council for verification and handling. Please be informed."</p>
<p>The National Economic Council replied in a letter: "Received your letter stating that the Jiangnan Seawall urgently needs repairs and requesting the prompt allocation of funds for construction. Regarding the case of repairing the Jiangnan Seawall, we previously received a letter from the Executive Yuan forwarding the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments' plans for reorganizing the seawall. The plans have been handed over to the Water Conservancy Department of the Council for review. We have also sent separate letters to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, requesting them to consider the situation and separately formulate detailed plans, and submit them along with various charts for comprehensive planning. We have received your letter and will handle the matter together with the above-mentioned plans and charts. We hereby reply for your information."</p>
<h3 id="e105">Hankou Headquarters to Pilot State-Run Farms <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Proclamation to Clear Public and Private Property Rights</p>
<p>Private Sales are Invalid</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the construction of the sluice gate at Jinkou, over one million mu of lake wasteland in the contiguous area of ​​Wuchang, Xianning, Puchi, and Jiayu counties has been transformed into fertile land. The Headquarters of the Three Provinces for Bandit Suppression, pursuant to the telegram order from Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek from Jiangxi, will pilot large-scale state-run farms in the area, directly managed by the Headquarters. Preparations are now actively underway, and it has been decided to first clear up public and private property rights. All private speculative sales after the construction of the sluice gate will be invalid. On the 7th, the Headquarters issued a proclamation, ordering the Hubei Provincial Government to post it in the four counties, so that everyone knows. The command and proclamation are recorded as follows: ㈠ Headquarters command to the Provincial Government: "Regarding the case of using the lake wasteland emerged after the construction of the Jinkou sluice gate for piloting state-run farms, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau was previously instructed to report on all preparatory matters as soon as possible, and the order was noted on file. However, the public and private property rights in the area are extremely confused, and it is necessary to properly sort them out to avoid encroachment. In addition to the Headquarters formulating measures and assigning personnel to investigate and register the property rights, a proclamation is issued to the Provincial Government, which should be promptly forwarded to the county governments of Jiayu, Puchi, Xianning, and Wuchang counties for posting and notification, and strictly comply with the order." ㈡ "Inquiring that the Jinshui River basin in Hubei Province covers Jiayu, Puchi, Xianning, and Wuchang counties, with an area of ​​over one million mu. For years, it has been subject to the backflow of the Yangtze River, and every spring and summer, it has been flooded, causing disasters and unspeakable harm. The Headquarters has consulted with the National Economic Council to allocate large sums of money to build the Jinkou sluice gate, and has instructed the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to design and construct it. After more than a year of work, it has finally been completed, benefiting the residents along the lake. It has been decided to use the emerged lake wasteland to pilot state-run farms. However, the area, once a swamp, has been transformed into fertile land, which may lead to people coveting it, hoping to occupy it, speculate in purchases, and dispute with false contracts. If preventive measures are not taken in advance, it will inevitably lead to disputes, and the national economy and the people's livelihood will suffer. The disputes over public and private property rights in the area should be resolved after the Headquarters sends personnel to conduct a clear investigation and registration. From the date of the construction of the sluice gate last year, all private speculative sales of Jinshui farmland will be invalid to prevent confusion. In addition to ordering the Hubei Provincial Government to comply with the order, this proclamation is issued to the residents of the area, so that they all comply with it, and shall not privately buy and sell Jinshui farmland, lest they regret it later. Proclaimed by Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek and Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang." (March 7)</p>

<p>In the Wangjiagang area of ​​the eighth district of the county, a boat suddenly passed by late at night the other day. Coincidentally, Chen Rongsheng, the chief of the 17th jia in the eighth district, and Shao Housheng, the deputy chief, led a team to patrol and saw the boat, which looked suspicious. They immediately ordered it to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, the boat was a bandit boat. Three bandits on board jumped into the water and fled. The chief and others chased after them, but because it was dark, they escaped. They only rescued one kidnapped victim and recovered many stolen goods. It is said that his name is Xu Liuying, and he is from the fourth district of Fengxian County. He was kidnapped by more than 30 bandits. However, the kidnapped victim suffered from the cold after entering the water, and his feet were frozen and unable to walk. His family was notified in advance to take him back for treatment. He has now recovered and has been sent to the district for investigation.</p>

<p>Recently, ordinary workers outside the east gate of the county initiated a dragon lantern festival, followed by Youfang Temple and the southeast gate. They paraded in the evening until sunset, with dramas interspersed in the dragon lanterns. Tens of thousands of people watched. The county's Public Security Bureau Chief Hua Shijun, fearing that it would disturb the peace, issued a notice to ban it. However, those people turned a deaf ear. At 8 p.m. on the 9th, the dragon lanterns outside the east gate arrived in front of the county government. Coincidentally, Public Security Bureau Chief Hua Shijun came from the south and stepped forward to dissuade them, which angered the crowd. With a shout of "beat him," he was beaten in the waist. Fortunately, he was clever and escaped to the Yuantai Hotel, where he was out of danger. The crowd, seeing that they had caused trouble, gathered several hundred people and crowded into the Malu Sub-Bureau, demanding an explanation from Patrol Officer Dai Younian. Seeing that Dai was not there, they smashed the guardhouse at the entrance and the wooden sign of the sub-bureau and threw them into the river. They also smashed the door lanterns and screens, leaving nothing intact. The place was in an uproar, and there were thousands of spectators. Later, the Detective Team Leader Wang Yunshan came out to mediate. The crowd demanded to continue the dragon lantern festival for three days, otherwise they would not disperse.

<p>In the fifth district of the county, there is a large grave of the Qian family, which covers a vast area. The family descendants have declined, and there is no one to sweep the tombs during the Cold Food Festival and the Autumn Festival. Therefore, it is generally regarded as an ownerless wasteland tomb. Recently, Mr. Jiang and others from the village initiated a plan to level the Qian family's large tomb and build a ball field for the local youth to exercise and study sports, and it is also planned to set up a station there for passengers on the Wuxi-Jiangyin long-distance buses to get on and off. On the 7th, workers were hired to excavate the tomb. When they dug down six or seven feet, they found a stone tablet, which was extremely solid. When the stone tablet was removed, there was a rotten coffin, which was already in disrepair. The bones in the coffin had also disappeared, with only a large red hat button remaining. Further searching through the soil revealed more than ten gold bars weighing more than ten taels each, and one gold ingot weighing about six or seven taels. In addition, there were countless other Han Dynasty jade items. Among them were two concave-shaped jade pieces, which were likely placed on the hands of the deceased when they were placed in the coffin. The items in the tomb are worth millions. Villagers who heard the news rushed to see it, and the road was blocked. Mr. Jiang and others, fearing that the antiques might be lost, decided to work with local people to jointly decide how to handle them in order to avoid loss.</p>

<p>The housing base area in the county's urban area is estimated to be about 9,000 mu. Since the former Qing Dynasty, the people have not paid</p>

<p>mu will be taxed at four yuan and several jiao. It is estimated that over 300,000 yuan can be collected from the entire city.

<h3 id="e124">The City Chamber of Commerce Requests the Ministry of Finance to Adhere to the Original Country of Origin Marking Implementation Date <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Extension Expires July 1st</p>
<p>Immediate Implementation Without Further Extension</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance, stating:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the request: The "Regulations on Country of Origin Marking for Imported Goods" were formulated and promulgated in February of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933], originally scheduled for implementation on August 1st of the same year. Subsequently, in response to requests from foreign merchants, the implementation was extended to January 1st of the 23rd year [1934]. Merchants looked forward eagerly, believing there would be no further changes at the deadline. Unexpectedly, in November of the previous year, a clear order was received from the government, changing the implementation date to July 1st of this year. This regulation, since its promulgation, has been extended twice consecutively, greatly exceeding merchants' expectations. Marking the country of origin on goods by the country of production is a common practice in modern countries. Last year, various economic conferences of nations passed several measures, the main point being that the implementation of this law should avoid differential treatment for various importing countries. The implementation of this regulation in our country does not involve any differential treatment among nations. Therefore, foreign merchants fundamentally have no grounds for opposition. This is the first point. Originally, Article 1 of the regulations stipulated that the marking should be done in clear Chinese characters. This has been changed to allow marking in the language of the country of origin, which is convenient for foreign merchants and could not be more considerate. There should be no further objections. This is the second point. The purpose of implementing this marking is to prevent producers from using improper competitive means to deceive the public, and to protect legitimate merchants from illegal infringement when selling goods. Therefore, legitimate merchants have no reason not to want the implementation of this regulation. Those with ulterior motives are few in number. The government should uphold international justice and protect the interests of the majority of legitimate merchants, both Chinese and foreign. This is the third point. Based on the above three major reasons, a resolution was passed at the 67th regular meeting of our chamber, requesting the government to implement the aforementioned regulations immediately on July 1st of this year, when the extension expires, without further delay. We hereby submit this case to your ministry for review and approval for implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Sun Ke Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Talks on Silver Agreement Include Conditions</p>
<p>American Loan Affects Economic Commission</p>
<p>Min Rebellion Attempts are Powerless</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 7:20 AM on the night train from Nanjing. Our reporter visited him at his residence on Columbia Road yesterday. Sun stated that the Legislative Yuan has published the draft constitution and is publicly soliciting opinions, hoping that all sectors of the country will provide as much criticism as possible. After collecting opinions from all parties, the Legislative Yuan will convene a general meeting to discuss revisions and create a second draft of the constitution.</p>
<p>Silver Agreement: Sun also stated that the Legislative Yuan has approved the Silver Agreement, but with a statement of reservation to avoid being restricted by the agreement. It will be submitted to the National Government for implementation and communicated to various countries by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before April 1st. This case was initially drafted by the Ministry of Finance based on the advice of its American advisors, with a statement of reservation. However, after careful discussion by the Legislative Yuan, it was deemed insufficient. Therefore, it was resolved to add a condition to the fourth item of the agreement, that is, China has the right to take necessary actions when Chinese industry is at risk, so as not to be restricted or bound by the agreement. As for the future ban on silver exports, there are various practical difficulties. Therefore, an effective method may focus on increasing the export tax on silver.</p>
<p>Cai and Others' Attempts:</p>
<p>Regarding the rumors that the Southwest intends to establish a branch of the Military Affairs Commission, with Chen Jitang as the chairman, Sun stated that this is managed by the military authorities, and he has not heard of it. As for the rumors that the main culprits of the Min Rebellion, Cai Tingkai, Chen Mingshu, etc., are still staying in Hong Kong and are planning something, Sun believes that the embers of the dead fire will be powerless, and he firmly believes that Mr. Hu Zhantang and others will not be utilized by such people.</p>
<p>Economic Commission Progress: Sun stated that the National Economic Commission recently convened several executive meetings. The overall direction remains as originally planned, with no major changes. Regarding the development of the Northwest, it is deemed urgent and cannot be delayed. Dai Jitao and Song Ziwen will go for on-site inspections. Dai and others are expected to depart within two or three weeks. The sluggish sales of American cotton and wheat affect the funding of the entire Economic Commission, making it difficult to implement all future construction plans. Further detailed discussions will be held based on the evolving situation to devise appropriate measures. When the reporter asked if, in case the construction of the Economic Commission and other matters cannot proceed due to lack of funds, whether there are plans to seek loans from other countries, Sun replied that it is indeed possible to seek loans from other countries to fund construction.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Qinzhou and Lianzhou Native Sugar Fined, Sugar Merchants File an Appeal <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the Ministry of Finance to Revoke the Customs' Decision</p>
<p>The shipment of native sugar from Qinzhou and Lianzhou to Shanghai was repeatedly detained and fined by the Jianghai Customs last year. Chambers of commerce from various counties in Qinzhou and Lianzhou, as well as sugar merchants, appointed Pang Songhui as their representative to petition the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance in Beijing. Details have been previously reported. It is now learned that the Customs Administration's reply rejected the request for the return of fines and supplementary taxes, and made no mention of measures to ensure the safety of future shipments. Relevant sugar firms in Shanghai and sugar merchants from Guangdong Province have expressed their dissatisfaction and unanimously decided to file an appeal to the Ministry of Finance. Pang Songhui, the petition representative, has drafted the appeal and will submit it to Beijing today. The original text is as follows: For the purpose of appealing against the Jianghai Customs' fines on Qinzhou and Lianzhou native sugar, being dissatisfied with the Customs Administration's decision, filing an appeal, requesting the revocation of the original decision, and making a more appropriate decision. The facts, reasons, and objectives of the request are stated as follows: (Facts) From July to September of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], Qinzhou and Lianzhou sugar merchants Heli, Henghelong, Guangchanghe, Heyi, and others shipped native white sugar from Beihai to Shanghai a total of five times. The exports were all verified by the Beihai Customs as pure native sugar, taxes were paid in accordance with regulations, and clearance documents were issued. However, upon arrival in Shanghai and reporting to the Jianghai Customs for inspection, the goods were completely detained and accused of being mixed with 10% to 20% foreign sugar, resulting in fines totaling 1,560 silver dollars and supplementary taxes of 1,957 silver dollars. Sugar merchants suffered innocent penalties and unbearable losses, leading to suspension of business and transportation, which had a very serious impact. The Beihai City Chamber of Commerce, together with the Hepu County Chamber of Commerce, convened all sugar merchants and resolved to adopt relief measures, appointing Songhui as their representative to petition in Beijing, which has been reported to your ministry. The Customs Administration's reply stated that, according to the Inspector General of Customs' investigation, the sugar was thoroughly inspected by the Jianghai Customs and found to contain unpaid foreign sugar. The merchants mixed unpaid foreign sugar with domestic goods, attempting to evade taxes. The Jianghai Customs imposed penalties in accordance with regulations, and the handling was appropriate. The request from the Beihai City Chamber of Commerce and others to return the fines and supplementary taxes should not be considered. Reading this reply is extremely difficult to accept and should be immediately appealed to your ministry, requesting the original decision to be revoked and a more appropriate decision made. (Reasons) The Jianghai Customs imposed heavy fines based on the accusation that Qinzhou and Lianzhou sugar merchants mixed unpaid foreign sugar with domestic goods, attempting to evade taxes. The appropriateness of the Jianghai Customs' penalties needs to be clarified: (1) Whether the Jianghai Customs' standard for distinguishing foreign sugar from native sugar is reasonable, (2) Whether the Jianghai Customs has proof for distinguishing taxed sugar from untaxed sugar, and (3) Whether the sugar merchants' ability to mix foreign sugar with native sugar can be used as a basis for judgment. The current method of distinguishing foreign sugar from native sugar by the Jianghai Customs, regardless of the place of origin or source, relies solely on the level of optical rotation and the difference in crystallization. Sugar with an optical rotation above 90 degrees and hard crystals is considered foreign sugar, while sugar with an optical rotation below 90 degrees and easily soluble crystals is considered native sugar. This standard violates customs policy and lacks factual basis. Since the increase in taxes on foreign sugar, the domestic sugar industry has developed rapidly. In Qinzhou and Lianzhou, the raw materials for sugar production used to be only large sugarcane and bamboo sugarcane, but in recent years, improved varieties such as "2725" and "2878" sugarcane have been introduced. The sugar production methods used to be only stone pressing, but in recent years, there have been so-called improved local methods and small-scale machine-made methods. Sugarcane production is improving daily. The Jianghai Customs has not paid attention to the progress of the production area and only knows how to use its three-year-old engraved standard, resulting in repeated detention and fines for improved Qinzhou and Lianzhou native sugar, while inferior sugar can be transported without hindrance. Is this inspection standard reasonable? It remains to be seen. According to the current tax system, foreign goods must pay import taxes before entering the mainland. Foreign goods that have already entered the mainland must be lightly taxed. Native goods must be verified for the collection of transit taxes before being released. Goods that have already obtained transit must be pure native goods with light taxes. Customs regulations are strict, and there is no room for fraud. Now, Qinzhou and Lianzhou sugar merchants transport native sugar from Beihai to Shanghai, holding documents verified and taxed by the Beihai Customs, and transport them directly to Shanghai. The documents match the goods, but the Jianghai Customs accuses them of being mixed with untaxed foreign sugar. On what basis is this accusation made? Is the document verified and taxed by the Beihai Customs valid? Is Beihai the mainland? The claim that it is untaxed is even more absurd. The intention is nothing more than because the inspected sugar is of better quality, exceeding its inspection standard of several years ago, it is judged to be mixed with foreign sugar. Since it is foreign sugar, it must be untaxed. Is this logic sufficient to prove that sugar merchants are evading taxes, or is it just giving customs officials a pretext for serious dereliction of duty? It does not need to be argued by the wise. Now that the Customs Administration has made such a reply, it cannot redress the grievances of the sugar merchants, and it will reduce the credibility of the government's customs administration. This is why the petitioners dare not remain silent. As for whether sugar merchants can mix foreign sugar with native sugar, it is the key to judging this case. The subjective understanding and objective facts are separately proved. Qinzhou and Lianzhou are rich in sugarcane and sugar, and the price is lower than any other production area in the country. Sugar products are only shipped out and rarely imported. Foreign sugar is heavily taxed and burdened with donations, and the freight is extremely high, almost non-existent in recent years. Retail sales in the market are only of coarse granulated white sugar No. 24, which costs 30 small silver dollars per load, while local white sugar costs only 16 or 17 silver dollars, a difference of almost double. Even if foreign sugar can be imported tax-free, the cost per load is more than 16 silver dollars, which is equal to native sugar. This is the market situation. Even if the government does not intervene, sugar merchants will not mix it, let alone confiscate it. This is proved from the perspective of understanding. The transportation of Qinzhou and Lianzhou native sugar to Shanghai is carried out by sailing ships from various sugar production areas to Beihai, where sugar taxes are collected by the Sugar Tax Bureau, and the goods are inspected by the Beihai Customs, and then exported to Shanghai by ship. The goods must be reported separately to the Beihai Customs and the Sugar Tax Bureau for inspection, and the transit tax must be paid, and the clearance documents must be given before they can be released. After inspection and loading, the attached sugar merchants cannot ask about the sugar. It is only when the goods are shipped directly to Shanghai that the consignee reports to the customs for import. The procedure is so strict that sugar merchants cannot mix foreign sugar with native sugar. This is proved from the perspective of fact. However, the Jianghai Customs still suspects that the Huainan native sugar shipped to Shanghai is transferred from Hong Kong and mixed. This is dare not to be said in other places where native sugar is expensive, or where it is transferred at will without inspection, and which takes Hong Kong as a gateway. However, under the above-mentioned special circumstances, the sugar merchants of Qinzhou and Lianzhou really cannot and will not borrow at all. In July last year, the native sugar attached by the sugar merchants Henghelong and other companies was fined four times, and it was all attached to Taikoo Steamship, which arrived in Shanghai from the original packaging in Beihai. It only temporarily anchored in Hong Kong and did not change ships for transfer. The native sugar carried by Yisun Wheel attached by Heli on August 28 went directly from Beihai to Shanghai and did not involve Hong Kong. Therefore, the suspicion of Jianghai Customs that it was transferred and mixed from Hong Kong is just a counter-evidence that the sugar merchants in Qinzhou and Lianzhou did not mix it at all. (Request Purpose) Based on the above facts and reasons, the petitioners have made a request in October last year, running around and appealing, and waiting for orders to suspend business. They originally hoped that those who were wronged by customs officials would be seen by the government. However, the Customs Administration has not yet conducted a detailed investigation, and only based on the report from the Inspector General of Customs and the Jianghai Customs, it has rejected the request, which is difficult to accept. He has always admired your Excellency for sympathizing with the difficulties of merchants, diligently seeking people's privacy, and for maintaining the industry in the past. He is using all his energy to state the details again and file an appeal in accordance with the law, respectfully asking you to conduct a thorough inspection and give special relief, revoke the decision of the Customs Administration, and accommodate the following requests: (1) Send personnel to the sugar production area of ​​Qinzhou and Lianzhou to conduct an on-site inspection, or allow the petitioner to collect sugar samples that have been publicly certified by local party and government agencies, mass groups, and send them to Beijing for inspection, and formulate measures to protect the safety of native sugar transit. (2) Order the Inspector General of Customs to return the fines and supplementary taxes in this case, and pray for their speedy implementation. Not only will the sugar merchants feel the injustice of Xue Fupen, but the future of customs administration will also be rectified. It is really for the convenience of both public morality. Respectfully submitted to the Minister of Finance Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Xing Juefei Talks About the Petition Process of Hainan Sugar <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Guarantee Case Has Been Approved by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The Redress Case is Still Being Reviewed</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that the sugar merchants of Hainan Island had repeatedly been detained, fined, and confiscated by the Jianghai Customs of Hainan Island when they transported sugar to Shanghai, causing the merchants to suffer and be unable to appeal. They sent representative Yao Xing Juefei to Beijing to petition for redress and guarantee. It is now heard that the petition conditions have come to an end, and Representative Xing has returned to Shanghai. The reporter also learned the details and reported them to the readers. He specially visited Xing at the Yuegong Hotel on North Sichuan Road. According to Xing, the petition process is as follows: This time, I was entrusted by the sugar merchants of Hainan Island and the Chamber of Commerce of Haikou City to go to Beijing to state the suffering of sugar merchants and sugarcane farmers to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Customs Administration, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and to appeal for guarantees. I was fortunate to have Premier Wang consider the people's livelihood, and accepted the advice of the lowly, and ordered the two ministries of Finance and Industry to handle this case together. Under the order of the two ministries, after several months of investigation, they have understood the crux of the problem, and after consultation, the following points have been made for the guarantee case: (1) Change the customs' sugar inspection standard, (2) Determine that the inspection power lies with the Hainan Customs. These two points really give merchants a lot of convenience. As for the redress case, the cases of Hesheng Jusheng will be handled separately, and it is proposed to mitigate the judgment to comfort the merchants' difficulties. For Yongcheng Qiongtai and Qiong Faxiang, the Ministry of Finance wants to maintain the original case, but I think that the Ministry of Finance cannot be fair in making amends, so I went to the Executive Yuan again to request that 40% of the supplementary tax be settled, and the confiscated and auctioned funds be returned to show fairness and convince the people. The President of the Executive Yuan also believes that this request is not without reason, so he ordered the Ministry of Finance to review it again for approval. This is the process of the petition case. However, this result depends entirely on the help of the national public opinion community, and the Shanghai Business Federation, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, and the Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai have also sent telegrams to strongly urge the central government to protect domestic products and maintain the Hainan native sugar, which has attracted the attention of the authorities. This is what I am very grateful for. Now that the case has come to an end, I will return to Hainan to report everything in a few days, but because the journey is in a hurry, I have not been able to say goodbye one by one, which is really a pity.</p>

<p>The Special Party Departments of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways yesterday telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, stating: To the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the puppet Puyi issued a declaration on November 20th of last year, changing the Manchu pseudo-state to the Manchu pseudo-empire, and usurping the throne on March 1st of this year. This shameless act originates from the Japanese imperialists' overall plan to invade China. Puyi willingly acts as a puppet, shameless and painful. The Northeastern traitors and remnants of the defunct Qing Dynasty, Zhao Xinbo, Zheng Xiaoxu, and others, with wolfish hearts and dog lungs, recognize the enemy as their father, accept their protection, and do not hesitate to lose their rights and humiliate the country, trying to sell out the country for personal gain. Anyone with blood and spirit is furious. Our nation is at a critical juncture of survival, and it is time for us to actively defend the country. We hereby telegraph your ministry to issue a clear order in the shortest possible time to mobilize the nation and launch a vigorous attack, so that the villains have nowhere to survive and the territory can be recovered.

<p>Ceremony Held at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Yesterday Afternoon</p>

<p>Venue Arrangement　The venue was the auditorium of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on Tianhougong Bridge. A white cloth banner reading "Citywide Boy Scouts Present Commemorative Tower" was hung in front of the stage. The commemorative tower stood below the stage, surrounded by colorful paper streamers. The atmosphere was orderly and solemn. Boy Scouts stood guard along the route at the entrance. The Shanghai Municipal Police sent a military band to play music at the venue.</p>
<p>Construction of the Bronze Tower　The tower was designed by Wang Gang of the Boy Scouts Council and cast by the Juvenile Supplies Supply Company at a cost of 200 yuan. It is made of bronze with a purple hue, stands three feet tall, and has a base diameter of one foot. It features a censer foot and a gourd-shaped top, with two sets of steps leading up in succession, totaling seven levels. Each level has six sides, resembling a palace with complete doors, windows, and distinct roof tiles. The entire structure is exquisitely crafted. When struck, it produces a resounding sound. On the lower section of the front of the tower, there are three lines of white characters: the top line reads "Presented to Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai," the middle line reads "The Shanghai Special Municipality Council of the Boy Scouts of China," and the bottom line reads "Presented by the Heads of Various Troops and the Citywide Boy Scouts." On the back, three lines are engraved with the mottoes "Be Prepared," "Do a Good Turn Daily," and "Service to Humanity is the Purpose of Life." The left and right sides are engraved with the twelve Boy Scout Laws: Honesty, Loyalty, Helpfulness, Kindness, Courtesy, Fairness, Obedience, Cheerfulness, Thrift, Bravery, Cleanliness, and Public Spirit, which are quite</p>
<p>deeply engraved.</p>
<p>Presentation Speech　The Boy Scouts Council prepared a special presentation speech to express their sincerity.</p>
<p>The text reads, "We, the Shanghai Boy Scouts, have observed that since your arrival in office, Mr. Mayor, you have spared no effort in promoting and supporting our cause. Your perseverance and enthusiasm are deeply appreciated. Therefore, we have pooled the modest resources of the citywide Boy Scouts to cast this ancient tower as a respectful gift to commemorate your contributions and express our admiration. Respectfully presented to Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai, by the Shanghai Council of the Boy Scouts of China, representing the citywide Boy Scouts, March 10, 1934."</p>
<p>Ceremony Held　When Mayor Wu Tiecheng arrived, Conductor Sun Yixin signaled with a bugle, and all the attending Boy Scouts stood at attention and saluted. Then, the meeting was opened with the ringing of a bell. After the formalities, the Chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by the presentation of the tower to Mayor Wu by representatives of the Girl Scouts, Bao Ruixin, the leader of the 196th troop, the Rover Scouts, the leader of the 270th troop, the Cub Scouts, Gan Yuanda, the leader of the 177th troop, the Boy Scouts, Yu Peng, the leader of the 349th troop, and Shen Yu, a staff member. After Mayor Wu received the tower, he delivered a speech of thanks, followed by speeches by Pan Gongzhan and others. The ceremony concluded with a group photograph and adjournment.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report　Chairman Tong Xingbai reported, in brief, that,</p>
<p>Today, the Shanghai Citywide Boy Scouts</p>
<p>hold a presentation ceremony of the tower. This fact breaks the record of all past activities. Since Mayor Wu took office, his advocacy for the Boy Scout cause has been unprecedented, enabling significant progress in the city's Boy Scout movement and providing encouragement to the citywide Boy Scouts. Therefore, the citywide Boy Scouts voluntarily donated funds to purchase this commemorative tower to express our gratitude.</p>
<p>The old saying goes, "Many grains of sand make a tower". This action deeply matches its meaning. Mayor Wu once said to me that he intended to carry out outdoor activities with the citywide Boy Scouts, which showed Mayor Wu's concern for the Boy Scout cause, and to live together. This is something that we are grateful for. If we want to restore the glory of the country, we must first seek the revival of the nation. To revive the nation, we must first eliminate the bad habits of the nation. The New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang is based on this. All the rules of the Boy Scouts are also to wash away China's old bad habits and create a new life. I believe that the Boy Scout life should not only be universal in the entire student community, but also be popularized to the entire nation. With Mayor Wu's love for the Boy Scouts, we should encourage each other to create a bright future for the Boy Scout movement.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech　In brief, he said, "Today, the Shanghai Boy Scout community holds this grand ceremony. I consider this the most honorable thing in my life, but at the same time, I cannot help but feel fearful. What is honorable is that the Chairman said that this is a pioneering event in the Boy Scout community in the past ten years. This action did not come from the Council or the leaders of various troops, but was purely initiated by the citywide Boy Scouts. Therefore, I deeply feel that this is the most honorable thing in my life. What is fearful is that although I am a revolutionary, I should take the revival of the Chinese nation as my own responsibility, and I should work hard to complete this mission. The starting point and foundation of national revival is the Boy Scout movement. The revolutionary party has an unshirkable duty to the Boy Scout movement. Although it is necessary to work hard, due to time and government affairs, I have not been able to devote all my efforts to this. Now, I am receiving such a grand commemorative gift. How can I not feel ashamed? Therefore, in the past, I really felt ashamed, and in the future, I will feel even more fearful. Therefore, I will make this memorial object my motto, so that I can be reminded and stimulated at any time to work hard for the mission of the revolution. For this starting point and basic work of national revival, such as the Boy Scout movement, I should be more self-motivated and work hard. I still have a few words to offer to you, and I hope that you can pass these words on to your relatives and friends. Today, the people of the whole country all take survival as the most urgent task. The so-called survival is the New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang in Nanchang. The so-called survival is nothing more than turning China into a new era of country, so that it has the strength to survive and can compete with other countries for survival.

<p>A country should pay attention to the modernization of the life of the entire nation. Today, the Chinese people have two extremely contradictory lifestyles: one is easily seen in cities, where life is extremely extravagant and hedonistic; the other is easily seen in the inland, where life is extremely miserable. Both of these violate the original meaning of the new era of life. The so-called new era of life should have a spirit of hard work, endurance, perseverance, and decisiveness. On the one hand, it aims to reduce the suffering of people's lives, and on the other hand, it cannot make them fall into extravagance and follow the footsteps of people in developed industrial countries in Europe and the United States. Since we take the revival of the nation as our mission, we should work hard to complete this mission, and we should pay more attention to the starting point and basic work of this national revival, such as the Boy Scout movement. In addition to expressing my gratitude, I will also use this memorial object as my motto to stimulate and remind me not to forget the important work in the process of national revival."</p>
<p>Joining the Boy Scouts　When the ceremony was about to end, Mayor Wu officially announced to the public that he was joining the Boy Scouts. Tong Xingbai and Pan Gongzhan also joined at the same time. The Boy Scout representatives applauded and cheered in unison.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Shanghai Municipal Council Considers Tax Exemption Requests <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese YMCA at 599 Sichuan Road raised an objection because the estimated donation amount had increased. After consideration by the Municipal Council, it was decided that the request could not be approved. Since the YMCA already receives a subsidy from the Municipal Council for education, it was decided to treat it the same as the Western YMCA, collecting the full amount of the donation but allowing a 10% reduction.</p>
<p>For the house at 1274 Jing'an Temple Road, the assessed rental value was 4,800 yuan, and the resident raised an objection. After consideration by the Finance Committee, it was decided that the assessed value of the house had been very low for many years and the discount had been in place for a long time. The newly determined assessed value could not be changed again.</p>
<p>Guangren Hospital rented the house at No. 21, Lane 608, Chengdu Road for hospital use and requested exemption from the general donation. The Municipal Council decided to approve it.</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Missionary Society (translated name) requested that two pieces of land occupied by them be exempted from land tax. After deliberation by the Finance Committee, it was decided that this tax exemption could only be limited to the land occupied by the church. Other buildings were not covered by this rule. Therefore, it was decided that out of the total land tax of 4609.69 yuan payable by the society, 89.1.34 yuan would be exempted. The above cases have all been approved by the board of directors and will be implemented accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Emergency Meeting of the 17th Branch of the Municipal Federation <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Wu Yong'an's Fraud Discovered</p>
<p>Write to the Court for Severe Punishment</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the 17th District Branch of the Shanghai Special First District Citizens' Union held its fifth executive committee meeting at its office on Sichuan Road at 2 PM yesterday. Guo Ruowen, Lin Shaoqiao, Lian Rongjiang,</p>
<p>Yan Jingwen, Wang Jian'e, Chen Minglai, Chen Jiufeng (Jiang representing), Yu Mingxun, Zhao Zhiyan, Li Qianheng, Tang Huilian, and others attended, totaling eleven people. Yu Mingxun was elected as chairman. After performing the formalities, the chairman reported that Wu Yong'an had defrauded money in the name of the association, which was related to the reputation of the association. Therefore, an emergency meeting was called to discuss the handling method.</p>
<p>Fraud Details Next, Wang Jian'e reported that on the evening of the 7th, a man named Wu Yong'an, accompanied by detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Police, came to the apartment to inquire because Wu Yong'an had fraudulently convened a so-called rent reduction movement for the Xinshunli, Yixingli, Yuqingli, Shenyuli, and Xujia Garden, all in the name of the 17th District Branch of the Citizens' Union. On the one hand, he charged a membership fee of one yuan to each shop and resident, and according to his confession, he had asked Jian'e for instructions. At that time, Jian'e was not at the apartment, and later learned about it, and was deeply shocked. Wu Yong'an was in the same company as Jian'e and was under his jurisdiction, but Jian'e regarded him as just one of the staff members. In the past, during conversations, he had asked Jian'e about the rent reduction movement and the organization of district branches, and was told that rent reduction must be initiated by the tenants themselves and must comply with the law and order. For example, the rent reduction proposal of the 17th District Citizens' Association is to gather the opinions of the majority of tenants and first negotiate with the landlord within the possible range. If you want to organize a district branch, you must submit it to the General Association, and then ask the party and government organs to approve the record, which is legal. Whoever intended Wu Yong'an to be harboring evil intentions, privately carved seals, printed receipts, and collected membership fees. This is not only unknown to Jian'e, but also conflicts with the resolution of the second executive supervisory committee meeting on January 22 that no fees will be charged externally. Now that Wu Yong'an has been arrested for committing a crime and has also shifted the blame on others, he is extremely illegal. From the standpoint of the district branch, we should study the methods of dealing with it and give it severe sanctions.</p>
<p>Resolution Methods Next, the discussion began to record the motion. (1) Wu Yong'an from Anhui fraudulently obtained money in the name of the association from Xinshunli, etc. on Tiantong Road outside the scope of the district. The court has already prosecuted, and how should the association claim it? The resolution, Wu Yong'an's fraudulent money in the name of the outside has been prosecuted by the court, and the association should send a letter to the court in the name of the executive committee to severely sanction it. (2) All external actions of the association are signed and sealed by the daily standing committee. Should we notify all members again to avoid misunderstandings? Resolved, notify again. (3) The association's organization of the rent reduction movement was resolved at the second executive supervisory committee meeting on January 23, and no fees will be charged externally. Should we make another statement? Resolved, the association's organization of the rent reduction movement is at the request of the citizens, in order to adapt to the social environment, so it is to relieve the pain as the first righteousness, and never</p>
<p>increase the burden on citizens, so all expenses are borne by the association. Now, in order to clarify the truth to all sectors, we will solemnly declare again, so that we can inform everyone.</p>

He studied diligently, determined to delve into research, his scholarship and conduct were outstanding, surpassing his peers. He strived for further studies, went to America, worked hard, and spent many years. He followed Christ, respected Heaven and loved others, compassionate and kind, bringing spring to all things. Our Lord said, "Blessed are those who give, not to be served, but to serve." You followed this teaching, established the Hudong Commune, resolved disputes and difficulties, and benefited laborers. You spoke in the halls, your voice was loud and clear, your words flowed like a river, and everyone felt like spring. For ten years of hard work, you were as one day. No one doubted your loyalty and integrity. With a robust physique and in the prime of life, you suddenly returned to Heaven due to a tooth ailment. Alas, Mr. Qian, you were a rare talent in this era, knowledgeable and insightful, yet you did not live long. Your old mother is in the hall, your wife is in the chamber, one son and seven daughters, alas, where do they turn? The cold wind is chilling, the setting sun is pale, a wise man has withered, our hearts are filled with sorrow. We have been through thick and thin together, not just for a day or a night. We dare to present these rough words to bid farewell to your tomb.' Finally, the students of the Hudong Commune sang a mournful song, the tone was sad and moving, making people feel heartbroken. After Qian's family expressed their gratitude, the meeting adjourned until after five o'clock."</p>

<h3 id="e148">Public Concession Bureau Candidate Director 布莽 Unexpectedly Has Bad Deeds Published by Russian Newspaper <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Great Impact on 布莽's Election This Year</p>
<p>Lawyer Jiang Yiping Sues the Newspaper's Editor</p>
<p>布莽 (transliteration), a Belgian citizen residing at No. 15 Museum Road in the Public Concession, an American citizen, is the editor-in-chief of an English magazine. He has a good reputation in Shanghai society and is one of the candidate directors of the Western taxpayers' meeting of the Public Concession Bureau. The election will be held in March of this year, and he has hope of being elected. Unexpectedly, on February 7th and 8th, the Russian-language newspaper "考克筆" (transliteration, meaning "a penny" in Russian), located on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, published</p>
<p>unflattering stories about 布莽's life, including defamatory language. 布莽 was shocked upon reading the newspaper. Because the newspaper publicly spread defamatory words, it had a great impact on his election and harmed his lifelong reputation. Therefore, he hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to represent him and filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing the Russian editor of "考克筆" newspaper, 吉列根 (transliteration), of defamation and requesting a legal investigation. The court accepted the complaint and summoned both parties at 11:30 am yesterday. Judge Wu Fanglian presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. First, lawyer Jiang Yiping, the agent of the plaintiff, stated the intention of the lawsuit and presented the newspaper as evidence. The defendant, 吉列根, was defended by lawyer Zhang Jiawei, who stated that the words in the defendant's newspaper were completely based on facts and contained no defamation. He requested the court to investigate with Mr. Zhong Si, the general manager of the British Public Concession Bureau, which would clarify everything. He also listed several witnesses and requested that they be summoned. The judge believed that the newspaper still needed to be translated and that it was necessary to investigate the case, so he ordered the hearing to be adjourned until a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e149">United Benefit Association of Fishery Merchants Protects Fish Fry Merchants <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting of Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>Petitioning the Government to Reiterate Prohibition Orders</p>
<p>Last year, the Shanghai Fishery Merchants United Benefit Association accepted the request of fish fry merchants for protection and immediately prepared a document to the Ministry of Industry, requesting that an order be issued for protection. The Ministry of Industry then sent a letter to the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministry of Interior, respectively ordering the governments of Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei provinces to instruct their subordinate military and police agencies to provide strict protection. Therefore, fish fry merchants traveling along the Yangtze River were not extorted by hooligans or others. In Shanghai, the association also submitted a petition to the party and government agencies in advance, requesting that the Public Security Bureau's water patrol team be instructed to send police to escort them when the time came. Therefore, last year, the fish fry merchants deeply appreciated the government agencies' effective protection. The fish fry season is approaching again this year. Recently, fish fry gang leaders such as Ji Debao sent a telegram to the association, requesting that petitions be sent to the government again to reiterate the prohibition orders, so as to avoid the loss of effectiveness over time and the merchants suffering losses. The association specially convened a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday, attended by Zhu Yangwu, Zhou Lianze, Shen Mingzhe, He Zongnian, Chen Ganfu, Yao Xingdao, (He Dai) Chu Genfu, Lu Weixin, Zhang Lansheng, Zhang Yuxiu, Wu Longsheng, and others. Zhu Yangwu was elected as chairman. The agenda included reports and discussions on the following: (1) More than 200 representatives from the fishing boat gangs, including Shi Changfa, requested to join the association; (2) Someone surnamed Qian proposed to contract the association's tugboat at a price cheaper than the market price; (3) Member Ji sent a telegram requesting protection for fish fry. Discussions: (1) Shi Changfa and others requested to join the association because they could not withstand the extortion by hooligans in the Songjiang waters. It was resolved to send someone to investigate the truth and then review the matter. (2) The fish fry season is approaching, and how should protection be provided? It was resolved: (1) To petition the Ministry of Industry; (2) To petition the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, and the Social Affairs Bureau; (3) To petition the Municipal Government to consult with the French Consul, instructing the French Concession police to provide protection. The section on loans is omitted.</p>

<p>Datong Road: Yesterday at around 5 pm, five robbers suddenly came to a certain family at No. 276 Datong Road. Two of the robbers had handguns, and three robbers guarded the front and back doors. The two armed robbers entered the house, told everyone to be quiet, and ordered the owner to hand over the keys to the boxes. They then went to each room, overturned boxes and chests, and looted at will. After about half an hour, they left with their loot. However, at this time, the owner saw that the shape of the handguns held by the two robbers was different. Upon closer inspection, they were fake. Just as he was about to find a way to capture them, the robbers had already fled. The owner hurriedly chased out, but saw that there were still accomplices outside the door. Fearing an ambush, he did not dare to make a sound. He returned to check the losses, which amounted to more than 1,700 yuan. He quickly reported to the police station in charge, requesting an arrest.</p>
<p>Aidoa Road: Yesterday at 7:20 pm, six robbers suddenly went to a certain business at No. 98 Aidoa Road. Four of them had handguns, and two were unarmed. After entering the shop, they shouted at the shop assistants and forbade them from making a sound. Two robbers walked into the counter to rob, and two other robbers broke into the upstairs, rummaging through each room. After about twenty minutes, they each fled with their loot. After checking, it was estimated that they had been robbed of banknotes, jewelry, clothes, etc., in a considerable amount. The owner reported to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate and search everywhere.</p>
<p>Daxi Road: At 9 am this morning, three robbers suddenly went to a certain family at No. 23 Rongkang Lane on Daxi Road.

<p>Three Kinds of Ceremonies Held Simultaneously</p>
<p>Lanterns Were Splendid and Unprecedented</p>
<p>Caohejing Town in West Shanghai suffered repeated military disasters in the past, and all places were ravaged. Only Caohejing was protected by the leader of the defense group, Yang Xinzheng, who took on the arduous task of entertaining soldiers and maintaining order. The whole town relied on him to be safe and sound. Local people praised him. Therefore, every year on March 8, 9, and 13 (that is, the 23rd, 24th, and 25th days of the Lunar New Year), lanterns are hung for three days to celebrate. This year is the tenth anniversary, and it also coincides with the opening of the Caojin Road, the completion of the Jinrong Bridge, and the establishment of the Huangjia Garden Fire Brigade. Various ceremonies are held simultaneously. A total of seven archways are decorated with lanterns in the east, west, north, and south. Every archway has couplets written by celebrities. The couplet of the east archway says, "Auspicious clouds come from the east to see the bridge, the Golden Bridge welcomes the tide to Puwei. Huang Garden looks west with joy, the road connects to Caojin. The fire brigade is formed." The couplet of the west archway says, "Candlelight reflects the clear waves, several curves of the clear stream are initially dredged. Lantern light deceives the bright moon, a new road shines for speeding." The couplet of the central archway says, "Preventing disasters and defending against troubles, we celebrate the peace of one side. Everyone watches the people lighting lanterns." Another couplet says, "From east to west, everything we see is lanterns and streamers. From the center to the outside, we can travel and enjoy the singing."</p>
<p>The rest are too numerous to mention. At 7 pm, people from all walks of life participated in the lantern parade, including military bands, Jinrong School Boy Scouts, Huangjia Garden Fire Brigade, and various lanterns. The parade extended for more than three miles, and the audience was crowded. Along the way, there were security offices, public security bureaus, and military and police of the defense group, working together to maintain order.</p>

Considering the large number of refugees, it was inevitable that there would be rice grabbing. In order to standardize the procedures, tens of thousands of rice tickets were specially made, each for four liters, and distributed according to the number of family members. People could collect rice with the tickets to avoid crowding. The names and addresses were registered when the tickets were collected for accounting purposes. The distribution began in the disaster area on the morning of the 10th.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Shareholders' Meeting of the China National Products Company <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The China National Products Company, located in the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road, held its shareholders' meeting on the 10th of this month at the Lake Society on Beijing Road. Chairman Fang Yexian first reported on the company's business situation last year and the process of increasing capital. He briefly stated that since the company opened on February 9th last year, it felt that the original northern emporium was too small to meet the needs of customers. Therefore, it was decided at a special shareholders' meeting last year to establish a southern emporium. At the same time, due to the establishment of the southern emporium, it was decided to increase capital by 100,000 yuan. This capital was fully collected last year, and the southern emporium has already been established, etc. Next, he described the situation of purchasing goods, briefly stating that when the company was established, very few factories participated. After the southern emporium was established, the number of factories trading with the company reached 500, and to date it has exceeded 1,400. Among them, small factories account for the majority. Although their products are excellent, the market's recognition is still limited. Today, the company's promotion of their products is tantamount to opening up a new path for them, etc. Next, he described the sales situation, briefly stating that the company's sales methods include wholesale, mail order, and retail departments, with the retail department being the core of the business. The pricing of various goods strives to be low, so the results are still satisfactory. Now, national products emporiums and national products stores that have followed the company are everywhere, which may also be good news for the future of national products, etc. Next, he described the publicity work, such as holding the Chicago Exposition, the Children's Amusement Market, and the Fashion Show, etc., all of which had a good impression. Next, he described the financial and business situation, stating that with the enthusiastic support of all parties, everything was well-arranged and reassuring to the shareholders, etc. However, under the sluggish market conditions last year, the company was fortunate to have a slight surplus. In the future, as the market gradually turns around, colleagues should encourage themselves more and live up to the shareholders' trust, etc. Next, the supervisor Yan Fang reported on the account briefly. Next, there was the distribution of surplus, amendment of articles of association, and election of directors and supervisors. In addition to the re-elected directors Wang Zhixin, Ren Shigang, Cai Shengbai, Zhang Huikang, and Fang Yexian, six new directors were elected, namely Shi Liangcai, Shi Haifeng, Yan Fang, Pan Yangyao, Fang Jiange, and Ye Youcai. The supervisors elected were Cheng Nianpeng, Sun Ruihuang, and Wang Zhenmao.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Bandit Li Chunsheng and Others Repeatedly Committed Murder Cases, All with Labor Union Political Connections <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The families of the victims have had difficulties for many years in investigations.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Yangshupu robbery case and the assassination case were heard first.</p>
<p>Wu Wanzhang appeared in court to testify about the shooting.</p>
<p>Detective Wang Cheng of the Chinese Detective Force and detective Yang Xiguang arrested four bandits, Cao Zhenxi, Xu Debiao, Du Baoliang, and Li Chunsheng, at the Dexinglou Restaurant at 1719 Tangen Road at 12:30 am on the 24th of last month. A pistol and eight bullets were found on Cao. Subsequently, two accomplices, Tang Xuyou and Ma Linxiang, were captured and brought to the police station. They confessed to robbing a residence at No. 5 Donglai Lane, Yangshupu Road, in September last year, stealing dozens of silver dollars worth of property. It was also investigated that these people, at approximately 4:00 am on January 22nd of this year, led a gang to rob the Derenhua Products Factory at No. 914 Gonghe New Road, Zhabei, and opened fire, killing the manager, Tang Xiangshou, a Ningbo native. Subsequently, it was found that Li Chunsheng, on December 12th of the 18th year of the Republic of China, colluded with Xia Shaoqiu, Gu Rufang, Ding Yunsheng, Liu Shanzhou, and Wang Ruiting, Fu Shatang, to assassinate Xie Baosheng (also known as A Bao), an Anhui native, on Putuo Road. Xie was a foreman at an internal and external cotton yarn factory. The defendants were separately escorted by the Jiaxing Road Police Station to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. It was found that Li Chunsheng, Fu Shatang, and others had joined the labor union, advocating for the overthrow of capitalism. In addition to murdering Xie A Bao, they had also colluded with the already arrested and punished leader Kong Guangfu between December of the 15th year of the Republic of China and March of the 17th year of the Republic of China, successively killing Dai Dianchen, Shi Jinkun, Zhang Liangcai, a woman named Bao Dongshi, and Wu Wanzhang, a Hubei native, on Putuo Road, Gordon Road, and Tokyo Road. Wu Wanzhang was also shot and wounded, but fortunately did not die. There were a total of six incidents, all related to political connections. Yesterday morning, the police sent Cao Zhenxi, Fu Shaotang, and others to the Third Criminal Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that in addition to the Xie Baosheng murder case, the other five cases had not yet been prosecuted due to incomplete procedures. It takes considerable time to investigate and summon the families of the victims. Only Wu Wanzhang has appeared in court. Now, after questioning Cao Zhenxi about the Yangshupu robbery case and Wu's attempted murder case, the hearing will be postponed for further investigation, and a special hearing will be scheduled, etc. The court approved it. According to the defendant Tang Xuyou, the Yangshupu robbery case in September last year was committed by two fugitives named Zhang and Liu. He did not receive any money. At approximately 3:00 pm on February 23rd of this year, the pistol carried by Cao was not his property. Xu Debiao stated that according to Zhang, the pistol in the Yangshupu robbery case belonged to Tang Xu. Cao Zhenxi stated that the firearm seized from him was given to him by Li Chunsheng to take to Hongkou, promising to pay him three yuan. Li Chunsheng stated that he had a feud with a man named Yang Wenzhun and instructed Cao to falsely accuse him. Subsequently, his mother, Li Lu, testified that Yang Wenzhun had a feud with her son and promised Cao a reward of fifty yuan to implicate him. Cao denied this. Next, the investigation of the attempted assassination of Wu Wanzhang case proceeded. According to Wu, he worked as an inspector in an internal and external yarn factory, but did not join the labor union. He lived near Deyou Lane, Putuo Road, and had a lecture hall. Fu Shaotang also worked as an inspector. Prior to the incident, Fu came to Wu's house, and on the third occasion, invited Wu to give a speech at the lecture hall. Wu went with his wife and family. As soon as they entered the lane of the lecture hall, they suddenly heard a gunshot from behind, and a bullet struck Wu's neck, exiting from the front. The second shot hit Wu's wife's arm. Turning around, he saw a short person wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, and a peaked cap, fleeing north. Fu then sent Wu to the hospital for treatment. Later, he entrusted Gu Rufang, also a colleague, to inquire with the labor union about the attempted murder. It was said that the shooter was named Wang A San, and the reason was that Wu was considered a running dog of the capitalists and had not joined the labor union, so he was shot. If he paid 100 silver dollars and hosted a banquet, there would be no further trouble. According to Gu Rufang, Wang Ruiting informed him of this matter, and it was instigated by a Kong. Wu was to be beaten to death. The shooter was said to be Tao San, etc. Li Chunsheng denied shooting and committing the crime. Wu Wanzhang stated that he admitted at the police station that a Shen from the labor union had ordered him to be shot. Moreover, the person who shot him at that time was of the same stature as Li Chunsheng. Fu Shaotang initially denied being an accomplice, but later stated that the matter was under the orders of Kong Guangfu, a key figure in the labor union, and Zhang Jianyou was instructed to lure Wu to the lecture hall lane to carry out the act. He was truly unable to disobey the labor union's orders and had no choice, pleading for consideration. Judge Xiao Xiezhen ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for the afternoon of the 23rd of this month for further verification.</p>

<p>At around 7:00 pm on the 7th, a traveler resembling a businessman came to the Pacific Hotel at No. 430 Guangxi Road to check in. The hotel's accountant led him to room 22. He claimed his name was Yang Rengen, 28 years old, a local, and he had no luggage or other items. For several days, he went to bed early and got up early, stayed indoors, and there were no abnormalities. However, yesterday he did not get up until noon. He immediately called the waiter into the room and asked him to bring some cold water. The waiter asked if he wanted lunch, but he shook his head and said, "I still need to take a nap." He told him to call him again at 7:00 pm. The waiter agreed and left, and Yang closed the door and went to sleep. At 7:00 pm in the evening, the waiter went to knock on the door on time, but there was no response for a long time. He then opened the door and went inside, and saw Yang lying across the bed, his face pale. On the table in the room, there was an empty box of red phosphorus matches. Asking him what happened, he was evasive. The waiter hurriedly reported to the accounting room, who reported to the police station. The detective sent Yang to Renji Hospital for treatment. After the hospital doctor rescued him, he found that he had taken a tranquilizer and then swallowed red phosphorus to commit suicide. Fortunately, he vomited it out shortly after, and his life was not in danger. After he woke up, he claimed that his real name was Yang Rengen and he was from Hangzhou. When asked why he wanted to commit suicide, he firmly refused to tell the truth.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e179">On the Steps of Literary Study, Writing, and Others (2) <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Above, we have done a check on the plans of Wang, Chen, Guo, and Jin to study literature, and briefly shown our criticism of them. Below, we put forward some more specific opinions to consult with the general readers. Editor</p>
<p>In principle, our plan for studying literature, no matter what steps we take, should be preliminary, introductory, general, and conceptual in the overall aspect. We cannot set the scope too wide or too high now, so as not to be out of touch with reality in application. We are not saying that there should absolutely not be too broad and too high a scope; however, that is a further step. After the "preliminary, introductory, general, and conceptual" has a "considerable foundation," you can find your way around in your research. At that time, no matter how high and broad your plans are, you can also have methods to deal with them properly. We learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and contribute a preliminary research plan for you with our own opinions.</p>
<p>First Phase | Focus on reading a few introductions to literature, dozens of works of creation, and exploring the basic knowledge of social sciences.</p>
<p>Second Phase | Focus on the study of literary theory.</p>
<p>Third Phase | In addition to continuing to deepen the above two research items, also explore creative methods.</p>
<p>Books to read in the first phase, for the basic knowledge part of social science, you can refer to the book list listed in the "Preliminary Reading of Social Sciences" article in this column on February 21, 22, and 23.</p>
<p>There are many literary theory books to read in the second phase. Let's list a few:</p>
<p>㈠ Theory of Art, Dajiang Edition</p>
<p>㈡ Modern Literary Trends, Kaiming Edition</p>
<p>㈢ Collection of Essays on New Realism, Modern Edition</p>
<p>㈣ Sociological Research on Literature, Dajiang Edition</p>
<p>㈤ Various Problems of Modern Emerging Literature, Dajiang Edition</p>
<p>㈥ Criticism of Literary Studies, Shuimo Edition</p>
<p>Books to read in the third phase on literary creation methods:</p>
<p>㈠ On Composition, Commercial Press Edition</p>
<p>㈡ Creative Experience, Tianma Edition</p>
<p>㈢ Literary and Artistic Technical Revolution, Dajiang Edition</p>
<p>As for the selection of literary works to be read in each period, in our opinion: read modern first and then ancient, and take into account both domestic creations and translations from foreign countries. This meaning has been explained before, so I will not repeat it. Modern Chinese writers such as Zhou Zuoren, Zhou Shuren, Guo Moruo, Tian Han, Hong Shen, Ding Ling, Ba Jin, Shen Congwen: : : and others' creations; translated works such as Ibsen and Shaw's dramas, Sinclair, Gorky, Remarque, Serafimovich, Fadeev and others' novels.</p>
<p>Of course, there are more than just these few people's things that can be read: but based on the readers' time, learning ability, etc., it is impossible to come up with a book list that everyone thinks is completely flawless. Readers should remember that Liang Rengong and Hu Shi fought a big ink battle a few years ago because of drafting a national studies book list, but it ended without results. But a multi-faceted book list is still useful, even though it is very miscellaneous or very incomplete. When you go to a restaurant for dinner, the restaurant gives you a menu. Although you still have to listen to the diners' own choices and decisions, people who don't often go to restaurants can't order dishes.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about writing. Chen Jun's questions are: ㈠ Before starting to write, is it right to first stipulate the meaning of the writing, that is, the central idea? ㈡ After writing well, I often feel that I still cannot express four-tenths of what I want to write, so I destroy it all. Should this kind of behavior be done?</p>
<p>For the first question, we will talk about it in two levels. First, the work should have its central idea, which is the law of nature. The so-called central idea is the content. Without content, it is not a work, but just the literary game of boring literati that we mentioned above. Second, the production process of general works is that social reality is reflected in the writer's nerve center and gradually condenses into an idea. Then, it is copied to paper in concrete images: as shown in the following table: Reality ↓ Idea ↓ Work Writer's idea concrete expression ←→ Reality. It is reality that stipulates your central idea, not you yourself who can create a central idea out of thin air. The central idea has not yet condensed in your brain. In other words, you don't even know what to write well before you write it, and the result is that you have experienced a miscarriage.</p>
<p>For the second question, we assume that Chen Jun has a central idea before he starts writing, then Chen Jun's spirit of seeking perfection is admirable. This kind of manuscript destruction is not only a common phenomenon for beginners, but also for writers who have been famous all over the world from ancient times to the present. (Please refer to the Reading and Q&amp;A on March 4, 5, 6, and 7: Reading and Writing) We don't think this is a failure and become discouraged: With the effort to seek perfection: one day you can climb the road to success, but we still have a word to say to Chen Jun: It is best not to destroy the unsatisfactory manuscript, and keep it to review it when you have time. Modify it slowly little by little, and sometimes these things will become useful with the increase of your experience and skills. For example, when sewing new clothes, having old clothes as a base for reference, it is easier to measure the new clothes to fit.</p>
<p>Jin Jun said: "The more difficult my position is and the more difficult it is to study, the more determined my will to seek knowledge! For myself, for the way out of the whole society. I struggle, and I try my best to struggle: : :" This makes us really happy. However, in this regard, Jin Jun is still like the letters from many readers. He loves literature. However, on the one hand, he feels that it is "presumptuous" for a busy person like him to love literature. On the other hand, he dislikes the hard life of literature and wants to give it up, but he can't give it up. This is a contradiction. If Jin Jun and other friends who love literature don't regard literature as something that high-ranking hermits in the "ivory tower" use to chant poems and play with the moon, then how can there be so-called presumption or non-presumption? If culture is not related to our busy people, this kind of culture is undesirable. Since we regard our pursuit of knowledge as struggling for ourselves and for the way out of the whole society, then what is there to dislike about being poor?</p>
<p>We still hope that you will continue to study with your original intention.</p>
<p>Many readers complained in their letters after raising certain questions that they had repeatedly submitted articles to publications but had not received the glory of publication. Many people have therefore been discouraged from practicing writing. Gao Ping said: "People who are a little familiar with the current situation of the Chinese publishing industry should know that 99% of the manuscripts of unknown writers will not be favored by editors. The reason is not in the "quality" of the works of unknown writers. No, few of our editor gentlemen are willing to take a look at the works of unknown writers. A well-intentioned explanation is that the general editors are too busy and don't have time to do the work of "sifting sand for gold": A malicious explanation is that unknown writers and editors have no relationship, and the "writer" is unknown, which is not enough to "help" the editor's "busy". The "fart" of writers with status is also "fragrant"! This is also why some "Shanghai School" literati's social basis has been discovered in recent years.</p>
<p>Although this is a bit too harsh on the editors, it is also part of the truth. At the same time, Gao Ping Jun has let go of the editors' difficulties. We think that we don't need to blame others, let's work hard on our own!</p>

<h3 id="e180">Western Constabulary Wins the Scott Cup: Eastern China Suffers a Crushing Defeat of Two to Zero Yesterday <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Li Ning Injured After 15 Minutes, Ten Men Fight Hard Until the End</p>
<p>Western Constabulary Tall and Strong, De Fei Scores Once in Each Half</p>
<p>In the Scott Cup final between Eastern China and Western Constabulary, Eastern China unfortunately suffered a crushing defeat of zero to two yesterday, falling short of success. The Scott Cup was thus won by Western Constabulary. Fifteen minutes into the match, after Western Constabulary scored a goal against Eastern China, the key defender Li Ning was also injured at the same time. Li withdrew from the match from then on, and Eastern China fought hard with ten men until the end. Western Constabulary's center forward De Fei scored once in each half, making him the great hero of Western Constabulary. Yesterday, the spring weather was chilly, with drizzle coming intermittently, greatly affecting the audience, which was only about 60%, or five to six thousand people. Eastern China's crushing defeat left everyone disappointed and returning home.</p>
<h3 id="e181">How Can One Not Be Defeated Under Violence? <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Eastern China's failure, and Li Ning's injury, was certainly one of the important reasons. However, even if Li Ning had not been injured, it would have been extremely difficult for Eastern China to win. Western Constabulary's height and strength are truly undeniable. Eastern China has many small and nimble players, and Dai Wan and the three forwards suffered losses everywhere. The lineup in the second half was extremely chaotic and flustered. Fortunately, Zhou Xianyan sat guard in the goal, and Western Constabulary's shots were inaccurate, otherwise the defeat would have been worse. Forward Wan Xianghua still had three or four good performances. Little Dai was at a disadvantage due to Galsworthy, and Chen Hongguang was forced to fill in as center back, which was very bad. Wu Youliang was still satisfied, and Feng Yunyou retreated to defense. This tune has not been played for a long time, and the ball cannot be sent. It is trapped under violence for a long time. How can one not be defeated?</p>
<h3 id="e182">Western Constabulary Fiercely Attacks, Eastern China Counterattacks <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Linos blew the whistle, and Western Constabulary kicked off. The wind was very strong, and Eastern China was happy to have the wind at its back. Western Constabulary pressed heavily, and Feng Yunyou made a clearance. Holey came again, touched the ball with his hand and retreated in front of Eastern China's goal. Wu Youliang sent the ball far away, and Jia Youliang was knocked down by Turner. Jia kicked a corner kick, and the angle was very good, but it was saved by Xu De. Wu Youliang's free kick was passed by Feng to Li Yichen. Jia Youliang shot fiercely from the right corner, but it was blown behind the goal by the wind, which was a pity.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Li Ning Injured, Iron Gate Broken <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The opportunities were still equal. Western Constabulary came back again. Peter shot, and Holness was offside. When it was almost a quarter of an hour, Peter rushed fiercely in the right corner, and Dr. Tu was knocked down. Jack carried the ball in, and Feng Yunyou lost his footing. Jack went away like flying. Feng Yunyou chased after him to intercept the ball and send it to Li Ning. De Fei came in at the same time. Li Ning let the horse go, and De Fei was already approaching the goal directly. Li Ning saw that the situation was critical, and he rushed forward desperately to rob the ball. Unexpectedly, both sides came in fiercely, and as a result, Li Ning did not steal the ball, but his ankle was injured. He left the field for treatment, and Te Fei took advantage of Eastern China's shaken morale and rode in like a flying horse, shooting diagonally. Zhou Xianyan failed to save the ball, and the record was opened.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Panicked and Missed Good Opportunities <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>After applying medicine and bandaging, Li Ning limped onto the field, still thinking about fighting with injuries, but his ankle was broken and the pain was unbearable, and he finally withdrew from the team. Feng Yunyou was transferred to the third line of defense, and Hongguang reluctantly took on the role of center back, holding on to the overall situation. Holness got a corner kick, and De Fei headed it into the goal, but the referee's eyes were sharp and he saw that Jack was standing in an offside position, so he blew the whistle and invalidated the goal. O'Daye was too troubled by Galsworthy and could not move as much as he wanted, but he could also make a warning rush from time to time. Li Yichen, with the help of Little Wan, rushed to the goal and shot low with his foot, but it was caught by Adelman. After being bumped by Jia, the ball was lost again, and Adelman caught the ball again and fell down. Li Yichen also fell on Adelman, and the referee considered it illegal and kicked the ball out of danger. Holness kicked another corner kick, and Wu Youliang met it and headed it out. Dai Linjing got the ball and passed it to the front of the goal with an extremely wonderful pass, but Li Yichen was too anxious and missed the opportunity. After that, Eastern China's forward got a good opportunity in front of Western Constabulary's goal, but time was not on their side, and they still worked in vain.</p>
<h3 id="e185">De Fei Scores Again, the Whole Army Suffers a Crushing Defeat <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, the Li Ning that everyone was looking forward to was still hidden, and the fans all looked forward to him as if they were waiting for the years, feeling that if the teacher does not come out, what will happen to the common people? After switching positions, Western Constabulary got the help of the wind again, and frequently threatened Eastern China greatly. Fortunately, Feng Yunyou was loyal and courageous, and Guan Xun kept the peace and guarded the danger alone, and Zhou's quick hands and eyes, although living in stormy seas, could fortunately maintain the original state and not lose again and again. Jebson fouled, and Tu Kaiyuan flew into the sky, but it did not materialize. Li Yichen grabbed the ball improperly, and was penalized for Galsworthy to kick straight to the goal from 40 yards away. Te Fei turned around and hooked the ball into the goal. In less than three minutes, Peter crossed from the low line and Te Dai shot it in, but Holey took the first step and was offside. After that, Eastern China had several desperate attacks, but they were still unable to score, and they suffered a crushing defeat with a score of two to zero.</p>

The total value of the school's movable and immovable property is 134,524 yuan, with an annual interest of 3,600 yuan. The school's open financial management method is still considered complete. The school buildings for the men's and women's departments occupy a total area of 19 acres and 54 square meters. There are 15 full-time teachers and 23 part-time teachers. The total number of students in the undergraduate, normal, and children's training classes is 378, including men and women. Since the school was established, a total of 872 male students and 27 female students have graduated. (Inspection Opinions) (1) The school building for the men's department is not very adequate, and the practice field is also too small. A suitable track and field stadium should be planned and constructed immediately. The school building for the women's department is a rented civilian house, which is not suitable, and the practice field is also too small. The school authorities have a plan to move the women's department to the men's department, and build a new school building for the men's department. Plans should be made quickly to ensure realization. (2) According to actual investigation, many of the school's full-time teachers also teach part-time outside. In the future, more full-time teachers should be hired as much as possible, so that they can do their best to develop school affairs. (3) In the school's total economic expenditure, salaries account for 78%, and equipment costs only account for 8%, which is too far from the ministry's equipment standards (at least 15%). Funds should be raised as soon as possible to expand equipment. (4) In terms of teaching, there are many technical subjects and fewer theoretical subjects. The curriculum distribution seems to be not very appropriate, and students should be required to bring notebooks when attending theoretical science classes, and record the materials outside of the textbooks and lectures in detail. Also, students' levels are uneven. In the future, the entrance examination should be strict when admitting new students, and the recruitment of special students should be stopped. (5) Male students eat outside the school, lacking the opportunity for communal living. The method of improvement is that students should take care of their own meals in the school. The addition of a cafeteria seems to be imminent. Also, the library equipment is too simple and should be purchased as soon as possible, and all equipment in the library should be improved, so that students have the opportunity to study automatically. (6) The school's funding is short, relying entirely on tuition fees to make up for it. In the future, funds should be raised to increase funds.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Two Private Patriotic Girls' Middle School Physical Education Department <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The annual expenditure is 75,374 yuan, the fund has movable property of 15,086 yuan, immovable property of 102,000 yuan, and interest of 1,000 yuan. The school building area occupies 14 acres and is valued at 2,600 yuan. There are 21 full-time teachers and 8 part-time teachers. The total number of students is 228, including 29 physical education students. The school stipulates a three-year plan for the future, in terms of physical education, the first year is to enrich the physical education curriculum, and compile a physical education curriculum outline, and add a gym and softball field, etc. The second year is to expand the track and field field and plan to build a swimming pool. The third year is to improve the level of physical education and plan to set up a specialty.</p>
<p>(Inspection Opinions) (1) The physical education department is attached to the Patriotic Girls' School. Because the school's entire organization is still strict, the administrative organization of the physical education department is also generally complete. (2) The salaries, construction costs, and equipment costs of the physical education department are all calculated in the school's total expenses. The department's own expenditure is about 1,000 yuan per year. It is not easy to understand how it is distributed. For the convenience of statistics and for future development, the physical education department should have a separate budget and final accounts. (3) The school's entire school building was destroyed in the January 28th Incident. The school authorities were able to work hard to restore it in a short period of time and have a revitalization plan. The spirit is commendable. However, a suitable track and field field should not be lacking for a long time and should be built as soon as possible. (4) The number of students in each grade of the physical education department is too small, especially in the first and third grades. When teaching technical subjects, it is not easy to group practice due to the small number of people, and there are many difficulties. Now, the number of students should be enriched to improve the efficiency of teaching. (5) All the books in the physical education department's office should be opened in a separate room for the use of students in the physical education department, or the school's library should be expanded and a physical education library reading room should be opened separately, so that students in the physical education department have the opportunity to read freely. (6) The school's implementation of moral education is still appropriate, and student discipline is also good. Students in the physical education department should pay more attention to the implementation and management of moral education in the future, so that they can take on the responsibility of moral education within the possible scope when they teach in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Three Private Southeast Women's Physical Education Normal School <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The annual expenditure is 24,205 yuan, the fund has movable property of 20,000 yuan, and all the school buildings are newly built. There are 13 full-time teachers and 10 part-time teachers. The total number of students is 101. The school stipulates that each student must participate in an extracurricular sports activity every day, which is organized by the student union's sports department, and the teacher is only responsible for guidance and supervision. The school plans to build a swimming pool in the spring of 1934.</p>
<p>(Inspection Opinions) (1) Although the school's administrative organization seems simple, because the responsible personnel are always stationed at the school, they can concentrate their energy, and teachers and students are united. (2) The school has a fitness room, which seems to be sufficient for indoor classes, but the outdoor space is still too small, and it seems necessary to expand it as soon as possible. (3) The library reading area is too small and should be expanded. (4) The school's curriculum distribution is still appropriate, and students' notebook grades are also mostly commendable. However, the teachers who teach the main courses also teach the courses of another full-time teacher who leaves the school halfway. One person's energy is limited and it is difficult to complete the teaching satisfactorily. One or two more full-time teachers should be hired immediately. (5) The gymnastics teaching materials seem to be outdated and should adopt more Danish and German new teaching materials. (6) The school does not accept day students and the distribution of dormitory members is also quite appropriate. The management is quite orderly and student discipline is also good. However, in addition to sports activities, extracurricular activities such as debate meetings, concerts, academic discussion meetings, and excursions should be held regularly to adjust students' lives in school.</p>

<p>Annual Expenditure: 17,160 yuan; Funds: Movable assets 40,000 yuan, Immovable assets 65,000 yuan; School buildings: Except for the rented student dormitories, the rest are self-built; Teachers: 10 full-time, 15 part-time; Students: 150 in total; Future plans: The school plans to build a three-story school building within two years, including a gymnasium, a swimming pool, and a dormitory that can accommodate 500 people. The construction and equipment costs are estimated to be 160,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(Inspection Opinions) (1) The main staff of the school have too many concurrent teaching assignments. In the future, more full-time teachers should be hired to reduce the burden on important staff and ensure that all teachers and staff fulfill their duties. (2) The gym seems too small and should be expanded. The student dormitories are overcrowded and located off-campus, requiring students to cross the road to attend classes, which is very inconvenient for management. The school authorities have a plan to build a new school building and must proceed with it as soon as possible to achieve it in the short term. Also, the athletic field has not yet been built and should be added quickly. (3) In terms of teaching, technical subjects seem too heavily emphasized, while theoretical subjects are too few, which does not align well with the prescribed curriculum. Active reorganization and improvement are needed. (4) The school's student uniforms are very neat and tidy, and the students appear lively and cheerful. They hold morning exercises once a day, and the discipline is quite good. However, the average age of the first-year students is only 17, which seems too young. In the future, stricter attention should be paid to their admission qualifications when enrolling new students. (5) Because the school's dormitories are insufficient, the original library was converted into a temporary dormitory, which is a serious mistake. A separate library should be established as soon as possible for students to conduct independent research.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Five Private China Women's Physical Education Normal School <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Annual Expenditure: Estimated at 15,630 yuan; School Buildings: All are rented; Teachers: 8 full-time, 17 part-time; Students: 71 in total.</p>
<p>(Inspection Opinions) (1) The school's administrative organization seems scattered, and there are too many staff members, which hinders the progress of school affairs. Two full-time teachers and several staff members should be hired as soon as possible. (2) The school's financial situation is quite tight, and funds should be raised immediately to strengthen the school's foundation. (3) All school buildings are rented civilian houses, which are not suitable. The practice area is particularly small, and a new site should be found to build suitable school buildings as soon as possible. (4) Much of the school's equipment was destroyed in the January 28th Incident and should be purchased as soon as possible to facilitate teaching. (5) The hygiene course is being taught diligently, and the dance teaching materials are quite novel and usable. However, the allocation of other courses is not entirely appropriate, and the number of teachers seems insufficient. The new salary standard seems lower than other schools. All of the above points should be improved urgently. (6) The students' spirit is still good, and the dormitories are kept clean. However, the school buildings are not suitable, and the equipment is incomplete, resulting in fewer opportunities for students to conduct independent research. Under these circumstances, a library should be established first to meet urgent needs. (7) The school has a primary school to provide senior students with practical opportunities, which is a good approach. However, the student teaching time seems too long. At the same time, having senior students serve as primary school teachers will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the primary school children. In the future, in addition to having a primary school, the school should have full-time teachers responsible for teaching duties. At the same time, the student teaching hours for senior students should also be carefully regulated.</p>
<p>(General Remarks) Inspector Hao deeply feels that the equipment of each school is simple and the teachers are lacking, which is a common phenomenon.</p>

<p>The 9th Shanghai International Basketball Tournament opened last night at the China Basketball Hall. In the first men's game, China was unfortunately defeated by the United States 29 to 42. Hopes for the future seem dim. As for the women's games, there is still one women's game. England defeated the Federation 20 to 10. The game situation is as follows:</p>

<p>The England and Federation teams had even skills. The England women won because of their tall and strong physiques. At the beginning of the game, the Federation's Kebi opened the scoring.

At the beginning of the second quarter, the Federation's Clark scored first. The England team returned the favor with a point. The score was 10 to 6 at the end of the first half.

The England team took the opportunity to make a strong push and scored ten consecutive points. The Federation fell into an irreparable situation.

<p>| 29 to 24 |</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the two sides fought fiercely. Because Pan Mengzhi fouled, the American Bausek got a free throw and scored one point. After the record was opened, the Chinese team refused to be outdone. Chen Jucai scored a goal and made a free throw. The American women then scored two consecutive goals. At the end of the first quarter, the United States led 5 to 3. At the beginning of the second quarter, the Chinese team responded calmly. Chen Rongming scored a free throw first. The American woman, Wallace, scored another goal. However, Chen Rongming, the main player of the Chinese team, refused to be outdone and returned the favor with a goal. In a short while, Chen Rongming scored two more goals in a row. Chen Jucai added to the excitement and made a shot. The score became 10 to 7. The Chinese team jumped to the forefront. However, the strength of the American women was always strong, and they returned a goal. Chen Rongming then chased closely with a goal. As the first half was about to end, the American Bausek made another shot. Thus, the first half ended with a score of 13 to 12. The Chinese team was slightly defeated.</p>
<p>After changing sides, the Chinese team became even more brilliant. Chen Rongming scored first. Then, the American woman returned a goal. After that, Chen Rongming's shot was successful again. At this time, the fight was the most intense and was the key to victory or defeat. Therefore, both sides tried their best to compete. Thus, an equal score of 21 to 20 was reached. After a break, Ren Shu and Chen Jucai each scored a goal. At the end of the third quarter, the Chinese team turned defeat into victory with a score of 25 to 21. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, Chen Rongming got the ball under the basket, turned around and shot, succeeding with ease. Then, Chen Jucai scored another goal. The American women struggled for a long time before scoring a goal and then a free throw. However, time ran out, and the Chinese team won. The score was 29 to 24.</p>

<p>| 42 to 29 |</p>
<p>The great battle began. Like dragons fighting tigers, the two sides fought fiercely. Because of the fouls of Hu Zhengqu and Lu Zhongen, the American team got two free throws first. Then, Feng Nianhua got Qian Jingyong's assistance and scored a goal. The two sides struggled for a long time. Feng Nianhua got another ball under the basket. Then, Chen Xianglong made a shot. Shortly after, Chen Zongqi replaced Hu Zhengqu. The foreign soldiers became even more fierce. Later, Sun Baoqing replaced Chen Zongqi, but still could not succeed. After a long struggle, Qian Jingyong scored another goal, finally achieving an equal score of 12 to 12. After that, Feng Nianhua scored another goal, and Chen Xianglong also made a free throw. However, the opponent was not easy to conquer, and they scored five consecutive points. At this time, the comparison was 17 to 15. The first half ended. After changing sides, the Chinese athletes tried to recover, but although there were many good opportunities, they were repeatedly missed. Instead, the opponent succeeded. In addition, the audience kept shouting at the referees. The American team took advantage of this to make one advance after another, like a hot knife through butter. The score became more and more distant. Later, although Chen Xianglong scored two goals in a row, the momentum changed for a while. However, the opportunity was too late, and the decline could not be reversed. In the last five minutes, the Chinese team was at a loss and was defeated by a score of 29 to 42. However, only the Chinese and American teams participated in the men's competition. Therefore, a three-game, two-win system is used. If they can win the next game, there will still be a chance to compete with the American team for the championship.</p>

<p>Hoping young people will work hard to improve.</p>
<p>| The puppet state's participation will definitely not be deceived by propaganda |</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 10th) Wang Zhengting arrived in Beijing on the 10th and talked about how the standard for our country's attendance at the Far Eastern Games is the best performance at last year's National Games. People such as Liu Changchun, Qian Hangsu, Yang Xiuqiong, Jin Zhongkang, and Fu Baolu are all qualified to be selected. It is planned to have 120 to 170 people. Most of our country's athletes rely on students, and there are very few amateurs. In terms of performance, long-distance running is inferior to the Philippines and short-distance running is inferior to Japan. He deeply hopes that young people will work hard to improve. He continued, the issue of Japan instigating the puppet state to participate deserves special attention. However, China has China's righteous position and will never be deceived by Japan's propaganda.</p>

Youyou took the offensive, but the Navy resisted stubbornly, refusing to show weakness at all. Finally, in the last four minutes, Sun Tietui scored, and the Navy surrendered. The wind was very strong, making it difficult to attack and defend. In the ten minutes after the game, Youyou launched a full-scale attack.</p>
<p>Sun Tietui was in the center, rushing all the way, and passed quickly to Zhong Yongsen in front of the goal. Xiao Zhong took the opportunity to flick the ball, opening the scoring first. Unexpectedly, the Navy counterattacked. Five minutes later, Brandt attacked on the left and also scored. The first half ended in a 1 to 1 tie. In the second half, Youyou attacked repeatedly but could not score. As the game was about to end, Sun Tietui got angry, raised his foot, and made the score 2 to 1, determining the victory.</p>

<p>Jianan and Shakel played a Western League Group A soccer match yesterday afternoon in the strong wind, slanting rain, and chilly weather at the China Baseball Field. There were few spectators, with the feeling of a deserted scene. It was found that Jianan had once been defeated by the Russians 10 to 4. This time, they met again and originally planned to take revenge. The entire team was invigorated, but unfortunately, they were unlucky. Every time they attacked the goal, the forwards hesitated, causing many good opportunities to be missed. The opponent's attacks were also extremely fierce. Fortunately, the defenders Xu Gu and Lai resisted effectively. The game was deadlocked for 80 minutes without any progress. After that, Shakel became more and more powerful. Ke Su Bo and the three forwards colluded with each other and advanced circuitously. Huo Wotufu took the opportunity to kick the ball accurately, opening the scoring. Without any reason, Huo rode alone from the western frontier, unexpectedly raided the forbidden area, and broke through Jianan's gate again. After that, although Jianan tried hard to counterattack urgently, the time was up, and there was no chance to turn the tables. As a result, Jianan was defeated by Shakel 2 to 0 for the second time.</p>

<p>— Peng Xiang</p>
<p>Little friends: Do you know? There are four types of essays: narrative, expository, descriptive, and argumentative. Narrative and expository are relatively easy, while descriptive and argumentative are more difficult. Currently, the essay topics given by your teachers in school can be said to require you to write only the first and second types of essays mentioned above.</p>
<p>What is a narrative essay? A narrative essay is an essay that narrates an event. For example, writing a story or recording the work you do in a day are all this type of essay. What is an expository essay? An expository essay is an essay that explains something. For example, if your teacher gives you a topic called "Dog," you would write about what a dog looks like, what its temperament is, etc. This is an expository essay.</p>
<p>Descriptive and argumentative essays are not needed by you now, so I won't talk about them.</p>
<p>The most important thing in a narrative essay is to have order, writing down each thing in chronological order, and never making a mess of it. In an expository essay, it is necessary to have a clear understanding, to clearly recognize why this thing is different from other things, and what characteristics it has itself, etc. Little friends: If you do it according to the above method, your essays will definitely make great progress in the near future.</p>

<p>— Liu Zhongxi</p>
<p>At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, there appeared a strange young man named Wang Mian, who lived in a village in Zhuji County, Shaoxing Prefecture, Zhejiang Province. His father died when he was seven years old. His mother made a living by doing needlework, and the money she earned was used to support him to study in the village school. Later, because she did not have enough money to continue supporting him to study in the village school, she sent him to a neighbor's house to help them herd cattle, for which he could earn a few pennies a month. He saved the money he earned each month, and when he had free time, he would sneak into the village school to buy a few books to read. He often herded cattle by the Qiliu Lake not far from the village.</p>
<p>One day, he led the cattle to the side of a willow tree, and he himself lay down under the shade of the willow tree to read. Suddenly, a heavy rain passed by, and the raindrops on the lotus leaves in the lake rolled around like pearls. The blood-red sun had just emerged from the dark clouds, shining all over the lake in red. The willow trees by the lake all looked like they had been washed. The mountain streams by the lake trickled into the lake.</p>
<p>Seeing such a beautiful scene, he thought of the ancient saying "man in a painting." He thought, "It's a pity I can't paint, and can't paint such a beautiful scene." From then on, he was determined to learn to paint. He used his savings to buy painting supplies. Later, when he was seventeen or eighteen years old, everyone in Zhuji County knew that he was a master at painting boneless flowers.</p>

<p>— Xue Fan</p>
<p>The school bell rang. I walked into the classroom. All the little brothers and sisters stood up, their dark eyes watching me.</p>
<p>I said: Today, everyone try to make a few short sentences. The topic is "My Mother." Each of you just needs to say a few sentences about your own mother.</p>
<p>The children all widened their eyes. Some smiled with their mouths open, some tilted their heads to think. They looked like they were whispering and discussing something important. Xu Jialin suddenly stood up:</p>
<p>"Teacher! I can do it, but I have the idea, but I can't write the sentences."</p>
<p>"What idea do you have?"</p>
<p>"I want to write: My mother only loves to play cards; but I can't write the word 'cards.'" After Xu Jialin finished speaking, all the children in the class laughed.</p>
<p>"Teacher! I also have an idea, but I can't write the sentences." Xue Xiaoling also stood up.</p>
<p>"Speak!"</p>
<p>"My mother has a fur coat, but I only have a small cotton-padded jacket!"</p>
<p>"Teacher! I have one too!" "Teacher! I want to say my idea too!" Immediately, there was a commotion in the classroom.</p>
<p>"Quiet! Quiet!" I pointed to the first seat in the third row. "Zhou Tiancheng, you speak first!"</p>
<p>The children all stared at Zhou Tiancheng with envious eyes, seeing that he had won the right to speak first.</p>
<p>Zhou Dacheng showed a smug smile: "When my mother has delicious chocolate candy, she always gives my younger sister more than me. What's the reason for this?"</p>
<p>I then asked Xu Xueshi next to Zhou Tiancheng: "Can you answer the reason Zhou Dacheng just asked?"</p>
<p>"I think Zhou Dacheng's mother gives her younger sister more because she is younger, is that right?"</p>
<p>"That's right." I replied.</p>
<p>I asked a few more students in turn. The children's answers were all very interesting. Because the text of this publication should not be too long, I will not write them down.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Failure and Success <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— He Yiding</p>
<p>Sixth Grade, Jiangyin Private Fuyan School</p>
<p>In this world, no matter what you do, in the beginning, there is always "failure" and "frustration," but in the end, you will always succeed.</p>
<p>When I was in the first grade of Group A five years ago, I read a Chinese text whose content was: England and Scotland were at war with King Robert the Bruce. Robert the Bruce was outnumbered and defeated six times in a row. At this time, all the good generals were dead, and Robert the Bruce was lying alone in a thatched cottage in the countryside. He saw a spider spinning a web, which also failed six times, but succeeded on the seventh try. Robert the Bruce was greatly moved by this situation. He summoned his old troops again and fought England again, and thus regained Scotland. From this incident, it can be seen that for all matters, big or small, as long as you are not discouraged after failure and are willing to work hard again, you will surely succeed.</p>
<p>In school, we have monthly exams in each subject. After failing, we always think that we will not be able to advance to the next grade, and we become discouraged and do not study hard. This is absolutely wrong. Because we have failed, we should work harder, and not stop until we pass. This is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Not only should we work hard when we fail, but we should also work hard when we pass. We must never be arrogant because we have succeeded. Then, our studies can progress even more.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Progress in Methods of Making Fire <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>From Ancient Times to the 19th Century</p>
<p>Among animals, only humans are able to make fire. With fire, we can cook food, light lamps, and it is not an exaggeration to say that humans have made progress compared to other animals because they obtained the method of making fire. From ancient times to the 19th century, for thousands of years, the methods humans used to make fire were initially no more than four types: "drilling," "sawing," "planing," and "striking." Later, matches appeared. The picture on the right shows the progress of these methods. (1) is the oldest method of making fire, called "hand drill." (2) is a "rope drill," which requires two people to work together. (3) is a "mouth drill." (4) is a "pump drill." The above four types all use two pieces of wood, one vertical and one horizontal, and generate heat through continuous friction, causing the shavings to burn and then fanning them into flames. (5) and (6) are both "fire-starting saws," which saw a bamboo strip sharpened into a knife edge back and forth on another bamboo strip, causing the shavings to ignite spontaneously, falling into the tinder, and then fanning them into flames. (7) is a "fire-starting plane," which planes a wooden stick back and forth in the groove of another piece of wood, gathering the shavings together. Because of the continuous friction, heat is generated, and the shavings burn. (8) is a "fire-starting gun," which has a piston inside a cylinder that moves up and down quickly. The compression of the air generates heat sufficient to ignite the tinder. (9) is pyrite and flint. (10) is a tinderbox. The above two types are both methods of making fire by "striking," striking two pieces of mineral against each other to create sparks, thereby making fire. (11) About one hundred and fifty years ago, sulfur matches were discovered, but the matches at that time had to be dipped in a burning tinderbox to produce flames. Matches that could produce fire by friction on their own, like modern matches, were not invented until 1826.</p>

<p>(1) Socks</p>
<p>One morning, Hui'er put on the wrong socks. She wore a white sock on one foot and a black sock on the other.</p>
<p>So her mother told her, "Hui'er, look at yourself. You've put on the wrong socks. Hurry up and change them."</p>
<p>Hui'er began to stare blankly, standing there in a daze. Then she laughed loudly and immediately walked into the bedroom.</p>
<p>After a moment, Hui'er came out, holding the socks in her hand, and said, "Mom, how can I change them? This pair is also one black and one white!"</p>
<p>(2) Rainy Day</p>
<p>It was raining. Hui'er and Min'er were walking home from school. The two of them were walking in the heavy rain all the way.</p>
<p>Hui'er said, "Brother Min, hurry up. When we get home, everything will be fine. Mom is anxiously waiting for us."</p>
<p>Min'er said, "Sister Hui, you tell me to walk faster, but what's the use of walking faster? Isn't it still raining up ahead?"</p>
<p>(3) Finger</p>
<p>Ming'er had an extra finger on one hand. Someone said, "Ming'er, how did you get this finger?" Ming'er said, "It's made of ivory. My grandmother put it on for me." Someone said, "Well, what's the use of this finger?" Ming'er said, "It's best for picking ears!"</p>
<h3 id="e227">Number Recognition Game <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Children feel that arithmetic is a bit difficult. As long as they practice more, it is not difficult to overcome. As the saying goes, "practice makes perfect," which is what it means. Below, I will introduce a game to practice number recognition and fluency, to help children become proficient in mental arithmetic. During leisure time, invite a few children to play together, and it will be very interesting.</p>
<p>At least four people must participate in the game, and it is best if the number of people is not a multiple of three. When playing the game, everyone sits in a circle. The location of the game can be indoors or outdoors.</p>
<p>The method of the game is very simple. Start with anyone, and take turns counting numbers to the right: "One, two, three, four, five, six, : : :" One person counts one number, and the cycle continues. However, the person who counts the number "three" cannot say the number out loud. They can only clap on the table or the ground. For the following numbers "six," "nine," "twelve," "fifteen," : : : (all multiples of three, six, and nine), they do not need to count, but just clap their hands. For example, A counts one, B counts two, C doesn't count (claps once), D then counts four, E counts five, F doesn't count (claps once), G counts seven, H counts eight, I claps: : : This continues in a cycle. If someone who shouldn't count forgets to clap and says the number out loud, they have violated the rules. If someone who should count doesn't count and claps, it is also considered a violation of the rules. The punishment for violating the rules can be decided by the people participating in the game, but according to the results of my experiment with children, the first mistake is punished by standing up, the second violation is punished by running one lap around the outside of the game circle, and the third is punished by singing a song or telling a story. This method of punishment is more appropriate.</p>
<p>For younger children, you can use odd or even numbers to clap, such as clapping on even numbers or clapping on odd numbers. For older children, you can change to clapping on multiples of four, seven, : : : etc. Change as needed in application!</p>

<p>In winter, the dew on the weeds froze into frost. The frost stung the faces of the weeds. The frost prevented the weeds from growing upwards. The weeds felt great pain.</p>
<p>The brave weed A roared:</p>
<p>"Down with the imperialist frost! Drive away the evil frost!"</p>
<p>Countless weeds also learned to shout loudly.</p>
<p>Weed B inserted a cold question:</p>
<p>"What power can we use to defeat the frost?"</p>
<p>The weeds shouting slogans were silent.</p>
<p>Weed B then offered an opinion: "Under the oppression of the frost's violence, our only solution is to endure humiliation and seek revenge. We will put all our nutrients into our roots to strengthen our strength. When spring comes, we will seize the opportunity to drive away the frost and fight for our freedom. Shouting slogans is in vain. This is our revenge plan."</p>
<p>The weeds listened. The leaves turned yellow. The nutrients in the leaves were all put into the roots. They were all preparing to endure humiliation and seek revenge.</p>

<p>It is said that this year is the "Year of the Dog," and the children born this year should belong to the dog sign.</p>
<p>In a certain school, a student surnamed Zhang, who is twelve years old this year, is very gluttonous. When eating at the same table, he always eats more than his share. Everyone at the table dislikes him very much.</p>
<p>Once, there was a dinner party. Zhang ate greedily, reverting to his old habits. Li, who was sitting at the same table, knew that he belonged to the dog sign. He deliberately asked him, "May I ask what your honorable age belongs to?"</p>
<p>"Dog," Zhang replied.</p>
<p>"That's good," Li continued, "If you belonged to the tiger, everyone at our table would be eaten by you."</p>
<p>Zhang's face turned red with shame after hearing this.</p>

<p>Dad asked me what kind of person I wanted to be. "Someone with hands and feet!" I replied. "Silly child! Who doesn't have hands and feet!" Dad laughed.</p>
<p>"Yes, everyone has hands and feet," I said. "But, if you have hands and don't use them, and have feet and don't move them, won't you become a useless person who has no hands or feet? We are born with two hands to use, and we are born with two feet to move. I want to use my hands to do what I should do; I want to move my feet to walk the path I should walk—until my blood runs dry and my limbs wither!"</p>
<p>"My good child! : : :" A smile appeared in the corner of Dad's eyes, and a right hand that had tasted the bitterness of the world was messing up my hair.</p>

<p>"Tang, tang"! A monkey show is being performed on the northeast open ground of the Hua family. Beating the gong, beating the drum, the monkey showman holds the iron chain of the performing monkey in one hand, and dances the whip in the other, leading the monkey from east to west, here to there, singing loudly in his mouth:</p>
<p>"The performance is a set, the monkey wears a top hat for the show."</p>
<p>The monkey actually puts on a red-tasseled hat, jumping and scurrying, causing a slight laugh from the surrounding audience.</p>
<p>He makes the monkey play tricks such as riding on the back of a sheep, jumping through iron hoops, somersaulting, and climbing high poles. Although the monkey is very unwilling in its heart, when it sees the whip in his hand, it dares not disobey. Finally, the monkey is mechanically led back to the corner of the ground, and the broken box is opened. The monkey showman sings loudly again:</p>
<p>"The tricks are new again, seeing the monkey wearing a dragon robe"!</p>
<p>A spectator impatiently said: "Isn't this the old trick that was played on the wasteland of the Han family on the banks of the Yalu River before? What's the point of watching it?"</p>

<p>Since the Qianye Market started trading with the abolition of the lunar calendar and the new transactions, only morning transactions are done every day, and the noon market is closed according to the rules, because there is no major entry or exit in the market, so there is no need for a noon market. Now all industries have mostly invigorated and started, so noon market trading has already started yesterday. However, the excess of the Toucun, the Yang Chai finally borrowed white, both morning and noon markets uniformly borrowed white without interest, that is, the Hua Tou market situation is also Hua white without adding water, and the transfer ticket transactions seem to be gradually increasing, the morning market transfer has more than 4.2 million, the new transactions more than 300,000, the noon market transactions more than 400,000, the small general meeting transaction more than 600,000, bank collection and delivery, foreign bank collection and delivery ticket funds more than 1.6 million, various cargo exchange mortgages, telegrams and other collection and delivery funds more than 6.1 million, the reason is that there are many imported goods on that day, so there are more mortgage exchanges and telegram exchange advances, etc., warehousing 500,000, Huashang Bank collection and delivery ticket funds more than 2.1 million, various cargo exchange tax mortgages and other collection and delivery funds 5.34 million, warehousing 300,000, Japanese Bank collection and delivery ticket funds more than 1.5 million, various cargo exchange miscellaneous funds collection and delivery more than 3.4 million, warehousing 600,000, Qianzhuang Yang Gong Dan collection and delivery more than 34 million, Yang Hua Tou funds collection and delivery more than 4.3 million, various remittance funds more than 500,000, cash collection 340,000, Yang mortgage funds transactions more than 900,000, banknote entry and exit more than 2.3 million, passenger source 200,000, stomach removal 150,000,</p>

<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan Xiaoyang, due to sluggish sales and eager supply, resulted in a sharp drop in prices in the morning market, down 10 yuan from the previous day, to 820 yuan. The morning and noon markets were the same, and transactions were made, 6,000 Jiao in the morning market, and 4,000 Jiao in the noon market. Guangdong Xiaoyang also fell more than 2 yuan, with the morning market being 761 yuan and 5 Jiao, and the noon market being 760 yuan and 4 Jiao.

<p>｜Only Fluctuations of Five Fen and Two Jiao｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Huashang Securities Exchange's market still showed no signs of improvement, and trading became increasingly quiet. There were very few entries and exits between large households, and the stagnation of the situation was even more severe than before. The public bond market has been in a circling situation for many days, and the persistence of both longs and shorts has not waned for a long time, which is rarely seen in recent times. However, if this continues, the longer the brewing time, the deeper and greater the storm will be if there is a change in the environment. Both longs and shorts still hope to be prudent about it. The opening market yesterday morning was extremely quiet, with very few entries and exits by large households, and the market price fluctuated very little as a result, only five fen to one jiao of the board surface. The new customs duties fell slightly more due to the sale on the 15th, with the market price falling by three jiao to three jiao and a half. The situation in the second session became increasingly sluggish, and some types did not even see transactions. The two sessions in the noon market were slightly more lively, with a slight sale of Nos. 41 and 58, while Nos. 38 and 31 were both absorbed. However, the contention between prices was particularly strong, so the market price did not fluctuate much. The total daily market price resulted in both rises and falls, but only five fen to two jiao of fluctuations. The total number of transactions was 5,012,000 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot goods and 5,010,000 yuan in futures.

<p>The yarn market is trending up, and the situation is suddenly tight. Because the factory sees the sluggish sales of yarn, in order to maintain the factory's foundation, there is a motion to reduce the work, about 23% reduction. Therefore, the market's sentiment was greatly shaken, and the short side's activities made up for it, and the market rebounded. However, the general sellers still adhere to the principle of selling at a high price because the actual sales are not smooth. However, the bottom plate has dried up, and the manufacturers are struggling, so the market should not have a big drop.</p>

<p>The cotton market is trending weak, but the overseas cotton market is calm. Because the factory has a saying to reduce work, speculators are active in selling, and the market pressure is increasing. At the same time, another news is that due to the severe cold weather last year and the river was frozen, the source was lacking. Recently, the shipments from various parties have been relatively abundant, and the arrivals are becoming increasingly prosperous, so sellers are thinking low. The cotton market is softer than the yarn market.</p>

<p>New York, 9th telegram, reported that the cotton market in the week said that the progress of the Peng Hai plan could not arouse the needs of the public, which obviously disappointed the old longs. However, the current trend depends on the development of the case. Moreover, there are many relevant proposals in Washington, such as the management of raw cotton and the exchange of securities, the reciprocal tariffs, etc., which are enough to make people wait and see, and transactions are also restricted. The industry's purchases have not been active, and the cotton market is also quiet. The spot goods in the south have not been oppressed, but the supply is adequate, and the price increase is slightly more hedged. The recent rain and snow and the low temperature can be believed to promote the progress of the soil. The news of purchasing fertilizers and destroying weeds at the beginning of the week is particularly strong in agriculture, although the passage of the Peng Hai plan will modify its methods.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Grain North and South Rice Markets Arrival Source is Not Prosperous <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>The South is Obstructed by Wind and Rain :::::The North is Obstructed by Rivers</p>
<p>(沪南) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs in Hexia were blocked in the Minhang area due to the change of weather, wind and rain, and only a dozen or so ships (nearly 2,000 石) arrived. However, the sales 塲 in various places are more firm due to wind and rain, so the zero 躉 two stomachs are limited, and the sellers take the opportunity to hold on, which leads to the increase of several points of near corner in the market prices of Changbang Su Tong Nan Gang, etc., which are sold in the street shops. However, the purchasing intention of foreign gangs and the North Ocean gang is slightly inferior, only six or seven hundred packages. Qing Si and other late rice are opened in detail, and their numbers are all goods from Songjiang Xilian, etc., so the late rice market has not seen any improvement, only a hope of one or two fen. Du Yang Jian is still flat, and Bian Yuan follows the trend with several points. (沪北) Yesterday, the ships arriving from various places in Hexia were only six or seven because the Zhuangjia Jing轧 in the inner river was cut off. The market was high, and the price of white glutinous rice was stable. In addition to the medium and sub 加 corner, Yang Du Bu Jian early thin rice was also tight for several points. The prices of 白元 Yin Yuan 客jian were stable.</p>
<h3 id="e247">客秈 客化 Lively <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the 客秈 market, the shops in this street intermittently inquired, and the Fuzhou Gang office had a more active stomach. Other foreign gangs such as Mainland Shantou Wenzhou Ningbo also inquired, and the market gradually turned better. There were many medium and sub存 arriving, and the cargo owners were still eager to sell, so the market could not improve. Gao Mi was welcomed by all gangs, the origin price was high, and the dealers were unwilling to sell lightly, but there were still many stocks in the market, so the market could not rise, only the active activity of the Ben 客. The city opened 7,097 packages of various rice, and the market was not much different from the previous market, only the lower ones were tired for two or three points. Among them, 600 to 700 packages were taken away by Shantou Wenzhou Ningbo, more than 1,700 packages were taken away by this street, 320 packages were taken away by the Mainland Gang, and the rest were taken in by the Fuzhou Gang.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Flour Marked by Recent and Distant Gains <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening bell in the morning, all months showed an upward trend. With quotations from abroad, Chicago rose by four cents and Canada by about ten cents, so after the opening prices were announced, sentiment was already stable. Furthermore, although the government wheat had been entirely sold off, it was heard that various factories, due to special relationships, unanimously adhered to a policy of not selling, which made the market atmosphere more firm. It was thought that since the factories were not selling, the market could at least hold steady for a while, so short covering and speculative longs also bought in, and the market atmosphere felt good. By the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere continued to improve. The current month rose an additional cent due to northern buyers, while the forward months rose because of short covering and purchases by domestic factories, in addition to the morning gains. Based on the current trend, since the factories have made prior commitments, they are not likely to change their attitude for the time being, so temporary stability is expected. As a result, the current month rose two and a half cents compared to the previous day, April/May rose two cents, June rose two and a half cents, July rose two and seven and a half tenths of a cent, and August rose two and a half cents.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Futures and Spot Wheat Both Stable <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after the opening bells in the morning and afternoon, the months generally showed a stable trend. Although foreign wheat quotations did not fluctuate much, with Chicago up only four cents and Canada up ten cents, market participants had different observations due to the different situations of the near and distant months. The current month saw limited arrivals and good factory demand, so prices were naturally held up. Although a large batch of foreign wheat was sold for forward delivery, it all went to factories, and the exchange did not need to hedge, so sentiment remained stable as usual. As a result, the current month rose to one dollar and three cents, up two cents, July rose one cent, August rose two cents, and the remaining months had no comparison. The spot wheat market remained stable, with managed store wheat at $3.53, Bengbu wheat at $3.44, and Guzhen wheat at $3.49. Fuxin took 400 bags, Fufeng took 300 bags, and Huafeng took 400 bags.</p>

<p>No Sign of Prosperity</p>
<p>Spot transactions of miscellaneous grains were extremely sluggish, and market conditions generally trended downward. Since the beginning of the market rebound, there has been no sign of prosperity. Yesterday, the market opened with one truckload of Feihe yellow soybeans and one truckload of Yingzhou yellow soybeans, both of which were purchased by local dealers. 150 bags of Guide yellow soybeans were purchased by the Fuzhou traders. 300 bags of Chongming sand yellow soybeans were purchased by the Guangdong traders. 400 bags of Guide green soybeans were distributed by the Fuzhou inland traders. The remaining transactions included a total of 226 bags of peanuts, which were purchased by the Ningbo and local traders, 150 bags of white sesame seeds, which were purchased by the Little Luzon traders, and only 50 bags of black sesame seeds, which were purchased by the Shantou traders.</p>

<p>Small Yellow Croaker is the Mainstay</p>
<p>Recently, the encroachment of Japanese fishing vessels has become active again. Last month, the Japanese fishing vessel Man** Maru arrived, causing turmoil in the fish market. Unexpectedly, that same Man** Maru arrived again the day before yesterday (the 8th), with approximately 724 boxes of illegally caught fish, mostly small yellow croaker, weighing about 130 dan, with a total sales price of over $2,400. Yesterday (the 9th), the fishing vessel Daxin Maru also arrived, with a total catch of 800 boxes, also mostly small yellow croaker, with a total sales price of over $3,000. It is said that these fish are unloaded at the China Merchants Wharf at the 16th Pier and sold by Shenfeng and four other fish firms on consignment. As a result of this dumping of Japanese fish, domestic fishing vessels and the fresh fish industry are suffering huge losses. Even foreign ships arriving on the same day are said to have lost over $500 as a result.</p>

<p>||Export of Ji'li Silk Reduces by Half||</p>
<p>Every year, my country's Ji'li silk exports around 20,000 bales to Europe and the United States. In recent years, due to the encroachment of Japanese silk and poor reeling quality, exports have gradually decreased. From June 1st of last year to the end of February this year, Ji'li silk exports totaled only 2,373 bales. In the same period last year, a total of 4,741 bales were exported, a reduction of five-tenths.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the restoration of the upper Yangtze River shipping, Chuanhuang coarse silk is being transported to Shanghai in a steady stream. Yesterday, Bao Taihe Yellow Silk Store also received 26 pieces of Jinzhou yellow silk for sale in the store.</p>
<p>In the overseas raw silk market, sales of Chinese silk factories remain sluggish, and market prices are weak. The Shanghai port telegraph transfers are silent, and telegrams for yellow and white silk are rarely sent out. The future is again in a dire situation. Yesterday, only the Shanghai Silk Factory purchased ten bales of white factory silk, and Xinfu purchased ten bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk, with prices trending downwards.</p>

<p>The woolen fabric industry has always been divided into the Western-style clothing and the general clothing categories. Western-style materials often come with samples that are distributed to tailors, commonly known as the "Hongkou gang" sample shops. For many years, the general woolen fabric trade has been concentrated in the Qipanjie area, with shops selling single-width fabrics for Chinese-style clothing, marked with sizes and prices, for customers to browse and choose. The sample shops do not sell single-width fabrics, as they specialize in selling to Western-style tailors. Recently, with the arrival of the warm spring season, there has been a sudden increase in orders for Western-style clothing, which has led to a sharp increase in the sample business of these sample shops, especially in the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway areas, where purchases are most frequent.</p>

<p>Ribbed steel bars are currently selling for $109, which is slightly lower than before, but sales to customers have been developing. In recent days, over 120 tons have been sold. Transactions by local construction firms are normal. It is heard that there have not been many arrivals in recent days, so there is little expectation of change in the future.</p>

<p>The overseas fixed price for 200-pound company iron was reported to rise again yesterday, with each box selling for US$7.20, another ten cents higher than before. It is heard that there are no futures contracts available for the next month, so the Shanghai market is exceptionally strong, and factory demand has increased sharply. It is found that 1,400 to 1,500 boxes have been transacted in recent days. Old steel factory goods are selling for $28.50, and new steel factory goods are selling for $28. It is heard that the inventory is extremely low, and there are few arrivals, so the market atmosphere is exceptionally solid.</p>

<h3 id="e276">Two Pressing Issues for Modern Women <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Yun</p>
<p>| Freedom of Marriage and Freedom of Occupation | I don't think anyone can deny that the most pressing and difficult issues for modern young people, both male and female, are marriage and occupation. These two issues, while seemingly "old hat," are in fact increasingly important in human life. We only need to pay a little attention to the essays in newspapers and magazines depicting the pain and boredom of young people, and the frequent news of their suicides. If we trace the causes, it is either the pressure of life or the lack of freedom in marriage or broken love. Especially for women, the pain and oppression of these two issues in today's society are even more severe.</p>
<p>Let's start with marriage. "Freedom of marriage" naturally refers to marriage based on love. The words "love" are so fragrant, beautiful, and tender! The ecstatic "youthful love" is a supreme and beautiful art, a fundamental desire of every young man and woman, a natural voice from the depths of the human soul. But in this society where everything is commodified, such love-based marriages are rare. Because in this mercenary society, all issues revolve around money, and therefore the decision of relationships between the sexes is based on money, not love. People without money will not be loved. A very lively and beautiful young man, if he doesn't have the ability to support a wife, is often a loser in the field of love. It's the same for women. Those modern ladies in high society have money and time to go to dance halls, universities, and other entertainment venues, and have access to men, so they can fully enjoy the joy of being in love. Women in the middle class rarely have this opportunity. As for the countless working women in cities and the poor girls in the countryside, they often become prostitutes due to the pressure of life, and are forced to live a life of prostitution, satisfying the lust of all the men they don't want. This is their freedom. So, in today's society, so-called freedom of marriage is just a patent for the leisure class! Strictly speaking, it is only the freedom to exchange money and cosmetics!</p>
<p>As for women's occupations, although various sectors of society have opened up many avenues for women to earn a living, from government agencies to banks, post offices, telephones, and stores, they all employ female staff, but this can only accommodate a small number of women with relatively high social status and specialized skills. The most common occupations are working in factories and being elementary school teachers. Those who are elementary school teachers also live in a state of competition, panic, and instability. Those who are teachers in public schools often don't receive their salaries and experience financial panic. Those who are teachers in private schools are treated exceptionally poorly. An elementary school teacher works non-stop all day long and only earns ten to thirty yuan a month at most. As for the working women who work in factories, their miserable lives are even more unspeakable. They work twelve hours a day doing mechanical work in smoky, noisy factories, and the wages they earn are not enough to maintain even the minimum standard of living. Therefore, those female workers who cannot maintain their lives, and those women who simply cannot find work, are ultimately forced to become prostitutes, which is the most lowly free occupation for women. From this point of view, the so-called freedom of occupation for women, under the current social conditions, cannot be universally obtained by women, and even those who have already obtained it will only face another layer of oppression!</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the issue of marriage and occupation is not a simple and isolated issue, but is closely related to the entire society. However, due to the limited space of this article, I cannot fully elaborate on my personal views on this issue. I sincerely hope that male and female friends who are enthusiastic about women's issues will actively participate in the discussion and offer criticisms and corrections to this article.</p>
<h3 id="e277">The Issue of Private Prostitution <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Tong Hua</p>
<p>For the sake of international reputation, the Beijing authorities abolished public prostitution several years ago. However, while public prostitution was abolished, private prostitution is thriving. A special dispatch from Beijing in the Shen Bao on the 5th of this month stated:</p>
<p>"Private prostitution is rampant in Beijing, and according to a survey, there are as many as 3,000 prostitutes. Since the beginning of spring, the number of venereal disease patients in the Central Hospital has exceeded 100 per day, which is ten times more than any other disease. The situation is the same in the Gulou Hospital. Moreover, the number is increasing year by year, which is worrying."</p>
<p>The seriousness of the private prostitution issue lies not only in the annual increase in venereal diseases, but also in the large-scale collapse of the rural economy. Imperialism and feudal forces are destroying the Chinese countryside with a two-pronged approach, and the man-made natural disasters have exacerbated the bankruptcy of the rural economy. Water plants, leaves, tree bark, wheat seedlings, and Guanyin clay have become the food of farmers, and selling children has become their way to alleviate their plight. In Shaanxi, orphaned girls in their teens are sold for one or two yuan, but there are few takers. In the Quanzhou area of Zhejiang, a thirteen-year-old girl can be indentured for five years for only six yuan, and an eight-year-old girl can be sold for only twenty-two yuan, including the middleman's fee. Even a ten-year-old girl can only be sold for fifty yuan. In Guangdong, due to the collapse of the silk industry and the closure of silk factories, more than 200,000 female workers have lost their jobs. In order to survive, they have to flock to Guangzhou to work as maids or engage in secret prostitution. From the Northwest to the Southeast, where is it not a living hell? Nanjing, which once had the reputation of "golden powder" in history, is naturally no exception. We can vividly imagine what Jiangnan is like now by looking at the rice riots in Wuxi, the disturbances in Yangzhou, the decline of commerce in Suzhou, and the heavy taxes in Jiangning (the land tax is about one yuan per mu, accounting for a quarter of the annual harvest of the entire mu). Selling children is inevitable, and the increase in the number of women falling into the fire pit is inevitable.</p>
<p>At the same time, on the other hand, there is a need for the existence of prostitutes. As the capital, scholars seeking official positions and imposing military generals naturally flock here. These people, even though they have young wives at home who "regret teaching their husbands to seek titles," are far from home, and while embracing others, they are also moved by the beauty of Jinling, and naturally want to visit brothels. Under these circumstances, supply meets demand, and business is bound to flourish. The talk of benevolence and morality cannot withstand the scourging of life. Thus, the capital, on the surface, does not allow public prostitution, but private prostitution has finally become a matter of public knowledge.</p>
<p>The Beijing authorities have long known the truth of the matter and once advocated lifting the ban last year. For the sake of revenue and the fact that it has become an open secret, the authorities' move can be called straightforward. However, the Women's Association, in order to protect women's rights, rose up to oppose it and put forward the following relief measures:</p>
<p>(1) Representatives from party, government, military, police, and women's organizations should inspect daily. If private prostitutes are found, they should be taken into the relief home for accommodation.</p>
<p>(2) The government should expand the existing women's education and training centers in the relief home to serve as accommodation and relief centers.</p>
<p>(3) The party, government, military, police, and women's organizations should jointly establish a large-scale women's factory to accommodate them and teach them various crafts.</p>
<p>These measures, while seemingly reasonable on the surface, are actually scratching the surface. Under the dumping of goods by imperialism, factories in Shanghai and Tianjin are reducing their workforce or closing down. The original female workers have become unemployed. How can new large-scale women's factories be established? Under the total bankruptcy of the national economy, the surplus population is increasing day by day. Even if the education and training centers in various places are expanded, how can they accommodate this huge number of people? Moreover, the government is currently facing a financial deficit. How can these measures be realized?</p>
<p>The prostitution system is an inevitable phenomenon in the current society. Public and private prostitution are essentially the same. The only difference is whether it is recognized in law or not. Only by eliminating the fundamental contradictions of the current society can the prostitution system be eliminated. People fighting for women's rights! Grasp the center of the problem! Abandoning the root and pursuing the tip will only be in vain.</p>
<h3 id="e278">National Goods Women's Day <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Yao</p>
<p>Women's Day falls on China, quietly like white feathers floating on still water. Fortunately, there are a few women's associations that held joint gatherings: performing entertainment, promoting national goods, etc., which can be considered enlightened women in China, not falling behind international women.</p>
<p>In fact, in these years, full of wounds and wandering, after examining the internal and external situation, if we want to talk about making money for the public and private, the best thing is to promote national goods. We women, promoting national goods to save the country, even if we don't hold anything in common with international women on today's "March 8th," it's not necessarily a bad thing. However, it just so happens that "March 8th" Women's Day is also a national good. We should not be indifferent. Unfortunately, most people ignore it, thinking it is an imported product, afraid of causing trouble and remain silent. So today, it is so silent everywhere, it is really wrong! I am not as stubborn as Master Kang, advocating that the radio was also invented by Confucius; but "celebrating March 8th" is indeed a quintessence of women's philosophy, and now let's give a superficial lecture.</p>
<p>What is "March 8th"?</p>
<p>First, it is the eight characters, the year, month, day, and hour of a woman's birth, her eight characters. Once she enters someone else's door, she has gained "the one to rely on." So, marry a chicken and follow the chicken, marry a dog and follow the dog, and there is no need to have a wandering mind for life.</p>
<p>Second, it is the eight obediences. On top of obeying her father, husband, and son, she must also obey fate, the blue sky, the powerful, Yuan Shikai, and cars. There is no need to work hard to be independent.</p>
<p>Third, it is the eight segments. The head, chest, abdomen, hips, two hands, and two legs, these eight segments of the body, are exhibited for people to judge. Then her food, clothing, shelter, and transportation will naturally be what she wants, and she will be outstanding. There is no need to rely on vigorous movements to protect her.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned domestic women's "March 8th" does not contain any foreign goods. In this year of national goods, we can frankly and loudly call for it. And on this Women's Day of national goods, we can widely promote national goods, so that powerless women can also participate in the great cause of saving the country, and practice the skills of bearing heavy responsibilities and going far. This brings unlimited glory to the future of women.</p>
<p>As for the Women's Day of foreign goods, it contains ominous fighting characteristics: demanding what equality, what liberation, what raising the status of women, what improving the treatment of working women, etc., which may be said to be out of touch with the times for us. It is better to promote national goods and resist foreign goods. In the country, we cooperate and work together. When men are busy eliminating internal chaos and resisting for a long time, women work hard to promote the sale of national goods and economic construction. We fulfill our responsibility as a member of the public, and contribute to the national goods women's movement for ourselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, although there are commemorative days on the eighth, such as September 18th, January 28th, etc., for us, only this year's "March 8th" of the Women's National Goods Year is the most meaningful.</p>
<h3 id="e279">The Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan and Women <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— [blank]</p>
<p>(1) Women's Efforts for the Five-Year Plan: The success of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan has become an obvious fact.</p>
<p>However, its success is by no means like many other historical events, completed by men alone. In the process of the Five-Year Plan's victory, Soviet women have indeed shown a very important position. In the Soviet Union, all women who participate in production, whether they are urban workers or rural farmers, understand the tasks and significance of the Five-Year Plan. They feel the responsibility they should bear for all constructions, and they are moving forward vigorously.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Five-Year Plan, everyone was working hard to achieve the following goals:</p>
<p>(1) Who can relatively reduce the cost of production,</p>
<p>(2) Who can produce the best things,</p>
<p>(3) Who is working hard not to let the machine space. This competitive attitude expanded from individual workers to each other, between male and female workers, between workers and farmers, to each factory, each industrial sector, each city, and each rural area. In this competition, working women have done amazing work. For example, a working woman who usually could only produce 720 pieces a day, produced 954 pieces on the first day of the competition, and increased it to 1,020 pieces the next day.</p>
<p>The treatment they receive in their work is exactly the same as that of men. In the same labor, men and women receive the same wages, and there is no difference in terms of law.</p>
<p>(2) Progress of Women's Education: In the process of implementing the Five-Year Plan, Soviet women were able to undertake this great task, obviously they must have considerable knowledge and technical ability. However, in the Soviet Union, there were few people with education and technical ability, especially women. Therefore, at the beginning of the Five-Year Plan, the first thing to do was to overcome this shortcoming, especially the elimination of illiteracy. From 1927 to 1928, people in the Soviet Union who could read and write accounted for 53.9% of the total population. By 1932, the end of the Five-Year Plan, 82% of illiteracy had been overcome.</p>
<p>Of course, being able to read is not enough, so after Soviet women achieved the goal of being able to read and write, they further demanded to acquire specialized knowledge, in order to be able to work in factory management or agricultural management, and to engage in guidance. In 1929, there were 8,818 women studying in various industrial or agricultural specialized schools in the Soviet Union, of which 20% were working women. There were 4,784 women studying in industrial schools, of which 83% were working women. There were 4,975 women in vocational schools, of which 47% were the children of workers. There were 7,079 girls in factory-affiliated schools, of which 84% were the daughters of workers. Rural women have also made significant progress. In 1929, 21% of the students in Soviet higher education institutions were women who had previously engaged in agriculture or worked in their hometowns. Other labor specialized schools had 32% rural girls, technical schools had 20%, and various agricultural training schools also had 27%.</p>
<p>(3) Liberation of Family Life: In the process of rapid industrialization in the Soviet Union, working women, because they participated in this new type of production, of course there would be huge changes in their daily lives. This change is the new liberation that the Five-Year Plan bestowed on Soviet women. The first is to be freed from the pain of spending all their time raising children. In the Five-Year Plan, many nurseries were set up in all newly established labor areas, and near factories and workers' residences in cities. Many kindergartens and playgrounds were also set up in residential cooperatives or large residences for the purpose of accommodating children.</p>
<p>To reduce the burden on rural women, there are similar facilities in collective farms. All larger collective farms had more than a thousand nurseries by the end of the fifth year. In the nurseries, someone is taking care of the children diligently, and knowledgeable teachers are paying attention to the children's education. Everything in life is regular and appropriate, so that mothers working in factories can rest assured. There are also children's sections in the clubs, so that when mothers bring their children to the club, they will not be disturbed by the children and hinder their own rest and entertainment.</p>
<p>Of equal importance to the liberation of raising children is the establishment of many public kitchens. Many of these public kitchens are large kitchen factories equipped with modern technology. These kitchen factories are equipped with extremely clean and satisfactory dining rooms. At the end of the fifth year, there were 4,800 large kitchen factories, supplying meals to 20 million people.</p>
<p>All of these facilities, whether nurseries, kindergartens, children's sections, or public canteens, as well as public laundries, are all aimed at transferring the troubles of housework to society, so that women can be liberated from unproductive labor, engage in productive labor, and enter reading clubs to satisfy their burning desire to be educated.</p>
<p>In short, the success of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan is gradually liberating women from their historical inhuman lives and introducing them to the realm of freedom and equality.</p>
<h3 id="e280">Women in Rural Nantong <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Ming</p>
<p>If we want to understand the level of evolution of the people in a particular place, we can determine it by their lifestyle. Recently, there has been considerable attention in the country to the customs and habits of various regions. Even remote villages in the mountains and valleys are explored using every possible means. Perhaps this is not just a matter of impulsive interest, but a question concerning the future of the entire nation?</p>
<p>Nantong is known as a model county, with highly developed industry and commerce, hence the name "Shanghai of Jiangbei." However, what is their lifestyle like? Especially the women's? The women of the city will be described in another article. Now, I will first present various aspects of the women in rural Nantong below.</p>
<p>The women in rural Nantong are completely dominated by their environment. They have their own unique environment, which shapes their unique behaviors. What is their environment? "Bandits are numerous as hairs, the people have no means of living!" Coupled with their adherence to tradition, this forms their special way of life.</p>
<p>Habits: They are generally honest and simple, with peaceful temperaments. They dislike traveling far, are attached to their hometown, preferring a life of dullness rather than seeking development. Their vision is narrow, they perceive the world as too vast. Originally, crossing the Yangtze River shouldn't be a big deal, but they think, "A pregnant woman crossing the river is perilous!" Therefore, they only have "home" in their minds. They don't know what the nation and society are. They are very fond of their relatives.</p>
<p>Dress: Their dress is completely in the national style. They worship "three-inch golden lotuses." Every girl must bind her feet. Their feet are practically two bamboo sticks. When they walk, they sway and tilt, like toddlers learning to walk. Their clothing is very simple, made from cotton seeds to cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, all made directly by themselves without relying on external forces.</p>
<p>Marriage: Women never openly discuss matters between men and women. They are entirely controlled by "the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers." If they marry a good husband, they say their parents have foresight. If not, it is their predetermined fate. Everyone believes that "marriages are made three thousand years ago." If they are dissatisfied with their marriage, you won't hear it from their mouths. Even having such a thought is a sin. So, when a husband unfortunately dies young, they must sacrifice their youth and remain a widow. The same goes for those who are not yet married. There are also many marriages that are arranged before they are even born.</p>
<p>Beliefs: They are very religious, worshipping idols. Among all the gods, Guanyin Bodhisattva is the central object of devotion. Every year on the 19th day of the second, sixth, and tenth lunar months, gatherings are held. Women of all ages fast beforehand. On these days, they burn incense and candles, and kneel in worship, with hundreds of people gathering in groups. In addition to worship, they also murmur the Guanyin Sutra. --Seeking elixirs! Praying for children! Asking for fortunes! : : : Many problems that cannot be solved in ordinary times are brought to Guanyin for guidance.</p>
<p>Because Nantong has been plagued by bandits for several years, many innocent people have been killed by them. Fortunately, the banditry has calmed down somewhat, but the so-called government troops and defense corps still rob and kill as usual. This deep impression lingers in their minds. They see through life and death, considering them nothing. Thus, everyone tends to be more passive, believing in Buddhism, reciting "Namo Amitabha" morning and night, hoping that after suffering in this world, they can go to the Western Paradise to enjoy bliss, or be reborn into a good family.</p>
<p>Work: Women absolutely manage all household affairs. Cooking and laundry are their compulsory subjects, as well as household arrangement, and sewing for their children: : : all are their duties. In addition to doing housework, they also work in the fields, helping the men.</p>
<p>Status: They absolutely obey their husbands. However, there is no so-called suppression on the husband's part. There is also a phenomenon where husbands obey their wives in household matters, while wives obey their husbands in matters outside the household. This is a method of division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>As for finances, they are entirely in the hands of men. They have no possibility of participating in social affairs.</p>
<p>Due to limited space, the details of the rural women in Nantong must be left at this point. After reading this, readers will definitely doubt the name of the model county, right? --The division between city and countryside lies here.</p>

<h3 id="e281">(I) Letter <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of the Women's Garden section of the February 18th issue, in "A Woman's Life," there is a section on children suffering from pinworms. My household has a girl who is six years old and quite healthy. Every evening, she cries out that her anus is in pain, which I suspect is due to this strange ailment. This has been going on for about four months. More than a month ago, I went to Wuzhou Pharmacy and bought a bottle of Jianji Candy. After eating several pieces, a worm like a chopstick was excreted, but recently the anal pain has greatly reduced. I went to the hospital for a diagnosis, but they couldn't find anything wrong, and it cannot be completely cured. If you have a good remedy, please advise and I will be grateful. Respectfully, and wishing the editor of the Women's Garden section good health.</p>

<p>— Lan Bishan</p>
<p>A worm like a chopstick excreted after taking Jianji Candy is a roundworm, not a pinworm. Adult pinworms usually live in the rectum. If you want to get rid of them, Jianji Candy can be used. However, the worms are small, and ordinary people often don't pay attention and cannot find them in the stool. The letter says, "The child cries out that her anus is in pain, which I suspect is itchy." But that's just a guess. Whether it's caused by pinworms is still a question. To determine if she has pinworms, you only need to use a microscope to check her stool for worm eggs, which is very easy. To determine whether her anus is in pain or itchy, there should also be a method, but I can only give a clear answer after an examination.</p>

<p>Three, The Age of Yearning</p>
<p>After a girl's first menstruation, great changes occur in her body. The first menstruation is a symbol of the completion of a girl's reproductive system.</p>
<p>When a girl reaches this period, her skin gradually becomes soft, her hair shiny, her cheeks flushed, and her whole body becomes exceptionally rich and beautiful. This is all caused by the endocrine secretions circulating in the body from the reproductive glands.</p>
<p>At this time, not only do changes occur in a girl's body, but there are also unusual signs in her emotions.</p>
<p>During this period, she often gazes at her own image in the mirror, which is the first step towards heterosexual love. She gazes at her own image in the mirror as if it were the object of her love. But she unconsciously seeks a real object of love.</p>
<p>A certain Western painter once painted a picture of a girl kissing her own image in the mirror, which clearly symbolizes a kind of love consciousness and immediately evokes feelings of love. This impulse to love oneself is called the Narcissus phenomenon, named after the story of the beautiful youth Narcissus in ancient Greek mythology who fell in love with his own reflection in the water.</p>
<p>The rising demand for love in a girl's blood cannot be satisfied with her own image in the mirror, so she turns to love of the same or opposite sex. Homosexual love is more likely to occur in factories or school dormitories. This is a pathological condition, and if properly guided, it can enhance a girl's emotions and cultivate her appreciation of beauty. Conversely, it can be quite harmful. As a result of homosexual love, she may not be able to marry a healthy person of the opposite sex, or she may dislike marriage and live a life of perverted love. There are also cases where it disappears naturally after having a lover or getting married. This kind of perverted life and love is harmful and useless. It is necessary for parents and teachers to advise and guide them well.</p>

<h3 id="e284">A Word to My Fellow Amateur Students <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Pu</p>
<p>Everyone feels depressed these days, and most people don't have a way to relieve their depression. Is it impossible to relieve depression? That may not be the case. Although it's really not easy to solve depression before society stabilizes, if we can thoroughly understand the future direction of society and think about how individuals should adapt to the current society, it's not absolutely impossible to find a solution. Because depression arises from our lack of ways to adapt to the environment. If we have a way, depression can be reduced. Reading is one way we currently think can solve this depression, because although we can feel the state of our environment in daily life, it is unsystematic, trivial, vague, and obscure. If we can further use scientific methods to study the causal laws of objective phenomena, we will be able to understand the environment very thoroughly and clearly. So what we mean by reading is not rote memorization, but using a scientific spirit to study reality. Our purpose in reading is not to kill time, let alone to have others praise us, but to enable us to adapt to or transform the environment, rather than being bound and dominated by the environment.</p>
<p>This article is aimed at general amateur students. The above paragraph is written with this in mind, because I have recently been working at an amateur school and have found that at the beginning of the semester, there are a lot of people in each class, usually five or sixty people in each class, but later the number slowly decreases. By the end of the semester, there are often only twenty or thirty people, or even ten or so people left. This situation is especially common in foreign language classes. I am very surprised by this situation. Why do they drop out halfway? Later, after our investigation and repeated conversations with them, we learned that there are roughly three reasons why they drop out halfway:</p>
<p>(1) The teacher's teaching method is not good;</p>
<p>(2) The readers are all employed, and due to fatigue or busyness in their spare time, they often have to miss classes. Later, because they missed too many classes, they couldn't catch up, so they simply stopped reading;</p>
<p>(3) At first, they had a high interest and desire to read, but after reading for a few weeks or two months, they felt that reading was not an easy task and that it required a considerable amount of time to be effective, so they became discouraged and stopped reading. Looking at the above three reasons, in addition to the first one, which is not a problem and should be the responsibility of the school (such as the schools run by our organization now, our teachers are either successful in the past or are hired after careful consideration), the second and third items are not shortcomings in our teaching, but that readers do not have a thorough understanding of reading, so they lack perseverance and laziness. Therefore, I briefly discussed the "purpose of reading" above, hoping that readers will increase their courage to read. However, this cannot be discussed in detail here. Please refer to the previous "Reading Questions and Answers" in this newspaper, which has a more detailed discussion. (Such as "On Self-Study" on January 6th and 7th; "The Fundamental Problems of Reading" on January 27th, 28th, and 29th; "The Seriousness of Reading" on February 3rd, etc.)</p>
<p>We know that we all have a kind of inertia. We often decide to do something, and we also know that it is worthwhile and must be done, but later we often procrastinate and become lazy, putting that thing aside. This is a common problem of people and is not surprising, but if we can use reason and determination in everything we do, it is not impossible to overcome. So the first thing to do is not to be afraid of difficulties and not to be lazy. But while this is the most important point in doing things, objective difficulties can often affect the courage to do things. For example, if "missing a few classes makes it impossible to catch up later," then it is not a matter of determination to do things, but a problem of learning difficulties in fact. Therefore, after discussion, we want to try a method for this: we hope that the students in each class will organize a mutual aid reading group based on the spirit of mutual assistance. The method is for everyone to publicly choose a student with excellent grades and who is willing to serve everyone to help. Students who miss classes can ask them for help with the missed lessons and for help with things they don't understand. Because the teacher should be responsible for answering questions about academic matters, but the difficulties caused by missing classes should not be asked in class, which wastes the time of the whole class. If this method of mutual assistance is used, we deeply feel that those who are helped will certainly benefit a lot, but those who help can also take this opportunity to deepen the impression of the knowledge they have already acquired. Moreover, we know that sometimes we think we understand everything when we read, but when others question us, we become confused again. This often happens, so those who help can take this opportunity to check their reading and strive to achieve the purpose of teaching and learning from each other. In short, we think this method is very important and very beneficial, so we specifically propose it for discussion, for the reference of amateur students and those engaged in amateur education.</p>

<h3 id="e285">The Disasters of Sexual Desire <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Nu Lu</p>
<p>The ancients said: "Food and sex are human nature." And: "Food and sex, the great desires of man, exist." Thank God! Not only did he create man, but he also created "sex": not only did he make people think of food when hungry and drink when thirsty, but he also made people aware of youth and beauty and experience sexual hunger and thirst when they reach a certain age. What makes people especially grateful is that God's rewards and punishments are clear, and his grace and power are both present. They are all God's children, but he allows some to obtain the highest degree of satisfaction of food and sex without labor, while others have to work hard, live frugally, and excessively restrain sexual desire and reproduction. Some people are even forced to sell their "sex" in exchange for "food." This is probably because the former are the favored children of heaven, who should receive heavenly gifts; the latter are deeply sinful and should be condemned by heaven!</p>
<p>Now let's put aside the problem of "food" and only talk about my personal "sex" life over the past year.</p>
<p>Many people regard "sex" as an obscene matter. Therefore, in order to avoid the suspicion of "pandering to lust," I have tried my best to use a solemn tone when writing this article.</p>
<p>My wife and I are both salaried workers; my monthly salary is twenty yuan, and my wife can earn fifteen yuan per month. But we both have to take care of our own food and lodging. And there is no fixed property at home, so life can only barely get by. What is barely satisfactory is that we have been married for a year and still don't have a child, which is what we often consider to be fortunate.</p>
<p>My wife is a strange person. Like some women, she doesn't want to have children. She even gets anxious and upset when she hears other people's children crying. I have never seen her hug or kiss anyone's child. She doesn't like to do this, nor does she need to. In her mind, it seems that only "working" and "making money" are what she often thinks about. The tempering of life has gradually disappeared her innate motherhood!</p>
<p>As for me? I don't want to have children either. However, it's not that I don't want to have children, it's just that the environment doesn't allow me to have them, so I have to use all kinds of methods to excessively restrain sexual desire and reproduction.</p>
<p>I have thought about it this way: if my wife becomes pregnant and has a child, then she will not be able to work for at least two months. In this way, even if she doesn't resign from the company, the company will fire her. It is obviously impossible to get their permission to find someone to replace her or take a long vacation. She will only lose her job. You must know that life is a serious matter. Once she loses her job, it will be difficult to find another job after she recovers. Moreover, children need to be cared for and raised. Whether you pay to hire a nanny or the mother abandons her career to pursue "good mother and virtuous wife-ism," you will always have to add a large burden to your life and sacrifice a portion of your limited income. In this way, the so-called "little angel," once viewed through the eyes of us poor people, will immediately turn into a debt-collecting "living ghost." Just one of these "living ghosts" is enough to kill us, let alone hoping for "many sons and grandsons" and "a house full of children!"</p>
<p>Children are a disaster, sexual desire is the root of this disaster, and "poverty" is the root of the root of this disaster. On our first night of marriage, the terror of this disaster threatened us jealously, but fortunately, no evil was sown that night. Later, we adopted a separate bed system and paid attention to texts on contraception in newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>I don't know which newspaper I saw a piece of information saying that from the sixteenth day after the start of the previous menstruation to the start of the next menstruation, a total of thirteen days is the period of non-conception, and the risk is the least during this period. We adopted this method.</p>
<p>In fact, even during the so-called "non-conception period," we only dare to sleep together once a month at most, and we don't dare to be too unrestrained, lest we sow an evil seed. No wonder my wife once said to me like this:</p>
<p>"I don't know why, but I always feel like you are not my own man, but like I stole you."</p>
<p>My wife is right. A poor woman with a poor husband is the same as having none. Fortunately, we are not "well-fed," so we don't often "think of lust." The fatigue of working every day suppresses our physiological needs!</p>
<p>Although I am always so careful every time, in fact, I still can't relax. Every time I always suspect: "Will this time sow an evil seed? Is it really impossible to conceive during the non-conception period?" I worry and fret all day long, and unease occupies my whole heart, and I don't even have the energy to work. One act of indulgence is not worth the loss of ten or twenty days of worry and anxiety!</p>
<p>In the evening, when I come home from the company and meet my wife coming back, I often have to ask her like this: "Has your period come?" If the answer is "not yet," then I suspect even more: "Maybe the period hasn't arrived yet? Or has an evil seed been sown?" I am anxious and fretful, and my heart is even more uneasy. It seems that I have already seen the fetus wriggling in her belly, and the matter is even more serious. In this way, I always have to wait until one day she tells me: "It's here!" before I can completely relax.</p>
<p>Thank God! I still don't have a child. I hope I won't have one in the future. Under the current social system, for the sake of life, I would rather be an unfilial person who is "childless is the greatest filial impiety!"</p>
<h3 id="e286">A Spring-Filled Evening in a Room <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Da Ke</p>
<p>A big guy with a fierce face and a bamboo stick in his hand ordered him to untie his belt and socks and throw them on the ground. After searching him all over, he pushed him into the prison door, which was as thick as a lettuce bowl, and locked the door with a clang.</p>
<p>"Old Yu! Why are you here too?" Xiao Chen got up from the ground and asked with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>He glanced at Xiao Chen, gently replied to Xiao Chen, "How long have you been here?" and sat down in a corner directly opposite the toilet, holding his head in his hands and crouching on his knees, without saying a word.</p>
<p>"Dinner is served. Don't be anxious, new comrade. Eat something first." Hemp-faced A San approached him and said, while handing him a tin rice bowl and a pair of chopsticks.</p>
<p>He ignored him. He was thinking silently about when he left home today, his wife was holding the two-month-old child and lying on the bed, singing a monotonous lullaby. Maybe she was still hoping that he would borrow money to buy rice. Unconsciously, hot tears streamed down his face. Seeing his expression, Hemp-faced A San said, "Okay! Let's see how many meals you can skip. It's no use crying a river!" Xiao Chen added, "People who come in here for the first time are all anxious and can't eat anything. Let him sleep for a while."</p>
<p>He shook his head, indicating that he didn't want to sleep either, and asked Xiao Chen, "Is there a way to send a letter out?"</p>
<p>"It depends on the opportunity. If someone is released, you can ask them to take the letter. Otherwise, it will cost five yuan to ask the little sweeper to find a way to send it."</p>
<p>He was silent after hearing these words. He looked up at the wall, which was covered with many poems and couplets, and there was also a mimeographed declaration of someone, which was smeared with bedbug blood and could not be seen clearly. After they finished eating, they all sat together. Hemp-faced A San shouted, "Old Yu! Come and listen to the old comrade tell a story!" But he just nodded and still didn't come over to sit down. This so-called old comrade was about forty years old, with deep wrinkles on his forehead. At a glance, you could tell that he was a person who had experienced a lot of hardships. They forced this so-called old comrade to tell about his so-called underground life in recent years, but after he told it, he always had to add a little sentimental words. Hemp-faced A San was an illiterate boatman. After listening to the things the so-called old comrade told, he liked to raise one or two questions and discuss them with others. When he was happy, he was triumphant and noisy, until the person with a gun outside the door shouted, "Keep quiet!" Only then did he stop.</p>
<p>This room, which was less than one square zhang, had to sleep more than twenty people, so of course they were arranged horizontally and vertically, squeezed so tightly that their bones rattled. If someone got up in the middle of the night to urinate, it was impossible to squeeze back down after getting up. On his first night here, his heart ached, and he couldn't sleep at all. He lay in the corner, pulling a dirty, black corner of the quilt to cover his lower body, and fell into a hazy sleep around dawn. When the sound of the plane buzzed over the roof, Xiao Chen woke him up:</p>
<p>"Old Yu, it's eight o'clock. It's almost roll call. Get up!"</p>
<p>So he got up and sat down. Unexpectedly, he saw a four or five-year-old child in Room No. 4 across the way, seeing others eating fried dough sticks, and asking his father to buy him fried dough sticks too. He thought of his own eldest child at home again, who followed him to make hot water every morning and insisted on buying a fried dough stick or a crab shell. He didn't know what was going on today. Thinking of this, tears almost came out again.</p>
<p>After the roll call, many people were called away one after another. Some came back with tears in their eyes and moaning in their mouths, which was undoubtedly a result of being tortured. Sometimes men and women were lined up in a team and went out, and came back still lined up, which meant they were taking pictures and getting fingerprints. Sometimes men and women were lined up in a team and walked out with two ropes on both sides to block them, which meant they were being transferred to another agency. He stared at these people coming and going, lost in thought, until it was time for dinner, and Xiao Chen gave him a salted egg, and he ate a bowl of rice.</p>
<p>After finishing dinner, Hemp-faced A San stood alone inside the crack of the prison door, his eyes constantly looking out. In a moment, he danced and shouted, "Oh, here she comes! My dear, she's even prettier today!" At this time, the eyes of everyone in the room were focused outside the prison door. It turned out that every evening, this short-haired, slender girl of only eighteen or nineteen would come to each room to empty the chamber pots. When she unlocked the prison door and came inside, everyone became playful and smiling, and the room was filled with sounds of "Sister, I love you" and "My dear, why are you only here now?" It was as if all the sorrowful scenes of the earth had been transformed into a magnificent and colorful landscape by a spring breeze.</p>

<h3 id="e287">Is the Chicken Born from the Egg, or the Egg from the Chicken? <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— From Mu</p>
<p>When the question "Is the chicken born from the egg, or the egg from the chicken?" is raised, the so-called celebrities and scholars shake their heads and say, "This is a very mysterious question that can never be solved." In fact, the question itself is not mysterious; what is mysterious is the minds of these celebrities and scholars. Under their mysterious minds, it's chicken lays egg, egg lays chicken, egg lays chicken, chicken lays egg; as for who comes first, only heaven knows.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that a chicken is a living organism, and an egg is the embryo of that organism. According to biology, an embryo is formed and produced by an already existing organism. Therefore, our answer to the question is: the chicken lays the egg.</p>
<p>However, this is still a formal understanding; moreover, if one answers only formally in this way, it also carries a mysterious color. Because if one only says "chicken lays egg" without discussing the origin of the chicken, it is very easy for people to say in return "egg lays chicken," otherwise where did the chicken come from? Was it created by God? Mysterious!</p>
<p>Darwin tells us that all existing organisms have gradually evolved from a small life that appeared in the process of the formation of the universe. A chicken is a living organism, and its formation process certainly cannot violate the iron law of biological evolution; it is absolutely not created by God. According to general common sense, a chicken is a domestic fowl, and its predecessor must have been a wild bird, which gradually became tame after long-term domestication by humans. Due to the relationship of "use it or lose it," its wings gradually lost their flying function, and thus gradually formed the current shape of the chicken. As for this wild bird that formed the chicken, it was of course also evolved from a small organism that formed in the very beginning. Therefore, fundamentally speaking, the chicken is evolved from a certain organism that appeared in the formation process of the universe.</p>
<p>An egg is the embryo of an already existing chicken, or more precisely, it is the embryo of a chicken that has evolved along with the evolution of all living organisms. In this sense, only in this consciousness can we say that the already existing chicken comes first, and then the egg, as the embryo of the chicken, comes later; it is the chicken that lays the egg, not the egg that lays the chicken.</p>
<p>Here, some people may ask: the so-called wild bird, the predecessor of the chicken, must also be laid by an egg. Then, can't we say that the chicken is laid by an egg? This is easy to answer. First, the egg that produces the wild bird, the predecessor of the chicken, is not a chicken egg; second, as mentioned above, there must first be an organism, and then there will be the embryo of the organism. Similarly, there must first be a wild bird, and then there will be the egg of the wild bird as its embryo. Therefore, even for wild birds, there must first be the body, and then the egg as its embryo; thus, third, there is still the chicken first, and then the egg. If we still want to pursue the ultimate, to trace the origin of primitive organisms from the relationship between chicken and egg, and the relationship between wild bird and wild bird egg, then we can only attribute it to the matter in motion. In this way, the problem is not only not mysterious at all, but can also be solved scientifically.</p>

<h3 id="e288">The Emperor's Cook and the Ming Dynasty's Soup <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Lixia</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence　　Anyone who has lived in Beiping for a few years will always have a deep impression of this gray ancient capital in their minds. Because, people here can not only see a peaceful and tranquil living environment; at the same time, because Beiping is a historically ancient capital, people here can also understand the remnants of past China and past Eastern culture from the environment!</p>
<p>In recent decades, although Western civilization has been constantly impacting this ancient city, we can still find traces of ancient culture everywhere in this declining city.</p>
<p>For example, the majestic imperial palace, the beautiful gardens, the imperial river with lotus flowers blooming in May, and the solemn ancestral temple with pine and cypress trees—which of these would not give people a deep impression? Which of these would not make people trace the past of China? ｜｜｜Not only these, but even in some small aspects of diet and daily life, it is the same.</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, I can give you some simple facts. For example, in terms of diet.</p>
<p>Many restaurants in Beiping often have a very long history, among which the most famous are Dongxinglou and Shaguoju.</p>
<p>Dongxinglou is located on the north side of Dong'anmen Street in the east of the city. It is said that it has been open since the Qing Dynasty and has been around for hundreds of years. The exterior of this restaurant is very old, with low bungalows and a gray-black surface. The architecture is naturally in the old style of hundreds of years ago. The light is not good, and the air is not circulating. All the furnishings inside are some mahogany square tables, flat beds, and chairs and stools. It is said that the cooks here are former imperial cooks, and the current chef is the one who used to cook for Xuantong. Because of this relationship, Dongxinglou has become a place for many dignitaries to entertain guests. In front of this old building, there are often many cars parked, and the dishes here are also particularly expensive. It is said that the price of an imperial cook is also particularly high. It is said that an imperial cook here only fries one dish, "Snowflake Chicken Stir-Fry," every day, but his monthly salary is more than one hundred yuan. Naturally, his rewards can be imagined.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a Shaguoju. This is a bit more civilian-friendly. This place only sells pork and things from inside the pig's belly. There are not many dishes, but they are very famous. The reason for its fame is not because of the dishes, but mainly because of its history. It is said that this restaurant has been open since the Ming Dynasty. The casserole for stewing soup inside has been passed down from the Ming Dynasty. Since the Ming Dynasty, because water has been constantly added to this casserole, it has never dried out. Therefore, if you go to eat its soup now, you can still taste the soup inherited from the Ming Dynasty, perhaps eating one ten-thousandth of one ten-thousandth of the soup from the Ming Dynasty. At the same time, the rice they cook is the rice from the former imperial fields. Because of this historical legend, many people always flock to this Shaguoju. During Zhang Zongchang's heyday, he even held a grand banquet here for his guests.</p>
<p>A long time ago, I was also moved by this interesting legend and went with two friends to visit this "Ming Dynasty Soup" on Xisi North Street. We searched for a long time and finally found this place. This place is extremely low, with two or three bungalows, and the height is at most a little over ten feet. At the entrance, there is a signboard that has rotted to the point where it cannot be recognized. Inside, there are two small signboards that read: "Kyoto First" and "No Branches." We walked in and occupied a white wooden square table in a very narrow room. In addition to the characteristics of poor light and poor air circulation, there is also the fact that all the waiters are old men in their sixties and seventies. As soon as you call him, he always bends over and slowly deals with you.</p>
<p>It was here that we ate the rice that the emperor used to eat and also drank the so-called "Ming Dynasty Soup"｜Especially throwing us back to a place hundreds of years ago for a revisit.</p>
<p>No matter how fast the times are moving, Beiping still retains remnants of ancient Eastern culture in all aspects. Here, there are not only trams and cars, but also the emperor's cook and the Ming Dynasty's soup. These do not need to be collected by historical museums; they are naturally displayed there.</p>

<h3 id="e289">How to Study the Current Monetary Problem? <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Jianfu</p>
<p>｜Introduction to Several Introductory Books｜</p>
<p>Recently, due to the US inflation, buying gold, raising silver prices, and other things, many studious young people have been dazzled and don't know where to start. Reading newspapers can only let you know a little bit of the facts, and reading magazines and buying books can't find an introductory path that is suitable for your appetite and digestible. Regarding this, not only are many of our amateur young people unable to figure it out, but even many college students and college graduates are not very clear. A few days ago, someone wrote a letter to Shenbao's "Reading Q&amp;A" column asking for reading guidance, but the result of the reading guidance was only about introductory books on general economic theory; for the current urgent monetary problem to be solved, only Hilferding's "Financial Capital" was introduced. I think this is definitely not enough, not to mention that "Financial Capital" is a very difficult and specialized book.</p>
<p>Then how can we solve this problem?｜This is indeed not something that can be done in a few words. Instead of talking about it at length here, I think it would be simpler to introduce several easy-to-understand books to readers.</p>
<p>First of all, it must be stated that there are very few books in Chinese that are easy to understand and systematic. If readers have more free time, they can buy Zhu Binyuan's "Monetary Banking" to read, and it would be even better to buy Takahashi Yoshiki's "Practical Economics" translated by Shi Zhouhe to read (mainly reading the second part). If you don't have much free time, then buy a copy of the "Economic Common Sense" in the Wanyou Library to read, which is always helpful.</p>
<p>Although the above books can be used as a reference for beginners, they are inevitably subject to considerable distortions in theory. However, for the sake of friends who are eager to understand the current monetary phenomenon, this is also the best way to do it.</p>
<p>In English, although there are many textbooks and monographs on monetary issues, it is very difficult to gain insight into the current international monetary issues in the shortest possible time. Fortunately, several very easy-to-understand books have been published recently, and readers may wish to read them.</p>
<p>In the past year, as a result of the implementation of US monetary policy, not only experts and scholars have been arguing, but also the general American public has paid great attention to this issue. In order to meet the needs of the general public, many popular monetary arrangement theory books have emerged. Now, I will introduce four of the more complete books that have already arrived in Shanghai:</p>
<p>(1) "DollarsandSenseOuesrionsandAnswersinFinance"byBrant'</p>
<p>R｜｜This book is compiled in the form of questions and answers. There are clear explanations of general issues and theories of currency, finance, and even finance. Reading this book, you can get a general understanding of the monetary problems that are raging internationally.</p>
<p>(2) "ThePrimeroffnflationbySparlingE||This book is a very easy-to-understand book about "inflation." The "buying gold," "devaluing the gold standard," "raising silver prices," and so on that we see in newspapers and magazines, although there are many tricks, are nothing more than branches of currency expansion. By understanding the essence of inflation, these side branches can naturally be solved easily.</p>
<p>(3) "Tnflation",bywoodwqrd＆Ｒose｜｜To the extent of being popular, the above is "currency stability." After reading their reasons for opposing inflation, we can better understand the true picture of the currency issue. This book also has a very complete description of the history of past monetary expansion and monetary contraction.　(4) "SilvoriAnAoalysisofFactorsAffectingLt'sprice",byLeong,YＳ．｜｜Isn't the silver price issue raging recently? So, if you want to understand the past and current silver issues, silver price issues, etc., this book is worth reading.</p>
<p>Of the above four types, the first three are priced at US$1.10 each, and the last one is US$2. Converted to national currency, the former is less than 5 yuan, and the latter is about 6.5 yuan. The price is indeed a bit expensive. It is best for several people to pool their money to buy one, or ask a nearby library to subscribe.</p>
<p>Finally, let me add a sentence: American books are finally American books. The main purpose of the first few authors is almost to consider the business and property of the readers. Therefore, although these books can help us to understand the phenomenon, they are not necessarily the most correct theoretical books. If you have time, readers should buy a copy of E. Beros’ “TbeOnlyWayOdt” to read. In contrast, what you get is the only "Lu Gao Zhuang" (a famous Chinese sauce braised pork dish).</p>

<h3 id="e290">Settling in One's Profession and Finding Joy in One's Work <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Xuefei</p>
<p>Nowadays, some people advise people to settle in their professions and find joy in their work. Settling in one's profession means that after getting a job, one should settle down and do the existing job with peace of mind, without being fickle. Finding joy in one's work means that after getting a job, one should develop an interest in the existing job, and not just casually pass the day as it comes, or develop disgust. This is said to those who are generally dissatisfied with the status quo. Under the current situation, it is already difficult for ordinary people to get a job. Having a job, whether it is good or bad, is already extremely fortunate. To be unsettled and not find joy in one's work would be tantamount to seeking one's own death. This is of course unacceptable. Therefore, the topic of "settling in one's profession and finding joy in one's work" is even more powerful now.</p>
<p>However, the problem now is not in "settling in one's profession and finding joy in one's work," but in the fact that there is no profession that can be settled in, and no profession that can be found joy in. Settling in one's profession and finding joy in one's work, the prerequisite is that the profession can at least be settled in and can be found joy in, that is to say, engaging in this profession must at least be able to maintain one's livelihood, and at least be able to use one's spare time to develop one's talent, and then strive to improve and find ways to increase one's knowledge, skills, and abilities to develop this profession. In this way, one can settle in and find joy in this profession. But can it be done now? In fact, it is absolutely impossible. We see that many people work hard all day long, but as a result, they still cannot maintain their family's livelihood, or even their own personal livelihood; they still cannot help but be in debt. In this way, can they settle in this profession? This is one. It's fine to have a job, but unfortunately, in this society, things change unexpectedly from morning to night. Any career is in danger of bankruptcy and destruction at any time; also, the boss's joy and anger can also shake the job at any time. In this way, the job is always in an unstable state. People are only preoccupied with maintaining their position day and night, how can they settle in their profession? This is two. Secondly, most of the current jobs are like those of cattle and horses, that is, you have to devote all your energy to your duties every day, so that you can barely earn enough to be half full. Otherwise, standing behind the boss are people looking for jobs, and he can easily replace you and find someone else who is willing to sell more labor. In this way, you will have no remaining time to use for self-study. You can forget about improving your knowledge and skills, and the future is always empty and distant. Also, what you have learned is not what you are using. In order to eat, you have to take up a profession that you are not interested in, and there are many of these. In this situation, how can you ask them to find joy in their work? Since the prerequisites for settling in one's profession and finding joy in one's work are not met, the effects of settling in one's profession and finding joy in one's work are of course impossible to achieve.</p>
<p>Therefore, the problem now is not in settling in one's profession and finding joy in one's work, but in how one can settle in one's profession and how one can find joy in one's work. If these prerequisites cannot be resolved, then all talk of settling in one's profession and finding joy in one's work is empty.</p>
<p>Then, how can we solve these prerequisites for settling in one's profession and finding joy in one's work? This is a big question.</p>
<p>Also, people generally ask people to be diligent, thrifty, and hardworking, which is of course the best thing to do, but unfortunately, this is also empty. It is as difficult as ascending to heaven to find a job now, and it is still as difficult as ascending to heaven to barely maintain a livelihood with it. In this situation, diligence, thrift, and hard work are of course out of the question.</p>
<p>Those without jobs have to find jobs, and those with jobs cannot settle in their professions and find joy in their work. Where should we go? This chaotic society!</p>
<p>Of Speech</p>
<h3 id="e291">Zhang Yousan's Lecture on "The Path to Youth Self-Cultivation" <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Pin Records</p>
<p>(A) Understanding oneself: We must recognize our shortcomings and strengths, and reform our shortcomings while developing our strengths. During adolescence, all parts of the body are developed and mature, which is the time for a person to work hard and strive to achieve something. At this time, there are three characteristics in the mental aspect: one is impulsive behavior. During adolescence, there is always a force urging him to act, because in childhood, the strength, knowledge, and body are not enough to act. In old age, because he has been deeply involved in the world and has rich experience, he has to consider the interests of all parties, so he moves less. Second, altruism: his impulsive behavior is altruistic, not selfish. Third, rich social interaction: he is not only altruistic, but also wants to interact with people more and more. However, impulse is short-lived and scattered. We should train it to become a lasting and organized legitimate action. Altruism should cultivate the spirit of being eager to do public good. Social interaction should be trained to be able to cooperate with people, and a complete outlook on life must be understood.</p>
<p>(B) Understanding the nation: Now you can often hear a fashionable saying: "Promote the national spirit," but the Chinese national spirit has good and bad aspects. Now, let's cite the observation points of three famous people from China and abroad to represent the Chinese national spirit. Liang Rengong said that the characteristics of the Chinese national spirit are six: one is slavery, two is ignorance, three is fondness for hypocrisy, four is selfishness, five is sloppiness, and six is fondness for profit. Japanese Ōsaka Shūsai said there are eight: one is belief in fate, two is loyalty and filial piety, three is weakness, four is fondness for profit, five is selfishness, six is conservatism, seven is interesting, and eight is contradictions. The American Huntington said there are seven: one is lack of organizational skills, two is selfishness, three is diligence and hard work, four is laziness, five is hypocrisy, six is loyalty and filial piety, and seven is conservatism. Combining the observations of the three, the Chinese nation has two major shortcomings: one is selfishness, and two is fondness for conservatism and lack of ambition. Japanese Araki Sadao said to the League of Nations investigation team; Chinese people are like sand, they cannot be combined together, and Japanese people are like cement, they have solidarity. When Japanese people mention Greater Japan, they have an incredible spirit. Recently, a famous educator actually said: "It's better to do less than to do more." This spirit of muddling along is the most common characteristic of China. Speaking of foreigners saying that Chinese people love peace, this kind of peace is used to deal with foreigners. Once the soldiers are under the city, they talk about peace. As for their own people in the country? Just look at the public buses in Shanghai driving on the road. If the rickshaw in front is a little slow, there will be a pig-like shout. If the rickshaw puller replies to him, he may come down and fight him. This situation can be seen everywhere in China. Also, the best spirit of the Chinese, hard work and endurance, is now slowly degenerating, so we must cultivate the national spirit that the Chinese nation needs.</p>
<p>(C) Understanding the times: We should (1) pay attention to true thoughts (that is, the spirit and method of science), observe with an objective attitude, and abandon subjective and mysterious thoughts. (2) Pay attention to the welfare of the masses. There is an ancient Greek saying: "Man is the measure of all things." Now let us add a sentence, that is, this person must seek the welfare of the masses and the nation.</p>
<p>Shang Tang has a saying: "If you can one day renovate yourself, do so again and again, and forever renovate yourself," this spirit of continuous self-improvement can be used as a model for us. Now all countries in the world advocate "survival of the fittest." The term competition is both progressive and harmful to the same kind. It is completely a selfish behavior, that is, the strong prey on the weak. We should advocate cooperation, "I am for everyone, and everyone is for me." Cooperation is the most modern, the most perfect, and the most universal self-cultivation.</p>
<p>In short, the purpose of self-cultivation is to cultivate a socialized personality. The welfare of society is my welfare. There is no small self, only a big self. Integrating society and myself, self-cultivation is for the sake of society. Goethe said it well: "A good character is never cultivated in selfish ideas." We must fundamentally eradicate the root of the disease and observe ourselves with an objective attitude. Lu Xun said: "To develop an objective attitude, you must be interested in all aspects of the business." For example, in a speech, don't always pay attention to your own posture, movements, and attitude. You must devote all your energy to paying attention to the audience and forget yourself. To cultivate a great personality, you must work hard for mankind and for society, and you must not have the hope of how to improve myself. This is the highest self-cultivation. The last sentence is: what is said must be done, and knowledge and action must be united.</p>
