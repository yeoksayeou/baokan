<h3 id="c24">德奥合併之國際難關恒 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>今次奥變。法意等國。皆皇皇顧慮。猶恐引起德奥變相的合併。打破歐洲之均勢。吾人昨已已及。然德奥合併。難關重重。非以武力撕毁大戰後之和約。絶無轉圖之可能也。</p>
<p>說者謂今日之德意志。欲求國運之復興。當以聯合各地日耳曼人爲首務之急。然德國以外日耳曼人最佔多數者。莫若今之奥地利。故德奥合併爲發揮大日耳曼主義必採之手腕。一日成爲事實。凡爾塞和約所加於德國之象縛。可以去其大半。而德之土地人口。亦將恢復戰前之舊觀。至是而推進戰前發起之東向運動。或有成功之望。</p>
<p>德人之懷抱如此。苟能如願以償。勢必重行改造今日歐洲之地圖。而引起第二次之大戰。其不能安然成功。可以預想。與德世仇之法蘭西必將盡力阻撓德勢之復振。以免東顧之隱　。其次反對德奥合併者則爲意國。蓋合併而成。則德意間之緩衝盡撤。隨而危及意大利在亞得里海之覇權。與巴爾幹半島之發展。正未可料。且大戰之後。意大利割據奥之南疆併有當地日耳曼人二十五萬。設德奥合併。則大日耳曼主義之氣燄將不可嚮邇。比二十五萬之日耳曼人。勢必聞風崛起。以求脫離異族之覊絆而歸附於德。此少數民族問題。亦爲意人腹心之大患而不容漠視者也。再次則爲捷克。捷克居今日奥國之北。其西則深入德境。如德奥合併。便有受德三面包圍之虞。加以捷克。現有日耳曼人三百二十萬。其所感大日耳曼主義之威脅。遂亦遠過於意。至於波蘭現雖與德成立十年不侵條約。然其境内有日耳曼人二百餘萬。故對德奥之合併。當亦有同様之不利。歐洲各國較能同情於德國者。唯有與德無甚權利衝突之英國。然英亦究爲凡爾塞和約之簽字國。對法共同維持條約之請求。似難　之不理。加以希脫拉登臺之後。種種作爲。暴戾恣睢。大喪英國之好感。故此次對於奥變之態度。亦與法意一致也。</p>
<p>國際間之難關。旣若此之多。爲德國希脫拉計。自唯有二途可走。一卽無條件的屈服。一卽排除萬難。奪取奥國政權。據最近外電。德國社黨已有威迫奥總理自動辭職之要求是其所採之途徑何屬。顯然可見。吾人於此所可預想者。卽奥亂或將重作。届時法意各國亦必採取切實有效之辦法以履行其維持奥國獨立之夙願也。若然。則歐陸風雲。又將復現。吾人拭目以觀其後可也。</p>

<p>意警告德勿干與奥事</p>
<p>德對奥宣布休戰十日</p>
<p>奥國對德表示不信任</p>
<p>羅馬　意大利日報爲意首相墨索里尼之機關報、今日著論警告德國勿干涉奥事、措詞異常嚴厲、謂英法意三國之聯合宣言、申明維持奥國完整與獨立之必要、已佈置一致態度及必要時一致行動之途徑、近今國家社會黨在奥之横暴舉動、其爲德人所指使、現已毫無疑義、奥國境内殺人之槍彈大半來自德國、意國欲使條約得公允之修正、顧此不能作爲聽人自由爲其所欲爲之解、不過欲依據公認之正義謀國家與土地之集合的與有規則的恢復耳、意國决不放棄其爲大國所應有之責任與義務云、意國報紙之表示輿情須受嚴格檢查、故上述言論頗堪注意、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>慕尼黑　今日國家社會黨宣傳員哈璧特向陶爾斐斯總理及奥政府提出休戰、哈氏由强大無線電播音向全奥演說稱、國社黨現給予陶爾斐斯總理以十日之休戰時期以考慮陶氏退職及對德更密切合作之要求、休戰時期至二十八日截止、在此休戰期間、所有國社黨員、均禁止以武力或宣傳攻擊政府、如奥政府不接受此項要求、或其答復不能使人滿意、「則休戰期滿後、戰爭又將開始矣、」哈氏曾一再勸告軍隊以及平民加入其所領導之團體以驅逐陶爾斐斯總理而以國社黨另組織新政府、據觀察者稱、奥國之「小拿破崙」有三路可走、（一）用武力遏止國社黨之攻擊、（二）接受國社黨之要求而引退、（三）向國聯申訴、觀察家繼稱、德國社黨能以狡言抹煞英法意最近簽字之三國宣言、蓋國社黨稱、德政府並不欲騙逐陶爾斐斯總理、欲驅逐陶爾斐斯總理出維也納而攫取政權者國社黨也、陶爾斐斯總理原極端反對將此項糾紛交國聯處理、現時陶爾斐斯恐不能不採取此項辦法矣、奥國全境、大部已平</p>
<p>舉行示威、並有國社黨與巡警發生衝突云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>維也納　德國國家社會黨宣傳員哈璧特昨日在慕尼黑演說、德奥兩國休戰至二月二十六日爲止、維也納各報對於此息全未知悉、各報訪員及官塲方面咸認哈璧特此種態度、乃係一種慣用之手段、實屬毫無根據、奥國政府方面聲明、維也納並未接得德國政府之任何提議、且德國一方面提議講和、一方面則請奥國社會黨員加入國社黨、可見毫無誠意、因此各方對於哈璧特之演說、更不加以重視云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>德報作解嘲之論</p>
<p>維也納　英法意三國曾經發表共同宣言、主張維持奥國獨立、奥國政府人士認爲援助奥國之明證、甚表歡迎、但此項宣言、在實際上有無效力、則頗爲悲觀、以爲德奥關係問題、仍當提付國聯會處理、且爲期甚促云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）今日柏林半官式外交政治評論報載一論文、稱法國之所以發起英法意三國聯合發表宣言維持奥國獨立者、實因法國政府對於軍縮問題已深刻厭倦、故特造作此事以期稍分世界輿論之視綫耳、英意德三國近有一種恊定成立、此次英德意三國對奥事之宣言、不啻係對此恊定之一種對策也、該報復稱、法國政府雖屢次聲明、該項三國宣言雖雖係由巴黎發起、但意大利方面實早已有此意云、查英意兩國之所以我與法國合發宣言者、實不過不願以此事煩勞國聯、或採取其他更不適當之國際步驟、故僅與法國虚與委蛇耳、故以此對已成之事實論之、此項三國宣言不能認爲法國政策之勝利、實爲奥國行動之失敗、蓋奥國欲以此事由國聯處理、或由此而將内亂之事變、加以國際之範圍、此等企圖均已著著失敗也、奥國杜爾夫斯政府挾持偏見、甘使事態惡化、幸其請求已見駁斥實給與德國完全之勝利云、至三國宣言中所提及之維持奥國獨立與領土完整、與現行條約不得背棄等語、亦正與德總理希特勒不以武力干涉奥國内政及不侵犯與奥國有關係之任何條約之宣言吻合無間云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）英法意三國發表共同宣言、主張維持奥國獨立、此間報紙評論此事、對於意大利極表不滿、半官式政治外交通信報、主張由德國採取新策略、以資應付、卽奥國問題若照各國主張、由國聯會或在國際上加以討論、則德國卽當要求將德奥聯合問題、由奥國公民投票决定之云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>慕尼黑　哈璧特雖在德國並無官職、然德國國家社會黨以奥國監督視之、屢作不利於奥國之播音演說、致奥政府提出外人干涉内政之嚴重責言、今哈氏又作危詞恫嚇、大約奥政府將以此訴諸列强、哈氏原爲駐奥德使署之新聞隨員、因陰謀活動、致於去年七月爲奥政府所驅逐、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>匈牙利京城　匈牙利各報對於英法意三大國主張維持奥國獨立之聯合宣言殊少評論、惟超然派之阿石斯德報、則對於此舉表示歡忭、謂奥國獨立卽匈牙利之屏藩云、匈京民聲報、則謂奥匈兩國經濟相互關係、倘能擴大、則兩國均獲其利、惟奥匈提携與德奥合併運動、二者實背道而馳、非奥匈合作、卽德奥合併、二者必居其一、奥國苟能保持獨立、則奥匈兩國自必日益接近云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>維也納　駐奥英使今日奉政府之命謁見奥總理杜爾夫斯、陳明英國輿論殊不以奥當局對付近今變亂近取之手段爲然、並謂奥當局早知社會黨凖備作武力之抗拒、曷爲不預事防範、以阻流血之禍發生、此實英人所不解者云、杜氏聞言、卽向該使釋明亂事眞相、並奥政府之困難地位、（二十日國民社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）下議院工黨各議員、　對於奥國政府懲治社會黨事、激烈反抗、該黨議員威治伍、本日詢問外相西門曰、英法意三國、對奥國獨立問題之妥恊、是否有承認殘殺之意義云云、各議員聞悉此言、僉作反對奥國政府之表示、保守黨某議員、繼起詢問、各國對於奥加獨立之見地、是否不因奥國政府待遇勞工階級之方法、而發生變動、是時人聲嘈雜實甚、外相西門、旋答稱、歐洲和平繫於奥國之是否崩潰、此種見解、欲因奥國最近事變而加以變更、殊覺不便云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>維也納　外國報紙近盛傳意匈奥三國政治首領不久在羅馬舉行會議之後、三國間將成立關稅同盟云、此項傳說此處對之尚甚覺懷疑、蓋上次杜爾夫斯總理前訪問匈京之時、曾對於此種建議表示其難以施行、因意國對奥並無何種利益可給以補償也、查遠在一九二二年、意大利卽有建設意奥稅同盟之提議、但大久卽自動撤消、因彼自覺無以担負其所應得之重大責任云、今日奥總理杜爾夫斯復於延見匈牙利某報記者、聲言彼對於外間之傳說旣不能證實、亦不能否認、但以現在形勢而言、關稅同盟實屬不成問題、但奥匈間苟欲成立一種密切合作之辦法、自然不在屏除之列云、（十九日國民社電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）據此間海軍專家言、一九三五年海軍會議、對於軍艦噸位限額大加修改、擬將最高噸位三萬五千噸、减至三萬噸或二萬五千噸、美國雖竭力反對减少軍艦噸位、但目下並無建築大軍艦之動議、且最近政府態度又經改變、前英日法意諸國均在日内瓦商議减少軍艦噸位、僅美國極力反對、英國擬改最大噸位爲二萬二千噸、日本則擬改爲二萬五千噸、各小海軍國則均擬改以一萬噸爲最高限度、惟詳細調查之下、則各國於戰後均未曾建造極大噸位之盤隻云、英國計有大軍艦十五艘、胡特號最大、爲四萬二千一百噸、在一九二○年下水、其餘各艦均有二萬九千一百五十噸左右、英國軍艦總噸位數爲四十七萬四千七百五十噸、美國亦有大軍艦十五艘、以本雪文尼亞號爲最大、計三萬三千一百噸、最小之埃根空斯號亦有二萬六千一百噸、美國海軍軍艦總額爲四十五萬五千四百五十噸、從前美國因各處領土周顧完全起見、極力主張造大噸位之軍艦、但現據專家之研究、二萬五千噸之船隻亦頗可應用、日本有大軍艦十艘、噸位總數爲二十九萬八千四百噸、日本以美國之强大海軍爲慮、故極力主張减少軍艦噸位云、（二十日國民社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）前在衆院通過之文生氏大海軍計劃、今日已在參院正式討論、按該提案内容、係按照海軍會議條約、儘量建築軍艦一百二十艘、及海軍飛機一千一百八十四架、因目前世界情形、以驅逐艦潛水艇及派機三者最爲重要、現美國正在建造一萬五千噸重之飛機母艦一艘、不日卽可落成云、（十九日國民電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）今日美國蔲蒂斯蘭特飛機公司總經理尤亨申稱、蘇俄政府現正與美政府磋商訂購飛機引擎合同、約須借欵二百五十萬元、渠又謂該公司曾代蘇俄製造飛機引擎、現將完全交貨、目下計劃、擬在俄國設廠、派美國技師前往指導、按蘇俄當局擬將蘇俄軍編成世界第一、因現在各國正在競爭海軍問題也、據軍事世家之視察、俄國空軍已佔世界第二位、較英美爲優、僅稍遜於法國耳、據云、俄國能於每日造成飛機三十五架、一旦遠東發生問題、或與日本作戰、則頗能應付裕如、至於蘇俄與美政府商量借欵事、最近美俄兩國互相携手、此事大約不難成功云、（十九日國民電）</p>

<p>東北人民之血涙</p>
<p>日本之統制經濟</p>
<p>農民之困苦顚連</p>
<p>東北三省、被日軍蹂躏、已兩年有餘、現在幾乎没有一個地方没有日軍、東三省幾乎完全在日本統治之下了、但祇有一個例外、就是吉林的東北部沿烏蘇里江以至黑龍江交义的三角地帶、卽撫遠·饒河·虎林·三縣、還高標着青天白日旗、還繼續保持着中華民國的年號、前天有人從饒河來、據他所談的情形、在那邊最困難的、是人烟稀少、給養困難、子彈缺乏還是比較的小事、因爲那裏的義軍起事之初、不是綠林、不是正式軍隊、而是當地的的紅槍會大刀刀、一年半以前、僅持民族的熱血、持着刀槍與敵軍拼命、又因爲地理的便利、山脈的起伏、森林的茂密、而勉存在着、現在被四圍封鎖着、國内援助、自然難於達到、國外的交通、也是萬難、現時賴以支持的、祇憑着耐苦的精誠而已、那三縣的義軍、吃的祇有玉麥麵一種、冬天來了、自然没有蔬菜、也没有鹽、其他一切人生必需品、他們都没有、衣服的補充、全靠遊獵而來的幾隻野獸的生皮、</p>
<p>不過他們自已創作了幾種新的東西、第一、他們没有紙、但有殘存着没有壞的筆、他們要寫條命令、通個信息、就用玉黍麥内面的包皮作紙、勉强寫起來、他們還是要想吸烟、無論捲烟是没有到手的可能、卽是作成了的旱烟、也如同珍寶、可是他們却用菜刀或用剌刀、把烟葉切成烟絲、再用玉麥包皮包起來當作烟吸、諸如此類的事、眞可以說是被逼迫得不得已而對時代開倒車了、可是當事者、還以爲要奮鬥到底、還要用他們原始的方法與新銳的帝國主義者、拼個死活呢、</p>
<p>講到日本對付東三省的人民又是何如呢、首先我們要想到所謂「滿洲國」的租稅、在日本侵略東北之初、口口聲聲說是推倒軍閥统治、因此在過去曾有不少的人民受牠的麻醉、有很多人甘心替牠作走狗、圖目前之利、更痴望將來的利益、然而到了現在、事實是漸次明白了、租稅的加增、確實與日俱進、璧如在以前每「天」（東北地積名、在遼寗爲十畝、每畝七百二十方步）所徵收的正稅和附加、最多不過七元五角、現在竟每「天」增加到十七八元以至二十元了、所幸者是近二年來收成很好、還可以勉强撑持、度着耐苦的生活、</p>
<p>其次、是糧食價錢低落、較從前竟少二分之一以下、鄉下人莫不呌苦連天、要賣出的糧食賣不出去、要購買的衣服等類必需品、却買不進來、最苦的是人爲的限制、日本旣將各鐵路都收歸南滿路公司管理、於是把運費加得很高、在農村中祇賣三四元一石的紅糧、運去關内、就非在十元以上不可了、這様的毒計、眞是困得鄉民無路可走、</p>
<p>再次、是實施其所謂的總制經濟、把東三省各地、除上述上數縣日軍權力所不能達到的地方以外、都一齊施行人民生活總調查、把人口·土地·牲畜·車·雪撬·鷄·犬·等等、都由縣政府通知各區各鄉、由各鄉區負責登記、將表册送縣、由縣送省、由省送達日本關東軍司令部、一旦有事、牠就可以按照調查表、分飭各縣、絶無遺漏的指派出去、眞是無有倖免的、不久之前、長春和吉林附近、曾被派馬匹車輛爲旭川師團赴興安嶺之用、被徵發之後、再没有還回來的、現在雖然祇算是凖備時期、而東北人民的經濟生命、眞是完全操諸日人之手、要圖反正、也得大費氣力啊、（二月九日）</p>

<p>我天天差不多非讀它不可，然不幸上面研討的，有許多，不是同我的生活環境不同，就是和我的程度不合。所以還是使我不能滿意，得不到一點門徑，我想：指導先生是爲一切讀書發生了疑難的人而指路的，並没有限定要達到某種程度，或某種階級才指導。所以我不揣冒昧，用此淺拙的文字，也來我的讀書問題寫來請教；</p>
<p>我的生活環境，當然是很窮困，然而，除了爲生活而勞動外，也還有些空暇的時間，供我自已處理，所以讀書在我也　成爲問題了。　　大槪是受了我的朋友們是常談社會思想的影響以及看到社會現實暴露了很多不良的現象罷，我對於社會科學生出了非常的興趣，所以在這兩三年以來，讀了些社會科學的書籍。可是像我這様對社會科學没　點根基，中西文字又不行的一個人，將那些深奥的書，没頭没腦的瞎讀，實在是盲人瞎馬。寶貴的光陰花費了許多，益處依然有限。</p>
<p>我的一些朋友，他們的學問都比我高。有時去請教他們，或請介紹書讀，然而或因他們受了現社會各社會學派學理的影響，見解又不一致，介紹書目也不同。如此反把我越弄得莫明其妙了。</p>
<p>最近一個友人對我說：「你要得到社會的眞實及將來，經濟科學當然是你讀的對象，可是對於法律政治也不能不有相當的明瞭呢！頂好你現在去把經濟學弄清楚，一也没有指出那幾本書），再去讀點法律政治的槪論　類的書，然後再去讀史地，你想很高的樓，一步就想上去是不行的。</p>
<p>但是我何常又不知道學問不是短時期的事呢！還不是因爲窮，不能享受那種貴族式教育的權利嗎！我前天跑到圖書館一看，僅就經濟　類的書而論，已在千種以上，况我還要忙中偷閑支讀它，就是終日以全部的時間用在它的上面，上年的工夫還不知怎様呢！其他的政治法律史地還在外。</p>
<p>指導　生：你看教我怎麽辦！我又不想做個社會學者，只要求得社會將來究竟到何處就行了。像這様，你看我要讀幾本什麽書？先讀那一類？統祈賜以良教，使我道個述於書城的人，得到一條光明的大道。</p>

<p>— 周黎民</p>
<p>成功是一對父母產出的寗馨兒丨丨敏捷與準確。</p>
<p>無論那一位成功的人物，他一生裏面總有「一髮千鈞」「稍縱卽逝」的重要關頭，當這種時候，倘若心裏一游移不决，或徬徨失措，就要全功盡棄，一無所成！</p>
<p>遇着事就敏捷去做的人，卽使偶有錯誤，也必終於成功；一個因循躭誤的人，就是有較好的判斷力，也必終於失敗。</p>
<p>一人不幸做了「遲疑不决」的犧牲者，其唯一的救星是「敏捷的决斷，果敢的行爲」！</p>
<p>對　要敏捷，還要凖確，與人交際上最尋常而却最神聖的凖確是踐約。與人約了一定的時候，臨時不到或遲到，除有眞正的萬不得理由外，便是一件有意欺人的事情，在新道德方面是一件切忌的惡根性。拿破崙有一次請他的幾位大將用膳。到了預約的時候，那幾位大將還没有到，他一個人大嚼一噸；等到他們來了，他已經吃完，離座對他們說：「諸君，用膳的時候過了，我們立刻要去辦公」！</p>
<p>敏捷是信用之母，敏捷最能證明我們治事有序，做得好，使人信任我們的能力；至於確守時間的人，常是能够守信的人，也就是可恃的人。</p>

<p>色有紅黄青三者曰『原色』，其他一切諸色由原色相間而成者率曰『間色』，白色能反光，善射熱，宜夏宜春；人稱曰，冷色。黑色紅色有反白色之功能，人卽命名曰熱色，北極地帶奇寒，雪地冰天，常存皓色，故其地所產之鳥獸，羽毛多爲白色。温帶氣候和煦，春夏時節，草木青青，其應時而生之昆虫，多呈綠色，這所謂得天獨厚的保護色。南朝金粉，北地胭脂，係唯美派的詩人詠美人的粉紅色。佛家云：「色卽是空」「空卽是色」啓示人們，勿沉湎於色，藍衫之黨，藍鷹運動，赤色恐怖，白色帝國主義，此皆政治上分門别類的顏色。不景氣的社會，呈現出頽廢萎鹹，深深地籠罩着愁雲慘霧，這是象徵着社會的灰色。自非孝的叛徒，倡了反「百行孝爲先」的主義，還談什麽「膝下色養」，小流氓起了意氣之爭，他媽的，下文，便是「把儂顏色看」，其實，人與人，國與國，明爭暗鬭，又何嘗不是幹的這「把儂顏色看」的一類的勾當。什麽主義解放人民自由，什麽主義是高喊民族平等，不過事實給我們看見的，亦不過是些摩洛哥的婦女幽禁在「黑欄」中的一類的生活，這光怪陸離的社會，眞弄得人們目迷五色！</p>

<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>我們平常計算年月日，有陽曆陰曆兩種，（一）陽曆就是太陽曆，是照回歸年所編成的，換句話來說，就是按照太陽的視運動而成的，（我們從地球上觀察太陽的一周轉所需的時間而定，）一次回歸年爲三百六十五日二四二二餘，因爲實用上便利起見，定平年爲三百六十五日，閏年三百六十六日。所以把回歸年的零數，用四倍乘去來，就有零日九六八八餘，這就是平年過了三年後就有一年閏年的。可是仍舊有過與不足的，並非眞正精密的數目，因爲照這様計算起來，還有極微的數，過了四百年，有三百一二的餘數，那未過了百年二百年三百年，不得不有閏年以補足的。（如以西曆紀元年數之四除之所得之年爲閏年，但用百除之中，不能再用四除之年，就爲平年。）（二）太陽曆的月份大小，凡一三五七八十十二等月，都爲三十一日的大月，四六九十一等月，都爲三十日的小月，二月平年爲二十八日，閏年爲二十九日，所以二月爲小小月。這是因爲沿襲古代羅馬奴麻王時代的不完全曆法，並没有特别深意的（三）太陰曆的算法，是本於月的盈虧所編的。有兩種計法，第一爲單照太陰的盈虚爲目標，亦稱純太陰曆，第二依照太陽運行而起氣候的變遷，加以酌量的。又稱爲陰陽曆，第一種是回回教曆，第二種是爲中國曆，亦稱希臘曆。其月的盈虚，爲二十九日五三○六弱，十二個月爲三百五十四日三六七强，所以陰曆以三百五十四日或三百五十五日爲一年，其實比回歸年三百六十五日要少十一日，所以不到三年，就不足三十日了。因此過了兩年有一個閏月，以爲調節回歸年的。（四）春夏秋冬四季中，每季有六個節，這二十四節的名稱，普通人雖都知道，但是每個節的意義，多不明白的，現在我把節氣簡明的一說，立春爲發生陽春的氣，雨水爲冰雪化爲雨水，驚蟄爲伏在地下的虫豸，要爬到地上，春分爲春的中間晝夜平分的，清明爲草木發生枝葉，榖雨爲滋養百榖，（以上爲春季六節）立夏爲夏氣初發，小滿爲萬物漸漸將滿，芒種爲種植有芒榖類的時節，夏至爲到夏氣至極的時，日子是最長，小暑爲催暑氣，大暑是覺到暑氣最盛，（以上爲夏季六節）立秋爲秋氣初來，處暑爲暑氣已退，白　爲露降時節，秋分爲秋的中間，晝夜平分，寒露爲陰寒的日愈增，霜降爲露結成霜，（以上爲秋季六節）立冬爲冬氣已到，小雪是雨水凝結爲雪，大雪是常要降雪，冬至是冬氣最盛，日子最短，小寒是寒氣稍烈，大寒是覺到很寒。（五）節分爲陰曆冬春節氣所分之日，是在立春前一日，入梅爲入梅雨的日，就是達到太陽黄經八十度，（以春分爲起點，平分黄道三百六十的度數）過芒種後六日，半夏生是生藥草半夏的時，這日達到太陽黄經百度，（六）現在以日月火水木金土等七曜星，分配一得期内的日子，如月爲星期一，火爲星期二，水爲星期三，這是距今二千三百年以前，猶太的加爾台耶的占星家所創始的，（七）月相爲數千年來所因襲，其月的形狀，可以定一個月内的日期，譬如朔爲新月，望爲滿月，初七八爲上弦月，二十二三爲下弦月等，（八）日蝕是在新月，就是月球遮蔽太陽面，使發射於地面的太陽光爲其隔斷，有完全蝕，金環蝕，部分蝕的分。月食是在滿月，因爲地球遮蔽太陽面隔斷日光發射於月面的現象，以上所說曆的在識，看看是很簡淺，可是社會上不懂的人，要占十分之九哩。</p>

<h3 id="c254">中國學生怎様 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 樊仲雲</p>
<p>關於歐洲各國的國民性，曾有這様一則有名的故事：</p>
<p>『有一個學校裏的教師，一天對其隷屬各國國籍的學生，發表他的考試題目，那題目是關於象的。英國學生對於這個題目，寫了一篇「非洲獵象記」；法國學生作了一首短詩，是「象的戀愛」；德國學生則對於這個象的題材，寫了一篇長三百張原稿紙的論文，呌作「象之哲學序論」；還有一個波蘭學生，寫了一篇政治論文，呌作「象與波蘭問題」。』</p>
<p>在鶴見祐輔的歐美大陸遊記中，我見到了這故事，不禁想起倘若那個學校中，有個中國學生，不知他將寫點什麽。</p>
<p>我想，倘若是在三十年前的話，那末這個中國學生必定是一篇關於象的八股文，然而現在是中華民國紀元，八股早已廢除，甚至那韓柳歐蘇以至桐城陽湖等的古文，雖然頗有人主張恢復，可也已經壽終正寢了，在這時候，倘是我們中國的學生，他們到底寫點什麽呢？</p>
<p>那末依舊是八股文，不過是白話的，新式的罷了。</p>
<p>因爲由文字的教育，當然不外字句的彫琢，文章的修飾，一種空洞而無内容的文字的游戲，而這却正是中國八股文的特徵。</p>
<p>現在，固然八股已經廢除，文言也已改爲白話，然而舊時代的精神却仍根深柢固的存在着。學校的教育以文字爲重，學校的成績便是文字的優劣，國家的考試也以文章作爲甄别的標凖。</p>
<p>『天子重英豪，文章教爾曹，萬般皆下品，唯有讀書高，』這話是直到現在還十分適用的。</p>
<h3 id="c255">「旅人」與「街頭的女兒」 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>在「現代」二月號里，有兩首詩，我覺得是值得注意的。一首是「旅人」（佚名），一首是「街頭的女兒」（蘇俗）。</p>
<p>這幾年來，很少看見好的詩歌出現。而特别是在抒情小詩中，「風花雪月」式的作品，是占大多數的。反映出社會性，現代性的作品，好像比較是少數。</p>
<p>詩歌須有境界，是不錯的。但那個境界須是社會的反映。</p>
<p>在「旅人」和「街頭的女兒」中，固然，没有大的港灣，喧囂的工塲，深入地下的礦坑，爵士樂喧奏着的跳舞廳，摩天樓的百貨店，廣大的競馬塲等等現代的景物，但是，他們也是有深刻的現代性的。</p>
<p>那兩首詩里，是深深地表現出某一部分人的悲哀。那種悲哀，自然地，是世界經濟恐慌和中國農村崩潰的產物。</p>
<p>在「旅人」中，表露出現代的一部分小市民的抑鬱和悲哀。詩人想像着在「修長的旅途上」的「携着哀愁的筴笥以跋踄的旅人，」看着他們的「踟蹰」和「遲疑」。這種「遲疑」和「踟蹰」，不是時代的象徵之一麽？對於這種旅人，詩人指示說：「願你從此拂袖而去，伴着西伯利亞的放逐，引吭高歌。」這種呌人作流浪人的情緒中，是含着如何地深沉的悲痕呀！我覺得這種没有頽廢性的悲痛是可寶貴的。詩人是永遠眷戀着他所「眷戀的樂土」罷！「旅人」一類的題材，經過好多人的採用，可是永遠没有深化到這個程度。自然，這首詩裏，利用舊的辭藻，是人的缺點。不過，在節奏上，不見有什麽矯揉造作。這也是反映着在申國的封建性之濃厚。</p>
<p>蘇俗的「街頭的女兒」是現代的經濟恐慌的一個反映。材料是非常地現實的。中國的貧窮化已普及到街頭的賣笑者的身上來了。這首詩里，顯明地，表出了題材的時空性。我們讀來讀去，一點不見有虚構的成分。同這首詩比，「旅人」自然是空虚得多了。詩人很鮮明地表示出悲劇是發生在最近的上海街頭。詩人用着：「煩厭的是黄梅時節的陰雨天，她歡喜月子飄上來的黄昏」兩句，一方面表示着地方背景，一方面表示出那個賣笑女連自然力的氣都得受。「嘴角上啣着一根香烟提着空的皮夾子，在水門汀的路上，孤零地漫步」着的那位賣淫女，賣風騷，飛眼，等着買笑的男子，可是，結果呢，則只好「他夾着空的皮夾子，煩憂地走在回家的路上。」那種景象，眞是凄凉！但爲什麽没有買笑的男子呢？那是她不知道的。她追求：「怎様這生意還會零落？」可是，尋不出理由來。然而「人們在街頭浪似地翻着」呢！詩人把年關同失業連繫起來，而同時指示出失業的不只她自已一人。是「年紅燈一片一片的，她的同伴一羣一羣的」喲。是同様地失業的罷？詩人不只描寫了那一個孤單的妓女，更描寫了歲暮上海街頭的様子，和她的集團，而且注意到小販的嘲弄和她的習慣於那様的調笑。這是如何地寫實的呀！這首詩有牠的普遍性，更有牠的個性。用語上没有粉飾的辭藻，節奏上没有造作的痕跡。是一首眞實的詩。我以爲蘇俗確是一位前途遠大的新的詩人。如果把這首詩同臧克家的「神女」比較一下，更可以知道這首詩的價值了。臧克家藉着「神女」表露他的堅忍主義的哲學（Ｓtoicisme），蘇俗則是現實的忠實的描寫者了。像「街頭的女兒」一類的詩歌，希望今後，多產生些出來。誰說詩歌中不能寫平凡的現實材料呢？</p>
<h3 id="c256">筵席 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>筵席在開始。主人是一個什麽處的處長，被宴請的貴客是一個有着同等地位的新上任的科長，另外七八個陪客却都是不重要的角色，隷屬於科長手下倚科長爲衣食父母的怪可憐的科員。</p>
<p>這就形成了普通筵席上所不常見的一種景象。面對面坐着的主人和客人，處長和科長成了天邊的大熊星。七八個做着陪客的科員們，則衆星拱北斗似的圍繞在兩邊。他們似乎深知道自已正處在帮閒的地位，没有意志的自由，也没有隨便發言的權利，於是便都乖巧地沉默着。除了一道菜上來相應說道「請呀請呀」以外，便惟處長和科長兩人的馬首是瞻。每逢處長或科長說了一句話，科員們便有的點着頭，有的把頭在空氣裏打着圈，表示這是無可非難的眞理，不論什麽人都應該相信的。處長和科長的話說得愈是起勁。科員們的點頭打圈也便愈是厲害。</p>
<p>這時，廚子剛送上來一盆熱炒。科長嚐了一口，似乎覺得味道很好，忍不住稱贊了一聲道：</p>
<p>「這菜的滋味倒不錯！」</p>
<p>科員們正都夾了一筷菜，要送到口裏去，聽了這句話，來不及的連忙點頭打圈。很有幾個人不留心，鼻頭碰在菜上，燙得生痛，可是口裏仍舊都一迭連聲的附和稱贊着：</p>
<p>「果然入口鮮美，不同凡品！」</p>
<p>「這様好滋味的菜，我已有多年没吃到過了！」</p>
<p>主人很高興，因爲菜受了贊美。客人也很高興，因爲自已居然也有了說話的機會，而這一句話，不用說是也和處長或科長說的話一様，可以列入無可非難的眞理之一，有着不朽的價值的。</p>
<p>然而不幸得很！科長忽然在大家都靜默着的時候，撒了一個屁，聲音很響，無法遮暪，連科長自已臉上都不免有些赧赧然。科員們旣不便點頭，又不便打圈，更可惡的是誰都忍不住要笑，這就使大家都窘得不亦樂平。幸而有一個科員比較機伶，低下頭來，恰好瞧見桌下有一隻狗在亂鑽，於是便用力踢了牠一脚。狗受了痛，「汪」的一聲怪呌，啣着一塊骨頭跑出去了。處長觸機似的說：　　「近來城裏的野狗很多。」</p>
<p>科員們當然誰都懂得帮閒法，便你一句我一句的，都把話題移到狗身上去，有的說應該代狗設立收容所。有的說不如爽爽快快的執行死刑，在狗身上縛了石塊沉下河去。有的說沉在河裏不好，容易發生瘟疫，不如用電刑。說來說去，說到後來，連科長也很高興的抛却了先前的羞赧，加進來談話了。而這一個屁，也就成了懸案，没有人根究是誰撒的。</p>
<p>席散後，客人都坐着喝茶。主人處長從裏面取出一碟金絲蜜棗來，誇張似的得意地說：</p>
<p>「這是從香港來的眞正金絲蜜棗，大家不要客氣，請隨意用呀。」</p>
<p>雖然說是隨意用，先下手的人當然還得讓科長。他拈了一顆蜜棗，放在口裏一嚼，恰恰這顆蜜棗没有核，於是他便没口子的稱贊着說：</p>
<p>「眞不愧是從香港來的金絲蜜棗！我想這一定是用科學方法焙製的，所以連核都没有。」</p>
<p>這話使科員們都有些爲難了，因爲他們每人都吃了一顆蜜棗，偏偏每顆蜜棗裏都有核。現在聽科長這様說，覺得科長的話是天經地義，科長旣然說没有核，自已却把核吐了出來，不是有心和科長作對，坍科長的台嗎？要是科長一怒，下令免職，則不但飯碗打破，連一家大小都得啼飢號寒。這様想着，覺得這一顆棗核，實在所關匪細了。於是，便只得大家都攢着眉，勉强把這顆細細的兩頭尖銳得像鋼針一様的棗核，　下肚去。</p>
<p>科長又拈了一顆蜜棗，放在口裏，這回却在棗裏發見了核，他不禁驚奇地呌出聲來：</p>
<p>「怎麽這蜜棗裏會有核？」</p>
<p>處長並没有留心聽科長先前說的話，這時便正色說：「是蜜棗當然有核的。」　　科長還有些不大相信，他又問科員們：</p>
<p>「你們吃到了核没有？」</p>
<p>科員們更爲難了，旣不便說吃到，又不便說没有吃到。過了好一會，纔都吞吞吐吐的說：「吃到的。」</p>
<p>「吃到的，怎麽我方纔没有看見你們吐核？」似乎很爲這回答所觸怒，科長的聲口變得非常嚴重了。</p>
<p>像一個焦雷打在頭頂上，科員們不禁都相顧失色起來，覺得這回飯碗一定保不住了。其中有一個科員發了急，喉嚨頭一陣癢，乾咳了一聲，竟被他把核咳了出來。他非常開心，連忙把核從口裏取出來說：</p>
<p>「果然不愧是從香港來的金絲蜜棗，連核都和平常蜜棗不同的。」</p>
<p>其他的科員們見這一位科員竟咳出了核來，分外惶恐了，於是便大家都乾咳着，想把核咳回到口裏。</p>
<p>主人處長很奇怪，忍不住問道：</p>
<p>「怎麽今天諸位竟都犯起咳嗽來了？」</p>
<p>没有咳出核來的科員們大家都哭笑不得，勉强裝着笑容說道：</p>
<p>「大槪是因爲今天酒喝得太多了罷。「</p>
<h3 id="c257">趣喻殊 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>（十）（三）</p>
<p>蕭士瑋與錢某論妾，自謂「南中風景，大異往昔，情懷益蕭索，妄意買一妾，少資陶寫，」是可見「妾」者，是在精神感到蕭索的時候，一種「少資陶寫」的工具。可是蕭先生運氣太壞，買妾的結果，並没有得到什麽慰安。所以他接寫着：「然倉卒難於得人，不免苟且塞責，空有其累，寗復得佳味耶？」是更可見買妾也是人生的「責任，」而要費一番心力，不然，「苟且塞責，」是祇會「空有其累」的。買妾所以資口腹，到這時自然談不上「佳味。」此「陶寫，」此「運氣，」此「塞責，」此「佳味，」眞可說是趣喻中之「神品，」不僅是使我們看到前人之「娶妾觀」已也。還有，就是娶妾的滿意與否，單靠「不肯塞責，」也是不够的，得看前世修行的結果。蕭士瑋娶妾娶得「不得志，」於是轉而羡慕他人。便索興的寫道，「聞翁近得佳人，故是才子，蓋綠宿世精進，乃能獲此秀媚，以是益自咎前生修行之不得力也。」世有想在來生娶妾者乎，盍在此生努力修修也。</p>
<h3 id="c258">我詛咒你那麽一笑（七） <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 吳巖</p>
<p>雖然仍舊是不靈活的口音，但却變成急迫的懇求的語氣了。彷彿一個誠實的可愛的孩子，在大人面前要着了糖，而現出歡喜的光景在說：</p>
<p>「我丨丨我要一塊糖丨丨好吃的糖。」</p>
<p>並且Ｂoy那一個便我不高興的稱呼，也取消了。</p>
<p>我冷冷靜靜地笑了一笑，便帶着謙和的口氣，簡切地說一聲：</p>
<p>「Ａll　rightl」</p>
<p>就帶着他去找好看的姑娘去了。</p>
<p>旅客住屋的門和壁，就是全山谷人家的門和壁，都是苦竹片子編成的，第一取其缝隙多，容易通風透凉，同時也因爲遍坡遍山叢生着矮樹竹林，便於砍取，且好修造茅屋的原故。我掀開了竹笆門，乎電筒的白光，就引了我們進去。屋子裏原是用竹子做的大床，組成連問舖的様式，緊靠着竹笆子的壁頭。擺夷的男男女女，就通通亂躺在上面。不過，兩人之間總是隔有一挑雜貨担子的，彼此的身子都各有秩序地伸着，誰也不會挨擠誰的。她們都靜靜地睡着，響着甜美的酣睡的鼻音，没有一個醒了的，抬起吃驚的頭來。幸福的旅人喲，我們這兩個闖入者，要來踏碎你們的好夢了。這様歉然地想着，足步便自然而然地輕了起來。但看着這位醉了的歐洲紳士笑欣欣地咂着嘴的貪饞神情，背皮都打起冷噤來了。</p>
<p>事情已到這步田地，是無可如何的了，只有開始尋找美麗女子的工作。然而凡是遇着盤毛辮子，纒黑綢帕子的少女的頭，我就很快地把電光擺開，不讓這位饞涎欲滴的紳士瞥見，只是半帶報告半似鄙夷地說一聲。</p>
<p>Ｏld　Ｗoman</p>
<p>遇着圍有尺把高黑紗帕子的中年婦人的頭（擺夷女人大約是處於熱帶的原故吧，三十來歲的光景，便蒼老起來。）就把電光在那不十分好看的面孔上，停個一二分鐘，且使他注意地說道：</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c301">再談减租運動 <a href="#c301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— 瓊</p>
<p>這已經深感百業蕭條市面枯澀甚至慨嘆「没落」的東方第一都市「大上海」，地皮生意與房產投資到是一種獨樹一幟的繁榮事業。在此各商家用大减價買一送一以至奬劵等方法尚不能招引顧客「惠然肯來」的時候，而地價的猛漲與房租增高則莫可與京。這一特殊的事實，使我們透過大批工廠關閉與商店歇業的慘淡景象來視察，可以看到大而有許多大樓大厦大飯店的興建，小而有無數里衖邨坊的起造與翻築。就是這些嵯峨與華麗的新建築，曾經在經濟危機中烘托裝點成一個「繁榮的上海」。</p>
<p>這一外强中乾的「繁榮」，正象徵着中國農村破產天災人禍之與日俱深，與乎這國際資本列强商品銷售及投資尾閭的古國日趨殖民化。前者的結果，使許多撈錢得道而腰纒十萬的「新貴」與家擁良田千畝的「土肥」，隨帶「孔方兄」來此安全地帶的上海作「寓公」，無數的破產農民也肩着兩手到這都市來出賣勞力；而後者的影響，便造成中國工商業的衰落。不斷的内戰天災匪患，使上海人口增加，提高了房屋的需要，外貨傾銷與中國工商業衰敗的直接影響，驅使着投向生產的資本相率競買地皮購置房產。這卽是上海地價猛漲房租增高的來源。　　因此我們在上海的「繁榮」中可以看見到一種令人啼笑不得的特殊現象，中國農村愈破產，工商業愈凋敝，而上海的地價便更漲房租便更高，農村的破產，工商業的凋敝，就成了上海房產主地皮大王「正中下懷」的「民瘼」。所以有不少的「貴人」們，亦在上海競購房產，維持上海「繁榮」，努力「大上海」建設。一因一果，可謂大得治亂之道。</p>
<p>可是在這一「繁榮」之下，幾百萬買力爲生身爲房客的上海市民們，就呻吟輾轉掙扎無力了，這一片慘呌哀號之聲，聚蚊成雷，便產生了近來的减低房租運動。我們一想到月頭月尾大房東二房東要房租時追收催繳的難看面孔，以及收繳不得實行驅逐遂入捕房的毒辣，確乎如减低房租運動委員會之標語所云：「减低房租以蘇民困」正爲「上海三百萬市民渴望」的事實。而本市各團體給水木業工會的信：「血汗不敷，出以典賣，典賣旣盡，惟以身命相拚。卽不入於囹圄，亦必轉於溝壑」，直是一語道破了上海三百萬市民的苦痛。在此經濟危機浪潮激盪了整個世界的時候，减低房租雖不見能「復興市面繁榮上海」，但確乎是絶望中的貧苦市民，對「擁資自豪者」的大地主大房東勇敢而有意義的反抗。因爲我們可以說上海的一般市民與勞動者，在「度日維艱」的熬煎中，在貧困和失業的掙扎中，逐年疉增的房租，是担負中最沉重的壓榨，恐怕也是造成許多殺人與自殺種種罪惡的大原因之一罷。</p>
<h3 id="c302">人生的敵對性 <a href="#c302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— 乃碩</p>
<p>這當然是可以說的；若是人性也有好的地方，那麽我想了解與同情，當是這好的地方最好的一部分。</p>
<p>能了解當然是不會發生隔膜；而人與人之間也不會發生仇惡的意見。若是了解之外，更能同情，自是不但不會有仇惡的意見發生，而且這些人們是更會來得容易拉攏，從此則所謂人世間的互助，以及自我的犧牲精神的種種善行也就會出現在這人與人間的接觸裏了。</p>
<p>所以一般不論是老年的或是少年的有知識的人們，總認爲人類不能充分地發揮這人類的善行，無可諱言的是我們人類間最大的憾事。這，在一般有不好的妻子，或是除了妻了之外更有姨太太的人們，尤其是如此深深地感觸着。</p>
<p>本來依享樂派的哲學講，人生不外是尋求剌激。照這學派的意見加以註釋，就是人生總莫虚度，多享樂一刹那，就享受這刹那。因爲多一分享受總此没有來得充實。而若是不久便死去的話，也得容易瞑目些。於是有了妻子而弄厭了的人們，或者是弄厭了而討了姨太太的人們，總是這様的感覺着「了解」與「同情」，總得要竭力地助它發展的，不怕「了解」「同情」已充斥於人生一切細微的事物。</p>
<p>作這様想的人們，是祗因他的妻子除了她自已之外不准另搭别的女人，或是另娶姨太太的。於是而她們劇烈的阻止，劇烈的鬥駡，自然就是不了解，不同情的最高表現。而假使能够知道他們的哲學的人，而對他們這種深沉的感觸，自然也不會驚詫的。</p>
<p>本來這又何嘗不然呢？男人賺錢，女人坐食。所以女人之所以生得嬌艷，也就是備着男人玩的。而這好玩的嬌艷却又祇是短短的幾年幾月。過了這幾年，當然是比敝屣還討厭了。於是而一面　活着她，供她一些維持生命的錢物，一面自已偷偷地或是明明地到外面去找别一個女人來玩玩。或是把那玩玩的女人討做姨太太，想也是最人道的最公平的　，不是你爲甚麽不永遠地嬌艷，並且爲什麽你又不去掙錢呢？</p>
<p>然而妻子是總不可解的，不了解便總不會同情。而以這種人性中的最好的一部分被好們如此壓抑着，摧殘着，污衊着，阻撓着它的發展，自然這般有知識的先生們以爲是件莫大的憾事。</p>
<h3 id="c303">牠的了解 <a href="#c303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— 淑賢</p>
<p>她很小的時候就在一家工廠裏做工，那時她的年齡輕，知識淺，一點也看不清這喏大的社會是「白」的，「紅」的，還是「黑」的。</p>
<p>没有悲哀也没有煩惱，每天的清晨或黄昏她只是呆板地支進工和放工，整天或者整夜的將她寶貴的童年光陰葬送到那迅速轉動着的機器輪盤縫裏。</p>
<p>她一點也不天眞爛漫，她像很蠢，她的語言也來得特别地遲鈍，臉上簡直經常地看不到一點笑容，手脚的每一動作都充分地帶着一定的規律，她似乎已經變成了一部機器，肉的機器了。</p>
<p>日子她的年齡一天天同時增加着，她漸漸愛聽那些大的姊妹們在共同工作時講着詐多關於男女之間的談話，似乎這些談話很能引起她莫大的興趣，雖然其中有許多因爲年齡的關係她還不大十分明白，但那都是些神秘的謎，深深地值得她思索和想測的謎。</p>
<p>她的體質慢慢地起了異様的變化，如全身筋骨的張痛，凸起的乳房如被布緊束着似的，使她感受非常的痛苦。</p>
<p>環境不斷地給予她許多不規則的剌激，她開始愛和那些男工們胡調了，每當那男工的手在她的臉上摸一下或腿上扭一把時，她全身的血液都會騰沸，神經立時感到一種特别的不可名言的舒適。現在她已經有了「性」的要求，渴望着「肉」的安慰了！</p>
<p>那是她十五歲的時候，一個暮春的初夜，天上掛滿着無數燦爛的銀屋，微凉的春風輕柔地吹拂着，她和一個年輕的男工並着肩在一條荒僻的馬路上悄悄地慢步。當那年青的男工灼熱的手猛然握着她的手時，她立時感到一股熱氣像電流般通過她的手膀直衝到臉上，她的心忐忑的在亂跳，週身酸軟得幾乎不能移動兩條沉重的腿，如是，她索性將整個的身子緊緊地貼靠着青年男工那雄壯的左胸，依賴着，陶醉着，讓他將她緩缓地向前推進。</p>
<p>受着家庭，經濟，工作的種種支配，她不能和那年青男工美滿地去定婚，他們唯有在工作之餘暪過家庭，偷偷地支享受一時的安慰。</p>
<p>兩年之後她的體質忽然又起了一種異様的變化，腹部無故地會膨脹起來，她躭着滿腹的恐慌偷偷地去問許多比她年齡較大的姊妹們，她們告訴她已經懷妊了，這時她雖然從各方面去哀求着許多打胎的藥，但她發覺的時期過遲，一塊根深蒂固的肉終於不曾中途落下。</p>
<p>那是一個嚴冬的早上。剌骨的冷風怒吼地在刮着，她抖擻着趟在一個骯髒的弄堂的垃圾角落裏，身上只遮蓋一張破爛的麻布。</p>
<p>她現在已經不是人家的兒女了，没了父母也没了家庭，她是被社會完全忘掉和抛弃了的人，一個被禮教鐵蹄踐踏的犧牲者。</p>
<p>她慢慢地抬地起頭望望那慘灰色的天空，又低下頭看看自已高高隆起將要生產的肚皮，想着這不幸的小生命的父親，她傷心了！悔恨了！熱的眼涙如潮水般從眼眶中滴下。</p>
<p>腹部突來一陣劇痛，全身的筋骨都像在斷拆，她緊閉着眼咬緊了牙關，在暈迷中她隱約聽到一聲小兒的啼哭，她想掙扎着再打開一次眼睛，但她的前面却給無邊的黑暗遮住，她最後才了解這喏大的社會原來是「黑」的！</p>

<h3 id="c304">看報 <a href="#c304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— 令令</p>
<p>報紙業至於今日，可說是發達到了極峯的時期，有悠長歷史的大報，固不必說，卽是小報，也有小報的出路。自然囉！報章上記載着各國通電，國際大事，本埠新聞，各色各様的廣告記載着大公司的减價啊！小商店拍賣啊；犧牲血本啊！和戲院電影廣告，大書着這片子是××大明得精心傑構，那片子又××大藝人得意的代表作，哈！哈！翻來翻去在各戲院裏開演的片子，幾乎没有一張不是大明星意得精心的代表作，還有不是寫這張片子是站在勞苦大衆的立塲上說話爲勞働者而怒吼的反帝鉅片，就是這片裏有醉人的爵士歌曲，有香艷的肉感的女人的大腿，有妙齡女郎的模特兒，有美人的裸體浴丨丨丨等其他還有人們汗血腦汁的結晶的附刊增刊上的小品文字和方塊長條的啓事等等。</p>
<p>這麽記載詳細的報紙，難怪人們手執一份了。</p>
<p>靠投稿生活的文丐，像我這様的人，拿到了報紙，最要緊不過的就是先要看看有没有自已的文章發表出來，假使有的話那未就很起勁地從第一張看到末張，在新聞欄裏聚精會神地用尖銳的鼻子嗅，看會着什麽可做的材料否？假使說榜上無名的話，那就心灰意懶什麽都不願意看了。</p>
<p>最有趣的是在學校裏住讀的時候，每到星期五的晚上，每天没有人拿一拿的報紙，也算交了好運，大家都要搶着去拿來看，圖書館的六七份報，每人拿一張來看都不够。在未進圖書館以前，若有人問我們到圖書館去幹什麽？我們志是回答說：「看看國家大事。」其實眞眞的國家大事有誰去注意？所有的除了些：電影廣告公司减價外什麽都不管了這就是中學生的看報。</p>
<p>出了學校無事幹，當了個小學教師，照例是每天要看看報的。這看報原來是要掩過學生的眼，因爲做了個所謂「先王」並且在講堂上還說：「關心國事，每日看報」，因此都要機械地心裏想着别處隨便翻翻而已。</p>
<p>演員伶人之成爲「紅」，大槪是靠報紙的宣傳，因此這班人諂媚於新聞記者，當然也是成了合理的事。於是翻開報來倒先要看看有没有什麽恭維自已，爲自已捧塲的話，是不是自已白獻殷慇於記者了嗎？其他在性的煩悶中的飢渴者就拚命嚼着社會新聞版裏的關於强姦誘姦的消息。</p>
<p>報紙的發達，是尖銳地到了極端，看報的人心理，也無可韓言地是墮落了這步田地，這該去責篤誰呢。</p>
<h3 id="c305">苦笑 <a href="#c305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— 淑賢</p>
<p>大清早，天剛在亮，卽被附近工廠裏尖銳的回聲從迷惘的夢中驚醒。</p>
<p>睜開模糊的兩眼，望一望從玻璃窗外透進來的暗淡的曙光，一陣剌骨的冷風鑽過玻璃的破縫猛地吹到臉上，週身不覺打了兩個寒噤。</p>
<p>冷靜的馬路上遠遠地傳來了一聲聲清脆的談笑，悠揚地漸漸臨到窗前，突然發出幾聲可怕的呌喊。</p>
<p>「哎唷！畢三搶圍巾……」！緊張的音波傳播在冷的空中顫動得那様地可怕，我一翻身爬起了床，跑去窗前將頭靠近着玻璃，好奇地往外探看。</p>
<p>馬路的中央，朦朧的曙光包裏着兩個年青的女工和一個蘇樓不堪的老頭子，三人互相扭做一團，拉鋸戰似的在搶奪着兩條毛絨圍巾。</p>
<p>一只長方形鉛製的飯盒沉默地躺在馬路的右邊，另一只却丢到前面電柱下，從裏面發出許多冷飯和黄豆。</p>
<p>約莫兩分鐘以後，老頭子終於獲得了最後的勝利，他持着兩條毛絨圍巾慌亂地向馬路荒野的一端奔去。他　怠　的步態是那様地不穩定，長髮蓬亂的頭直鈎到胸前，擺動的雙手如像兩葉划風的漿，張大着的嘴急促地噴出一口一口的白氣，有如火車急進中的蒸氣喞筒。　　前面的十字路口偶然轉出了一羣女工。</p>
<p>「阿招！小妹！搶圍巾，相帮擋住。兩個緊緊追趕在後面的女工，怱忙地向前面的人羣招呼着。隨即那人羣迅速地擺開，將這悠長冷靜的馬路截成了兩斷。</p>
<p>有如喪家之犬的老頭子在驚愕與慌亂中一時尋不到另外的出路，他遲緩了一下脚步向四面望了一週，看看追者愈來愈近，他最後鼓起莫大的勇氣，冒險向那排列的入綫衝去。</p>
<p>那是一種自然的迅速動作，如像旋風捲塵土似於一刹那間將老頭子包裏在核心之中。</p>
<p>打聲，極憤的叱駡，雜亂的么喝，無力的哀求和着痛的慘呼，哄嚷地打成了一片。</p>
<p>工廠裏尖銳的回聲又在吹了，女工們如被命令似的自動遣散着。</p>
<p>馬路的十字口，嫩弱的曙光之下，孤單地躺着那襤褸的老頭子在呻吟和爭扎，他那深陷的兩眼含滿了熱涙。</p>
<p>「老人家！這大的年紀還幹這種營生」丨牆角邊轉出了一個年老的女工，向這可憐的負傷者投了一道憐憫的眼光之後，善意地輕聲間着。</p>
<p>「老媽媽丨呌我有什麽辦法呢？兒子出去當兵給土匪剿了，媳婦僅僅賣了三十塊錢，自已年老了兩年來找不到生活做，如今老女人病了十來天不曾起過一下床，我還是昨天早上吃過一碗稀粥的！在這歲尾年頭，呌我怎能活下去！……」。他含着涙很費力地回答着她，咳着嗽，喘息做一團，</p>
<p>老年的女工不曾回答他，只默默地摇了摇頭，凄凉地嘆了兩聲冷氣依然行去。</p>
<p>猛然一陣冷風將他的長髮吹覆額前，他全身拦擻着慢慢的站了起來，望一望那迎風走去的老年女工的背影，他深深地感到，在這茫茫的人海之中掙扎了幾十年來的他，只有她，才是他唯一的眞正同情者，如是，他的嘴角微微地浮現了一絲苦笑。</p>

<p>『幸虧老天保佑。今天林姨處我已去過了，她說明天我就可進廠去上工了。』當王二幹完了他一天工作回到家裏來的時候，他的妻流露出欣喜的神色，開口就着先把這個消息報告他。</p>
<p>『啊！幸虧得老天保佑，到上海半年了。你如果再找不到工作的話，那靠我每天三角錢的進欵生活，再也不能維持下去了』王二聽了他妻子的話以後，也發出似歡悅似嘆息的話來。</p>
<p>不知怎様的，歡躍的空氣，充滿着這間破舊而陰黯的小屋子裏；那桌上螢螢的煤油燈，火焰也格外覺得光亮了許多，好像在意匠到光明之神漸漸地將降臨到這小屋子裏來似的。牆壁上剝落的石灰和破碎的紙屑，被門縫裏吹進來的微風奏起快樂之曲。總之，這小屋子裏一切的一切，都漫滿着有生氣活躍的氣象。</p>
<p>王二和他的妻子本來是鄉間的農人。因爲連年氷災和歉收的結果，使他們漸漸兒到了不能立足鄉間的地步。去年雖說是豐年，但是榖價竟跌到不能抵本，他們不得不向繁華的都市裏求生活。　　光陰如流水般的過去。他們倆到上海已三個月了。充滿着勢利社會的上海，那裏有他們的出路呢。並且二個人肚子倒是一天天要吃下去的。住的雖說是那些短矮而陰黯的破屋，可是每月也要出一元大洋的房租。生活的鞭搥迫得他没法可　了，不得不　　住在隔壁的　小子的介紹，忍着飢寒去幹那往日風打日晒每天拿三角錢的敲馬路石子的工作。但是啊，三角錢一天的進欵，依然是不能解决他們二個人日常生活的。</p>
<p>王二的妻子千方百計託了擺蔬菜灘的王媽介紹，並且把鄉間帶來比較精緻些的一包衣服，去當押來十元錢，作了孝敬費，才得到林姨的垂青；答應她在她工作廠中設法弄到了一塊牌子，明天就可上工了。因爲林姨是附近某橡膠廠中的女工頭。據她常聽到王媽說：在橡膠廠裏作女工，每月進欵十數元錢是不算多的。祇要你孝敬費化得多一些的話，無論是生手熟手，林姨是都可保險介紹進去的。</p>
<p>進廠的第一天，她由林姨領到一個熟手女工處學習；就是由她相帮這熟手女工作工，製成品的工資，是算林姨的。林姨對她說：因爲她是生手，須要學習了二個得期後，才能正式自已得到工資。</p>
<p>二星期後的一個早晨。當她到廠進工塲去的時候，林姨忽然過來對她說：『今天早晨監工王先生通告：因爲廠方近日營業不振，銷路呆滯。暫時要將生手和工作不良的工人裁去。你也是被裁之一，所以從今天起，你可不必來工作了！』她聽了這話，眼前覺得一陣昏暗。</p>
<p>是傍晚的時候了，王二散了工回到那間陰黯的屋子裏，眼看見他的妻依伏在破桌邊嗚嗚咽咽的哭着，他不禁呆住了。那血一様的憤怒之火，急然在他的腹中赤烈烈地燃燒起來了。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我前由友人介紹，聘定朱姓女爲室，結婚已有數年。雙方感情不洽，致我幸福喪失。我是在外經商的，刻下有第三者與我願訂白頭偕老之約。查第三者已許與張姓，與我結婚未知要受法律之禁止否？我是一個商人，無力負擔二處家務開支。我想與髮妻不經法律手續，私人面談，立離婚據，各執一紙，然後我再與第三者結婚，但未知法律有否拘束？故特冒昧來字，懇求先生勞神在報端明示解答，此頌</p>
<p>撰安　李雄森謹上</p>
<p>編者按：李君所詢的問題有兩個要點：第一，與人訂過婚的女子，可否再與他人訂婚；第二，離婚可否不經法律</p>
<p>手續，由雙方恊議。第二點當然不生什麽問題，因法律上原規定有「自願離婚」。（參看本信箱二月十日「離婚爲什麽會發生困難？」）但自願離婚以雙方同意爲先决問題。這是李君所應注意的，此外，自願離婚並應以書面爲之，並有二人以上證人之簽名。第一個問題，就較爲複雜，因爲與人訂過婚的女子，在原婚約未解除前，是不應再與他人訂婚的。然而婚約是契約之定種，它的效力，並不十分强大，縱當事人一方違約，他方也祇能爲損害賠償之請求，而不能請求法院强制執行。所以「第三者」也不是絶對不能與李君結婚，不過最好還是先讓「第三者」與張姓解除原婚約。（關於解除婚約，本信箱近來常有討論，李君及讀者可覆按也，兹不多贅，）</p>

<p>用着如同老人看慣男女關係的眼睛，徐三看他燒。細短的鐵籤上挑着瓜子般的一粒，在火頭上轉動着，忽而脹大，忽而冐出一縷水汽，於是在左手的爲指尖上　着，如是地做了上十遍，黑粒在火頭上黏到斗孔上去了。援出了針，把黑粒在火頭上燒着捺緊，又把烟籤燒熱。戳一個小洞在斗孔上，於是趙管事像猛然想起了什麽似地忽然欠起身體向坐地單上徐三旁邊說着話的蘇八說，</p>
<p>「老八，你來一口。燒好了，現成的。」</p>
<p>「得罪你。我不要，趙先生。我吃過了。」</p>
<p>「你來，一様，現成的。」趙管賬由欠而坐了。</p>
<p>「實在，不，趙先生，你請曹先生來吧。」</p>
<p>謙讓了好久的曹先生才接住了槍，向徐三說，「老三，你……」</p>
<p>「不，曹先生，你來吧。」徐三連忙推謝了。</p>

<p>— 密齊</p>
<p>大家都知道，喬治賴甫德（Ｇeorge　Ｒaft），在銀幕上是位最能轟動女性的明星。有許多人說他的面貎。有些像已故的墨</p>
<p>Ｒudolph　Ｖalentino），因此他更爲女性們所崇拜了。他在纽約度舞台生活的時候，他的戲院天天擠滿了女性，將他前後包圍着，使他不得不走後門偷出偷入。但他却是一個最怕女人的明星。有一位好萊塢的記者，最近和他得了一次談話，他倒毫不規避的，公開陳述了許多他對於女子的意見，以及他所以敬畏女子不敢相近的理由。下面就是一些。</p>
<p>他說：「就是從小就怕女人的。這亦不僅是我一個人如此，許多好萊塢的明星們都如此，因爲女子們當中，具有野性的，隨時想敲竹槓。訛取金錢的，實在太多了。」以上是他的胆大話。有人說他不應當公開說這種話，侮辱女性，因爲他自已明星的地位如何得到的……還不是一大半靠女人們的沉迷於他的相貌表演，而拚命地捧他嗎？喬治賴甫德至今尚未娶妻。但他亦不獨居，因爲他不敢獨居，他總有一個男伴和他同居的。他出去的時候，他亦總有一位男伴，好像保鏢似的跟着不離左右。在好萊塢很少有人看見他帶了女人一同出去的。有的，祇有一個馬嬌麗金（Ｍarjorie　Ｋing）。爲什麽他不怕馬嬌麗呢？因爲他對於她是有嫁娶的凖備的。他和她的婚期，雖然還没有公佈，但他們遲早之間，必定可以成爲夫妻的。</p>
<p>喬治賴甫德半生的經騐，關於女人的，實在太多而太驚奇，以致使他天然具有的對於女子的情感，都鎖磨迨盡了。他說：「現在好萊塢賴婚或是遺棄的訴訟，實在風行一時得和綁票差不多了。無論什麽明星，他隨時隨地都有被人陷害的可能。不久以前，我給了一個女子兩千塊金元，其實我在什麽地方和她會過的，我都記不清。那時我剛拍完一張片子，并且和公司還有糾葛，所以我雖然明知，要是我和那個女郎對薄公庭，我一定可以勝訴但是我亦不願和她打官司。我第一怕報紙的宣傳，弄壞了我的聲名，所以就和她私了了。但是倘使我不是個電影明星，那我就要對她不起了。但是話又說回來了，要是我不是電影明星，那個女子亦不來轉我金錢的念頭了。她們實在看着做電影明星的，個個都是容易被恫嚇敲詐的『好户頭』了。</p>
<p>「那個女子還有一個理由，爲什麽要來敲詐。她來到了好萊塢，没有法子顯露她的名氣。她想要是她的名字，和我的合在一起，在各報上用大字登載一下，她就可以一舉而成名了。但是我比她還要聰明，我始終没有將她的名字，告訴新聞記者，而她自已亦有所畏懼，不敢自行宣佈，怕眞的打起官司來。因此，她的計劃就除了拿到少許金錢之外，大部份失敗了。」（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c310">評「華清春暖」 <a href="#c310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— 亞夫</p>
<p>ＦootlightＰarade—國泰</p>
<p>繼「四十二號街」和「歌舞昇平」之後，華納兄弟公司又有了這「華清春暖」。</p>
<p>差不多每一部歌舞影片都是一様，一個故事常居於次要的地位，似乎是故事的穿揷，無非是爲了幾塲歌舞的演出。同様，「華清春暖」也是如此，其中除了歌舞塲面之外，不過是一個平庸的故事。我們幾乎想像得出，愛情，男女間的糾紛，甚至於當我們看到那一女書記和康德要好時，不管他雖然愛上了薇薇，到後來一定是和女書記結婚，這是用不着先行讀一遍說明書的。</p>
<p>在這裏劇作者最注意了的便是强調了康德的藝術觀。和薇亞一様，舞台人終於得從事於舞台藝術，而失業了的導演到底在極度努力之下而成名。不是嗎？當他憤然離開公司不與戈特等合作，而在街頭塗了廣告上之自已的名字的時候，他忽然看到一君黑人孩子沐浴，立刻犧牲他的成見，而極力挽救那埀敗的成功。</p>
<p>的確，我們不會忽視，康德是失業的不幸的天才戲劇家，他自已得了别人的資助從事於自已的事業，同時也救濟了幾百的失業了的舞女。假使他放棄了自身之職位，不是再使那些舞女失業嗎？救了自已也救濟了别人，這便是復興運動之主義。加之最後還有一塲歌頌藍鷹運動之歌舞塲面，更足以證明這一影片的主旨是響應羅斯福總統的復興運動了。所以，在一些無味的愛情穿揷之外，我們還得如此理解。</p>
<p>就故事的編撰來說，乃是不像「四十二號街」那般嚴肅的。然而就歌舞的塲面來說，不僅是超越了「四十二號街，而且比之「歌舞昇平」亦更見華麗偉大。僅就這一方面說，那無疑的是美國空前的歌舞片。聯藝的「百老匯之秘密」，或派拉蒙的「坐花醉月」，更是望塵莫及　　燦爛華麗，極盡美國影片之奢侈豪華。</p>
<p>這裏一共是四塲歌舞。第一次是貓之羣，已經是别出心裁的奇特。第二次是大旅館，比第一次更見繁重。第三次是最精采的一齣了，成羣的女人在水中舞蹈。利用了攝影機所有的技巧，顯示了資本主義影片式誇大最尖端的表示。第四次是歌頌藍鷹運動的塲面，在一塲大打之後，將人體擺成了一座鷹徽。</p>
<p>關於這方面有兩點很值得我們注意</p>
<p>（一）一般的銀幕上的舞台劇，仍然顧及了舞台之固定的地位。雖然利用了攝影之特殊技能使其電影化，但整個的仍拘束於舞台的位置。如「四十二號街」或「歌舞昇平」都是如此。但是這裏却突出了舞台的範圍，完全成爲電影的歌舞。除了第一次之外，其餘三次全是電影的時間和空間。尤其是第三次，自山上到水池，自水裏到噴水台，完全是舞臺上所不能做到的電影方法。</p>
<p>（二）一般的歌舞片，都是將最大的塲面擺在最後，以留給觀衆輕鬆快樂的印象。但是這裏却不如此，除了第一次在故事本身之前便出現了以外，到故事完全了結之後，便是接着來三齣。而其中最熱鬧的第三次的那一塲，却不擺在最後，相反的，和「歌舞昇平」一様，將那牽涉意義的放在最後，給人們一種嚴肅的剌激。「歌舞昇平」最後一塲救濟失業者，這裏是歌頌藍鷹運動。在比重上也許後者不及前者，但無論如何，二者都不會給人十分快感的。據說「歌舞昇平」的導演，爲了將那救濟失業的一塲之處置問題，和公司當局爭持許久，結果是勝利的擺在最後。這是藝術家不肯完全趨奉觀衆之習慣的地方。當然，「清華春暖」也是如此，也值得我們注意。</p>
<p>此外，没有什麽可說的了。不管導演Ｌloyd　Ｂacon對於整個的調子都把握住了快的旋律，不管他對於歌舞以外的塲面都還支配適當，然而到底是除了歌舞之外没有什麽可看的吧。自然，這是一部美國空前偉大的歌舞影片。也是資本主義影片之典型。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c311">觀「歸來」的感想 <a href="#c311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— 克心</p>
<p>一個藝術作品，在内容上顯得空虚或貧弱時，那怕作者在形式上或技術上怎様去考究，終竟是難以緊緊地抓着觀衆的心，給予深刻印象的。「歸來」這個影片，就是一個實例。它的取材的平庸陳舊，並且還没有充分的眞實性；意旨的不深入；結構的俗套，使宅陷入貧弱空虚的境地。可是導演者對於這樣一個平凡簡單的故事，能從那些小節上去處理來使觀衆並不覺得沉悶，這倒是相當成功的地方。不過關於製景，燈光及演員們的有些表現的不充分，這不能不說是導演者的忽略。</p>
<p>銀幕上的表現，當然應以演員爲中心，那裝置不但不應妨害演員的動作；表現，並且還應對於演員的動作，表現有帮助，就好比圖畫中的拱雲托月那様，雲不但不妨害月，並且還助成月的題現格外清楚。在這點上，銀幕是有點與舞類似的。我們要是站在這様的觀點上來看「歸來」的製景，有些地方是有缺點的，最顯著是别墅裏那間客廳（？），陳列了那麽多古玩，在那裏排成了一個大牌坊似的東西，因爲它在那畫面上所占的空間之大，及它之零碎，分散了觀衆的注意力，使觀衆的視線不能充分地集中在那個塲面中的演員的動作上；這様不但對演員没有帮助，並且還有妨碍。這様的缺點，不僅是「歸來」中才有，其他好些中國影片和外國影片都是常有的。</p>
<p>關於燈光，我們都知道，它的作用不僅是照見東西，並且還有游發情緒，造出氣氛的效力，我們如利用得好，對於表現上是有很大的帮助的；否則，就會失其效能，並破壞劇中的情調。如「歸來」中的鑑兒臥病，其母在外偷視一塲的光，仍與平常那様强硬，這是與那種塲面的情調不調和的。要是把那光變得柔軟點，甚至清冷點，豈不就把那個塲面應有的氣分造出來，完成一幅很調和，更動人的畫面來了嗎？（下略）</p>
<h3 id="c312">評「一個女明星」 <a href="#c312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>— 綠意</p>
<p>李片的結束，是一個最大缺點，柳絲旣因受到了玩弄而覺悟了，那末，儘可以讓她去尋找光明之路，爲什麽要她重要前夫的舊居去受一番落呢？這奚落是柳絲應該受的嗎？這不幸事件的造成並不是柳絲的過失，環境如不逼得秋霜欠債，他們家庭經濟如能寛裕，柳絲是决不會墮落到如此地步的。</p>
<p>但是，暴露一個玩弄女性的資產階級和一個拍馬吹牛的幇閒階級倒相當地做到了。蹂躪女性是資產階級的本色，他手裏有的是錢，在這個有錢能使鬼推磨的現社會裏，何况一個意志薄弱的女子。有了有閒階級，當然還有幫閒階級，本片裏的周雲屏就是一例。但是，他要拍馬，他要吹牛，也就是爲的是錢啊！因此，何公哲這種人是可惡；周雲屏這種人是可憐。　　何公哲妻的出塲是不必的。也把她寫得太不近情理了。她見丈夫帶了一個女子進來同住，她非但不反對，還像用人一様供她驅策，卽使羔羊，受到痛苦時也要呌幾聲的，何况是人　　現在我們要提到胡珊富有肉感的一幕，這就是所謂「犧牲色相」。我眞不明白，製作者爲什麽不把完整的内容來供獻觀衆，而拿女人的肉體來吸引觀衆呢？或曰：這也是爲了「錢」啊！我默然，我無言。</p>

<p>— 笏臣</p>
<p>停了一停，麥格納斯調轉話頭道：「陛下今天容光煥發，眞是以前所未見的美麗。」克利斯丁娜道：「麥格納斯，我謝謝你對於我容貌上的一切稱讚，因爲你是善於對付女人的專家呀。」麥格納斯道：「陛下的恩寵，眞是隆重極了，但是這麽隆重的恩運，没有温暖到我的内心。你所賜給我的，不過是些零得粒屑，面整個的確已預留給别人了。」克利斯丁娜脚步動了。她很不耐煩似的對着麥格納斯道：「來格納斯，你到底尋根問底，想知道些什麽？」突然間麥格納斯將她緊緊地抱住了。克利斯丁娜很命地掙扎着，將他推開了，但是他的嘴唇已經在她的粉頸上擦了一下。他們於是大家站視眈眈地互相看着，心裏已存了仇視之心。一回兒她急速地走開了。</p>
<p>那天宫裏開了一個大宴會，歡迎新到任的西班牙大使，高級軍官們穿了全副戎裝，内閣大臣們着了大禮服，貴婦們亦都「個一個打扮得花枝招展，珠圍翠繞，女王克利斯丁娜駕到了，音樂臺上奏着織細的音樂。她端坐在寶座上，寶座的上面還綴着一個雛型的瑞典王冠。她芳心卜卜地跳蕩着，因爲再過了一霎時的光陰，那位西班牙的少年欽差，就要發現在她的面前了。一回兒大禮官高聲地宣誦着西班牙欽差的全部名字官銜。碩大的宫門開了，音樂臺上又奏起西班牙的國歌。安東尼歐大使在皇室拱衛軍敬禮之下，很快步地走進了大廣廳，後面跟着一班衣裳着得極其煊　的僚屬侍從等等。等到他走近了寶座，克利斯丁娜的呼吸都短促了，但她還能够想象他應當怎様地驚駭，應當是快活的驚駭。那位大使向前走着，在他面前的，本來祇是一片彩爛的光輝。就是寶座下端坐着的女王，亦好像一尊金碧輝煌的神聖，不敢平視，所以他走近了，祇略爲一看，就屈了一膝，跪了下去，頭低垂着表示服從尊敬之意。不意寶座上的女王開口了。她說：「今日歡迎貴大使來到敝國宫廷不勝榮幸之至」。</p>
<p>大安東尼歐覺得那聲音非常耳熟，連忙抬起頭來，祇才見上面坐的女王，就是日前道上遇見的女王。他一時驚慌起來，不知所措。他亦記了起來，祇是屈着膝，疵疵地看着。一回兒那女王繼續說：「請貴大使轉爲致謝貴國君王，能派遣像閣下的人物，充使敝國，實係無上的光榮」旁邊站着的度支大臣麥格納斯，虎視耽耽的從大使看到女王，從女王看到大使。首相奥森斯提那故意咳了一聲嗽，安東尼歐才猛然間覺得失儀，立即站了起來。他雖極自鎭攝，但已經覺得惶惶然不知說什麽話才好。（未完）</p>

<p>Sun Has Not Replied to Pang, Etc.</p>
<p>Jin-Sui Troops Head West in Succession</p>
<p>Fu Zuoyi Banquets the Military Sub-Committee Members to Discuss Military Affairs</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military preparations have been made to deal with Sun's troops. However, Pang Bingxun, Hu Boxiang and others jointly telegraphed Sun to make a final appeal, but no reply has been received in Beiping as of noon today. It is difficult to predict the outcome. Fu Zuoyi will leave Beiping after attending the regular meeting of the Military Sub-Committee tomorrow. Outside reports that something has happened in Ningxia have been investigated and proven untrue by various parties. This morning, officials received a telegram from Ningxia urging Fu Zuoyi to return to Suiyuan as soon as possible to supervise the troops and coordinate the suppression. Currently, Sun's army is concentrating its forces to fiercely attack Pingluo again. Ma Baolin's troops inside the city are putting up a valiant resistance, and the fighting is extremely fierce. There have been minor skirmishes in the vicinity of Ningxia's new city in recent days. Sun himself is traveling back and forth between the Great and Small Mosques to direct the operations. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Guihua states that Fu's entourage telegraphed Suiyuan stating that Fu is expected to return to Suiyuan from Beiping around the 21st. The Jin-Sui troops suppressing Sun's troops will advance on multiple routes after Fu returns to Suiyuan. The Jin-Sui troops under Wang Jingguo, Shi Shuhai, Wang Deying, two brigades, and Zhao Chengshou's cavalry artillery have all arrived at Linhe. The subsequent troops will be Wang Shuan's cavalry division, which is also preparing to move out. Wang himself has gone to Suiyuan to meet with Wang Jingguo. The Dong and Zhang brigades of Fu's troops began to move west in succession today. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Jin-Sui army has completed all preparations. Fu Zuoyi will return to Suiyuan to direct military affairs after receiving the funds. Fu held a banquet for the members of the Military Sub-Committee this afternoon to discuss the handling of affairs. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying has not yet replied to the telegram from Pang and others. A peaceful resolution is feared to remain an illusion in the short term. Among the Jin-Sui troops being dispatched, Zhao Chengshou's cavalry has arrived in Linhe. Zhao himself has arrived in Suiyuan and will proceed to Baotou after a short stay to arrange everything in Linhe. Due to the lack of vehicles for transporting the infantry and artillery after passing Baotou, the dispatch is slightly delayed. All Jin troops departing from Suiyuan will temporarily concentrate in Linhe, awaiting orders to advance west. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi stated that issues such as salaries are no longer a problem. After returning to Suiyuan, he is determined to concentrate all the troops moving west within a week. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese and Korean Rogues Act Rampantly</p>
<p>Police Maintain Order with Bare Hands</p>
<p>(Beiping) After our side took over Shanhaiguan County, the area is relatively calm. However, Japanese and Korean rogues rely on their power to act recklessly, engaging in various forms of intimidation against shops and residents. Scattered bandits suddenly appeared in a certain area north of the city, fleeing from outside the pass and causing trouble everywhere. Because the Shanhaiguan police are maintaining local security with bare hands, merchants and civilians feel apprehensive. The Japanese have not yet prepared to return the telegraph and post offices they occupy in Shanhaiguan. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong said that the local situation in Shanhaiguan is peaceful after the takeover. Yuan Tai, the magistrate of Linyu County, came to Beiping today to see Yu and report on the takeover process. The puppet organizations and some Japanese soldiers in Shanhaiguan have not yet withdrawn. After further negotiations, it is hoped that they will all be withdrawn. Regarding the Yutian security team incident, after Hu Xiewu was killed, if Sun Peilin, who they elected as his successor, can comply with the provincial order to reduce the unit to its original strength of 1,000 and has the ability to lead, the provincial government may consider his request and observe the situation.

<p>(Beiping) After the takeover of the counties in the war zone, postal service to Gubeikou has not yet been restored. Our mail only reaches Shixia, and Japanese mail only reaches Gubeikou. The Beiping Post Office once sent personnel to negotiate, but without result. Now, the Post Office has sent Liu Zian to handle the matter, and postal service is now in operation. The regulations are as follows: The puppet national post office still exists. We have set up another post office in Gubeikou. Inland mail can reach Gubeikou.

<h3 id="e13">The Perpetrators of the Plot to Assassinate Ma Zhanshan are Detained in the Tianjin Public Security Bureau <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The perpetrators of the plot to assassinate Ma Zhanshan were apprehended by the Public Security Bureau in conjunction with the British Municipal Council a few days ago. Except for the bandit Ma Debiao, who resisted arrest and was killed, the remaining bandits, Zheng Yufu, Xue Xiancai, Wang Chengyu, and He Yuqing, and the female bandit Gao Li, along with the confiscated automatic rifles, bullets, and bombs, were extradited by the British Municipal Council to the Provincial Public Security Bureau at 10:00 AM on the 20th. After the Special Operations Team of the bureau inquired about their names and brief situation, they were detained. Their plan was to first move into the vicinity of Ma Zhanshan's residence in the British Concession and then carry out the assassination. However, they were apprehended and injured on the way to their new residence before they could move in. It is reported that Ma and others have committed many crimes in Tianjin. The recent assassination case in the press was also committed by them. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The plot to assassinate Ma Zhanshan and Ma Dianchen, who is already dead, was arranged by a man named De Biao, who was introduced to a special service agency of a certain country in Tianjin two months ago by a man named Zhu. He received weapons and ammunition and set up the Iron-Blood Assassination Group at No. 43 Yangzhi Lane in the Japanese Concession. They planned to assassinate figures and receive awards according to the target, with awards ranging from 20,000 to 100,000 yuan. Ma served as the chief of the military medical office in Zhang Jingyao's army in 1927, then as brigade commander, and later as chief of the logistics station for Chu Yupu's Zhili-Shandong Allied Army, committing many evils. He was twice wanted. Last year, when "Old Mouse" caused chaos in eastern Hebei, Ma served as its political commissar. He then became disillusioned and returned to Tianjin. Recently, he willingly submitted to enemy control. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

I originally intended to take office in Wuhan immediately, but I was unable to do so due to circumstances. Now that everything is settled and the military situation in the front line of bandit suppression is important, I came to Nanjing from Shanghai last night to seek instructions from the central government on everything. I will take office in Wuhan within the next few days and plan to go to various areas of Henan and Hubei to inspect the bandit situation on the ground, then go to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang Kai-shek to formulate a plan for bandit suppression. As for whether or not to transfer Northeast troops, it has not yet been determined. It will be decided after this inspection of the bandit situation. I have many private matters in Tianjin that need to be taken care of, and I originally planned to return to Tianjin on this trip, but due to time constraints, I was unable to do so. It is not yet possible to predict whether I will be able to go there this time." (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e17">The Panchen Lama Assumes the Position of National Government Commissioner <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The Central Government Sends Ye Chucang to Supervise the Oath-Taking Ceremony</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Panchen Lama took the oath to assume the position of National Government Commissioner at the National Government Auditorium at 10:00 AM on the 20th. Dai Chuanxian, Niu Yongjian, Ye Chucang, Zhao Wailian, Chen Qicai, He Yaozu, Huang Musong, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, Chu Minyi, Chen Daqi, and representatives from various ministries and commissions, totaling more than 600 people, attended the ceremony. Dai Chuanxian led the ceremony, and the Central Government sent Ye Chucang to supervise the oath-taking ceremony and deliver an address, which stated that the Panchen Lama assumed the work of saving the country and the people with a compassionate Buddhist heart, and that the Central Government colleagues had deep respect for the Panchen Lama's virtue and conduct. This time, the Central Government invited him to serve as a member of the National Government, which could assist the Central Government and consolidate the borders. Chairman Lin's address stated that the Panchen Lama's morality and teachings were admired throughout the country, and that he was pleased to invite him to serve as a member of the National Government. The Central Government was particularly concerned about the border areas and hoped that the Panchen Lama would embrace the borders and promote the intentions of the Central Government, so that they could jointly assist the Central Government. The Panchen Lama had already made outstanding efforts in exhorting the various leagues and banners of Mongolia during his tour of Xuanhua, and the government deeply entrusted him. At the end, the Panchen Lama gave a reply speech, which stated, "For generations, the Panchen Lamas have been treated with courtesy by the state, and have always been committed to spreading the teachings of the Buddha and upholding the laws of the state, to enlighten and benefit all living beings. Fortunately, with the blessings of the Three Jewels and the protection of the Four Graces, we have been able to fulfill our duties without fail for more than 500 years. The sincerity of my gratitude cannot be expressed in words. Over the past few years, the Panchen Lama has repeatedly received preferential treatment from the government, and this time I have been selected by the Central Government to serve as a member of the National Government. In the future, I will do my best to uphold the General's heart of serving the world, promote his doctrine, and spread the Dharma, so as to assist in the unification of the country, build the happiness of the people, and promote world peace. I hope that the central government officials, comrades, and all monks and laypeople in the country will show more love and kindness, and provide timely teachings. I respectfully wish the Republic of China long life, the people health and happiness, the Chairman good health, and all government colleagues all the best." (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Since the quelling of the rebellion in Fujian, there has been widespread speculation that the central government intends to expand military aviation in Fuzhou and Xiamen, leading to various conjectures. Recently, Chairman Wang of the Executive Yuan made a statement to reporters from the Central News Agency, saying that regarding the Fujian airfield, he had just received a telegram from Chairman Chen replying that the original scale of the Fuzhou airfield was too small, making it inconvenient for bandit suppression and civilian transportation, so it was slightly expanded to meet the needs. The Xiamen airfield not only has too small an area, but also has high mountain obstacles, so it is necessary to find another location. It can be seen that all kinds of speculation are purely groundless. As for the Shanghai-Guangdong airline, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Transportation has already made a statement explaining the truth. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Zhu Jiaqi Makes a Solemn Statement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When asked by reporters on the 20th about the China National Aviation Corporation's operation of the Shanghai-Guangdong route, Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiaqi immediately made the following solemn statement, saying that the Ministry had long urged the China National Aviation Corporation to open the Shanghai-Guangdong route as soon as possible. Due to financial difficulties, it had been delayed repeatedly. Recently, the China National Aviation Corporation reached an agreement with the US-Pacific Company to advance funds, provide aircraft, and assist with technical personnel. It was officially opened on October 24th last year. All management responsibilities are still entirely the responsibility of the China National Aviation Corporation, which is the same as the Shanghai-Beiping and Shanghai-Sichuan routes. Both the China National Aviation Corporation and the Eurasia Aviation Corporation are commercial companies, and their operations are limited to civil aviation. Since the Ministry holds a large portion of the shares, all management is also subject to the Ministry's strict supervision. Shanghai and Guangdong are the most prosperous commercial cities, so the need for the Shanghai-Guangdong route is also the most pressing. Therefore, the China National Aviation Corporation advanced funds from the US-Pacific Company to borrow aircraft to open the route for civilian use. Its nature is purely commercial, and it is no different from other airline routes. Zhu also replied to reporters' questions about the China National Aviation Corporation's plan to cooperate with Hong Kong to establish a state-owned joint transportation, saying that the matter is not yet under discussion.

<h3 id="e24">The International Difficulties of the German-Austrian Merger <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The recent Austrian incident has caused anxiety among countries such as France and Italy, fearing it might lead to a disguised merger between Germany and Austria, disrupting the balance of power in Europe. We already mentioned this yesterday. However, a German-Austrian merger faces numerous difficulties and is impossible without forcibly tearing up the post-World War I treaties.</p>
<p>Some argue that for the resurgence of Germany's national fortunes, the most urgent priority is to unite all Germanic peoples. Among Germanic peoples outside Germany, the most numerous reside in present-day Austria. Therefore, a German-Austrian merger is a necessary tactic to promote Pan-Germanism. If it becomes a reality, most of the shackles imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles can be removed, and Germany's land and population will be restored to pre-war levels. Then, the eastward movement initiated before the war might have a chance of success.</p>
<p>Such are the aspirations of the Germans. If they could achieve their wishes, they would inevitably reshape the map of Europe today, triggering a second world war. Its peaceful success is unlikely. France, Germany's historical enemy, will certainly do its utmost to hinder Germany's resurgence to avoid any hidden dangers in the east. Secondly, Italy opposes the German-Austrian merger. If the merger is achieved, the buffer zone between Germany and Italy will be completely removed, subsequently endangering Italy's hegemony in the Adriatic Sea and the development of the Balkan Peninsula, the consequences of which are unpredictable. Moreover, after the war, Italy seized Austria's southern territories, incorporating 250,000 local Germans. If Germany and Austria merge, the flames of Pan-Germanism will become irresistible. These 250,000 Germans will inevitably rise up to seek liberation from foreign subjugation and allegiance to Germany. This issue of ethnic minorities is also a major concern for the Italians and cannot be ignored. Thirdly, there is Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia is located north of present-day Austria, and its western part penetrates into German territory. If Germany and Austria merge, Czechoslovakia would be surrounded by Germany on three sides. In addition, Czechoslovakia currently has 3.2 million Germans, and its fear of Pan-Germanism far exceeds that of Italy. As for Poland, although it has a ten-year non-aggression pact with Germany, it has over 2 million Germans within its borders. Therefore, it should also have similar concerns about the German-Austrian merger. Among European countries, only Britain, which does not have significant conflicts of interest with Germany, is more sympathetic to Germany. However, Britain is also a signatory to the Treaty of Versailles and is unlikely to ignore France's request to jointly uphold the treaty. Furthermore, since Hitler came to power, his various actions have been violent and arbitrary, greatly undermining British goodwill. Therefore, its attitude towards the Austrian incident is also consistent with that of France and Italy.</p>
<p>Given so many international difficulties, Hitler of Germany has only two paths to take. One is unconditional surrender, and the other is to overcome all difficulties and seize power in Austria. According to recent foreign news, the German Social Party has already demanded that the Austrian Prime Minister resign automatically. It is clear which path they are taking. What we can foresee here is that Austrian chaos may recur. At that time, France, Italy, and other countries will also take effective measures to fulfill their long-standing desire to maintain Austria's independence. If so, the clouds of war will reappear in Europe. We shall wait and see.</p>

<p>Brussels: The funeral of the late King of Belgium is scheduled to be held in this church on Thursday. The coffin will be placed in the church and then moved to the Laeken Royal Palace for burial.

Up to ten thousand people have signed the condolence book at the palace, and the stream continues late into the night. (Guomin News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Brussels: When the remains of the King of Belgium were moved from the Laeken Royal Palace in the suburbs to the Royal Palace in the capital yesterday, more than one hundred thousand Belgians stood silently by the roadside, expressing their deep sorrow. The King's coffin was covered with the Belgian flag and carried on a gun carriage, with six people carrying torches leading the way. The Belgian Crown Prince and his brother, Prince Charles, followed the carriage in military uniforms, followed by veterans and representatives of various organizations. The Crown Prince is scheduled to be sworn in on Friday and has now been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General. The Belgian Royal Family has announced a six-month mourning period. At the King's burial, four Crown Princes of European kingdoms will represent their fathers in attending the funeral, namely the Crown Prince of Italy, the Crown Prince of Britain, the Crown Prince of Norway, and the Crown Prince of Sweden. The King of Bulgaria and the King of Siam, who are currently touring Europe, will both personally attend the funeral. The Queen of the Netherlands will be represented by her husband, the King of Romania by his brother, Prince Nicholas, and the King of Denmark by his son.</p>
<p>Since the death of the King of Belgium, members of the Royal Family have been visiting the Queen. The British Emperor has dispatched Admiral Keyes, commander of the British fleet, to accompany the British Crown Prince to Belgium. If the weather is good, the British Crown Prince and Keyes will travel by plane. When the House of Commons met yesterday afternoon, the Speaker and others were in mourning. After the question time in the House of Commons, Prime Minister MacDonald made a speech, stating that the British people were deeply saddened by the news of the death of the King of Belgium and believed that the members of Parliament would wish to express their condolences to the Belgian Royal Family and people. The Prime Minister then announced that he would propose a motion tomorrow calling on the British Emperor to send a telegram to the new King of Belgium expressing the House of Commons' deep condolences to the Belgian Royal Family and people. The House of Commons usually makes such a proposal when the head of a friendly country passes away, and the House of Lords will follow suit. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi returned to Beijing in the same car with Zhang Xueliang this morning. According to those around Kong, in order to make up for the lack of finances and hoping to tide over the difficulties, Kong had discussed with the Shanghai banking community borrowing a new loan of 44 million yuan with the Italian Boxer Indemnity as collateral. Then, issuing new treasury bonds of over 40 million yuan with the Italian Boxer Indemnity as collateral is a misunderstanding of the rumors. The so-called new treasury bonds were proposed by the Shanghai banking community, as the collateral fund for the new loan borrowed by the Ministry is solid, the banking community then transferred this Italian Boxer Indemnity collateral as collateral to issue new treasury bonds, and it was not a motion from the Ministry. Currently, all methods are still under discussion and there is no concrete decision yet. (Special Dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Will Be Implemented in the Next Fiscal Year</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An official from the Ministry of Justice said that the Ministry plans to implement the new Court Organization Law in the second half of the 23rd fiscal year. However, there are quite a few county courts in the current three-level four-instance system for the first instance. In the future, after implementation, if these county courts are changed to branch courts of the district courts, they will handle first-instance cases at the same time as the district courts. Also, after the implementation of the three-level three-instance system, the number of cases in the high courts and the Supreme Court will increase sharply. In the future, in order to meet the needs of reality, the high courts in various provinces will inevitably add some branch courts, and the Supreme Court will also increase the number of divisions to handle the cases.

<p>Germany Declares a Ten-Day Truce with Austria</p>
<p>Austria Expresses Distrust Towards Germany</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia," the official newspaper of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, published an article today warning Germany not to interfere in Austrian affairs. The wording was unusually stern, stating that the joint declaration of Britain, France, and Italy affirmed the necessity of maintaining Austria's integrity and independence and had laid out a path for a united attitude and, when necessary, united action. There is now no doubt that the recent violent actions of the National Socialist Party in Austria were instigated by the Germans. Most of the murder weapons in Austria came from Germany. Italy wants a fair revision of the treaties, but this cannot be interpreted as allowing people to do whatever they want. It only wants to seek a collective and regulated restoration of countries and territories based on recognized justice. Italy will never give up its responsibilities and obligations as a major power. The views expressed in Italian newspapers must be strictly checked, so the above remarks are noteworthy. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

The truce period expires on the 28th. During this truce period, all National Socialist Party members are prohibited from attacking the government with force or propaganda. If the Austrian government does not accept this demand or its response is not satisfactory, "then war will begin again after the truce period expires." Habicht has repeatedly advised the military and civilians to join the organization he leads to drive out Prime Minister Dollfuss and form a new government with the National Socialist Party. According to observers, Austria's "Little Napoleon" has three paths to take: (1) Use force to curb the attacks of the National Socialist Party; (2) Accept the demands of the National Socialist Party and retire; (3) Appeal to the League of Nations. Observers continued that the German Social Party could obliterate the recent tripartite declaration signed by Britain, France, and Italy with cunning words. The National Socialist Party claimed that the German government did not want to force out Prime Minister Dollfuss. It was the National Socialist Party that wanted to drive Prime Minister Dollfuss out of Vienna and seize power. Prime Minister Dollfuss was extremely opposed to submitting this dispute to the League of Nations. Now Dollfuss may not be able to avoid taking this approach. Most of Austria has held demonstrations, and there have been clashes between the National Socialist Party and the police. (Guomin News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Vienna: German National Socialist Party propagandist Habicht gave a speech in Munich yesterday, saying that the truce between Germany and Austria would last until February 26. The Vienna newspapers did not know about this news at all. Reporters and officials generally believe that Habicht's attitude is a common tactic and is actually unfounded. The Austrian government stated that Vienna has not received any proposals from the German government, and that while Germany is proposing peace, it is also asking Austrian Social Party members to join the National Socialist Party, which shows no sincerity. Therefore, all parties do not pay attention to Habicht's speech. (Havas News Agency, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e48">Joint Declaration of England, France, and Italy <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Austria Welcomes It But Remains Pessimistic</p>
<p>German Newspaper Makes a Jesting Comment</p>
<p>(Vienna) The governments of England, France, and Italy have issued a joint declaration asserting the maintenance of Austrian independence. Austrian government officials consider this proof of aid to Austria and express their great welcome. However, they are quite pessimistic about whether this declaration will have any real effect. They believe that the issue of German-Austrian relations should still be submitted to the League of Nations for handling, and that this should be done very soon. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, a semi-official diplomatic and political commentary newspaper in Berlin published an article stating that the reason France initiated the joint declaration by England, France, and Italy to maintain Austrian independence was that the French government was deeply weary of the issue of military disarmament. Therefore, it fabricated this matter in order to slightly divert the attention of world opinion. There is a kind of agreement being formed between England, Italy, and Germany. The declaration by England, Germany, and Italy on the Austrian matter is no less than a countermeasure to this agreement. The newspaper further stated that although the French government has repeatedly stated that the three-nation declaration was initiated by Paris, Italy had actually had this intention for some time. The reason England and Italy jointly issued the declaration with France was simply that they did not want to trouble the League of Nations with this matter, or take other more inappropriate international steps, so they merely played along with France. Therefore, judging from the established facts, this three-nation declaration cannot be regarded as a victory for French policy, but rather as a failure of Austrian actions. Austria wanted to have this matter handled by the League of Nations, or thereby internationalize the internal turmoil. All such attempts have utterly failed. The Dolfuss government of Austria harbors prejudice and willingly allows the situation to worsen. Fortunately, its request has been rejected, giving Germany a complete victory. As for the maintenance of Austrian independence and territorial integrity mentioned in the three-nation declaration, and that existing treaties should not be violated, these are perfectly in line with German Chancellor Hitler's declaration not to interfere in Austria's internal affairs by force and not to violate any treaties related to Austria. (19th National dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Newspapers here comment on the joint declaration issued by England, France, and Italy, advocating the maintenance of Austrian independence, expressing extreme dissatisfaction with Italy. The semi-official diplomatic correspondence newspaper advocates that Germany adopt a new strategy to deal with the situation, namely, if the Austrian issue is to be discussed by the League of Nations or internationally as advocated by various countries, then Germany should demand that the issue of German-Austrian unification be decided by a referendum of Austrian citizens.

<p>Munich Although Habicht does not hold any official position in Germany, the German National Socialist Party regards him as an overseer of Austria and repeatedly makes radio broadcasts that are detrimental to Austria. This has led the Austrian government to lodge a serious accusation of foreigners interfering in its internal affairs. Now Habicht has again made dangerous threats. It is likely that the Austrian government will appeal to the great powers about this. Mr. Habicht was originally a press attaché at the German Embassy in Austria. He was expelled by the Austrian government last July for subversive activities. (19th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungary Hungarian newspapers have little commentary on the joint declaration by the three major powers of England, France, and Italy advocating the maintenance of Austrian independence. However, the non-partisan Az Est newspaper expressed its joy at this move, saying that Austrian independence is Hungary's barrier. The Nepszava newspaper of Budapest said that if the economic relations between Austria and Hungary could be expanded, both countries would benefit. However, Austro-Hungarian cooperation and the German-Austrian unification movement are diametrically opposed. It must be either Austro-Hungarian cooperation or German-Austrian unification, one of the two. If Austria can maintain its independence, then Austria and Hungary will inevitably grow closer.

<p>Austrian Prime Minister Explains Difficult Situation</p>
<p>(Vienna) The British Ambassador to Austria, on behalf of his government, today paid a visit to Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss and stated that British public opinion does not approve of the Austrian authorities' recent means of dealing with the recent turmoil, and asked why the Austrian authorities did not take preventative measures to prevent the bloodshed, knowing that the Socialist Party was prepared to resist by force. This is something the British cannot understand. Upon hearing this, Dollfuss immediately explained to the ambassador the truth about the turmoil and the difficult position of the Austrian government. (20th National Society dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Labour Party members in the House of Commons are fiercely opposed to the Austrian government's punishment of the Socialist Party. Mr. Wedgwood, a member of the party, asked Foreign Secretary Simon today whether the agreement between England, France, and Italy on the Austrian independence issue has the meaning of condoning the massacre. Upon hearing this, the members expressed their opposition to the Austrian government. A Conservative Party member then asked whether the views of various countries on Austrian independence would change due to the Austrian government's treatment of the working class. At that time, the noise was very loud. Foreign Secretary Simon then replied that the peace of Europe depends on whether Austria collapses. It would be inconvenient to change this view because of the recent events in Austria. (19th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Rome) Official circles say that the meeting of the prime ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary in Rome has not yet been confirmed. However, this meeting is still possible, and will probably be decided after the results of Italian Undersecretary Suvich's talks in Budapest are known. However, Suvich passed through Vienna on this trip without stopping. He will return to Rome from Budapest on Thursday morning. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Suvich set off for the capital of Hungary at 7:00 this morning.

<p>(Vienna) Foreign newspapers have recently been spreading rumors that after the political leaders of Italy, Hungary, and Austria hold a meeting in Rome soon, a customs union will be established between the three countries. There is still much doubt about this rumor here. When Prime Minister Dollfuss visited Budapest last time, he expressed his difficulty in implementing this proposal, because Italy has no interests to compensate Austria with. Back in 1922, Italy had a proposal to build an Italian-Austrian tax union, but it was soon automatically withdrawn, because it felt that it could not bear the heavy responsibility it deserved. Today, Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss again met with a reporter from a Hungarian newspaper and stated that he could neither confirm nor deny the rumors from the outside world. However, in the current situation, a customs union is really out of the question. However, if Austria and Hungary want to establish a close cooperation method, it is naturally not excluded.

<p>(Vienna) The commander of the Socialist Party defense team in the Giedehoff workers' district, Kloeberger, was recently sentenced to death by a special court.

<p>Hope for Resolution Within the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Warsaw) According to sources with inside information, Poland does not want to express any other attitude towards the Austrian issue other than hoping that it will be resolved within the scope of the League of Nations. However, it sympathizes with the fact that three of the signatory countries of the Four-Power Pact (England, France, and Italy) have already taken action. It is heard that Foreign Minister Colonel Beck recently went to Moscow and agreed with the Soviet authorities to maintain the status quo in Eastern Europe as the best way to maintain European peace. Poland and the Soviet Union have always believed that it is appropriate to establish an agreement to guarantee the neutrality of the Baltic countries and Finland, but it is not appropriate to announce this agreement at present. In addition, Poland has been acting as an intermediary between Romania and the Soviet Union. After Colonel Beck returns from Russia this time, he may go to Bucharest to report the specific views of Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov to Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu. (According to Romania and the Soviet Union, Poland is acting as an intermediary to enable them to directly negotiate a non-aggression treaty.) (19th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Escaped into the Mountains After the Defeat, Arrested by the Police</p>
<p>(Vienna) Prominent left-wing leader Wallisch has been sentenced to death for participating in the recent turmoil. Wallisch and 400 of his followers were recently defeated by the National Army in the area of ​​Weissenbach. Today, Wallisch was arrested by the police near Lunz and taken to Liezen, where he was sentenced to death by the court. Wallisch once served as the mayor of Weissenbach and presided over the rebellion. Later, due to the unfavorable situation, he led his followers to escape into the nearby mountains. However, most of his followers went elsewhere. It was once rumored that Wallisch had been assassinated by his followers in order to murder him for the government's reward of 30 pounds, but this was later proven to be untrue. Wallisch was a follower of Bela Kun, the revolutionary leader when the Hungarian Communists came to power after the European War. Later, he served in the Styrian provincial government as a member of the Socialist Party. (19th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Smooth Turn in Relations Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>British Goods Exports to Russia Expected to Increase Greatly</p>
<p>(London) The newly established Anglo-Russian trade agreement was announced today. Its content is indeed as expected, with the main purpose of balancing the amount of trade between the two countries. It stipulates that the ratio of goods exported from Russia to goods exported from Britain to Russia will be 1.7 to 1.0 in 1934, and will be reduced to 1.1 to 1.0 by 1938. British exports to Russia are expected to increase greatly in the future, because the ratio last year was one to four. In the agreement, the Soviet Union agrees to have commercial disputes handled by English courts. Both parties may terminate this agreement by giving six months' notice, and it is stipulated that Soviet goods will receive most-favored-nation treatment in all parts of the British Empire, with the exception of the Dominions. (19th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The trade agreement signed between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union is a temporary agreement, and its terms have just been announced. There are two very novel points. The first point comes from the Ottawa Agreement, which guarantees the preferential tariff treatment obtained by the British Dominions so as not to be affected by the excessively low prices of Soviet goods. Those whose economies are controlled by the state can cause prices to plummet or maintain goods that were originally low in price without rising. The second point is that the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union should restore the balance of trade with each other. The agreement stipulates on the first point, "If the value of goods exported by one contracting country affects the preferential treatment and causes inconvenience to the local products of the other contracting country, then the other country may notify the first country of this matter." It is also stipulated that in such cases, both parties will negotiate. If the negotiations fail, the affected country may declare that it will suspend the application of most-favored-nation treatment to the relevant goods three months after the date of the first notification. In addition to stipulating the minimum price of goods exported by both parties, the agreement limits the ratio of the amount of trade between the two countries in order to seek a balance in business between them. According to this ratio, the first year's Soviet exports are compared to British exports, with a ratio of one to seven, which will gradually decrease to one to one. In addition, the United Kingdom continues to grant diplomatic personnel privileges to the Soviet trade delegation. The agreement has no fixed term of validity, but either party may declare it abolished by giving three months' prior notice. (19th Havas)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Pravda newspaper commented on the signing of the trade agreement with the Soviet Union, saying, "This agreement will lay the foundation for an important development in normal economic relations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, and at the same time, it will be a turning point, so that relations between the proletarian country and one of the world's largest capitalist countries will gradually improve, and a new factor will be added to the promotion of peace. The signing of this agreement was the result of long and protracted negotiations (for which the Soviet Union bears no responsibility). At the same time, the agreement will undoubtedly be a head-on blow to the plans of those who are obsessed with the anti-Soviet economic war, such as Conservative Party adventurers and a large number of politicians suffering from hysteria. As for those who intend to use provocative and military adventurous policies to destroy commercial relations with the Soviet Union, they should also receive a warning. The Soviet Union's public opinion naturally welcomes the fact that the more far-sighted and sound views of a part of the British bourgeoisie have been able to overcome their views with a tendency towards adventure.

<p>Lancashire Pays Attention to Today's Meeting</p>
<p>(London) Talks between the British and Japanese cotton industries will resume tomorrow. The attention of people in Lancashire is focused on this. After the talks last week, the British representatives sent a document to the Japanese representatives, clearly stating that Lancashire's position is that any agreement must cover the world market. This position directly contradicts the Japanese side's first step, which is to require that the scope of application of the agreement be limited to British colonies. This restriction is not acceptable to Lancashire, as the discussion only covers one-tenth of Lancashire's export market. It will be known tomorrow what concessions the Japanese side is prepared to make. However, judging from recent phenomena, the Japanese representatives do not seem prepared to make much concessions. A detailed examination of the cotton import figures for British colonies reveals the extent of the Japanese cotton goods' intrusion. Western Africa is Lancashire's most important export market. Last year, Lancashire's exports decreased from 159 million yards to 102 million yards. The most-favored-nation treatment clause was revoked a few months ago as a method to prevent the intrusion of Japanese goods. British cloth imports in Ceylon were 32.1 million yards in 1927, but had decreased to 15.8 million yards by 1932, while Japanese cotton cloth increased from 6.1 million yards to 40.4 million yards. Japan's exports to Sudan increased from 35 million yards in 1929 to 42 million yards in 1932, while Lancashire's exports fell from 11.1 million yards to 6.6 million yards. Japan's cotton trade in Kenya and Uganda in Africa increased from 14.6 million yards to 30 million yards between 1928 and 1932, while Lancashire's decreased from 9.5 million yards to 5.7 million yards. At the same time, the quantity of Japanese cotton cloth imported into Tanganyika in Africa increased from 9.2 million yards to 21.9 million yards, while the quantity of goods imported by Lancashire decreased by half, to 4.6 million yards. Last year, Lancashire's exports to Hong Kong also decreased greatly, from 52,866,800 yards to 18,618,300 yards. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Chief Secretary Horikiri, worried about the interruption of the Hatoyama Minister of Education's bribery problem, visited Prime Minister Saito's private residence in the Yotsuya district on the afternoon of the 19th. Although the Prime Minister's condition was not good, he met with Horikiri because the matter was of great importance. As a result of the exchange of opinions, the opinions of the two people were the same as follows:</p>
<p>(1) As the Ministry of Justice has made clear, the issue of Minister of Education Hatoyama receiving money is completely non-criminal. However, since public doubts have arisen, the clouds of doubt must be cleared. It seems that Minister of Education Hatoyama has realized that he will resign. If the investigation committee submits a report of resignation after investigating the truth, the Minister of Education will be changed decisively.</p>

Ministers Takahashi and Yamamoto also agreed to proceed according to this policy.

The seats of the members belonging to the Seiyukai were mostly empty, which was quite eye-catching. The following proposal was unanimously adopted by the full house, "The House of Representatives expresses condolences for the death of His Majesty King Albert I of Belgium." Then, the proceedings moved on to the bills, and Ichiro Kiyose of the Kokumin Domei requested to speak,</p>

<p>Naval Vessel Tonnage to Be Significantly Modified</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to naval experts here, the 1935 Naval Conference will significantly modify naval vessel tonnage limits, intending to reduce the maximum tonnage from 35,000 tons to 30,000 or 25,000 tons. Although the United States is making every effort to oppose the reduction of naval vessel tonnage, there are currently no plans to build large warships, and the government's attitude has recently changed. Previously, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, and Italy all discussed reducing naval vessel tonnage in Geneva, with only the United States strongly opposing it. The United Kingdom intends to change the maximum tonnage to 22,000 tons, while Japan intends to change it to 25,000 tons. Smaller naval powers all intend to change the maximum limit to 10,000 tons. However, detailed investigations reveal that no country has built extremely large tonnage vessels after the war. The United Kingdom has fifteen large warships, with the Hood being the largest, at 42,100 tons, launched in 1920. The remaining ships are around 29,150 tons. The total tonnage of British warships is 474,750 tons. The United States also has fifteen large warships, with the Pennsylvania being the largest, at 33,100 tons. The smallest, the Arkansas, is 26,100 tons. The total tonnage of the U.S. Navy's warships is 455,450 tons. In the past, the United States strongly advocated building large tonnage warships for the sake of fully protecting its territories, but according to experts' research, 25,000-ton vessels are also quite applicable. Japan has ten large warships, with a total tonnage of 298,400 tons. Japan is concerned about the powerful U.S. Navy, so it strongly advocates reducing naval vessel tonnage.

<p>(Washington) The Vinson Naval Bill, previously passed in the House of Representatives, is being formally discussed in the Senate today. According to the proposal, it aims to build 120 warships and 1,184 naval aircraft to the maximum extent possible under the Naval Conference Treaty.

<p>Borrowing $2.5 Million from the U.S.</p>
<p>Ordering Aircraft and Opening Factories in Russia</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, Eugene Chen, General Manager of the Curtiss-Wright Airplane Company, stated that the Soviet Russian government is currently in negotiations with the U.S. government to order aircraft engine contracts, requiring a loan of approximately $2.5 million. He also said that the company had manufactured aircraft engines for Soviet Russia and will now fully deliver them. The current plan is to establish a factory in Russia and send American technicians to provide guidance. It is said that the Soviet Russian authorities intend to build the Soviet Russian army into the world's number one, as countries are currently competing on naval issues. According to military experts' observations, the Russian air force already ranks second in the world, superior to the British and American, only slightly inferior to the French. It is said that Russia can produce 35 aircraft per day. Once problems arise in the Far East, or in a war with Japan, it will be well-equipped to cope. As for the Soviet Russian government's negotiations with the U.S. government to borrow money, with the recent cooperation between the U.S. and Russia, this matter will likely succeed.

<p>The Blood and Tears of the Northeastern People</p>
<p>Japan's Controlled Economy</p>
<p>The Hardships and Destitution of the Peasants</p>
<p>The three northeastern provinces have been ravaged by the Japanese army for more than two years. Now, there is hardly any place without Japanese troops. The three northeastern provinces are almost entirely under Japanese rule, but there is one exception: the northeastern part of Jilin, the triangle along the Ussuri River to the intersection of the Heilongjiang River, namely the three counties of Fuyuan, Raohe, and Hulin, still proudly displaying the Blue Sky White Sun flag and continuing to maintain the Republic of China's era name. Someone came from Raohe the day before yesterday. According to what he said, the most difficult thing there is the sparse population, the difficulty of providing supplies, and the lack of bullets, which are relatively minor matters. Because the Righteous Army there was not formed by outlaws or regular troops at the beginning, but by local Red Spear Society and Big Sword Society members. A year and a half ago, they were only armed with nationalistic zeal, holding knives and guns and fighting desperately with the enemy. Moreover, due to the convenience of the geography, the undulations of the mountains, and the density of the forests, they managed to survive. Now they are surrounded and blockaded. Domestic assistance is naturally difficult to reach, and foreign transportation is extremely difficult. What they rely on to support themselves now is only their spirit of enduring hardship. The Righteous Army in those three counties only eats one kind of food: cornmeal. When winter comes, there are naturally no vegetables or salt. They lack all other necessities of life. The replenishment of clothing relies entirely on the raw hides of the few wild animals they hunt.</p>
<p>However, they have created several new things themselves. First, they have no paper, but they have pens that have survived and are not broken. When they want to write an order or pass a message, they use the inner husks of corn as paper and barely manage to write. They still want to smoke, but there is no possibility of getting cigarettes. Even ready-made dry tobacco is like a treasure. However, they use kitchen knives or bayonets to cut tobacco leaves into shreds, then wrap them in corn husks and smoke them. Such things can truly be said to be forced to reverse the course of history. However, those involved still believe that they must fight to the end and use their primitive methods to fight to the death with the newly emerging imperialists.</p>
<p>Speaking of how Japan treats the people of the three northeastern provinces, first we must think of the so-called "Manchukuo" taxes. At the beginning of the Japanese invasion of Northeast China, they repeatedly claimed that they were overthrowing warlord rule. Therefore, in the past, many people were anesthetized by them, and many people were willing to be their running dogs, seeking immediate benefits and foolishly hoping for future gains. However, as of now, the facts have gradually become clear. The increase in taxes is indeed progressing day by day. For example, the regular tax and surcharges levied per "tian" (a unit of land area in Northeast China, equivalent to ten mu in Liaoning, each mu being 720 square steps) used to be no more than 7.5 yuan, but now it has increased to 17 or 18 yuan, or even 20 yuan per "tian." Fortunately, the harvest has been very good in the past two years, and they can still barely manage to endure hardship and live their lives.</p>
<p>Secondly, grain prices are low, less than half of what they used to be. The villagers are all complaining bitterly. The grain they want to sell cannot be sold, and the necessities such as clothing that they want to buy cannot be bought. The most difficult thing is the man-made restrictions. Since Japan has brought all the railways under the management of the South Manchuria Railway Company, it has increased the freight rates very high. Red sorghum that sells for only three or four yuan per shi (a unit of dry measure) in the countryside must cost more than ten yuan to transport it to the interior. Such a vicious plan truly leaves the villagers with no way to go.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it is implementing its so-called general control economy. It is conducting a general survey of the lives of the people in all parts of the three northeastern provinces, except for the above-mentioned counties where the power of the Japanese army cannot reach. It is having the county governments notify each district and township to register the population, land, livestock, vehicles, sleds, chickens, dogs, etc., and have each township and district be responsible for the registration. The forms are sent to the county, from the county to the province, and from the province to the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army. In the event of an emergency, it can follow the survey forms, distribute orders to each county, and assign them without any omissions. Truly, no one can escape. Not long ago, horses and vehicles were requisitioned near Changchun and Jilin for the Asahikawa Division's trip to the Greater Khingan Mountains. After being requisitioned, they were never returned. Although it is only considered a preparatory period now, the economic lives of the people in Northeast China are truly completely in the hands of the Japanese. To try to revolt will also require a great deal of effort. (February 9th)</p>

<p>Situation Reported by Li Yuegai and Yang Yiqian</p>
<p>British Soldiers Building Roads and Establishing Wireless Telegraphs</p>
<p>Christian Converts Are All Willing Accomplices</p>
<p>Kunming Correspondence: In December of last year, the border of Yunnan, close to Burma, was suddenly invaded by more than 2,000 British soldiers from Burma, showing a great intention to encroach upon our western frontier. The situation suddenly became tense. The following is an urgent record of the report telegraphed by the two supervisors Li Yuegai and Yang Yiqian last month, to show its general situation.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Report by Li Yuegai <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>(1) To the Yunnan Provincial Government: Top Secret. According to reports, a British mining company is currently raising 7.5 million rupees to operate a mine in the undetermined section of the southern border. The road has been opened to Shanglongdu, and the purpose is probably in the Banglong area. It is said that the excavation of the old silver mine is coming to an end, and the other party has long had the intention of moving the site, which was previously handled by the Yibei Dao. This time it is likely to be realized. Although it is not known who is in charge and where, it seems that there is no doubt that the first step is to start from the Banglong area. It has been found that Banglong and Bangkuang are currently under the influence of the Hui Muslim Ma Meiting. Ma's heart is quite outward-looking, and even County Magistrate Ru Zhen of Na County is difficult to influence due to his Hui Muslim background. In the future, the Banglong area may become another lost cause. (Omission) Supervisor Li Yuegai's seal. (2) To the Yunnan Provincial Government: Top Secret. As per the telegraphic dispatch, the letter from the Zhenkang Na County Magistrate reports that merchants returning to Zhenkang from Lashio reported that the British are actively repairing the Guogan to Pinlong River road this year and transporting large quantities of luggage to Kawa Mountain. In addition, the Mengding Tusi reported that merchants from Banglong to Meng were suddenly summoned back by Banglong official Xin Dong (presumably Ma Meiting), and none were allowed to stay outside. The actions of the British are somewhat different from previous years. It is not known what their intentions are. We will report again after confirmation. It has been found that no abnormalities have been reported elsewhere along the border. It is undoubtedly the matter presented in the telegraphic dispatch. In addition to ordering an investigation into the destination of the British, whether it is also in Inner and Outer Kawa, and whether there are any military actions, please consider and instruct accordingly. Supervisor Li Yuegai's seal. (3) To the Yunnan Provincial Government: Top Secret. According to the Geng Dai telegram from the Diankang Na County Magistrate, British-Burmese personnel were sent to Banghong Silver Mine in five waves for investigation. After returning to Yangon, the Burmese government immediately dispatched more than 500 British soldiers to station on the Gunlong River bank in Guogan, and supervised the construction of bridges and roads to Banghong, and set up a wireless telegraph station. They also recruited a large number of horse caravans to carry mining equipment, and are currently actively proceeding. The heads of the various Hululu Wang areas are extremely alarmed by this move. It is now heard that they have summoned more than 1,000 Kawa soldiers to prepare for resistance, and the situation is tense. (Omission) Supervisor Li Yuegai's seal.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Report by Yang Yiqian <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Most Urgent. To the Commander-in-Chief and Chairman of the Provincial Capital: As per the urgent report from the Lancang County Magistrate Zhan De, using the code name "Most Urgent": At 4 PM on January 4th, according to the special urgent report from the district chief Peng Hesheng of the district under his jurisdiction, the headman of Mengjiao Dong, Han Hua, reported that a local merchant Zhang Wanmei, who went to the Banglong border area for business in early December, suddenly discovered seven or eight British people gathering the people for secret meetings in the Banglong area on the 14th of the month. On the 19th, more than 2,000 British soldiers were discovered, all carrying work equipment. Wherever they went, they repaired the roads so that motorcycles could pass. They are currently building a steel bridge on the Banglong River. The general talk is that they intend to urgently occupy our Banhong gold mine. However, in addition to occupying the gold mine, it is not known whether there are other intentions. The officer found this to be true and immediately sent people to Banhong to notify the local heads to try to stop it. This matter concerns national defense and should be reported for inspection and instructions. The Banhong gold mine has long been coveted by the British. The pastor Yong Weixing and his son have spared no effort to entice and deliberately incite the believers, with the intention of using softening tactics to plunder the mining area in that area invisibly. (Omission) In addition to telegraphing the county magistrate to instruct the local district chiefs and headmen under his jurisdiction to quickly comfort the gentry and not blindly believe in the instigation of foreigners, (Omission) it is appropriate to telegraph this report for inspection and instructions.

<p>The Yunnan Provincial Party Department yesterday reported that the Lancang County People's National Salvation Branch telegraphed that near Banhong, there were more than 3,000 British soldiers, each carrying equipment and tools, building roads for automobiles, and building steel bridges, intending to forcibly seize our gold and silver mineral resources. Therefore, at 1 PM on February 1st, it convened a meeting of provincial and municipal mass organizations to discuss how to respond. It was then decided to first establish a Yunnan People's Foreign Affairs Support Association to handle this matter. (February 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e91">The West Route Army Captures Yongxin <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Bandit Xiao Flees to Fenyi and Suichuan</p>
<p>Provincial Government Appoints Zhou Guixun as County Magistrate</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, is located at the foot of the famous bandit lair Jinggang Mountain, bordering the counties of Chaling and Youxian in Hunan, and Ninggang, Suichuan, and Lianhua in the bandit-affected area of Jiangxi Province. Due to the overlapping mountains, wilderness, and remoteness, it was occupied by local bandits Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai in 1927. Later, the Communist bandits Zhu De and Mao Zedong entered Jiangxi from Hunan and Guangdong, and used this as their base. In 1929, the National Army repeatedly launched suppression campaigns, gaining and losing territory in turn. Since then, it has never seen the light of day, and is like a region outside of civilization. Last year, He Jian led the Western Route Army to capture Yongxin and Ninggang. However, Yongxin was too deeply banditized, and transportation was blocked, making it impossible to manage effectively, resulting in the loss of territory. The headquarters of the bandit leader Xiao Ke's pseudo-Eighth Army, the headquarters of the pseudo-Hunan-Jiangxi Military Region, the pseudo-Hunan-Jiangxi Provincial Government, and the pseudo-Red Army School were all located there, no less than a small Moscow in western Jiangxi. In order to eliminate the Red bandit base, He Jian ordered Liu Jianxu to lead the divisions of Chen Guangzhong and Wang Dongyuan to attack Yongxin from Ninggang and Lianhua in November last year, taking a step-by-step approach, building a site and constructing fortifications, gradually advancing. By this year, the strategic locations near Yongxin and the Red bandit fortifications have all been occupied by Liu's troops, pressing towards Yongxin County. The pseudo-Seventeenth and Eighteenth Divisions of the bandit Xiao fled in two routes to Fenyi and Suichuan in the north and south. Only the pseudo-local bandit army held on to their old nest. Military news was recently received that the Chen and Wang divisions of Liu's troops have recovered Yongxin County. The provincial government has appointed Zhou Guixun as the county magistrate to carry out the aftermath.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Xu, He, Kong, and Wu Bandits Daily Approaching Demise <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Xu Bandit Trapped in Tongba, He Bandit Fled Back to Sangzhi</p>
<p>Henan Bandits Hide in Yangtong, Wu Bandit Retreats to Anhui Territory</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Xu, He, Kong, and Wu bandits, scattered in the border regions of Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, have apparently formed four major strongholds. After long-term and relentless suppression by the National Army, they all show signs of gradually declining. Among them, the Xu bandit faction developed the fastest in the past year, occupying more than ten counties in Shaanxi and Sichuan, and establishing the "Sichuan-Shaanxi Soviet Government" in Changchi, Nanjiang, presided over by the bogus chairman Zhang Guotao and bogus director of the General Political Department Fu Zhong. The strength of the bandit army also expanded from more than 10,000 to 50,000 or 60,000, including the Fourth, Ninth, Twenty-fifth, Thirtieth, and Thirty-first Armies, as well as independent divisions and the North Sichuan Guerrilla Force. He Wei, Yu Haizhou, Wang Shusheng, and Li Tai served as army commanders, while Wang Hongkun, Ni Zhiliang, Ren Huizhang, and others served as division commanders, all under the banner of the so-called "Fourth Front Army of the Workers and Peasants' Red Army," led by the bogus commander-in-chief Xu Xiangqian, bogus deputy commander-in-chief Wang Shusheng, and bogus director of the Political Department Chen Changhao. There was a growing trend of sweeping across Sichuan. However, after the general offensive by the Sichuan Army, Yingshan, Yilong, Suiding, and Xuanhan were successively recovered by the National Army. The area occupied by the bandits gradually decreased, and their strength also gradually declined. They then attempted to hold the Tongnan-Ba line. Xu Xiangqian personally led the bogus Ninth Army to garrison Tongjiang, Chen Changhao led the bogus Fourth Army to garrison Bazhong, while the Twenty-fifth and Thirty-first Armies garrisoned Nanjiang, and the Thirtieth Army garrisoned Chengkou, thus forming the current situation of encirclement and suppression by various armies. Currently, the First and Second Routes of Liu Xiang's troops are attacking Nanjiang from Zhaoguang, the Third and Fourth Routes are attacking Bazhong from Yilong, and the Fifth and Sixth Routes are attacking Tongjiang from Xuanwan, cutting off the bandit's connection between Sichuan and Shaanxi in the north. Although the Shaanxi Army has not yet moved out, it has all been concentrated and prepared. In the future, descending south along the Han River, they can directly strike the bandit's rear. According to reports from Sichuan, Nanjiang has already been recovered by the National Army. If this information is confirmed, the bandit's situation will become even more precarious, and their attempt to flee to Shaanxi will also be impossible. The He bandit faction, known as the bogus Second Front Army, is operating in the so-called West Hubei Military Region, with He as the commander-in-chief, commanding the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Third Divisions, with Xia Xi and others serving as division commanders. Initially, they invaded Qianjiang County in eastern Sichuan. After their failure, they fled back to Lichuan, Enshi, Yien, Xianfeng, Laifeng, and Hefeng Counties in Hubei Province. Due to the blocking by Xu Yuanquan's army, they fled further towards Sangzhi, Longshan, and Yongshun in western Hunan. It is now reported that they have reached Sangzhi. This place is the hometown of the He bandit and has long been their old base. He Jian is currently dispatching troops to attack them fiercely. The so-called leaders of the Hunan-Hubei bogus government, besides Xia Xi and He Long, include Guan Xiangying, Song Panming, Lu Dongsheng, and Chen Peiyin, who have either been massacred or dispersed. The bandits in southern Hubei are under the command of Kong Hechong, with a so-called Southeast Government. The bandit leader Zhang Tao serves as the bogus chairman and commander-in-chief, and Ye Jinbo serves as the deputy commander. They have the bogus Third Division, the North Jiangxi Division, and the Independent Division, totaling more than 5,000 people. They have repeatedly attacked the Hunan-Hubei Railway and twice invaded Chongyang and Tongshan, but both attempts failed, resulting in significant losses in strength. Three division commanders have already been eliminated. Currently, there are still scattered bandits in Yangxin and Tongshan, and Chen Jicheng is directing the stationed troops to search and suppress them. As for the Wu Huanxian bandit faction, they roam the borders of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, in the so-called Eastern Hubei Military Region. The original Twenty-fifth and Twenty-eighth Armies, after suffering losses, have been merged into one army, with Wu serving as the army commander and Xu Haidong and Zhou Xiyuan serving as division commanders. It has become difficult for them to gain a foothold in Huang'an and Macheng in eastern Hubei, as well as Guangshan, Luoshan, Shangcheng, and Gushi in southern Henan. It is reported that the remnants of the bandits have now fled into Lihuang County in Anhui Province, where they are exhausted and running out of resources, and are no longer a threat to the three provinces. In summary, these four factions, at their peak, had a total of more than 85,000 people and 50,000 to 60,000 guns. Now, they have lost more than half of their strength. If a large army continues to be deployed against them, regardless of territorial boundaries, the day of complete eradication will not be far off. It is also reported that the Communist bandits held a meeting in Jiangxi, and Article 3 of Item C stated: "The overall situation in the southeast is primarily focused on Hubei Province. Capturing Hubei Province can control Jiangsu and Anhui. Jiangxi Province can serve as a shield. The Red Armies of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi Provinces should select elite troops and develop towards the Hubei area in multiple routes, coordinating with each other and using guerrilla warfare to expand the Soviet areas. The resolution is to unite the provinces and act simultaneously, so that the National Army cannot deploy troops everywhere, in order to achieve the effect of encirclement." However, the Second National Soviet Congress convened by the bandits in Jiangxi was held on December 11th of last year. At that time, the Fujian rebellion was breaking out, and the overall situation was serious. The military plan of the bandit party was determined in response to the situation at the time. Now, the Fujian rebellion has been quelled, the exit route for the Jiangxi bandits has been cut off, and the Xu, He, Kong, and Wu factions are declining daily. The original plan to "capture Hubei Province" and "develop towards the Hubei area" is absolutely impossible and nothing but a futile dream. (February 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Fuzhou Celebrates Central Army Victory <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>A Touch of the Lunar New Year</p>
<p>A General Overview of Finance, Military Affairs, and Civil Administration</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: During the Gregorian New Year, Fujian was still under the rule of the bogus People's Government. The bogus Cultural Committee held a so-called "Production and People's Entertainment Conference" at the Chengtian Theater. Fearing bombing by Central aircraft, the opening was held at night. Unexpectedly, only a little more than a month later, during the Lunar New Year, the bogus People's Government completely collapsed. Fujian was restored to the Central Government. All sectors in the provincial capital held a recreational gathering in West Lake Park on February 15th and 16th to celebrate the victory of the Central Army. There were new dramas, old dramas, movies, songs and dances, storytelling, magic, martial arts, dragon lanterns, fireworks, and other activities. Aircraft distributed leaflets, and personnel from the party, government, and military sectors gave speeches. The audience was quite lively. This was indeed a touch of the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>In terms of finance, the new salaries of various agencies and organizations were paid at one-third of the February and March salaries during the Lunar New Year. However, education expenses were paid at 50%, and teachers and staff were still dissatisfied. They plan to hold another meeting in the coming days to discuss methods of demanding payment. The business and financial situation is also very difficult. Only less than half of the accounts are being paid on the market. Loans from money houses have been extended to the second day of the Lunar New Year. Therefore, no bankruptcies have occurred yet.</p>
<p>In terms of military affairs, news of bandit suppression in northern Fujian is quite quiet. However, according to refugees who escaped from the bandit-occupied counties, the Red bandits are now confiscating military equipment and food obtained from Shunchang, Jiangle, Shaxian, and Yong'an Counties and forcing thousands of laborers to transport them to the bogus army headquarters in Mingxi County for storage. On the other hand, they are promoting heresies, oppressing good people to become Red Guards, and women to become comfort corps. City walls have been demolished, and many people who have been killed are abandoned in the wilderness and mountain pits, which is a very tragic situation. It is reported that after Chiang Ting-wen goes to Quanzhou to assume the post of commander-in-chief of the East Route Army, Wei Lihuang will go to Yanping to assume the post of forward commander of the East Route Army to oversee the bandit suppression efforts.</p>
<p>In terms of civil administration, there has been no significant news in the past week. However, the director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau was replaced by Li Zhengde (from Zhejiang) on the 15th. Sun Jiazhe, the director of the Finance Department, is expected to arrive in Fujian from Shanghai on the 17th. After Sun takes office, Xu Fu will abolish the Finance Special Commissioner's Office, and he plans to go to Nanjing. (Although Xu was recommended by the Provincial Committee as acting director of finance, he still acts in the name of the Finance Special Commissioner to the outside world.) In addition, Li Zuyu, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, is expected to come to Fujian to take office during the Lantern Festival in the Lunar New Year. The Security Office began operations on the 16th and is attached to the Provincial Government, with Chen Yi concurrently serving as the director, Xiao Qian serving as the deputy director, and Chen Jingcun serving as the chief of staff. The future powers of this office will be quite significant. All troops not belonging to the East Route Bandit Suppression Army will be under the jurisdiction of this office, in order to increase the power of the Provincial Chairman in politics.</p>
<p>In terms of party affairs, the current situation is being temporarily maintained by Party Affairs Special Commissioner Dai Kuisheng, and no progress is being made, pending the arrival of the newly appointed Special Commissioner Chen Zhaoying to take over. (February 17th)</p>

<p>And Stopping Military and Government Agencies from Harassing and Extorting</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chairman Chiang, considering that western and northern Hubei often violate the ban on opium planting, which urgently needs to be thoroughly eradicated, cabled the Hubei Provincial Government again on the 17th, reaffirming the ban and ordering strict prohibition of planting. Violators will be severely punished in accordance with the repeated orders. Furthermore, considering that the stationed troops and local officials and gentry in western and northern Hubei are arbitrarily increasing special taxes and surcharges, or harassing and extorting, he also cabled Zhang Qun, Qian Dajun, and Xu Yuanquan to investigate and prohibit it. The cable reads: "Chairman Zhang of Wuchang, Chief of Staff Qian of the General Headquarters, and forwarding to Commander-in-Chief Xu, as well as all division commanders and Director Huang of the Special Tax Office: Recently, it has been reported that the stationed troops, and local officials and gentry in western and northern Hubei are still arbitrarily collecting special taxes and surcharges, or harassing and extorting under various pretexts, which is a clear violation of discipline and extremely hateful. It is hoped that you will separately and earnestly investigate and prohibit it, and instruct all military and government personnel and local leaders under your command to strictly comply. If it is found again that anyone arbitrarily extorts or harasses and extorts, they will be severely punished, and the responsible officials will not be able to evade their responsibilities. You must comply with this and report back for further action. Chiang Kai-shek's seal, Jiangxi," (February 19th)</p>

<p>The River Dredging Committee established its office in the Quan Jie Tang today (the 20th). All department staff members reported for duty and began work. The committee also held its second standing committee meeting. County Magistrate Jin Tigan, the chairman, performed the rituals and reported on the progress of preparations. Then, they discussed the proposals, the main points of which were: (1) Regarding the case of discussing and determining the location for dumping mud during the dredging of the city river, it was resolved that the directors of each section should investigate and determine the locations for dumping mud within their jurisdiction and report them to the standing committee members for verification. (2) The estimated cost of dredging the river in this session, including the tributaries, is 63,000 yuan. In addition to the 28,000 yuan allocated by the official authorities, there is still a shortage of 35,000 yuan. How should we raise the money locally? It was resolved that fundraising should be divided into two types: general and special. The general donation will be based on the example of the house rent donation collected last year. For houses that are residential or self-owned and do not have a rental price to base on, the value will be estimated and determined. Special donations will be levied on industries such as bamboo and wood, rice, knitting, and coarse paper making. Donation tickets will be divided into red and black to show the difference. (3) Regarding the case of adding Hutxi River to the list of tributaries to be dredged, it was resolved that it be passed.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the Chenjiaxing Winter Defense Security Corps was suddenly attacked by a number of bandits late on the 18th. They encountered the corps police and clashed. However, they were outnumbered and outgunned. As a result, the bandits robbed two rifles and left in a hurry. The director of the corps has reported the incident to the county police authorities, requesting them to pursue and arrest the thieves and recover the stolen goods in order to deter illegal activities.

<p>Among the three highways with Suzhou as the center, namely the Sujia, Sukun, and Suchang Roads, the Sujia Road has been fully opened to traffic, and the Sukun Road has also completed the roadbed. Only the Changshu section of the Suchang Road has completed the roadbed. Now, the Jiangsu Construction Department has determined that these three roads must be completed before the opening of the Southeast Transportation Exhibition to be held in June. It has specially dispatched engineer Wen Zhengwei, who came to Suzhou yesterday (the 20th) to work with technical director Zhou Jun and surveyor Hua Chi to inspect the construction methods of the Suchang Road. As a result, it was decided that the road would be connected to the Suzhou Ring Road outside the railway station at Yangqi to connect with the Sujia Road. It was also decided that all road work would be rushed to completion within two months. The entire road requires the construction of 24 bridges, which will be planned by the department and then constructed. In the future, the road can reach Suzhou from Changshu, and then to Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province, or directly to Shanghai via the Sukun Road.</p>

<p>The Taihu Lake Basin Water Conservancy Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and others petitioned the central government to allocate cotton and wheat loans to dredge the Wusong River. According to the latest news from the Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Committee, the case has been resolved by the Central Political Conference. All water conservancy matters will be handled by the National Economic Committee in a unified manner, and a portion of the cotton and wheat loans will be allocated for construction. The National Economic Committee is currently planning this, and the issue of dredging the Wusong River is likely to be realized.</p>

<p>After the second election of the County Chamber of Commerce on January 15th, a dispute arose because the incumbent supervisory committee member was elected as an executive committee member. An interpretation was requested from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The Ministry replied by telegram, stating that the incumbent supervisory committee member only needed to resign and be appointed as an executive committee member. Due to the end of the lunar year, reorganization could not be completed. Therefore, yesterday (the 20th) at noon, after holding a spring banquet at the chamber, a tea party was held. Chairman Yang Hanxi discussed the cases: (1) The second executive committee will hold a meeting within February 25th to reorganize and elect standing committee members. (2) Regarding the issue of brokerage licenses, a meeting of the relevant industries will be held on a scheduled basis to discuss a solution. (3) The construction of houses next to the chamber will be handled by the executive committee after the design is completed. After discussing academic matters, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Our county is known as a rice-gathering area. Rice merchants from various provinces come to Wuxi to buy and sell, mainly because Wuxi's land and water transportation are more convenient, and warehouses are lined up. In recent years, there have been bumper harvests, but sales have been sluggish, and all warehouses are overflowing. At the beginning of last winter, because there were many soybeans, the warehouse space was already tight when rice and paddy were on the market. By the end of the accounting period, all warehouses were full, which was more than the previous year. The inventory of each warehouse is as follows: 631,100 dan of japonica paddy, 139,800 dan of yuan paddy, 827,200 dan of indica paddy, 1,100 shi of unpolished yuan rice, 224,000 shi of unpolished japonica rice, 33,100 shi of unpolished indica rice, 27,700 shi of wheat, 398,800 shi of soybeans, 98,100 shi of mung beans, and 77,600 shi of miscellaneous grains. Rice merchants, rice mills, and rice shops opened yesterday, and the tea party for the rice industry set the market price for unpolished japonica rice, which was one jiao higher than last year, while japonica paddy was five fen higher, white rice was one or two jiao higher, and white indica rice was two jiao higher. The rest also increased slightly. The prices are: 6.1 jiao to 5.4 jiao for unpolished japonica rice, 6.5 jiao to 5.9 jiao for unpolished yuan rice, 5.4 jiao to 5.1 jiao for unpolished Dazi rice, 5.7 jiao to 5.3 jiao for unpolished Yangxian rice, 3.15 jiao to 3.0 jiao for japonica paddy, 2.95 jiao to 2.6 jiao for Dazi paddy, 3.1 jiao to 2.9 jiao for Yangxian paddy, 3.5 jiao to 3.3 jiao for yuan paddy, 6.9 jiao to 6.0 jiao for white rice, 6.5 jiao to 5.8 jiao for white Yangxian rice, 4.6 jiao for wheat, 2.5 jiao to 2.1 jiao for barley, and 5.0 jiao for soybeans.</p>

<p>The county government of our district recently received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Government to thoroughly investigate whether Yao Chunjie, the former chief of the special affairs team of the Wuxi Public Security Bureau, had colluded with Liu Yueqing, the chief of the Ninth Branch Bureau, to privately release Yu Zhu, an opium trafficker from Zhuxiang Lane, Kaiyuan Township (i.e., the wife of Yu Shengqing), in exchange for a bribe. Furthermore, the 63 taels of opium, 45 yuan in silver dollars, and 55 yuan in paper money seized at the scene were not handed over to the authorities. In addition, Cai Yulong handled 200 yuan in silver dollars as a condition for avoiding arrest. If this is true, they should be severely punished. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Yan ordered the Public Security Bureau yesterday to start the investigation in order to verify the facts.</p>

<p>The construction bureaus of the counties in Jiangsu Province were abolished last year due to financial difficulties. Shen Baixian, the current director of the Construction Department, believes that it is necessary to restore construction in the important counties north and south of the Yangtze River. Therefore, the departments in Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wuxian, Baoshan, Nantong, and Rugao are being converted into bureaus. The bureau chiefs have been appointed separately. Liu Yongnian, the bureau chief of Zhenjiang Construction Bureau, came to the province yesterday to visit Director Shen and ask for instructions on everything. It is reported that the Zhenjiang bureau will be restored on March 1st. The internal organization is simple. Under the bureau chief, there will only be two sections: administrative affairs and technology. Each section will have one director, and below them will only be one administrative and one technical staff member.</p>

<h3 id="e103">A General Overview of Various Industries After the Year-End Accounting <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>In Yangzhou, less than 50% of the stores, following the usual practice, reopened on the 18th (i.e., the day of the God of Wealth in the lunar calendar) after the year-end accounting for the 22nd year. Very few made a profit, mainly due to the impact of rural bankruptcy. A survey of the conditions of various industries is as follows: The money industry has declined since the abolition of taels and the change to yuan. Among the accounting statements of various banks, Yisheng Bank showed a slightly larger profit, but it was still less than 10,000 yuan, which was far from previous years. Yesterday, the colleagues gathered and discussed a plan to reopen on the 20th. The original banks, such as Hongda and Hengchang, have decided to close down. Yuanchang has not yet made a decision. Shengyuan has changed its bank name to Dachang. The other banks, such as Huichangyong, Huiyu, Baoxing, Chengzhang, Yisheng, Hengda, and Shengyu, are expected to reopen on time. The silk and cloth industries were affected by mutual price competition last year. After accounting, they could only barely cover expenses and did not have much profit. Apart from Hongxingtiansun Jin and other shops that had already closed down at the end of the year, it is now reported that Tianxiang Silk Shop is also struggling to survive. Hongda has not yet made a decision. Among the cloth industry, Chunhe, Yukang, and Yuanda have not been able to reopen. The others are expected to operate as usual. Guanghuo, Gu embroidery, and perfume, etc., have had difficulty maintaining operations due to sluggish business. They have all reduced the number of employees and tightened expenses. Although the rice, firewood, and food industries were affected by the low price of grain, they were still able to make a profit. As for silver shops, shoe stores, hat shops, copper and tin shops, and pharmacies, they mostly lost money.</p>

After a long period of preparation, the opening ceremony was held at the County Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on the 19th. The exhibition venue was located in the First Park. There were more than 20 participating manufacturers selling more than 30 categories of goods, such as silk and cloth, enamel, toothbrushes, and leather goods. In addition, there were more than 50 manufacturers displaying items. Local residents and representatives of various agencies and organizations went to participate, and the crowd was unusually large. The association also marked, "Not using domestic goods is tantamount to suicide, and loving foreign goods is equivalent to betraying the country" as the purpose of the meeting, which was quite alarming.</p>

(5) Longquan to Pucheng in northern Fujian. All are to be completed before June 15th. In addition, such as increasing freight transport, handling tax exemptions for highway land, rectifying additional duties, and increasing operating revenue. Also, because the routes are expanding, the bureau has decided to add two deputy directors to assist with engineering and business matters.

Now that he has finished his business, he arrived in Shanghai from Beijing by the night train the night before last and returned to his residence.

<p>Li said, "I am from Shenyang, but I haven't been to Tianjin for several years, so I took the opportunity to go there. The trip took five days. Because time was tight, I did not meet with anyone except for handling personal matters in Tianjin. Therefore, General Ma (Zhanshan) also did not go to visit. The situation in Xinjiang is complicated. I only saw the news in the papers about the Central Government sending me to Xinjiang to reorganize the old troops. Therefore, I don't know anything in detail. If the Central Government orders, we soldiers will not hesitate to go through fire and water. However, Xinjiang is a barren land, and the overland route from Gansu to Dihua alone is more than 4,000 li, which takes more than 40 days. News is also isolated and difficult to communicate. Sheng Shicai, the chairman, had about 2,000 troops when he first entered Xinjiang. Now he governs the three major commercial ports of Dihua, Tacheng, and Yili. Ma Zhongying is a Hui Muslim army with about 4,000 troops. Ma's strength is like the Northeast Volunteer Army. They are all local Hui Muslims who have joined. Among those who possess this strength in Xinjiang, the old troops from Jilin are about 8,000. Their livelihood, apart from rations, can be said to have no regular salary at all. Therefore, they are extremely distressed and have no other hope. They all hope that the Central Government can quickly formally reorganize them. Currently, the commanding officers in Xinjiang include Brigade Commander Zheng Runcheng, as well as Xing Zhanqing, Wang Xiaoxian, Gong Yinqing, and Hou Zhanbin. It is heard that the Central Government has sent Minister Huang to Xinjiang, which is probably true. I passed through Beijing twice but did not visit Premier Wang."</p>
<h3 id="e115">Methods for Settling Dependents <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>As for the officials and officers' dependents who previously transited through Russia to return to China, they are currently scattered in Tianjin, Shanghai, Ping [Beijing], and other places, numbering approximately 300. Their daily sustenance is quite difficult. I believe that those who are unable to feel at ease are precisely this group of helpless dependents. In the past, their maintenance relied on donations from various parties. Initially, the Central Party Headquarters in the capital collected over 40,000 yuan in donations. Subsequently, Mr. Wang Xiaolai and others in this city also contributed over 10,000 yuan. Recently, Deputy Commander Zhang (Xueliang) also allocated 5,000 yuan as maintenance funds for the dependents. Since their return to the country, a total of over 70,000 yuan has been spent. Since being forced to come to Shanghai, I have no possessions. If the dependents continue to drift about like this, their future livelihoods are quite worrying. Therefore, I have recently found several solutions: first, to provide financial assistance to the dependents to go to Xinjiang, so that wives, children, and fathers can be reunited; second, to enable the old troops to be reorganized by the central government, so that men can earn money and the dependents can support themselves. This matter is currently being vigorously pursued. My recent stay in Shanghai is not related to the attempted assassination of General Ma. The incident occurred after I had already left Tianjin en route, so I am completely unaware of the details. After speaking, he bid farewell and departed.</p>

<p>Because the Special Tax Has Not Yet Been Implemented in That Province</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Leather Silk Tobacco Industry Association, stating that local tobacco from Fujian must still be taxed according to the non-special tax area method when transported to Shanghai, which tobacco merchants found difficult to bear. The Chamber immediately forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for correction. It is now understood that the Chamber received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "The submitted documents are all understood. When local tobacco leaves were changed to the special tax system, the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian were originally designated as special tax areas. Subsequently, due to the fact that Fujian Province did not comply with the regulations to uniformly change all local tobacco leaves in the province to the special tax system, and with the occurrence of the Fujian Incident and the resulting chaos, it was even more difficult to implement the special tax for a time. The Ministry stipulated that local tobacco leaves and their manufactured tobacco silk from the province, when transported into other special tax provinces, should be taxed uniformly according to the non-special tax area method by the first competent special tax agency at the point of entry. The order has been circulated for compliance. Now that the chaos in Fujian has been quelled, whether the special tax on local tobacco in the province can be prepared immediately has been ordered by the Ministry to the provincial Stamp Tax Bureau of Tobacco and Alcohol to closely examine the situation and submit a reply for approval. The previous circumstances as stated in the presentation should be forwarded to the association for notification. This approval."</p>

<p>Seven Standing Committee Members Confer Once Yesterday</p>
<p>Issuing Securities, Not Public Bonds</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency, local report: Sixteen banks in this city, including the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, are issuing 30 million yuan in securities with the 44 million yuan loan from the Ministry of Finance, guaranteed by the Italian Boxer Indemnity Fund. It is planned to start circulating on the market on the 1st of the month. Currently, for the needs of the facts, sixteen banks have resolved to organize a syndicate to handle all affairs.

Yesterday, the seven standing committee members held a conference at the Bank Club at No. 4 Hong Kong Road and elected Li Fuxun as chairman. The address of the syndicate is currently under negotiation and will be decided within a few days. According to a certain key figure within the syndicate who spoke to a reporter from the Shenshi News Agency yesterday, the securities issued by the sixteen banks this time are a type of company securities, not public bonds, because only the government has the right to issue public bonds, and the terminology and nature are clearly different and should not be confused.</p>

<p>No. 3 Peideli, Limei Road, Nanshi</p>
<p>In recent years, the rural economy has fallen into bankruptcy, which has attracted the attention of all parties. The reason for the bankruptcy of the rural economy is naturally due to the low prices of agricultural products and the inconvenience for farmers to directly transport and sell them to the market. Therefore, rescuing the rural economy by only focusing on circulating rural finance without paying attention to the transportation and sale of farmers' products will not thoroughly solve their livelihoods. In view of this, the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank has specially prepared to set up the "Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Agricultural Product Sales Office" so that farmers can receive help from the seedling stage to the production of grain sales. It is learned that the purpose of the Agricultural Product Sales Office is to specialize in acting as an agent for the transportation and sale of the products of the central transportation and sales cooperatives and farmers throughout the province. The preparatory office has already started work, located at No. 3 Peideli, Limei Road, Nanshi. The director is temporarily served concurrently by Hou Houpei, deputy manager of the Farmers Bank headquarters, and the deputy director is Mr. Hu Duming.</p>

<p>Yangjia Bang in Pudong is Quite Suitable</p>
<p>Proceeding with Land Purchase Matters and Starting Construction Immediately</p>
<p>The alcohol factory planned by the Ministry of Industry has a confirmed capital of one million yuan, and the factory site will be located in Pudong, this city. The factory will produce industrial alcohol, which can supply one-half of the national consumption. The preparation director, Mr. Huang Jiangquan, is actively proceeding with the project. Yesterday, Mr. Huang visited Pudong to inspect the factory site and found that Yangjia Bang in Pudong was more suitable. There are more than one hundred mu of vacant land in that location, which will be requisitioned by the Ministry of Industry to the Municipal Government in accordance with the National Land Requisition Ordinance. The factory's capital is tentatively set at one million yuan, with official and commercial shares each accounting for half. The commercial shares of 500,000 yuan have been raised, and the official shares can also be allocated within a few days. Therefore, land purchase matters are now underway in order to start construction and start shipping goods as soon as possible.</p>

<p>China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong route, after the No. 16 aircraft was damaged in the fog, had reduced its schedule due to only the No. 17 aircraft being available for round trips, resulting in only one round trip per week. Towards the end of last month, the new aircraft ordered from the United States finally arrived in Shanghai. After assembly was completed, the original plan was to resume southbound flights this Friday (the 23rd). The company had already notified the post office to seal and send airmail destined for Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou on Friday morning. Now, due to insufficient preparation, the resumption of southbound flights has been postponed to next Friday (March 2nd). Additionally, the northbound flights on this route, which depart from Guangzhou every Wednesday and Saturday and fly to Fuzhou for an overnight stay, before flying from northern Fujian to Shanghai the next morning, will now stop overnight in Xiamen starting from March 2nd. All of this was officially communicated to the Postal Administration yesterday, which then relayed it to the post offices along the route for their information and implementation.</p>

<p>Xi Dejiong, Director of the Disaster Relief Group of the National Government's Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, was previously ordered to inspect the disaster situation in the affected areas. Mr. Xi has completed his inspection and submitted a report on the inspection and relief efforts. The original text is excerpted below: (Omission of official titles) "After arriving in Kaifeng, Dejiong inspected the investigation and relief work in Henan Province, and went to the disaster-stricken areas of Lanfeng and Kaocheng to conduct inquiries. Tang Zongguo, Director of the Hebei Investigation and Relief Office, and Du Yannian, Director of the Shandong Investigation and Relief Office, arrived in Bian at the same time due to important matters requiring face-to-face discussion. Therefore, all directors were summoned to discuss and resolve the difficulties in each area, and they were ordered to return to their respective provinces to perform their duties. Dejiong then traveled to Shandong for on-site investigation. As for the relief efforts in Hebei and the relief for the Shijiazhuang ice disaster, a plan has been agreed upon with the directors. The disaster relief shelters and porridge kitchens have accommodated a large number of disaster victims. Births and deaths are inevitable. It is now planned that in the future, when such incidents occur, a certain amount of national currency will be given to each person as special condolence money. In addition, the Luoyang Disaster Relief Orphanage houses a large number of orphans from the Yellow River disaster, which is very pitiful. The investigation and relief office has been ordered to provide appropriate subsidies. Many disaster victims in the areas north of the Yellow River are still in the water and urgently need relief. Taking Hua County as an example, many disaster victims have recently escaped from the water, and relief measures are being discussed with the Henan Provincial Government to relocate them to western Henan for food. If this is successful, it is planned to extend it to the three counties in southern Hebei. Daokou is a key area close to the disaster area, and there is concern that disaster victims will gather and have no place to live. A migrant reception center has been ordered to be established. The reception center in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, which houses disaster victims, is concerned that they will become lazy after being well-fed and clothed. The management personnel have been instructed to find ways to teach them work so that the center will not become a refuge for the starving after a month or two. In the disaster area of southern Hebei, the floodwater has not receded, and the disaster victims are dying. Three more porridge kitchens have been added. There are also many refugees in the disaster area of Shandong, and one more porridge kitchen has been added to provide relief."</p>

<p>Wuzhi County Water Drainage and Irrigation Project Completed</p>
<p>Last year, the Yellow River flooded, inundating dozens of counties in Henan, Shandong, and Hebei provinces. The National Government specially formed the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee to handle disaster relief and dike closure. In terms of work relief, except for the breaches at Changyuan and Shijiazhuang, the rest have been completed. The Shijiazhuang breach has been under construction, and during the ice jam period around the end of the lunar year, it was damaged by ice. The Disaster Relief Group in Wuzhi County, Henan Province, has completed the water drainage and irrigation project in the low-lying area, releasing over a hundred hectares of farmland. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>Ice Damage</p>
<p>The work relief group reported the situation of the Fenglou project during the ice jam, according to Sun Qingze, Director of the Second District Works Department: "At 3 PM on the 12th, a piece of melting ice on the west bank of the third breach flowed to the west end of the ice prevention pile, breaking two sections of the railroad track and losing five large piles. The other end of the ice hit the dam body near Daoshu, but fortunately, it remained stable. After a while, the ice moved slightly again, breaking two middle large piles. Large pieces of ice have not yet flowed through the breach. If the ice melts and flows straight down, it is feared that all the piles will not be able to hold. However, the diversion channel is in good shape. The second and third diversion channels are 1.5 meters deeper than on the 9th. The water in the main river is rising daily. The water level at Shijiazhuang has not changed. At 3 PM on the 13th, large ice blocks below the diversion channel broke away from the edge and moved downwards. Nine more ice prevention piles were lost. Only two slanting, remaining piles are left west of the mouth of the cutoff dam, and six large piles remain on the east side of the mouth, and ten more to the east. The lost wooden piles and railroad tracks have all sunk into the water, and large pieces of ice are still stuck between the large piles of the cutoff dam. At 2 PM on the 14th, the ice in the main river moved, and seven more large piles at the Fenglou mouth were broken. The ice on the east and west wings piled up to the top, and several small piles of ice protection boards were broken. The dam body is stable, and the mouth has been washed by ice for three hours. Large pieces of ice are now stuck in between, slightly hindering the flow. The ice in the diversion channel and the main river has melted, and the situation is still good. However, funds are lacking and urgently need to be replenished."</p>

<p>Water Drainage and Irrigation</p>
<p>Wuzhi County, Henan Province (west of the Pinghan Railway on the north bank of the Yellow River), has low-lying terrain. The floodwater after the Yellow River disaster has not receded completely. The area is twenty li from east to west and ten li from north to south, a vast expanse of water. The Yellow River Disaster Relief Group believed that the stagnant water not only made transportation inconvenient, but also made it difficult to plant wheat. In the spring, the evaporation of the water would cause a foul odor and be harmful to health. Therefore, they designed to dig rivers and canals to drain the stagnant water and irrigate the nearby fields. They recruited disaster victims to work, digging a main canal south of Bali Gang Village, about two li long. At the end point, they dug a horizontal canal, about eight zhang to the north and over a hundred zhang to the south. They dug several well openings in the horizontal canal and used water wheels to irrigate the nearby fields. It is said that it only took two weeks to complete the entire project, releasing over 11,000 mu of fertile land and irrigating over 2,000 mu of land next to the irrigation canal.</p>

<p>Red Swastika Society Relief Team Working in Fujian</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society previously sent two relief teams to Fujian Province due to the military disaster. It has been over a month. It is now reported that the Shanghai General Office of the Society received reports from the two teams yesterday, detailing the relief work in Fujian. The details are excerpted below: The North China Relief Team entered Fujian by land last month, passing through Quzhou to Jiangshan, then Pucheng, Jian'ou, and Yanping. It was found that Yanping was besieged by the Red Army from September to November. The food in the city was cut off, and the people were extremely distressed. The north and south passes were burned down, with over 500 civilian houses destroyed. The situation was tragic. The recent war made the people even more destitute. Team leader Nie Chengling sent personnel to investigate the disaster areas and found over 200 households with over 800 people in dire need of relief. Each person was given two yuan for emergency relief. The disaster situation in the seventh and eighth districts and Shunchang County was also serious and is currently under investigation. After arriving in Fuzhou, the Southeast Joint Relief Team organized two convalescent hospitals to treat wounded soldiers and civilians. However, wounded soldiers were scattered throughout the city, living in ancestral halls and nunneries, mostly without clothing or bedding. Six or seven out of ten died from injuries and illnesses. A temporary hospital has been established at the Fuzhou Xiadu Fire Brigade to accommodate soldiers and civilians with serious illnesses. After they recover, they will be sent back to their hometowns. It has been found that soldiers from the 19th Route Army with household registration in Guangdong have all been sent back to Guangdong. Most of the rest remain in the provincial capital. In addition, many civilian houses in Xiadou Town, thirty li from the province, were burned down, and the people had no place to live. An investigation found 33 extremely poor households with a total of 78 people. They were divided into "Swastika" and "Relief" categories. "Swastika" category: 5 yuan per large mouth, 2 yuan per small mouth. "Relief" category: 4 yuan per large mouth, 2 yuan per small mouth. Furthermore, no less than several thousand refugees from the bandit disasters in Tai Ning, Jian Ning, and Chong'an counties fled to the province one after another. They have been stranded for over a year and cannot return. Local public groups have established 26 reception centers, but there are still several hundred people outside who have not been accommodated. Many of them are sick. The team has sent personnel to distribute 1,800 bottles of emergency medicine to each center and has selectively provided relief money to the elderly, weak, women, and children for medical treatment. In addition, the military excavation of trenches around the Longshan waist in Fuzhou destroyed hundreds of graves. The team has sent personnel to bury them. Xiangsi Ridge in Yongtai Town was an area of fierce fighting between the two armies, with over a thousand casualties. Although the local authorities have buried them, there are still corpses in the mountain streams and thickets. The team has sent laborers to bury them.</p>

<p>Jisheng Society Continues Work Relief in Jiangxi Province</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Society has been carrying out work relief in Jiangxi Province for the past year to repair embankments. The three embankments, Dayou, Fuyou, and Guangfeng, have been completed one after another. It has been over a year and a considerable amount of money has been spent. The Guangfeng Embankment sluice gate could not be completed at the time because the water had already surged up, making it impossible to work. Now, the Society, in order to prevent the surge of spring water, must rush to complete the project. Therefore, it has been decided that Mr. Li Yunmen will be publicly recommended to take charge on the 23rd of this month to continue the work and complete it as soon as possible. However, China's water conservancy, such as the counties of Heze in western Shandong and the various prefectures of Henan Province, has not been repaired in many places. The spring water is expected to be dangerous soon, and disaster victims are everywhere. Farmers have no hope of production. It is hoped that patriotic people and those who are enthusiastic about charity will rise up and work hard to continue their work.</p>

<p>Sternfield's Case of Contending for Rice Carrying, Carrying Permit Has Been Revoked</p>
<p>Since Sternfield, the head of the shoulder carriers, organized the Hongtai Shoulder Carrying Company and forcibly seized the work of rice carts, a strike by the rice industry occurred. The Social Bureau once invited the Municipal Party Department, the Public Security Bureau, and all parties involved to discuss and decide on four solutions. The original text has been published in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the first three of the solutions have been prepared and implemented by the Social Bureau. As for the fourth item regarding the permit of Sternfield, the head of the shoulder carriers, after the Municipal Chamber of Commerce petitioned the Municipal Government to revoke it, the Public Security Bureau has revoked the permit and registered it for cancellation.</p>

<p>The Public Works Department's Health Department's work report for January stated: "The public has been warned about the spread of smallpox. In late January, it spread quite severely. Although the public has paid attention to this, only 16,730 people have been vaccinated by the Health Department, which cannot be considered many. The municipal water supply had a salty taste at the end of January. This is a common phenomenon every year due to the shallow water of the Yangtze River and the high tide. A physical examination of students was held at the Huade Road Primary School, with a total of 662 students. The results are currently being considered. What can be said is that the proportion of students suffering from preventable diseases is too high.</p>

<p>Birth and Death Statistics</p>
<p>The number of births is estimated at 19.07 per thousand for foreigners. This number is still below the actual number because births may not be attended by doctors. For the Chinese, 177 births were reported. This is only a small fraction of the total number. The reason for this record is to hope that the public and the medical community will be aware of this registration system and cooperate to gradually obtain more reliable numbers. The death rate for foreigners is 12.38, which is lower than the average. For the Chinese, as far as is known, it is 16.33, which is higher than the same month last year, but still lower than the average. The most common deaths from infectious diseases are tuberculosis, smallpox, and typhoid fever.</p>

<p>Infectious Diseases</p>
<p>Smallpox and influenza have increased among foreigners. Among the Chinese, there were 63 reported cases of smallpox, with 42 deaths. Among them, 30 were sent to the Chinese Isolation Hospital. It was found that only 6 had been vaccinated against smallpox, and all were vaccinated in their youth. Scarlet fever has increased seasonally, but not drastically. As for influenza, as many as 10 Chinese people died from it. In addition, rashes have also increased sharply. Parents of all schoolchildren must pay attention to the initial fever of children and take precautions early to avoid many dangers.</p>

<p>The production of milk this month exceeded all previous records. The samples were subjected to bacterial examination and were very satisfactory, even for grade B milk. However, after chemical examination, 4 grade B milk samples failed. The supply of meat was normal, but the number of pigs slaughtered increased by 8% due to the approaching Spring Festival. The situation in the vegetable markets was quite satisfactory. Bakeries were still inspected in the early morning and at night. Cases of violating licensing regulations were tried quickly in the Special District Court, which greatly benefited the work of the Licensing Department.</p>

Except for those in very poor condition, all are being gradually changed to avoid difficulties. After all, it would be very difficult to suddenly order large-scale reforms in old stores that have been around for many years.</p>

Currently, Wang Zhenqiu, Dai Enrong, Yuan Zhenhai, Li Qishan, and 34 others have come to Shanghai to make a living after being treated in hospitals in Beiping. A reporter from the Heping News Agency visited them at their hotel yesterday. According to them, "Our hometowns are mostly in the Northeast, which has now fallen into the territory of the puppet state. Because we cannot return to our hometowns and we are all disabled, it is difficult to make a living. We have no choice but to come to Shanghai to make a living. We are residing in hotels, living alone and relying on each other. Life is difficult. We are now appealing to Shanghai philanthropists Xu Shiying, Zhu Ziqiao, and others to find a way to provide relief so that we can maintain our lives." It is learned that Xu and others, recognizing that the end of a hero is the same throughout history, have agreed to find a way to arrange for them.</p>

<p>Escorted to Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday and Now Detained in the Municipal Public Security Bureau Awaiting Interrogation</p>
<p>Since the major case of plotting to assassinate former Finance Minister Song Ziwen at the North Railway Station, in which Song's confidential secretary Tang Yulu was shot and killed on the spot, the police agencies of this city have conducted investigations and successively arrested many people. However, the main criminal in this case, named Liu Gang, remained at large. A secret order was issued to strictly arrest and bring him to justice. It was unexpected that Liu had fled to other ports after the incident and finally hid in Xiamen. It was not until February 3rd of this year that Huang Bin and Hu Zhen, officers of the Xiamen Public Security Bureau, learned of his whereabouts and arrested him. On the 12th, they urgently telegraphed Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen. They then received a reply telegram from Mayor Wu ordering that the criminal be escorted to Shanghai starting immediately. The Xiamen Public Security Bureau immediately ordered Secretary Lin Woping to accompany the original officers Huang and Hu to escort Liu on the Jinan ship. They arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 19th). Bureau Chief Wen sent personnel to the dock to welcome the criminal to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Qian Shaofeng's Great Revenge Has Been Avenged, Sentenced to Seven Years in Prison</p>
<p>激於義憤甘冒萬險</p>
<p>Driven by Righteous Indignation, Willing to Risk Everything</p>
<p>錢樹聲律師之陳情</p>
<p>Attorney Qian Shusheng's Petition</p>
<p>Qian Shaofeng, also known as Peihao, a 21-year-old college student from An'nan County, Guizhou, whose father, Qian Bin, served as the Director of the Finance Bureau of An'nan, was killed on March 5th, 1931 by the county magistrate, He Zunfu, a fellow villager, under the pretext of carrying out orders from superiors, in collusion with Zhou Haitao, the company commander of the local garrison. Shaofeng, determined to avenge his father, went out to study alone, traveling to Beiping, Hubei, Nanjing, and other places. He came to Shanghai last year and resided at No. 13 Yuanchang Lane, Hualong Road, French Concession. On the evening of October 16th, he encountered his enemy, He Zunfu, watching a movie at the Golden Grand Theater in Baxianqiao. Shaofeng followed him with a knife, bought a ticket to enter the theater, and hid behind He. Taking the opportunity, he stabbed He to death to avenge his father. After committing the crime, he abandoned the murder weapon and was intercepted by patrols when he fled the theater. He was taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special District Local Court, where he was prosecuted for murder. After questioning, the court sent a document to the An'nan government to investigate whether Qian's father was indeed killed by He and Zhou, and received a reply to the case. The trial resumed on the 12th of this month. Because the plaintiff, He Rong (He Zunfu's son), did not have his lawyer present, the defendant hired lawyer Qian Shusheng to defend him, stating that the defendant was driven by righteous indignation and willing to risk everything. His actions were sufficient to request a reduction in punishment. The debate was adjourned until the next day, and the closing arguments were heard pending sentencing. The situation has been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday was the sentencing date. At 10 AM, the police sent a detective to escort Qian to the court. Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the First Criminal Court and sentenced Qian Shaofeng to seven years in prison for murder. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day. The murder weapon will be confiscated. After the sentencing, the defendant was ordered to be transferred to the detention center pending further instructions during the appeal period.</p>

<p>The Great America Evening Post said that the British Consular Police Court this morning resumed the trial of the case of Mark, a British national of the Puxiyang Company, accused of defrauding a huge sum from the Maijia Li Bank. First, witness Mr. Ke Mingxian claimed that an accountant named Oubai paid him with several fake checks and then fled. Later, the French police found that he lived in Room 256, Apartment No. 7, Lüban Road. Miss Kailai, who wrote to the British-American Tobacco Company seeking employment in order to obtain a signed reply from a senior executive of the company, also lived in the same room. Next, the American Mr. Watson claimed that he and his brother were both directors of Puxiyang Company. After the Mark case occurred, both had resigned. The affairs of the company were handled by Mark. He and his brother had received a check for director's fees paid by Mark, totaling 800 yuan, which was signed by Sokorov. Next, a Japanese engraver testified that he had undertaken to make engraving plates commissioned by two Russians. The Italian Tangbulini and his son, employed by Mark, will be tried by the Italian Consular Court next Tuesday. In addition, the Portuguese Paputistai, an employee of the Maijia Li Bank, is currently being tried by the Portuguese Consular Court and will be transferred to Macau next week for further trial.</p>
<h3 id="e168">The Two-Route Administration Improves the Songhu Branch Line <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Thirteen Improvement Cases Resolved</p>
<p>The Traffic Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Two-Route Administration, in order to improve the Songhu branch line of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, specially convened a traffic meeting to discuss the following improvement cases: (1) The line is very short, with few first-class passengers, and seats are often wasted. It is proposed to reduce the original sixteen first-class seats by eight, and at the same time expand third-class seats to make adjustments. (The Administration ordered the complete abolition of first-class seats, regardless of class, charging all fares at the third-class rate, and at the same time increasing equipment on the vehicles, striving for cleanliness, which shall be handled jointly by the Mechanical and Traffic Departments.) (2) The turnout lines at each station on the branch line, except for the Jiangwan Station, are very short, only enough for two steam locomotives to stop. When trains meet that are longer than two steam locomotives, accidents are likely to occur. If both trains are longer than two steam locomotives, they cannot meet. It is proposed to lengthen them to facilitate traffic. Also, the platforms at Gaoxing Temple and Yunzaobang stations are too short, making it inconvenient for passengers to get on and off, and they must also be lengthened to ensure safety. (The Administration ordered the Engineering Department to study and estimate the costs for review.) (3) The railings at each station on the line are mostly very short, causing passengers to leave the station without going through the ticket barrier. It is not easy to crack down on those riding without tickets. It is proposed to extend the railings at each station to the branching points at both ends, and set up gates, operated by the switchmen, and prohibit idlers from entering and exiting to prevent abuses. (The Administration ordered the Engineering Department to study and estimate the costs.) (4) Although the applicable period of validity for regular tickets on the line is clearly stated on the ticket, the font is small and not easily noticed in a hurry, making it easy for holders to misuse them. It is proposed to add prominent large characters to these tickets to make them easier to identify, and to use two-sided transparent clear corner sleeves to prevent damage and blurring. (The Accounting Department was ordered to follow this procedure when printing tickets.) (5) Passengers on the line often carry local products and goods, and vendors often bring goods onto the train. Because of the regulations, they must pay freight, which often leads to disputes. It is now proposed to formulate other measures so that baggage that can be carried by one person and does not take up space will be exempt from freight to benefit merchants and travelers. (The Traffic Department was ordered to revise and submit detailed remedial measures for review.) In addition, attention should be paid to locomotives and coal to avoid delays, and the original steam locomotives should be repaired to increase the number of trips. The Mechanical Department was ordered to handle this diligently. As for personnel matters, the Traffic Department plans to redistribute them, and it has been approved to handle this carefully within the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3 id="e169">New Development of the Fruit and Produce Industry, Exporting Domestically Produced Fruit to England for Trial Sales <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Notice to Gentlemen and Ladies of All Nations to Try Chinese Specialties</p>
<p>Replicating Foreign Market Decorations for Beauty and Hygiene</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, given that our country's fruits are rarely sold overseas, resulting in the absence of Chinese fruits in overseas markets, in order to seek overseas development, convened leaders of fruit merchants in this city in mid-October of last year to discuss ways to open overseas fruit markets. It was decided to first try selling to Liverpool, England. Preparations have been completed to date. The following is an inquiry to the industry for details:</p>
<p>Decorating for Export to England: According to the person in charge of the Fruit and Produce Industry Association of this city, the fruit for trial sales to England, which was decided last year, includes Ya pears, chestnuts, ginkgo nuts, and dried jujubes. They were prepared long ago, but have been delayed due to the lack of refrigerated compartments on the ships. On the 11th of this month, a British Taikoo liner sailed from Shanghai to England, with many refrigerated compartments, which can store fruit for a long time without spoiling. It was decided to ship the above types of fruit on this liner.</p>
<p>Notice to All Nations: After the industry shipped the above-mentioned fruits by British liner, in order to promote the attention of people of all countries to the advantages of Chinese fruits, a notice was issued, stating, "China is located in the temperate zone, with fertile soil and abundant agricultural products and fresh vegetables. The pears and chestnuts of Tianjin, the long pears of Shandong, the pomelos of Guangdong, the Guangqiao of Shantou, the peaches and apricots of Zhejiang, and other famous fruits from various places are all well-known at home and abroad. Their excellent quality and delicious flavor have long been admired by foreign countries. Modern planting methods are improving day by day, and attention to preservation and hygiene is also extremely complete. We have specially selected famous fruits from the four seasons to present to the gentlemen and ladies of Europe and America. We hope you will try them."</p>
<p>Beautiful Decoration: The pears for this trial sale to England are divided into three types: No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, all packed in wooden boxes. No. 1 has 200 pears per box, No. 2 has 250 pears per box, and No. 3 has 300 pears per box. Chestnuts and ginkgo nuts are packed in burlap sacks, each weighing 100 pounds. The decorations used are no different from those commonly used in the British market, and are extremely beautiful and lovely. The trademark adopts the Boy Scout brand, with a drawing of a Boy Scout holding a wooden stick, showing British spirit and boldness. Each fruit package has a label attached for easy identification.</p>
<p>Fruit Characteristics: The origin of the above fruits is as follows: Pears are produced in Shandong, green when raw, turning yellow when ripe, with a pointed shape and a round stem. When eating, the skin and core are removed. Boiling the juice is called pear paste, which can be used for medicinal purposes. Eating raw quenches thirst and generates fluids, and eating cooked clears the lungs and resolves phlegm, tastes delicious and is full of juice. Chestnuts are produced in Zhejiang, Tianjin, and other places. Eating cooked benefits qi and tonifies the kidneys, and is the most beneficial of all fruits. Ginkgo nuts are produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, with a pointed and round shape. The flesh is light green when tender, turning yellow over time. They can only be eaten cooked, warming the lungs and benefiting qi, and providing beneficial nutrition.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Doctor of Incantations Jiang Lichu Shot and Killed by Robbers <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Robbers Ultimately Stole Nothing, Took Not a Penny</p>
<p>The Maid Li Hu's Right Cheek Also Struck by a Bullet</p>
<p>Jiang Lichu, a native of Yangzhou, was 53 years old and lived at No. 5, Lane 330 (Pingle Lane), Xizang Road, in the Public Concession. He practiced incantation medicine, and his livelihood was fairly good. Suddenly, yesterday at about 3:30 PM, five robbers came, each holding a pistol, wearing blue and black cloth gowns, and wearing woolen hats, speaking with a local accent. One robber was on guard at the front door, one was guarding the back door, and three robbers went straight to Jiang's consulting room in the west wing downstairs. At that time, Jiang was taking a nap and had not gotten up. Only Jiang's youngest daughter was in the consulting room. The robbers immediately asked the girl if she was surnamed Jiang, and forbade her to make a sound. The girl, seeing this situation, knew things were not good, and could not help but cry out. Jiang heard his beloved daughter's cry in the back room, hurriedly put on his clothes and walked out. The robbers had already entered the back room. Jiang immediately grabbed the wrist of one robber. While they were struggling, the robber next to him fired a shot at the floor, ordering Jiang to let go. The robbers retreated to the front consulting room, and Jiang also followed. Suddenly, the robber guarding the back door, hearing the gunshot inside, thought that the matter had gone wrong, and planned to go through the reception hall to investigate. At that time, Li Hu, a 60-year-old maid surnamed Qi, was walking down from upstairs. The robber, seeing her, immediately grabbed her, asking her if she was surnamed Jiang and where she lived, and ordered her to lead the way. At this time, Jiang and the robbers had already struggled from the consulting room to the reception hall, and at the same time, two robbers had already walked out the front door, and two robbers were also about to leave the house. Jiang and the old woman Li Hu, in shock and confusion, lost their minds and unconsciously followed them out. When the robbers saw this, thinking that they were about to be followed and arrested, they were greatly panicked, and fired a shot at the maid Li Hu first. The bullet entered from her right cheek and exited from the root of her left ear, and she fell to the ground on the spot, bleeding profusely. Jiang Lichu, seeing this, immediately retreated and crouched under the window. Suddenly, the second shot flew from his side, hitting Jiang's right chest. The bullet did not exit, and he fell to the ground in a pool of blood on the spot. The robbers then calmly escaped. When the police arrived after receiving the news, the robbers had long since fled. They immediately reported to the police station, and a car was sent to rush Jiang and the old woman Li Hu to Renji Hospital on Shandong Road for treatment. However, Jiang died on the way due to his serious injuries, and was sent to the coroner's office to await examination. The old woman Li Hu was not in serious condition. After hearing the news, the reporter went to investigate. According to Jiang's youngest daughter, the robbers never stole a penny or anything, and it was impossible to guess what they meant. She pointed out the location where her father was injured, where blood was flowing all over the ground, and the stench was overwhelming. A woolen hat worn by the maid Li Hu was still soaked in blood, and the scene was extremely tragic.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Wu Huatai Suggests Setting Up a Fire Safety Net <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>If a Ten-Story Building is Careless</p>
<p>A Net Opens to Ensure Absolute Safety</p>
<p>Lawyer Wu Huatai wrote in a letter to the editor of Shen Bao, saying, "Dear Editor of Shen Bao, I, Huatai, having seen the shortcomings in Shanghai's fire-fighting equipment, am now writing to the fire departments of the Chinese and foreign concessions to make a suggestion. The letter reads: I am writing to inform you that the Shanghai area is well-maintained in terms of safety, and the fire department can be said to be unique. They arrive as soon as they are reported, and can extinguish the fire in a few minutes. The quality of their work is such that even in the West, it is no more than this. However, in recent years, new buildings in Shanghai have tended to increase in height. Residential buildings have four or five stories, and skyscrapers with more than ten stories are even more impressive. Such prosperity and large-scale construction cannot be said to be a bad phenomenon for the city, but it inevitably has some shortcomings in terms of fire protection. In the event of a fire on the lower floors, it is often difficult for those on the top floors to escape. Although the fire department has rescue ladders, when there are many people and they are anxious and panicked, they all want to be the first to escape, and will certainly not be able to maintain order and climb the ladder one by one. In such a situation, it is inevitable that not everyone can be guaranteed safety. Furthermore, for high buildings with more than ten stories, I am afraid that the fire department's ladders will not reach. At this time, a rescue net is indispensable. The rescue net (also known as a safety net) is made of extremely thick ropes, tied into a grid of five or six zhang in length and width. When the building is too high for the ladder to reach, this net can be used, with hooks on the four corners, or pulled open by manpower, so that those who cannot escape can jump down from above and be safe. This equipment is small in area and costs very little, and is truly easy and inexpensive, and greatly benefits fire protection. Rather than digging a well when thirsty, it is better to prepare for a rainy day. Moreover, this method has been practiced in Western countries for a long time, but the fire departments in Shanghai have not yet done so. In my opinion, Shanghai is a major trading port with a dense population and prosperous commerce, and should plan for this as soon as possible. If it has not been created in the past, it should be emulated in the future. Therefore, I dare to offer my humble opinion, and I do not know whether I can invite your department to adopt and prepare it. I am writing this letter with great anticipation. Sincerely, (Omitted below) I think your newspaper is the voice of the citizens, and will certainly support this. I hope you will promote it with sympathy to promote its success. Whether it is appropriate or not, please advise. I am very grateful. Respectfully wishing you good writing."</p>

<p>The Zi Lin Daily News reported that the Blue Funnel Line's Philoctetes, which was recently damaged in a collision with the China Merchants Bureau's Puan steamer outside the Songkou, is currently being repaired at the Yesson Dockyard. The ship belongs to Alfred Holt &amp; Co. of Liverpool, England, and is one of the largest and heaviest ships to enter the Shanghai Dockyard for repairs. The ship is 528 feet long, 63 feet wide, and has a gross weight of 11,500 tons. It will take about a week to leave the dock, and then other repairs will be carried out, so it will not be able to leave Shanghai for a while.</p>

<p>Appellant Reportedly Applied for a Change of Venue</p>
<p>The case of Ji Juemi and the woman Yu Xiaomei being sued for obscenity was initially judged by the First Special District Court to be not guilty. However, Xu Li, the legal guardian of the plaintiff Xu Yuying, was not satisfied with the original judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The trial was originally scheduled to open in the First Criminal Court of the Second High Court yesterday afternoon, but neither party arrived on time, nor did any lawyers appear in court. Later, after the trial judges Zhao Yu, Zhou Han, and Jiang Shuzi retired from the court after hearing other appeals, they approved the case of Ji and Xu submitted by the police station on a single sheet and waited for verification. It is reported that the appellant had filed an application for a change of venue with the Second High Court, and the trial date was temporarily postponed.</p>

<p>Postponed Due to Unreceived Reply from the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Each Defendant Ordered to Remain on Original Bail</p>
<p>Qi Chufa of Shaoxing, due to setting up the Ruitai Silver Furnace at No. 20, Yixing Lane, Qipulu, and No. 41, Tiantong Road, specializing in melting silver ingots, was previously discovered by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Because Qi and others violated the order issued by the Ministry of Finance to abolish taels and change to yuan, they dispatched Detective Hu Kui Sheng at 7:30 PM on the 2nd of this month, reported to the First Special District Court, signed out a search warrant, and, with the assistance of Chinese Detective Liang Yuliang of the Municipal Police Station, went to the above two places and arrested the owners Qi Chufa, Qian Guoxun, Zhou Huilin, Chen Jinshan, Shen Yushu, Tong Dasheng, and others, confiscating 26 silver ingots, 879 double-cornered silvers, 62 pounds of broken silver, and clay models, and brought them to the Special Court. After a preliminary interrogation, Qi was ordered to pay 3,000 yuan bail, Qian, Chen, and Shen each paid 500 yuan bail, and Zhou and Tong each paid a shop guarantee to be summoned at any time and waited for interrogation. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was the date of the continued interrogation. The Public Works Department was still represented by Lawyer Jiang Baolian, and the defendants were represented by Lawyers Yan Yiping and Wu Baotai. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also appointed Legal Counsel Zhan Jifeng to appear in court and requested a postponement. Trial Judge Wu Tingqi immediately announced, "This case is being postponed. This court has sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to submit evidence. According to the reply, it stated that this case has been reported to the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, asking about the ban on privately destroying national currency and the measures to be taken. The reply has not yet been received, so this case must still be postponed." He then ordered each defendant to remain on their original bail and wait for the rescheduled hearing on the morning of March 13.</p>

<p>Sailing Between Shanghai and Annam</p>
<p>Maiden Voyage on the 23rd</p>
<p>The British Taikoo Steamship Company, whose shipping operations on various rivers and seas last year were deeply affected by the economic downturn and the Guangzhou strike, found it difficult to make a profit overall, suffering considerable losses. However, they have been constantly researching and improving the ships used, gradually decommissioning older ships that consumed more coal and building new-style ships that were more fuel-efficient and had greater productivity. Two new ocean liners have been added to the North and South Seas routes, one being the Yuezhou, built by the Glasgow Dockyard in the United Kingdom, with a displacement of 2,800 tons, a length of 298 feet, a width of 44 feet, and a draft of 17 feet, with 17 officer cabins. The ship is mainly used for cargo transportation and has great speed, capable of traveling 14 nautical miles per hour, while being extremely fuel-efficient. In order to develop the South China shipping industry, the ship has been specially assigned to sail from Shanghai to Swatow and Guangzhou, and then to Haikou and Beihai, and directly to Haiphong to connect the Shanghai-Annam route. There are many overseas Chinese traveling on this route, and there are no ships sailing from Shanghai. The ship arrived in Shanghai from London yesterday and began loading cargo today. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on its maiden voyage to Haiphong at 10:00 AM on the 23rd. The cargo has already been fully loaded. Furthermore, the company's North Seas regular ship, after adding the new Shengyang ship last year, has greater productivity. Therefore, a new ocean liner of the same type has been ordered from its own factory in Hong Kong, named the Xin Shuntian, which can arrive in Shanghai in May of this year and be assigned to the Shanghai-Yantai-Qingdao-Tianjin route to compete in the market.</p>
<h3 id="e176">The Consolidated Tax Bureau Returns Detained Cigarettes <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Office of the Municipal Cigarette Trade Association previously received a letter from its member, Xielongchang, a freight forwarder at Cuifeng Wharf, requesting the return of 2,000 Small Beauty cigarettes that had been seized. The office immediately forwarded the situation to the Su-Zhe-Wan Consolidated Tax Bureau for certification and requested the return. They have now received a reply stating, "Merchants who wholesale and retail cigarettes should issue customers invoices with official stamps, so that they can be verified along the way. In this case, Xielongchang sold 2,000 Small Beauty cigarettes, but did not transport them with boxes bearing the verification stamp, nor did they issue an invoice with an official stamp, making it impossible to verify them. It was inappropriate to detain them. Since your association has sent boxes for verification and provided a letter of certification, after the boxes have been inspected by the Shanghai Inspection Office, they will be returned. Xielongchang should also be informed that when reselling cigarettes in the future, they must follow the prescribed procedures and not make any more mistakes." In addition to instructing the Shanghai Inspection Office, a corresponding letter has been replied. The association, based on this, immediately forwarded a letter to the company asking them to send someone to the office to retrieve the detained cigarettes, and instructed them to comply with the prescribed procedures in the future and not make any more mistakes, so as not to cause disputes.</p>

<p>More Than a Thousand Residents of Dayang Bridge Prevented Work Yesterday</p>
<p>Visiting Wang Binyan to Beg for Help and Submitting a Petition to the Administration</p>
<p>The residents of the Jiaotong Road area, due to the Two-Route Administration's construction of a concrete wall of more than 200 zhang along Jiaotong Road, are protesting the demolition of the wooden bridge on the east side of Dayang Bridge. The bridge crosses the railway and allows residents of Panjiawan in the south to interact with each other, with about 10,000 people passing through daily. It benefits merchants, facilitates workers, and maintains commerce. If the bridge is demolished, the livelihoods of more than a hundred merchants in the vicinity will be cut off. Therefore, they have repeatedly asked the Administration to avoid demolition, but to no avail. Yesterday, workers were building the wall in the area and demolishing the bridge, which was seen by all the residents, who urgently gathered more than a thousand people to prevent it.

<p>Photography is the most popular art internationally. Countries in Europe, America, and Japan all publish photography yearbooks annually to promote their photographic arts internationally. One can glimpse their artistic culture through these yearbooks. The earliest British photography yearbook has been published for seventy-three years, and the Japanese photography yearbook has reached its eighth year. When Europeans and Americans discuss Eastern photographic art, they often take Japanese works as representative, which is the merit of the yearbook. The Chinese photography community has long discussed publishing a yearbook, but due to various printing and distribution difficulties, it has not been realized. Last year, the Chinese Art Society prepared for publication, and with the support of contemporary master of Chinese painting and pioneer of artistic photography, Mr. Hu Boxiang, who agreed to be the chief editor, along with Zhu Shuren, a well-known researcher of photography, as the assistant editor, progress was very rapid. The yearbook's selection of materials is purely based on openness, with extremely broad collection and strict selection. Many works that are admired by peers but rarely seen by the public are included. The masterpieces of various artists include Qian Kanghou, Lin Hanlun, Huang Bohui, Gan Naiguang, Ding Song, Cai Junshan, Guo Shuliang, Guo Xiqi, Jiang Baoli, Zeng Zhongming, Shen Gao, Zhang Zhenhou, Huang Zhongzhang, Wu Zhongxing, Hu Boxizhou, Qian Jinghua, Lang Jingshan, Shu Xincheng, Fu Bingchang, Lu Shifu, Chen Wanli, Tong Boqu, Chen Chuanlin, Hu Junlei, Cai Jielu, Zhu Liwo, Zhang Liyun, Shao Woyun, and several well-known foreign writers such as Deng Tuo and Jia Hualu, totaling about seventy artists. The yearbook is printed entirely with two-color special editions and the finest paper. Printing has now begun, and it is said that after the yearbook's sample pages were sent to Europe and America, numerous congratulatory letters of praise from various countries have been received. The society is even more encouraged and expects to publish the book around March.</p>

<p>The Anti-Tuberculosis Association invited Dr. Yan Fuqing, President of the Chinese Red Cross Hospital, to give a lecture at the Gospel Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 17th at 8 PM. The lecture was very detailed. Here is a brief summary of his speech: According to the world's tuberculosis mortality statistics, China ranks first. This is unparalleled in the decline of national physique. Although the causes are very complex, the pathogen is the tubercle bacillus. After this bacterium invades the lungs, its nature is particularly stubborn, and treatment is often ineffective. Moreover, this disease is actually a contagious disease. 60% of children aged 10 to 15 are infected, and the number of infected adults is also considerable. It is truly terrifying. This must be prevented quickly. There are many methods: (1) Do not spit anywhere, do not cough at people, (2) Implement early treatment and X-ray examination, (3) All people suspected of having the disease should be regarded as contaminated with germs, so they should not be used by family members or outsiders, (4) People with the disease should be isolated for treatment, which can reduce the infection of more than three people, (5) Do not engage in excessive exercise, and other things such as not worrying and not overworking can all curb the spread of lung disease, which are also the keys to preventing lung disease. According to various countries in the world, the prevention of the rampant tuberculosis is unusually thorough. The United States spends 200 million gold yuan every year on tuberculosis prevention work, so the number of tuberculosis patients is decreasing day by day. Recently, celebrities from all walks of life have also organized a China Anti-Tuberculosis Association. Since its establishment, the number of members who have joined has been very enthusiastic. The purpose of the association is purely to prevent the occurrence of tuberculosis in the healthy public. If people from all walks of life wish to join, they only need to *** a small membership fee and will enjoy great benefits in the future.</p>

It is heard that in this city, the Yinghua Street Cixing Lane Fuli Tobacco Company is the manager of this cigarette.</p>

Therefore, Li Ze, Li Minzhou's nephew, has been specially appointed to continue as general manager. Mr. Li is young and talented, skilled in business management, and has been involved in commerce in Hong Kong and Guangdong, where he is trusted by all circles.

<p>▲ Laiyang Pear Paste is Truly a Cough Remedy: Ancient people said that pears should not be used in medicine, which is quite strange. In fact, pears are indeed effective in treating wind diseases and heat-related illnesses. However, eating too many fresh pears can harm the spleen, as the ancients have repeatedly said. If pears are decocted into a paste, the drawbacks are eliminated and the benefits are enhanced. The best pears are the fragrant pears of Laiyang, Shandong. The Qiancheng Company on Tongfu Road in this city distributes Laiyang pear paste produced by the Dongya Company of Yantai, marked with a "Round Longevity" trademark. It is indeed different from the ordinary pear paste sold on the market. It functions to resolve phlegm, relieve coughs, moisturize the lungs, and reduce fire. During the cold spring season, colds and coughs are often considered minor ailments, but if not treated properly, they can easily turn into serious illnesses. If Laiyang pear paste is taken regularly, it will invariably show immediate results.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, According to the claimant Ms. Fan Chen, the report in your newspaper on the 17th regarding the case of Fan Fayuan being accused of forging documents is inconsistent with the facts. Her husband, Fan Fayuan, initiated and opened the Bodhisattva Restaurant two years ago, which is not a hostel but purely a restaurant. This should be corrected. Furthermore, all those listed as initiators were close friends, and the matter was discussed and agreed upon beforehand. The initiators' reasons, brief regulations, and subscription forms were written on the front page of the initiators' register, and then the initiators personally signed in order on the back. This should also be corrected. The report in your newspaper contains some discrepancies. I have been entrusted to send this letter to request corrections and ensure accuracy. Sincerely, Attorney Chen Wen.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently read the article "The Turmoil of the Great Eastern Book Company's Natural Science Textbook" in your newspaper on February 20th, which is inconsistent with the facts. I will explain each point as follows: (1) This book has been approved by the Ministry of Education, and our company has no right to arbitrarily delete or modify it. (2) "Previous versions are not allowed to be sold." Our company has not received such an order from the Ministry. (3) In December of last year, our company followed the Ministry of Education's order to revise the book to avoid disputes, and sent the revised edition to the Ministry for review. However, this revised edition has not yet been approved by the Ministry after submission. (4) Spring is the second semester, and this lesson is in Volume 7. Schools currently do not need to use this volume, so there is no intention to deceive. (5) Wired and wireless are both state-run enterprises, and there should be no discrimination. There is no malicious advertising. (6) Our company pays close attention to this matter and handles it carefully in accordance with the Ministry's orders. We are concerned that misunderstandings may arise, which may hinder our company's business. Therefore, we have sent this letter and hope that your newspaper will pay attention and publish the correction. Sincerely, Great Eastern Book Company Headquarters, February 20th.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A Reading Guidance:</p>
<h3 id="e210">A Preliminary Guide to Reading Social Sciences (I) <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>My knowledge is shallow, but I am also someone whose desire for knowledge has not disappeared. Recently, the "Reading Consultant" in the Shen Bao has given me a glimmer of hope in the darkness.</p>
<p>I read it almost every day, but unfortunately, many of the topics discussed are either different from my living environment or do not match my level. Therefore, I am still not satisfied and cannot find any guidance. I think: the guide is to show the way for those who have doubts about reading, and there is no limit to the level or class that one must reach in order to receive guidance. Therefore, I venture to use this simple language to write about my reading problems and seek advice;</p>
<p>My living environment is of course very poor, but in addition to working for a living, I also have some spare time for myself, so reading has also become a problem for me. I am probably influenced by my friends who often talk about social thought, and by seeing many bad phenomena exposed in social reality. I have developed a great interest in social sciences, so I have read some social science books in the past two or three years. However, like me, who has no foundation in social sciences and cannot read Western languages, blindly reading those profound books is like a blind person riding a blind horse. I have spent a lot of valuable time, but the benefits are still limited.</p>
<p>Some of my friends are more knowledgeable than me. Sometimes I ask them for advice or ask them to recommend books to read, but because they are influenced by the theories of various sociological schools in the current society, their views are inconsistent, and the books they recommend are also different. This only makes me more confused.</p>
<p>Recently, a friend told me: "If you want to understand the truth and future of society, economics is of course the subject you should study, but you must also have a considerable understanding of law and politics! It is best for you to understand economics clearly now, (but they didn't point out which books), and then read some books on the outlines of law and politics, and then read history and geography. It is impossible to build a very tall building in one step."</p>
<p>But how can I not know that learning is not a short-term matter! Isn't it because I am poor and cannot enjoy the privilege of that kind of aristocratic education! The day before yesterday, I went to the library and saw that there were more than a thousand books in the economics category alone. Moreover, I have to steal time from my busy schedule to read them. Even if I spend all my time on it all day long, I don't know how much I will accomplish in a year! And the other subjects of politics, law, history, and geography are outside of that.</p>
<p>Guidance, Student: What do you think I should do! I don't want to become a sociologist, I just want to know where society will go in the future. In this case, how many and what kind of books should I read? Which category should I read first? I pray that you will give me good advice so that I, a lost person in the sea of books, can find a bright path.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Agile and Accurate <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Limin</p>
<p>Success is the precious child produced by a pair of parents: agility and accuracy.</p>
<p>No matter which successful person it is, in their life, there will always be important moments of "a single hair holding a thousand pounds" and "fleeting opportunities". At such times, if the mind wavers or hesitates, or if one is at a loss, all efforts will be wasted and nothing will be achieved!</p>
<p>A person who acts quickly when facing a problem will eventually succeed, even if they occasionally make mistakes; a person who delays and procrastinates will eventually fail, even if they have better judgment.</p>
<p>If a person unfortunately becomes a victim of "hesitation", their only savior is "agile decision-making and decisive action"!</p>
<p>In addition to being agile, one must also be accurate. The most common yet sacred accuracy in social interaction is keeping appointments. If one makes an appointment with someone for a certain time and then fails to show up or is late, unless there is a truly compelling reason, it is an intentional act of deception. In the new morality, this is a deeply rooted evil trait that must be avoided. Napoleon once invited several of his generals to dinner. When the appointed time arrived, the generals had not yet arrived, so he devoured a ton of food by himself. When they arrived, he had already finished eating. He stood up, left his seat, and said to them, "Gentlemen, the time for dinner has passed. We must go to work immediately"!</p>
<p>Agility is the mother of trust. Agility best demonstrates that we handle affairs in an orderly manner and do them well, making people trust our abilities. As for those who keep time accurately, they are often able to keep their promises, which means they are reliable people.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Color <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuming</p>
<p>Red, yellow, and blue are called "primary colors". All other colors that are formed by mixing primary colors are called "secondary colors". White can reflect light and is good at radiating heat, making it suitable for summer and spring. It is called a "cool color". Black and red have the opposite function of white and are named "warm colors". The Arctic region is extremely cold, with snow and ice everywhere, so the birds and animals produced there often have white feathers. The temperate zone has a mild climate, and in the spring and summer, the grass and trees are green, so the insects that are born at that time are mostly green. This is what is called a uniquely endowed protective color. The golden powders of the Southern Dynasties and the rouge of the Northern regions are the pink color that aesthetic poets use to praise beautiful women. Buddhists say: "Form is emptiness, and emptiness is form," which inspires people not to indulge in form. Blue shirts, blue eagle movements, red terror, and white imperialism are all colors used to classify political factions. A depressed society presents a decadent and withered appearance, deeply shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere. This symbolizes the grayness of society. Those who betray filial piety advocate the doctrine of opposing "filial piety is the first of all virtues". What is there to talk about "providing for one's parents"? Small gangsters engage in petty disputes, and the next thing you know, they are saying "I'll show you what's what!". In fact, isn't the open and secret fighting between people and people, countries and countries, also a kind of "I'll show you what's what!" behavior? What doctrines liberate people and give them freedom? What doctrines loudly proclaim national equality? But the facts show us that it is just like the lives of Moroccan women imprisoned in "black cages". This bizarre society really confuses people!</p>
<h3 id="e213">Eating and Watching <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shou Ruo</p>
<p>Female employees were given the nickname "vases" by male employees, so they retaliated with the name "rice buckets". In fact, these two things are very good together, called "have something to eat and have something to look at."</p>
<p>The only gift for the working class is a pancake and fried dough stick. On the surface, it is not as exquisite as the sweets enjoyed by the bourgeoisie; but in reality, it is exceptionally fragrant and crispy, and its taste is delicious. This is the same as the saying: "A country girl has something to eat but nothing to look at." Why do flatterers only have the impression of rich people in their minds and no image of poor people in their eyes? This is probably because the poor have "nothing to eat and nothing to look at"!</p>
<h3 id="e214">Evening in My Hometown <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Zhong</p>
<p>Several days of snow have brought the cold of deep winter. It's the end of the year, just the time for farmers who have been working hard all year round to rest and recuperate.</p>
<p>In the twilight of evening, when the sun and moon alternate, night seizes the opportunity to expand its power and quickly spreads its net, covering the earth. I, a wanderer who has been away from home for many years, return to my long-departed hometown like a ghost, and wander alone on the streets I haven't been to for many years.</p>
<p>On the street, rows of wooden telephone poles stand in a straight line. The button-sized lamp heads emit starlight, flickering weakly and powerlessly in the dark sky.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, when the weather is cold, the fields no longer need a lot of labor from the farmers. They feel bored and restless at home. They sell the autumn grain, and there are still a few coins in their pockets. Although they still owe rent and have nothing to pawn, what can the price of two or three dollars per load of grain be used for? Therefore, they simply gather on the streets to eat, drink, gamble, and pursue temporary pleasure and intoxication. Especially at night, the streets of this small town in the countryside become unusually lively.</p>
<p>In the wine shop, seven or eight square tables are scattered around. White liquor, beef, and salted soybeans are served. Purple and swollen muscles, bloodshot eyes, throats like bamboo pipes, and liver-colored drunken faces create a chaotic and confusing scene with nonsense, dreams, and drunken words. Although there is no luxury of a wine hall, no pink curtains, no seductive maids, and no high-quality brandy or whiskey, madness, pleasure, and intoxication are pursued on the edge.</p>
<p>Under the thatched shed and in the broken house, bodies like firewood are curled up on a board that is a little over a foot high. Under the shadow of a bean-sized lamp, ginger-yellow and wax-like faces are faintly visible. Red pills, morphine, and opium are present. In the shadows, the giant hand of the god of death grabs the lives of everyone. Death, death, death. Scorched smoke is blown, sucked, and spat out, filling every corner and every alley.</p>
<p>"Long three, four five, yao er!" Entering, leaving, white tiger, green dragon, lying across, legs crossed, single bet, no hit, open! In the teahouse, three square tables are connected in a line, crowded with black heads and beating black hearts. Dice, bowls, dealers, and assistants beat, beat, beat. The skilled tone of calling bets, hope, doubt, and disappointment drill in and out of every gambler's heart. Status, life, and property are all staked on a single throw!</p>
<p>Therefore, the nights in this small town in the countryside are lively, warm, and thriving, like spring in winter. However, poverty, cold, and death have followed closely behind!</p>
<p>I, a wanderer who has been away from home for many years, return to my hometown like a ghost, and wander alone on the streets I haven't been to for many years.</p>

<p>In the tram, passenger A reached into his pocket and found that his wallet was missing. He quickly grabbed passenger B.</p>
<p>Passenger A: "You stole my wallet." Just then, A reached into another pocket and found his wallet there. He blushed and apologized to B, saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, please forgive me." Passenger B said coldly, "It doesn't matter. You mistook me for a pickpocket, but I mistook you for a gentleman."</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p>
<p>Drinking and Eating Extravagantly, Parting with Tears</p>
<p>Staying Up Late Warming Dreams, Singing Long Nights</p>
<p>Zi Qiang said: With such good intentions, let alone two liang of wine, even two jin of wine, I have to force myself to drink. Come, come, I'm bothering you. As he said, he held up his wine glass high, waiting for Gui Zhi to pour. Gui Zhi indeed stood by his side and filled his glass, then poured himself one as well. Then he sat down, raised his glass in salute, and slowly sipped. Gui Zhi had placed a large kerosene lamp with a shade, and Zi Qiang, sitting opposite, saw that her cheeks were red, and her upper eyelids were drooping. Even before drinking, it seemed as if she was already somewhat tipsy. He laughed: Are we really going to sit here until dawn tonight? Gui Zhi looked at him and smiled: That's what we agreed on, can I go back on my word? But you are a traveler tomorrow. If you are afraid you can't hold on, you can go back and rest. As he was speaking, a distant sound of "dang-dang qiang-qiang" reached his ears. It turned out that there were also two watchmen on this Hai Dian Main Street. That was the sound of the clapper and gong. Zi Qiang held his cup in his hand and tilted his ear to listen, saying: What time is it now? Gui Zhi raised his cup and said: Let's drink. Who cares what time it is? Zi Qiang said: You've already moved the clock in the house away, and I can't hear the gong either. When it's time to leave, I won't know. Gui Zhi opened the cabinet door, and the clock was placed inside, but the back of the clock face was facing out, while the front was facing in. He closed the cabinet and lifted a long coat on the clothes rack. A thick rope was tied to an alarm clock, hanging on the clothes hook. It was also facing out. Zi Qiang laughed: You still have the temperament of a child, so naughty. As he said, he stood up and reached out to take the alarm clock to look at. Gui Zhi reached out and blocked Zi Qiang. He laughed: When the time comes, the alarm clock will naturally tell you. What are you rushing for? Zi Qiang sat down and nodded, saying: I understand your meaning, all right, I won't look at the clock, I'll still sit down and drink. So he picked up his wine glass and drank half of it first.

<p>Fishmonger: Are you really going to buy it?</p>
<p>Customer: I am talking to this fish.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Common Knowledge of the Calendar <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>We commonly use two types of calendars, the solar and lunar calendars, to calculate years, months, and days. (1) The solar calendar, also known as the sun calendar, is compiled according to the tropical year. In other words, it is based on the apparent motion of the sun (determined by the time it takes for the sun to complete one revolution as observed from Earth). One tropical year is approximately 365.2422 days. For practical purposes, a common year is set at 365 days and a leap year at 366 days. Therefore, the fractional part of the tropical year is multiplied by four, resulting in approximately 0.9688 days. This is why there is a leap year after every three common years. However, there are still excesses and deficiencies, as it is not a perfectly precise number. Calculating it this way still leaves a very small remainder. After 400 years, there is a remainder of 3.12 days, meaning that after 100, 200, or 300 years, a leap year must be skipped to compensate. (For example, a year divisible by four in the Western calendar is a leap year, but a year divisible by 100 cannot be divided by four again, making it a common year.) (2) The months in the solar calendar are of varying lengths. Months one, three, five, seven, eight, ten, and twelve are all long months with 31 days, while months four, six, nine, and eleven are short months with 30 days. February has 28 days in a common year and 29 days in a leap year, making February a short-short month. This is due to the continuation of the incomplete calendar from the time of the ancient Roman King Numa Pompilius and does not have any particular deep meaning. (3) The lunar calendar is calculated based on the phases of the moon. There are two methods: the first focuses solely on the waxing and waning of the moon and is called the pure lunar calendar; the second takes into account the changes in climate caused by the sun's movement and is known as the lunisolar calendar. The first type is used in the Islamic calendar, and the second is used in the Chinese calendar, also known as the Greek calendar. The waxing and waning of the moon takes approximately 29.5306 days, so twelve months have approximately 354.367 days. Therefore, the lunar calendar has 354 or 355 days in a year, which is eleven days shorter than the tropical year of 365 days. This means that in less than three years, it is short by 30 days. Thus, there is a leap month every two years to adjust for the tropical year. (4) Each of the four seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter, has six solar terms. Although most people know the names of these twenty-four solar terms, many do not understand the meaning of each term. Now, I will briefly explain each solar term. Lichun (立春) signifies the beginning of spring. Yushui (雨水) signifies that ice and snow turn into rainwater. Jingzhe (驚蟄) signifies that insects hibernating underground are about to crawl onto the ground. Chunfen (春分) signifies the middle of spring when day and night are of equal length. Qingming (清明) signifies that trees and plants grow branches and leaves. Guyu (穀雨) signifies the nourishment of all grains (the above are the six solar terms of spring). Lixia (立夏) signifies the initial arrival of summer. Xiaoman (小滿) signifies that all things are gradually becoming full. Mangzhong (芒種) signifies the time for planting awned grains. Xiazhi (夏至) signifies the peak of summer, when the days are longest. Xiaoshu (小暑) signifies the beginning of hot weather. Dashu (大暑) signifies the peak of hot weather (the above are the six solar terms of summer). Liqiu (立秋) signifies the initial arrival of autumn. Chushu (處暑) signifies the retreat of hot weather. Bailu (白露) signifies the season when dew falls. Qiufen (秋分) signifies the middle of autumn, when day and night are of equal length. Hanlu (寒露) signifies that the cold is increasing daily. Shuangjiang (霜降) signifies that dew turns into frost (the above are the six solar terms of autumn). Lidong (立冬) signifies the arrival of winter. Xiaoxue (小雪) signifies that rainwater condenses into snow. Daxue (大雪) signifies that it often snows. Dongzhi (冬至) signifies the peak of winter, when the days are shortest. Xiaohan (小寒) signifies that the cold is slightly intense. Dahan (大寒) signifies that it feels very cold. (5) Jiefen (節分) refers to the day divided by the winter and spring solar terms of the lunar calendar, which is the day before Lichun. Rumei (入梅) refers to the day of entering the plum rain season, which is when the sun reaches 80 degrees of ecliptic longitude (with the vernal equinox as the starting point, evenly dividing the ecliptic into 360 degrees) six days after Mangzhong. Banxia Sheng (半夏生) refers to the time when the medicinal herb Banxia grows, which is when the sun reaches 100 degrees of ecliptic longitude. (6) The practice of assigning the seven luminaries, the sun, moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn, to the days within a week, such as the moon for Monday, Mars for Tuesday, and Mercury for Wednesday, was first created by the astrologers of Chaldea in Judea 2,300 years ago. (7) Lunar phases have been inherited for thousands of years. The shape of the moon can be used to determine the date within a month. For example, Shuo (朔) is the new moon, Wang (望) is the full moon, the 7th and 8th are the first quarter moon, and the 22nd and 23rd are the last quarter moon. (8) A solar eclipse occurs during the new moon, when the moon blocks the sun's surface, preventing sunlight from reaching the Earth. There are total eclipses, annular eclipses, and partial eclipses. A lunar eclipse occurs during the full moon because the Earth blocks the sun's surface, preventing sunlight from reaching the moon. The above is some common knowledge about the calendar. It may seem simple, but nine out of ten people in society do not understand it.</p>

<p>The Assault on Shen Huichun</p>
<h3 id="e220">Sports News: The District Court Prosecutor Files Charges <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Defendant Qin Shaoji Actually Committed the Crime of Assault</p>
<p>The Court's Criminal Division Will Hold a Hearing This Morning at 10:00 AM</p>
<h3 id="e221">The Referees Association Declines Wang Zhengting's Mediation, Expressing a Firm Stance <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shen Huichun, a famous referee in Shanghai's sports community, was invited last year to referee a football match between National Jinan University and Jiaotong University, organized by the Jiangnan Universities Sports Association. The match, held at Jiaotong University's stadium, was crucial for both schools to win the championship, leading to intense competition. Referees officiating such games face arduous work and require careful judgment, only those with high reputation can handle the task. Mr. Shen Huichun was certainly capable of handling the responsibility, as both schools trusted and hired him. Ultimately, Jiaotong University suffered a narrow defeat by one goal. Students, distraught over losing the championship, had an abrupt change of emotion. A few radical members blamed the referee for unfair decisions and confronted Mr. Shen. A student surnamed Qin, named Shaoji, even used a weapon to violently assault Mr. Shen, who fell to the ground injured and was further attacked by the crowd, suffering severe injuries. Fortunately, Dr. Rong Qizhao, president of the Jiangnan Universities Sports Association, and Ye Peichu of Jinan University, rescued Mr. Shen from the mob and rushed him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. They also submitted a medical report to the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office for assessment. Mr. Shen hired lawyer E Sen as his representative to file a criminal complaint against the student Qin Shaoji for assault. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu of the court held several hearings, and the defendant An Shaoji was released on bail as instructed. These events have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now known that after a thorough investigation by Prosecutor Tang, he deeply believes that the defendant Qin Shaoji actually committed the crimes specified in Articles 42 and 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, in accordance with Article 253, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, he has filed a public prosecution against Qin. The court's criminal division has accepted the case and scheduled a hearing for both parties this morning at 10:00 AM. The prosecutor's indictment is copied below:</p>
<h3 id="e222">Indictment by the Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Defendant Qin Shaoji, male, 23 years old, from Cixi, residing at 36 F煦 Village, F煦 Road, student.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned case of assault, number 7001 in the investigation of the Republic of China Year 22, has been fully investigated and is deemed suitable for public prosecution. The defendant's criminal facts, reasons for prosecution, and the violated articles of law are listed below:</p>
<p>▲Facts of the Crime Qin Shaoji is a student at Jiaotong University. On the afternoon of December 16th of last year, at 2:30 PM, Jiaotong University and Jinan University competed in football at the Jiaotong University stadium, and Shen Huichun was hired as the referee. When the game resulted in a one-goal defeat for Jiaotong University, Qin Shaoji, angered by the defeat, blamed Shen Huichun for unfair refereeing. At the end of the game, he gathered many unidentified individuals and together they assaulted Shen Huichun, resulting in injuries. A complaint was filed.</p>
<p>Reasons for Prosecution and Violated Articles of Law Upon investigation, it was found that Shen Huichun suffered minor injuries to both his left and right hands, as confirmed by the forensic medical report on file. The injuries to his head and other areas are also supported by the diagnosis from Tongren Hospital. Furthermore, Shen Guoquan, an eyewitness at the time, testified that he saw blood flowing from Shen Huichun's head, which is true. The defendant and many unidentified individuals jointly assaulted Shen Huichun at the end of the game. Not only did Shen Huichun clearly and repeatedly describe the events, but also Lu Xiangqian, Liang Wendong, Chen Bingde, Gao Chengju, and others present at the scene uniformly testified to this effect. It is extremely clear that Shen Huichun's injuries were inflicted by the defendant and others. Moreover, the defendant confessed, "During those few minutes, I was very unhappy because my school's training achievements for the entire semester were ruined." This shows that the defendant was angered by the defeat, and his anger led to the assault, which is undeniably proven. As for the defendant's defense, "At the time, I was standing far away from where he was beaten. I was wearing white clothes, which made me very noticeable. I did not participate in the assault. There are police officers from the sixth district who were maintaining order, as well as Wang Yongzhi, Wu Shutang, and Tu Kaiyuan, who can testify to this," the summoned police officers Meng Dazhao and Zhang Dongming both stated, "During the fight, the crowd was very crowded, and I could not clearly see if anyone wearing white clothes participated in the assault." Furthermore, Wang Yongzhi and Wu Shutang both stated, "When they became crowded, I walked away. I don't know what happened after that." Therefore, the statements of these witnesses are insufficient to prove that the defendant did not commit the assault. Considering that Shen Huichun had no prior grudges against the defendant and would not intentionally frame him, the defendant should undoubtedly be held responsible for the crime of assault. The defendant actually committed the crimes specified in Articles 42 and 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, in accordance with Article 253, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, prosecution is initiated. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu, Clerk Li Yanzhao, February 7th, Republic of China Year 23.</p>
<p>▲Attitude of the Referees Association The entire membership of the Shanghai China Sports Referees Association convened an emergency meeting last night regarding the Shen case, considering it concerns the rise and fall of China's entire sports community and the survival of sportsmanship. The unanimous conclusion was to request the court to severely punish the chief perpetrator of the assault, thoroughly investigate the accomplices, and order compensation for Shen's medical expenses and other losses. If this goal is not achieved, they will determine steps to not cooperate with the Shanghai sports community. If so, all sports events in Shanghai will be in a state of lacking referees. The school authority should take responsibility of this consequence. Furthermore, the association dispatched representatives to attend today's court hearing and requested those who witnessed the incident to testify in court. The association, while expressing gratitude for the mediation efforts of Mr. Wang Zhengting, chairman of the China National Amateur Athletic Federation, respectfully declined the mediation because the case has been formally accepted by the court.</p>

<h3 id="e225">The Qingbai Basketball Team Was Defeated by Jianhua Yesterday <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>丨Sixty-One to Forty-Seven丨</p>
<p>Tonight They Will Battle Fanwang at the John Gymnasium</p>
<p>The Qingbai Basketball Team, organized by the Hankou City Party Headquarters, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing. They made their debut last night, unfortunately being defeated by Jianhua. The final score was sixty-one to forty-seven, with twenty-nine to fifteen in the first half. Tonight, Qingbai will compete against Fanwang at the John Basketball Gymnasium in Fanwangdu. Although the hope of victory is slim, Qingbai will do their best.</p>
<p>▲The Situation of the First Battle Qingbai was still lively, and their shooting showed training, but their small size was a disadvantage. Their teamwork seemed immature and lacked agility. Jianhua's performance was not as good as usual, but they played very casually. Some of their beautiful teamwork was highly praised. In the first half, Jianhua scored six consecutive baskets, making it twelve to four. Qingbai only opened the scoring with Wang Yide. In such a contest, Qingbai was always behind by more than ten points. The first half ended twenty-nine to fifteen, a difference of fourteen points. At the beginning of the second half, Jianhua suddenly added ten points, making it thirty-nine to fifteen, the largest difference. Afterwards, Qingbai tried hard to catch up, but time did not wait, and they still lost sixty-two to forty-seven. The referee was Zhang Bide.</p>

<p>▲Qingbai's Organization After the Hankou City returned from the All-China Games as representatives of the Hubei Province, people from all walks of life and Party, government, and military leaders realized that sports were also an important undertaking and vigorously promoted it. First, the City Party Headquarters organized football and basketball teams, and various agencies then successively established sports associations and various sports teams. At the same time, military and government leaders donated prizes and initiated competitions, such as the "Roaring Forest" Football Tournament and the "Yue Jun Lin" Football Tournament, as well as the Hankou YMCA Basketball Round Robin Tournament. Therefore, City Party Committee members Wu Shaoshu and Yang Xingqin, and Shan Cheng, believed that sports were also a public endeavor and, with the determination to "not shirk responsibility," raised funds from all walks of life to organize a basketball team to travel to various places. Because basketball requires fewer people and is easier to fund, and because basketball in Hubei Province has a path and is easier to improve, they organized the Qingbai Basketball Team within two weeks, using the Evening Star Basketball Team as its base. Committee Member Wu Shaoshu led the team, departing eastward on the Jiang'an ship on the 10th. They first arrived in Nanjing, where the Nanjing Special City Party Headquarters had arranged competitions with teams from the Central Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Ministry of Railways, the National Government, and the Military Academy. The competitions began on the 13th.</p>
<p>▲Record in Nanjing In Nanjing, there were five matches: (1) Won against the Central Party Headquarters by forty-nine to thirty; (2) Won against the Nanjing Municipal Government by thirty-nine to twenty-two; (3) Won against the Ministry of Railways by eighty-seven to seventeen; (4) Won against the National Government by thirty-seven to twenty-eight; (5) Lost to the Central Military Academy by fifty-two to thirty-nine, a difference of twenty-three points. ▲Hope for the Trip to Shanghai Qingbai left Hankou and went east because the technology in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is much better than that in Hubei. Qingbai came here to learn technology. Qingbai is very satisfied with what it has gained in Beijing, and hopes to have more fruitful gains in Shanghai. Qingbai came purely to observe technology, and winning or losing does not matter.</p>

<p>Blames It on Illegal Management</p>
<p>Deeply Regrets Vines</p>
<p>▲Philadelphia, USA (Reuters) Tilden believes that the failure of the United States in the 1933 Davis Cup was entirely due to mismanagement. Tilden announced at a banquet that the American team, thousands of miles overseas, was not managed by a team leader, but directed by a domestic committee. "We must eliminate the current players and build future teams with the likes of Parker, Wood, and McGhee." "France followed this method, worked hard for six years, and finally achieved its goal, keeping the Davis Cup for six years. The Davis Cup must accept public opinion. In my opinion, Wood is the most promising amateur player today and must be used in the Davis Cup. Regarding Vines' entry into the professional world, it is a pity. If Vines were under legal management, he would have unlimited hope in the future Davis Cup. Vines is only twenty-two years old. I welcome him to join the professional world, but I am deeply saddened by his departure from the amateur world."</p>

<h3 id="e239">Hunan Elementary School Teacher Dispute: General to Implement Teacher Qualification Examination <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Zhu Jingnong, the Director of the Education Department of Hunan Province, issued an order to reorganize the qualifications of elementary school teachers, which caused a major storm in the elementary education sector of the province. Students from normal schools and those from non-normal schools formed two major factions. The non-normal school faction organized the Hunan Elementary School Teachers' Professional Maintenance Association and launched a large-scale petition, demanding that all non-normal school graduates who have been engaged in elementary education for many years and have achieved significant results should be employed. On the other hand, the normal school faction also organized the Hunan Normal School Graduates Association and launched a large-scale petition, supporting the Education Department's order to reorganize the qualifications of elementary school teachers, demanding that no one other than normal school graduates should be employed as elementary school teachers. Both sides were running around, each taking extreme positions. Director Zhu then submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for approval to formulate regulations for elementary school teacher qualification examination in Hunan Province before the central government issues relevant regulations. Those who pass the examination, even if they are not from normal schools, will be allowed to serve as elementary school teachers as a means of relief. However, due to time constraints, it was decided that the examination will be held simultaneously in eleven districts throughout the province during the summer vacation this year, with a budget of over 6,000 yuan. Therefore, prominent figures in the education sector, such as Huang Shiheng (賓步) and Cheng Caozi (谷) and others, came forward to mediate, advocating that the reorganization of elementary school teacher qualifications should be implemented after the summer vacation examination, and that elementary school teachers should not be replaced before the examination. It is not yet known whether Director Zhu of the Education Department will adopt this proposal. If it can be implemented in this way, the current turmoil in the Hunan elementary school sector can be fundamentally resolved. The examination regulations and the organizational regulations of the examination committee are recorded below.</p>

<p>The Factory Refuses to Provide Funds, and School Has Not Yet Opened</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Dispatches Personnel to the School for Investigation</p>
<p>The Anglo-American Tobacco Factory Workers' Children School in Pudong was founded by the Cigarette Industry Union of the Former Fifth District. It was reorganized last summer, with the union jointly forming a board of directors with the Education Bureau and the factory on a 3-5 system. Shen Yu was appointed as the principal of the school. In the past six months, he has revitalized the school with considerable success. Recently, the board of directors held a meeting and resolved to continue appointing Shen Yu as the principal, and also resolved to follow the Education Bureau's order to start school on time. However, because the funds owed by the factory for August and September of last year have not been released, and the funds for this semester have not been processed, the school has been unable to open. Although the school has repeatedly requested the release of funds, the factory has deliberately created difficulties and turned a deaf ear, leaving the children out of school. Now, in order to protect labor education, Chen Peide and other labor representatives on the board of directors have submitted a report to the Education and Social Bureaus requesting relief. The Municipal Government and the Education Bureau have dispatched Section Chief Feng and Tang Jingxiu to the school for investigation, and have advised the factory to fulfill the resolution of the board of directors and release funds as soon as possible so that the school can open.</p>

<p>Classes Resume Yesterday After Explanation</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Advanced Vocational School on Chezhan Branch Road in the Nanshi area suddenly experienced a student uprising and strike on the 19th of this month, and the office was sealed off. For a time, the situation was very serious. However, as of yesterday, the school has returned to normal and classes have resumed. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Situation of the Strike and Expulsion of the Principal: The Jiangxi Advanced Vocational School was founded by Li Xiehe, Zhang Dingfan, and other Jiangxi natives in Shanghai. Its purpose is to provide relief to Jiangxi youths in Shanghai who are deprived of education. Since its establishment, it has only been one semester. The position of principal is concurrently held by Xu Suzhou, a managing director. Recently, the students of the school, dissatisfied with Xu's measures, suddenly implemented a peaceful strike to expel the principal on the 19th of this month, and the situation was very serious.</p>
<p>▲ Classes Resumed Yesterday: Yesterday, a reporter from the Shanghai News specially drove to the school to inquire about the situation. According to the person in charge of the school, since Principal Xu took office, he has always prioritized the school and led by example, and there has been no misconduct. The strike and expulsion of the principal this time was actually due to the emotional reaction of a few students. Once explained, there would be no problem. Therefore, the school has returned to normal today (i.e., yesterday) and classes have resumed as usual. However, in order to prevent any further incidents, in addition to dispatching two police officers from the Public Security Bureau to temporarily protect the school, security has also been tightened compared to the past.</p>

The English student wrote a 'Record of Hunting Elephants in Africa'; the French student wrote a short poem, 'Elephant Love'; the German student wrote a 300-page essay on the subject of elephants, called 'Introduction to the Philosophy of Elephants'; and a Polish student wrote a political essay called 'The Elephant and the Polish Question'."</p>
<p>I saw this story in Yusuke Tsurumi's travelogue of Europe and America, and I couldn't help but wonder what a Chinese student would write if there were one in that school.</p>
<p>I think if it were thirty years ago, then this Chinese student would definitely write an eight-legged essay about elephants, but now it is the era of the Republic of China, and eight-legged essays have long been abolished. Even the ancient prose of Han Yu, Liu Zongyuan, Ouyang Xiu, Su Shi, and even the Tongcheng and Yanghu schools, although some people advocate restoring it, has already died. At this time, what exactly would our Chinese students write?</p>
<p>Then it is still an eight-legged essay, but in vernacular, a new style.</p>
<p>Because the education of writing naturally focuses on the carving of words and sentences, the decoration of essays, a kind of empty and contentless game of writing, and this is precisely the characteristic of Chinese eight-legged essays.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the eight-legged essay has been abolished, and classical Chinese has also been changed to vernacular, but the spirit of the old era is still deeply rooted. School education emphasizes writing, school grades are based on the quality of writing, and national examinations use essays as a standard for selection.</p>
<p>"The emperor values heroes, and writing is what he teaches you. All other professions are inferior, only studying is high," this saying is still very applicable today.</p>
<h3 id="e255">"The Traveler" and "Daughter of the Streets" <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>In the February issue of "Modern," there are two poems that I find noteworthy. One is "The Traveler" (anonymous), and the other is "Daughter of the Streets" (Su Su).</p>
<p>In recent years, good poetry has rarely appeared. Especially in lyrical poems, "romantic" works occupy the majority. Works reflecting society and modernity seem to be in the minority.</p>
<p>It is true that poetry must have a realm. But that realm must be a reflection of society.</p>
<p>In "The Traveler" and "Daughter of the Streets," there are, of course, no large harbors, noisy factories, deep underground mines, jazz-filled dance halls, skyscraper department stores, vast racetracks, and other modern scenes, but they also have profound modernity.</p>
<p>Those two poems deeply express the sorrow of a certain group of people. Naturally, that sorrow is a product of the global economic panic and the collapse of the Chinese countryside.</p>
<p>In "The Traveler," the depression and sorrow of a section of modern petty bourgeoisie are revealed. The poet imagines the "traveler treading wearily on a long journey," "carrying a basket of sorrow," watching their "hesitation" and "hesitation." Isn't this "hesitation" and "hesitation" one of the symbols of the times? For this kind of traveler, the poet instructs: "May you leave from now on, accompanying the exile of Siberia, and sing loudly." What deep sorrow is contained in this emotion of calling people to be wanderers! I think this kind of non-decadent grief is precious. The poet is forever attached to the "happy land" he "loves"! The theme of "The Traveler" has been adopted by many people, but it has never been deepened to this extent. Of course, the use of old rhetoric in this poem is a shortcoming. However, in terms of rhythm, there is no affectation. This also reflects the strong feudal nature in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Su Su's "Daughter of the Streets" is a reflection of the modern economic panic. The material is very realistic. The impoverishment of China has spread to streetwalkers. In this poem, the temporality and spatiality of the subject matter are clearly expressed. We read it again and again, and we don't see any fictional elements at all. Compared with this poem, "The Traveler" is naturally much more empty. The poet vividly expresses that the tragedy happened on the streets of Shanghai recently. The poet uses the two lines "What is annoying is the rainy season of the yellow plum season, she likes the dusk floating up in the moon" to indicate the local background on the one hand, and to express that even the prostitute has to endure the nature's anger. The prostitute "with a cigarette in the corner of her mouth and an empty wallet, walking alone on the cement road," selling coquettishness, winking, waiting for men who buy laughter, but in the end, she has to "walk home anxiously with his empty wallet." That scene is really bleak! But why are there no men buying laughter? That's what she doesn't know. She asks, "Why is this business still declining?" But she can't find a reason. However, "people are turning over like waves in the streets"! The poet links the end of the year with unemployment, and at the same time indicates that she is not the only one who is unemployed. It is "the year red lanterns are piece by piece, and her companions are groups and groups." Are they similarly unemployed? The poet not only describes that lonely prostitute, but also describes the appearance of Shanghai streets at the end of the year, and her group, and also pays attention to the ridicule of the vendors and her habit of that kind of teasing. How realistic is this! This poem has its universality, and it has its individuality. There are no embellished words in the language, and no contrived traces in the rhythm. It is a true poem. I think Su Su is indeed a new poet with a promising future. If we compare this poem with Zang Kejia's "Goddess," we can better understand the value of this poem. Zang Kejia reveals his philosophy of Stoicism through "Goddess," while Su Su is a realistic and faithful describer. I hope that more poems like "Daughter of the Streets" will be produced in the future. Who says that ordinary realistic materials cannot be written in poetry?</p>
<h3 id="e256">Feast <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>The banquet begins. The host is the director of a certain department, and the distinguished guest is the newly appointed section chief with the same status. The other seven or eight guests are all unimportant characters, subordinate to the section chief and dependent on the section chief for food and clothing.</p>
<p>This forms a scene that is not commonly seen at ordinary banquets. The host and guest sitting face to face, the director and the section chief, became the big dipper in the sky. The seven or eight section members who were doing the escorting surrounded them on both sides like stars arching the North Star. They seemed to know that they were in a position to help, without freedom of will, nor the right to speak casually, so they were all well-behaved and silent. Apart from saying "Please, please" when a dish was served, they all looked to the director and the section chief. Whenever the director or section chief said a word, some of the section members nodded, and some circled their heads in the air, indicating that this was an undeniable truth that everyone should believe. The more vigorously the director and the section chief spoke, the more vigorously the section members nodded and circled.</p>
<p>At this time, the cook just sent up a pot of stir-fried dishes. The section chief tasted it and seemed to think it tasted very good, and couldn't help but praise:</p>
<p>"This dish tastes good!"</p>
<p>The section members had all clamped a chopstick of dishes and were about to send them to their mouths. Hearing this sentence, they hurriedly nodded and circled. Several people were careless, and their noses touched the dishes, which were painfully hot, but they still echoed and praised in unison:</p>
<p>"It is indeed delicious and extraordinary!"</p>
<p>"I haven't eaten such a delicious dish for many years!"</p>
<p>The host was very happy because the dish was praised. The guest was also very happy because he actually had the opportunity to speak, and this sentence, needless to say, was also like the words of the director or the section chief, which could be included in one of the undeniable truths and had immortal value.</p>
<p>However, unfortunately! The section chief suddenly farted when everyone was silent. The sound was very loud and could not be concealed. Even the section chief himself could not help but feel a little embarrassed. The section members were not convenient to nod or circle, and what was even more hateful was that no one could help but laugh, which made everyone very embarrassed. Fortunately, one of the section members was more clever. He lowered his head and happened to see a dog drilling around under the table, so he kicked it hard. The dog was in pain and yelled "Woof" and ran out with a bone in its mouth. The director said like he was triggered: "There are many stray dogs in the city recently."</p>
<p>Of course, the section members all knew how to help, so they moved the topic to dogs one sentence at a time. Some said that a shelter should be set up for dogs. Some said that it would be better to execute them quickly, tying stones to the dogs and sinking them into the river. Some said that sinking in the river was not good, as it would easily cause an epidemic, so it would be better to use electrocution. After talking about it, even the section chief was very happy to abandon his previous shyness and joined in the conversation. And this fart became an unsolved case, and no one investigated who farted.</p>
<p>After the banquet was over, the guests were sitting and drinking tea. The host director took out a dish of golden silk jujubes from inside and said with exaggerated pride:</p>
<p>"This is a real golden silk jujube from Hong Kong, everyone is welcome, please feel free to use it."</p>
<p>Although it was said that it was free to use, the person who started first still had to let the section chief. He picked up a jujube, put it in his mouth and chewed it. It happened that this jujube had no pit, so he praised it incessantly:</p>
<p>"It's really worthy of being a golden silk jujube from Hong Kong! I think it must have been made using scientific methods, so there is no pit."</p>
<p>This made the section members a little embarrassed, because they had each eaten a jujube, but each jujube had a pit in it. Now hearing the section chief say this, they felt that the section chief's words were justified. Since the section chief said there was no pit, but they spit out the pit, weren't they deliberately opposing the section chief and ruining the section chief's platform? If the section chief was angry and ordered their dismissal, not only would their jobs be broken, but even their families would have to cry for hunger and cold. Thinking like this, they felt that this jujube pit was really a matter of great importance. Therefore, they had to frown and reluctantly swallow this small jujube pit that was as sharp as a steel needle at both ends.</p>
<p>The section chief picked up another jujube and put it in his mouth, but this time he found a pit in the jujube. He couldn't help but exclaim in surprise:</p>
<p>"Why is there a pit in this jujube?"</p>
<p>The director did not pay attention to what the section chief said before, so he said seriously at this time: "Of course jujubes have pits." The section chief still didn't quite believe it, so he asked the section members: "Did you eat a pit?"</p>
<p>The section members were even more embarrassed, they couldn't say that they ate it, nor could they say that they didn't eat it. After a long while, they all said hesitantly: "We ate it."</p>
<p>"We ate it, how come I didn't see you spitting out the pit?" Seeming very annoyed by this answer, the section chief's tone became very serious.</p>
<p>Like a thunderbolt on their heads, the section members couldn't help but look at each other in dismay, feeling that this time their jobs must not be saved. One of the section members became anxious, his throat itched, he coughed dryly, and he actually coughed out the pit. He was very happy and hurriedly took the pit out of his mouth and said: "As expected, it is a golden silk jujube from Hong Kong, even the pit is different from ordinary jujubes."</p>
<p>The other section members were even more panicked when they saw that one of the section members had coughed out the pit, so they all coughed dryly, trying to cough the pit back into their mouths.</p>
<p>The host director was very strange and couldn't help asking: "Why are you all coughing today?"</p>
<p>The section members who had not coughed out the pits were all unable to laugh or cry, and barely smiled and said: "Probably because we drank too much wine today."</p>

<p>— Shu</p>
<p>(X) (Three)</p>
<p>Xiao Shiwei discussed concubines with Mr. Qian, and said to himself, "The scenery in the south is very different from the past, and my mood is increasingly desolate. I rashly want to buy a concubine to provide a little writing," which shows that the "concubine" is a kind of tool to "provide a little writing" when the spirit feels desolate. However, Mr. Xiao was too unlucky, and the result of buying a concubine did not get any comfort. Therefore, he continued to write, "However, it is difficult to get people in a hurry, so it is inevitable to be perfunctory and have only burdens. Is it possible to get a good taste?" It is even more evident that buying a concubine is also a "responsibility" of life, and it takes a lot of effort, otherwise, "perfunctory and negligent" will only "have burdens." Buying a concubine to satisfy one's appetite, at this time, it is naturally impossible to talk about "good taste." This "writing," this "luck," this "negligence," this "good taste," can be said to be the "divine product" in interesting metaphors, not only letting us see the "concubine-marrying view" of the predecessors. Also, whether or not marrying a concubine is satisfactory depends not only on "not being willing to be negligent," but also on the results of previous lives' cultivation. Xiao Shiwei married a concubine and "failed to achieve his ambitions," so he turned to envy others. So he wrote, "I heard that Mr. Weng recently got a beautiful woman, so he is a talented person. It is because of diligent cultivation in past lives that he can obtain this beauty, so I blame myself even more for not working hard enough in my previous life." Are there people who want to marry a concubine in the next life? Why not work hard in this life?</p>

<p>— Wu Yan</p>
<p>Although it was still an inflexible accent, it turned into an urgent pleading tone. It was as if an honest and lovely child was asking an adult for candy, showing a joyful look, saying:</p>
<p>"I丨丨I want a piece of candy丨丨delicious candy."</p>
<p>And the name "Boy," which I didn't like, was also cancelled.</p>
<p>I smiled calmly and calmly, and said with a humble tone, simply:</p>
<p>"All right!"</p>
<p>Then I took him to find a good-looking girl.</p>
<p>The door and walls of the traveler's house are the doors and walls of all the families in the valley, all made of bitter bamboo pieces. The first is to take advantage of the many gaps, which are easy to ventilate and cool, and also because the slopes and mountains are full of bushes and bamboo forests, which are easy to cut and build thatched houses. I opened the bamboo fence door, and the white light of the flashlight led us in. The house originally had a large bed made of bamboo, forming a style of continuous shop, close to the bamboo fence wall. The Yi men and women were all lying on it in a mess. However, there was always a load of groceries between the two, and their bodies were stretched out in an orderly manner, and no one would squeeze anyone. They were all sleeping quietly, snoring sweetly, and none of them woke up and raised their surprised heads. Happy travelers, we two intruders are going to shatter your good dreams. Thinking of this apologetically, the pace naturally became lighter. But looking at the greedy look of this drunken European gentleman, licking his lips with a smiling face, my back was getting chills.</p>
<p>Things have come to this point, there is nothing to be done, only to start looking for beautiful women. However, whenever I encountered the heads of girls with coiled hair and wrapped in black silk scarves, I quickly moved the flashlight away, not letting this greedy gentleman see them, just saying in a half-reporting and half-disdainful tone.</p>
<p>Old Woman</p>
<p>When encountering the heads of middle-aged women wearing a foot-high black gauze scarf (Yi women are probably in the tropics, and they age in their thirties), I would stop the flashlight on their not-so-good-looking faces for a minute or two, and make him pay attention, saying:</p>

<h3 id="e259">New Standard for Margin Gold in the April Period Debuts <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>丨Public Sentiment is Strong and the Market Rises Suddenly丨</p>
<p>Heng Seng Listing Reduced on Both British and American Markets, March Period Also Rose 7.6 Yuan</p>

<p>The gold market yesterday saw the new standard for the April period on the market, the situation suddenly developed, public sentiment was also strong, and gold prices rose sharply. Heng Seng listings were reduced by .25 on both British and American markets, so the March period also rose sharply. Early this morning, the overseas silver market saw a consistent rise in the British and American markets, with the forward silver price on the Hong Kong Gold &amp; Silver Exchange rising more than falling, but large trading houses were better. Foreign exchange continued to rise, London spot gold fell 4 pence, US cotton fell 19 pounds, and US wheat fell .875. The opening price of raw materials was 932 yuan, and Shun Mao Yuan, Mao Yong and others took advantage of the low price to take positions, rising to 37-38 yuan, and public sentiment was greatly stimulated. Afterwards, although Sheng Da Heng Tai sold off, retreating to 35-36 yuan, the market conditions were stable. After the opening, banks actively bought, and large investors bought one after another, rising to over 40 yuan. Foreign telegrams reported that US silver production was excessive or that there might be a sell-off, although there was no practical substance, and Sassoon bought British, Guangbang bought American, and Qiao Zhifu also had a settlement. The domestic market was extremely tight, and the Heng Seng listings of British and American exchange rates suddenly shrank, greatly boosting public sentiment, and gold prices soared even higher. Although there were sales at high prices later, it was difficult to retreat into 40 yuan, because Guangbang suddenly came to fiercely replenish, and the morning market was supported, and the afternoon close was also stable. In the afternoon market, foreign telegrams reported that China and the US signed a silver agreement to limit silver sales. The market was afraid of fatigue and fell once, but in the end, the situation stabilized and fluctuated. The raw gold price ranged from 950 yuan to 955 yuan, which has been changed to the market average. Here's a record of the day's market conditions.</p>

And as Sheng Da Da De Cheng sold off, it retreated from 2.2 yuan to 1.2 yuan. The bank's appetite was still buying, the situation was quite stable, and it began to fluctuate.

It was found that the highest for the day was 946 yuan, the lowest was 935.5 yuan, with a difference of 10.05 yuan. As a result, it was more stable than the previous close.</p>

Heng Tai and Tong Chun slightly bought in at 6 yuan, about 100 positions in total. The morning opened at 696 yuan, up 1.3 yuan from the previous close, and then retreated to 5.5 yuan.

Only small general meetings were conducting nominal head commissions and call loan note transactions. Early market transfers amounted to over 1.2 million, with new transactions of 300,000 to 400,000. Transactions in the small general meetings amounted to 400,000 to 500,000. Banks, due to the absence of significant inflows or outflows of funds during the New Year, experienced weak receipts and payments. However, yesterday's volume was slightly higher than the previous day. Foreign banks' receipt of payment notes amounted to 700,000 to 800,000, and various miscellaneous items amounted to 1.3 to 1.4 million, with warehouse entries and exits being balanced. Chinese banks' receipt of payment notes amounted to over 1.1 million, and various miscellaneous items amounted to over 900,000. Japanese banks' receipt of various items amounted to over 800,000. Native banks and foreign firms' receipt of foreign drafts amounted to over 13 million, and receipt of foreign head commission payments amounted to over 800,000. Subsidiary currency, Jiangnan small silver dollars, fell by one yuan to 849 yuan, with 9,000 jiao transacted. Guangdong small silver dollars were at 780 yuan, a slight decrease of six yuan from the previous day, with 65,000 jiao transacted. Copper coins decreased by 1,000 cash, to 311,000 cash, with over 36,300 strings transacted, equivalent to 11,700 yuan in silver.

<h3 id="e263">Bond Market Flat and Listless Before Securities Settlement <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange slightly stabilized. However, the underlying market remained strong, suggesting a potential squeeze. Given that there were only two trading days left in the month, with only two sessions each morning, effectively leaving only one day, and the outstanding account balance remained above 30 million, a squeeze was still likely. There was no apparent reason to expect a downward trend for the time being. Yesterday's activity mainly involved short covering. The near month suddenly rose by 4.5 fen, while the forward month decreased by 0.5 fen, showing slight fluctuations. Otherwise, the market was flat and listless. Market prices were also mixed, with both highs and lows. In the second session, the No. 11 buyer purchased a large quantity of salt tax for the current month, pushing the price up by 1-2 jiao. Otherwise, the market remained flat with little movement. In terms of underlying market activity, No. 21 appeared to be covering shorts, while other activity was limited. As a result, prices were mixed, with the 20th Customs bond for the current month rising by a maximum of 5 jiao and the consolidated tax forward month falling by a maximum of 3 jiao. The 22nd Customs bond rose by 6 jiao to 1.2 yuan, but this was not a reliable indicator of price movements due to the lack of market activity in recent days. The total turnover was 10,895,000 yuan. There was no trading in spot goods. For futures, consolidated salt tax totaled 4,485,000, demobilization bonds accounted for 1,210,000, the 19th Customs Rehabilitation bonds totaled 845,000, the 20th Customs bonds totaled 1,400,000, and the short-term gold bonds totaled 2,050,000. The remaining transactions ranged from tens of thousands to over 100,000.</p>

<p>A report from New Feng Foreign Firm on the 18th stated that the New York stock market trend was uncertain, with many speculators taking a wait-and-see approach, waiting for the current uncertainties to clear. However, trading in stocks below $1,000 was relatively active. A sudden wave of selling emerged before the close, with the hardest-hit stocks falling by as much as $3. However, the market quickly corrected, resulting in only a slight overall decline. Rand Aircraft shares rose due to the company's impending contract with Russia. Big Bar Silver rose again to a new high of 4.675 due to purchases from China, India, London, and New York. The U.S. dollar was mixed, and bonds remained strong, with several industrial bonds breaking their two-year high prices. Foreign bonds were mixed. The total volume for the day was 2.35 million shares. (Wheat) Some selling occurred, and slight rain in the southwest indicated reduced supply, creating a favorable situation for buying during dips. (Cotton) Reports indicated that the area voluntarily reducing planting was approximately 13 million to 15 million, and the modified朋克海案 (朋克海案) would provide assistance. However, the bill still faced opposition, and buyers were unwilling to pay high prices. The March bulls were gradually liquidating or rolling over their positions.</p>

<p>General Marked Yarn Retailers</p>
<h3 id="e266">Still Adhering to a Selling Strategy <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>Although the yarn market fell sharply and rebounded in the afternoon, the situation remained precarious. General retailers, due to economic hardship in various regions and the difficulty in significantly expanding yarn sales, mostly adhered to a selling strategy. However, one manufacturer, believing that cotton prices were high and yarn prices were already depressed, continued to purchase marked yarn. The market rose and fell unpredictably, making it difficult to grasp.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Human Marked Yarn, Many Changes <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>In the early market for human marked yarn, prices for all months fell by 1.8 to 2.69 yuan due to the downward trend in foreign cotton and retailers selling off. In the afternoon, one manufacturer again purchased at limit prices, causing the market to fluctuate again, with prices rebounding by 1.1, 1.3, and 1.5 yuan for each month. The total turnover for the day was 36,250 bales. Sales included Da Chang (大昶) with 1,400 bales, Chang Feng (長豐) with 2,100 bales, Yuan Da (遠大) with 1,950 bales, Geng Feng (賡豐) with 1,750 bales, and Da Feng (大豐) with 900 bales.

<p>Current yarn sales were lower than yesterday. Total purchases by various gangs for the day were 520 bales, with prices falling by 5 jiao to 1 yuan. Purchase amounts by various gangs were as follows: Mainland 245, Shantou 90, Yunnan 45, Fujian 15, Guangdong 80, Peers 5, Sichuan 40.</p>

<p>The downward trend in the cotton market continued to intensify due to falling U.S. cotton prices and bull liquidations. However, one manufacturer showed some interest in buying on dips. Nevertheless, sellers continued to press down on the market, resulting in a very weak situation. However, the decline in the first two days of trading was excessively sharp.</p>

<p>In the early market for Zheng marked cotton, prices for all months fell by 5-6 jiao due to the downward trend in foreign cotton and bull liquidations. The market remained weak in the afternoon, with prices for all months falling again by 1.5-2 jiao. The total turnover for the day was 197,300 piculs. Sales included Heng Yi (恒益) with 7,300 piculs, Geng Feng (賡豐) with 15,400 piculs, Shen Chang (愼昌) with 8,200 piculs, Shen Yu (愼裕) with 3,500 piculs, Chang Feng (長豐) with 6,400 piculs, Yuan Xing Chang (源興昌) with 5,300 piculs, Chang He (長和) with 17,900 piculs, Yu Kang (裕康) with 3,500 piculs, Da Feng (大豐) with 6,200 piculs, and Sui Long Er Hang (穗隆二行) with 500 piculs.

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton weakened due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and sluggish cloth markets, leading to fewer buyers. As a result, spot prices fell by 25 points per pound, and futures fell by 14-21 points per pound. British cotton spot prices fell by 11 points, and futures fell by 12-14 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 14 points. Indian cotton was sluggish due to European exporters selling, bull liquidations, and a weak U.S. dollar. As a result, Pinggar fell by 4.5 rupees, Omra and White Broach fell by 3 rupees. Original telegram transcript (dated 19th):</p>

<p>Recent and Distant Market Sentiment Rises Together</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning, showed initial stability followed by strength. Quotes for foreign wheat were around 2-3 jiao for Chicago No. 2, and 8 fen for Canadian No. 1. Initially, sentiment for the near month was unfavorable, but then the Northern route merchants actively purchased the current month's standard, and given that spot goods from various factories could be drawn, market values seemed cheap. Short sellers also engaged in covering, so recent and distant market sentiment rose together. However, Fu Xin (福新) slightly reduced offers, and the end result was a weary appearance. Once the merchant demand stops, it is feared that the market will remain sluggish. As a result, the current month improved by a slight 2.5 li compared to the previous day, March improved by 1.125 fen, April improved by 7.5 li, May improved by 2.5 li, and June decreased by a small 5 li. There was no comparison for July.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Wheat Upward with Short Covering <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market was buoyant in both the morning and afternoon sessions due to covering demand. Sentiment was upward, and all months uniformly increased. Furthermore, there was merchant activity from the Northern gangs in the flour market, and market sentiment was very good. Although foreign wheat quotes were small, the market still rose. As a result, March was up by 5 fen, July was up by 2 fen, and February opened at 4.089 yuan, which should also be up by 3-4 fen compared to the previous market. However, it was only auctioned yesterday and was 7 fen lower than last winter. 2,000 bags of current wheat were offered, including Shandong wheat at 3.43 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 3.27 yuan, and Yaowan wheat at 3.36 yuan, all calculated according to the new market scale, which is a jiao smaller than last winter, and were split between Fu Xin (福新) and Fu Feng (阜豐).</p>

<p>Late Rice Stagnant, Down Slightly by Several Fen</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) The supply of various gangs arriving here during the New Year period has been relatively scarce, estimated at only about 20-odd locations (over 3,000 stones). Conversely, the purchasing volume from out-of-town merchants suddenly turned weak, so although both the Northern and Southern merchants continued to operate, the quantities were limited, totaling around 1,000 bags of late rice and thick japonica rice from various gangs. The late rice market seems to be softening, with Qingjiao (青角), Songsi (松泗), and Liantang (練塘) goods returning lower by 5-6 fen. As for thick japonica rice from Changbang (常帮), Sutongbang (蘇同帮), and Nangang (南港) gangs, it is being promoted by local shops, so the situation looks promising. However, because the inventory is relatively abundant in Pudong, prices are difficult to uniformly increase. Changbang and Nangang goods are tight, while Sutongbang continues to rise by 5 fen. Other varieties such as Dujian (杜尖) and various colors are unchanged.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the most shipments arrived from Changbang from various routes in Hexia, followed by other gangs, totaling over 50 locations. Sales of various colors were slightly better than before. Market prices for white japonica, Yangdu (羊杜), and Bukejian (埠客尖) were stable, thin rice and early rice prices increased by several fen, Baiyuan (白元) prices were slightly lower by nearly a jiao, and Yinyuan (陰元) was flat and listless.</p>

<p>Market Weakens and Then Rallies</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the appetite for Geng Xian rice was weak among both local and out-of-town merchants, and the situation trended towards softening. Incoming merchants were calling for a reduction of 6-7 fen. Subsequently, the Quanzhou Gang (泉州帮) suddenly became active, and the Fuzhou Gang (福州帮), seeing that market prices were fair, also resumed purchasing. The Guangzhou Gang (廣州帮), Ningbo Gang (寧波帮), and local merchants were all active, and the market rebounded from weak to bullish. It is assumed that the inventory is substantial, and shipments will arrive soon. Some owners intended to sell early, so market prices could not rise. A total of 9,232 bags were sold, with over 5,000 bags going to the Quanzhou Gang (泉州帮), around 3,000 bags to the Fuzhou Gang (福州帮), and the rest going to local merchants, the Guangzhou Gang (廣州帮), and the Ningbo Gang (寧波帮). Market sentiment was similar to the previous market.</p>

<p>Although trading in spot miscellaneous grains was within the red range, market sentiment was not good. Actual sales decreased, and sellers had to accommodate by hawking, resulting in more losses than gains in various grain markets. Yesterday, the Fuzhou Gang (福州帮) and local merchants were still active in soybeans. Factories remained in a wait-and-see position, and market prices were flat. The total volume of soybean transactions was approximately 7-8 truckloads. The Guangzhou Gang (廣州帮) was quite active in sesame, and there were inquiries from the mainland, so selling prices tightened. Around 800 bags of various sesame seeds were transacted. The Yongbo Gang (甬帮) purchased over 1,000 bags of raw peanuts, and market prices continued to weaken. The peanut market was slightly better.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Fish Market <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Fishing Vessels Dump Imports</p>
<p>Fish Market Plunges Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>In recent days, fish prices have been relatively high due to the approaching Lunar New Year (although much lower than at the same time last year). However, yesterday morning, the market plunged due to congested deliveries from various places, such as over 1,000 piculs of Ningbo fresh large and small yellow croaker and butterfly fish. In particular, the Japanese fishing vessel "Wanyi Maru" imported and dumped over 160 piculs of small yellow croaker, sea eel, etc. at reduced prices, leading to a significant drop in fish prices. For example, small yellow croaker was priced at 31 yuan per picul in the previous morning but opened at 26 yuan per picul yesterday morning. However, the final selling price was 15 yuan per picul. Other fish also experienced price declines. Therefore, the lack of a unified plan and distribution for the fish market is insufficient to stabilize it.</p>

<h3 id="e301">Re-discussing the Rent Reduction Movement <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong</p>
<p>In this "Great Shanghai," the first metropolis of the Orient, which is already deeply aware of the economic downturn, the withered market, and even laments its "decline," the land and real estate investment business is a unique and prosperous undertaking. While various businesses here are using methods such as deep discounts, buy-one-get-one-free offers, and even prize draws to attract customers to "graciously come," the sharp rise in land prices and rents cannot be compared with anything. This peculiar fact allows us to see, through the dismal scene of a large number of factory closures and store shutdowns, the construction of many large buildings, mansions, and hotels, and the construction and renovation of countless alleyways and villages. It is these towering and magnificent new buildings that have embellished and decorated a "prosperous Shanghai" during the economic crisis.</p>
<p>This "prosperity," which is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, symbolizes the deepening bankruptcy of China's rural areas, the increasing natural and man-made disasters, and the ancient country, the tail end of international capitalist powers' commodity sales and investments, is becoming increasingly colonialized. The former has resulted in many "nouveau riches" who have made a fortune and are carrying hundreds of thousands around their waists, and "local tycoons" who own thousands of acres of fertile land, bringing "Brother Copper Coin" to Shanghai as a safe haven to live as "gentlemen in retirement." Countless bankrupt farmers also come to this city with their bare hands to sell their labor; while the latter's influence has led to the decline of Chinese industry and commerce. Constant civil wars, natural disasters, and banditry have increased Shanghai's population, raising the demand for housing. The direct impact of foreign goods dumping and the decline of Chinese industry and commerce is driving capital, originally intended for production, to compete to buy land and purchase real estate. This is the source of the sharp rise in land prices and rents in Shanghai. Therefore, in the "prosperity" of Shanghai, we can see a special phenomenon that is both laughable and lamentable. The more bankrupt the Chinese countryside is, the more depressed industry and commerce are, the higher Shanghai's land prices rise and the higher the rents become. The bankruptcy of the countryside and the decline of industry and commerce have become the "heart's desire" of Shanghai's landlords and land tycoons, "the people's suffering." Therefore, many "distinguished people" are also competing to purchase real estate in Shanghai, maintaining Shanghai's "prosperity" and striving for the construction of "Greater Shanghai." One cause, one effect, can be said to have greatly attained the way of governance and chaos.</p>
<p>However, under this "prosperity," the millions of Shanghai citizens who live by selling their labor and renting houses are groaning, tossing and turning, struggling helplessly. This sound of miserable cries and wails, like mosquitoes gathering into thunder, has given rise to the recent rent reduction movement. When we think of the ugly faces of the big landlords and sub-landlords at the beginning and end of the month when they demand rent, pressing and urging payment, and the viciousness of carrying out evictions and then going to the police, it is indeed as the slogan of the Rent Reduction Movement Committee says: "Reducing rent to relieve the people's distress" is indeed a fact that "three million Shanghai citizens yearn for." And the letter from various organizations in the city to the Water and Wood Industry Union: "Blood and sweat are insufficient, resorting to pawn and sale, pawn and sale are exhausted, only to risk life." That "even if not imprisoned, one will surely turn to the gutter" directly points out the suffering of the three million citizens of Shanghai. At a time when the tide of economic crisis is sweeping the entire world, reducing rent, although not able to "revive the market and prosper Shanghai," is indeed a brave and meaningful resistance of impoverished citizens in despair against the "asset-boasting" big landlords. Because we can say that for the general citizens and laborers of Shanghai, in the torment of "making a living with difficulty," in the struggle of poverty and unemployment, the annually increasing rent is the heaviest oppression to bear, and perhaps one of the major causes of various crimes such as murder and suicide.</p>
<h3 id="e302">The Antagonistic Nature of Life <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Shuo</p>
<p>This, of course, can be said; if there are good aspects to human nature, then I think understanding and compassion are the best parts of that good.</p>
<p>If one can understand, then estrangement will not occur; and animosity will not arise between people. If, in addition to understanding, one can also sympathize, then not only will animosity not arise, but these people will be easier to win over. From there, the so-called mutual assistance in the world, as well as various good deeds of self-sacrifice, will appear in the interaction between these people.</p>
<p>Therefore, generally, whether elderly or young, knowledgeable people always believe that the inability of mankind to fully exert these good deeds of mankind is undeniably the greatest regret among us humans. This is especially deeply felt by those who have bad wives, or who have concubines in addition to their wives.</p>
<p>Originally, according to the philosophy of hedonism, life is nothing more than seeking stimulation. According to the interpretation of this school of thought, it means that one should never waste life, but enjoy every moment. Because having more enjoyment is always more fulfilling than not having it. And if one dies soon, it will be easier to close one's eyes. Thus, those who are tired of their wives, or who have become tired of them and taken concubines, always feel that "understanding" and "compassion" must be vigorously helped to develop, unafraid that "understanding" and "compassion" already permeate all the minute things in life.</p>
<p>Those who think this way do so because their wives do not allow them to associate with other women besides themselves, or to marry concubines. Therefore, their fierce resistance and fierce scolding are naturally the highest expressions of not understanding and not sympathizing. And if one can know their philosophy and not be surprised by their deep feelings, then naturally one will not be surprised.</p>
<p>But isn't that naturally so? Men earn money, and women sit and eat. So the reason why women are born beautiful is to be played with by men. But this fun and beauty only lasts for a few short years and months. After these years, of course, they are even more annoying than worn-out shoes. Therefore, while keeping her alive and providing her with some money and goods to maintain her life, one secretly or openly goes outside to find another woman to play with. Or, one takes the woman one plays with as a concubine, which is thought to be the most humane and fairest thing to do. Why can't you always be beautiful, and why don't you go and earn money?</p>
<p>However, wives are always incomprehensible, and without understanding, there is no sympathy. And since the best part of this human nature is so suppressed, destroyed, vilified, and hindered from developing by them, naturally these knowledgeable gentlemen think it is a great regret.</p>
<h3 id="e303">Her Understanding <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Xian</p>
<p>When she was very young, she worked in a factory. At that time, she was young and had little knowledge, and she couldn't see whether this huge society was "white," "red," or "black."</p>
<p>Without sadness or worry, every morning or evening she mechanically went to and from work, burying her precious childhood time into the quickly rotating machine wheel seams all day or all night.</p>
<p>She was not innocent at all, she seemed very dull, her language was also particularly slow, her face rarely showed a smile, and every movement of her hands and feet was full of a certain regularity. She seemed to have become a machine, a machine of flesh.</p>
<p>As the days went by, her age increased day by day, and she gradually loved to listen to the older sisters talking about various things between men and women during their work. It seemed that these conversations aroused her great interest, although many of them she did not fully understand due to her age, but they were all mysterious riddles that were deeply worth her thinking and guessing.</p>
<p>Her physical condition slowly began to change strangely, such as the pain of the whole body's muscles and bones, and the bulging breasts as if they were tightly bound by cloth, making her feel very painful.</p>
<p>The environment constantly gave her many irregular stimuli, and she began to flirt with the male workers. Whenever the male worker's hand touched her face or pinched her leg, the blood in her whole body would boil, and her nerves would immediately feel a special, indescribable comfort. Now she already had a "sexual" desire, yearning for "fleshly" comfort!</p>
<p>It was when she was fifteen years old, on a spring evening. The sky was full of countless brilliant silver houses, and the slightly cool spring breeze gently blew. She and a young male worker walked slowly shoulder to shoulder on a deserted road. When the young male worker's hot</p>
<h3 id="e304">Loss of Happiness <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>Through a friend's introduction, I engaged a Miss Zhu as my wife, and we have been married for several years. However, our relationship is not harmonious, leading to the loss of my happiness. I am a businessman who is often away on business. Currently, there is a third party who wishes to enter into a lifelong agreement with me. I understand this third party is already betrothed to a Mr. Zhang. Would marrying me be prohibited by law? As a merchant, I cannot afford the expenses of two households. I want to discuss a divorce with my current wife privately, without going through legal procedures, and create a divorce agreement, each keeping a copy. Afterward, I would marry the third party. I am unsure if this is legally permissible. Therefore, I take the liberty of writing to you, humbly requesting that you trouble yourself to provide a clear explanation in the newspaper. I respectfully wish you</p>
<p>Peace and Health,</p>
<p>Li Xiong森 sincerely submits</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Li's inquiry has two main points: First, can a woman who is already engaged to someone else become engaged to another person? Second, can a divorce be conducted without legal procedures, through mutual agreement? The second point is not much of a problem, as the law originally stipulated "voluntary divorce." (See "Why Does Divorce Become Difficult?" in this mailbox on February 10th.) However, voluntary divorce requires mutual consent as a prerequisite. This is what Mr. Li should pay attention to. In addition, voluntary divorce should be in writing and have the signatures of at least two witnesses. The first question is more complex because a woman who is already engaged should not become engaged to another person before the original engagement is dissolved. However, an engagement is a type of contract, and its effect is not very strong. Even if one party breaches the contract, the other party can only request compensation for damages and cannot request the court to enforce the contract. Therefore, the "third party" is not absolutely forbidden from marrying Mr. Li, but it is best to have the "third party" dissolve the original engagement with Mr. Zhang first. (There has been frequent discussion about dissolving engagements in this mailbox recently. Mr. Li and readers can refer back to those discussions. No need to repeat them here.)</p>

<p>— Yu Mei</p>
<p>With eyes that saw the relationship between men and women as an old man would, Xu San watched him smoke. A tiny, short iron skewer held a seed-like particle, which he turned over the flame, sometimes swelling, sometimes emitting a wisp of steam. Then, holding it on his left forefinger, he did this ten times, until the black particle stuck to the hole in the pipe. He pulled out the needle, burned the black particle over the flame to press it down, and then heated the smoke skewer. He poked a small hole in the pipe. At that moment, Manager Zhao seemed to remember something and suddenly leaned forward, saying to Su Ba, who was sitting on the floor mat next to Xu San,</p>
<p>"Lao Ba, have a hit. It's ready, freshly made."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't dare. No, thank you, Mr. Zhao. I've already eaten."</p>
<p>"Come on, the same, freshly made." Manager Zhao sat back down after leaning forward.</p>
<p>"Really, no, Mr. Zhao, please invite Mr. Cao."</p>
<p>Mr. Cao, after declining for a long time, took the pipe and said to Xu San, "Lao San, you..."</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Cao, please have it," Xu San quickly declined.</p>
<p>So, as Mr. Cao's lips touched the pipe, Manager Zhao's head fell back onto the pillow. The whole room was filled with lively sounds. On this small bed that was a world apart, only the sound of the paste being sucked into the pipe could be heard.</p>
<p>Because his right hand was on top, Manager Zhao smoked the second pipe.</p>
<p>Inside, at one of the gambling tables, there was a sudden moment of tension, followed by a loud noise, a "board" had passed. Soon, the tense atmosphere relaxed again, with only the sound of money. Everyone settled their accounts, and then someone loudly called out,</p>
<p>"I'm pushing a board. Fifty yuan, who's a shareholder?"</p>
<p>"I'm a shareholder." Someone quickly replied.</p>
<p>"Okay, wah, come on!" Many other voices joined in.</p>
<p>Everyone relaxed a little, some changed direction, and immediately gathered together again. Two people walked over to the tobacco area. One lay down, squeezing his tired body among the people lying haphazardly on the floor mat. One person was awakened by the newcomer, asking hazily and somewhat alarmed,</p>
<p>"What's wrong? What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"San Heshang and Wu Dachui pushed again."</p>
<p>"Okay, let's go!" The person who had just woken up suddenly sat up, felt for his shoes by the edge of the floor mat, and said, "Su Ba, how are you doing? Let's hit it once."</p>
<p>"Let's see how the wind blows, okay."</p>
<p>Su Ba went with him. The other newcomer who had left the scene sat down behind Xu San, in Su Ba's place, and Chang Fa also left.</p>
<p>Xu San, who also wanted to try his luck, remained seated on the floor mat, watching the opium lamp. He was contemplating many things in his heart. He wanted to bet on the red side five times in a row, thus winning ten yuan, and then go home and give five yuan to his wife, who would be so happy that she wouldn't even want to get out of bed the next morning. However, the money placed on the dealer might be lost all at once, so it would be safer and more reliable to share a little bit of the initial stake. His life was sustained in the lamplight and the sounds of the gambling.</p>
<p>Manager Zhao left. Zhou Chunrong, who had won the previous "board," came over. Zhou Chunrong's face was flushed, and his heart was filled with the joy of victory. He took out a yuan and handed it to Xu San, saying,</p>
<p>"Go home and get a yuan's worth of tobacco."</p>

<h3 id="e306">George Raft's Awe of Women (Part 1) <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— Mi Qi</p>
<p>As everyone knows, George Raft is a movie star who is most popular with women on the screen. Many people say his appearance is similar to the late</p>
<p>Rudolph Valentino), which is why he is even more worshipped by women. When he lived in New York and worked on the stage, his theater was packed with women every day, surrounding him so much that he had to sneak in and out through the back door. But he is a star who is most afraid of women. A Hollywood reporter recently had a conversation with him. He didn't avoid the topic and openly stated many of his opinions about women and the reasons why he is in awe of women and dare not approach them. Here are some of them.</p>
<p>He said, "I have been afraid of women since I was a child. This is not just me, many Hollywood stars are like this because there are too many women with a wild nature who always want to take advantage and extort money." These were his bold words. Some people say he shouldn't publicly say such things and insult women because how he got his star status… wasn't it mostly because women were obsessed with his looks and acting and desperately supported him? George Raft is still not married. But he doesn't live alone either, because he doesn't dare to live alone. He always has a male companion living with him. When he goes out, he always has a male companion following him like a bodyguard. In Hollywood, few people see him go out with a woman. The only one is Marjorie King. Why isn't he afraid of Marjorie? Because he is prepared to marry her. Although their wedding date hasn't been announced yet, they will eventually become husband and wife sooner or later.</p>
<p>George Raft has had too many and too surprising experiences with women in his life, which have exhausted his natural feelings for women. He said, "Now, lawsuits for breach of promise or abandonment are so popular in Hollywood that they are almost like kidnappings. No matter what star, he is likely to be framed anytime, anywhere. Not long ago, I gave a woman two thousand dollars. Actually, I can't even remember where I met her. At that time, I had just finished filming a movie and still had entanglements with the company, so although I knew that if I went to court with that woman, I would definitely win, I didn't want to fight a lawsuit with her. First, I was afraid of the publicity in the newspapers, which would damage my reputation, so I settled with her privately. But if I wasn't a movie star, I would have been unforgiving to her. But then again, if I wasn't a movie star, that woman wouldn't have had the idea of extorting money from me. They really see movie stars as 'good accounts' that are easy to be intimidated and extorted."</p>
<p>"That woman had another reason for wanting to extort money. She came to Hollywood and couldn't find a way to show her fame. She wanted her name to be published in large letters in the newspapers with mine so that she could become famous in one fell swoop. But I was smarter than her. I never told the reporters her name, and she was also afraid to announce it herself, fearing that a lawsuit would really be filed. Therefore, her plan failed except for getting a little money."

<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e307">Review of "Footlight Parade" <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Fu</p>
<p>Footlight Parade – Cathay</p>
<p>Following "42nd Street" and "Gold Diggers of 1933," Warner Brothers has this "Footlight Parade."</p>
<p>Almost every musical film is the same. A story is often secondary, and the story is just a series of songs and dances. Likewise, "Footlight Parade" is the same. Other than the song and dance scenes, it is just a mediocre story. We can almost imagine that love, conflicts between men and women, and even when we see that the female secretary and Kang De are getting along, even though he is in love with Wei Wei, he will definitely marry the female secretary in the end. There is no need to read the instructions in advance.</p>
<p>Here, the playwright is most concerned with emphasizing Kang De's artistic views. Like Wei Ya, stage people finally have to engage in stage art, and unemployed directors eventually become famous through extreme efforts. Isn't that right? When he angrily leaves the company and refuses to cooperate with Gote and others and writes his own name on the advertisement on the street, he suddenly sees a group of black children bathing and immediately sacrifices his prejudices and tries his best to save the failing success.</p>
<p>Indeed, we cannot ignore that Kang De is an unfortunate genius playwright who is unemployed. He gets funding from others to engage in his own business and also helps hundreds of unemployed dancers. If he gives up his position, wouldn't he make those dancers unemployed again? Saving oneself and helping others is the doctrine of the recovery movement. In addition, there is a song and dance scene at the end praising the Blue Eagle Movement, which is enough to prove that the main purpose of this film is to respond to President Roosevelt's recovery movement. Therefore, in addition to some tasteless love stories, we must also understand it in this way.</p>
<p>In terms of the composition of the story, it is not as serious as "42nd Street." However, in terms of the song and dance scenes, it not only surpasses "42nd Street" but is also more gorgeous and grand than "Gold Diggers of 1933." In this aspect alone, it is undoubtedly the unprecedented American musical film. United Artists' "Broadway Bad" or Paramount's "Sitting Pretty" cannot compare</p>
<p>Splendid and gorgeous, the ultimate in luxury and extravagance of American films.</p>
<p>There are four song and dance scenes in total. The first is the cat scene, which is already original and unique. The second is the Grand Hotel, which is more complex than the first. The third is the most exciting scene, with groups of women dancing in the water. Using all the skills of the camera, it shows the most advanced expression of capitalist films' exaggeration. The fourth is a scene praising the Blue Eagle Movement. After a big fight, the human body is arranged into an eagle emblem.</p>
<p>There are two points worth noting about this aspect</p>
<p>(1) The general stage plays on the screen still take into account the fixed position of the stage. Although they use the special skills of photography to make them cinematic, the whole is still restricted by the position of the stage. Such as "42nd Street" or "Gold Diggers of 1933" are all like this. But this highlights the scope of the stage and completely becomes a cinematic song and dance. Except for the first time, the remaining three times are all the time and space of the movie. Especially the third time, from the mountain to the pool, from the water to the fountain, is completely a movie method that cannot be done on the stage.</p>
<p>(2) Generally, musical films put the biggest scene at the end to leave the audience with a relaxed and happy impression. But this is not the case here. Except for the first time that appeared before the story itself, after the story is completely finished, there are three more scenes. And the most lively third scene is not placed at the end. On the contrary, like "Gold Diggers of 1933," it puts the one with meaning at the end, giving people a serious stimulus. "Gold Diggers of 1933" ends with a scene of helping the unemployed, and here it is a praise of the Blue Eagle Movement. In terms of weight, the latter may not be as good as the former, but in any case, neither will give people a very pleasant feeling. It is said that the director of "Gold Diggers of 1933" argued with the company for a long time about the placement of the scene to help the unemployed, and the result was to put it at the end. This is where the artist is unwilling to completely cater to the audience's habits. Of course, "Footlight Parade" is also the same, and it is also worth our attention.</p>
<p>In addition, there is nothing more to say. No matter how well the director Lloyd Bacon grasped the fast melody of the whole tone, and no matter how appropriately he dominated the scenes other than the song and dance, it is still that there is nothing to see except for the song and dance. Naturally, this is an unprecedented great American musical film. It is also a typical capitalist film.</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3 id="e308">Thoughts on Watching "Homecoming" <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Xin</p>
<p>When an artistic work is empty or weak in content, no matter how much the author studies in form or technique, it is ultimately difficult to tightly grasp the audience's heart and give a deep impression. The film "Homecoming" is an example. Its material is mediocre and old, and there is not enough authenticity; the intention is not in-depth; the structure is clichéd, making the house fall into a state of poverty and emptiness. However, the director can deal with such a simple story from those small details to make the audience not feel bored, which is quite a success. However, some of the performances of the set design, lighting, and actors are not sufficient, which cannot but be said to be the director's neglect.</p>
<p>The performance on the screen should of course be centered on the actors, and the setting should not only not hinder the actors' actions; performance, but also help the actors' actions and performance, just like the clouds in the painting set off the moon, the clouds not only do not hinder the moon, but also help the moon to be presented more clearly. In this regard, the screen is a bit similar to dance. If we look at the set design of "Homecoming" from this point of view, there are some shortcomings in some places. The most obvious is the living room (?) in the villa, which displays so many antiques, which are arranged there like a big archway, because the space it occupies on the screen is so large, and its fragmentedness diverts the audience's attention, making the audience's vision unable to fully concentrate on the actions of the actors in that scene; this not only does not help the actors, but also hinders them. This shortcoming is not only in "Homecoming," but also often exists in many other Chinese and foreign films.</p>
<p>Regarding lighting, we all know that its function is not only to illuminate things, but also to elicit emotions and create an atmosphere. If we use it well, it is of great help to the performance; otherwise, it will lose its effectiveness and destroy the mood of the play. For example, in "Homecoming," when Jian'er is sick, the light that her mother secretly peeks at outside is still as strong as usual, which is not in harmony with the mood of that scene. If the light is made softer, or even colder, wouldn't the atmosphere that the scene should have been created, completing a harmonious and more moving picture? (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e309">Review of "A Movie Star" <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Yi</p>
<p>The ending of the Li film is a major flaw. Since Liu Si has become aware of being played with, then she can be allowed to find a bright path. Why should she go to the old residence of her previous husband to suffer a mockery? Is this mockery what Liu Si should suffer? The creation of this unfortunate incident is not Liu Si's fault. If the environment did not force Qiu Shuang to owe debts, and if their family economy was more comfortable, Liu Si would never have fallen to this point.</p>
<p>However, exposing a capitalist who plays with women and a sycophantic class who flatters has been done quite well. Trampling on women is the nature of the bourgeoisie. He has money, and in this society where money can make the devil push the mill, let alone a weak-willed woman. With the leisure class, there is of course also the sycophantic class. Zhou Yunping in this film is an example. However, he wants to flatter, he wants to brag, which is also for money! Therefore, people like He Gongzhe are hateful; people like Zhou Yunping are pitiful.</p>
<p>He Gongzhe's wife's appearance is unnecessary. She is also written too unreasonably. She sees her husband bring a woman to live with him, and she not only does not object, but also uses her like a servant, even a lamb will make a few calls when it is in pain, let alone a person</p>
<p>Now we want to mention Hu Shan's sensual scene, which is the so-called "sacrificing appearance." I really don't understand why the producers don't offer the audience the complete content, but use women's bodies to attract the audience? Or it can be said: this is also for "money"! I am silent, I am speechless.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3 id="e310">Queen Christina (10) (1) <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Chen</p>
<p>After a pause, Magnus changed the subject and said, "Your Majesty looks radiant today, a beauty never seen before." Christina said, "Magnus, I thank you for all the compliments on my appearance because you are an expert at dealing with women." Magnus said, "Your Majesty's favor is truly grand, but this grand favor has not warmed my heart. What you have given me is just a few crumbs, and the whole has indeed been reserved for others." Christina's pace moved. She said to Magnus impatiently, "Magnus, what exactly are you trying to get to the bottom of?" Suddenly, Magnus hugged her tightly. Christina struggled desperately and pushed him away, but his lips had already brushed against her fair neck. They then stared at each other warily, with hatred in their hearts. After a while, she walked away quickly.</p>
<p>That day, a grand banquet was held in the palace to welcome the newly appointed Spanish ambassador. Senior military officers wore full dress uniforms, cabinet ministers wore grand dress, and noble ladies were all dressed up in colorful clothes and jewels. Queen Christina arrived, and the orchestra played intricate music. She sat upright on the throne, with a prototype of the Swedish crown attached above the throne. Her heart was pounding because in just a moment, the young Spanish envoy was about to appear before her. After a while, the master of ceremonies loudly recited the Spanish envoy's full name and official title. The huge palace doors opened, and the orchestra played the Spanish national anthem again. Ambassador Antonio walked quickly into the great hall under the salute of the royal guard, followed by a group of subordinates and attendants dressed in extremely fancy clothes. When he approached the throne, Christina's breathing became short, but she could still imagine how shocked he should be, happy shock. The ambassador walked forward, and in front of him was just a colorful brilliance. The queen sitting at the end of the throne also seemed like a golden sacred being, and he dared not look at her directly, so he walked closer, glanced at her slightly, and knelt down on one knee, with his head bowed to show obedience and respect. Unexpectedly, the queen on the throne opened her mouth. She said, "It is a great honor to welcome your Excellency to our court today."</p>
<p>Antonio felt that the voice was very familiar, and quickly raised his head. Only then did he see that the queen sitting above was the queen he had met on the road the other day. He panicked for a moment, not knowing what to do. He also remembered, just kneeling with his knees bent, looking at her reproachfully. After a while, the queen continued, "Please convey my gratitude to your king, for being able to send someone like you to our country, it is truly a supreme honor." Magnus, the minister of finance standing next to him, looked at the ambassador and the queen, from the queen to the ambassador. Prime Minister Oxenstierna coughed deliberately, and Antonio suddenly felt that he had lost his manners and immediately stood up. Although he tried his best to calm down, he already felt flustered and didn't know what to say. (To be continued)</p>
