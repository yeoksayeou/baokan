<h3 id="c33">德國政變内幕管窺 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>德國行將政變之說。傳之己有旬日不謂政變尚未發動。希脫拉卽以迅雷不及掩耳之手腕。而加以撲滅。其手腕之敏捷。頗爲世人所稱道。然希氏所撲滅者。究爲敵人。抑爲本黨之信徒。則不能令人無疑。蓋事前爲人所預料者。卽此一政變之主力。當爲國防軍。而事實上爲希氏所懲處者。竟爲希氏一手造成之挺進隊。且據德電觀之。希氏於逮捕挺進隊各領袖之時。國防軍亦同時出動。從旁恊助。可疑之點一也。向以右傾著名之國防軍。旣爲希氏之助。則前曾一度爲國防軍領袖之史萊轍。似不應爲希氏所殺。而事實證明。乃竟不然。此其可疑之點二也。副總理巴本者。乃一有名之復辟派。亦興登堡之親信。設今次希氏之行動。爲右派所嗾使。則監視巴本之舉。似甚無謂。此可疑之點三也。更據德國官塲之宣稱。則除希氏震怒於其信徒之穢德醜行與奢侈生活外。亦殊不能明瞭希氏此舉之目的。實則自希氏上辜後。其徒衆之得爲大工商業之掛名委員。而坐享厚薪者。早己不可勝數。何以希氏一向優容。而突於今日始嚴其紀律耶。此可疑之點四也。有此四疑。吾人乃不知希氏此次驚人行爲之動機。果在爲右派剷鋤左派耶。抑爲左派壓抑右派耶。又眞爲肅淸黨内之腐化分子耶。於此眞相尚未全明之頃。吾人未便有確切之判斷。唯就國社黨得勢後之經過觀察。希氏今次之行動。似爲右翼逐漸抬頭之象徵。</p>
<p>國社黨歷次勝利。皆受中産階級小商人與小農人之援助。故方共起也。論者皆謂中産階級之抬頭。然證以一年半來之事實。小商人與小農人並未受希黨黨綱所許之特惠。蓋小商人所企望者。卽在希黨實行其封閉百貨商店扶植零售商人之政策。而小農貧農所企望者。則爲没收大地産與廢除重利制。詎知希黨竟口惠而實不至。至其所以爽約之原因。則因國社黨上臺之前。巳受金融界大實業界之資助。上臺後。一般金融實業機關。百貨商店及規模宏大之合作社。皆相繼聘任國社黨員爲委員。予以監察性質之職位。薪資極爲優厚。猶太人之商店。且全然爲國社黨員所經理。故其利害。不獨與大資本家無所衝突。抑且水乳交融。欲其仍守執政前之諾言。自屬難能。大地産之未能没收。農民放欵利息之未能减低。癥結亦類於是。</p>
<p>然此種生活變遷。猶限於國社黨之中層分子。而上層分子之變遷則尤大。希脫拉與大金融家沙赫德Ｓｃｈａｃｈｔ大鋼鐵業家鐵森Ｔｈｙｓｓｅｎ之關係。其最著者也。希脫拉於一九三二年中之數次競選。其競選運動費。多出自此二人。此希氏所以右傾之原因一也。希氏之右臂戈林。最近己與德國鋼鐵大王鐵森之女締婚。與實業家之關係。更形密切。戈林之右傾。本爲國社黨各領袖冠。今希氏芟除反側。戈林舉足輕重。效力獨多。此希氏所以右傾之原因二也。</p>
<p>總觀希年來之所爲。與其今次之行動。似己右傾於大資本家之懷抱。彼恐左翼發難。故以先發制人之手段。大肆屠殺。以重樹將墮之威信。而使徒衆爲盲目之追隨。唯國社黨員。經過此番刺戟。對於希氏能否永矢忠誠。則尚有待於是實之證明。而國社黨員腐化生活之暴露。給予人民以甚惡之印象。能否依然留戀於國社黨之主義。恐亦尚在未定之天也。</p>

<p>（東京）繼任内閣者究竟何人此乃全國人民注目之目標、綜合各方面之情報、宇垣總督因軍部之反對甚强硬、其實現似係困難、一木樞府議長之組閣說不能信、因一木就任樞府議長有重大理由、重臣方面不願輕易更動其職、至於淸浦内閣說、因其年齡過大、且軍部方面之關係、不如往年之密接、世上雖有種種風說、其繼任說似不能實現、由此觀之、齋藤實再組閣之見解、可謂最有力、第二次齋藤内閣將以改造方針組織、政黨方面亦支持其前途、亦未可知、（三日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）西園寺公對於繼任内閣之首領人選、究將奏請若何人物、各方面非常注意、但西園寺與牧野内府均似主張爲收拾時局起見、不宜擇其無理之道、在四日進宫之先、聞擬再與牧野内府及其他重臣討論成熟之後、再行奉答日皇、蓋由西園寺公卽日遄返御殿塲及其環境之情形觀之、結局仍將奏請大命再降於齋藤、以爲迅速解决政局之計、此說更覺有力、聞齋藤首相倘於再次組閣之際、爲欲使人心煥然一新起見、或須决計將現内閣大加改造也云、（三日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）齋藤二次内閣說有力之時際、今忽有山本内閣說出現、其勢不可輕視、齋藤内閣辭職之原因、不僅在於大藏省事件、對於奏請日皇任命某閣員之事、負政治的責任而辭職、故由責任政治之立塲觀察、組閣大命决不致降下於齋藤、據政界有力者之意見、推舉現内相山本達雄爲繼任内閣之首領、最爲適當、山本雖有民政黨籍、然其黨色頗淡薄、其資格比鈴木·若槻兩人更老、於是山本内閣說俄然有力化矣、（三日日聯電）</p>

<p>一、原文稱查正太鐵路原借法欵四千萬佛郎、期限三十年、按期付還本息、巳於民國二十一年三月一日如數淸償、理應根據合同解除契約、收回自辦、乃顧孟餘延不接收、竟秘密與法代表瑪爾丹繼續進行材料借欵、（即由法方代購材料、作爲現欵結帳、分期償還、後半年爲一期、十期攤還）迨瑪爾丹回法、與巴黎電機廠商訂材料借欵、總額九千萬佛郎、作爲展修大潼路之用、分爲三批過付、計五千萬佛郎爲一批、二千五百萬佛郎爲一批、一千五百萬佛郎爲一批、每批各立合同一份、遂於民國二十二年七月一日、由顧孟餘派代表與巴黎電機廠代表簽定成立、致使正太鐵路、遲至一年之久、始爲形式上之收回、又恐外人指摘、乃將材料借欵合同、僞稱爲購料合同、（聞該項材料、巳到數批、由隴海路西段及大潼路分用、）查此項材料借欵、除以甫經接收之正太鐵路收入作抵外、又以中國交通等華商銀行團爲擔保、此外並續任法人維諾爲正太路車務處長、改任法人薄言爲正太路總稽核、兼大潼路總工程司、而中交等銀行團、因債務關係、亦派石家莊交通銀行行長汪貽曾爲駐路監察員、是正太路名爲接收、大權仍操諸法人之手、而所有全部收入、作爲無限制擔保、條件尤爲苛酷、此該部長對於借用外欵不顧利害、喪失國權之所爲、應付懲戒者一、除原文中與事實不符各點、巳經監察委員楊天驥等審查糾正外、所稱「理應根據合同、解除契約、收回自辦、乃顧孟餘延不接收」「致使正太鐵路延至一年之久、始爲形式上之收回、」此種昧於事實、妄加臆測之言、乃出於監察委員之彈章、誠屬不幸、查本部根據一九○二年十月十五日（即前淸光緒二十八年九月十四、）與華俄道勝銀行締結之正太鐵路借欵合同第五欵、擬於民國二十一年三月一日還淸借欵之日、舉行接收正太鐵路、但法國巴黎銀公司、（該路債權後由華俄道勝銀行護與法國銀公司）代表及法使館先後提出異議、其所持理由、（一）謂所訂行車合同第五欵第一節、訂明自簽押之日起、以三十年爲期、最早須於民國二十一年十月十五日方能交還、（二謂自歐戰後、中國政府償還一九○二年五釐金借欵、均用紙佛郎、核與借欵行車合同規定不符、根據借票所載條文、要求以金佛郎償付、而我國祇付紙佛郎、該項五釐借欵事宜、至二十一年三月一日尚未終結等語、聲明不肯將該路移交、先後交涉多次、仍無效果、適於是時　有上海一二八事變發生、外交緊急、此事關係時局、措施尤須審慎、不得巳遂稍緩進行、乃改於十月中强行收接、惟至今法方尚未承認、至接收之情形、亦非如該監察委員所稱、祇爲「形式上之收回」、「正太爲名爲接收、大權仍操諸法人之手」、我國新式事業、雇用外籍人員、不但前例甚多、亦且有利而無害、查正太路自創辦迄今三十年、規模嚴整、管理完善、收入無缺、用度節省、因此借欵本利、皆巳按期償淸、路譽旣佳、路信亦隆、以二百餘公里之窄軌鐵路、竟有如此成績、稱爲中國鐵路之模範、泃無愧色、然推其致此之故、則大半不得不歸功於服務該路之法國人員、不但彼等在路成績優良、接收之後自以續任爲宜、藉收駕輕就熟之效、即念其前勞足錄、表示中華民國對於盡忠職守之客卿、優予奬勵起見、亦不宜於收回之日、全數罷免、此本部於接收正太路後留用一部份原有法籍人員之理由也、至謂「大權仍操諸法人之手」、更不知其何所據而云然、該法籍人員、皆係鐵道部所任用、人有專職、職有專司、受部章之約束、聽局長之指揮、每逢歲終、由部按其成績分則奬懲、此而猶謂「大權操諸法人之手」、</p>
<p>則依該監察委員之意、非將中央地方各機關一切外籍人員一律辭退不可矣、原文又謂「而所有全部之收入、作爲無限制擔保條件、尤爲苛酷」、查購料合同總値五千萬佛郎、合國幣一千萬元、而正太鐵路每年盈餘不到二百萬元、尚須扣除他種支付、凈餘實不過一百餘萬元、如不以全部作擔保、依該監察委員之意、應以若干部份作擔保乎、以一百餘萬元之收入爲一千萬元作擔保爲「苛酷」、依該監察委員之意、如何條件始爲不苛酷乎、此極願該監察委員有以明敎而代籌者也、</p>
<p>二、原文稱此項材料借欵數達九千萬佛郎、旣以展修大潼路爲名、又復明知不經濟之工事用欵、與夫損害國權之苛酷條件、斷不能取得中政會議及立法機關之同意、於是表面上稱之爲購料借欵、分批訂約攤少額數、希冀朦混國人耳目、以圖避免呈請中政會議核准交立法院依法審核之法定手續、此該部長違反國法、對於中政會議及立法機關職權之行使、巧爲趨避之所爲、應付懲戒者二、購料與借欵不同、該合同係購料合同、不能强稱爲借欵合同、此層於答辯監察委員楊天驥等審查報告中己言之、茲不復贅、</p>
<p>三、原文稱所謂大潼綫者、興工至今、將届一年、僅目榆次起、循同成舊綫至太谷間三十五公里、原有土工、　行修復　軌亦只有五六里之短、（軌間爲四英尺八寸半、比較正太路軌間一公尺、寛狹不同而山西兵工興築之同蒲路、亦自太原起經榆次太谷至介休止、是太原至榆次間之正太路、與榆次至太谷間之大潼路、遙遙相望、均成爲最近距離之平行綫、際此國營鐵路亟待擴充之秋、關於國内重要交通、急宜興築者何止此路、該部長借用鉅額外資、乃獨爲此平行路綫之修築、先其所緩、重其所輕、罔識大體、措置乖方、且目前工事期間、旣以玩愒時日、糜耗薪給、他日該路綫縱幸而修築完成、又將以兩平行綫路之故、啟營業上之競爭、結果必致兩歸失敗、此該部長措施失當、故意損害國家利益之所爲、應付懲戒者三、查此次所購材料、大都用之於潼西綫、並非用之是於大潼綫、監察委員楊天驥等之審查報告亦己言明、茲不復贅、惟所稱部修之大潼綫與山西省兵工築路之同蒲綫、均成爲平行綫一節、其經過情形、不得不略爲聲明自山西大同至蒲州之同蒲綫、即以後部稱自大同至潼關之大潼綫、爲貫山西南北之幹綫、南接隴海、北入平綏、亦爲全國鐵路網中南北行之主要幹綫、依鐵道部之意、應築標凖軌道、俾與全國各幹綫相通、而爲全國路網之一部、本部於二十二年春間因借欵有望、爲促早成功起見、遂於二十二年二月組織大潼路工程處、開始興工、並令正太路局員兼辦、直隷該局、以節費用、乃不久山西省當局亦動工興築窄軌之同蒲鐵路、該項計劃、事前並未經鐵道部核准、惟閻主任於大潼路方始興工之時、有電致余、略述輕便鐵路之計議、並商請飭令各路免費輸運材料、余當於三月十五日復閻主任删電如下、「太原閻主任百川先生動鑒、元電敬悉、晋省築路問題、前奉江電後、一面專候詳函以憑研究、一面將此辦法面告李廳長託其轉陳、諒邀淸聽、大同至潼關之大潼路、現部中業巳積極進行、不日動工、如尊處興築輕便鐵路、當在該路範圍之外、至輕便鐵路應用之洋灰免收運費、巳飭路局照辦矣、弟顧孟餘删」、其後閻主任派崔文徵先生到京、向孟餘詳述晋省兵工築路計劃、因於四月三日、再致閻主任江電如下、太原閻主任百川先生動鑒、據崔文徵先生面述尊處兵工築路計劃、將先築由榆次南行之綫、查此綫適與大潼鐵路平行、將來運輸營業、勢必互相競爭、實於兩路有損無益、鄙意尊處修築輕便鐵路、宜注重國有幹路之營養綫、大潼路旣爲南北之綫、則輕便鐵路宜爲東西之綫、如自平遙向西之綫、自靈石横亘東西之綫、及自淸化鎭向西入晋南之綫、如能陸續興築、實可與國有幹綫分工合作、相助相成、鄙見如是、容有可以採納之處、尚祈卓裁爲幸、弟顧孟餘江、上項意見、閻主任未能照辦、旋部中於五月接大潼路工程處呈報稱（一）閻主任巳於四月十三日開始建築幾與大潼綫平行之榆次徐溝綫路基（二、大潼路工程處所需用以作辦公及供員司住宿之房屋、現爲建築上述路基之軍隊所佔用、其後天潼路工程處進行困難、日益增多、經歷次磋商之結果、閻主任僅允將來標凖軌之大潼路完成以後、再將窄軌之同蒲路拆廢、但聲明在部辦之大潼路未完成以前、省辦之同蒲路仍照舊進行、本部見技術上經濟上及其他種種困難、無法解决、遂令大潼工程處暫時停工、而原爲該路所訂購之材料、乃悉移用於他綫、以上爲大潼綫築而復止之經過、該監察委員劉侯武、不察事情、妄肆評訐、誠彼自稱「罔識大體、措置乖方」者也、</p>
<p>四、該監察委員稱「論者謂此次購料黑幕多端、其漁利之精巧、中飽之數目、有甚於前此北京政府時代之借欵回扣者、人言嘖嘖、不爲無因」、該委員劉侯武不但昏　糊塗、不察事實、且又造此毫無根據之讕言、全以毁壞他人名譽爲事、但使國家有常法、社會有良俗、此種讕言、一出諸私人之口、巳構成毁謗之罪、今以監察院之尊嚴、其行使職權、提出彈章、公開發表者、乃爲文明國家法律之所戒、風俗之所不許、誠不禁爲吾國監察制度之前途悲矣、（完）</p>

<p>鑛産以煤爲最多、而他項鑛産均未試探、其在阿額兩蒙旗境、聞五金皆有、究因缺乏專門人才之指導、及資本家之企業、遂致貨棄於地、無法開掘、鹽鹻係天然結晶、産量甚豐、花馬池·惠安池·狗池·爛泥池·蓮花池·等、每年結晶成鹽一次、其在、</p>

<h3 id="c197">主觀的眞理與客觀的眞理丨答梅棠君丨 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>就字義上說來，主觀的眞理是指那僅只能存在於人類的頭腦中而不存在於外界事物中的眞理，反之，客觀的眞理則是存在於客觀世界（即外界事物）中而不能存在於人類的思想中的眞理。因此，講到主觀的眞理時，無異說··「我以爲怎樣就算是怎樣」，而客觀的眞理則是說··「我不能參加意見，只看事實如何而定。」</p>
<p>但是，就事實上說，這樣的眞理是不能成立的。「我以爲怎樣就怎樣」，你也以爲怎樣就怎樣，那麽人人可以指鹿爲馬，這怎能算做眞理呢？眞理必須與虚假有分别，如果各人都依自己爲標凖，誰是眞誰是假就無從分辨，這種主觀的眞理是不成其爲眞理的。客觀的眞理也是一樣，如果客觀的眞理僅僅是存在於外界事物中而不存在於人類的思想主觀裏，則人類思想與客觀眞理之間就無從發生關係，客觀眞理便不會被人類所認識，人類旣認識不到他，又怎能知道它是眞理呢？</p>
<p>所以，主觀眞理與客觀眞理雖然是兩種對立的東西，但如果照死的字義上的解釋，將兩種東西截然地分開來看，則結果兩種東西都將不能成立。要怎樣才能使兩者都成立呢？那就要把握着這對立物的統一。</p>
<p>怎樣地把握主觀與客觀的對立的統一呢？在解釋之先，先舉一個舊故事作例··某處掛着一塊盾牌，有兩個人來評判，一個人站在盾的面正，看見是金色，主張盾是金色的，一個人站在盾的背面，看見是紅色，就主張盾是紅的。於是兩人爭執起來，吵做一團。其實盾的顏色本是兩面不同的，兩人各看見一面，而不看見另一面，如果都看見兩面，便不會爭吵了。</p>
<p>這裏所說的兩個人，都抱着一種主觀的眞理。這一種主觀的眞理，並不是前面說過的純粹由任意的妄想所造成的主觀意見，而是因爲觀察不完全，使人口會同持着事物的一面，以致形成的片面的眞理。這種眞理雖然不完全，但它究意能抓着客觀事物的一面，所以還可以算是眞理，同時這種眞理只是觀察者的主觀所見的一面，而不能代表眞正的客觀的事物，所以它始終是主觀的眞理。要等到盾的兩面都觀察到了，將兩人的意見綜合起來，就可以成爲客觀的眞理。</p>
<p>因此，主觀的眞理是客觀的眞理之一面，是不完全的客觀眞理。當我們找到了客觀的眞理時，到那時我們儘可以將主觀的眞理推翻，但是，我們並不能因此就完全拒絶了主觀眞理的價値。因爲外界的事物是多方面的，我們的認識能力决不能馬上便把事物的各方面立刻把握着，我們的認識事物，是一方面一方面的漸漸地深入進去，我們的知識是漸漸地增加的。要達到客觀的眞理，必須先經過主觀眞理的過程，先由片面的，不完全的知識開始，而漸漸達到完全的領域。這就是說··「在任何主觀的眞理中，都必然會有着客觀眞理的萌茅，主觀眞理的增加，即是這萌茅的成長，成長到一定限度時，萌茅便成爲眞眞的客觀眞理。這就是所謂過程的發展。不了解這種道理的人，以爲主觀眞理與客觀眞理是絶對分離而不能互相轉化，這種將事物分離了的看法，就是所謂形而上學的看法。其不合理，是前面最初便說過的了。</p>
<p>還有一點要注意的是··外界的事物的各方面的性質，决不一定會像盾一樣地可以擺在那兒給我們看見的。水是流體，是透明的，這些固然可以一看便知，但温度到了一百度便會沸騰的這一點性質，却不是一看便知的了，要知道它會沸騰，必須拿在火上燒一燒。一切事物的性質，只要是稍稍深刻一點的，都必須要經過人們的一番加工改造，才能够顯現出來，這就是說，人要知道事物的性質，必須要在事物中去實踐，實踐愈多，則對於事物所知道的愈深，每一種實踐爲我們提供事物的一方面的眞理，各種實踐的眞理之總合，便可以組成完全的客觀的眞理。</p>
<p>我們不可忽視主觀的眞理，但是，也决不可誇大了主觀的眞理，主觀的眞理中有客觀眞理的萌芽，所以不能忽視，然而它只是萌芽，所以也不可以誇大。我們要不斷地實踐不斷地改造事物，以增進我們的認識。觀念論哲學的特徵之一就是使我們脫了實踐，將我們關閉在觀念的主觀的象牙塔中，而不能向着事物的内部性質一層一層地深造，所以我們要反對觀念論。（完）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>在各項海貨之中，常用的有魚翅，魚　，魚肚，燕窩，海參等等它們的種種製法，都和宫外各處大致相同，可以無需贅述。</p>
<p>大凡每一種海菜的價値，總要比尋常的牛羊鷄鴨貴上幾分，想必是取得比較不易的緣故。但是論他們眞正的滋味，却實在不敢恭維。便是太后，對於各種海菜，也都看得很平淡；尤其不歡喜那海參。海參本是一種淡而無味東西，它的形狀更是醜惡不堪，但一般人都說它有滋補的功用，因此也得濫竽在那些眞正的美味裏頭。</p>
<p>太后還有一樣特别愛好的菜，那便是淸墩鴨舌。這鴨舌就和鴨子的肉放在一起墩的，每次至少要有二三十條，浮起在湯的上面。因爲這是太后所最中意的一樣菜，所以每次總是裝在一個特備的杏黄色的大碗裏的，而且總是安得最近太后。此外還有一種鹽水製的鴨掌，爲每次「小吃」的時候所必備的一件特菜；但是這東西却只有一重蹼皮尚可供人咀嚼咀嚼，旁的就全剩骨頭了。鴨肫肝，鴨臓等，也往往用種種不同的方法調製起來，供太后佐膳。從這幾點上看來，太后對於鴨子，眞可說是特别的鍾情，除却那一塊有奇臭的鴨屁股之外，伊簡直不肯輕易放過的。</p>
<p>到了夏天，各種瓜菓都上市了，御膳房裏的廚夫，便得利用它們來做幾種時鮮的特菜，供上去孝敬太后。其中有一種爲太后所最欣賞的，那是「西瓜　」。它的製法是把西瓜中的瓜瓢一起挖去，而把切就的鷄丁，火腿丁，新鮮蓮子，龍眼，胡桃，松子，杏仁等等，裝進去，重復蓋好，隔着水用文火來燉，燉上了幾個鐘頭就行了，其味之淸醇鮮美，我們不難想像得之！（七四）</p>

<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>在中國，别的事情誇不起嘴，惟有一百三十六張的麻雀牌，居然能够遠渡東灜，盛行歐美，未始不是一件榮譽的事情？本來，麻雀牌是中國的國粹，中國四萬五千萬的男女同胞中，至少也有三萬萬人可以上塲的。我常說··一個個都說中國敎育太不普及，所以不識字的。竟佔百分之八九十，其實這句話的確是錯誤的，你說他們不識字，他們怎會認得麻雀牌上的東，南，西，北，中，發龍，鳳，和一，二，三，四，五，六，七，八，九萬呢？</p>
<p>黨國要人中，也有很多酷嗜此道的，而且他們的竹戰技術，也有很精巧的。尤其是曾經威鎭兩湖的某將軍他的雀戰技術，在黨國要人中，堪稱首屈一指！　　麻雀牌除掉賭博以外，似乎没有别的用處，但是ＸＸ部的解釋，則麻雀牌的本身，並不能算是違禁物，而可以通運無阻。這種奇妙的解釋，眞是惟有天曉得，我們小百姓，實在是莫測高深，不敢猜度了！我有個朋友，能够閉着眼睛看麻雀，只須用兩個指頭一摸，宛如看見的一樣。而且可以自治至終將十三張牌倒着看，這的確可以說是麻雀大王啊！</p>

<p>杭育！杭育····一羣赤膊的苦力，在扛着剛纔從某處運來的貨物到堆棧裏去，不停地，來了又去，去了又來，他們身上的汗珠，像潮水般湧出來，嘴裏不停的在怒吼着，怪凄慘的音調，爲了生活，他們不得不去這樣的努力工作。吳淞江裏的水，烏黑的顏色，歇斯的里地在激盪着，受到了熱烈的日光蒸發，經了微風的吹動，一股很腥臭的氣味，便迅速地向每個人的鼻孔裏鑽進去，怪難聞的······。</p>
<p>三二個江北小孩，裸着兩條瘦得可怕的腿，赤了膊，在河灘邊的汚呢裏，東去挖一挖，西去鈀一鈀，希望能够得到一些無代價的東西，一會兒，一個孩子拾到了一隻破碗，一個孩子拾到了一隻銀角子，拾到銀角子的小孩便含着勝利的微笑，繼續去挖掘，拾到了破碗的一個孩子，哭喪着臉，可是他仍舊在努力他的工作，希望拾得比銀角子更貴重的東西，人的心是最凶狠，尤其是窮人的心。</p>
<p>搖船的船夫，拚命地在用力握住着那枝長櫓，左一拐右一拐在搖着，嘴裏在唱各種俚俗淫佚的山歌，一面在笑着，他們所唱的歌聲，没有伏爾加船夫曲的勇壯，悲哀。滿天的晚霞，呈現在漫無邊涯的雲霄裏，有紅的，有黄的，多麽的鮮艷美麗，可是不久呀，你就得受黑魔的侵襲，而消滅你的軀體。吳淞江裏的水，歇斯的里地在激盪着。</p>

<p>— 馮摩民</p>
<p>昨天我路上經過一家門首，孝幃白幔，無欵地一定是死了人了，可是孝幃裏祗有一個中年婦人在哭，其餘都鬨在門首，而且都揑着鼻子搖頭，也許是天氣炎熱，死屍發臭，也是極平常的事，不道旁人都在議論紛紜，說是這個人掉在屎坑裏死的，所以臭氣四溢，雖己洗滌過了，但穢氣未凈。</p>
<p>據說··此人生前極好，而且極忠厚，從江北搬到江南來，有十幾年，從來不曾和人家吵嘴的所以附近鄰居，都稱頌他的，一天，忽然一夜未歸，還想他在朋友家裏應酬，不料巷口犀坑裏發現一個死人，羣相往觀，原來就是中年婦人的丈夫，於是悲從中來。</p>
<p>遺臭萬年和流芳百世二句話，一句是咒詛人家，一句是恭維人家，如果是大奸刁巨猾，無惡不作，應該遺臭萬年，有人心地潔白，反而駡他遺臭萬年，一般奸刁之流，却恭維他流芳百世，眞是使人莫明其妙，無怪社會愈弄愈黑暗了。</p>
<p>跌在屎坑裏致死的人，雖則外表臭不可當，内心却很純潔，與其稱頌張三李四流芳百世，寗可稱頌屎坑裏的人，黑白究竟還能分明，不過他們拏錢買到流芳百世的稱頌話的，實則遺臭萬萬年呢。</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>天氣暴熱，人心也就暴躁，遇有急性的人，在那九十度以上的酷暑益發中心如火，躁急的了不得。要是，急性遇着慢性的人，往往不待詞畢，便有一種鹵莽的表示，以致鬧出許多笑話，我便記了出來··</p>
<p>張先生見他的佃農，被警察鎖着進城，鐵索鋃鐺，很是可憫，張先生說··「阿木林，你犯了什麽罪？」佃農說··「我犯了竊案。」「阿木林，這是你不好，偷了人家什麽東西？」「先生我没偷甚麽，只拾着一根草繩。」張先生怒說··「現在的刑法太苛刻了，你只拾着一根草繩，不該把你鎖着進城，如捕大盜。」佃農道··「我的說話没有完畢，我只拾着一根草繩，草繩上繫着人家拳養的牛，我便牽到自己家裏去。」</p>
<p>一個靑年，扭着一個老者到法院中去告狀，說老者把他吆吆喝喝，跡近侮辱，因此告他一�</p>
<p>狀。官間老者··「你有什麽權威，可以吆喝少年？你是何等樣人？」老者徐徐答道··「我是鄉下人。」問官怒道··「你原來是一個鄉愚，和少年非親非戚，你如何可以侮辱他？」老者道··「堂上莫怒，聽我畢其詞；我是鄉下人弗識駝子，呌做「脹背。」長輩敎訓示輩，這是理所當然，不算侮辱。」</p>
<p>「國奢示儉」的時代，往往大人先生，打扮的和鄉下老一般，要是「只認衣衫不認人，」便易鬧出笑話。尤其是崗警，非把那人問淸履歷，便不敢輕加詆訶。那時深夜，有一個短衣的人在道上行走崗警上前，訽間職業，那人道··「我是宰相。」崗警連忙立正行禮，以爲自稱宰相，不是前淸時代的大學士，定是民國時代國務總理。那人徐徐說道··「且莫行禮，我詞未畢，我是「宰相肚裏好撑船」的一個撑船人罷了。」</p>
<p>新生活運動時代，旅館中的茶房，也不敢在衣服上辨别階級。一天，有一個鄉曲來開房間；茶房笑容可掬，詢問客人職業。那人道··「我是大王」茶房大驚，知道大王便是大資本家的别號，無論鋼鐵大王，煤油大王，麫粉大王，稱到大王，至少總有數千萬的家私。於是，陪着小心，極盡其拍馬的能事；那人笑道··「你休拍馬，我詞未畢，我是大王廟中的一名香伙。」</p>

<p>第三十一回　　三次交鋒白衣衝雪陣　　全營殉國赤眼入槍林</p>
<p>自强聽得淸楚，這脚步聲巳經過去有四五百米達了，然後揣摸着敵人相當距離，吩咐機關槍兵，開始掃射。卜卜卜，這子彈打在敵人隊伍的身後。他們成縱隊走着，正還不曾疏開，猛然的由後面會發生了敵人，這是作夢想不到的事。而且前面己逼近寨子，若是向前進着，一定也要受那邊的迎擊。在這個時候，敵人陣裏，猛然發生一種嘩嘩的聲浪，大槪是在雪地裏亂跑的原故。這樣出其不意的一擊，無論他是天兵天將，也不能不有些張惶，加之這裏面有一部分漢奸，是逼迫而來的，更是張惶，掉轉身來，向夾溝裏就跟着回擊。在他們這樣回擊的時候，寨子裏的守軍，知道他們己經中計，也對準了他們的陣線放槍。敵人的統軍長官，知道在這地勢逼窄的所在，决不能分向兩面迎敵，因之立刻命令寇兵疏開臥倒，禁止回擊。趙自强在那夾溝上面，指揮着弟兄掃射了一頓，見敵人槍彈回擊，高低上下不定，分明是步武散亂了，大槪傷亡不少。只是敵人回擊了一陣之後，他偏向東方退却，突然的没有聲息了。若是糊裏糊塗的射擊，未免耗費子彈，在口外的軍隊，子彈打一粒少一粒，是不容易得着接濟的。因之自强也就停止了射擊，用步槍的刺刀，挑起一塊小白旗子，向對崖招了幾招。那邊一個排長會意，也有一面白的影子，在低處的空中招展着。於是自强率領着弟兄，沿了夾溝，緩緩的向前走。在敵人方面，知道中了伏兵，却想不到伏兵，僅僅只有一連，因之雖閃到夾口偏東的高地下，但决不肯讓華軍稍微再接近他們一點。這裏自强一連人進逼着，略微有點嚮動。那邊的敵人，勢逼處此，不能鎭靜着了，向着　　夾溝這面，也是用機槍掃射，對於遠的寨子裏，就用他們帶來的小鋼砲，同時轟擊。（四二五）</p>

<p>惠勃爾登冠軍保持者澳洲克勞福、淘汰美國台杯選手史篤芬、爲一極可觀之競爭、雙方發球、皆異常有力、兩人皆五相無方應付、尤以吏篤芬抽球及速度之管束力、使觀衆驚嘆不巳、但史於第三盤以五比四佔先時、忽一蹶不振、連失三局而敗、克勞福之得勝、尢爲可貴、　醫生曾令其不參加也、比賽旣畢、人扶之入更衣室、巳疲憊之堪、在比賽之中、克常露疲乏之態</p>
<h3 id="c208">希爾士勝奥斯汀 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>

<p>一、各校校長多非農工專業人才或對於職業敎育並具有優良經騐者、顯與規程不符、即應嚴加考核、對於資格不符、而任事又無成績者、務須分别撤換愼選合格人員接充、以資改進、</p>
<p>二、各校實習設備、如農塲·桑園·工廠·養蠶室等、非面積狹小、不敷應用、即設施簡陋有礙敎學、亟應擴充其範圍充實其内容、以收實效、如爲經費所限、不能增加預算、應分别情形、减少班級或酌量暫行停止一部或全部之招生將其餘欵、移充敎學設備之用、</p>
<p>三、各校實習材料費多不够用、應遵照規定、增加預算、</p>
<p>四、各校敎學多重講授、實習時間、所占甚少、且多先學後習、各學年實習時間、由少而多、每次實習有僅占二小時者、種種辦法均與規程不合、應速改進、</p>
<p>五、各校學生多富於升學觀念、而究其實際、每缺乏經濟能力、學校爲適應環境計、亦往往增設普通科目種類及授課時間、實與職業學校之目的不合、應注重技能學科、養成充分生産能力、以堅學生對於職業之信仰、</p>
<p>六、各校學生出品數量稀少、且多粗劣、殊少商品代價、其成績較優者、一切圖樣色彩品質等、亦多模仿社會上原有出品、缺少改良與提倡意養、</p>

<p>八、各校普通學科如數學·國文·理化等、所取敎材、不能與所習職業科目設法聯絡、每日二十分鐘課間操就實習工作時間内舉行、以調劑學生之身心、各校亦未遵辦、</p>
<p>九、各校敎職員之衣食住行、多未能表現刻苦耐勞之精神、爲學生表率、尤少與學生共同生活、　　十、皖北各校學生頗富於節儉刻苦精神、但對於衞生淸潔、整齊及勞作習慣、尚未養成、</p>
<p>十一、該省女子職業學校、由校供給膳宿、以示優待、因之學生衆多、惟對於注重女子職業培養經濟獨立能力之觀念、仍尚淡薄、致多視此爲升學之預備學校、</p>

<h3 id="c241">大衆語文運動之路 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 陶知行</p>
<p>胡愈之先生所下之大衆語之解釋很好，我想提出兩個字的修正。大衆語是代表大衆前進意識的話語。大衆文是代表前進意識的文字。</p>
<p>大衆語與大衆文必須合一··在程度上合一，在需要上合一，在意識上合一。</p>
<p>大衆語文適合大衆的程度，需要和意識時，在大衆本身所起的反應是高興。所以大衆語文是大衆高興說，高興聽，高興寫，高興看的語言文字。這高興的境界便是藝術的境界。　　一個月前，我從一家電影公司裏，借得一捲電影片子，送到鄉下去公映。我們想在公映前幾天敎農人讀說明書。這說明書雖是用白話文寫的，但是鄉下小先生不會敎，農人也讀不來。我只好重新寫一篇說明書來敎大家。這工作是不容易。我一連換了幾次稿才勉强寫成。據小先生說，我最後寫成的說明書，還嫌太深。但比了電影公司的原稿是淺了十倍也不止。這個例子說明現在通行的白話文只是把文文文的「之乎者也」換了「的嗎啊呀」</p>
<p>夾了一些外國文法和一些少爺小姐新士大夫的意識造成的。這種白話文，寫起來，大衆看不懂，讀起來大衆聽不懂。我們可以看出在中國文學運動裏是有一個大黑幕··白話文不與大衆語合一。</p>
<p>大衆是過着符號貧窮的生活。但是他們需要符號是鐵打的事實。老太婆用繩結記帳。農夫刻樹皮抒情。野孩子寫王八旦駡人。民衆學校學生用注音字母代替他所不會寫的字。這種需要更可以用一個故事來說明。從前有一位婦人寄了一封信給她的丈夫，丈夫打開一看，紙上畫的是··</p>
<p>「一個單圈，一個雙圈，一」個圓圈，一個破圈，一連許多圈。」</p>
<p>丈夫看不懂。一位聰明人把他夫人所畫的圈中秘密指點他說··</p>
<p>「欲寄相思無從寄，畫幾個圈兒替。單圈兒是我。雙　　圈兒是你。圓圈兒是團圓。破圈兒是别離。還有說不盡的心思，把一路的圈兒圈到底。」</p>
<p>這些例子指示出大衆的生活中是有一個大缺憾。大衆没有取得够用的思想的符號，情感的符號，行動的符號··總而言之，没有取得充分的生活的符號。大衆的符號是和大餅一樣的貧乏。剥削大衆的大餅的人是同時獨佔了大衆生活所需要的符號。</p>
<p>照這樣看來，大衆語文運動是有兩條大路可走··</p>
<p>（一）智識分子參加大衆生活，在大衆語演進的基礎上努力寫作語文合一的大衆文；</p>
<p>（二）將生活符號普及於大衆，使大衆自己創造出語文合一的大衆文。</p>
<p>智識分子要想寫大衆文必須先學大衆語。他必須拜大衆做老師。不够！他必須鑽進大衆的生活裏去與大衆共生活共甘苦。他必須是大衆隊伍裏的一位戰士。等他自己的生活與大衆的生活打成一片，然後他纔能領略大衆生活之酸甜苦辣；然後他寫大衆便是寫自己，寫自己便是寫大衆。如果他不屑拜大衆做老師，不肯在大衆的隊伍裏做一個小兵，他决寫不出好的大衆文。</p>
<p>拿什麽符號來向大衆普及？漢字呢？注音字母呢？拼音文呢？我的建議是三管齊下；漢字要敎；注音字母要敎；用注音字母拚成大衆文更要敎。</p>
<p>漢字是士大夫的法寳，大衆必須認得這法寳，纔能看破士大夫的神秘。能敎漢字的人有八千萬。漢字的本身雖難學但是能敎這符號的人如比之多是推廣運動的一個大便利。我以爲漢字只要認得就够了。帮助大衆認識漢字的一個方法，便是注音字母。大衆學會注音字母便可以自動去用字典，認生字，追求新知識。但是我們不能停頓在這裏。我們必須立刻敎導大衆運用注音字母去記錄自己的思想情感行動。我們必須立刻敎導大衆運用字母去寫大衆文。我們敎漢字的目的在使大衆認識那被漢字包圍的中國；我們敎字母的目的，小而言之在帮助多識漢字，大而言之在用秋蟬脫殼之方法創造拼音字來代替漢字，以産生拼音的大衆文。</p>
<p>我們做普及文字符號的工作時應當連帶提倡俗寫簡筆漢字，印寫字體合一，字母正草合一，以節省學習之時間精力。</p>
<p>中小學校及民衆學校之學生都該做起小先生來，每人至少敎兩個不識字的人。這樣一來，我們便有一千多萬有組織的分子來負起普及符號之重任。再加上八千萬識字民衆之進一步之培養及總動員，數年之間，必可使大衆取得他們生活所必需的符號。</p>
<p>大衆得到符號便能將自巳的生活。深刻的描寫出來。大衆的隊伍裏自有文藝的天才。他們自然而然的會産生出第一流的大衆文。</p>
<p>我們把文字符號傳給大衆的時候要做一番「濾淸」的工作。我們要把時代落伍的意識濾掉，要把麻醉的毒質濾掉，要把古典濾掉，要把洋文法濾掉。我們獻給大衆的符號是要和没有微生物的淸水一樣。大衆得了這種淸水的符號便能自由的，毫無成見的，寫出眞正的大衆文。</p>
<p>我想指出大衆語必以一種活的言爲基礎。中國四分之三的語人能懂的活的語言便是濾過的北平話。北平話又最好聽，好聽，人就願意學。因此，北平話實有成爲大衆語之主要成分之資格。但大衆語應當胆量大。凡與大衆前進生活有親切關係之各地土語，甚至於外國話都可儘量吸收。我們也不必懸一抽象的主觀的標凖，勉强加以去取。讓大衆自己去選擇好了。不合前進大衆的口味的必歸天然淘汰，用不着我們過慮。</p>
<p>抱有前進意識之大衆要領導意識落後之大衆把自己的生活提高起來··把程度提高，把需要，把意識提高。這樣，大衆語便能繼續不斷的提高，大衆文也就跟着牠繼續不斷的提高了。</p>

<h3 id="c244">關於金聖嘆批改的水滸（上） <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 余楊靈</p>
<p>六月三十日的「動向」上，有耳耶先生的「關於白話文底發生與成長」一文。全文的主意，我是贊同的，但是關於金聖嘆批水滸一節，我和耳耶先生的見解有點不同。這個問題本來有討論的價値，所以我也來談一下。</p>
<p>先看耳耶先生的原文··</p>
<p>譬如「水滸」，是一部有名的小說，是好多年在苦難中奮鬭中來的成果，而它最可取的地方，就在是用話寫的。然而我們底金聖嘆老爺怎麽說呢？他說這是「才子書」，他硬把它放在左史莊騷一塊兒！並且那書中有一點兒不像尊貴者羣底意識的地方丨强盜不是天生的不是壞人官老爺們反是壞人，逼人做强盜丨簡直使他忍不住。於是他竄改，他要「以丸泥封函谷」，他硬在那書中造出甚麽「微言大義」，「春秋筆法」來。據我的見解，金聖嘆把水滸和左史莊騷放在一起，尊之爲「才子書，」其中並無惡意，倒是極正確的見解，正和現在的批評家重視描寫黄包車夫的小說一樣。至於「才子書」云云，不過是明人習用的濫語，也和今人動不動便說「天才」「偉人」一樣。金聖嘆倘以「尊貴者羣底意識「來選書那是决不會選到水滸的，甚而他選到水滸了，而且把純然是故事的連綴的一百二十回本，删成七十回，這是一種有目的的工作，其目的就是暴露官僚政治的黑暗，指出梁山泊集團的社會的成因，贊揚游民階級的義氣。他把故事中寫得十分忠義，惟盼望招安的宋江，奚落得一文不値，試問這是何種意識。水滸五十一回中寫高俅的叔伯兄弟的舅子倚勢横行時，金聖嘆批道··</p>
<p>高俅無所不爲，猶可限也··高俅之伯叔兄弟無所不爲，胡可限也？高</p>
<p>俅之叔伯兄弟無所不爲，猶可限也；高俅之伯叔兄弟又有親戚，又復無所不爲，胡可限也？高俅之伯叔兄弟又有親戚又復無所不爲，猶可限也；高俅伯叔兄弟之親戚又當各有其狐狗奔走之徒，又當各各無所不爲，胡可限也？嗚呼！天下者，朝廷之天下也，百姓者，朝廷之赤子也；今也，縱不可限之虎狼，張不可限之饞吻，奪不可限之肌肉，塡不可限之谿壑，而欲民之不畔，國之不亡，胡可得也！」</p>
<p>這一段說明官僚政治下的無限的剥削及其必然的結果，豈能說是出於「尊貴者羣的意識？」</p>

<h3 id="c265">建設「大衆語文」應有的認識 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 若生</p>
<p>從「文言」「白話」底爭論所引起的「大衆語」問題，最近幾天來，己經討論得很熱鬧。這問題在現階段被提出，無疑的，是有着非常實踐的意義和迫切的需要。</p>
<p>語言和文字，本來只是人類社會過程中的産物，如果社會底基礎建築一有改變，那麽代表社會意識的語文，就不能不跟着逐漸改變，否則它將成爲社會進化上的障礙了。現在我們的這個社會，舊的一方面，己很快的在没落下去，新的一方面也逐漸在生長起來，爲了要表現這新的意識，自應有一種新的語文産生，這便是「大衆語」。</p>
<p>但是我們從這幾天討論的各方面看來，對這問題，意見還很不一致。我們以爲「大衆語文」不僅是絶對的反「古文」的丨丨代表「封建意識的古文」，同時也相對的反「白話的丨丨現在流行的那些代表」官僚買辦意識底變相八股或語錄體之類的白話。我們要執行這兩重任務，首先要從語文發展的社會關係和語文的本身上，求得個澈底的了解，認淸它們中間的對立和統一性。所以現在許多人以爲「古文復興」是没有多大意義，或者以爲「大衆語文」只是反對「古文」，並不反對「白話」，都只看到事物一面，而不曾看到它的整體。</p>
<p>現在的所謂「古文復興」，雖然祗是一種没落階層底臨死爭扎，不會有多大的前途，可是你如果不去澈底淸除掉，究竟會障礙整個語文的進步的。這好像一間屋子裏，放着一個患着很危險的傳染病底人，或己經死了的屍體，如果不趕快把它送進醫院裏去或埋葬掉，對於其餘健康的是多麽有害。同樣，目前這種中國舊語文的精靈鬼怪，又重行化裝出現，到處作怪迷人，像樂嗣炳先生這樣健康的人，也會受的迷惑，其餘更不知有多少哩！（參看六月廿三日自由談）所以我們在建設「大衆語文」的現階段，對於這種「五四剩下來的文章」，還是要做的（這後面還要講到），並且要用戰鬥的精神來對付它，非給它的一個最後的致命打擊，使它早日滅亡不可。何况這種「古文復興」運動，事實上還不僅是幾個人底别有用心，是跟着整個社會的復古傾向而來的。</p>
<p>至於從「五四運動」所興起的白話，是那時新興資産階級要求民主政治的一種表現、在反封建上果然己盡過很大的任務，但因他們階級本身的缺陷，不能進一步幹個澈底。他們只在字面上「白」「不白」的兜圈，不敢深入到社會的底層去和大衆相聯繫，所以留了一條給「封建」復興的路。另一方面，更因戰後國際帝國主義的加緊壓迫和其他的關係，反使他們遠離了大衆而回頭去和封建携手妥洽了。在語文上也祗將「之乎者焉」換了「的那呢嗎」的變相八股。</p>
<p>今天「動向」　登載王鋼先生一篇文章，以爲「建設大衆語」並不反對「白語文」。假使王先生底話是對，那末禮拜六派的文章，張恨水的小說，和戴上了「風格」「性靈」「語錄體」這些面具出現（借用胡愈之先生話）的東西，不是都用白話（大衆語？）寫的，我們何必再要建設「大衆語文」？提倡「大衆語文」豈不是多事？王先生批評别人機械地對立起來，自己却說··「在這個反復古運動反文言文」的戰鬥中，决没有反對「白話文」的理由，大家不但要建設大衆語，而且也要「白話文」，這才是機械地把它們對立起來。</p>
<p>「大衆語文」到底是什麽呢？「大衆語文」和「白話」完全不同麽？自然不是的。「大衆語文」並不是從天上掉下來，或地下生起來的，它是跟大衆底實踐同發屬的，這點在前面巳經說過。所以「大衆語文」並不完全反對「白話」，它是跟「白話」相對的對立面又統一的。換句話說，「大衆語文」是「白話」的高一　，　發展了「白話」的某一部分，而揚棄别一部分；它是「白話」之否定。</p>
<p>從上面我們巳簡略地指出「古文」「白話」「大衆語文」三者之間的區别性和同一性，以及建設「大衆語文」是爲了什麽。至於進一步指出怎樣才算「大衆語文」，下次再討論。同時要大衆共同來討論，「大衆語文」是大衆的！</p>

<p>本十年來未有之大熱，己連着有一星期之久了，而且照情形看來，三數日内不見得能跌進百度之内。而時疫院裏巳告人滿，每天暴斃路死者遍遍皆是，這可怕的記載似乎使上海人喘喘不安起來，因爲這不幸的事件每個人不能設法去避免牠。在這三百萬人口的大都市中，資産階級倒底是少數中的少數，他們可以到莫干山普陀去避暑，就是住在上海的高大的洋房中，也有海冰浴塲及夜花園等淸夏勝地供給他們去消遺。除了之外的中下階級，無論是勞心勞力，他們下能爲了水銀拉升到一百度以上而停止工作，而這一類人們的飲食起居，往往容易被時疫之魔所侵入，所以時疫的死亡者可以武斷的說十句勞　階級佔了最多數，致於高貴的人們，這六十年來</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>未有之大熱無論堅持到幾星期之上，和他們是絲毫也没有關係的。</p>
<p>咱們一般賣稿生活的文人，在這大熱天氣，揮汗寫稿，雖較黄包車夫苦力等奔跑於烈日之下高出萬倍，但是勞心與勞力，相距亦不過五十步與百步耳。然而比之一般每星夜望着斗的農夫們觀來，我們應該知足，接連着說是兩年大豐收，但是米　的操縱，地租的壓迫，農民是反比從前平常的收成不如了，榖賤到竟使他們不够種田時的本，他們終年的辛苦，反負了許多債。然而在重重壓近之下，他們仍是希望着今年大豐收之後榖價飛漲，償淸他們的欠債，再快快活活活一個年？如果一切遂了他們的企求，也不能抵償他們的千辛萬苦！最近一個星期來的奇熱，農民是如何地大失望所望呵，他們生命的泉源丨稻秧剛是初出水面的嫩芽，如何受得起幾天的奇熱？他們是從早晨到夜，一刻不停地用他們的兩腿不辭辛勞地車水，脚底上的水泡痛得不能走路，但是他們不能不車水。說到牛罷，這是農民們最高貴的財産，他們不願牠做過多的工作；而且二次失豐年，他們最高貴的財産都忍痛賤賣來補償他們的債項。現在眼見又是個大荒年，試愈農民的痛苦又是如何呢？</p>
<h3 id="c269">記麥倫中學公演 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 丹楓</p>
<p>天氣是這樣悶熱，人們都不能暢快的呼吸，誰都渴望着暴風雨的到臨。麥倫中學所約請的藝人們，就在這熱烈而苦悶的情緒之下，來了一次大規模的公演。</p>
<p>自然，這一次公演是深深的獲得了觀衆的熱烈的同情，這從各報近日來之反應的文字上看來，乃是呆以得着充分證明的。的確，中國的戲劇運動，以一九三零年的「炭坑夫」或「西綫無戰事」爲</p>
<p>起點，經過了「怒吼罷中國」，直到今年的「高貴的人們」，「月亮上升」，「吼」，「金寳」以至於這一次「警報」，「揚子江的暴風雨「「出走後的娜拉」爲止，無論是在劇本的内容或者是演出的形式，都可看出明顯的進步之痕迹。雖然我們承認，都不能獲得百分之百的成功，但是這一次成功和失敗的比重，前者是優於後者的。</p>
<p>這一次公演是四個戲，除了「雪裏行商」我始終没有看到之外，其他的三劇，我都二次以上。每個觀衆都留下强烈的印象，我亦得寫出一些蕪雜的意見，以供參與這一次公演的人們之參考。　　易卜生的娜拉，她離開了家庭將走向何處去呢？這在五四時代乃是大家所注意的問題。現在，這一問題在這「出走後的娜拉「中有了解答了。她們在這舊的社會中，在半殖民地的中國，在舊禮敎的殘殺之下，她們唯一的出路，便是和勞苦大衆合流而走向爭鬥的前途。這一主題的提出，在原則上講自然是並不歪曲的。然而我們的劇作者在表現技術上，却没有充分的給與觀衆强調的眞實感；我們總覺得胡萍所飾的角色，她有那般華麗的衣服，那般多情的丈夫，大槪不會因着丈夫的消極投降而和她丈夫離異的。否則便是描寫得過於不够。假使說作者寫了她愛情的毁滅，更因着帝國主義的大砲推毁了她的家庭經濟，再不然作者得將其寫成一個從事社會運動的健全的女性，那末作者的所期望的效果，多少是可以少打折扣的。又如那，老母親，她下毒手殺兒女與自殺的過程，也是寫得非常突然的。而且我以爲我們使她殺兒女以敎觀衆仇恨她，那就得加强她頑固的個性，毒辣的陰謀，這樣也許效果更大許多罷，可不是嗎？一個母親殺死兒女，該是如何可怕而嚴肅的事啊。他如新聞記者的對話似乎有許多也是多餘的至少是關於服毒經過的重述。</p>
<p>就因着劇本還有許多技術上的缺點，以致在演出上頗不容易討好。一般的說，這一個三幕劇是不成功，雖然個别的說來，演員如胡萍，顧夢鶴，趙丹，王紅翼·朱銘仙等都有相當的成績。關於這戲，我不想多說，希望作者好好的將劇本改作一下。一日晚的成績比較三十日晚是要純熟一些的</p>
<p>而另一方面，「揚子江的暴風雨」和「警報」，無論在劇本或演出方面，却有很大的成功。先說前者，無疑的是開始了中國歌劇之活動，而且是採取了新的内容和形式。當然我們也覺得還有許多値得改善的地方，如三十晚的一塲，我們便覺得第一幕有許是不必要的，至少第一幕有許多話可以在第二幕開始時說出來。果然，最後一塲上演的時候，没有第一幕，一開始便是歌一直到在悲壯的歌聲中閉幕，都是非常緊湊；悲壯的詩，粗綫條的圖畫。然而假使有可能，經過劇作者的改作，第一幕的内容可以拚合於第二幕中去，第一幕的室内塲面便可略去。同時音響效果，也得弄得更緊張複雜一點。至於單純而充實的内容，他指示出揚子江邊的勞苦大衆，在帝國主義勢力之下掙扎着，他們共同的道路，便祗有不給他們運軍火；不給他們建築洋麥堆棧，一致向前參加直接爭鬥，在血花和槍彈之中爭取勝利的前途。　　最後我們要說到的便是以描寫水災爲題材的「警報」了。</p>
<p>毫無疑義的，這又是一個很成功的作品。誰是水災的製造者，在這裏告訴得我們非常明白。老百姓捐了許多修堤的附加稅，但是錢到那兒去了呢？水利局長拿鴉片發意，自己帶着小老婆上省城去，以千百萬堤下的生命爲兒戲，於是堤下的人們覺悟了，搶險，救自己的生命，祗有自己救自己。這樣現實的題材，這樣正確的主題，在風聲，雨聲，雷聲，鑼聲，羣衆的呼喊聲中，廣大的堤下的人們，英勇的悲壯的，和人爲天災鬥爭起來了。</p>
<p>上述二戲，都獲得極大的成功，無論是導演，佈景，燈光以至於音響效果，都獲得極大的成功。特别是全部的演員，在導演適當支配之下，在他們努力之下能够彼此照應，誰都是恰如其量的成功。聶耳的老人，在「揚子江的暴風雨」中，他是那般沉着。王瑛的英勇，璐璐的頑强，小演員海南的呼號，以及每一個羣衆的音樂旋律的動作，都是恰到好處。一在警報中袁牧之老人，鄭君里的覺悟靑年，趙丹的靑農，朱銘仙的大嬸，吳楣的農婦，以至於小毛頭的和海南的兄妹，（特别海南的聞雷掩耳），誰都是十分賣力而顯出極大的天才。充分的表現眞實，乃是他們極大成就，而袁牧之和聶耳的化裝，更爲神妙。</p>
<p>好了，以上二戲，總合的說來，眞實感的充分流露，應當承受一切華美的腴詞，而這正是劇本内容所决定，乃是不必解釋的了。最後，我們除了對於主持與參加這一次公演的人們，表示竭誠敬意之外，我們深深相信，中國戲劇運動，的確是在艱難困苦之中，勇敢的進步了。</p>

<p>Someone Loitering Near the Rail Bridge in Lei Zhuang the Night Before</p>
<p>Road Police Arrest One Person, Remaining Accomplices Commit Assault</p>
<p>Bureau Actively Preventing Further Accidents</p>
<p>Additional Detectives Dispatched to Inspect Bridges and Railroad Tracks</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 2nd night at 9 PM, two bandits were loitering near the North Ning Road's No. 54 rail bridge in Lei Zhuang, and were spotted by road police. One was captured and immediately sent to the Lei Zhuang police station. The one who escaped summoned eight accomplices, who secretly approached the bridge late at night, stabbed and injured police officer Li Zhiming in more than ten places before fleeing. Upon hearing of this, the First Brigade of bridge guards pursued, but it was too late. Liang Huannai, the secretary-general of the North Ning Railway Bureau, returned to Tianjin and immediately went to Ping [Beijing] to report to Yin Tong. Regarding Yin Tong's telegram to the Ministry of Railways tendering his resignation, the North Ning Railway Bureau has not yet received a reply from the Ministry. Ordinary bureau affairs are being temporarily handled by the two deputy directors, while important matters are stalled. Regarding the compensation for the passengers injured in the tea-dregs [Cha Dian] bombing, the North Ning Railway Bureau has telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, requesting that generous compensation be given outside of the railway regulations. Today, the number of passengers passing through Tianjin on the Ping-Shen [Beijing-Shenyang] through train has greatly decreased, as everyone is terrified of the Cha Dian incident and reluctant to proceed. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping [Beijing]) Yi Wo, the head of the Kwantung Army's Yuguan [Shanhaiguan] Special Service Organ, who came to Beiping yesterday morning, met with Yin Tong and Chaisan once, and returned to Tianjin in the evening. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping [Beijing]) The North Ning Railway Bureau has instructed the police department and the transportation department to strictly inspect passengers' luggage and packages, and has stipulated that the inspection be divided into four sections: 1. The Ping-Feng [Beijing-Fengtai] section, to be the responsibility of the Qianmen police section; 2. The Jin-Tang [Tianjin-Tanggu] section, to be the responsibility of the Tianjin police section; 3. The Tang-Luan [Tangshan-Luanzhou] section, to be the responsibility of the Tangshan police section; 4. The Qin-Yu [Qinhuangdao-Yushugou] section, to be the responsibility of the Qinhuangdao police section. The inspection method is that, regardless of whether it is on the train or at the station, passengers' luggage and items should be inspected at any time. Female passengers should not be searched lightly. Suspicious passengers should be taken to the respective sections for questioning, and should not be deliberately delayed. In addition, the police department will dispatch additional patrol teams and plainclothes detectives to secretly monitor along the train lines at all times. People will be dispatched at all times to inspect bridges and tracks along the line to prevent further accidents. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping [Beijing]) The bombed Ping-Shen [Beijing-Shenyang] train has been sent to Tangchang [Tangshan Factory] for repairs, and has been replaced with a third-class train bearing the Jing-Feng [Beijing-Fengtian] designation. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping [Beijing]) Yin Tong's intention to resign is firm. He intends to leave Beiping to find a place to recuperate. Starting today, he will stop reviewing documents and telegrams, and will quietly wait for the Ministry of Railways to send someone to handle the handover. The Ping-Shen [Beijing-Shenyang] through train does not have tea or water available on the dining car, which passengers find quite inconvenient. Japanese people traveling between Ping [Beijing] and Shen [Shenyang] are sometimes found to be boarding without tickets and temporarily charging to accounts, which violates regulations. The Railway Bureau has forwarded the matter to the Eastern Travel Agency to negotiate with the Japanese side. The date stamps on the ticket stubs sold in the Guandong [Manchuria] section have been found to have numbers such as "172". According to the Ping-Shen [Beijing-Shenyang] through train rules, decided by the Tianjin Sino-Japanese representatives meeting, passenger tickets should be printed and sold entirely by the Eastern Travel Agency, with major stations in the Guannei [inside the Pass] section acting as sales agents. The dates on the passenger tickets should use the Western calendar, temporarily stamped, so all three stubs should have "193_ year _ month _ day" printed on them, and other dates should not be filled in. This time, the tickets sold in the Guandong [Manchuria] section were filled in as "19317 year 2 month of day," which is inconsistent with the original rules and may involve the use of a forged calendar. Moreover, a fake organization in Yuguan [Shanhaiguan] collects entry permit fees from passengers, which over time will invisibly create a national border, which is worrying for the future. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping [Beijing]) When the Japanese police accompanying the Ping-Shen [Beijing-Shenyang] train were first proposed by the Japanese side, they said it was to prevent the activities of Japanese and Korean vagrants, so the Chinese and Japanese sides agreed to a one-week limit. It is unknown whether the Japanese side will use the Cha Dian incident as an excuse to extend the period indefinitely. According to relevant sources, it is hoped that the withdrawal will be carried out as scheduled. If they extend the period under some pretext, our side will resolutely fight according to the agreed-upon method. Yin Tong said that according to reports, a lightly injured young man with evasive speech and suspicious circumstances was found at the scene of the Cha Dian incident. He has now been sent to Tianjin for treatment. He will be interrogated after he recovers. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping [Beijing]) Ota Hisashi, the head of the puppet Fengshan Railway Bureau, arrived in Beiping this morning from Tianjin, accompanied by Tanaka, the chief of the documentation section of the railway bureau, and three other railway employees, Hirata and Otsu. Ota said that he had departed from Shenyang to inspect the road conditions after the Ping-Shen [Beijing-Shenyang] through train. He first went to Yuguan [Shanhaiguan] to inspect the Eastern Travel Agency, where the situation was good. He came to Beiping to visit Yin Tong to discuss all matters related to the Ping-Shen [Beijing-Shenyang] through train in the future. It was very unexpected that the first Ping-Shen [Beijing-Shenyang] through train encountered an accident at Cha Dian. Both sides are stepping up inspections to avoid the recurrence of unfortunate incidents. The Japanese side has not expressed any opinion on the handling of the matter. He plans to visit Yin tomorrow. Since there is no need, he does not intend to visit He [Yingqin]. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>(Beiping [Beijing]) Yin Rugeng went to Tianjin to meet with Yu [Xuezhong] to request instructions on how to negotiate various issues in the war zone. After completing the task, he returned to Beiping last night. This morning, he met with Tao Shangming at his private residence to discuss the negotiation of war zone matters. In the afternoon, he visited Chaisan for preliminary discussions. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping [Beijing]) Yin [Rugeng] said that the issue of receiving Malanyu [Eastern Qing Tombs] has been negotiated with the Japanese side repeatedly, and it can be realized soon. Yin Tixin will come to Beiping from Tianjin tonight and will go to arrange and prepare for the takeover in the next few days. He himself will also go to participate in the takeover in the next few days. Our side has decided to expand the management committee for the Eastern Tombs issue to take on the responsibility of safeguarding it. The war zone security team and the public security bureaus of various counties will be thoroughly reorganized to protect the local area. Huang Yinzhang [Huang Fu] will go to Shanghai to prepare to go to Moganshan to meet with Chiang [Chiang Kai-shek]. The date of his return north has not yet been set. It is expected to be around the 15th. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Puppet Officials, High and Low, Cannot Act Independently <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>They Can Only Obey the Whims of the Japanese</p>
<p>(Beiping [Beijing]) A person from Guandong [Manchuria] said that puppet officials, high and low, live in fear under the surveillance of Japanese advisory officers. Recently, a certain puppet provincial governor appointed a county magistrate during the absence of the advisory officer. After the advisory officer returned, he flew into a rage at the governor, rebuking him for acting arbitrarily, and ordered the appointed county magistrate not to take office. The next morning, before the provincial governor had gotten out of bed, he led dozens of Japanese soldiers, fully armed with cannons and machine guns, as if facing a formidable enemy, launching an attack towards the provincial governor's bedroom. Then, he forced the governor to kowtow to the advisory officer and pledge that he would not act independently in the slightest in the future. Only then was the governor's life spared. In the past, the Japanese advisory officers only recommended positions up to the county level. Now, because there are so many Japanese adventurers and not enough positions to go around, the advisory officers have come up with new tricks. Guidance officers are set up in each bureau below the county level, and guidance personnel are set up in each district. They must follow orders in everything, large or small.

<p>(Tianjin) Today, I inquired with the responsible postal authorities here about the postal issue. According to them, this matter is related to the Universal Postal Union, and our side does not want it to be realized. The Japanese side also believes that there are more harms than benefits after the opening of postal service. Inspecting letters will be a great hassle. Therefore, the current problem is turning cold. However, because the through train has been realized, there are inevitably postal items brought along with the train, but these are all carried by private individuals and cannot be recognized as formal postal service.

The Jiangxian [River hazards] points such as Sunkuaishi and Mantianxing in the upper reaches of Yilan are nearly impassable because of the low water level. Large ships cannot pass through.

<p>(Nanjing) The financial authorities are sparing no effort in carefully considering the increase and decrease of the revised customs import tariffs. Taking paper as an example, China has no large paper mills. Printing bureaus and businesses hope that the paper tax will be reduced so that production costs can be reduced and books can be sold more easily. Paper manufacturers, on the other hand, hope that the tax rate will be increased so that they can obtain high prices and profits. In addition, luxury goods are not related to production, and tariffs on metals and chemical products that can be manufactured domestically are moderately increased to protect domestic products. These are all decided after careful consideration based on the actual situation in order to achieve fairness and are compared with the current customs import tariffs of various countries, and they are still slight. After the new tariffs are implemented, tax revenue can be increased, which will be beneficial to the central finances and can also be used to reorganize domestic and foreign debts.

<h3 id="e33">A Glimpse into the Inside Story of the German Coup <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>There has been talk for weeks about a potential coup in Germany. Unexpectedly, before the coup could even be launched, Hitler swiftly suppressed it with lightning speed. The swiftness of his actions has been praised by many. However, whether those suppressed by Hitler were enemies or loyal followers of his own party remains questionable. This is because the main force behind the anticipated coup was believed to be the Reichswehr (German army). Yet, those actually punished by Hitler were the Sturmabteilung (SA), or Storm Troopers, which he himself created. Furthermore, according to German telegrams, the Reichswehr also mobilized to assist during the arrest of the SA leaders, raising the first point of suspicion. The Reichswehr, known for its right-wing leanings, assisted Hitler. Therefore, it seems unlikely that Kurt von Schleicher, a former Reichswehr leader, should have been killed by Hitler. However, the reality proves otherwise, raising the second point of suspicion. Vice-Chancellor Franz von Papen, a well-known restorationist and a confidant of Hindenburg, was also involved. If Hitler's actions were instigated by the right wing, then monitoring Papen seems pointless, raising the third point of suspicion. Moreover, according to German officialdom's declarations, aside from Hitler's anger at his followers' immorality, scandalous behavior, and extravagant lifestyle, the purpose of Hitler's actions remains unclear. In reality, since Hitler's rise to power, countless of his followers have become nominal members of large industrial and commercial enterprises, enjoying substantial salaries. Why would Hitler, who has always been tolerant, suddenly become strict today? This raises the fourth point of suspicion. With these four suspicions, we do not know whether Hitler's astonishing actions were truly to eradicate the left wing for the right wing, or to suppress the right wing for the left wing, or to genuinely eliminate corrupt elements within the party. Before the truth is fully revealed, we cannot make a definitive judgment. However, observing the developments after the rise of the National Socialist Party, Hitler's recent actions seem to symbolize the gradual rise of the right wing.</p>
<p>The National Socialist Party's past victories have all been aided by the middle class, small merchants, and small farmers. Therefore, when it rose, commentators all spoke of the rise of the middle class. However, facts from the past year and a half have proven that small merchants and small farmers have not received the special benefits promised by the Nazi Party's program. The small merchants hoped that the Nazi Party would implement its policies of closing department stores and supporting retailers. The small and poor farmers hoped for the confiscation of large estates and the abolition of usury. However, the Nazi Party only paid lip service and did not deliver. The reason for this breach of promise is that before the National Socialist Party came to power, it had already received funding from the financial community and large industrial enterprises. After taking power, general financial and industrial institutions, department stores, and large-scale cooperatives all successively appointed National Socialist Party members as committee members, giving them supervisory positions with very generous salaries. Jewish-owned stores were entirely managed by National Socialist Party members. Therefore, their interests not only did not conflict with those of the big capitalists, but were also intertwined. It is difficult to expect them to keep their pre-election promises. The failure to confiscate large estates and the failure to reduce interest rates on farmers' loans are similar problems.</p>
<p>However, this kind of change in life is still limited to the middle-level members of the National Socialist Party, while the changes among the upper-level members are even greater. Hitler's relationship with the major financier Hjalmar Schacht and the major steel industrialist Fritz Thyssen are the most prominent examples. Hitler's campaign funds for the several elections in 1932 largely came from these two individuals. This is the first reason for Hitler's right-wing leanings. Hitler's right-hand man, Hermann Göring, recently married the daughter of the German steel magnate Fritz Thyssen, further strengthening his relationship with industrialists. Göring's right-wing leanings have always been the most pronounced among the National Socialist Party leaders. Now that Hitler has eliminated dissidents, Göring is of paramount importance and extremely effective. This is the second reason for Hitler's right-wing leanings.</p>
<p>In summary, based on Hitler's actions over the years and his current actions, it seems that he has already leaned towards the embrace of the big capitalists. He fears a left-wing uprising, so he is carrying out a large-scale massacre with preemptive measures to rebuild his waning prestige and make his followers blindly follow him. However, whether the National Socialist Party members, after this stimulation, can remain eternally loyal to Hitler remains to be proven by facts. The exposure of the corrupt lives of National Socialist Party members has given the people a very bad impression. Whether they can still cherish the National Socialist Party's ideology is also uncertain.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that the junk sailors of Shierxu (a salt production area) are妄想(妄想) to restore the old system of "帆二輪一" (one rotation of sails every two trips). As a result, forty-odd batches of Anhui salt transported by junk and nearly two hundred batches of salt that have been recently changed to sails have been delayed in loading, using this as coercion. The Ministry of Finance has cabled the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Salt Transportation Commissioner of Lianghuai to instruct workers and boat owners to transport the above-mentioned salt within fifteen days. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance believes that transporting salt by junk is outdated and is actively preparing to set up factories for the junk sailors and introduce them to other occupations.

<p>In Office for Two Years and One Month</p>
<p>The Future of Political Power Awaits Saionji's Decision</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The cabinet convened at 10:25 AM this morning and unanimously resolved to resign en masse. Thus, the Saito Cabinet, which took office on May 22, 1932, came to an end. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Justice Oyama visited Prime Minister Saito at 7:10 AM this morning to deliver the final report on the bribery case in the Ministry of Finance. Prime Minister Saito also summoned Minister of Railways Mitsuchi, Minister of Navy Osumi, and Minister of Commerce Matsumoto before the cabinet meeting at 10:25 AM to inform them of the decision to resign en masse and seek the understanding of the cabinet members. Minister of Finance Takahashi also arrived at the Prime Minister's residence at 9:40 AM. The cabinet meeting was held at 10:25 AM. Prime Minister Saito stood up and, with a somber expression, reported the bribery case in the Ministry of Finance and the bribery facts of former cabinet members, saying that the current cabinet must take responsibility and resign en masse. The atmosphere was extremely sad throughout the meeting. (3rd Hualian Electric)</p>
<h3 id="e56">Listening to the Report of the Minister of Justice <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After Prime Minister Saito met with Minister of Justice Oyama this morning and listened to his report on the Ministry of Finance incident, he attended the cabinet meeting at 10:20 AM. As a result of consulting with the members on the attitude the cabinet should take, it was decided to resign en masse. (3rd Nichiren Electric)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito maintained a wait-and-see attitude for more than forty days since the Ministry of Finance incident was discovered. Today, after listening to the report from Minister of Justice Oyama and understanding all the facts, he decided to resign to take responsibility. He attended the cabinet meeting and said to the members that the purpose of the current cabinet's establishment was to rectify discipline. However, a discipline problem has occurred within this cabinet, which is intolerable. We should immediately take this responsibility and resign en masse. All cabinet members expressed their agreement with the Prime Minister's tragic decision. The Prime Minister then took the resignation letters of all members to the Imperial Palace.

<p>(Tokyo) At 11:50 AM this morning, the cabinet meeting had decided on the cabinet's resignation en masse. Prime Minister Saito immediately gathered the resignation letters of all cabinet members and entered the palace to meet with the Emperor. He presented the resignation letters with a letter of reasons, the general idea being that a discipline problem had occurred within the government departments, which had caused public sentiment to waver, and he was afraid. He immediately submitted his resignation and requested permission. The Emperor instructed that he should continue to oversee political affairs until there was an order. The Prime Minister withdrew and reopened the cabinet meeting to convey the imperial decree. The Emperor summoned Makino Naifu (Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal) to inquire. Makino Naifu replied that he should inquire of Prince Saionji. Thereupon, Vice-Chamberlain Hirohata was ordered in the afternoon to go to Gotemba to convey the Emperor's inquiry to Prince Saionji. If Prince Saionji replies immediately, then the trend of political power can be determined tomorrow (i.e., the 4th). If Prince Saionji comes to Tokyo, it may be delayed for two or three days.

<p>Prime Minister Saito, Who Resigned Yesterday</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The news of the Saito Cabinet's resignation en masse has been conveyed to Prince Saionji, who is taking summer vacation in Gotemba. Prince Saionji has decided to enter Tokyo at 7:00 AM on the 4th in order to reply to the Emperor's inquiry regarding the selection of the succeeding cabinet. Due to Prince Saionji's entry into Tokyo, the decision on the succeeding cabinet will still take two or three days. (3rd Dentsu Electric)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Yamamoto, the Minister of Interior, made the following statement regarding the cabinet's resignation en masse: Today, after Minister of Justice Oyama's report, the whole picture of the incident has been completely clarified. Therefore, according to the Prime Minister's decision, it was decided to resign en masse. As for the reasons, it is not only because of the Ministry of Finance incident, as has been spread in society. Also, regarding the matter of the succeeding cabinet, I have nothing to say. (3rd Dentsu Electric)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The direct reason for the Saito Cabinet's resignation en masse was the embezzlement case of the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Taiwan, which caused losses to the national treasury and allowed the Mitsui zaibatsu (financial combine) to reap a huge profit of 17 million yuan. Moreover, because the cabinet was a puppet of political parties and drove out the fascists, the fascists cooperated with the court's prosecution bureau and decided to carry out the so-called legal May 15 Incident. If the cabinet stubbornly arrests senior officials, there would be many. It is said that the prosecution bureau plans to hold another major case as follows: (1) The embezzlement case of the Sakhalin Industrial Company, in which former Minister of Education Hatoyama is involved. (2) The steel contract and the Kobe Steel case, in which former Minister of Commerce Nakajima is involved. (3) The Nanyo Kohatsu Company case, in which Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai is involved. (4) The small financial company case, in which the Ministry of Finance, the Bank, and officials of all ranks are involved. If the cabinet is unwilling to resign to take responsibility, the military閥(閥) feudal forces and the judicial officials' cooperative May 15 Renovation Group will carry out their original plan. As a result, many財閥(財閥) and political party leaders will be injured. In order to reduce the sacrifices, it was decided to resign en masse. (3rd Hualian Electric)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) In today's report by Minister of Justice Oyama, there was a sentence stating that a certain former cabinet member is highly suspected and cannot avoid prosecution, and that the current cabinet member is also highly suspected and cannot avoid investigation. Thus, the legal world will affect important figures. (3rd Dentsu Electric)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The real reason why the Saito Cabinet had to resign en masse was that a certain former cabinet member was guilty, and the prosecution authorities are seriously investigating his crimes and procedures. If it proceeds as expected, a summons will be issued in two or three days. (3rd Dentsu Electric)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Speculation on Successor Candidates <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>It is Hoped that Saito Makoto Will Rise Again and Form a Cabinet</p>
<p>The Theory That Yamamoto Will Succeed is Also Quite Strong</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Who will be the successor to the cabinet? This is the goal of the nation's attention. Combining information from all sides, it seems difficult for Governor-General Ugaki to be realized due to the strong opposition from the military. The theory of Privy Council President Ichiki forming a cabinet cannot be believed, because there is a major reason why Ichiki assumed the position of Privy Council President. The senior vassals are unwilling to easily change his position. As for the Kiyoura cabinet theory, because he is too old and his relationship with the military is not as close as it used to be, although there are various rumors in the world, his succession theory does not seem to be realized. From this point of view, the view that Saito Makoto will form a cabinet again can be said to be the most powerful. The second Saito cabinet will be organized with a restructuring policy, and it is also possible that the political parties will support its future. (3rd Nichiren Electric)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) To what kind of person will Prince Saionji奏請(奏請, formally request the emperor) regarding the selection of the leader of the succeeding cabinet? All aspects are paying close attention. However, Prince Saionji and Makino Naifu both seem to advocate that in order to deal with the situation, it is not appropriate to choose an unreasonable path. Before entering the palace on the 4th, it is said that they plan to discuss with Makino Naifu and other senior vassals before奉答(奉答, formally reply to the emperor) to the Emperor. From the fact that Prince Saionji will return to Gotemba on the same day and the circumstances of his surroundings, it is likely that he will still奏請(奏請) that the imperial command be降(降, bestow, as in the Emperor bestow an order) to Saito again, as a plan to quickly resolve the political situation. It is said that if Prime Minister Saito forms a cabinet again, in order to make the people feel refreshed, he may decide to make a major restructuring of the current cabinet. (3rd Nichiren Electric)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the time when the Saito Second Cabinet theory is strong, suddenly the Yamamoto Cabinet theory has appeared, and its momentum cannot be underestimated. The reason for the Saito Cabinet's resignation is not only because of the Ministry of Finance incident, but also because of the奏請(奏請) to the Emperor to appoint a certain cabinet member, and he resigned for political responsibility. Therefore, from the standpoint of responsible politics, the cabinet formation order will never降(降) to Saito. According to the opinion of powerful figures in the political world, it is most appropriate to recommend the current Minister of Interior Yamamoto Tatsuo as the leader of the succeeding cabinet. Although Yamamoto has a Minseitō (Constitutional Democratic Party) membership, his party color is quite weak, and his qualifications are older than Suzuki and Wakatsuki. Therefore, the Yamamoto Cabinet theory suddenly became stronger. (3rd Nichiren Electric)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Who will be the first class of the succeeding cabinet? Although it is chaotic and unclear, it is not allowed to predict. However, the majority of the military's intentions are that in order to break through the extraordinary situation, rather than organizing a mixed cabinet, it is better to have a person who can gather people who can make more contributions to be appointed. From this point of view, they support Baron Hiranuma. (3rd Dentsu Electric)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) At today's policy investigation report meeting of the Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government Party), President Suzuki strongly advocated the establishment of a Minister without Portfolio system in order to realize a cabinet united across the country. This is a very interesting issue for the government, political parties, and other various senses, and it is generally attracting attention. (3rd Nichiren Electric)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the resignation en masse of the Saito Cabinet, the financial and business circles unanimously advocated that the financial policy of Finance Minister Takahashi should not be changed. They said that although the financial policy of Finance Minister Takahashi was criticized at first, after a period of time, it has broken through the financial difficulties and led to today's financial stability. That is, the 시장(시장 - Korean word, likely a typo) and the currency, its stability is also rare in the past. It is absolutely impossible to change the policy and let the success of Takahashi's finance go to waste and fall into confusion. (3rd Dentsu Electric)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The financial community is deeply afraid that with the resignation en masse of the Saito Cabinet, the financial policy of Finance Minister Takahashi will be changed by the new cabinet. Governor of the Bank of Japan, 土方(土方), told reporters about this: The current state of the financial world is trending towards stability, and the currency policy is also close to equilibrium. This is the success of Takahashi's financial policy. If this stable state is changed by the new cabinet's policy, it will be very confusing. I don't want the new cabinet to adopt 급격(급격 - Korean word, likely a typo) changing policies. This is not my intention alone, but the intention of the entire Japanese financial community. In short, I hope that even if the cabinet changes, it will not adopt policies that change the keynote of this financial world. (3rd Dentsu Electric)</p>

<p>Relying on the whims of the military clique, creating a puppet state, issuing large amounts of public debt, preparing for a future war</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the May 15th Incident of 1932, in which members of the Japanese army, navy, and a suicide squad of farmers assassinated Prime Minister Inukai and plotted a fascist revolution, Japanese domestic politics were thrown into disarray. Viscount Saito, entrusted by elder statesmen and financial magnates, formed a cabinet on the 26th, bearing the following missions: (1) to suppress revolutionary movements from both the left and right wings; (2) to resolve the issue of military expansion and prepare for a major war; (3) to alleviate the poverty of farmers; and (4) to resolve the Manchurian policy. After assuming office, Prime Minister Saito devoted himself to resolving these four major issues. A brief account of the process is as follows: (1) In order to suppress domestic revolutionary movements, a special security force was established in the capital, wireless stations were set up in various prefectures, special agent teams were increased, remnants of the Communist Party were rounded up during emergencies, and the Godspeed Corps was captured to prevent the conspiracies of military cliques. Japanese nationals with military registration entering and leaving Manchuria were strictly investigated, even the wooden coffins of fallen Japanese soldiers were inspected. Fascists were expelled to Manchuria and China, with no effort spared. In May of this year, the president of the Privy Council was replaced, delivering a final blow to the fascists. This was the main effort to prevent revolution, providing Japanese financial groups with a prescription for prolonging their lives, but the results were not very effective. (2) After Saito came to power, the Second Naval Replenishment Plan was immediately decided, with an expenditure of 760 million yen. It was planned to build 24 warships over three years, and the air force was to be increased from 31 to 39 squadrons. The army decided to dispatch four more divisions to the four eastern provinces on a permanent basis, with half of the expenses borne by the puppet organization. The army also decided on a military supplies replenishment fee of 870,084,900 yen, to be fully replenished over five years. Thus, preliminary preparations for a major war were indeed ready. (3) The May 15th Incident was a coup d'état led by the military and involving farmers. Therefore, the cabinet and political parties had to find a way to resolve this problem. As a result, 700 million yen was spent over these three years to start projects in rural areas to help farmers. In reality, farmers benefited very little. Most of the funds went to financial capitalists and domestic manufacturers, and farmers remained poor. Araki, the Minister of the Army, who took it upon himself to save the farmers, also had to step down. The agricultural rescue policy was thwarted halfway. (4) The Manchurian policy was still wavering during the Seiyukai cabinet era, with the annexation policy or the establishment of a new protectorate still being debated. After Prime Minister Saito came to power, he immediately obeyed the military, recognized the Republic of Manchuria, and further created the Empire of Manchuria, implementing a protectorate policy, advocating an Asian Monroe Doctrine, and withdrawing from the League of Nations, seeking to dominate Asia.</p>
<p>In order to complete the above four major policies, Japan issued 2,481,850,000 yen in new public bonds during these three years. The domestic debt when Saito came to power (at the end of June 1932) was 4,986,000,000 yen, which had increased to 6,724,000,000 yen by April 1934, and reached 7,367,000,000 yen in March 1935. As for foreign debt, it exceeded 1,000,000,000 yen. This can also be said to be the achievements of the Saito cabinet in the past two years. (3rd United China Press)</p>

(2nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler's means of swiftly eliminating the violence in one or two days has become a matter of unanimous praise throughout Germany. For example, the Anglev Newspaper stated that the Prime Minister personally defended the country, exposing his personal body to great danger, such as personally leading several people into the nest of the conspirators and capturing the rebellious people alive. This cannot be done without both wisdom and courage. May I ask, in the revolutionary history of European countries, who has such courage? If such an incident occurs in a parliamentary country, it will only send police to surround it or dispatch troops to help it. The Berlin Daily stated that since the last turmoil occurred, the number of tourists on holidays has not decreased, and there has been no bank run or financial panic on Sunday. These are all phenomena that should have occurred after similar events under other countries or the previous German government, but now they are all missing. This is all due to the personal fortitude of Hitler and Goering, who can prevent problems before they happen and quickly restore the people's peace. (2nd National Telegram)</p>

Unofficial observers are planning to estimate the number of people who were shot or forced to commit suicide after participating in the failed revolution. This morning, the Associated Press reporter learned from the party headquarters, the government, and private sources that the number of victims nationwide was no more than fifty.

The driver waited in the car, and another person jumped out of the car and went straight into the villa. At that time, Schleicher and his wife were in the living room. When they heard several rings of the bell, an unknown person ran out of the villa and hurriedly got into the car and left. This process took a very short time. Schleicher died immediately, and his wife was seriously injured in the abdomen and died on the way to the hospital.

<p>French Newspaper Says National Socialism Swept Away</p>
<p>(Washington) The Baltimore Sun, in its commentary on the German situation, stated that Hitler's purge of party members was likely due to the discovery of some conspiracy. However, considering various circumstances, this event seems to be a sign of rebellion starting among a disillusioned and deceived people. The execution of former Chancellor Schleicher and other National Socialist leaders without trial shows the extreme danger of the situation. The National Socialist authorities believe that only terror can save their position, as fair trials and subsequent executions would not be as direct as summary killings. Aviation Minister Göring declared that the second revolution had ended, but in reality, the second revolution is just beginning. The Washington Post stated that Hitler and Göring intend to show their power, but the result will only expose the corruption of the National Socialist Party. The National Socialist Party is already completely bankrupt in politics and economics, and now, with the exposure of the scandals of its members, what future can it have? The Roman Emperor Nero was a notorious tyrant in history, but Hitler, after seventeen months in power, has failed in everything and is so ruthless in taking lives that we now see Nero's government as enlightened and happy. Hitler originally took it upon himself to liberate Germany, but since taking power, the German people have become slaves. Hitler's actions are such that even the rulers of invading countries would not dare to inflict them on conquered foreign peoples," and so on. (Havas dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspaper "Le Temps", in its commentary on the German situation, stated that as far as we know, Hitler, seeing the financial bankruptcy and economic difficulties, and feeling the danger of a second revolution of a social nature brewing among the National Socialists, had no choice but to ally with the right wing to gain the support of the national defense forces. However, with the assistance of Göring and Goebbels, he reserved the right to initiate the suppression of dissent himself. Whether this speculation is correct remains to be seen. What we find most strange is Hitler's sacrifice of the Stormtroopers. The success of National Socialism depended entirely on the activities of the Stormtroopers. After taking power, the maintenance of his dictatorial power also relied solely on the Stormtroopers. The leaders who held key positions were close friends who had struggled alongside Hitler for many years. This time, Hitler exposed their scandals, publicly punished them, and showed no consideration. The promotion of National Socialism relied on Hitler and the leaders as its main driving force. Now that the leaders have lost their reputation, in the eyes of the world, the prestige of National Socialism will likely be swept away. In practical terms, whether Hitler can control the situation in the future will depend entirely on the national defense forces," and so on. (Havas dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Vienna: In the recent German events, many National Socialist leaders were summarily executed without trial. The Austrian newspapers unanimously consider this inhumane and view it as a criminal act that violates human rights and laws. For example, the "Neue Wiener Tagblatt" stated that the execution of Röhm and his accomplices is contrary to the legal concepts of civilized countries. Even in primitive, uncivilized peoples and extreme autocratic eras, such brutality is unheard of. In the era of the Russian Tsarist regime, known for its autocracy, even the most serious criminals had to be interrogated by a court before being punished. The events that occurred in Germany last week can only be compared to the Turkish emperors of previous centuries who slaughtered their ministers and Charlemagne who judged his rebellious warriors," and so on.</p>
<p>(Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) London newspapers continue to comment on the German political situation. The Times stated that in terms of the German government's methods regarding human life, Germany has returned to the Middle Ages, but in the next few years, we will have more reasons to worry for Germany than to worry about Germany," and so on. The criticisms in other newspapers mostly believe that German Chancellor Hitler has reached an understanding with the national defense forces to disband the Brownshirts. The Daily Express stated that Hitler will henceforth be a prisoner of the national defense forces, the police, and the Prussian aristocracy. The Daily Express's Paris dispatch stated that the execution of key members of the German Stormtroopers occurred shortly after Hitler's special envoy Ribbentrop visited France. Therefore, the recent events in Germany can also be said to be a consequence of Ribbentrop's visit to France. Ribbentrop had verbally promised French Foreign Minister Barthou that if France agreed to Germany's advance on rearmament, Hitler could disband the Stormtroopers. The news of this conversation in Paris was later leaked in Berlin, and the Stormtroop leaders decided to oppose the disbandment. However, secret detectives learned of their plot and reported it to the authorities. Thus, Hitler and General Göring took swift action to gain the upper hand," and so on.</p>

<p>Prague: A joint session of parliament was held, where Foreign Minister Beneš reported on the diplomatic situation, stating that since Doumergue formed a coalition cabinet, the French political situation has become increasingly stable, and the unity of the Little Entente countries has become increasingly consolidated. Beneš considers the Balkan Entente very important. He then recounted various international events that prepared for the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations. Beneš stated that if the Eastern European countries could sign mutual assistance treaties to prevent aggressor countries, we could reopen the Disarmament Conference to seek a new basis for a disarmament treaty and compromise with Germany. He then mentioned French Foreign Minister Barthou's visits to Romania and Yugoslavia, stating that France is well aware that the Little Entente countries represent a force whose desire to maintain peace is the same as that of France.

<p>Forced Opening of Ports May Lead to Bloodshed</p>
<p>San Francisco: The West Coast Transportation Industry Strike Mediation Committee, appointed by the President, today placed the responsibility for peace or war on both labor and management, asking both parties to voluntarily request arbitration and abide by the arbitrator's decision. The committee declared, "In the opinion of this committee, if both parties request arbitration and abide by its decision, all disputes can be resolved peacefully." The committee also proposed that if striking workers return to their jobs, the arbitrator will conduct mediation. Today, two thousand striking workers gathered at the seaside at 3 PM, which was the date set by the California Industrial Association for the forced opening of the ports. However, the association announced that it had to postpone the opening until tomorrow because it was not fully prepared. All of this indicates that if both labor and management refuse arbitration, bloodshed may occur due to the forced opening of the ports. However, government mediators are still asking both parties to voluntarily request arbitration before Thursday. The attitude taken by the mediators has been explicitly approved by Labor Secretary Perkins. (National Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Committee for the Study of the Manufacture and Trade of Arms of the Disarmament Conference held a plenary meeting today to discuss the draft of the arms trade ban prepared by the Subcommittee on Arms Manufacture. (Note: The Committee for the Manufacture and Trade of Arms held a meeting on June 27, see the Geneva dispatch of that day for details.) The French representative explained that there are various difficulties in banning arms manufacture, such as the need for equal treatment between manufacturing and non-manufacturing countries, as well as between private and state-owned factories. The draft proposed by the subcommittee is sufficient to avoid various difficulties. He also explained the importance of realizing international supervision through public announcement. However, international supervision must take into account the special circumstances of arms manufacture and trade, so its implementation methods need to be carefully studied. The organization of supervision methods must also vary depending on the nature of the preparation. Some international supervision is carried out by supervising military expenditures, some by banning arms manufacture, and some by adopting other methods. Among these, it is necessary to seek mutual consideration. Representatives from the United Kingdom, Venezuela, Poland, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Spain all supported the subcommittee's draft, which was passed immediately without modification.

<p>Plans to Conduct Another Experiment in Late Summer</p>
<p>(Moscow) Scientists from the Soviet Union's Aviation and Chemical Defense Association today finalized plans to ascend to the stratosphere, a place above 25,000 meters where humans have never been. When the association first ascended last winter, the balloon was damaged, resulting in the death of three people. This time, they will conduct a detailed study to eliminate all shortcomings to prevent accidents. The date of the launch has not yet been decided, but it will likely take place in late summer, or it may be launched simultaneously with the balloon launch in the United States to compete. The purpose of this launch is to exceed the unofficial world record by 3,000 meters. The Soviet people are very interested in this launch and have contributed more than two hundred suggestions, some of the most valuable of which have been adopted.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Provincial Governments in Bandit Suppression Provinces to Implement Joint Office <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Reports to the Central Government</p>
<p>Vehemently Criticizes Current Administrative System's Common Problems</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang has formulated a general outline for joint office by provincial governments, which has been reported to the Central Political Council for record. It will be implemented first in the bandit suppression provinces of Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian. The full text of Chiang's report to the Central Political Council and the telegraphic dispatch to the Executive Yuan, along with the general outline for joint office by provincial governments, is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e88">Chiang's Telegraphic Dispatch <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang's report to the Central Political Council and telegraphic dispatch to the Executive Yuan stated: "The promulgation and implementation of the current provincial government organization law and county organization law have been in effect for several years. Although the provinces have formally completed their organization, in practice, there are many difficulties. They are like square pegs in round holes, completely incompatible. Therefore, reforming the local political system is a matter of urgency to refresh politics. The common problems of the current system can be summarized in three points: First, from the observation of the current system itself, it is top-heavy and lacks a solid foundation. In terms of organization, the province is large and the county is small. In terms of funding, the province is huge and the county is minuscule. There are too many agencies for governing officials and too few agencies for governing the people. There are too many high-ranking officials who do nothing and too few personnel who are deeply involved with the people. The greatest crux of the problem is that government orders become mere formalities. To compare the regular annual expenditure budgets for the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi in the 22nd year, the vast disparity between provincial and county administrative expenses is evident at a glance. Excluding the expenses of the Security Office, taking only the provincial government and the four departments as a standard, Henan has over 911,000 yuan, Hubei has over 1,119,000 yuan, Anhui has 1,010,000 yuan, and Jiangxi has over 813,000 yuan. The county administrative expenses in each of these provinces are: Henan, with 111 counties, has a total of over 1,091,000 yuan, averaging over 9,830 yuan per county; Hubei, with 70 counties, has a total of over 880,000 yuan, averaging over 12,600 yuan per county; Anhui, with 61 counties, has a total of over 957,000 yuan, averaging over 15,700 yuan per county; Jiangxi, with 81 counties, has a total of over 1,132,000 yuan, averaging over 13,800 yuan per county. Therefore, Anhui has the most county administrative expenses, followed by Jiangxi, then Hubei, and Henan has the least. However, in any province, the average monthly expenditure per county is only about one thousand yuan. The county is the mainstay of all government orders, and its importance is such, but the meager administrative expenses are as described above. There is no way to strengthen the organization, employ talent, or provide assistance. All efforts are abandoned, and this is naturally the case. Therefore, to reform the shortcomings of this top-heavy situation, the first step is to reduce the size of the provincial government's organization, expand the county government's organization, cut out the surplus of the provincial government, and transfer it to increase the county government's funding. Only by properly measuring the remedy can we promote benefits to the fullest extent. Second, from a horizontal perspective, the various departments and offices stand side by side, each forming its own system, each固守 its own scope, and each privatizing its own resources. Any matter under the jurisdiction of Department A is generally disliked by Department B. Matters involving two or more departments are often delayed and unresolved. They compete for power and shirk responsibility. Moreover, many measures are taken from the perspective of the respective department, lacking the spirit of suppressing oneself and promoting others to jointly maintain the overall situation. Thus, each recognizes the matters under its jurisdiction as the most urgent current affairs, and simultaneously supervises the county. The county magistrate does not know what to prioritize, and cannot do everything at the same time. As a result, the cunning ones specialize in perfunctory work, and the most unscrupulous ones borrow A to抵押 B, arbitrarily manipulating things to suit their own private plans. Those who are virtuous and cherish themselves suffer deeply from the disunity of government orders, are exhausted, and are uneasy in their positions. This kind of畸形 system is truly the厉阶 to the corruption of officialdom. Therefore, to eliminate the current stagnation, contradictions, duplication, segregation, and推諉 of provincial affairs, it is necessary to break the parallel situation of the various departments and merge them into a single, integrated provincial government. This will achieve the effect of uniformity, simplicity, harmony, and cooperation. Third, from a vertical perspective, the provincial government and its various departments and offices, and the county government and its various bureaus and sections, each form two distinct levels. The central ministries often recognize the provincial departments and offices as their directly subordinate agencies, and the provincial departments and offices also recognize the county bureaus and sections as their directly subordinate agencies. They directly communicate with each other in writing. The abuses resulting from this are that the provincial and county governments cannot exercise control at each level, and lose the effect of the body using its arms and the arms using its fingers. The regulations that the chairman represents the provincial government, supervises the execution of provincial affairs by subordinates, and that the county magistrate is in charge of the county's administration are mere words. The system is unclear and the levels are chaotic. How can we command subordinates and hold them accountable? Therefore, to eliminate this abuse, the entire provincial government must be absolutely responsible to the central ministries, and the entire county government must be absolutely responsible to the provincial government. The provincial departments and offices and the county bureaus and sections are auxiliary organizations of the province and the county and cannot be separated into two. All斜枝旁出的 writing methods should be resolutely abolished. In summary, the shortcomings of the current provincial system and the abuses arising from it are well known to those who understand the political situation today. They should be corrected and have become a unanimous request from above and below. However, a fundamental reform involves many things. If the central government considers only the current situation and changes the弦, it is deeply feared that there will be unforeseen consequences. There are two points that should be paid particular attention to. First, the various failures of the current provincial system are undeniable. In the future, the will of the provincial government should be unified, power should be concentrated, the organization should be tightened, and expenses should be saved. This is what the more knowledgeable people recognize. However, what is the appropriate degree of unification, concentration, tightening, and saving, and in what way should it be promoted? It is necessary to consider carefully and test it step by step. Second, the provinces of the country are vast and the relations are complex. The various situations of politics, culture, economy, and topography are not uniform. It is feared that it will be difficult to implement a uniform political system at the same time. For example, the设置 of four departments and two offices is considered too large in remote provinces and cannot be handled by manpower or financial resources. In the southeastern provinces, it is considered too simple and cannot meet the actual requirements without the addition of other specialized technical organizations. Even in terms of official ranks and salaries, the statutory salaries of the simplified任任 and appointed任任 are barely enough to maintain a livelihood in the southeastern provinces. If the定額 is paid in remote provinces, the entire department's expenses may only be enough to cover the salary of the主管長官. All these things are extremely disparate. The central system must be adapted to local conditions and considered over the long term. It seems that it is best to have a flexible and scalable local test. In recent years, Zhongzheng奉命 has supervised the troops and suppressed bandits. The more I have seen and heard, the more I have felt. I deeply believe that in order to promote local government affairs smoothly, especially the aftermath of bandit suppression in various provinces, it is necessary to unify the will of the provincial government and improve the efficiency of general administration. However, this kind of reform can only be carried out within the scope of not abandoning the current provincial government organization law and not affecting the budget of the provinces. Based on this principle, I have repeatedly discussed with the governments of the provinces for a year. Now, I have compiled the opinions of all parties and formulated a general outline of fourteen articles for the joint office of provincial governments. I have ordered the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian in the bandit suppression area to implement them as a test for the Central Government to thoroughly reform the local political system. In addition to分令, I have (correspondingly) enclosed the general outline for the review of the 钧会 and the checking of the 贵院, and I pray that it will be transferred (陈) to the National Government for record and implementation. This is a matter of public convenience."</p>
<h3 id="e89">Outline of Measures <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The full text of the Provincial Government Joint Office Measures Outline is as follows: Article 1: Before the Central Government revises the current Provincial Government Organization Law, in order to strive for the advancement of local political affairs, maintain the unity of the provincial government's will, and improve the efficiency of general administration, this outline is specially formulated to implement the Provincial Government Joint Office Measures. All of the following departments shall be incorporated into the Provincial Government Office: 1. Secretariat, 2. Department of Civil Affairs, 3. Department of Finance, 4. Department of Construction, 5. Department of Education, 6. Security Department. Article 2: If the current Provincial Government Office does not have sufficient space to accommodate all subordinate departments, it should be incorporated as much as possible within the possible range, at least first incorporate the Department of Civil Affairs and the Security Department. The rest will be added successively after the government office is rebuilt and expanded. Regardless of whether it has been incorporated or not, the office procedures shall be handled in accordance with this outline. Article 3: In addition to the departments listed in Article 1, all current institutions directly under the provincial government should be abolished or reduced in size and transferred to the competent departments. If the aforementioned institutions are temporary organizations for the implementation of special key policies, their powers should be enhanced and treated as departments, and it would be more convenient to be directly under the jurisdiction of the provincial government, they may not be transferred for the time being, but should still be subject to the guidance of the competent departments. Article 4: After the provincial government's joint office, all documents shall be received and dispatched by the provincial government secretariat, and undertaken by the competent departments, and the chairman shall review and approve them with separate or joint countersignatures. However, the competent departments, in accordance with their powers, supervise and direct the affairs of their subordinate staff or agencies, and may still issue department orders or office orders within the scope of not conflicting with provincial orders. Article 5: After the provincial government's joint office, all departments under the provincial government shall not directly exchange documents with the central ministries and departments, or with the commissioners, county magistrates or mayors and their subordinate sections or bureaus, but shall act in the name of the provincial government. Article 6: After the provincial government's joint office, if the orders or punishments proposed by the departments have been issued in the name of the provincial government after being approved by the chairman, and it is discovered that they violate laws and regulations, exceed authority, or are otherwise inappropriate, they may be revised by themselves and suspended or revoked separately upon the proposal of the following and after the deliberation of the provincial government committee: 1. Proposed by the chairman of the provincial government, 2. Proposed by the director of the competent department, 3. Proposed by other department heads or committee members. Article 7: After the provincial government's joint office, thorough reforms should be carried out in accordance with the following principles: 1. The organization of each department and its subordinate agencies, as well as the responsibilities of each section and group, should be re-determined according to the actual needs, and abolitions and mergers should be strictly implemented to ensure a clear system, specialized powers and responsibilities, reduced staff, and intensive work. 2. The expenses of the provincial government and its departments should be centrally managed, but if it is temporarily inconvenient to completely centralize the accounting of money or goods, the scope of items should also be determined to centralize part or most of them first. 3. The documents of the provincial government and its departments should adopt scientific management methods to ensure speed, prudence and simplicity. The receipt, dispatch and undertaking of documents every day and every week should be classified and abstracted into lists and sent to the department heads and the chairman for review. However, this does not apply to particularly confidential matters that should not be announced temporarily, and the chairman and the competent departments should be solely responsible. Article 8: After the reorganization of the provincial government secretariat after the provincial government's joint office, in addition to abolishing the existing organization according to the provisions of the preceding article, and setting up sections to take charge of documents, accounting, general affairs, etc., the following offices may be established as appropriate, and personnel with special expertise should be used to form them: 1. Technology Office: For agricultural, industrial, commercial, mining, water conservancy, civil engineering and other projects that the province should urgently handle now, appropriate technical experts should be employed according to their types to be responsible for investigation and design. The technical matters proposed by the competent departments should also be submitted to them for review, and they should be responsible for guidance and supervision. 2. Legal System Office: For the laws and regulations proposed to be issued by the provincial government or its departments and the revision and abolition of current laws and regulations, those with special expertise should be employed and concentrated in the Legal System Office to be responsible for investigation, drafting and review. 3. Statistics Office: Establish statistical specialists. All materials that should be collected by various agencies shall be submitted to the Statistics Office to compile various statistical reports in accordance with uniform regulations. 4. Gazette Office: Establish translation and printing specialists. All periodic or irregular publications issued by various agencies shall be uniformly handled by the Gazette Office. All laws and regulations shall be announced daily in the gazette to save the trouble of writing and sending them. Article 9: After the thorough reform of the organization and staff of the provincial government and its departments, all the remaining expenses should be allocated to increase the county government expenses. The laid-off personnel should be re-identified, and their talents should be measured and allowed to be selected separately for the use of county magistrates, district chiefs and other county auxiliary officials. Article 10: The implementing rules of this outline shall be determined by the provincial governments of each province themselves. Article 11: This outline shall be reported to the Central Political Conference by the General Headquarters for review and record. It shall be implemented first in the bandit suppression provinces of Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian. Other provinces may also be approved to use it by analogy after submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval. Article 12: After this outline is implemented in various provinces, the results of on-site trials should be compared in detail and reported to the central government at any time to prepare for the formulation of the provincial system and the implementation of the revised Provincial Government Organization Law for reference. Article 13: Matters not stipulated in this outline shall still be handled in accordance with the current Provincial Government Organization Law and other relevant laws and regulations. Article 14: This outline shall be implemented uniformly in all bandit suppression provinces within two months from the date of promulgation.</p>

<p>Expand the Organization of the National Defense Construction Committee</p>
<p>Guangdong and Guangxi Share the Cost of Building the Sanhe Road</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, June 25th: Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Chen Jitang visited He Jian at Tuisi Garden to discuss the national defense, bandit suppression, and transportation issues of the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan. The main points of their discussion are said to be: (1) The authorities of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces should eliminate the remaining bandits on the border of Hunan and Guangdong in a short period of time, and increase troops to jointly suppress the communist bandits in Jiangxi Province. (2) Actively open up the connecting lines of the three-province highways to facilitate the transportation of industry, commerce, and bandit suppression military affairs in the three provinces. (3) Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan will meet to deploy defense matters. (4) It is proposed to send personnel at any time, regardless of administrative divisions, to contact, inspect, study, and develop politics, security, economy, and industry. The results of the discussion were quite satisfactory, and it did not end until after 11 o'clock. It is also said that the Southwest National Defense Construction Committee intends to expand into a joint organization of five provinces. In addition to Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan, Guizhou and Fujian will be added. The regulations have been drafted by the Southwest Political Affairs Council. The number of members of the committee is tentatively set at nine, with the highest military and political leaders of each province as ex officio members. At present, the point that Guangxi Province pays the most attention to is the connection of the highway lines of the southwest provinces. The Guizhou-Guangxi Highway has already been completed. A few days ago, Li Zongren of Guangxi Province suggested at the Southwest Political Affairs Council that the Sanhe Railway from Sanshui County, Guangdong to He County, Guangxi should be built. The section of the road starts from Hekou in Sanshui, passes through Sihui, Guangning, Huaiji, and ends in He County, with a total length of more than 280 li. The survey has been completed. Bai Chongxi came to Guangdong this time to strongly promote its completion. He has repeatedly negotiated with Chen Jitang and Lin Yunying. As a result, the method of raising funds for road construction will be jointly borne by the Guangdong and Guangxi governments. The outline has been finalized. In the future, freight and passenger car fees will be levied, and surplus car profits will be allocated and stored as road construction funds, which will be separately repaid to the Guangdong and Guangxi governments. In addition, in order to connect the Hunan Province highway, Guangxi Province sent Li Fuguo, the section chief of the Guangxi Road Bureau, to Hunan a month ago to investigate Hunan's road administration and negotiate the issue of building a connecting line. It is planned to connect the Huangsha River to the border road line in northern Guangxi with the Hengyong Highway in Hunan Province. Moreover, since the Guangxi-Guizhou highway has already been connected, and the Guangxi-Yunnan highway has also been built in sections, it is planned to be completed in the 23rd year. However, the highways of Guangxi and Hunan provinces have not yet been connected. Once it is successful, the transportation of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces can rely on the Hengyong line in Hunan Province to reach the Yangtze River. Hengyong and other places will become the transportation hub of the southwest. Moreover, the Hengyong route is only more than 200 li to the Guangxi border, and the cost is not very high. After consideration, the Hunan authorities believe that it is feasible and agreed to send personnel to work with the Guangxi Road Bureau to build the Hunan-Guangxi highway in a short period of time, implement connection and joint transportation (June 28).</p>
<h3 id="e91">Remnant Bandit Internal Strife: Luo Binghui Executed by Firing Squad <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Luo Bandit Arrested on Suspicion of Social Democratic Party</p>
<p>All Bandits Panic and Gradually Disperse</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: According to information from relevant sources, Gu Zheng, a refugee who fled from Ruijin yesterday, claimed that: (1) Luo Bandit Binghui, the commander of the pseudo-Fujian bandit area, was arrested and interrogated on suspicion of being a member of the so-called Social Democratic Party. It was believed that Luo Bandit indeed had reactionary behavior. He has been executed by firing squad by the pseudo-central government. Luo Bandit's department was panicked and surrendered to the National Army one after another. Other bandit departments also felt that their lips would be cold if their teeth were lost. They were suspicious of each other and gradually dispersed. (2) Bandit leader Zhu De is currently stationed in Changting, Fujian, etc. Also, the 35th Brigade of the 12th Division of the National Army dispatched a team to attack the bandits at Shuangxikou, Shangrao at 8:00 am on the 24th of last month. There were two or three hundred bandits in the area, and hundreds more were added at 10:00 am. They fought fiercely with the attacking troops of the National Army. Finally, the officers and soldiers fought bravely and defeated the bandits at 12:00 pm and occupied the high ground behind Shuangxikou. At 4:00 pm, the brigade dispatched infantry and artillery to attack Matoushan with the purpose of destroying the bandits in Qingshuitang. There were about one hundred bandits, and they fought hand-to-hand five times before and after. At 7:00 pm that day, the National Army occupied the mountain and took advantage of the situation to attack the Qingshuitang fortifications. The bandits still held their ground and tried to make a final struggle. They were finally broken through the deer fence by the officers and soldiers in the dark and completely occupied at 9:00 pm. A total of more than one hundred bandits were killed in the three attacks before and after that day, and many guns and weapons were seized. (July 2)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Gu Mengyu Issues Statement After Impeachment (Part 2) <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>(2) Regarding the original impeachment that should be defended</p>
<p>1. The original text stated that the Zhengtai Railway originally borrowed 40 million French francs, with a term of 30 years, and the principal and interest were repaid on schedule. It was repaid in full on March 1, 1932. The contract should be terminated and recovered for self-management according to the contract. However, Gu Mengyu delayed the acceptance and secretly continued to conduct material borrowing with the French representative Mardin (that is, the French side purchased materials on behalf of the borrower and settled accounts as cash, which would be repaid in installments, with half a year as one term and ten terms). When Mardin returned to France, he ordered material loans from Parisian electrical manufacturers, totaling 90 million French francs, for the purpose of expanding and repairing the Datong Road, which were divided into three batches for payment, with 50 million French francs as one batch, 25 million French francs as one batch, and 15 million French francs as one batch. A contract was signed for each batch, and on July 1, 1933, Gu Mengyu sent a representative to sign and establish it with the representative of the Parisian Electrical Factory, which caused the Zhengtai Railway to be formally recovered after a delay of one year. Fearing foreign criticism, the material loan contract was falsely called a material purchase contract. (It is said that several batches of the materials have arrived and are used by the western section of the Longhai Road and the Datong Road.) It was found that this material loan was secured by the income of the Zhengtai Railway, which had just been taken over, and the Chinese transportation and other Chinese merchant banking groups were also used as guarantees. In addition, the French Vinot was reappointed as the director of the Zhengtai Road Vehicle Department, and the French Bo Yan was appointed as the chief auditor of the Zhengtai Road and the chief engineer of the Datong Road. The Jiaotong and other banking groups also sent Wang Yizeng, the president of the Shijiazhuang Bank of Communications, as the road supervisor due to debt relations. The Zhengtai Road was nominally taken over, but the power was still in the hands of the French, and all the income was used as an unrestricted guarantee, and the conditions were particularly harsh. This is what the minister did for borrowing foreign loans regardless of the interests and losing national sovereignty, and he should be subject to disciplinary action. In addition to the points in the original text that are inconsistent with the facts, which have been reviewed and corrected by the supervisory committee member Yang Tianji and others, the statement that "the contract should be terminated, the contract should be terminated, the contract should be terminated, and the contract should be terminated. Such ignorant and speculative remarks came from the impeachment chapter of the Supervisory Committee member, which is really unfortunate. According to Article 5 of the Zhengtai Railway Loan Contract concluded with the Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank on October 15, 1902 (ie, September 14, Guangxu 28 of the former Qing Dynasty), the Ministry planned to hold the reception of the Zhengtai Railway on March 1, 1932, when the loan was repaid. However, the representative of the French Parisian Bank (the creditor's rights of the road were transferred from the Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank to the French Bank) and the French Embassy raised objections one after another, and the reasons they held were: (1) It is stated in Section 1 of Article 5 of the signed driving contract that it is valid for 30 years from the date of signing, and must be returned no earlier than October 15, 1932. (2) Since the European War, the Chinese government has repaid the 5% gold loan in 1902, all in paper francs, which is inconsistent with the regulations of the loan driving contract. According to the provisions on the borrowed ticket, it is required to repay in gold francs, but my country only paid paper francs. The 5% loan matter was not concluded until March 1, 1932, and so on, stating that they refused to transfer the road. After many negotiations, there was still no effect. At that time, the January 28th Incident occurred in Shanghai, and the diplomacy was urgent. This matter was related to the current situation, and the measures had to be taken carefully. Therefore, the proceedings were slightly delayed, and it was changed to a forcible takeover in mid-October. However, the French side has not yet recognized it. The situation of the takeover is not as the supervisory committee member said, it is only "a formal recovery", and "the power of Zhengtai is still in the hands of the French". There are not only many precedents for new-style industries in our country to employ foreign personnel, but also profitable and harmless. It has been 30 years since the Zhengtai Road was founded. The scale is strict, the management is perfect, and the income is complete. The expenditure is saved. Therefore, the principal and interest of the loan have been repaid on schedule. The reputation of the road is good, and the road letter is also high. A narrow-gauge railway of more than 200 kilometers has such achievements, and it can be called a model of Chinese railways. It is no shame. However, to promote its cause, most of it has to be attributed to the French personnel serving on the road. Not only are their achievements on the road excellent, but it is also appropriate to continue to appoint them after the takeover, so as to take advantage of the familiarity with the job. That is, considering their previous hard work, it is also appropriate to record and show that the Republic of China gives preferential awards to guest officials who are loyal to their duties. It is not appropriate to dismiss all of them on the day of recovery. This is the reason why the Ministry retained a part of the original French personnel after taking over the Zhengtai Road. As for the so-called "the power is still in the hands of the French", it is even more unknown what it is based on. The French personnel are all appointed by the Ministry of Railways. People have special duties, and duties have special responsibilities. They are bound by the regulations of the Ministry and listen to the command of the Bureau Director. At the end of each year, the Ministry awards and punishes them according to their achievements. If it is still said that "the power is in the hands of the French,"</p>
<p>Then, according to the supervisory committee member's intention, all foreign personnel in the central and local agencies must be dismissed. The original text also said that "all the income is used as an unrestricted guarantee, and the conditions are particularly harsh". It was found that the total value of the material purchase contract was 50 million French francs, equivalent to 10 million national currency, while the Zhengtai Railway's annual surplus was less than 2 million yuan, and other payments had to be deducted, and the net surplus was only more than 1 million yuan. If the entire amount is not used as a guarantee, according to the supervisory committee member's intention, how many parts should be used as a guarantee? It is "harsh" to use an income of more than 1 million yuan as a guarantee for 10 million yuan. According to the supervisory committee member's intention, what conditions are not harsh? This is what I would like the supervisory committee member to clarify and provide a solution.</p>
<p>2. The original text stated that the amount of this material loan reached 90 million French francs. Since it was named after the expansion and repair of the Datong Road, and it was known to be uneconomical construction funds, and harsh conditions that damage national sovereignty, it was impossible to obtain the consent of the Central Political Conference and the legislative body. Therefore, on the surface, it was called a material purchase loan, and contracts were signed in batches to reduce the amount, hoping to deceive the people and avoid the statutory procedures of submitting it to the Central Political Conference for approval and handing it over to the Legislative Yuan for review in accordance with the law. This is what the minister did to avoid the exercise of the powers of the Central Political Conference and the legislative body in violation of national law, and he should be subject to disciplinary action. The purchase of materials is different from borrowing money. The contract is a material purchase contract and cannot be forcibly called a loan contract. This level has been stated in the reply report of the supervisory committee members Yang Tianji and others, and will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>3. The original text stated that the so-called Datong Line has been under construction for nearly a year, only from Yuci, following the old Tongcheng Line to 35 kilometers between Taigu, the original earthwork, is being repaired, and the track is only five or six kilometers long (the track gauge is four feet and eight and a half inches, which is different from the Zhengtai Road track gauge of one meter. The Tongpu Road built by the Shanxi Ordnance Industry also starts from Taiyuan and passes through Yuci, Taigu, and ends in Jiexiu. The Zhengtai Road between Taiyuan and Yuci and the Datong Road between Yuci and Taigu face each other far away and become parallel lines with the closest distance. At this time, when the state-owned railways are in urgent need of expansion, about the important domestic transportation, there is more than just this road that urgently needs to be built. The minister borrowed huge amounts of foreign capital, but only for the construction of this parallel road line, first delaying the urgent and emphasizing the light, ignoring the overall situation, and acting inconsistently. Moreover, during the current construction period, he is wasting time and salaries. In the future, even if the road line is fortunately completed, it will lead to business competition due to the two parallel lines, and the result will be two failures. This is what the minister did to intentionally damage the interests of the country due to improper measures and should be subject to disciplinary action. It was found that most of the materials purchased this time were used on the Tongxi Line, not on the Datong Line. The review report of the supervisory committee members Yang Tianji and others has also stated this, and will not be repeated here. However, the statement that the Datong Line built by the Ministry and the Tongpu Line built by the Shanxi Provincial Ordnance Industry have become parallel lines, and the situation of their passage has to be slightly stated. The Tongpu Line from Datong to Puzhou in Shanxi, that is, the Datong Line from Datong to Tongguan, which the Ministry later called, is a trunk line running north and south in Shanxi, connecting the Longhai Line in the south and entering the PingSui Line in the north, and is also the main trunk line running north and south in the national railway network. According to the Ministry of Railways, a standard gauge should be built so that it can be connected to the national trunk lines and become a part of the national road network. In the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, because the loan was hopeful, in order to promote early success, the Datong Road Engineering Office was organized in February of the 22nd year to start construction, and ordered the Zhengtai Road Bureau member to handle it concurrently, and directly subordinate to the Bureau to save expenses. However, before long, the Shanxi Provincial authorities also started construction of the narrow-gauge Tongpu Railway. The plan was not approved by the Ministry of Railways in advance. However, Director Yan telegraphed Yu when the Datong Road was just starting construction, briefly describing the plan for the light railway and requesting to order the roads to transport materials free of charge. Yu Dang replied to Director Yan on March 15 as follows: "Taiyuan Director Yan Baichuan, the Yuandian is respectfully known. After receiving the Jiangdian about the road construction problem in Jin Province, I have been waiting for a detailed letter to rely on research. On the one hand, I will inform Minister Li of this method and entrust him to transfer it, and I hope to get your listening. The Datong Road from Datong to Tongguan is now being actively carried out in the Ministry and will start construction soon. If you are building a light railway, it should be outside the scope of that road. As for the cement used for the light railway, it has been ordered to be exempted from transportation fees. Brother Gu Mengyu." After that, Director Yan sent Mr. Cui Wenzheng to Beijing to explain the Shanxi Provincial Ordnance Industry Road Construction Plan to Mengyu, so he sent Jiangdian to Director Yan again on April 3 as follows: "Taiyuan Director Yan Baichuan, according to Mr. Cui Wenzheng's oral description of the plan of the Zunzong's Ordnance Industry Road Construction, it will first build the line from Yuci South. It was found that this line is parallel to the Datong Railway, and the transportation business in the future will inevitably compete with each other, which is actually detrimental to both roads. In my opinion, the construction of the light railway by the Zunzong should focus on the nutrition line of the state-owned trunk road. Since the Datong Road is the north-south line, the light railway should be the east-west line, such as the line from Pingyao to the west, the line across east and west from Lingshi, and the line from Qinghuazhen to the west into southern Jin. If they can be built one after another, they can cooperate with the state-owned trunk line and help each other. This is my humble opinion, and there may be some places that can be adopted. I hope you will cut it down for good fortune. Brother Gu Mengyu." Director Yan failed to follow the above opinion, and then the Ministry received a report from the Datong Road Engineering Office in May, saying (1) Director Yan started to build the Yuci-Xugou line, which is almost parallel to the Datong Line, on April 13 (2. The houses needed by the Datong Road Engineering Office for office and accommodation of staff and company members are now occupied by the army building the above-mentioned roadbed. After that, the difficulty of the Tian Tong Road Engineering Office increased day by day. After repeated consultations, Director Yan only agreed to dismantle the narrow-gauge Tongpu Road after the standard gauge Datong Road was completed, but stated that the Provincial Tongpu Road will continue as before before the Datong Road handled by the Ministry is completed. The Ministry saw that the technical and economic and other difficulties could not be solved, so it ordered the Datong Engineering Office to temporarily suspend work, and the materials originally ordered for the road were all transferred to other lines. The above is the process of the Datong Line being built and then stopped. The supervisory committee member Liu Houwu did not observe the situation and made arbitrary criticisms. It is true that he claimed to be "ignorant of the overall situation and acting inconsistently."</p>
<p>4. The supervisory committee member said, "Some commentators said that there are many shady scenes in this material purchase, and the sophistication of the profiteering and the amount of embezzlement are worse than the loan kickbacks in the Beijing government era. People are talking about it, and there is a reason for it." The committee member Liu Houwu is not only confused and does not observe the facts, but also creates such baseless rumors and uses the destruction of other people's reputation as his business. But if the country has a common law and society has good customs, this kind of rumors, once uttered from a private person's mouth, has constituted the crime of defamation. Today, with the dignity of the Supervisory Yuan, it exercises its powers, presents an impeachment chapter, and publishes it publicly, which is forbidden by the laws of civilized countries and not allowed by customs. I can't help but grieve for the future of the Supervisory System of our country. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e97">The Rich Resources of Ningxia in Water Conservancy, Agriculture, and Mining <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Helan Mountains in Ningxia stand tall, able to block cold air and drifting sands. The rivers are at a high elevation, providing irrigation benefits. The soil is fertile, and the products are abundant. It has naturally received unique advantages, and human construction continues to strive. The title of "Heavenly Prefecture on the Frontier" has been increasingly enhanced in its value. Now, according to Director Yu Jieyi of the Department of Construction, I will briefly discuss the water conservancy, agriculture, forestry, industry, commerce, and products of Ningxia Province, as follows:</p>
<p>Since the Han and Tang dynasties, Ningxia has opened canals to draw water and reclaimed land for colonization, transforming a barren land into a fertile area. However, the land contains alkali, making it suitable for irrigation but not for excessive rain. Excessive rain causes the alkali to rise to the surface, making the soil hard and poor, harming the crops. Irrigation, on the other hand, brings silt with the river water, suppressing the alkali. With the application of some fertilizer, the soil becomes fertile. In the eighteenth year of the Republic [1929], Shaanxi and Gansu suffered a drought, and starvation was widespread. Ningxia alone sang of abundance, which is the reason for this. There are ten major canals in the entire province: Hanyan Canal, opened during the Han dynasty, unknown year, 195 li long, passing through Ningxia and Shuofang counties, irrigating over 128,000 mu of land; Tanglai Canal, created in the Tang dynasty, 320 li long, passing through Ningxia, Shuofang, and Pingluo counties, irrigating over 179,000 mu of land; Huinong Canal, opened in the fourth year of the Yongzheng reign of the Qing dynasty, 262 li long, passing through Ningxia, Shuofang, and Pingluo counties, irrigating over 111,400 mu of land; Daqing Canal, opened in the forty-seventh year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing dynasty, 71 li long, passing through Ningxia, Shuofang, irrigating over 16,200 mu of land; Tianshui Canal, opened in the thirty-fourth year of the Guangxu reign [1908], 30 li long, passing through Ningxia, irrigating over 6,000 mu of land. The above five canals are located on the west bank of the Yellow River. Qin Canal, created in the Qin dynasty, 150 li long, passing through Lingwu County, irrigating over 700 mu of land; Han Canal, created in the Han dynasty, repaired in the Qing dynasty, 100 li long, passing through Jinji, irrigating 125,800 mu of land; Meili Canal, opened in the Renwu year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming dynasty [1522], passing through Zhongwei, 200 li long, irrigating over 45,000 mu of land; Qixing Canal, opened in the Ming dynasty, 140 li long, passing through Zhongning, irrigating over 27,800 mu of land; Changrun Canal, opened in the fourth year of the Yongzheng reign of the Qing dynasty, 130 li long, passing through Pingluo, irrigating over 1,690 mu of land. In total, about 711,000 mu of land are irrigated. Although Ningxia has a large amount of fertile land as mentioned above, the wilderness awaiting development is many times greater. Recently, the General Bureau of Land Reclamation has investigated and found over 870,000 mu of wasteland that is extremely suitable for reclamation and cultivation. The distribution areas are roughly as follows: (1) Dengkou County: This county, from Dengkou in the east, the Wula River in the west, the Helan Mountains in the south, and the Yellow River in the north, has an area of about 1,000 square li, totaling over 500,000 mu. It was formerly under the direct jurisdiction of the A-Jie-Shan Banner. Since the Gengzi Incident [Boxer Rebellion], the indemnity for the church has not been cleared, and it has been managed by foreigners. Canal opening and land reclamation have already yielded over 100,000 mu of good land. Each year, they only pay a rent of over 10,000 yuan to the A-clan prince's residence, while the income reaches about 400,000 yuan. The Gengzi indemnity for the church was only a few hundred yuan, and the treaty period expired in the nineteenth year of the Republic [1930]. Urgent negotiations should be conducted to recover it and renew the lease with the prince's residence. This would both recover rights and interests and increase income. In addition to the cultivated land irrigable by canals, the county still has over 300,000 mu of uncultivated wasteland. If canals and ditches are opened, it will immediately become fertile land. (2) Zhenshuo Fort in Pingluo County: This fort is located near the Zhannen Canal (a branch of the Tanglai Canal), east from Shuangdunzi, west to Chongkou Fort, south from the Erdao Canal (a small branch of the Zhannen Canal), and north to Guanhudun, with an area of about 400 square li. Approximately 200,000 mu of wasteland can be reclaimed. If the Zhannen Canal is extended further, passing through Zhenshuo Fort and entering the river at Shizuishan, about 200 li long, another 300,000 mu of wasteland can be reclaimed, totaling over 500,000 mu. (3) Hezhong Fort in Ningxia County: This fort is east from the Qin Canal, west to the Yellow River, about 15 li long, south from Xinjiabao, and north to the Yellow River, about 20 li long. Excluding the desert canals, buildings, and over 10,000 mu of cultivated land, about 700 mu of wasteland can still be reclaimed. In total, the reclaimable wasteland mentioned above amounts to 870,000 mu. Assuming that each person reclaims 20 mu of wasteland, 43,500 people can be accommodated. If all the land is successfully reclaimed, the annual public and private income, calculated at 6 yuan per mu, could reach over 5 million yuan. However, the cost of opening canals, building villages, purchasing farming tools, etc., during reclamation totals over 3.6 million yuan. This cannot be achieved without a comprehensive plan and concerted effort from the government and local authorities.</p>
<p>Ningxia's natural forests, located in the passes of the Helan Mountains, are estimated to have about 200,000 trees, Pingluo has 160,000 trees, and Ningxia has 100,000 trees. During the Qing dynasty, they were protected by the Green Standard Army. Since the Republic, felling has been arbitrary, and they have gradually become scarce. Artificial forests have not been established. In the eighteenth year of the Republic [1929], the construction of the province was reorganized, and the Department of Construction also managed rivers and water conservancy. It began to preserve and expand the trees on the canal dikes and established nurseries on the silted land along the rivers to promote afforestation. Since Director Yu took office, he has personally supervised the staff in the department and instructed all counties to plant trees uniformly during each Arbor Day. The Construction Bureau is strictly ordered to patrol each section. In recent years, the number of surviving trees has become increasingly impressive. The desolate situation of the past has gradually transformed into a lush scene.</p>
<p>The province has fertile land for thousands of miles, and its products are abundant. It is not only suitable for farming and grazing but also convenient for industry and commerce. Products such as salt, alkali, fur, saltpeter, licorice, and medicinal materials have large annual yields, making it a naturally endowed industrial zone. Cattle, sheep, camels, and horses thrive everywhere. Tan sheep fur is famous throughout the country. Wool carpets are also as renowned as the products from Baotou. However, the annual production of various animal skins is approximately 140,000 pieces. Apart from being used locally for making boxes, the majority, along with the annual production of over 1 million jin of camel and sheep wool, has always been transported by merchants to Tianjin, resold to foreign merchants, made into finished products, and then resold to China. The extent of this leakage is extreme. The Department of Construction initially established an industrial testing ground, and now it is being expanded to produce leather, boots, shoes, carpets, wool yarn, weaving, soap, dyeing, and other materials. Among these, leather boots and shoes are produced in increasing quantities, and sales are gradually expanding. The annual production of licorice is approximately 2 million jin, of which about 300,000 to 400,000 jin are sold to foreign countries (such as Japanese Jintan, tobacco, and Finnish and German medicinal uses). A Finnish merchant named Willio Voss invented a machine to boil it into paste locally and transport it to foreign countries, making huge profits. However, he stopped due to heavy taxes. Currently, there is still a merchant-run Yuning Licorice Company that boils it using machines, but foreign sales are not as smooth as before.</p>
<p>Mineral production is dominated by coal, while other mineral resources have not been explored. It is said that all kinds of metals are found in the territories of the Alxa and Ejina Mongol banners. However, due to the lack of guidance from specialized talent and the enterprise of capitalists, the resources are abandoned on the ground and cannot be exploited. Salt and alkali are natural crystals and are produced in abundance. The Huamachi, Huianchi, Gouchi, Lannichi, and Lianhuachi, etc., crystallize into salt once a year. The major salt lakes in the Mongolian areas of Alashan, Dingyuanying, Chaghan, Nalin, and Hamagatai Nuo, etc., are also naturally formed, only with larger grains and higher yields. The annual salt production in the above areas totals 200 to 300 million jin. Natural alkali lakes are even more numerous. The method of mining is only to send workers to the lake to dig it out in winter and spring. Each block weighs several hundred jin and is transported to the province and Shaanxi and Gansu. If new methods can be adopted to produce pure, slag-free alkali blocks, it is hoped that the import of foreign alkali can be resisted. Furthermore, using chemical methods to extract sodium carbonate and caustic soda can provide raw materials for the chemical industry. It is estimated that the three major alkali lakes in Etoke Banner (see previous grassland communications) can produce about 20 million jin of alkali annually. Baijinaer produces about 60,000 jin annually. Most of the rest crystallizes and dissolves on its own, and no one investigates. There are even cases where Mongolians consider them sacred lakes and do not allow mining.</p>
<p>Ningxia has four major specialties: some refer to lake salt, lake alkali, fur, and licorice, while others refer to Chinese wolfberry, licorice, Tan sheepskin, and chazi (coal slack). Although there are slight differences, each has its reasons. Salt and alkali are naturally abundant products, Chinese wolfberry and licorice are warm and nourishing medicines, Tan sheepskin has up to thirteen bends in its fur, and chazi is a type of coal that is very similar in nature to charcoal and is extremely easy to burn. If covered with ash, it will not go out for a long time. If buried in a pit in large chunks, it can stay hot for fifty to sixty days. However, it is best to avoid the initial fumes. In addition to the well-known Chinese wolfberry and licorice, medicinal materials also include astragalus, codonopsis pilosula, angelica sinensis, and musk, etc. Fruits include grapes, pears, peaches, dates, pomegranates, and walnuts, etc. Agricultural products include wheat, corn, sesame, peas, sorghum, and millet, all produced locally. Rice is produced in paddy fields and can be transported to the Long province [Gansu].</p>
<h3 id="e98">The National Economic Commission's Jiangxi Office is Working <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Carrying out Various Rural and Health Construction Projects</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The National Economic Commission has established an office in Jiangxi, which was officially established on May 23. The newly appointed director of the commission, Xiao Chunjin (formerly chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Economic Commission), has also reported to the National Economic Commission for duty and has begun construction according to the plans set by the Economic Commission. The progress of the project is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Agricultural Technology: Jiangxi's agricultural technology remains in the state of the Middle Ages. The institution responsible for improvement is the Agricultural College, which is divided into five departments: plant production, animal production, agricultural extension, rural economy, and rural education. All agricultural agencies in the province are under its command. The college site has been located near the Liantang Rural Normal School. The Economic Commission has allocated 200,000 yuan, and the Provincial Government has allocated 120,000 yuan for all equipment. It is currently under construction.</p>
<p>Agricultural Economy: Jiangxi's cooperative business has made rapid progress in recent years. More than 800 cooperatives of various types have been established. New ones are emerging like mushrooms. However, in the past, emphasis was placed on credit cooperation. The purpose of this office is to develop Jiangxi's production and increase exports. In the future, special attention will be paid to transportation cooperation. For example, the province's specialty products such as paper, ramie cloth, timber, and handicrafts such as porcelain will be organized for cooperative transportation and sales to facilitate the flow of goods, and the economy will naturally prosper. The Economic Commission has allocated 500,000 yuan as a cooperative fund to be lent to various societies to serve as capital.</p>
<p>Rural Service: The office has divided the province into ten areas as rural improvement experimental zones. It will temporarily concentrate its efforts on various businesses in Zhangshe, Shangdun, and the countryside of Nancheng, including cooperation, health, sideline occupations, and technological improvements. After success, it will be promoted and popularized. In the past, everything emphasized urban construction, resulting in distorted development. Ninety percent of the total financial revenue was taken from farmers, but not a penny was used for rural relief and construction. The future emphasis on rural construction will correct this shortcoming.</p>
<p>Health Construction: The Provincial Health Department has been established. Director Pan Ji has received 300,000 yuan in construction funds from the Economic Commission. First, a model provincial hospital will be built on the site behind the Gongyuan [Examination Hall]. The equipment fee is more than 300,000 yuan. In the future, it will be the only hospital in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. A health center has been established in Nanchang City to improve environmental hygiene.

<h3 id="e99">Fujian Province's Recovered Bandit Areas Establish Rural Villages <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Establishing Farmers' Banks to Lend Funds</p>
<p>The Headquarters Allocated 500,000 Yuan as a Fund</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The bandit areas of Fujian Province now only include Changting, Ninghua, Mingxi, and Qingliu counties. Jiang Dingwen, Commander-in-Chief of the East Route Army, has specially dispatched his plenipotentiary representative, Jiang Bocheng, to Guangdong to discuss joint suppression measures with Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the South Route Army. It has been decided that the remaining bandits in the Fujian-Jiangxi border area will be attacked simultaneously by the East, North, and South Route Armies. It is expected to be launched within a few days. Currently, the total number of Red bandits in Fujian and Jiangxi is more than 50,000, with about 20,000 in the four counties of Fujian Province and about 30,000 in the five counties of Jiangxi Province. They are extremely scattered internally. Once attacked by the three-route armies, it will not be difficult to wipe them out completely. Therefore, clearing the bandit atmosphere is no longer a problem. However, the fields and gardens in the recovered counties are desolate, the houses are in ruins, the people have fled, and the local area has been completely devastated. Without a comprehensive post-disaster solution, it will be impossible to restore social vitality. If the refugees are simply recruited back to their hometowns without planning for their livelihoods, it will be difficult to make them settle down. In response to the actual needs, the Provincial Government has specially organized a Rural Committee for the Restoration of Bandit-Affected Counties, headed by Li Zuyu, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Xu Fu, Director of the Department of Finance, and Chen Ticheng, Director of the Department of Construction, to be responsible for handling the matter. The method is to establish a Farmers' Bank in the provincial capital and offices in the bandit-affected counties. On the one hand, the county government orders all districts and villages to organize credit cooperatives. The cooperatives borrow funds from the bank offices to purchase agricultural tools and store them in the cooperatives. Any farmer who has returned to his hometown after fleeing and wants to cultivate the land but does not have agricultural tools or seeds can ask for a guarantor to purchase them on credit from the cooperative and repay them in installments after the harvest. This is the first step in restoring the countryside. However, the fund for this Farmers' Bank must be at least 500,000 yuan. However, after the counties have been successively recovered, it is necessary to establish county governments and to prepare for post-disaster relief. The need for funds is enormous. At this time when Fujian Province's finances are difficult, it is really difficult to raise this huge amount. Therefore, Director of Finance Xu Fu used the opportunity to attend the National Finance Conference to present the situation to the Central Government and the Nanchang Headquarters and requested assistance. Yesterday, the Provincial Government received a telegram from Xu Fu stating that the Headquarters had approved an allocation of 500,000 yuan as a fund for the Farmers' Bank, and the Ministry of Finance had also approved an additional 50,000 yuan per month to the original subsidy of 250,000 yuan for local post-disaster relief expenses. The authorities are quite satisfied with this. It is expected that the Farmers' Bank will be established after Xu Fu returns to Fujian. However, the refugees who have returned to their hometowns are in dire need of relief and cannot wait. The Restoration Committee has specially received 60,000 yuan from the Provincial Government to purchase 10,000 bags of rice in Shanghai and transport them to the bandit-affected areas for flat-price sales to provide emergency relief. At the same time, the committee will send personnel to various counties to investigate the local disaster situation in order to prepare for post-disaster relief. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Songjiang County Chamber of Commerce Requests Continued Dredging of the River <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce held a joint routine meeting of executive supervisors on the 3rd morning. Committee member Lu Shulian proposed that the dredging of the river in the urban area has been suspended, the riverbed has cracked, the food and drink are smelly, commercial transportation is blocked, and the epidemic is spreading. How can we take action to send a telegram to the provincial authorities to expedite the dredging and urgently plan preventive measures? The reason is briefly stated as follows: The dredging of the river in the urban area is urgently needed by all the citizens. However, it was suspended abruptly after starting work in the east outside the city. As a result, the riverbed is completely exposed in the area from the city center to Dama Road Bridge, and cracks have appeared, causing many obstacles. During this dredging, the construction methods and the progress of the project were all the responsibility of the county government. However, it was immediately suspended, although it was due to the attacks of some people. However, the focus of the dispute is on the poor methods, not on the suspension of dredging. How can we stop eating because of choking and make the city river, which the 80,000 people of Song have been expecting to be dredged, stop in anger and lead to a terrible state of drinking water for the whole city? I respectfully propose that this be discussed and decided by a public vote. Resolution: (A) To be in accordance with the current situation, (1) Send a telegram directly to the provincial authorities, (2) Send letters to the overseas hometown associations to ask for assistance, (3) Recommend Cheng Weiru, Lu Shulian, Zhu Yian, and Sun Shaochi to petition the county government, (B) To comply with the standards, (1) Add it to the current medical bureau and organize vaccinations for epidemic prevention in advance. The remaining cases are omitted.</p>

<p>Since the spring, the lantern festival has been enthusiastically held in the four rural villages of this county, with a sudden surge of activity. However, the Tinglin festival was stopped by the district chief notifying the local public security bureau, resulting in a conflict in which the lanterns of the late president's portrait and the national flag were destroyed. The fellow villagers in Beijing telegraphed the provincial authorities to thoroughly investigate. The provincial government ordered the county to investigate and report on the circumstances of the incident. After investigation, it was found that nothing of the sort had happened. After receiving the report, the provincial government instructed that the district chief, Zhang Baotai, be recorded with a demerit. However, the police officers in charge of the public security bureau are responsible for maintaining public order and failed to find a way to eliminate the problem, which cannot be excused. The county magistrate will deal with them separately. At the same time, in accordance with the order of the Department of Civil Affairs No. 5842, the allegations of police corruption made by Zhou Shizhen and others will be investigated in detail as soon as possible, and the director of the public security bureau will be supervised to rectify the situation and report it together for inspection and punishment.</p>

<p>The city has been hot and stuffy for a week. Yesterday (the 2nd), the indoor temperature was still above 103 degrees Fahrenheit. At about 7 p.m. in the southwest corner, dark clouds gathered, and lightning flashed. After half an hour, a strong wind suddenly arose, and the treetops danced, with the potential for thunderstorms. At 8:15, large raindrops began to fall, but after only two or three minutes, the rain suddenly stopped, the wind blew the clouds away, and the sky was full of twinkling stars. There was no sign of rain. The whole night was hot and stuffy, and the people were greatly disappointed. Today (the 3rd), the heat is even worse. If it does not rain again, the crops will be hopeless. The blind people in the county are extending monks at Huangbudun to recite scriptures and chant prayers for rain. The Red Swastika Society has been reciting Buddhist scriptures for ten days. Shen Bo'an, a fortune teller in Jiangyin Lane, is also extending Taoists and Buddhist nuns at home to recite scriptures and pray for rain, and he has also made a grass dragon and hired people to pick it up and walk around praying for rain. Farmers in the countryside are praying for rain on the dry riverbeds. The county magistrate originally intended to stop slaughtering animals immediately, but he has delayed implementation due to the slaughter tax. A large turtle in the gutter of the house of the township chief of Houqiao Township made a strange cry. A large turtle in the well of a certain family in Anzhen wanted to get out of the well. The villagers said that this was a sign of a great drought. The number of people suffering from heatstroke has been increasing in recent days, and the hospitals are extremely busy. Xing Yuantang, a prison guard in the county, in order to appease the prisoners, specially submitted a list of 50 people, including Chen Rongsheng, who met the bail regulations to the county for review so that bail procedures could be processed as soon as possible. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu has also scheduled a meeting to discuss the rice price issue. Qian Sunqing, director of the County Financial Property Office, requested the opening of the Lugang River. Epidemics are very prevalent in urban and rural areas, especially in rural areas, which are the most miserable, without doctors or medicine, which is quite pitiful.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Various Industries Call for Relief After the Implementation of New Import Tariffs <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Lower New Taxes Create Dumping Opportunities for Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Unable to Compete, Request Reversal of Order</p>
<p>The new customs import tariffs have been announced by the Jianghai Customs Supervision Office and the Tax Department, and have been implemented since yesterday. These new taxes slightly reduce tariffs on cotton cloth, paper, seafood, etc. Various industries held meetings to request the government to reverse the order in order to maintain domestic industries and avoid the dumping of foreign goods. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency specially visited the paper industry and cotton textile leaders, Jin Runyang, Zhu Wenqi, etc., yesterday to record the details as follows.</p>
<p>Paper Industry: Most paper imports come from Japan. Since the founding of the Republic, imports have increased year by year. In 1928, imports were 2,030,968 dan. In 1929, imports were 2,299,735 dan. In the first half of 1932, during the period when Chinese people boycotted Japanese goods, imports were 230,252 dan. Since the increase in tariffs from May of last year, domestic paper mills have been vigorously expanding, competing with Japanese paper, relying on the government's protection and increased customs duties. For example, Minfeng, Shanghai Longzhang, and other factories have been purchasing machines for making Daolin paper. Since the new taxes were announced yesterday, the import tax on foreign paper has been reduced by approximately 30%. All paper mills have been alarmed. The Chinese Paper Mills Association, in view of the reduction in import taxes on foreign paper, for example, Lian Shi yellow-edged paper, both Japanese and domestic products, cost approximately 42 yuan per ream. However, domestic goods cannot make a profit due to competition with Japanese goods. Now, if the tax on foreign paper is reduced, Japanese paper can be reduced by 5 jiao per ream, while domestic paper will inevitably lose 5 jiao. If this continues, domestic paper mills will not be able to maintain production, and Japanese paper dumping will become more severe. Therefore, an emergency meeting was held at 11:00 AM yesterday to resolve to petition the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry, requesting the reversal of the order to reduce import taxes on foreign paper.</p>
<p>Cotton Textile Industry: Annual imports of cotton textiles, for example, in the first half of 1933, were 3,487 from Japan and 19,555 from Hong Kong. Most of the imports from Hong Kong are Japanese goods because Chinese people were severely boycotting Japanese goods at the time, so goods were rerouted through Hong Kong. Japanese cotton textile goods are dumped in various parts of our country. When Chinese-owned yarn mills and cotton textile industries heard that the import tax was being amended, they sent representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Finance and other departments, requesting that it not be reduced. Since the new taxes were announced yesterday, the Cotton Textile Industry Association has been studying and comparing the new and old tariffs and will decide on a plan. However, the fabric mill parts of Chinese-owned yarn mills, such as Shenxin No. 1 Mill, Wing On Yarn Mill, Dafeng Yarn Mill, Hongzhang Yarn Mill, Hengfeng Yarn Mill, etc., have reduced labor and opened regular day shifts, taking turns to work with the original workers, due to the dumping of Japanese cloth and low market prices. Now that the import tax has been reduced, Japanese goods dumping will inevitably become more severe, and prices can be further reduced. Domestic cotton cloth will not be able to compete with them. Moreover, the raw material for cotton textiles, cotton, has increased the import tax. Therefore, it is expected that the reduction in labor in each fabric mill will inevitably increase.</p>

<h3 id="e129">German Consul General in Shanghai Issues a Written Statement <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Declaring the Truth of the German Incident</p>
<p>Is Merely a Purge Movement by the National Socialist Party</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the recent turmoil in Germany has been settled by Premier Hitler with lightning speed. German Consul General in Shanghai, Kriebel, fearing that the distance between China and Germany would lead to a lack of understanding of the incident, issued a written statement yesterday afternoon, saying that the Chinese newspapers in Shanghai have made many comments on the situation in Germany and the incident that occurred recently, but some of the reasons cited are not consistent with the facts. The German incident that occurred recently is only a purge movement that is actually needed by the National Socialist Party, eliminating those who abuse their powers and harm the public for their own selfish interests. They are a very small number, and the security and order disturbed by them have been completely restored and are as peaceful as before. As for Vice-Chancellor Papen's speech, it has nothing to do with this incident, and there is no so-called reactionary act against National Socialism. The German people are now working together wholeheartedly to support their leader Hitler. Thanks to Hitler, Germany has been rescued from the greatest difficulties in politics, economy, and culture. The realization of the rescue is due to Hitler's fundamental elimination of the idea of class struggle in Germany and the replacement of it with the spirit of mutual cooperation between entrepreneurs and craftsmen for the common welfare of the country and the people. The primary effect of this reform of thought has been proven by facts, that is, Germany has more than 3 million unemployed people who have been able to work and make a living thanks to National Socialism. Given the facts, how can it be said that this is an act of oppression of the people? As for the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, no third party participated except for the two. As the world knows, the German people not only do not feel uneasy, but also express their understanding and support for it.</p>

<h3 id="e131">International Trade Bureau Plans to Promote Domestic Goods in Southeast Asia <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, told reporters yesterday that after Minister Chen Shi returned from an inspection in Southeast Asia, he entrusted me with the responsibility of promoting the development of trade in that area. The targets of the development are our compatriots and natives in the local area, with emphasis on the latter. Because of their habits, most of our compatriots have adopted domestic products for their food and clothing needs, and the number of products that can be further promoted is limited. Therefore, it is more important to cater to the needs of the local people. However, the first competitor to be encountered in the development is Japanese goods. Because they have the assistance of the government's great power and organized promotion, they have almost taken away the market. Even in terms of rubber cloth shoes, the local tax is 3 jiao per pair, while Japanese goods are sold for only 2.9 jiao. The extent of the price cut can be seen from this. The International Trade Bureau is now contacting domestic merchants and factories in order to investigate the nature, cost, and price of their products, and to assist manufacturers in making organized promotions to compete with other goods. Although the progress is very slow, the plan is to be thorough. At the beginning of development, losses are inevitable, but it is necessary to seek a way to develop in a difficult situation. Director He further stated that to develop foreign trade, the points that must be paid attention to are: (1) standardization of production, (2) reducing costs, (3) paying attention to international market conditions, and (4) focusing on international publicity. Chinese merchants have always not paid attention to the above points. Now that they have the awareness of developing abroad, it is hoped that they will pay close attention to this.</p>

<p>According to Fang's family members, whether the coffin will be transported to Fujian for burial has not been decided yet, because Fang's friends are all away from Shanghai for summer vacation, so they do not want to open the mourning hall for the time being. It will not be decided until the weather cools down in the autumn. Fang left behind a wife, a son, and two daughters. The son is 22 years old and studying at Aurora University. The two daughters are young. The family is quite desolate. Colleagues will petition the Central Government to grant a preferential pension and a public burial.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Foreign News Report: Naval Dispute Between Japanese and French Sailors <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports receiving two letters.</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate Suppresses Reckless Actions of Japanese Residents</p>
<p>The "China Press" reports: Last night (the 2nd) at 10 PM, a dispute arose between three French sailors and one Japanese sailor for some reason, almost leading to an incident. According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News, the three French sailors consumed eight yuan and twenty cents worth of drinks at the Tokyo Cafe on Seward Road but only wanted to pay with one five-yuan bill, leading to an argument. Subsequently, they were surrounded by Japanese people. One of the French sailors appeared to be drunk and engaged in a brawl with a Japanese sailor from a merchant ship. The Japanese sailor knocked him down with boxing techniques, and the other two French sailors went to help. However, the Japanese people also joined in to help the Japanese sailor. Fortunately, a Japanese police officer from the Municipal Council arrived at the scene to stop the fight, and the crowd dispersed, allowing the French sailors to leave. The French sailors later went to the Hongkou police station to report that they had been beaten by Japanese people, and one of them had even lost his military hat.</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported yesterday (the 4th) receiving two letters. One stated that Japanese residents and sailors interfering with Municipal Council police officers performing their duties had happened more than once. The Municipal Council authorities' repeated failure to stop these illegal actions was tantamount to betraying the trust given by taxpayers and ignoring their responsibility to maintain order in the concession. It was incomprehensible that the Municipal Council police officers, even when subjected to extreme hostility and even assault, did not use legitimate self-defense measures. As a taxpayer, the writer wished to know if the Municipal Council authorities could prevent the recurrence of the Zhabei Road incident or similar incidents in the future. The other letter stated briefly that both Chinese and foreign taxpayers now wanted to know how the Municipal Council and the Consular Body would maintain security and order in the Public Concession. Shameful incidents like the recent one in Hongkou could not be ignored and should be addressed with effective and practical methods to clearly define the powers and responsibilities of the Municipal Council. If they could not fulfill their responsibilities without interference from violent Japanese crowds, it would be better not to have police at all and let things take their natural course. On Thursday night, another case occurred in the Hongkou Garden. Two foreigners were sitting on a bench outside the enclosure when suddenly a Japanese man, who appeared to be of high status, fat, and with a small mustache, asked them to let him and his wife sit with them. One of the foreigners politely told him that they were waiting for two Western women to arrive. The Japanese man should have replied that he would let his wife sit for a while and give up the seat when the Western women arrived. Unexpectedly, he raised his hand and pushed the foreigner away, leading to a fight. Immediately, a Japanese mechanic wearing a blue craftsman's uniform joined in. The three fell to the ground and wrestled, but the Japanese were always dominant. Fortunately, a special patrol officer, a Japanese detective, arrived and broke them up. The Japanese mechanic was well-versed in boxing techniques and was wrapping his arm around the foreigner's neck, trying to suffocate him. If the fight had continued, a serious incident might have occurred. Looking at the cases that have occurred in recent days, the Japanese in Shanghai harbored xenophobic intentions and were trying to create incidents deliberately. The status of the Public Concession, especially the Hongkou area, should be clarified once and for all. The Municipal Council Police Department had become merely a decoration, wasting taxpayers' money. If the same type of case could not be prevented, then Chinese and foreign residents in the concession should not pay taxes. If they could not get protection, why should they pay taxes? It would be better for the foreigners to move to the Chinese districts or the French Concession. As for the Chinese, they might know how to handle themselves, and they would likely close their shops and move to other areas that are not disturbed. One thing the writer did not understand was whether the Japanese Consulate and the Japanese Residents Association were turning a deaf ear to the repeated disturbances caused by vagrant Japanese people in the concession.</p>
<p>The Japanese Daily News reported that since the unfortunate incident involving marines and Western police officers on the night of the 27th, the Japanese people had been extremely agitated and had acted recklessly. Furthermore, on the night of the 1st, marines had a dispute with British and Russian people, and it was the same as the previous time; unstable actions were about to occur. Fortunately, the police of the Consulate General suppressed them, and a major problem was avoided. However, in an international city, the attitude of the Empire's subjects was repeatedly subjected to such cases, and the onlookers were going beyond normal behavior, which was extremely regrettable. The police of the Consulate General, in view of the inevitable continuation of unfortunate incidents if this continued, had been working hard to find countermeasures since the first Zhabei Road incident. Until the 2nd, after the Municipal Council police cooperated in a general mobilization, ten Japanese people had been arrested and were currently under investigation. However, to prevent the recurrence of incidents, last night (the 2nd), ten Japanese patrol officers were dispatched from the Hongkou police station of the Municipal Council in front of the Marine Corps outpost. In addition, the Chief of Police, Mr. Hanari, of the Consulate General led the entire police force to Kunshan Garden to set up a special alert line. At the same time, the atmosphere inside the Consulate General Police Department was unusually tense. To prevent such problems from happening again in the future, the Japanese residents were told to respect themselves and exercise self-control so as not to create an unstable atmosphere or escalate the incident.</p>

<p>The Route to the City Center Can Be Started Soon</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Is Actively Preparing for Schools, Markets, Etc.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Greater Shanghai Plan, which the municipal authorities are working hard on, is now being actively promoted step by step. The 3.5 million yuan of municipal bonds issued by the Municipal Government this year will be entirely allocated to the construction of the Greater Shanghai Plan. Although the Qijiang Wharf has had to be postponed temporarily due to the impact of temporary economic difficulties, the railway line to the city center can be started soon. According to the reporter's inquiry, the situation is as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Recent Situation of Important Buildings <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The reporter met with Mr. Xue Cixin, acting director of the Municipal Works Bureau, to discuss the recent progress of various important buildings in the city center. According to the conversation, all plans for the stadium have been completed, and the northern part of the original municipal park and the empty land to its west will be used as the base. Initially, the construction could not start immediately because the procedures for issuing municipal bonds had not been completed. Now that it has been passed by the Legislative Yuan, the construction of the stadium can start soon. As for the site of the museum and library, it has been selected on the large open space in front of the municipal government, forming a three-legged shape with the municipal government. The construction can be tendered soon. In addition, the municipal hospital can also be realized in a short time.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Separate Branch Line in Songhu <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Xue also said that the completion of important buildings in the city center can be expected soon. However, transportation should be made more convenient day by day. Therefore, the city has consulted with the Ministry of Railways to open a separate branch line of the Songhu Railway to the city center. The Ministry of Railways has agreed to do so. The route has been surveyed and starts from Gaojing Temple, passes through Sanmin Road, and ends at Songhu Road. The original roadbed of Sanmin Road will be allocated to the Ministry of Railways for laying railway tracks, so the land acquisition has actually been resolved. Only the laying of sleepers and tracks by the Ministry of Railways is awaited. Generally, the project can be completed before the autumn of next year.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Enthusiastic Investment From All Sides <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The construction of the city center is now actively underway, and investment from all sides is also very enthusiastic. In the future, citizens will definitely be happy to move to the city center. The municipal government will now first encourage all employees to move in as a guide for the general public. At the same time, the necessary problems of markets and schools have also been actively planned by the Municipal Government's Municipal Works Bureau and the Municipal Education Bureau to avoid difficulties after the employees move in. This equipment is easier to carry out, so it may be completed within the year.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Wang Delin's Letter to Compatriots Within the Pass <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Compatriots Outside the Pass Are Tragically Massacred</p>
<p>Strenuous Struggle Not to Forget National Hatred</p>
<p>Since returning to China last summer, Wang Delin, commander-in-chief of the Northeast Volunteer Army, has reorganized his old troops and led the resistance against Japan. The struggle is arduous, and his determination has not diminished. Now that the green gauze tents are rising, it is a good opportunity to recover lost territory. Yesterday, a special envoy brought a letter to compatriots within the pass, which was handed over to his newly arrived chief of staff, Jia Mingzhou, in Shanghai for publication and appealed to all sectors for assistance. The letter reads: "To newspaper offices and compatriots across the country: Since the Japanese bandits occupied our Northeast, it has been three years. Our tens of millions of compatriots are groaning and seeking help under the trampling of iron hooves. Our hundreds of thousands of volunteer soldiers are fighting hard against the stubborn enemy, and they are bleeding for the country every day. Mountains and rivers are far apart, and days and months pass. Have our compatriots within the pass forgotten? The Japanese imperialists are determined to annex our entire China. The Tanaka Memorial has long established a conspiracy, and the recent April 17 statement has exposed their ambitions even more. Like greedy boars and long snakes, they devour everything. Looking at their recent tricks and opportunities, they are suddenly approaching North China and plotting South China. Their greedy and violent intentions are obvious. Delin is indignant at the rampant violence of the bandits and follows the military's natural duty to defend the country. After the September 18 Incident, he immediately revolted in eastern Jilin and led starving and exhausted troops to fight the stubborn enemy. They advanced wave upon wave, making repeated efforts, destroying railways, cutting off their lifeline, and conquering famous cities, establishing a foundation for our advance. Eventually, he had to retreat to Russia due to running out of ammunition and reinforcements. However, Delin's determination to resist Japan is unwavering. Since returning to China last summer, he has reorganized his old troops and continued to work, using surprise attacks and sometimes making a feint to the east while attacking in the west. Although he has not been able to recover the territory or eliminate the villains, it is enough to avenge the country's hatred and give them a lesson. In the past year, the various units have fought hundreds of battles against the enemy in Hulin, Dongning, Dunhua, Mishan, Wangqing, Yanji, Antu, Zhuhe, Binzhou, and other counties. In the end, due to a lack of pay and ammunition, the overall plan could not be carried out. I am very sad. Now that the strong bandits have entered the hall and room, the country is still singing and dancing, completely forgetting that the ownership of 2.4 million square miles of territory and 40 million compatriots has been transferred to slaves. The morale of the people is so depressed. This is indeed a tearful cry for the future of the nation. In addition, Japanese armed immigrants have recently moved to the Northeast, forcibly collecting civilian guns and confiscating civilian property, making it impossible for our compatriots to survive. Our compatriots could not bear it and rose up in resistance. Therefore, there was the case of the Yilan leader Duan, who killed his family and revolted, and the battle of Xie Wendong of Tulong Mountain, who defeated and killed Commander Iizuka. Such things are too numerous to mention. The strong bandits were angry and sent out large teams to massacre our compatriots who had no fighting power, especially in Yilan, Boli, Hongluo, Fushun, and other counties, where the damage was the most severe, numbering no less than 50,000. The inhumanity of the Japanese can be seen here. Life is uncertain, and everyone is in danger. Therefore, compatriots from all counties have brought their old and young to join our troops, crying for protection. At this critical moment of national crisis, saving the country and seeking survival depends on promoting the morale of the people. In the past, Premier Sun Yat-sen led the National Revolution and always took awakening the people as the first priority. His legacy is always the model for the world. Delin is just a soldier with a heart full of enthusiasm and loyalty, and he only wants to serve the country. He knows that starving and exhausted soldiers cannot match elite troops, and that isolated troops in the borderlands cannot match the strength of the whole country. However, he who knows that it cannot be done and still does it wants to use the righteousness of sacrificing for the country to awaken the people, inspire them to work hard, and go to the national crisis together. However, our troops have been fighting hard for many years. They have more than enough courage to kill the enemy, but the situation is becoming more and more difficult. Now that we have the right time of day, autumn and winter will arrive in a blink of an eye. The borderlands are bitterly cold, and the wind and snow are raging. Fingers and skin will be broken. Our soldiers who have no clothes or food will not die in the fierce artillery fire but will die from unbearable hunger and cold. Every time Delin thinks about this, he wanders all night, feeling sad and desperate. I still hope that our compatriots across the country will not forget the country's hatred, extend their righteous indignation, and encourage the determination to resist Japan for a long time. Do not give the impression of only having five minutes of enthusiasm. Please generously provide assistance to our troops, find ways to provide relief, so that the soldiers and horses can be full of energy, the military might can be strengthened, the shame can be washed away, the recovery of the mountains and rivers can be expected, and the revival of the nation can be relied upon. I present my words in tears, and I hope you will take care of them."</p>
<h3 id="e141">The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Again Contests the Right to Manage Pilotage <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Please Issue the Interim Regulations for Research</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously contested the changes to the pilotage rules promulgated by our government by a foreign customs officer, and it has sent several telegrams to the Executive Yuan to fight for this right, as reported in previous newspapers. Now it is known that the association telegraphed the government again yesterday to strive to safeguard national rights. The original text is recorded as follows: "To the Executive Yuan in Nanjing: On the first of this month, we received a letter from the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Pilotage Association stating that, according to reliable information from foreigners, the case of our country recovering pilotage rights was previously opposed by a customs officer, who demanded amendments to the pilotage regulations promulgated on September 13 of the previous year. The Executive Yuan has acceded to the request and has four principles for the Ministry of Finance to follow in drafting the amendments. It has secretly sought the opinions of foreign customs officers and, with their approval, it can be published, named the 'Interim Regulations,' etc. According to this new chapter, seeking the opinions of foreigners first is considered non-negotiation. The power of the Customs Office is in control of financial power, and the tail is too big to shake. It is an open secret. Therefore, the content of the new chapter is not known. Our association has informed the National Government of the advantages and disadvantages and exposed the inside story. We requested the authorities to preside over the case before approving it, and to issue it to our association for discussion with relevant pilotage groups to respect public opinion. The Customs Office is employed by our country and follows the orders of the competent authorities to handle customs affairs. It does not have the right to participate in the prior formulation of central laws and regulations. If the amendment of the regulations requires its approval, it is as if the foreign customs officer who is carrying out the orders has the power of final approval. It is truly like the ancients said, 'Putting shoes and hats upside down.' If this end is opened, how can it be a country? In addition, the Customs Office is actually holding both ends and wantonly obstructing the recovery of pilotage management rights. If the amendment of the regulations is approved by it, it cannot be beneficial to our country if it is beneficial to foreigners. The advantages and disadvantages are obvious. Since the occurrence of this case, the affiliated association has appealed three times, hoping to do its best to recover the lost rights for the country. We request your institute to regard public opinion as important and to issue the interim regulations to the relevant groups for research to avoid hasty publication and further regret. It is a public convenience. Sincerely, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>The Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Department specially planned to manufacture military trainer planes to train aviation talents and enrich the national defense force.</p>
<p>Since work began in April of this year, after two months of intensive work, it was fully completed on the 28th of last month. The fuselage is extremely strong.

<p>The Ministry of Finance Tax Office yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, saying, "The case was approved in your association's commercial letter No. 854, according to a letter from the San Shan Fu Ning Guildhall in northern Shanghai, which stated that the freight of wheat flour to Min carried a single photo, a total of 42,700 packages of flour, which was due to special circumstances that exceeded the tax refund deadline, asking for a request for a flexible refund, etc., and asking for a check and handling, etc., and attaching a list of photos to the office. When it was verified, the photos of 18,000 packages of wheat flour that had been overdue for more than a month were removed, and the remaining 24,700 packages of wheat flour were immediately checked and the original photos were sent to the Fuzhou Management Office for verification and reply, and the letters were replied to in advance in the file. Now, according to the Fuzhou Management Office's report, the inspection shows that the photos are still consistent, etc. After reviewing this case, it has been verified to be accurate, and a refund of the actual tax of 2,099 yuan and 50 cents should be approved. In addition to instructions, a tax refund certificate is issued and sent for verification, and it is hoped that the hall will forward the certificate to the hall for preparation of a receipt to the office for direct collection.</p>

<p>Since the election of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the two representatives, Wang Xiaolai and Wang Yansong, have been elected as supervisors after the term of office of the executive committee members has expired. The two gentlemen believe that such selection still cannot get rid of association affairs, so they have successively sent letters requesting resignation to retire. The new members of this session believe that Mr. Wang and others have served the Chamber of Commerce and have made many achievements, so they decided to retain them unanimously. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Reply directly: Turning over a large letter, discussing resigning from the position of permanent elected supervisor of this session, should be handled by the new third-session staff. In the third session of the Executive Committee on July 1, the inauguration ceremony was held, and at the time of the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, your letter was submitted for discussion. Everyone believes that your service to this association has been tireless and has always been admired by your colleagues. It is human nature to think about rest after a long period of work. Your colleagues love the association and love the public, and we hope that you will take care of both. This time, the change of appointment to supervisor meets once a month according to the regulations. The time spent serving this association is much less than when you were a standing committee member. You can use your business leisure time to help. The purpose of small rest in your instructions is still consistent. The decision was unanimous to earnestly retain the case. The corresponding record case is happy, and we hope that you will consider your colleagues' intentions, restrain your noble feelings, and this is the most hopeful."</p>

<p>Japanese Soldiers Violently Beat Rickshaw Pullers and Angered Chinese Women</p>
<p>Western Police Officers Were Also Trampled and Police Authority Was Endangered</p>
<p>The Citizens' Union of the First Special District recently received a statement from Yang Hailin, who claimed that his wife, Yang Mo, was unreasonably and violently beaten by Japanese soldiers, and applied for assistance from the association. The association sent a special letter to the Municipal Council yesterday requesting an appeal to reassure public opinion. The original text is divided and recorded as follows.</p>
<p>"Letter to the Municipal Council: According to the request of citizen Yang Hailin, who claims that he lives at No. 5 Fulan Lane, Zhabei Road, his wife, Yang Mo, was cooling off at the entrance of the lane on the 27th of this month due to the hot weather. A Japanese sailor took a rickshaw and got off in front of the Donghe Pavilion on Zhabei Road. He did not pay the rickshaw fare but beat the rickshaw puller. His wife witnessed such violence and called for the rickshaw puller to escape. Unexpectedly, the Japanese soldier was unreasonable and twisted the wife and beat her, leaving her covered in injuries. Later, two Chinese and Western police officers came to rescue her, but they were taken to the Japanese headquarters by the Japanese soldier and Japanese people in plain clothes. Such violent behavior is infuriating. We request rescue. The citizens of the concession have the obligation to pay taxes, and protecting the safety of citizens and the locality is the duty of the Municipal Council. This time, Japanese soldiers were violent, rampant, and unscrupulous. The Municipal Council could not stop them, causing the loss of police authority in the concession. It is very serious. If it is not strictly punished, the consequences are unimaginable. This association is a group of citizens in the Public Concession. Because local security is in danger, it is difficult to remain silent. After the general meeting, it was decided to publicly elect Yu Hualong, Zhang Yichen, Chen Jicheng, Ye Jiaxing, and other members as representatives to send a letter. We hope to meet with you and ask you to instruct us on how to punish the perpetrators and compensate for the injuries, and to ensure local security in the future to reassure public opinion and stabilize the locality. It is for public convenience."</p>
<h3 id="e150">The All-Zhejiang Association Presented a Letter to the Provincial Government Yesterday Asking to Stop Collecting Special Construction Donations <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>To Be the First Voice in Implementing the Reduction and Exemption of Land Tax Surcharges</p>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Association of this city specially presented to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, saying, "Zhejiang Province has always been known as the area with the heaviest land tax. The old Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou prefectures followed the corruption of the former Qing Dynasty's southern transport and were particularly unequal burdens. In recent years, all new policies have been implemented, and there has been no dare not to give land tax surcharges, which has depleted resources. The people of Zhejiang have become more and more difficult, and they have even brewed the tragic scene of the collapse of Chen Village today. The central government has repeatedly issued clear orders that the land tax surcharge shall not exceed one time the regular tax. Recently, the National Finance Conference decided to abolish the land tax surcharges of various provinces and abolish all kinds of excessive taxes and miscellaneous taxes, and to allocate the stamp tax and tobacco and alcohol license tax, which belong to the national tax, to the provincial and local governments as compensation after the reduction and exemption of surcharges and miscellaneous taxes. This is the day when our people see the sky. Check the regular amount of land tax in Zhejiang Province, and the heaviest counties pay more than one penny per mu and less than one dou of offset money, which totals only 5.5 yuan. The current lightest county must pay more than 1.78 yuan in regular and surcharge mergers, which exceeds the regular tax of the heaviest counties two or three times. The surcharges are superimposed, which is an unprecedented creation of land tax. The military special donations collected since the 17th year of the Republic of China, later renamed special construction donations, are now allocated to the debt fund, with each tael of land tax and each shi of offset money adding one yuan each, which is especially large. According to the results of the discussion on the case of reviewing and reducing the land tax surcharge by your office, this special construction donation accounted for 55.6% of the surcharge in the first period and 30.3% in the second period, accounting for 40% to 50% of the total surcharge. There is also a special construction surcharge, which accounted for 8.3% of the surcharge in the first period and 9.1% in the second period. How much capacity do people have, and how can they be allowed to continue to bear this heavy burden superimposed? Although it is stated that this special donation is not a permanent burden and will be exempted after the debt settlement case is completely cleared, and each county is allowed to deduct it when calculating the total amount of land tax surcharge, this special donation is exempted from the calculation to show that it does not violate the central government's clear order of not exceeding one time the regular tax. However, all surcharges are temporary in nature, and it is not only the special construction donation that is the case. The burden on the people of Zhejiang is very heavy, and there is an urgent need for review and reduction. Fortunately, the central government is aware of the financial difficulties of local governments and the suffering of the people, and it is willing to allocate national taxes to subsidize the provincial and local governments. Our Zhejiang debt fund should not be worried about being unsettled. We should immediately stop collecting this special construction donation in the next period of this year. At the same time, we should strictly implement austerity policies and gradually reduce other surcharges and miscellaneous taxes to start anew with the people. Our association believes that the provincial and county finances are equally scarce, and various surcharges are related to the promotion of new policies. Therefore, we dare not request the simultaneous abolition of all the donations that harm the people, but only ask that the special construction donation, which harms the people most, be stopped first as a preliminary measure to reduce and exempt land tax surcharges in accordance with the order of the Yuan. This should not be difficult. If we can reduce the people's financial resources by one point, we will retain one point of vitality for the countryside. Your Excellency has lingering illnesses and must be able to grant our request to comfort the expectations of the people of Zhejiang. Therefore, we urgently present this matter and ask you to review and implement it.</p>

<h3 id="e152">The Anglo-American Tobacco Factory Labor Strike Yesterday's News <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Meeting of the Strike Committee: The 12th meeting of the Strike Committee was held at 4:00 PM yesterday. The Chairman, Chen De, resolved the following matters: (1) Request the Support Association to notify factories such as Great American, Flag, etc., not to roll cigarettes for the Anglo-American Tobacco Company. Request the Chinese tobacco factories to send a letter to the Tobacco Merchants Association, responsible for notification, that they are also not allowed to roll cigarettes. Otherwise, if any are found, they will be dealt with as products of the boycott of the Anglo-American Tobacco Company. (2) Request the Support Association to provide relief to the workers as soon as possible. (3) Stipulate the number of Difficult Position Team members at 284, Propaganda Team members at 76, and Women's Propaganda Team members at 52. No increases are allowed in the future without the approval of the Strike Committee. (4) Registration deadline is the 10th of this month. Remainder omitted.</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government: Yesterday morning, the association, led by standing committee members Chen De, Liu Dehua, Zhang Ziping, Dong Aosheng, Lou Jingguan, Wang Amao, Hu Xiaomei, executive committee member Xiao Gengsheng, and representatives from various departments, totaling 141 people, went to the Municipal Government to petition. Secretary-General Yu received them and promised to resolve the Strike Committee's demands for punishment of the perpetrators, apology, compensation for medical expenses, and relief for workers, regarding the factory's assault on workers on June 4th. Other matters were relayed to the Mayor. The representatives withdrew at 2:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Petition: To present a petition, since the Anglo-American Tobacco Company illegally closed the factory, nearly two months have passed. The company's oppressive behavior has intensified. On June 4th, they hired White Russian thugs to work in the factory, assaulting many workers and withholding the wages due to the old factory workers from April 15th to May 12th, causing the workers unbearable suffering. The association has submitted a petition to your government, requesting swift relief, negotiation for punishment of the perpetrators, apology, compensation for medical expenses, and issuance of wages to the old factory workers, etc., on record. However, many days have passed without a reply, causing deep concern. It is believed that the association's previous submissions, concerning the government's credibility or the relief of workers, are of utmost importance and cannot be delayed. The association received replies from Commander Chiang of the Nanchang Military Headquarters on June 10th and June 27th, which have been forwarded to your government for investigation and action. It is assumed that your government has also received the order simultaneously, and relief and other items are being handled. Therefore, representatives of the association, Chen Peide, Liu Dehua, Lou Jingguan, Dong Aosheng, Zhang Ziping, Hu Xiaomei, Wang Amao, and over 140 others, are dispatched to your government to request instructions on everything, urgently seeking prompt instructions on the negotiation process for punishment of the perpetrators, apology, compensation for medical expenses, issuance of wages to the old factory workers, and relief measures for the workers, for compliance. We await your orders with utmost urgency.</p>

<p>When the China-America Tobacco Company began issuing its Guanghua brand of Chinese standard cigarettes, due to the urgent needs of all parties, they rushed to produce and pack them day and night. It was said that female workers mistakenly packed sixty checks into the cigarettes, with a face value of several thousand yuan. Later, the company published a notice offering to redeem them at half price. The incident was strange and sensational for a time and is still talked about as a curious tale. Yesterday, visitors to the company's Nanjing Road branch to view the national product display competition saw that on the left side of the Guanghua brand display window, all the checks redeemed at half price were pasted on a dazzling golden board, with names and addresses attached. Those circulating in the market that had not yet been redeemed had blank spaces reserved for them. The viewers thronged the area, considering it an innovative display.</p>

It is expected that the school will be able to move into the new school building after the summer vacation this year. All full-time teachers have been provided with residences.

Upon learning that the Rose Garden New Village, founded by Zhang Yongnian, was located right next to the school and that the village's public facilities, educational plans, and transportation were all excellent, and that about 30 households had already joined from various circles, Principal Zheng inquired in detail about the village's various important designs and greatly admired them. In addition to agreeing to introduce parents of Shanghai High School students to join according to their ability, he also agreed to assist in the village's future educational plans as appropriate. It is also heard that Zhang Shenhuan, the school's secretary, has been greatly assisting in the village's recruitment campaign.

<p>On the afternoon of the 9th of last month, at the accounting firm of Xue Mai Luo at 9 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, the comprador Zhou Jinggeng sent his employees Gao Yushu, Feng Ti'e, and Wan Guirong to the bank to exchange 18,900 yuan of new banknotes from the China Industrial Bank. They returned to the office at 4:30 PM, preparing to deliver them to Yiyuan Dog Racing Track for use that evening. Unexpectedly, armed robbers broke in, stole 12,000 yuan (6,000 yuan each) from Gao and Feng, and fled. After the victims reported the incident to the police, the French police's special agency, based on the victims' report, first arrested Zhang Zuming, a shareholder of Ruichangshun Hardware Store at 101 Broadway, by Inspector Jin Jiulin and Detective Zhang Ziying, etc.. According to Zhang's confession, they then arrested Zhuang Yuanda, the owner of a winery, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, a hardware peddler, and Tang Qingyue, the director of Dade Hospital on Gordon Road, who was from Taicang. The four men were transferred to the Second Special District District Court, and the police department filed a public prosecution based on Article 1, Clause 14 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. The victims, as plaintiffs, also hired lawyers to file private lawsuits, requesting the recovery of the stolen money. The case had been tried and Zhang was ordered to remain in custody, while Zhuang and Wang were each released on bail with three guarantors, and Tang Qingyue remained on his original bail, awaiting sentencing on a scheduled date, as previously reported. Yesterday was the date for the sentencing in this case. The police brought Zhang Zuming to the court at 9:00 AM. Zhuang, Wang, and Tang, who were released on bail, along with their defense lawyer Osen and Zhang Zuming's defense lawyer Lin Yingqing, arrived at the court one after another at 9:00 AM. At 10:00 AM, Judge Li Changnian attended the first criminal court, summoned the defendants to the dock, and after briefly asking each person's name, read out the main text of the judgment, saying, "Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue are all not guilty. The plaintiff's incidental civil lawsuit is dismissed." After the judgment, Zhang Zuming was ordered to be transferred to the detention center during the appeal period, and the others remained on their original bail awaiting further instructions. Furthermore, in the news coverage of the trial on the 29th of last month, it was reported that Zhang Lifeng, the manager of Jing Daxiang Money Shop, testified in court about Zhang Zuming's deposit. It has now been learned that it was actually Zhang Lianfang, the manager of Heng Daxiang Hardware Store, who testified. The reporter was standing too far away at the time, and the voice was too low, leading to the misunderstanding. This correction is hereby attached.</p>
<h3 id="e164">National Product Leather Suitcases Selling Well in Southeast Asia <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Approximately One Million Yuan Annually</p>
<p>Further Improvement Could Lead to Greater Development</p>
<p>According to a report from the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, the export of domestic products to Malaya has gradually increased in recent years, with the leather suitcase industry being the most prominent. It has been found that these products come from Qingdao, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other places. Twenty years ago, suitcases in Malaya were all Western or Japanese goods, and domestic products had almost no foothold. In recent years, domestic leather suitcases have sold well in Southeast Asia, with an annual value of one million yuan. If they are further improved and actively promoted, Western and Japanese leather suitcases will have no room to stand.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Reasons for Inability to Manufacture in Southeast Asia <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The manufacture of leather suitcases is a semi-handicraft industry, so places in temperate zones such as Shanghai and Guangzhou are suitable. People in temperate zones can work from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM, for more than ten hours. Workers in tropical zones are absolutely incapable of doing this. Chinese wages are also low, so the cost is naturally lower. Therefore, manufacturing leather suitcases in Southeast Asia is not as convenient as transporting them from China.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Current Status of Domestic Leather Suitcase Sales <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The sales of domestic leather suitcases in Southeast Asia were most prosperous in the past few years, with annual exports to Malaya valued at several million yuan. However, in recent years, due to the economic downturn, the value has only been one million yuan. However, the lives of people in general commercial ports are becoming increasingly prosperous, and they love to be modern. The old-fashioned domestic leather suitcases are gradually being replaced by the semi-handicraft Western leather suitcase industry. Therefore, the emerging domestic leather suitcase industry still has hope for development in Malaya, if there is no special reason.</p>

<p>A Major Loss of Navigational Talent</p>
<p>Mr. Sha Huijia, a member of the Shanghai Pilot Association and a member of the Shanghai Maritime Administration's Ship Collision Dispute Handling Committee, served in the maritime industry for more than ten years. His knowledge and experience were widely admired. Unfortunately, he suddenly passed away from typhoid fever at his residence in Shanghai at 4:00 PM on the 30th of last month, at the young age of 31. Chinese and foreign maritime circles were deeply saddened by his passing. Mr. Sha, also known as Yin Cheng, was from Jiangyin, Jiangsu. In 1921, he graduated from Wusong Fisheries School. He then worked for Chang'an Shipping Company's Hua'an Merchant Shipping, rising from second officer to first officer to captain. In the five or six years that Mr. Sha served as captain, he traveled back and forth across the North and South Pacific Oceans and never caused a single accident, nor did he cause the company or the insurance company even the slightest loss. His excellent navigational skills were praised by Chinese and foreign maritime circles. In the autumn of the year before last, he joined the Shanghai Pilot Association as a member (Chinese pilots accounted for only two of the forty pilots). He guided foreign merchant ships in and out of Shanghai Port. The major foreign shipping companies</p>

<p>expressed their admiration for his knowledge and skills. After the establishment of the Shanghai Maritime Administration's Ship Collision Dispute Handling Committee, he was hired as a committee member. The companies were particularly impressed with his mediation and adjudication of ship collision cases. Mr. Sha was in the prime of his life when he suddenly passed away. China's maritime community already lamented the scarcity of talent, and now they have suffered this major loss. The mourners are not only those in the maritime community.</p>

<p>Four Letters Left for Various People</p>
<p>Forced to Commit Suicide, But Not Willing</p>
<p>At around 11:00 PM the night before last, a young male customer arrived at the Central Hotel in Xiaodongmen, claiming to be Ding Senfu, 23 years old, from Pudong. He paid one yuan for the room and then went out for a drink, asking the bellboy Wang Bingrong to lock the room. He returned to his room to rest at around 12:00 PM. Unexpectedly, the customer had not gotten up by yesterday afternoon. As usual, the bellboy asked the guest if he wanted to extend his stay. However, there was no response after knocking on the door for a long time. The bellboy knew something was wrong and reported it to the accountant, who devised a way to pry open the door. Suddenly, they saw the guest lying on the bed, foaming at the mouth, his face pale. He was barely breathing, and they knew he had taken poison. An empty bottle of A.O. was found on the table. According to those who recognized it, it was a sleeping pill. The incident was immediately reported to the Second Precinct of the First District for investigation. Chief Liu immediately dispatched Police Officer Li Fuyi to investigate. At the same time, the poisoned man was taken to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, but his life was hanging by a thread. Police Officer Li also found four letters left by the poisoned man: (1) to his sister Ding Jiazhen at 13 Jiangjiayuan, Xiaguan, Nanjing, (2) to his uncle Ding Zhuanghui at 25 Jinyuli, Nan Zhujiaqiao, and two other letters to relatives and friends. The letters stated the reason for his suicide, saying that he was forced to repay debts by the owner of a certain cigarette paper shop and the shareholder Yue Jinhe. Because he had been unemployed for a long time, he had no money to repay the debts. Unexpectedly, they threatened to use a gun against him, so he preferred to commit suicide. However, he was not willing, but was forced. He asked his uncle to seek justice, etc.</p>

<p>Adulterous Woman Claims Her Husband Committed Suicide</p>
<p>Liu Liangcai, a 29-year-old man from Taizhou, lived in Yiyuan Lane, Xinjia Road, and worked as a rickshaw puller. He had previously had an affair with a woman surnamed Lu from the same hometown, who was already 40 years old. However, Liu recently lost his job, and the woman abandoned him and found another lover. Liu learned that the woman was introduced by an old woman surnamed Jiang, who lived in Changxing Lane, Sanyang Road, Zhabei. On the afternoon before last, Liu went to kill the old woman with a sharp knife. Unexpectedly, Liu Liangcai was killed in the alleyway, with knife wounds on each side of his chest. The woman and the old woman claimed that Liu committed suicide. However, the police of the Fifth District, who were in charge of the area, found that he was killed while catching the woman in adultery. Therefore, the woman and the old woman were arrested. Yesterday, the neighborhood security officer Yan Liugen was ordered to report the case to the local court for inspection.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Minutes of Meeting of the Special District Rickshaw Industry <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The special district rickshaw industry held its 37th council meeting last night, chaired by Yin Zhiling. The results of the discussion: (1) The rickshaw pullers are exposed to the sun and heat, which is unbearable. Regarding the proposal to provide straw hats and sandals, it was resolved to appoint Mao Guangcai, Lu Dexin, and Qiu Jirang to be responsible for contacting the straw hat and sandal providers, soliciting styles, and inviting bids. (2) A council member suggested that a rickshaw numbered 1578 was lost on the road, and the new rickshaw was sent to Fair Road to have a copper seal made. However, Fair Road stated that the Rickshaw Committee notified them that if there was no new design, it would not be sealed. It was resolved to send a negotiation committee to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council. (3) Notify Tan Bozhi, the custodian of the fund committee, to send the seal to the bank immediately to comply with the number of people stipulated in the resolution of the general meeting. (4) Negotiate with the fund committee to temporarily borrow 3,000 yuan from the special donation fund to open a summer free clinic. (5) The custodian of the special donation fund will collect the outstanding special donations at the meeting and be responsible for delivering them to the bank. (6) The rickshaw business here is busy and works every day. Each director should be responsible for their work. It was resolved that each director of each department should be responsible for everything internally. External negotiations will still be handled by the previously appointed Yin, Hou, and Ma, the three negotiation committee members. (7) Lu, the treasurer, requested ratification of the legal advisory fee hired by the office. It was resolved to wait until contact with Director Gu to handle it.</p>

<p>Elegant Women Enjoying Evening Drives in Endless Streams</p>
<p>It is now the height of summer, and the elegant women of Shanghai love to go for evening drives to escape the dust and heat and to regulate their lives. Since the opening of the central district of the city, the thirty-li-long and smooth avenue is brightly lit, like daytime. Elegant women on evening drives are all excited and exhilarated as they drive along. The lush trees along the way and the cool summer nights are truly a great escape. The colleagues of the Municipal Government Association, for the sake of the prosperity of the urban area and the convenience of tourists, have opened a small shop outside the Municipal Government Building. The interior equipment is in line with modern art. The Chinese and Western tea snacks, ice cream, Dutch water, and all kinds of cold drinks and cold food sold are both hygienic and economical. Recently, cool chairs have also been placed on the grass for tourists to rest. As a result, tourists are all delighted and admire the thoughtfulness of the designers. It is heard that the City Center District Construction Committee is planning to set up various recreational activities in the First Park to meet the needs of summer vacationers and is actively preparing for them.</p>

<p>Hospitals for Epidemic Diseases are Striving to Provide Treatment</p>
<p>There is Great Panic Over Drinking Water in the Interior</p>
<p>The weather in Shanghai is extremely hot, and this has been the case for ten days. The daily high temperature has always reached 102-103 degrees. The city's health authorities are doing everything possible to prevent and treat epidemics, and the hospitals for epidemic diseases are also intensifying their work. Fortunately, true cholera has not yet been discovered, but the drought and lack of rain have also made drinking water a problem in the interior. The reporter from Shen Shi News Agency explored and recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e174">Intensifying Epidemic Prevention and Free Injections <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>In view of the extremely hot weather and the proliferation of epidemics, the Municipal Health Bureau is paying special attention to prevention work. The Nanshi Clinic, the Municipal</p>
<p>Hospital for Epidemic Diseases, and the City Center Clinic are all administering preventative injections at the same time. More than 10,000 citizens have received injections. The bureau is paying particular attention to organizations. The bureau has sent personnel to various schools in the city to administer injections. The number of people injected so far: Cao Nan Elementary School 300 people, Anbang Elementary School 61 people, Pengpu Elementary School 372 people, Huadong Elementary School 740 people, Jieyuan Elementary School 84 people, Tan Zhen Elementary School 198 people, Xiaozha Elementary School 83 people, Yangcun Elementary School 150 people, McLaren High School 165 people, Yingsi Elementary School 300 people, Fahua Elementary School 155 people, Pingan Elementary School 221 people, Bengbu Elementary School 340 people, Guanghua University 408 people, a total of 3,417 people. In addition, 118 people have been injected at Yizhong Machinery Company.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Hospitals are Working Under Great Strain <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The epidemic hospitals in the city are all intensifying their work during this epidemic. The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road has treated more than 2,000 people since it began treating patients on the 25th of last month. The most common cases are heatstroke, malaria, and gastroenteritis. The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital on Tangshan Road opened on the first day of this month and has treated more than 1,000 people in the past three days. The Special District Rickshaw Association, in order to protect the health of the coolies, has set up five free clinics and has arranged for Minqiang Hospital on Robert Dollar Road to provide free preventative injections for the coolies. In addition, the Red Cross Epidemic Hospital will be opening earlier from today to benefit the citizens. The health departments of the Public Concession and the French Concession are also administering injections to residents and posting slogans on the streets, advising residents to pay attention to their diet to prevent cholera.</p>

<p>The weather is severely dry, and rural areas are suffering from disasters. This has become an unavoidable fact. According to farmers who have recently come to Shanghai from the countryside, there has been no rain for a long time in the villages, and farmers are relying on waterwheels for irrigation. However, this is a drop in the bucket and does not help the situation. Moreover, the water stored in fields and ponds is almost completely dry. This year's autumn harvest will be at most 50% for low-lying fields, and high-lying fields will likely yield nothing. Although there have been occasional bumper harvests followed by disasters in recent years, farmers, while not wealthy enough to accumulate savings, have been able to barely maintain their lives. This year's drought, once it takes hold, will plunge rural areas into dire straits.</p>

<p>The drinking water problem caused by the severe drought is also quite serious. In cities, people are not aware of the problem because of the supply from waterworks. However, in the countryside, where people rely on rivers, the long drought and lack of rain have caused rivers to dry up, creating a serious problem. In places such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and Jiaxing, river channels are shallow and silted, and the water quality is turbid. Residents are feeling a severe lack of drinking water. If there is no more rain, a major panic is bound to ensue.</p>
<p>Xu Zhou Bandit Zhang Huaiqing Extorts 200,000 from Ji Juemi</p>
<p>Ji Sends People Twice to Wuxi to Negotiate, Agreeing to Pay 4,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Luring Him to Shanghai to Collect the Money, Reporting to the Police to Arrest Him</p>
<p>丨Ji's Ancestral Graves Have Been Dug Up and Destroyed by Bandits丨</p>
<p>Ji Juemi, the manager of Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co. on Nanjing Road and a native of Xuzhou, received five threatening letters from bandits between November last year and the 10th of last month, demanding 200,000 yuan, or else they would use bombs and guns. Ji knew that this was the work of a notorious local bandit, so he secretly requested the Xuzhou Garrison Command to arrest and pursue him, but no clues could be found. Recently, it was discovered that the bandit leader, Zhang Huaiqing, a 32-year-old native of Xuzhou, was using the alias Gu Xinzhai and staying in Wuxi. On the 21st of last month, Ji sent his representative, Pan Litian, to Wuxi to find him. Pan met Zhang at the Railway Hotel, and after negotiations, the amount was reduced by 80,000 yuan. Pan only agreed to several thousand yuan and returned unsatisfied. On the 26th, he sent his cook, Zhu Benqing, to Wuxi to negotiate again. As a result, they agreed on 4,000 yuan, instructing him to come to Shanghai to collect the money, assuring him that nothing else would happen. Until the day before yesterday, they tricked him into coming to Shanghai and temporarily staying in an empty house at 1255 Avenue Foch (note: this house is owned by Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co.). It was agreed that 2,000 yuan would be paid first. Around 10 o'clock, they secretly informed the Yangshupu Police Station, and Chinese Detective Liu Wenhan, together with a Western detective, accompanied Zhu Benqing with hell money from the Bank of the Underworld, using two real ten-yuan notes from the China Industrial Bank and the China Commercial Bank on top to make it look like 2,000 yuan. Zhu went in first, and just as he was handing over the money, the Chinese and Western detectives rushed in and arrested him. Inside the house, there was already an opium pipe, an opium lamp, and an opium tool, which were all taken to the police station and confiscated. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court.</p>
<p>In the Third Criminal Court, the Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer, Li Zhishan, described the events, stating that an investigation revealed that the victim in this case, Ji Juemi, was originally named Pan when he was young in Xuzhou. He changed his name to Ji after coming to Shanghai. Therefore, his ancestral graves were all in his hometown. Unexpectedly, in November of last year, the bandits dug up his ancestral graves, took away the remains, and hid them without a trace. Later, they sent a letter stating that if he wanted to retrieve the remains, he would have to pay 200,000 yuan, or else they would burn the bones to ashes and continue to dig up the remains of his parents, and then use bombs and guns to harm him. The victim knew that this was the work of local bandits, so he reported it to the local garrison command for arrest. The garrison command sent troops to suppress the bandits, causing the defendant to have no place to stand. Recently, he fled to Wuxi, and there was also a public notice for his arrest. Now, the police station requests an extension for further investigation. The evidence, including the hell money and a travel schedule from Wuxi to Shanghai found on his person, as well as the threatening letters and public notices, were presented for inspection. The defendant confessed that he had recently come to Shanghai from his hometown to sell cloth, had not been to Wuxi, and had nothing to do with the grave digging and extortion. He also denied having contacted Pan Litian and Zhu Benqing. He claimed his name was Gu Xinzhai, not Zhang Huaiqing, and his other statements were evasive, asking for leniency. The victim, Ji Juemi, was not present, but Pan and Zhu testified about the events. Zhu stated that he had previously had a dispute over selling livestock in his hometown, and the defendant had robbed him of all his money and then kidnapped him and demanded ransom. Because he had no money to pay, he was released. Zhu claimed that Zhang was a notorious bandit leader. Judge Liu Yugui ordered that he be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>A Clerk Conspires with a Policeman to Commit Theft</p>
<p>Openly Peddling the Stolen Goods at the Tianyun Building</p>
<p>The Welfare Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road recently suffered a major theft of goods, such as silk stockings and raincoats, worth approximately several thousand yuan. The case was reported to the police, who ordered an investigation. Recently, Chinese Detectives Shen Jinwen and Pang Ruiqing of the Laozha Police Station learned that the thieves in this case were peddling stolen goods at the Tianyun Building amusement park in the Wing On Company. They joined forces with a Western detective to lie in wait. Before long, a man from Nanxiang named Li Zhenhua was found peddling a box of silk stockings at the park. He was immediately arrested and taken back to the police station. It was discovered that Li was a clerk at the Welfare Company, and the silk stockings he possessed were part of the original stolen goods. They immediately searched Li's home at 120 Rue Eugène Bard, Hongkou, and found a large amount of stolen goods, worth approximately one thousand yuan. Based on Li's confession, they subsequently arrested three people: Luo Yingquan, the gatekeeper of the company and a native of this county, Wang Atao, a shop clerk, and Li Linggen. They recovered another portion of the stolen goods. The reason for the theft was that Li and others lived in the company at night, so they gradually took advantage of the opportunity to carry the goods out and sell them. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, explained the case and requested an extension for further investigation. After questioning by Judge Qian Hongye, he ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>The executive committee members of the Fourth District Branch of the First Special District of Shanghai City and the directors of the Lianyi Hall, concerned about local public welfare and charitable endeavors, convened a joint meeting of the two parties' executive officers and over thirty medical practitioners, including Cai Zhonghui, at the association's headquarters on Xiaoshadu Road yesterday. Guo Zhaowu presided over the meeting, and the following major cases were discussed and resolved: (1) The expenditure for coffin distribution is extremely strained. The kind-hearted Pan Shouren has been assisting with hundreds of coffins over the past two years. If the demand exceeds the supply, we should find a way to maintain the supply. (Resolution: Actively form a coffin distribution team, with each team consisting of ten members, including the team leader.) (2) The provision of medical consultations and medicine. Due to the extremely hot weather in early summer, all kinds of epidemic diseases are bound to follow. Preparations have already been made, and a date should be set for the opening of the clinic. (Resolution: The clinic will be opened on July 5th.) (Time: 8 a.m. to 12 p.m.) (3) How should the medicine and emergency remedies, such as scraping therapy water, generously donated by various philanthropists, be distributed? (Resolution: The Hall will distribute them fairly through its member pharmacies.) (4) The winter clothing distribution issue is reserved for further discussion. (5) Building the Hall into a Shanghai West Side charitable public welfare organization. We have repeatedly requested the Shanghai Municipal Council to exempt us from patrol taxes, but the Municipal Council has refused and repeatedly demanded payment, inevitably leading to litigation. How should we handle this? (Resolution: Prepare a document and submit it to the court requesting an exemption.) The meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been hot and there has been no rainfall. The cotton and bean seedlings planted by farmers are withering, and the rice paddies are dry, showing signs of drought. Therefore, farmers in the Longhua, Hongqiao, and Fahua areas of Shanghai West Side have initiated a prayer for rain starting yesterday. Beforehand, they contacted various villages to beat gongs and inform the public to offer sacrifices to the gods and pray for rain, parading back and forth. The various sub-stations 123 of the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, fearing a large crowd, specially dispatched regular shift police officers to accompany them. Although the matter is absurd, it is driven by utter sincerity.</p>

<p>A hawker named Zhang Liangtai recently set up a watermelon stall on Rue Eugène Bard in Hongkou to take advantage of the summer season. His stall was in front of the rice shop opened by Liu Rongchang. The watermelon rinds were scattered all over the place, so Liu negotiated with him about the land rental fee, and a quarrel ensued. At that time, Zhang's elderly mother was standing by, holding her three-year-old grandson, watching idly. Seeing this, she stepped forward to intervene, and Liu pushed her, causing both the old woman and the baby to fall to the ground. After returning home, the child had chills and fever that night, and the child died the next day. Zhang claimed that Liu pushed his mother, causing his son to fall down and die unjustly, and requested an investigation. The Third Sub-station of the Fifth District instructed the local security officer to report the case to the court for an autopsy yesterday.</p>

This summer, he contracted heatstroke and, due to being nearly fifty years old and working too hard, he became exhausted and had to take a temporary leave of absence. For consultations and house calls, he has hired other famous doctors to act as substitutes. He will personally resume consultations when he recovers his health. Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram introducing him to treat a certain important person, but Dr. Niu politely declined.</p>

<p>Fan Zhixuan of Wumen is fond of painting. From a young age, he liked to use colorful pencils to draw figures, landscapes, birds, animals, insects, and fish. Those who saw his work marveled at it. Later, he obtained a painting album by Luntai and copied it tirelessly. At a young age, he taught at the Tonghui Elementary School in Shanghai. Despite the heavy teaching workload, he did not abandon painting. He further became a student of the famous Sichuan painters Zhang Shanzi and Daqian, devoting himself to the Shigu, Qingxiang Laoren, and Qushan schools. With the guidance of famous teachers and friends, his skills improved greatly. His tiger paintings, in particular, captured the spirit of his teacher. Even small paintings on silk or paper are considered precious. Recently, at the Dafengtang Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition, many of his paintings were sold, demonstrating his artistic skill and the large number of people who appreciate his work. Now, he is exhibiting over two hundred fan paintings created over the years at his personal fan painting exhibition held at the Tonghui Elementary School on Rue Wagner in the French Concession on July 4th, 5th, and 6th. The painting shown here is one of his exhibited works, with rich ink colors and a peaceful charm reminiscent of Fengchang.

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>We were shocked to read the large headline in your newspaper on the 2nd of this month, "Descendants of Jiang Mule Dispute Property in Lawsuit." The lawsuit between Jiang Jingfen and Jiang Yang relates to a separate matter. As for involving our family's origins, your newspaper, long a leader in domestic news, should record information accurately. We do not know the basis of this interview. Our ancestors founded the family with their bare hands and managed it diligently. The neighborhood knows this well and regards us as a model family. In particular, on September 18th of the 18th year of the Republic [1929], the Shen Bao published an article after the manuscript of "Old Man Yao's Collection of Unofficial History of Hong and Yang" in Banqiao, which is enough to demonstrate the facts and public opinion. Now, your newspaper has insulted our ancestors with groundless facts, causing shame to future generations. We are writing to request that your newspaper publish and correct our letter, and express your apologies to our family. We hope you will consider this. Sincerely, Jiang Xijue, representative of the Jiang Chunhui Tang family, July 3, 23rd year of the Republic [1934].</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e196">Subjective Truth and Objective Truth丨Answer to Mr. Meitang丨 <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>In terms of literal meaning, subjective truth refers to truth that can only exist in the human mind and not in external things. Conversely, objective truth refers to truth that exists in the objective world (i.e., external things) and cannot exist in human thought. Therefore, when talking about subjective truth, it is tantamount to saying, "What I think is how it is," while objective truth is saying, "I cannot participate with my opinion, it only depends on what the facts are."</p>
<p>However, in fact, such truth cannot be established. "What I think is how it is," and you also think is how it is, then everyone can call a deer a horse, how can this be considered truth? Truth must be distinguished from falsehood. If everyone uses themselves as the standard, it will be impossible to distinguish who is true and who is false. This kind of subjective truth cannot be considered truth. Objective truth is the same. If objective truth only exists in external things and not in human thought, then there is no way for human thought to relate to objective truth. Objective truth cannot be recognized by humans. If humans cannot recognize it, how can they know that it is truth?</p>
<p>Therefore, subjective truth and objective truth are two opposing things, but if the two things are distinctly separated and seen only as the dead literal definitions, then both will not be established. How can we make both of them established? That is to grasp the unity of these opposites.</p>
<p>How to grasp the unity of the opposites of subjective and objective? Before explaining, let's use an old story as an example: Somewhere there was a shield hanging, and two people came to judge it. One person stood in front of the shield and saw that it was gold, and insisted that the shield was gold. The other person stood behind the shield and saw that it was red, and insisted that the shield was red. So the two quarreled. In fact, the color of the shield was different on both sides. Each of them saw one side and did not see the other side. If they had seen both sides, they would not have quarreled.</p>
<p>The two people mentioned here both held a subjective truth. This kind of subjective truth is not the subjective opinion purely created by arbitrary delusion mentioned earlier, but because the observation is incomplete, causing people to hold onto one side of the thing, resulting in a one-sided truth. Although this truth is incomplete, it does grasp one side of the objective thing, so it can still be regarded as truth. At the same time, this truth is only one side of what the observer subjectively sees and cannot represent the true objective thing, so it is always subjective truth. Only when both sides of the shield have been observed and the opinions of the two people are combined can it become objective truth.</p>
<p>Therefore, subjective truth is one side of objective truth, and it is incomplete objective truth. When we find objective truth, we can overthrow subjective truth, but we cannot therefore completely reject the value of subjective truth. Because external things are multifaceted, our ability to recognize things cannot immediately grasp all aspects of things. Our recognition of things gradually deepens one aspect at a time, and our knowledge gradually increases. To achieve objective truth, we must first go through the process of subjective truth, starting from a partial, incomplete knowledge, and gradually reaching the realm of completeness. That is to say: "In any subjective truth, there will inevitably be a seed of objective truth. The increase of subjective truth is the growth of this seed. When it grows to a certain limit, the seed becomes a true objective truth." This is the so-called development of the process. People who do not understand this principle think that subjective truth and objective truth are absolutely separated and cannot be transformed into each other. This kind of view that separates things is the so-called metaphysical view. Its unreasonableness was mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Another point to note is that the properties of the various aspects of external things are not necessarily like a shield that can be placed there for us to see. Water is a fluid and transparent, which can be known at a glance, but the property that it will boil at a temperature of 100 degrees is not known at a glance. To know that it will boil, it must be burned on a fire. The properties of all things, as long as they are slightly deeper, must be processed and transformed by people before they can be revealed. That is to say, if people want to know the properties of things, they must practice in the things. The more practice, the deeper the knowledge of things. Each practice provides us with one aspect of the truth of things, and the sum of the truths of various practices can form the complete objective truth.</p>
<p>We cannot ignore subjective truth, but we must not exaggerate subjective truth. Subjective truth contains the seed of objective truth, so it cannot be ignored, but it is only a seed, so it cannot be exaggerated. We must constantly practice and constantly transform things to increase our knowledge. One of the characteristics of idealistic philosophy is that it separates us from practice and closes us in the subjective ivory tower of concepts, and we cannot deeply create in layers towards the internal properties of things, so we must oppose idealism.

<h3 id="e197">The Fragrant and Elusive Record of Imperial Cuisine <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>—Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Among the various seafood items, the commonly used ones include shark fin, fish maw, fish tripe, bird's nest, sea cucumber, etc. Their various methods of preparation are roughly the same as those outside the palace, so there is no need to repeat them.</p>
<p>Generally, the price of each kind of seafood is always a few points higher than ordinary beef, mutton, chicken, and duck, presumably because it is more difficult to obtain. However, in terms of their true taste, I really dare not compliment them. Even the Empress Dowager looks at various seafood dishes very plainly; she especially dislikes sea cucumber. Sea cucumber is a bland and tasteless thing, and its shape is even more ugly, but people generally say that it has nourishing properties, so it has to be included among those real delicacies.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager also has a particularly favorite dish, which is Qingdun Duck Tongues. These duck tongues are stewed together with duck meat, with at least twenty or thirty of them floating on top of the soup. Because this is the Empress Dowager's favorite dish, it is always served in a specially prepared apricot-yellow bowl, and it is always placed closest to the Empress Dowager. In addition, there is also a kind of salted duck webs, which is an essential special dish for every "snack"; but this thing has only one layer of webbed skin that can be chewed on, and the rest is all bones. Duck gizzards, duck organs, etc., are also often prepared in various different ways to serve as the Empress Dowager's side dishes. From these few points, it can be seen that the Empress Dowager is particularly fond of ducks; except for that piece of smelly duck butt, she simply refuses to let it go easily.</p>
<p>In the summer, various melons and fruits are on the market, and the chefs in the imperial kitchen have to use them to make several fresh seasonal special dishes to offer to the Empress Dowager as a tribute. Among them, one that the Empress Dowager appreciates the most is "Watermelon Boat." Its method of preparation is to dig out all the pulp from the watermelon, and fill it with diced chicken, diced ham, fresh lotus seeds, longan, walnuts, pine nuts, almonds, etc., and cover it again, and simmer it over low heat through water for several hours. The pure and delicious taste is not difficult for us to imagine! (74)</p>
<h3 id="e198">Mahjong <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>In China, there is nothing else to boast about, except that mahjong tiles, numbering one hundred and thirty-six, can actually cross the Eastern Sea and become popular in Europe and America. Isn't that something to be proud of? Originally, mahjong is a national treasure of China. Among the 450 million men and women compatriots in China, at least 300 million can play. I often say: Everyone says that education in China is not widespread enough, so most are illiterate, but this is a mistake. If they can't read, how can they recognize the East, South, West, North, Middle, Prosperity, Dragon, Phoenix, and the one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine of ten thousands on the mahjong tiles?</p>
<p>Among the important figures of the party-state, there are also many who are addicted to this game, and their bamboo combat techniques are also very exquisite. Especially a certain general who once dominated the two lakes, his mahjong skills can be called the best among the important figures of the party-state!</p>
<p>Apart from gambling, mahjong seems to have no other use, but the explanation of the XX department is that mahjong itself cannot be regarded as a prohibited item and can be transported without obstruction. This wonderful explanation is truly only known to heaven. We common people are really unfathomable and dare not guess! I have a friend who can look at mahjong with his eyes closed. He only needs to touch it with two fingers, as if he can see it. Moreover, he can look at all thirteen tiles upside down from beginning to end. This can indeed be said to be the Mahjong King!</p>
<h3 id="e199">By the Wusong River <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Renfang</p>
<p>"Hang yu! Hang yu..." A group of shirtless coolies are carrying goods that have just been transported from somewhere to the warehouse, constantly coming and going, going and coming again. The sweat on their bodies gushes out like the tide, and their mouths are constantly roaring in a miserable tone. For the sake of life, they have to work so hard. The water in the Wusong River, black in color, is hysterically surging. It is evaporated by the intense sunlight, and stirred by the breeze. A very fishy and foul odor quickly invades everyone's nostrils. It is awfully unpleasant....</p>
<p>Two or three Jiangbei children, with two terribly thin legs bare, shirtless, are digging here and there in the filthy mud by the riverbank, hoping to get something without cost. After a while, one child picks up a broken bowl, and another child picks up a silver coin. The child who picks up the silver coin continues to dig with a triumphant smile. The child who picks up the broken bowl is crying, but he is still working hard, hoping to pick up something more valuable than a silver coin. People's hearts are the fiercest, especially the hearts of poor people.</p>
<p>The boatman who shakes the boat is desperately holding the long oar with force, turning left and right as he shakes it, singing various vulgar and obscene mountain songs in his mouth, while smiling. The songs they sing do not have the bravery or sadness of the Song of the Volga Boatmen. The evening glow in the sky is presented in the boundless clouds, with red and yellow, how bright and beautiful, but soon, you will be invaded by the black devil and destroy your body. The water in the Wusong River is hysterically surging.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Stinking for Ten Thousand Years <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Momin</p>
<p>Yesterday I passed a door on the road, and the white curtains of filial piety showed that someone must have died, but there was only a middle-aged woman crying in the curtains, and the rest were making noise at the door, and they were all pinching their noses and shaking their heads. Perhaps it was the hot weather and the corpse was stinking, which is also a very normal thing, but the others were discussing it, saying that this person had fallen to his death in a latrine, so the stench was overflowing, even after washing, the stench was not gone.</p>
<p>It is said that this person was very good and very honest during his lifetime. He moved from Jiangbei to Jiangnan more than ten years ago and never quarreled with anyone, so the neighbors nearby praised him. One day, he suddenly did not return all night. It was thought that he was socializing at a friend's house, but unexpectedly, a dead person was found in the latrine at the entrance of the alley. The crowd went to watch and found that it was the middle-aged woman's husband, so sadness came from it.</p>
<p>"Stinking for ten thousand years" and "becoming famous for hundreds of generations" are two sentences, one is cursing people, and the other is flattering people. If someone is a great traitor and cunning, doing all kinds of evil, they should be stinking for ten thousand years. If someone has a pure heart, they are cursed for stinking for ten thousand years, but those treacherous people are flattered with becoming famous for hundreds of generations. It is really confusing, no wonder the society is getting darker and darker.</p>
<p>The person who fell and died in the latrine, although the appearance is unbearably stinking, the heart is very pure. Rather than praising Zhang San and Li Si for becoming famous for hundreds of generations, it is better to praise the person in the latrine. Black and white can still be distinguished, but they spent money to buy the praises of becoming famous for hundreds of generations, but in fact they will be stinking for tens of thousands of years.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The weather is extremely hot, and people's hearts are also becoming irritable. When encountering an impetuous person, the heat above ninety degrees makes their heart feel like it's on fire, unbearably impatient. If an impetuous person encounters a slow-paced person, they often show a reckless expression before the other person finishes speaking, leading to many jokes. I've recorded some of them...</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang saw his tenant farmer being escorted into the city by the police, with iron chains clanking, which was quite pitiful. Mr. Zhang said, "Amu Lin, what crime have you committed?" The tenant farmer said, "I committed theft." "Amu Lin, that's not good. What did you steal from someone?" "Sir, I didn't steal anything, I only picked up a piece of straw rope." Mr. Zhang angrily said, "The current criminal law is too harsh. You only picked up a piece of straw rope, and they shouldn't be escorting you into the city like they're capturing a major thief." The tenant farmer said, "I haven't finished speaking. I only picked up a piece of straw rope, and the rope was tied to someone's cow. So I led it to my own home."</p>
<p>A young man dragged an old man to the court to file a complaint, saying that the old man scolded him loudly, bordering on insult, so he sued him. The official asked the old man, "What authority do you have to scold a young man? What kind of person are you?" The old man slowly replied, "I am a country person." The official angrily said, "So you are a country bumpkin! You are not related to the young man, so how can you insult him?" The old man said, "Don't be angry, Your Honor, let me finish my explanation. I am a country person and don't recognize hunchbacks, calling them 'swollen backs.' It is natural for elders to instruct juniors, and it shouldn't be considered an insult."</p>
<p>In an era of "national extravagance showing frugality," adults and gentlemen often dress like old country people. If you "only judge people by their clothes," it's easy to make a fool of yourself. Especially police officers, they wouldn't dare to lightly criticize someone without knowing their background. One night, a person in plain clothes was walking on the road. A police officer stepped forward and inquired about their profession. The person said, "I am the Prime Minister." The police officer quickly stood at attention and saluted, assuming that someone calling themself the Prime Minister must be a Grand Scholar from the former Qing Dynasty or the Premier of the Republic of China. The person slowly said, "Hold on, don't salute yet. I haven't finished speaking. I am a boatman, one who has a 'Prime Minister's belly that can hold a boat.'"</p>
<p>During the New Life Movement era, the waiters in hotels didn't dare to judge social status by clothing. One day, a country bumpkin came to book a room. The waiter smiled ingratiatingly and asked the guest's profession. The person said, "I am a King." The waiter was greatly surprised, knowing that "King" was a nickname for a major capitalist. Whether it was the Steel King, the Petroleum King, or the Flour King, being called a King meant they had at least tens of millions in assets. So, he was very cautious and did his best to flatter the person. The person laughed and said, "Stop flattering me, I haven't finished speaking. I am an incense keeper in the King's Temple."</p>

<p>Chapter Thirty-One: Three Battles in the White-Clad Charge Through the Snow Formation; The Entire Battalion Sacrifices, Red-Eyed, Into the Gunfire</p>
<p>Zi Qiang heard clearly that the sound of footsteps had passed four or five hundred meters. Then, estimating the enemy's distance, he ordered the machine gunners to begin firing. "Rat-tat-tat," the bullets hit the back of the enemy's column. They were walking in a column, not yet dispersed, and they suddenly encountered the enemy from behind. This was something they never dreamed of. Moreover, the village was already close ahead, and if they continued forward, they would certainly be attacked from that side as well. At this moment, a rushing sound suddenly arose in the enemy's formation, probably because they were running around in the snow. This unexpected attack would cause even heavenly soldiers and generals to panic, especially since some of the traitors were forced to come along, making them even more flustered. They turned around and followed up with a counterattack from the gully. When they counterattacked in this way, the defenders in the village knew that they had fallen into a trap and also fired at their line. The enemy commander knew that in this narrow terrain, they could not divide their forces to face the enemy on both sides. Therefore, he immediately ordered the invaders to disperse, lie down, and stop the counterattack. Zhao Ziqiang, on the gully above, directed his brothers to fire a volley, seeing that the enemy's bullets were returning erratically, high and low, clearly indicating scattered formations, and likely causing many casualties. After the enemy returned fire for a while, they retreated eastward and suddenly fell silent. If they were to continue shooting blindly, it would be a waste of bullets. In the troops outside the pass, losing a bullet was like losing a drop of blood, and it was not easy to get supplies. Therefore, Ziqiang also stopped shooting, using the bayonet of his rifle to raise a small white flag, waving it a few times towards the opposite bank. A platoon leader on the other side understood and also had a white object waving in the low air. So, Ziqiang led his brothers along the gully, slowly walking forward. The enemy, knowing that they had fallen into an ambush, did not expect the ambush to be only a company. Therefore, although they had retreated to the high ground east of the gully entrance, they were determined not to let the Chinese army get any closer to them. Ziqiang's company pressed forward, causing a slight disturbance. The enemy on that side, forced into this position, could not remain calm and also used machine guns to sweep the gully, while using the small cannons they had brought to bombard the distant village at the same time.

<p>Australian Crawford, the defending Wimbledon champion, defeated American Davis Cup player Stephens in a highly watched competition. Both sides had exceptionally powerful serves, and both struggled to counter each other. Stephens' control over his shots and speed especially amazed the audience. However, when Stephens led 5-4 in the third set, he suddenly collapsed, losing three consecutive games and the match. Crawford's victory was particularly commendable, as doctors had advised him not to participate. After the match, he had to be helped into the dressing room, completely exhausted. During the match, Crawford often showed signs of fatigue.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Shields Defeats Austin <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>

Austin then took the lead again at 5-4. At this point, Shields unleashed serves like cannonballs, tying the score again. Shields broke Austin's serve and ultimately won 7-5, ending the match in a sliding four. In the final game, Shields' shots deep into the corner and a cannonball serve were very impressive.</p>

<p>British Vines eliminated American Davis Cup player Lott, performing completely out of character, far from his usual brilliance. His victory over Lott was not due to his skill but entirely due to his stamina. Vines won the first set 6-4, lost the second set 2-6, and then won the final two sets 7-5, 10-8. In the fourth set, Lott led 5-2, but then suddenly became overwhelmed, succumbing to exhaustion and suffering a miserable defeat.</p>

<p>American Wood easily defeated South African Kappel. He only lost the third set due to playing too fancy. In the final set, Wood was overwhelming, winning all six games. Kappel's defeat was marked by countless double faults. The overall score was 6-1, 6-4, 3-6, 6-0.</p>

<p>Since establishing the warm-water swimming pool, the Chinese Swimming Research Association has been dedicating itself to finding a suitable location for construction in order to realize the dream of cultivating talent. After more than a year of negotiations in four districts, no suitable site has been found. The Association is determined not to stop progress due to the lack of a suitable location. Especially since summer has arrived, it is truly the best time for swimming. After discussions with the Wanguo Swimming Pool (formerly Lan Yuan) on Avenue Messimy in the French Concession, they have agreed to cooperate in improving the swimming pool. The entire pool will be constructed with cement, making it sturdy and clean. The water will be changed every two days, making it extremely hygienic. Furthermore, there will be instructors stationed permanently to provide guidance, a major improvement compared to last year. For the benefit of members' enjoyment of rights and the promotion of swimming, the pool will be open daily from 6:00 AM to midnight, 18 hours a day, until October 1st, exclusively for members' practice. The procedures are simple. All official members of the Association can bring their membership receipt and a two-inch photo, along with miscellaneous fees of one yuan, to exchange for a membership card at the Association's office at 115 Hankou Road (formerly No. 9), second floor, any day this week from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The telephone numbers are 13734 and 52488. Temporary memberships are also welcome. A long-term pass costs only eight yuan, limited to 300 people. Those who wish to participate are encouraged to register promptly to avoid disappointment.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Ministry of Education Inspector Zhong Daozan Reports on Key Points for Improving Vocational Education in Anhui Province <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Three hours of instruction per week, with Chinese, mathematics, English, etc., for three years. Zhong's educational situation. This inspection report has been submitted to the Ministry of Education. The points regarding the urgent need for improvement in vocational education in the province are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e224">A. Regarding General Matters <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>1.  Most school principals are not agricultural or industrial professionals, nor do they have excellent experience in vocational education, which clearly does not comply with regulations. A strict assessment should be conducted, and those who are unqualified and have no achievements in their work must be replaced and qualified personnel carefully selected to take over in order to improve the situation.</p>
<p>2.  The practical training equipment in each school, such as farms, mulberry gardens, factories, silkworm rearing rooms, etc., is either too small to be used or the facilities are too simple to facilitate teaching. Their scope should be expanded and their content enriched to achieve practical results. If limited by funding and unable to increase the budget, the number of classes should be reduced according to the situation, or some or all of the student enrollment should be temporarily suspended and the remaining funds transferred to teaching equipment.</p>
<p>3.  The practical training material fees for each school are mostly insufficient and the budget should be increased in accordance with regulations.</p>
<p>4.  The teaching in each school mostly focuses on lectures, with very little time spent on practical training. Most schools also learn before practicing and the practical training time for each academic year gradually increases. Some practical training sessions only last two hours. All these methods are inconsistent with the regulations and should be improved as soon as possible.</p>
<p>5.  Most students in each school are focused on higher education, but in reality, they often lack economic capacity. In order to adapt to the environment, schools often increase the types of general subjects and teaching hours, which is inconsistent with the purpose of vocational schools. Focus should be placed on skill-based subjects to cultivate sufficient production capacity in order to strengthen students' belief in their profession.</p>
<p>6.  Students in each school produce a small number of products, and most of them are rough and of little commercial value. Even the better ones mostly imitate existing products on the market in terms of drawings, colors, and quality, lacking improvement and promotion of ideas.</p>
<p>7.  Schools in each area mostly close themselves off and have little contact with vocational organizations. They also provide little training in students' automatic management and entrepreneurial cooperation spirit.</p>
<p>8.  The teaching materials used in general subjects such as mathematics, Chinese, physics, and chemistry in each school cannot be linked to the vocational subjects being studied. The 20-minute break exercises each day should be held during practical work time to regulate students' physical and mental health, but the schools have not complied with this.</p>
<p>9.  The clothing, food, housing, and transportation of the faculty and staff in each school mostly fail to demonstrate the spirit of hard work and perseverance to serve as an example for the students. They also rarely live with the students.</p>
<p>10. Students in schools in northern Anhui are quite frugal and hardworking, but have not yet developed habits of hygiene, cleanliness, tidiness, and labor.</p>
<p>11. Girls' vocational schools in the province provide meals and accommodation at the school to show preferential treatment, resulting in a large number of students. However, the concept of focusing on women's vocational training to cultivate the ability to be economically independent is still weak, often viewing it as a preparatory school for higher education.</p>
<p>The above points six to eleven should be improved.</p>
<h3 id="e225">B. Concerning Various Schools <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>1.  Provincial First Vocational School, (1) Practical training time for all departments: first year is the least, second year is slightly more, third year accounts for about one-quarter of the total time. The Applied Chemistry Department in the first year has no practical training in making finished products other than chemical experiments. They should be required to first manufacture simple commodities such as chalk, soap paste, etc., to increase practical work. For the practical skills of the current students in each grade, holiday periods should be used as much as possible to intensify long-term practical work to make up for the deficiency. (2) In order for Civil Engineering students to obtain practical experience, they should, during the summer vacation of the third academic year, request construction agencies to send them to various local public works bureaus for on-site learning. The Applied Chemistry and Mechanical Engineering departments should conduct one or two similar long-term production operations to achieve proficiency in skills. (3) To strengthen the foundation and proficiency of vocational skills, high school graduates can be recruited for five or six years of training. The first two years should focus on general training, with vocational training equally emphasized. The fifth and sixth years should have vocational training for three hours per week. All three years have excessive hours for Chinese, Mathematics, and English, which should be corrected. (5) Library equipment is incomplete, especially reference books for various vocational subjects.</p>
<p>2.  Provincial First Girls' Vocational School, (1) The practical training equipment for each department is very simple. The silkworm rearing and silk-making facilities are narrow, leaky, and dirty, making them unsuitable. The vacant land outside the facilities also lacks cleanliness. (2) Except for the Sericulture Department, the practical training time is less than one-quarter of the total time. Embroidery Department drawing is eight hours per week. All departments have English subjects arranged, which are inappropriate. (3) The achievements in embroidery and dyeing are mostly crude, except for a small portion that is still presentable. The patterns and colors are inferior to existing products on the market. Attention should be paid to research on fresh colors and styles. (4) Students throughout the school are more interested in general academic subjects than in vocational subjects, which urgently needs to be corrected.</p>
<p>3.  Provincial Second Vocational School, (1) The commercial department's practical training equipment only has five English typewriters and a small school store. The learning time each week is also very limited. If the number of typewriters cannot be increased temporarily, after-school, evening, and weekend holidays should be used to intensify learning in rotating groups and should be concentrated for learning, not extended to two years, which would lead to inefficient learning. (5) Considering the environment of Wuhu, there is no need to run advanced commerce. It should be changed to junior commerce and commercial tutoring, and should also include old-style bookkeeping, attention to calligraphy in advertisement, abacus calculation, and commodity research, etc., to seek practicality. (3) Agricultural equipment is very simple, and there is no new-style agricultural tool or agronomy practice. There is only rice cultivation and horticulture, only ordinary vegetables, with nothing to improve or promote. The original farmland area is not extensive, and the practice is only eleven hours per week. Students' work habits have not yet been developed.</p>
<p>4.  Provincial Seventh Vocational School, (1) The school building of the second division was converted from the Water Conservancy Bureau. The rooms are small and very unsuitable. The dyeing and leather-making factories are very simple in equipment. Often two or three people share one machine, taking turns to learn, and the time is very uneconomical. (2) The leather-making achievements are very crude, almost unsalable. The products that are better and can be sold often have excessive losses. The dyeing and weaving products are also very scarce. (3) Because the school's material costs are insufficient, each sheet of cowhide is often divided into three or four sheets for group learning. The cowhide that has been divided is often unable to be sold. (4) The school has a total of six classes in two departments. This year's enrollment should be suspended once, and all funds from the two classes, about ten thousand yuan, should be allocated for equipment, or concentrate financial resources to run the Applied Chemistry Department specifically, dividing it into two groups: leather making and leather goods. The dyeing and weaving equipment should be converted into a vocational supplementary department. (1) For students in existing classes who lack sufficient practice, the method of the aforementioned Provincial First Vocational School can be referred to for handling.</p>
<p>5.  Provincial Fourth Vocational School, (1) The mulberry garden is forty mu, and the farmland owned and rented is only thirty-four mu in total. Recently, the Department of Education allocated funds to purchase farmland, which is currently being negotiated. In the past, there were no achievements to speak of. (2) There is no new-style agricultural equipment, and the facilities are simple, so they urgently need to be purchased. (3) Nurseries, wheat fields, vegetable gardens, etc., still need to be intensified for management, and the amount of production is also small. (4) Student dormitories are very unclean, and clothes and bedding are also too dirty.</p>
<p>6.  Private Anhui Vocational School, (1) The school's mechanical and dyeing departments both have quite suitable equipment. Compared with the existing number of students and practical training equipment, each can still add more than twenty people. Vocational supplementary classes or dozens of apprentices should be recruited to specialize in production and business, and to provide vocational supplementary education. (2) After the opening of the Wuhu Zha Road, more people apply to the school for mechanical engineering than for dyeing, and some request to pay their own expenses. (3) The school’s lectures and practical training each account for half, and the allocation is still appropriate. However, among the courses taught, English, mathematics, Chinese, etc., account for too much, and vocational subjects are too few. (4) The school has a good foundation, but it lacks funds abnormally. In addition to the Department of Education’s annual subsidy of 13,000 yuan, there is almost no other income. It should be brought under the Department's management or raise more funds for expansion. (5) The women's simplified department graduates in one year, studying sewing, embroidery, and weaving. The time is short and the subjects are numerous. Although practical results are achieved, the time limit should be extended, and it should be divided into two groups, sewing and embroidery, and weaving, and renamed the Women's Junior Vocational Department or recruit older illiterate women to run a home arts vocational supplementary class.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Chinese Marine Biological Society <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Actively Researching Production and Education</p>
<p>Marine organisms have great value both academically and economically. However, the Chinese people have historically not conducted research on marine organisms and passively watched as strong neighbors fish and collect their benefits in Chinese waters. Those with aspirations for research, aware of this, established the Chinese Marine Biological Society in Xiamen five years ago, dedicated to researching marine organisms and promoting knowledge of marine biology. Since its establishment, with the assistance of the China Cultural Fund Society and the American Rockefeller Foundation, and in cooperation with Xiamen University, many domestic biology experts have been invited to Xiamen during past summer holidays to conduct surveys and research on local marine organisms. As for this year's association affairs, they have been expanded slightly compared to the past, and are being conducted in three areas:</p>
<p>(1) Summer research on marine specialties of the coastal Qingdao and Xiamen areas of our country. This year, in addition to continuing cooperation with Xiamen University, it has also been invited to join in cooperation by the newly established Qingdao Marine Biology Research Institute. Therefore, this year's summer research will be conducted simultaneously in Qingdao and Xiamen. The summer research session will be from July 8th to August 18th. The biology experts invited to participate in the research in Qingdao include Professor Dai Lisheng of Tsinghua University (Protozoa), Professor Zhang Feng of the National Peiping Research Institute (Mollusks), and Professor Lu Dingheng (Pseudomollusks), Professor Zhang Chunlin of the Peiping Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute (Fish), and Professor Li Liangqing (Algae), Professor Zhang Kui of Qilu University (Coelenterates), and Professor Xu Yinqi of Soochow University (Parasitology). Those going to Xiamen have invited Professor Tang Peisong of Wuhan University (Physiology), Professor Zheng Zuoxin of Fuzhou Union University (Embryology), Professor Zhu Xi of Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University (Embryology), Professor Chen Tongbai of the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of the Guangdong Construction Department (Fish), Professor Chen Xintao of Lingnan University (Parasitology), Professor Wu Zhaofa of Henan University (Animal Morphology), Professor Huang Wenfeng of Xiamen Jimei College (Fisheries), and Professor Chen Ziying of the Biology Department of Xiamen University, Lin Shaowen, and others.</p>
<p>(2) Summer Marine Biology Remedial Class is jointly organized by the Association and the Biology Department of Xiamen University, specifically for science teachers in secondary schools. This class focuses on field observation. If this year's results are satisfactory, it will continue to be established in the future.</p>
<p>(3) Annual Research is planned to be conducted at the coastal biological museum of Xiamen University. The candidates have not yet been determined. However, the research problems must have considerable economic value. Although the Association is a purely academic organization, it also thinks about contributing to domestic production.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Shandong Students' Military Training Begins, More Than 2,000 Students Are Armed <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Han Fuqu Holds Meeting for Training</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) More than 2,000 high school students in the province are concentrated in Jinan, Yidu, and Yanzhou for military training. Students from various places arrived at the designated locations by armored train or long-distance bus. More than 230 students from Qingdao Shandong University also arrived in Yidu by armored train today (1st) to join the army. Training will begin tomorrow (2nd). Those concentrated in Jinan are organized into two battalions. The first battalion is at Qilu Middle School in Dongguan, and the second battalion is at Qilu University in Nanguan. The students live in the dormitories of the two schools. The students of Qilu University who had an earlier vacation have gone home, and will return to school successively today and tomorrow. The students have been divided into battalions, companies, and platoons yesterday and have assembled once to be taught basic movements, commands, and etiquette by the training officers. After entering the dormitory, roll call is taken, and they are not allowed to go out. Each officer uses military law to restrain them, which is very strict. The main office buildings are temporarily used as battalion headquarters. Each room in the dormitory houses three people, completely using the floor as a bed, with one mattress and one sheet per person. Some bring pillows, but the battalion commander does not allow it, ordering them to take off their shoes and socks every night and wrap them in a bundle to use as pillows. There are only toiletries in the room, nothing else. It is extremely simple and completely militarized. This morning (1st), the Military Training Committee issued military uniforms and symbols, and everyone was fully armed for a time. From 1:30 pm to 3:00 pm, they assembled for training. After dinner, from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm, they still assembled for training. All basic movements have already been practiced by the students at school, so retraining is easier. Only those with improper posture are corrected. Because the provincial governor Han Fuqu is scheduled to assemble all the students undergoing training at the Provincial Sports Field at 7:00 am tomorrow (2nd) for a speech, a rehearsal of saluting postures and marching movements was conducted today, and there will be a grand occasion at that time. Guns will also be issued for practice.</p>
<h3 id="e228">A Large Batch of Principals of Anhui Provincial Secondary Schools Will Be Replaced <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>(Anhui News) The Anhui Department of Education, in accordance with the order of the Ministry, plans to formulate a plan to improve secondary schools, reorganize provincial secondary schools, separate normal schools, vocational specialties, and change school names according to place names. Therefore, this year's replacement of principals of provincial secondary schools will be more than in the past. Those vying for the position of principal are already plentiful. It is said that the announcement period will be in mid-July.</p>

<p>All Proposals and Papers to be Sent to the Society Before September</p>
<p>The China Cooperative Society issued a notice stating that the Society, through the resolution of the Third Executive Committee, will convene the Fourth Members' Congress, and through the resolution of the First Meeting of the Society, it has been decided to hold it at the new Society headquarters in the capital for four consecutive days starting on October 7th. It is hoped that all comrades will take time out of their busy schedules to attend and jointly promote the cooperative cause in our country. It is greatly anticipated. All proposals or papers to be presented at the meeting should be sent to the Society before September 10th for organization. However, the intention of the proposals must be appropriate to actual needs, the reasons must be concise, and the methods must be thorough and easy to implement. As for the papers, they should provide materials for discussion in the various group discussion meetings at the meeting, and the scope is limited to four areas: cooperative laws and regulations, cooperative insurance, cooperative practices, and cooperative education. The content should be based on national conditions and facilitate implementation. If there are actual experiences that merely list various difficult problems for submission to the various group discussion meetings, they are also welcome. However, the difficult circumstances of each problem must be explained systematically, and the nature of the problem must be able to be incorporated into any one of the above four discussion areas and be relatively important. All of these aspects are the key points to which this Congress pays special attention. It is hoped that you will be informed. Regarding special prices for train and ship travel for members attending the meeting, we have respectively consulted with the Ministry of Railways and Communications to provide preferential treatment. In addition to separate letters of notification, we will issue another notice and hope that you will fill in each item listed on the reply slip immediately after receiving this Society's notice and send it to the Society to facilitate preparation.

<p>The Work Plan Has Been Approved by the Social Education Council</p>
<p>The Sixth Jiangsu Province People's Education District discussed livelihood education at this Social Education Research Conference and approved a plan to take the promotion of cooperative undertakings as the central work of livelihood education. The original plan is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e235">Introduction <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The implementation of people's education should start with livelihood education. Observing our country's society, this has been generally recognized by us and there is an urgent need in fact. All educational facilities that benefit livelihood, such as the improvement of production technology, the promotion of excellent varieties, the advocacy of rural sideline occupations, the regulation of civilian finance, and everything else, people's education agencies are doing their best to make the undertaking universal and to seek rapid efficiency. Although there are many undertakings and it is difficult to do everything at once, funds and talents are often insufficient. For the present, the key is to have a single goal, organize the people as the object of education, observe their common economic needs, and engage in the improvement of production. Then, taking the promotion of cooperative undertakings as an important method of implementing livelihood education, everyone will be benefited.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Basic <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>(A) Taking the basic education area as the starting area for cooperative undertakings, promoting industrial cooperation methods (1) Regarding the agricultural or industrial situation of the basic education area, select a widespread and beneficial undertaking, investigate its production and sales situation, and design and promote improvement, that is, take guiding the organization of cooperative societies as the experimental center and train its members. (2) The affairs of the cooperative society shall be handled by full-time personnel sent by the guiding agency to assist in the handling, so as to reduce the burden of the cooperative society and gradually enable it to operate independently, and a considerable percentage may be stipulated under the people's education undertaking fund for the promotion of cooperative undertakings. (3) In addition to the elected officials, the cooperative society should recruit trainees to undertake the actual training of cooperation, so as to cultivate the backbone of promoting cooperative undertakings in the area. The food allowances for trainees are borne by the guiding agency. (4) Before the business of the cooperative society is developed, it can be divided into several periods in a year, and operated in stages according to the needs of the members. (5) The business of the cooperative society should be mainly based on the common needs of the members. Credit, purchase, transportation, sales, utilization, and other businesses are all methods and conditions for completing industrial cooperation, and help the implementation of production cooperation, but there must be a fixed business center, so that each business has a chain relationship, in order to avoid danger. (6) Set a suitable period to hold training courses for members to receive livelihood education. (7) Based on the cooperative situation of the members, conduct precise economic surveys and statistics to guide the members in preparing an annual income and expenditure budget, in order to seek the improvement and improvement of the members' lives in terms of knowledge. The guiding agency should jointly handle various educational undertakings for training members with the business committee of the cooperative society.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Promotion <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>(B) The cooperative undertakings in the promotion area should be factually linked to the cooperative center organization in the basic education area, and the methods are as follows: (1) Assign qualified personnel trained in the basic education area to the promotion area to take responsibility for promotion. (2) The cooperative societies in the promotion area independently organize their nature and purpose, which must be the same as the cooperative societies in the basic education area in whole or in part. (3) The cooperative society in the promotion area obtains the corporate members of the cooperative society in the basic education area, or the cooperative societies in the promotion area jointly organize a cooperative society union with the cooperative societies in the basic education area. (4) The guiding agency, which unifies the promotion of cooperative undertakings in the education area in the form of a union, applies most of its strength to the union to seek the universality of educational efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="e240">The Road of the Mass Language Movement <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Xingzhi</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Yuzhi's explanation of mass language is very good. I would like to suggest a correction of two words. Mass language is the language that represents the progressive consciousness of the masses. Mass writing is the writing that represents the progressive consciousness.</p>
<p>Mass language and mass writing must be united... united in degree, united in need, and united in consciousness.</p>
<p>When mass language and writing suit the level, needs, and consciousness of the masses, the reaction of the masses themselves is joy. Therefore, mass language and writing are the language and writing that the masses are happy to say, happy to hear, happy to write, and happy to read. This state of joy is the realm of art.</p>
<p>A month ago, I borrowed a reel of film from a film company and sent it to the countryside for public screening. We wanted to teach the farmers to read the instructions a few days before the screening. Although the instructions were written in vernacular Chinese, the local schoolteachers could not teach it, and the farmers could not read it. I had no choice but to rewrite a set of instructions to teach everyone. This was not easy. I had to revise the manuscript several times before I could barely complete it. According to the local schoolteacher, the instructions I finally wrote were still too difficult. But it was at least ten times easier than the original manuscript from the film company. This example shows that the vernacular Chinese that is currently circulating is simply replacing the "zhi hu zhe ye" of classical Chinese with "de ma a ya," adding some foreign grammar and the consciousness of some young masters and young ladies, new scholars, and doctors. In writing, this kind of vernacular Chinese is incomprehensible to the masses; in reading, it is unintelligible to the masses. We can see that there is a great dark curtain in the Chinese literary movement: vernacular Chinese is not united with mass language.</p>
<p>The masses live a life of symbolic poverty. But their need for symbols is an undeniable fact. Old women use knots to keep accounts. Farmers carve tree bark to express their emotions. Wild children write "wang ba dan" to scold people. Students in people's schools use phonetic symbols to replace characters they cannot write. This need can be further illustrated by a story. Once, a woman sent a letter to her husband. When the husband opened it, he saw that the paper was drawn with...</p>
<p>"A single circle, a double circle, a circle, a broken circle, a series of circles."</p>
<p>The husband could not understand it. A clever man pointed out the secret of the circles drawn by his wife and said...</p>
<p>"I wanted to send my love, but I had no way to send it, so I drew a few circles instead. The single circle is me. The double circle is you. The round circle is reunion. The broken circle is separation. And there are endless thoughts that I express by circling all the way to the end."</p>
<p>These examples indicate that there is a great deficiency in the lives of the masses. The masses do not have enough symbols for thought, symbols for emotion, and symbols for action... in short, they do not have enough symbols for life. The symbols of the masses are as meager as their bread. Those who exploit the masses' bread are also monopolizing the symbols needed for the masses' lives.</p>
<p>In this light, the mass language movement has two main paths to follow...</p>
<p>(1) Intellectuals participate in the life of the masses, and on the basis of the evolution of mass language, strive to write mass writing that unites language and writing;</p>
<p>(2) Popularize the symbols of life among the masses so that the masses themselves can create mass writing that unites language and writing.</p>
<p>Intellectuals who want to write mass writing must first learn mass language. They must worship the masses as teachers. Not enough! They must delve into the life of the masses, share their lives, and share their joys and sorrows. They must be soldiers in the ranks of the masses. Only when their own lives are integrated with the lives of the masses can they appreciate the joys and sorrows of the lives of the masses; only then can writing about the masses be writing about themselves, and writing about themselves be writing about the masses. If they disdain to worship the masses as teachers and refuse to be a private in the ranks of the masses, they will never write good mass writing.</p>
<p>What symbols should be popularized among the masses? Chinese characters? Phonetic symbols? Pinyin writing? My suggestion is to do all three: Chinese characters should be taught; phonetic symbols should be taught; and mass writing spelled out with phonetic symbols should be taught even more.</p>
<p>Chinese characters are the treasure of the scholar-officials. The masses must recognize this treasure in order to see through the mystery of the scholar-officials. There are eighty million people who can teach Chinese characters. Although Chinese characters themselves are difficult to learn, the large number of people who can teach these symbols is a great convenience for the promotion movement. I believe that it is enough to simply recognize Chinese characters. One way to help the masses recognize Chinese characters is with phonetic symbols. If the masses learn phonetic symbols, they can automatically use dictionaries, recognize new words, and pursue new knowledge. But we cannot stop there. We must immediately teach the masses to use phonetic symbols to record their own thoughts, feelings, and actions. We must immediately teach the masses to use phonetic symbols to write mass writing. Our purpose in teaching Chinese characters is to enable the masses to understand the China that is surrounded by Chinese characters; our purpose in teaching phonetic symbols, in a small sense, is to help them learn more Chinese characters, and in a large sense, is to use the method of cicada molting to create pinyin characters to replace Chinese characters, in order to produce pinyin mass writing.</p>
<p>When we are doing the work of popularizing written symbols, we should also promote vulgar written simplified Chinese characters, unify printed and handwritten fonts, and unify standard and cursive scripts, in order to save learning time and energy.</p>
<p>Students in primary and secondary schools and people's schools should all become little teachers, each teaching at least two illiterate people. In this way, we will have more than ten million organized people to take on the important task of popularizing symbols. In addition, with the further cultivation and general mobilization of the eighty million literate masses, within a few years, the masses will be able to obtain the symbols they need for life.</p>
<p>When the masses obtain symbols, they will be able to describe their lives in detail. There will be literary geniuses in the ranks of the masses. They will naturally produce first-class mass writing.</p>
<p>When we transmit written symbols to the masses, we must do a "filtering" job. We must filter out outdated ideas, filter out numbing toxins, filter out the classics, and filter out foreign grammar. The symbols we offer to the masses should be like clean water without microorganisms. When the masses obtain these clean water symbols, they will be able to freely, without prejudice, write true mass writing.</p>
<p>I would like to point out that mass language must be based on a living language. The living language that three-quarters of the Chinese can understand is filtered Mandarin Chinese. Mandarin Chinese is also the most pleasant to listen to, and people are willing to learn it. Therefore, Mandarin Chinese is indeed qualified to become the main component of mass language. But mass language should be bold. Any local dialects, and even foreign languages, that have a close relationship with the progressive life of the masses can be absorbed as much as possible. We do not need to suspend an abstract and subjective standard and forcibly take or discard them. Let the masses choose for themselves. Those that do not suit the taste of the progressive masses will be naturally eliminated, and we do not need to worry too much.</p>
<p>The masses with progressive consciousness should lead the masses with backward consciousness to improve their lives... improve their level, improve their needs, and improve their consciousness. In this way, mass language can continue to improve, and mass writing will follow it and continue to improve.</p>

<h3 id="e242">Good News for Readers! <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Lu</p>
<p>I remember the day I saw the brochure of the China Dental Protection Association at a friend's house, which also had several red characters printed on it noting the cost. At that time, my friend was suffering from a toothache, so we discussed it and decided to join the association at the same time. The membership fee was paid to the Shanghai Bank designated by the association to collect it. I myself did not spend any money (because the association's articles stipulate that the introducer can join as an equal member for free) and became a member, which brought me many benefits. I think the association is willing to provide universal service, and since it has been sent to all walks of life, many people must have seen this brochure. However, this preferential method will end on July 10th. I hope you will join the association as soon as possible, so that you can also share the benefits. The address of the association is on the third floor of No. 47 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Jiangxi Road, Shanghai. The editor notes that the association's organization is purely service-oriented, so all the benefits for members are very preferential. Mr. Gao Feng introduced eight friends to the association, and also joined for free at the same time, and has a considerable understanding and goodwill towards the association, which is by no means comparable to empty publicity. I think that in the current high tide of the New Life Movement, the importance of dental care is already stipulated in the implementation of the convention. However, the people's economy is already so depressed, and to get the proper method of dental protection, it is necessary to join the association. However, the effective period of this preferential method is very short. If you intend to join, I hope you will do so as soon as possible, and do not miss this good opportunity!</p>
<h3 id="e243">Regarding Jin Shengtan's Annotated Water Margin (Part 1) <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yangling</p>
<p>In the "Trends" on June 30th, there is an article by Mr. Er Ye, "On the Emergence and Growth of Vernacular Chinese." I agree with the main idea of ​​the full text, but I have a slightly different opinion from Mr. Er Ye on the section about Jin Shengtan's annotation of Water Margin. This issue is worth discussing, so I will also talk about it.</p>
<p>First, let's look at Mr. Er Ye's original text...</p>
<p>For example, "Water Margin" is a famous novel, the result of many years of struggle in suffering, and its most valuable point is that it is written in spoken language. However, what did our Master Jin Shengtan say? He said that this is a "talented scholar's book," and he insisted on putting it together with Zuo Shi and Zhuang Sao! And there is something in the book that does not resemble the consciousness of the noble group - the robbers are not born bad people, but the official masters are bad people, forcing people to become robbers - he simply could not bear it. So he tampered with it, he wanted to "seal Hangu Pass with mud pills," he insisted on creating some "profound meanings and great righteousness" and "Spring and Autumn Annals writing style" in the book. In my opinion, Jin Shengtan put Water Margin and Zuo Shi and Zhuang Sao together and respected it as a "talented scholar's book," there was no malice in it, but a very correct view, just like the current critics value the novels that describe rickshaw pullers. As for "talented scholar's book," it is just a common term used by the Ming people, just like today's people often say "genius" and "great man." If Jin Shengtan used the "consciousness of the noble group" to select books, he would never have selected Water Margin. Moreover, he selected Water Margin and cut the complete one hundred and twenty chapter version, which was purely a series of stories, into seventy chapters. This is a purposeful work, the purpose of which is to expose the darkness of bureaucratic politics, point out the social causes of the Liangshanbo group, and praise the righteousness of the vagrant class. He ridiculed Song Jiang, who was written as very loyal and righteous in the story and only hoped to be recruited, to nothing. May I ask what kind of consciousness is this? In the fifty-first chapter of Water Margin, when writing about the uncle-brother-in-law of Gao Qiu's uncle bullying people, Jin Shengtan wrote...</p>
<p>Gao Qiu can do anything, but it can still be limited... Gao Qiu's uncle-brothers can do anything, how can it be limited? Gao Qiu's uncle-brothers can do anything, but it can still be limited; Gao Qiu's uncle-brothers also have relatives, and they can do anything again, how can it be limited? Gao Qiu's uncle-brothers also have relatives and can do anything again, but it can still be limited; Gao Qiu's uncle-brothers' relatives must also have their jackals and dogs running around, and they must all be able to do anything, how can it be limited? Alas! The world is the world of the court, and the people are the children of the court; now, if we allow unlimited tigers and wolves to open their unlimited greedy mouths, to seize unlimited muscles, to fill unlimited valleys, and want the people not to rebel and the country not to perish, how can we get it! "</p>
<p>This paragraph illustrates the unlimited exploitation under bureaucratic politics and its inevitable consequences, how can it be said to be out of the "consciousness of the noble group?"</p>

<p>— Pu Feng</p>
<p>"Stop! Walk to the right!" As I walked past that distinguished compatriot, I not only heard this voice, but also received a push from his distinguished hand.</p>
<p>"What? What do you do?" I opened my eyes wide; watching my friend, wearing an inverted collar, passed the customs first, unwilling, and walked to the left again.</p>
<p>Thank God, learning two sentences of foreign language did work after all, and this time I was not blocked. This made me understand the great truth of why everyone has to desperately learn two sentences of foreign language.</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>Get off the ship.</p>
<p>At the pier, I was stopped by the inspectors, but I was not inspected. I thought it was due to the inverted collar on my body, and I was quite proud. When I got on the ship, it did not start at the departure time shown on the sign. I felt strangely anxious sitting there waiting.</p>
<p>"Woo woo!" The whistle sounded, but the ship did not move. I only saw a red-haired devil leading a group of majestic, ragged comrades, holding inspection equipment in their hands.</p>
<p>"Open the box! Quickly!" An extremely urgent order.</p>
<p>"Student, there is nothing in it," I replied.</p>
<p>"Quickly! Open, ......"</p>
<p>I had to open it. I saw him touching with both hands and looking down with his eyes. There was nothing to blackmail, so he became polite... "Sorry! Doing things for the public, I have to look!"</p>
<p>The inspector went aside.</p>
<p>"Open it quickly! ... Use a knife."</p>
<p>A student's leather suitcase tied with a rope was actually cut open, and the things were taken out one by one.</p>
<p>He left. The student showed a mourning face, stepping on the box with his feet because it could not be covered due to his turning it over, and his eyes were spitting fire.</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>"For my own viewing, not a commodity, ......" A group of people surrounded a student, he said this in incorrect Mandarin.</p>
<p>"Erotic pictures! Prohibited items, ... Go ashore!" A threatening situation.</p>
<p>"For my own viewing, ......"</p>
<p>"Five dollars, quickly!"</p>
<p>"Less please!" A pleading voice.</p>
<p>In the end, the inspector walked away again, with three Hong Kong dollars newly put in his pocket.</p>
<p>The ship has not yet started, but the inspector has gone to another place. The student who was blackmailed was saying words to comfort himself, such as I originally planned to go ashore to see the old foreigners, such as I really wanted to tear it up immediately, such as ......, turning his head, I saw that he secretly tore up the remaining two erotic pictures in his hand.</p>
<p>Notice to Mr. Pu Feng... "From Guangzhou to Shanghai" manuscript, since it is known by letter that it has been published in another publication, it will be stopped tomorrow. As for whether the manuscript received by this publication is the one that Mr. Pu Feng "entrusted someone to find a place to publish and lost," please go to the editorial department of this publication to check the original manuscript.</p>
<p>Correction In yesterday's article by Mr. Wang Renshu, line 90, "as Mr. Hu Shih said," it was found that "Shih" was misprinted as "Yu," which was not corrected in time. We hereby correct it.</p>

<p>Financial Market Atmosphere Is Depressed</p>
<p>Although a portion of the banking sector has resumed operations yesterday, most are still within the closure period, and the market atmosphere has not fully recovered, so there is nothing to record. Although the money industry is operating as usual, it is unable to support itself alone, and the market atmosphere is still depressed. The foreign exchange market in the city was 5 points for both the morning and afternoon sessions, which was the same as the previous few days. The trading of bills was also quite dull. The morning session saw over 37 million in transfers and over 200,000 in new transactions, the afternoon session saw over 300,000 in transactions, the Small General Association saw over 200,000 in transactions, foreign mortgage transactions saw over 500,000 in redemptions, foreign public contracts saw over 37 million in collections and deliveries, and remittances from various routes totaled over 300,000. The small silver market has seen large fluctuations recently. Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver fell as soon as it opened in the morning, to 835 yuan. Although it rebounded by 2 yuan in the afternoon, to 837 yuan, the result was still 8 yuan lower than the previous day. Transactions were made for 4,000 jiao in the morning session and 6,500 jiao in the afternoon session. Guangdong small silver was relatively stable, with both the morning and afternoon sessions trading at 732.5 yuan, an increase of 1.8 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions were made for 40,000 jiao in the morning session and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Copper coins fell by 2,000 wen compared to the previous market, to 330,000 wen. The transaction consideration was 10,500 yuan, totaling 34,650 strings of wen.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Securities Market Environment Favorable, Popularity Strong, Last Week's Bond Market Lively and Rising <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>丨Transaction Volume of 92,166,000 Yuan丨</p>
<p>Last week, from June 25th to 30th, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, as the June futures contract had only one day remaining and the August futures contract began trading, along with the increased auction of 20-year Disaster Relief Public Bonds and 22-year Customs Treasury Bills, and the complete resolution of the transportation issue at this time, the market environment was particularly stable, and trading was extremely active. Although there were instances of heavy selling of No. 4 and No. 16 contracts, with substantial amounts involved, the market price was only temporarily slightly affected. As soon as the selling subsided, prices soared. The 23-year Customs Treasury Bills, with a total value of 100 million yuan, experienced a frenzy of buying upon initial auction, with prices soaring by four yuan, an unprecedentedly positive phenomenon for the initial listing of new bonds. This also serves as evidence of the confidence and interest various groups have in government bonds. Based on this strong and bullish sentiment, it is unlikely that the outlook will diminish quickly. Last week, Monday was the last day for the June futures contract, and the squeeze continued, with new high prices seen in the morning. The gold short contract surged by one yuan. On Tuesday, only the July futures contract was traded, and despite the selling of No. 4 contracts, the bullish momentum remained unabated, with new high prices again seen in the morning. In the afternoon, No. 4 contracts were heavily sold, totaling approximately 10 million yuan, causing a sharp drop in market prices, resulting in a relatively small decline of five or six jiao. On Wednesday, only the one-month futures contract was traded, but Disaster Relief Public Bonds began trading. Numbers 4 and other northern firms sold, while Numbers 38 and others made significant purchases, with mixed price movements, deemed stable. Thursday was dedicated to the settlement of June futures contracts, and the market was closed for the day. On Friday, August futures contracts began trading, and 23-year Customs Treasury Bills were added for spot and futures trading, with prices rising rapidly from the opening price of 78 yuan to 82 yuan in the first round, before trading was suspended. This was because only one seller, Number 46, existed, while dozens of other firms were in need of the contract, leading to the price soaring and the trading being halted. Other varieties also showed the dominance of bullish sentiment, with gains of six or seven jiao. On Saturday, trading was relatively mixed, with both gains and losses, but the trend remained upward, due to the upcoming three-day holiday, leading to some profit-taking to avoid risk. Overall, market prices rose by several jiao to 1.45 yuan for the week, with a total transaction volume of 92,166,000 yuan. The resulting gains and losses are listed in the comparative table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan). The market will resume normal trading today.</p>

<p>The yarn market is sluggish due to the sharp drop in American cotton, which has softened sentiment. However, buyers still rely on the hot weather, reduced shipments from factories, and thinner inventory compared to before, so they remain relatively stable and are not rushing to sell. Therefore, the market has not seen significant weakness, but sales to customers remain slow at 2 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Recent "Golden Rooster" Yarn Drops by About One Yuan <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the spot yarn market was characterized by a lack of buyers due to the sharp drop in American cotton.</p>
<p>Near-month contracts fell by 1.34 yuan. The decline was slightly less pronounced for contracts further out, but the overall mood was weak. As a result, each month's contract fell by 5, 6, 7, or 8 jiao. In the afternoon, reports indicated that spot yarn transactions were sluggish, and market prices remained flat. Each month's contract fell again by 2 or 4 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 29,050 bales. Sales included 450 bales from Yu Kang, 450 bales from Tong Fu, 1,100 bales from Yuan Da, 550 bales from Ming De, 650 bales from Jun Chang, 700 bales from Tong Xing, and 600 bales from Tong He, and 550 from Tai Chang. Purchases included 1,200 bales by Da Feng, 900 bales by Da Ji, 1,250 bales by Jin Chang, 550 bales by Ren Feng, 600 bales by Xie Cheng, 550 bales by Chong An, and 400 by Xin Cheng.

<p>The cotton market is very weak, and the decline is intensifying. The cotton-growing areas of America has received rain, which caused a sharp drop of 35 points, softening sentiment. However, the report also announced that new cotton in dry regions, as well as an increase of 1.5 gold units per quintal for imported cotton, equivalent to an increase of 1.5 yuan per dan, means that although American cotton fell sharply, the spot cotton market has not been greatly affected.</p>

<p>The spot flower market opened with increasingly weak conditions for old cotton. American cotton fell sharply by 35 points, causing a slight rise in selling pressure. However, some were partially offset by the announced increase in import duties on foreign cotton by 1.5 yuan per dan. As a result, old cotton fell by 5.5 jiao, and new cotton fell by 5 or 6 jiao. In the afternoon, the market remained flat, with old cotton falling another 1.5 jiao and new cotton remaining flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 90,300 dan. Sales included 2,900 dan from Da Fu, 1,800 dan from Sui Long, 2,900 dan from Jun Chang, 2,500 dan from Yi Chang, 6,000 dan from Chang Feng, 2,200 dan from Tong He, 4,500 dan from Yuan Xing Chang, 1,200 dan from Chang He, 1,400 dan from Yuan Tai, and 1,500 dan from Xie Sheng.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton weakened due to a lack of buyers, rain in drought-stricken areas, and German political news favoring sellers. As a result, spot prices fell by 35 points, and futures prices fell by 31 to 34 points. British cotton futures fell by 8 to 10 points. Indian cotton weakened due to profit-taking by bulls and rain in the west, with speculators selling. As a result, Pingguoer fell by 2 rupees 7.5 jiao, Aomula fell by 2.5 rupees, and Bairuoxi fell by 3.25 rupees. The original telegraph records are on the left (2nd of the month telegram).</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for all months showed signs of weakening, as quoted prices for foreign wheat in Chicago fell significantly by about 7 or 8 jiao. Although the weather in the local area remains scorching hot, heavy rain in the north has brought hope to Beijing and Tianjin. Moreover, non-industry factors seem to be losing momentum, and the inflated prices driven by speculative bulls must eventually be supported by real sales. The difficulty in boosting flour sales after a bumper harvest in the north was already expected. The lifelessness of Tianjin indicates that the inflated flour prices have already been set up for an inevitable fall. Therefore, after the market opened yesterday, bulls gradually began to give up. Major factories, such as Fuxin and Fufeng, also had to gradually hedge their sales due to slow sales. Rumors that the factories would be collecting warehouse rental fees further unnerved the bulls, causing the decline in near-term contracts to be more severe than that of distant contracts. The quoted price for spot flour in Tianjin yesterday was 2.215 yuan (previously 2.245 yuan), which is similar to the standard price in this city. As a result, this month's contracts fell by another 2.75 li, August's contracts fell by 2.25 li, September's contracts fell by 2 li, and October to December's contracts fell by 1.75 li.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Abundant Wheat Arrivals Cause Standard Prices to Soften <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a weak and spiritless trend in all months after opening in the morning and afternoon. Market prices in the producing areas have gradually softened, and arrivals of goods have been abundant. In this city, ships and vehicles are abnormally congested, gradually causing concerns about stockpiles. Abundant wheat arrivals must be balanced by brisk flour sales in order to regulate the market. However, currently, wheat is abundant while flour sales are sluggish, inevitably causing obstacles. Therefore, those with physical goods have been hedging their sales on the exchange. If factory demand remains weak, this situation will become increasingly difficult. As a result, prices for each month gradually declined after the market opened. However, there has been no rain in this city, and bulls still have some strength to resist, so the decline was not as dramatic as the previous day. As a result, the price of this month's contracts fell by 3 fen, September's contracts fell by 5 fen, and October and November's contracts fell by 4 fen. Due to stockpiles and sluggish sales, the price of spot wheat has fallen by 3 to 5 fen in the central market. High-quality wheat from Kaifeng and Suzhou is priced at 3.02 yuan, wheat from Xuzhou is priced at 3.03 yuan, wheat from Mingguang is priced at 3 yuan, and lower-quality wheat is priced at 2.99 yuan. Wheat from Bengbu is priced at 3 yuan, wheat from Daqiao is priced at 2.9 jiao, and lower-quality wheat is priced at 2.8 jiao. Wheat from Hankou and Nanjing is priced at 2.7 jiao, wheat from Linhuai Guan is priced at 3 yuan, and lower-quality wheat is priced at 2.99 yuan. Wheat from Wuhu is priced at 2.72 yuan, and lower-quality wheat is priced at 2.65 yuan. Wheat from Yaowan is priced at 3 yuan, wheat from Zhenjiang is priced at 2.84 yuan, and wheat from Danyang and Gaoyou is priced at 2.9 yuan. Fuxin took 20,000 bags, Fufeng took 5,000 bags, and Xinda took 2,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Abundant Local Wheat Harvest <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>丨Unseen in the Last Decade丨</p>
<p>This year's wheat harvest is the best in the last decade, especially in Shaanxi, where the abundance of goods along the Longhai Railway has no outlet. Therefore, industry insiders predict that this city will become a central hub. The recent types of wheat arriving here seem to confirm this, such as the eastward flow of wheat from Xinyang County and Hankou, the continuous southward flow from Xuzhou and Linhuai Guan, and the unprecedented abundance of wheat produced in southern and northern Anhui. Therefore, this year's wheat production will be more than enough to supply the needs of the factories in this city. Furthermore, non-industry individuals initially believed that the rise in American wheat meant that foreign wheat could not be imported to China, and that, based on past experiences, there was no way to address the situation without foreign wheat. On the surface, this seemed reasonable, but in reality, it was likely not the case. The vastness of China's agricultural land and the amount of production often exceed people's expectations. For example, soybeans were once relied on from the three northeastern provinces, but since the establishment of Manchukuo, that source has been cut off. Initially, those involved were concerned that a shortage would inevitably cause panic. But China was blessed, and there was a full harvest in Jinpu and Longhai, and the supply was more than enough, and the price also fell along with various other prices. This is a well-known fact, and it is generally acknowledged by those who understand the environment. Therefore, even if this year's wheat production is compared to the quantity of borrowed wheat in the past, it is likely to be higher. With this proportion, it is very clear that the price of wheat cannot be arbitrarily raised.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Lower Reach Rice Sales Stagnant, Prices Weak <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source estimated that more than 30 firms had arrived (approximately 5,000 shi of goods). Sentiment seemed to be watchful. Local shop demand suddenly turned stagnant, and demand from customers also tended to stop. The market currently shows a softening trend, mainly because sellers with more goods were willing to lower prices to sell quickly. However, some were unwilling to sell lightly due to the extremely dry weather, so the market situation became chaotic. Prices of thick and thin japonica rice fell by varying amounts, such as 1 jiao, 1.2 or 3 jiao. Du Yangjian and Yin Bian Yuan also moved according to the thoughts of individuals, so the general trend was the same as the japonica rice market, but the price drop was not as severe, only fluctuating by a few jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than ten firms arrived from various locations in the lower reaches. Due to the hot weather, few shops were open in the market, leading to weak demand. The market showed that early thin japonica rice prices were short by 1 or 2 jiao, white yuan was weak by a few fen, and yangjian dujian was slightly weaker, while prices for the port customer tip were level.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Inland Inquiries and Customer Coarse Rice <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for guest indica rice was sluggish, and the stock of guest indica foreign rice was sufficient. Guest indica rice continued to arrive in small quantities, and foreign rice was also returned from other ports. The tense situation in the market due to the drought has changed. Yesterday, due to the sluggishness of guest goods, prices fell. However, inland firms such as Wuxi and Zhejiang had inquiries about customer sales of machine-milled rice. There was also business on this street, with a total of 2,500 bags of Shashi coarse rice and Hunan machine-milled rice being transacted. This street also sold 500 bags of Xiaowen rice. The Fuzhou firm has been sluggish for a long time, and yesterday only 88 bags of coarse red rice were sold, and there were no other transactions. Therefore, although the market is currently weak, if customer sales are clear again today and tomorrow, it is feared that prices will have to be reduced again.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Tung Oil Market: Foreign Firms Actively Buying White Tung Oil <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>丨Domestic Sales Still Show No Signs of Momentum丨</p>
<p>Recently, white tung oil prices are reflecting activity from foreign firms during their half-year closing. There has been little activity in Hankou, with the end-of-month traded price at 29.3 yuan. After adding 29.6 yuan in foreign regulations, there were 200-300 tons of transactions. Traders opened at 23.78 yuan for Xiang tung and 23.56 yuan for Southern branch, both customer regulations, with approximately 1,000 dan traded. After a three-day market closure, there may still be large-volume transactions, as foreign firms are expected to continue actively buying. However, due to the continuous dry weather, domestic sales have been greatly affected. Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces have not had rain for a long time, and seedlings are wilting. Farmers are busy drawing water to irrigate seedlings, and have no time to take care of lacquerware. The stagnation of domestic tung oil sales is therefore the reason. Although stockpiles in this city are low, there is little interest in importing due to the lack of sales. If there is ample rainfall, sales will definitely pick up. Therefore, when sellers are encountered, they are negotiated to replenish stockpiles. In the past one to two days, a customer from Hangzhou came to Shanghai to sell goods with sufficient oil content, with 26.6 yuan per stone offered for delivery in Shanghai, with a total of 1,500 to 1,600 stones being transacted. Reportedly, 500 stones were purchased by a certain grain firm to offset debts to a foreign firm, while the rest were purchased by tung oil firms. It is said that goods from Zhejiang are no longer popular, and there is also a foreign firm outlet in this city, although it is a small amount, it is enough to add color to the market. Therefore, even if domestic sales are slightly clear in the future, it is feared that it will be difficult to expect prices to be too low.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the announcement of the revised tariff, there were no increases or decreases, so sentiment turned stable, and trading in all sugars was very active. The guild set the market for No. 24 coarse white sugar at 20 yuan, and stock at this warehouse at 20.1 yuan, up 1 jiao, and local factory white sugar at 18.8 yuan, also up 1.15 jiao, all with transactions. Taikoo sugar B mark was offered at 20.06 yuan, and spot goods were scarce. Guangdong firms opened with more than 500 bags of Hainan red sugar, with the price still at 12.8 yuan, and the market trend was firm. Chaozhou firms opened with 400-500 bags of green sugar, with prices such as Longjiang green at 12.2 yuan and Shang Huanggang at 12.89 yuan, all up 2 or 3 jiao from before. Firms, considering the thin bottom, and the high price in Shantou, believe that they will not trade if they do not add 3 or 4 jiao. The market is tight, and Zhiyang also opened with more than 100 bags, with prices ranging from 15.5 yuan to 15.7 yuan. The market is also expected to continue to rise.</p>

<h3 id="e264">The Understanding That Should Be Had in Constructing "Mass Vernacular Literature" <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Ruo Sheng</p>
<p>The "Mass Vernacular" issue, arising from the "Classical Chinese" vs. "Vernacular Chinese" debate, has been vigorously discussed in recent days. The raising of this issue at the current stage undoubtedly has very practical significance and urgent need.</p>
<p>Language and writing are originally just products of the human social process. If the foundation of society undergoes changes, then the language and writing that represent social consciousness must gradually change accordingly. Otherwise, it will become an obstacle to social evolution. Now, in our society, the old is rapidly declining, and the new is gradually growing. To express this new consciousness, there should naturally be a new language and writing emerging, and this is the "Mass Vernacular."</p>
<p>However, judging from the various aspects of the discussion these past few days, opinions on this issue are still very inconsistent. We believe that "Mass Vernacular Literature" is not only absolutely against "Classical Chinese" 丨丨 representing "feudal consciousness", but also relatively against "Vernacular" 丨丨 the currently popular vernacular representing "bureaucratic comprador consciousness" or the like. To carry out these dual tasks, we must first seek a thorough understanding of the social relations of language development and the language itself, recognizing the opposition and unity between them. Therefore, many people now think that "Classical Chinese Revival" is of little significance, or that "Mass Vernacular Literature" is only against "Classical Chinese" and not against "Vernacular," only seeing one side of things without seeing the whole picture.</p>
<p>The so-called "Classical Chinese Revival" now, although only a dying struggle of a declining class, will not have much future. But if you do not thoroughly eliminate it, it will hinder the progress of the entire language. It's like a room with a person suffering from a very dangerous infectious disease, or a corpse that has already died. If you don't quickly send it to the hospital or bury it, how harmful it is to the rest of the healthy people. Similarly, the ghosts and monsters of this old Chinese language are now reappearing in disguise, making trouble and bewitching people everywhere. Even healthy people like Mr. Le Sibing will be bewitched by them, not to mention how many others! (See Freedom Forum, June 23rd) Therefore, in the current stage of constructing "Mass Vernacular Literature," we still have to deal with this "leftover article from the May Fourth Movement" (which will be discussed later), and we must confront it with a fighting spirit, giving it a final, fatal blow to ensure its early demise. Moreover, this "Classical Chinese Revival" movement is not just the ulterior motives of a few people; it follows the entire social trend of restoring the old.</p>
<p>As for the vernacular that arose from the "May Fourth Movement," it was a manifestation of the emerging bourgeoisie's demand for democratic politics. It has indeed accomplished a great mission in anti-feudalism, but due to the defects of their class, they could not go further and do it thoroughly. They only circled around whether it was "vernacular" or "not vernacular" in words, and did not dare to delve into the bottom of society and connect with the masses, thus leaving a way for the "feudal" revival. On the other hand, due to the intensified oppression of international imperialism after the war and other relations, they were further distanced from the masses and turned back to join hands and compromise with feudalism. In language and writing, they only replaced "zhi hu zhe ye yan" with "de na ne ma," a disguised form of stereotyped writing.</p>
<p>Today's "Trend" publishes an article by Mr. Wang Gang, believing that "constructing Mass Vernacular" is not against "Vernacular Language." If Mr. Wang's words are correct, then the articles of the Saturday school, Zhang Henshui's novels, and things that appear wearing masks of "style," "spirituality," and "quotation style" (borrowing Mr. Hu Yuzhi's words), aren't they all written in vernacular (mass vernacular?)? Why do we need to construct "Mass Vernacular Literature" again? Isn't promoting "Mass Vernacular Literature" meddling? Mr. Wang criticizes others for mechanically setting things up in opposition, but he himself says, "In this battle against the revival of the old and against Classical Chinese, there is absolutely no reason to oppose 'Vernacular Literature.' Everyone should not only construct Mass Vernacular, but also 'Vernacular Literature'." This is mechanically setting them up in opposition.</p>
<p>What exactly is "Mass Vernacular Literature"? Is "Mass Vernacular Literature" completely different from "Vernacular"? Naturally not. "Mass Vernacular Literature" does not fall from the sky or spring from the ground; it develops with the practice of the masses. This point has already been mentioned earlier. Therefore, "Mass Vernacular Literature" is not completely against "Vernacular"; it is a unified opposite to "Vernacular." In other words, "Mass Vernacular Literature" is a higher level of "Vernacular," developing a certain part of "Vernacular" and discarding another part; it is the negation of "Vernacular."</p>
<p>From the above, we have briefly pointed out the differences and similarities between "Classical Chinese," "Vernacular," and "Mass Vernacular Literature," as well as why it is necessary to construct "Mass Vernacular Literature." As for further pointing out what constitutes "Mass Vernacular Literature," we will discuss it next time. At the same time, we want the masses to discuss it together; "Mass Vernacular Literature" belongs to the masses!</p>

<p>— Long</p>
<p>The year before last, there was a great harvest, and rice prices plummeted. Farmers could not sell rice at a reasonable price and had almost no way to survive. Currently, rice prices are soaring, and famine is already a reality. Farmers not only have no rice to sell, but also have to buy expensive rice to eat. It's like a hunchback falling down, unable to land on either end, truly a dead end.</p>
<p>Without money, one naturally has no means to study abroad. With money, some people send them abroad. The other day, I saw ten little brothers and sisters being sent abroad, which was very enviable. But checking their background, most of them have influential connections. It can be seen that studying is indeed for those with power. Poor scholars shouldn't even think about it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ping-Shen train started running. Suddenly, a violent bomb exploded on the train, resulting in one death, nineteen seriously injured, and over thirty slightly injured. I think these passengers were mostly very important, and they wanted to enjoy priority rights as soon as the train opened, desperately going to the Northeast, so they suffered this loss. It's truly a bitter experience they can't complain about.</p>
<p>The five Buddhist organizations in this city initiated the installation of a giant bell, weighing 30,000 kilograms, on the highest peak of Jiuhua Mountain in Anhui. It is said that the sound of this bell can be heard for hundreds of miles, which can save the souls of the hell realm. In this way, although people cannot get a way to live, ghosts have a way to live. What a great bell to save the souls!</p>

<h3 id="e267">Reminiscences of the Past Heat <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>This unprecedented heat in the past decade has lasted for a week already, and judging from the situation, it is not expected to drop below 100 degrees within a few days. The epidemic hospital is already full, and people dying suddenly on the road are everywhere. This terrifying record seems to make the people of Shanghai uneasy, because everyone cannot find a way to avoid this unfortunate event. In this metropolis of three million people, the bourgeoisie is, after all, a minority among minorities. They can go to Mogan Mountain or Putuo Mountain to escape the summer heat. Even if they live in tall Western-style houses in Shanghai, there are summer resorts such as ice baths and night gardens for them to relax. Apart from them, the middle and lower classes, whether mentally or physically, cannot stop working because the mercury rises above 100 degrees. The diet and living habits of these people are often easily invaded by the demon of the epidemic. Therefore, it can be said with certainty that the majority of those who die from the epidemic are from the working class. As for the noble people, no matter how many weeks the unprecedented heat in the past sixty years persists, it has nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>We writers who make a living by selling manuscripts, sweating while writing manuscripts in this hot weather, although ten thousand times better than rickshaw pullers and coolies running under the scorching sun, the distance between mental labor and physical labor is only fifty steps or a hundred steps. However, compared to the farmers who look forward to the stars every night, we should be content. Although there have been two consecutive years of great harvests, due to the manipulation of rice prices and the oppression of land rent, the farmers are actually worse off than usual. The price of grain is so low that it is not enough for them to cover the cost of planting. Their hard work throughout the year has resulted in many debts. However, under heavy pressure, they still hope that grain prices will soar after this year's great harvest, pay off their debts, and live a happy year? Even if everything meets their expectations, it cannot compensate for their hardships! In the past week's unusual heat, how disappointed are the farmers! The source of their lives, the rice seedlings, are just tender shoots emerging from the water. How can they withstand a few days of extreme heat? From morning to night, they tirelessly use their legs to draw water, and the blisters on their feet are so painful that they cannot walk, but they have to draw water. As for the cattle, these are the farmers' most precious property. They are unwilling to let them do too much work; and in two years of crop failure, they reluctantly sold their most precious property to pay off their debts. Now that another year of famine is in sight, what is the pain of the farmers?</p>
<h3 id="e268">A Record of the Public Performance of Mellon Middle School <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Danfeng</p>
<p>The weather is so hot and stuffy that people cannot breathe freely, and everyone longs for the arrival of a rainstorm. The artists invited by Mellon Middle School came to a large-scale public performance in this enthusiastic and depressed mood.</p>
<p>Naturally, this performance deeply won the warm sympathy of the audience, which can be fully proved from the recent reactions in various newspapers. Indeed, the Chinese drama movement, starting with "Coal Miners" or "All Quiet on the Western Front" in 1930, has gone through "Roar, China!" until this year's "Noble People," "The Rising Moon," "Roar," "Jinbao," and finally this time's "Alarm" and "Storm on the Yangtze River," "Nora After Leaving." Whether in the content of the script or the form of the performance, obvious traces of progress can be seen. Although we admit that none of them can achieve 100% success, the proportion of success over failure is better than the latter.</p>
<p>This performance consists of four plays. Except for "Traveling Merchants in the Snow," which I never saw, I have seen the other three plays more than twice. Every audience member left a strong impression, and I have to write some messy opinions for the reference of those who participated in this performance. Where will Ibsen's Nora go after she leaves her family? This was a question that everyone paid attention to in the May Fourth era. Now, this question is answered in "Nora After Leaving." In this old society, in semi-colonial China, under the massacre of old etiquette, their only way out is to join the working masses and move towards a future of struggle. The presentation of this theme is naturally not distorted in principle. However, our playwright did not fully give the audience a strong sense of reality in terms of performance techniques. We always feel that the character played by Hu Ping, with her gorgeous clothes and affectionate husband, probably would not divorce her husband because of his passive surrender. Otherwise, it is described too inadequately. Suppose the author wrote about the destruction of her love, and that the imperialist cannons destroyed her family's economy, or the author wrote her as a healthy woman engaged in social movements, then the effect that the author expected could be discounted less. Also, the old mother's process of poisoning her children and committing suicide is also written very suddenly. Moreover, I think if we make her kill her children to teach the audience to hate her, we must strengthen her stubborn personality and vicious conspiracy, so the effect may be greater, isn't it? How terrible and solemn it is for a mother to kill her children. There also seems to be a lot of redundant dialogue for the news reporters, at least regarding the retelling of the poisoning process.</p>
<p>Due to the many technical shortcomings in the script, it is not easy to please in the performance. Generally speaking, this three-act play is not successful, although individually speaking, actors such as Hu Ping, Gu Menghu, Zhao Dan, Wang Hongyi, and Zhu Mingxian have considerable achievements. I don't want to say much about this play, and I hope the author will revise the script well. The performance on the night of the 1st was more skilled than on the night of the 30th.</p>
<p>On the other hand, "Storm on the Yangtze River" and "Alarm" have been very successful, whether in terms of script or performance. First of all, the former undoubtedly started the Chinese opera activity and adopted new content and forms. Of course, we also feel that there are many things that deserve to be improved. For example, in one performance on the 30th, we felt that the first act was probably unnecessary. At least, many words in the first act could be said at the beginning of the second act. Sure enough, when the last performance was staged, there was no first act. It started with a song and continued until the curtain closed in a tragic song, which was very compact; tragic poems, rough-lined pictures. However, if possible, after the playwright's revision, the content of the first act can be pieced together in the second act, and the indoor scene of the first act can be omitted. At the same time, the sound effects should also be made more tense and complex. As for the simple and substantial content, it indicates that the working masses on the banks of the Yangtze River are struggling under the forces of imperialism. Their common path is only to refuse to transport military supplies to them; not to build foreign wheat warehouses for them, and to participate in direct struggles together, striving for victory in blood and bullets. Finally, we want to talk about "Alarm," which is themed with depicting floods.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this is another very successful work. Who is the manufacturer of the flood? We are told very clearly here. The people donated a lot of surcharges for repairing the dikes, but where did the money go? The director of the Water Conservancy Bureau made a fortune from opium and took his concubine to the provincial capital, making a joke of the lives of millions of people under the dikes. So the people under the dikes realized, grabbed the dangerous items, and saved their own lives, only to save themselves. With such realistic material and such a correct theme, in the sound of wind, rain, thunder, gongs, and the shouts of the masses, the vast number of people under the dikes bravely and tragically fought against man-made disasters.</p>
<p>The above two plays have achieved great success, whether it is the director, scenery, lighting, and even the sound effects, all have achieved great success. Especially all the actors, under the appropriate control of the director, and under their efforts, can take care of each other, and everyone is successful in just the right amount. Nie Er's old man was so calm in "Storm on the Yangtze River." Wang Ying's bravery, Lulu's stubbornness, the little actor Hainan's cry, and the musical melody of every crowd, the actions were all just right. In Alarm, Yuan Muzhi's old man, Zheng Junli's awakened youth, Zhao Dan's young farmer, Zhu Mingxian's aunt, Wu Mei's peasant woman, even the little boy and Hainan's siblings (especially Hainan covering his ears when he heard the thunder), everyone was working very hard and showing great talent. Fully expressing the truth is their great achievement, and the makeup of Yuan Muzhi and Nie Er is even more miraculous.</p>
<p>Well, in general, the full expression of the sense of reality in the above two plays should bear all the beautiful adjectives, which is determined by the content of the script and does not need to be explained. Finally, in addition to expressing our sincere respect for those who presided over and participated in this performance, we deeply believe that the Chinese drama movement is indeed bravely progressing in difficult and arduous situations.</p>

<p>He stood up, bothered her with the smoke from his cigarette, bent down and kissed her on the mouth, and sat on the edge of the bed. "Get up quickly and see the XX song and dance troupe. Those women don't wear pants," he gestured.</p>
<p>"Nothing good comes out of a dog's mouth!" She gave him a coquettish pat on the shoulder and jumped out of bed.</p>
<p>He retreated to the sofa, closed his eyes, almost wanting to fall asleep. The woman looked in the mirror and hurriedly put down her towel and sat on his body, shaking his head with both hands and saying, "What's making you unhappy? Tell me, tell me."</p>
<p>He pushed the woman away with force, "Wash your face!" The woman still wanted to twist onto him, but seeing his face was tense, she didn't push it, grumbling as she sat on the stool in front of the bed, combing and washing in front of the mirror.</p>
<p>"Hurry up!" he said anxiously.</p>
<p>The woman looked at the broken mirror next to the door and said with a pout, "What's the rush? It's not even two o'clock yet. You always make such a big noise when I invite you to the movies. If you don't want to go, fine. It's not like I sent you a red invitation!"</p>
<p>He made a gesture to stand up, but his whole body seemed to have no strength, so he ignored the woman's words and turned sideways to take out the cigarette case. There wasn't even one cigarette inside, so he threw it angrily on the table. "Do you have any cigarettes?"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't ask you for one if I had any."</p>
<p>"Go buy some!"</p>
<p>"Where's the money?" She turned around and held out her rouge-smeared hand.</p>
<p>He pulled out two five-yuan notes from his pocket and threw them over, but they fell halfway through the air. The woman picked them up and hid them in her vest pocket, then turned back to apply rouge to her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Go buy cigarettes!" he said impatiently, standing up. "It's not like I'll die from addiction! I haven't even eaten yet!" She looked up and made a face at him.</p>
<p>"Son of a bitch!" He grabbed her shoulder and pushed her, and the woman rolled straight onto the bed. He didn't even glance at her, opened the door and left.</p>
<p>Outside the alley, he changed two dimes at the cigarette shop, and after receiving the copper coins, he stood there in a daze, as if thinking about something. Finally, he put them in his pocket and jumped into a rickshaw on the side of the road. "Sir, where to?" the rickshaw puller asked, turning his head as he ran.</p>
<p>"Just pull!" He kicked the rickshaw puller's butt with his leather shoe.</p>
<p>He got off the rickshaw at the entrance of his alley. The Indian patrolman greeted him and asked, "Why not watch movie?" He shook his head and returned home.</p>
<p>"Where did you go?" his wife asked.</p>
<p>"Buying cigarettes." He reached into his pocket, but made no sound and didn't take anything out.</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I have a very close friend. She has a gentle temperament and a quiet disposition, but it is not easy to hear her speak usually. She has a middle school education, has a strong desire to study, and especially likes to study art. She has some small artistic skills, but unfortunately, due to environmental and economic reasons, she finally dropped out of school halfway. She is now employed as a teacher at XX Elementary School. I admire her behavior and everything about her extremely; however, her eloquence is not good, and as for social interaction, it is of course very ordinary; therefore, she has few friends, and as for the opposite sex, she doesn't have a single one. Sir, I have told you about her movements and everything; now I want to trouble you to think of a way for her for the sake of my best friend!</p>
<p>In today's society where "men and women are equal and social interactions are open," she still adheres to extremely old etiquette. Although her colleagues admire and respect her, if someone occasionally mentions marriage to her, she will politely decline and say, "Marriage is a major matter that should be decided by parents." Since she is so conservative, shouldn't she follow "the words of a matchmaker and the orders of parents"? But she doesn't follow. This isn't right, that isn't right. It has been three or four years since she dropped out of school. In these few years, I know that she really doesn't have anyone else in mind; looking at her actions, it's as if she has embraced the idea of staying single.</p>
<p>Recently, I see that she is distracted, mentally tired, and her appearance is also haggard; so I have tried every means to ask her</p>
