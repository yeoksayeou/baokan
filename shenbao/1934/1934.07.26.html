<p>華盛頓海軍會議。樹太平洋上列强均勢之原則後。英美日三國。除一二特殊區域外。均願停建任何海軍根據地於太平洋。而更停止其龐大之造艦計畫。然自日本背九國公約。佔領滿洲。更於加羅林　島。設軍事工程。於是太平洋之均勢打破。而華盛頓條約。在精神上與事實上亦已成爲廢紙。近傳美國欲在亞拉斯加附近。設置海軍新根據地。蓋亦必然之結果。而日本於感受此種威脅之際。希望戰争之心。或益加劇。磨刀霍霍。勢不相讓。戰爭之禍。殆在旦夕·</p>
<p>亞拉斯加半島。與俄屬西伯利亞。僅隔一白林海峽。其南部之阿留申列島。總數一百五十。連結於堪察加半島與阿拉斯加之間。有如貫珠。諸島在軍事上之價値。久爲日本所留意。時派船行。繪製精密之海圖。去歲美國海軍當局。始派兵艦前往測量。準備建造海軍根據地。日本方面卽起抗議。現美國海軍當局。已製有此地帶之飛機照相所成之圖。前日陸軍部之航空事業調查委員會發表報告。更主張在半島上設航空之大規模根據地。於諸島之上。善爲組織。而美國前陸軍航空司令米起爾更言。『使美國以亞拉斯加爲空軍中心必能控制全世界。』則美國之欲經營此島。用心甚爲堅决。更可顯然。吾人對於美國在阿拉斯加設防之問題。所應加考慮者。卽美國是否有實行此計畫之權利。此計畫實行後。於軍事上之影響又將如何。夫華盛頓條約。所以禁止簽約國建製新海軍根據地於太平洋者也。然據國際之成例。凡簽約國一方。已放棄其條約上之義務。則他方亦可不受條約上義務之支配。方日本侵犯滿洲之際。美前國務卿史汀生。曾致書於參議員波拉。聲言。曩者美國之答應放棄在太平洋設防之權利實以日本接受五五三海軍比例及中國領土保全與門户開放爲條件。今日本旣蔑視條約義務於先。則美國對於日本。已無守此禁條之必要。所成問題者。華盛頓條約。非單純屬於美日二國間之條約。其間蓋有四國條約與九國條約之分。美國對日本以外各國應負若何義務。固一國際法上錯綜複雜之問題也。美國目前所以不卽實行其計畫之原因。或卽在此。</p>
<p>軍事形勢方面。因亞拉斯加築根據地面引起之變化。甚爲明顯。美國對於遠東。自華盛頓條約後。向取人我不相犯之態度。蓋自海力限制。根據地限制以後。美欲攻日或日欲攻美。皆不能操必勝之劵。今建造亞拉斯加根據地之計畫。如能實現。則日本將隨時受到美國海空軍之威脅。以日本今日之海軍力。欲獨覇於中國海上。固綽有餘裕。欲對付太平洋之北部東部。則尙有薄弱之感。矧目前日俄二國。方欲有事於西伯利亞美國卽於西伯利亞東端設置軍備。一則以增加日人後顧之憂。一則以鼓勵蘇俄東進之勇。此其意義。已異尋常。數日來復盛傳蘇俄將闢北冰洋海路。自列寗格勒查達白林海一帶。其間之微妙關係。泃可令人玩味也。</p>

<p>英美恊商英日折衝多邊交涉五角對立</p>
<p>一九三五年的海軍會議前途、隱伏着若干暗礁、并且這種暗礁很不容易消除、這是英美各國一般人所深知的事、所以先由英國提議邀集一個豫備會議、由英美兩國在倫敦開始會談、同時更邀請日本來共作三角會商、并且還請法·意·兩國參加、作多邊的商酌、英美會談是六月十八日舉行的、地點在唐寗街内閣總理官邸、英國方面出席的人是首相麥唐納、海長蒙塞爾、海軍中將里德爾、外交部美洲局長克勒格、美國方面有軍縮會議代表台維斯、駐英大使賓干、大使館參贊阿薩登海軍少將黎、最先交換彼此的意見、發表了一通簡單的申明書、對日本主張廢除海軍此率、訂立國防平等權、他們都表示反對、再次則對一九三五年海軍會議地點、也曾擬議是在倫敦·巴黎·或布魯塞等、但還没有得到一致的意見、當日午後、日本駐英大使松平恒雄卽訪英相麥唐納於衆議院、叩問英美折衝的經過、并附帶說明日本的意見、十九日美國代表台維斯訪日本駐英大使於其官邸、說明美國的立塲、并探聽日本對海軍軍縮的意見、至於法國意國都還没有正式通告、這次會談、表面上并不十分重要、又不要求立卽作出結論、但是内容依舊很複雜、前途的困難還是非常之多、例如英美的諒解、美日的調和、法意的折衝、是否能够圓滿、再退一步說、是否能得到暫時相安、都成問題、因爲海軍軍縮問題至少包括得有兩方面、一面是政治問題、一面是軍備的技術關係、如果政治問題得不到相當適當的解答、則技術關係也總是弄不清楚的、譬如政治問題中太平洋上最大的懸案是馬里亞納·加洛林·馬夏爾·三羣島的代管問題、照國際法的解釋、日本旣已通告退出國際聯盟、假如明年不聲明重回國聯、則該項管理權卽應交回國聯、但是日本非但不表示交還、而且那些島上、建立空軍標誌、建立海軍根據、安置種種的軍事防禦、因此引起美國的不安、引起英國的注意、那末海軍軍縮的技術折衝就要不容易調解了、何况日本占領東三省之後、大有積極南下之勢、所以英美格外不放心、海軍縮小更加困難、日本提出預備會議不談政治問題、（把東三省和代營赤道以北的三羣島都抛開不談）否則日本卽不參加會議、這一點、美國是很不痛快、量英國則加以承認、所以現時的會談是不講政治關係、而專門講海軍技術的、</p>
<p>就是海軍技術、以英美兩國而論、也是不能一致的、英國的海岸綫大約有七萬哩以上、她在全世各地都有殖民地、有殖民地就有軍港、英國的海軍很容易上煤·上油·上水事實上她不必要巨艦大砲卽能保護其海上安全、維持她商業上的交通、不過英國有一個很大的缺陷、就是食糧不能自給自足、必須仰給於海外、而她所有的商船隊很容易改裝成有力的巡洋艦、所以她祗要多數的輕巡艦、英國現有的巡洋艦五十艘、再過二年有十艘因老朽退伍、英國計劃要建造三十艘新巡洋艦、總計七十艘新艦的目標、美國以爲這個數目太大、於軍縮前途是很不利的、然而美國要保持太平洋和大西洋的交通、巴拿馬運河的安全、門羅主義的實效、遂不得不力主巨艦大砲主義、但又不能公然提倡軍擴、因而想出一種暫維現狀的辦法、卽是延長華盛頓倫敦兩次海約、主力艦輔助艦都照以前的恊定、這是英美意見的差别、</p>
<p>至於日本根本上主張廢除比率主義、其藉口是說海參崴方面有新的威脅、她要保持遠東的和平、英美却一致以爲不應如此解釋、她們三國業立的主張是不能調和的、况且意大利又决定要建造三萬五千噸軍艦兩艘、法國以爲意國海軍岸綫旣很短、這樣巨大的軍艦、有什麽必要、本來法意在地中海就互相對立、爲爭北非洲霸權而相持、現在又發生這種新問題、拿到海軍軍縮會議上來、又難于解决、英國要保持通布羅陀海峽與蘇彝運河的交通、對意國這樣的擴充海軍、也不能不感到壓迫的嚴重、如此不同的立塲、發生出各種歧異的主張、那能在豫備會議中求得妥恊呢、（六月二十日於倫敦）</p>

<p>此實冒險性这驅使、决非止財神菩薩之迷住也、須知財神菩薩最最小氣、决不願以驚人之數迷人、稍稍施與、若不持盈保泰、即奪之矣、故債權人所謂「俟債務清還、舉而還諸榮氏、此崇德報功之意「、此即財神廟裏的泥菩薩、常有此脾氣、於今各國並立作商戰殊死鬥之時世、决不合宜、依弟理想、則生兩失、其第一失、則大有收清借欵、馬上散夥之意、一若被白狗咬了、應當見白羊亦怕、債權人亦不敢放債甚至美國前年、連銀行都不相信、也學起我們開了地害、藏放現銀的一法、近年全世界之弄成不景氣此爲根本原因、故羅斯福毅然干涉、美國金融界亦相對矯正、我政府自不應贊助此消極辦法、其又一失、則辛辛苦苦替榮氏還清債項勝下一大筆拿來崇功報德、勸他此後持盈保泰、也開丨地窖茂放、純粹造成榮氏爲富翁、我政府便無異打倒事業家、來獎勵富翁、亦說不過去、什麽呌商塲、什麽呌金融、我們外行、堅决的相信、就是放僓的放債、經營的經營、在市塲上用一個信用、循環流通、如是而已、放債祇放到富翁、不放到事業家、即一消極之商塲、硬化之金融、毫無戰鬥力、再進一步、即不景氣之狀態而已、放債絶對冒險而亂放、自然不合理、但經營的、應望他有事業家、放債的亦應望他有事業家、若眼晴亦看不清、手腕亦放不開、没有冒險的天才、能稱得事業家的現在也就不少呀、若一個有德可崇、有功可報的人物、其人固有短處、想來必有長處、還不値得英雄惜英雄、用科學方法來藥其短而用其長、事業拉着事業家、造成積極之商塲嗎、我的瞎想、並不算全無價値罷、何必大家收包、反爲人辛苦、</p>

<p>又報答人、拿了賸餘、去享福乎、弟前書所說、「惟恐以尋常商業盈虧相視、或偏於消極之維持、苟一重心失去又加以外人之破壞安知不由消極而萎縮、終至於傾覆而後已」、即早知有此也、然此等消極之辦法、所以形成者、即由於「最怕復辟」、何以怕復辟、即由「恐以榮氏爲中心、蹈無組織無管理之覆轍」、無組織無管理、而且其轍已覆、自然爲再要不得的東西、這辟自然不可以再讓他復、然簡單下一斷語、問何以無組織無管理之人物、會有德有功、他賸了一個已覆的轍、何以還須崇與報、只不是幽默得太利害嗎、所以大家熱心的要望榮先生在百尺竿頭、再進一步、馬上採用一尤好之組織、尤好之管理、只是令人心悅誠服的、若因此馬上批評榮先生的過去、是一個無組織無管理、就是孟子所說周餘黎民、糜有孑遺、是文害了詞、詞害了志了、不惟我們的舊組織舊管理、即决不勝任、今後如此龐大之事業、然勉强支持從前之事業、轍或恐其必覆也、還尙未覆、若以此次之不順手、即算成爲覆、將錯就錯、呌榮先生眞個被覆、未免太寃枉了罷、只個再在下面奉告、現在且結論了組織與管理再說、故榮先生從前用的是舊組織舊管理、而且他有他的天才、不但舊組織舊管理、是並不鬆懈、而且運用存乎一心、有些鷄零狗碎的小花樣、必定還有若專家細細研究、極切合中國情形、改良了、還値得保留罷、我是測想的、並不是眼見的、因爲不是他有他的組織、他的管理、何以事業會膨脹到如此、何以外人看了、如同眼中之釘、轉轉灣灣、必願倒之而後快、不然、他將自覆之不暇、何必用大力氣來摧枯拉朽、所以說榮先生是無組織無管理、是太過分的話、我是决不相信、就是眞正的專家、不是止懂的書本上幾句話的、也不願意下此肯定的否定、上面已經說過、榮先生我迷信不會把申新造做</p>

<p>那就本來無辟、也就談不到復與不復、現在再討論塋先生之轍、到底已覆或未覆、據我所知、談不到覆字、我聞大部加以調查、產業與債項相抵、已虧一千餘萬、然而財政部調查、又說產業六千八百萬、抵僓而有微餘、此即政府代查之可信者、兩部相差之故、一則認爲已覆、一若關店的生財與底貨、應該折扣甚大、一則認爲尋常查廠、止予以實地正當之折扣、所以相差了一千餘萬、而榮氏方面　鬁頭兒子自已的好、當然折扣更小、還說餘了一千餘萬、若折中而信財政部的調查、就是申新廠本錢止是别人的、只何消說得呢、原來那一個大公司大銀行、本錢不是别人的呢、所以舍了申新廠、說榮先生是萬萬家財、那是向來的讕言、而報紙傳聞、說申新欠人六千餘萬、把產業不算、即就榮宗敬先生虧得一塌糊塗了、也恐怕是笑話罷、六千餘萬内之債權、股份亦在其内、那恐怕榮氏的股份、必也可觀、所以他若從此收包、不失爲富翁、定可相信的、然而起了謠言、說是轍已覆了、那就債權人各不相讓、訟爭了累年、機器是銹爛了、大塊的地皮、不放價無人收領、利錢天天的加上去、那就債項大大的超過了現在、產業的估價、那種折扣、大部與財政部、皆已不屑估、止好請北京路的舊貨店來估、那就理想的、可以止賸了一千萬、關門三年以後、榮先生眞虧了六千萬、應了今日報紙傳聞之誤、也未可知、所以榮先生之轍、今日絶不曾覆、欲覆之、不欲覆之、亦在社會、</p>

<p>然則今日榮先生何以不順手、曰金融擱淺、何以擱淺、就受了世界不景氣影響、並不絶對在組織管理上、而且如此之擱淺、尋常商店、日日有之、榮先生之事業大了、兜得轉的時節、好像家中眞的橫了金山銀山、兜不轉了、便發生問題、如此發生之問題、國民政府以前之政府、休戚毫不相關、發生　幾次、均是賢明之社會維護住了、馬上又兜、今則與前數次毫無以異、旣有賢明之社會、又有賢明之政府、一杓水澆下去、船頭馬上又動、若加以尤好之組織、尤好之管理、恐怕下次擱淺時、還要順利、如若無病而呻、不當他活馬、喂點料便算、去當他死馬、來大開其刀、一個互相恐慌、也就牽倒他、不要費什麽吹灰之力罷、方今任何一大公司、一大銀行、若去當他已覆的調查、折扣任意的定着、那就没有什麽公司、什麽銀行、不會倒罷、就是外國個個大王、也可十倒其八九、所以賢明的社會、賢明的政府、上要發見不是買空賣空、輕鬆的維護一下、事業家便站得穩定的了、故弟於「最怕復辟」一語、費七八張紙、以　先生者、供先生萬一可以慰解債權人、錯誤的弄到眞個覆了榮先生、僓權人必首先吃虧也、雖刺刺骨腫、但殊無一要、可以不必賜覆、敬復叩道安、弟敬恒頓首、</p>

<p>新聲社云、在華日本紡織同業會、自我國進口新稅實行後、會長船津辰一郎、除請求减輕棉花進口稅外、並晉謁孔部長、向我紡織業領袖徵求意見茲誌詳情如下請恢復舊稅　該會請求財政部要求减輕棉花進口稅率、仍恢復舊稅率理由、（一）增加棉花進口關稅、足以杜絶輸出、使製品供給過多、市價跌落、以致棉工業衰退、結果、使栽棉農業招致惡影響、（甲）現下民國之棉紗布工業、雖因國民購買力疲弊、而不得不縮短工作至某程度、但尙不免於供給過多、故全恃勵行過剩製品之運銷國外、以保需給之調節、但因輸出品所到達之地方之競爭國棉製品、完全用免稅之原料、故競爭甚形困難、（乙）棉花進口稅起、初每担僅銀六錢、其後加至一兩二錢、至去年五月、又增加至每百兛海關銀三·五○、卽每棉紗一包徵稅約十七元、此次再增加至每百兛海關銀五·○○、卽每棉紗一包、徵稅二十四元、比最初之稅率、約增加六七倍、課如此重稅以後、必至製品輸出杜絶、（丙）使棉製品停止輸出以後、其結果、外則使貿易惡化、内則招致過剩製品之濫費、與紡績同業者激烈之競爭、勢必至於擴大縮短工作之範圍、或不得已而倒閉工廠、使失業者人數增加、因此、棉花消費必减退、以致棉花市價跌落、無裨益於農村、且亦無補於獎勵栽棉、（二）增加進口原棉關稅、卽增加國内消費階級之負担、（甲）外棉輸入中國之數量、最近五年間之統計、每年平均約三百二十七萬、此等外棉、依氣候風土之關係、大半其棉種不適於中國耕作、欲希望達到自給自足、尙須經過長久之年月、故今日突然提高關稅、加以保護、亦不能期待迅速之增產、（乙）今日對於農村之設施、尙未實行、其效果未有可觀、遽爾提高關稅、其結果决不能杜絶此等特種原棉之進口、僅使國内消費階級、負担關稅增加之部份、以减退其購買力、</p>
<p>孔部長解釋該會會長船津辰一郎、</p>
<p>自我國進口新稅則實行後、以棉花進口稅較前增加、與日本在華紡織廠關係甚大、曾以私人名義、向我國紗廠業領袖聶潞生等、徵求對於增加棉花進口稅之意見、並於上尾期四、謁財政部長孔祥熙於外灘中央銀行、陳述要求將棉花進口新稅收回成命理由、孔部長當祥爲解釋、此次棉花增加進口稅、目的在救濟我國農村、奬勵植棉農民、同時關稅收入增加、至於棉織口紙類稅之减低、均經再三審查、故對棉進口稅不允减輕、</p>
<p>船津之談話　新聲社記者、昨晨往訪在華日本紡織同業會會長船津辰一郎、據談、本會要求减輕棉花進口稅理由、已詳陳述於財政部、又孔部長對、於增稅意見、頗有理由、但事實上、日本在華紡織所雇工人、均爲華籍、無異中國工廠、僅資本爲日本商人而已、中國每年棉紗布疋出口、如去年棉紗爲五十四萬一千担、疋頭爲二十八萬八千担、是項出口貨、均係在華日本紗廠及中國紗廠所出、原料棉花稅增加後、勢必無法向外推銷、改向中國國内推銷、則中國紗廠與日本紗廠營業競爭更烈、將來結果、中日紗廠、均將蒙重大損失云、</p>

<p>實施搗亂　公共租界區域内小販、向在沿馬路呌賣、惟良莠不齊、故一部小販、爲人所厭惡、曾由二區市民會請工部局制止、工部局允其所請、卽派警務車隨時捉捕處罰、以致每處三四次者有之、因此難以營生、不能維持生計、於前日集合小販數百人、向市商會·市民會·請願、因無圓滿結果、經大衆會議之結果、在各地貨行附近實施搗亂行動、如有顧主買成西瓜及各種鮮貨水菓、一出行門、卽上前施行搗亂手段、以致狼藉滿地、不堪收拾、彼等一哄而散、買主則徒喚奈何、</p>
<p>無法銷售　昨日上午五時許、此輩小販、已卽在南市十六舖·北市老閘橋·新閘橋·虹口吳淞路·等處搗亂、强迫阻止買賣、各地貨行以事關整個營業、卽行報告捕房派警制止、無如此來彼去、無法捕捉、以致瓜類皆存於行内、無從銷售、鄕人以其所載之瓜、天時炎熱、不能久擱、若日久擱置、必致腐爛、因此大爲懊喪、</p>
<p>公會意見據地貨業同業公會負責人談、本會今晨（二十五日）各同行來會報告、謂有公共租界水菓攤販、多因受當局嚴厲取締、無以營生、以致停業、並派定攤販多人、守候各行附近馬路、禁止其他各小販向各行買貨營業、經本會調查、確係實在、並設法勸導、終難避免、惟該項糾紛、當局若不卽予解决、恐將更形擴大、而難收拾、以本會意見、當分兩方面講、對於攤販方面、各攤販爲維持生活、更要當局從寛辦理、此項進行交涉、應有組織、並須嚴守秩序、以不妨碍治安爲原則、不宜以强迫手段、禁止其他小販營業、若如此辦理、雖屬出於氣憤、但實有犯罪之嫌、在理當推定代表數人、向當局請願、要求維持向例、俾攤户得以生活、或請當地市民團體、予以援助、再各攤販因此而停業、亦非所宜、蓋各攤販若一日不營業、卽一日不能過活、應營業仍當繼續、暫時設法避免當局之取締、一面進行交涉、自可得相當之解决、對於當局方面、應顧全一般小本市民之生計、不能祗顧行政上之設施、要知各攤販均因社會經濟困迫、農村破產、在家鄕不能安生、而無法趨入都市、以小本販賣、俾博微利、以活一家數口生命、是以當局對於取締界内攤販、應雙方兼顧、變通從寛辦理、則該項糾紛、得以消滅於無形、否則延不解决、恐與地方治安有碍也、</p>

<p>丨丨答朱明君丨丨</p>
<p>設壇求雨是一種迷信的行爲，這是凡有常識的人都知道的事。處在科學已經有了高度發展的今日，迷信的行爲顯然是社會進步的一大障礙·而贊助迷信的人們則顯然含有麻醉作用。一方面我們已明白地看見世界的科學家能够用科學方法，確實地造成了人工的雨水，他方面我們却耗許多的金錢，人力去作無益的祈求。這實在是今日世界上的一件怪事！</p>
<p>迷信行爲在落後的民衆間是一種習俗，而且都有很長久的根深蒂固的歷史。求雨也就是這習俗之一種。民衆的生活全賴農耕維持，農耕的順利又决定於雨水的適量的降落，雨水是關乎民衆的生死問題的。在不知道科學的封建時代，人們不明白雨水何以會降落，只得用神力加以解釋，遇到雨水久不降落時，就用求雨的儀式去獻媚於他們所想像中的神，這在多年以前的社會裏，是無可如何的事。然而到科學昌明以後，人們便不能再將自已的命運付諸鬼神的意志，而漸漸地知道自已起來征服自然，使自然界的一切能於人類的生活有利。因此，隨着資本主義的發達及科學的進步，迷信的行爲在人類社會中就漸漸的消滅，例如在中國，五四文化運動後，就漸漸有人知道科學的重要性而起來反對迷信和神權了。然而到近年來，尤其是到今年來，迷信的行爲忽然被人很普遍地提倡起來，最初有時輪金剛法會大閙特閙，接着又是科學靈乩圖的發現，最近的求雨，則活佛，天師，天主敎徒都一起動員，幾乎使人疑心自已是生在幾百年前一樣的了。這是爲什麽呢，難道科學眞的不行了嗎？</p>
<p>其實這事情並不是偶然的，我們現在的周圍，不但有迷信行爲的恢復運動，而且濃厚地充滿着懷古的氣氛，在學校裏，文言文又代替了白話文，在社會生活上，四書五經中的說敎又被人提倡起來。顯然的是有人在企圖收民衆拉回到二千年前的生活狀態裏，在這樣的情勢之下，趁着旱災將要形成的時候，又來一番求雨的迷信行爲，是勢所必然的事。所以，雖然明知求雨的行爲是多麽無聊，仍然不但没有人反對，反而有人大加提倡，也正是利用舊習俗以加厚懷古的氣氛的表現之一罷了。（未完）</p>

<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>胡適博士，在他的「嘗試篇」中說：「自古成功在嘗試」。雖然胡適博士現在已失掉了作靑年的導師的地位，可是「自古成功在嘗試」這句話，是始終値得我們吟味的。</p>
<p>「嘗試」的精神，是「五四」的精神。現在中國的靑年，是要始終具有着「嘗試」的精神的。</p>
<p>「五四」時代，進步的知識分子，反對封建的文言文，主張白話。於是他們去嘗試創造白話文學，拿出自已的白話文的作品來。這種白話文的作品的製作的實踐，是打倒文言文的好武器。可是，「五四」潮流一靜止，白話文言化的傾向，就日趨發達了。</p>
<p>白話文言化的傾向，是明末精神的復活，這種精神，直造成了現在的「袁中郎主義」的文學。這種「袁中郎主義」，當然，是一種士大夫文學。是一種變相的文言文的文學。大槪是針對着這種「中郎主義」的傾向，及其弟兄的傾向，產了大衆語文學運動。</p>
<p>關於大衆語文學，我從未發表意見過。但在將來的社會中，一定會有大衆語文學之產生，是無容疑義的，雖然，在現在環境中，對於建立大衆語，是有好些困難。</p>
<p>對於大衆語文學之建立，環境問題，是先决問題。而將來的大衆語，也許是一種「科學的國語」。大衆語應是綜合的，而不應是分離的。而在中國，是需要產生一種統一的大衆話。自然，對於苗蠻，是有例外。</p>
<p>大衆語問題之提出，是有意義的。不過，到現在，理論還是很觀念，很含混。爲得救助這一點，我以爲，應當大家努力作大衆語文學制作之實踐。自然，在製作實踐中，是會有缺點和困難的。可是，製作實踐，是可以使我們遇到各種問題，而使大衆語理論能有更進一步的展開。而只有製作的實踐，才能證明理論之正確或錯誤。大衆語文學之制作，是目的。一味地空談理論，是不够的。</p>
<p>昨天，一位老友向我說：「在「五四」時代反對文言，主張白話，而反對文言文的文章，是用白話寫的，可是，現在大衆語提倡者，主張大衆語，而没有一個人是用大衆語寫作。」我覺得這是一個對大衆語提倡者的一個忠實的勸告。</p>
<p>在大衆語問題討論中，中要的是拿出大衆語的作品來。而討論的文章，最好是要用大衆語寫寫看。是應當拿出大衆語文字的Ｍodel來。「自古成功在嘗試」。只有製作實踐的嘗試，是能使大衆語文字獲得成功的。</p>
<h3 id="c184">玩笑只當牠玩笑（下） <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 康伯度</p>
<p>别一枝討伐白話的生力軍，是林語堂先生。他討伐的不是白話的「反而難懂」，是白話的「魯里魯蘇」，連劉先生似的想白話「返樸歸眞」的意思也全没有，要達意，只有「語錄式」（白話的文言）。</p>
<p>林先生用白話武裝了出現的時候，文言和白話的時候，文言和白話的鬭爭早已過去了，不像劉先生那樣，自已是混戰中的過來人，因此也不免有感懷舊日，慨歎末流的情緒。他一閃而將宋明語錄，擺在「幽默」的旗子下，原也極其自然的。</p>
<p>這「幽默」便是「論語」四十五期裏的「一張字條的寫法」，他因爲要問不匠討一點油灰，寫好了一張語錄體的字條，但怕别人說他「反對白話」，便改寫了白話的，選體的，桐城派的三種，然而都很可笑，結果是差「書僮」傳話，向木匠討了油灰來。</p>
<p>「論語」是風行的刋物，這里省煩不抄了。總之，是：不可笑的只有語錄式的一張，别的三種，全都要不得。但這四個不同的脚色的替代，其實是都是林先生自已一個人扮出來的，一個是正生，就是「語錄式」，别的三個都是小丑自裝鬼臉自作怪相，將正生櫬得一表非凡了。</p>
<p>但這已經並不是「幽默」，乃是「頑笑」，和市井間的在牆上畫一烏龜，背上寫上他所討厭的名字的戰法，也並不兩樣的。不過看見的人，却往往不問是非，就嗤笑被畫者。</p>
<p>「幽默」或「頑笑」，也都要生出結果來的，除非你心知其意，只當牠「頑笑」看。</p>
<p>因爲事實會並不如文章，例如這語錄式的條子，在中國其實也並未斷絶過種子。假如有工夫，不妨到上海的衖口去看一看，有時就會看見一圙攤，坐着一位文人，在替男女工人寫信，他所用的文章，决不如林先生所擬的條子的容易懂，然而分明是「語錄式」的。這就是現在從新提起的語錄派的末流，却並没有誰去塗白過他的鼻子。</p>
<p>這是一個具體的「幽默」。</p>
<p>但是，要賞識「幽默」也眞難。我曾經從生理學來證明過中國打屁股之合理：假使屁股是爲了排洩或坐坐而生的罷，就不必這麽大，脚底要小得遠，不是足够支持全身了麽？我們現在早不喫人了，肉也用不着這麽多。那麽，可見是專供打打之用的了。有時告訴人們，大抵以爲是「幽默」。但假如有被打了的人，或自已遭了打，我想，恐怕那感應就不能這樣了罷。</p>
<p>没有法子，在大家都不適意的時候，恐怕終於是「中國没有幽默」的了。</p>
<h3 id="c185">一張字條的寫法 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>林語堂先生寓中裝做紗窗，邊没露了小縫；要想寫張字條去討油灰來補窟窿。「初爲天然寫法，即白話的文言：後來恐人見到反對，乃復改爲文言的白話，而又恐木匠不懂，殊失「大衆語」意義。後來越改越昏，竟無意中作一篇似通非通的四六，自覺不愜意，乃又學韓退之，起八代之衰，作三代古文，覺得油灰二字文不雅馴，乃復半途而廢。」（論語四十五期我的話）這是林先生開玩笑的筆法，意在言外，彼此心照不宣。</p>
<p>林先生所擬四種便條，駢體的固不愜，學韓的也有點非驢非馬，「文言的白話」故意寫得扭扭揑揑，不近不情；現在且就林先生所謂「天然寫法」來商榷一下。林先生原條如下：　　「ＸＸ寳號。前日由汝裝置紗窗，只因邊沿胡縫，蚊子遂得而入，來一隻，捉一隻，又來一隻，令人日間坐不得，夜間眠不得，苦甚。茲差人前來，請給予油灰少許，俾得修補爲荷。幸母以油灰爲重，信用爲輕是禱。ＸＸ啟」</p>
<p>這張便條，依我看來，並不是天然的寫法。這個便條，自的在拿一點油灰，不必說什麽理由，即要說理由，也只說窗沿有縫便够了；蚊子進出問題，似乎不必提起。「假使這便條寫給愛人，那又當别論；也許愛人看了蚊子叮的情形而有點心痛，趕快買了油灰送來，亦未可知。）</p>
<p>看罷，我來試試看：</p>
<p>（甲）文言式</p>
<p>前日所裝紗窗，窗沿尙有裂縫，着人就取油灰，請即給予些許是盼此致</p>
<p>ＸＸ寳號ＸＸＸ</p>
<p>（乙）白話式</p>
<p>那天，你們替我裝的紗窗，邊上有了漏縫；此刻派人到店中拿點油灰，請包一點兒給他帶回來！</p>
<p>ＸＸ寳號ＸＸＸ</p>
<p>林先生最後的辦法，呌阿經口頭傳話去。我想阿經到店討油灰，一定有這樣一番對話：</p>
<p>「阿經」丨丨老板，林先生呌我來拿點油灰去。</p>
<p>老板丨丨做什麽用呀？</p>
<p>阿經丨丨那天，你們替我們裝的紗窗，邊上有了漏縫啦！</p>
<p>老板丨丨夥計！包一點油灰，給他帶回去！」</p>
<p>好了，我的便條和阿經口頭說的話相一致了。林先生，我們還是放棄那「白話的文言」，來寫老老實實的大衆語罷！</p>
<h3 id="c186">村居回憶 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>我曾經在寳山泗塘橋的農家，度過一個淸快的夏天的。如今回憶起來，那繞着小河圍着綠樹的鄕間村落，便驀地帶來一片蟬聲，展現在我的面前了，而我也彷彿再又到了昔遊之地一樣。</p>
<p>那位年老的房主人，可還是在正午時分，抱着小孩兒，拖着一雙受了濕氣的腫足，緩緩地走到木槿花樹紥成的籬邊，皺着額頭皮望一會陽光辣辣的田間，然後默默地走了回來，在棗子樹蔭下，低頭坐着，無力地搧着蒲草扇，讓蒼蠅在臉上徐徐遊行的麽？但願如今仍舊是這樣的，因爲我心裏只是想着他那樣的年紀，那樣一雙病足，也許在一二八戰事的期間，已經碰着一顆小小的子彈，跌到溪溝裏面去了哩。</p>
<p>他的妻，一位愛說話的老婆子，想來該是健存着的吧，常常滿頭是汗地從棉地裏走了回來，一進那垂着一兩株向日葵花的籬門，就作聲地喚着，應聲而去的白雞呀花雞呀，就像一羣孩子似的，圍在她的週遭，伸着長長的頸子。她那統着什麽東西的藍布圍裙，便突地放開，各種嫩綠的靑草，就紛紛撒在羣雞的身上頸上了。同時她又像逃避什麽似地趕快躱開，眼睛很迅速地注意到另一方面去了。</p>
<p>「呵呀，猪又跑出來了！」</p>
<p>或是：</p>
<p>「怎樣晒的哪？衣衫吹到泥地上去了。」</p>
<p>她一回來，總是屋裏廊下都洋溢着她那滿有精力的聲音。當窗坐着看書或是寫字的我，便往往引得抬起頭來，想從靜穆悠閒的小屋裏走了出去，分享她那忙祿中的愉愉。因爲閒極了，便會羨幕勞動的人的。</p>
<p>每天看書倦了，站起身來，伸伸腰部，舉舉手腕的時候，點綴着白頭巾女人的靑色棉地，便越過籬落，和淸風一道，送來窗前。倘若她的兩個兒子也在棉地裏工作，我早就會把書本抛在桌上，木拖鞋，撩在屋角落裏，赤足跑去和她們一道扯草去了。因爲田間還有她年輕的媳婦和女兒，在中國這麽樣的社會，理應加以避忌的。</p>
<p>她的兩個兒子，從來不到棉地去扯草（彷彿扯草是規定女人作的）只做些另外的事情，有時且半天半天的睡覺，醒了後還要懶懶地坐地坐在土階邊上，歪着嘴巴，悠悠閒閒地吸着香烟。起初看見女人們那樣地忙，在炎天下流汗之後，還要回家來煮飯，還要在吃飯的時候，煩難地招呼小孩，我就簡直對他們生出反感來了：爲什麽男子這般地懶惰呢？後來，因爲苦於蚊子的紛擾，夜間也到田間去走走，碰見他們是在潮退的溝邊，辛苦地夜漁，於是我感到了深深的漸愧，因爲在村中其實眞是懶惰的，倒應該自家承認，原是我自已呵。</p>

<p>— 敦龐</p>
<p>淸代文壇掌故雜錄之五</p>
<p>查夏重，姜西溟，唐東江，湯西崖，宮恕堂，史蕉飲。在輦下爲文酒之會。嘗謂吾輩將來人各有集，傳不傳不傳未可知，惟彼此牽綴姓氏於集中，百年以後，一人傳而皆傳而皆傳矣。文人好名，結習難忘如是。</p>
<p>按：文人好名，而求名之法多矣，但是與其作自傳或自紀曾與廬隱女士打過幾次牌喝過幾次酒，或化名作批評家批評自已的小說好，均不如設法把自已的姓氏綴入他人文集中之佳。自傳固好，但未必能傳，紀廬隱之文及化名之批評家之文亦未必傳，但若有個能傳的文人肯把我的名字綴入他的文中，則雖被駡歟，我的姓氏總是傳定的了。故近有文學家於其刋物上刋一公開信給另一作家，對之挑撥，末了却說：「假如這信是先生覺得有答覆的價値的話，就請寄到這裏ＸＸＸＸ的編者將牠發表，否則希望先生爲文給我一個嚴正的批判也可以。發表的地方我想隨處都歡迎的。」</p>
<p>又按：我讀「淸朝野史大觀」而必註明借自曹聚仁先生處者，也是給曹先生多一個傳的機會之意，丨假如我的文章能傳的話。但不知曹先生肯在他的文章中提出區區的姓氏，說曾經借書給我乎？</p>
<h3 id="c188">我來自東（七） <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>落機山以西，所經過的都是美麗的田野。在哥侖比亞河流域之内，麥田一片，可以和美西瀉碧河流域東西比美。此地最使我注意而佩服的，是他們的溝洫制度。如參議員波拉的故鄕boise城，本來是一塊不毛之地，現在人工造成的水渠，已把這個小城環繞起來。渠的兩旁，綠草靑靑，很和平地像地毯樣舖着。你說這個是城市，不如說牠是極合衛生的公園。誰知道這裏在未加灌漑以前這裏是一片黃滗漠漠的地方。我贊歎物質科學之偉大，因爲牠而才使人類有這樣美麗的地方。偉大的物質科學，牠能替人類從地獄中造出天國來。</p>
<p>從地獄中造出天國，乃是進步民族不斷努力的趨向。在物質建設方面，美國人確有這一種能力和精神。美國西部，是比較開闢遲一點的，然而許多建設事業，已經超過已老的東部。他們能保持着紅印第安人所遺留下的勇敢，冒險，和蠻幹的精神，積着百多年吃苦耐勞的習慣，利用最新的科學發明，而改造他們的物質環境。我羨幕他們，我妬忌他們，我希望太平洋對岸的中國民族，也有同樣的精神和同樣的努力！</p>
<p>加拿大丨英耶？美耶？</p>
<p>五天的汽車，把我從美國極東的大西洋岸，帶到極西的太平洋岸。在一個雨意　　的早上，我再到了三年不見的西雅圖。那是美國最西北的一角。一條三千多哩的征途，已在我雙足的背後消失，我看見了太平洋，在夕陽中西望對着那平時以爲太陽落下的所在的太平洋，似乎我的祖國已是不遠。我彷彿在前面的地平綫上，看見對岸中國的山野的影子。</p>
<p>在這太平洋的一角，很巧妙的排着三座大城，如果太平洋是黑夜的天空，牠們便是天際的三顆明星。西雅圖是南邊的一顆，隔着喬治港向北，東邊是熱鬧的温古華，西邊是很美麗的維多維亞城。在一天二十四小時之内，火車，飛，輪船，汽車，不斷的在這個城市間繞轉，把這三顆小星，凑成一個連環。連環裏面所住着的人民，他們的生活是脈脈相關的。可是不合理的政治界綫，却把這三個城分置於兩面國旗之下。</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>吾嘗說：「人民愛用國貨的程度，通商大埠，不如内地都會，内地都會，更不如窮鄕僻壞」。吾這次南昌之行，更信此言不謬。南昌爲内地都會，交通則自九江之南潯鐵路經行，半天可至，公路汽車，更四通八達。最近自運事委員會蔣委員長行營駐節以來，厲行新生活運動，積極提倡儉樸的生活，因是南昌人民，個個以服用國貨自勉。最近外貨的銷路，一天少似一天，卽以外國疋頭而論、三年前年銷年百萬元，目下不及二百萬元，此外舶來品的銷數，據贛商說，較諸二三年前，僅占三分之一，今後新生活運動效果日大，卽外貨的銷路日少，這種消息，眞是値得欣慰。吾到南昌以後，和中國銀行行長蔡愼齋先生談話，並知南昌商界，目下都有一種抱負，凡是有國貨可以採用的，儘量販賣國貨，這種勇於愛國樂於犧牲的精神，更足爲上海販賣商所取法。復承蔡先生紹介和各商業領袖談話，大家對於上海各國貨工廠的出品，年來有這樣長足的進步，一致表示良好的感想，極願盡力推銷，彼此合作。目下先擬組織一國貨公司，與上海生產界作實際上產銷的合作。不久的將來，不難實現一純粹的中國國貨公司。加入的都是金融界和工商界領袖，和殷實的販賣商，更得地方的信仰。這種愛用國貨的精神，眞値得表揚和景仰的。</p>

<h3 id="c230">洋貨亡國 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>要說「洋貨亡國」，須先講「國貨救國」</p>
<p>「國貨救國」，我們知道已經嚷了多時。但是，時到今日，市面上的「洋貨」，依然是觸目皆是，「國貨救國」的成效，實在等於零！雖然，有識之士，定去年爲「國貨年」，又定今年爲「婦女國貨年」。但是，去年的「國貨年」，結果是一團糟，而今年的這個「婦女國貨年」，十二個月，已經過去了六個月，這六個月裏，「國貨救國」的成績怎樣，據報紙上告訴我們是：「入超」有增無减，尤以娘兒們日常所需的「化妝品」，爲數驚人！唉！這樣的情形，我覺得與其說是「國貨救國」，徒然貽笑外國人，不如直截爽快，老老實實說一聲「洋貨亡國」，倒似乎比較的實際一點吧？</p>
<p>或者說：「國貨救國」的反面，原本來就是「洋貨亡國」。因爲「爲貨」可以「亡國」，纔所以要「國貨」來「救國」啊。</p>
<p>我說「話雖不錯，但是，一方面儘管在那裏嚷着說「國貨救國」，而另一方面却儘管在那裏和「洋貨」結不解緣，這種矛盾的怪象，如果長此下去，不加改革，那麽，終有亡國的一天！試問，這樣的亡國，不是「洋貨亡國」，難道是「國貨救國嗎？」</p>
<h3 id="c231">商店贈品應一律採用國貨 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 褚劍屏</p>
<p>商店用贈品來競爭營業，的確是很有效騐，而且是無損於商業道德的辦法。可是在這全國聲嘶力竭，高呼着提倡國貨的時候，大家應當一律採用完全國貨做贈品。否則便不免要令人指摘和譏笑。</p>
<p>近來某綢緞局，爲了優待顧客的原故，贈飲Ｘ國ＸＸ牌鮮橘水。這本來是無足深怪的事情，但是我不知道他們爲什麽一定要屏棄了價廉物美的國貨不用，而甘願出了很貴的代價，去替外商擴充營業，廣事宣傳？難道國貨中竟没有上品的橘子水嗎？</p>
<p>本來，中國糟到了現在的地步，無論那一個國民，再不容稍存嫉視之心了；而工商兩界，尤其要同心恊力，相輔而行。凡廠家供給商店做贈品的貨物，其價格應當較平常批發尤廉；因爲商店直接固然是招攬自已的主顧，而簡接却在代贈品的製造者，播施廣告的效力。</p>
<p>唉！誠實的經理們啊！時勢已經不容你們坐視了，快些合作起來吧！</p>
<p>唉！總而言之，希望今年這個「婦女國貨年」，不可再像去年那個「國貨年」，那樣的糟！但顧大家快快努力，提倡「國貨」打倒「洋貨」，庶幾「洋貨亡國」，不致眞的成爲事實，那眞功德無量！</p>
<h3 id="c232">在都市裏尤宜提倡國貨 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>提倡國貨，擾攘了好些時候，說他有效嗎？海關的統計表上，洋貨不住地增高。說他没有功效嗎？好幾爿國貨公司，生意倒並不退板，這未免令人莫明其妙。其實愛用國貨的人，到底因了提倡而熱度增高一些。至於還有些人，仍是拚命地推銷洋貨，任你舌敝唇焦，他們無動於中，這等人我可掉一句文說：「叔寳全無心肝」。現在有許多人，在主張提倡國貨，先從鄕村入手。不錯！這層意思，我也想到。因爲全中國的區域，鄕村居多。只要鄕村中全用國貨，便在熱閙的都會裏，仍用洋貨，爲數亦屬有幾。在下在十年以前，跟隨了幾個熱心君子，帶了許多國產貨物，到内地去遊行勸說。許多鄕人，雖是在聽了你勸導之後，略爲購買一些。他們是敷衍你的面子；也可以說爲了半送半賣的緣故，來市一些便宜，所以結果是失敗。因了這一來，我的思想便改變，在鄕間提倡果然要提倡，而加重的工作，還宜施之於都榻，因爲都市裏愛用甚麽，各鄕鎭自會倣效。「城中好高髻，四方高一尺」。這一句話眞是不錯的。</p>
<p>人生最離不掉的三件事，當然是「衣」「食」「用」。先拿穿的衣服來說：歐美各地的人，以巴黎的式樣爲標準巴黎地方時行些甚麽，别處地方也跟而倣效。中國當然是要推上海了，上海盛行了甚麽，漸漸的推廣到蘇州杭州，以至於偏僻的鄕村。倘使都市裏的摩登仕女，花樣不論怎樣的翻新，衣料悉用國貨。内地和鄕村的人們，這時用不着去勸導，他自會跟着路走。此外吃的用的，也何莫而不是這樣呢？</p>
<p>都會裏的人們呀！你們是全國人們的導師，也是全國人們的表率。你們愛用國貨，全國的人們，也會起來愛用。倘使你們愛用洋貨，偏要内地的人單用國貨，那是不可能的事，而且理上也說不過去呀！</p>
<p>一週間國貨界新訊</p>
<p>（一）國際貿易局訊：桐油爲我國特產物，每年輸往日本爲數頗鉅，朝鮮總督府爲防止是項輸入，决定設法獎勵種植桐樹，已在全南濟州島試種，作有計劃有組織之培植，我桐油市塲，將來必有被奪之虞，國人應加以注意。</p>
<p>（二）陜西省主席邵力子，綏靖主任楊虎城，發起籌備西安國貨公司，上海方面，特請杜重遠君專程西上，籌備一切，頃得來電，謂公司卽可成立。</p>
<p>（三）前年譚常愷在湘建廳長任内，試騐煤氣汽車成功，現長沙至湘潭段公路，卽專駛煤氣汽車。自余籍傳繼任廳長後，繼續研究以酒精代汽油之酒精汽車，現正由專家籌辦，八月間中國經濟學會在長沙開會前，將造成數輛，以備招待乘坐，藉以表示湘省建設成績。聞此車成功之後，湖南全省公路，卽可專駛煤氣及酒精兩項汽車，無須再用汽油矣。</p>
<p>（四）中華工業總聯會錢承緒君近自瑞士來函，歷述參觀彼邦四大工廠辦理之優點，指示中國產業界之弊病，並主張華廠應先從整理商品入手，然後再圖擴充。</p>
<p>（五）本市中美商界組織之中國工業品出口行，爲向國外推銷我國貨品起見，特搜羅各廠出品共一百五十笙，公開陳列，邀各界參觀，並於十八日派員赴南洋各埠，實行推銷。</p>
<p>（六）鎭江省會國展會，已於昨日（二十五）開幕，本市參加者一百二十餘家，赴會代表劉仲英等，由中華國產廠商聯會領導，於廿二日早車赴鎭，頻行發表宣言。</p>
<p>（七）上海機聯會近分函全國各省都市旅社飯店及各國貨團體，請懸國貨標本，使旅客按圖索驥，並附送國貨樣本一册。</p>

<p>— 倩紅</p>
<p>在没有批評這一次培德領帶公司的陳設之前，請先把陳設領帶的兩種方法說一說。</p>
<p>狹長的領帶陳設在整個的櫉窗中，要求美麗而能惹看，非把牠們凑集在一起不可。凑集以後，牠纔有刺激力，牠纔能吸引在牠陳設所在走過的人們的視綫，牠纔能呌陳設者收穫廣告的效果。所以陳設領帶的設計原是不大容易的。若應用純直綫或曲直綫兩重奏的方法來陳設領帶，似乎比較地能於成功。</p>
<p>培德領帶公司這次在華美烟公司舉辦的國貨陳設橱窗競賽的橱窗中，似乎没有注意到從領帶本身可以形成的美妙的圖案，也没有注意到顏色和花樣的凑集。這眞是非常可惜的一件事。他們的陳設是側重於量和商標兩方面，所以刺激力的集中，全仗勞萊與哈台兩個西洋電影明星的頭頸下面垂着的兩條領帶，來做全橱窗陳設的主體。自然，滑稽的晝像，雖僅僅兩個頭，我想也是很别致而易引人注意的罷。他們的註册商標是一隻黑貓，在撥弄絃琴的姿態上，滑稽的意味更濃厚了。</p>
<p>因爲他們偏重於量的方面，所以各種花樣的領帶，陳設殆滿。顏色方面是以淡色爲主體，因爲現在是炎熱的夏季啊。</p>
<p>末了，華美烟公司這次自已的窗飾是很富麗的。他們把綠黃藍紅四種綢的顏色，來代表他們四種的香烟。入夜光芒四射，確是富有刺激力的。他兩家究竟那一家來得高妙，那便全在於各入的觀點如何了。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>有時候，伊實在覺得無事可做了，偶然也一個人獨自弄弄紙牌，我們便站在伊的背後，替伊留心看着；如其伊自已有錯亂的時候，就從旁指點指點。還有伊需要用一副眼鏡，或一支烟斗，或其他相類的零星小東西，而這些東西又是安放得很近，不須費多大工夫，就可以取到的話；我們便走過去，替伊取了來。要是這些東西恰巧安放在一個遠處，拿起來比較費力一些；這樣，就讓那些宮女去幹了。總之，凡有比較費力一些的工作，便由宮女們去承當，我們當女官的儘可不管。</p>
<p>請你們原諒我，大膽的說一句誇口的話，我們這八個女官，雖然性氣各人不同，但都有一副很好看的相貎。這句話也許根本是多說的，不過和事實尙無多大差别，所以我就直截了當的說了！我們所用的頭飾是完全相同的；但各人所穿的衣服，却竭力的避免雷同。不但式樣决不互相倣傚，便是衣料的顏色，也不使他們衝突的。譬如今天已有人穿了一件淡紅的衣服，其餘的七個人，便不能再穿這種顏色。所以當我們八個人站在一起的時候，旁人看了，少不得要讚一聲好看；就是我們自已看了，也很得意，尤其是因爲我們大家年紀都還輕，一經打扮，便個個都出落得十分的美麗了！</p>
<p>每天晚上，在太后睡熟的時候，我們也得有一個人在伊臥室裏侍候着；因爲這是比較吃力的是使的緣故，我們是輪流着値班的。每人隔七天輪到一次，習慣了也還不覺得如何辛苦。但當太后未曾熟睡之前，在旁邊服侍伊的人，却必須隨意和伊說話，一直到伊自已鼾聲大作爲止。幸而這一段程序並不需要多少時候，所以大家都還對付得過。更造化的是伊倒從没有害過失眠症，否則可就糟了！（九一）</p>

<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>用中國字印成新聞紙，至今還存在的，大家都推申報作老大哥。</p>
<p>因爲他今年已經六十二歲了。但是程瞻廬先生告訴我，香港還有一種「循環日報」，去年舉行過七十周年紀念，印了一本紀念册，上面還有創始人王韜的照片。那麽比申報要長九歲，應當把他稱爲老大哥。因爲他銷不到内地來，所以大家都不知道。</p>
<p>據南京的朝報說，澳門地方，發行中國新聞紙最早，大槪大咸同之間，（？）可惜都是短命而死，又是爲文化落後，商業中心移轉的關係，没有後起之秀，所以大家連這一點歷史的印象也消逝了。</p>
<p>說起新聞紙在中國，唐時已有「雜報和「邸報」兩種，前者發見於孫可之文集：後者發見於全唐詩話。雜報是否卽是邸報？不得而知，但是他們的内容，可以推想而得，和清代的宮門抄差不多的。宮門抄是由内閣抄下來，用木版印刷的，每天晚上分送京官，每月給送報人四弔錢。後來有了新聞報，可以託報販帶送，每月給兩弔錢就够了。内容只是當日公布的上諭，和召見官員的題名，外省重要官員到京的題名，没有多大意味的。</p>
<p>「秋水生之考據學」引趙叔朝野類要，載有「朝報每日由後省編定，其有所謂内探省探衙探者，皆衷私小報，有漏洩之禁，故隱而號之曰新聞。」後省不知道是什麽政治機關？「探」倒狠像現在的「訪員。」我在童年，瞧見有人敲小鑼，賣傳單式的小新聞紙也稱「朝報，」和朝野類要所說的朝報，名同實異，或者是民間模信着編印的，所載的都是社會新聞，倒狠合「衷私小報」之意的。</p>

<p>— 梅雪</p>
<p>蘇州人的口頭禪，一天總得說幾個會字，今朝會，明朝會，曼歇會，碰頭會，任何人的口頭，總是說來很熟的，誰料却是合年亢旱時節的預讖。小子是生長在民國時代的，物質文明的眼福，當然享受了不少，惟有抬着偶像出會游行，却是見所未見，只不過聽聽老年紀人談談前清時代「三節會」的盛况罷了。這數十天的亢旱，若了老農，却便宜了小子，便宜些什麽？便是天天有會看，看了今朝會，又看明朝會，看了晏歇會，又看碰頭會。誰也想不到爲着求雨問題，蘇州城廂内外的泥塑木雕大活動，區區梅雪，可以飾看這「開倒車」式的偶像賽會。</p>
<p>出了關帝會，又出猛將會，畢竟猛將面子大，出會以後便灑了一陣毛毛雨。善男信女這般說：「關帝闖不進南天門，所以求雨無效，猛將曾封上天王，他是玉皇大帝的外甥，可以直入南天門，嬲着他娘鼻降些雨水，所以猛將一出堂，天空便有雨意了。」這般見神見鬼的痴話，迷信者聽了點頭播腦，梅雪聽了，只算他在後宰門放砲。</p>
<p>馬夫崇拜的馬王廟，前天便有盛大的賽會，全城的馬匹都加入賽會之中，「馬明王」的旗　，隨風飄揚，闊哉！闊哉！但據小子看來，蘇城的廟宇，馬王廟以外，尙有牛王裏，蛇王裏，倘使如法泡製起來，牛王會中可以排一個火牛陣，蛇王會中可以排一個長蛇陣。再者，廟堂巷中，有一座壁蝨大王廟，倘使壁蝨大王也來出會求雨，全蘇城的臭蟲，只怕没有加入的可能吧。</p>
<p>讓皇和姜太公同日出會，讓皇何人，便是周文王的伯父吳泰伯，論到資格，當然高出太公之上。兩起賽會在中道相逢，論理，太公當讓泰伯，泰伯不當讓太公，但是那天的結果，吳泰伯反而辟道，由着手執杏黃旗的姜尙，大模大樣的呵殿而過，這是禮節上所不應該的。然而燒香人替老姜辯護，以爲「姜太公逢官加一級，遇見吳泰伯，當然不賣帳了」。</p>

<h3 id="c273">革命先革心變政先變俗 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 岑</p>
<p>行營秘書長楊永泰不久在收復各區善後講習會演講「革命先革心，變政先變俗」。大意謂中國之亂，都由人心不好，所以要改造中國，必須先改造人心，而改革政治，又必須從改革社會之人情風俗始，因此，一二人的在上移風易俗，澈底做一番革心工夫，在今日是必要的。洋洋萬餘言，有首有尾，眞可謂是現時的一篇煌煌巨著。其說理之精，有非其他人所可及的。在今日風俗敗壞，人心萎靡的現狀下，這也許可算得是一個有力的針砭罷。</p>
<p>中國今日的人心，確乎是已經壞到極點了。在上者貪汚自私，卑鄙齷齪，無所不爲，在下者則蠅營狗苟，投機取巧，謟媚成風。人間幾乎已不知有羞恥二字。地位越高，其無恥也越利害。至於一般小百姓，則每天都是過着饑寒凍餒的日子，可憐他們要吃飽一頓飯，有如登天之難。貧窮壓壞了每個小百姓，現在每個小百姓都在饑餓貧窮線以下過日子。這社會的風氣，確乎是太不好了。非得有一番澈底改造的工夫，中國社會，簡直無法得救的，中國整個民族，也無法得到解放。因此，改革中國社會，在今日誠然是非常必要。</p>
<p>然而我還有一點意見。革命先革心，變政先變俗，應該先從那裏着手呢？我以爲應該先從上層着手。因爲前面已經說過了，現社會中最無恥，人心最壞的人，是一些有地位的上層份子，卽將委員長及楊永泰氏等所痛惡的一些無恥的貪汚的官僚。這些貪污無恥的官僚，才是中國今日風氣最壞的主動者，要改造風氣，要革心，我以爲應首先從這班人革起，從這班人改造起。這才是根本的辦法。至於一班草味小民，如前面所說的，他們吃一頓飯還是困難，貪汚無恥，在他們似乎說不到罷。就是有，也不過是要飯吃的問題，這不涉及貪汚無恥的範圍，可以不論。這樣，改造人心，第一就應先從上層份子做起了。這一點，事實上是無可疑的。</p>
<p>其次，關於一班小民的問題。現在一班小民，大家都鬧着没飯吃。在没飯吃的情形下，什麽禮敎，法律，他們確乎也有時顧不到許多的，這誠然有點不法。然而這不法却完全由於饑餓，與官僚的貪汚，有遠遠的區别。解决的方法，似應從怎樣給他們都有飯吃一點上着手。單單法律制裁，或是斬殺，似乎是没有用罷。吃飯問題解决，其他問題，自然也可連帶都解决。這是一個根本問題。這問題不解决，其他意見，恐怕都會變成空說。</p>
<p>革命先革心，變政先變俗，在今日誠然是十分必要的。然而怎樣去革心，怎樣去變俗，倒是一個不能不先予研究的問題。如小民吃飯的問題，驟看不重要，其實却極重要。假使没有飯吃，還談什麽禮敎道德呢？所以最緊要的問題，還是在怎樣先給他們以飯吃。</p>
<h3 id="c274">雜要者 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 清</p>
<p>在曠塲上，圍攏着一大羣男的女的，被圍在圈子裏邊的是一個高個子的身體結實的大漢，和一個瘦瘦的小伙伴。那大漢露着赤膞胳，皮膚是黧黑的，黑得發光。張起了尖嗓音，哇啦哇啦的嚷着，手裏拿着兩根木棍在來往地揮動，做着一些花樣給人們瞧一面呌，一面在圈子裏邊跑來跑去。小伙伴敲着銅鑼子，漢子喊了一句，他便跟着尾音呌了一聲，而又把銅鑼子使勁地擂了一陣。地面上橫七竪八的雜攤着許多東西，中央擺了幾隻碗子，並在上邊蓋一塊紅布。而稍爲能够使人們停一停腿子擠上來看看的就是這個了。同時在他們自已亦是成爲唯一的保守的秘密。他們先是拚命的嚷，拚命的打銅鑼。目的無非是想能多吸引一些觀客，可以多收點效果。因爲戲法雖然多得狠，究竟花樣是有限的，而且不能輕易地來了一個又一個。可是圍着瞧的人們的趣味是十分急促的，他們一時爲了那鬧得振天響的呌嚷和銅鑼聲便跨上去凑凑熱鬧，不過是偶然的好奇心的鼓動而已。一瞥見那一大一小的兩傢伙在没完没結的胡鬧了半天，還不見做出什麽樣子來。一股勁都漸漸地消失了。况且大家誰不曉得那是騙人的勾當。只是好奇，所以亦甘心受騙一下。然而在做戲法的人是不曾顧慮到這一點。那漢子吵了一陣子。就不再吵了。却另外換了一種姿態，突忽的縐着眉，哭着臉的望着週圍的人們說道：先生，請做做好事，給個把銅板吧。我們整天還没得吃喝。給個把銅子，馬上就來變戲法，他一邊說，一邊手指着地下那塊布。</p>
<p>但是銅了的影見根本便瞧不見，他們是希望大家先把銅子再變戲，而站着的人們則是要先瞧瞧戲法到底怎樣變，給不給似乎尙須要一番考慮的。看這情形，漢子的臉色是格外陰沉起來，在大衆之前暎了一口氣。於是又强裝着笑嘴，照樣的來那麽一套，口中唸唸有詞。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>揮着棍子，跑來跑去，小伙伴在旁邊打着銅鑼子，神情可没有剛才的活躍了。</p>
<p>這樣地繼續了許久的時間，在某一個時間中又停了，收了嗓音，伸着手跟人們要銅子，差不多有四五回了。而戲法始終不做出來，在無形中已經把每一個人心中僅有的興緻全弄冷了。大有漸由失望感到憤怒而厭惡，有人帶着駡走子。　着走的人越來越多了。大漠子瞧着更加着急，他頻頻搥着胸脯，苦苦的求乞着；老爺們做做好事，賜個把銅子吧。他自已說了後，可呌着小伙伴跪下去，跟着他一起哀求着。到最後那大漢子自已索性亦巴巴的兩膝跪着。但是依然不見有人掉出銅子來，而祇引起了一陣冷酷的恥笑。大家都有了這末的一種感想，他們是來看戲法的，並不是來看呌化子表演。</p>
<p>於是哀求的僅管哀求，走的人儘管走。而那哀求的的聲息一直等到所有的人們散光的時候，才消失下去，但又另外流動在别一個地方去了。</p>

<p>「醫生」顧名思義，自然是使病人生的，可是大多數是使病人死的。</p>
<p>「懸壼濟世」的醫生，本來是要救人，「縣壼濟世」成了職業的醫生，便不想救人了。</p>
<p>有藥童出身的西醫生，有不懂脈理不懂藥性的中醫生，一病便醫死的人難怪不少。</p>
<p>請醫生要掛號錢要出診金，進醫院要房錢，窮人一生病十人中九死一生。</p>
<p>窮人要等金錢來活性命，富人的性命却常常被金錢所害。</p>
<p>有自已不能够理髮的理髮匠，所以理由充足說，亦有自已不能够醫病的醫生。</p>
<p>如果醫生醫死了人得償命，不知道還有人敢做醫生麽？</p>
<p>醫死了病人還不明白那　　是什麽病的醫生，醫好了一個病人，他的醫理說得特别精博。</p>
<p>没有殺不死人的劊子手，因此没有醫不死人的醫生。</p>
<p>不可救藥的病人，有的醫生醫他快死，有的醫生醫他多苦幾天。醫他快死的醫生受人駡，醫他多苦幾天的醫生成了名。</p>

<p>— 道</p>
<p>睜開眼睛又閉下去，不久又張開來，這樣地在牀上來往翻側着，老早便醒的，自然不會再睏了過去，祗不過是用這方法挨過時間，一直到肚子餓的不能忍耐，才不得不溜下來。這時太陽已高高懸在中天，是快近正午了。在各處搜索一番，所有的財產不够一角錢，今天如何解决呢？</p>
<p>借些錢吧！除此别無第二條路，可以質當的東西都當光了，不走這條路，難道當眞能够癟着肚過日子不成。但是一想起那些有錢的人們的臉龐，週身就不覺冷子半截·可是祗好硬着頭皮去碰碰看啊！</p>
<p>草草地揩了揩臉孔，便跑出來了。</p>
<p>在六月的炎炎的毒太陽底下，就像浸在火盆裏一樣，而我還載着一件厚厚的駱駝絨袍子，是的，它竟成爲我唯一的伴侶，往外是身無長物的。每一個從身邊擦過去的順流的逆流的陌生路的人，都張着奇異的眼光望我釘了幾下。從這許多眼光裏，我玩味到兩種不同的感想，一種大約會準以爲我是害傷寒症，怕受冷的；一種却明顯帶着輕蔑的鄙夷了。他們看看我這六日天穿棉襖的窮光棍之後，同時就驕傲地回顧一下自已身上絲質的綢質的薄薄的應時裝束；覺得有無限的榮耀，接着臉上便浮出一絲得意的微笑，尤其是一班高貴的小姐們赤着兩脚，膝子到胸兜那兒亦是裸的。他們的，土披里純更不必說了。於是我微微感受到難堪的侮辱，由侮辱的激盪生出一種痛恨和憤怒。然而一轉念間，反又釋然了。你們神氣你們的，我行我的，一切跟我没烏關係，犯着冒火？享樂的日子不是永遠不破减的，，終會有一天讓我踏在這些狗兒們的腦袋上，大大的蹧蹋一塲吧。</p>
<p>儘繼續走我的路，不再思索那些，也不再瞧那些無聊的嘴臉，當那些瞥不見一樣，一邊走，一邊在心里邊計劃着用什麽話和什麽方法準得達到借錢的目的。天氣明眞是熱煞人的，加上穿了那麽一床被頭似的長袍，簡直要發昏一般，内襯衫完全給汗水濕透，每雙毛孔拚命的，出汗珠，額頂問的汗顆子更是如急雨樣的不停流下來。</p>
<p>好容易才到了，所要借錢的人的家，然可是跨進門，劈顯看見室内許多箱囊之類的行李，大家都在忙脚忙手，便問一問，原來是主人馬上要回故鄕，聽着，整個勁兒卽刻冷下來，這怎麽辦，當這時候，還可以開口說這個麽。眼見着絡絡續續一個個帶了禮物來送行的人，我則獨例外，想想着，這個無論怎樣萬萬說不得的。瞧模樣是絶望了。况且整半天尙未有嚥過粒米，眼底儘在一陣陣的繚亂着。而爲了支撑塲面，知道是非送主人下船後走不了的，於是我便坐針氈一樣等着等着。這時間我的感覺是全失落的。</p>
<p>主人出來了，見了我，笑着打招呼，我毫無情感地站上來點點頭，當其發見我穿着。那麽一套長袍的時候，忽然像狠關懷地問：這樣熱的天，你還穿這個，可是身體有毛病？</p>
<p>「晤，晤。」祗支晤地答着，呌我怎樣說呢？</p>
<p>在路上招領來的侮辱現在又重新受到了。雖然問的人也許是出自好意，可是我終以爲是惡毒的。</p>
<p>送主人下船的時候，在船上，在一羣人中間，主人還連連那樣地問我到底是不是身體不好。這敎我如何應付呢？得了吧，便承認有毛病，不過卽是如此，也還是不能把掉醜的情景掩遮啊！人與人間的冷酷和薄情在這一天之内是嗜遍了，而這種相同於侮辱的印象比較在路上陌生者所賜予的更深創列不易使我忘記啊。</p>
<h3 id="c277">詞窮 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 流螢</p>
<p>每天的麵包要從筆底下掘出來，墨水缸裏的墨水乾枯了，筆尖也毁壞了，腦袋已被尼古丁刺激得麻木，血肉之軀，倒底不是加了汽油就能推動的機器，呆坐在寫字台前，時間在窗外的白雲中像箭一般的溜過。</p>
<p>詞窮了。</p>
<p>寫私人的生活起居注，已被人反對「難道在這麽的中國，在這樣的時代，就没有一點重要的資料供一個副刋的編者的採登嗎？况且那些文章所記术宾大半是些捕風捉影之談，有些甚至是閉門創造的結果。拿這些虚僞的消息供　讚者，似乎是一個編者所不應該的罷。」</p>
<p>然而你應該寫時代的作品了，打倒資本家！全世界的勞動者聯合起來！這要得嗎？誰不怕吃麵包的傢伙搬塲？</p>
<p>所以風行一時的頽毁，浪漫作品是寫文章的上策。美麗的小白鴿呵！女人的性慾部分啊，情書一束，再束，可以生財無窮。於是許多人都談起女人來，以爲這是四方無碍，八方太平的取荆州，但是那個他閉了雙目從接吻上可以辦别異性種族的談女人大家哥德派拉，就碰過一鼻子灰，和國產的摸屁股同樣不是生意經。</p>
<p>最好的題材自然是抓人家的腦袋來開刀，事實儘管離開本題十萬八千里，從許多大帽子下冲醬油湯，幾十個翻身之後，使讀者辦别不出這倒底是什麽味道。不過就是被「特殊者羣」包辦了的，你如果站在他們敵對的戰綫上，那不是「漢奸」，便是「間諜」，這種文字可寫而不可寫也！</p>
<p>也有人告訴我最好不動筆，無論這　　　至如何地步，不要動，一動也不要動一動！辦法當然是好的，譬如中了頭奬之後把藏奬券的槓棒投諸黃浦江中，離開筆底下掘麵包出來的宗旨太遠了。而且香烟價格很貴，何必買毒汁來殺睚家呢？</p>
<p>詞窮了，倒底怎樣辦呢？答語是山谷中的回聲，倒底怎樣辦呢？</p>

<p>名人與聖人，其本質和長成固不同，但其成功後之效用則一：因爲人旣成爲名人矣，看來樣子似無所不通，無所不曉，開口閉口，非仁則義，一方落地，則被大家爭奉，到處傳播，而所言所見，又莫不被大家認爲至理，恭誠遵行。一個金融界巨頭，他能闡明醫學原理，一個軍事界領袖，他能痛論敎育是非，一個文學界權威，他能高談國防計劃，……原因就是他們是名人之故。</p>
<p>近日没有看見聖人出現，關心世道者，常不覺悲歎不幸；然，已有了這麽多萬知萬能我名人，還何需乎聖人？</p>

<p>— 欲歸</p>
<p>到這裏已三天了，忙着東奔西走拜謁故鄕的父老，簡直没有餘裕的時間寫信給你。今天是先祖的忌辰，已是七年没有盡小輩三跪的責任了，父親隔晚就告訴我，所以今天午後能安閑地在家裏坐一天。午飯時到家的祖祠堂裏，古舊的屋子更顯得衰老了，微微地傾斜着，　角都禨蜘蛛繼佔據了，正顯水出　落原的没落現象。祖先的神偉　在正中央，我虔誠地燃了香燭，叩過了頭，我父親仍木然地站在一邊。他大槪想起了建造宗祠時的榮顯吧？那時候我剛二歲，後來我進了私塾之後，他每餐酒罷要我輩坐在他太師椅的旁邊，演講當時開工建造的情形。他不厭求詳地從我方面演述，其實我是不明白像他所講的那樣多，彷彿聽着一個動人的故事。然而後來屢次的演述，像聽我家長工講「從前一家人家」似的討厭了；不過我還是安靜地瞧着父親得意的笑答，爲了有許多酒後的菜肴！像毛荳，花生之類，供我細細地咀嚼。父親自已呢，抽着旱烟袋，撫摩着頦下稀稀的鬍鬚，可見他的講述，並不要他的七八歲的兒子知道怎樣建造一所偉大的宗祠，是把這顯嚇的故事演述出來，使自已感到分外的快感，而將自已的兒子，就擴充一個聽講的對象了。</p>
<p>現在，我瞧見他站着半响不動，我憐情　　　從前　有　奇　　　　的　　裏。我想要　　將事時的情刑　　細地講我聽一次。</p>
<p>在寂寞的悲哀中我們離了宗祠到家，午飯父親喝酒了。父親本來嗜酒若命，最近幾年來母親告訴我他突然禁酒，問他也不說出理由，今天他又突然想到喝酒，母親似乎想問，但終於没有勇氣。父親是没有表情，像被深深的悲哀壓迫着，一壼酒在平時一半的時間内喝完了。他的臉色緋紅，神經稍稍興奮，沉着地開口了。</p>
<p>「你出門了七年，在七年之内，我們的鎭上是大大地更變了，就是我們一家也客落到這般地步。你小時候我天天講起建造宗祠的情形，你總還留着一點影像。你祖父當時何等的顯嚇，由他赤手空拳創立起我們姓Ｘ的門楣，他又恐怕將來嗣屬的衰落，辦了一所義莊，更大興土木建造宗祠。但是現在義莊被不肖的子孫的盜，賣的賣了；宗祠頽毁了，子孫没有一個能繼續他老人家的　柴的，都不知道　朱創立的英　，　票　賭，於長六公公爲了訓斥三房裏的興官</p>

<p>，氣出一塲大病來，至今没有起床……你呢，族中都看得起你，說你有志讀書，現在大學畢業了，我也再没有錢來培植你了，我不想你做官做什麽，祇要能重振我的姓Ｘ的家聲，還不負我一片苦心……」</p>
<p>父親把酒杯裏殘餘的酒一口氣喝盡了，就回房去睡在床上，母親問他要吃飯不？他没有理會。他是那樣地希望着他的兒子做一個重振家聲的大偉人，但是這希望恐怕永遠是個幻夢吧？</p>
<p>我不忍想，不忍看父親没有一絲笑容而多皺紋底臉！</p>

<h3 id="c281">這也是環境壓迫麽？ <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我有一位知已朋友，受環境壓迫態度甚爲消極，接他近日來信，辭語悽愴，令人不忍卒讀，若不替他設法，難免有自殺之虞。他是一個舊式家庭的男子，兄弟二人，他居長，現年二十三歲，在十九歳的時候，由父母之命，媒妁之言，結了婚，結婚之後，卽去日城求學。到初中畢業時，他父親很不願意他再升學，因他父親在鄕間有一商店，没人帮忙，無論甚麽事情，都由自已一人經理，心想要他回來帮助。但我這位朋友，天資聰敏，文學優良，並且志氣甚大，不但不願意棄儒就賈，且見Ｃ城的學校辦理不善，心想往北平升學，力求上進。後經托朋友向他父親請求，才達其目的，因日城學校程度比北平學校低，他到了北平的時候，降低一級，纔考取某著名中學。但到高中二年級，不幸有兩科不及格，不能升班，該校素來嚴格，學生有兩科不及格，無論如何不能升級。他因經濟及年齡關係，萬不能再留級，然該校辦理優良，又不願意離開此校。在這種情形之下，他自已不能自决，心想在暑假旋里一行，請示父親，如何辦法。但他回想上來時，經許多艱難挫折，才達到目的，今不能升級，冒然回去，一則恐没有再上來之希望，二則受人指摘，無面見父親，現在他進退維谷，未知怎樣處置，整天縐眉蹙額，鬰鬰不樂。素知先生才學優長，諒必樂意指敎，草此，敬懇，並祝</p>
<p>撰安　黎文雄謹上</p>
<p>答；我覺得「你的知已朋友」，爲了不能再在該校讀書，就頽唐得如此，眞是太不値得。不能繼續在該校讀書就算了，這又用得着煩悶麽。因爲學校不好，就說在這種學校裏是讀不好書的，非換一個學校不可，因爲没有機會進學校就說自已没有求學的機會，這些都是没出息的想頭，完全不知道求學是怎麽一回事。須知學是要自已去求的，有學校可入固然求學便利些，没有學校可入，了不是没有求學的機會。一個人祇要肯學，他自已就能創造出求學的環境，愛迪生是大家知道的，他並没有入過什麽大學，但是他畢竟成功了一個科學家。當然，他研究科學是要比理科大學生艱難困苦些，但因他立志堅决，終於克服了那些困難。研究科學是要有實騐設備的，假如我勸一個並通人去自學自然科學，他一定要說，我没有機會進學校去實騐，讓我自學自然科學，也祇是你說得好聽而已。」但愛迭生當初他卻不因爲這種困難而阻止了他的志向，他祇是想克服的辦法。没有實騐設備就自已將生活刻苦，積下錢買一付。所以我覺得令友不必過分留戀，重視學校，不進學校是阻止不了他求學的，我卻希望他能够自已嚴重反省，看看自已以往讀書還有不努力的和精力浪費地方没有，如有，以後就要更加勉勵刻苦，力求改善，至於不能再進某著名中學，或者不能進學校，這些我都以爲不成問題的。我們不能把自已當做鴨子，希望受點「塡鴨式」的敎育，求學是和魚在水中吃水一樣，要自已在水中游泳用自已的嘴，去吸取有用的食料。</p>

<p>— 保加利亞伊凡·瓦卓夫作楊森譯</p>
<p>到了早晨，存娜很早地走到敎堂裏去。她拿着斯託揚送給她的那個法朗，買了蠟燭，在聖耶的每一個聖像前點上一根。當她回來的時候，她好像没有以前那麽悲哀了。</p>
<p>「今天是聖誔節，所以他一定會回來的……聖母瑪麗亞呀，把他送回給我吧！我自已的親愛的天使……我主耶魠，恩惠我呀！」</p>
<p>她的女兒琪娜報告村中有些人門回來了。這位母親的面孔變得更陰鬰了。</p>
<p>「去迎你的哥哥，像旁的女孩兒們一樣。」她怒惱地對着琪娜說。</p>
<p>「我也要去，媽媽，」拉杜喬說，於是兩孩子走到遮着雪的街上去了，離開村市，冒險走上了大路。母親停在門口，等候着。</p>
<p>一陣冰雪的風是從山頂上吹下來，山谷和平原全深深地掩蓋着雪。一個憂鬰的天空。一羣烏鴉飛過了大路，或是棲息在樹頂上。那到伊遲蒂寗去的大路上，各處都是黑點，表示等候着兵到來的人羣；那些都是少女，兒童以及老婦人。因爲兵士們仍然不斷地來着，有的獨自一個人，有的三兩成羣。琪娜和拉杜喬經過了第一羣人，其次第二羣，再第三羣，遠遠地站在路上等候着。他們想最先生斯託揚見面。雖然天落着雪幾乎迷了他們的眼晴，他們要立刻認識出他來。那條路一直伸展到小山上，消失在那一端，琪娜和拉杜喬一直達到山頂，那里的風是更加强烈，阻止他們再前進了。兩個滿身是雪的兵士走過去了，但其中没有一個是斯託揚。</p>
<p>「後邊還有兵士們來麽？」琪娜問。</p>
<p>「我們不曉得，小孩子。你在等着誰？」</p>
<p>「我們的哥哥。」於是路人走過去了。</p>
<p>琪娜仍然向前望着。她是冰冷而且戰憟，拉杜喬在呻吟着，但是大哥哥要回來了，他們必須迎接他，否則母親要生氣或是哭泣了。</p>
<p>其次他們看一輛馬車，裏面有兩個人，全是渾身穿着暖和的衣裳。琪娜站立在馬的前面，敎車停住了，「先生，你們的後邊還有兵士麽？」</p>
<p>「我不曉得，我的小鴿子，」那個人回答着，半拿起他的皮帽驚訝地望着這個凍得發紫的小女孩兒。於是馬車向前跑去了。</p>

<p>Discussing Economic Issues in North China</p>
<p>Rumor Says Yin Has Already Come to Shanghai from Dalian</p>
<p>Huang Fu's Trip North Still Undetermined</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Dalian Conference continues today. Yin Tong will go to Moganshan from Dalian to meet with Huang and report on the progress of the negotiations. Chayama will return to Changchun to report to the Kwantung Army headquarters, and then return to Beiping. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong and the Kwantung Army representatives Okamura, Kita, and the Japanese embassy military attaché Chayama have been holding conferences in Dalian for several days, exchanging opinions on unresolved issues in the war zone. Yin proposed the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Great Wall line and the maintenance of security in the war zone, including the replacement of new and old security teams, the reorganization and elimination of Zhao Lei, Liu Zuozhou, and other units, and the crackdown on Japanese and Korean drug traffickers. Regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Great Wall line, the Japanese side only agreed to withdraw Japanese troops within the Great Wall line, referring to the Jianchangying, Taitouying, and Qian'an Saheqiao areas. There was still no clear indication of withdrawing troops stationed in various ports. Regarding security in the war zone, an agreement has been reached, and the content will be announced after a formal meeting. The Japanese embassy military attaché's office received a telegram from Chayama, saying that he would depart on the 26th or 27th to return to Beiping and arrive at the end of the month. It is said that Okamura and Kita are scheduled to leave Dalian tonight to return to Changchun. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu is currently at Moganshan, and telegrams are sent to Beiping from time to time, but the date of his trip north is still undetermined. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Li Zeyi passed through Hangzhou from Moganshan to Shanghai this morning. According to reports, he met with Chairman Huang and briefly discussed issues in North China. Huang is still making detailed plans for the overall situation in North China and has no intention of being passive, and he sends telegrams to Beiping from time to time with instructions. He should be able to return north at the beginning of next month to preside over the overall situation and supervise the handling of various unfinished matters in the North China war zone. Yin Tong is negotiating with the Japanese side in Dalian. Since Okamura has arrived, there is no need to go to Changchun again. He himself will go to Shanghai to wait for a ship to return to Fujian to complete his work, and then return to Shanghai to go north with Huang. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Usami Kan'er, the new director of the South Manchuria Railway and former director of the Puppet Railway Bureau, arrived here from Shenyang this morning and visited Yin Tong in Xingpu to discuss economic issues in North China. (Dispatch from the 25th by the China Union News Agency)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Usami, the new director of the South Manchuria Railway, has also decided to concurrently serve as the director of the Shenyang Railway Bureau. (Dispatch from the 25th by the Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reports, Yin Tong attended the Sino-Japanese representative conference in Dalian and negotiated with Japanese representatives Kita, Okamura, and Chayama on the aftermath of various unresolved issues in the North China war zone. He will soon return south to report to Huang Fu and others on the details and results of the discussions with the Japanese representatives at the meeting. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 28th or 29th. It is rumored that the date of Huang Fu's return north will be decided after Yin Tong's report. (Dispatch from the 25th by the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles report: (1) Although Liu Shi-xun currently holds the nominal position of Counselor to the Political Affairs Committee in Beiping, he has no real work. The rumor that he will be sent as a representative to Guanwai is completely unfounded. (2) The rumor that Ambassador Arima has resigned is completely untrue. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The Dalian Conference did not bring up the expected issues of the armistice agreement and its abolition. It was always a frank discussion on various issues within the armistice agreement area, exchanging opinions. Such meetings will be held frequently in the future. This meeting did not achieve much. The Japanese only pointed out that the Chinese side had some deficiencies in maintaining security in the war zone, and China agreed to improve this in the future. Deputy Chief of Staff Okamura, Staff Officer Kita, and Deputy Adjutant Izumi returned to Changchun by train at 4:00 PM on the 24th to resume their duties. Military Attaché Chayama is scheduled to return to Beiping on the Japanese ship Changping Maru (transliteration) on the 25th. (Dispatch from the 25th by the Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles report: (1) Yin Tong went to Dalian to discuss unresolved issues in the war zone with responsible personnel from the Kwantung Army, such as the entry of security teams, etc. There were no other major tasks. (2) Tao Shangming went to Beidaihe to discuss security issues in the Beidaihe resort area with Commander Ma Yuying. After the matter was completed, he returned to Tangshan and was not assigned to any other place. (3) Although Liu Shi-xun currently holds the nominal position of Counselor to the Political Affairs Committee in Beiping, he has no real work. The rumor that he will be sent as a representative to Guanwai is completely unfounded. (4) The rumor that Ambassador Arima has resigned is completely untrue. (Dispatch from the 25th by the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Dalian) After meeting with Usami, the new director of the South Manchuria Railway, this morning, Yin Tong, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, also held talks with the heads of the Oriental Travel Agency. Yin also changed his schedule to go to Tianjin and took the Dalian Maru, which he had taken to Dalian, back to Shanghai via Qingdao at 11:30 this morning. After arriving in Shanghai, it is said that he will go to Moganshan to meet with Huang Fu, the chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, to report on the meeting with the Kwantung Army representatives. (Dispatch from the 25th by the China Union News Agency)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Because Yin Tong changed his itinerary to Shanghai, Lieutenant Colonel Chayama, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy in Beiping, took the Japanese ship Changping Maru (transliteration) to Tianjin alone at 5:00 PM today. Upon departure, Chayama made the following statement: "There are still many pending issues in North China that need to be resolved. I plan to work hard to resolve these issues in the future. I do not know when Mr. Huang Fu will return to Beiping, but I hope that Mr. Huang will return to Beiping as soon as possible to handle all cases." (Dispatch from the 25th by the China Union News Agency)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Yin Tong held a meeting with the managers of the Oriental Travel Agency and others today to discuss technical issues related to the railway. (Dispatch from the 25th by Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the rumor reported from Dalian yesterday that Japan would only agree to abolish the Tanggu Armistice Agreement after China recognized "Manchukuo" and resolved the issues regarding the Shanghai Incident.

<h3 id="e2">Discussing Methods for Setting Up Checkpoints <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, Zhang Yongnian and Gao Yuanji, accompanied by the heads of the five checkpoints, visited Yin Rugeng at the Jiji District Office to discuss methods for setting up checkpoints for collecting taxes and the issue of compiling tax police. In the afternoon, they convened a meeting of the heads of the checkpoints at the customs office to discuss the direction of progress. It is rumored that Zhang and Gao will not inspect the eastern route for the time being. In the future, the office will be located inside the customs office, and it is scheduled to be formally established and operating in early August. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese are increasingly coveting Xilin Gol League. In early this month, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Doron sent seven Japanese and five Chinese traitors to various banners in Xilin Gol League to investigate the status of mineral resources and record them in detail, with ulterior motives.

<h3 id="e4">Japanese Measures in Northeast China <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Harbin talked about the recent measures taken by the Japanese in Northeast China: (1) In the puppet state's various institutions, in addition to the Japanese being the mainstay, Chinese employees are mostly from Fujian, followed by Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and local people are almost completely eliminated. (2) Gambling is rampant and is of an official nature. All kinds of lotteries are everywhere. (3) The method of dumping Japanese goods is to use tariffs as a barrier. All domestic goods and goods from various countries are rejected. (4) Although the puppet currency is said to be unified, all cash has been withdrawn. Therefore, silver coins from within the customs are more valuable in Guanwai. One silver dollar is equivalent to 1.02 puppet currency or 1.1 Japanese yen. (5) The atmosphere of poison is very strong in Northeast China. Opium is only 25 cents per packet, and the price is extremely low. Their aim is to kill all the people of Northeast China. (6) Chinese shops in Northeast China have been on the verge of collapse in recent years. The Japanese are still speculating and setting up lending institutions to provide capital turnover. The interest rates are extremely high and the conditions are harsh. (7) Two bookstores, XX, received financial assistance from the Japanese giant bookstore and added and deleted the original elementary school textbooks, which were sold in various places and made considerable profits. (8) In order to increase business, the South Manchuria Railway reduced both passenger and freight fares by one-half from July. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Mongolian Political Affairs Committee Forms Cavalry Guard <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Mongolian Autonomous Political Affairs Committee previously issued a notice to various banners, setting a deadline for selecting a number of cavalrymen to come to the committee to form a guard. After receiving the order, the banners closer to the committee have sent teams to the temple to intensify training. More than 40 cavalrymen from the West Ujimqin Banner of Xilin Gol League also arrived at Bailing Temple on the 13th and immediately built felt tents. More than a dozen tents were quickly completed and arranged in order. The felt tents stood in rows, and the population was concentrated, suddenly forming a new emerging city outside the Great Wall.

<p>(Tianjin) The Yilan Barracks of the Japanese Kwantung Army, which has been under construction for two years, has been completed. The barracks is very large, covering an area of up to 2,000 mu. It is adjacent to the Hongkeli Mountains and has a flying field, covering an area of 800-900 mu or more, all of which are civilian land forcibly occupied by the Japanese army. All kinds of equipment in the barracks are complete. On the 21st, the machinery from the Northeast Arsenal and the Jilin Arsenal were moved and installed in the barracks. Troops can be stationed in the two cities at the same time. At this point, Japan has completed its defense against Russia. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>Supplemented Methods for Impeachment, Supervisory Yuan Has Not Complied, Believing There Is No Legal Binding Force</p>
<h3 id="e7">Supervisory Committee Members Zhu Leizhang and Others Issue Statements <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Supervisory Committee members Zhu Leizhang, Liu Eqing, Ba Wenjun, Tian Jiongjin, Zhang Hualan, Li Shijun, Yang Renzi, Li Menggeng, and Le Jingtao issued statements: The supplemented methods for impeachment cases passed by the Central Political Conference were proposed in the name of the Standing Committee. After discussion at the meeting, it was resolved to pass them. Regardless of the content, it can be regarded as a formal expression of the Party's political guidance mechanism. However, this resolution does not currently have legal binding force externally. According to Article 5 of the Central Political Conference Regulations, the explanation specified in the Outline of Political Tutelage Proposal Explanation, and the interpretation that the Central Political Conference is not one of the government's own organs, the National Government is still the highest organ of the state in legal theory. The Central Political Conference should not directly issue orders or handle government affairs. Its intention must reach the National Government, and the National Government must express it externally before it can have legal binding force. According to Article 75 of the Provisional Constitution during the Period of Political Tutelage and Article 5 of the Organizational Law of the National Government, the National Government's expression of intent is the promulgation of laws and the issuance of orders. Therefore, in legal terms, the resolution of the Central Political Conference is the source of laws and orders, but not laws and orders themselves. According to the current system, the enactment and amendment of laws must meet the following requirements before they can have binding force: (1) The Central Political Conference should determine the legislative principles of the draft law in accordance with Item 4 of the Legislative Procedure Outline. (2) The Legislative Yuan should review the content of the draft law in accordance with Item 4 of the Legislative Procedure Outline. The Legislative Yuan may not change the principles set by the Central Political Conference, but may express opinions. (3) The Chairman of the National Government should sign the legally enacted draft law by law and formally promulgate it. (4) Unless otherwise expressly provided to be implemented on the date of promulgation, the promulgated law should take effect when the date of implementation arrives or when the conditions for implementation are met. (5) The law shall not be obviously contradictory to the fundamental law. The fundamental law is the Provisional Constitution during the Period of Political Tutelage passed by the National Assembly and the Organizational Law of the National Government passed by the plenary session of the Central Executive Committee. If the law conflicts with the Provisional Constitution, it shall be invalid in accordance with the provisions of Article 84 of the Provisional Constitution. There are also three requirements for an order to have binding force: (1) The issuance of an order should be signed by the Chairman of the National Government in accordance with Article 75 of the Provisional Constitution during the Period of Political Tutelage and Article 14 of the Organizational Law of the National Government, and it must be countersigned by the president or minister of the relevant Yuan before it can take effect. (2) Orders that are legal in nature, such as regulations, charters, and rules, should take effect when the date of implementation arrives or when the conditions for implementation are met, unless otherwise expressly provided to be implemented on the date of promulgation. (3) The order must not be obviously contradictory to the law. If the obvious contradiction exceeds the scope of possible interpretation, it should not have binding force according to the principles of administrative law. Articles 2, 4, and 5 of the Standards Law for the Enactment of Laws and Regulations originally stipulated that matters that should be stipulated by law, such as the current laws, the procedure for changing or repealing them, and rules, shall not violate or contradict the law. Regarding the Central Political Conference's resolution on the supplemented methods for impeachment cases, the Supervisory Yuan has not received a formally promulgated law or a formally issued order from the National Government, so it is still handled in accordance with current laws and regulations. Previously, the Office of the Civil Service had an official letter stating that the Chairman had instructed to convey the methods resolved by the Central Political Conference to the relevant agencies, but this was only a notification from the Office of the Civil Service to the various agencies, stating that the Central Political Conference had this resolution. The Chairman must sign his name in the manner of promulgating laws and issuing orders in accordance with the Provisional Constitution and the Organizational Law of the National Government before his intention can represent the National Government. All laws and orders require formal acts. A document that has not been signed by the Chairman in the legally prescribed manner, even if it has the words "strictly abide by", does not have binding force. The official letter from the Office of the Civil Service is the expression of the intention of the Office of the Civil Service, not the expression of the intention of the National Government. Therefore, the supplemented methods for impeachment cases resolved by the Central Political Conference do not have legal binding force before the National Government expresses its intention with a law or order, and the various agencies are not bound by it. However, this resolution belongs to the formal expression of opinion of the Party's political and legal guidance mechanism. If the Supervisory Yuan has any opinions on the content of this resolution, it cannot but present them to the Central Executive Committee and request instructions, because the Central Executive Committee is the organ to which the five Yuans are responsible in accordance with Article 15 of the Organizational Law of the National Government, and it is also the organ to which the Central Political Conference is responsible in accordance with Article 1 of the Central Political Conference Regulations. In short, the members of this Yuan have absolutely no doubts about the guiding power of the political conference's resolutions. After the three methods for supplementing impeachment cases decided by the political conference are completed in the legal procedure, the members of this Yuan will only obey. However, since the legal procedure has not yet been completed, it seems that it cannot take effect yet. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The reorganization plan for the Shensing Textile Mill has been drafted. The relevant departments are scheduled to meet on the 27th to review it. The content of the plan is mostly related to the investigation report, and the reorganization opinions are roughly as follows: (1) Completely nationalize it, and the government will be fully responsible for the subsequent profits, debts, and losses. (2) The government will provide loans to only maintain and restore the business, and the economic responsibility will still be borne by Rong Zongjing himself, while the government will be in a supervisory position. It is rumored that this opinion requires both a resolution from the Executive Yuan and Rong's consent. It can only be implemented if both parties consider it appropriate. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>

The exact amount needed needs to be determined after the review is completed and the urgency is identified. The amount, whether more or less, will depend on the actual situation. Moreover, the plans of the provinces this time all focus on addressing the root causes, such as dredging inland rivers, which cannot be done overnight. Therefore, the implementation measures must also be carried out in stages, and the period must also be five or six years. There is no need for such a large amount of money at this time.

<h3 id="e32">The Question of American Fortification in Alaska <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>After the Washington Naval Conference established the principle of the balance of power among the major powers in the Pacific, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan were willing to cease building any naval bases in the Pacific, except for a few special areas, and to halt their massive shipbuilding programs. However, since Japan violated the Nine-Power Treaty, occupied Manchuria, and established military projects on the Caroline Islands, the balance of power in the Pacific was broken, and the Washington Treaty became a scrap of paper in both spirit and fact. It is recently reported that the United States intends to set up a new naval base near Alaska, which is also an inevitable result. As Japan feels this threat, its desire for war may intensify. Sharpening its knives and preparing to fight, it is unwilling to yield. The calamity of war is imminent.</p>
<p>The Alaska Peninsula is separated from Russian Siberia by only the Bering Strait. The Aleutian Islands in the south, numbering 150, are connected to the Kamchatka Peninsula and Alaska like a string of pearls. Japan has long been paying attention to the military value of these islands, and has been sending ships to chart precise sea maps. Last year, the US Navy began sending warships to survey them, preparing to build a naval base. Japan immediately protested. The US Navy has now created maps of this area from aerial photographs. The Aviation Enterprise Investigation Committee of the Army Department released a report a few days ago, further advocating the establishment of a large-scale aviation base on the peninsula and the organization of the islands. Former US Army Air Corps Commander Mitchell even said, "If the United States makes Alaska the center of its air force, it will be able to control the whole world." It is clear that the United States' intention to manage this island is very firm. What we should consider regarding the issue of American fortification in Alaska is whether the United States has the right to implement this plan, and what military impact this plan will have after it is implemented. The Washington Treaty prohibits the signatory countries from building new naval bases in the Pacific. However, according to international precedent, if one signatory country has abandoned its obligations under the treaty, the other party is no longer bound by the obligations of the treaty. When Japan invaded Manchuria, former US Secretary of State Stimson wrote to Senator Borah, stating that the United States' agreement to waive its right to fortify in the Pacific was conditional on Japan's acceptance of the 5:5:3 naval ratio and the preservation of China's territorial integrity and the Open Door policy. Now that Japan has disregarded its treaty obligations, the United States no longer needs to abide by this prohibition with respect to Japan. The problem is that the Washington Treaty is not simply a treaty between the United States and Japan, but also includes the Four-Power Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty. What obligations the United States owes to countries other than Japan is a complex question of international law. The reason why the United States is not immediately implementing its plan may be this.</p>
<p>The changes in the military situation caused by the construction of a base in Alaska are very obvious. Since the Washington Treaty, the United States has adopted a policy of non-interference in the Far East. After the limitation of naval power and the restriction of bases, neither the US nor Japan could be certain of victory in an attack on each other. If the plan to build a base in Alaska can be realized, Japan will be threatened by the US air and naval forces at any time. With Japan's current naval power, it has more than enough to dominate the Chinese seas, but it feels weak in dealing with the northern and eastern Pacific. Moreover, if Japan and Russia are about to engage in conflict in Siberia, the United States will set up military facilities at the eastern end of Siberia, both to increase Japan's worries and to encourage Russia's eastward advance. The meaning of this is extraordinary. In recent days, there have been widespread reports that the Soviet Union will open the Arctic sea route, from Leningrad to the Bering Strait. The subtle relationship between them is thought-provoking.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota met with "Pseudo-Minister" Ding Shiyuan yesterday and informed him that he had submitted a compromise proposal regarding the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway to the Russian Ambassador to Tokyo. As a result of consultations, the Foreign Ministry spokesman now believes that this proposal may be accepted by the Soviet Union because its contents are very generous. In any case, the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations have now reached the final stage. There must be one of two outcomes: either a peaceful resolution or the breakdown of the conference. Japan and "Manchukuo" are now awaiting a reply telegram from Moscow to determine the final solution. (Dispatch of the 25th, Reuters)</p>

The commercial relationship between France and Siam is not very important, and there is no conflict between French manufactured goods imported into Siam and Japanese goods. Political observers believe that this is the reason why France and Japan can be friendly. Recently, the Siamese Consul-General in Singapore was downgraded to Consul, while the Japanese side was promoted to Consul-General. Agile British politicians immediately invited the King and Queen of Siam to visit Britain as a counterbalance. London newspapers reported that what Siam needs is a larger navy to defend against Japanese attacks. The purpose of the Siamese King's visit to Britain this time is to negotiate this matter. However, political observers believe that Siam does not need to fear Japanese aggression, because Britain and France both want to guarantee Siam's independence as a buffer between their territories.

<p>Fairbanks Ten Martin bombers of the Army squadron flight landed here today, having completed half of the round trip flight between Washington and Fairbanks. The Army flying squadron took off from the Bolling Field in Washington, D.C. on Thursday morning, a journey of about 4,000 miles. The speed of the flight was unexpected. It has not yet been announced when they will depart to fly back. The purpose of this flight is obviously to give the pilots long-distance flight training, and to practice photography in Alaska, while testing the power of the Martin bombers, which were once praised as the most powerful aircraft in the world.

<p>Philadelphia Former Air Force Chief General Mitchell said in a speech at the Air Defense Joint Conference that the United States is currently threatened by the Japanese air force. Many Japanese aircraft have great speed and can fly long distances. They can fly from Japan to Alaska or the Pacific coast of the United States, drop bombs, and then return to Japan without landing or refueling in the middle. Mitchell also said that the air forces of various countries are developing rapidly, but the United States is stagnant. (Havas Telegram of the 24th)</p>

<p>London Air Defense Exercise Results in Victory for the Attacking Force</p>
<h3 id="e37">Dropped Bombs in Twenty-Nine Places <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(London) After the British Air Force conducted exercises over London last night, an official from the Ministry of Aviation said today that the attacking force was quite successful.</p>
<p>Three squadrons of bombers, a total of 36 aircraft, attacked the Ministry of Aviation within half an hour after the start of the mock battle, reaching their destination without obstruction. In theory, the attacking force dropped bombs on the Ministry of Aviation from a height of 6,000 feet, and the military supply depot in Kidbrooke was also bombed without resistance. The attacking force made a total of thirty-nine attacks last night, of which thirty-three were indeed blocked, but the attacking force's bombs hit twenty-nine places. (Reuters Telegram of the 24th)</p>
<p>(London) British air defense exercises continued last night, but due to heavy fog, the Ministry of Aviation prohibited all aircraft responsible for defending the capital from departing, in order to avoid unclear visibility and mutual collisions causing accidents. As a result of the exercise, all the targets attacked by the "enemy" aircraft were reached, but the Ministry of Aviation pointed out that the destroyer squadrons responsible for defense did not come out due to the fog, so the attacking aircraft were able to achieve their goals. If a real war were to occur, it would never be like this, so the results of the exercise cannot be considered conclusive. Some people do not regard this exercise as serious.

<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry spokesman participated in a press conference held here today, saying that Britain, the United States, and Japan have all agreed not to raise political issues in the future naval conference, especially those concerning East Asia. This decision can be called wise, because if political issues are raised, the conference will fail. (Reuters Telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>(London) According to news from the Japanese side, Britain, Japan, and the United States have agreed not to discuss political issues at the 1935 naval conference. Political figures here are commenting on this news. According to people closely associated with the government, if political issues are excluded from the naval conference, negotiations are unlikely to succeed. In short, no formal agreement has yet been reached on this point. People here believe that it is best not to involve the political situation of various issues on the agenda of the naval conference. This is in line with what Foreign Minister Simon said in the House of Commons a few days ago, but it is very difficult to avoid certain key points, such as the status of the powers in China and the Singapore naval base, in the naval conference.

<p>(Tokyo) The legal effect of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will take place next March. The Japanese government believes that withdrawal from the League of Nations, whether from a legal or international customary law perspective, has nothing to do with the ownership of the mandated islands. However, it only complies with Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, and is obligated to submit an administrative report annually. Last year's annual report was sent to Yokoyama, the Japanese Consul-General in Geneva, yesterday. Furthermore, regarding rumors that Japan is preparing for a Pacific war and has military facilities in the mandated territories, the Japanese government reports the following in accordance with Article 13 of the League of Nations Covenant's military provisions: After the establishment of the South Seas Agency, all temporary naval defenses were withdrawn. Recently, there are no naval deployments or military base facilities on [the] island. There are no military facilities for the islanders either. The maintenance of security in these twelve districts is carried out by the police. (Telegraphic Dispatch of the 25th)</p>

<p>Vienna - Today at noon, the broadcasting station announced that the Dollfuss government had resigned and transferred power to Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Lintner. The entire capital was thrown into an uproar. This claim could not be verified. However, it was later heard that there was gunfire from the windows of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation headquarters. It became clear that there was a reason for the earlier broadcast. The Annagasse building where the broadcasting station was located, and the surrounding streets, were guarded by police carrying rifles. Machine guns were hastily set up opposite the broadcasting station and the Burgtheater. Subsequently, a large detachment of regular army and home guard opened fire on the broadcasting station. The station also returned fire, causing many casualties on both sides. Although a large police force tried to get the public to leave the dangerous area, thousands of people ran to the streets to watch the battle. The government's resignation claim was later formally denied by the authorities.</p>
<p>This afternoon, the police authorities announced a state of high alert. Many people did not believe the broadcasting station's announcement of the government's resignation, thinking it was a prank by members of the National Socialist Party. Upon hearing this news, leaders of the Home Guard and the Army knew something was amiss and quickly mobilized the entire army to surround the station, deploying a tight security cordon to isolate the inner city from the rest of the capital. It was reported that National Socialist terrorists had invaded the broadcasting station. Although they broadcast the false report of the Austrian government's resignation, the station supervisor quickly cut off the power. The remaining staff rushed into the station and captured the invading thugs. Currently, all is peaceful in Vienna. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<p>(Paris) - The political crisis is expected to subside due to the intervention of Prime Minister Doumergue. The cabinet will remain in office without changes. This morning, the President separately met with the Radical Party cabinet members and sincerely advised them to prioritize national affairs and not to start party disputes, otherwise the political truce will end. Subsequently, the cabinet held a meeting for two hours and announced that Taittinger's criticism of Chautemps was a personal matter and not an official matter, and declared that the cabinet still maintained that the Committee investigating the Stavisky financial scandal never raised any questions about Chautemps' honor.

<p>(Paris) - The cabinet meeting opened at 5:00 PM to discuss the important issue of the internal conflict between the left and right factions within the cabinet. It ended at 7:00 PM. All cabinet members debated fiercely, but all took national interests as the premise. Prime Minister Doumergue issued a declaration asking them to maintain a spirit of unity. Ministers Herriot and Sarraut first presented the views of the Radical Party. Herriot then expressed his support for Prime Minister Doumergue's proposal to his colleagues. Doumergue's declaration contained many criticisms of Minister Taittinger, and his attitude was extremely moving. Therefore, it was decided to withdraw the Radical Party's request for Taittinger to leave the cabinet and not to discuss it. After the cabinet meeting adjourned, Minister Sarraut recited the declaration issued by Prime Minister Doumergue at the cabinet meeting, which stated that Taittinger's self-defense at the Stavisky fraud investigation committee of the National Assembly was sincere, but this action did not comply with the original restraints of the parties and endangered the existence of the cabinet. But in the current situation, if Taittinger's position in the cabinet is maintained, the Radical Party will not support the cabinet, and the party truce will inevitably be broken. Conversely, if the Prime Minister requests Taittinger to resign, or accepts Taittinger's resignation, the party truce will still be broken, and the Prime Minister himself will be responsible for the breach. Because there are only two ways out at present, either to maintain the status quo or for the entire cabinet to resign. If the cabinet resigns, the Prime Minister himself will no longer be the Prime Minister in the new cabinet. Therefore, Doumergue appealed to all cabinet members to be patriotic and make France secure. Sarraut said that the Prime Minister's appeal has been understood by all parties, so the cabinet will continue to maintain its original state. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>(Paris) - After the cabinet meeting adjourned, Radical Party leader Minister Herriot declared that the Radical Party cabinet members would retain their original positions and would not resign, but this incident would be discussed at the Radical Party Congress in October. Also, the presidium of the executive committee of the Radical Socialist Party and the parliamentary group passed a resolution after listening to the explanation of the Radical Party cabinet members, stating that "the presidium of the executive committee of the Radical Socialist Party and the parliamentary group have placed on record the reprimand of Minister Taittinger by Prime Minister Doumergue and endorse the declaration issued by the Radical Party cabinet members after the cabinet meeting." This resolution was released at 11:00 PM, and its wording did not facilitate the existence of the truce cabinet. It can be seen that the current cabinet crisis was saved by Prime Minister Doumergue's sincere advice and his personal prestige, but the anger of the Radical Party has not yet subsided.

It was transported by Imperial Airways staff and supervised by Egyptian customs officials. At 2:00 AM this morning, two hours before the plane's departure, an Imperial Airways employee found that the gold bar was missing and immediately reported it to the police station. The police station said that the gold bar had been transported to the seaplane and there was no evidence. However, the Imperial Airways management insisted that it had been transported to the plane, but no signed certificate had been obtained. The police station has now detained two suspected employees of the company, one American and one Egyptian, because they were on the plane at a relevant time. Both insisted on their innocence and blamed each other. The police are now searching everywhere and dredging the river around where the plane was parked, but the gold has not been found.

<h3 id="e74">Measures for Tax Exemption on Sunken or Lost Salt <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance instructed all salt administration agencies and auditing offices that the practice of tax-free replacement shipments for salt permits lost or damaged due to negligence in various districts is now abolished, and orders to comply have been issued. Repeatedly, merchants from various districts have presented petitions expressing difficulties and appealing for modifications. It is now determined that since the cancellation of replacement shipments for sunken or lost salt has been clearly ordered, there is no reason to suspend its implementation. Regarding merchants transporting salt from production areas to sales locations, they should be instructed to ensure that taxes and fees in the sales districts are covered by insurance, and this should be strictly enforced to fundamentally resolve the issue. However, before the insurance measures are properly planned and implemented, to show consideration for merchants, the following temporary regulations are established: henceforth, all cases of lost or sunken salt permits in various districts, regardless of transport by sail or steam, and whether coarse or refined sea salt, and regardless of the cause of the accident, shall not be granted tax-free replacement shipments, and the field taxes already paid shall not be refunded. Those who have not paid the field taxes or have not paid in full shall be ordered to compensate or make up the difference. However, if the loss is indeed due to a disaster and is reported to the responsible salt administration agency for verification and is not fabricated, then after reporting for verification, the unpaid onshore taxes for the actual amount of salt lost shall be exempted, and the guarantee deposits for pre-paid taxes and salt passing through high-tax areas shall also be refunded according to the actual amount of salt lost. If broken or old ships are used, or salt ships not registered with the salt administration agency are used, or if navigation is negligent or measures are inadequate, resulting in sinking, the onshore taxes shall still be compensated and shall not be exempted. Furthermore, in cases of loss or sinking, the date of reporting must not be more than three days from the date of the accident, and the date of investigation must not be more than three days from the date of reporting, and the date of the investigation report must not be more than five days. If a ship owner fabricates a report of loss or sinking, in addition to ordering the payment of the reported amount of lost salt at the delivered sales price, the ship owner shall be permanently dismissed and prohibited from transporting taxed salt. If a merchant fabricates a report of loss or sinking, it is often the ticket merchant transporting the salt themselves, and the salt ticket shall be cancelled. If the ticket is leased for transport, a fine shall be levied according to the ticket period to serve as a warning. Regarding cases of loss or sinking permits that have already been reported but not approved, and cases of tax-free shipment permits that have already been approved for shipment, since the cancellation has been clearly ordered, there is no need for further discussion. However, to ensure equal treatment, all previous cases where deposits were made shall be exempted from onshore taxes if they were indeed losses due to sinking, to demonstrate fairness. The measures for instructing merchants to obtain insurance shall be properly planned and submitted for approval. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Anglo-American Consultation, British-Japanese Mediation, Multilateral Negotiation, Five-Power Opposition</p>
<p>The future of the 1935 Naval Conference is fraught with obstacles, and these obstacles are not easy to eliminate. This is well known to people in Britain and the United States. Therefore, Britain proposed convening a preparatory conference, with Britain and the United States beginning talks in London. At the same time, Japan was invited to join in trilateral consultations, and France and Italy were also invited to participate in multilateral discussions. The Anglo-American talks were held on June 18th at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street. The British side was represented by Prime Minister MacDonald, Naval Minister Monsell, Vice Admiral Riddell, and Kellogg, Director of the American Department of the Foreign Office. The American side included Davis, representative to the Disarmament Conference, Bingham, the ambassador to Britain, Rear Admiral Leigh, the counselor to the embassy. They first exchanged views and issued a simple statement opposing Japan's claim to abolish naval ratios and establish equal rights to national defense. Secondly, they also discussed the location of the 1935 Naval Conference, considering London, Paris, or Brussels, but no consensus was reached. That afternoon, Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira Tsuneo visited British Prime Minister MacDonald at the House of Commons, inquiring about the progress of the Anglo-American consultations and explaining Japan's views. On the 19th, American representative Davis visited the Japanese ambassador to Britain at his residence, explaining the American position and inquiring about Japan's views on naval disarmament. France and Italy have not yet been formally notified. This conference is not very important on the surface, and it does not require immediate conclusions, but the content is still very complex, and there are still many difficulties ahead. For example, whether the understanding between Britain and the United States, the reconciliation between the United States and Japan, and the mediation between France and Italy can be satisfactory, or even whether a temporary peace can be achieved, is questionable. Because naval disarmament at least includes two aspects, one is political issues, and the other is the technical aspects of armaments. If political issues are not adequately resolved, the technical aspects will always be unclear. For example, the biggest outstanding issue in the Pacific Ocean in political terms is the mandate of the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands. According to the interpretation of international law, since Japan has notified its withdrawal from the League of Nations, if it does not declare its return to the League next year, the mandate should be returned to the League of Nations. However, Japan not only does not indicate that it will return them, but it also builds air force markers, naval bases, and installs various military defenses on those islands, which has caused unease in the United States and attention in Britain. Therefore, technical consultations on naval disarmament will not be easy to reconcile. Moreover, after Japan occupied Manchuria, it had a strong tendency to move south actively, so Britain and the United States are particularly uneasy, and naval reduction is even more difficult. Japan proposed that the preparatory conference should not discuss political issues (leaving aside Manchuria and the three islands north of the equator held under mandate), otherwise Japan would not participate in the conference. The United States is very unhappy with this, while Britain acknowledges it. Therefore, the current talks do not discuss political relations, but focus solely on naval technology.</p>
<p>Even with naval technology, Britain and the United States cannot agree. Britain's coastline is about 70,000 miles or more, and she has colonies all over the world. With colonies come naval ports. It is easy for the British Navy to take on coal, oil, and water. In fact, she does not need giant ships and guns to protect her maritime security and maintain her commercial traffic. However, Britain has a big drawback: it cannot be self-sufficient in food and must rely on overseas supplies, and all her merchant fleets can easily be converted into powerful cruisers. Therefore, she only needs a large number of light cruisers. Britain currently has 50 cruisers, and in two years, 10 will be retired due to old age. Britain plans to build 30 new cruisers, for a total target of 70 new ships. The United States believes that this number is too large and is very detrimental to the future of disarmament. However, the United States must maintain communication between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the security of the Panama Canal, and the effectiveness of the Monroe Doctrine, and therefore must strongly advocate the principle of giant ships and guns, but it cannot openly promote military expansion, so it came up with a way to temporarily maintain the status quo, that is, to extend the Washington and London naval treaties, with battleships and auxiliary ships all in accordance with the previous agreements. This is the difference in opinion between Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>As for Japan, it fundamentally advocates the abolition of the ratio system, claiming that there are new threats from the Vladivostok area and that it wants to maintain peace in the Far East. Britain and the United States agree that this should not be interpreted in this way. The positions established by the three countries are irreconcilable. Moreover, Italy has decided to build two 35,000-ton warships. France believes that Italy's coastline is very short, so why are such huge warships necessary? France and Italy have always been opposed to each other in the Mediterranean, vying for hegemony in North Africa. Now this new problem has arisen, and it will be difficult to resolve at the naval disarmament conference. Britain wants to maintain communication through the Strait of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal, and it cannot help but feel the serious pressure from Italy's expansion of its navy. With such different positions, various divergent claims arise, so how can compromise be sought in the preparatory conference? (June 20th, London)</p>

<h3 id="e91">Japanese and Chinese Representatives Meet in Dalian to Discuss Unresolved Issues in War Zones <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Japan Plans to Expand the Organization of the South Manchuria Railway Office in Beiping</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Hu Yintong of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway Bureau telegraphed a certain political organ in Beiping today, reporting that after arriving in Dalian, he and the Japanese Kwantung Army representatives, Deputy Chief of Staff Okamura Yasuji, Colonel Kita Seiichi, and Japanese Embassy military attaché Shibayama, began discussing war zone issues on the evening of the 23rd, and they proposed studying the North China issue, only making preliminary exchanges of views, and that formal discussions will still require considerable negotiation. According to another source, Okamura and others intend to resolve issues such as joint transportation and postal services incidentally. Yin will discuss with the Japanese side based on the response policy agreed upon with Chairman Huang Fu at Mogan Mountain.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Request to Restore Joint Transportation <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the war zone issue, Japanese Embassy military attaché Shibayama Kenjiro went to Dalian after agreeing on a solution with the Kwantung Army authorities in Changchun, and has now met with Hu Yintong, Director of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway Bureau, to discuss it. Now Yin has a telegram to Beiping, to the person in charge of a certain political affairs agency, reporting that he arrived in Dalian the night before last on the Dalian Maru from Qingdao and immediately met with Shibayama to make preliminary exchanges of views on various unresolved issues in the war zone. If there are further results, he will telegraph Huang (Fu) and report, and then send additional representatives to Dalian to participate in the discussions. After the Beiping-Shenyang train service was implemented, the Japanese side constantly demanded the restoration of joint Sino-Japanese railway transportation. Our authorities, because of the urgent pressure from the Japanese side, and taking advantage of the Railway Minister Gu Mengyu's northern trip to avoid the summer heat, closely contacted everything. After Gu arrived at Xishan, he did not see guests. Regarding the joint transportation issue, he will leave one aide in Beiping to deal with everything. The Japanese side also plans to send Sotogawa, an advisor to the South Manchuria Railway, to Beiping to meet with Gu. However, after this news spread, all parties paid close attention. It is heard that Sotogawa has decided not to come to Beiping for the time being. This issue will still be handled by the Oriental Travel Service, which is responsible for the Beiping-Shenyang train service.</p>

<p>The reporter interviewed Yin Rugeng, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Ji-Mi District, and he said the following: (1) Director Yin (Tong) was ordered to go to Dalian from Shanghai to meet with Shibayama. The content of the discussions is unknown because Yin went directly. I did not receive an order from Chairman Huang to participate. (2) The date of the war zone security team taking over and the handover of the Eastern Mausoleums can be decided after Shibayama returns to Beiping. (3) To organize transportation in the war zone, the Beijing-Shenyang Railway Bureau recently sent engineer Sun Yiqian to Beiping to contact me. The organization plan has been drafted, and Sun is scheduled to return to Nanjing this afternoon for assessment and then send several survey teams to measure and implement the organization.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Japan Plots Economic Invasion <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>After the implementation of the Beiping-Shenyang train service, the South Manchuria Railway Company of Japan immediately wanted to request from our side to start "Economic Cooperation in North China" in order to achieve its ambition of economic invasion. In order to promote Sino-Japanese "Economic Cooperation," the Japanese side plans to expand the organization of the South Manchuria Railway Office in Beiping. At the same time, the president of the South Manchuria Railway has tentatively appointed Sotogawa, a former director of the South Manchuria Railway, as an advisor, giving him full authority to represent the Japanese side in handling matters related to "Economic Cooperation." It is heard that Sotogawa has had two earnest talks with influential people in the North China administrative department. The Japanese plan to invest solely in economic development. The commercial department of the South Manchuria Railway Company will also move a portion to Beiping. According to reliable information from embassy circles, the Japanese side has been preparing since the implementation of the train service to promote a united Far East economic cooperation (24th).</p>
<h3 id="e95">Wang and Li Visit Huang at Mogan Mountain in Succession <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Wang Keming Was Summoned to Discuss North China Finances, Li Discussed, Huang is scheduled to Return North in Early July</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Wang Keming, Chief Counselor and Director of the Finance Department of the Executive Yuan's Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, was summoned by Chairman Huang Fu via telegram and went south from Beiping to Mogan Mountain to meet with Huang to discuss North China finances. It is now known that Wang has once again gone to Mogan Mountain from Shanghai to meet with Huang. He passed through Hangzhou at 5 pm on the 24th and took the overnight express train to Shanghai. When the reporter visited him and inquired about his meeting with Huang and North China finances, he said that Chairman Huang (Fu) had been away from Beiping for three months, and government affairs were awaiting handling. He was specially summoned to come south to discuss everything. The monthly military expenses in North China are 4.5 million, and the monthly military expenses of the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee are 80,000, all of which are directly distributed by the central government. There are no difficulties at present. After the war zone is recovered, the local finances will be organized by officials sent by the Hebei Provincial Government. Regarding the establishment of checkpoints at the Great Wall, the Ministry of Finance has sent Zhang Yongnian to actively prepare. The war zone special police were formerly bandits reorganized and numbered 2,000. Now they have been reduced to 1,000, so it is planned to transfer them out for training. The Japanese ruffians in the war zone are rampant. Although the Japanese consulate is suppressing them, there are too many to handle. I will stay in Shanghai for three to five days before returning north. Although Wang is from Hangzhou, his movements here were very secretive, and most relatives and friends did not know about it. Only Shou Yicheng and Sun Ji Yuan, the vice presidents of the Bank of China in Hangzhou, and others saw him off at the station.</p>
<p>Also, Li Zeyi, a member of the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee and special envoy of the Fujian Province for foreign affairs, came to Hangzhou from Shanghai at 12:30 am on the 24th. Without stopping, he took a car to Mogan Mountain to meet with Huang Fu to discuss North China foreign affairs issues. He stayed overnight at the Caigenxiang Hotel and went down the mountain at 5 am this morning (25th), taking a car through Hangzhou and catching the 8:15 am early express train to Shanghai. After many efforts, the reporter managed to meet with Li and inquired about the foreign situation in South China and the situation in North China. According to him, after the turmoil in Fujian Province last year, the local area is now peaceful and there are no foreign affairs incidents. The conference of Japanese consuls in South China convened by the Taiwan Governor-General's Office is a routine annual meeting of the Japanese side. Whether it has any ulterior motives is unknown. Chairman Huang is at Mogan Mountain, still meticulously planning the overall situation in North China, and is constantly instructing Beiping via telegram. There is no negative intent. He will be able to go north in early July to preside over the overall situation in North China and supervise the handling of various outstanding matters. Yin Tong arrived in Dalian to negotiate with the Kwantung Army, and the results have not been telegraphed. The saying that Yin went to Changchun is because Okamura had already arrived, so there was no need to go. I will stay in Shanghai for a day or two, waiting for a ship to return to Fujian to handle the completion, and then return to Shanghai to follow Huang north, etc. (25th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Japanese Establish Farms in Northern Rehe <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Vast Farmland of Over 380,000 Mu</p>
<p>Implement Armed Immigration and Encourage Poppy Cultivation</p>
<p>Build Roads on the Border of Rehe and Chahar to Invade Inner Mongolia</p>
<p>Chengde Correspondence: The Japanese East Asia Development Company has recently opened up a vast farm of over 380,000 mu in the Dongmeng area northwest of Kailu County, Rehe Province. Since the September 18th Incident, the area has been sparsely populated, and farmers have abandoned their fields and scattered. The company has now sent engineers Sato and Goto, a false councilor of the false Xing'an Branch Office, and Terada, a false councilor of Kailu County, to organize a team of 80 horse-drawn carriages to survey the area and then implement large-scale armed immigration. They usually specialize in growing poppies and secondarily grow licorice and sesame to reap huge profits. In times of tension, they will use them as the vanguard of invasion. Also, regarding other fertile areas of Rehe Province, which have always been grain-producing areas, the Japanese have recently been actively promoting a policy of planting tobacco. The Japanese designate a certain household's land to plant a certain number of mu of opium, and the farmer must comply. Sales are made externally, and taxes are specially reduced. If the acreage of tobacco planted exceeds last year, there are still rewards. Therefore, many farmers are tempted by profit. The Japanese have also established loan offices in important places in Rehe Province, forcibly lending money to local residents in varying amounts, often thousands of yuan, using house and land deeds as collateral, with monthly interest rates as high as three or four cents. Payments are made monthly, and if there is a slight delay, they are arrested and imprisoned. If they refuse to borrow money, the Japanese regard them as wealthy assets and will inevitably suffer unexpected assassinations. After Duolun was occupied by the Japanese army, they actively built roads to facilitate military transportation as a preliminary plan to invade Inner Mongolia. Chengde to Guyuan is an important military base. Previously, when building roads, the false county magistrates of various counties forcibly conscripted laborers. Several township heads in a certain area were buried alive headfirst in the soil pits by the Japanese for failing to do their jobs well. The situation was extremely tragic. Residents on the border of Rehe and Chahar are under the tyrannical oppression of the Japanese army and all hate them intensely. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Japanese Opium King Goes to Manchuria to Guide Poppy Cultivation <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Boasting Great Expertise in Planting Methods</p>
<p>Unexpected Results Can Be Achieved After Guidance</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on the 21st, Mr. Nihanaga Otozo, from Fukui Village, Mishima County, Osaka Prefecture, was recently recruited by the An'an County Opium Monopoly Wholesale Office in Fengtian Province, Manchuria, to guide the cultivation methods. Nihanaga departed for Manchuria on the 21st. The designated cultivation areas in Manchuria include 18 counties in the eastern part of Jilin Province, the entire Rehe Province, the western part of Xing'an Province, and areas within Fengtian Province such as Changbai, Linjiang, Antu, and Fusong, totaling 65,000 hectares. The future harvest can yield one million catties of raw opium. Because opium cultivation is most advanced in our country (referring to Japan), and Mr. Nihanaga is known as the King of Opium, unexpected results can be achieved with his actual guidance. According to Mr. Nihanaga's statement to Japanese reporters, India, Persia, and Turkey are the most famous opium-producing areas in the world, exporting large quantities overseas each year. China still cultivates freely, but the cultivation methods are not as refined as in Japan. I have put a lot of effort into cultivation methods. This time, I will contribute my cultivation experience to Manchuria. It is planned to implement it first in the jurisdiction of the An'an Wholesale Office within a month, and then spread it to other designated areas. Although I am already 60 years old, I am very excited about my energy and health.</p>

<p>丨The Second Phase of the Military Officer Training Corps is About to Commence丨</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Since arriving at Lushan on the 8th from Nanjing, Chairman Chiang has resided at Haihui Temple, personally overseeing the Army Officer Training Corps. He delivers exhortations at the flag-raising and lowering ceremonies every day, emphasizing rigorous training. He views this as a means to reform the national army's cadres and instill new knowledge and spirit into all soldiers. The first phase is nearing completion, and officers above the rank of battalion commander from provinces such as Shanxi, Hebei, Hunan, and Fujian, including Li Shengda and others, have gathered at Lushan, awaiting assignment and enlistment. Chiang is using this spare time to meet with representatives from Nanjing regarding important matters, as well as military and political personnel seeking instructions from various quarters. Zhang Xueliang, He Chengjun, and others have successively visited Chiang at his private residence to report on the suppression of Xu Ke and He Yao’s bandits in Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Sichuan, and to request instructions on post-suppression measures for remnant bandits in the border regions of various provinces, as well as the implementation of the New Life Movement. Furthermore, Duan Qirui recently arrived at Lushan to escape the summer heat. Chiang has shown him great respect, arranging accommodations for him and hosting a banquet on the 22nd, with Zhang Xueliang and others as guests, creating a very pleasant atmosphere. Zhang, He, and others, due to urgent military matters, returned to Wuhan on the 23rd, while Duan plans to stay at Lushan for an extended period. Chiang, anticipating the commencement of the second phase of officer training, is scheduled to return to Haihui Temple on the 23rd or 24th to deliver exhortations and personally supervise all aspects. He will only return to Nanchang after the autumn cools down. Because Lushan has telephone access to Nanchang, which can be routed to the Northern Headquarters in Nancheng and Nanfeng, command is very convenient. (July 23rd)</p>

<p>Three Days of Wind and Rain Result in Significant Losses; Several Feet of Water Flood Zhangzhou City</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The recent South China Sea hurricane that struck Taiwan and the coastal areas of Fujian, followed by torrential rains, caused Xiamen to experience rain starting on the morning of the 20th. By the 21st, the wind and rain intensified, the day was overcast, and the temperature plummeted from 88 degrees on the 20th to 78 degrees on the 21st, bringing a cool, early autumn-like feel, prompting people to wear lined clothing. On the 22nd, the wind subsided but rain persisted, remaining overcast until the morning of the 23rd, when it finally cleared and the temperature rose to 80 degrees. Taiwan was the hardest hit by the disaster. According to reports from Taiwan, the entire island was enveloped by hurricanes and torrential rains starting on the afternoon of the 19th, with the southern region experiencing the most intense conditions. Various locations were battered by strong winds, causing widespread panic. The island suffered significant losses. The storms lasted three days and two nights, gradually subsiding by the afternoon of the 21st. As of 10:00 AM on the 22nd, preliminary investigations revealed that Tainan Prefecture was the most severely affected, particularly the Beimen, Xinying, and Zengwen districts. Two men died, three people are missing, 111 heads of livestock died, 99 heads were lost, 101 houses were completely destroyed, 71 were half-destroyed, 161 were severely damaged, 264 were slightly damaged, 1,823 households had water reaching the level of the beds, and 11,859 households had water below the level of the beds. 139 non-residential houses were completely destroyed, and 68 were half-destroyed. Furthermore, in the Beigang district, train services were disrupted due to flooding, and 560 houses were flooded. Below Kaohsiung, transportation and communication facilities were damaged by the wind and rain. Although some services had been restored by the 22nd, the situation remains unclear due to incomplete restoration. The extent of the disaster is expected to be severe, with losses amounting to several tens of thousands of yuan. The Gangshan district was the most severely affected, with over 900 households flooded to a depth of six feet. 6,000 residents were forced to seek refuge on second floors or rooftops, enduring the wind and rain in a state of panic for three days and two nights. Relief efforts began on the 21st after the rain stopped, with aid groups providing food to sustain life. Pingtung also sustained considerable damage, with 53 houses flooded. The Jiali district was particularly hard hit, with 150,000 catties of longan pulp and 8,100 tons of bananas damaged. Crop losses in the Taichung Prefecture are also anticipated, with damage estimated to reach tens of thousands of yuan, and 14 houses collapsed. The north-south trunk railway between Zhutian and Gangshan in Taiwan was disrupted due to flooding caused by torrential rains, and service was only restored at 6:30 PM on the 21st. The severity of the disaster in Taiwan is evident.</p>
<p>In Xiamen, due to the hurricane passing through Zhangzhou on the 21st, coastal vessels from Quanzhou turned back, and services were suspended on the 21st and 22nd, only resuming on the 23rd. Only one merchant ship, the Fuzhou, entered the port on the 21st. A Shanghai-bound ship was delayed for three days due to the hurricane and had not arrived as of the evening of the 22nd. A Hong Kong-bound ship entered the port on the 22nd. Inland roads were damaged by the rain, and all Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen buses were suspended on the 22nd. In Zhangzhou, located downstream of the Jiulong River, and Nanjin, both of which are low-lying areas, heavy rain continued from the afternoon of the 20th to the morning of the 22nd. By the morning of the 22nd, the water level in the river had risen significantly and flooded into the city, including Yanglaozhou and the east and west Malu roads of Xingmin, reaching the height of people's bodies. By 4:00 PM, the river level had risen further, surging into the Minguo Bank on Dingwei South Road, the vicinity of the Yongjing Middle Road to the Taiqingquan Hotel, and the Taigu Bridge, flooding them by several feet. The Xiazaixiang Jiang Normal School for Women and the Shipu community were also flooded, forcing residents to evacuate to upper floors. Many houses and shops placed barriers in front of their doors to block the water, but these were largely ineffective. All roads in Zhangzhou Prefecture remained closed from the 21st to the 22nd due to the flooding. The prices of rice and firewood increased as a result. The price of rice rose from 85 cents per dou to 90 cents per dou, and the price of firewood rose from 47-48 bundles per yuan to 40 bundles per yuan. However, as of the morning of the 23rd, there had been no reports of collapsed houses, and losses were relatively small. Transportation in the surrounding countryside has been disrupted, and the situation remains unclear. (July 23rd)</p>

<p>It is Discovered by Feng Yuxiang's Subordinates that Fake Brigade Commander Zhang Huchen is on the Run</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Recently, disgruntled military personnel have been plotting mischief and organizing fake military organizations in Shandong. The central organization is located in Jinan, falsely claiming to be the Yimin Company, and has appointed several division and brigade commanders to recruit in various counties. A few days ago, Liu Yaoting of the Third Route Army Headquarters' special reconnaissance team discovered and cracked down on the organization in Jinan, capturing several individuals, including the fake First Army Commander, Shu Zhentang, and the First Brigade Commander, Yue Dai, as well as numerous reactionary lists and letters of appointment. The search for remaining members is ongoing. Zhang Huchen, Brigade Commander of the First Brigade of the First Division of the fake military organization, and others were active in the Tai'an area. Yesterday, they were discovered by Feng Yuxiang's subordinates stationed in Mount Tai. After reporting to Feng, Feng ordered his battalion commander, Wang Zhiyi, to work with the Tai'an County Government to crack down on the organization and nip the rebellion in the bud. However, Zhang Huchen had already left, and only one of his accomplices, Song Kunshan, was apprehended. He will be transported to Jinan in the coming days to be jointly tried. The telegram from Tai'an County Magistrate Zhou Baihong is recorded below:</p>
<p>"(Titles abbreviated) I have just received a report from Battalion Commander Wang Zhiyi, sent by Mr. Feng, stating that a fake military reactionary organization has been cracked down in Jinan, and that Brigade Commander Zhang Huchen and others are hiding in the western suburbs of Tai'an. He requested assistance in apprehending them. I immediately dispatched a police chief with officers to assist in the capture. However, Zhang Huchen had already left. We apprehended his accomplice, Zhu Kunshan, who confessed to his knowledge of the situation and admitted to recruiting for the fake army. I have ordered a strict search for Zhang Huchen to continue. I respectfully report this matter, Zhou Baihong, Yang Hai." (July 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e102">Bandits Discovered in Linyi, Shandong Province <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Bandits Near Nanyang Lake Are Also Active; Han Fuqu Has Dispatched Troops to Search and Suppress Them</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: After the clearing campaign in this province, large groups of bandits were largely eliminated. Recently, due to the growing crops, bandits in northern Jiangsu have become active again. According to a report from Liu Huating, Magistrate of Feng County, a group of 50 to 60 bandits from Picheng County, Jiangsu, suddenly crossed into Xujiafangzi, Qingping Township, on the border between Jiangsu's Picheng County and Shandong's Linyi County, on the night of the 21st. The County Magistrate has led local militias and village associations to block and suppress them. After receiving the report, Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu replied by telegram, ordering the County Magistrate to suppress the bandits swiftly and thoroughly, and ordered the Sixtieth Brigade stationed in Zaozhuang to assist.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the Jinxiang, Yutai, Jiaxiang, Nanyang Lake, and Wenshang areas of southern Shandong, bandit activity has been occurring recently due to the growing crops, disturbing the peace of the region. Residents of the area have jointly submitted a petition to the Provincial Government, requesting the dispatch of troops to search and suppress the bandits and ensure the safety of the people. After receiving the petition, Chairman Han ordered Liu Yaoting, Captain of the Special Reconnaissance Team, to lead a team to search and suppress the bandits and ensure local safety. Upon receiving the order, Liu led 55 officers and scouts, carrying 55 Mauser pistols and 10 rifles, departing at 4:40 PM today (the 23rd) on the No. 1 armored vehicle to search and suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Fourth Route Militia of this province, led by Xie Shuxian, was originally stationed in Qufu. Recently, it was transferred to Ju County by provincial order to facilitate bandit suppression yesterday (the 23rd).</p>
<h3 id="e103">Notorious Bandit Wang Yunlong Executed in Southern Fujian <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Has Terrorized the Huian Area for Over a Decade; Apprehended and Executed by a Detachment of the Governor's Headquarters</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Wang Yunlong, a notorious bandit in southern Fujian, was executed by firing squad in Zhangzhou on the 20th of this month. Wang, along with Wang Hanmin and his brother Wang Lianmin, were three major bandit leaders in Huian County for over a decade. Their scourge was not limited to Huian County, but extended to Huian, Jinjiang, Putian, and Xianyou. Wang Hanmin was killed in Putian in 1929 by Lin Shouguo, Brigade Commander of the Marine Corps. Wang Lianmin succeeded him as leader of the group, but fled to Shanghai after a defeat. People from Huian reported him to the Shanghai authorities, and he was arrested and executed by firing squad in Shanghai by the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters in 1932. Afterwards, Wang Yunlong commanded the remaining bandits, wreaking havoc in the Huian-Putian area. In 1929, he attacked and captured the Huian County seat, looting the entire city. In addition to these incidents, he engaged in kidnappings, robberies, arson, and murders. Northern Huian suffered the most. When the Central Army entered Fujian to quell the rebellion, Wang also raised the banner of the anti-rebellion people's army. His forces consisted of over 500 men, all armed with modern firearms, including machine guns. Subsequently, the Military Affairs Commission's headquarters issued an order to revoke the title of anti-rebellion people's army and ordered them to garrison in place, awaiting reorganization, and forbidding them from disturbing the people. Wang then entrenched himself in northern Huian, relying on his large number of men and superior weaponry to kidnap and extort in the northern and western Huian areas, engaging in all sorts of illegal activities and leaving Huian in a state of unrest. In March of this year, Song Xilian, commander of the Thirty-sixth Division, stationed troops in Quanzhou, and Li Liangrong, commander of the 216th Brigade, personally led a battalion of troops in five routes to suppress the bandits. Wang suffered a major defeat due to lack of preparation, with over 200 men killed and the rest scattered. Wang fled to Xiamen alone and hid in the house of a foreign national. At the end of April, he was arrested by the Fourth Detachment of the Nanchang Governor's Headquarters stationed in Xiamen. In May, he was taken to Longyan and then transferred to the Zhangzhou Headquarters in June. The Huian Chamber of Commerce, along with various community groups and villages, filed lawsuits against him. The Huian Fellow Villagers Association in Xiamen and the victims listed their grievances and filed lawsuits. The military court opened the trial, and all plaintiffs appeared in court to confront the defendant. After repeated trials, overseas Chinese from Huian also sent telegrams urging that he be brought to justice. The military court requested and obtained case files from the civil affairs department and the Huian County government, conducted a thorough investigation, and sentenced him to death. He was executed by firing squad in Zhangzhou on the morning of June 20th, and his crimes were announced as follows: "Announcement Regarding the Execution of Wang Yunlong, a Notorious Bandit in Southern Fujian, Also Known as Wang Gengmin: It has been determined that Wang Yunlong, also known as Wang Gengmin, previously colluded with his brother, the deceased bandit Wang Hanmin, and terrorized the Tianchuan area of Huian, engaging in widespread kidnapping, robbery, and devastation of nearly the entire county for over a decade, accumulating countless crimes. In June 1929, he attacked and captured the county seat, looting the entire city. In addition, he committed arson and murder. After Wang Hanmin was executed, Wang Yunlong opportunistically joined the anti-rebellion forces, but continued his criminal behavior, entrenching himself in the eastern, western, and northern townships of the county, causing multiple disturbances. Such heinous crimes are unforgivable. Wang has been apprehended and found guilty after a thorough investigation. He has been sentenced to death in accordance with the law. The aforementioned criminal Wang Yunlong, also known as Wang Gengmin, age 30, from Huian County, has been escorted to the execution ground at the foot of Zhishan Mountain today, verified to be the correct person, and executed by firing squad as a warning. This announcement is made, and it includes the execution by firing squad of bandit Wang Yunlong, also known as Wang Gengmin, age 30, from Huian County." (July 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Guangdong Province Abolishes Likin Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>To Be Implemented from August 1st, with Profits from Sugar Factories Used as Compensation</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: In recent years, the finances of Guangdong Province have been greatly improved through the streamlining of taxes and the introduction of taxes on imported foreign rice and agricultural products. More recently, the income from the sugar monopoly has further increased government revenue. Therefore, the financial authorities are implementing the plan to abolish the Likin taxes that should be eliminated and to abolish miscellaneous gambling levies in various counties. The losses from these taxes will be compensated for by the profits from the sugar monopoly. Starting next month, the Likin taxes that should be abolished include: the Guangzhou West Tax Office, the Guangzhou East Long Tax Office, the Gaozhou Prefecture Tax Office, the Leizhou Prefecture Tax Office, the Taiping Sanguan Tax Office, the Qiade Tax Office, the Chaozhou Prefecture Tax Office, the Qiongzhou Prefecture Tax Office, the Huangjiang Tax Office, the Foshan Fenshui Xinong Tax Office, the Hua County Luojiang Tax Office, the Yangchun Shanhe Ten Tax Office, the Wenchang Qinglan Yandun Land Tax, the Wenchang Puqian Tashi Land Tax, the Nanxiong Winter Mushroom Grass Mushroom Preserved Duck Levy, the Qiongya Betel Nut Export Levy, the Xijiang Lime Platform Likin, the Qiongya Maritime Defense Fee for the Entire Prefecture, and the Guangzhou Prefecture Tax Office, totaling 19 types. In addition, various miscellaneous gambling levies in 27 counties and cities within the province, such as Fogang, Hua County, Qingyuan, Zhaoqing, Heshan, Gaoming, Yunan, Deqing, Kaiping, Taishan, Jiangmen, Shunde, Shixing, Nanxiong, Yingde, Qujiang, Renhua, Lechang, Luyuan, Lianzhou, Lianshan, Yangshan, Pingyuan, Jiuling, Meixian, Xingning, and Wuhua, will also be abolished from August 1st. The total amount of advance payments made by the contractors for the aforementioned taxes and levies is 220,726 silver dollars, and the contractors for the miscellaneous gambling levies have deposited 277,400 silver dollars, totaling 498,126 silver dollars. These amounts should be refunded by the government. The Department of Finance has already submitted a request to the Provincial Government, which has been approved, to allocate funds from the profits of the sugar factories to refund the contractors in five monthly installments. If the aforementioned Likin taxes and miscellaneous gambling levies are abolished from August 1st, the total loss to the provincial treasury is estimated to be 295,794 silver dollars per month, and 3,549,530 silver dollars per year. The compensation method is to allocate funds from the profits of the sugar factories each month to make up for the loss in revenue, so as not to affect the provincial budget for the 23rd year. The aforementioned plan has already been submitted by the Department of Finance to the Provincial Government for review and approval, and the Provincial Government has issued orders to the Department of Finance and its subordinate departments to comply.

<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Since the 18th, the climate in various counties of southern Anhui has changed dramatically, with the average temperature between 84 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest temperature dropping to 78 degrees, a difference of 25 or 26 degrees compared to previous days. There have been several showers each day, but the long period of sunny weather without rain this summer has caused drought in various counties. The most severely affected counties include Shitai, Taiping, Ningguo, Jingde, Qingyang, Jiashan, Jingxian, and Dingyuan. The less severely affected counties include Huaining, Wangjiang, Susong, Guichi, Chuxian, Hefei, Nanling, Quanjiao, Tongcheng, Tianchang, Taihu, Hanshan, Tongling, Lujiang, Fanchang, Langxi, Hexian, Wuwei, Dangtu, Wuhu, and Guangde. Except for Xiuning, Huaiyuan, Shouxian, and Fuyang, which have not experienced drought, it is feared that most of the remaining 26 counties, such as Dongliu, Wuyuan, and Qimen, are also in a severe situation, according to provincial estimates. The Drought Relief Committee organized by the Provincial Construction Department has already carried out the following measures: (1) Ordering county governments to supervise irrigation day and night. (2) Providing detailed instructions on drought-resistant cultivation methods. (3) Conducting a detailed survey of the drought-affected area and crops suitable for the soil. (4) Selecting commonly applicable drought-resistant crop varieties and informing counties to prepare seeds. (5) Installing existing water-lifting machinery near Anqing and inquiring about the prices and types of machinery from manufacturing plants to prepare for procurement. (6) Surveying local grains and formulating follow-up measures to regulate food supplies for the people. (7) Issuing a general order to all counties to supervise and urge people to organize irrigation cooperatives. (8) Issuing a general order to all affiliated agricultural and forestry farms to send personnel to various locations to guide people in diverting water for irrigation and switching to drought-resistant crops. However, the rain has come too late, and the disaster has spread throughout the province. The entire rural economy is likely to be in an unrecoverable state. (July 23rd)</p>

<p>Amidst the cries of a prolonged drought, wool has suddenly grown from the cracks in the stone in the Didi Bridge area of Ganlu Xie, Yulin Township, Eighth Autonomous Region of this county. The wool growing from the cracks in the stone on the bridge surface is of various colors, including gray, yellow, and light green, while the wool under the bridge abutment is entirely white. Similar discoveries have also been made in villages near Xiqiao Bridge in Tangkou. It is said that this wool stands upright, root-up, before sunrise in the morning, but falls over after sunrise. The owner of a tea shop in the area has collected wool of various colors and is carefully preserving it for scientific research.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Continued Thunderstorms Reduce the Severity of the Disaster <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>A thunderstorm occurred in the county on the morning of the 24th at 4:00 AM and lasted until 5:30 AM. The average rainfall throughout the county was approximately three inches. The rice fields that have already been planted have standing water, which is expected to last for five to seven days without needing more water. The unplanted fields are only moistened with mud and do not have standing water. Farmers with seedlings are currently using water wheels to transplant the seedlings. Those without seedlings can only lament their fields, or transplant seedlings elsewhere. If the rain continues, the severity of the disaster can be reduced. Since the 24th, the water in the canal has been flowing from east to west, which is due to the higher rainfall in Suzhou compared to Wuxi. This is also a good sign.</p>

<p>Due to the lack of rain this summer, a drought was imminent. Many enthusiasts offered sacrifices to the Great White Dragon King to pray for rain for a month, but to no avail. Starting on the 17th of this month, there were occasional showers, especially on the nights of the 21st and 23rd, when the rainfall was the heaviest, totaling about one and a half feet. Consequently, those who had offered sacrifices to the Dragon King attributed the rainfall to its merit and initiated a race. The one at Kuatang Bridge in the city took the lead and held a race on the night of the 24th. The event included various carrying poles, children on horseback, and all kinds of ceremonial guards. The night lights were all made with electricity, shining brightly. As a result, the areas of Siqian Street in the city center, Nanshi Xin, and Xianxi Street were brightly lit with electric lights, creating a huge crowd and an extremely lively scene, which was a grand spectacle for a time, dispersing only at midnight.

<h3 id="e123">Supporting the Completion of the Ammonium Sulfate Factory <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Syndicate Provides Huge Low-Interest Loan</p>
<p>Total Loan Amount is 5.5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Shared and Borne by China and Five Other Banks</p>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, the ammonium sulfate factory is one of the five major basic industries planned to be established by the Ministry of Industry. It was originally planned to be operated with state funding, but due to various obstacles in funding and talent, it could not be realized. It was changed to be established by Fan Xudong, the manager of the Yongli Alkali Manufacturing Company in Tianjin, who raised funds. The fixed capital is 10.05 million yuan, and the Shanghai Syndicate, including China, Jincheng, and five other banks, will lend a low-interest loan of 5.5 million yuan to help it succeed. Now we will explore the details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e124">Establishing an Ammonium Sulfate Factory <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Ammonium sulfate is an indispensable raw material in industry. Whether it is military industry, chemical industry, manufacturing industry, or any other industry, it is a necessary product. Especially for agricultural countries, the large amount of fertilizer powder required is of the greatest importance to the national agricultural product yield. There are already more than 100 ammonium sulfate factories in the world, with the most in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the United States, and Japan. Imports to China are about 16 million yuan per year, which is also a huge loss. The Ministry of Industry planned to invest 15 million from the government to operate this factory, which is entirely state-owned. Later, due to difficulties in raising funds, it was changed to a joint venture between China and foreign countries. As a result, competition for investment from capitalists from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany was aroused, but it ended in failure due to overly harsh conditions. It was also planned to change it to a joint venture between officials and merchants, but there was still no way to obtain official shares. Finally, it was decided to establish it by Fan Xudong, who has achieved success in operating the Jiuda Crystal Salt Yongda Alkali Manufacturing Company. The Ministry of Industry will provide various conveniences to promote its success. Currently, more than 1,700 acres of factory land have been purchased near Xiejiadian on the riverside in Liuhe County, Pukou. Machines have been ordered from foreign countries, and specialized personnel have been recruited to actively prepare for the project. It is expected that the equipment can be completed within two years.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Total Amount of Equipment Capital <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Fan's plan is to spend a total of 10.05 million yuan on the equipment for the ammonium sulfate factory. The original capital of Yongli Alkali Manufacturing Company was 2 million yuan. Now, Yongli will be expanded and reorganized,</p>
<p>Adding 3 million yuan of share capital, totaling 5 million yuan, renamed "Yongli Chemical Industry Co., Ltd." The remaining 5.5 million yuan will be borrowed by Fan from China, Shanghai, Jincheng, Zhongnan, and Zhejiang Xingye banks. Currently, Zhang Gongquan, the general manager of China, and Wu Yunzhai, the manager of Jincheng, believe that the financial industry has no way out if industry is not developed. Therefore, after several consultations, their opinions have approached, establishing a low-interest, huge loan.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Establishment of Loan Content <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The total amount of the loan is 5.5 million yuan, with China and Shanghai each providing 1.5 million yuan, Jincheng and Zhongnan jointly providing 1.5 million yuan, and Zhejiang Xingye providing 1 million yuan. This loan has now been fully negotiated and established, and both parties have signed a contract. The content of the contract includes the following items: (1) The entire equipment of the ammonium sulfate factory is mortgaged; (2) Only interest is paid within two years, and the principal is not repaid; (3) Within two years, after the entire factory equipment is completed, 5.5 million yuan of company bonds will be issued, and these bonds will be used to repay the loan banks; (4) The syndicate has not allowed the interest rate to be announced, but according to a certain senior member of the syndicate, the interest rate of this loan is specially reduced to about 6-7% due to the relationship of supporting the development of basic industries. The factory has now ordered machinery from abroad, and the Pukou base is also under active construction. This loan will also be allocated successively as needed by the factory and can be freely withdrawn within the limit.</p>

<p>Because the Shareholders of the Factory Believe that There is a Way to Maintain It</p>
<p>Li Shengbo of the Cotton Control Committee Goes to Moganshan to Escape the Summer Heat</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Shenxin Fuxin Maoxin textile and flour factories operated by Rong Zongjing requested the government to find ways to maintain them due to business reasons. The Cotton Industry Control Committee, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance consulted on the reorganization plan and contacted the Shanghai banking community to borrow money for maintenance. Now that Rong Zongjing has been reinstated, he denies the reorganization. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the financial and competent authorities yesterday that the Cotton Control Committee and other agencies have drafted the establishment of a reorganization committee and the reorganization plan. Now, because the shareholders of Shenxin and other factories believe that there is a way to maintain them and reorganization is unnecessary, and Rong has also denied it, the case of reorganizing the factory has been shelved. Li Shengbo, the executive director of the Cotton Control Committee, has gone to Moganshan to escape the summer heat, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Shenxin and Other Factories Request Government Relief <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Impact of the Global Economic Recession, Rong Re-emerges to Shoulder Responsibility Due to the Rise of Rumors</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Shenxin Fuxin Maoxin textile and flour factories operated by Chinese industrialist Rong Zongjing, totaling twenty-one, are large in scope and are the only great industry in China. Recently, two sentences ago, Rong's factories were affected by the global economic recession, resulting in inflexible economic turnover and requested government relief. At the same time, Rong Zongjing declared his retirement due to old age and entrusted Wang Yuqing to act as general manager. However, in the past three or four days, Wang suddenly resigned, and Rong made a comeback. The twists and turns in this are extremely varied. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency visited Rong Zongjing at his head office at No. 421 Jiangxi Road yesterday in order to understand the truth behind this. It happened that Rong had already gone out, so I changed to see an important official of the company, who gave the following conversation:</p>
<p>The request for relief from Shenxin and other factories is entirely due to the impact of the entire global economic recession, so we request the government to provide economic assistance to facilitate turnover. This situation is not unique to China. When large industries in Europe, America, and Japan run aground, the government provides strong assistance or even secretly subsidizes them to prevent collapse. The reason why Shenxin adopted this strategy this time is to imitate this. Taking Shenxin as an example, the special tax paid to the country every day is more than 10,000 yuan, which amounts to more than 3 million yuan per year. After three and a half years, it has paid more than 10 million yuan in national taxes. Other wages, interest, materials, etc. are several times or dozens of times more than this. It cannot be said that there is no major relationship with national strength and people's livelihood. Government relief should also be possible. Therefore, after the presentation was submitted, the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry paid great attention to it. The Ministry of Industry drafted a plan for the Executive Yuan to adopt to maintain the national foundation, which is gratifying. However, the plan drafted by the Ministry of Industry abandons relief</p>
<p>and says reorganization and dispatching personnel to investigate and estimate Shenxin's assets. Since the promulgation of the plan, the newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai have competed to publish official news, saying that the candidates for the Shenxin Yarn Factory Reorganization Committee have been determined, and that the committee members investigating Shenxin's assets have completed the estimation of all assets. Recently, there have been rumors that the government is preparing to take over Shenxin and other factories, which is really</p>
<p>horrifying. The Shenxin and other factories have been established for two or three decades and have always been entirely commercial shares. This time, due to the impact of the entire global economic recession, the financing is temporarily sluggish, so we applied to the government for economic relief to maintain business. The focus is on economic relief, and the request is limited to economic relief. However, the Ministry of Industry, without investigation, rashly drafted a plan to reorganize. This move is trespassing on the authority of the Ministry of Finance and abusing its power over Shenxin. In terms of the current situation of the factory, whether it has not yet reached a standstill, there is no reorganization to speak of. Even if it has stagnated, before the original shareholders have agreed, how can there be the possibility of taking it over? Even in terms of the so-called estimation, such as Shenxin No. 9 Factory, which was completed in October last year, has more than 60 acres of factory land in the concession. According to the Public Works Department's valuation, the land price is 25,000 yuan per acre, and the factory building cost 2.2 million yuan. There are currently 80,000 spindles, 15,000 thread spindles, and 500 looms. According to the current cheapest price, it must be more than 8 million yuan. However, this time, after the investigation by the Ministry of Industry and the Cotton Control Committee, they rashly estimated it again, only estimating more than 4 million yuan. Although it cannot be said that there is another purpose for a factory that has only been newly built for a year and is only estimated at half the price, it is difficult to avoid</p>
<p>raising suspicion. For example, for other factories, the purchase price of each spindle must be at least 30 yuan, but now it is estimated at 17 yuan. If it is said that the age of the machine is high, I don't know whether the main parts of the machine body, although old, have been newly configured and are equal to the efficiency of the new machine. Otherwise, Shenxin's number of spindles accounts for one-fourth of the country. I have not heard of much inventory. Moreover, the 80-count fine yarn spun recently has created a new record in China's spinning industry, which also proves that the efficiency of the machinery is not bad. Rong, on the Shenxin side, has a 30-year history of struggle. He has suffered hardships in the past, but he has never sat idly by and watched it collapse. This time, in a crisis, if the government can sincerely help and provide economic assistance, then the future recovery can be predicted. Now, the Ministry of Industry's policy, as evidenced by the official news in the newspapers, has an intention to carve up the industry, so the shareholders of Wuxi Shenxin No. 43 Factory have</p>
<p>a telegram opposing the reorganization. Mr. Zongjing had previously announced his retirement due to old age and weakness, but now, due to the rise of rumors and the increasingly worsening situation, he had no choice but to re-emerge to shoulder the responsibility in response to the extraordinary situation. Therefore, he resolutely resumed his duties on the 20th, and the banking industry has also recently expressed unanimous support to promote this only national industry. In the past few days, the business has had amazing developments. Before the government can provide appropriate relief, Mr. Zongjing is prepared to work hard to maintain the critical situation and prevent the banking industry from being affected, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Qian Chengxu Reports on the Inspection of Factories in Various Countries <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>China's Industry is Still Better Than Other Countries, It Only Needs to Be Revitalized in Time to Find a Way Out</p>
<p>Qian Chengxu, the executive director of the China Industrial Federation, was dispatched as the employer representative to the International Labor Conference and went to Geneva to participate in the meeting. After the meeting, he was entrusted by various domestic factories to inspect the situation of the industrial circles of various countries and the systems of factory management. Now, Qian sent two communications from Rome, Italy, to the Xinsheng News Agency, reporting on the inspection situation as follows: (1) After a long period of consideration, the scope of inspection has now been finalized and will not be changed. The future report will include two major parts. The first part is the general situation of European and American countries in dealing with social problems. All issues such as social unemployment, labor legislation, reduced working hours, labor exchange, female worker protection, occupational diseases, trade union organizations, and labor savings and insurance are listed in the first part. The second part is the internal organization of factories in various countries. All matters concerning company power distribution, increasing efficiency, worker management, worker distribution, worker welfare, industrial safety, and factory inspection are listed in the second part. Because there are so many famous factories in Europe, it is not allowed in terms of time to inspect them one by one. Now, with the introduction of the League of Nations and a careful selection, it has been decided to inspect one to two factories in one country. In Germany, it is Siemens Electric Company and Zeiss Optical Lens Company; in Italy, it is Fei Ye Tuo Automobile Company; in the Netherlands, it is Philips Electric Bulb Company; in Sweden, it is Sangdai Steel Company; in France, it is Luns Mining Company; in the United Kingdom, it is London Transport Union; in Saar, it is the State-owned Mining Bureau; in the Czech Republic, it is Bajia Shoe Factory; in the United States, it is the American Transport Company. The above-listed locations are a total of ten. Each place is prepared to enter the factory for on-site inspection for six days. It is estimated that the work can be completed within two months. In addition, in various countries, there are also dock warehouse organizations, land and water transportation organizations, agricultural cooperation, production and marketing cooperation, and Denmark's field tax system, etc., all of which have research value, but I have to reluctantly give up because of the limited time and private economy, which I deeply regret. In recent years, Japan's industrial organization has made rapid progress. Its goods have recently reached the South Pacific Islands and even Europe and the United States. The progress of the yarn industry has long overthrown Lancashire in the United Kingdom, making India have to sign an economic agreement with it under conditions to maintain the vitality of the British cotton spinning industry. At this time of extreme global economic recession, the production of various countries is also shrinking, making it difficult to compete with. Investigating in Japan is also a matter of urgency. For this reason, I will spend more time when I return to the country from the UK across the Pacific Ocean to conduct on-site inspections and write a report to tell the people of the country. I have met with many economic experts and important government officials from various countries abroad. Every time I talk about Japan, they all unanimously refer to it as an economic invasion that should be resisted. However, when it comes to its industrial economy, they say that Japan is the only country in Asia with organized and industrialized science. If Chinese industrialists hear this kind of argument, I don't know what they would think. The purpose of my inspection this time is only to collect some materials related to industrial and commercial management in a short period of time and return them to the members of the China Industrial Association to facilitate their current reform of the factory system so that they can learn from it. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Europe and looking around, the degree of the world's economic recession is still evolving in multiplication and division. Almost all kinds of enterprise organizations are showing shrinkage and collapse. It is predicted that China will be in trouble in the future under the general environment, which may lead to a second world war and the evil consequences of re-dividing the East Asian market. For this reason, I had to change my original plan and shift my focus to the current social situation in the world and to study its fundamental diseases. Regarding this section, all of the labor legislation, social unemployment, production distribution, labor organization, etc. of various countries are all within the scope of must-be-inspected. The required labor will inevitably be greater, but Geneva has always been the center for all walks of life in the world to explore social and economic issues. The collection of materials and the guidance of experts can all be adequately supplied and assisted. I only spent ten days here, and the details and outlines of what should be inspected have been largely determined. In the future, traveling to various countries, following the map to find the way, will not take much time, and I deeply believe that the future report will reach the country and will be suitable for China's situation and give general readers satisfaction.</p>
<p>Each country is superior. Because China is not originally an industrial country, it has various social and economic conditions. What is considered necessary in industrial countries is not felt to be needed in the country. Therefore, the impact of the world's economic recession is the latest. Even in terms of the current situation, there is still room for maneuver and resistance for a considerable period. As for Europe, its golden age has passed. From July 1933 to the present, the number of productions in various countries has actually decreased to more than 30% on average in surveys that cannot be published. The average discount on all accumulated commodities is also below half, so they all have to adopt a high tariff policy to maintain their own destiny. Recently, the British House of Commons put forward a bill advocating to further increase tariffs on imported goods to the extent that it is sufficient to protect domestic industry. At the same time, the German Minister of Finance also issued a declaration to stop purchasing foreign raw materials. In addition, in the British and Dutch South Pacific territories, tariffs on Japan will be increased separately to prevent dumping. All these kinds of situations are enough to show that the economies of various countries in the world are in extreme panic. I don't know what the situation will be after 1935. Our country has always been a self-sufficient country. As long as we revitalize in time, we may be able to find a way out in this harsh global environment, which is not impossible in fact.</p>

<p>Over 17,600 bales expected in Shanghai by the end of the month</p>
<p>After the amendment of the American loan cotton contract, the first batch of 20,809 bales had already been shipped on the Fen Lei Na轮 (Fen Lei Na Steamship) on the 17th of this month and unloaded at the Pu 朿華 (Pu Ci Hua) warehouse, as previously reported in this newspaper. According to our reporter's investigation, the total amount of cotton shipped from the United States this time is 120,000 bales, divided into seven shipments to Shanghai. The first ship departed from the United States on June 1st (i.e., arrived in Shanghai on July 17th). The second ship, the 福倫倍克 (Fu Lun Bei Ke), Farnbank, carrying a total of 17,657 bales, weighing a massive 9,000 tons, left the United States on June 15th. We received a telegram yesterday stating that it is expected to enter the port on the 30th of this month and will also be unloaded at the 華 (Hua) warehouse. The third ship left the United States on the 1st of this month, and the fourth ship will depart on the 15th of this month. Each ship carries approximately 20,000 bales. It is estimated that all seven shipments of American cotton will arrive in Shanghai completely before the end of October.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Holders of 96 Public Bonds Telegraph the Ministry of Finance Requesting Reorganization <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance replies with disapproval</p>
<p>The 申時社 (Shen Shi News Agency) reports that there were rumors last month about the reorganization of the 96 public bonds, which briefly pushed the price above the 20 yuan mark. These public bonds were issued by the old Northern Government, so most of the bondholders are in the North. They have been inquiring with the 銀綫業公會 (Silver Thread Industry Association) about the reorganization plan. The 銀錢業公會 (Silver Money Industry Association), based on the declaration of bondholders after the January 28th Incident, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance replied that due to various irregularities during the issuance of the 96 bonds, it is difficult to reorganize them at this time. The declaration of the bondholders is only a unilateral hope and cannot be used as a basis for approval. The local banking community has received telegrams between the Beijing 銀錢業 (Silver Money Industry) and the Ministry of Finance, indicating that reorganization is still a long way off. The 申時社 (Shen Shi News Agency) reporter has transcribed the original text as follows: The Beijing 銀錢業公會 (Silver Money Industry Association) telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance, we have investigated that the 96 bonds and the two reorganized bonds were almost entirely purchased by Northern merchants and civilians during their issuance. Although a small number have been transferred to Shanghai, the majority remains in the North. For more than ten years, the principal and interest have not been paid, and reorganization has been unheard of. The Northern people and businesses holding these bonds are in dire straits, like those drowning or on fire, and the situation has long been known to your Ministry. Recently, the Minister visited 平 (Ping) to investigate business conditions, and the 平 (Ping) citizens and the public eagerly hope for reorganization. These two bonds would rescue the Northern market, like waiting for rain during a severe drought. Therefore, they inquire with the association about this matter daily, and those who bitterly recount their hardships number dozens each day. Therefore, our association convened a general meeting, and it was stated that after the Shanghai Incident in February of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), the prices of government bonds plummeted. The 96 bonds and the two reorganized bonds were similarly affected. At that time, the bondholders negotiated with the government to extend the repayment period and reduce the interest rates of various bonds, and there were 14 articles of reorganization of the principal and interest of the 96 bonds and the two reorganized bonds. The bondholders issued a declaration, and the government issued a clear order and your Ministry issued a proclamation, each with a record. Since that declaration, your Ministry has never been late in repaying the principal and interest of various bonds, demonstrating great credibility, which is admired by the whole country. However, upon investigating Article 14 of the declaration of bondholders, it states that the Ministry of Finance should allocate funds within three years to repay the principal and interest of the 96 bonds and the two reorganized bonds, and the method will be determined by the Ministry of Finance. Now, two and a half years have passed, and no preparations have been made. The number of Northern civilians holding these two types of bonds is very large. They urgently hope to implement the aforementioned declaration, reorganize these two bonds, so that the market can circulate, which is urgently needed for the local situation. Our association immediately unanimously decided to appeal on their behalf and respectfully telegraphed your Ministry for review and approval. We hope that your Ministry will consider that these two types of bonds are of great importance to the Northern people and market and approve the maintenance of the previous plan, promptly plan the reorganization method to relieve the people's difficulties, which is both a public and private virtue." The Ministry of Finance replied, stating: "The Beijing 銀錢業 (Silver Money Industry) Association, we have read your telegram. The amount of the 96 bonds and the two reorganized bonds issued by the old government in Beijing was unlimited, the use of the funds is difficult to verify, and the guarantee fund was not clearly designated. It is difficult for our Ministry to handle. When the interest rates and repayment periods of various bonds were reduced during the previous consultation, although the representatives of the bondholder association proposed reorganization, there were many difficulties in reality. The declaration of the bondholder association regarding internal debt is only a hope of the bondholders themselves, and our Ministry has no approved plan. Currently, the treasury reserves are extremely strained, making it impossible to handle. Please be informed." (Seal of the Ministry of Finance)</p>
<h3 id="e133">Wu Zhihui's Letter to Chen Gongbo <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Reorganization of the Shen Xin Factory</p>
<p>The 新新社 (Xin Xin News Agency) reports that the reorganization of the Shen Xin, Fu Xin, and Mao Xin textile and flour mills has been formally denied by Rong Zongjing, the founder and current general manager of these factories. We have learned that Wu Zhihui, a member of the Central Committee, recently sent a letter to Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry, in which he made poignant and humorous statements about the actual situation of the Shen Xin factories and the reorganization. The 新新社 (Xin Xin News Agency) reporter has found the original text as follows: "To Mr. Gongbo, I am pleased to hear that you have been working tirelessly day and night for the safety of the early Xin. I am extremely impressed. The plan for creditors and government representation that you have presented, which is based on scientific methods, is naturally the right path, and I would not dare to add anything further. However, I have something to contribute to dispel the creditors' fear of the saying you heard from the creditors, 'It is not difficult to maintain, but the biggest fear is restoration.' I can further explain the core of what I said in my previous letter. The 'core' I mentioned in my previous letter does not refer to the position of Mr. Rong personally. When I used this phrase in the case, I was afraid of creating a problem with the wording, so I added a clarification at the end of the letter, stating that 'The 'core' mentioned in the letter does not refer to the recent changes in nominal managers, etc. These are internal routine matters that can be changed as appropriate.' Therefore, regarding what you heard the creditors say, 'Taking Mr. Rong as the center, I am afraid of repeating the mistakes of lack of organization and management,' I absolutely do not mean to take Mr. Rong as the center. I believe that regardless of who is taken as the center, if there is a lack of organization and management, the same mistakes will inevitably be repeated. Moreover, the Rong mentioned, or perhaps the Shen Xin becoming the private property of an individual surname, I am convinced that Mr. Rong does not have this intention, at least I am convinced that Mr. Rong Zongjing personally does not have this intention. The reason for my conviction is based on my own theory. Throughout my life, I most admire Chinese individuals, but I do not want China's future to be like them, namely wealthy individuals who maintain their fortunes and quickly pack up their old businesses that have reached millions, saying that if they can do this, it is enough, and knowing when to stop can avoid danger. In the past twenty years, influenced by the West, some have expanded to tens of millions while maintaining their fortunes, but these are all rich people, not new-style entrepreneurs. China cannot compete with the world in commercial warfare because of this. The distinction between wealthy people and entrepreneurs is the big question of whether capitalists should be immediately overthrown. Wealthy people-style capitalists should undoubtedly be immediately overthrown, or at least overthrown soon. The Premier did not want to abolish capitalists abruptly, referring to the capitalists who are entrepreneurs, who are actually a transitional product of evolution, and not only should they not be immediately overthrown, but they should also be relatively encouraged. There is another type of person that I want China's future to emulate, but I personally have doubts day and night, and I dare not associate with them and have decided not to emulate them. I laugh at myself for only being given a sesame seed-sized piece of courage by Yan Luo Wang (King of Hell), while millions and tens of millions of people</p>
<h3 id="e134">Maintain Their Fortunes <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Even Yan Luo Wang (King of Hell) does not allow them to dream of it. This person I do not want to emulate is a daring and enterprising figure. I believe that daring and enterprising figures are actually unscrupulous profiteers. The distinction between them cannot be made with precision, and even children can know it in their hearts even if they cannot say it. That is, whether the person fundamentally has a fraudulent mind is obvious, and cannot be concealed in the end. However, I am too lazy to distinguish, because there are unscrupulous profiteers all over China, so according to my nature, whenever I encounter someone who is slightly skilled and temporarily successful, I think they are just having good luck, and the end is coming. I measure them in this way, but sometimes I ask myself if it is too unreasonable to dismiss them all like this, so I also observe them from time to time, and I feel that they fundamentally do not have a fraudulent mind, and I feel that their ability to achieve great success is due to their unique talent for taking risks. I believe that Mr. Rong personally has a talent for taking risks. From a business perspective, putting such people on the battlefield of world commercial warfare makes them valuable figures, and maintaining their fortunes may not be their strength. They are entrepreneurs. In this era of commercial warfare, China can either choose not to join the commercial war, or if it knows that there is no hope for domestic products to stand on their own without participating in the commercial war, then a wise society should protect such figures, and a wise government should especially protect them. That is, even without adhering to maintaining their position, they should also protect their personality and their spirit. The 'core' that I mentioned that cannot be lost is the spirit of Mr. Rong's talent for taking risks. You also heard people say, 'Mr. Rong has only been issuing empty checks in recent times,' and you think that Mr. Rong is close to unscrupulous profiteering, which raises a question about his personality. This person is inevitably very wrong. This is the responsibility of society, and especially the responsibility of the government. All countries help such enterprising figures through society and the government, so that checks do not end up being empty checks. Who actually has a gold mine or silver mine with thirty miles of surrounding land passed down from their ancestors to be entrepreneurs from the beginning? Therefore, the saying 'The biggest fear is restoration' is only a lighthearted expression of humor. Once it is heavily relayed by others, it can turn Mr. Rong into something that is truly unacceptable, and rewards and punishments become unclear, which inevitably discourages heroes. In terms of ordinary Chinese individuals, who would not want to own a few million, maintain their fortunes, and be a wealthy person for life, going to the mountains to escape the heat in this sweltering weather and enjoy their remaining years? Who would want one factory or two factories, even ten factories or eight factories without end, and still</p>
<h3 id="e135">Eagerly Advance <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>This is really driven by a spirit of adventure, and it is definitely not just the obsession of the God of Wealth. It must be known that the God of Wealth is the most stingy and is unwilling to obsess people with shocking numbers. He gives a little, and if they do not maintain their fortunes, he will take it away. Therefore, the creditors' so-called 'Wait until the debts are cleared, and then return everything to Mr. Rong, which is the intention of honoring virtue and repaying merit,' is like the clay bodhisattva in the God of Wealth temple, who often has this temper. It is definitely not appropriate in today's world where countries are standing side by side in a commercial death struggle. According to my ideal, both sides will lose. The first loss is that there is a great intention to clear the debts and disband immediately, as if being bitten by a white dog, they should be afraid of even seeing a white sheep. Creditors do not dare to lend money, and even American banks did not believe it the year before last and learned from us by opening a secret vault to store cash. This is the root cause of the worldwide economic downturn in recent years, so Roosevelt resolutely intervened, and the American financial community also made relative corrections. Our government should not support this passive approach. Another loss is that after working hard to pay off Mr. Rong's debts, they take a large sum of money to honor merit and repay virtue, persuading him to maintain his fortune from now on and open a vault for storage, purely turning Mr. Rong into a wealthy person. Our government would be no different from overthrowing entrepreneurs to reward wealthy people, which is not justifiable. What is called the commercial world, what is called finance? We outsiders firmly believe that it is lending money, managing businesses, and using credit to circulate in the market. Lending only to wealthy people and not to entrepreneurs is a passive commercial world, a rigid finance, with no fighting power, and further, it is a state of economic downturn. Lending absolutely recklessly and randomly is naturally unreasonable, but those who manage businesses should hope that they are entrepreneurs, and those who lend money should also hope that they are entrepreneurs. If they cannot see clearly with their eyes and cannot open their hands, there is no talent for taking risks, and there are not many people who can be called entrepreneurs now. If a person has virtue to honor and merit to repay, and the person has shortcomings, they must have strengths. Is it not worth cherishing heroes and using scientific methods to remedy their shortcomings and use their strengths to pull businesses along with entrepreneurs, creating a positive commercial world? My blind thoughts are not completely worthless, so why should everyone pack up and make people work hard,</p>
<h3 id="e136">Pay Off Debts <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>And repay people, take the remaining money, and enjoy themselves? What I said in my previous letter, 'I am afraid that it will be regarded as ordinary commercial gains and losses, or biased towards passive maintenance. If the core is lost and foreign forces destroy it, who knows that it will not shrink from passivity and eventually collapse,' is because I knew this would happen. However, these passive methods are formed because of 'The biggest fear is restoration.' Why fear restoration? Because of 'Fear of taking Mr. Rong as the center and repeating the mistakes of lack of organization and management.' Lack of organization and management, and the same mistakes have been repeated, is naturally something that is unacceptable, and this restoration naturally cannot be allowed to happen again. However, to simply make a judgment, asking why a person with no organization or management has virtue and merit, and he has repeated a mistake, why should he be honored and repaid? Is it not just too humorous? Therefore, everyone enthusiastically hopes that Mr. Rong will take another step forward and immediately adopt an even better organization and an even better management that is convincing. However, if Mr. Rong's past is immediately criticized as lacking organization and management, it is like what Mencius said, "Zhou left the people, and there was no one left." The words have harmed the meaning, and the meaning has harmed the ambition. Not only is our old organization and old management definitely not competent, but the current huge business will also be difficult to support. If the previous business is forced to be supported, the same mistakes may be repeated. If it has not been repeated, and if this failure is considered a repetition, it would be too wrong to wrong Mr. Rong in this way. I will tell you more below, and now I will conclude with organization and management. Therefore, Mr. Rong used the old organization and old management in the past, and he had his talents. Not only was the old organization and old management not relaxed, but the application was based on his heart, and some small tricks and details must still be worth retaining if experts carefully study them and improve them to suit the Chinese situation. I am speculating and have not seen it with my own eyes, because if he did not have his organization and his management, how could the business have expanded to such an extent, and why would foreigners see him as a thorn in their side, and would definitely want to bring him down? Otherwise, he would not have time to bring himself down, so there is no need to use great effort to destroy the decaying. Therefore, saying that Mr. Rong is without organization and management is an exaggeration, and I definitely do not believe it. Even real experts, who do not only understand a few words from books, would not be willing to make this definite denial. I have already said above that I believe that Mr. Rong will not turn Shen Xin into</p>
<h3 id="e137">Rong's Private Property <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Then there would be no restoration, and there would be nothing to talk about restoring or not restoring. Now, let's discuss whether Mr. Rong's mistakes have been repeated. As far as I know, there is no talk of repeating mistakes. I heard that most people have investigated and found that after offsetting the assets and debts, there is a loss of more than 10 million. However, the Ministry of Finance's investigation says that the assets are 68 million, and there is a slight surplus after offsetting the debts. This is the credible part of the government's investigation. The difference between the two departments is that one believes that the mistakes have been repeated, and it is as if the assets and inventory of a closed shop should be heavily discounted, while the other believes that it is a normal factory inspection and only gives a fair discount, so there is a difference of more than 10 million. Mr. Rong's side naturally says that his own son is good, and of course the discount is even smaller, and he even says that there is a surplus of more than 10 million. If we compromise and believe the Ministry of Finance's investigation, it just means that Shen Xin factory's capital belongs to others, so what is there to say? Originally, which big company or big bank's capital does not belong to others? Therefore, without the Shen Xin factory, saying that Mr. Rong has tens of thousands of families of wealth is a long-standing rumor, and the newspaper reports saying that Shen Xin owes more than 60 million, not counting the assets, means that Mr. Rong Zongjing has lost everything, which is probably a joke. The creditors within the 60 million also include shares, and it is feared that Mr. Rong's shares are considerable, so if he packs up from now on, he will not fail to be a wealthy person, which can be believed. However, if rumors arise that the mistakes have been repeated, then the creditors will not give in to each other, and the litigation will last for years, the machines will rust, and no one will buy the large plot of land at a low price, and the interest will be added every day, so the debts will greatly exceed the current valuation of the assets. Most of the discount and the Ministry of Finance are unwilling to estimate, so it is better to ask the old goods stores on Beijing Road to estimate. Then, ideally, there will only be 10 million left. Three years after closing the doors, Mr. Rong really lost 60 million, and it is not known whether today's newspaper reports will be wrong. Therefore, Mr. Rong's mistakes have not been repeated today. Whether it is desired to repeat it or not is also in society,</p>
<h3 id="e138">Also in the Government <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>So why is Mr. Rong not successful today? It is said that the financial situation is stranded. Why is it stranded? It is affected by the world's economic downturn and is not absolutely in organization and management. Moreover, such stranding happens to ordinary stores every day. Mr. Rong's business is large, and when he can turn it around, it is as if there is a gold mine or silver mine in the house, and when he cannot turn it around, problems arise. Such problems have arisen several times before the National Government, and there was no connection between them. Several times, the wise society maintained it and turned it around immediately. Now, there is no difference from the previous times. Since there is a wise society and a wise government, a ladle of water will be poured down, and the bow of the ship will move immediately. If even better organization and even better management are added, I am afraid that the next time it is stranded, it will be even smoother. If there is no illness but groaning, it should be treated as a living horse and fed some materials, rather than being treated as a dead horse and having a major operation. If there is mutual panic, it will be pulled down without much effort. Today, if any big company or big bank is investigated as if it has been repeated, and the discount is arbitrarily determined, then there is no company or bank that will not fail. Even every foreign king can fail by 80 or 90 percent. Therefore, a wise society and a wise government must discover that it is not reckless speculation and easily maintain it, and the entrepreneur will stand firm. Therefore, regarding the saying 'The biggest fear is restoration,' I have spent seven or eight pages to tell Mr. Chen Gongbo for the sake of comforting the creditors in case they make a mistake and really destroy Mr. Rong, and the creditors will be the first to suffer. Although it is thorny, it is not necessary to reply. I respectfully wish you peace. Your younger brother, Jing Heng, respectfully bows."</p>

<p>Extracting Five Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government, considering that the weather has been dry since the beginning of summer, affecting the livelihood of the people, urgently sought to provide relief. Therefore, it formulated drought relief implementation measures. On the one hand, it prepared a letter and sent personnel to the Provincial Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Factory to negotiate the rental of water pumps, which would be distributed to various districts for subletting and application. On the other hand, it printed and distributed the measures to various districts, instructing the township chiefs to implement them earnestly. Now, the measures are extracted as follows: (1) If the water pumps are insufficient, the rice milling machines will be ordered to be converted into water pumps. (2) If there are surplus manual or animal-powered waterwheels prepared by the people in this county, the district will collect them and lend them to other places in need. (3) If the manual waterwheels in each district are insufficient, the district and township offices will investigate and persuade wealthy farmers to purchase additional ones. (4) Farmers who are unable to afford the cost of digging wells, building dams to store water, and purchasing waterwheels can apply for loans from rural credit funds. (5) For agricultural plants that cannot be sown due to drought or that have withered due to lack of irrigation, the public will be persuaded to quickly change to drought-resistant plants.</p>

<p>Eliminate the Gap between Hui and Han, and Jointly Plan National Affairs. Delegates Assembly to be Held Next Month.</p>
<p>Since the fall of the Northeast, the Japanese have been scheming to occupy it for a long time. Recently, a Japanese man named 川村狂堂 (Kawamura Kyodo) has been using the name of Islam to organize a "Islamic Association" in the puppet state of Changchun, intending to lure and benefit the two million Islamic people of the Northeast to realize his dream of the Great Asian Alliance. This matter was learned by Lu Zhongxiang, the Director-General of the Chinese Islamic Cultural Association in this city, who was deeply afraid of shaking the hearts of the Islamic people of the Northeast and using the power of Islam to plot aggression in the Northwest. Since the matter concerns the fate of the country and the future of the nation, it is extremely worrying. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 24th, he invited 11 people, including the Executive Directors of the Association, Ma Tianying, Chuantong Xian, Wang Yi, Ma Fuguo, and the consultant of the Association, Wang Huapu, to an emergency meeting at Yanyuan in Jiangwan to discuss how to express serious opposition and concrete plans. The meeting was chaired by Ma Tianying and recorded by Wang Yi, and discussed many important cases, including: (1) Petitioning the central government to give Islamic people equal opportunities in education based on the principle of ethnic equality. (2) Uniting Islamic organizations in various regions to establish cultural undertakings. (3) Provisionally deciding to hold a Shanghai Islamic People's Congress in August to jointly plan the nation. (4) Publishing a letter to the Islamic People of the Northeast, drafted by Lu Zhongxiang on the spot. Now, the full text is extracted as follows: "Dear elders, gentlemen, ladies, and fellow Islamic people of the Northeast, the Islamic people are a pillar constituting the entire Chinese nation. The relationship between the Islamic people and the Chinese nation has a long history, which is known to all our religious people. Therefore, although our faith belongs to Islam, our country is the Republic of China. The Quran shows us the importance of loving and protecting our country and people in various ways, which is sufficient to show that loyalty to the country is the duty of the Islamic people. Now, our strong enemy to the east occupies our Northeast, devastates our compatriots, and uses a puppet to claim to be emperor in the puppet capital, taking the Northeast as its own and regarding justice as nothing. However, their ambitions have not been extinguished. Now, they are using the name of Islam to establish an 'Islamic Association' in the puppet capital. The purpose is to lure and benefit the pure Islamic people, anesthetize Islamic youth, and attempt to expand their power in the Northeast, so that they can have the Northwest as well. How can our Northeast religious people be willing to be used in this kind of heartless and crazy thing, and how can our national religious people, whose lips and teeth are related, bear to sit idly by and let it happen? It must be known that betraying the party and the country is not allowed by national law, let alone deviating from the scriptures and rebelling against the Tao, which is not the attitude that our sincere religious people should have. However, we firmly believe that the national religious people have a strong belief (Imani) and hold a spirit of indomitable peace and patriotism, and will never be easily deceived and go astray, which we are deeply comforted by. Looking around at the national situation, externally, there is the aggressive pressure of imperialism, and internally, there is the fear of the Red Bandits harming our people. In this time of national crisis and turbulent times, all of us five million Islamic compatriots, who claim to be patriotic, have been boiling with patriotic fervor all day long, especially the Northeast religious people who are under the iron heel of the strong enemy. Therefore, if we want to serve the country in the future, the only way out is to eliminate all obstacles between the Hui and Han, work hard to unite, and save the religion to survive. The mission of this association is to communicate the boundaries of Hui and Han culture to create an environment for coexistence and common prosperity, uphold the Prime Minister's principle of ethnic equality, support each other, and carry out educational and publicity work to protect the national lifeline. Although the beloved religious people and compatriots in the Northeast are living a slave life in deep water and fire, the people of the country, both in the government and the public, are deeply sympathizing with them every day. We deeply hope that all our religious people will uphold the principle of respecting heaven and loving people of the Holy Prophet Muhammad, work hard to survive and jointly plan national affairs, not be used by foreigners, be willing to be their pawns, and fall into the ridicule of being running dogs. It is better to be a model in history than to be a dung beetle for ten thousand years. Please, Islamic compatriots in the Northeast, rise up in response. Once the government issues an order, the lost land of thirty million miles in the Northeast will be recovered only by our five million Islamic people. The telegram is urgent, and the attachment is unbearable. Written with respect by the Chinese Islamic Cultural Association and all the Islamic people."</p>
<h3 id="e141">The Japanese Textile Manufacturers Association in China Requests Reduction of Cotton Import Tax <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Funatsu Seeks Opinions from Chinese Yarn Merchants; Minister Kong Explains in Detail the Cotton Tax Increase</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, after the implementation of the new import taxes in our country, the Japanese Textile Manufacturers Association in China, led by Chairman Funatsu Tatsujiro, has not only requested a reduction in cotton import taxes but also visited Minister Kong to solicit opinions from leaders in our textile industry. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Please Restore the Old Tax Rate: The association requests the Ministry of Finance to reduce the cotton import tax rate and restore the old tax rate, citing the following reasons: (1) Increasing cotton import tariffs will effectively block exports, leading to an oversupply of products, a drop in market prices, and ultimately the decline of the cotton industry. As a result, cotton farming will be negatively affected. (A) Currently, the cotton yarn and fabric industry in the Republic of China, although forced to shorten working hours to a certain extent due to the weakened purchasing power of the people, is still inevitably facing an oversupply. Therefore, it relies entirely on actively promoting the export of surplus products to maintain the balance between supply and demand. However, the cotton products of competing countries in the destinations of these exports use tax-free raw materials, making competition extremely difficult. (B) The cotton import tax initially started at only six jiao of silver per dan, then increased to one tael and two qian. By May of last year, it had further increased to 3.50 customs taels of silver per 100 kilograms, which meant a tax of about 17 yuan per bale of cotton yarn. This time, it has been further increased to 5.00 customs taels of silver per 100 kilograms, which means a tax of 24 yuan per bale of cotton yarn. This is about six to seven times the initial tax rate. Imposing such a heavy tax will inevitably lead to the cessation of product exports. (C) If cotton product exports cease, the result will be trade deterioration externally and the wasteful dumping of surplus products internally, along with fierce competition among spinning mills. This will inevitably lead to an expansion of the scope of shortened working hours or the forced closure of factories, increasing the number of unemployed workers. Consequently, cotton consumption will decrease, leading to a drop in cotton market prices, which will not benefit the rural areas or help encourage cotton planting. (2) Increasing import tariffs on raw cotton will increase the burden on domestic consumer classes. (A) The average annual import volume of foreign cotton into China over the past five years is approximately 3.27 million dan. Due to climate and soil conditions, most of these foreign cotton species are not suitable for cultivation in China. To achieve self-sufficiency, it will take many years. Therefore, suddenly increasing tariffs today and providing protection cannot be expected to rapidly increase production. (B) Today, rural infrastructure has not yet been implemented, and its effects are not yet visible. A sudden increase in tariffs will not prevent the import of these special raw cotton varieties, but will only increase the tax burden on domestic consumer classes, reducing their purchasing power.</p>
<p>Minister Kong's Explanation: Funatsu Tatsujiro, Chairman of the Japanese Textile Manufacturers Association in China,</p>
<p>believes that the increase in cotton import taxes after the implementation of the new import tariff regulations in our country has a significant impact on Japanese textile factories in China. He sought the opinions of leaders in our country's yarn industry, such as Nie Lusheng, on the increase in cotton import taxes in his private capacity. On Thursday of the previous week, he visited Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi at the Central Bank on the Bund to state the reasons for requesting the revocation of the new cotton import tax policy. Minister Kong explained in detail that the purpose of increasing cotton import taxes this time is to help our country's rural areas and encourage cotton farmers. At the same time, customs revenue will increase. As for the reduction of taxes on cotton textiles and paper, they have been carefully reviewed repeatedly. Therefore, he does not agree to reduce the cotton import tax.</p>
<p>Funatsu's Remarks: A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency visited Funatsu Tatsujiro, Chairman of the Japanese Textile Manufacturers Association in China, yesterday morning. According to him, the reasons for the association's request to reduce cotton import taxes have been detailed to the Ministry of Finance. Minister Kong's opinions on the tax increase are well-reasoned, but in fact, the workers employed by Japanese textile mills in China are all Chinese, making them no different from Chinese factories. Only the capital belongs to Japanese merchants. China's annual exports of cotton yarn and cloth, such as 541,000 dan of cotton yarn and 288,000 dan of cloth heads last year, are all produced by Japanese yarn mills and Chinese yarn mills in China. After the raw cotton tax increases, it will be impossible to promote these exports abroad and instead promote them domestically, which will intensify the business competition between Chinese yarn mills and Japanese yarn mills. In the future, both Chinese and Japanese yarn mills will suffer significant losses.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Merchants Held a Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Signed a Shipping Cooperation Agreement</p>
<p>After a two-week trial run of cooperation between Shanghai and Tianjin shipping merchants, which began on the 18th of last month, it was decided to continue due to the good results. The participants include the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and 21 private companies: Sanbei, Zhengji, Yuda, Zhidong, Haichang, Beifang, Zhaoxing, Datongxing, Huitong, Yong'an, Tianjin, Zhongtai, Hefeng, Huatong, Funing, Shun'an, Shenquan, Shou Kang, Yuanxing, Huaning, etc. They signed the Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Cooperation Agreement the day before yesterday. However, the participation of British companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire is based on an agreement signed with the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which is responsible for handling it.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Joint Association: The participating shipping companies have established the Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Joint Association, dedicated to handling cooperation matters. The location is inside the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association on Guangdong Road. A joint meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to establish the joint association. The committee members were nominated by each shipping company, one person per company. All participating shipping companies are required not to violate the agreement. Each member must deposit a guarantee of 2,000 yuan with the joint association, which will be transferred to the bank to earn interest.</p>
<p>Priority for Grain: The cooperation agreement stipulates that priority is given to rice and flour because the transportation of rice and flour from Shanghai to Tianjin is the largest volume. The freight rate and commission are unified. The price charged by each shipping company must be listed with the name of the goods on the manifest after export and sent to the joint association to be forwarded to all shipping companies that have joined the agreement. The freight rates for other goods will be gradually processed.</p>

<p>The military bands used for weddings and funerals in this city have costumes that are strange and flamboyant, and the music scores do not distinguish between joyful and mournful tunes, which is far from the way to promote propriety and music. This city is a major trading port, and the eyes of Chinese and foreigners are upon it, so the matter is of great importance. The Social Bureau of this city has been ordered to draft orchestra registration regulations, which have been approved by the municipal government. Registration will begin on August 1st and will last for three months. It is said that the registration procedure will be kept simple and no fees will be charged. The purpose is to supervise the orchestras in the city and jointly seek improvements. Those who fail to register after the deadline will be strictly dealt with.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Fruit Vendors in the Concession Gathered Yesterday to Implement Disruption <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Melons and Fruits Scattered in Front of Goods Stores in Various Places</p>
<p>The Trade Association Admonishes Strict Adherence to Order</p>
<p>Fruit peddlers in the Shanghai International Settlement area, due to the overly strict crackdown by the police, have found it difficult to make a living. Several hundred of them gathered a few days ago to petition the Chamber of Commerce and the Citizens' Association and held a meeting at the Chinese Public Garden, which was dispersed by the authorities, resulting in no outcome. After deliberation yesterday, several hundred peddlers were assigned to groups and went to the vicinity of goods stores in various places such as the Sixteen Pontoons, the Old Zha Gate Bridge, and the New Zha Gate Bridge to destroy melons. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Implementing Disruption: Peddlers in the Shanghai International Settlement area have always been selling along the roads, but they are of mixed quality, so some peddlers are disliked. The Second District Citizens' Association requested the Municipal Council to stop them. The Municipal Council agreed to the request and sent police vehicles to arrest and punish them at any time, sometimes three or four times in one place. Therefore, it is difficult to make a living and maintain a livelihood. Several hundred peddlers gathered a few days ago to petition the Chamber of Commerce and the Citizens' Association. Because there was no satisfactory result, it was decided by the general meeting to carry out disruptive actions in the vicinity of goods stores. If a customer buys watermelons or various fresh fruits, they will be attacked as soon as they leave the store, resulting in a mess on the ground, beyond repair. They scatter in all directions, and the buyers can only shout helplessly.</p>
<p>Unable to Sell: Yesterday morning around 5:00 AM, these peddlers were disrupting business in the South City Sixteen Pontoons, the North City Old Zha Gate Bridge, the New Zha Gate Bridge, and the Hongkou Wusong Road, forcibly preventing buying and selling. Goods stores in various places reported to the police to send police to stop them because it concerned the entire business. But they came and went without being caught, so the melons were all stored in the stores, unable to be sold. The villagers were very frustrated because the melons they carried could not be stored for long in the hot weather, and if they were stored for a long time, they would rot.</p>
<p>Trade Association Opinion: According to the person in charge of the local Goods Trade Association, the members of the association reported to the association this morning (the 25th) that fruit peddlers in the Shanghai International Settlement area have been forced to stop business because they are unable to make a living due to the strict crackdown by the authorities. Many peddlers have been assigned to wait on the roads near the stores, prohibiting other peddlers from buying goods and doing business from the stores. After investigation by the association, it is confirmed that this is true, and attempts have been made to persuade them, but it is difficult to avoid. However, if the authorities do not resolve this dispute immediately, it is feared that it will expand further and become difficult to manage. In the association's opinion, it should be discussed from two aspects. For the peddlers, in order to maintain their livelihoods, they must ask the authorities to handle the matter leniently. This negotiation should be organized and must strictly adhere to order, without hindering public security. It is not appropriate to use coercive means to prohibit other peddlers from doing business. If this is done, although it is out of anger, it is actually a criminal act. In reason, several representatives should be elected to petition the authorities, requesting that the usual practice be maintained so that peddlers can make a living, or ask local citizen groups for assistance. Furthermore, it is not appropriate for the peddlers to stop business because of this, because if the peddlers do not do business for one day, they will not be able to live for one day. They should continue to do business and temporarily try to avoid the crackdown by the authorities while negotiating. A considerable solution can be obtained. For the authorities, they should take into account the livelihood of the general small-business citizens and cannot only consider administrative measures. They should know that the peddlers are all forced to enter the city due to social and economic difficulties and rural bankruptcy, unable to make a living in their hometowns, and make small profits by selling small items to support the lives of several family members. Therefore, the authorities should take both sides into account when cracking down on peddlers within the settlement and handle the matter flexibly and leniently. Then this dispute can be eliminated invisibly. Otherwise, if it is not resolved for a long time, it may hinder local security.</p>

<p>The Sophistication of the Equipment is Unprecedented in the Far East; Completion is Expected in December</p>
<p>The City Ferry Management Office of the Shanghai Xingye Trust Company has been working hard to develop urban routes and improve various facilities. Recently, it has obtained the approval of the Municipal Council to build a double-decker pier on the Bund outside Beijing Road. Construction began the day before yesterday. The Shenshi News Agency reporter reports on the details below.</p>
<h3 id="e146">The Sophistication of the Equipment is Unprecedented in the Far East <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>This type of double-decker pier, built on the Bund outside Beijing Road near the Bronze Statue Pier, is made of steel and can be boarded and disembarked from both the upper and lower levels. It also has two floating bridges, not only for the convenience of passengers but also for the comfort and safety of travelers. The sophistication and completeness of the equipment are unprecedented in the Far East. It has now been contracted to the HeXing Shipyard and is valued at over 70,000 yuan. Construction began a few days ago and is expected to be completed in mid-December of this year.</p>

<h3 id="e148">The Municipal Council Considers the Safety of Pedestrians on the Road <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Inquiring About Everything from Police Departments in Various Cities in the United States</p>
<p>Please, the Police Department, Pay Close Attention to the Safety of Pedestrians</p>
<p>A director of the Municipal Council recently made two suggestions regarding the safety of pedestrians on the road: one is to widely publicize the dangers of crossing the road and wandering on the road in important places, and the other is to establish safe zones for pedestrians to cross the street, similar to other cities. This proposal was submitted to the Traffic Committee for discussion. According to the report of the Chief of Police, most of the people injured in road accidents are illiterate, so the effectiveness of danger warning signs is doubtful. Also, not many accidents occur at intersections, but more occur because pedestrians rush across in front of fast-moving vehicles. Currently, the guidance on paying attention to danger is provided by public storytellers who explain to the public, and most important intersections have yellow parallel lines for pedestrians to pass. But in fact, very few people use them. As for setting up safe pedestrian platforms on the road, it is difficult to do because the roads are not wide and there are tram tracks on Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road. A committee member said that in the northern United States, they tried to implement a method that required pedestrians to cross the street at designated locations and obey the instructions of traffic police, but the public was unwilling to cooperate, resulting in no effect. The traffic problem in Shanghai is even more complicated, and piecemeal reforms are impossible without thorough and careful study. For reference, the police departments in various cities in the United States can be asked about their classification and analysis methods for road accidents. After discussion, it was agreed that the safety of pedestrians is becoming increasingly important and that the Police Department should pay more attention to it at any time.</p>
<p>the suffering of travelers from the wind and dew and reduce crowding. In addition, the Pujiang night shift operated by the office for the convenience of citizens to cool off has been well received by all sectors of society, so it has been decided to continue until the autumn is cool.</p>

<p>Also, regarding the dispute in Gaoqiao where rickshaw pullers disrupted public buses, the Public Security Bureau captured a large number of troublemakers. They were then released on bail by the rickshaw boss, who guaranteed that such incidents would not happen again. The Public Security Bureau, considering that they were first-time offenders, released them. According to the City Ferry Authority, this is a public security issue and the office is not involved. However, the current situation is quite quiet.</p>

<p>Approved by the Ministry of Railways and Can Be Implemented in the Near Future</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has been planning to lay double tracks on the Beijing-Shanghai railway line for many years due to the increasing development of railway services. However, it has been unable to implement this due to funding issues. Now, in order to facilitate train operations, the bureau has decided to lay double tracks on the Shanghai-Nanxiang section first. Xiao Weiguo, Director of the Traffic Department, has negotiated this with the Ministry of Railways and it has been settled. Construction will begin soon. In addition, passing loops will be laid between Zhengyi and Kunshan and between Gaozi and Zhenjiang, and passing sidings will be added to three or four small stations such as Bencao to accommodate more vehicles and facilitate transportation. According to Director Xiao, who spoke to the Shenshi News Agency reporter yesterday, the laying of double tracks between Shanghai North Station and Nanxiang is a matter of urgency, so it has been decided to lay them. The cost, including the addition of passing loops and sidings, will be approximately 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, which has been approved by the Ministry of Railways. This plan can be implemented in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Sand Barge Wrecked by Hurricane <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Gongyuanfa Copper Sand Suffers Disaster; Crew Members Fall into the Sea; Ship Collides; Haizhou Rescues and Sends to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Gongyuanfa sand barge, owned by Yishengyong in Qingdao, has been sailing to ports such as Yingkou, Dalian, and Andong, carrying passengers and goods. After unloading goods in Dalian this time, the ship was instructed to sail to Qingdao to load northern goods, grains, etc. valued at over 50,000 yuan. It sailed to Shanghai, and on the 17th of this month, after loading the goods, the shipowner, Mr. Wei, was ordered to set sail immediately. On the 21st, while sailing on the Copper Sand waters, it suddenly encountered a hurricane. The deck was struck by wind and waves, and three crew members working on the ship were swept into the sea. Wei and the crew were extremely alarmed and immediately lowered the sails. However, the wind was strong and the waves were high, and the ship was tossing and turning. They had no choice but to go with the wind. Unexpectedly, a huge gust of wind broke the main mast. At this point, the entire crew was even more panicked and cried for help. No ship passed by. Later, the ship was hit by waves and collided with the foot of the mountain at the north entrance of Copper Sand. The ship broke apart. When it ran aground, several more crew members fell off the ship. The ship immediately sounded the gong for help. Until dawn, a ship from Haizhou passed by and lowered its gangway, sailing to the foot of the mountain and rescuing the crew members to the ship. The ship then transported them to Haimen, where the ship's staff pooled 20 yuan and gave it to the shipowner, Wei. Yesterday, Wei and the rescued crew members took a ship to Shanghai and reported to the goods consignees. He also telegraphed the Qingdao consignees. It is said that there were a total of 31 people on the ship. Eighteen people have been rescued and arrived in Shanghai. Thirteen people were swept away by the wind and waves during the disaster. In the chaos at the time, it was difficult to take care of everyone. Although the ship ran aground at the foot of the mountain and the bottom and sides of the ship were broken, the inside of the ship was flooded. It is unknown whether the ship's cargo can be towed out of danger. The cargo consignees must go and inspect.</p>

<p>Suspected to Be a Man Who Planted Lotus Flowers After Being Assassinated; More Than a Dozen Knife Wounds</p>
<p>Around noon on the previous day, Kluff, a western patrol officer of the Customs Water Police, was patrolling the Suzhou Creek when he suddenly smelled a foul odor emanating from the water. He quickly shone a flashlight and saw a male corpse drifting downstream. The skin and flesh were gray-black and rotten. He pulled it up and examined it closely, finding that the corpse was naked and the clothes were completely decayed. There was still a rotten rope around the waist, and there were more than a dozen knife wounds all over the body. It was suspected that he had been assassinated and that a huge stone was tied to the corpse with a rope before it was sunk to the bottom of the river, what is known as "planting lotus flowers," in an attempt to cover up the crime. However, after the corpse was submerged for a long time, the rope gradually rotted, and the corpse broke free from the stone and floated to the surface. Therefore, it has been submerged in the river for several months. After the skin and flesh rotted, the face became blurred and unrecognizable, and it was difficult to estimate the age. The western patrol officer took the corpse to the police station and waited for the salvage bureau's patrol boat to take it to the bureau before reporting it for autopsy.</p>
<p>Arranging to See a Movie Leads to a Hotel; Claiming to Be Unmarried When He Has a Wife</p>
<p>Tang Dayuan, a woman from Pudong who lives on the upper floor of the Wanyuan Rice Store at No. 582 Kangti Road in the French Concession, is 23 years old this year. Recently, she has hired lawyers Wu Peng and Fang Junjie to represent her in filing a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District, accusing Zhu Zhuocai (from Chongming, 25 years old), the younger brother of Zhu Zhuoying, the owner of the Wanyuan New Rice Store, of deceiving her into having an abortion. The complaint states that the plaintiff lives with her mother and stepfather on the upper floor of the store. Zhuocai, the younger brother of the store owner, often came to the store, and Zhang, Zhuoying's wife, introduced them, saying that he was not yet married. On the afternoon of the ninth day of the twelfth lunar month of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, Zhuocai came and arranged to see a movie. The plaintiff believed him and went out with him. Unexpectedly, Zhuocai did not lead her to the cinema but forced her to the Yuebin Hotel on Fada Road, saying that they would wait a moment and then go to the movie. The plaintiff, unaware of anything unusual, followed him to Room 5, where she was raped three times. The plaintiff initially refused, but Zhuocai swore that he was not married and was willing to take her as his wife. After various deceptions and threats, she had to submit to his abuse. Who knew that she was secretly pregnant and her belly grew larger every day. She urged her sister-in-law to urge him to come and marry her, but initially, someone was sent to negotiate, and then the appointment was indefinitely postponed. On the third day of the fourth lunar month of this year, Zhang told the plaintiff to go, saying that her uncle already had a wife, and asked her to get an abortion pill from Yi Yiyuan to have an abortion to prevent people from knowing. The plaintiff brought the medicine back and was about to take it when her mother found out and interrogated her strictly, so she could only tell the truth. Her mother wanted to drive the plaintiff out, so someone ran to tell the plaintiff's aunt, who came home to persuade her. Later, Zhuocai asked Yuan to come and explain that 120 yuan would be paid as settlement, with 50 yuan paid first. The plaintiff's mother refused. On the twelfth day of the fourth lunar month, Yuan came again to pay 15 yuan, but the plaintiff's mother did not accept it, and she threw it down and left. Later, it was discovered that the abortion pill was purchased by Yuan on behalf of Zhang, who also used seductive words to incite her to go to Pudong for an abortion. The plaintiff did not agree. The first defendant, Zhu Zhuocai, committed Article 244 of the Criminal Law. The second and third defendants committed Article 307 of the Criminal Law, the crime of assisting in an attempted abortion. She requests that the court investigate and handle the matter according to the law. The court has approved the petition and summoned the defendants yesterday. Zhu Zhuocai and Yuan did not appear in court. Judge Xiong briefly questioned the plaintiff and ordered that the hearing be adjourned to summon the witnesses to the court for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Wounded Thief Arrested at Hospital <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Victim Identifies Him; Wife and Brother Detained for Visiting;</p>
<p>Qiu Guiyuan's home at No. 3 Yukang Lane, Oujia Road, was broken into by several bandits around 1:00 AM the day before yesterday. They used guns to threaten and silence them, robbing them of valuables worth 101.5 yuan. When they were about to escape, they engaged in a gunfight with Chinese and Western officers guarding the alley. One bandit was shot, but they still managed to escape. A stray bullet hit Yong Ren Zhong Qingyun and Jiang Bei Ren Xu Chongdao. Afterwards, the wounded thief Fu Ning entered Li Shoutang at Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. Wang Chengying, the Chinese detective of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, learned of this and went with the victim to identify Li as one of the robbers at the scene, so he sent detectives to guard him. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. A while later, Li's wife, Wang, and brother, Li Shoubai, went to the hospital to visit him and were arrested. A handgun with six bullets was found on the ground behind Zhang Chongxin Sauce Garden on Heller Road, where the thieves had discarded it while escaping. The house of Li at No. 3 Xieliji, Jinling Road, Zhabei, was searched, but no weapons were found. Three photos of Li and others were brought to the police station. The police chief ordered them to be detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court 3 of the First Special District Court. Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the Municipal Council, gave a detailed account of what happened and requested an adjournment to wait for Li to recover from his injuries before interrogation. The gun and photos were presented for inspection. According to Lin Sheng, the son of the victim Qiu Guiyuan, at that time, relatives and others were playing cards to pass the time when four bandits broke in, each holding a handgun, claiming to be "helping" and robbing the gold ring on Chen Zhou's hand, the cash on her body, and the silver coins on the table. One bandit said that he was a patrol officer and would shoot anyone who made a noise. The thief seeking treatment at the hospital was indeed one of the four thieves, and the two defendants in custody were not at the scene. According to Chen Zhou, who lived at No. 84 Tongzhou Road, she was playing cards at Qiu's house when she was robbed of two gold rings and 28 yuan in cash. The thief wearing a white cloth shirt and blue pants looked similar to one of the people in the photo, the Li in the hospital. When questioned, Li Wang said that Li Shoutang was her husband and that they had been married for many years and had two children. Her husband said he was shot by a Zhang on his way home and that she knew nothing about the robbery. Li Shoubai said that he heard that his brother had been shot at a certain number on Gonghe Road, Zhabei, and that he sent him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. He did not know that his brother was a robber. He asked the court for a clear understanding. Judge Wu Zehan adjourned the case for seven days to wait for the defendant Li Shoutang to recover from his injuries before further investigation. Li Wang and Li Shoubai were each released on bail of 500 yuan. If they could not provide bail, they would be remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Consuming Lysol and Orange Juice, Room Service Discovers Him and Rushes Him to the Hospital</p>
<p>A traveler, dressed in a Western suit and shirt, with yellow shorts, arrived at the Majestic Hotel on Avenue Edward VII the night before last. The hotel clerk led him to room 320. He registered as Zhang Zhenhua, 18 years old, from Shangyu. That evening, he only made one phone call and did not go out, retiring to his room. Yesterday morning around 11:00 AM, he got up, washed briefly, and ordered a bottle of orange juice from the tea server. He didn't ask for anything else and then closed the door. The tea server found his actions suspicious and became wary, secretly observing him. Soon after, the tea server noticed a strong chemical smell emanating from inside the room. Fearing an accident, he knocked on the door, but it was locked from the inside. They managed to open the door and found the young man lying stiffly on the bed, his face pale, and liquid running from his mouth. Upon closer inspection, a bottle of Lysol was found on the table in the room, with only a small amount of liquid remaining. There was also a cup containing half a cup of orange juice. Smelling it, they found it also contained Lysol. It was then realized that he had poured Lysol into the orange juice and drank it in an attempt to take his own life. The tea server immediately reported to the hotel clerk, who then reported to the police. He was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment in a taxi. Doctors at the hospital performed a gastric lavage, but it was not completely successful, and his condition remained critical. At the same time, police investigating the young man's background discovered that the name he had given was false. His real name was Jiang Yiquan, and his age and hometown were the same. He had previously worked as an employee of the Wah Cheng Tobacco Company's Ningbo branch and was currently unemployed. According to his friends, the reason for his suicide was likely due to financial difficulties and a hard life.</p>

<h3 id="e160">The Citizen Education Center Opens a Consumer Cooperative <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>To Distribute Goods Directly and Share Profits Among All Members</p>
<p>The Municipal Citizen Education Center, considering that citizens' daily necessities mostly rely on merchants who are bound to calculate profits and may not supply goods adequately, and that the oppression of the environment in terms of livelihood is most serious, while public awareness is scattered and lacks voluntary cooperative organizations, drafted simple rules for a consumer cooperative last month and submitted them to the Education Bureau for approval. Preparations began in mid-month, dividing it into one thousand shares at one yuan per share. Each member can subscribe to a maximum of one-tenth of the total amount, with one vote per person, not proportional to the number of shares, which is absolutely different from shareholders in a company. The direct distribution of goods and the sharing of profits among all members is the characteristic of the cooperative. Open accounts are merely a secondary matter. The full text of the simple rules is extracted below. If citizens are interested in joining, they can request a membership application form from the office.</p>
<p>Simple Rules of the Shanghai Municipal Citizen Education Center Consumer Cooperative (1) This center, in order to promote cooperative undertakings and facilitate citizens, organizes a consumer cooperative in accordance with cooperative methods, named the Shanghai Municipal Citizen Education Center Consumer Cooperative.

(6) The directors and supervisors are elected by the Members' Meeting, with a term of one year and eligible for re-election. (7) The Members' Meeting is held once every six months, and a quorum of more than half of all members must be present to hold the meeting. When necessary, the Board of Directors and Supervisors or a proposal from more than two-tenths of all members may convene an extraordinary meeting. (8) If a member is unable to attend the Members' Meeting due to circumstances, they may entrust an agent, but a sealed power of attorney is required for it to take effect. (9) Detailed rules for the Board of Directors and Supervisors shall be formulated separately and implemented after being approved by the Members' Meeting. (10) Dividends and net profits of the consumer cooperative will be distributed once at the end of each January and July. The distribution method is as follows: A. Annual interest on dividends is 5%. B. Net profit, after paying dividends and employee compensation, will be divided into ten parts.

<p>Must Greet Customers With A Pleasant Demeanor</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications announced: Regarding this announcement, it has been found that the installation of public telephones in various urban areas by this Bureau was originally intended to expedite communication and facilitate the public, in order to avoid barriers between merchants and travelers and to save time in contacting each other. The matter is indeed commendable. Managers of businesses with public telephones installed by this Bureau and managers of public telephone booths at various branch bureaus should greet people making calls with a pleasant demeanor and not be arrogant or conceited, which is displeasing to people. Except for special regulations, requests to make calls must be promptly connected and answered at any time within 24 hours, day and night. No excuses should be made to delay matters in order to comply with the Bureau's regulations. Both of the above points should be strictly observed. This is the most important thing. This is the announcement.</p>
<h3 id="e164">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Pays Attention to the Commercial Registration Law <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Soliciting Opinions from Various Industries</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to all executive and supervisory committee members and various industry associations to solicit opinions on the Commercial Registration Law. The letter stated: The chamber previously believed that Article 681 of the Civil Code, which stipulates joint and several liability for partnerships, was inconsistent with the commercial situation in our country. It requested the Legislative Yuan to amend it to be apportioned by shares. After years of debate, it was not approved. Although the Chamber had gathered opinions from various industries and proposed a separate method for registering partnerships and withdrawals, the Yuan believed that the partnership organization could be remedied by another Commercial Registration Law. There were also discussions by the Commercial Law and Civil Law Committees on drafting Commercial Registration Law regulations, but it has not been promulgated for a long time, making it difficult to implement the registration method proposed by the Chamber. In June of this year, the current session of the Members' Congress again resolved to request the Legislative Yuan to enact and implement the Commercial Registration Law as soon as possible. Before the law is promulgated, the opinions of merchant groups should be solicited as much as possible. On the 23rd of this month, the Commercial Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan replied, stating that the committee is currently drafting the Commercial Registration Law and needs to investigate the commercial conditions in various places for reference. Committee member Huang Youchang has been assigned to go to Shanghai to investigate. It is hoped that your Chamber will provide assistance and introductions. In addition to sending Mr. Huang a copy of the opinions of various industries on the case of joint and several liability for partnerships for reference, please express your high opinions on the Commercial Registration Law as much as possible. The letter should be submitted to the Chamber for review and forwarded for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Rickshaw Pullers' Representatives Petition the Shanghai Municipal Council <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the Recall of the Order to Register Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>Representatives of the rickshaw pullers, Wang Dexi, and others, petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating that the newly established regulations for rickshaw pullers are all impossible and difficult to accept, and requested a reconsideration to show genuine relief. The various impossible situations for the rickshaw pullers are hereby represented below: "Regarding the registration and licensing of rickshaw pullers," the new regulations require rickshaw pullers to be examined by a doctor to ensure that they are physically fit and deemed qualified before a license is issued. However, rickshaw pullers are all poor people, and their bodies lack nutrition. Not only are older rickshaw pullers unlikely to be deemed physically fit, but even younger rickshaw pullers will not easily qualify. It is undeniable that the reason they are able to pull rickshaws is that the wheels are pneumatic rubber tires and they are driven on flat asphalt roads, making it easy to do the work. If only strong and healthy rickshaw pullers are required, it is feared that there will be very few. This is the first impossibility. Moreover, those who make a living by pulling rickshaws in the concession are living in poverty, and their numbers are close to 80,000. The number of licenses the Rickshaw Affairs Association plans to issue is limited to 40,000. The remaining rickshaw pullers will inevitably be eliminated and will inevitably suffer from unemployment. It is asked where they will be placed. This is the second impossibility. Other things, such as the provision that rickshaw pullers' licenses cannot be transferred, is even more shocking. Rickshaw pullers come and go, and there is no fixed number. Even those who pull rickshaws all year round work in shifts of 12 hours each. During that time, they may lack the strength, so sons often help their fathers pull, and younger brothers replace older brothers to allow them to rest. This has become commonplace. If licenses are not allowed to be transferred, the rickshaw being pulled will have to be stopped immediately, and where will the car rental fee be paid from? This is the third impossibility. Moreover, in the event of violations or unruly behavior by rickshaw pullers, the rickshaw owner and foreman are responsible, and the police and courts are responsible for punishment. It has been followed to this day, and there is no need for new regulations for registration and licensing. It has been found that there are 10,000 public rickshaws in the concession, and according to the rental regulations, there are 60 shifts per day and night, and each shift works less than 12 hours. A rickshaw puller cannot work more than 13 or 14 shifts per month at most. If a rickshaw puller is strong, they can pull for a maximum of 9 or 10 hours and cannot pull any longer. For the remaining hours, some physically unsound rickshaw pullers buy 2 or 3 hours from the full-shift rickshaw puller, called pulling the rickshaw's rear and a corner of the night. This is how the physically challenged rickshaw pullers make a living. It is estimated that there are 20,000 to 30,000 people, and including the rickshaw pullers on the full shift, there are indeed 70,000 to 80,000 people. Your bureau's regulations stipulate that only 40,000 rickshaw pullers can be registered. If the number of rickshaw pullers who fail to register exceeds 40,000, there are also rickshaw pullers' wives or one or two children under budget, and the actual number is more than 100,000 poor people, who all rely on pulling rickshaws to make a living. They have always been law-abiding, selling their labor, sparing no effort, and struggling to make a living. Fortunately, your bureau sympathized with their situation and established a Rickshaw Committee, 口口聲聲均以救濟車夫爲前提, One says to raise the position, and the other says to improve the life.

<p>The Xinwei Relief Association Raises Funds for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Public Association sent a letter to the Xinwei Relief Association, stating that according to Haiyan citizens Zhang Shizhen, Fu Shouhong, Zhu Futing, Chen Yilu, and Xu Zhaoheng, and others, Haiyan has suffered from wind, insect, water, and drought disasters since 1924. Private storage has been emptied, and the silk cocoon crop has been disastrous for years, and the rural economy is becoming more and more collapsed. Since the summer of this year, it has not rained for a long time, and the farmland is irrigated day and night. The water source is exhausted, and the seedlings that have been planted are scorched by the scorching sun and die. At the same time, food prices have soared, and it is difficult to fill the stomach. In this situation, not only is the autumn harvest hopeless, but even self-sufficiency is difficult to maintain. In the past five or six days, villagers have been crying for help at the gate of the county government, and thousands and tens of thousands of people have been weeping, and suicides have been heard from time to time. Seeing this, it is very sad. Although efforts have been made to distribute accumulated grain, but the number is limited, and it is difficult to fill the stomach. Except for the citizens and others directly requesting your association to allocate a huge amount of money to provide disaster relief, so that hundreds of thousands of victims in the country will not be displaced and become starved, and also ask for our association to unite. After checking the county, it is located on the high coast and has a shortage of water. The drought situation is more serious than other places.益以閭閻元氣久竭, Rice prices are rising day by day, and farmers are begging to drink water until they want to be full, and although the county officials and gentlemen have been trying to organize emergency relief, the county is known for its poverty, and public and private places are in the same difficult situation. As for Yuwai Guicai, there will definitely be plans to raise funds to help the disasters that are near to disaster. The association is worried about Sangzi, and is too exhausted.合亟代陳, To invite pity, all pray for the cut, This is to give the Xinwei Relief Association, Shanghai All-Zhejiang Public Association Chairman Director Chu Fucheng, July 23rd.</p>
<h3 id="e167">The Technicians of the Commodity Inspection Bureau Invent Intestine Casing Bleaching Powder <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection and Production Group of the Ministry of Industry, in view of the fact that there are many intestine casing manufacturers in this port, and the number of products exported to foreign countries every year is very large, occupying a considerable position in international trade, but most of them stick to the old methods and do not do research. When there are preliminary problems, the follow-up is not good, and the animal intestines change color and cannot be saved. It is a pity that the valuable animal intestines are turned into useless waste. Not only does the factory's output decrease and money is lost, but it also has an impact on the country's international trade. Chen Jun Zilong, the intestine casing inspection technician of the group, worked hard during his spare time to study and try various chemical drugs in order to restore them to their original state, export them to foreign countries, increase the country's economic income, and eliminate unnecessary losses to merchants and factories. For more than half a year, it has been slightly effective. Later, with the guidance of Chen Shunyun, the director of the group, two kinds of intestinal casing bleaching powder were invented, one is intestinal casing bleaching liquid, and the other is intestinal casing bleaching powder. When the color of the intestinal casing is not good, you can use bleaching liquid to bleach it. If you are still not satisfied, add a little bleaching powder to it, and it will make it as fresh as intestinal casing. However, the tissue of the bleached intestinal casing is not damaged at all. This kind of medicine not only has the effect of bleaching intestinal casing, but also has the ability to prevent corrosion and disinfect, and has no hindrance to our health. It is no more than the intestinal casing made without this kind of medicine. Chen Jun Zilong has gone to various factories to test it, and the results are excellent. It is now heard that the bureau plans to report the situation to the Ministry of Industry and give it a patent.</p>

<p>丨丨Answer to Mr. Zhu Ming 丨丨</p>
<p>Ritual rainseeking is a superstitious act, which is something everyone with common sense knows. In today's world where science has developed to a high degree, superstitious acts are clearly a major obstacle to social progress, and those who support superstition clearly have a numbing effect. On the one hand, we have clearly seen that scientists around the world can use scientific methods to reliably create artificial rain, while on the other hand, we spend a lot of money and manpower to make useless prayers. This is really a strange thing in the world today!</p>
<p>Superstitious behavior is a custom among backward people and has a long and deeply rooted history. Rainseeking is one of these customs. The livelihood of the people depends entirely on farming, and the success of farming depends on the appropriate amount of rainfall. Rainfall is a matter of life and death for the people. In the feudal era when science was unknown, people did not understand how rainfall occurred and had to explain it with divine power. When rainfall did not occur for a long time, they used rainseeking rituals to flatter the gods they imagined. This was inevitable in the society of many years ago. However, after the rise of science, people can no longer entrust their fate to the will of ghosts and gods, but gradually learn to conquer nature themselves, so that everything in nature can benefit human life. Therefore, with the development of capitalism and the progress of science, superstitious behavior has gradually disappeared in human society. For example, in China, after the May Fourth Movement, some people gradually realized the importance of science and stood up to oppose superstition and theocracy. However, in recent years, especially this year, superstitious behavior has suddenly been promoted very universally. First, the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly was a big commotion, followed by the discovery of the scientific spirit planchette diagram, and recently the rainseeking, where living Buddhas, heavenly masters, and Catholics were all mobilized, almost making people suspect that they were born hundreds of years ago. Why is this? Is science really not working?</p>
<p>In fact, this matter is not accidental. Our current surroundings are not only full of the restoration movement of superstitious behavior, but also thickly filled with a nostalgic atmosphere. In schools, classical Chinese has replaced vernacular Chinese, and in social life, the teachings in the Four Books and Five Classics have been promoted again. Obviously, someone is trying to pull the people back to the living state of two thousand years ago. Under such circumstances, when drought is about to form, another superstitious behavior of rainseeking is inevitable. Therefore, although it is clear that the behavior of rainseeking is so boring, not only is there no opposition, but some people are vigorously promoting it, which is also one of the manifestations of using old customs to thicken the nostalgic atmosphere.

<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Shih said in his "Essays on Experimentation" that "success has always come from experimentation." Although Dr. Hu Shih has now lost his position as a mentor to young people, the saying "success has always come from experimentation" is always worth savoring.</p>
<p>The spirit of "experimentation" is the spirit of the "May Fourth" Movement. The youth of China today must always have the spirit of "experimentation."</p>
<p>During the "May Fourth" era, progressive intellectuals opposed feudal classical Chinese and advocated vernacular Chinese. So they tried to create vernacular literature and brought out their own vernacular works. This practice of producing vernacular works was a good weapon for overthrowing classical Chinese. However, as the "May Fourth" tide subsided, the tendency of vernacular Chinese to become classical Chinese became increasingly developed.</p>
<p>The tendency of vernacular Chinese to become classical Chinese is a revival of the spirit of the late Ming Dynasty. This spirit has directly created the current "Yuan Zhonglangism" literature. This "Yuan Zhonglangism" is, of course, a literati literature. It is a disguised classical Chinese literature. It is probably in response to this "Zhonglangism" trend, and its brothers' trends, that the mass language literature movement was produced.</p>
<p>I have never expressed an opinion on mass language literature. But in the future society, there will definitely be the emergence of mass language literature, which is beyond doubt. However, in the current environment, there are quite a few difficulties in establishing mass language.</p>
<p>For the establishment of mass language literature, the environmental issue is a prerequisite. And the mass language of the future may be a kind of "scientific national language." Mass language should be comprehensive, not separate. And in China, it is necessary to produce a unified mass language. Naturally, there are exceptions for the Miao and Man peoples.</p>
<p>The proposal of the mass language issue is meaningful. However, up to now, the theory is still very conceptual and very vague. In order to help with this, I think everyone should work hard to practice the production of mass language literature. Naturally, there will be shortcomings and difficulties in the practice of production. However, the practice of production can allow us to encounter various problems and enable mass language theory to be further developed. And only the practice of production can prove the correctness or error of the theory. The production of mass language literature is the goal. Simply talking about theory is not enough.</p>
<p>Yesterday, an old friend said to me: "During the 'May Fourth' era, we opposed classical Chinese and advocated vernacular Chinese, and the articles opposing classical Chinese were written in vernacular Chinese. However, now the promoters of mass language advocate mass language, but no one is writing in mass language." I think this is a sincere piece of advice to the promoters of mass language.</p>
<p>In the discussion of the mass language issue, the most important thing is to bring out the works of mass language. And the discussion articles should preferably be written in mass language. It is necessary to bring out the model of mass language text. "Success has always come from experimentation." Only the experimental practice of production can make mass language writing successful.</p>

<p>— Kang Bodu</p>
<p>Another strong force attacking vernacular Chinese is Mr. Lin Yutang. What he attacks is not the "difficult to understand" vernacular Chinese, but the "Luli Lusu" vernacular Chinese. He does not even have the idea of Mr. Liu wanting vernacular Chinese to "return to simplicity and truth." To express meaning, only the "analects style" (vernacular Chinese of classical Chinese) will do.</p>
<p>When Mr. Lin appeared armed with vernacular Chinese, the struggle between classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese had already passed. Unlike Mr. Liu, who is a survivor of the melee, he inevitably has a sense of nostalgia and laments the decline of the genre. It is very natural for him to flash and place the Song and Ming Analects under the banner of "humor."</p>
<p>This "humor" is the "How to Write a Note" in the 45th issue of "The Analects." Because he wanted to ask a carpenter for some putty, he wrote a note in the analects style, but he was afraid that others would say that he "opposed vernacular Chinese," so he rewrote it in vernacular Chinese, selected style, and Tongcheng school, but all were ridiculous. In the end, he asked the "pageboy" to pass the message and asked the carpenter for putty.</p>
<p>"The Analects" is a popular publication, so I will not bother to copy it here. In short, the only one that is not ridiculous is the analects style one. The other three are all unacceptable. But the replacement of these four different roles is actually played by Mr. Lin himself. One is the leading man, which is the "analects style," and the other three are clowns who make faces and act strangely, making the leading man look extraordinary.</p>
<p>But this is no longer "humor," but "jesting," which is no different from the street tactics of drawing a turtle on the wall and writing the name of the person he hates on its back. However, those who see it often laugh at the person who is drawn without asking right or wrong.</p>
<p>"Humor" or "jesting" must produce results, unless you know what it means and just treat it as a "joke."</p>
<p>Because the facts may not be as good as the article. For example, this analects-style note has never been completely cut off in China. If you have time, you might as well go to the alleys of Shanghai. Sometimes you will see a stall with a scholar sitting there, writing letters for male and female workers. The writing he uses is definitely not as easy to understand as the note drafted by Mr. Lin, but it is clearly "analects style." This is the end of the analects school that is being revived now, but no one has painted his nose white.</p>
<p>This is a concrete "humor."</p>
<p>But it is really difficult to appreciate "humor." I once proved the rationality of spanking in China from physiology: if the buttocks were born for excretion or sitting, they would not need to be so big. The soles of the feet should be much smaller, wouldn't they be enough to support the whole body? We don't eat people anymore, and we don't need so much meat. So, it can be seen that it is specially for spanking. Sometimes I tell people, and they generally think it is "humor." But if someone has been spanked, or has been spanked himself, I think the feeling would probably not be like this.</p>
<p>There is no way, when everyone is not comfortable, I am afraid that it will eventually be said that "China has no humor."</p>
<h3 id="e185">How to Write a Note <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yutang was installing screens at his home, and the edges were not properly sealed, leaving small gaps. He wanted to write a note to ask for some putty to patch the holes. "At first, he wrote it naturally, which is vernacular Chinese of classical Chinese. Later, he was afraid that people would see it and object, so he changed it to classical Chinese of vernacular Chinese. But then he was afraid that the carpenter would not understand it, which would lose the meaning of 'mass language.' Later, the more he changed it, the more confused he became. He inadvertently wrote a piece of four-six that seemed to make sense but didn't. He felt dissatisfied, so he learned from Han Yu and revived the decline of the Eight Dynasties, writing ancient prose of the Three Dynasties. But he felt that the words 'putty' were not elegant enough, so he gave up halfway." (My Words in the 45th issue of The Analects) This is Mr. Lin's joking style, with the meaning beyond the words, and we understand each other without speaking.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin drafted four kinds of notes. The parallel prose is not satisfactory, and the one learning from Han is also a bit of a donkey. The "classical Chinese of vernacular Chinese" is deliberately written in a twisted and unnatural way. Now let's discuss what Mr. Lin calls the "natural writing method." Mr. Lin's original note is as follows: "XX Baohao. The screen you installed the other day has gaps along the edges, so mosquitoes can get in. Catch one when it comes, and another comes again, making it impossible to sit during the day and sleep at night, which is very painful. I am sending someone to ask for a little putty to repair it. I hope you will not value putty and take credit lightly. XX Qizhi"</p>
<p>In my opinion, this note is not a natural writing method. The purpose of this note is to get a little putty. You don't need to say any reason, or even if you want to say a reason, it is enough to say that there are gaps in the window edges. The issue of mosquitoes coming in and out does not seem to need to be mentioned. (If this note were written to a lover, that would be another matter. Perhaps the lover would feel a little distressed after seeing the mosquitoes biting and would quickly buy putty and send it over, which is also possible.)</p>
<p>Now, let me try it:</p>
<p>(A) Classical Chinese Style</p>
<p>The screen installed the other day still has cracks along the edges. Send someone to get putty and please give a little. Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>XX BaohaoXXX</p>
<p>(B) Vernacular Style</p>
<p>That day, the screen you installed for me had leaks on the edges. I am sending someone to the store to get some putty. Please wrap a little for him to bring back!</p>
<p>XX BaohaoXXX</p>
<p>Mr. Lin's final solution was to have Ah Jing pass the message verbally. I think Ah Jing must have had the following conversation when he went to the store to ask for putty:</p>
<p>"Ah Jing": Boss, Mr. Lin asked me to get some putty.</p>
<p>Boss: What do you need it for?</p>
<p>Ah Jing: The screen you installed for us the other day had leaks on the edges!</p>
<p>Boss: Clerk! Wrap a little putty and give it to him to take back!"</p>
<p>Okay, my note and what Ah Jing said verbally are consistent. Mr. Lin, let's give up that "vernacular Chinese of classical Chinese" and write honest mass language!</p>

<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>I once spent a delightful summer in a farmer's house at Sītáng Bridge in Bǎoshān. Now, recalling it, that rural village, encircled by a small river and surrounded by green trees, suddenly brings forth a chorus of cicadas and unfolds before my eyes, as if I have returned to that place of past visits.</p>
<p>That elderly landlord, is he still, at midday, holding a child, dragging his swollen feet afflicted by dampness, slowly walking to the hibiscus hedge, wrinkling his forehead as he gazes for a while at the sun-scorched fields, and then silently returning, sitting under the jujube tree shade, listlessly fanning himself with a cattail fan, allowing flies to leisurely stroll across his face? I hope he is still like that, because in my heart I can't help but think that at his age, with those ailing feet, perhaps during the January 28th Incident, he was hit by a small bullet and fell into the stream.</p>
<p>His wife, a talkative old woman, should still be alive and well, often returning from the cotton fields, her head covered in sweat. As soon as she enters the wicker gate with one or two sunflowers drooping over it, she calls out, and the white chickens and mottled chickens, responding to her call, gather around her like a group of children, stretching their long necks. Her blue cloth apron, which holds something, suddenly opens, and various tender green grasses are scattered on the bodies and necks of the chickens. At the same time, she quickly hides as if escaping something, her eyes swiftly noticing something else.</p>
<p>"Oh dear, the pig has run out again!"</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>"How can you dry things like that? The clothes have been blown onto the muddy ground."</p>
<p>Whenever she comes back, the house and veranda are filled with her energetic voice. Sitting by the window reading or writing, I am often tempted to look up and walk out of the quiet and leisurely little house to share her joy in busyness. Because when one is idle, one envies those who are working.</p>
<p>Every day, when I tire of reading, I stand up, stretch my waist, and raise my wrists. The green cotton fields dotted with women in white headscarves, beyond the fence, come to the window along with the clear breeze. If her two sons were also working in the cotton fields, I would have thrown my books on the table, kicked off my wooden clogs in the corner, and run barefoot to weed with them. Because in the fields there were also her young daughter-in-law and daughter, who, in a Chinese society like this, should be avoided.</p>
<p>Her two sons never went to the cotton fields to weed (as if weeding was something only women did). They only did other things, sometimes sleeping for half a day, and after waking up, they would lazily sit on the earthen steps, twisting their mouths and leisurely smoking cigarettes. At first, seeing the women so busy, sweating under the scorching sun, and then having to come home to cook and take care of the children while eating, I simply felt disgusted with them: why are men so lazy? Later, bothered by the swarms of mosquitoes, I went to the fields at night and found them working hard night fishing by the receding river. Then I felt deeply ashamed, because in the village, the truly lazy one, I should admit, was myself.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Art of Name-Spreading <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Dūn Páng</p>
<p>Anecdotes from the Literary World of the Qing Dynasty, No. 5</p>
<p>Chá Xiàzhòng, Jiāng Xīmíng, Táng Dōngjiāng, Tāng Xīyá, Gōng Shùtáng, Shǐ Jiāoyǐn, gathered in the capital for literary and wine gatherings. They once said that if each of them published their own collections in the future, whether they would be remembered or not was uncertain. The only way to ensure remembrance was to weave each other's names into their collections. A hundred years later, if one of them was remembered, all would be remembered. This is how scholars, with their fondness for fame, clung to their habits.</p>
<p>Note: Scholars have a fondness for fame, and there are many ways to seek it. However, rather than writing an autobiography or recording how many times one played cards or drank with Ms. Lú Yǐn, or using a pseudonym to write a critique praising one's own novels, it is better to find a way to weave one's name into the writings of others. An autobiography is good, but it may not be remembered. Articles about Lú Yǐn and critiques by pseudonymous critics may also not be remembered. But if a writer who is likely to be remembered is willing to include my name in his writings, then even if I am criticized, my name will certainly be passed down. Therefore, recently, a writer published an open letter in his publication to another writer, provoking him, but in the end said, "If the gentleman feels this letter is worth responding to, please send it to the editor at XXXXX for publication. Otherwise, I hope the gentleman will write a serious critique of me. I think any publication would welcome it."</p>
<p>Further Note: When I read "Qing Dynasty Unofficial History Grand View," I always note that it was borrowed from Mr. Cáo Jùrén, also to give Mr. Cáo another chance to be remembered, if my writing can be remembered. But I wonder if Mr. Cáo would be willing to mention my humble name in his articles, saying that he once lent me books?</p>
<h3 id="e188">I Come From the East (7) <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Xīngyě</p>
<p>West of Rocky Mountain, all that passed were beautiful fields. Within the Columbia River basin, the wheat fields are comparable to the Snake River basin in the western United States. What impressed and admired me most here was their irrigation system. For example, the hometown of Senator Borah, Boise City, was originally barren land, but now the man-made canals have encircled this small city. Green grass grows on both sides of the canals, covering the ground peacefully like a carpet. To call this a city is not as accurate as calling it an extremely hygienic park. Who would know that before irrigation, this place was a desolate, yellow wasteland? I admire the greatness of material science because it has allowed mankind to have such beautiful places. Great material science, it can create heaven for mankind from hell.</p>
<p>Creating heaven from hell is the continuous pursuit of progressive peoples. In terms of material construction, Americans certainly have this ability and spirit. The American West was developed later, but many construction projects have already surpassed the older East. They have maintained the courage, adventurousness, and recklessness left by the Red Indians, accumulated more than a hundred years of hard work and endurance, and used the latest scientific inventions to transform their material environment. I envy them, I am jealous of them, and I hope that the Chinese nation on the other side of the Pacific also has the same spirit and the same effort!</p>
<p>Canada—England? America?</p>
<p>Five days of driving took me from the Atlantic coast in the far east of the United States to the Pacific coast in the far west. On a rainy morning, I arrived in Seattle, which I had not seen for three years. That is the northwesternmost corner of the United States. A journey of more than three thousand miles had disappeared behind my feet. I saw the Pacific Ocean, looking west in the setting sun toward what I usually thought was where the sun set. It seemed that my motherland was not far away. I seemed to see the shadows of the mountains and fields of China on the opposite horizon.</p>
<p>In this corner of the Pacific, three large cities are cleverly arranged. If the Pacific is the night sky, they are three stars in the sky. Seattle is the one to the south, across the Strait of Georgia to the north, the lively Vancouver to the east, and the beautiful Victoria City to the west. Within twenty-four hours a day, trains, planes, and ships are constantly circling between these cities, connecting these three small stars into a ring. The people living inside the ring are closely related in their lives. However, irrational political boundaries have placed these three cities under two different flags.</p>

<p>The Ministry recently clarified two matters regarding the interpretation of elementary school regulations. (1) According to the Education Department of Shanxi Province, Article 101 of the Elementary School Regulations states that each province may designate provincial elementary schools or provincial normal schools affiliated with elementary schools within the provincial district as the central elementary school of the district. The term "district" in "provincial district" refers to whether a county is a district, or whether several counties are a district, and whether the entire province can be divided into several districts. The instruction to the department was that the term "district" in "provincial district" refers to several counties. As for how many districts the entire province should be divided into, the department should determine the number of districts based on the actual situation of school establishment in the province and convenience of research. (2) According to the Education Department of Gansu Province, an interpretation of Article 4 of the Elementary School Law and Article 11 of the Elementary School Regulations was requested (it is easy to regulate the names of elementary schools in townships, but the areas within the county seats of Gansu are smaller, and the place names are no more than a certain street or alley, which is far less complicated than the names in the county seats of the southeastern provinces. If public elementary schools below the county and city level are named after place names in smaller areas without adding the word "county seat", it seems that you are explicit. Take an example, such as the location of the No. 1 Elementary School in Gaolan County, now the No. 1 District of Caojia Lane in Gaolan County, and the funding is from the county government. According to the above sections, what should the school name be to be appropriate? ). The instruction to the department was that, according to Article 11 of the Elementary School Regulations, which stipulates that public elementary schools below the county and city level should be named after place names in smaller areas, the No. 1 Elementary School in Gaolan County should be renamed as Caojia Lane Elementary School, Gaolan County. Other county town area elementary schools that need to be renamed in similar situations should also be renamed by analogy.</p>

<p>Winning Only Ten to Five Against the Inside and Outside Factories Does Not Compensate for the Facts</p>
<p>French Business Heavily Defeats Japan Fourteen to One to Win the Championship</p>
<p>The key to winning or losing the Lawn Tennis League between Zhonghua and French Business depended on the final battle yesterday. Zhonghua was one point behind French Business. In yesterday's battle against the Inside and Outside Cotton Mill, they had the ambition to win fifteen to zero to win the championship. How could they know that things would not go as planned? As a result, they only won ten to five, while French Business heavily defeated the Japanese Association fourteen to one. The championship was won by French Business. In total, Zhonghua won all seven matches. Although French Business lost to Zhonghua six to nine, Zhonghua's total score was less than that of French Business. The championship was given away. It is a pity. The results of the four matches yesterday are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday's Situation</p>
<p>In the battle between Zhonghua and the Inside and Outside Factory, Ma Anquan and Guo Yujie in the fourth group lost three games in a row. Their performance was completely uncertain. They were just playing casually and did not strengthen their fighting spirit because of the strength of their opponents. The opponent's Tsukiji is a famous player of the Japanese community. His skills are only second to that of Machida. They took the easy way out and degraded themselves. Zhonghua fell for their trick. It was a fatal injury. Wang Wenzheng and Yu Tianguang in the third group won the first game six to two, but lost the second game six to eight, and then won the final game six to zero. The loss of the second game was due to carelessness. In the third game of the first group, the opponent used an extremely good high ball to embarrass the enemy. Lin Zhengchang's long shot was ineffective and he lost. He also lost one point. The second and fifth groups both won all the games, resulting in ten to five.</p>

<p>A Contribution</p>
<h3 id="e229">The Spirit of Loving National Goods <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>I once said: "The degree to which people love national goods is less in large commercial ports than in inland cities, and even less in inland cities than in poor and remote rural areas." My trip to Nanchang this time has made me even more convinced that this statement is not wrong. Nanchang is an inland city, with transportation from Jiujiang via the Nanxun Railway, which can be reached in half a day. Motor vehicles on highways are even more accessible in all directions. Since the Unofficial Transport Commission and Chairman Chiang’s camp stationed there recently, vigorously carrying out the New Life Movement and actively advocating a simple life, the people of Nanchang are all striving to use domestic products. Recently, the sales of foreign goods have been decreasing day by day. Taking foreign piece goods as an example, the annual sales were one million yuan three years ago, but now it is less than two million yuan. In addition, the sales of imported goods, according to Jiangxi merchants, account for only one-third of what they were two or three years ago. In the future, as the effects of the New Life Movement increase day by day, the sales of foreign goods will decrease day by day. This news is truly gratifying. After I arrived in Nanchang, I talked with Mr. Cai Shenzhai, the president of the Bank of China, and learned that the Nanchang business community now has a kind of ambition: to sell domestic products as much as possible whenever domestic products can be used. This spirit of courageously loving the country and being happy to sacrifice is even more worthy of emulation by Shanghai merchants. I also had the honor of being introduced by Mr. Cai to talk with various business leaders. Everyone expressed good feelings about the great progress made by Shanghai's national goods factories in recent years, and they are extremely willing to do their best to promote and cooperate with each other. At present, they plan to organize a national goods company to cooperate with the Shanghai production industry in actual production and sales. In the near future, it will not be difficult to realize a purely Chinese national goods company. Those who join are all leaders in the financial and industrial and commercial circles, as well as well-established merchants, and they have even gained local trust. This spirit of loving national goods is truly worthy of praise and admiration.</p>
<p>Talks on National Loans</p>
<h3 id="e230">Foreign Goods Lead to National Ruin <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Yiyi Mansion Owner</p>
<p>To say that "foreign goods lead to national ruin," we must first talk about "national goods saving the country."</p>
<p>We know that "national goods saving the country" has been shouted for a long time. However, to this day, the "foreign goods" on the market are still everywhere. The effectiveness of "national goods saving the country" is really equal to zero! Although people of insight designated last year as "National Goods Year" and this year as "Women's National Goods Year," the "National Goods Year" of last year resulted in a complete mess. As for this year's "Women's National Goods Year," twelve months have already passed six months. In these six months, how has "national goods saving the country" performed? According to the newspapers, it is: "Imports exceed exports" are increasing without decrease, especially the "cosmetics" needed by women every day, the amount is astonishing! Alas! In this situation, I feel that it is better to say frankly and honestly, "foreign goods lead to national ruin," rather than saying "national goods save the country" and just making foreigners laugh.</p>
<p>Or, it may be said: "National goods saving the country" is, in fact, the opposite of "foreign goods leading to national ruin." Because "foreign goods" can "lead to national ruin," that's why we need "national goods" to "save the country."</p>
<p>I say, "Although what you say is not bad, on the one hand, we keep shouting 'national goods saving the country,' while on the other hand, we keep maintaining an inextricable relationship with 'foreign goods.' If this contradictory strange phenomenon continues without reform, then there will eventually be a day of national ruin! May I ask, will this kind of national ruin be 'national goods saving the country,' or will it be 'foreign goods leading to national ruin?'"</p>
<h3 id="e231">Stores Should Use National Goods for Gifts Across the Board <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Jianping</p>
<p>Using gifts to compete for business is indeed a very effective and harmless method in business ethics. However, at a time when the whole country is shouting itself hoarse and calling for the promotion of national goods, everyone should use complete national goods as gifts across the board. Otherwise, it will inevitably lead to criticism and ridicule.</p>
<p>Recently, a certain silk store, in order to give preferential treatment to its customers, gave away XX brand orange soda from X country. This was originally nothing to be surprised about, but I don't know why they had to abandon the cheap and high-quality domestic products and willingly pay a very expensive price to expand business and widely promote for foreign merchants? Is it possible that there are no high-quality orange sodas among domestic products?</p>
<p>Originally, China has suffered to the point where no citizen can tolerate harboring jealousy anymore; and the industrial and commercial circles should especially work together with one heart and one mind, complementing each other. The price of goods supplied by manufacturers to stores as gifts should be even cheaper than ordinary wholesale prices; because stores are directly attracting their own customers, and indirectly they are helping the manufacturers of the gifts to spread the effect of advertising.</p>
<p>Alas! Honest managers! The situation no longer allows you to sit idly by. Hurry up and cooperate!</p>
<p>Alas! In short, I hope that this year's "Women's National Goods Year" will not be as bad as last year's "National Goods Year"! I urge everyone to work hard and promote "national goods" to overthrow "foreign goods," so that "foreign goods leading to national ruin" will not really become a reality. That would truly be an immeasurable good deed!</p>
<h3 id="e232">It is Especially Appropriate to Promote National Goods in Cities <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Promoting national goods has been noisy for quite some time. Is it effective? The customs statistics show that foreign goods are constantly increasing. Is it ineffective? Several national goods companies' business is not declining, which is confusing. In fact, people who love national goods have become a little more enthusiastic because of the promotion. As for some people who are still desperately promoting foreign goods, no matter how much you talk until your tongue is parched and your lips are dry, they remain unmoved. I can use a literary saying to describe these people: "Shu Bao has no conscience at all." Now there are many people who advocate promoting national goods, starting with the countryside first. That's right! I also thought of this point. Because the area of ​​the entire China is mostly rural. As long as all national goods are used in the countryside, even if foreign goods are still used in the bustling cities, the number will be limited. More than ten years ago, I followed a few enthusiastic gentlemen and brought many domestic goods to the inland areas to travel and persuade people. Many villagers only bought a little after listening to your persuasion. They were perfunctory to your face; it can also be said that they bought some cheap goods because they were half-given and half-sold, so the result was a failure. Because of this, my thinking changed. Promoting in the countryside is indeed necessary, but the heavier work should be applied to the cities, because what is loved in the cities will be imitated by the towns and villages. "The city girls wear high buns, and the countryside follows suit by one foot." This sentence is really true.</p>
<p>The three things that people cannot live without are of course "clothing," "food," and "use." First, let's take the clothes people wear: people in Europe and America take the styles of Paris as the standard. Whatever is fashionable in Paris, other places will follow and imitate. In China, of course, it is Shanghai. What is popular in Shanghai gradually spreads to Suzhou and Hangzhou, and even to remote rural areas. If the fashionable women in the city, no matter how new the patterns are, use domestic fabrics, the people in the inland and rural areas will not need to be persuaded at this time, they will naturally follow the trend. In addition, what about the food and things people use? Isn't it all the same?</p>
<p>People in the cities! You are the teachers and role models for the people of the whole country. If you love national goods, the people of the whole country will also rise up and love them. If you love foreign goods and insist that the people in the inland areas only use national goods, that is impossible, and it is also unreasonable!</p>
<p>New News in the National Goods Industry This Week</p>
<p>(1) News from the International Trade Bureau: Tung oil is a special product of our country, and a large amount is exported to Japan every year. In order to prevent this import, the Governor-General of Korea has decided to reward the planting of tung trees. Trial planting has already been carried out on Jeju Island in South Korea, with planned and organized cultivation. Our tung oil market will inevitably be in danger of being taken away in the future, and the people of the country should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>(2) Shao Lizhi, Chairman of Shaanxi Province, and Yang Hucheng, Director of Pacification, initiated the preparation of the Xi'an National Goods Company. Mr. Du Chongyuan was specially invited from Shanghai to go west to prepare everything. It was recently reported that the company can be established immediately.</p>
<p>(3) Two years ago, Tan Changkai succeeded in testing and experimenting with a coal gas car during his tenure as the Director of the Hunan Construction Department. Now, the highway from Changsha to Xiangtan is specially used for coal gas cars. Since Yu Jichuan succeeded him as the director, he has continued to study alcohol cars that use alcohol instead of gasoline. Experts are currently preparing to manufacture several cars before the China Economic Society holds a meeting in Changsha in August to entertain people and show the achievements of Hunan's construction. It is heard that after the car is successfully made, all highways in Hunan Province can be exclusively used for coal gas and alcohol cars, and there is no need to use gasoline anymore.</p>
<p>(4) Mr. Qian Chengxu of the China General Federation of Industry recently sent a letter from Switzerland, describing the advantages of visiting four major factories in that country, pointing out the drawbacks of China's industry, and advocating that Chinese factories should first start with tidying up commodities, and then plan to expand.</p>
<p>(5) The China Industrial Products Export Company, organized by the Chinese and American business circles in this city, has specially collected a total of one hundred and fifty sheng from various factories in order to promote our country's goods abroad, and openly displayed them, inviting all circles to visit, and will send personnel to various ports in Nanyang on the 18th to carry out promotion.</p>
<p>(6) The Zhenjiang Provincial National Exhibition has already opened yesterday (the 25th). More than 120 companies from this city participated. The representatives attending, such as Liu Zhongying, etc., led by the China National Product Manufacturers Association, went to Zhenjiang early in the morning of the 22nd and frequently issued declarations.</p>
<p>(7) The Shanghai Machinery Federation recently sent letters to hotels and restaurants in various provinces and cities across the country and various national goods groups, requesting them to hang national goods specimens so that travelers can follow the pictures and ask for them, and also attached a book of national goods samples.</p>

<h3 id="e234">More on the National Goods Showcase Competition <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Hong</p>
<p>Before criticizing this Chenshe display of the Peide Tie Company, please first talk about the two methods of showing neckties.</p>
<p>The narrow neckties are placed in the entire showcase, requiring beauty that can attract the eye; they must be gathered together. After gathering, it is more stimulating, it can attract the line of sight of people who pass by where it is placed. It can attract the advertiser's harvest advertising effect. So the design of showcasing neckties is originally not easy. If you use pure straight lines or the two-pronged method of straight and curved lines to display neckties, it seems more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>In the showcase of the National Goods Display Showcase Competition held by the Huamei Tobacco Company, the Peide Tie Company does not seem to have noticed the wonderful patterns that can be formed from the neckties themselves, nor did they notice the combination of colors and patterns. This is really a very pity. Their showcase focuses on the amount and trademarks, so the concentration of stimulation depends entirely on the two neckties hanging under the heads of the two Western movie stars, Laurel and Hardy, as the main body of the entire showcase. Of course, the funny portraits, although only two heads, I think are also very unique and easy to attract attention. Their registered trademark is a black cat, in the posture of playing the zither, the humorous meaning is even stronger.</p>
<p>Because they focus on the amount, the display of various patterns of neckties is almost full. In terms of color, light colors are the main body, because it is now the hot summer.</p>
<p>Finally, Huamei Tobacco Company's own window decorations this time are very magnificent. They use the colors of green, yellow, blue, and red silk to represent their four kinds of cigarettes. At night, the light shines in all directions, which is indeed very stimulating. Which of the two is better depends entirely on the individual's point of view.</p>

<p>Supply and Demand Both Stand in Equilibrium</p>
<p>Half-Day Process Continues to Show Hesitant Climate</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw that although the silver market has rebounded, the increase is not much, and people's minds have not been hit, but are relatively stable. It is estimated that private telegrams are still shrinking, and the market situation in the first half of the day is still weak after the initial firmness, with a mediocre situation. Initially, overseas silver markets rose in the UK and remained flat in the US, and the futures silver price of the Metals Exchange rose by 0.22 to 0.37 cents. The exchange rate was flat, the price of London raw gold rose by half a penny, US wheat shrank by 0.2 cents, US cotton fell by 24 pounds per quintal, stocks fell slightly, and the prices of goods opened flat. Preliminary transactions opened slightly stable. Yuqing Yongfuxing Yongyongli and others bought one after another, rising to 92.3 yuan. After the opening, although buyers surged, the banks' appetite tended to be full, and sellers were also active, rising high and falling again. The HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged, the market was quite flat, and the fluctuations were also narrow. In the end, due to the slight loosening of the foreign exchange market, the banks continued to supply, and people's minds have also turned weak, gradually falling downstream. However, the supply and demand in the field are balanced, and the gold market is still hovering. Later, the Seattle night market silver price reported a rise of 0.1 to 0.5 points and 1.375. People's minds were originally timid, so a selling trend started, once breaking the 90 yuan mark. However, the falling trend was weak, because the Seattle night market silver price was not noticed by general major investors. The industry still had the intention of cutting prices, resulting in a peaceful domestic market. Many buyers took advantage of the low price, and the gold price gradually rose. The situation at noon was very stable, because the Seattle night market silver price had reports of non-movement and shrinking by 0.25, and the silver market trend was observed to be unlikely to rise again, and people's minds were still good, and the shorts had slightly closed their positions. The swap situation was stable, with a discount of about 3.5 yuan. The spot market situation was calm. Today, the market situation in the first half of the day will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was 992.4 yuan, an increase of 1.8 yuan compared to the previous closing. The price of goods opened at 2.6 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with the recent selling price of the British exchange at 1 shilling and 4 pence 0.09375, and the US exchange at 33.8125 yuan. Yuqing Yongfuxing Yongshunmao and others came in, and it rose from 2 yuan to 3.1 yuan. Pan Gen came out with the November US dollar 1.25 and 1.875. Magali British Saifen US dollar 0.9375, Dafa Yongyong Huixiang Yifeng Yongfuxing Yongcheng Kang sold the notes, retreating to 1.6 yuan, but because Yiyu Bingxing Tianfeng paid, it rose to 2.2 yuan, and people's minds were still failing to move downward. Yuanfeng Yonglai sold, and it was reduced to 1.6 yuan. At this time, HSBC announced that the exchange rate was not moving and was flat. In the end, Shen Kang Dadecheng Hengyu and Cuitai came in one after another, still rising to 2.2 yuan. Later, Fuxing Yongyongli Zhaofeng Changfu An Yicheng came to sell. Huabi came out with the September US dollar 34 yuan, and it retreated to 0.06 yuan. Tianfeng Hongxing Qingfa Yongyu Qingyong Hengtai took advantage of the low price to buy notes, rising to 1.7 yuan. The banks' appetite was still full, and Hongli Hengyu Fuchang Yuanheng came to sell and fell again to 0.04 yuan. Dadecheng Yuqing Yong Zhaofeng Chang came back to buy, and then rose to 1.5 yuan. Shengda Huixiang took advantage of the high price to sell and it fell. By the time the night market silver price was reported to have risen by 0.1, a selling trend started immediately. Shunmao also sold, and it broke the 90 yuan mark, falling to 989.8 yuan. Fuxing Yong Dadecheng repeatedly entered notes and worked hard to maintain it. It gradually recovered, and Yuanchang Yong Huixiang Yifeng Yonglai entered, further rising to 992 yuan. The closing price at noon was 991.6 yuan. The price of goods was 1.8 yuan, and it was relatively stable after the close. Tianfeng Yongfu Taiheng had some appetite. Finally, it rose to 2.5 yuan. It was found that the highest price in the first half of the day was 993.1 yuan, and the lowest price was 989.8 yuan, a fluctuation of 3.3 yuan. As a result, it rose by 1 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was that the HSBC US dollar exchange rate remained unchanged at 33.625 yuan, and the combined standard gold price was 1,029 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 27 yuan less, which was 1 yuan less than the previous closing. The accounting price for August was 996 yuan, and for September was 992 yuan. The water replenishment in the morning was 996 yuan. There were not many spot transactions, and the customer helped silently. Only Yingfeng Heng slightly bought in, calculated at 15 yuan added. The swap situation was indeed stable, because the spot dealers had turned silent. It is estimated that the source of spot goods will be in August. Today, Dadecheng posted 35 notes to Qianchangxiang for 3.3 yuan, while Yuqing Yong posted 42 notes to Dadecheng for 3.4 yuan. In addition, the shorts had the intention of swapping out, but the longs were watching from the sidelines. Hengxing transferred 560 August notes to Yingfengheng, priced at 997 yuan.</p>
<p>The trading in the field was flat. In total, Yuqing Yong Tianfeng Yongli Hengtai Xianghe Yiyu Dakang Futaiheng Tianfeng Yong Yuanchang Yong Cuitai Bingxing Shunli were the buyers. Yicheng Dafa Yong Zhaofeng Chang Huixiang Yifeng Yongfu Yuanyong Yongde Tongchun Dingtai Shengda Yuanheng etc. were the sellers.

Dalian Gang Shunli made a total of more than 1,100 notes and pushed in more than 100 notes. Wanxing made a total of more than 500 notes and did not make much progress. Guangbang Shengda slightly sold out, and Hengxing was silent.</p>
<p>For the August notes that have not yet been settled, the buyers still calculate Fuchang at more than 6,100 notes, Wanxing at slightly more than 6,000, Shunli at more than 4,300, and Chengkang at slightly more than 300.

<h3 id="e239">Securities "Nine-Six" Reorganization Clearly Disappoints <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Reply Offers No Solution</p>
<p>Long Positions Unload, Price Plunges Over One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced a significant turmoil regarding the "Nine-Six" securities. Initially, there was some hope for reorganization. However, news arrived from the north that the Ministry of Finance had replied, stating that it was impossible to reorganize "Nine-Six." Long positions, losing all hope, rushed to unload their holdings, fearing they would be unable to sell. The market price plummeted sharply. As the situation became clear and many long positions sought to sell, the downward trend is likely to intensify. The price had been driven too high previously due to the reorganization rumors, and now, without reorganization, the fall is bound to be even more severe. The difference between the high and low prices, within just two weeks, was as much as ten yuan, demonstrating the danger of speculation. Other securities could have seen price increases, but due to the sharp fall of "Nine-Six," market sentiment turned negative, and they also weakened in tandem. In reality, "Nine-Six" has no principal or interest and has always been separate and independent, with no connection to other securities. Yesterday, at the opening, various bonds saw slight increases of 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. However, "Nine-Six" bucked the trend, falling from high to low, dropping by 0.45 yuan. As news of the Ministry of Finance's reply gradually spread, "Nine-Six" plummeted by 0.9 yuan, and other securities also fell by small amounts, from 0.2 to 0.5 yuan. The final results showed mixed performance. Securities listed earlier were slightly better by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, while those closed off were slightly lower by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. "Nine-Six" alone fell by 1.25 yuan. Trading was only for the month of August, with a total transaction value of 9,241,000 yuan. The price changes are listed in the comparison table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Xin Feng &amp; Co. reports that yesterday (the 24th) the New York stock market initially rose slightly in the morning, but then selling pressure intensified, with sell orders coming from all over the country. The telegraph machines were overwhelmed. The volume of trading was remarkable. Wall Street analysts are clearly concerned about the drought in the American Midwest and the strike by livestock handlers in Chicago. The livestock market has already been affected. Before the close, the market rallied slightly. The small exchange was mixed and slightly lower. The bond market trended downward as speculators sold off, with railway bonds being sold particularly heavily. Chicago wheat also fell, as the weather improved, and bulls believed that the crop reports would be better than before, and so sold off. The total daily volume was 1.59 million shares (securities). The gains made in the morning were lost in the last half hour of trading. However, despite the large supply, most stocks showed good resistance. (Wheat) Fell because of bull selling; the situation favors the long side, but buyers are not paying attention, and it is expected that wheat prices will eventually adjust to the conditions of the poor harvest. (Cotton) The drought continues unabated, but scattered showers are of some help. Disturbances in the Gulf of Mexico are now moving westward. Growth in the central and western regions is quite satisfactory. The statistical position has not improved. The cloth market is quiet. (Rubber) The market is calm, and industry interest is increasing. The estimated exports from Malaya total 52,000 tons, the lowest in ten months. (Sugar) The industry is waiting for the outcome of the Cuban treaty. Widespread optimism is reflected in the stability of spot prices and the improvement in demand for refined sugar. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is stable, with a seemingly strong trend. The demand is growing, and merchants from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong are showing more interest in purchasing yarn. As a result, buying interest is increasing, and many believe that the reduction in production at various factories will lead to a general increase in prices. However, the final trade of this month in the afternoon saw a large sell-off, with prices plummeting by 1.7 yuan to 178 yuan, 4.3 yuan lower than the price in June.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn auction opened with US cotton falling by more than 20 points. Before the opening, it was expected that the near month would fall, but the distant months became tight, with few sellers. The near month fell by a fraction of a yuan, while the distant months rose by 2 to 3 jiao. By the 113th lot, the cotton market had also risen, and the yarn market became more stable. As a result, the near month fell by 1 jiao, while the distant months rose by 4 to 5 jiao. The afternoon opening saw a very tight market, as speculators were reportedly buying yarn for the near month. All months rose by 4 to 7 jiao. At the close, a large sell-off in the near month caused a sudden drop of 1.7 yuan, and the distant months also fell by 3 to 4 jiao. The near month fell by 1.2 yuan, the middle months rose by 3 to 4 jiao, and the distant months remained unchanged. However, 2,300 to 2,400 bales of spot yarn were sold, but this did not excite the market, which was completely affected by the near month. The total daily volume was 52,850 bales. Sen Kang sold 1,900 bales, Yuan Da 2,250 bales, Ming De 2,910 bales, Run Kang 1,750 bales, Chang Feng 1,850 bales, Yuan Feng 1,700 bales, Zhen Da 600 bales, Yuan Da 1,100 bales, and Chang Yu 850 bales.

<p>The cotton market has stabilized again. US cotton fell by more than 20 points, but the local cotton market remained firm as shorts covered their positions, causing the market to tighten. Some traders withdrew their near-month delivery quotas due to low prices, and the market moved upward. The overall trend is still subdued, and spot cotton sales remain sluggish.</p>

<p>Before the opening of the cotton auction, most expected a fall of several jiao, as US cotton had fallen sharply by over 20 points and Indian cotton was also weak. However, shorts covered their positions at the lower prices, and the market opened with tightening prices. However, there were still many sellers of new cotton, while old cotton was relatively stable. As a result, all months fell by 0.05 yuan. In the afternoon, as it was the last day for the near month, shorts covered their positions by withdrawing some of their deliveries, causing prices to tighten, and distant months also strengthened. As a result, all months rose by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan, but prices loosened again at the close. The total daily volume was 147,800 dan.

Various months also broke through the 0.4 yuan mark, with transaction volume reaching 1.9 million bags, demonstrating the seriousness of the situation, a first in nearly two years. When quoting prices, foreign wheat prices fell by 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 yuan respectively. The near month opened at only 0.35 yuan, but due to the rising price of grain on the northern route and purchases by Tianjin merchants (reportedly selling 60,000 bags per day there, so buying interest was very strong), the demand was very urgent, so distant months also opened strong. After the second trade, northern merchants aggressively bought, flipping from short to long. The near month also formed a squeeze due to delivery, which led to large purchases in the distant months, and prices rose rapidly. Although the major factories tried their best to sell during each trade, the situation was out of control, and their efforts were in vain. The only way to solve the problem is to eliminate the foreign wheat tax and relieve the tension. As a result, the near month rose by another 0.0675 yuan, August rose by 0.06 yuan, September rose by 0.0525 yuan, October rose by 0.0475 yuan, November rose by 0.04 yuan, and December rose by 0.0375 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Futures Wheat Also Experiences Strong Rally <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw a trend of initial stability followed by increases after the morning opening. Foreign wheat was quoted at approximately 0.6 to 0.7 yuan for Chicago and 0.5 to 0.6 yuan for Canada. The market sentiment was flat at the start, similar to the previous day. After the second trade, the sharp rise in the flour market greatly excited the market sentiment, and the buying interest from both inside and outside the industry was extremely strong. Also, a large trader outside the industry pushed up prices, causing the rise in various months to be alarming. If the government does not intervene in this type of unrealistic and purely speculative frenzy, the future consequences are potentially unlimited. As a result, the near month rose by 0.06 yuan, August rose by 0.09 yuan, September rose by 0.11 yuan, October and November rose by 0.1 yuan, and December rose by 0.09 yuan. Spot wheat sales are still strong. Each grain merchant is raising prices by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. Bengbu wheat is priced at 3.456 yuan, Yaowan wheat is priced at 3.41 yuan, Linhuaiguan wheat is priced at 3.45 yuan, Yangzhou wheat is priced at 3.38 yuan, Nanjing Danyang wheat is priced at 3.33 yuan, Gaoyou wheat is priced at 3.4 yuan, Pukou Jiangxinzhou wheat is priced at 3.27 yuan, Hankou wheat is priced at 3.04 yuan, Zhumadian wheat is priced at 3.37 yuan, and Wuhe wheat is priced at 3.47 yuan. Yufeng took 8,000 bags, Fuxin took 6 bags, Shen Da took 3,000 bags, and Xin Da took 5,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Foreign Rice Continues to Fall, Prices Are Near and Trend Increasingly Dramatically <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw a significant decline. Since the announcement of rice orders, the market has been apprehensive. Although no formal orders have been placed, the market price has been significantly suppressed. News from Saigon overseas is also declining steadily. It is expected that there will be no surplus available from Yangon this year, as they are in contact with India, and no exports from Siam or Annam. Therefore, the only source of rice orders is Saigon. Yesterday, Yuanli telegram reported that the Saigon fixed price was only 4.5 to 4.4 yuan, which is approaching the market price in Shanghai, so the market is naturally panicking. Xiaowen rice was traded at 1,500 bags, with prices falling from 8.05 yuan to 7.8 yuan, a difference of 0.5 yuan, the actual price fell about 0.2 yuan. There was also 140 bags of old No. 1 Saigon rice, priced at 8.9 yuan, which was purchased by inland merchants. The supply of Ke Xian rice continues, with deliveries arriving from Hunan and the Yangtze River region. However, sales in the local market are sluggish and the market is stagnant. Yesterday, 500 bags of each Hunan machine-polished rice and Jing machine-polished oil, 200 bags of Pei Jing rice, 100 bags of Shashi machine rice, and 282 bags of Hankou brown rice were available. Prices were all down about 0.1 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e252">(South Shanghai) Thirteen or fourteen vessels arrived from various sources yesterday (approximately 2,000 shi of goods). <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>Warehouses in this district are sluggish, and only a small number of people are actively buying. Therefore, sellers have lowered prices again to try to sell quickly, and the market is in decline. Seeing prices fall, North Ocean merchants suddenly made a move, buying about 1,000 bags of Qingjiao Songsi late rice from Jinan and Qingdao, with high-quality japonica and late rice selling for 0.2 to 0.3 yuan less, second-rate rice selling for 0.4 to 0.5 yuan less, and Du Yangjian selling for a little over 0.2 yuan less. Bianyuan also sold for over 0.1 yuan less.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Eight or nine sources of goods arrived from the Hexia area yesterday. Sales on the market are still sluggish. High-quality japonica rice is down about 0.2 yuan, and medium-quality and second-rate rice are down 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. Thin rice is the same. Early rice and Yang Du Jian are down 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Bai Yuan is a little smaller than expected.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Yellow Soybeans Sell Well <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, New Town Gate soybeans from Jiujiang continued to fall by a fraction, with prices opening at 3.55 to 3.4 yuan. More than 300 bags were traded, all of which were leftover goods from the previous day. The destination was still the Ningbo and local merchants. There were 500 to 600 bags remaining unstored. Currently, market sentiment is that the high-priced goods will decline only slightly, so the future situation may be stable. There are no new soybeans from Hankou available. The market for old soybeans is high and stable, as the supply of high-quality goods is decreasing. As a result, factory warehouses of second-grade goods are active, and market prices continue to rise. Yesterday, a train of Zhengyangguan soybeans was unloaded, priced at 5.24 to 5.2 yuan, and two trains of Feihe soybeans were priced at 3.16 to 3.1 yuan, all of which were sold in this area. In addition, factories purchased one train of Quanhe soybeans, priced at 3 yuan. It is also reported that Xinhuai merchants purchased 400 bags of Hankou Xinyangzhou soybeans, priced at 2.9 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market showed a stable trend. The customs gold settlement price was 1.994. The guild's marked price for No. 24 coarse white spot was 19.9 yuan, with dock delivery at 19.97 yuan, warehouse goods at 20 yuan, transit goods at 6.45 yuan, Dutch red at 15.2 yuan, Taikoo Sugar B Mark at 20.4 yuan, and No. 1 fine white from the factory at 19 yuan. Foreign firms opened immediate shipment of No. 24 coarse white at 3.25 yuan, and September/October shipment at 3.225 yuan, totaling over 300 tons. Chao merchants opened Huanggang Qing at 13.2 to 13.3 yuan, and Long Kong Qing at 12.65 yuan, up 0.1 yuan. Guangdong merchants opened Huizhou white at 300 to 400 bags, top grade at 18.2 yuan, second grade at 17.5 yuan, 17 yuan, and 16.5 yuan, and the lowest grade at 15.3 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e255">North Goods: White Lotus Scarce, Prices Rise <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>White lotus prices had fallen previously due to loosening land prices, reaching a low of 25.6 yuan. Now, as the market is more active, prices are rising again. According to news from Lanxi yesterday, prices have risen to 30 yuan, with no goods available for sale, a recovery of approximately 4 yuan. Recently, Guangdong and Shantou merchants have shown considerable demand. It is reported that the previous low was 30 yuan, and yesterday's price was 35 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Few New Zhangzhou Branches Arrive <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>The second batch of new Zhangzhou branches arrived yesterday via the Jinan wheel, totaling only 80+ pieces. There were also only 23 pieces of new orchid seeds. If the quality of the goods is superior, the opening price will not fluctuate too much. The opening is expected to be day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Silk and Tea: Silk Sales Exceptionally Bleak <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>London Jili Yarn Reportedly Falls Again: According to reliable news from the British merchant, Taihe &amp; Co., the London market saw a further decline in Chinese silk prices due to Japanese silk devaluation dumping. Jili dried yarn A-grade cocoon scale Feilong Horse brand opened at only 5 shillings 6 pence on Monday, and B-grade black silk brand opened at only 5 shillings, each down 1.5 pence from the previous weekend, equivalent to a decrease of about 10 yuan per bale in Chinese currency.</p>
<p>American Sales of Chinese Silk Remain Weak: The sluggishness of American sales of Chinese silk has reached an extreme. Japanese silk has been actively dumping at factory prices in the United States recently, causing the sales of Chinese silk to the United States to remain weak. Yesterday, the New York class Taiyi wheel left without any silk shipped to the United States. The future of American sales is exceptionally bleak.</p>
<p>Gangmen Seizes Cheap Opportunities to Purchase Factory Yarn: Overseas raw silk prices are gradually falling, and silk sales are sluggish, with little prospect of a turnaround in the near future. European and American firms in Shanghai are still considering suppressing prices and stockpiling. Meanwhile, inland Gang factories are seizing cheap opportunities to purchase factory yarn. Among the manufacturers with relatively abundant inventory, some are reluctantly selling at a loss to maintain production. Although over a hundred bales of new factory yarn were traded yesterday, this was not a formal market transaction, so the silk brand prices were kept secret.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Black and Green Tea Fall Again and Again <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai tea market, the British and French firms were still interested in the Zhenmei Zhucha teas from Tunxi, Wudong, and Shexian areas. However, due to the large number of arrivals recently, supply exceeded demand. In the previous weeks, the prices of each tea have been reduced by 22 to 23 percent. However, due to weak sentiment, the market continues to decline. Yesterday, the selling price for road farm core-removed Zhenmei was reduced to 138 yuan, Tunxi Yuanzhen was reduced to 92 yuan, and Wuyuan North Road Zhenmei was reduced to 104 yuan. The prices of other black and green teas were also reduced by 4 to 5 yuan across the board. Based on the current market situation, there seems to be no hope for tea prices to rebound.</p>

<p>My country's Shuang Gong silk has long been sold to India. The silk quality is not inferior to factory-reeled silk, and the texture is more uniform than Jili silk. The selling price is not high, so Indian silk factories are happy to purchase it. Recently, demand for Shuang Gong silk in India remains strong. Yesterday, the British postal ship Blue C No. also had 35 pieces of Shuang Gong silk loaded for Mumbai.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Sometimes, if she really felt like she had nothing to do, she would occasionally play solitaire. We would stand behind her, keeping a close watch for her. If she made a mistake, we would point it out. Also, if she needed glasses, a pipe, or other small items, and these items were nearby and easily within reach, we would go and get them for her. However, if these items were far away and required more effort to retrieve, we would let the palace maids handle it. In short, the palace maids were responsible for the more strenuous tasks, while we, as female officials, could disregard them.</p>
<p>Please forgive my boldness in saying something boastful: although we eight female officials had different personalities, we all had very attractive appearances. Perhaps this goes without saying, but it isn't far from the truth, so I'll just say it directly! We all wore the same headdresses, but we were careful to avoid uniformity in our clothing. Not only did we avoid imitating each other's styles, but we also ensured that the colors of our clothes didn't clash. For example, if someone wore a light red dress one day, the other seven would not wear that color. So when the eight of us stood together, onlookers couldn't help but praise our beauty; even we ourselves felt pleased, especially since we were all young and, once dressed up, each of us looked extremely beautiful!</p>
<p>Every night, after the Empress Dowager had fallen asleep, one of us had to attend to her in her bedroom. Because this was a more tiring task, we took turns being on duty. Each of us was on duty once every seven days, and we didn't find it too difficult. However, before the Empress Dowager fell asleep, the person attending to her had to talk to her casually until she started snoring loudly. Fortunately, this didn't take too long, so everyone could manage. Even more fortunately, she never suffered from insomnia, or it would have been terrible! (91)</p>
<h3 id="e261">申報's Elder Brother <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>Of all the newspapers printed in Chinese characters that still exist today, everyone considers 申報 to be the eldest brother.</p>
<p>Because it is already sixty-two years old this year. However, Mr. Cheng Zhanlu told me that there is also a "Circulation Daily" in Hong Kong, which held its seventieth anniversary celebration last year and printed a commemorative album with a photo of the founder, Wang Tao, on it. So it is nine years older than 申報, and should be called the eldest brother. Because it is not sold in the mainland, everyone is unaware of it.</p>
<p>According to the Nanjing court gazette, Macau was the first place to publish Chinese newspapers, probably during the Daoguang and Xianfeng periods. Unfortunately, they were all short-lived. Due to cultural backwardness and the shift of commercial centers, there were no successors, so everyone has lost even the historical impression of this.</p>
<p>Speaking of newspapers in China, there were two types in the Tang Dynasty: "Miscellaneous Reports" and "Di Reports." The former was found in Sun Kezhi's collected works, and the latter was found in the Complete Tang Tales. It is unknown whether the Miscellaneous Reports are the same as the Di Reports, but their content can be inferred to be similar to the Qing Dynasty's Palace Gate Copies. The Palace Gate Copies were copied from the Inner Cabinet and printed using woodblocks. They were distributed to Beijing officials every evening, and the delivery person was paid four strings of cash per month. Later, with the advent of news newspapers, vendors could be entrusted with delivery, and two strings of cash per month were enough. The content was only the imperial edicts announced that day and the names of officials summoned, as well as the names of important provincial officials arriving in Beijing, which was not very meaningful.</p>
<p>"Qiu Shui Sheng's Textual Research" cites Zhao Shu's "Essentials of Court and Wildness," which states that "The court gazette is compiled by the Later Province every day, and those called 'Inner Probes,' 'Provincial Probes,' and 'Yamen Probes' are all private small reports, and there is a prohibition against leakage, so they are secretly called 'News.'" It is unknown what political organization the Later Province is. "Probes" are very similar to today's "reporters." In my childhood, I saw people selling small, leaflet-like news newspapers called "court gazettes" while banging small gongs. They had the same name but different content from the court gazettes mentioned in the "Essentials of Court and Wildness," or perhaps they were imitations compiled and printed by the people, and they contained social news, which was very much in line with the meaning of "private small reports."</p>
<h3 id="e262">The Omen of Assemblies <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Xue</p>
<p>"Assembly" is a common word in Suzhou people's vocabulary, they always say it several times a day. "Assembly today," "assembly tomorrow," "evening assembly," "meeting assembly," everyone says it very fluently. Who would have thought that it would be an omen for the severe drought of the year? I was born in the Republican era, and I have certainly enjoyed many material blessings, but parading with idols in processions is something I have never seen. I have only heard elderly people talk about the grand occasions of the "Three Festival Assemblies" in the Qing Dynasty. These dozens of days of drought, though disastrous for the old farmers, have benefited me. What have they benefited me? It is that I have assemblies to watch every day. I watched the assembly today, then watched the assembly tomorrow; watched the evening assembly, then watched the meeting assembly. Who would have thought that for the sake of seeking rain, the clay and wooden sculptures inside and outside Suzhou city would be so active, and I could see this "reverse gear" idol race.</p>
<p>After the Guan Di assembly came the Fierce General assembly. After all, the Fierce General has a big face. After the assembly, there was a drizzle. The devout men and women said, "Guan Di couldn't break into the South Heaven Gate, so seeking rain was ineffective. The Fierce General was once conferred the title of Heavenly King, and he is the Jade Emperor's nephew, so he can directly enter the South Heaven Gate and pester his mother to bring some rain. Therefore, as soon as the Fierce General left the temple, there was a sign of rain in the sky." These superstitious, ghost-seeing words made believers nod their heads, but to me, it was just like setting off firecrackers in the back slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>The Horse King Temple, which is worshiped by grooms, had a grand race a few days ago. All the horses in the city joined the race. The banner of "Horse Bright King" fluttered in the wind, how magnificent! But as I see it, in addition to the Horse King Temple, there are also the Cow King Temple and the Snake King Temple in Suzhou city. If they were made in the same way, a fire cow formation could be arranged in the Cow King assembly, and a long snake formation could be arranged in the Snake King assembly. Furthermore, in Temple Hall Lane, there is a Gecko King Temple. If the Gecko King also came out to seek rain, I'm afraid that all the bedbugs in Suzhou city would have no chance to join.</p>
<p>Emperor Rang and Jiang Taigong came out on the same day. Who is Emperor Rang? He is Wu Taibo, the uncle of King Wen of Zhou. In terms of qualifications, he is certainly above Taigong. The two races met in the middle of the road. In theory, Taigong should yield to Taibo, but Taibo should not yield to Taigong. However, that day, Wu Taibo instead cleared the way, letting Jiang Shang, holding the apricot yellow flag, pass by in a grand manner. This was not appropriate in terms of etiquette. However, the incense burners defended Old Jiang, saying that "Jiang Taigong gets promoted one rank when he meets an official, so he certainly wouldn't give face to Wu Taibo."</p>

<p>Chapter 32: General Amuses Himself with Pleasures All Day Long; Soldiers Return with Few Amidst Tears from Young and Old</p>
<p>Gui Zhi replied from inside the house: "We wouldn't dare to accept that. Even a concubine is a million times better than us. How could we dare say we're not qualified?" When Jiang heard them arguing, she knew this wasn't the way to go, so she interjected, "In that case, I'll accompany these old sisters for a walk. I'll have a good talk with the concubine, and she'll understand." The old woman just wanted to complete her task so she could reduce her own responsibility, and she didn't necessarily need to bring Gui Zhi along. So she smiled and said, "That's good too. You can come with me." Jiang had prepared a long and well-reasoned speech, planning to both avoid offending the concubine and win her over. She followed the old woman into Commander Quan's mansion, went upstairs, and the old woman asked Jiang to wait in the hallway. She went into a room. From the gate to the hallway upstairs, soldiers guarded every door in this mansion. Especially near the door in the hallway, two soldiers with box cannons hanging from their waists narrowed their eyes and scrutinized people. Jiang couldn't enter, nor did she dare to retreat. After a very long time, the old woman came out with an unpleasant expression. Seeing Jiang, she forced a smile and said, "Our concubine is busy, why don't you go see our commander first." Jiang tugged at her clothes twice, took two steps back, and frowned, "How can I see the commander?" The old woman said, "It's alright, he's very amiable. You can just say a few words to him, and I'll bring you out." Jiang thought that since she had already come this far, it wouldn't do to back down completely. So she straightened her chest slightly, cheered herself up, and followed the old woman into a room. Jiang only felt that she was stepping on something soft, and the room was furnished with smooth, bright things. There was a large and thick low chair, completely made of green velvet. A man in a suit sat there with his legs crossed, a cigarette in his mouth, and an attitude of not caring about people. He only glanced sideways, not even turning his head. (442)</p>

<p>— Wei Ji</p>
<p>In our village, Old Aunt Ah Da and her husband were known as a loving couple. But yesterday I walked past Fourth Horse Road and saw her smiling coquettishly at passersby, making a living from her flesh.</p>
<p>Today, a fellow villager, Mr. Liu, visited. He mentioned Old Aunt Ah Da's matter. I specially record it below for the reference of village women in general.</p>
<p>Old Aunt Ah Da's husband was affected by the bankruptcy of the rural economy and had no choice but to tell Old Aunt Ah Da to go to the city to make a living.</p>
<p>One morning, Old Aunt Ah Da bid farewell to her husband and boarded a small boat, heading into the evil furnace.</p>
<p>In the first few months, Old Aunt Ah Da would bring news to her husband whenever there was a convenient boat. Later, the news gradually became less frequent. According to people who sold goods in the city, Old Aunt Ah Da was different from before. But Old Aunt Ah Da's husband didn't believe it.</p>
<p>One day, at noon, Old Aunt Ah Da suddenly brought a man to the countryside. She asked her husband for a divorce. She left that night.</p>
<p>Later, people in the countryside didn't know her whereabouts, nor did they get any news from her.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw her making a living from her flesh on Fourth Horse Road. I don't know who harmed her.</p>

<p>Dr. Moscicki is the President of Poland, but at the same time, he is also an inventor. Recently, he gathered many doctors and scientists to the Presidential Palace and took out a machine, saying that it was invented by him and could produce the air at the top, and this machine has a lot of help in medicine. The only purpose of the President's invention of this machine is to obtain the same air in urban hospitals as in the sanatoriums on the mountaintops, which is naturally of great benefit to patients.</p>

<p>In Chicago, a school will be established exclusively for wives to teach them how to be reasonably selfish, because the movie star Mary Pickford once said, "Women should know that so-called charity can sometimes lead to a decadent and weak influence. Therefore, there is a great need for a school here to educate wives on how to do all kinds of self-interested things in a reasonable way. People who don't know how to benefit themselves sometimes cause themselves misfortune."</p>

<p>Begging in Istanbul is very easy. You can almost get four shillings per hour (equivalent to more than two yuan in Chinese currency). A Turkish journalist recently traveled there and discovered this shocking event. Such almsgiving to beggars is indeed a shocking event in society, and there is even a spirit of mutual assistance among the beggars. For example, if a beggar commits a crime and is imprisoned, when he is released from prison, he has no money on him. The other beggars will lend him money.</p>

<p>In the Colony area, film education will be promoted in the near future. After that, as long as a mother has more than three sons, she can go to the theater for free once a month to watch a movie. The local authorities are paying close attention to this event and will work with cinemas to show films that are beneficial to motherly education.</p>

<p>San Francisco's Chinatown is the residence of overseas Chinese. Because the American authorities are convinced that American houses are more useful and safer, the houses in Chinatown will be gradually transformed. Currently, all the buildings in Chinatown have oriental colors, and most Chinese merchants advocate maintaining the status quo. However, local leaders oppose this point, advocating that all houses must be built in the Western style in the future, while allowing the preservation of various oriental decorations and embellishments.</p>

It is said that it will sink nine inches in a hundred years, because it is said that the tributary of the Thames River was filled in 10,000 years ago, and all the holes have now dropped sixty to seventy feet. This is clear evidence. If this is true, then will London not sink into the water in a few years?</p>

<p>This is really the most unlucky thing! In Vienna, an assistant in a bookstore recently bought a lottery ticket. One day, he went to a restaurant to eat a meal, but forgot to bring money. Unable to think of a way, he gave the lottery ticket to them. Who knew that on the day of the draw, this lottery ticket won the prize, winning a prize of 80,000 Schillings (Austrian currency), equivalent to 2,000 pounds in English currency. The price of this meal can be considered the most expensive. Do you think this person is unlucky? (Huang Yingdai)</p>

<p>— Cen</p>
<p>Yang Yongtai, Secretary-General of the Headquarters, recently gave a speech at the Post-Recovery Training Conference in various districts, saying "Revolution must first revolutionize the heart, political reform must first change customs." The general idea is that the chaos in China is all due to bad people's hearts, so to transform China, we must first transform people's hearts, and to reform politics, we must start by reforming social customs. Therefore, it is necessary for a few people at the top to lead the way in changing customs and thoroughly carry out the work of revolutionizing the heart today. The speech, which was more than 10,000 words long, was well-organized and can be said to be a magnificent work of the present time. The reasoning is so precise that it is beyond the reach of others. In today's state of moral corruption and depressed people's hearts, this may be considered a powerful criticism.</p>
<p>The hearts of the Chinese people today are indeed so bad. Those at the top are greedy, selfish, base, and vulgar, and will do anything. Those at the bottom are busy with petty gains, opportunistic, and obsequious. People in the world hardly know the word "shame." The higher the position, the more shameless they are. As for the common people, they live in hunger and cold every day. It is as difficult for them to eat a full meal as it is to ascend to heaven. Poverty has crushed every common person, and now every common person lives below the hunger and poverty line. The social atmosphere is indeed too bad. Without a thorough transformation, Chinese society will simply be unable to be saved, and the entire Chinese nation will be unable to be liberated. Therefore, reforming Chinese society is indeed very necessary today.</p>
<p>However, I still have a point to make. Revolution must first revolutionize the heart, political reform must first change customs. Where should we start? I think we should start from the upper levels. Because, as I said before, the most shameless and worst people in society are some upper-level people with status, that is, the shameless and corrupt bureaucrats that the Chairman and Mr. Yang Yongtai despise. These corrupt and shameless bureaucrats are the main instigators of the worst atmosphere in China today. To transform the atmosphere and revolutionize the heart, I think we should start with these people, and transform these people. This is the fundamental way. As for the common people, as I said before, they still have difficulty eating a full meal. Greed and shamelessness seem to be out of the question for them. Even if there is, it is only a matter of eating, which does not involve the scope of greed and shamelessness, so it can be ignored. In this way, transforming people's hearts should first start with the upper-level people. This point is undoubtedly true.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the problem of the common people. Now the common people are all worried about not having enough to eat. In the case of not having enough to eat, they may not be able to take care of many things like etiquette and law, which is indeed a bit illegal. However, this illegality is entirely due to hunger and is far different from the corruption of bureaucrats. The solution should start from how to ensure that everyone has enough to eat. Simply punishing with laws or killing seems to be useless. Once the problem of eating is solved, other problems can naturally be solved as well. This is a fundamental problem. If this problem is not solved, other opinions may become empty talk.</p>
<p>Revolution must first revolutionize the heart, political reform must first change customs, which is indeed very necessary today. However, how to revolutionize the heart and how to change customs are problems that must be studied first. Problems such as the common people's eating problems do not seem important at first glance, but they are actually extremely important. If you don't have enough to eat, what are you talking about etiquette and morality? So the most important problem is how to first give them enough to eat.</p>

<p>— Qing</p>
<p>In the open space, a large group of men and women were gathered around. Enclosed in the circle were a tall, sturdy man and a skinny little partner. The big man was showing his bare arms, his skin was dark brown, and it shined with sweat. Raising his high-pitched voice, he yelled, waving two wooden sticks back and forth in his hands, doing some tricks for people to see. As he yelled, he ran around in the circle. The little partner was beating a gong, and when the man shouted a sentence, he would follow with an echoing sound, and then beat the gong hard. Scattered on the ground were many things, and in the center were a few bowls, covered with a red cloth. This was what was able to make people stop and squeeze in to take a look. At the same time, they themselves were the only conservators of the secret. They first yelled desperately and beat the gong desperately. The purpose was nothing more than to attract more viewers and get more effects. Because, although there were many tricks, there were actually limited tricks, and they couldn't easily perform one after another. But the interest of the people watching was very fleeting. They were attracted by the loud yelling and gong sound to join in the fun, but it was only a momentary impulse of curiosity. At a glance, they saw that the two, one big and one small, had been fooling around for a long time, but hadn't done anything yet. The enthusiasm gradually disappeared. Moreover, everyone knows that it is a deceptive business. It's just curiosity, so they are also willing to be deceived for a while. However, the magicians never considered this. The man shouted for a while, then stopped shouting. Instead, he changed his posture, suddenly frowning and looking at the people around with a sad face, saying, "Sir, please do a good deed and give a few copper coins. We haven't had anything to eat or drink all day. Give a few copper coins, and we'll perform a magic trick right away." As he spoke, he pointed to the cloth on the ground.</p>
<p>But the shadow of a copper coin was nowhere to be seen. They hoped that everyone would first give copper coins and then do magic tricks, while the people standing were still considering whether to give, depending on how the magic trick was performed. Seeing this situation, the man's face became even more gloomy. He sighed in front of the crowd. Then, he forced a smile and did the same thing again, muttering words in his mouth.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>He waved the stick and ran around. The little partner beat the gong, but his expression was not as active as before.</p>
<p>This continued for a long time. At one point, they stopped again, stopped shouting, stretched out their hands to ask people for copper coins, almost four or five times. But the magic trick was never performed. Invisibly, they had completely cooled the little interest that everyone had in their hearts. They gradually went from disappointment to anger and disgust. Some people walked away cursing. More and more people walked away. The man looked even more anxious. He kept beating his chest and begging bitterly, "Masters, please do a good deed and give a few copper coins." After he said it himself, he told his little partner to kneel down and beg with him. In the end, the big man himself simply knelt on both knees. But still, no one dropped any copper coins, and instead, it caused a cold sneer. Everyone had the same feeling: they came to see magic tricks, not to see beggars perform.</p>
<p>So the begging begged, and the people walked away. The sound of begging did not disappear until all the people had dispersed. But it flowed to another place.</p>

<p>— Beggar of Words</p>
<p>"Doctor," as the name suggests, naturally makes patients live, but most of them make patients die.</p>
<p>"Hanging the pot to help the world" doctors were originally supposed to save people, but "hanging the pot to help the county" doctors, who became professional doctors, do not want to save people.</p>
<p>There are Western doctors who came from pharmacy boys, and there are Chinese doctors who do not understand pulse diagnosis or the properties of medicine. It is no wonder that many people die from illness.</p>
<p>Please call a doctor to pay a registration fee and a consultation fee, and enter the hospital to pay a room fee. Nine out of ten poor people die when they get sick.</p>
<p>Poor people have to wait for money to activate their lives, but the lives of rich people are often harmed by money.</p>
<p>There are barbers who cannot cut their own hair, so there is a good reason to say that there are also doctors who cannot cure their own diseases.</p>
<p>If doctors had to pay with their lives for the people they killed, I wonder if anyone would dare to be a doctor?</p>
<p>Doctors who kill patients and still don't understand what disease it was, but cure one patient, talk about their medical principles with exceptional precision.</p>
<p>There are no executioners who cannot kill people, therefore there are no doctors who cannot kill people.</p>
<p>Some doctors kill incurable patients quickly, while others prolong their suffering for a few more days. Doctors who kill them quickly are scolded, while doctors who prolong their suffering become famous.</p>

<p>— Tao</p>
<p>Opening my eyes and then closing them again, soon opening them once more, tossing and turning in bed like this. Having been awake for a long time, naturally, I wouldn't fall back asleep. I was merely using this method to pass the time until my stomach growled unbearably, forcing me to finally get out of bed. By then, the sun was high in the mid-sky, almost noon. Searching everywhere, all my possessions weren't even worth ten cents. How would I manage today?</p>
<p>Borrow some money! There was no other way. Everything that could be pawned had already been pawned. If I didn't take this path, was I really supposed to go hungry? But just thinking about the faces of those wealthy people sent a chill down my spine. Still, I had to bite the bullet and give it a try!</p>
<p>I hurriedly wiped my face and ran out.</p>
<p>Under the scorching June sun, it felt like being immersed in a brazier. And I was still wearing a thick camel hair robe. Yes, it had become my only companion. Otherwise, I had nothing of value. Every stranger passing by, whether going with or against the flow, stared at me with peculiar eyes. From these many gazes, I gleaned two different impressions. One probably thought I had typhoid fever and was afraid of the cold. The other clearly carried contempt and disdain. After seeing me, a poor wretch wearing a cotton-padded jacket in the summer heat, they would proudly glance back at their own silk or satin, thin, in-season attire. They felt immense glory, followed by a smug smile on their faces. Especially the noble ladies, barefoot, with their knees to their chests also exposed. Not to mention their shawls. So I faintly felt humiliating insults, and from the agitation of the insults, a kind of hatred and anger arose. But in a flash, I felt relieved again. You be smug, I'll do my thing. It's all nothing to do with me. Why get angry? The days of enjoyment won't last forever. Eventually, there will be a day when I step on the heads of these dogs and trample them severely!</p>
<p>I continued on my way, no longer thinking about those things, nor looking at those boring faces, pretending not to see them. While walking, I planned in my mind what words and methods to use to achieve the purpose of borrowing money. The weather was truly unbearably hot, and wearing that robe, like a quilt, almost made me faint. My undershirt was completely soaked with sweat, and every pore was desperately producing beads of sweat. The sweat on my forehead was like a torrential rain, constantly flowing down.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, I arrived at the house of the person I wanted to borrow money from. But as soon as I stepped through the door, I saw many boxes and luggage inside. Everyone was busy. I asked what was happening. It turned out the master was about to return to his hometown. Hearing this, my entire energy immediately cooled down. What to do? Could I even bring this up at this time? Seeing a continuous stream of people bringing gifts to see him off, I was the only exception. Thinking about it, there was no way I could say anything. It seemed hopeless. Moreover, I hadn't swallowed a grain of rice all day, and my vision was blurring in waves. In order to maintain appearances, knowing that I couldn't leave until I saw the master off to the ship, I waited and waited, sitting on pins and needles. During this time, I felt completely lost.</p>
<p>The master came out, saw me, and greeted me with a smile. I stood up emotionlessly and nodded. When he noticed me wearing that robe, he suddenly asked with concern: "It's so hot, and you're still wearing this. Are you not feeling well?"</p>
<p>"Um, um," I stuttered in reply. How could I explain?</p>
<p>The insults I encountered on the road were now being experienced again. Although the person asking might have been acting out of good intentions, I ultimately thought it was malicious.</p>
<p>When seeing the master off to the ship, on the ship, among a crowd of people, the master kept asking me if I was really not feeling well. How was I supposed to respond? Fine, I'll admit I'm not feeling well. But even so, I still couldn't cover up the embarrassing situation! The coldness and fickleness between people had been savored throughout this day, and this impression, similar to an insult, was more deeply engraved and not easy to forget than the one bestowed by strangers on the road.</p>

<p>— Firefly</p>
<p>Each day's bread must be dug out from under the pen. The ink in the inkwell has dried up, the nib is ruined, and my brain has been numbed by nicotine. This flesh and blood body is not a machine that can be driven by gasoline. I sit blankly at my writing desk, time slipping by like an arrow among the white clouds outside the window.</p>
<p>Words fail me.</p>
<p>Writing personal daily records has already been opposed. "Is there really not a single piece of important material in such a China, in such an era, for a supplement editor to collect and publish? Moreover, most of those articles record things that are mostly based on conjecture, and some are even the result of closed-door creation. Providing these false messages to readers seems inappropriate for an editor."</p>
<p>But you should write works of the times! Overthrow the capitalists! Workers of the world unite! Is that acceptable? Who isn't afraid of the bread-eating fellow moving the stage?</p>
<p>So the once-popular decadent, romantic works are the best strategy for writing articles. Beautiful little white doves! A woman's sexual desires! A bundle of love letters, and another bundle, can generate endless wealth. So many people talk about women, thinking it's a trouble-free way to take Jingzhou. But that fellow, a Gothic type who could distinguish the race of the opposite sex from a kiss, ran into a wall. Touching a woman's behind, like a native, is also not a business strategy.</p>
<p>The best material is naturally to grab someone's head and operate on it. The facts may be a hundred thousand miles away from the topic. From many big hats, draw soy sauce soup. After dozens of somersaults, the reader can't tell what it tastes like. But it's monopolized by the "special group." If you stand on their opposing front, you're either a "traitor" or a "spy." This kind of writing is writeable and unwriteable!</p>
<p>Some people also tell me it's best not to write. No matter how bad things get, don't move, don't move even a little! The method is certainly good. For example, after winning the lottery, throw the stick hiding the ticket into the Huangpu River. It's too far from the purpose of digging bread from under the pen. And cigarettes are very expensive. Why buy poison to kill the mosquitoes?</p>
<p>Words fail me. What should I do after all? The answer is an echo in the valley: What should I do after all?</p>

<p>— Juefu</p>
<p>It is people whose knowledge is deeper than ordinary people, whose learning is more profound than ordinary people, and whose virtue is nobler than ordinary people who are called saints. Once one becomes a saint, then every word and every sentence they utter must be regarded as the ultimate treasure, and every action and every movement is enough to be a model for thousands of generations. Confucius, the old master, is a saint, and is therefore respected as a teacher for all ages.</p>
<p>The so-called celebrities are different. Regardless of whether they are actually illiterate, regardless of their virtue and knowledge, regardless of how humble and shallow they are, and regardless of whether their rise to prominence is due to weapons, due to pens, due to business, ... as long as they can climb on top of a certain number of people, even the smallest details of their daily life are listed in the newspapers, they can be called celebrities.</p>
<p>The essence and growth of celebrities and saints are different, but the effect after their success is the same: because once a person becomes a celebrity, they seem to be omniscient and omnipotent. Every word they say is about benevolence and righteousness. As soon as they land in one place, everyone competes to treat them with reverence and spread their words everywhere. Moreover, everything they say and see is regarded as the ultimate truth and followed with sincerity. A financial tycoon can explain medical principles, a military leader can discuss educational rights and wrongs, a literary authority can talk about national defense plans, ... the reason is that they are celebrities.</p>
<p>Recently, no saints have appeared, and those who care about the world often can't help but lament their misfortune. However, with so many omniscient and omnipotent celebrities, what need is there for saints?</p>

<p>— Want to Return</p>
<p>It has been three days since I arrived here, and I have been busy running around visiting the elders of my hometown, and I simply haven't had time to write to you. Today is the anniversary of my ancestor's death, and it has been seven years since I fulfilled my responsibility as a junior to kneel three times. My father told me the night before, so this afternoon I can sit peacefully at home for a day. At lunchtime, I went to the ancestral hall, and the old house looked even more dilapidated. It was slightly tilted, and the corners were occupied by spiders, showing the declining phenomenon of the village. The spirit tablets of the ancestors were in the center. I piously lit incense and candles and kowtowed. My father still stood woodenly on the side. He probably remembered the glory of building the ancestral hall? At that time, I was only two years old. Later, after I entered private school, he would have us sit next to his grand master's chair after every meal and lecture on the situation of the construction at the time. He would describe it from my perspective in detail, but I didn't understand as much as he said. It was like listening to a moving story. However, repeated lectures later became as annoying as listening to my family's long-term worker tell "Once upon a time, a family." But I still quietly watched my father's proud smile, for the sake of many dishes after drinking! Like edamame and peanuts, for me to chew slowly. My father, on the other hand, smoked his pipe and stroked the sparse beard under his chin. It can be seen that his lecture was not to let his seven- or eight-year-old son know how to build a great ancestral hall, but to narrate this amazing story to make himself feel extra happy, and to expand his son into a listening object.</p>
<p>Now, I see him standing motionless for a long time. I pity him [the original text is unclear here, with several characters obscured], wanting him to tell me about the situation at that time in detail.</p>
<p>In lonely sorrow, we left the ancestral hall and went home. My father drank alcohol at lunch. My father originally loved alcohol as much as his life. In recent years, my mother told me that he suddenly stopped drinking. When asked, he wouldn't give a reason. Today, he suddenly thought of drinking again. My mother seemed to want to ask, but finally didn't have the courage. My father had no expression, as if oppressed by deep sorrow. He finished a pot of alcohol in half the usual time. His face was flushed, his nerves were slightly excited, and he spoke calmly.</p>
<p>"You have been away for seven years. In these seven years, our town has changed greatly, and our family has fallen to this state. When you were young, I talked about the construction of the ancestral hall every day. You still have some images. Your grandfather was so impressive at that time. He established our surname X's family all by himself. He was also afraid of the decline of future generations, so he set up a charitable estate and built the ancestral hall on a larger scale. But now, the charitable estate has been stolen by unfilial descendants, and some have been sold. The ancestral hall is dilapidated, and none of the descendants can continue his efforts. They don't know [the original text is unclear here] Zhu's enterprise, gambling on tickets, so Sixth Elder Uncle, in order to reprimand Xingguan in the third room</p>

<p>, became seriously ill and hasn't gotten out of bed yet... You, on the other hand, are respected by the clan. They say you are determined to study, and now you have graduated from university. I no longer have the money to cultivate you. I don't want you to be an official or anything. I just want you to revive my surname X's family, and it won't be in vain for my painstaking efforts..."</p>
<p>My father drank the remaining wine in his glass in one gulp and went back to his room to sleep in bed. My mother asked him if he wanted to eat, but he ignored her. He hoped so much that his son would be a great man who would revive the family, but this hope is probably forever a fantasy?</p>
<p>I can't bear to think about it, I can't bear to look at my father's wrinkled face without a trace of a smile!</p>

<h3 id="e281">Is This Also Environmental Oppression? <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I have a close friend who is very negative due to environmental oppression. His recent letters are so tragic that one can't bear to read them. If I don't find a way to help him, he may commit suicide. He is a man from an old-fashioned family, the eldest of two brothers. He is now twenty-three years old. At the age of nineteen, he was married by his parents' order and the words of a matchmaker. After the marriage, he went to the Japanese city to study. When he graduated from junior high school, his father was very unwilling for him to continue his studies, because his father had a store in the countryside, and no one was helping him. He managed everything by himself and wanted him to come back to help. But my friend is intelligent, has excellent literary skills, and is very ambitious. Not only was he unwilling to give up studying and become a merchant, but he also saw that the schools in City C were poorly managed, and he wanted to go to Beiping to continue his studies and strive for progress. Later, after asking a friend to request his father, he achieved his goal. Because the level of schools in the Japanese city was lower than that of schools in Beiping, he was demoted by one grade when he arrived in Beiping before being admitted to a famous high school. But in the second year of high school, he unfortunately failed two subjects and could not move up a class. The school has always been strict. If a student fails two subjects, they cannot move up a grade no matter what. Due to economic and age reasons, he could not afford to repeat a grade. However, the school was well-managed, and he was unwilling to leave the school. In this situation, he could not decide for himself and thought of returning home for the summer vacation to ask his father what to do. But he recalled the many difficulties and setbacks he had gone through to achieve his goal of coming here. Now that he cannot move up a grade, returning abruptly would mean that there would be no hope of coming back, and he would be criticized and have no face to see his father. Now he is in a dilemma and doesn't know what to do. He frowns all day long and is depressed. Knowing that you have great talent, I hope you will be happy to give me some guidance. I respectfully ask this, and wish you</p>
<p>Good health, Li Wenxiong</p>
<p>Answer: I think "your close friend" is really not worth it to be so decadent because he can't study at that school anymore. If you can't continue to study at that school, so be it. Is it necessary to be so troubled? Because the school is bad, you say that you can't study well in this kind of school, and you must change to another school. Because there is no opportunity to enter school, you say that you have no opportunity to study. These are all unpromising ideas and completely do not know what studying is all about. You must know that learning is something you have to pursue yourself. Having a school to enter certainly makes studying easier, but not having a school to enter does not mean there is no opportunity to study. As long as a person is willing to learn, they can create an environment for studying themselves. Edison is known to everyone. He did not enter any university, but he did succeed as a scientist. Of course, his research in science was more difficult and arduous than that of science university students, but because he was determined, he finally overcame those difficulties. Research in science requires experimental equipment. If I advise an ordinary person to study natural science on their own, they will definitely say, "I don't have the opportunity to go to school for experiments. Letting me study natural science on my own is just nice for you to say." But Edison at the beginning did not stop his ambition because of this difficulty. He just thought of a way to overcome it. If there was no experimental equipment, he would live a hard life and save money to buy some. So I think it is not necessary for your friend to be overly nostalgic and value the school. Not entering school cannot stop him from studying. I hope that he can seriously reflect on himself and see if there are any places where he has not worked hard and wasted energy in his past studies. If so, he must work harder and strive for improvement in the future. As for not being able to enter a certain famous high school again, or not being able to enter school, I think these are not a problem. We cannot treat ourselves as ducks, hoping to receive some "force-feeding" education. Studying is like a fish eating water in the water. You have to swim in the water and use your own mouth to absorb useful food.</p>

<p>— Written by Bulgarian Ivan Vazov, translated by Yang Sen</p>
<p>In the morning, Zuna went to the church very early. She took the franc given to her by Stoyan, bought candles, and lit one in front of every icon of St. He. When she came back, she seemed not as sad as before.</p>
<p>"Today is Christmas, so he will definitely come back... Holy Mary, send him back to me! My own dear angel... Lord Jesus, have mercy on me!"</p>
<p>Her daughter, Qina, reported that some people in the village had returned. The mother's face became even gloomier.</p>
<p>"Go welcome your brother, like the other girls," she said angrily to Qina.</p>
<p>"I want to go too, Mom," Radujo said, so the two children went to the snow-covered street, left the village market, and ventured onto the road. The mother stood at the door, waiting.</p>
<p>A blizzard blew down from the top of the mountain, and the valley and plain were all deeply covered with snow. A gloomy sky. A flock of crows flew over the road or perched on the tops of trees. On the road to Itihditing, there were black dots everywhere, representing the crowds waiting for the soldiers to arrive. These were all young girls, children, and old women. Because the soldiers were still coming constantly, some alone, some in groups of two or three. Qina and Radujo passed the first group of people, then the second group, and then the third group, standing far away on the road waiting. They wanted to be the first to see Stoyan. Although the falling snow almost blinded their eyes, they would immediately recognize him. The road stretched all the way to the small mountain and disappeared at that end. Qina and Radujo reached the top of the mountain, where the wind was even stronger, preventing them from moving forward. Two soldiers covered in snow walked past, but neither of them was Stoyan.</p>
<p>"Are there any more soldiers coming behind?" Qina asked.</p>
<p>"We don't know, children. Who are you waiting for?"</p>
<p>"Our brother." So the passersby walked past.</p>
<p>Qina still looked forward. She was cold and trembling, and Radujo was moaning, but her big brother was coming back. They had to greet him, otherwise their mother would be angry or cry.</p>
<p>Then they saw a carriage with two people inside, all dressed in warm clothes. Qina stood in front of the horse and stopped the carriage. "Sir, are there any soldiers behind you?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, my little dove," the man replied, half raising his leather hat and looking in surprise at the frozen little girl. So the carriage ran forward.</p>
