<h3>今後之西藏</h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>西藏爲我國西鄙之屏藩。川康青新之樞紐。得失存亡。關係絕鉅然自民國</p>
<p>元年第十三世達賴喇嘛由印回藏重握政權以還。中藏關係。向欠圓滿。去冬。達賴逝世。國人咸以爲解決西藏問題之良機已至。果能處置得當。則恢復治權。鞏固領土。良非難事。所可慮者。藏民篤信宗教。久而彌堅相傳第十三世達賴喇嘛。乃爲其所屬系統中之最後一世。圓寂後不在轉生。自宗喀巴大弟子報根巴迄今先後十三世。適當其數。此後繼承問題之解决。糾紛必多。現雖聞拉薩方面業經决定第十四世達賴之人選。而事屬秘密。究無以取信於人。在昔清社未屋。猶有所謂金奔巴瓶制度者。遇有活佛出世之互報差異者。則納籤瓶中。誦經降神。由駐藏大臣摯之。卽認爲眞達賴轉世。今並此而無之。殊無以折服全體藏民之心。自民元以來。西藏爲政教合一之邦。第十三世達賴。總攪大權。尤稱至尊無上。繼承問題不解决。藏局前途總含莫大之危機。可斷言也。</p>
<p>且卽謂第十四世達賴業經出世。其當選之資格。亦經確定。則依據西藏制度。亦須至二十歲成人時。始能就正式教主之職。在此二十年之過渡期間。不得不有人代攝政事。去冬達賴死後。全藏政務卽由藏王（司倫）名堯杞冷清者攝理。（司倫）爲人。精明强幹。思想則與達賴喇嘛仿佛。雖不謂爲絕對排華要亦與我無甚好感。本年二月杪。忽有西藏僧俗官民工學結澤熱振呼圖克圖代攝藏政之消息國府已照准加封。由此乃見藏中政局。必曾發生變化。惟道途遼遠。真相難明耳。結澤之爲人姑不論。而攝政政府之軍事將領。多屬留英學生乃爲事實。若輩之親英色彩。向稱濃厚。其領袖龍蝦總司令且隱然爲英人勢力之先導焉。幸而消息傳來。本年五月。龍蝦之陰謀暴露。伏罪而死。至是中藏關係。始有驟見接近之望。</p>
<p>凡明藏局內幕者。莫不知有三大派之存在。第一爲達賴派。第二爲班禪派。第三爲中立派。中立派之態度。不值討論。蓋皆無權之僧俗耳。達賴派之下。復有保守系與親英系之分。保守系獨樹一幟。與世無忤。親英系因龍蝦之被誅。一時或亦不敢　行跋巵。班禪派偏向親華與前藏哲邦（德𧶘綳）。色拉·甘丹（噶爾丹）三大寺之親華派。素有淵源本年初。三大寺代表赴中央情願。要求五事。其大要則爲護送班禪回藏。驅除宵小。改良政治。三大寺在政治宗教雙方之勢力。不可輕侮。（猶○二十年間達賴大舉進攻青海西康失敗。曾下普遍徴兵之令。不料爲三大寺反對。不得不離拉薩出走。卒乃表示屈服。驅逐主戰之親信而後已。）今班禪得其擁護而入藏。自可方便不少。且據喇嘛敎義達賴班禪。易世互相爲師。假令第十四世達賴已有其人。則班禪入藏。當居師傅之尊。政權縱握「司倫」或結澤熱振之手。而教權則固非班禪莫屬。在西藏之宗教勢力。可以支配政治。卽班禪亦云。解決藏事。須以宗教推進政治。若然。則班禪回藏。將使中藏關係發生長足之進展。當非奢望也。</p>
<p>茲者逗遛京滬。之班禪已北上矣。事前。有先往青海宣化秋後回藏之說。國府派往致祭達賴專使之黃慕松。亦已渡過金沙江。距離拉薩不遠。是則藏。局轉機之朕兆已見。固屬可信。惟西藏問題爲廿年來之主要○案。錯綜複雜。不可究結。以如此重大之問題。派員羈縻。固屬徒勞。操之過切。反恐債事。護送班禪回藏。業爲既定方針。總須促其實現。固不帶論。而根本政策。則猶待决定。聞中央對此問題。迭經討論。大致在保留外交國防及國際通商等事之大權。其他政教問題。則仍由藏政府自行處理。復鑒於清季派兵入藏之失策。主張恢復駐藏長官辦事處。而不派兵。對於拉薩通成都青海之交通。則擬趕速完成。在當今。環境之下。凡此原則。自爲吾人所贊同。惟問實行如何耳。英人勢力。籠罩全藏。歷有年所。舉凡郵電林礦金融交通軍事警察等端。莫不爲其所操縱。卽日俄兩國之潛勢力。亦有相當之點綴。（卽如西藏軍旗。卽由日人青木文教所測繪者。）環顧他人方着我先鞭。繼績進佔。若吾計劃。仍徒託空言。不知實行。竊恐良機難再。稍縱卽逝耳。�</p>

<h3>巴爾都外交成功　英法談話結束　安全計劃獲英贊助　英不反對俄入國聯　法海長留倫敦商海軍問題</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英法談話今日正式結束、公報宣稱、談話結果完全滿意云、英外相西門與法外長巴爾都及兩國政府其他重要官員所討論之範圍甚廣、今日此間發表官報稱、英法兩國外長之友誼談話、已於今晨在外部結束、此項討論能使兩國政府更瞭解彼此對於各問題之意見、所討論之問題如下、</p>
<p>（一）法國建議增進東歐之相互安全、（二）軍縮會議之前途、（三）一九三五年海軍會議之籌備、</p>
<p>法國海長皮特利將爲海軍聞題多留倫敦數日、（十日國民電）　　（倫敦）英法兩國閣員日來舉行談話以後、吾人倘欲明瞭其結果、則可概述如下、</p>
<p>（一）英國對於互助公約之成見、業已消除、互助公約已獲英內閣之贊助、（二）在有關係各國國都、凡爲英國勢力所能及者、英國均顧設法使其贊助互助公約、</p>
<p>（三）英國不反對蘇聯加入國聯、</p>
<p>（四）英法關係已見鞏固、雙方信仰已見增加、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）法國外長巴爾都於本日午後四點三十分離倫敦、啟程之前、曾會晤軍縮會議及海軍預備談話美國代表台維斯、有所商談、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）法外長巴爾都之來倫敦、各界多信其目的乃在謀獲英國之一言、即如他日不幸法國與德開戰、則英國顧仍助法是、惟巴氏本人則否認此說、今日英外相西門與巴氏會談後、旋發出公報、謂談話之性質、非常和諧、當時曾交換關於兩國在歐利害相共諸問題之意見、午後績開談話、法海長皮特利與英海相亦在海軍部會晤考慮海軍會議籌備事宜云云、（九日路透社電）</p>
<h3>解釋安全　英國疑雲消釋</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今晨英法兩國代表全體會議、歷時三小時始畢、現經徴實、英法兩國關於「東歐互助公約」之計劃、意見已趨一致、按軍縮會議安全委員會、曾於日前通過該委員會主席玻里的斯所提出之决議案、主張各國根據羅卡洛條約、及巴爾幹公約、分頭訂立區域互助公約、以相互保障安全、此項决議案、足以供給此次英法兩國閣員討論之根據、且與法國之提議、以强有力之後援、英法兩國閣員意見趨於一致、實力賴之、厥後討論海軍及空軍問題、亦與此問題有連帶關係、此次交換意見、雖頗爲深入、但仍以涉及大體爲限、足見英法兩國顧慮完全相同、以是關於保障和平所用之方式、兩國亦𩔖能一�</p>
<p>致、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據小巴黎人報駐倫敦訪員電稱、法外長巴爾都向英國當局解釋法國政策之後、英政府疑慮多已消釋、又謂此種政策、以友善態度考慮之、斷無不能了解之理、英國方面之力求了解、以及東方羅卡洛條約計畫、以後不惟不患英國之反對、且並不患英國之漠視、乃自然之理、毫不足異、惟英國贊成此項計畫能至如何程度、以及實際上英國將以如何形式予以贊成、此時尙不易言耳、日報載稱、（昨日談話親切而懇摯、）又稱、英法兩國皆欲鞏固和平、不日吾人將見兩國國交愈益親近、而與和平政策大有裨益也、巴黎○聲固和平、不日吾人將見兩國國交意見大致可歸納如下、即（一）互助公約之新計畫、英國將不參加、（二）互助公約與羅卡洛條約不易調和一層、英國未必堅持己見、（三）英國對於法俄之接近、原極憂慮、自經巴爾都解釋之後、英當局已承認吾人用意、在於穩定歐陸時局而無他慮矣、（四）因上述理由、英國對於互助公約計畫、保持好意旁觀態度云云、要之昨日英法兩國閣員談話結果、極為滿意、報界方面初不望其能如是之速也、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英所繫念　維持中立原則</h3>
<p>（倫敦）本日正午英政府宴請法外長巴爾都及海長皮特利、彼此懇談至爲歡洽、席間並未發表演說、午後三時三十分兩國代表在外交部重行談話、兩國外交部長交換關於歐洲問題之意見、法海長皮特利與英海相孟珊而則討論海軍會議籌備事宜、今日之談話、於六時三十分完畢、以後仍將舉行會晤、法外長巴爾都會將該國所主張之區域協定之性質及目的、逐一說明、一般人相信此種政策、已得英國完全贊同、在最近之將來、英政府向各關係國政府說明英國贊助法國之政策、亦屬可能、但此並非謂英國提供某種新諾言、法國代表並不以此期待於英國、其所望於倫敦者、不過欲其對於法國穩定歐洲之志願、予以明白贊同耳、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今晚此間傳說、法外長巴爾都與英國代表會晤時、雙方均特別注意於互助條約計畫、其中歐洲東北區域互助條約、曾經從長研究此項條約、係以現正進行之波蘿的海沿岸各國互助公約爲　形、將包括法國·波蘭及蘇俄各國、而英國不在其內、至於另訂地中海區域公約以資補充一層、似尙未共同討論、英國閣員所特別繫念者、厥爲倫敦方面所謂之「中立原則、」據英方消息、上項互助條約、即以此項原則爲依歸、吾人相信巴爾都對於英國方面已與以必要之慰貼、緣英國閣員對於法國締結互助條約之主張、畢竟予以贊同故也、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法國外長　訪問軍縮主席</h3>
<p>（倫敦）法國外長巴爾都與法國國聯會事務局主任瑪西格里、於今晨同赴軍縮會議主席漢特森之住宅、與漢特森有所會商、上午十點半後、巴爾都復偕法國駐英大使格爾平及外交部秘書長雷瑞、同至外交部、未幾法國海軍部長庇特利亦至、與外相西門·掌○大臣艾登·重行談話、在談話前、雷瑞曾在首相邸與外部常務次·官汪西泰作預備談話、今晨談話範圍、似專屬關於軍縮之各項問題、至於以互助公約保障安全之問題、則大部份已於昨日會晤時加以商談、於今午代理首相包爾溫宴請法國閣員時、方再加以討論、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>海長留英　商討海軍問題　要求擴大會議範圍　　法方聲明並無此意</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據可靠方面聲稱、今日後後會商後、法國海長皮特利已决於巴爾都外長星期二離英之後、尙須在倫敦勾留數日、皮氏延長留英日期之消息發表、解釋者以爲係表示皮氏與英國海軍大臣孟賽爾已决定對於明年之海軍會議、尙須從長、討論、雖意大利最近宣布之建造三萬五千噸新戰鬥艦二艘計畫、已使會議前途更形困難、亦所不計云、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）海軍發表公報、內稱今晨某日報、載稱法國政府有意要求將一五三五年海軍會議範圍擴大、使多數國家均能參加、該報並稱、海軍部長皮特利主張由現在起、即應准許德國參加某種談話云、此種消息、全爲無稽之談、因海軍部局從未作此種宣言故也、特此聲明云云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日新閣集全力　應付海軍會議　增派岩下大佐赴英</h3>
<p>（東京）廣田外相鑑於倫敦初步談判、將由今秋開始具體的討論、與專注力該談判、聞將努力解決中東路問題、而要求俄方提出最後的讓步案、如在短期間內未能獲得解决頭緒、即將置之不理、任關東軍策動、（十日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）政府以今後倫敦之海軍軍縮預備交涉、實與時局關係重大、故决定添派海軍大佐岩下氏渡英、以便輔佐松平大使、而岩下大佐所携去之政府訓令、及對於出席該項會議之秘策、亦有充分商妥之必要、因此大角海相於十日閣議散會後、與廣田外相商議良久、决計將該項應付辦法、完全使岩下大佐轉達松平大使、以便對於預備交涉不致稍有遺誤、（十日日聯電）</p>

<h3>英法報紙　譏誚赫斯宣言　危言外患轉移國人視綫　不啻馬克安多一紙祭文</h3>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報對於希特勒代表赫斯前日發表之宣言、毫不驚異、而發表下列意見、（赫斯之演說與馬克安多爲羅馬凱撒大帝所作之祭文、同等巧妙、（按馬克安多爲紀元前八十年至三十年間人與凱撒大帝相友善、）自表面觀之、似有同樣效力、赫斯演說對於人人所欲了解之事、並未加以說明、僅以張大之詞、稱贊希特勒以如何嚴厲如何堅决之手段、防止亂萌而已、實則此等事實、孰不知之、固無煩赫氏爲之陳說、又况此等事實、頗有互相矛盾之處乎、赫氏一再以愛國之語、激動聽衆、使聞者惑於愛國之言、而忘却六月卅日之事變、並於演說將終之時、轉向法國主張與之諒解、吾人當知一國暴戾之當局、遇國內政局不穩時、當對人民詭稱外敵將臨、以轉移視線、而消弭內部之紛爭、此即赫斯演說之意義也、吾輩外人惟有潛心觀察德國之事變、以待德國人心理之恢復常態」云云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據路透巴黎訪電稱、希特勒之親信希斯氏在東普魯士邦柯尼斯堡國社黨大會演說、謂德國所期望者、僅爲和平德國願與法國敦睦邦交云云、巴黎政治視察家皆以爲希氏之發此種言論、殆因欲使國人遺忘近今清黨之事變、及因巴爾都刻在倫敦活動之故、巴黎各報皆疑及希斯氏之誠意、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）自星期日管理國社會黨黨務之閣員赫斯在康尼斯堡發表演說後、法國全國報紙俱已儘量登載、並以各報標題而論、則赫斯氏之言論似出於法人意料之外者云、如晨報之標題如下、「赫斯對於德法携手之請求」、該報之柏林記者稱、赫斯演說中最可注意之點、即爲其中許多見解、顯係希特勒或其左右所授意、且赫斯言詞中一種願與法國成立新關係之懇切志願、亦屬極爲顯明云、法國參謀部之機關報巴黎迴聲報關於此事之標題則如下、「德國究何所欲、赫斯氏和平主義之大演講、德國部長向參戰軍人呼籲和平」、勝利報之標題則爲「希特勒之親信直接向法國致詞、可驚之演說其目的之爲欲轉移人民對於國內政局之目光、實無可疑云」、巴黎日報之論調則「法人不宜不靜聆此種熱誠之言、吾人俱覺德法聯盟大有價值、但惜德國並未先使吾等相信此種聯盟之可能、而僅告吾人聯盟之種種之益云」、復有民友報者、則謂「豈赫斯自信法國將以武力侵入德國乎、法國之參戰軍士當然深知德人實勇敢之戰鬭者、但除去此種戰場上憶念、或者猶可使兩國民族携手之外、實尙有其他事蹟可使萊茵河畔二大民族不得忘懷者在」云云、（九日民國電）</p>
<h3>國社黨變更政策歟　公然視戰爭可畏</h3>
<p>（柏林）代表希特勒管理國社黨黨務之不管部閣員赫斯昨日演說、在外國引起之反響、德國報紙紛紛指出、惟此項演說、表示國社黨政策已變更方針、而在德國內部亦引起輿論之驚異及震動、此層德國報紙則未○言及、德報又謂希特勒自</p>
<p>最近政變之後、頗爲疲勞、大約將暫時休息、外交通訊報謂國社主義截至目下止、所以未能以和平見信於人者、實馬克斯主義各叛逆之罪、至於目下、則國社黨願對各國證明其酷愛和平之誠意云、又戰爭之慘狀、在今以前、國社黨禁止言及、現則報紙對戰禍之可畏、亦公然言之矣、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（柏林）普邦總理兼航空部長戈林將軍之特別黑衣衛隊、今日担任柏林北面渥拉軍堡政治犯收容所之守衛事宜、以代原有褐衫衛隊、此事殆與外傳該收容所現覊禁褐衫軍人數百人之傳說有關、聞被覊者有參與已被槍决挺進隊領袖羅赫木陰謀之嫌疑、（九日路透電）</p>

<p>拉達維亞京城立陶宛報紙登載華沙傳來消息、謂波蘭政界、似可承認以自治權畀於波立兩國爭執之維爾那地方、但立陶宛認此種建議、仍不充足、已予以拒絕、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>波蘭政府　解散泛繫團體</h3>

<h3>美国復興費浩大　總計竟達百三十餘萬萬元　每日約二千五百萬元　經濟衰落厄運已打破</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）財部今日第一次公布復興運動所費欵項之數字、總計竟達美金一三·一一五·五三五·二二一元之鉅、去夏以來、用欵速度卽日益增加、至去年十二月中、每日竟達二千五百萬元、惟至今春復漸減少、故至六月三十日經濟年度結束之時、所有救濟欵項之支出、較之羅斯福總統原來預算之數、尙不足遠甚、與政府表示同情者以爲用欵减少、係因需要亦已减少、證明新政已打破經濟衰落之厄運、然批評者則謂政府無非利用復興欵項、以爲政治上之便利、現在稍留餘欵、以備於十一月中國會改選之前、再大事鋪張、惟無論原因如何、據今日發表之數字、則財部因用欵稍緩、現在尙有餘額六·六七</p>
<p>〇·六七五·四〇五元、與財部公布同時發表者、尙有復興行政處主任約翰森之宣言、聲稱該處自一九三二年二月起、貸與各業以謀振興之總數、爲五·五三八·〇七一·四二九元、惟此項鉅欵現以陸續收回、每日約可收回三佰萬元、擁護政府者、對於此亦認爲係羅斯福政策已收實效之明證、復興行政處之支出項下有前總統胡佛時三十萬萬元、亦在其內、政府發言人今日表示、謂復興計劃當仍積極進行、惟以各業現已大有進步、故財部所存餘欵、或可不必全數動用云、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）政府農產報告今日發表、稱美國今年植棉畝數爲一九零五年以來最少之數、惟所减雖多、收穫將尙有過剩、故或將實行朋克海案之辦法、農部報告估</p>
<p>計七月一日植棉之地總數計爲二八·〇二四·〇〇〇英畝、去年同日爲四〇·八五二·〇〇〇英畝、如以已往五年每畝產棉之平均計算、則今年產額將超過一千萬擔、卽朋克海案限制之數、農業整理委員會原擬限制今年植棉農地至三千六百萬畝、現在已超過二百萬畝、故預料收穫之時、凡植棉者超過限額、皆須繳納朋克海案所定之特稅也、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>菲律濱選舉　製憲會議代表　七月三十日開會　　獨立行動第一步</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）在美國指導下新建菲律濱共和國之初步工作將於明日肇始、屆時將選舉憲法會議、代表二百零二人、起草菲律濱共和國憲法、憲法將有摩斐總督於七月三十日召集、在馬尼拉開會、美國會所通過之菲島獨立案規定憲法會議應於一九三四年十月一日以前成立、而菲島之獨立領袖則决定提早舉行、最初本定六月二十六日選舉憲法會議代表、俾於七月四日美國獨立紀念日召開憲法會議、但受新發展之影響、遂將選舉稍爲延期、此次選舉爲近七星期內震動菲島之第二次選舉、六月五日曾選舉國會議員、國會議員定於七月十六日開會、此項選舉之結果更足證實奎松之勢力、奎松爲獨立奪門之參院議長、並爲派赴華盛頓要求獨立之代表團領袖、大多數競選國會議員之候選人、亦將參加憲法會議之競選、因兩次選舉並無衝突也、二百零二名代表分配辦法爲每選區選舉二人、代表必須具有候選衆議院議員之資格、會議時幷不支俸、但不受政府俸給之代表每次親自參加憲法會議時、可向政府支取五比沙及來回一次之川資、此項費用總共規定爲五十萬比沙、菲島憲法會議如一切憲法會議、爲臨時性質、但無絕對主權、蓋以憲法上之若干限制遭經美國會通過之獨立案所規定也、共和政府將於完成獨立前之十年過渡期內統治菲島憲法告成後、卽將行使其權力、該項憲法將由菲島人民投票表决、並須經美國總統批准、菲島國家主義派雖希望於一九三五年一月一日成立共和政府、但此種希望恐難實現、因憲法會議如延長討論、或羅斯福總統否决憲法、則馬尼拉與華盛頓談判之周折將使此事展緩實現、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）完成菲島獨立之步驟如下、（一）一九三四年七月十日選舉憲法會議代表二百零二名、（二）一九三四年七月三十日憲法會議假座馬尼拉衆議院開會、（三）規定一九三六年三月二十四日完成憲法、並呈報美國總統、（四）美國總統批准憲法、但未特定時限、故大有展緩實行獨立之可能、（五）總統批准該憲法之四個月內送交菲律濱報票人表决、（六）如憲法通過、則於三十日內籌備選舉新政府、而於籌備後三月至六月之時期內舉行選舉、（七）自表决美國交還之憲法後、美總統將發表聲明、結束菲律濱之美國政府、菲律濱共和政府於焉成立、（八）共和政府成立後十年、美國卽退出菲島、共和國告成、（九日國民電）</p>

<h3>輪船停駛</h3>
<p>天旱酷熱、河水爲涸、内河較大之輪隻、早已完全停駛、行旅苦之、本市開往蘇州·無錫·常熟·崑山·湖州·盛澤·硤石·等處之小火輪、因河道較闊、本尙能勉强行駛、現據内河招商局消息、該局開往硤石之小火輪、因受天時酷熱之影響、水流低淺、因此不能行駛、故於前日起、暫行停駛、一俟河流水漲、再行恢復原有班期、至湖州·盛澤·震澤·等處、倘在最近數天内、仍無甘霖下降、則亦將繼續停止云、</p>
<h3>浦東旱象</h3>

<p>陳談余此次原無意北上、經董事會决議派余一行、故怱促啟程、上月二十三日抵津、晤見各方、當時所謂通車規程手續、雙方皆已辦妥、甚至路員制服證章、亦均製就、故到津以後、反覺無所事事、惟余當時見雙方已定規程、對於帳目問題、未列條文、於是即向當局建議、可否依萬國通車例、各段歸各人營業、雙方不結帳務、迫該主張提出後、日方即派一南滿職員山本到山海關、或方亦請張水淇前往商洽、結果經日方拒絕、同時查得該結帳問題、在本人未北上以前、雙方已經在山海關會商時口頭議妥、余以旣無問題、亦即轉往北平、外傳余在津召開技術等會議、統非信史、</p>
<h3>資本百萬係屬不確</h3>
<p>今談此結帳問題之前、余先將雙方情形説明、外傳通車資本、額定百萬兩、由日方觀光局、華方中國旅行社、各負其半、此亦完全不確、中國旅行社對此、僅用五萬元、况今關内外通車、原有此規模、與初辦不同、如關外叚與關内叚路徑遠近比較、相去祗幾公里、關外設十四站、關内十四站、山海關一站爲公同站、此均屬天成形勢、其他機車、以山海關作焦點、互不逾越、車輛關外由南滿抽二列、關内由北寗抽二列、在義務上可謂無分軒輊、故對資本、以旣有規模、又毌需此巨欵、</p>
<h3>不結帳目避免糾葛</h3>
<p>至言日方拒不結帳之原由、因防日後收支相差起見、而要求結帳、此其最顯著者、在余個人當時提出不必結帳、良以結帳以後、關内外之匯兑、决不能持平、且結帳需要算帳人手、尤以算帳方面易起誤會、難免將來不發糾葛、因此欲省却種種麻煩、故余當時有此主張也、</p>
<h3>不涉滿字誠屬難能</h3>
<p>總之東方旅行社已成立於山海關、平瀋亦已實行通車、雖第一次通車肇生不幸、燬車數輛、但即由北寗路彌補、繼續行駛、余北上僅一人、返亦一人、在此行之中、</p>
<p>並未有任何契約、經余簽署一字、前報載通車方案、經余簽署者、盡出謠傳、故今次通車實行、張水淇即奉派擔任東方旅行社經理職務、東方社組織、下設總務·帳務·營業·文書·四課、所用技術人員、全屬北寗舊員、今不得已而通車、固多便利日方之處、但北寗路當局而能在北情勢之下、交涉得、（一）通車談判、自始至終、對「滿洲國」三字、不提隻字、（二）東方旅行社、須向中國政府註册、（三）東方旅行社經理一職、永遠華人任命、交涉得此結果、亦屬難能矣、</p>
<h3>第五批　現銀運往英印　共計一百五十萬兩</h3>
<p>上海現銀出口、最近一個餘月、已經有四批運出、其中三批、裝往英印、一批運至美國、先後出口現銀及國幣、共有三千數百萬元、惟滬上洋商各銀行收買之現銀尙多、其未經報運出口者、茲正在陸續裝船、昨日、第五批現銀、由本埠安達·大英·等四家外國銀行所收買而運赴英印者、全部均爲銀寳、每枚重五十兩者、多由長江上游及河南等處購集到滬、時日先裝三百箱出口、計一百五十萬兩、係運往倫敦與孟買兩埠、交大英公司郵船賴乾浦得那號運出、各銀行運銀至海關碼頭上駁、轉入郵船時、派有武裝警捕保護、下午二時、該銀已由英輪載離上海、而赴英印矣、據確切消息、尙有第六批巨額現銀、本月内將赶運出國、</p>
<h3>華茶輸俄减少　印錫及日茶競爭甚烈　國人亟宜注意及改善</h3>
<p>中央社云、據國際貿易局指導處主任季澤晋談、我國歷年來對俄重要輸出品、以荳·荳油·茶葉·爲大宗、中俄貿易、我國常處於出超地位、自九一八後、荳及荳油之輸出、已非我有、共結果將由出超而一變爲入超、今日之言對俄貿易者、僅爲茶葉一項耳、</p>
<h3>俄爲茶葉唯一市塲</h3>
<p>我國茶葉、向爲對外貿易中之大宗出口、年銷於非洲、及英美者、雖有巨額、但全部言之、以蘇俄爲第一、故華茶輸俄、不僅在中俄兩國貿易上居重要地位、卽以華茶輸出之國别而論、亦以蘇俄居首要、</p>
<h3>華茶不能暢銷原因</h3>
<p>蘇俄每年、在各國採購之茶葉、爲數至鉅、由我國輸入者僅半數而已、至於華茶在俄所以不能暢銷之原因、與在其他各國之情形相同、卽近年印度錫蘭及日本茶葉、突飛猛進、侵佔我國在國際市塲上之銷路、華茶輸俄中、除磚茶外、他如綠茶紅茶、均爲印錫及日本茶所奪取、自東北失地後、荳類輸出斷絕、而唯一之輸出品之茶、又處於不利地位、是誠對俄貿易上堪注意也、</p>
<h3>救濟華茶輸俄辦法</h3>
<p>俄人好飲茶、尤歡迎華茶、近來蘇俄在高加索一帶、試種茶葉、惟質量不佳、產量有限、仍仰給於國外、</p>
<p>據蘇俄海關統計、每年輸入茶葉一二萬噸、尙不足供全國銷費、祇以蘇俄對外貿易、爲國家壟斷、一切輸入、由其支配而受限制、我國對俄輸出之茶葉、苟能將蘇俄全國市塲上所用之茶葉、均由吾國供給、則大可償荳類輸出减少之損失而有餘、查華茶輸俄衰落之原因、固有多端、惟蘇俄因向其他各國購貨、尙有賒賬辦法、吾國茶商資本不足、向無賒賬辦法、於是蘇俄舍華而轉向條件優越之國家購進、此實爲華茶輸俄之大障礙、願我國人加以注意焉、</p>

<h3>翻戲黨大肆活躍　同昌雜貨店經理執迷不悟　一再做莊搖攤致輸去鉅金</h3>
<p>以賭騙錢、向名翻戲、此項翻戲黨、海上從未絕跡、該黨組織、頗爲嚴密、並有黨魁領導行騙、年前因犯擄人勒贖案業經伏誅之　伸平、曾充該黨領袖甚久、自　死後、據個中人之意、紹興小張資格尙深、似有受黨徒推戴之希望、惟小張近年以還、屢屢失風、上月猶因嘔把（即吐回騙欵之術語）冲突、竟至涉訟、故刻下已稍歛跡、小張之外、則甬人王理中、亦屬騙帮中之佼佼者、王業此有年、滬甬兩地之受騙男女、實繁有徒、　曾在滬一度失風、被捕房拘解第一特區地方法院、判處徒刑四年、旋逢大赦、减短</p>
<h3>牢獄生活</h3>
<p>期間不少、但其釋後、終以欺騙易爲、且能坐而較富、寗干法紀、不欲改圖、故不久又去甬江、騙得婦人徐吳氏鉅欵、迨該婦覺悟、而其已潛逃來滬、最近該婦聞悉其匿跡滬濱、追踵而至、暫寓東方飯店、一面投捕房報告、請求查緝、乃天網恢恢、至前日則因另一騙案而被逮捕矣、緣王理中於旬日之前、與其黨羽、訪知小東門大生弄十二號同昌雜貨店經理閩人鮑錦泰、頗有資財、且喜賭博、乃命其黨徒中之閩籍鄭姓者兩人、於七月三日同赴同昌訪鮑、相晤之下、兩鄭姓者自謂彼輩向在</p>
<h3>香港經營</h3>
<p>雜貨業、今係伴同店主楊某來滬辦貨、寄寓天津路大上海飯店五百十三號房閒、主人有友端某、請與君亦稱莫逆、特介紹向寳號採購、頃奉主命造訪、如不嫌交易微細、敢煩於明日午前十一時下顧敝寓、與敝居停接洽云云、鮑雖與二鄭素眛平生、然旣知屬同鄉、復有友人作介、且所商爲生意買賣、遂欣然諾之、翌晨、鮑如約前往、及入該室、由兩鄭殷懃招待、談次鮑詢其主何在、　鄭即稱主夙嗜賭、</p>
<p>到滬後連宵皆與友博、刻尙在他室高臥未興、並絮絮自言其主喜賭之情狀、謂主固港中富商、</p>
<h3>揮金如土</h3>
<p>茲已輸去三千之鉅、仍毫不在意、鮑聞之始則嘖嘖稱羨、稽露　技癢狀、兩鄭料將入彀、乃向之曰、吾儕同鄉、應相互助、主人好賭而不精、擲金錢如虚牝、吾儕不妨合作、稍試勝算、可操左劵、苟或有意、須於午後二時、携千金前來入局、鮑即允歸、届時果去所、</p>
<p>謂主人楊某（即王理中）者、已在室爲搖攤之賭、惟輸贏殊微、見鮑至、衆咸推之做莊、兩鄭以與</p>
<p>鮑有前約、亦取鈔幣一千八百元與鮑之千金合併、王則從篋内取鈔票一巨束、謂數有一萬元、鮑旣爲莊家、遂以籌碼十二支、權充賭具、分一·二·三·四等門、任令</p>
<h3>猜度下注</h3>
<p>迨局終結算、莊家輸四千三百元、餘現現鈔一千元外、尙欠三千三百元、兩鄭當　鮑不必介意、容再翻本、故次日鮑又携鈔幣五百元往、仍爲莊家、因昨日賭至中途、籌盋忽失少一支、是日乃改以紐扣十二枚爲賭具、猜法悉與初次相同、但結果鮑又輸三千元、餘所帶之欵外、負債二千五百元、婦奇者、是日賭至半途、紐扣亦少一枚、而兩日來之最大孤注、皆以「三」門爲重、此中弊端、明眼人早可窺破、但鮑身處局中、且輸鉅數、致更糊塗、當時唯知如何</p>
<h3>設法挽回</h3>
<p>而若輩兩日所得猶不以爲足、復約其七日續賭、鮑歸後偶以所遭之事語人、人皆謂其遇騙、鮑始恍然、前日特往交勢、欲索回損失、王等不理、鮑乃報告老閘捕房、派探卜宗庭往將王理中拿獲、至兩鄭姓則已逃逸、昨晨、解送第一特區地方法院、捕房律師張竹陳述案情後詹推事訊之被告、供認串騙不諱、並稱兩鄭姓之踪跡、可向沈孝祥律師查詢、或能明瞭等語、庭上遂諭被告收押、改期再訊、</p>
<p>、若緩刑期内不再犯法、則所科刑期、自可免予執行、詎猶稱不服、遂上訴於最高法院、近由該院吊卷、審核之下、以爲尙有疑點、將案發回高二分院、更爲審判、於是重复傳集人證、再行審理、昨晨宣判、葉山濤行使僞造文書、處徒刑三月、緩刑二年、雖所定罪名、較前似微有出入、而所科刑期、則無變更也、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>科學的實際效用　—答言普君—</h3>
<p>言普君對於學社會科學的實際效用發生了懷疑，他以爲我們現在讀書是和前淸時候一樣，爲的要解决生活問題。然而學社會科學並不能爲我們解决生活問題，我們爲什麽要學它？並且書籍也很難買，就要學也很不容易，這也是個難題。這疑惑，我們覺得一定不只言普君一人才有，很多人都會感到的。</p>
<p>首先我們要説，言普君把社會科學與前淸時候的讀書看成同樣的東西，是一個很大的錯誤。前淸時候的讀書，是要學到一種歌功頌德的目的。社會是怎樣，世界是怎樣，讀書人都管不着。自然，這在許多讀書人看來，個人的生活是不但可以解决，而且會弄得很好的。然就整個的中國社會來説，民衆是一天比一天愚蠢無能，列强的侵略，竟不知道怎樣抵抗。把中國弄成了半殖民地，社會崩潰，經濟破產，廣大的人民生活没有出路。這都是當時讀書人把自己眼睛蒙着，只顧盲目地走向升官發財的路上去的結果。現在可不同了，我們所以要學社會科學，爲的是要使我們眼睛看得淸楚，使我們能明白地了解這複雜的世界。不但要令我們個人明白，而且要使大衆也睜開眼睛。近來閙得很利害的大衆語運動，其最後目的也不外就是要使大衆能够接近科學，認識世界（未完）</p>

<h3>第一章　握拍法的重要</h3>
<p>網球家所採用的幾種方式是習於良好的姿勢並且含有固定的原則</p>
<p>網球技術的成功、原没有坦易的道路、很少捷徑可等、果欲求精、必如期他苦練的男女球員一樣、下過一番苦工、才能成就、</p>
<p>細微末節的地方、初學者每不留意、以爲無關緊要、但是球藝的基礎、就是根據此種原素、未入門徑的人、以爲任何方法握拍、似乎没有區别、若是他偶然採用一種握法還擊來球時、竟將球擊　網去、此種成功、就使他認爲選擇得當、實在是絕大的錯誤、</p>
<p>不拘何種握法、雖然間或也可以成功、但是選擇了最好的握法、那就在拍擊的時候、有效的多而失誤的少、所以由長久經騐得來的幾種固定握法、在大多數球員手中應用時、都已產生了成功的拍擊、</p>
<p>擊球時、使用球拍要絕對的自如、球的反　是難規定的、所以要應付意外的反躍時、不要因所立的地位而感受困難、此種困難、不管是網球名手、亦不能免的、雖然他們對於球的飛程、曲綫、或躍力、都能凖　推測出來、然而也時常被龜虎在受困的地位、去拍來球的、</p>
<p>當球反躍到身邊較所預料的略近時、要應付此種困難、當然將手臂向身邊靠緊、但是拍面的角度、就自然的改變、此時要也改變握法、是决來不及的、所以預先選定的握法、對於應付無規定的來球、必定要是一種極易改變的、</p>
<p>現今各派的球員、仍然採用不同的握法、這大槪是因爲各球員練習球藝時的情况不同、在此種遊戲發源地的英國、球塲大半設在草地、草地上球的反躍力、較之他國硬地的球塲、當然是低弱得多、</p>
<p>所以英國的標凖握法、是要球員將球拍放低至球的底下、把低躍的球擊過網去、於是英國人的握法、是略在球拍的前方、把拍面向後斜着、擊球時從球底削去、略爲高舉球的飛程、</p>
<p>美國所用的球塲在硬地、球的反躍力較高、所以握法也就不同、在太平洋沿岸、往日球塲大都用煤渣舖的、握法於是就極端的更變、採用所謂「西方」握法、去應付從極硬的塲面上所發生極高度的球躍、美國加州人Ｃａｉｉｆｏｒｔｉａｎｓ爲謀拍擊此種高躍的球、將手向後方及柄下移轉、</p>
<p>球員若採用這兩種絕對不同的握法中的任何一種——英國式或西方式、遇到不能使用這一種握法的球塲時、就要發生困難、所以最好採用折中的方式、在遇到任何情况的時候、都不感困難、這些「東方」握法、比其他特殊的握拍方法、拍擊所產生的結果、是較少崎形、並且較爲穩當、在初學網球的時候、有一點是特别要注意的、就是任何一網球家的成功、即使他是錦標人才、他使用的方法、未必就是最好的、有的球員的成功、甚至於是採用最不穩當的方法、而勝過他的缺點、但是這樣同一的方式、到了平常的球員手裏、就恐不能產生同一效果、甚至簡直不同、所以從多年的研究和錦標賽中實地得來的經騐告訴我們、惟有由大多數身材氣質體力不同力的不同的球員、採手的一種技能、才是最穩當球藝、初學者斷不可存崇拜偶像的、不要見鐵爾登Ｔｉｌｄｅｎ跑時最神奇的拍擊、林倫夫人因Ｍｌｌｅ　Ｌｅｎｇｌｅｎ雙脚騰空的殺球、或李却士Ｒｉｃｂａｒｄ脚立在極因難的地位、還能拍擊有效、就傾心仰慕初學者學他們一百次决没有一次有同樣效果的機會、若是採用穩當的方法、那麽十之八九、定能獲得較良的效果、這是很明顯的、若是鐵爾登在他的神奇拍擊以前、有停步的時間、則他的失球機會、必更少、若是林倫夫人能脚踏實地去殺球、他殺球的效力必更大、若是李却士能改良作的慣常擊球的方式、脚立在得當的地位去擊球、他的球藝、必較今日更好、</p>

<h3>「徹底」的底子</h3>
<p>— 公汗</p>
<p>現在對於一個人的立論，如果説牠是「高超」，恐怕有些要招論者的反感了，但若説牠是「徹底」，是「非常前進」，却似乎還没有什麽。</p>
<p>現在也正是「徹底」的，「非常前進」的議論，替代了「高超」的時光。</p>
<p>文藝本來都有一個對象的界限。譬如文學，原是以懂得文字的讀者爲對象的，懂得文字的多少有不同，文章當然要有深淺。而主張用字要平常，作文要明白，自然也還是作者的本分。但這時「徹底」論者站出來了，他説中國有許多文盲，問你怎麽辦？這實在是對於文學家的當頭一棍，只好立刻悶死給他看。</p>
<p>不過還可以另外請一枝救兵來，也就是辯解。因爲文盲是已經在文學作用的範圍之外的了，這時只好請畫家，演劇家，電影作家出馬，給他看文字以外的形象的東西。然而這還不足以塞「徹底」論者的嘴的，他就説文盲中還有色盲，有瞎子，問你怎麽辦？於是藝術家們也著了當頭一棍，只好立刻悶死給他看。</p>
<p>那麽，作爲最後的掙扎，説是對於色盲瞎子之類，須用講演，唱歌，説書罷。説是也説得過去的。然而他就要問你：莫非你忘記了中國還有聾子嗎？</p>
<p>又是當頭一棍，悶死，都悶死了。</p>
<p>於是「徹底」論者就得到一個結論：現在的一切文藝，全都無用，非徹底改革不可！</p>
<p>他立定了這個結論之後，不知道到那里去了。誰來「徹底」改革呢？那自然是文藝家。然而文藝家又是不「徹底」的多，於是中國就氷遠没有對於文盲，色盲，瞎子，聾子，無不有效的—「徹底」的好的文藝。</p>
<p>但「徹底」論者却有時又會伸出頭來責備一頓文藝家。</p>
<p>弄文藝的人，如果遇見這樣的大人物而不能撕掉他的鬼臉，那麽，文藝不但不會前進，並且只會萎縮，終於被他消滅的。切實的文藝家必須認淸這一種「徹底」論者的眞面目！</p>
<p>甲：某人是靠賴人家的汗液過活，</p>
<p>乙：那末他是不是一個剝削者呢？</p>
<p>甲：不，他是一個土耳其浴室的老闆。</p>
<h3>中午</h3>
<p>— 林熙</p>
<p>眼看着太陽走上中天，</p>
<p>帶着累積的疲勞，</p>
<p>也該在茅簷前歇歇了。</p>
<p>思量着，思量着怎樣度過秋天，</p>
<p>把希望都交給</p>
<p>乖乖地在炎日下伏着的莊稼。</p>
<p>白楊不再吵了，</p>
<p>聽佈穀鳥那麽沉悶地</p>
<p>—佈瑴，佈穀。</p>
<p>聽拉長了　子的那麽一聲聲沉悶的咿喔，看榆樹上的毛蟲埀下來，埀下來，</p>
<p>連旱烟吸來也都是懶懶地。</p>
<h3>吉長綫上</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>一説到吉長路，就聯想到平津路，因爲地理上告訴我們説這兩路的長度是相等的，都是二百四十里。</p>
<p>這條路雖然路綫不長，營業却是不惡，從山東家上來的苦力們到吉林東南山溝去開荒，或是東南山溝的人到省裏西北部去，一定要坐這路的火車。吉海綫，照理可以奪去大連來的轉入東南山溝的乘客，但由於路軌時常中斷，人人都裹足不坐，寗願捨近求遠。去年拉濱路（吉敦路拉法站到哈爾濱）修成，想來吉長路要受相當影響减少一些乘客的；從東南山溝往哈爾濱等地去的人們不要再經吉林，長春等地轉折了。</p>
<p>這條拉濱路，是日本帝國主義從延邊伸入北滿的一枝利箭，它的要點在控制蘇俄，便利軍運。</p>
<p>吉長路的車輛，和南滿車一樣，不過稍舊些，從前就聽説這都是南滿路不用的舊車，被我們的鐵路局買了過來。舊也没有關係，只是車中及不上南滿車那樣乾凈。</p>
<p>營城子車站附近，有一個火石嶺子煤礦，是由前吉林省政府開採的，煤層很厚，煤質也好，現在也歸到日本人的手裏去。這煤礦，前年曾經有些工人殺死工頭加入義勇軍去抗日的。</p>
<p>土門嶺車站附近有個土門嶺，在嶺下開了一個山洞，火車通過時，約須三分鐘，這一帶地方多山，但没有什麽好風景土門嶺站是全路有名的車站，不過並不是由於車站大，其實這裏只是一個小站，出名原因第一因爲有個小山洞，第二因爲肉包子。火車一進站，還不等停好，一些賣包子的鄉下人就大聲呌喊着，乘客也很願意在這項食物上化費幾個錢，不過是，説起來還是陳舊的包子多，新的包子少，騰騰熱氣正不知是蒸過第幾次了。還有人説肉餡是些死猪肉的。</p>
<p>松花江，在九站車站旁邊流過去，這裏有些木廠，還有一個石山，木廠是作着木材生意的，從江上解下木筏，運到站上再裝車載到别處。至於石山，對於東北新鐵路的興修上，是立了不少功績。天天都有一些敲石子的工人依着這石山生活。</p>
<p>路兩旁，也不許種植高梁，車站上，也是結着鐵絲網，堆着沙袋，防備意外。</p>
<p>吉長車上化用的錢是吉林大洋，吉林官帖，哈長車上只化哈大洋，南滿車化的是金票，奉票雖然能用，却少有人拿出來，跌價跌得太不値錢了。東北幣制的不統一，給與旅客莫大的困苦。</p>
<p>現在聽説滿洲國把幣制完全統一了，自然這是一件好事，但這是誰的功勞呢？這裏面不是還有别的作用麽？</p>
<p>驛馬河上，有一個鐵橋，然而這不是大工程，前年夏天吉長路一度中斷，就由於鐵橋被炸的原故。我想，這還値得在篇後提上一提。</p>
<h3>隨感</h3>
<p>— 叔靈</p>
<p>有一次，一個人詢問一個馬販子道：</p>
<p>「朋友！你想，一個女人如何才算是美啊？」</p>
<p>依理，這該是長長的彎彎的眉吧，該是櫻紅的唇吧，該是長長的睫毛吧，該是小銀鈴般藍藍的眼吧，該是細細的腰　　的脚吧；然而，天呀！這馬販子怎樣答覆啊！他講：</p>
<p>「最好，他的脚，就像這樣。」他指着馬蹄。</p>
<p>這故事是證明了另一階級的人，决不會了解某一階級的，無論是在精神，在物質，其間似有不可踰越之高牆，而使之分成兩個世界。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰同情於被壓迫階級，而且在老年曾單身出走，冀以擺脱滿身無法擺脱的貴族味者。其結果，則覺悟目己不會成爲一個革命者。（那原因就因爲他是一個貴族。）「煩悶」的結局，使他逃進宗敎。</p>
<p>往讀Ｇ·Ｌ·Ｄｅｃｋｉｎｓｏｎ的近代論壇，中間有位詩人，他説是人生的價値總是存在生活裏，任何一種生活都有價値。因此在哀鴻遍野的農村，也就彷彿到處都塞滿了「田家樂」。他説：「甚至你們所詈駡的東西也有牠的價値。你們所説壞的東西雖然是很壞；可是同時又是那麽好」。他並且引申這意義：</p>
<p>有一次，我讀一篇那類可怕的文章—我想，那類文章總是有用的—關於佃民的生活狀况。讀了以後，我騎馬到鄉間走走，實在的境况並没有文章裏所説的那麽壞。我並不説一切都是很好的，然而却也好得使人驚訝。帶着蓬鬆距毛的大馬是休息在綠田上，牛兒正涉渡那淸淺的小河，楊柳緣着溪　拂，鳥兒依着蘆葦，還有天鵝，鷓鴣同畫眉。園裏開着鮮花，望去是一片茫茫的白，太陽光洗着的一個小花園，還有掠地而飛的雲影子。那篇所關心到的佃工却在良辰美景中工作。他並不像個苦痛的化身！他正在想他自己的馬兒或者他的麵包和乾酪，或者那在路旁呌喚的他的孩子，或者他的猪雞。我自然不以爲他了解四圍的景色是多麽美，但是我敢説他有種安逸的情緒。他對於自己的情狀，並不操心，不像你們替他躭的那種躭心。」</p>
<p>這位詩人又説：</p>
<p>「我常常覺得我彷彿對於一切人，一切物都愛得想去擁抱他們，因爲他們是那麽好，肯在這光榮的世界裏活着—一切汽車夫，馬車夫，做買賣的，貧民窟的房東，貧民窟裏的犧牲人們，娼妓，盜賊，無論他們如何地各有有他光怪陸離的背境，在那川流不息永刦長存的生命大河裏浮泛，不管是流過什麽國土，這條河本身就是好的，値得存在的。」　　當詩人口齒玲利地講了一通之後，我講點甚麽好呢？詩人以爲世界本來是好的，也本來是壞的，所以庸人自擾者，因爲許多人都失去其「生的趣味」罷了，於是，最好是安于現狀</p>
<p>，「詩人」也就可以悠然地做下去了。這現狀，詩人輩以爲是「那麽好」者，終于是「感情移入」的作用，倘使睜開眼，這現狀，彷彿也就壞得使人驚訝了。</p>
<p>不滿于現狀便怎樣呢？有一批可敬的靑年以爲這容易，像拈阄一樣隨手拈一種主義，記誦些高文典册，發表些小説詩歌，再張皇四顧，世界仍然腥臭而且糟雜。笑一知：「我原是理論家」。「實行者」原也有人，但大抵都是糊里糊塗地亂衝一陣，與自殺者無異。但也有的謹愼地遵着「將」令的，那結局也很難言，在中國彷彿也就有利用之嫌了。—所謂「將」者，原有其歷史性的，遠如秦末暴動中之劉邦，近如淸代的洪楊。人民偶有奮起，輙爲此輩狡點者所乘。</p>
<p>革命之前的一班鼓唇搖舌者不一定能了解革命，暴風雨之後，則會反而使他感到幻滅，因此也就沉默甚至反叛了。法國的詩人波特萊爾當巴黎公社初起時很讚助，但看看革命漸漸並不像自己所度想的結果的時候，也就開始反叛。</p>
<p>在中國，與其説是主的好壞的問題，倒不如説是人的問題；與其説是人的問題，倒不如説是悠久的歷史的墮性的緣故。中國在想翻身，然而中國太古老了。</p>
<h3>一座牆（一）</h3>
<p>— Ｒｏｂｅｒｔｏ　Ｂｒａｃｃｏ原著席滌塵譯</p>
<p>在古老的尼帕爾斯，有兩座相連的凄凉衰頽的樓房，在那裏，人像耗子一樣的的繁殖。高高五層樓上，一座厚牆把兩個小房間隔開了；隔開得是這麽近，可是又那麽遠。　　這兩間房相互從不往來。就是夜裏打樣子像深深皺紋的裂縫裏爬過的甲殼虫也兩樣—佈　滿了兩方汚暗的牆壁的蜘蛛也不同。可是在冬夜之墓樣的沉靜裏，一架縫衣機底不斷的達達聲—單調，永續，急促，却自己鑿通了一條看不見的道路透了過來；一方面，古老的石壁，兩間房的沉默的觀察者，在那時候也好像通了聲息起來。</p>
<p>靑年和自己疲乏的腦子鬥了一陣之後，終於决下了心用批頭的關節去叩牆了。他叩了幾次，縫衣機的聲音才猝然停上。他恍如從一塲壓在身上的夢魔中舒鬆過來，透了口氣，將耳朶凑了牆，聽聽有没有人會來同他説話。他聽得出，有個微弱的女子口音來對他開口了。</p>
<p>「是那一個在敲牆呀？」</p>
<p>「好女子，你聽得見我説話嗎？」</p>
<p>「你是誰呀？」</p>
<p>「請不要怕，是你的鄰居。」</p>
<p>「那末是什麽事情呢？」</p>
<p>「好女子，我懇求你停上你的縫衣機，到早晨再開罷。」</p>
<p>「我不能够挨到早晨。」</p>
<p>「你不能够！這於我有什麽關係呢？我有睡的權利呀。」</p>
<p>「話是不錯，不過我求你，請可憐我讓我工作罷。」</p>
<p>「你没有别的房間了嗎，好女子？」</p>
<p>「没有。」</p>
<p>「你可以到外面扶梯頭上去—你可以到外面—我又怎麽知道？階沿石上去。」２</p>
<p>「今晚上天很冷。而且門也關了，我又没有鑰匙。」</p>
<p>「你在自己房裏，倒説有門上的鑰匙！」</p>
<p>「眞没有。」</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我想在陸地上玩，必然還不怎樣有興；倘能在大海中浮遊，那樂趣，便越發不能想像了！但是在出國之前，屬於我們自己國内的各處大城市，凡有火車可以通達的，我自必要先去看看。對於出外旅行這一件事，我確有一種特殊的傾向，每當我想到我們這一次旅行不久就要回去的時候，心上便覺得無限的不痛快。</p>
<p>眞的，我相信如果太后能够允許他的話，他一定會永遠不想回去。因爲他回去之後，便只能終年的關在禁城裏或頣和園裏；而在這兩處等於監獄式的區域以内，他還是不能自由行動。説明白一些；他簡直比那些地位較高的太監都不如；而他所説的話，無論是命令别人，或督責别人，也往往没有什麽效力，較之我們幾個給太后所竉信的女官，眞是相差太遠了！所以他只要一想到這些情形，一想到回去，他的一隻眸子裏，—那是一雙很大又很靈活的眸子—便立刻會現出一種黯淡的神情來。如其太后不把他的政權全奪下來，仍讓他自由處置，他也許會給中國做些有益的事情。這是他自己永遠所認爲遺憾的。但是他終不敢向太后作半些表示。讀者可不要怪他太軟弱了，因爲不論他軟弱也罷，强硬也罷，照宫裏的習慣，做母親的儘可隨時替伊的兒子攝政，而做兒子的，更無論如何，不能反抗。於是光緒的才幹，他給這個習慣所埋没了！我相信他的思想的確是前進的，他的識見和能力，也足够担當起改善淸政的那副重担子來，可惜太后不肯讓他有施展的機會。（八○）</p>
<h3>瘋婦</h3>
<p>— 趙孝揚</p>
<p>將近黃昏的時候，恬靜的阜民路上，突然圍住了一大堆的人！</p>
<p>「看瘋子！看瘋子！」一陣奇異而尖鋭的呼聲，不住地在空中震蕩着，我終於被好奇心驅動了！便毫不疑遲的上去探了個究竟；</p>
<p>「抓人麽？我們没有犯法啊！瑞兒？你的爸呢！」一個中年婦人拉高着嗓子使勁地狂喊着：</p>
<p>骯髒的臉，蓬亂的髮，破碎的衣十足地顯出伊是個發瘋的婦人，在伊身旁，站着一個十來歲的孩子，大槪是伊的兒子吧·</p>
<p>「孩子，這是你媽麽？」</p>
<p>「是的！」他點着頭回答。</p>
<p>「你們怎樣會流落到這步田地？」經過了許多人的盤問，小孩終於把顚末告訴了我們：「我們是江西Ｘ縣人，家父在縣城裏開着一爿雜貨舖，規模雖小，營業十分發達，不料在去年的秋天，赤匪突然有進犯我們縣城的驚耗，那時，風聲緊急極了，駐在縣城裏的一團兵士，便乘着這個機會，向各家店舖子要錢，要東西，終於被他們搜括凈盡！後來！猖獗的赤匪奪城而進了！便聲勢汹汹挨户搜查，有錢的拿錢，没有錢的抓人，父親就給他們抓去了！至今生死不明，一面更縱火焚燒，我們倉皇地逃出了這個虎穴，好容易才流落到上海來，現在，把帶來的錢都用盡了！親戚又找不到，我媽經過這樣深重的刺激後，神經漸漸地錯亂起來了！」</p>
<p>小孩説到這裏，涙兒已像泉湧般的滴下來。</p>
<p>旁觀的，都有些兒酸心！慨憤！歎息！不約而同的給予他們幾個銅子兒。</p>
<p>「抓人麽！我們没有犯法呵瑞兒！你的爸呢！」中年婦依舊拉高着嗓子，使勁地狂喊着。</p>
<p>唉！慘痛的悲劇，是誰造成他們的呵！</p>
<h3>自由舞臺</h3>
<p>— 朱壽丞</p>
<p>没有鑼，没有鼓，更没有氍毺繡幕祗在士敏土的人行道上，占得一席地，用堊粉鈎出白色的「自由舞臺」四個大字。</p>

<h3>赤膊</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>中國人有一種習慣，到了夏天，愛赤膊。大凡温度在九十度左右時，小工苦力之輩，出賣勞力的不必提了，自然淸一色的赤裸着上體，就是南貨店，油酒糟坊，烟紙雜貨店裏的爬櫃檯朋友，麵館，飯店裏的跑堂的，以及街頭巷尾的設攤負販者，也一律的「點着大臘燭」。（赤膊的代名詞）而更其可怪的是手搖芭蕉大扇，逭暑納凉者，竟也赤着膊，在大街上散步。</p>
<p>赤膊，是洋鬼子瞧不起中國人的原因之一。所以在公園裏，是不許赤膊人涉足的，在電車裏，赤膊人是要給賣票的趕下來的。這些年來，我們中國人似乎也覺悟過來了，所以公安局裏，特備了不少的汗衫，以備警察抓到赤膊人，罰欵之後，給與蔽體之用。因此，市街間的赤膊人，現在已不似先前那麽一望無際了。</p>
<p>男子赤膊的，一天少似一天，但女子赤膊的，却一天多似一天了。在暑天，在交際塲中的女子，裸了二臂不算數，還要露出肩頭來，如今索性更進一步，把整個背部，都顯露着，而僅用一副奶罩，把二乳掩蔽着。在交際塲中是如此，在汽車中是如此，在綠蔭叢中散步，也是如此。男子赤膊是野蠻，女子赤膊是歐化而摩登，天下事之可解與不可解者，當無過於此者矣。</p>

<h3>談熱帶花魚（上）</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>年來飼養熱帶花魚的風氣，已盛行於各國，因爲有數十種花魚，比金魚的形態還生得艷麗珍奇，而且性質馴良繁殖亦快，所以人人都愛玩的。友人樓君方從美國回來，談及美國人從前本來酷愛金魚，現今因爲良種已少，都改變方針，愛養熱帶花魚了。東邦日本，最富模仿心與投機心，也極一時之盛，從南洋印度南美非洲等熱帶地方，輸入種種花魚，就是我也漸漸開始愛養了。樓君於回國時，曾選購數十種，建築魚房，悉心飼養，余於前月曾赴其庽所參觀，他用玻璃水槽，分别飼養，茲就所見，繼述魚類之種别與飼養方法如下：</p>
<p>（一）種類　熱帶花魚的種類，約有五十餘種，以淡水產的色彩爲最美麗，如（一）虹霓彩魚Ｒａｉｎｂｏｗｆｉｓｈ是中美洲所產的小魚形似鳳尾魚，雄魚有紅，黃，綠，藍，紫等重壘圓點花班，散在黑點的花紋中，好像虹霓的光彩，長二寸，這魚是胎生小仔魚，每次能生三四十尾小魚。（二）尖頭縧魚，Ｔｏｐ　Ｎｒｉｎｎｏｗ產自中美洲與北美南部地方的小川和池塘中，形似帶子魚，其背鰭與腹鰭，完全與帶子魚相同，惟比較稍大，黑地帶白斑，這魚的特點，即在腐敗不潔水中，也能生活，最喜食孑　與微生物，所以檀香山羣島，斐律濱羣島，南美等處，爲防除馬拉利亞蚊的弊害，蓄養此魚，可免蚊的孑　發生，故又稱食蚊魚。（三）帆鰭魚Ｍｌｏｌｉｉｅｎｓｉａ比尖頭　魚爲大，長約三四寸，背鰭很發達，好像帆船的帆形，生長於北墨西哥的稍有鹽分的池水中，全身有黑色縞紋，略帶紅灰色，頭與胸呈橙黃色，亦有全身紺紫色，眼的周圍，帶白暈的。（四）劍尾魚Ｓｗｏｒｄｔａｉｆ亦產於中美洲與墨西哥，尾端如劍，尖長成一直綫，尾綠黑色，又帶綠色，或黃色，身爲黃黑相間的橫條紋，但雌魚</p>
<p>則無劍尾，形比虹彩魚稍大。（五）赤錦魚Ｒｅｄｈｅｌｉｈｒｉ這魚與金魚的龍種扯旗相像，係劍尾與月魚的混種，色彩形狀不一，有橙黃色，銀白色，靑綠色，有橫腹帶縞紋的，有並列的黑斑的。（六）月魚Ｍｏｏｎ　ｆｉｓｈ產自南美及墨西哥，形似一年的小鯽魚，與金魚草種酷似，但有三種色彩，第一種帶靑碧色的光澤，第二種朱紅色中夾以黑斑的，第三種，濃黑色中帶有月形的斑點的，尾端與腹鰭都有黑點。（七）斑奇魚Ｐａｎｃｈａｘ產自熱帶美洲與非洲印度等處，其特色，鰭尾皆有很美艷的色彩，非洲產的，在體上有六根黑綫紋，鰓蓋有桂黃色斑點，亦有全身赤色，帶有大紅的綫紋，印度產的全身爲靑綠色，鰭有大紅斑點，尾綠由赤黑白三色相間，亦有全身靑黃，滿布大紅斑紋七列。（八）麗浮絡絲魚Ｒｉｖｕｌｕｓ體形細長，與鰌魚相似，產自巴西與中美洲，善於跳躍，常浮在水上休息，色似　魚雜以大紅的縞紋，與紹興產的游水魚相同，鰭爲黃色，亦有全身爲黃金色的。（九）佳諾麗魚Ｊａｎｕｒｉｕｓ與我國的丁斑魚相類，全身爲灰黃色，黑色斑點散布全身，產於西印度中美洲及南美的小川池沼中。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第三十一回三次交鋒白衣衝雪陣全營殉國赤眼入槍林</p>
<p>自强站起在一連人的前頭，緊接着前面一連人。只見關耀武蹲下他那大個子，將罼帽微微的向上昻着，露出一塊額頭來，兩手端了桿步槍，證着眼，咬着牙，向前看着，停幾分鐘，扭一下槍機子，極表現出這老行伍的態度。這回作戰，敵人是向東南面來的，大家雖不曾放鬆了西北面，但是這一營人傷亡了四分之一了，現在也只得把全副精神對付東南角。敵人的步兵，雖是進展不了，却也不肯後退，只管相持着。但是他們地面上進行不了，半空裏却相逼着了嗡嗡嗡的兩架飛機，在堡子天空上，互相盤旋起來。他們越飛越低，陸續的抛下了七八顆炸彈彈到處，那塵上如噴水池的噴水一樣，向上直湧，將守軍的眼光都迷隆起來。同時好敵人的陣綫裏面，槍彈密集着向堡上射擊。守軍對天空上的飛機炸彈，雖然，是都置之不管，無如那炸彈，由遠而近，直落到守軍面前來，飛土迷着眼睛，土地震動得身體不安，很感到不便，敵人再又密集射擊，彷彿一個人四面八方，都讓砲火包圍着了。自强到了這時，不但不知道害怕，而且怒火如焚，恨不得兩手抓着飛機的尾子，向堡子外扔了去。正這樣恨着呢？耳朶裏聰到轟的一聲，週身麻木，有兩三分鐘的工夫，失了知覺，待得自己醒過來的時候，看到關耀武守着的地方，堡城已是炸成了個缺口。堡城成了斜坡，那碎土凡自向下傾倒。他和附近一二十名弟兄，都不知所在了。同時，那堡外的敵人，發着一聲慘厲的呐喊，有百十來個人，端着上了刺刀的槍，對準了這缺口地方，如捲地落棄一般，擁了過來。自强雖拿着步槍，對了前面幾個人搶着射擊過去，但是他們人多，那何濟於事。（四三一）</p>

<h3>新花漲勢最有力</h3>
<p>棉市趨堅、且漲風尤熾、因美棉田畝報告利於多頭、而上漲三十五磅音、同時匯兑又縮、致人心愈昂、買風突濃、散空　市抵補者更多、且有一部份由空翻多、因之新棉漲勢尤烈、而本埠氣候仍旱、棉株發育、受其影響、</p>
<h3>鄭標漲五六角</h3>
<p>標棉前市開盤、美棉來電漲三十五磅音、政府田畝估計二八、零二四、零零零英畝、較私人估計减少一百萬畝、於是人心震動、空頭均不限價抵補、乃市價漲風較紗市爲激、盤盤向高、有一部份投機者傾向做多、而天氣甚旱、新棉更遭打擊、橷棉漲力殊强、各月均漲四·五·六角、全日成交統計十一萬二千六百担、查賣出吉豐二千九百担、大孚八千担、泰興二千六百担、愼昌六千六百担、恒德五千二百担、愼記五千三百担、泰昌一千七百担、大昶一千八百担、信誠三千六百担、森康一千三百担、買進同孚二千二百担、達記一千二百担、源大七千四百担、振大四千三百担、惠康六千担、遠大三千三百担、仁豐三千四百担、益記三千七百担、潤康四千二百担、源興昌二千八百担、長和一千六百担、德記一千九百担、一日間最高低價</p>

<h3>美棉高漲三十七磅音</h3>

<h3>糧食　廠抛不已　粉市漸見虚弱</h3>
<p>昨粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初穩繼跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回跌五七角左右、坎拿大小一二角不等、當開價時、因氣候依然乾燥無雨、業外人心、仍有收買、故各月份比較好半分不等、旋因福阜等廠、陸續傾抛、市氣即見虚弱、市塲又傳美麥估計、增八百萬蒲式耳、又謠傳大連抛開澳粉、此種消息、似與本埠紛出口、將須重受影響、至洋麥之實際情形、聞阿根庭現麥定價、連進口税約四元六七角左右、故本埠粉價如果超過二元三角外、則洋麥來華、將不可免、農村衰退之際、重予洋麥輸入、恐非國家社會之福也、結果本月份不動、八月份小一分、九十月份各小七釐半、十一十二月份各小一分半云、</p>
<h3>北路客户套售期麥</h3>
<p>遠期爲之帶落三四分</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、呈平定不前之象、以洋麥報價、　　　坎拿大　　　　　　　　　至五七角不等　故開價時、人心雖見老定、旋因浮　回出、客户套賣、市氣即見平軟、迨至下午開盤、各月份市氣疲弱、因江南各處、雖因久旱閙荒、北路產地、則雨量充足、河流通暢、故販運客帮、頗見熱閙、後市即因津浦路一帶客户、套售標凖、遼期各月份爲之帶落、不過本埠終感久旱、業外心思、當不易過分衝動耳、結果本月份較小一分、八月份小四分、九月份小三分、十月份小二分、十一月份小四分、十二月份小一分、現麥市情、尙呈平穩、到源接續、廠胃尙活、開徐州麥三元零八分、五河麥三元零六分、臨淮關麥三元零四六分、明光麥三元零五分、安亭麥二元七角三分、蕪湖麥二元八角半、次八角、大橋麥二元九角半、次九角、浦口麥二元八角半、次八角、蚌埠麥三元零四五分、江新州麥二元九角二分、次九角、新安麥三元零八分、由福新去一萬包、阜豐去二千</p>
<p>包、信大去二千包云、</p>
<h3>米市漲風再接再厲</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨各帮來源、續因天阜、内港淺涸、到者極稀、仍祗十五六號、（貨約二千六七百石）市况趨高、考其起漲原因、實以邇日來點雨全無、旱象已成、内地產米各區、都有被小浩枯阻、雖有米貨、無法運出、且農家保全新稻心切、忙碌車水、無心再事牽礱甩稻、因而來源稀乏、尙有滬市經此一度旱象、人心恐慌、食户中之向辦一石者、現竟多備二三石、銷塲乃激增三倍、供不敷求、各米價飛騰上漲、常帮白粳竟已高至十一元半、今市如各帮晚稻及粳米價格俱續上升三角有餘、杜洋尖及陰變元亦有二尺光景、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各帮來源念餘號、市上各貨去路、白粳續化、價又昂三四角、白元　粳　　交化、價形亦漲四五角、羊杜埠尖交易平常、價加二三角、客尖去胃本街及四鄉續動、價加二角四分、早稻亦加二三角、</p>
<h3>崇明帮起辦洋客秈</h3>
<p>西貢米以十元價兜攬定户</p>
<p>昨日客秈以天旱不雨、人心尙在望好中、且河下米以河道乾涸、來源日少、售價步高、因此貨主一律喊高、惟昨以連朝貪辦之内地帮忽然停手、其他進户一律抑價、因此市面立即轉平、雖粳米上升、而洋客秈反轉平站之局、後有崇明帮突起購辦、本街與囤户亦有問津、市又轉活、惟行情暫時平定、全日開出小絞二千五百包、各糙二千一百三十包、各機米五千包、多數爲本街與囤户辦去、崇明去二千多包、内地亦應酬機靖千餘包、行情與前日收價相似、</p>
<p>昨運孚行得西貢來電、一號西貢合申十元稍零、曾赴市兜攬定户、此價照目下市價尙未合劃、但此後米價再漲、即有劃定之可能矣、因上述原因、下午市上人心轉下、小絞米又自八元二角回至八元零五分、最後有人祗以八元之價肯回出、客秈各檔亦被蒂軟云、</p>
<h3>大批糧食出口運津</h3>
<p>自平瀋路通車後、北洋客帮、在滬採辦糧食甚活躍、上兩星期中、由滬運津之麵粉、約在四十萬包以上、米亦有三萬包、今年英商兩輪及招商新銘等三輪、出口赴津、計裝有麵粉二十萬包强、大米約六七千包、聞大批糧食運津、其中半數、將運出關云、</p>
<h3>黃豆收成將遭歉折</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆去路大暢、全市共計成交車輪各豆有五十七八車、「行情詳載市價欄」、聞油廠一帮採去有五十飶餘車、但行情祗好二三分、良因廠胃價高不取、故由售户凑之耳、刻下荳市趨勢、本無甚發展、茲因新豆年成　受天旱打擊、若常州之牛皮黃新豆恐無二三成之收數、漢口豆六成之譜、惟江西豆較好、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白隨關金略緊</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以關金轉升、趨勢略佳、公會划盤二四粗砂白現貨爲廿元○○三分、碼頭交貨二十元一角半、本棧貨廿元二角、太古糖Ｂ嘜呌升一角、爲二十元六角、本廠綿白振裕一號爲十八元八角、好起一角、號盤僅開出南寗片靑一百餘箱、價爲十元○二角、建帮開出大包冰六十餘袋、價爲二十三元三角、白片糖聞零星稍有開出、貨品高下不一、上落在角許之譜、潮靑號盤喊高、各行因走銷未旺、故觀望不前、</p>
<h3>閘北貨木耳軋缺激漲</h3>
<p>木耳　近以申市存底軋缺、而漢口到數亦少、以致逐步轉升、昨漢電又漲三元、此間行盤前後漲起四五元、漢口原包什耳售過八十六元、尙看再緊、</p>
<p>新金菜　較高之徐州貨行盤售二十四元半、聞後批到數必增、有步鬆之可能、二帮白紹興菜大約今日續到、</p>
<h3>絲茶天氣酷熱茶市轉淡</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、轉趨淸淡、藍以天時酷熱、英茶商多有臨時停止辦公、洋行家對於不急需之貨、均减少談盤論價、全市成交各路紅綠箱茶、僅祗一千九百餘箱、售價均無甚變動、惟各茶市面、仍以上中莊之珍眉綠茶、去路最佳、其餘均略見呆、至祁門紅茶、形勢依然軟弱云、</p>
<h3>疋頭駱駝絨已有定貨交易</h3>
<p>邇來天氣炎熱、呢絨生意因之淸淡、詎昨國產寛緊駱駝絨則已上市、而有現定交易若緯綸·天翔·維一·先達·勝達·大東·大南·華東·鴻發·茂業·申昌·經綸等各廠、咸有定出、蓉平帮都有現進、本街亦有定織、頭號貨普通均售一元九角、二號一元六角半、三號一元四角、毛背售二元五角、美術者二元二角半、祥裕公·恊記興二棧、交易較爲熱閙云、</p>
<h3>五金會司鐵津銷活動</h3>
<p>二百磅會司鐵因本街廠家、生意停頓後、市情即行寥落、故業中因實銷寥寥、頗抱悲觀、行情暗鬆、計每箱開二十八元、最近幾日、天津帮似有活動象、故開出三四百箱、本街廠家因　訊將過、亦有問津消息、故全市局面、已不右先前之悲觀也、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>熱浪</h3>
<p>— 岑</p>
<p>這兩天誰都苦着熱浪的侵襲。寒暑表升到一百多度，美國升到一百二十度以上，還有人竟被熱死。上海熱的也可觀，時疫已在漸漸蔓延了。入晚，馬路邊都坐滿了人。日間，辦公室内無法作事，晚上，更無法入睡。這熱眞苦煞一切人了。</p>
<p>然而也有不被浪熱所侵襲的，那就是一些有錢人和所謂要人們。他們上之可以上莫干山等地避暑，其次在上海也有相當的風凉設備，如夏屋渠渠，電扇呼呼，喝喝冰淇淋荷蘭水，义义麻將，晚上則乘汽車兜風，這是不會感到十分的苦熱的。最苦的是一班碼頭小工，黃包車夫，以及工廠工人。他們才眞苦呢。不是在烈日下奔跑，扛東西，便是關在機器房裏悶蒸。這簡直是非人生活。然而爲了要吃飯，雖苦也只好做。這是社會的不平，誰都一見就感到的。</p>
<p>與這自然現象相像，最近的世界政治，也正逢到了很高度的熱浪。西歐的軍縮糾紛，已是提高到無可再高的時候了。整個的歐洲，差不多已完全陷入殺聲震地的情勢中去。同時，東方日本反蘇鬭爭，也在着着加緊進行了。英美日，美日，德法，法意，這幾個主要對抗形勢，差不多大家都在拔刀相向，戰爭卽待明日。然而他們還有一個共同的敵人，這就是俄國。俄國是他們所認爲共同敵對的國家，這樣，他們在原則就必須消滅他。然而他們自己内部的矛盾，又不能使他立刻結起反俄的陣綫。然而他們反俄的目的，是始終不放棄的。越是世界不安，他們反俄工作，也越加緊。這樣，世界的鬭爭，又以另一新形式而加强其内容了。再則，和俄國站在同一方向地位的，更有全世界窮人們的蠢動，這些窮人們的蠢動，是很足以引起他們的憂慮。於是，他們在國與國之鬭爭外，更有這人羣與人羣的鬭爭，加强了他們紛擾程度，而且轉爲紛擾的中心所在。這樣，今日的世界政治，就以更熱烈的鬭爭程度而表現了。一切的一切，只表示着這熱度的加緊與提高。這和最近幾日自然界的熱浪的增高，簡直没有兩樣。</p>
<p>自然界的熱浪，總有一天要退的。而要把這熱浪退去，必須經過一番傾盆在雨。世界政治，也要經過一番傾盆大雨，才能回復到淸凉世界。把全世界間人的熱浪，一掃而空。</p>
<h3>災</h3>
<p>— 席珍</p>
<p>瞧着：今天又是一天的旺太陽！</p>
<p>剛把阿虎呌來去接工，約摸半枝香的時光，三阿爹便提着一件汗濕了的布衫裸着上身從田裏回來啦，一眼看見坐在堂屋裏的從城裏來的三囝爺。</p>
<p>點了點頭，丢下汗濕了的布衫，拉過一個條凳來，一坐下，灰色的未來的影子又浮上啦：</p>
<p>（荒年！汗的流，血紅的太陽，倒垂的樹枝，乾黃的稻桿，粉一般的黃色的泥土。完啦，又是完啦！瞧着城裏十元七角一担的米價，又準是一個餓肚子的年份囉。）</p>
<p>從天剛亮的時候起，便在雙人車上不停地車着水，太陽囇着的時候，粉一樣的泥土，一見水就吸，一吸又馬上就</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>乾啦，車了六個鐘頭的水，還是那個樣子。可是，眼見小河裏的水都乾啦，怎麽辦呢？怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>想着，彷彿看見吊在車架上的喘着氣的阿虎，與倒了的稻桿，嘆了一口氣：</p>
<p>「又是個荒年！三年兩頭荒，怎麽得了呢？」</p>
<p>「可不是嗎？這年頭什麽都弄不好，種田的種田荒，做生意的生意荒—一處荒處處荒，什麽都弄不好！」</p>
<p>聽着三囝爺的從城裏帶來的語調，便附和地也跟着嘆息啦：「這年頭眞是</p>
<p>變了，連天老爺多没了眼睛。」</p>
<p>（不是聽説春上上海來了什麽活佛的，又在杭州打過醮的嗎？可是，徧又過着那麽一個年份。）</p>
<p>這年頭是隨便做什麽事都不興的。</p>
<p>想着，五十多年的苦難的影子便又浮上啦：活了五十多年，簡直没一年好日子過，就説近幾年吧：水災，兵災，旱災：難得去年收成好一點，可是穀子又徧賣不出錢。每年每年聽見的祇是一些什麽捐什麽捐的新名詞。</p>
<p>「種田眞不是人幹的事，這年頭住在鄉下也祇有　死。」</p>
<p>「可是，城裏不也一樣嗎？」三囝爺一開口便是「城裏城裏」的。「我家的老表上個月剛從上海回來啦。説開了年連工廠都關了幾十家，工也没有做啦。」　　大家都靜寂了，想着：這年頭什麽路都走不通。</p>
<p>瞧着外面一地的旺太陽，心頭便像淋了一下滾水似的。完啦，完啦。前天村上十三份人家凑起錢來請道士求雨；可是又有什麽用呢？祇有用洋龍，可是洋龍船早給人家包定啦。而且，瞧着自己連去年剩下的米都没有多少了，那裏來的錢呢？</p>
<p>想着田裏的倒垂了的稻桿，想着一種一種的捐税的名稱（這些三阿爹始終攬不淸楚，）想着秋季的租米，想着一家的一年的食糧</p>
<p>心頭一橫：便把什麽都放下啦：管它，左右祇剩得幾條命了，等着吧，等着吧。想起阿虎那孩子從城裏聽來的話：</p>
<p>「到眞不得了的時候，便準備用血來幹一下！」</p>
<p>「幹一下！」</p>
<p>可是，聽三囝爺説，這年頭幹也没你的份，什麽都没你的份。</p>
<p>兩顆心全像淋了雨一樣的。</p>
<p>遠遠地，阿虎又流着滿頭的汗走來啦：「該死，眞不得了，小河裏的水都乾啦，還車什麽。祇有用洋龍！」</p>
<p>「用洋龍，用洋龍！」</p>
<p>可是，一定的：完啦，完啦！</p>
<p>然而，突然地，心頭又像寛了好多，前面準是一個大希望，不可料的，準備着，淮備着吧。</p>
<p>慢慢地聽見站起來的三囝爺説：「過了夏預備把那家小烟紙店也收啦。近幾個月來連五個錢一支的香烟都没人買。」</p>
<h3>百餘萬元的化妝品費</h3>
<p>— 霜萍</p>
<p>正因爲想利用婦女們的愛國熱情，來抵抗外貨，才有所謂婦女國貨年的發明。自婦女國貨年這口號被利用來推行自己的出品以來，的確，許多以販賣國貨爲號召的商塲增加了不少的生意。</p>
<p>然而今年海關關於五月份上海婦女用品進口總數的報告，却給我們一個失望的消息。去年度香水脂粉進口，不過達二一百五十餘萬元。有心人已爲之吃驚不少，因而有所謂婦女國貨運動的組織。可是今年海關五個月的統計，説婦女用品進口數爲一百十一萬元，包括化妝品具二十二萬九千六百十元，眞假首飾十三萬六千二百四十元，香水脂粉七十四萬七千六百二十七元。這數目更爲可觀。</p>
<p>我們愛美的姊妹們，是不是要和提倡國貨年的老先生們開開玩笑，那我不得而知。然而這消息，却很可令人尋味。</p>
<p>在男子們正努力誘惑婦女而婦女們失却自尊心的時候，脂粉，香水這些東西是丢不掉的。大家旣以奇裝異服來粉飾文明，而没有澈底覺悟的婦女藉此來享樂，任你怎樣提倡節儉，也没有用的罷。</p>
<p>其實，一百十一萬元的脂粉香水，也不算得是個很大的數目，然而許多忘了本身的奢侈的男人們却大驚小怪的引爲痛駡婦女的目的了。假如你們不把這些東西運進來的話，人家又從那裏去買。可知道這還不是婦女們獨有的罪過，然而挨駡的到是我們的婦女了。</p>
<p>難道男人們不用香水，香粉嗎？我們常常都會看見他們在買這些東要，尤是在路上會嗅到男人們的香水啊，他們用的是國貨嗎？未必。</p>
<h3>暑天被遺棄了的人們</h3>
<p>— 櫻櫻</p>
<p>一個不能算是屋子，其實也祇能容量這麽幾個人地位的藏住。</p>
<p>丈夫：一個被家庭間併棄了的患有重量的神經衰弱症者！</p>
<p>妻子：過分了的勞働總失去了先前的健康，慢慢由美麗的臉龐變得削瘦成這麽一個多縐紋路條的尖長臉！</p>
<p>兒子：才臨這世界上，還不滿一個足月；不過相信决不是怎麽强壯的孩子！具有爸的衰弱個子，一樣也有媽那麽樣淸瘦的臉子。</p>
<p>他們不能時常飽着肚子。當然更也談不上喝汽水；假使每一次的太陰，猛烈地作向他們示威，呵，除了這麽以身子低住，還是再不能逃避！</p>
<p>天，天就這麽氣窄不過越窮的人。她不情願讓窮人也能有吃飽肚子的權利！相反，她預備賜予的是一個多親近熱氣的機會。</p>
<p>週身是曾被熱氣盪過去許多熱泡的。</p>
<p>丈夫也曾有一時期想到過這一層，長時間的居留鴿房抵擋熱氣成績决不是祇會反應出這麽幾個熱泡的。眞的有這樣再熱下的一天，或許屋子里隨便一個人是遭到了更進一步的危險的話，可怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>妻子説，讓我們把一部分時間消息磨到公園中，比較能恢復些生命的泉露。好像這提議多够淸鮮；不過丈夫的搖着頭，指示了她還不是一個多費口思的失望？</p>
<p>日問難　　得已不能擺脱的事實無疑啦。希望走人家去，能消磨上些避熱氣的時間，不過還不很爲難，尤其假使對於是一個失業者的時常蒙光降，情願還是拱手退避三舍；事實並不預備向人借錢，僅微的一個願望，能給他躱避過了整天的熱氣網吧！但是這苦衷的用心誰能知道理？一輩子都不會有人了解的。</p>
<p>暑天，是儘向窮人發洩的天氣，眞的，窮人們被遭併棄已無可挽回啦。丈夫對着妻子歎着氣，妻子轉在孩子臉上釘了幾眼，没好氣打了幾下屁股。哇！孩子還是不懂的被哭了起來。</p>
<p>有一天，氣温突然降低了六度以下的天氣！孩子病了，病得很利害。據經騐者告訴他們，這是由於氣候的不調正緣故，而且還是在天熱時睡開了門窗被冷風侵進了身子。孩子没抵抗力量，受不住二重的寒熱，一旦碰到冷氣温天氣翻出了！多半這病不能有希望？</p>
<p>妻子急得了手冷，但是當她摸着孩子的手也像自己一般冷得可怕，昏去了！一個斛斗。</p>
<p>丈夫没知道，在外邊，他正爲了領得一筆意外進欵而歡喜！買了瓶沙示水，自己還喝了二杯凉的酸梅湯。他知道妻子怎麽的口喝！有這麽一瓶汽水帶回去，該使她怎麽的歡喜而需要哩！</p>
<p>踏着大步的脚子，好像輕鬆得許多！推進門，没絲兒聲響！妻子和孩子都服貼的睡在床上。</p>
<p>這麽天，虧還打得上午覺？</p>
<p>依舊没有回音，心里着了慌！</p>
<p>走近去，推了妻子的手臂像有些疆硬！裏床睡倒的孩子，眼珠子翻出那樣白！</p>
<p>呵！··呐··</p>
<p>瓶從手空間滑到脚背，水　浸透了整個襪子的背面！</p>

<h3>夏天的回憶</h3>
<p>— 李葵</p>
<p>又是夏天了啊！太陽還是這様熱烈烈地，微風還是這様温柔柔地。住在這大都市裏，連玩的地方都没有，眞是又寂寞又枯燥啊！</p>
<p>眞使我害怕呀！怎麽過呢！去公園，去游泳池都要Ｐａｓｓ，都要錢啊！已經困難到没有飯吃，没有房子住，那裏還有力量買Ｐａｓｓｓ呢！</p>
<p>只好這麽寂寞着，枯燥着啦！這是活受罪啊！處在這種境域中，那能不呌我追憶那夢一般的從前呢！</p>
<p>也是這様的夏天啊！太陽也是這様熱烈烈地，微風也是這様温柔柔地。可是那時候的我，不寂寞也不枯燥啊！</p>
<p>那是暑假在故鄕裏啊；我們早晨坐在柳樹夾成的河邊釣魚；小魚一尾一尾地往上「抵樓」，（註）那時眞比吃魚還要快活啊！</p>
<p>午後，我們又都脱　光了衣服，跳到大河裏去游泳，游够了就躺到沙灘上曬；曬熱了再跳到水裏去游；這様，身體是再舒服没有啦！</p>
<p>有的時候，我們還登上東山，跑到石崖旁去採山杏和糖梨；站在山峯上遠望；或者竄到樹林裏去抓山雀和蟈蟈啦！</p>
<p>還有，那是在學校的時候，同愛人坐着小船渡到江南，沿着柳樹和叢草中的小道，手握着手，肩靠着肩，相倚相靠地往前走啊！</p>
<p>有的時候，我們並排地站在江邊，默默地望着流水和白雲；有的時候，我們就跑到密叢叢的幽林裏Ｋｉｓｓ起來啦！</p>
<p>啊，這一切的一切，都是值得回憶的啊！可是我的心痛啦！我的愛人已經不愛我了，我的故鄕已經被日本帝國主義佔領啦！</p>
<p>我的愛人不知道摟在那個闊少懷裏？我的故鄕不知道已經變成煞様？更不知道何時才能重見？其實這些都是應該忘掉的啊！</p>
<p>可是在我没有事情做的時候，又不免引起我一番夢一般的回憶啊，這是葡萄酒一般的回憶啊！</p>
<p>註··抵摟—就是提。</p>
<h3>談暑期軍訓</h3>
<p>— 星南</p>
<p>官様文章上的暑期軍訓和事實上的暑期軍訓是不可同日而語的。</p>
<p>官様文章上的暑期軍訓意義是非常重大的，它被視爲軍國民敎育的先聲；被視爲徵兵制的初步嘗試。我們以事實做根據，覺得暑期軍訓的意義决不能像官様文章上所説的重大。原因有三··</p>
<p>（一）人與人的關係··平時是一様的同學，你要我這做，我可以不服從你，一旦你做了官長，我做士兵，要我處處服從你，事實上兩方面都難辦到。做官長的難以爲情，做士兵的老實説不會甘心的。要把長時期的朋友關係，在短時期內一變而爲官長和士兵關係，理論上似乎很容易，實際上却有很多困難。因此便影響到紀律問題，「一致」是軍隊第一條紀律，「一致」的維持，由於絕對的服從，現在服從難辦到，一致便生問題了，紀律便根本談不到，所以雖以軍營的威嚴，還是有茶房們拿了汽水，冰洪淋，冷麵出入，追本溯源還是由於人與人的關係的疏鬆。</p>
<p>（二）時間問題··本來的規定是這様的··「凡高中三年畢業生須至指定地點集中，受三個月軍訓。」後來因爲這於畢業的出路有相當影響，所以便改爲高中學生每學年暑期中受三星期軍訓。當然、這也是没有辦法中的一個辦法，但是每次軍訓，相隔一年，第一年的科目，到第二年開始，能否完全記得，便生問題，斷斷續續的訓練，不免有一暴十寒的弊病吧。</p>
<p>（三）訓練不一致··預定是集中訓練的，可是像上海，根本便没有這麽一塊大塲地供給七千幾百個中學生行軍隊生活，無可如何祇有各自爲政各在本校訓練，因此訓練便難以一致。雖然訓練總監部也曾召集過一個敎官會議規定敎授科目，但總不能像集中訓練般的一致。</p>
<p>敎育部感訓練總監部要想從暑期軍訓中，造就正式士兵，是超乎夢想的幻想！</p>
<p>雖然，暑期軍訓的意義，不能副行政者之望，但在他們理想之外、例有二點。對於我們學生有相當的益處的寫在下面··</p>
<p>（一）刻苦的練習··我們學生的善唱高調是不可諱言的事實，我們要商人不買賣外貨，我們要農人穿土布，我們駡要人　預，但我們自己仍舊是全國最幸福最享樂的一個階級。暑天中，農人不可不播種，工人不可不做工，一切的人不能因熱停止工作，我們學生却有我們的暑假，我們呐喊着要人家刻苦，我們自已先刻苦起來，暑期軍訓雖是一件不十分苦的事，但至少比躺躺喝喝蕩蕩要苦些，吃苦也是要磨練的，暑期軍訓便是一個様會。</p>
<p>（二）體格的鍜鍊··生活無定時，最易生病，貪吃懶做的人，常常會被病魔纒繞，能够把軍訓看做正正經經的一種工作，上操，上課，吃飯，睡覺，按時進行，再也不怕細菌的侵襲，軍訓，結果，能否抵抗敵人，不可擔保，能够抵抗病菌，這是可以擔保的。</p>
<p>模擬的軍隊生活，倒已過了一星期，並不像理想中的爲難，苦惱。家中没有姊妹兄弟的我，能延長三星期團體生活，尤其覺得快樂，希望讀者同我一様，快樂地受這三星期暑期軍訓。</p>
<h3>都市與衛生</h3>
<p>— 杞生</p>
<p>都市在表面上看起來，那是比較農村衛生得多，其實不然。在農村，街道的骯髒，毛坑到處可見；在都市，街道的整潔，毛廁要找都難以找到；假如以街道與毛廁這些來作都市與農村的衛生與否的標準，那自然是都市比較農村衛生得多了。然而，最能够使居住的人害病不康健的東西，是空氣中的有毒的微生物；這種東西都市的空氣裏頭到處都有，而農村那是很少，甚至於可以説是没有。農村的空氣淸鮮，都市的空氣污濁，這是誰都承認的事；都市的空氣因爲人烟稠密，炭氣多，因此污濁，但是不止污濁而已；裏頭的有毒微生物之多，如以顯微鏡探照，簡直令人心悸。這一種有毒微生物是什麽東西呢？梅毒菌與淋病菌最多。如上海吧，公開賣淫之外，私娼到處都有；而且生活糜爛者的一班梅毒菌淋病菌的製造者天天在傳播於都市每一個角落，空氣裏頭雜着從她們與與和她們一起製造的他們的身上飛散出來的毒菌，濔漫於每一個都市的空間。你以爲你潔身自愛，可是你從都市的空氣裏頭吸收到這一種毒菌而自己不曉得，一旦病發，莫名其妙，這才寃哉枉也。因此住居都市的人，十九血不淸潔，並非過語。因此都市談衛生，嚴格地從實質上加以考察，根本談不上。現在的衛生運動，從日常的起居飲食講究，固然可以避免被毒菌傳染於萬一，—如人們不隨地吐痰小便，他的身上的毒菌比較地難以傳染於别人—可是，空氣裏頭總是雜着從那一些有毒菌的人們的身上呼吸時候飛散出來的毒菌，你如何講究衛生總是要吸空氣，一吸空氣便被傳染上了。</p>
<p>都市要講究發生，根本上應該從梅毒菌淋病菌的禁絕與預防上設法，如果不然，後患不堪設想！</p>
<h3>甘菊</h3>
<p>— 赤</p>
<p>（眼睛痛着，紅着；紅得像兩片緋色的月季瓣兒。當空氣在爲人世的不幸焦灼的時節。</p>
<p>朋友勸我買點甘菊來，冲着開水解渴。</p>
<p>幼年時代的夏季啊··新鮮的　葉自荷缸裏折來泡了；母親更愛以成束的靑蒿扱在茶缸裏，凉着當飲料——多少帶着鄕村景味的小城市風趣，在夏季是十足充分地表現着。一眨眼，於今也别離了多時啦！</p>
<p>甘菊，帶來了我懷舊的心情。可是，多半也瀝過了社會的面紗吧）</p>
<p>甘菊，那小小的白絨球似的花朶，米色的，乾悴的，膽小而又茁黃的瓣層裏，幽怨地寃屈地蕴結着····有生之日的欣榮····然而，我更覺行是像四千年來中國女人似的，素小的身材，節婦般地鬱結的生活底寫影····没有笑，没有太陽，····有的冰度下的幽靈之蠕動，終究也寂然地死了。</p>
<p>來一個解放呀！</p>
<p>那麽十朶，安排在玻璃盞裏。沸了的水洩了她們木乃伊之悲哀！</p>
<p>舒展了··（縱然有些墜瓣）她併們不慣地盪漾於盞面；一種情深，十分心苦，温柔地撫媚地牽住了手，一個倚着一個····</p>
<p>芽芽的，那是她們的心哪！在微笑，呼吸是急促着。一顆顆細小的泡沫，我懂得的，在低語呵！</p>
<p>將一片玻璃碟，珍重地護蓋了她們。</p>
<p>鵝黃的，美麗而平和的色素，是她們的氣息呀！在此鵝黃的琉璃宮中，她們沈沈地睡去了。</p>
<p>細諦他們的惺忪，偷偷地吻了——清冽的，淡然而有遠致的芬芳，沁了我的心。</p>
<p>不忍分了她們的氣息，供着吧！</p>
<p>只要一碰那玻璃盞，又似小姑娘般地輕輕跳了····</p>
<p>十小時後··</p>
<p>我害怕了··慘綠地，慘綠地，她們潰散在慘綠裏了憔悴的瓣兒沈澱了，心背的帶兒正漾着滲綠之汁···</p>
<p>慘綠的玻璃盞，慘綠的宮殿呀！慘綠的墳塋！慘綠的尸身已殘碎了。</p>
<p>慘綠的淚珠着上我慘綠的眼臉。</p>
<p>慘綠的中國女子呀，慘綠的中國女子呀！</p>

<h3>改絃</h3>
<p>— 洋洋</p>
<p>近來新人物，常常和他的舊夫人離</p>
<p>異，而與另一位新的對象結合。這一類的事件，在各地社會上發生，多至不可勝計。最著名的，前者當然要數敎育界某名流；後者却要説藝術界某名畫師咧！他們這種「爲德不終」的頑意兒，旣負「見好愛好」「棄舊憐新」之薄倖名，又未能本「鴻案相莊」「白頭偕老」之古訓」，而且更没來由，並不爲什麽事，發生什麽惡感。祇是無緣無故，硬錚錚别鵠離鸞，鏡破釵分，惹得四面八方責難紛來，好像有些不値得。</p>
<p>何况他們所憐的新人，還不是一般普通的女性，又皆是亡友的寡婦遺孀。在舊道德和新生活上看來，當然是很可以討論的一個問題。然而在新潮流時代巨輪之下，却又「司空見慣」極平淡無奇，似乎算不了一回事，不必不驚小怪！</p>
<p>曾經有人對於這一類把戲，給他創造了一個名詞，呌做「改絃」。因爲每一個男子的太太死了，本呌作「斷絃」，太太旣死了以後，再娶一位太太，呌作「續絃」，似這般生死難合，旣然都是絃來絃去。那麽，現在他的太太却是好好活着，硬要和她拆開，而另娶一位太太，所以用上這一個「改絃」名義，當然確而又當，無什麽疑義。</p>
<p>中國近年來，「改絃」的事件很多，在同時也以看出中國婦女界的賢德個不？因爲那些活着未死的太太們，如果性同意恊議離約，不怕她們的丈夫，如何有名，如何有勢，怎能够違反法律而重婚呢？越是有名有勢的，格非要依法定手續，保全他的名勢。除非暗中偸偸摸摸，明往暗來，幹古代韓壽先生的法門，然而這也很危險，一經戳穿西洋景，馬上三方面不討好，事情弄僵，格外不好辦，最近關於重婚和遺棄的前後夾攻，好像也有不少的名流負了這種刑事責任，是均没有明白採取「改絃」之制度，就不免做了婚姻的罪人啊！</p>
<p>好笑那些活着的太太們，大多數情願抛却一已之幸福，而爲「改絃」下之犧牲者，好使她們的丈夫，得到快樂，或是利用婚姻上的其他便利，便毅然捨棄一切，允許離婚，讓他們再賦關睢，重吟好她。這樣能忍能讓的行爲，又仁又慈的美德，的確很可以使我們欽佩。不過因此却反映山許多受潮流洗禮者之男子們，常常演着棄舊憐新的把戲，是怎樣的可鄙，就是那新結合的對象，一點芳心中，恐也要含悲涙，帶着恐慌和疑問！暗下思量道：前車可鑒，不要在他日我也蹈覆轍吧？因爲女子天賦的同情心，和柔軟腸子，較男子們却立於反比例。記得某名畫師的舊夫人在離婚時曾對人説：「某先生是我之愛人，我不願愛人不歡，又因愛人必得某女士才歡，故我願離去，但願他們二人永久相愛相安。」啊呀！這一夕話，表面看來，是何等光明偉大，又近於頌祝。但是切實看來，却又句句是涙，字字是血，可憐改絃下之中國賢德太太們，眞有一肚皮的委曲，無從訴起啊！</p>
<h3>最後的信</h3>
<p>— 李瓊</p>
<p>親愛的姊姊：</p>
<p>你知道嗎？我現在又病倒在這舉目無親的地方了，我知道我的生命這次無論如何不會再有希望的了，可是我們遙遠地隔離着，要想作最後的一次會見都没有可能呵！因此，不得不拚命的掙扎着來給你最後的一封信。</p>
<p>死，本來是每一個人都離不了的，不過我還年輕哩，我現在才二十歲呵！我所要作的事一件也没有做到。我的一生實在太悽慘了。</p>
<p>好！死罷！快點斷氣罷！我也不願這樣苦痛地多延日子，反正死神是只包圍着窮人的。</p>
<p>可憐呵！病了快要死了，吃藥當然更談不到，可是，我想飽飲一次熱水都不能如願呵！死··天呀！求天快些帮我斷絕最後一口氣罷！</p>
<p>姊姊，你没有看見這兒所謂收復失地戰後的慘况呵！房屋是成了一片焦士，成堆的男女老幼的屍骨，這種臭味我想你是無論如何想像不的到呵！，因爲我身體的抗抵力弱，於是染了時疫了。死！我現在打定主意和這收復區内的可憐的被壓迫的屍骨堆在一起去。姊姊！要是我和這一堆都能復活的話，不，就是精神不死的話，讓我們再見呢。</p>
<p>我的死，你絕對不要使媽知道，你每月用我的名字，學我的筆蹟寫幾封信回去安慰她老人家，只要能照這樣做，媽是不會知道的。</p>
<p>記得媽曾説過：「中兒，你去吧，」因爲在家也是没有出路的呵！你出門去最少比你哥哥使我放心些，因爲你有着這樣肥胖的强健的身體。」天呀！誰知我進工廠不到一年，我全身的精力和肉給都那連耳朶快鬧聾的扎扎的機器聲一絲一毫地輾去了。</p>
<p>我爲了不能忍受這無情的壓迫和苦痛才脱離這苦海，和我親愛的工友們别離而跑到這剛收復的失區來做一點小差事。誰知一到這裏，當我每次換上整齊的制服下鄉淸查户口的時候，這尙未被難的老百姓們將我全身打䁁一番之後，接着便以怨恨的眼光注視着我和我的同伴。當我第一次遭受到這種不幸的時候，我便感到十分不安，我想，爲什麽和我一樣窮苦的老百姓們也不能同情我呢？哦！···</p>
<p>請你轉我的工友們，祝他們努力地勇敢地走向自己的光明的前途。我覺醒了，我知道壓迫和痛苦是要在另一個社會才能解除的呵！</p>
<p>好了，我不能再寫下去了，我的心在絞痛得難受，我哭不出眼涙，喊不出聲音，手指再也握不住筆管。好了，親愛的姊姊！永别了。大約在今天晚上我將呼不出最後一口氣來。祝你前途光明</p>
<h3>廢話連篇（一）</h3>
<p>— 文丐</p>
<p>結了婚的人説：「結婚是戀愛的墳墓」，在戀愛中希望結婚的人以爲：結婚就眞的是戀愛的墳墓吧，進了墳墓也甘心。</p>
<p>過來人常常以爲自己是有智識的，可是向他走過的路走着的人對於他的智識，如呌人浪子回頭的話等於放屁。因此過來人常常以爲是聰明了，其實那一樁告誡的話就是傻子才會説的。</p>
<p>聰明人常常説：「傻子也會説聰明話，」其實會説聰明話的傻子，在那説話的時候，他比聰明人還要聰明。</p>
<p>聰明人到了明知自己做錯了事或者説錯了話而不承認是錯誤的時候，他已經變成了傻子而不自覺。</p>
<p>只有知錯認錯走進一步獲得人們的更加信仰的聰明人，才是十足的聰明人。</p>
<p>聰明人常常利用謾駡的方法來壓服對方，可是不但不會壓服對方，反而使對方認識了你：是一個淺薄無恥的無賴漢，對於你只有不服心。然而聰明人一看對方置之不理以爲自己勝利了，得意洋洋，更表現出聰明人已經變成了傻了。</p>

<h3>好像失去了靈魂似的不安呢</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我現在有一個萬難解决的問題，特地懇求　先生犧牲一點寳貴的光陰，指點我一條光明的途徑吧；我知道：先生是我們輕靑的南針，不幸者的救星，一定可以很慷慨答應的。</p>
<p>我是一個未曾結婚的男子，今年已經三十三歲了，曾經畢業於某大學，在敎育界服務，有七年之久，對於已過的一切，自問還可以過得去；但是在最近二年之中，有我的一個學生某女士，今年才十七歲，爲人很是活潑伶俐，讀書很努力，學業亦很有進步，不想，她竟和我發生了戀愛，在起初的時候，（二年前），她每逢見了我，很是親熱，並且時常喜歡和我説長道短，那時我並不以爲奇因爲她是我的學生，而且又是一個天眞的小孩子，再説，一個學生和一個敎師，在課餘之暇。談談説説，也是常有的事，那裏知道，我今日的萬難問題，就從此產生了。</p>
<p>起初的當兒（二年前），我們不過談談笑笑而已，後來在去年的春間，不知不覺的，我們就步入了情網了，不久我們通信，看電影，逛馬路等，雙方愛情熱度，一天增高一天。在去年年假之後，我們爲避免嫌疑起見，我就介紹她到另外一個中學去讀書，但是這愛的熱度，反而進步的愈加迅速，情書往來更密，三天以内，至少要見面一次，或同去看一次電影，否則，好像失去了靈魂似的不安呢！我老實的告訴你吧，從去年暑假起，直到如今，我已經接到她的信，有八十餘封了，從這一點上推想，我們愛好的熱度，也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>前面的一切，不過是我們相愛後，所經的歷史。但是這萬難解决的中心問題，還在下面呢：（一）我的年紀，計算起來，要大她十六歲，假使我要和她結成婚姻，對於前途，有没有阻礙？（二）我們是處在師生的地位，一旦成爲夫婦，有没有意外枝節？（三）她的家庭，是一個半新式的過渡家庭，我們應當要用什麽方法才可以使她的家長贊成？因了以上的幾個問題，我們簡直弄的坐臥不安，進退無術了。懇求　先生，大發慈悲，替我們趕緊想一個妥善的辦法，來成全我們的生命。我們是感激不盡的。順頌撰安　某某君謹上</p>
<p>答：眞正的以純潔愛情結合的，是不因有師生關係就應被否認？當然，假借師生的接觸機會而去戀愛，我們是不能贊同的。你與某女士愛情旣如此熱烈，萬難分離，自以結婚爲是。年齡相隔太遠，能使雙方的旨趣意向不能接近，所以年齡相差過遠的婚姻要比年齡接近的婚姻離婚的事件多些，至於生理上並無妨礙，而且還以男子較大些爲宜。你們旣然熱戀，雙方趣味意向當無因年齡而不同之處，所以這一點並不成問題第三，她家庭旣是半新式，則你們進行婚事，當然還是須用央媒説合辦法。</p>

<h3>Drought, Famine, and Flood Overlap: How Can the Common People Survive? Autumn Harvest in Drought-Stricken Areas Nears Hopelessness, Frequent Heavy Rains Turn Villages into Swamps, Riverbanks Burst, and Dikes Are All Reported as Endangered. Continuous Heavy Rains in Northern Hebei</h3>
<p>(Beiping) In the area of Northern Hebei, there have been continuous heavy rains for days. Due to flash floods in the upstream mountains, the Baihe River, Chaohe River, and Jianhe River have all risen sharply. The Chaohe Bridge south of Nantianmen, which was washed away last month, has not yet been repaired. The low-lying areas along the North Canal downstream are mostly submerged, and the crops have suffered extremely heavy damage. The Pingyu Highway has been largely washed away, and long-distance buses have been temporarily suspended. Due to the continuous rain in Hebei and Jehol, river waters have surged, and mud and sand have flowed downstream. The water source for Beiping has always relied on the Baihe River in Sunhe Town, Shunyi County, but due to the surge in river water, the water quality is turbid. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Rivers in the Northern Hebei area have risen sharply due to continuous heavy rains. The Chaohe bridge south of Nantianmen was washed away by the water. Many low-lying areas along the North Canal were submerged, causing considerable damage to crops. The water level of the Yongding River west of Beiping fluctuated greatly, once rising to seventeen Chinese feet, receding to eleven feet five inches on the morning of the 10th, but rising again to sixteen feet at one o'clock in the afternoon, with the current being quite rapid. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Luan River Floods Upstream</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) There has been heavy rain in various places in eastern Luan. The ditches around Tangshan are all full. The Zunhua-Tangshan long-distance telephone lines are all damaged. The coal-carrying rivers from Dahong Bridge to Daodi and from Xugezhuang to Lutai are all overflowing. Villages are reporting flooding. The Luan River has risen sharply, with the upstream already overflowing and the downstream water level less than a foot from the riverbank. To ensure safe passage for trains to and from the Beining Luanhe Railway Bridge, due to fears of danger, it has been ordered that trains with ballast be used. On the 10th, one hundred members of the Beining Railway Bureau's track patrol police team were dispatched to guard the various bridges in eastern Luan to protect the safety of traffic. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Disaster in the Lower Reaches of the Xiang River</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The Jin Yintan dike on the Zhanggong dike in Hankou showed cracks on the 10th due to the impact of the river water. The downstream of Xiang River has been flooded, causing a disaster. The riverbanks of Mianyang, Hanchuan, and Hanyang are all in danger. The entire Ximakou Gaohu dike has collapsed, causing many deaths by drowning. The Yongshu dike has also burst, affecting more than seven hundred *li*. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Drought and flood disasters are occurring simultaneously in Hubei Province. Counties such as Qianjiang, Mianyang, Zhongxiang, and Jianli in western Hubei have experienced flooding following northern Hubei. The Provincial Relief Committee is scheduled to hold a plenary meeting on the 11th to discuss relief for the province. The Flood Prevention Committee is also stepping up its work to reinforce the dikes. In addition, the Department of Civil Affairs issued an order on the 10th to all counties to ban slaughter for seven days to pray for rain. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Severe Heat and Drought in Various Places</h3>
<p>(Anqing) The heat has not subsided for days, and there is still no rain. Children are parading with paper dragon gods and other objects to pray for rain. Charity groups plan to hold a formal Taoist ritual to pray for rain if it does not rain again. (10th Dispatch) In Wuyuan, there has been no rain for a month, and the weather is exceptionally dry. The fields are scorched yellow, and the heat is unbearable. If it does not rain this week, the early rice harvest will be hopeless. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been severely dry with little rainfall. However, the soybeans and wheat planted in the counties north of the Yangtze River have already been harvested. Although rice is also planted in the counties south of the river, it can be irrigated with river water, and a good harvest can be expected if there is no flooding. However, in the counties south of the Yangtze River, the farmland is cracked, and the rice seedlings are withered, resulting in a disaster. Reports are being submitted to the provincial government, requesting a reduction in taxes. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yantai) A heat wave started here yesterday afternoon. At 3:00 PM today, the Customs thermometer read 102.2 degrees. Two people died from heatstroke. The beaches are extremely crowded, as bathing can slightly reduce the sultriness. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although the temperature here today is lower than yesterday, residents are still sweating profusely. Sixteen people have died from heatstroke in the past three days, mostly workers. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to the continuous heat in Beiping in recent days, the number of sudden deaths among citizens in the past three days has reached sixteen. All were due to heatstroke and lack of timely medical treatment. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Harbin to Be Flooded Again</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The waterways of northern Manchuria continue to rise. With the recent frequent heavy rains, Harbin is in danger of being flooded. The local authorities have recently received instructions from Changchun, ordering them to do everything possible to protect the entire town. As a result, a committee was formed. The first meeting resolved to repair and reinforce the existing dikes, and to increase the height of the dikes around Chuanjiadian by one meter. Work has already begun day and night. If the Songhua River rises an average of four inches per day this month, the water level in August will be the same as when Harbin was flooded two years ago. The lowlands between Harbin and Qiqihar will also be flooded. Siberian trains may be suspended, and passengers traveling between Qiqihar and here will travel by motorboat, as they did two years ago. According to experts, only a prolonged drought can prevent the flooding. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Songhua River is currently rising seven inches per day. Another six feet of rise will bring it to the level of the great flood of 1932. Groups of frogs and rats are now moving to higher ground in the lowlands. The summer resort on the left bank of the Songhua River has already been flooded. The Yalu River overflowed, destroying the levee near Niangzishan (transliteration), and east-west traffic on the Chinese Eastern Railway is now suspended. With frequent and unrelenting heavy rains, all rivers are rising. Authorities now believe that the flood of 1932 may recur. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Old Course of the Yellow River Ceases to Rise</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water level in the old course of the Yellow River in Xuzhou has stopped rising for days, but there is no sign of receding. Residents on both banks are in a watery land. The authorities have sent personnel to investigate the downstream and plan for repairs and relief. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Plague Discovered in Changchun</h3>
<p>(Dalian) According to news from Shenyang, plague, commonly known as the Black Death, has been discovered in Changchun. Eighteen people have already died. The disease is also present in Beiying Tala (transliteration) near Changchun, with fifteen patients. Doctors have rushed to the affected area in the hope of preventing its spread. Plague broke out after the floods in northern Manchuria in 1932, causing many deaths. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Question of Establishing Customs and Postal Services After the Opening of the Beiping-Shenyang Railway</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Qi Wendun, the Commissioner of Customs in Qinhuangdao, arrived in Yuguan on the 8th to meet with Yiwo, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency, to discuss the establishment of a branch customs office in Yuguan. Since the housing and everything else in Shanhaiguan has not been prepared, the original plan was to establish it on the 20th, but it is now feared that this will not be possible in time. It will be established together with the other customs offices along the Great Wall. The Qinhuangdao Customs has been ordered to send personnel to the five ports of the Great Wall to find housing and prepare everything. Housing is scarce in Lengkou, making it difficult to find. If necessary, it may be set up in nearby villages. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The puppet Rehe postal district has established a postal administration in Duolun to handle postal services in eastern Mongolia and communication and liaison within the puppet state. The puppet Ministry of Communications also plans to set up a wireless radio station in Duolun to receive and transmit telegrams and broadcast news favorable to the puppet state to eastern Mongolia. The puppet state has recently reduced its expenditures, and all post offices along the Great Wall, except for the Beikou and Shanhaiguan post offices, have been withdrawn. Communication services in areas with Japanese military posts are the responsibility of the communication squads. Postal Director Hui Jianting of the Hebei Postal Administration said that the rumor that postal services had actually been opened after the opening of the railway was inaccurate. Currently, mail from China to Western Europe is still being transported by sea. Incoming mail from outside the customs is still subject to postage surcharges. The mail cars attached to the railway only transport mail within the customs area and have nothing to do with postal services with areas outside the customs. The Beiping-Shenyang postal chop is an old one, which is the stamp used to collect mail on the mail car and is not used on the Beiping-Shenyang express train. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tibet in the Future</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>Tibet is the western border defense of our country and the hub of Sichuan, Kangding, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. Its gains and losses, existence and demise, are of utmost importance. However, since the 13th Dalai Lama returned to Tibet from India in the first year of the Republic of China and regained power, relations between China and Tibet have been less than satisfactory. Last winter, the Dalai Lama passed away, and the people of the country generally believed that a good opportunity to solve the Tibet problem had arrived. If it could be handled properly, restoring governance and consolidating territory would not be difficult. What is worrying is that the Tibetan people have a deep-rooted belief in religion, which has grown stronger over time. It is said that the 13th Dalai Lama was the last in his system. After his death, he will not be reincarnated. There have been thirteen Dalai Lamas since Zongkapa's chief disciple, Baogenba, which is the appropriate number. Solving the issue of succession after this will inevitably lead to many disputes. Although it has been heard that the Lhasa side has already decided on the candidate for the 14th Dalai Lama, the matter is secret and not credible. In the past, before the Qing Dynasty fell, there was still the so-called Golden Urn system. If there were differences in the mutual reporting of living Buddhas being born, the names would be put in urns, sutras would be chanted to summon the gods, and the resident minister in Tibet would draw the lot, which would be considered the true reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. Now, even this is gone, and there is no way to convince the hearts of the entire Tibetan people. Since the first year of the Republic of China, Tibet has been a state where politics and religion are united. The 13th Dalai Lama controlled all power and was considered supreme. If the succession issue is not resolved, the future of Tibet will contain a great crisis. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>Even if the 14th Dalai Lama has already been born and his qualifications for election have been determined, according to the Tibetan system, he must be twenty years old before he can assume the official position of religious leader. During this twenty-year transition period, someone must act as regent. After the Dalai Lama died last winter, all Tibetan political affairs were handled by the Tibetan king (Silon) named Yaoqi Lengqing. The Silon is intelligent and capable, and his ideas are similar to those of the Dalai Lama. Although he would not be considered absolutely anti-Chinese, he also has no great affection for us. At the end of February this year, there was news that Jiezere Renzhen Khutuktu, a Tibetan monk, secular official, and civil engineer, was acting as the Tibetan regent. The National Government has approved the conferment of titles. From this, it can be seen that changes must have taken place in the Tibetan political situation. However, the road is long and the truth is difficult to know. Leaving aside Jiezere's personality, it is a fact that many of the military leaders in the regency government are students who have studied in England. Their pro-British inclinations have always been strong, and their leader, Commander Longxia, is clearly a pioneer of British influence. Fortunately, news came in May of this year that Longxia's conspiracy was exposed, and he was executed. Since then, there has been a sudden hope of closer relations between China and Tibet.</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with the inside story of the Tibetan situation knows that there are three major factions. The first is the Dalai Lama faction, the second is the Panchen Lama faction, and the third is the neutral faction. The attitude of the neutral faction is not worth discussing, as they are all powerless monks and laity. Within the Dalai Lama faction, there is a conservative faction and a pro-British faction. The conservative faction has its own unique approach and does not interfere with the world. The pro-British faction, due to Longxia's execution, may not dare to act rashly for the time being. The Panchen Lama faction is biased towards being pro-Chinese and has a long history with the pro-Chinese factions of the three major monasteries in Tibet: Zhebang, Sera, and Ganden. At the beginning of this year, representatives of the three major monasteries went to the central government to request five things, the main points of which were to escort the Panchen Lama back to Tibet, eliminate villains, and improve politics. The power of the three major monasteries in both political and religious aspects cannot be underestimated. (During the Dalai Lama's large-scale attack on Qinghai and Xikang twenty years ago, he issued a universal conscription order, but was opposed by the three major monasteries. He had no choice but to leave Lhasa and flee, and finally expressed his surrender, expelling his pro-war confidants before he could stop). Now that the Panchen Lama has their support to enter Tibet, it will be much more convenient. Moreover, according to Lamaist doctrine, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama serve as teachers to each other in reincarnation. If the 14th Dalai Lama already exists, then the Panchen Lama will hold the position of teacher upon entering Tibet. Even if political power is in the hands of the "Silon" or Jiezere Renzhen, the religious power undoubtedly belongs to the Panchen Lama. In Tibet, religious power can dominate politics. As the Panchen Lama also said, to solve Tibetan affairs, politics must be promoted through religion. If so, then the return of the Panchen Lama will bring about significant progress in relations between China and Tibet. This is not wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Now, the Panchen Lama, who has been lingering in Beijing and Shanghai, has gone north. Beforehand, there was talk of going to Qinghai to propagate and returning to Tibet in the fall. Huang Musong, the special envoy sent by the National Government to pay tribute to the Dalai Lama, has also crossed the Jinsha River and is not far from Lhasa. This means that the signs of a turning point in the Tibetan situation have already appeared, which is certainly credible. However, the Tibet problem is a major outstanding case of the past twenty years. It is intricate and difficult to resolve. Sending personnel to maintain relations for such a major problem is futile. Acting too hastily may cause things to backfire. Escorting the Panchen Lama back to Tibet has already been a set policy, and efforts must be made to realize it. This goes without saying. However, the fundamental policy still needs to be decided. It is heard that the central government has repeatedly discussed this issue. The general idea is to retain the power over foreign affairs, national defense, and international trade, while other political and religious issues will be handled by the Tibetan government itself. In view of the mistakes of sending troops into Tibet in the late Qing Dynasty, it is advocated to restore the office of the resident minister in Tibet without sending troops. Regarding the transportation from Lhasa to Chengdu and Qinghai, it is planned to complete it as soon as possible. Under the current circumstances, we agree with all these principles. The only question is how to implement them. British influence has enveloped all of Tibet for many years. All aspects, such as postal services, telecommunications, forestry, mining, finance, transportation, military affairs, and the police, are controlled by them. Even the potential power of Russia and Japan has a considerable presence. (For example, the Tibetan military flag was surveyed and drawn by the Japanese Aokiji Bunkyou.) Looking around, others have taken the lead and continue to advance. If our plans remain empty words and we do not know how to implement them, I am afraid that the opportunity will be difficult to come by again. A slight negligence will result in loss.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Publishes Documents Exchanged Between El Salvador and the Puppet State</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the League of Nations published documents exchanged between El Salvador and "Manchukuo." These documents were submitted to the League of Nations by El Salvador at the request of Secretary-General Avenol.

<h3>Barthou's Diplomatic Success: Anglo-French Talks Conclude, Security Plan Receives British Support, Britain Does Not Oppose Russia Joining the League of Nations, French Naval Chief Remains in London to Discuss Naval Issues</h3>
<p>(London) The Anglo-French talks officially concluded today. A communiqué stated that the results of the talks were completely satisfactory. The scope of discussions between British Foreign Secretary Simon and French Foreign Minister Barthou and other key officials from both governments was very broad. An official statement issued here today stated that the friendly talks between the British and French Foreign Ministers concluded this morning at the Foreign Office. These discussions enabled the two governments to better understand each other's views on various issues. The issues discussed were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) France's proposals to enhance mutual security in Eastern Europe. (2) The future of the Disarmament Conference. (3) Preparations for the 1935 Naval Conference.</p>
<p>French Naval Chief Pietri will remain in London for several days to discuss naval issues. (National News dispatch, 10th) (London) After the recent talks between British and French cabinet members, if we want to understand the results, we can summarize them as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Britain's objections to the mutual assistance pact have been eliminated, and the mutual assistance pact has received the support of the British cabinet. (2) Britain will endeavor to secure support for the mutual assistance pact in the capitals of all relevant countries, to the extent that British influence can reach.</p>
<p>(3) Britain does not oppose the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(4) Anglo-French relations have been strengthened, and mutual trust has increased. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) French Foreign Minister Barthou left London at 4:30 pm today. Before his departure, he met with Davis, the US representative to the Disarmament Conference and naval preparatory talks, to discuss matters. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The purpose of French Foreign Minister Barthou's visit to London is widely believed to be to obtain a commitment from Britain that, should France unfortunately go to war with Germany in the future, Britain would still assist France. However, Barthou himself denied this claim. Today, after British Foreign Secretary Simon met with Barthou, a communiqué was issued stating that the nature of the talks was very harmonious. They exchanged views on issues of common interest to both countries in Europe. The talks continued in the afternoon, and French Naval Chief Pietri and the British First Lord of the Admiralty also met at the Admiralty to consider preparations for the naval conference. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Explaining Security, British Doubts Dissipate</h3>
<p>(London) This morning, the plenary meeting of British and French representatives lasted for three hours. It has now been verified that British and French views on the "Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact" plan have converged. According to the Security Committee of the Disarmament Conference, the resolution proposed by the committee chairman, Politis, was passed a few days ago, advocating that countries conclude regional mutual assistance pacts based on the Locarno Treaty and the Balkan Pact to mutually guarantee security. This resolution is sufficient to provide a basis for the discussions between British and French cabinet members this time and provides strong support for France's proposal. This is why British and French cabinet members have reached a consensus. The subsequent discussions on naval and air force issues are also related to this issue. Although this exchange of views was quite in-depth, it was still limited to generalities, which shows that British and French concerns are completely the same. Therefore, regarding the methods used to safeguard peace, the two countries are also roughly in agreement. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a dispatch from the London correspondent of Le Petit Parisien, after French Foreign Minister Barthou explained French policy to the British authorities, most of the British government's doubts have been dispelled. It also stated that this policy should be considered in a friendly manner and there is no reason why it cannot be understood. Britain's efforts to understand, as well as the Eastern Locarno Treaty plan, will not only not suffer from British opposition in the future, but will also not suffer from British indifference, which is a natural thing and not surprising. However, the extent to which Britain agrees with this plan and the form in which Britain will actually give it its support is still difficult to say at this time. Le Journal reported that (yesterday's talks were cordial and sincere,) and also said that both Britain and France want to consolidate peace, and soon we will see that relations between the two countries are becoming closer and more beneficial to the peace policy. The views of the Paris ○ voice on consolidating peace and 日益日益 between the two countries can be roughly summarized as follows: (1) Britain will not participate in the new plan for the mutual assistance pact. (2) Britain may not insist on its own views regarding the difficulty of reconciling the mutual assistance pact with the Locarno Treaty. (3) Britain was originally extremely worried about the rapprochement between France and Russia. After Barthou's explanation, the British authorities have recognized that our intention is to stabilize the situation in Europe and there are no other concerns. (4) For the above reasons, Britain maintains a favorable bystander attitude towards the mutual assistance pact plan. In short, the results of yesterday's talks between British and French cabinet members were extremely satisfactory. The press did not initially expect it to be so quick. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Britain's Concern: Maintaining the Principle of Neutrality</h3>
<p>(London) Today at noon, the British government hosted a banquet for French Foreign Minister Barthou and Naval Chief Pietri, and the discussions were very harmonious and pleasant. There were no speeches during the banquet. At 3:30 pm, the representatives of the two countries resumed talks at the Foreign Office. The foreign ministers of the two countries exchanged views on European issues. French Naval Chief Pietri and British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell also met at the Admiralty to discuss preparations for the naval conference. Today's talks were completed at 6:30 pm. There will still be meetings in the future. French Foreign Minister Barthou will explain the nature and purpose of the regional agreements advocated by his country one by one. It is generally believed that this policy has been fully approved by Britain. In the near future, the British government may also explain Britain's support for France's policy to the governments of the countries concerned, but this does not mean that Britain will provide some new promises. The French representatives do not expect this from Britain. What they hope for in London is only that it will clearly support France's desire to stabilize Europe. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored here tonight that, when French Foreign Minister Barthou met with British representatives, both sides paid special attention to the mutual assistance treaty plan. Among them, the mutual assistance treaty in the northeastern region of Europe has been studied at length. This treaty is based on the current mutual assistance pact of the Baltic Sea countries and will include France, Poland, and Soviet Russia, but not Britain. As for the supplementary establishment of a Mediterranean regional convention, it does not seem to have been discussed jointly. What British cabinet members are particularly concerned about is what London calls the "principle of neutrality." According to British sources, the above-mentioned mutual assistance treaty is based on this principle. We believe that Barthou has given the necessary comfort to the British side, because British cabinet members have, after all, approved of France's proposal to conclude a mutual assistance treaty. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Visits Chairman of the Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>(London) French Foreign Minister Barthou and the Director of the French League of Nations Secretariat, Massigli, went to the residence of the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, this morning to consult with Henderson. After 10:30 am, Barthou, accompanied by the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, and the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Léger, went to the Foreign Office, and soon French Naval Minister Pietri also arrived to hold talks with Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden. Before the talks, Léger had preliminary talks with the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Vansittart, at the Prime Minister's residence. The scope of the talks this morning seemed to be exclusively about various issues related to disarmament. As for the issue of guaranteeing security with a mutual assistance pact, most of it had been discussed during yesterday's meeting and will be discussed again when acting Prime Minister Baldwin hosts a banquet for the French cabinet members this afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Naval Chief Remains in England to Discuss Naval Issues, Requests Expansion of Conference Scope, French Statement Denies This Intention</h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, after today's 后后会商后, French Naval Chief Pietri has decided to remain in London for a few days after Foreign Minister Barthou leaves England on Tuesday. The release of the news that Pietri's stay in England has been extended has been interpreted as indicating that Pietri and British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell have decided that the naval conference next year still needs to be discussed at length, even though Italy's recent announcement of its plan to build two new 35,000-ton battleships has made the future of the conference even more difficult. (National News dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Navy issued a communiqué, stating that a certain newspaper carried a report this morning, saying that the French government intends to request that the scope of the 1935 naval conference be expanded so that more countries can participate. The newspaper also said that Naval Minister Pietri advocates that Germany should be allowed to participate in some kind of talks from now on. This news is completely unfounded, because the Navy Department has never made such a statement. This is specially declared. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese New Cabinet Gathers All Its Strength to Deal with the Naval Conference, Sends Colonel Iwashita to England</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, in view of the fact that the preliminary negotiations in London will begin to be discussed concretely this autumn, and in order to concentrate on these negotiations, is said to be working hard to resolve the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway and demanding that the Russian side make a final concession proposal. If no headway can be made in the short term, it will be ignored and the Kwantung Army will be allowed to take action. (Chinese United Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government believes that the upcoming preliminary negotiations on naval disarmament in London are of great importance to the current situation, so it has decided to send Navy Colonel Iwashita to England to assist Ambassador Matsudaira. It is also necessary to fully discuss the government's instructions to Colonel Iwashita and the secret strategies for attending the meeting. Therefore, after the cabinet meeting on the 10th, Naval Minister Osumi discussed with Foreign Minister Hirota for a long time and decided to have Colonel Iwashita fully convey the response measures to Ambassador Matsudaira in order to avoid any errors in the preliminary negotiations.

<h3>British Prime Minister to Visit the New World for Meeting with Roosevelt, but Officialdom Remains Silent</h3>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister MacDonald, due to reading official documents for several hours daily, has suffered damage to his eyesight. Following medical advice, he is taking a leave of absence. It is scheduled that tomorrow, he will accompany his daughter by plane from Lossiemouth to Wicksopp in Nottingham for a short stay, then fly to Ireland, and on Thursday, take the mail ship "Belledst" to Canada. It is rumored that MacDonald plans to meet with President Roosevelt while in North America. Officialdom has remained silent on this matter, and there is no confirmation. It is noted that MacDonald is sixty-seven years old and has suffered from eye ailments for a long time. In February 1932, he underwent surgery once. MacDonald visited the United States in 1929 and wrote a book the following year titled "American Speeches." (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>(Paris) French veterans, who wield considerable influence and support Prime Minister Doumergue, suddenly issued a warning to him today, demanding that he purge corruption and maintain discipline within one month, or they will rise up in opposition. It is generally believed that this blow will not cause significant damage to the Doumergue government. However, if unexpected disputes arise, it could be a fatal blow to the government.

<h3>German Deputy Chancellor von Papen Interrogated, Guards Surround Residence, Parliament to Convene on Friday, Hitler to Give Speech</h3>

The German Parliament will convene on Friday, at which time German Chancellor Hitler will deliver a speech explaining the recent execution of party members and reiterating Germany's peaceful policies. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>British and French Newspapers Mock Hess's Declaration as Warmongering to Divert National Attention, No More Than Antony's Eulogy</h3>
<p>(London) The Times expressed no surprise at the declaration made by Hitler's representative, Hess, the day before yesterday, and published the following opinion: "Hess's speech is as skillfully crafted as the eulogy given by Mark Antony for Julius Caesar. (Note: Mark Antony, who lived from 80 to 30 BC, was friendly with Julius Caesar.) On the surface, it seems to have the same effect. Hess's speech did not explain what everyone wants to know, but merely praised Hitler in grandiose terms for how strictly and resolutely he prevented chaos from emerging. In fact, who does not know these facts? There is no need for Hess to elaborate. Moreover, aren't these facts quite contradictory? Hess repeatedly stirred up the audience with patriotic words, causing listeners to be misled by patriotic rhetoric and forget the events of June 30th. And at the end of his speech, he turned to France, advocating for reconciliation. We should know that when the authorities of a violent country face internal political instability, they will falsely claim that foreign enemies are approaching in order to divert attention and eliminate internal disputes. This is the meaning of Hess's speech. We foreigners can only observe the changes in Germany with a focused mind, waiting for the German people's psychology to return to normal." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, Hitler's confidant, Hess, said in a speech at the National Socialist Party Congress in Königsberg, East Prussia, that what Germany expects is only peace, and Germany is willing to maintain good relations with France. Political observers in Paris believe that Hess made these remarks probably because he wanted to make the people forget the recent purge and because Barthou is active in London. All Parisian newspapers doubt Hess's sincerity. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since Hess, a cabinet member in charge of National Socialist Party affairs, delivered a speech in Königsberg on Sunday, all French newspapers have published it extensively. Judging by the headlines of the various newspapers, Hess's remarks seem to have been unexpected by the French. For example, the headline of "Le Matin" is as follows: "Hess's Request for Franco-German Cooperation." The newspaper's Berlin correspondent said that the most noteworthy point of Hess's speech is that many of the views expressed in it were clearly instructed by Hitler or his close associates, and that Hess's words expressed a sincere desire to establish a new relationship with France, which was also extremely evident. The headline of the "Echo de Paris," the organ of the French General Staff, on this matter is as follows: "What Does Germany Want After All? Hess's Great Speech on Pacifism. German Minister Calls on Veterans for Peace." The headline of "Victoire" is: "Hitler's Confidant Speaks Directly to France; A Surprising Speech Whose Purpose Is Undoubtedly to Divert People's Attention from Domestic Politics." The tone of "Le Journal" is: "The French should not fail to listen quietly to these ardent words. We all feel that a Franco-German alliance is of great value, but it is a pity that Germany has not first convinced us of the possibility of such an alliance, but only told us of the various benefits of the alliance." "Le Quotidien" said, "Does Hess believe that France will invade Germany by force? The French veterans certainly know that the Germans are brave fighters, but apart from this battlefield memory, perhaps there are other events that can make the two peoples on the banks of the Rhine unable to forget, that can allow the two nations to join hands." (Republic of China Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Has the National Socialist Party Changed Its Policy? Openly Viewing War as Dreadful</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German newspapers are pointing out the repercussions caused abroad by the speech delivered yesterday by Hess, the cabinet member in charge of National Socialist Party affairs on behalf of Hitler. However, the German newspapers have not mentioned the fact that this speech indicates a change in the National Socialist Party's policy and has caused surprise and shock among public opinion within Germany. The German newspapers also said that Hitler has been quite tired since the recent coup and will probably rest temporarily. The Foreign Correspondence News said that the reason why National Socialism has not been believed to be peaceful until now is due to the crimes of the various rebellious Marxists. As for now, the National Socialist Party is willing to prove to all countries its sincerity in loving peace. Moreover, in the past, the National Socialist Party prohibited mentioning the horrors of war. Now, the newspapers are openly talking about the dreadfulness of the war. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Black Shirts Replace Brown Shirts in Guarding Political Prisoner Detention Centers</h3>
<p>(Berlin) General Göring, Prime Minister of Prussia and Minister of Aviation, special black-uniformed guard force, today took over the guarding of the political prisoner detention center at Wola Fortress north of Berlin, replacing the original brown-uniformed guard force. This is probably related to rumors that the detention center is now holding hundreds of members of the Brown Shirts. It is heard that those detained are suspected of being involved in the conspiracy of Röhm, the leader of the Sturmabteilung, who has already been executed. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>One Month Leave, Steel Helmet League Prohibited from Wearing Uniforms</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Steel Helmet League, organized by veterans, has also been granted leave by the government and temporarily disbanded until August 8th. During the leave period, they are not allowed to wear uniforms. The Sturmabteilung had previously been granted leave, and now the Steel Helmet League is following suit. In this way, before the leave of these two groups expires, only the formal army and police in Germany will be able to wear uniforms. (Havas, 9th)</p>

According to a communication from the Estonian news agency, these meetings have now ended. Regarding the possibility of concluding a Baltic regional mutual assistance agreement, the meeting resulted in an understanding on the principles and methods of cooperation on foreign affairs issues that have the same importance for the three countries. At the same time, other important issues have also achieved favorable results. As for the issue of scientific cooperation, it will be studied at the next meeting.

<h3>Mussolini Emphasizes Agriculture, Personally Celebrates Harvest Festival in Pontine Reclamation Area, Threshing for One Hour Earns Six Lire</h3>
<p>Sabaudia: Prime Minister Mussolini personally threshed the first wheat in the Pontine reclamation area today, thus announcing the start of the Italian harvest season. The opening ceremony of the harvest season was preceded by a 21-gun salute. Mussolini immediately took off his hat and clothes amidst cheers and operated the threshing machine under the blazing sun for a full hour. His work was so nimble and skilled that even old farmers could not compare. After one hour of hard work, he had produced 2,400 pounds of wheat and received six lire in wages from Sun Sri, the representative of the Veterans' Association, plus 54 centesimi. Mussolini also personally drove a car to inspect various parts of the new reclamation area. Wherever he went, farmers cheered and roared with excitement. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Pontine Marshes of Italy were originally an inaccessible area. Recently, thanks to the efforts of the Italians in land reclamation, they have miraculously transformed from barren land to fertile land. Prime Minister Mussolini went to the two towns of Sabaudia and Littoria in the area today to personally preside over the opening ceremony of the harvest season, which is also the start of the national harvest season. After encouraging agriculture, the Prime Minister also told the farmers that he would come again in the autumn to celebrate the Thanksgiving Festival together. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Rome: While participating in wheat harvesting work in a village near Sabaudia, the Prime Minister said in a speech to the farmers, "Now is an important time for physical labor. If we rely entirely on mental labor, it will be harmful to the country. The strength of the Roman Empire was based on farmers. At that time, most farmers were illiterate and could not write. Later, when intellectuals gained power, the Roman national strength gradually declined." The Prime Minister worked under the harvesting machine until noon before leaving. Those present at the same time included the speakers of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the Vice Minister of the Army, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Colonies, and the secretary of the Pan-Nationalist Party.

<h3>Massive US Recovery Spending Totals Over 130 Billion Yuan, Approximately 25 Million Yuan Daily, Economic Decline Has Been Broken</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Treasury Department today released the figures for the recovery movement's expenditures for the first time. The total amount reached a staggering 13,115,535,221 US dollars. Since last summer, the speed of spending has been increasing daily, reaching 25 million dollars in mid-December of last year. This spring, it gradually decreased again, so that by the end of the fiscal year on June 30, the expenditure of all relief funds was still far less than the amount originally budgeted by President Roosevelt. Sympathizers with the government believe that the reduction in spending is because the need has also decreased, proving that the New Deal has broken the doom of economic decline. However, critics say that the government is simply using the recovery funds for political convenience, and is now retaining some surplus funds in order to spend heavily again before the congressional re-election in November. Regardless of the reason, according to the figures released today, the Treasury Department has a surplus of 6,670,675,405 dollars due to the slower pace of spending. Simultaneously with the Treasury Department's announcement, a statement was also issued by Johnsen, the director of the Recovery Administration, claiming that since February 1932, the total amount of loans provided to various industries to seek revitalization was 5,538,071,429 dollars. However, this huge amount is now being recovered successively, with approximately 3 million dollars being recovered daily. Supporters of the government also regard this as clear proof that Roosevelt's policies have had practical results. The expenditure of the Recovery Administration includes 30 billion yuan from the time of former President Hoover. A government spokesperson stated today that the recovery plan will continue actively, but because various industries have now made great progress, the remaining funds in the Treasury Department may not need to be fully used.

<p>(Washington) The government's agricultural report released today stated that the number of acres planted with cotton in the United States this year is the lowest since 1905. However, despite the large reduction, the harvest will still have a surplus, so the Bankhead Act plan may be implemented. The Department of Agriculture's report estimated that the total amount of land planted with cotton on July 1 was 28,024,000 acres, compared to 40,852,000 acres on the same day last year. If calculated based on the average cotton production per acre in the past five years, this year's production will exceed 10 million bales, which is the number limited by the Bankhead Act. The Agricultural Adjustment Committee originally intended to limit the cotton planting area this year to 36 million acres, but it has now exceeded it by 2 million acres. Therefore, it is expected that at the time of harvest, all cotton planters who exceed the limit will have to pay the special tax stipulated by the Bankhead Act. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Philippine Election, Constitutional Convention Delegates, Meeting on July 30, First Step Towards Independence</h3>
<p>(Washington) The preliminary work of establishing a new Philippine Republic under US guidance will begin tomorrow. At that time, a constitutional convention of 202 delegates will be elected to draft the constitution of the Philippine Republic. Governor General Murphy will convene the constitution on July 30 to meet in Manila. The Philippine Independence Act passed by the US Congress stipulates that the constitutional convention should be established before October 1, 1934, and the Philippine independence leaders decided to hold it earlier. Originally, it was scheduled to elect delegates to the constitutional convention on June 26, so that the constitutional convention could be convened on July 4, US Independence Day, but due to the impact of new developments, the election was slightly delayed. This election is the second election in nearly seven weeks that has shaken the Philippines. On June 5, congressmen were elected, and congressmen are scheduled to meet on July 16. The results of this election further confirm Quezon's power. Quezon is the Senate President for the independence movement and the leader of the delegation sent to Washington to demand independence. Most of the candidates running for congressmen will also participate in the election of the constitutional convention, because the two elections do not conflict. The method of distributing 202 representatives is to elect two representatives from each constituency. Representatives must have the qualifications of candidates for the House of Representatives. There is no salary for meetings, but representatives who are not paid by the government can receive 5 pesos each time they personally participate in the constitutional convention, as well as round-trip travel expenses. The total cost of this item is stipulated to be 500,000 pesos. The Philippine constitutional convention, like all constitutional conventions, is temporary in nature, but has no absolute sovereignty, because some restrictions on the constitution are stipulated by the Independence Act passed by the US Congress. The republican government will rule the Philippines during the ten-year transition period before the completion of independence. After the constitution is completed, it will exercise its power. The constitution will be voted on by the Philippine people and must be approved by the US President. Although the Philippine nationalists hope to establish a republican government on January 1, 1935, this hope is unlikely to be realized, because if the constitutional convention prolongs discussions, or President Roosevelt vetoes the constitution, the twists and turns of negotiations between Manila and Washington will delay the realization of this matter. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The steps to complete Philippine independence are as follows: (1) July 10, 1934: Election of 202 representatives to the constitutional convention. (2) July 30, 1934: The constitutional convention convenes in the House of Representatives in Manila. (3) March 24, 1936: The constitution is finalized and submitted to the US President. (4) The US President approves the constitution, but no specific time limit is set, so there is a great possibility of delaying the implementation of independence. (5) The constitution is sent to Philippine voters for voting within four months of the President's approval. (6) If the constitution is passed, preparations for the election of a new government will be made within 30 days, and the election will be held in the period from three to six months after the preparations. (7) After the constitution is voted on and returned by the United States, the US President will issue a statement ending the American government of the Philippines, and the Philippine Republic will be established. (8) Ten years after the establishment of the republican government, the United States will withdraw from the Philippines, and the republic will be completed. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Okada Cabinet Holds First Meeting, Decides on Provincial Vice Ministers</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The first cabinet meeting of the Okada Cabinet was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 am on the 10th. First, Finance Minister Fujii said to the members, "The current cabinet has not been established for long, and the budget must be based on the guidelines of the previous cabinet. Please submit the general accounting budget by August 10." Next, Prime Minister Okada reported, "The current cabinet's administrative policy is under consideration by the relevant authorities and will be announced to China and foreign countries after a decision is made." Finally, opinions were exchanged on the appointment of vice ministers of various provinces. The meeting was adjourned at 11:20 am. The vice ministers, directors-general of bureaus, and other local officials decided by the cabinet meeting are as follows: Vice Minister of Interior Shichiro Niwa, Director-General of Police Affairs Toshiki Karasawa, Director-General of Social Affairs Asaji Akagi, Governor of Saitama Prefecture Kazue Iinuma, Governor of Miyagi Prefecture Kiyoshi Hantai, Governor of Tochigi Prefecture Gunzo Kariyage, Vice Minister of Finance Juichi Tsushima, Vice Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Teiichi Nagase, Director-General of the Legislation Bureau Tokujiro Kanamori, and Sadatsugu Tsubogami, Director of Cultural Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was appointed as Vice Minister of Colonial Affairs. Satoshi Koriyama, the former Director of the Colonial Affairs Bureau, was appointed as a director of the South Manchuria Railway. The Ministry of Colonial Affairs was originally established to govern foreign administration and to realize the opinions of the various colonies at the cabinet meeting. However, after the Manchurian Incident, the policy towards Manchuria failed to treat Manchuria and other colonies with the same guidelines, and at the same time, it was necessary to make the liaison between the military and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs closer. Therefore, Prime Minister Okada did not advocate the establishment of a full-time Minister of Colonial Affairs at the time of forming the cabinet, but took on the position himself. This time, the appointment of Mr. Tsubogami, Director of Cultural Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is intended to closely connect the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military to establish a policy towards Manchuria and to change the traditional colonial administration into a new situation.

<h3>Political Corruption in Liberia, Britain and the United States Attempt to Intervene</h3>
<p>(London) The British Lower House today spoke of the situation in the West African black republic of Liberia. Lord Privy Seal Eden replied that Liberia had not fulfilled its obligations, and the League of Nations could consider excluding it from the meeting according to the covenant. Eden's words probably refer to the fact that the League of Nations Committee investigated the country's situation and found political corruption. Last month, the British government made a proposal to the US government for Anglo-American cooperation to implement a new government in the West African black republic. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Sensual Films Should Be Banned</h3>
<p>New York Catholic Jewish Joint Action</p>
<p>(New York) The Catholic Church and the Jewish Catholic Church are united in opposing indecent films. This movement is expanding daily. There are already 2 million members joining the "League of Decency." Bishop Dougherty of Philadelphia has forbidden Catholics from entering movie theaters. The Jewish Catholic authorities held a meeting to prepare to boycott indecent films. The film industry was greatly alarmed upon hearing the news and has now organized a committee to inspect all films before they are released. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3>Cotton and Wheat</h3>
<p>American Cotton: The cotton market opened as expected, with prices exceptionally high. This was due to positive Liverpool telegrams, continued unfavorable weather in the cotton belt, and strong buying interest from foreign markets and Wall Street. Although some long positions were closed, the buying volume often exceeded selling at the start, and all offerings from various sources, including the South, were absorbed by buyers.</p>
<p>English Cotton: Yesterday's cotton production report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated the cotton harvest at only 10.5 million bales. Coupled with rising cotton prices in New York yesterday, the Liverpool cotton market opened high this morning. At 1:00 PM, the October contract was at 6.56, up 20 points from yesterday's close.</p>

<p>Indian Cotton: The Bombay cotton market mirrored the world's other cotton markets this afternoon, with the price of Broach cotton for July/August delivery at 202 rupees, up 5 points from yesterday's close. European exporters were buying, and profit-taking was also evident, as many took advantage of the rising markets in New York and Liverpool to close out positions and secure profits.</p>
<h3>Rubber</h3>
<p>London Rubber Market: Conditions in the London rubber market were stable this morning. October/December contracts traded at 7 pence, 25 farthings, up 0.0625 from yesterday's close.</p>
<p>New York Rubber Market: Sentiment in the New York rubber market was cheerful and prices were stable.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Before the New York market opened, a dull market was anticipated. Interest was lacking at the beginning, and although there was some movement, it was insignificant. Those holding securities seemed unwilling to sell, and underlying, though not aggressive, investment demand seemed to be the factor maintaining market conditions. About an hour into trading, the market became more lively and prices continued to rise. This appeared to be the beginning of a favorable development, especially for securities of an expansionary nature. The New York security prices (as of 10:40 AM) are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Military Construction by Japanese Army in Jiamusi: Building Airfield, Barracks, Warehouse, and Solid Fortifications, Plus Poison Gas Training Class; Preparations Indicate It Would Be the Third Defense Line in the Event of a Russo-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Jilin: The Japanese are currently designating over ten counties east of Yilan County in Jilin as a reclamation zone, planning to relocate a large number of Japanese and Korean farmers for settlement. For long-term planning, the urban center is set at Jiamusi on the south bank of the Songhua River. A 180-mile railway extends north from there, directly reaching the Heligang coal mine in Heilongjiang. East-west transportation is frequent, with riverboats traveling between Heihe and Harbin, making travel convenient and attracting merchants. The Japanese have built a large-scale airfield outside the west gate and over 700 barracks and warehouses outside the south gate, permanently housing over 800 soldiers and eight heavy artillery pieces. In addition, there are thousands of reclamation soldiers stationed in Hunan Ying, Mengjiagang, and other locations, with several extremely solid and vast fortifications built. Underground tunnels secretly house water pipes connected to the Songhua River and branching explosive pipes. In case of war, the water supply is secured for defense, and the entire city can be destroyed in defeat, a particularly vicious plan. There is also a poison gas training class and a large stockpile of military supplies. In the event of a Russo-Japanese war, this location would serve as the third and extremely important defense line west of the same general area. Military deployments are still in progress.

<h3>On the Opening of the Ping-Shen Railway: Negotiations for the Withdrawal of Japanese Troops; Japanese Side Claims to Be Acting According to the Boxer Protocol; After Negotiations, Withdrawal Agreed to on the 8th</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: After the bombing of the train in Chadian by Yin Tong, he went to Ping immediately that afternoon and telegraphed his resignation, expressing a passive attitude. After staying in Ping for five days, he returned to Tianjin at 7:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th. However, he did not go to the railway bureau for the past two days. On the morning of the 7th, a reply telegram arrived in Tianjin from the Ministry of Railways' Comfort Group, signed by the three directors, stating: "(Director Yin Tong, Deputy Director Xu Wenguo, and Zheng ○ Zhaojue of the Beining Railway Bureau: We have received your encrypted telegram. The conspiracy to bomb the train should be strictly investigated to apprehend the perpetrators. The railway police should be responsible for ensuring strict precautions for future train operations. Your resignation is not to be discussed. You are hereby ordered to comply. (Signed) Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways." After receiving the telegram, the railway bureau immediately sent personnel to Yin's residence on Haihe Road. Yin read it without much expression. However, regarding the Ministry's order to apprehend the criminals, he instructed the railway bureau to reply in a telegram, saying that detailed measures were already in place, ordering the entire railway police force to conduct a strict search to solve the case. He also stated that since the implementation of the railway opening, railway police had been increased along all bridges and tunnels to prevent accidents, and special attention was also being paid to safety inside the trains. He did not mention whether he would resume his duties personally. A person in charge of the railway bureau stated that Yin's resumption of duties was not a problem and that he would be able to report to the bureau for work within the coming week. Recently, he wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to rest and take care of personal matters. This statement is likely reliable. Since the opening of the railway, the Japanese army has dispatched six personnel to accompany each train under the guise of "police escort." This was not part of the railway opening agreement. On the evening before the implementation of the railway opening on July 1, Staff Officer Kawaguchi from the Tianjin Japanese Army Headquarters went to the railway bureau to request permission for several soldiers from the North China Japanese Garrison Headquarters to accompany passengers back and forth, temporarily for one week. If the train runs smoothly without incident after the expiration of the period, they will be withdrawn. That same evening, Chai Shan also called from Beijing, requesting Yin Tong's permission. The Ministry of Railways telegraphed Yin Tong twice for negotiations, insisting on canceling this "police escort" to monitor the train operations. Although Yin has not resumed his duties, he cannot shirk responsibility for the matters he has handled. He has been negotiating with Chai Shan in Ping for days, and after returning to Tianjin, he negotiated with Japanese Army Chief of Staff Kikuchi. Finally, today (the 7th), the Japanese side agreed, and Kikuchi officially replied to the railway bureau in writing, stating that the "police escort" would be cancelled on the 8th. However, regarding the safety of train passengers, he instructed the Beining Railway Bureau to pay close attention. After receiving the letter, the railway bureau sent Bao Xuefan, the acting director of the car service department, to meet with Kikuchi at the Japanese army headquarters, stating that they would take full responsibility for the safety of the Ping-Shen railway. Therefore, starting from the 8th, these grotesque "police escorts" will no longer be seen on the trains. (7th)</p>
<h3>Catastrophic Floods in Guangdong's Three Rivers: East River - Water Rises Twenty Feet in Heyuan County in the Upper Reaches; West River - All Villages in Enping County Become Swamps; North River - Railway Tracks of the Zhushao Railway Washed Away by Water</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since last month, the rains have been frequent in Guangdong Province, and the three rivers, East, West, and North, have flooded simultaneously, causing losses in many areas along the rivers. The disaster situation in each area along the three rivers is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>East River</h3>
<p>Last month, there was continuous heavy rain in the area, lasting for more than ten hours a day for several weeks. As a result, the floodwaters rose sharply in both the upper and lower reaches, and the ponds and swamps in all villages were inundated. On the 21st of last month, the water rose more than twenty feet in Heyuan County in the upper reaches. Huiyang and Boluo in the lower reaches were also flooded. By the 26th, the water had receded by about five feet. Unexpectedly, on the 27th, another mountain torrent occurred, and the water level rose again by three or four feet on the 28th. The low-lying areas along the river became a vast expanse of water. All highway traffic, except for the Huizhang Road, and all motor vehicles from Huizhou to Heyuan, Huizhou to Danshui, Huizhou to Shanwei, and Huiping and Huijia, etc., were suspended due to the flooding of the highways. Tens of feet of the Huiping (from Huizhou to Pingshan) highway were washed away, with more than ten breaches. Seven bridges along the road were destroyed, and the surrounding villages suffered significant losses. The Wuyatuan of the third district of Heyuan County was washed away by water on the 24th, with the dike breached by more than a foot. Fortunately, the villagers rescued it quickly, avoiding a major disaster. However, the low-lying streets along the river in the three counties of Heyuan, Huiyang, and Boluo were knee-deep in water, and people had to use boats to get around.</p>
<h3>West River</h3>
<p>The floodwaters of the West River originate in Guizhou Province. Last month, there was a flood in the Fuhe and Dahe rivers in Guizhou Province, and the water level in Wuzhou rose by three or four zhang overnight. As a result, the floodwaters of the West River in Guangdong Province rose sharply at the same time. Areas in the upper reaches, such as Deqing Douchang and Lianjiangkou, all became flooded. Areas in the lower reaches, such as Sanshui, Hekou, and Xinan towns, were flooded, and the lower floors of shops along the river in Hekou were submerged and business was suspended. Houfuwei, which is at the junction of Sanshui and Nanhai and protects more than ten villages, suddenly breached on the evening of the 20th, and floodwaters poured into the enclosure. The villagers sounded gongs in the darkness to rescue it and quickly telegraphed the River Management Association to send technicians to supervise the work. By the evening of the 27th, the base dike had been built several feet higher, and it was turned from danger to safety. The floods suffered by the counties in Siyi this time were even more serious. On the evening of the 23rd of last month, in various places on the sea surface in Xinhui, due to heavy rain and floodwaters arriving at the same time, Huandong Road and Qujiatang in the city all became flooded, with the ground being three or four feet deep in water. The Xinhuai Railway Station was also flooded. In Chikan, Kaiping County, floodwaters overtopped the embankment and flooded the streets three feet deep from the evening of the 21st to the 23rd. Boats and rafts were washed away by water, and many shops collapsed. Enping County suddenly reported a flood on the 24th and 25th of last month, with the water rising more than two zhang. Residents have never had flood control equipment, so once the flood came, transportation was blocked, all households ran out of food, and cries shook the sky. More than 30 houses collapsed. The South Gate Bridge in the county seat, which is more than 400 feet long and built of reinforced concrete, was incomparably strong, but it was also broken by the floodwaters this time. Towns such as Shengtang, Juntang, and Chuanjiao in the county all became flooded, the fields and crops were submerged, and the residents were sleeping on the hills. The severity of the disaster has not been seen in 60 years. Several sections of the Enkai Highway were washed away by the water. Since the 20th of last month, mountain torrents have erupted in Taishan County, flooding the entire city. The water on Nanmen Road in the city was more than one zhang deep, and the houses in the Shuigankou area of the East Gate were as high as the eaves. The department store on Taixi Road lost more than 20,000 yuan in goods, and other losses were incalculable. Many residents drowned while trying to escape the water. The Ningyang Railway bridges and various highways were all washed away by the water, and the restoration project will cost no less than 100,000 yuan. Boatmen rescued more than 30 refugees in the disaster area, and the corpses of drowned livestock floating around were shocking. The sound of houses collapsing was heard. In more than 100 large and small villages in the flood area of the county, the water was as high as the backs of the houses, and the villagers were crying out in pain as they could not escape. The Public Security Bureau used wooden rafts to rescue the refugees. Subsequent investigations revealed that 173 houses had collapsed and more than 300 mu of fields had been washed away.</p>
<h3>North River</h3>
<p>Since the 23rd of last month, mountain torrents have erupted in Shaozhou, and the Zhen River and Wu River have risen by more than one zhang. The Zhen River flooded to the outside of the South Gate, and the Wu River flooded to the parade ground. The roadbeds of the southern section of the Yuehan Railway from Shaozhou to Yingde were all washed away by water, and dangers occurred repeatedly. Fortunately, repairs were swift and no accidents occurred. On the Shaole Highway, the roadbed in front of Hepo Village collapsed for seven or eight zhang. The tracks of the Lechang section of the Zhushao Railway were also destroyed by water, and traffic has not yet been restored. As for the Xiang River basin, the villages in Qingyuan County suffered the most from the floods, with thousands of mu of fields washed away and hundreds of houses collapsed, especially in Heping, which suffered the most. The provincial government has ordered the county government to jointly raise funds with the Qingyuan Public Association and the Father to distribute relief. (6th)</p>
<h3>The Southern Route Army Recovers Important Bandit Areas; Huichang City Can Be Captured Very Soon</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: At the end of last month, the Second Division of Ye Zhao reported that communist bandits were found near Hanfang in Xinfeng. The unit immediately sent Song Tuan, the attached officer, to lead three companies to raid Yangya, 50 miles away from Hanfang, and encountered the pseudo-Independent Sixth Regiment. The bandits numbered four or five hundred and resisted stubbornly on the high mountains. After two hours of fierce fighting, the bandit position was finally broken. Five or sixty bandits were killed, two hostages were rescued, and many reactionary propaganda materials were seized. The remnants of the bandits retreated towards Yudu. As for the Second Column, the front line has now approached Huichang. The Huang Shitu Regiment of the Seventh Division of the Third Army has advanced to Baishibu. It is found that Baishibu is only 30 miles away from Huichang. At present, the troops in Junmen are engaging in road construction and grain storage. Before the general attack order is issued, they are temporarily monitoring the actions of the communist bandits outside Huichang. Currently, only the local Pacification Corps is dispatched to recover the bandit areas near Huichang. The Pacification Corps has a volunteer brigade, which immediately divided into groups to search and suppress. Soon, the important passes of Xin Kaiwei, Banjiang, and Hedun in the Luotian District, spanning seventy or eighty miles, were completely recovered. As for the pseudo-22nd Division of more than 2,000 people at Hezi Ridge, they once attacked under the cover of darkness. The Pacification Corps assisted the Huang Regiment in fighting back and fighting fiercely for one night, killing more than 400 bandits. After the bandits collapsed, more than 100 guns were captured. On the 14th of last month, the pseudo-New Third Army Corps suddenly came from Huichang, with about 4,000 bandits, attempting to invade Hedun Wei. The Volunteer Brigade of the Pacification Corps rose up again to raid and attack. The communist bandits were attacked from all sides and eventually could not hold on and fled to Wuyapo and other places. The vanguard of the Volunteer Brigade has advanced to Zhantang Wei, not far from Huichang. At present, there are no bandit traces in Huichang City. If the National Army receives an advance order, the recapture of Huichang City will be as easy as flipping one's hand. However, before the general offensive, the bandit suppression army has decided to first recover the key waterways and land routes in the bandit-connected areas within one month. In the vicinity of the bandit areas, they will prepare three months' worth of food to avoid the communist bandits' scorched earth policy. In the short term, they will first complete the construction of all highways to facilitate military transportation and support. (5th)</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Is Rising Sharply and Continuously; Shandong Province Is on Alert Day and Night Along the River</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The flood season has arrived, and the Yellow River is rising. In addition, there has been continuous rainfall in the upper reaches, so the water is rising continuously. According to a telegram from Shanzhou on the 3rd, the water level was 291.2 meters. Today (the 8th), another telegram was received, stating that the water level rose to 292.52 meters last night (the 7th), an increase of 1.32 meters. The River Affairs Bureau believes that the increased water will reach Shandong from the upper reaches within a few days, and the river works are gradually entering a tense period. Today (the 8th), although it is Sunday, the bureau is working as usual and has telegraphed all river officials and soldiers to properly prevent it. The telegram says: "The upper and lower reaches of the total and very sections are aware that the water level in Shaanxi County was 2912 on the day of the winter moon of this month and 2925 on the geng day, and the water is rising daily. You are required to supervise and strictly prevent it, and do not neglect it. Zhang Lianjia, Gengyou." After this telegram was sent, Shanzhou sent another telegram at 4:40 PM today, reporting that the water level was 293.04 meters, an increase of 5.12 centimeters compared to the 7th, and the flow rate was 4,000 cubic meters, also increased compared to the previous one, surging and turbulent, flowing straight downstream. Calculating the water's journey, it takes 14 hours for the water to reach Zhukou, 50 miles from the border of Ji Province, and 14 and a half hours from Shili Pu to Luokou in Jinan, and 9 and a half hours from Luokou to Qinghe. It takes another 10 hours to leave the border from Lijin Ninghai and enter the sea from the lower border, totaling 48 hours in and out of the province. The increased water reported in the two telegrams from yesterday and today will reach the territory of Shandong within a few days. Also, the water level at each port fell by three centimeters today, with a water level of 27.87 meters, and a large rise is expected within a few days. The highest water level in Shaanxi Prefecture in the 21st year of the Republic of China was 294.785 meters, and the highest level last year reached 297.06 meters. The current water level is 293.04 meters, which is 4.02 meters lower than last year, a far cry. However, such a sharp and continuous increase is also worrying. This year, Ji Province has heightened and thickened the Yellow River dikes, and the inner embankments on both the north and south banks of this province are 1.5 to 2 meters lower. The people of the upstream counties and the Post-Disaster Project Office of the Hebei Province River Works have sent telegrams successively to report this situation, requesting to raise the river dikes to avoid danger. The provincial government has ordered the River Affairs Bureau to review and reply. Pan Yifen, the chief of the engineering section of the River Affairs Bureau, returned to Jinan from an inspection downstream today and immediately began to review the case. Generally speaking, the upstream dikes in this province must also be raised to be the same as those in Ji Province. After the plan is approved by the provincial government, it will be implemented immediately. (8th)</p>
<h3>Henan Province: Unprecedented Flood in Yexian County | Unseen in Fifty Years |</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: I recently received news from Yexian. This year, Yexian County experienced abundant rainfall in the spring, which benefited the growth of wheat crops. However, as the harvest season approached, two instances of strong winds and one instance of heavy rain led to a poor harvest, yielding only 60-70% of the usual amount. After the wheat was brought to the threshing ground, and only half of it was threshed, there was another widespread heavy rain. Farmers were initially pleased that they could plant late autumn crops on time. But who knew that continuous rainfall would follow, causing the river water to rise and fall several times. Starting on July 1st, torrential rain poured down incessantly throughout the night. On the morning of the 2nd, the Kun River and Sanli River outside the south gate of the city overflowed, turning all low-lying areas into a swamp. By evening, the water level had not receded, and another downpour, even heavier than the previous night, arrived. On the 3rd, from the city walls, one could see an endless expanse of water, with villages resembling floating islands and wheat stacks resembling burial mounds. Boats could navigate both north and south within the city gates, and the water was knee-deep under the city gate. According to elders, this is the first major flood since the large flood in Yexian County on May 13th of the tenth year of the Guangxu reign. The sounds of houses collapsing, crying, calls for help, and lamentations filled the air. Although the Shahe River north of the city had sturdy embankments repaired two years ago, it is estimated that they cannot withstand such a rare flood. If the river bursts, the scale of the disaster will be unimaginable. (July 4th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsong: Sister-in-law Quarrel Leads to Widow Suicide</h3>
<p>Jiang Jing’an, residing in the Wu residence at Da Wu Bridge, had eight daughters and one son. His son, Song Jiu, married a Peng from this city and had two grandsons. Unfortunately, Song Jiu died of illness two years ago, leaving his widow, Peng, aged 26, vulnerable to abuse from her sisters-in-law, leading to frequent quarrels. Peng, a lone mother raising her children, felt sorrow everywhere she turned and had been unhappy for a long time. On the afternoon of the 9th, a minor incident led to a verbal altercation with her seventh sister-in-law, who made many insulting remarks. Peng suddenly became suicidal, secretly went upstairs, and ingested opium. By 12 o'clock, the poison took effect. The family mistakenly thought she had a fever and gave her medicine for fever, but her condition worsened. When a doctor was called, it was discovered that she had taken poison. The mistaken administration of fever medicine further deteriorated her condition, leading to her death. Her death was very tragic. The local police reported the incident to the court. The family requested an exemption from an autopsy, and after negotiations with the deceased's maternal family, the Jiang family agreed to provide a generous funeral.</p>
<h3>Xiaokun Robbery: Homeowner Shot</h3>
<p>At midnight on the 8th, as Yu Shaohe, a villager from Yujiahui, Thirty-second Ward, Xiaokunshan Township, was preparing to draw water, six or seven robbers wearing blue clothing and speaking a mix of local dialects suddenly entered his home. They immediately fired shots to intimidate, hitting the homeowner's eldest son, Zhongxian, who fell to the ground injured. The second son heard the noise and came out to investigate, and he was also shot by the robbers, hitting his waist. Neighbors heard the commotion and sounded the alarm. The robbers dared not linger and fled together. Villagers gathered and captured Zheng Ake, a suspected robber, who has been bound and sent to the general bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Nanhui: Attempted Rape Leads to Assault</h3>
<p>Huang Ahe, a farmer from Taojiaqiao, Thirty-first Ward, outside the West Gate, went to his field to operate a waterwheel with his wife, Chu, late the other night. Suddenly, they heard someone prying at the door and suspected a thief. They lit a fire and went out to investigate and found that Qu Asan, a known robber with a criminal record, barged in, pushed Chu into the house, and attempted to rape her. Chu struggled to escape, and Qu Asan slashed her in the left back and left hip with a knife. Chu screamed for help due to the extreme pain, and Qu Asan fled. However, Chu's family is poor and unable to file a lawsuit. Yesterday, they appealed to the First District Office and the County Women's Association for help. The district has reported the matter to the county government, requesting Qu's arrest and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Two Criminals Executed for Patricide and Filicide</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Office dispatched a prosecutor to the Third Branch Prison at 7:00 AM yesterday (the 10th) to execute Liu Ruxian, convicted of patricide, and Yuan Wanfu, convicted of filicide, by hanging. Liu Ruxian, a native of Nanjing, killed his father, Liu Dianliang, with a knife in his hometown on March 7th this year. Yuan Wanfu, a native of Rugao, was the second husband of Yang Shi. He coveted Yang Shi's property and killed Yang Shi's three sons from her previous marriage: Dacheng, Xicheng, and Chengshi. Both criminals were sentenced to death and executed yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Chen Yulin to be Tried in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Chen Yulin, former chairman of the Garment Industry Association, is suspected of inciting labor unrest and being the leader of the Axe Gang during the garment workers' strike. He was arrested by the Public Security Bureau and sent to the Zhenjiang Provincial Security Office for interrogation. Yesterday (the 10th), the county government received an order from the province to prepare a document and send personnel to the province to escort Chen to Suzhou and transfer him to the Wu County District Procuratorate for investigation according to the law.</p>
<h3>Taoist Association Holds Ritual to Pray for Rain</h3>
<p>Due to the prolonged heat and lack of rain in Suzhou, rice prices have soared, and drinking water is scarce. In addition to the meat industry voluntarily halting slaughter for seven days, starting on the 9th, the Taoist Association is conducting a grand ritual at Xuanmiao Temple to pray for rain. Because it has had little effect so far, they have set up a Bagua formation on the terrace of the Sanqing Hall, presented a blood oath, and at 1:00 PM yesterday (the 10th), twenty priests and eighty Taoist followers paraded through the city to offer incense, hoping to reach the heavens. Lawyer Zhang Yipeng spent 15,000 yuan to purchase thirty water pumps in Shanghai to provide free water pumping for the villagers. Meanwhile, the Construction Bureau sent technician Zhou Jiamin to Xumen yesterday (the 10th) to inspect the opening of a water gate. As Xumen is located west of Taihu Lake and the terrain is higher than Suzhou City, in order to prevent future floods, a water gate will still need to be installed after opening it. A budget has been prepared and submitted to the Provincial Department for review and approval.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Public Security Bureau Uncovers Opium Den</h3>
<p>Chen Yu, the head of the Public Security Bureau in Wuxi County, received a tip yesterday that Ni Ronggen, a resident near Xiaosanli Bridge outside the North Gate, is a well-known opium dealer with a thriving business and a secret operation. Based on the tip, Chief Inspector Wang and Ge led plainclothes detectives to search and arrest him. They found twenty packages of "Old Blue Red" opium, one package of "Green Soldier Ship" brand opium, and one package of Sichuan opium, totaling fifty-eight taels, at Ni's residence. They also found a large jar weighing ten taels, three opium pipes, eighteen opium bowls, two large jars of opium ash, and countless tools. The main suspect, Ni Ronggen, and accomplices Ren Qicheng and Liu Achun, were arrested and taken into custody at the bureau, pending transfer to the local court for trial.</p>
<h3>Various Public Organizations Appeal for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Property Administration Office, County Chamber of Commerce, Relief Society, and other public organizations believe that the prolonged drought has created a disaster. They urgently need to prepare for famine prevention and disaster relief. Yesterday, they jointly sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, as well as the Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Education Departments, requesting them to consider the hardships of the people and allocate the industrial and construction taxes for disaster prevention. The telegram stated: "The weather is severely dry, and the people are anxious. Local projects should prioritize the difficulties of the people. The government and the people should start anew, and it seems appropriate to focus efforts on disaster prevention and relief. We have recently seen in the newspapers that the Construction Department has stipulated four measures. Aside from paying attention to cultivating drought-resistant crop varieties, which may offer some relief, the promotion of digging artesian wells, encouraging the organization of cooperative societies to purchase water pumping machines, distributing four to eight horsepower engines at low prices, promoting large-scale afforestation, and paying attention to the protection of natural forests all show concern for the suffering of the people. However, we are afraid that these measures will be too slow and still require the people to plan on their own. The officialdom only promotes and encourages, which is beyond the capabilities of the current population. We ask that you consider the plight of the people and order the county government to allocate all industrial and construction taxes specifically for local disaster prevention. Instruct the county magistrate to coordinate with the local authorities to quickly address the disaster situation. All projects that are not essential to the people's livelihood should be temporarily suspended. In the future, attention should be paid to farmland water conservancy, so that we can start anew with the people, perhaps move Heaven, and alleviate the disaster. We await your urgent orders." At the same time, telegrams were also sent to the provincial and county governments by natives in Beijing and Shanghai, making a united appeal.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Debt-Related Humiliation Leads to Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>Fan Qinglang, a farmer from Limin Town, Sixth District, northeast area, made a living farming. His family was poor. Last spring, when food was scarce, he borrowed rice and wheat worth ten silver dollars from Zhang Yicheng, a wealthy villager, with the promise to repay it in the autumn of the same year. When the time came, a tidal wave caused a disaster, and the cotton crop failed, making it impossible to repay the debt. The other day (the 6th), Zhang went to demand payment but was unsuccessful, so he subjected Fan to a tirade of insults. Neighbors eventually intervened and persuaded him to leave. Fan was deeply affected by this humiliation and, filled with resentment, went out in secret at dawn the next day (the 7th) and drowned himself in the river. By the time his family noticed and rushed to rescue him, he was already dead.</p>
<h3>Li Dingxun Arrested for Embezzling Tax Funds</h3>
<p>Li Dingxun, director of the county tax office, was arrested for embezzling more than 4,000 yuan in tax funds. Zhu Lihe and others reported him to the Finance Department. After investigation, the allegations were found to be true, and the county was ordered to dismiss him and recover the funds. Over a year has passed, and Li has continued to delay without making any progress. The Finance Department believes that Li's embezzlement of public funds and continued failure to resolve the matter constitutes intentional defiance of the law. Yesterday, they ordered the county to arrest and detain him. The county government instructed the police to arrest Li Dingxun and detain him in the detention center, giving him one month to repay the debt in full.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: County Government Meeting on Drought Relief</h3>
<p>Magistrate Bao, concerned about the severe drought, parched fields, and the anxieties of the farmers, convened a meeting yesterday (the 9th) at 2:00 PM with personnel from various agencies and the district heads of the seven districts to discuss drought relief measures. The discussions resulted in the following: (1) Maintaining water transportation and specifying the dates for ships to enter and exit Huangtiangang to avoid disrupting the canal; (2) If there is no more rain, encourage farmers to plant by-products; (3) Raise funds through the Agricultural Bank to purchase more water pumps; (4) Prohibit raising rice prices; (5) Carefully prevent epidemics; (6) Prevent locust plagues; (7) Pay attention to saving and storing; (8) Establish more irrigation cooperatives. During the meeting, Cao Yuanmo, head of the relief society, suggested continuing the ban on slaughter and praying for rain, as well as extending the time for monks and Taoists to chant scriptures and perform rituals, in order to move Heaven and bring down rain. This proposal was rejected by the majority. The meeting adjourned around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Suicide by Drowning After Job Search Fails</h3>
<p>Shen Shanming from the North Gate of this county comes from a well-established family. He is in his thirties. He worked as an elementary school teacher in this county for many years. His family was originally wealthy, but due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy in recent years, their income was insufficient to cover expenses. He went to the Hangzhou Municipal Government to seek a position through his relatives, hoping to make a living. Unfortunately, in these times of overstaffing, he was unable to find a position after spending half a month in Hangzhou. Running out of funds, he suddenly went to the Qiantang Riverbank on the afternoon of the other day, taking advantage of the crowds, and jumped into the river in an attempt to end his life. Many tourists were on the riverbank and saw Shen jump into the river. They quickly reported it to the police, who rescued Shen. The police chief at the Fifth Public Security Bureau questioned him and offered kind words of comfort, before sending him to a certain gentleman at the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Citywide Teahouse Strike Continues</h3>
<p>The teahouses in the city have been on strike for over a week in protest against the county government's additional levy of a teacup tax for the Security Corps. Representatives of the teahouse industry have repeatedly petitioned the provincial government and the county government and party headquarters, but to no avail. They held an emergency meeting and decided to continue the strike until the end. County Magistrate Yang Zhanchun, out of consideration for the merchants' difficulties, repeatedly tried to persuade the representatives of the industry to resume business. However, due to the large number of people involved in the industry and their differing opinions, it was largely ineffective. The Provincial Security Office, viewing the teahouse strike as a form of coercion, ordered the county government to investigate and severely punish those involved. The county government, fearing that drastic measures would incite unrest, asked the County Chamber of Commerce to consider the situation and avoid hasty action. This morning, industry representatives Xue Buqing and others visited Sun Yancai, chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, asking him to appeal to the county government to allow the teacup tax to be changed to a table tax. If this is allowed, all members will resume business. Otherwise, the strike will continue.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Disarmament of Yu Dong Militia</h3>
<p>The provincial government sent personnel to Tong to lead the county police force to disarm the Yudong Tangjiagou Militia, resulting in a conflict. After mediation by local gentry, 100+ firearms of the militia had been examined, but only the licenses were collected. The provincial government demanded the surrender of four key representatives of the militia, Tang Dazong, Tang Caizong, Tang Xianchen, and Jiang Zhaoxian, to be sent to the provincial government for resolution. Chen Youqi, director of the Yudong District, and Ding Ziyan, director of the Yuyi District, who were implicated in the case, have also been sent to the provincial government. Their duties are being temporarily performed by assistant clerks Chen Buwei and Chen Moxi, appointed by the county government.</p>
<h3>Abbot of Langshan Again Accused</h3>
<p>Bao Leng, the abbot of Langshan, was previously involved in a prostitution lawsuit and fined 300 yuan by the court. On the 9th, Sha Jin and others accused the monk of licentiousness and illegal activities to the county government. The court ordered Bao Leng to undergo a test for opium addiction before further investigation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Canal Works Bureau Clears the Tongyang Canal</h3>
<p>Xu Dingkang, director of the Jiangbei Canal Works Bureau, believes that the Jiegou and Rugao Baipu sections of the Tongyang Canal have long been prone to siltation. The recent drought and shallow water have made transportation particularly difficult. He drafted a dredging plan and submitted it to the provincial government for approval. Approval has reportedly been granted. The bureau has appointed Zhang Fangyun to lead surveyors Xue Jiegang and Feng Tian to conduct surveys of the shallow sections in order to begin dredging. Zhang and others are reportedly preparing the plan and will depart soon.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Bandits Loot District Headquarters</h3>
<p>On the morning of the other day (the 6th) at around 8:00 AM, more than 100 bandits, fully armed, suddenly arrived at the Seventh District Headquarters. They confiscated the weapons of the guards and then entered and looted over 30 rifles and box cannons. They also went to the home of Gui Youmu, the head of the district, and looted everything, causing losses of over 20,000 yuan. They also kidnapped Gui's sisters (both of whom were married, one to a Han and one to a Ju), as well as his sister-in-law and two guards, totaling five people. Gui has reported the incident to the county government, and County Magistrate Cao has ordered the police to suppress the bandits.</p>
<h3>Hailstorm in the Seventh District</h3>
<p>In the Seventh District of this county, around Fanchuan Town and Donghui Town, the weather was extremely hot on the afternoon of the other day. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, and a strong northeast wind rose. Soon, thunder and rain were accompanied by hail. The hailstones were as small as soybeans and as large as chicken eggs. Fortunately, it did not last long. However, many residents' homes were destroyed, and the crops suffered significant damage.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Young Couple Attempts Suicide by Poison in Hotel</h3>
<p>Wang Guorong, a 19-year-old youth from Shanghai who worked as a railway craftsman, and Chen Xuezhen, an 18-year-old girl who was a driver's daughter, checked into the West Lake Hotel on Hubin Road in Hangzhou. Wang's father, Wang Zhuting, owned a bamboo shop on Baoshan Road in Shanghai. Wang and Chen fell in love. However, one was a married man, and the other was a married woman. Their feelings were passionate, but their families disapproved, leading them to despair. They traveled to Hangzhou, checked into Room 59 of the hotel, and swallowed a large amount of opium to commit suicide. The bellhop discovered them, reported it to the police, and they were sent to the hospital for treatment. Wang Guorong died at 2:00 PM the next afternoon due to severe poisoning. Chen Xuezhen, whose poisoning was less severe, recovered.</p>
<h3>Laundry Worker Electrocuted</h3>
<p>Xu Xingsheng, a 34-year-old tea server from the Zizhulin Temple in Lingyin, Deqing Xinshi, was electrocuted while ironing laundry at 5:00 PM on the 9th. He carelessly touched the electrical outlet and collapsed. The abbot, Mingjing, noticed and rushed him to the West Lake Sanatorium for treatment, but he died on the way. The incident was reported to the Tiacao Temple, and the police were notified to transport the body to the courthouse for inspection and burial.</p>

<h3>Drought Disaster Alert: Inland Waterway Ships Suspended, Disaster in Pudong, Locusts Found in Liyang</h3>
<p>Due to the prolonged lack of rain, various places are suffering from drought, withering crops, and drying rivers. A drought disaster has occurred, and the future is critical. Excerpts are provided below for the authorities to review and seek relief measures.</p>
<h3>Ship Suspension</h3>
<p>Due to the hot and arid conditions, and the low water level, larger inland waterway vessels have already been completely suspended, causing hardship to travelers. Smaller steamers operating from this city to Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Kunshan, Huzhou, Shengze, Xiashi, and other places were barely able to operate due to the wider waterways. According to news from the Inland Navigation Bureau, the bureau's steamer to Xiashi has been temporarily suspended since the other day due to the impact of the hot weather and shallow water. It will resume its original schedule once the river water rises. It is said that if there is no rain in the next few days in Huzhou, Shengze, Zhenze, and other places, they will also be suspended.</p>
<h3>Drought Conditions in Pudong</h3>
<p>According to people coming to Shanghai from Pudong yesterday, the prolonged lack of rain has led to severe drought, drying river ports, withering crops, and cattle unable to handle the task of water pumping. Therefore, many farmers have come to Shanghai to purchase motors and machines to transport to their hometowns for water pumping. Yesterday, three to four machines were seen being transported from Shanghai. Rice seedlings in the fields have already withered and been harvested, and cotton seedlings have also withered. With the government not providing emergency assistance, a state of neglect has formed, and the farmers are without a means of living.</p>
<h3>Liyang Locust Plague</h3>
<p>Locusts, unseen for many years, have suddenly appeared due to the recent severe drought. According to visitors from Liyang, locusts are densely distributed across the four rural districts, flying in swarms and settling in fields, devouring crops and causing damage. Neighboring areas such as Yixing, Lishui, and Gaochun counties have also occasionally spotted them, but not as many as Liyang. The ignorant farmers, seeing them descending and darkening the sky, burn incense and pray they will not harm their fields, not daring to exterminate them. Currently, the county government has organized locust eradication teams, earnestly explaining the situation and cooperating with the people to vigorously exterminate the locusts. However, due to the excessive number of locusts, it is difficult to see any effect. If this continues to spread, it is truly worrying.</p>
<h3>Drought Has Formed, Weather Remains Scorching, Hurricane Progressing Slowly</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the scorching weather in the city has lasted for over ten days. Drought has already formed in the rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, with no hope of rain in sight, and heatwaves continue to engulf Shanghai. The intense heat has not subsided. Although there was a slight decrease a couple of days ago, it has gradually increased since the day before yesterday. According to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday, the highest temperature yesterday was 101.8 degrees, and the lowest was 79.2 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 98.4 degrees and the lowest was 76.8 degrees. Therefore, yesterday's highest temperature was only slightly lower than the previous heatwave peak of 102.7 degrees. As a result, the city was again enveloped in scorching and sultry heat yesterday. The Xujiahui Observatory previously announced that a hurricane was heading towards the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. All sectors believed that this hurricane might regulate the scorching conditions and break this heatwave, paying close attention to it. According to the observatory's report yesterday, the hurricane was still progressing slowly in the Pacific Ocean, located at 125 degrees east longitude and 16 degrees north latitude, northeast of Luzon Island, heading northwest. However, its wind circle is only 120 miles wide, so the wind force is not very strong, and the progress is not very fast. There was no change as of yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Various Charity Groups in the City Held a Meeting Yesterday to Pray for Rain, Requesting the City Government to Issue an Order to Ban Slaughter for a Week</h3>
<p>Due to the prolonged drought without rain, various charity groups in the city held a meeting at Renji Hall yesterday at 5:00 PM to discuss the matter. Those in attendance included: Ni Rongtai from the Qianye Gongyi Association, Ding Zhongying from the Guangyi Chinese Medicine Hospital, Wu Songshou from the Tongyi Charity Association, Fei Jintang from the Weizhong Charity Hall, Hu Houan from the Lianyi Charity Association, Yang Xinzheng from the Vagrant Vocational Training Center, Wang Zhaogu from the Chinese Buddhist Association, Weng Yinchu from the Lianyi Charity Association, Zhang Xianqing from the Chinese Jisheng Association, Wang Junsheng from the Pushan Villa, Wang Binyan and Cai Yuanfu from the Zhabei Charity Group, Shen Jianhou from the Puji Charity Association, Zhu Baiseng from the World Buddhist Laymen's Forest, Zhang Kuishi from the Yuyingtang, Chen Wentang from the Disability Institute, Wang Zhongfu from the Chinese Relief Association for Women and Children and the Guangyi Charity Hall, Sun Yishan from the Hunan Charity Association, Fang Zhijun from the Renji Charity Hall, Chen Kaifeng from the Renji Yuyingtang, Guan Jiongzhi from the Buddhist Association, Zhao Puchu from the Buddhist Pure Land Society, Qin Yanqi from the Charity Group, Qin Yanqi from the Tongren Fuyuan Hall, Xu Qianlin from the Moral General Association, He Zhongtan from the Brigade Dharma Assembly, Guo Xiaoquan from the Shanghai Hospital, Ye Fengmin from the Women's Education and Rehabilitation Center, Han Huiqing from the Buddhist Lotus Society, Qu Wenliu from the Xinwei Relief Association, Gu Wengzhou from the Junshan Hall, and more than 50 others. Chaired by Huang Hanzhi, it was resolved that various charity groups would pray for rain for seven days at the Siming Public Hall from the second day of the sixth lunar month (i.e., the 13th) to the eighth day, and petition the city government to issue an order to ban slaughter throughout the city for one week. A petition was also submitted to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments to similarly ban slaughter and pray for rain (details omitted). The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Farmers' Association Sent Representatives to the City Government to Petition for the Implementation of Drought Prevention and to Request that Banks Be Contacted for Loans for Relief, and Will Hold a Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Disaster Prevention Measures</h3>
<p>The Municipal Farmers' Association, noting the scorching weather and prolonged drought, and the resulting signs of disaster, previously submitted a proposal to the city government with measures for drought prevention and disaster relief. Yesterday morning, they again sent representatives to visit Mayor Wu, requesting prompt implementation and requesting that the Shanghai banking community be contacted to provide loans to farmers for relief. In order to promote the drought prevention movement, the association has specifically scheduled a general meeting of farmer representatives from all districts of the city for 2:00 PM tomorrow to discuss implementation measures. The following is a report by a reporter from the Dagong News Agency on the situation.</p>
<h3>Representatives Sent to Petition the City Government Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Municipal Farmers' Association sent Secretary-General Yu Zhenhui and Secretary Pan Hongding to visit Mayor Wu at the city government in the central district, requesting the prompt implementation of the Farmers' Association's proposed drought relief and disaster prevention plan to avert any possible disaster. As Mayor Wu and Secretary-General Yu were attending a municipal meeting, they instead sent Secretary Guo Shihui to receive them. The Secretary-General reported on the disaster situation in each district of the city, requesting the city government to promptly implement drought prevention measures. Secretary Guo replied that the drought prevention plan had already been submitted to the mayor for review and would be submitted to the relevant authorities for discussion within a few days. This concerns the city's agricultural production, and the municipal authorities are determined to provide relief through practical measures.</p>
<h3>Requesting Loans from the Banking Community for Relief</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of timely rain and the drying up of rivers in the agricultural areas of the city, crops are withering and dying. The disaster situation is unprecedented in recent years, and farmers are filled with worry. In order to seek fundamental relief, the Municipal Farmers' Association has specifically requested the city government to contact the banking community to negotiate loans for the purchase of new water-lifting machines and the dredging of rivers everywhere. A loan plan is currently being drafted and will be formally submitted to the Shanghai banking community for negotiation after approval by the city government.</p>
<h3>Convening a Meeting of Representatives from Various Districts</h3>
<p>The Municipal Farmers' Association issued an emergency notice yesterday, stating: This summer, the weather is extremely dry, with little rainfall. Crops in the fields are in dire need of water. Due to the lack of timely rain and the drying up of rivers, irrigation is impossible, fields are cracking, and crops are withering. The signs of disaster are clear, and a poor harvest is feared. In view of this, the Association has drafted proposals for drought relief and disaster prevention and submitted them to the city government for approval. As this concerns the livelihood of farmers, the Farmers' Association has a non-delegable responsibility. Therefore, a joint emergency meeting of representatives from all district farmers' associations will be held at the Association's office at 6:00 PM on the 12th of this month to discuss implementation measures for drought relief and disaster prevention. It is hoped that each district will send two representatives to attend on time and share their insights. This is of utmost importance. This notice is hereby given.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Went to Qingdao Yesterday to Escape the Heat, Temporarily Changed to the Xin Shengjing Ship</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council, originally planned to take the Puan ship to Qingdao on the 3rd of this month to escape the heat, but due to scheduling conflicts, he changed his plans and left Shanghai yesterday. The original reservation on the Puan ship was temporarily changed to the Taikoo's Xin Shengjing. Many people came to see him off. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Temporary Change of Ship: Song Ziwen originally planned to depart on the China Merchants' Puan ship, and the cabin had been reserved. However, as the Puan ship departed at 9:00 AM, Song felt he did not have enough time and notified them of the change, taking the Taikoo company's Xin Shengjing instead, as the Xin Shengjing departed four hours later than the Puan. The Puan ship was also fully booked this time, with the largest number of passengers being from the Gengkuan Committee of the Commodity Inspection Bureau. Zhao Zhiyou, the head of the Yangtze River Waterway Commission, also took this ship to Qingdao.</p>
<p>Song and Others Boarded the Ship: At 11:45 AM yesterday, Mr. Song Ziwen, accompanied by secretaries Chen Kangqi and Xie Xie, and five others in total, arrived at the Taikoo company's wharf in the French Concession in three cars to board the ship. Taikoo had been notified in advance by Mr. Song and had prepared three first-class cabins on the Xin Shengjing for Mr. Song and his entourage. When the cars arrived at the wharf, the wharf was already under guard. Mr. Bulong, the general manager of Taikoo, and Yang Shaonan, the head of the Chinese shipping affairs, were both at the wharf to welcome and accompany them onto the ship. Those Seeing Him Off: Those who came to the Taikoo wharf yesterday to see Mr. Song off included Zhu Jiahao, Minister of Transportation, Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, Wei Jingzhou, Director of the Mint, and Zhang Fuyun, former Commissioner of Customs. They had all arrived at the wharf in advance to wait. When Mr. Song arrived, they accompanied him onto the ship. It is said that Mr. Song will stay in Qingdao for a month, and his wife and daughter have already arrived in Qingdao. At 12:00 PM, those seeing him off went ashore, and the Xin Shengjing left Shanghai amidst the sound of the ship's whistle. As he left the port, Mr. Song nodded to those seeing him off to indicate his farewell.</p>
<h3>Strike Wave at the Dayang Bridge in Zhabei, Sun Guifang, Manager of Hesheng Rice Store, Severely Beaten, General Strike and Request for Assistance from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, etc., Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Grain Guild to Hold Meeting Today to Discuss Measures</h3>
<p>The Shendao News Agency (local news) reports that soldiers from the security team stationed at the Dayang Bridge in Zhabei had a dispute with the Hesheng Rice Store over the purchase of rice, resulting in a mob attack and the severe beating of the store owner, Sun Guifang (currently residing at Baolong Hospital). This has triggered a city-wide strike by merchants and residents in the area. The strike has been ongoing since the 9th. Today, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Rice Guild will convene an emergency meeting to discuss assisting the beaten merchants and demanding that the authorities punish the perpetrators. The Shendao News Agency reporter drove to the Dayang Bridge to investigate the details of the strike. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Origin of the Strike</h3>
<p>The Dayang Bridge commercial district in Zhabei is known for its prosperity, and the residents are wealthy and respectable. However, due to its location on a major transportation route, security is essential. The city government has specifically dispatched a team from the Second Regiment, First Battalion, and Second Company of the Security Force to be stationed at the Yangzhou Public Hall in Tanjia Bridge. The soldiers and civilians have always been able to coexist peacefully. Unexpectedly, at approximately 10:00 AM on the 7th, a cook from the stationed team went to the Hesheng Rice Store to buy two dou of rice to take back to the team. After a while, he claimed that the weight was insufficient and immediately banged on the counter and smashed things, shouting loudly. He then gathered seven or eight soldiers, who violently beat the store's clerk, Wang Yuru. A few minutes later, a second batch of more than ten soldiers arrived, carrying wooden-cased rifles, rushed into the store, destroyed all the belongings, and tied up and severely beat the manager, Sun Guifang.</p>
<h3>Strike Process</h3>
<p>Merchants and residents throughout the city were shocked and indescribably panicked upon hearing the news. Furthermore, as Sun Guifang was a fair and just merchant who had served as the chairman of the town's Chamber of Commerce for many years and was highly respected by the merchants and residents of the city, everyone was indignant at this unprovoked beating. That afternoon, a city-wide merchants' and residents' meeting was convened to discuss the aftermath. It was resolved that: (1) a petition would be submitted to Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Security Director Yang Hu, demanding that the perpetrators be punished according to the law; (2) all shops in the city would go on strike from the 9th and would not reopen until a satisfactory resolution was reached; (3) the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Grain Guild would be requested to provide unanimous assistance.</p>
<h3>Industry Assistance</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Grain Guild, the Rice Store Guild, etc., issued separate notices after receiving reports and requests for assistance from the merchants and residents of Dayang Bridge. They will convene a meeting of standing executive committee members this afternoon to discuss assistance measures. Several representatives from the town's merchants and residents have also been dispatched to present the full situation at the meeting.</p>
<h3>Beaten and Injured</h3>
<p>A total of three people were beaten and injured by the soldiers at the time. The injuries are as follows: (1) Wang Yuru, 25 years old, local, clerk at Hesheng Rice Store, injuries to the face and waist, bleeding heavily, bandaged by a nearby doctor and recuperating at home. (2) Sun Guifang, 30 years old, manager of Hesheng Rice Store, chairman of the Dayang Bridge Chamber of Commerce, injuries to the waist, back, and arms, bleeding heavily, face swollen, currently being treated at Baolong Hospital, No. 114.</p>
<h3>Petition for Punishment</h3>
<p>Sun Guifang, the injured party, submitted a petition to the city government and the security department yesterday, demanding that the perpetrators be punished. The original text reads: Petition for the Unvented Enmity, Provocation, and Destruction of Commerce, None More So. May Your Honor Review and Grant Investigation According to Law, to Maintain Military Discipline and Maintain the Commerce and People's Affairs. The Merchant Store Has Been Open at Dayang Bridge for Years, With an Average Daily Sale of 60-70 Shi of Rice, and No One Has Ever Said That the Sheng and Dou Were Short. However, Captain Bu, the Captain of the Second Company, First Battalion, and Second Regiment of the Security Force Stationed at the Yangzhou Public Hall in Tanjia Bridge, Was Greatly Dissatisfied When He Failed to Borrow Rice From the Store Last Year. He Has Been Hostile Since Then and Has Repeatedly Let Soldiers Make Trouble, But We Have Always Responded With Tolerance. At 11:00 AM Yesterday Morning, the Team's Cook Came Again to Buy Two Dou of Rice. About an Hour Later, He Returned, Saying That the Rice Was Insufficient in Weight, Banging on the Counter and Smashed Things, Shouting Loudly. He Then Gathered Seven or Eight Soldiers and Even Used Force, Violently Beating the Clerk Wang Ruyu. He Was Beaten and Injured in the Face and Other Places and Was Tied Up and Taken Away. Later, Inspector Zhang Went to Guarantee His Release. Knowing We Had Suffered a Loss, How Dare We Argue. Unexpectedly, More Than Ten Soldiers Came Again After a While, Carrying Wooden-Cased Rifles, Rushing Into the Store, and Without Asking Right or Wrong, They Immediately Arrested and Beat the Merchants, and Used Ropes to Tie Them Up and Take Them to the Team, Beating Them Along the Way. The Waist, Back, Arms, and Other Parts Were All Beaten and Injured. This Is the Most Strange Injustice That Has Ever Happened in Our Lives. Our Store Operates the Rice Business With Utmost Fairness and Has Long Been Trusted by the Citizens. But Only the Security Force Said That There Was a Shortage of Rice. The Situation Here Is Obvious. Local Officials Are Supposed to Protect the People, But Now We Are Being Crushed and Destroyed. How Can We Endure This Injustice. We Have Submitted This Document to Your Honor, Asking Your Honor to Understand the People's Difficulties and Provide Protection, Punish the Perpetrators According to Law, and We Will Be Grateful Beyond Words. Respectfully Presented to the Shanghai Security Department, Presented by Sun Guifang, Co-signed by Yongcheng Hardware Store,</p>
<p>Xindingxing South Goods Store, Yiheju Restaurant, Shuangfeng Tea Store, Quansentai Store, Shunxingzhai Store, Hengdachang Lumber Store, Zhenfeng Brick and Tile Store, Yufeng Store, Shengping Store, Xiexing Dyeing Workshop, Wanyuxing Store, Shunchang Firm, Taili, Zhang Zhenxing, Tongxing Pawnshop, Lixing Rice Store.</p>

<h3>Guard Car Derailed</h3>
<p>When the freight train arrived at the Maigen Road Junction Station, it was routinely reversed and driven into the warehouse yard for unloading. Yesterday morning, the train was scheduled to back into the seventh track, but the foremost guard car No. 9102 (the last car of the train) suddenly moved towards the fifth track, while the cars behind the guard car continued to move towards the seventh track, causing the guard car to immediately derail and overturn.</p>
<h3>Station Worker Killed Tragically</h3>
<p>When the guard car overturned, a station worker named Tang Jinchu jumped off the car in a hurry, causing his entire body to be crushed under the car, his brains splattered, and he died instantly. Two train police officers named Chen and Yang were also in the guard car. Fortunately, they quickly jumped off the other side of the overturned car and only suffered minor injuries.</p>
<h3>Repaired Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>After the accident, the relevant personnel from the car and machine departments of the railway supervised the workers to rush to repair it. A crane was also dispatched from the Wusong Machine Factory to lift the overturned car back onto the track, and the damaged sleepers and rails were replaced. The work was not completed until 11:10 AM yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Locomotive Derailed</h3>
<p>At approximately 2:30 AM yesterday morning, a switching locomotive No. A51 at the Shanghai North Station yard of the railway also completely derailed at switch No. 23.

<p>Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by night express train from Beijing the night before last. After getting off at the North Station at 7:30 AM yesterday morning, he took a car directly to Jing'an Villa for rest. According to his family members speaking to a reporter from the Xinhua News Agency, President Yu came to Shanghai this time to have Dr. Zhang examine his body. Although the stroke that Mr. Yu suffered previously has been cured, his mouth is currently slightly crooked, and his eyes are constantly tearing. Therefore, he came to Shanghai specifically to seek medical treatment, and he will return to Beijing in about two or three days.</p>
<h3>Navy, Five Students Went to England Yesterday, Headquarters Staff and Others Went to See Them Off</h3>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy, specially selected students Liu Ronglin, Lin Baoke, You Boxuan, Gao Zhongsheng, and Zheng Tianjie to study in England in order to cultivate naval talent. The British Navy Department has expressed its approval, so the Ministry of the Navy specifically ordered the First Fleet Headquarters in Shanghai to handle the various procedures for going abroad. All procedures have been completed. The Ministry of the Navy issued each person with travel expenses, ship fare, and 104 British pounds, plus 20 pounds per person for incidental expenses along the way. All of the above have been received, so Liu and the other four were accompanied to the Pootung Blue Funnel Dock by Li Baoqi, a staff officer of the First Fleet Headquarters, Chen Daxian, the head of the Ordnance Division, and others at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to board the British Shipping Company's Rasputai liner to leave Shanghai.

<h3>Song Ziwen Raised 1.5 Million to Relief Rural Areas in the Northwest, The Money Will Be Remitted Soon, Northwest Rural Cooperative Association to Be Established to Assist</h3>
<p>The Xinxin News Agency reports that Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council, deeply felt that the rural economies in various places were on the verge of bankruptcy during his previous inspection of the Northwest, and specially proposed relief to the Economic Council. It is heard that 1.5 million yuan has been raised and will be remitted soon. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Fundraising Process</h3>
<p>After Song Ziwen completed his inspection of the Northwest and returned south, he deeply felt that the rural economies in various places in the Northwest were on the verge of bankruptcy. In order to provide relief, he specifically proposed to the Economic Council that funds be allocated for relief, and at the same time, he consulted with the Shanghai banking community to invest in the Northwest. The Economic Council then resolved to allocate 200,000 yuan for rural relief funds. In addition, Mr. Song himself raised 500,000 yuan, and the Shanghai banking community also agreed to invest 1 million yuan, totaling 1.7 million yuan. It is heard that the</p>
<p>money will be remitted soon.</p>
<h3>Report to Shaanxi by Telegram</h3>
<p>Mr. Song also telegraphed the Shaanxi Provincial Government to report on this matter. The Xinxin News Agency reporter has recorded the original telegram as follows: Chairman Shao Lizi Xiongjian, and forward to both Xiongjian of Hu Cheng and Wei Xi, Before, my brother discussed with you in Xi'an the plan to relieve the rural areas. In addition to the water conservancy cotton planting areas where banks have established cooperative associations to provide loans, for the non-water conservancy areas and dryland wheat farmers, the association plans to allocate some funds and the provincial government will allocate 500,000 in installments for relief. This has been submitted to and approved by the Standing Committee of the Economic Council, raising 200,000 yuan. However, the area is vast and the amount is small, which is not enough to meet the relief needs. Now, my brother is planning to raise another 500,000 yuan, for a total of 700,000 yuan. Together with the funds from the provincial government, there are already 1.2 million yuan. My brother has also made earnest presentations to various banks in Shanghai, and the banks plan to invest 1 million yuan, so there is a total of more than 2 million yuan, which will be more beneficial to the future of the rural areas in Shaanxi Province. The Economic Council has entrusted Mr. Zhang Yuanshan of the China Foreign Famine Relief Commission to be in charge of the affairs of the Northwest Rural Cooperative Association. He can go to Shaanxi in mid-July. How the Economic Council and the provincial government can cooperate to promote progress is respectfully requested for your consideration. Please discuss with Mr. Zhujun and Mr. Zhang in person, and please show me your opinions at any time. Brother Song Ziwen Seal.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Authorities Order Landowners in Zhapu to Relocate</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin News reports that the Zhejiang provincial authorities suddenly ordered the Chinese and foreign landowners in Zhapu and its surrounding areas on Sunday to relocate elsewhere within three days. A few weeks ago, the Chinese authorities issued an order prohibiting photography in the vicinity of Zhapu. On Sunday, the roads in the area were closed to traffic, causing hundreds of people to turn back. Among the foreigners with property, the largest landowners are Father Laichailisite and the Marist Brothers. The two churches they run have been located there for about 20 years, and their land is also subject to abandonment. The first to receive this news was the China Automobile Association. After hearing the news on June 29, they immediately telegraphed Nanjing to inquire, and the reply stated that they did not know about this matter. It is now heard that both churches will not relocate and have reported this intention to the authorities. When the authorities were initially asked about the reason for the relocation, they did not answer. Later, they were told that they would not relocate. The properties of both churches are registered with the French Consulate General in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Chen Xiangtao Talks About the Opening of the Ping-Shen Railway, Everything Was Prepared After Chen Arrived in Tianjin, Clear About Coming and Going, No Contracts Signed</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Chen Xiangtao, manager of the China Travel Service, was entrusted by the board of directors of the company to undertake the opening of the Ping-Shen Railway. He set off north on the 20th of last month and arrived in Tianjin on the 23rd. After meeting with Japanese personnel and personnel from the Beining Railway Bureau, Chen turned to Beiping because all the procedures had been completed by both parties in advance. He left Ping on the 4th. Chen then went to Qingdao because the company planned to set up a reception center in Qingdao. He boarded the Puan ship on the 8th and set off for Shanghai, arriving in Shanghai the night before last. Yesterday, the reporter visited Chen and asked about the opening of the railway. He spoke in detail, and it is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>The Opening Procedures Were Completed Long Ago</h3>
<p>Chen said that he originally had no intention of going north this time, but the board of directors decided to send me and a party, so I set off in a hurry. I arrived in Tianjin on the 23rd of last month and met with all parties. At that time, the so-called opening procedures had all been completed by both parties. Even the uniforms and badges of the railway staff had been made. So after arriving in Tianjin, I felt like I had nothing to do. However, I saw that both parties had set the procedures, but the accounting issues were not listed in the articles. Therefore, I immediately suggested to the authorities whether it was possible to follow the international railway convention and have each section operated by each person without settling accounts with each other. After the proposal was made, the Japanese side immediately sent a South Manchurian employee, Yamamoto, to Shanhaiguan. Our side also invited Zhang Shuiqi to negotiate. As a result, the Japanese side refused. At the same time, it was found that the accounting issue had been verbally agreed upon by both parties in Shanhaiguan before I went north. Since there was no problem, I went to Beiping. The rumors that I convened technical meetings in Tianjin are all not true.</p>
<h3>The Capital of One Million Is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Before discussing the accounting issue, I will first explain the situation of both parties. The rumors that the opening capital was set at one million taels, half of which was borne by the Japanese Tourist Bureau and the Chinese Travel Service, is also completely inaccurate. The China Travel Service only used 50,000 yuan for this. Moreover, the traffic between Guan Nei and Guan Wai is operating on a considerable scale so this is different than when it was first organized. Compare the distance of the Guan Wai section with the Guan Nei section, the difference is only a few kilometers. There are fourteen stations in Guan Wai and fourteen stations in Guan Nei. Shanhaiguan Station is a public station. These are all natural situations. For other locomotives, Shanhaiguan is the focal point, and they do not cross each other. The Guan Wai section draws two trains from South Manchuria, and the Guan Nei section draws two trains from Beining. In terms of responsibility, it can be said that there is no distinction. Therefore, for capital, with the existing scale, there is no need for this huge amount of money.</p>
<h3>Avoiding Disputes by Not Settling Accounts</h3>
<p>Regarding the reasons why the Japanese side has refused to settle accounts, the most obvious reason is to prevent future discrepancies in income and expenditure. The request for settlement arises from this. I personally suggested at the time that settlement was unnecessary because post-settlement exchange rates inside and outside the customs would inevitably be unbalanced. Furthermore, settlement requires accounting personnel, and misunderstandings are prone to arise in accounting, making future disputes unavoidable. Therefore, to avoid various troubles, I made this suggestion at the time.</p>
<h3>Truly Rare Not to Involve the "Manchu" Name</h3>
<p>In summary, the Oriental Travel Agency has been established in Shanhaiguan, and through-train services to Shenyang have been implemented. Although the initial service suffered misfortune with several carriages being destroyed, these were compensated for by the Beining Railway and services continued. I traveled north alone and returned alone.</p>
<p>During this trip, I did not sign any contracts. Previous reports claiming that the through-train plan was signed by me were entirely rumors. Therefore, with the current implementation of the through-train service, Zhang Shuiqi was appointed as the manager of the Oriental Travel Agency. The organizational structure of the Oriental Agency includes four sections: General Affairs, Accounting, Business, and Documentation. All technical staff are former Beining Railway employees. The current forced implementation of through-train services undoubtedly benefits the Japanese side in many ways. However, it is commendable that the Beining Railway authorities, under the current circumstances in the north, were able to negotiate the following: (1) Throughout the through-train negotiation, the term "Manchukuo" was never mentioned. (2) The Oriental Travel Agency must register with the Chinese government. (3) The position of manager of the Oriental Travel Agency will always be held by a Chinese national. Achieving these results is truly remarkable.</p>
<h3>Fifth Batch: Silver Transported to Britain and India, Totaling 1.5 Million Taels</h3>
<p>Shanghai's silver exports have seen four batches shipped out in the past month or so. Among them, three batches were destined for Britain and India, and one batch was shipped to the United States. The total value of silver and national currency exported has reached several tens of millions of yuan. However, foreign merchants and banks in Shanghai still hold a significant amount of silver that has not yet been declared for export and is currently being loaded onto ships. Yesterday, the fifth batch of silver, purchased by four foreign banks in the port including Anda and Great Britain, and transported to Britain and India, was entirely in the form of silver ingots, each weighing fifty taels. These were mostly collected from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Henan Province and transported to Shanghai. Three hundred boxes were loaded for export, totaling 1.5 million taels, bound for London and Mumbai, transported by the Great Britain Company's mail ship "Lykensport." Armed police and detectives were dispatched to protect the silver during transport from the banks to the customs wharf and onto the mail ship. At 2:00 PM, the silver was loaded onto the British ship and departed Shanghai for Britain and India. According to reliable sources, a sixth batch of substantial silver will be shipped out of the country this month.</p>
<h3>Reduced Chinese Tea Exports to Russia: Intense Competition from Indian, Ceylon, and Japanese Tea: Chinese Nationals Should Pay Attention and Make Improvements</h3>
<p>According to Ji Zejin, director of the Guidance Division of the International Trade Bureau, the main exports from China to Russia over the years have been soybeans, soybean oil, and tea. China has consistently maintained a trade surplus with Russia. Since the September 18th Incident, the export of soybeans and soybean oil is no longer under our control, and the result will be a shift from a surplus to a deficit. Today, when we talk about trade with Russia, we are only talking about tea.</p>
<h3>Russia is the Only Market for Tea</h3>
<p>Chinese tea has always been a major export commodity in foreign trade. Although substantial amounts are sold to Africa, Britain, and the United States annually, the largest market overall is the Soviet Union. Therefore, Chinese tea exports to Russia are not only important in the trade between the two countries, but also the Soviet Union ranks first among the countries to which Chinese tea is exported.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Poor Sales of Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union purchases a substantial amount of tea from various countries each year, but only about half is imported from China. The reasons why Chinese tea cannot sell well in Russia are similar to those in other countries. In recent years, Indian, Ceylon, and Japanese tea have advanced rapidly, encroaching on China's sales in the international market. Among the Chinese tea exports to Russia, in addition to brick tea, other types such as green tea and black tea have been taken over by Indian, Ceylon, and Japanese tea. Since the loss of the Northeast, soybean exports have been cut off, and tea, the only export commodity, is in an unfavorable position. This is indeed a matter of concern for trade with Russia.</p>
<h3>Methods to Salvage Chinese Tea Exports to Russia</h3>
<p>Russians like to drink tea, and they especially welcome Chinese tea. Recently, the Soviet Union has been trying to grow tea in the Caucasus region, but the quality is poor and the yield is limited, so they still rely on foreign supplies.</p>
<p>According to Soviet customs statistics, the annual import of tea is 10,000 to 20,000 tons, which is not enough to meet the national consumption. However, Soviet foreign trade is monopolized by the state, and all imports are controlled and restricted by the state. If China could supply all the tea used in the Soviet Union's national market, it could more than compensate for the losses caused by the reduced export of soybeans. There are many reasons for the decline in Chinese tea exports to Russia, but one of the main reasons is that the Soviet Union can get credit from other countries when buying goods, while Chinese tea merchants lack capital and do not offer credit. Therefore, the Soviet Union abandons China and turns to countries that offer better terms. This is a major obstacle to Chinese tea exports to Russia, and I hope that Chinese people will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>French Naval Commander Paid a Visit to Mayor Wu Yesterday: Mr. Wu Scheduled to Return the Visit Within Days</h3>
<p>The newly appointed French Far East Fleet Commander, Richard, arrived in Shanghai from France last week to take office. At 11:00 AM yesterday, accompanied by the French Consul General in Shanghai, Meillerais, and secretaries and staff officers, he traveled in three cars, each flying the French flag, to the city center to visit Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng. Mr. Wu personally greeted them and offered champagne. The Municipal Government specially dispatched a platoon of security guards to present arms at the entrance of the Municipal Government building. They exchanged pleasantries briefly and departed after about fifteen minutes. It is reported that Mayor Wu plans to return the visit within days, accompanied by his secretary, Tang Shixuan.</p>
<h3>Secretary of the Embassy in Russia, Wei Gensheng, Returned to His Post Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Wei Gensheng, Secretary of our country's embassy in Russia, who had previously taken leave to return home to attend to personal matters, completed his official duties at 9:00 AM yesterday and departed Shanghai for Japan aboard the Shanghai Maru of the Japan Mail Steamship Company, from where he will travel to Moscow to resume his duties.</p>
<h3>Dependents of Li Du's Former Troops Still Unable to Go to Xinjiang: Li Asks the Central Government for a Solution</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, General Li Du previously went to Nanjing to ask the central government for instructions on how to send the dependents of his former troops to Xinjiang. The central government stipulated that the dependents of the generals residing in Beijing and Shanghai should first be sent to Suiyuan, and then from Suiyuan Province to Ningxia, and then from Ningxia Province to Dihua. It is now learned that the central government received a telegram from Sheng Shicai, the Border Defense Commissioner of Xinjiang Province, stating that transportation from Ningxia to Dihua is inconvenient, and the route is exceptionally desolate, making protection difficult. Therefore, the dispatch of the dependents of Li's troops to Xinjiang has been suspended again. General Li has telegraphed the central government again, requesting that a proper solution be devised so that the dependents of all the generals can go to Xinjiang as soon as possible.</p>
<p>General Li Du has been suffering from heatstroke and severe boils on his back due to the hot weather in Shanghai in recent days. He is currently receiving medical treatment. Mr. Li originally planned to leave Shanghai for a cool place for a short stay, but he has been unable to do so because the dependents of his former troops have not yet been properly settled.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Further Discusses with the Telephone Bureau to Improve Communication Between the Chinese and Foreign Concessions</h3>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, regarding the request from various industries to improve communication between the Chinese and foreign concessions, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to all parties, requesting prompt improvements. It is reported that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau has indicated that, within the realm of possibility, for the sake of facilitating the public and promoting commerce, it can comply. However, the foreign concession telephone company stated that, according to the terms of the communication agreement between the Chinese and foreign concessions signed on April 19th of last year, one provision stipulates that "a permanent contract must be agreed upon by all three parties within the validity period of this contract." Before the permanent contract is established, the company cannot arbitrarily change what is stipulated in the temporary contract, but it is very willing to establish a permanent contract as soon as possible. Based on this, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce again sent a letter to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau yesterday, urging it to negotiate a solution with the company as soon as possible in order to facilitate communication.</p>
<h3>Li Yanlu Has Returned North: Because Wang is in Tianjin, He Did Not Go to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Mr. Li Yanlu, Chief Commander of General Wang Delin's Vanguard Force, arrived in Shanghai, etc. Li has already met with General Li Zhi the day before, and discussed the matter of escorting the dependents of Wang's troops to Xinjiang. Having completed his business and learning that General Wang Delin had long left Guangdong and is now in Tianjin, there was no need for him to travel south. He took the Beijing-Shanghai express train north at 9:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Cables the Legislative Yuan: Please Expedite the Enactment of the Commercial Registration Law: Approve Representatives from Chambers of Commerce in Various Ports to Attend Discussions</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce cabled the Legislative Yuan yesterday (salutation omitted): Recently, the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram stating that, in August of last year, the association deemed that the provisions of Article 681 of the Civil Code's Law of Obligations, which stated that partnership debts are jointly and severally liable, were not in accordance with commercial practice. The association requested that the Legislative Yuan approve its amendment. The reply instructed that it be referred to the Civil Law Committee for reference. In October, a letter was received from the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, conveying the President's instruction that the case had been submitted for review and did not require amendment, but that a commercial registration law could be enacted to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>The association then sent a letter stating that the consent of the highest commercial organization must be obtained when the law is decided, and requested the Legislative Yuan to approve the association to send representatives to attend the meeting when the commercial registration law is decided to provide consultation. It has been more than half a year since the case was assigned to the Civil Law and Commercial Law committees to jointly draft the law, and there has been no report of a proposal being discussed. If the provisions of joint and several liability for partnership debts cannot be remedied, the central organization of the country's commerce, which has historical significance, will be in a state of flux. Looking at the future, we are filled with trepidation. The issue was raised at the fourth meeting of the association on June 25th, and it was unanimously resolved to telegraph the Legislative Yuan, requesting that the commercial registration law be discussed and decided as soon as possible so that the partners of partnership businesses can all be the subjects of rights and obligations, act according to contract, and share according to their shares, which is not contrary to the meaning of legal balance. We also earnestly request that the consent of the highest commercial organization be obtained when deciding the law to remedy the situation and meet commercial practice, etc. We are specially recording this case and requesting the Legislative Yuan to consider and approve it and expedite the decision and promulgation of the law. We are filled with anticipation, etc. Article 681 of the Civil Code has many obstacles for commercial practice. Since your esteemed institute does not allow for amendment, the only way to remedy its defects is to rely on the commercial registration law. This type of partnership organization accounts for the majority of the country's commerce. Since there are obstacles, it has a great impact on commerce. We should telegraph our request to your seat for review, asking you to forward it and expedite the decision and enactment of the commercial registration law, and to allow the association and the chambers of commerce in various districts and ports to send representatives to attend the meeting in order to remedy the situation and achieve perfection. We are extremely hopeful. National Chamber of Commerce, humbly bowed.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Replies to the Chamber of Commerce: Foreign Sugar Tax Referred to the Tariff Commission for Study</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from Qinlian sugar merchants requesting that it be forwarded to the government, requesting that the import tax on foreign sugar not be reduced in order to protect domestic sugar. After it was forwarded to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, a reply was received from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which stated that it had received the telegram. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce had previously received a memorandum from overseas Chinese merchant Huang Jiangquan and had forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for consideration. After approval, it was submitted to the National Tariff Commission for study, etc. In addition to informing you of the handling process, it has already been submitted for filing, and you should wait for the Ministry of Finance to issue a ruling. This batch.</p>
<h3>Payment for Aircraft Nos. 2 Roads Cleared</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Preparatory Committee for Air Defense Funds for the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Roads previously purchased an aircraft from the China Aviation Association and donated it to the government. The price of the aircraft was US$22,227. The Public Welfare Committee of the two roads previously resolved to allocate funds from the committee's fund. An initial payment of 35,000 national currency was made. Subsequently, due to the exchange rate of the US dollar, it repeatedly corresponded without settling. Recently, Lin Wo of the China Aviation Association sent a letter to the Two Roads Bureau, requesting that another 35,000 yuan be paid from the aircraft price, making a total of 70,000 yuan, in order to close the account. The bureau agreed and ordered the accounting office to allocate the funds and send them to the general affairs section for payment. The Public Welfare Committee and the Preparatory Committee for Air Defense Funds were notified.</p>

<h3>Lang Zuyin Still Refuses to Appear After Summons: Cai Yangqi's Case Postponed Again: Adjourned to the 24th of this Month for Trial</h3>
<p>Lang Zuyin, a Chinese detective in the Old Gate Police Station, was sued by Cai Fan, the wife of Cai Yangqi, alleging that he used electric shocks to force a confession from her husband, Cai Yangqi, causing him serious injuries. The First Special District Court opened hearings several times, but was unable to investigate because Lang Zuyin refused to appear after being summoned. Yesterday afternoon, when the date for the hearing arrived again, only the second defendant, Bao Defu, the owner of Longshun Company where Cai Yangqi worked, appeared in court to await questioning. Judge Liu Yugui announced that after the previous hearing, Cai Yangqi was sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for examination. The institute has now sent the examination report, which is very detailed and extremely complex. The lawyer representing the plaintiff may come to the court tomorrow morning to request to inspect it. As for the defendant Lang Zuyin, who has repeatedly refused to appear after being summoned, the court has already contacted the Municipal Council, hoping that the Municipal Council will respect the spirit of the agreement and promptly order Lang Zuyin to appear in court so that the trial can proceed according to law and avoid delays. However, the Municipal Council has not responded to the court's protest, and the defendant has still not appeared, so the trial could not proceed. Therefore, the hearing is adjourned again to the afternoon of July 24th, and a summons will be issued again, etc. The plaintiff's lawyer requested that the witness Yao Xiangwai, who was now in court, be examined first. Judge Liu questioned Yao, who testified that he and Cai were in the same trade and knew that Cai was healthy and had never had hemoptysis, etc. After he finished speaking, he withdrew, and the case was postponed again.</p>
<h3>Case of the Grave Robbery of Ji Juemi's Ancestral Tomb: The Main Offender Continued to be Tried Yesterday: The Police Have Now Filed a Lawsuit: Suzhou's Request for Transfer Denied</h3>
<p>Ji Juemi, a native of Xuzhou and the manager of the Hardoon Foreign Firm on Nanjing Road, was originally a descendant of the Pan family. From November of last year to March of this year, the ancestral tomb in his hometown was excavated by local bandits, who took the remains of his father and aunt and hid them. They sent five letters to Ji in succession, threatening him to redeem them for 200,000 yuan, otherwise they would burn the bones to ashes and take drastic measures. It was recently discovered that the leader of the bandits, Zhang Huaiqing (also known as Gu Xinzai), a native of Xuzhou, 32 years old, was staying at the Wuxi Railway Hotel to negotiate the matter. Ji sent representatives Pan Litian and Zhu Benqing to trick him into coming to Shanghai on the 2nd of this month and temporarily housed him in a house at No. 1252 Fuxu Road. Meanwhile, Liu Wenzao, the Chinese detective chief of the Yangshupu Police Station, and Zhu Benqing pretended to agree to pay 2,000 yuan as a down payment. When they handed him a package containing both counterfeit and real money, they arrested him and sent him to the First Special District Court. He refused to confess and was sent back for further investigation. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui presided over the continuation of the trial in the third criminal court. Li Zhishan, the lawyer for the Municipal Council, filed a public prosecution on charges of grave robbing, intimidation, and fraud. He also stated that during the adjournment, it was discovered that the defendant had come to Shanghai from Wuxi in October of last year and had stayed overnight at the home of Jie Qingsan (alias Zhang Jinzhai), a Chinese detective at No. 95 Xinzha Road, searching for a relative of the Wu family, a woman from Xuzhou who was a tenant there. He did not know what was going on. Now, the Chinese detective is present in court to testify that the defendant's name was Zhang Yongzhai and that he said he worked for the Wuxi Public Security Bureau. He left the next morning, etc. Ji's nephew, Pan Yanqing, testified that the defendant was indeed the bandit leader Zhang Huaiqing, also known as Jinzhai. He was certain that he excavated the grave, stole the bones, and demanded money in November of last year and March of this year. When questioned, the defendant firmly denied excavating the grave, stealing the bones, and demanding money, saying that he had stayed overnight at the home of a relative surnamed Lu on Xinzha Road in October of last year because he had come to Shanghai to sell wine. He returned to Zhenjiang the next morning and had never worked for the Wuxi Public Security Bureau. The rest of his statements were evasive. Song Zhongli, an adjutant from the Xuzhou Garrison Headquarters, delivered a letter from a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting that the defendant be transferred. The court asked</p>
<p>Adjutant Song whether the defendant had committed other crimes in Xuzhou. He replied that he did not know. Judge Liu Yugui announced that the police station had filed a public prosecution against the defendant for grave robbing, stealing corpses, intimidation, and fraud. Therefore, there was no need to transfer him. He would be tried according to law. He then ruled that the defendant be detained, and the trial was adjourned for further investigation. He also told Adjutant Song that if it was discovered that the defendant had committed other serious crimes in his hometown, another letter could be sent requesting his transfer.</p>
<h3>Ye Shantao: Forgery of Documents: Retrial Sentenced to Three Months Imprisonment with Two Years Probation</h3>
<p>Ye Shantao, a director of Gongfa Company, forged a letter from Huang Chu Jiu approving his resignation as a director in order to evade the company's responsibility for debt to depositors of the bankrupt Riye Bank. He presented the letter as evidence during the court's hearing of the depositors' lawsuit against the shareholders and directors of the company for repayment of deposits in order to evade debt. The plaintiffs noticed this trick and filed a criminal self-accusation against Ye in the First Special District Court for forging documents. The initial trial resulted in Ye Shantao being declared not guilty.</p>
<p>However, the plaintiffs were not satisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. After the court's review, it was determined that the letter presented by Ye Shantao was not actually written by Huang Chu Jiu. The original judgment was overturned, and Ye was sentenced to three months' imprisonment. However, considering that he was a substantial businessman and had not previously committed any crimes, a lenient sentence of two years' probation was granted.</p>
<h3>Swindling Gang Rampant: Manager of Tongchang Grocery Store Unrepentant: Repeatedly Acting as Banker and Shaking the Stall, Resulting in Huge Losses</h3>
<p>Using gambling to swindle money is known as swindling. This type of swindling gang has never disappeared from Shanghai. The gang's organization is quite tight, and there is a gang leader who leads the swindling. Shen Ping, who was executed years ago for kidnapping and extortion, served as the gang leader for a long time. After Shen's death, according to insiders, Xiao Zhang from Shaoxing is highly qualified and may be hoping to be supported by the gang members. However, Xiao Zhang has been losing frequently in recent years. Last month, he was even involved in a lawsuit due to an "vomit back" (i.e., the jargon for spitting back the swindled money) conflict, so he has been keeping a low profile recently. In addition to Xiao Zhang, Wang Lizhong from Ningbo is also an excellent swindler. Wang has been doing this for many years, and there are many men and women in Shanghai and Ningbo who have been deceived by him. Wang once lost in Shanghai and was detained by the police and sent to the First Special District Court, where he was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. He was later granted amnesty, shortening</p>
<h3>Prison Life</h3>
<p>By a considerable amount. However, after his release, he still found deception easy and lucrative. He did not want to change his ways, so he soon went to the Yong River and swindled a large sum of money from a woman named Xu Wu. When the woman realized it, he had already fled to Shanghai. Recently, the woman heard that he was hiding in Shanghai and followed him there, staying temporarily at the Oriental Hotel. She reported to the police, requesting an investigation. It was only a matter of time before he was arrested for another swindling case. Wang Lizhong and his gang members learned that Bao Jintai, a Fujianese manager of Tongchang Grocery Store at No. 12 Dasheng Lane, Xiaodongmen, was quite wealthy and liked to gamble. They ordered two members of his gang, both surnamed Zheng from Fujian, to visit Bao at Tongchang on July 3rd. After meeting, the two Zhengs claimed that they had been</p>
<h3>Doing Business in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>In the grocery business and were now accompanying their boss, Mr. Yang, to Shanghai to buy goods. They were staying in Room 513 of the Grand Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road. The boss has a friend, Mr. Duan, who speaks highly of you and specially introduced us to purchase goods from your store. If you do not mind the small transaction, we would like to ask you to visit our residence at 11:00 AM tomorrow morning to contact our landlord, etc. Although Bao had never met the two Zhengs before, he was happy to agree because he knew that they were from the same hometown, had a friend as an intermediary, and were discussing business. The next morning, Bao went as agreed. When he entered the room, the two Zhengs were very welcoming. During the conversation, Bao asked where their boss was. Zheng said that their boss was addicted to gambling and</p>
<p>Had Been Gambling With Friends</p>
<p>Every Night Since Arriving in Shanghai. He Was Still Asleep in Another Room. He said that the Boss Was A Wealthy Merchant in Hong Kong,</p>
<h3>Spends Money Like Dirt</h3>
<p>And Had Already Lost 3,000 yuan Without Caring. Bao then began to envy him and revealed that he was itching to try his luck. The two Zhengs, knowing that he was about to fall for their trap, said to him, "We are from the same hometown and should help each other. Our boss is addicted to gambling but not skilled. He throws money away like nothing. We might as well cooperate and try our luck. If you are interested, you must bring 1,000 yuan to enter the game at 2:00 PM this afternoon." Bao agreed to return. At that time, he went to the place,</p>
<p>Where The Boss, Mr. Yang (i.e. Wang Lizhong), Was Already Playing The Game Of Shaking The Stall In The Room, Only The Winnings Were Very Small. Seeing Bao's Arrival, Everyone Pushed Him To Be The Banker. The Two Zhengs Also Took 1,800 yuan In Cash And Merged It With Bao's 1,000 yuan, And Wang Then Took Out A Huge Bundle Of Cash From The Crate, Saying That There Was 10,000 Yuan. Since Bao Was The Banker, He Used Twelve Chips As A Gambling Tool, Dividing Them Into First, Second, Third, And Fourth Doors, Allowing</p>
<h3>Speculation And Betting</h3>
<p>When The Game Ended And Was Calculated, The Banker Lost 4,300 yuan. In Addition To The Remaining 1,000 yuan In Cash, He Still Owed 3,300 yuan. The Two Zhengs Then Said That Bao Did Not Need To Mind, And Would Try To Make Up For It. So The Next Day Bao Took Another 500 yuan In Cash. He Was Still The Banker. Because One Of The Chips Was Lost Midway During Yesterday's Gambling, He Changed The Gambling Tool To Twelve Buttons That Day, And The Guessing Method Was The Same As The First Time. But The Result Was That Bao Lost Another 3,000 yuan. In Addition To The Money He Brought, He Was In Debt For 2,500 yuan. What Was Strange Was That One Button Was Also Missing Midway Through That Day's Gambling, And The Largest Lone Bets For The Two Days Were On The "Three" Door. The Fraud Here Could Be Seen By The Discerning Person Long Ago, But Bao Was In The Game And Had Lost A Huge Amount, Which Made Him Even More Confused. At That Time, He Only Knew How</p>
<h3>Attempting to Recover Losses</h3>
<p>These individuals, not satisfied with their gains over two days, agreed to continue gambling for seven more days. After returning home, Bao mentioned his experiences to someone, who said he had been cheated. Bao then realized the truth and went to those who held power to demand the return of his losses, but Wang and the others ignored him. Bao then reported the matter to the Lao Zha police station, which sent detective Bu Zongting to arrest Wang Lizhong. The two individuals surnamed Zheng had already fled. Yesterday morning, Wang Lizhong was sent to the First Special District Local Court. After the police lawyer, Zhang Zhu, presented the case, Judge Zhan interrogated the defendant. Wang confessed to the conspiracy without hesitation and stated that the whereabouts of the two individuals surnamed Zheng could be inquired from lawyer Shen Xiaoxiang, who might know the details. The court then ordered the defendant to be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<p>, If he does not commit another crime during the probation period, the sentence may be waived. Unexpectedly, he still claimed to be dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court. Recently, the court reviewed the case file and, finding some doubts, sent the case back to the Second Branch of the High Court for a retrial. Accordingly, witnesses were summoned again for another hearing. Yesterday morning, the verdict was announced: Ye Shantao was sentenced to three months in prison with a two-year probation for using forged documents. Although the conviction seemed slightly different from before, the sentence remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Tragic Death of a Woman After Abortion: Old Woman Who Performed the Procedure Sentenced to One Year and Six Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Zhang Chenshi, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 14, Fuan Lane, Xiangshan Road, Zhabei, was married to a man surnamed Zhang. Because Zhang worked on a ship and was frequently away from home, Zhang Chenshi became lonely and acted improperly, resulting in a four-month pregnancy. However, hearing that her husband would return soon, she feared he would discover her secret. Her mother, Chen Miaoshi, took her to an old midwife, Tang Shenshi, at No. 40, Lane 1010, Haining Road, on the first of last month to request an abortion. They agreed on a fee of twelve yuan, with an initial payment of eight yuan. Shen then performed a procedure, inserting a segmented medicinal herb into Zhang Chenshi's lower body. The herb was supposed to be removed after a day and a night. However, because of discomfort, Chen removed the herb after only ten-plus hours. As a result, within a few days, Chen's abdominal pain gradually worsened. She was sent to Guangci Hospital, which notified the French Concession police. Detective Ji Xiuquan arrested Tang Shenshi, along with twenty-one segmented herbs, and brought them to the First Special Court. Because Zhang Chenshi's injuries had not healed, Tang Shenshi was ordered to be detained. All these details have been reported in this newspaper. We now know that Zhang Chenshi died on the fourth of this month due to internal injuries, fetal damage, and abdominal putrefaction, despite attempts to heal her. The body has been examined by the special court prosecutor. Yesterday morning, the police sent Tang Shenshi to the Eighth Criminal Court, and Zhang Chenshi's mother, Chen Miaoshi, was also listed as a defendant. According to police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, who presented the case, Tang Shenshi was being prosecuted under Article 306, Section 2 of the Criminal Law for causing death by abortion. Chen Miaoshi was also being prosecuted for knowingly assisting in the act and should be investigated. Tang Shenshi confessed to performing the abortion but claimed that the deceased and her mother had repeatedly requested it. When Chen Miaoshi was questioned, her statements were evasive. Judge Wu Qianqi verified the confessions and sentenced Tang Shenshi to one year and six months of imprisonment, reduced from the original sentence, for intentionally performing an abortion for profit, which resulted in the death of the woman. Chen Miaoshi was sentenced to four months of imprisonment for assisting in the abortion, with a two-year probation. The number of days of pre-trial detention would be counted at a rate of two days offsetting one day of imprisonment. The twenty-one segmented herbs were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Engineers' Association Holds Meeting to Organize and Examine Sichuan Province Report</h3>
<p>Members Have All Returned to Shanghai After Being Well-Received in Sichuan</p>
<p>Currently Engaged in Organizing Forms and Conducting Specific Research</p>
<p>The Sichuan Inspection Team of the Chinese Institute of Engineers has gradually returned to Shanghai. A *Shen Shi* reporter inquired about the details of the inspection.</p>
<p>Original Purpose of the Inspection: The team's departure was at the invitation of the Sichuan Post-War Rehabilitation Office, based on their knowledge and experience, to conduct academic research and contribute to the development of Sichuan Province. They declined all social engagements along the way and participated in the province's production conference in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Compilation of Reports: The team's inspection in Sichuan was warmly welcomed by the people of the province. Educational construction and other agencies provided full instructions and protection, reducing the difficulties of unfamiliarity. The team organized an editorial board in Sichuan, electing five members to compile the reports of each small group into a unified overall report. The investigation forms of each small group were quite detailed, including summaries, introductions, investigation content, conclusions, appendices, etc. It is heard that all members of the team have returned to Shanghai. The results of the inspection confirmed that Sichuan Province's wealth is considerable, and the prospects are promising if it can be developed. All the reports of each small group are currently being organized. By the end of August, they will be submitted to the editorial board for further refinement, and they should be ready for printing by the end of October. They will be sent to the Sichuan Military Governor's Office as a reference and basis for construction.</p>
<h3>Northern Dried Fish Boats Severely Restricted by Customs: Empty Sandboats Without Fish Are Only Allowed to Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The season for fishing in Wusong is nearing its end. This year, due to the collapse of the rural economy, business has been extremely bleak. The only hope left is dried fish, but news from the north today indicates that even that hope may be dashed. Dried fish is produced in northern ports such as Qingdao, Yingkou, Niuzhuang, and Xiaoping Island. During the summer, it is transported south for sale, which is an important part of the fishing season. The fish is clean and white, does not easily spoil, and has a delicious taste, making it popular in inland areas such as Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Jiaxing. Therefore, merchants from those areas send representatives to Wusong to purchase it. This year, due to the early heat, there is an urgent need to sell the dried fish. Merchants in inland areas have been sending inquiries. The Cuisheng, Baofeng, and Shentaitai fish shops, in response to customer requests, sent telegrams to various producers in the northern fish-producing areas. Yesterday, the reply stated that fish production this year has been greatly reduced, only about 30% of previous years, resulting in supply falling short of demand. Only half of the arriving boats (estimated to be over a hundred) have been able to load, causing panic among the remaining boats that cannot load dried fish. The producers are facing great difficulties that are not easily resolved. The reason is that after the January 28th Incident, southern merchant ships carrying goods to the north are subject to strict customs restrictions. Southern merchant ships wishing to carry goods to the north must specify the destination and the goods they intend to load, and they are not allowed to divert to other locations or carry other types of goods. Therefore, the sandboats that cannot load dried fish are only allowed to return to Shanghai empty, with no other means of compensation. However, the round trip takes at least two months. The cost of food and labor during these two months (each boat has at least twenty crew members, including helmsmen, sailors, and cooks, and large boats have thirty or more) results in a loss of about five or six hundred yuan per boat. The total loss is considerable. Due to the dispute over unequal distribution, the transportation of dried fish has been delayed. The goods are expected to arrive in about two weeks.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Actively Prevents Epidemics: Public Water Faucets Installed in Zhabei Providing 4 Million Gallons of Water Daily Free of Charge for the Poor</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, recognizing the potential for the spread of infectious diseases due to the hot weather, is actively taking preventative measures to protect the health of citizens. In addition to vigorously administering vaccinations, they are also installing public water faucets in various parts of Zhabei for the use of the poor. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Vaccinations Exceed One Million: According to a representative of the Municipal Health Bureau, over one million vaccinations have been administered in the Chinese and foreign-controlled areas. The Municipal Health Bureau has administered about half of these vaccinations. Based on the current situation, it is expected that there will be no severe cholera epidemic in Shanghai this summer.</p>
<p>Public Water Faucets Added in Zhabei: Furthermore, the bureau is aware that many poor people in the Zhabei area live in low, crude shacks, where mosquitoes and flies breed easily, increasing the risk of disease. The water they drink is often unclean river or well water, which further facilitates the spread of cholera. Therefore, to protect the health of the poor, in addition to sending personnel to administer vaccinations, they are installing public water faucets in areas with dense shacks for the use of the poor. It is estimated that four million gallons of water are provided daily, all free of charge.</p>

<h3>Removing Yellow Dragons from Mailboxes: Rumors of Active Traitors Should Be Resolved to Dispel Misunderstandings</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the Shanghai Postal Administration received Order No. 2931 from the Ministry of Communications yesterday morning, stating, "The Executive Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters reported that traitors are active in Jiangbei, and mailboxes are painted with yellow dragons.

<h3>Latest American Coffins Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The new alloy seamless coffins from the New York Coffin Company in the United States are manufactured from a mixture of mineral iron and chemical raw materials. The research and creation of these coffins by a number of chemists took decades to complete. The coffins are seamless at every point, and the lid is sealed with a chemical adhesive. Neither moisture in the soil nor water can penetrate the coffin. Even if the coffin is placed in a fire or the ocean, it will remain intact after being retrieved. In 1854, in Covington, Kentucky, USA, a two-year-old infant died. The parents, deeply saddened by the loss, used this type of coffin. After seventy-two years (in 1926), the coffin was re-examined. Not only was the coffin as good as new, but the body was also the same color as it had been in life, with no difference whatsoever. The lining of the coffin is made of white silk woven into a padded mattress. The material is strong and beautifully decorated. After the body is placed inside, it fits snugly everywhere and is not affected by turbulence. The new and novel style of the coffin is even more noteworthy. The high-quality coffins used in China are mostly made of dark Shen, ancient cypress, or Nan wood. However, no matter how strong the wood, it is never immune to moisture and water in the ground. Only this type of coffin can truly be called a lasting resting place and a rare treasure. Several of these coffins have now arrived in Shanghai. The company also hopes that Chinese people will adopt these coffins. If there is any dissatisfaction with the appearance, style, paint color, or interior design, the company can customize the coffins according to submitted drawings. The Chinese people place great emphasis on the bodies of the deceased, especially children who deeply value their parents and have thoughts of cherishing the memory of ancestors. This type of coffin is truly a great contribution to funeral practices. Those wishing to see these coffins should contact Mr. Wang Junfei of Shenchang Foreign Firm on Yuanmingyuan Road in Shanghai.</p>

He immediately led detectives Zhang Ziying and Qian Yumin, along with deputy detective Zhou Buguang and assistant detective Zhang Dongcheng, to search the premises without alarming anyone. In the garret, they confiscated 480,000 red pills, worth tens of thousands of gold pieces, which were divided into 48 flannel bags, each with a rubber bag inside (to prevent water damage) and a "Golden Dragon Brand" label. A trafficker from Hubei named Wang Kunshan, also known as Wang Kunshan (54 years old), was arrested and taken to the police station. At noon that day, the police transferred the suspect and the seized goods to the Second Special District Local Court. Criminal Court Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the first court session.

He requested a postponement of seven days to detain the defendant temporarily and investigate the details of the case, arrest the accomplices, and prosecute them. Detective Zhou Buguang then reported the details of the arrest and the search. The court reviewed the report and briefly questioned the defendant. The judge ordered a postponement until the 19th for further questioning. The defendant was returned to custody. It is said that the drugs were intended for sale in Hunan and Hubei provinces.

Therefore, the Shanghai General Association commissioned Yichen and other fifteen people to rectify the situation. The Zhabei District meeting has convened nine committee meetings, but so far registration has not been enthusiastic, because many branch committees suspect that this committee wants to collect rectification fees. In fact, this committee is serving the citizens, and all expenses are advanced by the rectification members themselves. There are also other organizations outside, but this kind of voluntary work should not be a competition to buy, snatch and grab, the situation is like this, I fear it will hinder the rent reduction, for this reason, all the registered branch committees have been invited to the meeting to hold a joint meeting to jointly plan good strategies to seek welfare for the future of rent reduction. The representatives of the various branch committees are all enthusiastic public welfare people, and today they have this opportunity to gather together, which is very fortunate. Please express your insightful opinions.

<h3>Medical News</h3>
<p>Crowded Free Treatment for Injuries. Mr. Xu's residence at 42 Hengchang Lane, south end of Father Labour Road, Beile Road, French Concession, has a unique family secret for treating injuries from falls and blows. Those who go for treatment are cured almost instantly. The Wanying Wound Medicine he makes is an especially effective remedy for injuries. Since last year, he has been charging 20 cents per dose for the cost of the medicine. A minimum purchase of five doses is required. This summer, Xu Weijun is personally providing diagnoses and instructions on how to treat the root cause of the ailment. Recently, there have been endless requests for treatment. More than twenty households, such as the Zhang residence in Dinghui Lane on Xiaoshadu Road, Yu Xunmin from the He Kang Pawnshop at 29 Ou Jia Road, and Xu Hongshu from the Da Zhongguo Clothing Company at Xiaoximen, have also sent letters to the residence requesting summer dysentery medicine to be forwarded. As a result, the residence is overwhelmed and unable to cope. It has been decided that only one dose of medicine will be given for both in-person and written requests. For those who want to have it made for them, Zhili Pills for stopping diarrhea and Zhisha Pills for treating heatstroke will cost five yuan each per hundred doses, and Wanling Turbidity Powder will cost ten yuan per hundred doses. Each household is limited to one thousand doses. No requests will be honored beyond the limit, regardless of whether they are friends or relatives.</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Lianzhou is Good at Treating Heatstroke. The weather has been very hot recently, and many people have been suffering from heatstroke. The onset can be quite sudden, with initial symptoms such as aversion to cold and chills, followed by fever. Dr. Wu Lianzhou, a long-time doctor for this newspaper, has a great deal of experience with this illness. For example, a friend of Mr. Song Yetang of the general affairs department of this publication, Mr. Shen, had a fever of 105 degrees for ten days, and he was delirious and breaking out in rashes, in a precarious state. Dr. Wu treated him with a large dose of clearing heat and cooling the blood, and he recovered. Also, the Li family, a customs broker in Qipan Street, had four young children who were infected with measles at the same time, all with extreme fever and the rash unable to break through. Other doctors used warm and hot medicines to promote circulation, but Dr. Wu prescribed cold and cooling medicines to directly clear the internal heat, allowing the rash to break through and the fever to subside. According to Dr. Wu, this year's heat is very intense, and for those suffering from damp-warmth, typhoid fever, summer-warmth, and measles, it is essential not to use too many surface-releasing warm-drying medicines, because summer dampness is good at transforming into heat. Dr. Wu's daily clinic is open from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM at 43 Baokang Lane, Xiafei Road, next door to this publication to the west, and from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM.</p>

<p>Reading and Answers</p>
<h3>The Practical Utility of Science —Answer to Mr. Yan Pu—</h3>
<p>Mr. Yan Pu has doubts about the practical utility of studying social science. He believes that we are studying now in the same way as in the late Qing Dynasty, in order to solve the problem of life. However, studying social science cannot solve the problem of life for us. Why should we study it? Also, books are very difficult to buy, so it is not easy to learn even if we want to. We feel that this doubt is not unique to Mr. Yan Pu, and many people will feel it.</p>
<p>First of all, we must say that it is a big mistake for Mr. Yan Pu to regard social science as the same thing as studying in the late Qing Dynasty. Studying in the late Qing Dynasty was to learn a method of praising virtues. What society is like, what the world is like, scholars did not care about. Of course, in the eyes of many scholars, personal life could not only be solved, but would also be very good. However, as far as the entire Chinese society is concerned, the people became more and more foolish and incompetent day by day, and they did not know how to resist the aggression of the great powers. China was turned into a semi-colony, society collapsed, the economy went bankrupt, and the vast majority of people had no way out. This was the result of the scholars at that time blinding themselves and blindly going on the road to promotion and fortune. Now it is different. The reason why we want to study social science is to make our eyes clear, so that we can clearly understand this complex world. Not only to make us personally understand, but also to make the masses open their eyes. The popular mass language movement recently is ultimately aimed at enabling the masses to approach science and understand the world (to be continued)</p>
<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, In the "Letters to the Editor" column of your newspaper's local news on July 9, there was a letter from lawyer Wen Ren'an regarding the case of the Yuxing ship colliding with Shao Genggen's civilian ship. There are many misunderstandings regarding the resolution of the case. It has been found that the shipowner Shao Genggen himself and the Zhaoxing Company have repeatedly petitioned the Navigation Administration Bureau to uphold justice. The Bureau has entrusted it to this Committee for handling. As it is the responsibility of this Committee, although the case has been prosecuted, in order to determine the responsibility for the negligence and to establish a mediation, the Committee convened both parties and witnesses for inquiries and handling at the 12th meeting (May 28) and the 13th meeting (June 11). At the 13th meeting (June 11), because the detailed account of losses submitted by Shao Genggen himself on June 10 was reviewed, the shipowner was repeatedly inquired, and the recorded confession was explained to him repeatedly in accordance with the Committee's usual procedures. After he fully understood it, the shipowner signed it and attached it to the file. Lawyer Wen declared that the signature was invalid in the newspaper because he did not know the contents of the shipowner's confession and the Committee's handling procedures. The contents of the announcement are completely inconsistent with the facts. The lawyer was instructed in letters on June 19 and 13 to publish a correction in the newspaper. The facts and circumstances of the Shao case were thoroughly investigated at the 12th meeting (May 28) and the 13th meeting (June 11). At the 15th meeting (July 6), in order to be thorough, the captain of the Yuxing ship and the deputy of the Longmao small ship were questioned again. The resolution was completely based on the reports of the Customs and various parties, and the judgment was made by experts. The reasons are detailed in the Committee's judgment. The lawyer has not seen it and insists that "the standards for the Committee's resolutions are based on the situation described unilaterally by one or two people," which can be said to be arbitrary. The phrase "obviously decided with prejudice" is particularly slanderous. Since its establishment, the Committee has handled many cases of civilian ships being hit. The causes of the accidents are often: (1) Civilian ships are not familiar with the rules for avoiding collisions; (2) Because they believe that overtaking ships is a good omen, they often cross ships regardless of danger. Therefore, according to the facts, the responsibility for negligence is not entirely attributable to the person who hit the ship. There are many previous examples that can be reviewed. In short, the content of the Shao Genggen case is complicated. The lawyer said in his letter that he has petitioned the court for a thorough investigation. If this is true, when personnel are sent to investigate in the future, it will not be difficult to determine right and wrong. The details of the case are described in detail above, and I respectfully ask that this letter be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column as a correction. Sincerely, The Shipping Collision Dispute Resolution Committee of the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, July 10, to the Editorial Department of Local News, Shen Bao Newspaper.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I was very surprised to read the article "Dispute over Shutdown of Yixin Toothbrush Factory" in the news column of your newspaper. The points that should be corrected are listed below: (1) Mr. Dai Zhixie is a representative of the shareholders. He came to reorganize the company and did not hold the position of manager. (2) The factory's work stoppage was purely in accordance with the agreement reached between labor and management. The case is documented. The workers disregarded party and government agencies and despised the agreement between the two parties, resulting in the unauthorized opening of the motor and automatic strike. (3) The workers' illegal automatic strike has been investigated by party and government agencies and the General Labor Union, and they have been advised to resume work first and then formally mediate. The workers have refused to comply. The facts are all there. The factory has always acted in accordance with the orders of party and government agencies. What has closed the factory, changed the attitude? It seems that right and wrong have been reversed, and black and white have been confused. I respectfully request that your newspaper grant a correction to clarify the facts. This is to the Shen Bao Newspaper Editorial Department. Sincerely, Yixin Toothbrush Company, July 9, 1934.</p>

<h3>New Techniques of Tennis (1) Originally Written by J. PARMLY PARET, Jointly Translated by Qian Yiqin and Hong Jun —Copyright Reserved, Reproduction Prohibited—</h3>
<p>The original name of this book is "How to Play Lawn Tennis," written by J. Parmly Paret, a famous American tennis player. Mr. Paret has won the All-American Singles and Indoor Tennis Championships and has written extensively. His most notable works include "Tennis Primer," "Tennis Mechanics," "Advanced Tennis Techniques and Psychology," "Methods and Balls," etc. The book published last year is particularly valued by tennis experts from various countries and is regarded as the only great work in the modern tennis world. Whether it is the comprehensiveness of its content, the precision of its insights, or the clarity of its theory, both tennis beginners and experts can benefit greatly. It is now specially translated by Qian Yiqin and Hong Jun, under the guidance of the Shanghai YMCA Sports Department, for research by those who love this sport. The translation is clear and fluent, and all the true meanings have not been lost.</p>
<h3>Chapter 1: The Importance of Grip</h3>
<p>The various methods adopted by tennis players are rooted in good posture and contain fixed principles.</p>
<p>Success in tennis technique doesn't come easy; there are few shortcuts. If you seek excellence, you must put in the same hard work as other dedicated male and female players to achieve it.</p>
<p>Beginners often overlook small details, considering them insignificant. However, the foundation of tennis skill is based on these elements. Those new to the game think any grip is the same. If they accidentally use a grip that returns a ball successfully, even if it hits the net, this success makes them believe they have chosen correctly, which is a big mistake.</p>
<p>While any grip might occasionally succeed, choosing the best grip will result in more effective hits and fewer errors. Therefore, the several fixed grips developed through long experience have produced successful shots in the hands of most players.</p>
<p>When hitting the ball, the use of the racket must be absolutely free. The bounce of the ball is hard to predict, so when facing an unexpected bounce, one should not feel hindered by one's position. Such difficulty is unavoidable even for tennis masters, though they can accurately predict the ball's flight path, curve, or bounce. Yet they are often caught in awkward positions when hitting incoming balls.</p>
<p>When a ball bounces closer to the body than expected, the arm will naturally draw in to cope with this difficulty. However, the angle of the racket face will naturally change, and there is no time to change the grip. Thus, the pre-selected grip must be easily adaptable to unpredictable incoming balls.</p>
<p>Players of different schools still use different grips, mainly because players practiced their skills in different situations. In England, where the game originated, most courts are grass. The bounce of the ball on grass is much lower than on hard courts in other countries.</p>
<p>Therefore, the standard English grip requires the player to lower the racket to below the ball and hit the low-bouncing ball over the net. Thus, the English grip is slightly in front of the racket, with the racket face angled backward, hitting the ball from underneath to elevate its trajectory.</p>
<p>American courts are on hard surfaces, where the ball bounces higher. Therefore, the grip is different. On the Pacific coast, courts were formerly paved with cinders, leading to a more extreme grip change. The so-called "Western" grip is used to cope with the very high ball bounce from extremely hard courts. Californians move their hand backward and down the handle to hit these high-bouncing balls.</p>
<p>If a player adopts either of these two absolutely different grips—English or Western—they will face difficulties when playing on a court where that grip is unsuitable. Therefore, it is best to adopt a compromise, so that difficulties aren't felt in any situation. These "Eastern" grips produce less erratic and more stable results than other special grips. One point to pay special attention to when learning tennis is that the methods used by any successful tennis player, even a champion, are not necessarily the best. Some players succeed even by using the most unstable methods, overcoming their shortcomings. However, the same method may not produce the same effect in the hands of ordinary players, or even be completely different. Therefore, experience gained from years of research and championships tells us that a skill adopted by most players of different builds, temperaments, and strengths is the most stable tennis skill. Beginners must not idolize; do not be impressed by Tilden's most magical shots when running, Mlle Lenglen's shots with both feet off the ground, or Richard's effective shots from difficult positions. Beginners will not have the same chance to produce the same effect even if they try to emulate them a hundred times. If you adopt a stable method, you are more likely to achieve better results eight or nine times out of ten. This is obvious. If Tilden had time to stop before his magical shots, he would have fewer missed shots. If Mlle Lenglen could hit the ball with her feet on the ground, her shots would be more effective. If Richard could improve his usual hitting style and hit the ball from the right position, his tennis skills would be even better than they are today.</p>

The Chinese Association also has three matches against the Southern Grass Association, the Northern Grass Association, and the Internal Mills.

<h3>Swimming Association Open Swimming Competition</h3>
<p>On the 15th evening at Lan Garden</p>
<p>The Chinese Swimming Research Association, which holds open swimming competitions every year, is scheduled to hold one at 8:30 PM on the 15th evening at the International Swimming Pool on Avenue Meyers, French Concession. Winners will be organized into a strong team, to practice free of charge, so that they can compete with groups from all countries in Shanghai, in order to promote swimming technology. We hope that healthy people in the country will participate as soon as possible. The registration place is the association at 115 Hankou Road, telephone 13734. The registration fee is two jiao in silver. The competition items are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) 60-yard freestyle, (2) 120-yard backstroke, (3) 120-yard freestyle, (4) 210-yard breaststroke, (5) 840-yard freestyle, (6) 90-yard three-style swim (30 yards freestyle, 30 yards breaststroke, 30 yards backstroke), (7) fancy diving (each person can participate in three items)</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Swimming Pool To Begin Construction Immediately</h3>
<p>Can be Completed in Forty Days and Used During the Summer Holidays</p>
<p>The construction of the swimming pool for Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School has been put out to tender and the bid has been revealed. It will be undertaken by the Sen Kee Construction Company, which previously built the swimming pool for Cheng Yize's mansion, and will begin construction immediately. The entire project is limited to forty days, and it will be ready for use by the middle of next month. It is heard that the pool was designed by Mr. Gu Pengcheng, an engineer from the Zhongdu Engineering Office. Mr. Gu is also the designer of the National Tongji University swimming pool. The pool is 25 meters long and 10 meters wide, which is the standard competition size. The pool body is completely decorated with white magnetic tiles, which are clean and solid. It is not only a first for a domestic women's school, but also a giant in Shanghai swimming pools. In the future, after the project is completed, it is also planned to allocate a part of the time to the public, and all major middle schools in the Jiangwan area can use it.</p>
<h3>Summer Sports Training Class</h3>
<p>Registration is Very Enthusiastic</p>
<p>The summer sports training class co-organized by the Sports Class Alumni Association of the Ministry of Education and the Chinese Athletic Association has been very popular since it started enrolling students. The reason is that the association attaches equal importance to both academic and practical subjects, and the teaching materials are novel. In addition to the association's president, Chu Minyi, personally leading the teaching, contemporary sports celebrities are also invited to take on courses. The list of professors will be announced soon. In order to facilitate students from this port and other ports, those who want to register or request a copy of the regulations can contact the Chinese Athletic Association at 90 Dongxinqiao Street, Shanghai, or the Diligence Bookstore at 392 Rue Labourdonnais, Shanghai, from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM every day. All students who have already registered can move to the Zhengfeng Middle School in Xujiahui from the 18th to stay. Registration will close on the 19th, and classes will start on the 20th. However, those who come from afar can register at any time.</p>
<h3>Lingnan Protests to the Shanghai West Football Association</h3>
<p>Because a Lingnan Player Was Ejected in Eight Minutes</p>
<p>On the 7th of this month, the Lingnan football team and the Customs A team played a championship game at the Shanghai West stadium in Caojiadu. Because the competition was a final, the actions of both players were inevitably close to being malicious. Eight minutes after the start of the game, Tang Naiqiang, the left winger of Lingnan, was suddenly ordered to leave the field by the referee for a minor reason, resulting in Lingnan losing 1-0. Afterwards, Lingnan believed that the referee's action was obviously a violation of the rules and had the disadvantage of giving the other party an advantage. Therefore, the sports group of the association sent a letter to the Shanghai West Committee to formally protest and temporarily put forward four reasons, so that the Shanghai West Committee can make a fair judgment based on reason.</p>
<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains the Education Association Law</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously received a report from the Nanjing Municipal Social Bureau regarding Article 20 of Chapter 4 of the Education Association Law, which stipulates that each district education association shall have three to five secretaries and two alternate secretaries, who shall be elected by the members' congress. However, Article 22 of the same law stipulates that provincial education associations and municipal education associations directly under the Executive Yuan shall have seven to eleven directors. The members of provincial education associations are county and city education associations, while the number of secretaries of county and city education associations is five to seven. The position of the district education association under the jurisdiction of the municipal education association directly under the central government seems to be equal to that of the county and city education associations. Please give an explanation as soon as possible as to whether the number of secretaries of the district education association in this city can be elected to five to seven. The bureau was instructed as follows: It is found that the provision of three to five secretaries in the Education Association Law is originally for the purpose of leaving room for flexibility. The district education association in the city should follow the method and shall not increase the number of secretaries in accordance with the county and city education associations. You should be informed immediately.</p>

<h3>Students Approved by the Ministry of Education to Study Abroad Must Leave the Country Within Three Months</h3>
<p>Certificates Were Received Yesterday, and Minister Wang Gave Instructions</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 10th Dispatch) The Ministry of Education took 26 students from the four provinces of Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi who passed the re-examination and selected them to study abroad. All the students received their certificates of eligibility on the 10th. Wang Shijie specially summoned a tea party at 5 PM on the 10th and gave instructions to the admitted students, ordering them to return to their hometowns within the day to complete the formalities and leave the country within three months.</p>
<h3>Jiayin Increases Primary School Teachers' Salaries</h3>
<p>A Total Increase of 1,452 Yuan Per Year</p>
<p>Jiayin Communication, Director of Education Xiong Zhu Gao for the problem of elementary school teachers' salaries in Mu County, before the sorting out, were determined by the schools themselves, and were uneven and without standards. Since the educational supervisor’s special inspection, thorough sorting out, and the promulgation of elementary school teachers' salary standards, teachers' salaries have been based on qualifications, and there have been no difficulties in implementing them for half a year. However, according to the standards, graduates of the old-style normal undergraduate and senior high school normal departments, who serve as principals of complete elementary schools of the sixth grade, have a monthly salary of only 26 yuan, and those who serve as teachers of the senior primary grade have a monthly salary of only 22 yuan, and other qualifications must be lowered. Compared with neighboring counties such as Xi Chang, the difference is still huge. The work is complicated and the responsibility is heavy, and it is really difficult to blame them for being loyal to their duties. As a result, excellent people are forced to develop abroad for a while, and cunning people are lazy in their duties and wait for opportunities to stir up trouble. The actual major question is not solved, not only is education difficult to stabilize, and it is not easy to attract talent. It is proposed to appropriately increase the salaries of elementary school principals and senior teachers within the scope of possible financial resources. According to the standards promulgated by the Ting, the principals of single-grade schools are promoted by one grade and two yuan, the principals of three-grade schools are promoted by two grades, and the principals of six-grade schools are promoted by three grades. It is now proposed that the principals of single-grade schools remain the same, and after one grade is added, one yuan is added, that is, the principals of the second grade will be increased by three yuan, and the principals of the third grade will be increased by four yuan, and so on. Primary school teachers will be promoted by one grade according to the standards promulgated by the Ting. It is now proposed that grade teachers will be promoted by two grades, and subject teachers will still be promoted by one grade. If a senior high school normal school graduate serves as the principal of a sixth-grade complete primary school and also serves as a senior grade teacher, he can receive a salary of 31 yuan (including a base salary of 20 yuan, a promotion of 7 yuan for six grades, and a promotion of 4 yuan for serving as a teacher for two grades, for a total of 31 yuan). Teachers can receive a salary of 24 yuan. According to the statistics of the current teacher list, the total annual increase in expenditure is 1,452 yuan. The current budget is listed according to the highest qualifications, so there is no risk of exceeding it. In order to slightly stabilize the lives of teachers and improve educational efficiency, this method is unavoidable. It has been submitted to the Education Department for inspection and approval yesterday, and instructions have been given to comply with it.</p>
<h3>Anhui University Suspends the Law School</h3>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government once ordered the provincial Anhui University to suspend the law school and add an agricultural college and merge departments. After receiving the order, Anhui University discussed it in detail and has now replied to the Provincial Government that the law department will be suspended immediately, and the first-year students who have not graduated will be ordered to transfer to other departments separately. The second and third-year grades will be sent to domestic universities to borrow books, following the example of the suspension of the biology department in previous years. The two departments of political economy will be merged into the department of political economy and transferred to the liberal arts college. The law school will be cancelled, and detailed plans will be drawn up for the addition of an agricultural college. Although the number of students in the two departments of physics and mathematics is relatively small, they will not be merged at this time of promoting the expansion of science. After receiving the report, the Provincial Government has transferred it to the Ministry of Education for filing.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Held a Joint Graduation Ceremony for People's Supplementary Schools Yesterday</h3>
<p>Municipal Education Bureau Director Pan Attended and Gave Instructions</p>

<p>Ceremony Situation The participants included Municipal Education Bureau Director Pan, Section Chief Jiang, Municipal Government Representative Zhang Yuanruo, and all the graduates of the municipal area of the People's and Supplementary Schools, and representatives of the rural area graduates, totaling approximately 500 people. Chairman Jiang Jianbai conducted the ceremony as usual.

Shao Wenxian, the representative of the People's School graduates, and Zhang Shifan, the representative of the Supplementary School graduates, gave speeches in reply. Then, the Municipal Education Bureau distributed souvenirs and the meeting was dismissed after taking pictures.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report Chairman Jiang Jianbai reported the general situation of the People's and Supplementary Schools as follows: (1) General situation of the People's Schools Number of schools, 2 experimental people's schools, 48 ordinary people's schools, grades 7 experimental people's schools, 49 ordinary people's schools, number of funds, 256 yuan per month for experimental people's schools, totaling 1,536 yuan for six months, 882 yuan per month for ordinary people's schools, totaling 4,410 yuan for five months, a total of 5,946 yuan for this session, number of students, 1,106 boys, 1,148 girls, totaling 2,254 people, approximately 1,500 male and female graduates, the amount of funding per graduate is approximately 3 yuan and 8 jiao, starting from the 12th session of the 23rd year, senior classes will be added to the People's Schools.

In the future, all graduates of the senior classes of the People's Schools can still enter vocational supplementary schools.</p>
<p>Summary of Instructions (1) Municipal Government Representative Zhang Yuanruo gave instructions, briefly stating that the purpose of the Municipal Education Bureau in running the People's Schools and Supplementary Schools is to hope that everyone will become a loving national after entering school. Everyone must be a good national. First, you must have order and abide by discipline. Second, you must love the country. Third, you must love domestic goods. Fourth, you must continue to make progress. Fifth, you must have good morals and be able to understand propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame. (2) Municipal Education Bureau Director Pan gave instructions, briefly stating that graduation from the People's School is only a preliminary step. Now the Education Bureau is going to run senior classes. I hope that graduates will sign up to participate and seek progress. Take time out every day to read books. Graduation from the senior class is of course a further step than it is now. Even if you don't go to school, you can read books and newspapers by yourself. This is what I hope for the People's School students. Secondly, vocational supplementary schools, there are of course many unemployed adults in the society now. We hope to run more vocational supplementary schools in the future, so that in addition to seeking knowledge, you can also acquire vocational skills. The more graduates of this kind, the healthier the society can become. Furthermore, regardless of whether you are graduates of the People's School or the Supplementary School, you should understand that we study and seek skills, the key is not just to know some characters and learn the skills of life, but to let us understand how to be a person. The principles of being a person can be seen in books and newspapers, and you cannot understand them if you are illiterate. We must maintain our lives, so we must have life skills to seek the supply of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. All of these are for the purpose of being a person. You cannot be a person just by relying on reading and having skills. Your reading and literacy are just getting a key to the door of the principles of being a person. You must be able to use this key to open this door, so that you can know the principles of being a person. There are many principles of being a person. Now let's take a few small things as an example. For example, in the summer, people must know how to prevent epidemics, pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene, etc. At the same time as reading and literacy, you must do what the words mean. Graduation from this supplementary school is only the beginning of doing it, not the end of doing it. I hope that you will seek the principles of being a person everywhere.</p>
<h3>Director Pan of the Education Bureau Talks About the Actual Situation of the Issuance of Municipal Education Bonds</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Meeting Resolved to Stop Issuing It Is Not True</p>
<p>If Approval Is Obtained for Issuance, It Should Be Collected and Paid by the Finance Bureau</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Shanghai Times News reported yesterday that Secretary Zhang of the Municipal Government said, "The issuance of municipal education bonds has been stopped." In order to clarify the truth, the reporter of the Shanghai News Agency specially visited Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau to inquire about everything. Director Pan first believed that the suspension of the issuance of bonds was not true, and then issued the following statement: In view of the fact that the school buildings of the municipal schools in this city are mostly simple and crude, or rent private houses, or fake ancestral halls and temples, and are old houses for many years, which are not only not applicable but also dangerous, the bureau has long wanted to plan in a comprehensive way, and submitted a request to the Municipal Government to allocate reliable taxes to issue 1 million yuan of education construction bonds in order to sort out and once received an order from the Municipal Government to consult with the Finance Bureau to designate which tax as a guarantee and what is the appropriate total amount to be issued, and jointly formulate a concrete plan for adoption and implementation. The municipal government meeting did not include the agenda for discussion this time, so the so-called resolution to stop the issuance is not true. Moreover, education is one of the important municipal affairs in this city. The right to issue bonds for the construction of municipal affairs is in the hands of the Municipal Government, and the bureau is only in an advisory position. If approval is obtained for issuance in the future, it should be collected and paid by the Finance Bureau in accordance with the purpose of unified collection and payment of municipal finance. The report said that "each is doing its own thing, and the system is in chaos," or it is a false statement, which is not entirely true.</p>
<h3>The China Science Society Is Actively Preparing for the 19th Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>The Venue Has Been Found at the Lushan Lian Gu Youth Association</p>
<p>Railway and Other Departments Will Give Special Discounts to Members</p>
<p>Three University Societies Will Jointly Participate in This Year's Annual Meeting</p>
<p>The 19th annual meeting of the China Science Society has been scheduled to be held in Lushan, Nanchang, starting on August 21. The venue has been found at the Lian Gu Youth Association. Railway and other departments will give special discounts to members for traveling to and from the meeting. During the annual meeting, the Chinese Botanical Society and other three groups will jointly participate. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Nanchang Preparatory Committee Finds the Venue</h3>
<p>Under the leadership of Director Cheng Bolu of the Jiangxi Education Department and Mr. Xiao Shugang, the preparations for this year's annual meeting have been almost completed. The most difficult thing to prepare for this year is to choose the venue, because recently Lushan has been crowded with tourists and there is a lack of housing. The Nanchang Preparatory Committee is very interested in the Lian Gu Youth Association because of its spacious location and beautiful scenery, which is most suitable for holding meetings. It has been rented by the Shanghai General Office and the Shanghai Youth Association, including two large dormitories, one office building, one large auditorium, and one large dining hall. Other facilities such as tennis courts and swimming pools can accommodate hundreds of people.</p>
<h3>Railway and Other Departments Give Discounts to Members</h3>
<p>Members traveling to and from the annual meeting will receive a 20% discount on shipping fares on Fujian, Guangdong, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yangtze River ships, which has been negotiated with the Ministry of Communications and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Members from various ports in Sichuan Province will receive a 50% discount on fares on Minsheng Company ships. The railway will still follow the usual practice of a 25% discount on one-way tickets and a 50% discount on return tickets, which has been submitted to the Ministry of Education for transfer to the Ministry of Railways for verification and reduction of ticket prices.</p>
<h3>Participation of Three Major Academic Societies in the Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>The most distinctive feature of this year's annual meeting of the society is the joint participation of the Chinese Botanical Society, the Chinese Geographical Society, and the Chinese Zoological Society. Therefore, the program for this year's annual meeting will be different from previous years. In addition to the general discussion sessions, members of the society's biology and geography sections will also hold joint discussion sessions with the three academic societies. This will create a very strong academic atmosphere. After the meeting, the participants will jointly go to Nanchang, the New Life Center, or other places for inspection.</p>
<h3>Solicitation of Lecturers by the Lecture Committee</h3>
<p>The Lecture Committee of the Society's Annual Meeting has decided to divide the lectures into two groups: secondary school science education and production construction. The former is intended for secondary school teachers, and the latter is intended for politicians and the general public. Most of the lectures will be held in Nanchang. The committee is currently actively soliciting members to serve as lecturers for each subject. Once the arrangements are finalized, they will be announced in advance.</p>
<h3>Invitation from the Guangxi Provincial Government to Hold a Meeting</h3>
<p>The Guangxi Provincial Government recently sent a special telegram to the Society, welcoming the next annual meeting to be held in Guilin. The telegram reads as follows: "To the Science Society of China, Albert Road, Shanghai: We have received a telegram from President Ma of Guangxi University, informing us that your esteemed society does not disdain our remote location and is willing to hold its annual meeting at Guangxi University next year. The scientific community in our province sincerely welcomes you and is extremely pleased. We hereby send this special telegram to express our welcome. Please acknowledge receipt. Guangxi Provincial Government (stamped)." It is reported that next year will be the Society's 20th anniversary, and it seems very appropriate to hold the meeting in the beautiful province of Guilin. This proposal will be submitted to this year's annual meeting for discussion.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Siam Establish a Public Library</h3>
<p>A letter to the Shanghai Publishing Industry</p>
<p>Soliciting Books and Publications</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Siam feel that libraries are a cause for generations, but there is a lack of well-established Chinese libraries in Bangkok to enlighten the minds of young overseas Chinese and make them understand the concept of supporting their motherland. This is often regarded as a regret. Recently, the Peiying School, sponsored by overseas Chinese, initiated the establishment of the Bangkok Overseas Chinese Public Library. The library is temporarily located in the school. It has now sent letters to the publishing industry in Shanghai, soliciting various books, magazines, and publications.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shen Departs for England to Study</h3>
<p>Zhang Shen, styled Minquan, is a native of Lin'an, Zhejiang. He graduated from the Department of Education of National Southeast University. He has served as a chief supervisor and staff member of the Nanjing and Shanghai Education Bureaus for many years. It is now learned that Mr. Zhang is going to study in England at his own expense for further education. He will enter the University of London to specialize in education for a period of two years. Mr. Zhang set sail yesterday on the Lapland, a ship of the British Steamship Company. Relatives and friends flocked to the New Customs Wharf to see him off.</p>
<h3>A Good Opportunity to Study Chinese Classics</h3>
<p>Liu Liansheng, a widely learned scholar, has often founded primary and secondary schools and normal schools. He has also served as a professor at major primary and secondary schools in Hunan and Shanghai. He has thousands of students scattered in all directions. He has traveled abroad to study education. After the May Thirtieth Incident, he retired due to old age and a desire for leisure. His method of teaching Chinese is different from others, achieving twice the result with half the effort, purely based on experience. Now, his outstanding students, Mr. He Xianqi and Mr. Hou Changguo, both giants in the education field, have founded a university summer vacation and weekend tutoring class to promote Chinese classics. They have earnestly requested Mr. Liu to serve as a lecturer. It is reported that he has agreed. The lectures will begin this Sunday at 8:00 AM and end at 10:00 AM at the China Vocational Education Society on Hualong Road. It is reported that registration is enthusiastic and the quota is almost full, but more people are coming every day. This is because it is difficult to find a good teacher to guide the study of Chinese, so people are eager to seize this opportunity.</p>
<h3>Extension of Registration for the Summer School of the Art Academy - Student Dormitories Leased -</h3>
<p>The summer school affiliated with the West Lake National Art Academy is scheduled to begin classes on the 9th of this month. It is reported that students from various provinces have been requesting an extension of the registration period, with several requests every day. It is also learned that the school authorities, in consideration of the students from remote areas who love art, have decided to extend the registration period for one week, but the start date of the classes will not be changed. It is also learned that the school has contacted Qiushi, Taoshe, Huchunlou, Guanghua Temple, etc., to rent dormitories for male and female students.</p>
<h3>Lisheng Primary School Holds an Exhibition of Achievements</h3>
<p>Lisheng Primary School, located at 201 Sapo Sai Road, Ximen Road, French Concession, yesterday displayed the outstanding achievements of the students in the past semester for viewing and invited the parents of the students. The achievements were displayed in two classrooms in a thorough, detailed, and exceptionally satisfactory manner. In addition to the school board members Wu Yaosun, Zhou Han, Dong Jiji, and Sun Wai, more than 500 guests attended.

<h3>The Foundation of "Thoroughness"</h3>
<p>— Gong Han</p>
<p>Nowadays, if you say that a person's argument is "superb," you may provoke some resistance from the critics, but if you say it is "thorough" or "very progressive," it seems that there is still nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p>It is now the time when "thorough" and "very progressive" arguments have replaced "superb" ones.</p>
<p>Literature and art originally have a limit to their target audience. For example, literature originally targets readers who understand words. The degree to which people understand words varies, so the writing must have different levels of depth. It is natural for writers to advocate using ordinary words and writing clearly. But at this time, the "thorough" theorist comes out and says that there are many illiterate people in China. What are you going to do about it? This is really a blow to the head of writers, who can only suffocate to death to show him.</p>
<p>However, you can ask for help from another branch, that is, to defend yourself. Because illiterate people are already outside the scope of literary effect, at this time, you have to ask painters, playwrights, and filmmakers to show him images other than words. However, this is not enough to shut the mouth of the "thorough" theorist, who will say that among the illiterate, there are also color-blind people and blind people. What are you going to do about it? So the artists also took a blow to the head and could only suffocate to death to show him.</p>
<p>So, as a last resort, it is said that for the color-blind and blind, lectures, songs, and storytelling should be used. It is also reasonable to say this. However, he will ask you: Have you forgotten that there are also deaf people in China?</p>
<p>Another blow to the head, suffocation, all suffocated to death.</p>
<p>So the "thorough" theorist comes to a conclusion: All the literature and art of today are useless and must be thoroughly reformed!</p>
<p>After establishing this conclusion, he disappeared. Who will "thoroughly" reform it? That is naturally the artists. However, there are many artists who are not "thorough," so China will never have good, "thorough" literature and art that is effective for the illiterate, color-blind, blind, and deaf.</p>
<p>But the "thorough" theorist will sometimes stick his head out and criticize the artists.</p>
<p>If those who engage in literature and art encounter such a big person and cannot tear off his mask, then literature and art will not only not move forward, but will also shrink and eventually be eliminated by him. Practical artists must recognize the true face of this kind of "thorough" theorist!</p>
<p>A: Someone is living off the sweat of others.</p>
<p>B: Then is he an exploiter?</p>
<p>A: No, he is the owner of a Turkish bath.</p>
<h3>Noon</h3>
<p>— Lin Xi</p>
<p>Watching the sun climb to the zenith,</p>
<p>Carrying accumulated fatigue,</p>
<p>It's time to rest in front of the thatched eaves.</p>
<p>Thinking, thinking about how to spend the autumn,</p>
<p>Entrusting all hope to</p>
<p>The crops lying obediently under the scorching sun.</p>
<p>The poplars are no longer noisy,</p>
<p>Listening to the cuckoo so dully</p>
<p>— Cuckoo, cuckoo.</p>
<p>Listening to the drawn-out "zi" sonorous, monotonous sound, watching the caterpillars on the elm trees hanging down, hanging down,</p>
<p>Even the dry cigarette is inhaled lazily.</p>
<h3>On the Jichang Line</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Speaking of the Jichang Road, one is reminded of the Pingjin Road, because geography tells us that the length of these two roads is equal, both being two hundred and forty li.</p>
<p>Although this road is not long, its business is not bad. The coolies who come from Shandong go to the mountains in southeastern Jilin to reclaim wasteland, or people from the mountains in southeastern Jilin go to the northwest of the province. They must take the train on this road. The Jihai Line should theoretically take away the passengers from Dalian who are transferred to the mountains in the southeast, but because the tracks are often interrupted, everyone hesitates to take it and would rather take the long way. Last year, the Labin Road (from Lafa Station on the Jidun Road to Harbin) was completed. It seems that the Jichang Road will be considerably affected and lose some passengers; people going to Harbin and other places from the mountains in the southeast no longer need to go through Jilin and Changchun.</p>
<p>This Labin Road is a sharp arrow that Japanese imperialism extends from Yanbian into northern Manchuria, and its main point is to control Soviet Russia and facilitate military transportation.</p>
<p>The vehicles on the Jichang Road are the same as those on the South Manchuria Road, but a little older. I heard before that these are all old cars that the South Manchuria Road no longer used and were bought by our Railway Bureau. It doesn't matter if it's old, it's just that the car is not as clean as the South Manchuria car.</p>
<p>Near the Yingchengzi Station, there is a Huoshilingzi coal mine, which was mined by the former Jilin Provincial Government. The coal seam is very thick and the coal quality is also good. Now it is also in the hands of the Japanese. In this coal mine, some workers killed the foreman and joined the Volunteer Army to resist Japan two years ago.</p>
<p>Near Tumuling Station, there is a Tumuling. A tunnel was dug under the ridge, and it takes about three minutes for the train to pass through. This area is mostly mountainous, but there is no good scenery. Tumuling Station is a famous station on the entire line, but not because the station is large. In fact, this is just a small station. The reason for its fame is first because there is a small tunnel, and second because of the meat buns. As soon as the train enters the station, even before it has stopped, some villagers selling buns shout loudly, and passengers are also willing to spend a few dollars on this food, but in fact, there are more old buns than new buns. I don't know how many times the steaming heat has been steamed. Some people also say that the meat filling is some dead pork.</p>
<p>The Songhua River flows past the Jiuzhan Station. There are some wood factories here, and there is also a stone mountain. The wood factories are engaged in the timber business. They unload rafts from the river and transport them to the station to be loaded onto trains and transported elsewhere. As for the stone mountain, it has made a lot of contributions to the construction of the new railway in Northeast China. Every day, some stone-knocking workers live by this stone mountain.</p>
<p>On both sides of the road, sorghum is not allowed to be planted. The stations are also surrounded by barbed wire and stacked with sandbags to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>The money spent on the Jichang train is Jilin silver dollars and Jilin official notes. Only Harbin silver dollars are spent on the Hachang train, and what is spent on the South Manchuria train is gold notes. Although Feng tickets can be used, few people take them out because they have depreciated too much. The lack of unified currency in Northeast China gives passengers great suffering.</p>
<p>Now I hear that Manchuria has completely unified the currency system, which is naturally a good thing, but whose credit is this? Isn't there any other effect in this?</p>
<p>There is an iron bridge over the Yima River, but this is not a big project. The Jichang Road was once interrupted in the summer two years ago because the iron bridge was bombed. I think this is worth mentioning at the end of the article.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Shu Ling</p>
<p>Once, a man asked a horse dealer:</p>
<p>"Friend! What do you think, how should a woman be considered beautiful?"</p>
<p>Logically, it should be long, curved eyebrows, cherry-red lips, long eyelashes, blue eyes like small silver bells, a slender waist, and bound feet; however, heavens! How did this horse dealer answer! He said:</p>
<p>"Best, her feet should be like this." He pointed to a horse's hoof.</p>
<p>This story proves that people of another class will never understand a certain class, whether in spirit or in material. There seems to be an insurmountable high wall between them, dividing them into two worlds.</p>
<p>Tolstoy sympathized with the oppressed class, and in his old age, he left alone, hoping to get rid of the aristocratic taste that he could not get rid of. As a result, he realized that he would not become a revolutionary. (The reason is that he was an aristocrat.) The ending of "boredom" made him escape into religion.</p>
<p>Reading G. L. Dickinson's Modern Forum, there is a poet who says that the value of life always exists in life, and every kind of life has value. Therefore, in the war-torn countryside, it seems that "rural happiness" is everywhere. He said: "Even the things you scold have their value. The bad things you say are very bad; but at the same time they are so good." He further elaborated on this meaning:</p>
<p>"Once, I read a terrible article of that kind—I think that kind of article is always useful—about the living conditions of tenants. After reading it, I rode a horse to the countryside. The actual situation was not as bad as the article said. I am not saying that everything is very good, but it is also surprisingly good. The large horse with fluffy hooves was resting on the green field, the cows were wading across the shallow stream, the willows were brushing the creek, the birds were clinging to the reeds, and there were swans, partridges, and thrushes. There were flowers blooming in the garden, a vast expanse of white, a small garden washed by sunlight, and the shadows of clouds flying over the ground. The tenant farmer who was concerned about the article was working in the beautiful scenery. He didn't look like an incarnation of pain! He was thinking about his own horse or his bread and cheese, or his children calling by the road, or his pigs and chickens. I naturally don't think he understands how beautiful the surrounding scenery is, but I dare say he has a kind of ease. He doesn't worry about his own situation, unlike the worry you feel for him."</p>
<p>This poet also said:</p>
<p>"I often feel as if I love everyone and everything so much that I want to embrace them, because they are so good, willing to live in this glorious world—all the drivers, coachmen, merchants, slum landlords, victims in the slums, prostitutes, thieves, no matter how strange and bizarre their backgrounds are, floating in the ever-flowing, eternal river of life, no matter what country it flows through, this river itself is good and worth existing." After the poet spoke fluently, what should I say? The poet believes that the world is originally good and originally bad, so those who disturb themselves are because many people have lost their "interest in life," so it is best to be content with the status quo, and the "poet" can continue to do so leisurely. This status quo, which the poets think is "so good," is ultimately the effect of "emotional transference." If you open your eyes, this status quo seems to be surprisingly bad.</p>
<p>What if you are not satisfied with the status quo? A group of respectable young people think this is easy, like drawing lots, randomly picking a kind of doctrine, memorizing some high-sounding articles, publishing some novels and poems, and then looking around anxiously, the world is still stinky and messy. One laughs and says: "I am originally a theorist." There are also "practitioners," but most of them rush around in a daze, no different from those who commit suicide. But there are also those who cautiously follow the orders of the "general," and the ending is also difficult to say, and in China, it seems that there is a suspicion of being used. — The so-called "general" has its own historical nature, as far back as Liu Bang in the Qin Dynasty riots, and as recent as Hong Yang in the Qing Dynasty. The people occasionally rise up, and they are taken advantage of by this kind of cunning people.</p>
<p>The demagogues before the revolution may not be able to understand the revolution. After the storm, it will instead make him feel disillusioned, so he will be silent or even rebel. The French poet Baudelaire was very supportive when the Paris Commune first started, but when he saw that the revolution was gradually not the result he had imagined, he began to rebel.</p>
<p>In China, it is not so much a question of whether the Lord is good or bad, but a question of people; it is not so much a question of people, but a question of the inertia of a long history. China is trying to turn over, but China is too old.</p>
<h3>A Wall (1)</h3>
<p>— Original by Roberto Bracco, Translated by Xi Dichén</p>
<p>In ancient Naples, there were two connected, desolate, decaying buildings, where people multiplied like mice. On the high fifth floor, a thick wall separated two small rooms; separated so close, yet so far. These two rooms never interacted with each other. Even the beetles that crawled through the cracks that resembled deep wrinkles at night were different—the spiders covering the dirty walls on both sides were also different. But in the tomb-like silence of winter nights, the constant "da-da" sound of a sewing machine—monotonous, perpetual, and hurried—pierced through an invisible path; on one side, the ancient stone wall, the silent observer of the two rooms, seemed to come alive at that moment.</p>
<p>After struggling with his weary mind for a while, the young man finally decided to knock on the wall with his knuckles. He knocked several times before the sound of the sewing machine suddenly stopped. He felt relieved from a nightmare pressing on him, took a breath, and put his ear to the wall, listening to see if anyone would talk to him. He could hear a faint female voice speaking to him.</p>
<p>"Who is knocking on the wall?"</p>
<p>"Good woman, can you hear me?"</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>"Please don't be afraid, it's your neighbor."</p>
<p>"Then what is the matter?"</p>
<p>"Good woman, I beg you to stop your sewing machine and start again in the morning."</p>
<p>"I cannot wait until morning."</p>
<p>"You cannot! What does that have to do with me? I have the right to sleep."</p>
<p>"That is true, but I beg you, please have mercy and let me work."</p>
<p>"Do you have no other room, good woman?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"You can go outside to the top of the stairs—you can go outside—how would I know? To the paving stones."</p>
<p>"It's very cold tonight. And the door is locked, and I don't have the key."</p>
<p>"You are in your own room, yet you say you have no key to the door!"</p>
<p>"Truly, I don't."</p>

<h3>The Misty Records of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I think playing on land is not that interesting; if one could float in the sea, the joy would be even more unimaginable! But before going abroad, I must first visit all the major cities within our own country that can be reached by train. I have a special inclination for traveling, and whenever I think about our upcoming return from this trip, I feel incredibly unhappy.</p>
<p>Indeed, I believe that if the Empress Dowager would allow it, he would never want to go back. Because after returning, he can only be confined to the Forbidden City or the Summer Palace year-round; and within these prison-like areas, he still cannot move freely. To put it plainly, he is even worse off than those high-ranking eunuchs; and his words, whether commanding or supervising others, often have little effect, far inferior to those of us female officials favored by the Empress Dowager! Therefore, whenever he thinks of these situations, whenever he thinks of returning, a dim expression immediately appears in one of his eyes—those are a pair of large and very agile eyes. If the Empress Dowager did not completely seize his political power and still allowed him to dispose of things freely, he might have done some beneficial things for China. This is something he will always regret. But he never dares to express even half of this to the Empress Dowager. Readers, don't blame him for being too weak, because whether he is weak or strong, according to the customs of the palace, a mother can always act as regent for her son at any time, and the son, no matter what, cannot resist. Thus, Guangxu's talents were buried by this custom! I believe that his thoughts were indeed progressive, and his knowledge and ability were sufficient to shoulder the heavy burden of improving the Qing government, but unfortunately, the Empress Dowager was unwilling to give him the opportunity to display them.

<h3>Mad Woman</h3>
<p>— Zhao Xiaoyang</p>
<p>Near dusk, a large crowd suddenly gathered on the quiet Fumin Road!</p>
<p>"Look at the madwoman! Look at the madwoman!" A strange and shrill cry kept echoing in the air, and I was finally driven by curiosity! I went up without hesitation to find out what was going on;</p>
<p>"Arresting people? We haven't broken the law! Rui'er? Where's your dad!" A middle-aged woman raised her voice and shouted frantically:</p>
<p>A dirty face, messy hair, and tattered clothes fully showed that she was a mad woman. Beside her stood a child of about ten years old, probably her son.</p>
<p>"Child, is this your mother?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" He nodded in response.</p>
<p>"How did you end up in this state?" After many people inquired, the child finally told us the whole story: "We are from X County in Jiangxi Province. My father ran a small grocery store in the county town. Although it was small, the business was very prosperous. Unexpectedly, in the autumn of last year, the Red Bandits suddenly threatened to invade our county town. At that time, the news was extremely urgent. A regiment of soldiers stationed in the county town took the opportunity to ask for money and things from the shops, finally looting everything! Later! The rampant Red Bandits captured the city and entered, searching every household aggressively. They took money from those who had it, and arrested those who didn't. My father was taken away by them! His life or death is still unknown. Moreover, they set fire to everything. We fled this tiger's den in a panic and finally ended up in Shanghai. Now, all the money we brought is used up! We can't find any relatives, and after such a severe shock, my mother's nerves gradually became disordered!"</p>
<p>As the child said this, tears flowed like a spring.</p>
<p>The onlookers felt a little sad! Indignant! Sighing! Giving them some copper coins in unison.</p>
<p>"Arresting people! We haven't broken the law! Rui'er! Where's your dad!" The middle-aged woman still raised her voice and shouted frantically.</p>
<p>Alas! Who created their tragic tragedy!</p>
<h3>Free Stage</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shouchéng</p>
<p>No gongs, no drums, and no velvet embroidered curtains, just a spot on the cement sidewalk, occupying a place, using chalk to outline the four large white characters "Free Stage."</p>
<p>Can't find noble gentlemen and ladies, and it's hardest to find modern young men and girls. Standing, standing around, are all short-clothed laborers, sweating coolies, homeless wanderers, and villagers who have just entered the embrace of the city.</p>
<p>Waving a broken fan, painting the face of a clown, wearing glasses with frames but no lenses, our artist, paired with his "assistant," tells some shallow and vulgar jokes, and imitates various local dialects, making the audience laugh, but the pain in their own hearts is deeply hidden in their bitter smiles.</p>
<p>The play begins: the broken erhu makes a "so-so" sound, playing his sad life, stirring his depressed sorrow, humming with a hoarse throat! "Shopkeeper, bring over the yellow horse" reminds him of his own frustrated life and unfortunate encounters, can he be compared to Qin Qiong in his prime? He can't help but use a generous "long song in place of weeping"! Look at the blue veins on his forehead sticking out red, the little braid attached to the top of his head trembling, this time the tune has to be more vigorous and more flavorful! The adults applaud, the children laugh wildly, it's a pity there's no beam, otherwise, how could it stop echoing for three days?</p>
<p>Begging for alms, holding a broken cap in his hand to beg for money from the audience. However, people are gradually dispersing, although some people understand what the meaning of "relying on friends when you're out" is. But reaching into their own pockets, thinking about tomorrow's food and clothing, they can't help but take a breath of cold air and quietly slip away. Only our street singer remains, standing alone on the cement sidewalk in a daze.</p>
<h3>Forwarder</h3>

<h3>Bare-chested</h3>
<p>— Wéi Jīng</p>
<p>Chinese people have a habit of going bare-chested in the summer. Generally, when the temperature is around ninety degrees, the laborers and coolies, those who sell their labor, need not be mentioned, are naturally all bare-chested. Even the friends climbing the counters in the southern goods stores, oil and wine workshops, and cigarette and paper sundries stores, the waiters in noodle shops and restaurants, and the stall vendors in the streets and alleys are all "lighting big candles" (a euphemism for being bare-chested). And what's even stranger is that those who wave banana leaf fans to escape the heat and enjoy the cool air are also bare-chested, walking on the streets.</p>
<p>Being bare-chested is one of the reasons why foreigners look down on Chinese people. Therefore, bare-chested people are not allowed to set foot in the parks, and bare-chested people will be driven off the trams by the ticket sellers. In recent years, we Chinese people seem to have become aware of this, so the Public Security Bureau has specially prepared a lot of undershirts for the police to give to bare-chested people after fining them, to cover their bodies. Therefore, the number of bare-chested people in the streets is now not as vast as it used to be.</p>
<p>The number of men who are bare-chested is decreasing day by day, but the number of women who are bare-chested is increasing day by day. In the hot weather, women in social situations don't just bare their arms, they also expose their shoulders. Now they have gone a step further, exposing their entire backs, and only using a bra to cover their breasts. This is the case in social situations, in cars, and when walking in the green shade. Men being bare-chested is barbaric, women being bare-chested is Europeanized and modern, there is nothing in the world more understandable and incomprehensible than this.</p>

<h3>Talking About Tropical Fish (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Bīng Yù</p>
<p>In recent years, the trend of raising tropical fish has been popular in various countries, because there are dozens of species of tropical fish that are more beautiful and exotic than goldfish, and they are also docile in nature and reproduce quickly, so everyone loves to play with them. My friend Lou Junfang returned from the United States and mentioned that Americans used to be very fond of goldfish, but now, because there are fewer good species, they have changed their approach and love to raise tropical fish. The Eastern country of Japan, which is the richest in imitative and speculative spirit, is also at its peak, importing various tropical fish from tropical places such as Southeast Asia, India, South America, and Africa. Even I have gradually started to love raising them. When Lou Jun returned to China, he selected and purchased dozens of species, built a fish room, and raised them with great care. I visited his residence last month. He used glass tanks to raise them separately. Here, based on what I have seen, I will continue to describe the species and breeding methods of fish:</p>
<p>(1) Species There are about fifty species of tropical fish, and the freshwater species are the most beautiful in color, such as (1) Rainbowfish, which is a small fish produced in Central America, similar in shape to a guppy. The male fish has red, yellow, green, blue, purple, and other overlapping round spots, scattered in the black-spotted pattern, like the colorful colors of a rainbow, and is two inches long. This fish is viviparous and can produce thirty to forty small fish each time. (2) Top Minnow is produced in small rivers and ponds in Central America and the southern part of North America. It is similar in shape to a ribbonfish, and its dorsal and ventral fins are exactly the same as those of a ribbonfish, but they are slightly larger, with white spots on a black background. The characteristic of this fish is that it can live in rotten and unclean water, and it likes to eat mosquito larvae and microorganisms the most. Therefore, in the Hawaiian Islands, the Philippine Islands, and South America, to prevent the harm of malaria mosquitoes, raising this fish can prevent the occurrence of mosquito larvae, so it is also called mosquito fish. (3) Mlolliensia is larger than the Top Minnow, about three to four inches long, and has a very developed dorsal fin, like the sail of a sailboat. It grows in slightly salty ponds in northern Mexico and has black stripes all over its body, slightly reddish-gray, with an orange-yellow head and chest, and some have a purplish-blue body with a white halo around the eyes. (4) Swordtail is also produced in Central America and Mexico, with the tail end like a sword, pointed and long in a straight line, the tail is green-black, with a hint of green or yellow, and the body has alternating horizontal stripes of yellow and black, but the female fish</p>
<p>has no sword tail and is slightly larger in shape than the rainbow fish. (5) Red helihri This fish is similar to the dragon species of goldfish with raised flags. It is a hybrid of swordtail and moon fish. The colors and shapes vary. There are orange-yellow, silver-white, and greenish-green colors, with horizontal stripes on the abdomen, and some have black spots arranged side by side. (6) Moon fish is produced in South America and Mexico. It is similar in shape to a one-year-old crucian carp and resembles the grass species of goldfish, but there are three colors. The first has a greenish-blue luster, the second is vermilion red with black spots, and the third is dark black with moon-shaped spots. The tail and ventral fins have black spots. (7) Panchax is produced in tropical America, Africa, India, and other places. Its characteristic is that the fins and tail have very beautiful colors. The African species has six black lines on its body and cinnamon-yellow spots on its gill covers. Some have a completely red body with bright red lines. The Indian species has a completely greenish-green body, the fins have large red spots, and the tail is green with alternating red, black, and white colors. Some have a completely greenish-yellow body covered with seven rows of large red spots. (8) Rivulus has a slender body shape, similar to a loach. It is produced in Brazil and Central America. It is good at jumping and often floats on the water to rest. Its color is similar to a loach mixed with large red stripes, the same as the swimming fish produced in Shaoxing. The fins are yellow, and some have a completely golden body. (9) Janurius is similar to our Dingban fish. The whole body is gray-yellow, with black spots scattered all over the body. It is produced in small rivers and ponds in the West Indies, Central America, and South America.</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 31 Three Battles White-Clad Soldiers Charge Through Snowdrifts Entire Battalion Sacrifices Red-Eyed Soldiers Enter Gunfire</p>
<p>Zi Qiang stood at the head of the first company, closely following the company in front. Guan Yaowu squatted down his large body, slightly raising his cap, revealing a piece of forehead, holding a rifle in both hands, staring with his eyes, gritting his teeth, looking forward, stopping for a few minutes, twisting the gun mechanism, extremely showing the attitude of this old soldier. This time in battle, the enemy was coming from the southeast. Although everyone had not relaxed the northwest side, this battalion had suffered a quarter of its casualties, and now it had to focus all its energy on dealing with the southeast corner. Although the enemy infantry could not make progress, they were unwilling to retreat, only holding on. But they could not advance on the ground, but in the air they were being pressed hard by two buzzing planes, circling in the sky above the fort. They flew lower and lower, successively dropping seven or eight bombs. The dust everywhere, like the water spraying from a fountain, surged straight up, blinding the eyes of the defenders. At the same time, from within the enemy's lines, bullets densely shot towards the fort. Although the defenders ignored the planes and bombs in the sky, the bombs fell closer and closer, directly in front of the defenders, the flying soil blinding their eyes, the ground shaking their bodies, making them very uncomfortable. The enemy then launched a dense attack again, as if a person was surrounded by artillery fire from all directions. At this time, Zi Qiang not only did not know fear, but was also burning with anger, wishing he could grab the tail of the plane with both hands and throw it out of the fort. Just as he was hating this, he heard a boom in his ears, his whole body went numb, and he lost consciousness for two or three minutes. When he woke up, he saw that where Guan Yaowu was guarding, the fort wall had been blown into a gap. The fort wall had become a slope, and the broken soil was falling downwards. He and a dozen or so brothers nearby were nowhere to be found. At the same time, the enemies outside the fort, with a miserable shout, hundreds of people, holding guns with bayonets fixed, aimed at this gap, and rushed over like a whirlwind. Although Zi Qiang held a rifle and shot at the few people in front, they were numerous, what use was it. (431)</p>

<h3>Securities: Continuous wild jumps lead to reaction; 96 plummets to limit down; Overall decline of more than one yuan to four yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange suddenly experienced a fierce reversal, especially with 96 stocks being the most peculiar. There was a limit up on Monday, but yesterday it suddenly fell to a limit down. Only one day passed. They are raised as if they are about to go to the clouds, and pressed down as if they will enter hell. Wild rises and falls are treated as child's play. The recklessness of speculators is a great harm to the market. The big drop in various bonds is also affected by this. Initially, it has nothing to do with the capital of the bond market. Observing the environmental situation, there is no reason for a sudden drop. A slight reversal is expected, and there should still be a rise in the future. The agitation of 96 stocks will not easily subside, and there should still be significant fluctuations. Yesterday's process was due to the abnormal interday trading, even much higher than the near term, so there was a tendency to level out. For example, the initial auction of this month's small cut of the regular army was a tenth of a yuan, while the forward period was six and a half tenths of a yuan lower. The market price then rose to level. Also, because the military reduction rose sharply by three yuan and three tenths the day after, compared with the gold short of only one tenth and a half, it was too absurd. Therefore, the military reduction fell by about one yuan, which is still nothing more than leveling the market price. However, the general floating surplus is afraid of causing a drop, and there is a lot of cashing out. The market price is gradually becoming sluggish. However, the monthly amount of uniform tax, gold short, and whole six is still good by three tenths to seven tenths. The 96 stocks suddenly rose and fell sharply, which has never followed the same steps as other bonds. This will continue to be the case in the future. In the second session, the floating surplus cashed out, and the drop did not stop, continuing to drop by one or two yuan. This month's 96 stocks plummeted to 15 yuan, the limit down. However, the dark disk was trading at 15 yuan and a half. The future trend of 96 stocks should not fall sharply again due to demand, and it should stabilize for a while. As a result, the market price generally fell by more than one yuan to four yuan. The total transaction volume is estimated to be more than 30 million yuan. The rise and fall are listed below (in yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Stagnant with No Change</h3>
<p>Xinhua Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market was unusually sluggish yesterday (9th), with very small fluctuations. This is because US government bonds advanced to a new peak, while cotton futures soared due to the sharp reduction in cotton fields. Speculative attention is focused on government bonds and cotton. However, special stocks were still active, and several elite stocks broke the high record of this year. Steel stocks stabilized due to the sharp increase in steel work. According to the report of the Steel Society, the amount of work is now 27.5%, while last week it was only 23%. Speculators were satisfied with the statement by Pan Kela, a member of the Securities and Exchange Management Committee, that the new management committee would be constructive. The situation in the small exchange market was also stagnant, with slightly lower and mixed results. Bond prices saw mixed ups and downs, with a slight rise in prices. German government bonds tended to level out. Wheat fell due to the abundant harvest in the fields, indicating an increase in supply. The total transaction volume for the day was 320,000 shares. According to the report of the New York agent of this firm, (securities) trading was extremely stagnant, with almost no change. (Grains) Increased supply by 8 million bushels (English bushels), selling pressure increased, and prices fell. The market is already oversold, and there should be a sharp upward rebound in the short term. (Cotton) The market situation rose due to the government's cotton field report being favorable to the bullish side, and brokers bought in. At the same time, the bullish side and the South sold at high prices, and the rise was slightly curbed. Interest in cloth is stronger than before, but transactions have not increased, and prices have not risen. The spot market is calm and the base is firm. (Rubber) The market situation is calm and trading is sluggish, waiting for new developments. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Finance Silver Price Suddenly Plummets, Margin Rises Again by 3.5 Yuan, Banks Vigorously Dump US Dollar Exchange Rate, A Ten-Day Process of First Rising and Then Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a sharp contraction in silver futures, with sentiment initially optimistic, leading to further increases. However, due to continued forceful selling by banks, the domestic US dollar exchange rate shifted from tight to loose, and even Shengda (a major player) started selling, causing gold prices to rise initially but then decline. Nevertheless, the underlying trend remained firm. In the morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and the US both contracted, with deferred silver prices on the stock exchange shrinking by 4.4% to 1.2%. Exchange rates fell slightly, London spot gold rose by 1 penny, US cotton rose by 37 points, and US wheat fell by 2.25 points. Stock prices saw slight fluctuations. In off-exchange forward trading, prices rose to 94.45 yuan. Although the situation stabilized after the opening, there were many sellers, and the market turned downward. Continued forceful selling by banks undermined confidence. Although HSBC's listed price contracted, the domestic market eased, leading to a surge of sellers and a decline. The Guangdong trading houses (Guangbang Shengda) also sold US dollars at even lower prices. Only a Reuters dispatch stated that the US Treasury Department had announced that the mint had taken in 1,427,000 ounces of silver, adding that last week's market increase was not sufficient to cause surprise at the government's silver purchasing policy. Although this lacked significant impact, banks' forceful selling made it difficult for the market to sustain itself. Later, as banks took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, sentiment stabilized somewhat, enabling a recovery. Finally, news came from the Seattle night market that silver prices were reported to be up 125.125.25.125. The midday market was flat. In the afternoon, news came from the Seattle night market that silver prices were up 25, unchanged, and down 125.25. The Bombay market also rose by 2 annas. The market opened calmly, but underlying bullish sentiment persisted, and the market gradually stabilized. The foreign exchange market was quiet, with extremely narrow fluctuations. Before closing, it rose slightly once, but the closing price remained flat.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton US Cotton Estimates Favor Bulls, Margin Yarn Scattered Shorts Start to Cover</h3>
<p>The yarn market remained firm because the US cotton acreage estimate report favored the bulls, causing the shorts to be disappointed and the market to turn firm. The opening sentiment was quite good, with scattered shorts covering positions more vigorously, causing the rise to accelerate. Later, due to sluggish sales of spot yarn, it fell slightly, but the underlying market remained tight. Currently, there are mixed views.</p>
<h3>Golden Chicken Rises Six Jiao</h3>
<p>The margin yarn pre-market opening saw bullish sentiment due to rising US cotton, with scattered longs covering positions, resulting in a positive situation. Prices for each month rose by 1.3, 4, and 5 jiao. After two or three rounds of auctions, some of the profitable longs closed their positions, causing the market to turn downward. As a result, prices for each month rose by 5, 6, and 7 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 27,700 bales.

<h3>New Cotton Has the Strongest Upward Trend</h3>
<p>The cotton market trended firm, and the rising trend was especially intense, because the US cotton acreage report favored the longs, rising 35 points, and the exchange rate shrank, causing sentiment to become increasingly bullish. The buying trend was suddenly strong, and there were even more scattered shorts covering their positions, and some even switched from short to long. As a result, the new cotton rose even more sharply, and the local climate remained dry, affecting the development of cotton plants.</p>
<h3>Zheng Margin Rises Five to Six Jiao</h3>
<p>The margin cotton pre-market opening saw US cotton rising 35 points in telephone reports, with the government acreage estimate at 28,024,000 acres, a reduction of one million acres compared to private estimates. As a result, sentiment was shaken, and the shorts covered their positions without price limits, causing the market price to rise more sharply than the yarn market. Round after round, prices went higher, and some speculators leaned towards taking long positions. The weather was very dry, further impacting the new cotton, and the rising power of the local cotton was particularly strong. Prices for each month rose by 4.5 and 6 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 112,600 dan. Jifeng sold 2,900 dan, Dafu 8,000 dan, Taixing 2,600 dan, Shenchang 6,600 dan, Hengde 5,200 dan, Shenji 5,300 dan, Taichang 1,700 dan, Dachang 1,800 dan, Xincheng 3,600 dan, and Senkang 1,300 dan.

<h3>Raw Cotton Factories Need to Stop Production</h3>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still weak, with a source of 110 bales of Tonghua.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Rises by 37 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was affected by the Department of Agriculture report. The market price first rose due to foreign merchants buying, and then softened due to some longs closing their positions. As a result, both futures and spot prices rose by 30 to 37 points compared to yesterday. At the same time, the Liverpool cotton report stated that the US cotton standard rose by 6 to 7 points. The Bombay cotton report first fell due to longs closing their positions, and then rose due to shorts covering their positions. The original telephone reports are recorded below:</p>

<h3>United States Cotton Field Report</h3>
<p>Washington, 9th telegram. The United States Cotton Production Estimate Bureau published the US cotton cultivated land area from 1934 to 1935, totaling 28,024,000 acres, 12,774,000 acres less than last year. The cotton field reports for the last six years are listed below (unit: thousand acres): 1934-1935 28,024 1931-1932 41,491</p>
<p>1933-1934 40,798 1930-1931 45,815</p>
<p>1932-1933 37,290 1929-1930 8,457</p>
<h3>Grain Factory Continues to Dump, Flour Market Gradually Weakens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning, showed signs of initial stability followed by a decline. Foreign wheat quotations showed Chicago falling by about 5-7 jiao and Canada smaller by 1-2 jiao. When prices were opened, due to the continued dry and rainless weather, outside sentiment still involved buying, so prices for each month were better by about half a point. Subsequently, factories such as Fu Fu successively dumped, and the market atmosphere appeared weak. The market also spread estimates that US wheat increased by 8 million bushels, and rumors circulated that Dalian dumped Australian flour, which seemed to indicate that the port's continued export would be heavily affected. Regarding the actual situation of foreign wheat, it was heard that Argentina's current wheat price, including import tax, was about 4.67 yuan, so if the port's flour price exceeded 2.3 yuan, the import of foreign wheat would be inevitable. In a time of rural decline, importing foreign wheat would likely not be a blessing for the country and society. As a result, the current month was unchanged, August was slightly smaller by 1 fen, September and October were each smaller by 7.5 li, and November and December were each smaller by 1.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Northern Customers Hedge-Sell Future Wheat</h3>
<p>Longer-term periods were dragged down by 3-4 fen</p>
<p>Yesterday's future wheat market presented a picture of stability. Foreign wheat prices were Canada, ranging from 5 to 7 jiao... So, when the opening price, although sentiment was stable, it was soon influenced by selling. After that, market conditions were flat and weak due to floating prices from hedge-selling customers. Until the afternoon opening, market conditions for each month were weak, because although the areas south of the Yangtze River were experiencing famine due to prolonged drought, the producing areas in the north had ample rainfall and smooth rivers. Therefore, the transport and customer trading was quite active. Afterwards, the near market was dragged down due to Jinpu Road-area customers selling a standard, and the Liao futures. However, this port ultimately feels the pressure of a long drought, and outside thoughts are unlikely to be overly impulsive. As a result, the current month was smaller by one fen, August was smaller by four fen, September was smaller by three fen, October was smaller by two fen, November was smaller by four fen, and December was smaller by one fen. Current wheat market conditions are still stable, with the source being continued, and the factory's appetite is still active. Xuzhou wheat opened at 3.08 yuan, Wuhe wheat at 3.06 yuan, Linhuaiguan wheat at 3.046 yuan, Mingguang wheat at 3.05 yuan, Anting wheat at 2.73 yuan, Wuhu wheat at 2.85 yuan, and secondary at 8 jiao, Daqiao wheat at 2.95 yuan, and secondary at 9 jiao, Pukou wheat at 2.85 yuan, and secondary at 8 jiao, Bengbu wheat at 3.045 yuan, Jiangxinzhou wheat at 2.92 yuan, and secondary at 9 jiao, Xin'an wheat at 3.08 yuan. Fuxin went to 10,000 bales, Fufeng went to 2,000 bales, and Xinda went to 2,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Rising Trend Continues</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from various groups continued to have very few arrivals due to Tianfu and shallow inner ports, only about 15 or 16 (about 2,600 or 2,700 stones of goods). The market situation trended high. The reason for the price increases was actually that in recent days there has been no rain at all, drought conditions have formed, and the rice-producing areas in the mainland have all been hindered by small and large Hao. Even if there is rice, it cannot be transported out, and farmers are concerned about protecting the new rice crop, and are busy irrigating, and they have no time to pull out the chaff from the rice. As a result, the source is scarce, and there are still panicking people in the Shanghai market who originally prepared one stone, and now they have prepared two or three stones, and the sales field has tripled, and supply cannot meet demand. The prices of various rice types have soared. The Changbang Baijing has risen to as high as 11.5 yuan, and now the prices of various groups of late rice and japonica rice have continued to rise by more than 3 jiao. Du Yangjian and Yinbianyuan also have 2 jiao of the same style.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources for each group downstream were a dozen or so. The go-to market goods, Baijing continued to move, and the price rose by 3 or 4 jiao. Baiyuan Japonica continued to move, and the price also increased by 4 or 5 jiao. Yang Du Bu Jian transactions were ordinary, and the price increased by 2 or 3 jiao. Ke Jian's appetite for goods continued from this street and the surrounding countryside, and the price increased by 2 jiao and 4 fen. Early rice also increased by 2 or 3 jiao.</p>
<h3>Chongming Group Begins to Handle Foreign Customer Xian</h3>
<p>Saigon rice lures in fixed clients with a price of 10 yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of customer xian was still looking good with people still hoping because of the drought without rain. Also, the river rice from the riverbed was becoming more scarce and the selling price was steadily rising. Therefore, the cargo owners all shouted for higher prices. However, yesterday the land group which had been actively buying for successive days suddenly stopped, and other incoming houses uniformly lowered the price, so the market immediately turned flat. Although japonica rice rose, the foreign customer xian rice in turn became a flat position. Afterwards, the Chongming group suddenly rose up to purchase, and people from this street and stockpilers also inquired, and the market turned active again. However, the trend temporarily stabilized, and a total of 2,500 small twisted bags, 2,130 rough bags, and 5,000 machine rice bags were opened up all day. Most of them were handled by this street and the stockpilers. Chongming went to more than 2,000 bags, and the mainland also responded to several Jing machines, and the trend was similar to the closing price of the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yunfu Bank received a telegram from Saigon, stating that No. 1 Saigon He Shen slightly exceeded 10 yuan, and went to the market to solicit fixed clients. This price is not in line with the current market price, but the rice price will rise again after that, and it is possible to set a price. Because of the above reasons, market sentiment turned down in the afternoon, and the small twisted rice returned from 8.2 yuan to 8.05 yuan. Finally, some people were willing to return it at a price of 8 yuan. The guest xian rice in each stall was also softened.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Grain Exported to Tianjin</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Ping-Shen Railway, Northern merchant guilds have been actively procuring grain in Shanghai. In the past two weeks, over 400,000 bags of flour and 30,000 bags of rice have been shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin. This year, British merchant ships and China Merchants’ "Xin Ming" and other ships have exported approximately 200,000 bags of flour and 6,000-7,000 bags of rice to Tianjin. It is said that of the large quantities of grain being shipped to Tianjin, half will be transported out of the customs area.</p>
<h3>Soybean Harvest Expected to Suffer Losses</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for soybeans was high, with a total of 57-58 cartloads of various soybeans traded throughout the city ("Market prices detailed in the market price section"). It is reported that oil factories purchased over 50 cartloads, but prices only increased slightly by two or three cents because factories were unwilling to pay higher prices, so sellers had to settle for lower profits. Currently, there is not much potential for development in the soybean market because the new soybean crop has been affected by drought. The "Cowhide Yellow" soybeans from Changzhou may only yield 20-30% of the usual harvest, while soybeans from Hankou may yield 60%. However, soybeans from Jiangxi are in better condition.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Prices Rise Slightly with Customs Gold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight improvement due to the increase in the value of customs gold. The guild's benchmark price for spot raw sugar (24 purity) was 20.03 yuan, with the price for delivery at the pier at 20.15 yuan, and the price for goods in our warehouse at 20.20 yuan. Taikoo Sugar's "B" mark sugar increased by 10 cents to 20.60 yuan. Milled white sugar from our factory, Zhenyu No. 1, was 18.80 yuan, a slight increase of 10 cents. The trading board only offered over 100 boxes of Nanning slab sugar at a price of 10.02 yuan. Jianbang offered over 60 bags of large-packaged rock sugar at a price of 23.30 yuan. It is said that white slab sugar was sporadically offered, with varying quality and prices ranging from a few cents higher or lower. The price of Chaoqing sugar was raised on the trading board, but businesses were hesitant to buy due to sluggish sales, so they took a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<h3>North Gate Goods: Lack of Wood Ear Supply Leads to Sharp Price Increase</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai market has experienced a shortage of wood ear supply, and the number of arrivals from Hankou has also been low, leading to a gradual price increase. Yesterday, Hankou telegraphed another price increase of 3 yuan. Trading board prices here have risen by 4-5 yuan in total. Original Hankou packages of mixed wood ear sold for over 86 yuan, and further price increases are expected.</p>
<p>New Jin Cabbage: The higher-quality Xuzhou cabbage is selling for 24.5 yuan. It is said that the number of subsequent arrivals will definitely increase, and there may be a possibility of prices loosening. The second batch of Shaoxing cabbage is expected to arrive around today.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Hot Weather Causes Tea Market to Slow Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai experienced a slowdown in activity at foreign firms due to the extremely hot weather. Many British tea merchants temporarily suspended operations, and foreign firms reduced negotiations and pricing for non-urgent goods. Total transactions in the city for various grades of red and green boxed tea were only over 1,900 boxes, with no significant changes in prices. However, the high and mid-grade Zhenmei green tea continued to sell best in all tea markets, while the others were slightly sluggish. The situation for Qimen black tea remained weak.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Camel Wool Fabric Already Has Fixed Orders</h3>
<p>Recently, the hot weather has caused the woolen fabric business to be slow. However, domestically produced wide and narrow camel wool fabric has already been launched on the market, and fixed orders have been placed by various factories, including Weilun, Tianxiang, Weiyi, Xianda, Shengda, Dadong, Danan, Huadong, Hongfa, Maoye, Shenchang, and Jinglun. Merchants from Rongping have also been actively importing, and weaving orders have been placed on this street. The best quality fabric is generally selling for 1.90 yuan, second quality for 1.65 yuan, third quality for 1.40 yuan, fur back for 2.50 yuan, and artistic fabric for 2.25 yuan. Transactions at Xiangyu Gong and Xieji Xing second warehouses have been relatively lively.</p>
<h3>Hardware: US Steel Sales in Tianjin Are Active</h3>
<p>Due to the shutdown of factories on this street, the market for 200-pound US steel has become sluggish. The industry is quite pessimistic due to the low actual sales, and prices have been quietly easing, with each box being offered at 28 yuan. In the past few days, merchants from Tianjin seem to be active, offering 300-400 boxes. Factories on this street have also inquired about prices because the slack season is about to pass, so the overall situation in the city is no longer as pessimistic as before.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Heatwave</h3>
<p>— Cen</p>
<p>These past two days, everyone is suffering from the heatwave's assault. Thermometers are rising above 100 degrees, with America exceeding 120 degrees, and people even dying from the heat. Shanghai's heat is also considerable, and epidemics are gradually spreading. In the evening, roadsides are filled with people. During the day, it's impossible to work in offices, and at night, it's even more impossible to sleep. This heat is truly tormenting everyone.</p>
<p>However, there are those who are not afflicted by the heatwave, namely some wealthy people and so-called important figures. They can go to places like Mogan Mountain to escape the heat, or they have comfortable cooling facilities in Shanghai, such as summer houses, electric fans blowing, drinking ice cream and Dutch water, playing mahjong, and taking car rides in the evening. They don't feel the extreme heat. The most suffering are the dockworkers, rickshaw pullers, and factory workers. They are the ones who truly suffer. They are either running and carrying things under the scorching sun or trapped in stuffy machine rooms. This is simply an inhuman existence. However, to earn a living, they have no choice but to endure the suffering. This is social injustice that everyone immediately recognizes.</p>
<p>Similar to this natural phenomenon, recent world politics have also reached a very high level of heatwave. The military disarmament disputes in Western Europe have reached an unbearable point. Almost the entire Europe is completely engulfed in an atmosphere of war. At the same time, Japan's anti-Soviet struggle in the East is also intensifying. Britain, America, and Japan; America and Japan; Germany and France; France and Italy; these major opposing forces are almost all drawing their swords, and war is imminent. However, they also have a common enemy: Russia. Russia is considered a common adversary, so in principle, they must eliminate it. However, their internal contradictions prevent them from immediately forming an anti-Russian front. Nevertheless, their goal of opposing Russia remains unwavering. The more unstable the world is, the more they intensify their anti-Russian efforts. In this way, the world's conflict is intensified in a new form and with new content. Furthermore, standing in the same direction and position as Russia is the unrest of poor people around the world, which causes great anxiety among these other nations. Thus, in addition to the conflicts between countries, there are also the conflicts between groups of people, intensifying the chaos and making it the center of the turmoil. Therefore, today's world politics are expressed with a more intense level of conflict. Everything indicates the intensification and increase of this heat, which is no different from the increase in the heatwave in the natural world in recent days.</p>
<p>The heatwave in the natural world will eventually recede. And to make this heatwave recede, there must be a downpour of rain. World politics also needs to go through a heavy rain before it can return to a cool world, sweeping away the heatwave among people worldwide.</p>
<h3>Disaster</h3>
<p>— Xi Zhen</p>
<p>Look: Another scorching sun today!</p>
<p>I had just called A'hu to go and find work, about half an incense stick's time later, Third Uncle came back from the field shirtless, wearing a sweat-soaked cloth shirt. He saw Third Grandson, who had come from the city, sitting in the main room.</p>
<p>He nodded, dropped the sweat-soaked shirt, pulled over a stool, sat down, and the gray shadow of the future floated up again:</p>
<p>(Famine! Sweat flows, a blood-red sun, drooping branches, dry yellow rice stalks, powder-like yellow soil. It's over, it's over again! Looking at the rice price of ten yuan and seven jiao per dan in the city, it's going to be another year of starvation.)</p>
<p>Since dawn, I've been tirelessly pedaling water on the double-wheeled cart. When the sun beats down, the powder-like soil absorbs the water as soon as it touches it, and then it dries up again immediately. After six hours of carrying water, it's still the same. But seeing that the water in the small river has dried up, what can be done? What can be done?</p>
<p>Thinking, I seemed to see A'hu panting on the cart frame and the fallen rice stalks, and sighed:</p>
<p>"It's another famine year! Famine every two out of three years, how can we survive?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it? Nothing goes right these days. Farming leads to famine, business leads to famine - one place is barren, everywhere is barren, nothing goes right!"</p>
<p>Listening to Third Grandson's tone from the city, I echoed and sighed, "These days, things have really changed. Even the heavens have lost their eyes."</p>
<p>(Didn't I hear that a Living Buddha came to Shanghai in the spring, and a Taoist ceremony was held in Hangzhou? But we're still going through such a year.)</p>
<p>These days, nothing seems to prosper, no matter what you do.</p>
<p>Thinking, the shadow of fifty years of hardship floated up again: I've lived for over fifty years, and hardly a year has been good. Just take the recent years: floods, war, drought. We were lucky to have a slightly better harvest last year, but the grain couldn't be sold for money. Every year, all we hear are new terms for some kind of donation or tax.</p>
<p>"Farming is really not something for humans to do. Living in the countryside these days is just waiting to die."</p>
<p>"But isn't it the same in the city?" Third Grandson kept saying "city, city." "My cousin just came back from Shanghai last month. He said that since the beginning of the year, dozens of factories have closed down, and there's no work to be done."</p>
<p>Everyone fell silent, thinking: No road leads anywhere these days.</p>
<p>Looking at the scorching sun outside, my heart felt like it had been doused with boiling water. It's over, it's over. Thirteen households in the village pooled their money to hire a Taoist priest to pray for rain the day before yesterday; but what use is that? We can only use the foreign water pump, but the foreign pump boats have already been booked. And seeing that I don't even have much rice left over from last year, where would I get the money?</p>
<p>Thinking of the drooping rice stalks in the field, thinking of the various kinds of taxes (which Third Uncle never understood clearly), thinking of the autumn rent rice, thinking of the family's food for the year...</p>
<p>A thought flashed through my mind: I'll put everything down! I don't care, we only have a few lives left anyway, let's just wait, let's just wait. I remembered what A'hu had heard in the city:</p>
<p>"When things get really bad, we'll prepare to do something with blood!"</p>
<p>"Do something!"</p>
<p>But, according to Third Grandson, you don't get a share even if you do something these days, you don't get anything.</p>
<p>Both hearts were like being soaked in rain.</p>
<p>In the distance, A'hu came again, sweating profusely: "Damn it, it's really bad, the water in the small river has dried up, what's the point of carrying water? We can only use the foreign water pump!"</p>
<p>"Use the foreign water pump, use the foreign water pump!"</p>
<p>But, it's certain: It's over, it's over!</p>
<p>However, suddenly, my heart felt much lighter again. Ahead of me is a great hope, unpredictable, preparing, preparing.</p>
<p>Slowly, I heard Third Grandson standing up and saying, "I'm planning to take over that small cigarette shop after the summer. In recent months, no one has even bought five-cent cigarettes."</p>
<h3>Over a Million Yuan in Cosmetics Expenses</h3>
<p>— Shuang Ping</p>
<p>It was precisely because of the desire to leverage women's patriotic fervor to resist foreign goods that the so-called Women's National Goods Year was invented. Since the slogan of Women's National Goods Year has been used to promote one's own products, many commercial establishments that promote national goods have indeed increased their business considerably.</p>
<p>However, the customs report on the total number of women's products imported into Shanghai in May of this year gives us disappointing news. Last year, the import of perfumes and cosmetics did not exceed 2.5 million yuan. Concerned people were already quite surprised by this, and thus the organization of the Women's National Goods Movement. However, this year's customs statistics for five months say that the number of women's products imported was 1.11 million yuan, including 229,610 yuan for cosmetic tools, 136,240 yuan for real and imitation jewelry, and 747,627 yuan for perfumes and cosmetics. This figure is even more considerable.</p>
<p>Whether our beauty-loving sisters are trying to joke with the old gentlemen who advocate National Goods Year, I cannot know. However, this news is quite thought-provoking.</p>
<p>At a time when men are working hard to seduce women and women are losing their self-esteem, lipsticks and perfumes are indispensable. Since everyone is using strange costumes to decorate civilization, and women who have not thoroughly awakened are using this to enjoy themselves, no matter how you advocate frugality, it will be useless.</p>
<p>In fact, 1.11 million yuan of lipstick and perfume is not a very large number, but many men who have forgotten their own extravagance are making a fuss and using it as a reason to scold women. If you didn't import these things, where would people buy them? You should know that this is not just women's fault, but it is our women who are being scolded.</p>
<p>Don't men use perfume and face powder? We often see them buying these things, especially on the street, we can smell the perfume on men. Are they using national goods? Not necessarily.</p>
<h3>People Abandoned by the Summer Heat</h3>
<p>— Ying Ying</p>
<p>A place that cannot be considered a house, actually only has enough room to hold a few people.</p>
<p>The husband: A person suffering from severe neurasthenia who has been abandoned by his family!</p>
<p>The wife: Excessive labor has taken away her previous health, and her beautiful face has slowly become a thin, long face with many wrinkles!</p>
<p>The son: Just came into the world, not even a full month old; but I believe he is definitely not a strong child! He has his father's weak build and the same thin face as his mother.</p>
<p>They cannot always have a full stomach. Of course, there is no talk of drinking soda; if every time the sun fiercely demonstrates towards them, ah, they can only lower their bodies and cannot escape!</p>
<p>Heaven, heaven is so narrow-minded, it won't let even the poorest people eat their fill. It is unwilling to let the poor have the right to eat their fill! On the contrary, it is preparing to grant them more opportunities to be close to the heat.</p>
<p>His whole body is covered with many heat blisters that have been burned by the heat.</p>
<p>The husband had also thought about this for a while. A long-term stay in a pigeon coop to resist the heat will definitely produce more than just these few heat blisters. If there is such a hot day again, and perhaps someone in the house is in even greater danger, what should be done?</p>
<p>The wife said, let's spend some time in the park to restore some vitality. It seems that this suggestion is fresh enough; but the husband shook his head, indicating that she was still a disappointment that was a waste of words.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that it is difficult to get rid of the facts during the day. I hope to go to someone else's house to spend some time avoiding the heat, but it is still not very embarrassing, especially if it is an unemployed person who is often honored with a visit, I would rather bow and retreat; the fact is not preparing to borrow money, only a small wish, to give him a way to avoid the heat net all day long! But who can know the bitter heart of this intention? No one will ever understand.</p>
<p>Summer, is the weather that vents towards the poor, really, the poor have been abandoned and it is irreversible. The husband sighed to his wife, and the wife turned her eyes to the child's face and spanked his butt a few times without a good temper. Wah! The child still didn't understand and cried.</p>
<p>One day, the temperature suddenly dropped by six degrees below! The child was sick, very sick. According to the experienced ones, this is due to the improper adjustment of the climate, and it was because the doors and windows were opened when it was hot and the cold wind invaded the body. The child has no resistance, cannot withstand the double cold and heat, and once it encounters a cold temperature, it flips out! Most of this disease cannot be hoped for?</p>
<p>The wife was anxious to the point of cold hands, but when she touched the child's hand, it was as scary as her own cold, and she fainted! A somersault.</p>
<p>The husband didn't know, outside, he was happy to receive an unexpected income! I bought a bottle of Shashui water and drank two glasses of cold plum soup myself. He knew how thirsty his wife was! With such a bottle of soda to take back, how happy and in need would she be!</p>
<p>Stepping on big feet, it seems to be a lot easier! Pushing the door in, there was no sound! The wife and children were all obediently asleep in bed.</p>
<p>What a day, I'm still taking an afternoon nap?</p>
<p>Still no reply, I was panicked!</p>
<p>Walking closer, pushing his wife's arm felt a little stiff! The child lying upside down on the bed, his eyes turned out so white!</p>
<p>Ah! ··Na··</p>
<p>The bottle slipped from the space between his hands to the back of his feet, and the water soaked through the entire back of his socks!</p>

<h3>Summer Memories</h3>
<p>— Li Kui</p>
<p>It's summer again! The sun is still so hot, and the breeze is still so gentle. Living in this big city, there's no place to even play, it's really lonely and boring!</p>
<p>It really scares me! How will I get through it! Going to the park or the swimming pool requires passes, and those cost money! It's already difficult enough to have no food to eat and no house to live in, how can I have the strength to buy passes!</p>
<p>I can only be lonely and bored! This is a living torture! Being in this situation, how can I not recall that dreamlike past!</p>
<p>It was also such a summer! The sun was also so hot, and the breeze was also so gentle. But at that time, I wasn't lonely or bored!</p>
<p>That was during summer vacation in my hometown! In the morning, we would sit by the river lined with willow trees and fish; the small fish would be "lifted up" one by one (Note), and that was even more enjoyable than eating fish!</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we would all take off our clothes and jump into the big river to swim. After swimming enough, we would lie on the beach to bask; after getting hot, we would jump back into the water to swim; like that, our bodies were the most comfortable!</p>
<p>Sometimes, we would also climb Dongshan Mountain and run to the stone cliffs to pick mountain apricots and sugar pears; standing on the mountain peak, we would look into the distance; or we would dash into the woods to catch mountain sparrows and grasshoppers!</p>
<p>Also, that was when I was at school, and my lover and I would take a small boat to cross to Jiangnan, and along the small path among the willow trees and grass, we would hold hands, shoulder to shoulder, leaning on each other as we walked forward!</p>
<p>Sometimes, we would stand side by side by the river, silently watching the flowing water and white clouds; sometimes, we would run into the dense, secluded forest to kiss!</p>
<p>Ah, all of this is worth remembering! But my heart aches! My lover no longer loves me, and my hometown has been occupied by Japanese imperialism!</p>
<p>I don't know who my lover is embracing in the arms of some rich young man? I don't know what my hometown has become? I don't know when I will be able to see it again? Actually, all of this should be forgotten!</p>
<p>But when I have nothing to do, I can't help but recall that dreamlike memory, that wine-like memory!</p>
<p>Note: "Lift up" means to pull up.</p>
<h3>Discussing Summer Military Training</h3>
<p>— Xing Nan</p>
<p>The summer military training in official documents and the summer military training in reality are two different things.</p>
<p>The summer military training in official documents is of great significance; it is regarded as the harbinger of military national education; it is regarded as the preliminary attempt of conscription. Based on the facts, we feel that the significance of summer military training cannot be as great as described in official documents. There are three reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The relationship between people: Usually, they are the same classmates. If you want me to do this, I can disobey you. Once you become an officer and I become a soldier, and you want me to obey you everywhere, it is difficult for both parties to do so in reality. It is difficult for the officer to be reasonable, and the soldier, honestly speaking, will not be willing. To change a long-term friendship into an officer-soldier relationship in a short period of time seems easy in theory, but there are many difficulties in practice. Therefore, it affects the issue of discipline. "Uniformity" is the first rule of the army. The maintenance of "uniformity" is due to absolute obedience. Now, obedience is difficult, and uniformity becomes a problem. Discipline is fundamentally out of the question. Therefore, even with the authority of the military camp, there are still servants taking soda, ice cream, and cold noodles in and out. Tracing the root cause, it is still due to the looseness of the relationship between people.</p>
<p>(2) Time problem: The original regulation was like this: "All high school graduates must gather at a designated location and receive three months of military training." Later, because this had a considerable impact on the graduates' future paths, it was changed to high school students receiving three weeks of military training during the summer vacation of each academic year. Of course, this is also a way out of desperation, but with each military training separated by a year, there is a question of whether the subjects of the first year can be fully remembered by the time the second year begins. Intermittent training inevitably has the drawback of inconsistent effort.</p>
<p>(3) Inconsistent training: The plan was to concentrate the training, but like Shanghai, there is simply no such large field to provide for the military life of seven thousand middle school students. Inexplicably, we can only train independently in each school, so the training is difficult to be consistent. Although the Training Headquarters has also convened an instructor meeting to stipulate the teaching subjects, it cannot be as consistent as centralized training.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education and the Training Headquarters want to create formal soldiers from summer military training, which is beyond the dreams of fantasy!</p>
<p>Although the significance of summer military training cannot live up to the expectations of the administrators, there are two points that are beyond their ideals and are of considerable benefit to our students, written below:</p>
<p>(1) Hard practice: It is undeniable that our students are good at singing high-sounding tunes. We want merchants not to buy and sell foreign goods, we want farmers to wear homespun cloth, and we scold important people for corruption, but we ourselves are still the happiest and most pleasure-seeking class in the country. In the summer heat, farmers cannot but sow seeds, workers cannot but work, and everyone cannot stop working due to the heat, but we students have our summer vacation. We shout for others to be hardworking, and we ourselves should be hardworking first. Summer military training is not a very difficult thing, but it is at least more difficult than lying around, drinking, and idling. Suffering is also something to be tempered, and summer military training is an opportunity.</p>
<p>(2) Physical fitness: An irregular life is most prone to illness. People who are gluttonous and lazy are often entangled by diseases. If we can regard military training as a serious kind of work, going to exercises, going to classes, eating, and sleeping on time, we will no longer be afraid of bacterial invasion. In the end, military training cannot guarantee the ability to resist the enemy, but it can guarantee the ability to resist bacteria.</p>
<p>A simulated military life has already passed for a week, and it is not as difficult or distressing as I had imagined. I, who have no brothers or sisters at home, especially feel happy to be able to extend the group life for three weeks. I hope that readers will be as happy as I am to receive this three-week summer military training.</p>
<h3>City and Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Qisheng</p>
<p>On the surface, cities appear to be much more hygienic than rural areas, but this is not necessarily true. In rural areas, dirty streets and visible outhouses are common. In cities, the streets are clean, and finding a toilet can be difficult. If the cleanliness of streets and toilets were the standard for measuring the hygiene of cities and rural areas, then naturally, cities would appear much more hygienic. However, the things that are most likely to make residents sick and unhealthy are the toxic microorganisms in the air. These are everywhere in the air of cities, while they are rare or even nonexistent in the countryside. Everyone acknowledges that rural air is fresh, and city air is polluted. City air is polluted due to dense populations and high levels of carbon dioxide, but it is not just polluted; the number of toxic microorganisms within it, when examined under a microscope, is simply alarming. What are these toxic microorganisms? Mostly syphilis and gonorrhea bacteria. Take Shanghai, for example: in addition to open prostitution, there are countless clandestine prostitutes everywhere. Moreover, the group of people who live dissolutely and manufacture syphilis and gonorrhea bacteria are spreading them throughout every corner of the city every day. The air is mixed with the toxic bacteria that are scattered from their bodies and those of their partners, permeating every urban space. You may think you are keeping yourself pure, but you unknowingly inhale these toxic bacteria from the city air, and when you fall ill, you are baffled. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that most people living in cities have impure blood. Therefore, discussing hygiene in the city, when strictly examined in substance, is fundamentally untenable. Current hygiene campaigns, which focus on daily habits of eating and living, can certainly help to avoid being infected by toxic bacteria in the rare case—for example, when people don't spit or urinate indiscriminately, the toxic bacteria on their bodies are less likely to be transmitted to others—but the air is always mixed with the toxic bacteria that are scattered from the breath of those who carry them. No matter how much you emphasize hygiene, you still have to breathe air, and as soon as you breathe air, you become infected.</p>
<p>If cities want to emphasize hygiene, they should fundamentally address the prohibition and prevention of syphilis and gonorrhea. Otherwise, the consequences are unimaginable!</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum</h3>
<p>— Chi</p>
<p>(My eyes are aching and red; as red as two scarlet rose petals. In this season when the air is anxious for the misfortune of the world.</p>
<p>A friend advised me to buy some chrysanthemum to brew with boiling water to quench my thirst.</p>
<p>Summers in my childhood... fresh mint leaves were plucked from the lotus pot and steeped; my mother especially loved to bunch up artemisia and steep it in the tea kettle, cooling it as a beverage—the small-city charm, somewhat tinged with rural flavor, was fully expressed in the summer. In the blink of an eye, it has been so long since I left!</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum brings back nostalgic feelings. But, it has probably also been filtered through the veil of society.)</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum, those small white fluffy ball-like flowers, beige, dry, with a shy and withered layer of petals, hold a melancholy and aggrieved accumulation... of the joy of life... However, I feel even more that it resembles a Chinese woman of the past four thousand years, small in stature, living a chaste and repressed life, a portrait of the bottom... No smile, no sun,... only the wriggling of a ghost in the icy depths, ultimately dying in silence.</p>
<p>Come, liberation!</p>
<p>So, I arranged ten flowers in a glass cup. The boiling water released their mummy-like sorrow!</p>
<p>They unfurled... (even though some petals fell) they floated unsteadily on the surface of the cup; a deep affection, deeply bittersweet, tenderly and charmingly holding hands, leaning against each other...</p>
<p>The buds, those are their hearts! Smiling, breathing rapidly. Tiny bubbles, I understand, whispering!</p>
<p>I carefully covered them with a glass plate.</p>
<p>Amber, a beautiful and peaceful pigment, is their breath! In this amber glass palace, they fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>I carefully observed their drowsiness and secretly kissed them—a clear, light, yet profoundly elegant fragrance, permeated my heart.</p>
<p>I couldn't bear to disturb their breath, so I offered it!</p>
<p>As soon as I touched the glass cup, they lightly jumped like little girls....</p>
<p>Ten hours later...</p>
<p>I was afraid... ghastly green, ghastly green, they disintegrated in the ghastly green. The withered petals settled, and the bands of their hearts were oozing with a seeping green juice...</p>
<p>A ghastly green glass cup, a ghastly green palace! A ghastly green tomb! The ghastly green corpse was already fragmented.</p>
<p>Ghastly green tears stained my ghastly green eyelids.</p>
<p>Ghastly green Chinese women, ghastly green Chinese women!</p>

<h3>Changing Strings</h3>
<p>— Yangyang</p>
<p>Recently, new figures often divorce their old wives and unite with another new target. Such events occur in societies everywhere, to an uncountable extent. The most famous of the former is of course a certain celebrity in the education sector; but of the latter it must be said that a certain famous painter in the art sector! Their "not seeing virtue to the end" stubbornness not only bears the reputation of "seeing the good and loving it," "abandoning the old and cherishing the new," but also fails to adhere to the ancient teaching of "honoring each other's food tray," "growing old together," and moreover, for no reason, not because of any matter, or any ill feeling. Just for no reason, they stiffly sever the marital bond, and break the mirror and split the hairpin, causing accusations to come from all directions, which seems a bit unworthy.</p>
<p>Moreover, the new people they cherish are not ordinary women, but are all widows of deceased friends. From the perspective of old morality and new life, this is certainly a problem that can be discussed. However, under the giant wheel of the new trend era, it is again "commonplace" and extremely ordinary, seemingly not a big deal, not something to be alarmed or surprised about!</p>
<p>Someone once created a term for this kind of trick, called "changing strings." Because when a man's wife dies, it is originally called "breaking a string," and after the wife dies, remarrying a wife is called "continuing a string," as if these life and death unions are all about strings coming and going. So, now that his wife is alive and well, he insists on breaking up with her and remarrying another wife, so the term "changing strings" is used, which is certainly accurate and appropriate, without any doubt.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been many incidents of "changing strings" in China, and at the same time, it can be seen how virtuous Chinese women are? Because those wives who are alive and not dead, if they are sexually consensual to the divorce agreement, no matter how famous or powerful their husbands are, how can they remarry in violation of the law? The more famous and powerful they are, the more they must follow legal procedures to preserve their reputation. Unless they secretly grope around, coming and going secretly, doing the methods of the ancient Mr. Han Shou, but this is also very dangerous. Once the peep show is exposed, immediately all three parties are unhappy, the matter becomes stiff, and it is especially difficult to handle. Recently, there seem to be quite a few celebrities who have borne this kind of criminal responsibility for the combined attack of bigamy and abandonment. Since they have not clearly adopted the "changing strings" system, they cannot avoid becoming criminals of marriage!</p>
<p>It is funny that most of those living wives are willing to abandon their own happiness and become sacrifices for "changing strings," so that their husbands can gain happiness or take advantage of other conveniences in marriage, and then resolutely abandon everything, allowing divorce, so that they can re-sing Guan Ju, and sing beautifully again. This kind of tolerant and yielding behavior, and the benevolent and kind virtue, can indeed make us admire them. However, it reflects how despicable it is that many men who have been washed by the trend often perform the trick of abandoning the old and cherishing the new, and even the new object of union, in her heart, probably also holds sad tears, carrying panic and doubt! Thinking secretly: The past is a warning, don't I also follow the same path in the future? Because women's innate sympathy and soft hearts are inversely proportional to men's. I remember that the ex-wife of a certain famous painter once said to people at the time of the divorce: "Mr. So-and-so is my lover, and I don't want my lover to be unhappy. Also, because my lover must be happy with Ms. So-and-so, I am willing to leave, but I hope the two of them will love each other and live in peace forever." Oh! This one-evening talk, on the surface, is so bright and great, and close to praise. But in reality, every sentence is tears, and every word is blood. It is pitiful that the virtuous Chinese wives under the changing of strings, really have a belly full of grievances, with no way to complain!</p>
<h3>The Last Letter</h3>
<p>— Li Qiong</p>
<p>Dear Sister:</p>
<p>Do you know? I am now sick again in this place where I have no relatives, and I know that my life this time will never have any hope, but we are separated by a long distance, and there is no possibility of making a final meeting! Therefore, I have no choice but to struggle desperately to give you this last letter.</p>
<p>Death is something that everyone cannot escape, but I am still young! I am only twenty years old! None of the things I wanted to do have been accomplished. My life is really too miserable.</p>
<p>Good! Die! Let me die quickly! I don't want to suffer so much and prolong my life, anyway, death only surrounds the poor.</p>
<p>How pitiful! Sick and about to die, taking medicine is of course out of the question, but even drinking a cup of hot water is impossible! Death... God! Please God help me cut off my last breath!</p>
<p>Sister, you have not seen the misery after the so-called recovery of lost land! The houses have become a burnt wasteland, and piles of corpses of men, women, old and young, the stench of which I think you can never imagine! Because my body's resistance is weak, I contracted the epidemic. Death! I have now decided to be with the pitiful oppressed corpses in this recovered area. Sister! If I and this pile of corpses can be resurrected, no, even if our spirits do not die, let us meet again.</p>
<p>You must never let Mom know about my death. Every month, use my name and imitate my handwriting to write a few letters back to comfort her. As long as you can do this, Mom will not know.</p>
<p>Remember Mom once said: "Zhong'er, you go," because there is no way out at home! It is more reassuring for me to let you go out than your brother, because you have such a fat and strong body." God! Who knew that in less than a year of working in the factory, all my energy and flesh were crushed bit by bit by the droning machinery that almost deafened my ears.</p>
<p>I could not bear this ruthless oppression and pain, so I left this sea of ​​suffering, said goodbye to my dear workers, and ran to this newly recovered lost area to do some small errands. Who knew that as soon as I arrived here, every time I put on a neat uniform to go to the countryside to check the household registration, these villagers who had not yet suffered misfortune searched my whole body, and then stared at me and my companions with resentful eyes. When I first encountered this misfortune, I felt very uneasy. I thought, why can't the poor people who are as poor as me sympathize with me? Oh! ···</p>
<p>Please tell my workers to wish them to work hard and bravely towards their bright future. I am awake, I know that oppression and pain can only be lifted in another society!</p>
<p>Okay, I can't write any more, my heart is aching and uncomfortable, I can't cry, I can't shout, and my fingers can't hold the pen anymore. Okay, dear sister! Goodbye forever. I will probably not be able to breathe my last breath tonight. I wish you a bright future</p>
<h3>A Lot of Nonsense (1)</h3>
<p>— Wen Gai</p>
<p>Married people say: "Marriage is the tomb of love." Those who hope to get married in love think: Marriage is really the tomb of love, and they are willing to enter the tomb.</p>
<p>People who have been through it often think they are knowledgeable, but the knowledge of those who walk the path he has walked is like farting when he tells people to turn back. Therefore, people who have been through it often think they are smart, but that piece of advice is something only a fool would say.</p>
<p>Smart people often say: "A fool can also say smart things," in fact, the fool who can say smart things is smarter than a smart person when he speaks.</p>
<p>When a smart person knows that he has done something wrong or said something wrong but does not admit it, he has become a fool without realizing it.</p>
<p>Only a smart person who knows his mistakes and admits them, takes a step forward, and gains people's greater belief is a complete smart person.</p>
<p>Smart people often use scolding methods to subdue the other party, but not only will they not subdue the other party, but will make the other party recognize you: you are a shallow and shameless rogue, and you only have a disobedient heart towards you. However, when a smart person sees that the other party ignores it, he thinks he has won, and is complacent, which shows that the smart person has become a fool.</p>

<h3>I seem to have lost my soul and feel uneasy.</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I now have a problem that is extremely difficult to solve, and I specially ask you, sir, to sacrifice a little precious time and point me out a bright path; I know that you, sir, are the needle of the south for our young people and the savior of the unfortunate, and you will surely be very generous to agree.</p>
<p>I am an unmarried man, thirty-three years old this year, and I graduated from a certain university and have served in the education sector for seven years. I can ask myself that everything in the past can be passed; but in the past two years, one of my students, Ms. So-and-so, is only seventeen years old this year, she is very lively and smart, studies very hard, and her studies have also made great progress. I never thought that she would fall in love with me. In the beginning (two years ago), every time she saw me, she was very affectionate, and she often liked to talk to me at length. At that time, I didn't think it was strange because she was my student, and she was also an innocent child. Besides, it is common for a student and a teacher to talk and talk during their spare time. How do I know that my extremely difficult problem today originated from this.</p>
<p>In the beginning (two years ago), we were just talking and laughing, but later in the spring of last year, unknowingly, we stepped into the web of love. Soon we exchanged letters, watched movies, strolled on the road, etc. The heat of love between the two sides increased day by day. After the annual holiday last year, in order to avoid suspicion, I introduced her to another middle school to study, but the heat of love progressed more quickly, and the correspondence became more frequent. Within three days, we had to meet at least once, or go to see a movie together, otherwise, I seem to have lost my soul and feel uneasy! Let me tell you honestly, from last summer vacation to now, I have received more than eighty letters from her. Judging from this, the heat of our love can be imagined.</p>
<p>Everything in front of us is just the history we have gone through after falling in love. But the core problem of this extremely difficult solution is still below: (1) My age, calculated, is sixteen years older than her. If I want to marry her, will there be any obstacles to the future? (2) We are in the position of teacher and student. Once we become husband and wife, will there be any unexpected complications? (3) Her family is a semi-modern transitional family. What methods should we use to make her parents agree? Because of the above few questions, we are simply sitting and lying uneasy, and there is no way to advance or retreat. Please, sir, have mercy and hurry up and think of a proper way to fulfill our lives. We are endlessly grateful. Sincerely, Mr. So-and-so</p>
<p>Answer: Can't it be truly denied that the pure love is combined because of the teacher-student relationship? Of course, we cannot agree to use the opportunity to contact teachers and students to fall in love. Since you and Ms. So-and-so love each other so passionately and are extremely difficult to separate, it is natural to marry. The age gap is too great, which can make the interests and intentions of both parties unable to approach each other, so marriage with a large age gap has more divorce events than marriage with a closer age. As for the physiological aspects, there is no obstacle, and it is even better for the man to be older. Since you are in love, the interests and intentions of both parties should not be different due to age, so this is not a problem. Third, since her family is semi-modern, you should still use the method of having a matchmaker to propose marriage.</p>

<h3>Lan Jiabao's Mood (4)</h3>
<p>— Xi Jun</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>After a frantic Foxtrot, Karl, sweating profusely, returned to his seat, panting, "It's so hot." He straightened up, his back against the chair, took off his coat, blew cold air from the fan, and then swallowed a few large gulps of lemon iced water. Suddenly his legs lightened, the chair flew, and he fell! Half his body fell, neither left nor right, hitting the shoulder of the black robe. She screamed like a warbler. She turned her head:</p>
<p>—Damn, awkward.</p>
<p>—Sorry, very much.</p>
<p>It was Karl's sincere tone.</p>
<p>She glared at Karl resentfully, but then smiled slightly.</p>
<p>—The iron tree is blooming!</p>
<p>Her heart suddenly brightened.</p>
<p>The music played the hypnotic song of the dead again, the lights dimmed, and Karl, with an adventurous curiosity, was the first to put his arm around the black robe, purely weaving his way into the dance leg forest.</p>
<p>I thought of a lonely heart, squeezed in the green, orange, and blue nights. Along with us. The frustration of disappointed young people! Living a flashy life in the midst of frustration. Forming such a terrible depressed face. She's so lively, and now she's actually smiling, the immeasurable "frustrated young people's mood"!</p>
<p>Karl came back with a smile on his face, and immediately said:</p>
<p>—Her name is Lan Jiabao.</p>
<p>—Did she say anything?</p>
<p>—Very long-winded.</p>
<p>—Still the expression of silence!</p>
<p>—No, she looks quite gentle.</p>
<p>—A mystery!</p>
<p>—The mystery of the young man's heart!</p>
